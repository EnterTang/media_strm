3
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,830
妈妈们好  我是斯蒂芬妮
Hi, moms, Stephanie here.

4
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,290
如我所说  今天我要分享
Today, as promised, I'm gonna share

5
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,560
我的西葫芦巧克力曲奇做法
my zucchini chocolate chip cookie recipe.

6
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,470
但首先  我先说一下很多人关心的
But first, many of you have asked me

7
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,840
艾米丽的最新情况
for an update on the Emily situation.

8
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,470
刚看我播客的人可能不知道
And for those of you who are new to my vlog,

9
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,240
我最好的朋友艾米丽  目前失踪了
you should know my best friend, Emily, is missing right now.

10
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,410
她让我帮她一个小忙
She asked me a simple favor,

11
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,710
去学校接她儿子尼基
to pick up her son, Nicky, from school,

12
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,520
那是五天前的事了
which was five days ago.

13
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,350
她还没回来  所以...
And she hasn't come back yet, so...

14
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,290
很抱歉  我们都很担心
I'm sorry, we're all really worried,

15
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,430
我在尽一切所能帮助警方寻找她的下落
and I'm doing everything I can to help the police track her down.

16
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,540
但我开始意识到我其实根本不了解她
But I'm realizing I don't know her as well as I thought I did.

17
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,340
就好像我妈经常说的
It's like my mom used to say,

18
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,010
愿她的灵魂安息...
God rest her soul. Um...

19
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,040
秘密就像人造黄油
Secrets are like margarine,

20
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,740
容易涂抹[散播]  但对心脏不好
easy to spread, bad for the heart.

21
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,510
虽然我们有各种不同
But as different as we are,

22
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,550
但是我仍将艾米丽看做我最好的朋友
I do consider Emily my best friend.

23
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,580
她是个优雅出色的人
She is this wonderful, elegant person.

24
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,050
说实话  是我们的儿子让我们走到了一起
And our sons brought us together, actually.

25
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,390
新朋友们
Well, for our new friends,

26
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,990
我会从头说起
I'll just start from the beginning.

27
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,790
我是几周前在学校
I met Emily a few weeks ago

28
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,790
认识的艾米丽
at school.

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,700
那是我儿子所在的一年级的
It was International Cuisine Day

30
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,530
国际菜品日
in my son's first grade class.

31
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,430
我又一次做了瑞典菜
And once again, I drew Sweden,

32
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,830
也就是我的拿手好菜素食肉丸
which meant my famous meatless meatballs.

33
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,440
你们都死了
You're all dead!

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,370
我杀了所有人
I killed everyone!

35
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,540
我没有  我起死回生了
Not me. I came back to life.

36
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,440
我想感谢每个人
I want to thank everyone,

37
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,050
参加今天的盛宴  好棒
who participated in today's feast. Yay!

38
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,780
同学们  我们是不是学到了
Class, haven't we learned so much

39
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,550
很多世界各地的食物呀
about food from all around the world?

40
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,790
是
Yes!

41
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,850
来为父母鼓掌  感谢父母
Give your parents a big round of applause.

42
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,490
看起来棒极了
That looks great!

43
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,920
-大笑一个  -我的天
- Big smile! - Oh, my gosh.

44
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,960
她哪来的那么多精力
Where does she get all that energy from?

45
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
你看什么呢
What are you looking at?

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,030
她做的肉丸子里肯定有冰毒
I think there's crystal meth in those meatballs.

47
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,360
家长们  布告栏上有个签名表
Oh, parents, there's a sign-up sheet on the board

48
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,770
是下周的"游乐场"活动的
for our Fun Fair next week.

49
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,970
斯蒂芬妮  拜托你  一个人
Uh, please, Stephanie, don't sign up

50
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,670
只能认领一份任务
for more than one job.

51
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,640
要给所有人当志愿者的机会
I'm not sure everyone else has had a chance to volunteer.

52
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,540
迈尔斯  亲爱的  小心点
Miles, sweetie, sweetie, maybe just be careful

53
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,580
别弄坏了尼基的车车  好吗
with your fingers with Nicky's truck, okay?

54
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,350
尼基的妈妈当过志愿者吗
Has Nicky's mom volunteered?

55
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,950
艾米丽吗  才怪  她根本
Emily? Please. She wouldn't know

56
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,520
不知道签名表是什么
a sign-up sheet if it bit her on the ass.

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,360
天啊  负责丹尼斯·奈龙的公关是我的梦想
God, it'd be my dream to run PR for Dennis Nylon.

58
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,060
你能想象她能得到多少免费的东西吗
Can you imagine all the free shit she must get?

59
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,920
-是啊  -好了
- I know. - Okay,

60
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,590
我把装饰一栏的签名划掉了
I'm crossing myself off decorations.

61
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,060
可以把这个留给艾米丽
I can leave that open for Emily.

62
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,100
如果她没时间
And then if she can't make it,

63
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,960
我可以带我的气球和氦气瓶来
I can still bring my balloons and helium tank.

64
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,430
你不会真的有
Please tell me you don't actually

65
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,400
氦气瓶吧  斯蒂芬妮
own a helium tank, Stephanie.

66
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,770
应该有很多人有氦气瓶吧  斯黛茜
I think lots of people own helium tanks, Stacy.

67
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,440
小孩子都喜欢玩气球
Because kids love balloons.

68
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,840
你没有吗
Do you not have one?

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,710
你这算什么家长  开玩笑的
You a bad parent? I'm kidding.

70
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,140
我们这家长糟糕透了
We're terrible parents.

71
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,950
我觉得这计划很完美  斯蒂芬妮
I think it's a perfect plan, Stephanie.

72
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,710
好想法  斯蒂芬妮
Good thinking, Stephanie.

73
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,020
小宝贝
Hey, Smooch!

74
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,590
今天表现很好  小宝贝
Oh, great work today, Smooch.

75
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,650
小宝贝
Smooch!

76
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,420
-谢谢  妈妈  -不客气
- Thanks a lot, Mom. - Oh.

77
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,460
我和迈尔斯今天放学后能一起玩
Can me and Miles have a play date today?

78
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,430
我不知道  亲爱的
Um, I don't know, sweetie.

79
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,700
得先问问你妈妈
I think we need to ask your mommy,

80
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,560
可她还在市区
and she's still in the city.

81
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,800
她就在那边
She's right there.

82
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,720
过来  小家伙
Come here, little dude.

83
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,960
我的宝贝
Oh, my baby!

84
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,900
看你的衬衣  吃的是不是都沾衣服上了
Look at your shirt. Did any food make it into your mouth?

85
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,870
尼基  快问她
Ask her, Nicky, ask her!

86
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,970
问我什么
Ask me what?

87
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,930
我们想一起玩
We want a play date.

88
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,200
不行  妈妈已经约了
Oh, we can't. Mommy already has a play date

89
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,740
抗抑郁大乐团  走吧
with a symphony of anti-depressants. Let's go.

90
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,840
一起玩  一起玩  一起玩
Play date! Play date! Play date!

91
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,010
宝贝  别这样  我得走了
Baby, please don't do this. I gotta go.

92
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,450
快点  我还有一堆工作要做
Come on. I got a ton of work to do.

93
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,910
你不肯让我玩
You don't let me have any fun.

94
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,780
才没有  你从我身体里出来的时候
That's not true. I let you tear my labia

95
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,750
我让你撕裂了我的小阴唇  不客气
as you exited my body, so you're welcome.

96
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,590
你喝酒吗
Do you drink?

97
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,720
-我要喝一杯马丁尼  -这个...
- I need a martini. - Oh! Uh...

98
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,830
我喜欢喝马丁尼  我都好久没喝过了
Yeah. I like martinis. I haven't had one in a long time.

99
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,630
不过是很好喝  我喝过一杯几乎全是巧克力的
They're good, though. Had one that was mostly chocolate.

100
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,830
我当时想  竟然是酒精和巧克力耶
And I was like, "Alcohol and chocolate!"

101
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,900
当妈的没办法
Mom life.

102
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,040
好吧  别想一起玩了  走吧  孩子
Oh, okay. No play date. Come on, kid, let's go.

103
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,740
那我不走了
Then I'm staying here.

104
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,110
天啊  他真是头犟驴
Christ, he's fucking stubborn.

105
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,480
也不用非得在里面加巧克力
It doesn't have to have the chocolate in it.

106
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,210
好吧  反正我赢不了他  所以...
Okay, I don't think I'm gonna win this, so, um...

107
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,690
你想来一起随便喝点什么吗
I mean, do you wanna come over for a beverage of any kind?

108
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,190
我需要后援
I think I could use some backup.

109
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,820
我是后援吗
That's me? I'm backup?

110
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,490
你儿子喝酒吗
Does your kid drink, maybe?

111
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,520
反正现在教他们喝酒不算早了
I mean, it's never too early to start teaching them.

112
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,660
你肯定在开玩笑  真好笑
I think you're joking, but great.

113
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,190
沃菲尔德小学

114
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,130
-亲爱的  -快走了
- Sweetie... - Hey, you, let's go.

115
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,060
快把你的伞拿出来
Let's get your umbrella out, okay?

116
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,130
我们要雨中漫步了
Because we're gonna go out in the rain.

117
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,570
那两个人会一起聊什么
What on Earth are those two gonna talk about?

118
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,940
艾米丽会把可怜的斯蒂芬妮生吞了
Emily's gonna eat poor Stephanie alive.

119
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,970
至少这说明她还是会吃东西的
At least she'd be eating something.

120
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,710
你搞什么
What is your problem?

121
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,890
带他去你的房间  快去
Go show him your room. Go.

122
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,560
别跑
Oh, please don't run!

123
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,530
小心点
Be safe please!

124
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,090
袜子很可爱
Cute socks.

125
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,860
谢谢
Oh, thanks!

126
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,760
塔吉特百货买的  十块一包
They're from Target. It's 10 bucks a pack.

127
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,230
-塔吉特百货棒极了  -是啊
- So great, Target. - Yeah.

128
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,330
还有其它动物图案的
They have other animals.

129
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,240
有很可爱的小松鼠  花栗鼠
They have these squirrel ones are cute, chipmunks,

130
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,170
海狸...
beavers...

131
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,010
那个真是太...栩栩如生了
That's so lifelike.

132
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,210
是啊
Yeah.

133
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,780
你喜欢吗
Do you like it?

134
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,020
怎么能不喜欢  那...
How could you not? It's, um...

135
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,950
是吧
Right?

136
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,180
我以前经常染头发  我很容易腻
I used to dye my hair. I get bored easily.

137
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,920
嗯
Yeah.

138
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,760
那是你画的吗
Did you paint that?

139
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,690
不是不是  那是纽约东村一个
No. No, no. It's made by an almost famous painter

140
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,690
成名在望的画家画的
from the East Village.

141
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,860
我的生活里充满了各种在望的人
My life is littered with almost-somebodies.

142
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,760
我在学校里当过模特
I did some art modeling in school

143
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,330
为了赚钱交学费
to pay my way through.

144
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,730
后来那个变态变得对我痴迷
Then the pervert got obsessed with me.

145
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,140
是会发生那种事
Oh, well, that happens, yeah.

146
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,570
所以我把画偷了
So I stole the painting, you know,

147
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,970
我以为有一天会值点钱
thinking it'd be worth something someday.

148
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,780
但并没有  不走运
But, no. No such luck.

149
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,810
这房子太棒了
This house is incredible.

150
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,180
谢谢  就是他妈的特别烧钱
Thanks. It's a fucking money pit.

151
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,150
-哎呀  -什么
- Oopsy. - Hmm?

152
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,990
抱歉  我们家里有人说脏话的时候我们会这么说
Oh, sorry. It's, um, what we say at my house when someone swears.

153
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,220
是种习惯
It's a force of habit.

154
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,260
我们的食品贮藏室里有个"哎呀"罐子
We have an oopsy jar in the pantry.

155
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,590
就是
It's like, you know.

156
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,230
每次说脏话在里面放一个硬币
Put a quarter in for every bad word.

157
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,060
应该把那个罐子砸了
You should smash the oopsy jar.

158
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,160
那可能会改变你的生活
That might change your life.

159
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,070
说得对  抱歉
Yeah. Ugh. Sorry.

160
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,230
别这么说
Don't say sorry.

161
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
不需要那样  不需要道歉
You don't need to do that. You don't need to apologize.

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,770
那是失败女人的习惯
It's a fucked-up female habit.

163
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,770
永远不需要为任何事道歉
You don't need to be sorry for anything, ever.

164
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,940
说得对  这建议真棒
That's true. That's great advice.

165
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,210
谢谢
Thank you.

166
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,250
对了  我喜欢这音乐
I love this music, by the way.

167
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,810
谢谢  是不错
Thanks. Yeah.

168
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,920
让我忘记我被困在一个鬼地方
Makes me forget I'm stuck in this shithole.

169
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,320
我要去喝酒了
I'm gonna go get booze.

170
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,660
好极了
Great!

171
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,950
我沉浸在这里的氛围中了
I was really caught up in the ambiance.

172
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,920
别停  再来一段
Come on, give me a little more.

173
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,420
我喜欢  说不定一会儿跟你一起跳
I liked it. I may join you later.

174
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,190
你肯定很喜欢在这个厨房里下厨
Oh! You must love cooking in this kitchen!

175
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,160
并不是  肖恩喜欢
No, not really. Sean does.

176
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,170
我觉得那可能只是他回避写作的借口
I think it's probably just an excuse to avoid writing.

177
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,770
你丈夫是个作家吗
Your husband's a writer?

178
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,800
不是  他十年前写了本书
No. He wrote a book 10 years ago.

179
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,140
那让他成了大名人
It made him the toast of the town.

180
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,340
那会儿我不得不跟踪他
I actually had to stalk him

181
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,510
才让他爱上我的
to make him fall in love with me.

182
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,940
但后来就什么都没有了  他此后什么都没写了
But then, nothing. He never wrote anything ever again.

183
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,450
-这是传统的诱售法  -是什么书
- It's the old bait-and-switch. - What was the book?

184
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,750
叫《黎明的黑暗》
It's called Darkness at Dawn.

185
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,120
天啊  我在读书俱乐部看过那本书
Oh, my gosh! I read that in my book club!

186
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,420
-真的吗  -简直...对
- Really? - This was... Yeah.

187
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,290
那会儿我刚变成单身妈妈
Well, this was back when I first became a single mom,

188
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,760
我加入了个读书俱乐部  那是我们读的第一本书
and I joined this book club, and that was the first book we read.

189
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,690
写得特别棒
It's so impressive.

190
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,730
那你离婚了吗
So you're divorced, then?

191
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,000
寡妇
Widowed.

192
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,200
介意我问问他怎么去世的吗
Do you mind if I ask how he died?

193
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,480
出车祸了
Car accident.

194
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,350
-太可怕了  -是啊
- Oh. How awful. - Yeah.

195
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,950
我哥哥克里斯当时在副驾驶上  所以...
My brother, Chris, was in the passenger seat, so...

196
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,780
开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

197
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,020
一瞬间  两个
One fell swoop, and the two

198
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,090
我生命中最重要的人都去了
most important men in my life were gone.

199
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,090
一般悲惨故事打动不了我
Normally, sad stories don't get to me.

200
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,220
但你这个...
But that one...

201
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,760
成功了  真的太残酷了
That one did. That was brutal.

202
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,460
我不怎么说起这个
I don't talk about it a lot.

203
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,800
尤其是跟我刚认识的人
Especially with people I just met.

204
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,160
真的很抱歉  不好...
I'm really sorry. Oh! Mmm...

205
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,430
宝贝  如果你再道歉
Baby, if you apologize again,

206
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,070
我就不得不扇你让你长记性了
I'm gonna have to slap the sorry out of you.

207
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,000
好  那...我不抱歉
Yeah. That's... I'm not sorry.

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,770
不过这习惯好难改
That's a hard habit to break, though.

209
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,210
确实
It is.

210
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,170
那你现在有男朋友吗
So, are you dating anyone?

211
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,480
没有  沃菲尔德选择很少
No. Slim pickings in Warfield.

212
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,750
你离市区有一个半小时车程
Well, you are an hour and a half outside the city.

213
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,020
我才不会跟市里的人约会
I'm not gonna date someone from the city.

214
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,920
我用过一段时间的网络红娘
I tried eHarmony for a while,

215
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,190
后来那个三个孩子的母亲
and then that mother of three wound up

216
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,390
被砍头丢进垃圾桶的新闻后
with her head in the trash can,

217
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,190
记得吗  我就...
you remember that? And I... Ugh.

218
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,160
只能把软件删掉了
I said, "No thank you. Delete."

219
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,860
怎么了
What?

220
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,990
别这样  亲爱的
Come on, baby,

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,960
你这么性感  怎么能放弃约会呢
you're too sexy to give up.

222
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,070
谢谢夸奖  怎么说呢...
That's nice. I don't know. Um...

223
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,000
如果你的脑袋要进垃圾桶
If your head's gonna end up in a trash can,

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,870
那无论如何都会进的
your head's gonna end up in a trash can.

225
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,440
我是没想到自己会变成单身妈妈
I just didn't think I would end up a single mom,

226
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,210
拼命维持生计
struggling to make ends meet.

227
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,940
我丈夫虽然有保险
I mean, my husband had life insurance,

228
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,480
谢天谢地  但钱不多
thank goodness, but not a lot.

229
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,110
我把其中一半存起来给迈尔斯念大学
I put half of that away for Miles' college,

230
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,080
所以算下来
and so, with that coming in,

231
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,850
那笔钱会在2020年用完
the money still runs out in 2020.

232
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,350
还好有他的保险
Thank God for his life insurance.

233
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,420
是啊
Yeah.

234
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,450
我丈夫什么都没有
My husband doesn't have anything

235
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,560
如果这能让你好受点  但他花钱
if it makes you feel better. But he does spend

236
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,260
可是如流水
like he's the man of the hour.

237
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,160
什么都得我出钱
Fucking have to pay for everything.

238
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,100
我们甚至不能卖了这栋房子
We can't even sell this house.

239
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,800
这是我们在经济泡沫期间买的
We bought it during the bubble.

240
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,470
我很喜欢你的房子
I love your house.

241
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,470
我做梦都不会想卖掉的
Don't dream of selling it.

242
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,740
如果换做我  我会整天埋头于厨房不出去
If I were you, I'd just bask in this kitchen all day long!

243
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,910
那你该搬进来
Then you should move in.

244
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,580
给你   为成为房奴干杯
Here. Cheers to being house poor.

245
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,180
好  干杯
Yes, cheers!

246
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
怎么了
Mmm. What?

247
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,390
那...
That's, uh...

248
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,120
只是我众多糟糕决定中的一个
It's just another one of my bad decisions.

249
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,260
是吗  其实很棒
Yeah. It's great.

250
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,490
那是善举标志吗
Is that a charity symbol?

251
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,830
是啊  我就跟特蕾莎修女一样  所以...
Yeah, Mother Teresa and I are, like, the same person, so...

252
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,160
跟你的戒指有一种反差美
It's a nice contrast with your ring.

253
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,500
谢谢  这是传家宝
Thanks. Yeah, this is a family heirloom.

254
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,100
原来是肖恩的曾祖母的
It belonged to Sean's great-grandmom,

255
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
后来传给了他妈妈
and then his mom,

256
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,070
她坚持要给我  所以就是我的了
and she insisted that I have it, so, you know?

257
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,840
谁的斯巴鲁把车库堵住了
Whose Subaru is blocking the garage?

258
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,840
-说曹操曹操到  -是我的  很抱...
- Speak of the devil. - Oh, that's mine. I'm sorry...

259
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,880
你什么
You're what?

260
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,580
你妻子想让我停止道歉
Your wife is trying to get me to stop apologizing.

261
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,050
或者你可以让她开始道歉
Or maybe you can get her to start.

262
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,320
喝马丁尼了啊
Oh, martini time?

263
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,160
那现在肯定是五点左右了
I'm sure it's 5:00 somewhere.

264
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,290
苍天啊  你刚才是自己
Oh, my God, did you just come up

265
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,460
想到了那句陈词滥调吗
with that cliche by yourself?

266
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,960
他真是个才华横溢的作家
He's such a brilliant writer.

267
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,200
不得不说  是你给了我灵感
I have to say, you inspire me.

268
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,630
显然还不够
Not enough, apparently.

269
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,100
"怎么  非常感谢你
"Why, thank you very much

270
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,600
去杂货店"  他说
"For going to the grocery store," He said,

271
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,340
言语中透露出讽刺
dripping with sarcasm.

272
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,040
我还以为你会想
Oh, I figured you'd want a break

273
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,640
从不想写作中休息一下
from not writing ever.

274
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,240
她以这一致命一击赢得了争论
With that fatal blow, she won the joust.

275
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,080
-干得漂亮  -谢谢
- Well played. - Hmm. Thank you.

276
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,650
-这是斯蒂芬妮  -你好  斯蒂芬妮
- This is Stephanie. - Hi, Stephanie.

277
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,420
她的孩子跟我们的孩子一起在沃菲尔德小学上学
Her kid goes to Warfield with our kid.

278
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,850
她看过你的书
She read your book.

279
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,490
是的  我很喜欢
I did. I loved it!

280
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,120
那让我想到威廉·萨克雷
It reminded me of William Thackeray.

281
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,320
她真的看过
She really read it.

282
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,060
没有多少人
Wow, not many people

283
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,430
拿萨克雷出来作比
trot out Thackeray as a reference.

284
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,560
我是巴纳德英文专业毕业的
Oh, I was an English major at Barnard.

285
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,960
当妈妈前我脑子还挺好使的
It was pre-mommy brain.

286
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,530
我的毕业论文写的是《坎特伯雷故事集》
I did my thesis on the Canterbury Tales.

287
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,570
"阿赛特一说出这个词
"And with that word Arcite gan espye,

288
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,900
这位女士就来回踱步了"
"Whereas this lady roamed to and fro."

289
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,110
"因此  她的美深深伤害了他"
"And with that sight, her beauty hurt him so."

290
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,170
抱歉  你们想开个房吗
I'm sorry, do you guys wanna get a room?

291
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,910
我打扰到你们了吗
Am I breaking this up?

292
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,210
我喜欢
I like that.

293
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,550
你想让我给你调杯酒吗
Hey, do you want me to make you a drink?

294
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,210
不用了  你们玩吧
No. I'm good. You guys enjoy.

295
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,520
我上楼洗个澡
I'm gonna head upstairs for a shower.

296
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
好
Okay.

297
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,590
很高兴认识你  莎伦
Nice to meet you, Sharon.

298
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,420
我也很高兴认识你
Yeah. It's lovely to meet you.

299
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,220
他很不擅长记名字
He's terrible with names.

300
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,590
没事  我这名字很不好记
Oh, yeah. I mean, Stephanie's crazy.

301
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,630
斯什么芬什么
Like P-H-what?

302
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,970
你们夫妻真可爱
You guys are such a cute couple.

303
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,700
我们处于破产边缘
Yeah, we're on the verge of bankruptcy,

304
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,040
而且我们在整个康涅狄格州
and we can't find a decent nanny

305
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,370
都找不到合适的保姆  所以...
in all of Connecticut, so...

306
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,940
快死了
Drowning.

307
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,610
如果需要我接尼基放学
If you ever need me to pick up Nicky after school

308
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,210
然后带他去我家
and take him to my house,

309
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,480
甚至只是想晚上放松一下...
even if you just need the night off...

310
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,550
真的可以吗
You'd do that for me?

311
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,120
当然  没问题
Yeah. Anything.

312
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,690
各位妈妈好  我是斯蒂芬妮
Hi, moms, Stephanie here.

313
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,470
如果你是第一次看我的视频  那热烈欢迎
If it's your first visit to the vlog, a hearty welcome.

314
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,430
今天的主题是友谊
Today's theme is friendship.

315
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,570
所以今天我们制作
So today, I thought we would make

316
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,200
友谊手链
friendship bracelets!

317
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,740
我一直不理解
I have never understood

318
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,980
上班族妈妈和
these silly, hurtful divisions

319
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,210
居家妈妈之间愚蠢又伤人的区别
between working moms and stay-at-home moms.

320
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,650
说实话  我觉得两者
Honestly, I have found it difficult

321
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,480
都不好交朋友
to make friends with either.

322
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,120
艾米丽  你好啊  美女
Emily! Hi, what's up, lady?

323
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,550
你好  我想问问
Hey, I was wondering if I could

324
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,290
你能不能如之前所说去接尼基
take you up on your offer to pick up Nicky.

325
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,290
我正在开会  感觉没有尽头
I'm in a meeting with no end in sight.

326
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,090
好啊  我乐意帮忙
Uh, yeah, I'm happy to help.

327
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,030
其实我正在拿着一大箱拼拼豆...
Actually, I just got this jumbo set of Perler beads...

328
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,490
好好  知道了  你最好了
Yeah, yeah, okay. You're the best.

329
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,430
好的  等等  尼基有什么饮食禁忌吗
Okay. Um, just... Does Nicky have any dietary restrictions?

330
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,600
只要不要给他吃他不喜欢吃的屎就行了  谢了
Yeah, just don't feed him shit he doesn't like. Thanks.

331
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,170
不要给他吃...好
Don't feed... Okay.

332
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,080
天啊  她太幽默了
Oh, my God, she's so funny.

333
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,380
不不不  丹尼斯  我们要这样
No, no, no, Dennis, this is what's gonna happen.

334
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,750
我要做我的工作
I'm gonna do my job,

335
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,180
你要吃点药
you're gonna take some pills,

336
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,320
然后我晚点再打给你  好吗
and then I'm gonna call you later. Okay?

337
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,020
什么  我听不到了
What? Oh, oh, I can't hear you.

338
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:04,420
我进电梯了
I'm in an elevator.

339
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,320
我要吃肉
I am hungry for flesh!

340
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,660
是达斯的妈咪  一个游戏...
Just Darth Mommy, it's this game...

341
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,070
真的很傻
It's really silly.

342
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,370
说实话  他爸爸更擅长
Honestly, his dad was much better

343
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,570
一起陪着大吵大闹
at the roughhousing stuff.

344
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,340
-别这样  -哪样
- Don't do that. - Do what?

345
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,770
不要贬低你在当家长方面的好
Don't denigrate your good parenting

346
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,640
来安慰我这个糟糕的家长
to comfort me for my shitty parenting.

347
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,410
天啊  不  艾米丽  这...
Oh, gosh, no, Emily, that's...

348
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,610
完全不是我的本意
That's not what I was doing at all.

349
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,110
我觉得你是个超级棒的妈妈
I think you're a super mom.

350
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,340
不  你才不是这么想
Oh, no, you don't.

351
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,710
那天午餐你儿子吃的是龙虾汤
Come on, your kid had lobster bisque for lunch the other day.

352
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,520
我记得给我儿子准备午餐就不错了
I'm lucky if I remember my kid's lunch box.

353
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,720
说实话  没关系
Honestly, it's fine.

354
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,120
我能为尼基做的最好的事就是一枪崩了自己
The nicest thing I could do for Nicky is blow my brains out.

355
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,460
我开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

356
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,430
好吧  这真...
Right. Yeah. Well...

357
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,060
你在市里工作  所以...
You do work in the city, so...

358
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,240
-天啊  -天啊
- Oh, my gosh! - Oh, my gosh!

359
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,540
你刚才拍了我的照片吗
Did you just take my picture?

360
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,110
我是负责年鉴的妈妈
I'm yearbook mom.

361
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,840
我让你拍我的照片了吗
Did I ask you to take my picture?

362
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,010
删掉
Erase it.

363
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,480
你看起来真的很潮  很适合"最佳地点人物"
You look really chic, it's just for "Faces and Places."

364
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,820
给其他家长看的而已
Just for the other parents.

365
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,650
删掉  否则我对你的年鉴
Erase it or I'll slap a fucking injunction

366
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,250
申请禁令  明白了吗
on your yearbook, do you understand?

367
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,790
好吧  删掉
Yeah. Okay.

368
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,590
好了  删掉了
Yeah, it's gone.

369
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,190
拜拜了
Whoa. Bye-bye.

370
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,690
别再那么做了
Don't do that again.

371
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,490
天啊  真的很抱歉
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

372
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,600
我不是故意冒犯你的
Or, I didn't mean to offend you.

373
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,330
那种东西肯定
Um... I'm sure that stuff's

374
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,700
在你们这行里是很敏感的
really sensitive in your industry.

375
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,330
没事
Oh, no. It's all good.

376
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,470
我可能不是你通常
I guess I'm probably not the kind of person

377
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,570
会交的那些朋友
you're normally friends with.

378
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,540
你肯定不会想跟我做朋友的  相信我
Oh, you do not wanna be friends with me. Trust me.

379
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,770
丹尼斯  亲爱的
Dennis, sweetie,

380
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,440
我再说一遍
let's try this again. Um...

381
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,840
我要你回家
Okay, I want you to go home

382
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,240
他妈的给我冷静
and chill the fuck out

383
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,720
不要再给我打电话了  拜拜
and don't ever call me again. Bye.

384
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,780
你是这么跟老板说话的吗
That's how you talk to your boss?

385
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,750
是  就得对他们凶一点
Yeah. You know, you gotta go right at 'em.

386
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,150
尤其是那些有权有势的
Especially the powerful ones.

387
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,620
否则他们会对你蹬鼻子上脸
Or they will fuck you in the face.

388
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,660
我知道了
Yeah, I get that.

389
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,190
想离开这里吗
Wanna get out of here?

390
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,560
妈妈需要喝一杯
Mommy needs a drink.

391
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,360
好
Yeah.

392
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,530
非常想
Totally.

393
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,800
尼基
Nicky!

394
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,700
好了孩子们...
Okay, guys...

395
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,840
我们该走了
I guess we're going.

396
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,540
尼基  快点走
Hey! Nicky, come! Now!

397
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,840
好  我有礼物给你  你闭上眼睛
Okay. I have a gift for you. Please close your eyes.

398
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,280
-嗯  -然后伸出你有纹身那只手
- Mmm-mmm. - Yeah. Hold out your tattoo hand, please.

399
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,780
一定要  否则我会等你一整天
This is happening. I'll wait all day.

400
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,320
-你在跟我求爱吗  -是的
- Are you propositioning me? - Yes.

401
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,190
好了  这是我为你做的
Here. I made that for you.

402
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,920
你为我做的
You made this for me?

403
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,420
我觉得跟你那件细条纹西装会很搭
Thought it would go with that pinstriped suit you have.

404
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,890
真的吗  谢谢你
Really? That's nice.

405
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,820
没有人为我这么做过
No one does stuff like this for me.

406
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,400
我喜欢看《家有仙妻》在电视上的重播
I used to watch those Bewitched reruns on TV Land,

407
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,930
我总觉得戴林下班回家后
and I always thought it was so classy

408
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,330
萨曼莎给他端上一杯马丁尼
when Darrin would come from work

409
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,230
是非常经典的画面
and Samantha would fix him a martini.

410
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,800
我们每次这样做时  我都感觉自己特高贵
Every time we do this, I feel so high-tone.

411
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,540
天啊  你真是个呆子
My God, you're such a nerd.

412
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,810
不行  我需要真正的马丁尼
Ugh. Fuck this. I need a real martini.

413
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,440
-这不算真正的吗  -不算
- This one's not real? - Nope.

414
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,350
我和肖恩在伦敦的公爵酒店喝过正宗的
Sean and I had the real thing at Dukes in London.

415
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,650
关键就是冰琴酒
The key, frozen gin.

416
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,420
还有冰的杯子  给
And a frozen glass. Here.

417
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,650
让开  烂马丁尼
Move, bad martini.

418
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,820
好了
Okay.

419
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,760
一点点苦艾酒
Little bit of vermouth.

420
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,930
摇晃一下  倒掉
Swirl it around, dump.

421
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,330
不许去拿毛巾
Don't you dare touch that wash cloth.

422
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,670
然后倒入琴酒
Then add in the gin.

423
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,800
切一片
Cut your twist.

424
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,670
挤出汁  皮朝外  喷一点点
Squeeze it, outside out. Get a nice little mist.

425
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
刮掉边上的  好了
Lick the edges. Voila.

426
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,480
永远不要加该死的冰
And don't add fucking ice. Ever.

427
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,350
我们不喜欢冰块了吗
We don't like ice anymore?

428
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,750
那玩意会毁掉一切
That shit ruins everything.

429
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,450
看来工作很不顺啊
Tough day at work?

430
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,280
我只是偶尔需要重置一下
I just need to hit the reset button sometimes.

431
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,950
干杯
Oh, cheers!

432
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,520
干杯
Cheers.

433
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,330
你能给我调一杯吗
Can you make me one of those?

434
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,700
我看上去像是重置了吗
Do I look reset?

435
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,270
因为我感觉我重置了
Because I feel reset.

436
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,570
你闻上去好香
You smell good.

437
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,570
用的什么香水  你闻上去好香
What is that perfume? You smell so good.

438
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,380
-真想闻上去和你一样香  -谢谢你
- I wish I smelled like you. - Thank you.

439
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,680
是丹尼斯的  我可以给你搞一瓶
It's one of Dennis'. I could get you one.

440
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,910
如果你喜欢的话我可以给你
I could get you a bathtub full

441
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,980
搞一浴缸来
if you'd like.

442
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,820
乐意至极  姐妹
I would love it, girlfriend.

443
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,990
谢谢你
Thank you.

444
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,720
我真的很气我自己擅自不征求许可...
I'm really unhappy with myself for taking that picture...

445
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,260
天啊  你还在提那件事
Oh, my God, are you still talking about that?

446
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,530
...就拍了那张照片  太失礼了
...without asking, it's so rude.

447
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,400
-拜托  忘了吧  -简直就像狗仔
- Please, stop. Forget it. - Just, like, "Paparazzo."

448
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,430
你人太好了
You are so nice.

449
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,930
我真不知道你怎么在这世界上生存下来的
I have no idea how you've survived this long.

450
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,300
我没有你想的那么好
I'm not as nice as you think so.

451
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,640
你在给我下套吗
Are you baiting me?

452
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,710
不  我只是想说
No. I'm just saying.

453
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,380
每个人都有黑暗面
Everybody has a dark side.

454
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,610
有的人更擅长隐藏而已
Some of us are better at hiding it than others.

455
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,380
想交换秘密吗
Wanna trade confessions?

456
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,980
-不不不  -来吧
- No, no. No. - Come on.

457
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,550
你做过的最狂野的事是什么
What's the wildest thing you've ever done?

458
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,420
不  我不知道  我不该说
Oh, no, I don't know, I shouldn't.

459
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,320
你先说
You go first.

460
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,590
好吧
Okay, um...

461
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,520
几个月前  我和肖恩请他的助教过来
Few months ago, Sean and I had his TA over

462
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,330
一起吃晚餐  喝了几杯  然后3P
for dinner, and drinks, and a threesome.

463
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,430
肖恩嫉妒他吗
Was Sean jealous of him?

464
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,640
我说了是个男的吗
Did I say it was a him?

465
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,870
太厉害了  姐妹  太厉害了
That's very cool, sis. Very cool.

466
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,340
-你没事吧  -当然了
- You okay? - Yeah!

467
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,710
我没想吓到你
I don't mean to freak you out.

468
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,450
拜托  我没有吓坏  也许你才吓坏了呢
Hello! I'm not freaked out, maybe you're freaked out.

469
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,610
-好吧  -因为我没有吓坏
- Okay. - Because I'm not freaked out.

470
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,680
我没事  我可是自由放任的
I'm cool. I'm laissez-faire.

471
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,780
好吧  自由放任
Okay, laissez-faire.

472
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,610
你在性方面不算个前卫派
I mean, you're not exactly a sexual maverick.

473
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,320
没关系
And that's fine.

474
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,720
老古董也是人啊
You know, prudes are people, too.

475
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,030
我想知道你的秘密  告诉我
I wanna know your secret. Tell me.

476
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,470
我爸爸在我高中时去世了
My dad died when I was a senior in high school.

477
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,670
然后
And

478
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,040
葬礼上出现了一个男孩
this boy showed up to the funeral.

479
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,570
他的名字叫克里斯
His name was Chris.

480
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,340
他长得简直跟我爸爸
And I guess he was the spitting image

481
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,980
一模一样  就是年轻了30岁
of my father, 30 years younger.

482
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,820
我妈妈以为自己见鬼了
My mom thought she saw a ghost.

483
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,560
原来他是我同父异母的哥哥
And it turned out he was my half-brother.

484
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,890
这就是你全部的秘密吗  你爸爸出轨了
That's your whole secret? That your dad had an affair?

485
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,560
不
No!

486
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,630
好吧  你能直接告诉我你的秘密吗
Okay, can you just tell me your secret?

487
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,770
来吧  说出来  黑暗面
Come on, spill it, dark side.

488
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,870
克里斯
So, Chris...

489
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,770
他再开车回家会很晚了  于是他留宿我家
It was too late for him to drive home, so he stayed over.

490
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,340
我们整晚都在聊天
We stayed up all night, talking,

491
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,880
然后
and

492
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,480
我爸爸
my dad was...

493
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,880
我爸爸是唯一能理解我的人
My dad was really the person who understood me.

494
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,650
他去世了  于是
And he was gone, so...

495
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,820
我很孤独  第一次很孤独
I was alone, alone for the first time.

496
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,490
但他能看穿我  你懂吗
But he sees me, you know?

497
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,830
他真的能看穿我
Like, he really sees me.

498
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,700
我们俩就互相凝视了有一个世纪
And we just stared at each other for the longest time.

499
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,630
你别想在我家喝得太醉
You can't be too drunk in my house

500
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,830
然后话又不说完  然后呢
not to finish the story. What happened?

501
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,610
我不知道
Okay, so, I don't know,

502
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,870
也许在你看来可能没有那么不堪  但是
maybe it's not so racy where you're from, but...

503
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,980
别逃避了  告诉我发生了什么
Stop avoiding. Tell me what happened.

504
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,110
我们站在那儿
We stood there

505
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,540
站了有一个世纪
for the longest time.

506
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,550
然后我就去抱他
So I went in to hug him,

507
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,880
然后我们亲吻了
and we kissed.

508
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,120
我知道  好恶心
I know, it's so gross.

509
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,090
-结束了吗  -对
- The end? - Yeah.

510
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,550
-你们只是亲吻了  -是的  亲吻了
- You just kissed? - Yeah, we kissed.

511
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,790
你只是亲吻了你的哥哥
You just kissed your brother?

512
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,090
-这太...  -什么
- Yeah. It's so... - What?

513
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,490
真是一模一样
Ugh. It's so lurid.

514
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,490
是我同父异母的哥哥  不算亲哥
It's my half-brother. It's not my brother.

515
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,700
但他是你的同父异母哥哥
He's your half-brother, though?

516
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,930
-好吧  -他是我的
- Okay. - He's my...

517
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,970
还有内情
Yeah, there's more.

518
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,470
不  不  没有内情了
No. No, there's not more.

519
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,030
不  就是有
No, no. Yeah, there is.

520
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,100
-那么  -你上了他
- So... - You fucked him.

521
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,500
什么
What?

522
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,870
他活好吗
Was he good?

523
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,070
真是太恶心了
That is so disgusting.

524
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,080
我不知道
I don't know...

525
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,180
你没有上他  告诉我你没有上他
You didn't fuck him? Tell me you didn't fuck him.

526
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,710
我不知道你在想...
I don't know what's going on in your...

527
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,820
-发誓  -我发誓
- Swear. - I swear.

528
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,620
以你父亲的坟墓之名发誓
Swear on your dad's grave.

529
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,740
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

530
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,540
别
Don't.

531
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,640
-你干了你哥哥  -不  别
- You brotherfucker! - No. Don't.

532
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,080
真是太好了
This is good.

533
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,610
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

534
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,480
我让一个干哥哥的人来照顾我的孩子
I've got a brotherfucker taking care of my kid.

535
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,750
我不该说这些的
I shouldn't have even said anything.

536
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,790
干哥哥的
Brotherfucker.

537
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,620
我不知道  都因为这该死的马丁尼
You know what? I don't know. It's these stupid martinis.

538
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,160
上哥哥的  你想留下来吃晚饭吗
Hey, brotherfucker, do you wanna stay for dinner?

539
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,490
我就不该说的
I shouldn't have even said anything.

540
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,560
我想留下来吃晚餐
Yeah, I do wanna stay for dinner.

541
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,660
肯定会很棒的
That would be lovely.

542
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,930
等不及想欣赏你做的菜了
I can't wait to see what you cook.

543
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,600
你知道
You know what?

544
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,100
我要给你做一桌你这辈子吃过最好吃的菜
I'm gonna cook you the best meal of your life,

545
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,670
让你为你现在对我的取笑
and you're gonna feel really bad

546
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,140
而感到内疚
about being so mean right now.

547
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,700
干哥哥的
Brotherfucker!

548
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,170
我喜欢你
I like you!

549
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,110
妈妈们  我是斯蒂芬妮
Hi, moms, Stephanie here.

550
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,980
今天我们要向大家介绍最完美的急救箱
Today we'll be talking about the perfect first aid kit...

551
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,280
让你就算深陷危机也不用惊慌
so you're never left in need during a crisis.

552
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,180
喂
Hi!

553
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,250
斯蒂芬妮  谢天谢地你接电话了
Stephanie. Thank God you picked up.

554
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,150
我有点小小的紧急情况
Hey, I just have a little emergency.

555
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
真的  真巧  我正在...
Oh, really? That's a coincidence. I was just...

556
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,860
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

557
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,060
你没事吧
Are you okay?

558
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,060
我没事  但我需要你帮我一个简单的小忙
I'm fine, but I do need just a simple favor.

559
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,530
你能去学校接尼基吗
Can you grab Nicky from school?

560
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,730
肖恩在伦敦  他的妈妈摔断了屁股
Sean's in London, his mother broke her fucking hip,

561
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,170
我工作上忙不过来
and I got a big fire to put out at work.

562
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,640
当然了  天啊
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God!

563
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,610
可怜的肖恩  可怜的你
Poor Sean, poor you. Um...

564
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,140
乐意至极
Anything I can do to help. Yeah.

565
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,710
你最好了  我得挂了
You're the best. Hey, I gotta run,

566
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,540
但我肯定会好好补偿你的
but I'll get you back for this, okay?

567
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,610
放心吧  尼基就交给我吧
Of course, Nicky's in good hands.

568
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,050
斯蒂芬妮  你是个好人
Hey, Stephanie, you're a good person.

569
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,180
真正的朋友  我是认真的
True friend. I mean that.

570
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,220
别担心  待会再和你聊  再见
Don't worry about it. I will talk to you later. Bye.

571
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,320
不许动  知道我看到什么了吗
Freeze! Do you know what I see?

572
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,130
我看到两个男孩子放学后能一起玩
I see two boys getting a play date!

573
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,860
太好了
Yeah!

574
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,060
斯蒂芬妮  太好了  你当起了保姆
Stephanie, that's so great you took the nanny job.

575
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,670
-保姆  -对  艾米丽的
- Nanny job? - Yeah, for Emily.

576
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,940
我知道她之前就在找保姆
I know she was looking for one.

577
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,340
那么
Well, that...

578
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,240
我们只是朋友  我只是作为朋友来帮她
We're just friends. I'm helping her as a friend.

579
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,740
天啊  我很抱歉
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

580
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,750
我不知道你们关系这么好
I didn't realize you guys were so close.

581
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,780
没错
Well, we are!

582
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,890
我们一起喝马丁尼  伦敦的很烈的那种
We drink martinis together. Strong ones from London.

583
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,220
好了  孩子们  如果你们保证不在车里打架
Okay, boys, if you don't wrestle in the car,

584
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,620
我就给你们做水果爆米花
I'm gonna make you fruit pops!

585
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,820
我们走  走
Let's go, let's go!

586
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,790
她不知道她就是个免费劳力
She doesn't know she's working for free.

587
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,340
我要给尼基洗个澡吗

588
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,590
艾米丽  顺便和你说一下  孩子们玩得很开心
就和你说一下
我要给尼基洗个澡吗

589
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,210
我是艾米丽·尼尔森
This is Emily Nelson,

590
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,650
丹尼斯·奈龙控股公司公关部部长
Director of Public Relations for Dennis Nylon Holdings.

591
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,120
请留言  或者滚吧
Leave a message or go fuck yourself.

592
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,750
小艾  我是斯蒂芬妮
Hey, uh, Em, it's Stephanie. Um...

593
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,220
我知道你现在可能忙得打转
I know you're probably knee-deep in that crisis.

594
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,160
但是尼基在问你什么时候来接他
But Nicky's asking when you're coming to get him,

595
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,290
我不知道该怎么说  所以
and I don't know what to say, so...

596
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,800
和我说一声
Just let me know.

597
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,930
希望你坚持住啦  全部搞定
And I hope you're hanging in there. Give 'em heck.

598
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,700
斯蒂芬妮·斯马瑟斯  我是她的好友
Stephanie Smothers. I'm a close friend of hers,

599
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,970
我在照看她的儿子
I'm watching her son.

600
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,910
你能告诉我她在哪里吗
Can you just tell me where she is

601
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,240
以及她什么时候回来
and when she might be back?

602
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,140
她要在迈阿密待上几天
Yeah, she's in Miami for a few days.

603
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,810
你要留言吗
Did you wanna leave a message?

604
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,710
不好意思  你刚刚是说几天吗
I'm sorry, did you say a few days?

605
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,150
是的  你能稍微等一下吗
Yeah, can you hold for a second, please?

606
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,220
她没有说要花好几...
She didn't say that it was gonna be a few...

607
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,950
妈妈咪呀
Oh, for the love of Joe.

608
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,660
喂
Yes?

609
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,290
肖恩  我是斯蒂芬妮  很抱歉打扰你
Sean, hi! Um, it's Stephanie. I'm so sorry to bother you.

610
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,760
我是在学校名册上找到了你的号码
I got your number from the school directory.

611
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,960
尼基出什么事了吗
Has something happened to Nicky?

612
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,700
不  尼基很好
No! Uh, Nicky's fine.

613
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,800
抱歉  他没事  他和我在一起呢
Yeah, sorry, he's fine. He's here with me.

614
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,970
艾米丽让我帮忙照看他
Um, Emily, though, asked me to watch him,

615
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,310
那是两天前的事了  然后就没有她的消息了
and that was two days ago, and I haven't heard from her.

616
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,680
你和她联系过吗
Have you guys been in touch?

617
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,980
上帝啊  两天
Christ, two days?

618
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,010
她怎么和你说的
What'd she tell you?

619
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,310
她说她工作上忙不过来
Um, she said she had to put out a big fire.

620
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,180
然后我联系了她的办公室
And I called her office,

621
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,810
然后他们说她在迈阿密
and then they said she was in Miami?

622
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,380
听起来没事
Yeah, that sounds about right.

623
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,890
我以前也曾经
I mean, I've played through

624
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,350
遇到过几次紧急情况而离开
some of these emergencies before,

625
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,750
她只要托付好尼基
and once she knows that Nicky's being taken care of,

626
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,960
就会消失一段时间
she disappears for quite some time.

627
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,190
真有意思
Oh, fun! Um...

628
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,260
我明天飞回来
I'm flying back tomorrow.

629
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,700
等我落地就来接尼基回家
I'll pick up Nicky as soon as I'm on the ground.

630
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,760
行吗
All righty?

631
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,100
行
All righty.

632
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,110
坎特伯雷小姐
Miss Canterbury Tales.

633
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,940
她的助手瓦莱丽说
Um, her assistant, Valerie, said that

634
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,210
她也联系不上她
she couldn't get in touch with her, either.

635
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,080
很奇怪  因为这明明是工作上的急事
Which is weird, because it's a work thing, an emergency.

636
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,420
有些妈妈觉得我们应该去找警察
Some of the moms think we should go to the police.

637
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,480
上帝啊
Jesus.

638
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,320
真的发展到这种地步了吗
Has it really come to this?

639
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,050
你要来点茶吗
Do you want tea?

640
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,320
算了  来吧
You know what? Let's do it.

641
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,030
不是指茶  而是报警
Not the tea. The police.

642
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,790
-肖恩  -嗯
- Sean? - Yeah.

643
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,200
警察来了
The police are here.

644
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,230
好的
Okay.

645
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,840
你们俩最后一次
And when was the last time

646
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,010
有她的消息是什么时候
either of you heard from her?

647
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,980
三天前
Three days ago.

648
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,180
我当时在伦敦  我妈妈摔断了屁股
I was in London. My mother broke her hip.

649
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,310
-我很遗憾  -谢谢
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - Thank you.

650
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,920
她说是工作上的危机吗
Well, she said it was a work crisis?

651
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,050
她的工作很高调
Yeah. She has a very high-profile job

652
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,450
手下要管理一大群人
and a full staff that she oversees.

653
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,050
一般女性失踪
Most times when a woman vanishes,

654
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,460
总是有原因的
she has a reason.

655
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,160
你到底在暗示什么
What are you implying, exactly?

656
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,060
你们俩没有吵架吗
You two didn't have a fight?

657
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,490
让你匆匆飞去了伦敦
Something to make you run off to London?

658
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,130
你是说我摔断了我妈妈的屁股吗
Are you saying that I broke my mother's hip?

659
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,130
你出城了  你妻子就走了
You leave town, your wife takes off.

660
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,970
也许
Maybe there's, um,

661
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,470
她可能去找某个亲密的朋友去了
a close friend she might be spending some time with.

662
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,410
不好意思  你这样说太无礼了
Excuse me, that's very rude.

663
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,440
他是一名尽心的丈夫和父亲
He is a dedicated husband and father.

664
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,310
我见过他和他妻子一起  我告诉你们
I have seen him with his wife, let me tell you,

665
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,540
他们俩之间的火花比做科学实验时都要多
they've got more chemistry than a science fair.

666
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,680
我们只是在考虑所有的可能性  女士
Just exploring all avenues, ma'am.

667
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,280
那个可能性是个死胡同  你不用考虑了
Well, that avenue is a dead end, so you can drop it.

668
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,350
艾米丽的家人在哪里
And where's Emily's family?

669
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,990
她没有家人
She doesn't have any.

670
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,090
她是家中独女
She was an only child,

671
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,930
她的父母在她十几岁时都过世了
and her mother and father died when she was a teenager.

672
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,530
我很抱歉  我不知道
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

673
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,060
我们会提交失踪人口报告
We'll file a missing person's report

674
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,830
接下来几天会联系你
and contact you in the next couple of days.

675
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,230
如果她还是没有出现
If she doesn't turn up,

676
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,530
我们会联系迈阿密的当地警方
we'll contact the local authorities in Miami.

677
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,970
接下来没有计划出行了吧  汤森德先生
Not planning any more trips, are you, Mr. Townsend?

678
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,040
没有了
No.

679
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,070
我会好好待在这里
I'm gonna be right here.

680
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,410
我会和我儿子一起待在我的家里
I'm gonna be at my house with my son.

681
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,050
不用送我们了
We can show ourselves out.

682
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,850
我们俩以前是有过争吵
God knows we've had our troubles in the past,

683
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,820
但我不知道她会就这么丢下自己的孩子
but I don't think she'd just up and leave her child.

684
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,060
不  上帝  她很喜欢尼基  她不会这么做的
No, God, she adores Nicky. She wouldn't do that.

685
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,020
我的妻子是一个谜一样的女人
She is an enigma, my wife.

686
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,490
所以我才被她所吸引
That's what drew me to her.

687
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,060
也让她如此难以相处
It can also make her impossible.

688
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,000
她有的时候会非常看重个人隐私
She can be so fiercely private.

689
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,960
我告诉你
She sure doesn't like

690
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,100
她是绝对不喜欢别人拍她照片
having her picture taken, I'll tell you that.

691
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,330
我记得有一次  她注销了我的脸书
I remember this one time, she shut down my Facebook

692
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,500
因为我发了一张家庭合照
because I posted up a family picture.

693
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
社交媒体真是一言难尽
Ugh. Social media is so tricky.

694
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,840
我可以陪在她身边
I can get to close to her,

695
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,470
但我却永远无法靠近她
I can never quite reach her.

696
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,210
她就像一个美丽的鬼魂
She's like a beautiful ghost.

697
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,050
永远不是全部的她
Never entirely there.

698
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,480
太有诗意了
That's so poetic.

699
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,520
难怪你是一名如此优秀的作家
That's why you're such a good writer.

700
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,120
我已经不是作家了  斯蒂芬妮
I'm not a writer anymore, Stephanie.

701
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,020
我为了下半生与这个女人相伴
I gave all that up just to chase this woman

702
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,020
而放弃了一切
for the rest of my life.

703
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,290
我该叫辆出租车回家了
I should order a taxi and go home.

704
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,960
嗯
Yeah.

705
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,430
天啊  1点25分了  1点就没有车了
Oh, gosh, it's 1:25, they stop driving at 1:00 here.

706
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,440
如果你想睡在这里
That couch pulls out, um,

707
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,200
可以把这张沙发拉出来
if you wanna stay over.

708
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,040
我知道尼基明天早上
I know Nicky would love it

709
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,110
看到你肯定会很高兴的
if you were here in the morning.

710
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,280
那就太好了
That would be lovely.

711
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,190
谁想再来点维他命B
Who wants more B vitamins?

712
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,360
-要  -我要
- Yeah! - I do!

713
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,160
好吃吗
Yeah? Are they nice?

714
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,200
-嗯  -好吃吗
- Yeah. - Yeah? Delicious?

715
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,070
你在什么呢
Uh, what on Earth are you making?

716
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,340
这些是宿醉冰沙
These are hangover smoothies.

717
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,110
能一扫你的疲惫
They get it right out of you.

718
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,340
孩子们很喜欢
And the kids love them.

719
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,940
小贴士  这里面
Little tip, they have a full portion

720
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,080
可全是蔬菜
of vegetables in them,

721
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,080
他们都不知道
and they don't even know it.

722
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,120
让孩子们吃蔬菜真是太难了
It's so hard to get kids to eat their vegetables.

723
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
对吧
Right?

724
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,220
想试试吗
Wanna try some?

725
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,920
好啊
Great.

726
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,200
不错吧
Good?

727
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:20,200
我觉得我们该准备去学校了
I think we should get ready for school.

728
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,870
学校  学校
Oh, school, school.

729
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:54,200
你的孩子们会吃的蔬菜

730
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,070
妈妈们  我是斯蒂芬妮
Hi, moms, Stephanie here.

731
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,540
今天我要做一道新的菜
Today I'm making a new recipe

732
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,710
我学会了一种宿醉冰沙
I learned for a hangover smoothie.

733
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,710
真的很棒
Uh, it's really nice.

734
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,680
我想谢谢那些
I especially want to thank everybody

735
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,250
留言询问关于艾米丽的事的朋友们
who's written in to ask about Emily.

736
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,920
已经过去四天了
It's been four days now.

737
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,850
那么
So...

738
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,990
好消息是肖恩从伦敦回来了
The good news is that Sean is home from London,

739
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,230
他正在和警方密切合作
and he's working very closely with the police.

740
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,130
事实上  妈妈们
Um, actually, moms,

741
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,000
我知道你们很多人都觉得
I know a lot of you are hung up on the idea

742
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,070
丈夫永远是首要嫌疑人
that the husband is always the primary suspect.

743
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,940
我知道  我看过《法律与秩序》
I know, I've seen Law & Order.

744
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,600
但是
But, um...

745
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,140
首先  我要告诉你们
First, I'm here to tell you

746
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,040
艾米丽消失的时候  肖恩在伦敦
Sean was in London when Emily disappeared.

747
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
你们有些人暗示
And some of you have suggested

748
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,680
他这样做是为了不在场证据
that he did that to set up an alibi,

749
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,320
但他是一名优秀的丈夫和父亲  所以...
but he's an amazing husband and an amazing father, so...

750
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,920
警察没查出什么结果
The police haven't been much help.

751
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,120
但是每个妈妈都知道  你要是想要做好一件事
But every mom knows that if you want something done right,

752
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,260
那就必须亲力亲为
you have to do it yourself.

753
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,030
我不会放过每个细节
I will leave no stone unturned.

754
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,690
丹尼斯·奈龙

755
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,730
我觉得这也是艾米丽想要的
I think that's what Emily would want.

756
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,100
丹尼斯·奈龙公司  请稍等

757
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,150

761
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,340

丹尼斯·奈龙公司  请稍等

764
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,680
谢谢你的等待  请问你要转到哪里
Thanks for holding. How may I direct your call?

765
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,610
我试图联系她的助理
I tried to call her assistant.

766
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,780
-丹尼斯·奈龙公司  请稍等  -瓦莱丽
- Dennis Nylon, please hold. - Valerie.

767
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,850
她没提供什么有用信息
She wasn't super helpful.

768
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,420
谢谢你的等待  请问你要转到哪里
Thanks for holding. How may I direct your call?

769
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,620
我不知道你有没有在和我说话
I can't tell if you're talking to me.

770
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,020
你虽然看着我
You're looking right at me.

771
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,120
-丹尼斯·奈龙公司  请稍等  -好吧
- Dennis Nylon, please hold. - Okay.

772
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
谢谢你的等待  请问你要转到哪里
Thanks for holding. How may I direct your call?

773
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,460
她叫艾米丽·尼尔森
Her name is Emily Nelson.

774
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,190
她是公关部部长
She's the head of the PR department.

775
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,530
艾米丽今天没有上班
Emily's not in today.

776
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,200
我知道她没有上班
I know she's not in.

777
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,460
-丹尼斯·奈龙公司  请稍等  -好吧

00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,800
抱歉  不  我一点都不抱歉
Sorry. No, I am not sorry.

780
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,510
我要找丹尼斯·奈龙  谢谢
I need to speak to Dennis Nylon, please?

781
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,170
一个女人失踪了  所以...
A woman's missing, so...

782
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,280
奈龙先生现在不在
Mr. Nylon's not here right now.

783
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,410
好吧  那我等
Great, I'll wait.

784
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,580
请便
Knock yourself out.

785
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,620
好的
Okay.

786
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,570
丹尼斯·奈龙公司  请稍等
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

787
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,830
奈龙先生
Um, Mr. Nylon?

788
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,700
我们不接收现场递交的简历
We don't accept unsolicited resumes.

789
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,240
太好了  我不是为此而来的
Cool, that's not why I'm here.

790
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,340
我们有麻烦了
Um, we have a problem.

791
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,140
我想也绝对是麻烦大了
We most certainly do.

792
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,470
我的一个朋友在你的公关部上班
A friend of mine works in your publicity department...

793
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,050
这是一条爱马仕老式围巾吗
Is that a vintage Hermes scarf?

794
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,210
我的弗里达姨妈给我的
My Aunt Frieda gave it to me.

795
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,680
她想让你用它上吊吗
Did she want you to hang yourself with it?

796
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,280
看看这结打的  我的天啊
Look at that knot, Jesus fucking Christ!

797
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,180
我是为了艾米丽·尼尔森的事来的
I'm here about Emily Nelson.

798
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,850
艾米丽怎么了  出什么事了
What about Emily? What happened?

799
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,190
她四天前要我去接她的儿子
She asked me to pick up her son four days ago

800
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,520
因为她去了迈阿密
because she went to Miami.

801
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,360
到现在也没有回来  没有短信  没有电话
She's still not back. No texts, no calls,

802
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,630
你的办公室里好像没有人他妈的在乎这件事
and no one in your office seems to give a crap.

803
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,630
抱歉我爆粗口了
Excuse my language.

804
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,180
基可
Kiko?

805
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,430
艾米丽为什么要去迈阿密
Why did Emily go to Miami?

806
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,800
我不知道她去了
I didn't know she did.

807
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,740
作为在这里工作的人  我们知道
We in this office have learned that

808
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,440
当艾米丽选择不告诉我们某些事时
when Emily elects not to tell us something,

809
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,840
最好别多问
it's best not to ask.

810
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,310
她不是为你工作的吗
Doesn't she work for you?

811
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,610
艾米丽的工作是阻止舆论崩塌
Emily's job is to stop the apocalypse

812
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,480
不要烦扰到其他设计师
without worrying any of the designers.

813
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,810
她总是能把事情
And she always finds a way

814
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,350
解决得令人赏心悦目
to look fabulous when she does it.

815
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,650
太棒了
That's great!

816
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,890
那你觉得我该怎么办
What do you suggest that I do?

817
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,320
永远不要用老式围巾配商场买的衣服
Never wear a vintage Hermes scarf with a Gap T-shirt.

818
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,490
如果你真的是艾米丽的朋友  你肯定知道的
If you were truly Emily's friend, you would know that.

819
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,560
不好意思  我今天很忙
Excuse me, I have a very busy day.

820
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,200
瓦莱丽  去我办公室
Valerie, my office.

821
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,830
艾米丽·尼尔森
公关部长

822
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,020
马上
Now!

823
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,790
无关人等
不得入内

824
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,310
你好
Hi.

825
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,350
坐下  坐下  艾米丽  我要答案
Sit, sit, sit! Emily! I want answers.

826
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,720
史蒂文  你忘记拿衬衫了
Steven, you forgot the shirts.

827
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,850
艾米丽·尼尔森
公关部长

828
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,800
不  我可以帮你
No, I can't help you with that.

829
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,230
他当然气疯了
Of course he's freaking out.

830
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,640
他需要赶紧找人来处理
He needs someone to manage this now.

831
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,810
我不知道
I don't know.

832
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,490
我的天啊
Mother fudger.

833
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,290
要有信心

834
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,350
这不是弗里达姨妈
Well, if it isn't Aunt Frieda's

835
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,480
最不喜欢的侄女吗
least favorite niece.

836
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,820
你在这里干什么
What were you doing up there?

837
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,290
刺探商业机密吗
Corporate spying?

838
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,720
还是说你只是一个普通的小贼
Or just a common garden shoplifter?

839
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,820
就得对他们凶一点
Yeah, you gotta go right at them.

840
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,260
尤其是那些有权有势的
Especially the powerful ones.

841
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,860
否则他们会对你蹬鼻子上脸
Or they will fuck you in the face.

842
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,500
听着  你这个只能待在地下室的汤姆·福德
Listen, you bargain basement Tom Ford,

843
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,730
如果你不让你的马仔肯
if you don't have this Ken doll

844
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,800
赶紧放开我
unhand me this second,

845
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,770
我就告诉上千名看我播客的妈妈
I will tell the thousands of moms that watch my vlog

846
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,000
丹尼斯·奈龙是个只会欺负女人的混蛋
that Dennis Nylon is a bully who victimizes women.

847
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,740
她们就不会再从你手中购买印度尼西亚童工
And that they should stop buying your tacky blouses

848
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,970
所制造出来的俗气衬衫
made by Indonesian children.

849
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,410
因为如果你失去妈妈们的支持  你的事业就完了
Because if you lose moms, you lose business.

850
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,550
好吧  首先
Okay, number one,

851
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,880
那些不是印度尼西亚童工
they are not Indonesian children,

852
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,580
而是越南青少年
they are Vietnamese teenagers.

853
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,690
其次  汤姆·福德巴不得能变成我呢
Number two, Tom Ford wishes he were me.

854
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,760
再者  如果我还俗气
And number three, if I'm tacky,

855
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,760
好吗
okay?

856
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,590
那你就...
You're...

857
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,760
和你聊天很开心
This has been fun.

858
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,870
你最好祈祷我不用买衬衫
Better pray I don't have a bruise.

859
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,890
要有信心

860
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,480
难怪她不喜欢被拍照
No wonder she doesn't like having her picture taken.

861
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,470
你见过她吗

862
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,680
瞧瞧我们的小斯蒂芬妮
Look at our little Stephanie.

863
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,790
安慰着焦急的丈夫
Comforting the worried husband.

864
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,850
拜托
Oh, please.

865
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,390
这可是一个手工项目
It's an arts and crafts project.

866
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,060
只要能用上订书机的活  她就绝对不会放过
I've never seen her pass up a chance to use a stapler.

867
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,060
等艾米丽回来肯定会
Emily's gonna hate those flyers

868
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,800
恨死这些传单
when she gets back.

869
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,270
她不会再回来了
She's not coming back.

870
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,770
你们没看过《美国报道》吗
Don't you watch Dateline?

871
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,240
如果前72小时之内没有找到人
If the case isn't solved in the first 72 hours,

872
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,910
基本就是死了
they're always dead.

873
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,640
没错
Oh, yeah.

874
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,580
来得正好
Oh, perfect timing!

875
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,650
晚餐准备好了
Dinner's ready.

876
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,750
孩子们都在楼上
The boys are upstairs.

877
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,550
我去给他们洗洗手
I'm just gonna have them wash their hands

878
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,650
就下来
and come down.

879
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,350
你没事吧
Are you okay?

880
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,420
我只是从来没有过这种体验
I've just never experienced anything like this.

881
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,860
回到家  桌子上已经摆好了晚餐
Walking into a fully set dinner table.

882
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,330
没错  的确很奇怪
Yeah, this is weird.

883
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,530
-我是...  -不不不  没关系
- I'm being... - No, no, no! Not at all.

884
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,330
这年头  安稳的生活
I think anything stable these days

885
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,970
简直能算是天赐的礼物了吧
is like a gift from heaven, right?

886
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,600
我得先去洗一下
I should tidy up first, though.

887
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,340
-汤森德先生  -是我
- Mr. Townsend? - Ah, yes.

888
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,780
我是苏默维尔警探  我们通过话的
Detective Summerville. We spoke on the phone.

889
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,110
没错
That's right. Um...

890
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,350
斯蒂芬妮  你能去帮孩子们完成作业吗
Stephanie, can you help the boys with their homework?

891
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,010
当然了
Of course.

892
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,880
-请进  抱歉  -谢谢
- Come in. Sorry. - Thank you.

893
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,320
一点餐前零食
Just a pre-dinner snack.

894
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,660
这保姆真漂亮
That's a cute nanny.

895
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,660
不  那是我妻子的一个朋友
No, no. That's one of my wife's friends.

896
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,030
她一直在帮我
She's been helping me out.

897
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,000
靠  那她能帮忙也收拾一下我的房子吗
Oh, shit. Can she come help out around my house, too?

898
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,740
查遍空运名单
The passenger manifest says

899
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,740
她并没有乘坐飞往迈阿密的航班
she wasn't on any flights to Miami.

900
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,040
但是她倒是从巴吉特租了一辆白色的起亚汽车
But she did rent a white Kia from Budget.

901
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,810
用现金支付了两日的租金
She paid in cash for a two-day rental.

902
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,780
当人们用现金付款时
Now, when people pay in cash,

903
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,510
那通常只说明一件事
it usually means one thing.

904
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,610
你什么意思  她出轨了吗
What are you saying? She's having an affair?

905
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,050
我无法断言
I can't say that with any confidence.

906
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,780
你就不能追踪那辆起亚汽车吗
Can you not track the Kia?

907
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,450
我可以查到
I have toll booth reports coming in

908
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,650
全国收费站的报告
from across the country,

909
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,520
如果她没有换车牌的话
assuming she's not swapping out plates.

910
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,020
我需要你具体描述你妻子的长相
I wanna get a description of your wife to

911
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:59,030
发给三州的每个分局
every precinct in the tri-state area, okay?

912
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,090
她有没有什么明显的特征
Did she have any distinguishing features?

913
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,400
胎记  纹身什么的
Any birthmarks, tattoos?

914
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,570
她的左手臂上有一个纹身
She's got a tattoo on her left wrist.

915
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,630
很好
Oh, great.

916
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,640
中间是火焰和善举图案
It's flames and a charity symbol in the middle.

917
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,610
认真的吗
Really?

918
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,740
你连这都要嘲讽
More judgment from you?

919
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,910
不不不
Nope. No, no, no.

920
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,170
但她就是会做出这种事
But she did things like that.

921
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,480
疯狂  冲动的事
Impulsive, crazy things.

922
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,050
我会上报的
I'm gonna go call this in.

923
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,580
帮我向你妻子的朋友告个别
Tell your wife's friend I said goodbye.

924
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,720
你真是一个圣人
You're a saint.

925
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,150
你没有必要这么做的
You don't have to do that.

926
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,620
我不是圣人  我只是想找点事做
I'm not a saint. I just like to keep my hands busy.

927
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,590
我要走了
Um... I should go.

928
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,190
周一是世界旗帜网日
It's Flags of the World day on Monday.

929
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,900
我连南美的都还没开始做
I haven't even started on South America.

930
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,670
抱歉
Sorry.

931
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,530
不  我不是想说抱歉  我是想说谢谢
No, I don't mean sorry. I mean thank you.

932
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,440
谢谢你作为一个朋友这么上心
Thank you for being such a good friend.

933
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,470
当然了
Of course.

934
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,940
我是专门解决问题  我只希望我能做到更多
I'm a problem-solver, I just wish I could do more.

935
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,380
你已经做得够多了
You're doing plenty.

936
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,520
这是我们今天的节目
So, that's where we are today.

937
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,790
我们要抬起头来
And we are keeping our heads up

938
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,520
不能妄下结论
and not jumping to any conclusions.

939
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,890
我们要全力
We are soldiering on

940
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,030
做好饼干和手工折纸
with cookies and origami.

941
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,590
但是想要帮助的妈妈们
But for you moms who want to help,

942
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,760
我们知道艾米丽开着一辆
we know that Emily was driving a white Kia

943
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,600
她在24号从拉瓜迪亚机场的
that she rented from a Budget

944
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,200
巴吉特租的白色起亚轿车
at La Guardia Airport on the 24th.

945
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,670
我做了点小小的调查
And I did a little digging,

946
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,870
车牌号是
so, um, the license plate is...

947
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,030
亲爱的斯蒂芬妮
Dear Stephanie,

948
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,720
我在密歇根州的斯坦迪什给你发邮件
I'm writing from Standish, Michigan,

949
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,330
我可能看到了艾米丽
with a possible Emily sighting.

950
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,760
我两天前在I75公路上开车
I was driving down I-75 two days ago,

951
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,900
看到一个女人在给一辆白色起亚汽车加油
when I saw a woman gassing up a white Kia.

952
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,950
她长得非常漂亮
She was really pretty,

953
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,470
我还记得我当时想她看上去
and I remember thinking she didn't look like

954
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,830
不像是这儿的人
she was from around here.

955
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,690
我希望能帮到你
I hope this helps.

956
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,510
苏默维尔把信息发给了
So, um, Summerville sent the info

957
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,900
密歇根州当地的警方
to the local authorities in Michigan.

958
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,670
她有没有提到过密歇根州  她在那里有没有朋友
Did she ever mention Michigan? Did she have a friend there?

959
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,670
据我所知  她没有什么真正的朋友
As far as I knew, she didn't have any real friends.

960
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,040
在你之前
Not before you.

961
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,920
那怎么可能呢
How is that possible?

962
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,200
沃菲尔德警方

963
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,930
喂  请告诉我你们找到她了
Hello. Please tell me you found her.

964
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,450
湖
A lake?

965
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,190
我不知道
Well, I don't know.

966
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,590
我马上过去
Okay, I'm heading there now.

967
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,860
他们在密歇根州找到了那辆租的车
They found the rental car in Michigan.

968
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,730
我要赶紧出发了
Look, I'm gonna have to go

969
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,830
不然我就要疯了
because otherwise I'm going to go crazy.

970
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,570
-你能帮我个忙吗  -当然了  去吧
- Can you do me a favor? - Yes, it's done. Go.

This probably isn't the best entry to start with.

天父啊  在我们困难之际

我们再次看向您

我们的痛苦  悲伤和孤寂

指引着我们

989
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,170
只有在您怀中才能寻得些许慰藉

990
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,140
请特别支持和照顾那些

991

与去世之人尤为亲近的人

让他们能够安下心来

993

00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,080
新生从此开始

离开这具躯体

996
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,820

再次并肩前行
in your blessed presence.

1000

帮助我们记住
Help us to number our days

1001
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,970
用我们的善意取代智慧的时候

1002
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,100
以圣父
In the name of the Father,

1003
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,740
圣子和圣灵之名
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

1004
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,310
阿门
Amen.

1005
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,910
你好
Hi.

1006
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,910
你好
Oh, hi.

1007
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,020
这些是...
Are those, um...

1008
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,880
没错
Oh, yeah, yeah, they are.

1009
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,650
这是你的紧急布朗尼
They're from your last-minute brownie entry.

1010
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,990
真不敢相信你在看我的播客
I can't believe you watch my vlog.

1011
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,360
老实说
To be honest,

1012
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,790
我们刚开始看的时候
when we first started watching it,

1013
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,230
只是在取笑你
we were just making fun of you.

1014
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,930
但是
But, um...

1015
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,130
然后  你给了很多实用的小贴士
But then, you had some really helpful hints in there.

1016
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,130
特别是卢卢长疹子的时候
Especially when Lulu got that rash,

1017
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,100
苹果醋很有用
apple cider vinegar was great.

1018
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,700
太好了  那真是...
Oh, well, great! That's...

1019
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,040
你真是一个圣人
You're a real saint

1020
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,310
这样帮助她的家人
to help her family out like this.

1021
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,570
我不是圣人
I'm not a saint.

1022
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,280
艾米丽是我的朋友  换成是我  她也会这样做
Emily was my friend, and she'd do the same for me, so...

1023
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,910
如果你和肖恩需要我
If you or Sean need me

1024
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,780
照顾迈尔斯或者尼基  尽管提
to watch Miles or Nicky anytime, it's nothing.

1025
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,220
你真是太好了  索娜  谢谢你
That's so sweet, Sona. Thank you.

1026
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:50,290
这是她应该做的  她没有烘烤蛋糕
It's the least she could do, she didn't even bake anything.

1027
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,630
-对  -好吧
- Yeah, yeah. - Okay.

1028
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,690
尼基
Nicky,

1029
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,130
你不用担心
you don't need to worry.

1030
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,730
你妈妈现在上天堂了
Your mom's in heaven now.

1031
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:59,330
不  她没有  闭嘴
No, she's not! Shut up!

1032
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,460
-她在地下  -住手
- She's in the ground! - Ow! Stop it!

1033
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,830
她不会再回来了
She's never coming back!

1034
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,200
你弄疼我了
Ow! You're hurting me!

1035
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,940
-我恨你  -住手
- I hate you! - Ow! Stop it!

1036
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,170
尼基  放开他
Nicky, get off him!

1037
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,240
尼基  你在干什么  放开他
Nicky, what're you doing? Get off him!

1038
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,940
你在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

1039
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,910
冷静点  住手
Calm down, stop that.

1040
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,280
都怪她  她害我妈妈死的
She made this happen! She made my mom die!

1041
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,750
你乱说话  你自己明白的
That's crazy and you know that.

1042
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,050
她想做我的新妈妈
She's trying to be my new mom!

1043
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,150
亲爱的  我没有想做你的妈妈
Sweetie, I'm not trying to be your mom.

1044
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,320
我要我的妈妈
I want my mom!

1045
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,390
我知道  宝贝  我知道
I know you do, baby. I know you do.

1046
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,790
-但是你得冷静下来  -妈妈说的对
- But calm down. - Mom was right!

1047
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,060
你是个废物
You are a loser!

1048
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,820
她是这么和你说的吗
Is that what she told you,

1049
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,060
她下午两点钟喝的醉醺醺
drunk at 2:00 in the afternoon?

1050
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,190
-我尽力了  -肖恩
- I am trying my best! - Sean!

1051
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,800
他只是个孩子  上帝啊
He's just a little boy. Jesus!

1052
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,300
尼基  对不起
Nicky, I'm sorry.

1053
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,970
-我怎么办  -好吧
- What do I do? - Okay.

1054
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,130
我怎么办
What do I do?

1055
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,470
我们都深吸一口气
We're all gonna take a deep, centering breath now.

1056
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,000
准备好了吗
Ready?

1057
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,400
我们要一件一件事情的来
We're gonna focus on one thing at a time.

1058
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,410
我会留在这里和尼基谈谈
I'm gonna stay and talk to Nicky.

1059
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,010
你把迈尔斯带到屋子里
So I need you to take Miles inside,

1060
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,380
给他鼻子上敷点冰块
put some ice on his nose.

1061
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,180
因为你马上要肿起来了
'Cause you got a good little shiner coming.

1062
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,880
-没事的  -好
- It's okay. - Okay.

1063
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,250
没事的
It's okay.

1064
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,720
我不想和你说话
I don't wanna talk to you.

1065
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,960
你现在也算不上我最喜欢
You're not my favorite dinner date

1066
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,090
晚餐男伴  小坏蛋
right now either, buster.

1067
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,290
但是你要知道你现在所有的感受
But you should know that everything

1068
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,300
都是很正常的
you're feeling right now is normal.

1069
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,500
你可以随便发泄  没关系
You can act out all you want. That's fine.

1070
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,300
那也改变不了我所知道的事实
This doesn't change what I know.

1071
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,840
你知道什么
What do you know?

1072
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,970
你是个好孩子
That you're a good kid.

1073
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,780
我们就坐在这里  不说话吧
So let's just sit here and not talk.

1074
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,880
我们就坐在这里
Let's just sit here

1075
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,080
满心抑郁  看着这些草
and feel lousy and watch the grass grow.

1076
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:03,020
拜托  不要太责怪你自己
Hey, come on. Don't be hard on yourself, yeah?

1077
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,320
这种事谁都处理不好
It's the kind of stuff nobody gets right.

1078
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,320
你就可以  你永远能处理好
You do. You always do.

1079
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,100
不  不  拜托
No, no, come on.

1080
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,950
我不知道...
Um... I don't know if...

1081
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,320
-没错  我们不该  -没错
- Yeah, we shouldn't. - Yeah.

1082
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
操
Fuck.

1083
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,080
认真的吗
Are you serious?

1084
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,460
斯马瑟斯小姐
Hey, Ms. Smothers!

1085
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,000
-我能和你谈谈吗  -好的
- Can I talk to you? - Yeah. Um...

1086
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:35,370
我马上下来
I'm gonna come right down.

1087
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:39,440
该死
Shit!

1088
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,640
我落了点东西在这  所以我...
Uh, I just left something here, so I was just...

1089
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,050
我有一把钥匙
I had a key

1090
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,750
因为之前  肖恩给了我一把钥匙
because earlier, Sean gave me a key...

1091
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,320
你没有被捕  斯马瑟斯小姐
You're not under arrest, Miss Smothers.

1092
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
顺便告诉你
FYI.

1093
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,650
我希望没有
I should hope not.

1094
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:57,220
-好吧  不  不  -不
- All right. No, no. - No.

1095
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,260

- You're very funny. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1096
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,460
肖恩现在不在
Sean's not here right now.

1097
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,300
我其实是来找你的
You know, I was actually hoping to speak to you.

1098
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,300
我去了你家
Yeah, I went by your house.

1099
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,700
然后我去了学校
Then I went by the school,

1100
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,700
然后有个妈妈说你可能会在这里
then one of the moms thought you might be here.

1101
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,740
是吗  那真是...
Did they? Okay. Well, that's...

1102
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:14,740
是史黛西吗
Was it Stacy?

1103
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,670
我能进去吗
Can I come in?

1104
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,540
-当然了  请进  -谢谢
- Of course, I would love that! - Thank you.

1105
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,250
你说艾米丽是你最好的朋友
You said that Emily's your best friend.

1106
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,380
是的  是的  没错
Yes. Yes, we are.

1107
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,550
-她抑郁吗  -不
- Was she depressed? - No.

1108
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,190
不  她什么都有
No, she had everything.

1109
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,690
她有大房子  还有工作
She had the house and the job...

1110
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,760
还有好丈夫
And the husband.

1111
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,320
我正要说呢
I was getting there, yeah.

1112
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,460
邻居倒是说他们经常争吵
The neighbors said they fought a lot.

1113
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,100
他们是有过不和...
Well, they had issues. Um...

1114
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,200
但是他们深爱着彼此
But they loved each other intensely.

1115
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,400
他们有什么不和呢
Oh, what issues did they have?

1116
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,170
普通的不和
The normal issues.

1117
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:45,070
他们因为钱而有压力
They were stressed about money.

1118
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,810
我觉得艾米丽想要放缓步伐
And I think Emily wanted to slow down

1119
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,440
细嗅蔷薇
and smell the roses.

1120
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,310
她的确是放缓步伐了
She slowed down all right.

1121
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:54,210
我拿到了解剖报告
I got the autopsy report right here.

1122
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:56,310
我们来看看
Let's see here.

1123
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,350
"严重的肝脏损害说明大量酗酒
"Severe liver damage suggesting heavy alcohol use.

1124
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:03,190
"手臂和脚趾之间布满针孔"
"Track marks along her arms and between her toes."

1125
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,790
你知道她在用海洛因吗
Were you aware of the heroin use?

1126
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,630
不  那...
No, that's, uh...

1127
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:13,160
抱歉  我真的
I'm sorry, I really have

1128
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:14,770
不敢相信
trouble believing that.

1129
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,170
她喜欢很烈的马丁尼  但是
She liked a very strong martini, but...

1130
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:21,840
我不知道她怎么能向我隐瞒这么大的事
I don't know how she could've kept that a secret from me,

1131
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,340
特别是连她的丈夫  肖恩都不知道
and especially from her husband, Sean.

1132
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,340
你好像很了解肖恩
Yeah, you seem to know Sean pretty well.

1133
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,780
我...我们过去的几周
I... We've gotten to know each other

1134
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,820
作为朋友  互相有所了解
over the last few weeks, just as friends.

1135
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,590
我想你以前应该从来没有和
I'm guessing you've never dealt

1136
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:37,260
执法部门打过交道吧
with law enforcement before.

1137
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,400
没怎么打过交道
Not really, no.

1138
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,370
这条裙子很漂亮
That's a really nice dress.

1139
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,170
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

1140
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:53,400
不过看起来不符合你的风格
Doesn't seem to be your style, though.

1141
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:56,270
我可是有很多面的  警探
Oh, I'm very versatile, Detective,

1142
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,710
你以后就知道了
I think you'll find.

1143
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,480
我真的只是想在肖恩和尼基这么悲伤时
I'm really just trying to help Sean and Nicky

1144
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,580
来帮助他们
in their time of grief.

1145
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,850
肖恩有多么悲伤
Oh, how is Sean's grief?

1146
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,850
他还可以
He's holding up very well.

1147
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:09,290
基本可以预想到
As well as can be expected.

1148
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,920
没什么事...
Is that everything, or...

1149
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:15,400
我问你
Let me ask you something.

1150
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,800
你知道
Were you aware

1151
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,370
他在艾米丽死前
that he took out an extra $4 million

1152
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,700
给她多投了
life insurance policy

1153
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,470
四百万的人生保险吗
on Emily before she disappeared?

1154
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:30,640
我不知道  不知道
I was not aware of that, no.

1155
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,810
为什么这么问  我怎么会知道
Why? How would I?

1156
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,320
好吧
Okay, all right.

1157
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,620
我不是...
Yeah, I don't...

1158
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:42,360
对不起  这...
I'm sorry. What...

1159
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,390
你在...
What are you...

1160
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:46,720
你是说他把她杀害了吗
Are you saying he had her rubbed out?

1161
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,230
他雇了一个杀手吗
He hired a hitman?

1162
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,760
我没说他雇了一个杀手
I didn't say anything about him hiring a hitman.

1163
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:54,860
是你说的
You just did.

1164
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:56,670
好吧
Okay.

1165
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,300
我能看得出来你很乐在其中
I can see that you're enjoying yourself,

1166
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,440
苏默维尔警探
Detective Summerville.

1167
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,970
但是如果你想要找人逼问  你应该
But if you wanna grill someone, you should

1168
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:03,510
找找艾米丽的上司  丹尼斯·奈龙
really speak to Emily's boss, Dennis Nylon.

1169
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:05,310
他实在是太可疑了
He could not be more suspicious.

1170
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:07,580
真有意思  因为正是他联系我的
That's super interesting because he contacted us.

1171
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,680
他说他觉得你有所隐瞒
And he said he thought you knew more than you were letting on.

1172
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,020
他是个烂人
Well, he sucks.

1173
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,520
那么
So...

1174
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,820
只要你说实话  斯马瑟斯小姐
As long as you're honest with me, Ms. Smothers,

1175
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,990
我发誓
I swear to you,

1176
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:20,920
你不用担心我  好吗
you have nothing to worry about. Okay?

1177
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:24,690
我只是在顺着面包屑寻找真相
I'm just following breadcrumbs wherever they lead.

1178
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,430
这样吧  暂时到此为止吧
Okay, you know what? I'm done for now.

1179
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:28,470
谢谢你抽出时间
Thanks for your time.

1180
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:31,040
你的猜测根本站不住脚  你知道的
Your theory doesn't hold water, you know,

1181
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,440
因为这根本解释不了
because it doesn't explain

1182
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,740
伪造的机票和租的汽车
the fake plane ticket or the rental car.

1183
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,940
以及他们为什么要在密歇根的一个夏令营
And why would someone shoot her full of heroin

1184
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,210
给她身上注射海洛因
at a summer camp in Michigan?

1185
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,280
康涅狄格州就有很多的好海洛因
There's plenty of good heroin right here in Connecticut!

1186
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,310
我听说的
I'm told.

1187
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:44,920
很好  看来我们有很多好谈的
Great, good. Okay, so we have a lot to talk about.

1188
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,580
那好吧  好好享受你的新房子
All right, then. Enjoy the new house.

1189
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:49,290
你的面包屑是就我所知最烂的面包屑
The worst breadcrumbs I've ever heard of, you know.

1190
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:50,450
这种面包屑绝对不能
Couldn't fill a Caesar salad

1191
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,760
用来做凯撒沙拉
with those breadcrumbs!

1192
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,670
你能签一下这文件吗  保险那儿马上需要
肖恩

1193
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,510
这凯撒的[剖腹]莎拉为什么这么脆
Why is this Caesarean salad so crunchy?

1194
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,290
是凯撒莎拉  非常好吃
It's Caesar salad, baby, and it's delicious.

1195
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,920
里面加了什么
What's in it?

1196
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,420
面包屑
Breadcrumbs.

1197
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,960
你今天工作怎么样
How was your day at work?

1198
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,990
痛苦
Grim.

1199
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,160
花了一整天跟大学新生
Spent most of the day explaining the difference

1200
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,630
解释"你的"和"你是"的
between "Your" Possessive and "You're" Apostrophe R-E

1201
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:08,530
所有格的区别
to college juniors.

1202
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,500
看得出来的确能让一个人发疯
I can see how that might drive a man over the edge.

1203
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,140
对吧
I know, right?

1204
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,570
孩子们呢
What about you boys?

1205
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:16,770
你们今天在学校里做了什么
What'd you guys get up to today at school?

1206
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,980
我看到了我妈妈
I saw my mom.

1207
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,650
我明白  尼基  有时候
I understand, Nicky, that sometimes

1208
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,590
虽然我们很想念的人已经去世了
we think we see people that we miss

1209
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,880
我们还是觉得自己看到了她
even if they're gone.

1210
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,520
不  我看到她了
No, I saw her.

1211
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,720
她在课间就站在
She was right outside the fence

1212
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,560
踢球场的篱笆外
by the kickball yard at recess.

1213
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,590
有很多人看上去很相像
Lots of people look like someone else.

1214
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,860
没有人像妈妈
Nobody looks like Mom!

1215
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,670
她要我向斯蒂芬妮问好
She told me to say hi to Stephanie.

1216
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,170
尼基
Nicky,

1217
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:43,770
这样做不好
this is unhealthy.

1218
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:45,770
迈尔斯也看到她了  对吧  迈尔斯
Miles saw her, too. Right, Miles?

1219
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,610
我想是吧
I think I did.

1220
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:49,740
但我不知道
But I don't know.

1221
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,140
我在玩绳球
I was playing tetherball.

1222
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,980
你们俩商量好的吗
Did you two hatch this up?

1223
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,180
这是什么游戏吗  就像你们用火车撞掉所有东西
Is this a game, like when you smash everything with trucks?

1224
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,780
我们可是说过不能撒谎的
Because you know what we say about lying.

1225
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:59,420
我没有撒谎  我看到她了  去你妈的
I'm not lying! I saw her! Fuck you!

1226
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,820
尼基
Hey, Nicky!

1227
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,430
对不起
I'm sorry.

1228
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:16,670
我没有晚安吻吗
Don't I get a kiss good night?

1229
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,600
你当然有了  亲爱的
Of course you do, sweetie.

1230
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,540
其实你之前说了脏话  应该往
Actually, you owe the oopsy jar a quarter

1231
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,980
哎呀罐子里丢钱  但我
for earlier, but I...

1232
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,780
晚安  亲爱的
Good night, sweetie.

1233
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,400
我们应该脱光光
We should get naked.

1234
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:46,870
怎么了
What is it?

1235
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,000
怎么了
What's wrong?

1236
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,540
我闻到她了  肖恩  我闻到了她的香水味
I smell her, Sean. I smell her perfume.

1237
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,870
像鬼魂一样留在尼基身上
It's all over Nicky like a ghost.

1238
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,240
他可能是拿了她放在药柜里的
He probably got to her perfume bottle

1239
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,940
香水罐子
in the medicine cabinet.

1240
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,780
他很想她
He misses her.

1241
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,080
这只是你在胡思乱想
Okay? It's just you being paranoid.

1242
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,150
是吗  我还找到了这个
Is it? Because I found this, too.

1243
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,120
这是什么
What's this?

1244
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,620
这是我给她做的友谊手链
It's the friendship bracelet I made her.

1245
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,190
恐怕她不会戴着这个的
I'm afraid to say she would not have kept this.

1246
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,620
她很讨厌这种东西
She hated stuff like this.

1247
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:13,790
她可能在你给她后
She probably gave it to him

1248
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,230
就转手给了他
right after you gave it to her.

1249
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,230
除非他说的是实话
Unless he's telling the truth.

1250
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:19,670
你亲眼看到了她的尸体
You saw her with your own eyes.

1251
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:21,800
在她的棺材里
In her coffin.

1252
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,200
有点不对劲
There was something off.

1253
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,270
他们在湖底找到了她
They found her at the bottom of a lake!

1254
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,800
你看到了她的纹身
You saw her tattoo,

1255
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:29,010
你看到了她从我母亲手中偷走的戒指
and you saw that ring that she stole from my mother.

1256
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:33,210
她说是你的母亲给她的
She said your mother wanted her to have that ring.

1257
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,650
她说是你母亲坚持要给她的
She said your mother insisted.

1258
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:37,010
她是这么告诉你的吗
That's what she told you?

1259
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,180
这枚戒指是我父亲给我母亲的
My father gave that ring to my mother.

1260
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:40,550
这是她这辈子
It was like the only bit of jewelry

1261
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:41,820
唯一一件首饰
that she ever owned.

1262
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,750
我和艾米丽私奔后  我带着她
I took Emily to London to meet my mother

1263
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,990
回伦敦见我母亲
after we eloped.

1264
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:47,660
戒指就是在那个周末不见的
It went missing that weekend.

1265
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,730
我妈妈急疯了  我们哪里都找过了
My mother was frantic. We searched everywhere.

1266
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:52,160
一无所获  我们什么都没找到
Nothing. We didn't find a single thing.

1267
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:55,570
我妈妈大受打击
My mother was devastated.

1268
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,040
然后我们坐飞机回纽约
So we took a flight back to New York.

1269
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:59,770
猜猜我找到了什么
Guess what I found.

1270
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:02,010
你找到了什么
What did you find?

1271
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,240
不是吧
No!

1272
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,980
不可能
No way!

1273
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,580
我的小夏洛克·福尔摩斯
My little Sherlock Holmes.

1274
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,310
妈妈这下肯定能放心了
Mum is gonna be so relieved.

1275
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,220
拜托  宝贝
Oh, come on, baby.

1276
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,960
妈妈肯定会把它带进土  多浪费啊
Mum will take it to the grave. What a waste.

1277
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,950
这么美
So pretty.

1278
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,920
不好意思
Excuse me.

1279
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,760
这不好笑  亲爱的  一点都不好笑
Not amusing, my darling, not in the slightest.

1280
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,560
我一点都没有在开玩笑
I'm not joking in the slightest,

1281
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,330
亲爱的
my darling.

1282
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:26,330
我拿的
I took it.

1283
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:28,700
我没打算还回去
I don't have any intention of giving it back.

1284
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,900
我们当然要还回去了
Of course we're gonna give it back.

1285
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,600
不
No.

1286
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,940
我们就告诉她这不小心
We'll tell her that it just slipped

1287
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,200
滑进了你的包里
into your purse by accident,

1288
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,740
我们刚刚才找到
and we've only found it now.

1289
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,680
但如果你告诉她是我找到了
But if you tell her that I found it,

1290
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,180
我就告诉她是我偷的
then I have to tell her that I stole it.

1291
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,580
你觉得哪种对她来说更糟糕
And what do you think will be worse for her?

1292
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,750
觉得自己丢了戒指
Thinking that she lost her ring,

1293
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,590
还是觉得自己的儿子娶了个贼
or thinking that her son married a thief?

1294
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,090
宝贝
Baby...

1295
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,220
你来选择  她还是我
You choose, her or me?

1296
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,260
20秒后到厕所找我
Meet me in the bathroom in 20 seconds.

1297
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,300
敲两次门
Knock twice.

1298
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,320
九个月后  尼基出生了
Nine months later, Nicky was born.

1299
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:29,390
你怎么能和她过下去
How could you stay with her?

1300
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,660
我被迷住了
I was spellbound.

1301
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,760
我满脑子里只有她
She was the only woman

1302
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,200
一个女人
I could never figure out fully.

1303
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,330
作为一个年轻傲慢的作家  我绝对不可能
As a young, arrogant writer, I could never

1304
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:38,370
变成她想要的样子
live up to what she expected of me.

1305
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:40,170
我总是提心吊胆
I was always looking over my shoulder.

1306
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:41,610
睡都睡不好
I could hardly sleep.

1307
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:44,840
但是跟你一起不一样
But with you, it's different.

1308
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,280
我睡得像头猪
I sleep like a log.

1309
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,010
女人就喜欢听这句话
That's what every woman wants to hear.

1310
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,080
你懂我的意思
You know what I mean.

1311
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,850
你理解我  能看透我
You understand me, you see me.

1312
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,720
你让我获得新生  斯蒂芬妮
You've rebuilt me, Stephanie.

1313
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,150
我又开始写作了
I've even started writing again.

1314
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,990
才写了前几章
First couple of chapters,

1315
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,190
但那是个好开头
but it's a start.

1316
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,160
真棒
That's wonderful.

1317
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,060
你接纳一个破碎的男人
You took a broken man,

1318
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:09,400
再重新将他拼凑了起来
and you pieced him back together again.

1319
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,870
你不像我见过的所有女人
You're unlike any other woman I've ever met.

1320
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:14,840
搬来和我一起住吧
Move in with me.

1321
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,170
肖恩
Sean.

1322
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,910
不  太快了  别人会怎么想
No, it's too soon. What will people think?

1323
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:21,210
他们早就有他们的想法了
They're already thinking it.

1324
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:23,810
我厌倦撒谎了  我厌倦假装了
And I'm tired of lying. I'm tired of pretending.

1325
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:24,950
我想成为
I want to be this man.

1326
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:27,020
和你一起的男人
The man I am with you.

1327
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,190
我不玩3P
I don't do threesomes.

1328
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:31,320
我想这么说
I want to say that.

1329
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,790
我先把话说开
I'll just get that out in the open.

1330
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:34,420
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

1331
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:36,090
你的助教
Your TA?

1332
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,700
艾米丽告诉了我你们的小爱好
Emily told me about your little moment.

1333
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,000
-她是这么告诉你的吗  -是的
- That's what she told you? - Yes.

1334
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,070
斯蒂芬妮  听着
Stephanie, listen.

1335
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,270
艾米丽是个病态的骗子
Emily was a pathological liar.

1336
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:46,270
从来没有那种事  好吗
That never happened, okay?

1337
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,310
你为什么给她买了
Why did you take out a $4 million

1338
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:51,110
四百万的人身保险
insurance policy on her?

1339
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,740
天啊  这些警察真的是把你洗脑了啊
My gosh. Those cops really did a number on you, didn't they?

1340
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,080
我是认真的
I'm being serious.

1341
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,910
那是因为你
It was because of you.

1342
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,380
自从艾米丽发现你一直
When Emily found out that you had been

1343
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:01,190
靠着你丈夫的保险金生活
living off your husband's insurance money,

1344
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,820
她就觉得我们俩也应该为了尼克
she thought she and I needed to get policies

1345
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,290
做个保险
out for Nicky's sake.

1346
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:07,260
这可能是我们迄今为止做过的最负责任的事
It's probably the most responsible thing we ever did.

1347
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,360
多亏了你
Thanks to you.

1348
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,160
搬进来和我住吧
Move in with me.

1349
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:15,770
我们可以一起开始全新的生活
We can start a whole new, wonderful life together.

1350
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:17,340
只有你  我和孩子们
Just you, me and the boys.

1351
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,240
拜托  答应我
Please, say yes.

1352
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:26,410
我爱你  斯蒂芬妮·斯马瑟斯
I love you, Stephanie Smothers.

1353
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:30,150
我也爱你
I love you, too.

1354
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,350
房屋出售

1355
01:01:46,970 --> 01:02:04,450
安息吧

1356
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,930
妈妈们  我是斯蒂芬妮
Hi, moms. This is Stephanie here.

1357
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,900
今天我要做一些不一样的事
I'm gonna do something a little different today.

1358
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,330
我一般会避免在播客上说到涉及宗教的事
I normally avoid any talk of religion on the vlog.

1359
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:58,370
我不想冒犯任何不信教的妈妈们
I don't wanna offend any non-denominational moms.

1360
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,140
但是我相信我们死后还是会存于世上  所以
But I do think that we live on after we die, so...

1361
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,540
艾米丽
Emily,

1362
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,140
如果你在
if you are out there,

1363
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:09,350
你能听到我现在说的话
and you can hear me right now,

1364
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,520
没人能取代你
no one could ever replace you.

1365
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,550
你永远是尼基的妈妈
And you'll always be Nicky's mom.

1366
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:16,990
我无法取代你的位置
I can't take your place.

1367
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:21,160
我只能努力去爱你爱的这些人
I can just try to love the people that you love

1368
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,560
让他们的生活变得更好
and try to make their lives better.

1369
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,300
我觉得这是你所希望的
I think that's what you would want.

1370
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,000
伙计们  你们有点太闹了
Okay, guys, it's getting too rough back there.

1371
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,870
我杀了你
I murdered you!

1372
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:37,310
我没有  我死而复生了
Not me. I came back to life.

1373
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:38,980
就像你妈妈
Like your mom!

1374
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,610
把娃娃们放回你们的包里
Okay, the dolls are going in your backpacks

1375
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:42,110
不然我就全扔了  我是认真的
or they're going in the trash, I mean it.

1376
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:45,480
妈妈  它们不是娃娃  天啊
Mom, they're not dolls! God!

1377
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,890
斯蒂芬妮  我妈妈要我给你这个
Stephanie, my mom told me to give you this.

1378
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,890

If you can't tell me, you can't tell anyone.

1450

I just want the truth.

1453
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,100

迈尔斯和克里斯
About Miles and Chris.

没错  你的哥哥
Yeah, your brother.

1457
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,810
你装得一点都不像
And you certainly don't act like it.

1458
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:34,740
有时候更像是你俩才是恋人  对吧
Sometimes it's more like you guys are lovers, right?

1459
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,480
真恶心  这...
That's disgusting. That's...

1460
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,720
迈尔斯到底是不是我的孩子
Is Miles mine or not?

1461
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:43,720
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

1462
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,750
你听听你自己说的话
Are you listening to yourself?

1463
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,320
多么荒谬
You sound ridiculous.

1464
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:48,760

只是去兜兜风

男人之间  说两句
Have a little talk. Man to man.

1471

No problem.

1472
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:29,430
都是我的错
It's my fault.

1473
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:33,240
他们俩的死都是我的错
I'm the reason they're both dead.

1474
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,870
不
No.

1475
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:36,540
别这么做
Hey, don't do that.

1476
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:39,340
人们会因为他们自己的破理由
People do terrible things

1477
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,510
干出很多可怕的事
for their own fucked-up reasons.

1478
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:41,580
怪他们自己
That's on them,

1479
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:42,580
-不怪你  -嗯
- it's not on you. - Yeah.

1480

哪一个
Which one?

1482
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,560
都很想
Both.

1483
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,890
我好孤独
I'm lonely.

1484
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,370
我觉得因孤独而死的人肯定比因癌症死的人多
I think loneliness probably kills more people than cancer.

1485
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,370

1486

天啊  天啊  我太丢人了
Oh, God. God, I'm so embarrassed.

1489
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:40,800
因为什么  不  没事的  宝贝
Oh, because of that? No, hey. It's all good, baby.

1490
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:42,470
没事的  只是一个普通的星期二
It's all good. Just another Tuesday.

1491
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:58,730
戴安娜·海兰

1492
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,420
走开
Go away.

1493
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,750
戴安娜·海兰
Diana Hyland?

1494
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:30,920
这是你画的吗
Did you paint this?

1495
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,300
你这是在哪里找到的
Where on Earth did you find it?

1496
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:48,340
我要先告诉你一些坏消息
I should start by giving you some unfortunate news.

1497
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:50,680
艾米丽死了
Emily's dead.

1498
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,910
节哀顺变
My condolences.

1499
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:54,410
艾米丽是谁
Who the fuck is Emily?

1500
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,450
画里的这个女孩
The girl in the painting.

1501
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,380
很好
Good.

1502
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:02,690
她的名字不叫艾米丽
Her name's not Emily.

1503
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:03,690
她叫克劳迪亚
Her name's Claudia.

1504
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:07,360
安息吧  混蛋
Rest in peace, asshole.

1505
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,530
看来不是什么很好的回忆了
So, not a pleasant memory for you, then?

1506
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:12,360
恰恰相反  她很棒
No, opposite. She was amazing.

1507
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,100
她简直是我遇见过最棒的人
I mean, she was the best that I ever had.

1508
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,670
我当时在卖画
I was selling paintings.

1509
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,100
那是我职业生涯中
You know, it was the first time

1510
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:20,100
第一次喝了点小酒
in my career that I had any buzz.

1511
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:22,000
她走进了我的画廊
She walked into my gallery.

1512
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:24,710
凭空突然出现了一位活生生的女神
A real fucking muse just right out of thin air.

1513
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:25,910
然后呢
What happened?

1514
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:27,410
我笔下只有她
She was all I could paint.

1515
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,110
我能记得她身体的每一寸
I memorized every inch of her body.

1516
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,780
我的画商恨之入骨
My dealer fucking hated it.

1517
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:34,650
评论家们都恨之入骨
And the art critics fucking hated it.

1518
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:37,990
摄影家

1519
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:37,990
他们叫我疯同性恋梅普勒索普
They called me a knockoff dyke Mapplethorpe.

1520
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:41,020
反正我为了画那个冒牌艺术家而葬送了职业生涯
Anyway, I blew my whole career painting that con artist.

1521
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:43,460
现在我只能画这些该死的刀子
Now all I paint are these goddamn knives,

1522
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,760
画得真棒  但是没人想买这堆垃圾
which are pretty good, but nobody wants to buy this shit.

1523
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,000
什么  这些都很棒  人们都是嫉妒
Oh, what? They're so good. People are just jealous.

1524
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,670
我已经42天没有喝酒了
I haven't had a drink in 42 days.

1525
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:55,770
不要...
Oh, don't...

1526
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:57,640
也许还是庆祝一下吧
Might as well celebrate.

1527
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,850
干杯
Mmm, well, cheers.

1528
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,320
我给了她我的心和我的灵魂
I gave her my heart and I gave her my soul.

1529
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:09,890
我给她出钱上大学
I paid for her to go to college.

1530
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,490
我给她出钱还债
I paid off her debts.

1531
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:13,390
你看到过她注射海洛因吗
Did you ever see any heroin use?

1532
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:15,590
不  不可能  她吗
No. No way, her?

1533
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:16,930
不  她没碰过
No, she didn't touch it.

1534
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,630
该死
Shit.

1535
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:22,100
她从来不让我画她的脸  除了这一张
She never let me paint her face except for this one.

1536
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,130
我从没有见过长得如此美丽
I've never seen such a beautiful girl

1537
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,770
却那么想要隐匿在人群中
wanna be so invisible

1538
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:29,040
或者完全消失的女孩
or just completely vanish.

1539
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,570
但是你知道吗  要消失
But you know what, it takes

1540
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:32,080
是需要钱的
money to vanish.

1541
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,510
所以她带走了从我身上搜刮的所有东西
And so she took everything that she could from me.

1542
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,080
你知道我会把你画成什么样吗
You know how I would paint you?

1543
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,690
天使般
Beatific.

1544
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:45,060
就像一个该死的圣人
Like a fucking saint.

1545
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:47,090
经常有人这么说
I get that a lot.

1546
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,430
那你应该接受  人们都爱圣人
You should embrace it. People love saints.

1547
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:53,630
是啊  在他们死后
Yeah. After they're dead.

1548
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,730
你对她有多少了解  她怎么死的
Okay. What do you know about her? How did she die?

1549
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:58,800
死在湖里
In a lake.

1550
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,010
注射了海洛因
On heroin.

1551
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:06,710
你不相信  不然你也不会来了
Well, you don't believe that or you wouldn't be here.

1552
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:09,450
她从来没有提到过密歇根  对吗
She didn't ever mention Michigan, did she?

1553
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,820
这是她留在这的唯一一件东西
That is the only thing that she ever left here.

1554
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:21,990
她说这是她从小就带在身边的
She said she had it since she was a kid.

1555
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:25,980
斯阔湖
圣经夏令营

1556
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:25,990
我警告你
I warn you,

1557
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,960
你要是要去打探她的过去
you go poking around in her past,

1558
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:30,830
你会发现一些很可怕的事
you're gonna find some shit that is terrifying.

1559
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,610
她不是一个像你我这样的普通人
She was not a normal person like you or me.

1560
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:35,940
肖恩  我是斯蒂芬妮
Sean, it's Stephanie...

1561
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,740
我考虑了一下你说的话
I thought about what you said.

1562
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,610
你说得对  这些只是悲伤的阶段
You're right. These are just stages of grief.

1563
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:42,950
我们俩的压力都太大了
This experience has been so stressful for both of us,

1564
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:44,550
我准备自己一个人离开几天去散散心
I'm gonna take a couple of days to myself.

1565
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:45,910
我会让索娜帮忙接送孩子们
I'll have Sona pick up the boys,

1566
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,180
他们今晚就住在她那儿了
and they can stay at her house tonight.

1567
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:49,120
你应该也好好去散个心
You should take some time, too.

1568
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:50,970
斯阔湖
圣经夏令营

1569
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,550
冰箱里有火腿炖菜
There's ham stew in the freezer.

1570
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:51,720
在微波炉里转五分钟就行
Five minutes in the microwave.

1571
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:52,730
爱你
Lots of love.

1572
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,830
我们五十年来一直在
Yeah, we've been saving young souls

1573
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,530
拯救年轻的灵魂
going on 50 years now.

1574
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:00,160
不仅仅只有我和鲍比
Not Bobby and me personally.

1575
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:02,030
看起来真是太棒了
Well, it seems just perfect!

1576
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,630
我儿子几乎是个小海豚
And my son's practically a porpoise,

1577
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,800
他肯定很喜欢在湖里游泳的
so I know he's gonna love swimming in that pond.

1578
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,900
那是斯阔湖
That's Squaw Lake!

1579
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,710
孩子们总打趣说这都是圣水
The kids all joke that it's holy water.

1580
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:11,140
你钓上来的每条鱼
Any fish you pull out of there

1581
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:12,710
都能喂饱一大群人
is guaranteed to feed a multitude.

1582
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:14,580
太好笑了
Oh! Oh. That's so funny.

1583
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:19,550
你们有没有什么旧相册
Um... Have you guys got any old photo albums

1584
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:21,650
或者年鉴能给我看看
or a yearbook I could look at?

1585
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:23,150
我总觉得营员的面貌
I always feel like there's no better review

1586
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:25,050
才能体现出整个地方的面貌
of a place than the faces of the campers.

1587
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,560
当然了  我们地下室有一大堆呢
Oh, heck, yeah. We got a ton of 'em down in the basement.

1588
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,890
你只会看到一大堆笑脸
You'll see nothing but smiles.

1589
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:49,110
双人独木舟第一
霍普[希望]·麦克兰登和菲斯[信心]·麦克兰登

1590
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:52,530

霍普·麦克兰登
最佳扔蛋组合
霍普·麦克兰登和菲斯·麦克兰登

希望[霍普]和信心[菲斯]
Hope and Faith.

1592
01:13:56,740 --> 01:14:00,120
斯阔湖圣经夏令营地谢谢麦克兰登家族的慷慨捐助

1593
01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:00,720
我找麦克兰登基金会
Hi. I'm looking for the McLanden Foundation.

1594
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,580
汽车旅馆

1595
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,730
请问你是玛格丽特·麦克兰登吗
Is this Margaret McLanden?

1596
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:04,040
玛格丽特·麦克兰登

1597
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:03,930
你是谁
Who's this?

1598
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:07,060
你好  我是玛丽安·切尔科夫斯基
Yeah. Hi, there. My name's Maryanne Chelkowsky.

1599
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:09,630
我是斯阔湖圣经夏令营地的主管
I'm the director of the Squaw Lake Bible Camp.

1600
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:10,670
你想要什么
What do you want?

1601
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:13,340
我们在修订纪念五十周年的
Well, we are putting together the 50th anniversary

1602
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:14,940
营地公报
edition of our camp gazette.

1603
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,910
我们想要跟踪报道一些明星学院
We're trying to track down some star alumni.

1604
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:20,280
请问你认识霍普和菲斯·麦克兰登姐妹吗
Are you any relation to Hope and Faith McLanden?

1605
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,610
-喂  -布鲁斯  又是那个营地
- Hello. - Bruce, it's that camp.

1606
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:24,980
那些女孩肯定又干了些什么  上帝...
The girls must have done something again and God...

1607
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,250
女孩们早就不在了  麦太太
Girls are long gone, Mrs. M.

1608
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,320
请你坐会你的凳子上去
You just go on back to your chair.

1609
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,990
但是这里好脏  布鲁斯
But it's filthy there, Bruce.

1610
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:30,090
我跟你说了...
I've asked you a...

1611
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,560
找到了
Gotcha.

1612
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:16,230
慢慢来  布鲁斯
Take your time, Bruce.

1613
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:39,860
麦克兰登太太
Mrs. McLanden?

1614
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:43,630
我是清洁公司的格洛丽亚
Hi, I'm Gloria from the cleaning service.

1615
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,090
谁
Who?

1616
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:45,990
布鲁斯没有告诉你吗
Didn't Bruce tell you?

1617
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,300
我要把这里清扫干净
I'm supposed to clean the entire place

1618
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,360
让你可以坐在地板上
until you could eat

1619
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:50,300
享受四菜大餐
a four-course meal off the floor.

1620
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,730
我没记错日期...
Did I get the date...

1621
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:53,240
该死
Shoot!

1622
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,640
从我楼上的厕所开始
Start in my upstairs bathroom.

1623
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:06,350
如果我真的在清扫  就不算是撒谎
It's not lying if I'm actually cleaning.

1624
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,230
布鲁斯
Bruce!

1625
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,640
火要灭了
The fire's dying!

1626
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:29,310
布鲁斯
Bruce!

1627
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:45,890
我注意到了
I couldn't help noticing that

1628
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:47,430
你女儿们可爱的照片
lovely picture of your daughters.

1629
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:51,190
布鲁斯在哪里
Where's Bruce?

1630
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,430
布鲁斯
Bruce!

1631
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:54,730
布鲁斯出去了...
Bruce had to go out. Um...

1632
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,270
那么
So,

1633
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,500
你的女儿  菲斯
your daughter, Faith...

1634
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,100
她应该是惹了些麻烦吧
She had some trouble, I gather?

1635
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,270
麻烦
Troubles!

1636
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:05,040
麻烦都算是轻的
Troubles would've been a vacation.

1637
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,380
那孩子简直是来自地狱
That child came straight from hell.

1638
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:12,210
一个妈妈用这种说辞也太重了
That's a very strong statement for a mother.

1639
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,780
你也是一名母亲吗
Are you a mother?

1640
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:17,220
是的  我喜欢当母亲的每一分钟
Yes. I love every minute of it.

1641
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:20,220
那你肯定是脑子坏了
Then you must have brain damage.

1642
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,920
这是吃力不讨好的活
It's a thankless business.

1643
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:26,060
有的孩子生下来就是坏的
And some children are just born rotten.

1644
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:29,300
他们不需要父母  而是需要驱魔人
They don't need a parent. They need an exorcist.

1645
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,400
我的丈夫非常明白
My husband understood that.

1646
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:35,540
等等  别告诉布鲁斯
Now, wait. Don't tell Bruce!

1647
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,510
-不会的  -找到了
- No. - Bingo!

1648
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:40,350
这家伙对我的管束也太不人道了
It's unseemly, the way that man polices me.

1649
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:42,540
你要来点雪莉酒吗
Would you like some sherry?

1650
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:44,480
不用了  谢谢  你真好
Oh, no, thank you. You're very sweet.

1651
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,780
等等  这
Wait, that's...

1652
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:49,520
这不是雪莉酒  这是琴酒
That's not sherry. That's the gin.

1653
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,850
雪莉酒呢

1655

一切  一切

1657

我们为她的戒瘾花了好多钱

霍普想要照顾她

1659

没错
Yes.

你可以和我透露一些的
You could've told me something.

1789
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:52,180
然而你无法保守秘密  就算你现在什么都不知道
Except you can't keep a secret, even in the dark.

1790
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:54,520
-什么都行  -你几乎毁了一切
- Anything. - You almost ruined everything.

1791
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:59,120
我必须保持低调  等保险金打过来
I had to lay low until the insurance money came through.

1792
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,890
那你现在怎么不低调了呢
And so why didn't you stay low? Hmm?

1793
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:04,290
然而你吓到了我们的孩子
Instead, you terrorized our son.

1794
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,260
我没有吓他
I didn't terrorize him.

1795
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:06,660
你让我以为他和斯蒂芬妮一样
You made me think that he had gone insane

1796
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,530
全都疯了
as well as Stephanie.

1797
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:10,430
我太想他了
I missed him too much.

1798
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:11,700
他是我的小宝贝
He's my little dude.

1799
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,370
你知道我有多爱他
You know how much I love that kid.

1800
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:18,240
现在时间不多了
Well, the clock is ticking now.

1801
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,440
神探南茜知道得太多了
Nancy Drew knows too much.

1802
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,410
如果她让我的保险金黄了
If she fucks up my insurance money coming through,

1803
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:23,880
我就要拖你一起下水
I'm taking you down with me.

1804
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,480
你要拖我一起下水
You're taking me down with you?

1805
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,920
当然了  这都是你的计划
Well, of course, this was all your plan.

1806
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,350
我的计划
My plan?

1807
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:29,720
我跟这些完全没关系...
I had nothing to do with it...

1808
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,920
你现在为什么要装傻
Why are you playing dumb now?

1809
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,590
你这个该死的疯子
...you twisted fucking psycho.

1810
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:33,760
我不知道你从哪里...
I don't know where...

1811
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:38,460
你刚刚说我什么该死的疯子来着
What were you saying about me being a fucking psycho?

1812
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,330
你爱她吗
Do you love her?

1813
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:43,500
不  只是性
No. It was just sex.

1814
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,270
你上她的时候想的是我吗
Did you think of me when you were fucking her?

1815
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,540
是的
Yes.

1816
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:51,970
你爱不爱我  宝贝
Do you love me or not, baby?

1817
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:53,680
我当然爱你
Of course I do.

1818
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:55,440
她对我来说没有意义
She doesn't mean a thing to me.

1819
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:56,680
很好
Good.

1820
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:00,620
该死  该死
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1821
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:01,820
我忘记上膛了
I forgot to load it.

1822
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:03,490
操  天啊
Fuck. Oh, God.

1823
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:05,590
你敢想象万一我上膛了会怎样吗
Can you imagine if I would've, though?

1824
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:06,750
真操蛋
What a mess.

1825
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:08,590
艾米丽  你疯了
Emily, you're crazy.

1826
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:10,930
其实很简单
Hey, it's pretty simple. You know?

1827
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:12,830
你来选择  她还是我
It's your choice. Her or me?

1828
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:14,900
没那么难
It's not that hard.

1829
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,740
别难了
Stop it.

1830
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,870
你很喜欢
You love this.

1831
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:24,240
20秒后到厕所找我
Meet me in the bathroom in 20 seconds.

1832
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:27,510
敲两次门
Knock twice.

1833
01:25:41,290 --> 01:25:42,360
他来了
There he is now.

1834
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,190
汤森德先生
Mr. Townsend,

1835
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:45,730
我是艾迪森第一保险的伊莎贝尔·普丽吉
Isabel Prager, Addison First Insurance.

1836
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:47,430
我正在调查你已故的妻子
I'm investigating the death benefit claim

1837
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:48,700
保险金赔偿事宜
for your late wife.

1838
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:53,310
肖恩
Sean,

1839
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:56,410
你知道艾米丽有一个双胞胎姐妹吗
did you know that Emily had a twin?

1840
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,580
不知道  但是...
No, but...

1841
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:02,380
我也不想这么说
Well, I hate to even say this,

1842
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:03,850
但这说明湖中的尸体
but it means the body in the lake

1843
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:05,780
很可能是她的姐姐
could be this sister.

1844
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:07,480
这样就能解释得通DNA检测了
It could explain the DNA match.

1845
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,580
如果是那样的话
And if that's the case,

1846
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:10,820
艾米丽现在在哪里
then where is Emily?

1847
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:18,060
如果我的妻子还活着  她肯定会回家的
If my wife was still alive, she'd come home.

1848
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:19,260
她肯定想要见她儿子
She'd wanna see her son.

1849
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,070
我不是警察
I'm not a cop,

1850
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:24,900
我绝对也不是心理治疗师
and I'm definitely no therapist,

1851
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,400
我只是一个保险业务员
I'm just an insurance guy.

1852
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:30,440
但是这事实在是太有意思了
But this is an incredibly interesting case.

1853
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,670
就是这么简单  对吗
This is just bananas, isn't it?

1854
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:34,510
-没错  -我要说
- Yeah. - I will say,

1855
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:35,910
作为丈夫
it's unusual

1856
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:37,710
或者妻子  很少会不知道
to live with someone as husband and wife

1857
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:38,980
自己的枕边人有个双胞胎兄弟或姐妹
and not know that they have a twin.

1858
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:40,950
她很注重个人隐私
She was a very private person.

1859
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:44,050
我们都有自己的秘密
Well, hey, we all have our secrets.

1860
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:47,860
但我相信你肯定能理解
But, as I'm sure you can understand,

1861
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:49,390
如此大额的赔偿
with a payment of this size,

1862
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:51,460
我们需要继续对此进行调查
we'll have to continue this claims investigation.

1863
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:52,560
当然了
Of course.

1864
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,660
并且根据法律  将我们调查所得结果
And, by law, give all our findings

1865
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:55,860
都呈交给当局
to the authorities.

1866
01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:57,630
当然了  只要你有需要
Of course, anything you need.

1867
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:59,770
我只希望我的妻子还活着
I just hope that my wife is still alive.

1868
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:00,770
我想要她回来
I want her back.

1869
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:06,580
那好的
Okey-dokey, then.

1870
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:08,580
显然  如果你有她的消息
Obviously, if you do hear from her...

1871
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:10,350
-绝对第一个通知你  -非常感谢你
- You'll be the first to know. - Thank you so much!

1872
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,380
谢谢你  谢谢你的咖啡
Okay, thank you. Thanks for the coffee.

1873
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:14,920
再见
Bye-bye.

1874
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:15,920
-再次非常感谢  -谢谢
- Thank you so much again. - Thanks.

1875
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,890
你早就知道她有个双胞胎姐妹吗
You knew that she had a twin.

1876
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:20,090
我知道吗
Did I?

1877
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:21,820
你为什么不知道
Why didn't you?

1878
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:23,090
你知道  而你没告诉我
You knew and you didn't tell me.

1879
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:24,300
肖恩
Sean,

1880
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:26,560
你听上去像是疯了
you sound crazy.

1881
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,330
来一片阿普唑仓
Take a Xanax.

1882
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,800
来两片吧
Take two.

1883
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,670
妈妈们  我是斯蒂芬妮
Hi, moms. Stephanie here.

1884
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:40,560
完美墓穴

1885
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:36,110
今天  我们要来聊聊摆在墓前的贡品
Today, we're talking about tombstone tributes.

1886
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:37,710
我要感谢来自蒙大纳米苏拉的海伦
I want to thank Helen from Missoula, Montana,

1887
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:38,840
所提的建议
for the suggestions.

1888
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:41,010
非常创新
For thinking outside the box.

1889
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:44,610
现在不需要送花了
You know, it doesn't have to just be flowers anymore.

1890
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:48,110
纪念艾米丽·尼尔森
挚爱的母亲  妻子和朋友
1986年11月6日-2017年9月26日

1891
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:50,020
我觉得能唤起美好回忆的东西都行
I think any item that sparks a fond memory is perfect.

1892
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:52,690
艾米丽最喜欢在午后来一杯
Emily's favorite treat was a dry gin martini

1893
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:53,960
干琴酒马丁尼
in the late afternoon.

1894
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,960
我要像艾米丽一样调几杯
I'm gonna make a couple just like Emily used to.

1895
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,590

I'm gonna head out there a little later today.

1898
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:06,000
在她目前敬一杯
Have a toast on her grave.

1899
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,540
挤了很大一块  我教得不错
Nice, big twist. I taught you well.

1900
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,880
名师出高徒
Student's become the master.

1901
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:17,580
聪明
Ooh, wisdom.

01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,850
给我
Hey, give me that.

1903
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:22,420
我不知道你的新袖子里
I don't know what tricks you have

1904
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:24,520
藏了什么小把戏
up those new sleeves of yours.

1905
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,160
你觉得我在两杯里都下毒了吗
You think I poisoned both drinks?

1906
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:27,490
这不是我的风格
That's not my style.

1907
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,760
我连粗粮都不吃
I don't even eat gluten.

1908
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,500
-要再来一杯吗  -好啊
- Want another? - Please.

1909
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,170
首先  告诉我为什么
First, tell me why

1910
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:38,830
你杀死了你的父亲和你的姐妹
you killed your father and sister.

1911
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:40,440
好吧  我们不如先来谈谈
Okay, why don't we first talk about

1912
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,800
你儿子的生父
your son's real father?

1913
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:44,610
艾米丽  现在主动权都在我手上
Oh! Emily, I hold all the cards here.

1914
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:46,070
我想知道你的双胞胎姐妹  菲斯
I wanna know about your twin, Faith.

1915
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,210
我不是双胞胎
I'm not a twin.

1916
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:49,040
太棒了  我知道你是
Great, I know that you are.

1917
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:50,710
我们是三胞胎
We were triplets.

1918
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:52,980
菲斯  霍普和查丽蒂[善举]  查丽蒂夭折了
Faith, Hope, and Charity. Charity was stillborn.

1919
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:54,080
我们的妈妈觉得我们在腹中
Mom thought we offed her

1920
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,150
杀死了她
in the womb.

1921
01:28:55,150 --> 01:28:57,080
爸爸相信了她
Dad believed her.

1922
01:28:57,090 --> 01:28:58,990
你妈妈是个人物
She's quite a woman, your mother.

1923
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,760
我和麦克聊得很开心
I had a nice afternoon with Mags.

1924
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,620
你去见了我妈妈
You met my mother?

1925
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:05,730
她喜欢的马丁尼比你喜欢的还要烈
She likes her martinis even stronger than yours.

1926
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:08,460
我们回忆了一下过去
We had a little walk down memory lane.

1927
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:10,200
她是个冷酷的女人  艾米
She's a cold woman, Em.

1928
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:13,100
在她眼里  你肯定做什么都是错的
Bet you couldn't do anything right in her eyes.

1929
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:15,470
也许放火是菲斯的主意
It was probably Faith's idea to set the fire.

1930
01:29:15,470 --> 01:29:17,140
不过话说回来  坏主意都是菲斯出的  对吗
But then, all the bad ideas were Faith's, weren't they?

1931
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:19,170
-你什么都不知道  -我当然知道
- You don't know anything. - Sure I do.

1932
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:20,810
我懂
And I get it.

1933
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:22,680
你16岁
You're 16.

1934
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,180
正是你感觉遭到束缚的年纪
It's that age where you feel so trapped.

1935
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:29,520
然后如果你妈妈总是责骂你...
Then, if your mother always had the biting comment...

1936
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:37,890
-菲斯  行了  走  -爸爸  爸爸
- Faith, it's over. Let's go! - Dad! Dad!

1937
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:40,130
-爸爸  别碰我  -这不是我的错
- Dad! Don't touch me! - It's not my fault!

1938
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:42,230
我想你爸爸表现得应该更直接
...I'm guessing your father was more direct.

1939
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:44,170
妓女
Whore!

1940
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:46,240
-没有下次  -住手
- Never again! - Stop!

1941
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,010
于是你和菲斯开始学会按下重置键  对吧
That's when you and Faith learned to hit the reset button, right?

1942
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,010
燃烧吧  宝贝  燃烧吧
Burn, baby, burn.

1943
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:01,850
你们为什么分开了
Why'd you leave each other?

1944
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:04,920
大火后  我们俩不能待在一起
Well, we couldn't stay together after the fire.

1945
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,950
警察们都在找纵火金发双胞胎
The cops were looking for the big blonde arson twins.

1946
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,660
我们简直是行走的标志牌
We were a walking sideshow.

1947
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:12,090
滚开
Fuck off!

1948
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:14,760
我们必须告别  所以我们纹了纹身
We had to say goodbye, so we did it with tattoos.

1949
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:17,700
火焰  以及一点点关于查丽蒂的图案
Flames, and a little something for Charity.

1950
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:24,640
我们是在圣体节分开的
We split up in Corpus Christi.

1951
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,770
她要往南去墨西哥
She was gonna head south to Mexico,

1952
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:27,740
我要往北
I was gonna go north.

1953
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:28,910
我们定了等尘埃落定后
We set a time and place to meet

1954
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:30,710
重聚的时间和地点
after the smoke cleared.

1955
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:34,320
但是  她却再也没有出现
But then, she never showed up.

1956
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,750
我非常担心  等了好几天
I was worried sick. I waited for days.

1957
01:30:37,550 --> 01:30:39,050
但是却杳无音信
But nothing.

1958
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,620
我觉得也许这是我
I thought maybe this is my opportunity

1959
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:41,760
独立的机会了
to do it on my own.

1960
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,060
她总是会给我惹上麻烦
She was always getting me into trouble.

1961
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:44,230
于是我买了来纽约的单程票
So I bought a one-way ticket to New York

1962
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,630
再也没有回头
and never looked back.

1963
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:46,730
你想她吗
Did you miss her?

1964
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:47,800
我当然想她了
Of course I missed her.

1965
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,300
没有她  我是不完整的
I wasn't whole without her.

1966
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:51,200
但我不能再那样下去  我要生存
But I couldn't go on like that, I had to survive.

1967
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:52,100
我成功了
And it worked.

1968
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:54,240
我在纽约的生活慢慢好了起来
Yeah, my life in New York fell into place.

1969
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:57,070
我有了工作  努力往上爬
I got a job, worked my way up.

1970
01:30:57,070 --> 01:30:58,810
遇到了完美的另一半
I met the perfect man.

1971
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:01,640
这部分你已经了解了
Oh, you know that part, though.

1972
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,080
然后你的姐姐打来了电话
Then your sister calls.

1973
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,310
该死的脸书
Fucking Facebook.

1974
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:06,650
-你必须去见她  -我当然得去了
- You had to see her. - Yeah, of course I did.

1975
01:31:06,650 --> 01:31:09,850
于是你捏造了去迈阿密的出差
So you fabricate this trip to Miami,

1976
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:11,150
在旧营地见了面
meet up at the old camp.

1977
01:31:11,150 --> 01:31:13,060
四号营房  我们的快乐时光在那里度过
Camp bunk four, it was our happy place.

1978
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:18,130
只有在那里才能真正地逃离我们的爸爸
It was the only place we could escape our dad, really.

1979
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,340
这么多年后再见到她
Must've been shocking

1980
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:30,110
肯定很惊讶吧
to see her after all those years.

1981
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,740
是啊  就像在照镜子
Yeah, it was like looking in the mirror.

1982
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:37,240
只不过她选择了和我截然不同的病态道路
Except at the sick life she chose over me.

1983
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:38,850
她想要什么
What did she want?

1984
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:39,850
一切
Everything.

1985
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:43,750
你打算就这么干站着吗
Just gonna stand there?

1986
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:46,290
你必须要有信心
You gotta have Faith.

1987
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:48,690
我14年来没有你的消息
I don't hear from you for 14 years,

1988
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:50,390
然后你就这么突然出现了
and now, here you are?

1989
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:51,860
我没有钱了
I'm out of cash.

1990
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:52,860
震惊
Shocking.

1991
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,870
你他妈说什么
The fuck did you say?

1992
01:31:58,770 --> 01:31:59,830
没什么
Nothing.

1993
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,770
这次放过你
Get away with it this time.

1994
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:03,240
好吧  那...
Okay, so, um...

1995
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,810
-你现在怎么办  -我不知道
- Now what? - I don't know.

1996
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:06,070
我不知道该去哪里
I didn't know where to go.

1997
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,080
我打电话时  你听起来很陌生
When I call, you act like a stranger.

1998
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,950
都不想让我来见见你的家人
Won't even let me come meet your family.

1999
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:11,810
我要怎么和他们说
What am I supposed to say to them?

2000
01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:12,820
真相吗
The truth?

2001
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:15,680
你最好赶紧和他们说
Well, you may as well now

2002
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:17,790
因为我要告诉警察了
because I'm about to tell the cops.

2003
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:18,890
什么
You're what?

2004
01:32:18,890 --> 01:32:21,290
我不知道该怎么办了
I don't know what else to do.

2005
01:32:21,290 --> 01:32:22,920
我什么都没有
I don't have anything,

2006
01:32:22,930 --> 01:32:25,060
所以我没有什么好失去的了
so I don't really have anything to lose.

2007
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:26,930
我要告诉他们我们所做的一切
I'm gonna go tell them everything we did.

2008
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:28,800
然后我们就一起完蛋
And then we'll go down together.

2009
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,930
我们就能重新在一起了
We can be together again.

2010
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:31,730
我现在有一个儿子了
I have a little boy now.

2011
01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:34,370
我知道  我看到那孩子了  真可爱
Yeah, I know. I saw that kid. He's super cute.

2012
01:32:34,370 --> 01:32:35,900
少废话了
Cut the shit, okay?

2013
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:37,310
你想要我给你什么
What do you want from me?

2014
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:40,740
我要一百万
I want a million bucks.

2015
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,010
我要怎么给你一百万
How am I supposed to give you that?

2016
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:43,240
你现在有钱有名
You're rich and famous now.

2017
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:45,020
我给不了你一百万
I can't give you a million dollars.

2018
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,850
你看上去倒是很有动力
You do seem highly motivated.

2019
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:49,750
我倒是不知道为什么
I don't know what it is, though.

2020
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:50,920
可能是你的工作
It's your job,

2021
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,850
也可能是你的孩子
probably your kid.

2022
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,820
别提尼基
Don't talk about Nicky.

2023
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:57,290
嗯  我...
Yeah, I'll, um...

2024
01:32:57,290 --> 01:33:00,760
我会卖掉房子  我会尽我所能
I'll sell the house. I'll do whatever I need to do.

2025
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,160
如果我给了你  你不许告诉任何人
If I do this, you can't tell anyone ever.

2026
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:03,170
你明白吗
Do you understand?

2027
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:05,870
嗯  我明白
Yeah, I get it.

2028
01:33:05,870 --> 01:33:07,900
我其实不明白孩子们有什么大不了的
I mean, I don't really get the big deal about kids.

2029
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:10,340
你永远可以再生一个嘛
You could always just make another kid.

2030
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:12,710
你知道的  对吧
You know that, right?

2031
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:14,080
但是姐姐只有一个
You can't make another sister, though.

2032
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:17,750
这里真热
It's fucking hot.

2033
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:19,880
走吧  我们去游泳
Come on, let's go swimming.

2034
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,650
记得吗  像我们以前经常做的那样
Remember? Like we used to.

2035
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,850
-你来吗  -嗯
- You coming? - Yeah.

2036
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:26,090
马上来
Right behind you.

2037
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,270
你怎么在湖里淹死她的
How'd you get her in the lake?

2038
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:39,940
去你妈的  我没有杀死我姐姐
Fuck you. I didn't kill my sister.

2039
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:40,970
那都是她的主意
That was her idea.

2040
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:50,420
来啊  胆小鬼
Come on, wimp.

2041
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,520
怎么了  我以为你现在应该比我厉害了呢
What? I thought you were the alpha now.

2042
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:55,780
不是吗
No?

2043
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:57,420
我就是比你厉害  该死
I am the alpha, God damn it.

2044
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:17,200
你抛弃了我
You abandoned me.

2045
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:19,440
你和我应该是一队的
We were supposed to be a team, you and me.

2046
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,540
记得吗
Remember?

2047
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,010
我知道
Yeah, I know we were.

2048
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:25,880
但是我觉得当时我们唯一的选择就是分开
But I just thought the only chance we had was alone.

2049
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:28,220
你说得对
You were right.

2050
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:30,490
对不起  孩子
I'm sorry, kid.

2051
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,160
我也是
Me, too.

2052
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:33,580
我太担心了
I was so worried.

2053
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:36,790
我第二天早上醒来  哪里都找不到她
I woke up the next morning. I couldn't find her anywhere.

2054
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:39,860
我从来没想到
I never thought...

2055
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:43,430
我从来没想到她会这么做
I never thought she'd do that, you know?

2056
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:49,200
我在湖里找到她的尸体后  已经太迟了
When I found her body in the lake, it was too late.

2057
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,370
撒谎
Lie.

2058
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:51,430
你溺死了她
You drowned her.

2059
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:53,470
不  她杀死了自己
No, she killed herself.

2060
01:35:53,470 --> 01:35:55,100
她只留下了我
I'm just all that's left of her.

2061
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:56,540
不  你是个杀姐姐的人
No, you're a sister killer.

2062
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:58,040
你是干哥哥的
You're a brotherfucker.

2063
01:35:59,310 --> 01:36:00,880
肖恩知道多少
What does Sean know?

2064
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:01,980
全知道
Everything.

2065
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,150
这是他的主意
It was his idea.

2066
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:06,010
我找到尸体后不知道该怎么办
I didn't know what to do once I found the body.

2067
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:08,320
他说这可能是我们的机会
He said maybe this is our opportunity.

2068
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,050
我们终于能还清债了
We could finally get out of debt.

2069
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:11,120
离开这个国家
Flee the country.

2070
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:13,520
多陪陪尼基
Spend more time with Nicky.

2071
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,290
他说服我我们得演一场戏
He convinced me we could pull it off.

2072
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:17,160
其他就交给她的DNA
That her DNA would do the rest.

2073
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:19,430
我不相信你  他为你的死而悲伤
I don't believe you. He grieved for you.

2074
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:20,930
你信这一套吗
Oh, you believed that?

2075
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:22,400
那全都是演戏
Aw, that was all an act.

2076
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,100
你真是个病态的骗子
You're a pathological liar.

2077
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:25,400
这是肖恩说的吗
Did Sean say that?

2078
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,340
不错
Cool.

2079
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,540
我快速给你放一遍吧
I'm just gonna play you this tune real quick.

2080
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:37,450
-你爱她吗  -不
- Do you love her? - No.

2081
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:38,780
只是性
It was just sex.

2082
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:41,150
你上她的时候想的是我吗
Did you think of me when you were fucking her?

2083
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:43,450
是的
Yes.

2084
01:36:43,450 --> 01:36:45,190
你爱不爱我  宝贝
Do you love me or not, baby?

2085
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:46,990
我当然爱你
Of course I do.

2086
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:48,960
她对我来说没有意义
She doesn't mean a thing to me.

2087
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,390
对不起  宝贝  我知道你以为那都是真的
I'm sorry, baby. I know you thought it was real.

2088
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:55,300
但是  往好处看
But, hey, look on the bright side.

2089
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:57,500
你的主页因为我而大火
Your website went viral, thanks to me.

2090
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,500
这一切都是为了一点钱吗
All this for a little money?

2091
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:02,700
四百万
A little $4 million.

2092
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:05,470
不算是一点吧
That's not exactly little, huh?

2093
01:37:05,470 --> 01:37:07,370
我本来是要躲到这笔钱到手
I was hiding out till that money came in.

2094
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,280
他会处理好所有后续的事
He was just gonna tie up some loose ends.

2095
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,980
我算是后续的事吗
Was I a loose end?

2096
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:12,610
他需要有人帮忙照顾尼基
Well, he needed help with Nicky.

2097
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:14,420
你和孩子们关系都那么好
You're so good with those kids.

2098
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:16,690
那现在怎么办
So what happens now?

2099
01:37:16,690 --> 01:37:19,150
我只想要我的孩子
I just want my kid.

2100
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,660
你搞砸了我的骗保计划
You fucked up my insurance plan.

2101
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:22,520
那些官员绝对会咬着不放
The authorities won't back down on that.

2102
01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:23,620
肖恩可以给你  他就是个混蛋
You can have Sean. He's a piece of shit.

2103
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:24,960
我甚至都不想要他
I don't even want him.

2104
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,460
我不想要肖恩
I don't want Sean.

2105
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,930
那我就不知道了  我猜...
Then I don't know, I guess there's...

2106
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:30,940
还有另一个办法  不错
There's another way, but

2107
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:34,030
只能算是母亲与母亲之间的交涉
sort of one mother to another.

2108
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:40,410
睡得像头猪
Sleeping like a log.

2109
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:45,920
汤森德  邮箱

2110
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:10,170
发生了什么
What's going on?

2111
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:12,310
他们有搜查令  我想给你打电话的
They have a warrant. I tried to call you.

2112
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:15,210
不好意思  我是汤森德
Excuse me. I'm Sean Townsend.

2113
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:17,010
你有任何需要我都可以进行合作
Look, I'm happy to comply with anything you need.

2114
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:19,350
但是最好还是能事先知会我一下吧
But it would be nice to have a heads-up.

2115
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:20,750
这是公开调查
This is an open investigation.

2116
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:23,050
不需要等你有空的时候再通知我们
You don't get to pencil us in when it's convenient.

2117
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,560
我被捕了吗
Am I under arrest?

2118
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:36,130
不  还没有  地检想要板上钉钉
Oh, no, not yet. The DA wants a slam dunk.

2119
01:38:36,130 --> 01:38:38,270
由于我什么都没干  那可能还是有点难度的
That's gonna be pretty hard since I haven't done anything.

2120
01:38:38,270 --> 01:38:39,500
你知道你妻子还活着吗
Did you know your wife was alive?

2121
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,640
最近才知道
Not until recently.

2122
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:43,200
什么时候
When?

2123
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:44,540
她联系了我
She contacted me.

2124
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:47,310
你立刻通知了当局吧
And you immediately notified the authorities, right?

2125
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:49,180
没有我的律师在场  我不能和你讨论这些
I can't discuss this without my attorney.

2126
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:51,250
你可真是一名好教授啊
You know what? You really are a professor, aren't you?

2127
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:53,080
回头聊
Okay, we'll talk soon.

2128
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:55,250
如果我们需要联系你
Oh, uh, if we need to contact you,

2129
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:57,320
你会和你妻子一起还是和她的好朋友一起
will you be with your wife or the best friend?

2130
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,660
还是别人
Somebody else?

2131
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:12,100
我需要一杯烈酒  也许你的...
I need a stiff drink. Maybe some of your...

2132
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:14,300
抱歉  你不能进来
I'm sorry. You can't come in.

2133
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:16,470
什么  尼基在哪里
What? Where's Nicky?

2134
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:17,840
他在楼上玩
He's upstairs playing.

2135
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,170
-你需要离开这里  -你在说什么
- You have to go. - What are you talking about?

2136
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:22,140
这里正在进行调查  肖恩
This is an ongoing investigation, Sean.

2137
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:23,310
我的天啊
For fuck's sake.

2138
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:24,380
我不能让你进房子
I can't let you into this house

2139
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:25,650
除非一切全部解决了
until this whole thing's been solved.

2140
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:26,850
她蛊惑了你  对吗
She's gotten to you, hasn't she?

2141
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:28,320
这和艾米丽没有关系
This has nothing to do with Emily.

2142
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,850
这跟她大有关系
It's got everything to do with her.

2143
01:39:30,850 --> 01:39:32,450
她在撺掇你
She's gaslighting you.

2144
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:34,390
你不明白她有多么强大
You don't understand how powerful she is.

2145
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:36,590
不  我现在什么都不明白了
No, I don't understand anything right now.

2146
01:39:36,590 --> 01:39:38,130
斯蒂芬妮  别这么做
Stephanie, don't do this.

2147
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:40,060
请不要逼我报警
Please don't make me call the police.

2148
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:21,240
斯蒂芬妮  给我回电
Stephanie, please call me back.

2149
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,570
我不知道怎么回事
I don't know what's going on

2150
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:24,740
也不知道这会变成什么样
or how this is all going to turn out.

2151
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:26,410
但你是个好妈妈
But you're a great mum,

2152
01:40:26,410 --> 01:40:28,810
你教我怎么做一个更好的爸爸
and you taught me how to be a better dad.

2153
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:31,710
我将永远感激你
For that, I'll always be grateful.

2154
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:36,220
事实上  我不觉得我了解我的妻子
The truth is, I don't think I ever knew my wife.

2155
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:38,120
或者了解她的能耐
Or what she's capable of.

2156
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:14,660
艾米丽·尼尔森的案子
A shocking new development

2157
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:15,960
出现了令人震惊的新进展
in the Emily Nelson case,

2158
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:19,390
本案因为其在网上的疯狂传播而广为人知
which first went viral on a popular Internet vlog.

2159
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,460
原本被认定为已在密歇根州死亡的
The PR executive who was believed dead

2160
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:22,860
公关部长重新露面
in Michigan has resurfaced.

2161
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:24,930
湖中找到的尸体
And it appears the body found in the lake

2162
01:41:24,930 --> 01:41:27,270
是尼尔森多年未见的双胞胎姐姐
was that of Nelson's estranged twin sister.

2163
01:41:27,270 --> 01:41:29,470
尼尔森的丈夫  肖恩·汤森德
Nelson's husband, Sean Townsend,

2164
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:31,870
是一名失败的小说家  也是一名英语教授
an abusive failed novelist and English professor

2165
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:34,910
据称他逼迫她伪造了自己的死亡
allegedly forced her to stage her own death

2166
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:35,880
为了
in order to collect

2167
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,910
四百万的人生保险金
a $4 million life insurance policy.

2168
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:39,050
不管怎么样
Nevertheless,

2169
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:41,680
汤森德先生的保释会将于今天召开
bail for Mr. Townsend will be set today.

2170
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:42,850
作为英国公民
A British national,

2171
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:44,820
汤森德如果被判有罪将会面临遣返
Townsend faces deportation if found guilty.

2172
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:46,750
虽然尼尔森女士也参与了欺诈
Although an accomplice to fraud,

2173
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,920
但是她正在积极与警方合作
Ms. Nelson is complying with the authorities

2174
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:50,560
以争取宽大处理
in exchange for clemency.

2175
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:54,800
斯蒂芬妮
Stephanie?

2176
01:41:58,730 --> 01:42:00,330
尼基在哪里
Where's Nicky?

2177
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:02,410
他在朋友家看电影呢
Oh, he's at a friend's house watching a movie.

2178
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:05,910
我觉得我们需要点二人甜蜜世界
I figured we needed some Mommy and Daddy time.

2179
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:09,880
你已经忘记我了吗
Have you forgotten me already?

2180
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:12,650
你是个很难忘记的人
You're impossible to forget.

2181
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:14,520
谢谢你
Thank you.

2182
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:21,860
拜托  肖恩  我不会给你下毒的
Oh, please, Sean, I'm not gonna poison you.

2183
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:24,630
如果我想除掉你  你早就死了
If I wanted to get rid of you, you'd already be dead.

2184
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:26,430
你在我的电脑里放了那些档案
You put those files in my computer.

2185
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:29,300
没错
Yes, I did.

2186
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:30,730
但是我的确得到了一位
But I did have help from a woman

2187
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:32,600
自愿帮我搞定一切的女人相助
who loves volunteering for everything.

2188
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:34,640
斯蒂芬妮
Stephanie.

2189
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:37,270
她没有她看上去那么可人吧
She's not as sweet as her snatch, is she?

2190
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:39,010
你到底有没有打算过告诉我你有一个双胞胎姐姐
Were you ever gonna tell me you had a twin sister?

2191
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:40,370
不关你的事
Wasn't your business.

2192
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:41,680
我是你的丈夫
I'm your husband!

2193
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:42,940
你在我的家里上我的
You've been fucking my best friend

2194
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:44,610
最好的朋友  然后现在拿出丈夫身份了
in my house, but now you're my husband?

2195
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:45,780
好吧
Okay.

2196
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:48,420
那我应该告诉你我们是三胞胎
Then I should probably tell you that we were triplets.

2197
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:49,620
细节
The details.

2198
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:50,620
妈妈们
Hi, moms!

2199
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:52,590
我是斯蒂芬妮
Stephanie here.

2200
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:54,990
我想想你们一直以来
I wanna thank you for all the love

2201
01:42:54,990 --> 01:42:56,420
给我的爱和支持
and support you've been sending me.

2202
01:42:56,430 --> 01:42:57,590
对我来说意义非凡
Means so much.

2203
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,930
虽然我和你们一样对事情的反转
You know, as shocked as you guys are

2204
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:06,570
感到非常震惊
about these turns of events,

2205
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:09,300
但我可以保证  没人比我更惊讶
I can assure you, nobody is more stunned than me.

2206
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:10,670
艾米丽有她的秘密
Emily had her secrets.

2207
01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:11,910
她的丈夫也是
So did her husband.

2208
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:14,510
显然  我就是那个被夹在中央的
Clearly, I was the naive romantic

2209
01:43:14,510 --> 01:43:16,380
天真烂漫的家伙
caught in the middle.

2210
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:19,010
我爱你们  我永远会爱你们
I love you guys. I always will.

2211
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:19,950
我希望你们会原谅我
I hope you can forgive me

2212
01:43:19,950 --> 01:43:21,520
所将要做出的事
in advance for what I have to do.

2213
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:24,320
妈妈们  凡事要亲力亲为
Moms, do everything yourself.

2214
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:25,550
天真烂漫

2215
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:28,920
斯蒂芬妮
Stephanie.

2216
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:30,460
你现在不该来这里
You shouldn't be here right now.

2217
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:32,530
我以前住在这里呢  记得吗
I used to live here. Remember?

2218
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:33,960
-不要再逼我...  -别动
- Don't make this any hard... - Don't move.

2219
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,000
斯蒂芬妮  拜托
Stephanie, please.

2220
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,930
你都不让孩子们玩玩具枪
You don't even let the boys play with squirt guns.

2221
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:41,800
那是在你告诉我你爱我
That was before you told me you loved me,

2222
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:43,640
但其实只是在背后嘲笑我之前
and it turned out you were laughing at me behind my back.

2223
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,670
斯蒂芬妮  也许我们该把这事放一放
Stephanie, maybe we should take it down a notch.

2224
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:47,370
你利用了我
You used me.

2225
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:48,940
你也利用了我
You used me, too.

2226
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:51,010
但你还让我给你做晚饭
But you had me making you dinner,

2227
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:53,950
给你看小孩  吃你的屌
watching your kid, and sucking your dick.

2228
01:43:53,950 --> 01:43:55,820
我不知道她还活着
I had no idea that she was still alive.

2229
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:56,950
别撒谎了
Stop lying.

2230
01:43:56,950 --> 01:43:58,720
好了  伙计们  我觉得我们
Okay, you guys, I think we

2231
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,450
应该坐下来  把话说开
should just sit down and talk this out.

2232
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:03,020
艾米丽  你才应该坐下  你恨斯蒂芬妮
Emily, you sit down. You hated Stephanie.

2233
01:44:03,030 --> 01:44:05,430
你以前都看着她的播客然后嘲笑她
You used to watch her vlog and rip her apart.

2234
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:06,990
我只想要成为你的朋友
All I wanted was to be your friend.

2235
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,730
你是
You were.

2236
01:44:08,730 --> 01:44:09,930
然后你上了我的丈夫
And then you fucked my husband

2237
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:10,900
还砸了我的骗保计划
and my insurance plan.

2238
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:13,830
别怪她  你就是这个样子
Don't blame her. This is so typical of you.

2239
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,440
肖恩  我只是不想让我们深陷债务
Sean, I was just trying to get us out of crushing fucking debt.

2240
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:19,110
没错  也许如果你能理智到给我打个电话
Oh, yeah. Maybe if you had the good sense to give me a call,

2241
01:44:19,110 --> 01:44:21,040
我能帮你完成你的小计划
I could've helped you with this little plot of yours.

2242
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,140
拜托  你十年来都没有
Oh, please, you haven't come up

2243
01:44:22,140 --> 01:44:23,410
想出什么像样的计划[情节]
with a decent plot in 10 years.

2244
01:44:23,410 --> 01:44:24,810
真的吗  现在提这茬
Really? Right now?

2245
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:27,520
作为拿枪的女士  我能说些什么吗
Can I say something, as the lady with the gun?

2246
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,050
你们这样的父母不配拥有尼基
Nicky deserves better than both of you.

2247
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:30,420
去你妈的  我爱我的孩子
Fuck you, I love my kid.

2248
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:31,620
闭嘴
Shut up.

2249
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:35,390
斯蒂芬妮  放下枪
Stephanie, put down the gun.

2250
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:36,820
你不想这么做的
You don't wanna do this.

2251
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:38,700
我其实还真的想
I really do, though.

2252
01:44:40,930 --> 01:44:42,400
我爱过你
I loved you.

2253
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:44,940
我也爱过你
I loved you, too.

2254
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:48,970
我觉得这样最棒了
I think this is the best thing.

2255
01:44:50,370 --> 01:44:52,840
我们可以说他攻击了我们  他们会相信我们的
Yeah, we could say he attacked us. They'll believe us, you know?

2256
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:55,580
不  你不是认真的  你不会杀了他
No, no, you're not fucking serious. You're not gonna kill him.

2257
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:58,110
我们只是要把他送进监狱
We're just gonna send him to jail.

2258
01:44:58,110 --> 01:45:00,580
你是认真的吗  你觉得进监狱就够了吗
Are you serious? Jail's enough for you?

2259
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:02,780
-你不用杀死他  -你不生气吗
- You don't need to kill him. - Aren't you angry?

2260
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:04,580
你不想为你的姐姐复仇吗
Don't you want revenge for your sister?

2261
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:07,450
想  但严格意义上来说  他并没有杀死她
Yeah, yes. But he didn't technically kill her.

2262
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:09,060
那是谁杀的
Then who did?

2263
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:11,530
因为我可不信这只是一起意外
Because I don't buy that it was an accident.

2264
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,670
算了
Screw this.

2265
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:19,700
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

2266
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:21,670
-操  -我的天啊  上帝啊
- Fuck. - Oh, my God. Jesus.

2267
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:23,600
上帝啊
Oh, my God. Um...

2268
01:45:23,610 --> 01:45:26,540
上帝啊  该死  他死了吗
Oh, my God! Shit! Is he really dead?

2269
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:29,080
肖恩  对不起  我该怎么办
Sean? I'm sorry. What do I do?

2270
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,680
你要压住吗
Do you put pressure on it?

2271
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:32,680
我们要叫救护车吗
Do we call an ambulance?

2272
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:35,080
就这么让他死吗  我是说...
Do I just let him die? I mean...

2273
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:36,880
这是他罪有应得  对吗
He deserved it, right?

2274
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:39,790
不  是我杀了她  我杀了我姐姐
No, I killed her. I killed my sister.

2275
01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:40,890
什么
What?

2276
01:45:40,890 --> 01:45:42,660
肖恩  肖恩
Sean? Sean!

2277
01:45:42,990 --> 01:45:43,990
起来
Get up.

2278
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:48,200
表演结束了  拜托
Show's over, come on.

2279
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,700
认真的吗  快点  起来
Seriously? Come on. Get the fuck up. Hey!

2280
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:52,170
你也是  白兰度
You too, Brando.

2281
01:45:52,170 --> 01:45:53,570
起来
Get up!

2282
01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:54,870
操
Fuck!

2283
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:04,740
真是意外
That was extra.

2284
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:06,910
我看到你们俩让警察安插在这里的麦克风以后
I mean, obviously, I knew you guys were up to something,

2285
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:08,520
就知道你们俩
when I saw both the mics

2286
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,690
肯定另有所图
that you had the cops plant in here.

2287
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:12,620
你们肯定想让我招供
You clearly wanted a confession out of me,

2288
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:14,190
好让你们洗清肖恩的罪名
so you could clear Sean's name.

2289
01:46:14,190 --> 01:46:17,690
但是这个办法真的不错
But that was a good way to go about it.

2290
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:19,630
不过你的败笔在于  宝贝
And where you messed up, though, baby girl,

2291
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:21,130
你竟然觉得我会坦白
is thinking that I would confess

2292
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:23,260
来保护这该死的废物吗
to protect that fucking yeast infection.

2293
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:25,130
-认真的吗  -好吧
- Really? - All right.

2294
01:46:25,130 --> 01:46:27,200
拜托  你们不会就这么点本事
Come on, you gotta know better than that.

2295
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:30,670
然后你一脸冲动地拔出了枪
But then you came in all emotional with the gun,

2296
01:46:30,670 --> 01:46:33,510
非常...非常逼真
and that was... That was convincing.

2297
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:34,670
没错
Yeah.

2298
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:35,680
非常有效果
It was very cinematic.

2299
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,880
我都不知道你这是从哪里找到的
I don't even know where you find this shit.

2300
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:39,280
你真的很厉害
You're really amazing.

2301
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:40,820
谢了  我很感激
Thanks. That means a lot.

2302
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:43,890
但你还是承认了  艾米丽
But you did confess, Emily.

2303
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:52,290
没错  但我事先就把这个切断了
I did. But I cut these first, though.

2304
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:54,560
我们的友谊手链
For our friendship bracelets.

2305
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,260
一条给你
One for you!

2306
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:59,630
太令人失望了
That is disappointing.

2307
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:02,970
天啊  看看我找到了什么
Oh! My God! Look what I found.

2308
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:08,110
好吧  你不能开枪打我们  警察就在外面
Okay. You can't shoot us. The police are outside.

2309
01:47:08,110 --> 01:47:10,310
不  他们没有
No, they're not.

2310
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:12,650
警察  我是斯蒂芬妮
Hey, cops, Stephanie here.

2311
01:47:12,650 --> 01:47:13,710
计划有变
Change of plans.

2312
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,950
我要去达伦家跟艾米丽和肖恩见面
I'm meeting Emily and Sean at Darren's house now.

2313
01:47:15,950 --> 01:47:17,050
到那儿见
I'll see you there.

2314
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:18,750
你把他们支去了达伦家
You sent them to Darren's house?

2315
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:20,950
是一种病毒
It's a virus.

2316
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,220
弦理论  弦理论  对吗
String theory. String theory, isn't it?

2317
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:26,190
举起手来  放下武器
Hands up! Weapons down!

2318
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:27,860
不  我有处方的
No, I have a prescription for that.

2319
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:29,600
我眼内压高
I have ocular pressure!

2320
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,070
拜托  我都逃亡了十年了
Come on, I've been on the run for 10 years.

2321
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:32,970
你们以为我不知道怎么操控系统吗
You think I don't know how to manipulate the system?

2322
01:47:32,970 --> 01:47:34,940
你要杀了我们吗
So you're gonna kill us?

2323
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:36,900
我还能怎么做呢
Well, what the fuck else am I supposed to do?

2324
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:38,570
你们俩肯定会用尽手段
You two will clearly go to

2325
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:40,210
想把我扳倒
extraordinary lengths to take me down.

2326
01:47:40,210 --> 01:47:41,880
你们知道得太多了
And you know too much.

2327
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,080
我觉得只有杀人后自杀的结局
So, I feel like a murder-suicide

2328
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,710
能适合你们俩
is the only fitting end for you two.

2329
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:47,780
如果你杀了他
And if you kill him,

2330
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:50,120
我觉得我们的保险还是能赔的吧
I think our insurance still covers that, right?

2331
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:51,920
这简直完美
I mean, sort of perfect.

2332
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:53,720
上帝关上了一扇门  却开了一扇窗
One door closes and another one opens.

2333
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:55,060
谢谢你
Thank you for that.

2334
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:57,160
你一直都是个该死的疯子  对吗
You always have been fucking crazy, haven't you?

2335
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:58,690
是吗
Have I?

2336
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:02,830
该死  你说得对
Oh, shit. You're right.

2337
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:04,700
天啊  你真的...真的开枪打我
God, you fucking... You actually fucking shot me.

2338
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,230
我会很想他的
I'm gonna miss him.

2339
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:08,240
轮到你了
Your turn.

2340
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:11,270
艾米丽  拜托
Emily, come on.

2341
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:13,040
你不会杀了我的
You're not gonna kill me.

2342
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:15,310
会的  我杀了我的爸爸和我的姐姐
Oh, yeah. I killed my dad and my sister,

2343
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:19,010
但我绝对不会杀死干我丈夫的最好的朋友
but I could never kill my husband-fucking best friend.

2344
01:48:19,010 --> 01:48:21,020
我真的是你最好的朋友
Am I really your best friend?

2345
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:23,180
你那么说不是只为了...
You're not just saying that for, you know...

2346
01:48:23,190 --> 01:48:24,990
不  我不仅仅只是说说而已
No, no, I'm not just saying that at all.

2347
01:48:24,990 --> 01:48:26,920
我担心只有我这么觉得
I get worried that it's just me.

2348
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:28,690
我知道  有时候我也会那么担心
I know, sometimes I was worried about that, too.

2349
01:48:30,030 --> 01:48:31,790
好难和其他妈妈们搞好关系
So hard to connect with other moms.

2350
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:33,860
然后当你还有一份全职工作时...那真是
And then when you have a full-time job, it's...

2351
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:35,400
好吧  别废话了
Okay, okay, don't pull that crap.

2352
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:36,760
做妈妈就是一份全职工作
Being a mom is a full-time job.

2353
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:38,670
我做的事很辛苦
What I do is hard work.

2354
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:40,030
我还要打理我的播客
And I have my vlog on top of that,

2355
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:41,770
现在已经越来越红了
and that's just getting bigger and bigger.

2356
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:43,840
如果你上我的播客  肯定会很有意思
If you came on the vlog, that'd be so fun.

2357
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,240
如果你上我的播客
If you came on the vlog

2358
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:46,220
承认你杀了
and confessed to killing

2359
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:48,140
你的父亲和你的姐姐  并拿枪指着我
your father and sister and held me at gunpoint,

2360
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:49,780
我肯定能有一百多万个关注者
I could probably hit a million subscribers.

2361
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:51,340
那真是太棒了
Aww. That would've been great.

2362
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:52,720
那为什么我们不现在就这么做呢
Why don't we do that right now?

2363
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:56,220
我们在直播呢  你不知道吗
We're live streaming. Did you not know that?

2364
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:58,050
你在说什么呢
What the fuck are you talking about?

2365
01:48:58,050 --> 01:48:59,590
这太失礼了  对不起
God, that's so rude, I'm sorry.

2366
01:49:00,220 --> 01:49:01,830
和妈妈们打个招呼吧
Wave hi to the moms!

2367
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:04,960
这些小装备
This little gadget. Boop!

2368
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,060
对  现在的保姆监控器都做得这么小
Yeah. They make nanny cams so small these days.

2369
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:10,230
干哥哥的
Brotherfucker!

2370
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:14,740
艾米丽
Emily!

2371
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:16,270
艾米丽  站住
Emily, stop!

2372
01:49:16,270 --> 01:49:19,170
艾米丽  你逃不掉的  不要这样对尼基
Emily, you can't outrun this! Don't do this to Nicky.

2373
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:20,810
拜托  你还是他的妈妈
Come on, you're still his mom.

2374
01:49:24,010 --> 01:49:25,020
没错
Yeah, I am.

2375
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:27,380
但你肯定不会是他的妈妈
But you sure as shit won't be.

2376
01:49:35,090 --> 01:49:36,790
美国混种
America's hybrids.

2377
01:49:36,790 --> 01:49:38,890
沉默寡言但一击毙命
Silent, but deadly.

2378
01:49:42,930 --> 01:49:44,800
我在播客上看到你了
I saw you on the vlog.

2379
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:48,030
你敢惹一个妈妈就是惹了我们所有人
You fuck with one of the moms, you fuck with us all.

2380
01:49:49,170 --> 01:49:50,740
艾米丽
Oh! Emily.

2381
01:49:51,470 --> 01:49:53,740
住手  艾米丽
Stop! Emily.

2382
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:56,010
这看上去特别疼
This looks super painful.

2383
01:49:56,010 --> 01:49:57,210
亲爱的
Now, sweetie.

2384
01:49:57,210 --> 01:49:59,910
别动了  你刚被一辆车撞了呢
Stop. You've just been hit by a car.

2385
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,350
别动了
Don't do this.

2386
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:03,720
我都开始担心你的膝盖了
I'm getting worried about your knees right now.

2387
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:06,160
放松

2388
01:50:11,490 --> 01:50:13,460

我还在努力改呢
