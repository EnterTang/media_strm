1
00:00:00,987 --> 00:00:02,598
"如果还有明天" 前情提要...
Previously on The Big C...

2
00:00:02,599 --> 00:00:04,734
我觉得自己看到了死亡天使
I think I'm seeing the angel of death.

3
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:07,677
他有一头黑发 还是卷的
He's got black hair. It's curly.

4
00:00:07,677 --> 00:00:10,567
凯西 化疗效果正好如我们所愿
Look, Cathy, the chemo is doing what we want it to do.

5
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:12,816
如果我是你 我会选择化疗
If it were me, that's what I'd be doing.

6
00:00:12,818 --> 00:00:16,228
好消息是... 你不是我
Good news... it's not you.

7
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:18,295
-你也得癌症了  -结肠癌
-You have cancer  -Colon.

8
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,461
-原来你也不是上帝  -我的确不是上帝
-You are not a God. -I'm not a God.

9
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:22,570
自从停止化疗后 我变得充满活力了
I have so much energy since I stopped chemo.

10
00:00:22,604 --> 00:00:23,803
我不想把所有这些事情
I don't want to leave all this stuff

11
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:24,886
都留给你和你爸来解决
for you and dad to deal with.

12
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:26,324
你不能一个人教育他
You don't get to parent him by yourself.

13
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:27,499
-但你将会  -什么
-You will. -What

14
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,583
我不在以后 你只能一个人教育他了
You will get to parent him by yourself when I'm gone.

15
00:00:29,593 --> 00:00:31,095
你的票在最上面
So your ticket is on top.

16
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:32,374
他们派了人在机场等你
They have somebody waiting for you at the airport.

17
00:00:32,374 --> 00:00:34,538
你的书在这里 他们也已经有这书了
Your book's in here, and they already have a copy on their end.

18
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:35,403
没有你我该怎么办
What would I do without you

19
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:36,907
我所能想到的是
All I can think about

20
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:39,644
我们有多疏远了
is how far apart we've gotten.

21
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,078
在我们剩下的时间里
With the time that we have left,

22
00:00:41,114 --> 00:00:44,734
我想知道要怎样才能再次回到
I want to figure out how to find my way back

23
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,685
你身边
to you.

24
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:47,625
你最近交上来的作业
I'm a little concerned about the work

25
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,361
让我有点担心
you've been handing in lately.

26
00:00:49,395 --> 00:00:51,830
我有一个朋友 我觉得她就快要死了
I have a friend, and I think she's gonna die soon.

27
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:54,532
因为我想让你看看这个
'Cause I wanted to show you that.

28
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:55,766
你能做这个吗
Could you make this

29
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:57,315
-我想被埋在里面 -好
-I want to be buried in it. -Yeah.

30
00:00:57,435 --> 00:01:00,103
我一直想给克雷格列表一些东西
I've been trying to give something away on Craigslist.

31
00:01:00,137 --> 00:01:01,604
你有什么可以给的
What do you have to give away

32
00:01:01,638 --> 00:01:03,014
噢 我多余的那个肾
Oh, my spare kidney.

33
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,107
哇 妈 你的脚怎么了
Whoa, mom. What happened to your leg

34
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:06,446
只是没什么力气
I'm just having some paralysis.

35
00:01:06,449 --> 00:01:09,054
我的另一只脚也会麻木吗 那手臂呢
Will my other leg go numb What about my arms

36
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,295
我会瞎吗
Will I go blind

37
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:13,882
蛋要焦了 老婆
Eggs are burning, sweetie.

38
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,552
你是谁
Who are you

39
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,913
亚当 宝贝
Adam, sweetie.

40
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:49,659
该死 我错过了你...
Shit. I missed your...

41
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:51,728
-现在几点了 -没事的 我...
-What time is it -It's okay. I'm...

42
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:53,329
不不不 我睡过头了
No, no, no, no, no. I overslept.

43
00:02:53,363 --> 00:02:55,231
嗯 从一到十级
Uh, on a scale from 1 to 10,

44
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:56,399
你有多痛
how bad is the pain

45
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:00,236
6.5吧 我不知道
6.5. I don't know.

46
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,305
这是... 我都糊涂了
This is... I'm confused.

47
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:04,741
十级很糟糕吗
Is 10 good or bad

48
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:07,743
我想"呕"
I'm like a "ugh"

49
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:09,610
在疼痛记录表上
on the pain chart thing.

50
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:13,749
感觉怎么样 老婆 一到十级
How you feeling, honey 1 to 10

-Look out, dad. Here. -Guys, guys.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,286
我以为你七点就给她吃药了呢
I thought you got her meds at 7:00 A.M.

53
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:18,821
我睡过头了 好吧
I overslept, okay

54
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:21,258
早上七点是你负责的 知道不
It is your job to cover the 7:00 A.M., okay

55
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:22,799
现在她这么痛苦
Now she's writhing in pain.

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,629
-保罗 我就六级吧 -这样很糟糕诶!
-Paul, I'm like a 6. -Well, that's bad!

57
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:27,498
好啦 只有四级
Okay, I'm a 4.

58
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:29,427
你本来才应该负责早上的 好吗
You should have taken the mornings, okay

59
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:30,535
可是你想要晚上的
But you wanted nights.

60
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:31,597
是啊 全都交给我
Clearly, I should have taken both.

61
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:32,920
好了!
Enough!

62
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,344
该走了
Time to go.

63
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:23,538
哦
Oh.

64
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:25,033
讨厌
Damn it.

65
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:27,796
我从来都没去过火腿博物馆
I never made it to the spam museum.

66
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:30,333
一直都离那里这么近...
I was so close this whole time...

67
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,227
火腿邻居
spam adjacent.

68
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:35,367
要不要停下 嘿...
Should we stop Hey...

69
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:38,904
谁想吃不知名的肉啊
Anybody hungry for mystery meat

70
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:45,156
如果我是火腿
I mean, if I were spam,

71
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:47,323
要是人们借我的名义在网上卖壮阳药的话
I'd be mighty angry that people were using my name

72
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:50,483
我一定会气死的
to sell penis enlargement pills on the Internet.

73
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:53,820
你怎么还笑得出来
How can you laugh right now

74
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:56,063
我都不知道我们干嘛要这么做
I don't even understand why we're doing this.

75
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:58,559
为什么...为什么你就放弃了呢 妈
Like, why... why are you just giving up, mom

76
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:01,629
为什么你不能和我们一起在家
Why can't you stay at home with us

77
00:05:01,663 --> 00:05:03,798
靠边停
Pull over.

78
00:05:03,832 --> 00:05:06,634
靠边停
Pull over.

79
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:14,143
我们该做的都做了
We've been over this.

80
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:17,513
我的肿瘤在变大 我好不起来了 亚当
My tumors are growing. I'm not getting better, Adam.

81
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:19,138
我脑袋里面的那个...
The one in my brain...

82
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,861
我都忘记你爸爸是谁了
I forgot who your father was.

83
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:23,386
它往左边挪了一毫米 我才记起他来
It moved a millimeter to the left, I remembered him,

84
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,545
我的眼睛就更惨了
my eyes got all screwed up.

85
00:05:24,586 --> 00:05:28,257
我也不知道接下来会怎样
And I don't know what's coming next.

86
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,661
你们已经把我
You guys have done an amazing job

87
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:35,164
照顾得很好了 但我不是你们生活的全部
of taking care of me, but it can't all be about me.

88
00:05:35,198 --> 00:05:37,233
已经够了
It's enough.

89
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,776
你很累 又缺课
You're tired. You're missing class.

90
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:40,222
还和爸爸起争执
You're arguing with your father.

91
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:42,104
在安养院里
And in hospice,

92
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:45,007
他们一天二十四小时都会照顾我的...
they'll take care of me 24-7...

93
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,843
止痛药 食物 所有的一切
pain meds, food, everything.

94
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:49,412
我并没有放弃
And I'm not giving up.

95
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:51,486
我只是为我们大家...
I'm making a choice...

96
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,312
做了一个选择
for all of us.

97
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:56,169
我们还是可以期待奇迹出现的
We can still hope for a miracle,

98
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,001
但如果没有的话
but if there isn't one,

99
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:00,203
我可不想让我们家永远地变成
I don't want our home to forever be known

100
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:02,402
"老妈翘辫子的地方"
as "the place mom kicked it."

101
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,950
我想要那里有你们快乐的回忆...
I want happy memories for you there...

102
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:08,229
只有快乐
only happy.

103
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:10,965
好吗
Okay

104
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:19,588
好
Okay.

105
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:21,948
走吧
Let's go.

106
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:45,302
噢 天呐 这帮人
Oh, for God's sake, people,

107
00:06:45,303 --> 00:06:46,700
如果这是我的最后一程
if this is gonna be my last ride,

108
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,237
那最好比现在要更有趣
it better get more fun than this.

109
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,158
靠边停
Pull over again.

110
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:04,987
死人要开车了
Dead woman driving.

111
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:06,738
-凯西-你不能
-Cathy. -You can't.

112
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,429
如果我连一个愉快的谈话都不能享受到
If I can't have one enjoyable conversation,

113
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,722
那我至少也要让自己
I'm gonna at least give 

114
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:12,589
有最后一次快乐的驾驶经历吧
myself one final joyride.

115
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,101
不用担心... 如果我眯起眼
And don't worry... if I squint,

116
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,011
我还是能辨认出中线在哪里的
I can just make out where the center line is.

117
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:18,702
你开吧
Why not

118
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:24,963
妈 开慢点
Mom, slow down.

-Hang on! -Do it, baby!

122
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,756
老天呐!
Jesus Christ!

123
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,838
宝贝 你看得到吗 看得到吗
Honey, can you see Can you see

00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:43,145
噢 天啊 我们要死了! 要死了!
Oh, God, we're gonna die! We're gonna die!

127

129
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,533
凯西说真的 快停下
Cathy, seriously, stop.

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,181
停车吧 一点也不好玩
Please stop. It's not funny.

131
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:52,813
我们死定了
We're not gonna make it.

132
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,303
-嗯 -哦 老天
-Uh -Oh. Jesus.

133
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:57,372
-哦 老天啊 -靠
-Oh, thank God. -Shit.

好了 大... 大家都镇定些
All right, ev... everyone just be calm...

要乖乖的有礼貌
And be nice and polite

136
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,721
还要...微笑
and just... and smile.

137
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:15,781
-我去 -这哪里是礼貌
-Fuckin' man. -This is not polite.

138
00:08:15,782 --> 00:08:16,952
我得做我该做的嘛
Well, I need to do what I have to do.

139
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:18,397
我是黑人
I'm black.

141
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:36,075
夫人 知道我为什么要你靠边停吗
Ma'am, you know why I pulled you over

142
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:37,958
我猜得到啊
Well, I have an educated guess.

143
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,782
你继续 你才是警察
But go ahead. You're the one with the badge.

144
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:42,215
你告诉我吧 我猜你一定最喜欢这段了
You tell me. I bet this is your favorite part.

145
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:43,646
继续
Go ahead.

146
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:45,385
你在限速五十迈的地方飙到了九十迈
You were going 90 in a 50 zone.

147
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,187
-天啊 -还好啦
-Jesus. -Not bad.

148
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:48,755
你们有一车的人
You have a full car here.

149
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:50,456
照这个速度 一场车祸可能会致伤
At that speed, an accident could lead to injuries

150
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,024
甚至是死亡
or even fatalities.

151
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:54,368
我有过这种想法
Well, you know, I have, at one time or another,

152
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:56,228
杀光所有我载的人
wanted to kill each of my passengers.

153
00:08:56,262 --> 00:08:57,596
回的漂亮
Right back at ya.

154
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,131
夫人 你是在顶嘴吗
Ma'am, are you talking back to me

155
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:02,329
没错 我就是在顶撞你
Yep. I am most definitely sassin' you.

156
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:06,204
我可以给你开一张扰乱社会治安的罚单
I could give you a ticket for disorderly conduct.

157
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:08,206
警官 我就是个不正常的人
Well, officer, I'm fairly disordered.

158
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:09,374
你能给我也写一张吗
Could you write me one too

159
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,775
很抱歉 警官
I apologize, officer.

160
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,042
我...我在想
I... I'm wondering,

161
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:14,068
你是生下来就这么的被动反抗呢
were you born being passive-aggressive,

162
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:16,114
还是说戴上太阳眼镜就这反应
or did that just come with the reflective sunglasses

163
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:17,573
-老天啊 -在学校里你是
-Oh, boy. -Were you the one

164
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:19,805
被欺负的人 还是欺负别人的混蛋
who got beaten up at school, or were you the bully

165
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:21,453
不 真的 我很想知道
No, really, I'm curious.

166
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:24,957
这是超速的
This is for the speeding.

167
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,125
这是...
And this one's...

168
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,794
顶撞我的
for the sass.

169
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:34,132
由于你的无礼 我们一个月后法庭见
See you in court in a month for the sass.

170
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:37,669
好好玩吧
Have fun.

171
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,338
嘿 猜怎么着
Hey, guess what.

172
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:41,674
我正要去安养院 所以...
I'm driving myself to hospice, so...

173
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,944
碰到这个不错吧
good luck collecting on that one.

174
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:49,148
右边的尽头是我们的餐厅
So just down at the right is our cafeteria

175
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:50,984
还有工艺美术室
and our arts-and-crafts room.

176
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:53,153
礼拜二在那里我们有竞争很激烈的
We have some very competitive bingo games in there

177
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:54,921
宾果游戏
on Tuesdays.

178
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:56,423
我们会给你配个助行架
Uh, and we'll be getting you a walker

179
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:57,791
这样你走动就方便多了
so you can get around more easily.

180
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:59,292
嗯 真贴心
Mm. Sweet.

181
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:01,828
-新的轮子 -噢 你好啊!
-New wheels. -Oh! Hello.

182
00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:03,330
你好
Hello.

183
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:05,766
哦 这是贝思妮...
Aw, and this is Bethany...

184
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,201
在我们这里住的猫
our resident cat.

185
00:10:07,235 --> 00:10:10,504
哈 安养院里有九条命的动物
Ah, an animal with nine lives in a hospice.

186
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:12,681
讽刺啊
Ironic.

187
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,921
礼拜四我们有宠物疗法
We do pet therapy on Thursdays.

188
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:17,094
你会惊讶它是多么的镇定的
You'd be surprised how calming it is

189
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:20,146
就是拍拍猫咪或是抱只小兔
just to pet a cat or hold a bunny.

190
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,715
推圆盘游戏在哪里 好像一个大型油轮
Where's the shuffleboard It's like a cruise ship.

191
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:24,663
你们两个跟我来
If you two could come with me,

192
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:27,788
还有最后一些文件需要你们签字
I just have some last papers for you to sign.

193
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:30,023
借过
Excuse me.

194
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,859
像大型油轮 泰坦尼克号啊
Like a cruise ship Try the Titanic.

195
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:34,527
嘿 放松点
Hey, easy.

196
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:36,863
哦 抱歉 我的白大褂综合症
Oh, sorry. It's just my white coat syndrome

197
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:37,864
又开始发作了
is really kicking in.

198
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:38,876
你到底
How in the hell

199
00:10:38,882 --> 00:10:40,619
能不能撑完一个肾脏手术
are you gonna get through a kidney operation

200
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,949
你现在看见护士
when you can't even look at a nurse

201
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,800
可都吓尿了
without shitting yourself

202
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:47,720
我也不知道
I have no idea.

203
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,910
好吧 我们把凯西安置下来
Okay, we're gonna get Cathy settled.

204
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:53,479
直系亲属请随我来
Immediate family is welcome to come with us.

205
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:54,914
其他人明天可以探访
Anyone else can visit tomorrow.

206
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,752
我就免了吧
I... I'm good.

207
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:03,323
我也是
Me too.

208
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:05,893
真遗憾
This sucks.

209
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:13,366
好了 我知道这让你难以接受
Okay. I know this freaks you out.

210
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:18,338
可要试着来看看我 好吗
Try and visit, okay

211
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:20,273
别看那些护士
Don't look those nurses in the eye.

212
00:11:27,248 --> 00:11:30,818
过来 过来
Come here. Come here.

213
00:11:32,587 --> 00:11:35,589
别把脏碗留在房间 好吗
Don't leave dirty dishes in your room, okay

214
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:37,758
我不会给你收拾了
I'm not gonna be there to clean up after you,

215
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:40,093
没有妹子喜欢脏家伙的
and no girl likes a slob.

216
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:44,899
知道了吗
Okay

217
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:47,034
知道了

218

好的
Okay.

219
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:53,074
我爱你
I love you.

220
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:56,044
说吧
Say it.

221
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:58,123
我爱你
I love you.

222
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:00,983
再见 妈妈
See you, mom.

223
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:04,086

Okay.

224
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:05,942
好的
Okay.

225
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:07,535
请问一下
Excuse me.

226
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,926
我妈妈真的很坚强
My mom is, like, really strong,

227
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,463
她疼的时候不会讲
and she may not tell you when she's in pain.

228
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:13,214
我们会好好照顾她的
We'll take good care of her.

229
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:14,503
那就好
Yeah, okay.

230
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:16,380
她可能看起来不需要用药
She makes believe she doesn't need her meds

231
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:17,823
其实她需要 知道吗
when she does, okay

232
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,199
知道了
Okay.

233
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,812
-准备好了吗 -是
-Are you ready -Yeah.

234
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:38,157

Okay.

235
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,625
凯西这是楠

237
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,661
你是什么病
What you in for

黑素瘤
Melanoma.

239
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,365
要命的病啊

241
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:51,489
我是保罗 瘤的先生
Paul. "Mr. Noma."

242
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:53,539
这真美
These are lovely.

243
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,452
在我们的文化中 这象征着好运
In my culture, they're good luck.

244
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:58,478
任何人叠一千只纸鹤
Anyone who folds 1,000 cranes

245
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,146
就会梦想成真
will have their wish granted.

246
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:03,258
靠纸鹤 别倒抽一口气啊
By a crane. Don't hold your breath.

247
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:05,061
我爸爸原来带着我打猎
My dad used to take me hunting

248
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:07,183
就是狩猎这些沙地鹤
for those sandhill cranes.

249
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,223
我杀了一直跟我娃一样大的
I once bagged one the size of my own kid.

250
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:17,496
我很支持鹤的 真的
I'm, uh, very pro-crane, actually.

251
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,998
我喜欢仙鹤
I love cranes.

252
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,133
真是个漂亮的房间啊
This is a lovely room, isn't it

253
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:24,290
真是个重磅消息啊
Wow. That's really great news.

254
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,204
没错 通常不会这么快找到
It is. We don't usually find so many matches

255
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,006
配型的
so quickly.

256
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,508
把你的肾捐给陌生人
You're doing a great deed

257
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,310
真是再世雷锋啊
donating your kidney to a stranger.

258
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:34,345
这会改变别人一生的
It's gonna change someone's life.

259
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:37,371
我好伟大哦
Yay, me.

260
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:38,561
我们想尽快行动
So we obviously want to get moving

261
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:40,771
检查你的兼容性
and select your recipient as soon as possible.

262
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:42,521
如果你能在这些术前准备资料
So, if you could just give us your consent signature

263
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,532
的同意下方签字...
on these pre-op pages...

264
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,444
且慢 等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

265
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:47,860
别着急啊 分解我的医生
Not so hasty there, Dr. Pull-Me-Apart.

266
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,243
我叫兰登
Rand.

267
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:51,939
兰登医生 我平常不做手术
Dr. Rand. And I don't actually do the operation.

268
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,066
对 可是你认识做手术的人啊
Yeah, but you know the guy who does, right

269
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,268
那是当然
Sure, of course.

270
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:01,073
我在手术桌上的死亡率
Me dying on the table... chances

271
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,908
这只是个常规手术
It's a very routine operation.

272
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,042
没必要担心
No reason to worry.

273
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,879
绝对安全 绝不会死
So no chance Zero chance

274
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,547
也不能这样说
Well, I don't know if we can say that.

275
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,833
但死亡率低于百分之一
But less than 1%, certainly.

276
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,551
看吧 还是有些倒霉蛋死掉
See, some poor sucker had to die

277
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,286
要不死亡率就是零了
to make that more than zero.

278
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,055
要是我倒霉怎么办
What if I'm that guy

279
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,403
我就是那命不好的
I mean, I'm the... I'm the "slim chances" guy.

280
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:22,928
我还在漱口水里遇到过老鼠尾巴呢
I'm the guy who found a rat tail in a bottle of mouthwash once.

281
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,296
好吧
Okay...

282
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:27,066
在做任何手术前
It's quite normal to get jittery

283
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,601
紧张心情可以理解
before an operation of any kind.

284
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:31,070
我们可以给你注射镇定剂
We can give you a sedative before we put you under.

285
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:34,010
有人注射过量 就醒不来的吗
Anyone ever get over-sedated, never wake up

286
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:38,004
因为 我命不好
Because again, rat tail... "Slim chances" guy.

287
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:42,412
托克先生 这是个完全自愿的手术
Mr. Tolke, this is a completely elective operation.

288
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,282
你不是非得要捐肾脏
You don't have to give up your kidney.

289
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,716
你可以改变主意
You can change your mind.

290
00:14:46,914 --> 00:14:47,985
是啊 那我不就是
Eh, yeah, but then I'm the schmuck

291
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:50,922
见死不救的大混蛋吗
who could have saved somebody's life, but didn't.

292
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:53,389
那把资料拿回家吧
Why don't you take the papers home...

293
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,259
好红考虑一下
And think about it

294
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:10,837
不错嘛
Not bad.

295
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:12,104
弹得不错
Not bad.

296
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:14,072
我有动力了
I'm motivated.

297
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:16,608
我要在死前学件事
I... I want to learn the whole thing before I go.

298
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:19,410
因为你觉得自己的生命打了折扣嘛
'Cause you feel like your life has been cut short,

299
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:22,179
起码你还能做完这件事
and at least you can finish this one thing.

300
00:15:23,097 --> 00:15:24,014
-不是 -不是
-No. -No

301
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,116
我只是想弹艺术家罢了
I just want to learn how to play The Entertainer.

302
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:31,487
我真高兴心理医生上门服务了
But I'm awfully glad that my shrink makes house calls.

303
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:34,255
哪里需要我 我就去哪里
I go where I'm needed.

304
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,401
来安养院了哈
So the hospice, huh

305
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,645
感觉如何啊
How does this feel

306
00:15:39,863 --> 00:15:42,130
我能跟你说件事吗
Can I tell you something

307
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:43,700
当然
I hope so.

308
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:46,553
我真的喜欢这里
I really like it here.

309
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:50,203
我充满愧疚 我应该恨这里的
I feel so guilty. I mean, I know I should hate it.

310
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:52,138
我应该为我家人感到遗憾
I should feel bad for my family,

311
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:55,141
可我却大松一口气
but all I feel is relief...

312
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:56,876
知道他们不用再担心我
that they don't have to take care of my anymore,

313
00:15:56,911 --> 00:16:00,046
我不需要假装坚强
I don't have to say I feel good when I feel like shit.

314
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,815
所以你很开心做了这个决定
So you're happy you made this decision

315
00:16:04,685 --> 00:16:06,466
以前是个决定
Because it was a decision.

316
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:09,499
现在我是必须到这来
This is how I want to go.

317
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:11,367
这是授权的
That's empowering.

318
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,944
我得说凯西
You know, I have to say, Cathy,

319
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,746
你看起来比以前自在多了
you seem more relaxed than you have in months.

320
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,666
不是我吹...
Not for nothing, but the...

321
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:25,572
这吗啡输的真像在天堂啊
the morphine drip is heaven.

322
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:27,874
你现在倒相信天堂了
Oh. So now you believe in heaven

323
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:31,344
弗莱迪克 惠明顿的响尾蛇
The Rattlesnake by Fredrick Remington...

324
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,680
从毛绒的腿部到马的肌肉
from his wooly chaps to the horse's muscles,

325
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:36,483
完美展示着所有细节
this has got it all as far as detail goes.

326
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,918
-真是美轮美奂 -你们饿了吗
-Just wonderful. -You guys hungry

327
00:16:38,953 --> 00:16:40,587
我做了无负担披萨
I made gluten-free pizza.

328
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:42,055
真是一件上品
It's just a wonderful piece to have.

329
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:43,925
好吧
All right.

330
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:45,192
男士留着胡须
The gentleman has quite the mustache.

331
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:47,194
我明白了 你们要充充电
I get it. You need to recharge.

332
00:16:47,228 --> 00:16:48,929
现在是最难熬的日子
These are stressful times.

333
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:50,163
我出去走走
I'm going for a walk.

334
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:52,366
450美元 475
$450, $475.

335
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,002
495 有人出价495
$495. I have $495.

336
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:56,270
恭喜拍得 
Congratulations, by the way,

337
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:58,573
无论谁拍得挂毯
to whoever got that tapestry.

338
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:01,108
我真的很喜欢那件
I just adore that piece.

339
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:03,544
响尾蛇由495拍得
I'm at $495 for the Rattlesnake.

340
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:05,212
数量有限 只多一块钱哦
The reserve is met. It just takes $1 more.

341
00:17:05,247 --> 00:17:07,715
去楼上充充电 好主意
Recharge upstairs. Great idea.

342
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,239
亚当
Adam.

343
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,041
你怎么醒了
Why are you up

344
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:35,645
-你疼了吗 -不不不
-Are you in pain -No. No, no, no.

345
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,748
宝贝 你不该来这
Honey, you shouldn't be here now.

346
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:40,816
现在是半夜啊
It's almost midnight.

347
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:42,920
我睡不着
I couldn't sleep.

348
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:44,097
我偷溜进来的
I, uh... I snuck in.

349
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:46,596
他们这里安保很差诶
By the way, they have really bad security here.

350
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:50,759
谁没事闯进安养院干什么
Not a lot of people want to break into a hospice.

351
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,229
也没人有劲跑出去
And no one's strong enough to break out.

352
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:59,268
当你还是小不点 得了感冒的时候
When you were little and had a cold,

353
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:02,906
我曾溜进你的房间 睡在地板上
I used to sneak into your room and sleep on the floor.

354
00:18:03,822 --> 00:18:06,977
我担心你不通气
I was worried that you were so stuffed up,

355
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:09,680
不能呼吸了
you wouldn't be able to breathe.

356
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,316
我抱着你的小头
I'd hold your little hand.

357
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,285
在你嘴边放一个镜子
I would put a mirror next to your mouth

358
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,520
来确保你还在呼吸
to make sure you were still breathing.

359
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:18,789
有用吗
Did it work

360
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:20,633
你现在不活的好好的
You're here.

361
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:24,262
这倒是
Yeah.

362
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,627
那个神经病装饰是怎么回事
So what's with the crazy decorations

363
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,795
那个啊
Oh, yeah.

364
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:35,274
明显是求好运的嘛
Apparently they're good luck.

365
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:36,616
这样你睁开眼
So, when you look up,

366
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:41,315
你会觉得一切都会好好的
you can feel like everything's gonna be okay.

367
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:43,617
我喜欢
I like 'em.

368
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,878
宝贝 你该回床上睡觉去
Honey, you need to go sleep in your real bed.

369
00:18:49,582 --> 00:18:51,519
我想你保证...
I promise you...

370
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:54,344
我在这里很好
I'm okay here.

371
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:57,464
你可以明天再来嘛
We can visit tomorrow, okay

372
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:01,337
你要不睡我就不走
I'm not going anywhere till you go back to sleep.

373
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:04,006
知道了吗
Okay

374
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:26,880
别问是谁干的
Don't ask me who's responsible.

375
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,014
我可发誓不说的
I've been sworn to secrecy.

376
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,428
不过干这事的小伙子
But the young man who did that

377
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:35,933
真聪明敏捷
is very agile.

378
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:38,102
看看
Look at that.

379
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,439
他五点来的
He came in here at 5:00 this morning

380
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,798
把一切弄好了
and put it all up.

381
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,125
你养了个好儿子
You raised a good kid there.

382
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,979
希望如此 
Oh, I hope so, Nan...

383
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,948
不然现在在这事上也很难
'cause it's a little late at this point

384
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,650
作调整了
for major alterations.

385
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,255
你知道嘛...
You know...

386
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,824
在我的贴花和你的纸鹤
between my collage and your cranes...

387
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:05,164
我们绝对是这里最热闹的房间
we are definitely the most festive room in here.

388
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:08,500
我讨厌纸鹤
Oh, I hate these cranes.

389
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:11,676
-真的吗 -是啊 它们在嘲笑我
-You do -Yeah, they taunt me.

390
00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:14,198
我让贺若一直做下去
I let Hiro keep on making them

391
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:17,476
是因为我知道他想要奇迹
because I know he wants a miracle.

392
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,480
他真的很想让我活下去
He wants me to stay alive so much.

393
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,883
我准备好走了
I'm ready to go.

394
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:28,020
可还得为他撑一会
But I have to stick it out for him.

395
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:29,989
你真的觉得你已经准备好了么
You really feel like you're ready

396
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:32,491
对
Oh, yeah.

397
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:34,193
我是说 当你每天依赖吗啡
When you're living your life on morphine

398
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:36,462
和氧气罐活着...
and an oxygen tank...

399
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,798
有时还需要大麻来刺激自己
once lived on LSD

400
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:42,001
然后在伍兹多可跳舞...
and danced at Woodstock...

401
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:43,503
我觉得是时候看开了
It's time to kick it.

402
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:45,505
伍兹多可
Woodstock

403
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,540
-真的么 -噢...
-Really -Oh...

404
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:51,010
孩子 我很喜欢跳舞的
Roomie, I lived it up.

405
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:53,513
我曾经有幸福的生活...
I had a great life...

406
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:56,192
有孩子 有孙子...
kids, grandkids...

407
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:00,519
还有贺若
Hiro.

408
00:22:03,185 --> 00:22:05,376
这是我们在大学的时候照的
This is us at college.

409
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:08,026
哇 看看啊
Oh, look at you.

410
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,028
你好漂亮
So beautiful.

411
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,764
那时我才十九岁
Barely 19.

412
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,514
看起来完全就像另外一个人
It seems like someone else.

413
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:21,313
我们都年轻过...
But we were all young once...

414
00:22:21,802 --> 00:22:23,561
那时候我们天不怕地不怕
invincible.

415
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:26,265
是时候走了吧
Time to go, I say.

416
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:28,249
我还不想死
I'm not ready.

417
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:32,049
你当然没有
No, you're not.

418
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,252
死兆根本没注意你
Deathany is not paying you any mind.

419
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,020
谁是死兆
Who's Deathany

420
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,589
我说的是贝思妮
Bethany.

421
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,557
那只猫 知道么
The cat

422
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,793
我们之所以叫它死兆 是因为它可以预知死亡
We call her "Deathany" because she can tell

423
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,095
当有些人快死的时候
when people are gonna die,

424
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,063
它会跑过去坐在他们的床边
and she goes and sits on their bed.

425
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:49,366
这太诡异了
Oh, that's creepy.

426
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,436
我猜也许是因为它能闻到死亡的气息
I guess she can smell death.

427
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:58,109
我想知道死亡是一种什么味道
I wonder what death smells like.

428
00:22:58,512 --> 00:23:01,471
他们说中风的人闻起来像面包
They say a stroke smells like toast.

429
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:05,855
我觉得死亡闻起来会像腌咸菜
I bet death smells like Sauerkraut.

430
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:11,187
或者像指甲油清洗剂
Old nail Polish remover.

431
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:16,340
我想在死兆预示到我会死之前
I want to go

432
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:18,699
就静悄悄地死掉
before Deathany singles me out...

433
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:20,008
噢 我也是
Oh, God, me too.

434
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,690
在我变臭了或疯了之前
Before I get all smelly and crazy

435
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:25,105
在没人愿意跟我住一间房之前就死掉
and no one will room with me.

436
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:29,142
说真的 如果你觉得我要死了
In fact, you see me heading in that direction,

437
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:31,911
你就直接让我解脱好了
you just take me out... put me out of my misery.

438
00:23:32,493 --> 00:23:33,933
成交
Deal.

439
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,901
还有 对我 你也要一样
Only, you have to do the same for me.

440
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:38,832
就是 当我闻起来像泡菜的时候...
You smell Sauerkraut...

441
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:41,019
说定了
Done.

442
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,194
好了 大家伙们
Okay, people,

443
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:52,297
星期六的走秀成绩占你们总成绩的一半
Saturday's runway show counts for half your grade.

444
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:54,533
这规矩又不是我定的
I don't make the rules.

445
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,298
我只是按照客座教授的指示做事罢了
I'm just following the visiting Professor's handbook.

446
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:01,412
嗨 这衣服很漂亮
Hi, fancy.

447
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,608
会不会太过头了
Too much

448
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,356
噢 没有 超爱的
No. Love.

449
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:08,075
你那本书给了我很多灵感
Your Egyptian book really inspired me.

450
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,981
很好 唔 但是当你剪裁这边的接合处时
Oh, good. Um, just don't lose

451
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:12,649
不要忘记我们这次的艺术主题
that amazing motif on the hip

452
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,384
就重点在衣服腰部这一块
when you cut into the side seam.

453
00:24:14,806 --> 00:24:17,022
我不用裁这衣服
I can't cut it.

454
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,789
安德莉亚 这里 你得
Oh, but, Andrea, you have, like,

455
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:20,523
至少剪掉两英寸
at least 2 inches of excess here.

456
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:21,992
我是说 二号身材的模特
I mean, your size-two model

457
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,994
都可以在你这八号的衣服里游泳了
is gonna be, like, swimming in a size eight.

458
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,896
额 其实我模特的身材刚好是八号
Well, my model is a size eight.

459
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,520
我是为我朋友做的
I made it for my friend

460
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,099
这样她就可以在她的葬礼上...
so she can wear it in her...

461
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,359
穿这件衣服了
in her coffin.

462
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:37,163
喔噢 我也是第一次碰到这样的事
Wow. That's a first, even for me.

463
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:39,787
好吧
Okay, uh...

464
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:41,264
这些别针... 
pins... 

465
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:43,412
永远都不能少了别针 对吧
pins are your new best friend, right

466
00:24:43,447 --> 00:24:47,015
直别针 安全别针 双面胶 钉子
Straight pins, safety pins, double-sided tape, staples.

467
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,650
算了 不管那么多了 
What the hell Go crazy.

468
00:24:48,685 --> 00:24:51,520
但你要让这件衣服展现出我们的主题
But you pin that waif model into this work of art.

469
00:24:51,554 --> 00:24:52,721
好么
Okay

470
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:54,990
我不想在T台上看见
Okay, I do not want to see

471
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:57,359
一个全身挂满珠宝的死气沉沉的麻袋
a bejeweled death sack come down the runway.

472
00:24:57,393 --> 00:25:00,395
好的
Okay.

473
00:25:03,732 --> 00:25:05,199
嗯 我想知道
You know...

474
00:25:05,526 --> 00:25:06,767
为什么你们会在一个
why would you ever take a job

475
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:08,862
每天都有人死去的地方工作
where you watch people die all day

476
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:11,256
被需要的感觉很好
I like to feel needed.

477
00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:13,063
工资很不错
It pays well.

478
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:15,656
噢 我喜欢诚实的人
Oh, well, points for being honest...

479
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:18,323
我也喜欢你们陪我吃饭
and points for eating with one of the sickies.

480
00:25:19,283 --> 00:25:20,701
这让我觉得我还是正常人
That makes me almost feel well again,

481
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:21,748
谢谢你们
so, thanks for that.

482
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:23,550
其实我们也早就厌倦跟对方说话了
Well, we're tired of talking to each other,

483
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,217
所以 也谢谢你
so, thank you.

484
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:27,802
这里的卤汁面条挺不错
This lasagna you guys serve is not bad.

485
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,421
可能是因为我太开心终于不用做饭了
Maybe I'm just thrilled not to be cooking for once.

486
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:32,223
你会吃腻的
You'll get tired of it.

487
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:33,725
我希望我能活到
I hope I stick around long enough

488
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,395
吃腻的那一天
to get tired of it.

489
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:43,301
这里大部分人可以撑多久
How long do most of us stick around for

490
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:44,769
这不好说
Well, it depends.

491
00:25:44,803 --> 00:25:46,737
有些病人来到这里后觉得很放松
Some patients are so relieved to be here,

492
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:48,039
第一个晚上就离开了
they pass their first night.

493
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:49,704
其中一些在这里住了几个月之后
Some people go for months.

494
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,776
病情会开始好转
Start to get better.

495
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:54,140
这东西真的不好说
You never really know what's coming.

496
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:57,249
不过好多东西都一团糟
We've seen some wild shit.

497
00:25:57,283 --> 00:25:58,450
想到这个
Speaking of shit,

498
00:25:58,484 --> 00:26:00,608
我今天还得再去打扫八号房间
I have to clean room eight again.

499
00:26:00,731 --> 00:26:02,443
那老家伙腹泻拉的厉害
Guy crapped his pants so bad,

500
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:04,457
刚刚还把屎拉在头上
he had shit on the top of his head.

501
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:07,148
能把屎拉在头上 这也是种本事呵
How the heck do you crap on your own head

502
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:09,044
还有 十二号房间的
I'll tell you something, room 12,

503
00:26:09,163 --> 00:26:10,470
他们想让我清理拉在头发上的脏东西
they don't pay me enough to clean shit

504
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:12,766
却付不起钱
out of somebody else's hair.

505
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,334
我说 你看那尿布
I mean, look... look at that diaper.

506
00:26:14,368 --> 00:26:16,402
他就像个大婴儿
He's like a... big baby.

507
00:26:16,437 --> 00:26:19,272
约斯 你还是闭嘴吧
Jose, shut your mouth.

508
00:26:19,306 --> 00:26:21,674
-凯西 -你说什么
-Cathy. -Huh

509
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,465
我说我的名字...
My name...

510
00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:26,846
叫凯西不叫 "十二号房间的"
is Cathy, not "room 12."

511
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:28,908
这只是我们通常用来...
Hey, it's just something we use to...

512
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:31,684
干什么 告诉别人你和我们不一样
What, pretend that you're not us

513
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,286
听着
Let me tell you something.

514
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,154
八号房间里那个穿着尿布的人
Room eight, the guy with the diaper,

515
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:36,690
就是你以后的样子
that's gonna be you one day,

516
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:38,825
当然我是说如果你有幸能活到他那个年纪
if you're lucky enough to live that long.

517
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,490
总有一天你也会坐着等死
All of us, the dying ones, you're gonna be us.

518
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:42,451
我们这些将死之人也都健康地活过
We used to be you.

519
00:26:42,452 --> 00:26:45,330
西姆巴 这就是生命交替的方式 
It's the circle of life, Simba.

520
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:46,833
是的 现在我是快要死了
I'm gonna be dead.

521
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:48,602
你有一天也会拉稀拉在裤子上
You're gonna be crapping your pants,

522
00:26:48,636 --> 00:26:50,804
那个时候你会希望别人来照顾你
and you're gonna wish someone cared enough about you

523
00:26:50,838 --> 00:26:53,273
来给你擦屁股
to clean up your shit.

524
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:01,189
等等 让我帮你... 
Oh, wait, let me help... 

525
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,015
不用了 谢谢
No, thank you.

526
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:23,369
西得 我现在要借用一下你的照片
I'm borrowing this, Sid.

527
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:56,570
我看起来和照片上一样吧
I look the same.

528
00:27:56,604 --> 00:27:57,771
嗯
Yeah.

529
00:28:14,923 --> 00:28:17,215
这样你就不会忘记
So you never forget.

530
00:28:17,216 --> 00:28:20,456
我们曾经也很快乐很健康...
We were all cute and healthy...

531
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,729
就像你一样
and could wipe our own asses once,

532
00:28:22,764 --> 00:28:24,724
也可以自己擦屁股
just like you.

533
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:46,952
你在床上呆了一整天么
Were you in bed all day

534
00:28:49,264 --> 00:28:50,896
应该是吧
I guess so.

535
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:54,246
额 我饿了
Well, I'm hungry.

536
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:55,829
你想吃晚饭吗
Do you want to get dinner,

537
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:57,930
出去吃块披萨什么的
maybe go out for a pizza or something

538
00:28:57,964 --> 00:29:00,333
嗯 我想想...
Um, I'm, uh...

539
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:01,968
其实我还不饿
I'm not really hungry, bro.

540
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:03,437
就只要...
Just, uh...

541
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,353
不用管我了
I'm good.

542
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:07,942
好吧 那...
Okay, well...

543
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:09,477
我身上没有钱
I don't have any money.

544
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:11,580
我把妈妈留下来备用的钱都花光了
I used all the cash mom left in the emergency drawer.

545
00:29:11,614 --> 00:29:13,949
钱包在我楼下的夹克里
Mm. Wallet's in my jacket downstairs.

546
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:17,686
你想要多少就拿多少吧
Just... just grab what you need, okay

547
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,257
好的
Okay.

548
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,867
你闻起来像腌咸菜
Sauerkraut. You smell.

549
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:33,135
楠! 楠 不要!
Nan! Nan, no!

550
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,505
-我是来帮助你的 -楠!
-I'm here to help. -Nan!

551
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,473
-你的时候已经到了 -楠 别这样!
-No, it's time. -Nan, Nan. No!

552
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:40,009
楠! 我都没闻到!
I do not smell! Nan!

553
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:41,544
-楠! -是泡菜的味道
-Nan! -Sauerkraut.

554
00:29:41,578 --> 00:29:43,479
护士!
Nurse!

555
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:44,948
这里需要...
We need...

556
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:45,964
你的气味就像咸菜 
Sauerkraut. You smell. 

557
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:47,483
别这样 喂 我们这里需要...
No, we just need...

558
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:49,452
楠 回去戴上氧气罩
No, Nan. Breathe your oxygen.

559
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,722
像咸菜一样 还记得么
Smell Sauerkraut. Remember

560
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,490
你快要死了
It's time to die.

561
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:54,991
护士!
Nurse!

562
00:29:55,318 --> 00:29:56,960
你就要死了
It's time to die.

563
00:29:56,994 --> 00:29:58,194
你的味道
Sauerkraut.

564
00:29:58,452 --> 00:29:59,876
就像咸菜一样
You smell.

565
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,131
护士!
Nurse!

566
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:06,036
护士! 护士!
Nurse! Nurse!

567
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,205
护士!
Nurse!

568
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,732
法乐瑞护士!
Nurse Valerie!

569
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:11,614
法乐瑞护士! 醒醒!
Nurse Valerie, wake up!

570
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:13,831
快来帮一下我 法乐瑞护士!
Nurse Valerie, do something!

571
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,512
她想杀我
She's trying to kill me.

572
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:17,514
这老太婆想杀我!
The bitch is trying to kill me!

573
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:24,822
楠!
Nan!

574
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,823
楠
Nan

575
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,743
她是那么漂亮...
She was beautiful...

576
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:23,781
那么年轻
and so young.

577
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,816
你是说那个鬼魂么
The ghost

578
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:28,552
她... 真的 她就那样走出楠的身体
She... she practically jumped out of Nan's body,

579
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,821
向我招招手 然后就走开了
waved, and walked away.

580
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:33,788
你认为我疯了吧
You think I'm losing my mind, right

581
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:37,629
不 我相信你看到了你所看到的
No, I... I think you saw what you saw.

582
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:41,097
可是我不太清楚那是不是真的
I'm not sure it matters if it was real or not.

583
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,800
你肯定觉得我脑子糊涂了
You definitely... you think I'm crazy.

584
00:31:43,252 --> 00:31:44,835
我怎么想并不重要
It doesn't matter what I think.

585
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,503
关键是你的想法
It matters what you think.

586
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:48,606
好吧
Oh. Wow.

587
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,307
看来以后我该换个说法了
I guess I need some new material.

588
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,675
显然是的
Mm, evidently.

589
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,894
我是说 可能我的大脑
I mean, maybe it's my mind

590
00:31:52,895 --> 00:31:55,448
在跟我开玩笑呢
just playing tricks on me.

591
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:57,681
这些乱七八糟的东西
These mets are tricky fuckers.

592
00:31:58,163 --> 00:31:59,858
你害怕这些东西么
Does that scare you

593
00:32:00,306 --> 00:32:01,985
你是说没办法分辨真假
Not being able to tell what's real

594
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,621
让我想想... 
Mm... let's see.

595
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:06,523
是的
Yeah.

596
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,124
还会害怕
Also scary.

597
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,026
每天都有人在你面前死去
I mean, having someone die right in front of you.

598
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,627
也许这个体验
I mean, I know this whole experience

599
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:13,629
会让我面对死亡时好过一点
is supposed to make me feel better about dying.

600
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:14,630
我明白了
I mean, I get it.

601
00:32:14,645 --> 00:32:16,132
能自由楠一定很高兴
Nan was so happy to be free.

602
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,634
但是让我不断想起的却是
But the only thing that I could think of

603
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,636
当那个袋子套住我的时候 我...
when that bag was over me was I'm not...

604
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,139
我没准备好面对死亡
I'm not ready to die.

605
00:32:22,428 --> 00:32:23,853
我想活下去
I want to live.

606
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,630
我没准备好
I'm not ready.

607
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:32,593
我不停地看着那个傻钟
I keep looking at that dumb clock,

608
00:32:32,596 --> 00:32:33,779
滴答 滴答 我的生命就这样流失
tick, tick, ticking my life away,

609
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,190
却无法制止
and I want it to stop.

610
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:39,137
我想要更多的时间
I want more time.

611
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:51,673
凯西...
Cathy...

612
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:53,769
我觉得这并不疯狂
I don't think you're crazy.

613
00:32:54,258 --> 00:32:56,522
我好天真
I was so naive.

614
00:32:57,939 --> 00:33:00,211
这个地方...
This place...

615
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:04,643
带笑脸的钟表 宾戈游戏 还有...
with the happy clocks and the bingo and the...

616
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,228
带樱桃图案的枕罩
The cheery pillow fabrics.

617
00:33:06,229 --> 00:33:09,690
真是好伪装
It's camouflage.

618
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,893
人在这里死去...
People die here...

619
00:33:12,928 --> 00:33:15,196
每天...
every day...

620
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,090
丑陋残忍 让人无法平复的死亡
ugly, brutal, dramatic deaths...

621
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,168
每天如此
every day.

622
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:26,146
那和真实世界有不同吗
And that's different from the real world how

623
00:33:45,354 --> 00:33:46,451
他得了重感冒
Well, he has a bad cold.

624
00:33:46,452 --> 00:33:48,877
他不想让粉丝们也传染到
He doesn't want to get any of his fans sick.

625
00:33:49,148 --> 00:33:50,732
嘿 你拿了我的...
Hey, did you take my...

626
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:52,534
我明白你是恼火那个演出场所卖掉了
I understand that you're upset that the venue is sold out,

627
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:54,069
可我们无能为力呀
but there's nothing we can do about it.

628
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:56,571
他个混蛋 我...
He's cont... I...

629
00:33:56,606 --> 00:34:00,242
先生 没必要说脏话吧
Sir, it is not necessary to use that ugly language.

630
00:34:00,395 --> 00:34:01,564
你猜怎么着
You know what

631
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,796
打开开关吧!
Flip your friggin' switch!

632
00:34:04,006 --> 00:34:05,671
嗨 很抱歉哦
Hi. So sorry.

633
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:07,121
你把我的盘子收走了 
Did you take my dishes 

634
00:34:07,122 --> 00:34:08,479
噢 是你床边的那些吗
Oh, the ones by your bed

635
00:34:08,484 --> 00:34:10,285
是啊 我洗过把它们放在橱柜里了
Yeah, I washed 'em and put 'em back in the cabinet.

636
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:11,699
你到我房间干什么
What were you doing in my room

637
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:14,092
嗯 门开着那些盘子就好像在说
Well, the door was open, and the dishes were like,

638
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,957
求求你 把我们洗了吧 我们快要僵掉了
"help, wash us. We're all crusty."

639
00:34:15,991 --> 00:34:18,746
我自己会处理的 安柏 不用你费心
Those were my dishes to deal with, Amber, not yours.

640
00:34:18,747 --> 00:34:20,734
我记得你的工作不就是
Last time I checked, your job was to just talk

641
00:34:20,735 --> 00:34:22,964
带着蠢蛋耳机说话 和我父亲做生意嘛
on that stupid headset and deal with my dad.

642
00:34:22,998 --> 00:34:24,966
没人要雇你当妈妈 知道吗
No one hired you to be my mother, okay

643
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,925
我不需要新妈
I don't need a new mother.

644
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:28,287
-我妈活着呢 -我知道
-She's still alive. -I know that.

645
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:30,939
但是众所周知
But it's widely acknowledged

646
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:32,774
一个家庭成员的即将逝去
that the imminent death of a family member

647
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:35,444
会造成巨变
causes a great upheaval.

648
00:34:35,478 --> 00:34:36,441
我已经为我的心理分析论文
I've done a ton of research 

649
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:37,245
做了一大堆研究资料了
for my psych paper.

650
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,447
怎么着
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

651
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:40,327
你还写出来了
You're writing about this

652
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,343
我快要拿到临床心理分析的硕士学位了
Uh, I'm getting my master's in clinical psychology.

653
00:34:43,352 --> 00:34:44,686
你不会以为我要当一辈子
I mean, you didn't think I was gonna

654
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,288
小助理吧
be an assistant forever, right

655
00:34:46,322 --> 00:34:48,657
所以你名曰帮忙 实来监视
So you're helping out here to spy on us

656
00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:50,793
不 不 我是想来帮...
No, no, no. I want to help...

657
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:54,797
你和保罗还有...其他人的
you and Paul and... and others.

658
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:57,800
我理解你会觉得受到了威胁
I understand that you feel threatened,

659
00:34:57,835 --> 00:34:59,502
那再正常不过了
and that's perfectly normal,

660
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,303
而且你对你的父亲有些怨恨
and it's also totally appropriate

661
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:04,696
也是很完全适当的
for you to feel some kind of resentment toward your father.

662
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:08,294
噢 天呐
Oh, my God.

663
00:35:08,295 --> 00:35:10,312
你被炒掉了
You are so fired.

664
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,115
你不能解雇我 我为保罗工作的
You can't fire me. I work for Paul.

665
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,772
是啊 不过保罗已经三天没起床了
Yeah, well, since Paul hasn't gotten out of bed in three days,

666
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,106
我说了算
I'm in charge.

667
00:35:17,107 --> 00:35:19,555
你可以拿着你的调查赶紧滚蛋了!
So you can pack your research and get the fuck out!

668
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,688
某些想要成为心理医生的人
For someone who wants to be a shrink,

669
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,895
你怎么说不听啊
you don't listen good.

670
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:27,830
滚啊!
Get out!

671
00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:36,207
答应我你会在秀场上拍照
Promise me you'll take pictures at the fashion show.

672
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:37,909
我会的 别担心
I will. Don't worry.

673
00:35:37,943 --> 00:35:40,311
如果你想要剪掉这条裙子 只管剪好了
And, look, if you have to cut the dress, cut it.

674
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:43,141
没关系 我可以穿别的在我的棺材里
No, I can wear something else in my coffin,

675
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:45,149
比如比基尼
like a bikini.

676
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:48,485
我很长时间没穿了那两件套了
I haven't worn a two-piece in ages.

677
00:35:48,553 --> 00:35:51,363
-病傻了 -那是你的裙子
-Morbid -It's your dress.

678
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,226
我不会为了那些瘦骨嶙峋的人把它毁掉的
I'm not gonna ruin it just to fit some twiggy-ass beanpole.

679
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,929
哦 我...也许不会成为一个瘦骨嶙峋的人
Oh, I... I may not be a twiggy-ass beanpole,

680
00:35:57,963 --> 00:36:00,436
但我可有个泼妇的脸
but I do a mean bitch face.

681
00:36:01,922 --> 00:36:03,000
那才可怕好嘛
You know, it's an awful lot

682
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,570
就像脸上写着我在便秘
like your signature "I'm constipated" look.

683
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,641
嘿...
Hey...

684
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:11,481
关于你室友的事情 我很抱歉
I'm really sorry about your roommate.

685
00:36:11,562 --> 00:36:14,084
我也是 我挺喜欢她
Me too. I liked her.

686
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:17,047
我猜我不应该和这里的任何人有联系
I guess I shouldn't get attached to anyone in here.

687
00:36:17,732 --> 00:36:18,784
我真希望
I was really hoping

688
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:21,005
今天保罗可以和你一起来
that Paul would come visit with you today.

689
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:23,478
哦 他超级忙
Oh, he is super busy.

690
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:25,999
算了 说实话吧
Ah, tell the woman the truth.

691
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,525
他沮丧消极 整天在床
He's depressed and bedridden...

692
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:30,928
吃着霉菌当早饭
with a side of funyuns for breakfast.

693
00:36:30,962 --> 00:36:32,457
他只是需要一些时间
He just needs some time.

694
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,265
你知道是有原因的我... 我都
You know, not for nothing, I'm... I'm the one

695
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:36,100
要这些蜂窝似的房间里爆发了
who breaks out in hives in these places,

696
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,100
我还在这
and I'm here.

697
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,037
你的肾脏怎么样
How's your kidney stuff going

698
00:36:40,071 --> 00:36:41,906
哦 桃红色
Oh, it's just peachy.

699
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,974
很快我就要少个器官了
I'll be down one organ in no time.

700
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:45,217
嘿 安德莉亚你需要什么东西吗
Hey, you need anything, Andrea,

701
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,341
你知道啦 比如肺 角膜
like a, you know, lung, a cornea

702
00:36:47,525 --> 00:36:51,248
哇 不用了 谢谢
Aw. No, thank you.

703
00:36:52,285 --> 00:36:54,385
嘿 看那个
Hey! Well, look at that.

704
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:55,620
小猫
A cat.

705
00:36:55,654 --> 00:36:57,121
嘿 快乐猫
Hey, there, happy cat.

706
00:36:59,525 --> 00:37:02,213
他们叫她死兆
They call her Deathany.

707
00:37:02,214 --> 00:37:04,662
很显然 她在挑下一个要死的人
Apparently she singles out the next one to die.

708
00:37:04,732 --> 00:37:06,685
她坐在你的床上 你就要走了
She sits on your bed, you're a goner.

709
00:37:06,686 --> 00:37:09,300
她是猫界的死神
She's the grim reaper of the feline world.

710
00:37:09,335 --> 00:37:11,366
好了 呃 再见 走吧 现在
Okay. Uh, bye-bye. Go away now.

711
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:12,553
别回来
Fuck off.

712
00:37:12,554 --> 00:37:15,807
再见
Bye-bye. Shoo.

713
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,277
肖恩 如果你想走的话没关系的
Sean, if you want to go, it's okay.

714
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:20,945
嗯 我像是有艾滋
Yeah, I... I'm getting a little hivey.

715
00:37:21,128 --> 00:37:22,348
是啊 走吧
Yeah, go.

716
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,992
我要出去逛一会
I'm gonna hang out for a while,

717
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,183
半个小时后 亚当会来的
and Adam will be by in half an hour.

718
00:37:26,218 --> 00:37:28,319
我会帮你买个打猫的玩具手枪
I'm gonna buy you a cat cap gun.

719
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:32,756
再见
Good-bye.

720
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:35,359
离那个猫远点啊
Stay clear from that cat.

721
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,541
在我监视下 你谁也不准杀
You are not killing anyone on my watch.

722
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,982
哦 看看是谁起来了
Oh, look who's up.

723
00:37:58,016 --> 00:37:59,717
嘿
Hey.

724
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:02,520
我用你的钱买了些生活用品
I bought groceries with your money.

725
00:38:02,554 --> 00:38:04,722
鸡蛋 牛奶 差不多基本的东西都没了
We were out of eggs and milk, and pretty much everything else,

726
00:38:04,756 --> 00:38:06,023
我以前从没买过
and I've never done it before,

727
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:07,992
所以很可能都买错了
so I probably bought the wrong stuff.

728
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,859
你见到安柏了吗
Have you seen Amber

729
00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:12,014
我得和她再对对
I'm supposed to go over my schedule

730
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,031
下两个星期的日程
for the next couple weeks with her.

731
00:38:13,065 --> 00:38:14,399
可我找不到她
I can't find her.

732
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:16,334
嗯 她不会再回来了
Yeah, um, she's not coming back

733
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:19,705
因为我把她炒了
because I fired her.

734
00:38:19,957 --> 00:38:21,713
你怎么了
You what

735
00:38:21,908 --> 00:38:23,869
没错 她很烦人
Yeah. She's a pain in the ass.

736
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:26,679
她没事写我们的事情
She was, like, writing this paper about us,

737
00:38:26,713 --> 00:38:28,347
好像我们是突变体之类的
like we were mutants or something.

738
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,815
你炒掉她了
You fired her

739
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,350
你没有权利解雇她
You had no right to fire her.

740
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:32,418
她为我工作
She works for me.

741
00:38:32,452 --> 00:38:33,678
哦 你还负责啊
Oh, you're in charge

742
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,095
很抱歉 我不明白 
I'm sorry. I was confused 

743
00:38:35,096 --> 00:38:37,071
因为我还以为你只住在楼上呢
because you live upstairs.

744
00:38:38,247 --> 00:38:39,856
亚当...
Adam...

745
00:38:40,977 --> 00:38:42,823
我感觉很不好
I'm feeling really shitty.

746
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:45,731
是吗 妈妈快死了 爸爸
Oh, yeah Yeah Well, mom's dying, dad.

747
00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:47,667
你为什么不赶紧穿上你那白痴裤子
Why don't you throw on a fucking pair of pants

748
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,736
去看看你的老婆
and go see your wife

749
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:52,718
我是你父亲 你怎么和我说话的
I'm your father. You don't talk to me that way.

750
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:54,273
哦 现在你是父亲了
Oh, now you're all fatherly

751
00:38:54,308 --> 00:38:58,044
上帝 你真...你真悲哀
Jesus, you're... you're pathetic.

752
00:38:58,078 --> 00:39:00,015
你不要做让我感觉遗憾的事 听见了吗
You don't make me do something I'm gonna regret, all right

753
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:01,915
什么意思 
What do you mean, like this

754
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:03,717
他妈的你以为你是谁
Who the fuck do you think you are

755
00:39:03,751 --> 00:39:06,586
你给我滚远点!
Get the fuck off me!

756
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:13,460
-他妈的 -滚蛋
-Fucker! -Get... get off!

757
00:39:13,647 --> 00:39:14,928
他妈的!
Fuck!

758
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,451
护士!
Nurse!

759
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:01,442
护士 护士!
Nurse, nurse!

760
00:40:05,485 --> 00:40:07,319
护士
Nurse!

761
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,299
你知道我害怕 对吗
You know this was my fear, right

762
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:03,071
我想逃走 一切都塌了下来
I'd leave and everything would fall to pieces.

763
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:08,375
我知道 你不会试着想要杀死对方
I didn't think you'd actually try and kill each other.

764
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:11,179
他把安柏解雇了
He fired Amber.

765
00:41:13,215 --> 00:41:17,184
真...真的吗
Re... really

766
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:20,887
哦 天呐 我喜欢那个孩子
Oh, God, I love that kid.

767
00:41:23,646 --> 00:41:27,264
你不在身边 凯西...
It hasn't been easy, Cathy...

768
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:30,263
一切都不容易了
not having you around.

769
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:33,537
我知道这你过得很艰辛
I know this has been hard on you...

770
00:41:34,584 --> 00:41:36,818
还有害怕
and scary.

771
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:40,050
我也怕
I'm scared.

772
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,610
但是我要你坚强起来
But I need you to be the strong one...

773
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:47,712
为我...
for me...

774
00:41:47,747 --> 00:41:51,416
为亚当
for Adam.

775
00:41:51,451 --> 00:41:53,585
他只是个孩子 保罗
He's just a kid, Paul.

776
00:41:53,818 --> 00:41:57,122
我知道他看起来也许不像 但他还是啊
I know he doesn't seem like it, but he still is.

777
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:05,098
让他吃饱
Feed him.

778
00:42:05,132 --> 00:42:07,800
给他拥抱
Hug him.

779
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:11,193
我希望我能帮着你
I wish I could be there to help you.

780
00:42:12,335 --> 00:42:14,912
我不断地想着那间房子
I keep imagining the house...

781
00:42:15,655 --> 00:42:18,061
有你们俩...
and the two of you...

782
00:42:19,278 --> 00:42:22,313
我只是个幽灵
and me just a shadow.

783
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:27,228
我只能躺在这里的 保罗
I can only lay here, Paul.

784
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,190
但是你可以起来
But you can get up.

785
00:42:31,573 --> 00:42:35,794
你就起来
So you get up.

786
00:42:35,828 --> 00:42:38,403
你要试着前进 好吗
And you try and move on, okay

787
00:42:41,531 --> 00:42:43,587
好吗
Okay

788
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:49,127
你把你老爹暴打了一顿
So you beat up your dad

789
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:50,926
哇噢 真精彩
Wow. Impressive.

790
00:42:50,965 --> 00:42:54,118
我大学毕业了 才敢跟我爸动手
I didn't lay hands on my pop until college graduation.

791
00:42:54,293 --> 00:42:57,460
他喝得烂醉 我觉得他肯定不会感觉到什么
He was so drunk, I'm pretty sure he didn't feel a thing.

792
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,542
哦 看看谁来了
Oh, look who's here.

793
00:43:00,553 --> 00:43:04,790
嘿 宝贝
Oh, baby.

794
00:43:06,894 --> 00:43:08,391
你还养猫
You have a cat

795
00:43:08,528 --> 00:43:11,096
小火花 来见见亚当
Sparkles, meet Adam.

796
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,965
亚当 这是小火花
Adam, Sparkles.

797
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:15,167
好吧 小火花也算名字
Okay. Sparkles

798
00:43:15,202 --> 00:43:16,127
那当然
Yeah.

799
00:43:16,128 --> 00:43:19,103
我想取又轻又亮之意 懂吗
I... I wanted something light and bright, you know

800
00:43:19,172 --> 00:43:21,773
这猫可是见证过黑暗时期的啊 哥们
I mean, this cat has seen some dark times, my friend.

801
00:43:22,097 --> 00:43:24,309
我将它从满目凄凉中救起
I rescued her from a bleak situation,

802
00:43:24,343 --> 00:43:26,211
我要让她打起精神
so I got to change up her energy,

803
00:43:26,245 --> 00:43:29,814
所以有了头上小球的装饰
hence the... the little puff-ball headgear

804
00:43:29,848 --> 00:43:34,719
还有写着公主的可爱衣衣
and the, uh, the baby "T" that says "princess."

805
00:43:34,754 --> 00:43:37,389
他们竟然还真有卖猫衣服的
Can you believe they actually sell cat clothes

806
00:43:37,423 --> 00:43:39,157
我差点在那店里给它
I mean, I nearly walked out of that place

807
00:43:39,192 --> 00:43:41,392
买了个人造毛坎肩
with a little faux fur shrug for her

808
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:43,970
还有一件我穿的衣服 写着"少惹爷的猫"
and a T-shirt for me that said, "don't pet my pussy."

809
00:43:44,058 --> 00:43:46,494
好吧 你就把我跟小火花一样收养了吧
Yeah, well, maybe you can adopt me along with Sparkles.

810
00:43:46,495 --> 00:43:49,403
那敢情好 你穿那坎肩肯定可爱
Yeah, you'd look pretty cute in faux fur.

811
00:43:49,404 --> 00:43:52,778
我真不懂我爸为什么对咱们这样
I don't get how my dad can just totally check out on us.

812
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:54,639
这段心酸历程大家都要经历
You know, it's like, we're all going through this shit,

813
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,085
又不是你一人的
not just you.

814
00:43:56,086 --> 00:43:58,365
每人的处理方式不一
Oh, everyone deals differently.

815
00:43:59,623 --> 00:44:01,879
我们之中 你才是狠角色啊
Out of all of us, you're the real badass.

816
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,348
你能捐肾才真是大义凛然啊
It's so cool that you're giving away your kidney.

817
00:44:04,383 --> 00:44:07,318
要我肯定吓尿了 而你呢
I'd be scared shitless, dude, but you're like,

818
00:44:07,352 --> 00:44:10,396
不过就是身体器官嘛
"yo, dude, just take my body part."

819
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:15,090
说实话 哥们 我也吓得半死
I'm not gonna lie, man. I'm... I'm pretty freaked out.

820
00:44:15,091 --> 00:44:15,861
少装了
Yeah, right.

821
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:18,361
你被捅了还住在大街上
You got stabbed, and you lived on the street.

822
00:44:18,396 --> 00:44:20,163
世上就没有能吓着你的事吧
I mean, there's no way this freaks you out.

823
00:44:20,198 --> 00:44:21,857
这就是小事一桩嘛 
This is nothing for you. 

824
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:23,366
我不会说这是小事
No, I wouldn't say nothing.

825
00:44:23,401 --> 00:44:25,979
这是个大手术
I mean, it is major surgery.

826
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,811
哥们 别跟我爸一样娘们
Dude, don't go all pussy like my dad,

827
00:44:27,812 --> 00:44:29,605
不然我就一个哥们也没了
or else I got nobody.

828
00:44:33,577 --> 00:44:35,578
感觉怎么样啊
How's the patient

829
00:44:39,984 --> 00:44:43,420
喜出望外啊
Surprised and flattered.

830
00:44:43,455 --> 00:44:45,296
我以为进了这地方
I thought you people forgot about us

831
00:44:45,297 --> 00:44:47,224
你们就把我忘了呢
once we got shipped off to places like this.

832
00:44:47,386 --> 00:44:50,061
永远不会 你看上去不错
Never. You look good.

833
00:44:50,095 --> 00:44:52,897
别说好话了 你...
Forget good. You...

834
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:55,600
才真是容光焕发啊
look positively radiant.

835
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,101
我是说 对于结肠癌患者而言
I mean, for someone with colon cancer,

836
00:44:57,135 --> 00:44:58,403
你真是状态不错啊
you look practically well.

837
00:44:58,437 --> 00:45:00,471
我要吃你的药
I want what you're having.

838
00:45:00,506 --> 00:45:01,973
我确实感觉精神饱满
I do feel pretty chipper.

839
00:45:02,007 --> 00:45:03,775
我很欣慰 谢尔曼医生
I'm really glad, Dr. Sherman.

840
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:05,410
至少让我们俩人活一个
I want at least one of us to make it,

841
00:45:05,444 --> 00:45:08,613
既然你还是癌症医师
and since you are the cancer doctor,

842
00:45:08,647 --> 00:45:10,414
我看让你活下来
I think it's only fair that you be the one

843
00:45:10,448 --> 00:45:11,448
更公平
to stick around.

844
00:45:11,483 --> 00:45:13,083
好好努力...
Just try and...

845
00:45:13,118 --> 00:45:15,720
一劳永逸的治愈这麻烦吧
just cure this shit, once and for all.

846
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:20,425
你怎么样嘛
How you doing

847
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,961
这个嘛...
Well, you know...

848
00:45:22,996 --> 00:45:25,928
我在安宁疗护 混得还挺好的
I'm at hospice, so I could be better.

849
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:27,115
幽默感还在嘛
You still have your sense of humor.

850
00:45:27,116 --> 00:45:28,644
很好 保持住
That's good. Keep it up.

851
00:45:29,054 --> 00:45:30,548
我告诉你件事
I want to let you in on something

852
00:45:30,549 --> 00:45:32,806
也许是不言自明的
that may be self-evident.

853
00:45:33,285 --> 00:45:35,060
这个地方...
This place...

854
00:45:36,758 --> 00:45:39,181
充斥着死亡的气息
it's filled with death.

855
00:45:39,644 --> 00:45:43,365
人们离世 是件庄重的事
People passing away... it's a serious thing.

856
00:45:45,453 --> 00:45:47,766
你说死的时候疼吗
You think it hurts to die

857
00:45:48,631 --> 00:45:49,957
我没有指精神上
I mean, not just emotionally,

858
00:45:49,991 --> 00:45:52,812
是肉体上的
but my body.

859
00:45:54,717 --> 00:45:55,653
我会疼吗
Will I be in pain

860
00:45:55,654 --> 00:45:57,431
我的肌肤会疼吗
Will my skin hurt

861
00:45:58,175 --> 00:45:58,977
说实话
Tell you the truth,

862
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:02,441
我见过许多病人离世
when I've seen patients pass away...

863
00:46:02,442 --> 00:46:05,486
有时是很痛苦的
Yeah, sometimes they are in pain.

864
00:46:05,487 --> 00:46:09,976
不过可以靠药物缓解
But you can control that with drugs.

865
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:13,979
可是大部分 他们都看起来
But often, they just seem...

866
00:46:14,014 --> 00:46:15,948
平静
almost serene...

867
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,483
安详
relaxed.

868
00:46:17,517 --> 00:46:21,487
你这么说是想让我好受点吧
You saying that just to make me feel better

869
00:46:21,594 --> 00:46:23,925
我这辈子骂名不少
I've been accused of many things.

870
00:46:23,926 --> 00:46:27,293
弄糖衣炮弹 干不出来
A sugarcoater Never.

871
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,628
实话
True.

872
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,165
其实 死亡还是让人着迷的
You know, death has got a bad rap.

873
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:37,003
它让生命有了意义
It's the only thing that makes life matter.

874
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:38,971
如果我们的生命无穷无尽
If we didn't have an expiration date...

875
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:41,507
-注定一事无成 -没错
-Nothing would ever get done. -Exactly.

876
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:44,476
还有那些要死前去威尼斯的人
All those, uh, "I got to see Venice before I die" people.

877
00:46:44,538 --> 00:46:45,686
他们就会往后退
They'd just put it off.

878
00:46:45,745 --> 00:46:47,881
我明年去也来得及啊
"You know, maybe I'll go next year."

879
00:46:47,915 --> 00:46:50,717
或者他们能去一百次
Or... or they'd go 100 times.

880
00:46:50,751 --> 00:46:53,019
然后就会说 还是
And then they'd be like, "eh.

881
00:46:53,265 --> 00:46:56,081
呆在家吧 太多鸽子了
Let's stay home. Too many pigeons."

882
00:46:56,811 --> 00:46:58,925
那小船的座位太不舒服啦
Those gondola seats hurt my ass.

883
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,594
听着就不好玩
It just does not sound fun.

884
00:47:00,628 --> 00:47:02,529
好吧
Okay.

885
00:47:02,563 --> 00:47:04,364
死亡万岁
Yay, death.

886
00:47:04,399 --> 00:47:08,034
死亡万岁
Yay, death.

887
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:11,037
谢尔曼医生 我郑重声明 你变乐观了
Dr. Sherman, I do declare, you've become an optimist.

888
00:47:11,313 --> 00:47:13,010
不准这样说我
You take that back.

889
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:19,061
谢谢你
Thank you...

890
00:47:19,279 --> 00:47:20,622
没有忘了我
for not forgetting me.

891
00:47:20,623 --> 00:47:22,543
永远不会
Never.

892
00:47:23,264 --> 00:47:24,519
过会再来看你
I'll see you again soon.

893
00:47:24,554 --> 00:47:26,755
希望如此
I hope so.

894
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,768
敲门咯
Knock, knock.

895
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:41,804
想吃午餐了吗
Ready for a little lunch

896
00:47:42,189 --> 00:47:43,956
当然
Oh, why not

897
00:47:44,332 --> 00:47:46,101
把果冻拿来吧
Bring on the jell-o.

898
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,069
今天挺开心的嘛
Somebody's happy today.

899
00:47:49,364 --> 00:47:51,749
谢尔曼医生让我心情不错
Dr. Sherman put me in a good mood.

900
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:56,060
真没想到我能出说这种话
Now, there's a sentence I never expected to say.

901
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:59,589
我最初遇到他时 我觉得
When I first met him, I thought he was

902
00:47:59,623 --> 00:48:01,891
他是世界上最难相处的人了
the least friendly person I had ever met.

903
00:48:01,925 --> 00:48:04,593
彻头彻尾的大混蛋 让你见笑了
I mean, a real asshole. Pardon my French.

904
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:06,795
可是逐渐了解后 他...
But you get to know him, and he's just...

905
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,165
真的是大好人
he's a big softie.

906
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,568
他是个又风趣又聪明 
I mean, he was someone's funny...

907
00:48:12,602 --> 00:48:16,405
又温柔的孩子
smart, soft kid.

908
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,308
好像给他一个大大的拥抱
Makes me just want to give him a big hug.

909
00:48:18,342 --> 00:48:21,945
我会想念他的
Yeah, I miss seeing his face around here.

910
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:24,515
他会回来的 我保证
Oh, he'll be back, I'm sure.

911
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:26,617
亲爱的...
Honey...

912
00:48:26,934 --> 00:48:29,453
谢尔曼医生上周去世了
Dr. Sherman passed away last week.

913
00:48:34,326 --> 00:48:37,762
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

914
00:48:43,502 --> 00:48:46,838
谁是爸爸的小公主啊
Who's daddy's little baby princess

915
00:48:46,872 --> 00:48:48,640
好孩子
Good girl.

916
00:48:48,674 --> 00:48:50,141
看到了吧
See

917
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,450
看到了吧 小火花 看到这里多舒服了吧
See, Sparkle See how nice it is here

918

看到了吧 什么坏事都不会发生哦
See Nothing... nothing bad's gonna happen now.

919
00:48:57,883 --> 00:49:02,352
什么坏事都不会发生
Nothing bad is gonna happen now.

920
00:49:04,222 --> 00:49:07,658
没有坏事
Nothing... bad...

921
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:11,229
发生哦
is gonna happen now.

922
00:49:12,698 --> 00:49:17,201
没有坏事发生哦
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

923
00:49:17,235 --> 00:49:20,704
没有坏事发生哦
Nothing bad is gonna happen now.

924
00:49:20,739 --> 00:49:23,874
没有坏事发生哦
Nothing bad is gonna happen now.

925
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:40,914
早饭当晚饭吃
Breakfast for dinner.

926
00:50:33,778 --> 00:50:35,445
去楼道走走吗
Going for a walk around the floor

927
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,457
我想走远一点
Oh, I thought I'd go a little further than that.

928
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:39,655
让我叫护理员吧
Let me call an orderly, then.

929
00:50:39,656 --> 00:50:40,403
他能带你呼吸点新鲜空气
He can take you out for some air.

930
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:45,059
不用 没事的 我儿子来接我
No, that's okay. My son's gonna pick me up.

931
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,257
我会出门几小时
I'm gonna be gone for a few hours, so...

932
00:50:47,469 --> 00:50:49,426
别等我了
don't wait up.

933
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,594
贾米森太太 你不能离开
Mrs. Jamison, you can't leave.

934
00:50:51,629 --> 00:50:55,065
你很虚弱
You're weak.

935
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,271
正是因此我才要走 法乐瑞护士
That's exactly why I have to leave, nurse Valerie.

936
00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:03,165
我要看看威尼斯
I need to see venice.

937
00:51:03,189 --> 00:51:05,518
-威尼斯 -这是个比喻 
-Venice -It's an analogy.

938
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:09,313
你说不定想去佛罗里达
For you, it might be the Florida keys

939
00:51:09,347 --> 00:51:11,281
或者肯塔基
or the Kentucky derby

940
00:51:11,316 --> 00:51:13,617
或者火腿博物馆
or the spam museum.

941
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:16,019
我建议你尽力赶去博物馆吧
And I recommend you really try and make it to the museum.

942
00:51:16,053 --> 00:51:17,654
看着不错
It looks pretty spiffy.

943
00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:21,124
我觉得你真不该走
I really don't think you should go,

944
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:24,827
尤其是没有了输液
especially without your I.V.

945
00:51:27,781 --> 00:51:29,381
走着瞧吧
Let's see.

946
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:33,111
考虑到我会死在这里 最坏的不就是
The worst that could happen is that I die out there.

947
00:51:33,337 --> 00:51:36,339
我会死在外面嘛
And considering that I'm gonna die in here,

948
00:51:36,374 --> 00:51:40,351
你们真的在乎将死之人去哪吗
do we really, honestly care where the deed goes down

949
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:43,478
我就是将死之人
And since I'm the one dying,

950
00:51:43,856 --> 00:51:45,504
我说了算
I win.

951
00:51:53,758 --> 00:51:54,837
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

952

00:52:10,758 --> 00:52:12,582
你的眼睛怎么了
What happened to your eye

960
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,105
亚当打的 我活该
Adam beat me up. Deserved it.

961
00:52:15,214 --> 00:52:17,548
对啊 他就是活该
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

962
00:52:20,456 --> 00:52:22,053
我还从来都没来过时装秀呢
I've never been to a fashion show before.

963
00:52:22,087 --> 00:52:23,686
太激动啦
It's very exciting.

964
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:25,626
我听说常常有人衣服掉了会露点
I hear sometimes the boobs fall right out of the dresses.

965
00:52:25,673 --> 00:52:26,591
模特还照走不误
They just keep on walking.

966
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:28,154
你才看不到胸呢 死心了吧
You're not gonna see boobs, okay

967
00:52:28,155 --> 00:52:29,581
可还是会好玩的吧 
Well, it's still gonna be fun, though, right

968
00:52:29,582 --> 00:52:31,029
会超赞的
It's gonna be awesome.

969
00:52:36,142 --> 00:52:37,647
哥们 你迟到了
Dude, you're late.

970
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,337
小火花丢了啦
Sparkles is missing.

971
00:52:39,372 --> 00:52:40,405
我找遍了
I... I looked everywhere.

972
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:43,542
-嗨! -嗨
-Hi! -Hi.

973
00:53:12,884 --> 00:53:15,550
好戏登场了 下一个是我的作品
Here we go. My dress is next.

974
00:53:18,812 --> 00:53:20,980
该死
Oh, shit.

975
00:53:22,979 --> 00:53:24,617

978
00:53:53,213 --> 00:53:55,614

979
00:54:02,488 --> 00:54:04,123
凯西在这干吗
What is Cathy doing up there

980
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,158
震惊走秀场啊
Rockin' the shit out of that runway.

981
00:54:20,072 --> 00:54:22,273
