1
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,200
You're always
Sick!

2
00:00:51,354 --> 00:00:53,555
You were sick
when you were my age?

3
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:57,162
Evening, sir.

4
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,263
Evening, Victor.
I didn't realize that you're still here.

5
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:06,788
I'm just keeping James company, sir.
If that's all right...

6
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:09,990
Very kind of you.

7
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:14,642
- Are you better, son?
- Still cold, father.

8
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:17,055
It's just a mild fever.
You'll be all right in the morning.

9
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,198
- You always say that.
- And you always pull through, don't you?

10
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:25,188
Now... take your medicine.

11
00:01:26,324 --> 00:01:28,043
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

12
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:29,724
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

13
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:31,603
Your father's drunk again.

14
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:33,403
You should help him home, Victor.

15
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:35,964
It's not my name he's calling, sir.

16
00:01:37,324 --> 00:01:39,484
- Father!
- Stay where you are, James!

17
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:41,325
Father!

18
00:01:44,846 --> 00:01:46,405
<i>I told you never to come back here!</i>

19
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,729
James...

20
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:17,329
There are things you
don't understand.

21
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:18,490
- Don't...
- I need him them to know!

22
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:19,129
Please no!

23
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:20,248
- No...more...lies!

24
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:21,129
James...

25
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:40,811
James!

26
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:48,932
He...he wasn't your father...

27
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:57,373
...son.

28
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:08,014
What are you?

29
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:24,936
- I didn't mean it! I didn't--
- Yes, you did!

30
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:29,896
He deserved it!
And you gave it to him.

31
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:35,377
We're brothers, Jimmy.
You realize that?

32
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:37,458
Brothers protect each other.

33
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:39,498
You have to be hard now.

34
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:42,458
Hard enough they can't ever touch us.

35
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:44,178
I want to go home.

36
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:47,458
We can't. We stick together
no matter what

37
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:50,459
and take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

38
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,179
Can you do that, little brother?

39
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,180
They're coming.
Can you run? Okay.

40
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,501
Keep on running.
Don't look back.

41
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:08,628
Back-to-back!

42
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:08,834
Enough! Enough!

43
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:24,596
Stand down, soldier!

44
00:06:38,518 --> 00:06:40,477
Stand down!

45
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:44,999
Victor, no!

46
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,581
Ready!

47
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:12,982
Aim!

48
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:15,021
Wake me when it's over.

49
00:07:20,782 --> 00:07:21,863
Fire!

50
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:35,504
My name is Major William Stryker.

51
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:38,784
You were sentenced to death
for decapitating a senior officer.

52
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,504
Is that correct?

53
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:42,745
Apparently we have some
issues with authority.

54
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:43,944
Just keep a lid on it.

55
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:45,705
Sir.

56
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:48,626
The warden tells me that your sentence
was carried out

57
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:50,826
by a firing squad at 1000 hours

58
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:53,907
- How'd that go?
- It tickled.

59
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:00,347
You boys tired of running?

60
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:03,107
Tired of denying your...true nature?

61
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:05,428
- What do you care?
- Oh, I care...

62
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:08,148
I care cause I know
how special you are,

63
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,228
how valuable.

64
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:15,068
Look.

65
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:18,868
You can stay here, locked up
like freaks of nature,

66
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:21,549
or you can join me.

67
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:26,590
I'm putting together a special team
with special privileges.

68
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,390
Now tell me. How would you like
to really serve your country?

69
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:47,111
I love this weapon more than anything
in the whole wide world.

70
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:48,432
- You wanna know why?
- No.

71
00:08:49,592 --> 00:08:51,273
It's memorable.

72
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:53,832
Sure, it's a little bulky,
to have to get 'em on a plane.

73
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:56,834
You whip out a couple of swords
at your ex-girlfriend's wedding,

74
00:08:56,914 --> 00:08:59,393
they will never, ever forget it.

75
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:03,234
That's funny, Wade.
I didn't think you liked girls.

76
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:07,594
Right, it is...it's probably not
as intimidating as having a gun or

77
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,435
bone claws or the fingernails
of a bag lady...

78
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:23,436
- Manicure?
- Victor...easy.

79
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:26,757
Speaking of sharp,
Fred got a new tattoo.

80
00:09:26,837 --> 00:09:30,717
- I'm concerned.
- Oh geez, Fred, you just met her last night.

81
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,676
- I love her.
- You love her after one night?

82
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:36,357
She's a gymnast.

83
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:38,757
Bradley, take her down.

84
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:45,718
Are you gonna puke?

85
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,439
If we were meant to fly,
we'd have grown wings.

86
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,999
Oh, don't worry man. See, more people
die driving than flying.

87
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,038
How about from impaling?

88
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,040
Hey, be nice.
Or your approximation of nice.

89
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,000
Would you like a bucket?

90
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,961
Gentlemen, wheels down
in Lagos in five.

91
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:39,044
- Why are we here?
- All in good time. Zero...

92
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:22,929
- Victor, high ground lookout.
- Having fun yet?

93
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,130
- Fred...
- Tank?

94
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,291
- Tank.
- Yeah, I got that.

95
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:08,055
Great!

96
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,895
Stuck in an elevator with five guys
on a high protein diet.

97
00:12:11,015 --> 00:12:12,575
- Oh Wade!
- Dreams really do come true.

98
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:14,495
Would you just shut it!
You're up next.

99
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:16,735
Thank you, sir.
You look very nice today.

100
00:12:16,815 --> 00:12:17,655
It's the green.

101
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:19,376
Brings out the seriousness in your eyes.

102
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:23,016
- Oh my God, do you ever shut up, pal?
- No. Not when I'm awake.

103
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:26,616
Bradley? Top floor, please.

104
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:36,097
Cover the elevator!
The elevator!

105
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:47,979
Time to go to work.

106
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:24,262
Okay!

107
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:26,423
People are dead!

108
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:31,904
If you haven't that mouth on you, Wade,
you'd be the perfect soldier.

109
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:46,786
Take the diamonds, they're yours.

110
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:48,265
I don't want your diamonds.

111
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:50,705
I want this.

112
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,986
That? That is nothing. A souvenir.

113
00:13:55,106 --> 00:13:58,387
Where did you find it?
I want the source.

114
00:13:58,786 --> 00:14:04,268
A small village, far inland,
three days from here.

115
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:09,668
Tell him that this rock is more valuable
to me than his life.

116
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:10,987
Ask him where he found it.

117
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:26,230
He says it came from the sky.

118
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,670
He's telling the truth.

119
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,631
- You don't know their language, Logan.
- It's a meteor fragment.

120
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,392
I know what it is.
I'm asking him where he found it.

121
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,231
Sir, base wants to know our location.

122
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:42,231
Shut him down.

123
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:50,273
Tell him everyone here will die unless
he tells me where he found the rock.

124
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:03,353
- He said that is sacred.
- Okay, fine.

125
00:15:06,635 --> 00:15:08,354
Victor...

126
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:25,916
Victor!

127
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:30,637
Don't even think about it!

128
00:15:32,356 --> 00:15:33,797
We didn't sign up for this.

129
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,118
Put him down.

130
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:53,400
What are you doing?

131
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,720
We finally got a good thing going here.
Don't you screw this up.

132
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,519
- Enough, it's enough. We've done enough.
- Who do you think you are?

133
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,000
This is what we do.

134
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,401
Maybe you'd rather be rotting
in a hole somewhere

135
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:07,280
till they figure out a way
to do it to us, is that it?

136
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:08,441
Uh?

137
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,122
I'm done.

138
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:15,801
You coming?

139
00:16:21,082 --> 00:16:22,883
Jimmy!

140
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:29,083
We can't just let you walk away!

141
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:39,605
Jimmy!

142
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:43,805
Jimmy!

143
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,850
Why are you up so early?

144
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:37,011
Come here.

145
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:15,295
See you baby.

146
00:18:23,697 --> 00:18:25,775
Oh, that's nice! Yeah!

147
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,340
No. Come on.

148
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:13,381
Hey, what do you do?

149
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,461
You turn off the light, you win a prize.

150
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:20,702
- Two tries for a buck.
- Come on, I wanna do it!

151
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:29,623
Um, that's obvious.

152
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:35,143
That's two.

153
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:47,385
- That's a stupid trick.
- It's not a trick, man.

154
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:49,425
C'mon.

155
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:52,666
Bye!

156
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,829
Show's over!

157
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:29,230
I said, show's over!

158
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,591
The show is never over for us, Bradley.

159
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,511
- Victor.
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?

160
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:45,672
Yeah, come on in.

161
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:58,833
You know, I've never said anything

162
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:02,194
to anyone...about what happened.

163
00:21:02,874 --> 00:21:05,434
I'm living a totally different life now,
but uh...

164
00:21:05,554 --> 00:21:07,633
No need to bring up the past.

165
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,275
You know,

166
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:28,237
I always thought it would be Wade
coming knocking at my door.

167
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:34,158
Well, Wade's gone.

168
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:40,438
I'm not afraid of you, Victor.

169
00:21:42,397 --> 00:21:44,398
I'm not afraid to die.

170
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:50,359
How do you know?
You've never tried it before.

171
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:09,761
Was it the wars?

172
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,202
- Which one?
- All of 'em.

173
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,723
Tell me.

174
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:27,083
It's just a scratch.

175
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:36,404
Looks like we're gonna need
new sheets again, baby.

176
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:38,085
Yeah...

177
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:03,847
Who the hell is this?

178
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,007
It smells like government.

179
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,129
My God!
Haven't aged a day!

180
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:13,808
Clean living.

181
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:15,608
You remember Agent Zero.

182
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,129
Still shooting first and
asking questions later?

183
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:21,849
You still chewing those cheap cigars?

184
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:26,129
Boys, please.
I have a job for you.

185
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:28,450
- I already have a job.
- Lumberjack.

186
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,730
- Eighteen grand a year?
- Eighteen five.

187
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,890
Plus I haven't had
to kill anyone in a while.

188
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,010
- Start to miss it?
- Yeah, right now I am.

189
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,810
Zero, back to the car.

190
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:41,692
Attaboy.

191
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:51,172
You know, I'm not proud about the way
things ended between us.

192
00:23:51,252 --> 00:23:53,013
Conversation's over.

193
00:23:54,412 --> 00:23:57,413
Play the little house on the prairie
with a...a school teacher.

194
00:23:58,214 --> 00:23:59,494
That's just isn't you, Logan.

195
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:01,254
And you would know, huh?

196
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,093
I would.

197
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:04,654
What do you want, Stryker?

198
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:08,414
Bradley was killed three days ago.

199
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:12,454
Wade, before that.

200
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,535
I believe that someone is
hunting down our whole team.

201
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,095
Anyone else?

202
00:24:18,215 --> 00:24:20,775
As far as I know,
Victor is safe.

203
00:24:22,136 --> 00:24:26,496
- Whoever it is, he's had names, addresses...
- I can take care of myself.

204
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:30,497
This is not about you, Logan.

205
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:36,017
Country needs you.

206
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:38,457
I am Canadian.

207
00:24:39,498 --> 00:24:42,418
I know you, Logan!
I know who you are!

208
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:20,383
What's wrong?

209
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:23,662
Stryker came by today.

210
00:25:25,143 --> 00:25:26,422
Don't worry, I said no.

211
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:29,183
Why is he bothering you
after all these years?

212
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:31,864
Because I'm the best
there is at what I do.

213
00:25:31,944 --> 00:25:33,864
And what I do best
isn't very nice.

214
00:25:33,944 --> 00:25:36,865
You're not an animal, Logan.
What you have is a gift.

215
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:40,744
A gift? You can return a gift.

216
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:54,387
Come on, fellas!

217
00:25:57,026 --> 00:26:01,226
- Stay in the car.
- I'm just gonna ask nicely.

218
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:07,347
Mind lettin' us go by?

219
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:08,948
You're in some kind of
a hurry there, pal?

220
00:26:09,388 --> 00:26:10,148
Are ya?

221
00:26:10,788 --> 00:26:14,148
- Just move your truck so we can go by...
- Trying to have a conversation there, right!

222
00:26:14,228 --> 00:26:17,109
If you start something,
you'd better be ready to finish it.

223
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,108
Hey guys, take it easy!

224
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:27,109
- Your boyfriend's got a big mouth.
- I know.

225
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:31,950
Big temper too,
so please, let us pass.

226
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,471
Thank you!

227
00:26:40,352 --> 00:26:41,711
How did you do that?

228
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:44,591
You know, power of persuasion is a gift.

229
00:26:44,991 --> 00:26:48,071
I see...
Do you, uh, have those powers over me?

230
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:51,352
Well, you didn't stay in the car, did you?

231
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:09,555
Why is the moon so lonely?

232
00:27:10,634 --> 00:27:12,035
Why?

233
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:14,555
Because she used to have a lover.

234
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:16,874
- You tell this to the kids?
- No.

235
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:20,916
His name was Kuekuatsheu and they lived
in the spirit world together.

236
00:27:20,996 --> 00:27:23,115
Ah, it's a true story.
Right.

237
00:27:23,756 --> 00:27:27,317
And every night,
they would wander the skies together.

238
00:27:27,956 --> 00:27:32,197
But...one of the other spirits
was jealous.

239
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,677
Trickster, one of the moons from South,

240
00:27:35,757 --> 00:27:39,637
so he told Kuekuatsheu
that the moon had asked for flowers.

241
00:27:39,997 --> 00:27:43,559
He told him to come to our world
and pick up some wild roses,

242
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,519
But Kuekuatsheu didn't know
that once you leave the spirit world,

243
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:50,918
you can never go back.

244
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:56,919
And every night, he looks up in the sky
and sees the moon and howls her name.

245
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,921
But...

246
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,960
...he can never touch her again.

247
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,961
Koo-koo-Kachooka got screwed.

248
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:14,201
Kuekuatsheu.

249
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,842
Means the Wolverine.

250
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:22,770
What you're doing, Logan?

251
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:17,295
Kayla!

252
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:20,782
You're not from around here, are you?

253
00:31:25,462 --> 00:31:27,183
What gave me away?

254
00:31:31,383 --> 00:31:34,583
- You got an insurance in this place?
- Insurance?

255
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,903
No.

256
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:38,624
Too bad.

257
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:56,466
Well, well, well...
Look what the cat dragged in.

258
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,706
Guys, whatever this is,
take it outside.

259
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:13,868
- Why?
- Why?

260
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:20,869
You don't call,
you don't write.

261
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:25,429
How else am I supposed to get your attention?

262
00:33:02,674 --> 00:33:06,954
I hate to say it, James,
but, frankly, I'm a little disappointed.

263
00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:09,993
Stay down.

264
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:50,919
Tell me some, Jimmy, was she worth it?

265
00:34:10,942 --> 00:34:16,381
When are you gonna figure it out?
we are not like them.

266
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:26,023
- I...am nothing like you.
- Sure you are. You just don't know it yet.

267
00:34:38,864 --> 00:34:41,424
- What do we got?
- Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds.

268
00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:46,026
What? Is this a joke?
The guy's fine.

269
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:47,544
Where is he?

270
00:34:47,664 --> 00:34:48,224
I said where is he!

271
00:34:48,305 --> 00:34:49,145
I don't know who he is.

272
00:34:49,265 --> 00:34:51,706
I can help you.

273
00:34:57,147 --> 00:35:01,067
Six years I've been here. No one
knew me and then you show up!

274
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:04,266
- And the next day, she's dead!
- I tried to warn you.

275
00:35:04,346 --> 00:35:07,187
- Why don't you tell me it was Victor?
- I didn't know!

276
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:14,349
I swear on my son's life! I didn't...

277
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:23,369
Victor's appetites were
becoming too public.

278
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,690
I had to lock him up.
He thought I'd betrayed him.

279
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,850
Went AWOL.
He said he was coming after all of us.

280
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,409
You didn't come to warn me.
You came to save your own ass.

281
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,130
So what's your plan, captain?

282
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,890
You can't beat him, Logan,
you know you can't.

283
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,851
I'm gonna find him and kill him.

284
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:44,611
I can give you the tools to defeat him.

285
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:53,612
- So we can still save the others.
- You mean save yourself, right?

286
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:56,652
I promise you two things:

287
00:35:56,772 --> 00:35:59,733
You'll suffer more pain than
any other man can endure,

288
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:02,213
but you'll have your revenge.

289
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:08,093
If I come with you, I'm coming for blood.

290
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:12,095
No law, no code of conduct.

291
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:16,375
You point me in the right direction
and you get the hell out of my way.

292
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,379
When it starts,

293
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:58,940
whatever the reason is
that you're doing this,

294
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,020
focus on that. Maybe it will help.

295
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,581
Trust me, I've been through worse.

296
00:37:04,661 --> 00:37:06,020
No you haven't.

297
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:08,301
We are ready.

298
00:37:10,342 --> 00:37:15,181
We're gonna make you indestructible,
but first, we're gonna have to destroy you.

299
00:37:18,021 --> 00:37:21,423
Remember what we were
looking for in Africa?

300
00:37:21,503 --> 00:37:22,343
I remember.

301
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:23,222
Well, I found it.

302
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:29,342
It helped us create a...
metal compound so strong

303
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:32,263
that you will be able to
withstand virtually anything.

304
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,903
It's called Adamantium.

305
00:37:35,783 --> 00:37:38,785
I can't put Victor down myself, Logan.

306
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:44,184
To kill him, you're gonna have to
embrace the other side,

307
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,745
become the animal.

308
00:37:49,505 --> 00:37:51,026
Let's do this.

309
00:37:51,745 --> 00:37:53,065
I almost forgot.

310
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:58,226
I want new ones.

311
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,346
What do you want them to say?

312
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:03,506
Wolverine.

313
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:22,869
Generals! Welcome.

314
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:24,829
General Munson.

315
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,870
Today, we're gonna witness
medical history.

316
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,229
- Today, we're gonna create Weapon X.
- X?

317
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:35,350
Roman numeral, Ten.

318
00:38:36,671 --> 00:38:41,551
We are about to begin bonding
Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton

319
00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:43,512
Let's begin.

320
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:30,116
<i>- We're brothers, Jimmy.
- Logan!</i>

321
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:32,557
Body temperature is 1-0-8
and rising.

322
00:39:35,558 --> 00:39:38,077
Why is he thrashinglike that?
Why isn't he sedated?

323
00:39:38,157 --> 00:39:41,517
He feels pain, just like the rest of us.
Anesthesia won't work on him.

324
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:43,318
That's why he had to volunteer.

325
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:45,318
195.

326
00:39:45,518 --> 00:39:47,159
- Will he survive this?
- I don't know.

327
00:39:47,278 --> 00:39:48,799
200.

328
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:52,159
<i>...son.</i>

329
00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:55,079
Heartbeat is close to maximum.

330
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,400
- Blood pressure?
- 260 on 180.

331
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,839
He can make it, he can make it.

332
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:05,640
<i>Victor!</i>

333
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,481
<i>I love you.</i>

334
00:40:12,601 --> 00:40:14,561
<i>You're not an animal, Logan.</i>

335
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,843
<i>It means the Volverine.</i>

336
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,566
I guess he can die.

337
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:21,969
Come on, old friend.
Come back.

338
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,209
Heart rate rising.

339
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,010
Adamantium reservoir is depleted.

340
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,490
No rejection.
Procedure completed.

341
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,850
We did it!

342
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:44,332
We take him to the island?

343
00:41:44,651 --> 00:41:47,252
The island? No.

344
00:41:48,012 --> 00:41:52,772
<i>The bonding works.
We use his DNA for the XI.</i>

345
00:41:54,772 --> 00:41:56,933
Erase his memory.

346
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:01,813
<i>Fry his brain!</i>

347
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,414
I think he heard you.

348
00:42:27,456 --> 00:42:29,096
Lockdown!

349
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,580
Hunt him down.
Take his head off.

350
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:48,746
Travis!

351
00:43:55,745 --> 00:43:59,666
I think there is some
naked man in the barn.

352
00:43:59,746 --> 00:44:00,547
Yep.

353
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:33,390
Son...

354
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,351
What in hell are you doing?

355
00:44:35,751 --> 00:44:38,911
- It's cold.
- Cold?

356
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:47,152
- You got no clothes on.
- Yeah.

357
00:44:47,232 --> 00:44:49,912
- You're not onto drugs, are you?
- No.

358
00:44:51,192 --> 00:44:54,232
- Hmm. You just had a rough night.
- Yeah, you could say that.

359
00:44:57,712 --> 00:44:59,352
Come on up the house.

360
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:02,753
Some of my son's old clothes
will probably fit you.

361
00:45:03,593 --> 00:45:05,953
Here, cover it up with that.

362
00:45:06,313 --> 00:45:09,194
I don't want to give an old lady
a heart attack.

363
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:54,479
You're right in there?

364
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,960
Yeah, everything's fine.

365
00:45:57,399 --> 00:46:01,040
- Supper's on the table.
- I uh...Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

366
00:46:12,321 --> 00:46:14,481
I swear I'm gonna pay for it.

367
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:17,962
Set it down over there.

368
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:24,482
Come and sit down, son.

369
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:32,963
I can't thank you both enough
...for everything

370
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:35,723
It wouldn't have been decent
to leave you out there to freeze.

371
00:46:36,164 --> 00:46:38,963
- Decent...
- What?

372
00:46:39,284 --> 00:46:42,925
Um... Nothing, I'm just not
really used to that word.

373
00:46:45,565 --> 00:46:48,286
- That's a nice chopper you've got out there.
- You know motorcycle?

374
00:46:48,366 --> 00:46:50,125
Oh Lord, here we go!

375
00:46:50,205 --> 00:46:51,445
My favorite is a '48 Panhead.

376
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:52,685
I bought one new off the line.

377
00:46:52,765 --> 00:46:55,325
I think you're a little young
for that, son.

378
00:46:55,405 --> 00:46:58,406
You must be exhausted.
You get a good night's sleep.

379
00:46:58,526 --> 00:47:00,247
In the barn.

380
00:47:00,966 --> 00:47:03,207
Nothing you can break out there.

381
00:47:16,008 --> 00:47:17,409
<i>I love you.</i>

382
00:47:18,408 --> 00:47:21,209
<i>- Why is the moon so lonely?
- Why?</i>

383
00:47:22,729 --> 00:47:25,209
<i>Because she used to have a lover.</i>

384
00:47:27,129 --> 00:47:29,729
<i>He can never touch her again.</i>

385
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:49,052
You sleep ok?

386
00:47:51,092 --> 00:47:52,533
Uh...yeah.

387
00:47:54,653 --> 00:47:58,652
You look like a man fixing
to do a bad thing.

388
00:48:00,213 --> 00:48:03,654
You know what happens
to many looking for blood?

389
00:48:03,974 --> 00:48:07,654
- What?
- They find it.

390
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:13,734
- We all got a choice, son.
- Yeah, mine got taken.

391
00:48:13,814 --> 00:48:15,655
Bullshit.

392
00:48:19,255 --> 00:48:21,456
This was my son's jacket.

393
00:48:23,336 --> 00:48:24,856
Try it on.

394
00:48:39,857 --> 00:48:43,538
- Thank you.
- Yep...

395
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:48,778
You wanna take my bike for a spin,
test the suspension.

396
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:52,019
'64, huh?

397
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:57,780
- Man, you're heavy.
- Yeah, I put on a little weight recently.

398
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,660
Good morning.

399
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:59,739
Good morning.

400
00:49:03,019 --> 00:49:05,180
Oh, it fits you beautifully!

401
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:07,940
I brought you some...

402
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:19,222
<i>Weapon X is in the barn.
He just murdered two civilians.</i>

403
00:49:19,302 --> 00:49:22,422
Blow him to bits.
Let's see if he can survive that.

404
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:36,024
<i>Fire at will.</i>

405
00:49:44,745 --> 00:49:45,945
Come and get me!

406
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,026
Blow his head up.

407
00:50:00,426 --> 00:50:01,627
Damn!

408
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:38,190
Alpha One, do not lose him!

409
00:50:46,151 --> 00:50:48,272
<i>Alfa 2, target's coming to you!</i>

410
00:51:37,658 --> 00:51:39,417
Pull up! Pull up!

411
00:52:44,325 --> 00:52:46,165
<i>Zero, is Logan dead?</i>

412
00:52:46,165 --> 00:52:47,724
Don't know, I'm down.

413
00:52:57,667 --> 00:52:59,386
<i>Zero, come in!</i>

414
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:05,166
<i>You tried to kill me.</i>

415
00:53:05,606 --> 00:53:06,607
Logan?

416
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:07,847
Where is Victor?

417
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:09,688
Come back to base.

418
00:53:09,808 --> 00:53:11,727
I'll explain everything,
we'll take Victor down together.

419
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,288
<i>Wrong answer.</i>

420
00:53:13,368 --> 00:53:15,929
After I've killed Victor,
I'm coming for you.

421
00:53:18,568 --> 00:53:20,488
<i>Logan, listen to me.</i>

422
00:53:20,569 --> 00:53:22,968
If you go down this road, you're
not gonna like what you find.

423
00:53:24,089 --> 00:53:28,129
You wanted the animal, Colonel?
You got it.

424
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:34,929
Those were good people back there.

425
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,170
Innocent people.

426
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:46,491
It's funny how good innocent people
tend to die around you.

427
00:54:09,774 --> 00:54:12,134
Zero never stood a chance.

428
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:15,815
The only thing that'll take him down
is an Adamantium bullet

429
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:25,695
This facility is compromised.
Prep transport.

430
00:54:34,497 --> 00:54:36,178
Colonel, this is turning into a disaster.

431
00:54:36,658 --> 00:54:38,777
- Don't worry, we'll stop him.
- Really?

432
00:54:38,897 --> 00:54:41,978
You've just spent half a billion
dollars making him indestructible.

433
00:54:45,058 --> 00:54:46,378
- Sir?
- Yes.

434
00:54:46,498 --> 00:54:49,418
The young mutant you've been looking for?
We found him.

435
00:54:49,898 --> 00:54:52,419
General, Logan isn't the only
piece in this puzzle.

436
00:54:52,499 --> 00:54:56,299
I need to evacuate this facility.
Please, go back to Washington.

437
00:54:56,499 --> 00:54:57,779
We've got work to do.

438
00:55:00,299 --> 00:55:03,820
Yo hablo: I talk,
tu hablas: you talk, el habla?

439
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,341
Somebody translate?

440
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,340
Summers?

441
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:10,140
Sit up and take off those glasses.

442
00:55:11,261 --> 00:55:13,421
I have a headache.

443
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:16,061
Then you can wear them
in detention after school

444
00:55:16,142 --> 00:55:18,661
whil you add up
this conjugation 100 times.

445
00:55:19,262 --> 00:55:20,102
Somebody else?

446
00:55:20,222 --> 00:55:21,102
<i>He talks.</i>

447
00:55:21,222 --> 00:55:23,183
Thank you, he talks.
El habla.

448
00:55:34,184 --> 00:55:36,384
- You sure it was Victor?
- Yeah.

449
00:55:37,304 --> 00:55:39,465
Damn!

450
00:55:39,585 --> 00:55:41,503
I'm sorry, mate.

451
00:55:43,744 --> 00:55:46,025
What the hell happened
to him after I left?

452
00:55:46,145 --> 00:55:46,904
He got worse.

453
00:55:47,304 --> 00:55:49,145
He felt like you abandoned him.

454
00:55:49,265 --> 00:55:50,986
Hell, we all do.

455
00:55:51,106 --> 00:55:54,666
But Victor, he had to prove you
he was better than you.

456
00:55:54,746 --> 00:55:57,387
Hunting and killing
everything's he was pointin' at.

457
00:55:57,666 --> 00:56:01,586
Quit a few months later myself,
couldn't take rounding them up.

458
00:56:02,547 --> 00:56:05,226
- Rounding who up?
- Leave it alone.

459
00:56:05,307 --> 00:56:07,187
Rounding who up, John?

460
00:56:07,747 --> 00:56:09,667
Hey! God damn it, John!

461
00:56:09,747 --> 00:56:11,988
We hunted our own kind, Logan.

462
00:56:12,188 --> 00:56:14,628
There's a special place in hell
for the things we did.

463
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:15,507
Mutants?

464
00:56:16,948 --> 00:56:18,228
Why?

465
00:56:18,428 --> 00:56:20,909
Stryker'd say we would
make a difference.

466
00:56:21,228 --> 00:56:23,829
Protecting people from the bad ones.

467
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,789
How are you gonna take
Victor down, Logan?

468
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:30,751
- Remember that stuff in Africa?
- Yeah, I remember Africa, what about it?

469
00:56:34,831 --> 00:56:36,032
Damn!

470
00:56:37,431 --> 00:56:38,911
What'd they do to you?

471
00:56:39,511 --> 00:56:40,871
Don't ask.

472
00:56:43,351 --> 00:56:46,552
Listen, Zero said something about an island.
Does that mean anything to you?

473
00:56:46,632 --> 00:56:47,593
Nope.

474
00:56:47,673 --> 00:56:49,152
But maybe Dukes knows.

475
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,193
- Him and Zero were real tight.
- Fred Dukes?

476
00:56:51,313 --> 00:56:52,473
- Where is he?
- He's here.

477
00:56:52,593 --> 00:56:54,394
- Well, let's go talk to him.
- Hold on.

478
00:56:54,474 --> 00:56:56,233
He don't get in until around four.

479
00:56:56,313 --> 00:56:59,354
But I gotta warn you,
he developed a bit of eating desorder.

480
00:56:59,474 --> 00:57:02,954
We all got our coping mechanisms.
I'm trying to whoop him back into shape.

481
00:57:07,195 --> 00:57:09,435
Come on, Fred, if you want to get
into shape, you gotta move, man.

482
00:57:09,516 --> 00:57:10,595
I told him he got to move.

483
00:57:15,636 --> 00:57:18,075
Fred Dukes? **** this creature?
That ain't Fred.

484
00:57:18,196 --> 00:57:20,236
If you want his help,
don't mention it to him.

485
00:57:21,637 --> 00:57:23,756
Hey, Fat, Fred, um.

486
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:27,157
I don't remember that girl
puttin' up eighty five pounds, huh.

487
00:57:29,236 --> 00:57:32,557
Oh that's funny.
You're still so funny, Logan.

488
00:57:32,638 --> 00:57:34,677
You know where Victor is?

489
00:57:34,757 --> 00:57:35,678
No idea.

490
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:37,838
What's the island, slim?

491
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:41,839
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out, Logan.

492
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:45,598
Listen, I ain't gonna leave
until you tell me where Victor is.

493
00:57:45,718 --> 00:57:48,119
Come on, Bob. For old times' sake, huh?

494
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,319
Did you just call me...Blob?

495
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,040
No, but...

496
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,160
I told you not to mention his weight.
Why did you call him Blob?

497
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,641
I didn't call him Blob, I said Bob!

498
00:58:05,721 --> 00:58:07,362
Goddamn it!

499
00:58:07,802 --> 00:58:09,121
I got an idea.

500
00:58:10,722 --> 00:58:13,002
- This is your idea of an idea?
- Trying to help you out, Logan.

501
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:14,881
Dukes don't like you that much,
and you know it.

502
00:58:15,001 --> 00:58:16,082
The feeling is mutual.

503
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:18,482
Use those gloves, man,
dance with him a little bit.

504
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:20,602
Allow him to let his anger out on you.

505
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,843
I figure if you do that
he might tell you all you wanna know.

506
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,764
Come on, man, look at him.

507
00:58:25,884 --> 00:58:28,204
Big old ass comin' out of
the front of his shirt.

508
00:58:28,484 --> 00:58:30,964
Jesus, he's gonna have a coronary
for Christ's sake.

509
00:58:31,084 --> 00:58:33,564
Is there even a stretcher big enough
to take this guy out of here?

510
00:58:35,324 --> 00:58:37,405
It ain't him I'm worried about
getting out on a stretcher.

511
00:58:37,604 --> 00:58:38,844
You're an asshole.

512
00:58:41,966 --> 00:58:42,806
Whoop his ass!

513
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,926
- Let me have it.
- If you want.

514
00:58:46,006 --> 00:58:48,166
Be careful with this.
You wanna dance with me?

515
00:58:48,486 --> 00:58:49,965
Oh. Oh, that feels good.

516
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:55,566
Hey, guess what?

517
00:58:56,647 --> 00:58:59,047
See, he's gonna talk, man.
You got him right where you want him.

518
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:00,608
Whose side are you on, anyway?

519
00:59:34,412 --> 00:59:36,330
Now, where is Victor?

520
01:00:05,855 --> 01:00:08,494
A little dark for sunglasses,
don't you think?

521
01:00:23,616 --> 01:00:26,337
Please don't! Please! Don't, please!

522
01:00:26,417 --> 01:00:27,976
Victor!

523
01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:34,017
Where's Victor?

524
01:00:36,418 --> 01:00:42,378
Victor's... with Stryker on...
on the island, they run it together.

525
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:45,378
What...what?

526
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:47,339
Victor's being with Stryker?

527
01:00:47,419 --> 01:00:48,779
Yeah.

528
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:50,460
You didn't know that?

529
01:01:10,382 --> 01:01:12,342
All that's left now is Logan, I...

530
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:15,382
...trust you can handle that.

531
01:01:15,822 --> 01:01:17,662
I did before, didn't I?

532
01:01:17,782 --> 01:01:19,982
Oh yes, you did that.

533
01:01:22,423 --> 01:01:26,664
Our deal...it still applies, right?

534
01:01:27,943 --> 01:01:29,023
Of course.

535
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:31,623
Now pack him
and tag him, Captain.

536
01:01:39,465 --> 01:01:41,426
What's the island?

537
01:01:41,546 --> 01:01:46,345
It's where... Striker takes them
after Victor's caught 'em.

538
01:01:46,785 --> 01:01:49,625
Wait, wait...um, what?
Takes who?

539
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,466
Mutants.

540
01:01:52,827 --> 01:01:57,387
The rumor is that Stryker's doing
experiments on them there.

541
01:01:59,548 --> 01:02:01,827
Well, you never wondered
what happened to them?

542
01:02:01,907 --> 01:02:04,107
I tried no to.

543
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:23,829
They killed her so I'd let them
put Adamantium in me.

544
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,271
They killed her for a
goddamn experiment.

545
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:34,111
Where is it?

546
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:36,911
Logan, Stryker kept it real secret.

547
01:02:40,711 --> 01:02:42,832
But...

548
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:45,833
- A prisoner escaped there once.
- Who?

549
01:02:45,953 --> 01:02:46,832
His name is Remy LeBeau.

550
01:02:46,992 --> 01:02:49,112
He was a street hustler from New Orleans.

551
01:02:49,392 --> 01:02:51,433
The guards at the prison
called him Gambit

552
01:02:51,513 --> 01:02:54,473
'cause he kept taking all their
money at poker, that's all I know.

553
01:02:54,593 --> 01:02:56,954
What's Stryker up to,
what's the end game?

554
01:02:59,354 --> 01:03:03,315
He's taking their powers,
trying to combine them somehow.

555
01:03:03,674 --> 01:03:05,954
It's all I know, Logan.
It's all I know.

556
01:03:07,234 --> 01:03:10,194
If I had to come back here,
I'm gonna take your head off.

557
01:03:14,276 --> 01:03:15,755
I'm coming with you, Logan.

558
01:03:17,676 --> 01:03:20,117
- There's no redemption where I'm going.
- I ain't asking.

559
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:57,960
There's our dude.

560
01:04:04,281 --> 01:04:05,842
That's cool.

561
01:04:06,282 --> 01:04:08,402
But I'm gonna gonna go and cover
the back if he runs.

562
01:04:08,482 --> 01:04:09,681
I'm not havin' a fight with him.

563
01:04:09,761 --> 01:04:11,241
- Yeah right.
- What?

564
01:04:11,322 --> 01:04:12,602
I am havin' fights with everybody?

565
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:14,602
Don't dogs kill cats?

566
01:04:14,722 --> 01:04:16,602
Just go cover the back, will ya?

567
01:04:28,523 --> 01:04:31,243
Are you Remy LeBeau?

568
01:04:32,444 --> 01:04:34,004
Do I owe you money?

569
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:35,405
No.

570
01:04:36,404 --> 01:04:38,405
Then Remy LeBeau I am.

571
01:04:56,007 --> 01:04:58,847
Large blind is 100,
and the small blind's 50.

572
01:04:59,686 --> 01:05:01,487
May I deal you in?

573
01:05:01,567 --> 01:05:03,688
Now what can I get for 17 bucks?

574
01:05:04,608 --> 01:05:06,488
17 dollars?

575
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:09,129
A cab ride home, perhaps.

576
01:05:13,528 --> 01:05:15,809
You're my brother's new babysitter, John?

577
01:05:17,008 --> 01:05:18,689
I ain't Bradley, Victor.

578
01:05:18,769 --> 01:05:20,489
And your creepy black
coat don't scare me.

579
01:05:20,569 --> 01:05:21,970
Really?

580
01:05:22,329 --> 01:05:23,690
It worked on Dukes.

581
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:27,651
What a shame, 'cause now I'm gonna kill you
so Logan never gets the chance.

582
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:31,290
So what brings you to our fair city, sir?

583
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,291
Victor Creed.

584
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:36,531
And who's that?

585
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:39,411
The man I'm gonna kill.

586
01:05:40,731 --> 01:05:43,893
He works for a man named Stryker
on, uh, on an island.

587
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:48,052
- I just need to know where it is.
- Why would you think I know that?

588
01:05:48,332 --> 01:05:50,972
Well, 'cause I know who you are, Gambit.

589
01:05:52,012 --> 01:05:56,094
You are the guy who escaped and you are
the guy who's gonna take me back there.

590
01:05:57,893 --> 01:05:59,574
You know, John...

591
01:05:59,654 --> 01:06:01,614
There's something I always
wanted to tell you.

592
01:06:06,855 --> 01:06:09,214
You're predictable.

593
01:06:12,856 --> 01:06:15,295
I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy.

594
01:06:16,016 --> 01:06:19,016
That's funny.
I never knew you had one.

595
01:06:22,096 --> 01:06:25,736
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

596
01:06:26,736 --> 01:06:29,777
The men who took me
wore tags just like 'em.

597
01:06:33,138 --> 01:06:35,097
Hey, now Bob, you listen to me...

598
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:10,982
Two years I was rottin' in that hell,
and I'm never going back.

599
01:07:13,622 --> 01:07:16,102
Oh, shiny.

600
01:07:18,182 --> 01:07:20,103
Tell me something, Jimmy.

601
01:07:20,863 --> 01:07:22,983
Do you even know how to kill me?

602
01:07:23,103 --> 01:07:25,543
I'm gonna cut your goddamn head off.

603
01:07:26,383 --> 01:07:28,264
See if that works.

604
01:07:37,545 --> 01:07:39,144
You're gettin' slow, old man.

605
01:07:48,186 --> 01:07:50,426
Son of a bitch.

606
01:07:53,827 --> 01:07:56,306
You're gonna die for
what you did to her.

607
01:08:19,549 --> 01:08:20,910
Victor!

608
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:32,111
That's a nice stick.

609
01:09:28,757 --> 01:09:30,636
Shithead. Here's the deal.

610
01:09:30,836 --> 01:09:32,997
See, you're gonna take me to this
island, where I can kill Creed,

611
01:09:33,077 --> 01:09:35,718
Stryker, pretty much everyone
you hate in this world.

612
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:37,557
Do you understand?

613
01:09:38,878 --> 01:09:40,198
You really want to kill 'em.

614
01:09:40,278 --> 01:09:42,558
As long as you stay
out of my way, yeah.

615
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,320
Colonel.

616
01:09:58,401 --> 01:09:59,440
General?

617
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,841
Is this Weapon XI?

618
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,040
All their strenghts
but none of their weaknesses.

619
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,081
You really hate them, don't you?

620
01:10:08,401 --> 01:10:10,162
No, I don't hate them.

621
01:10:10,282 --> 01:10:13,562
After 20 years of working with them,
I just know what they can do.

622
01:10:18,042 --> 01:10:21,883
If we win this war before it starts,
and save countless lives in the process.

623
01:10:22,003 --> 01:10:24,963
Preemptive action is
the only action here, General.

624
01:10:25,483 --> 01:10:29,443
The days of our country sitting
on the sidelines are over.

625
01:10:30,044 --> 01:10:33,445
We need to take the fight to the enemy
before they take the fight to us.

626
01:10:34,005 --> 01:10:36,764
- I admire your passion, I do.
- Thank you.

627
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:40,204
But this is as far as it goes.

628
01:10:40,524 --> 01:10:42,645
Weapon X was a... a hickup.

629
01:10:42,725 --> 01:10:44,406
We know about your son, Bill.

630
01:10:44,526 --> 01:10:46,165
We know he's a mutant.

631
01:10:46,245 --> 01:10:49,246
And we know he killed your wife.
You shouldn't have kept that from us.

632
01:10:49,326 --> 01:10:50,767
That...

633
01:10:52,405 --> 01:10:55,246
- That has nothing to do with my work.
- Bullshit!

634
01:10:55,726 --> 01:10:58,807
You're too close to this.
I'm sure you know it.

635
01:11:01,087 --> 01:11:04,408
You're right.
I...I won't lie to you.

636
01:11:07,247 --> 01:11:12,048
My son did bring the problem home for me.

637
01:11:12,448 --> 01:11:14,928
But I took an oath...

638
01:11:15,328 --> 01:11:18,329
to protect the American people

639
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:20,689
from every threat,

640
01:11:20,889 --> 01:11:22,570
both foreign

641
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,891
...and domestic.

642
01:11:38,451 --> 01:11:40,371
- You don't like flying, huh?
- I'm fine.

643
01:11:40,491 --> 01:11:41,651
Just concentrate on
what you're doing.

644
01:11:41,771 --> 01:11:43,411
You sure? You got a bit of sweat on your brow there.

645
01:11:43,491 --> 01:11:46,452
- Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the...
- On the what? Clouds?

646
01:11:46,732 --> 01:11:49,772
We're jumpin' up and down loke a yoyo here.
Where did you get this thing anyway?

647
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,293
Oh, this is my baby, I won her in a game.

648
01:11:52,373 --> 01:11:55,292
- Jacks over fives.
- Great.

649
01:11:56,453 --> 01:11:58,813
Relax. We're almost there.

650
01:12:00,374 --> 01:12:01,853
There it is.

651
01:12:01,973 --> 01:12:03,414
The island.

652
01:12:03,654 --> 01:12:07,014
Three Mile Island.
Hiding in plain sight.

653
01:12:09,935 --> 01:12:12,414
Noone's gonna sneak around
a nuclear reactor.

654
01:12:12,534 --> 01:12:14,855
They think it's gonna turn them into freaks.

655
01:12:14,935 --> 01:12:16,055
Like you?

656
01:12:16,175 --> 01:12:17,736
Right.

657
01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:20,816
All right, you ready?

658
01:12:20,896 --> 01:12:22,376
Cause it's now or never.
Let's go.

659
01:12:22,457 --> 01:12:23,697
About time.

660
01:12:32,537 --> 01:12:35,497
Hey, if it's make you feel any better,
this is really gonna hurt.

661
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:39,018
Oh yeah. It kind of does actually.

662
01:12:39,618 --> 01:12:40,939
Good luck.

663
01:12:41,418 --> 01:12:42,979
Likewise.

664
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:46,139
Oh shit.

665
01:12:52,779 --> 01:12:53,899
How are you doing?

666
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,820
Is everything alright?

667
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:59,140
- Is he ready yet?
- A few hours.

668
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,460
Will he respond to my commands?

669
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,381
Yes, Colonel.

670
01:14:03,347 --> 01:14:04,467
Logan.

671
01:14:05,747 --> 01:14:07,468
Welcome back to the war.

672
01:14:08,787 --> 01:14:11,988
Before you gut you,
I wanna know why.

673
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:15,389
I needed your powers
for the pool.

674
01:14:15,469 --> 01:14:17,069
For the what?

675
01:14:17,149 --> 01:14:20,228
A mutant killer.
The dead pool.

676
01:14:21,029 --> 01:14:24,630
Years of searching him, to find him,
finding the right powers

677
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:29,230
that can coexist in one body
without ripping it apart.

678
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:33,991
My son was the first piece of the puzzle.

679
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:36,671
Logan, you are the last.

680
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:38,751
You made Weapon XI possible.

681
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:40,991
I...

682
01:14:41,472 --> 01:14:46,993
I asked you to help but...
you said you wanted the quiet life.

683
01:14:47,273 --> 01:14:48,033
Well...

684
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:54,952
I've learned that nothing motivates
the men in your family like revenge.

685
01:15:10,555 --> 01:15:12,234
Who are you?

686
01:15:12,955 --> 01:15:15,435
Oh she's a real old friend.

687
01:15:26,556 --> 01:15:28,557
Do you really think we'd
just let you walk away?

688
01:15:29,716 --> 01:15:32,117
You are a dangerous man.

689
01:15:32,317 --> 01:15:34,877
I like to keep an eye on dangerous men.

690
01:15:35,117 --> 01:15:37,198
Tell him about the
day you died.

691
01:15:42,998 --> 01:15:46,118
They gave me a shot of
hydrochloride thiazide.

692
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:51,800
It reduces the heart rate so low,
it appears you flatline.

693
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:05,481
Don't be angry with her.

694
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:09,202
Real credit to your species.

695
01:16:11,762 --> 01:16:15,681
Did you know that her sister
has diamond-hard skin?

696
01:16:15,801 --> 01:16:19,122
Kayla's mutation
is tacto-hypnosis.

697
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:22,042
She can influence people as
long as she touches them.

698
01:16:22,162 --> 01:16:24,723
Quite a useful tool in the seduction.

699
01:16:24,923 --> 01:16:27,443
It was never real, my friend.

700
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,124
It was real for me.

701
01:16:35,844 --> 01:16:39,004
I told you if you came down this road,
you wouldn't like what you'd find.

702
01:16:46,125 --> 01:16:48,125
That story you told me...

703
01:16:48,246 --> 01:16:51,486
about man who gets flowers for the moon...

704
01:16:52,606 --> 01:16:55,407
I had it backwards.

705
01:16:57,367 --> 01:17:00,768
I thought you were the moon
and I was your Wolverine.

706
01:17:02,927 --> 01:17:05,968
But you were the Trickster, aren't you?

707
01:17:06,168 --> 01:17:08,608
I am just the fool that got played.

708
01:17:10,488 --> 01:17:13,888
The worst part of this is
I should have known.

709
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:18,848
But I ignored my instincts.

710
01:17:21,649 --> 01:17:24,529
I ignored what I really am.

711
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:31,410
Well, that will never happen again.

712
01:18:01,134 --> 01:18:03,174
- Colonel.
- Not now, Kayla.

713
01:18:03,254 --> 01:18:05,893
I have done everything you've asked.

714
01:18:07,014 --> 01:18:08,934
My sister...

715
01:18:09,455 --> 01:18:11,694
You said that if I help you,
you'd let her go.

716
01:18:12,295 --> 01:18:14,135
Kayla, it's not as simple as that.

717
01:18:14,215 --> 01:18:16,975
Her mutation is unique.
Quite beautiful.

718
01:18:17,095 --> 01:18:19,136
We just need a little more time
to analyze it, that's all.

719
01:18:19,216 --> 01:18:20,176
You let him go?

720
01:18:23,856 --> 01:18:26,176
- Victor, please.
- You can't let him go.

721
01:18:26,256 --> 01:18:28,536
- You can't beat him, Victor.
- Give me the Adamantium.

722
01:18:28,656 --> 01:18:29,737
- Tests came out...
- We had a deal!

723
01:18:29,817 --> 01:18:31,937
You would never survive the operation.

724
01:18:34,297 --> 01:18:37,258
- I can take anything he can.
- No, you can't.

725
01:18:38,378 --> 01:18:39,497
You are my favorite soldier, Victor.

726
01:18:40,217 --> 01:18:41,778
Be patient, time will come.

727
01:18:42,098 --> 01:18:43,098
He's using us!

728
01:18:51,819 --> 01:18:55,980
How about this time, you die for real?

729
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:57,859
Let me go.

730
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:02,940
Your mindgame don't work on me.

731
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:04,501
Victor!

732
01:19:37,344 --> 01:19:39,265
Feels good, doesn't it?

733
01:19:40,425 --> 01:19:42,505
All that rage...

734
01:19:43,664 --> 01:19:45,185
Do it.

735
01:19:45,265 --> 01:19:46,745
Logan!

736
01:19:47,786 --> 01:19:48,865
You're not an animal.

737
01:19:49,865 --> 01:19:51,746
Oh yes, you are.

738
01:19:55,106 --> 01:19:56,267
Do it.

739
01:20:00,107 --> 01:20:02,187
Finish it.

740
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:26,030
Logan?

741
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:31,310
My sister.

742
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:32,870
They have my sister.

743
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:36,471
Please, I didn't trick you deliberately.

744
01:20:37,231 --> 01:20:38,671
It was real for me too.

745
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:43,792
Please, I'm so sorry.

746
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,273
They have my sister.

747
01:20:46,711 --> 01:20:48,232
Where is she?

748
01:20:53,232 --> 01:20:56,153
- Activate Weapon XI.
- The binding process is incomplete.

749
01:20:56,233 --> 01:20:57,114
Just do it!

750
01:20:57,194 --> 01:20:58,074
Now!

751
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:58,880
You are okay? Come on.

752
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:49,866
Ok...

753
01:22:50,586 --> 01:22:51,826
Perfect.

754
01:22:52,106 --> 01:22:53,946
- Kayla, get these kids out of here.
- Logan...

755
01:22:54,026 --> 01:22:55,866
Find another way out.

756
01:22:55,946 --> 01:22:57,786
Come on, let's go!

757
01:22:58,747 --> 01:23:00,666
Wade, is that you?

758
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:07,268
I guess Stryker finally figured
out how to shut you up.

759
01:23:17,588 --> 01:23:18,349
Wade...

760
01:23:19,789 --> 01:23:21,270
You don't have to do this.

761
01:23:22,629 --> 01:23:23,829
Or maybe you do.

762
01:23:38,271 --> 01:23:39,112
Shoot on sight!

763
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:48,792
I can help! Point me at 'em!

764
01:23:49,112 --> 01:23:49,992
Go!

765
01:23:58,193 --> 01:23:59,274
Go! Now!

766
01:24:05,794 --> 01:24:07,274
D'you think I got them?

767
01:24:07,355 --> 01:24:08,435
Yeah.

768
01:24:17,915 --> 01:24:19,396
- Let's go.
- I can't go.

769
01:24:19,476 --> 01:24:20,595
Kayla, come on!

770
01:24:20,675 --> 01:24:21,515
I have to stay here.

771
01:24:22,236 --> 01:24:24,076
You take them.

772
01:24:24,957 --> 01:24:25,717
Go!

773
01:24:26,396 --> 01:24:27,156
Go!

774
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:55,879
Left.

775
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,840
- What?
- We go left.

776
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,920
- You can't see.
- Trust me.

777
01:25:14,282 --> 01:25:16,362
C'mon Bob! Let's see
your dance up here.

778
01:25:40,045 --> 01:25:40,165
de

779
01:25:40,285 --> 01:25:40,445
decapi

780
01:25:40,525 --> 01:25:40,565
decapita

781
01:25:40,685 --> 01:25:41,444
decapitate

782
01:25:52,646 --> 01:25:54,246
Nobody kills you but me.

783
01:26:03,088 --> 01:26:04,048
Back-to-back!

784
01:26:06,748 --> 01:26:08,188
- I got him!
- Oh no, you don't.

785
01:27:39,978 --> 01:27:40,738
Stop!

786
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:42,738
- This can't be the way.
- This is the way!

787
01:27:42,858 --> 01:27:44,419
- How do you know?
- I just know.

788
01:27:44,819 --> 01:27:45,578
Come on.

789
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:57,500
Adamantium bullets.

790
01:27:58,781 --> 01:28:01,980
Let's see him heal with a few
of these through his thick skull.

791
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:04,461
You can't stop him.
Even with that.

792
01:28:04,581 --> 01:28:05,740
He'll heal.

793
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,901
His brain may heal.

794
01:28:09,181 --> 01:28:11,821
But his memories won't grow back.

795
01:28:27,424 --> 01:28:30,344
That doesn't change anything
between us, Victor.

796
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,064
We're done.

797
01:28:33,184 --> 01:28:35,543
We can never be done, Jimmy.

798
01:28:35,663 --> 01:28:37,464
We're brothers.

799
01:28:37,544 --> 01:28:39,985
Brothers look out for each other.

800
01:29:11,988 --> 01:29:13,749
- You miss me?
- Jesus...

801
01:29:15,788 --> 01:29:19,950
When you said you'd gonna kill everyone,
I thought you may just've been exaggerating.

802
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:21,189
Yeah...

803
01:29:22,509 --> 01:29:24,229
Do I look like a man who exaggerates?

804
01:29:24,749 --> 01:29:25,670
You're welcome.

805
01:29:34,071 --> 01:29:35,391
These kids trying
to get off the island.

806
01:29:35,511 --> 01:29:36,872
- Split up. Go!
- I'm on it.

807
01:29:57,393 --> 01:29:59,353
I love you.

808
01:30:06,595 --> 01:30:07,474
No...

809
01:30:10,914 --> 01:30:12,355
I'm so cold.

810
01:30:12,435 --> 01:30:15,235
Listen to me, I'm gonna
get you outta here.

811
01:30:15,315 --> 01:30:16,155
You understand?

812
01:30:17,075 --> 01:30:18,156
Let's go easy, nice and easy.

813
01:30:18,516 --> 01:30:19,275
That's it.

814
01:30:19,435 --> 01:30:20,196
that's it.

815
01:30:23,437 --> 01:30:25,156
I'm gonna get you out.

816
01:31:42,125 --> 01:31:43,765
I should make you
pull the trigger.

817
01:31:45,365 --> 01:31:47,485
But that would make us
not better than you.

818
01:31:49,205 --> 01:31:50,926
Throw the gun away.

819
01:31:56,007 --> 01:31:57,446
Walk until your feet bleed.

820
01:31:59,087 --> 01:32:00,607
And then keep walking.

821
01:32:37,011 --> 01:32:39,211
<i>It'll be all right, Scott.</i>

822
01:32:39,291 --> 01:32:41,451
<i>My name is Charles Xavier.</i>

823
01:32:41,571 --> 01:32:43,651
<i>I'm a mutant, like you.</i>

824
01:32:43,771 --> 01:32:48,053
<i>- I can hear your thoughts.
- Yes. And I can hear yours.</i>

825
01:32:48,253 --> 01:32:50,373
You're safe now.

826
01:32:50,493 --> 01:32:52,572
<i>Come. We have to go.</i>

827
01:33:39,337 --> 01:33:40,178
The kids are safe.

828
01:33:45,819 --> 01:33:46,978
What the hell happened?

829
01:33:50,419 --> 01:33:53,259
- Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am I?

830
01:33:53,619 --> 01:33:55,819
I'm the guy who brought you here.
Now we gotta go.

831
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:59,099
Where the hell am I?

832
01:33:59,299 --> 01:34:01,580
Listen to me, I am a friend.

833
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:02,941
A friend.

834
01:34:03,021 --> 01:34:04,460
What's my name?

835
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:05,941
What's my name?

836
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:08,261
Your name is Logan.

837
01:34:11,381 --> 01:34:13,981
You need to trust me.
We have to go.

838
01:34:19,302 --> 01:34:20,863
Follow me.

839
01:34:26,024 --> 01:34:26,784
Now!

840
01:34:59,347 --> 01:35:00,987
Do you know her?

841
01:35:04,627 --> 01:35:05,587
No.

842
01:35:10,508 --> 01:35:13,588
These guys are not gonna like
what you've done in this place.

843
01:35:13,668 --> 01:35:14,708
We really need to go.

844
01:35:14,789 --> 01:35:16,788
I'll find my own way.

845
01:35:21,349 --> 01:35:22,589
Good luck.

846
01:36:49,899 --> 01:36:51,819
Colonel Stryker?

847
01:36:55,499 --> 01:36:58,860
- Colonel William Stryker?
- Yes.

848
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:06,181
You're wanted for questioning in
connection of the death of General Munson.Sir!
