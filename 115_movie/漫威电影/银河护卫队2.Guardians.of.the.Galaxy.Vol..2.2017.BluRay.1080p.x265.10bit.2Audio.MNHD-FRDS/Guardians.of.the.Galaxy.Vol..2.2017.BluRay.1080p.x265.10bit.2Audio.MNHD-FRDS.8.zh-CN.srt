- Come on!
- Slow down!

9
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,242
This way, my river lily! Come on!

10
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,358
Where are you taking me?

11
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,878
Come on, come on.

12
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,918
Look. Look!

13
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,038
Oh, it's beautiful!

14
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,238
I was afraid it wouldn't
take to the soil...

15
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,718
but it rooted quickly.

16
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,322
And soon, it'll be everywhere.

17
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:04,376
All across the universe.

18
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,038
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...

19
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,078
but I like the way you say it.

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,491
My heart is yours...

21
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,204
Meredith Quill.

22
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,798
I can't believe I fell
in love with a spaceman.

23
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,038
Showtime, a-holes!

24
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,036
It will be here any minute.

25
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,558
Which will be its loss.

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,198
I thought your thing was a sword?

27
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,283
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...

28
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,010
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

29
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,398
It's just, swords were your
thing and guns were mine.

30
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,358
But I guess we're both doing
guns now. I just didn't know that.

31
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,878
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

32
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,278
It hurts.

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,167
It hurts?

34
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,273
I have sensitive nipples.

35
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,478
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"

36
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,238
What about him? What's he doing?

37
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,918
I'm finishing this so we can
listen to tunes while we work.

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,318
How is that a priority?

39
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,838
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.

40
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,598
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,158
That's hardly important right now.

42
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,678
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.

43
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,838
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

44
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,718
No, I understand that. You're
being very serious right now.

45
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,758
I can clearly see you winking.

46
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,838
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

47
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,398
I am Groot.

48
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,920
They were not looking at you funny.

49
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,804
Well, that's intense.

50
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,201
Groot!

51
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,078
Groot, get out of the
way! You're gonna get hurt!

52
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,081
Hi.

53
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,958
No! Spit it out! Spit it out!

54
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,121
Come on!

55
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,531
Disgusting!

56
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,558
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

57
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,518
I must cut through it from the inside.

58
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,598
Huh?

59
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,198
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

60
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,008
Drax!

61
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,358
What is he doing?

62
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,238
He said the skin is too thick to be
pierced from the outside, so he...

63
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,238
- That doesn't make any sense!
- I tried telling him that!

64
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,918
Skin is the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

65
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,678
I realize that.

66
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,369
There is a cut on its neck.

67
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:17,729
Rocket, get it to look up.

68
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,918
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!

69
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,198
Watch it, Quill!

70
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:24,664
Yes! I have single-handedly
vanquished the beast!

71
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,361
What?

72
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,789
What are they called again?

73
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,838
Anulax batteries.

74
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,198
Harbulary batteries.

75
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,678
That's nothing like what I just said.

76
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,518
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...

77
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,678
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.

78
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,911
Careful what you say around these
folks. They're easily offended.

79
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:56,004
The cost of transgression is death.

80
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,638
We thank you, Guardians, for
putting your lives on the line.

81
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,645
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

82
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:10,518
Every citizen is born exactly
as designed by the community.

83
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,838
Impeccable, both
physically and mentally.

84
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,158
We control the DNA of our progeny...

85
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,678
germinating them in birthing pods.

86
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,162
I guess I prefer to make
people the old-fashioned way.

87
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,358
Perhaps someday, you could
give me a history lesson...

88
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,678
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

89
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,958
For academic purposes.

90
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,918
I would be honored, yes.

91
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,078
In the name of research...

92
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,414
I think that could be pretty, uh...

93
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,703
repulsive.

94
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,478
I'm not into that kind of casual...

95
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,678
Oh, please.

96
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,158
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

97
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,114
Bring it...

98
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:49,767
and we shall gladly be on our way.

99
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,758
Family reunion. Yay.

100
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,358
I understand she is your sister.

101
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,038
She's worth no more to me than
the bounty due for her on Xandar.

102
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,204
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

103
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,478
Do with her as you please.

104
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,838
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

105
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,411
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

106
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,438
My mother is from Earth.

107
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,169
And your father?

108
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,958
He ain't from Missouri.
That's all I know.

109
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,291
I see it within you.

110
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,278
An unorthodox genealogy.

111
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,410
A hybrid that seems particularly...

112
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,970
reckless.

113
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,463
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...

114
00:11:57,977 --> 00:12:00,588
but that isn't true at all.

115
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,918
Oh, shit.

116
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,862
I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?

117
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:10,979
I'm sorry. That was meant
to be behind your back.

118
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:14,318
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

119
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,706
You're telling me.

120
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:18,447
You wanna buy some batteries?

121
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,678
All right, let's get baldy to Xandar

122
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,125
and collect that bounty.

123
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,678
That stuff about my father...

124
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,838
Who does she think she is?

125
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,318
I know you're sensitive about that.

126
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,520
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

127
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,558
Sorry if it seemed like I was
flirting with the High Priestess.

128
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,837
I wasn't.

129
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,078
I don't care if you were.

130
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:46,039
Well, I feel like you do care.

131
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:48,878
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

132
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,962
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

133
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,960
Damn shadow.

134
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:55,278
There are two types of
beings in the universe...

135
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,438
those who dance, and those who do not.

136
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,438
Mmm-hmm.

137
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,598
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

138
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,678
Oh, God.

139
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,678
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.

140
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,598
Except one woman.

141
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,045
My Ovette.

142
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,198
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

143
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,646
The most melodic song in
the world could be playing.

144
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,567
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

145
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,678
Wouldn't move a muscle.

146
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,558
One might assume she was dead.

147
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,558
That does sound pretty hot.

148
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,358
It would make my nether regions engorge.

149
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,398
Okay. I get it, yes.

150
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,478
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

151
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,205
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.

152
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,241
Mmm.

153
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,358
I'm hungry. Hand me
some of that yaro root.

154
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,958
No. It's not ripe yet...

155
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,238
and I hate you.

156
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,638
You hate me?

157
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,518
You left me there while you
stole that stone for yourself.

158
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,798
And yet here you stand, a hero.

159
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,118
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.

160
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,478
I swear.

161
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,758
No.

162
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,638
You're gonna live out
the rest of your days

163
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,318
in a prison on Xandar...

164
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,238
wishing you could.

165
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,416
This is weird.

166
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:14,717
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.

167
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,612
Why would they do that?

168
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,518
Probably because Rocket
stole some of their batteries.

169
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,787
Dude!

170
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,868
Right.

171
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:21,358
He didn't steal some of those.

172
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,318
I don't know why they're after
us. What a mystery this is.

173
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,028
What were you thinking?

174
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:37,757
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

175
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,358
- That's your defense?
- Come on!

176
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,798
You saw how that High
Priestess talked down to us.

177
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,529
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

178
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,078
Oh, I didn't realize your
motivation was altruism.

179
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,598
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...

180
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,358
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!

181
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,278
I was being sarcastic!

182
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,050
Oh, no!

183
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,097
You're supposed to
use a sarcastic voice!

184
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,578
Now I look foolish!

185
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,878
Can we put the bickering on hold until
after we survive this massive space battle?

186
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,678
- More incoming!
- Good!

187
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,638
I wanna kill some guys!

188
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,558
You're not killing anyone.

189
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,085
All those ships are remotely piloted.

190
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,718
Damn it!

191
00:16:29,812 --> 00:16:32,318
What is the delay, Admiral?

192
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,086
High Priestess, the batteries, they
are exceptionally combustible...

193
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:37,708
and could destroy the entire fleet.

194
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:40,611
Our concern is their
slight against our people.

195
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,449
We hired them and they steal from us.

196
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,925
It is heresy of the highest order.

197
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,078
All command modules...

198
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,686
fire with the intent to kill.

199
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,809
What's the nearest habitable planet?

200
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,398
It's called Berhert.

201
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,198
- How many jumps?
- Only one.

202
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,358
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

203
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,204
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

204
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:25,821
Quill, to make it through that...

205
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:27,948
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.

206
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:29,118
Lucky for us, I...

207
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,485
I am.

208
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:44,277
What are you doing?

209
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,478
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

210
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,558
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

211
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,345
You were cybernetically
engineered to be a douchebag!

212
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:53,345
Stop it.

213
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:55,838
Later on tonight, you're gonna
be laying down in your bed...

214
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,998
and there's gonna be something
squishy in your pillow case.

215
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,438
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"

216
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,881
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!

217
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:05,318
You put your turd in
my bed, I shave you.

218
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,958
Oh, it won't be my turd.

219
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,438
It will be Drax's.

220
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,918
I have famously huge turds.

221
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,526
We're about to die, and this
is what we're discussing?

222
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,198
Son of a...

223
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,198
Dude! Seriously!

224
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,358
Hey! Let me...

225
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,158
Idiots!

226
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,198
Well, that's what you get

227
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,758
when Quill flies.

228
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,518
Ow!

229
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,727
We still have a
Sovereign craft behind us.

230
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,638
Our weapons are down.

231
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,722
20 clicks to the jump!

232
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,809
Hold on.

233
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,128
It's not ripe.

234
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,202
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

235
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,404
Yes!

236
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,077
15 clicks to the jump!

237
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,206
Come on!

238
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,490
Keep going!

239
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,926
10 clicks!

240
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,329
Die, spaceship!

241
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,558
You suck, Zylak.

242
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,607
Typical.

243
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,247
Five clicks!

244
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,078
Son of a...

245
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,923
They went around the field!

246
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:28,638
Someone destroyed all our ships!

247
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,880
What?

248
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,569
Who?

249
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,045
One click!

250
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:39,946
- What is that?
- Who cares?

251
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:42,118
That's the jump point! Go! Go!

252
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,929
It's a guy.

253
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,038
Oh, my God.

254
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,485
He's still out there?

255
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,801
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

256
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,041
Prepare for a really bad landing!

257
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,528
That was awesome!

258
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,921
Yes!

259
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,366
Look at this!

260
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,878
Where is the other half of our ship?

261
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,038
My ship.

262
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,870
Either one of you could have
gotten us through that field...

263
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:28,318
had you flown with what's between your
ears instead of what's between your legs!

264
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,318
If what's between my
legs had a hand on it...

265
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,413
I guarantee I could have
landed this ship with it.

266
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:36,918
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.

267
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,238
More like because he stole...

268
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,478
the Anulax batteries!

269
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,958
They're called Harbulary batteries.

270
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,499
No, they're not!

271
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:46,197
Do you know why I did
it, Star-Munch? Hmm?

272
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,798
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

273
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,878
I did it because I wanted to!

274
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,718
Dick.

275
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,758
What are we even talking about this for?

276
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,398
We just had a little man save
us by blowing up 50 ships!

277
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,438
How little?

278
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,838
Well, I don't know, like this?

279
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,638
A little one-inch man saved us?

280
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,958
Well, if he got closer, I'm
sure he would be much larger.

281
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,478
That's how eyesight
works, you stupid raccoon.

282
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,198
Don't call me a raccoon!

283
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,646
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

284
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,883
I meant trash panda.

285
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,798
Is that better?

286
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,718
I don't know.

287
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,118
It's worse. It's so much worse.

288
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,518
You son of a...

289
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,398
Hey!

290
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,043
- I've had it with you!
- No! Back up!

291
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:26,085
Someone followed you
through the jump point.

292
00:23:27,175 --> 00:23:30,038
Set me free, you'll need my help.

293
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,318
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

294
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,358
You are a fool if you deprive
yourself a hand in combat.

295
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,718
You'll attack me the
moment I let you go.

296
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,878
No, I won't.

297
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,318
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.

298
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,288
I bet it's the one-inch man.

299
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,886
After all these years, I've found you.

300
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,370
And who the hell are you?

301
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,483
I figured my rugged good
looks would make that obvious.

302
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,882
My name is Ego...

303
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,868
and I'm your dad, Peter.

304
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,658
You know what they say...

305
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:50,730
"You're out of luck
until you've gone duck."

306
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,931
Yondu!

307
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,608
Come on down!

308
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,558
After going around years in circles...

309
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,638
with this woman I end up marrying.

310
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,438
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

311
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,038
but you're losing your mind!"

312
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,158
Then again, she's always been that way.

313
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,118
I could never trust her. You know?

314
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,121
Stakar.

315
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,089
It's been some time.

316
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,205
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

317
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,398
- Sir!
- Stakar!

318
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,998
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

319
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,118
You lost the business of
99 of them by serving one.

320
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,809
Please, sir. Please!

321
00:26:15,812 --> 00:26:17,080
Get away from me.

322
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,518
You can go to hell then!

323
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,038
I don't give a damn
what you think of me!

324
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,662
So what are you following us for?

325
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:31,417
Because you're gonna
listen to what I gotta say!

326
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:33,037
I don't gotta listen to nothing!

327
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,518
You betrayed the code!

328
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,518
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

329
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,518
I told you before! I didn't
know what was going on!

330
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,238
You didn't know because you didn't
want to know because it made you rich.

331
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,478
I demand a seat at the table!

332
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,718
I wear these flames, same as you.

333
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,386
You may dress like us...

334
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:51,638
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

335
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,678
And the Colors of Ogord...

336
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,002
will never flash over your grave.

337
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,691
If you think...

338
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,043
I take pleasure in exiling you...

339
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,410
you're wrong.

340
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,570
You broke all our hearts.

341
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,561
Ah, pathetic.

342
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,838
First, Quill betrays us...

343
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,128
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

344
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:38,033
We followed him because
he was the one...

345
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:41,238
who wasn't afraid to do
what needed to be done.

346
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,078
Seems he's goin' soft.

347
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,117
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?

348
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,078
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

349
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,678
You best be very careful what
you say about our captain.

350
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,250
Who the hell is that?

351
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,964
Yondu Udonta...

352
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,358
I have a proposition for you.

353
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:42,829
I hired Yondu to pick you up...

354
00:28:42,832 --> 00:28:44,838
when your mother passed away.

355
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,838
But instead of returning you...

356
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,798
Yondu kept you.

357
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,406
I have no clue as to why.

358
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,158
Well, I'll tell you why.

359
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,318
Because I was a skinny little kid who
could squeeze into places adults couldn't.

360
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,998
It made it easier for thievin'.

361
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,717
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.

362
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,558
I thought Yondu was your father.

363
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,798
What? We've been together
this whole time...

364
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,758
and you thought Yondu was
my actual blood relative?

365
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,158
You look exactly alike.

366
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,810
One's blue!

367
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,238
No, he's not my father!

368
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,417
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...

369
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,838
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...

370
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,998
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.

371
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,518
- Eat you?
- Yeah.

372
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,678
Oh, that son of a bitch.

373
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,045
How'd you locate us now?

374
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,038
Well, even where I reside, out
past the edge of what's known...

375
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,598
we've heard tell about the
man they call Star-Lord.

376
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,573
What say we head out there right now?

377
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:39,800
Your associates are welcome. Even
that triangle-faced monkey there.

378
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,438
I promise you...

379
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,363
it's unlike any other
place you've ever seen.

380
00:29:44,926 --> 00:29:46,564
And there...

381
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:50,526
I can explain your
very special heritage.

382
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,838
Finally get to be...

383
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,571
the father I've always wanted to be.

384
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,998
Excuse me.

385
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,411
I've gotta take a whiz.

386
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,289
I'm not buying it.

387
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,204
Let's go take a walk.

388
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,410
I am Mantis.

389
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,878
What are you doing?

390
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,245
Smiling.

391
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,871
I hear it is the thing to
do to make people like you.

392
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,527
Not if you do it like that.

393
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,358
Oh...

394
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,158
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

395
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,802
I do not understand the
intricacies of social interaction.

396
00:30:45,915 --> 00:30:49,847
Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.

397
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,727
Yes.

398
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,958
That is called a practical joke!

399
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,198
I liked it very much!

400
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,198
I just made it up!

401
00:31:17,053 --> 00:31:18,557
Give me a break!

402
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,118
After all this time, you're gonna
show up, and all of a sudden...

403
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,998
- you wanna be my dad?
- I hear you.

404
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,762
And by the way, this could be a trap.

405
00:31:24,765 --> 00:31:27,038
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

406
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,798
- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...

407
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,918
But what?

408
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,398
What was that story you told
me about Zardu Hasselfrau?

409
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,598
Who?

410
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,111
He owned a magic boat?

411
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,127
David Hasselhoff?

412
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:38,994
Right.

413
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,558
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

414
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,718
Why did he talk again?

415
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,398
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

416
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,158
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...

417
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,998
and you would tell all
the other children...

418
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,318
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

419
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,998
Shooting Knight Rider or
touring with his band in Germany.

420
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,518
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?

421
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,678
I love that story.

422
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,798
I hate that story.

423
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,325
It's so sad!

424
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,678
As a kid, I used to see all the other
kids off playing catch with their dad.

425
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,365
And I wanted that, more
than anything in the world!

426
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,804
That's my point, Peter.

427
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,484
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

428
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,028
If he ends up being evil...

429
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,410
we will just kill him.

430
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,198
You're leaving me with that fox?

431
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,518
He's not a fox.

432
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,638
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.

433
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,008
- Or if you feel like it.
- Okay.

434
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:45,520
It'll be just a couple of days.

435
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:48,798
We'll be back before Rocket's
finished fixing the ship.

436
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,301
What if the Sovereign come?

437
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,038
There's no way for them to
know we're here. Let's go.

438
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,798
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

439
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,558
God, you're like an old woman.

440
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,244
Because I'm wise?

441
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,039
Why do you have so much luggage?

442
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:06,204
I don't want Groot
playing with my things.

443
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,326
I hope Daddy isn't as big
of a dick as you, orphan boy.

444
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:18,396
What is your goal here? To
get everybody to hate you?

445
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,192
Because it's working.

446
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,360
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

447
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:12,117
Oh...

448
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,918
No one has ever asked
me a personal question.

449
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,771
Your antennae, what are they for?

450
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:18,318
Their purpose?

451
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,318
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

452
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,084
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

453
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:24,638
I say...

454
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,198
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...

455
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,158
your antennae will feel this, and
keep you from being decapitated.

456
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,478
Right. And if it's
anything other than...

457
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,038
you specifically not being
decapitated by a doorway, I win.

458
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,678
They are not for feeling doorways.

459
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,598
I think...

460
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,878
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

461
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,078
What are those?

462
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:49,985
If I touch someone, I
can feel their feelings.

463
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:52,638
- You read minds?
- No.

464
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,998
Telepaths know thoughts.

465
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,526
Empaths feel feelings.

466
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,681
Emotions.

467
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,486
May I?

468
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,045
All right.

469
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,761
You feel love.

470
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,558
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.

471
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,878
No!

472
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,998
Romantic, sexual love.

473
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,518
No, I don't.

474
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,090
- For her!
- No!

475
00:35:28,113 --> 00:35:29,677
That is not...

476
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,196
Okay.

477
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,038
She just told everyone your
deepest, darkest secret!

478
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,518
Dude, I think you're
overreacting a little bit!

479
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,038
You must be so embarrassed!

480
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:47,569
Do me! Do me!

481
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,958
I have never felt such humor!

482
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,402
So unbelievably uncool.

483
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,205
Oh, Quill.

484
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,531
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

485
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,678
I can also alter
emotions to some extent.

486
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,557
Yeah, like what?

487
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,155
If I touch someone who is sad...

488
00:36:24,158 --> 00:36:27,758
I can ease them into
contentment for a short while.

489
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,718
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

490
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,958
But I mostly use it to
help my master sleep.

491
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,230
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

492
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,121
Do one of those on me.

493
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,284
Sleep.

494
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,838
I love this song.

495
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,281
Huh?

496
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,766
There!

497
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,401
Ah...

498
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,008
Ain't so tough now without
all your toys, are you?

499
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,047
Move!

500
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,966
Crap.

501
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,158
Hey there, rat!

502
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,998
How's it going, you blue idiot?

503
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,198
Not so bad.

504
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,758
We got ourselves a pretty
good little gig here.

505
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,758
This golden gal with quite
a high opinion of herself...

506
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,838
has offered us a large sum to deliver
you and your pals over to her...

507
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,878
because she wants

508
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,598
to kill y'all.

509
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,998
Your friend...

510
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,838
There's too many of them.

511
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,238
He needs my help. If
you care about him...

512
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,438
you need to get me out of these bonds.

513
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,518
They are going to kill him!

514
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,798
I tell you, it was
pretty easy to find you.

515
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,958
I put a tracer on
your ship back there...

516
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,798
during the war over Xandar.

517
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,358
Give me your word you
won't hurt Groot...

518
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,249
and I'll tell you
where the batteries are.

519
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,958
Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.

520
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,358
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

521
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,257
Otherwise, you'd what?

522
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,598
We'll take them batteries.

523
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,198
They're worth what? A quarter
mill on the open market?

524
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,718
That Priestess offered us a million.

525
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,598
A quarter is only one third of that!

526
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,878
A quarter ain't a third.

527
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,838
A quarter is 25.

528
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,998
No.

529
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,438
We can't even buy a pair
of boots with 25 units.

530
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,638
Enough!

531
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,878
The point is, we ain't stupid enough to
help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

532
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,360
The whole dang Nova
Corps would be on us.

533
00:41:24,363 --> 00:41:26,441
That ain't right!

534
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:30,437
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.

535
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,918
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

536
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,958
you protect him like none of
the rest of us much matter!

537
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,118
Yeah!

538
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,798
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

539
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,918
Take it easy, Kraglin.

540
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,598
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

541
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,548
Suppose it's time for
a change in leadership.

542
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,158
Put your damn guns down!

543
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,598
Whoa! Whoa!

544
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,238
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

545
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,118
Or even a violent one where
I'm standing over there.

546
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,764
Well, hello, boys.

547
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,010
It's not ripe.

548
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,358
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

549
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,918
Wow. You have your own planet?

550
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,918
Come on. No larger
than your Earth's Moon.

551
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,598
Humility.

552
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,358
I like it.

553
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,727
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

554
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,958
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.

555
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,769
What are you exactly?

556
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,163
I'm what's called a
Celestial, sweetheart.

557
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,006
A Celestial, like a god?

558
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,878
Mmm, small "g," son.

559
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,798
At least on the days I'm
feeling humble as Drax.

560
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,041
Whoa!

561
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,638
I don't know where I came from exactly.

562
00:44:51,641 --> 00:44:54,237
First thing I remember is flickering...

563
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,306
adrift in the cosmos utterly...

564
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,526
and entirely alone.

565
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,758
Over millions of years...

566
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,638
I learned to control
the molecules around me.

567
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,723
I grew smarter and stronger.

568
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:14,877
And I continued building from there...

569
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,158
layer by layer...

570
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,918
the very planet you walk on now.

571
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,798
Whoa.

572
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,961
But I wanted more.

573
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,318
I desired...

574
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,481
meaning.

575
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,798
"There must be some life
out there in the universe...

576
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,758
"besides just me," I thought.

577
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,118
And so, I set myself
the task of finding it.

578
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,718
I created...

579
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,518
what I imagined biological
life to be like...

580
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,286
down to the most minute detail.

581
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,918
Did you make a penis?

582
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,278
Dude!

583
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,678
What is wrong with you?

584
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,838
If he is a planet, how could
he make a baby with your mother?

585
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,477
He would smush her!

586
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,287
I don't need to hear how my parents...

587
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,521
Why?

588
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,958
My father would tell the story

589
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,038
of impregnating my mother
every winter solstice.

590
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,638
That's disgusting.

591
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,085
It was beautiful.

592
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,970
You Earthers have hang-ups.

593
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,718
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

594
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,518
Ha! Thank you!

595
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,878
It's not half bad.

596
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,518
- Oh.
- Ugh.

597
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,198
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...

598
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,438
and all the accompanying junk.

599
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,238
I wanted to experience what
it truly meant to be human...

600
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,244
as I set out amongst the stars...

601
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,278
until I found...

602
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,964
what I sought.

603
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,721
Life.

604
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,761
I was not alone in
the universe after all.

605
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,403
When did you meet my mother?

606
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,244
Not long after.

607
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,688
It was with Meredith that
I first experienced love.

608
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,763
I called her my river lily.

609
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,526
And from that love, Peter...

610
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,366
you.

611
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,167
I have searched for you for so long.

612
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,598
And when I heard of a man from Earth...

613
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,366
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

614
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:54,542
I knew you must be the
son of the woman I loved.

615
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,081
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

616
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,049
This is mutiny!

617
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,158
This is mutiny! This is mutiny!

618
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,198
You're scum!

619
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,038
Oh!

620
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,798
Captain!

621
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,558
Help me! Please!

622
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,085
Captain!

623
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,638
You're the one what killed those men...

624
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,449
by leading them down the wrong path.

625
00:49:30,094 --> 00:49:32,158
Because you're weak.

626
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,965
And stupid!

627
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:40,510
It's time for the Ravagers...

628
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:44,199
to rise once again to
glory with a new captain...

629
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,638
Taserface!

630
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,958
I'm sorry. Your name is...

631
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,078
It's Taserface?

632
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,397
That's right.

633
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,087
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

634
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,718
It's metaphorical!

635
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,562
Yeah!

636
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:12,162
For what?

637
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,358
For it is a name what strikes fear...

638
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,278
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

639
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,040
Okay.

640
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,078
Okay...

641
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,758
whatever you say.

642
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,238
You shut up.

643
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,758
You're next.

644
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,798
Udonta, I have waited
a long time to do...

645
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,920
What?

646
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,238
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

647
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,438
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...

648
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,598
looking in the mirror and then in
all seriousness saying to yourself...

649
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,238
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?

650
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,784
"Taserface!"

651
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:55,092
That's how I hear you in my head!

652
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,438
What was your second choice?

653
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,283
Scrotum Hat?

654
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,211
New plan. We're killing you first.

655
00:51:05,214 --> 00:51:09,838
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...

656
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,998
as a moronic shitbag who
thinks Taserface is a cool name.

657
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,844
That's enough killing for today.

658
00:51:20,613 --> 00:51:22,263
She's the daughter of Thanos.

659
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,342
I thought you were the
biggest sadist in the galaxy.

660
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:30,038
That was when Daddy was paying my bills.

661
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,259
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

662
00:51:33,262 --> 00:51:36,684
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

663
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,998
I assure you...

664
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,998
I am not as easy a mark as an
old man without his magic stick...

665
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,843
or a talking woodland beast.

666
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,083
I want 10% of the take...

667
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,529
and a couple more things.

668
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,158
We got a whole box of hands...

669
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,158
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.

670
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,518
You think them Kree is
gonna execute the captain?

671
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,918
The Kree consider themselves
merciful. It will be painless.

672
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,558
Well, here it is. It's
the best ship we got.

673
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,358
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

674
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,838
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

675
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,968
What are you gonna do with your share?

676
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,278
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me

677
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,089
battle one another in training.

678
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,358
Every time my sister prevailed...

679
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,838
my father would replace a
piece of me with machinery...

680
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,525
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

681
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,598
But she won...

682
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,447
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

683
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,558
So after I murder my sister...

684
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,798
I will buy a warship

685
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,958
with every conceivable
instrument of death.

686
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,758
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...

687
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,358
piece by piece...

688
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,918
until he knows some semblance of
the profound and unceasing pain...

689
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,049
I know every single day.

690
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,758
Yeah.

691
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,560
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

692
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,398
Or a nice hat.

693
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,131
Something to make the other
girls go, "Ooh, that's nice!"

694
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,289
Anyways, happy trails.

695
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,527
My mother told everyone my
father was from the stars.

696
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,713
She had brain cancer, so everyone
thought she was delusional.

697
00:53:30,716 --> 00:53:31,914
Peter...

698
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,078
Listen, I'd love to believe
all of this, I really would.

699
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,638
But you left...

700
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,638
the most wonderful woman ever...

701
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,318
to die alone.

702
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,878
I didn't want to leave
your mother, Peter.

703
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,238
If I don't return
regularly to my planet...

704
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,758
and the light within it...

705
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,478
this form will wither and perish.

706
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,638
So why didn't you come
back? Why did you send Yondu?

707
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,998
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

708
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,118
I loved your mother, Peter!

709
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,638
I couldn't stand to
set foot on an Earth...

710
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,638
where she wasn't living! You
can't imagine what that's like!

711
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,198
I know exactly what that feels like!

712
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,964
I had to watch her die!

713
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,638
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

714
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,120
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

715
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,167
But you're not one of them.

716
00:54:21,906 --> 00:54:25,627
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

717
00:54:30,575 --> 00:54:35,877
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

718
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,998
and the light within.

719
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,129
They are a part of you, Peter.

720
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,644
What do you mean?

721
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,363
Give me your hands, son.

722
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,486
Here.

723
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,249
Hold them like that.

724
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,050
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

725
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,398
Take your brain to the
center of this planet.

726
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,358
Yes! Yes!

727
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,238
Whoa!

728
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,758
Yes! It's okay.

729
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,038
Just relax. Concentrate.

730
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,678
You can do it. Bring it back.

731
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,761
Yes!

732
00:55:21,121 --> 00:55:24,558
Yes, now shape it.

733
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,244
Feel that energy.

734
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,401
Yes.

735
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,051
You're home.

736
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,761
Peter...

737
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,170
How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?

738
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,454
Ego found me in my larva state.

739
00:56:21,457 --> 00:56:23,285
Orphaned on my homeworld.

740
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,561
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

741
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,691
So you're a pet?

742
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,291
I suppose.

743
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,318
People usually want cute pets.

744
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,758
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?

745
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,238
I am hideous?

746
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,825
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

747
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,838
But that's a good thing.

748
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,198
Oh?

749
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,958
When you're ugly, and
someone loves you...

750
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,486
you know they love you for who you are.

751
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,207
Beautiful people never
know who to trust.

752
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:00,004
Well, then I'm certainly
grateful to be ugly.

753
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,838
Those pools, they remind me of a time...

754
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,367
when I took my daughter to the
forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

755
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,318
She was like you.

756
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,765
Disgusting?

757
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,001
Innocent.

758
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,495
Drax?

759
00:57:50,596 --> 00:57:52,524
There's something I must tell you.

760
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:02,027
What's going on?

761
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:04,278
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

762
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,078
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

763
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,758
You're not ugly. Drax!

764
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,238
What are you talking about?

765
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,575
Mantis...

766
00:58:12,578 --> 00:58:15,518
can you show us where we'll be staying?

767
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,438
Why are there no other
beings on this planet?

768
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,718
The planet is Ego.

769
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,717
A dog would not invite a
flea to live on his back.

770
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,118
And you're not a flea?

771
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,441
I'm a flea with a purpose.

772
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,650
I help him sleep.

773
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,963
What were you about to say
to Drax before I walked out?

774
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,087
Nothing.

775
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,929
Your quarters are this way.

776
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,002
We deliver you to the
Kree in the morning.

777
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,449
Neither one of you will
last much longer after that.

778
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,168
Okay, Taserface.

779
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,158
Hey, tell the other guys we said...

780
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,571
"Hi," Taserface!

781
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,438
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

782
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,118
No, Gef.

783
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,958
It's too adorable to kill.

784
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,803
Take it to the tailor.

785
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,643
No offense, but your
employees are a bunch of jerks.

786
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,842
I was a Kree battle slave for
20 years when Stakar freed me.

787
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:36,278
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.

788
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,878
He said all I needed to
do was adhere to the code.

789
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,689
But I was young...

790
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,087
and greedy, and stupid.

791
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,318
Like you stealing those batteries.

792
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,845
That was mostly Drax.

793
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,841
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

794
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,121
we weren't so different
from you and your friends.

795
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,003
The only family I ever had.

796
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,124
When I broke the code...

797
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,044
they exiled me.

798
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,998
This is what I deserve.

799
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,878
Slow down, drama queen.

800
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,678
You might deserve this, but I don't.

801
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,444
We gotta get outta here.

802
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,198
Where's Quill?

803
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,770
He went off with his old man.

804
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,358
- Ego?
- Yeah.

805
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,718
It's a day for dumbass names.

806
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,998
You're smiling. And for a
second, I got a warm feeling.

807
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,838
But then it was ruined by
those disgusting-ass teeth.

808
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,291
You like a professional asshole or what?

809
01:00:39,294 --> 01:00:40,558
Pretty much a pro.

810
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,245
Why didn't you deliver Quill
to Ego like you promised?

811
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,958
He was skinny.

812
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,327
Could fit into places we
couldn't. Good for thievin'.

813
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:51,601
Uh-huh.

814
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,249
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

815
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,726
But we're gonna need your little friend.

816
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,247
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

817
01:01:16,112 --> 01:01:18,687
Little fellow's all worked
up! He needs a drink!

818
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,638
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

819
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,118
He's goddang precious!

820
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,558
Psst!

821
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,598
Hey, twig!

822
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,478
Come here.

823
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,720
Come on.

824
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,478
Aw, man...

825
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,925
what did they do to you?

826
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,486
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

827
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,677
There's something I need you
to get, and bring back to me.

828
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,918
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...

829
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,968
the thing I wore on my head.

830
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:18,478
There's a drawer next to the
bunk. It's in that. It's red.

831
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,766
You got it?

832
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,158
That's my underwears.

833
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,398
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't
know what you were talkin' about.

834
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,402
You have to explain it more careful.

835
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,362
It's a prototype fin.

836
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,758
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

837
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,364
You explain it this time.

838
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,051
All right.

839
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,918
That's Vorker's eye.

840
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,078
He takes it out when he sleeps.

841
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,598
Go. Look again.

842
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,358
But leave the eye here.

843
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,638
Why?

844
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,198
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

845
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,718
and he's not gonna know...

846
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,961
where his eye is!

847
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,918
That's a desk.

848
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,605
We told you it was this big.

849
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,918
Tell me you guys have a
refrigerator somewhere...

850
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,798
with a bunch of severed human toes.

851
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,407
Okay. Then let's just
agree to never discuss this.

852
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,518
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

853
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,885
Okay?

854
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,053
What? No!

855
01:04:17,056 --> 01:04:18,718
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

856
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,198
That's not what I said!

857
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,124
I am Groot.

858
01:04:21,127 --> 01:04:22,478
He's relieved you don't want him to.

859
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,118
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.

860
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:24,998
I am Groot.

861
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,318
On anyone, not just himself.

862
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,238
I am Groot.

863
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,842
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...

864
01:04:28,844 --> 01:04:32,251
the next minute it's just because you
realize part of that head is the hat.

865
01:04:32,254 --> 01:04:33,630
That's why you don't like hats?

866
01:04:34,406 --> 01:04:36,693
This is an important
conversation right now?

867
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,066
That ain't it.

868
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,045
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

869
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,923
They killed all my friends.

870
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,486
Get the third quadrant
ready for release.

871
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,566
One more thing.

872
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,361
You got any clones of
Quill's old music on the ship?

873
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,958
Ah.

874
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,318
He's got it!

875
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,998
Yondu's got the fin!

876
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,922
Go!

877
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,790
Down there!

878
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,003
Oh!

879
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,180
You maniac.

880
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,767
The whole ship's gonna blow.

881
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,478
Not the whole ship.

882
01:09:59,076 --> 01:10:00,274
Who is this?

883
01:10:00,277 --> 01:10:05,278
I am sending you the
coordinates for Yondu's ship.

884
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,238
- Release the quadrant!
- Aye, Captain!

885
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,238
I only ask one thing.

886
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,038
That your High Priestess...

887
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,523
tell him the name of the
man what sealed his fate.

888
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,729
Taserface!

889
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,478
Where to, Captain?

890
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,481
Ego.

891
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,167
No, boy!

892
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:59,758
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

893
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,878
I know that.

894
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,247
We are about to do 700!

895
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,248
So I guess this could
all be mine someday.

896
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,126
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

897
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,089
What are you doing, Peter?

898
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,918
Dance with me.

899
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,558
I'm not going to dance with you.

900
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,838
This is Sam Cooke...

901
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,003
one of the greatest
Earth singers of all time.

902
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,162
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

903
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,998
If you ever tell anyone about this...

904
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,411
I will kill you.

905
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:24,051
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

906
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,091
What unspoken thing?

907
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,398
This...

908
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,358
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

909
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,118
a guy and a girl on a TV
show who dig each other...

910
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,558
but never say it because if they do,

911
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,798
the ratings would go down...

912
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,038
sort of thing.

913
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,485
There's no unspoken thing.

914
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,518
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,

915
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,878
then it would be spoken...

916
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,798
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...

917
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,078
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.

918
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,003
No, that's not what I...

919
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:01,558
What we should be discussing right
now is something about this place.

920
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,798
It doesn't feel right.

921
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,118
What are you talking about?

922
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,558
You're the one who
wanted me to come here!

923
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,958
That girl Mantis...

924
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,478
she's afraid of something.

925
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,758
Why are you trying to
take this away from me?

926
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,038
I'm not trying...

927
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,158
He's my father. He's blood.

928
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,958
You have blood on Earth and you
never wanted to return there.

929
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,726
Again, you made me come here!

930
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,318
And Earth is the place where
my mother died in front of me.

931
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,198
No, it's because that place
is real, and this is a fantasy.

932
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,038
This is real! I'm only
half human, remember?

933
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,400
That's the half I'm worried about.

934
01:13:29,403 --> 01:13:31,552
Oh, I get it. You're jealous...

935
01:13:31,555 --> 01:13:34,357
because I'm part-god, and you
like when I'm the weak one.

936
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,038
You were insufferable to begin with.

937
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,358
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

938
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,133
I'm gonna go outside, and I'm
gonna try and get a signal.

939
01:13:40,135 --> 01:13:42,998
You know what? This is
not Cheers after all!

940
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,998
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...

941
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,798
to open themselves
up to new possibility,

942
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,638
and the other person is a jerk....

943
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,518
who doesn't trust anybody!

944
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,438
It's a show that doesn't exist.

945
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,358
That's why it would get zero ratings!

946
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,678
I don't know what Cheers is!

947
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,650
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

948
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,530
I thought you already had.

949
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,280
Damn it.

950
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,441
Psychopath!

951
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,564
Are you kidding me?

952
01:17:47,406 --> 01:17:48,597
I win.

953
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,958
I win. I bested you in combat.

954
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,038
No. I saved your life.

955
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,038
Well, you were stupid
enough to let me live.

956
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,078
You let me live!

957
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,118
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!

958
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,918
I'm not the one that just flew across
the universe just because I wanted to win.

959
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,638
Do not tell me what I want.

960
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,238
I don't need to tell you what you want!

961
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,398
It's obvious!

962
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,370
You were the one who wanted to
win. And I just wanted a sister!

963
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,765
You were all I had.

964
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,805
But you were the one who needed to win.

965
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,327
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...

966
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,122
and my brain from my skull...

967
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,169
and my arm from my body...

968
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,928
because of you.

969
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,966
You all right, son?

970
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:00,317
I...

971
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,597
I saw your girl stomp off a
little earlier in quite a huff.

972
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,118
Yeah.

973
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,504
It's fortuitous...

974
01:19:06,507 --> 01:19:08,398
you listening to this song.

975
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,438
- You know...
- Brandy?

976
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,487
By Looking Glass?

977
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,800
A favorite of your mom's.

978
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,201
Yeah, it was.

979
01:19:17,204 --> 01:19:19,438
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

980
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,193
Perhaps its very greatest.

981
01:19:21,196 --> 01:19:22,354
Yes!

982
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:25,969
Peter, you and I, we're
the sailor in that song.

983
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,478
He came on a summer's day

984
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,960
Bringing gifts from far away

985
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:37,432
Like the child I put in your mother...

986
01:19:37,435 --> 01:19:39,603
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

987
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,958
Brandy, you're a fine girl

988
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,611
What a good wife you would be

989
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,518
My life, my love

990
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,958
My lady is the sea

991
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,958
The sea calls the sailor back.

992
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,486
He loves the girl, but
that's not his place.

993
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,205
The sea calls upon him as
history calls upon great men.

994
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,927
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

995
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,838
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

996
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,158
No, Peter...

997
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,558
death will remain a
stranger to both of us...

998
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,642
as long as the light
burns within the planet.

999
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,238
I'm immortal?

1000
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,241
Mmm-hmm.

1001
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,238
Really?

1002
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,084
Yes! As long as the light exists.

1003
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:30,478
And I can use the light
to build cool things...

1004
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,453
like how you made this whole planet?

1005
01:20:32,456 --> 01:20:35,240
It might take you a few
million years of practice...

1006
01:20:35,243 --> 01:20:37,918
before you get really
good at it. But, yes!

1007
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,198
What!

1008
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:42,838
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...

1009
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,038
and Heather Locklear.

1010
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,398
You can do anything you want.

1011
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,838
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

1012
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:50,158
But you know, Peter, it is
a tremendous responsibility.

1013
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,838
Only we can remake the universe.

1014
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,478
Only we can take the
bridle of the cosmos...

1015
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,324
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1016
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,527
How?

1017
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,365
Come with me.

1018
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,398
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1019
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,970
Drax! We need to talk.

1020
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,118
I'm sorry.

1021
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,478
But I like a woman with
some meat on her bones.

1022
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,718
What?

1023
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:37,158
I tried to let you down easily by
telling you I found you disgusting.

1024
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,878
No, that's not what I...

1025
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,782
What are you doing?

1026
01:21:43,785 --> 01:21:46,638
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1027
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,454
Drax...

1028
01:21:47,457 --> 01:21:49,838
I don't like you like that.

1029
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,318
I don't even like the
type of thing you are.

1030
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,642
Hey! There's no need to get personal.

1031
01:21:54,645 --> 01:21:57,678
Listen! Ego's gotten
exactly what he wanted.

1032
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,196
I should have told you earlier.

1033
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:03,118
I'm stupid. You are in danger.

1034
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,361
What is that?

1035
01:22:12,467 --> 01:22:16,638
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

1036
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,878
Everything around us,
including the girl...

1037
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:23,518
Everything is temporary.

1038
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,598
We are forever.

1039
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,118
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1040
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,223
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...

1041
01:22:30,226 --> 01:22:32,838
which is why you're here.

1042
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,118
I told you how all those years ago...

1043
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,398
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1044
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,450
But what I did not tell you was
how, when I finally did find it...

1045
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,406
it was all so...

1046
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:50,038
disappointing.

1047
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,718
And that is when I came...

1048
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,406
to a profound realization.

1049
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,478
My innate desire to
seek out other life...

1050
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:07,644
was not so that I could
walk among that life.

1051
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,041
Peter...

1052
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,289
I have found meaning.

1053
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,525
I see it.

1054
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,158
Eternity!

1055
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,650
Oh, my God.

1056
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:55,557
We need to get off this planet.

1057
01:24:08,539 --> 01:24:10,017
Oh, man.

1058
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:12,958
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...

1059
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,850
At that time, I was
a Federal Express man.

1060
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:29,078
What the hell you doing, boy?

1061
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,318
I could tell by how
you talked about him...

1062
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,798
this Ego is bad news.

1063
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,598
We're here to save Quill.

1064
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,878
For what? Huh? For honor? For love?

1065
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,394
No. I don't care about those things.

1066
01:24:41,397 --> 01:24:44,358
I wanna save Quill so I can
prove I'm better than him!

1067
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,478
I can lord this over him forever.

1068
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,357
What are you laughing at me for?

1069
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,238
You can fool yourself and everyone
else, but you can't fool me.

1070
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,678
I know who you are.

1071
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,998
You don't know anything about me, loser.

1072
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,838
I know everything about you.

1073
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,398
I know you play like you're
the meanest and the hardest...

1074
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,167
but, actually, you're
the most scared of all.

1075
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:07,958
Shut up!

1076
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,478
I know you steal
batteries you don't need...

1077
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,901
and you push away anyone who's
willing to put up with you...

1078
01:25:12,904 --> 01:25:14,678
because just a little bit of love...

1079
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:18,358
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

1080
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,550
I said shut up!

1081
01:25:19,553 --> 01:25:23,318
I know them scientists what made
you, never gave a rat's ass about you.

1082
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,798
I'm serious, dude!

1083
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,518
Just like my own damn
parents who sold me...

1084
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,037
their own little baby, into slavery.

1085
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,478
I know who you are, boy.

1086
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,482
Because you're me.

1087
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,082
What kind of a pair are we?

1088
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,598
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.

1089
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,198
All right, okay! Good. Wait.

1090
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,486
Fight a what?

1091
01:25:56,746 --> 01:25:58,118
Who are you people?

1092
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,238
What is this place?

1093
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,398
Gamora, let her go!

1094
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,598
The bodies in the
caverns... Who are they?

1095
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,921
You are scared.

1096
01:26:08,072 --> 01:26:10,962
I call it the Expansion.

1097
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,444
It is my purpose...

1098
01:26:14,447 --> 01:26:19,447
and now it is yours as well.

1099
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,765
It's beautiful.

1100
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,438
Over thousands of years...

1101
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,758
I implanted thousands of
extensions of myself...

1102
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,638
on thousands of worlds.

1103
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,598
I need to fulfill life's
one true purpose...

1104
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,638
To grow and spread...

1105
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,958
covering all that exists...

1106
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,010
until everything is...

1107
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,401
Me!

1108
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,638
What did she do to me?

1109
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,398
She already told me everything.

1110
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,971
I only had one problem.

1111
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,758
A single Celestial
doesn't have enough power

1112
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,878
for such an enterprise.

1113
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,158
But two Celestials...

1114
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:06,482
Well, now, that just might do.

1115
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,605
The bodies...

1116
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:14,197
are his children.

1117
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,918
Out of all my labors...

1118
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,320
the most beguiling was...

1119
01:27:17,323 --> 01:27:21,518
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

1120
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,598
I hoped the result of such
a coupling would be enough...

1121
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,443
to power the Expansion.

1122
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,198
I had Yondu deliver some of them to me.

1123
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,758
It broke the Ravager code, but
I compensated him generously...

1124
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:37,678
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1125
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,438
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

1126
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,878
But one after the other, they failed me.

1127
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:47,878
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.

1128
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,041
Until you, Peter.

1129
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:53,118
Out of all my spawn...

1130
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:57,358
only you carried the
connection to the light.

1131
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,398
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

1132
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,006
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.

1133
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,798
- Then we just go.
- No!

1134
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,198
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...

1135
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,518
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.

1136
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,398
You're right.

1137
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,639
We're family.

1138
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,885
We leave no one behind.

1139
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,238
Except maybe you.

1140
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,730
Oh, my God.

1141
01:28:23,733 --> 01:28:26,678
For the first time in my existence...

1142
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:29,604
I am truly not alone!

1143
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,321
What is it, son?

1144
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,841
My friends.

1145
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:46,558
You see, that's the
mortal in you, Peter.

1146
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,838
Yes.

1147
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,078
We are beyond such things.

1148
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,081
Yes.

1149
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,640
- Now...
- But my mother...

1150
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,078
You said you loved my mother.

1151
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,605
And that I did.

1152
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,721
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.

1153
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,358
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.

1154
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16,038
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1155
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,610
I'd never leave.

1156
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,290
The Expansion...

1157
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,198
the reason for my very
existence, would be over.

1158
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,248
So, I did what I had to do.

1159
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,442
But it broke my heart to
put that tumor in her head.

1160
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,038
What?

1161
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,176
Now, all right...

1162
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:41,598
I know that sounds bad.

1163
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:57,038
Who in the hell do you think you are?

1164
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,758
You killed my mother!

1165
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,958
I tried...

1166
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,878
so hard...

1167
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,518
to find the form...

1168
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,078
that best suited you...

1169
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,713
and this is the thanks I get?

1170
01:30:09,402 --> 01:30:12,213
You really need to grow up.

1171
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,238
I wanted to do this together...

1172
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,278
but I suppose you'll have to learn

1173
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,998
by spending the next
thousand years as a battery!

1174
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,158
Finally! Rocket?

1175
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,865
Keep that transmitter
nearby, so I can find you.

1176
01:30:30,868 --> 01:30:34,226
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...

1177
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:35,958
to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.

1178
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:36,998
Ego's unhinged.

1179
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,638
I know. Get ready,

1180
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,318
Drop her, Kraglin.

1181
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,681
No.

1182
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,838
My life, my love

1183
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,047
My lady is the sea

1184
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,326
Peter...

1185
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,327
this is the sea.

1186
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,401
Oh...

1187
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,204
Hey, there, jackass!

1188
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,045
What is that thing?

1189
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,403
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1190
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:36,078
I told you something didn't feel right.

1191
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,558
"I told you so." Just what
I need to hear right now.

1192
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,244
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1193
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,358
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1194
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,598
There is no unspoken thing.

1195
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,918
What are you doing? You
could've killed us all!

1196
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,638
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?

1197
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,038
We had it under control.

1198
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,478
We did not. That is only an extension...

1199
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,678
of his true self. He will be back soon.

1200
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:56,118
What's Smurfette doing here?

1201
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,198
Whatever I need to do
to get a damn ride home.

1202
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,598
She tried to murder me!

1203
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,798
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1204
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,198
He's not a fox.

1205
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,438
- I am Groot.
- I'm not a raboon, either.

1206
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,638
I am Groot.

1207
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,051
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1208
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,038
How do we kill a Celestial?

1209
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,638
There's a center to him.

1210
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,838
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...

1211
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,478
Some sort of protective shell.

1212
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,678
It's in the caverns...

1213
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,681
below the surface.

1214
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,885
Yondu?

1215
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,963
Thrusters are out.

1216
01:33:34,966 --> 01:33:37,238
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.

1217
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,238
Otherwise, you'd have
delivered me to this maniac.

1218
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,838
You still reckon that's the reason
I kept you around, you idiot?

1219
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,958
That's what you told me, you old doofus.

1220
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:46,198
Once I figured out what
happened to them other kids...

1221
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,958
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1222
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,718
You said you were gonna eat me.

1223
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,131
That was being funny!

1224
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,318
Not to me!

1225
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,718
You people have issues.

1226
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,449
Of course I have issues.

1227
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,398
That's my freakin' father!

1228
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,970
Thrusters are back up.

1229
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,918
- We should be going up!
- We can't!

1230
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,558
Ego wants to eradicate
the universe as we know it.

1231
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,118
We have to kill him.

1232
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:22,958
Rocket!

1233
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,609
Got it!

1234
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,686
Whoo-hoo!

1235
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,878
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1236
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,078
I guess.

1237
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:42,081
Awesome!

1238
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,558
We're really gonna be able
to jack up our prices...

1239
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,358
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1240
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,118
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

1241
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:54,038
It was just a random thought,
man. I thought we were friends.

1242
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,438
Of course, I care about the
planets, and the buildings...

1243
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,358
and all the animals on the planets.

1244
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,718
And the people.

1245
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,094
Meh.

1246
01:35:01,097 --> 01:35:05,615
The crabby puppy is so
cute. He makes me wanna die!

1247
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,398
Pilots...

1248
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,975
release envoy units.

1249
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:52,090
Our sensors detect the batteries
are below the surface of the planet.

1250
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,041
Dive!

1251
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,370
Um... Captain?

1252
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,638
Captain?

1253
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,718
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1254
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:25,136
He needs my genetic
connection to the light...

1255
01:36:25,139 --> 01:36:26,918
to help destroy the universe.

1256
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,238
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

1257
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,518
So, could you?

1258
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:31,878
A little.

1259
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,278
I made a ball.

1260
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,438
A ball?

1261
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,238
I thought as hard as I could.

1262
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,958
It was all that I could come up with.

1263
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,478
You "thought"?

1264
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,718
You think when I make this arrow fly...

1265
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:44,118
I use my head?

1266
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,371
Whoa.

1267
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,278
There.

1268
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,248
That's Ego's core.

1269
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,398
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1270
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,050
I got it covered.

1271
01:37:20,261 --> 01:37:21,739
We must hurry.

1272
01:37:21,742 --> 01:37:24,048
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1273
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,566
Keep it steady.

1274
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,008
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1275
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,158
Captain?

1276
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,358
What is it, Kraglin?

1277
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,878
Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?

1278
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:52,078
- Yeah, why?
- Uh...

1279
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,518
Oh, hell!

1280
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:15,918
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1281
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,798
They blew out the generator.

1282
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,176
I think I packed a small detonator.

1283
01:38:20,179 --> 01:38:22,478
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

1284
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,970
Well, we got these.

1285
01:38:24,432 --> 01:38:26,869
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1286
01:38:26,872 --> 01:38:28,998
If it is, it'll cause
a chain reaction...

1287
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,878
throughout his entire nervous system.

1288
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:31,838
Meaning what?

1289
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,518
The entire planet will explode.

1290
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,118
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1291
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,724
I rigged a timer.

1292
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,761
Go!

1293
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,689
He's coming.

1294
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,358
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?

1295
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,918
When he wants. He's too powerful.

1296
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,758
I can't!

1297
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,649
You don't have to believe in yourself...

1298
01:39:04,652 --> 01:39:07,598
because I believe in you.

1299
01:39:19,463 --> 01:39:20,658
Sleep!

1300
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,918
I never thought she'd
be able to do it...

1301
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,161
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.

1302
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:36,004
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1303
01:39:38,944 --> 01:39:40,822
The metal's too thick.

1304
01:39:40,825 --> 01:39:44,638
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.

1305
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:47,597
And our fat butts ain't gonna
fit through those tiny holes.

1306
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,601
Well...

1307
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,398
That's a terrible idea.

1308
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,687
Which is the only kind
of idea we have left.

1309
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,318
Unbelievable.

1310
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,527
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."

1311
01:40:01,528 --> 01:40:03,610
What a day.

1312
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:14,651
All right, first you flick
this switch, then this switch.

1313
01:40:14,654 --> 01:40:16,278
That activates it.

1314
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:18,278
Then you push this button...

1315
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,478
which will give you five
minutes to get out of there.

1316
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,023
Now, whatever you do...

1317
01:40:23,026 --> 01:40:25,958
don't push this button...

1318
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:28,118
because that will set
off the bomb immediately

1319
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:29,718
and we'll all be dead.

1320
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:32,318
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1321
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,278
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1322
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,398
- I am Groot.
- That's right.

1323
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,958
- I am Groot.
- No!

1324
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,438
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!

1325
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,622
Try again.

1326
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:43,841
Hmm...

1327
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,478
- I am Groot.
- Mmm-hmm.

1328
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,718
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1329
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:49,798
I am Groot.

1330
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,798
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1331
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,558
How is that even possible?

1332
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,633
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

1333
01:40:55,636 --> 01:40:57,198
Point to it.

1334
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,518
No!

1335
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,438
Hey, you're making him nervous!

1336
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,358
Shut up and get me some tape!

1337
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,878
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1338
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,798
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

1339
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,838
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

1340
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:11,638
Yo, Yondu... Ow!

1341
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:14,038
Do you have any tape?

1342
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:19,318
Gamora? Do you have any tape?

1343
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,518
Tape!

1344
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,966
Never mind. Ow!

1345
01:41:23,879 --> 01:41:26,477
Drax, do you have any tape?

1346
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:29,438
Yes, Scotch tape would work.

1347
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,518
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,

1348
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,010
if you don't have any?

1349
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,438
Nobody has any tape!

1350
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:36,994
Not a single person has tape?

1351
01:41:36,997 --> 01:41:38,103
Nope!

1352
01:41:38,106 --> 01:41:39,486
Did you ask Nebula?

1353
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,238
Yes!

1354
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:42,678
Are you sure?

1355
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:43,647
I asked Yondu...

1356
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:46,398
- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!

1357
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,402
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1358
01:41:49,405 --> 01:41:51,238
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1359
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,958
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1360
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,440
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1361
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,046
Whee!

1362
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,723
We're all gonna die.

1363
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,798
Rear thrusters are out again!

1364
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:12,485
We're done for without that generator!

1365
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,080
Guardians...

1366
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,967
perhaps it will provide you solace...

1367
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:32,878
that your deaths are
not without purpose.

1368
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,598
They will serve as a warning...

1369
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,518
to all of those tempted
with betraying us.

1370
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,330
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1371
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,318
This is gonna hurt.

1372
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,845
Promises, promises.

1373
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,558
Hey!

1374
01:43:09,919 --> 01:43:11,517
No!

1375
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,648
No! No! No!

1376
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,233
We're gonna blow!

1377
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,700
Peter! No!

1378
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,558
What?

1379
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,718
You look like Mary Poppins.

1380
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,131
Is he cool?

1381
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,570
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1382
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,209
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1383
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:27,608
Mantis, look out!

1384
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,324
She's just unconscious.

1385
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,078
How long until the bomb goes off?

1386
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:01,598
In the unlikely event that
Groot doesn't kill us all...

1387
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:02,761
about six minutes.

1388
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:10,478
Kraglin, we need the
quadrant for an extraction.

1389
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:11,638
T-minus five minutes.

1390
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:12,801
Aye, Captain.

1391
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:19,204
Somebody's gotta be up
top when Kraglin arrives.

1392
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,365
Drax, take Mantis.

1393
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,958
Ow! My nipples!

1394
01:45:33,707 --> 01:45:34,913
Gamora!

1395
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:40,038
Peter!

1396
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,459
Get over it.

1397
01:46:07,462 --> 01:46:11,601
Come now, Peter. I know
this isn't what you want.

1398
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:18,678
What kind of father would I
be to let you make this choice?

1399
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,758
Yeah!

1400
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,401
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

1401
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,163
So stop pissing me off!

1402
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,509
We have to get up to
the extraction point!

1403
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,687
Go!

1404
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,318
I told you...

1405
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:32,732
I don't want to do this alone.

1406
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:38,008
You cannot deny...

1407
01:49:38,011 --> 01:49:41,844
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

1408
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,958
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

1409
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,961
What is that?

1410
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,927
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

1411
01:50:13,688 --> 01:50:17,084
Why are you destroying our chance?

1412
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,969
Stop pretending you aren't what you are.

1413
01:50:24,964 --> 01:50:25,965
One in billions.

1414
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,478
Trillions. Even more.

1415
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:36,605
What greater meaning can
life possibly have to offer?

1416
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:43,478
I don't use my head
to fly the arrow, boy!

1417
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:45,369
I use my heart...

1418
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:24,478
You shouldn't have killed my
mom, and squished my Walkman.

1419
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,718
Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up!

1420
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:11,238
I'm not sure how long Quill
can keep him distracted!

1421
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:12,810
Groot, hurry!

1422
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,998
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1423
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,518
Get to the ship!

1424
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:13,998
Not without Quill!

1425
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,889
You need to take care of the twig!

1426
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,969
Not without you!

1427
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:23,522
I ain't done nothin' right
my whole damn life, rat.

1428
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:29,008
You need to give me this.

1429
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:38,241
Uh...

1430
01:53:39,319 --> 01:53:41,997
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1431
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,082
I only have one of each.

1432
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,970
I am Groot.

1433
01:53:58,760 --> 01:53:59,841
What's that?

1434
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:06,358
He says, "Welcome to the
frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy."

1435
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:08,647
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

1436
01:54:14,972 --> 01:54:16,041
Bye, twig.

1437
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:21,442
We're gonna need to have a real
discussion about your language.

1438
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,161
Where's Peter?

1439
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,968
Rocket, where is he?

1440
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:21,838
Rocket.

1441
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,410
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

1442
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:27,041
Mmm...

1443
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,207
No. I'm not leaving without him.

1444
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,201
I'm sorry.

1445
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,358
I can only afford to
lose one friend today.

1446
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:46,237
Kraglin, go!

1447
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:47,241
Wait...

1448
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,570
Is Quill back?

1449
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:53,526
Rocket, where's Quill?

1450
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:57,928
Rocket, where's Quill?

1451
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:00,320
Rocket!

1452
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:02,202
Where's Quill?

1453
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:06,558
Where's Quill?

1454
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,376
No, we need to stop it.

1455
01:56:16,379 --> 01:56:17,831
We need to stop it.

1456
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:23,087
Stop.

1457
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,638
Stop. Listen to me!

1458
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,165
You are a god.

1459
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:30,238
If you kill me...

1460
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:32,720
you'll be just like everybody else.

1461
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:35,638
What's so wrong with that?

1462
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,562
No!

1463
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,518
He may have been your father, boy,

1464
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:30,965
but he wasn't your daddy.

1465
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,681
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1466
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:41,047
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1467
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,326
What?

1468
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,238
Yondu, what are you doing?

1469
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:00,366
You can't.

1470
01:58:02,038 --> 01:58:03,039
Yondu!

1471
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,005
No!

1472
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,522
No!

1473
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:18,204
Oh! Aww...

1474
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:21,406
No! No!

1475
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:24,043
Oh, no!

1476
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,478
I told Gamora...

1477
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,478
how when I was a kid I used to pretend

1478
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:24,289
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1479
01:59:26,518 --> 01:59:29,688
He's a singer and actor from
Earth, really famous guy.

1480
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:33,209
Earlier, it struck me...

1481
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:39,158
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.

1482
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:41,598
He didn't have the beautiful
voice of an angel...

1483
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:43,958
but he did have the whistle of one.

1484
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:47,598
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

1485
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,318
and hooked up with hot women...

1486
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,288
and fought robots.

1487
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,158
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind
of end up being my dad after all.

1488
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:00,858
Only it was you, Yondu.

1489
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:08,809
I had a pretty cool dad.

1490
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:14,451
What I'm trying to say here is...

1491
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:20,128
sometimes that thing you're
searching for your whole life...

1492
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:24,958
it's right there by your side all along.

1493
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,769
You don't even know it.

1494
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,325
I am Groot.

1495
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,484
He did call you twig.

1496
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:47,251
Nebula...

1497
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,168
I was a child like you.

1498
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:59,358
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

1499
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:02,518
And I never considered what
Thanos was doing to you.

1500
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,438
I'm trying to make it right.

1501
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:05,998
There are little girls like you...

1502
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,844
across the universe who are in danger.

1503
02:01:11,125 --> 02:01:13,010
You can stay with us and help them.

1504
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:16,158
I will help them by killing Thanos.

1505
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:18,208
I don't know if that's possible.

1506
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:35,248
You will always be my sister.

1507
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:20,807
Pete!

1508
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:26,158
Captain found this for
you in a junker shop.

1509
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:29,004
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.

1510
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,078
What is it?

1511
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,078
It's called a Zune.

1512
02:02:33,081 --> 02:02:35,481
It's what everybody's
listening to on Earth nowadays.

1513
02:02:35,484 --> 02:02:36,838
It's got 300 songs on it.

1514
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:39,127
300 songs?

1515
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,361
Wait.

1516
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,518
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

1517
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:55,966
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

1518
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:00,725
Thanks...

1519
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:03,800
Captain.

1520
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:17,211
They came.

1521
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:26,725
What is it?

1522
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:29,998
I sent word to Yondu's
old Ravager buddies,

1523
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,445
and told them what he did.

1524
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,929
It's a Ravager funeral.

1525
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,917
Yeah!

1526
02:04:56,003 --> 02:04:57,410
Yeah!

1527
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,603
He didn't let us down
after all, Captain.

1528
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,364
No, he did not, son.

1529
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,805
He did not.

1530
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:21,803
Fare thee well, old friend.

1531
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:28,928
Yondu Udonta, I will
see you in the stars.

1532
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,118
He didn't chase them away.

1533
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:36,246
No.

1534
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,478
Even though he yelled at them.

1535
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:41,460
And was always mean.

1536
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:45,768
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

1537
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:52,970
Well, of course not.

1538
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:18,321
What?

1539
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,161
It's just...

1540
02:06:22,636 --> 02:06:24,477
some unspoken thing.

1541
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:36,688
It's beautiful.

1542
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:39,366
It is.

1543
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:43,008
And so are you.

1544
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,240
On the inside.

1545
02:07:15,969 --> 02:07:22,531

1546
02:08:41,797 --> 02:08:43,480
You know, it's a shame...

1547
02:08:43,483 --> 02:08:48,118
that it took the tragedy of losing
Yondu to bring us all together again.

1548
02:08:48,127 --> 02:08:51,997
But I think he'd be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.

1549
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,238
I'm in.

1550
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:54,238
Dope.

1551
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:56,478
I miss you guys so much!

1552
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:57,686
Hell, yes.

1553
02:09:00,635 --> 02:09:02,558
What say we steal some shit?

1554
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:24,888
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

1555
02:11:24,891 --> 02:11:28,163
They are perturbed I've
wasted our resources.

1556
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:34,922
When they see what
I have created here...

1557
02:11:34,925 --> 02:11:36,893
their wrath will dissipate.

1558
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:42,204
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

1559
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:44,998
That, my child...

1560
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,998
is the next step in our evolution.

1561
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,318
More powerful, more beautiful...

1562
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:54,370
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1563
02:11:56,914 --> 02:11:59,360
I think I shall call him...

1564
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:02,731
Adam.

1565
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:06,165
Ugh, dude.

1566
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:08,446
Seriously?

1567
02:14:08,449 --> 02:14:10,958
You gotta clean up your
room. It's a complete mess.

1568
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,558
I am Groot.

1569
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:14,391
I am not boring. You're boring.

1570
02:14:14,394 --> 02:14:15,638
You know what's boring?

1571
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:18,958
Sitting there, playing
that mind-numbing game.

1572
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:23,078
What's boring is me tripping
over your vines every day!

1573
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,478
I'm not boring!

1574
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:26,127
I am Groot.

1575
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:29,220
And now I know how Yondu felt.

1576
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:07,687
In these times of hardship...

1577
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,848
just remember...

1578
02:15:11,347 --> 02:15:15,397
We. Are. Groot.

1579
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,158
Hey, fellas.

1580
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,998
Wait, where are you going?

1581
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,518
You were supposed to be my lift home.

1582
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:26,358
How will I get out of here?

1583
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:27,758
Hey! Aw, gee...

1584
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:30,678
I've got so many more stories to tell.

1585
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:32,038
Aw, guys.

1586
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:33,588
Oh, gee...
