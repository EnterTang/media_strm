00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,260
卡西利亚斯法师
<b>Master Kaecilius.</b>

2
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,230
那个仪式依我看只会害了你
<b>That ritual will bring you only sorrow.</b>

3
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,430
伪君子
<b>Hypocrite!</b>

4
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,170
来个有难度的 比利
<b>Challenge round, Billy.</b>

5
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,220
噢 比利 别跟我开玩笑了
<b>Oh, come on, Billy, you've got to be messing with me.</b>

6
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,760
没开玩笑
<b>No, doctor.</b>

7
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,850
如沐春风 查克·曼卓林 1977年
<b>Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977.</b>

8
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,640
说真的 比利 来个难点儿的
<b>Honestly, Billy, you said this one would be hard.</b>

9
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,720
- 是1978年 - 肯定不是
<b>- Ha! it's 1978. - No, Billy.</b>

10
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,400
虽然如沐春风是1978年上的排行榜
<b>While Feels So Good may have charted in 1978...</b>

11
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,940
但这张专辑可是1977年12月发售的
<b>the album was released in December of 1977.</b>

12
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,700
不 维基百科说
<b>No. Wikipedia says it's a nineteen...</b>

13
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,820
再查查吧
<b>Check again.</b>

14
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,200
你的脑子里怎么装了这么多没用的东西
<b>Where do you store all this useless information?</b>

15
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,280
没用
<b>Useless?</b>

16
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,070
这哥们儿凭一把小号就吹进排行榜前十了
<b>The man charted a top 10 hit with a flugeihorn.</b>

17
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,110
查好了吗 比利
<b>Status, Billy?</b>

18
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,280
1977年
<b>1977.</b>

19
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,670
- 果然是 - 真受不了
<b>- Oh, please. - I hate you.</b>

20
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,960
噢
<b>Oh!</b>

21
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,960
真是如沐春风 是不是
<b>Feels so good, doesn't it?</b>

22
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,130
我来接手 史蒂芬
<b>Oh, I got this, Stephen.</b>

23
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,090
你的任务完成了 撤吧 我们收尾
<b>Youve done your bit. Go ahead. Well close up.</b>

24
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,170
什么情况
<b>What is it?</b>

25
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,430
应该是枪伤
<b>GSW.</b>

26
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,970
他竟然还活着
<b>it's amazing you kept him alive.</b>

27
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,910
呼吸暂停 脑干检查
<b>Apneic, failed the brain stem test...</b>

28
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,100
和呼吸反应检查都失败
<b>and the apnea reflex test.</b>

29
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,810
我知道问题在哪儿了 帕尔默医生
<b>I think I found the problem, Doctor Palmer.</b>

30
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,560
还有颗子弹没取出来
<b>You left a bullet in his head.</b>

31
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,270
谢谢 可能是伤到了延髓
<b>Thanks. it's impinging on the medulla.</b>

32
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,860
我需要一位专家 尼克诊断他脑死亡
<b>I needed a specialist. Nic diagnosed brain death.</b>

33
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,690
可我真的觉得不大对劲儿
<b>Something about that doesn't feel right to me.</b>

34
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,770
那咱们得抓紧
<b>We have to run.</b>

35
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,320
韦斯特医生
<b>Doctor West.</b>

36
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,820
你在干什么 嗨
<b>What are you doing? Hey.</b>

37
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,320
取器官 他是捐献者
<b>Organ harvest. He's a donor.</b>

38
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,950
慢着 这事我还没同意呢
<b>Slow down. I did not agree to that.</b>

39
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,120
不需要你同意 已经确认他脑死亡了
<b>I don't need you to. Weve already called brain death.</b>

40
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,370
结论太早了 我们要给他准备枕下开颅手术
<b>Prematurely. We need to get him prepped for sub-occipital craniotomy.</b>

41
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,290
我不会让你在一个死人身上做手术的
<b>Not gonna let you operate on a dead man.</b>

42
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,830
你看这个
<b>What do you see?</b>

43
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,880
- 这是子弹 - 完整的子弹
<b>- A bullet? - A perfect bullet.</b>

44
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,860
加强过的
<b>it's been hardened.</b>

45
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,800
由金属铅和金属锑加强过的子弹
<b>You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony.</b>

46
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,630
是有毒合金 当其毒性直接进入脑脊髓液之后
<b>A toxic metal. And that's leeched directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.</b>

47
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,430
急性发病 中枢神经停止反射
<b>Rapid onset central nervous system shutdown.</b>

48
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,510
我们走吧
<b>We gotta go.</b>

49
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,100
病人是濒临死亡
<b>The patient's not dead, but he is dying.</b>

50
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,600
还要取他的器官吗
<b>Still want to harvest his organs?</b>

51
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,020
- 要不要我来帮你 - 不
<b>- I'll assist you. - No.</b>

52
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,140
帕尔默医生会帮我的
<b>Doctor Palmer will assist me.</b>

53
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,960
谢谢
<b>Thank you.</b>

54
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,210
马上进行影像导航
<b>Image guidance, stat.</b>

55
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,880
我看没时间了
<b>We don't have time for that.</b>

56
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,670
你不能直接上手
<b>You cant do it freehand.</b>

57
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,010
我当然能上手
<b>I can and I will.</b>

58
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,930
这可不是你炫耀的时候 斯特兰奇
<b>This isn't a time for showing off, Strange.</b>

59
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,850
是谁十分钟前宣布他已经死亡了的
<b>How about 10 minutes ago when you called the wrong time of death?</b>

60
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,400
颅内神经完好
<b>Cranial nenies intact.</b>

61
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,720
韦斯特医生 你手表声太大
<b>Doctor West, cover your watch.</b>

62
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,060
其实 你犯不着在众人面前羞辱尼克
<b>You know, you didn't have to humiliate him in front of everyone.</b>

63
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,640
我也犯不着去管他的病人
<b>I didn't have to save his patient, either.</b>

64
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,440
你知道 我就是有点情不自禁
<b>But I sometimes just can't help myself.</b>

65
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,890
尼克是个好医生
<b>Nic is a great doctor.</b>

66
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,150
可你找了我
<b>You came to me.</b>

67
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,600
我只是需要有人帮我做二次诊断
<b>Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.</b>

68
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,780
你早就有二次诊断了
<b>You had a second opinion.</b>

69
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,280
你要的是更权威的诊断
<b>What you needed was a competent one.</b>

70
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,570
你就当我随时待命的神经外科医生吧
<b>Well, all the more reason why you should be my neurosurgeon on call.</b>

71
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,120
你可以拯救很多生命
<b>You could make such a difference.</b>

72
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,780
我可不进你那个屠宰场
<b>I can't work in your butcher shop.</b>

73
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,950
嗨
<b>Hey!</b>

74
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,120
更何况我做的是断裂脊髓融合
<b>I'm fusing transected spinal cords.</b>

75
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,370
是刺激中枢神经系统再生
<b>I'm stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system.</b>

76
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,750
我的工作在未来能会拯救上千人
<b>The work I'm doing is gonna save thousands for years to come.</b>

77
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,250
在急救室 你救的是拿着枪的醉汉
<b>In ER, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.</b>

78
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,370
对 你说得没错
<b>Yeah, youre right.</b>

79
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,920
在急救室里我们只能忙着救人
<b>In ER, were only saving lives.</b>

80
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,550
没名气 也没有 电视台采访
<b>There's no fame, there's no, uh, CNN interviews.</b>

81
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,500
看来我还是跟尼克凑合好了
<b>I guess III just have to stick with Nic.</b>

82
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,630
不 等一下
<b>Whoa, wait a minute.</b>

83
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,960
你们俩 不会是已经
<b>You're not... You guys aren't...</b>

84
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,300
什么
<b>What?</b>

85
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,440
那样了吧 抱歉
<b>Sleeping together? Sorry,</b>

86
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,140
我觉得我已经把意思表达清楚了
<b>I thought that was implicit in my disgust.</b>

87
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,770
嗨嗨嗨 说清楚哪样了
<b>Explicit, actually.</b>

88
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,100
我的原则是绝对不和同事约会
<b>No, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues.</b>

89
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,180
是吗
<b>Oh, really?</b>

90
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,360
我叫管这叫斯特兰奇原则
<b>I call it the Strange Policy."</b>

91
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,980
真好 能有以我的名字命名的东西很好
<b>Oh, well, good, I'm glad somethings named after me.</b>

92
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,400
你知道 我首创了椎板切除术
<b>I invented a laminectomy procedure.</b>

93
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,190
为什么就是没人愿意把它叫做斯特兰奇术
<b>And yet, somehow no one seems to want to call it the "Strange Technique."</b>

94
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,900
是我们一起创立的这项技术
<b>We invented that technique.</b>

95
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,490
是 不管怎么说 你的那个原则让我受宠若惊
<b>Regardless, I'm very flattered by your policy.</b>

96
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,830
我要在今晚神经学协会举办的晚宴上演讲
<b>I'm talking tonight at a Neurological Society dinner.</b>

97
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,240
和我一起去
<b>Come with me.</b>

98
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,200
有演讲要演 还真是浪漫
<b>Another speaking engagement? So romantic.</b>

99
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,210
你不是挺喜欢和我浪漫的吗
<b>You used to love coming to those things with me.</b>

100
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,540
那会儿我们多开心
<b>We had fun together.</b>

101
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,300
不 只有你开心而已
<b>No! You had fun.</b>

102
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,170
那些事只对你有好处
<b>They weren't about us, they were about you.</b>

103
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,340
不仅是对我吧
<b>Not only about me.</b>

104
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,430
史蒂芬 这世界是围着你转的
<b>Stephen. Everything is about you.</b>

105
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,930
把咱们的名字连在一起
<b>Maybe we could hyphenate.</b>

106
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,100
斯特兰奇-帕尔默技术
<b>Strange-Palmer Technique.</b>

107
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,060
我的名字应该在前面
<b>Palmer-Strange.</b>

108
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,400
比利
<b>Billy.</b>

109
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,740
有什么需要我的
<b>What have you got for me?</b>

110
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,110
我这儿有一位35岁的空军上校
<b>I've got a 35-year-old Air Force Colonel..</b>

111
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,360
低位脊椎被某种实验装置压碎
<b>crushed his lower spine in some kind of experimental armor.</b>

112
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,820
胸椎中段爆裂性骨折
<b>Mid-thoracic burst fracture.</b>

113
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,370
好吧 这个我能做
<b>Yeah, well, I could help...</b>

114
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,660
而且你随便找谁都能做
<b>but so could 50 other people.</b>

115
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,290
给我找点刺激的 别浪费我时间
<b>Find me something worth my time.</b>

116
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,990
我这儿还有一个68岁的女性
<b>I have a 68-year-old female</b>

117
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,750
患有晚期脑干胶质瘤
<b>with an advanced brain stem glioma.</b>

118
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,580
你想毁了我一世英名吗
<b>Yeah, you want me to screw up my perfect record?</b>

119
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,130
我才不要呢
<b>Definitely not.</b>

120
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,340
还有个22岁的女性
<b>How about a 22-year-old female...</b>

<b>with an electronic implant in her brain to control schizophrenia...</b>

122
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,100
结果被闪电击中了
<b>struck by lightning?</b>

123
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,720
嗯 这个听起来有点意思
<b>Mmm. That does sound interesting.</b>

124

<b>it's okay. it's gonna be okay.</b>

128
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,560
他们给我做了什么
<b>What did they do?</b>

129
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,020
他们用直升机送你来的
<b>They rushed you in a chopper.</b>

130
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,190
花了很多时间才找到你
<b>But it took a little while to find you.</b>

131
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,050
可是你已经错过了
<b>The golden hours for nerve damage went</b>

132
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,440
治疗神经损伤的黄金时间
<b>by while you were in the car.</b>

133
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,200
他们给我做了什么
<b>What did they do?</b>

134
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,070
十一根不锈钢钢钉插进了骨头里
<b>11 stainless steel pins in the bones.</b>

135
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,120
多处韧带撕裂
<b>Multiple torn ligaments...</b>

136
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,300
双手神经严重损伤
<b>severe nerve damage in both hands.</b>

137
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,800
手术整整持续了十一个小时
<b>You were on the table for 11 hours.</b>

138
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,800
看看这些固定器
<b>Look at these fixators.</b>

139
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,390
没有人能做得更好了
<b>No one could have done better.</b>

140
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,730
我可以做得更好
<b>I could have done better.</b>

141
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,330
不
<b>No.</b>

142
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,090
你得耐心等待身体恢复
<b>Give your body time to heal.</b>

143
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,510
你彻底把我给毁了
<b>You've ruined me.</b>

144
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,020
需要多久我才能
<b>How long until I can take...</b>

145
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,090
斯特兰奇医生
<b>Doctor Strange.</b>

146
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,890
那些软组织还在恢复中
<b>Those tissues are still healing.</b>

147
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,020
那加个速
<b>So, speed it up.</b>

148
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,860
用支架从肱动脉进入桡动脉
<b>Pass a stent down the brachial artery into the radial artery.</b>

149
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,930
可能行
<b>it's possible.</b>

150
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,990
虽然是实验阶段 而且价格不菲 但可行
<b>Experimental and expensive, but possible.</b>

151
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,990
我需要的就是可行
<b>All I need is possible.</b>

152
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,550
往上抬
<b>Up.</b>

153
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,010
往上
<b>Up.</b>

154
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,510
让我看到你的用力
<b>Show me your strength.</b>

155
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,320
这根本没用
<b>This is useless.</b>

156
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,560
有用 哥们儿 你可以的
<b>it's not useless, man. You can do this.</b>

157
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,080
你老实回答我 本科高材生
<b>All right, answer me this, bachelors degree.</b>

158
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,820
你见过神经损伤这么重
<b>Have you ever known anyone with nerve damage</b>

159
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,500
用这个治疗方法
<b>this severe to do this...</b>

160
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,830
最后还能恢复的人吗
<b>and actually recover?</b>

161
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,450
还真有一个
<b>One guy, yeah.</b>

162
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,000
工伤事故 背部受伤 瘫痪
<b>Factory accident, broke his back...</b>

163
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,500
一条腿彻底残废
<b>paralyzed, his leg wasted away.</b>

164
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,920
坐在轮椅上 他肩膀都疼
<b>He had pain in his shoulder, from the wheelchair.</b>

165
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,550
他每周来做三次康复
<b>He came in three times a week.</b>

166
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,890
后来就不来了
<b>Then one day he stopped coming.</b>

167
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,930
我以为他死了
<b>I thought he was dead.</b>

168
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,100
几年后在街上 他从我身边走过
<b>A few years later, he walked past me on the street.</b>

169
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,680
- 走过 - 是啊 没错
<b>- Walked? - Yeah, walked.</b>

170
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,640
胡扯 我要看他的医疗记录
<b>Bullshit. Show me his file.</b>

171
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,440
你以为调医疗记录那么容易吗
<b>Itli take me a while to pull the files from the archive.</b>

172
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,940
能让你这自负的混蛋闭嘴
<b>But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong...</b>

173
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,690
也值了
<b>Worth it.</b>

174
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,620
听着 我看了你所有的研究
<b>hooked at all your research..</b>

175
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,920
阅读了你提供的所有文献
<b>I read all the papers you've sent.</b>

176
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,800
这根本行不通
<b>It's not gonna work.</b>

177
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,380
你可能都没明白
<b>I don't think you realize...</b>

178
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,040
- 你伤得有多重 - 听我说 我想说的是
<b>- how severe the damages are. - Here's the thing...</b>

179
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,220
现在连最好的医生都无力回天了
<b>The best have tried and failed.</b>

180
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,140
是 我 我明白 只是问题在于我
<b>I understand. Heres the thing.</b>

181
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,350
说真的 这件事我帮不了你 史蒂芬
<b>What you want from me is impossible, Stephen.</b>

182
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,720
行了
<b>Come on.</b>

183
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,560
我得为我的名誉着想啊
<b>I've got my own reputation to consider.</b>

184
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,440
- 别这样 艾迪安 等等 - 我真的帮不了你
<b>- Etienne, wait. No. - l can't help you.</b>

185
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,770
不 不 等等
<b>No, no, wait!</b>

186
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,980
嗨
<b>Hey!</b>

187
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,950
他不愿意
<b>He won't do it.</b>

188
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,910
庸医
<b>He's a hack.</b>

189
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,580
在东京有种新技术
<b>There is a new procedure in Tokyo.</b>

190
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,460
他们培育升级供体干细胞
<b>They culture donor stem cells... and then harvesting them</b>

191
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,010
然后用三维打印染色体骨架
<b>and then 3D printing a scaffold.</b>

192
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,170
可是我得先筹一笔钱
<b>If I could get a loan together...</b>

193
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,340
史蒂芬
<b>Stephen.</b>

194
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,050
不多 费用才二十万
<b>A small loan, just$200,000.</b>

195
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,220
史蒂芬 你总是赚多少钱就花多少钱
<b>You've always spent money as fast as you could make it...</b>

196
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,350
你现在完全就是在透支啊
<b>but now youre spending money you don't even have.</b>

197
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,140
是不应该考虑放弃了
<b>Maybe it's time to consider stopping.</b>

198
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,600
不 不 现在绝对不是该放弃的时候
<b>No, now is exactly the time not to stop...</b>

199
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,440
你看到了 我根本就没有好起来
<b>because, you see, I'm not getting any better!</b>

200
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,440
你现在已经不是在治病了
<b>But this isnt medicine anymore.</b>

201
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,280
又何必执着呢
<b>This is mania.</b>

202
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,020
有些事你是无能为力的
<b>Some things just can't be fixed.</b>

203
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,860
没有事业的人生
<b>Life without my work...</b>

204
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,650
那也是人生啊
<b>Is still life.</b>

205
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,870
又不是世界末日
<b>This isnt the end.</b>

206
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,820
总会有别的东西让你的生命充满意义
<b>There are other things that can give your life meaning.</b>

207
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,710
比如什么 你
<b>Like what? Like you?</b>

208
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,460
你现在应该向我道歉
<b>This is the part where you apologize.</b>

209
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,420
你现在应该转身离开
<b>This is the part where you leave.</b>

210
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,960
好吧 反正我已经看不下去你这个样子了
<b>Fine, I can't watch you do this to yourself anymore.</b>

211
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,300
你看不下去了 是吗
<b>Oh, too difficult for you, is it?</b>

212
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,640
是的
<b>Yes, it is.</b>

213
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,970
我难受 看到你这样我的心都快碎了
<b>It breaks my heart to see you this way.</b>

214
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,290
不要你可怜我
<b>No, don't pity me.</b>

215
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,220
我没有可怜我
<b>I'm not pitying you.</b>

216
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,550
那你来这儿干嘛
<b>Oh, yeah? Then what are you doing here...</b>

217
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,890
带着奶酪和红酒 好像我们是要去野餐的老朋友
<b>bringing cheese and wine like we're old friends going for a picnic?</b>

218
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,310
我们根本不是朋友 克丽丝汀
<b>We are not friends, Christine.</b>

219
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,730
也谈不上恋人
<b>We were barely lovers.</b>

220
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,650
你就喜欢看悲剧
<b>But you just love a sob story, don't you?</b>

221
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,110
你看我就是个悲剧嘛
<b>Is that what I am to you now?</b>

222
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,860
可怜的史蒂芬 看他多可怜
<b>"Poor Stephen Strange, charity case."</b>

223
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,060
他终于需要我了
<b>"He finally needs me."</b>

224
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,870
又一个社会的弃儿需要你拯救
<b>Another dreg of humanity for you to work on.</b>

225
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,320
用心开导开导
<b>Patch him up and send him back into the world...</b>

226
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,900
再重新开始人生
<b>heart's just humming.</b>

227
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,330
你高兴得恨不得唱起歌来 是不是
<b>You care so much, don't you?</b>

228
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,830
再见 史蒂芬
<b>Goodbye, Stephen.</b>

229
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,190
史蒂芬·斯特兰奇

230
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,210
医疗报告

231
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,800
告诉过你了

好球
<b>Yeah! All day.</b>

236
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,050
加油啊 哥们儿 多好的比赛
<b>Come on, manl Where's the competition?</b>

237
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,570
真是话唠
<b>Talk a lot.</b>

238
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,770
乔纳森·潘博恩
<b>Jonathan Pangborn...</b>

颈7颈8两段脊髓完全损伤
<b>C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.</b>

240
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,660
你是谁
<b>Who are you?</b>

241
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,730
胸部以下瘫痪
<b>Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.</b>

双手部分也已经瘫痪
<b>Partial paralysis in both hands.</b>

243
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,810
我不认识你
<b>l don't know you.</b>

244
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,740
史蒂芬·斯特兰奇
<b>I'm Stephen Strange.</b>

245
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,910
神经外科医生 曾经是神经外科医生
<b>I'm a neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon.</b>

246
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,620
我想起来了 哥们儿 我还真认识你
<b>Actually, you know what, man, I do know you.</b>

247
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,500
我去过你的办公室 你连见都不见我
<b>I came to your office once. You refused to see me.</b>

248
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,090
你助理那关我都过不去
<b>I never got past your assistant.</b>

249
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,260
我根本救不了你
<b>You were untreatable.</b>

250
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,750
你那叫知难而退 对吧
<b>No glory for you in that, right?</b>

251
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,010
你从绝望中找到了希望 还创造了奇迹
<b>You came back from a place there's no way back from.</b>

252
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,680
我 我也在试着创造我的奇迹
<b>I'm trying to find my own way back.</b>

253
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,690

<b>Pang born, are you in or you out?</b>

好吧
<b>All right.</b>

255
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,580
我当时已经想放弃了
<b>Id given up on my body.</b>

256
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,960
我以为只有我的大脑还在正常运转
<b>I thought my mind's the only thing I have left...</b>

257
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,000
那应该让它锻炼一下
<b>I should at least try to elevate that.</b>

258
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,420
我和一群法师圣女在一起学习
<b>So, I sat with gurus... and sacred women.</b>

259
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,460
一群陌生人抬着我上山 面见圣人们
<b>Strangers carried me to mountaintops to see holy men.</b>

260
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,630
最终
<b>And finally...</b>

261
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,470
我找到了我的导师
<b>I found my teacher.</b>

262
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,130
我这儿进入了全新的境界
<b>And my mind was elevated...</b>

263
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,470
我的灵魂也得到了升华
<b>and my spirit deepened.</b>

264
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,430
然后 不知怎么
<b>And somehow...</b>

265
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,600
你的身体就痊愈了
<b>Your body healed.</b>

266
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,810
是的
<b>Yes.</b>

267
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,440
那里还有很多奥秘
<b>There were deeper secrets to learn there...</b>

268
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,150
但我没有足够的精力继续学习了
<b>but I didn't have the strength to receive them.</b>

269
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,240
既然奇迹已经降临 我就决定乖乖地回家了
<b>I chose to settle for my miracle and I came back home.</b>

270
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,710
你要找的地方叫做卡玛泰基
<b>The place you're looking for is called Kamar-Taj.</b>

271
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,120
但去那儿很贵
<b>But the cost there is high.</b>

272
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,120
要多少钱
<b>How much?</b>

273
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,870
这个和钱无关
<b>I'm not talking about money.</b>

274
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,340
祝你好运
<b>Good luck.</b>

275
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,630
来继续 传球
<b>Let's ball. All right, ball up!</b>

276
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,360
尼泊尔 加德满都

277
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,870
呃 卡玛泰基
<b>Uh, Kamar-Taj?</b>

278
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,610
你知道卡玛泰基在哪儿吗
<b>You know where Kamar-Taj is?</b>

279
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,220
喜马拉雅治疗所！找到安宁！ 找到自我！

280
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,060
卡玛泰基
<b>Kamar-Taj?</b>

281
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,900
卡玛泰基
<b>Kamar-Taj.</b>

282
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,470
噢 天呐
<b>Okay.</b>

283
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,090
不好意思 各位 我 我没有带钱
<b>Look, guys, I don't have any money.</b>

284
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,850
手表给我
<b>Your watch.</b>

285
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,140
不 别这样 我 我只剩下这块表了
<b>No, please. it's all I have left.</b>

286
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,350
把手表给我
<b>Your watch.</b>

287
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,940
好吧
<b>All right.</b>

288
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,310
你在找卡玛泰基
<b>You're looking for Kamar-Taj.</b>

289
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,180
这儿
<b>Really?</b>

290
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,260
你确定是这儿吗
<b>Sure we got the right place?</b>

291
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,520
那个地方才更像 卡玛泰基
<b>That one looks a little more Kamar-Tajey.</b>

292
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,070
我也问过同样的问题
<b>I once stood in your place.</b>

293
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,650
我那个时候也不怎么懂礼貌
<b>And I, too, was disrespectful.</b>

294
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,030
我能给你点建议吗
<b>So, might I offer you some advice?</b>

295
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,410
忘掉你自以为知道的
<b>Forget everything you think you know.</b>

296
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,420
好吧
<b>All right.</b>

297
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,010
这儿是我的师父的圣殿
<b>The sanctuary of our teacher.</b>

298
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,220
她叫古一
<b>The Ancient One.</b>

299
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,180
叫古一
<b>The Ancient One?</b>

300
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,380
是真名吗
<b>What's his real name?</b>

301
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,100
好吧
<b>Right.</b>

302
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,730
忘掉自以为知道的 抱歉
<b>Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.</b>

303
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,280
呃 谢谢 噢
<b>Urn, thank you for... Whoa!</b>

304
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,620
好吧 真是谢谢
<b>Okay, thats a thing.</b>

305
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,910
谢谢
<b>Thank you for...</b>

306
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,120
你好
<b>Hello.</b>

307
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,460
噢 谢谢
<b>Oh, thank you.</b>

308
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,420
非常感谢
<b>And thank you.</b>

309
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,550
呃 谢谢
<b>Uh, thank you...</b>

310
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,430
谢谢你接见我 古
<b>Ancient One, for seeing me.</b>

311
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,590
你不用那么客气
<b>You're very welcome.</b>

312
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,300
这位是古一
<b>The Ancient One.</b>

313
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,310
谢谢你 莫度法师 谢谢 哈密尔法师
<b>Thank you, Master Mordo. Thank you, Master Hamir.</b>

314
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,060
斯特兰奇先生
<b>Mr. Strange.</b>

315
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,310
呃 是医生 我是医生
<b>Uh... Doctor, actually.</b>

316
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,940
其实你已经不再是医生了
<b>Well, no, not anymore, surely.</b>

317
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,190
所以你来到这儿
<b>Isn't that why you're here?</b>

318
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,780
你最近做了很多手术
<b>You've undergone many procedures.</b>

319
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,110
七次 对吧
<b>Seven, right?</b>

320
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,200
是的
<b>Yeah.</b>

321
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,940
茶很不错
<b>it's good tea.</b>

322
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,280
是的
<b>Yes.</b>

323
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,290
你曾经治愈了一个叫潘博恩的人
<b>Did you heal a man named Pangborn?</b>

324
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,490
一个瘫痪的病人
<b>A paralyzed man?</b>

325
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,670
算是吧
<b>In a way.</b>

326
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,750
你帮助他能够走路了
<b>You helped him to walk again.</b>

327
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,960
是的
<b>Yes.</b>

328
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,670
你是怎么把完全损坏的颈7颈8两段脊髓给治好的
<b>How did you correct a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?</b>

329
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,630
不是我治的
<b>Well, I didn't correct it.</b>

330
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,600
他走不了路 我说服他可以走
<b>He couldn't walk. I convinced him that he could.</b>

331
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,680
你不会说那是心理治疗吧
<b>Youre not suggesting it was psychosomatic?</b>

332
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,730
当你重新连接受损的神经时
<b>When you reattach a severed nerve...</b>

333
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,270
是你在治疗 还是肢体在自愈
<b>is it you who heals it back together or the body?</b>

334
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,350
是细胞
<b>it's the cells.</b>

335
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,020
但是细胞只会通过
<b>The cells are only programmed...</b>

336
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,150
其本身独特的方式进行复原
<b>to put themselves back together in very specific ways.</b>

337
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,240
没错
<b>Right.</b>

338
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,820
如果我告诉你 你的身体可以
<b>What if I told you that your own body could be convinced...</b>

339
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,150
说服自己进行各种形式的复原呢
<b>to put itself back together in all sorts of ways?</b>

340
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,330
难道你是在说细胞再生吗
<b>Youre talking about cellular regeneration.</b>

341
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,660
这可是非常前沿的医疗技术
<b>Thats bleeding edge medical tech.</b>

342
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,670
所以你要这里研究
<b>Is that why youre working here?</b>

343
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,040
因为没有医学会的监管
<b>Without a governing medical board?</b>

344
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,090
我想问一下 这方法研究得怎么样了
<b>Just how experimental is your treatment?</b>

345
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,170
还行
<b>Quite.</b>

346
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,970
这么说 你找到了
<b>So, youve figured out a way...</b>

347
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,340
让神经细胞重新自我修复的方法
<b>to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?</b>

348
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,890
不 斯特兰奇先生
<b>No, Mr. Strange.</b>

349
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,390
但是我知道怎么借助灵魂
<b>I know how to reorient the spirit...</b>

350
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,180
更好地治愈身体
<b>to better heal the body.</b>

351
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,730
灵魂治愈身体
<b>The spirit to heal the body?</b>

352
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,690
没错
<b>That's right.</b>

353
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,810
不 好 好吧
<b>No. All right.</b>

354
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,980
那我们该怎么做
<b>How do we do that?</b>

355
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,660
从哪儿开始
<b>Where do we start?</b>

356
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,160
- 喜欢这张图吗 - 噢 不
<b>- Don't like that map? - Oh, no.</b>

357
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,410
很好 但是我之前只在
<b>it's really good. It's just, I've seen it before...</b>

358
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,790
礼品店见过这个
<b>in gift shops.</b>

359
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,920
那这个呢
<b>And what about this one?</b>

360
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,550
- 针灸 太棒了 - 是吗
<b>- Acupuncture, great. - Yeah?</b>

361
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,670
那么这个呢
<b>What about that one?</b>

362
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,550
给我看核磁共振图像 我不相信你这个
<b>Showing me an MRI scan. I do not believe this.</b>

363
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,230
这些图是手工画的
<b>Each of those maps was drawn up by someone...</b>

364
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,010
正如盲人摸象 只见其树木 未见森林
<b>who could see in part, but not the whole.</b>

365
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
我倾家荡产 买了这张单程票
<b>I spent my last dollar getting here, one- way ticket...</b>

366
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,820
您现在跟我说 得靠信仰来治愈
<b>and you're talking to me about healing through belief?</b>

367
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,400
你是个从洞中看世界的人
<b>You're a man looking at the world through a keyhole.</b>

368
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,940
你一生都在尝试
<b>You've spent your whole life</b>

369
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,360
把这个洞弄得更大点儿
<b>trying to widen that keyhole...</b>

370
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,070
从而见多识广
<b>to see more, to know more.</b>

371
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,240
可如今知道这个洞能再大点儿
<b>Now, on hearing that it can be widened...</b>

372
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,250
大到你无法想象时
<b>in ways you can't imagine...</b>

373
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,910
你却拒绝这种可能性
<b>you reject the possibility.</b>

374
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,500
我拒绝是因为我不相信 什么器官脉轮的神话故事
<b>No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales...</b>

375
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,250
也不相信什么精神力
<b>about chakras or energy...</b>

376
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,000
或者信仰的力量
<b>or the power of belief.</b>

377
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,170
根本就不存在什么灵魂
<b>There is no such thing as spirit!</b>

378
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,790
人类是物质的 仅此而已
<b>We are made of matter and nothing more.</b>

379
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,130
你也只是这宇宙中的一粒
<b>You're just another tiny, momentary speck</b>

380
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,550
微小而无关紧要的尘埃而已
<b>within an indifferent universe.</b>

381
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,260
你太小看你自己了
<b>You think too little of yourself.</b>

382
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,470
噢 你觉得你已经看透我了
<b>Oh, you think you see through me, do you?</b>

383
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,640
是这样吗
<b>Well, you don't.</b>

384
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,600
其实是 我已经看透你了
<b>But I see through you!</b>

385
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,700
你刚才对我做了什么
<b>What did you just do to me?</b>

386
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,960
我把你的灵魂推出了你的身体
<b>I pushed your astral form out of your physical form.</b>

387
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,660
茶里放了什么
<b>What's in that tea?</b>

388
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,460
裸头卓碱 迷幻药
<b>Psilocybin? LSD?</b>

389
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,250
就是茶
<b>It's just tea...</b>

390
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,380
加了点蜂蜜
<b>with a little honey.</b>

391
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,170
刚才怎么了
<b>What just happened?</b>

392
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,680
一瞬间 你进入了一个灵魂世界
<b>For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.</b>

393
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,760
什么
<b>The what?</b>

394
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,890
就是灵魂脱离了身体的所到之处
<b>A place where the soul exists apart from the body.</b>

395
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,890
你为什么要这样对我
<b>Why are you doing this to me?</b>

396
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,480
告诉你未知的东西太多了
<b>To show you just how much you don't know.</b>

397
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,610
睁开你的眼睛
<b>Open your eye.</b>

398
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,940
噢 该死
<b>Oh, shit!</b>

399
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,480
噢 天呐 噢 天呐  不
<b>Oh, God! Oh, God, no!</b>

400
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,030
不 不 不
<b>No, no, no!</b>

401
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,200
发生了什么
<b>What's happening?</b>

402
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,460
这不是真的 这不是真的
<b>This isnt real!</b>

403
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,010
再这样 他的身体会承受不住的
<b>His heart rate is getting dangerously high.</b>

404
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,350
我觉得他还好
<b>He looks all right to me.</b>

405
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,690
你自以为谙晓世事运行
<b>You think you know how the world works?</b>

406
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,070
你还以为物质宇宙就是一切
<b>You think that this material universe is all there is?</b>

407
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,870
什么是真
<b>What is real?</b>

408
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,580
在你所认知的背后 还藏着怎样的秘密
<b>What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses?</b>

409
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,080
在现实的源头
<b>At the root of existence...</b>

410
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,340
精神会与物质相连
<b>mind and matter meet.</b>

411
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,370
思想雕琢了现实
<b>Thou ghts shape reality.</b>

412
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,760
噢
<b>Oh!</b>

413
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,980
这个宇宙只是无限宇宙中的一个
<b>This universe is only one of an infinite number.</b>

414
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,730
世界是无限的
<b>Worlds without end.</b>

415
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,940
有的美好 生机勃勃
<b>Some benevolent and life giving.</b>

416
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,580
有的邪恶 充满了杀戮
<b>Others filled with malice and hunger.</b>

417
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,450
在那些黑暗的角落
<b>Dark places...</b>

418
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,420
蛮荒之力在贪婪地
<b>where powers older than time lie ravenous...</b>

419
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,340
伺机等待
<b>and waiting.</b>

420
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,620
你是谁
<b>Who are you</b>

421
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,700
在这多元宇宙中
<b>in this vast Multiverse,</b>

422
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,190
斯特兰奇先生
<b>Mr. Strange?</b>

423
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,370
你在礼品店里见过这些吗
<b>Have you seen that before in a gift shop?</b>

424
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,590
教我吧
<b>Teach me.</b>

425
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,340
不
<b>No.</b>

426
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,180
不
<b>No.</b>

427
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,260
不
<b>No!</b>

428
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,480
不 不 不
<b>No, no, no!</b>

429
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,740
不
<b>No!</b>

430
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,110
开开门 拜托
<b>Open the door! Please!</b>

431
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,660
有劳各位了
<b>Thank you, Masters.</b>

432
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,130
你觉得我不应该把他赶出去
<b>You think I was wrong to cast him out?</b>

433
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,580
已经五个小时了 他还在门口等着呢
<b>5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.</b>

434
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,380
他身上有一股劲儿
<b>There's a strength to him.</b>

435
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,170
倔强 傲慢 还有野心
<b>Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.</b>

436
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,920
似曾相识
<b>I've seen it all before.</b>

437
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,140
他让你想起了卡西利亚斯
<b>He reminds you of Kaecilius?</b>

438
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,060
我可不想再让一个有天赋的学生
<b>I cannot lead another gifted student to power...</b>

439
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,390
入门后被黑暗吞噬
<b>only to lose him to the darkness.</b>

440
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,850
但你没有失去我
<b>You didn't lose me.</b>

441
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,520
我渴望获得力量 去打败敌人
<b>I wanted the power to defeat my enemies.</b>

442
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,230
是你给了我力量 消灭心魔
<b>You gave me the power to defeat my demons.</b>

443
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,280
你让我学会遵循自然的法则
<b>And to live within the natural law.</b>

444
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,570
心魔不会被消灭 莫度
<b>We never lose our demons, Mordo.</b>

445
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,700
我们只学会了与他们共存
<b>We only learn to live above them.</b>

446
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,160
失窃的那几页还在卡西利亚斯手上
<b>Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.</b>

447
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,620
如果他破解了其中的奥义 他会把我们
<b>If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin...</b>

448
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,130
全部消灭
<b>upon us all.</b>

449
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,970
黑暗势力日益强大
<b>There may be dark days ahead.</b>

450
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,840
或许斯特兰奇能帮卡玛泰基渡过难关
<b>Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use a man like Strange.</b>

451
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,770
别把我关在外面
<b>Don't shut me out.</b>

452
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,650
我现在哪儿都去不了了
<b>I haven't got anywhere else to go.</b>

453
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,570
谢谢
<b>Thank you.</b>

454
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,950
泡个澡
<b>Bathe.</b>

455
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,290
休息一下
<b>Rest.</b>

456
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,620
有时间的话
<b>Meditate...</b>

457
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,630
冥想一会儿
<b>if you can.</b>

458
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,840
稍后古一会传唤你
<b>The Ancient One will send for you.</b>

459
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,110
香巴拉

460
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,930
这是什么 我的咒语吗
<b>Whats this? My mantra?</b>

461
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,270
这儿的无线密码
<b>The Wi-Fi password.</b>

462
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,480
我们又不是原始人
<b>Were not savages.</b>

463
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:17,180
时间会告诉你 我有多么爱你 克丽丝汀

464
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,520
克丽丝汀

465
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,970
这神秘法术的语言
<b>The language of the mystic arts..</b>

466
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,640
自诞生文明起就一直存在
<b>is as old as civilization.</b>

467
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,180
还在很久以前
<b>The sorcerers of antiquity...</b>

468
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,150
尊者们把这种语言称为咒语
<b>called the use of this language 'spells.'</b>

469
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,230
如果这名字让你觉得不太现实 那就
<b>But if that word offends your modern sensibilities...</b>

470
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,900
将其理解为程序
<b>you can call it a 'program.'</b>

471
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,070
搭建现实世界的源代码
<b>The source code that shapes reality.</b>

472
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,030
我们收集能量
<b>We harness energy...</b>

473
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,660
从多元宇宙的其它空间里获取
<b>drawn from other dimensions of the Multiverse...</b>

474
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,740
念出咒语
<b>to cast spells...</b>

475
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,960
铸造出盾牌
<b>to conjure shields...</b>

476
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,010
和利器
<b>and weapons...</b>

477
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,170
从而施展法术
<b>to make magic.</b>

478
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:22,060
但是 即便我的手指可以做到这些
<b>But even if my fingers could do that...</b>

479
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,820
我的手还只能在空中摇摆
<b>my hands would just be waving in the air.</b>

480
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,070
我的意思是 怎么从菜鸟到大师
<b>How do I get from here to there?</b>

481
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,700
那么你是如何修复好受损的神经
<b>How did you get to reattach severed nerves...</b>

482
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,370
如何将断裂的脊椎拼回原位的
<b>and put a human spine back together bone by bone?</b>

483
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,960
勤学加苦练 年复一年
<b>Study and practice, years of it.</b>

484
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,540
嗨
<b>Hey.</b>

485
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,600
斯特兰奇先生
<b>Mr. Strange.</b>

486
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,640
呃 请叫我史蒂芬
<b>Uh, Stephen, please.</b>

487
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,890
- 你是 - 王
<b>- And you are? - Wong.</b>

488
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,230
王
<b>Wang.</b>

489
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,140
是真名
<b>Just Wong?</b>

490
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,980
像阿黛尔
<b>Like Adele?</b>

491
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,560
或者亚里士多德
<b>Or Aristotle.</b>

492
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,320
德瑞克
<b>Drake.</b>

493
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,780
博诺
<b>Bono.</b>

494
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,240
埃米纳姆
<b>Eminem.</b>

495
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,490
这是视之书
<b>The Book of the Invisible Sun.</b>

496
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,910
这是宇宙新编
<b>Astronomia Nova.</b>

497
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,630
至尊法典
<b>Codex Imperium.</b>

498
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,630
所罗门之钥
<b>Key of Solomon.</b>

499
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,220
这些你都读完了
<b>You finished all of these?</b>

500
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,550
是的
<b>Yup.</b>

501
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,300
跟我来吧
<b>Come with me.</b>

502
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,510
好的
<b>All right.</b>

503
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,470
这个区域只对法师开放
<b>This section is for masters only...</b>

504
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,010
不过我同意的话 其他人也可以来看
<b>but at my discretion, others may use it.</b>

505
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,610
你可以从基础总论开始看
<b>You should start with Maxim's Primer.</b>

506
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,020
你梵文怎么样
<b>Hows your Sanskrit?</b>

507
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,110
反正有在线翻译
<b>I'm fluent in Google Translate.</b>

508
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,990
吠陀语 最古老的梵文
<b>Vedic, classical Sanskrit.</b>

509
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,990
那些是什么书
<b>What are those?</b>

510
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,750
那些是古一的私人收藏
<b>The Ancient Ones private collection.</b>

511
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,130
所以不能借阅
<b>So, theyre forbidden?</b>

512
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,800
在卡玛泰基 知识是可以共享的
<b>No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden.</b>

513
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,760
但有些并不能实践
<b>Only certain practices.</b>

514
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,590
这里除了至上尊者之外
<b>Those books are far too advanced</b>

515
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,760
其他人根本看不懂那些书
<b>for anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.</b>

516
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,820
这本书少了几页
<b>This ones got pages missing.</b>

517
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,270
这是卡里奥斯特罗之书
<b>Thats The Book of Cagliostro.</b>

518
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,110
是研究时间的
<b>A study of time.</b>

519
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,070
其中有几页被原来这儿的一个法师偷走了
<b>One of the rituals was stolen by a former master.</b>

520
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,870
狂热者 卡西利亚斯
<b>The Zealot, Kaecilius.</b>

521
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,910
他用绳子把前任图书管理员挂了起来
<b>Just after he strung up the former librarian...</b>

522
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,500
让他身首分家
<b>and relieved him of his head.</b>

523
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,040
我现在是这些书的守护者
<b>I am now the guardian of these books.</b>

524
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,840
但凡这些书有任何的缺页少皮什么的
<b>So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again...</b>

525
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,340
我都会知道
<b>I'd know it...</b>

526
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,720
我会让你还没出门 就身首分家
<b>and you'd be dead before you ever left the compound.</b>

527
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,520
要是过期未还呢 或者
<b>What if it's just overdue?</b>

528
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,850
我需要了解少一页 会缺胳膊少腿吗
<b>Any late fees I should know about? Maiming, perhaps?</b>

529
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,520
以前大家都觉得我还挺逗的
<b>People used to think that I was funny.</b>

530
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,910
你给他们开工资
<b>Did they work for you?</b>

531
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,200
真高兴和你聊天儿
<b>All right. Well, it's been lovely talking to you.</b>

532
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,120
感谢你介绍这些书
<b>Thank you for the books...</b>

533
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,420
和令人毛骨悚然的故事
<b>and for the horrifying story...</b>

534
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,330
以及对我的各种威胁
<b>and for the threat upon my life.</b>

535
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,410
我们现在接受那些
<b>We will now receive the power</b>

536
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,400
可以摧毁背叛我们
<b>to destroy the one who betrayed us.</b>

537
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,080
以及整个世界的能量
<b>The one who betrays the world.</b>

538
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,270
熟练使用悬戒在法术中十分重要
<b>Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts.</b>

539
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,930
它可以帮我们自由穿行于各个宇宙
<b>They allow us to travel throughout the Multiverse.</b>

540
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,480
你需要高度集中精力
<b>All you need to do is focus.</b>

541
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,530
使其形象化
<b>Visualize.</b>

542
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,940
脑海中浮现你的目的地
<b>See the destination in your mind.</b>

543
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,110
不要局限于眼前的世界
<b>Look beyond the world in front of you.</b>

544
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,120
要想象出每个细节
<b>Imagine every detail.</b>

545
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,380
脑海里的画面越清晰 传送之门
<b>The clearer the picture, the quicker and easier...</b>

546
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,840
就会出现得越快
<b>the gateway will come.</b>

547
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,590
先停一下
<b>And stop.</b>

548
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,290
我想跟斯特兰奇先生单独谈谈
<b>I would like a moment alone with Mr. Strange.</b>

549
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,090
请吧
<b>Of course.</b>

550
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,510
是因为我的手
<b>My hands.</b>

551
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,760
跟你的双手无关
<b>it's not about your hands.</b>

552
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,980
怎么可能跟我的双手无关
<b>How is this not about my hands?</b>

553
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,640
哈密尔法师
<b>Master Hamir.</b>

554
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,450
谢谢你 哈密尔法师
<b>Thank you, Master Hamir.</b>

555
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,580
抽刀断水水更流
<b>You cannot beat a river into submission.</b>

556
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,620
你得学会顺势借力
<b>You have to surrender to it's current...</b>

557
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,040
仿佛这力量源于你本身
<b>and use it's power as your own.</b>

558
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,380
顺势还怎么控制
<b>I control it by surrendering control?</b>

559
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,880
这根本就是行不通的
<b>That doesn't make any sense.</b>

560
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,420
世间万物自有其自身的道理
<b>Not everything does. Not everything has to.</b>

561
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,670
你靠自己的聪明才智获得了成功
<b>Your intellect has taken you far in life...</b>

562
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,310
但仅此而已
<b>but it will take you no further.</b>

563
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,800
觉悟吧 史蒂芬
<b>Surrender, Stephen.</b>

564
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,010
放弃你的自我
<b>Silence your ego...</b>

565
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,180
力量才会强大
<b>and your power will rise.</b>

566
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,230
跟我来
<b>Come with me.</b>

567
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,450
等等
<b>Wait.</b>

568
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,490
- 这是 - 珠穆朗玛峰
<b>- Is this... - Everest.</b>

569
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,120
非常美
<b>Beautiful.</b>

570
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,740
是 没错 很美
<b>Yeah, right, beautiful.</b>

571
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,330
真冷 但是很美
<b>Freezing but beautiful.</b>

572
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,580
在这种温度下
<b>At this temperature...</b>

573
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,000
人如果待上30分钟以上
<b>a person can last for 30 minutes...</b>

574
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,670
身体器官 包括性命 会发生危险
<b>before suffering permanent loss of function.</b>

575
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,920
好极了
<b>Great.</b>

576
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,470
你可能还扛不到两分钟就会晕倒
<b>But you'll likely go into shock within the first two.</b>

577
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,880
- 什么 - 屈服吧 史蒂芬
<b>- What? - Surrender, Stephen.</b>

578
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,090
不 不
<b>No!</b>

579
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,930
他表现怎么样
<b>How's our new recruit?</b>

580
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,230
几秒之内
<b>We shall see.</b>

581
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,740
即刻见分晓
<b>Any second now.</b>

582
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,120
还用这样吗
<b>Oh, no, not again.</b>

583
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,450
我是不是应该
<b>Maybe I should...</b>

584
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,690
史蒂芬
<b>Stephen.</b>

585
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:46,940
王
<b>Wang.</b>

586
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,990
你想要什么
<b>What do you want, Strange?</b>

587
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,490
我要关于灵魂出窍的书
<b>Books on astral projection.</b>

588
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,580
你还没有准备好
<b>You're not ready for that.</b>

589
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,990
试试看喽 碧昂斯
<b>Try me, Beyoncé.</b>

590
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,460
噢 天呐 你应该听过吧
<b>Oh, come on. You've heard of her.</b>

591
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,910
她可是个巨星
<b>She's a huge star, right?</b>

592
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,880
你毫无反应
<b>Do you ever laugh?</b>

593
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,750
噢 拜托 给我看看
<b>Oh, come on, just give me the book.</b>

594
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:08,890
不
<b>No.</b>

595
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,990
就在这间屋子里
<b>Once, in this room,</b>

596
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,420
你曾经求着我教你
<b>you begged me to let you learn.</b>

597
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,420
现在你告诉我 你质疑所有的课程
<b>Now, I'm told you question every lesson...</b>

598
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,090
选择自学
<b>preferring to teach yourself.</b>

599
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,090
在这间屋子里 你曾经让我开拓视野
<b>Once, in this room, you told me to open my eye.</b>

600
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,090
现在却让我盲目接受一些
<b>Now, I'm being told to blindly accept rules...</b>

601
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,590
完全没有道理的规矩
<b>that make no sense.</b>

602
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,720
是指不让你在图书馆随意使用悬戒的规矩吗
<b>Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?</b>

603
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,340
王打小报告了
<b>Wong told on me?</b>

604
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,020
法术方面 你确实学得很快
<b>You're advancing quickly with your sorcery skills.</b>

605
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,770
你现在需要个更安全的地方练习
<b>You need a safe space to practice your spells.</b>

606
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,240
这里是镜像空间
<b>You are now inside the Mirror Dimension...</b>

607
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,080
虽然存在 但无法察觉
<b>ever present but undetected.</b>

608
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,290
这儿发生什么都与现实世界无关
<b>The real world isn't affected by what happens here.</b>

609
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,430
我们在这镜像空间里训练 监视
<b>We use the Mirror Dimension to train, surveil...</b>

610
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,560
有时也用来隔离危险
<b>and sometimes to contain threats.</b>

611
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,730
如果没带悬戒 你会被困在这里
<b>You don't wanna be stuck in here without your sling ring.</b>

612
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,690
等等 不好意思 你指的危险是什么
<b>Hold on. Sorry. What do you mean, "threats?"</b>

613
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,450
想要了解无尽的多元宇宙 也要了解其无穷的危险
<b>Learning of an infinite Multiverse includes learning of infinite dangers.</b>

614
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,750
如果我现在告诉你 你不知道的一切
<b>If I told you everything else that you don't already know...</b>

615
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,370
你肯定会被吓跑的
<b>you'd run from here in terror.</b>

616
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,840
她到底有多大岁数了
<b>So just how ancient is she?</b>

617
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,540
还没有人能知道至上尊者的年龄
<b>No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme.</b>

618
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,510
只知道她是凯尔特人 从没提过她的过去
<b>Only that she's Celtic and never talks about her past.</b>

619
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,520
这么不知根知底 你还跟着她
<b>You follow her, even though you don't know?</b>

620
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,260
我知道她坚定不移 严格善良
<b>I know shes steadfast... but unpredictable.</b>

621
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,720
尽管深不可测
<b>Merciless, yet kind.</b>

622
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,360
她造就了我
<b>She made me what I am.</b>

623
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,360
相信你的师父
<b>Trust your teacher...</b>

624
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,230
别误入歧途
<b>and don't lose your way.</b>

625
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,520
就像卡西利亚斯
<b>Like Kaecilius?</b>

626
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:32,940
是的
<b>Thats right.</b>

627
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,910
你认识他
<b>You knew him.</b>

628
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,160
他刚来这里的时候
<b>When he first came to us...</b>

629
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,540
已经一无所有 生无所恋
<b>he'd lost everyone he ever loved.</b>

630
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,540
他伤心欲绝 渴望从神秘的法术中寻找答案
<b>He was a grieving, broken man searching for answers in the mystic arts.</b>

631
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,550
他天资聪颖 他骄傲固执
<b>A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong.</b>

632
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,590
他质疑古一 他甚至拒绝古一对他的教导
<b>He questioned the Ancient One, rejected her teaching.</b>

633
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,150
他离开了卡玛泰基
<b>He left Kamar-Taj.</b>

634
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,770
他的追随者像绵羊一样跟着他走了
<b>His disciples followed him like sheep.</b>

635
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,820
他们被虚假教义所蛊惑
<b>Seduced by false doctrine.</b>

636
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,320
就是他偷的那些书页 是不是
<b>And he stole the forbidden ritual, right?</b>

637
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,400
是的
<b>Yes.</b>

638
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,730
那几页是什么
<b>What did it do?</b>

639
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,410
你就别再问了
<b>No more questions.</b>

640
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,990
什么意思
<b>What's that?</b>

641
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,320
这也算问
<b>That's a question.</b>

642
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,920
这是法器
<b>This is a relic.</b>

643
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,920
有些魔法太难驾驭
<b>Some magic is too powerful to sustain...</b>

644
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,080
所以我们将其注入于物体
<b>so we imbue objects with it...</b>

645
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,550
这样才能随时让我们运用自如
<b>allowing them to take the strain we cannot.</b>

646
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,590
这是 我们使用的
<b>This is the staff...</b>

647
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,390
生命法庭权杖
<b>of the Living Tribunal.</b>

648
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,300
法器各不相同
<b>There are many relics.</b>

649
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,260
瓦图魔杖
<b>The Wand of Watoomb.</b>

650
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,890
这个 瓦尔托的跳跃靴子
<b>The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.</b>

651
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,890
这名字还不是一般的拗口
<b>Really just roll off the tongue, don't they?</b>

652
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,600
- 我什么时候可以有法器 - 你准备好的时候
<b>- When do I get my relic? - When you're ready.</b>

653
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,110
噢 我准备好了
<b>I think I'm ready.</b>

654
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,950
那得由法器决定你是否准备好了才行
<b>You're ready when the relic decides you're ready.</b>

655
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,860
现在
<b>For now...</b>

656
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:57,860
用法术当武器
<b>conjure a weapon.</b>

657
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,610
好吧
<b>All right.</b>

658
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,130
战斗
<b>Fight!</b>

659
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,750
生命危在旦夕 战斗
<b>Fight like your life depended on it.</b>

660
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,340
终有一日
<b>Because one day...</b>

661
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,850
必将如此
<b>it may.</b>

662
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,000
克丽丝汀

663
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:50,680
我再次给你写信

664
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,200
王
<b>Wong?</b>

665
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:44,880
好吧
<b>Okay.</b>

666
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,100
首先 打开阿戈摩托之眼
<b>'First, open the Eye of Agamotto."</b>

667
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,500
挺好
<b>All right.</b>

668
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,150
噢 天呐
<b>Oh, my.</b>

669
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:50,790
要是我
<b>What if...</b>

670
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,060
多玛姆
<b>'Dormammu.'</b>

671
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:16,980
黑暗空间
<b>'The Dark Dimension.'</b>

672
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,400
永恒的生命
<b>Eternal life?</b>

673
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,700
- 什么 - 住手
<b>- What the... - Stop!</b>

674
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,160
你怎么能这样随便打乱时空界限
<b>Tampering with continuum probabilities is forbidden.</b>

675
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,790
我 我刚才只是按照书里说的做的
<b>I was just doing exactly what it said in the book.</b>

676
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,200
书里说了什么
<b>What did the book say</b>

677
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,660
那有没有提到这样做的危险
<b>about the dangers of performing that ritual?</b>

678
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,460
我不清楚 我还没有看到那部分
<b>I don't know. I hadn't gotten to that part yet.</b>

679
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,540
要知道时间操控术可以创造时空分支
<b>Temporal manipulations can create branches in time.</b>

680
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,960
那是个极不稳定的空间
<b>Unstable dimensional openings.</b>

681
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,350
空间悖论 时间循环
<b>Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!</b>

682
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,470
你想被困在无限反复的时间里
<b>You wanna get stuck reliving the same moment</b>

683
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:51,850
永世不得脱身
<b>over and over forever...</b>

684
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,270
或者从来没有出现过吗
<b>or never having existed at all?</b>

685
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,930
警告是不是应该印在咒语前面才对
<b>Really should put the warnings before the spell.</b>

686
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,980
你的好奇心会让人丧命
<b>Your curiosity could have gotten you killed.</b>

687
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,390
你刚才那样做并不能操控时空
<b>You weren't manipulating the space-time continuum...</b>

688
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,480
而是在破坏它
<b>you were breaking it.</b>

689
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,860
我们不能扰乱自然法则
<b>We do not tamper with natural law.</b>

690
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:06,940
要捍卫它
<b>We defend it.</b>

691
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,490
你刚才是怎么做到的
<b>How did you even do that?</b>

692
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:09,860
嗯
<b>Hmm?</b>

693
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,030
你从哪儿学的这么冗长的咒语
<b>Where did you learn the litany of spells required to</b>

694
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,030
还居然能明白
<b>even understand it?</b>

695
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,280
我可有过目不忘的能力
<b>I've got a photographic memory.</b>

696
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,160
不然怎么能获得医学和物理学博士
<b>That's how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.</b>

697
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,870
但是你刚才那
<b>What you just did...</b>

698
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,290
光靠记忆力可做不到
<b>takes more than a good memory.</b>

699
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,300
你天生就是神秘法师
<b>You were born for the mystic arts.</b>

700
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,550
但是我的手还是不听使唤
<b>And yet my hands still shake.</b>

701
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,920
只是暂时的
<b>For now, yes.</b>

702
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,220
不是永久性的
<b>Not forever?</b>

703
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,510
我们不是预言家
<b>Were not prophets.</b>

704
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,390
你打算什么时候告诉我真相
<b>When are you gonna start telling me what we are?</b>

705
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:37,480
像复仇者那样的英雄们
<b>While heroes like the Avengers</b>

706
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,850
保卫世界不受自然侵害
<b>protect the world from physical dangers...</b>

707
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,400
像我们一样的法师们 保护世界不受魔法侵袭
<b>we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.</b>

708
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:46,950
至上尊者的名号代代传承
<b>The Ancient One is the latest in a long line</b>

709
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,190
古一是现任
<b>of Sorcerers Supreme...</b>

710
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,080
上千年前的神秘法师祖就是强大的
<b>going back thousands of years to the father of the mystic arts...</b>

711
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,360
阿戈摩托
<b>the mighty Agamotto.</b>

712
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,500
他创造了阿戈摩托之眼 就是你刚才打开的那个
<b>Same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed.</b>

713
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,500
阿戈摩托在现代城市中创造了三个
<b>Agamotto built three Sanctums in places of power...</b>

714
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,670
强大的圣殿
<b>where great cities now stand.</b>

715
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,920
这扇门通往香港圣殿
<b>That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum.</b>

716
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,550
那扇通往纽约圣殿
<b>That door to the New York Sanctum.</b>

717
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,470
那个 通往伦敦圣殿
<b>That one to the London Sanctum.</b>

718
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,640
就这样
<b>Together...</b>

719
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,350
三个圣殿构成了我们当今世界的保护网
<b>the Sanctums generate a protective shield around our world.</b>

720
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:20,510
圣殿保护世界
<b>The Sanctums protect the world...</b>

721
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,940
而法师
<b>and we sorcerers...</b>

722
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,850
则保护圣殿
<b>protect the Sanctums.</b>

723
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,980
谁会来捣乱吗
<b>From what?</b>

724
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,770
这说不准 比如说其它空间的生物
<b>Other dimensional beings that threaten our universe.</b>

725
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,610
比如多玛姆
<b>Like Dormammu.</b>

726
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,490
你怎么知道的这个名字
<b>Where did you learn that name?</b>

727
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,370
我从卡里奥斯特罗之书里 怎么了
<b>Ijust read itin The Book of Cagliostro. Why?</b>

728
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:45,130
多玛姆活在黑暗空间里
<b>Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension.</b>

729
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,290
超越了时间
<b>Beyond time.</b>

730
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,130
他是宇宙的吞噬者
<b>He is the cosmic conqueror...</b>

731
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,130
世界的毁灭者
<b>the destroyer of worlds.</b>

732
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,970
具有无穷的能量和超大的野心
<b>A being of infinite power and endless hunger...</b>

733
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,470
他想要入侵所有宇宙
<b>on a quest to invade every universe...</b>

734
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,270
将所有世界全都带入黑暗空间
<b>and bring all worlds into his Dark Dimension.</b>

735
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,150
他最想占领的就是地球
<b>And he hungers for Earth most of all.</b>

736
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,490
那卡西利亚斯偷走的那几页
<b>The pages that Kaecilius stole.</b>

737
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,070
是召唤多玛姆 以及
<b>A ritual to contact Dormammu</b>

738
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,650
从黑暗世界汲取力量的仪式
<b>and draw power from the Dark Dimension.</b>

739
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,700
呃 好吧 好吧
<b>Uh... Okay...</b>

740
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,290
呃 我 我放弃
<b>Urn... I'rn out.</b>

741
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:24,660
我来这儿可是治疗双手的
<b>I carne here to heal rny hands.</b>

742
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,710
我可不想参加什么神秘的战争
<b>Not to fight in some mystical war.</b>

743
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,010
伦敦
<b>London.</b>

744
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:37,840
卡西利亚斯
<b>Kaecilius!</b>

745
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,130
不
<b>No!</b>

746
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,230
王 莫度
<b>Wong? Mordo?</b>

747
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,450
布雷克大街177A号

748
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,240
有人吗
<b>Hello?</b>

749
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:09,600
有人吗
<b>Hello?</b>

750
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,940
丹尼尔 他们把你封为这个圣殿的法师
<b>Daniel, I see they made you master of this Sanctum.</b>

751
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,150
那你应该明白
<b>You know what that means?</b>

752
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,320
你将为保卫它而死
<b>That you'll die protecting it.</b>

753
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,550
住手
<b>Stop!</b>

754
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,230
你在卡玛泰基多久了 尊敬的
<b>How long have you been at Kamar-Taj, Mister...</b>

755
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,640
医生
<b>Doctor.</b>

756
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,100
你叫医生
<b>Mister Doctor?</b>

757
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,190
我叫斯特兰奇
<b>It's Strange.</b>

758
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,190
是挺奇的 管你叫什么
<b>Maybe. Who am Ito judge?</b>

759
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,300
你不知道怎么用吧
<b>You don't know how to use that, do you?</b>

760
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:51,910
什么
<b>What?</b>

761
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,290
噢 别念了
<b>Oh, stop it.</b>

762
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,410
我叫你停下
<b>I said stop it.</b>

763
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:00,960
这停不下来的 医生先生
<b>You cannot stop this, Mister Doctor.</b>

764
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,590
什么 我都不知道这是什么
<b>I don't even know what 'this' is.</b>

765
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,790
这是结束
<b>It's the end...</b>

766
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:06,790
也是开始
<b>and the beginning.</b>

767
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,710
结果由多变少 由少归一
<b>The many becoming the few becoming the One.</b>

768
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:12,890
你要是再跟我这么文绉绉的
<b>If youre not gonna start making sense...</b>

769
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,640
我就还用这个把你嘴封上
<b>I'm just gonna to have to put this thing back on.</b>

770
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:15,840
说吧 医生先生
<b>Tell me, Mister Doctor...</b>

771
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,310
听着 我的名字叫史蒂芬·斯特兰奇医生
<b>My name is Doctor Stephen Strange.</b>

772
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,140
- 你真是医生 - 是的
<b>- You are a doctor? - Yeah.</b>

773
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,310
作为科学家
<b>A scientist.</b>

774
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,470
你深谙大自然的法则
<b>You understand the laws of nature.</b>

775
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,940
万事万物 生死有命
<b>All things age. All things die.</b>

776
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:29,570
时光终焉 金乌殆尽
<b>In the end, our sun burns out.</b>

777
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,900
温度逐降 地球灭亡
<b>Our universe grows cold and perishes.</b>

778
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,780
但在黑暗空间
<b>But the Dark Dimension...</b>

779
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,620
这根本不受时间限制
<b>it's a place beyond time.</b>

780
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,360
我看还是得把你嘴封起来
<b>Thats it. I'm putting this thing back on.</b>

781
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,870
这个世界无须灭亡
<b>This world doesn't have to die, doctor.</b>

782
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,710
它可以像许多其它世界一样
<b>This world can take its rightful place alongside so many others...</b>

783
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,120
成为多玛姆的一部分
<b>as part of the One.</b>

784
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,670
非常美丽的部分
<b>The great and beautiful One.</b>

785
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:49,170
我们将拥抱生命
<b>We can all live forever.</b>

786
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,670
真的吗
<b>Really?</b>

787
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:55,930
那你从这个新世界空间的乌托邦中能获得什么
<b>What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia?</b>

788
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,010
和你一样
<b>The same as you.</b>

789
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:01,010
和每个人都一样的生命 永恒的生命
<b>The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life.</b>

790
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,520
人们思索着善良与邪恶
<b>People think in terms of good and evil...</b>

791
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,520
而真正的敌人就是时间
<b>when really time is the true enemy of us all.</b>

792
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:07,320
时间消灭一切
<b>Time kills everything.</b>

793
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:09,150
那你消灭了的那些人的生命呢
<b>What about the people you killed?</b>

794
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,530
微不足道
<b>Tiny.</b>

795
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,070
那只是浩瀚宇宙中的微小尘埃
<b>Momentary specks within an indifferent universe.</b>

796
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,070
是啊 你看看
<b>Yes. You see.</b>

797
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,910
看看这世界
<b>You see what we're doing.</b>

798
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,280
这个世界还没有回归到正规
<b>The world is not what it ought to be.</b>

799
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,870
每一个人都渴望永生
<b>Humanity longs for the eternal...</b>

800
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,670
想要超越时间 因为我们只是时间的奴隶
<b>for a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us.</b>

801
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,000
时间是对人类的侮辱
<b>Time is an insult.</b>

802
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,710
死亡是最大的耻辱
<b>Death is an insult.</b>

803
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,380
医生
<b>Doctor...</b>

804
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:37,850
我并非想统治世界
<b>we don't seek to rule this world.</b>

805
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:39,170
而是想拯救世界
<b>We seek to save it...</b>

806
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:40,800
交由万物之主多玛姆来处理这一切
<b>to hand it over to Dormammu,</b>

807
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,760
他才是万物之主
<b>who is the intent of all evolution...</b>

808
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,600
他是万物之源
<b>the why of all existence.</b>

809
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:49,520
应该是至上尊者保卫这世界
<b>The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.</b>

810
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,320
你为什么来卡玛泰基 是想开拓思维
<b>What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj, doctor?</b>

811
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,820
还是想获得
<b>Was it enlightenment?</b>

812
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:56,820
力量
<b>Power?</b>

813
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,080
你是想来疗伤的 正和大家一样
<b>You came to be healed, as did we all.</b>

814
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,410
卡玛泰基收容可怜的人们
<b>Kamar-Taj is a place that collects broken things.</b>

815
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,490
我们带着治疗的心态而来
<b>We all come with the promise of being healed...</b>

816
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:10,420
而古一却在玩一些小把戏
<b>and instead The Ancient One gives us parlor tricks.</b>

817
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,260
只有她自己修炼真正的法术
<b>The real magic she keeps for herself.</b>

818
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,680
你不好奇她是怎么活这么长时间的吗
<b>You ever wonder how she managed to live this long?</b>

819
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:25,270
我 看到了卡里奥斯特罗之书中的仪式
<b>I saw the rituals in The Book of Cagliostro.</b>

820
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:27,770
那你应该知道
<b>So, you know.</b>

821
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:29,690
仪式能够给我强大的力量
<b>The ritual gives me the power</b>

822
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,110
战胜古一
<b>to overthrow The Ancient One...</b>

823
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,940
毁灭她的圣殿
<b>and tear her Sanctums down.</b>

824
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:35,690
释放黑暗空间
<b>To let the Dark Dimension in.</b>

825
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,780
因为多玛姆会大方地赐予永恒的生命
<b>Because what The Ancient One hoards,</b>

826
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,490
而古一
<b>Dormammu gives freely.</b>

827
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,820
是不愿教我的
<b>Life everlasting.</b>

828
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,960
多玛姆不是世界的毁灭者
<b>He's not the destroyer of worlds, doctor.</b>

829
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,950
而是拯救者
<b>He's the savior of worlds.</b>

830
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,240
不 算了吧
<b>No. I mean, come on.</b>

831
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,170
你看看你自己吧
<b>Look at your face.</b>

832
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,720
多玛姆把你变成了杀手
<b>Dormammu made you a murderer.</b>

833
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,010
可想而知 在他的地盘
<b>Just how good can his kingdom be?</b>

834
01:04:57,970 --> 01:04:59,510
你觉得这很好笑
<b>You think thats funny?</b>

835
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,640
不不不 并不是
<b>No, not that.</b>

836
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:04,220
我笑的是 你的悬戒不见了
<b>What's funny is that you've lost your sling ring.</b>

837
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:13,670
先生 我能帮你吗
<b>Sir, can I help you?</b>

838
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,960
帕尔默医生 她在哪儿
<b>Doctor Palmer, where is she?</b>

839
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:16,620
- 先生 我必须 - 她在哪儿
<b>- Sir. We need to get... - Where is she?</b>

840
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,210
她 她在护士站
<b>The nurses station.</b>

841
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,380
克丽丝汀
<b>Christine!</b>

842
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:22,550
史蒂芬
<b>Stephen?</b>

843
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,720
噢 天呐
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

844
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:26,390
马上把我送到手术室去 别叫其他人
<b>Get me in an operating theater now. Just you.</b>

845
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,590
快 我没时间了
<b>Now I haven't any time.</b>

846
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,310
发生什么了
<b>What happened?</b>

847
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,360
我被刺伤了 我 心脏填塞
<b>I was stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.</b>

848
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,890
你这穿的是什么东西
<b>What are you wearing?</b>

849
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,530
你的胸腔正常
<b>Chest cavity is clear.</b>

850
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:45,360
血液流到心包囊里了
<b>No, the blood is in the pericardial sac.</b>

851
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,490
不 不 不 不 不 不
<b>No, no, no.</b>

852
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,570
史蒂芬
<b>Stephen?</b>

853
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:53,380
挺住 挺住
<b>Come on, come on.</b>

854
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,470
心率过低

855
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:21,320
往上一点儿
<b>Just a little higher.</b>

856
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,780
别紧张 小心针头
<b>Please be careful with the needle.</b>

857
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:26,860
史蒂芬
<b>Stephen?</b>

858
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:30,610
我看到什么了
<b>What am I seeing?</b>

859
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,660
这是我的灵魂
<b>My astral body.</b>

860
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:34,950
你死了吗
<b>Are you dead?</b>

861
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,840
还没有 但是我快死了
<b>No, Christine. But I am dying.</b>

862
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:40,920
好吧 好吧
<b>Right.</b>

863
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:43,380
好吧 往上点儿
<b>Yeah. All right.</b>

864
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,130
好吧
<b>Okay.</b>

865
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,390
噢 喔
<b>Oh, wow.</b>

866
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,860
我从没见过这样的伤口
<b>I've never seen a wound like this.</b>

867
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,810
你是被什么刺伤的
<b>What were you stabbed with?</b>

868
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,570
我也不知道
<b>I don't know.</b>

869
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,090
我现在得消失一会儿
<b>I'm gonna have to vanish now.</b>

870
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,550
你说什么
<b>What?</b>

871
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,170
拜托 别让我死
<b>Keep me alive, will you?</b>

872
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,300
好吧 好吧
<b>Okay.</b>

873
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,830
天呐
<b>Oh, shit.</b>

874
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,370
充电至200焦耳

875
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,660
加油 加油
<b>Come on, come on.</b>

876
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:40,830
史蒂芬 挺住
<b>Stephen, come on.</b>

877
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,960
再来一次
<b>Hit me again.</b>

878
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,630
别这么吓我
<b>Stop doing that!</b>

879
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,590
增大电压 再来一次
<b>Up the voltage and hit me again.</b>

880
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:49,720
你已经有心跳了
<b>No, your hearts beating!</b>

881
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:51,130
听我的
<b>Just do it!</b>

882
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:53,630
但是我
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

883
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,110
充电至360焦耳

884
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,240
请勿触碰病人 按下电击按钮

885
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,710
天呐 我的天呐
<b>Oh, God! Oh, God!</b>

886
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:25,960
你还好吧
<b>Are you okay?</b>

887
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:27,130
还好
<b>Yeah.</b>

888
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:28,300
好的 好的
<b>Okay.</b>

889
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:36,800
没想到过了这么久
<b>After all this time...</b>

890
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,760
你突然就这么出现
<b>you just show up here...</b>

891
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,400
从身体里飞了出来
<b>flying out of your body.</b>

892
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:44,270
我知道
<b>Yeah, I know.</b>

893
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,980
其实我也很想你
<b>I missed you, too, by the way.</b>

894
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:50,650
我给你写了邮件 但你从来没回我
<b>I wrote you emails, but you never responded.</b>

895
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:51,980
我为什么要回
<b>Why would I?</b>

896
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:55,200
克丽丝汀 我真的真的很抱歉
<b>Christine, I am so, so sorry.</b>

897
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:58,120
我想说你说得对
<b>For all of it. You were right.</b>

898
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:01,920
我就是混蛋 我对你很不好 伤透了你的心
<b>I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly.</b>

899
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,420
你值得遇到更好的人
<b>And you deserved so much more.</b>

900
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,040
你真的是把我吓坏了
<b>Stop. Youre clearly in shock.</b>

901
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:10,300
我想知道到底发生了什么
<b>What the hell is happening?</b>

902
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:11,760
你去了哪儿
<b>Where have you been?</b>

903
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,840
发现西医没什么指望以后
<b>Well, after Western medicine failed me...</b>

904
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:18,890
我就一路向东 最后到加德满都
<b>I headed east, and I ended up in Kathmandu.</b>

905
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:20,140
加德满都
<b>Kathmandu?</b>

906
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:21,510
是啊
<b>Yeah.</b>

907
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,680
是鲍勃·塞格尔那首歌吗
<b>Like the Bob Seger song?</b>

908
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,770
那首歌在1975年美丽失败者专辑的A面
<b>1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. Yeah.</b>

909
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:29,650
我去了一个叫做卡玛泰基的地方
<b>I went to a place called Kamar-Taj...</b>

910
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,490
遇到了一个叫古一的人
<b>and I talked to someone called The Ancient One.'</b>

911
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,610
噢 你真走火入魔了
<b>Oh. So you joined a cult.</b>

912
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,290
不 没有 也不能说没有
<b>No, I didn't. No, not exactly. No.</b>

913
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,210
他们确实教会了我借用未知的力量
<b>They did teach me to tap into powers that I never even knew existed.</b>

914
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:42,620
没错 你一定走火入魔了
<b>Yeah. That sounds like a cult.</b>

915
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,040
真的不是走火入魔
<b>It's not a cult.</b>

916
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,540
嗯 只有走火入魔的人才会这么说
<b>Well, that's what a cultist would say.</b>

917
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,790
噢 不
<b>Oh, no.</b>

918
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,840
等等 史蒂芬 你到底想上哪儿去
<b>Wait. Stephen, wait. What do you think youre doing?</b>

919
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:51,710
神魔大会不能迟到
<b>I'm late for a cult meeting.</b>

920
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,600
你不会疯了吧
<b>This is insane.</b>

921
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,760
是啊
<b>Yeah.</b>

922
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,840
- 你到底想去哪儿 - 呃
<b>- Where are you going? - Urn...</b>

923
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,800
不能说实话吗
<b>Can you tell me the truth?</b>

924
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,470
哇哦 一个诡异上古实体
<b>Well, a powerful sorcerer</b>

925
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,270
并且强大得能改变自然法则的法师
<b>who gave himself over to an ancient entity...</b>

926
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,980
正不惜一切手段要杀我
<b>can bend the very laws of physics, tried very hard to kill me.</b>

927
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:10,860
而我把他困在格林威治村了
<b>But I left him chained up in Greenwich Village...</b>

928
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:13,310
回去的最好办法就是通过我在清洁间里
<b>and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway...</b>

929
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:14,610
设置的时空传送门
<b>that I opened up in the mop closet.</b>

930
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,570
好吧 别跟我说了 没关系
<b>Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.</b>

931
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:28,710
我必须得走了
<b>Really do have to go.</b>

932
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,750
斯特兰奇
<b>Strange!</b>

933
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:21,510
你没事
<b>You're okay.</b>

934
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:23,850
相对而言的话 我还好
<b>A relative term. But yeah, I'm okay.</b>

935
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,390
那件魔浮斗篷
<b>The Cloak of Levitation.</b>

936
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,900
它喜欢你
<b>It came to you.</b>

937
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:31,100
魔浮斗篷可是
<b>No minor feat.</b>

938
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:33,480
很难得呀
<b>it's a fickle thing.</b>

939
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,650
- 他逃跑了 - 卡西利亚斯
<b>- Hes escaped. - Kaecilius?</b>

940
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:36,940
是啊
<b>Yeah.</b>

941
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,740
他能够随意折叠空间和物质
<b>He can fold space and matter at will.</b>

942
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:43,360
你是说他在镜面空间之外折叠物质
<b>He folds matter outside the Mirror Dimension...</b>

943
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:44,620
在现实世界
<b>in the real world?</b>

944
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:45,820
是的
<b>Yeah.</b>

945
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,790
- 他有多少人 - 两个
<b>- How many more? - Two.</b>

946
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:50,880
我把其中一个困在沙漠里了
<b>I stranded one in the desert.</b>

947
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,040
另一个呢
<b>And the other?</b>

948
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,590
尸体还在大厅
<b>His body's in the hail.</b>

949
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:55,460
德拉姆法师还在那儿
<b>Master Drumm is in the foyer.</b>

950
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,330
他已经被带回卡玛泰基了
<b>He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.</b>

951
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:58,840
伦敦圣殿已经崩塌
<b>The London Sanctum has fallen.</b>

952
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,340
只有纽约圣殿和香港圣殿能保护我们
<b>Only New York and Hong Kong remain now...</b>

953
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,590
不受黑暗空间的侵害
<b>to shield us from the Dark Dimension.</b>

954
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:07,230
你马上去守住纽约圣殿
<b>You defended the New York Sanctum from attack.</b>

955
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,220
那里需要新的法师
<b>With its master gone, it needs another.</b>

956
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,890
斯特兰奇法师
<b>Master Strange.</b>

957
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,770
不
<b>No.</b>

958
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:17,980
我是斯特兰奇博士
<b>It is Doctor Strange.</b>

959
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:20,780
不是法师 不是先生
<b>Not Master Strange. Not Mister Strange.</b>

960
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,030
我是斯特兰奇博士
<b>Doctor Strange.</b>

961
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:26,910
我杀了一个人 我当医生的时候 我发过誓
<b>When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm.</b>

962
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,330
尽量不让人受到伤害
<b>And I have just killed a man!</b>

963
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,250
可我刚刚就杀了一个人
<b>I'm not doing that again.</b>

964
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,790
我当医生是为了救人 不是为了杀人
<b>I became a doctor to save lives, not take them.</b>

965
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:36,210
你当医生不过是为了救一个人的性命
<b>You became a doctor to save one life above all others.</b>

966
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,290
你自己的
<b>Your own.</b>

967
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:40,550
你这是看透我了 是吗
<b>Still seeing through me, are you?</b>

968
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,740
我所见的是事实
<b>I see what I've always seen:</b>

969
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,380
你内心狂妄自大
<b>your over-inflated ego.</b>

970
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:48,100
你想回到你的妄想之中 掌控一切
<b>You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything...</b>

971
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:49,600
甚至死亡
<b>even death...</b>

972
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:51,400
没人能掌控死亡
<b>which no one can control.</b>

973
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:54,230
即使伟大的斯特兰奇医生也不行
<b>Not even the great Doctor Stephen Strange.</b>

974
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,570
多玛姆也不行吗
<b>Not even Dormammu?</b>

975
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,070
他可以让人永生
<b>He offers immortality.</b>

976
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,230
人类越害怕死亡 多玛姆就越有生命力
<b>it's our fear of death that gives Dormammu life.</b>

977
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,620
他靠这个活着
<b>He feeds off it.</b>

978
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,040
相当于我们养着他
<b>Like you feed off him?</b>

979
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,950
你还骗我说掌控死亡
<b>You talk to me about controlling death?</b>

980
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,120
我知道你是怎么做到的
<b>Oh, I know how you do it.</b>

981
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:12,000
我已经看到了卡里奥斯特罗缺失页中的仪式
<b>I've seen the missing rituals from The Book of Cagliostro.</b>

982
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,910
我提醒你注意接下来的措辞 医生
<b>Measure your next words very carefully, doctor.</b>

983
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:17,880
因为你可能不喜欢听 是吗
<b>Because you might not like them?</b>

984
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,000
因为你可能不知道你到底在说些什么
<b>Because you may not know of what you speak.</b>

985
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,750
他在说些什么
<b>What is he talking about?</b>

986
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:26,220
我在说关于她的寿命 和她能够永生的秘密
<b>I'm talking about her long life, the source of her immortality.</b>

987
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:29,640
她从黑暗世界中获取能量
<b>She draws power from the Dark Dimension</b>

988
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,260
从而得到永生
<b>to stay alive.</b>

989
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,350
这不是真的
<b>Thats not true.</b>

990
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:36,720
我看到了仪式 已经明白了
<b>I've seen the rituals. Worked them out.</b>

991
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:39,020
我知道你怎么做到的
<b>I know how you do it.</b>

992
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,150
狂热者汇合
<b>Once they regroup...</b>

993
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:43,900
他们就会卷土重来
<b>the Zealots will be back.</b>

994
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,450
你需要一些人手
<b>You'll need reinforcements.</b>

995
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,410
她不是你么看到的那样
<b>She's not who you think she is.</b>

996
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:57,460
你没有权利这么说
<b>You don't have the right to say that.</b>

997
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,300
你根本都不知道她肩上的担子有多重
<b>You've no idea the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.</b>

998
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:02,300
对 我也根本不想知道
<b>No, and I don't want to know.</b>

999
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,760
你是个懦夫
<b>You're a coward.</b>

1000
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,170
就因为我不是杀手
<b>Because I'm not a killer?</b>

1001
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:06,920
狂热者会杀光我们所有人
<b>These Zealots will snuff us all out...</b>

1002
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,600
你就眼睁睁地看着 就不能先下手为强吗
<b>and you can't muster the strength to snuff them first?</b>

1003
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:11,100
我刚刚不就下手了吗
<b>What do you think I just did?</b>

1004
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:12,520
你在救你自己的命
<b>You saved your own life!</b>

1005
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:16,440
你的行为就像一条狗一样哀嚎
<b>And then whined about it like a wounded dog.</b>

1006
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:17,890
难道你们就可以问心无愧
<b>Oh, you would have done it so easily?</b>

1007
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,810
你根本不知道我经历了些什么
<b>You've no idea the things I've done.</b>

1008
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:24,860
你说得没错
<b>And the answer is yes.</b>

1009
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:26,660
是他们会杀人不眨眼
<b>Without hesitation.</b>

1010
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:27,990
就没有其他的办法了吗
<b>Even if theres another way?</b>

1011
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,990
根本没有其他办法
<b>There is no other way.</b>

1012
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,450
我看是你缺乏想象
<b>You lack imagination.</b>

1013
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:32,620
不 史蒂芬
<b>No, Stephen.</b>

1014
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:36,330
是你 毫无勇气
<b>You lack a spine.</b>

1015
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:42,670
他们回来了
<b>They're back.</b>

1016
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:50,760
必须有个了断
<b>We have to end this.</b>

1017
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:52,060
上
<b>Now!</b>

1018
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,390
斯特兰奇
<b>Strange!</b>

1019
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:00,230
快点下来 战斗
<b>Get down here and fight!</b>

1020
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:01,650
不
<b>No!</b>

1021
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,360
镜像空间
<b>The Mirror Dimension.</b>

1022
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,360
在这里不会影响到现实世界
<b>You can't affect the real world in here.</b>

1023
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:12,160
看谁笑到最后
<b>Whos laughing now?</b>

1024
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:13,490
你个混蛋
<b>Asshole.</b>

1025
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,410
是我
<b>I am.</b>

1026
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,680
我拿到了他的悬戒
<b>I've got his sling ring.</b>

1027
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:32,760
他们就跑不了了吧
<b>They can't escape, right?</b>

1028
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:35,270
跑
<b>Run!</b>

1029
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,080
他们和黑暗空间的联系
<b>Their connection to the Dark Dimension</b>

1030
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,080
增强了他们在镜像空间中的能力
<b>makes them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension.</b>

1031
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:58,500
他们无法影响现实世界 但是他们仍然可以干掉我们
<b>They can't affect the real world, but they can still kill us.</b>

1032
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:01,420
这简直是送死
<b>This wasn't cleverness. It was suicide!</b>

1033
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,860
直觉之门

1034
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,230
这真是太可笑了
<b>That is hilarious.</b>

1035
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:08,190
这真是个错误
<b>This was a mistake.</b>

1036
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,620
噢
<b>Oh!</b>

1037
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,780
这是真的
<b>It's true.</b>

1038
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:46,080
她确实从黑暗空间中吸取了能量
<b>She does draw power from the Dark Dimension.</b>

1039
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:50,630
卡西利亚斯
<b>Kaecilius.</b>

1040
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:56,260
那时的我 绝望
<b>I came to you broken...</b>

1041
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,260
迷惘 无助
<b>lost, in need.</b>

1042
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,260
我信任你 尊你为师 而你却用谎言欺骗了我
<b>Trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.</b>

1043
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:04,230
我那时是要保护你
<b>I tried to protect you.</b>

1044
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,720
防止真相暴露
<b>From the truth?</b>

1045
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:06,720
防止伤害你
<b>From yourself.</b>

1046
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:09,100
我有一位新导师了
<b>I have a new teacher now.</b>

1047
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,600
多玛姆是在欺骗你
<b>Dormammu deceives you.</b>

1048
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:13,900
你并没有看到他的真实面目
<b>You have no idea what he truly is.</b>

1049
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:17,950
他那永恒的生命不是天堂 而是地狱
<b>His eternal life is not paradise, but torment.</b>

1050
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,320
骗子
<b>Liar.</b>

1051
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:16,170
克丽丝汀
<b>Christine!</b>

1052
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:18,590
这不是在开玩笑吧
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

1053
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:20,750
噢 天呐
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

1054
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,520
她这不是心率失常 而是心肌顿挫
<b>it's not fibrillation. She has a stunned myocardium.</b>

1055
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,720
- 是神经性的吗 - 没错
<b>- Neurogenic? - Yes.</b>

1056
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:31,990
谁去拿棉签
<b>Someone get the swabs.</b>

1057
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:36,520
尼克
<b>Nic?</b>

1058
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:41,530
我们得帮她进行颅内减压
<b>We need to relieve the pressure on her brain.</b>

1059
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:45,300
她的心率还在下降
<b>She's still dropping.</b>

1060
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,490
她就要死了
<b>Were losing her!</b>

1061
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,820
我们得马上给她供氧
<b>We need to increase her oxygen!</b>

1062
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,000
帮我准备担架车
<b>I need a crash cart!</b>

1063
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:51,070
她的瞳孔放大了
<b>Her pupils have dilated!</b>

1064
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:52,870
没有反应
<b>No reflexes.</b>

1065
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,330
已经读不到任何脑部活动了
<b>Were not reading any brain activity.</b>

1066
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,520
你在干嘛
<b>What are you doing?</b>

1067
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,220
拜托 你要死了
<b>Come on, youre dying!</b>

1068
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,400
你必须回到身体里 不然你就没时间了
<b>You have to return to your body now. You don't have time.</b>

1069
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:23,190
时间是相对的
<b>Time is relative.</b>

1070
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:25,570
你自己还没习惯法师的角色
<b>Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.</b>

1071
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,280
我已经花很多年时间
<b>I've spent so many years...</b>

1072
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:31,080
窥视未来
<b>peering through time...</b>

1073
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,740
看着这时间点
<b>looking at this exact moment.</b>

1074
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,450
我可能挺不过去了
<b>But I can't see past it.</b>

1075
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:39,670
我已经阻止了无数次可怕的事件
<b>I've prevented countless, terrible futures.</b>

1076
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,340
但是坏事永远接踵而来
<b>And after each one, there's always another.</b>

1077
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:44,800
所有人都会走到这步
<b>And they all lead here...</b>

1078
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:45,880
停滞不进
<b>but never further.</b>

1079
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,100
你觉得自己就这么死去了吗
<b>You think this is where you die.</b>

1080
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,390
你想知道你自己的未来吗
<b>You wonder what I see in your future?</b>

1081
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,600
不
<b>No.</b>

1082
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,980
想
<b>Yes.</b>

1083
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:57,600
我看不到你的未来
<b>I never saw your future.</b>

1084
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,240
只能看到可能性
<b>Only its possibilities.</b>

1085
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,030
你是一个生性善良的好人
<b>You have such a capacity for goodness.</b>

1086
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,110
你出类拔萃
<b>You always excelled...</b>

1087
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,690
并不是因为你渴望成功
<b>but not because you craved success...</b>

1088
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:10,250
而是你太害怕失败
<b>but because of your fear of failure.</b>

1089
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:12,070
我是一个成功的医生
<b>Thats what made me a great doctor.</b>

1090
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:14,870
这也是你不够伟大的原因
<b>it's precisely what kept you from greatness.</b>

1091
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,040
傲慢和害怕失败
<b>Arrogance and fear still keep you...</b>

1092
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:19,500
使你对最简单
<b>from learning the simplest</b>

1093
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:21,630
也最重要的事情一无所知
<b>and most significant lesson of all.</b>

1094
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:22,710
那是
<b>Which is?</b>

1095
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:27,180
生命的意义不在自我
<b>it's not about you.</b>

1096
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:32,260
当你第一次来找我时
<b>When you first came to me...</b>

1097
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:35,520
你问我是怎么治好乔纳森·潘博恩的
<b>you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pang born.</b>

1098
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:37,810
其实我没有
<b>I didn't.</b>

1099
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:43,980
我没有治愈他 是他自己为自己注入了空间的力量
<b>He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body.</b>

1100
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,900
难道他靠法术行走
<b>He uses magic to walk?</b>

1101
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:47,150
一直如此
<b>Constantly.</b>

1102
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,580
他曾经面临抉择
<b>He had a choice...</b>

1103
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,330
是回归自己的生活
<b>to return to his own life...</b>

1104
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,200
还是为更崇高的目标奉献自我
<b>or to serve something greater than himself.</b>

1105
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,960
那么我的手能重新治好
<b>So I could have my hands back again?</b>

1106
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,460
回到原来的生活
<b>My old life?</b>

1107
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,370
当然可以
<b>You could.</b>

1108
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:05,250
但是世界终究会有所遗憾
<b>And the world would be all the lesser for it.</b>

1109
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:10,140
我不愿意从黑暗空间获得能量
<b>I've hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension.</b>

1110
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,390
但你知道
<b>But as you well know...</b>

1111
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,840
有时人总得打破常规
<b>sometimes one must break the rules...</b>

1112
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:15,720
追求自己认为的那些更高的理想
<b>in order to serve the greater good.</b>

1113
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,890
但是莫度不是这样想的
<b>Mordo won't see it that way.</b>

1114
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,600
莫度生性固执 不善变通
<b>Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable...</b>

1115
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:22,900
这是他成长环境造就的
<b>forged by the fires of his youth.</b>

1116
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,900
而你灵活多变
<b>He needs your flexibility...</b>

1117
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:27,030
身处逆境 仍能顺势而生
<b>just as you need his strength.</b>

1118
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:31,820
只有你们的优势互补 才有可能战胜多玛姆
<b>Only together do you stand a chance of stopping Dormammu.</b>

1119
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,540
我还没准备好
<b>rn not ready.</b>

1120
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,040
没人准备好
<b>No one ever is.</b>

1121
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:40,870
我们无法左右世界
<b>We don't get to choose our time.</b>

1122
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,220
死亡赋予生命意义
<b>Death is what gives life meaning.</b>

1123
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:50,930
让你知道时光短暂
<b>To know your days are numbered.</b>

1124
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:53,050
去日无多
<b>Your time is short.</b>

1125
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:57,310
我已经准备好迎接死亡了
<b>You'd think after all this time, I'd be ready.</b>

1126
01:25:58,270 --> 01:25:59,980
看看吧
<b>But look at me.</b>

1127
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:03,060
我却多么想无限延长这一刻
<b>Stretching one moment out into a thousand...</b>

1128
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,650
从而欣赏这美丽的雪景
<b>just so that I can watch the snow.</b>

1129
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,810
你没事吧
<b>Are you okay?</b>

1130
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:55,740
我不明白你发生了什么
<b>I don't understand whats happening.</b>

1131
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:56,990
我知道
<b>I know.</b>

1132
01:26:57,790 --> 01:27:00,660
但是我现在还是得走了
<b>But I have to go away now.</b>

1133
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:08,460
你说过失去双手并不是什么世界末日
<b>You said that losing my hands didn't have to be the end.</b>

1134
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:10,210
但这可能是个开始
<b>That it could be a beginning.</b>

1135
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,460
是的
<b>Yeah.</b>

1136
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:15,680
毕竟还有其它拯救生命的方式
<b>Because there are other ways to save lives.</b>

1137
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:20,300
更难的方式
<b>A harder way.</b>

1138
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,810
更奇怪的方式
<b>A weirder way.</b>

1139
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,810
帕尔默医生 请到急诊室
<b>Doctor Palmer to the ER, please.</b>

1140
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:28,520
帕尔默医生 请到急诊室
<b>Doctor Palmer to the ER.</b>

1141
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,660
我不想让你走
<b>I don't want you to go.</b>

1142
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:23,910
别闹了
<b>Stop!</b>

1143
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:31,640
香港

1144
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,820
选好你们的武器
<b>Choose your weapon wisely.</b>

1145
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,320
没有人可以侵犯圣殿
<b>No one steps foot in this Sanctum.</b>

1146
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:04,620
没有人
<b>No one.</b>

1147
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,770
卡西利亚斯
<b>Kaecilius.</b>

1148
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:24,430
你站错队了 王
<b>You're on the wrong side of history, Wong.</b>

1149
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,650
她死了
<b>She's dead.</b>

1150
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:39,950
你说得对
<b>You were right.</b>

1151
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,200
她并不是我以为的那样
<b>She wasn't who I thought she was.</b>

1152
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:46,110
其实她很矛盾
<b>She was complicated.</b>

1153
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:52,120
她是很矛盾
<b>Complicated?</b>

1154
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:59,130
黑暗空间是个动荡危险的地方
<b>The Dark Dimension is volatile. Dangerous.</b>

1155
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:01,170
万一她被吞噬了呢
<b>What if it overtook her?</b>

1156
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:05,430
她告诉我们不能那么做
<b>She taught us it was forbidden...</b>

1157
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:10,220
可她自己却从中汲取能量 维持了好几百年的寿命
<b>while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life.</b>

1158
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,150
她做了认为正确的事
<b>She did what she thought was right.</b>

1159
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,940
是时候付出代价了
<b>The bill comes due.</b>

1160
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:16,270
你没看到吗
<b>Don't you see?</b>

1161
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:21,240
她的违禁之举为多玛姆带去了无数狂热者
<b>Her transgressions led the Zealots to Dormammu.</b>

1162
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:24,790
卡西利亚斯更是她酿成的大错
<b>Kaecilius was her fault!</b>

1163
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:26,700
这还不算
<b>And here we are...</b>

1164
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:29,030
我们最终也成了她的棋子
<b>in the consequence of her deception.</b>

1165
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,750
世界危在旦夕
<b>A world on fire.</b>

1166
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:36,290
莫度 伦敦圣殿已经崩塌了
<b>Mordo, the London Sanctum has fallen.</b>

1167
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:38,250
纽约圣殿也被袭击了两次
<b>The New York one has been attacked twice.</b>

1168
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,930
你知道他们的下一个目标
<b>You know where theyre going next.</b>

1169
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:41,470
香港
<b>Hong Kong.</b>

1170
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,840
你曾经对我说 要誓死保卫圣殿
<b>You told me once to fight like my life depended on it...</b>

1171
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:44,920
那一天总会到来
<b>because one day, it might.</b>

1172
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:46,680
今天就是这一天
<b>Well, today is that day.</b>

1173
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,890
我需要你和我并肩作战
<b>I cannot defeat them alone.</b>

1174
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:08,700
圣殿已经崩塌了
<b>The Sanctums already fallen.</b>

1175
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:18,500
是黑暗空间
<b>The Dark Dimension.</b>

1176
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,760
多玛姆就要来了
<b>Dormammu is coming.</b>

1177
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:25,380
来不及了
<b>it's too late.</b>

1178
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:27,180
没有人能够阻止他
<b>Nothing can stop him.</b>

1179
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,810
那可不一定
<b>Not necessarily.</b>

1180
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,220
不
<b>No.</b>

1181
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:18,900
咒语生效了
<b>The spell's working.</b>

1182
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:22,650
我们还有一次机会
<b>Weve got a second chance.</b>

1183
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,250
不
<b>No!</b>

1184
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:14,880
王
<b>Wang.</b>

1185
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,940
打破了自然的法则 我知道
<b>Breaking the laws of nature. I know.</b>

1186
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,610
现在可不能停下
<b>Well, don't stop now.</b>

1187
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:31,660
等圣殿修复后
<b>When the Sanctum's restored,</b>

1188
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:32,900
他们会卷土重来
<b>they'll attack it again.</b>

1189
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,160
我们必须守护圣殿
<b>Weve got to defend it.</b>

1190
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:35,650
加油
<b>Come on!</b>

1191
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:04,930
振作点儿 斯特兰奇
<b>Get up, Strange.</b>

1192
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,440
继续战斗
<b>Get up and fight.</b>

1193
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:08,310
这事该了结了
<b>We can finish this.</b>

1194
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:11,610
你们战胜不了必然发生的事
<b>You can't fight the inevitable.</b>

1195
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:16,780
真是太漂亮了
<b>Isn't it beautiful?</b>

1196
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:20,700
超越时间的世界
<b>A world beyond time.</b>

1197
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:24,620
超越死亡
<b>Beyond death.</b>

1198
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,550
超越时间
<b>Beyond time...</b>

1199
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:31,290
斯特兰奇
<b>Strange.</b>

1200
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:05,490
他走了
<b>He's gone.</b>

1201
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,170
连他都抛弃了你们 俯首于多玛姆的力量
<b>Even Strange has left you and surrendered to his power.</b>

1202
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:45,370
多玛姆 我是来谈条件的
<b>Dormammu, I've come to bargain.</b>

1203
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:47,870
你是来送死的
<b>You've come to die.</b>

1204
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:52,300
你的世界现在归我了
<b>Your world is now my world...</b>

1205
01:36:52,590 --> 01:36:55,050
和其他世界一样
<b>like all worlds.</b>

1206
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:28,330
多玛姆 我是来谈条件的
<b>Dormammu, I've come to bargain.</b>

1207
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:31,330
你是来送死的
<b>You've come to die.</b>

1208
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:34,420
你的世界现在归我了
<b>Your world is now my...</b>

1209
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,090
发生了什么
<b>What is this?</b>

1210
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,100
是幻觉吗
<b>Illusion?</b>

1211
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:40,600
不 这是现实
<b>No. This is real.</b>

1212
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:42,180
很好
<b>Good.</b>

1213
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:55,480
多玛姆 我是来谈条件的
<b>Dormammu, I've come to bargain.</b>

1214
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:58,980
你 这是什么情况
<b>You've... What is happening?</b>

1215
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:02,360
正如你从你的世界给卡西利亚斯的能力一样
<b>Just as you gave Kaecilius powers from your dimension...</b>

1216
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:04,950
我也从我那儿带了点能力来
<b>I brought a little power from mine.</b>

1217
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:07,450
这是时间
<b>This is time.</b>

1218
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:11,080
无限 循环的 时间
<b>Endless looped time.</b>

1219
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:13,540
你好大的胆子
<b>You dare!</b>

1220
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:19,640
多玛姆 我是来谈条件的
<b>Dormammu, I've come to bargain.</b>

1221
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:22,920
你不可能总这么循环
<b>You cannot do this forever.</b>

1222
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,640
事实上 我可以
<b>Actually, I can.</b>

1223
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:27,260
现在不就是这样嘛
<b>This is how things are now.</b>

1224
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,470
你和我 困在这同一时刻里
<b>You and me, trapped in this moment...</b>

1225
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:31,650
无限循环
<b>endlessly.</b>

1226
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:35,480
那你就这么无数次死去吧
<b>Then you will spend eternity dying.</b>

1227
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:36,750
没错
<b>Yes.</b>

1228
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:39,780
可地球上的人们会活下来
<b>But everyone on Earth will live.</b>

1229
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:41,530
那你就得受苦了
<b>But you will suffer.</b>

1230
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:43,660
我早习以为常了
<b>Pain's an old friend.</b>

1231
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:47,660
多玛姆
<b>Dormammu...</b>

1232
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,000
我是来谈条件的
<b>I've come to bargain.</b>

1233
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:50,160
给我停下
<b>End this!</b>

1234
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:53,040
多玛姆 多玛姆 多玛姆
<b>Dormammu... Dormammu... Dormammu...</b>

1235
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:12,260
你一定会输的
<b>You will never win.</b>

1236
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:14,680
是啊
<b>No...</b>

1237
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,860
但我输得起
<b>but I can lose...</b>

1238
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:20,310
反复
<b>again and again...</b>

1239
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:22,070
再反复
<b>and again...</b>

1240
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:24,860
多少次 也不会停止
<b>and again, forever.</b>

1241
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:27,860
你就哪儿也别想去了
<b>And that makes you my prisoner.</b>

1242
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,280
不
<b>No!</b>

1243
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:30,360
停下
<b>Stop!</b>

1244
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:33,580
你给我停下
<b>Make this stop!</b>

1245
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:35,870
放我出去
<b>Set me free!</b>

1246
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:37,870
不
<b>No.</b>

1247
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:40,340
我是来谈条件的
<b>I've come to bargain.</b>

1248
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:44,380
你想谈什么条件
<b>What do you want?</b>

1249
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:48,220
带你的信徒们离开地球
<b>Take your Zealots from the Earth.</b>

1250
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,890
停止在我们的世界作恶
<b>End your assault on my world.</b>

1251
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,930
再也不准回来
<b>Never come back.</b>

1252
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,510
你同意
<b>Do it...</b>

1253
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:57,270
我就停止循环
<b>and I'll break the loop.</b>

1254
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:07,910
振作点儿 斯特兰奇
<b>Get up, Strange!</b>

1255
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:09,320
继续战斗
<b>Get up and fight.</b>

1256
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,540
这事该了结了
<b>We can finish this.</b>

1257
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,070
真是太漂亮了
<b>Isn't it beautiful?</b>

1258
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:17,920
超越时间的世界
<b>A world beyond time.</b>

1259
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:22,090
超越死亡
<b>Beyond death.</b>

1260
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:35,270
你都做了什么
<b>What have you done?</b>

1261
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,980
我的条件谈成了
<b>I made a bargain.</b>

1262
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:40,940
这是怎么了
<b>What is this?</b>

1263
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:44,860
噢 这是 这正是你想要的一切
<b>Well, it's everything you've ever wanted.</b>

1264
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:48,110
作为多玛姆生命的一部分
<b>Eternal life as part of the One.</b>

1265
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,490
你真的不会喜欢的
<b>Youre not gonna like it.</b>

1266
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:13,720
实话跟你说
<b>Yeah, you know, you really should have</b>

1267
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:16,730
你真的应该偷走那整本书
<b>stolen the whole book because the warnings...</b>

1268
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:19,060
警示就在咒语的后面
<b>The warnings come after the spells.</b>

1269
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:30,150
好笑
<b>Oh, thats funny.</b>

1270
01:41:57,770 --> 01:41:59,010
你成功了
<b>We did it.</b>

1271
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:03,020
是啊
<b>Yes.</b>

1272
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:05,530
我们成功了
<b>Yes, we did it.</b>

1273
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:07,940
但是你也算是破坏了
<b>By also violating...</b>

1274
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,690
自然法则
<b>the natural law.</b>

1275
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:13,200
你看看周围 都结束了
<b>Look around you. It's over.</b>

1276
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,160
你还是觉得这没什么大不了的 对吧
<b>You still think there will be no consequences, Strange?</b>

1277
01:42:17,630 --> 01:42:19,290
没有后果
<b>No price to pay?</b>

1278
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:22,870
我们像她一样 打破了规则
<b>We broke our rules, just like her.</b>

1279
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,340
迟早会 付出 代价
<b>The bill comes due.</b>

1280
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:29,130
这是注定的
<b>Always!</b>

1281
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:31,550
因果报应
<b>A reckoning.</b>

1282
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:37,480
我不想再继续下去了
<b>I will follow this path no longer.</b>

1283
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:12,850
是啊 好吧
<b>Yeah, okay.</b>

1284
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:23,520
明智的选择
<b>Wise choice.</b>

1285
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,360
等你掌握了这个能量
<b>You'll wear the Eye of Agamotto...</b>

1286
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:28,690
就可以佩戴上它了
<b>once you've mastered it's powers.</b>

1287
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:29,940
不过呢
<b>Until then...</b>

1288
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,690
最好不要带着这个无限宝石走在大街上
<b>best not to walk the streets wearing an Infinity Stone.</b>

1289
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:34,820
什么石
<b>A what?</b>

1290
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,290
你可能有神秘法术的天赋
<b>You might have a gift for the mystic arts,</b>

1291
01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:40,210
但是你还需要潜心学习
<b>but you still have much to learn.</b>

1292
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:43,340
古一去世的消息
<b>Word of the Ancient Ones death</b>

1293
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:45,330
很快就会传遍多元宇宙
<b>will spread through the Multiverse.</b>

1294
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:47,960
地球没有至上尊者的守卫
<b>Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it.</b>

1295
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:49,460
我们得准备好
<b>We must be ready.</b>

1296
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:50,620
时刻准备着
<b>Well be ready.</b>

1297
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:36,000
奇异博士

1298
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:40,470
地球上现在都有法师了
<b>So Earth has wizards now, huh?</b>

1299
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:43,460
茶
<b>Tea?</b>

1300
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:45,470
我不想喝茶
<b>I don't drink tea.</b>

1301
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:46,550
那你喝点什么
<b>What do you drink?</b>

1302
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:49,270
不喝茶
<b>Not tea.</b>

1303
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:54,310
其实我留了一份
<b>So, I keep a watch list...</b>

1304
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:56,310
可能会对这个世界造成威胁的
<b>of individuals and beings from other realms</b>

1305
01:46:56,450 --> 01:46:57,730
人类和其他生物的黑名单
<b>that may be a threat to this world.</b>

1306
01:46:57,990 --> 01:47:01,570
你那个被收养的弟弟 洛基 就是其中之一
<b>Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.</b>

1307
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,660
他实至名归
<b>Worthy inclusion.</b>

1308
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:06,910
是啊
<b>Yeah.</b>

1309
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:12,080
那你为什么还把他带到纽约来呢
<b>So why bring him here to New York?</b>

1310
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,750
说来话长
<b>it's a bit of a long story.</b>

1311
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,830
家长里短 乱七八糟的
<b>Family drama, that kind of thing.</b>

1312
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:17,670
我们是来找我父亲的
<b>But we're looking for my father.</b>

1313
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:21,390
那好吧 如果你们 找到了奥丁
<b>Oh, okay. So if you found Odin...</b>

1314
01:47:21,470 --> 01:47:24,510
你们就会及时返回阿斯加德吗
<b>youd all return to Asgard promptly?</b>

1315
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,970
噢 当然 马上
<b>Oh, yes. Promptly.</b>

1316
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:27,550
好极了
<b>Great!</b>

1317
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:30,470
那我来帮你
<b>Allow me to help you.</b>

1318
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:32,830
需要点什么
<b>Can I help you?</b>

1319
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:37,210
当时你是被他们抬到卡玛泰基来的
<b>They carried you into Kamar-Taj on a stretcher.</b>

1320
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,720
现在可大不一样了 潘博恩
<b>Look at you now, Pang born.</b>

1321
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:43,090
莫度
<b>Mordo.</b>

1322
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:47,770
我能为你做点什么
<b>So what can I do for you, man?</b>

1323
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:49,690
我出游了几个月
<b>I've been away for many months now,</b>

1324
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:51,520
无意中听说
<b>and I'vehad a revelation.</b>

1325
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,940
法师的真正目的
<b>The true purpose of a sorcerer...</b>

1326
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:57,860
是扭转事物的本来形态
<b>is to twist things out of their proper shape...</b>

1327
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,280
偷走法力
<b>stealing power...</b>

1328
01:54:01,120 --> 01:54:02,610
违背规则
<b>perverting nature.</b>

1329
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:04,620
就像你一样
<b>Like you.</b>

1330
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:07,920
我没有偷法力 那本来就是
<b>I've stolen nothing. This is my power.</b>

1331
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:09,880
我的
<b>Mine.</b>

1332
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:10,790
法力
<b>Power...</b>

1333
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,580
自有其目的
<b>has a purpose.</b>

1334
01:54:27,650 --> 01:54:29,760
你为什么要这么做
<b>Why are you doing this?</b>

1335
01:54:29,980 --> 01:54:33,150
因为我终于发现了世界的症结所在
<b>Because I see, at long last, what's wrong with the world.</b>

1336
01:54:38,450 --> 01:54:40,570
法师太多了
<b>Too many sorcerers.</b>

1337
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,430
敬请期待奇异博士再度回归
