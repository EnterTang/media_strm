2
00:00:15,393 --> 00:00:17,239
My name is Jackson Norris.

3
00:00:17,354 --> 00:00:19,778
Today will be the most
important in my career.

4
00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:23,767
My final interview with
the most infamous prisoner in America.

5
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:28,553
A man that the world thought was
a terrorist called the Mandarin.

6
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,370
But is now alleged to be
nothing but an actor.

7
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:34,610
Thus far, the subject has been evasive.

8
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:37,942
And apparently oblivious to
the point of my work.

9
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:41,392
In fact, he seems to be oblivious to
pretty much everything.

10
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,114
Except his own growing celebrity.

11
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:45,691
Here he comes! Here he comes!

12
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:48,920
Because now, the whole world
knows his name.

13
00:00:49,022 --> 00:00:50,022
Trevor! Trevor!

14
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,070
This is my last chance to get
beyond his lies and excuses

15
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:57,775
to confront the subject with
elements of his own past

16
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:00,074
in order to unlock the truth

17
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:03,106
because we need to know
once and for all:

18
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:06,175
Who is Trevor Slattery?

19
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:19,834
Bloody hell.

20
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:21,999
It's not exactly the Ritz, is it.

21
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,475
Stop right there!

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,058
Come on Mr Slattery, you know
you're supposed to wait for me.

23
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:32,142
Lunch time ain't safe around here
for a celebrity like yourself.

24
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:35,402
So, Herman, with whom shall we lunch today?

25
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:38,650
Serial killers? Nonces?
I hear the triads are a good giggle.

26
00:01:38,796 --> 00:01:40,705
Now remember sir, you
have your 3 O'Clock with Mr Norris.

27
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,686
If only my mother could see me

28
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:44,150
in my very own documentary.

29
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,539
I still think you should've done
that exclusive with "60 Minutes".

30
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:48,907
I told you I'll never work
with CBS again!

31
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:51,448
Wait, Herman!
Where is my choci milk?

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,376
I'm so sorry sir.
I'll be right back.

33
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:56,352
And while you're there,
can you see if they've got any kale.

34
00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:57,547
I'm on it!

35
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,320
Bollocks.

36
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:03,748
You ruined my jumpsuit, bitch.

37
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:05,037
Chill.

38
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,321
- You know what I want right now?
- Autograph?

39
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:13,106
I want to give the world exactly
what it's been crying out for:

40
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:16,345
Your dead body,
laid out on the goddamn slab.

41
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:18,630
Ey, Crackle!

42
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:21,050
What's up!

43
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:25,670
It's the fanbase.

44
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,398
Kiss my rings, bitch.

45
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:42,272
You're not the Mandarin, Slattery.

46
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:45,324
You're not even a real criminal.

47
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:47,075
Au contraire, Dave.

48
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:49,319
When an actor has inhabited
a role as long as I have

49
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:52,374
he often becomes it and it him.

50
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:55,915
Uh, Mr Slattery?

51
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:58,817
Me and the boys was just wondering

52
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:02,016
if you could do, uh ...
could do the voice.

53
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:05,497
Fletcher, it's not something
I can just turn on.

54
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:09,635
I'm not your meat puppet ...
Oh very well.

55
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:20,804
And you'll never see me coming.

56
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:26,609
Oooh! I told you!
I told you he was gonna do it.

57
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,962
- Thank you!
- No, no, I thank you.

58
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:30,640
And I thank you.

59
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:33,219
And I ... oh! My choci milk.

60
00:03:35,443 --> 00:03:36,816
I'm ready when you are.

61
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:46,728
Vocal warm-ups.
Old habit from my stage walk.

62
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,333
I can imagine starting out

63
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,534
you never thought you'd
end up in some place like this.

64
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:55,611
Yeah, not bad eh, that whole ...
on people thing gets the VIP treatment.

65
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:57,637
It looks like you're living comfortably.

66
00:03:57,788 --> 00:03:59,571
There are things that I miss.

67
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:06,355
Ketamine, obviously, and the birds but

68
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,179
you know, you make do in that department.

69
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,870
I mean before being to
drama school I've been not.

70
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,509
Know what I'm saying?

71
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:15,571
Okay, look, Trevor, this is our last day.

72
00:04:15,987 --> 00:04:18,155
- Last day?
- Yes, finally.

73
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:21,068
And, uh, we've covered a lot
of the logistics:

74
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,919
Your recruitment by Aldrich Killian

75
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:26,035
creation of an amalgam warlord
by his think-tank.

76
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,384
Whom I brought to life.
Carry on.

77
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:32,159
The one questions that most people ask me
when I tell them that I know you

78
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:35,841
is that ... how could you have
not known what was going on?

79
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:38,637
Three little words.

80
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:41,638
The lovely drugs.

81
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,027
Okay ...

82
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,376
To bring this film to a close

83
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:49,244
I'd like to know more
about the man behind the mask.

84
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:51,377
The real Trevor Slattery.

85
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,586
You know, with all the Internet
gossip and Tabloid expos�es

86
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:56,723
not much is known about
you personally.

87
00:04:57,108 --> 00:05:02,668
Well, I think that an actor does better
to keep a shred of mystery, otherwise

88
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,171
you know, it can colour
the audiences perception.

89
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:07,309
What've you got there?

90
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:11,281
I found this in the vaults of an
English newspaper called the 'Liverpool Echo'.

91
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,912
That's you and your mother, right?

92
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:15,292
Yeah, it is ...

93
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,111
October 12th 1964.

94
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:24,514
It was there I landed my first role.

95
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,524
Boatswain 1, Shakespeare's Tempest.

96
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:30,759
Obviously I told her it was the lead,
I always was a bloody great liar.

97
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:33,887
- So I assume the two of you were close ...
- She ...

98
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:37,914
... was everything to me!

99
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:41,258
She passed in 1986 but you
weren't there when she died.

100
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:44,967
No, I wasn't. I was here in America
for my big break.

101
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:48,519
This would be the TV pilot
for the CBS network.

102
00:05:48,552 --> 00:05:54,008
"Caged Heat", wonderful piece
about avenging russian police cop

103
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,684
with anger issues.
Let loose on Los Angeles.

104
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,328
I wish I had a copy.
I wish I had copy.

105
00:06:01,438 --> 00:06:04,658
Actually, Trevor I managed to find
some footage of that as well.

106
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:49,555
Handsome lad!
Handsome lad!

107
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:50,910
Yeah, it's compelling.

108
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:54,845
Sean Connery made a
pass at me once.

109
00:06:55,532 --> 00:06:58,466
Everyone on the set called him Mr Connery.

110
00:06:58,642 --> 00:07:02,589
He called me Trev.
"You're very talented, Trev."

111
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:05,625
That's fascinating.
Was that a monkey drinking vodka?

112
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:08,839
Yes, yes! And still those nobs
at the network didn't pick it up!

113
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:11,421
I think it was too sophisticated for them.

114
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:13,606
That was the break that broke me.

115
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:14,796
Right there.

116
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:18,430
You seem to typify your life
as a series of missed opportunities

117
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:21,265
but yet you don't tend to
take responsibility for many of them.

118
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:26,042
My responsibility is to my muse.
I'm an actor, love.

119
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,746
Not a bloody rocket surgeon.

120
00:07:29,222 --> 00:07:34,298
But possibly, your betrayal
has angered some people.

121
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,356
I mean, some whom are
very dangerous.

122
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:38,911
You don't have to tell me, mate

123
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:41,629
I've seen those bloody
Internet message boards.

124
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:42,787
Vicious!

125
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:47,131
I'm not talking about the message boards.
I'm talking about the "Ten Rings".

126
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,243
- Come again?
- The terrorist group.

127
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,804
Historically associated with the Mandarin.

128
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:53,632
Officially they're dormant

129
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:55,873
but evidence suggests that
they're becoming more active.

130
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,819
What the "Ten Rings",
are they real?

131
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:01,057
It's all documented.

132
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,839
That is so cool!

133
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:07,271
Trevor, you told me, when you got this role
that you had researched it thoroughly.

134
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:10,288
Yeah, but when an actor tells you
he's done the research

135
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,683
it means he's switched on his computer,
googled his own name and had a quick wank.

136
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,887
So, you mean to tell me ...

137
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:23,123
... that you don't know the history
of the Mandarin himself.

138
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:30,448
He was a warror king, who inspired generations
of men through the middle ages.

139
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:32,498
Perhaps even further back in time.

140
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:34,774
Who bloody cares mate?

141
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:36,963
It's a show people want
and I gave them a good one.

142
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:41,411
It's not the Mandarin they'll remember,
it's the name: "Trevor Slattery".

143
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:43,347
It's a brand. "Trev".

144
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:47,474
You're right. And for that sin you will soon

145
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,852
suffer horribly with a hole in your body

146
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:51,437
for every ring of our faith.

147
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,177
Sorry, what.

148
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:55,570
You heard me.

149
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:05,954
Get up, big lad. Get up.

150
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:26,978
You ...

151
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,490
You killed my butler.

152
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,834
You're not capable of pulling
that trigger, Mr Slattery.

153
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:38,613
I'm an out of work actor, love.
You've no idea what I'm capable of.

154
00:09:38,873 --> 00:09:42,129
And thanks to the CBS network
I'm pretty good with a handgun.

155
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:49,815
Consider this a lesson in what's real
and what's not.

156
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:53,270
Why do people keep pointing guns at my head.

157
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:55,961
Please, I don't want do die!

158
00:09:56,315 --> 00:10:00,233
I don't want ...
... to die.

159
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:01,653
Target acquired and in position.

160
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:03,844
Extraction unit, mobilize.

161
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:06,143
I'm not the one that's going
to kill you, Mr Slattery.

162
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:08,025
I'm here to break you out.

163
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:10,465
That's nice.

164
00:10:11,148 --> 00:10:12,836
Not really. You see ...

165
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,231
... there's somebody who wants
to meet you.

166
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,531
- Do I know him?
- No.

167
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:21,719
But you took his name.
And now he wants it back.

168
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:27,870
No. Sorry.
I still don't get it.

169
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:05,237
Uh, Mr Slattery?

170
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:08,373
Me and the boys was just wondering

171
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:11,420
if you could do, uh ...
could do the voice.

172
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,673
- Jackass.
- Whatever.

173
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,841
Where have you been?

174
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,648
I could've read a book in
the time you were gone.

175
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:23,758
And you'll never see me coming ...

176
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,480
Look at this guy,
what is so special about him?

177
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:30,761
I mean, I had an army of robots.
What's he got? He's got some dumb accent.

178
00:11:30,971 --> 00:11:33,329
His name's Trevor. What is that?

179
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:37,251
It's like if Bin Laden and
Benny Hill had a baby.

180
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:17,280
And then I gotta wake up
and look at this chick?

181
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:24,540
Pepper Potts stirs up stuff. Look at me!
Some second rate jumped up amazon secretary.

182
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:27,211
Tony and I ... Tony and ... Tony's cool.

183
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,676
Tony and I, we have an understanding.
We're like brothers-in-arms.

184
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,392
Literally.
We're both arms dealers.

185
00:12:34,847 --> 00:12:37,591
Both good looking. Both have nice hair.

186
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:40,265
Both have boats.

187
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:41,850
I used to have a boat.

188
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,093
Not here baby, not here.

188
00:12:47,305 --> 00:12:53,321
