00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,120
打住
Don't.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,140
啊？
What?

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,200
我都料到你想说什么了
I can just feel you about to say it.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,400
反正你别说出来
Just don't say it.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,120
我觉得我们不该冲动
I think we should bail.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,100
小本，现在说这个已经太迟了
Benny, it's too late for that.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,440
拜托，克莱尔，我们...
C'mon Claire, we..

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,880
我们压根儿不清楚自己在干什么
We don't know what we're dealing here

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,340
我清楚啊
I do.

11
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,140
不，你不清楚
No, you don't!

12
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,100
不，我清楚得很
Yes, I do!

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,560
我真的很清楚好么 
I really do okay,

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,680
那玩意儿就这么从天而降
That thing fell out of the sky,

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,880
掉到我们怀里
into our laps.I mean,

16
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,600
我相信这就是一种暗示
to me that's a sign, okay?

17
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,940
你凭什么那么确定这东西会
What makes you so sure that

18
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,140
为我们指向一个正确的方向？
the sign is pointing in the right direction?

19
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,260
因为你啊
You make me sure.

20
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,300
是你启动了它
Cause you got it to work.

21
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,400
你总说我们值得拥有更好的未来，不是么？
Always said that we deserve better, right?

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,600
所以，我不想再苦苦等着别人给我们机会
So, i don't wanna wait for somebody to give us a chance.

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,160
是时候由我们自己创造自己的未来了
It's time that we took a chance for ourselves.

24
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,060
但愿你是对的
I hope you're right.

25
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,900
会的，我总都是对的
I am, I'm always right.

26
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,200
正如我选择对了你
I'm always right about you.

27
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,280
好吧
Okay.

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,060
加油
Okay.

29
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,940

Okay.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,840
（快离开这里！快点！）
(Get out! Go! Go!)

35
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,360
你现在看到的是宾夕法尼亚州的艾伦镇

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,920
（抱歉，你还好么）
(Sorry, are you okay?)

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
这是最糟糕的情况
This is a worst case scenario.

39
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,500
请告诉我为什么一件失灵的外星武器
Please tell me why is the one piece of Alien techie failed

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,340
突然间又可以用了

41
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,860
（快跑）
(Let's go.)

42
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,340

49
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,700
（小本！）
(Benny!)

50
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,540
（-小本！ -我得走了）

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,840
我去过那里
I have been there.

55
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,000
那里街尾的猪肉卷特别好吃呢
They do a great pulled pork right down the street.

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,000
我怎么觉得你对这个任务一点儿也不严肃
I don't think you're taking this assignment very seriously.

57
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,440
真巧，我也刚想这么说你呢
That's funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.

58
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,240
在你收集那些监控录像的时候
While you've been in here gathering video clips

59
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,580
我已经在外面调查好了
I've been out investigating.

60
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,340
发现在基维斯特岛刚卖出一艘28英尺的皮尔森游艇
It turns out a used 28 foot Pearson was taken off the marker in Key West.

61
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,820
根据卖家交代
Spoke to the former owner,

62
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,040
是被一对夫妇用现金买走了

63
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,280
游艇刚驶出不到24小时
Boat gets out of Dry Dock in 24 hours.

64
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,020
所以
So...

65
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,260
我认为该采取行动了
I'd like to get a move on.

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,920
我明白，因为科尔森探员
I understand, Agent Coulson.

67
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,900
抱歉，老毛病
I'm sorry, force of habit.

68
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,760
我们都怀念他
We all miss him.

69
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,160
西特韦尔探员，给你的任务

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,060
缴回武器
Retrieve the weapons tech,

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,940
干掉那两个...

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
不法之徒
the two outlaws.

73
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,380
南福罗里达州

74
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,700
这武器快把我的手腕废了
Thing's a killer on the wrist.

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,440
就像得了...
Feels i'm getting advanced...

76
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,200
腕管综合症什么的
carpal tunnel or something

77
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,900
怎么了
What?

78
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,180
我们成功了
We did it.

79
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,680
多少钱？
How much?

80
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,720
够多了
Enough.

81
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,000
多到什么程度？
Enough enough?

82
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,080
多到够我们逍遥自在了
Enough to do whatever we want.

83
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,300
从现在到永远
Now and forever.

84
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,420
隔壁在搞什么鬼？
What the hell is that?

85
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,440
额，我喜欢这首歌
Oh, i like that song.

86
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,020
你能不能...
Can you please...

87
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,660
好的，没问题，我这就去说几句
Yup, okay.. okay, i'll say something.

88
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,140
你就这么躺着，不要动，我马上回来
Just stay right there, don't move, I'll be right back

89
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,860
有人么？
Hello?

90
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,000
不要再挣扎了
Please stop squirming.

91
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,200
班杰明，如果你不再挣扎就会舒...
Banjamin this would go a lot smoother if...

92
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,160
克莱尔，有警察！
Claire, it's the cops!

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,720
快卧倒！宝贝儿
Hit the deck, baby.

94
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,960
呀，我的手腕
Ay, my wrist...

95
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,320
小本！

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,500
小本你还好么？

你得让它多冷却一会儿
You should go a lot cooler!

99
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
小本？
Benny?

100
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,720
小本？
Benny?

101
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,600
或许我们还能...
Maybe we can do...

102
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,180
还想冒险？
Risky?

103
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:39,860
或许还能...
something...

104
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,740
你知道我们刚才在哪个位置么？
Did you even know where we were?

105
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,540
当然知道
I do...

106
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,260
你确定？
You knew?

107
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,120
我知道我在做什么
I knew what I was doing.

108
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,460
听着，我们会被抓去关了
Listen, we're gonna get arrested.

109
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,480
好吧，嘘，嘘
Okay, shh shh

110
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,060
嗨，嗨...刚才的事非常抱歉
Hi, hi.. I'm so sorry about before.

111
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,700
希望我没有...伤到你
I hope i didn't hurt you..?

112
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,560
曼哈顿上空的传送门关闭之后
47 known alien objects hit the ground

113
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,280
有47件外星武器从天而降
after the portal closed above Manhattan.

114
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,240
全都失灵
All dormant,

115
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,680
全都坏了

除了这个
Execpt this one.

117
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,800
只有这个还能用
This one works just fine.

118
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,660
知道为什么不？
Any idea why that is?

119
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,080
是小本启动的
Benny got it to work.

120
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
看什么？就是你啊
What? You did.

121
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,760
好吧我可以启动给你看

他很乐意演示给你看
He would love to show you.

128
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,320
怎么样都行，就是别...别抓我们入狱
Just anything, but we can't...we can't go to jail.

129
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,040
看看他，他挨不了监狱的
Look at him, he can't go to jail.

130
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,720
谁说要让你们进监狱了
Who said anything about jail?

131
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,940
我的任务是缴回武器
I was sent here to retrieve the weapon,

132
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,940
然后把你们清理掉

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,560
（通过验证）

135
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,440
你特么死哪儿去了
Where the hell have you been?

136
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,500
10个小时之前就该报告了

汽车旅馆要求赔偿损失42000美元
42,000$ worth a damage at the motel,

138
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,500

139
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,120
