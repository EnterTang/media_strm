00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:26,272
- It didn't go well, did it ?
- No, it did not.

3
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:29,177
- Did they reject the Initiative ?
- Of course not,

4
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:31,668
They gave me the most idiotic
ill-conceived request imaginable.

5
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:34,185
They want Blonsky on the team.

6
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:35,534
The Abomination?

7
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:36,525
They really don't like when
you call him that.

8
00:00:36,696 --> 00:00:37,412
But the Harlem Incident...

9
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:42,200
They're pinning that on Banner.

10
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:43,174
On Banner?

11
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:44,102
Not the guy you wanna make angry.

12
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:46,567
They consider Blonsky a war hero.

13
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:50,523
They want him exonerated, released
and then added to the roster.

14
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,288
They think we have him.

15
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:55,266
What's your clearance level ?

16
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:57,368
That's funny, it's level 6...

17
00:00:58,611 --> 00:00:59,329
...like you.

18
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:02,547
Come on, there's a level 7?

19
00:01:03,706 --> 00:01:05,296
Blonsky is in custody in General Ross' sector.

20
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:07,320
Does director Fury even want Blonsky?

21
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:09,499
Of course not, but he can't ignore
an explicit directive

22
00:01:09,606 --> 00:01:11,064
from the World Security Counsel...

23
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:13,544
...so we have to make sure he doesn't have to.

24
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:14,766
How the hell are we gonna do that?

25
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:18,795
I have no idea, but we have to send a
liaison to the General within 24 hours.

26
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:21,296
So, on the Counsel's order, we have to
send one of our people

27
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:23,541
down to the General Ross as for Blonsky,
who we don't even want.

28
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:24,381
Exactly.

29
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:30,800
I got it.

30
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:32,680
We send a patsy to sabotage
the debrief.

31
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:33,528
A patsy ?

32
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:36,332
Yeah, someone to screw it up. Someone
so inept the General Ross will

33
00:01:36,657 --> 00:01:37,695
refuse to release Blonsky.

34
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:40,087
I can do it. I do a great patsy.

35
00:01:40,597 --> 00:01:44,600
Yes you do. Your patsy is legendary.
In fact, when I think of the world patsy-

36
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:45,338
Alright.

37
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:46,666
Well I'm thinking, for this we need

38
00:01:46,677 --> 00:01:48,636
a slightly different skill set.

39
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:49,973
If we want the general to
refuse this request,

40
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:52,392
then we have to sent someone who
will truly annoy him.

41
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:56,773
...someone arrogant and abrasive,
with an utter disdain for authority,

42
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:59,571
someone who will offend
the general to his very core-

43
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,534
- You're talking about the Consul-
- No I'm not.

44
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:02,707
You just described him to a T.

45
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:05,051
I'm telling you right now, stop it,
I'm not calling the Consultant.

46
00:02:12,556 --> 00:02:14,491
<i>Smell of steel, beer... and defeat.</i>

47
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:18,527
You know I hate to say "I told you so." General
but that Super soldier program

48
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:20,033
was put on ice for a reason.

49
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:24,287
I always felt the hardware was much more reliable...

50
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:25,549
Stark.

51
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:27,505
General.

52
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:31,391
You always wear such nice suits.

53
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:33,167
Touché.

54
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,568
Here you have an unusual problem.

55
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:38,148
You should talk.

56
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:39,715
You should listen.

57
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,927
So. Any word?

58
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:53,645
Mission accomplished.

59
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:56,524
The Abomination will remain in his cage for now.

60
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:58,586
Apparently the Consultant outdid himself.

61
00:02:58,716 --> 00:03:01,089
Ross got so mad he tried to have
him removed from the bar.

62
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,326
How did that go over?

63
00:03:03,536 --> 00:03:04,433
Stark bought the place.

64
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:08,133
It's scheduled for demolition on Thursday.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,131
