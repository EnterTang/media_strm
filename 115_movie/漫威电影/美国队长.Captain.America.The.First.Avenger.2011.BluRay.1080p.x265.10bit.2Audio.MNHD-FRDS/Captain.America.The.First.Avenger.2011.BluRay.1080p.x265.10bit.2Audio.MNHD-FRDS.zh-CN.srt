6
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,280
You're the guys from Washington?

7
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,200
You get many other visitors out here?

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,820
How long you been on site?

9
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,910
Since this morning.

10
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,330
A Russian oil team called it in about 18 hours ago.

11
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,700
How come nobody's spotted it before?

12
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,500
It's really not that surprising.

13
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,040
This landscapes changing all the time.

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,630
You got any idea what this thing is exactly?

15
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,670
I don't know, it's probably a weather balloon.

16
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,960
I don't think so.

17
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,840
You know we don't have the equipment for a job like this.

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,510
How long before we can start craning it out?

19
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,140
I don't think you quite understand.

20
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,350
You guys are going to need one hell of a crane.

21
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,730
Base, we're in.

22
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,950
What is this?

23
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,710
Careful.

24
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,860
Lieutenant.

25
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,030
- What is it? - My god.

26
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,620
Base, give me a line to the Colonel.

27
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,160
It's 3am, sir.

28
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,960
I don't care what time it is.

29
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,630
This one's waited long enough.

30
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,310
They've come for it.

31
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,390
They have before.

32
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,360
Not like this.

33
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,650
Let them come.

34
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,190
They'll never find it.

35
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,870
Open it.

36
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,990
Why can't you find it?

37
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,590
It has taken me a long time to find this place.

38
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,890
You should be commended.

39
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,640
Help him up.

40
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,770
I think that you are a man of great vision.

41
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,430
And in this way we are much alike.

42
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,570
I am nothing like you.

43
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,320
Of course but what others see as superstition,

44
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,700
you and I know to be as science.

45
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,000
What you seek is just a legend.

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,290
Then why make such an effort to conceal it?

47
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,440
The tesseract was the jewel of Odin's treasure room.

48
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,410
It's not something one buries.

49
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,580
But I think it is close, yes.

50
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,450
I cannot help you.

51
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,540
No.

52
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,210
But maybe you can help your, uh village?

53
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,380
You must have some friends out there.

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,170
Some little grandchildren, perhaps.

55
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,090
You have no need for them to die.

56
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,480
Yggdrasil.

57
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,610
The Tree of the world.

58
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,950
Guardian of wisdom.

59
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,080
And fate also.

60
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,370
You have never seen this.

61
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,490
Have you?

62
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,620
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

63
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,250
Exactly.

64
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,550
Give the order to open fire.

65
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,290
Fool.

66
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,140
You cannot control the power you hold.

67
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,510
You will burn.

68
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,890
I already have.

69
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,280
O'Connell, Michael.

70
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Kaminski, Henry.

71
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,580
Boy, a lot of guys getting killed over there.

72
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,370
Rogers, Stephen.

73
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,420
Kinda makes you think twice about enlisting, huh?

74
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,920
Nope.

75
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,380
Rogers.

76
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,930
What did your father die of?

77
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:40,930
Mustard gas.

78
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,060
He was in the 107th infantry.

79
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,440
- I was hoping I could be assigned. - Mother?

80
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,230
She was a nurse in a TB ward.

81
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,810
Got hit.

82
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,980
Couldn't shake it.

83
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,110
Sorry son.

84
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,240
Well just give me a chance.

85
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,410
You'll be ineligible on your asthma alone.

86
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,530
Is there anything you can do?

87
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,540
I'm doing it.

88
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,290
I'm saving your life.

89
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,250
War continues to ravage Europe.

90
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,880
But help is on the way.

91
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,800
Every able bodied young man is lining up to serve his country.

92
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,560
Even little Timmy is doing his part.

93
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,060
Collecting scrap metal.

94
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,770
Nice work, Timmy.

95
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,810
Who cares!

96
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,570
Play the movie already.

97
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,480
Hey, want to show some respect.

98
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,730
Meanwhile, over seas...

99
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,490
..Our brave boys are showing the Axis Powers...

100
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,950
..That the price of freedom is never to high.

101
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,450
Let's go, get on with it.

102
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,200
Hey, just start the cartoon.

103
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,450
Hey, you want to shut up.

104
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,710
Together with allied forces,

105
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,670
we'll face any threat, no matter the size.

106
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,900
You just don't know when to give up, do you.

107
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,690
I can do this all day.

108
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,530
Hey, pick on someone your own size.

109
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,040
Sometimes I think you like getting punched.

110
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,290
I had him on the ropes.

111
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,300
How many times is this?

112
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,300
Oh, your from Paramus now.

113
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,140
You know it's illegal to lie on your enlistment form.

114
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,930
Seriously, Jersey?

115
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,890
You get your orders?

116
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,270
107th.

117
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,940
Sergeant James Barnes.

118
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,980
Shipping out for England first thing tomorrow.

119
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,860
I should be going.

120
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,160
Come on, man.

121
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,830
My last night.

122
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,250
Gotta get you cleaned off.

123
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,660
Why, where we going?

124
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,330
The future.

125
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't see what the problem is.

126
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,760
You're about to be the last eligible man in New York.

127
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,050
You know there's three and a half million women here.

128
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,140
Yeah, I'd settle for just one.

129
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,390
Good thing I took care of that.

130
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,100
Hey, Bucky!

131
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,690
What'd you tell her about me?

132
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,980
Only the good stuff.

133
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,650
Welcome to the Modern Marvels Pavilion.

134
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,150
and the world of tomorrow.

135
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,280
A greater world.

136
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,370
A better world.

137
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,040
Oh my god.

138
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,540
It's starting.

139
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,880
Ladies and Gentlemen,

140
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,710
Mr. Howard Stark.

141
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,690
Ladies and Gentlemen.

142
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,110
What if I told you that in just a few short years,

143
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,030
Your automobile won't even have to touch the ground, at all.

144
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
Yes.

145
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,280
Thanks, Mandy.

146
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,660
With Starks Gravitic reversion technology.

147
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,660
You'll be able to do just that.

148
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,300
Holy cow.

149
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,640
Well I did say a few years, didn't I?

150
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,780
Hey, Steve. What do you say we treat these girls...

151
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,540
Come on, Soldier.

152
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,510
Come on, kinda missing the point of a double date.

153
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,010
We're taking the girls dancing.

154
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,760
You go ahead, I'll catch up with you.

155
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,680
You really gonna do this again?

156
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,230
Well it's a fair, I'm going to try my luck.

157
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,230
As who, Steve from Ohio?

158
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,560
They'll catch you or worse they'll actually take you.

159
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,230
Look I know you don't think I can do this.

160
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,980
This isn't a back alley, Steve, it's war.

161
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,860
- I know it's a war. - Then find something to fight,

162
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,990
..Start looking for a job.

163
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,870
What am I going to do, collect scrap.

164
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,700
Yes, I know that I'm...

165
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,370
I'm not going to sit in a factory, Bucky.

166
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,600
Bucky come on,

167
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,030
there are men laying down their lives.

168
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,200
I got no right to do any less than them.

169
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,460
That's what you don't understand.

170
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,210
This isn't about me.

171
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,250
Right.

172
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,170
'Cause you got nothing to prove.

173
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,760
Hey sorry. Are we going dancing?

174
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,890
Yes we are.

175
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,730
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.

176
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,690
How can I?

177
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,400
You're taking all the stupid with you.

178
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,650
You're a punk.

179
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,990
Jerk.

180
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,910
Careful.

181
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,660
Don't win the war 'til I get there.

182
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,290
Come on girls, playing our song.

183
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,690
Wait here.

184
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,230
Is there a problem?

185
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,570
Just wait here.

186
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,880
Thank you.

187
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
So.

188
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,510
You want to go overseas.

189
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,680
Kill some Nazis.

190
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,350
Excuse me.

191
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,940
Doctor Abraham Erskine.

192
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,940
I represent a Strategic Scientific Reserve.

193
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,900
Steve Rogers.

194
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,530
Where are you from?

195
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Queens.

196
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,320
73rd street and Utopla parkway.

197
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,450
Before that, Germany.

198
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,120
This troubles you?

199
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
No.

200
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,420
Where are you from, Mr. Rogers? Hmm?

201
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,290
Is it, New Haven?

202
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,840
Or, Paramus?

203
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,590
Five exams in five different cities...

204
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,300
It might not be the right file.

205
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,260
It's not the exams I'm interested in.

206
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,760
It's the five tries.

207
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,970
But you didn't answer my question.

208
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,020
Do you want to kill Nazis?

209
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,650
Is this a test?

210
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Yes.

211
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,360
I don't want to kill anyone.

212
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,700
I don't like bullies.

213
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,530
I don't care where they're from.

214
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,870
Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war.

215
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,870
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.

216
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,790
I can offer you a chance.

217
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,170
Only a chance.

218
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,090
I'll take it.

219
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,340
Good.

220
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,010
So where is the little guy from?

221
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,470
Actually.

222
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,600
Brooklyn.

223
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,480
Congratulations.

224
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,940
Soldier.

225
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,500
Are you ready, Doctor Zola?

226
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,760
The machine requires the most delicate calibration.

227
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,220
Forgive me if I seem over cautious.

228
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,430
Are you certain that those combatants of yours

229
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,690
...can withstand the energy surge,

230
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,440
...strong enough for a transference?

231
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,690
With this artifact.

232
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,690
I am certain of nothing.

233
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,320
I fear it may not work at all.

234
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,230
Twenty percent.

235
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,570
Forty.

236
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,490
Sixty.

237
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,950
Stabilizing at seventy percent.

238
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,000
I have not come all this way,

239
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,670
...for safety, Doctor.

240
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,230
What was that?

241
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,900
I must congratulate you, Arnim.

242
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,900
Your designs does not disappoint.

243
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,700
Though they may require some slight reinforcement.

244
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,950
The transmittion is stable.

245
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,370
Amazing.

246
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,750
The energy patch, you called it,

247
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,500
equipped all my designs.

248
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,130
All my designs.

249
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,840
This will change the war.

250
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,010
Doctor Zola.

251
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,760
This will change the world.

252
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,390
Recruits, attention!

253
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,440
Gentlemen, I'm Agent Carter.

254
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,320
I supervise all operations for this division.

255
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,440
What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?

256
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,820
Thought I was signing up for the U.S. Army.

257
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,950
What's your name, soldier?

258
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,070
Gilmore Hodge, your majesty.

259
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,280
Step forward, Hodge.

260
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,660
Put your right foot forward.

261
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,040
We gonna wrestle?

262
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,750
'Cause I gotta a few moves I know you'll like.

263
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,010
Agent Carter.

264
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,590
Colonel Phillips.

265
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,970
I can see that you are breaking in the candidates,

266
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,890
that's good.

267
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,890
Get your ass up out of that dirt,

268
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,180
..And stand up in that lineup at attention until,

269
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,770
...somebody comes and tells you what to do.

270
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,480
Yes, Sir.

271
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,520
General Patton.

272
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,730
Has said.

273
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,690
"War's are fought with weapons but they are won by men."

274
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,950
We are going to win this war, because...

275
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,870
...we have the best men.

276
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,620
And because they're gonna get better.

277
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,960
Much, better.

278
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,830
The Strategic Scientific Reserve.

279
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,840
Is an allied effort.

280
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,590
Made up with the best minds of the free world.

281
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,510
Our goal.

282
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,640
Is to create the best army in history.

283
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,350
But every army starts with one man.

284
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,600
Rogers! Get up from there.

285
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,640
At the end of this week, we will chose that man.

286
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,310
He'll be the first.

287
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,020
Our new breed of super soldiers.

288
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,490
Rogers, get your ass out of that line.

289
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,740
And they, will personally escort Adolph Hitler

290
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,280
Through the gates of hell.

291
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,450
Pick up the pace, ladies.

292
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,040
Let's go, let's go.

293
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,580
Double time.

294
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,040
Come on, faster, faster.

295
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,090
Move.

296
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
Move.

297
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,380
Squad halt.

298
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,140
That flag means you're only at the half way point.

299
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,800
First man to bring it to me,

300
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,720
gets to ride back with Agent Carter.

301
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,220
Move, move!

302
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,980
Come on, get up there.

303
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,400
That's what you got? This army is in trouble.

304
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,820
Get up there, Hodge.

305
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,980
Come on, get up there.

306
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,110
Nobody's got that flag in seventeen years.

307
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,830
Come on, come on, fall in.

308
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,160
Let's go, get back in a formation.

309
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,750
Rogers!

310
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,380
I said, fall in.

311
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,600
Thank you, Sir.

312
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,200
Faster ladies, come on.

313
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,090
My grandmother has more life in her,

314
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,950
God rest her soul. Move it!

315
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,000
You're not really thinking of picking Rogers, are you?

316
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
I am more than just thinking about it.

317
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,330
It is a clear choice.

318
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,500
When you brought a 90 pounds

319
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,960
modicum asthmatic onto my army base.

320
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,130
I let it slide. I thought what the hell.

321
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,840
Maybe he could be useful to you, like a gerbil.

322
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,970
- Never thought you'd pick him. - Up.

323
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,990
Stick a needle in that kids arm,

324
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,470
it's going to go right through him.

325
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,470
Come on, girls.

326
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,930
Look at that.

327
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,600
He's making me cry.

328
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,940
I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.

329
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,190
Do you know how long it took to set up this project.

330
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,980
- Yes. - All the groveling I had to do in front...

331
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,070
...of Senator whats-his-name committees.

332
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,110
Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.

333
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,200
Then throw me a bone.

334
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,360
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

335
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,660
He's big, he's fast.

336
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,330
He obeys orders, he's a soldier.

337
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,160
He's a bully.

338
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,750
You don't win wars with niceness, Doctor.

339
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,880
You win wars, with guts.

340
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,260
Grenade!

341
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,890
Stay away.

342
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,720
Get back.

343
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,900
Phony grenade.

344
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,190
All clear, back in formation.

345
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,320
Is this a test?

346
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,370
He's still skinny.

347
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,290
- May I? - Yeah.

348
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Can't sleep?

349
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,220
Got the jitters I guess.

350
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,010
Oh, me too.

351
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,560
Can I ask you a question?

352
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,970
Just one?

353
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Why me?

354
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,440
I suppose that is the one question that matters.

355
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,450
This is from Augsburg.

356
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,910
My City.

357
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,080
So many people forget that the

358
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,370
first country the Nazi's invaded was their own.

359
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,750
You know after the last war they,

360
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,000
my peoples struggled, they..They..

361
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,380
They felt weak, they felt..

362
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,800
...slow, then Hitler comes along.

363
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,470
With the marching and the big show, and the flags and all that

364
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,470
And he, hears of me.

365
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,760
My work, and he finds me.

366
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,060
Then he says, you.

367
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,230
He says, you will make us strong.

368
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,730
I am not interested.

369
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,940
So he sends the head of Hydra.

370
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,980
East research division.

371
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,200
A brilliant Scientist by the name of, Johann Schmidt.

372
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,620
Now Schmidt is a member of the inner circle.

373
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,410
And he's ambitious.

374
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,040
Even Hitler shares his passion for,

375
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,040
occult power and tatanic myth.

376
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,790
Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers.

377
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,090
But for Schmidt it is not fantasy.

378
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,960
For him, it is real.

379
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,010
He has become convinced that there is a great power.

380
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,470
Hidden in the earth.

381
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,510
Left here by the gods.

382
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,220
Waiting to be seized by superior men.

383
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,480
So when he has found my formula and what it can do.

384
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,890
He cannot resist.

385
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,730
Schmidt wants to become that superior man.

386
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,370
Did it make him stronger?

387
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,370
Ja.

388
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,200
But, it has other effects.

389
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,920
The serum wasn't ready.

390
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,040
But more important.

391
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,300
The man.

392
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,760
The serum amplifies everything that is inside, so..

393
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,840
Good becomes great.

394
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,510
Bad becomes worse.

395
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,980
This is why you were chosen.

396
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,820
Because a strong man who has known power all his life.

397
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,650
They lose respect for that power.

398
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,860
But a weak man.

399
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,450
Who values of strength.

400
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,200
And loves

401
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,030
Compassion.

402
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,620
Thanks. I think.

403
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,540
Give this.

404
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,550
Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing.

405
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,760
That you must stay who you are.

406
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,480
Not a perfect soldier.

407
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,140
But.

408
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,060
A good man.

409
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,940
To the little guys.

410
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,490
No, wait, wait. What am I doing?

411
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,120
No, you have procedure tomorrow.

412
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,080
No fluids.

413
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,450
All right, we'll drink it after.

414
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,710
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.

415
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,210
I can't after, I can now.

416
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,520
Is there something in particular you need?

417
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,320
I uh, understand you found him.

418
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,530
See for yourself.

419
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,420
You disapprove.

420
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,880
I just don't see why you need concern yourself.

421
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,130
I can't imagine he'll succeed.

422
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,140
Again.

423
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,800
The serum is the allies only defense.

424
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,600
against this power we now possess.

425
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,600
If we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.

426
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,110
Shall I give the order?

427
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,610
It has been given.

428
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Good.

429
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,580
Doctor Zola.

430
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,500
What do you think?

431
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,170
Masterpiece.

432
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,600
I know this neighborhood.

433
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,940
I got beat up in that alley.

434
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,570
And that parking lot.

435
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,940
And behind that dinner.

436
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,990
Did you have something against running away?

437
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
You start running they'll never let you stop.

438
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,410
You stand up, push back.

439
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,330
You can't say no forever, right.

440
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,670
I know a little of what that's like.

441
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,540
To have every door shut in your face.

442
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,380
I guess I just don't know why you would want to join the army.

443
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,220
You're a beautiful dame. Beautifu..Oh a woman. I mean...

444
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,220
An agent, not a Dame.

445
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,970
You are beautiful.

446
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,930
You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?

447
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,430
I think this is the longest conversation I've had with a woman.

448
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,830
They're not exactly lining

449
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,810
up to dance with a guy that might step on them.

450
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,270
You must have danced.

451
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,190
Well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying.

452
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,240
And the past few years just...

453
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,450
Didn't seem to matter that much.

454
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,820
Figured I'd wait.

455
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,120
For what?

456
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,120
Right partner.

457
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
This way.

458
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,810
What are we doing here?

459
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,430
Follow me.

460
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,200
Wonderful weather this morning. Isn't it.

461
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,990
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

462
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Good morning.

463
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,100
Please, not now.

464
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,100
You ready?

465
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,770
Good.

466
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,650
Take off your shirt your tie and your hat.

467
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,120
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

468
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,040
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

469
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,830
We needed access to the cities power grid.

470
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,910
Of course if you had given me a generalized requisition.

471
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,420
A lot of people are asking for funds, ....

472
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,790
Oh, this is Clem uh...

473
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,170
Gregg Clemson, state department.

474
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,130
If this project of yours comes through.

475
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,880
We'd like to see that it doesn't get into the headlines.

476
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,970
Jesus.

477
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,930
Somebody get that kid a sandwich.

478
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,860
Comfortable?

479
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,400
It's a little big.

480
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,910
You save me any of that schnapps?

481
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,540
Not as much as I should have.

482
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,080
Sorry, next time.

483
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,460
Mr. Stark.

484
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,710
How are your levels?

485
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,340
- Levels at 100%. - Good.

486
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,800
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn.

487
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,670
But we are ready.

488
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,800
Good as we'll ever be.

489
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,760
Agent Carter, don't you think

490
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,930
you would be more comfortable in the booth?

491
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,310
Oh yes, ah, sorry.

492
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,780
Can you hear me, is this on?

493
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,950
Ladies and Gentlemen.

494
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:02,030
Today we take not another step towards annihilation.

495
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,790
But the first step towards the path to peace.

496
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,500
We begin with a series of micro injections,

497
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,920
into the subjects major muscles.

498
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,760
The serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change.

499
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,300
Then to stimulate growth.

500
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,810
The subject will be saturated,

501
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,520
...with Vita rays

502
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,730
That wasn't so bad.

503
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,740
That was penicillin.

504
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,030
Serum infusion.

505
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,240
Beginning in, five...

506
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,660
Four...

507
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
Three...

508
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,290
Two...

509
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,090
One.

510
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,310
Now, Mr. Stark.

511
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,870
Steven.

512
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,500
Can you hear me?

513
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,420
Probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?

514
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,760
We will proceed.

515
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,100
That's ten percent.

516
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,190
Twenty percent.

517
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
Thirty.

518
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,740
That's forty percent.

519
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,070
All signs are normal.

520
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,280
That's fifty percent.

521
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,910
Sixty.

522
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
Seventy.

523
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,880
Steven, Steven.

524
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,250
- Shut it down! - Steven.

525
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,380
Shut it down.

526
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,010
Turn back, Mr. Stark. Turn it off kill it, turn back.

527
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,380
No!

528
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,510
Don't

529
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,260
I can do this.

530
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,900
Eighty...Ninety.

531
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,150
That's one hundred percent!

532
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,720
Mr. Stark.

533
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,190
Son of a bitch did it.

534
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,910
- I did it, - Yes, yes.

535
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,780
I think we did it.

536
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,950
You actually did it.

537
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,250
How do you feel?

538
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,250
Taller.

539
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,050
You look taller.

540
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,130
How do we look now, Senator?

541
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,720
I guess the folks in Berlin are about to get very nervous.

542
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,980
Congratulations.

543
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,230
Thank you, sir.

544
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,870
Stop him!

545
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,160
- They're coming, come on. - Now.

546
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,930
You all right? Hey!

547
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,310
This guy's been shot.

548
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,490
I had him.

549
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,990
Sorry.

550
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,510
I'm sorry.

551
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,960
No. No, darling no.

552
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,340
- Mommy. - No. Don't hurt him.

553
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,430
Go on.

554
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,760
Let me go.

555
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,310
No, don't hurt him.

556
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,690
Wait don't.

557
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,690
Don't.

558
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,450
No, don't.

559
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,290
Go get him, I can swim.

560
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,880
Who the hell are you?

561
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,220
The first of many.

562
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,510
Got off one head.

563
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,180
Two more shall take its place.

564
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,640
Heil Hydra.

565
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,090
He funds your research because you promised him weapons.

566
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,090
You serve at his pleasure.

567
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:18,300
He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries.

568
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,550
Reward, call it what it is, exile.

569
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,470
I no longer effect his image of Aryan perfection.

570
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,310
You think this is about appearances?

571
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,680
Your Hydra division has failed,

572
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,310
...to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year.

573
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,690
And we have learned through local intelligence.

574
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,860
You have mounted a full scaled incursion into Norway.

575
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,740
The Red Skull has been indulged long enough.

576
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,500
Gentlemen.

577
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,930
You have come to see the results of our work, hmm?

578
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,340
Let me show you.

579
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,350
Hitler speaks of a thousand year Reich.

580
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,060
But he cannot feed his armies for a month is truth.

581
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,850
His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe.

582
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,070
But still he is no closer to achieving his goals.

583
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:21,570
And I suppose you still aim to win this war through magic.

584
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,870
Science, but I understand your confusion.

585
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,080
Great power has always baffled primitive men.

586
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,000
Hydra is assembling an arsenal

587
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,620
that will destroy my enemies in one stroke.

588
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,710
Wherever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess.

589
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,170
All in a matter of hours.

590
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,670
Your enemies?

591
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,340
My weapons contain enough destructive power,

592
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,470
...to decimate every hostile capital on Earth.

593
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,180
Quite simply, gentlemen.

594
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,640
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

595
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:56,110
Thank you, Schmidt.

596
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,230
For what?

597
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,280
For making it clear how obviously mad you are.

598
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,190
Berlin is on this map!

599
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,070
So it is.

600
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,870
You will be punished for your insolence.

601
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,810
My apologies, Doctor.

602
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:34,890
But we both knew Hydra could grow no further in Hitler's shadow.

603
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,770
Heil Hydra.

604
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,730
Heil Hydra!

605
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,780
Heil Hydra.

606
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,080
Think you got enough?

607
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,370
Any hope of reproducing

608
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,800
the program is locked in your genetic code

609
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,010
But without Erskine it would take years.

610
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,180
He deserved more than this.

611
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,560
If it could work only once.

612
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,980
He'd be proud of you.

613
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,270
Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.

614
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,900
Great, why don't we start with how a German spy,

615
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,610
..Got a ride to my secret installation in your car?

616
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:28,610
What do we got here?

617
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,170
Speaking modestly I'm the

618
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,120
best mechanical engineer in this country.

619
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,250
But I don't know what's inside this thing.

620
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,250
Or how it works.

621
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,250
We're not even close to this technology.

622
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,250
Then who is?

623
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,210
Hydra, I'm sure you've been reading our briefings.

624
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,550
I'm on a number of committees, Colonel.

625
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,840
Hydra is a Nazi Deep science division.

626
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,380
It's led by Johann Schmidt.

627
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,130
But he has much bigger ambitions.

628
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,620
Hydra's practically a cult,

629
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,930
they worship Schmidt, they think he's invincible.

630
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,180
So what are you going to do about it?

631
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,640
I spoke to the President this morning.

632
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,400
As of today, the S.S.R. is being retasked.

633
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,560
- Colonel? - We are taking the fight to Hydra.

634
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,400
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

635
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,480
You too, Stark.

636
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,490
We're flying to London tonight.

637
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,740
Sir.

638
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,530
If you're going after Schmidt, I want in.

639
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,320
Your an experiment, you're going to Alamogordo.

640
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:13,080
The serum worked.

641
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,330
I asked for an army, and all I got was you.

642
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,700
You.

643
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,290
You're not enough.

644
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,040
With all due respect to the Colonel.

645
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,050
I think we may be missing the point.

646
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,170
I've seen you in action, Steve.

647
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,930
More importantly.

648
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,180
The countries seen it.

649
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,180
Paper.

650
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,400
The enlistment lines have been

651
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,770
around the block since your picture hit the news stands.

652
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,350
You don't take a soldier, a symbol like that.

653
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,610
And hide him in a Lab.

654
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,060
Son.

655
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,480
You want to serve your country.

656
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:50,400
On the most important battlefield of the war.

657
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,410
Sir.

658
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,870
That's all I want.

659
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,660
Then congratulations.

660
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,700
You just got promoted.

661
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,870
I don't know if I can do this.

662
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,000
Nothing to it.

663
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Sell a few bonds, bonds buy's bullets.

664
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,670
Bullets kill Nazi's, bing, bang, boom.

665
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,340
You're an American hero.

666
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,630
It's just I don't think I'm getting there.

667
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:13,680
The senator's got a lot of pull up on the hill.

668
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,050
You play ball, with us.

669
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:16,890
You'll be leading your own platoon in no time.

670
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,390
That's you.

671
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,020
Go!

672
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,820
Who's strong and brave, here to save the American way.

673
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:30,070
Not all of us can storm a beach.

674
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:31,200
Or drive a tank.

675
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,240
But there's still a way all of us can fight.

676
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,700
Who loves to fight like the man for what right by day.

677
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:39,830
Series E Defense bonds.

678
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:43,370
Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guys gun.

679
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:46,710
Who built and came door to door for America?

680
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,460
Carries the flag shore to shore for America.

681
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,590
From Hoboken to Spokane.

682
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:59,850
The Star Spangled Man, with the plan.

683
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,020
Cut.

684
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:04,940
All right, don't look at the camera.

685
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,360
We can't ignore there's a threat and the warning is big.

686
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,900
Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guys gun.

687
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:17,530
Who'll hang the noose on the goose that we loosed from Berlin.

688
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:22,160
Who will redeem heed the call for America.

689
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,710
Who buys it all, gives his all for America.

690
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,130
Who stands to prove that task.

691
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:35,050
The Star Spangled Man, with the plan.

692
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,760
We all know it's about trying to win the war.

693
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,850
We can't do that without bullets and bandages.

694
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,100
Tanks and casts.

695
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,270
And that's where you come in.

696
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,190
Every bond you buy will help protect someone you love.

697
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:47,980
Look out there, he's there behind you.

698
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,400
The Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us.

699
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:58,990
Stalwart, and steady and true.

700
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,360
See how this guy can shoot!

701
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,290
We can tell that there's no substitute.

702
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:08,170
Forceful and ready to defend the Red, White and Blue!

703
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:12,880
Who'll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox?

704
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,760
Far as an eagle we'll soar.

705
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,260
Who's making Adolph afraid to step out of his bunk?

706
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:23,140
He knows what we're fighting for.

707
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,980
Who waked the giant that napped in America?

708
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,610
We know it's no one but, Captain America.

709
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:33,070
Who'll finish what they began?

710
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:36,400
Who'll kick the krauts to Japan?

711
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,320
The Star Spangled Man.

712
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,830
With the...

713
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:49,580
Plaaaaaaaaaan.

714
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,010
How many of you are ready to help me sock ol' Adolph on the jaw?

715
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,220
Okay.

716
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,190
I need a volunteer.

717
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,860
We already volunteered, how do you think I got here?

718
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,690
Bring back the girls.

719
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,360
I think they only know the one song.

720
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,370
But, um...

721
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,910
Let me...I'll see what I can do.

722
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,330
You do that, sweetheart.

723
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,210
Nice boots, Tinkerbell.

724
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:30,830
Come on guys.

725
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,590
We're all on the same team here.

726
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,710
Hey, Captain.

727
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,920
Sign this.

728
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,190
Don't worry about it, they'll warm up to you. Don't worry.

729
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,780
Hello Steve.

730
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,660
What are you doing here?

731
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:11,870
Officially I'm not here at all.

732
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,080
That was quite a performance.

733
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,500
Yeah, uh...

734
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,840
I had to improvise a little bit.

735
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,340
The crowds I'm used to are usually are, uh...

736
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,310
- twelve. - I understand you're America's new hope.

737
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:29,140
Bond sales take a ten percent bump on every state I visit.

738
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,560
That's Senator Brandt's idea.

739
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:33,730
At least he's got me doing this.

740
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:36,360
Phillips would have had me stuck in a lab.

741
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,110
And these are you only two options?

742
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,110
A lab rat or a dancing monkey.

743
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:43,910
You were meant for more than this, you know.

744
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,580
What?

745
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,960
You know, for the longest time I dreamed about,

746
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,550
...coming over seas and...

747
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,090
..Being on the front lines.

748
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,380
Serving my country.

749
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,930
Finally got everything I wanted.

750
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:09,310
And I'm wearing tights.

751
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:18,980
Look like they've been through hell.

752
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,690
These men move the most.

753
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,660
Schmidt sent out a force to a zone.

754
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,240
200 men went up against him.

755
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,410
Less than 50 returned.

756
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,420
Your audience contained what was left of the 107th.

757
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,920
The rest were killed or captured.

758
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,590
The 107th?

759
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,260
What?

760
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:43,590
Come on.

761
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:45,930
Colonel Phillips.

762
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,550
Well, if it isn't the Star Spangled Man with the plan.

763
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,140
What is your plan today?

764
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,680
I need the causality list from Bolzano.

765
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,100
You don't get to give me orders, son.

766
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,980
I just need one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

767
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,440
You and I are going to have a conversation later that you won't enjoy.

768
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,190
Please tell me he's alive, sir. B-A-R...

769
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,190
I can spell.

770
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,640
I've signed more of these

771
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,290
condolence letters today than I would care to count.

772
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,160
But...

773
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,540
The name does sound familiar.

774
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:16,000
I'm sorry.

775
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,130
What about the others?

776
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,920
Are you planning a rescue mission?

777
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,340
Yeah, it's called winning the war.

778
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,430
But if you know where they are, why not...

779
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,680
They're thirty miles behind the lines.

780
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:32,100
Through some of the most heavily fortified territory in Europe.

781
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,850
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

782
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,180
I don't expect you to understand that,

783
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,600
because you're a chorus girl.

784
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,060
I think I understand just fine.

785
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,940
Well then understand it somewhere else.

786
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,480
If I read the posters correctly,

787
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,110
you've got someplace to be in thirty minutes.

788
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,580
Yes, sir.

789
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,200
I do.

790
00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:59,410
If you have something to say,

791
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:01,380
right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

792
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,630
What do plan to do, walk to Austria.

793
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:09,760
If that's what it takes.

794
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:12,300
You heard the Colonel, your friend is most likely dead.

795
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,470
You don't know that.

796
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:16,060
Even so, he's devising a strategy, it takes time.

797
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,690
By the time he's done that, it could be too late.

798
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:19,400
Steve.

799
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,570
You told me you thought I was meant for more than this.

800
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,240
Did you mean that?

801
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,530
Every word.

802
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,000
Then you gotta let me go.

803
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,420
I can do more than that.

804
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:42,880
On stage, girls.

805
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,050
Where's my helmet?

806
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,760
Anyone seen Rogers?

807
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:54,930
The Hydra camp is in Krossberg.

808
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,930
It's up between these two mountain ranges.

809
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:58,100
It's a factory of some kind.

810
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,270
We should be able to drop you around the doorstep.

811
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:01,770
Just get me as close as you can.

812
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:02,870
You know you two are going

813
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,230
to be in a lot of trouble when you land.

814
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,030
- And you won't. - Where I'm going if any anybody,

815
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,610
...yells at me I can just shoot them.

816
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:09,150
And they will undoubtedly shoot back.

817
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,320
Well lets hope this is good for something.

818
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,530
Agent Carter.

819
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:13,910
If you're not in too much of a hurry I thought

820
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,870
we could stop off in Usurea for a late night Fondue.

821
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,500
Stark is the best civilian pilot I've ever seen.

822
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,260
He's mad enough to brave this air space. We're lucky to have him.

823
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,050
So you two?

824
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,050
Do you?

825
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,220
Fondue?

826
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,720
This is your transponder, active it when you're ready.

827
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,680
And the signal will lead us straight to you.

828
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,480
Are you sure this thing works?

829
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,020
It tested more than you, pal.

830
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,110
Get back here, we're taking you all the way there.

831
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,090
I'm jumping this plane,

832
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,200
turn this thing around and get the hell out of here.

833
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,870
You can't give me orders.

834
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,620
The hell I can't.

835
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:04,080
I'm a Captain.

836
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,690
As you can see.

837
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,520
Production of Valkyrie is progressing on schedule.

838
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:28,650
Even with components of this size.

839
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,440
Increase the output by sixty percent.

840
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,950
And speak with our other facilities to do the same.

841
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,870
But these prisoners, I'm not sure they have the strength.

842
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,000
Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor.

843
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,290
There are always more workers.

844
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,920
Not now.

845
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,860
You know, Fritz.

846
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,610
One of these days I'm going to have a stick of my own.

847
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,640
Fellas.

848
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,810
Who are you suppose to be?

849
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,270
Captain America.

850
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,520
I, beg your pardon?

851
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,110
What are we taking, everybody?

852
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,450
I'm from Fresno, ace.

853
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,530
There anybody else?

854
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:05,320
I'm looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.

855
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,120
There's an isolation ward in the factory.

856
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,290
No one's ever come back from it.

857
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:09,330
All right.

858
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,040
The tree line is northwest, it's eighty yards past the gate.

859
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,500
Get out fast, and give them hell.

860
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,130
I'll meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find.

861
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,210
Wait. You know what you're doing?

862
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:21,090
Yeah. I knocked out Adolph Hitler over 200 times.

863
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,410
You know how to use that thing?

864
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,660
Okay.

865
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,670
What is happening?

866
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:07,760
Not exactly a Buick.

867
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,890
Get going, Dum Dum.

868
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:13,980
I didn't know you spoke German.

869
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,540
I recently mastered at Le Havre.

870
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,150
Plus the French girls much cuter.

871
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,650
That's the resume.

872
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:52,060
No, no, what are you doing?

873
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,850
Our forces are out matched.

874
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,040
Keep moving.

875
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,380
Grab a grenade.

876
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:08,260
Bucky.

877
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,800
Oh my God.

878
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,430
It's me, it's Steve.

879
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:19,810
Steve.

880
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:21,060
- Come on. - Steve.

881
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:26,320
I thought you were dead.

882
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:28,650
I thought you were smaller?

883
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:37,700
Come on.

884
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,330
What happened to you?

885
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:42,460
I joined the army.

886
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:50,220
Did it hurt?

887
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,220
A little.

888
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,180
- Permanent? - So far.

889
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:25,750
Captain America.

890
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,460
How exciting.

891
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,130
I am a great fan of your films.

892
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:36,890
So Doctor Erskine managed it after all.

893
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:41,270
Not exactly an improvement, but, still.

894
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,520
Impressive.

895
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,020
You've got no idea.

896
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,030
Haven't I.

897
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,920
No matter what lies Erskine told you.

898
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,670
You see I was his greatest success.

899
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,480
You don't have one of those, do you?

900
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:30,730
You are deluded, Captain.

901
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,280
You pretend to be a simple soldier.

902
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,280
But in reality you are just afraid to admit,

903
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,910
...that we have left humanity behind.

904
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:43,750
Men like you.

905
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,620
They embrace it proudly.

906
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:47,830
No fear.

907
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:48,960
Then how come you're running?

908
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,470
Come on, let's go.

909
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:08,350
Sir, we go to the roof?

910
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,110
What about me?

911
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,030
Where will I sit?

912
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:17,700
Not a scratch, Doctor.

913
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,240
Not a scratch.

914
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,860
Let's go. One at a time.

915
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,350
Gotta get a rope or something.

916
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,140
Just go, get out of here.

917
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:27,640
No, not without you.

918
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,460
Senator brandt, I regret to inform you,

919
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:55,880
Captain Stephen G. Rogers

920
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,300
went missing behind enemy lines,

921
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:02,970
on the third area. Reconnaissance has proven unfruitful as a result,

922
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:05,720
...I must declare Captain Rogers,

923
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,640
...killed in action. Period.

924
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,230
The last surveillance flight is back.

925
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:18,360
No sign of activity.

926
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,450
Go get a cup of coffee, corporal.

927
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:27,080
We can't touch Stark, he's rich.

928
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:29,870
And he's the army's number one weapons contractor.

929
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:31,500
- You are neither one. - With respect, sir.

930
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,960
I don't regret my actions.

931
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,290
And I don't think Captain Rogers did, either.

932
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:37,670
What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions.

933
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,760
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

934
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,150
And now America's golden boy,

935
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:42,930
and a lot of other good men are dead.

936
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,930
'Cause you had a crush.

937
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:45,930
It wasn't that.

938
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,300
I had faith.

939
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,640
Well I hope that's a big comfort to you,

940
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,270
...when they shut this division down.

941
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:53,940
There they are, I can't believe it.

942
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,190
What the hell's going on out there?

943
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,640
Some of these men need medical attention.

944
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,680
Medic, I got wounded.

945
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,600
I'd like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.

946
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:17,480
That won't be necessary.

947
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:22,730
Yes, Sir.

948
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,440
Faith, huh?

949
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,240
You're late.

950
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:39,120
Couldn't call my ride.

951
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:45,340
Let's hear it for, Captain America.

952
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:03,520
I am honored to present,

953
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,980
...this medal for valor.

954
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:06,860
To my personal friend.

955
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,490
Captain America.

956
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,830
Captain America?

957
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,290
Captain, that's your cue.

958
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,540
I thought he'd be taller.

959
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:37,850
This one here in Poland, and the Baltic.

960
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:39,770
and the sixth one was...

961
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,480
about...

962
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,650
...here. 30, 40 miles west of the maginal line.

963
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,490
I just got a quick look.

964
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,320
Well nobody's perfect.

965
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:56,790
These are the weapon factories we know about.

966
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:59,070
Sergeant Barnes said that

967
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:01,290
Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility,

968
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:02,290
...that isn't on this map.

969
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,080
Agent Carter co-ordinate with MI6.

970
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,050
I want every allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.

971
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,050
What about us?

972
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,630
We are going to set a fire under Johann Schmidt's ass.

973
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,050
What do say, Rogers?

974
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,890
It's your map. You think you can wipe Hydra off of it?

975
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:15,890
Yes, Sir.

976
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,180
I'll need a team.

977
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,140
We're already putting together the best men.

978
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:20,810
With all due respect, Sir.

979
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:22,520
So am I.

980
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:25,190
So let's get this straight.

981
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:27,440
We barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?

982
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:29,900
Pretty much.

983
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:32,950
Sounds rather, fun actually.

984
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:35,280
I'm in.

985
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,460
We're in.

986
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:51,720
Hell, I'll always play.

987
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,630
But you gotta do one thing for me.

988
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:54,640
What's that?

989
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,930
Open a tab.

990
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,690
Well that was easy.

991
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,060
Another round.

992
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,900
Where are they putting all this stuff?

993
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:12,070
See, told you.

994
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:14,070
They are all idiots.

995
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,240
What about you?

996
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:20,660
You ready to follow Captain America into the jowls of death?

997
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,660
Hell, no.

998
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,460
That little guy from Brooklyn. I was too.

999
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,210
Don't like to run away from a fight.

1000
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:28,920
I'm following him.

1001
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,630
Hey, you keeping your outfit, right?

1002
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:37,930
You know what?

1003
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:40,600
It's kinda growing on me.

1004
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:44,440
And remember that the best of friends must part, must part

1005
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,810
Adieu, adieu...

1006
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,740
- Captain. - Agent Carter.

1007
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,200
Ma'am.

1008
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,030
Howard has some equipment for you to try.

1009
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:01,290
- Tomorrow morning. - Sounds good.

1010
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,630
I see your top squad is prepping for duty.

1011
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:10,710
You don't like music?

1012
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:12,130
I do, actually.

1013
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,880
I might even, when this is all over,

1014
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,970
...go dancing.

1015
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:18,470
Then what are we waiting for?

1016
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:21,260
The right partner.

1017
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,140
Pay attention, Captain.

1018
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,230
Yes, Ma'am.

1019
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,230
I'll be there.

1020
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:28,940
I'm invisible.

1021
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,270
I'm turning into you.

1022
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,610
It's a horrible dream.

1023
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,360
Don't take it so hard.

1024
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,030
Maybe she's got a friend.

1025
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,620
Initial signature is unusual.

1026
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,830
Alpha beta remain neutral.

1027
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,750
No doubt Rogers picked up on that.

1028
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,380
Seems harmless enough.

1029
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,590
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

1030
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:04,220
Write that down.

1031
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:08,020
Excuse me. I'm looking for a Mr. Stark.

1032
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:10,560
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

1033
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:18,610
Oh, of course you're welcome to wait.

1034
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,620
I uh,

1035
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:27,250
Read about what you did.

1036
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:29,580
Oh, that...yeah.

1037
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,670
Well that's, you know...

1038
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,880
Just doing what needed to be done.

1039
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,380
Sounded like more than that.

1040
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:38,050
You saved nearly 400 men.

1041
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:46,270
Really, it's not a big deal.

1042
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,140
Tell that to their wives.

1043
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,360
Uh, I don't think they were all married.

1044
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,520
You're a hero.

1045
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:57,230
Well, that...you know.

1046
01:16:57,230 --> 01:16:58,900
Tha..That depends on the definition of...

1047
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,280
And the Women of America.

1048
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,910
They owe you their thanks.

1049
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,200
And um, seeing as they're not here.

1050
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Captain!

1051
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,630
We're ready for you. If you're not otherwise occupied.

1052
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,260
Agent Carter, wait.

1053
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:23,640
Looks like finding a partner wasn't that hard after all.

1054
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,430
Hey, that's not what you thought it was.

1055
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:27,890
I don't think anything, Captain. Not one thing.

1056
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,430
Always wanted to be a soldier, and now you are.

1057
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:31,690
Just like all the rest.

1058
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:33,480
Well what about you and Stark?

1059
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,110
How do I know you two haven't been...

1060
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:36,360
...fondueing.

1061
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,530
You still don't know a bloody thing about women.

1062
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:46,910
Fondue's just cheese and bread, my friend.

1063
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:47,910
Really?

1064
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:48,470
I didn't think...

1065
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:49,370
Or should you, pal.

1066
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:51,250
The moment you think you know what's going on in...

1067
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:52,220
a woman's head. Is the

1068
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:54,040
moment your goose is well and truly cooked.

1069
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:55,840
Me, I concentrate on work.

1070
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,270
Which at the moment, is about

1071
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:59,590
making sure you and your men do not get killed.

1072
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,510
Carbon polymer.

1073
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:04,800
Should withstand your average German bayonet.

1074
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:08,350
Although, Hydra's not going to attack you with a pocket knife.

1075
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,640
I hear you're uh, kinda attached.

1076
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,270
It's handier than you might think.

1077
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:15,310
I took the liberty of coming up with some options.

1078
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:17,400
This one's fun.

1079
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,030
She's being fitted with electrical relays.

1080
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:21,440
- That will allow you to.. - What about this one?

1081
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,440
No, no that's just a prototype.

1082
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,450
What's it made of?

1083
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,820
Vibranium.

1084
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,620
It's stronger than steel, and a third of the weight.

1085
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:31,540
It's completely vibration absorbent.

1086
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:34,960
How come it's not standard issue?

1087
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,630
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

1088
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:37,710
What you're holding there.

1089
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:38,750
That's all we got.

1090
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:40,050
Are you quite finished, Mr. Stark?

1091
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:42,800
I'm sure the Captain has some unfinished business.

1092
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:43,800
What do you think?

1093
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,190
Yes, I think it works.

1094
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,320
I had some ideas about the uniform.

1095
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:09,330
Whatever you want, pal.

1096
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:16,490
You are failing!

1097
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:21,080
We are close to an offensive that will shake the planet.

1098
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,130
And we are continually delayed because,

1099
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:25,750
...you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield.

1100
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:27,710
It's hardly my area of expertise.

1101
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:30,340
I, I merely develop weapons.

1102
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:31,970
I..I..I cannot fire them.

1103
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:34,230
Finish your mission, Doctor.

1104
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:36,510
Before the American finishes his.

1105
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:37,810
Sir!

1106
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,600
I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.

1107
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:44,400
We fought to the last man.

1108
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:49,650
Evidently not.

1109
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:04,670
Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone on Coney Island?

1110
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,670
Yeah, and I threw up.

1111
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,590
This isn't pay back, is it?

1112
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:11,050
Why would I do that?

1113
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:13,970
You were right, Doctor Zola is on the train.

1114
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:17,260
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle.

1115
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:20,060
Wherever he's going, they must need him bad.

1116
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,690
Let's get going because they're moving like the devil.

1117
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,940
We only got about a ten second window.

1118
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,200
You miss that, window.

1119
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,860
We're bugs on a windshield.

1120
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:36,120
Mind the gap.

1121
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,530
Gotta get moving, buds.

1122
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:47,140
Stop him.

1123
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:48,600
Fire again.

1124
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:42,240
I had him on the ropes.

1125
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:43,240
I know you did.

1126
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:45,200
Get down!

1127
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:48,660
Fire again.

1128
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,830
Kill him, now.

1129
01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:59,380
Bucky!

1130
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:04,470
Hang on.

1131
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,680
Grab my hand.

1132
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:09,440
No!

1133
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,040
Sit down.

1134
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,840
What is this?

1135
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:22,680
Steak.

1136
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:25,510
What is in it?

1137
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:27,140
Cow.

1138
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,230
Doctor, do you realize,

1139
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:34,400
...how difficult it is to get a hold,

1140
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,270
...of a prime cut like that out here?

1141
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,650
I don't eat meat.

1142
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:43,360
- Why not? - It disagrees with me.

1143
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,530
How about Cyanide, does that give you the rumbly tummy too?

1144
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:52,910
Every Hydra agent that we've tried to take alive,

1145
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:55,420
...consumed a little pill before we can stop them.

1146
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,080
But not you.

1147
01:26:58,090 --> 01:27:01,050
So, here's my brilliant theory.

1148
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:04,380
You want to live.

1149
01:27:05,890 --> 01:27:08,180
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1150
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,140
I brought you dinner.

1151
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:19,150
Given the valuable information that he has provided,

1152
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,570
And in exchange for his full co-operation.

1153
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:26,530
Doctor Zola is being remanded to Switzerland.

1154
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:28,530
I sent that message to Washington this morning.

1155
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,580
Of course it was encoded.

1156
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:33,040
You guys haven't broken those codes, have you?

1157
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:34,870
That would be awkward.

1158
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:36,830
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1159
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:38,130
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.

1160
01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:40,380
You're a liability.

1161
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,670
You know more about Schmidt than anyone.

1162
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:43,960
And...

1163
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,100
And the last guy you cost us

1164
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:48,260
was Captain Rogers closest friend.

1165
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:50,800
So I wouldn't count on the very best of protection.

1166
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,310
It's you,

1167
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,730
...or Schmidt.

1168
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:57,230
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

1169
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:03,360
Schmidt believes he walks in the footsteps of the gods.

1170
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:07,860
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1171
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:09,820
You do realize that's nuts, don't you.

1172
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,240
Of course.

1173
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:14,370
The sanity of the plan is of no consequence.

1174
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:16,710
- And why is that? - Because he can do it.

1175
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:18,620
What's his target?

1176
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:22,460
His target,

1177
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:25,510
is everywhere.

1178
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:47,110
Tomorrow...

1179
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:51,070
Hydra will stand master of the world.

1180
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:55,330
Born to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie.

1181
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:59,750
Our enemies weapons will be powerless against us.

1182
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,290
If they shoot down one plane.

1183
01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:05,130
Hundreds more will rain fire upon them.

1184
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,840
If they cut off one head.

1185
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:15,260
Two more shall take its place.

1186
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,430
Heil Hydra.

1187
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:18,930
Heil Hydra!

1188
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:20,520
Heil Hydra!

1189
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,610
Heil Hydra...Heil Hydra!

1190
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:26,440
Heil Hydra, Heil Hydra!

1191
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,110
Heil Hydra.

1192
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:57,890
Doctor Erskine said that,

1193
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,810
...the serum wouldn't just affect my muscles.

1194
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:02,560
It would affect my cells.

1195
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:06,230
Create a protective system,

1196
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:08,070
...Of regeneration and healing.

1197
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:09,240
Which means, um...

1198
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,360
I can't get drunk.

1199
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,580
Did you know that?

1200
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:21,160
Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person.

1201
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,040
He thought it could be one of the side effects.

1202
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:32,010
It wasn't your fault.

1203
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,090
Did you read the report?

1204
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:36,100
Yes.

1205
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,010
Well, then you know that's not true.

1206
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:39,430
You did everything you could.

1207
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,730
Did you believe in your friend?

1208
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,980
Did you respect him?

1209
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,980
Then stop blaming yourself.

1210
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:52,570
And that was the dignity of his choice.

1211
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:55,070
He damn well must have thought you were worth it.

1212
01:30:57,530 --> 01:30:59,080
I'm going after Schmidt.

1213
01:31:00,490 --> 01:31:02,350
I'm not going to stop

1214
01:31:02,350 --> 01:31:03,750
'til all of Hydra is dead, or captured.

1215
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,250
You won't be alone.

1216
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:12,300
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bug house.

1217
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,510
He thinks he's a god and he's

1218
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,430
willing to blow up half the world to prove it.

1219
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:17,180
Starting with the U.S.A.

1220
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:19,600
Schmidt's working with powers beyond our capabilities.

1221
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,640
He gets across the Atlantic.

1222
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:25,100
He'll wipe out the entire eastern seaboard in an hour.

1223
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,270
How much time we got?

1224
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:32,990
According to my new best friend, in twenty four hours.

1225
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,280
Where is he now?

1226
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,070
Hydra's last base is here.

1227
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:37,910
In the Alps.

1228
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:39,780
500 feet below the surface.

1229
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,750
So what are we suppose to do?

1230
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,250
It's not like we can just knock on the front door.

1231
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:47,960
Why not?

1232
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:55,010
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1233
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:05,550
Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait.

1234
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:08,020
But I must say you do it better than anyone.

1235
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,260
But, there are limits,

1236
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:15,860
to what even you can do, Captain.

1237
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:19,780
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1238
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:21,490
He told me you were insane.

1239
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:27,870
He resented my genius,

1240
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:31,330
and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine.

1241
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:33,620
But he gave you everything.

1242
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:36,540
So.

1243
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:41,010
What made you so special?

1244
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:45,260
Nothing.

1245
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:48,560
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1246
01:34:59,730 --> 01:35:01,490
I can do this all day.

1247
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:03,700
Oh of course you can, of course.

1248
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:06,870
But unfortunately I am on a tight schedule.

1249
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:14,120
So am I.

1250
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:27,470
Rogers.

1251
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:29,560
You might need this.

1252
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,560
Thanks.

1253
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:44,610
We're in, assaulting now!

1254
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:45,610
Move out!

1255
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:38,290
Got off one head, two more...

1256
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:41,380
Let's go find two more.

1257
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:06,320
Cease fire.

1258
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:09,450
You're late.

1259
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,660
Weren't you about to...

1260
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:14,830
Right.

1261
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:29,570
Get in.

1262
01:38:58,680 --> 01:38:59,720
Keep it steady.

1263
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:00,770
Wait!

1264
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,520
Go get him.

1265
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:10,030
I'm not kissing you.

1266
01:42:49,950 --> 01:42:51,750
You don't give up, do you?

1267
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:53,210
Nope.

1268
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:04,450
You could have the power of the gods.

1269
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,120
Yet you wear a flag on your

1270
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:10,030
chest and think you fight a battle of nations.

1271
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:13,370
I have seen the future, Captain.

1272
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:16,420
- There are no flags. - Not my future.

1273
01:44:30,510 --> 01:44:31,970
What have you done?

1274
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:33,310
No!

1275
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,250
Come in this is, Captain Rogers. Do you read me?

1276
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,590
Captain Rogers, what is your...

1277
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:46,960
Steve is that you, are you all right?

1278
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,720
Great, Schmidt's dead.

1279
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:50,630
What about the plane?

1280
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:54,220
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1281
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:57,100
Give me your coordinates I'll find you a safe landing site.

1282
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:00,060
There's not going to be a safe landing.

1283
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,150
I'm going to try and force it down.

1284
01:46:02,150 --> 01:46:04,360
I'll get Howard on the line, he'll know what to do.

1285
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:05,360
There's not enough time.

1286
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:07,900
This thing's moving too fast and it's heading for New York.

1287
01:46:12,570 --> 01:46:14,120
I gotta put her in the water.

1288
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:15,740
Please, don't do this.

1289
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:17,790
We have time, we can work it out.

1290
01:46:17,790 --> 01:46:19,210
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.

1291
01:46:19,210 --> 01:46:21,170
If I wait any longer a lot of people are going to die.

1292
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:27,920
Peggy.

1293
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,220
This is my choice.

1294
01:46:55,570 --> 01:46:56,580
Peggy.

1295
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:58,700
I'm here.

1296
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:03,870
I'm going to need a rain check on that dance.

1297
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,840
All right.

1298
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:19,770
A week next Saturday at the Stork Club.

1299
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,100
You got it.

1300
01:47:24,230 --> 01:47:25,350
Eight o'clock, on the dot.

1301
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:26,730
Don't you dare be late.

1302
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:28,860
Understood?

1303
01:47:30,730 --> 01:47:32,280
You know I still don't know how to dance.

1304
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:40,120
I'll show you how.

1305
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:41,700
Just be there.

1306
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:45,080
We'll have the band play something slow.

1307
01:47:48,790 --> 01:47:50,420
I'd hate to step on your....

1308
01:47:53,470 --> 01:47:54,470
Steve?

1309
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,010
Steve.

1310
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:02,730
Steve.

1311
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:02,790
To the Captain.

1312
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:16,590
Sir.

1313
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:28,310
Take us to the next grid point.

1314
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:30,400
But there's no trace of wreckage.

1315
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:33,650
And the energy signal trace stops here.

1316
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:37,070
Just keep looking.

1317
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:46,510
There's a pitch, it's a ball high outside.

1318
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:51,190
So, the dodges tied four to four.

1319
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:55,690
At the count no doubt, one swing of his bat.

1320
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:58,400
This fella is capable of making it a brand new game again

1321
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:02,700
Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets field.

1322
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:06,370
Phillies have managed to tie it up four to four.

1323
01:51:07,790 --> 01:51:10,080
But the Dodgers have three men on.

1324
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:16,170
Pitch, it's a strike.

1325
01:51:21,470 --> 01:51:25,470
He leans in, here's the pitch, swung on, it's a line drive.

1326
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:27,010
It gets past Grissom.

1327
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:31,480
Rizzo will score, Reiser heads to third.

1328
01:51:31,850 --> 01:51:33,560
Durocher is going to wave him in.

1329
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:36,900
They look to relay but they hold steady.

1330
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:38,890
Pete Reiser with an inside the park...

1331
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:39,480
Good Morning.

1332
01:51:41,570 --> 01:51:42,780
Or should I say, afternoon.

1333
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:44,410
Oh my god.

1334
01:51:44,490 --> 01:51:45,530
Where am I?

1335
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:48,030
You're in a recovery room in New York city.

1336
01:51:50,290 --> 01:51:55,710
The Dodgers take the lead, it's eight to four Oh ho, dodgers!

1337
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,090
What a game we have here today, folks.

1338
01:51:58,090 --> 01:51:59,250
Fine game indeed.

1339
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:00,630
Where am I really?

1340
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:03,590
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1341
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:05,760
The game.

1342
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:07,800
It's for May, 1941.

1343
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:08,970
I know, 'cause I was there.

1344
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:14,810
Now I'm going to ask you again.

1345
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:17,020
Where am I?

1346
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:19,480
- Captain Rogers - Who are you?

1347
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:28,200
Captain Rogers, wait.

1348
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:32,290
All agents, code 13.

1349
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,210
...13, all agents code 13.

1350
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:57,650
At ease, soldier.

1351
01:53:06,450 --> 01:53:09,450
Look I'm sorry about that little show back there, but.

1352
01:53:10,570 --> 01:53:13,160
We thought it best to break it to you slowly.

1353
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:14,830
Break what?

1354
01:53:17,410 --> 01:53:18,920
You've been asleep, Cap.

1355
01:53:19,630 --> 01:53:21,290
For almost seventy years.

1356
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:37,690
You gonna be okay?

1357
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:39,770
Yeah.

1358
01:53:39,770 --> 01:53:41,480
Yeah, just...

1359
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:45,860
I had a date.

1360
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:08,460
Trouble sleeping?

1361
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:13,360
You're here with the mission, sir?

1362
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:14,860
I am.

1363
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,860
Try to get me back to the world.

1364
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:20,060
Try to save it.

1365
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:31,060
You think you're the only hero in the world?

1366
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:47,660
Gentlemen, you are up.

1367
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:55,660
A little bit swing.
