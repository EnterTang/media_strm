1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,200
This programme contains some strong
language and some scenes of a sexual nature.

2
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:13,717
My name's George...

3
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:15,200
and I'm a werewolf.

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,880
Everything that Owen and
I ever had can go to ash.

5
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:29,257
Bitch!

6
00:00:29,292 --> 00:00:30,600
Aaargh!

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,685
We've got to eat.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,840
I can't do this. Make your mind up time.

9
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,005
I choose them.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,080
This land is ours and we have
all the time in the world.

11
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:45,080
I am the weapon.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,360
Do it!

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,680
It's over. Are we safe now?

14
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:53,497
Professor Jaggat...

15
00:00:53,532 --> 00:00:55,280
We've found them.

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,320
So I followed her into the
kitchen and I said to her,

17
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,797
"Nina, please tell me what's wrong. "

18
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:10,240
And she said, "It's a lot to adjust to. "

19
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:12,605
Is she frightened of anything?

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,405
What, like the attacks? I don't know.

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,640
No, not the attacks. You know, I
was actually looking forward to this,

22
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:22,525
living with Nina, but
I'm not sure we're even...

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,880
I mean, yeah, there's moisturiser
and there's Tampax in the bathroom,

24
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:28,965
but it's not like we're having sex.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,965
We watch TV and she's just
sitting on the other...

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,480
I mean, if she could see the screen
from the patio, she'd sit there.

27
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:39,120
She saw you kill someone.

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,840
And that's aside from
all the stuff about us.

29
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,640
So leave! Leave.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,160
What?

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,405
What are you looking at, Mitchell?

32
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,720
Nothing. Why are you so bothered
about Nina all of a sudden?

33
00:01:56,755 --> 00:01:59,720
It's called compassion, George.

34
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:01,685
Ah-huh.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,400
So are we staying here
or going somewhere else?

36
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:06,677
Because I hate this place.

37
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:08,676
I'll meet you outside.

38
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,640
I need to take a piss.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,760
Hello?

40
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,720
Hello?

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,320
Hello?

42
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,200
There was three of them. And
they came from the darkness.

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,040
Their eyes were black and
their teeth tore at me.

44
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:08,320
Hey, are you OK now?

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,000
Can I just state for
the record? Huge fan!

46
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,640
Gotta say, in the flesh?
Very disappointing.

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,080
Come on, walkies. Come on.

48
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,000
Come on, Fido. Show me
what you've got, come on.

49
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,680
Woof! Woof! Down now!

50
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,960
Down, Fido! Down!

51
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,560
It's Mitchell!

52
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,240
Evening. Ivan?

53
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,680
You OK? Yeah, come on! George!

54
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,325
George's... Thing...

55
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,200
The thing that happens to him.

56
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:11,005
Does he ever talk about it?

57
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,720
I mean, do you know how he caught it?

58
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,525
Yeah, he was on holiday

59
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,800
and he went out walking
and he was attacked.

60
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:23,397
He actually met the guy...

61
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:25,925
The wolf. Small world.

62
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,845
Certainly seems to be for us.

63
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,560
So the wolf scratched George
and that's how he caught it.

64
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:34,725
Well, you've seen his...? Yeah.

65
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,360
Well, let's just say, his
vest-wearing days are over.

66
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:40,200
I need to show you something.

67
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,840
When he pushed me back, I got these.

68
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,240
But he hadn't changed, though, had he?

69
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:57,085
Well, his nails needed clipping.

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,245
But he hadn't changed. Not completely.

71
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,440
No, he was still George,
but... So, so you're fine.

72
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,445
But the change had started, Annie.

73
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,160
Nina, one thing I've learned about
this world is it doesn't follow logic.

74
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:11,200
We're talking about magic and curses.

75
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:13,400
We're off the map here.

76
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,600
In there. What?

77
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,160
Oh, my... That smells
disgus... They've split up.

78
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:44,165
The guy.

79
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,340
The girl, I can smell her perfume.

80
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,480
You go after him, I'll go after her.

81
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,205
George. Why are we doing this?

82
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,000
Three times. Three times
I've been attacked now.

83
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:56,520
We should let them go.

84
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,560
Be careful.

85
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,160
I think I can handle her.

86
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:10,600
I know her. Be careful.

87
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,800
That whole thing
outside with my husband,

88
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:09,317
that was rude.

89
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:10,765
I'll talk to him.

90
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,160
Once you get to know us, you'll
see we're not really like that.

91
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,240
A lot of vampires, it's all about
the blood and the world domination.

92
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,760
But me and Ivan...

93
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,120
.. we're just about the tourism.

94
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,285
Oh, mate.

95
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,845
You look awful.

96
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,060
You just smacked me in the face!

97
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:00,787
I think you know what I mean.

98
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:03,480
So it's true, then, you're clean?

99
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:05,125
Yeah, you should try it.

100
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,320
Oh, yes, and maybe one day
I could look like shit, too.

101
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,320
How long have you been back in
the country? Couple of weeks.

102
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:15,325
Daisy's visiting family.

103
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,800
Why did you attack George?
It was my duty. Your duty?

104
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:21,777
You didn't even like Herrick.

105
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:23,720
There are rules, Mitchell.

106
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,920
He was one of us.

107
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,880
Bet I'm not the first. I
won't be the last either, no.

108
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:33,605
Insurgents, Herrick loyalists,

109
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,520
just anybody wanting to
make a name for themselves.

110
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:38,760
His dance card's going
to be pretty full.

111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
I couldn't wait to meet you.

112
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
The killer of kings.

113
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,960
I wanted you for my scrapbook.

114
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,525
What was it like?

115
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,600
I don't remember. A liar.

116
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,720
Sometimes, I actually hear the life

117
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,240
leave them in a sigh.

118
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,520
His blood was cold.

119
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,120
Like water from a stream.

120
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:29,005
Hello.

121
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,640
Is that for me or for the story?

122
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,480
I've been having nightmares.

123
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:43,480
I'm at work, on a ward and my
skin shreds and my bones crack

124
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:45,360
and I attack people.

125
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,840
It's got so bad that I'm
frightened to go to sleep.

126
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,280
It is all I can think
about. I want to scream.

127
00:09:57,315 --> 00:10:00,040
I want to pull my hair out in clumps.

128
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,480
What are you going to do?

129
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,085
Well, the first time he
said he went to some woods.

130
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,640
So he wouldn't hurt anyone. Or
there's that room where it happened.

131
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:15,480
George said he wouldn't use
it again, I could go there.

132
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,317
I mean about telling him.

133
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:19,120
Oh, I don't know. I guess.

134
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,160
Will you come with me?

135
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,960
Well, it's the full moon tomorrow.

136
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,977
I don't want to go on my own.

137
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:32,960
Of course, yeah. Course I will.

138
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:34,400
Thanks.

139
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,680
You're going to be fine.

140
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,520
So you come all this way just
to have a pop at George, huh?

141
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:51,320
Not just that, no.

142
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,445
There's a power vacuum here.

143
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,045
And you intend to fill it? No, no, no.

144
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,080
I just want to sit back
and watch the flames.

145
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:05,205
Brush up on your history.

146
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,360
Taking out someone like Herrick is
never clean, it's never clinical.

147
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:12,200
It leaves a wound. And
wounds get infected.

148
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:14,320
I was in Baghdad.

149
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,640
I saw Phnom Penh.

150
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,640
I want to see what happens here.

151
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,445
Let me make this clear.

152
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,480
An attack on him is an attack on me.

153
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:33,437
You meet anyone,

154
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:35,360
you tell them that.

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,005
And tell them to hide.

156
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,240
We go back to the
shadows, where we were.

157
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:43,920
The revolution has been cancelled.

158
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:48,560
Daisy!

159
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,280
We're leaving.

160
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,165
Sorry. That's my ride.

161
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,880
We're staying at a Travelodge. Find me.

162
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,880
You come back!

163
00:12:01,915 --> 00:12:04,497
Daisy!

164
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:07,045
Yee-hehe!

165
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,400
Hey, pumpkin. Did you have fun?

166
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:11,200
Heaps!

167
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,920
You're sliding into chaos here.
Should be an interesting show.

168
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,680
Hey, Bouncer!

169
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,405
We're not done yet.

170
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,560
We're a long way from being done.

171
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,200
I'll be seeing you.

172
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,720
Toodle-pip.

173
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,725
I'm hungry, baby.

174
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,840
We should grab someone on the way home.

175
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,740
What happened?

176
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:54,525
She attacked me.

177
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,180
But I managed to fight her off. Yeah?

178
00:12:58,215 --> 00:13:01,800
You've got lipstick on your mouth.

179
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
You are very pretty.

180
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:49,360
So are you.

181
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,965
You've only just showered.

182
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,440
So, I'll have another one. After.

183
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,880
Look, sit down.

184
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,765
Look, I know lately
things have been a bit...

185
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,440
It's a lot to take in. You know,
werewolves, ghosts, vampires.

186
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:21,037
I didn't even believe in
homeopathy before this.

187
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:23,676
So why are you still
here? Just tell me that.

188
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:26,245
If it's so difficult,
why are you still here?

189
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,240
I need you to see me through
this. See you through what?

190
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:32,277
George.

191
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:34,245
You...

192
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,320
You? What, yeah, sorry? Hello?

193
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,480
You've forgotten what it's
like, discovering this world.

194
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:44,005
It's not exciting, it's frightening.

195
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,960
You're the only constant I have
left, even if you are part of it.

196
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:51,520
I need you to see me through this.

197
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:53,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

198
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,645
Have you?

199
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,885
Hiya, Annie, I've been meaning to ask.

200
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,885
Have you started dunking
biscuits into your tea now?

201
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,000
It was the next logical step.
Dunking biscuits you can't eat

202
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:18,117
into tea you can't drink
is the next logical step?

203
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:21,200
This should be good. It's
like occupational therapy.

204
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:23,760
What do you do with
them afterwards? What?

205
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:25,640
Wrap them in kitchen towel, George.

206
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,040
I'll, um, see you later.

207
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:31,560
Hmm? Yeah, yeah.

208
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,605
Black coffee. Cheers.

209
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,480
And weird camp herbal fusion thing.

210
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:48,000
Yep, that's me.

211
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,540
OK, shut up! I'm going to tell
you! I've applied for a job!

212
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:59,787
As what? Well, it's something
that I've always fancied.

213
00:15:59,822 --> 00:16:03,811
Well, marrying Colin Firth
isn't, strictly speaking, a job.

214
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:07,800
They're advertising for bar
staff at the New Found Out.

215
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:09,325
The pub?

216
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,200
That's a job you've always
fancied? Jesus, aim for the stars.

217
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:15,925
Well, it's one of the jobs
that I've always fancied.

218
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,560
Well, your first week's wages
are going on Hobnobs. Hold on,

219
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:20,805
are you serious?

220
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,440
I'm as serious as cancer when I say,

221
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:25,097
# Rhythm is a dancer. #

222
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:26,685
You can't get a job, Annie.

223
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,285
But who would know?! I'm
visible now, I'm solid.

224
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,885
You're not, you're squishy!
What about when people touch you?

225
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,520
What kind of pub do you think it
is? Have you worked in a pub before?

226
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:38,525
No, but I've watched The Apprentice.

227
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,280
And in the current job market,
there's less emphasis on experience,

228
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:45,360
because at the end of the day
it is just about giving it 110%.

229
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,325
Did that just happen?!

230
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,320
Well, I think it's a good
thing she's moving on.

231
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:59,245
No. No, you're right.
The disembodied spirit

232
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,800
of a dead woman is getting a
job in the service industry.

233
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:05,017
What could possibly go wrong?

234
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:07,165
Mmm. I know what this is about.

235
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,480
Oh, you do, do you?
That's, that's great.

236
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:11,040
It's your own lack of purpose.

237
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,005
My what?

238
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,520
Well, you're not in a relationship,
you don't have a family or a career.

239
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:22,600
Even the blood lust, a struggle
that's defined the last...

240
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:24,925
How many years? Even
that's under control.

241
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,100
After a life that's been
consistently violent and chaotic,

242
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:31,240
you've nothing left to fight
and nothing left to safeguard.

243
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:33,165
What about the vampire attacks then?

244
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,365
But you're not the target,
it's not about you any more

245
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,040
so there's nothing left for you to
do. You're like a piece of, um...

246
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:43,960
deadly furniture.

247
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,285
Did you just call me deadly furniture?

248
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,620
Annie, meanwhile, has a
purpose. She wants to get a job.

249
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:53,920
And I guess that must be
disconcerting to see that purpose

250
00:17:53,955 --> 00:17:56,485
in other people when you
don't have one yourself.

251
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,600
That's completely... You're an idiot
at the moment, do you know that?

252
00:18:00,635 --> 00:18:03,520
Wooahh! Just saying.

253
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,960
Hi.

254
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,600
What's this? It's a business plan.

255
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:17,445
For what? Here.

256
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,120
Far as I can see, your main
competition is the Duke of Avon.

257
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:23,880
They've got the whole
ironic retro thing going on.

258
00:18:23,915 --> 00:18:26,360
Table football and board games.

259
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:28,805
I come in here and

260
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,240
I'm on a school trip to HMS Belfast.

261
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,420
And who's that?

262
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:36,445
That's Jack.

263
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,180
What's his story? Well, I don't
think he really has a story.

264
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:43,880
If it's busy he collects glasses
and we give him a pint but...

265
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,560
OK, well he can stay for now, we'll
review that situation in a month.

266
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,165
OK. What about you?

267
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,660
No, I... I should stay really.

268
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:59,085
No. I mean, what's your journey?

269
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,440
I'm guessing this wasn't
your first career choice?

270
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,920
So what brought you here, Darren?

271
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:07,085
Hvgh. Wh4t3v3r.

272
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,720
Um. Well, it was my father's
pub. Well, it is my father's pub.

273
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:14,565
But he's ill, so I'm just
here to run things, you know,

274
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,840
till he gets back up on his feet.
Listen, I think it's great that,

275
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:22,577
you know, you've come so well
prepared, but I just think that

276
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:26,280
my dad might be a bit resistant
to some of the things that...

277
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:28,485
Like just for one thing,

278
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,360
I don't think there's really
room for a climbing wall.

279
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:34,480
Oh.

280
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,165
There is another option here.

281
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,720
We could just ignore all that and
you could just give me the job?

282
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:48,200
Would that be all right?

283
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,880
Uh, what, what are you doing?

284
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:56,937
Cleaning. This is the Ladies.

285
00:19:56,972 --> 00:19:58,925
It's a unisex toilet. A what?

286
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,400
There's a sign on the
door. A unisex toilet?

287
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,120
Are we in a fucking kibbutz?

288
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,640
Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll come back.

289
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,440
Look, are you OK?

290
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,280
I was a house officer at
the Whittington in London.

291
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:26,285
I had a boyfriend, a
goldfish, a flat with a garden.

292
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,920
When it was someone's birthday
at work, we'd have wine in mugs

293
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:33,525
and eat Twix fingers and
you know what? It was lovely.

294
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,520
But because I am an idiot and because
it was a promotion, I gave it all up.

295
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:41,925
Me and my goldfish moved here,

296
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,520
where the doctors have an acronym
for unattractive female patients,

297
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:49,405
I- W-E-J-F.

298
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,005
"I Wouldn't Even Jizz In Her Face".

299
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,560
And last night I got home
and my goldfish was gone.

300
00:20:57,595 --> 00:21:00,957
No body, no note, nothing.

301
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:04,285
So, no, I'm really not OK.

302
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,960
D'you have a cat? Cos, well, chances
are that's what ate the goldfish.

303
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:12,440
I don't. But if I did I think I
would have made that connection.

304
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:14,205
A cat must have got in somehow.

305
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,960
Yeah, actually, could you
sort of piss off for a bit?

306
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,160
As my best friend kindly
pointed out this morning,

307
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:33,885
I don't have a girlfriend,
all my family are dead

308
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,880
and I mop up puke and pee and
shit for five quid an hour.

309
00:21:37,915 --> 00:21:39,765
So, as much as I sympathise,

310
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,280
if we're comparing isolation
and disappointment I think I win.

311
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:46,520
I'm Lucy.

312
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,685
Mitchell.

313
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,080
I keep screwing up, Mitchell.

314
00:21:53,115 --> 00:21:56,440
Well, you're in good company.

315
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,800
One bottle of fresh aqua minerale,

316
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:08,360
and one poulet and a string.

317
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,840
Annie?

318
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,120
Mr Galvin? Can you hear me?

319
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,280
Yes. Hi.

320
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,920
OK, we're live.

321
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,180
Professor Jaggat has explained
what we're about to do.

322
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:55,365
This is a decompression chamber.
Like for deep sea divers.

323
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,280
In a sense. The changes you go
through, we believe they're tidal.

324
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:05,880
Just as the gravitational
force of the moon pushes the sea

325
00:24:05,915 --> 00:24:08,725
onto the land, it triggers
a transformation in you.

326
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,160
This chamber will be pressurised
in such a way it will negate

327
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:14,200
the natural tidal force of the moon.

328
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:16,257
So I won't change?

329
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:18,245
So you won't change.

330
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,000
Where is Professor Jaggat?

331
00:24:21,035 --> 00:24:23,685
Moon up in two minutes.

332
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,120
You hear that, Mr Galvin? In
two minutes, nothing will change,

333
00:24:29,155 --> 00:24:31,737
and everything will change.

334
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:34,206
Are you excited? I guess.

335
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:36,605
'Thank you for all this. '

336
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,205
I don't know how I can
ever thank you enough.

337
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,485
One day, you, the professor and
I will sit and take tea together

338
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,400
and gaze up at a full and harmless
moon, and that will be our thanks.

339
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,405
That's odd.

340
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,120
What? The bits of Herrick.

341
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:56,640
They've gone.

342
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,000
Could I hurt you?

343
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:03,365
No. No, no, no.

344
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,485
I am completely dead.

345
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,125
Anyway, it's going to be fine.

346
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,000
Hey, there's a werewolf
called Nina in Buffy!

347
00:25:12,035 --> 00:25:14,000
I've never seen it.

348
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,160
No, well, I stopped watching it
once, you know, I started living it!

349
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,685
What does George do? To prepare.

350
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,040
You saw him transform
once. What did he do?

351
00:25:27,075 --> 00:25:28,725
# If you go down to the woods... #

352
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,640
'Do you think he gets frightened?
Yes. I'm sure he does. Every time. '

353
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,000
# If you go down to the
woods today you'll never... #

354
00:25:40,035 --> 00:25:42,280
Nina, what if you're fine?

355
00:25:42,315 --> 00:25:43,805
I'm sorry, I can't.

356
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,360
This, this life is too much for me.

357
00:25:49,395 --> 00:25:51,120
Sure.

358
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,540
Shall I take my top off?

359
00:25:56,575 --> 00:25:58,567
Oh, yeah. Just in case.

360
00:25:58,602 --> 00:26:00,560
Be a shame to ruin that.

361
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:02,080
Rocha. John Rocha.

362
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,040
So, um, what do we do?

363
00:26:10,075 --> 00:26:11,677
We just wait.

364
00:26:11,712 --> 00:26:13,245
'20 seconds. '

365
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,605
'Can I have a cup of water?'

366
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,760
'We'd prefer you not to eat
or drink till afterwards. '

367
00:26:18,795 --> 00:26:21,685
I feel sick. That happens.

368
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,365
We've already increased
the pressure to 20 psi.

369
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,640
What do you mean, "that happens"?
You said you'd never done this before.

370
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,720
Well, did it work? Did you cure them?!

371
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:35,920
'You said you'd never done this before. '

372
00:26:35,955 --> 00:26:39,685
Did you cure them? Mr Galvin,

373
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,680
we'll need you to talk us through
any changes, any discomfort,

374
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:46,405
any overwhelming emotions.

375
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,600
What happened to the other
werewolves? Are they human now?

376
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:52,637
Full moon. We're at 23 psi.

377
00:26:52,672 --> 00:26:55,640
Mr Galvin, we are at full moon.

378
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,880
It's coming!

379
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,700
Come on!

380
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,600
'Mr Galvin. What is happening to you?'

381
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,120
Nothing.

382
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,160
Nothing's happening.

383
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,045
Stop it!

384
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,880
'Let me change! Let me change!'

385
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,840
Oh, oh God!

386
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,245
Stop it!

387
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,280
'Let me change! Let me change!'

388
00:28:25,392 --> 00:28:28,400
Increase the pressure.

389
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,520
Get me out! Get me out!

390
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,400
That was the last Type Three.

391
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,320
We, um, should go. George...

392
00:30:58,355 --> 00:30:59,925
George'll be home soon.

393
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,400
He'll be wondering where I am.

394
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,085
Tut-tut.

395
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,685
You're very close to the city.

396
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,480
Was that intentional? There's like
four houses just over that ridge.

397
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,485
Did you follow me? No need.

398
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,720
You guys are very easy to predict.

399
00:31:36,755 --> 00:31:39,920
Oh, I found this maybe a mile away.

400
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,685
Aw, that's sweet.

401
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,765
You might tear someone's throat out

402
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,400
but God forbid anyone
should see your winky.

403
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,880
When are you going to
tell him? I'm not. What?!

404
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:06,445
It shouldn't be too hard.

405
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,640
I mean, he kept it secret from
the rest of the world for years.

406
00:32:09,675 --> 00:32:12,285
I just have to keep it
secret from one person.

407
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,600
Then I'll tell him. If you do,
I'll give you fucking rabies!

408
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,040
I can't know and not...

409
00:32:20,075 --> 00:32:22,080
He's my friend.

410
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,565
He won't care what you are.

411
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,400
You think this is about my vanity?

412
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,445
It will destroy him.

413
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,880
Your "friend". It will destroy him.

414
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,060
I get to choose this.

415
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,327
You don't get a say.

416
00:32:46,362 --> 00:32:48,560
Nobody gets a say.

417
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,485
Oh, don't get dressed yet.

418
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,440
I'm liking the whole caveman thing.

419
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,325
Why are you so keen to
drag me over to your side?

420
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,560
I have a "side"? Yes, there
are two types of supernatural.

421
00:33:05,595 --> 00:33:09,365
There are those that hate
it and those that love it.

422
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,200
And your side are always
desperate to make us enjoy this.

423
00:33:13,235 --> 00:33:14,925
To drag us across.

424
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,605
It's like you're trying
to infect us twice.

425
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,400
What makes you so convinced
you're not already there?

426
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,680
I don't like this.

427
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,645
It happens TO me.

428
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,360
Every day, my life before
gets more and more distant,

429
00:33:33,395 --> 00:33:35,760
like it happened to somebody else.

430
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:39,400
And I hate that.

431
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,885
I'm being robbed.

432
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:49,040
Yeah, that's all very nice and
martyr-y, but there's one problem.

433
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:51,605
I don't believe you.

434
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,620
You killed Herrick and
it's like opening a door

435
00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:57,600
and now you're wondering
whether to step through.

436
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,700
When I met Ivan,

437
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:04,245
he said to me,

438
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:10,005
"Come, see the world and fuck. "

439
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:15,440
Sorry, but can you think of a
better way to spend your life?

440
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,900
You knew.

441
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:51,080
Not for sure.

442
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,400
Not till now.

443
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,365
Um, OK!

444
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,360
Well, I'm going to...

445
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,720
When I changed, I lost myself.

446
00:35:09,755 --> 00:35:11,485
I did things...

447
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,160
And George and Annie, they...

448
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,200
They hid.

449
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,040
This is a different life for
you now, Nina, but it's a life.

450
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:27,600
It'd be so easy for you
to surrender right now.

451
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:29,120
You know what I think?

452
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,960
I think this is about your conscience.

453
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,760
You encouraged me and George.

454
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,485
You told him to live a life.

455
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,480
You loaded a gun and you
fired it into a crowd.

456
00:35:45,515 --> 00:35:48,600
Bang.

457
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,685
You OK? What's up? Nothing.

458
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,920
It's all wine and roses, George.

459
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,200
Mitchell?

460
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,040
Like she said, it's nothing.

461
00:36:14,075 --> 00:36:16,160
I'm late.

462
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,640
What's going on, Nina?

463
00:36:46,675 --> 00:36:48,085
You hungry?

464
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,140
No, I ate a... I think it was a stag.

465
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:54,160
Bit too much information, George.

466
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:55,965
OK.

467
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
We can add that to the list
of things we don't talk about.

468
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,925
Have a shower.

469
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,280
You're covered in
blood. It's disgusting.

470
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,840
What was that? What happened there?

471
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,480
You, you think you scare me?

472
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,645
Look.

473
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,925
I'm doing my best. But this...

474
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,280
This is not the person I need right now.

475
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:26,325
You... FUCK YOU!

476
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,640
You think the last few
weeks have been easy for me?

477
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:32,045
The last few years?

478
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,640
No, but you've lived in this
world a lot longer than me.

479
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:41,200
I'm saying it's a lot to
deal with... Oh, here we go.

480
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:45,520
The same bloody
conversation, over and over!

481
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,325
So why are you still here?

482
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,600
You can walk away from
this any time you want.

483
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:55,645
I can't go. Oh, come on!

484
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,645
It's not like I wouldn't understand!

485
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,240
It's not like nobody's
walked out on me before.

486
00:38:00,275 --> 00:38:01,965
I can't go, George.

487
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,365
Why? I can see it in your eyes.

488
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,440
The disgust. I touch you and
you flinch. You literally flinch.

489
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:13,200
My God, do you know how that feels?

490
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,540
I'm not saying you should find
this easy, but do me a favour, Nina,

491
00:38:19,575 --> 00:38:24,280
and take your disdain somewhere
else. Because to get that every day,

492
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:28,480
to see that from someone I
love, is just another punishment.

493
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:32,920
I didn't just find out there's no Santa.

494
00:38:32,955 --> 00:38:34,805
You've wrecked everything.

495
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,360
You didn't mean to, I know, but
you've torn everything apart.

496
00:38:38,395 --> 00:38:42,337
You're doing it again!

497
00:38:42,372 --> 00:38:46,280
This is not about YOU!

498
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,200
What are you doing?

499
00:38:51,235 --> 00:38:52,760
Is that perfume?

500
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,120
Don't be ridiculous. My God, it stinks.

501
00:38:57,155 --> 00:38:58,565
You're imagining it, Nina.

502
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,325
Hold on. I've smelt that before.

503
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,040
Last night, when you and
Mitchell went for a drink.

504
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:06,040
Mitchell. Oh, is this about Mitchell?

505
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:08,957
What? Is there a...

506
00:39:08,992 --> 00:39:11,805
My God, with him?

507
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,560
I'm not even going to
dignify that with a response.

508
00:39:14,595 --> 00:39:16,965
Well, it makes sense, doesn't it?

509
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,080
I mean, you can't touch
me, you won't go near me...

510
00:39:20,115 --> 00:39:22,157
Jesus Christ.

511
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:24,165
Jesus Christ!

512
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,725
Now you give me this as well?

513
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,480
Isn't that what you just accused me
of? I didn't accuse you of anything.

514
00:39:29,515 --> 00:39:31,525
You both seem very cosy all of a sudden.

515
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,880
Plus I've had Mitchell telling
me off for being unsympathetic,

516
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:38,200
and that explains the reason
why you're so reluctant to leave.

517
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:44,240
Mmm. Yeah. Well, this
should put your mind at rest.

518
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,205
That's great, yeah(!) Oh, my God.

519
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,200
All those things you said about how
you'd had enough of men like him,

520
00:39:54,235 --> 00:39:57,217
how with me you were finally
making the right decision.

521
00:39:57,252 --> 00:40:00,165
Don't you get it? I need
you. You can't push me away.

522
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,000
I can't face this on my own.
Everything outside is torture.

523
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,560
You gave it to me, George!

524
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,960
What?

525
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,485
In that room.

526
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,480
You pushed me away and you
scratched me. You gave me the curse.

527
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,940
But last night...

528
00:40:24,975 --> 00:40:26,880
Was very busy.

529
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,080
I'm a werewolf!

530
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,600
I'm a fucking werewolf!

531
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,540
There's a goldfish on my table.

532
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:17,187
He's not your original goldfish.

533
00:41:17,222 --> 00:41:19,800
I haven't been holding him hostage.

534
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,280
Um, are you even allowed to
put goldfish in jars any more?

535
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:29,125
Who says you can't? I
don't know. The people.

536
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,920
I'm sure there's a thing now that
you can't put goldfish in jars.

537
00:41:32,955 --> 00:41:36,520
You made that up. It's very possible.

538
00:41:36,555 --> 00:41:38,480
So what's his name?

539
00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:40,005
Trevor.

540
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,600
Trevor? Hmm-mm.

541
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,560
Hello, Trevor!

542
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,120
And do we have joint custody?

543
00:41:48,155 --> 00:41:50,965
No, he's, um, all yours.

544
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,640
But I might want to visit
him from time to time.

545
00:41:53,675 --> 00:41:56,205
OK, that's, that's fine.

546
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,920
I'd like that. I think that will happen.

547
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,240
I've just got out of a,
a, a thing with a guy.

548
00:42:10,275 --> 00:42:11,800
I've just got here. It's...

549
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,300
You're right. I'm sorry, that was...

550
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:21,400
It's cool. These things take time.

551
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,400
And that's one thing I've got.

552
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,680
So soft drinks at the bottom
and then lagers at the top.

553
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:35,285
Lagers at the top.

554
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,680
OK? And aside from that, just
make sure that we're stocked up.

555
00:42:38,715 --> 00:42:40,365
OK. OK?

556
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,445
Right, well I think the best thing to do

557
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,120
is just let you loose on a
customer, see what happens.

558
00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:48,680
Bring him/her on!

559
00:42:48,715 --> 00:42:50,240
Yes!

560
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,240
OK.

561
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,880
Right.

562
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,405
Gosh, and he's handsome.

563
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,880
Maybe I should do this one. Oh, no,
no, no. I am going to serve his ass.

564
00:43:06,915 --> 00:43:08,805
Yeah. OK. All right.

565
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,080
Hello, sweetheart. The usual?

566
00:43:11,115 --> 00:43:13,285
Er, I've never been here before.

567
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,440
No, you don't look like
our usual clientele.

568
00:43:16,475 --> 00:43:19,560
Well, it's like Driving
Miss Daisy in here.

569
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:21,125
Annie.

570
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,400
Hold on there, squire. All right?

571
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,720
Hi. Um, it's great that
you're being so friendly, yeah,

572
00:43:29,755 --> 00:43:31,725
but just keep it simple for now. Right?

573
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,040
Just find out what he wants
and make him feel welcome.

574
00:43:35,075 --> 00:43:37,400
OK. Got you. OK? Yeah. All right, yeah.

575
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:38,960
You're fine. OK.

576
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,320
What would you like?
Vodka, soda, no ice.

577
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,680
I'm afraid we don't do cocktails.

578
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,285
I'm... I'm just kidding!

579
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,680
I'm just kidding, no! We are
just so thrilled that you're here.

580
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,325
Ooh, whoops!

581
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,365
It got me! Man down!

582
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,045
Anyway, that's nine pounds.

583
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,680
What? Two pounds. Two pounds,
two pounds. Eighty. Eighty.

584
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,445
Er... here. Two sixty. Shit, sorry.

585
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,840
It's fine. Yeah? Really. Yeah,
it's fine. Don't worry about that.

586
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,885
It's my first day.

587
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,440
Really? Well, you'd never know.

588
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,320
# It's a simple town

589
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,800
# With a lonely sound

590
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,160
# There's demons in the trees

591
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,560
# Come and rescue me

592
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,760
# It's a simple town

593
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,640
# Where the face becomes a veil... #

594
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,325
Concentrate.

595
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,840
Hush little
baby, don't say a word.

596
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,240
Mama's going to buy you a mockingbird.

597
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,880
And if that mockingbird won't sing...

598
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,360
.. Mama's going to buy
you a diamond ring.

599
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,000
Now who's following who?

600
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,400
I work here.

601
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,420
You're kidding. Small world.

602
00:45:44,455 --> 00:45:46,920
What are you doing, Daisy?

603
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:48,440
Just visiting family.

604
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,400
Doesn't she look pretty?

605
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,680
Sure.

606
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,540
Is she your mum?

607
00:46:03,575 --> 00:46:05,360
She's my daughter.

608
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,765
I met Ivan just after I had her.

609
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,240
She was fine. She had aunts and cousins.

610
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:16,600
Besides, look at her.

611
00:46:16,635 --> 00:46:18,697
Good innings.

612
00:46:18,732 --> 00:46:20,760
Wedding ring.

613
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,400
I could be a grandmother!

614
00:46:25,435 --> 00:46:27,840
Oh, that makes me feel old.

615
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:29,360
She's the last thread.

616
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,160
I thought I'd cut it.

617
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,680
Daisy.

618
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,260
Give me the scissors.

619
00:46:43,295 --> 00:46:45,405
It scratches you inside.

620
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,680
Even from the other end of the world.

621
00:46:47,715 --> 00:46:49,480
And you have to stop it.

622
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,765
I called in

623
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,620
to see her at her house.

624
00:46:55,655 --> 00:46:58,767
I thought I'd done the job,

625
00:46:58,802 --> 00:47:01,845
but she's a fighter, like me.

626
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,000
Don't hurt her any more. Let her sleep.

627
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,600
Look at you. Still so moral,
so desperate to be human.

628
00:47:10,635 --> 00:47:14,200
Like mooning after a lover
that left you years ago.

629
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,440
She had everything.

630
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,700
Become cruel.

631
00:47:36,735 --> 00:47:38,720
It's fun.

632
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,600
She's the last person who needed you.

633
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,365
What?

634
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,040
She wanted...

635
00:47:52,075 --> 00:47:53,120
you.

636
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,880
Ivan just wanted a portable fuck.

637
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,685
I guess that must hurt.

638
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,320
You... you don't know
what you're talking about.

639
00:48:04,355 --> 00:48:05,720
It's not her fault.

640
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,120
It's not her fault.

641
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,600
Where are you going? I
could tear her throat out!

642
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:22,840
Go for it. But don't imagine
it'll make her go away.

643
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:25,760
I'll do it. I'm not like you.

644
00:48:25,795 --> 00:48:27,880
I can't be like you!

645
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,480
Not you.

646
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,720
Don't let me have done this to you.

647
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,320
Not you.

648
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,360
Not to you, not to you.

649
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,080
You didn't know, baby.

650
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,920
You didn't know.

651
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,845
Are you having another drink
or not? Well, here's the thing.

652
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,960
I'm looking at a property on Oxford
Road and... Saul's a property developer.

653
00:50:06,995 --> 00:50:09,685
Yeah, high-end stuff. Corporate lets.

654
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,360
The properties round here are
low-hanging fruit, Saul says.

655
00:50:13,395 --> 00:50:16,605
Well, I love it round here. Yeah? Yeah.

656
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,120
Anyway, Duncan who I work
with, he drops me off,

657
00:50:19,155 --> 00:50:21,017
and I leave my jacket in his car.

658
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:22,845
No phone, no wallet, no cash.

659
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,980
Ah. I just need to make a
call, get him to pick me up.

660
00:50:26,015 --> 00:50:29,080
Well, there's a payphone
on Windsor Terrace. Yeah?

661
00:50:29,115 --> 00:50:32,365
Yeah. Then that's where I'll go. Cheers.

662
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,525
Oh, no, no, no! Why don't you just
use the one at my house? Oh, well...

663
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,520
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Yeah, he's right. I might murder you.

664
00:50:40,555 --> 00:50:42,205
Oh, God.

665
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,125
Plenty have tried!

666
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,205
No honestly, it's fine.

667
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,680
Customer care is very important
to us here at the New Found Out.

668
00:50:49,681 --> 00:50:50,680
Isn't that right, Hugh?

669
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:52,800
Well, yeah, but... Great.

670
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,840
Shall we? After you. OK.

671
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,365
Well.

672
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,565
We all saw that coming.

673
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,800
He must have got held up. Oh,
would you like a cup of tea?

674
00:51:06,835 --> 00:51:08,960
You are an angel, I swear to God.

675
00:51:08,995 --> 00:51:10,480
Thank you.

676
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,600
Hey, I'm a friend of Annie's.

677
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,160
I thought you two were working?
Finished early. Went drinking.

678
00:51:29,195 --> 00:51:32,245
Ah, are you both drunk? Er, no! A bit.

679
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,120
Why's there a really handsome
man in the living room?

680
00:51:35,155 --> 00:51:37,480
That's Saul, a customer from the pub.

681
00:51:37,515 --> 00:51:39,400
You think he's handsome?

682
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,560
Hey. All right? I'm with Annie.

683
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,565
Who's the guy? Saul. A
customer from the pub.

684
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,360
You're already bringing work
home? Nina thinks he's handsome.

685
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,360
Annie will back me up on this.

686
00:51:55,395 --> 00:51:56,400
God, yeah.

687
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,485
Nah, he's not handsome.

688
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,920
Ah, thank you. Why does this always happen
when you tell a man another man is handsome?

689
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,400
It is possible for
two men to be handsome.

690
00:52:07,435 --> 00:52:08,565
Three men.

691
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,325
Although he is really handsome.

692
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,800
Look, can we talk about
something else? I'm a werewolf.

693
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,445
I guess he's fairly handsome.

694
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,480
Yes, well, let's hope
he's deaf as well. Nina.

695
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,525
I don't know what happens now.

696
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,060
I don't know how I feel about this,

697
00:52:29,095 --> 00:52:31,560
or any of you or what you expect of me

698
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:33,280
or how you think I should react.

699
00:52:33,315 --> 00:52:34,845
Well, no-one helped us.

700
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,840
Annie was here for a
year before we moved in.

701
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:40,800
George was alone for six
months before I met him.

702
00:52:40,835 --> 00:52:43,960
And until then I had
no-one in the world.

703
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:46,045
It's going to be different for you.

704
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,440
Whatever happens next,
there's four of us now.

705
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,885
Hiya.

706
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,360
Hey. Avon and Somerset Energy.

707
00:52:57,361 --> 00:53:01,360
We've had reports of a gas leak, so
we're checking all the households.

708
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:03,925
Right, erm... do you need to come in?

709
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,800
Actually, we need to move
everyone out, till it's safe.

710
00:53:06,835 --> 00:53:10,280
You're kidding? What's
going on? Gas leak.

711
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:12,405
Everyone's got to leave their houses.

712
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,125
Where have they all gone?
Just around the corner.

713
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,880
Should only take about ten minutes,
but we need to keep the street clear.

714
00:53:18,915 --> 00:53:22,840
You know, I bet those people
are going to be really thirsty.

715
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,320
What's going on?

716
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,180
# Time and space stretch out before you

717
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:42,120
# And the universe implores you... #

718
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,840
I've made teas and coffee, so I
don't know if you're interested...

719
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,680
Do you want to get tea or coffee?

720
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,720
But there's no biscuits or anything,
so don't freak out. Hi. Tea? Coffee?

721
00:53:54,755 --> 00:53:57,840
There's sugar if you want some.
Thank you. That's all right.

722
00:53:57,875 --> 00:54:01,005
There's tea, coffee over
there. Hi. Tea? Coffee?

723
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,400
Thanks very much. It's all right. And
there's sugar there if you'd like some.

724
00:54:05,435 --> 00:54:09,040
I'm sorry about all that
trouble a few weeks ago.

725
00:54:09,075 --> 00:54:10,605
All the people shouting at you

726
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,440
because they thought you
were touching that kiddie.

727
00:54:13,475 --> 00:54:16,285
Oh, come on. That's
water under the bridge.

728
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,480
Yeah, and there's sugar
there if you'd like some.

729
00:54:19,515 --> 00:54:20,645
Thank you. Lovely.

730
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:25,320
Tea in a crisis, that's what I
say. Is it Earl Grey? PG tips.

731
00:54:25,355 --> 00:54:26,920
My God.

732
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,565
Finally.

733
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:35,040
# You are part of everything

734
00:54:35,075 --> 00:54:39,480
# You are part of everything. #

735
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,200
Come on.

736
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,860
Who did you talk to?
Sir? Which of the three?

737
00:54:56,895 --> 00:54:59,440
Yeah, all of them.
Yeah, they seemed nice.

738
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,805
Nice?

739
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,480
We're clear upstairs.

740
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,960
Bring in our guest. Come on. Come on.

741
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,120
I have to be back by four.

742
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,040
You said this could help me? Because
I'm up for parole at the end of the year.

743
00:55:24,075 --> 00:55:26,645
God's work is its own reward.

744
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,400
Oh, yeah, no, it totally is,
but Professor Jaggat said,

745
00:55:29,401 --> 00:55:32,400
because I'm helping you, then...

746
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,680
We can talk about that later.

747
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,480
Is there anybody in this
house that we can't see?

748
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,500
No. There are no presences, spirits

749
00:55:52,535 --> 00:55:56,240
or unquiet souls in this house?

750
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,480
There was something.

751
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,400
There's been a lot of
activity, a lot of...

752
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,520
And it's left a kind of...

753
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,960
What do you call it? Residue. Yeah.

754
00:56:15,995 --> 00:56:18,560
But it's not here now.

755
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,180
It's funny, you see these things on TV.

756
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:29,400
I didn't think they actually worked.

757
00:56:29,435 --> 00:56:31,725
They don't.

758
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,600
But you didn't know that.

759
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,080
"Then the king commanded,
and they brought forth Daniel,

760
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:01,560
"and they cast him
into the den of lions. "

761
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,525
"Now the king spoke

762
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,600
"and said unto Daniel... "

763
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,760
".. 'Thy God whom thou
serveth continually... '"

764
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,120
"'.. he will deliver thee. '"

765
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,220
You've gone native.

766
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,965
The three of you.

767
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,365
Beasts should be put in cages.

768
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,600
Long live the king! Long live the king!

769
00:58:16,635 --> 00:58:18,200
GEORGE!
