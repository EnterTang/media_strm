1
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,820
林肯

2
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,850
我们中有人曾服役于堪萨斯第二有色兵团
Some of us was in the Second Kansas Colored.

3
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,300
去年四月在詹金斯渡口抗击叛军(詹金斯渡口战役  1864年4月30日)
We fought the rebs at Jenkins' Ferry last April,

4
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,990
在那之前他们刚刚杀害
just after they've killed

5
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,250
在毒泉被俘的所有黑人士兵(在毒泉战役后针对堪萨斯第一有色兵团的屠杀)
every Negro soldier they captured at Poison Springs.

6
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,750
所以这次在詹金斯渡口
So at Jenkins' Ferry,

7
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,260
我们决定不再生俘叛军
we decided warnt taking no reb prisoners.

8
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,560
而是格杀勿论  不留活口
And we didn't leave a one of'em alive.

9
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,270
我们这些死里逃生的人
The ones of us that didn't die that day,

10
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,600
后来加入了美国116有色兵团
we joined up with the 116th U.S. Colored, sir.

11
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,430
位于肯塔基州纳尔逊营
From Camp Nelson Kentucky.

12
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,030
你叫什么  士兵
What's your name, soldier?

13
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,000
哈罗德・格林列兵  长官
Private Harold Green, sir.

14
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,070
我是艾拉・克拉克下士  长官
I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir.

15
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,770
马萨诸塞州第五骑兵团
Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry.

16
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,830
我们的人都在那边待命
We're waiting over there.

17
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,330
我们撇下了战马
We're leaving our horses behind,

18
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,100
准备和第24步兵团一起登船
and shipping out with the 24th Infantry

19
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,530
准备下周攻打威尔明顿
for the assault next week on Wilmington.

20
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,320
你们都当兵多久了
How long've you been a soldier?

21
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,980
两年  长官
Two year, sir.

22
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,050
堪萨斯第二有色步兵团
Second Kansas Colored Infantry,

23
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,720
他们在詹金斯渡口作战非常勇猛
they fought bravely at Jenkins' Ferry.

24
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,940
没错  长官
That's right, sir.

25
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,000
他们消灭了上千叛军  长官
They killed a thousand rebel soldiers, sir.

26
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,010
他们英勇无前
They were very brave.

27
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,530
但却比白人士兵每个月少挣3块钱
And making three dollars less each month than white soldiers.

28
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,680
我们第二兵团的小伙子
Us second Kansas boys

29
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,580
除此之外
Another three dollars

30
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,660
还要被克扣3块钱的制服费
subtracted from our pay for our uniforms.

31
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,630
这倒是真事  不过
That was true, yes sir, but.

32
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,780
现在工资倒是一视同仁了
Equal pay now,

33
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,130
但仍然没有黑人被任命为士官
but still no commissioned Negro officers.

34
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,850
我知道  克拉克下士
I am aware of that, Corporal Clark.

35
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,260
您知道再好不过了  长官  但是
Yes, sir, that's good you're aware, sir. It's only that

36
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,760
你觉得威尔明顿之战
Do you think the Wilmington attack

37
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,670
既然白人现在已经习惯于
Now that white people have accustomed themselves

38
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,680
看到黑奴拿起枪为自己而战
to seeing Negro men with guns, fighting on their behalf,

39
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,470
也默许了黑人士兵和自己拿到同样的军饷
and now that they can tolerate Negro soldiers getting equal pay,

40
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,420
也许过不了几年
maybe in a few years

41
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,240
他们就能接受黑人尉官
they can abide the idea of Negro lieutenants and captains.

42
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,490
50年后  或许会有黑人上校
In fifty years, maybe a Negro colonel.

43
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,020
100年后就能参加选举了
In a hundred years, the vote.

44
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,620
战争结束后你会做什么  克拉克下士
What'll you do after the war, Corporal Clark?

45
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,990
去上班  长官  也许您会雇用我
Work, sir. Perhaps you'll hire me.

46
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,590
没准我会的
Perhaps I will.

47
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,110
但是长官
But you should know, sir,

48
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,550
我不想再擦皮鞋了  也不会理发
that I get sick at the smell of bootblack and I cannot cut hair.

49
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,740
我已经有理发师了
I've yet to find a man could cut mine

50
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,790
所以这倒无所谓
so it'd make any difference.

51
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,400
作为一个白人您的头发太卷了
You got springy hair for a white man.

52
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,430
没错  我前任理发师上吊自杀了
Yes, I do. My last barber hanged himself.

53
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,800
他的前任也一样
And the one before that.

54
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,940
还在遗嘱里把剪子留给我
Left me his scissors in his will.

55
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,370
林肯总统  晚上好  小伙子们
- President Lincoln, sir? - Evening, boys.

56
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,980
我们见过您  就在
We saw you at, we

57
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,830
在  在葛底斯堡见过您
- We were at, at - We was at Gettysburg!

58
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,360
你们在葛底斯堡打过仗吗(1863年葛底斯堡战役为南北战争著名战役)
You boys fight at Gettysburg?

59
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,090
没有  我们上个月刚入伍
Naw, we didn't fight there. We just signed up last month.

60
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,310
我们在两年前的公墓演讲见过他(林肯著名的《在葛}斯堡国家烈士公墓落成仪式上的演说》)
We saw him two years ago at the cemetery dedication.

61
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,540
没错  我们听过那次演讲
Yeah, we heard you speak.

62
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,480
我们  唉呀妈呀
We, damn, damn damn!

63
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,430
您到底有多高啊
Hey, how tall are you anyway?!

64
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,880
老天  快闭嘴
Jeez, shut up!

65
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,120
我的演讲你记住了多少
Could you hear what I said?

66
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,450
不太多  长官  那时
No, sir, not much. It was.

67
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,950
先人立国
Four score and seven years ago,

68
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,380
已逾八十有七载
our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation,

69
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,830
自由平等
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition

70
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,260
乃立国之本
that all men are created equal.

71
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,790
不错  谢谢你
That's good, thank you.

72
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,620
今逢内争
Now we are engaged in a great civil war,

73
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,240
欲明以此
testing whether that nation

74
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,790
为本之国
or any nation so conceived

75
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,850
能永存否
and so dedicated can long endure.

76
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,720
吾人  吾人  吾人来此战场
We are, we are, we are met on a great battlefield of that war?

77
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,790
很好  谢谢
That's good, thank you.

78
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,810
欲以方寸之地
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field

79
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,240
奉我勇士
as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives

80
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,570
勇士者  为赴国难而亡
that that nation might live.

81
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,370
吾人此举
It is

82
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,930
他的叔伯们在战争第二天就牺牲了
His uncles, they died on the second day of fighting.

83
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,690
我还记得最后一段
I know the last part. It is

84
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,120
集合  出发  吾尚存者
- Company up! Move it out! - It is rather

85
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,150
小伙子  该归队了  谢谢你们
Boys, best go and find your company. Thank you.

86
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,160
谢谢您  长官  愿上帝保佑您
Thank you, sir. God bless you.

87
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,800
愿上帝也保佑你
God bless you too.

88
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,770
吾尚存者  当担所余大任
That we here highly resolve

89
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,600
承烈士遗志  倍吾力于未竟之业
that these dead shall not have died in vain.

90
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,180
吾国  神佑之
That this nation, under God,

91
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,660
当获新生之自由
shall have a new birth of freedom,

92
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:41,090
民有  民治  民享之国
and that government of the people, by the people, for the people,

93
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,460
必永续于世
shall not perish from the earth.

94
00:06:53,220 --> 00:07:05,650
1865年1月

95
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:05,650
林肯赢得第二次总统选举两个月后

96
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,650
南北战争进入第四个年头

97
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,390
夜深了
It's nighttime.

98
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:19,620
小船被某种可怕的力量飞速地推动着
The ship's moved by some terrible power, at a terrific speed.

99
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,360
尽管伸手不见五指
Though it's imperceptible in the darkness,

100
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,340
我仍能感觉到我们正向海岸冲去
I have an intuition that we're headed towards a shore.

101
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,110
船上没有其他人
No one else seems to be aboard the vessel and I

102
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,010
我感到一阵强烈的孤独
I'm kinny aware of my aloneness.

103
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,410
若不做那些噩梦(《哈姆雷特》经典独白)
I could be bounded in a nutshell

104
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,870
即使困于核桃壳内
and count myself a king of infinite space

105
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,560
(白宫)

106
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,380
我也可自命为无限疆域之帝王
were it not that I have bad dreams.

107
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,790
我猜我所诧异的是船的速度
I reckon it's the speed that's strange to me,

108
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,240
因为我一直很从容不迫
I'm used to going a deliberate pace.

109
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,710
我应该体谅你  玛丽
I should spare you Mary,

110
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,090
不应该和你讲我的噩梦
I shouldn't tell you my dreams.

111
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,560
我希望能为你分忧
I don't want to be spared if you aren't!

112
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,770
再说你也没体谅过我
And you spare me nothing.

113
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,180
或许这象征着
Perhaps it's

114
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,430
威尔明顿港的战斗
it's the assault on Wilmington port.

115
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,460
你总会在战役之前梦到小船
You dream about the ship before a battle, usually.

116
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,230
头疼怎么样了
How's the coconut?

117
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,280
说不上来
Beyond description.

118
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,020
快两年了  没一点好转
Almost two years, nothing mends.

119
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,930
我也算是战争的受害者
Another casualty of the war.

120
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,120
谁会乐意去听
Who wants to listen to a

121
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,070
一个没用的老婆子抱怨一场车祸呢
useless woman grouse about her carriage accident?

122
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,230
我愿意  拉倒吧
- I do. - Stuff!

123
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,840
你也就跟我讲你的梦  我是给你算命的
You tell me dreams, that's all, I'm your soothsayer.

124
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,110
这就是我对于你的全部意义
That's all I am to you anymore.

125
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,350
我不会再得到你的信任了
I'm not to be trusted,

126
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,270
即便那不是一场简单的车祸
even if it wasn't a carriage accident,

127
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,830
而是一次未遂的暗杀行动
even if it was an attempted assassination.

128
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,420
那次应该不是暗
It was most probably an ass

129
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,520
就是暗杀  而且是针对你的
It was an assassin, whose intended target was you.

130
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,760
宴会准备的怎么样了
How're the plans coming along for the big shindy?

131
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,160
我不想谈宴会的事
I don't want to talk about parties.

132
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,830
你从不在乎宴会
You don't care about parties.

133
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,640
不太在乎  但例行公事也没办法
Not much but they're a necessary hindrance.

134
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,440
我知道了
I know.

135
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,920
我知道小船象征什么了
I know what it's about, the ship.

136
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,860
不是威尔明顿港  不是军事行动
It's not Wilmington Port, it's not a military campaign!

137
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,770
是废奴修正案
It's the amendment to abolish slavery!

138
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,060
否则你怎么会强迫我
Why else would you force

139
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,690
邀请那些激进疯子到家里来
me to invite demented radicals into my home?

140
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,910
你正想办法
You're gonna try to

141
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,430
在任期结束和新就职典礼前
get the amendment passed in the House of Representatives,

142
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,420
让修正案在众议院通过
before the term ends, before the Inauguration.

143
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,050
别在没用的东西上花太多钱
Don't spend too much money on the flub dubs.

144
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,780
没有谁像你一样受人爱戴
No one's loved as much as you,

145
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,870
没有谁像你一样被万人敬仰
no one's ever been loved so much by the people,

146
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,870
你现在可以随心所欲
you might do anything now.

147
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,010
不要把这样的权力
Don't, don't waste that power

148
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,080
浪费在一个注定失败的修正案上
on an amendment bill that's sure to defeat.

149
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,520
你还记得罗伯特也会回来赴宴吗(罗伯特・托德・林肯  林肯长子)
Did you remember Robert's coming home for the reception?

150
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,290
我就知道你会忘
I knew you'd forget.

151
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,430
第13号修正案就是你坐的那条船
That's the ship you're sailing on. The Thirteenth Amendment.

152
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,360
你不说我也知道
You needn't tell me I'm right, I know I am.

153
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,490
这会很晚了  凯克莉夫人(伊丽莎白・凯克莉  前黑奴  后成为裁缝  社会活动家及作家)
Oh it's late, Mrs. Keckley.

154
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,490
夫人需要穿这个参加宴会
She needs this for the grand reception.

155
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,240
这可是精雕细琢的
It's slow work.

156
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,980
晚安
Good night.

157
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,440
你是不是和她讲了你的梦
Did you tell her a dream?

158
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,500
儿童奴隶  12岁  600元

159
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:31,830
儿童奴隶  12岁  600元

160
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,380
两个男孩  700元

161
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,880
爸爸  怎么了
- Papa? - Hmm?

162
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,770
爸爸  我想见威利
Papa, I wanna see Willie.

163
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,280
我也想  泰迪  但是不可能了
Me too, Taddie. But we can't.

164
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,260
为什么
Why not?

165
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,240
威利不在了  他已经过世3年了(威廉・华莱士・林肯  林肯三子  死于肺炎)
Willie's gone. Three years now. He's gone.

166
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,950
我的任务是来升旗
The part assigned to me is to raise the flag,

167
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:11,150
如果设备没问题  我会将它升起
which, if there be no fault in the machinery, I will do,

168
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,320
但之后让国旗飘扬的任务就属于人民了
and when up, it will be for the people to keep it up.

169
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,890
演讲结束
That's my speech.

170
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,940
我们不远万里  为国父林肯而战
We are coming Father Abraham three hundred thousand more.

171
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,840
从密州潺潺溪流  到新英巍巍海岸
From Mississipp's winding stream and from New England's shore.

172
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,370
我们弃业从军  无惧妻离子散
We leave our plows and workshops our wives and children dear.

173
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,310
就算众议院的共和党员都投了赞成票
Even if every Republican in the House votes yes,

174
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,160
但这也无法保证
far from guaranteed,

175
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,520
我们党什么时候团结一致过
since when has our party unanimously supported anything?

176
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,030
就假设所有党员都投了赞成票
but say all our fellow Republicans vote for it,

177
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,100
我们仍然会少20票
We'll still be twenty votes short.

178
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,540
才20票吗  才20票
- Only twenty? - Only twenty!

179
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,860
我们会拉到这20票的
We can find twenty votes.

180
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,050
赞成废奴的20名民主党议员
Twenty House Democrats who'll vote to abolish slavery,

181
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,740
在我看来  你的意见总是很宝贵
- In my opinion - To which I always listen.

182
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,120
是奉承话吧  我洗耳恭听呢
- Or pretend to. - With all three of my ears.

183
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,280
我们很快会打赢这场战争
We'll win the war soon.

184
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,650
这是大势所趋  不是吗
It's inevitable, isn't it?

185
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,070
但毕竟还没有赢
Ain't won yet.

186
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,090
你会以一个英雄形象开始下个任期
You'll begin your second term with semi-divine stature.

187
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,100
想象一下和平对我们的意义
Imagine the possibilities peace will bring!

188
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,720
为什么还要让众议院辩论玷污你的光辉形象
Why tarnish your invaluable luster with a battle in the House?

189
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,650
那里鸡飞狗跳
It's a rat's nest in there,

190
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,590
10个月前否决提案的那帮
the same gang of talentless hicks and hacks who

191
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,770
乌合之众乡巴佬还在那里
rejected the amendment ten months ago.

192
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,660
我们输定了
We'll lose.

193
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,580
我觉得现在我们还是有机会的
I like our chances now.

194
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,890
想一想可能面临的困难
Well, consider the obstacles we would face.

195
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,080
我之前说过
The aforementioned

196
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,900
通过一项修正案需要三分之二人的同意
two-thirds majority needed to pass an amendment.

197
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,480
我们争取到了共和党的大多数
We have a Republican majority,

198
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,280
不过也就一半多一点
but barely more than fifty percent.

199
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,850
百分之五十六
Fifty-six.

200
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,480
我们需要民主党的支持
We need Democratic support.

201
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,980
而目前一个都争取不到
There's none to be had.

202
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,950
上次针对修正案的投票以后
Since the House last voted on the amendment,

203
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,040
众议院有过一次选举
there's been an election.

204
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,980
64位民主党员于十一月离开了众议院
Sixty-four Democrats lost their House seats in November,

205
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,550
也就是说三月会新来64名民主党人
that's sixty-four Democrats looking for work come March.

206
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,740
我知道
I know.

207
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,500
他们不用担心改选
They don't need to worry about re-election,

208
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,930
因此他们可以根据自身利益投票
they can vote however it suits'em.

209
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,160
但我们不能收买投票人
But we can't buy the vote for the amendment,

210
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,230
修正案太重要了
it's too important.

211
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,270
我可没提过收买
I said nothing of buying anything.

212
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,800
我只是说还需要20票
We need twenty votes was all I said.

213
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,290
我的下个任期伊始之时
Start of my second term,

214
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,040
可是有不少职位虚位以待呢
plenty of positions to fill.

215
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,240
总统先生  这是乔利夫妇
Mr. President, may I present Mr. And Mrs. Jolly

216
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,210
他们来自密苏里州
who've come from Missouri to

217
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,000
杰佛逊市  总统
From Jeff City, President.

218
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,560
乔利先生  夫人
Mr. Jolly. Ma'am.

219
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,180
壁炉边这位是苏厄德国务卿
This by the fire is Secretary of State Seward.

220
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,940
杰佛逊市
Jeff City.

221
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,100
我听说过一个杰佛逊市的律师
I heard tell once of a Jefferson City lawyer,

222
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,080
养了一只每天早上叫他起床的鹦鹉
who had a parrot that'd wake him each morning,

223
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,990
鹦鹉每天都喊
crying out,

224
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,220
今天就是圣经预言的末日
Today is the day the world shall end as scripture has foretold.

225
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,110
有一天  律师开枪打死了它
And one day, the lawyer shot him

226
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,510
也许是为了耳根清净吧
for the sake of peace and quiet, I presume,

227
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,520
不过至少对于鹦鹉来说  这预言应验了
thus fulfilling, for the bird at least, its prophecy.

228
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,970
杰佛逊市唯一的收费站在西南部
There's only one tollbooth in Jeff City, to the southwest,

229
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,990
自斯科菲尔德将军驻扎当地以来(约翰・斯科菲尔德  时值北军总指挥)
and this man Heinz Sauermagen from Rolla

230
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,510
被一个罗拉市名叫海因茨・苏尔马根的人
been in illegal possession for near two year,

231
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,530
非法占据近两年之久
since your man General Schofield set him up there.

232
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,290
可那地方由门罗总统授予我的祖父(詹姆斯・门罗  美国第五任总统)
But President Monroe give that toll gate to my granpap

233
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,030
昆西・亚当斯也致信过我的父亲(约翰・昆西・亚当斯  美国第六任总统)
and Quincy Adams give my pap a letter

234
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,190
说那里归我们家族所有
saying it's our'n for keeps.

235
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,920
我太太带来了
Mrs. Jolly got the

236
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,260
给林肯先生看看亚当斯总统的信
Show Mr. Lincoln the Quincy Adams letter.

237
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,780
不必了  乔利夫人
That's unnecessary, Mrs. Jolly.

238
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,350
告诉我您的要求好了
Just tell me what you want from me.

239
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,860
我丈夫有肺气肿  不能闻烟味
Mr. Jolly's emphysema don't care for cigars.

240
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,650
夫人  您了解
Madame. Do you know about the

241
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,170
宪法第13号修正案提案吗
proposed Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution?

242
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,310
是的  先生  所有人都知道
Yes sir, everybody knows of it.

243
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,520
总统赞成这项提案
The President favors it.

244
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,210
你们呢  我们也赞成
- But do you? - We do.

245
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,370
你知道这项法案会废除奴隶制吧
You know that it abolishes slavery?

246
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,670
是的  我知道
Yes sir. I know it.

247
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,100
这是你赞成的原因吗
And is that why you favor it?

248
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,300
我赞成的只是停战
What I favor is ending the war.

249
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,490
我们一废奴  南军就会停战
Once we do away with slavery, the rebs will quit fighting,

250
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,320
因为他们就是为维护奴隶制而战的
since slavery's what they're fighting for.

251
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,770
林肯先生  您总是这样说
Mr. Lincoln, you always say so.

252
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,450
修正案一出台
With the amendment,

253
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,200
奴隶制就会废除  南方叛军也会投降
slavery's ended and they'll give up,

254
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,810
战争也会随之结束
the war can finish then.

255
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,810
假如战争在废奴前就结束  你们还
If the war finished first, before we end slavery, would

256
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,090
林肯总统说除非废奴
President Lincoln says the war won't stop unless

257
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,890
否则战争不会结束
we finish slavery.

258
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,870
我说假如  南军人困马乏
But if it did. The South is exhausted.

259
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,410
假如他们弹尽粮绝
If they run out of bullets and men,

260
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,460
你还会让你们的
would you still want your

261
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,980
你们那里的议员是谁
Who's your representative?

262
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,960
杰佛逊市  是波顿议员吗
Jeff City? That's, Congressman Burton?

263
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,360
瘦竹竿波顿  我是说约西亚・波顿  没错
'Beanpole' Burton. I mean, Josiah Burton, yes.

264
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,110
共和党人
Republican.

265
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,810
相信他还在修正案上摇摆不定
Undecided on the question of the amendment, I believe.

266
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,740
或许你可以去拜见他  告诉他你的热情
Perhaps you could call on him and inform him of your enthusiasm.

267
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,520
好吧  夫人
- Yeah. - Madam?

268
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,370
如果南军下周就投降
If the rebels surrender next week,

269
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,410
你会希望波顿议员
would you, at the end of this month,

270
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,330
在月底对第13号修正案投赞成票吗
want Congressman Burton to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment?

271
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,510
如果战争真的就此结束
If that was how it was, no more war and all,

272
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,010
我想我丈夫
I reckon Mr. Jolly much

273
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,450
会不希望国会通过修正案
prefer not to have Congress pass the amendment.

274
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,380
为什么呢
And, why is that?

275
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,050
因为黑鬼
Niggers.

276
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,260
要是他没有被迫
If he don't have to

277
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,210
让黑鬼们从阿拉巴马跑到密苏里
let some Alabama coon come up to Missouri,

278
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,050
偷了他的鸡  抢了他的工作
steal his chickens and his job,

279
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,250
他大概会支持修正案的
he'd much prefer that.

280
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,830
人民  我似乎开始理解
The people! I begin to see

281
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,860
你为什么要如此迫不及待地推行修正案了
why you're in such a great hurry to put it through.

282
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,990
我可以先看看这封信吗  关于收费站的
Would you let me study this letter, sir, about the tollbooth?

283
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,170
明早再来找我
Come back to me in the morning,

284
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,670
我们会依法处理这件事
and we'll consider what the law says.

285
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,110
别忘了去拜访那位瘦竹竿
And be sure to visit 'beanpole'.

286
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,920
告诉他你们为了结束战争
and tell him that you support passage of the Amendment,

287
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
支持修正案
as a military necessity.

288
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,900
谢谢
Thank you.

289
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,860
尼古拉  有空的话
Oh, Nicolay, when you have a moment

290
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,670
如果你打算用职位换取投票
If procuring votes with offers of employment is what you intend,

291
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,260
那我就去找奥尔巴尼的朋友
I'll fetch a friend from Albany

292
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,840
他可以找来
who can supply the skulking men

293
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,270
一些很擅长搞黑幕的人
gifted at this kind of shady work.

294
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,340
免得我劝说民主党时遭到羞辱
Spare me the indignity of actually speaking to Democrats.

295
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,510
你也不用出面担负责任
Spare you the exposure and liability.

296
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,730
失陪一下  我曾郑重起誓
Pardon me, that's a distress signal

297
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,220
绝不对这个敲门声置之不理的
which I am bound by solemn oath to respond to.

298
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,640
汤姆・本德尔把加德纳先生送的
Tom Pendel took away the glass camera plates of slaves

299
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,150
装着黑奴照片的玻璃相框给打碎了
Mr. Gardner sent over

300
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,170
汤姆说妈妈觉得那东西让人看着难受  可
because Tom says mama says they're too distressing, but

301
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,820
你整夜都做噩梦  妈妈这么做是对的
You had nightmares all night, mama's right to

302
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,850
如果你不让我看那些盘子
I'll have worse nightmares,

303
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,540
我会做更多噩梦的
if you don't let me look at the plates again!

304
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,490
也许吧
Perhaps.

305
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,690
我们共和党内承担不起任何闪失
We can't afford a single defection from anyone in our party,

306
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,440
哪怕一位共和党人在投票时缺席也不行
not even a single Republican absent when they vote.

307
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,010
你知道应该找哪些人谈谈
You know who you've got to see.

308
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,460
去找布莱尔家族
Send over to Blair House.

309
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,770
问问普雷斯顿・布莱尔我能否5点去见他一面(普雷斯顿・布莱尔  美国媒体人及政客)
Ask Preston Blair can I call on him around five o'clock.

310
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,750
愿上帝助你一臂之力
God help you.

311
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,960
鬼知道他会向你提出什么要求
God alone knows what he'll ask you to give him.

312
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,820
一旦你们布莱尔家族发话
If the Blairs tell'em to,

313
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,860
就没有共和党人会反对修正案
no Republican will balk at voting for the amendment.

314
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,360
你指的应该是共和党的保守派
No conservative Republican is what you mean.

315
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,850
所有共和党人都应该是保守派
All Republicans ought to be conservative,

316
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,370
我他妈在自己家里建立了这个党
I founded this party in my own goddamned home

317
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,970
希望它成为一个保守的反奴隶制党派
to be a conservative antislavery party,

318
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,500
而不是该死的废奴主义激进派的玩物
not a hobbyhorse for goddamned radical abolitionists.

319
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,410
小声点  爸爸
Damp down the dyspepsia, Daddy!

320
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,940
你会把孩子吓到的
You'll frighten the child.

321
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,390
你需要我们稳定住
You need us to keep

322
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,450
共和党内的保守派
the conservative side of the party in the traces

323
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,930
与此同时你去说服
while you diddle the radicals

324
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,080
并拉拢塞德斯・史蒂文斯那伙激进派(塞德斯・史蒂文斯  共和党激进派领袖)
and bundle up with Thaddeus Stevens' gang,

325
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,560
你需要我们的帮助
You need our help.

326
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,010
是的  没错
Yes, sir, I do.

327
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,290
那我们有什么好处  你也太直接了
- Well, what do we get? - Whoo! Blunt!

328
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,260
礼貌一点儿  蒙蒂
Your manners, Monty.

329
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,580
我算知道为什么林肯先生把你逐出内阁了
Must be why Mr. Lincoln pushed you out of his cabinet.

330
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,600
他不是被逐出的
He was pushed out.

331
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,530
我不是被逐出的  当然不是
- I wasn't pushed. - Oh of course you weren't.

332
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,330
我主动辞职的
I agreed to resign.

333
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,670
他被逐出是为了安抚那些该死的废奴激进派
He was pushed out to placate the goddamn radical abolishonists!

334
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,940
爸爸  请你注意点
Oh Daddy, please! Daddy.

335
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,750
小伙子  你不介意吧
Oh. You don't mind, boy, do you?

336
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,580
他跟士兵一起混过
He spends his days with soldiers.

337
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,600
他们教了我一首歌  是嘛
- They taught me a song! - Did they?

338
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,660
当兵的最会唱歌了
Soldiers know all manner of songs.

339
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,140
你哥哥鲍勃还好吗
How's your brother Bob?

340
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,360
他还在上学
He's at school now,

341
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,200
不过再过4天他就回来参加宴会了
but he's coming to visit in four days. For the shindy!

342
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,640
上学  真棒啊
At school? Ain't that fine!

343
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,430
至少没去参军
Good he's not in the army!

344
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,250
他想去  但是妈妈不让他去
He wants to be, but mama said he can't

345
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,190
当兵危险得很
Dangerous life, soldiering.

346
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,110
你妈妈不让他去很明智
Your mama is wise to keep him clean out of that.

347
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,140
现在你父亲知道我想要什么
Now your Daddy knows that what I want,

348
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,780
换取我对他的帮助
in return for all the help I give him,

349
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,190
如他所承诺的一样  我要去里士满
is to go down to Richmond like he said I could,

350
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,160
萨瓦那一沦陷我就去(萨瓦那  佐治亚州港口城市)
as soon as Savannah fell,

351
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,910
我还要和杰斐逊・戴维斯谈一谈(杰斐逊・戴维斯 南部邦联总统)
and talk to Jefferson Davis.

352
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,720
告诉他我能提供的条件
Give me terms I can offer to Jefferson Davis

353
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,350
以开启和谈
to start negotiating for peace.

354
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,940
他会和我谈的
He'll talk to me!

355
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,480
你们党内的保守派
Conservative members of your party

356
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,760
想让你听一听来自里士满的提议
want you to listen to overtures from Richmond.

357
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,360
这才是重中之重
That above all!

358
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,430
不到别无选择的时候
They'll vote for this rash and dangerous amendment

359
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,000
他们是不会支持这仓促又危险的修正案的
only if every other possibility is exhausted.

360
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,690
共和党人不等于废奴主义者
Our Republicans ain't abolitionists.

361
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,590
我们不能强迫他们支持废奴
We can't tell our people they can vote yes on abolishing slavery

362
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,370
除非我们可以告诉他们
unless at the same time we can tell'em

363
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,630
你这样做是为了停止战争
that you're seeking a negotiated peace.

364
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,660
里奥  到里士满还远着呢
Leo, it's a hundred miles to Richmond.

365
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,940
给他喝点酒让他多睡一会  好的  夫人
- Get him drunk so he can sleep. - Yes ma'am.

366
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,110
爸爸
Here, Daddy.

367
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,670
谢谢  我来帮你铺好
- Oh. Thank you. - Let's fix this up

368
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,210
我帽子呢  在里奥那
- Where's my hat? - Leo has your hat.

369
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,580
好了吗  去争取和平吧
All right? Go make peace.

370
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,250
战神啊  摧枯拉朽地前进吧
Thunder forth, God of War!

371
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,980
我们首先从海上对威尔明顿发起攻击
We'll commence our assault on Wilmington from the sea.

372
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,700
这怎么被烧了
Why is this burnt?

373
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,340
你孩子玩过这个吗
Was the boy playing with it?

374
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,650
几天前被煤灰烧坏了
It got took by breeze several nights back.

375
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,530
这可是陆军部的官方地图
This is an official War Department map!

376
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,920
全内阁都想听听这意味着什么
And the entire cabinet's waiting to hear what it portends.

377
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,810
一场轰炸
A bombardment.

378
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,130
由海军史上最强大的舰队发动的轰炸
From the largest fleet the Navy has ever assembled.

379
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,800
白首海皇  吾将撼汝
Old Neptune, shake thy hoary locks!

380
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,750
58艘战舰已经在射程内抛锚
Fifty-eight ships are underway

381
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,770
随时准备行动
of every tonnage and firing range.

382
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,520
我们将组成长时间的火力网
We'll keep up a steady barrage.

383
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,490
第一个目标是非瑟堡
Our first target is Fort Fisher.

384
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,080
它是威尔明顿港的要冲之地
It defends Wilmington Port.

385
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,450
长时间的火力网
A steady barrage?

386
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,210
每分钟100发炮弹
A hundred shells a minute.

387
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,640
打到他们投降为止
Till they surrender.

388
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,350
老天  可不是
- Dear God. - Yes, yes.

389
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,380
威尔明顿是他们最后的港口  也就是说
Wilmington's their last open seaport. Therefore

390
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,510
拿下威尔明顿  里士满也手到擒来
Wilmington falls, Richmond falls after.

391
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,080
战争也将随之结束
And the war is done.

392
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,290
恕我冒昧  那为什么
Then why, if I may ask,

393
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,880
公众的视线没有聚焦在威尔明顿
are we not concentrating the nation's attention on Wilmington?

394
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,280
为什么《先驱报》报道的却是
Why, instead, are we reading in the Herald,

395
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,100
我们在促使废奴主义修正案
that the anti-slavery amendment is being precipitated

396
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,810
提交众议院进行辩论呢
onto the House floor for debate?

397
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,350
你急切的愿望
Because your eagerness,

398
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,660
在我看来就是行政权
in what seems an unwarranted intrusion of the Executive

399
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,320
对立法权的无理干涉
into Legislative prerogatives,

400
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,810
它很可能会
is compelling it to it's

401
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,010
让你的计划胎死腹中
to what's likely to be its premature demise.

402
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,040
听到了吗
You hear?

403
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,410
《解放黑人奴奴宣言》已经颁布了(1862年9月22日颁布)
You signed the Emancipation Proclamation,

404
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,780
你应该心满意足了
You're done all that can be expected.

405
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,230
《解放黑人奴奴宣言》只不过是个战时措施
The Emancipation Proclamation merely a war measure.

406
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,430
战争一结束法院就会拿它小题大做的
After the war the courts will make a meal of it.

407
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,080
爱德华・贝茨当司法部长的时候
When Edward Bates was Attorney General,

408
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,190
对这个宣言可是信心满满的
he felt confident in it enough to allow you to sign.

409
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,890
每个律师都有他自己的想法
Different lawyers, different opinions.

410
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,930
宣言只是武装解放黑奴  并没有在其它
It frees slaves as a military exigent, not in any other

411
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,850
我不记得爱德华・贝茨对于
I don't recall Edward Bates being any too certain

412
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,840
宣言的合法性有多么肯定
about the legality of my Proclamation

413
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,460
它只不过是不非法而已
just it wasn't downright criminal.

414
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,940
还处于一个灰色地带
Somewhere's in between.

415
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,740
我还在伊利诺伊州当律师的时候
Back when I rode the legal circuit in Illinois,

416
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,910
我曾为一个来自梅塔莫拉市的老妇辩护
I defended a woman from Metamora named

417
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,780
她叫梅丽莎・格英丝  当时已77岁了
Melissa Goings, 77 years old.

418
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,670
她被指控杀害了她83岁的丈夫
They said she murdered her husband, he was 83.

419
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,620
他丈夫想掐死她
He was choking her,

420
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,660
于是这个女人抓起一根柴火
and she grabbed a hold of a stick of fire wood

421
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,470
打碎了他的脑袋  杀死了他
and fractured his skull, and he died.

422
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,690
她丈夫在遗嘱里写到
In his will he wrote:

423
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,310
我希望她真把我打死了
I expect she has killed me.

424
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,760
否则  我一定会报仇的
If I get over it, I will have revenge.

425
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,990
大家看到她的丈夫是这个德行
No one was keen to see her convicted,

426
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,560
都不想判她有罪
he was that kind of husband.

427
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,130
我征求了起诉律师的意见
I asked the prosecuting attorney

428
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,720
和她短短的见了一面
if I might have a short conference with my client.

429
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,590
我们约在法院的一个房间见面
And she and I went into a room in the courthouse,

430
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,250
但她没有出现
but I alone emerged.

431
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,690
屋里的窗户大开着
The window in the room was found to be wide open,

432
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,530
人们相信她是跳窗自杀了
It was believed the old lady may have climbed out of it.

433
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,150
我告诉法庭监守
I told the bailiff

434
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,620
就在我离开房间之前
Right before I left her in the room,

435
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,790
她问我她哪有好喝的水
she asked me where she could get a good drink of water,

436
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,210
我回答她田纳西州有
and I told her Tennessee.

437
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,100
格英丝夫人再也没有出现在梅塔莫拉
Mrs. Goings was seen no more in Metamora.

438
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,260
正义得到了伸张
Enough justice had been done.

439
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,850
甚至没人向担保人要保释金
They even forgave the bondsman her bail.

440
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,800
我恐怕不太  我断定
- I'm afraid I don't see - I decided

441
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,160
宪法赋予我开战的权力
that the Constitution gives me war powers,

442
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,610
可没人知道那究竟是何种权力
but no one knows just exactly what those powers are.

443
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,790
有人说它不存在  我不知道  我坚信
Some say they don't exist. I don't know. I decided,

444
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,560
我需要它们的存在
I needed them to exist to

445
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,410
以坚守我保护宪法的誓言
uphold my oath to protect the Constitution,

446
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,170
所以我决定
which I decided meant that

447
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,470
我可以把反叛者的奴隶
I could take the rebels' slaves from 'em as

448
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,990
作为战时财产没收充公
property confiscated in war.

449
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,070
这的确可能让人怀疑我与南军看法相同
That might recommend to suspicion that I agree with the rebs

450
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,000
怀疑我从一开始就认为
that their slaves are

451
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,070
奴隶是财产  但我当然不那么认为
property in the first place. Of course I don't.

452
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,020
我从不那样认为  任何人获得自由都令我高兴
I never have, I'm glad to see any man free,

453
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,060
况且若把人视乎财产或战时禁运品
and if calling a man property, or war contraband

454
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,590
即能解放黑奴  我又何苦大费周章
does the trick, why I caught at the opportunity.

455
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,750
棘手的地方是
Now here's where it gets truly slippery.

456
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,540
我应用法律准许战争中没收财产
I use the law allowing for the seizure of property

457
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,030
因为知道
in a war knowing it applies

458
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,400
它仅适用于好战国的政府财产和公民
only to the property of governments and citizens of belligerent nations.

459
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,190
但南方不是一个国家
But the South ain't a nation.

460
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,800
因此我无法跟他们谈判
That's why I can't negotiate with 'em.

461
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,080
那要是我坚称他们只是叛民
So if in fact the Negroes are property according to law,

462
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,560
并非好战国公民
have I the right to take the rebels' property from 'em,

463
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,140
法律规定黑人确实是财产
if I insist they're rebels only,

464
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,150
我有权把他们没收回来吗
and not citizens of a belligerent country?

465
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,950
更麻烦的是
And slipperier still: I maintain

466
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,440
我坚持认为并非我国南方叛乱
that it ain't our actual Southern states in rebellion,

467
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,450
只是因为叛民居于南方
but only the rebels living in those states,

468
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,280
而南方依法为战时状态
the laws of which states remain in force.

469
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,910
依法为战时状态
The laws of which states remain in force.

470
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,350
即是说既然是由宪法决定
That means, that since it's states' laws that determine

471
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,970
黑人能否作为奴隶或财产买卖
whether Negroes can be sold as slaves, as property,

472
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,380
联邦政府不能予以干涉
the Federal government doesn't have a say in that,

473
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,860
起码至今还不能
at least not yet,

474
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:06,320
那些州的奴隶因此便是财产
then Negroes in those states are slaves, hence property, hence

475
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,840
因此我的开战权让我得以
my war powers allow me to

476
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,500
如此执行没收  我就这么做了
confiscate 'em as such, so I confiscated 'em.

477
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,690
但如若我是一名尊崇宪法的人
But if I'm a respecter of states' laws,

478
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,950
除了作废宪法之外
how then can I legally free 'em with my Proclamation as I done,

479
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,860
我又如何能合法地以宣言解放他们
unless I'm cancelling states' laws?

480
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,440
我认为内战需要我这么做
I felt the war demanded it.

481
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,960
我的职责迫使我这么做
my oath demanded it,

482
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,610
我认为这是正确的  希望能合法达到这一目的
I felt right with myself, and I hoped it was legal to do it

483
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,020
至今都希望如此
I'm hoping stilll.

484
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:42,410
两年前我正式宣布解放他们
Two years ago I proclaimed these people emancipated,

485
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,660
那么从此永远地解放了
Then, thenceforward and forever free.

486
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,600
但法庭判决我无此权力
But let's say the courts decide I had no authority to do it.

487
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,420
也许他们做出了正确的裁决
They might well decide that.

488
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,080
假设并未修订废奴修正案
Say there's no amendment abolishing slavery.

489
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,670
假设战后
Say it's after the war,

490
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,030
我将不能再通过
and I can no longer use my

491
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,470
有时不得不使用的开战权
war powers to just ignore the courts' decisions,

492
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,910
忽视法庭判决
like I sometimes felt I had to do.

493
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,960
那么我解放的人民会被重新奴役吗
Might those people I freed be ordered back into slavery?

494
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,680
因此我想要众议院
That's why I'd like to get

495
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,940
通过第13号修正案
the Thirteenth Amendment through the House,

496
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,160
借此得到国家的认可
and on its way to ratification by the states,

497
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,750
一劳永逸
wrap the whole slavery thing up,

498
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,560
尽我所能地解决奴隶制的余孽
forever and aye, as soon as I'm able.

499
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,030
本月末  我想要你们对我做出支持
Now! End of this month! And I'd like you to stand behind me,

500
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,030
做出内阁应有的支持
like my cabinet's most always done.

501
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:40,050
牧师说  我可以少些布道言说
As the preacher said, I could write shorter sermons but

502
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,770
但我一提笔  就无法停下
once I start I get too lazy to stop.

503
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,940
依我看  先生  您这正是
It seems to me, sir, you're describing precisely

504
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,820
民主党所言的独裁者形象
the sort of dictator the Democrats have been howling about.

505
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,920
独裁者向来无视法律
Dictators aren't susceptible to law.

506
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,440
他也如此  他宣扬正是独裁之举
Neither is he! He just said as much!

507
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,880
无视法院  曲解道义  如此
Ignoring the courts, twisting meanings, what

508
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,900
如此慷慨激昂  那么
- what reins him in from, from  - Well,

509
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,750
我想人人都会有激动的时刻
the people do that, I suppose.

510
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,930
一年半前  在第二次竞选前
I signed the Emancipation Proclamation a year and half,

511
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,660
我签署了《解放黑人奴隶宣言》
before my second election,

512
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,790
我自认有权签署
I felt I was within my power to do it.

513
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,800
然而我也知道我或许有错
However I also felt that I might be wrong about that.

514
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,500
我早知人们会那么说
I knew the people would tell me,

515
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,630
就给了他们一年半的时间考虑
I gave 'em a year and half

516
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,370
而他们再次选择了我
to think about it, and they reelected me.

517
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,590
一到二月的首要之事
And come February the first,

518
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,390
便是我要签署第13号修正案
I intend to sign the Thirteenth Amendment.

519
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,110
阿什利代表先生
Well, Mr. Representative Ashley!

520
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,200
国会山那有什么新闻(美国国会的办公大楼  建在一海拔83英尺高地上  故名国会山)
Tell us the news from the Hill.

521
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,380
新闻
Ah! Well, news

522
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,180
为何如此突然
Why for instance is this thus,

523
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,440
这其中又有何缘由
and what is the reason for this thusness?

524
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,910
詹姆斯  我们想由你
James, we want you to bring the

525
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,080
在众议院中提议反奴修正案
anti-slavery amendment to the floor for debate.

526
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,570
不好意思  您说什么  即刻提出
- Excuse me, what? - Immediately.

527
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,620
您负责管理修正案  对吧
You are the amendment's manager, are you not?

528
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,820
是没错  但
I am, of course, but

529
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,530
我们还要指望激进分子的支持
And we're counting on robust radical support,

530
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,530
所以通知史蒂文斯先生一声
so tell Mr. Stevens

531
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,790
我们期待他的支持  此事会很艰难
we expect him to put his back into it. It's not going to be easy,

532
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,750
但我们相信  不可能
- but we trust - It't impossible.

533
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,560
不行  抱歉  我们无法
No, I am sorry, no, we can't

534
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,820
立刻在众议院组织任何事宜
organize anything immediately in the House.

535
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,460
从选举起我就一直在游说民主党员
I have been canvassing the Democrats since the election,

536
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,750
以防他们被击败后一蹶不振
in case any of them softened after they got walloped.

537
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,730
但他们的态度进来日益强硬  国务卿先生
But they have stiffened if anything, Mr. Secretary,

538
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,210
选票还不够
there aren't nearly enough votes

539
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,740
我们是捕鲸者  阿什利先生
We're whalers, Mr. Ashley!

540
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,580
捕鲸者  抓鲸鱼的吗
Whalers? As in, um whales?

541
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,470
我们追杀这条鲸鱼很久了
We're been chasing this whale for a long time.

542
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,100
我们最后向这怪物背上刺入了鱼叉
We're finally placed a harpoon in the monster's back.

543
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,230
开战了  詹姆斯  开战了
It's in, James, it's in!

544
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,720
我们履行了契约  时不可待
We finish the deed now, we can't wait!

545
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,500
否则他一旦反身而动
Or with one flop of his tail,

546
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,410
就会使我们的努力付之一炬
he'll smash the boat and send us all to eternity.

547
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,090
今年本月31日
On the 31st of this month. Of this year.

548
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,540
让众议院就修正案投票
Put the amendment up for a vote.

549
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,910
捕鲸者
Whalers?

550
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,220
他这么说的
That's what he said.

551
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,670
他这辈子从未上过捕鲸船
The man's never been near a whale ship in his life!

552
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,770
撤回激进分子的支持
Withdraw radical support,

553
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,720
逼他放弃他的野心
force him to abandon this scheme, whatever he's up to.

554
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,390
他做事总拖泥带水
He-He He drags his feet about everything,

555
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,020
林肯  为何这次如此心急
Lincoln. Why this urgency?

556
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,950
我们人多  可以不费力地
We got it through the Senate

557
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,860
让参议院通过了此事
without difficulty because we had the numbers.

558
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,270
这样12月众议院也会同样通过
Come December you'll have the same in the House.

559
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,450
修正案会轻松通过
The amendment'll be the easy work of ten minutes.

560
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,090
他在以修正案胁迫
He's using the threat of the amendment

561
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,110
反叛者立刻投降
to frighten the rebels into an immediate surrender.

562
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,980
我想我们会很高兴看到那一幕的
I imagine we'd rejoice to see that.

563
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,230
就算我们通过了
Will you rejoice, when the

564
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,790
等南方各州遂了林肯的意
Southern states have re-joined the Union pell-mell as

565
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,990
重新加入联邦的乱局
Lincoln intends them to,

566
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,550
依次拒批修正案的话  你会开心吗
and one by one each refuses to ratify the amendment?

567
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,390
因此我们不会通过
If we pass it, which we won't.

568
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,640
我们为什么要同他合作
Why are we co-operating with-with him?

569
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,870
我们都知道他在做什么  他会做什么
We all know what he's doing, and we all know what he'll do.

570
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,300
我们不能顺应
We can't offer up abolition's

571
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,190
最想合法废奴的人的手腕
best legal prayer to his games and tricks.

572
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,350
他说过他会
He's said he'd welcome the

573
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,050
以被囚的奴隶迎接南军
South back with all its slaves in chains.

574
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,350
三年前他那么说  以平息
Three years ago he said that. To calm the border states

575
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,030
各州  我不知道
- when we were - I don't.

576
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,610
你刚说
You said

577
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,100
我们知道他要做什么  但我不知道
we all know what he'll do. I don't know.

578
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,420
你知道他不可信  信任吗
- You know he isn't to be trusted. - Trust? Oh

579
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,150
抱歉  我还以为
I'm sorry, I was under the

580
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,510
你是政治家呢
misapprehension your chosen profession was politics.

581
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,720
我未曾信任过总统  或是任何人
I've never trusted the President. I never trust anyone.

582
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,710
但他没有让你惊讶吗
But hasn't he surprised you?

583
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,550
没有  史蒂文斯先生  一点也没有
No, Mr. Stevens, he hasn't.

584
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,540
什么也震惊不了你  阿萨
Nothing surprises you, Asa.

585
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,910
所以对你而言不存在惊讶
Therefore nothing about you is surprising.

586
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,440
也许这就是为何
Perhaps that is why your

587
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,420
您没有再次当选
constituents did not re-elect you to the coming term.

588
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:26,020
太迟了  我老了  我要回家
It's late, I'm old, I'm going home.

589
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,490
林肯成日游手好闲  是南方人
Lincoln the inveterate dawdler, Lincoln the Southerner,

590
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,680
是屈从的妥协者
Lincoln the capitulating compromiser,

591
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,690
是我们的敌人  也是
our adversary and.

592
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:47,150
被上帝遗弃的共和党  我党的领袖
leader of the god forsaken Republican Party, our party.

593
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,500
亚伯拉罕・林肯要求我们
Abraham Lincoln has asked us to work with him

594
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,500
与他一起废除美国的奴隶制
to accomplish the death of slavery in America.

595
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,270
即便反对
Retain, even in opposition,

596
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,720
也要保持你们讶异的能力
your capacity for astonishment.

597
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,750
谁都不许提起总统
The President is never to be mentioned.

598
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,240
也不许提起我  不注意的话就等着喝西北风吧
Nor I. You're paid for your discretion.

599
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,730
不过  不给钱我就不能保证
Hell, you can have that for nothin'.

600
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,100
我们要钱是为了贿赂选票
What we need money for is bribes.

601
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,130
钱能通神
It'd speed things up.

602
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,700
不  任何事都必须合法
No. Nothing strictly illegal.

603
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,590
贿赂议员的确不合法
It's not illegal to bribe Congressmen.

604
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,790
但不受贿他们就会饿死
They starve otherwise.

605
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,400
我跟比尔博先生和莱瑟姆先生解释了
I have explained to Mr. Bilbo and Mr. Latham

606
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,130
我们为投赞成票的民主党人提供工作
that we're offering patronage jobs to the Dems who vote yes.

607
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,330
只提供工作  仅此而已  没错
- Jobs and nothing more. - That's correct.

608
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,820
议员真不值钱
Congressmen come cheap!

609
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,120
几千块就搞定了
Few thousand bucks'll buy you all you need.

610
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,360
你这么说  总统会不高兴的
The President would be unhappy to hear you did that.

611
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,220
那我们输了的话他会高兴吗
Well, will he be unhappy if we lose?

612
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,610
先生们  我付的钱只能用在
The money I managed to raise for this endeavor

613
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,540
你们的衣食住行花销上
is only for your fees, your food, and lodgings, sir.

614
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,650
要是那个松鼠猖獗
If that squirrel-infested

615
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,720
四个人挤在一起的阁楼算宿舍的话
attic you've quartered us in's any measure,

616
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,380
你这费用还真吃紧
you ain't raised much.

617
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,900
可以开工了吗
Shall we get to work?

618
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,950
众议院有请费尔南多・伍德
The House recognizes Fernando Wood,

619
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,280
众议院辩论开始
1月9日

620
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,530
尊敬的代表来自纽约
the honorable representative from New York.

621
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,460
尊敬的各位同僚
Estimable colleagues.

622
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,130
两年前的本月
Two bloody years ago this month,

623
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,850
亚伯拉罕古猿国王一世
his Highness King Abraham Africanus the First,

624
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,650
我们的伟大篡权暴君
our Great Usurping Caesar,

625
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,820
破坏人身保护权和言论自由权之徒
violator of habeas corpus and freedom of the press,

626
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,660
滥用宪法赋予州的权利之人
abuser of states' rights

627
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,470
若林肯真是暴君  伍德先生
If Lincoln really were a tyrant, Mr. Wood,

628
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,100
他早就会把你的空脑壳钉穿了
he'd'a had your empty head impaled on a pike!

629
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,990
这样对我们的国家也好
And the country better for it!

630
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,980
你们这些激进的共和独裁者
Your radical republican autocrat

631
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,290
受制于法令和戒严令
ruling by fiat and martial law,

632
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,480
给他的名字贴上罪恶而违法的
affixed his name to his on a

633
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,480
黑奴解放宣言标签
heinous and illicit Emancipation Proclamation,

634
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,330
保证宣言会加速结束内战
promising it would hasten the end of the war,

635
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,120
然而战火依旧  熊熊燃烧
which yet rages on and on.

636
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,670
他如暴君般声称
He claimed, as tyrants do,

637
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,730
战事的紧急准许他把我们的部队
that the war's emergencies permitted him to turn our army

638
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,780
纽约代表团看起来完全不为所动啊
The New York delegation's looking decidedly uninspired.

639
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:12,790
激进共和主义即是盲从废奴主义
and radical Republicanism's abolitionist fanaticism!

640
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,050
他的《解放黑人奴隶宣言》
His Emancipation

641
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,950
将千百万美金付之一炬
Proclamation has obliterated millions of dollars

642
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,890
宾夕法尼亚那边
Over in Pennsylvania

643
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,160
慌张的啃手指的人是谁
who's the sweaty man eating his thumb?

644
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,260
我不清楚  看起来快吓尿裤子了
Unknown to me. Seems jumpy.

645
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,910
说不定他真会尿出来
Perhaps he'll jump.

646
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,820
但这一切对这名独裁者来说远远不够
But all that was not enough for this dictator,

647
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,260
现如今他还要暗示
who now seeks to insinuate

648
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,950
老天
Jesus!

649
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,250
这个冒失的混球什么时候能坐下
When's this son-of liberty sonofabitch gonna sit down?

650
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:48,060
他再不停  约翰・埃利斯就要把表弄坏了
John Ellis is going to break his watch if he doesn't stop.

651
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,380
他再一次要求大家
We are once again asked

652
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,080
不对  是强迫大家考虑第13号修正案的提议
Nay, commanded to consider a proposed thirteenth amendment.

653
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,230
若此案通过  就等于即刻释放了
Which, if passed, shall set at immediate liberty

654
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,780
四百万有色人种
four million coloreds while

655
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,510
同时束缚了美国白人
manacling the limbs of the white race in America

656
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:07,060
但那只是假设  我们不会让它通过
If it is passed. But it shall not pass!

657
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,040
更有趣的是
What's more interesting is

658
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,410
伊曼先生似乎十分阴沉不快
how dismal and disgruntled Mr. Yeaman appears.

659
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,110
每一位众议院成员
Every member of this House.

660
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,720
他该欢呼的  可是
He should be cheering right now, but

661
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,230
他像吃坏肚子了
Looks like he ate a bad oyster.

662
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,870
各位都该反对
and the constituents which it serves shall oppose!

663
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,250
可以插一句吗  议长先生
A point of order, Mr. Speaker, if you please?

664
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,740
议长先生  我还没讲完
Mr. Speaker, I still have the floor,

665
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,170
而宾夕法尼亚来的先生
and the gentleman from Pennsylvania

666
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,420
却要捣乱  伍德先生何时
- is out of order! - When will Mr. Wood

667
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,450
才能结束这冗长不休的讲演呢
conclude his interminable gabble?

668
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,920
有些人需要呼吸氧气
Some of us breathe oxygen,

669
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,980
而我们在他的讲说中发现
and we find the mephitic fumes of his oratory

670
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,450
对我们肺部有致命威胁的恶臭
a lethal challenge to our pulmonary capacities.

671
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,910
我们该反对修订案
We shall oppose this amendment,

672
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,030
以及任何冒犯自然法则
and any legislation that so affronts natural law,

673
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,430
和侮辱人神的法令
insulting to God as to man!

674
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,530
国会定不能忤逆上帝
Congress must never

675
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:00,270
宣布他所创造的不同可以等同
declare equal those whom God created unequal!

676
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,730
奴隶制才是对自然法则唯一的侮辱
Slavery is the only insult to natural law,

677
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,370
你这愚昧的蠢材

教教我们  伟大的平民
Instruct us, Oh Great Commoner,

681
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,750
你认为什么才是忤逆自然的

682
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,990
黑鬼参与投票吗
Niggrahs casting ballots?

683
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:30,650
黑鬼代表吗  这些就不忤逆自然了吗  史蒂文斯
Niggrah representatives, is that natural, Stevens?

684
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,750
异族通婚吗
Intermarriage?

685
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,280
亵渎了自然法规的是奴隶制
What violates natural law, slavery,

686
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,000
还有你  彭德尔顿  你侮辱上帝
and you, Pendleton, you insult God!

687
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,420
你这个忤逆自然的杂音
You unnatural noise.

688
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,450
克法克斯先生  请维持秩序
Mr. Coffax, please, use your gavel.

689

你自己送你的破产请愿书

尼古拉先生说爸爸在单独会见布莱尔先生
Mr. Nicolay says daddy's secluded with Mr. Blair.

717
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,720

718
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,820
你跟他一样不好好吃饭  没有

郑重前来进行和平谈判
They're coming in earnest to propose peace.

731
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,970
我知道这对你来说是不好的消息

732
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,620
现在听我说
Now hear me.

733
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,630
我去里士满见卖国贼
I went to Richmond to talk to traitors,

734
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,590
跟他们谈话赔笑  还恳求他们
to smile at and plead with traitors,

735
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,000
因为还有两个月就到春天了
because it'll be spring in two months,

736
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,740
道路就可以通行了  春季屠杀就会开始
the roads'll be passable, the Spring slaughter commences.

737
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,630
过去四个春天了
Four bloody Springs now!

738
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,010
想想你深埋心底的我的弗兰克
Think of my Frank, who you've taken to your heart,

739
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,660
想想内战夺走了数以万计的孩子性命
how you'll blame yourself if the war takes my son

740
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,120
你会如何怪责自己
as it's taken multitudes of sons.

741
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,910
想想不和解还将有多少孩子死去
Think of all the boys who'll die if you don't make peace.

742
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,440
你必须跟这些人谈谈

- And in return, I must ask you - No, this is not horsetrading,

745
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,620
这事关性命  闲人勿扰
- this is life! -  NOT NOW!

746
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,520

现在南方人来了
Those Southern men are coming.

754
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,190
我以父之名恳求您  先生

I understand.

756
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,070
跟他们和平谈判吧
Talk peace with these men.

757

第五区联邦收益估价员
Assessor for the Fifth District of Pennsylvania.

762
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,870
那么从今天起
So the total of representatives

763
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:12,080
代表投票总数减少到182票
voting three weeks from today is reduced to 182,

764
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,500
因此众议院所需的
which means 122 yes votes

765
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,060
三分之二就是122票赞成
to reach the requisite two thirds of the House.

766
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,500
假设有民主党人投票给修正案
Assuming all Republicans vote for the amendment.

767
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,720
那去除弃权票
Then, despite our abstention,

768
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,290
还差20票赞成才能达到三分之二
to reach a two-thirds majority we remain 20 yeses short.

769
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,690
我们要从64名

770
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,090
即将卸任的民主党员官员争取来
seeking from among 64 lame duck Democrats.

771
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,320
这其中有39人无法劝服
Fully 39 of these we deem unredeemable no votes.

772
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,280
他们憎恶黑人
The kind that hates niggers,

773
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,470
憎恨上帝创造了黑人
hates God for making niggers.

774
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,800
上天会对他们的灵魂失望的
The Good Lord on High would despair of their souls.

775
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,870
感谢你的简短解释  比尔博先生
Thank you for that pithy explanation, Mr. Bilbo.

776
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,980
我们已经抛弃这39名被邪恶附身的灵魂
We've abandoned these 39 to the Devil that possesses them.

777
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,000
我们一直在动员
The remaining lame ducks,

778
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,940
其他即将卸职的官员

T-tax collector for the Western Reserve, it

787
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,830
收入颇丰
Th-that pays handsomely.

788
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,150
不要只盯着高层
Don't just reach for the highest branches,

789
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,560
他们是墙头草
they sway in every breeze.

790
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,360
要我看  马尔斯顿的助理港口稽查员  有戏
Assistant Port Inspector of Marlston looks like the ticket to me.

791
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:09,530
船让我恶心
Uh, boats, they-they make me sick.

792
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,000
那就站在码头上
So just stand on the dock.

793
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,520
让助理港口稽查员饿饿肚子

加上格瑞勒的弃权票
Plus Graylor's abstention.

797
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,020
积少成多  霍金斯得了什么位子
- From tiny acorns and so on. - What'd Hawkins get?

He's selling himself cheap, ain't he?

800
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,100
没错  一个初当议员  搞不定改选的人
Aye, he wanted tax collector of the Western Reserve,

801
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,250
想当西部保留地的收税员
a first-term congressman who couldn't manage reelection,

802
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,830
我觉得不合适  他们把价压到所长
I felt it unseemly and they bargained him down to Postmaster.

803
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,670
把任命分散进行
Scatter 'em over several

804
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,060
以免引人注意
rounds of appointments, so no one notices,

805
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,140
事成后请烧掉账目
and burn this ledger, please, after you're done.

806
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,240
到了我的共和观点受洗之时了
Time for my public opinion bath.

807
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,880
不然让他们也加入吧
Might as well let 'em in.

808
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,450
埃利斯先生的7票  还差13票
Seven yeses with Mr. Ellis. Thirteen to go.

809
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,190
最后一项  一个荒谬但
One last item, an absurdity, but

810
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,840
我的伙伴说代表中
My associates report that among the Representatives,

811
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,290
流传着一个奇异的传闻
a fantastical rumor's bruited about,

812
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,640
你让老眼昏花的普雷斯顿・布莱尔
which I immediately disavowed,

813
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,040
去里士满邀请杰夫・戴维斯
that you'd allowed bleary

814
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,090
派行政长官
old Preston Blair to sojourn to Richmond

815
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,710
到华盛顿来和平谈判
to invite Jeff Davis to send

816
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,520
我即刻否认了
commissioners up to Washington with a peace plan.

817
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,860
我自然跟他们说你绝不会那么做
I, of course, told them you would never..

818
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,760
没询问我  你不会那么做的
Not without consulting me, you wouldn't

819
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,200
因为你又究竟为何那么做呢
Because why on earth would you?

820
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:03,030
不胜感激
Much obliged.

821
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,510
你为何不咨询我的意见  我可是国务卿
Why wasn't I consulted?! I'm Secretary of State!

822
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:16,940
你非正式地派出一个反动的老糊涂过去
You You-you informally send a reactionary dottard to

823
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,560
等特使团抵达后
What will happen, do you imagine,

824
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,440
你想象过会如何吗
when these peace commissioners arrive?

825
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,660
我们会听听他们的要求  太妙了
- We'll hear 'em out. - Oh, splendid!

826
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,250
然后民主党员
And next the Democrats

827
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,160
会请他们
will invite 'em up to hearings on the Hill,

828
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,660
和新闻媒体到国会山参加听证会
and the newspapers, well, the newspapers

829
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,380
媒体还会询问
the newspapers will ask

830
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,500
既然他们是来求和的  为何在奴隶制的问题上
why risk enraging the Confederacy over the issue of slavery

831
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,010
冒激怒南部邦联的险
when they're here to make peace?

832
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:37,930
不止保守派共和党人会加入他们
We'll lose every Democrat we've got,

833
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,150
我们还会失去已有民主党员的支持
more than likely conservative

834
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,220
而我们所有的努力
Republicans will join 'em, and all our work,

835
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,600
一切赢得投票的基础
all our preparing the ground for the vote,

836
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,830
至此烟消云散
laid waste, for naught.

837
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,100
如果我们听取这些人的话
The Blairs have promised support

838
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,920
布莱尔家族答应会支持修正案
for the amendment if we listen to these people.

839
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:53,820
布莱尔家族答应了吗
Oh, the Blairs promise, do they?

840
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,770
那些代表的要求
You think they'll keep their

841
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,180
一定是保留奴隶制
promise once we have heard these delegates

842
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,170
而你还指望
and refused them? Which we will have to do,

843
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,670
我们拒绝这些代表的要求后
since their proposal most

844
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,830
他们还信守承诺吗
certainly will be predicated on keeping their slaves!

845
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,370
如果走漏了风声说我拒绝停战
What hope for any Democratic votes, William,

846
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:08,990
那民主党的选票会怎么样  威廉
if word gets out that I've refused a chance to end the war?

847
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:13,890
你认为世上有不透风的墙吗  华盛顿会有吗
You think word won't get out? In Washington?

848
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,930
要么通过这个修正案  要么停战
It's either the amendment or this Confederate peace,

849
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,450
鱼和熊掌不可兼得
you cannot have both.

850
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:23,180
你若能窥视时间的种子
If you can look into the seeds of time,

851
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,130
能预知哪一颗能长出金黄的稻麦
and say which grain will grow and which will not,

852
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,870
那么对我说
speak then to me

853
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:29,430
灾难  这真是场灾难
Oh, disaster. This is a disaster!

854
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,620
时间会说明一切的  威廉
Time is a great thickener of things, William.

855
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,530
是啊  我也觉得
Yes, I suppose it is.

856
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,400
我都不知道你说这些干什么
Actually I have no idea what you mean by that.

857
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,790
给我弄13张赞成票
Get me thirteen votes.

858
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,460
里士满的家伙还没到呢
Them fellers from Richmond ain't here yet.

859
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,930
美军总部  弗吉尼亚州  1月12日

860
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,700
你在波士顿征了一半的人当兵
You drafted half the men in Boston!

861
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,290
他们的家人会怎么看待我
What do you think their families think about me?

862
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,750
他们没有对我扔东西吐口水
The only reason they don't throw things and spit on me

863
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:14,120
只是因为你受人爱戴
is 'cause you're so popular.

864
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:18,270
我无法专心学习英国商业法
I can't concentrate on British mercantile law,

865
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,780
我不关心什么英国商业法
I don't care about British mercantile law.

866
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:24,160
我都不想成为律师
I might not even want to be a lawyer.

867
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,310
这是个铁饭碗
It's a sturdy profession,

868
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,020
还能让你成为有用之人
and a useful one.

869
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:34,580
我现在就想成为有用的人  不是等以后
Yes, and I want to be useful, but now, not afterwards!

870
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,420
我可不戴这个  斯莱德先生
I ain't wearing them things, Mr. Slade,

871
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,500
他们从来不搭
they never fit right.

872
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,910
太太想让你戴上它们  别想丢下它
The Mrs. will have you wear 'em. Don't think about leaving 'em.

873
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,290
你在推脱  这是你最喜欢的手段
You're delaying, that's your favorite tactic.

874
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,130
你嘴上不说
You won't tell me no,

875
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:46,030
但是战争一个月内就会结束  你知道的
but the war will be over in a month, and you know it will!

876
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,610
我觉得预言本身
I've found that prophesying

877
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:53,020
往往就是最难被预言的事情
is one of life's less prophet-able occupations.

878
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,970
为什么有的黑奴比其他的贵
Why do some slaves cost more than others?

879
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,460
那些还年轻健康的
Ah, if they're still young and healthy,

880
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,640
或者能怀孕的女人  就贵一些
if the women can still conceive, they'll pay more.

881
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:02,670
把它放回盒子里去  小坏蛋
Put 'em back in the box, you scoundrel.

882
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,200
我们后天要还到
We'll return them to

883
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,250
加德纳先生的工作室去
Mr. Gardner's studio day after next.

884
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,940
小心一点
Be careful with 'em, now.

885
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:13,230
这手套就不该造出来
These things should've stayed on the calf.

886
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,120
斯莱德先生  您还是奴隶时
When you were a slave, Mr. Slade,

887
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,450
有人打你吗
did they beat you?

888
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,330
我生下来就是自由人
I was born a free man.

889
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,230
有人打我我会立刻还手的
Nobody beat me except I beat them right back.

890
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,780
林肯先生  你能跟我来吗
Mr. Lincoln, could you come with me

891
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,790
凯克莉女士曾是奴隶
Mrs. Keckley was a slave.

892
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,160
问问她被打过吗
Ask her if she was beaten.

893
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,020
你被打过吗  泰德
- Were you? - Tad!

894
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,260
我比你还小时被火铲打过
I was beaten with a fire shovel when I was younger than you.

895
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,640
您该去找林肯太太
You should go to Mrs. Lincoln.

896
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,990
她在威利的房间
She's in Willie's room.

897
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,050
她从不去那里
She never goes in there.

898
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,780
迎接队列已经在门口站好了
The reception line is already stretching out the door.

899
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,730
这地方15岁以上65岁以下
See, I'll be the only man over fifteen and under sixty-five

900
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,000
没穿军装的就只有我了
in this whole place not in uniform.

901
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,450
我不到15岁
I'm under fifteen.

902
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,610
我头很疼
My head hurts so.

903
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,340
威利死的那晚  我祈求一同死去
I prayed for death the night Willie died.

904
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,480
头痛让我知道我没能如愿
The headaches are how I know I didn't get my wish.

905
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,420
如何才能从白天熬到黑夜
How to endure the long afternoon that go deep into the night.

906
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:33,520
我知道
I know.

907
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,000
如何才能不去想他  我怎么做得到
Trying not to think about him. How will I manage?

908
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,140
总能做到的  能做到
- Somehow you will. -Somehow.

909
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:44,050
总能做到的  能做到的
Somehow. Somehow. Somehow

910
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,160
每次派对  每次
Every party, every

911
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,720
在这房子的四年里时刻在谴责我们
Four years more in this terrible house reproaching us.

912
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:02,000
他病得很厉害
He was a very sick little boy.

913
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,690
我们应该取消那个招待会  不是吗
We should've cancelled that reception, shouldn't we?

914
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,650
我们不知道他病得多重  我知道
- We didn't know how sick he was. - I knew, I knew

915
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:11,150
那晚我亲眼看到他奄奄一息
I saw that night he was dying.

916
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,810
三年前  战事正不断升级
Three years ago, the war was going so badly,

917
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,090
我们必须抛开情感强行振作
and we had to put on a face.

918
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,690
我看着威利死去  玛丽
- But I saw Willie was dying. - Mary.

919
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,120
我就这么眼睁睁看着  听我说
- I saw him. - Listen.

920
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:27,360
这对你来说很难
It's too hard.

921
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,780
太难了
Too hard.

922
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:51,870
招待会  1月15日

923
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,670
她只有10尺远
She's just ten feet yonder.

924
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,750
我可不想丢了饭碗
I'd like to keep my job.

925
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,770
萨姆纳议员  好久不见
Senator Sumner, it has been much too long.

926
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,030
您真是美艳动人
Oh, who can look on that celestial face and

927
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:07,620
这位是詹姆斯・阿什利  女士
- And - James Ashley, ma'am,

928
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:09,920
感谢上苍  感谢上苍 我们见过几次
We've met several times. Praise Heavens, praise Heavens,

929
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,220
我还以为今晚会十分无趣呢
just when I had abandoned hope of amusement,

930
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,630
这不是众议院筹款委员会主席吗
It's the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee!

931
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:15,950
林肯太太
Mrs. Lincoln.

932
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:18,510
请称呼我第一夫人
Madame President if you please.

933
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:23,540
千万别派下属委员会来调查我
Oh, don't convene another subcommittee to investigate me, sir!

934
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,130
我开玩笑呢
I'm teasing!

935
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,350
笑一个  韦德议员
Smile, Senator Wade.

936
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,450
我这就是在笑呢  林肯太太
I believe I am smiling, Mrs. Lincoln.

937
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:30,390
只要您家的财务没什么问题  夫人
As long as your household accounts are in order, Madame,

938
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,880
我们就不需要调查它们
we'll have no need to investigate them.

939
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,920
你一直都对我家的账本
You have always taken such a lively,

940
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,860
有着强烈的检察兴趣
even prosecutorial interest in my household accounts.

941
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,300
那是因为您家的账务让人感兴趣
Your household accounts have always been so interesting.

942
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,850
谢谢  这倒是真的
Yes, thank you, it's true,

943
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,150
摆平农务和伙食的账务可真是奇迹
the miracles I have wrought out of fertilizer bills and cutlery invoices,

944
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,570
不过我必须做到
but I had to!

945
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,040
四年前  当我和总统到这里时
Four years ago, when the president and I arrived,

946
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,750
这里跟猪窝一样
this was pure pigsty.

947
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:58,660
土耳其地毯上尽是烟草污渍
Tobacco stains in the turkey carpets.

948
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:02,030
天花板上长着月光般泛绿的蘑菇
Mushrooms, green as the moon, sprouting from the ceilings!

949
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,430
还有少得可怜的维护预算
And a pauper's pittance allotted for improvements.

950
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,410
似乎你们委员会同全华盛顿一起
As if your committee joined with all of Washington awaiting,

951
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:14,180
在这个你们期待成为我们舒适归宿的肮脏小窝里
in what you anticipated would be our comfort in squalor,

952
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:18,610
等着证明我们是来自草原的原始人
further proove that my husband and I were prairie primitives,

953
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,710
因人民选择的错误和民主制度的瑕疵
unsuited to the position to which an error of the people,

954
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:23,930
被推举到一个我们配不上的高位
a flaw in the democratic process, had elevated us.

955
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,290
过去就让它过去吧  新的一年到了
The past is the past, it's a new year now,

956
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:31,360
听说我们相处得还不错
and we are all getting along, or so they tell me.

957
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,720
我们要同心协力
I gather we are working together!

958
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:35,830
白宫和其他机构
The White House and the other House,

959
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,530
共同出谋划策
hatching little plans together.

960
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:38,360
母亲  怎么了
- Mother? - What?

961
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,150
人都堵在这了
You're creating a bottleneck.

962
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,690
我耽搁您太久了
Oh, I'm detaining you.

963
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,300
或者说  我耽搁您身后的人们太久了
And more importantly, the people behind you.

964
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:49,600
人民爱戴我的丈夫
How the people love my husband,

965
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:54,180
他们成群结队在公众日来看他
they flock to see him by their thousands on public days!

966
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:56,770
他们永远不会像爱他一样爱您
They will never love you the way they love him.

967
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,100
知道这些您一定很难受
How difficult it must be for you to know that.

968
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,380
但是记住这些也很重要
And yet how important to remember it.

969
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
明天的辩论中轮到我们发言
Since we have the floor next in the debate,

970
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,420
我建议你或许
I thought I'd suggest you might

971
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:22,730
缓和一下你的脾气
temper your contributions

972
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:26,010
免得吓到了保守派的朋友们
so as not to frighten our conservative friends?

973
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:30,090
阿什利说你在收买边缘的民主党人
Ashley insists you're ensuring approval by dispensing patronage

974
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,150
来保证修正案通过
to otherwise undeserving Democrats.

975
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,370
如果你要用土地挪用
I can't ensure a single damn thing

976
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,250
革命审判和惩罚
if you scare the whole House

977
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:38,360
吓唬整个议会的话
with talk of land appropriations,

978
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,620
我就什么都保证不了了
revolutionary tribunals, punitive

979
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:44,660
等战争结束  我想争取完全的平等
When the war ends, I intend to push for full equality,

980
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,910
赋予黑人选举权  当然远不只如此
the Negro vote, and much more.

981
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:51,770
国会将收复每一寸叛军土地
Congress shall mandate the seizure of every foot of rebel land

982
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:54,540
和他们的所有财产
and every dollar of their property.

983
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,910
我们要用充公的财富
We'll use their confiscated wealth

984
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:00,850
去建立成千上万黑人农民阶级
to establish hundreds of thousands of free Negro farmers,

985
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,220
和武装力量去占领和转换叛徒的遗产
and at their side soldiers armed to occupy and transform the heritage of traitors.

986
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,610
我们要建立一片
We'll build up a land down there

987
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:11,750
属于自由的男女老少的自由之地
of free men and free women and free children and freedom.

988
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,900
国家要知道我们的计划
The nation needs to know that we have such plans.

989
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:20,450
这是未加修饰的战后重建计划
That's the untempered version of reconstruction.

990
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,990
跟我想的不太一样
It's not quite exactly what I intend,

991
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:32,480
我们早晚会反对彼此的政见
but we shall oppose one another in the course of time.

992
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,850
但现在我们在同一条战线  所以我请求你
Now we're working together, and I'm asking you

993
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:36,000
耐心点  对吧
for patience, I expect.

994
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,640
当人民意见不一致
When the people disagree,

995
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,360
就需要慢慢让他们
bringing them together requires going slow

996
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:40,660
能够达成一致
till they're ready to make up.

997
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,030
去他的人民
Ah, shit on the people,

998
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,640
他们要什么  他们准备怎么样
and what they want, and what they're ready for,

999
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,240
我才不管他们要什么
I don't give a goddamn about the people and what they want!

1000
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:49,690
这是一个长期为了人民的利益奋斗
This is the face of someone who has fought long and hard for the good of the people

1001
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,120
却从不关心人民的人的面庞
without caring much for any of 'em.

1002
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:55,610
我不带假发看起来更糟糕
And I look a lot worse without my wig.

1003
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,640
人民选举了我  去代表他们
The people elected me! To represent them!

1004
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,960
去领导他们  我成功领了他们  你应该试试
To lead them! And I lead! You ought to try it!

1005
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,530
我欣赏你的热情  史蒂文斯先生
I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens,

1006
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:11,750
我也试过从中牟利
and I have tried to profit from the example of it.

1007
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:16,830
如果听了你的  在萨穆特要塞战役
If I've listened to you,  I've declared every slave free

1008
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,450
打响时就宣布奴隶解放
the minute the first shell struck Fort Sumter.

1009
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:21,160
那么边境州将投向叛军
Then the border states would've gone over to the confederacy,

1010
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,770
我们将输掉战争  失去联盟
the war would've been lost and the Union along with it,

1011
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:25,840
不仅不能像我们预期那样
and instead of abolishing slavery,

1012
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,620
在两周内废除奴隶制
as we hope to do in two weeks,

1013
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,000
我们将无助地看着
we'll be watching helpless as infants as it spread

1014
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,550
美国南部分裂出去
from the American South into South America.

1015
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:35,020
你很渴望对我说这些吧
Oh God, how you have longed to say that to me.

1016
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,820
你说你信任他们
You claim you trust them.

1017
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:40,590
可你知道人民是什么样子
But you know what the people are.

1018
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,730
在白人的心里本该引导他们的灵魂
You know that the inner compass

1019
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,630
通往正义的罗盘
that should direct the soul toward justice

1020
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:50,790
已经被邪恶的奴隶制
has ossified in white men and women, north and south, unto utter uselessness

1021
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:54,390
僵化得毫无用处了
through tolerating the evil of slavery.

1022
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:57,060
白人不能容忍
White people cannot bear the thought of sharing

1023
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:59,850
与黑人共享这个国家无尽财富的想法
this country's infinite abundance with Negroes.

1024
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:05,750
我在外勘测时发现关于罗盘
A compass, I learnt when I was surveying,

1025
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:09,380
它会为你指出正北的方向
It'll point you True North from where you're standing,

1026
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:12,440
却不会指出沿途会遇到的
but it'll got no advice about the swamps

1027
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:16,170
沼泽  沙漠和深坑
and deserts and chasms that you'll encounter along the way.

1028
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,360
如果在追寻目标的途中
If in pursuit of your destination,

1029
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:20,220
你一往无前  不留心障碍困难
you plunge ahead, heedless of obstacles,

1030
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,630
除了陷入沼泽哪里也到不了
and achieve nothing more than to sink in a swamp.

1031
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,540
那么知道正北又有什么用
What's the use of knowing True North?

1032
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,580
罗伯特会恳求我们让他入伍
Robert's gonna plead with us to let him enlist.

1033
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,870
抽空跟罗比谈谈
Make time to talk to Robbie.

1034
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:55,200
你总是陪着泰德  可是泰德还小
- You only have time for Tad. - But Tad's young.

1035
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,530
罗伯特也很年轻
So is Robert.

1036
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:59,340
去从军还太年轻了
Too young for the army.

1037
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:02,410
很多比罗伯特更小的孩子都入伍了
Plenty of boys younger than Robert signing up.

1038
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,230
不准让罗比去
Don't take Robbie.

1039
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:09,920
别让我失去我的儿子
Don't let me lose my son.

1040
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:13,770
走开  我们没空
Go away! We're occupied!

1041
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,430
斯坦顿部长刚发来消息(埃德温・斯坦顿  美国战争部长)
Secretary Stanton has sent over to tell you

1042
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:20,410
半个小时前
that as of half an hour ago,

1043
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,630
对威尔明顿港的进攻开始了
the shelling of Wilmington harbor has commenced.

1044
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:30,640
在这种攻击下他们坚持不了多久
They cannot possibly maintain under this kind of an assault.

1045
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,420
特里有一万士兵围攻那个要塞
Terry's got ten thousand men surrounding the Goddamned fort,

1046
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:35,040
他怎么还没回话
Why doesn't he answer my cables?

1047
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,440
非瑟堡可大得很  埃德温
Fort Fisher is a mountain of a building, Edwin.

1048
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:37,730
是他们最大的要塞了
It's the largest fort they have, sir.

1049
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,260
每个壁垒都有22挺沿岸机枪
Twenty-two big seacoast guns on each rampart.

1050
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:41,130
过去两年他们一直在加强防御
They've been reinforcing it for the last two years.

1051
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,170
昨天开始他们一共挨了1万7千枚子弹
They've taken 17,000 shells since yesterday!

1052
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:44,370
我要听到这要塞
I want to hear that Fort fisher is ours

1053
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:47,240
和威尔明顿被攻陷的消息
and Wilmington has fallen!

1054
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,640
再发一份电报
Send another damn cable!

1055
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:51,440
问题就在他们的司令  怀丁
The problem's their commander. Whiting!

1056
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,890
他亲自指挥修建了堡垒  那玩意是他的亲儿子
He engineered the fortress himself. The damned thing's his child.

1057
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:57,730
他会拼到最后一兵一卒  不会
He'll defend it till his every last man is gone. He is not thinking

1058
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,420
滚出来  你这臭老鼠
Come on out, you old rat!

1059
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,230
那就是
That's what

1060
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,660
1776年伊森・艾伦对
That' what Ethan Allen called

1061
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:09,310
蒂康德罗格要塞的指挥官说的话
to the commander of Fort Ticonderogain in 1776.

1062
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:10,250
滚出来  你这臭老鼠
Come on out, you old rat!

1063
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,920
因为蒂康德罗格里
Aah, 'course there were only

1064
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,340
只有40多个英国兵了
forty odd redcoats at Ticonderoga.

1065
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,020
有一个关于伊森・艾伦的故事
But there is one Ethan Allen story that

1066
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,340
不  我很喜欢
- No! - I'm very partial to.

1067
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,120
你又要讲故事了
No, you're going to tell a story!

1068
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,000
真不敢相信
I don't believe that I can bear

1069
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,800
在这种时候我还要忍受你的另一个故事
to listen to another one of your stories right now!

1070
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:32,800
我要看侧线攻击亚历山大市的计划
I need the B&O sideyard schedules for Alexandria!

1071
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,440
我今天早上就说过了
I asked for them this morning!

1072
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,970
在独立战争偃旗息鼓时
It was right after the Revolution,

1073
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:41,090
在和平女神降临美利坚大地后
right after peace had been concluded,

1074
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:46,300
伊森・艾伦去了伦敦和国王处理
Ethan Allen went to London to help

1075
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,250
我们新生国家的相关事宜
our new country conduct its business with the king.

1076
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:53,280
不管到哪里英国人总嘲笑我们粗野
The English sneered at how rough we are,

1077
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,790
鲁莽和愚笨之类的
and rude and simple-minded and on like that,

1078
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,050
有一天他被邀请
everywhere he went, till one day he was

1079
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,810
去一个英国贵族的别墅
invited to the townhouse of a great English lord.

1080
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:06,080
吃过晚餐  喝过饮料
Dinner was served, beverages imbibed,

1081
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:09,230
时间慢慢过去
time passed, as happens, and

1082
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,640
艾伦先生想上厕所
Mr. Allen found he needed the privy.

1083
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:16,140
于是有人带他去洗手间  他十分感激
He was grateful to be directed thence.

1084
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:21,660
或者说是十分爽
Relieved, you might say.

1085
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:27,720
可艾伦先生发现厕所门口
Now, Mr. Allen discovered on entering the water closet

1086
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:31,420
唯一的装饰品居然是
that the only decoration therein was a

1087
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,830
乔治・华盛顿的雕像
a portrait of George Washington.

1088
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:40,000
伊森・艾伦方便完之后
Ethan Allen done what he came to do,

1089
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:43,060
回到了会客厅
and returned to the drawing room.

1090
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,270
主人和其他客人都很失望
His host and the others were disappointed

1091
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:47,290
因为他没有提到华盛顿的雕像
when he didn't mention Washington's portrait.

1092
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,070
终于主人忍不住了
And finally His Lordship couldn't resist,

1093
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,070
他问艾伦先生有没有注意到
and asked Mr. Allen had he noticed it,

1094
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,740
华盛顿的头像
the picture of Washington.

1095
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,500
他看到了
He had.

1096
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,680
那么他觉得那位置怎么样
What did he think of its placement,

1097
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,470
放在那里对艾伦先生来说是否合适
did it seem appropriately located to Mr. Allen?

1098
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,070
艾伦先生说很合适
Mr. Allen said it did.

1099
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:03,770
主人很吃惊  很合适吗
His host was astounded! Appropriate?

1100
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:07,500
乔治・华盛顿的肖像放在厕所里
George Washington's likeness in a water closet?

1101
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:09,280
是的  艾伦说道
Yes, said Mr. Allen,

1102
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,880
它在那里很起作用
where it'll do good service.

1103
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,020
没有什么比华盛顿的目光更能
The whole world knows nothing'll make an Englishman shit

1104
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:16,440
让英国人尿裤子了
quicker than the sight of George Washington.

1105
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:22,270
我喜欢这个故事
I love that story.

1106
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:50,500
非瑟堡是我们的了
Fort Fisher is ours.

1107
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,410
我们攻下来了
We're taken the port.

1108
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:52,940
那威尔明顿呢
And Wilmington?

1109
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,360
要塞攻下来了
We're taken the fort,

1110
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,950
威尔明顿市还没有投降
but the city of Wilmington has not surrendered.

1111
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:01,230
伤亡多少
How many casualties?

1112
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:13,370
(纽约先驱论坛报
威尔明顿的沦陷)

1113
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,560
损失很严重
Heavy losses.

1114
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,710
还在不断增多
And more to come.

1115
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,290
举国悲痛
Sours the national mood.

1116
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,810
这或许足够让他气馁
That might suffice to discourage him.

1117
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:19,990
放弃这个吗
To bring this down?

1118
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,820
不太可能  这是生死厮杀
Not in a fight like this. This is to the death.

1119
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,350
真可怕
It's gruesome!

1120
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,850
你在绝望还是想偷懒
Are you despairing, or merely lazy?

1121
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,510
这场战争是为美利坚合众国而打响
This fight is for The united States of America.

1122
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:31,970
没什么足够
Nothing suffices

1123
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:33,640
一个谣言  不可能
A rumor? Nothing!

1124
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:36,610
他们可没偷懒  他们在收买投票
They're not lazy. They're busily buying votes!

1125
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:38,150
而我们还想着靠举国悲痛来赢吗
While we hope to be saved by the national mood?!

1126
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:39,350
趁着还有救  等史蒂文斯下次发言
Before this blood is dry, when Stevens next takes the floor,

1127
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,030
嘲讽他  你很擅长这个
taunt him. You excel at that.

1128
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:54,960
让他说出他内心深处的话
Get him to proclaim what we all know he believes in his coal-colored heart:

1129
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:57,760
这场投票是为了抬高黑人
that this vote is meant to set the black race on high,

1130
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,140
是为了黑化美国
to niggerate America.

1131
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:01,590
乔治  不要气馁
George, please. Stay on course.

1132
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,810
想办法激怒史蒂文斯
Bring Stevens to full froth.

1133
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,280
我能确保
I can ensure that every

1134
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,330
从路易斯维尔到旧金山的记者
newspaperman from Louisville to San Francisco

1135
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,270
都会来见证和报道的
will be here to witness it and print it.

1136
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,890
下面有请优雅的绅士
The floor belongs to the mellifluent gentleman

1137
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:18,540
来自肯塔基的乔治・伊曼
from Kentucky, Mr. George Yeaman.

1138
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:26,620
谢谢  科尔法议长
I thank you, Speaker Colfax.

1139
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:38,250
尽管  我对奴隶制深恶痛绝
Although I'm disgusted by slavery

1140
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:44,590
站在沉痛悲哀的今天
I rise on this sad and solemn day.

1141
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,190
我要说我反对这项修正案
to announce that I'm opposed to the amendment.

1142
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:57,820
我们要考虑如果40万有色人种
We must consider what will become of colored folk

1143
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,870
一瞬间全部获得自由会怎么样
if four million are in one instant set free.

1144
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:03,070
他们就自由了  乔治
They'll be free, George.

1145
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,080
就是这样
That's what'll become of them!

1146
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:09,090
想想如果伊曼先生倒戈了该多妙
Think how splendid if Mr. Yeaman switched.

1147
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,150
公开反对我们  他不会倒戈了
Too publicly against us. He can't change course now.

1148
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:15,350
不用点特殊办法是不行
Not for some miserable little job anyways.

1149
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:20,150
我们将被迫解放赋予色人种政治权利
We will be forced to enfranchise the men of the colored race.

1150
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:23,510
因为不这样做是没有人性的
It would be inhuman not to!

1151
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:27,320
可是我们有谁想给黑鬼选举权
Who among us is prepared to give Negroes the vote?

1152
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,520
那接下来又是什么
What shall follow upon that?

1153
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,720
全社会共享政治权利吗
Universal enfranchisement?

1154
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,570
女性也获得投票权吗
Votes for women?

1155
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:52,550
这不是俄亥俄  米勒斯堡的
Bless my eyes, if it isn't the Post Master

1156
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,290
邮政局长吗
of Millersburg Ohio!

1157
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:58,820
莱克勒克先生认为在道义上
Mr. LeClerk felt honor-bound to

1158
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:01,430
有责任告诉我们你的无耻背叛
inform us of your disgusting betrayal.

1159
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:04,170
你出卖了灵魂
Your prostitution.

1160
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,480
是吗  霍金斯局长
Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins?

1161
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:10,880
你的贞操一文不值吗
Is your maidenly virtue for sale?

1162
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:16,540
如果我的邻居知道我投票支持黑奴自由
If my neighbors hear that I voted yes for nigger freedom

1163
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:18,070
而不是和平  他们会杀了我的
and no to peace, they will kill me.

1164
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,790
在商言商  你的人不会只因有谈和的传言
A deal is a deal and you men know better than to piss your pants

1165
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,440
就要取你的项上人头的
just because there's talk about peace talks.

1166
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:23,020
我会找到新工作的
Look, I'll find another job.

1167
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,390
我的邻居在纳什维尔
My neighbors in Nashville,

1168
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:26,040
他们知道我效忠联邦
they found out I was loyal to the Union,

1169
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,600
还拿刀子想阉我
they came after me with gelding knives!

1170
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:29,320
什么工作都行  别走错路了  克莱・霍金斯
- Any other job! - You do right, Clay Hawkins

1171
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,450
我也不想走错  还能大赚一笔
- I want to do right! - and make yourself some money in the bargain

1172
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,410
可我没有勇气
But I got no courage!

1173
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:35,740
等等  你是想当西部保留地的税务官
Wait!! You wanted, what was it, tax man for the Western Reserve,

1174
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,240
还是想拥有整个俄亥俄都行  只要
hell you can have the whole state of Ohio if you

1175
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:38,820
该死
Aw, crap.

1176
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:43,970
11票
Eleven votes?!

1177
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,090
两天前还有12票  怎么回事
Two days ago we had twelve! What happened?

1178
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:47,260
里士满变节了
There are defections in the Richmond

1179
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:48,360
是那个流言吗
It's the goddamned rumors regarding

1180
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,180
是的  和谈的传言  无稽之谈
- Yes! The peace offer! - Groundless.

1181
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,800
我早说过了  但是谣言还是不断
- I told you that. - And yet the rumors persist.

1182
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:52,910
这会毁了我们
They are ruining us.

1183
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:57,010
在剩下的这些不怎么可靠的代表中
Among the few remaining representatives who seem remotely plausible

1184
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:59,460
有些人开始表现出立场摇摆
there is a perceptible increase in resistance.

1185
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:01,210
该死
Resistance, hell!

1186
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,260
辛纳曼鲍勃・霍利斯特
Thingamabob Hollister,

1187
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:04,310
来自印第安纳的民主党人
Dem from Indiana?

1188
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,350
我接近他的时候  那婊子差点杀了我
I approached him, the sumbitch near to murdered me!

1189
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,980
你可能太过强硬
Perhaps you push too hard.

1190
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:35,950
我一点也没有
I push nobody.

1191
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,060
也许我们需要后援
Perhaps we need reinforcements.

1192
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:41,700
如果杰夫・戴维斯要来和谈
If Jeff Davis wants to cease hostilities,

1193
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,140
还有谁真的关心解放黑奴
who do you think'll give a genuine solid shit to free slaves?

1194
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,270
回去工作吧
Get back to it.

1195
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:49,010
先生们  再会
And gentlemen, good day.

1196
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:52,140
我们死路一条了
We are at an impasse.

1197
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:54,560
让林肯去公开地否认谣言
Tell Lincoln to deny the rumors. Publicly.

1198
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:56,030
你指望我们干什么
Tell us what you expect of us.

1199
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:57,870
我指望你们去工作
I expect you to do your work.

1200
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,360
要有健全的感觉和品味
And to have sufficient sense and taste

1201
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,450
不要试图对总统指手画脚
not to presume to instruct the President.

1202
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,250
或是对我
Or me.

1203
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:06,960
到底有没有和谈
Is there a Confederate offer or not?

1204
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,620
尤里西斯・格兰特(美军总指挥官)

1205
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:23,890
先生们
Gentlemen

1206
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:29,650
我建议你们在把提议交给总统前
I suggest you work some changes to your proposal

1207
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:31,090
能够做一些修改
before you give it to the President.

1208
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,500
我们急着返回华盛顿
We're eager to be on our way to Washington.

1209
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,540
林肯先生派你来就是告诉我们这些的吗
Did Mr. Lincoln tell you to tell us this?

1210
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,240
上面说  为两国谋求和平
It says securing peace for our two countries.

1211
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,450
后文也是这样
And it goes on like that.

1212
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,270
不知道你是说
I don't know what you

1213
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:44,370
只有一个国家
There's just one country.

1214
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,060
而你和我  我们都是这个国家的公民
And you and I, we're citizens of that country.

1215
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,970
我为了从武装叛军手中保卫她而战
I'm fighting to protect it from armed rebels.

1216
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:51,780
也就是你们
From you.

1217
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:54,570
布莱尔先生告诉我们
Mr. Blair, he told us,

1218
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:57,460
他跟戴维斯总统说我们
he told President Davis we were

1219
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:00,180
公民普雷斯顿・布莱尔可以随意信口开河
A private citizen like Preston Blair can say what he pleases

1220
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:02,510
因为他没有任何权利
since he has no authority over anything.

1221
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,810
如果想要和林肯总统和谈
If you want to discuss peace with President Lincoln,

1222
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,470
就得修改它
consider revisions.

1223
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:13,970
如果我们不以交战两国的名义谈论停战
If we're not to discuss a truce between warring nations,

1224
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,960
那么我们到底在讨论什么
what in heaven's name can we discuss?

1225
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,940
投降的条件
Terms of surrender.

1226
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,220
美国军事办公室电报处
Office United States Military Telegraph War Dept.

1227
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:26,080
致亚伯拉罕・林肯
For Abraham Lincoln,

1228
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:29,820
美国总统  1865年1月20日
President of the United States, January 20, 1865.

1229
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:32,190
我将此消息秘密送出
I will state confidentially that I am convinced,

1230
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:34,580
在和对方代表谈判后
upon conversation with these Commissioners,

1231
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:38,070
我认为他们的目的友好  意图诚挚
that their intentions are good and their desire sincere

1232
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:39,910
旨在恢复和平与联合
to restore peace and union.

1233
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:41,590
我恐怕他们现在
I fear now their going back,

1234
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:44,050
若不带回我方高层
without any expression of interest

1235
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:45,720
意图再次和谈的兴趣
from anyone in authority,

1236
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,460
会对林肯先生影响很不好
Mr. Lincoln will have a bad influence.

1237
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:53,140
很抱歉我没能为您
I will be sorry should it prove impossible for you

1238
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:55,360
安排与他们会面
to have an interview with them.

1239
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:57,830
等待您的指示
I am awaiting your instructions.

1240
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:04,320
尤利西斯・格兰特  美军中将
U.S. Grant, Lieutenant General Commanding Armies United States.

1241
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:11,180
四年的战争  近60万人丧生
After four years of war and near 600,000 lives lost,

1242
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:14,370
他相信我们现在就能停战
he believes we can end this war now.

1243
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,000
我对他信任有加
My trust in him is marrow deep.

1244
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,840
你能让代表来华盛顿
You could bring the delegates to Washington.

1245
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,340
作为交换让南方立刻投降
In exchange for the South's immediate surrender,

1246
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,760
我们向他们保证修正案不会通过
we could promise them the amendment's defeat.

1247
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:38,470
他们会同意  你觉得呢
They'd agree, don't you think?

1248
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:41,310
那么我们在这周就能停止战争
We'd end the war. This week.

1249
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:47,850
如果你不想这样  除非你能
Or if you could manage, without seeming to do it, to.

1250
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,750
和谈代表团可能会
The peace delegation might encounter delays

1251
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,730
在詹姆斯河附近耽搁一阵子
as they travel up the James River.

1252
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,120
尤其是威尔明顿还在交战
Particularly with the fighting around Wilmington.

1253
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:06,830
10天时间之内
Within ten days time,

1254
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:09,740
我们或许可以让第13修正案通过
we might pass the Thirteenth Amendment.

1255
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,720
一名16岁的男孩
Here's a sixteen year old boy.

1256
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:56,560
他将要被吊死
They're gonna hang him.

1257
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,420
他和第15  印第安纳骑兵队一起
He was with the 15th Indiana Calvary

1258
01:12:58,420 --> 01:12:59,620
在伯弗附近
near Beaufort,

1259
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:02,390
他似乎打断了马腿想当逃兵
seems he lamed his horse to avoid battle.

1260
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:05,160
如果我赦免他
I don't think even Stanton would complain

1261
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,880
我想连斯坦顿都不会抱怨的
if I pardoned him,

1262
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,370
你觉得斯坦顿会说什么吗
You think Stanton would complain?

1263
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,820
我不知道  先生  我不知道您是谁
I don't know, sir, I don't know who you're, uh

1264
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:12,600
现在几点了
What time is it?

1265
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,250
早上3点40分
It's three forty in the morning.

1266
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:17,110
别让他再赦免逃兵了
Don't let him pardon any more deserters

1267
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:20,200
斯坦顿先生认为您赦免了太多了
Aah, Mr. Stanton thinks you pardon too many.

1268
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:22,100
他对这一点很恼火
He's generally apoplectic on the subject.

1269
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,270
他不应该那样做
He oughtn't to have done that,

1270
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,620
把马弄残废  太残忍了
crippled his horse, that was cruel,

1271
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,520
但也不能就这么吊死一个16岁的男孩吧
but you don't just hang a sixteen year old boy for that.

1272
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:27,400
问问那匹马怎么想
Ask the horse what he thinks.

1273
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,820
没有几个16岁的男孩能活下来 因为残忍
For cruelty. There'd be no sixteen year old boys left.

1274
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:50,770
格兰特想要我
Grant wants me to

1275
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:52,980
让南方叛党的代表团来华盛顿
bring the secesh delegates to Washington.

1276
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:58,840
真有南方人的代表吗
So there are secesh delegates?

1277
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:00,830
他只是害怕了而已
He was afraid, that's all it was.

1278
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,300
我也不在乎绞死一个怯战的男孩
I don't care to hang a boy for being frightened, either.

1279
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,910
但这么做有什么好处呢
What good would it do him?

1280
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:24,060
战争就要结束了  不是吗
War's nearly done, ain't that so?

1281
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:29,780
多一具尸体有什么意义呢
What use one more corpse?

1282
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,140
多几具尸体又有什么意义呢
Any more corpses?

1283
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:44,050
要我陪您吗
Do you need company?

1284
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,780
这种时候  我一个人就行
In times like this, I'm best alone.

1285
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:30,680
致陆军总司令尤利西斯・格兰特  锡蒂波因特
Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, City Point.

1286
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,050
我极有诚意的读完您的电报
I have read your words with interest.

1287
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:36,990
不论我如何应对里士满官员来访一事
I ask that, regardless of any action I take

1288
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,500
我要求您
in the matter of the visit of the Richmond commissioners,

1289
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:46,370
请您务必让军队
you maintain among your troops military preparedness for battle,

1290
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,650
一如既往地时刻保持备战状态
as you have done until now.

1291
01:15:55,640 --> 01:16:00,440
请桑德斯上尉带该特使团前来华盛顿与我商谈
Have Captain Saunders convey the commissioners to me here in Washington.

1292
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:04,490
亚伯拉罕・林肯再加上日期  好的  先生
- A. Lincoln and the date. - Yes sir.

1293
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:10,460
现在就发吗  先生
Shall I transmit, sir?

1294
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,750
我们能决定自己的出生吗
You think we choose to be born?

1295
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,150
我觉得不能
I don't suppose so.

1296
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,270
我们是不是生逢其时
Are we fitted to the times we're born into?

1297
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:32,430
我不知道自己是不是
Well, I don't know about myself.

1298
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:36,500
但您也许是的  先生
You may be sir. Fitted.

1299
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:42,670
你是怎么想的
What do you reckon?

1300
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,540
我是名工程师
Well, I'm an engineer.

1301
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:54,660
这个时代有机械  但是没有人天生就适合
I reckon there's machinery but No one's done the fitting.

1302
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,090
你是名工程师
You're an engineer.

1303
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:03,370
那一定知道欧几里得的定理和公理
You must know Euclid's axioms and common notions.

1304
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,270
我在学校学过  但是
I must've in school, but

1305
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,370
我受过的学校教育不多
I never had much of schooling,

1306
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:09,910
但是在一本借到的旧书上
but I read Euclid,

1307
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:11,770
读过欧几里得
in an old book I borrowed.

1308
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:15,190
这里没有理解住多少  但是
Little enough ever found its way in here, but

1309
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:17,210
一旦学会就永远都记得
once learnt it stayed learnt.

1310
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:23,320
欧几里得的第一条公理就是
Euclid's first common notion is this:

1311
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:28,660
等于同量的量彼此相等
Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.

1312
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:33,130
这是数理的规则
That's a rule of mathematical reasoning.

1313
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:35,120
它是对的  因为适用
It's true because it works.

1314
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,950
能而且永远适用
Has done and always will do.

1315
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:42,560
在书里
In his book, hmm

1316
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:45,910
欧几里得称此为自证
Euclid says this is self-evident.

1317
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:52,540
看到吗  就算是两千年前的数理定律
D'you see, there it is, even in that two thousand year old book of mechanical law:

1318
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:57,610
也认为  等于同量的量彼此相等这个道理
it is a self evident truth that things which are equal to the same thing

1319
01:17:57,730 --> 01:17:58,910
是不证自明的
are equal to each other.

1320
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:04,690
我们生而平等
We begin with equality.

1321
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,050
这才是世界的起源  不是吗
That's the origin, isn't it?

1322
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,020
这种平等  我们称之为  公平
That balance, that's that's fairness.

1323
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:16,960
称之为正义
That's justice.

1324
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:28,210
请把最后一句念给我听
Just read me back the last sentence of that telegram, please.

1325
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:33,270
请桑德斯上尉带该特使团前来华盛顿与我商谈
Have Captain Saunders convey the commissioners to me here in Washington.

1326
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:35,860
做点小改动吧  山姆
A slight emendation if you would, Sam.

1327
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:41,070
请桑德斯上尉带领该特使团
Have Captain Saunders convey the gentlemen

1328
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:42,740
到达弗吉尼亚州的汉普顿港群
aboard the River Queen

1329
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,990
登上河流女王号
as far as Hampton Roads, Virginia,

1330
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:49,620
之后  原地等待
and there wait until

1331
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:53,810
我的后续指令
further advice from me.

1332
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,410
切勿前往华盛顿
Do not proceed to Washington.

1333
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,960
环球报  先驱报
The World, the Herald

1334
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,790
泰晤士报  纽约客  芝加哥报
and the Times, New York, Chicago,

1335
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:53,030
商业日报  甚至你家乡的小报都来了
the Journal of Commerce, even your hometown paper's here.

1336
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:53,830
万分恳请您
Say you believe

1337
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,440
告诉他们你只认可不同种族的法律地位平等
only in legal equality for all races,

1338
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:59,500
而不是种族平等
not racial quality. I beg you, sir.

1339
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:01,490
要么听我劝告
Compromise.

1340
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,570
要么以身犯险
Or you risk it all.

1341
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,610
史蒂文斯先生  我有个问题要问您
I've asked you a question, Mr. Stevens,

1342
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:28,720
也请您回答我
and you must answer me.

1343
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:32,590
您是否认为要按字面的意思
Do you or do you not hold that the precept that

1344
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,860
去理解人人生而平等
all men are created equal is meant literally?

1345
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,110
这难道不是修正案的真实目的吗
Is that not the true purpose of the amendment?

1346
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:47,000
用以实现您的终极野心  来提升
To promote your ultimate and ardent dream to elevate

1347
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:49,690
修正案的真正目的  伍德先生
The true purpose of the amendment, Mr. Wood,

1348
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,520
难道是您说的那些虚有其表
you perfectly-named,

1349
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,810
肤浅至极  繁琐不堪的东西吗
brainless, obstructive object?

1350
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:58,560
史蒂文斯先生  您一直坚持认为
Now you have always insisted, Mr. Stevens,

1351
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:03,060
黑人和我们白人是一样的
that Negroes are the same as white men are.

1352
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:05,950
修正案的真正目的
The true purpose of the amendment

1353
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:36,260
我并非肯定一切平等
I don't hold with equality in all things,

1354
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:39,270
而只是承认他们的法律地位平等
only with equality before the law and nothing more.

1355
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:43,060
不是这样  你
That's not so! You

1356
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:46,800
你是认为黑人和白人完全一样
You believe that Negroes are entirely equal to white men.

1357
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,540
你之前无数次这样表态
You've said it a thousand times

1358
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:50,230
不知羞  不知羞
For shame! For shame!

1359
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:53,540
不要再闪烁其词了  伍德议员
Stop prevaricating and answer, Representative Wood!

1360
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:56,090
我不认为人人生来一切平等
I don't hold with equality in all things,

1361
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,820
而只是承认法律面前人人平等
only with equality before the law

1362
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,450
这么多年了仅此而已
- After the decades- And nothing more!

1363
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:01,970
他在回答你的问题
He's answered your questions!

1364
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:04,390
这个修正案和种族平等没有关系
This amendment has naught to do with race equality!

1365
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:07,220
我不认为人人生来一切平等  你一直以来都坚持的观点呢
- I don't hold with equality in all things - You have long insisted, have you not

1366
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,370
只是法律面前人人平等  难道认为有色人种
- only with equality before the law - that the dusk colored race

1367
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:10,910
仅此而已  和白色人种不一样
- and nothing more. - is no different from the white one.

1368
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:14,660
想不到这老头子竟然能装到现在
Who'd ever've guessed that old nightmare capable of such control?

1369
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:16,890
说不定哪一天他就能成为一名政治家
He might make a politician someday

1370
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:19,510
我要出去会  肯克莱太太
- I need to go. - Mrs. Keykley!

1371
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,500
你这种含糊其辞的做法
Your frantic attempt to delude us now

1372
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,810
真是不配做一个议员
is unworthy of a representative.

1373
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:29,740
事实上  甚至不配做一个白人公民
It is in fact, unworthy of a white man!

1374
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:35,650
当我面前站着一个来自俄亥俄州
How can I hold that all men are created equal,

1375
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,920
臭气熏天  道德沦丧的男人
when here before me stands, stinking,

1376
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:41,910
你让我怎么相信人类的一切均为平等
the moral carcass of the gentleman from Ohio,

1377
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,930
这不就是劣等人存在的证明吗
proof that some men are inferior,

1378
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:47,620
造物主只给予了他们最低等的智慧
endowed by their Maker with dim wits,

1379
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:52,040
血管里流淌的不是鲜红炽热的鲜血
impermeable to reason with cold pallid slime

1380
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:54,920
而是冰冷呆滞的泥浆
in their veins instead of hot red blood!

1381
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:59,180
比起人类  你更像爬行动物  乔治
You are more reptile than man, George,

1382
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,550
如此的低下渺小
so low and flat

1383
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:02,950
以至于人类无法用脚把你踩死
that the foot of man is incapable of crushing you!

1384
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:05,310
胆大包天
How dare you!

1385
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:08,590
即使是你  彭德尔顿
Yet even you, Pendleton,

1386
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:12,700
早就该因叛国罪被送上绞刑架的你
who should have been gibbetted for treason long before today,

1387
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:18,230
即使一文不值  也该被法律平等对待
even worthless unworthy you ought to be treated equally before the law!

1388
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:23,530
因此  先生  我再一再二再三强调
And so again, sir, and again and again and again I say:

1389
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,950
我不认为人人生来一切平等
I DO NOT HOLD WITH EQUALITY IN ALL THINGS.

1390
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:30,120
我认同的是法律面前人人平等
ONLY WITH EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.

1391
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,430
议长先生  您竟然容许这种无耻粗俗的人
Mr. Speaker, will you permit this vile boorish man

1392
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:38,610
诽谤我  威胁我
to slander ant to threaten me and

1393
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,400
您问过我  我什么时候惊讶过
You asked if ever I was surprised.

1394
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,870
就在今天  史蒂文斯先生
Today Mr. Stevens,

1395
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,520
我十分震惊
I was surprised.

1396
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:22,800
您为了种族平等斗争30年
You've led the battle for race equality for thirty years!

1397
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:31,840
这是国家未来的基石
The basis of of every hope for this country's future life,

1398
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:34,930
现在您却否认黑人的权利  真令人作呕
you denied Negro equality! I'm nauseated.

1399
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:39,100
您否认人人都有生而为人的权利
You refused to say that all humans are, well human!

1400
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:42,620
您出卖了自己的灵魂吗  史蒂文斯先生
Have you lost your very soul, Mr. Stevens

1401
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,280
您不是什么都敢说吗
Is there nothing you won't say?

1402
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,300
真抱歉让你恶心阿萨  这肯定让人不适
I'm sorry you're nauseous, Asa, that must be unpleasant.

1403
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:50,480
我希望修正案能通过
I want the amendment to pass.

1404
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:53,770
这样宪法中唯一关于奴隶制的表述便是
So that the Constitution's first and only mention of slavery

1405
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,620
它毫无疑问应该被废除
is its absolute prohibition.

1406
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:58,490
为了修正案  为了我终生的事业
For this amendment, for which I have worked all of my life

1407
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:02,260
为了无数为争取权利而牺牲的黑人
and for which countless colored men and women have fought and died

1408
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,650
现在  也为了那些护国安邦的将士
and now hundreds of thousands of soldiers.

1409
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:06,130
我没有出卖灵魂  先生  没有
No, sir, no.

1410
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:11,210
也没有什么事不敢说的
It seems there is very nearly nothing I won't say.

1411
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,930
我不进去了
I'm not going in.

1412
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,960
你说过想帮我
You said you wanted to help me.

1413
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,590
这  这只不过是你想让我丧失斗志的把戏
This is This is just a clumsy attempt at discouragement.

1414
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,050
我去过战地医院  见过那些外科手术
I've been to army hospitals, I've seen surgeries,

1415
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:00,540
我还和妈妈一起去过疟疾横行的驳船
I went and visited the malaria barges with mama.

1416
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:03,150
她说她没带你进去
She told me she didn't take you inside.

1417
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,420
我之后偷偷溜进去了
I snuck in afterwards.

1418
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:06,930
我知道那是什么样子  你吓不到我
I've seen what it's like, this changes nothing.

1419
01:26:09,490 --> 01:26:13,000
不管怎么说  很高兴你能陪我来
At all rates, I'm happy to have your company.

1420
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:20,830
早上好  吉姆
Morning, Jim.

1421
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,440
早上好  总统先生
Hello, Mr. President.

1422
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:24,110
很高兴又见到你
Good to see you again.

1423
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:29,370
小伙子们  第一个问题  吃得好吗
Well boys, first question: You getting enough to eat?

1424
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,410
你好  先生
Hello, sir.

1425
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:31,490
你叫什名字  战士  罗伯特
- What's your name, soldier? - Robert.

1426
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:33,720
罗伯特  很高兴见到你  罗伯特
Robert. Good to meet you, Robert.

1427
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:34,480
很高兴见到您
Nice to meet you.

1428
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:35,490
你叫什名字  凯文
- What's your name? - Kevin.

1429
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:36,480
我经过时告诉我你们的名字
Tell me your names as I go past.

1430
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,080
我希望知道你们的名字  凯文是吗
I like to know who I'm talkin' to. Kevin.

1431
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,910
总统先生  约翰  约翰
- Mr. President, John. - John.

1432
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,690
我见过你  总统先生
- I've seen you before. - Mr. President

1433
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:45,010
一定要吃些肉  我不会介意
Make sure you get some steak, I wouldn't mind

1434
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,500
怎么了  鲍勃
What's the matter, Bob?

1435
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,270
我要参军
I have to do this!

1436
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:12,590
我要参军  我入伍不需要经过你的同意
And I will do it and I don't need your permission to enlist.

1437
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:16,270
从战争开始  有多少儿子
That same speech has been made by how many sons,

1438
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,000
对他们的父亲说过一样的话
to how many fathers since the war began?

1439
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,250
我才不需要你该死的许可  老家伙
I don't need your damn permission, you miserable old goat,

1440
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:23,110
无论如何我都会参军
I'm gonna enlist anyhow!

1441
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:25,640
又有多少父亲对他们儿子
And what wouldn't those numberless fathers have given

1442
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:28,980
说出我要对你说出的这番话
to be able to say to their sons as I now say to mine,

1443
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:31,030
我才是总司令
I'm commander-in-chief,

1444
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:33,300
没有我的允许
so in point of fact, without my permission,

1445
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:36,330
你不能参军  年轻人
you ain't enlisting in nothing, nowhere, young man.

1446
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:38,750
你只是怕妈妈  根本不是担心我的死活
It's mama you're scared of, not me getting killed.

1447
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:49,290
我必须参军  我一定会的
I have to do this! And I will!

1448
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:52,860
不然余生我都会以此为耻
Or I will feel ashamed of myself for the rest of my life.

1449
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:55,020
能不能上战场根本无所谓
Whether or not you fought is what's gonna matter.

1450
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:57,260
这不仅仅是为了别人  也是为了我自己
And not just to other people, but to myself.

1451
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:59,600
我成不了您  爸爸  我办不到
I won't be you, pa. I can't do that.

1452
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,970
但是我不想碌碌无为
But I don't want to be nothing.

1453
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:14,570
他会没事的  玛丽
He'll be fine, Mary.

1454
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:18,710
锡蒂波因特离前线有一段距离
City Point's away back from the front lines, from the fighting,

1455
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:22,140
他会被安排去做格兰特将军传信的副官
he'll be an adjutant running messages for General Grant.

1456
01:29:23,470 --> 01:29:25,270
战争会要了我们儿子的命
The war will take our son!

1457
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:27,950
那些狙击手  弹片  伤寒
A sniper, or a shrapnel shell, or typhus!

1458
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:29,590
像威利一样
Same as took Willie,

1459
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:31,240
每天都有成百上千的孩子在那死去
it takes hundreds of boys a day!

1460
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:32,990
他只会成为无谓的牺牲品
He'll die uselessly,

1461
01:29:32,990 --> 01:29:34,950
到时候你让我怎么原谅你
and how will I ever forgive you?

1462
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,950
大多数人  都最喜欢长子长女  但是你
Most men, their firstborn is their favorite, but you,

1463
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:41,640
你却一直责怪罗伯特的出生
you've always blamed Robert for being born,

1464
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:44,660
说那让你为婚姻所困  让你陷入不幸
for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief

1465
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:47,090
让你后悔  不是这样
- and caused you regret. - That's simply not true.

1466
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,410
如果冷泉港那样的屠杀再发生(1864年5月冷泉港战役  北军伤亡5万多人  南军只损失约2万人)
And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor is on your hands same as Grant,

1467
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:51,080
我们只能祈求上帝相助
God help us!

1468
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:54,560
我们要为你犯下的那些数不清的屠杀付出代价
We'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood you've sanctioned,

1469
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:56,230
我们的儿子会用他的鲜血
the uncountable corpses we'll be made to pay

1470
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:58,470
为那些堆积如山的尸骨做陪葬
with our son's dear blood.

1471
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,430
就这次  就这次  林肯夫人
Just, just this once, Mrs. Lincoln,

1472
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:04,850
我求你用解放人类而不是自私的观点来看问题
I demand of you to try and take the liberal and not the selfish point of view.

1473
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:08,430
如果我们继续扼杀他的发自内心的抱负
Robert will never forgive himself. You imagine he'll forgive us

1474
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:11,940
罗伯特将永远无法原谅自己  你还能奢望他原谅我们吗
if we continue to stifle his very natural ambition?!

1475
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,700
如果我不同意呢
And if I refuse to take the highroad,

1476
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,310
如果我无法再背负更多痛苦了呢
if I won't take up the rough old cross,

1477
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:24,740
你是不是又要威胁我  送我去疯人院
will you threaten me again with the madhouse,

1478
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,000
就像我无法停止为威利的死终日哭泣时那样
as you did when I couldn't stop crying over Willie,

1479
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:33,500
就像我让你看到什么是真的心碎的时候那样
when I showed you what heartbreak, real heartbreak looked like,

1480
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:36,950
而你根本就没有勇气面对  没有勇气帮我
and you hadn't the courage to countenance it, to help me

1481
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:39,420
没错  当你拒绝去安慰泰德的时候
That's right. When you refused so much as to comfort Tad

1482
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:42,270
那孩子不仅仅身体不好  我当时在房间里陪着威利
- the child who was not only sick - I was in the room with Willie,

1483
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:44,710
还极度悲伤  我那时正抱着他
- but beside himself with grief? - I was holding him

1484
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:46,830
但你只想着你的悲伤  你的悲伤  他死在了我怀里
- Oh but your grief, your grief, your- in my arms as he died!

1485
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,250
无穷无尽的悲伤  你怎么敢这样说我
- inexhaustible grief! - How dare you throw that at me?!

1486
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:51,100
他的母亲居然不让他靠近自己  我不能让泰德进来
- And his mother won't let him near her, - I couldn't let Tad in!

1487
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:53,130
因为她一天到晚都在不停尖叫  我不想让他
- 'cos she's screaming from morning to night, - I couldn't risk him

1488
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:55,030
你在走廊上乱晃  看见我生气的样子
- pacing the corridors - seeing how angry I was!

1489
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:57,470
对着影子家具和鬼魂大喊大叫
howling at shadows and furniture and ghosts!

1490
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:59,810
我早就该你去疯人院
I ought to have done it,

1491
01:30:59,810 --> 01:31:01,060
为了泰德我早就该这么做
I ought have done for Tad's sake,

1492
01:31:01,070 --> 01:31:04,330
为了每一个人  我早就该送你去疯人院
for everybody's goddamned sake, I should have clapped you in the madhouse!

1493
01:31:04,370 --> 01:31:05,980
你送啊
Then do it!!

1494
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:09,090
来啊  别只威胁我
Do it! Don't you threaten me,

1495
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:11,320
你快来吧  把我锁起来
you do it this time, lock me away!

1496
01:31:11,410 --> 01:31:16,190
你一定会的  我发誓  如果罗伯特死了的话
You'll have to, I swear! If Robert is killed

1497
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:37,110
我不能忍受你再为威利难过
I couldn't tolerate you grieving so for Willie

1498
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:39,530
因为我也不会允许自己这么做
because I couldn't permit it in myself,

1499
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:42,220
尽管我希望如此  玛丽
though I wanted to, Mary.

1500
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:48,030
我想过陪他入土  守着他的灵柩
I wanted to crawl under the earth, into the vault with his coffin.

1501
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:50,860
而且我现在依旧这样想
And I still do.

1502
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:52,890
无时无刻不这么想
Everyday I do.

1503
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:54,880
所以不要跟我讲悲伤
Don't speak to me about grief.

1504
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:08,180
鲍勃  你还有我  都必须要做出自己的决定
I must make my decisions, Bob must make his, you yours.

1505
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:12,190
必须承担我们要承担的  忍受我们要忍受的
And bear what we must, hold and carry what we must.

1506
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:16,030
当我忍受这些时  你要允许我
What I carry within me, you must allow me to do it,

1507
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:18,970
独自承受自己必须承受的  你也一样  玛丽
alone as I must. And you alone, Mary,

1508
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,510
承受你自己的部分
you alone

1509
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:22,840
这样可以减轻彼此的负担
may lighten this burden,

1510
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:27,580
或者你可以选择  把一切推向崩溃
or render it intolerable. As you choose.

1511
01:32:35,190 --> 01:32:41,190
歌剧为浮士德

1512
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:51,570
你以为我不知道你在做什么吗
You think I'm ignorant of what you're up to

1513
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:53,220
你以为你打算不跟我商量这些事
because you haven't discussed this scheme

1514
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,130
我就不知道了吗
with me as you ought to have done.

1515
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:58,260
我什么时候那么好糊弄
When have I ever been so easily bamboozled?

1516
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:59,660
当你坚持要让修正案通过
I believe you

1517
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:00,930
要废除奴隶制的时候
when you insist that amending the constitution

1518
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:03,420
我相信你
and abolishing slavery will end this war.

1519
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:05,670
但是既然你把我们的儿子送上战场
And since you are sending my son into the war,

1520
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:08,440
不让修正案通过  你就等着吃苦头吧
woe unto you if you fail to pass the amendment.

1521
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:16,730
苏厄德不想最后弄得政以贿成
Seward doesn't want me leaving big muddy footprints all over town.

1522
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:22,780
你比谁都清楚
No one has ever lived who knows better than you

1523
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:26,430
官场上的那些权谋算计
the proper placement of footfalls on treacherous paths.

1524
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:30,020
苏厄德不做  你就要去做
Seward can't do it. You must.

1525
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:33,620
如果你不能拿到必要的选票
Because if you fail to acquire the necessary votes,

1526
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:36,730
你就麻烦了  想想到时候你怎么向我交代
woe unto you, sir, you will answer to me.

1527
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:01,100
我知道还有4天就要投票了
I know the vote is only four days away.

1528
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:03,780
我知道您很担心
I know you're concerned.

1529
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:05,970
谢谢您为这件事如此操劳
Thank you for your concern over this,

1530
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:09,380
我想告诉您  修正案会通过的
and I want you to know, they'll approve it.

1531
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,600
上帝会保佑的
God will see to it.

1532
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:17,000
我可不羡慕上帝的工作
I don't envy him His task.

1533
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:21,120
相对于去向众议员拉票
He may wish He'd chosen an instrument for His purpose

1534
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:23,460
他可能会采取一种更加合适的方法来实现目的
more wieldy than the House of Representatives.

1535
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:26,570
那么你会确保它通过的
Then you'll see to it.

1536
01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:32,040
你有没有担心过你们的未来
Are you afraid of what lies ahead for your people?

1537
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,540
如果我们通过了
If we succeed?

1538
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:38,140
白人不会希望我们呆在这
White people don't want us here.

1539
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:40,810
很多人可能不会  您呢
- Many don't. - What about you?

1540
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,880
我并不了解您  凯克莉夫人
I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley.

1541
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:51,210
不了解你们的任何一员
Any of you.

1542
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:55,590
我很熟悉你们  你们所有人
You're familiar to me, as all people are.

1543
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:59,080
我眼中的你们
Unaccommodated, poor, bare,

1544
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,910
居无定所  食不果腹  贫穷却又勤劳
forked creatures such as we all are.

1545
01:35:02,770 --> 01:35:05,520
但是你们有权利期待我所期待的一切
You have a right to expect what I expect,

1546
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:10,740
我们也能理解彼此的期盼
and likely our expectations are not incomprehensible to each other.

1547
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:16,450
我知道我能习惯你们
I assume I'll get used to you.

1548
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,620
但是你们对于这个国家意味着什么
But what you are to the nation,

1549
01:35:20,730 --> 01:35:24,260
你们被解放后的未来  我并不知道会怎样
what'll become of you once slavery's day is done, I don't know.

1550
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:29,500
我不知道我的同胞是怎么想的
What my people are to be, I can't say.

1551
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:34,850
黑人们一直在为自由而战斗牺牲
Negroes have been fighting and dying for freedom

1552
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,940
因为我们是第一批奴隶
since the first of us was a slave.

1553
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:42,040
我从未听说有人过问自由会带来什么
I never heard any ask what freedom will bring.

1554
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,360
因为首先要得到自由
Freedom's a first.

1555
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:49,440
至于我
As for me

1556
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:53,030
我的儿子身穿联军的蓝色制服
My son died, fighting for the Union

1557
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:56,590
为联军战死沙场
wearing the Union blue.

1558
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:58,960
为了自由而牺牲
For freedom he died.

1559
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:02,660
我是他的母亲
I'm his mother.

1560
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:07,790
这就是我对国家的意义  林肯先生
That's what I am to the nation, Mr. Lincoln.

1561
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:13,910
仅此而已
What else must I be?

1562
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:25,340
不要多久我就能凑手好牌
My whole hand's gonna be proud in about five seconds.

1563
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:27,490
是吗  那我倒要看看  让你看看我的牌
- Oh, it is? What you got goin'? - Let's see how proud you gonna be.

1564
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,390
干什么  走开
- Yeah? - Go away!

1565
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:32,470
那个表链是金的吗  别盯着我的表带
- That watch fob, is that gold? - You keep your eyes off my fob!

1566
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:33,640
先生们  对9
- Gentlemen - Nines paired!

1567
01:36:33,730 --> 01:36:36,310
有客人来了  去你的
- you have a visitor. - Oh my God damn!

1568
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:40,290
好吧  这下完蛋了
Well, I'll be fucked.

1569
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,720
我也是这么想的  您是
I wouldn't bet against it, Mr?

1570
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:47,040
比尔博  比尔博先生
- W.N. Bilbo. - Yeah, Mr. Bilbo.

1571
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,940
先生们  先生
- Gentlemen. - Sir

1572
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:52,060
您怎么在这里  我无意冒犯
Why are you here? No offense, but Mr. Seward's

1573
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:54,310
但苏厄德先生不允许我们提起您的名字
banished the very mention of your name,

1574
01:36:54,330 --> 01:36:56,470
他甚至不允许我们用5美元的钞票(林肯绿币  南北战争前  林肯为筹集战争资金而发行的一种债券)
he won't even let us use fifty-cent pieces

1575
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:57,750
因为上面印有您的头像
'cause they got your face on 'em.

1576
01:36:58,670 --> 01:37:00,940
国务卿告诉我
The Secretary of State here tells me that, uh,

1577
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,830
你们从民主党那里争取到11张选票  真不错
you got eleven Democrats in the bag, that's encouraging.

1578
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:06,660
您不会为了11张选票而高兴的
Oh, you've got no cause to be encouraged,

1579
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,720
先生
Sir. Uh

1580
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:11,230
我们被解雇了吗
Are we being fired?

1581
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:16,380
我们可都听到午夜的钟声了  夏禄先生(莎士比亚《亨利四世》)
We have heard the chimes of midnight, Master Shallow.

1582
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:22,000
我来这是为了告诉你们  胜利的钟声就要敲响
I'm here to alert you boys that the great day of reckoning is nigh upon us.

1583
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:24,160
我们还没有把民主党的票收入囊中呢
The Democrats we've yet to bag, sir.

1584
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,880
利诱还远远不够
The patronage jobs simply won't bag 'em.

1585
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:30,730
他们想要  更有说服力的东西  总统先生
They require more convincing, Mr. President.

1586
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:34,640
帮我个忙  好吗
Do me a favor, will ya?

1587
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:35,630
当然
Sure.

1588
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:37,570
我今早看了下报纸
I snagged my eye in the paper this morning,

1589
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:41,020
看到科廷州长计划公布
and Governor Curtin is set to declare a winner in the

1590
01:37:41,070 --> 01:37:43,070
在饱受争议的国会选举中的胜出者
disputed Congressional election for the

1591
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:44,270
宾夕法尼亚16区的
Pennsylvania 16th District.

1592
01:37:44,310 --> 01:37:46,670
没错  很高兴有人能跟上我的思路
District. What a joy to be comprehended.

1593
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:49,590
那位议员打算亲自去拜访科廷州长
Hop on a train to Philadell, call on the Governor

1594
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,350
让莱瑟姆或者谢尔去一趟
Send Latham. Or Schell.

1595
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:54,070
不  他能做好的  好好磨练一番总是能行的
No, he'll do fine, just polish yourself up first.

1596
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:56,640
他可是州长钦定的
The incumbent is claiming he won it.

1597
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:58,370
名字是  科夫罗斯
- Name of, uh - Coffroth.

1598
01:37:58,720 --> 01:37:59,830
没错  就是他  科夫罗斯
- That's him. - Coffroth.

1599
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,810
他是个民主党  我知道
- He is a Democrat. - I understand that.

1600
01:38:02,410 --> 01:38:04,350
这名字真傻  的确有点
- Silly name. - A little bit silly.

1601
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:08,130
告诉科廷州长
Huh, Tell Governor Curtin it'd be much appreciated

1602
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:11,890
如果他能亲自来众议院一趟  就再好不过了
if he'd invite the House of Representatives to decide who won.

1603
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,190
他有权这么做  也会这么做
He's entitled to do that. He'll agree to it.

1604
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:18,810
然后转告那个科夫罗斯  如果他想保住席位
Then advise Coffroth, if he hopes to retain his seat,

1605
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,910
他最好拜访一下塞德斯・史蒂文斯
that he'd better pay a visit to Thaddeus Stevens.

1606
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:24,640
可怜的科夫罗斯
Oh, pity poor Coffroth!

1607
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,840
门没锁
It opens!

1608
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,880
你就是坎夫雷
You are Canfrey?

1609
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,760
是科夫罗斯  史蒂文斯先生
Coffroth, Mr. Stevens,

1610
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:40,670
亚历山大・科夫罗斯
Alexander Coffroth, I'm

1611
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:43,050
我们是同一个州代表的吗
Are we representatives of the same state?

1612
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:45,670
是  是的先生  我们中间只隔了3个位子
Y-yes sir, We sit only three desks apart.

1613
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:48,110
我没见过你
I haven't noticed you. I'm

1614
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:50,850
我是共和党的  你  科夫罗普  是民主党的
a Republican, and you, Coughdrop, are a Democrat?

1615
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:52,910
那个
Well

1616
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:54,810
我是说
Um, that is to say, I

1617
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:57,910
你只不过让自己还无主见地附和
The modern travesty of Thomas Jefferson's political organization

1618
01:38:57,930 --> 01:39:00,030
扭曲托马斯・杰斐逊政治纲领的团体
to which you have attached yourself like a barnacle

1619
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:03,110
还好意思叫自己民主党人
has the effrontery to call itself The Democratic Party.

1620
01:39:03,130 --> 01:39:05,370
你不过是个民主党跟屁虫
You are a Dem-O-crat.

1621
01:39:05,390 --> 01:39:07,560
你打算干什么  玩我吗
What's the matter with you? Are you wicked?

1622
01:39:07,930 --> 01:39:09,190
那个  我觉得  事实上
Well, I felt, um, formerly, I

1623
01:39:09,230 --> 01:39:10,500
不要紧  科夫斯诺
Never mind, Coffsnot,

1624
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,760
你刚刚在11月的选举里被强有力的竞争对手
you were ignominiously trounced at the hustings

1625
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:16,030
一个共和党人打得毫无还手之力
in November's election by your worthy challenger, a Republican.

1626
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:17,820
不  先生  我没有  被打败
No, sir, I was not, um, trounced!

1627
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,830
他想窃取我的席位  我没有输掉选举
Uh, he wants to steal my seat! I didn't lose the election

1628
01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:21,440
你输没输有什么区别
What difference does it make if you lost or not,

1629
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:24,890
你们的州长  也是个  是个民主党人吗
the governor of our state, is A Democrat?

1630
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,360
不  他是
No, he's a

1631
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:31,220
那个  他是
A, um, a Ruh

1632
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:32,120
共
Re.

1633
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:34,330
共
Re.

1634
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:36,560
和  和
- Pub. - Pub.

1635
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:37,810
党  党
- Li. - Li.

1636
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,340
人  人  共和党人
- Can. - Can. Republican.

1637
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:41,550
我知道他是哪派的  我刚刚说的是个反问句
I know what he is. This is a rhetorical exercise.

1638
01:39:41,610 --> 01:39:44,270
那国会是被哪个党派控制的  你的吗
And Congress is controlled by what party? Yours?

1639
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,890
你的党派被打败了
Your party was beaten,

1640
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:50,640
你的敌对党现在接手了议会
your challenger's party now controls the House,

1641
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:53,430
之后还会接手内务委员会
and hence the House Committee on Elections,

1642
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:56,000
所以你们彻底败了
so you have been beaten.

1643
01:39:56,030 --> 01:39:58,970
你们马上就要卷铺盖走人  除非
You shall shortly be sent home in disgrace. Unless

1644
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,090
我知道我要做什么  先生
I know what I must do, sir,

1645
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:02,400
我会立刻加入共和党  投赞成票给
I will immediately become a Republican and vote yes for

1646
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:03,510
不
NO!

1647
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:06,860
科夫罗斯  会投赞成票
Coffroth will vote yes,

1648
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:09,840
但是科夫罗斯会保持民主党的身份  直到投票结束
but Coffroth will remain a Democrat until after he does so.

1649
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,530
为什么要等  我不介意现在就换
Why wait to switch? I'm happy to switch

1650
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,640
我们想让修正案看起来是两党共同支持的  蠢货
We want to show the amendment has bipartisan support, you idiot.

1651
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:18,110
等下次的议会  我让你转党派  你再换
Early in the next Congress, when I tell you to do so, you will switch parties.

1652
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:21,510
现在祝贺你选举成功  你可以出去了
Now congratulations on your victory, and get out.

1653
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:26,220
现在  把剩下目标的名单给我
Now give me the names of whoever else you been hunting.

1654
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:30,890
乔治・伊曼  没错  伊曼
- George Yeaman. - Yes. Yeaman.

1655
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:33,040
在这些人当中
Among others.

1656
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:34,890
伊曼可能有戏
But Yeaman, that'd count.

1657
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:38,170
YEAMAN  我知道了
- Y-E-A-M-A-N. - I got it.

1658
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:46,970
我不能给修正案投赞成票
I can't vote for the amendment, Mr. Lincoln.

1659
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,470
伊曼先生  我曾经见过一艘驳船
I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman,

1660
01:40:56,910 --> 01:40:59,210
里面全是被锁上的黑人
filled with colored men in chains,

1661
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:00,600
沿密西西比河顺流而下
heading down the Mississippi

1662
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,300
前往新奥尔良的奴隶市场
to the New Orleans slave markets.

1663
01:41:04,130 --> 01:41:05,940
它令我作呕
It sickened me.

1664
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:08,830
不仅如此  它还给我留下阴影
And more than that, it brought a shadow down,

1665
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:12,920
无法磨灭的阴影
a pall around my eyes.

1666
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:16,850
从我记事起  奴隶制就一直困扰我
Slavery troubled me as long as I can remember

1667
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:20,410
远远超过它对我父亲的困扰
in a way it never troubled my father,

1668
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:24,000
尽管我父亲用自己的方式憎恨奴隶制
though he hated it, in his own fashion.

1669
01:41:24,930 --> 01:41:26,390
他知道拥有小块土地的农夫
He knew no small holding dirt farmer

1670
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:28,710
无法与拥有奴隶种植园的奴隶主匹敌
could compete with slave plantations.

1671
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:31,120
他带我们离开肯塔基州
He took us out from Kentucky

1672
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:34,640
离开那些人  他希望在印第安纳州保持中立
to get away from them. He wanted Indiana kept free.

1673
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:37,840
他不是个仁慈的人
He wasn't a kind man,

1674
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:44,200
但是发自内心对公正最原始的渴求  驱使他追求自由
but there was a rough moral urge for fairness, for freedom in him.

1675
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:47,240
我想这是我从他身上学到的东西
I learnt that from him, I suppose,

1676
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:50,050
如果说我从他身上学到了什么的话
if little else from him.

1677
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,630
我们从未关心过对方  伊曼先生
We didn't care for one another, Mr. Yeaman.

1678
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,490
听到这些  我很难过  爱与仁慈
- Well, I'm sorry to hear that.- Loving kindness,

1679
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,450
这些生活中无处不在的东西
that most ordinary thing came to me

1680
01:42:02,570 --> 01:42:04,780
总让我心怀感激
from other sources.. I'm grateful for that.

1681
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:08,290
我  我也厌恶它  先生
I I hate it, too, sir

1682
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:10,440
我恨奴隶制  但是
slavery, but

1683
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:14,640
但是我们还没有为解放做好准备
but we're entirely unready for emancipation.

1684
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:18,330
还有太多的问题  我们也没有为和平做好准备  不是吗
- There's too many questions - We're unready for peace too, ain't we?

1685
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:19,570
当和平到来的时候
Yeah, when it comes,

1686
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:21,420
我们会遇到各种棘手的难题
it'll present us with conundrums and

1687
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:22,980
比我们在战争中见的 甚至比战争是更多的危险
dangers greater than any we've faced during the war,dangers greater than any

1688
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:26,040
甚至是同战争时一样多的鲜血 更大的危险  同样的鲜血淋漓
we've faced during the war, bloody as it's been.bloody as it's been.

1689
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:29,030
我们需要根据实际情况来尝试及调整
We'll have to extemporize and experiment with

1690
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:31,550
才能找到最佳的方法和时机
what it is, when it is.

1691
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:36,690
我读了你的演讲稿  乔治
I read your speech, George.

1692
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:41,320
黑人和选举权  真是个难题
Negroes and the vote, that's a puzzle.

1693
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:45,040
不  不  但是
No, no, but-but-but

1694
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:50,170
但黑人不能  有权投票  林肯先生
but Negroes can't um vote, Mr. Lincoln.

1695
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:52,990
您不会是想赋予有色人种选举权吧
You're not suggesting we enfranchise colored people.

1696
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,810
我只是在请求你将自己
I'm asking only that you

1697
01:42:54,810 --> 01:42:58,040
从奴隶主势力中解放出来
disenthrall yourself from the slave powers.

1698
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:02,910
我如果收到和平请愿的话会一定会告诉你
I'll let you know when there's an offer on my desk for surrender.

1699
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:04,200
但现在没有
There's none before us now.

1700
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:05,440
现在摆在我们面前的
What's before us now,

1701
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,930
是第13号修正案的投票
that's the vote on the Thirteenth Amendment.

1702
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:11,890
票数会咬得很紧
It's going to be so very close.

1703
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:16,640
看看你能做点什么
You see what you can do.

1704
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:29,370
我无法理解  他为何因此而死
I can't make sense of it, what he died for.

1705
01:43:32,810 --> 01:43:35,430
林肯先生  我恨他们所有人
Mr. Lincoln, I hate them all.

1706
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:37,450
我恨所有黑人
I do, all black people.

1707
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:49,610
我的确心存偏见
I am a prejudiced man.

1708
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:55,050
我愿意改变你的偏见  但我来不是为了这个
I'd change that in you if I could, but that's not why I come.

1709
01:43:56,170 --> 01:43:58,090
我可能搞错了  哈顿先生
I might be wrong, Mr. Hutton,

1710
01:43:58,090 --> 01:44:01,600
但有色人种很可能会得到自由
but I expect colored people will most likely be free.

1711
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:04,420
那时候你就会明白  是你弟弟的英勇
And when that's so, it's simple truth that your brother's

1712
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:07,560
和他的牺牲  促成了这一切
bravery, and his death, helped make it so.

1713
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:12,790
只有你能决定这样是不是有意义
Only you can decide whether that's sense enough for you, or not.

1714
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:17,990
我对你的家人致以最深切的哀悼
My deepest sympathies to your family.

1715
01:44:30,110 --> 01:44:32,910
我们的人做得非常漂亮
We've managed our members to a fare-thee-well.

1716
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:35,050
右翼共和党
You've had no defections

1717
01:44:35,050 --> 01:44:37,050
没有出现反对声音
from the Republican right to trouble you.

1718
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:40,740
但你的保证呢
Whereas as to what you promised

1719
01:44:41,030 --> 01:44:43,440
特使团都他妈的在哪呢
where the hell are the commissioners?!

1720
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:46,820
天啊  原来是真的
Oh my God It's true!

1721
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:52,120
您  您骗了我  林肯先生
You you lied to me, Mr. Lincoln!

1722
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:53,920
您不让我否认
You evaded my requests for a

1723
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,640
邦联提出求和的传言
denial that-that there is a Confederate peace offer

1724
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:58,640
因为确有此事
because because there is one!

1725
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,840
我们绝对全盘皆输
We are absolutely guaranteed to lose the whole thing!

1726
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:06,100
我们不需要什么该死的废奴修正案
We don't need a goddamned abolition amendment.

1727
01:45:06,210 --> 01:45:08,230
别揪着宪法不放了  假如  假如
- Leave the Constitution alone! - What if, what if

1728
01:45:08,290 --> 01:45:10,320
特使团今天出现了  或者
these peace commissioners appear today, or

1729
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:11,000
或者更糟  一大早
or worse, on the morning

1730
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:11,900
你可以一个州一个周的根除
State by state you can extirpate

1731
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:17,250
我听不下去了
I can't listen to this anymore.

1732
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:23,950
在我们把自己从奴隶制里解救出来之前
I can't accomplish a goddamned thing of any human meaning

1733
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:28,510
在这场乌烟瘴气的战争结束之前
or worth until we cure ourselves of slavery,

1734
01:45:28,510 --> 01:45:31,550
我无法做任何对人类有价值的事情
and end this pestilential war,

1735
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,180
不管你们或其他人是否了解
and whether any of you or anyone else knows it,

1736
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:37,440
我知道我需要它
I know I need this!

1737
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:40,230
这份修正案就是解救我的良药
This amendment is that cure!

1738
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:48,510
现在我们走上了世界舞台  现在
We're stepped out upon the world's stage now, NOW!

1739
01:45:48,570 --> 01:45:51,700
人类尊严的命运掌握在我们手中
With the fate of human dignity in our hands!

1740
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:56,100
多少鲜血才成就了今时今刻
Blood's been spilt to afford us this moment!

1741
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:58,860
现在  现在  现在
Now now now!

1742
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:01,900
可你们就知道抱怨  质问  逃避
But you grousle and heckle and dodge about

1743
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:05,150
跟一群无知的坦幕尼小丑一样(坦慕尼协会  成立于1789年的纽约民主党组织  因政治腐败而臭名昭著)
like pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters!

1744
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,630
看看摆在你们面前的是什么
See what is before you!

1745
01:46:08,230 --> 01:46:12,290
睁眼看看现实  这才是最大的困难
See the here and now! That's the hardest thing,

1746
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,730
也是唯一有意义的事情
the only thing that accounts!

1747
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:20,420
通过宪法条款废除奴隶制
Abolishing slavery by constitutional provision

1748
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:24,810
是一劳永逸的解决方法
settles the fate, for all coming time,

1749
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:28,410
不仅解放了现今的数百万奴隶
not only of the millions now in bondage

1750
01:46:30,630 --> 01:46:34,130
也改变了无数子孙后代的命运
but of unborn millions to come.

1751
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:37,380
再有两张选票就能实现
Two votes stand in its way,

1752
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:40,010
这两张票势在必得
and these votes must be procured!

1753
01:46:43,690 --> 01:46:48,100
再有2张赞成票加3张弃权票  或者
We need two yeses, three abstentions, or

1754
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:53,310
4张赞成加1张弃权  修正案就通过了
four yeses and one more abstention and the amendment will pass.

1755
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:54,520
还有一天两夜
You got a night and a day and a night

1756
01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:56,600
加好几个小时的时间
and several perfectly good hours,

1757
01:46:56,620 --> 01:46:58,470
现在就出去拉选票
now get the hell out of here and get 'em!

1758
01:46:58,510 --> 01:47:00,930
好  但怎么做
Yes. But how?

1759
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,360
拿出鹫鹰的勇气来  小子
Buzzards' guts, man.

1760
01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:11,330
我是美利坚合众国的总统
I am the President of the United States of America,

1761
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:14,710
身披无上权力
clothed in immense power!

1762
01:47:16,590 --> 01:47:18,590
你们去给我把选票弄到手
You will procure me these votes.

1763
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:29,290
投票当天早上  1865年1月31日

1764
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:31,790
女士们先生们  欢迎来到众议院
We welcome you, ladies and gentlemen,

1765
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:38,480
这对于本间民众议会厅来说是史无先例的
first in the history of this people's chamber, to your House!

1766
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:05,420
阿什利先生  有请你来发言
Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours.

1767
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,300
今天我们将对面前的这份联合决议投票
On the matter of the joint resolution before us,

1768
01:49:15,310 --> 01:49:18,560
本决议称为宪法第13号修正案
presenting a Thirteenth Amendment to our national Constitution,

1769
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:20,970
已于去年获得参议院决议通过
which was passed last year by the Senate,

1770
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:22,810
过去的几周里
and which has been debated now

1771
01:49:22,810 --> 01:49:25,400
在座的各位也对此进行了激烈辩论
by this estimable body for the past several weeks,

1772
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:27,880
今天是投票的时刻
today we will vote.

1773
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:37,730
经双方协定  我们将做简短的最终陈述
By mutual agreement, we shall hear brief final statements,

1774
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:42,830
由俄亥俄州的乔治・彭德尔顿阁下开始
beginning with the honorable George Pendleton of Ohio.

1775
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:50,450
我刚刚
I've just received

1776
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:53,640
证实了
confirmation

1777
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:56,290
之前的某个传言
of what previously has been merely rumored!

1778
01:49:56,490 --> 01:49:57,900
和平宣誓书
Affidavits!

1779
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,870
忠诚的民众从里士满将它带回
From loyal citizens recently returned from Richmond.

1780
01:50:00,930 --> 01:50:03,840
他们证实了特使团的确已经北上
They testify that Commissioners have indeed come north

1781
01:50:03,870 --> 01:50:07,090
现在应该已经到达华盛顿了
and ought to have arrived by now in Washington City,

1782
01:50:07,170 --> 01:50:11,760
使者们此行旨在立即停止内战
bearing an offer of immediate cessation of our civil war!

1783
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:15,300
是真的吗  先生
Is it true, sir?

1784
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:17,700
国会大厦里有邦联使者在吗
Are there Confederate commissioners in the Capitol?

1785
01:50:17,850 --> 01:50:20,410
我  我不知道他们在哪  到没到
I don't I have no idea where they are or if they've arrived.

1786
01:50:20,450 --> 01:50:21,400
到没到
If they've arrived?!

1787
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,040
我呼吁所有民主党同伴
I appeal to my fellow Democrats,

1788
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:27,120
以及热爱和平的共和党代表
to all Republican representatives who give a fig for peace!

1789
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:29,080
推迟本次投票
Postpone this vote

1790
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:32,470
直到总统本人给我们一个解释为止
until we have answers from the President himself!

1791
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,970
推迟投票  推迟投票
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1792
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:42,070
推迟投票  推迟投票
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1793
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:45,200
推迟投票  推迟投票
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1794
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:47,720
先生们
Gentlemen!

1795
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:57,720
我有个提议
I have made a motion!

1796
01:50:57,740 --> 01:51:01,110
有人愿意支持我的提议吗
Does anyone here care to second my motion?

1797
01:51:01,130 --> 01:51:03,930
推迟投票  推迟投票
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1798
01:51:12,810 --> 01:51:13,840
先生们
Gentlemen.

1799
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:18,800
如果和平提议成为通过修正案的交换条件
The conservative faction of border and western Republicans

1800
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:21,220
那么边境保守派和西部共和党
cannot approve this amendment,

1801
01:51:21,330 --> 01:51:23,730
就无法认可这份
about which we harbor grave doubts,

1802
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,850
让我们存有重大疑问的修正案
if a peace offer is being held hostage to its success.

1803
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:31,380
我决定加入民主党阵营
Joining together with our Democratic colleagues,

1804
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:33,340
支持推迟投票
I second the motion to postpone.

1805
01:51:33,390 --> 01:51:36,890
快点  老兄  快点
Quick, man! Quick!

1806
01:52:26,050 --> 01:52:30,660
伍德先生想让我对这一点作出回应吗
This is precisely what Mr. Wood wishes me to respond to?

1807
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:32,960
是一字不差吗  他就是想让我
Word for word, this is precisely the assurance

1808
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:35,760
保证这一点吗
that he demands of me?

1809
01:52:35,850 --> 01:52:37,410
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

1810
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:59,230
交给阿什利先生
Give this to Mr. Ashley.

1811
01:53:01,810 --> 01:53:06,390
我觉得  我得说  林肯先生  这
I feel, um, I have to say, Mr. Lincoln, that this

1812
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:08,790
你能先出去吗
Could you please just step outside?!

1813
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,050
你们还想聊天
You gonna have a chat now,

1814
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:12,780
一屋子的众议院代表可都在等这张字条
with the whole of the House of Representatives waiting on that?

1815
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:15,310
向国会做虚假陈述是会
Making false representation to Congress is

1816
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:17,740
会  会被弹劾
- It's, it's - It's impeachable.

1817
01:53:17,770 --> 01:53:20,410
但我并没有做虚假陈述
I've made no such false representation.

1818
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:22,500
但确实有
But there are!

1819
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:24,510
确实有里士满来的代表团
There is a delegation from Richmond.

1820
01:53:24,610 --> 01:53:26,190
把字条给我  约翰尼
Give me the note, Johnnie.

1821
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:32,270
请把这个交给阿什利先生
Please deliver that to Mr. Ashley.

1822
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,560
总统手信
From the President:

1823
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:55,840
据我所知  这座城市里并没有特使团
So far as I know, there are no peace commissioners in the city

1824
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:57,280
之后也不可能有
nor are there likely to be.

1825
01:53:58,630 --> 01:54:00,770
据我所知
So far as I know?!

1826
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:03,030
这根本是废话
That means nothing!

1827
01:54:03,930 --> 01:54:07,480
到底有没有南方来的特使团
Are there commissioners from the South or aren't there?!

1828
01:54:08,450 --> 01:54:10,110
总统已经答复你了  先生
The President has answered you, sir.

1829
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:11,460
你的和平提议是个谎言
Your peace offer is a fiction!

1830
01:54:11,610 --> 01:54:13,150
这不是否认
That is not a denial.

1831
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:15,350
是玩文字游戏
It is a lawyer's dodge!

1832
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:19,040
哈德姆先生  你这一派满意了吗
Mr. Haddam, is your faction satisfied?

1833
01:54:21,370 --> 01:54:24,150
保守共和党一派满意了
The conservative Republican faction's satisfied,

1834
01:54:24,210 --> 01:54:26,250
我们感谢林肯先生
and we thank Mr. Lincoln.

1835
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:29,110
我提议搁置伍德先生的建议
I move to table Mr. Wood's motion.

1836
01:54:29,370 --> 01:54:30,500
已搁置
Tabled!

1837
01:54:34,210 --> 01:54:36,710
科尔法议长  我要求进行主议题
Speaker Colfax, I order the main question.

1838
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:39,080
现收到提议
A motion has been made

1839
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:41,740
要求对第13号修正案议案进行投票
to bring the bill for the Thirteenth Amendment to a vote.

1840
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,740
有人支持吗  我支持此提议
- Do I hear a second? - I second the motion.

1841
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,300
提议批准  要求批准
So moved, so ordered.

1842
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:48,180
书记员将
The clerk will now

1843
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:49,570
请安静
Quiet please.

1844
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:53,270
书记员将进行唱名投票
The clerk will now call the roll for the voting.

02:06:24,330 --> 02:06:25,890
好  然后呢
Yes, and?

1980
02:06:28,690 --> 02:06:31,090
我想让你们这些州
I'd like your states restored

1981
02:06:31,110 --> 02:06:34,850
立即回归到联邦的实际机构中
to their practical relations to the Union immediately.

1982
02:06:38,010 --> 02:06:40,040
如果您能以邦联的副总统的名义
If this could be given me in writing,

1983
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:42,080
将此话落实到书面上
as Vice President of the Confederacy,

1984
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:46,840
我会马上将此文件交给杰斐逊・戴维斯
I'd bring that document with celerity to Jefferson Davis.

1985
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:52,530
先投降  然后再谈机构重组
Surrender, and we can discuss reconstruction.

1986
02:06:54,230 --> 02:06:56,630
除非你们书面保证
Surrender won't be thought of

1987
02:06:56,730 --> 02:06:59,330
我们回归之后还来得及阻止这份修正案
unless you've assured us, in writing,

1988
02:06:59,470 --> 02:07:02,470
否则我们不会考虑投降
that we'll be readmitted in time to block this amendment.

1989
02:07:02,930 --> 02:07:06,810
作为战胜方提出这样的要求未免太自大了
This is the arrogant demand of a conqueror.

1990
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:08,960
你们不是战败方民众
You'll not be a conquered people,

1991
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:11,090
亨特先生  你们是本国公民
you will be citizens.

1992
02:07:12,150 --> 02:07:14,290
重新受到宪法法律约束
Returned to the laws

1993
02:07:14,290 --> 02:07:15,420
并享有宪法保障的权利的公民
and the guarantees of rights of the Constitution.

1994
02:07:16,070 --> 02:07:20,850
宪法废除奴隶制  扼杀我们的经济(内战时期美国南部种植园经济主要依赖奴隶生产)
Which now extinguishes slavery. And with it, our economy.

1995
02:07:21,690 --> 02:07:22,700
国会里睚眦必报的北方佬
All our laws will be determined

1996
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:24,980
将会制定我们的法律
by a Congress of vengeful Yankees.

1997
02:07:25,540 --> 02:07:28,670
最高法院里该死的共和党激进分子
All our rights'll be subject to a Supreme Court

1998
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:31,330
将会制约我们享有的权利
benched by bloody Republican radicals.

1999
02:07:31,550 --> 02:07:34,730
我们的传统会毁于一旦
All our traditions will be obliterated.

2000
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:37,490
我们甚至会忘记自己是谁
We won't know ourselves anymore.

2001
02:07:39,230 --> 02:07:41,770
我们不是来谈机构重组的
We ain't here to discuss reconstruction.

2002
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:44,420
我们没有法律依据来讨论这些
We have no legal basis for that discussion.

2003
02:07:44,450 --> 02:07:45,920
但我不想做不公平交易
But I don't want to deal falsely.

2004
02:07:45,990 --> 02:07:48,390
北方各州基本都会通过第13号修正案
The Northern states'll ratify, most of 'em.

2005
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:49,760
我认为
As I figure, it remains for

2006
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,570
就算全部回归之后
two of the Southern states to do the same,

2007
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:53,610
南方有两个州也会通过本案的
even after all are readmitted.

2008
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:55,360
我一直在努力争取
And I been working on that.

2009
02:07:55,880 --> 02:07:57,100
田纳西州跟路易斯安那州
Tennessee and Louisiana.

2010
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:59,810
很可能还有阿肯色州  法案会通过的
Arkansas too, most likely. It'll be ratified.

2011
02:08:00,270 --> 02:08:03,200
先生  奴隶制该寿终就寝了
Slavery, sir, it's done.

2012
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:19,590
如果我们将自己交诸法律  亚历克斯
If we submit ourselves to law, Alex,

2013
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:22,490
就算这样会使我们丧失某些自由
even submit to losing freedoms,

2014
02:08:23,270 --> 02:08:25,680
比如说压迫别人的自由
the freedom to oppress, for instance,

2015
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:30,400
但我们会发现其它之前不曾知道的自由
we may discover other freedoms previously unknown to us.

2016
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:34,430
只要你们对民主进程还抱有希望
Had you kept faith with democratic process,

2017
02:08:34,610 --> 02:08:37,610
不管道路多么曲折  好了  先生
- as frustrating as that can be - C'mon, sir,

2018
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:40,060
至少把这点虔诚留给我们吧
spare us at least these pieties.

2019
02:08:41,190 --> 02:08:43,450
你是通过民主选举战胜我们的吗
Did you defeat us with ballots?

2020
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:46,850
你是怎样控制联邦的
How've you held your Union together?

2021
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:48,520
通过民主政治吗
Through democracy?

2022
02:08:49,530 --> 02:08:50,610
在你的任期里
How many hundreds of thousands

2023
02:08:50,610 --> 02:08:53,140
有千千万万的人丧命
have died during your administration?

2024
02:08:54,170 --> 02:08:57,570
先生  你的联邦建立在炮火跟牺牲之上
Your Union, sir, is bonded in cannon fire and death.

2025
02:09:00,510 --> 02:09:02,340
你也许是对的
It may be you're right.

2026
02:09:06,510 --> 02:09:09,780
但我们所做的一切都是为了向世界展示
But say all we done is show the world

2027
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:11,510
民主并不是一团混乱
that democracy isn't chaos,

2028
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:19,530
有一种无形的伟大力量蕴于民众团结之中
that there is a great invisible strength in a people's union?

2029
02:09:20,120 --> 02:09:22,260
即使承受巨大的牺牲
Say we've shown that a people can endure

2030
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:25,350
我们也做到了团结一致
awful sacrifice and yet cohere?

2031
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:30,370
这难道还不够挽救人们对民主的信念
Mightn't that save at least the idea of democracy to aspire to?

2032
02:09:31,270 --> 02:09:33,670
并最终让他们觉得民主是值得的吗
Eventually, to become worthy of?

2033
02:09:37,790 --> 02:09:41,170
无论如何  流血和牺牲能证明的东西
At all rates, whatever may be proven by blood and sacrifice

2034
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:43,600
现在都已经证明
must've been proved by now.

2035
02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:56,390
我们能结束这场血战吗
Shall we stop this bleeding?

2036
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:26,750
弗吉尼亚州  彼得堡市外  4月3日

2037
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:38,130
投降之后  把战士们送回他们的家园
Once he surrenders, send his boys back to their homes,

2038
02:11:38,350 --> 02:11:40,610
他们的农场  他们的店铺
their farms, their shops.

2039
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:45,580
是的  先生  像我们说定的那样
Yes sir, as we discussed.

2040
02:11:45,650 --> 02:11:49,350
宽大处理  不要惩罚  我不想那样
Liberality all around. No punishment. I don't want that.

2041
02:11:50,010 --> 02:11:52,670
领头的那些  杰夫跟其他人
And the leaders, Jeff and the rest of 'em.

2042
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:54,930
就算他们趁我不留意逃到国外
If they escape, leave the country while my back's turned,

2043
02:11:54,930 --> 02:11:56,980
我也不会追究
that wouldn't upset me none.

2044
02:11:57,990 --> 02:12:00,750
和平不是表面工作
When peace comes it mustn't just be hangings.

2045
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:09,070
看看你的外表
By outward appearance,

2046
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:12,990
比去年老了十岁
you're ten years older than you were a year ago.

2047
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:19,490
疲倦已经深入骨髓了
Some weariness has bit at my bones.

2048
02:12:32,220 --> 02:12:36,230
我从未想过一切会是今天看到的这样
I never seen the like of it before. What I seen today.

2049
02:12:38,190 --> 02:12:40,590
从未想过
Never seen the like of it before.

2050
02:12:42,440 --> 02:12:46,940
你一直都知道  你知道会是这样
You always knew that what this was going to be.

2051
02:12:48,570 --> 02:12:50,970
尸体挨着尸体  面目全非
Intimate, and ugly.

2052
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:55,270
当你决定来这里的时候
You must've needed to see it close

2053
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:57,590
一定是想近距离看一看吧
when you decided to come down here.

2054
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:19,700
我们给了彼此机会去做可怕的事情
We've made it possible for one another to do terrible things.

2055
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:24,450
并且赢了这场战争
And we've won the war.

2056
02:13:24,930 --> 02:13:28,300
现在你必须带领我们走出它的阴影
Now you have to lead us out of it.

2057
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:45,530
阿波马托克斯郡府  弗吉尼亚州  1865年4月9日

2058
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:01,880
想去旅行吗
You've an itch to travel?

2059
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:04,880
挺想的
I'd like that.

2060
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:07,540
坐火车去西部
To the West by rail.

2061
02:15:07,820 --> 02:15:10,220
我说的去国外
Overseas.

2062
02:15:11,410 --> 02:15:12,970
去基督圣地[指巴勒斯坦]
The Holy Land.

2063
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,440
跟妻子在耶稣受难日
Awfully pious for a man

2064
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:20,350
坐马车出来兜风  你可真虔诚
who takes his wife out buggy-riding on Good Friday.

2065
02:15:20,570 --> 02:15:22,140
去耶路撒冷
Jerusalem.

2066
02:15:22,290 --> 02:15:24,400
大卫跟所罗门走过的地方
Where David and Solomon walked.

2067
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:28,340
我做梦都想踏上那座古城
I dream of walking in that ancient city.

2068
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:35,770
所有人都会认为我是个疯子
All anyone will remember of me is

2069
02:15:35,770 --> 02:15:38,580
我毁了你的幸福
I was crazy and I ruined your happiness.

2070
02:15:39,380 --> 02:15:42,650
这样想的人都不了解  玛丽
Anyone thinks that doesn't understand, Mary.

2071
02:15:45,730 --> 02:15:50,300
当人们看着你的时候  他们会想
When they look at you, at what it cost

2072
02:15:50,300 --> 02:15:53,940
付出怎样的代价才能得到他拥有的一切
to live at the heart of this, they'll wonder at it.

2073
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:56,280
他们会琢磨  这很正常
They'll wonder at you, they should.

2074
02:15:58,120 --> 02:16:00,920
但如果他们真的想知道个中滋味
But they should also look at the wretched woman by your side,

2075
02:16:00,930 --> 02:16:03,340
他们应该来看看你身旁这个可怜的女人
if they want to understand what this was truly like.

2076
02:16:05,020 --> 02:16:09,050
为了普通百姓  为了你之外的其他人
For the ordinary person. For anyone other than you.

2077
02:16:09,110 --> 02:16:11,110
我们要试着高兴起来
We must try to be happier.

2078
02:16:11,670 --> 02:16:13,710
两人都要高兴起来
We must. Both of us.

2079
02:16:14,050 --> 02:16:16,450
我们已经痛苦了太久了
We've been so miserable for so long.

2080
02:16:25,590 --> 02:16:27,990
我确实说过批准某些有色人种
I did say some colored men,

2081
02:16:28,210 --> 02:16:32,900
那些聪明的  受过教育的  打过仗的
the intelligent, the educated, and veterans, i qualified it.

2082
02:16:33,130 --> 02:16:34,050
史蒂文斯先生很愤怒
Mr. Stevens is furious.

2083
02:16:34,050 --> 02:16:36,460
他想知道你为什么会批准
He wants to know why you qualified it.

2084
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:38,940
没人听说过什么聪明的  受过教育的
No one's heard the intelligent or the educated part.

2085
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:40,430
他们听到的仅仅是
All they heard was the first time

2086
02:16:40,430 --> 02:16:43,460
历史上第一次有位总统提到了
any president has ever made mention

2087
02:16:43,730 --> 02:16:45,290
黑人选举权
of Negro voting.

2088
02:16:45,540 --> 02:16:49,210
我要是能说的更精彩一点就好了
Still, I wish I had mentioned it in a better speech.

2089
02:16:49,250 --> 02:16:50,450
史蒂文斯先生也想知道
Mr. Stevens also wants to know

2090
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:52,870
您为什么没有说的更精彩一点
why you didn't make a better speech.

2091
02:16:56,010 --> 02:16:57,820
林肯夫人在马车上等您
Mrs. Lincoln's waiting in the carriage.

2092
02:16:57,880 --> 02:16:59,470
她让我提醒您注意时间  您还要去接
She wants me to remind you of the hour,  and that

2093
02:16:59,480 --> 02:17:02,330
哈里斯小姐跟雷斯本上校
you'll have to pick up Miss Harris and Major Rathbone.

2094
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:08,140
我有麻烦了吗  没有  先生
- Am I in trouble? - No, sir.

2095
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:10,140
谢谢你  斯莱德先生
Thank you, Mr. Slade.

2096
02:17:25,380 --> 02:17:27,780
看样子我得走了
I suppose it's time to go,

2097
02:17:28,310 --> 02:17:29,870
虽然我更想留下
though I would rather stay.

2098
02:18:59,950 --> 02:19:02,430
总统被枪杀了
The President has been shot!

2099
02:19:05,510 --> 02:19:09,190
总统在福特剧院被枪杀了
The President has been shot at Ford's Theater!

2100
02:19:51,110 --> 02:19:54,410
现在是  4月15日  周六
It's 7:22 in the morning,

2101
02:19:55,480 --> 02:19:58,430
早上7点22分  一切都结束了
Saturday the 15th of April. It's all over.

2102
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:01,050
总统离开了人世
The President is no more.

2103
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:06,120
他已经归于历史长河
Now he belongs to the ages.

2104
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:17,640
我们温柔期待  我们热忱祈祷(1865年林肯第二次就职演讲)
Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray,

2105
02:20:19,110 --> 02:20:24,420
但愿这名为战争的灾祸可即刻消逝
that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.

2106
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:29,660
然而  如果上帝要延续这苦难
Yet, if God wills that it continue

2107
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:34,050
直到奴役之人数百年来
until all the wealth piled by the bondman's

2108
02:20:34,070 --> 02:20:39,040
以血汗堆积的财富化为乌有
two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk,

2109
02:20:40,380 --> 02:20:44,250
直到  如数千年前之人所讲
and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash

2110
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:48,470
鞭打出的血必得以刀刺出的血来偿还
shall be paid by another drawn with the sword,

2111
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:54,500
直到那时  我们仍旧低吟
as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said

2112
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:03,000
主之审判确是真实且公正的
The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

2113
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:09,830
我们全无恶意
With malice toward none,

2114
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:14,340
对所有人心怀仁爱
with charity for all,

2115
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:19,460
我们坚持正义  因上帝以正义启迪我们
with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right,

2116
02:21:19,490 --> 02:21:22,780
且让我们完成这未竟的事业
let us strive on to finish the work we are in,

2117
02:21:23,580 --> 02:21:25,980
平复这国家的创伤
to bind up the nation's wounds,

2118
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:31,620
慰藉那些战争中逝去的英灵
to care for him who shall have borne the battle,

2119
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:36,040
照顾烈士的遗孀及孤儿
and for his widow and his orphan,

2120
02:21:37,780 --> 02:21:42,330
尽一切努力
to do all which may achieve

2121
02:21:43,090 --> 02:21:48,420
以求在本国及世界范围内
and cherish a just and a lasting peace

2122
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:51,750
保障公平正义及世代和平
among ourselves and with all nations.
