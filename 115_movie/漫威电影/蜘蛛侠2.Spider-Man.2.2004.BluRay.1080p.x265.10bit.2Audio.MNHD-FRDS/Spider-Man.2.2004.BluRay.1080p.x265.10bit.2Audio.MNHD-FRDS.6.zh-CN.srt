1
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,248
She looks at me every day.

2
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,213
Mary Jane Watson.

3
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:07,412
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.

4
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:09,386
But she can never know.

5
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:12,993
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.

6
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:15,459
A life she can never be a part of.

7
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,927
Who am I?

8
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:19,692
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.

9
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:22,860
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.

10
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,595
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:27,007
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:31,105
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

13
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:34,214
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,646
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:39,616
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:43,349
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:46,426
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

18
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,529
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

19
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:52,359
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

20
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:55,935
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

21
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:59,835
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

22
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,072
This is your last chance.

23
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:06,976
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

24
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:10,583
Go!

25
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:34,399
Hey, what, are you stupid?

26
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:59,527
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

27
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:09,835
I'm gonna get it!

28
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,792
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

29
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:29,224
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

30
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,192
See you.

31
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:33,629
Way to go, Spidey!

32
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:28,421
Pizza time.

33
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:34,753
You're late.

34
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:37,028
I'm not paying for those.

35
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:58,975
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

36
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:03,781
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

37
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,949
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

38
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:08,561
-You're fired. Go.
-Please, I need this job.

39
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,358
-You're fired.
-Look, give me another chance.

40
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:21,806
You're fired.

41
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:22,310
-Parker, hello. You're fired.
-Why?

42
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,210
-Parker, hello. You're fired.
-Why?

43
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:25,846
Dogs catching Frisbees?

44
00:07:26,014 --> 00:07:28,312
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

45
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:29,711
-Boss.
-Not now.

46
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:32,614
The Bugle could show another side
of New York for a change.

47
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:35,722
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

48
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,291
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you-- Still not now!

49
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,054
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

50
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,722
He won't let me take any more pictures.
You turned the whole city against him.

51
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,390
A fact I'm very proud of.

52
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:51,334
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

53
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:54,873
-It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
-Thanks for the good news.

54
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:58,376
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

55
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,578
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

56
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,444
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

57
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:06,280
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

58
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:08,319
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

59
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,855
-Some food got poisoned?
-I'm a little nauseous.

60
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,890
All right, Mr. Jameson.

61
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,756
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

62
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:18,558
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

63
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,200
I told you, he's not a menace.

64
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:22,130
-I told you--
-I'll take care of it.

65
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:23,861
-I'll give you 1 50.
-Three hundred.

66
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:25,534
That's outrageous.

67
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:27,675
Done. Give this to the girl.

68
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,104
Thank you. Bye-bye.

69
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,000
Hi.

70
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:32,678
Hey, Pete.

71
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:39,517
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

72
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,822
-Right.
-Sorry.

73
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,252
Hey.

74
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,317
Chin up, okay?

75
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:00,907
Watch it, jerk!

76
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:13,451
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

77
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:15,213
Where were you headed, Parker?

78
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:16,684
To your class.

79
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:18,689
My class is over.

80
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,055
See me standing here?

81
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:25,029
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

82
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:26,530
Then be here.

83
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,369
Look at you, Peter.

84
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:34,238
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

85
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,309
You always appear exhausted.

86
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,805
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

87
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:44,110
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

88
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:47,446
Planning is not a major
at this university.

89
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:52,783
Octavius is a friend of mine.

90
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,118
Better do your research, Parker.

91
00:09:55,463 --> 00:09:58,626
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

92
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,181
Surprise!

93
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,290
Well, say something.

94
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,720
What's the occasion?

95
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,453
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

96
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,794
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

97
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,465
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

98
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,570
-Hi, M.J.
-Hi.

99
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:39,437
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

100
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:40,835
Long time, no see.

101
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,870
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

102
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:46,741
It's going fine. It's going good.

103
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:48,176
She's brilliant in it.

104
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:50,010
Harry sent me roses.

105
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:52,744
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

106
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:56,087
I've been busy.

107
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:59,818
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

108
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,962
The less you see of that man,
the better.

109
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,587
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

110
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,028
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

111
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:09,328
So how are things going at Oscorp?

112
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,370
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

113
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,667
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

114
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:19,039
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

115
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:20,510
Thank you.

116
00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:24,612
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

117
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:27,276
-I'm writing a paper on him.
-You want to meet him?

118
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:28,717
You'd introduce me?

119
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,087
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

120
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,285
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

121
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:36,396
M.J., could you give me a hand?

122
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,358
She's waiting for you, pal.

123
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,296
What do you mean?

124
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,938
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

125
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:46,838
However you want to look at it.

126
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,369
I don't have time for girls right now.

127
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,874
Why, are you dead?

128
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,535
I've been kind of busy.

129
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,407
Taking pictures of your friend?

130
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,407
Could we get off that subject?

131
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,911
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

132
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,715
Then be honest with me.

133
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,590
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

134
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,706
May.

135
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:32,443
Oh, what, Ben?

136
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:35,722
Wait.

137
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:37,356
-Aunt May.
-Oh, my.

138
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:42,991
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

139
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,133
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

140
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:49,229
Did they have a good time?

141
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:50,999
I'm sure they did.

142
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,674
-You okay?
-Of course. But you go home.

143
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,443
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

144
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,345
I'm worried about you.

145
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:09,687
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

146
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:12,415
Oh, my. You did?

147
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:14,258
Oh, well.

148
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:15,861
So?

149
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,057
I'm a little behind.

150
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,795
Everybody is.

151
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:24,471
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

152
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:28,369
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

153
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,635
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

154
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:34,639
You need it more than I do.

155
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,340
-No, I can't take that from you.
-Yes, you can!

156
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:39,543
You can take this money from me.

157
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,450
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

158
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:45,114
And don't you dare leave it here.

159
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,226
Oh, I'm sorry.

160
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:51,956
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

161
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:58,972
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

162
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,503
I think to myself at times...

163
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,978
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, l'd....

164
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,042
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

165
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,184
Now...

166
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:24,826
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.

167
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,070
Hey.

168
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,409
Hey. You're still here.

169
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:46,146
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

170
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:49,618
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

171
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,886
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

172
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:58,929
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

173
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,931
Oh, boy, yeah.

174
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:06,506
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

175
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,672
Nothing.

176
00:15:16,951 --> 00:15:18,885
Do you want to say something?

177
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:26,484
I...

178
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:33,695
...was...

179
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:37,967
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.

180
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,139
You're such a mystery.

181
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,190
Peter.

182
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:04,120
What?

183
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:10,832
Happy birthday.

184
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:21,674
I'm seeing somebody now.

185
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,682
You mean, like a boyfriend?

186
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:27,514
Well, like I like him.

187
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:32,055
What?

188
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:34,451
Nothing.

189
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,560
That's good, you know?
Companionship....

190
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,928
May be more than that.

191
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:44,595
More?

192
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,772
I don't know.

193
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,338
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

194
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,349
-You're coming?
-I'll be there.

195
00:16:57,318 --> 00:16:59,013
Don't disappoint me.

196
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,115
I won't.

197
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,827
Rent.

198
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:24,337
-Hi.
-Hi. What's "hi"?

199
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,035
Can I spend it?

200
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,680
I have a paycheck due this week
and--

201
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:32,182
-You're a month late again. Again.
-I promise as soon as--

202
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,853
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

203
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:40,951
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All I got
is this 20 for the rest of the week.

204
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:43,153
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

205
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,199
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

206
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,770
-Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
-Hi, Pete.

207
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,178
Hello?

208
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,257
Rent?

209
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:57,735
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

210
00:18:57,905 --> 00:19:01,807
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

211
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,736
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

212
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:05,708
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

213
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,176
Who do we have here?

214
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:09,077
This is my good friend
I called you about.

215
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,910
He got me through
high-school science.

216
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:14,077
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for--

217
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:15,687
I know what you're doing here...

218
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:18,120
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

219
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,924
But Oscorp pays the bills, so....

220
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,427
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

221
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:26,964
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

222
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:31,730
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

223
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,931
Interesting fellow, your friend.

224
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:38,238
I won't take much of your time.

225
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:42,781
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

226
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:45,677
He also tells me you're lazy.

227
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:47,915
I'm trying to do better.

228
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:51,683
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

229
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:55,188
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

230
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,489
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

231
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,131
You want to try it back there?

232
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,525
So is that it?

233
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:06,105
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

234
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,407
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

235
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:10,941
Sympathetic frequencies.

236
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:13,136
Harmonic reinforcement?

237
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,209
Go on.

238
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:19,310
An exponential increase
in energy output.

239
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,147
A huge amount of energy.

240
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:25,485
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

241
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:28,890
Are you sure you could stabilize
the fusion reaction?

242
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,395
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

243
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,897
This is my life's work.

244
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:38,400
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

245
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,836
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.

246
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:44,375
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

247
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,375
You can sleep soundly tonight.

248
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:48,276
Otto's done his homework.

249
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:51,543
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

250
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,214
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

251
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:56,549
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

252
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:59,356
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

253
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,653
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?

254
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:05,128
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

255
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,790
Rosie, I love this boy.

256
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:11,734
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

257
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:14,364
Well....

258
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:16,875
I don't really know.

259
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:20,138
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

260
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,349
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

261
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:25,417
Love should never be a secret.

262
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:28,851
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

263
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,217
...gonna make you sick.

264
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:33,656
I finally got lucky in love.

265
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:35,158
We both did.

266
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:39,026
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

267
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:42,896
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

268
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,335
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

269
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:49,670
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

270
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:52,334
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

271
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,581
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

272
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:56,977
-Yes, you do.
-I'm serious.

273
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,677
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

274
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:05,191
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

275
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:06,854
Poetry.

276
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:09,523
Never fails.

277
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:17,036
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie

278
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:19,570
Brightest green were all her garments

279
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,106
And her hair was like the sunshine

280
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,171
Day by day he gazed upon her

281
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,029
Rent!

282
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:27,634
Where is my money?!

283
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,598
You seem jittery tonight.

284
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,532
You never know who's coming.

285
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:15,855
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

286
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,371
How'd you do that?

287
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:39,675
Work out, plenty of rest.

288
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:41,778
You know, eat your green vegetables.

289
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:46,210
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

290
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:50,387
Come on. Go.

291
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:54,725
Keep it steady.

292
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,740
It's a web.

293
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,515
Go, Spidey, go!

294
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,860
We got trouble!

295
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:51,451
Get me down!

296
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:54,985
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

297
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:58,454
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

298
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,752
Then you think we should
forgive them?

299
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,291
Yes.

300
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,289
I mean, no.

301
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:15,871
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

302
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:17,874
Whatever.

303
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,072
Shoelace.

304
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,213
You might want to....

305
00:26:33,627 --> 00:26:37,757
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, I've come to see the show.

306
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:41,731
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

307
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,267
It helps maintain the illusion.

308
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:50,042
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

309
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,700
But not to come late.

310
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:57,605
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the--

311
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,465
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man

312
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,625
A-does whatever a spider can

313
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:19,795
A-spins a web, any size

314
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,339
Catches thieves a-just like flies

315
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:25,740
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

316
00:27:41,595 --> 00:27:44,155
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

317
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:45,696
Yeah, I'm sure.

318
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:47,766
-Okay. Call me.
-I will.

319
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:49,663
-You were great tonight.
-Thanks.

320
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:54,732
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

321
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,373
What are you doing here?

322
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:13,720
You hungry?

323
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:15,122
Starved.

324
00:29:05,712 --> 00:29:07,680
What was that?

325
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:13,915
Okay.

326
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:55,018
Cool Spidey outfit.

327
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:58,091
Thanks.

328
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,362
Where'd you get it?

329
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:04,033
I made it.

330
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,599
Looks uncomfortable.

331
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,105
Yeah, it gets kind of itchy.

332
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:19,376
And it rides up in the crotch
a little bit too.

333
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:13,500
Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

334
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,602
Hi, M.J.

335
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:17,072
This is Peter.

336
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,670
I was on my way to your show and....

337
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:25,417
Well, I was on my bike....

338
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:29,945
Are you there?

339
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:35,459
I really was planning on it all day.

340
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,287
And...

341
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:42,031
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

342
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:43,995
Bingo.

343
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:46,699
It's amazing, isn't it?

344
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:50,474
How complicated a simple thing...

345
00:31:51,678 --> 00:31:55,774
...Iike being someplace at 8:00
can become.

346
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:03,522
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.

347
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,318
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

348
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:09,018
Your time has expired.

349
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:13,427
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.

350
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:25,236
I wanna tell you the truth.

351
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,813
Here it is.

352
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:31,476
I'm Spider-Man.

353
00:32:32,652 --> 00:32:34,017
Weird, huh?

354
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:38,187
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

355
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:43,989
If my enemies found out about you...

356
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:50,064
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

357
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:58,934
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

358
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:11,718
Ladies and gentlemen...

359
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:15,725
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

360
00:33:15,895 --> 00:33:17,556
But first, before we start...

361
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:22,099
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

362
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:24,025
Because we found the rubber band.

363
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:30,141
It's a terrible joke.

364
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,039
But thank you for coming.

365
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:33,606
Today...

366
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:38,308
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

367
00:33:38,618 --> 00:33:43,817
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

368
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:48,423
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

369
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:59,027
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

370
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:02,663
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

371
00:34:02,842 --> 00:34:05,367
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

372
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:54,823
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

373
00:34:55,495 --> 00:34:58,293
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

374
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:02,560
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

375
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:05,568
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

376
00:35:05,738 --> 00:35:08,172
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

377
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:10,138
...is as advanced as you suggest...

378
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,335
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

379
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,774
How right you are.

380
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,005
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

381
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:18,548
...to protect
my higher brain function.

382
00:35:18,718 --> 00:35:23,178
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

383
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,821
And now on to the main event.

384
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:27,892
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

385
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:51,347
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

386
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:54,645
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

387
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:59,486
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp lndustries for providing it.

388
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:01,557
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

389
00:36:15,408 --> 00:36:16,898
Ladies and gentlemen...

390
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:21,310
...fasten your seat belts.

391
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:42,659
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

392
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,773
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

393
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:52,171
Thank you.

394
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:54,245
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

395
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:03,785
The power of the sun...

396
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:06,551
...in the palm of my hand.

397
00:37:28,181 --> 00:37:30,741
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

398
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,748
It'll soon stabilize!

399
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:41,222
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

400
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:48,432
We have a containment breach!

401
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,230
Otto, please get back!

402
00:37:54,207 --> 00:37:57,040
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

403
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,038
It will stabilize! It's under control!

404
00:38:00,213 --> 00:38:02,078
I'm in charge here!

405
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:05,081
It's my money! I'm in con--

406
00:38:08,688 --> 00:38:10,713
This doesn't change anything.

407
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:16,427
-What are you doing?
-Pulling the plug.

408
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:18,057
No!

409
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:38,574
Rosie!

410
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:10,443
Watch it.

411
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:11,844
That was too close.

412
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:16,079
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

413
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:22,893
I'm ruined.

414
00:39:24,564 --> 00:39:27,055
I have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

415
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:28,894
He saved your life, sir.

416
00:39:29,335 --> 00:39:31,735
He humiliated me by touching me.

417
00:39:31,904 --> 00:39:34,498
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

418
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:36,574
What was he doing here anyway?

419
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:55,425
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

420
00:39:55,595 --> 00:39:57,722
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

421
00:39:57,897 --> 00:40:00,457
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

422
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:02,794
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

423
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:05,938
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

424
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:08,471
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

425
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:11,906
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T1 2.

426
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:13,475
We're ready, doctor.

427
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:18,613
Anybody here take shop class?

428
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:03,692
Help me! Help me!

429
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:18,259
No!

430
00:43:09,722 --> 00:43:12,589
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.

431
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:14,919
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

432
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:17,892
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

433
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:21,055
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

434
00:43:21,534 --> 00:43:26,198
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

435
00:43:26,372 --> 00:43:27,600
Hoffman!

436
00:43:29,642 --> 00:43:31,075
What are we gonna call this guy?

437
00:43:31,243 --> 00:43:33,507
-"Dr. Octopus."
-That's crap.

438
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,237
-"Science Squid"?
-Crap!

439
00:43:35,848 --> 00:43:37,509
-"Dr. Strange."
-That's pretty good.

440
00:43:38,317 --> 00:43:42,515
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

441
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,984
-I like it.
-Of course you do.

442
00:43:45,157 --> 00:43:48,888
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

443
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:51,052
-Genius.
-What, are you looking for a raise?

444
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,891
Get out.

445
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,861
Chief, I found Parker.

446
00:43:55,034 --> 00:43:57,229
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

447
00:43:57,403 --> 00:43:59,701
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

448
00:43:59,872 --> 00:44:01,169
I heard Spider-Man was there.

449
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:04,935
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

450
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,407
Chief, the planetarium party.

451
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:08,274
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

452
00:44:08,447 --> 00:44:10,005
What do you know
about high society?

453
00:44:10,182 --> 00:44:12,480
-Oh. Well, l--
-Don't answer that.

454
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:16,087
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

455
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:19,224
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

456
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:21,154
Could you pay me in advance?

457
00:44:30,202 --> 00:44:32,636
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

458
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:35,467
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

459
00:44:50,556 --> 00:44:52,285
My Rosie's dead.

460
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,223
My dream is dead.

461
00:44:59,932 --> 00:45:01,194
And these...

462
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:06,694
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

463
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:10,940
...along with me.

464
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:21,512
Something...

465
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:24,478
...in my head.

466
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,718
Something talking.

467
00:45:33,766 --> 00:45:35,233
The inhibitor chip!

468
00:45:38,637 --> 00:45:40,195
Gone.

469
00:45:44,977 --> 00:45:46,274
Rebuild.

470
00:45:49,682 --> 00:45:51,343
No.

471
00:45:52,551 --> 00:45:53,984
Peter was right.

472
00:45:56,322 --> 00:45:57,914
I miscalculated.

473
00:46:04,496 --> 00:46:06,555
I couldn't have miscalculated.

474
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:09,600
It was working, wasn't it?

475
00:46:14,506 --> 00:46:15,905
Yes.

476
00:46:16,976 --> 00:46:19,968
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

477
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,409
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

478
00:46:23,282 --> 00:46:25,113
But we need money.

479
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:28,216
Steal it?

480
00:46:28,387 --> 00:46:30,218
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

481
00:46:32,825 --> 00:46:34,156
That's right.

482
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:39,292
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

483
00:46:42,935 --> 00:46:44,562
We'll do it here.

484
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:48,603
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

485
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:51,398
Nothing will stand in our way.

486
00:46:51,577 --> 00:46:52,908
Nothing!

487
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,944
-That's the social security.
-Yes, I see.

488
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:02,948
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

489
00:47:03,122 --> 00:47:05,352
Yes, but I'm afraid...

490
00:47:05,524 --> 00:47:08,618
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

491
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:12,419
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

492
00:47:12,631 --> 00:47:13,893
You are?

493
00:47:19,038 --> 00:47:22,269
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

494
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:25,035
...a new supersaver account
with us today.

495
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,472
But the fact is...

496
00:47:26,645 --> 00:47:30,979
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

497
00:47:31,617 --> 00:47:33,175
Well....

498
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:36,784
At least we get the toaster.

499
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:40,982
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

500
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:45,160
Oh, yes, I see.

501
00:47:46,632 --> 00:47:48,259
Okay.

502
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:53,429
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

503
00:48:10,756 --> 00:48:12,087
Peter?

504
00:48:13,826 --> 00:48:15,851
Don't leave me.

505
00:48:16,662 --> 00:48:19,096
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

506
00:48:19,598 --> 00:48:20,826
Hold it!

507
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,262
Put your arms up! All of them!

508
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:48,856
Here's your change!

509
00:48:58,837 --> 00:49:00,395
Oh, no. Come on!

510
00:49:13,752 --> 00:49:15,947
-You're getting on my nerves.
-I have a knack for that.

511
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:17,713
Not anymore.

512
00:49:47,486 --> 00:49:49,249
-Freeze! Don't move!
-Freeze!

513
00:49:53,192 --> 00:49:55,023
-Hold your fire!
-Don't follow me.

514
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:00,694
Wait a second.

515
00:50:18,417 --> 00:50:20,715
-Hand her over.
-Of course.

516
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:22,715
Easy, now.

517
00:50:24,423 --> 00:50:26,118
Butterfingers.

518
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:39,665
Look out!

519
00:50:41,907 --> 00:50:43,807
Help me!

520
00:50:45,911 --> 00:50:48,505
-Help me!
-I'm coming!

521
00:50:53,752 --> 00:50:55,652
Hang on!

522
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:14,837
Help!

523
00:51:34,693 --> 00:51:36,354
Thank you.

524
00:51:39,598 --> 00:51:40,929
Aunt May.

525
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:44,091
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

526
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:47,295
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

527
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:54,471
Come on.

528
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:00,576
Shame on you.

529
00:52:33,018 --> 00:52:34,645
There you go.

530
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,953
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

531
00:52:39,124 --> 00:52:40,386
We sure showed him.

532
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,322
What do you mean, "we"?

533
00:52:46,465 --> 00:52:48,831
-Take me with you, Spider-Man.
-Take me.

534
00:53:16,261 --> 00:53:18,923
-May l?
-Sure. Go ahead.

535
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,831
Penny! Over here!

536
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:28,729
Leave it.

537
00:53:32,778 --> 00:53:35,269
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

538
00:53:35,447 --> 00:53:36,778
Why? It's a party.

539
00:53:36,948 --> 00:53:39,883
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

540
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:43,384
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

541
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:45,450
Not to mention your friend the bug.

542
00:53:46,024 --> 00:53:47,252
Not tonight, Harry.

543
00:53:47,426 --> 00:53:50,884
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24-7.

544
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:52,829
Parker!

545
00:53:53,498 --> 00:53:54,726
Parker!

546
00:53:55,267 --> 00:53:58,327
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

547
00:53:58,503 --> 00:54:00,437
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?

548
00:54:00,672 --> 00:54:02,640
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.

549
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:04,303
Beautiful tie.

550
00:54:04,476 --> 00:54:06,740
Get a shot of us with the DA.

551
00:54:07,145 --> 00:54:08,635
Beautiful dress.

552
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,810
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

553
00:54:13,151 --> 00:54:14,743
Wife.

554
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:19,019
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

555
00:54:19,191 --> 00:54:22,251
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

556
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:24,657
...is pleased to present
our guest of honor.

557
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:28,561
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

558
00:54:29,668 --> 00:54:32,831
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

559
00:54:33,004 --> 00:54:34,869
...Captain John Jameson.

560
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,075
Hi.

561
00:55:23,388 --> 00:55:26,755
-You.
-Listen, I'm sorry.

562
00:55:26,925 --> 00:55:29,052
But there was a disturbance.

563
00:55:29,294 --> 00:55:30,625
I don't know you.

564
00:55:32,597 --> 00:55:36,533
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

565
00:55:37,402 --> 00:55:39,097
I've been reading poetry lately.

566
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:40,670
Whatever that means.

567
00:55:41,139 --> 00:55:44,666
Day by day he gazed upon her

568
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:47,909
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day--

569
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,944
Don't start.

570
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:53,077
Can I get you a drink?

571
00:55:53,318 --> 00:55:55,115
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

572
00:55:55,787 --> 00:55:57,414
John.

573
00:55:57,589 --> 00:56:01,491
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

574
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,629
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

575
00:56:04,796 --> 00:56:07,287
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

576
00:56:07,465 --> 00:56:08,693
Even my father.

577
00:56:09,935 --> 00:56:12,631
He came backstage to borrow cash.

578
00:56:14,272 --> 00:56:18,641
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

579
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,971
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

580
00:56:22,647 --> 00:56:24,239
After all these years...

581
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:28,144
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

582
00:56:53,645 --> 00:56:57,012
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

583
00:56:57,182 --> 00:57:00,447
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

584
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:02,610
-Take it easy.
-Don't push me.

585
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:04,652
Don't act like you're my friend.

586
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:07,391
You stole M.J. from me.

587
00:57:07,726 --> 00:57:09,694
You stole my father's love.

588
00:57:10,362 --> 00:57:15,356
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

589
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:18,831
Huh? Isn't that right?

590
00:57:19,004 --> 00:57:20,801
Huh, brother?

591
00:57:31,783 --> 00:57:34,513
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

592
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:39,680
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

593
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:51,668
What a surprise.

594
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:54,737
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

595
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:24,097
Oh, no. No!

596
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,341
Why is this happening to me?

597
01:00:04,669 --> 01:00:06,637
You seem very okay to me.

598
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:08,703
My diagnosis?

599
01:00:09,207 --> 01:00:10,674
It's up here.

600
01:00:13,378 --> 01:00:17,405
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

601
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:21,313
There is one dream where...

602
01:00:21,753 --> 01:00:23,220
...in my dream...

603
01:00:24,389 --> 01:00:25,754
...I'm Spider-Man.

604
01:00:26,157 --> 01:00:30,594
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

605
01:00:34,332 --> 01:00:35,924
So you're Spider-Man.

606
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,328
In my dream.

607
01:00:37,502 --> 01:00:41,871
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

608
01:00:44,175 --> 01:00:45,767
Somebody else's dream.

609
01:00:51,549 --> 01:00:53,449
What about this friend?

610
01:00:53,618 --> 01:00:56,951
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

611
01:00:57,455 --> 01:01:01,391
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

612
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:05,792
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

613
01:01:05,964 --> 01:01:07,727
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

614
01:01:08,533 --> 01:01:10,091
Listen...

615
01:01:11,002 --> 01:01:15,234
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

616
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:17,402
That's why you keep falling.

617
01:01:19,878 --> 01:01:21,812
You always have a choice, Peter.

618
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:25,743
I have a choice.

619
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:37,851
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...

620
01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:40,396
...make me sad.

621
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,834
Can't you understand?

622
01:01:44,569 --> 01:01:46,867
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

623
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:50,733
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

624
01:01:51,342 --> 01:01:54,004
...fairness, justice....

625
01:01:54,746 --> 01:01:59,479
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

626
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:03,585
...to take those dreams
out into the world.

627
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:07,249
I can't live your dreams anymore.

628
01:02:08,426 --> 01:02:10,257
I want a life of my own.

629
01:02:10,428 --> 01:02:12,555
You've been given a gift, Peter.

630
01:02:12,864 --> 01:02:17,096
With great power
comes great responsibility.

631
01:02:21,706 --> 01:02:23,367
Take my hand, son.

632
01:02:36,621 --> 01:02:38,282
No, Uncle Ben.

633
01:02:40,391 --> 01:02:42,621
I'm just Peter Parker.

634
01:02:44,395 --> 01:02:46,124
I'm Spider-Man...

635
01:02:46,998 --> 01:02:48,522
...no more.

636
01:02:49,701 --> 01:02:51,100
No more.

637
01:02:59,344 --> 01:03:00,811
No more.

638
01:04:29,801 --> 01:04:31,962
-You punk!
-Sorry.

639
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:34,535
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

640
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:43,207
Hurry up!

641
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:56,587
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

642
01:04:56,761 --> 01:04:58,490
Someone, please?

643
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:02,961
.23 electron volts.

644
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:11,106
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

645
01:05:21,786 --> 01:05:21,886
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

646
01:05:21,886 --> 01:05:24,684
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

647
01:05:24,856 --> 01:05:27,689
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

648
01:05:27,859 --> 01:05:29,827
...in a very inexcusable manner.

649
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:32,155
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

650
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:35,527
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

651
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,463
That would be hypocrisy.

652
01:05:38,503 --> 01:05:40,903
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

653
01:05:46,711 --> 01:05:48,201
"l am glad."

654
01:05:49,046 --> 01:05:51,071
"l am glad."

655
01:05:51,382 --> 01:05:53,145
"l am glad."

656
01:05:54,986 --> 01:05:57,113
Are you glad to hear it?

657
01:05:59,323 --> 01:06:01,655
I am glad...

658
01:06:01,826 --> 01:06:03,293
...to hear it.

659
01:06:03,461 --> 01:06:05,156
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

660
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:08,958
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.

661
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:13,819
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

662
01:06:13,986 --> 01:06:16,011
You could've told me
you were coming.

663
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:18,520
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

664
01:06:22,261 --> 01:06:23,922
You look different.

665
01:06:24,663 --> 01:06:29,600
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

666
01:06:29,768 --> 01:06:31,633
I do my homework now.

667
01:06:33,772 --> 01:06:35,603
You wanna get some chow mein?

668
01:06:35,774 --> 01:06:37,173
Peter...

669
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:38,060
...I'm getting married.

670
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,618
...I'm getting married.

671
01:06:44,566 --> 01:06:47,467
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

672
01:06:47,769 --> 01:06:49,430
And who's the groom?

673
01:06:49,771 --> 01:06:51,466
You hadn't decided yet.

674
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:56,002
You think just because
you saw my play...

675
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,578
...you can talk me out
of getting married?

676
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:02,044
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

677
01:07:02,217 --> 01:07:05,709
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

678
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,746
You're too late.
