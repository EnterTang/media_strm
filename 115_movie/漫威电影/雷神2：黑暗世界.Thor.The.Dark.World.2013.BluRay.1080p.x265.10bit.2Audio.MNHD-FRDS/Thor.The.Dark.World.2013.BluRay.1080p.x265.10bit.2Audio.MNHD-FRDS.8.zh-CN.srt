3
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,631
远在光明尚未诞生之际 世界充满黑暗
Long before the birth of light, there was darkness.

4
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,839
在这无尽的黑暗中 孕育着黑暗精灵一族
And from that darkness came the Dark Elves.

5
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,432
数千年之前 族中最为残暴的精灵首领 玛勒基斯
Millennia ago, the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith

6
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,437
企图摧毁九界 使整个宇宙重新回到无尽的黑夜
sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night.

7
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:00,611
因为他拥有足以毁天灭地的上古力量 以太粒子
Such evil was possible through the power of the Aether,

8
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,486
所以这并非痴人说梦
an ancient force of infinite destruction.

9
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:08,943
玛勒基斯
Malekith.

10
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,662
阿斯加德的部队来了
Asgard's forces are upon us.

11
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,380
我的父王博尔亲自率领高贵的阿斯加德军团
The noble armies of Asgard, led by my father, King Bor,

12
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,424
讨伐这群邪恶的生物
waged a mighty war against these creatures.

13
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,687
派献祭者出战!
Send in the Kursed!

14
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,368
当九界在他眼前汇聚于一线
As the Nine Worlds converged above him,

15
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,840
玛勒基斯终于如愿以偿释放以太
Malekith could at last unleash the Aether.

16
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,147
啊!
Ahh!

17
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,229
但是阿斯加德的军队从他手里夺下了武器
But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp.

18
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,944
黑暗精灵一族也随之倒下
Without it, the Dark Elves fell.

19
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,923
眼看大势已去
With the battle all but lost,

20
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,585
玛勒基斯孤注一掷 不惜族人性命
Malekith sacrificed his own people

21
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,468
丧心病狂地与阿斯加德的军队展开殊死决战
in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army.

22
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,644
他们死了 我们才能活
Their deaths will mean our survival.

23
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,098
这场战争还远未结束
This war is far from over.

24
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,328
玛勒基斯战败了 以太也不复存在
Malekith was vanquished, and the Aether was no more.

25
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,239
或者说是我们自欺欺人地这样认为
Or so we were led to believe.

26
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,044
陛下 要把以太毁了吗?
Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?

27
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,081
我也希望如此
If only we could.

28
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,090
但是它的力量太过强大
But its power is too great.

29
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,169
把它深埋地下
Bury it deep.

30
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,717
埋到谁都找不到的地方
Somewhere no one will ever find it.

31
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:48,217
雷神2: 黑暗世界

32
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,551
洛基
Loki.

33
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,264
你好 母后
Hello, Mother.

34
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,638
替我自豪吗?
Have I made you proud?

35
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,179
别再越弄越糟了
Please, don't make this worse.

36
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,105
怎么算"糟"
Define "worse".

37
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,857
够了!
Enough!

38
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,314
我要和犯人单独说话
I will speak to the prisoner alone.

39
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,709
我真不知道这样小题大做都是为了啥
I really don't see what all the fuss is about.

40
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,247
难道你还没意识到自己已犯下了滔天大罪?
Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes?

41
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,215
你所到之处 生灵涂炭 满目疮痍
Wherever you go, there is war, ruin,

42
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,377
血流成河
and death.

43
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,764
我只不过去凡间当了回他们仁慈的神
I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent god.

44
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,100
像您一样
Just like you.

45
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,055
我们不是神 我们也有生老病死
We are not gods. We are born, we live, we die.

46
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,602
与凡人无异
Just as humans do.

47
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,935
也就比他们多活5000年而已
Give or take 5,000 years.

48
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,856
一切都因你 洛基 觊觎王位而起
All this because Loki desires a throne.

49
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,365
我命中注定有争夺王位的权利
It is my birthright.

50
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,869
你命中注定本是死亡
Your birthright was to die

51
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,908
年少而亡
as a child.

52
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,499
你被丢弃在冰冷的岩石上
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

53
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,628
如果我没把你带回来
If I had not taken you in,

54
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,415
你连站在这恨我的机会都没有
you would not be here now to hate me.

55
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,791
如果我该死 那么求求你 
If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake,

56
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,295
快动手吧
just swing it.

57
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,671
我不是不喜欢和你说话
It's not that I don't love our little talks,

58
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,595
只是...
it's just...

59
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,348
我不喜欢他们
I don't love them.

60
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,761
要不是你的母后芙蕾嘉 你早就被处死了
Frigga is the only reason you're still alive,

61
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,184
而你再也不会见到她了
and you will never see her again.

62
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,399
你的余生都会在地牢中渡过
You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.

63
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,650
那索尔呢?
And what of Thor?

64
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,870
你要让那个白痴登基 却让我在枷锁里腐烂
You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains.

65
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,532
索尔会收拾完你留下的烂摊子
Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done.

66
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,219
他要帮九界恢复秩序
He will bring order to the Nine Realms

67
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,335
然后 没错...
and then, yes...

68
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,168
他会登基为王
he will be king.

69
00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:18,008
华纳海姆

70
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,008
啊!
Ah!

71
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,262
一切都在我的掌控之中!
I've got this completely under control!

72
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,469
所以到处都在着火?
Is that why everything is on fire?

73
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,439
啊!
Ah!

74
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,036
不用谢
You're welcome.

75
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,702
啊!
Ha!

76
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,767
交给你了
All yours.

77
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,370
你好
Hello.

78
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,295
我接受你的投降
I accept your surrender.

79
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,522
还有谁?
Anyone else?

80
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,947
下次咱应该从大家伙开始
Perhaps next time we should start with the big one.

81
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,158
快走 快!
Keep moving. Come on!

82
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,092
赶紧走 走前边 不准回头!
Keep moving. Go ahead of me. Don't you turn around!

83
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,879
接下来去哪?
Where do we go next?

84
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:10,017
霍根 九界即将重归和平
Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms.

85
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,683
你应该留在这 和你关心的人民在一起
You should stay here. Be with your people, where your heart is.

86
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,438
不着急回阿斯加德
Asgard can wait.

87
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,816
真是感激不尽
You have my thanks.

88
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,649
我也要感谢你
As you have mine.

89
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,450
海姆达尔 让我上去
Heimdall, when you're ready.

90
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:44,450
阿斯加德

91
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,368
华纳海姆安全了?
Is Vanaheim secure?

92
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,999
和诺恩海姆还有瑞亚一样安全
As are Nornheim and Ria.

93
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,841
要是您能亲自出马 战争肯定早结束了
Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.

94
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,878
你今天肯定是蜂蜜吃多了 不然嘴巴怎么这么甜
You must think I'm a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily.

95
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,126
我说的都是实话
That was not my intent.

96
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,710
这是彩虹桥被摧毁以后
For the first time since Bifrost was destroyed,

97
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,509
九界首次重归和平
the Nine Realms are at peace.

98
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,095
他们会牢记我们的实力
They're well reminded of our strength

99
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:37,970
而你赢得了他们的尊重 还有我的感激
and you have earned their respect and my gratitude.

100
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,097
谢谢
Thank you.

101
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,325
一切都井然有序
Nothing out of order

102
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:45,024
除了你那悸动的心
except your confused and distracted heart.

103
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,439
这和简・福斯特无关 父王
This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.

104
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,496
凡人的生命转瞬即逝 根本不值一提
Human lives are fleeting, they're nothing.

105
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,689
你还是珍惜你眼前的吧
You'd be better served by what lies in front of you.

106
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:56,113
我不是以众神之父的身份给你讲这个
I'm telling you this, not as the Allfather,

107
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,239
而是父亲
but as your father.

108
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,241
你已经准备好了
You are ready.

109
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,373
是时候登上王位了
The time has come for you to take the throne.

110
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,245
尽情庆祝你的胜利吧
Embrace and celebrate what you've won.

111
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,454
和你的勇士们一起
Join your warriors.

112
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,924
喝酒吃肉 享受狂欢的喜悦
Eat and drink, revel in their celebration.

113
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,386
至少也得装得很享受吧
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.

114
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,632
再来一杯!
Another!

115
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,861
以前你可是要狂欢好几周的
There was a time when you would celebrate for weeks.

116
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,290
我还记得庆祝哈罗金之战的时候
I remember you celebrated the Battle of Harokin

117
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,659
你兴奋得几乎想要立刻再去下一个国家战斗
so much that you nearly started the second.

118
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,328
第一次凯旋确实很有趣
Well, the first was so much fun.

119
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,841
陪我喝一杯
Take a drink with me.

120
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,011
今晚众神之父肯定不会再交给你任务了
Surely, the Allfather could have no further task for you tonight.

121
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,016
不 这是我自己的任务
No, this is one I set myself.

122
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,060
你每晚都消失 真让人想不注意都难
It does not go unnoticed that you disappear each night.

123
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,432
一共有九个国度
There are nine realms.

124
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,569
未来阿斯加德的国王不能只关注一个
The future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.

125
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,483
感谢你的英勇和你的忠告
I thank you for your sword

126
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,613
亲爱的席芙小姐
and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.

127
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,313
伦敦

128
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:19,092
嗨

129
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,092
嗨
Hi.

130
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,428
嗨
Hi.

131
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,920
给我讲讲你的故事?
So, what's the story with you?

132
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,723
为什么要有个故事? 没什么故事
Why does there have to be a story? There's no story.

133
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,058
我们约会的前十分钟你都把头埋在
You spent the first ten minutes of our date

134
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,027
只有三个选择的菜单里
hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it.

135
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,526
鸡肉 蔬菜和鱼 简
It's either chicken, vegetarian, or fish, Jane.

136
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,740
我猜肯定有个故事
I think there's a story

137
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,073
而且故事里应该有个男人
and I'm thinking the story involves a guy.

138
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,080
这很复杂
It's complicated.

139
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,410
他还在你身边?
Is he still around?

140
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,537
不 他...
No, he...

141
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,206
他离开了
went away.

142
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,745
我也经历过
I've been there.

143
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,959
分别很痛苦 对吧?
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?

144
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,464
我以前的女朋友
I was seeing a woman

145
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,422
她去纽约工作了
and she took a job in New York.

146
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,882
后来 爱情熬不过距离
Eventually, the distance killed it.

147
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,431
后来才知道她不停地和别的男人上床
And the fact that she kept sleeping with other dudes.

148
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,183
- 不是吧!  - 多了去了
- No!  - Oh, so many.

149
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,346
给我们来点红酒可以吗?
Hi. Could we get some wine, please?

150
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,559
当然 我也想喝
Sure, I'd love some.

151
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,273
理查德 这是黛西
Richard, this is Darcy.

152
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,776
你来这干嘛?
What are you doing here?

153
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,979
啊 欢迎
Oh. Hello.

154
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,824
我去实验室干活 又去了你妈家
So, I show up to work at the lab/your mom's house,

155
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,662
满心期待你穿着睡衣到处乱逛
fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas,

156
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,497
吃着冰激凌犯着某人的花痴...
eating ice cream and obsessing about...

157
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,822
你知道我指的是谁
you know who.

158
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,870
好吧
Ah.

159
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,414
但你没有 你穿着漂亮的衣服
But you're not. You're wearing lady clothes.

160
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,128
居然还洗了澡是吧? 挺好闻的
You even showered, didn't you? You smell good.

161
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,329
你说这些有什么意义吗?
Is there a point to all this?

162
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,456
最好有点意义
Because there really needs to be a point to all this.

163
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,674
好的
Right.

164
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,769
还记得那些你丢在一旁再没看过的仪器吧?
You know all that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore?

165
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,263
你可能想看看这个
You might want to start looking at it again.

166
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,429
这就是我们为什么大老远来这
This is the reason we came all the way out here.

167
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,633
坏了吧
It's malfunctioning.

168
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,635
我当时也这么说的
That's what I said.

169
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,678
我当时也这么做的
That's what I did.

170
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,647
我还以为你有更科学点的招呢
I thought you would do something a little more scientific.

171
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,432
- 没事的  - 是啊 这...
- I'm sure it's nothing.  - Yeah, it's...

172
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,605
看起来可不像没事
It doesn't look like nothing.

173
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,269
上边的读数好像是艾瑞克经常提到的
It kind of looks like the readings that Erik was rambling about.

174
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,362
艾瑞克是我们的朋友
Our friend Erik

175
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,482
有点脑残
kind of went banana balls.

176
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,649
他对这个没兴趣
He's not interested.

177
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,651
- 我也没兴趣  - 我挺有兴趣的
- I'm not interested.  - I'm interested.

178
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,323
你该走了
It's time for you to go now.

179
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,787
好吧
Okay.

180
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,242
简单明了 还挺可爱
Short but sweet.

181
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,961
她得看看病了
She needs help.

182
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,174
我准备点海鲈鱼
I think I'm going to have the sea bass.

183
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,210
海鲈鱼 海鲈鱼不错
Sea bass, yeah. Sea bass is good.

184
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:24,679
海鲈鱼 海鲈鱼 海鲈鱼
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.

185
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,310
海鲈鱼...
Sea bass...

186
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,678
海鲈鱼
Sea bass.

187
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,179
简?
Jane?

188
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,848
别再说"海鲈鱼"了
Maybe you should stop saying "sea bass"

189
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,896
你还是去找你朋友吧
and go after your friend.

190
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,018
和你在一起很有趣
This was so fun.

191
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,942
我自己坐着念"海鲈鱼"好了
I'll just stay here and say "sea bass" alone.

192
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:47,822
我恨你
And I hate you.

193
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,582
为啥? 我说他挺可爱的
What? I said he was cute.

194
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,784
闭上嘴开车
Just shut up and drive.

195
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,516
下个路口左转
You need to take the next left.

196
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,049
- 这是谁?  - 我带的实习生
- Who's he?  - He's my intern.

197
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,389
- 你还带实习生?  - 是啊
- You have an intern?  - Oh, yeah.

198
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,511
你好 福斯特博士
Hello, Dr. Foster.

199
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,477
跟你合作很荣幸
It's such a great honor to be working with you.

200
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,850
好了 我要给艾瑞克打电话
Right. I have to call Erik.

201
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,317
哦 向右转
Oh, take a right.

202
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,653
再向左转
And a left.

203
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,701
我已经完全掌握如何在伦敦开车了
I have totally mastered driving in London.

204
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,321
嗨 艾瑞克 还是我 你在哪?
Hi, Erik. It's me again. Where are you?

205
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,366
你说你在这有新发现 所以我就来了 然后你就消失了
I came here because you said you were onto something, and then you vanish.

206
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,913
我现在就在巨石阵现场
I'm here at Stonehenge

207
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,249
来看看今天发生了什么趣事
for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today.

208
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,163
警方已于今天早晨十一点后不久
The police were called to the scene

209
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,748
到达我所在的现场
shortly after 11 A.M. this morning

210
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,251
一位看似正常的游客步入这片区域之后
after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area.

211
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,051
突然脱掉衣服 赤身裸体
Then, decided to strip naked and effectively

212
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,300
并不时地用科学装置来吓唬其他游客
terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment.

213
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,310
同时宣称他正在拯救他们
Whilst shouting that he was trying to save them.

214
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,764
之后 此人被辨认出是天文物理学家艾瑞克・赛尔维格博士
The man, later identified as noted astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig

215
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,393
现已被警方带走问话
has been called in for questioning by police.

216
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,443
拜托 这很有意思
Come on, this is exciting.

217
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,732
看! 这个实习生也感兴趣
Look! The intern is excited.

218
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,067
我叫"伊安"
"Ian."

219
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,734
想要相位计吗?
Do you want the phase meter?

220
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,203
- 不想  - 把相位计带上
- No.  - Bring the phase meter.

221
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,159
就是那个看起来像个烤面包机的东西
The toaster-looking thing.

222
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,871
是 我知道相位计长啥样
Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.

223
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,000
我该怎么换掉这个铃声啊?
How do I change the ring-tone on this thing?

224
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,044
作为拥有三个学位的天体物理学家
An astrophysicist with three degrees

225
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,797
换个铃声应该小菜一碟吧
should be able to change her own ring-tone.

226
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,464
你为什么要给我打电话?
Why are you calling me?

227
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,800
我不想用喊的方式告诉你 实习生说走这边
I didn't want to shout. Intern says it's this way.

228
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,849
- 是"伊安" 我叫伊安  - 嘘 
- "Ian." My name is Ian.  - Shh.

229
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:51,033
我是不会为科学献身的
I am not getting stabbed in the name of science.

230
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,737
没事 我们是美国人
It's okay, we're Americans.

231
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,781
那样就能使他们喜欢我们吗?
Is that supposed to make them like us?

232
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,534
- 他们会走开的  - 嘘
- They'll make it go away.  - Shh.

233
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,462
哦 是小孩
Oh, they're kids.

234
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,914
你们是警察吗?
Are you the police?

235
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,259
不是 我们是科学家 错 只有我是科学家
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.

236
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,635
谢了
Thanks.

237
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,425
我们刚刚发现的
We just found it.

238
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,848
能带我们去看看吗?
Can you show us?

239
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,829
看起来不对啊
That doesn't seem right.

240
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,892
它去哪了?
Where'd it go?

241
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,444
太...
That's...

242
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,120
太难以置信了!
That's incredible!

243
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,256
什么情况?
What happened?

244
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,796
有时候他们会回来
Sometimes they come back.

245
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,510
有时候回不来
Sometimes they don't.

246
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,680
我也想扔点东西!
I want to throw something!

247
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,928
简 把你的鞋给我
Jane, give me your shoe.

248
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,728
我没见过有这种显示自从...
I haven't seen readings like this since...

249
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,351
自从...
Since...

250
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,477
上次在新墨西哥州?
New Mexico?

251
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,946
什么也别碰!
Don't touch anything!

252
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,288
把你的鞋给我
Give me your shoe.

253
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,127
哦
Oh.

254
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,811
你刚扔的是车钥匙吗?
Were those the car keys?

255
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,667
哇 啊!
Whoa. Ah!

256
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,170
哦!
Oh!

257
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,508
黛西!
Darcy!

258
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,723
哦!
Oh!

259
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,799
是以太粒子唤醒了我们
The Aether awakens us.

260
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,435
又到了"天体汇聚"的时刻
The Convergence returns.

261
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,823
你迟到了
You're late.

262
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,157
欢愉有时候比战争压力更大
Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle.

263
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,963
那其中之一肯定出了问题
Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.

264
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,665
也许是吧
Perhaps.

265
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,670
星星离这有多远?
How fare the stars?

266
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,502
还依旧闪烁
Still shining.

267
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,463
从这里 我能看到九个国度和十万亿的灵魂
From here, I can see nine realms and ten trillion souls.

268
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,092
能想起来我教你有关"天体汇聚"的事吗?
Do you recall what I taught you of the Convergence?

269
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,350
可以
Yes.

270
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,846
九星连珠
The alignment of the worlds.

271
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,730
又要到了 是吗?
It approaches, doesn't it?

272
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,852
从我的时钟开始走之后 整个宇宙再也看不到这个奇迹了 
The universe hasn't seen this marvel since before my watch began.

273
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:00,114
少数人能感觉到它 更极个别的人能看见它
Few can sense it. Even fewer can see it.

274
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,072
但它的影响却是具有危险性的
But while its effects can be dangerous,

275
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,746
真心好美
it is truly beautiful.

276
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,573
我什么也看不见
I see nothing.

277
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,204
也许这不是你所寻找的美
Or, perhaps, that is not the beauty you seek.

278
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,385
她怎么样了?
How is she?

279
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,466
你的人类姑娘 她很聪明 
She's quite clever, your mortal.

280
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,921
她现在还没弄明白
She doesn't know it yet,

281
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,425
但她也在研究"天体汇聚"
but she studies the Convergence as well.

282
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,808
甚至...
Even...

283
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,974
什么?
What?

284
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,229
我看不见她了
I can't see her.

285
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,233
简!
Jane!

286
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,106
你到底去哪了?
Where the hell were you?

287
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,936
你没叫警察吧
Tell me you didn't call the police.

288
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,063
那我该怎么做?
What was I supposed to do?

289
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,064
- 别叫警察  - 我都快吓死了
- Not call the police.  - I was freaking out.

290
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,357
你叫警察 他们就会叫联邦调查员
You call the cops, they call the Feds.

291
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,281
下一步你是知道的 神盾局的人会把这地方包围的
Next thing you know, we have S.H.I.E.L.D. crawling all over

292
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,028
- 这就是下一个"51区"  - 简
- "Area 51-ing" the place.  - Jane.

293
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,028
{\an8}51区 美国位于内华达州的秘密军事基地 外人禁止入内

294
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,196
我们有稳定的重力异常
We had a stable gravitation anomaly.

295
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,494
而且畅通无阻
We had unimpeded access.

296
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,122
我们仅有的竞争对手才十岁!
Our only competition was ten years old!

297
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,832
简! 你消失五个小时了
Jane! You were gone for five hours.

298
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,622
什么?
What?

299
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,135
好奇怪啊
That's weird.

300
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,115
重色轻友
Typical.

301
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,909
简
Jane.

302
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,327
抱歉 我只是想确定一下你是真的
Sorry. I just needed to make sure you were real.

303
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,996
今天好奇怪
It's been a very strange day.

304
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,664
我是 简 什么...
I am. Jane, what...

305
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,128
你死哪去了?
Where were you?

306
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,333
你到哪去了?
Where were you?

307
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,593
海姆达尔看不到你
Heimdall cannot see you.

308
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,504
我就在你离开我的地方
I was right here where you left me.

309
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,848
我一直等你 经常想你想得泪流满面
I was waiting, and then I was crying

310
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,511
然后我还四处去找你
and then I went out looking for you.

311
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,221
你说你会回来的
You said you were coming back.

312
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,728
我知道 我知道 但彩虹桥被毁坏了
I know. I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed.

313
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,434
九界都陷入了混乱
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.

314
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,728
战乱四起 盗贼横行
Wars were raging, marauders were pillaging.

315
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,893
我必须结束这些杀戮
I had to put an end to the slaughter.

316
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:48,314
借口编得还不赖
As excuses go, it's not terrible.

317
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,159
但我在电视上见你了 你在纽约!
But I saw you on TV. You were in New York!

318
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,862
简 我浴血奋战 都是为了保护你
Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world

319
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,661
但我错了
but I was wrong.

320
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,701
我是个傻瓜
I was a fool.

321
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:03,046
但我相信是命运又让你我相聚
But I believe that fate brought us together.

322
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,173
简 我不知道你在哪 发生了什么 但我知道...
Jane, I don't know where you were, or what happened, but I do know this...

323
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,003
什么?
What?

324
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,302
我知道...
I know...

325
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,633
你真的知道吗?
You do?

326
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,227
知道什么?
Do what?

327
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:18,971
什么?
What?

328
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,556
嘿!
Hey!

329
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,775
这是你干的吗?
Is this you?

330
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:29,981
我们正忙着呢
Uh, we're kind of in the middle of something here.

331
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,656
我十分肯定我们要进局子了	
Um, I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.

332
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,902
咱们待会再说
Hold that thought.

333
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,990
看看你 还是这么有型
Look at you, still all muscly and everything.

334
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,741
你们那怎么样了?
How's space?

335
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,870
还行吧
Space is fine.

336
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,247
打扰一下
Excuse me.

337
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,580
- 你是简・福斯特?  - 是的
- Are you Jane Foster?  - Yes.

338
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,582
你认识这个人吗?
Do you know this man?

339
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,251
他是我的实习生
He's my intern.

340
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,591
我实习生的实习生
My intern's intern.

341
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,796
你非法闯入私人领地了 你们都是
This is private property and you're trespassing, the lot of you.

342
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,094
你们得和我走一趟
You'll have to come with me.

343
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,889
简
Jane.

344
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,649
- 简  - 索尔?
- Jane.  - Thor?

345
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:05,976
你还好吧?
Are you all right?

346
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,357
发生了什么?
What just happened?

347
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,521
把手放在头上 退后
Place your hands on your heads. Step back.

348
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,647
这位女士生病了
This woman is unwell.

349
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,649
她很危险
She's dangerous.

350
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,993
我也是
So am I.

351
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,114
呼叫武装警力到现场
Requesting armed response officers to scene.

352
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,115
- 抱紧我  - 你要干什么?
- Hold on to me.  - What are you doing?

353
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,505
我勒个去
Holy shit.

354
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,034
我还想再来一次
We have to do that again.

355
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,490
嗨
Hi.

356
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,499
欢迎来到阿斯加德
Welcome to Asgard.

357
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,700
斯瓦塔尔海姆

358
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,527
看看我还剩下什么 阿拉冈
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

359
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,732
我都快想不起来世界一片黑暗的感觉了
I can barely remember a time before the light.

360
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,656
我们的幸存将会是您最大的财富
Our survival will be your legacy.

361
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,365
阿斯加德一族让我们受得罪 总有一天我会让他们加倍奉还
The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered.

362
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,700
我要找回以太
I will reclaim the Aether.

363
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,034
我将重建我们的世界
I will restore our world.

364
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,754
终结这个堕落的宇宙
And I will put an end to this poisoned universe.

365
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,130
这是什么?
What's that?

366
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,178
别动
Be still.

367
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,101
这不是地球上的物质 会是什么呢?
This is not of Earth. What is it?

368
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,565
我们还不知道
We do not know.

369
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,241
但由于体内有巨大的能量相互冲撞 她挺不了多久的
But she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her.

370
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,459
那不是量子发电机吗?
That's a quantum field generator, isn't it?

371
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,916
这是灵魂锻造机
It's a soul forge.

372
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:30,254
灵魂锻造机能把分子能量从一个地方转变到另一个地方吗?
Does a soul forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another?

373
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,170
可以
Yes.

374
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,043
那就是量子发电机
Quantum field generator.

375
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,093
你拿我说过的话当放屁吗?
My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely?

376
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,381
她生病着呢
She is ill.

377
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,759
她是个凡人
She is mortal.

378
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,472
疾病是她应有的体征
Illness is their defining trait.

379
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,303
我把她带到这来 因为我们能帮助她
I brought her here because we can help her.

380
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,227
她不属于阿斯加德
She does not belong here in Asgard

381
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,768
就如山羊逃不过被送上餐桌的命运
any more than a goat belongs at a banquet table.

382
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,602
他刚说啥...
Did he just...

383
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,270
你以为你是谁?
Who do you think you are?

384
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,820
我是奥丁 阿斯加德的国王
I am Odin, King of Asgard.

385
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,529
九界的保护者
Protector of the Nine Realms.

386
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,278
哦 呃 我...
Oh. Well, I'm...

387
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,289
我知道你是谁 简・福斯特
I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.

388
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,617
你给你爸提过我了?
You told your dad about me?

389
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,961
她体内有某种东西 父王
Something is within her, Father.

390
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,411
是我从没见过的物质
Something I have not seen before.

391
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,629
在她的世界也有治疗者
Her world has its healers.

392
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,667
他们叫"医生" 让他们去解决吧
They are called "doctors." Let them deal with it.

393
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,589
守卫 把她带回凡间
Guards, take her back to Midgard.

394
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,544
别动 我建议...
No, I would not...

395
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,389
最好别碰她
touch her.

396
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,804
简 你还好吗?
Jane, are you all right?

397
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,468
嗯
Yeah.

398
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,432
这不可能啊
It's impossible.

399
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,394
是她感染的物质... 在保护她
The infection... It's defending her.

400
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,316
不是
No.

401
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,486
它是在保护它自己
It's defending itself.

402
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,526
跟我来
Come with me.

403
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,451
有些物质在宇宙形成之前就存在了
There are relics that pre-date the universe itself.

404
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,493
她体内的物质应该就是其中之一
What lies within her appears to be one of them.

405
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,996
九界并非一直存在的
The Nine Realms are not eternal.

406
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,334
他们曾迎来黑暗后的黎明
They had a dawn

407
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,669
也必将经历辉煌后的黄昏
as they will have a dusk.

408
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,000
但在黎明之前
But before that dawn

409
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:05,516
黑暗势力 或者说黑暗精灵 一直对宇宙占有着绝对的统治权
the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.

410
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,764
"在无尽的黑暗中诞生的黑暗精灵
"Born of eternal night

411
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,729
会偷走宇宙的光明"
the Dark Elves come to steal away the light."

412
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,683
在我还是孩子的时候 母后就给我们讲过这些故事
I know these stories. Mother told them to us as children.

413
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:19,019
他们的首领玛勒基斯用黑暗制造了一个武器
Their leader Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness

414
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,688
被称为以太粒子
and it was called the Aether.

415
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,816
其它神物基本都是石头状的
While the other relics often appear as stones

416
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,491
只有以太是多变的液体
the Aether is fluid and everchanging.

417
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,247
它能将任何物体变为黑暗物质
It changes matter into dark matter.

418
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,959
它会寻找寄主 吸取寄主的生命力
It seeks out host bodies, drawing strength from their life-force.

419
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,172
玛勒基斯想要利用以太的能量
Malekith sought to use the Aether's power

420
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,085
让黑暗重新统治宇宙
to return the universe to one of darkness.

421
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,462
但是在经历了漫长的浴血奋战之后
But, after eternities of bloodshed

422
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,057
我的父王博尔最终获胜
my father Bor finally triumphed

423
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:51,721
迎来了数千年的和平时代
ushering in a peace that lasted thousands of years.

424
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:53,893
他是怎样获胜的?
What happened?

425
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,105
他把他们都消灭了
He killed them all.

426
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,477
你确定都消灭了吗?
Are you certain?

427
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,562
传言说以太也和他们一起被消灭了
The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them,

428
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,815
但如今却又出现了
and yet here it is.

429
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,405
黑暗精灵已经死了
The Dark Elves are dead.

430
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,613
你的书上有顺便提到怎么把它从我身上弄出来吗?
Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?

431
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,615
没有
No.

432
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,243
没有提到
It does not.

433
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,964
九界即将连成一线
The worlds are nearly aligned.

434
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,137
你将成为最后一个"献祭者"
You will be the last of the cursed.

435
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,932
我愿意牺牲自己
Let my life be sacrificed.

436
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,610
就如同我们的人民曾做出的牺牲
It is no less than our people did.

437
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,441
还有你所做的牺牲一样
Or you have done.

438
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,205
你将成为黑暗的使者
You will become darkness.

439
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:57,127
你会一直维持这个状态直到生命消耗殆尽
Cursed to this existence until it consumes you.

440
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:06,254
在那之前 我们的敌人都不是你的对手
Until then. no power our enemies possess can stop you.

441
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:16,143
我会彻底击垮他们的防御 助你重建黑暗的宇宙
I will tear down their defenses and ensure your return to a universe reborn.

442
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,372
让我们看管这些无赖真是大材小用了
Acting as caretakers to these scoundrels is beneath us.

443
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,706
哦 拜托! 如果他们在你身下
Oh, please! If they were beneath you,

444
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,835
我的大个子朋友 他们肯定活不了
my rotund friend, they'd all be dead.

445
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,517
- 保持队形!  - 快走!
- Keep in line!  - Move it!

446
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,694
奥丁总是给我送来新朋友啊
Odin continues to bring me new friends.

447
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,816
真是考虑周到
How thoughtful.

448
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,536
我送来的那些书 没有你喜欢的吗?
The books I sent, do they not interest you?

449
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,406
我就要这样度过余生吗? 光读书就行了?
Is that how I am to while away eternity? Reading?

450
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:20,618
我已经尽全力让你过得舒适了 洛基
I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.

451
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,666
是吗?
Have you?

452
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,547
奥丁也这么关心我吗?
Does Odin share your concern?

453
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,546
索尔呢?
Does Thor?

454
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:31,420
他们如此记挂我一定很累吧
It must be so inconvenient, them asking after me day and night.

455
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,550
你心里清楚 走到这一步完全是你咎由自取
You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.

456
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,434
我咎由自取?
My actions?

457
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,928
我只不过是将你们一直骗我的谎言变成了事实而已...
I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life...

458
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,680
我生来就该是国王
That I was born to be a king.

459
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,724
国王?
A king?

460
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,727
一个真正的国王敢于承认自己的错误
A true king admits his faults.

461
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,292
而你怎么解释自己在地球上大开杀戒的事实?
What of the lives you took on Earth?

462
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,104
和奥丁杀过的人数相比
A mere handful compared to the number

463
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,903
我的根本不值一提
that Odin has taken himself.

464
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,740
- 你父亲...  - 他不是我父亲!
- Your father...  - He's not my father!

465
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,832
那我也不是你的母亲吗?
Then am I not your mother?

466
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,005
不是
You're not.

467
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:14,765
你总是能看透别人 但就是看不透自己
You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.

468
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,112
你来找我的时候就知道我有麻烦了吗?
When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.

469
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,485
当海姆达尔看不到你时
Heimdall had lost sight of you.

470
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,282
就说明你已经不在地球上了
You were no longer on Earth.

471
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,741
怎么可能?
How is that possible?

472
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,988
我想你当时处于交界的位置
I believe you were and you weren't.

473
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,868
九界在宇宙之树中穿梭
The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil

474
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,413
环绕着人类的国度旋转 就像你们地球围着太阳转一样
orbiting Midgard much the way your planets orbit the sun.

475
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,791
每隔5000年 九界的旋转位置会连成一线
And every 5,000 years, the worlds align perfectly

476
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,011
我们把这个现象叫做"天体汇聚"
and we call this the Convergence.

477
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,805
在这段时间 九界的边界就会变得模糊
During this time, the borders between worlds become blurred.

478
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,266
你很有可能是找到了其中一个模糊界限
It's possible you found one of these points.

479
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,524
边界没有关闭已经很幸运了
We are lucky that it remained open.

480
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,938
一旦九界偏离了汇聚的直线
Once the worlds pass out of alignment

481
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,403
连接点就会消失
then the connection is lost.

482
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,540
我喜欢你解释的方式
I like the way you explain things.

483
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,210
我会怎样?
What's going to happen to me?

484
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,969
我会找到办法救你的 简
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.

485
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:38,302
- 可是你父王说...  - 我父王也不是无所不知的
- Your father said there was...  - My father doesn't know everything.

486
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,179
这话可别让他听见
Don't let him hear you say that.

487
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,926
简・福斯特...
Jane Foster...

488
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,344
这位是芙蕾嘉
Please meet Frigga,

489
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,268
阿斯加德的王后 也是我的母亲
Queen of Asgard, and my mother.

490
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,485
您好
Hi.

491
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,031
快走!
Move!

492
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,867
去地牢!
To the dungeons!

493
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,243
快点!
Come on!

494
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,481
你应该走左边的楼梯
You might want to take the stairs to the left.

495
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,873
是地牢
The prisons.

496
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,830
- 洛基...  - 去吧
- Loki... - Go.

497
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,835
我会保护她的
I will look after her.

498
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,856
怎么感觉他们很讨厌被囚禁一样!
It's as if they resent being imprisoned!

499
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,688
这些混蛋就是生在福中不知福
There's no pleasing some creatures.

500
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,849
回到你们自己的牢房里去 概不追责
Return to your cells, no further harm will come to you.

501
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,196
我保证
You have my word.

502
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,371
好极了 我收回对你的承诺
Very well, you do not have my word.

503
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,249
派一队人去武器库
Send a squadron to the weapons vault.

504
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,924
不惜一切 守住地牢
Defend it at all costs. Secure the dungeon.

505
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,679
- 奥丁  - 芙蕾嘉
- Odin. - Frigga.

506
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,547
去啊!
Go!

507
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,592
只是小事一桩
It's a skirmish.

508
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,967
不要担心
Nothing to fear.

509
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,470
你从来不擅长撒谎
You've never been a very good liar.

510
00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:13,553
带她去你的房间吧
Take her to your chambers.

511
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,431
骚乱平息后我去找你们
I'll come for you when it's safe.

512
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,140
你要小心
You take care.

513
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,262
经历了那么多大风大浪
Despite all I have survived,

514
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,779
我的王后还是这么担心我
my queen still worries over me.

515
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,106
没有我的担心
It's only because I worry over you

516
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,074
你可走不过那些大风大浪
that you have survived.

517
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,785
听清我的话
Listen to me now.

518
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,915
你需要完全照我的话做 不要有任何疑问
I need you to do everything I ask, no questions.

519
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,203
好的 夫人
Yes, ma'am.

520
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,887
阿斯加德的宫殿被摧毁了! 去保护国王!
The throne of Asgard is destroyed! To the king!

521
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:02,695
芙蕾嘉有危险
Frigga.

522
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,918
退下吧 怪物
Stand down, creature,

523
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,790
否则我就不客气了
and you may still survive this.

524
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,885
我可没那么好吓唬 女士
I have survived worse, woman.

525
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,714
你是谁?
Who are you?

526
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,303
我是玛勒基斯
I am Malekith.

527
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,094
我要取回我的东西
And I would have what is mine.

528
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,922
你拿走了一样东西 孩子
You have taken something, child.

529
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,007
还回来吧
Give it back.

530
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,485
女巫!
Witch!

531
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:21,691
以太在哪里?
Where is the Aether?

532
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,114
我永远不会告诉你
I'll never tell you.

533
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,328
这话我信
I believe you.

534
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,996
不!
No!

535
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,913
宇宙每5000年是一个循环
The universe rotates on a 5,000 year cycle

536
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,162
每个循环都会有一次九球连珠的现象
and once a cycle, all the worlds align.

537
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,753
假设... 假设这是我们的星球
Imagine... imagine that this is our world.

538
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,547
哦 谢谢 这是其它星球
Oh, thank you. And this is another world.

539
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,678
正常情况下 他们是错开的
Normally, they're separate.

540
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,630
但是在汇聚的时候
But during the Alignment,

541
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:17,181
九界彼此都是相连的
everything is connected, all nine realms.

542
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,594
九界之间可以互相穿梭
All nine realms are passing through each other

543
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,939
不管是重力 还是光 甚至是物质
and gravity, light, and even matter,

544
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,645
都可以从一个世界进入另一个世界
is crashing from one world to the other.

545
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,980
但是如果这一切发生在现在 后果将不堪设想
But if this happens to us now, the result will be cataclysmic.

546
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:35,487
我的重力峰值仪可以稳定天体汇聚的焦点
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence.

547
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,571
这样一来 汇聚的直线
This time, the Alignment

548
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,576
和其他星球就会和我们错开
and all the other worlds would just pass us by.

549
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,244
太棒了简直
It's beautiful.

550
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,918
非常简单 还有疑问吗?
It's simple. Any questions?

551
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,089
有
Yeah.

552
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,262
能把鞋还我吗?
Can I have my shoe back?

553
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,017
好好养伤吧 你需要力量去收回以太
Heal. You will need your strength to reclaim the Aether.

554
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:10,112
当你苏醒后 我们将彻底消灭他们
And when you wake, we will kill them all.

555
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:46,978
简・福斯特?
Jane Foster?

556
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,815
请跟我们来
You need to come with us.

557
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,157
我们现在还无法恢复宫殿的保护屏障
We are still unable to restore the palace shields.

558
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,696
我们的大炮探测不到他们
Our artillery cannot detect them.

559
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,615
甚至连海姆达尔都看不到他们
Even Heimdall cannot see them.

560
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:05,914
陛下 我们彻底失去防御力了
My king, we are all but defenseless.

561
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,963
你把她囚禁起来了?
She's your prisoner now?

562
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,675
都退下吧
Leave us.

563
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,849
我不想和你争辩
I do not wish to fight with you.

564
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,180
我也不想争
Nor I with you.

565
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,024
但我想去追查玛勒基斯
But I intend to pursue Malekith.

566
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,480
以太现在在我们手上
We possess the Aether.

567
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,360
玛勒基斯会来找我们的
Malekith will come to us.

568
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,604
没错 然后他会彻底摧毁我们
Yes, and he will destroy us.

569
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,733
你高估了那些怪物
You overestimate the power of these creatures.

570
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,201
不 我更重视我们人民的生命
No, I value our people's lives.

571
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,659
我会带简去黑暗世界 然后把敌人赶出阿斯加德
I'll take Jane to the Dark World, and draw the enemy away from Asgard.

572
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,698
当玛勒基斯将以太从简身上取出时
When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane,

573
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,701
它就会暴露在外面 脆弱不堪
it will be exposed and vulnerable.

574
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,666
我会一举歼灭他们
And I will destroy it and him.

575
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,540
一旦你失败了 这个武器就会
If you fail, you risk this weapon

576
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,384
落入敌人手中 这太危险
falling into the hands of our enemies.

577
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,880
坐以待毙的风险更大
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.

578
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,972
说不定他的飞船已经在我们头顶
His ship could be over our heads right now,

579
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,390
我们却还一无所知
we would never even know it.

580
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,800
即便他有胆入侵
If and when he comes

581
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:08,054
他的军队倒在一万阿斯加德精兵手下
his men will fall on 10,000 Asgardian blades.

582
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,477
又会有多少人死在他们手里呢?
And how many of our men shall fall on theirs?

583
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,566
我不在乎!
As many as are needed!

584
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,737
啊!
Ah!

585
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,073
我们要战斗!
We will fight!

586
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,120
直到最后一个人倒下
Till the last Asgardian breath.

587
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,957
直到最后一滴血流尽
Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.

588
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,209
那你和玛勒基斯又有什么区别?
Then how are you different from Malekith?

589
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,013
我的儿子 区别就在于我会赢
The difference, my son, is that I will win.

590
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:59,110
简不回我电话 艾瑞克也不回我电话
Jane isn't calling me back, Erik isn't calling me back,

591
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,154
连白痴的神盾局也不回我电话
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't calling me back.

592
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,192
- 神盾局是什么?  - 这是秘密
- What's S.H.I.E.L.D?  - It's a secret.

593
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,116
嘿 艾瑞克 我是黛西
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

594
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:08,036
索尔回来了 他把简带去了阿斯加德
Thor came back, he took Jane to Asgard,

595
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,826
我现在有点不知所措
and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.

596
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,828
本周还有以下新闻
Something else went missing this week

597
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,958
曾因卷入外星人入侵事件而闻名的
when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig

598
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,632
天体物理学博士艾瑞克・赛尔维格
notable for his involvement in the alien invasion of New York

599
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,091
赤身裸体穿过...
streaked nude across...

600
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:24,803
黛西 你得来看看这个
Darcy, you really need to look at this.

601
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,215
你朋友艾瑞克...
Your friend, Erik...

602
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,968
他姓啥来着?
What was his last name again?

603
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,306
接着朝古迹内的游客大声喊叫
And began shouting at visitors to the historic site.

604
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,520
随后他被警方关押看守
He was later taken into police custody

605
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,440
以便于进行精神测评
for psychiatric evaluation.

606
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,651
目前警方仍拒绝确认...
Police are still refusing to confirm...

607
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,205
你没来参加奥丁的军事会议
You were not at Odin's war council.

608
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,670
你父亲已下令关闭彩虹桥
The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders.

609
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,245
无人能进
No one is to come

610
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,543
也无人能出
or to go.

611
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,344
我们面对的敌人连我也无法看见
We face an enemy that is invisible even to me.

612
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:06,223
这样的门卫还有什么用?
What use is a guardian such as that?

613
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,427
玛勒基斯不会罢休 这你也明白
Malekith will return, you know this.

614
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,018
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

615
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,235
我不能违逆国王的旨意 即便是为了你
I cannot overrule my king's wishes. Not even for you.

616
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:19,979
我不是那个意思
I'm not asking you to.

617
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,531
九界需要一个强大 无人敢挡的众神之父
The realms need their Allfather strong and unchallenged

618
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,238
无论他是否真是如此
whether he is or not.

619
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,193
但他不再明智了 海姆达尔
But he is blinded, Heimdall

620
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:29,028
被仇恨与悲伤蒙蔽
by hatred and by grief.

621
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,780
我们都一样
As are we all.

622
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,073
我还足够清醒
I see clearly enough.

623
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,701
风险太大了
The risks are too great.

624
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,711
往后的每一件事都毫无定数
Everything we do from here on is a risk.

625
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,588
我们别无选择
There is no other way.

626
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,761
你需要我做什么?
What do you require of me?

627
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,428
我请求你违抗国王的命令
What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order.

628
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:52,765
成功了会被流放 失败则死路一条
Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death.

629
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:59,735
玛勒基斯知道以太就在这里 他能感受到它的力量
Malekith knew the Aether was here. He can sense its power.

630
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,441
我们再不行动 他就会卷土重来
If we do nothing, he will come for it again

631
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:06,734
但这一次 阿斯加德只会覆灭
but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.

632
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,736
我们必须把简转移出去
We must move Jane off-world.

633
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,576
彩虹桥已经关闭
The Bifrost has been shut down

634
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,415
宇宙魔方被锁在宝库内
and the Tesseract locked away in the vault.

635
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:17,785
离开阿斯加德还有途径 只是鲜为人知
There are other paths off Asgard. Ways known only to a few.

636
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,709
确切的说 只有一个人
One, actually.

637
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,542
不行
No.

638
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,257
索尔 过了这么久
Thor. After all this time

639
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,932
你总算是来看我了
and now you come to visit me.

640
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,434
为什么?
Why?

641
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,813
是来幸灾乐祸? 还是讥讽嘲弄?
Have you come to gloat? To mock?

642
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,561
洛基 够了
Loki, enough.

643
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,821
别再用幻象骗我
No more illusions.

644
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,081
现在你看见我了 哥哥
Now you see me, brother.

645
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,507
她死前痛苦吗?
Did she suffer?

646
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,968
我不是来与你分享痛苦的
I did not come here to share our grief.

647
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:10,180
我想为你提供一个弥补的机会
Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.

648
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,807
继续
Go on.

649
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,718
我知道你和我一样渴望复仇
I know you seek vengeance as much as I do.

650
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,689
你帮我逃出阿斯加德 我就给你机会
You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you.

651
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,349
复仇的机会
Vengeance

652
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,938
然后 再回到这里
and afterward, this cell.

653
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:34,492
你一定是走投无路了 才会来找我帮忙
You must be truly desperate to come to me for help.

654
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,823
你凭什么相信我?
What makes you think you can trust me?

655
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,246
我不信
I don't.

656
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,044
母亲相信
Mother did.

657
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,833
但在过去那么多次兵戎相见中
But you should know that when we fought each other in the past,

658
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,209
我确实隐隐地希望着
I did so with a glimmer of hope

659
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,087
我的弟弟仍然和曾经一样
that my brother was still in there somewhere.

660
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,182
这种希望再不会有了
That hope no longer exists to protect you.

661
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,387
你若背叛我 我就杀了你
You betray me, and I will kill you.

662
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,399
唔
Hmm.

663
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:05,684
我们什么时候开始?
When do we start?

664
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,103
他一定会背叛你
He will betray you.

665
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,731
让他试试看
He will try.

666
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,696
这可不像你啊 哥哥
This is so unlike you, brother.

667
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,864
偷偷摸摸的
So clandestine.

668
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,230
你确定不打算直接砸开一条路?
Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?

669
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,869
你再烦 我就真的砸了
If you keep speaking, I just might.

670
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,837
行 都听你的
Fine. As you wish.

671
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,377
当我不存在
I'm not even here.

672
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,209
这样是不是好点了?
Is this better?

673
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,879
至少比刚才好多了
It's better company at least.

674
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:35,928
其实还可以更不显眼些
Still, we could be less conspicuous.

675
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,853
唔 哥哥 你真是迷人
Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.

676
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,396
就算这样我也能轻松干掉你
It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.

677
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,732
很好 或者你更喜欢我变成你的新朋友
Very well. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions

678
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,942
你似乎很喜欢他们
given that you seem to like them so much.

679
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:52,606
哦 这样好多了
Oh, this is much better.

680
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,608
噢
Ooh.

681
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:56,570
制服有些太紧了
The costume is a bit much. So tight.

682
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,033
但这种自信的感觉...
But the confidence...

683
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,619
我能感到正义的力量扑面而来
I can feel the righteousness surging.

684
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,251
嘿 你想来场关于真相的激动人心的讨论吗?
Hey, do you want to have a rousing discussion about truth?

685
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:04,994
或者荣耀? 还是爱国主义?
Honor? Patriotism?

686
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:05,996
上帝保佑美...
God bless Amer...

687
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,050
干嘛?
What?

688
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,924
你至少给我一把武器吧
You could at least furnish me with a weapon.

689
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,967
我的匕首 或者随便什么
My dagger, something.

690
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,806
这才对
At last.

691
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,525
总算有点常识
A little common sense.

692
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,275
你不是喜欢恶作剧吗
And I thought you liked tricks.

693
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:40,827
然后呢? 你心爱的凡人正被英灵战士重重守卫
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of Einherjar

694
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,823
你接近半米都会被发现
who will see you coming from miles away.

695
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,542
去救她的不能是我
I won't be the one who comes for her.

696
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,335
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

697
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,961
这是怎么...
What the...

698
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,215
很好 那就走吧
Good. Let's go.

699
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:04,642
你是...
You're...

700
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,847
我是洛基 你或许听说过我
I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.

701
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,475
这一下是为了纽约
That was for New York.

702
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:10,853
我喜欢她
I like her.

703
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,650
众神之父呢?
And what of the Allfather?

704
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:17,034
向他通告一切叛国罪行是我誓约的责任
It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne.

705
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,780
你紧急召唤我来
You called me here on an urgent matter.

706
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,822
出了什么事?
What is it?

707
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,657
有人叛国 大人
Treason, my lord.

708
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,001
是谁?
Whose?

709
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,748
我
Mine.

710
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,079
陛下!
My king!

711
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,082
那个凡人被带走了
The mortal has been taken.

712
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,044
阻止索尔
Stop Thor.

713
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,173
不惜任何手段
By any means necessary.

714
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,386
他们在那儿! 抓住他们
There they are! Take them.

715
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,552
听我命令
On my command.

716
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,772
我拖住他们 你带她走
I'll hold them off. Take her.

717
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,812
谢谢
Thank you.

718
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,853
敢背叛他 我就杀了你
Betray him, and I'll kill you.

719
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,617
我也很高兴见到你 席芙
It's good to see you, too, Sif.

720
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:09,544
即便你能得到洛基的帮助 解救这位凡人
Assuming you can get Loki's help and you can free this mortal

721
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,245
又有什么用呢?
what good would it do?

722
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:14,206
我们一走出宫殿就死定了
We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.

723
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,427
这就是为什么我们不能用走的
That, my friend, is why we won't be leaving by foot.

724
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,382
我会尽量为你争取时间
I will give you as much time as I can.

725
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,226
谢谢你 我的朋友
Thank you, my friend.

726
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:32,563
敢背叛他 哪怕只是想想...
If you even think about betraying him...

727
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,393
你就会杀了我?
You'll kill me?

728
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,396
显然 你得排队才行
Evidently, there will be a line.

729
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:53,797
我以为你说过你会开这东西
I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.

730
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:55,831
我说的是 "能有多难?"
I said, "How hard could it be?"

731
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:00,128
他们在船上!
They're on the ship!

732
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,259
快上船!
Get to the ship!

733
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,635
无论你在干什么 我建议你加快速度 哥哥
Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.

734
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:11,014
闭嘴 洛基
Shut up, Loki.

735
01:04:12,126 --> 01:04:13,390
你肯定是漏了什么
You must have missed something.

736
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,185
我没有 每个按钮我都按过了
No, I didn't. I'm pressing every button on this thing.

737
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,779
不 别砸它 轻轻地按就好
No, don't hit it. Just press it gently.

738
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,739
我正在轻轻按呢 这不管用!
I'm pressing it gently, it's not working!

739
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:23,860
哈哈!
Ha, ha!

740
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,082
抓住他! 抓住他!
Get him! Get him!

741
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:00,147
- 你漏了根柱子没撞到  - 闭嘴!
- I think you missed a column. - Shut up!

742
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:08,737
听着 你为什么不让我开呢?
Look, why don't you let me take over?

743
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:09,990
我显然比你技术好多了
I'm clearly the better pilot.

744
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,204
真的? 我们两人中
Is that right? Well, out of the two of us,

745
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,827
究竟是谁真的会飞啊?
which one can actually fly?

746
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,004
天啊 她死了吗?
Oh, dear. Is she dead?

747
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,006
简
Jane.

748
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:28,800
我没事
I'm okay.

749
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,932
啊!
Ah!

750
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,275
不准说话
Not a word.

751
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,771
他们追上来了
Now they're following us.

752
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,277
他们朝我们开火了
Now they're firing at us.

753
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,861
多谢你的解说 洛基
Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki,

754
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,205
我一点儿也不觉得干扰!
it's not at all distracting!

755
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:57,370
真棒 你刚刚干掉了你爷爷
Well done. You just decapitated your grandfather.

756
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,141
这可真赞
You know, this is wonderful.

757
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:12,556
这主意真是太妙了
This is a tremendous idea.

758
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,814
让我们把全宇宙最大最显眼的船偷来
Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe

759
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,306
再开着它逃跑
and escape in that.

760
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,557
绕着城市飞
Flying around the city,

761
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,936
看到什么撞什么 好让所有人都看见
smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us.

762
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,780
太聪明了 索尔! 这真是太聪明了!
It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!

763
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,994
看来地牢里的日子
I see your time in the dungeons

764
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,589
一点也没折损你的优雅 洛基
has made you no less graceful, Loki.

765
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,761
你骗了我
You lied to me.

766
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,464
真是令人惊讶
I'm impressed.

767
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:52,007
你开心就好
I'm glad you're pleased.

768
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,091
现在就按照你承诺的
Now, do as you promised.

769
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,935
带我们去你的秘密通道
And take us to your secret pathway.

770
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,706
- 范达尔  - 遵命
- Fandral.  - Right.

771
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:24,415
为阿斯加德效命
For Asgard.

772
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,138
对事不对人 兄弟们
Nothing personal, boys.

773
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:47,896
洛基...
Loki...

774
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:51,316
如果简单的话 别人就都会了
If it were easy, everyone would do it.

775
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,319
- 你疯了吗?  - 可能吧
- Are you mad?  - Possibly.

776
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,511
到啦!
Ta-da!

777
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,395
我们必须马上反击
We must strike now.

778
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,431
不
No.

779
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:28,689
阿斯加德毫无意义
Asgard is meaningless.

780
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,823
以太已经找到了回家的路
The Aether has found its way home.

781
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:54,171
我可以怎么利用那些流经血脉的能量?
What I could do with the power that flows through those veins?

782
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,846
它会将你消耗掉
It would consume you.

783
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,393
她熬过来了
She's holding up all right.

784
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:01,345
暂时而已
For now.

785
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,437
她强大到你无法置信
She's strong in ways you'd never even know.

786
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,974
告别吧
Say goodbye.

787
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,773
不是今天
Not this day.

788
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:10,693
今天 明天 一百年 全都一样
This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing.

789
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,486
她是凡人
It's a heartbeat.

790
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,902
你永远无法预知
You'll never be ready.

791
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,903
你珍视的挚爱女人
The only woman whose love you've prized

792
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,780
终有一天会被夺走
will be snatched from you.

793
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,078
那样你就满意了吗?
And will that satisfy you?

794
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,824
满足也不是我的天性
Satisfaction is not in my nature.

795
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,044
放弃也不是我的天性
Surrender is not in mine.

796
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,412
- 奥丁之子...  - 不  
- The son of Odin...  - No.

797
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,461
不仅仅是奥丁的
Not just of Odin.

798
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,926
你以为你独享母亲的爱吗?
You think you alone were loved of Mother?

799
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,087
你习得了她的障眼法 但我得到了她的信任
You had her tricks, but I had her trust.

800
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:35,509
信任?
Trust?

801
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,924
这是她的遗言吗?
Was that her last expression?

802
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:40,768
你让她死的时候 她还信吗?
Trust? When you let her die?

803
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,679
- 你在监狱时 谁帮你的?  - 谁害我蹲监狱的?
- What help were you in your cell?  - Who put me there?

804
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,102
谁害的?
Who put me there?

805
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:46,224
你很清楚!
You know damn well!

806
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,685
你很清楚是谁!
You know damn well who!

807
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,615
她不会想我们自相残杀的
She wouldn't want us to fight.

808
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,285
自相残杀她也未必会惊讶
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.

809
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:08,496
我也想信任你
I wish I could trust you.

810
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,978
那就信任我的愤怒吧
Trust my rage.

811
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,523
赛尔维格先生 请你签收你父亲的随身物品
You'll have to sign for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.

812
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,361
什么?
What?

813
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:37,899
哦 对
Oh, yeah.

814
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,904
我的父亲是艾瑞克・赛尔维格博士
My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.

815
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:45,073
一个棕色的男士皮钱包
One man's leather wallet, brown.

816
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,543
一个钥匙圈 三把钥匙
One key ring, three keys.

817
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,583
各式各样的...
Prescription medicine...

818
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,581
处方药
Various.

819
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,002
- 还有...  - 艾瑞克
- And...  - Erik.

820
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,087
- 这些玩意  - 对
- These.  - Yeah.

821
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,305
那些玩意
Those.

822
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,095
谢天谢地
Thank goodness.

823
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,977
艾瑞克
Erik.

824
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,889
你好?
Yes?

825
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,687
我是黛西
It's, uh, Darcy.

826
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:10,899
黛西
Darcy.

827
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,900
见到你太好了
So good to see you.

828
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,068
我也想念你
Oh, I missed you, too.

829
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:17,689
你怎么找到我的?
How did you find me?

830
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:18,942
在电视上看到你裸奔了
You were naked on TV.

831
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,446
好吧 该走了 还有很多事要做
Okay, time to go, lots to do.

832
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,532
这样有点奇怪了
Getting weird now.

833
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,078
不该留下我来处理这样的破事
I should not be left in charge of stuff like this.

834
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:34,122
应该给我多点薪水 我大姨妈来了都没给我发薪
I don't get paid enough. I don't get paid, period.

835
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,127
顺便提下 我是伊安 是黛西的实习生
I'm Ian by the way, uh, Darcy's intern.

836
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,466
我也没薪水领
Yeah, I don't get paid either.

837
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:41,806
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

838
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,807
我脑袋中有个神
I've had a god in my brain.

839
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,602
我就不介绍它了
I don't recommend it.

840
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,597
赛尔维格博士 你的装置一直在哔哔响
Dr. Selvig, sir, your gear is beeping at me.

841
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:52,976
它经常这样 比我计算起来要快
It's happening. It's sooner than I calculated.

842
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,769
等等 发生什么事?
Wait. What's happening?

843
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,737
鸟吗?
Birds?

844
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:01,316
就因为鸟在飞吗?
Birds are happening?

845
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,570
是八哥 这是哀嚎
They're starlings. It's called a murmuration.

846
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,909
小时候我父亲经常带我去观鸟
My dad, he used to take me bird watching as a kid.

847
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,574
- 呆子  - 看!
- Nerd.  - Look!

848
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,334
它们去了哪儿?
Where did they go?

849
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,432
他妈的搞什么鬼?
What the hell was that?

850
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,602
为什么你还笑得出来?
Why are you smiling?

851
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,056
现在知道这个世界
There's nothing more reassuring

852
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:36,852
比你们更疯狂 我放心多了
than realizing that the world is crazier than you are.

853
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,732
带我去简的实验室
Take me to Jane's lab.

854
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,669
简 你醒了
Jane.

855
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:01,636
玛勒基斯
Malekith.

856
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,823
好的 你准备好了吗?
All right. Are you ready?

857
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,237
我准备好了
I am.

858
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:43,001
你这计划会让我们赔上性命
You know, this plan of yours is going to get us killed.

859
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:44,879
对 有可能
Yes, possibly.

860
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,868
你还不信任我吧 哥哥?
You still don't trust me, brother?

861
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:52,641
你会信任我吗?
Would you?

862
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:02,779
不 我不会
No, I wouldn't.

863
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,036
索尔!
Thor!

864
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,455
不要!
No!

865
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:23,291
你真的觉得我在乎芙蕾嘉吗?
You really think I cared about Frigga?

866
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,010
在乎你们任何一个人?
About any of you?

867
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,006
我想要一直是
All I ever wanted

868
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:31,555
让你和奥丁
was you and Odin

869
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:32,768
死在我脚下!
dead at my feet!

870
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:46,399
玛勒基斯!
Malekith!

871
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,486
我是冰巨人后裔洛基
I am Loki of Jotunheim,

872
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,576
给你带来了礼物
and I bring you a gift.

873
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,449
我要的回报只有一个...
I ask only one thing in return...

874
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,326
一个观赏阿斯加德
a good seat from which

875
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,327
燃为灰烬的好位子
to watch Asgard burn.

876
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,831
他是阿斯加德的敌人
He is an enemy of Asgard.

877
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,585
是他们地牢里的囚犯
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.

878
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:20,933
看着我
Look at me.

879
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:20,451
洛基! 动手!
Loki! Now!

880
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:42,082
啊!
Ah!

881
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:37,296
啊!
Ah!

882
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:36,906
- 啊!  - 不要!
- Ah!  - No!

883
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:48,284
地狱见 怪物
See you in hell, monster.

884
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,604
不 不 不 不
No. No, no, no.

885
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,266
你这个笨蛋 不听我的
Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.

886
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:14,268
我知道...
I know...

887
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,562
我是个笨蛋 是个笨蛋
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.

888
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:18,813
坚持住 好吗?
Stay with me, okay?

889
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:19,986
对不起
I'm sorry.

890
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:24,245
- 对不起 对不起  - 嘘...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  - Shh...

891
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:25,658
没事的
It's okay.

892
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:30,785
没事的
It's all right.

893
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:34,413
我会告诉父王你今天做得很好
I'll tell Father what you did here today.

894
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,423
我不是为了他
I didn't do it for him.

895
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:51,347
不!
No!

896
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,198
他将会发动战争
He's going to unleash it.

897
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:52,496
不仅是对付阿斯加德或其它星球 玛勒基斯会毁掉一切
Not just on Asgard, or on a star. Malekith is going to destroy everything.

898
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:53,742
用什么方式?
How?

899
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:55,999
简 用什么方式?
Jane, how?

900
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,340
我看到他在地球上 为什么他会去地球?
I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?

901
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,292
天体汇聚
The Convergence.

902
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:02,708
天啊
Oh, God.

903
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:05,149
如果我不发现以太 所有这些事情就不会发生了
None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.

904
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:07,673
那样玛勒基斯会更快地
Then Malekith would've only possessed it

905
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:09,549
霸占太空
that much sooner.

906
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,019
我当时只是为了找到你
I only found it because I was looking for you.

907
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:13,888
简...
Jane...

908
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:17,232
现在我们被困在这里了
Now we're trapped here.

909
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:24,989
不是我的
It's not me.

910
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,492
喂?
Hello?

911
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,826
嗨 简 我是理查德
Hi, Jane, it's Richard.

912
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:30,738
理查德? 你在哪儿?
Richard? Where are you?

913
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,080
我还在办公室
I'm still at the office.

914
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,240
今天真是忙疯了
It's been a crazy day here today.

915
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,164
- 天啊 太好了  - 是吗?
- Oh, my God, this is amazing.  - Is it?

916
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:37,577
除了没有点东西吃
I quite enjoyed our lunch

917
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:39,745
我挺享受我们的午餐的
despite never actually ordering anything.

918
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,247
怎么这里会有信号?
How am I getting service here?

919
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:43,376
你不方便吗? 需要稍后再打给你吗?
Is this a bad time? Do you want me to try you later?

920
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,674
不 不 无论怎样 拜托不要挂电话
No, no, no. Please, whatever you do, do not hang up the phone.

921
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:48,754
那好吧
Okay, then.

922
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:51,215
不知道你是否想再一起出来
I was just wondering if you want to try again.

923
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,758
或者下次吃个晚饭
Uh, maybe dinner next time.

924
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:54,386
好 好 好 
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

925
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,764
- 不要挂电话 好吗?  - 好的
- Just stay on the phone, okay?  - Yeah, I will.

926
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,857
天啊
Oh, my God.

927
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:03,895
我打扰到你了吗?
Am I interrupting something?

928
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:05,614
不 不 不 没事
No, no, no. Nothing at all.

929
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:06,856
说吧
Come on.

930
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:07,949
我听不到你说话 你在隧道里面吗?
I'm losing you there. Are you in a tunnel?

931
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:09,609
我们要去哪儿?
Where are we going?

932
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:10,611
还在吗?
Hello?

933
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:12,579
为什么这里有那么多鞋子?
Why are there so many shoes in here?

934
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:15,999
还是发短信给她吧
I'll just text her.

935
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:29,467
谁是理查德?
So, who's Richard?

936
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,098
真的要问吗? 
Really?

937
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,973
- 简!  - 嘿
- Jane!  - Hey.

938
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,808
你不能就那样跑掉的
You can't just leave like that.

939
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:44,106
整个世界都疯掉了
The whole world is going crazy.

940
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:46,112
我们发现的现象现在到处都是
All the stuff we saw is spreading.

941
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:49,449
- 你去参加化妆舞会了吗?  - 艾瑞克?
- Did you go to a party?  - Erik?

942
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:53,241
简! 太好了
Jane! How wonderful.

943
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:55,159
噢!
Oh!

944
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,406
- 你去了阿斯加德  - 你的裤子呢?
- You've been to Asgard.  - Where are your pants?

945
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:59,159
呃... 他说这样有助于思考
Oh, he, uh... He says it helps him think.

946
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:00,952
我需要你研究出来的所有资料
Okay, well, I'm going to need everything you got on this.

947
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:03,672
你一直在做的重量异常研究 所有东西
All the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies, everything.

948
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:05,039
好的
Okay.

949
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,134
你好吗 艾瑞克?
Are you well, Erik?

950
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,086
你弟弟没来吧?
Your brother's not coming, is he?

951
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:11,504
洛基死了
Loki is dead.

952
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:12,597
谢天谢地!
Oh, thank God!

953
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,976
我是说... 节哀顺变
I... I meant, I'm so sorry.

954
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,640
谢谢
Thank you.

955
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:43,120
请原谅我 大人
Forgive me, my liege.

956
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,457
我从黑暗世界回来了 有消息禀告
I've returned from the Dark World with news.

957
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,009
索尔呢?
Thor?

958
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:55,095
那没有索尔或是武器的踪迹 不过...
There was no sign of Thor, or the weapon, but...

959
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:58,142
什么?
What?

960
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,723
我们发现了一具尸体
We found a body.

961
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,562
是洛基
Loki.

962
01:25:12,586 --> 01:25:14,650
玛勒基斯打算在九界连为一线之时
Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot

963
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,574
启动以太元素
where all the nine worlds are connecting.

964
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:19,238
增强武器的冲击力
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

965
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:20,661
一旦发射到其它世界
Reach additional world,

966
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,876
能量就会成指数倍增加
the power will increase exponentially.

967
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,039
其毁灭效果是宇宙级的
The effect would be universal.

968
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:27,872
但九星连珠时间很短
But the Alignment is only temporary.

969
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:30,922
他必须在准确的时间到达准确的地点
He must be in exactly the right place at the right time.

970
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,716
我们怎么知道是哪里?
Well, how do we know where that is?

971
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,343
我们根据先人的指引
We follow the directions.

972
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:37,758
这种情况
This has happened before

973
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:41,228
在几千年前发生过 古人们都见证过
thousands of years ago, and the ancients were there to see it.

974
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:43,264
所有伟大的建筑
All the great constructions,

975
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:46,891
无论是玛雅人 中国人 还是埃及人造的
the Mayans, the Chinese, the Egyptians.

976
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:50,394
都利用了天体汇聚的重力效应
They made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence.

977
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,563
而且还留下了地图
And they left us a map.

978
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:53,986
巨石阵
Stonehenge,

979
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:56,567
斯诺登峰
Snowdon,

980
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:57,818
大奥玛
the Great Orme.

981
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,696
这些坐标把我们指引到...
These are all coordinates taking us...

982
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:02,074
这里
Here.

983
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,118
格林尼治?
Greenwich?

984
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:08,747
九界之间的阻碍将几乎不存在
The walls between worlds will be almost non-existent.

985
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:10,289
将会产生极大的物理效应
Physics is going to go ballistic.

986
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:12,133
重力不停地增加衰减
Increases and decreases in gravity,

987
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:13,793
出现空间挤压现象
spatial extrusions.

988
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:16,422
现实世界被彻底摧毁
The very fabric of reality is going to be torn apart.

989
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,928
我去穿上裤子
I better get my pants.

990
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:24,855
认真点! 这很重要
Focus! This is important.

991
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,481
我们必须在驻地周围布置好它们
We have to hammer them in all around the site

992
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,896
这样简和艾瑞克就能从塔上启动了
and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.

993
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,694
这是用胶带绑起来的
They're taped together.

994
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:33,192
你到底知不知道这些东西是干嘛用的?
Do you even know what these things do?

995
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:35,190
呃... 不知道
Uh... no.

996
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:36,525
我也不知道
Neither do I.

997
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:42,622
嘘!
Shh!

998
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,327
- 快点 快点 快点!  - 知道了
- Come on, come on, come on!  - Right.

999
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:01,133
我...
Holy...

1000
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,259
靠
shit.

1001
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:15,772
啊!
Ah!

1002
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:23,094
你没必要大老远跑来 阿斯加德人
You needn't have come so far, Asgardian.

1003
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,434
反正你也快死了
Death would've come to you soon enough.

1004
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,134
那也不是被你杀死
Not by your hand.

1005
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,970
你的世界从来就没有存在的意义
Your universe was never meant to be.

1006
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:33,140
你的世界和你的家人
Your world and your family

1007
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,269
将会被消灭!
will be extinguished!

1008
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,901
我们快没时间了
We're running out of time.

1009
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:41,440
- 快好了  - 你确定这样有用吗?
- Almost there.  - Are you sure this is going to work?

1010
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:44,035
这些设备是用来监测异常现象的 而不是引起现象
These devices were made to detect anomalies, not cause them.

1011
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,162
快点
Oh, come on.

1012
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,537
快点 黛西
Come on, Darcy.

1013
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,932
要知道 既然拥有了强大的能量
You know, with all that power,

1014
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:07,551
你应该再加把劲儿
I thought you'd hit harder.

1015
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,043
搞定
Done.

1016
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:43,678
七分钟后 天体汇聚效应将达到最大值
The Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes.

1017
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,996
那意味着我们得让玛勒基斯至少忙活八分钟
That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight.

1018
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,347
好的 你最好抱紧个什么东西
Okay, you might want to hold on to something.

1019
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,478
真牛!
That is awesome!

1020
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:03,063
你怎么做到的?
How did you do that?

1021
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:04,440
呃 重力场可以
Well, the gravitational fields

1022
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:06,817
和世界之间的弱分布点相互作用 产生...
interact with the weak spots between worlds, creating...

1023
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:08,240
快搞定那个拿剑的家伙!
Ooh, get the guy with the sword!

1024
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:13,533
- 完了  - 快走
- Oops.  - Let's go.

1025
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:15,080
呃...
Um...

1026
01:30:15,264 --> 01:30:17,328
刚才到底什么情况?
What the hell just happened?

1027
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:18,956
快跑!
Move!

1028
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:38,062
你们都在这干什么呢?
What are you all doing?

1029
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:39,856
得赶快离开这 快点!
You need to get out of here, now!

1030
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:41,523
你开玩笑的 对吗?
You're joking, right?

1031
01:30:41,645 --> 01:30:42,686
索尔在外面呢
That's Thor out there.

1032
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,815
他正在挥舞锤子打得风生水起!
He's waving his hammer around and everything!

1033
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:45,125
啊!
Ah!

1034
01:32:02,987 --> 01:32:04,852
确认飞船是否属于敌方
Confirming ship is hostile.

1035
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,812
已确认为敌舰
Confirmed, ship is hostile.

1036
01:32:06,813 --> 01:32:08,313
授权发射
You have permission to engage.

1037
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:09,606
收到
Roger.

1038
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:10,733
导弹锁定
Missiles locked.

1039
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:13,320
发射
Missiles away.

1040
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:16,030
导弹偏离目标
Missiles off target.

1041
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:18,824
重复 偏离目标 战机失去控制
I repeat, target missed. I'm losing control.

1042
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:21,624
求救! 求救! 完全失去控制
Mayday! Mayday! Lost positive control.

1043
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:24,830
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

1044
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:26,333
信号连接不上了
My signal's not connecting.

1045
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:29,710
简!
Jane!

1046
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:30,803
快走
Come on.

1047
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,385
你还好吧?
Are you all right?

1048
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:15,548
你救了我
You saved my life.

1049
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:20,260
是的
Yeah.

1050
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,558
我想是的
I guess I did.

1051
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:30,355
嗯
Mmm.

1052
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:31,731
黛西?
Darcy?

1053
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:33,148
简!
Jane!

1054
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:35,493
- 伊安!  - 赛尔维格!
- Ian!  - Selvig!

1055
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:37,199
快看!
Mew mew!

1056
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:42,701
请小心站台缝隙
Mind the gap.

1057
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:45,993
我怎么去格林尼治?
How do I get to Greenwich?

1058
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:49,040
上车 三站就到
Take this train. Three stops.

1059
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:53,629
请小心站台缝隙
Mind the gap.

1060
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:57,515
抱歉 对不起
Sorry. Sorry.

1061
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:36,676
- 我们没时间了  - 简
- We're out of time.  - Jane.

1062
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:38,923
简!
Jane!

1063
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:06,288
索尔!
Thor!

1064
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:08,332
太晚了
We're too late.

1065
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:11,798
天体汇聚效应已达到峰值
The Convergence is at its peak.

1066
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:13,791
这东西能阻止他吗?
Can those things stop him?

1067
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:15,009
在这儿可不行
Not from here.

1068
01:35:15,168 --> 01:35:17,967
我们无法接近他
We can't get close enough.

1069
01:35:19,005 --> 01:35:20,257
我可以
I can.

1070
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:46,574
玛勒基斯!
Malekith!

1071
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:57,211
黑暗归来 阿斯加德人
Darkness returns, Asgardian.

1072
01:35:57,335 --> 01:36:00,712
你是来见证你们世界的末日的吗?
Have you come to witness the end of your universe?

1073
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:02,761
我来接受你的投降
I've come to accept your surrender.

1074
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:24,412
你觉得自己能阻止我?
You think you can stop this?

1075
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27,912
以太是无敌的
The Aether cannot be destroyed.

1076
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,705
但你不是
But you can.

1077
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:17,248
索尔! 不
Thor! No.

1078
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:28,639
简!
Jane!

1079
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:51,199
啊!
Ah!

1080
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:00,925
大家都没事吧?
Everybody okay?

1081
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,426
他会回来的
He's gonna come back.

1082
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,801
只不过 要知道
Except, you know,

1083
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:54,177
他上次一走就差不多两年
last time he was gone for, like, two years.

1084
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,101
现在只过了两天 所以...
Well, it's only been two days, so...

1085
01:38:58,015 --> 01:38:59,858
他走前说什么了吗?
Did he say anything before he left?

1086
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:02,227
说了 他说他要和他老爸处理一些事情
Yeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father.

1087
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:06,358
他救我出来的时候... 犯了什么叛国罪
He kinda committed treason... on our way out.

1088
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:12,242
哦
Oh.

1089
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:19,542
你曾说过没有比我更加英明的君主
You once said there would never be a wiser king than me.

1090
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:20,705
你错了
You were wrong.

1091
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:25,250
九星连珠将九界团结到了一起
The Alignment has brought all the realms together.

1092
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:28,380
所有人都看到你为了拯救他们而视死如归
Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them.

1093
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:33,472
阿斯加德应该给予你什么报答呢?
What can Asgard offer its new king in return?

1094
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:36,512
自由地生活
My life.

1095
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:40,432
父王 我不能做阿斯加德之主
Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.

1096
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:45,234
我会为阿斯加德和九界战斗到死
I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath,

1097
01:39:45,354 --> 01:39:47,607
但在王位上 我却做不到
but I cannot do so from that chair.

1098
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:51,862
洛基过去胡作非为 但他懂我永远也学不会的治国方略
Loki, for all his grave imbalance, understood rule as I know I never will.

1099
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:55,536
残忍 牺牲...
The brutality, the sacrifice...

1100
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:57,240
这些改变了你
it changes you.

1101
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:00,666
我宁愿做一个好人 也不想当一个圣君
I'd rather be a good man than a great king.

1102
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:06,124
这是你自己决定的 还是你的爱人希望的?
Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves?

1103
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:08,674
当你说话的时候 我又何尝没看到母后的影子?
When you speak, do I never hear Mother's voice?

1104
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:13,298
这不是为了简 父王
This is not for Jane, Father.

1105
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:15,800
她并不知道我来这说了什么
She does not know what I came here to say.

1106
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:19,146
现在 无论是阻止我见她 还是说她左右了我的选择
Now, forbid me to see her, or say she can rule at my side.

1107
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:20,606
都于事无补
It changes nothing.

1108
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:24,527
一个儿子渴望王位
One son who wanted the throne too much,

1109
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,564
另一个却避之不及
another who will not take it.

1110
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:29,857
这就是我的结局?
Is this my legacy?

1111
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,617
洛基死得很光荣
Loki died with honor.

1112
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:34,027
而我会活得像他一样光荣
I shall try to live the same.

1113
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:35,450
这样的结局还不够好吗?
Is that not legacy enough?

1114
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,801
如果你配得上它
It belongs to you.

1115
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:51,378
就归你了
If you are worthy of it.

1116
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:53,882
我会努力的
I shall try to be.

1117
01:40:55,299 --> 01:41:00,021
我不会为你祷告 也不会为你祈福
I cannot give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.

1118
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:02,645
我知道
I know.

1119
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:08,821
即使我将来真的以你为荣
If I were proud of the man my son had become,

1120
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:11,657
我也不会说出来
even that, I could not say.

1121
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:17,781
只会深藏心里
It would speak only from my heart.

1122
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:20,578
去吧
Go,

1123
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:23,161
我的孩子
my son.

1124
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:26,540
谢谢你 父王
Thank you, Father.

1125
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:43,185
不
No.

1126
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,188
我得谢谢你
Thank you.

1127
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
不要走开 精彩稍后继续

1130
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:06,619
我来向你们介绍
I present to you,

1131
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:10,828
这位是"收集者"坦利亚・蒂万
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

1132
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:13,501
喔...
Whoa...

1133
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:21,135
是阿斯加德人 荣幸之至
Asgardians, it's an honor.

1134
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:26,936
你知道我们为何而来
You know why we're here.

1135
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,562
当然
Of course.

1136
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:35,645
但请容我一问
But, if I may ask,

1137
01:44:35,811 --> 01:44:39,691
为什么不把它保存在阿斯加德里?
why not keep it secure in your own vault?

1138
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:42,739
宇宙魔方已经在阿斯加德了
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.

1139
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:46,410
把两块拥有超强能量的石头放在一起很不明智
It is not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.

1140
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,534
确实
That's very wise.

1141
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:00,753
我可以向你保证
I can assure you,

1142
01:45:02,004 --> 01:45:07,226
把它放在我的收藏里
it will be absolutely safe here,

1143
01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:11,931
会非常安全
in my collection.

1144
01:45:13,098 --> 01:45:15,521
最好如此
See that it is.

1145
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:36,581
拿到一个
One down.

1146
01:45:38,082 --> 01:45:40,585
还有五个
Five to go.
