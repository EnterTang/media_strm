1
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,337
I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

2
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:19,841
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.

3
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:24,711
And I would expect you, of all people, would
understand my feelings on misuse of power.

4
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:28,876
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

5
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,581
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.

6
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:35,091
You're here because I need you.

7
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:37,855
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?

8
00:01:37,996 --> 00:01:41,796
No. This one's special.

9
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:45,862
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?

10
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:48,529
Yeah, the brochure is great.

11
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:52,575
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?

12
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:55,043
- Illness?
- John.

13
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,375
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?

14
00:01:57,515 --> 00:02:01,315
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.

15
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:03,819
Of course.

16
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:06,482
Jean, can you come down, dear?

17
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:19,527
We'll leave you, then.

18
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:33,648
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.

19
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:37,346
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?

20
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:40,754
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.

21
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:44,985
Really? I doubt that.

22
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,604
Oh, Charles.

23
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:06,807
I like this one.

24
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:09,453
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.

25
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:13,320
The question is, will you control that power?

26
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,255
Or let it control you?

27
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:42,049
Warren? Son, is everything all right?

28
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:46,682
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.

29
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:50,352
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.

30
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,594
Open the door. Warren.

31
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:55,995
One second!

32
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:00,234
Open this door.

33
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:02,067
Warren.

34
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:06,943
Let me in there right now. Open the door.

35
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:23,994
Oh, God.

36
00:04:24,128 --> 00:04:25,791
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

37
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:27,455
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

38
00:05:54,686 --> 00:06:00,488
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.

39
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:11,761
Bobby!

40
00:06:18,276 --> 00:06:20,676
Thanks, Kitty.

41
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:31,886
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.

42
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,154
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.

43
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,662
That was my last cigar.

44
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,494
Logan.

45
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:49,068
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

46
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:51,733
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.

47
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:55,606
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.

48
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:58,773
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.

49
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:02,182
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

50
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:21,699
Class dismissed.

51
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,077
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.

52
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:32,280
Simulation complete.

53
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:38,915
- What was that?
- Danger room session.

54
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,853
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.

55
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:44,086
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.

56
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:47,289
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.

57
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:51,198
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?

58
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:55,396
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.

59
00:07:55,506 --> 00:07:59,840
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

60
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:19,025
- Scott!
- Jean.

61
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:21,529
Scott. Scott.

62
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,725
Scott.

63
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:26,026
Scott.

64
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:29,202
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

65
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:33,877
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.

66
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:38,107
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.

67
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:41,616
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?

68
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:46,348
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

69
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,320
- They were looking for you. You didn't show.
- What do you care?

70
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:55,625
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.

71
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,758
No, you didn't. The professor did.

72
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:01,464
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.

73
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:03,597
Hey, look.

74
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:08,845
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.

75
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:13,779
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

76
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:20,750
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.

77
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,114
- Mr. Secretary.
- Yes.

78
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:50,677
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.

79
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,825
Mr. President.

80
00:09:57,962 --> 00:10:00,021
Have a seat, Hank.

81
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:04,525
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.

82
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:08,264
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.

83
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:13,435
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

84
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:16,206
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.

85
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:19,805
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.

86
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:22,977
Yes, sir. She can do that.

87
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,147
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?

88
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:30,887
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.

89
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:33,223
Where is Magneto?

90
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:35,931
Raven?

91
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:40,629
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.

92
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:43,865
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

93
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:47,467
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?

94
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:51,605
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

95
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:55,610
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?

96
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,415
In here with us.

97
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,559
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.

98
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:08,187
You don't want to play games with me?

99
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:12,861
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

100
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:16,202
You wanna know where he is?

101
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:26,216
Homo sapien.

102
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,884
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

103
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:37,984
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

104
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:41,997
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.

105
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:46,502
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.

106
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:50,198
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.

107
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:53,072
It's what she stole from the FDA.

108
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:01,141
Dear Lord.

109
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:05,551
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.

110
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:11,261
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?

111
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:17,300
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.

112
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:23,806
When an individual acquires great power,

113
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:27,775
the use or misuse of that power is everything.

114
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:34,545
Will it be for the greater good or will it
be used for personal or for destructive ends?

115
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:37,415
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

116
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:40,183
Why? Because we are mutants.

117
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:43,122
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.

118
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,720
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

119
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:50,492
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

120
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:54,502
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern

121
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,970
without any superhuman authority behind it.

122
00:12:57,108 --> 00:13:00,703
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.

123
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:07,848
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.

124
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:11,854
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.

125
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:16,722
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.

126
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:20,627
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

127
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:23,859
say a father of four with terminal cancer,

128
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:26,469
into the body of this man?

129
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:32,440
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

130
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:46,980
Professor?

131
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:53,125
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.

132
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:02,831
The forecast was for sunny skies.

133
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:06,500
I'm sorry.

134
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:20,356
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.

135
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,423
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,

136
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:27,554
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?

137
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:32,534
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.

138
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:35,730
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

139
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,934
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.

140
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:44,537
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.

141
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:50,921
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.

142
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:53,615
He took Jean's death so hard.

143
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:55,884
Yes, things are better out there,

144
00:14:55,993 --> 00:15:00,020
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.

145
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,691
There's something you're not telling us.

146
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:14,577
Hank?

147
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:16,703
Ororo. Charles.

148
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:22,309
I love what you've done with your hair.

149
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:26,253
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

150
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:30,020
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.

151
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:32,322
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?

152
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:35,523
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

153
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:40,229
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?

154
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:42,805
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

155
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:45,671
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.

156
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:48,471
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.

157
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:51,946
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.

158
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:54,073
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.

159
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:58,018
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.

160
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:01,613
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

161
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,625
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

162
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:07,822
- Suppress?
- Permanently.

163
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:10,730
They're calling it a cure.

164
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:16,873
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.

165
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:20,205
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?

166
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:22,472
Storm.

167
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,048
They're announcing it now.

168
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:33,418
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.

169
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:36,617
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,

170
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:39,763
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.

171
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:43,264
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.

172
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:46,598
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,

173
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:50,663
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.

174
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:52,901
Ladies and gentlemen...

175
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:57,247
I proudly present the answer to mutation.

176
00:16:57,381 --> 00:17:00,782
Finally, we have a cure.

177
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:09,052
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?

178
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:13,562
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?

179
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:15,722
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

180
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:20,736
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.

181
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:24,272
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.

182
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:29,209
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights
since before you had claws.

183
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:33,511
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?

184
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:36,917
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

185
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:41,584
No. Professor.

186
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:43,751
They can't cure us.

187
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:49,922
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.

188
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:52,525
Or any of us, for that matter.

189
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:58,438
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.

190
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:03,673
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.

191
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:09,275
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

192
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:13,516
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.

193
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:19,563
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.

194
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:25,530
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...

195
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:29,230
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.

196
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,830
Nobody is talking about extermination.

197
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:34,705
No one ever talks about it.

198
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:38,737
They just do it.

199
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:45,014
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.

200
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:50,855
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.

201
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:54,829
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

202
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:57,127
the extermination has already begun.

203
00:18:57,234 --> 00:19:01,830
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

204
00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:04,907
They will force their cure upon us.

205
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,647
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?

206
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:14,011
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

207
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:17,245
Who will you stand with? The humans?

208
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:20,881
Or us?

209
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:32,967
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.

210
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,265
Back off.

211
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:39,604
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?

212
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:44,241
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.

213
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:47,282
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.

214
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:50,215
You know who you're talking to?

215
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,379
Do you?

216
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:57,152
And what can you do?

217
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:00,493
So you have talents?

218
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:03,691
That and more. I know you control metal.

219
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:07,862
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.

220
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:09,996
Other than you two.

221
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:15,979
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

222
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:19,879
Could you locate one for me?

223
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:42,969
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.

224
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:46,701
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.

225
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:48,607
Oh, Mr. President.

226
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:50,770
Shut up.

227
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:58,678
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.

228
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,449
Please.

229
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:04,357
Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch.

230
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:10,329
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.

231
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,493
Yeah, right.

232
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:43,967
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.

233
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:46,399
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.

234
00:21:46,503 --> 00:21:51,270
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.

235
00:21:51,942 --> 00:21:54,775
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.

236
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:59,440
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?

237
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:03,451
Until we can fully map his DNA.
We can replicate it, but we can't generate it.

238
00:22:03,553 --> 00:22:05,987
And his power? What is its range?

239
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:08,114
You'll see.

240
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:13,792
Jimmy.

241
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:17,458
There's someone I would like you to meet.

242
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,592
Hello there, son.

243
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,602
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.

244
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:31,813
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:34,844
It's OK.

246
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:47,654
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.

247
00:22:57,474 --> 00:22:59,738
Extraordinary, isn't he?

248
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:02,970
Yes, he is.

249
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:41,881
Scott.

250
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,495
Scott.

251
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:55,958
Scott.

252
00:23:56,099 --> 00:24:00,160
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.

253
00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:02,771
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

254
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:05,569
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

255
00:24:05,742 --> 00:24:08,108
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.

256
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:11,044
Stop!

257
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:09,896
Jean?

258
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:13,038
Scott.

259
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:17,544
How?

260
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:23,576
I don't know.

261
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:40,360
I wanna see your eyes.

262
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,598
- Take these off.
- No.

263
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:48,611
No.

264
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:51,373
Trust me. I can control it now.

265
00:25:59,523 --> 00:26:02,253
Open them. You can't hurt me.

266
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:40,961
- What happened?
- No clue.

267
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:44,761
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.

268
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:16,564
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?

269
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:41,989
I can't see a damn thing.

270
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:44,424
I can take care of that.

271
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:02,803
What the...

272
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:39,208
Logan!

273
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:46,952
She's alive.

274
00:28:50,994 --> 00:28:53,554
Jean.

275
00:28:55,965 --> 00:29:01,301
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.

276
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:03,633
The only explanation of Jean's survival

277
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:09,508
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.

278
00:29:10,847 --> 00:29:12,337
Is she gonna be OK?

279
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:18,148
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant
I've ever encountered, her potential limitless.

280
00:29:18,254 --> 00:29:22,987
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

281
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:27,587
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers

282
00:29:27,697 --> 00:29:30,257
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

283
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:36,397
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?

284
00:29:36,506 --> 00:29:42,467
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.

285
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:48,643
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.

286
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:55,055
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.

287
00:29:56,459 --> 00:30:00,452
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.

288
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:05,796
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

289
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:09,338
or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free.

290
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:12,374
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.

291
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:18,004
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.

292
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:20,446
What have you done to her?

293
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,077
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.

294
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,212
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?

295
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:30,793
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.

296
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:35,091
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.

297
00:30:35,198 --> 00:30:38,133
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.

298
00:30:38,268 --> 00:30:42,034
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

299
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:46,006
It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.

300
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:50,478
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.

301
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:01,181
History will be made here today.
For the first time,

302
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:04,624
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.

303
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:08,060
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.

304
00:31:08,164 --> 00:31:14,399
Some are desperate for this cure while others
are offended by the very idea of it.

305
00:31:27,684 --> 00:31:29,743
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

306
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:35,085
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.

307
00:31:35,191 --> 00:31:38,160
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.

308
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:40,859
Good. Bring him in.

309
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:43,158
Are you sure you want to start with him?

310
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:45,733
I think it's important. Yes.

311
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:49,667
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?

312
00:31:49,806 --> 00:31:52,274
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

313
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:55,173
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.

314
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:58,803
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

315
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:03,410
You ready?

316
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:35,648
The transformation can be a little jarring.

317
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:43,384
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.

318
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:45,460
It'll all be over soon.

319
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:52,429
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.

320
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:54,469
Warren, calm down.

321
00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:56,630
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

322
00:32:56,773 --> 00:32:59,867
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.

323
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:03,776
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.

324
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:13,947
Warren, it's a better life.

325
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:17,618
- It's what we all want.
- No.

326
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:21,127
It's what you want.

327
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:25,694
Warren, no!

328
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:41,400
Told you so.

329
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:58,520
About time.

330
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:02,153
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?

331
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:06,031
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.

332
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:08,899
Without him, they have nothing.

333
00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:11,030
Read off the guest list.

334
00:35:12,308 --> 00:35:16,438
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."

335
00:35:16,546 --> 00:35:18,639
This one robbed seven banks.

336
00:35:24,554 --> 00:35:28,684
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.

337
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:32,456
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.

338
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:40,132
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."

339
00:35:40,236 --> 00:35:44,195
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."

340
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:47,743
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."

341
00:35:47,844 --> 00:35:50,438
How fascinating.

342
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:54,817
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.

343
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:59,047
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.

344
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:14,064
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.

345
00:36:15,404 --> 00:36:19,306
I think he'll make a fine addition to our army.

346
00:36:19,442 --> 00:36:21,410
No!

347
00:36:46,335 --> 00:36:48,803
You saved me.

348
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,405
Eric.

349
00:36:56,746 --> 00:36:59,476
I'm sorry, my dear.

350
00:36:59,582 --> 00:37:02,210
You're not one of us any more.

351
00:37:07,824 --> 00:37:10,884
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.

352
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:20,901
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.

353
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:23,631
Policy is being made without me,
Mr. President.

354
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:26,867
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.

355
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:30,740
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...

356
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:36,046
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.

357
00:37:36,185 --> 00:37:40,451
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

358
00:37:40,556 --> 00:37:42,717
I have.

359
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,388
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.

360
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:51,523
As do I.

361
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:57,499
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.

362
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,838
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.

363
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:31,368
Jean.

364
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:38,611
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.

365
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:47,520
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.

366
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,316
Are you OK?

367
00:38:52,094 --> 00:38:54,119
Yeah.

368
00:38:56,365 --> 00:38:58,390
More than OK.

369
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:13,242
Logan, you're making me blush.

370
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:17,847
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.

371
00:39:21,524 --> 00:39:23,424
It's OK.

372
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,833
It's OK.

373
00:40:18,514 --> 00:40:21,142
- Wait.
- No.

374
00:40:26,622 --> 00:40:28,249
Jean.

375
00:40:28,357 --> 00:40:31,417
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.

376
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:34,496
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.

377
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:40,768
The professor said you might be different.

378
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:45,038
He would know, wouldn't he?

379
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:48,907
What? You think he's not in your head too?

380
00:40:49,045 --> 00:40:53,573
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.

381
00:40:57,953 --> 00:41:00,012
Where's Scott?

382
00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:05,451
Jean?

383
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:09,828
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.

384
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,461
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.

385
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,931
Jean, tell me what happened to him.

386
00:41:31,954 --> 00:41:33,546
Oh, God.

387
00:41:41,297 --> 00:41:43,788
Look at me.

388
00:41:46,335 --> 00:41:49,702
Stay with me. Talk to me.

389
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,636
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

390
00:41:51,774 --> 00:41:53,605
Focus. Focus, Jean.

391
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:58,141
Kill me.

392
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,010
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.

393
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:02,709
- Don't say that.
- Please.

394
00:42:02,852 --> 00:42:05,412
- Stop it.
- Kill me.

395
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,820
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.

396
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:12,689
It'll be all right. We can help you.

397
00:42:13,229 --> 00:42:16,221
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.

398
00:42:16,332 --> 00:42:18,300
I don't want to fix it.

399
00:42:29,578 --> 00:42:33,275
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.

400
00:42:34,817 --> 00:42:36,944
I told you they would draw first blood.

401
00:42:37,086 --> 00:42:39,611
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

402
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:45,683
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.

403
00:42:46,328 --> 00:42:48,853
Come. We have an army to build.

404
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:54,227
I picked something up.

405
00:42:54,336 --> 00:42:57,499
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.

406
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,108
It's a mutant.

407
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:04,305
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.

408
00:43:04,413 --> 00:43:06,779
More powerful than you.

409
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:11,683
Where is she?

410
00:43:14,423 --> 00:43:16,789
Logan.

411
00:43:16,926 --> 00:43:18,985
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?

412
00:43:19,094 --> 00:43:21,153
What have you done?

413
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:28,568
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?

414
00:43:30,472 --> 00:43:33,669
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.

415
00:43:39,248 --> 00:43:45,448
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.

416
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:48,587
It may be too late.

417
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:55,158
- Wait for me here.
- What?

418
00:43:55,297 --> 00:43:57,288
I need to see Jean alone.

419
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,227
You were right, Charles.

420
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:03,736
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?

421
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,831
Same as the professor. Visiting an old friend.

422
00:44:06,942 --> 00:44:09,172
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do I.

423
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:11,303
So, shall we go inside?

424
00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:16,149
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.

425
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:21,381
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.

426
00:44:21,523 --> 00:44:25,289
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

427
00:44:25,394 --> 00:44:27,419
Nobody gets inside.

428
00:45:13,642 --> 00:45:17,772
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.

429
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,714
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.

430
00:45:21,817 --> 00:45:25,344
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

431
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:29,389
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

432
00:45:29,525 --> 00:45:32,323
- So you want to control me?
- He does.

433
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:34,520
No. I want to help you.

434
00:45:35,264 --> 00:45:38,825
Help me? What's wrong with me?

435
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:40,832
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.

436
00:45:40,936 --> 00:45:43,962
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.

437
00:45:44,073 --> 00:45:46,598
For your own good, Jean.

438
00:45:47,276 --> 00:45:49,608
Stay out of my head.

439
00:45:52,715 --> 00:45:56,412
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.

440
00:46:02,658 --> 00:46:06,617
Look at me, Jean. I can help you. Look at me.

441
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:08,754
Get out of my head.

442
00:46:10,466 --> 00:46:15,301
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.

443
00:46:15,404 --> 00:46:18,771
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.

444
00:46:18,874 --> 00:46:23,072
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.

445
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:25,578
No! Stop it!

446
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:30,314
That's it.

447
00:47:12,194 --> 00:47:14,788
Jean, let me in.

448
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:19,089
No, Jean.

449
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:21,219
Jean!

450
00:49:20,055 --> 00:49:22,489
Don't let it control you.

451
00:49:31,466 --> 00:49:33,263
Charles.

452
00:49:59,962 --> 00:50:02,863
My dear. Come with me.

453
00:50:17,546 --> 00:50:19,537
No.

454
00:50:22,818 --> 00:50:24,410
God!

455
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:02,481
We live in an age of darkness.

456
00:51:02,591 --> 00:51:07,324
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.

457
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:12,496
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.

458
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:16,331
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.

459
00:51:17,873 --> 00:51:20,341
A world he tried to heal.

460
00:51:21,343 --> 00:51:24,244
A mission he never saw accomplished.

461
00:51:24,913 --> 00:51:30,010
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.

462
00:51:30,152 --> 00:51:35,454
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.

463
00:51:36,158 --> 00:51:39,127
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.

464
00:51:39,695 --> 00:51:43,131
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.

465
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:51,331
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.

466
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,932
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.

467
00:51:55,043 --> 00:51:58,945
And that's a vision of a world united.

468
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:25,002
Kitty.

469
00:52:26,074 --> 00:52:28,099
Bobby.

470
00:52:31,046 --> 00:52:33,071
- You OK?
- Yeah.

471
00:52:37,185 --> 00:52:41,246
It's just... Xavier came to my house.

472
00:52:42,758 --> 00:52:45,522
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.

473
00:52:45,627 --> 00:52:47,652
Yeah, me too.

474
00:52:47,796 --> 00:52:51,960
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.

475
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:54,262
You have Rogue and I have...

476
00:52:56,071 --> 00:52:58,301
You know, I just miss home.

477
00:52:59,941 --> 00:53:02,273
The first snow and all that.

478
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:08,112
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

479
00:53:08,216 --> 00:53:10,707
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

480
00:53:10,852 --> 00:53:13,446
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.

481
00:53:13,588 --> 00:53:15,318
Come on.

482
00:53:27,196 --> 00:53:29,460
This place can be home too.

483
00:54:08,771 --> 00:54:11,763
Thank you for this, Bobby.

484
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,183
You need a lift, kid?

485
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:32,351
No.

486
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:36,422
Where are you going?

487
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,664
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.

488
00:54:42,772 --> 00:54:45,172
Yeah, I do.

489
00:54:46,308 --> 00:54:49,937
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.

490
00:54:50,045 --> 00:54:53,537
A hug. A handshake.

491
00:54:53,649 --> 00:54:55,583
A kiss.

492
00:54:55,718 --> 00:54:59,210
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.

493
00:55:00,956 --> 00:55:03,424
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

494
00:55:04,293 --> 00:55:06,955
Just be sure it's what you want.

495
00:55:08,464 --> 00:55:11,160
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

496
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:13,326
To go upstairs and unpack?

497
00:55:13,469 --> 00:55:16,632
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.

498
00:55:18,908 --> 00:55:21,843
Just think about what I said, Rogue.

499
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,502
Marie.

500
00:55:24,713 --> 00:55:26,908
Marie.

501
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:11,191
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when I looked at you?

502
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:17,323
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.

503
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:25,262
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"

504
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:33,580
I can manipulate the metal in this,

505
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:37,174
but you, you can do anything.

506
00:56:37,286 --> 00:56:39,550
Anything you can think of.

507
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,292
Jean.

508
00:56:52,401 --> 00:56:54,426
Enough.

509
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:57,930
Enough.

510
00:57:00,276 --> 00:57:02,506
You sound just like him.

511
00:57:02,611 --> 00:57:05,546
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.

512
00:57:05,681 --> 00:57:09,742
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.

513
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:12,814
As nature intended.

514
00:57:14,623 --> 00:57:20,755
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.

515
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,328
And that fight begins now.

516
00:57:33,008 --> 00:57:35,704
She shouldn't be here with us.

517
00:57:35,811 --> 00:57:39,577
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.

518
00:57:39,715 --> 00:57:43,151
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.

519
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:49,121
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.

520
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:53,319
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.

521
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:59,231
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.

522
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:18,085
So what now? What do we do?

523
00:58:18,187 --> 00:58:21,748
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.

524
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:27,760
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.

525
00:58:27,863 --> 00:58:33,699
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.

526
00:58:38,707 --> 00:58:41,369
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

527
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:45,811
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

528
00:58:45,914 --> 00:58:47,973
It was, son.

529
00:58:51,687 --> 00:58:55,851
And it still is. We'll find you a room.

530
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:59,894
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

531
00:59:13,976 --> 00:59:16,001
Rogue.

532
00:59:16,945 --> 00:59:19,004
Hey, Rogue.

533
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:32,490
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.

534
00:59:45,841 --> 00:59:48,071
Logan.

535
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,734
Logan.

536
00:59:49,845 --> 00:59:51,642
- Logan.
- Jean?

537
00:59:52,314 --> 00:59:54,544
Logan. Where am I? Logan.

538
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,581
Logan. Logan.

539
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:59,017
- Logan.
- Stop.

540
00:59:59,121 --> 01:00:01,453
Logan. Logan. Logan.

541
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:25,007
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

542
01:00:25,114 --> 01:00:28,982
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.

543
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,518
She killed the professor.

544
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:34,953
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.

545
01:00:36,825 --> 01:00:39,259
Listen, why can't you see the truth?

546
01:00:39,361 --> 01:00:43,092
- Why can't you just let her go?
- Because... because...

547
01:00:43,198 --> 01:00:45,257
Because you love her.

548
01:00:55,144 --> 01:00:57,840
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.

549
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:01,143
So if you're with us, then be with us.

550
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:17,432
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

551
01:01:17,766 --> 01:01:21,099
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

552
01:01:21,336 --> 01:01:24,032
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

553
01:01:24,406 --> 01:01:28,103
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

554
01:01:29,278 --> 01:01:34,841
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?

555
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:37,646
I'm looking for someone.

556
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:41,881
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.

557
01:01:43,292 --> 01:01:47,285
I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic.

558
01:01:51,466 --> 01:01:53,491
Come on, Iceman.

559
01:01:55,237 --> 01:01:57,262
Make a move.

560
01:02:02,644 --> 01:02:06,341
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.

561
01:02:18,627 --> 01:02:21,858
Today's attack was only our first salvo.

562
01:02:21,964 --> 01:02:25,866
So long as the cure exists, our war will rage.

563
01:02:25,968 --> 01:02:32,373
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.

564
01:02:32,474 --> 01:02:36,376
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...

565
01:02:36,478 --> 01:02:39,276
Join us or stay out of our way.

566
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:43,340
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.

567
01:02:44,753 --> 01:02:49,315
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.

568
01:02:50,325 --> 01:02:54,318
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.

569
01:02:54,429 --> 01:02:58,559
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

570
01:02:58,667 --> 01:03:02,330
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.

571
01:03:02,437 --> 01:03:08,637
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.

572
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:11,975
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.

573
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,708
Let's go. Keep it moving.

574
01:03:14,816 --> 01:03:18,479
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.

575
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:22,114
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

576
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:26,353
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.

577
01:03:26,528 --> 01:03:28,553
Absolutely no metal.

578
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:43,074
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

579
01:03:43,378 --> 01:03:47,940
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

580
01:03:50,485 --> 01:03:54,387
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

581
01:06:12,494 --> 01:06:17,898
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.

582
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:26,134
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition
called homo sapiens.

583
01:06:28,243 --> 01:06:30,302
They have their weapons.

584
01:06:31,313 --> 01:06:33,372
We have ours.

585
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:41,845
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.

586
01:06:43,091 --> 01:06:49,553
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.

587
01:06:50,265 --> 01:06:52,927
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,

588
01:06:53,034 --> 01:06:55,229
take control of the cure,

589
01:06:55,337 --> 01:06:57,737
and destroy its source.

590
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:01,536
And then nothing can stop us.

591
01:07:16,725 --> 01:07:18,522
Jean.

592
01:07:31,106 --> 01:07:34,269
I know the smell of your domatium
from a mile away.

593
01:07:34,376 --> 01:07:37,277
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.

594
01:07:37,445 --> 01:07:42,940
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?

595
01:07:51,726 --> 01:07:55,560
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

596
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:59,292
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.

597
01:07:59,467 --> 01:08:02,903
And you stood there and let him die?

598
01:08:03,038 --> 01:08:06,633
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.

599
01:08:20,088 --> 01:08:22,113
OK.

600
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:26,858
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.

601
01:08:27,996 --> 01:08:32,956
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

602
01:08:34,936 --> 01:08:39,566
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.

603
01:08:40,675 --> 01:08:44,008
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

604
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:22,746
Approaching target dead ahead.

605
01:09:22,851 --> 01:09:25,342
Set for 360-degree incursion.

606
01:09:37,732 --> 01:09:41,463
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.

607
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:48,135
OK, send them in.

608
01:09:48,243 --> 01:09:49,437
OK.

609
01:09:49,577 --> 01:09:53,980
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!

610
01:10:08,463 --> 01:10:11,159
OK. I give up.

611
01:10:12,133 --> 01:10:14,431
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.

612
01:10:14,569 --> 01:10:17,538
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?

613
01:10:25,747 --> 01:10:29,911
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.

614
01:10:30,051 --> 01:10:33,384
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.

615
01:10:33,488 --> 01:10:37,219
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.

616
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:39,918
Leave that to me.

617
01:10:44,999 --> 01:10:48,162
Storm. Storm.

618
01:10:48,269 --> 01:10:51,033
What are you doing back here?

619
01:10:51,139 --> 01:10:53,164
I need help.

620
01:10:53,274 --> 01:10:56,072
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.

621
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:59,044
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.

622
01:10:59,147 --> 01:11:04,449
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

623
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:08,010
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.

624
01:11:08,123 --> 01:11:10,182
Let's suit up.

625
01:11:14,362 --> 01:11:18,492
- Hard to believe this once fit me.
- If Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.

626
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,569
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.

627
01:11:21,703 --> 01:11:27,369
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.

628
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:31,410
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

629
01:11:31,546 --> 01:11:34,071
I'm not gonna lie to you.

630
01:11:34,182 --> 01:11:36,548
But we lost Scott.

631
01:11:36,651 --> 01:11:38,778
We lost the professor.

632
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:43,880
If we don't fight now,
everything they stood for will die with them.

633
01:11:44,559 --> 01:11:46,754
I'm not gonna let that happen.

634
01:11:46,895 --> 01:11:48,920
Are you?

635
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:52,123
Then we stand together.

636
01:11:53,435 --> 01:11:55,835
X-Men.

637
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:57,962
All of us.

638
01:12:04,546 --> 01:12:06,878
We're in.

639
01:12:07,015 --> 01:12:09,074
Let's go.

640
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:16,056
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.

641
01:12:17,192 --> 01:12:22,357
But are you ready to do what you need to do
when the time comes?

642
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:51,918
Dad, what's going on?

643
01:13:53,254 --> 01:13:55,279
It's an earthquake.

644
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:01,328
We're trapped.

645
01:16:04,686 --> 01:16:08,452
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

646
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,832
My God.

647
01:16:50,465 --> 01:16:53,866
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

648
01:17:09,317 --> 01:17:13,276
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.

649
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:16,720
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!

650
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:36,408
In chess, the pawns go first.

651
01:17:39,046 --> 01:17:41,606
Humans and their guns.

652
01:17:50,525 --> 01:17:53,392
Plastic. They've learned.

653
01:17:59,534 --> 01:18:02,367
That's why the pawns go first.

654
01:18:11,913 --> 01:18:14,609
Target the bridge.

655
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:23,020
Fire!

656
01:18:29,797 --> 01:18:34,564
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.

657
01:18:54,422 --> 01:18:58,620
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.

658
01:19:00,995 --> 01:19:05,022
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.

659
01:19:05,166 --> 01:19:08,932
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.

660
01:19:09,837 --> 01:19:11,828
Then God help us.

661
01:19:21,682 --> 01:19:23,707
They're coming for him.

662
01:19:57,652 --> 01:20:00,780
Don't ever do that again.

663
01:20:06,527 --> 01:20:08,722
You men cover the doors!

664
01:20:08,829 --> 01:20:12,094
Everybody get together! And hold this line!

665
01:20:27,848 --> 01:20:30,612
Traitors to their own cause.

666
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:39,385
Finish them!

667
01:21:14,662 --> 01:21:16,323
Not yet.

668
01:21:31,078 --> 01:21:33,808
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.

669
01:21:33,914 --> 01:21:35,973
With pleasure.

670
01:21:41,789 --> 01:21:44,451
Hold it!

671
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,385
He's going for the boy!

672
01:21:48,496 --> 01:21:50,726
Not if I get there first.

673
01:21:50,865 --> 01:21:52,924
Kitty!

674
01:22:03,244 --> 01:22:05,303
Come on.

675
01:22:08,482 --> 01:22:10,382
Grow those back.

676
01:22:21,062 --> 01:22:23,087
Don't you know who I am?

677
01:22:24,098 --> 01:22:26,692
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

678
01:22:58,566 --> 01:23:00,625
Going somewhere?

679
01:23:04,171 --> 01:23:06,799
You're the guy that invented the cure, right?

680
01:23:06,907 --> 01:23:08,932
Yes, I am.

681
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:11,505
Girls.

682
01:23:11,645 --> 01:23:13,943
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

683
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:17,279
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.

684
01:23:17,384 --> 01:23:19,614
Calm down. Calm down.

685
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,984
Everything's gonna be OK.

686
01:23:40,007 --> 01:23:45,968
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."

687
01:23:46,113 --> 01:23:48,673
Oh, you get the point.

688
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:51,910
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.

689
01:23:52,019 --> 01:23:53,247
No.

690
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:04,193
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.

691
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,896
This way.

692
01:24:08,002 --> 01:24:12,962
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.

693
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:19,009
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.

694
01:24:22,449 --> 01:24:24,679
I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with.

695
01:24:24,785 --> 01:24:27,310
Who's hiding, dickhead?

696
01:24:38,766 --> 01:24:40,666
Don't. No.

697
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,298
Don't.

698
01:24:43,404 --> 01:24:47,306
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.

699
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:50,340
Do we look like we need your help?

700
01:25:20,374 --> 01:25:22,535
It's time to end this war.

701
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,289
Take cover.

702
01:25:37,725 --> 01:25:39,625
Get out of the way.

703
01:25:50,871 --> 01:25:54,500
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.

704
01:25:54,642 --> 01:25:56,200
Go! Go! Go!

705
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:47,760
We work as a team.

706
01:26:47,861 --> 01:26:50,853
Best defense is a good offence.

707
01:26:56,603 --> 01:27:00,539
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?

708
01:27:12,886 --> 01:27:14,911
Go ahead.

709
01:27:16,156 --> 01:27:18,681
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.

710
01:27:18,826 --> 01:27:20,851
Right.

711
01:28:09,443 --> 01:28:12,503
You're in over your head, Bobby.

712
01:28:12,613 --> 01:28:15,582
Maybe you should go back to school.

713
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:28,724
You never should have left.

714
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,091
This is it.

715
01:28:32,232 --> 01:28:34,200
Hey.

716
01:28:34,334 --> 01:28:37,269
Make it a strike.

717
01:28:47,948 --> 01:28:50,473
You never learn, do you?

718
01:28:52,052 --> 01:28:55,544
Actually, I do.

719
01:29:09,069 --> 01:29:11,264
I'm...

720
01:29:11,371 --> 01:29:14,033
One of them?

721
01:29:24,117 --> 01:29:27,450
This is what they want for all of us.

722
01:29:48,475 --> 01:29:50,375
It's over, Jean.

723
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,905
It's over.

724
01:29:58,118 --> 01:30:00,109
No! Don't shoot!

725
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,932
No!

726
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:35,112
Everybody get out of there!

727
01:30:43,630 --> 01:30:45,689
Bobby!

728
01:30:55,809 --> 01:30:57,868
What have I done?

729
01:31:08,655 --> 01:31:12,989
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.

730
01:31:13,126 --> 01:31:15,594
Go.

731
01:31:19,166 --> 01:31:20,895
Jean!

732
01:32:06,113 --> 01:32:08,172
Jean!

733
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:10,715
I know you're still there!

734
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:59,892
You would die for them?

735
01:33:01,001 --> 01:33:03,060
No, not for them.

736
01:33:04,271 --> 01:33:06,296
For you.

737
01:33:08,308 --> 01:33:10,299
For you.

738
01:33:15,315 --> 01:33:17,374
Save me.

739
01:33:19,252 --> 01:33:20,913
I love you.

740
01:35:00,253 --> 01:35:02,881
You're back.

741
01:35:09,229 --> 01:35:11,720
I'm sorry.

742
01:35:11,865 --> 01:35:13,856
I had to.

743
01:35:14,734 --> 01:35:17,760
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.

744
01:35:18,839 --> 01:35:21,307
It's what I want.

745
01:35:33,587 --> 01:35:35,214
Hey.

746
01:35:36,156 --> 01:35:38,420
Good to see you, buddy.

747
01:35:38,558 --> 01:35:41,220
With the thanks of a grateful nation

748
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:44,489
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,

749
01:35:44,664 --> 01:35:48,828
and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,

750
01:35:48,935 --> 01:35:51,768
human and mutant alike,

751
01:35:51,872 --> 01:35:53,931
Dr. Hank McCoy.

752
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:59,374
Way to go, fur ball.

753
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:49,971
Morning.

754
01:43:54,387 --> 01:43:57,117
Hello, Moira.

755
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:05,190
Charles.
