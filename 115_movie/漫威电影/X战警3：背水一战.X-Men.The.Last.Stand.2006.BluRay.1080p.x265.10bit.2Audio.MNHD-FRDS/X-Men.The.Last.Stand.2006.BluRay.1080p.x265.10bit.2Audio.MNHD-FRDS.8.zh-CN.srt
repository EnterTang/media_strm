1
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,110
片名:
X战警:最后战役

2
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,433
葛蕾宅

3
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:10,928
二十年前

4
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:16,764
我实在不懂,你不能
用超能力让他们同意吗?
I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

5
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,268
可以,但那不是我的方法
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.

6
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:24,570
你该明白
我反对滥用超能力
And I would expect you, of all people, would
understand my feelings on misuse of power.

7
00:01:24,676 --> 00:01:27,907
权力腐化人心
又来了,好,我知道
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

8
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:32,006
-你何时才会停止说教?
-等到你把话听进去为止
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.

9
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:34,518
我要你来是因为我需要你
You're here because I need you.

10
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:39,023
我们不用
个别拜访所有学生吧?
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?

11
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:41,183
不用,但这个很特别
No. This one's special.

12
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,556
X学校

13
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:47,963
-很美的校园,老公,你觉得呢?
-册子印刷得很好
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?
Yeah, the brochure is great.

14
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:52,059
不过琴呢?她的病怎么办?
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?

15
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,259
病?
- lllness?
- John.

16
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,803
你认为你女儿有病?
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?

17
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,742
也许该让我们单独跟她谈谈
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.

18
00:02:00,812 --> 00:02:03,246
当然
Of course.

19
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:05,909
琴?你能下来吗?
Jean, can you come down, dear?

20
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:19,386
那就交给你们了
We'll leave you, then.

21
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:33,075
未经允许就擅自读心
是很失礼的
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.

22
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:36,773
你以为你是独一无二的?
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?

23
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:40,181
我们是变种人,我们跟你一样
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.

24
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:44,412
真的?我很怀疑
Really? I doubt that.

25
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,904
Oh, Charles.

26
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:06,235
查而斯
我喜欢这孩子
I like this one.

27
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:12,749
你拥有比你想像中更强的力量
问题是,你能控制它吗?
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.
The question is, will you control that power?

28
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:17,683
还是你会被它控制?
Or let it control you?

29
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:25,829
十年前

30
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:41,476
华伦?
儿子?你还好吧?
Warren? Son, is everything all right?

31
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:46,106
-怎么回事?
-没事,我马上出去
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.

32
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:49,779
你已经在里面超过一个小时了
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.

33
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:53,021
快开门,华伦?
Open the door. Warren.

34
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:55,422
等一下
One second!

35
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,661
快开门
Open this door.

36
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:01,367
Warren.

37
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,359
华伦?让我进去,快开门
Let me in there right now. Open the door.

38
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,410
老天爷
Oh, God.

39
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:26,888
-这怎么可能
-爸,对不起
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

40
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:26,755
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

41
00:05:19,844 --> 00:05:22,972
不远的未来

42
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,915
世界即将毁灭
你们却还坐在这里?
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.

43
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,188
巴比
Bobby!

44
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,103
谢了,幻影猫
Thanks, Kitty.

45
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:31,313
-我们快玩完了
-他们还没准备好
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.

46
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:35,581
-罗根！
-别碎碎念
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.

47
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,852
那是我最后一根雪茄
That was my last cigar.

48
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,794
Logan.

49
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:48,495
-罗根,它逼近了
-继续行动
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

50
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:51,160
钢人,过来
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.

51
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:55,033
-你的手臂有力吗?
-罗根,我们要团队合作
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.

52
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:58,200
祝你合作愉快
把我扔过去,就是现在
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.

53
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:01,609
罗根,别这么做
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

54
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,126
下课
Class dismissed.

55
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:26,493
钢人,扔的好
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.

56
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:31,707
模拟结束
Simulation complete.

57
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:38,106
-那算什么?
-危机模拟课
- What was that?
- Danger room session.

58
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:40,275
-你知道我在说什么
-别紧张嘛
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.

59
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:44,549
-别乱改规矩,我在设法教他们
-我是教了他们东西
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.

60
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:46,589
那应该是防守练习
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.

61
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:50,625
攻击是最佳防守
还是倒过来说?
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?

62
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:54,824
-这不是游戏
-你还真是唬倒我了
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.

63
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:59,268
我是代课老师
有问题找史考特
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

64
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,111
-史考特
-琴
- Scott!
- Jean.

65
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:22,784
我需要你,史考特
史考特、史考特
Scott. Scott.

66
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:23,025
Scott.

67
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:25,326
Scott.

68
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:28,629
-你还好吧?
-我很好
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

69
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:33,304
你看起来不大好,你在躲我
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.

70
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:37,534
除了我碰男友他就会死
之外都好
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.

71
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,043
我有给过你压力吗?
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?

72
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:45,775
你是男人,你想的只有一件事
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

73
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,747
-大家都在找你,你没现身
-你在乎什么?
- They were looking for you. You didn't show.
- What do you care?

74
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,053
-我得掩护你
-我没请你掩护
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.

75
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:57,185
你是没有,教授有
No, you didn't. The professor did.

76
00:08:57,262 --> 00:09:00,891
-我只是过来看看
-看过就走吧,罗根
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.

77
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:03,024
听着
Hey, look.

78
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:08,261
-我知道你的感觉,当琴...
-别说了
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.

79
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:13,206
我们该继续活下去
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

80
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:20,177
我不像你能愈合得那么快
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.

81
00:09:23,454 --> 00:09:25,684
变种人事务部

82
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:27,657
美国科学杂志
『追踪变种人』

83
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:44,541
部长先生?
- Mr. Secretary.
- Yes.

84
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:50,104
-会议已经开始了
-谢谢
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.

85
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:52,647
美国总统

86
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:57,253
总统先生?
Mr. President.

87
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:59,448
坐,老亨
Have a seat, Hank.

88
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,952
国土安全部
之前追踪万磁王
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.

89
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,691
里斯本、日内瓦、蒙特娄
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.

90
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:12,862
卫星追丢了,不过却逮到二奖
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

91
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:15,633
我们逮到她
闯入食品药物管理局
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.

92
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,232
知道她模仿谁吗?
崔思克部长
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.

93
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,404
是啊,她做得到
Yes, sir. She can do that.

94
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:26,574
-到此为止,我们逮到她了
-你的监狱关不住她
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?

95
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:30,314
我们有新式监狱
随时移动,制敌机先
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.

96
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,651
万磁王人呢?
Where is Magneto?

97
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,358
瑞雯?
Raven?

98
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:40,056
-瑞雯,我问你问题
-我不回应我的奴隶名
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.

99
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:43,292
瑞雯达克霍,那是你的真名
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

100
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:46,895
或者他说服你,你没有家人?
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?

101
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:51,806
我的家人想杀我,你这个烂人
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

102
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:55,037
好,那么,魔形女
他在哪里?
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?

103
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,581
在这里跟我们一起
In here with us.

104
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:04,986
我不想玩游戏,我要答案
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.

105
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:07,614
你不想玩游戏?
You don't want to play games with me?

106
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:12,288
给我住手,说,万磁王在哪?
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

107
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:15,629
要知道他人在哪里?
You wanna know where he is?

108
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:25,643
臭人类！
Homo sapien.

109
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:37,417
她被捕只会激怒万磁王
不过有了她,我们就有胜算
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

110
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:37,284
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

111
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:41,424
基于原则
我不能跟这些人协商
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.

112
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:45,929
-那不就是你指派我的原因吗?
-是的
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.

113
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,625
-不过那不是你召我来的原因
-不是,这才是
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.

114
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:52,499
这是她从食品药物管理局偷的
It's what she stole from the FDA.

115
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:56,799
沃辛实验室
抑制变种人基因

116
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,568
老天爷
Dear Lord.

117
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,978
-这可行吗?
-我们相信可行
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.

118
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,280
你明白
这对变种人会有多大冲击
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?

119
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:16,724
我明白,所以我们现在
需要你的外交手腕
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.

120
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:27,204
当一个个体具备超能力
运用或误用就会影响一切
When an individual acquires great power,
the use or misuse of that power is everything.

121
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:33,972
是为整体福祉?
或是为个人私利或毁灭世界?
Will it be for the greater good or will it
be used for personal or for destructive ends?

122
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,536
我们必须自问这个问题
为什么
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

123
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:39,483
Why? Because we are mutants.

124
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:42,422
因为我们是变种人
就心灵而言,这代表某种问题
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.

125
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:47,147
何时能运用我们的能力
以及我们何时会跨越误用的界限
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

126
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,919
使我们变成暴君
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

127
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:56,398
但爱因斯坦说道德规范是
人类的事,与超自然力量无关
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern

128
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:56,270
without any superhuman authority behind it.

129
00:12:56,501 --> 00:13:00,130
就我们所知
爱因斯坦并不是变种人
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.

130
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,275
莫拉博士寄给我一份研究报告
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.

131
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:11,179
这个人出生时没有高阶的脑力
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.

132
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:16,152
器官神经系统正常
但他毫无意识
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.

133
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:20,054
若我们移转一个有四个孩子的
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

134
00:13:20,124 --> 00:13:25,892
...罹癌父亲的意识进去会怎样?
say a father of four with terminal cancer,

135
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,769
into the body of this man?

136
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:31,868
我们该如何决定什么是
合乎道德规范的行止,什么是...
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

137
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:46,407
教授?
Professor?

138
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:52,552
我们明天再继续上
下课
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.

139
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:02,258
预报说今天晴空万里
The forecast was for sunny skies.

140
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,927
对不起
I'm sorry.

141
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:19,783
我不用读心
也知道你心里有事
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.

142
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:24,113
万磁王成逃犯,内阁有变种人
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,

143
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,985
总统又善良,我们为何还要躲?
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?

144
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:31,961
我们没躲
我们还是有敌人,我得保护学生
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.

145
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:35,157
对
不过我们不能永远当学生
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

146
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:38,361
暴风女
我早就不把你们当学生了
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.

147
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:43,964
事实上
我想你有一天能取代我
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.

148
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,337
-不过史考特...
-史考特变了
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.

149
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:53,042
琴的死让他发狂
He took Jean's death so hard.

150
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,311
对,情况有好转
Yes, things are better out there,

151
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:59,447
不过你们知道
世事如天气般多变
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.

152
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:03,118
你有事没告诉我们
There's something you're not telling us.

153
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:13,027
老亨
Hank?

154
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:16,363
查而斯
Ororo. Charles.

155
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:21,736
我喜欢你的新发型
I love what you've done with your hair.

156
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:25,680
你也一样
谢谢你愿意见我
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

157
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,447
随时欢迎,你是这里的一份子
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.

158
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,750
-我有消息
-跟艾瑞克有关?
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?

159
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:34,950
没,但有进展
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

160
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:39,656
-魔形女已被捕
-这毛球是谁啊?
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?

161
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:45,100
-亨利麦寇,变种人事务部长
-是啊,部长,西装不错
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

162
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,971
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.

163
00:15:45,202 --> 00:15:47,830
-亨利,这是罗根,他是...
-金钢狼
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.

164
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:51,375
-听说你像野兽般勇猛
-瞧瞧说话的是谁啊
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.

165
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:55,138
-万磁王会来救魔形女
-他不是问题
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.

166
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,441
至少不是最迫切的
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.

167
00:15:57,548 --> 00:16:04,044
有家制药公司研发出变种抗体
可以压抑变种基因
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

168
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:03,925
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

169
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:07,249
-压抑?
-永久有效
- Suppress?
- Permanently.

170
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:10,158
医生称之为解药
They're calling it a cure.

171
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:16,289
太可笑了,你不能治愈变种人
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.

172
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:21,896
-从科学上来说...
-我们何时成了一种疾病了?
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?

173
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,772
Storm.

174
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,464
暴风女
他们正在宣布
They're announcing it now.

175
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,846
这些变种人是人,跟我们一样
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.

176
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:39,185
他们感染到的只是一种疾病
影响了健康的细胞活动
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,

177
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:39,063
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.

178
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,691
不过我在此宣布
你们会有希望
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.

179
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,025
这里曾经是世上最知名的监狱
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,

180
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:50,090
现在将成为解放变种人的基地
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.

181
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:56,663
各位女士先生
我在此呈现变种的解决方式
Ladies and gentlemen...

182
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:56,547
I proudly present the answer to mutation.

183
00:16:56,774 --> 00:17:00,210
我们终于有了治疗的针剂
Finally, we have a cure.

184
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:08,480
谁想治疗?
懦夫才会想融入人群
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?

185
00:17:08,552 --> 00:17:12,955
拯救受迫害的人算懦夫吗?
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?

186
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:15,151
融入人群不容易
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

187
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:20,163
-你又不会掉毛
-这可能是政府主导的
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.

188
00:17:20,264 --> 00:17:23,700
-他们与此毫无关系
-那句话我以前就听说过了
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.

189
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:28,636
孩子,我在你有爪子之前
就为变种人奋斗
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights
since before you had claws.

190
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:32,938
-他叫我孩子?
-是真的吗?他们能治好我们?
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?

191
00:17:33,944 --> 00:17:36,344
是啊,看来是真的
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

192
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:41,011
不,教授
No. Professor.

193
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:43,383
他们无法治愈我们
They can't cure us.

194
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:49,349
知道原因吗?因为没有需要
不只是你
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.

195
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:51,952
所有变种人都没问题
Or any of us, for that matter.

196
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,355
社区行动会议
人类勿入
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.

197
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:57,867
变种人该怎么回应?

198
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:03,100
我们要组织起来
将我们的抗议传达给正确的人
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.

199
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:08,509
我们要组织委员会跟政府对话
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

200
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:12,948
他们不了解变种人,不懂得
我们有什么特别
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.

201
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:18,978
我们要展现给他们看、教育他们
让他们知道我们会继续存在
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.

202
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:24,957
听我说
他们不会认真对待我们,除非...
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...

203
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,657
-他们想灭绝我们
-治疗是自愿的
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.

204
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:34,136
-没人说要灭绝
-根本没人提过这点
Nobody is talking about extermination.
No one ever talks about it.

205
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:38,164
他们直接付诸行动
They just do it.

206
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:44,441
你们要是继续忽视这些征兆
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.

207
00:18:44,548 --> 00:18:50,282
有一天,空气静止、黑夜降临
他们就会找上你们
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.

208
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:54,256
你们要明白
当你们还在组织时
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

209
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:58,694
灭绝行动已然展开,不会错的
the extermination has already begun.

210
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:01,263
他们会先展开攻击
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

211
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:04,334
他们会强迫我们接受治疗
They will force their cure upon us.

212
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:10,063
问题是
你们要加入我们一起奋战
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?

213
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,438
还是要坐以待毙?
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

214
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:16,672
你们要站在哪一边?人类?
Who will you stand with? The humans?

215
00:19:18,215 --> 00:19:20,308
还是我们?
Or us?

216
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:32,394
你这穿着怪披风
撂狠话的家伙
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.

217
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,693
退开
Back off.

218
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:39,031
你很自傲是变种人,你的记号呢
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?

219
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,668
我向你保证,我曾被做过记号
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.

220
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:46,709
不准任何针头再碰触我的皮肤
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.

221
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,643
你知道你在跟谁说话吗?
You know who you're talking to?

222
00:19:49,713 --> 00:19:51,806
你呢?
Do you?

223
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:56,580
你有啥能耐?
And what can you do?

224
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:59,920
你很有天份吗?
So you have talents?

225
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,118
此外还有其他东西
我知道你能控制金属品
That and more. I know you control metal.

226
00:20:03,194 --> 00:20:07,290
还有,这里有87个变种人
这么多人之中
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.

227
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,662
只有你们两个高于第三级
Other than you two.

228
00:20:10,935 --> 00:20:15,395
你能感测到其他变种人的能力?
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

229
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:19,306
你能为我找出其中一位吗?
Could you locate one for me?

230
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:42,396
让我出去！我命令你释放我
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.

231
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:46,128
知道我是谁吗?我是美国总统
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.

232
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:48,034
总统?
Oh, Mr. President.

233
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:50,197
给我闭嘴！
Shut up.

234
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:58,105
你为什么要这么对我?放我下来
我是个好女孩,求你,放我走
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.

235
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,876
求求你
Please.

236
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,784
再继续这样
我会赏你一脸喷雾,贱人
Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch.

237
00:21:04,955 --> 00:21:09,756
等我出去
我要亲手宰了你
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.

238
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:11,920
是啊
Yeah, right.

239
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:45,593
-麦寇部长,欢迎莅临沃辛实验室
-谢谢,这里不太容易来
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.

240
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:50,691
这是最安全的地点
所以我们才将治疗资源放这
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.

241
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:54,133
他是变种人,你明白我们的立场
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.

242
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:58,538
-我们完全遵守贵部政策
-他要待在这里多久?
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?

243
00:21:58,642 --> 00:22:02,874
直到将他的DNA定位
我们能复制,却无法重制
Until we can fully map his DNA.
We can replicate it, but we can't generate it.

244
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,414
他有什么能力?
And his power? What is its range?

245
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:07,541
你会看到的
You'll see.

246
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:13,219
吉米?
Jimmy.

247
00:22:13,324 --> 00:22:16,885
我想让你见一个人
There's someone I would like you to meet.

248
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,019
你好,孩子
Hello there, son.

249
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:22,029
-嗨
-我叫亨利麦寇
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.

250
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,240
对不起
I'm sorry.

251
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:34,272
没关系
It's OK.

252
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,081
你有惊人的天赋
谢谢你,吉米
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.

253
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:59,165
很特别,不是吗?
Extraordinary, isn't he?

254
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:02,397
是啊
Yes, he is.

255
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:41,181
Scott.

256
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:55,514
史考特?史考特?
史考特?史考特?
Scott.
Scott.

257
00:23:55,626 --> 00:23:59,585
-你听得见我吗?我还在这里
-停
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.

258
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:02,722
-我在这里
-停！
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

259
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:04,869
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

260
00:24:05,135 --> 00:24:07,535
史考特
史考特
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.

261
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:10,471
-停！琴?
-史考特?
Stop!

262
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:09,196
Jean?

263
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:12,338
Scott.

264
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:16,971
怎么会?
How?

265
00:25:20,944 --> 00:25:23,003
我不知道
I don't know.

266
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:39,992
我想看你的眼睛
I wanna see your eyes.

267
00:25:41,932 --> 00:25:44,025
把这拿掉
- Take these off.
- No.

268
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:47,911
No.

269
00:25:48,138 --> 00:25:50,800
-不
-相信我,我现在能控制它了
Trust me. I can control it now.

270
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:01,680
张开眼睛
你伤害不了我
Open them. You can't hurt me.

271
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:30,144
史考特、史考特

272
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:40,388
-怎么回事?
-毫无头绪
- What happened?
- No clue.

273
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:44,188
-教授,你还好吧?
-快去阿卡利湖
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.

274
00:27:12,556 --> 00:27:15,992
-你不想来的
-你想吗?
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?

275
00:27:38,982 --> 00:27:41,416
我什么都看不到
I can't see a damn thing.

276
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:43,851
这我可以搞定
I can take care of that.

277
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,230
搞什么?
What the...

278
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,508
Logan!

279
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:46,379
罗根
她还活着
She's alive.

280
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:51,549
琴?
Jean.

281
00:28:55,358 --> 00:29:00,728
卷走琴的那股大水
照理应该完全消灭了她
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.

282
00:29:00,831 --> 00:29:07,600
她活命的唯一解释是
她的心灵能量形成防护罩
The only explanation of Jean's survival

283
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,808
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.

284
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:11,764
她会好吗?
Is she gonna be OK?

285
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:17,575
琴是我遇过唯一的
第五级变种人,她的潜力几近无穷
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant
I've ever encountered, her potential limitless.

286
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:22,414
她的能力深植于她的潜意识
那是很危险的
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

287
00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:27,014
她小时候,我制造了心灵围栏
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers

288
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:34,758
将她能力隔绝于理性之外
结果她发展出双重人格
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

289
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:36,924
-什么意思?
-理性的琴
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?

290
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:41,902
她的能力受到控制
而冬眠的另一边
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.

291
00:29:41,972 --> 00:29:48,070
是一种我们在课堂上称为
┌火凤凰」的个性
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.

292
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:54,483
纯粹本能的动物
只为欲望、享乐和愤怒所驱使
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.

293
00:29:55,852 --> 00:29:59,879
-她知道这些吗?
-她了解多少并不清楚
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.

294
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:05,223
更重要的是
眼前是我们熟悉的琴
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

295
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:08,594
...还是想挣脱枷锁
的愤怒火凤凰
or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free.

296
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:11,793
-她看起来很平和
-我在让她保持平和
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.

297
00:30:11,902 --> 00:30:17,431
我想恢复心灵围栏
困住怪兽
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.

298
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:21,170
-你对她做了什么?
-你得明白...
What have you done to her?

299
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,648
-你说的是琴的心灵
-她必须受到控制
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.

300
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,512
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?

301
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,208
有时困住怪兽
怪兽反而更生气
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.

302
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,518
你不明白她的能力有多恐怖
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.

303
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:37,560
不,我不明白你有多恐怖
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.

304
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:41,256
这很艰难,但我做了选择
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

305
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:45,427
听起来琴根本就毫无选择
It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.

306
00:30:45,502 --> 00:30:49,905
我不用为自已辩护
至少对你不用
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.

307
00:30:58,014 --> 00:31:03,919
历史即将被创造,随着变种疗方
全面上市
History will be made here today.
For the first time,

308
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:03,924
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.

309
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:07,479
变种人各界都有强烈反应
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.

310
00:31:07,557 --> 00:31:13,826
有些急欲施打此疗方
其他则激烈反对它的存在
Some are desperate for this cure while others
are offended by the very idea of it.

311
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,174
麦寇部长会有问题吗?
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

312
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,512
很难说,他的政治观点
似乎与他个人冲突
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.

313
00:31:34,584 --> 00:31:37,576
抱歉,您的公子来了
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.

314
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:40,286
好,让他进来
Good. Bring him in.

315
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,157
-你确定要从他开始?
-我想这很重要
Are you sure you want to start with him?
I think it's important. Yes.

316
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,094
-你好,华伦
-你好吗,儿子?
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?

317
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,690
睡得好吗?
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

318
00:31:51,768 --> 00:31:54,601
你这么做我很骄傲
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.

319
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:58,231
一切都不会有问题的
我保证
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

320
00:32:00,744 --> 00:32:02,837
准备好了?
You ready?

321
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:35,075
转变时会有点不舒服
The transformation can be a little jarring.

322
00:32:39,182 --> 00:32:44,882
-爸,我们能谈谈吗?
-我们谈过了,一切很快就会结束
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.
It'll all be over soon.

323
00:32:46,156 --> 00:32:51,856
-不会有问题的
-等等,我做不到
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.

324
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:53,896
华伦,冷静点
Warren, calm down.

325
00:32:53,964 --> 00:32:56,057
-我做不到
-你可以的
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

326
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:59,294
放轻松就好
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.

327
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:03,203
-我保证不会有问题！放轻松！
-爸
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.

328
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,374
华伦,人生会更美好
Warren, it's a better life.

329
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:17,045
那是我们都想要的
- It's what we all want.
- No.

330
00:33:18,188 --> 00:33:20,554
不,那是你想要的
It's what you want.

331
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:24,994
Warren, no!

332
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:40,827
我早说过了
Told you so.

333
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:57,947
也该是时候了
About time.

334
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,581
我很忙
找到你要找的东西了?
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?

335
00:35:01,658 --> 00:35:05,458
源头是
在沃辛实验室的变种小孩
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.

336
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:08,326
没有他,他们就没得玩了
Without him, they have nothing.

337
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,457
念出房客名单
Read off the guest list.

338
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:15,865
41205号:分身人
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."

339
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,066
他在同一时间...
This one robbed seven banks.

340
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:28,111
-抢了七间银行
-我用得上你这种人
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.

341
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,883
-我加入
-欢迎加入我们
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.

342
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:39,560
-这个要小心
-凯因马可,单独监禁
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."

343
00:35:39,629 --> 00:35:43,622
听听这个
┌囚犯必须全身受限」
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."

344
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,158
他若得到动力,势不可挡
"lf he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."

345
00:35:47,237 --> 00:35:49,865
真迷人
How fascinating.

346
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:54,233
-他们叫你什么?
-红坦克
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.

347
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:58,474
-我不明白
-放我出去,我要尿尿
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.

348
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:13,491
-不错的头盔
-让我的脸更有帅劲
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.

349
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:18,790
他能让我们的军队更声势浩大
I think he'll make a fine addition to our army.

350
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:20,710
No!

351
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:48,219
你救了我
You saved me.

352
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:53,705
Eric.

353
00:36:56,139 --> 00:36:58,903
抱歉,亲爱的
I'm sorry, my dear.

354
00:36:58,975 --> 00:37:01,637
你已经不是我们的一员了
You're not one of us any more.

355
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:10,311
真可惜,她本来很美的
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.

356
00:37:16,492 --> 00:37:22,556
-你以为辞职可以影响政策?
-政策未经我同意就制定了
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.

357
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:22,931
Policy is being made without me,
Mr. President.

358
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:26,294
未经我同意就用治疗剂当武器
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.

359
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:30,168
行动监狱的意外不可原谅,而你
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...

360
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,473
老亨,那是单一事件
那些变种人很危险
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.

361
00:37:35,578 --> 00:37:39,878
你这是游走在钢索之上
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

362
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:42,144
我知道
I have.

363
00:37:43,753 --> 00:37:48,850
我担心当某个人能用心志移动
整个城市时,民主将荡然无存
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.

364
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:50,950
我也一样
As do l.

365
00:37:54,163 --> 00:37:56,927
我们都知道情况只会变得更糟
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.

366
00:37:57,033 --> 00:38:01,265
我也更该要待在我所属的地方
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.

367
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,668
Jean.

368
00:38:35,171 --> 00:38:38,038
-你好
-欢迎回来
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.

369
00:38:41,077 --> 00:38:46,947
回到我们初次见面的地方
只不过你我的位置互换
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.

370
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:49,743
你还好吧?
Are you OK?

371
00:38:51,487 --> 00:38:53,546
还好
Yeah.

372
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:57,817
比还好更好
More than OK.

373
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:12,669
你让我很不好意思
Logan, you're making me blush.

374
00:39:14,077 --> 00:39:17,274
-你在读我的心?
-我根本不用读
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.

375
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:22,851
没关系
It's OK.

376
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:39,260
没关系的
It's OK.

377
00:40:17,907 --> 00:40:20,569
-等等
-不
- Wait.
- No.

378
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:27,549
Jean.

379
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,878
-琴,这不是你
-是的,这是我
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.

380
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:33,922
也许你该放轻松点
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.

381
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:40,195
教授说
你可能会有点不一样
The professor said you might be different.

382
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:44,465
他最了解了,对不对?
He would know, wouldn't he?

383
00:40:44,534 --> 00:40:48,334
怎么?
你想他没在你脑子里动手脚?
What? You think he's not in your head too?

384
00:40:48,438 --> 00:40:53,000
看看你,罗根
他驯服了你
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.

385
00:40:57,346 --> 00:40:59,439
史考特人呢?
Where's Scott?

386
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,751
Jean?

387
00:41:05,888 --> 00:41:09,255
-我在哪里?
-在基地里
- Where am l?
- You're in the mansion.

388
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:13,888
你得告诉我史考特怎么了
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.

389
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:19,358
琴,他怎么了?
Jean, tell me what happened to him.

390
00:41:31,347 --> 00:41:32,974
天哪
Oh, God.

391
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,215
看着我
Look at me.

392
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:49,129
专心看着我
Stay with me. Talk to me.

393
00:41:49,232 --> 00:41:51,063
看着我
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

394
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:53,032
专心,琴
Focus. Focus, Jean.

395
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,568
杀了我
Kill me.

396
00:41:57,673 --> 00:42:00,437
-什么?
-在我继续杀人之前杀了我
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.

397
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,137
-别说那种话
-拜托
- Don't say that.
- Please.

398
00:42:02,245 --> 00:42:04,839
-别说了
-杀了我
- Stop it.
- Kill me.

399
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,247
别说了,看着我,琴
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.

400
00:42:09,352 --> 00:42:12,116
不会有事的,我们可以帮你
It'll be all right. We can help you.

401
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:15,648
教授可以帮你,他能修正一切
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.

402
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:17,716
我不想被修正
I don't want to fix it.

403
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:32,702
自愿?他们把治愈剂放入枪里
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.

404
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,371
我说过他们会先展开攻击
I told you they would draw first blood.

405
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:39,039
我们怎么办?
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

406
00:42:39,115 --> 00:42:45,111
我们用这武器当避雷针
吸引更多的志士
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.

407
00:42:45,721 --> 00:42:48,281
来吧,我们要建立一支军队
Come. We have an army to build.

408
00:42:51,561 --> 00:42:56,931
我侦测到东西
一股电磁力,庞大无比
I picked something up.
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.

409
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,524
是变种人
It's a mutant.

410
00:42:59,602 --> 00:43:03,732
第五级,是我感受过最强大的
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.

411
00:43:03,806 --> 00:43:06,206
比你还强
More powerful than you.

412
00:43:09,245 --> 00:43:11,110
她在哪里?
Where is she?

413
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:16,089
Logan.

414
00:43:17,753 --> 00:43:20,586
-发生什么事了?
-你做了什么?
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?
What have you done?

415
00:43:25,094 --> 00:43:27,995
-我想她杀了史考特
-什么?
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?

416
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:33,096
-那是不可能的
-我警告过你
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.

417
00:43:38,641 --> 00:43:44,876
她离开了,她想阻挡我的侦测
她好强
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.

418
00:43:46,115 --> 00:43:48,015
可能太迟了
It may be too late.

419
00:43:48,484 --> 00:43:51,578
葛蕾家

420
00:43:52,822 --> 00:43:54,585
-在这里等我
-什么?
- Wait for me here.
- What?

421
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,420
我要单独去见琴
I need to see Jean alone.

422
00:43:57,493 --> 00:43:59,654
你说的很对
You were right, Charles.

423
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:03,163
-这一个很特别
-你来这里做什么?
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?

424
00:44:03,232 --> 00:44:06,292
跟查而斯一样
拜访一个老朋友
Same as the professor. Visiting an old friend.

425
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:08,599
-我不想惹事生非
-我也不想
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do l.

426
00:44:08,671 --> 00:44:10,969
我们进去吧?
So, shall we go inside?

427
00:44:13,175 --> 00:44:17,305
-我来带琴回家,别妨碍我
-就跟以前一样
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.

428
00:44:17,413 --> 00:44:20,814
她需要帮忙,琴病了
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.

429
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:24,716
真好笑,你的口气就像她父母
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

430
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,846
不准任何人进来
Nobody gets inside.

431
00:45:13,035 --> 00:45:17,233
-我就知道你会来
-我来带你回家
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.

432
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:21,139
-我没有家
-你有的,你有家也有家人
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.

433
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,771
他认为你无法控制你的力量
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

434
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,873
我不认为
你的心灵游戏这回有用
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

435
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:30,543
你想控制我?
- So you want to control me?
- He does.

436
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:31,745
-不是的
-他想

437
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,584
我想帮助你
No. I want to help you.

438
00:45:34,657 --> 00:45:38,252
帮助我?我有什么问题?
Help me? What's wrong with me?

439
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,294
-绝对没问题
-艾瑞克！
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.

440
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:43,388
不,查而斯,你总是阻碍她
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.

441
00:45:43,466 --> 00:45:46,026
为你自已好
For your own good, Jean.

442
00:45:46,669 --> 00:45:49,035
滚出我的脑袋
Stay out of my head.

443
00:45:52,108 --> 00:45:55,839
-我要进去
-教授说他能解决
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.

444
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:06,044
看着我,琴
我能帮助你,看着我
Look at me, Jean. I can help you. Look at me.

445
00:46:06,122 --> 00:46:08,181
滚出我的脑袋
Get out of my head.

446
00:46:09,859 --> 00:46:14,728
-也许你该听她的话
-你这是危及你自已和所有人
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.

447
00:46:14,797 --> 00:46:18,198
-我能帮你
-你想让她打治疗剂
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.

448
00:46:18,267 --> 00:46:23,705
看看史考特出了什么事
你控制不了自已,杀了你爱的人
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.

449
00:46:23,773 --> 00:46:25,001
住口！
No! Stop it!

450
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,741
够了
That's it.

451
00:47:11,587 --> 00:47:14,215
琴,让我进去
不,琴！
Jean, let me in.

452
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:18,389
No, Jean.

453
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:20,519
Jean!

454
00:49:19,448 --> 00:49:21,916
别让它控制你
Don't let it control you.

455
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:31,617
查而斯！
Charles.

456
00:49:59,355 --> 00:50:02,290
亲爱的,跟我来吧
My dear. Come with me.

457
00:50:16,846 --> 00:50:18,837
No.

458
00:50:22,118 --> 00:50:23,710
God!

459
00:50:58,814 --> 00:51:01,908
这是个黑暗的年代
We live in an age of darkness.

460
00:51:01,984 --> 00:51:06,751
世界充满恐惧、仇恨和偏见
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.

461
00:51:07,623 --> 00:51:11,923
不过每个年代,都有人在奋战
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.

462
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,758
X教授生在一个分裂的世界里
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.

463
00:51:17,266 --> 00:51:19,757
一个他想治愈的世界
A world he tried to heal.

464
00:51:20,736 --> 00:51:23,671
这是他无法亲自完成的任务
A mission he never saw accomplished.

465
00:51:24,306 --> 00:51:29,437
伟人总是
无法看到自已的目标达成
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.

466
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:34,881
X教授不只是一位领袖
不只是一位导师,他也是朋友
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.

467
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,543
当我们恐惧时,他给我们力量
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.

468
00:51:39,088 --> 00:51:42,546
当我们孤独时,他给我们一个家
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.

469
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:50,758
他也许走了,不过他的教诲
我们、学生们都永远铭记在心
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.

470
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:54,360
不论我们去哪
都会继承他的理想
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.

471
00:51:54,436 --> 00:51:58,372
那个理想就是世界和平
And that's a vision of a world united.

472
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:23,723
幻影猫
Kitty.

473
00:52:25,467 --> 00:52:26,695
巴比?
Bobby.

474
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:32,498
-你还好吧?
-还好
- You OK?
- Yeah.

475
00:52:36,578 --> 00:52:40,674
只是...教授曾来过我家
It's just... Xavier came to my house.

476
00:52:42,151 --> 00:52:44,949
他说服我来到这里
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.

477
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,079
我也是
Yeah, me too.

478
00:52:47,189 --> 00:52:51,387
-我们都有相同的感受
-不,我们不是
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.

479
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,690
你有小淘气,而我却...
You have Rogue and I have...

480
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,728
我很想家
You know, I just miss home.

481
00:52:59,334 --> 00:53:01,700
还有冬天的第一场雪
The first snow and all that.

482
00:53:04,206 --> 00:53:07,539
-跟我来
-暴风女要我们留在房里
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

483
00:53:07,609 --> 00:53:10,134
不会有人知道的
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

484
00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:14,705
你能穿墙而过,来吧
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.

485
00:53:12,888 --> 00:53:14,618
Come on.

486
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:29,026
这里也可以是你家
This place can be home too.

487
00:54:08,303 --> 00:54:11,329
谢谢你,巴比
Thank you for this, Bobby.

488
00:54:27,623 --> 00:54:30,023
需要送你一程吗?
You need a lift, kid?

489
00:54:29,592 --> 00:54:31,651
No.

490
00:54:33,929 --> 00:54:36,489
你要去哪?
Where are you going?

491
00:54:37,532 --> 00:54:43,334
你不知道惧怕自已能力的感觉
害怕靠近任何人
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.

492
00:54:43,438 --> 00:54:45,770
我知道
Yeah, I do.

493
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:49,504
我希望能碰触别人
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.

494
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:53,105
拥抱、握手
A hug. A handshake.

495
00:54:53,181 --> 00:54:55,149
亲吻
A kiss.

496
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,777
希望你不是
为了某个男人而这么做
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.

497
00:55:00,489 --> 00:55:02,980
听着,如果你想走,那就走吧
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

498
00:55:03,825 --> 00:55:06,521
只是要确定你要的是什么
Just be sure it's what you want.

499
00:55:07,996 --> 00:55:10,726
你不是该叫我留下吗?
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

500
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,892
上楼去把行李放下?
To go upstairs and unpack?

501
00:55:13,001 --> 00:55:16,198
我不是你父亲,我是你朋友
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.

502
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,409
想想我刚刚说的话,小淘气
Just think about what I said, Rogue.

503
00:55:21,476 --> 00:55:23,103
我叫玛莉
Marie.

504
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,569
玛莉
Marie.

505
00:56:04,353 --> 00:56:10,758
还记得我们第一次见面吗?
你知道我在你身上看到了什么?
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when I looked at you?

506
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:16,889
我看到下一个阶段的革命
那是我和查而斯梦寐以求的
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.

507
00:56:18,367 --> 00:56:24,829
我想,查而斯为何要将这个女神
变成凡人?
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"

508
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:36,743
我能控制这里面的金属
但是你,你能为所欲为
I can manipulate the metal in this,

509
00:56:32,982 --> 00:56:36,474
but you, you can do anything.

510
00:56:36,818 --> 00:56:39,116
任何你想得到的事
琴
Anything you can think of.

511
00:56:49,499 --> 00:56:51,592
Jean.

512
00:56:51,933 --> 00:56:53,992
够了
Enough.

513
00:56:55,904 --> 00:56:57,496
够了！
Enough.

514
00:56:59,808 --> 00:57:02,072
你的口气跟他一样
You sound just like him.

515
00:57:02,144 --> 00:57:05,136
他想压制你的能力
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.

516
00:57:05,247 --> 00:57:09,308
-你想要什么?
-我要你做你自已
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.

517
00:57:10,152 --> 00:57:12,382
就如老天的安排
As nature intended.

518
00:57:14,156 --> 00:57:20,322
那种治疗剂的目标是我们全体
我们要自由,就得奋战到底
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.

519
00:57:21,596 --> 00:57:23,894
而这场奋战现在已经展开
And that fight begins now.

520
00:57:32,541 --> 00:57:35,066
她不该跟我们在一起
She shouldn't be here with us.

521
00:57:35,143 --> 00:57:39,136
-她的能力很不稳定
-除非被不对的人控制
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.

522
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:42,705
-你信任她?她是他们的一份子
-你以前也是
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.

523
00:57:42,818 --> 00:57:48,688
我一直效命于你
如果你让我动手,我早杀了教授
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.

524
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:52,886
查而斯为变种人付出太多了
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.

525
00:57:52,961 --> 00:57:58,797
我最遗憾的
就是他得为我们而死
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.

526
00:58:14,683 --> 00:58:18,983
-现在呢?我们该做什么?
-查而斯教授创立了学校
So what now? What do we do?

527
00:58:19,087 --> 00:58:21,317
学校也该随他而去
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.

528
00:58:21,423 --> 00:58:27,328
-我们会叫学生们回家
-我们大多都无处可去
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.

529
00:58:27,395 --> 00:58:33,265
我真不敢相信
我们就这么放弃
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.

530
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,936
我知道现在时机不大对
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

531
00:58:41,009 --> 00:58:45,378
我听说这里是变种人的庇护所
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

532
00:58:45,447 --> 00:58:47,540
以前是的,孩子
It was, son.

533
00:58:51,219 --> 00:58:55,417
现在也还是
我们会帮你找个房间
And it still is. We'll find you a room.

534
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:59,449
告诉学生们,学校继续开放
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

535
00:59:13,642 --> 00:59:17,373
小淘气?小淘气
Rogue.

536
00:59:16,245 --> 00:59:18,304
Hey, Rogue.

537
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:32,058
-钢人?你有看见小淘气吗?
-她离开了
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.

538
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:47,371
Logan.

539
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:49,034
Logan.

540
00:59:49,145 --> 00:59:50,942
- Logan.
- Jean?

541
00:59:51,746 --> 00:59:54,112
罗根、罗根、罗根
你听得见我吗?我在哪里?
Logan. Where am l? Logan.

542
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,881
Logan. Logan.

543
00:59:55,917 --> 00:59:58,579
罗根、罗根
别这样
- Logan.
- Stop.

544
00:59:58,421 --> 01:00:00,753
Logan. Logan. Logan.

545
01:00:21,843 --> 01:00:24,573
-你要去哪?
-你想呢?
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

546
01:00:24,646 --> 01:00:28,548
-她走了,她不会回来了
-这点很难说
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.

547
01:00:28,617 --> 01:00:31,085
她杀了教授
She killed the professor.

548
01:00:31,152 --> 01:00:34,519
那不是琴
我认识的琴还在里面
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.

549
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:38,826
-走开
-听着,你为何不能看清事实
Listen, why can't you see the truth?

550
01:00:38,893 --> 01:00:42,659
-为什么不忘了她?
-因为,因为...
- Why can't you just let her go?
- Because... because...

551
01:00:42,731 --> 01:00:44,824
因为你爱她
Because you love her.

552
01:00:54,676 --> 01:01:00,706
她做了选择,我们也要做出选择
若你支持我们,就留在我们这边
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.

553
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,443
So if you're with us, then be with us.

554
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,728
X学校
培养天才少年

555
01:01:13,995 --> 01:01:16,987
我们不需要治疗！
不需要治疗！
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

556
01:01:17,066 --> 01:01:20,399
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

557
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:23,332
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

558
01:01:23,706 --> 01:01:27,403
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

559
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:34,407
想治疗好然后回爸妈身边?
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?

560
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:37,212
我在找人
I'm looking for someone.

561
01:01:38,353 --> 01:01:41,447
我懂了,你的马子
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.

562
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:46,851
我就知道她想治疗
她真可悲
I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic.

563
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:53,058
来啊,冰人
Come on, lceman.

564
01:01:54,769 --> 01:01:56,828
动手啊
Make a move.

565
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:05,908
还是那个老巴比
还是害怕战斗
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.

566
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:21,424
今天的攻击只是第一波
Today's attack was only our first salvo.

567
01:02:21,496 --> 01:02:25,432
只要治疗剂存在
我们就会继续战斗
So long as the cure exists, our war will rage.

568
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:31,928
你们的城市将不再安全,街头
也不再安全,连你也不安全了
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.

569
01:02:32,006 --> 01:02:35,942
至于我的变种人同胞
我请你们
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...

570
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:38,843
加入我们,不然就别挡路
Join us or stay out of our way.

571
01:02:38,913 --> 01:02:42,906
已经有太多变种人牺牲了
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.

572
01:02:44,285 --> 01:02:48,881
我们正在设法追踪他
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.

573
01:02:49,858 --> 01:02:53,885
-我们不能让他为所欲为
-我同意
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.

574
01:02:53,962 --> 01:02:58,126
事关国家安全
关闭沃辛实验室
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

575
01:02:58,199 --> 01:03:01,896
我要军队
配备装有治疗剂的枪
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.

576
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:08,205
崔斯克,找出万磁王并阻止他
运用任何必要手段
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.

577
01:03:08,276 --> 01:03:11,541
万磁王想开战,我们就开战
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.

578
01:03:11,613 --> 01:03:14,275
快！继续前进！
Let's go. Keep it moving.

579
01:03:14,349 --> 01:03:18,046
缴回旧式武器,缴回所有金属
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.

580
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:21,680
刺刀、弹药、识别牌
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

581
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:25,920
领取塑胶武器
领取治疗剂填装弹匣
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.

582
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,119
绝对不能带任何金属
Absolutely no metal.

583
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:43,006
我们不需要治疗剂！
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

584
01:03:42,678 --> 01:03:47,240
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

585
01:03:51,553 --> 01:03:53,646
向治疗剂说不
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

586
01:06:12,026 --> 01:06:17,464
同志们,他们想治疗我们
但我告诉你们我们就是治疗剂
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.

587
01:06:20,501 --> 01:06:25,700
治疗衰弱无能的人类
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition
called homo sapiens.

588
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,868
他们有他们的武器
They have their weapons.

589
01:06:30,845 --> 01:06:32,938
我们有我们的
We have ours.

590
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:41,411
我们会以前所未见的愤怒力量
袭击这个世界
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.

591
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:49,119
有任何变种人阻挡我们
我们就用这种毒药对付他们
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.

592
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:57,294
我们要去恶魔岛
控制治疗剂,摧毁它的源头
We shall go to Alcatraz lsland,
take control of the cure,
and destroy its source.

593
01:06:57,372 --> 01:07:01,103
之后我们将无人能挡！
And then nothing can stop us.

594
01:07:16,025 --> 01:07:17,822
Jean.

595
01:07:30,471 --> 01:07:33,838
我大老远就闻到你的臭钢味
I know the smell of your adamantium
from a mile away.

596
01:07:33,908 --> 01:07:36,843
-我不是来找你打架的
-聪明的小子
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.

597
01:07:36,978 --> 01:07:42,507
-我是为琴而来
-你以为她不是自愿待在这里的?
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?

598
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:55,121
-她在这里是因为她想来
-你不知道你面对的是什么
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

599
01:07:55,229 --> 01:07:58,858
我知道
我看过她怎么对付查而斯
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.

600
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,458
而你却眼睁睁的看他丧命?
And you stood there and let him die?

601
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:06,199
-没有她,我不会走
-你非走不可
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.

602
01:08:19,388 --> 01:08:21,413
OK.

603
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:26,424
好,两分钟后会合
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.

604
01:08:27,528 --> 01:08:32,522
我们有万磁王基地的卫星影像
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

605
01:08:34,469 --> 01:08:39,133
-怎么找到的?
-她给了我们一切资讯,还有更多
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.

606
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:43,575
被抛弃的女人的怒火真吓人
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

607
01:09:18,513 --> 01:09:22,313
直接接近前方目标
Approaching target dead ahead.

608
01:09:22,383 --> 01:09:24,908
准备360度袭击
Set for 360-degree incursion.

609
01:09:37,265 --> 01:09:41,031
队长呼叫一号小队
我们随时准备出击
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.

610
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,703
好,开始攻击
OK, send them in.
OK.

611
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:53,547
不准动,变种人！
举起双手！
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!

612
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,589
好啦,我投降
OK. I give up.

613
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,998
这是诱饵,部长
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.

614
01:10:14,101 --> 01:10:17,093
他若不在那里,会在哪里?
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?

615
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:29,477
沃辛实验室,是开端也是结束
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.

616
01:10:29,584 --> 01:10:32,951
-你确定那孩子在里面?
-百分之百确定
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.

617
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,786
我们该怎么过去?
我不会游泳
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.

618
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:39,484
交给我吧
Leave that to me.

619
01:10:44,299 --> 01:10:47,462
Storm. Storm.

620
01:10:47,802 --> 01:10:50,600
暴风女、暴风女
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing back here?

621
01:10:50,671 --> 01:10:52,730
我需要帮忙
I need help.

622
01:10:52,807 --> 01:10:55,332
-你找到她了
-她跟万磁王在一起
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.

623
01:10:55,443 --> 01:10:58,606
-他们在哪里?
-我知道他们要去哪里
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.

624
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:03,776
-你看到万磁王了?
-得走了,他们要攻击恶魔岛
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

625
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:07,581
-岛上有军队
-那不足以阻止他
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.

626
01:11:07,655 --> 01:11:09,748
着装吧
Let's suit up.

627
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:18,058
-这以前穿还很合身
-万磁王拿到针剂就所向无敌了
- Hard to believe this once fit me.
- If Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.

628
01:11:18,132 --> 01:11:21,124
-他有多少人?
-一支军队,还有琴
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.

629
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:26,935
-他的能力有限,她可不然
-我们只有六个人
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.

630
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:30,976
对,我们人单势薄
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

631
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:33,638
我不会骗你
I'm not gonna lie to you.

632
01:11:33,714 --> 01:11:36,114
不过我们失去了史考特
But we lost Scott.

633
01:11:36,183 --> 01:11:38,344
失去了教授
We lost the professor.

634
01:11:38,452 --> 01:11:43,446
一旦放弃
一切就会随他们而去
If we don't fight now,
everything they stood for will die with them.

635
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:46,321
我不打算让那情况发生
I'm not gonna let that happen.

636
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:48,486
你呢?
Are you?

637
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:51,689
那么我们就齐心协力
Then we stand together.

638
01:11:52,967 --> 01:11:55,401
X战警
X-Men.

639
01:11:55,469 --> 01:11:57,528
我们全体
All of us.

640
01:12:04,078 --> 01:12:06,444
我们加入
We're in.

641
01:12:06,547 --> 01:12:08,640
我们走吧
Let's go.

642
01:12:12,653 --> 01:12:15,622
-他们准备好了
-我知道
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.

643
01:12:16,724 --> 01:12:21,923
不过你准备好
采取必要手段了?
But are you ready to do what you need to do
when the time comes?

644
01:13:48,983 --> 01:13:51,474
爸,怎么回事?
Dad, what's going on?

645
01:13:52,787 --> 01:13:54,846
地震！
It's an earthquake.

646
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:00,883
我们被困住了
We're trapped.

647
01:16:04,218 --> 01:16:08,018
查而斯一直想建立沟通的桥梁
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

648
01:16:22,736 --> 01:16:25,398
我的老天
My God.

649
01:16:49,997 --> 01:16:53,433
撤退！撤退！
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

650
01:17:08,849 --> 01:17:12,842
那孩子在东南方的角落
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.

651
01:17:12,953 --> 01:17:16,286
-好极了
-摧毁它
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!

652
01:17:33,073 --> 01:17:35,974
下棋时,小卒先走
In chess, the pawns go first.

653
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:41,173
人类和他们的枪
Humans and their guns.

654
01:17:50,057 --> 01:17:52,958
塑胶的,他们学会了
Plastic. They've learned.

655
01:17:59,066 --> 01:18:01,933
所以才要派小卒先上
That's why the pawns go first.

656
01:18:11,445 --> 01:18:14,175
瞄准桥
Target the bridge.

657
01:18:20,721 --> 01:18:22,586
发射
Fire!

658
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:34,130
震波女,用震波
瞄准那些武器
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.

659
01:18:53,954 --> 01:18:58,186
-我的老天爷
-进入隐形模式
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.

660
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:04,588
-战斗机呢?坦克呢?
-万磁王会把它们压碎
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.

661
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:08,498
-地面部队呢?
-离该处有30分钟远
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.

662
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:11,394
愿上帝帮助我们
Then God help us.

663
01:19:21,215 --> 01:19:23,274
他们来找他了
They're coming for him.

664
01:19:57,184 --> 01:20:00,347
不准你再那么做了
Don't ever do that again.

665
01:20:06,059 --> 01:20:08,289
要你的手下保护大门
You men cover the doors!

666
01:20:08,362 --> 01:20:11,661
大家过来！守住战线！
Everybody get together! And hold this line!

667
01:20:27,381 --> 01:20:30,179
自以为代表正义的叛徒
Traitors to their own cause.

668
01:20:36,323 --> 01:20:38,951
解决他们
Finish them!

669
01:21:14,194 --> 01:21:15,889
还没
Not yet.

670
01:21:30,611 --> 01:21:33,375
去里面找到那男孩,杀了他
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.

671
01:21:33,447 --> 01:21:35,540
我很乐意
With pleasure.

672
01:21:41,321 --> 01:21:44,017
等一等！
Hold it!

673
01:21:45,893 --> 01:21:47,952
他要去找那个男孩
He's going for the boy!

674
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:51,054
只要我先到就行了
Not if I get there first.

675
01:21:50,165 --> 01:21:52,224
Kitty!

676
01:22:02,776 --> 01:22:04,869
幻影猫,来啊！
Come on.

677
01:22:08,015 --> 01:22:09,949
把那些也长回来吧
Grow those back.

678
01:22:20,594 --> 01:22:22,653
你不知道我是谁吗?
Don't you know who I am?

679
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:26,258
我是红坦克,贱人
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

680
01:22:58,098 --> 01:23:00,191
要去哪里?
Going somewhere?

681
01:23:03,704 --> 01:23:07,868
-是你发明了治疗剂吧?
-是的
You're the guy that invented the cure, right?
Yes, I am.

682
01:23:09,343 --> 01:23:11,072
小姐们?
Girls.

683
01:23:11,178 --> 01:23:13,738
不！别伤害他！
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

684
01:23:13,847 --> 01:23:16,839
放开我,这不关我的事
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.

685
01:23:16,917 --> 01:23:19,181
冷静点
Calm down. Calm down.

686
01:23:19,252 --> 01:23:21,550
不会有事的
Everything's gonna be OK.

687
01:23:39,539 --> 01:23:45,535
-我以为你是外交官
-邱吉而说过,该来的...
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."

688
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:48,239
啊,你懂我意思
Oh, you get the point.

689
01:23:50,117 --> 01:23:52,210
不！求求你,不要！
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.

690
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:52,547
No.

691
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:03,759
别害怕
我是来帮你的,我们快出去
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.

692
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:07,462
这边
This way.

693
01:24:07,534 --> 01:24:12,528
-怎么回事?
-你的超能力在我周遭会失效
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.

694
01:24:16,209 --> 01:24:18,575
跟紧一点,好吗?
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.

695
01:24:19,749 --> 01:24:21,979
I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with.

696
01:24:21,982 --> 01:24:26,885
-别想跟我玩躲猫猫
-谁在躲了?你这个猪头！
Who's hiding, dickhead?

697
01:24:36,066 --> 01:24:37,966
Don't. No.

698
01:24:38,835 --> 01:24:40,598
不要！不要！
Don't.

699
01:24:42,936 --> 01:24:46,872
别这样！我只是想帮你们！
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.

700
01:24:47,574 --> 01:24:49,906
我们看起来像需要帮忙吗?
Do we look like we need your help?

701
01:25:17,674 --> 01:25:19,835
It's time to end this war.

702
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:22,101
该结束这场战争了

703
01:25:32,853 --> 01:25:35,845
快找掩护
Take cover.

704
01:25:35,025 --> 01:25:36,925
Get out of the way.

705
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:39,191
躲开

706
01:25:50,403 --> 01:25:54,066
-走吧
-赶快
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.

707
01:25:51,942 --> 01:25:53,500
Go! Go! Go!

708
01:25:54,174 --> 01:25:55,766
快呀

709
01:26:44,357 --> 01:26:47,326
我们要团队合作
We work as a team.

710
01:26:47,394 --> 01:26:50,420
攻击是最佳防守
Best defense is a good offence.

711
01:26:56,136 --> 01:27:00,095
巴比
你能搞定你的老友吗?
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?

712
01:27:10,186 --> 01:27:12,211
Go ahead.

713
01:27:12,419 --> 01:27:14,478
上吧

714
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:18,249
暴风女,我们需要掩护
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.
Right.

715
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:20,417
好

716
01:28:08,975 --> 01:28:12,069
你的能力太差了
You're in over your head, Bobby.

717
01:28:12,145 --> 01:28:15,137
你该回学校去
Maybe you should go back to school.

718
01:28:25,992 --> 01:28:28,290
你不该离开学校的
You never should have left.

719
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:29,391
This is it.

720
01:28:29,462 --> 01:28:31,657
时机到了
Hey.

721
01:28:33,867 --> 01:28:36,836
投个好球吧
Make it a strike.

722
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,040
你永远学不会,对吧?
You never learn, do you?

723
01:28:51,584 --> 01:28:55,111
其实...我学会了
Actually, I do.

724
01:29:06,369 --> 01:29:08,564
I'm...

725
01:29:08,601 --> 01:29:10,831
我...
One of them?

726
01:29:10,904 --> 01:29:13,600
跟他们一样?

727
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:27,017
这就是他们的阴谋
This is what they want for all of us.

728
01:29:45,775 --> 01:29:47,675
It's over, Jean.

729
01:29:48,007 --> 01:29:49,941
一切都结束了,琴

730
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:52,205
It's over.

731
01:29:52,412 --> 01:29:54,471
结束了

732
01:29:55,418 --> 01:29:57,409
No! Don't shoot!

733
01:29:57,650 --> 01:29:59,675
别开枪

734
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:13,232
No!

735
01:30:31,584 --> 01:30:34,678
大家快离开这里
Everybody get out of there!

736
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:42,989
Bobby!

737
01:30:53,109 --> 01:30:55,168
What have I done?

738
01:30:55,341 --> 01:30:57,434
我做了什么?

739
01:31:08,188 --> 01:31:12,557
我是唯一能阻止她的人
让大家到安全的地方
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.

740
01:31:12,659 --> 01:31:15,150
快去！
Go.

741
01:31:16,466 --> 01:31:18,195
Jean!

742
01:32:03,413 --> 01:32:05,472
Jean!

743
01:32:07,847 --> 01:32:10,281
琴！琴！
我知道你还在里面
I know you're still there!

744
01:32:56,763 --> 01:32:59,459
你宁可为他们而死?
You would die for them?

745
01:32:58,301 --> 01:33:00,360
No, not for them.

746
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:02,626
不,不是为他们

747
01:33:01,571 --> 01:33:03,596
For you.

748
01:33:05,608 --> 01:33:07,599
而是为你
For you.

749
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,865
为你

750
01:33:12,615 --> 01:33:14,674
Save me.

751
01:33:14,847 --> 01:33:16,940
救我

752
01:33:16,552 --> 01:33:18,213
I love you.

753
01:33:18,785 --> 01:33:20,480
我爱你

754
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:29,779
琴葛蕾

755

史考特

756
01:34:59,786 --> 01:35:02,448
你回来了?
You're back.

757
01:35:08,761 --> 01:35:11,286
很抱歉
I'm sorry.
I had to.

758
01:35:11,397 --> 01:35:13,422
我一定要去

759
01:35:14,267 --> 01:35:17,327
-这不是我想要的
-我知道
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.

760
01:35:18,371 --> 01:35:20,862
这是我想要的
It's what I want.

761
01:35:30,887 --> 01:35:32,514
Hey.

762
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:37,986
很高兴见到你,孩子
Good to see you, buddy.
With the thanks of a grateful nation

763
01:35:38,661 --> 01:35:41,789
怀着满心的感激
我在此介绍新的联合国大使
I introduce our new ambassador

干得好,毛球

769
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,271
Morning.

770
