你好  汉克
Hello, Hank.

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,080
后期 8T  总监  somehacker

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,530
你应该在莫斯科
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,250
我绕了个道
I took a detour...

14
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,250
去了你的防御实验室
through your defense lab.

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,080
告诉我这不是我想的那个东西
Tell me that isn't what I think it is.

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,720
那得看你是不是认为
That depends if you think

17
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,980
这是意图复制我实验成果的失败品
it's a poor attempt to replicate my work.

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,110
就算是你们三个  这也太胆大了
Even for this group, that takes nerve.

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,610
你受命前往俄罗斯
You were instructed to go to Russia.

20
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,960
我需要提醒你  皮姆博士  你是名军人
May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you're a soldier...

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,900
我是个科学家
I'm a scientist.

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,650
那就有点科学家的样子
Then act like one.

23
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,690
皮姆粒子是从古至今
The Pym Particle is the

24
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,330
最具革命性的科学发明
most revolutionary science ever developed.

25
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,590
帮我们物尽其用
Help us put it to good use.

26
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,980
我让你们把我当仆人一样使唤
I let you turn me into your errand boy,

27
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,350
可你们现在居然试图盗取我的研究
and now you try to steal my research?

28
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,750
要是当时你也像现在这么猛地保护简妮特 皮姆博士
If only you'd protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,960
别冲动  汉克
Easy, Hank.

30
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,120
你再敢提我妻子试试
You mention my wife again

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,060
我就让你见识下什么叫猛
and I'll show you ferocity.

32
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,970
别看我  话是你说的
Don't look at me. You said it.

33
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,270
我正实提出辞职
I formally tender my resignation.

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,750
我们拒绝接受  正式的
We don't accept it. Formally.

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,890
汉克
Hank,

36
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,420
我们需要你
we need you.

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,350
皮姆粒子是个奇迹  拜托了
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.

38
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,750
别让你的过去决定未来
Don't let your past determine the future.

39
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,400
只要我还活着
As long as I am alive,

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,150
谁都休想得到那个公式
nobody will ever get that formula.

41
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,960
我们不该让他离开这栋楼
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

42
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,850
你已经骗了他了
You've already lied to him.

43
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,170
现在还想跟他开战吗
Now you want to go to war with him?

44
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,150
是的
Yes.

45
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,190
我们的科学家想复制他的成果还差得远呢
Our scientists haven't come close to replicating his work.

46
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,090
他刚才已经着实地教训了你一顿
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,870
你真想体验下
You really want to find out

48
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,630
在你看都看不到他在哪时  他有多厉害吗
what it's like when you can't see him coming?

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,340
我认识汉克·皮姆很久了
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.

50
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,900
他不是安全隐患
He's no security risk.

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,520
除非我们把他逼到那步
Unless we make him one.

52
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,890
现在

53
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,690
喜欢吗
You like that?

54
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,040
喜欢吗
You like that?

55
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,820
放马过来吧
Come get you some now.

56
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,740
你连动都没动一下
You didn't even move.

57
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,120
是啊
Nah.

58
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,610
我要是打你左边呢  就下面这里
What if I come in on the left side, right? Just down here.

59
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,870
你看到这里了吗
You see this right here?

60
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,660
我会想你的  斯科特
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

61
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,260
我也会想你的  桃子
I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,490
你们这帮人的道别仪式真怪
Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals.

63
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,890
好了  散了吧
All right, break it up.

64
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,570
散了吧  散了吧
Break it up! Break it up!

65
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,840
圣昆廷监狱

66
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,160

Ha-ha! Hey, man.

70

你的眼睛怎么了
Hey, what's up with your eye?

71
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,530
你觉得呢
Oh. Well, what do you think?

72
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,230
桃子打的  临别赠礼
Peachy. It's a going-away present.

73
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,400
对哦  我去年留的疤还在呢
Oh, yeah. I still got my scar from a year ago.

74
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,910
可你知道吗
You know what?

75
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,710
我仍然是唯一一个把他打趴下的人
I'm still the only one who knocked him out.

76
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,800
我可没做到
Well, I definitely didn't.

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,970
谢谢你来接我  哥们
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

78
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,630
哥们  我的狱友出狱我能不来吗
Bro, you think I'm gonna miss my celly getting out?

79
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,000
你女朋友如何  哥们
Hey, how's your girl, man?

80

她把我甩了
Oh, she left me.

81
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,830
我妈也死了
Yeah, my ma died, too.

82
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,330

83
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,850

Thanks for the hook-up, too. I needed a place to stay.

86
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,540
当你看到沙发再说吧  
You wait till you see this couch.

87
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,770
你肯定会很高兴的
You're gonna be really happy.

88
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,320
你会很快站稳脚跟的  看着吧
You're gonna be on your feet in no time. Watch.

89
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,250
希望如此
I hope so.

90

我还要把你介绍给一些人

93
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,760
不  说真的  我不要再坐牢了
No, I'm serious, man. I'm not going back.

94

我还有个女儿要照顾
I got a daughter to take care of.

95
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,450
你知道有案底的人不好找工作吧
You know that jobs don't come easy for ex-cons, right?

96
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,690
哥们  我可是电气工程硕士好吧
Look, man, I got a master's in electrical engineering, all right?

97
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,460

118
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,180
没人肯雇我
No one would hire me.

119
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,660
非法闯入  重大盗窃罪
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.

120

121
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,570

I don't do it anymore. I just...

122

The more I read about what you did and stuff...

128
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,550
我越觉得"我居然认识这家伙
I'm like, "Wow, I know this guy?

129
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,330
他现在归我管"
I'm in charge of this guy?"

132

你当然是被炒了
Well, you're fired, of course.

133
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,490
我不能留着你
I can't really keep you on.

134
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,330
等一下  什么  炒了
Wait, what? Fired?

135
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,100
是的
Yeah.

136
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,590
戴尔  那不是暴力犯罪
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.

137
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,670
我是个好员工
I mean, I'm a good worker.

138
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,760
不  的确不是暴力犯罪  是酷炫型的
No, it wasn't a violent crime. It was a cool crime.

139
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,010
但我告诉你
I'll tell you what, though.

140
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,160
当然是私下的  不对外啊
This will be totally off the books, off the records,

141
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,200
如果你走的时候想拿上一杯
but if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts

142
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,580
芒果水果风暴的话
on your way out the door,

143
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,400
我会假装没看到
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

144
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,890
斯科蒂  怎么了
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

145
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,280
我还以为你在上班呢
I thought you were supposed to be at work.

146
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,170
刚被炒了
I was. I got fired.

147
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,630
该死的  他们查出你是谁了
Damn. They find out who you are?

148
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,840
芭斯罗缤总能查出来  哥们
Baskin-Robbins always finds out, bro.

149
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,720
芭斯罗缤可不是玩的
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

150
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,180
要吃华夫饼吗
You want some waffles?

151
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,040
好  给我来一个
Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

152
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,520
那位是科特
Oh. That's Kurt.

153
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,450
他在福尔松蹲了五年  他是电脑天才
He was Folsom for five years. He's a wizard on that laptop.

154
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,260
很高兴认识你
Nice meet you.

155
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,630
我也很高兴认识你
Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

156
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,520
你是谁
Who are you?

157
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,980
戴夫
Dave.

158
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,090
维斯塔那票干的不错

160
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,610
不  不  我听说过这个打劫
No, no. I have heard of this robbery.

161
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,120
严格来讲  我没有打劫他们  打劫包括恐吓
Well, technically, I didn't rob them. Robbery involves threat.

162
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,800
我讨厌暴力  我偷了他们  我是个飞贼
I hate violence. I burgled them. I'm a cat burglar.

163
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,140
你是说你是个怂货
You mean you're a pussy.

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,540
他们对顾客漫天要价
They were overcharging the customers, right?

165
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,130
总计得有上百万
And it added up to millions.

166
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,100
他揭发了这件事结果被炒了
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.

167
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,430
他接下来做了什么
And what does he do?

168
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,830
他黑进了安保系统
He hacks into the security system

169
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,790
把上百万美金
and transfers millions

170
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,460
转回给了那些被骗的人账上
back to the people that they stole it from.

171
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,540
还把所有的银行记录都放到了网上
Posts all the bank records online.

172
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,860
还把那家伙的宾利开进了他家泳池里
And he drove the dude's Bentley into his swimming pool.

173
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,450
你这是在干吗
What are you doing?

174
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,310
为什么把我的人生故事告诉这俩人
Why are you telling my life story to these guys?

175
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
你想干吗
What do you want?

176
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,980
好吧
Okay.

177
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,280
我表兄两周前跟一个人
My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago

178
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,800
聊到一票超完美的活
about this little perfect job.

179
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,730
不干
No way.

180
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,200
别别别  等一下  这个人
No, no, no. Wait! This guy...

181
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,040
正好是你不喜欢的那种
This guy fits your M.O.

182
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,950
不要
No!

183
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,510
我金盆洗手了  我不要再进监狱了
I'm finished, man. I'm not going back to jail.

184
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,790
是个拿着丰厚养老金退休的百万富翁
It's some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute.

185
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,870
这简直就是斯科特·朗的完美目标
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

186
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,770
我不在乎  我不干
I don't care. I'm out.

187
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,830
皮姆博士
Dr. Pym?

188
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,330
是的  我还活着
Yes. I'm still alive.

189
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,660
身份证明
ID?

190
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,630
有那个就够了吧
Perhaps that will suffice.

191
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,850
很抱歉  先生  请进
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

193
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,730
早上好  汉克
Good morning, Hank.

194
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,320
霍普
Hope.

195
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,590
叫我一声爸会死吗
Would it kill you to call me Dad?

196
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,070
你能抽空来见我们
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that

197
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,060
克洛斯博士会很开心的

198
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,140
简直是激动万分
More like "thrilled".

199
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,120
收到你发的邀请函
I was surprised to receive

200
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,740
我还真是意外呀  达伦

201
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,250
今天是什么大日子
What's the occasion?

202
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,730
你会知道的  对吧  霍普
Oh, you'll see. Won't he, Hope?

203
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,120
里面已经准备好了  就等你了
We're ready for you inside.

204
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,380
还是不理你呀
Ouch.

205
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,180
看来有些旧伤是无法痊愈的
I guess some old wounds never heal, huh?

206
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,810
别担心  我会照顾好她的
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

207
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,210
你这次是来看好戏的
You're in for a treat.

208
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,230
好久不见  皮姆博士  退休生活还好吗
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym. How's retirement?

209
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,020
你的脸还好吗
How's your face?

210
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,610
你先请
After you.

211
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,650
在我们开始前
Now, before we start,

212
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,280
我想先介绍一位非常特别的嘉宾
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

213
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,270
这个公司的创始人以及我的导师
This company's founder and my mentor,

214
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,730
汉克·皮姆博士
Dr. Hank Pym.

215
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,830
当我从皮姆博士手中接管了这家公司时
When I took over this company for Dr. Pym,

216
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,110
我便立刻开始研究一个
I immediately started researching a particle

217
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,040
可以改变分子间距离
that could change the distance between atoms,

218
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,260
并增加密度和力量的粒子
while increasing density and strength.

219
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,300
如此一个革命性的想法为何会
Why this revolutionary idea remained buried

220
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,220
一直被埋在汉克的众多研究中
beneath the dust and cobwebs of

221
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,140
积累尘土和蜘蛛网  我不得而知
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

222
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,140
但请想像一下
But just imagine,

223
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,860
一个昆虫大小的士兵
a soldier the size of an insect.

224
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,570
终极秘密武器
The ultimate secret weapon.

225
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,190
蚁人
An Ant-Man.

226
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,950
他们当初就是这么称呼你的  对吧  汉克
That's what they called you. Right, Hank?

227
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,990
有点傻  我知道
Silly, I know.

228
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,510
这只是宣传手段
Propaganda.

229
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,120
用来唬人的故事
Tales to astonish!

230
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,430
捏造出来吓唬苏联的故事
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

231
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,450
汉克  可以请你告诉来宾们
Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me

232
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,950
我每一次问你"蚁人真实存在吗"
every single time I asked you,

233
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,240
你是怎么回答我的
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

234
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,840
这只是个传说
Just a tall tale.

235
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,680
没错
Right.

236
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,620
因为如此不可思议的事
Because how could anything so miraculous

237
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,170
怎么可能是真的
possibly be real?

238
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,160
我受到蚁人传说的启发
Well, I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man.

239
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,970
有了我缩小无机物材料的突破性进展
And with my breakthrough shrinking inorganic material,

240
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,660
我就想  有没有可能把人也缩小呢
I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person?

241
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,320
这有可能做到吗
Could that be done?

242
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,490
这不再是个传说了
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

243
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,650
尊敬的来宾们
Distinguished guests,

244
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,840
我自豪地向你们展示现代战争的终结者

246
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,730

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,600
黄衫是全能的战争武器
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war

248
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,330
它可以改变穿着者的大小

249
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,720
能够轻松打赢战争

250
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,610
在我们现今生活的时代
We live in an era

251
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,010
我们用来保护自己的武器

252
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,750
受到持续监视的削弱

253
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,370
来回到简单的时代
It's time to return to a simpler age.

254
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,000
让人们可以公开地
One where the powers of freedom

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,770
使用自由的权利

256
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,670
来保卫自己的利益

一个全能型维和的机甲
An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,

258
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,480
黄衫可以悄无声息地

解决地缘政治中的

任何冲突

261
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,460
在预防手段和战术袭击中

均有奇效

00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,740
实际应用包括监视

264
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,380
工业破坏
industrial sabotage,

265
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,130
和清除和平道路上的一切障碍
and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace.

266
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,930
只需一件黄衫
A single Yellowjacket

267
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,080
使用者即可享有执行保护措施的

无限能力

269
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,420
在不久后的一天  一支穿着黄衫的军队
And, one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets

270
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,620

272
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,390
黄衫
The Yellowjacket.

273
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,530
所以这就是件衣服
So, it's a suit?

274
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,960
别说这么粗俗  弗兰克
Don't be crude, Frank.

275
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,890
这不是件衣服  而是个机甲
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

276
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,210
怎么了  这项发明没有打动你吗
What's the matter? You're not impressed?

277
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,340
不  让人印象深刻  但我也有顾虑
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

278
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,930
想像一下我们的敌人能用这项技术做什么
Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.

279
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,670
我们应该好好聊一下这个问题  弗兰克
We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank.

280
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,230
我很重视你的意见
I really value your opinion.

281
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,270
谢谢大家莅临  霍普
Thank you for coming. Hope?

282
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,540
非常感谢诸位  我现在将带大家离场
Thank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now.

283
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,540
谢谢
Thank you.

284
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,620
你好像有点震惊
You seem a bit shocked.

285
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,150
达伦  我尘封那些秘密是有原因的
Darren, there's a reason that I buried these secrets.

286
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,860
你终于承认了
So you finally admit it!

287
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,900
我们本可携手完成  汉克
We could have done this together, Hank.

288
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,350
但你却把机会毁了
But you ruined that.

289
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,830
所以你只停留在过去  我才是未来
That's why you're the past and I'm the future.

290
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,580
别这么做
Don't do this.

291
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,800
克洛斯博士
Dr. Cross?

292
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,450
你先卖给我  我出比你要价高20%的价格
You sell to me first, 20% over your asking price,

293
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,550
两周后我就可以付你现金
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

294
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,480
成交
Deal.

295
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,710
我们该行动了  汉克
We have to make our move, Hank.

296
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,360
他进展得怎么样了
How close is he?

297
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,510
他还没法缩小生物
He still can't shrink a live subject.

298
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,370
你就把衣服给我
Just give me the suit

299
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,250
我来永除后患
and let me finish this once and for all.

300
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,200
不行
No.

301
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,260
克洛斯完全信任我
I have Cross' complete trust.

302
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,140
太危险了
It's too dangerous.

303
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,940
我们别无选择
We don't have a choice.

304
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,140
也不尽然
Well, that's not entirely true.

305
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,720
我想我找到了合适的人选
I think I found a guy.

306
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,570
谁
Who?

307
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,440
爸爸
Daddy!

308
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,240
小花生
Peanut! Oh!

309
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,720
生日快乐
Happy birthday!

310
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,580
非常抱歉  我迟到了
I'm so sorry I'm late.

311
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,320
我不知道聚会几点开始
I didn't know what time your party started.

312
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,040
邀请上写了时间的
It was on the invitation.

313
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
他都没收到邀请
He didn't get an invitation.

314
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,330
可他还是来了
But he came anyway!

315
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,460
我不会错过宝贝女儿的生日聚会
Well, I'm not gonna miss my little girl's birthday party.

316
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,130
我去告诉妈妈你来了
I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.

317
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,070
别
Oh, you don't...

318
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,390
你来这儿干什么  郎
What are you doing here, Lang?

319
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,850
你没给过孩子一分钱的抚养费
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

320
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,680
现在  只要我乐意  就可以逮捕你
You know, right now, if I wanted to, I could arrest you.

321
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,930
好像我很愿意见你似的  帕克斯顿
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

322
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,390
你能来妈妈可高兴了  她喝水都呛着了
Mommy's so happy you're here, she choked on her drink.

323
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,920
看我给你带了什么
Hey, look what I have for you.

324
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,880
我能现在就打开吗
Can I open it now?

325
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,610
当然能  宝贝儿  今天是你的生日啊
Of course, sweetheart. It's your birthday.

326
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,030
你是我最最最好的朋友
You're my bestest friend.

327
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,050
那是什么玩意儿
What is that thing?

328
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,040
他好丑啊
He's so ugly!

329
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,940
我爱死他了
I love him!

330
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,050
我能拿给我朋友们看吗
Can I go show my friends?

331
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,000
当然能  宝贝儿  去吧
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

332
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,410
你是我最最最好的朋友
You're my bestest friend.

333
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,450
我会给孩子抚养费的
Look, the child support is coming, all right?

334
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,190
不过有了前科就很难找到工作
It's just hard finding a job when you have a record.

335
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,260
我相信你能想法解决
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

336
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:27,780
不过现在
But for now,

337
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,140
-我希望你离开我家  -不可能
- I want you out of my house. - No way!

338
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,080
这是我女儿的生日聚会
It's my daughter's birthday party.

339
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,360
-这是我家  -那又如何
- It's my house! - So what?

340
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,620
-她是我闺女  -斯科特
- It's my kid! - Scott!

341
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,010
你不能说来就来  你知道的  走吧
You can't just show up here. You know that. Come on.

342
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,030
这是生日聚会啊
It's a birthday party.

343
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,990
我知道  但你不能说来就来
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

344
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,790
她是我闺女
She's my daughter.

345
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,410
你根本就不懂怎么做父亲
You don't know the first thing about being a father.

346
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,980
玛姬  看在你是我初恋
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,

347
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,700
我们还是朋友的份上  我告诉你
and as the first love of my life.

348
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,490
你的未婚夫是个混袋
Your fiance is an asshat.

349
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,340
他不是混袋
He's not an asshat.

350
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,560
喂  嘴巴放干净点儿
Hey, watch your language. Okay?

351
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,610
哪里不干净了  我说的是袋
What language? I said "Hat."

352
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,620
别吵了
Stop it.

353
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,480
真的吗  玛姬  就他
Really, Maggie? That guy?

354
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,050
你可以嫁给任何你喜欢的人
Come on! You could marry anyone you want,

355
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,730
为什么偏要选个条子呢
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

356
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,290
至少他不是骗子
At least he's not a crook.

357
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,940
我在努力  我已经改过自新  洗手不干了
I'm trying, okay? I've changed. I'm straight.

358
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,330
我找了份工作
I had a job and...

359
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,730
我想付抚养费
I wanna provide.

360
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,640
我花了很多时间思考  现在我明白了
I had a lot of time to think about it and I love her.

361
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,380
我非常爱她
So much.

362
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,680
我错过了太多
I've missed so much time

363
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,310
我想成为她生活的一部分
and I wanna be a part of her life.

364
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,540
我该怎么做
What do I do?

365
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,070
租套公寓
Get an apartment,

366
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,210
找份工作  付抚养费
get a job, pay child support.

367
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,180
然后我们再讨论探视孩子的问题
And then we will talk about visitation, I promise.

368
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,440
你是她的英雄  斯科特
You're her hero, Scott.

369
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,120
成为她心目中的那个人吧
Just be the person that she already thinks you are.

370
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,490
弗兰克  很遗憾
I'm sorry you have such

371
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,820
你对黄衫深表担忧
deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

372
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,970
是啊
Yeah. Well, uh...

373
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,490
很不幸  我们不能为所欲为
Unfortunately, we can't just do whatever we want.

374
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,190
那样就好了
It'd be nice though, right?

375
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,090
但是得遵守法则
But there are laws.

376
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,650
什么法则  人的吗
What laws? Of man?

377
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,320
自然法则高于人的法则
The laws of nature transcend the laws of man.

378
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,430
而我要高于自然法则
And I have transcended the laws of nature.

379
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,720
达伦  我觉得你不懂
Darren, I don't think you understand...

380
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,060
我们还没解决所有问题
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

381
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,760
永别了  弗兰克
Goodbye, Frank.

382
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,630
谢谢
Thank you.

383
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,750
我最近一直在想感恩这事
You know, I've been thinking a lot about gratitude lately.

384
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,340
今天早上  我在冥想的时候
And today, during my morning meditation,

385
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,880
得出了一个有意思的结论
an interesting thought occurred to me,

386
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,610
我觉得也适用于你
and I think it might apply to you, too.

387
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,480
什么结论
How's that?

388
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,390
感恩可以是原谅
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

389
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,560
我有好几年都活在对汉克·皮姆的愤恨中
I've spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym.

390
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,200
我把我的才华都奉献给了他
I devoted my genius to him.

391
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,960
我本来可以去任何地方工作
I could have worked anywhere.

392
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,590
我没选好导师
I chose my mentor poorly.

393
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,090
而你甚至别无选择
You didn't even have a choice.

394
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,380
他根本就不相信你
He never believed in you.

395
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,810
之前赶你走真是不好
It's a shame what we had to do,

396
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,960
可这都是被他逼的  对不对
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

397
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,820
但我们不该生气  我们应该感恩
But we shouldn't be angry, we should be grateful.

398
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,530
因为作为失败的导师
Because his failures as a mentor,

399
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,330
失败的父亲
as a father,

400
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,920
是他逼我们一展鸿图
forced us to spread our wings.

401
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,870
达伦  你成功了
You're a success, Darren.

402
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,660
你能获得的一切都当之无愧
You deserve everything coming your way.

403
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,310
再过377天才能见到凯西

404
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,230
别作弊了
Stop cheating.

405
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,680
回来啦  能人
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

406
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,840
他可能没听见你说话
Maybe he didn't hear you.

407
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,640
生日聚会怎么样
How was the party?

408
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,430
跟我说说那个活
Tell me about that tip.

409
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,550
什么
What?

410
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,770
我想知道你说的那个活
I wanna know about that tip.

411
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,300
宝贝儿  开工了  现在就行动
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.

412
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,000
别激动  我就想知道消息的来源
Calm down, all right? I just need to know where it came from.

413
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,500
要绝对可靠才行
It's gotta be airtight.

414
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,880
好
Okay.

415
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,540
我和表兄欧内斯托一起参加一场品酒会
I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto.

416
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,530
当时大部分是红酒
Which was mainly reds,

417
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,860
你知道我不喜欢红酒
and you know I don't like reds, man.

418
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,050
但有种玫瑰葡萄酒扭转了局面
But there was a rose that saved the day.

419
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,090
那天我们很愉快
It was delightful.

420
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,440
他跟我聊起一个姑娘
And then he tells me about this girl,

421
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,920
艾米丽  她以前经常跟我们鬼混
Emily, that we used to kick it with.

422
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,190
其实那是我摸过的第一对奶
It was actually the first pair of boobs I ever touched.

423
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,050
你扯远了
It's the wrong details.

424
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,690
这跟你要讲的事毫无瓜葛
It has nothing to do with the story.

425
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,670
重讲
Go.

426
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,280
他告诉我她现在有份工作
So, uh, he tells me that she's

427
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,090
是帮别人打扫卫生
working as a housekeeper now, right?

428
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,460
她在跟一个叫卡洛斯的家伙约会
And she's dating this dude, Carlos,

429
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,420
他是海湾那头的一个大佬
who's a shot caller from across the bay.

430
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,620
她把她雇主的情况告诉了他
And she tells him about the dude that she's cleaning for.

431
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,080
他雇主是个很牛的执行总裁
Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO

432
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,230
已经金盆洗手  但是超级有钱
that is all retired now, but he's loaded.

433
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,180
卡洛斯和欧内斯托在同一个垒球队
And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team,

434
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,730
他们有天开始聊天
and they get to talking, right?

435
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,350
好戏来了  卡洛斯说  "伙计
And here comes the good part. Carlos says, "Yo, man.

436
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,180
"有个人有个超大的保险柜
"This guy's got a big-ass safe just

437
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,400
"就放在地下室  就放在那"
"Sitting in the basement, just chilling."

438
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,440
欧内斯托当然就来找了我
Of course Ernesto comes to me because

439
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,500
因为他知道我盗窃技能了得
he knows I got mad thieving skills.

440
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,810
当然  我问了他
Of course, I ask him...

441
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,600
艾米丽告诉卡洛斯告诉你
"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you

442
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,310
告诉我那是个什么样的保险柜了吗
"To get to me what kind of safe it was?"

443
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,760
他说  没有
And he says, "Nah, dawg.

444
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,020
她只说保险柜超赞
"All she said is that it's super-legit

445
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,410
装在里面的肯定是好东西
"And whatever's in it, it's gotta be good."

446
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,310
什么
What?

447
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,080
老头有个保险柜
Old man have safe.

448
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,870
而且他这一周不在家
And he's gone for a week.

449
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,200
好吧  有个老头  他有个保险柜
All right. There's an old man, he's got a safe,

450
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,280
而且有一周不在家
and he's gone for a week.

451
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,520
就按这个来计划
Let's just work with that.

452
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,720
我说什么来着
You know what I'm saying?

453
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,750
座机线剪了  手机信号阻断
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.

454
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,220
今晚没人会打求救电话
No one will be making for distress call tonight.

455
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,190
通信检查
Comm check.

456
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,610
-收到  -收到
- Check. - Check.

457
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,940
要是出了状况  还有我呢
Hey, if the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?

458
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,950
别担心
Don't worry.

459
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,440
不会出状况的
It's not gonna happen.

460
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,510
我就喜欢他自负的样子
I love it when he gets cocky.

461
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,700
厉害
Damn!

462
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,780
警报解除了
Alarm is dead.

463
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,840
漂亮
Nice.

464
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,610
好了  我进到房子里了
All right, I'm moving through the house.

465
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,630
大力士设备

466
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,530
门上是个指纹锁
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.

467
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,170
什么  欧内斯托没告诉我这个啊
It's got what? Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

468
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,830
我们是不是完蛋了
Aw, man, are we screwed?

469
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,570
并不会
Not necessarily.

470
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,360
我进去了
I'm in.

471
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,790
没有触发警报  身手不错啊
No alarms have been triggered. He's in like the Flynn.

472
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,510
天哪
Oh, man.

473
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,450
怎么了
What is it?

474
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,750
他们没开玩笑  这个保险柜相当保险
Well, they weren't kidding. This safe is serious.

475
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,930
有多保险  斯科蒂
How serious are we talking, Scotty?

476
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,860
保险柜品牌
是卡本代尔牌的
It's a Carbondale.

477
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,650
1910年造
It's from 1910.

478
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,480
用的跟泰坦尼克号一样的钢材
Made from the same steel as the Titanic.

479
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,860
你能打开吗
Can you crack it?

480
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,690
关键在于  这种钢不怎么耐寒
Well, here's the thing. It doesn't do so well in the cold.

481
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,210
还记得那座冰山吗
Remember what that iceberg did?

482
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,800
记得  坑死了小李子
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

483
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,070
一船人都死了
Killed everybody.

484
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,690
老太太没死
Did not kill the old lady.

485
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,070
她还把宝石扔进海里了
She still throw the jewel into the oceans.

486
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,120
你在干什么
What are you doing?

487
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,130
我把水倒进锁眼里
I poured water in the

488
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,800
用氮把水冻上
locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen.

489
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,150
冰会膨胀  而金属不会
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

490
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,760
-你现在在干什么  -等待
- What are you doing now? - Waiting.

491
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,340
等待
Waiting.

492
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,450
漂亮
Nice.

493
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,450
里面是什么  现金吗  珠宝吗
What is it? Cash? Jewels?

494
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,800
-什么也没有  -你说什么
- There's nothing here. - What did you say?

495
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,120
-是套衣服  -什么
- It's a suit. - What?

496
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,930
一套旧机车皮衣
It's an old motorcycle suit.

497
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,540
没有现金  没有珠宝  什么也没有
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?

498
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,390
没有
No.

499
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,080
白忙活一场
It's a bust.

500
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,880
非常抱歉  斯科蒂
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

501
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,200
我知道你需要这票活
I know you needed to score.

502
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,890
我以为我们是用老鼠
I thought we were using mice.

503
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,360
有区别吗
What's the difference?

504
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,960
开始实验34-C  有机物原子缩小实验
Commence Experiment 34-C. Organic atomic reduction.

505
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,620
达伦  也许我们该考虑
Darren, maybe we should think...

506
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,110
缩小有机物组织是这项技术的核心
Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology.

507
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,530
我不能带着半成品去见买家
I can't go to the buyers with half a breakthrough.

508
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,150

Experiment 34-C results,

509

00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,750
消毒工作台  带实验对象35-C来
Sanitize the work station. Bring in subject 35-C.

511
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,780
为什么把这个锁起来
Why would you lock this up?

512
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,330
这太奇怪了
This is so weird.

513
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,920
斯科蒂  在吗
Scotty, what's up, man?

514
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,770
不知道这是什么呢
I wonder... What is this?

515
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,890
从这下面看上去
The world sure seems different

516
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,930
世界还真不一样  是不是  斯科特
from down here, doesn't it, Scott?

517
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,240
什么  谁在说话
What? Who said that?

518
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,620
路易斯  我在下面
Luis, down here!

519
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,040
这是火的试炼  斯科特
It's a trial by fire, Scott. Or, in this case,

520
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,470
或者现在是放水
water.

521
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,500
你比自己想象的要坚强
Guess you're tougher than you thought.

522
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,230
我不想看这个
Oh, I don't want to see this!

523
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
路易斯
Luis!

524
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,100
奶奶的...
Son of a...

525
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,710
积尘袋已满

526
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,290
什么情况
What the hell?

527
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,620
对试驾来说不错了
Not bad for a test drive.

528
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,170
留着衣服  我会联系你的
Keep the suit. I'll be in touch.

529
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,500
不  不  不  谢谢了
No! No! No, thank you!

530
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,490
趴在地上
Get down on the ground!

531
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,650
你被捕了
You are under arrest!

532
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,770
我没偷东西
No, I didn't steal anything!

533
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,410
我刚把偷的东西还回去了
I was returning something I stole.

534
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,460
别动
Don't move.

535
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,140
我们都快相信
You know, you almost had us convinced

536
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,700
你真的改过自新了
that you were gonna change your ways.

537
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,540
她们都很看好你
They were really rooting for you.

538
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,510
这会伤透她们的心
It's gonna break their hearts.

539
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
你有访客
You got a visitor.

540
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,160
谁
Who?

541
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,390
你的律师
Your lawyer.

542
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,230
我的律师
My lawyer?

543
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,680
我说过我会联系你的  斯科特
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

544
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,050
我开始觉得
I'm starting to think

545
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,710
你更愿意待在牢房里了
that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

546
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,790
天哪
Oh, man.

547
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,910
坐下
Sit down.

548
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,610
先生  对不起  我偷了衣服
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

549
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,590
我根本不想知道你为什么有这个
I don't even wanna know why you have it.

550
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,390
玛姬没看错你
Maggie was right about you.

551
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,770
你怎么知道
How do you know about...

552
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,120
怪不得她不让你接近凯西
No wonder she's trying to keep you away from Cassie.

553
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,430
世事开始变艰难的时候
The moment things get hard,

554
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,080
你就会回去犯罪
you turn right back to crime.

555
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,230
在我看来  你有一个选择
The way I see it, you have a choice.

556
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:34,370
要么在监狱里度过余生
You can either spend the rest of your life in prison,

557
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,660
要么回到你的牢房
or go back to your cell

558
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,620
等待进一步的指示
and await further instructions.

559
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,640
我不明白
I don't understand.

560
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,410
我也不指望你能明白
No, I don't expect you to.

561
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,580
但你现在没什么选择的余地
But you don't have many options right now,

562
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,040
坦白讲  我也没有
and quite frankly, neither do I.

563
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,110
你觉得当初
Why do you think

564
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,120
我为什么要让你偷那套衣服呢
I let you steal that suit in the first place?

565
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,190
什么
What?

566
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,780
第二次机会可是很难得啊
Second chances don't come around all that much.

567
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,920
所以下次你要是觉得看到了机会
So, next time you think you might see one,

568
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,320
我建议你仔细看看
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

569
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,510
你是我最最最好的朋友
You're my bestest friend!

570
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,910
你真的不想要别的玩具吗
Are you sure you don't want a different toy?

571
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,680
不  我喜欢这个
No, I love this one.

572
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:37,510
好吧  睡觉吧  我爱你
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

573
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,700
妈妈
Mommy?

574
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,150
爸爸是坏人吗
Is Daddy a bad man?

575
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,430
我听有些大人说他是坏人
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

576
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,840
不是
No.

577
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,940
爸爸有时只是有些迷茫
Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?

578
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,690
明智之选  你总算听进去了一回
Smart choice. You actually listened, for once.

579
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,650
从门下走
Under the door.

580
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,190
好吧  现在去哪里
Okay, where to now?

581
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,620
-稳住 -天呐
- Hang tight. - Oh, God.

582
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,120
什么  什么
What, what?

583
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,160
他跑哪儿去了
Where the hell did he go?

584
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,550
我不知道  他就那么消失了
I have no idea. He just vanished.

585
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,490
封锁周边五个街区  马上
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

586
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,900
退后  退后  退后
Get back! Get back! Get back!

587
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,780
-斯科特  这些是我的同伴  -什么
- Scott, these are my associates.  - What?

588
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,790
那只蚂蚁身上是背了个相机吗
Is that a camera on an ant?

589
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,170
是啊  当然了  为什么不呢
Yeah, sure. Why not?

590
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,480
车在哪
Where's the car?

591
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,140
没有车  我们用飞的
No car. We've got wings.

592
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,160
到达
Incoming!

593
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,200
把脚放在中心节点上  然后扶住胸腔
Put your foot on the central node and mount the thorax.

594
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,740
你在逗我吗
Are you Kidding?

595
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,240
-这东西安不安...  -你他妈快上去  斯科特
- How safe is... - Just get on the damn ant, Scott!

596
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,130
我为什么在一辆警车上
Why am I on a police car?

597
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,020
我难道不是不应该在警车上吗
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

598
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,070
这样你就可以搭个顺风车
So they can give you a lift

599
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,930
通过他们五个街区的封锁
past their five-block perimeter.

600
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,430
好吧  下一步怎么办
All right. Now, what's the next move?

601
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,620
抓紧了
Hang on tight.

602
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,430
这个容易  我找到窍门了
Oh, this is easy! I'm getting the hang of this.

603
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,080
往上拉就能向上飞  就像骑马一样
Yank up to go up. It's like a horse.

604
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,030
你要让247失去平衡了
You're throwing 247 off balance.

605
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,500
等等  他的名字叫247吗
Wait, his name is 247?

606
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,450
他没有名字  只有编号  斯科特
He doesn't have a name, he has a number, Scott.

607
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,180
你知道一共有多少只蚂蚁吗
Do you have any idea how many ants there are?

608
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,650
也许它是...也许它是248
Maybe it's... maybe it's 248.

609
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,290
不不不不  要晕了  要晕了
No, no, no, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

610
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,330
不  我觉得它是247
No, I think it's 247.

611
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:13,830
等等
Wait.

612
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,290
抓紧了
Hang on tight!

613
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,200
我觉得我逐渐掌握窍门了
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

614
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,340
是我在控制247  他并非听命于你
I am controlling 247. He is not listening to you.

615
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,320
什么
What?

616
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,400
-我能提个小小的要求吗  -不能
- Can I make one little request? - No.

617
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,710
停下来  247  打住  打住
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

618
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,650
不玩了
Time out.

619
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,530
斯科维亚事件该怪谁

620
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,190
好了  等一下
All right, hold on.

621
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,760
等等
Just wait!

622
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,420
假如我吐在了头盔里会发生什么
What happens if I throw up in this helmet?

623
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,550
这是我的头盔  斯科特  别吐里面
It's my helmet, Scott. You do not throw up.

624
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,100
让她停下来吧  好不好
Let's set her down, all right?

625
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,260
我头有点晕了
I'm getting light-headed.

626
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,510
坚持住  斯科特
Hang on, Scott.

627
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,790
我有点...
I'm getting a little...

628
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,430
不能睡过头
I need a snooze button.

629
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,530
5分钟后叫醒我
Hit me in 5 minutes.

630
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,550
你好
Hello.

631
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,320
你是谁
Who are you?

632
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,920
你就一直在那站着
Have you been standing there,

633
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,640
看我睡觉吗
watching me sleep, this whole time?

634
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,700
没错
Yes.

635
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,880
为什么
Why?

636
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,070
因为你上次来时  是来偷东西的
Because the last time you were here, you stole something.

637
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,550
听着...
Hey, look...

638
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,140
拟猛蚁亚科子弹蚁
Paraponera clavata.

639
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,660
巨型热带子弹蚂蚁
Giant tropical bullet ants,

640
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,390
昆虫蛰伤痛度的排名
施密特疼痛指数排第一
ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index.

641
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,250
我不在时就由它们在这盯着你
They're here to keep an eye on you when I can't.

642
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,600
皮姆博士在楼下等着你呢
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

643
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,460
谁
Who?

644
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,460
这是谁的睡衣
Whose pajamas are these?

645
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,020
这要怎么走过去啊
How am I supposed to do this?

646
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,900
好吧  一步一步来
All right, just one step at a time.

647
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,660
你们不咬我  我就不踩你们  成交吗
You don't bite me, I don't step on you. Deal?

648
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,440
我可以破坏掉服务器
I could take down the servers

649
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,750
克洛斯不会发现的
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

650
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,270
我们不需要这个人
We don't need this guy.

651
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,910
我猜你已经见过我女儿霍普了
I assume that you've already met my daughter, Hope.

652
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:33,070
见过了  她真好
I did. She's great.

653
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,340
她不认为我们需要你
She doesn't think that we need you.

654
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,340
我们是不需要  我们自己就能搞定
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

655
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,250
我费劲千方百计让你偷了我的装备
I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit,

656
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,030
然后霍普就害你被捕了
and then Hope has you arrested.

657
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,070
好吧  我们可以试试
Okay, we can try this

658
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,150
一旦他失败了  我就自己上
and when he fails, I'll do it myself.

659
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,250
她有点焦虑
She's a little bit anxious.

660
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,870
和这次的活儿有关
It has to do with this job,

661
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,430
鉴于你现在坐在我对面的这个事实
which, judging by the fact that you're sitting opposite me,

662
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,880
我姑且认为你是感兴趣的
I take it that you're interested in.

663
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,760
什么活
What job?

664
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,190
要喝茶吗
Would you like some tea?

665
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,870
好啊
Sure.

666
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,070
我很佩服
I was very impressed with

667
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,280
你通过我的安保系统的方式
how you managed to get past my security system.

668
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,240
冰冻金属那招尤其聪明
Freezing that metal was particularly clever.

669
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,690
你当时在看着我吗
Were you watching me?

670
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,490
斯科特  我看着你有一会儿了
Scott, I've been watching you for a while.

671
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,630
从你抢了维斯塔公司开始
Ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

672
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,570
维斯塔公司前任员
牵扯进手法精妙的盗窃案

673
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,850
抱歉
Excuse me.

674
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,130
"偷了"维斯塔公司
"Burgled" Vista Corp.

675
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,070
维斯塔的安保系统
Vista's security system was one of

676
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,170
是业内最先进的
the most advanced in the business.

677
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,470
它本应该是无法攻破的
It was supposed to be unbeatable.

678
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,720
但是你攻破了
But you beat it.

679
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,630
要加糖吗
Would you like some sugar?

680
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,810
要  谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

681
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,360
你猜怎么着  还是不要了
You know what? I'm okay.

682
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,130
你是怎么让它们做到那个的
How do you make them do that?

683
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,340
蚂蚁能搬动自身重量50倍的物体
Ants can lift objects 50 times their weight.

684
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,860
它们建造  耕作  相互合作
They build, farm, they cooperate with each other.

685
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,270
好吧  但是你是怎么让它们做到那个的
Right. But how do you make them do that?

686
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,220
我用电磁波
I use electromagnetic waves

687
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:01,680
来刺激它们的嗅觉神经中枢
to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

688
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,810
我对它们说话
I speak to them.

689
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,380
我想去哪里都可以  我可以听见一切
I can go anywhere, hear anything,

690
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,960
看见一切
and see everything.

691
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,090
但你依然一无所知
And still know absolutely nothing.

692
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:13,020
我和克洛斯的见面要迟到了
I'm late to meet Cross.

693
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,160
皮姆博士
Dr. Pym?

694
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,290
你没必要举手  斯科特
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

695
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,580
抱歉  我就一个问题
Sorry, I just have one question.

696
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,660
你是说  她是谁  这他妈发生什么事了
Who are you, who is she, what the hell's going on,

697
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,310
我现在能回监狱吗
and can I go back to jail now?

698
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:28,760
和我来
Come with me.

699
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,490
40年前  我创造了一个公式
40 years ago, I created a formula

700
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,860
能改变原子间的相对距离
that altered atomic relative distance.

701
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,650
什么
Huh?

702
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,560
我得知了如何改变原子间的距离
I learned how to change the distance between atoms.

703
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,190
那就是那件衣服的动力
That's what powers the suit.

704
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,730
它运作的原理
That's why it works.

705
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,440
但这是很危险的
But it was dangerous.

706
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,520
过于危险了
It was too dangerous.

707
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,790
所以我将它藏起来了
So I hid it from the world.

708
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,470
从那时我便另起炉灶  开了自己的公司
And that's when I switched gears and I started my own company.

709
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:01,870
皮姆科技
Pym Tech.

710
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:02,750
没错
Yes.

711
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,570
我收了个年轻的学徒  名叫达伦·克洛斯
I took on a young protege called Darren Cross.

712
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,060
达伦·克洛斯
Darren Cross.

713
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,250
他可是个大人物啊
He's a big deal.

714
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,890
但在他成为大人物之前  他是我的助手
But before he was a big deal, he was my assistant.

715
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,850
我觉得自己看中了他的某些特质
I thought I saw something in him.

716
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,900
甚至把他当自己儿子了吧
The son I never had, perhaps.

717
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,510
他很有才华  但当我们关系越来越近时
He was brilliant, but as we became close,

718
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,850
他开始怀疑我有事没告诉他
he began to suspect that I wasn't telling him everything.

719
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,220
他听到了关于皮姆微粒的传言
He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particle,

720
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,270
从此开始着了魔般地想重现我的公式
and he became obsessed with recreating my formula.

721
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,840
但我不愿意帮他
But I wouldn't help him.

722
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,340
所以他背叛了我
So he conspired against me

723
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,960
投票把我赶出了我自己的公司
and he voted me out of my own company.

724
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,310
他是怎么做到的
How could he do that?

725
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,290
董事会的主席是我的女儿  霍普
The board's chairman is my daughter, Hope.

726
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,990
她投了决定性的一票
She was the deciding vote.

727
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,830
但当她看到克洛斯差不多就要
But she came back to me

728
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,830
重现我的公式时  她回到了我身边
when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula.

729
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,040
这整个过程非常的不稳定
The process is highly volatile.

730
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,240
假如没戴着特制的头盔
If one isn't protected by a specialized helmet,

731
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,320
有可能会影响到大脑的作用
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

732
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,360
我不认为达伦知道这一点
I don't think Darren realizes this,

733
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,690
再说了  他自己也没有多稳定
and, you know, he's not the most stable guy to begin with.

734
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,570
所以  你想要我做什么
So, what do you want from me?

735
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,580
斯科特  我相信人人都该有赎罪的机会
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption.

736
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,550
你相信吗
Do you?

737
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,690
相信
I do.

738
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,090
假如你能帮我的话
If you can help me,

739
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,950
我保证能帮你重新回到你女儿身边
I promise I can help you be with your daughter again.

740
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,430
现在  你准备好自我救赎了吗
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

741
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,030
百分百好了
Absolutely.

742
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,670
我那些入室盗窃的日子一去不复返了
My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done.

743
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,290
您要我做什么
What do you want me to do?

744
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,910
我要你入室并且盗窃
I want you to break into a place and steal some shit.

745
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,780
你今晚回家吃晚饭吗
Are you gonna be home for dinner tonight?

746
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,860
郎的"律师"
是汉克·皮姆博士
皮姆科技的

747
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,380
回的  我得去拿些东西  发短信给我
Uh, yeah. I'll pick something up. Text me.

748
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,180
好吧  是好消息吗
Okay. Good news?

749
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,610
我不知道  就是个消息
Uh... I don't know. It's news.

750
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,570
你是在试图找到我爸爸吗
Are you trying to find my daddy?

751
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,600
是的  甜心
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

752
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,440
我只是想确保你爸爸的安全
I just want your daddy to be safe.

753
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,460
希望你抓不到他
Hope you don't catch him.

754
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,440
这不是第一次这些人
This isn't the first time these guys

755
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,580
试图染指能改变世界格局的武器了
have tried to get their hands on game-changing weaponry.

756
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,090
那是米切尔·卡森  神盾局前任防御部长
That's Mitchell Carson, Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

757
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,140
如今正赶着颠覆政府的勾当
Presently in the business of toppling governments.

758
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,480
他一直想要我的技术
He always wanted my tech.

759
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,840
除非我们能闯进去偷了黄衫
And now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket

760
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,900
并且毁掉所有数据
and destroy all the data,

761
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:10,300
否则达伦·克洛斯就要掀起世界动乱了
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.

762
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:17,330
我觉得首先我们应该去向复仇者们求助
I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.

763
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,500
我花了大半辈子
I spent half my life

764
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,730
努力不让这项科技落入斯塔克手中
trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark.

765
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,120
我现在也绝不会亲手把它交过去
I'm sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now.

766
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:30,660
这可不是钢铁侠战衣那种小儿科
This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit.

767
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,920
这个能改变现实的结构
This could change the texture of reality.

768
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,600
影射复联2剧情
再说了  他们八成正忙着把城市从天上往下扔呢
Besides, they're probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.

769
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,410
好吧  那你为何不直接派蚂蚁去呢
Okay, then why don't you just send the ants?

770
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,790
斯科特  它们只是蚂蚁
Scott, they are ants.

771
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,190
蚂蚁  它们能做很多事
Ants, they can do a lot of things,

772
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:49,440
但它们依然需要个领头的
but they still need a leader.

773
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,010
需要某人能渗透进
Somebody that could infiltrate a place

774
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,890
某个被设计成无法渗透的地方
that's designed to prevent infiltration.

775
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,740
汉克  我是个贼  明白吗
Hank, I'm a thief, all right?

776
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,530
我是说  我是个很厉害的贼
I mean, i'm a good thief,

777
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,650
但这个也太疯狂了
but this is insane.

778
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,490
他说得对  汉克  你自己也清楚
He's right, Hank. And you know it.

779
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,850
你见过影像画面了
You've seen the footage,

780
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,900
你知道克洛斯能干出些什么来
you know what Cross is capable of.

781
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,930
我几个月前就反对用他
I was against using him when we had months,

782
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:07,580
而如今我们只有几天了
and now we have days.

783
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,760
我来穿那套衣服
I'm wearing the suit.

784
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,240
绝对不行
Absolutely not!

785
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,090
我了解那栋建筑的里里外外
I know the facility inside and out.

786
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,300
我了解克洛斯的想法
I know how Cross thinks.

787
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,010
我比任何人都了解这项任务
I know this mission better than anybody here.

788
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:16,010
我们需要你待在克洛斯身边
We need you close to Cross.

789
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,550
不然的话  这项任务没办法成功的
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

790
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,270
我们没时间胡闹了
We don't have time to screw around!

791
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,190
霍普  拜托听我说...
Hope, please listen to me...

792
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,800
他是个罪犯  我是你女儿
He is a criminal! I'm your daughter.

793
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,770
不行
No!

794
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,760
她说得对  汉克
She's right, Hank.

795
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:04,600
我不是你要找的人
I'm not your guy.

796
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,960
你为什么不自己穿呢
Why don't you wear the suit?

797
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,850
你以为我不想吗
You think I don't want to?

798
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,560
我是不能穿
I can't.

799
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,780
我穿过好几年
I spent years wearing it,

800
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,440
而这衣服对我产生了不良影响
and it took a toll on me.

801
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:27,010
你是唯一的人选
You're our only option.

802
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,870
在霍普失去她母亲前
Before Hope lost her mother,

803
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,870
她曾经视我为世界上最伟大的人
she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world.

804
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,250
而如今她看着我  眼中只剩下失望
And now she looks at me and there's just disappointment.

805
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,860
对我而言已经太迟了
It's too late for me,

806
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,900
但你不一样
but not for you.

807
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,410
这是你的机会
This is your chance.

808
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,250
重新赢得你女儿眼中的崇拜的机会
The chance to earn that look in your daughter's eyes.

809
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:02,080
不要辜负你在她心中的英雄形象
To become the hero that she already thinks you are.

810
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,960
这无关拯救我们的世界
It's not about saving our world.

811
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:08,520
而是事关拯救她们的
It's about saving theirs.

812
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:13,570
靠  这番话说得真好
Damn. That was a good speech.

813
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,510
斯科特
Scott,

814
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:19,830
我需要你成为蚁人
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

815
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,620
正确地使用它
In the right hands,

816
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,960
人和衣服之间就会是一种共生关系
the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic.

817
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,680
衣服有力量  人则是利用那种力量
The suit has power. The man harnesses that power.

818
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,600
你需要变得灵巧  敏捷  最重要的是
You need to be skillful, agile, and above all,

819
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,040
你得要快
you need to be fast.

820
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,320
你要能够在极短的时间内缩小
You should be able to shrink and grow

821
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:39,380
和变大
on a dime.

822
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,900
让你的体型总能配合你的行动
So your size always suits your needs.

823
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,710
现在  穿过那个钥匙孔  斯科特
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

824
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:48,080
你起跑时是大的
You charge big,

825
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,170
然后变小穿过
you dive small,

826
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,780
之后再变大
then you emerge big.

827
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,530
废物
Useless.

828
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,050
当你变小时  力量就被压缩了
When you're small, energy's compressed,

829
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,880
所以你180斤的男性的力量
so you have the force of a 200-pound man

830
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,200
放在了0.25毫米大的拳头后
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.

831
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,460
你就像是一颗子弹

832
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,080
你出拳太重了  会把人杀死

833
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,980

这样出拳才对
That's how you punch.

841

她一直等着这个呢

847
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,450
你能不能别再重复那个谎言了
Could you please stop telling me that lie?

848
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:38,620
我们在干正事呢

意思是你会进入一个量子界

都没有意义了
become irrelevant

861
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:16,270
因为你会不断缩小

862
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,870
你所知和所爱的一切

你知道他让你冒了多大的风险

你有个女儿

933
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:36,810
我做这些也是为了她

我妈妈去世时  我两周没见到他人
You know, when my mother died, I didn't see him for two weeks.

935
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,520
他肯定很伤心
He was in grief.

936
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,060
我也是  我当时才七岁
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

937
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,660
然后他再也没回来  没有真正回来
And he never came back. Not in any way that counted.

938
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:48,370
他直接把我送到寄宿学校
He just sent me off to boarding school.

939
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,190
要知道  我以为
You know, I thought,

940
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,180
这次危机
with all that's at stake,

941
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,150
可能是我们重归于好的机会
just maybe we might have a chance of making peace.

942
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,600
可事到如今他还是对我拒之千里
But, even now, he still wants to shut me out.

943
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,280
他不是想拒绝你  他信任你
He doesn't wanna shut you out. He trusts you.

944
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,740
那要你来干什么
Then why are you here?

945
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,650
来证明他爱你
It proves that he loves you.

946
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,630
霍普  看着我
Hope. Look at me.

947
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:11,190
我是来当炮灰的
I'm expendable.

948
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:13,340
找我就是为了这个
That's why I'm here.

949
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,630
你现在应该也意识到了
You must have realized that by now.

950
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:19,630
这就是为什么是我穿那套衣服而不是你
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit and you're not.

951
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,720
他宁愿全盘皆输也不愿意失去你
He would rather lose this fight than lose you.

952
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:26,740
所以说
Anyway...

953
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,880
我打电话报警的时候
You know, I didn't know you had a daughter

954
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:33,710
不知道你有个女儿
when I called the cops on you.

955
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,660
她叫什么
What's her name?

956
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,590
凯西
Cassie.

957
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:42,910
很美的名字
It's a pretty name.

958
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,170
你得整理思绪  斯科特

959
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:49,880
想法一定要明确
You have to make your thoughts precise.

960
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,160
这就是其中原理
That's how it works.

961
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,510
想想凯西
Think about Cassie.

962
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:57,940
想想你有多想见她  靠这个集中精力

睁开眼睛
Open your eyes

964
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:11,780
想想你想要蚂蚁们怎么做
and just think about what you want the ants to do.

965
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,170
做得好
That's good!

966
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,990
你母亲说服我
Your mother convinced me

967
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:59,150
让她也加入我的任务
to let her join me on my missions.

968
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:02,120
他们叫她黄蜂女
They called her the Wasp.

969
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:04,230
她手到擒来
She was born to it.

970
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,620
之后没有哪一天
And there's not a day that goes by

971
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,070
我不在后悔当初答应了她
that I don't regret having said yes.

972
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:18,150
那是1987年
It was 1987.

973
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,420
分裂派在苏联库斯科劫持了一个导弹发射井
Separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

974
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:28,000
并向美国发射了一枚洲际导弹
and launched an ICBM at the United States.

975
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:37,990
进入导弹内部的唯一方式
The only way to the internal mechanics

976
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,740
就是穿过固态钛
was through solid titanium.

977
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:51,100
我知道我得缩小到
I knew I had to shrink

978
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,340
比分子还小  才能解除导弹
between the molecules to disarm the missile.

979
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:58,300
但我的调节器受损太重
But my regulator had sustained too much damage.

980
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:00,650
你母亲
Your mother,

981
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,670
没有丝毫犹豫
she didn't hesitate.

982
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,100
简妮特  不要
Janet! No!

983
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:15,000
她关掉了她的调节器
She turned off her regulator

984
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,220
缩小到亚原子级
and went subatomic

985
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,510
解除了炸弹
to deactivate the bomb.

986
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:24,660
她牺牲了
And she was gone.

987
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,610
你妈妈是个英雄
Your mom died a hero.

988
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,410
接下来的十年时间
And I spent the next 10 years

989
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:41,170
我试图了解量子领域的一切
trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.

990
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,560
你想把她找回来
You were trying to bring her back.

991
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:51,880
但我只了解到我们有多无知
But all I learned was we know nothing.

992
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:58,420
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

993
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,270
是她自己的选择
She made her choice.

994
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:10,320
但你为什么不早点告诉我
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

995
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,880
我是想保护你
I was trying to protect you.

996
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:18,120
我已经失去了你母亲
I lost your mother.

997
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:23,050
我不想也失去你
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

998
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,380
对不起
I'm sorry.

999
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:29,940
好棒
This is awesome.

1000
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,720
真的好棒
It's awesome, you know?

1001
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,230
你俩终于解除隔阂  重归于好
You guys are breaking down walls, you're healing.

1002
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,060
这很重要
It's important.

1003
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,000
我把气氛毁了  是不是
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

1004
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,620
没错  的确
Yes, you did. Yes.

1005
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,090
我去泡点茶
I'm going to make some tea.

1006
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,380
搞定
Nailed it!

1007
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:04,760
好样的  安东蚁
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

1008
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:37,500
你训练的最后阶段是潜入
The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.

1009
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,660
好冷
It's freezing!

1010
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,980
你不能在衣服里加层绒吗
You couldn't make a suit with a flannel lining?

1011
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:44,930
你得拿到这个信号诱饵的原型机
You must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy.

1012
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:47,560
我当年还在神盾局的时候研发的
It's a device that I invented during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

1013
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,690
我们要用它来干扰
We need it to counteract the transmission blockers

1014
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,870
克洛斯在未来保险库装的通讯拦截器
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

1015
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:55,080
现在正在霍华德·斯塔克的
It's currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark's

1016
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,630
纽约州北边的一个仓库积灰呢
old storage facilities in upstate New York.

1017
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,860
应该是小菜一碟
Should be a piece of cake.

1018
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:01,390
你在目标区域上空了
You're over the target area.

1019
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,000
现在出发  斯科特
Disengage now, Scott!

1020
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,340
A中队  走
Squadron A, go!

1021
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,790
B队  走
B, go!

1022
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:09,980
C队  走
C, go!

1023
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,660
好了  安东蚁  这次别再把我甩下去了
All right, Ant-thony, please don't drop me this time.

1024
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:17,360
从搬糖块到干这个差距也太大了
Oh, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this!

1025
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,510
保持冷静
Stay calm.

1026
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,650
伙计们  我们可能有麻烦了
Guys? We might have a problem.

1027
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,720
汉克  你不是说是个旧库房吗
Hank, didn't you say this was some old warehouse?

1028
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:27,620
它不是
It's not!

1029
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,250
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch!

1030
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:34,540
-斯科特  快回来  -任务中止
- Scott, get out of there. - Abort!

1031
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:35,670
立刻中止
Abort now!

1032
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,220
没事  看着不像有人在
No, it's okay. It doesn't look like anyone's home.

1033
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,460
安东蚁  飞到屋顶去
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

1034
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:42,850
他要把衣服搞丢了
He's gonna lose the suit.

1035
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:44,520
他命都要丢了
He's gonna lose his life.

1036
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,170
好了  我到目标建筑的屋顶了
All right, I'm on the roof of the target building.

1037
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:55,030
有人在  斯科特
Somebody's home, Scott.

1038
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:59,470
山姆  下面出什么事了
What's going on down there, Sam?

1039
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:00,720
是猎鹰
It's the Falcon!

1040
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,630
感应器说这里有东西  但我什么都没看到
I had a sensor trip but I'm not seeing anything.

1041
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:04,970
等等
Wait a second.

1042
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:07,060
任务中止  斯科特  立刻中止
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

1043
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:08,730
没事的  他看不到我
It's okay. He can't see me.

1044
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:09,930
我看得到你
I can see you.

1045
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:11,070
他看得到我
He can see me.

1046
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,440
你好  我是斯科特
Hi. I'm Scott.

1047
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,010
他刚直接自报家门了吗
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

1048
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:17,870
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

1049
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:20,320
首先  我是你的粉丝
First off, I'm a big fan.

1050
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,470
谢谢  你谁啊
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

1051
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:24,140
我是蚁人
I'm Ant-Man.

1052
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,510
"蚁人"吗
"Ant-Man"?

1053
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,960
怎么  没听过我大名吗
What? You haven't heard of me?

1054
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,300
不  你是该没听过我
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

1055
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,290
你要说明你是来干什么的吗
You wanna tell me what you want?

1056
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:33,730
我想过来拿个仪器
I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology.

1057
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:35,450
借用几天  用完就还
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

1058
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:38,270
我得拿去拯救世界  你懂的
I need it to save the world. You know how that is.

1059
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,100
我确实懂
I know exactly how that is.

1060
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:41,670
锁定入侵者
Located the breach.

1061
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:43,490
-马上逮捕他  -对不住了
- Bringing him in. - Sorry about this!

1062
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,640
你他妈在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

1063
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:53,450
入侵者为成年男性
Breach is an adult male,

1064
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:55,500
好像有某种缩小装置
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

1065
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,020
抱歉
Sorry!

1066
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,330
听着  我真的很抱歉  对不起
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

1067
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,160
够了
That's enough!

1068
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,290
安东蚁  帮下忙
Ant-thony! A little help!

1069
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,290
我看不见你了
I've lost visual.

1070
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,930
他在我的翅膀里
He's inside my pack!

1071
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:02,830
抱歉
Sorry!

1072
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:05,790
你看起来人很好
You seem like a really great guy.

1073
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,730
这事绝对不能被队长知道
It's really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.

1074
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:41,220
你刚那也太不负责而且很危险
That was completely irresponsible and dangerous!

1075
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,420
你威胁到了全盘计划
You jeopardized everything!

1076
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,270
你拿到了
You got it.

1077
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,040
干得好
Well done.

1078
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:06,990
等一下
Wait a minute.

1079
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:08,620
你刚是在表扬我吗
Did you just compliment me?

1080
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,610
他表扬我了  是吧
He did, didn't he?

1081
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,080
听起来是的
Kind of sounded like he did.

1082
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,600
我以前很厉害吧
I was good, wasn't I?

1083
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:19,080
还有我跟一个复仇者干了一架还没死
Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

1084
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,630
别沉溺于往事
Let us not dwell on the past.

1085
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:23,860
还得完成计划
We gotta finish our planning.

1086
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,680
别在意他
Don't mind him.

1087
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:29,740
你做得很好
You did good.

1088
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:37,930
达伦
Darren.

1089
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,330
你是怎么进来的
How the hell did you get in here?

1090
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,950
前门没锁  汉克
You left the front door open, Hank.

1091
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:47,610
这回是真的了
It's official.

1092
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:48,800
你老了
You're old.

1093
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,070
计划图纸
The plans.

1094
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,200
他会杀了他
He will kill him.

1095
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:59,260
你有何贵干
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

1096
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:01,960
我有好消息
I have good news.

1097
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:02,940
是吗
Really?

1098
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,060
是什么
What's that?

1099
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,870
皮姆科技  你一手建立的公司
Pym Tech, the company you created,

1100
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:11,600
马上要成为世界上
is about to become one of the most

1101
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,330
效益最好的机构了
profitable operations in the world.

1102
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:18,310
光是明天的买卖就能赚150亿
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales, tomorrow alone.

1103
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:25,920
不用谢了
You're welcome.

1104
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:32,850
我知道很奇怪  但我想你也在场
I know this is odd, but I'd like you to be there.

1105
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,420
那是我的时刻  我想让你也看到
This is my moment. I want you to see it.

1106
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,070
好的  达伦  可以
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1107
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:39,180
我会到场的
I'll be there.

1108
01:07:56,430 --> 01:07:57,710
你看中我什么了
What did you see in me?

1109
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,250
我不懂你什么意思
I don't know what you mean.

1110
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,480
多年以前  你选中了我
All those years ago, you picked me.

1111
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,280
你看到了什么
What did you see?

1112
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:09,500
我看到了我自己
I saw myself.

1113
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:11,900
那你为什么又把我推开
Then why did you push me away?

1114
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:17,300
因为你太像我了
Because I saw too much of myself.

1115
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:29,860
他知道了  那是陷阱
He knows. He's baiting you.

1116
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:31,420
我们得中止计划
We have to call it off.

1117
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:32,970
我们都在冒险
We're all taking risks.

1118
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:34,110
要是他看到我在这里怎么办
What if he saw me here?

1119
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,390
他没看到的  没有可能
He didn't. There's no way.

1120
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:36,920
你怎么能确定
How do you know that?

1121
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:41,170
达伦·克洛斯

1122
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,520
达伦  你好
Darren, hi.

1123
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,670
霍普  你现在在哪
Hope, where are you right now?

1124
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:51,700
我在家  怎么了
I'm at home. Why?

1125
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,980
我刚去见汉克了
I just saw Hank.

1126
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,160
他还是和以前一样轻视我
I still get nothing but contempt from him.

1127
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:58,690
别跟他生气  他就是个糟老头
Don't let him rile you up. He's just a senile old man.

1128
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,180
所有人都要加班加点的工作
We need to start everyone working around the clock.

1129
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,140
马上准备运行生产线
Get the assembly line up and running.

1130
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,950
我要加强警备
And I'm tripling security.

1131
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:06,890
所有入口都要设感应器
Full sensors at all entrances

1132
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:10,240
通风口都装上钢制微孔筛
and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1133
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,020
好的  好主意
Great. Good idea.

1134
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:15,160
谢谢你  霍普  有你在我这边真幸运
Thank you, Hope. I'm so lucky to have you on my team.

1135
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:23,050
他要加强警备  他已经疯了还盯上你了
He's tripling security. He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

1136
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,280
但他没有盯上你
But he is not onto you.

1137
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,770
他要在所有入口加装人体扫描仪
He's adding full body scanners to all entrances

1138
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,720
还要关闭外部通风口
and closing exterior vents.

1139
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,580
斯科特怎么进去
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

1140
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:34,520
总水管
The water main.

1141
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,880
你没法加强总水管的安保措施
You can't add security to a water main.

1142
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,180
水压太强了  但要是我们能减弱水压
The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it,

1143
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:41,290
我就能进去
that's how I get in.

1144
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:43,770
得有人在大楼的控制中心
Somebody would have to reach the building's control center

1145
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:45,080
去调节水压
to change the water pressure.

1146
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,500
我和汉克得陪在克洛斯身边
Hank and I will be beside Cross.

1147
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,770
我们根本不可能做到
How are we supposed to do that?

1148
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:49,490
我们要招兵买马了
So we expand our team.

1149
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:51,220
需要哪些人呢
What do we need?

1150
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,060
内部要安插一名假保安
A fake security guard on the inside

1151
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,510
负责进入供水系统降压
to de-pressurize the water system,

1152
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:58,150
另一个人要侵入供电系统切断激光光束
somebody else to hack in to the power supply and kill the laser grid,

1153
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,670
还要一个人接应我们逃跑
and a getaway guy.

1154
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:04,700
不不不  那三个蠢货不行  绝对不行
No, no. No, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.

1155
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,620
谢谢您的咖啡  女士
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

1156
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:10,200
很少会有人被打劫了还邀请劫匪坐坐
It's not too often that you rob a place and then get welcomed back.

1157
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,790
因为我们打劫了你
Because we just robbed you.

1158
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:17,620
你知道他是因为偷了台冰沙机被捕的吧
You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1159
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:18,760
是两台冰沙机
Two smoothie machines.

1160
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,200
你确定他们能胜任吗
Are you sure they can handle this?

1161
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,890
肯定可以  我们可是专业的
Oh, we can handle it. We're professionals.

1162
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:25,710
请原谅我们对你们没什么信心
You'll forgive us if we're not instilled with confidence.

1163
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:28,330
各位都先冷静一下  淡定淡定
Well, hey, everybody just kick back and relax a little bit, man.

1164
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:29,710
我们懂这行
We know our business.

1165
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:32,260
我们可闯入过这老房子  不是吗
We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn't we?

1166
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,460
是我放你们进来的
I let you.

1167
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:36,760
那也可以说是我让你放我进来的
Well, one could say that I let you let me.

1168
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:39,450
没事  他们能搞定
Look, it's okay. They can handle this.

1169
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:40,340
对  我们能搞定
Yeah, we can handle it.

1170
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,280
-你有他们的证件了吗  -他在系统里了
- You got their credentials? - He's in the system.

1171
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,480
我在系统里了
I'm in the system?

1172
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,930
你在系统里了
You're in the system.

1173
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,140
系统里吗
The system?

1174
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:48,360
好吧  我们死定了
Yeah, we're doomed.

1175
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:51,330
好了  有样东西要给你们看看
All right. There's something you guys need to see.

1176
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,190
等你走到这个转角
When you get to this corner,

1177
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:56,330
你的左侧会有三间办公室
there's gonna be three offices on your left side.

1178
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:57,380
我操
Damn!

1179
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:01,920
真是太酷炫了  哥们
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1180
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,510
听着  过一会儿会很诡异
Now, look, this is gonna get weird, all right?

1181
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,510
会很吓人  但其实没事
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.

1182
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:08,010
不必害怕
There's no reason to be scared.

1183
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:09,640
不不  老子我天不怕地不怕
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

1184
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,170
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Yeah.

1185
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,180
那就好
Good.

1186
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,480
绝对是吉普赛人搞的鬼把戏
This is the work of Gypsies.

1187
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,750
这是巫术吧
That's witchcraft.

1188
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,000
太厉害了
Wow, that's amazing.

1189
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,240
感觉就像大卫·科波菲尔那样
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

1190
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,360
这是什么魔法吧
That's some kind of wizardry.

1191
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,480
是巫术
This is sorcery!

1192
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,510
哥们  你是怎么做到的
How'd you do that, bro?

1193
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:32,240
千万别怕  看看你的肩膀
Don't freak out. Look at your shoulder.

1194
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:35,180
滚开  滚开
Get off! Get off!

1195
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,250
你不是还说你天不怕地不怕吗
Wait, I thought Daddy didn't get scared!

1196
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,340
我让每人吃了半片镇静剂
I gave them each half a Xanax

1197
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,840
汉克还给他们解释这套衣服的原理呢
and Hank explained the science of the suit to them.

1198
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,380
他们就睡着了
They fell right asleep.

1199
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:49,220
听着  我很感谢你能...
Hey, look, I wanna thank you for...

1200
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:50,470
不  别谢我
No, please don't.

1201
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:54,150
我们这么做都是为了大义
We're all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us.

1202
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:55,210
我只是很高兴你还有
I'm just glad that you might have

1203
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:57,880
那么一丝机会可能会成功
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

1204
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,330
谢谢你为我打气
Hey, thank you, you know, for that pep talk.

1205
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:03,280
老实说  我已经从原来的瞧不起你
You know, the honest truth is, I actually went from despising you

1206
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,210
变得快开始喜欢你了
to almost liking you.

1207
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:07,380
你真的应该去写诗
You really should write poetry.

1208
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,210
去睡会吧  斯科特
Get some sleep, Scott.

1209
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:03,970
好了  确定一下
All right, just so we're clear,

1210
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:05,730
我们都清楚自己的任务了吧
everyone here knows their role, right?

1211
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:07,350
-戴夫  -负责驾车逃跑
- Dave? - Wheels on the ground.

1212
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,850
-科特  -负责搞定监控
- Kurt? - Eyes in the sky.

1213
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,320
-路易斯  -你懂的
- Luis? - Oh, man, you know it.

1214
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,810
没错  我要穿制服
You know what? I get to wear a uniform.

1215
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:13,380
-就是这样  -路易斯
- That's what's up. - Luis.

1216
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,710
抱歉  我清楚任务  我只是太兴奋了
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good. I'm just excited.

1217
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:16,870
而且你的女朋友真的很性感
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.

1218
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:18,430
看到她我也会特别紧张
So, you know, that makes me nervous, too.

1219
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:19,640
你真的很漂亮  女士
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

1220
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:21,190
-我的天哪  -她不是我的...
- Oh, my Lord. - She's not my...

1221
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:22,650
对了  我想到个策略
You know what? I was thinking of a tactic,

1222
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,120
我卧底进去时可以用
like when I go undercover.

1223
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,300
比如吹口哨  你懂我的意思吧  融入进去
Like a whistling. You know what I'm saying? To like, blend in.

1224
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,820
不行  别吹口哨  不准吹
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.

1225
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,210
这又不是表演才艺节目  不准吹
It's not The Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.

1226
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:50,380
一区一切正常
All clear in Sector One.

1227
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:56,510
进来
Step out.

1228
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:00,270
没问题
All clear.

1229
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,110
准备就绪
We're set.

1230
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:08,740
祝我好运
Wish me luck.

1231
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,120
设备上线
Utilities online.

1232
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:36,500
你在干什么
Hey! What are you doing?

1233
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:41,320
头儿让我来检查下这  我就来了
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area, so I'm securing it.

1234
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:44,310
我就是头儿
I'm the boss.

1235
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:46,710
控制室1.3
Utilities 1.3...

1236
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,300
水位正在下降
Water level is dropping!

1237
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,540
爬到抽气管上
Coming up on extraction pipe.

1238
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:34,390
我看到了
All right, I see it.

1239
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:43,420
拜托了  我得爬上去
All right, come on, I gotta get up there.

1240
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:46,250
没错  没错  就是这样
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

1241
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:51,510
没错  我们做到了  做到了  快点
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

1242
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:58,300
好了  起飞吧  安东蚁
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

1243
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:11,510
蚁人进入大楼了
The Ant-Man is in the building.

1244
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:14,380
皮姆刚到  时间正好
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

1245
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:18,310
外面还有辆福特皇冠
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.

1246
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:19,490
有什么问题吗
This is problem?

1247
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:21,850
福特皇冠是卧底警察
Considering the Crown Vic's the most commonly used car

1248
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,620
最常开的车
for undercover cops, man,

1249
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:25,530
没错  出问题了
yes, this is problem.

1250
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,560
是皮姆
That's Pym.

1251
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:34,120
不
Oh, no.

1252
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:35,590
我在部署子弹蚂蚁
I'm deploying the bullet ants.

1253
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:37,420
拟猛蚁亚科什么什么蚁
Paraponera clavata de Merna Merna...

1254
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,940
不记得学名叫什么  但这人惨了
I don't remember what it's called, but I feel bad for this guy.

1255
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:53,520
瞧瞧  这还差不多
See? That's what I'm talking about.

1256
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,330
这就是我所说的在严肃的
That's what I call an unfortunate casualty

1257
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:58,080
行动中不幸的受害者
in a very serious operation.

1258
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,010
信号诱饵就位
Signal decoy in place.

1259
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:12,370
凶巴巴美女也搞定了  斯科特
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

1260
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,910
看来皮姆被逮捕了
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1261
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:17,470
斯科特  出问题了
Scott, we have problem.

1262
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,270
问题  什么问题
Problem? What's the problem?

1263
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:22,960
戴夫  戴夫  我们可没这计划
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

1264
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:23,890
听我说
Listen to me.

1265
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:28,040
如果我不进这大楼  有人就会死
If I don't get into this building, people will die.

1266
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,800
有那么夸张吗
That's awfully dramatic.

1267
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:34,810
是不是在逗我
Are you kidding me?

1268
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,740
问题解决了
Problem solved.

1269
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,020
我看起来怎么样
How do I look?

1270
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:11,290
终于来了
There he is.

1271
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:15,260
刚刚好  走吧
Just in time. Come on.

1272
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:27,020
十二项验证
12-point verification.

1273
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:29,190
有点过头了  你不觉得吗  达伦
Little over-the-top, don't you think, Darren?

1274
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:30,430
正在确认授权
Confirming authorization level.

1275
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:32,250
防范于未然嘛
Well, you can never be too safe.

1276
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,090
准许进入
Access granted.

1277
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:42,180
得为你鼓鼓掌  达伦
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

1278
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,820
你真的做到了
You really did it.

1279
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,930
这还只是一部分  汉克
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

1280
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:14,900
前往第二目标位置
Arriving in second position.

1281
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,390
全速前进  安东蚁  冲吧
All right, top speed, Ant-thony. Let's go!

1282
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:31,510
继续向指定位置前进
Proceeding to command position.

1283
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:50,270
我马上就回来  安东蚁
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.

1284
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:54,350
好了  各位  我到了
All right, guys. I'm in position.

1285
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,220
我要给蚂蚁们发指令了
I'm gonna signal the ants.

1286
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:57,850
不不不
No, no, no, no, no!

1287
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:00,990
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

1288
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:08,760
各就各位
Assume formation.

1289
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:11,010
好了  你们这些可爱的小家伙
All right, you cute little crazies,

1290
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:12,780
烧坏这些服务器吧
let's fry these servers!

1291
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:26,910
上吧兄弟们
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

1292
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:41,030
服务器已被毁坏
Servers are fried.

1293
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:43,090
备份数据均已被擦除
Data backup completely erased.

1294
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:44,780
正在前往粒子实验室
Heading to the particle chamber.

1295
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:53,170
你好  克洛斯博士
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1296
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:59,640
我的伙伴们答应了你的条件
My associates have agreed to your terms.

1297
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,710
太好了
Wonderful.

1298
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:03,200
卡森先生向这几位先生引荐了我
Mr. Carson introduced me to these fine gentlemen here.

1299
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,190
他们是九头蛇的代表们
They're representatives of Hydra.

1300
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:06,680
他们不是曾经那样了
They're not what they were.

1301
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,360
他们正在进行有趣的工作
They're doing some interesting work.

1302
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:10,590
而我也很享受这样
And I'm enjoying myself.

1303
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:14,480
你一直把技术藏起来不给我
You tried to hide your technology from me.

1304
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,130
现在你自食恶果了吧
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.

1305
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:25,550
我早就预料到你会出拳揍我
I mean, I saw that punch coming a mile away,

1306
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:27,940
可我还以为这一拳会很软弱无力呢
but I just figured it'd be all pathetic and weak.

1307
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:29,590
那你想错了
Well, you figured wrong.

1308
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:31,850
我见过这辆车
I know this van.

1309
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:34,670
有人吗
Anybody home?

1310
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,460
好了各位  我到了
All right, guys. I'm here.

1311
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:47,830
正在安装炸弹
I'm setting the charges.

1312
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:09,600
各位干得很好  接下来交给我吧
Great job, guys. I'll take it from here.

1313
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:20,410
安东蚁  辛苦了
Good boy, Ant-thony.

1314
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:23,710
最后目标位
Final position.

1315
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,350
各位  激光光栅关了吗
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?

1316
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:35,980
-快了  -并没搞定
- Almost. - No, you're not.

1317
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:38,110
-马上就好了  -并没有
- I'm getting close! - No, you're not.

1318
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:43,820
旧金山警察局
San Francisco P.D.!

1319
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:45,160
从车里出来
Out of the van!

1320
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:46,630
我知道你们在里面
I know you're in there!

1321
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:47,410
再快点
Make it go faster.

1322
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:49,240
哥们  别再催我了
Dude, seriously.

1323
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,710
准备跃入  听到没  科特
Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?

1324
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,390
马上就好
So close.

1325
01:22:58,450 --> 01:22:59,890
-等等  再等一会  -别动
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute! - Freeze!

1326
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:01,420
有个和我长得一模一样的黑人
There was a black guy that looked exactly like me

1327
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:03,630
袭击了我们  把我们关进这破车里
who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van.

1328
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,290
-给我出来  -我这不是在出来嘛
- Get out of the van! - Okay, I'm coming.

1329
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,420
别紧张
Take it easy!

1330
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,780
我不走  快上
No, I will not move! Go now!

1331
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:11,800
等等
Wait!

1332
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,560
什么  为什么又要等等
What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

1333
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,050
搞什么
What? What?

1334
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:27,710
小家伙
Hey, little guy.

1335
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:43,520
我一直都怀疑你还偷藏了一套衣服
I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere.

1336
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,760
那么问题来了
Which begs the question,

1337
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,040
这位新蚁人是谁
who is the new Ant-Man?

1338
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:50,970
这位让我敬爱的导师更加信任的人是谁
Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me?

1339
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:55,910
斯科特·朗
Scott Lang.

1340
01:23:57,090 --> 01:23:58,640
殉道者
A martyr

1341
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,260
反抗了社会也付出了代价
who took on the system and paid the price,

1342
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:05,330
失去了他的家庭和他唯一的女儿
losing his family and his only daughter in the process.

1343
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:08,130
正好是你的口味  汉克
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

1344
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:14,830
他越了狱  没有留下任何线索
He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how.

1345
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:18,520
然后神奇地消失了
And then he disappears magically,

1346
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,440
虽然身上一分钱都没有
despite having no money to his name.

1347
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,850
现在他把蚁人服带来了
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

1348
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:30,570
唯一能与我的发明相提并论的设计
The only thing that can rival my creation.

1349
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:33,680
达伦  别这么做
Darren, don't do this.

1350
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:36,020
如果你把它卖给这些人
If you sell to these men,

1351
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,610
一定会引发世界混乱
it's gonna be chaos.

1352
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:39,090
我已经卖了
I already have.

1353
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:40,550
而且多亏了你
And for twice the price,

1354
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:41,650
卖了两倍的价格
thanks to you.

1355
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:45,970
要成功侵入复联大楼可不容易
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility.

1356
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:48,580
庆幸的是  消息传千里
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1357
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:49,900
我会把黄衫卖给他们
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket,

1358
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,540
不过粒子我就自己留着了
but I'm keeping the particle to myself.

1359
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:54,560
这可不烧柴油
They don't run on diesel.

1360
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,080
如果想要燃料  就得来找我
If you want the fuel, you'll have to come to me.

1361
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,420
你会怎么称呼全世界
What do you call the only man

1362
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:04,080
唯一一位手握最强大武器的人
who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?

1363
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:07,100
世界上最强大的人
The most powerful man in the world.

1364
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,240
你为我感到自豪了吗
You proud of me yet?

1365
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,620
现在收手还来得及  达伦
You can stop this, Darren. It's not too late.

1366
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:14,410
早已经来不及了
It's been too late for a long time now.

1367
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:16,980
达伦
Darren!

1368
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,540
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1369
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:23,800
他照顾不好你  就像你也照顾不好我
He wasn't any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.

1370
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,580
这不是原来的你
This is not who you are.

1371
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:28,670
你的大脑化学物质被粒子改变了
It's the particles altering your brain chemistry.

1372
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:38,570
等等  等等
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1373
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:43,630
你说得对  必须我亲自动手
You're right. I have to be the one to do it.

1374
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:47,080
好戏来了
Here we go.

1375
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,760
把  枪  放  下
Drop your gun.

1376
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,980
那天晚上我去他家本来是想杀他
You know, I came to the house the other night to kill him,

1377
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,600
可你当时也在
but you were there.

1378
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:02,170
你走火入魔了  我能帮你  把枪放下
You're sick and I can help you. Just put the gun down.

离我们远点
Get away from us!

1505

你会变成亚原子级

你会变成亚原子级
You would go subatomic.

1510
01:40:22,030 --> 01:40:22,970

Oh, no.

1511
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:36,960
你会进入一个现实
You would enter a reality

1512
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:42,380
在那里一切关于时间和空间的概念

爸爸  回来
Come back, Daddy!

1517
01:40:59,510 --> 01:41:05,080
因为你会不断缩小
as you shrink for all eternity...

1518
01:41:07,910 --> 01:41:09,410
你所知
Everything that you know

1519
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:13,170
和所爱的一切
and love,

1520
01:41:14,990 --> 01:41:15,970
都将一去不复返
gone forever.

1521
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:19,210
爸爸  你在哪里
Daddy, where are you?

1522
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:38,780
你在哪里
Where are you?

1523
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,530
你在哪里啊
Where are you?

1524
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:45,660
-爸爸  -凯西
- Daddy! - Cassie.

1525
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,940
爸爸  回来
Come back, Daddy!

1526
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:01,930
不要乱动调节器
Do not screw with the regulator!

1527
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:33,800
爸爸
Daddy!

1528
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,860
我好爱你
I love you so much.

1529
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,480
我也爱你
I love you, too.

1530
01:42:41,190 --> 01:42:42,340
很爱很爱
So much.

1531
01:42:46,650 --> 01:42:48,770
房顶上有个大洞
You know, there's a big hole in the roof.

1532
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:52,520
抱歉
Sorry.

1533
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:57,550
-她没事吧  -嗯  她没事
- Is she all right? - Yeah, she's fine.

1534
01:42:59,610 --> 01:43:00,580
妈妈
Mommy!

1535
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,510
她没事  她没事
She's fine, she's fine.

1536
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:15,840
拜托  斯科特
Scott, please.

1537
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,570
你什么都不记得了吗
You don't remember anything?

1538
01:43:18,570 --> 01:43:20,340
汉克  我记不得了
Hank. I don't.

1539
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:22,000
肯定还有些什么的
There must be something else.

1540
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:26,390
好吧  我觉得人类的大脑
Well, I suppose the human mind

1541
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:29,940
是没法理解这种经历的
just can't comprehend the experience,

1542
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:33,260
但你却成功了
but you made it.

1543
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:35,120
你进去以后
You went in,

1544
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:38,620
又出来了
and you got out.

1545
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:42,240
真棒
It's amazing.

1546
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:44,170
斯科特
Scott,

1547
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:46,210
我带你出去
I'll walk you out.

1548
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:52,180
好好休息
Get some rest.

1549
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:02,340
这真的有可能吗
Is it possible?

1550
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:21,810
什么时候的事
When did this happen?

1551
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:23,220
没什么事
Nothing's happening.

1552
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:25,660
等等  算是有点什么事吧
Whoa. Hold on. Something's kind of happening.

1553
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:27,720
要真是这样
Well, if that's the case,

1554
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,010
再给我来一枪
shoot me again.

1555
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:30,770
我不知道你刚在干嘛
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing,

1556
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:32,110
对我又抱又亲的
grabbing and kissing me like that.

1557
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:34,040
我也有点小惊讶呢
I'm a little surprised myself.

1558
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:36,770
我得去个地方  一会见  汉克
I have to get somewhere. I'll see you later, Hank.

1559
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:37,800
霍普  你真是的
Really, Hope.

1560
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:39,890
斯科特
Scott.

1561
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:42,750
-满嘴胡话  -没错
- You're full of shit. - Oh, yeah.

1562
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:45,810
斯科特  我今天见了我们警监
Scott, I met with my captain today.

1563
01:44:45,810 --> 01:44:48,380
他想要你出狱那晚的报告
He wanted a report on the night that you got out of jail.

1564
01:44:49,370 --> 01:44:50,960
摄像头出现了故障
Something happened with the cameras.

1565
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:53,750
一些电路被烧坏了
Some circuits got fried.

1566
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:57,250
但我跟他说你是走正规程序出去的
But I told him that you were processed correctly.

1567
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:58,370
真的吗
Really?

1568
01:44:58,760 --> 01:44:59,640
是的
Well, yeah.

1569
01:45:01,090 --> 01:45:04,890
不能因为电子故障就把凯西的爸爸送回监狱  对吧
Can't be sending Cassie's dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1570
01:45:04,890 --> 01:45:06,040
谢谢你  帕克斯顿
Thank you, Paxton.

1571
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:07,700
我太感动了
I'm blown away.

1572
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:10,790
谢谢你为凯西所做的一切
Thank you for everything you do for Cassie.

1573
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:13,210
不甚荣幸
Well, that's my pleasure.

1574
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:16,840
不过这次  我是为了你
But, no. This one, I did for you.

1575
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,370
好尴尬
This is awkward.

1576
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:21,870
-没错  -没错
- Yeah.  - Yeah.

1577
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:24,410
这事之后我们还有什么可谈的呢
I mean, what do we even talk about after all of that?

1578
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:25,770
-我知道  -什么
- Oh, I know. - What?

1579
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:27,670
我今天第一次横翻筋斗
I did my first cartwheel today.

1580
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:28,410
什么
What?

1581
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:30,810
没错  她练了一个星期了
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.

1582
01:45:30,810 --> 01:45:31,660
今天真是见证奇迹的时刻
But today was the magic day.

1583
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:34,390
我用手机录下来了  看
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

1584
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,720
不  这不可能是凯西  这不是你
No, that can't be Cassie. That's not you.

1585
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:38,670
是她
Yeah, it is.

1586
01:45:38,670 --> 01:45:41,300
这分明是专业体操运动员  不可能是你
This is a professional gymnast. There is no way that's you.

1587
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:42,700
的确就是她
Yeah, that's her.

1588
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:45,330
好狗狗
Good boy.

1589
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:49,510
亲爱的  真的太棒了
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.

1590
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,490
抱歉
Sorry.

1591
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,270
工作上的事
It's work.

1592
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:01,800
好的
All right.

1593
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,560
这样吧  把事实告诉我
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

1594
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,190
讲重点  只讲重点
Just the facts. Only the facts.

1595
01:46:05,190 --> 01:46:08,660
呼气  专注  简简单单
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

1596
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:10,650
行  行  没问题的
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1597
01:46:10,650 --> 01:46:13,220
我和我表哥伊格纳西奥去艺术馆
So, I'm at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1598
01:46:13,230 --> 01:46:15,280
是一个抽象表现主义的展览
And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit.

1599
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,570
但你知道的  我比较喜欢新立体主义的作品
But you know me, I'm more like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?

1600
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:20,610
但有个人叫罗斯科的人非常棒  天呐
But there was this one Rothko that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!

1601
01:46:20,610 --> 01:46:21,740
路易斯
Luis.

1602
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:22,830
好了  抱歉  抱歉
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1603
01:46:22,830 --> 01:46:24,980
我就是太兴奋了
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

1604
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:26,770
但不管怎么说  伊格纳西奥告诉我
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,

1605
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:28,400
"我昨晚在焦点酒吧
"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick

1606
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,450
遇到一个超正点的作家妹子  超级正点
at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.

1607
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:32,000
特别特别正点  然后他
Like crazy-stupid fine." And he

1608
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,120
过去跟酒保说
goes up to the bartender and goes,

1609
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:34,670
看那个和我一起的妹子  懂我意思不
"Look at the girl I'm with. You know what I'm sayin'?

1610
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:35,760
她超正的  对吧
"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"

1611
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,910
酒保说  是啊  的确超正
The bartender's all like, "Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."

1612
01:46:38,910 --> 01:46:40,920
所以这个作家妹子告诉伊格纳西奥
So this writer chick tells Ignacio,

1613
01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:43,760
我可是小道八卦界女王
"Yo, I'm like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism,

1614
01:46:43,770 --> 01:46:45,740
我和幕后大佬关系可好了
"And I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains,

1615
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:46,500
你懂我说得不
"You know what I'm saying?"

1616
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,070
伊格纳西奥就问  真的呀
Ignacio's like, "For real?"

1617
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:49,660
她说  真的啊
And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,

1618
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:50,930
我不能告诉你我线人是谁
I can't tell you who my contact is,

1619
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:52,780
因为他和复联一起工作
"Because he works with the Avengers."

1620
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:53,980
天呐
Oh, no.

1621
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:56,580
这人听上去很厉害呢
Yeah, and this dude sounds like a badass, man.

1622
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:57,700
他走过去跟她说
Like, he comes up to her and says,

1623
01:46:57,700 --> 01:46:59,580
"我在找个超级英雄界的新人
"Yo, I'm looking for this dude who's new on the scene,

1624
01:46:59,590 --> 01:47:01,040
"刚初来乍到
"who's flashing his fresh tack,

1625
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,620
"技能出众的人  你知道谁吗"
"who's got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got?"

1626
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:05,720
她说  什么人都有啊
And she's like, "Well, we got everything nowaday.

1627
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,840
有会蹦的
We got a guy who jumps.

1628
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,240
会飞的  还有爬墙的
"We got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls.

1629
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:10,300
你得说具体点
"You gotta be more specific."

1630
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:12,700
他说  我要找个能缩小的
And he's like, "I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."

1631
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:14,610
我说  靠  我很紧张
And I'm, like, "Damn!". I got all nervous

1632
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:16,270
因为我要为你保守秘密
'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1633
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:17,370
所以我问伊格纳西奥
So I asked Ignacio,

1634
01:47:17,370 --> 01:47:19,530
"那个狠角色是不是让超正作家找你
"Did the badass tell the stupid-fine writer chick

1635
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:21,910
让你来找我  因为我和他要找的
to tell you to tell me, because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

1636
01:47:21,910 --> 01:47:23,210
那个蚁人关系很好吗
"That he's looking for him?"

1637
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:26,300
然后呢  他说什么
And? What'd he say?

1638
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:31,150
他说  没错
He said, "Yes."

1639
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:41,610
蚁  人

1640
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:41,650
蚁  人

1641
01:48:41,650 --> 01:48:41,690
蚁  人

1642
01:48:41,690 --> 01:48:41,740
蚁  人

1643
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:41,780
蚁  人

1644
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:41,820
蚁  人

1645
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:41,860
蚁  人

1646
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:41,900
蚁  人

1647
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:41,940
蚁  人

1648
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:41,990
蚁  人

1649
01:48:41,990 --> 01:48:44,240
蚁  人

1650
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:44,740
蚁  人

1651
01:49:26,450 --> 01:49:28,140
我想给你看个东西
There's something I want to show you.

1652
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:34,180
力量是无法摧毁的
I realized you can't destroy power.

1653
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,530
只能尽量不被歹人触及
All you can do is make sure that it's in the right hands.

1654
01:49:46,070 --> 01:49:48,360
这个升级版原型衣
This is an advanced prototype

1655
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:51,200
是我和你母亲一同研发的
that your mother and I worked on together.

1656
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,810
她都没有机会用
She never got to use it.

1657
01:49:56,040 --> 01:50:00,620
但我现在明白了  这是我们为你造的
But now I realize that we were... We were working on it for you.

1658
01:50:07,170 --> 01:50:09,290
是时候完成这件衣服了
Maybe it's time we finished it.

1659
01:50:16,430 --> 01:50:17,970
是时候了
It's about damn time.

1660
01:50:19,110 --> 01:50:22,160
片尾还有彩蛋

1661
01:56:18,950 --> 01:56:19,980
嗨  队长
Hey, Cap!

1662
01:56:34,030 --> 01:56:36,410
一周前做这件事肯定更容易
This would have been a lot easier a week ago.

1663
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:39,210
-如果我给托尼打电话  -他不会相信我们的
- If we call Tony... - He won't believe us.

1664
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:40,090
就算他相信
Even if he did...

1665
01:56:40,090 --> 01:56:42,390
协议应该不准他帮忙吧
Who knows if the Accords will let him help.

1666
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:44,780
我们现在只能靠自己了
We're on our own.

1667
01:56:46,540 --> 01:56:47,520
或许不用
Maybe not.

1668
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:51,300
我认识一个人
I know a guy.

1669
01:56:52,270 --> 01:56:55,940
蚁人将于美队3回归
