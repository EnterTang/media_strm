1
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:16,327
未来
The future.

2
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,831
一个黑暗 孤寂的世界
A dark, desolate world.

3
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:31,009
战争 苦难 死亡
A world of war, suffering, loss...

4
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,219
笼罩着双方
on both sides.

5
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:38,808
变种人和挺身而出帮助他们的人类
Mutants and the humans who dared to help them.

6
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:46,441
都在抵抗一个无法战胜的敌人
Fighting an enemy we cannot defeat.

7
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:16,221
这是我们不可避免的命运吗
Are we destined down this path?

8
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:21,768
和曾经无数种物种一样 走上自取灭亡的道路
Destined to destroy ourselves like so many species before us?

9
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:29,150
还是及时进化 以求改变自我
Or can we evolve fast enough to change ourselves?

10
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:31,152
改变命运
Change our fate?

11
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,745
未来是否真是定数
Is the future truly set?

12
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,252
它们来了 
They're here!

13
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,051
来不及了
Time's up.

14
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,218
哨兵
Sentinels!

15
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:24,474
太阳黑子
Sunspot!

16
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:30,563
快走吧
Let's go.

17
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:20,822
快跑
Run!

18
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:23,533
快走
Go!

19
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,010
闪烁 不
Blink! No!

20
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,600
你来晚了 混蛋
Too late, assholes.

21
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,746
不许动 你这个变种人渣滓
Don't move, you mutant scum!

22
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,626
不
No!

23
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,213
趴在地上 双手放在头后面
Flat on the ground, hands behind your head!

24
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:31,762
我们的人所剩无几
So few of us left.

25
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:36,183
教授
Professor?

26
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,728
找到了
I've found them.

27
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,154
教授
Professor!

28
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,408
鲍比
嗨 暴风女
Bobby.
Hey, Storm.

29
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:17,576
嗨 小子
Hey, kid.

30
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,122
教授 你来了
Professor, you made it.

31
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:46,814
每次哨兵来袭 战戟都会发现它们
Whenever the Sentinels attack, Warpath spots them...

32
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,316
我送毕肖普回到袭击发生前
then I send Bishop back to warn us

33
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,901
去警告我们
of the attack before it happens.

34
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,863
让闪烁去找新的藏身处
Blink scouts the next site...

35
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,949
这样在它们找来之前我们就不在了
and then we leave before they ever know we were there.

36
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,744
因为 我们就没在过
Because... we never were.

37
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,746
什么叫你们就没在过
What do you mean you were never there?

38
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,330
她让毕肖普回到袭击发生的
She projects Bishop back in time

39
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:04,957
前几天去警告他们
a few days to warn the others...

40
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:06,751
未来的袭击
of the coming attack.

41
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,044
她能让毕肖普回到过去
So she sends Bishop back in time?

42
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,839
只是让他的意识回到他的过去
No, just his consciousness, into his younger self.

43
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:13,257
过去的身体里
His younger body.

44
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,217
喔
Wow.

45
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,013
这也许行得通 查尔斯
This might just work, Charles.

46
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,307
什么行得通
What might work?

47
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:27,104
哨兵计划最早是由玻利瓦尔·崔斯克博士提出的
The Sentinel program was originally conceived by Doctor Bolivar Trask.

48
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:31,901
他是70年代初期 世界顶尖的武器设计专家
In the early '70s, he was one of the world's leading weapons designers.

49
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:36,363
暗地里 他却在变种人身上进行着实验
But, covertly, he had begun experimenting on mutants...

50
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,700
利用他们的能力完成他的研究
using their gifts to fuel his own research.

51
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,243
这真是不可思议
This is extraordinary.

52
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,622
有一个变种人发现了他的研究内容
There was one mutant who had discovered what he was doing.

53
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:49,627
这家伙 可以随心所欲地变成 任何人
A mutant with the ability to transform herself into anyone.

54
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,545
魔形女
Mystique.

55
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,507
我认识的她叫瑞雯
I knew her as Raven.

56
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,133
我们从小相识
We met when we were children,

57
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,052
一起长大
grew up together.

58
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,721
她就像是我的妹妹
She was like a sister to me.

59
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,765
我想帮助她
I tried to help her...

60
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:06,477
没想到把她越推越远
but only succeeded in driving her away.

61
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:10,064
她走遍世界 追杀崔斯克
She hunted Trask across the world.

62
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,692
战争结束后 在1973年的巴黎会议上
And at the Paris Peace Accords in 1973,

63
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,027
越南战争后
after the Vietnam War...

64
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,238
她找到了崔斯克
she found Trask...

65
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,867
杀死了他
and killed him.

66
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,750
那是她第一次杀人
It was the first time she killed.

67
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,460
但不是最后一次
It wasn't her last.

68
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:35,381
崔斯克的死并没有导致她想要的结果
But killing Trask did not have the outcome she expected.

69
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,299
反而在一定程度上刺激了政府对
It only persuaded the government

70
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:39,552
哨兵计划的需求
of the need for his program.

71
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,929
他们当场抓住了她
They captured her that day...

72
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:44,890
折磨她 在她身上做实验
tortured her, experimented on her.

73
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:50,437
他们在她的DNA里发现了她具有变形能力的秘密
In her DNA, they discovered the secrets to her powers of transformation.

74
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,648
从此 他们就掌握了
It gave them the key they needed...

75
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:56,777
制造能应对任何变种能力的武器的关键所在
to create weapons that could adapt to any mutant power.

76
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,196
只用了不到50年
And in less than 50 years...

77
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,532
那种屠杀了我们众多同胞的
the machines that have destroyed...

78
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,618
机器就诞生了
so many of our kind were created.

79
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:09,248
一切都始于1973年的那一天
But it all started that day in 1973...

80
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,125
她第一次杀人那天
the day she first killed.

81
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,335
那天 她彻底变成了
The day she truly became...

82
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,879
魔形女
Mystique.

83
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,299
你想回到那一天
You want to go back there.

84
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,760
如果我能找到她 阻止她杀人
If I can get to her, stop the assassination...

85
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,304
不让她落入敌手
keep her out of their hands...

86
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:26,891
便能将哨兵计划扼杀在摇篮之中
then we can stop the Sentinels from ever being born.

87
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:30,227
让这场战争还没开始就结束
And end this war before it ever begins.

88
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:37,318
我可以送一个人回到几星期前
Uh, I can send someone back a couple weeks.

89
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,236
也许一个月前
Maybe a month.

90
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,573
可你要我送你回几十年前
But you're talking about going back decades.

91
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,576
教授 你拥有世界上最强的大脑
You have the most powerful brain in the world, Professor...

92
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:49,914
但是到了极限 它一样会崩溃
but the mind can only stretch so far before it snaps.

93
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:53,542
你会被撕成碎片 对不起
It would rip you apart. I'm sorry.

94
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,878
没人能承受这趟时空旅行
No one could survive that trip.

95
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,256
如果是一个大脑能自我修复的人呢
What if someone's mind has a way of snapping back?

96
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,427
一个即使被撕裂也能痊愈的人呢
What if someone can heal as fast as they're ripped apart?

97
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,595
这太冒险
It's a risk.

98
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:05,930
我知道
Yeah, I'm getting that.

99
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,723
不只是对你
Not just for you.

100
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,184
你这样 改变历史
You do this, you change history.

101
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,435
那是意义所在
Well, that's kind of the point.

102
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,771
我们中的某些人可能被杀
Some of us could be killed.

103
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,065
某些人可能永远不会出生
Some of us may never be born.

104
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,484
我们根本不能预料世界会产生什么改变
We have no idea how things may change.

105
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,527
我们还能继续坚持
We could keep going.

106
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,237
坚持反抗
Keep fighting.

107
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,614
直到何时
Until what?

108
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,660
你们得做出抉择
You've got a decision to make.

109
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,787
你们可以继续送毕肖普回到过去
You can keep sending Bishop back in time

110
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,914
反复地警告你们
over and over again to warn you,

111
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:36,043
直到某一天他失败了 你们也跟着丧生
until one day, he doesn't make it, and you all die.

112
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,045
或者你们放弃这次生命
Or you can give up this life.

113
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,798
那样他们和在这场战争中丧生的所有人
So that they and everyone else who died in this war

114
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,883
都能拥有未来
can actually have a future.

115
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:45,427
你是在要求我们把我们的生命牺牲给
You're asking us to sacrifice our lives

116
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,596
一个我们也许完全不曾存在的未来
for a future we might not even be a part of.

117
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:48,973
就是这样
Yes.

118
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,016
第二次机会
A second chance.

119
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,436
每个人的更好的机会
A better chance for everyone.

120
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:01,318
我的人手需要投票
My people need to vote.

121
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,573
他们刚刚投过了
They just did.

122
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,034
算上他们
They're in.

123
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,679
好了 大家散开
Okay, spread out.

124
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,015
各就各位
Take your positions.

125
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,573
我回到过去不知道在哪里的身体里
So I wake up in my younger body, God knows where.

126
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,866
然后呢
Then what?

127
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:52,036
你去我家找我 说服我
You'll need to go to my house and find me.

128
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,788
让我相信你说的那些事
Convince me of all of this.

129
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,582
你不能直接读心吗
Won't you be able to just read my mind?

130
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,877
1973年的我没有这种能力
I didn't have my powers in 1973.

131
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,381
罗根 我曾经为你做的事 现在你要为我做了
Logan, you're going to have to do for me what I once did for you.

132
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,342
指引我 引领我
Lead me, guide me.

133
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,970
那个与现在截然不同的我
I was a very different man then.

134
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,264
你要对我有耐心
You'll have to be patient with me.

135
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:15,559
我最擅长耐心了
Patience is my strongest suit.

136
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,895
你还要去找我
什么
You'll need me as well.
What?

137
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:20,814
魔形女离开查尔斯之后来找了我
After Mystique left Charles, she came with me...

138
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:24,026
是我使她走上了这条危险的路
and I set her on a dangerous path.

139
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,652
黑暗的路
A darker path.

140
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,405
你得让当年分道扬镳
It's going to take the two of us, side by side...

141
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:31,200
恩断义绝的我们携手合作
at a time when we couldn't be further apart.

142
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,913
好主意
Great.

143
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,415
我要去哪里找你
So where do I find you?

144
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,250
这有点复杂
Well, it's complicated.

145
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,796
你真的决定要这样做
Are you sure about this?

146
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,007
不只是他的能力受到考验
It's not just his power that'll be tested.

147
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,218
我知道这会对你造成什么影响
I've seen what this can do to you.

148
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:51,762
我能应对
I can handle this.

149
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,764
相信我
Trust me.

150
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,644
我猜我们要在来世相见了
I guess I'll see you in the next life.

151
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,160
当你的意识回到过去的时候
Basically, your body will go to sleep

152
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,621
身体就会陷入沉睡
while your mind travels back in time.

153
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:22,000
在这段时间 你的过去和现在是平行共存的
As long as you're back there, past and present will continue to coexist.

154
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,794
一旦你醒过来
But once you wake up...

155
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:27,840
你过去的作为就会覆盖历史
whatever you've done will take hold and become history.

156
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:31,051
而我们将只记得被改变后的历史
And for the rest of us, it will be the only history that we know.

157
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,513
过去的50年就将会不复存在
It will be like the last 50 years never happened.

158
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,182
这个时空 这场战争
And this world, and this war...

159
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,727
记得这一切的将只有你一个人
the only person who will remember it is you.

160
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,605
好了 罗根
All right, Logan...

161
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,315
现在你要清空思绪
I need you to clear your head

162
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,900
你要尽可能地保持平静
and to stay as calm as possible.

163
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,485
什么 什么意思
What? What do you mean?

164
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,946
如果你的意识过于波动 我会控制不住你
If your mind gets rocky, it will be harder for me to hold you...

165
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,407
你会掉进过去和未来的间隙里
and you could start to slip between past and future.

166
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,492
如果我有点小情绪呢
What if I need to get a little rocky?

167
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,911
想想平和的事
Think peaceful thoughts?

168
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,914
平和的事 有好消息吗
Peaceful thoughts... Do you have any good news?

169
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,918
喔 因为你不会变老 所以外貌不会改变
Well, you don't really age, so you'll pretty much look the same.

170
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,921
你能在过去停留的时间不多
You won't have much time in the past.

171
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,631
哨兵会找到我们
The Sentinels will find us.

172
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,049
每次都能
They always do.

173
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,843
这次我们将无路可逃
And this time, we won't be able to run.

174
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,553
只能坐以待毙
We'll have no escape.

175
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,890
这是最后的机会了
This is our last chance.

176
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:22,186
你确定这事能成
是啊 我相信他
You really think this will work?
I have faith in him.

177
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,229
我担心的不是他 是我们
It's not him I'm worried about, it's us.

178
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,856
年轻的我们
We were young...

179
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,524
还那么无知
we didn't know any better.

180
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,028
现在不会了
We will now.

181
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,405
回头见
See you all soon.

182
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,575
可能会有点疼
This might sting a little.

183
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,960
The first time

184
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:34,174
Ever I saw your face

185
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:36,843
喔
Whoa.

186
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:45,352
I thought the sun

187
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:47,938
Rose in your eyes

188
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:03,620
And the moon and the stars

189
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,545
Were the gifts you gave

190
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,088
我的天呐
Holy shit.

191
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,764
真回来了
It worked.

192
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,562
有事吗
Hey, what's going on?

193
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,772
格雯 快穿衣服
你们是谁
Gwen, get dressed.
Who the hell are you?

194
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:31,982
现在是什么情况
Hey, I don't know what's going on.

195
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,400
你的工作是
You're supposed to be

196
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,693
保护老板的女儿 而不是睡他
guarding the boss's daughter, not screwing her.

197
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,695
我没跟她睡
Well, I didn't sleep with her.

198
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,488
没有
没有
No?
No.

199
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,908
我是说 对 我跟她睡了很多次
I mean, yes, I slept with her many times.

200
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,243
吉米
Jimmy!

201
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,829
不过那个人不是我 那是过去的我
That wasn't me. That was the old me.

202
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,582
我刚来到这里 还不到20秒
I just got here 20 seconds ago.

203
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:49,666
是吗
Really?

204
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,751
那你的衣服呢
Then what happened to your clothes?

205
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,377
我的 哦
My-- Oh.

206
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,421
如果说我是从未来来的
Would you believe me if I told you

207
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,006
你信吗
I was sent here from the future?

208
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,507
啊
Huh?

209
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,343
出去 亲爱的
好吧
Get out of here, sweetheart.
Yeah.

210
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,262
我们来解决这家伙
算了吧
We're gonna take care of this comedian.
No, you're not.

211
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,556
你是想把你的车钥匙和汽油钱给我
You're gonna give me the keys to your car and some money for gas...

212
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,849
还是想进医院
or you're gonna wake up in the hospital.

213
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,726
相信我 这事我见多了
Trust me, I know how these things play out.

214
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,436
因为你来自未来
Oh. Because you're from the future?

215
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,562
不
No.

216
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,355
是因为这玩意
Because of these.

217
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,151
什么情况
What the hell?

218
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,783
见鬼
God damn it!

219
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,683
想想平和的事
Peaceful thoughts.

220
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:09,037
吉米 雷蒙是怎么了
Jimmy! What happened to Ramon?

221
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,289
你为什么一直胡言乱语
And why are you talking crazy talk?

222
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,749
听着 嗯
格雯
Look, uh...
Gwen.

223
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,585
格雯 你将想低调行事几天 好吗
Gwen, you're gonna wanna lay low for a few days, all right?

224
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,087
从现在开始
Starting now.

225
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,171
好了 出去
Come on, out.

226
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,257
快走
Go.

227
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,433
嗯哼
Hmm.

228
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:36,106
今天 第18旅将从西贡撤离
Today, the 18th MP Brigade is departing from Saigon,

229
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,151
这是最后一支离开越南的美国军队
marking the last American troops to leave Vietnam.

230
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,903
显然战争结束了
and effectively ending the war.

231
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,033
国防支出正在接受重新审查
We are reviewing all of our defense expenditures...

232
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,244
所有灰色支出都将公布于众
and all the black books are being opened.

233
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:53,206
我们不会为威胁人民安全的武器提供资金
We can't support a weapon that targets our own citizens.

234
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,916
如果变种人像你说的
If these mutants, as you describe...

235
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,419
已经生活在我们当中
are already living among us...

236
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,421
这说明我们能够和平共处
then they are living here peacefully.

237
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,173
过去的10年我们一直相安无事
We haven't had an incident in over 10 years.

238
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,591
你忘了古巴的事了
After what happened in Cuba?

239
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,050
那件事从没被证实
That was never confirmed.

240
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,428
现在我们真正的敌人不是他们
We have very real enemies out there...

241
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:07,929
是俄国人和中国人
the Russians, the Chinese.

242
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:11,099
现在我们说的这些人在总人口中所占的
We are talking about a tenth of a tenth...

243
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,310
比例少之又少
of a tenth of our population.

244
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,812
请允许我念一份资料给各位听
Allow me to read something to you.

245
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,022
请吧
Please.

246
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:19,983
这份资料来自于中情局
This was acquired by our friends at the CIA.

247
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,401
是牛津大学一个变种人所
It's a dissertation...

248
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:25,238
撰写的论文
written by a mutant at Oxford University.

249
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,407
文章说
And I quote...

250
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,743
在尼安德特人眼里
"To Homo Neanderthalensis...

251
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,120
他的变种表亲 现代智人
"his mutant cousin, Homo Sapiens..."

252
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,914
也就是我们
which is us...

253
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,082
是一种畸形
"was an aberration.

254
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:39,377
变异人种现代智人出现后
"The arrival of the mutated human species, Homo Sapiens...

255
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:43,882
随之而来的是其低级同类 也就是尼安德特人的迅速灭亡
"was followed by the immediate extinction of their less evolved kin."

256
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:45,508
好了
Well...

257
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:50,513
现在 我们就是尼安德特人
Now, we are the Neanderthal.

258
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,432
只有你吧 崔斯克博士
Speak for yourself, Dr. Trask.

259
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,312
你们把士兵漂洋过海送上战场
You know, when you sent our soldiers to Vietnam...

260
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,105
却不给他们致胜武器
without the weapons they needed to win the war...

261
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,191
因为上一次你们低估了对手
you underestimated your enemy.

262
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:04,653
如果这次还这样
You do that with this enemy...

263
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:05,904
嗯
Mmm...

264
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,990
那就不是地球另一边的边境冲突了
and it won't be some border skirmish halfway around the world.

265
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,326
这次的战场 将是我们的街道
This time, the war will be for our streets...

266
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,703
城市 家
our cities, our homes...

267
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,916
到那时 你们才发现我研究的必要性
and by the time you see the need for my program...

268
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,377
那就已经晚了
it will be too late...

269
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:25,173
你们的人生将会留下两次战败的烙印
and you will have lost two wars in one lifetime.

270
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,220
对不起 崔斯克博士
We are sorry, Dr. Trask...

271
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,973
你的哨兵计划
but your Sentinel Program...

272
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,600
到此为止了
it ain't gonna fly.

273
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:49,364
有事吗 上校
Can I help you, Colonel?

274
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,741
我是来给我们的士兵送行的
Just here to give our boys a proper send-off.

275
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:55,203
抱歉 长官 按照命令 这是隔离区
I'm sorry, sir, but we have orders. This is a quarantined area.

276
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,372
让开 士兵
Stand aside, soldier.

277
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,416
这是命令
That's an order.

278
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,551
全体立正
Atten-hut!

279
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:11,636
稍息
At ease.

280
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,328
这些是什么
What is all this?

281
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:37,996
这是血液检测报告
Lab reports, blood tests.

282
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,831
之后会整理装箱运回去
It's all getting packed up and shipped back.

283
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,041
运到哪里
Where is it going?

284
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:42,167
到他们去的地方
Same place they are.

285
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,252
崔斯克集团
Trask Industries.

286
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,380
走了 先生们
Let's go, gentlemen.

287
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,758
我带你们离开这个倒霉地
I'm taking you out of this shit show.

288
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,760
是要回家吗
Shipping home?

289
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:53,970
还不到时候
Not just yet.

290
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,181
那是干什么用的
What are you doing with those?

291
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:58,058
让你们的旅途安稳点
Something to make the ride a little smoother.

292
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,643
你们会被送到一家私立机构
I'm transferring you to a private facility...

293
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,146
再做几项检查
where we can run a few more tests.

294
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,195
你们不是军人
Your men are not military.

295
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:12,530
是私人机构
Private outfit.

296
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,491
我们被授权送还他们
We're authorized to remand these men.

297
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:15,700
嗯
Hmm.

298
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,872
他们理应回家
These troops are going home.

299
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,043
哦 上校 恐怕你无权过问这件事
Well, Colonel, I don't believe you have jurisdiction in this matter.

300
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,296
恐怕我有 孩子
I'm afraid I do, son.

301
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,589
不好意思 你是谁
I'm sorry, who are you?

302
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,883
少校 你应该问
The question is, Major...

303
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,138
你是谁
...who are you?

304
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,643
瑞雯
Raven!

305
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,437
我不叫那名字
That's not my name.

306
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,027
我能解决
I had that.

307
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:34,279
我知道
I know.

308
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,074
我们撤 快 动作快
Let's move out. Come on, let's go.

309
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,409
埃瑞克呢
Where's Erik?

310
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:40,660
我现在单干了
I'm on my own now.

311
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,415
我们走 快点
Let's go! Move it!

312
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,727
让飞机等一下
Hold that plane!

313
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:09,063
不能把这些小伙子丢在这个无药可救的国家
Wouldn't wanna leave these boys in this godforsaken country.

314
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,231
是 长官
Yes, sir.

315
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,775
你不跟我们走吗
You're not coming with us, are you?

316
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,611
战斗还没结束
My war's not over.

317
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:16,321
敌人还没有消灭
The enemy is still out there.

318
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:41,513
那四个二等兵去哪里了
The four privates, where did they go?

319
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,515
去停机坪了
They were headed towards the tarmac.

320
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,658
有事吗
Can I help you?

321
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:46,536
这里的学校怎么了
Uh... Yeah, what happened to the school?

322
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:49,664
学校关了好几年了 你是家长吗
The school's been shut for years. Are you a parent?

323
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,458
最好别是 你是谁
I sure as hell hope not. Who are you?

324
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,669
汉克 汉克·麦考伊
I'm Hank. Hank McCoy.

325
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,838
我照看这房子
I look after the house now.

326
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,881
你是野兽
You're Beast?

327
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:01,384
难以置信 大器晚成啊
Look at you. I guess you're a late bloomer.

328
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:02,635
我听不懂你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about,

329
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,304
我得请你离开
but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

330
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:06,139
教授在哪里
So where's the Professor?

331
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,473
这里没有教授
There's no professor here.

332
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:09,684
瞧你瘦削的 还挺有力气
You're pretty strong for a scrawny kid.

333
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:12,145
你的体内真的没有小野兽
You sure there's not a little Beast in there?

334
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,938
他不在这里
得了吧 野兽
No, he's not here.
Come on, Beast.

335
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,481
得了吧 小野兽
不行
Come on, Beastie.
No.

336
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,317
嘿
Hey!

337
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,069
学校已经关门了
I said the school's closed.

338
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:22,196
请你离开
除非你让我见教授
You need to leave.
Not until I see the Professor.

339
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,824
我都跟你说了 这里没有教授
There's no professor here, I told you that.

340
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:28,494
孩子 我们以后会成为好朋友
Look, kid. You and I are gonna be good friends.

341
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,707
只是你还不知道
You just don't know it yet.

342
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,753
教授
Professor!

343
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,093
教授
Professor!

344
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,777
汉克
Hank?

345
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,737
怎么回事
What's going on here?

346
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,239
教授
Professor?

347
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:06,616
请别这么叫我
Please don't call me that.

348
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:08,242
为什么 你认识这家伙
Why? You know this guy?

349
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:10,703
他看起来似乎有点眼熟
Yeah, he looks slightly familiar.

350
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,997
快从吊灯上下来 汉克
Get off the bloody chandelier, Hank.

351
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,209
你能走路
You can walk.

352
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:17,585
你洞察力真强
You're a perceptive one.

353
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,253
我以为埃瑞克
I thought Erik--

354
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,546
奇怪的是
Which makes it slightly perplexing that

355
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,507
你竟然没看见大门口的警示牌
you missed our sign on the way in.

356
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,841
这里是私人领地 我的朋友
This is private property, my friend.

357
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,052
我要麻烦他请你离开这里
I'm gonna have to ask him to ask you to leave.

358
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:27,595
这个
Well.

359
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,597
恐怕办不到
I'm afraid I can't do that...

360
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,643
因为我是被派来找你的
because, uh, I was sent here for you.

361
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,813
那你回去告诉派你来的人我很忙
Tell whoever it was that sent you that I'm busy.

362
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,023
这事有点复杂
That's gonna be a little tricky...

363
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:42,819
因为派我来的人 就是你
because the person who sent me was you.

364
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:43,986
什么
What?

365
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,655
50年后的你
About 50 years from now.

366
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,411
我就知道 相信我
I know. Stay with me.

367
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,996
50年后的未来 是这样吗
对
Like in the future, 50 years from now?
Yeah.

368
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,998
我从未来派你来这里
对
I sent you from the future?
Yeah.

369
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:57,709
一派胡言
Piss off.

370
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:01,504
如果你没丧失能力 就知道是真的
If you had your powers, you'd know I was telling the truth.

371
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:04,215
你怎么知道我丧失能力
How do you know I don't have my p--

372
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,050
你是谁
我说了
Who are you?
I told you.

373
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:07,593
中情局的
不是
Are you CIA?
No.

374
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:08,678
你在监视我
You've been watching me?

375
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,471
我了解你 查尔斯
I know you, Charles.

376
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,557
我们是多年的朋友
We've been friends for years.

377
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,684
我知道你的能力始于9岁那年
I know your powers came when you were 9.

378
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:17,562
我知道 当你脑子里开始充斥各种声音时
I know you thought you were going crazy when it started...

379
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,772
你以为自己要疯了
all the voices in your head.

380
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,399
直到12岁那年
And it wasn't until you were 12...

381
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:24,986
你终于明白 这些声音来自于其他人的大脑
that you realized all the voices were in everyone else's head.

382
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:27,363
还要我说吗
Do you want me to go on?

383
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,032
我从没跟人说过
I never told anyone that.

384
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:33,744
现在没有 不过 以后会
Not yet, no, but, you will.

385
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:36,414
你勾起了我的好奇心
All right, you've piqued my interest.

386
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,082
你要干嘛
What do you want?

387
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,334
我们得阻止瑞雯
We have to stop Raven.

388
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,589
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

389
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:47,508
我们需要你
We need your help.

390
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,806
如果是梦 我该醒了
I think I'd like to wake up now.

391
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,980
她跟这事有关系
What does she have to do with this?

392
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:06,861
你说
So you're saying...

393
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:09,155
他们窃取了瑞雯的能力 然后
they took Raven's power, and what?

394
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,699
使之武器化
They weaponized it?

395
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:12,867
对
Yep.

396
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,077
她很特别
She is unique.

397
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:17,163
是很特别 汉克
Yeah, she is, Hank.

398
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,249
起初 哨兵只是以变种人为目标
In the beginning, the Sentinels were just targeting mutants.

399
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,211
后来 它们开始识别普通人身上的变种基因
Then they began to identify the genetics in non-mutants...

400
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:27,965
那些可能会生出变种人后代的人
who would eventually have mutant children and grandchildren.

401
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:31,511
许多人类开始帮助我们 但世界还是落入了
Many of the humans tried to help us, but it was a slaughter.

402
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:34,680
最残酷无情的人手里
leaving only the worst of humanity in charge.

403
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,807
我经历过很多战争
I've been in a lot of wars.

404
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,811
从没见过这么惨烈的
I'd never seen anything like this.

405
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,105
这一切都是因为她
And it all starts with her.

406
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:45,650
就算我们退一万步说
Let's just say for the sake of...

407
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:49,403
再退一万步说 就算我相信你
the sake, that I choose to believe you...

408
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,615
我决定帮你 瑞雯也不会听我的
that I choose to help you. Raven won't listen to me.

409
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:58,704
她的心 和灵魂都在别人那里
Her heart and soul belong to someone else now.

410
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,206
我知道
I know.

411
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,710
所以我们也需要万磁王
That's why we're gonna need Magneto, too.

412
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,338
埃瑞克
Erik?

413
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,048
你知道他在哪里吗
对
You do know where he is?
Yeah.

414
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,429
能再说一遍吗
Could you give me that one more time, please?

415
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:16,597
你听到了
You heard me.

416
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,145
他在他该在的地方
He's where he belongs.

417
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,690
你打算就这么走了
You're just gonna walk out?

418
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:28,401
你的洞察力真的很强 我给你一百分
Ooh, top marks. Like I said, you are perceptive.

419
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,319
我认识的教授 绝不会丢下
The Professor I know would never turn his back...

420
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,405
走投无路的人
on someone who'd lost their path.

421
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:34,574
更不用说他爱的人
Especially someone he loved.

422
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:38,327
知道吗
You know...

423
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,663
我好像想起你了
I think I do remember you now.

424
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,875
对 高大暴躁发型矫情的家伙
Yeah. Tall, angry fellow with the contentious hair.

425
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,878
当年我们去找过你 求你帮忙
We came to you a long time ago... seeking your help.

426
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:52,174
你当时对我们说的话 我现在奉还
And I'm gonna say to you what you said to us then.

427
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,136
去你的
Fuck off.

428
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:56,887
听着 你这混蛋
Listen to me, you little shit.

429
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:00,474
我这一路走来 见过无数人死去
I've come a long way, and I've watched a lot of people die.

430
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,310
有好人 有朋友
Good people. Friends.

431
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,853
你再这么自暴自弃
If you're gonna wallow in self-pity...

432
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:05,813
无所作为 你也会见到这些
and do nothing, then you're gonna watch the same thing...

433
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,565
明白吗
you understand?

434
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,322
人都有一死
We all have to die sometime.

435
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,037
告诉过你 这里没有教授了
Told you there was no professor here.

436
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,124
他到底怎么了
What the hell happened to him?

437
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,047
他失去了一切
He lost everything.

438
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,633
埃瑞克 瑞雯
Erik, Raven...

439
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,593
和他的双腿
his legs.

440
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,638
我们建起学校 实验室 和这里的一切
We built the school, the labs, this whole place...

441
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:42,558
可是第一学期结束时
then, just after the first semester...

442
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:44,310
越南战场形势告急
the war in Vietnam got worse.

443
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:46,896
许多老师
Many of the teachers...

444
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:49,899
和学生被强征入伍
and older students were drafted.

445
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,609
他崩溃了
It broke him.

446
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,403
变得抑郁孤僻
He retreated into himself.

447
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,822
我想帮帮他
I wanted to help, do something...

448
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,033
所以我用帮我控制变身的配方
so I designed a serum to treat his spine...

449
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,245
发明了一种血清治疗他的脊椎
derived from the same formula that helps me control my mutation.

450
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:07,208
我只用少量 以保持身体稳定
I take just enough to keep myself balanced...

451
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,336
可他用得太多了
but he takes too much.

452
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:12,755
我想让他戒掉
I tried easing him back...

453
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:16,425
他忍受不了疼痛 和那些声音
but he just couldn't bear the pain, the voices.

454
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:19,053
治疗让他的腿能够继续使用
The treatment gives him his legs...

455
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,722
可这不够
but it's not enough.

456
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:22,932
他
He's...

457
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,228
他失去的太多了
He's just lost too much.

458
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,076
你不害怕我
You're not scared of me?

459
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:46,163
我一直相信这样的人不只我一个
I always believed I couldn't be the only one in the world.

460
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,207
我叫查尔斯·艾克斯维尔
Charles Xavier.

461
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:52,086
我叫瑞雯
Raven.

462
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,172
你饿了吧 就你一个人
You're hungry and alone.

463
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,007
你可以随便拿
Take whatever you want.

464
00:36:57,091 --> 00:37:00,010
我们有很多食物 你不用偷
We've got lots of food. You don't have to steal.

465
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,221
其实
In fact...

466
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,890
你永远都不用再偷了
you never have to steal again.

467
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:07,226
真的 我向你保证
And that's a promise.

468
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:14,817
我帮你找她
I'll help you get her.

469
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:19,697
不是为了你的狗屁未来 我是为了她
Not for any of your future shite, but for her.

470
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:21,031
行啊
Fair enough.

471
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,326
可你并不了解埃瑞克
But I'll tell you this. You don't know Erik.

472
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:27,121
那家伙是怪物 是凶手
That man is a monster. A murderer.

473
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,999
你觉得你能说服瑞雯回心转意
You think you can convince Raven to change?

474
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,208
让她回家
To come home?

475
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,043
很好
That's splendid.

476
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,464
可是你为什么认为你能够改变埃瑞克呢
But what makes you think you can change him?

477
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,217
是你和埃瑞克一起派我来的
Because you and Erik sent me back here together.

478
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,555
他们用来关押他的房子
The room they're holding him in

479
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:45,931
建于二战期间
was built during the Second World War...

480
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:47,641
那时钢铁短缺
when there was a shortage of steel.

481
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:51,562
所以地基完全是由混凝土和沙土构成 不含金属
So the foundation is pure concrete and sand. No metal.

482
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:52,813
他被关在
He's being held...

483
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,191
这个星球上守备最森严的这座建筑物的
a hundred floors beneath the most

484
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,568
地下100层
heavily guarded building on the planet.

485
00:37:57,735 --> 00:37:59,111
他怎么被关了
Why is he in there?

486
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,072
他没跟你说吗
What, he forgot to mention?

487
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,284
肯尼迪
Uh, JFK.

488
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:06,744
他杀了
He killed--

489
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:11,749
不然子弹怎么会奇迹般的在空中拐了个弯
What else explains a bullet miraculously curving through the air?

490
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,542
埃瑞克是操控枪支的高手
Erik's always had a way with guns.

491
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,336
你确定要这么做吗
Are you sure you want to carry on with this?

492
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:16,796
这是你的计划 不是我的
This is your plan, not mine.

493
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,964
我们目前还没有渠道能够进去
We don't have any resources to get us in.

494
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:20,716
或者出来
Or out.

495
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,135
我们没有帮手
It's just me and Hank.

496
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:24,553
我认识个人
I knew a guy.

497
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:26,180
他现在应该还很年轻
Yeah, he'd be a young man now.

498
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:29,642
在特区外长大
Grew up outside of D.C.

499
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,310
他能进入任何地方
He could get into anywhere.

500
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:34,021
可我不知道去哪里找他
I just don't know how the hell we're gonna find him.

501
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:38,025
主脑不在考虑范围内 是吧
Is Cerebro out of the question?

502
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:39,902
但愿你们有互联网就好了
If only you guys had Internet.

503
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,406
什么是互联网
What's "Internet?"

504
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,495
可以查电话
We have a phonebook.

505
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,170
我还以为您准备出差去了 先生
I thought you'd be getting ready for your trip, sir.

506
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,256
我回来取几份文件
I just came to grab a couple files.

507
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:03,801
新买的围巾 真漂亮
Is that a new scarf? It's nice.

508
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,094
谢谢
Thank you.

509
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,436
崔斯克博士
Dr. Trask?

510
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,520
请稍等
One second.

511
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,731
哦
Oh.

512
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,609
出席巴黎会议的人增加了
We added some names to the Paris meeting.

513
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,364
谢谢
Thank you.

514
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,866
出什么事了吗 先生
Is something wrong, sir?

515
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,953
没事 没事
No. It's nothing.

516
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,872
能麻烦你把我的行程打出来吗
Would you mind typing up my itinerary?

517
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,041
我不想忘了什么
I don't wanna miss anything.

518
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:08,842
这里 这里 这里
哪里
- Here, here, here.
- Where?

519
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,386
在这里停车
随便 都好
Just stop here.
All right, all right.

520
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,638
下次我来开 别习惯了
Next time I'm driving. Don't get used to it.

521
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,116
他又犯事了
What's he done now?

522
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,909
不管他拿了什么 我这就开支票
I will just write you a check for whatever he took.

523
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:35,369
我们只想跟他谈谈
We just need to talk to him.

524
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:42,251
彼得 是警察 他们又来了
Peter! The cops are here. Again.

525
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,426
我是公主 你是谁
I'm a princess. What are you?

526
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,805
我是金刚狼
I'm the Wolverine.

527
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:56,724
你的哥哥在哪里
Where's your brother?

528
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:02,438
上楼 烦你的姐姐去
Go upstairs and bug your sister.

529
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:04,106
是她在折磨我
But she bugs me!

530
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:14,700
你们想干嘛
What do you guys want?

531
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:17,536
我什么也没干 一直在这里
I didn't do anything. I've been here all day.

532
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:20,622
别紧张 彼得 我们不是警察
Just relax, Peter. We're not cops.

533
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:21,832
当然不是
Of course you're not. If you were,

534
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,000
警察怎么会开短租车
you wouldn't be driving a rental car.

535
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:24,168
你怎么会知道
How did you know we've got a rental car?

536
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:26,170
你进门的时候 我看了你的驾照
I checked your registration when you were walking to the door.

537
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:27,254
顺便
I also had some time to kill

538
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,338
看了你的租车合同
so I went through your rental agreement.

539
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,591
发现你们是从镇外来的 是FBI
Saw you were from out of town. Are you FBI?

540
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,677
不是警察 天才青少年学校是什么
No, you're not cops. Hey, what's with this gifted youngsters place?

541
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:36,180
那是 以前的名片
That's an old card.

542
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:39,433
他太神奇了
他太讨厌了
He's fascinating.
He's a pain in the arse.

543
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,768
是瞬移吗
What, a teleporter?

544
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,019
动作快而已
No, he's just fast.

545
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:44,563
我认识他时 他没这么 年轻
And when I knew him he wasn't so... young.

546
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,232
年轻 是你太老了
Young? You're just old.

547
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,110
你不害怕展示你的能力
So you're not afraid to show your powers?

548
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:51,612
能力 你说什么能力
What powers? What are you talking about?

549
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:54,072
有什么不正常的吗
Do you see something strange here?

550
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,367
就算说出去 也不会有人相信
Nothing anybody would believe if you told them.

551
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:03,040
你们是谁 想干嘛
So, who are you? What do you want?

552
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,792
想请你帮个忙 彼得
干什么
We need your help, Peter.
For what?

553
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:07,002
入侵一个高度戒备的地方
To break into a highly secured facility...

554
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,712
带一个人出来
and to get someone out.

555
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:09,922
劫狱
Prison break?

556
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:11,757
那可是犯法的
That's illegal, you know.

557
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:13,050
呃
Um...

558
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:17,971
除非他们抓到你
Well, only if you get caught.

559
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,181
我有什么好处
So, what's in it for me?

560
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:22,643
一个行窃惯犯 成功突破五角大楼
You, you kleptomaniac, get to break into the Pentagon.

561
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:30,234
凭什么相信你们
How do I know I can trust you?

562
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:32,736
因为我们是同类
Because we're just like you.

563
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,240
让他看看
Show him.

564
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,087
挺酷 就是有点恶心
That's cool, but it's disgusting.

565
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:56,718
五角大楼建于1943年 是世界最大的办公大楼
Built in 1943, the Pentagon is the world's largest office building...

567
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,515
占地600万平方英尺
stretched over six million square feet.

568
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:02,599
卫生间在哪里
Where's the bathroom?

569
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,519
他一直要方便
He always needs to pee!

570
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,751
监控都变成电视节目了 怎么回事
Yeah, we're getting broadcast signal down here. What's going on?

571
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,669
见鬼 打电话给维修部
Damn it, call Maintenance, get them down here.

572
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,395
从日本人手中夺取了硫磺岛
...fought for and captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Japanese Empire.

573
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:55,439
在这场历时一个月的战役中
Now, this month-long battle...

574
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,149
发生了二战太平洋战场

最激烈的战斗

576
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:16,960
再过3秒 这扇门就会打开
In three seconds, those doors are going to open...

577
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:19,463
会有20个警卫朝我们射击
and 20 guards will be here to shoot us.

578
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,299
我知道 等的就是这个
I know. That's what I'm waiting for.

579
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:23,467
你在干什么
What are you doing?

580
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,218
托住你的脖子 防止猛扭
I'm holding your neck so you don't get whiplash.

581
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:26,303
什么
What?

582
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:28,638
猛扭
Whiplash.

583
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:34,478
不许动
Don't move!

584
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:50,744
没事的 过会就好了
You're good, it'll pass.

585
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:51,995
大家都这样
It happens with everyone.

586
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:56,666
你犯的事一定不小
You must have done something pretty serious.

587
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:58,210
你干了什么
What did you do, man?

588
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,795
干了什么
What did you do?

589
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:01,588
干了什么 让他们兴师动众
What did you do? Why'd they have you in there?

590
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:03,465
刺杀了总统
For killing the President.

591
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:07,427
哇 啊
Ah. Wow. Shit.

592
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,888
我唯一的罪名
The only thing I'm guilty of

593
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,556
是为我们的同胞而战
is fighting for people like us.

594
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,600
会空手道吗 空手道知道吗
You take karate? You know karate, man?

595
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:15,811
我不知道什么是空手道
I don't know karate.

596
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,229
可我知道什么是疯子
But I know crazy.

597
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,233
女士们先生们 小伙们姑娘们 现在进入红色戒备状态
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this is a Code Red situation.

598
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:23,318
我和我的助手
We are evacuating the entire floor...

599
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,113
正在疏散整个楼层
so that my associate and I...

600
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:27,823
这样我们才能控制监狱的出口
can, uh, secure the prison.

601
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:29,407
你们是谁
Who are you?

602
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:31,076
我们是特别行动组 中央
We're special operations, CB...

603
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:32,494
联邦 情报调查局
FB-CID.

604
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:35,413
我刚才说的话 你们也许没听进去
Perhaps you didn't hear me when first I spoke...

605
00:48:35,497 --> 00:48:37,332
可这事关重大
but it is imperative that you understand...

606
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,959
要知道这里现在已经被完全封锁了
we're in a complete lockdown situation.

607
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:40,710
你们现在得去三楼
We have to get you to the third floor--

608
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,803
不好意思 你说完了吗
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you finished?

609
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:56,893
他们说你能操纵金属
They told me you control metal.

610
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:58,478
他们
"They"?

611
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,651
知道吗 我妈以前认识个人 也能操纵金属
You know, my mom once knew a guy who could do that.

612
00:49:07,237 --> 00:49:10,157
对不起 我这个人不是很提倡暴力
I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with violence.

613
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:14,536
查尔斯
Charles?

614
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:23,170
很高兴见到你 老朋友
Good to see you too, old friend.

615
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:24,462
你能走了
And walking.

616
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:26,047
与你无关
No thanks to you.

617
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:29,968
我今天最没预料见到的人就是你
You're the last person in the world I expected to see today.

618
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:31,428
相信我
Believe me...

619
00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:33,263
不是迫不得已 我也不会来
I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to.

620
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:35,599
我救你出去 你就得听我的
If we get you out of here, we do it my way.

621
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:36,766
不许杀人
No killing.

622
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:38,185
没有头盔
No helmet.

623
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,770
我不想听你的也不行
I couldn't disobey you even if I wanted.

624
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:43,481
我再也不会进入你脑子了
I'm never getting inside of that head again.

625
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,776
我要你发誓 埃瑞克
I need your word, Erik.

626
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,114
都别动
Nobody move!

627
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,617
站在原地别动
Hold it right there!

628
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,329
查尔斯
不许动
Charles.
Don't move.

629
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,497
举起手来 不然我们就开枪了
Hands up, or we will shoot!

630
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,291
定住他们 查尔斯
我做不到
Freeze them, Charles.
I can't.

631
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:02,667
把手举起来
Hands up!

632
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:08,423
不
No!

633
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:25,523
If I could save time in a bottle

634
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:31,696
The first thing that I'd like to do

635
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,407
Is to save every day

636
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:38,286
Till eternity passes away

637
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,331
Just to spend them with you

638
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:46,836
If I could make days last forever

639
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:51,508
If words could make wishes come true

640
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:55,679
I'd save every day

641
00:50:55,762 --> 00:50:58,598
Like a treasure and then

642
00:50:58,682 --> 00:51:03,061
Again, I would spend them with you

643
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,898
But there never seems to be enough time

644
00:51:06,982 --> 00:51:09,401
To do the things you want to do

645
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:12,153
Once you find them

646
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:17,367
I've looked around enough to know

647
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:22,163
That you're the one I want to go through time with

648
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:03,246
谢了 孩子
Thanks, kid.

649
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:09,961
彼得 真的非常感谢你
Peter, thank you very, very much.

650
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:11,129
多保重
You take care.

651
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,547
我看了座舱里的飞行计划
Hey, I saw your flight plan in the cockpit.

652
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,631
你们为什么要去巴黎
Why are you going to Paris?

653
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:27,020
如果你的爪子是金属的
Imagine if they were metal.

654
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:30,190
帮我把车还了
好的
Do me a favor and return it for me.
Okay.

655
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:31,608
彼得
And, Peter?

656
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:33,360
开慢点
Take it slow.

657
00:52:34,486 --> 00:52:36,363
他们在哪里找到你的
Where did they dig you up?

658
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,949
你会觉得难以置信
You're gonna find this hard to believe...

659
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:42,952
是你派我来的
but, uh, you sent me.

660
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,288
你和查尔斯
You and Charles.

661
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:47,040
未来的你们
From the future.

662
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:11,648
怎么失去能力的
How did you lose them?

663
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:14,067
治疗脊椎的药物影响我的DNA
The treatment for my spine affects my DNA.

664
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:19,406
你为了走路 牺牲自己的能力
You sacrificed your powers so you could walk?

665
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,410
牺牲能力是为了睡个好觉
I sacrificed my powers so that I could sleep.

666
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,996
你懂什么
What do you know about it?

667
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:28,415
我也付出了很多代价
I've lost my fair share.

668
00:53:28,498 --> 00:53:29,499
呵
Ha.

669
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:31,668
得了吧 埃瑞克
Dry your eyes, Erik.

670
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,503
这弥补不了你干过的事
It doesn't justify what you've done.

671
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:35,338
你根本不知道我干过什么
You have no idea what I've done.

672
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:37,173
我知道你夺走了我最重要的东西
I know that you took the things that mean the most to me.

673
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:39,759
也许你早该好好保护它们
Well, maybe you should have fought harder for them.

674
00:53:39,843 --> 00:53:41,136
如果你想打架的话 埃瑞克
If you want a fight, Erik...

675
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:42,762
坐下
那我跟你打
- Sit down.
...I will give you a fight!

676
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:43,972
让他来
Let him come.

677
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:45,807
你抛下了我
You abandoned me!

678
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,100
夺走了她
You took her away...

679
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:48,268
还抛下了我
and you abandoned me!

680
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:49,853
萨尔瓦多天使
Angel.

变种人兄弟姐妹

685
00:53:58,361 --> 00:53:59,821
全都死了

686
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:03,783
还有无数变种人
Countless others...

687
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:04,909
被实验
experimented on.

688
00:54:04,993 --> 00:54:06,035
被杀戮
Butchered!

689
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:07,120
埃瑞克
Erik!

690
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:08,329
那时候你在哪里 查尔斯
Where were you, Charles?

691
00:54:08,705 --> 00:54:10,999
我们应该好好保护他们
We were supposed to protect them!

692
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:13,877
你的同胞需要你的时候你在哪里
Where were you when your own people needed you?

693
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,129
躲起来了 你和汉克
Hiding! You and Hank!

694
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:18,298
把自己伪装起来了
Pretending to be something you're not!

695
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:20,258
埃瑞克
Erik!

696
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:24,637
你抛下了我们所有人
You abandoned us all.

697
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,993
原来你一直这么混蛋
So, you were always an asshole.

698
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:52,123
我猜我们在未来是好兄弟
I take it we're best buddies in the future.

699
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,126
很多年以来
I spent a lot of years

700
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:56,920
我一直想打倒你
trying to bring you down, bub.

701
00:54:57,504 --> 00:54:59,255
结果怎么样
How does that work out for you?

702
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:01,132
你跟我一样
You're like me.

703
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,052
是幸存者
You're a survivor.

704
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,432
能收拾一下吗
Do you wanna pick all that shit up?

705
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:32,830
将军 你得少喝点 明天还有重要活动

706
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:39,504
我们在庆祝 队长 不是每天都能打赢战争 尤其是美国这个敌人

707
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,341
我去再拿一瓶

708
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,442
对不起

709
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:04,612
我相信是我的过失

710
00:56:04,988 --> 00:56:06,406
你会说越南语

711
00:56:06,656 --> 00:56:07,740
我是同声传译

712
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:12,245
会说许多语言

713
00:56:12,996 --> 00:56:15,164
让我替你再买一瓶

714
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,584
除非有人陪你来的

715
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:20,628
就我自己

716
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,173
再来一瓶尊尼获加

717
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:41,608
你要出席明天的峰会

718
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:51,701
关心政治的美女

719
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,370
外表是会骗人的

720
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:56,247
女人

721
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,251
多展示点 宝贝
Show me more, baby?

722
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:04,631
衣服脱掉
Clothes off?

723
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:21,105
怎么了 宝贝 觉得我这样不美吗
What's the matter, baby? You don't think I look pretty like this?

724
00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:10,446
下一盘吗 好久不下了
Fancy a game? It's been a while.

725
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:12,281
我没兴趣 谢谢
I'm not in the mood for games, thank you.

726
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:22,083
我已经10年没有碰过酒了
I haven't had a real sip in ten years.

727
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:36,222
总统不是我杀的
I didn't kill the President.

728
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,308
子弹变道了 埃瑞克
The bullet curved, Erik.

729
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:40,977
因为我想要救他
Because I was trying to save him.

730
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,063
可他们把我抓走了
They took me out before I could.

731
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,273
你为什么要救他
Why would you try and save him?

732
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:47,984
他是我们的一员
Because he was one of us.

733
00:58:59,162 --> 00:59:01,581
你一定觉得我很蠢
You must think me so foolish.

734
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,168
你总说他们会找上门来
We've always said they would come after us.

735
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:08,671
我没想过他们会利用瑞雯的DNA
I never imagined they'd use Raven's DNA to do it.

736
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:10,840
你上次见她是什么时候
When did you last see her?

737
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,387
我去达拉斯那天
The day I left for Dallas.

738
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,681
她怎么样
And how was she?

739
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:21,684
坚强
Strong.

740
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,561
专注
Driven.

741
00:59:24,729 --> 00:59:25,772
忠诚
Loyal.

742
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:28,608
她 她好吗
How... How was she?

743
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:31,527
她
She was...

744
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:35,031
我们
We were...

745
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:40,870
我理解你为什么这么看重她
I could see why she meant so much to you.

746
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:45,124
你该为她骄傲 查尔斯
You should be proud of her, Charles.

747
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:48,586
她在为我们的事业战斗
She's out there fighting for our cause.

748
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:50,129
是你的事业
Your cause.

749
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:53,716
我抚养长大的女孩不会杀人
The girl I raised was not capable of killing.

750
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:55,384
不是抚养 你们一起长大
You didn't raise her, you grew up with her.

751
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:57,595
她不可能永远是个小女孩 所以她走了
She couldn't stay a little girl forever, that's why she left.

752
00:59:57,762 --> 01:00:00,640
她走 是因为你给她灌输了你的思想
She left because you got inside her head.

753
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:04,560
我没那种能力
That's not my power.

754
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:07,897
这是她的选择
She made a choice.

755
01:00:08,064 --> 01:00:10,900
现在我们知道她选择的后果了
But now we know where that choice leads, don't we?

756
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:12,485
她去刺杀崔斯克
She's going to murder Trask,

757
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:13,736
被他们抓住
they're going to capture her...

758
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:16,656
然后他们把我们斩尽杀绝
and then they're going to wipe us out.

759
01:00:16,823 --> 01:00:18,741
我们先找到她就能避免这些
Not if we get to her first.

760
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:22,161
只要明天我们改变历史
Not if we change history tomorrow.

761
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,335
对不起 查尔斯
I'm sorry, Charles...

762
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:34,757
以前的事情
for what happened.

763
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:36,926
真的很对不起
I truly am.

764
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:42,348
我好久没下棋了
It's been a while since I've played.

765
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:46,811
我会手下留情
I'll go easy on you.

766
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:50,606
那样对你公平一点
Might finally be a fair fight.

767
01:00:51,941 --> 01:00:53,317
那你先下吧
You have the first move.

768
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:10,167
今天 来自世界各国的外交官
The diplomats from all around the world

769
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:12,295
陆续抵达皇家大酒店
are arriving here today at the Hotel Royal.

770
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:13,880
今天 将载入史册
It's an historic day.

771
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:16,299
美国政府正式宣布
It's the, uh, official ending

772
01:01:16,382 --> 01:01:19,135
不再介入越南战争
of the United States' military involvement in Vietnam.

773
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,470
这是南越外交部部长
There we have the South Vietnamese Foreign Minister...

774
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:23,306
以及南越的其他政要
with other South Vietnamese dignitaries.

775
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:26,475
离峰会开始还有一个小时
The Summit doesn't begin for another hour.

776
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:28,185
我们在楼上为您的贵客
The hotel has arranged a private room

777
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:29,812
准备了一间专用房间
upstairs for your special guests.

778
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:31,939
时间足够了
That will be plenty of time.

779
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:40,031
下午好 诸位 感谢你们的到来
Good afternoon, everyone. Hello, thank you for coming.

780
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,825
祝贺你们赢得了这场战争
Congratulations on winning this war.

781
01:01:43,326 --> 01:01:45,453
我知道 你们一会都要下楼
Now, I know you all have hands to shake

782
01:01:45,536 --> 01:01:47,663
握握手 拍拍照
and photos to take downstairs...

783
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,874
所以 我就开门见山地说了
so I will get right to the point.

784
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,919
眼下出现了新的敌人
There is a new enemy out there.

785
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:55,588
在他们面前 你们的武器将失去作用
An enemy that will render your arsenals useless...

786
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:57,048
军队将失去力量
your armies powerless...

787
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,091
国家将失去自卫能力
and your nations defenseless.

788
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:08,726
要赢得这场战争 你们需要新武器 我将它们命名为哨兵
You will need a new weapon for this war. I call them Sentinels.

789
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:12,480
寓意是伫立在要塞大门外的
Named after the ancient guardians

790
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,440
古老守卫者
that stood at the gates of the citadel.

791
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:19,528
他们的飞行能力堪比鹞式战斗机
They have the aeronautic capabilities of a Harrier jet.

792
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:22,865
它们配备的枪械每分钟能发射
Armed with guns that can fire off...

793
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:27,036
超过2000发热塑性子弹
more than 2,000 rounds per minute of thermoceramic ammunition.

794
01:02:27,203 --> 01:02:29,705
更别提它们的规模 力量 速度
But size, power, speed--

795
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:31,791
即便是洛克希德或波音也达不到
you could find that at Lockheed or Boeing.

796
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:34,460
不过 哨兵真正的特别之处
No, what makes the Sentinels so special...

797
01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:38,089
在于它能够锁定变种人的基因
is the ability to target the mutant X-gene.

798
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,757
这套基因导航系统
A genetic guidance system

799
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:42,426
能在半英里外锁定目标
that can lock onto a mark a half a mile away.

800
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:45,596
只有在确定目标之后 才会发起攻击
It won't trigger unless it has identified the target.

801
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:47,598
有了这种武器
With this weapon, there will be

802
01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:49,308
人员附带损失将成为历史
no human collateral damage.

803
01:02:49,475 --> 01:02:52,311
就算我现在打开它 系统也不会启动
If I turn it on, the system couldn't even activate in here.

804
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:03,906
除非 这里有变种人
Unless there's a mutant.

805
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:15,167
它一定是出什么故障了
There has to be some kind of mistake.

806
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:19,463
我的发明从不出故障
My machines don't make mistakes.

807
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:23,300
你是什么
What are you?

808
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,012
我发誓我
I assure you...

809
01:03:28,097 --> 01:03:29,098
不 别开枪
No, don't shoot it.

810
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:31,017
我发誓
I assure you,

811
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,601
我真的 不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

812
01:04:07,053 --> 01:04:08,095
瑞雯
Raven!

813
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,394
瑞雯 瑞雯
Raven? Raven!

814
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:20,816
瑞雯
Raven?

815
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:24,153
查尔斯
Charles?

816
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,572
我们来找你了 我和埃瑞克一起
We've come for you, Erik and I.

817
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:27,740
来找你
Together.

818
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:30,910
我 我以为 再也 再也见不到你了
I never thought I'd see you again.

819
01:04:31,077 --> 01:04:33,329
很久以前我保证过
I made you a promise a long time ago

820
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:34,538
我会保护你的
that I would protect you.

821
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:43,339
金刚狼
Wolverine!

822
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:48,761
我是绝对不会让他们抓到你的
I'm going to keep you safe.

823
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:50,554
我是绝对不会让他们抓到你的
I'm going to keep you out of their hands.

824
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:55,851
埃瑞克
Erik?

825
01:04:57,019 --> 01:04:59,188
埃瑞克 你想干什么
Erik? What are you doing?

826
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:02,399
保护我们的未来
Securing our future.

827
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:04,527
原谅我 魔形女
Forgive me, Mystique.

828
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:07,363
只要你活着 我们就有危险
As long as you're out there, we'll never be safe.

829
01:05:08,531 --> 01:05:09,657
埃瑞克
Erik...

830
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,742
用你的能力 查尔斯 阻止他
Use your power, Charles. Stop him.

831
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:13,035
他做不到
He can't.

832
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:45,401
他在脱离那个时空
He's slipping back.

833
01:05:45,568 --> 01:05:46,777
我控制不住他
I'm losing him.

834
01:06:28,444 --> 01:06:29,486
史崔克
Stryker!

835
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:32,072
总有人会完成我的事业 金刚狼
Someone will finish what we've started, Wolverine!

836
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:33,199
总有一天
One day!

837
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:39,663
控制住他
Restrain him.

838
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:55,804
埃瑞克
Erik!

839
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:07,066
这是哪里
Where am I?

840
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:08,192
啊
Huh?

841
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:11,320
我怎么跑到这里的
How the hell did I get here?

842
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,072
什么 是你找我们的
What? You came to us.

843
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:15,324
你是谁
查尔斯
Who are you?
Charles.

844
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:16,992
查尔斯·艾克斯维尔
Charles Xavier!

845
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,077
我不认识你
I don't know you.

846
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,204
啊
那是什么东西
Huh?
What the hell is that?

847
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:23,707
冷静 冷静 这里交给我 你快去
Whoa. Whoa. Look, I can deal with this. Just go.

848
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:25,376
阻止埃瑞克
Stop Erik!

849
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:26,961
埃瑞克 不要
Erik, please...

850
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:28,170
对不起
I'm sorry.

851
01:07:28,337 --> 01:07:29,505
埃瑞克
Erik...

852
01:07:48,274 --> 01:07:50,567
你是罗根 他是汉克·麦考伊 我是查尔斯·艾克斯维尔
You're Logan, that's Hank McCoy, I'm Charles Xavier.

853
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:53,195
这几天你一直跟我们在一起
You spent the last couple of days with us.

854
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,200
你服迷幻药了
You're on acid.

855
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:03,080
有人给你强效迷幻药了吧
Somebody gave you really bad acid, yeah?

856
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,834
冷静
Just hold on tight,

857
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,127
我们一起想办法
we'll get through this together.

858
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:52,921
天啊 凯蒂
Oh, my God, Kitty.

859
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:56,091
她伤得很重
She's wounded pretty bad.

860
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:02,491
我控制住他了
I got him.

861
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:08,247
教授
Professor?

862
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:10,082
你怎么了
What happened to you?

863
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:13,001
我见到了一个以后会让我
I just saw someone who's gonna

864
01:10:13,085 --> 01:10:14,670
痛不欲生的人
bring me a lot of pain someday.

865
01:10:17,506 --> 01:10:18,507
瑞雯哪里去了
Where's Raven?

866
01:10:19,174 --> 01:10:20,426
跑了
什么
Gone.
What?

867
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:22,636
我们得走了
We have to get out of here.

868
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:25,097
我们想知道如果有关联的
We want to know if there's any sort of connection with--

869
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:33,313
昨天 一伙以前人们前所未见的不明歹徒
Yesterday, the Paris Peace Summit...

870
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,191
突然出现在巴黎会议现场
was rocked by the appearance of unidentified assailants...

871
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,652
全国上下陷入一片混乱
the likes of which the world has never seen.

872
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:41,488
大家都在问
Mass hysteria has gripped the nation as people ask...

873
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:43,907
他们来自哪里 他们还会再回来吗
"Where did they come from? Will they be back?"

874
01:10:44,074 --> 01:10:46,994
最关键的问题是 他们是敌是友
And most importantly, "Are they friend or foe?"

875
01:10:47,161 --> 01:10:49,538
以上是伦敦记者托比·艾略特
That was London correspondent Toby Elliot...

876
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:51,039
在巴黎会议现场为您带来的报道
reporting from the Paris Peace Summit yesterday.

877
01:10:51,123 --> 01:10:52,332
愚蠢
Fuck me.

878
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:57,546
这到底是什么情况 别做记录
What the hell are we dealing with here? Off the record.

879
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:01,717
两天前 一个叫埃瑞克·兰谢尔的男子
Two days ago, this man, Erik Lehnsherr...

880
01:11:01,884 --> 01:11:04,386
从五角大楼内最高警戒监狱逃脱
escaped from a maximum security prison inside the Pentagon.

881
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:06,388
我们认为这个女人
We believe that this woman

882
01:11:06,472 --> 01:11:08,265
是兰谢尔过去的帮手
is a former associate of Lehnsherr's.

883
01:11:08,599 --> 01:11:09,850
他们曾在1962年的
They were together in Cuba,

884
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:12,352
古巴导弹危机中出现过
day of the crisis in '62.

885
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:16,190
除此之外 兰谢尔还涉嫌刺杀肯尼迪总统
He was also implicated in Kennedy's assassination.

886
01:11:17,316 --> 01:11:18,692
那么那个怪物呢
What about that thing?

887
01:11:18,859 --> 01:11:20,360
我们不知道那是什么
We don't know what that thing is, sir.

888
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,821
确切地说 我们对他们一无所知
Actually, we really don't know what any of them are.

889
01:11:22,988 --> 01:11:25,532
不 我们知道
Yes. Yes, we do.

890
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:27,784
他们是变种人
They're mutants.

891
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:33,123
这个男人能控制金属
He has the power to control metal.

892
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,541
如果我没记错
Last I checked, that's what

893
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,126
你们的武器都是金属做的
most of your weapons were made of.

894
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:40,172
而这个女人 则能变成任何一个人
And she can transform into anyone.

895
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:43,133
变成将军 特勤人员
A general, a secret serviceman.

896
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,551
甚至是 你 总统先生
Even you, Mr. President.

897
01:11:45,219 --> 01:11:46,470
只要她想 她就能走进这间办公室
She could walk into this office...

898
01:11:46,637 --> 01:11:50,307
下达一个核攻击命令
and order a nuclear strike if she was in the mood.

899
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:52,059
而他们只是冰山一角
And that's only two of them.

900
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:55,229
那我们有什么对策 或者防御手段
Do we have any countermeasures? Any defense?

901
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:57,648
我就等你问这个问题
I was waiting for you to ask me that question.

902
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:01,735
他的项目还在实验阶段 而且严重违规
That's an experimental program, sir. Strictly off the books.

903
01:12:10,536 --> 01:12:13,205
你是不是想告诉我 对于这些变种人
You're telling me these mutants are out in the world...

904
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:15,832
我们最好的防御手段 是金属机器人
and our best defense are these giant metal robots?

905
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:18,043
很多变种人与我们外形相似
Many of the mutants look like us.

906
01:12:18,502 --> 01:12:20,671
但我的哨兵能分辨出来
My Sentinels can tell the difference.

907
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:23,215
我有8架样机可以使用
I have eight prototypes ready to go.

908
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:25,300
它们都由划时代的聚合物制成
They're built out of a space-age polymer,

909
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:27,052
不含一点金属成分
not an ounce of metal on them.

910
01:12:33,684 --> 01:12:35,018
那就办个展示会
I want to make a demonstration.

911
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:37,437
我要让世界知道 我们有能力保护大家
I want the world to know that we can protect them.

912
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:39,648
实施这个项目要多少钱
What do you need to get these things operational?

913
01:12:39,815 --> 01:12:41,358
我向议会申请过资金
I already gave that number to Congress.

914
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:44,278
很可惜被他们投票否决了
Unfortunately, they elected to shut me down.

915
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:47,030
要让它们动起来 只需要花一点小钱
It's going to cost a bit more to turn them on.

916
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:50,200
尽管开口
噢 还有一件事情
- Whatever you need.
- Oh, and one more thing.

917
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:53,787
如果能够抓到他们的话 我非常需要她
If we do manage to capture them, I would like her.

918
01:12:53,954 --> 01:12:55,872
当然 出于研究目的
For research purposes, of course.

919
01:12:56,123 --> 01:12:59,793
我不在乎你糟蹋谁 不是我就行
I don't care who you screw, as long as it's not me.

920
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:05,173
真可怕

921
01:13:06,341 --> 01:13:07,759
什么真可怕

922
01:13:08,343 --> 01:13:09,636
生来就是那副幅模样

923
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,846
可怕吗

924
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,473
你能想象

925
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:16,393
每次照镜子都能看到它看着你的感觉吗

926
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:20,230
是的 我能

927
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:25,110
你觉得她是从哪里来的

928
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,155
你觉得她有家人吗

929
01:13:29,823 --> 01:13:31,366
是的
Yes.

930
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:33,368
她有
She does.

931
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:23,126
只要让我看见一颗螺丝动了
If I see so much as a screw move,

932
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,212
我就把它插进你的脖子
I will jam this into your throat.

933
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,547
你怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

934
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:29,216
你教导有方
You taught me well.

935
01:14:29,383 --> 01:14:31,718
很久没这么亲密交流了
It's been a long time since we were this close.

936
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,596
我想你
I missed you.

937
01:14:34,763 --> 01:14:36,431
你想杀我
You tried to kill me.

938
01:14:36,598 --> 01:14:38,725
这样其他变种人才能活
So the rest of us could live.

939
01:14:40,227 --> 01:14:41,478
什么意思
What do you mean?

940
01:14:42,062 --> 01:14:44,064
我们收到了来自未来的消息
We received a message from the future.

941
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:46,149
你别想骗我
Don't lie to me.

942
01:14:46,775 --> 01:14:48,777
我从没骗过你 以后也不会
I never have, and I never will.

943
01:14:50,404 --> 01:14:52,823
人类会利用你的血液和基因
Humans use your blood, your genes,

944
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:55,283
制造出武器 将我们斩尽杀绝
to create a weapon that wipes us all out.

945
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,868
我只是做了为保护我们的
I was only doing what I thought

946
01:14:56,952 --> 01:14:58,912
未来而必须做的事情
necessary to secure our future.

947
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,372
你有什么理由能让我不
So what's to stop me from killing you

948
01:15:00,455 --> 01:15:02,249
割断你的喉咙保护我的未来
right now and securing my future?

949
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,418
没有
Nothing.

950
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:07,587
已经无所谓了
It doesn't matter anymore.

951
01:15:07,754 --> 01:15:10,590
他们有你的DNA 你的血滴在马路上
They have your DNA. Your blood was on the street.

952
01:15:11,258 --> 01:15:12,592
这些都怪谁
Whose fault was that?

953
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:15,679
怪我
Mine.

954
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:19,933
我见过他们的计划 武器制造早就开始了
I've seen their plans. They're creating a weapon.

955
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,019
现在他们得到了更进一步的关键
And now they have what they need to take it further.

956
01:15:25,313 --> 01:15:28,650
我们必须先发制人 趁我们还处在上风
We have to strike now, while we still hold the upper hand.

957
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:33,530
我看到太多朋友死了 埃瑞克
I've seen too many friends die, Erik.

958
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:37,868
我不想发动战争
I don't want a war.

959
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:39,786
我只想要凶手偿命
I only want the man who murdered them.

960
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:41,455
这就是战争
This is war.

961
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:45,125
你怎么了
What happened to you?

962
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:48,211
我不在的时候 你丧失自我了
Did you lose your way while I was gone?

963
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:52,299
你是查尔斯的瑞雯
Are you still Charles' Raven?

964
01:15:54,634 --> 01:15:57,053
还是魔形女
Or are you Mystique?

965
01:16:00,474 --> 01:16:02,017
崔斯克才是敌人
Trask is the enemy.

966
01:16:04,186 --> 01:16:06,229
杀了他一个还不够
Killing one man isn't enough.

967
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:07,981
对你来说永远不够
It never was for you.

968
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:10,567
再见 埃瑞克
Goodbye, Erik.

969
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,968
他怎么了
What happened?

970
01:16:37,052 --> 01:16:38,678
过来
还能走吗
Come on.
Can he walk?

971
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:40,013
他需要治疗
He needs his treatment.

972
01:16:40,514 --> 01:16:41,640
汉克 我能听见他们
Hank, I can hear them.

973
01:16:41,723 --> 01:16:42,849
我知道 没事的
I know. It's okay.

974
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:45,060
能让声音停下吗
我这就去拿
Can you make it stop?
I'll get them.

975
01:16:47,062 --> 01:16:48,188
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey.

976
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:50,023
振作一点
Pull yourself together.

977
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:51,691
末日还没到呢
It's not over yet.

978
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:56,238
这话你自己都不信
You don't believe that.

979
01:16:58,156 --> 01:16:59,533
你怎么知道
How do you know?

980
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:01,368
这里不行了
As these go...

981
01:17:03,078 --> 01:17:06,373
这里就恢复了
this comes back.

982
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,376
全部都回来了
They all come back.

983
01:17:14,548 --> 01:17:15,966
听着
Look.

984
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:18,385
我还在这里
I'm still here...

985
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:20,929
瑞雯还不知去向
and she's still out there.

986
01:17:23,098 --> 01:17:25,225
我们需要你帮忙 查尔斯
We need your help, Charles.

987
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:27,394
真正的你
Not like this. I need you.

988
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:31,106
没有你的能力 我们找不到瑞雯
We can't find Raven. Not without your powers.

989
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:37,070
你少打了一次 所以我增加了剂量
I added a little extra because you missed a dose.

990
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:43,910
查尔斯
Charles.

991
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:17,402
汉克 帮我个忙好吗
Hank, do me a favor.

992
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,405
扶我到书房去 好吗
Would you help me to my study, please?

993
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,162
来吧
Come on, I got you.

994
01:18:37,297 --> 01:18:39,591
你确定要这么做
Are you sure about this?

995
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:43,094
不能确定
Absolutely not.

996
01:18:49,643 --> 01:18:51,811
这真是不可思议
This creature is extraordinary.

997
01:18:53,021 --> 01:18:54,648
她的基因中也许能找到
Her genes could hold the key

998
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,775
变种的关键
to mutation itself.

999
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:57,942
还有吗
I need more.

1000
01:18:58,026 --> 01:19:00,862
从巴黎的街头刮下来的就这么多了
That's all they were able to scrape off the pavement in Paris.

1001
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:02,197
不只是血
More than blood.

1002
01:19:02,697 --> 01:19:04,491
我需要脑组织
I need brain tissue...

1003
01:19:04,658 --> 01:19:07,285
脊髓液 骨髓
spinal fluid, bone marrow.

1004
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:09,579
想象一下
Imagine...

1005
01:19:09,663 --> 01:19:11,206
哨兵能够根据目标进行
Sentinels that could transform,

1006
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:12,540
任意变形
adapt to any target.

1007
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:15,460
只要我能够抓到她
If I could just get my hands on her.

1008
01:19:15,627 --> 01:19:17,462
这姑娘能够让项目进度
This girl could leap

1009
01:19:17,545 --> 01:19:19,297
加快几年
the program forward years...

1010
01:19:19,464 --> 01:19:21,341
甚至几十年
decades into the future.

1011
01:19:22,676 --> 01:19:23,968
你儿子几岁 少校
How old is your son now, Major?

1012
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:26,388
杰森
Jason?

1013
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:28,556
就快10岁了 长得真快
He's coming up on ten now, if you can believe it.

1014
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,141
再过8年就是入伍的年龄了
Eight years from fighting age.

1015
01:19:30,392 --> 01:19:32,227
有多少人的儿子和兄弟
And how many of our sons and brothers

1016
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:34,062
是被装在尸体袋里运回来的
did we just ship home in body bags?

1017
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:36,189
是50000 还是55000
Maybe fifty, fifty-five thousand?

1018
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:37,816
还有我们的敌人呢
And how many more on the other side?

1019
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:41,194
在这之前
Never before...

1020
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:44,364
我们人类的历史上
in all of human history...

1021
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:49,202
还从来没有任何事情 能把全人类都团结在一起
has there been a cause which could unite us as a species.

1022
01:19:50,203 --> 01:19:52,539
现在有了
Until now.

1023
01:19:53,832 --> 01:19:55,834
你还真是痛恨变种人
You really hate, mutants, don't you?

1024
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,337
恰恰相反 我很欣赏他们
On the contrary, I rather admire them.

1025
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:00,588
欣赏他们的能力
The things they can do.

1026
01:20:02,257 --> 01:20:05,218
我把他们视为人类的救星
I see mutants as our salvation.

1027
01:20:05,385 --> 01:20:06,553
也是人类的敌人
A common enemy.

1028
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:10,515
我们共同战斗 抵抗终极的敌人
A common struggle against the ultimate enemy.

1029
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:13,059
灭绝
Extinction.

1030
01:20:13,518 --> 01:20:14,519
我相信我们的新朋友
I believe our new friends...

1031
01:20:14,686 --> 01:20:17,063
将帮助我们进入一个新纪元 比尔
are going to help us usher in a new era, Bill.

1032
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:19,566
一个真正的
A new era of genuine...

1033
01:20:19,733 --> 01:20:22,485
持久的 和平的新纪元
and long-lasting peace.

1034
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:37,917
注意 注意
Attention, attention.

1035
01:20:38,001 --> 01:20:39,878
运输车将在两个小时后出发
Transport departure in two hours.

1036
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:44,048
重复 运输车将在两个小时后出发
Repeat. Transport departure in two hours.

1037
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:53,016
你上次下来是什么时候
When was the last time you were down here?

1038
01:20:53,224 --> 01:20:54,601
上次下来找学生的时候
The last time we went looking for students.

1039
01:20:54,893 --> 01:20:56,603
像是上辈子
A lifetime ago.

1040
01:21:02,484 --> 01:21:04,652
欢迎 教授
Welcome, Professor.

1041
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:30,345
瑞雯受伤了 应该走不远
Raven's wounded. She won't be moving fast.

1042
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:41,105
我已经很久没活动过这套筋骨了
These are muscles I haven't stretched in a long time.

1043
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:25,692
查尔斯
Charles!

1044
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:29,237
查尔斯
Charles!

1045
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:39,956
查尔斯 你还好吗 没事吧
Charles? It's all right.

1046
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:44,335
我去检查一下发电机
I'll go check the generator.

1047
01:22:52,093 --> 01:22:53,678
不是设备问题 对吗
It's not the machinery, is it?

1048
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:55,930
我做不到 我的脑子
I can't do this. My mind...

1049
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:57,265
你能做到
Yes, you can.

1050
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:59,183
我承受不了
你只是有些生疏
It won't take it.
You're just a little rusty.

1051
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:01,728
你不明白 不是生疏的问题
You don't understand. It's not a question of being rusty.

1052
01:23:01,895 --> 01:23:03,646
我能打开开关 我能扭动旋钮
I can flip the switches. I can turn the knobs.

1053
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:07,358
但我的力量来自这里 这里
But my power comes from here. It comes from--

1054
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:09,736
这里坏了
And it's broken.

1055
01:23:10,862 --> 01:23:12,780
我就像我的学生一样
I feel like one of my students.

1056
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:14,365
很无助
Helpless.

1057
01:23:15,742 --> 01:23:16,951
下来就是个错误
It was a mistake coming down here.

1058
01:23:17,118 --> 01:23:18,661
放埃瑞克出来就是个错误
It was a mistake freeing Erik.

1059
01:23:18,745 --> 01:23:21,122
这整件事就是个大错误
This whole thing has been one bloody mistake.

1060
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:23,708
对不起 罗根 他们不该派你回来
I'm sorry, Logan, but they sent back the wrong man.

1061
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:25,960
说得对
You're right.

1062
01:23:27,295 --> 01:23:28,796
不该是我
I am.

1063
01:23:29,714 --> 01:23:31,215
本该是你来的
Actually, it was supposed to be you.

1064
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:35,803
可只有我的身体能承受这趟旅行
But I was the only one who could physically make the trip.

1065
01:23:36,471 --> 01:23:37,597
我也
And, uh...

1066
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:39,515
不知道还能待多久
And I don't know how long I've got here.

1067
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:42,769
可我知道 很久以前
But I do know that a long time ago...

1068
01:23:43,394 --> 01:23:45,772
正确地说 是很久以后
actually, a long time from now...

1069
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:49,275
我曾是你最无助的学生
I was your most helpless student.

1070
01:23:49,734 --> 01:23:52,111
是你 解开了我的心结
And you unlocked my mind.

1071
01:23:52,278 --> 01:23:54,948
是你 告诉我我是谁
You showed me what I was.

1072
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:56,950
我能成为什么
You showed me what I could be.

1073
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,118
我不知道应该怎么帮助你
I don't know how to do that for you.

1074
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:01,245
你说得对 我不知道
You're right. I don't.

1075
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:05,166
但是有人知道
But I know someone who might.

1076
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:07,210
嗯哼
Hmm.

1077
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:10,254
进入我的大脑
Look into my mind.

1078
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:12,715
你看到我用主脑的后果了
You saw what I did to Cerebro.

1079
01:24:12,799 --> 01:24:14,050
你不想跟它一样吧
You don't want me inside your head.

1080
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:15,218
你什么都不做
There's no damage you can do...

1081
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:16,678
是伤害不了我的 放心吧
that hasn't already been done. Trust me.

1082
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:17,971
来吧
Come on.

1083
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,483
嗨
Hey.

1084
01:24:32,402 --> 01:24:33,444
嗨 罗根
Hey, Logan.

1085
01:24:33,528 --> 01:24:34,529
嗨 琴
Hi, Jean.

1086
01:24:34,988 --> 01:24:36,072
杀了我
Kill me.

1087
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:37,156
我爱你
I love you.

1088
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:44,914
你这个可怜的人
You poor, poor man.

1089
01:24:44,998 --> 01:24:46,165
跳过我的
Look past me.

1090
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:48,167
我不想要你的痛苦
No, I don't want your suffering.

1091
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:50,253
我不想要你的未来
I don't want your future!

1092
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:52,463
跳过我的未来
Look past my future.

1093
01:24:52,714 --> 01:24:54,841
看你的未来
Look for your future.

1094
01:24:58,344 --> 01:24:59,679
很好
That's it.

1095
01:25:00,054 --> 01:25:01,305
就这样
That's it.

1096
01:25:03,016 --> 01:25:04,350
继续
That's it.

1097
01:25:52,273 --> 01:25:54,233
查尔斯
Charles.

1098
01:25:56,069 --> 01:25:57,445
查尔斯
Charles.

1099
01:26:01,699 --> 01:26:04,077
这就是我们的结局
So this is what becomes of us.

1100
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:07,205
埃瑞克说得对
Erik was right.

1101
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,083
是我们心太软的下场
Humanity does this to us.

1102
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:12,877
除非我们能展现一个不同的未来
Not if we show them a better path.

1103
01:26:13,795 --> 01:26:15,463
你还不放弃
You still believe?

1104
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:18,091
人偶尔一次失足 迷失了方向
Just because someone stumbles, loses their way...

1105
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:21,094
不等于永远会迷失下去
it doesn't mean they're lost forever.

1106
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:25,473
有时候 我们只需要有人搭把手
Sometimes we all need a little help.

1107
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:28,101
我不是从前的我了
Oh, I'm not the man I was.

1108
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:32,313
我一使用能力
I open my mind...

1109
01:26:32,897 --> 01:26:35,108
它就会把我彻底压垮
and it almost overwhelms me.

1110
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:38,945
你在害怕 主脑能够感觉到
You're afraid, and Cerebro knows it.

1111
01:26:40,113 --> 01:26:42,657
那些声音实在是
All those voices...

1112
01:26:44,408 --> 01:26:49,080
实在是太痛苦了
so much pain.

1113
01:26:49,455 --> 01:26:52,792
你害怕的不是别人的痛苦
It's not their pain you're afraid of.

1114
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:54,961
是你自己的
It's yours, Charles.

1115
01:26:56,254 --> 01:26:58,756
痛苦虽然可怕
And as frightening as it may be...

1116
01:26:58,923 --> 01:27:01,759
却能够让你变得强大
that pain will make you stronger.

1117
01:27:02,093 --> 01:27:05,138
如果你能让自己感受它
If you allow yourself to feel it...

1118
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:07,014
接受它
embrace it...

1119
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:10,059
它将会让你变得
it will make you more powerful

1120
01:27:10,143 --> 01:27:12,353
超乎想象的强大
than you ever imagined.

1121
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,272
我们拥有的
It's the greatest

1122
01:27:14,355 --> 01:27:15,857
最强大的能力
gift we have...

1123
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:17,859
是坚强地承受
to bear their pain

1124
01:27:17,942 --> 01:27:19,861
他人的痛苦
without breaking.

1125
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:21,821
而这种能力来自
And it's born...

1126
01:27:21,988 --> 01:27:24,365
最具人性的力量
from the most human power.

1127
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:26,951
希望
Hope.

1128
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:38,379
拜托 查尔斯
Please, Charles...

1129
01:27:38,546 --> 01:27:42,508
我们需要你重拾希望
we need you to hope again.

1130
01:27:50,808 --> 01:27:53,269
找到你想要的了吗
Find what you were looking for?

1131
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:00,359
电力恢复了
The power's back on.

1132
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:01,819
是的
Yes.

1133
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:04,572
是恢复了
Yes, it is.

1134
01:29:44,964 --> 01:29:46,424
她失血过多
She's lost too much blood.

1135
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:48,384
不能再继续下去了
She can't keep going like this.

1136
01:29:48,551 --> 01:29:50,678
我们别无选择 鲍比
We have no choice, Bobby.

1137
01:29:50,845 --> 01:29:52,221
叫醒他就行了
不行
We can wake him up.
No!

1138
01:29:53,806 --> 01:29:55,099
他们还需要时间
They need more time.

1139
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:57,685
我刚才
I had...

1140
01:29:58,269 --> 01:30:00,271
看见了过去
a glimpse into the past.

1141
01:30:00,438 --> 01:30:01,814
如果我们现在叫醒他
If we wake Logan now...

1142
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:05,401
我们的命运将会走向更加黑暗的结局
we may set our fate on an even darker course.

1143
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,361
他们还需要时间
They need more time.

1144
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,574
还有一个变种人可以
There is someone else.

1145
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:13,409
不 没有变种人有凯蒂的能力
No, no one has Kitty's power.

1146
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:15,661
有一个能吸收她的能力的变种人
Someone that could take her power,

1147
01:30:15,745 --> 01:30:17,204
可以接替她
take her place.

1148
01:30:18,581 --> 01:30:19,874
她吸收过你的能力
She took yours once.

1149
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:20,958
小淘气
Rogue.

1150
01:30:21,042 --> 01:30:23,586
我很抱歉 鲍比 她已经死了
I'm sorry, Bobby, she must be dead.

1151
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:24,837
我已经很多年
I haven't been able to make

1152
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,255
没有联系到她了
a connection with her for years.

1153
01:30:26,339 --> 01:30:27,548
那是因为他们把她关押在
That's because they're keeping her

1154
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:29,675
你的大脑无法进入的
in the one place your mind can't reach

1155
01:30:29,759 --> 01:30:31,260
一个地方
from the outside.

1156
01:30:31,344 --> 01:30:33,554
她在主脑
She's in Cerebro.

1157
01:30:33,763 --> 01:30:35,431
她在你的家 教授
She's in your house, Professor.

1158
01:30:36,057 --> 01:30:37,224
他们在用她做实验
They're experimenting on her.

1159
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,436
试图汲取她的能力 来夺取我们的能力
Trying to tap into her power, so they can take ours.

1160
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:41,520
夺取所有变种人的能力
Take all of ours.

1161
01:30:41,604 --> 01:30:43,397
如果你知道她活着 为什么不去救她
If you knew this, why didn't you go after her?

1162
01:30:43,481 --> 01:30:46,192
我们试过 但戒备森严
We tried. It's too heavily guarded.

1163
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:47,401
我知道一些他们不知道的
I may know a few things

1164
01:30:47,485 --> 01:30:49,945
我的家的事
about that house they don't.

1165
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:58,537
凯蒂 我要去帮忙了
Kitty, I'm going to get help.

1166
01:30:58,704 --> 01:31:00,873
我要带一个人回来帮你
I'm gonna bring back somebody to help you.

1167
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:06,587
把你自己带回来就好
Please, just bring yourself back.

1168
01:31:30,736 --> 01:31:32,196
瑞雯 好了
Raven, stop.

1169
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:34,782
别再逃避了
Stop running.

1170
01:31:35,116 --> 01:31:36,283
查尔斯
Charles?

1171
01:31:38,327 --> 01:31:39,411
你在哪里
Where are you?

1172
01:31:39,495 --> 01:31:40,704
我在家里
Back at the house...

1173
01:31:40,788 --> 01:31:42,581
你该待的地方
where you should be.

1174
01:31:42,748 --> 01:31:44,917
你该回家了
I need you to come home.

1175
01:31:45,626 --> 01:31:47,461
我知道自己该干什么
I know what I need to do.

1176
01:31:51,132 --> 01:31:52,341
如果你杀了崔斯克
If you kill Trask...

1177
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,593
会出现更多跟他一样的人
you will be creating countless more just like him.

1178
01:31:55,261 --> 01:31:56,345
那就把他们都杀了
Then I'll kill them, too.

1179
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:58,973
这是埃瑞克的思想 不是你的
Those are Erik's words, not yours.

1180
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,517
哦
Oh!

1181
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:05,146
和我一起长大的那个女孩不会杀人
The girl I grew up with wasn't capable of killing.

1182
01:32:05,271 --> 01:32:06,272
她善良
She was good...

1183
01:32:06,397 --> 01:32:08,983
公正 富有同情心
fair, full of compassion.

1184
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:12,069
我有同情心
I have compassion.

1185
01:32:12,153 --> 01:32:13,654
但不是给崔斯克
Just not for Trask.

1186
01:32:13,779 --> 01:32:15,447
他杀了我们太多同胞
He's murdered too many of us.

1187
01:32:20,161 --> 01:32:21,287
直接放倒她 查尔斯 进入她的大脑
Shut her down, Charles. Get in her head.

1188
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:22,913
她不让我进去
She's not letting me in.

1189
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:26,292
我只能保持联系 我还不够强大
I'm barely holding on. I'm not strong enough yet.

1190
01:32:34,425 --> 01:32:36,302
我知道崔斯克的恶行
I know what Trask has done...

1191
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,971
可杀了他 死去的人也回不来
but killing him will not bring them back.

1192
01:32:39,638 --> 01:32:40,723
杀了他 只会把你送上
It will set you on a path...

1193
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:42,808
一条不归路
from which there is no return.

1194
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:45,227
永无止境的杀戮
An endless cycle of killing.

1195
01:32:45,394 --> 01:32:49,148
彼此残杀 直到灰飞烟灭
Us and them, until there is nothing left.

1196
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:53,986
你和我 我们能阻止这一切
But we can stop it, right now, you and I.

1197
01:32:54,904 --> 01:32:57,907
你必须要回家
You just have to come home.

1198
01:32:59,283 --> 01:33:01,076
必须要
I have to?

1199
01:33:01,452 --> 01:33:02,912
你还是老样子 查尔斯
You haven't changed at all, Charles.

1200
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:05,331
我说了
Like I said...

1201
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:07,833
我知道自己该干什么
I know exactly what I have to do.

1202
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:11,503
你知道
You do?

1203
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:16,425
那么 无论你去哪里 我都会找到你
Then, wherever you go, I will find you.

1204
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:20,679
瑞雯 如果你逼迫我 我会阻止你
And, Raven, if you make me, I will stop you.

1205
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:23,515
好运 查尔斯
Good luck, Charles.

1206
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:37,988
她在哪里
Where is she?

1207
01:33:38,155 --> 01:33:40,241
她在机场 准备登机
She's in an airport, boarding a plane.

1208
01:33:40,324 --> 01:33:41,659
她可以去任何地方
She could be going anywhere.

1209
01:33:45,329 --> 01:33:47,122
休息吧 查尔斯
Get some rest, Charles.

1210
01:33:47,206 --> 01:33:48,457
我们会在早上追踪她查出
We'll track her in the morning and find out

1211
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,751
她要去哪里
exactly where she's going.

1212
01:33:54,004 --> 01:33:56,173
火箭确实在基地外坠毁
...rockets did land outside the base,

1213
01:33:56,257 --> 01:33:59,009
5死12伤
killing five civilians and wounding 12 others.

1214
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:01,971
在
Yeah?

1215
01:34:05,766 --> 01:34:08,143
你知道那玩意含有致癌物吧
You know that those things can give you cancer?

1216
01:34:08,227 --> 01:34:11,480
我在实验室做过毒品测试
I've done some toxicology tests in the lab, and...

1217
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:17,903
你是想知道什么吧
You want something?

1218
01:34:19,071 --> 01:34:20,698
对 我来
Yeah, I'm...

1219
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:23,534
我知道这很复杂
I know it's complicated,

1220
01:34:23,617 --> 01:34:25,160
可能有各种你能说
and there's probably all kinds of rules

1221
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:27,162
不能说的规则和原因
and reasons for what you can and can't say,

1222
01:34:28,539 --> 01:34:30,457
但我想你你能不能告诉我
but I was wondering if you could tell me

1223
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:34,753
在未来 我活着吗
in the future, do I make it?

1224
01:34:35,421 --> 01:34:36,505
没有
No.

1225
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:38,966
哦
Oh.

1226
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:40,801
好吧
Okay.

1227
01:34:42,803 --> 01:34:44,430
没关系 一样感谢
It's okay. Thanks.

1228
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:45,514
嘿 小子
Hey, kid?

1229
01:34:48,559 --> 01:34:50,477
我就是来自那个世界
It's just the world I came from.

1230
01:35:00,446 --> 01:35:02,281
我们要回到过去
We're going backwards in time.

1231
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,793
明天 我们的总统
Tomorrow, in front of the White House,

1232
01:35:14,877 --> 01:35:16,545
将在白宫发表声明
the President will make his announcement.

1233
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:18,756
出席的还有国防部长莱尔德
He will be joined by Secretary of Defense Laird...

1234
01:35:18,881 --> 01:35:20,257
以及处理变种人问题上
and has even sought the help

1235
01:35:20,341 --> 01:35:22,509
提供特别指导帮助的
of renowned scientist Bolivar Trask...

1236
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:25,220
著名科学家玻利瓦尔·崔斯克
his special advisor to combat this mutant issue.

1237
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:27,890
白宫已经要求三大电视网
The White House has asked all three networks

1238
01:35:27,973 --> 01:35:29,350
直播这一活动
to air the event live,

1239
01:35:29,433 --> 01:35:31,727
这不仅对美国
as it is a matter of importance

1240
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:33,187
至关重要
not only to the United States,

1241
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,731
对全球每个公民也是
but to every citizen from around the globe.

1242
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:37,608
这个活动尚无其它动向
There are no other details about the event...

1243
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:47,951
瑞雯
Raven...

1244
01:35:48,702 --> 01:35:50,579
我的天
My God.

1245
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:53,207
我不明白 你在这里做什么
I don't understand. What are you doing here?

1246
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,335
我
I, uh...

1247
01:35:57,211 --> 01:35:58,921
我猜 我只是意识到
I guess, I just realized

1248
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:01,090
我无处可去了
I have nowhere else to go.

1249
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,968
我去叫醒查尔斯
不 不要
I've gotta wake Charles...
No, don't.

1250
01:36:05,677 --> 01:36:07,012
先等等
Just wait.

1251
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:24,655
你真不该走上这条路的
You really shouldn't walk on this.

1252
01:36:24,738 --> 01:36:27,282
我经历过更糟的
I've had worse.

1253
01:36:27,366 --> 01:36:30,411
你这几年一直住在这里
So, you've been living here all these years?

1254
01:36:30,494 --> 01:36:32,162
总得有人照顾查尔斯
Someone had to take care of Charles.

1255
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:36,625
你知道的 他想念你
You know, he's missed you.

1256
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:39,878
他想念曾经的我
He misses who I was.

1257
01:36:40,879 --> 01:36:45,217
我不是他希望的样子了
I'm not who he wants me to be anymore.

1258
01:36:47,761 --> 01:36:49,471
我想念你
I've missed you.

1259
01:36:51,348 --> 01:36:53,767
你现在一直这副模样了
So, you're like this all the time now.

1260
01:36:53,851 --> 01:36:54,852
什么模样
Like what?

1261
01:36:55,352 --> 01:36:56,353
这样
This.

1262
01:36:58,689 --> 01:37:00,441
不是一直这副模样
No, not all the time.

1263
01:37:00,524 --> 01:37:02,609
我早上注射一次
I take a shot in the morning,

1264
01:37:02,693 --> 01:37:04,278
激动时再注射一次
and I need another if I get worked up.

1265
01:37:05,195 --> 01:37:07,030
激动
Worked up?

1266
01:37:07,114 --> 01:37:08,782
对 对 感觉情绪强烈
Yeah, yeah,when I'm...

1267
01:37:08,949 --> 01:37:12,453
或兴奋的时候
...emotional or excited.

1268
01:37:14,455 --> 01:37:17,708
任何动物都会
Any animal urges.

1269
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:19,251
嗯
Hmm.

1270
01:37:20,586 --> 01:37:22,337
通常 我能摆脱它们
Usually, I can fight them off.

1271
01:37:22,504 --> 01:37:24,173
也许 我们不该摆脱
Well, maybe, we shouldn't have to fight off

1272
01:37:24,256 --> 01:37:26,049
我们的天性
the things that come naturally to us.

1273
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:02,920
你记得最后你对我说了什么吗
Do you remember one of the last things you said to me?

1274
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:07,841
我这副模样 永远不会被认为是美丽
That I would never be deemed beautiful, looking like this?

1275
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:13,305
你还这么想吗
Do you still think that?

1276
01:38:13,472 --> 01:38:16,308
也许吧 你看到巴黎发生了什么
Maybe. You saw what happened in Paris.

1277
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:19,728
你知道他们怎么看待我们
You know what they think of us.

1278
01:38:21,021 --> 01:38:22,397
你怎么想
What do you think?

1279
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,407
我认为你很美丽
I think you're beautiful.

1280
01:38:33,075 --> 01:38:34,826
你自己呢
What about yourself?

1281
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:45,212
你该休息了
You should get some rest.

1282
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:49,633
你回家我很高兴
I'm glad you're home.

1283
01:38:55,722 --> 01:38:57,182
汉克
Hank?

1284
01:38:58,350 --> 01:39:01,478
你记得最后我对你说了什么吗
Do you remember the last thing I said to you?

1285
01:39:05,482 --> 01:39:08,610
是 变种人和自豪
It was, "Mutant and proud."

1286
01:39:35,846 --> 01:39:40,058
旧天然气管道和水管直朝房子
The old gas and water pipes lead straight to the house.

1287
01:39:45,981 --> 01:39:48,442
墙是强化钢筑成的
The walls are made of reinforced steel.

1288
01:39:48,525 --> 01:39:50,444
也就是 一扇门
In other words, a door.

1289
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:05,417
你们现在直接走过大厅
You're walking directly over the hall now.

1290
01:40:58,095 --> 01:41:00,180
曾经我也趟在那块平板上
I've been on that slab.

1291
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:02,182
我告诉你们那是什么感受
Let me show you how it feels.

1292
01:41:08,772 --> 01:41:10,941
小淘气 小淘气 快 醒醒
Rogue, Rogue, come on. Wake up.

1293
01:41:14,486 --> 01:41:15,737
小淘气
Rogue.

1294
01:41:16,822 --> 01:41:19,282
快 小淘气 醒醒 醒醒 是我
Come on, Rogue, wake up. Wake up, it's me.

1295
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:28,792
不
No.

1296
01:41:51,857 --> 01:41:54,860
小淘气 小淘气 小淘气 没事的 我们一起来的
Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, it's okay. He's with me.

1297
01:41:54,985 --> 01:41:56,111
来救你出去
We're gonna get you out of here.

1298
01:42:17,007 --> 01:42:18,175
埃瑞克 鲍比
Erik, Bobby.

1299
01:42:18,383 --> 01:42:19,885
逃出去 快逃
Get out of there! Now!

1300
01:42:38,153 --> 01:42:39,154
带她走
Take her!

1301
01:42:39,738 --> 01:42:41,490
鲍比 不要
Bobby! No!

1302
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:45,368
鲍比
Bobby!

1303
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:00,759
鲍比
Bobby!

1304
01:43:35,252 --> 01:43:36,336
教授
Professor!

1305
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:39,965
快离开这里
Get us out of here.

1306
01:43:40,048 --> 01:43:41,883
鲍比
我知道
Bobby.
I know.

1307
01:45:20,231 --> 01:45:21,983
我很抱歉 查尔斯
I'm sorry, Charles.

1308
01:45:50,595 --> 01:45:52,263
鲍比呢
Where's Bobby?

1309
01:45:54,224 --> 01:45:55,934
我很遗憾 凯蒂
I'm sorry, Kitty.

1310
01:46:32,971 --> 01:46:34,097
你好 罗根
Hello, Logan.

1311
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:44,899
小淘气
Rogue.

1312
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:49,320
瑞雯来过了
Raven was here.

1313
01:46:49,487 --> 01:46:51,031
我搞砸了
糟了
I screwed up.
Shit.

1314
01:47:03,043 --> 01:47:04,502
我们现在没法追踪她了
We can't track her now.

1315
01:47:06,796 --> 01:47:08,423
她切断了纽带
She's cut her ties.

1316
01:47:11,301 --> 01:47:13,136
我昨晚听新闻报道
Hey, I saw in the news last night

1317
01:47:13,219 --> 01:47:15,597
下午在华盛顿有一个
there's going to be an announcement in Washington this afternoon

1318
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,932
关于变种人的新草案的通告
about a new protocol for mutants.

1319
01:47:20,101 --> 01:47:22,103
我发明了这套系统
I set the system I designed...

1320
01:47:22,187 --> 01:47:24,564
录制三大电视网报道巴黎的新闻
to record any news about Paris over all three networks...

1321
01:47:24,939 --> 01:47:26,024
还有公视网
and PBS.

1322
01:47:26,441 --> 01:47:28,026
三大电视网 喔
All three? Wow.

1323
01:47:28,318 --> 01:47:30,028
对 还有公视网
Yeah, and PBS.

1324
01:47:31,029 --> 01:47:32,405
看我找到了什么
Look what I found.

1325
01:47:32,572 --> 01:47:34,157
明天 我们的总统
Tomorrow, in front of the White House,

1326
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:35,450
将在白宫发表声明
the President will make his announcement.

1327
01:47:35,992 --> 01:47:38,161
出席的还有国防部长莱尔德
He will be joined by Secretary of Defense Laird...

1328
01:47:38,328 --> 01:47:39,829
以及处理变种人问题上
and has even sought the help

1329
01:47:39,913 --> 01:47:41,915
提供特别指导帮助的
of renowned scientist Bolivar Trask...

1330
01:47:42,082 --> 01:47:45,585
著名科学家玻利瓦尔·崔斯克
his special advisor to combat this mutant issue.

1331
01:47:45,752 --> 01:47:46,836
白宫已经要求
The White House has asked--

1332
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,088
瑞雯不明白
Raven doesn't realize...

1333
01:47:48,171 --> 01:47:50,048
如果她在这样一个受全世界瞩目的活动上
that if she kills Trask at an event like that...

1334
01:47:50,131 --> 01:47:52,550
杀了崔斯克
with the whole world watching...

1335
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:55,762
那样的话 我就白来了
Then I came a long way for nothing.

1336
01:47:56,304 --> 01:47:58,264
还有更糟的 有报道说
And there's more bad news. I saw in a report...

1337
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:00,350
他们在巴黎拿到了她的血液样本
they found traces of her blood in Paris.

1338
01:48:00,725 --> 01:48:03,686
说不定 他们已经得到了她的DNA
For all we know, they already have her DNA...

1339
01:48:03,853 --> 01:48:04,979
万事俱备
which is all they'd need.

1340
01:48:05,063 --> 01:48:07,232
就差制造未来哨兵了
To create the Sentinels of the future.

1341
01:48:10,777 --> 01:48:12,821
量子论里有一种理论
There's a theory in quantum physics...

1342
01:48:12,904 --> 01:48:14,489
时间是永恒的
that time is immutable.

1343
01:48:14,739 --> 01:48:16,574
就像河流 扔快石头
It's like a river. You can throw a pebble into it...

1344
01:48:16,658 --> 01:48:19,953
会有波浪 但最终会恢复平静
and create a ripple, but the current always corrects itself.

1345
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:24,624
无论你做什么 河还是朝同样的方向流去
No matter what you do, the river just keeps flowing in the same direction.

1346
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:26,334
你想说什么
What are you trying to say?

1347
01:48:26,501 --> 01:48:28,419
我想说
What I'm saying is...

1348
01:48:28,586 --> 01:48:30,130
如果战争不可避免
what if the war is inevitable?

1349
01:48:30,255 --> 01:48:32,632
如果她注定要杀死崔斯克
What if she's meant to kill Trask?

1350
01:48:34,175 --> 01:48:36,719
或许她就是这样的人
What if this is just simply who she is?

1351
01:48:38,763 --> 01:48:40,598
人偶尔一次失足
Just because someone stumbles,

1352
01:48:40,682 --> 01:48:42,725
迷失了方向
loses their way...

1353
01:48:42,892 --> 01:48:44,894
不等于永远会迷失下去
doesn't mean they're lost forever.

1354
01:48:49,732 --> 01:48:52,443
我不相信那套理论 汉克
No, I don't believe that theory, Hank.

1355
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:56,322
我不相信她是那样的人
And I cannot believe that is who she is.

1356
01:48:57,615 --> 01:48:58,700
准备飞机
Ready the plane.

1357
01:48:58,783 --> 01:49:01,119
我们去华盛顿
We're going to Washington.

1358
01:49:18,303 --> 01:49:19,804
你没事吧
You all right?

1359
01:49:20,054 --> 01:49:20,847
好多了
Getting there.

1360
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:28,438
无论发生什么 你都要答应我一件事
Whatever happens today, I need you to promise me something.

1361
01:49:29,314 --> 01:49:32,442
你在我的大脑里看见了许多悲伤回忆
You've looked into my mind and seen a lot of bad...

1362
01:49:33,318 --> 01:49:34,986
可也有美好回忆
but you've seen the good, too.

1363
01:49:36,029 --> 01:49:37,697
X战警
The X-Men.

1364
01:49:38,948 --> 01:49:40,533
答应我 你会找到我们
Promise me you'll find us.

1365
01:49:42,327 --> 01:49:44,329
用你的力量 把我们聚在一起
Use your power, bring us together.

1366
01:49:44,954 --> 01:49:47,040
指引我们 引领我们
Guide us. Lead us.

1367
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:51,502
暴风女 斯科特
Storm. Scott.

1368
01:49:53,671 --> 01:49:55,006
琴
Jean.

1369
01:49:56,341 --> 01:49:58,509
记住这些名字
Remember those names.

1370
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:01,846
我们有很多人
There are so many of us.

1371
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:04,849
我们需要你 教授
We will need you, Professor.

1372
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:10,230
我会尽力的
I'll do my best.

1373
01:50:10,396 --> 01:50:12,065
这就足够了
Your best is enough.

1374
01:50:13,983 --> 01:50:15,693
相信我
Trust me.

1375
01:50:39,676 --> 01:50:42,136
发现12架运输机 10英里外
There's 12 carriers inbound, 10 miles!

1376
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:44,222
它们找来了
They've found us.

1377
01:51:01,281 --> 01:51:03,449
今天将有数千人聚集于此
of people will be gathered here today.

1378
01:51:03,533 --> 01:51:04,909
他们从世界各地赶来
They've come from all over the world...

1379
01:51:05,034 --> 01:51:07,829
与至少50个国家的新闻工作者
to witness history, along with news crews...

1380
01:51:07,996 --> 01:51:09,539
一起见证历史
from at least 50 different countries.

1381
01:51:11,249 --> 01:51:12,583
谢谢
Thank you.

1382
01:51:14,961 --> 01:51:16,129
能看一下邀请函吗
Can I see your invitations, please?

1383
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:18,381
当然可以
Yes, you may.

1384
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:19,632
这两个人跟我一起的
These two are with me.

1385
01:51:19,716 --> 01:51:20,717
进去吧
Go ahead.

1386
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:21,926
谢谢
Thank you.

1387
01:51:28,725 --> 01:51:30,101
罗根
Logan!

1388
01:51:30,184 --> 01:51:31,436
请这边走 先生
Please, this way, sir.

1389
01:51:50,705 --> 01:51:54,584
第4步兵师 遭遇了德国s型地雷
Fourth infantry... Took a Bouncing Betty.

1390
01:51:55,835 --> 01:51:57,253
你遭遇了什么
What happened to you?

1391
01:51:58,338 --> 01:51:59,547
己方误伤
Friendly fire.

1392
01:52:00,590 --> 01:52:01,591
最糟的那种
The worst kind.

1393
01:52:01,799 --> 01:52:03,092
对
Yeah.

1394
01:52:17,148 --> 01:52:18,983
我还没找到她 但她一定在这里
I haven't found her yet, but she has to be here.

1395
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:20,693
有请总统先生
The President of the United States.

1396
01:52:43,591 --> 01:52:45,301
各位同胞们
My fellow Americans...

1397
01:52:45,468 --> 01:52:50,139
今天 我们面临着有史以来最严峻的威胁
today we face the gravest threat in our history...

1398
01:52:50,264 --> 01:52:51,432
变种人
mutants.

1399
01:52:54,602 --> 01:52:57,021
我们已经做好了准备
We have prepared for this threat.

1400
01:53:00,024 --> 01:53:03,611
借用罗伯特·奥本海默的名言
In the immortal words of Robert Oppenheimer...

1401
01:53:03,778 --> 01:53:04,904
看啊
"Behold.

1402
01:53:05,488 --> 01:53:08,282
世界将从此彻底改变
"The world will never be the same again."

1403
01:53:38,813 --> 01:53:39,814
要帮忙吗
Can I help you?

1404
01:53:43,192 --> 01:53:44,402
不需要
No, you can't.

1405
01:54:27,778 --> 01:54:28,988
它们来了
Here they come.

1406
01:54:35,703 --> 01:54:37,371
为了变种人兄弟姐妹
This is for you, brothers and sisters.

1407
01:54:39,957 --> 01:54:41,042
瑞雯
Raven?

1408
01:54:43,794 --> 01:54:44,879
找到她了
I have her.

1409
01:54:45,546 --> 01:54:46,756
让我去 查尔斯
Let me go, Charles.

1410
01:54:48,925 --> 01:54:50,384
在那里 看见了吗
There. You see?

1411
01:54:50,551 --> 01:54:51,636
那个特勤人员
Secret Serviceman.

1412
01:54:51,802 --> 01:54:52,887
在舞台左边
Left of the stage.

1413
01:54:53,012 --> 01:54:54,138
看到了
快去
Got him.
Go.

1414
01:55:14,909 --> 01:55:16,202
你在闹什么
What the hell are you doing?

1415
01:55:16,285 --> 01:55:17,703
我没让你启动它们
I didn't tell you to activate them.

1416
01:55:17,787 --> 01:55:18,955
我没有
I didn't.

1417
01:55:37,556 --> 01:55:39,433
瑞雯 求你听我说
Raven, please, listen to me.

1418
01:55:39,934 --> 01:55:44,063
上天给了我们第二次机会 让世界重新认识我们
We've been given a second chance to define who we are.

1419
01:55:46,107 --> 01:55:47,483
别这么做
Don't do this.

1420
01:55:50,903 --> 01:55:53,155
先生们 你们不能过去
Gentlemen, you cannot pass this point.

1421
01:56:00,997 --> 01:56:02,748
我们阻止不了那么多
We can't stop that many.

1422
01:56:02,915 --> 01:56:05,793
对 但我们能拖住它们
No, but we can slow them down.

1423
01:56:43,664 --> 01:56:45,333
埃瑞克
Erik!

1424
01:57:19,617 --> 01:57:20,618
啊
Ah!

1425
01:57:30,169 --> 01:57:31,879
暴风女
Storm!

1426
01:57:50,272 --> 01:57:51,690
快点 跟上 我们走
Go, go, go!

1427
01:57:53,651 --> 01:57:54,735
小心碰头
Watch your head!

1428
01:58:07,706 --> 01:58:08,791
快 快 快
Go, go, go!

1429
01:58:08,874 --> 01:58:10,251
进入三级戒备状态
Take us to DEFCON 3.

1430
01:58:10,418 --> 01:58:11,585
总统先生 我们已开启红色预警
Mr. President, we are Code Red.

1431
01:58:11,710 --> 01:58:13,087
防空戒备呢
What's our air defense readiness?

1432
01:58:13,254 --> 01:58:14,505
防空戒备已经准备就绪
All our air defenses are ready one.

1433
01:58:14,588 --> 01:58:16,006
刚才到底是什么情况
What the hell happened out there?

1434
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:17,174
我能解决
I will fix it.

1435
01:58:17,258 --> 01:58:18,300
这话你已经说过了
You said that before.

1436
01:58:18,426 --> 01:58:19,635
我本来要发表声明的
I wanted to make a statement.

1437
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:22,555
现在全世界都知道 我们无力保护他们了
Now the whole goddamn world knows we can't protect them.

1438
01:58:22,638 --> 01:58:23,722
我能解决
I will fix it.

1439
01:58:23,806 --> 01:58:25,599
最好这样
You damn well better.

1440
01:59:37,046 --> 01:59:38,047
查尔斯
Charles!

1441
01:59:39,173 --> 01:59:40,508
不 不 不
No, no, no...

1442
02:00:27,096 --> 02:00:28,847
大家都没事吧
Is everybody okay?

1443
02:01:02,715 --> 02:01:04,300
不
No!

1444
02:01:07,428 --> 02:01:08,470
小心上方
Behind you.

1445
02:01:10,848 --> 02:01:12,725
啊
Ah!

1446
02:01:51,263 --> 02:01:52,264
快
Now!

1447
02:02:30,302 --> 02:02:31,929
履行你们的使命吧
Do what you were made for.

1448
02:02:41,105 --> 02:02:42,606
你们在哪里
Where are you?

1449
02:02:48,404 --> 02:02:49,405
啊
Ah!

1450
02:02:59,957 --> 02:03:01,458
这交给我 快走
I got this! Go!

1451
02:03:44,251 --> 02:03:45,878
上帝啊
Oh, dear God, no.

1452
02:04:01,810 --> 02:04:04,021
今天是你的终结之日
So much for being a survivor.

1453
02:04:46,438 --> 02:04:47,731
变种人混进来了
One of them is in here.

1454
02:04:50,359 --> 02:04:52,110
不 不 不 别杀她
No, no, no! Don't kill it!

1455
02:04:52,778 --> 02:04:53,862
我要抓活的
I need it alive.

1456
02:05:07,292 --> 02:05:08,919
怎么回事
What the hell has happened?

1457
02:06:16,695 --> 02:06:18,905
你们造了这些武器来消灭我们
You built these weapons to destroy us.

1458
02:06:19,865 --> 02:06:21,575
为什么
Why?

1459
02:06:25,162 --> 02:06:27,873
因为你们畏惧我们的天赋
Because you are afraid of our gifts.

1460
02:06:28,832 --> 02:06:31,335
因为我们与众不同
Because we are different.

1461
02:06:32,502 --> 02:06:35,839
人类总是恐惧与他们不同的东西
Humanity has always feared that which is different.

1462
02:06:36,506 --> 02:06:37,883
我现在告诉你们
Well, I am here to tell you...

1463
02:06:38,091 --> 02:06:39,509
告诉这个世界
to tell the world...

1464
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:42,679
你们应该畏惧我们
you are right to fear us.

1465
02:06:43,055 --> 02:06:44,765
我们才是未来
We are the future.

1466
02:06:45,515 --> 02:06:48,185
我们才是继承这个星球的人
We are the ones who will inherit this earth.

1467
02:06:48,435 --> 02:06:51,021
凡是妨碍我们的那些人
And anyone who stands in our way...

1468
02:06:51,188 --> 02:06:53,190
都将会面对
will suffer the same fate as these men...

1469
02:06:53,357 --> 02:06:54,691
和他们同样的命运
you see before you.

1470
02:07:01,907 --> 02:07:04,534
你们原本想要展示你们的力量
Today was meant to be a display of your power.

1471
02:07:05,285 --> 02:07:07,371
可我给你们一个小小的提醒
Instead I give you a glimpse...

1472
02:07:07,537 --> 02:07:11,041
我的种族能对你们造成毁灭性的打击
of the devastation my race can unleash upon yours.

1473
02:07:20,258 --> 02:07:22,427
就把这当作对世界的警告吧
Let this be a warning to the world.

1474
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:25,931
而对我的变种人兄弟姐妹
And to my mutant brothers and sisters out there...

1475
02:07:26,723 --> 02:07:28,141
我要说
I say this.

1476
02:07:28,892 --> 02:07:30,560
不必躲藏
No more hiding.

1477
02:07:30,727 --> 02:07:32,562
不必再受苦
No more suffering.

1478
02:07:33,397 --> 02:07:35,774
你们已在羞耻和恐惧的
You have lived in the shadows...

1479
02:07:35,941 --> 02:07:38,777
阴影里生活得太久了 出来吧
in shame and fear for too long. Come out.

1480
02:07:40,028 --> 02:07:41,363
和我一起
Join me.

1481
02:07:41,446 --> 02:07:44,950
团结一心 携手作战
Fight together in a brotherhood of our kind.

1482
02:07:45,575 --> 02:07:47,244
崭新的明天
A new tomorrow...

1483
02:07:48,453 --> 02:07:50,247
将从今天开始
that starts today.

1484
02:07:57,546 --> 02:07:59,381
我们浪费了这么多年
All those years wasted...

1485
02:07:59,548 --> 02:08:01,550
你争我斗 查尔斯
fighting each other, Charles.

1486
02:08:05,095 --> 02:08:08,723
为了找回那些珍贵的岁月
To have a precious few of them back...

1487
02:08:23,238 --> 02:08:24,448
总统先生
让开
Mr. President, sir.
Stand down.

1488
02:08:24,531 --> 02:08:26,408
别拦着我
I said, stand down!

1489
02:08:28,243 --> 02:08:29,911
你想发表声明
You want to make a statement?

1490
02:08:30,370 --> 02:08:32,122
想杀我 没关系
Kill me. Fine.

1491
02:08:32,289 --> 02:08:34,249
放过其他人
But spare everyone else.

1492
02:08:46,803 --> 02:08:48,805
想当英雄 总统先生
Very heroic, Mr. President...

1493
02:08:49,306 --> 02:08:50,807
可你怎么没想过
but you had no intention...

1494
02:08:50,932 --> 02:08:53,143
放过我们
of sparing any of us.

1495
02:08:53,602 --> 02:08:56,938
我们种族的未来将从现在开始
The future of our species begins now.

1496
02:09:32,474 --> 02:09:33,642
你以前可是神枪手
You used to be a better shot.

1497
02:09:33,725 --> 02:09:34,976
相信我 现在也是
Trust me, I still am.

1498
02:09:48,823 --> 02:09:50,325
从我脑子里出去 查尔斯
Get out of my head, Charles!

1499
02:09:50,492 --> 02:09:51,993
瑞雯
Raven.

1500
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:54,037
请不要把我们变成敌人
Please, do not make us the enemy today.

1501
02:09:54,246 --> 02:09:56,081
看看周围 我们已经是了
Look around you. We already are.

1502
02:09:56,581 --> 02:09:58,333
不全是这样
Not all of us.

1503
02:09:58,542 --> 02:10:00,794
到目前为止
All you've done so far...

1504
02:10:01,127 --> 02:10:03,129
你是救了这些人的英雄
is save the lives of these men.

1505
02:10:04,172 --> 02:10:06,716
你可以让他们看到更好的结局
You can show them a better path.

1506
02:10:10,387 --> 02:10:11,846
放倒她 查尔斯
Shut her down, Charles.

1507
02:10:14,891 --> 02:10:17,561
从我们认识那天起 我就一直想控制你
I've been trying to control you ever since the day we met...

1508
02:10:18,144 --> 02:10:20,146
才让我们变成今天这样
and look where that's got us.

1509
02:10:22,274 --> 02:10:25,110
此时此刻 发生的一切
Everything that happens now...

1510
02:10:25,735 --> 02:10:27,946
都掌握在你手里
is in your hands.

1511
02:10:31,992 --> 02:10:34,744
我对你有信心 瑞雯 
I have faith in you, Raven.

1512
02:12:11,758 --> 02:12:13,885
他留给你了 查尔斯
He's all yours, Charles.

1513
02:12:41,454 --> 02:12:44,082
你把我交给他们 我还不如死了
If you let them have me, I'm as good as dead.

1514
02:12:44,249 --> 02:12:45,625
你知道吗
You know that.

1515
02:12:46,292 --> 02:12:47,877
我知道
I know.

1516
02:12:49,879 --> 02:12:51,548
再见 老朋友
Goodbye, old friend.

1517
02:12:54,217 --> 02:12:56,052
再见 埃瑞克
Goodbye, Erik.

1518
02:13:29,461 --> 02:13:31,463
你确定要放他们走吗
Are you sure you should let them go?

1519
02:13:32,422 --> 02:13:33,798
是的
Yes.

1520
02:13:34,424 --> 02:13:36,134
我对他们抱有希望
I have hope for them.

1521
02:13:37,302 --> 02:13:41,306
总有一天 汉克 我们会走到一起
There's going to be a time, Hank, when we are all together.

1522
02:13:45,185 --> 02:13:47,145
那罗根呢
What about Logan?

1523
02:14:18,968 --> 02:14:21,638
The first time

1524
02:14:24,641 --> 02:14:29,896
Ever I saw your face

1525
02:14:34,859 --> 02:14:38,196
I thought the sun...

1526
02:15:02,762 --> 02:15:06,015
巴克敏斯特·富勒在建筑界的优秀案例
Buckminster Fuller is a great example of an architect...

1527
02:15:06,099 --> 02:15:10,353
他的观念和乌托邦主义者极为相似
whose ideas were very similar to those of a utopian future.

1528
02:15:16,693 --> 02:15:19,362
早上好 罗根 起晚了吧
Good morning, Logan. Late start.

Are you okay?

1537
02:16:17,086 --> 02:16:18,504

You're here.

1538
02:16:19,130 --> 02:16:21,174
那我在哪里
Where else would I be?

1539
02:16:23,468 --> 02:16:24,469
喔
Whoa.

1540
02:16:25,303 --> 02:16:27,263

1541
02:16:28,806 --> 02:16:31,351
有些事永远不变
Well, some things never change.

1542
02:16:32,769 --> 02:16:34,354
见到你真好 斯科特
It's good to see you, Scott.

1543
02:16:36,147 --> 02:16:37,398

Uh-huh.

1544
02:16:37,482 --> 02:16:38,650
待会见 琴
See you later, Jean.

1545
02:16:42,779 --> 02:16:44,322
教授
Professor.

1546
02:16:44,781 --> 02:16:47,575
罗根 没出什么事吧
Logan, is everything all right?

1547
02:16:50,953 --> 02:16:52,413
没事
Yeah.

1548
02:16:53,456 --> 02:16:55,291

1550
02:17:13,142 --> 02:17:14,394
做到什么
Did what?

1551
02:17:14,477 --> 02:17:16,479
罗根 你不是要去上课吗
Logan, don't you have a class to teach?

1552
02:17:17,146 --> 02:17:18,815
上课
A class to teach?

1553
02:17:19,857 --> 02:17:20,942
历史课
History.

1554
02:17:21,651 --> 02:17:23,152
历史课
History?

1555
02:17:23,986 --> 02:17:25,655
是啊 我是要补习一下
Actually, I could use some help with that.

补习什么
Help with what?

1557
02:17:27,824 --> 02:17:31,327
补习从1973年以后所发生的一切
Pretty much everything after 1973.

1558
02:17:35,873 --> 02:17:38,918
我知道的历史应该有些不同
I think the history I know is a little different.

1559
02:17:40,545 --> 02:17:42,255
欢迎回来

Well...

1563
02:17:52,181 --> 02:17:54,350
我那时答应过你的
I had a promise to keep.

1564
02:17:55,518 --> 02:17:58,771
我们有好多过去的事情要聊一聊
You and I have a lot of catching up to do.

是啊
Yeah.

1566
02:18:04,736 --> 02:18:06,863
你记得最后的事是什么
What's the last thing you remember?

1567
02:18:11,951 --> 02:18:13,703
在水里
Drowning.

1568
02:18:21,961 --> 02:18:23,212
过去
The past.

1569
02:18:24,714 --> 02:18:25,965
一个未知
A new...

1570
02:18:26,048 --> 02:18:27,800
多变的世界
and uncertain world.

1571
02:18:39,228 --> 02:18:41,522
一个拥有无限可能的世界
A world of endless possibilities.

1572
02:18:44,275 --> 02:18:46,402
以及无穷的结局
And infinite outcomes.

1573
02:18:48,070 --> 02:18:49,197
怎么了
You kidding me?

1574
02:18:49,322 --> 02:18:50,782
什么 他还活着
Oh, he's alive!

1575
02:18:55,161 --> 02:18:57,914
无数的选择造就了我们的命运
Countless choices define our fate.

1576
02:18:58,831 --> 02:19:01,292
每一个选择 每一个瞬间
Each choice, each moment...

1577
02:19:01,459 --> 02:19:04,086
在时间的长河里泛起一道涟漪
a ripple in the river of time.

1578
02:19:04,253 --> 02:19:06,589
怎么处置他 史崔克少校
What do you want us to do with him, Major Stryker?

1579
02:19:06,756 --> 02:19:08,508
涟漪足够多
Enough ripples...

1580
02:19:08,674 --> 02:19:11,260
就能改变水流
and you change the tide.

1581
02:19:11,427 --> 02:19:12,512
把他交给我吧
I'll take him from here.

1582
02:19:12,678 --> 02:19:16,599
因为未来永远不是定数
For the future is never truly set.
