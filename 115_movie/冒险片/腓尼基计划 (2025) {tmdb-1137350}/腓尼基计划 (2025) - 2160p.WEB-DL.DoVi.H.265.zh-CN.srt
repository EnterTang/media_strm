00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:34,249
A story spread among the Phoenicians

2
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,979
In 814 BC

3
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:41,269
the Tyrian king Mutto had a daughter named DidoBefore his death

4
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,051
King Mutto decided that his daughter Dido and

5
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:48,329
his son Pygmalion would ascend the throne together

6
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:49,469
However

7
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:53,149
Pygmalion did not want to share the throne with her sister

8
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:53,629
So

9
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,069
he murdered Dido s husband who was  the high priest that time

10
00:00:57,949 --> 00:00:59,489
All happened unexpectedly

11
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,909
Princess Dido did not have time to resist

12
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:05,369
and she and her followers had to hurriedly sail across the sea and landed in Carthage

13
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,769
in what is now modern Tunisia

14
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:13,639
She wanted some land to make herself and her followers settle down

15
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,953
Dido bartered with the locals and finally agreed to purchase 

16
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:21,369
a piece of land what she could contain within the skin of a bull

17
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,529
The question is

18
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:27,529
how big can a skin of bull cover

19
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:31,819
The savvy Princess Dido came up with an idea

20
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,769
She cut the hide into very thin strips

21
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:37,789
connecting the ends of the strips

22
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,409
In order to save the hide

23
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,309
the land she chose was sea-based

24
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:47,719
so that the sea formed the other side

25
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:54,069
In the end Princess Dido laid the hide out in a semi-circle

26
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:57,759
Is the area circling this way large

27
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,699
Mathematically

28
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,929
we classify it as a maximum problem

29
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:06,191
when the perimeter of a rectangular is constant

30
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:10,391
what are the length and the width making the largest area

31
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:15,201
This problem is similar to that of Princess Dido

32
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:26,611
In fact how to get a largest area when the perimeter of a rectangular is constant

33
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:29,671
In mathematics

34
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:32,491
such problems can be called constrained optimization problems

35
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:35,071
also called conditional extremum

36
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:39,001
To concise it to a mathematical problem

37
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:40,661
that is

38
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:49,101
When the perimeter of the rectangle is constant what are the length   and the width   maximizing the largest area of the rectangle

39
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:55,131
According to the extremum theory

40
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:59,889
we need to find the maximum value S=xy where max represents the maximum value

41
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:06,939
and the constraint condition is 2x+2y=L

42
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,209
The solution to the above problem is not complex

43
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:15,029
From the condition

44
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,799
we rewrite y as y=1/2L-x

45
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:26,091
and substitute the expression for y into the area formula

46
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:40,701
which can make S be organized into

47
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:50,761
If the term   equals to zero

48
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:54,381
the area S becomes largest

49
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,891
Then when x and y are equal to L/4

50
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:10,189
the area of the rectangle at this time takes the maximum value L^2/2

51
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:14,611
The above problem is about the rectangular area

52
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:18,721
now return to the problem of Princess Dido¡¯s land area

53
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:26,831
There is a key difference between the Princess Dido¡¯s land area and the rectangular area

54
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:29,411
that is in the Princess Dido¡¯s area problem

55
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:31,731
we have no idea of the land¡¯s shape

56
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:37,131
but we know that the shape of the rectangular area problem is rectangular

57
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:43,461
which is easy to know its area formula and its perimeter

58
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:51,501
 For the Princess Dido¡¯s land area which have no idea of the land¡¯s shape

59
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,661
mathematically

60
00:04:55,291 --> 00:05:00,721
we employ the general curve equations to describe the boundary curve

61
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:07,531
Let the parameter equations are x=x(t) ,y=y(t)

62
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:10,821
and t is greater than or equal to t1 and less than or equal to t2. In summary

63
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:30,411
 the Princess Dido¡¯s land area problem is to determining the boundary curve equations x(t) and y(t) and get the maximum area under the condition the perimeter is constant

64
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,441
On the other word

65
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:41,531
the Princess Dido¡¯s land area problem is to cover the maximum land area when the length of the bull skin strip is constant
