00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,230
这里是博克岛 狂风呼啸 没有阳光的气候
{\fscx75\fscy75}This is Berk, boasting the kind of balmy, fun-in-the-sun climate

3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,010
恶劣到可以冻坏你的脾脏
{\fscx75\fscy75}that will give you frostbite on your spleen.

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,100
我们一年一度的节日
{\fscx75\fscy75}The one upside is our annual holiday.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,520
我们称之为Snoggletog
{\fscx75\fscy75}We call it Snoggletog.

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,620
为什么我们会选择这样一个愚蠢的名字仍是一个谜
{\fscx75\fscy75}Why we chose such a stupid name remains a mystery.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,560
但随着漫长的战争的结束
{\fscx75\fscy75}But with the war long over...

8
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,330
以及龙和我们一起生活 今年的Snoggletog节
{\fscx75\fscy75}...and dragons living amongst us, this year's Snoggletog...

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,800
一定会成为一段难以磨灭的记忆
{\fscx75\fscy75}...promises to be one to remember.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,300
好了 好了 我来了
{\fscx75\fscy75}OK, OK! I'm coming!

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,430
早上好 "专横先生"
{\fscx75\fscy75}Good morning, Mr. Bossy.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,820
你一定要总是那么早就叫醒我去飞行吗
{\fscx75\fscy75}Do you always have to wake me up so early to go flying...?

13
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,920
破假肢
{\fscx75\fscy75}Stupid leg.

14
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,160
谢谢啦 伙计 我没事
{\fscx75\fscy75}Thanks, buddy. I'm OK.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,230
嗯 我们现在可以去飞行啦
{\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah, we can go flying now.

16
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,030
呦 呦 什么? 呦
{\fscx75\fscy75}Eww! Eww! What?! Eww!

17
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,200
无牙
{\fscx75\fscy75}Toothless!

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,100
来吧 让我们瞧瞧你今天能做到什么程度
{\fscx75\fscy75}Come on! Let's see what you got today!

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,110
耶 你准备好了吗
{\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah! OK, you ready?

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,060
放轻松
{\fscx75\fscy75}Easy...

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,970
太棒了 终于成功了
{\fscx75\fscy75}Yes! Finally!

22
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,640
对 对 不 不 那个应该挂高点
{\fscx75\fscy75}Yes, yes... No, no! That one a wee bit higher!

23
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,460
-这里? -那里 就是那里
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Here? - There! That's the spot!

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,830
呀
{\fscx75\fscy75}Roar!

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,740
干得好 Meatlug
{\fscx75\fscy75}Attaboy, Meatlug.

26
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,910
准备好了吗 姑娘
{\fscx75\fscy75}Are you ready, girl?

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,490
诸神啊
{\fscx75\fscy75}By Odin's beard, Gobber,

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,060
维京人居然和龙一起过节
{\fscx75\fscy75}Vikings spending the winter holiday with dragons!

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,970
-祖先们会怎么说呢 -他们肯定会认为我们疯了
{\fscx75\fscy75}- What would the fathers say? - They'd think we'd lost our minds.

30
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,240
干得好 干得好 你们都干得很好
{\fscx75\fscy75}Well done! Well done. All of you!

31
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,110
我从未想过我会活着看到今天 博克岛一派和平景象
{\fscx75\fscy75}I never thought I'd live to see this day: peace on the island of Berk.

32
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,560
这肯定是我们未曾见过的最盛大的节日
{\fscx75\fscy75}This will surely be the greatest holiday we've ever seen.

33
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,380
搞什么鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75}What the...?

34
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,760
雷神搞什么鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75}What in Thor's name?

35
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,130
回来 你们干什么去
{\fscx75\fscy75}Come back! What are you doing?

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,590
Meatlug
{\fscx75\fscy75}Meatlug!

37
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,410
-怎么了? -发生什么事了?
{\fscx75\fscy75}- What's going on? - What's happening?

38
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,790
希卡普在哪?
{\fscx75\fscy75}Where's Hiccup?

39
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,330
你觉得怎样 伙计? 想再来一次吗?
{\fscx75\fscy75}What do you say, bud? Wanna go again?

40
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,410
哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}Whoa!

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,580
哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}Whoa!

42
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,900
哇 哇 哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

43
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,360
哦 不 我的头盔
{\fscx75\fscy75}Oh, no, my helmet!

44
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,790
哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}Whoa!

45
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,600
无牙 不 不 不 不 不 不 不
{\fscx75\fscy75}Toothless! No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

46
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,500
哇 哇 等等 无牙 停下
{\fscx75\fscy75}Whoa, whoa, wait! Toothless! Stop!

47
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,040
我待会再把它拿回来 伙计
{\fscx75\fscy75}We'll get it later, buddy.

48
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,070
我们要回去弄明白究竟发生了什么
{\fscx75\fscy75}We need to get back and find out what's going on.

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,540
怎么了 你要去哪里?
{\fscx75\fscy75}What's the matter? Where are you going?

50
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,080
不 不 不 别走 Stormfly 别走 求你了
{\fscx75\fscy75}No, no, no, don't leave, Stormfly! Don't go! Please?

51
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,910
-Astrid -Hiccup 怎么回事?
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Astrid! - Hiccup! What's going on?

52
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,320
它们要去哪?
{\fscx75\fscy75}Where are they going?

53
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,340
-它们为什么要离开? -发生什么事了?
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Why did they leave? - What's happening?!

54
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,750
如果它们再也不回来了怎么办?
{\fscx75\fscy75}What if they never come back?!

55
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,130
-请停下来 -冷静
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Stop, please! - Calm down!

56
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,500
给他说话的机会
{\fscx75\fscy75}Give him a chance to speak!

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,570
Hiccup 我们所有人的龙要去哪?
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hiccup, where are all of our dragons going?

58
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,440
爸 我不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75}Dad, I don't know.

59
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,390
它们要去哪? Snoggletog节办不成了
{\fscx75\fscy75}Where'd they go? Snoggletog is ruined!

60
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,360
办得成 我们是维京人
{\fscx75\fscy75}It's not ruined! We're Vikings!

61
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,000
我们世世代代在没有龙的情况下都完美地完成了节日庆祝活动
{\fscx75\fscy75}We've been perfectly happy celebrating without dragons for generations.

62
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,630
没有道理我们不能再来一遍
{\fscx75\fscy75}And there's no reason we can't do it again.

63
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,100
现在 我们不知道它们去了哪
{\fscx75\fscy75}Now, we don't know where they've gone off to.

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,790
但我们要对它们能尽快回来充满信心
{\fscx75\fscy75}But we have to have faith that they'll be back again soon.

65
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,590
-我说得对吗? -你说得对 我们是维京人
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Am I right? - You're right! We are Vikings!

66
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,460
我们坚韧不拔…大多时候是啦
{\fscx75\fscy75}We're tough... most of the time.

67
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,380
让我们唱些Snoggletog歌
{\fscx75\fscy75}Let's sing some Snoggletog songs.

68
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,300
-真让人诅丧 -我知道
{\fscx75\fscy75}- That was depressing. - I know.

69
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,310
人家还期盼着跟Stormfly过节呢
{\fscx75\fscy75}I was looking forward to spending the holiday with Stormfly.

70
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,610
你怎么那么高兴啊? 你不想念Meatlug吗
{\fscx75\fscy75}What are you so happy about? Don't you miss Meatlug?

71
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,380
我?
{\fscx75\fscy75}Me?

72
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,620
哦 对喔
{\fscx75\fscy75}Oh, yeah.

73
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,220
我好想念它啊
{\fscx75\fscy75}I miss him so much!

74
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,270
嗯 晚安
{\fscx75\fscy75}Well, good night.

75
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,680
我想到了一个主意 让我们创造一些节日传统
{\fscx75\fscy75}I've got an idea. Let's come up with a bunch of new holiday traditions.

76
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,450
你们知道的 为了忘记悲伤
{\fscx75\fscy75}You know, to bury the sadness.

77
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,520
其实 Astrid说得有道理
{\fscx75\fscy75}Actually, Astrid might be onto something.

78
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,320
说得轻巧 你的龙没有你哪也去不了
{\fscx75\fscy75}Easy for you to say. Your dragon can't go anywhere without you.

79
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,060
肯定很棒吧
{\fscx75\fscy75}Must be nice.

80
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,670
牦牛奶 喝些牦牛奶
{\fscx75\fscy75}Yak nog! Get your yak nog!

81
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,180
来吧 来份泡泡多的 欢欣美味杯
{\fscx75\fscy75}Come on! Get a frothy, delicious cup of cheer!

82
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,550
嘿 大家伙 都来尝尝我为节日特制的新饮料
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, you guys, try this tasty new beverage I made for the holiday.

83
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,230
-这是什么味道? 是从你身上的发出来的吗 -是牦牛奶的味道
{\fscx75\fscy75}- What's the smell? Is that you? - It's yak nog!

84
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,390
如果我喝下它 我就会吐得哪里都是
{\fscx75\fscy75}If I drink that, I'm gonna yak nog all over the place.

85
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,530
或许你宁愿我在你脸上打上几拳?
{\fscx75\fscy75}Maybe you'd rather taste a punch in the face?

86
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,030
Astrid 听起来不错 我来一杯
{\fscx75\fscy75}Astrid, it sounds delightful. I'd love a mug.

87
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,770
你们真得尝尝这牦牛奶
{\fscx75\fscy75}You can really taste the yak.

88
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,570
-赞 这是什么? -你要尝尝吗?
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Yum! What is that? - You wanna try some?

89
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,370
这是我新制的传统饮料
{\fscx75\fscy75}It's my new traditional drink.

90
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,340
哦 你知道 嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75}Oh, you know, um,

91
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,780
我突然加说不清为什么地改变了我的想法
{\fscx75\fscy75}I have suddenly and inexplicably changed my mind.

92
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,150
那好吧 你都不知道你错过了什么
{\fscx75\fscy75}Well, you don't know what you're missing.

93
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,720
我确信Hiccup一定会喜欢这饮料
{\fscx75\fscy75}I bet Hiccup will love this.

94
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,150
你是在哭吗
{\fscx75\fscy75}Are you crying?

95
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,470
-Hiccup? -嗯 我在这 Astrid 就来
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Hiccup? - Yeah, I'm over here, Astrid. Coming.

96
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,040
给你 节日快乐 来自我的真挚祝福哟
{\fscx75\fscy75}Here. Happy holidays. From me to you.

97
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,380
-谢谢 夫人 -你在忙什么呢?
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Thank you, milady. - What are you up to?

98
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,410
好吧 你会认为我疯了
{\fscx75\fscy75}OK, you're gonna think I'm crazy,

99
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,180
但我就是不能停止考虑Tuffnut昨晚说的话
{\fscx75\fscy75}but I just couldn't stop thinking about what Tuffnut said last night.

100
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,690
无牙不能像其它的龙那样自由来去
{\fscx75\fscy75}Toothless can't come and go like the other dragons,

101
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,890
那是不公平的 我一夜未眠
{\fscx75\fscy75}and that's just not fair. I was up all night,

102
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,530
我想我找到了修复的办法
{\fscx75\fscy75}and I think I found a way to fix that.

103
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,500
不是吧 你为它做了新尾巴?
{\fscx75\fscy75}No way! You built him a new tail?

104
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,800
那它就可以在没有你的情况下自由飞翔
{\fscx75\fscy75}So he's gonna be able to fly without you!

105
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,070
嗯嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75}Mm-hmm.

106
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,720
哇 多棒的礼物啊
{\fscx75\fscy75}Wow! What a great gift.

107
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,570
万一它一去不返呢?
{\fscx75\fscy75}What if he never comes back?

108
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,910
-我在说啥呢? 它当然会回来 -嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75}- What am I saying? Of course he will. - Mm-hmm.

109
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,980
嗯 我要去传播更多的的节日欢乐 你真棒
{\fscx75\fscy75}Well, I'm gonna go spread some more holiday cheer. You're amazing!

110
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,390
无牙 下来 伙计 我有东西给你
{\fscx75\fscy75}Toothless! Come on down, bud! I got something for you.

111
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,110
你觉得如何? 嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75}What do you think of that? Yeah.

112
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,580
你能不能安定下来啊
{\fscx75\fscy75}Would you just settle down!

113
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,610
无牙 拜托 伙计 让我把这给你装上
{\fscx75\fscy75}Toothless, come on, bud. Let me get this on you.

114
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,170
对 你会喜欢这玩意的
{\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah. You are going to love this.

115
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,140
好了
{\fscx75\fscy75}OK.

116
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,210
不 不 不 无牙 停下 求你了 等等 无牙 求你了
{\fscx75\fscy75}No, no, no! Toothless, stop! Please, wait! Toothless, please!

117
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,210
好了 看到没? 明白了吧?
{\fscx75\fscy75}There you go. See? Got it?

118
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,190
无牙 哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}Toothless... Whoa!

119
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,320
无牙
{\fscx75\fscy75}Toothless!

120
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,640
我就知道你会回来
{\fscx75\fscy75}I knew you'd come back!

121
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,840
哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}Whoa!

122
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,180
早上好 儿子
{\fscx75\fscy75}Morning, son.

123
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,750
嘿 爸爸
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, Dad.

124
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,540
很高兴看到你起床了 我在找你的头盔
{\fscx75\fscy75}Glad you're up. I was looking for your helmet.

125
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,720
我的…我的头盔?
{\fscx75\fscy75}My... my helmet?

126
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,410
欧丁神需要一个地方给你塞好吃的
{\fscx75\fscy75}Odin needs a place to put your goodies.

127
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,660
对 我会…找找看的
{\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah, right, I'll... get on that.

128
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,090
真是棒极了
{\fscx75\fscy75}Great.

129
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,810
等等
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hold on.

130
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,570
等等 好了 拜托
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hold on. All right, come on.

131
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,240
你在想什么? 别想了
{\fscx75\fscy75}What's on your mind? Out with it.

132
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,720
已经三天了 爸爸
{\fscx75\fscy75}It's been three days, Dad.

133
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,360
我只是在想 无牙这时会回来的
{\fscx75\fscy75}I just thought Toothless would be back by now.

134
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,430
我可以肯定它正和其它龙在一起
{\fscx75\fscy75}I'm sure he's with the other dragons.

135
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,950
嗯 我希望我也可以这么肯定
{\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah? I wish I could be that sure.

136
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,630
听着 我知道这就像是每年的这个时候失去了你所爱的人
{\fscx75\fscy75}Listen, I know what it's like to miss someone you love this time of year.

137
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,070
但我们能为他们不能留在这过节做些什么呢
{\fscx75\fscy75}But what do we do when they can't be here for the holiday?

138
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,970
我们应该为它们而庆贺
{\fscx75\fscy75}We celebrate them.

139
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,730
我敢说这正是无牙希望你所做的
{\fscx75\fscy75}And I imagine that's exactly what Toothless would want you to do.

140
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,280
-对吗 -你说得对
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Right? - You're right.

141
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,020
那就好 现在去找你的头盔吧
{\fscx75\fscy75}Good. Now go get that helmet.

142
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,950
我们已经够诅丧的了
{\fscx75\fscy75}We've had enough disappointment around here.

143
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,050
哦 Fishlegs 你很饿吗 这些鱼足够喂一条龙了
{\fscx75\fscy75}Oh, Fishlegs, you hungry? There's enough fish there to feed a dragon.

144
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,940
一条龙 那…
{\fscx75\fscy75}A dragon! That's...

145
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,100
Meatlug
{\fscx75\fscy75}Meatlug!

146
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,590
哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}Whoa!

147
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,220
Hiccup 你要去哪?
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hiccup? Where are you going?

148
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,110
我不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75}I have no idea!

149
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,200
Meatlug 礼物怎么办
{\fscx75\fscy75}Meatlug! What about presents?

150
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,580
嘿
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hey!

151
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,550
-我不能相信他 -你不能相信他?
{\fscx75\fscy75}- I can't believe him. - You can't believe him?!

152
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,950
-你绑了你的龙 -听起来我很卑鄙
{\fscx75\fscy75}- You kidnapped your dragon! - That makes it sound so mean.

153
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,390
-嘿 大家… -当它一被释放
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Hey, guys... - He flew away the second

154
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,860
-它就立马飞走了 -我72%确信
{\fscx75\fscy75}- he was unleashed! - I'm 72 percent sure

155
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,280
它想留在这
{\fscx75\fscy75}he wanted to stay.

156
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,210
-伙计们 -哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Guys! - Whoa!

157
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,670
Meatlug吐了一堆石头在这
{\fscx75\fscy75}Meatlug barfed up a pile of rocks.

158
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,370
你个白痴 这不是石头 你的龙生蛋了
{\fscx75\fscy75}You're such an idiot. Those aren't rocks. Your dragon laid eggs!

159
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,970
嘿 等等 我知道龙为什么要离开了
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, wait. I bet that's why the dragons left.

160
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,190
-去生蛋繁衍 -但公龙又不会生蛋
{\fscx75\fscy75}- To lay their eggs. - But boy dragons don't lay eggs.

161
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,260
你的公龙其实是条母龙
{\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah, your boy dragon is a girl dragon.

162
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,730
好吧 这正好解释了一些事情
{\fscx75\fscy75}OK! That actually explains a few things.

163
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,500
嘿 每个人都失去了他们的龙 对吧
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hey! Everyone's missing their dragons, right?

164
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,950
-又来了 -我想到了一个主意
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Here it comes. - I've got an idea.

165
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,460
这将会成为另一种新的Snoggletog节传统
{\fscx75\fscy75}It'll be another new Snoggletog tradition.

166
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,710
这主意实在太赞了
{\fscx75\fscy75}This is gonna be so good!

167
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,370
Meatlug 你要带我去哪?
{\fscx75\fscy75}Meatlug, where are you taking me?

168
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,390
你们来这里是为了繁衍后代
{\fscx75\fscy75}You guys come here to have babies.

169
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,710
哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}Whoa.

170
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,410
嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hmm.

171
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,060
噢
{\fscx75\fscy75}Aww.

172
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,950
哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}Wow!

173
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,940
嘿 看这里 你落了一个
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, look over here. You missed one.

174
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,770
哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}Whoa!

175
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,130
天啊 它们不在博克岛孵化真是一件好事
{\fscx75\fscy75}Man, it's a good thing those don't hatch on Berk.

176
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,929
-这难道不是一个很棒的主意吗? -嗯哼
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Wasn't this a great idea? - Uh-huh!

177
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,140
每个人都会感到非常惊喜
{\fscx75\fscy75}Everyone is gonna be so surprised!

178
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,360
嗷
{\fscx75\fscy75}Ow!

179
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,330
真是惊喜啊
{\fscx75\fscy75}Surprise!

180
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,700
嗷
{\fscx75\fscy75}Aww!

181
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,170
龙蛋爆炸了?
{\fscx75\fscy75}The eggs explode?

182
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,510
龙蛋爆炸了
{\fscx75\fscy75}The eggs explode!

183
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,730
对不起
{\fscx75\fscy75}Sorry!

184
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,700
对不起
{\fscx75\fscy75}Sorry!

185
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,890
救救我们
{\fscx75\fscy75}Save us!

186
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,330
-赞 -哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Awesome! - Wow!

187
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,070
这仍然是你最棒的主意
{\fscx75\fscy75}This is your best idea yet.

188
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,689
雷神又搞什么鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75}What in Thor's name is going on?!

189
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,730
龙蛋爆炸了
{\fscx75\fscy75}The eggs explode.

190
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
无牙
{\fscx75\fscy75}Toothless!

191
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,330
无牙
{\fscx75\fscy75}Toothless?

192
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,270
来吧 无牙 你在哪里
{\fscx75\fscy75}Come on, Toothless, where are you?

193
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,980
Hookfang
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hookfang!

194
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,530
Stormfly
{\fscx75\fscy75}Stormfly.

195
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:43,110
哦 你们都不知道我看到你们有多开心
{\fscx75\fscy75}Oh! You have no idea how happy I am to see you guys.

196
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,080
你有孩子了?
{\fscx75\fscy75}And you have... babies?

197
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,250
看看你们大伙 多开心啊
{\fscx75\fscy75}Look at you guys, all happy together.

198
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,670
谁知道你们离开是为了庆祝你们自己的节日呢
{\fscx75\fscy75}Who knew you were leaving to celebrate your own sort of... holiday?

199
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,340
我也应该回去过我的节日了
{\fscx75\fscy75}I should get back to my holiday.

200
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,340
你有什么要说的吗 Hookfang
{\fscx75\fscy75}So, what do you say there, Hookfang?

201
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,180
你可以送我回家吗?
{\fscx75\fscy75}Think you can give me a ride back home?

202
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,460
当你们准备好回博克岛时我们再见面 好吗
{\fscx75\fscy75}I'll see you all back on Berk when you're good and ready. OK, gang?

203
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,750
不 不 不 不 不 我想我刚发起了一场还乡移民大行动
{\fscx75\fscy75}No, no! No, no, no! I... think I just started the return migration.

204
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,620
好吧 如果你们坚持的话
{\fscx75\fscy75}Well, if you insist.

205
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,180
来吧
{\fscx75\fscy75}Come on!

206
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,430
老兄 这行不通啊
{\fscx75\fscy75}Boy, this is never gonna work.

207
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,510
等等 我有办法了
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hold on. I've got just the thing.

208
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,930
老天 这真是一场灾难
{\fscx75\fscy75}Gobber, this is a disaster.

209
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,500
-没那么糟 -没那么糟?
{\fscx75\fscy75}- It's not so bad. - Not that bad?

210
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,860
村子被毁了 龙又离我们而去
{\fscx75\fscy75}The village is destroyed, the dragons have gone and left us...

211
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,560
让我们勇敢面对 这个节日是一个彻底的…
{\fscx75\fscy75}Let's face it. This holiday is a complete...

212
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,290
这些人在看啥呢?
{\fscx75\fscy75}What are these people looking at?

213
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,210
那是什么
{\fscx75\fscy75}What is that?

214
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,540
是Hiccup
{\fscx75\fscy75}It's Hiccup!

215
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,090
和我们的龙
{\fscx75\fscy75}And our dragons!

216
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,430
-欢迎回来 小伙子 -干得好
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Welcome back, laddie! - Good job!

217
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,500
耶 哇哇
{\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

Meatlug
{\fscx75\fscy75}Meatlug!

219

Stormfly 你回来了 哦
{\fscx75\fscy75}Stormfly! You're back! Oh!

220
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,410
还有这些龙宝宝
{\fscx75\fscy75}And there are babies!

221
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,700
-做得好 儿子 -谢谢 爸爸
{\fscx75\fscy75}- Well done, son. - Thanks, Dad.

222
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,450
大伙 带上你们的龙 去大厅
{\fscx75\fscy75}Everyone, grab your dragons! To the Great Hall!

223
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,860
我们终于有事可以庆祝了
{\fscx75\fscy75}We finally have something to celebrate.

224
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,730
这是史上最棒的节日
{\fscx75\fscy75}This is the best holiday ever!

225
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,690
谁是宝宝? 谁是可爱的宝宝?
{\fscx75\fscy75}Who's a baby? Who's a cutie baby?

226
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,710
Hiccup 我知道你一定很难过
{\fscx75\fscy75}Hiccup, I know this must be really hard for you,

227
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,320
只能眼巴巴地看着每个人和他们的龙玩
{\fscx75\fscy75}seeing everyone with their dragons.

228

{\fscx75\fscy75}Astrid, where did Toothless go?

231
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,400

{\fscx75\fscy75}Wouldn't wanna be you right now.

234

我是说 你带回了每个人的龙 除了你自己的
{\fscx75\fscy75}I mean, you brought back everyone's dragon except yours.

对 你知道吗 这一点帮助都没有
{\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah, you know, this is not helping at all.

238
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,050
坏龙 超级大坏龙
{\fscx75\fscy75}Bad dragon! Very bad dragon!

239

{\fscx75\fscy75}You scared me to death! Don't ever stay away that long again!

240
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,450

无牙 你把这玩意拿出来干嘛 你再也不需要它了
{\fscx75\fscy75}Toothless, what'd you pull this out for? You don't need this any more.

251
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,910

{\fscx75\fscy75}Toothless! Stop! What are you doing?!

255

{\fscx75\fscy75}Winter in Berk lasts most of the year.

{\fscx75\fscy75}And the only real comforts against the cold

258
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,410
