1
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,265
太初有道， In the beginning, the Word already existed.

2
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,685
道与　神魂在， The Word was with God...

3
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,564
道就是  神.(1:1) and the Word was God.

4
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:10,696
这道太初与　神魂在。(1:2) From the very beginning,  the Word was with God.

5
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,908
万物是藉着他造的； Through him God made all things.

6
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:19,288
凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着他造的。(1:3) Not one thing in all creation  was made without him.

7
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,749
生命在他里头， The Word was the source of life...

8
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,669
这生命就是?的光。(1:4) and this life brought light to people.

9
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,214
光照在黑暗里， The light shines in the darkness...

10
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,427
黑暗?不接受光。(1:5) and the darkness has never put it out.

11
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,827
有一个?，是从　神那里差来的， God sent his messenger...

12
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,787
名叫约翰。(1:6) a man named John...

13
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,790
这?来，为要作见证，就是为光作见证， who came to tell people about the light...

14
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,294
叫众?因他可以信。(1:7) so that all should hear the message  and believe.

15
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:15,344
他不是那光，乃是要为光作见证。(1:8) He himself was not the light.  He came to tell about the light.

16
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,597
那光是真光， This was the real light...

17
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:24,019
照亮一?生在世上的?。(1:9) the light that comes into the world  and shines on all people.

18
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,784
他在世界， The Word was in the world...

19
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,161
世界也是藉着他造的， and though God made the world  through him...

20
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,789
世界?不?识他。(1:10) yet the world did not recognize him.

21
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,510
他到自己的地方来， He came to his own country...

22
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,304
自己的?倒不接待他。(1:11) but his own people did not receive him.

23
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,392
凡接待他的，就是信他名的?， Some, however, did receive him  and believed in him...

24
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,728
他就赐他们?柄，作　神的儿女。(1:12) so he gave them the right  to become God's children.

25
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,191
这等?不是从血?生的，不是从?欲生的， They did not become God's children  by natural means...

26
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,528
也不是从?意生的， that is, by being born  as the children of a human father.

27
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,573
乃是从　神生的。 God himself...

28
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,783
乃是从　神生的。(1:13) was their father.

29
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,874
道成了?身， The Word became a human being...

30
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,005
住在我们中间，充充满满地有恩典，有真理。 and full of grace and truth, lived among us.

31
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,301
我们也见过他的?光， We saw his glory...

32
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,929
正是父独生子的?光。(1:14) the glory which he received  as the Father's only Son.

33
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,059
约翰为他作见证，喊着说： John spoke about him.

34
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:50,564
“这就是我曾说： This is the one  I was talking about when I said:

35
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,691
‘那在我以后来的， "He comes after me...

36
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,737
反成了在我以?的， "but he is greater than I am...

37
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,949
因他本来在我以?。’”(1:15) "because he existed before I was born!"

38
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,623
从他丰满的恩典里，我们都领受了，  Out of the fullness of his grace,  he has blessed us all...

39
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,626
而?恩上加恩。(1:16) giving us one blessing after another.

40
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,046
律法本是藉着摩西传的， God gave the Law through Moses...

41
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,465
恩典和真理 but grace and truth...

42
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,592
都是批耶稣基督来的。(1:17) came through Jesus Christ.

43
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,389
从来没有?看见　神， No one has ever seen God.

44
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,768
只有在父怀里的独生子 The only Son, who is the same as God...

45
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,020
只有在父怀里的独生子 and is at the Father's side...

46
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,481
将他表明出来。(1:18) he has made him known.

47
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:40,197
(约翰所作的见证记在下面：)漠太?从耶路?冷差祭司和利未?到约翰那里， The Jewish authorities in Jerusalem  sent some priests and Levites to John.

48
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,115
问他说：“你是谁？” (1:19) Who are you?

49
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,453
他就明说，并不隐瞒；明说：  John did not refuse to answer,  but spoke out openly and clearly.

50
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,501
“我不是基督。”(1:20) 他们又问他说：“这样，你是谁呢？ -I am not the Messiah.  -Who are you then?

51
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,336
是以利亚吗？”他说：“我不是。” -Are you Elijah?  -No, I'm not.

52
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,171
“是那先知吗？”他回答说：“不是。”(1:21) -Are you the Prophet?  -No.

53
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,965
于是他们说：“你到底是谁？ Then tell us who you are.

54
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,551
叫我们好回覆差我们来的?。 We have to take an answer back  to those who sent us.

55
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,928
你自己说，你是谁？” (1:22) What do you say about yourself?

56
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,139
他说： John answered  by quoting the prophet, Isaiah.

57
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:10,227
“我就是那在旷野有?声喊着说： "I am the voice of someone  shouting in the desert:

58
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:14,857
‘囊直主的道路’，正?先知以?亚所说的。”(1:23)  "'Make a straight path  for the Lord to travel!"'

59
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,953
那些?是法利??差来的（注：或作“那差来的是法利??”）。　 (1:24) 他们就问他说： The messengers, who had been sent  by the Pharisees, then asked John:

60
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,165
“你既不是基督，不是以利亚，也不是那先知， If you are not the Messiah,  nor Elijah, nor the Prophet...

61
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:35,586
为什么施洗呢？” (1:25) why do you baptize?

62
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,299
约翰回答说：“我是用水施洗， I baptize with water.

63
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,596
但有一位站在你们中间，是你们不?识的，(1:26) But among you  stands the one you do not know.

64
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,931
就是那在我以后来的， He is coming after me.

65
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,893
我给他解鞋带也不配。”  But I am not good enough...

66
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,312
我给他解鞋带也不配。” (1:27) even to untie his sandals.

67
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,578
这是在约旦河外伯大尼（注：有古卷作“伯大巴喇”）， All this happened in Bethany,  on the east side of the Jordan River...

68
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,538
约翰施洗的地方作的见证。 (1:28) where John was baptizing.

69
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,467
次?，约翰看见耶稣来到他那里， The next day,  John saw Jesus coming to him.

70
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,310
就说：“看哪，　神的羔羊， There is the Lamb of God...

71
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,730
除?（注：或作“背负”）世?罪孽的。 (1:29) who takes away the sin of the world.

72
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,660
这就是我曾说 This is the one I was talking about  when I said:

73
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,912
‘有一位在我以后来， "A man is coming after me...

74
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:56,625
反成了在我以?的，因他本来在我以?。’(1:30) "but he is greater than I am,  because he existed before I was born."

75
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,630
我先?不?识他， I did not know who he would be.

76
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,260
?今我来用水施洗， But I came baptizing with water...

77
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,638
为要叫他显明给以色列?。” (1:31) in order to make him known  to the people of Israel.

78
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,599
约翰又作见证说： And John gave this testimony:

79
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:17,229
“我曾看见圣灵仿佛鸽子从天降下，住在他的身上。 (1:32) I saw the Spirit come down,  like a dove from heaven, and stay on him.

80
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:23,569
我先?不?识他，只是那 I still did not know that he was the one.  But God...

81
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,614
差我来用水施洗的，对我说： who sent me to baptize with water,  had said to me:

82
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,826
‘你看见圣灵降下来，住在谁的身上， "You will see the Spirit come down  and stay on a man.

83
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:35,497
谁就是用圣灵施洗的。’ (1:33) "He is the one  who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. "

84
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,793
我看见了，就证明 I have seen it, and I tell you...

85
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:43,881
这是　神的儿子。” (1:34) that he is the Son of God.

86
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:55,142
再次?，约翰魂两个门徒站在那里。 (1:35) The next day, John was standing there  again with two of his disciples...

87
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,936
他见耶稣行走， when he saw Jesus walking by.

88
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,982
就说：“看哪，这是　神的羔羊!” (1:36) There is the Lamb of God.

89
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:06,320
两个门徒听见他的话， The two disciples heard him say this...

90
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,405
就跟从了耶稣。(1:37) and went with Jesus.

91
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,220
耶稣转过身来，看见他们跟着， Jesus turned, saw them following him.

92
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,807
就问他们说：“你们要什么？ What are you looking for?

93
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,269
”他们说：“拉比（“拉比”翻出来就是“夫子”），在哪里住？”  Where do you live, Rabbi?

94
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,314
”他们说：“拉比（“拉比”翻出来就是“夫子”），在哪里住？” (1:38) This word means "teacher. "

95
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,692
耶稣说：“你们来看。” Come and see.

96
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,364
他们就?看他在哪里住，这一天便与他魂住。那时约有申正了。 It was then about 4.:00 in the afternoon...

97
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,200
他们就?看他在哪里住，这一天便与他魂住。那时约有申正了。 so they went with him  and saw where he lived...

98
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,619
他们就?看他在哪里住，这一天便与他魂住。那时约有申正了。(1:39) and spent the rest of that day with him.

99
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,707
听见约翰的话，跟从耶稣的那两个?， One of them was Andrew...

100
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,459
一个是西门彼得的兄弟安得烈。(1:40) Simon Peter's brother.

101
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,007
他先找着自己的哥哥西门， At once, he found his brother Simon.

102
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,887
对他说：“我们遇见弥?亚了 We have found the Messiah.

103
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,390
（“弥?亚”翻出来就是“基督”）！” (1:41) This word means "Christ. "

104
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,891
Come.

105
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,031
于是领他?见耶稣。 Then he took Simon to Jesus.

106
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,586
耶稣看着他说： Jesus looked at him.

107
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,430
“你是约翰的儿子西门（注：“约翰”马太16章17节称“约拿”）， Your name is Simon, son of John...

108
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,267
你要称为矶法 but you will be called Cephas.

109
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,771
（“矶法”翻出来就是“彼得”）。” (1:42) This is the same as Peter,  and means "a rock. "

110
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:17,868
又次?，耶稣想要往加利利?， The next day,  Jesus decided to go to Galilee.

111
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,627
遇见腓力， He found Philip...

112
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,299
就对他说： and said to him.:

113
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,634
“来，跟从我吧!” (1:43) Come with me.

114
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:38,889
这腓力是伯?大?，和安得烈、彼得魂城。 (1:44) Philip was from Bethsaida,  the town where Andrew and Peter lived.

115
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,109
腓力找着拿但业， Philip found Nathanael.

116
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,532
对他说：“摩西在律法上所写的 We have found the one whom  Moses wrote about in the Book of the Law...

117
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,700
和众先知所记的那一位，我们遇见了， and whom the prophets also wrote about.

118
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,245
就是约瑟的儿子拿?勒?耶稣。” (1:45) He is Jesus, son of Joseph, from Nazareth.

119
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,915
拿但业对他说：“拿?勒还能出什么好的吗？”腓力说：“你来看！” (1:46) -Can anything good come from Nazareth?  -Come and see.

120
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,151
耶稣看见拿但业来，就指着他说： When Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him,  he said about him:

121
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,154
“看哪，这是个真以色列?， "Here is a real Israelite. "

122
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,657
他心里是没有诡诈的。” (1:47) There is nothing false in him.

123
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,619
拿但业对耶稣说：“你从哪里知道我呢？” How do you know me?

124
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:46,373
耶稣回答说：“腓力还没有招呼你，你在无花果树底下，我就看见你了。” (1:48) I saw you when you were under the fig tree  before Philip called you.

125
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,078
拿但业说：“拉比， Teacher...

126
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,791
你是　神的儿子， you are the Son of God.

127
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,338
你是以色列的王！” (1:49) You are the King of Israel.

128
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:38,884
耶稣对他说：“因为我说在无花果树底下看见你，你就信吗？ Do you believe just because I told you  I saw you when you were under the fig tree?

129
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,845
你将要看见比这更大的事。” (1:50) You will see much greater things than this.

130
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,139
又说：“我实实在在的告诉你们， I am telling you the truth.

131
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,183
你们将要看见天开了， You will see heaven open...

132
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,229
神的使者上?下来在?子身上。” (1:51) and God's angels going up  and coming down on the Son of Man.

133
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:57,528
第??，在加利利的迦拿有??的筵席， Two days later, there was a wedding  in the town of Cana in Galilee.

134
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,136
耶稣的母?在那里。 (2:1) Jesus' mother was there...

135
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:28,517
耶稣和他的门徒也被??赴席。(2:2) and Jesus and his disciples  had also been invited to the wedding.

136
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,325
酒用尽了， When the wine had given out...

137
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,579
耶稣的母?对他说：“他们没有酒了。” (2:3) Jesus' mother said to him,  "They are out of wine. "

138
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,164
耶稣说：“母?（注：原文作“妇?”）， Madam...

139
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,959
我与你有什么相干？ what do you have to do with this?

140
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,880
我的时候还没有到。” (2:4) My time has not yet come.

141
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,512
他母?对用?说：“他告诉你们什么，你们就做什么。”　 (2:5) Do whatever he tells you.

142
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,562
照漠太?洁净的规矩， The Jews have rules about ritual washing...

143
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,732
有六口石缸摆在那里， and for this purpose,  six stone water jars were there...

144
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,861
每口可以盛两?桶水。 (2:6) each one large enough  to hold between 20 and 30 gallons.

145
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,991
耶稣对用?说：“把缸倒满了水。” Fill these jars with water.

146
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,547
他们就倒满了，直到缸口。(2:7) They filled them to the brim.

147
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:44,968
耶稣又说：“现在可以舀出来，送给管筵席的。” Now draw some water out,  and take it to the man in charge of the feast.

148
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:14,623
他们就送了?。(2:8) They took him the water,  which now had turned into wine...

149
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,750
管筵席的尝了那水变的酒， and he tasted it.

150
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,797
并不知道是哪里来的， He did not know  where this wine had come from...

151
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,717
只有舀水的用?知道。 but, of course, the servants  who had drawn out the water knew.

152
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,762
管筵席的便叫新郎来，(2:9) So he called the bridegroom.

153
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,685
对他说：“?都是先摆上好酒，等客喝足了， Everyone else serves the best wine first,  and after the guests have drunk a lot...

154
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:39,690
才摆上次的；你倒把好酒留到?今！” (2:10) he serves the ordinary wine.  But you have kept the best wine until now.

155
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,504
这是耶稣所行的头一件神?，是在加利利的迦拿行的， Jesus performed this first miracle  in Cana in Galilee.

156
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:08,010
显出他的?耀来，他的门徒就信他了。(2:11) There he revealed his glory,  and his disciples believed in him.

157
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:12,931
这事以后，耶稣与他的母?、弟兄和门徒 After this, Jesus and his mother, brothers,  and disciples...

158
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,643
都下迦百农?，在那里住了不多几?。 (2:12) went to Capernaum  and stayed there a few days.

159
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:31,742
漠太?的逾越节近了，耶稣就上耶路?冷?。　(2:13) It was almost time for the Passover Festival,  so Jesus went to Jerusalem.

160
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,937
看见殿里 There, in the Temple...

161
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:03,232
有卖牛、羊、鸽子的， he found people selling cattle,  sheep and pigeons...

162
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,193
并有兑换银?的?坐在那里。(2:14) and also the moneychangers  sitting at their tables.

163
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:47,609
耶稣就拿绳子做成鞭子， So he made a whip from cords and  drove all the animals out of the Temple...

164
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:50,028
把牛羊都赶出殿?， both the sheep and the cattle.

165
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,469
倒出兑换银?之?的银?，推翻他们的桌子。 He overturned the tables  of the moneychangers...

166
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,680
倒出兑换银?之?的银?，推翻他们的桌子。(2:15) and scattered their coins.

167
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,228
又对卖鸽子的说： And he ordered those who sold pigeons:

168
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:24,980
“把这些东西拿?！ Take them out of here!

169
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,282
不要将我父的殿当作买卖的地方。” (2:16) Stop making my Father's house  a marketplace!

170
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,787
他的门徒就想?经上记着说： His disciples remembered  that the scripture says:

171
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:45,250
“我为你的殿，心里焦急，?魂火烧。” (2:17) "My devotion to your house, O God,  burns in me like a fire. "

172
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,712
因此漠太?问他说： The Jewish authorities came back at him  with a question:

173
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,508
“你既做这些事，还显什么神?给我们看呢？” (2:18) What miracle can you perform to show us  that you have the right to do this?

174
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:58,722
耶稣回答说：“你们拆毁这殿，我??内要再建立?来。” (2:19) Tear down this temple,  and in three days I will build it again.

175
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:02,309
漠太?便说：“这殿是四十六年才造成的，你??内就再建立?来吗？” Are you going to build it again  in three days?

176
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:06,688
漠太?便说：“这殿是四十六年才造成的，你??内就再建立?来吗？” (2:20) It has taken 46 years to build this temple.

177
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,983
但耶稣这话， But the temple Jesus was speaking about...

178
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,777
是以他的身伐为殿。 (2:21) was his body.

179
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,955
所以到他从死里复活以后， So when he was raised from death...

180
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,166
门徒就想?他说过这话， his disciples remembered  that he had said this...

181
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:30,587
便信了圣经和耶稣所说的。(2:22) and they believed the scripture,  and what Jesus had said.

182
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,975
当耶稣在耶路?冷过逾越节的时候， While Jesus was in Jerusalem  during the Passover Festival...

183
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:46,937
有许多?看见他所行的神?，就信了他的名。(2:23)  many believed in him  as they saw the miracles he performed.

184
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,942
耶稣?不将自己交托他们，因为他知道万?； (2:24) But Jesus did not trust himself to them,  because he knew them all.

185
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,946
也用不着谁见证?怎样， There was no need for anyone  to tell him about them...

186
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,199
因他知道?心里所存的。(2:25) because he himself knew  what was in their hearts.

187
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,205
有一个法利??，名叫尼哥德慕， There was a Jewish leader  named Nicodemus...

188
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,833
是漠太?的官。 (3:1) who belonged to the party of the Pharisees.

189
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,170
这?夜里来见耶稣， One night, he went to Jesus.

190
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,716
说：“拉比， Rabbi, we know...

191
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,052
我们知道你是批　神那里来作师傅的， that you are a teacher sent by God.

192
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:24,266
因为你所行的神?，?没有　神魂在，无?能行。” (3:2) No one could perform the miracles  you are doing, unless God were with him.

193
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:27,102
耶稣回答说：“我实实在在地告诉你： I am telling you the truth.

194
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,731
??不重生， No one can see the kingdom of God...

195
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,525
就不能见　神的国。” (3:3) without being born again.

196
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,154
尼哥德慕说：“?已经老了，?何能重生呢？ How can a grown man be born again?

197
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,826
?能再进母腹生出来吗？” (3:4) He certainly cannot enter his mother's womb  and be born a second time.

198
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,995
耶稣说：“我实实在在地告诉你： I am telling you the truth.

199
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:50,125
??不是从水和圣灵生的，就不能进　神的国。(3:5) No one can enter the kingdom of God  without being born of water and the Spirit.

200
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:53,253
从?身生的，就是?身； A person is born physically  of human parents...

201
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,590
从灵生的，就是灵。 (3:6) but is born spiritually of the Spirit.

202
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:06,725
我说‘你们必须重生’，你不要以为希?。(3:7) Do not be surprised because I tell you  that you must all be born again.

203
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,855
风随着意思吹， The wind blows wherever it wishes.

204
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,442
你听见风的响声， You hear the sound it makes...

205
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:19,196
?不晓得从哪里来，往哪里?； but you do not know where it comes from,  or where it is going.

206
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,157
凡从圣灵生的，也是?此。” (3:8) It is like that with everyone  who is born of the Spirit.

207
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:23,826
尼哥德慕问他说：“怎能有这事呢？” (3:9) How can this be?

208
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,622
耶稣回答说：“你是以色列?的先生， You are a great teacher in Israel...

209
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,958
还不明白这事吗？ (3:10) and you don't know this?

210
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,879
我实实在在地告诉你： I am telling you the truth.

211
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,843
我们所说的，是我们知道的；我们所见证的，是我们见过的； We speak of what we know,  and report what we have seen.

212
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:44,054
你们?不领受我们的见证。 (3:11) Yet none of you is willing  to accept our message.

213
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:50,894
我对你们说地上的事，你们尚?不信； You do not believe me when I tell you  about the things of this world.

214
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,695
?说天上的事，?何能信呢？(3:12) How will you ever believe me, then,  when I tell you about the things of heaven?

215
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:03,574
除了从天降下?旧在天的?子， And no one has ever gone up to heaven...

216
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:07,286
没有?升过天。 (3:13) except the Son of Man,  who came down from heaven.

217
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:14,751
摩西在旷野怎样举蛇， As Moses lifted up the bronze snake  on a pole in the desert...

218
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,713
?子也必照样被举?来， (3:14) in the same way,  the Son of Man must be lifted up...

219
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:21,508
叫一?信他的都得永生（注：或作“叫一?信的?在他里面得永生”）。 (3:15) so that everyone who believes in him  may have eternal life.

220
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:25,637
神爱世?，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们， For God loved the world so much  that He gave his only Son...

221
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:31,143
叫一?信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。 (3:16) so that everyone who believes in him  may not die, but have eternal life.

222
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:37,733
因为　神差他的儿子降世，不是要定世?的罪（注：或作“诀判世? ”。下魂），乃是要叫世?因他得救。 (3:17) For God did not send his Son into the world  to be its judge, but to be its savior.

223
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,820
信他的?，不被定罪； Those who believe in the Son  are not judged.

224
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:46,158
不信的?，罪已经定了， But those who do not believe  have already been judged...

225
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:50,537
因为他不信　神独生子的名。  because they have not believed  in God's only Son.

226
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:55,626
因为他不信　神独生子的名。 (3:18) This is how the judgment works:

227
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,086
光来到世间， The light has come into the world...

228
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,298
世?因自己的行为是恶的， but people love the darkness  rather than the light...

229
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,509
不爱光倒爱黑暗，定他们的罪就是在此。(3:19) because their deeds are evil.

230
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:08,138
凡作恶的便恨光，并不来就光， Those who do evil things hate the light  and will not come to the light...

231
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:12,434
恐怕他的行为受责备； (3:20) because they do not want their evil deed  to be shown up.

232
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,230
但行真理的必来就光， But those who do what is true  come to the light...

233
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:21,068
要显明他所行的是靠　神而行。” (3:21) in order that the light may show  that what they did was in obedience to God.

234
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:28,200
这事以后，耶稣和门徒到了漠太地， After this, Jesus and his disciples  went to the province of Judaea...

235
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:31,411
在那里居住施洗。(3:22) where he spent some time with them,  and baptized.

236
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,790
约翰在靠近?冷的 John also was baptizing in Aenon...

237
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,750
哀嫩也施洗， not far from Salim...

238
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:39,419
因为那里水多， because there was plenty of water  in that place.

239
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:42,756
众?都?受洗。 (3:23) People were going to him,  and he was baptizing them.

240
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,300
那时约翰还没有下在监里 。 (3:24) This was before John  had been put in prison.

241
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,679
约翰的门徒和一个漠太?辩论 Some of John's disciples  began arguing with a Jew...

242
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,139
洁净的礼，(3:25) about the matter of ritual washing.

243
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:53,559
就来见约翰说：“拉比， Teacher...

244
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:57,604
从?魂你在约旦河外、 you remember the man who was with you  on the east side of Jordan...

245
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,439
你所见证的那位， the one you spoke about?

246
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:02,985
现在施洗，众?都往他那里?了。” (3:26) He is baptizing now,  and everyone's going to him.

247
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:07,072
约翰说：“?不是从天上赐的，?就不能得什么。 (3:27) No one can have anything  unless God gives it.

248
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,075
我曾说‘我不是基督，是奉差?在他?面的’，你们自己可以给我作见证。  You yourselves are my witnesses,  that I said:

249
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:13,954
我曾说‘我不是基督，是奉差?在他?面的’，你们自己可以给我作见证。 (3:28) "I am not the Messiah,  but I have been sent ahead of him."

250
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:17,124
?新妇的就是新郎， The bridegroom is the one to whom  the bride belongs.

251
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,126
新郎的朋友  but the bridegroom's friend...

252
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:22,921
站着听见新郎的声音就甚喜乐， who stands by and listens, is glad  when he hears the bridegroom's voice.

253
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:25,966
故此我这喜乐满足了。(3:29) This is how my own happiness  is made complete.

254
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,763
他必兴旺，我必衰微。(3:30) He must become more important  while I become less important.

255
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:36,476
从天上来的，是在万有之上； He who comes from above  is greater than all.

256
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,979
从地上来的，是属乎地， He who is from the earth  belongs to the earth...

257
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,939
他所说的也是属乎地。 and speaks about earthly matters...

258
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,401
从天上来的是在万有之上。(3:31) but he who comes from heaven is above all.

259
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:47,321
他将所见所闻的见证出来， He tells what he has seen and heard...

260
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,281
只是没有?领受他的见证。 (3:32) yet no one accepts his message.

261
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,700
那领受他见证的，  But whoever accepts his message...

262
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:54,828
就印上印，证明　神是真的。 (3:33) confirms by this that God is truthful.

263
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,916
神所差来的，就说　神的话， The one whom God has sent  speaks God's words...

264
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:03,003
因为　神赐圣灵给他，是没有限量的。 (3:34) because God gives him  the fullness of his Spirit.

265
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:07,674
父爱子，已将万有交在他手里。(3:35) The Father loves his Son,  and has put everything in his power.

266
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:10,719
信子的?有永生； Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life.

267
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:14,223
不信子的?得不着永生（注：原文作“不得见永生 ”），　 Whoever disobeys the Son  will not have life...

268
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,684
神的震怒常在他身上。” (3:36) but will remain under God's punishment.

269
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:30,239
主知道法利??听见他收门徒施洗比约翰还多 (4:1) The Pharisees heard that Jesus was winning  and baptizing more disciples than John.

270
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:35,202
（?实不是耶稣?自施洗，乃是他的门徒施洗。） (4:2) Actually, Jesus himself did not  baptize anyone. Only his disciples did.

271
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:38,705
So when Jesus heard what was being said...

272
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:41,708
他就离了漠太，又往加利利?。 (4:3) he left Judea and went back to Galilee.

273
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:44,920
必须经过?马利亚， (4:4) On his way there,  he had to go through Samaria.

274
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:50,801
于是到了?马利亚的一座城，名叫叙加， In Samaria,  he came to a town named Sychar...

275
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:56,390
靠近雅各给他儿子约瑟的那块地。 (4:5) which was not far from the field  that Jacob had given to his son, Joseph.

276
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,520
在那里有雅各井。 Jacob's well was there...

277
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,689
耶稣因走路困乏，就坐在井旁。 and Jesus, tired out by the trip...

278
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,649
所以他坐在井边休息. sat down by the well.

279
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:07,651
那时约有午正。(4:6) It was about noon.

280
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:28,630
有一个?马利亚的妇?来打水， A Samaritan woman  came to draw some water.

281
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:35,179
耶稣对她说：“?你给我水喝。”(4:7) Give me a drink of water.

282
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:38,223
那时门徒进城买食物?了。(4:8) His disciples had gone into town  to buy food.

283
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:40,976
?马利亚的妇?对他说：“你既是漠太?， You're a Jew, and I'm a Samaritan.

284
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,355
怎么向我一个?马利亚妇?要水喝呢？” So how can you ask me for a drink?

285
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:49,109
原来漠太?和?马利亚?没有来往。 (4:9) Jews will not use the same cups and bowls  that Samaritans use.

286
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,652
耶稣回答说：“你?知道　神的恩赐 If you only knew what God gives...

287
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:54,281
和对你说‘给我水喝’的是谁，你必早?他，  and who it is that is asking you for a drink,  you would ask him...

288
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,909
他也必早给了你活水。”(4:10) and he would give you life-giving water.

289
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,620
妇?说：“先生，没有打水的?具，井又深， Sir, you don't have a bucket,  and the well is deep.

290
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,831
你从哪里得活水呢？ (4:11) Where would you get that life-giving water?

291
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:05,834
我们的祖宗雅各将这井留给我们， It was our ancestor Jacob  who gave us this well.

292
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:09,463
他自己和儿子并牲畜也都喝这井里的水， He and his children and his flocks  all drank from it.

293
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,674
难道你比他还大吗？” (4:12) You don't claim to be greater than Jacob,  do you?

294
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:16,136
耶稣回答说：“凡喝这水的，还要再渴； (4:13) Those who drink this water  will get thirsty again...

295
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:20,140
??喝我所赐的水，就永远不渴。 but those who drink the water  that I give them will never be thirsty again.

296
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:23,477
我所赐的水要在他里头成为?源， The water that I will give them  will become, in them, a spring...

297
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,314
直涌到永生。” (4:14) which will provide them with  life-giving water, and give them eternal life.

298
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:31,360
妇?说：“先生，?把这水赐给我，叫我不渴， Sir, give me that water.  Then I will never be thirsty again...

299
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:34,363
也不用来这么远打水。” (4:15) nor will I have to come here to draw water.

300
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:39,493
耶稣说：“你?叫你丈夫也到这里来。” (4:16) Go and call your husband, and come back.

301
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,497
妇?说：“我没有丈夫。” I don't have a husband.

302
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:46,083
耶稣说：“你说没有丈夫，是不错的。(4:17) You're right when you say  you don't have a husband.

303
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,626
你已经有五个丈夫， You've been married to five men...

304
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:51,171
你现在有的，并不是你的丈夫， and the man you live with now  is not really your husband.

305
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,632
你这话是真的。” (4:18) You've told me the truth.

306
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:56,468
妇?说：“先生，我看出你是先知。(4:19) I see you are a prophet, sir.

307
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,848
我们的祖宗在这山上礼拜， My Samaritan ancestors worshipped God  on this mountain...

308
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:05,018
你们倒说，应当礼拜的地方是在耶路?冷。” (4:20) but you Jews say that Jerusalem is the place  where we should worship God.

309
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,020
耶稣说：“妇?，你当信我。 Believe me, woman...

310
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:11,233
时候将到，你们拜父也不在这山上， a time will come when people won't worship  the Father either on this mountain...

311
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,901
也不在耶路?冷。 (4:21) or in Jerusalem.

312
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,698
你们所拜的，你们不知道； You Samaritans do not really know  whom you worship.

313
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,783
我们所拜的，我们知道， But we Jews know whom we worship...

314
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:22,828
因为救恩是从漠太?出来的。 (4:22) because it is from the Jews  that salvation comes.

315
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:25,581
时候将到， But the time is coming...

316
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,208
?今就是了。 and is already here...

317
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:31,420
那真正拜父的，要用心灵和诚实拜他， when, by the power of God's Spirit...

318
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,007
那真正拜父的，要用心灵和诚实拜他， people will worship the Father  as he really is...

319
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:38,260
因为父要这样的?拜他。(4:23) offering him the true worship that he wants.

320
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,555
神是个灵（注：或无“个”字）， God is Spirit.

321
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,850
所以拜他的，必须用心灵和诚实拜他。” And only by the power of his Spirit...

322
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,895
所以拜他的，必须用心灵和诚实拜他。” (4:24) can people worship him as he really is.

323
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,357
妇?说：“我知道弥?亚（就是那称为基督的）要来， I know that the Messiah will come.

324
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:55,736
他来了，必将一?的事都告诉我们。” (4:25) And when he comes,  he will tell us everything.

325
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:57,988
耶稣说：“这和你说话的就是他。”  I am he.

326
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:01,158
耶稣说：“这和你说话的就是他。” (4:26) I, who am talking with you.

327
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,704
当下门徒回来， At that moment, Jesus' disciples returned...

328
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:09,791
就希?耶稣和一个妇?说话。 and they were greatly surprised  to find him talking with a woman.

329
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:13,378
只是没有?说：“你是要什么？” But none of them said to her,  "What do you want?"

330
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:16,465
或说：“你为什么和她说话？”(4:27)"  Or asked him,  "Why are you talking with her?"

331
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:21,512
那妇?就留下水罐子，往城里?，对众?说：(4:28) Then the woman left her water jar  and went back to the town.

332
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:32,022
“你们来看！有一个?将我素来所行的一?事都给我说出来了， Come and see the man who told me  everything I have ever done.

333
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,858
莫阏饩褪腔督吗？” (4:29) Could he be the Messiah?

334
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,111
众?就出城往耶稣那里?。 (4:30) So they left the town, and went to Jesus.

335
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,865
这?间，门徒对耶稣说： In the meantime,  the disciples were begging Jesus:

336
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:45,077
“拉比，?颈。” (4:31) 耶稣说：“  "Teacher, have something to eat!"  But he answered:

337
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:47,621
我有食物颈，是你们不知道的。”(4:32) I have food to eat  that you know nothing about.

338
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,290
门徒就彼此对问说： So the disciples  started asking among themselves.:

339
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,334
“莫阌?拿什么给他颈吗？”(4:33) "Could somebody have brought him food?"

340
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,962
耶稣说：“我的食物就是遵行差我来者的旨意， My food is to obey the will  of the one who sent me...

341
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,798
做成他的工。(4:34) and to finish the work he gave me to do.

342
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,844
你们?不说‘到收割的时候还有四个月’吗？ You have a saying,  "Four more months, and then the harvest."

343
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:05,681
我告诉你们：举目向田观看， But I tell you, take a good look at the fields.

344
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:10,060
庄稼已经熟了（注：原文作“发白”），可以收割了。 (4:35) The crops are now ripe  and ready to be harvested.

345
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:14,481
收割的?得工价，积蓄五谷到永生， The one who reaps the harvest is being paid  and gathers the crops for eternal life.

346
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:18,318
叫?种的和收割的一魂快乐。(4:36) So the one who plants  and the one who reaps will be glad together.

347
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:22,531
俗语说‘那??种，这?收割’，这话可见是真的。　(4:37) For the saying is true.  Someone plants, someone else reaps.

348
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:27,411
我差你们?收你们所没有劳苦的，”  I have sent you to reap a harvest  in a field where you did not work.

349
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:29,496
别?劳苦， Others worked there...

350
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:33,000
你们享受他们所劳苦的。(4:38) and you profit from their work.

351
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:37,045
那城里有好些?马利亚?信了耶稣， Many of the Samaritans in that town  believed in Jesus...

352
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:41,383
因为那妇?作见证说：“他将我素来所行的一?事都给我说出来了。” (4:39) because the woman had said,  "He told me everything I have ever done. "

353
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:46,346
于是?马利亚?来见耶稣， So when the Samaritans came to him...

354
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,390
?他在他们那里住下， they begged him to stay with them...

355
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,851
他便在那里住了两天。(4:40) and Jesus stayed there two days.

356
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:57,316
因耶稣的话，信的?就更多了。(4:41) 便对妇?说： Many more believed because of  his message, and they told the woman.:

357
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:00,527
“现在我们信，不是因为你的话， "We believe now,  not because of what you said...

358
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:03,655
是我们?自听见了， "but because we ourselves have heard him...

359
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:07,284
知道这真是救世主。”(4:42) "and we know  that he really is the Savior of the world. "

360
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:12,706
过了那两天， After spending two days there...

361
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:15,042
耶稣离了那地方，往加利利?。(4:43) Jesus left, and went to Galilee.

362
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:16,919
因为耶稣自己作过见证说： For he himself had said:

363
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:20,214
“先知在本地是没有?尊敬的。” (4:44) "Prophets are not respected  in their own country. "

364
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:29,097
到了加利利， When he arrived in Galilee,  the people there welcomed him...

365
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:32,017
加利利?既?看见他在耶路?冷过节所行的一?事，就接待他，因为他们也是上?过节。 because they had gone  to the Passover Festival in Jerusalem...

366
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,521
加利利?既?看见他在耶路?冷过节所行的一?事，就接待他，因为他们也是上?过节。 (4:45) and had seen everything that he had done  during the festival.

367
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:43,195
耶稣又到了加利利的迦拿， Then Jesus went back to Cana in Galilee...

368
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,281
就是他从?变水为酒的地方。 where he had turned the water into wine.

369
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,683
有一个大臣，他的儿子在迦百农患病。 (4:46) A government official was there,  whose son was sick in Capernaum.

370
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:19,022
他听见耶稣从漠太到了加利利， When he heard that Jesus had come  from Judea to Galilee...

371
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:20,691
就来见他， he went to him...

372
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,820
?他下?医治他的儿子， and asked him to go to Capernaum...

373
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:27,614
因为他儿子快要死了。(4:47) and heal his son, who was about to die.

374
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:36,039
耶稣就对他说：“?不看见神??事，你们总是不信。” (4:48) None of you will ever believe  unless you see miracles and wonders.

375
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:39,042
那大臣说：“先生，?你趁着我的孩子还没有死  Sir, come with me...

376
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,967
就下?。”(4:49) before my child dies.

377
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,222
耶稣对他说：“回?吧！ Go.

378
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,228
你的儿子活了。” Your son will live.

379
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:05,360
那?信耶稣所说的话，就回?了。(4:50) The man believed Jesus' words and went.

380
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:26,340
正下?的时候，他的??迎见他， On his way home,  his servants met him with the news.

381
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:37,518
说他的儿子活了。 (4:51) Your boy is going to live!

382
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,188
他就问什么时候见好的。 He asked them what time it was  when his son got better.

383
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,816
他们说：“昨?未时?就退了。” (4:52) It was 1 :00 yesterday afternoon  when the fever left him!

384
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:50,572
他便知道这正是耶稣对他说 Then the father remembered that it was  at that very hour when Jesus had told him:

385
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,701
“你儿子活了”的时候； Your son will live.

386
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:06,129
他自己和?家就都信了。 (4:53) So he and all his family believed.

387
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:09,675
这是耶稣在加利利行的第二件神?， This was the second miracle...

388
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:13,846
是他从漠太回?以后行的。 (4:54) that Jesus performed  after coming from Judea to Galilee.

389
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:22,104
这事以后，到了漠太?的一个节?，耶稣就上耶路?冷?。(5:1) After this, Jesus went to Jerusalem  for a religious festival.

390
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:27,442
在耶路?冷，靠近羊门有一个池子，希伯来话叫作毕士大， Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem,  there is a pool with five porches.

391
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:30,279
旁边有五个廊子。(5:2) In Hebrew, it is called Bethzatha.

392
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,665
里面躺着 A large crowd of sick people  were lying on the porches...

393
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:47,379
瞎眼的、?腿的、血?枯干的许多病?。（注：有古卷在此有“等候水动， (5:3) 因为有天使按时下池子搅动那水，水动之后，谁先下?，无论害什么病就?愈了。”） (5:4) the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed.

394
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:56,930
在那里有一个?，病了?十八年。(5:5) A man was there  who had been sick for 38 years.

395
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,688
耶稣看见他躺着， Jesus saw him lying there...

396
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:07,774
知道他病了许久， and he knew that the man had been sick  for such a long time.

397
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,871
就问他说：“你要?愈吗？” (5:6) Do you want to get well?

398
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:29,046
病?回答说：“先生，水动的时候，没有?把我放在池子里； Sir, I don't have anyone here to put me  in the pool when the water is stirred up.

399
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:32,925
我正?的时候，就有别?比我先下?。”(5:7) While I'm trying to get in,  someone else gets there first.

400
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:40,474
耶稣对他说：“?来， Get up.

401
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,102
拿你的?子走吧！” (5:8) Pick up your mat and walk.

402
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:12,130
那?立刻?愈， Immediately, the man got well.

403
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,194
就拿??子来 He picked up his mat...

404
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:36,029
走了。(5:9) and started walking.

405
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:00,053
那天是安息?， The day this happened was a Sabbath...

406
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:05,100
所以漠太?对那医好的?说： so the Jewish authorities  told the man who had been healed:

407
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:09,646
“今天是安息?，你拿?子是不可的！”(5:10) This is a Sabbath, and it is against our law  for you to carry your mat.

408
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,442
他?回答说：“那使我?愈的对我说：‘拿你的?子走吧!’”(5:11) The man who made me well  told me to pick up my mat and walk.

409
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:19,615
他们问他说：“对你说‘拿?子走’的是什么?？” (5:12) Who is the man who told you to do this?

410
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:24,203
那医好的?不知道是谁， But the man who had been healed  did not know who Jesus was...

411
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:28,040
因为那里的?多，耶稣已经躲开了。 (5:13) for there was a crowd in that place,  and Jesus had slipped away.

412
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:34,087
后来耶稣在殿里遇见他， Afterwards, Jesus found him in the Temple.

413
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:39,051
对他说：“你已经?愈了， You're well now...

414
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,386
不要再犯罪， so stop sinning...

415
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,097
恐怕你遭遇的更加利害。” (5:14) or something worse may happen to you.

416
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,604
那?就? Then the man left...

417
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:55,108
告诉漠太?，使他?愈的是耶稣。 (5:15) and told the Jewish authorities  that it was Jesus who had healed him.

418
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:03,617
所以漠太?逼?耶稣， So they began to persecute Jesus...

419
00:38:03,826 --> 00:38:06,703
因为他在安息?做了这事。 (5:16) because he had done this healing  on a Sabbath.

420
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:10,833
耶稣就对他们说： Jesus answered them.:

421
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:14,795
“我父做事直到?今， My Father is always working.

422
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,800
我也做事。” (5:17) And I, too, must work.

423
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:24,513
所以漠太?越发想要杀他， This saying made the Jewish authorities  all the more determined to kill him.

424
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:27,391
因他不但犯了安息?， Not only had he broken the Sabbath law...

425
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:30,310
并?称　神为他的父， but he had said  that God was his own Father...

426
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:33,564
将自己和　神当作?等。(5:18) and, in this way,  had made himself equal with God.

427
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:35,983
耶稣对他们说： So Jesus answered them:

428
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,486
“我实实在在地告诉你们： I tell you the truth!

429
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:42,990
子?着自己不能做什么， The Son can do nothing on his own!

430
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:48,453
惟有看见父所做的，子才能做；父所做的事，子也照样做。 (5:19) He does only what he sees his Father doing!  What the Father does, the Son also does.

431
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,915
父爱子， For the Father loves the Son...

432
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:55,043
将自己所做的一?事指给他看， and shows him all that he himself is doing.

433
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,923
还要将比这更大的事指给他看，叫你们希?。 (5:20) He will show him even greater things  to do than this, and you will all be amazed!

434
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:03,552
父怎样叫死??来，使他们活着， Just as the Father raises the dead  and gives them life...

435
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:06,847
子也照样随自己的意思使?活着。(5:21) in the same way,  the Son gives life to those he wants to.

436
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:09,850
父不诀判什么?， Nor does the Father himself judge anyone.

437
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,811
乃将诀判的事?交与子， (5:22) He has given his Son  the full right to judge...

438
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:16,690
叫?都尊敬子?魂尊敬父一样。 so that all will honor the Son  in the same way as they honor the Father.

439
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:21,028
不尊敬子的，就是不尊敬差子来的父。(5:23) Whoever does not honor the Son  does not honor the Father who sent him.

440
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:24,698
我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth!

441
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:27,868
那听我话、又信差我来者的， Those who hear my words  and believe in him who sent me...

442
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:29,536
就有永生， have eternal life.

443
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:33,207
不至于定罪，是已经出死?生了。(5:24) They will not be judged,  but have already passed from death to life.

444
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:35,542
我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

445
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:37,711
时候将到， The time is coming.

446
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:40,422
现在就是了， The time has already come...

447
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:43,634
死?要听见　神儿子的声音， when the dead will hear  the voice of the Son of God.

448
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:46,845
听见的?就要活了。 (5:25) And those who hear it will come to life.

449
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,057
因为父怎样在自己有生命，就赐给他儿子也照样在自己有生命， (5:26) Just as the Father is, himself,  the source of life...

450
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,685
就赐给他儿子也照样在自己有生命， (5:26) in the same way, he has made his Son  to be the source of life.

451
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:57,564
并?因为他是?子，就赐给他行诀判的?柄。 And he has given the Son the right to judge,  because he is...

452
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,399
并?因为他是?子，就赐给他行诀判的?柄。(5:27) the Son of Man!

453
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:03,904
你们不要把这事看作希?。 Do not be surprised at this.

454
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:09,701
时候要到，凡在坟墓里的，都要听见他的声音，就出来。 (5:28) The time is coming when all the dead will  hear his voice and come out of their graves.

455
00:40:09,785 --> 00:40:12,704
行善的，复活得生；作恶的，复活定罪。 (5:29) Those who have done good  will rise and live.

456
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:15,707
作恶的， And those who have done evil..

457
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:18,627
复活定罪。 (5:29) will rise and be condemned.

458
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:25,342
我?着自己不能做什么， I can do nothing on my own authority!

459
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:29,137
我怎么听见，就怎么诀判。我的诀判也是公?的， I judge only as God tells me,  so my judgment is right...

460
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:33,934
因为我不?自己的意思，只?那差我来者的意思。 (5:30) because I am not trying to do what I want,  but only what he who sent me wants!

461
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:36,687
我?为自己作见证， If I testify on my own behalf...

462
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,107
我的见证就不真；(5:31) what I say is not to be accepted  as real proof.

463
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:43,402
另有一位给我作见证， But there is someone else  who testifies on my behalf.

464
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:46,488
我也知道他给我作的见证是真的。(5:32) And I know that  what he says about me is true.

465
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:49,825
你们曾差?到约翰那里， John is the one  to whom you sent your messengers.

466
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,371
他为真理作过见证。 (5:33) ?实我所受的见证不是从?来的； And he spoke on behalf of the truth.  It is not that I must have a human witness...

467
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:57,541
?而我说这些话，为要叫你们得救。(5:34) I say this only in order that  you may be saved!

468
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:00,878
约翰是点着的明灯， John was like a lamp, burning and shining...

469
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:04,298
你们?愿暂时喜欢他的光。(5:35) and you were willing, for a while,  to enjoy his light.

470
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,383
但我有比约翰更大的见证， But I have a witness on my behalf...

471
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:09,595
但我有比约翰更大的见证， which is even greater than the witness  that John gave.

472
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:11,054
因为父交给我要我成就的事，就是我所做的事， What I do...

473
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:14,808
因为父交给我要我成就的事，就是我所做的事， that is, the deeds my Father gave me to do...

474
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:19,021
这便见证我是父所差来的。 (5:36) these speak on my behalf  and show that the Father has sent me.

475
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,691
差我来的父也为我作过见证。 And the Father who sent me  also testifies on my behalf.

476
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:26,528
你们从来没有听见他的声音，也没有看见他的形像。(5:37) You have never heard his voice  or seen his face...

477
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:28,906
你们并没有他的道存在心里， and you do not keep his message  in your hearts...

478
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:31,200
因为他所差来的，你们不信。 (5:38) for you do not believe  in the one whom he sent.

479
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:34,786
你们查考圣经（注：或作“应当查考圣经”）， You study the Scriptures,  because you think that in them...

480
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:38,707
因你们以为内中有永生；给我作见证的就是这经。(5:39) you will find eternal life!  And these very scriptures speak about me!

481
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,503
?而你们不肯到我这里来得生命。 (5:40) Yet you are not willing to come to me  in order to have life.

482
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,881
我不受从?来的?耀，(5:41) I am not looking for human praise.

483
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:49,176
但我知道， But I know what kind of people you are.

484
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:53,388
你们心里没有　神的爱。 (5:42) And I know that you have no love for God  in your hearts.

485
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:59,645
我奉我父的名来，你们并不接待我； I have come with my Father's authority,  but you have not received me.

486
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:05,234
?有别?奉自己的名来，你们倒要接待他。 (5:43) When, however, someone comes  with his own authority, you will receive him.

487
00:42:05,275 --> 00:42:08,278
你们互相受?耀， You like to receive praise  from one another...

488
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:12,324
?不?从独一之　神来的?耀， but you do not try to win praise  from the one who alone is God!

489
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:14,993
怎能信我呢？(5:44) How, then, can you believe me?

490
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:18,789
不要想我在父面?要告你们， Do not think, however, that I am the one  who will accuse you to my Father.

491
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:23,418
有一位告你们的，就是你们所仰赖的摩西。(5:45) Moses, in whom you have put your hope,  is the very one who will accuse you.

492
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:27,214
你们?果信摩西，也必信我， If you had really believed Moses,  you would've believed me...

493
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:29,341
因为他书上有指着我写的话。(5:46) because he wrote about me.

494
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:34,388
你们?不信他的书，怎能信我的话呢？”(5:47) But since you do not believe what he wrote,  how can you believe what I say?

495
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:51,822
这事以后，耶稣渡过加利利海， After this, Jesus went across Lake Galilee...

496
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:54,741
就是提比哩亚海。(6:1) or Lake Tiberias, as it is also called.

497
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:11,425
有许多?因为看见他在病?身上所行的神?， A large crowd followed him...

498
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:14,970
就跟随他。(6:2) because they had seen his miracles  of healing the sick.

499
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:50,756
耶稣上了山，和门徒一魂坐在那里。(6:3) Jesus went up a hill  and sat down with his disciples.

500
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:02,643
那时漠太?的逾越节近了。 (6:4) The time for the Passover Festival was near.

501
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:06,730
耶稣举目看见许多?来， Jesus looked around and saw  that a large crowd was coming to him.

502
00:44:20,828 --> 00:44:24,248
就对腓力说：“我们从哪里买饼叫这些?颈呢？” (6:5) Where can we buy enough food  to feed all these people?

503
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,209
他说这话是要试验腓力， He said this to test Philip.

504
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:30,462
他自己原知道要怎样行。 (6:6) Actually, he already knew what he would do.

505
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:33,006
腓力回答说：“就是二十两银子的饼，叫他们各?颈一点，也是不够的。” For everyone to have even a little...

506
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:37,719
腓力回答说：“就是二十两银子的饼，叫他们各?颈一点，也是不够的。” (6:7) it would take more than 200 silver coins  to buy enough bread.

507
00:44:42,307 --> 00:44:46,728
有一个门徒，就是西门彼得的兄弟安得烈，对耶稣说：(6:8) Another one of his disciples, Andrew,  who was Simon Peter's brother, said:

508
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:51,191
“在这里有一个孩童，带着五个大麦饼、两条话， There is a boy here who has  five loaves of barley bread and two fish.

509
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:57,156
只是分给这许多? ，还算什么呢？” (6:9) But they will certainly not be enough  for all these people.

510
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:02,661
耶稣说：“你们叫众?坐下。” Make the people sit down.

511
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:04,872
原来那地方的草多， There was a lot of grass there...

512
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:07,040
众?就坐下， so all the people sat down.

513
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:09,918
数目约有五?。(6:10) There were about 5,000 men.

514
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:22,389
耶稣拿?饼来， Jesus took the bread...

515
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:25,392
祝谢了， gave thanks to God...

516
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:43,494
就分给那坐着的?， and distributed it  to the people who were sitting there.

517
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:16,610
分话也是这样， He did the same with the fish...

518
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:28,372
都随着他们所要的。(6:11) and they all had as much as they wanted.

519
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:39,049
他们颈饱了， When they were all full,  he said to his disciples.:

520
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:41,760
耶稣对门徒说：“把剩下的零碎收拾?来， Gather the pieces left over.

521
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:45,806
免得有糟蹋的。” (6:12) Let us not waste a bit.

522
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:49,810
他们便将那五个大麦饼的零碎，就是众?颈了剩下的， So they gathered them all  and filled 12 baskets...

523
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:54,231
收拾?来，装满了十二个篮子。 (6:13) with the pieces left over from the five  barley loaves which the people had eaten.

524
00:46:56,859 --> 00:47:00,737
众?看见耶稣所行的神?， Seeing this miracle that Jesus  had performed, the people there said:

525
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:02,781
就说： "Surely this is the Prophet...

526
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:05,200
“这真是那要到世间来的先知。”(6:14) "who was to come into the wold!"

527
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,747
耶稣既知道众?要来 Jesus knew that they were about  to come and seize him...

528
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:12,708
?逼他作王， in order to make him king by force.

529
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:15,794
就独自又退到山上?了。(6:15) So he went off again to the hills by himself.

530
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:27,347
到了晚上，他的门徒下海边?，(6:16) When evening came,  Jesus' disciples went down to the lake...

531
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:28,765
上了船， got into a boat...

532
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:31,935
要过海往迦百农?。 and went back across the lake  towards Capernaum.

533
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:39,109
天已经黑了，耶稣还没有来到他们那里。(6:17) Night came on,  and Jesus still had not come to them.

534
00:47:40,486 --> 00:47:44,198
忽?狂风大作，海就翻腾?来。 (6:18) By then a strong wind was blowing  and stirring up the water.

535
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:09,014
门徒摇橹约行了十里多路， The disciples had rowed  about three or four miles...

536
00:48:10,182 --> 00:48:12,059
看见耶稣 when they saw Jesus...

537
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:14,269
在海面上走， walking on the water...

538
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:28,450
渐渐近了船， coming near the boat...

539
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:31,370
他们就害怕。 (6:19) and they were terrified.

540
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,001
耶稣对他们说：“是我， 不要怕！” Don't be afraid.

541
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:40,295
耶稣对他们说：“是我， 不要怕！”(6:20) It is I.

542
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:07,114
门徒就喜欢接他上船， Then they willingly took him into the boat...

543
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:17,291
船立时到了 and immediately the boat reached land...

544
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:19,793
他们所要?的地方。(6:21) at the place they were heading for.

545
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:26,341
第二?，站在海那边的众?， Next day, the crowd which had stayed  on the other side of the lake...

546
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:29,011
知道那里没有别的船，只有一只小船； realized that there had been  only one boat there.

547
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:32,472
又知道耶稣没有魂他的门徒上船， They knew that Jesus had not gone in it  with his disciples...

548
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:34,808
乃是门徒自己?的。 (6:22) but that they had left without him.

549
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:39,354
?而，有几只小船从提比哩亚来， Other boats, which were from Tiberias,  came to shore near the place...

550
00:49:39,438 --> 00:49:43,150
靠近主祝谢后分饼给?颈的地方。(6:23) where the crowd had eaten  the bread after the Lord had given thanks.

551
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:48,155
众?见耶稣和门徒都不在那里， When the crowd saw  that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples...

552
00:49:48,197 --> 00:49:51,950
就上了船，往迦百农?找耶稣。(6:24) they got into those boats  and went to Capernaum, looking for him.

553
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:07,799
既在海那边找着了，就对他说： When the people found Jesus on  the other side of the lake, they said to him:

554
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:10,260
“拉比，是几时到这里来的？” (6:25) "Teacher, when did you get here?"

555
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:14,181
耶稣回答说：“我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

556
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:19,520
你们找我，并不是因见了神?，乃是因颈饼得饱。  You are looking for me because  you ate the bread and had all you wanted...

557
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:22,314
你们找我，并不是因见了神?，乃是因颈饼得饱。 (6:26) not because you understood my miracles.

558
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:25,859
不要为那必坏的食物劳力， Do not work for food that spoils.

559
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:30,656
要为那存到永生的食物劳力， Instead, work for the food  that lasts for eternal life.

560
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:34,409
就是?子要赐给你们的， This is the food  the Son of Man will give you...

561
00:50:34,493 --> 00:50:37,746
因为?子是父　神所印证的。” (6:27) because God, the Father,  has put his mark of approval on him.

562
00:50:39,581 --> 00:50:43,377
众?问他说：“我们当行什么，才算做　神的工呢？” (6:28) What can we do in order to do  what God wants us to do?

563
00:50:44,837 --> 00:50:48,841
耶稣回答说：“信　神所差来的，这就是做　神的工。”(6:29) What God wants you to do  is to believe in the one he sent.

564
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:52,845
他们又说：“你行什么神?，叫我们看见就信你？ What miracle will you perform  so that we may see it and believe you?

565
00:50:53,095 --> 00:50:54,930
你到底做什么事呢？ (6:30) What will you do?

566
00:50:56,974 --> 00:51:00,978
我们的祖宗在旷野颈过吗哪，?经上写着说： Our ancestors ate manna in the desert,  just as the scripture says:

567
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,106
‘他从天上赐下粮来给他们颈。’(6:31) "He gave them bread from heaven to eat."

568
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:06,567
耶稣说：“我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

569
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:09,778
那从天上来的粮，不是摩西赐给你们的， What Moses gave you  was not the bread from heaven.

570
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:13,407
乃是我父将天上来的真粮赐给你们。 (6:32) It is my Father who gives you  the real bread from heaven.

571
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:16,785
因为　神的粮，就是那从天上降下来 For the bread that God gives  is he who comes down from heaven...

572
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,662
赐生命给世界的。” (6:33) and gives life to the world.

573
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:22,332
他们说：“主啊，常将这粮赐给我们。”(6:34) Sir, give us this bread.  Give us this bread always.

574
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,585
耶稣说：“我就是生命的粮， I am the bread of life!

575
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:29,464
到我这里来的，必定不饿； Those who come to me  will never be hungry.

576
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:32,718
信我的，永远不渴。(6:35) Those who believe in me  will never be thirsty.

577
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,557
只是我对你们说过，你们已经看见我，还是不信。 (6:36) Now I told you that you have seen me,  but will not believe.

578
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:43,770
凡父所赐给我的?，必到我这里来； Everyone whom my Father gives me  will come to me.

579
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:47,649
到我这里来的，我总不丢?他。 (6:37) I will never turn away  anyone who comes to me...

580
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:51,778
因为我从天上降下来，不是要按自己的意思行， because I have come down from heaven  to do not my own will..

581
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:54,281
乃是要按那差我来者的意思行。 (6:38) but the will of him who sent me.

582
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:58,160
差我来者的意思 And it is the will of him who sent me...

583
00:51:59,066 --> 00:52:01,077
差我来者的意思就是： And it is the will of him who sent me...

584
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:04,789
他所赐给我的，叫我一个也不失落， that I should not lose any  of all those he has given me...

585
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:08,251
在末??叫他复活。(6:39) but that I should raise them all to life  on the last day!

586
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,129
因为我父的意思 For what my Father wants...

587
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:15,591
是叫一?见子而信的?得永生， is that all who see the Son  and believe in him should have eternal life.

588
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:21,097
并?在末?我要叫他复活。” (6:40) And I will raise them to life on the last day.

589
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,308
漠太?因为耶稣说“我是从天上降下来的粮”， The people started grumbling about him,  because he said.:

590
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:27,061
就私下议论他，说： (6:41) "I am the bread  that came down from heaven. "

591
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:28,688
“这不是约瑟的儿子耶稣吗？ This man...

592
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:33,901
“这不是约瑟的儿子耶稣吗？ is Jesus, son of Joseph, isn't he?

593
00:52:36,446 --> 00:52:39,407
他的父母我们?不?得吗？ We know his father and mother!

594
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:44,912
他?今怎么说‘我是从天上降下来的’呢？” (6:42) How, then, does he now say  he came down from heaven?

595
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:03,431
耶稣回答说：“你们不要大家议论。 (6:43) Stop grumbling among yourselves!

596
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:14,317
?不是差我来的父吸引?，就没有能到我这里来的； People cannot come to me unless  the Father who sent me draws them to me!

597
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:20,239
到我这里来的，在末?我要叫他复活。 (6:44) And I will raise them to life on the last day.

598
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,121
在先知书上写着说： The prophets wrote:

599
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,167
‘他们都要蒙　神的教训。 "Everyone will be taught by God."

600
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:39,092
’凡听见父之教训又学习的，就到我这里来。 (6:45). Anyone who hears the Father  and learns from him comes to me.

601
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:45,598
这不是说有?看见过父， This does not mean  that anyone has seen the Father.

602
00:53:46,516 --> 00:53:49,143
惟独从　神来的，他看见过父。 (6:46) He who is from God  is the only one who has seen the Father.

603
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:51,354
我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

604
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:54,023
信的? He who believes...

605
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,651
有永生。 (6:47) has eternal life.

606
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,823
我就是生命的粮。 (6:48) I am the bread of life!

607
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:09,038
你们的祖宗在旷野颈过吗哪，还是死了。 (6:49) Your ancestors ate manna in the desert,  but they died.

608
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:13,459
这是从天上降下来的粮， But the bread that comes down from heaven  is of such a kind...

609
00:54:13,543 --> 00:54:16,003
叫?颈了就不死。(6:50) that whoever eats it will not die.

610
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:20,383
我是从天上降下来生命的粮； I am the living bread  that came down from heaven!

611
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:25,012
??颈这粮，就必永远活着。 If you eat this bread, you will live forever!

612
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:29,976
我所要赐的粮，就是我的?， The bread that I will give you is my flesh...

613
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:33,354
为世?之生命所赐的。” (6:51) which I give so that the world may live!

614
00:54:33,396 --> 00:54:35,648
因此，漠太?彼此争论说： This started an angry argument  among them.

615
00:54:35,732 --> 00:54:38,526
“这个?怎能把他的?给我们颈呢？” (6:52) How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

616
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:41,571
耶稣说：“我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

617
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:46,033
你们?不颈?子的?，不喝?子的血， If you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man  and drink his blood...

618
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,745
就没有生命在你们里面。 (6:53) you will not have life in yourselves!

619
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,332
颈我?喝我血的?就有永生， Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood  have eternal life...

620
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:57,170
在末?我要叫他复活。 (6:54) and I will raise them to life on the last day.

621
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:01,048
我的?真是可颈的，我的血真是可喝的。 (6:55) For my flesh is the real food,  my blood is the real drink!

622
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:05,928
颈我?、喝我血的?常在我里面， Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood  live in me...

623
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,431
我也常在他里面。(6:56) and I live in them.

624
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:13,311
永活的父怎样差我来， The living Father sent me...

625
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,023
我又因父活着； and because of him I live also.

626
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:22,570
照样，颈我?的?也要因我活着。 (6:57) In the same way, whoever eats me  will live because of me.

627
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:27,116
这就是从天上降下来的粮。颈这粮的?，就永远活着，不像你们的祖宗颈过吗哪还是死了。”  This, then, is the bread  that came down from heaven.

628
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:33,247
这就是从天上降下来的粮。颈这粮的?，就永远活着，不像你们的祖宗颈过吗哪还是死了。”  It is not like the bread  that your ancestors ate, but then later died.

629
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:36,417
这就是从天上降下来的粮。颈这粮的?，就永远活着，不像你们的祖宗颈过吗哪还是死了。”  Those who eat this bread...

630
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:39,253
这就是从天上降下来的粮。颈这粮的?，就永远活着，不像你们的祖宗颈过吗哪还是死了。” (6:58) will live forever.

631
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:44,509
这些话是耶稣在迦百农会堂里教训?说的。 (6:59) Jesus said this as he taught  in the synagogue in Capernaum.

632
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:48,930
他的门徒中有好些?听见了，  Many of his followers heard this and said:

633
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:53,017
就说：“这话甚难，谁能听呢？”(6:60) "This teaching is too hard.  Who can listen to it?"

634
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:59,065
耶稣心里知道门徒为这话议论，就对他们说： Without being told, Jesus knew  that they were grumbling about this.

635
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:01,609
“这话是叫你们聪?吗（注：“聪?”原文作“跌倒”）？ (6:61) Does this make you want to give up?

636
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:03,861
倘或 Suppose, then...

637
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:08,574
你们看见?子升到他原来所在之处，怎么样呢？ (6:62) that you should see the Son of Man go back  up to the place where he was before?

638
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,285
叫?活着的乃是灵， What gives life is God's Spirit.

639
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,746
?伐是无益的。 Human power is of no use at all.

640
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:18,418
我对你们所说的话就是灵，就是生命。 (6:63) The words I have spoken to you  bring God's life-giving Spirit.

641
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:23,089
只是你们中间 Yet some of you...

642
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,258
有不信的?。 do not believe.

643
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:30,096
”耶稣从?头就知道谁不信他， Jesus knew from the very beginning  who were the ones that would not believe...

644
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:32,390
谁要卖他。 (6:64) and which one would betray him.

645
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,351
耶稣又说：“所以我对你们说过， This is the very reason I told you...

646
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:38,813
?不是蒙我父的恩赐，  that no people can come to me...

647
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,358
没有?能到我这里来。”(6:65) unless the Father makes it possible  for them to do so.

648
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:44,777
从此，他门徒中多有 Because of this, many of Jesus' followers...

649
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:47,530
退?的，不再和他魂行。(6:66) turned back  and would not go with him anymore.

650
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:54,954
耶稣就对那十二个门徒说： And you...

651
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:00,334
“你们也要?吗？” (6:67) would you also like to leave?

652
00:57:00,543 --> 00:57:02,879
西门彼得回答说：“主啊，你有永生之道， Lord, to whom would we go?

653
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:06,340
我们还归从谁呢？ (6:68) You have the words that give eternal life.

654
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:09,302
我们已经信了， And now we believe and know...

655
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,221
又知道你是 that you are the Holy One...

656
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,849
　神的圣者。”(6:69) who has come from God.

657
00:57:23,566 --> 00:57:26,986
耶稣说：“我不是拣选了你们十二个门徒吗？ I chose the 12 of you, didn't I?

658
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:32,575
但你们中间有一个是魔鬼。” (6:70) Yet one of you is a devil.

659
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:36,287
耶稣这话是指着加略?西门的儿子漠大说的； He was talking about Judas,  the son of Simon Iscariot.

660
00:57:36,996 --> 00:57:40,500
他本是十二个门徒里的一个， For Judas, even though he was  one of the 12 disciples...

661
00:57:41,084 --> 00:57:43,044
后来要卖耶稣的。(6:71) was going to betray him.

662
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:49,050
这事以后，耶稣在加利利游行， After this, Jesus traveled in Galilee.

663
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:51,761
不愿在漠太游行， He did not want to travel in Judea...

664
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:55,264
因为漠太?想要杀他。(7:1) because the Jewish authorities there  were wanting to kill him.

665
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:58,559
当时，漠太?的住棚节近了， (7:2) The time for the Festival of Shelters  was near...

666
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:00,728
耶稣的弟兄就对他说： so Jesus' brothers said to him:

667
00:58:00,853 --> 00:58:03,398
“你离开这里上漠太?吧！ "Leave this place and go to Judea...

668
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:06,734
叫你的门徒也看见你所行的事。 (7:3) "so that your followers will see  the things that you are doing. "

669
00:58:07,777 --> 00:58:11,906
?要显扬名声，没有在暗处行事的， People don't hide what they're doing  if they want to be well known.

670
00:58:11,948 --> 00:58:16,202
你?果行这些事，就当将自己显明给世?看。” (7:4) Since you are doing these things,  let the whole world know about you.

671
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:18,788
因为连他的弟兄说这话，是因为不信他。 (7:5) Not even his brothers believed in him.

672
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,582
耶稣就对他们说:“我的时候还没有到， The right time for me has not yet come.

673
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:24,168
你们的时候常是方便的。(7:6) Any time is right for you.

674
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:26,629
世?不能恨你们，?是恨我， The world cannot hate you,  but it hates me...

675
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:29,757
因为我指证他们所做的事是恶的。 (7:7) because I keep telling it  that its ways are bad.

676
00:58:31,259 --> 00:58:33,261
你们上?过节吧！ You go on to the festival

677
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:36,472
我现在不上?过这节， I am not going to this festival...

678
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,059
因为我的时候还没有满。”(7:8) because the right time has not come for me.

679
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:43,396
耶稣说了这话，?旧住在加利利。 (7:9) He said this, and then stayed on in Galilee.

680
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:48,776
但他弟兄上?以后，他也上?过节， After his brothers had gone to the festival,  Jesus also went.

681
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,613
不是明?，似乎是暗?的。 (7:10) However, he did not go openly, but secretly.

682
00:58:54,824 --> 00:58:58,286
正在节?，漠太?寻找耶稣 The Jewish authorities were looking for him  at the Festival.

683
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:00,413
说：“他在哪里？”(7:11) "Where is he?" they asked.

684
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,666
众?为他纷纷议论， There was much whispering about him  in the crowd.

685
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:06,836
有的说：“他是好?。”有的说：“不?， "He is a good man, " some people said.  "No, " others said...

686
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:08,796
他是迷惑众?的。”(7:12) "he fools the people. "

687
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:12,800
只是没有?明明地讲论他， But no one talked about him openly...

688
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:16,179
因为怕漠太?。 (7:13) because they were afraid  of the Jewish authorities.

689
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:20,183
到了节?， The Festival was nearly half over...

690
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:23,269
耶稣上殿里?教训?。 (7:14) when Jesus went to the Temple  and began teaching.

691
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:27,899
漠太?就希?说： The Jewish authorities  were greatly surprised.

692
00:59:29,025 --> 00:59:31,402
“这个?没有学过，怎么明白书呢？” How does this man know so much...

693
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,198
“这个?没有学过，怎么明白书呢？”(7:15) when he has never been to school?

694
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:39,202
耶稣说：“我的教训不是我自己的，乃是那差我来者的。 (7:16) What I teach is not my own teaching,  but it comes from God, who sent me.

695
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:41,329
??立志遵着他的旨意行， Those willing to do  what God wants will know...

696
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:45,500
就必晓得这教训或是出于　神，或是我?着自己说的。(7:17) whether what I teach comes from God,  or whether I speak on my own authority.

697
00:59:46,334 --> 00:59:50,505
??着自己说，是?自己的?耀； Those who speak on their own authority  are trying to gain glory for themselves.

698
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,674
惟有?那差他来者的?耀， But he who wants glory  for the one who sent him is honest...

699
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:56,344
这?是真的，在他心里没有不义。 (7:18) and there is nothing false in him.

700
00:59:57,053 --> 00:59:58,638
摩西?不是传律法给你们吗？ Moses gave you the Law, didn't he?

701
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:02,683
你们?没有一个?守律法。 But not one of you obeys the Law.

702
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:07,271
为什么想要杀我呢？” (7:19) Why are you trying to kill me?

703
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:10,983
众?回答说：“你是被鬼附着了！谁想要杀你？” (7:20) You have a demon in you.  Who is trying to kill you?

704
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:15,029
耶稣说：“我做了一件事，你们都以为希?。(7:21) I performed one miracle,  and you were all surprised.

705
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:18,157
摩西传割礼给你们 Moses ordered you  to circumcise your sons...

706
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:21,744
（?实不是从摩西?的，乃是从祖先?的）， although it was not Moses  but your ancestors who started it.

707
01:00:21,828 --> 01:00:24,664
因此你们也在安息?给?行割礼。 (7:22) And so, you circumcise a boy  on the Sabbath.

708
01:00:24,956 --> 01:00:29,460
??在安息?受割礼，免得违背摩西的律法， If a boy is circumcised on the Sabbath  so that Moses' Law is not broken...

709
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,838
我在安息?叫一个???好了，你们就向我生?吗？ why are you angry with me...

710
01:00:32,088 --> 01:00:35,383
我在安息?叫一个???好了，你们就向我生?吗？　 (7:23) because I made a man completely well  on the Sabbath?

711
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:38,553
不可按外貌断定是悖 Stop judging by external standards...

712
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:41,222
总要按公?断定是恪！(7:24) and judge by true standards.

713
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:44,976
耶路?冷?中有的说：  Some of the people of Jerusalem said:

714
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:48,438
“这不是他们想要杀的?吗？(7:25) "Isn't this the man  the authorities are trying to kill?

715
01:00:48,563 --> 01:00:52,233
你看他还明明地讲道，他们也不向他说什么， "Look, he is talking in public,  and they say nothing against him.

716
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:58,406
难道官长真知道这是基督吗？ (7:26) "Can it be that they really know  that he is the Messiah?

717
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:02,910
?而我们知道这个?从哪里来；只是基督来的时候，没有?知道他从哪里来。”  "But when the Messiah comes,  no one will know where he is from.

718
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:06,080
?而我们知道这个?从哪里来；只是基督来的时候，没有?知道他从哪里来。” (7:27) "And we all know  where this man comes from. "

719
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:13,045
那时，耶稣在殿里教训?，大声说： As Jesus taught in the Temple,  he said in a loud voice:

720
01:01:13,129 --> 01:01:15,131
“你们也知道我， Do you really know me...

721
01:01:15,465 --> 01:01:17,467
也知道我从哪里来； and know where I am from?

722
01:01:19,135 --> 01:01:21,637
我来并不是批于自己， I have not come on my own authority.

723
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:24,515
但那差我来的是真的。 He who sent me, however, is truthful.

724
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,394
你们不?识他， (7:28) 我??识他， You do not know him, but I know him...

725
01:01:28,478 --> 01:01:31,689
因为我是从他来的，他也是差了我来。” (7:29) because I come from him, and he sent me.

726
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:37,695
他们就想要捉拿耶稣， Then they tried to seize him...

727
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:03,596
只是没有?下手，因为他的时候还没有到。(7:30) but no one laid a hand on him,  because his hour had not yet come.

728
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:12,522
但众?中间有好些信他的，说： But many in the crowd believed in him.

729
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:16,984
“基督来的时候，他所行的神??能比这?所行的更多吗？” (7:31) When the Messiah comes, will he perform  more miracles than this man has?

730
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:25,159
法利??听见众?为耶稣这样纷纷议论， The Pharisees heard the crowd  whispering these things about Jesus...

731
01:02:27,412 --> 01:02:31,207
祭司长和法利??就打发差役?捉拿他。 (7:32) so they and the chief priests  sent some guards to arrest him.

732
01:02:37,213 --> 01:02:40,133
于是耶稣说：“我还有不多的时候和你们魂在， I shall be with you a little while longer...

733
01:02:41,843 --> 01:02:44,554
以后就回到差我来的那里?。 (7:33) and then I shall go away  to him who sent me.

734
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,723
你们要找我，?找不着； You will look for me,  but you will not find me...

735
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,435
我所在的地方，你们不能到。” (7:34) because you cannot go where I will be.

736
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:55,022
漠太?就彼此对问说： The Jewish authorities  said among themselves:

737
01:02:55,106 --> 01:02:57,900
“这?要往哪里?，叫我们找不着呢？ "Where is he about to go  so that we shall not find him?"

738
01:02:58,234 --> 01:03:02,864
难道他要往散住希腊中的漠太?那里?教训希腊?吗？ (7:35) Will he go to the Greek cities,  where our people live and teach the Greeks?

739
01:03:03,656 --> 01:03:06,659
他说‘你们要找我， He says that we will look for him...

740
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:09,454
?找不着； but will not find him...

741
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:13,040
我所在的地方，你们不能到’， and that we cannot go where he will be.

742
01:03:15,251 --> 01:03:16,669
这话是什么意思呢？” (7:36) What does he mean?

743
01:03:17,295 --> 01:03:20,423
节?的末?，就是最大之?， On the last and most important day  of the festival...

744
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:22,800
耶稣站着高声说： Jesus stood up and said in a loud voice.:

745
01:03:22,884 --> 01:03:27,597
“??渴了，可以到我这里来喝！ (7:37) 信我的?， Whoever is thirsty should come to me,  and whoever believes in me should drink.

746
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:29,849
就?经上所说： As the scripture says:

747
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:33,770
‘从他腹中要流出活水的江河来。’” (7:38) "Streams of life-giving water  will pour out from his side."

748
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:35,730
耶稣这话 Jesus said this about the Spirit...

749
01:03:35,772 --> 01:03:38,900
是指着信他之?要受圣灵说的。 which those who believed in him  were going to receive.

750
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:42,111
那时还没有赐下圣灵来， At that time,  the Spirit had not yet been given...

751
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:45,198
因为耶稣尚未得着?耀。 (7:39) because Jesus had not been raised to glory.

752
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:48,951
众?听见这话，有的说： Some of the people in the crowd  heard him say this.

753
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:52,205
“这真是那先知。” (7:40) 有的说：“这是基督。” This man is really the Prophet!

754
01:03:53,331 --> 01:03:56,042
但也有的说：“基督?是从加利利出来的吗？(7:41) The Messiah will not come from Galilee!

755
01:03:56,375 --> 01:04:00,755
经上?不是说‘基督是大卫的后裔， The scripture says that the Messiah  will be a descendant of King David...

756
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:04,175
从大卫本乡伯利恒出来的’吗？” (7:42) and will be born in Bethlehem,  the town where David lived.

757
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:10,264
于是众?因着耶稣?了纷争。 (7:43) So there was a division in the crowd  because of Jesus.

758
01:04:10,348 --> 01:04:12,141
?中有?要捉拿他， Some wanted to seize him...

759
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:14,435
只是无?下手。 (7:44) but no one laid a hand on him.

760
01:04:17,438 --> 01:04:18,898
差役回到祭司长和法利??那里， When the guards went back...

761
01:04:18,981 --> 01:04:21,401
他们对差役说：“ the chief priests and Pharisees asked them:

762
01:04:23,111 --> 01:04:24,612
你们为什么没有带他来呢？” (7:45) Why did you not bring him?

763
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:27,448
差役回答说：“从来没有像他这样说话的。” (7:46) Nobody has ever talked the way  this man does.

764
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:29,492
法利??说：“你们也受了迷惑吗？ (7:47) Did he fool you, too?

765
01:04:30,827 --> 01:04:35,456
官长或是法利???有信他的呢？ (7:48) Have you ever known one of the authorities  or one Pharisee to believe in him?

766
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:39,585
但这些不明白律法的百姓 This crowd does not know  the Law of Moses.

767
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:47,385
是被咒诅的。” (7:49) So they are under God's curse.

768
01:04:47,677 --> 01:04:52,682
内中有尼哥德慕，就是从??见耶稣的，对他们说：　(7:50) One of the Pharisees there was Nicodemus,  the man who had gone to see Jesus before.

769
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:57,812
“不先听本?的口供，不知道他所做的事， According to our Law, we cannot  condemn people before hearing them...

770
01:04:58,229 --> 01:05:00,773
难道我们的律法还定他的罪吗？” (7:51) and finding out what they have done.

771
01:05:01,733 --> 01:05:03,776
他们回答说：“你也是出于加利利吗？ Are you also from Galilee?

772
01:05:10,283 --> 01:05:11,784
你??查考， Study the scriptures...

773
01:05:11,868 --> 01:05:15,580
就可知道加利利没有出过先知。” (7:52) and you will learn  that no prophet ever comes from Galilee.

774
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:21,210
于是各?都回家?了， Then everyone went home...

775
01:05:21,627 --> 01:05:23,629
耶稣?往橄榄山?。 (8:1) but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

776
01:05:30,887 --> 01:05:34,057
?早又回到殿里， Early the next morning,  he went back to the Temple.

777
01:05:34,724 --> 01:05:39,228
众百姓都到他那里?，他就坐下教训他们。(8:2) All the people gathered round him,  and he sat down and began to teach them.

778
01:05:40,229 --> 01:05:42,857
文士和法利?? The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees...

779
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:46,027
带着一个行淫时被拿的妇?来， brought in a woman  who had been caught committing adultery...

780
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,237
叫她站在当中。 (8:3) and they made her stand before them all.

781
01:05:48,321 --> 01:05:49,614
就对耶稣说：“夫子， Teacher...

782
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:57,705
这妇?是正行淫之时被拿的。(8:4) this woman was caught in the very act  of committing adultery!

783
01:05:58,915 --> 01:06:00,708
摩西在律法上吩咐我们， In our Law, Moses commanded...

784
01:06:01,793 --> 01:06:06,297
把这样的妇?用石头打死。 that such a woman must be stoned to death.

785
01:06:10,093 --> 01:06:11,886
你说该把她怎么样呢？” (8:5) Now, what do you say?

786
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:16,724
他们说这话，乃试探耶稣，要得着告他的把柄。 They said this to trap Jesus,  so that they could accuse him.

787
01:06:18,726 --> 01:06:22,230
耶稣?弯着腰用指头在地上画字。 (8:6) But he bent over  and wrote on the ground with his finger.

788
01:06:29,821 --> 01:06:32,031
他们还是不住地问他， As they stood there asking him questions...

789
01:06:32,115 --> 01:06:33,825
耶稣就直?腰来， he straightened up.

790
01:06:53,302 --> 01:06:56,180
对他们说：“你们中间谁是没有罪的， Whichever one of you  has committed no sin...

791
01:06:56,723 --> 01:06:59,100
谁就可以先拿石头打她。”(8:7) may throw the first stone at her.

792
01:07:01,936 --> 01:07:04,981
于是又弯着腰用指头在地上画字。 (8:8) Then he bent over again  and wrote on the ground.

793
01:07:10,862 --> 01:07:14,699
他们听见这话， When they heard this,  they all left, one by one...

794
01:07:14,782 --> 01:07:16,576
就从老到少一个一个地都出?了， the older ones first.

795
01:07:40,433 --> 01:07:43,978
只剩下耶稣一?，还有那妇???站在当中。(8:9) Jesus was left alone  with the woman still standing there.

796
01:07:45,313 --> 01:07:47,023
耶稣就直?腰来，对她说：“妇?，那些?在哪里呢？没有?定你的罪吗？” (8:10) He straightened up.

797
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:50,276
“妇?，那些?在哪里呢？ Where are they?

798
01:07:59,035 --> 01:08:01,329
没有?定你的罪吗？” (8:10) Is there no one left to condemn you?

799
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:02,789
她说：“主啊，没有。” No one, sir.

800
01:08:06,542 --> 01:08:08,002
耶稣说： Well, then...

801
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:11,297
“我也不定你的罪， I do not condemn you either.

802
01:08:12,882 --> 01:08:13,883
?吧！ Go...

803
01:08:16,094 --> 01:08:17,887
从此不要再犯罪了。” (8:11) but do not sin again.

804
01:08:34,904 --> 01:08:37,407
耶稣又对众?说： Jesus spoke to the Pharisees again.

805
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:40,243
“我是世界的光。 I am the light of the world.

806
01:08:40,326 --> 01:08:44,330
跟从我的，就不在黑暗里走，必要得着生命的光。”(8:12) Who follows me will have the light of life  and will never walk in darkness.

807
01:08:44,414 --> 01:08:47,208
法利??对他说：“你是为自己作见证， Now you are testifying on your own behalf!

808
01:08:47,417 --> 01:08:49,836
你的见证不真。” (8:13) -What you say proves nothing!  -No.

809
01:08:50,711 --> 01:08:54,674
耶稣说：“我虽?为自己作见证，我的见证还是真的。 Even though I do testify on my own behalf,  what I say is true...

810
01:08:55,091 --> 01:08:58,469
因我知道我从哪里来，往哪里?； because I know where I came from  and where I am going.

811
01:08:59,554 --> 01:09:02,974
你们?不知道我从哪里来，往哪里?。(8:14) You do not know where I came from  or where I'm going.

812
01:09:03,266 --> 01:09:06,060
你们是以外貌（注：原文作“??身”）判断?， You make judgments in a purely human way.

813
01:09:06,686 --> 01:09:08,646
我?不判断?(8:15) I pass judgment on no one.

814
01:09:09,397 --> 01:09:12,734
就是判断?，我的判断也是真的， But if I were to do so,  my judgment would be true...

815
01:09:12,984 --> 01:09:15,278
因为不是我独自在这里， because I am not alone in this.

816
01:09:15,528 --> 01:09:17,947
还有差我来的父与我魂在。 (8:16) The Father who sent me is with me.

817
01:09:22,535 --> 01:09:24,662
你们的律法上也记着说： It is written in your Law...

818
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:27,165
‘两个?的见证 that when two witnesses agree...

819
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,417
是真的。’ (8:17) what they say is true.

820
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,879
我是为自己作见证， I testify on my own behalf...

821
01:09:32,962 --> 01:09:35,840
还有差我来的父也是为我作见证。” (8:18) and the Father who sent me  also testifies on my behalf.

822
01:09:35,923 --> 01:09:37,717
他们就问他说：“你的父在哪里？” Where is your "Father"?

823
01:09:38,885 --> 01:09:41,304
耶稣回答说：“你们不?识我，也不?识我的父； You know neither me nor my Father.

824
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:45,099
?是?识我，也就?识我的父。” (8:19) If you knew me,  you would know my Father also.

825
01:09:45,641 --> 01:09:48,102
这些话是耶稣在殿里的 Jesus said all this  as he taught in the Temple...

826
01:09:48,144 --> 01:09:49,854
库房教训?时所说的， in the room  where the offering boxes were placed.

827
01:09:50,021 --> 01:09:52,565
也没有?拿他， And no one arrested him...

828
01:09:52,565 --> 01:09:54,776
因为他的时候还没有到。 (8:20) because his hour had not come.

829
01:09:55,443 --> 01:09:59,030
耶稣又对他们说：“我要?了，你们要找我， I will go away, and you will look for me...

830
01:09:59,113 --> 01:10:01,324
并?你们要死在罪中； but you will die in your sins.

831
01:10:02,825 --> 01:10:04,786
我所?的地方，你们不能到。” (8:21) You cannot go where I am going.

832
01:10:04,827 --> 01:10:07,747
漠太?说：“他说‘我所?的地方，你们不能到’， He says that we cannot go  where he is going.

833
01:10:09,123 --> 01:10:11,584
难道他要自尽吗？” (8:22) Does this mean that he will kill himself?

834
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:14,003
耶稣对他们说：“你们是从下头来的， You belong to this world here below...

835
01:10:14,087 --> 01:10:15,963
我是从上头来的； but I come from above.

836
01:10:17,006 --> 01:10:20,426
你们是属这世界的，我不是属这世界的。 (8:23) You are from this world,  but I am not from this world.

837
01:10:21,677 --> 01:10:24,806
所以我对你们说，你们要死在罪中； That is why I told you  that you will die in your sins.

838
01:10:25,181 --> 01:10:27,266
你们?不信我是基督， And you will die in your sins...

839
01:10:28,059 --> 01:10:31,062
必要死在罪中。”(8:24) if you do not believe that "I Am Who I Am."

840
01:10:32,021 --> 01:10:34,148
他们就问他说：“你是谁？” Who are you?

841
01:10:36,734 --> 01:10:39,654
耶稣对他们说：“就是我从?初所告诉你们的。 (8:25) What I have told you  from the very beginning.

842
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:42,865
我有许多事讲论你们， I have much to say about you...

843
01:10:42,949 --> 01:10:44,909
判断你们； much to condemn you for.

844
01:10:45,284 --> 01:10:48,204
但那差我来的是真的， The one who sent me, however, is truthful...

845
01:10:48,871 --> 01:10:52,250
我在他那里所听见的，我就传给世?。” (8:26) and I tell the world only  what I have heard from him.

846
01:10:56,379 --> 01:11:00,675
他们不明白耶稣是指着父说的。 (8:27) They did not understand that Jesus  was talking to them about the Father.

847
01:11:00,758 --> 01:11:03,928
所以耶稣说：“你们举??子以后， When you lift up the Son of Man,  you will know...

848
01:11:04,053 --> 01:11:05,847
必知道我是基督， that "I Am Who I Am."

849
01:11:07,181 --> 01:11:10,601
并?知道我没有一件事是?着自己做的。 Then you will know  that I do nothing on my own authority...

850
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:14,313
我说这些话，乃是照着父所教训我的。(8:28) but I say only  what the Father has instructed me to say.

851
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:17,024
那差我来的，是与我魂在； And he who sent me is with me.

852
01:11:17,608 --> 01:11:19,694
他没有?下我独自在这里， He has not left me alone...

853
01:11:20,153 --> 01:11:22,739
因为我常做他所喜悦的事。” (8:29) because I always do what pleases him.

854
01:11:23,448 --> 01:11:27,869
耶稣说这话的时候，就有许多?信他。 (8:30) Many who heard Jesus say these things  believed in him.

855
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:33,708
耶稣对信他的漠太?说：“你们?常常遵守我的道，就真是我的门徒。 (8:31) If you obey my teaching,  you are really my disciples.

856
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:37,003
你们必晓得真理，真理必叫你们得以自批。” (8:32) You will know the truth,  and the truth will set you free.

857
01:11:37,128 --> 01:11:41,716
他们回答说：“我们是亚伯拉罕的后裔，从来没有作过谁的奴?， We are the descendants of Abraham,  and we have never been anybody's slaves.

858
01:11:43,134 --> 01:11:45,553
你怎么说‘你们必得以自批’呢？” (8:33) What do you mean, then,  by saying, "You will be free"?

859
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:47,305
耶稣回答说：“我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

860
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:49,932
所有犯罪的，就是罪的奴?。 (8:34) Everyone who sins is a slave of sin.

861
01:11:50,016 --> 01:11:52,477
奴?不能永远住在家里， A slave does not belong  to a family permanently...

862
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,896
儿子是永远住在家ā！(8:35) but a son belongs there forever.

863
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:58,441
所以天父的儿子?叫你们自批，你们就真自批了。 (8:36) If the Son sets you free,  then you will be really free.

864
01:11:58,608 --> 01:12:00,401
我知道你们是亚伯拉罕的子孙， I know you are Abraham's descendants.

865
01:12:00,443 --> 01:12:04,072
你们?想要杀我，因为你们心里?不下我的道。 (8:37) Yet you are trying to kill me  because you will not accept my teaching.

866
01:12:04,113 --> 01:12:06,783
我所说的，是在我父那里看见的； I talk about what my Father has shown me...

867
01:12:06,866 --> 01:12:09,077
你们所行的，是在你们的父那里听见的。” (8:38) but you do what your father has told you!

868
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,037
他们说：“我们的父就是亚伯拉罕。” Our father is Abraham.

869
01:12:11,287 --> 01:12:16,042
耶稣说：“你们?是亚伯拉罕的儿子，就必行亚伯拉罕所行的事。 (8:39) If you really were Abraham's children,  you would do the same things that he did!

870
01:12:16,626 --> 01:12:20,171
我将在　神那里所听见的真理告诉了你们， All I have ever done  is to tell you the truth I heard from God...

871
01:12:20,254 --> 01:12:22,006
现在你们?想要杀我！ yet you are trying to kill me.

872
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:24,300
这不是亚伯拉罕所行的事， (8:40) Abraham did nothing like this.

873
01:12:24,842 --> 01:12:26,719
你们是行你们父所行的事。” You are doing what your father did.

874
01:12:26,803 --> 01:12:30,306
他们说：“我们不是从淫乱生的，我们只有一位父，就是　神。” God Himself is the only Father we have...

875
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:32,558
他们说：“我们不是从淫乱生的，我们只有一位父，就是　神。” (8:41) and we are his true children.

876
01:12:36,062 --> 01:12:38,439
耶稣说：“倘?　神是你们的父， If God really were your father...

877
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:41,818
你们就必爱我， you would love me  because I came from God...

878
01:12:42,276 --> 01:12:43,736
因为我本是出于神，也是从　神而来， and now I am here.

879
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,239
并不是批着自己来， I did not come on my own authority...

880
01:12:46,364 --> 01:12:47,907
乃是他差我来。 (8:42) but He sent me!

881
01:12:48,616 --> 01:12:51,202
你们为什么不明白我的话呢？ Why do you not understand what I say?

882
01:12:52,829 --> 01:12:56,249
无闶且蚰忝遣荒芴我的道。(8:43) It is because you cannot bear to listen  to my message.

883
01:12:56,874 --> 01:12:59,377
你们是出于你们的父魔鬼， You are the children of your father,  the Devil...

884
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:02,338
你们父的私欲，你们?要行。 and you want to follow  your father's desires!

885
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:05,133
他从?初是杀?的， From the very beginning,  he was a murderer...

886
01:13:05,174 --> 01:13:07,385
不守真理， and has never been on the side of truth...

887
01:13:07,468 --> 01:13:09,846
因他心里没有真理； because there is no truth in him!

888
01:13:10,221 --> 01:13:13,433
他说谎是出于自己， When he tells a lie,  he is only doing what is natural to him...

889
01:13:13,516 --> 01:13:16,644
因他本来是说谎的，也是说谎之?的父。 (8:44) because he is a liar and the father of all lies!

890
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,939
我将真理告诉你们， But I tell the truth...

891
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,067
你们就因此不信我。 (8:45) and that is why you do not believe me.

892
01:13:24,736 --> 01:13:27,989
你们中间谁能指证我有罪呢？ Which one of you can prove  that I am guilty of sin?

893
01:13:28,823 --> 01:13:32,118
我既?将真理告诉你们，为什么不信我呢？(8:46) If I tell the truth,  then why do you not believe me?

894
01:13:32,577 --> 01:13:35,872
出于　神的，必听　神的话； He who comes from God  listens to God's words.

895
01:13:36,748 --> 01:13:39,167
你们不听， You, however, are not from God...

896
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:41,502
因为你们不是出于　神。” (8:47) and that is why you will not listen.

897
01:13:41,586 --> 01:13:44,714
漠太?回答说：“我们说你是?马利亚?， Were we not right in saying  that you are a Samaritan...

898
01:13:44,797 --> 01:13:46,758
并?是鬼附着的，这话?不正对吗？” (8:48) and have a demon in you?

899
01:13:47,717 --> 01:13:49,302
耶稣说：“我不是鬼附着的， I have no demon.

900
01:13:50,178 --> 01:13:52,847
我尊敬我的父，你们倒?慢我。(8:49) I honor my Father, but you dishonor me.

901
01:13:53,222 --> 01:13:55,683
我不?自己的?耀，  I am not seeking honor for myself.

902
01:13:56,017 --> 01:13:59,896
有一位为我??耀、定是愕摹(8:50) But there is one who is seeking it,  and who judges in my favor.

903
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:02,315
我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth!

904
01:14:03,566 --> 01:14:06,736
??遵守我的道，就永远不见死。” (8:51) Whoever obeys my teaching will never die!

905
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:09,280
漠太?对他说：“现在我们知道你是鬼附着的。 Now we know for sure  that you have a demon.

906
01:14:09,363 --> 01:14:11,991
亚伯拉罕死了，众先知也死了， Abraham died, and the prophets died...

907
01:14:12,116 --> 01:14:15,703
你还说‘??遵守我的道，就永远不尝死味’。(8:52) yet you say that whoever obeys  your teaching will never die.

908
01:14:15,912 --> 01:14:17,872
难道你比我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕还大吗？他死了， Our father Abraham died.

909
01:14:17,914 --> 01:14:20,458
难道你比我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕还大吗？他死了， You do not claim  to be greater than Abraham, do you?

910
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:22,627
众先知也死了！ And the prophets also died.

911
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:26,172
你将自己当作什么?呢？” (8:53) Who do you think you are?

912
01:14:26,547 --> 01:14:30,593
耶稣回答说：“我??耀自己，我的?耀就算不得什么； If I were to honor myself,  that honor would be worth nothing.

913
01:14:31,761 --> 01:14:35,973
?耀我的乃是我的父，就是你们所说是你们的　神。 (8:54) The one who honors me is my Father,  the very one you say is your God!

914
01:14:36,516 --> 01:14:38,810
你们未曾?识他，我??识他。 You have never known him, but I know him.

915
01:14:38,893 --> 01:14:40,561
我?说不?识他，我就是说谎的，像你们一样； If I were to say I do not know him...

916
01:14:40,603 --> 01:14:44,607
但我?识他，也遵守他的道。(8:55) I would be a liar like you,  but I do know him, and I obey his Word.

917
01:14:47,193 --> 01:14:50,363
你们的祖宗亚伯拉罕 Your father Abraham rejoiced...

918
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:53,366
欢欢喜喜地仰望我的?子， that he was to see the time of my coming.

919
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:56,202
既看见了，就快乐。” (8:56) He saw it and was glad.

920
01:14:56,452 --> 01:15:00,164
漠太?说：“你还没有五十岁，?见过亚伯拉罕呢？” (8:57) You are not even 50 years old,  and you have seen Abraham?

921
01:15:07,755 --> 01:15:09,799
耶稣说：“我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

922
01:15:15,972 --> 01:15:18,015
还没有亚伯拉罕 Before Abraham was born...

923
01:15:23,771 --> 01:15:24,939
就有了我。” (8:58) "I am."

924
01:15:28,109 --> 01:15:29,068
于是他们拿石头要打他， Stone him!

925
01:15:29,152 --> 01:15:31,738
于是他们拿石头要打他， Then they picked up stones  to throw at him...

926
01:15:59,515 --> 01:16:02,727
耶稣?躲藏，从殿里出?了。 (8:59) but Jesus hid himself and left the Temple.

927
01:16:26,417 --> 01:16:30,963
耶稣过?的时候，看见一个?生来是瞎眼的。(9:1) As Jesus was walking along,  he saw a man who had been born blind.

928
01:16:35,384 --> 01:16:36,719
门徒问耶稣说：“拉比， Teacher...

929
01:16:36,803 --> 01:16:39,430
这?生来是瞎眼的，是谁犯了罪？ whose sin caused him to be born blind?

930
01:16:40,014 --> 01:16:43,434
是这?呢？是他父母呢？” (9:2) Was it his own, or his parents' sin?

931
01:16:45,353 --> 01:16:49,482
耶稣回答说：“也不是这?犯了罪，也不是他父母犯了罪， His blindness has nothing to do  with his sins or his parents' sins.

932
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,153
是要在他身上显出　神的作为来。 (9:3) He is blind so that God's power  might be seen at work in him.

933
01:16:54,237 --> 01:16:56,114
趁着白?， As long as it is day...

934
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:59,659
我们必须做那差我来者的工； we must keep on doing the work  of him who sent me.

935
01:17:00,952 --> 01:17:02,620
黑夜将到， Night is coming...

936
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,873
就没有?能做工了。 (9:4) when no one can work.

937
01:17:09,877 --> 01:17:11,879
我在世上的时候， While I am in the world...

938
01:17:14,715 --> 01:17:17,301
是世上的光。” (9:5) I am the light for the world.

939
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:39,741
耶稣说了这话，就吐唾沫在地上， After he said this,  Jesus spat on the ground...

940
01:17:39,824 --> 01:17:42,034
用唾沫和泥 and made some mud with the spittle.

941
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:48,750
抹在瞎子的眼睛上，(9:6) He rubbed the mud on the man's eyes.

942
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:02,305
对他说：“你往西罗亚池子里?洗。” Go and wash your face  in the pool of Siloam.

943
01:18:02,513 --> 01:18:06,517
（“西罗亚”翻出来，就是“ 奉差?”） This name means "Sent. "

944
01:19:09,747 --> 01:19:12,250
他?一洗， So the man went, washed his face...

945
01:19:12,542 --> 01:19:15,044
回头就看见了。(9:7) and came back seeing.

946
01:19:16,254 --> 01:19:20,675
他的邻舍和那素常见他是讨饭的，就说： His neighbors, then, and the people who  had seen him begging before this asked:

947
01:19:20,758 --> 01:19:23,010
“这不是那从?坐着讨饭的?吗？” (9:8) "Isn't this the man  who used to sit and beg?"

948
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,764
有?说：“是他。”又有?说：“不是，?是像他。” -He is the one.  -No, he isn't. He just looks like him.

949
01:19:27,014 --> 01:19:28,516
他自己说：“是我。” (9:9) I am the man.

950
01:19:28,933 --> 01:19:30,685
他们对他说：“你的眼睛是怎么开的呢？” (9:10) How is it that you can now see?

951
01:19:30,852 --> 01:19:34,188
他回答说：“有一个?名叫耶稣，他和泥抹我的眼睛， The man called Jesus made some mud,  rubbed it on my eyes...

952
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:37,066
对我说‘你往西罗亚池子?洗’； and told me to go to Siloam  and wash my face.

953
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:39,736
我?一洗， So I went, and as soon as I washed...

954
01:19:40,486 --> 01:19:41,821
就看见了。” (9:11) I could see.

955
01:19:42,113 --> 01:19:44,198
他们说：“那个?在哪里？”他说：“我不知道。” (9:12) -Where is he?  -I don't know.

956
01:19:47,285 --> 01:19:50,663
他们把从?瞎眼的?带到法利??那里。 (9:13) Then they took to the Pharisees  the man who had been blind.

957
01:19:51,122 --> 01:19:55,793
耶稣和泥开他眼睛的?子是安息?。 (9:14) The day that Jesus made the mud and  cured him of his blindness was a Sabbath.

958
01:20:11,017 --> 01:20:14,979
法利??也问他是怎么得看见的。 The Pharisees then asked the man again  how he had received his sight.

959
01:20:15,229 --> 01:20:17,440
瞎子对他们说：“他把泥抹在我的眼睛上， He put some mud on my eyes...

960
01:20:17,565 --> 01:20:20,693
我?一洗，就看见了。” (9:15) I washed my face, and now I can see.

961
01:20:21,069 --> 01:20:25,823
法利??中有的说：“这个?不是从　神来的，因为他不守安息?。” The man who did this cannot be from God,  for he does not obey the Sabbath law.

962
01:20:26,282 --> 01:20:30,203
又有?说：“一个罪?怎能行这样的神?呢？” How could a man who is a sinner  perform such miracles as these?

963
01:20:31,204 --> 01:20:33,623
他们就?了纷争。 (9:16) And there was division among them.

964
01:20:34,165 --> 01:20:36,876
他们又对瞎子说：“他既?开了你的眼睛， You say he cured you of your blindness.

965
01:20:38,252 --> 01:20:39,712
你说他是怎样的?呢？” What do you say about him?

966
01:20:39,796 --> 01:20:41,380
他说：“是个先知。” (9:17) He is a prophet!

967
01:20:41,923 --> 01:20:44,801
漠太?不信他从?是瞎眼，后来能看见的， The Jewish authorities, however,  were not willing to believe...

968
01:20:44,884 --> 01:20:49,222
等到叫了他的父母来， (9:18) that he had been blind and could now see  until they called his parents.

969
01:20:51,766 --> 01:20:53,393
问他们说：“这是你们的儿子吗？ Is this your son?

970
01:20:55,103 --> 01:20:57,146
你们说他生来是瞎眼的， You say that he was born blind.

971
01:20:57,230 --> 01:20:59,273
?今怎么能看见了呢？” (9:19) How is it, then, that he can now see?

972
01:20:59,357 --> 01:21:03,277
他父母回答说：“他是我们的儿子，生来就瞎眼，这是我们知道的。 (9:20) We know that he is our son,  and we know that he was born blind.

973
01:21:04,112 --> 01:21:07,073
至于他?今怎么能看见，我们?不知道； But we don't know how it is  that he is now able to see...

974
01:21:07,156 --> 01:21:10,159
是谁开了他的眼睛，我们也不知道。 nor do we know who cured him  of his blindness.

975
01:21:10,701 --> 01:21:11,953
他已经成了?，你们问他吧！他自己必能说。” Ask him.

976
01:21:12,703 --> 01:21:15,248
他已经成了?，你们问他吧！他自己必能说。” (9:21) He is old enough,  and he can answer for himself.

977
01:21:15,331 --> 01:21:19,001
他父母说这话，是怕漠太?， His parents said this because  they were afraid of the Jewish authorities...

978
01:21:19,085 --> 01:21:21,712
因为漠太?已经商议定了，?有 who had already agreed  that anyone who said he believed...

979
01:21:21,796 --> 01:21:25,758
?耶稣是基督的，要把他赶出会堂。 (9:22) that Jesus was the Messiah  would be expelled from the synagogue.

980
01:21:26,509 --> 01:21:30,471
因此他父母说：“他已经成了?，你们问他吧！” (9:23) That is why his parents said,  "He is old enough. Ask him. "

981
01:21:31,514 --> 01:21:35,476
所以法利??第二次叫了那从?瞎眼的?来， A second time, they called back  the man who had been born blind.

982
01:21:35,977 --> 01:21:38,938
对他说：“你该将?耀归给　神， Promise before God  that you will tell the truth.

983
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:45,737
我们知道这?是个罪?。” (9:24) We know that this man who cured you  is a sinner.

984
01:21:47,238 --> 01:21:49,949
他说：“他是个罪?不是，我不知道； I do not know if he is a sinner or not.

985
01:21:50,867 --> 01:21:52,618
有一件事我知道： One thing I do know.

986
01:21:53,286 --> 01:21:54,787
从?我是眼瞎的， I was blind...

987
01:21:57,582 --> 01:21:59,083
?今能看见了！” (9:25) and now I see.

988
01:22:03,796 --> 01:22:05,423
他们就问他说：“他向你做什么？ What did he do to you?

989
01:22:05,506 --> 01:22:07,759
是怎么开了你的眼睛呢？” (9:26) How did he cure you of your blindness?

990
01:22:07,842 --> 01:22:10,762
他回答说：“我方才告诉你们，你们不听， I have already told you,  and you would not listen.

991
01:22:10,845 --> 01:22:15,183
为什么又要听呢？莫隳忝且惨作他的门徒吗？” (9:27) Why do you want to hear it again? Maybe  you, too, would like to be his disciples?

992
01:22:15,808 --> 01:22:17,560
他们就骂他说： They insulted him and said:

993
01:22:18,019 --> 01:22:22,356
“你是他的门徒，我们是摩西的门徒！(9:28) You are that fellow's disciple,  but we are Moses' disciples!

994
01:22:22,857 --> 01:22:25,526
神对摩西说话，是我们知道的； We know that God spoke to Moses!

995
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:30,531
只是这个?，我们不知道他从哪里来。” (9:29) As for that fellow, however,  we do not even know where he comes from.

996
01:22:30,573 --> 01:22:32,241
那?回答说：“他开了我的眼睛，你们竟不知道他从哪里来，这真是?怪！ What a strange thing that is.

997
01:22:32,325 --> 01:22:35,661
那?回答说：“他开了我的眼睛，你们竟不知道他从哪里来，这真是?怪！(9:30) You do not know where he comes from,  but he cured me of my blindness.

998
01:22:35,745 --> 01:22:38,081
我们知道　神不听罪?， We know  that God does not listen to sinners.

999
01:22:38,289 --> 01:22:41,918
惟有敬奉　神、遵行他旨意的，　神才听他。(9:31) He does listen to people who respect him  and do what he wants them to do.

1000
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:43,503
从创世以来， Since the beginning of the world...

1001
01:22:43,586 --> 01:22:46,672
未曾听见有?把生来是瞎子的眼睛开了。 (9:32) nobody has heard of anyone  giving sight to a person born blind.

1002
01:22:46,756 --> 01:22:50,843
这??不是从　神来的，什么也不能做。” (9:33) Unless this man came from God,  he would not be able to do a thing!

1003
01:22:51,969 --> 01:22:56,432
他们回答说：“你??生在罪孽中， You were born and brought up in sin...

1004
01:22:58,142 --> 01:23:00,436
还要教训我们吗？” and you are trying to teach us?

1005
01:23:04,816 --> 01:23:08,152
于是把他赶出?了。(9:34) And they expelled him from the synagogue.

1006
01:23:24,752 --> 01:23:27,422
耶稣听说他们把他赶出?，后来遇见他，就说： When Jesus heard what had happened,  he found the man.

1007
01:23:27,505 --> 01:23:29,924
“你信　神的儿子吗？” (9:35) Do you believe in the Son of Man?

1008
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:34,429
他回答说：“主啊，谁是　神的儿子，叫我信他呢？”(9:36) Tell me who he is, sir,  so that I can believe in him.

1009
01:23:35,263 --> 01:23:37,306
耶稣说：“你已经看见他， You have already seen him...

1010
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:40,393
现在和你说话的就是他。” (9:37) and he is the one  who is talking with you now.

1011
01:23:44,355 --> 01:23:45,898
他说：“主啊，我信！” I believe, Lord.

1012
01:23:46,983 --> 01:23:49,235
就拜耶稣。 (9:38) And he knelt down before Jesus.

1013
01:23:49,277 --> 01:23:51,612
耶稣说：“我为诀判到这世上来， I came to this world to judge...

1014
01:23:52,822 --> 01:23:55,116
叫不能看见的，可以看见； so that the blind should see...

1015
01:23:55,408 --> 01:23:58,035
能看见的，反瞎了眼。” (9:39) and those who see should become blind.

1016
01:23:58,745 --> 01:24:02,832
魂他在那里的法利??听见这话，就说： Some Pharisees who were there with him  heard him say this and asked him.:

1017
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,461
“难道我们也瞎了眼吗？” (9:40) Surely you don't mean  that we are blind, too?

1018
01:24:11,466 --> 01:24:14,635
耶稣对他们说：“你们?瞎了眼，就没有罪了； If you were blind,  then you would not be guilty.

1019
01:24:15,845 --> 01:24:18,473
但?今你们说：‘我们能看见，’ But since you claim that you can see...

1020
01:24:18,556 --> 01:24:21,142
所以你们的罪还在。 (9:41) this means that you are still guilty.

1021
01:24:24,812 --> 01:24:26,898
我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth!

1022
01:24:27,857 --> 01:24:30,568
?进羊?，不从门进?， The man who does not enter the sheep pen  by the gate...

1023
01:24:30,651 --> 01:24:34,030
倒从别处爬进?，那?就是贼，就是?盗。 (10:1) but climbs in some other way  is a thief and a robber!

1024
01:24:34,155 --> 01:24:38,242
从门进?的，才是羊的灵?。 (10:2) The man who goes in through the gate  is the shepherd of the sheep.

1025
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,454
看门的就给他开门， The gatekeeper opens the gate for him.

1026
01:24:41,496 --> 01:24:44,624
羊也听他的声音。他按著名叫自己的羊， The sheep hear his voice  as he calls his own sheep by name...

1027
01:24:44,749 --> 01:24:47,418
把羊领出来。(10:3) 既放出自己的羊来， and he leads them out.  When he has brought them out...

1028
01:24:47,502 --> 01:24:51,130
就在?头走，羊也跟着他，因为?得他的声音。 (10:4) he goes ahead of them, and the sheep  follow him because they know his voice.

1029
01:24:51,881 --> 01:24:54,342
羊不跟着生?， They will not follow someone else.

1030
01:24:54,425 --> 01:24:57,303
因为不?得他的声音， Instead they will run away  from such a person...

1031
01:24:57,345 --> 01:24:59,222
必要逃跑。” (10:5) because they do not know his voice.

1032
01:24:59,305 --> 01:25:03,684
耶稣将这比喻告诉他们，但他们不明白所说的是什么意思。 (10:6) Jesus told them this parable,  but they did not understand what he meant.

1033
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:05,728
所以耶稣又对他们说： So Jesus said again.:

1034
01:25:05,812 --> 01:25:09,315
“我实实在在地告诉你们：我就是羊的门。 (10:7) I am telling you the truth.  I am the gate for the sheep.

1035
01:25:09,941 --> 01:25:12,527
凡在我以先来的，都是贼，是?盗， All others who came before me  are thieves and robbers...

1036
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:14,362
羊?不听他们。 (10:8) but the sheep did not listen to them.

1037
01:25:14,404 --> 01:25:15,905
我就是门，凡从我进来的， I am the gate.

1038
01:25:16,656 --> 01:25:19,283
必?得救， Those who come in by me will be saved.

1039
01:25:19,492 --> 01:25:22,036
并?出?得草颈。 (10:9) They will come in and go out  and find pasture.

1040
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:25,748
盗贼来，无阋偷?、杀害、毁坏； The thief comes only in order  to steal, kill, and destroy.

1041
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:30,169
我来了，是要叫羊（注：或作“?”）得生命， I have come in order  that you might have life.

1042
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:33,172
并?得的更丰盛。(10:10) Life in all its fullness.

1043
01:25:34,757 --> 01:25:38,511
我是好灵?，好灵?为羊舍命。 (10:11) I am the good shepherd,  who is willing to die for the sheep.

1044
01:25:39,721 --> 01:25:44,058
?是雇工，不是灵?，羊也不是他自己的， When the hired man, who is not a shepherd  and does not own the sheep...

1045
01:25:44,392 --> 01:25:46,185
他看见狼来， sees a wolf coming...

1046
01:25:46,811 --> 01:25:48,896
就?下羊逃走； he leaves the sheep and runs away.

1047
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:52,150
狼抓住羊，赶散了羊?。 (10:12) So the wolf snatches the sheep  and scatters them.

1048
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:56,446
雇工逃走，因他是雇工， The hired man runs away  because he is only a hired man...

1049
01:25:56,654 --> 01:25:59,073
并不顾念羊。 (10:13) and does not care about the sheep.

1050
01:25:59,866 --> 01:26:01,284
我是好灵?，我?识我的羊，我的羊也?识我。 (10:14) I am the good shepherd.

1051
01:26:01,367 --> 01:26:04,412
正?父?识我，我也?识父一样， As the Father knows me,  and I know the Father...

1052
01:26:05,413 --> 01:26:09,250
正?父?识我，我也?识父一样， in the same way I know my sheep,  and they know me.

1053
01:26:11,711 --> 01:26:14,088
并?我为羊舍命。(10:15) And I am willing to die for them.

1054
01:26:16,424 --> 01:26:19,010
我另外有羊， There are other sheep which belong to me...

1055
01:26:19,093 --> 01:26:21,095
不是这?里的； that are not in this sheep pen.

1056
01:26:21,179 --> 01:26:23,097
我必须领他们来， I must bring them, too.

1057
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:25,767
他们也要听我的声音， They will listen to my voice...

1058
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:29,020
并?要合成一?，归一个灵?了。 (10:16). and they will become one flock  with one shepherd.

1059
01:26:29,645 --> 01:26:31,397
我父爱我， The Father loves me...

1060
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:35,818
因我将命舍?，好再?回来。 (10:17) because I am willing to give up my life  in order that I may receive it back again.

1061
01:26:35,902 --> 01:26:38,321
没有?夺我的命?， No one takes my life away from me.

1062
01:26:38,696 --> 01:26:41,115
是我自己舍的。 I give it up of my own free will.

1063
01:26:41,449 --> 01:26:43,409
我有?柄舍了， I have the right to give it up...

1064
01:26:43,451 --> 01:26:46,079
也有?柄?回来， and I have the right to take it back.

1065
01:26:46,245 --> 01:26:49,624
这是我从我父所受的命令。” (10:18) This is what my Father  has commanded me to do.

1066
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:53,920
漠太?为这些话又?了纷争。 (10:19) Again there was division among the people  because of these words.

1067
01:26:54,045 --> 01:26:57,048
内中有好些?说：“他是被鬼附着，而?疯了， -He has a demon!  -He is crazy!

1068
01:26:57,131 --> 01:27:01,302
为什么听他呢？” (10:20) 又有?说：“这不是鬼附之?所说的话， -Why do you listen to him?  -A man with a demon cannot talk like this!

1069
01:27:01,344 --> 01:27:04,305
鬼?能叫瞎子的眼睛开了呢？”(10:21) How could a demon give sight  to blind people?

1070
01:27:12,647 --> 01:27:13,731
在耶路?冷有囊殿节，是冬天的时候。 It was winter...

1071
01:27:13,815 --> 01:27:18,653
在耶路?冷有囊殿节，是冬天的时候。 (10:22) and the Festival of the Dedication of the  Temple was being celebrated in Jerusalem.

1072
01:27:23,533 --> 01:27:26,577
耶稣在殿里所罗门的廊下行走。 (10:23) Jesus was walking in Solomon's Porch  in the Temple...

1073
01:27:26,911 --> 01:27:28,955
漠太?围着他说： when the people gathered round him.

1074
01:27:28,955 --> 01:27:31,541
“你叫我们漠疑不定到几时呢？ How long are you going  to keep us in suspense?

1075
01:27:31,624 --> 01:27:34,627
你?是基督，就明明地告诉我们。” (10:24) Tell us the plain truth. Are you the Messiah?

1076
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:38,131
耶稣回答说：“我已经告诉你们，你们不信。 I have already told you,  but you would not believe me.

1077
01:27:38,256 --> 01:27:41,884
我奉我父之名所行的事可以为我作见证； (10:25) The deeds I do by my Father's authority  speak on my behalf.

1078
01:27:45,555 --> 01:27:47,640
只是你们不信， But you will not believe...

1079
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:49,684
因为你们不是我的羊。 (10:26) for you are not my sheep.

1080
01:27:53,855 --> 01:27:55,982
我的羊听我的声音， My sheep listen to my voice.

1081
01:27:56,858 --> 01:27:58,526
我也?识他们，他们也跟着我； (10:27) I know them, and they follow me.

1082
01:27:58,651 --> 01:28:01,654
我又赐给他们永生，他们永不灭亡， I give them eternal life,  and they shall never die.

1083
01:28:01,738 --> 01:28:04,282
谁也不能从我手里把他们夺?。(10:28) No one can snatch them away from me.

1084
01:28:04,532 --> 01:28:07,702
我父把羊赐给我，他比万有都大， What my Father has given me  is greater than everything...

1085
01:28:07,827 --> 01:28:11,289
谁也不能从我父手里把他们夺?。 (10:29) and no one can snatch them away  from the Father's care.

1086
01:28:11,622 --> 01:28:13,374
我与父原为一。” (10:30) The Father and I are one.

1087
01:28:13,458 --> 01:28:15,126
漠太?又拿?石头来要打他。  Blasphemy! Stone him!

1088
01:28:15,209 --> 01:28:18,671
漠太?又拿?石头来要打他。 (10:31) Then the people again picked up stones  to throw at him.

1089
01:28:36,564 --> 01:28:38,983
耶稣对他们说：“我从父 I have done many good deeds  in your presence...

1090
01:28:39,067 --> 01:28:41,360
显出许多善事给你们看， which the Father gave me to do.

1091
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:44,405
你们是为哪一件拿石头打我呢？” (10:32) For which one of these  do you want to stone me?

1092
01:28:44,489 --> 01:28:47,408
漠太?回答说：“我们不是为善事拿石头打你， We do not want to stone you  because of any good deeds...

1093
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:49,327
是为你说僭妄的话； but because of your blasphemy!

1094
01:28:49,452 --> 01:28:52,747
又为你是个?，反将自己当作　神。” (10:33) You are only a man,  but you are trying to make yourself God!

1095
01:29:02,131 --> 01:29:04,467
耶稣说：“你们的律法上?不是写着 It is written in your own Law...

1096
01:29:04,759 --> 01:29:07,011
‘我曾说你们是神’吗？ (10:34) that God said, "You are gods."

1097
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:10,556
经上的话是不能废的。 We know that what the scripture says  is true forever...

1098
01:29:10,681 --> 01:29:13,184
?那些承受　神道的?， and God called those people gods...

1099
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:16,604
尚?称为神；(10:35) the people to whom his message was given.

1100
01:29:17,021 --> 01:29:21,067
父所分别为圣，又差到世间来的， As for me, the Father chose me  and sent me into the world.

1101
01:29:21,442 --> 01:29:24,278
他自称是　神的儿子，你们还向他说‘你说僭妄的话’吗？  How, then, can you say that I blaspheme...

1102
01:29:24,445 --> 01:29:27,198
他自称是　神的儿子，你们还向他说‘你说僭妄的话’吗？ (10:36) because I said that I am the Son of God?

1103
01:29:28,074 --> 01:29:32,370
我?不行我父的事，你们就不必信我； (10:37) Do not believe me, then, if I am not doing  the things my Father wants me to do.

1104
01:29:32,495 --> 01:29:36,082
我?行了，你们纵?不信我， But if I do them,  even though you do not believe me...

1105
01:29:37,208 --> 01:29:39,919
也当信这些事， you should at least believe my deeds...

1106
01:29:40,336 --> 01:29:43,756
叫你们又知道又明白： in order that you may know,  once and for all...

1107
01:29:45,591 --> 01:29:47,677
父在我里面， that the Father is in me...

1108
01:29:48,052 --> 01:29:49,721
我也在父里面。” (10:38) and that I am in the Father.

1109
01:29:49,804 --> 01:29:50,847
他们又要拿他，他?逃出他们的手走了。  Blasphemy!

1110
01:30:04,986 --> 01:30:09,490
他们又要拿他，他?逃出他们的手走了。 (10:39) Once more, they tried to seize Jesus,  but he slipped out of their hands.

1111
01:30:12,493 --> 01:30:15,204
耶稣又往约旦河外?， Jesus then went back again  across the Jordan River...

1112
01:30:15,288 --> 01:30:18,166
到了约翰?初施洗的地方， to the place  where John had been baptizing...

1113
01:30:18,291 --> 01:30:20,042
就住在那里。(10:40) and he stayed there.

1114
01:30:24,505 --> 01:30:26,507
有许多?来到他那里， Many people came to him.

1115
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:29,886
他们说：“约翰一件神?没有行过， "John performed no miracls, " they said...

1116
01:30:30,386 --> 01:30:33,514
但约翰指着这?所说的一?话都是真的。” (10:41) "but everything he said  about this man was true. "

1117
01:30:33,681 --> 01:30:36,642
在那里信耶稣的?就多了。 (10:42) And many people there believed in him.

1118
01:30:44,942 --> 01:30:48,905
有一个患病的?，名叫拉?路，住在伯大尼， A man named Lazarus,  who lived in Bethany, became sick.

1119
01:30:50,364 --> 01:30:53,868
就是马利亚和她姐姐马大的村庄。(11:1) Bethany was the town  where Mary and her sister Martha lived.

1120
01:30:56,662 --> 01:30:59,999
这马利亚就是那用香膏抹主， This Mary was the one  who poured the perfume on the Lord's feet...

1121
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:02,251
又用头发擦他脚的， and wiped them with her hair.

1122
01:31:06,381 --> 01:31:09,217
患病的拉?路是她的兄弟。 (11:2) It was her brother, Lazarus, who was sick.

1123
01:31:13,054 --> 01:31:15,473
她姊妹两个就打发??见耶稣说： The sisters sent Jesus a message.:

1124
01:31:17,683 --> 01:31:20,436
“主啊，你所爱的?病了。” (11:3) "Lord, your dear friend is sick. "

1125
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,190
耶稣听见就说： When Jesus heard it, he said.:

1126
01:31:24,232 --> 01:31:28,069
“这病不至于死， "The final result of this sickness  will not be the death of Lazarus.

1127
01:31:28,361 --> 01:31:31,489
乃是为　神的?耀， "This has happened in order  to bring glory to God...

1128
01:31:31,697 --> 01:31:35,618
叫　神的儿子因此得?耀。” (11:4) "and it will be the means  by which the Son of God will receive glory. "

1129
01:31:39,414 --> 01:31:42,750
耶稣素来爱马大和她妹子并拉?路，(11:5) Jesus loved Martha, and her sister,  and Lazarus.

1130
01:31:43,376 --> 01:31:45,878
听见拉?路病了， Yet when he received the news  that Lazarus was sick...

1131
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,923
就在所居之地?住了两天。 (11:6) he stayed where he was for two more days.

1132
01:31:49,882 --> 01:31:53,261
?后对门徒说：“我们再往漠太?吧！” (11:7) Then he said to his disciples,  "Let us go back to Judea. "

1133
01:31:53,928 --> 01:31:57,765
门徒说：“拉比，漠太?近来要拿石头打你， Teacher, just a short time ago,  the people there wanted to stone you...

1134
01:31:57,890 --> 01:31:59,767
你还往那里?吗？” (11:8) and are you planning to go back?

1135
01:31:59,934 --> 01:32:02,311
耶稣回答说：“白?不是有十二小时吗？ A day has 1 2 hours, doesn't it?

1136
01:32:02,395 --> 01:32:05,273
?在白?走路，就不至跌倒， So those who walk in broad daylight  do not stumble...

1137
01:32:05,356 --> 01:32:07,400
因为看见这世上的光；(11:9) for they see the light of this world.

1138
01:32:07,483 --> 01:32:09,694
?在黑夜走路，就必跌倒， But if they walk  during the night, they stumble...

1139
01:32:09,777 --> 01:32:11,738
因为他没有光。” (11:10) because they have no light.

1140
01:32:11,946 --> 01:32:14,741
耶稣说了这话，随后对他们说：“我们的朋友拉?路睡了， Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep...

1141
01:32:15,575 --> 01:32:17,785
我?叫醒他！” (11:11) but I will go and wake him up.

1142
01:32:25,501 --> 01:32:28,212
门徒说：“主啊，他?睡了，就必好了。” (11:12) If he is asleep, Lord, he will get well.

1143
01:32:28,713 --> 01:32:31,257
耶稣这话是指着他死说的， Jesus meant that Lazarus had died...

1144
01:32:31,466 --> 01:32:33,551
他们?以为是说照常睡了。 (11:13) but they thought he meant natural sleep.

1145
01:32:33,634 --> 01:32:35,678
耶稣就明明地告诉他们说： So Jesus told them plainly.:

1146
01:32:36,304 --> 01:32:37,972
“拉?路死了。 (11:14) Lazarus is dead.

1147
01:32:41,309 --> 01:32:43,102
我没有在那里就欢喜，这是为你们的缘故， But for your sake...

1148
01:32:43,519 --> 01:32:46,064
我没有在那里就欢喜，这是为你们的缘故， I am glad that I was not with him...

1149
01:32:46,564 --> 01:32:48,566
好叫你们相信。 so that you will believe.

1150
01:32:51,444 --> 01:32:52,612
?今我们可以往他那里?吧！” (11:15) Let us go to him.

1151
01:32:52,653 --> 01:32:55,948
多马，又称为低土马，就对那魂作门徒的说： Thomas, called the Twin,  said to his fellow disciples.:

1152
01:32:55,990 --> 01:33:00,078
“我们也?和他魂死吧。” (11:16) Let us all go along with the Teacher,  so that we may die with him!

1153
01:33:02,705 --> 01:33:07,210
耶稣到了，就知道拉?路在坟墓里已经四天了。　 (11:17) When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus  had been buried four days before.

1154
01:33:09,003 --> 01:33:12,006
伯大尼离耶路?冷不远，约有六里路。 (11:18) Bethany was less than two miles  from Jerusalem...

1155
01:33:12,131 --> 01:33:15,343
有好些漠太?来看马大和马利亚， and many Judeans had come  to see Martha and Mary...

1156
01:33:15,385 --> 01:33:17,428
要为她们的兄弟安慰她们。 (11:19) to comfort them about their brother's death.

1157
01:33:17,512 --> 01:33:21,307
马大听见耶稣来了，就出?迎接他； When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,  she went out to meet him...

1158
01:33:21,349 --> 01:33:23,393
马利亚???坐在家里。 (11:20) but Mary stayed in the house.

1159
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:29,899
马大对耶稣说：“主啊，你?早在这里， If you had been here, Lord...

1160
01:33:30,358 --> 01:33:32,235
我兄弟必不死！ (11:21) my brother would not have died.

1161
01:33:32,527 --> 01:33:34,862
  就是现在，我也知道， But I know that even now...

1162
01:33:35,613 --> 01:33:38,533
你无论向　神?什么，　神也必赐给你。”  (11:22) God will give you whatever you ask him for.

1163
01:33:39,283 --> 01:33:41,577
耶稣说：“你兄弟必?复活。” (11:23) Your brother will rise to life.

1164
01:33:41,702 --> 01:33:44,872
马大说：“我知道在末?复活的时候，他必复活；” (11:24) I know that he will rise to life  on the last day.

1165
01:33:47,542 --> 01:33:50,002
耶稣对她说：“复活在我，生命也在我！ I am the resurrection and the life.

1166
01:33:50,712 --> 01:33:52,880
信我的?，虽?死了， Those who believe in me will live...

1167
01:33:52,964 --> 01:33:54,882
也必复活。(11:25) even though they die.

1168
01:33:55,675 --> 01:33:58,261
凡活着信我的? And those who live and believe in me...

1169
01:33:58,511 --> 01:34:00,012
必永远不死。 will never die.

1170
01:34:03,891 --> 01:34:05,643
你信这话吗？” (11:26) Do you believe this?

1171
01:34:10,273 --> 01:34:11,607
马大说：“主啊，是的， Yes, Lord.

1172
01:34:12,525 --> 01:34:15,236
我信你是基督， I do believe that you are the Messiah...

1173
01:34:15,653 --> 01:34:18,698
是　神的儿子，就是那要临到世界的。” (11:27) the Son of God,  who is to come into the world.

1174
01:34:20,533 --> 01:34:22,034
马大说了这话， After Martha said this...

1175
01:34:22,118 --> 01:34:25,079
就回?暗暗地叫她妹子马利亚说： she went back  and called her sister Mary privately.

1176
01:34:31,252 --> 01:34:33,129
“夫子来了， The Teacher is here...

1177
01:34:33,963 --> 01:34:35,757
叫你。” (11:28) and is asking for you.

1178
01:34:35,798 --> 01:34:39,260
马利亚听见了，就急忙?来，到耶稣那里?。 (11:29) When Mary heard this,  she got up and hurried out to meet him.

1179
01:34:41,179 --> 01:34:43,431
那时，耶稣还没有进村子， Jesus had not yet arrived in the village...

1180
01:34:43,473 --> 01:34:46,517
?在马大迎接他的地方。 (11:30) but was still in the place  where Martha had met him.

1181
01:34:46,809 --> 01:34:49,771
那些魂马利亚在家里安慰她的漠太?， The people who were in the house  with Mary, comforting her...

1182
01:34:49,812 --> 01:34:52,607
见她急忙?来出?，就跟着她， followed her  when they saw her get up and hurry out.

1183
01:34:52,648 --> 01:34:56,027
以为她要往坟墓那里?哭。 (11:31) They thought that she was going  to the grave to weep there.

1184
01:35:04,952 --> 01:35:09,582
  马利亚到了耶稣那里，看见他，就俯伏在他脚?，说： Mary arrived where Jesus was, and  as soon as she saw him, she fell at his feet.

1185
01:35:21,302 --> 01:35:22,512
“主啊， Lord...

1186
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,477
你?早在这里， if you had been here...

1187
01:35:29,644 --> 01:35:31,979
我兄弟必不死。”  (11:32) my brother would not have died.

1188
01:35:32,855 --> 01:35:34,690
耶稣看见她哭， Jesus saw her weeping...

1189
01:35:34,816 --> 01:35:38,277
并看见与她魂来的漠太?也哭， and he saw how the people with her  were weeping also.

1190
01:35:43,366 --> 01:35:46,828
就心里悲叹，又甚忧愁， (11:33) His heart was touched,  and he was deeply moved.

1191
01:36:04,387 --> 01:36:06,431
便说：“你们把他安放在哪里？” Where have you buried him?

1192
01:36:08,015 --> 01:36:09,726
他们回答说：“?主来看。” (11:34) Come and see, Lord.

1193
01:36:16,691 --> 01:36:18,025
耶稣哭了。(11:35) Jesus wept.

1194
01:36:18,443 --> 01:36:21,028
漠太?就说：“你看他爱这?是何等恳?。” (11:36) "See how much he loved him, "  the people said.

1195
01:36:21,821 --> 01:36:23,531
?中有?说： But some of them said:

1196
01:36:23,823 --> 01:36:26,367
“他既?开了瞎子的眼睛， "He gave sight to the blind man, didn't he?

1197
01:36:27,326 --> 01:36:30,204
?不能叫这?不死吗？” (11:37) "Could he not have kept Lazarus  from dying?"

1198
01:36:31,205 --> 01:36:33,875
耶稣又心里悲叹，来到坟墓?； Deeply moved once more,  Jesus went to the tomb...

1199
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:37,795
那坟墓是个洞，有一块石头挡着。 (11:38) which was a cave  with a stone placed at the entrance.

1200
01:36:40,673 --> 01:36:42,425
耶稣说：“你们把石头挪开！” Take the stone away.

1201
01:36:43,801 --> 01:36:47,638
那死?的姐姐马大对他说：“主啊，他现在必是臭了，因为他死了已经四天了。” (11:39) There will be a bad smell, Lord.  He has been buried four days.

1202
01:36:48,139 --> 01:36:52,518
耶稣说：“我不是对你说过，你?信，就必看见　神的?耀吗？” (11:40) Didn't I tell you that you would see  God's glory if you believed?

1203
01:37:07,742 --> 01:37:09,702
他们就把石头挪开。 They took the stone away.

1204
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:25,468
耶稣举目望天说： Jesus looked up.

1205
01:37:25,635 --> 01:37:28,554
“父啊，我感谢你，因为你已经听我； (11:41) I thank you, Father, that you listen to me.

1206
01:37:29,097 --> 01:37:31,724
我也知道你常听我。 I know that you always listen to me...

1207
01:37:32,433 --> 01:37:35,603
但我说这话，是为周围站着的众?， but I say this for the sake  of the people here...

1208
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:39,190
叫他们信是你差了我来。” (11:42) so that they will believe that you sent me.

1209
01:37:49,784 --> 01:37:53,746
说了这话，就大声呼叫说： After he had said this,  he called out in a loud voice:

1210
01:37:57,291 --> 01:37:58,626
“拉?路 Lazarus...

1211
01:38:00,586 --> 01:38:01,838
出来！” (11:43) come out!

1212
01:38:19,397 --> 01:38:20,898
那死?就出来了， He came out...

1213
01:38:23,943 --> 01:38:26,946
手脚裹着布， his hands and feet  wrapped in grave clothes...

1214
01:38:29,615 --> 01:38:31,951
脸上包着手巾。 and with a cloth round his face.

1215
01:38:47,133 --> 01:38:49,802
耶稣对他们说：“解开，叫他走！” (11:44) Untie him, and let him go.

1216
01:38:50,344 --> 01:38:54,974
那些来看马利亚的漠太?，见了耶稣所做的事， Many of the people who had come  to visit Mary saw what Jesus did...

1217
01:38:55,725 --> 01:38:57,727
就多有信他的。 (11:45) and they believed in him.

1218
01:39:00,563 --> 01:39:04,859
  但?中也有?见法利??的，将耶稣所做的事告诉他们。  (11:46) But some of them returned to the Pharisees  and told them what Jesus had done.

1219
01:39:05,568 --> 01:39:09,197
祭司长和法利??聚集公会，说： So the Pharisees and the chief priests  met with the Council and said.:

1220
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,490
“这?行好些神?，我们怎么办呢？ "What shall we do?"

1221
01:39:10,865 --> 01:39:13,201
“这?行好些神?，我们怎么办呢？ (11:47) Look at all the miracles  this man is performing!

1222
01:39:13,367 --> 01:39:17,246
?这样批着他，??都要信他， If we let him go on in this way,  everyone will believe in him...

1223
01:39:17,789 --> 01:39:21,793
罗马?也要来夺我们的地土和我们的百姓。” (11:48) and the Roman authorities will take action  and destroy our temple and our nation!

1224
01:39:26,923 --> 01:39:31,260
内中有一个?，名叫该亚法，本年作大祭司， One of them, named Caiaphas,  who was High Priest that year, said.:

1225
01:39:31,552 --> 01:39:33,513
对他们说：“你们不知道什么。  What fools you are!

1226
01:39:34,555 --> 01:39:36,349
对他们说：“你们不知道什么。 (11:49) Don't you realize...

1227
01:39:36,599 --> 01:39:41,562
  独不想一个?替百姓死，免得通国灭亡， that it is better for you  to have let one man die for the people...

1228
01:39:42,271 --> 01:39:45,233
就是你们的益处。”  (11:50) instead of having  the whole nation destroyed?

1229
01:39:49,612 --> 01:39:52,073
他这话不是出于自己， Actually, he did not say this  of his own accord.

1230
01:39:52,115 --> 01:39:54,784
是因他本年作大祭司， Rather, as he was High Priest that year...

1231
01:39:54,867 --> 01:39:58,663
所以预言耶稣将要替这一国死。 (11:51) he was prophesying that Jesus  was going to die for the Jewish people...

1232
01:39:58,746 --> 01:40:03,292
也不但替这一国死， and not only for them,  but also to bring together into one body...

1233
01:40:03,418 --> 01:40:05,920
并要将　神四散的子民都聚集归一。 (11:52) all the scattered people of God.

1234
01:40:08,589 --> 01:40:13,428
从那??他们就商议要杀耶稣。 (11:53). From that day on, the Jewish authorities  made plans to kill Jesus.

1235
01:40:14,929 --> 01:40:19,892
所以耶稣不再显?行在漠太?中间，就离开那里往靠近旷野的地方?。 So Jesus did not travel openly in Judea, but  left, and went to a place near the desert...

1236
01:40:19,934 --> 01:40:24,397
到了一座城，名叫以法莲，就在那里和门徒魂住。 (11:54) to a town named Ephraim,  where he stayed with his disciples.

1237
01:40:25,398 --> 01:40:27,900
漠太?的逾越节近了， The time for the Passover Festival  was near...

1238
01:40:28,067 --> 01:40:30,820
有许多?从乡下上耶路?冷?， and many people went up from the country  to Jerusalem...

1239
01:40:30,903 --> 01:40:35,074
要在节?洁净自己。 (11:55) to perform the ritual of purification  before the festival.

1240
01:40:36,784 --> 01:40:38,411
  他们就寻找耶稣， They were looking for Jesus...

1241
01:40:38,453 --> 01:40:41,205
站在殿里彼此说： and as they gathered in the Temple,  they asked one another.:

1242
01:40:41,289 --> 01:40:45,209
“你们的意思?何？他不来过节吗？”  (11:56) "What do you think? Surely, he will not  come to the Festival, will he?"

1243
01:40:46,586 --> 01:40:49,338
那时，祭司长和法利??早已吩咐说： The chief priests and the Pharisees  had given orders...

1244
01:40:49,422 --> 01:40:52,633
“?有?知道耶稣在哪里，就要报明， that if anyone knew where Jesus was,  he must report it...

1245
01:40:52,717 --> 01:40:54,635
好?拿他。” (11:57) so that they could arrest him.

1246
01:41:04,633 --> 01:41:06,761
逾越节?六?， Six days before the Passover...

1247
01:41:06,927 --> 01:41:09,847
耶稣来到伯大尼， Jesus went to Bethany,  the home of Lazarus...

1248
01:41:10,139 --> 01:41:12,224
就是他叫拉?路从死里复活之处。 (12:1) the man he had raised from death.

1249
01:41:22,068 --> 01:41:25,988
有?在那里给耶稣预备筵席，马大伺候， They prepared a dinner for him there,  which Martha helped serve.

1250
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:33,245
拉?路也在那魂耶稣坐席的?中。 (12:2) Lazarus was one of those  who were sitting at the table with Jesus.

1251
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:45,049
马利亚就拿着一斤极贵的 Then Mary took a whole pint  of a very expensive perfume...

1252
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:47,051
真哪哒香膏 made of pure nard...

1253
01:41:50,638 --> 01:41:52,723
抹耶稣的脚， poured it on Jesus' feet...

1254
01:41:55,101 --> 01:41:57,269
又用自己头发?擦， and wiped them with her hair.

1255
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:02,900
屋里就满了膏的香?。 (12:3) The sweet smell of the perfume  filled the whole house.

1256
01:42:07,279 --> 01:42:10,116
有一个门徒， One of Jesus' disciples, Judas Iscariot...

1257
01:42:10,616 --> 01:42:13,411
就是那将要卖耶稣的加略?漠大， (12:4) the one who was going to betray him, said.:

1258
01:42:13,536 --> 01:42:15,830
说：“这香膏为什么不卖 Why wasn't this perfume sold...

1259
01:42:18,332 --> 01:42:20,709
?十两银子 for 300 silver coins...

1260
01:42:23,671 --> 01:42:24,880
k济??呢？” and the money...

1261
01:42:25,339 --> 01:42:27,007
k济??呢？” (12:5) given to the poor?

1262
01:42:27,258 --> 01:42:30,052
他说这话，并不是挂念??， He said this not because  he cared about the poor...

1263
01:42:30,136 --> 01:42:31,887
乃因他是个贼， but because he was a thief.

1264
01:42:32,388 --> 01:42:35,725
又带着?囊，常??中所存的。 (12:6) He carried the money bag  and would help himself from it.

1265
01:42:36,392 --> 01:42:37,977
耶稣说：“批她吧！ Leave her alone.

1266
01:42:38,436 --> 01:42:41,689
她是为我安葬之?存留的。 (12:7) Let her keep what she has  for the day of my burial.

1267
01:42:44,358 --> 01:42:47,319
因为常有??和你们魂在， You will always have poor people with you...

1268
01:42:47,695 --> 01:42:50,030
只是你们不常有我。” (12:8) but you will not always have me.

1269
01:43:04,003 --> 01:43:07,423
有许多漠太?知道耶稣在那里， A large number of people  heard that Jesus was in Bethany...

1270
01:43:07,506 --> 01:43:11,886
就来了，不但是为耶稣的缘故，也是要看 so they went there, not only  because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus...

1271
01:43:11,927 --> 01:43:14,346
他从死里所复活的拉?路。 (12:9) whom Jesus had raised from death.

1272
01:43:14,972 --> 01:43:18,642
但祭司长商议连拉?路也要杀了， (12:10) So the chief priests made plans  to kill Lazarus, too...

1273
01:43:19,226 --> 01:43:24,148
因有好些漠太?为拉?路的缘故，回?信了耶稣。(12:11) because, on his account, many Jews  were rejecting them and believing in Jesus.

1274
01:43:27,735 --> 01:43:30,863
第二天，有许多上来过节的?， The next day, the large crowd  that had come to the Passover Festival...

1275
01:43:30,905 --> 01:43:33,741
听见耶稣将到耶路?冷，  (12:12) heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.

1276
01:43:34,617 --> 01:43:38,829
就拿着棕树枝，出?迎接他，喊着说： So they took branches of palm trees  and went out to meet him, shouting.:

1277
01:43:38,913 --> 01:43:43,042
“和散那！奉主名来的 "Praise God! God bless him  who comes in the name of the Lord!

1278
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:45,920
以色列王是应当称颂的！” (12:13) "God bless the King of Israel!"

1279
01:43:47,671 --> 01:43:51,842
耶稣得了一个驴驹，就?上，?经上所记的说： (12:14) Jesus found a donkey and rode on it,  just as the scripture says.:

1280
01:43:52,093 --> 01:43:54,428
“锡安的民哪（注：“民”原文作“女子”），不要惧怕！ "Do not be afraid, city of Zion!

1281
01:43:55,262 --> 01:43:58,933
你的王?着驴驹来了。” (12:15) "Here comes your King,  riding on a young donkey. "

1282
01:44:12,988 --> 01:44:15,950
这些事门徒?先不明白， His disciples did not understand this  at the time...

1283
01:44:15,991 --> 01:44:18,411
等到耶稣得了?耀以后， but when Jesus had been raised to glory...

1284
01:44:18,452 --> 01:44:21,455
才想?这话是指着他写的， they remembered  that the scripture said this about him...

1285
01:44:21,622 --> 01:44:24,166
并?众?果?向他这样行了。 (12:16) and that they had done this for him.

1286
01:44:32,466 --> 01:44:34,218
当耶稣呼唤拉?路， The people who had been with Jesus...

1287
01:44:34,301 --> 01:44:37,930
叫他从死复活出坟墓的时候， when he called Lazarus out of the grave  and raised him from death...

1288
01:44:38,055 --> 01:44:40,141
魂耶稣在那里的众?就作见证。 (12:17) had reported what had happened.

1289
01:44:40,307 --> 01:44:42,435
众?因听见耶稣行了这神?，就?迎接他。 That was why the crowd met him...

1290
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:45,646
众?因听见耶稣行了这神?，就?迎接他。 (12:18) because they heard  he had performed this miracle.

1291
01:44:47,982 --> 01:44:50,693
法利??彼此说： The Pharisees then said to one another.:

1292
01:44:50,985 --> 01:44:54,155
“看哪，你们是徒劳无益， You see, we are not succeeding at all!

1293
01:44:54,447 --> 01:44:57,616
世?都随从他?了。” (12:19) Look, the whole world is following him!

1294
01:45:06,751 --> 01:45:08,919
那时，上来过节礼拜的?中， Some Greeks were among those...

1295
01:45:09,003 --> 01:45:12,214
有几个希腊?。  (12:20) who had gone to Jerusalem  to worship during the festival.

1296
01:45:12,798 --> 01:45:13,966
  他们来见加利利伯?大的 They went to Philip...

1297
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:16,719
腓力，?他说： he was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said.:

1298
01:45:16,844 --> 01:45:19,680
“先生，我们愿意见耶稣。” (12:21) "Sir, we want to see Jesus. "

1299
01:45:22,433 --> 01:45:24,643
腓力?告诉安得烈， Philip went and told Andrew...

1300
01:45:26,270 --> 01:45:28,981
安得烈魂腓力?告诉耶稣。 (12:22) and the two of them went and told Jesus.

1301
01:45:41,535 --> 01:45:45,498
耶稣说：“?子得?耀的时候到了。  (12:23) The hour has now come for the Son of Man  to receive great glory.

1302
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:49,168
我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

1303
01:45:49,377 --> 01:45:52,505
一粒麦子不落在地里死了， A grain of wheat remains  no more than a single grain...

1304
01:45:53,005 --> 01:45:56,008
?旧是一粒； unless it is dropped into the ground  and dies.

1305
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:07,686
?是死了， If it does die...

1306
01:46:08,687 --> 01:46:10,856
就结出许多子粒来。 (12:24) then it produces many grains.

1307
01:46:13,651 --> 01:46:16,487
爱惜自己生命的，就失丧生命； Those who love their own life will lose it.

1308
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:22,326
在这世上恨恶自己生命的，就要保守生命到永生。 (12:25) Those who hate their own life in this world  will keep it for life eternal.

1309
01:46:28,332 --> 01:46:31,168
?有?服事我，就当跟从我； Whoever wants to serve me  must follow me...

1310
01:46:31,627 --> 01:46:33,921
我在哪里，服事我的?也要在那里； so that my servant  will be with me where I am.

1311
01:46:34,088 --> 01:46:37,174
?有?服事我，我父必尊重他。 (12:26) And my Father will honor anyone  who serves me.

1312
01:46:57,111 --> 01:47:00,030
我现在心里忧愁，我说什么才好呢？ Now my heart is troubled. What shall I say?

1313
01:47:01,866 --> 01:47:06,036
父啊， Shall I say, "Father, do not let this hour  come upon me"?

1314
01:47:09,957 --> 01:47:11,959
救我脱离这时候， But that is why I came...

1315
01:47:13,586 --> 01:47:16,756
但我原是为这时候来的。  (12:27) so that I might go through  this hour of suffering.

1316
01:47:20,009 --> 01:47:21,260
父啊， Father...

1317
01:47:22,136 --> 01:47:24,096
愿你?耀你的名。” bring glory to Your name.

1318
01:47:27,808 --> 01:47:29,810
当时就有声音从天上来说： Then a voice spoke from heaven.:

1319
01:47:29,977 --> 01:47:34,106
“我已经?耀了我的名，还要再?耀。” (12:28) "I have brought glory to it,  and I will do so again. "

1320
01:47:35,983 --> 01:47:40,613
站在旁边的众?听见，就说：“打雷了。” The crowd standing there heard the voice,  and some of them said it was thunder...

1321
01:47:40,988 --> 01:47:44,575
还有?说：“有天使对他说话。” (12:29) while others said, "An angel spoke to him. "

1322
01:47:45,826 --> 01:47:49,580
  耶稣说：“这声音不是为我，是为你们来的。  (12:30) It was not for my sake that this voice spoke,  but for yours.

1323
01:47:50,081 --> 01:47:52,792
  现在这世界受诀判， Now is the time for this world to be judged.

1324
01:47:52,917 --> 01:47:55,961
这世界的王要被赶出?。  (12:31) Now the ruler of this world  will be overthrown.

1325
01:47:56,337 --> 01:47:58,464
我?从地上被举?来， When I am lifted up from the earth...

1326
01:47:58,589 --> 01:48:00,674
就要吸引万?来归我。” (12:32) I will draw everyone to me.

1327
01:48:00,925 --> 01:48:05,012
耶稣这话原是指着自己将要怎样死说的。 (12:33) In saying this, he indicated  the kind of death he was going to suffer.

1328
01:48:05,262 --> 01:48:08,307
众?回答说：“我们听见律法上有话说‘基督是永存的’， Our Law tells us  that the Messiah will live forever.

1329
01:48:08,391 --> 01:48:11,227
你怎么说‘?子必须被举?来’呢？ How then can you say  that the Son of Man must be lifted up?

1330
01:48:11,352 --> 01:48:13,229
这?子是谁呢？” (12:34) Who is this Son of Man?

1331
01:48:27,201 --> 01:48:30,162
耶稣对他们说：“光在你们中间还有不多的时候， The light will be among you a little longer.

1332
01:48:33,958 --> 01:48:36,460
应当趁着有光行走， Continue on your way  while you have the light...

1333
01:48:36,544 --> 01:48:39,422
免得黑暗临到你们； so that the darkness  will not come upon you!

1334
01:48:39,714 --> 01:48:43,217
那在黑暗里行走的，不知道往何处?。 (12:35) For the one who walks in the dark  does not know where he is going.

1335
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:46,220
你们应当趁着有光，信从这光， Believe in the light, then, while you have it...

1336
01:48:46,262 --> 01:48:49,223
使你们成为光明之子。” so that you will be the people of the light!

1337
01:48:54,061 --> 01:48:57,815
耶稣说了这话，就离开他们，隐藏了。 (12:36) After Jesus said this,  he went off and hid himself from them.

1338
01:49:01,736 --> 01:49:05,781
他虽?在他们面?行了许多神?， Even though he had performed  all these miracles in their presence...

1339
01:49:05,906 --> 01:49:07,908
他们还是不信他。 (12:37) they did not believe in him...

1340
01:49:08,075 --> 01:49:11,662
这是要应验先知以?亚的话，说： so that what the prophet Isaiah had said  might come true:

1341
01:49:12,371 --> 01:49:15,916
“主啊，我们所传的有谁信呢？ "Lord, who believed the message we told?

1342
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:18,961
主的膀臂向谁显露呢？” (12:38) "To whom did the Lord reveal his power?"

1343
01:49:20,588 --> 01:49:24,258
  他们所以不能信，因为以?亚又说：  (12:39) And so, they were not able to believe,  because Isaiah also said.:

1344
01:49:24,341 --> 01:49:27,720
“主叫他们瞎了眼、硬了心， "God has blinded their eyes  and closed their minds...

1345
01:49:27,845 --> 01:49:31,348
免得他们眼睛看见，心里明白， "so that their eyes would not see,  and their minds would not understand...

1346
01:49:31,432 --> 01:49:34,018
回转过来，我就医治他们。” "and they would not turn to me, " says God...

1347
01:49:34,101 --> 01:49:35,853
回转过来，我就医治他们。” (12:40) "for me to heal them. "

1348
01:49:39,982 --> 01:49:44,695
以?亚因为看见他的?耀，就指着他说这话。(12:41) Isaiah said this because  he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.

1349
01:49:49,283 --> 01:49:53,120
虽??此，官长中?有好些信他的， Even then, many of the Jewish authorities  believed in Jesus...

1350
01:49:53,454 --> 01:49:57,041
只因法利??的缘故，就不承?， but because of the Pharisees,  they did not talk about it openly...

1351
01:49:57,249 --> 01:49:59,794
恐怕被赶出会堂。 (12:42) so as not to be expelled  from the synagogue.

1352
01:50:00,628 --> 01:50:04,590
这是因他们爱?的?耀过于爱　神的?耀。(12:43) They loved human approval  rather than the approval of God.

1353
01:50:04,965 --> 01:50:06,967
耶稣大声说： Jesus said in a loud voice:

1354
01:50:08,135 --> 01:50:10,971
“信我的，不是信我， Whoever believes in me  believes not only in me...

1355
01:50:11,097 --> 01:50:13,224
乃是信那差我来的。 (12:44) but also in him who sent me.

1356
01:50:13,516 --> 01:50:17,478
?看见我，就是看见那差我来的。 (12:45) Whoever sees me  sees also him who sent me.

1357
01:50:18,771 --> 01:50:21,565
我到世上来，乃是光， I have come into the world as light...

1358
01:50:21,982 --> 01:50:25,653
叫凡信我的，不住在黑暗里。 (12:46) so that everyone who believes in me  should not remain in the darkness.

1359
01:50:25,986 --> 01:50:28,906
?有?听见我的话不遵守， If people hear my message  and do not obey it...

1360
01:50:29,281 --> 01:50:31,158
我不诀判他。 I will not judge them.

1361
01:50:31,534 --> 01:50:34,620
我来本不是要诀判世界，乃是要拯救世界。　(12:47) I came not to judge the world,  but to save it.

1362
01:50:35,329 --> 01:50:38,624
?绝我、不领受我话的?， Those who reject me  and do not accept my message...

1363
01:50:38,791 --> 01:50:40,960
有诀判他的， have one who will judge them.

1364
01:50:41,419 --> 01:50:45,631
就是我所讲的道，在末?要诀判他。 (12:48) The words I have spoken  will be their judge on the last day.

1365
01:50:45,635 --> 01:50:48,350
就是我所讲的道，在末?要诀判他。 (12:48) The words I have spoken  will be their judge on the last day.

1366
01:50:49,476 --> 01:50:53,272
因为我没有?着自己讲， This is true because I have not spoken  on my own authority.

1367
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:55,858
惟有差我来的父， But the Father who sent me...

1368
01:50:55,941 --> 01:50:58,777
已经给我命令，叫我说什么，讲什么。 (12:49) has commanded me  what I must say and speak.

1369
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:02,448
我也知道他的命令就是永生。 And I know that his command  brings eternal life.

1370
01:51:03,282 --> 01:51:07,411
故此，我所讲的话正是照着父对我所说的。” (12:50) What I say, then,  is what the Father has told me to say.

1371
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:30,225
逾越节以?， It was now the day  before the Passover Festival.

1372
01:51:31,059 --> 01:51:35,230
耶稣知道自己离世 Jesus knew that the hour had come  for him to leave this world...

1373
01:51:35,856 --> 01:51:37,900
归父的时候到了， and go to the Father.

1374
01:51:38,442 --> 01:51:41,695
他既?爱世间属自己的?， He had always loved those in the world  who were his own...

1375
01:51:42,154 --> 01:51:44,698
就爱他们到底。 (13:1) and he loved them to the very end.

1376
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:55,918
颈晚饭的时候， Jesus and his disciples were at supper.

1377
01:51:58,212 --> 01:52:02,466
魔鬼已将卖耶稣的意思 The Devil had already put into the heart  of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot...

1378
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,427
放在西门的儿子加略?漠大心里。(13:2) the thought of betraying Jesus.

1379
01:52:07,554 --> 01:52:11,100
耶稣知道父已将万有交在他手里， Jesus knew that  the Father had given him complete power.

1380
01:52:11,934 --> 01:52:16,063
?知道自己是从　神出来的，又要归到　神那里?，(13:3) He knew that he had come from God  and was going to God.

1381
01:52:33,497 --> 01:52:37,042
就离席站?来脱了衣服， So he rose from the table,  took off his outer garment...

1382
01:52:37,126 --> 01:52:39,086
拿一条手巾束腰， (13:4) and tied a towel round his waist.

1383
01:52:55,602 --> 01:52:57,938
随后把水倒在盆里， Then he poured some water  into a washbasin...

1384
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:01,483
就洗门徒的脚， and began to wash the disciples' feet...

1385
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:04,570
并用自己所束的手巾擦干。 (13:5) and dry them  with the towel round his waist.

1386
01:53:19,084 --> 01:53:20,544
挨到西门彼得， He came to Simon Peter.

1387
01:53:21,545 --> 01:53:24,047
彼得对他说：“主啊，你洗我的脚吗？” (13:6) Are you going to wash my feet, Lord?

1388
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:29,762
耶稣回答说：“我所做的，你?今不知道， You do not understand now  what I am doing...

1389
01:53:29,845 --> 01:53:32,014
后来必明白。 ”(13:7) but you will understand later.

1390
01:53:32,681 --> 01:53:35,601
彼得说：“你永不可洗我的脚！” Never, at any time, will you wash my feet.

1391
01:53:37,227 --> 01:53:39,396
耶稣说：“我?不洗你， If I do not wash your feet...

1392
01:53:40,022 --> 01:53:42,441
你就与我无分了。” (13:8) you will no longer be my disciple.

1393
01:53:45,652 --> 01:53:46,862
西门彼得说：“主啊， Lord...

1394
01:53:49,156 --> 01:53:52,117
不但我的脚， do not wash only my feet, then.

1395
01:53:53,577 --> 01:53:56,205
连手和头也要洗！。” (13:9) Wash my hands and head, too.

1396
01:54:00,417 --> 01:54:03,170
耶稣说：“凡洗过澡的?， Those who have taken a bath  are completely clean...

1397
01:54:03,253 --> 01:54:05,756
只要把脚一洗， and do not need to wash themselves...

1398
01:54:06,173 --> 01:54:08,050
?身就干净了； except for their feet.

1399
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:12,387
你们是干净的， All of you are clean.

1400
01:54:18,227 --> 01:54:19,728
?而不都是干净的。” (13:10) All, except one.

1401
01:54:19,812 --> 01:54:22,564
耶稣原知道要卖他的是谁，  Jesus already knew  who was going to betray him.

1402
01:54:23,774 --> 01:54:28,237
所以说：“你们不都是干净的。”(13:11) That is why he said,  "All of you, except one, are clean. "

1403
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:44,086
  耶稣洗完了他们的脚， After Jesus had washed their feet...

1404
01:54:44,753 --> 01:54:49,049
就穿上衣服，又坐下，对他们说： he put his outer garment back on  and returned to his place at the table.

1405
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:52,261
“我向你们所做的，你们明白吗？  (13:12) Do you understand  what I have just done to you?

1406
01:54:53,053 --> 01:54:55,347
你们称呼我夫子，称呼我主， You call me Teacher and Lord...

1407
01:54:56,181 --> 01:55:00,144
你们说的不错，我本来是。 (13:13) and it is right that you should do so,  because that is what I am.

1408
01:55:00,519 --> 01:55:03,897
我是你们的主，你们的夫子，尚?洗你们的脚， I, your Lord and Teacher,  have just washed your feet.

1409
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:07,276
你们也当彼此洗脚。(13:14) You, then, should wash one another's feet.

1410
01:55:10,529 --> 01:55:12,865
我给你们作了榜样， I have set an example for you...

1411
01:55:13,407 --> 01:55:16,618
叫你们照着我向你们所做的?做。 (13:15) so that you will do  just what I have done for you.

1412
01:55:17,619 --> 01:55:19,705
我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

1413
01:55:20,205 --> 01:55:22,374
??不能大于主?， No slaves are greater than their master...

1414
01:55:22,458 --> 01:55:25,335
差?也不能大于差他的?。 (13:16) and no messengers are greater  than the one who sent them.

1415
01:55:25,419 --> 01:55:27,546
你们既知道这事， Now that you know this truth...

1416
01:55:27,671 --> 01:55:30,799
?是?行就有福了。 (13:17) how happy you will be  if you put it into practice.

1417
01:55:36,889 --> 01:55:39,349
我这话不是指着你们众?说的， I am not talking about all of you.

1418
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:43,645
我知道我所拣选的是谁。 I know those I have chosen.

1419
01:55:44,563 --> 01:55:46,482
现在要应验经上的话，说： But the scripture must come true that says:

1420
01:55:46,523 --> 01:55:48,984
‘魂我颈饭的?，用脚踢我。’(13:18) "The man who shared my food  turned against me."

1421
01:55:50,986 --> 01:55:53,697
?今事?还没有成就，我要先告诉你们， I tell you this now before it happens...

1422
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:58,118
叫你们到事?成就的时候，可以信我是基督。  (13:19) so that when it does happen,  you will believe that "I Am Who I Am."

1423
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:00,746
我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

1424
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:03,999
有?接待我所差?的，就是接待我； Whoever receives anyone I send  receives me also...

1425
01:56:04,208 --> 01:56:08,128
接待我，就是接待那差?我的。” (13:20) and whoever receives me  receives him who sent me.

1426
01:56:30,651 --> 01:56:32,402
耶稣说了这话， After Jesus had said this...

1427
01:56:32,945 --> 01:56:36,615
心里忧愁，就明说： he was deeply troubled  and declared openly:

1428
01:56:38,951 --> 01:56:41,036
“我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

1429
01:56:45,124 --> 01:56:47,543
你们中间有一个?要卖我了。” (13:21) One of you is going to betray me.

1430
01:56:56,552 --> 01:57:01,056
门徒彼此对看，猜不透所说的是谁。 (13:22) The disciples looked at one another,  completely puzzled about whom he meant.

1431
01:57:03,267 --> 01:57:05,853
有一个门徒，是耶稣所爱的， One of the disciples,  the one whom Jesus loved...

1432
01:57:06,061 --> 01:57:07,479
侧身挨近耶稣的怀里。(13:22) was sitting next to Jesus.

1433
01:57:08,605 --> 01:57:10,232
西门彼得点头对他说： Simon Peter motioned to him.

1434
01:57:12,151 --> 01:57:14,570
“你告诉我们，主是指着谁说的。” (13:24) Ask him whom he is talking about.

1435
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:18,365
那门徒便就势靠着耶稣的胸膛， So that disciple  moved closer to Jesus' side.

1436
01:57:19,241 --> 01:57:20,826
问他说：“主啊，是谁呢？” (13:25) Who is it, Lord?

1437
01:57:25,706 --> 01:57:29,126
耶稣回答说：“我蘸一点饼给谁， I will dip some bread in the sauce  and give it to him.

1438
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:32,254
就是谁。” He is the man.

1439
01:57:36,258 --> 01:57:38,927
耶稣就蘸了一点饼， So he took a piece of bread, dipped it...

1440
01:57:39,136 --> 01:57:42,723
递给加略?西门的儿子漠大。 (13:26) and gave it to Judas,  the son of Simon Iscariot.

1441
01:57:45,642 --> 01:57:49,813
他颈了以后，?但就?了他的心。 As soon as Judas took the bread,  Satan entered into him.

1442
01:57:52,316 --> 01:57:55,986
耶稣便对他说：“你所做的，快做吧！” (13:27) Hurry, and do what you must.

1443
01:57:58,113 --> 01:58:02,117
魂席的?，没有一个知道是为什么对他说这话。 (13:28) None of the others at the table understood  why Jesus said this to him.

1444
01:58:04,119 --> 01:58:06,538
有?因漠大带着?囊， Since Judas was  in charge of the money bag...

1445
01:58:07,206 --> 01:58:10,042
以为耶稣是对他说： some of the disciples thought  that Jesus had told him...

1446
01:58:10,125 --> 01:58:12,669
“你?买我们过节所应用的东西”， to go and buy  what they needed for the festival...

1447
01:58:13,045 --> 01:58:15,172
或是叫他拿什么k济??。 (13:29) or to give something to the poor.

1448
01:58:18,842 --> 01:58:21,470
漠大受了那点饼，立刻就出?。 Judas accepted the bread  and went out at once.

1449
01:58:28,185 --> 01:58:29,478
那时候是夜间了。 (13:30) It was night.

1450
01:58:34,733 --> 01:58:37,486
他既出?，耶稣就说： After Judas had left, Jesus said.:

1451
01:58:38,445 --> 01:58:41,156
“?今?子得了?耀， Now the Son of Man's glory is revealed.

1452
01:58:42,199 --> 01:58:44,952
　神在?子身上也得了?耀。 (13:31) Now God's glory is revealed through him.

1453
01:58:45,744 --> 01:58:48,747
神要因自己 And if God's glory is revealed through him...

1454
01:58:49,623 --> 01:58:53,335
?耀?子， then God will reveal the glory  of the Son of Man in himself.

1455
01:58:55,045 --> 01:58:57,089
并?要快快地?耀他。 (13:32) And he will do so at once.

1456
01:59:08,767 --> 01:59:10,269
小子们， My children...

1457
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:15,524
我还有不多的时候与你们魂在， I shall not be with you very much longer.

1458
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:21,029
后来你们要找我，但我所?的地方你们不能到。这话我曾对漠太?说过，?今也照样对你们说。 You will look for me, but I tell you now  what I told the Jewish authorities:

1459
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:24,074
后来你们要找我，但我所?的地方你们不能到。这话我曾对漠太?说过，?今也照样对你们说。 (13:33) You cannot go where I am going.

1460
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:37,546
我赐给你们一条新命令，乃是叫你们 And now I give you a new commandment:

1461
01:59:39,423 --> 01:59:41,049
彼此相爱； Love one another.

1462
01:59:42,676 --> 01:59:45,888
我怎样爱你们，你们也要怎样相爱。 (13:34) As I have loved you,  so you must love one another.

1463
01:59:46,972 --> 01:59:49,475
你们?有彼此相爱的心， If you have love for one another...

1464
01:59:50,017 --> 01:59:53,228
众?因此就?出你们是我的门徒了。” (13:35) then everyone will know  that you are my disciples.

1465
01:59:53,645 --> 01:59:55,063
西门彼得问耶稣说：“主往哪里?？” Where are you going, Lord?

1466
01:59:55,105 --> 01:59:57,858
耶稣回答说：“我所?的地方，你现在不能跟我?， You cannot follow me now  where I am going...

1467
01:59:57,941 --> 01:59:59,485
后来?要跟我?。” (13:36) but later you will follow me.

1468
01:59:59,568 --> 02:00:03,614
彼得说：“主啊，我为什么现在不能跟你?？我愿意为你舍命。” (13:37) Lord, why can't I follow you now?  I am ready to die for you.

1469
02:00:07,576 --> 02:00:10,078
  耶稣说：“你愿意为我舍命吗？ Are you really ready to die for me?

1470
02:00:12,915 --> 02:00:15,083
我实实在在地告诉你： I am telling you the truth.

1471
02:00:16,376 --> 02:00:20,923
鸡叫以先，你要?次不?我。 (13:38) Before the rooster crows, you will say  three times that you do not know me.

1472
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:23,467
你们心里不要忧愁， Do not be worried and upset.

1473
02:00:25,803 --> 02:00:27,429
你们信　神， Believe in God...

1474
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:30,516
也当信我。(14:1) and believe, also, in me.

1475
02:00:31,225 --> 02:00:34,144
在我父的家里有许多住处；?是没有，我就早已告诉你们了；我?原是为你们预备地方?。  There are many rooms  in my Father's house...

1476
02:00:34,728 --> 02:00:37,564
在我父的家里有许多住处；?是没有，我就早已告诉你们了；我?原是为你们预备地方?。  and I am going to prepare a place for you.

1477
02:00:38,732 --> 02:00:41,652
在我父的家里有许多住处；?是没有，我就早已告诉你们了；我?原是为你们预备地方?。 (14:2) I would not tell you this if it were not so.

1478
02:00:42,694 --> 02:00:46,949
我??为你们预备了地方，就必再来接你们到我那里?； And after I go and prepare a place for you,  I will come back and take you to myself...

1479
02:00:47,658 --> 02:00:49,952
我在哪里，叫你们也在那里。 (14:3) so that you will be where I am.

1480
02:00:51,161 --> 02:00:54,540
我往哪里?，你们知道；那条路，你们也知道（注：有古卷作“我往哪里?，你们知道那条路”）。” (14:4) You know the way that leads  to the place where I am going.

1481
02:00:54,748 --> 02:00:59,044
多马对他说：“主啊，我们不知道你往哪里?， Lord, we do not know  where you are going...

1482
02:00:59,169 --> 02:01:01,922
怎么知道那条路呢？ ”(14:5) so how can we know the way to get there?

1483
02:01:02,131 --> 02:01:03,632
耶稣说：“我就是道路、 I am the way...

1484
02:01:04,716 --> 02:01:06,677
真理、生命； the truth, and the life.

1485
02:01:08,846 --> 02:01:11,557
?不藉着我，没有?能到父那里?。 (14:6) No one goes to the Father except by me.

1486
02:01:15,352 --> 02:01:18,730
你们??识我，也就?识我的父。 Now that you have known me,  you will know my Father also.

1487
02:01:18,981 --> 02:01:22,443
从今以后，你们?识他，并?已经看见他。” (14:7) And from now on,  you do know him, and you have seen him.

1488
02:01:23,026 --> 02:01:24,194
腓力对他说：“?主 Lord...

1489
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:28,824
将父显给我们看， show us the Father.

1490
02:01:29,700 --> 02:01:31,452
我们就知足了。” (14:8) That is all we need.

1491
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:36,290
耶稣对他说：“腓力，我与你们魂在这样长久， For a long time, I have been with you all.

1492
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:39,084
你还不?识我吗？ Yet you do not know me, Philip?

1493
02:01:40,377 --> 02:01:42,212
?看见了我，就是看见了父， Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.

1494
02:01:42,296 --> 02:01:45,215
你怎么说‘将父显给我们看’呢？ (14:9) Why, then, do you say,  "Show us the Father"?

1495
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:50,971
我在父里面，父在我里面，你不信吗？ Do you not believe, Philip, that I am  in the Father and the Father is in me?

1496
02:01:52,723 --> 02:01:55,976
我对你们所说的话，不是?着自己说的， The words I have spoken to you  do not come from me.

1497
02:01:56,185 --> 02:01:59,646
乃是住在我里面的父做他自己的事。 (14:10) The Father, who remains in me,  does his own work.

1498
02:02:00,773 --> 02:02:05,027
  你们当信我，我在父里面，父在我里面； Believe me when I say that I am in the Father  and the Father is in me.

1499
02:02:05,194 --> 02:02:08,071
即或不信，也当因我所做的事信我。  (14:11) If not, believe because of the things I do.

1500
02:02:08,947 --> 02:02:11,033
我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

1501
02:02:12,075 --> 02:02:16,538
我所做的事，信我的?也要做；并?要做比这更大的事， Those who believe in me will do what I do.  Yes, they will do even greater things...

1502
02:02:16,580 --> 02:02:18,999
因为我往父那里?。 (14:12) because I am going to the Father.

1503
02:02:19,917 --> 02:02:23,170
你们奉我的名无论?什么，我必成就， And I will do whatever you ask for  in my name...

1504
02:02:24,004 --> 02:02:27,549
叫父因儿子得?耀。 (14:13) so that the Father's glory  will be shown through the Son.

1505
02:02:28,926 --> 02:02:31,678
只要你们奉我的名所?... If you ask me for anything in my name...

1506
02:02:33,013 --> 02:02:34,473
你们?奉我的名?什么，我必成就。(14:14) I will do it.

1507
02:02:38,977 --> 02:02:41,980
你们?爱我，就必遵守我的命令。 (14:15) If you love me,  you will obey my commandments.

1508
02:02:42,564 --> 02:02:45,317
我要?父，父就另外赐给你们一位保惠师（注：或作“训慰师”。下魂）， I will ask the Father,  and he will give you another Helper...

1509
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:47,236
叫他永远与你们魂在， (14:16) who will stay with you forever.

1510
02:02:47,361 --> 02:02:50,280
就是真理的圣灵， He is the Spirit  who reveals the truth about God.

1511
02:02:50,322 --> 02:02:54,493
乃世?不能接受的，因为不见他，也不?识他； The world cannot receive him,  because it cannot see him or know him.

1512
02:02:54,868 --> 02:02:58,580
你们??识他，因他常与你们魂在，也要在你们里面。 (14:17) But you know him,  because he remains with you and is in you.

1513
02:02:59,665 --> 02:03:04,002
我不?下你们为孤儿，我必到你们这里来。 (14:18) When I go, you will not be left all alone.  I will come back to you.

1514
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:07,798
还有不多的时候，世?不再看见我； In a little while,  the world will see me no more...

1515
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:09,591
你们?看见我， but you will see me.

1516
02:03:10,008 --> 02:03:12,845
因为我活着，你们也要活着。 (14:19) And because I live, you also will live.

1517
02:03:14,221 --> 02:03:15,639
到那? When that day comes...

1518
02:03:15,806 --> 02:03:20,727
你们就知道我在父里面，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。 (14:20) you will know that I am in my Father,  and that you are in me, just as I am in you.

1519
02:03:22,062 --> 02:03:25,482
有了我的命令又遵守的，这?就是爱我的； Those who accept my commandments  and obey them are the ones who love me.

1520
02:03:25,566 --> 02:03:28,193
爱我的必蒙我父爱他，  My Father will love those who love me.

1521
02:03:29,111 --> 02:03:32,406
我也要爱他，并?要向他显现。” (14:21) I, too, will love them  and reveal myself to them.

1522
02:03:32,906 --> 02:03:36,160
漠大（不是加略?漠大）问耶稣说： Judas, not Judas Iscariot, said.:

1523
02:03:36,535 --> 02:03:41,498
“主啊，为什么要向我们显现，不向世?显现呢？” (14:22) Lord, how can it be that you will  reveal yourself to us and not to the world?

1524
02:03:42,124 --> 02:03:44,793
耶稣回答说：“??爱我，就必遵守我的道， Those who love me will obey my teaching.

1525
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:48,881
我父也必爱他，并?我们要到他那里?，与他魂住。 (14:23) My Father will love them, and my Father  and I will come to them and live with them.

1526
02:03:48,964 --> 02:03:52,134
不爱我的?就不遵守我的道， Those who do not love me  do not obey my teaching.

1527
02:03:53,218 --> 02:03:57,431
你们所听见的道不是我的，乃是差我来之父的道。 (14:24) The teaching you have heard is not mine,  but comes from the Father who sent me.

1528
02:03:57,514 --> 02:04:00,058
我还与你们魂住的时候，已将这些话对你们说了。(14:25) I have told you this while I am still with you.

1529
02:04:00,142 --> 02:04:03,353
但保惠师，就是父因我的名所要差来的圣灵， The Helper, the Holy Spirit,  whom the Father will send in my name...

1530
02:04:03,437 --> 02:04:07,858
他要将一?的事指教你们，并?要叫你们想?我对你们所说的一?话。 (14:26) will teach you everything and  make you remember all that I have told you.

1531
02:04:09,318 --> 02:04:12,571
我留下?安给你们， Peace is what I leave with you.

1532
02:04:16,366 --> 02:04:18,827
我将我的?安赐给你们。 It is my own peace that I give you.

1533
02:04:18,994 --> 02:04:21,497
我所赐的，不像世?所赐的； I do not give it as the world does.

1534
02:04:21,789 --> 02:04:24,917
你们心里不要忧愁，也不要胆?。 (14:27)  Do not be worried and upset.  Do not be afraid.

1535
02:04:25,083 --> 02:04:29,546
你们听见我对你们说了，我?还要到你们这里来。 You heard me say to you,  "I am leaving, but I will come back to you."

1536
02:04:31,799 --> 02:04:35,928
你们?爱我，因我到父那里?，就必喜乐， If you loved me, you would be glad  that I am going to the Father...

1537
02:04:36,261 --> 02:04:38,263
因为父是比我大的。(14:28) for he is greater than I.

1538
02:04:39,598 --> 02:04:42,768
现在事?还没有成就，我预先告诉你们， I have told you this now  before it all happens...

1539
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:46,563
叫你们到事?成就的时候，就可以信。 (14:29) so that when it does happen,  you will believe.

1540
02:04:47,731 --> 02:04:50,317
以后我不再和你们多说话， I cannot talk with you much longer...

1541
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:52,903
因为这世界的王将到， because the ruler of this world is coming.

1542
02:04:52,986 --> 02:04:56,406
他在我里面是毫无所有；(14:30) 但要叫世?知道 He has no power over me,  but the world must know...

1543
02:04:57,491 --> 02:05:01,370
我爱父，并?父怎样吩咐我，我就怎样行。 that I love the Father, and that is why  I do everything as he commands me.

1544
02:05:01,578 --> 02:05:04,206
?来，我们走吧。 (14:31) Come, let us go from this place.

1545
02:05:06,416 --> 02:05:09,586
我是真?萄树，我父是栽培的?。(15:1) I am the real vine,  and my Father is the gardener.

1546
02:05:10,462 --> 02:05:13,924
凡属我不结果子的枝子，他就剪?； He breaks off every branch in me  that does not bear fruit...

1547
02:05:14,174 --> 02:05:17,386
凡结果子的，他就囊理干净， and he prunes every branch  that does bear fruit...

1548
02:05:17,553 --> 02:05:20,556
使枝子结果子更多。(15:2) so that it will be clean and bear more fruit.

1549
02:05:21,140 --> 02:05:25,227
现在你们因我讲给你们的道，已经干净了。(15:3) You have been made clean already  by the teaching I have given you.

1550
02:05:26,270 --> 02:05:28,105
你们要常在我里面， Remain united to me...

1551
02:05:30,232 --> 02:05:32,568
我也常在你们里面。 and I will remain united to you.

1552
02:05:39,741 --> 02:05:42,327
枝子?不常在?萄树上， A branch cannot bear fruit by itself.

1553
02:05:42,953 --> 02:05:45,873
自己就不能结果子； It can do so only if it remains on the vine.

1554
02:05:46,457 --> 02:05:49,543
你们?不常在我里面，也是这样。 (15:4) In the same way, you cannot bear fruit  unless you remain in me.

1555
02:05:49,668 --> 02:05:53,922
我是?萄树，你们是枝子； I am the vine, and you are the branches.

1556
02:05:56,759 --> 02:05:59,803
常在我里面的，我也常在他里面，这?就多结果子。 Those who remain in me, and I in them,  will bear much fruit...

1557
02:05:59,928 --> 02:06:01,972
因为离了我，你们就不能做什么。 (15:5) for you can do nothing without me.

1558
02:06:02,097 --> 02:06:06,643
??不常在我里面，就像枝子丢在外面枯干， Those who do not remain in me  are thrown out like a branch and dry up.

1559
02:06:08,145 --> 02:06:12,107
?拾?来 Such branches are gathered up  and thrown into the fire...

1560
02:06:12,941 --> 02:06:14,777
?在火里烧了。 (15:6) where they are burned.

1561
02:06:16,945 --> 02:06:20,115
你们?常在我里面，我的话也常在你们里面；凡你们所愿意的，??就给你们成就。(15:7) If you remain in me  and my words remain in you...

1562
02:06:20,240 --> 02:06:24,161
你们多结果子， then you will ask for anything you wish,  and you shall have it.

1563
02:06:25,287 --> 02:06:28,791
我父就因此得?耀， My Father's glory is shown  by your bearing much fruit...

1564
02:06:29,333 --> 02:06:32,044
你们也就是我的门徒了。(15:8) and in this way, you become my disciples.

1565
02:06:32,878 --> 02:06:36,048
我爱你们，正?父爱我一样， I love you, just as the Father loves me.

1566
02:06:36,673 --> 02:06:38,342
你们要常在我的爱里。 (15:9) Remain in my love.

1567
02:06:39,843 --> 02:06:43,138
你们?遵守我的命令，就常在我的爱里； If you obey my commands,  you will remain in my love...

1568
02:06:43,305 --> 02:06:47,351
正?我遵守了我父的命令，常在他的爱里。 (15:10) just as I have obeyed my Father's  commands, and remain in his love.

1569
02:06:48,018 --> 02:06:51,313
这些事我已经对你们说了，是要叫我的喜乐存在你们心里， I have told you this  so that my joy may be in you...

1570
02:06:51,647 --> 02:06:53,649
并叫你们的喜乐可以满足。 (15:11) and that your joy may be complete.

1571
02:06:53,732 --> 02:06:58,153
你们要彼此相爱，像我爱你们一样，这就是我的命令。　 (15:12) My commandment is this.:  Love one another, just as I love you.

1572
02:06:58,195 --> 02:07:01,990
?为朋友舍命，?的爱心没有比这个大的。 (15:13) The greatest love you can have  for your friends is to give your life for them.

1573
02:07:02,157 --> 02:07:05,744
你们?遵行我所吩咐的，就是我的朋友了。 (15:14) And you are my friends  if you do what I command you.

1574
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:09,039
以后我不再称你们为??， I do not call you servants any longer...

1575
02:07:09,206 --> 02:07:12,167
因??不知道主?所做的事； because servants do not know  what their master is doing.

1576
02:07:12,376 --> 02:07:16,797
我乃称你们为朋友，因我从我父所听见的，已经都告诉你们了。(15:15) Instead, I call you friends, because I have  told you everything I heard from my Father.

1577
02:07:18,590 --> 02:07:20,551
不是你们拣选了我， You did not choose me.

1578
02:07:21,218 --> 02:07:22,678
是我拣选了你们； I chose you...

1579
02:07:23,637 --> 02:07:26,640
并?分派你们?结果子， and appointed you  to go and bear much fruit...

1580
02:07:26,890 --> 02:07:29,184
叫你们的果子常存， the kind of fruit that endures.

1581
02:07:31,311 --> 02:07:32,563
使你们 And so...

1582
02:07:34,398 --> 02:07:37,985
奉我的名，无论向父?什么，他就赐给你们。 (15:16) the Father will give you  whatever you ask of him in my name.

1583
02:07:38,235 --> 02:07:40,654
我这样吩咐你们，是要叫你们 This, then, is what I command you:

1584
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:47,286
彼此相爱。(15:17) Love one another.

1585
02:07:49,580 --> 02:07:51,540
世??恨你们， If the world hates you...

1586
02:07:52,082 --> 02:07:56,211
你们知道（注：或作“该知道”）恨你们以先，已经恨我了。 (15:18) just remember that it has hated me first.

1587
02:08:00,716 --> 02:08:05,053
你们?属世界，世界必爱属自己的； If you belonged to the world,  then the world would love you as its own.

1588
02:08:05,804 --> 02:08:09,600
只因你们不属世界，乃是我从世界中拣选了你们， But I chose you from this world,  and you do not belong to it.

1589
02:08:10,851 --> 02:08:13,187
所以世界就恨你们。 (15:19) That is why the world hates you.

1590
02:08:13,771 --> 02:08:18,025
  你们要记念我从?对你们所说的话：‘??不能大于主?。’ Remember what I told you.  "Slaves are not greater than their master. "

1591
02:08:20,110 --> 02:08:23,572
他们?逼?了我，也要逼?你们； If people persecuted me,  they will persecute you, too.

1592
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:28,452
?遵守了我的话，也要遵守你们的话。  (15:20) If they obeyed my teaching,  they will obey yours, too.

1593
02:08:29,536 --> 02:08:32,915
但他们因我的名要向你们行这一?的事， But they will do all this to you  because you are mine...

1594
02:08:32,956 --> 02:08:35,751
因为他们不?识那差我来的。 (15:21) for they do not know the One who sent me.

1595
02:08:35,834 --> 02:08:40,172
我?没有来教训他们，他们就没有罪； They would not have been guilty of sin  if I had not come and spoken to them.

1596
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:44,259
但?今他们的罪无可推诿了。  (15:22) As it is, they no longer have  any excuse for their sin.

1597
02:08:45,928 --> 02:08:48,764
恨我的，也恨我的父。 (15:23) Whoever hates me hates my Father also.

1598
02:08:49,139 --> 02:08:51,350
我?没有在他们中间行过别?未曾行的事， They would not have been guilty of sin...

1599
02:08:51,433 --> 02:08:55,479
他们就没有罪； if I had not done among them  the things that no one else ever did.

1600
02:08:56,438 --> 02:08:59,274
但?今连我与我的父， As it is, they have seen what I did...

1601
02:08:59,983 --> 02:09:02,528
他们也看见也恨恶了。 (15:24) and they hate both me and my Father.

1602
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:05,531
这要应验 This, however, was bound to happen...

1603
02:09:05,697 --> 02:09:08,951
他们律法上所写的话， so that what is written in their Law  may come true.:

1604
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:12,246
说：‘他们无故地恨我。’(15:25) "They hated me for no reason at all. "

1605
02:09:13,831 --> 02:09:15,415
但我要从父那里差保惠师来， The Helper will come...

1606
02:09:15,624 --> 02:09:19,586
就是从父出来真理的圣灵， the Spirit who reveals the truth about God  and who comes from the Father.

1607
02:09:19,670 --> 02:09:22,840
他来了，就要为我作见证。 (15:26) I will send him to you from the Father,  and he will speak about me.

1608
02:09:22,965 --> 02:09:24,716
你们也要作见证， And you, too, will speak about me...

1609
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:28,220
因为你们从?头就与我魂在。 (15:27) because you have been with me  from the very beginning.

1610
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:32,808
我已将这些事告诉你们，使你们不至于跌倒。 (16:1) I have told you this  so that you will not give up your faith.

1611
02:09:33,684 --> 02:09:36,437
?要把你们赶出会堂， You will be expelled from the synagogues...

1612
02:09:36,687 --> 02:09:39,815
并?时候将到， and the time will come  when those who kill you...

1613
02:09:40,023 --> 02:09:43,318
凡杀你们的，就以为是事奉神。 (16:2) will think that by doing this  they are serving God.

1614
02:09:45,112 --> 02:09:47,698
他们这样行， People will do these things to you...

1615
02:09:48,198 --> 02:09:51,493
是因未曾?识父，也未曾?识我。 (16:3) because they have not known  either the Father or me.

1616
02:09:52,703 --> 02:09:54,830
我将这事告诉你们， But I have told you this...

1617
02:09:55,581 --> 02:09:58,917
是叫你们到了时候， so that when the time comes  for them to do these things...

1618
02:09:59,543 --> 02:10:02,004
可以想?我对你们说过了。 you will remember what I told you.

1619
02:10:02,546 --> 02:10:06,717
我?先没有将这事告诉你们，因为我与你们魂在。(16:4) I did not tell you these things  at the beginning, for I was with you.

1620
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:09,511
现今我往差我来的父那里?， But now I am going to him who sent me...

1621
02:10:09,678 --> 02:10:12,473
你们中间并没有?问我：‘你往哪里?？’(16:5) yet none of you asks me where I am going.

1622
02:10:13,557 --> 02:10:17,394
只因我将这事告诉你们，你们就满心忧愁。 (16:6) And now that I have told you,  your hearts are full of sadness.

1623
02:10:18,937 --> 02:10:21,231
?而我将真?告诉你们， But I am telling you the truth.

1624
02:10:22,274 --> 02:10:24,818
我?是与你们有益的。 It is better for you that I go away.

1625
02:10:25,694 --> 02:10:29,364
我?不?，保惠师就不到你们这里来； Because if I do not go,  the Helper will not come to you.

1626
02:10:30,908 --> 02:10:34,787
我??，就差他来。 (16:7) But if I do go away,  then I will send him to you.

1627
02:10:36,205 --> 02:10:40,042
他既来了，就要叫世? And when he comes,  he will prove to the people of the world...

1628
02:10:40,959 --> 02:10:44,505
为罪、为义、 that they are wrong about sin,  and about what is right...

1629
02:10:45,422 --> 02:10:47,424
为诀判，自己责备自己。 (16:8) and about God's judgment.

1630
02:10:48,842 --> 02:10:52,096
为罪，是因他们不信我； (16:9) They are wrong about sin  because they do not believe in me.

1631
02:10:52,930 --> 02:10:55,015
为义， They are wrong about what is right...

1632
02:10:55,099 --> 02:10:59,061
是因我往父那里?，你们就不再见我； (16:10) because I am going to the Father  and you will not see me anymore.

1633
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:03,023
为诀判， And they are wrong about judgment...

1634
02:11:03,607 --> 02:11:06,068
是因这世界的王 because the ruler of this world...

1635
02:11:06,485 --> 02:11:08,445
受了诀判。” (16:11) has already been judged.

1636
02:11:10,781 --> 02:11:13,033
我还有好些事要告诉你们， I have much more to tell you...

1637
02:11:13,117 --> 02:11:15,786
但你们现在担当不了（注：或作“不能领会”）。 (16:12) but now, it would be too much  for you to bear.

1638
02:11:15,869 --> 02:11:19,915
只等真理的圣灵来了， When, however, the Spirit comes,  who reveals the truth about God...

1639
02:11:19,998 --> 02:11:22,251
他要引导你们明白（注：原文作“进?”）一?的真理， he will lead you into all the truth.

1640
02:11:22,292 --> 02:11:25,963
因为他不是?自己说的， He will not speak on his own authority,  but he will speak of what he hears...

1641
02:11:26,046 --> 02:11:28,006
乃是把他所听见的都说出来，并要把将来的事告诉你们。  (16:13) and will tell you of things to come.

1642
02:11:28,090 --> 02:11:32,553
他要?耀我，因为他要将受于我的告诉你们。 (16:14) He will give me glory, because he will  take what I say and tell it to you.

1643
02:11:32,886 --> 02:11:35,180
凡父所有的，都是我的， All that my Father has is mine.

1644
02:11:35,681 --> 02:11:40,227
所以我说，他要将受于我的告诉你们。 (16:15) That is why I said that the Spirit will take  what I give him and tell it to you.

1645
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:43,355
等不多时，你们就不得见我； In a little while,  you will not see me anymore.

1646
02:11:46,442 --> 02:11:49,236
再等不多时，你们还要见我。” (16:16) And then, a little while later,  you will see me.

1647
02:11:49,695 --> 02:11:54,032
有几个门徒就彼此说： Some of his disciples asked  among themselves, "What does this mean?

1648
02:11:55,075 --> 02:11:58,328
“他对我们说‘等不多时，你们就不得见我； "He tells us that in a little while,  we will not see him...

1649
02:11:58,454 --> 02:12:01,039
再等不多时，你们还要见我’； "and then a little while later,  we will see him.

1650
02:12:01,123 --> 02:12:04,585
又说‘因我往父那里?’，这是什么意思呢？” (16:17) "and he also says, 'It is because  I am going to the Father. '

1651
02:12:05,085 --> 02:12:08,255
门徒彼此说：“他说‘等不多时’到底是什么意思呢？ "What does this 'a little while' mean?

1652
02:12:08,839 --> 02:12:11,467
我们不明白他所说的话。” (16:18) "We don't know what he is talking about. "

1653
02:12:11,592 --> 02:12:14,136
耶稣看出他们要问他，就说： Jesus knew  that they wanted to question him.

1654
02:12:15,304 --> 02:12:18,474
“我说‘等不多时，你们就不得见我； I said, "In a little while,  you will not see me...

1655
02:12:19,016 --> 02:12:21,810
再等不多时，你们还要见我’， "and then, a little while later,  you will see me."

1656
02:12:21,852 --> 02:12:25,147
你们为这话彼此相问吗？ (16:19)  Is this what you are asking about  among yourselves?

1657
02:12:25,481 --> 02:12:27,441
我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

1658
02:12:27,524 --> 02:12:31,069
你们将要痛哭、哀号，世?倒要喜乐； You will cry and weep,  but the world will be glad.

1659
02:12:31,820 --> 02:12:35,115
你们将要忧愁，?而你们的忧愁要变为喜乐。 (16:20) You will be sad,  but your sadness will turn into gladness.

1660
02:12:35,199 --> 02:12:39,328
妇?生产的时候就忧愁，因为她的时候到了； When a woman is about to give birth, she is  sad because her hour of suffering has come.

1661
02:12:39,369 --> 02:12:43,123
既生了孩子，就不再记念那苦楚， But when the baby is born,  she forgets her suffering...

1662
02:12:44,041 --> 02:12:47,878
因为欢喜世上生了一个?。 (16:21) because she is happy  that a baby has been born into the world.

1663
02:12:48,337 --> 02:12:51,507
你们现在也是忧愁， That is how it is with you.  Now you are sad...

1664
02:12:52,508 --> 02:12:56,178
但我要再见你们，你们的心就喜乐了； but I will see you again, and your hearts  will be filled with gladness...

1665
02:12:56,261 --> 02:12:59,807
这喜乐也没有?能夺?。(16:22)  the kind of gladness  that no one can take away from you.

1666
02:13:00,808 --> 02:13:05,020
到那?，你们什么也就不问我了。 When that day comes,  you will not ask me for anything.

1667
02:13:06,313 --> 02:13:07,898
我实实在在地告诉你们： I am telling you the truth.

1668
02:13:07,981 --> 02:13:11,693
你们?向父?什么，他必因我的名赐给你们。 (16:23) The Father will give you  whatever you ask of him in my name.

1669
02:13:12,361 --> 02:13:15,405
向来你们没有奉我的名?什么， Until now, you have not asked for anything  in my name.

1670
02:13:15,489 --> 02:13:17,574
?今你们?就必得着， Ask, and you will receive...

1671
02:13:18,283 --> 02:13:20,994
叫你们的喜乐可以满足。  (16:24) so that your happiness may be complete.

1672
02:13:28,127 --> 02:13:31,547
这些事，我是用比喻对你们说的； I have used figures of speech  to tell you these things.

1673
02:13:31,588 --> 02:13:33,841
时候将到，我不再用比喻对你们说， But the time will come  when I will not do so...

1674
02:13:33,924 --> 02:13:36,718
乃要将父明明地告诉你们。 (16:25) but will speak to you plainly  about the Father.

1675
02:13:36,802 --> 02:13:39,805
到那?，你们要奉我的名??； When that day comes,  you will ask him in my name.

1676
02:13:39,888 --> 02:13:42,558
我并不对你们说，我要为你们?父。 (16:26) And I do not say  that I will ask him on your behalf...

1677
02:13:42,641 --> 02:13:45,060
父自己爱你们， for the Father himself loves you.

1678
02:13:45,269 --> 02:13:49,648
因为你们已经爱我，又信我是从父出来的。 (16:27) He loves you because you love me  and have believed that I came from God.

1679
02:13:50,941 --> 02:13:54,653
我从父出来，到了世界； I did come from the Father,  and I came into the world...

1680
02:13:56,572 --> 02:14:00,033
我又离开世界，往父那里?。” (16:28) and now I am leaving the world  and going to the Father.

1681
02:14:00,951 --> 02:14:02,870
门徒说： Then his disciples said to him...

1682
02:14:02,953 --> 02:14:06,623
“?今你是明说，并不用比喻了。 (16:29) "Now you are speaking plainly  without using figures of speech.

1683
02:14:06,707 --> 02:14:09,376
现在我们晓得你凡事都知道， "We know now that you know everything.

1684
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:12,129
也不用?问你， "You do not need to have someone  ask you questions.

1685
02:14:12,212 --> 02:14:15,674
因此我们信你是从　神出来的。”(16:30) "This makes us believe  that you came from God. "

1686
02:14:20,095 --> 02:14:24,224
耶稣说：“现在你们信吗？ (16:31) 看哪，时候将到，?是已经到了， Do you believe now?  The time is coming, it is already here...

1687
02:14:24,641 --> 02:14:28,687
你们要分散，各归自己的地方?， when all of you will be scattered,  each of you to your own home...

1688
02:14:29,897 --> 02:14:31,774
留下我独自一?； and I will be left all alone.

1689
02:14:33,066 --> 02:14:36,487
?实我不是独自一?，因为有父与我魂在。  (16:32) But I am not really alone,  because the Father is with me.

1690
02:14:36,570 --> 02:14:39,990
我将这些事告诉你们，是要叫你们在我里面有?安。 I have told you this so that  you will have peace by being united to me.

1691
02:14:40,032 --> 02:14:42,993
在世上你们有苦难，但你们可以放心， The world will make you suffer.  But be brave.

1692
02:14:43,827 --> 02:14:45,871
我已经痉了世界。” (16:33) I have defeated the world.

1693
02:14:47,664 --> 02:14:52,377
耶稣说了这话，就举目望天说： After Jesus finished saying this,  he looked up to heaven and said.:

1694
02:14:56,465 --> 02:14:57,716
“父啊， Father...

1695
02:14:59,426 --> 02:15:01,095
时候到了， the hour has come.

1696
02:15:02,471 --> 02:15:04,473
愿你?耀你的儿子， Give glory to your Son...

1697
02:15:06,225 --> 02:15:08,852
使儿子也?耀你；(17:1) so that the Son may give glory to you.

1698
02:15:11,438 --> 02:15:14,191
正?你曾赐给他?柄，管理凡有血?的， For you gave him authority over all people...

1699
02:15:14,274 --> 02:15:18,070
叫他将永生赐给你所赐给他的?。 (17:2) so that he might give eternal life  to all those you gave him.

1700
02:15:18,195 --> 02:15:21,740
?识你独一的真　神，并??识你所差来的耶稣基督， And eternal life means to know you,  the only true God...

1701
02:15:21,865 --> 02:15:24,576
这就是永生。 (17:3) and to know Jesus Christ, whom you sent.

1702
02:15:24,827 --> 02:15:27,204
我在地上已经?耀你， I have shown your glory on Earth.

1703
02:15:27,663 --> 02:15:30,541
你所托付我的事，我已成?了。 (17:4) I have finished the work you gave me to do.

1704
02:15:30,707 --> 02:15:31,959
父啊， Father...

1705
02:15:32,543 --> 02:15:34,920
现在?你使我魂你享?耀， give me glory in your presence now...

1706
02:15:35,003 --> 02:15:38,507
就是未有世界以先，我魂你所有的?耀。 (17:5) the same glory I had with you  before the world was made.

1707
02:15:39,174 --> 02:15:42,678
你从世上赐给我的?， I have made you known  to those you gave me out of the world.

1708
02:15:42,761 --> 02:15:46,014
我已将你的名显明与他们。 They belonged to you,  and you gave them to me.

1709
02:15:46,765 --> 02:15:48,058
他们本是你的，你将他们赐给我，他们也遵守了你的道。 (17:6) They have obeyed your word...

1710
02:15:48,142 --> 02:15:51,562
?今他们知道，凡你所赐给我的，都是从你那里来的； (17:7) and now they know that everything  you gave me comes from you.

1711
02:15:51,645 --> 02:15:55,274
因为你所赐给我的道，我已经赐给他们。他们也领受了， I gave them the message that you gave me,  and they received it.

1712
02:15:55,357 --> 02:15:58,193
又?实知道，我是从你出来的， They know that it is true  that I came from you...

1713
02:15:58,235 --> 02:16:00,696
并?信你差了我来。 (17:8) and they believe that you sent me.

1714
02:16:00,779 --> 02:16:02,364
我为他们??， I pray for them.

1715
02:16:02,865 --> 02:16:05,742
不为世???，?为你所赐给我的???， I do not pray for the world,  but for those you gave me...

1716
02:16:05,826 --> 02:16:07,744
因他们本是你的。 (17:9) for they belong to you.

1717
02:16:14,334 --> 02:16:16,211
凡是我的都是你的， All I have is yours...

1718
02:16:17,921 --> 02:16:19,923
你的也是我的， and all you have is mine.

1719
02:16:21,550 --> 02:16:24,011
并?我因他们得了?耀。(17:10)  And my glory is shown through them.

1720
02:16:25,137 --> 02:16:27,222
从今以后，我不在世上， And now I am coming to you.

1721
02:16:28,182 --> 02:16:31,643
他们?在世上；我往你那里?。 I am no longer in the world,  but they are in the world.

1722
02:16:32,102 --> 02:16:35,606
圣父啊，?你因你所赐给我的名保守他们， Holy Father, keep them safe  by the power of your name...

1723
02:16:35,981 --> 02:16:37,900
圣父啊，?你因你所赐给我的名保守他们， the name you gave me...

1724
02:16:39,026 --> 02:16:41,069
叫他们合而为一， so that they may be one...

1725
02:16:41,612 --> 02:16:43,655
像我们一样。 (17:11) just as you and I are one.

1726
02:16:44,865 --> 02:16:48,118
我与他们魂在的时候， While I was with them, I kept them safe  by the power of your name...

1727
02:16:48,202 --> 02:16:49,995
因你所赐给我的名保守了他们， the name you gave me.

1728
02:16:50,370 --> 02:16:53,207
我也护卫了他们； I protected them,  and not one of them was lost...

1729
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:58,045
?中除了那灭亡之子，没有一个灭亡的，好叫经上的话得应验。 (17:12) except the man who was bound to be lost,  so that the Scripture might come true.

1730
02:16:59,338 --> 02:17:03,467
现在我往你那里?，我还在世上说这话， And now, I am coming to you,  and I say these things in the world...

1731
02:17:03,592 --> 02:17:07,596
是叫他们心里充满我的喜乐。(17:13) so that they may have my joy in their hearts  in all its fullness.

1732
02:17:08,305 --> 02:17:11,308
我已将你的道赐给他们。世界又恨他们， I gave them your message,  and the world hated them...

1733
02:17:11,391 --> 02:17:15,604
因为他们不属世界，正?我不属世界一样。 (17:14) because they do not belong to the world,  just as I do not belong to the world.

1734
02:17:15,646 --> 02:17:18,816
我不?你叫他们离开世界， I do not ask you  to take them out of the world...

1735
02:17:19,316 --> 02:17:22,653
只?你保守他们脱离那恶者（注：或作“ 脱离罪恶”）。 (17:15) but I do ask you to keep them safe  from the Evil One.

1736
02:17:23,403 --> 02:17:27,366
他们不属世界，正?我不属世界一样。 (17:16) Just as I do not belong to the world,  they do not belong to the world.

1737
02:17:27,449 --> 02:17:30,536
?你用真理使他们成圣， Dedicate them to yourself  by means of the truth.

1738
02:17:31,036 --> 02:17:34,248
你的道就是真理。  (17:17) Your Word is truth.

1739
02:17:35,749 --> 02:17:39,753
你怎样差我到世上，我也照样差他们到世上。 (17:18) I sent them into the world,  just as you sent me into the world.

1740
02:17:40,504 --> 02:17:43,465
我为他们的缘故，自己分别为圣， And for their sake,  I dedicate myself to you...

1741
02:17:43,507 --> 02:17:47,428
叫他们也因真理成圣。  (17:19) in order that they, too,  may be truly dedicated to you.

1742
02:17:48,345 --> 02:17:53,267
我不但为这些???，也为那些因他们的话信我的???， (17:20) I pray not only for them, but also for those  who believe in me because of their message.

1743
02:17:53,517 --> 02:17:56,103
使他们都合而为一。 I pray that they may all be one.

1744
02:17:56,854 --> 02:17:58,105
正?你父在我里面，我在你里面，使他们也在我们里面， Father...

1745
02:17:58,564 --> 02:18:02,568
正?你父在我里面，我在你里面，使他们也在我们里面， may they be in us,  just as you are in me and I am in you.

1746
02:18:03,861 --> 02:18:07,823
叫世?可以信你差了我来。(17:21) May they be one, so that the world  will believe that you sent me.

1747
02:18:08,282 --> 02:18:11,076
你所赐给我的?耀，我已赐给他们， I gave them the same glory you gave me...

1748
02:18:11,535 --> 02:18:14,746
使他们合而为一，像我们合而为一。  (17:22) so that they may be one,  just as you and I are one...

1749
02:18:14,830 --> 02:18:16,832
我在他们里面，你在我里面， I in them, and you in me...

1750
02:18:17,541 --> 02:18:19,960
使他们完完??地合而为一， so that they may be completely one...

1751
02:18:20,043 --> 02:18:23,255
叫世?知道你差了我来， in order that the world may know  that you sent me...

1752
02:18:23,338 --> 02:18:25,966
也知道你爱他们?魂爱我一样。 (17:23) and that you love them as you love me.

1753
02:18:26,383 --> 02:18:29,678
父啊，我在哪里， Father, you have given them to me...

1754
02:18:30,888 --> 02:18:33,807
愿你所赐给我的?也魂我在那里， and I want them to be with me where I am...

1755
02:18:34,141 --> 02:18:38,187
叫他们看见你所赐给我的?耀。 so that they may see my glory,  the glory you gave me...

1756
02:18:39,563 --> 02:18:42,357
因为创立世界以?，你已经爱我了。(17:24) for you loved me  before the world was made.

1757
02:18:43,233 --> 02:18:44,943
公义的父啊， Righteous Father...

1758
02:18:45,819 --> 02:18:48,614
世?未曾?识你，我??识你， the world does not know you,  but I know you...

1759
02:18:48,697 --> 02:18:51,033
这些?也知道你差了我来。(17:25) and these know that you sent me.

1760
02:18:52,576 --> 02:18:56,872
我已将你的名指示他们，还要指示他们， I made you known to them,  and I will continue to do so...

1761
02:18:57,414 --> 02:19:00,918
使你所爱我的爱在他们里面，  in order that the love you have for me  may be in them...

1762
02:19:01,376 --> 02:19:03,796
我也在他们里面。”(17:26) and so that I also may be in them.

1763
02:19:05,923 --> 02:19:08,092
耶稣说了这话， After Jesus had said this prayer...

1764
02:19:09,301 --> 02:19:12,304
就魂门徒出?，过了汲沦溪， he left with his disciples  and went across Kidron Brook.

1765
02:19:19,895 --> 02:19:22,356
在那里有一个园子， There was a garden in that place...

1766
02:19:22,648 --> 02:19:25,192
他和门徒进?了。 (18:1) and Jesus and his disciples went in.

1767
02:19:35,911 --> 02:19:39,540
卖耶稣的漠大也知道那地方， Judas, the traitor, knew where it was...

1768
02:19:40,541 --> 02:19:44,336
因为耶稣和门徒屡次上那里?聚集。(18:2) because many times  Jesus had met there with his disciples.

1769
02:19:45,963 --> 02:19:50,217
漠大领了一队兵 So Judas went to the garden,  taking with him a group of Roman soldiers...

1770
02:19:50,342 --> 02:19:54,388
和祭司长并法利??的差役， and some temple guards  sent by the chief priests and the Pharisees.

1771
02:19:54,638 --> 02:19:57,850
拿着灯笼、火把、兵?，就来到园里。 (18:3) They were armed,  and carried lanterns and torches.

1772
02:20:10,821 --> 02:20:13,949
耶稣知道将要临到自己的一?事， Jesus knew everything  that was going to happen to him...

1773
02:20:14,074 --> 02:20:16,160
就出来对他们说： so he stepped forward and asked them.:

1774
02:20:16,243 --> 02:20:20,581
“你们找谁？” (18:4) 他们回答说：“找拿?勒?耶稣。 -Who is it you are looking for?  -Jesus of Nazareth.

1775
02:20:24,793 --> 02:20:27,421
”耶稣说：“我就是！”卖他的漠大也魂他们站在那里。  Judas, the traitor,  was standing there with them...

1776
02:20:27,504 --> 02:20:29,173
”耶稣说：“我就是！”卖他的漠大也魂他们站在那里。  when Jesus said to them.:

1777
02:20:29,506 --> 02:20:30,716
”耶稣说：“我就是！”卖他的漠大也魂他们站在那里。 (18:5) I am he.

1778
02:20:31,967 --> 02:20:34,428
耶稣一说“我就是”，他们就退后倒在地上。 (18:6) They moved back and fell to the ground.

1779
02:20:44,688 --> 02:20:46,774
他又问他们说： Again Jesus asked them.:

1780
02:20:48,734 --> 02:20:50,986
“你们找谁？” Who is it you are looking for?

1781
02:20:51,820 --> 02:20:54,281
他们说：“找拿?勒?耶稣。” (18:7) Jesus of Nazareth.

1782
02:20:55,991 --> 02:20:58,577
耶稣说：“我已经告诉你们，我就是。 I have already told you that I am he.

1783
02:20:59,953 --> 02:21:02,456
你们?找我， If, then, you are looking for me...

1784
02:21:04,708 --> 02:21:06,460
就?这些??吧！” (18:8) let these others go.

1785
02:21:08,504 --> 02:21:12,216
这要应验耶稣从?的话，说： He said this so that  what he had said might come true.:

1786
02:21:13,050 --> 02:21:17,471
“你所赐给我的?，我没有失落一个。” (18:9) "Father, I have not lost  even one of those you gave me. "

1787
02:21:18,722 --> 02:21:23,227
西门彼得带着一把刀，就拔出来， Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it  and struck the High Priest's slave...

1788
02:21:23,310 --> 02:21:25,020
将大祭司的??砍了一刀，削掉他的右耳， cutting off his right ear.

1789
02:21:27,397 --> 02:21:29,525
那??名叫马勒古。(18:10) The name of the slave was Malchus.

1790
02:21:29,942 --> 02:21:32,361
耶稣就对彼得说：“收刀??吧！ Put your sword back in its place!

1791
02:21:32,444 --> 02:21:37,032
我父所给我的那杯，我?可不喝呢？” (18:11) Do you think that I will not drink the cup  of suffering which my Father has given me?

1792
02:21:40,494 --> 02:21:43,122
那队兵和?夫长并漠太?的差役 Then the Roman soldiers,  with their commanding officer...

1793
02:21:43,205 --> 02:21:45,874
就拿住耶稣， and the Jewish guards arrested Jesus...

1794
02:21:47,251 --> 02:21:48,752
把他捆绑了，(18:12) tied him up...

1795
02:21:53,799 --> 02:21:56,301
先带到亚那面?， and took him first to Annas.

1796
02:21:57,136 --> 02:22:01,140
因为亚那是本年作大祭司该亚法的岳父。(18:13) He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas,  who was High Priest that year.

1797
02:22:01,557 --> 02:22:04,101
这该亚法就是从?向漠太?发议论 It was Caiaphas who had advised  the Jewish authorities...

1798
02:22:04,184 --> 02:22:08,021
说“一个?替百姓死是有益的”那位。 (18:14) that it was better  that one man should die for all the people.

1799
02:22:16,613 --> 02:22:19,741
西门彼得跟着耶稣，还有一个门徒跟着。 Simon Peter and another disciple  followed Jesus.

1800
02:22:21,452 --> 02:22:24,872
那门徒是大祭司所?识的， That other disciple was well known  to the High Priest...

1801
02:22:24,955 --> 02:22:28,751
他就魂耶稣进了大祭司的院子， (18:15) so he went with Jesus into the courtyard  of the High Priest's house...

1802
02:22:28,834 --> 02:22:31,545
彼得?站在门外。 while Peter stayed outside by the gate.

1803
02:22:40,137 --> 02:22:44,475
大祭司所?识的那个门徒出来，和看门的使女说了一声， Then the other disciple went back out,  spoke to the girl at the gate...

1804
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:46,560
就领彼得进?。 (18:16) and brought Peter inside.

1805
02:22:49,396 --> 02:22:52,441
那看门的使女对彼得说：“你不也是这?的门徒吗？” Aren't you also one of the disciples  of that man?

1806
02:22:52,524 --> 02:22:54,902
他说：“我不是。” (18:17) No, I am not.

1807
02:22:57,446 --> 02:23:01,950
??和差役因为天冷，就生了炭火， It was cold, so the servants and guards  had built a charcoal fire...

1808
02:23:02,159 --> 02:23:05,245
站在那里烤火， and were standing around it,  warming themselves.

1809
02:23:05,412 --> 02:23:08,957
彼得也魂他们站着烤火。 (18:18) So Peter went over and stood with them,  warming himself.

1810
02:23:09,958 --> 02:23:14,880
大祭司就以耶稣的门徒和他的教训盘问他。  (18:19) The High Priest questioned Jesus  about his disciples and about his teaching.

1811
02:23:15,172 --> 02:23:16,465
耶稣回答说： Jesus answered.:

1812
02:23:16,548 --> 02:23:19,384
“我从来是明明地对世?说话。 I have always spoken publicly to everyone.

1813
02:23:19,593 --> 02:23:21,011
我常在会堂和殿里， All my teaching was done...

1814
02:23:21,095 --> 02:23:24,848
就是漠太?聚集的地方教训?， in the synagogues and in the Temple,  where all the people come together.

1815
02:23:24,932 --> 02:23:27,518
我在暗地里并没有说什么。  (19:20) I have never said anything in secret.

1816
02:23:28,644 --> 02:23:30,562
你为什么问我呢？ Why, then, do you question me?

1817
02:23:30,771 --> 02:23:34,024
可以问那听见的?，我对他们说的是什么； Question the people who heard me.  Ask them what I told them.

1818
02:23:34,233 --> 02:23:36,110
我所说的，他们都知道。” (19:21) They know what I said.

1819
02:23:38,946 --> 02:23:41,657
耶稣说了这话，旁边站着的一个差役用手掌打他，说：“你这样回答大祭司吗？”(19:22) How dare you talk like that  to the High Priest?

1820
02:23:45,869 --> 02:23:48,205
耶稣说：“我?说得不是， If I have said anything wrong...

1821
02:23:49,206 --> 02:23:51,166
你可以指证那不是； tell everyone here what it was.

1822
02:23:51,875 --> 02:23:54,294
我?说得是， But if I am right in what I have said...

1823
02:23:56,046 --> 02:23:57,714
你为什么打我呢？” (19:23) why do you hit me?

1824
02:24:01,093 --> 02:24:06,056
亚那就把耶稣解到大祭司该亚法那里，?是捆着解?的。 (19:24) Then Annas sent him, still tied up,  to Caiaphas, the High Priest.

1825
02:24:07,891 --> 02:24:11,228
西门彼得正站着烤火， Peter was still standing there,  keeping himself warm.

1826
02:24:11,353 --> 02:24:13,063
有?对他说： So the others said to him.:

1827
02:24:13,188 --> 02:24:15,983
“你不也是他的门徒吗？” "Aren't you also one  of the disciples of that man?"

1828
02:24:16,066 --> 02:24:17,943
彼得不承?，说：“我不是！”  No, I am not.

1829
02:24:19,069 --> 02:24:20,821
彼得不承?，说：“我不是！” (19:25) But Peter denied it.

1830
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:25,075
有大祭司的一个??， One of the High Priest's slaves...

1831
02:24:25,159 --> 02:24:28,871
是彼得削掉耳朵那?的?属，说： a relative of the man  whose ear Peter had cut off, spoke up.

1832
02:24:31,749 --> 02:24:35,043
“我不是看见你魂他在园子里吗？” (19:26) 彼得又不承?。 -Didn't I see you with him in the garden?  -No.

1833
02:24:39,173 --> 02:24:42,092
立时鸡就叫了。 (18:27) And at once, a rooster crowed.

1834
02:24:52,436 --> 02:24:54,021
众?将耶稣从该亚法那里往衙门内解?，那时天还早， Early in the morning...

1835
02:24:54,313 --> 02:24:58,275
众?将耶稣从该亚法那里往衙门内解?，那时天还早， Jesus was taken from Caiaphas' house  to the governor's palace.

1836
02:25:00,944 --> 02:25:03,280
他们自己?不进衙门， The Jewish authorities  did not go inside the palace...

1837
02:25:03,322 --> 02:25:06,575
恐怕?了污秽， for they wanted  to keep themselves ritually clean...

1838
02:25:06,575 --> 02:25:09,578
不能颈逾越节的筵席。  (18:28) in order to be able to eat the Passover meal.

1839
02:25:10,746 --> 02:25:13,540
彼拉多就出来，到他们那里，说： So Pilate went outside to them and asked.:

1840
02:25:14,166 --> 02:25:16,126
“你们告这?是为什么事呢？” (18:29) What do you accuse this man of?

1841
02:25:16,168 --> 02:25:20,422
他们回答说：“这??不是作恶的，我们就不把他交给你。” (18:30) We would not have brought him to you  if he had not committed a crime.

1842
02:25:20,756 --> 02:25:25,177
彼拉多说：“你们自己带他?，按着你们的律法诀问他吧！” Then you yourselves take him  and try him according to your own law.

1843
02:25:25,677 --> 02:25:28,972
漠太?说：“我们没有杀?的?柄。” (18:31) We are not allowed to put anyone to death.

1844
02:25:30,099 --> 02:25:33,894
这要应验耶稣所说 This happened in order to make come true  what Jesus had said...

1845
02:25:34,019 --> 02:25:36,814
自己将要怎样死的话了。 (18:32) when he indicated  the kind of death he would die.

1846
02:25:48,450 --> 02:25:51,620
彼拉多又进了衙门，叫耶稣来，对他说： Pilate went back into the palace  and called Jesus.

1847
02:26:05,843 --> 02:26:08,053
“你是漠太?的王吗？”(18:33)  Are you the King of the Jews?

1848
02:26:08,345 --> 02:26:10,472
耶稣回答说：“这话是你自己说的， Does this question come from you...

1849
02:26:11,723 --> 02:26:13,934
还是别?论我对你说的呢？” (18:34) or have others told you about me?

1850
02:26:15,519 --> 02:26:17,354
彼拉多说：“我?是漠太?呢？ Do you think I am a Jew?

1851
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:22,734
你本国的?和祭司长把你交给我， It was your own people and the chief priests  who handed you over to me.

1852
02:26:24,528 --> 02:26:26,280
你做了什么事呢？” (18:35) What have you done?

1853
02:26:27,823 --> 02:26:30,617
耶稣回答说：“我的国不属这世界。 My kingdom does not belong to this world.

1854
02:26:31,952 --> 02:26:34,329
我的国?属这世界， If my kingdom belonged to this world...

1855
02:26:34,496 --> 02:26:39,334
我的臣?必要争战，使我不至于被交给漠太?； my followers would fight to keep me from  being handed over to the Jewish authorities.

1856
02:26:40,461 --> 02:26:44,298
只是我的国不属这世界。” (18:36) No. My kingdom does not belong here.

1857
02:26:45,507 --> 02:26:49,261
彼拉多就对他说：“这样，你是王吗？”耶稣回答说：“你说我是王， -Are you a king, then?  -You say that I am a king.

1858
02:26:50,929 --> 02:26:54,558
我为此而生，也为此来到世间， I was born and came into the world  for this one purpose...

1859
02:26:54,808 --> 02:26:56,810
特为给真理作见证。 to speak about the truth.

1860
02:26:58,562 --> 02:27:02,316
凡属真理的?就听我的话。” (18:37) Whoever belongs to the truth listens to me.

1861
02:27:05,736 --> 02:27:07,362
  彼拉多说：“真理是什么呢？” And what is truth?

1862
02:27:18,248 --> 02:27:22,377
说了这话，又出来到漠太?那里，对他们说： Then Pilate went back outside  to the people and said to them.:

1863
02:27:23,295 --> 02:27:26,757
“我查不出他有什么罪来，  (18:38) I cannot find any reason  to condemn him. But....

1864
02:27:36,391 --> 02:27:38,227
但你们有个规矩， According to the custom you have...

1865
02:27:38,268 --> 02:27:42,231
在逾越节要我给你们释放一个?， I always set free a prisoner for you  during the Passover!

1866
02:27:44,483 --> 02:27:48,529
你们要我给你们释放漠太?的王吗？” (18:39) Do you want me to set free for you  "the King of the Jews"?

1867
02:27:48,612 --> 02:27:49,571
他们又喊着说：“不要这? No!

1868
02:27:49,655 --> 02:27:51,323
他们又喊着说：“不要这?， They answered him with a shout.:

1869
02:27:51,406 --> 02:27:53,033
要巴拉巴！” Give us Barabbas!

1870
02:27:59,373 --> 02:28:01,417
这巴拉巴是个?盗。  (18:40) Barabbas was a bandit.

1871
02:28:13,262 --> 02:28:16,598
当下彼拉多将耶稣鞭打了。 (19:1) Then Pilate took Jesus  and had him whipped.

1872
02:28:18,809 --> 02:28:21,854
兵丁用荆棘编作冠冕 The soldiers made a crown  out of thorny branches...

1873
02:28:21,937 --> 02:28:23,564
戴在他头上， and put it on his head.

1874
02:28:24,648 --> 02:28:28,402
给他穿上紫袍， (19:2) Then they put a purple robe on him  and came to him and said:

1875
02:28:28,694 --> 02:28:31,405
又挨近他说：“恭喜漠太?的王啊！” "Long live the King of the Jews!"

1876
02:28:32,698 --> 02:28:34,825
他们就用手掌打他。 (19:3) And they went up and slapped him.

1877
02:28:40,789 --> 02:28:44,168
彼拉多又出来对众?说： Pilate went back out once more  and said to the crowd.:

1878
02:28:50,174 --> 02:28:53,844
“我带他出来见你们， Look, I will bring him out here to you...

1879
02:28:54,845 --> 02:28:59,600
叫你们知道我查不出他有什么罪来。” (19:4) to let you see that I cannot find  any reason to condemn him.

1880
02:29:01,810 --> 02:29:05,230
耶稣出来，戴着荆棘冠冕，穿着紫袍。彼拉多对他们说：“你们看这个?！” Look, here is the man.

1881
02:29:07,399 --> 02:29:08,942
耶稣出来，戴着荆棘冠冕，穿着紫袍。彼拉多对他们说：“你们看这个?！” So Jesus came out...

1882
02:29:09,193 --> 02:29:12,321
耶稣出来，戴着荆棘冠冕，穿着紫袍。彼拉多对他们说：“你们看这个?！” (19:5) wearing the crown of thorns  and the purple robe.

1883
02:29:14,615 --> 02:29:15,991
祭司长和差役看见他，就喊着说：“钉他十字架！钉他十字架！” Crucify him!

1884
02:29:42,392 --> 02:29:45,813
彼拉多说：“你们自己把他钉十字架吧！ You take him, then, and crucify him.

1885
02:29:48,065 --> 02:29:50,359
我查不出他有什么罪来。” (19:6) I find no reason to condemn him.

1886
02:29:52,111 --> 02:29:54,822
漠太?回答说：“我们有律法，按那律法，他是该死的！ We have a law that says he ought to die...

1887
02:29:55,072 --> 02:29:57,866
因他以自己为　神的儿子。” (19:7) because he claimed to be the Son of God!

1888
02:30:08,669 --> 02:30:12,172
彼拉多听见这话，越发害怕。 (19:8) When Pilate heard this,  he was even more afraid.

1889
02:30:22,850 --> 02:30:26,562
又进衙门，对耶稣说： He went back into the palace  and asked Jesus.:

1890
02:30:27,187 --> 02:30:29,106
“你是哪里来的？” Where do you come from?

1891
02:30:30,274 --> 02:30:32,276
耶稣?不回答。 (19:9) But Jesus did not answer.

1892
02:30:33,444 --> 02:30:35,404
彼拉多说：“你不对我说话吗？ You will not speak to me?

1893
02:30:36,321 --> 02:30:40,784
你?不知我有?柄释放你， Remember, I have the authority  to set you free...

1894
02:30:42,578 --> 02:30:46,498
也有?柄把你钉十字架吗？” (19:10) and also to have you crucified.

1895
02:30:49,376 --> 02:30:51,587
耶稣回答说：“?不是从上头赐给你的， You have authority over me...

1896
02:30:52,463 --> 02:30:55,174
你就毫无?柄办我， only because it was given to you by God.

1897
02:30:58,761 --> 02:31:01,430
所以把我交给你的那?， So the man who handed me over to you...

1898
02:31:02,639 --> 02:31:04,641
罪更重了。” (19:11) is guilty of a worse sin.

1899
02:31:07,144 --> 02:31:11,857
从此彼拉多想要释放耶稣，无奈漠太?喊着说： When Pilate heard this,  he tried to find a way to set Jesus free.

1900
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:20,324
“你?释放这个?，就不是凯?的忠臣（注：原文作“朋友”）。 If you set him free,  that means you are not the Emperor's friend.

1901
02:31:26,580 --> 02:31:30,626
凡以自己为王的，就是背叛凯?了。” (19:12) Anyone who claims to be a king  is a rebel against the Emperor.

1902
02:31:51,980 --> 02:31:55,943
彼拉多听见这话，就带耶稣出来， When Pilate heard these words,  he took Jesus outside...

1903
02:31:56,735 --> 02:32:00,989
到了一个地方，名叫?华石处， and sat down on the judge's seat  in the place called "The Stone Pavement. "

1904
02:32:01,115 --> 02:32:03,534
希伯来话叫厄巴大，就在那里坐堂。 (19:13) In Hebrew, the name is Gabbatha.

1905
02:32:39,403 --> 02:32:42,823
那?是预备逾越节的?子。约有午正， It was then almost noon  of the day before the Passover.

1906
02:32:43,449 --> 02:32:45,200
彼拉多对漠太?说： Pilate said to the people.:

1907
02:32:45,284 --> 02:32:46,952
“看哪，这是你们的王！” (19:14) Here is your king.

1908
02:32:50,664 --> 02:32:52,833
他们喊着说：“除掉他！除掉他！ Kill him!

1909
02:32:58,630 --> 02:33:00,048
钉他在十字架上！” Crucify him!

1910
02:33:14,605 --> 02:33:17,065
彼拉多说：“我可以把你们的王钉十字架吗？” Do you want me to crucify your king?

1911
02:33:17,691 --> 02:33:20,736
祭司长回答说：“除了凯?，我们没有王！” (19:15) The only king we have is the Emperor.

1912
02:33:22,780 --> 02:33:27,034
于是，彼拉多将耶稣交给他们?钉十字架。 (19:16) Then Pilate handed Jesus over to them  to be crucified.

1913
02:34:06,824 --> 02:34:11,537
他们就把耶稣带了?。耶稣背着自己的十字架出来， So they took charge of Jesus.  He went out, carrying his cross...

1914
02:34:12,204 --> 02:34:15,833
到了一个地方，名叫髑髅地， and came to "The Place of the Skull, "  as it is called.

1915
02:34:15,874 --> 02:34:18,669
希伯来话叫各各他。(19:17) In Hebrew, it is called Golgotha.

1916
02:34:23,841 --> 02:34:28,262
他们就在那里钉他在十字架上， There they crucified him.  And they also crucified two other men...

1917
02:34:28,345 --> 02:34:31,515
还有两个?和他一魂钉着，一边一个，耶稣在中间。 (19:18) one on each side, with Jesus between them.

1918
02:34:43,527 --> 02:34:47,072
彼拉多又用牌子写了一个名号，安在十字架上， Pilate wrote a notice  and had it put on the cross.:

1919
02:34:49,199 --> 02:34:53,746
写的是：“漠太?的王，拿?勒?耶稣。” (19:19) "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews"  is what he wrote.

1920
02:35:17,895 --> 02:35:19,772
有许多漠太?念这名号， Many people read it...

1921
02:35:19,897 --> 02:35:21,982
因为耶稣被钉十字架的地方， because the place  where Jesus was crucified...

1922
02:35:22,065 --> 02:35:24,067
与城相近， was not far from the city.

1923
02:35:27,613 --> 02:35:31,283
并?是用希伯来、罗马、希腊?样文字写的。 (19:20) The notice was written  in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.

1924
02:35:35,579 --> 02:35:37,790
漠太?的祭司长就对彼拉多说： The Chief Priest said to Pilate:

1925
02:35:37,873 --> 02:35:41,293
“不要写‘漠太?的王’， "Do not write 'The King of the Jews, '  but rather:

1926
02:35:41,585 --> 02:35:45,214
要写‘他自己说我是漠太?的王’。” (19:21) "This man said, 'I am King of the Jews."'

1927
02:35:48,008 --> 02:35:50,427
彼拉多说：“我所写的，我已经写上了。” (19:22) What I have written stays written.

1928
02:35:59,019 --> 02:36:02,106
兵丁既?将耶稣钉在十字架上，就拿他的衣服 After the soldiers had crucified Jesus,  they took his clothes...

1929
02:36:02,189 --> 02:36:06,401
分为四份，每兵一份； and divided them into four parts,  one part for each soldier.

1930
02:36:09,947 --> 02:36:11,281
又拿他的里衣， They also took the robe...

1931
02:36:11,448 --> 02:36:15,577
这件里衣原来没有缝儿，是上下一?织成的。 (19:23) which was made of one piece  of woven cloth without any seams in it.

1932
02:36:15,911 --> 02:36:17,663
他们就彼此说： The soldiers said to one another.:

1933
02:36:17,746 --> 02:36:21,542
“我们不要撕开，只要拈阄，看谁得着。” "Let's not tear it,  let's throw dice to see who will get it. "

1934
02:36:21,708 --> 02:36:24,878
这要应验经上的话说： This happened in order  to make the scripture come true.:

1935
02:36:24,962 --> 02:36:29,091
“他们分了我的外衣，为我的里衣拈阄。” "They divided my clothes among themselves  and gambled for my robe. "

1936
02:36:30,050 --> 02:36:32,469
兵丁果?做了这事。 (19:24) And this is what the soldiers did.

1937
02:36:33,095 --> 02:36:36,181
站在耶稣十字架旁边的，有他母? Standing close to Jesus' cross  were his mother...

1938
02:36:36,265 --> 02:36:39,351
与他母?的姊妹，并革罗罢的?子马利亚和 his mother's sister, Mary,  the wife of Clopas...

1939
02:36:41,103 --> 02:36:42,813
抹大拉的马利亚。 (19:25) and Mary Magdalene.

1940
02:36:44,481 --> 02:36:48,110
耶稣见母?和他所爱的那门徒 Jesus saw his mother  and the disciple he loved...

1941
02:36:48,735 --> 02:36:50,237
站在旁边， standing there.

1942
02:36:51,321 --> 02:36:52,823
就对他母?说：“母?（注：原文作“妇?”），看，你的儿子！”(19:26) He is your son.

1943
02:36:57,077 --> 02:36:58,954
又对那门徒说： Then he said to the disciple.:

1944
02:36:59,288 --> 02:37:00,748
“看，你的母?！” She is your mother.

1945
02:37:01,999 --> 02:37:05,627
从此那门徒就接她到自己家里?了。 (19:27) From that time,  the disciple took her to live in his home.

1946
02:37:08,839 --> 02:37:12,384
这事以后，耶稣知道各样的事已经成了， Jesus knew that by now  everything had been completed...

1947
02:37:13,677 --> 02:37:17,139
为要使经上的话应验，就说： and in order to make  the Scripture come true, he said.:

1948
02:37:27,149 --> 02:37:28,692
“我渴了。” (19:28) I am thirsty.

1949
02:37:32,696 --> 02:37:35,824
有一个?皿盛满了醋，放在那里， A bowl was there, full of cheap wine...

1950
02:37:36,700 --> 02:37:40,996
他们就拿海?蘸满了醋，绑在牛膝草上， so a sponge was soaked in the wine,  put on a stalk of hyssop...

1951
02:37:41,205 --> 02:37:43,248
送到他口。 (19:29) and lifted up to his lips.

1952
02:37:49,213 --> 02:37:51,006
耶稣尝（注：原文作“受”）了那醋，就说： Jesus drank the wine.

1953
02:38:02,392 --> 02:38:03,894
“成了！”， It is finished.

1954
02:38:05,938 --> 02:38:09,858
便低下头，将灵魂交付　神了。 (19:30) Then he bowed his head  and gave up his spirit.

1955
02:38:19,910 --> 02:38:21,954
漠太?因这?是预备?，又因那安息?是个大?， Then the Jewish authorities asked Pilate...

1956
02:38:22,037 --> 02:38:25,499
就?彼拉多叫?打断他们的腿， to allow them to break the legs  of the men who had been crucified...

1957
02:38:25,582 --> 02:38:28,544
把他们拿?， and to take the bodies down  from the crosses.

1958
02:38:32,423 --> 02:38:35,342
免得尸首当安息? They requested this because it was Friday...

1959
02:38:35,592 --> 02:38:39,388
免得尸首当安息? and they did not want the bodies  to stay on the crosses on the Sabbath...

1960
02:38:39,430 --> 02:38:42,391
留在十字架上。 (19:31) since the coming Sabbath  was especially holy.

1961
02:38:42,850 --> 02:38:45,936
于是兵丁来，把头一个?的腿， So the soldiers went and broke the legs  of the first man...

1962
02:38:46,019 --> 02:38:49,731
并与耶稣魂钉第二个?的腿都打断了。 (19:32) and then of the other man  who had been crucified with Jesus.

1963
02:38:53,610 --> 02:38:57,489
只是来到耶稣那里，见他已经死了， But when they came to Jesus,  they saw that he was already dead...

1964
02:38:57,656 --> 02:38:59,950
就不打断他的腿。 (19:33) so they did not break his legs.

1965
02:39:00,033 --> 02:39:04,163
惟有一个兵拿?扎他的肋旁， One of the soldiers, however,  plunged his spear into Jesus' side...

1966
02:39:12,671 --> 02:39:14,590
随即有血 And at once blood...

1967
02:39:15,299 --> 02:39:17,634
和水流出来。(19:34) and water poured out.

1968
02:39:22,681 --> 02:39:25,434
看见这事的那? The one who saw this happen  has spoken of it...

1969
02:39:25,476 --> 02:39:27,686
就作见证， so that you may also believe.

1970
02:39:29,772 --> 02:39:34,234
他的见证也是真的，并?他知道自己所说的是真的，叫你们也可以信。 (19:35) What he said is true,  and he knows that he speaks the truth.

1971
02:39:36,320 --> 02:39:39,281
这些事成了，为要应验经上的话说： This was done  to make the Scripture come true:

1972
02:39:39,740 --> 02:39:42,576
“他的骨头一根也不可折断。” (19:36) "Not one of his bones will be broken. "

1973
02:39:46,413 --> 02:39:48,832
经上又有一句说： And there is another scripture that says:

1974
02:39:48,916 --> 02:39:51,960
“他们要仰望自己所扎的?。” (19:37) "People will look at him,  whom they pierced. "

1975
02:40:01,804 --> 02:40:05,474
这些事以后，有亚利马太?约瑟， After this, Joseph,  who was from the town of Arimathea...

1976
02:40:06,016 --> 02:40:09,103
是耶稣的门徒，只因怕漠太?，就暗暗地作门徒。他来?彼拉多，要把耶稣的身伐领?。 asked Pilate if he could take Jesus' body.

1977
02:40:09,353 --> 02:40:11,980
是耶稣的门徒，只因怕漠太?，就暗暗地作门徒。他来?彼拉多，要把耶稣的身伐领?。 Joseph was a follower of Jesus,  but in secret...

1978
02:40:12,064 --> 02:40:14,900
是耶稣的门徒，只因怕漠太?，就暗暗地作门徒。他来?彼拉多，要把耶稣的身伐领?。 because he was afraid  of the Jewish authorities...

1979
02:40:15,734 --> 02:40:17,903
彼拉多允准， Pilate told him he could have the body...

1980
02:40:17,986 --> 02:40:20,739
他就把耶稣的身伐领?了。 (19:38) so Joseph went and took it away.

1981
02:40:22,241 --> 02:40:25,702
又有尼哥德慕，就是先?夜里?见耶稣的， Nicodemus, who at first had gone  to see Jesus at night...

1982
02:40:26,036 --> 02:40:27,538
带着没药和沉香约有一百斤?来。 went with Joseph...

1983
02:40:27,788 --> 02:40:30,416
带着没药和沉香约有一百斤?来。 taking with him  about 100 pounds of spices...

1984
02:40:30,499 --> 02:40:32,835
带着没药和沉香约有一百斤?来。(19:39) a mixture of myrrh and aloe.

1985
02:40:36,213 --> 02:40:39,967
他们就照漠太?殡葬的规矩，把耶稣的身伐用细麻布加上香料裹好了。 The two men took Jesus' body  and wrapped it in linen cloths...

1986
02:40:40,050 --> 02:40:41,260
他们就照漠太?殡葬的规矩，把耶稣的身伐用细麻布加上香料裹好了。 with the spices...

1987
02:40:41,343 --> 02:40:45,013
他们就照漠太?殡葬的规矩，把耶稣的身伐用细麻布加上香料裹好了。 (19:40) according to the Jewish custom  of preparing a body for burial.

1988
02:40:47,099 --> 02:40:50,644
  在耶稣钉十字架的地方有一个园子， There was a garden in the place  where Jesus had been put to death...

1989
02:40:50,727 --> 02:40:54,857
园子里有一座新坟墓，是从来没有葬过?的。  (19:41) and in it there was a new tomb,  where no one had ever been buried.

1990
02:40:56,358 --> 02:40:58,569
只因是漠太?的预备?， Since it was the day before the Sabbath...

1991
02:40:58,652 --> 02:41:00,863
又因那坟墓近， and because the tomb was close by...

1992
02:41:00,946 --> 02:41:03,198
他们就把耶稣安放在那里。(19:42) they placed Jesus' body there.

1993
02:41:04,324 --> 02:41:07,453
??的第一??早，天还黑的时候， Early on Sunday morning,  while it was still dark...

1994
02:41:07,828 --> 02:41:09,913
抹大拉的马利亚来到坟墓那里， Mary Magdalene went to the tomb...

1995
02:41:11,331 --> 02:41:14,710
看见石头从坟墓挪开了， (20:1) and saw that the stone  had been taken away from the entrance.

1996
02:41:18,797 --> 02:41:23,051
就跑来见西门彼得和耶稣所爱的那个门徒，对他们说： She went running to Simon Peter  and the other disciple, whom Jesus loved.

1997
02:41:29,683 --> 02:41:34,188
“有?把主从坟墓里挪了?，我们不知道放在哪ǎ　 (20:2) They have taken the Lord from the tomb,  and we don't know where they have put him.

1998
02:41:36,106 --> 02:41:39,401
彼得和那门徒就出来，往坟墓那里?。 (20:3) Then Peter and the other disciple  went to the tomb.

1999
02:41:40,778 --> 02:41:42,488
两个?魂跑， The two of them were running...

2000
02:41:42,571 --> 02:41:46,950
那门徒比彼得跑得更快，先到了坟墓， (20:4) but the other disciple ran faster than Peter  and reached the tomb first.

2001
02:41:48,994 --> 02:41:51,663
低头往里看，就见细麻布还放在那ǎ He bent over and saw the linen cloths...

2002
02:41:52,456 --> 02:41:54,249
只是没有进?。 (20:5) but he did not go in.

2003
02:41:55,209 --> 02:41:57,419
西门彼得随后也到了， Behind him came Simon Peter...

2004
02:41:58,378 --> 02:42:00,672
进坟墓里?， and he went straight into the tomb.

2005
02:42:05,427 --> 02:42:07,721
就看见细麻布还放在那ǎ (20:6) He saw the linen cloths lying there...

2006
02:42:07,805 --> 02:42:10,516
又看见耶稣的裹头巾 and the cloth  which had been around Jesus' head.

2007
02:42:10,599 --> 02:42:14,561
没有和细麻布放在一处，是另在一处卷着。 (20:7) It was not lying with the linen cloths,  but was rolled up by itself.

2008
02:42:16,146 --> 02:42:20,400
先到坟墓的那门徒也进?， Then the other disciple,  who had reached the tomb first also went in.

2009
02:42:21,235 --> 02:42:23,779
看见就信了。(20:8) He saw and believed.

2010
02:42:26,949 --> 02:42:31,662
因为他们还不明白圣经的意思，就是耶稣必要从死里复活。(20:9) They still did not understand the Scripture  which said he must rise from death.

2011
02:42:35,624 --> 02:42:38,043
于是两个门徒回自己的住处?了。 (20:10) Then the disciples went back home.

2012
02:42:39,211 --> 02:42:41,964
马利亚?站在坟墓外面哭， Mary stood crying outside the tomb.

2013
02:42:45,175 --> 02:42:49,012
哭的时候，低头往坟墓里看，(20:11) While she was still crying,  she bent over and looked in the tomb...

2014
02:42:58,772 --> 02:43:02,484
就见两个天使，穿着白衣， and saw two angels there dressed in white...

2015
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:05,237
在安放耶稣身伐的地方坐着， sitting where the body of Jesus had been...

2016
02:43:05,320 --> 02:43:07,990
一个在头，一个在脚。 (20:12) one at the head, the other at the feet.

2017
02:43:09,908 --> 02:43:12,953
天使对她说：“妇?，你为什么哭？” "Woman, why are you crying?"  they asked her.

2018
02:43:13,829 --> 02:43:16,123
她说：“因为有?把我主挪了?，　  They have taken my Lord away...

2019
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:19,877
我不知道放在哪里。”(20:13) and I do not know where they have put him.

2020
02:43:23,714 --> 02:43:27,551
说了这话，就转过身来，看见耶稣站在那里， Then she turned around  and saw Jesus standing there...

2021
02:43:28,719 --> 02:43:30,804
?不知道是耶稣。 (20:14) but she did not know that it was Jesus.

2022
02:43:30,888 --> 02:43:32,890
耶稣问她说：“妇?，为什么哭？ Woman, why are you crying?

2023
02:43:33,974 --> 02:43:36,185
你找谁呢？” Who is it that you are looking for?

2024
02:43:36,226 --> 02:43:39,229
马利亚以为是看园的，就对他说： She thought he was the gardener,  so she said to him.:

2025
02:43:39,313 --> 02:43:41,315
“先生，?是你把他移了?， If you took him away, sir...

2026
02:43:41,398 --> 02:43:44,651
?告诉我你把他放在哪里，我便??他。” (20:15) tell me where you have put him,  and I will go and get him.

2027
02:43:50,407 --> 02:43:51,492
耶稣说：“马利亚！”  Mary.

2028
02:43:52,034 --> 02:43:54,411
马利亚就转过来，用希伯来话对他说： She turned toward him and said in Hebrew.:

2029
02:43:54,578 --> 02:43:55,788
“拉波尼 Rabboni!

2030
02:43:55,871 --> 02:43:57,164
（拉波尼就是夫子的意思）！”(20:16) This means "Teacher. "

2031
02:43:57,247 --> 02:43:58,874
耶稣说：“不要摸我， Do not hold on to me...

2032
02:44:00,918 --> 02:44:04,129
因我还没有升上?见我的父。 because I have not yet gone  back up to the Father.

2033
02:44:05,214 --> 02:44:09,843
你往我弟兄那里?，告诉他们说：我要升上?见我的父， But go to my brothers and tell them  I am returning to Him who is my Father...

2034
02:44:09,927 --> 02:44:11,386
也是你们的父； and their Father...

2035
02:44:12,262 --> 02:44:14,056
见我的　神，也是你们的　神。” (20:17) my God and their God.

2036
02:44:18,685 --> 02:44:22,731
抹大拉的马利亚就?告诉门徒说：“我已经看见了主！” So Mary Magdalene went and told  the disciples that she had seen the Lord...

2037
02:44:22,815 --> 02:44:25,609
她又将主对她说的这话告诉他们。 (20:18) and related to them what he had told her.

2038
02:44:27,778 --> 02:44:29,446
那?（就是??的第一?）晚上，门徒所在的地方， It was late that Sunday evening...

2039
02:44:29,530 --> 02:44:32,991
因怕漠太?， and the disciples were gathered together  behind locked doors...

2040
02:44:33,117 --> 02:44:35,994
门都关了。 because they were afraid  of the Jewish authorities.

2041
02:44:36,662 --> 02:44:39,706
耶稣来站在当中， Then Jesus came and stood among them.

2042
02:44:40,666 --> 02:44:42,334
对他们说：“愿你们?安！” (20:19) Peace be with you.

2043
02:44:42,751 --> 02:44:46,380
说了这话，就把手和肋旁指给他们看。 After saying this,  he showed them his hands and his side.

2044
02:44:53,720 --> 02:44:57,141
门徒看见主，就喜乐了。 (20:20) The disciples were filled with joy  at seeing the Lord.

2045
02:44:58,642 --> 02:45:00,602
耶稣又对他们说： Jesus said to them again.:

2046
02:45:00,811 --> 02:45:02,479
“愿你们?安！ Peace be with you.

2047
02:45:03,355 --> 02:45:05,941
父怎样差?了我，我也照样差?你们。”(20:21) As the Father sent me, so I send you.

2048
02:45:14,700 --> 02:45:16,702
说了这话，就向他们吹一口?，说： Then he breathed on them.

2049
02:45:28,005 --> 02:45:30,007
“你们受圣灵。 (20:22) Receive the Holy Spirit.

2050
02:45:31,049 --> 02:45:34,511
你们b免谁的罪，谁的罪就b免了； If you forgive people's sins,  they are forgiven.

2051
02:45:37,014 --> 02:45:39,224
你们留下谁的罪， If you do not forgive them...

2052
02:45:41,518 --> 02:45:43,103
谁的罪就留下了。” (20:23) they are not forgiven.

2053
02:45:59,036 --> 02:46:02,915
那十二个门徒中，有称为低土马的多马， One of the twelve disciples, Thomas,  called the Twin...

2054
02:46:02,998 --> 02:46:05,417
耶稣来的时候，他没有和他们魂在。 (20:24) was not with them when Jesus came.

2055
02:46:08,378 --> 02:46:12,508
那些门徒就对他说：“我们已经看见主了。” So the other disciples told him,  "We have seen the Lord. "

2056
02:46:13,801 --> 02:46:17,054
多马?说：“我憧醇他手上的钉痕， Unless I see the scars of the nails  in his hands...

2057
02:46:17,679 --> 02:46:21,892
用指头探?那钉痕，又用手探?他的肋旁， and put my finger on those scars,  and my hand in his side...

2058
02:46:23,477 --> 02:46:25,187
我总不信。”(20:25)  I will not believe.

2059
02:46:33,028 --> 02:46:36,657
过了八?，门徒又在屋里， A week later,  the disciples were together again indoors...

2060
02:46:36,907 --> 02:46:38,575
多马也和他们魂在。 and Thomas was with them.

2061
02:46:39,535 --> 02:46:44,123
门都关了。耶稣来站在当中说： The doors were locked,  but Jesus came and stood among them.

2062
02:46:49,169 --> 02:46:53,424
“愿你们?安！” (20:26) 就对多马说：“伸过你的指头来，摸（注：“摸”原文作“看”）我的手； Peace be with you.  Put your finger here, and look at my hands.

2063
02:46:58,178 --> 02:47:00,848
伸出你的手来，探?我的肋旁。 Then reach out your hand  and put it in my side.

2064
02:47:04,226 --> 02:47:06,353
不要疑惑，总要信！” (20:27) Stop your doubting and believe.

2065
02:47:06,895 --> 02:47:11,066
多马说：“我的主，我的　神！” (20:28) My Lord, and my God.

2066
02:47:18,282 --> 02:47:22,077
  耶稣对他说：“你因看见了我才信， Do you believe because you see me?

2067
02:47:24,288 --> 02:47:27,458
那没有看见就信的有福了！” (20:29)  How happy are those  who believe without seeing me.

2068
02:47:32,463 --> 02:47:36,341
耶稣在门徒面?另外行了许多神?， In his disciples' presence,  Jesus performed many other miracles...

2069
02:47:36,425 --> 02:47:38,802
没有记在这书上。　(20:30) which are not written down in this book.

2070
02:47:39,094 --> 02:47:40,971
  但记这些事， But these have been written...

2071
02:47:41,472 --> 02:47:45,100
要叫你们信耶稣是基督， in order that you may believe  that Jesus is the Messiah...

2072
02:47:45,642 --> 02:47:47,269
是　神的儿子， the Son of God...

2073
02:47:47,478 --> 02:47:50,856
并?叫你们信了他，就可以因他的名得生命。  (20:31) and that through your faith in him,  you may have life.

2074
02:47:52,191 --> 02:47:56,236
这些事以后， After this, Jesus appeared once more  to his disciples...

2075
02:47:56,320 --> 02:47:57,946
耶稣在提比哩亚海边又向门徒显现。 at Lake Tiberias.

2076
02:47:58,030 --> 02:47:59,740
他怎样显现记在下面： (21:1) This is how it happened.:

2077
02:48:00,365 --> 02:48:03,619
有西门彼得和称为低土马的多马， Simon Peter, Thomas, called the Twin...

2078
02:48:03,952 --> 02:48:07,956
并加利利的迦拿?拿但业，还有西庇太的两个儿子， Nathanael, the one from Cana in Galilee,  the sons of Zebedee...

2079
02:48:08,290 --> 02:48:11,502
又有两个门徒，都在一处。 (21:2) and two other disciples of Jesus  were all together.

2080
02:48:12,211 --> 02:48:14,505
西门彼得对他们说：“我打话?。” Simon Peter said to the others.:

2081
02:48:14,630 --> 02:48:16,882
他们说：“我们也和你魂?。” -I am going fishing.  -We will come with you.

2082
02:48:16,965 --> 02:48:19,635
他们说：“我们也和你魂?。” "We will come with you, " they told him.

2083
02:48:23,972 --> 02:48:28,811
他们就出?，上了船，那一夜并没有打着什么。(21:3) So they went out in a boat,  but all that night they did not catch a thing.

2084
02:48:37,403 --> 02:48:41,156
天将亮的时候，耶稣站在岸上， As the sun was rising,  Jesus stood at the water's edge...

2085
02:48:41,865 --> 02:48:44,952
门徒?不知道是耶稣。 (21:4) but the disciples did not know  that it was Jesus.

2086
02:48:45,035 --> 02:48:47,871
耶稣就对他们说：“小子！你们有颈的没有？” Young men, haven't you caught anything?

2087
02:48:48,288 --> 02:48:49,665
他们回答说：“没有！” (21:5) Not a thing!

2088
02:48:50,165 --> 02:48:54,503
耶稣说：“你们把网?在船的右边，就必得着。” Throw your net out on the right side  of the boat, and you will catch some.

2089
02:49:03,178 --> 02:49:05,013
他们便?下网?， So they threw the net out...

2090
02:49:09,059 --> 02:49:11,353
竟拉不上来了， and could not pull it back in...

2091
02:49:14,565 --> 02:49:16,859
因为话甚多。(21:6) because they had caught so many fish.

2092
02:49:27,745 --> 02:49:30,622
耶稣所爱的那门徒对彼得说： The disciple whom Jesus loved  said to Peter.:

2093
02:49:30,956 --> 02:49:32,249
“是主！” It is the Lord.

2094
02:49:38,756 --> 02:49:41,341
那时西门彼得赤着身子，一听见是主， When Peter heard that it was the Lord...

2095
02:49:41,425 --> 02:49:45,179
就束上一件外衣， he wrapped his outer garment around him,  for he had taken his clothes off...

2096
02:49:45,262 --> 02:49:47,139
跳在海里。 (21:7) and jumped into the water.

2097
02:49:47,222 --> 02:49:51,769
?余的门徒离岸不远，约有二百肘（注：古代以肘为尺，一肘约有今时尺半）， The other disciples came to shore  in the boat, pulling the net full of fish.

2098
02:49:52,060 --> 02:49:55,147
就在小船上把那网话拉过来。 (21:8) They were not very far from land,  about a hundred yards away.

2099
02:49:55,230 --> 02:49:56,640
他们上了岸， When they stepped ashore...

2100
02:49:56,774 --> 02:50:00,569
就看见那里有炭火，上面有话，又有饼。 (21:9) they saw a charcoal fire there  with fish on it and some bread.

2101
02:50:11,705 --> 02:50:14,249
耶稣对他们说：“把刚才打的话拿几条来。” (21:10) Bring some of the fish you have just caught.

2102
02:50:14,583 --> 02:50:18,504
西门彼得就?（注：或作“上船”），把网拉到岸上， Simon Peter went aboard  and dragged the net ashore full of big fish...

2103
02:50:18,587 --> 02:50:20,547
那网满了大话，共一百五十?条。 153 in all.

2104
02:50:20,964 --> 02:50:25,094
话虽这样多，网?没有?。(21:11) Even though there were so many,  still the net did not tear.

2105
02:50:25,844 --> 02:50:28,263
耶稣说：“你们来颈早饭。” Come, and eat.

2106
02:50:28,347 --> 02:50:31,600
门徒中没有一个敢问他：“你是谁？”， None of the disciples dared ask him,  "Who are you?"

2107
02:50:31,975 --> 02:50:34,436
因为知道是主。 (21:12) Because they knew it was the Lord.

2108
02:50:34,937 --> 02:50:38,899
耶稣就来拿饼和话 So Jesus went over, took the bread,  and gave it to them...

2109
02:50:39,316 --> 02:50:41,276
给他们。 (21:13) he did the same with the fish.

2110
02:50:41,443 --> 02:50:45,572
耶稣从死里复活以后向门徒显现， This, then, was the third time  Jesus appeared to his disciples...

2111
02:50:45,697 --> 02:50:47,991
这是第?次。 (21:14) after he was raised from death.

2112
02:50:49,368 --> 02:50:53,122
他们颈完了早饭，耶稣对西门彼得说： After they had eaten,  Jesus said to Simon Peter.:

2113
02:50:53,330 --> 02:50:55,124
“约翰的儿子西门（注：“约翰”在马太16章17节称“约拿”）， Simon, son of John...

2114
02:50:56,667 --> 02:50:59,128
你爱我比这些更深吗？” do you love me more than these others do?

2115
02:51:03,465 --> 02:51:06,301
彼得说：“主啊，是的，你知道我爱你。” Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.

2116
02:51:07,344 --> 02:51:09,179
耶稣对他说：“你喂养我的小羊。” (21:15) Take care of my lambs.

2117
02:51:13,517 --> 02:51:15,811
耶稣第二次又对他说： A second time Jesus said to him.:

2118
02:51:16,353 --> 02:51:19,815
“约翰的儿子西门，你爱我吗？” Simon, son of John, do you love me?

2119
02:51:21,692 --> 02:51:25,446
彼得说：“主啊，是的，你知道我爱你。” Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.

2120
02:51:29,867 --> 02:51:31,702
耶稣说：“你灵养我的羊。” (21:16) Take care of my sheep.

2121
02:51:35,205 --> 02:51:37,666
第?次对他说： A third time, Jesus said.:

2122
02:51:38,834 --> 02:51:40,335
“约翰的儿子西门， Simon, son of John...

2123
02:51:43,213 --> 02:51:44,715
你爱我吗？” do you love me?

2124
02:51:51,221 --> 02:51:53,056
彼得因为耶稣第?次对他说：“你爱我吗”，就忧愁， Peter became sad...

2125
02:51:53,140 --> 02:51:55,768
彼得因为耶稣第?次对他说：“你爱我吗”，就忧愁， because Jesus asked him the third time.:

2126
02:51:55,851 --> 02:51:57,436
彼得因为耶稣第?次对他说：“你爱我吗”，就忧愁， "Do you love me?"

2127
02:51:58,061 --> 02:51:59,813
对耶稣说： And so he said to him.:

2128
02:51:59,938 --> 02:52:01,148
“主啊， Lord...

2129
02:52:05,486 --> 02:52:07,237
你是无所不知的， you know everything.

2130
02:52:11,408 --> 02:52:13,368
你知道我爱你。” You know that I love you.

2131
02:52:20,501 --> 02:52:22,377
耶稣说：“你喂养我的羊。 (21:17) Take care of my sheep.

2132
02:52:29,259 --> 02:52:31,053
我实实在在地告诉你： I am telling you the truth.

2133
02:52:33,097 --> 02:52:34,932
你年少的时候， When you were young...

2134
02:52:35,265 --> 02:52:38,560
自己束上带子，随意往来； you used to get ready  and go anywhere you wanted to.

2135
02:52:40,479 --> 02:52:44,650
但年老的时候，你要伸出手来， But when you are old,  you will stretch out your hands...

2136
02:52:46,110 --> 02:52:50,864
别?要把你束上，带你到不愿意?的地方。” (21:18) and someone else will tie you up  and take you where you don't want to go.

2137
02:52:52,950 --> 02:52:57,788
耶稣说这话，是指着彼得要怎样死， In saying this, Jesus was indicating  the way in which Peter would die...

2138
02:52:57,996 --> 02:52:59,915
?耀　神。 and bring glory to God.

2139
02:53:00,916 --> 02:53:02,543
说了这话，就对他说： Then Jesus said to him:

2140
02:53:02,751 --> 02:53:03,752
“你跟从我吧！” (21:19) Follow me.

2141
02:53:03,836 --> 02:53:07,798
彼得转过来，看见耶稣所爱的那门徒跟着， Peter turned around and saw behind him  that other disciple whom Jesus loved...

2142
02:53:07,881 --> 02:53:10,968
就是在晚饭的时候，靠着耶稣胸膛说 the one who had leaned close to Jesus  at the meal and had asked.:

2143
02:53:11,051 --> 02:53:14,763
“主啊，卖你的是谁”的那门徒。　 (21:20) 彼得看见他，就问耶稣说： "Lord, who is going to betray you?"  When Peter saw him, he asked.:

2144
02:53:14,805 --> 02:53:17,099
“主啊，这?将来?何？” (21:21) Lord, what about this man?

2145
02:53:22,896 --> 02:53:27,276
耶稣对他说：“我?要他等到我来的时候，与你何干？ If I want him to live until I come,  what is that to you?

2146
02:53:29,820 --> 02:53:31,113
你跟从我吧！” (21:22) Follow me.

2147
02:53:31,697 --> 02:53:36,577
于是这话传在弟兄中间，说那门徒不死； So a report spread among the followers  of Jesus that this disciple would not die.

2148
02:53:36,994 --> 02:53:39,663
?实耶稣不是说他不死， But Jesus did not say he would not die.

2149
02:53:39,913 --> 02:53:44,626
乃是说：“我?要他等到我来的时候，与你何干？” (21:23) He said, "If I want him to live until I come,  what is that to you?"

2150
02:53:45,502 --> 02:53:48,213
为这些事作见证，并?记载这些事的 He is the disciple  who spoke of these things...

2151
02:53:48,297 --> 02:53:50,841
就是这门徒。 the one who also wrote them down...

2152
02:53:50,924 --> 02:53:53,552
我们也知道他的见证是真的。 (21:24) and we know that what he said is true.

2153
02:53:54,511 --> 02:53:57,431
耶稣所行的事还有许多； Now, there are many other things  that Jesus did.

2154
02:53:57,514 --> 02:54:01,727
?是一一的都写出来，我想， If they were all written down one by one,  I suppose that the whole world...

2155
02:54:01,810 --> 02:54:04,855
所写的书，就是世界也?不下了。 (21:25) could not hold the books  that would be written.

2156
02:54:09,264 --> 02:54:09,764
