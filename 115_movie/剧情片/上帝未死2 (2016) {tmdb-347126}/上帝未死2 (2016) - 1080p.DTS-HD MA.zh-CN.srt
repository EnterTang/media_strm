"Hold You Up"    Shane.Harper   singing

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,180
你曾坚信的真理，开始遭受瓦解逼迫
?When it's coming apart,you had it all?

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,870
这还不止
?It wasn't enough?

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,420
是的，还远不止
?No, it's not enough?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,190
他们告诉你，不值得如此去I卫真理
?They tell you，it's not worth the price

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,670
那就弃之真理不顾好了
?So just let it go?

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,350
但你知道你不能
?But you know you can't?

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,950
你知道你也不会这么去做
?You know you won't?

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:56,260
虽困难重重，不，还要为真理竭力争辩
?It's not easy, no， finding the words to say?

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,910
当你感到迷失时，你会寻找到神为你开的道路
?When you're feeling lost,you'll find your way?

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,590
这世界是如此的支离破碎，留给你的有时仅是冷漠
?The world is so broken and sometimes it leaves you cold?

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,340
在夜间你感觉不到亮火,真光来引导你归家
?At nighttimes you can't feel the fire to guide you home

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,830

?The demons will harm you and try to steal what you know?

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,550
但神所差派的天使帮助你脱离遭害
?But the angels,they brought you?

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,950

他们看到了你眼中的惧怕
?They see the fear in your eyes?

19
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,670
千斤重担如压心头
?Heart sinks like a stone?

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,660
因你惧怕，重压你灵魂
?Cause when you're afraid,it weighs on your soul?

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,990
时候将到，你就会知晓
?When the timing is right,somehow you'll know?

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:17,150
无人能站立得住，无人能靠自己站立得住
?When nobody stands,stand on your own?

23
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:27,070

?It's not easy, no,finding the words to say?

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,230

?At nighttimes you can't feel the fire to guide you home

这样的例子不胜枚举
The list goes on.

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,070
哲学家，诗人，科学家，作家
Philosophers, poets,scientists, authors,

136
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,350
他们都是学术界的泰斗
towering intellects,all of them.

137
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,710
但他们都有什么共同之处?
But what do theyall have in common?.

138
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,190
好的
Yes?.

139
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,270
他们都过世了
They're all dead.

140
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,080
嗯，这是不正确的
Well, that would beincorrect.

141
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,550
道金斯先生和乔姆斯基先生
Mr. Dawkins and Mr.Chomsky 

142
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,950
- 依然非常活跃在他们的专业领域，先生 -
arestill very much alive, Mister

143
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,780
（名叫）G-dog Gerard Trigga.
G-dog Gerard Trigga.

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,830
G-dog
G-dog.

145
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,500
还有其他人（回答）？
Anyone else?.

146
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,350
没有人？
No one?.

147
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,190
好吧，在世或过世的他们都是无神论者
Well, they are,or were...atheists.

148
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,270
第6世纪的法文"athe'isme,"
Based on the 1 6th-centuryFrench "athe'isme,"

149
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,190
是来源于希腊文 "theos"，意思是“上帝”
from the Greek "theos,"meaning "God,"

150
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,830
和前缀"a"演化而来
and from the prefix "a,"

151
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,750
在希腊文中"a"的意思就是“没有”
meaning, as it alwaysdoes in Greek, "without."

152
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,030
总之，每一个我写过名字的思想家
In short, each ofthe thinkers I named

153
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,830
强有力的回击了，这世界是没有上帝的
took the strong positionthat there is no God,

154
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,630
作为相对的弱势地位不可知论
as opposed to the weak positionof agnosticism.

155
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,830
诺斯替主义（"Gnostic"），来源于希腊语诺斯"gnosos"，所谓的“知”
"Gnostic," from the Greek"gnosos," to know,

156
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,830
又一次，带有前缀“a”的意思是不知道的，
and again, with the prefix "a"meaning to not know,

157
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,070
或者更准确地说，怀疑（宇宙中）一个至高无上的（上帝）存在
or more accurately, to doubt theexistence of a supreme being.

158
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,180
这学期，我建议大家拒绝
This semester,I propose that we refuse

159
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,390
浪费我们有限的时间在一起辩论（上帝）的存在
to waste our limited timetogether debating the existence

160
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,350
一个天空中的大男人，一个仁慈的神话
of the big man in the sky,the myth of a benevolent,

161
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,990
全能的，超自然的存在
all-powerful,supernatural being.

162
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,870
- 嘿！- 你的航程怎样？
- Hey!.- How was your flight?.

163
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,670
- 精彩.- 精彩？
- Wonderful.- Wonderful?.

164
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,270
这就像一次30个小时的飞行
It's likea 30-hour flight.

165
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,230
36小时
Thirty-six.

166
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,870
很乐意见到你
Great to see you.

167
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,710
很高兴认识你
Nice to see you.

168
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,910
达喀尔飞往苏黎世，苏黎世到法兰克福
Dakar to Zurich,Zurich to Frankfurt,

169
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,670
8小时的停留
an 8-hour layover,

170
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,990
而后直飞至卡特国际机场
and directto Carter lnternational.

171
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,630
唉，那精彩这词该如何诠释呢？
Ugh, how does that translateas wonderful?.

172
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,270
我很高兴，我很安全，现在我在这里，因上帝是良善的.
I'm happy, I'm safe, and nowI'm here because God is good.

173
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,910
一直
All the time.

174
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,510
一直？
And all the time?.

175
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,350
上帝是良善的
God is good.

176
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,110
上帝死了
God is dead.

177
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,390
当然，这是一个比喻，
This is, of course,a metaphor,

178
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,070
但一个说明性的意义，不是说上帝已经死了
but an illustrative one meaningnot that God has somehow died,

179
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,590
而是k从来没有首先存在
but rather that he neverexisted in the first place,

180
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,430
只是超出了我们祖先能想像的到而已
other than in the depthsof our forebears' imaginations.

181
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,340
k在过去的时代是一个有用的童话
He was a useful fairy talein ages gone by,

182
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,430
k的烈怒被用来解释的瘟疫发生
when his fiery anger was usedto explain away plagues

183
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,430
和农作物歉收，疾病和灾害
and crop failures,diseases and disasters,

184
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,990
我们现在所归诸于细菌和病毒
which we now ascribeto bacteria and viruses,

185
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,670
染色体疾病，和板块构造
chromosomal disorders,and plate tectonics.

186
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,350
总之，是科学和理性取代了迷信
In short, science and reasonhave supplanted superstition,

187
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,350
这一切都变得更好
and we areall the better for it.

188
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,990
经过你们的许可后
And with your permission,

189
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,270
我想我们一起绕过这种虚无的辩论
I would like to bypass thissenseless debate all together

190
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,950
而直接跳到结论
and jump to the conclusion

191
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,390
你们每一个大二学生都应该意识到
of which every sophomoreis already aware of:

192
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,940
其实上帝不存在
there is no God.

193
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,350
我要求你们每一个人
All that I requirefrom each of you

194
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,550
就是刚才我让诸位填写的文件
is that you fill inthe papers I've just given you

195
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,830
有三个小字：“上帝死了”
with three little words:"God is dead,"

196
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,470
请签上你的大名
along with your signature.

197
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,190
我们越快达成一致共识，
The sooner we reacha unanimous consensus,

198
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,790
这是我所期望的
which I expect we will,

199
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,150
我将避免那些枯燥、
I will be sparedthe tedious duty

200
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,870
争论不止的乏味论点
of slogging throughdry and dusty arguments,

201
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,420
你将绕开部分课程
and you will bypassthe section of the course

202
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,470
当你接受这些传统
in which studentshave traditionally received

203
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,190
可以获得这学期的最低等级分数
their lowest gradesof the semester.

204
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,590
当你签完字后，请把纸放右边
And when you finish, pleasepass your papers to the right.

205
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,910
谢谢
Thank you.

206
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,470
谢谢
Thank you.

207
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,990
呵呵，一个小写的“g”
Oh, a lower case "g."

208
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,630
也许这一个应得到额外的学分
Maybe this oneought to get extra credit.

209
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,870
谢谢
Thank you.

210
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,670
对不起，先生 -
Excuse me, Mister--

211
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,350
惠顿乔什.惠顿
Wheaton.Josh Wheaton.

212
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,830
惠顿先生，有什么问题吗？
Mr. Wheaton,is something wrong?.

213
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,830
是的，我不能
Yeah, I can't.

214
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,470
我不能做你想要我做的
I can't dowhat you want.

215
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,110
我是一个基督徒
I'm a Christian.

216
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,710
呵呵，别担心.
Oh, don't worry.

217
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,550
你仍然可以回到你的宿舍里
You can still go backto your dorm room

218
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,190
曲膝
and sink to your knees

219
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,790
在你的床边祷告，如果你愿意的话
and pray to your bedsideif you'd like.

220
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,790
你在你的个人生活做什么，那是你的事情
What you do in yourpersonal life is your business,

221
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,190
但你在课堂上做什么，是我来管.
but what you doin this class is mine.

222
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,030
我不能.
I can't.

223
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,670
好吧，惠顿先生.
Alright, Mr. Wheaton.

224
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,150
请允许我解释下替代选择.
Allow me to explainthe alternative.

225
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,710
如果不让你自己在教室上承认
If you cannot bring yourselfto admit that God is dead

226
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,310
上帝已死
for the purposes of this class,

227
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,940
那么你将要至I卫上帝并没有死
then you will needto defend the antithesis

228
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,590
这个对立面上
that God is not dead.

229
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,790
而你需要做的是站在这个教室的
And you'll need to do itin front of this class

230
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,030
讲台这里
from the podium.

231
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,750
如果你失败了，你不得不失去本次机会
And if you fail, as you shall,you will fail this section

232
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,710
而且你立即失去你期末成绩的30%
and lose 30% of your final graderight off the bat.

233
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,830
你准备好接受（挑战)吗？
Are you readyto accept that?.

234
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,470
好的，那谁能决定我是否赢
Well, who would decidewhether I won

235
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,630
或者输了这场辩论
or lost the argument?.

236
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,350
没事，我可以
Well, I would.

237
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,030
这是我的课堂，我的规则
It's my class, my rules.

238
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,670
分级是我的特权
Grading's my prerogative.

239
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,150
我没有不尊重你，但我不确定你可以做到很客观
No disrespect, but I'm not sureyou can be objective.

240
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,710
你有何建议
What would you propose?.

241
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,030
那么，他们怎么样
Well, what about them?.

242
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,670
嗯，这很有趣
Well, that's interesting,

243
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,390
但为什么想要我授权给他们？
but why would I wantto empower them?.

244
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,990
好了，你已经赢了他们.
Well, you've alreadywon them over.

245
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,070
我的意思是，我必须让不信服的他们，
I mean, I'd have tounconvince them,

246
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,670
让他们承认他们错了.
get them to admitthey were wrong.

247
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,240
好吧，惠顿先生.
Alright, Mr. Wheaton.

248
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,870
你将拥有3次的辩论机会
You'll get 3 sessions,

249
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,830
接下来3堂课的最后20分钟
the last 20 minutesof each of the next 3 classes,

250
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,950
投放你的案例
to make your case.

251
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,230
我保证我的干扰会降到最低
I promise to keepmy interruptions to a minimum.

252
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,510
你可以在课堂上采用任何你喜欢的问题
You may take whatever questionsyou'd like from the class,

253
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,190
但我不会增加分配给你的时间
but I will not increaseyour allotted time.

254
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,870
当然，你要完成
Of course,you'll be responsible

255
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,460
布置给你的所有其他课堂作业
for all the otherclass assignments.

256
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,350
不过，你知道，你可以改变你的想法
But, you know,you could change your mind

257
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,390
在下节课带来你签过名字的声明
and bring in your signedstatement at our next class,

258
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,230
我们将往前看，当这件事情没发生过一样
and we'll go forward as thoughnone of this ever happened.

259
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,270
我们其余的人,已经除去了原始的迷信
The rest of us, having dispensedwith primitive superstition,

260
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,350
将我们的焦点转向在现实世界的问题
will turn our focus tothe issue of being in reality.

261
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,390
关于我们下一堂课，
For our next class,

262
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,230
请务必先预习下戴维・休谟的《归纳法问题》

and Renee Descartes'"Discourse on Method,"

264

265
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,110
“为什么我不是基督徒”
"Why I Am Not a Christian"

266
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,510
准备到惠顿先生的讲座中
in preparationfor Mr. Wheaton's lecture

267
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,260
感谢他的失败，以帮助我们实现
and in thanks for hisfailure to help us reach

268
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,670
一致的共识
a unanimous consensus.

269
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,190
我明白，你不想否认你的信仰
You don't want to denyyour faith, I get it.

270
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,630
所以，答案很简单：降级
So, the answer's simple:drop the class.

271
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,510
是的，但我不确保我能做到这一点
Yeah, but I'm not sureI can do that.

272
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,310
我感觉上帝希望有人为他卫道.
I feel like God wantssomeone to defend him.

273
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,350
别傻了.
Don't be ridiculous.

274
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,870
我不知道，我只是不停的思考
I don't know,I just keep thinking

275
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,910
C.S.刘易斯的信条（英国20世纪著名的文学家，学者，杰出的批评家，公认的二十世纪最重要的基督教作者之一）
of that C.S. Lewis line,

276
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,470
真正的危险，是考验一个人信仰真实与否的试金石
"Only a real risk cantest the reality of a belief."

277
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,190
所以，因此你要把我们未来会发生的危机，也对之相对比
So, you're gonna risk our futureover your yearbook quote?.

278
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,790
乔什，我为什么在这里？
Josh, why am I here?.

279
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,430
你好，欢迎回到地球，乔什
Hello, earth to Josh.

280
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,910
我为什么，我们在毕业班毕业时曾致词过
Why am l, Salutatorianof our graduating class,

281
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,910
这里是我的第三选择志愿学校？
here at mythird-choice school?.

282
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,550
对不起，我有在未来50年
I'm sorry for havingthe next 50 years

283
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,190
关于我们生活的计划了
of our life planned out.

284
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,790
这就是真正的我
That's just who I am.

285
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,430
我不知道，凯拉 ，只是
I don't know, Kara,it's just--

286
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,630
乔什，我爱你，但是我绝对不许你
Josh, I love you,but I absolutely forbid you

287
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,630
在教授自己的课堂上去反对他
to go up against this professorin his own classroom.

288
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,350
这对我们是利益攸关的
We have too much at stake.

289
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,550
整个事情的操纵手段，使你看起来像一个白痴
The whole thing's riggedto make you look like an idiot,

290
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,390
如果你想进入法学院，
and if you wantto get into law school,

291
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,030
你这门课一定不能不及格
you can't affordto flunk this class.

292
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,270
甚至一个“C”可能也是灾难性的
Even a "C"could be disastrous.

293
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:15,990


294
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,910
我不知道你为什么穿高跟鞋
I don't know whyyou wear those heels.

295
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,550
这双鞋有什么问题吗？
What's wrong with 'em?.

296
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,190
你太高了，你比我高了
You're too tall.You're taller than me.

297
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,790
你是男人，足以应付它
You're man enoughto handle it.

298
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,590
我只是说，我不希望在舞会是矮个
I'm just saying, I don't wantto be the short guy at the prom.

299
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,230
罗伯逊先生！
Mr. Robertson!

300
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,870
嗨，或者我应该叫你威利？
Hi, or should lcall you Willie?.

301
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,510
你可以叫我威利
You can call me Willie.

302
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,310
艾米.瑞安，“新左派”是我的博客专栏
Amy Ryan,I blog "The New Left."

303
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,950
我可以问你几个问题吗？
Can I ask youa few questions?.

304
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,550
当然可以,说吧, 这是我妻子―
Yeah, sure, fire away.This is my wife--

305
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,150
科丽，我知道了
Korie, I know.

306
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,150
实际上，在这里看到你，我很惊讶
I'm actually surprisedto see you here.

307
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,270
我以为你在回家，赤着脚，还怀孕
I thought you'd be home,barefoot and pregnant.

308
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,190
我没有赤脚，孕妇已经过去了很长一段时间
I haven't been barefoot andpregnant in a really long time.

309
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,830
我还挺怀念那些日子，是吧？
I do kindamiss those days, huh?.

310
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,670
是啊，你要开始再次？我们可以试试
Yeah, you want to startagain?. We can try.

311
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,350
不
No.

312
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,990
你已经赚了一笔销售设备
You've made a fortuneselling devices

313
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,070
那些旨在吸引水鸟至它们死亡
that are designed to lurewater fowl to their deaths.

314
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,110
哦，我当你说想“你”
Oh, I guesswhen you say "you,"

315
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,990
你指的是我的全体家人
you're referring to thewhole group of my family,

316
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,670
这将是“你”
which would be "y'all."

317
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,390
你可以只将其更改为“你们”
You can justchange it to "y'all."

318
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,030
这会是一个更简单的表达
That'd be aneasier expression,

319
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,630
这样，大家都在那里了
that way it'll geteverybody in there.

320
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,670
所以，你们都已经发了财，是不是啊？
So, y'all have madea fortune, isn't that right?.

321
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,310
我们正在做的还不错
We're doing alright.

322
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,950
我们可以买的皮车卡还是大轮胎
We can certainly buybigger tires on our trucks

323
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,830
四轮驱动，不会陷在泥地里
and four-wheelersto get out in the mud with,

324
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,430
所以生活是美好的
so life is good.

325
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,270
是什么让你认为，你有道德权利
What makes you thinkyou have the moral right

326
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,470
四处残害和杀害无辜的动物？
to go around maiming andkilling innocent animals?.

327
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,630
嘿，看看，让我们弄清楚一件事
Hey, look, let's just getone thing straight.

328
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,270
我不是残害什么
I ain't maiming nothing.

329
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,750
无论我看到、我瞄准和我射击
Whatever I see and I aim at,I shoot.

330
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,390
当我射击后，我杀了它，然后我吃了它
When I shoot it,I kill it and then I eat it.

331
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,990
所以，你就杀了那些鸭子？
So, you do killthose ducks?.

332
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,030
当然，我这样做了.我该怎么办呢？
Of course I do.What am I gonna do,

333
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,670
当要煮它们的时候，它们还在动？
cook 'em while they'restill moving around?.

334
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,310
这才是残酷的事情
That would be cruel.

335
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,910
那就糟糕了
That'd be bad.

336
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,350
那么，这不是一种（杀戮）行为？你确实为你所做的感到自豪？
So, this isn't an act?. You'reactually proud of what you do?.

337
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,390
我当然如此感觉.我如果不感到自豪我为什么怎么做？
Of course I am. Why would ldo it if I'm not proud of it?.

338
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,030
那么，你认同他所说的每件事？
And you go alongwith everything he says?.

339
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,630
我们已经结婚20年
We've been marriedfor 20 years.

340
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,630
他说的每件事，我并非都认同
I don't go alongwith everything he says,

341
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,030
但在重要的事情上，是的
but on the thingsthat matter, yeah,

342
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,150
我完全赞同
I agree wholeheartedly.

343
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,510
那么，对那些在节目中被你冒犯的人，你要说些什么？
So, what do you say to peoplewho are offended by your show,

344
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,230
不仅仅是因为狩猎
not just becauseof the hunting,

345
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,670
而是因为你在每一集中公开向耶稣祷告?
but because you openly prayto Jesus in every episode?.

346
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,340
嘿,我们没有试图去冒犯任何人,好吗?
Hey, we're not tryingto offend anybody, alright?.

347
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,980
如果他们不想看这节目，他们可以换频道
If they don't want to watch theshow, they can turn the channel.

348
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,710
至于我向耶稣祷告
As far as mypraying to Jesus,

349
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,070
我的人生和我所有的全部都属乎上帝
my life and my whole eternitybelongs to God.

350
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,950
所有这一切都是暂时的：金钱，名利，成功
All this stuff is temporary:the money, fame, success.

351
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,590
暂时的
T emporary.

352
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,270
甚至人生也是暂时的
Even life is temporary.

353
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,230
耶稣，才是永恒的
Jesus, that's eternal.

354
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,830
耶稣（在圣经）这样说：
Jesus said this:

355
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,950
凡在人面前认我的，
"Whoever acknowledgesme before men,"

356
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,760
我在我天上的父面前也必认他（太10：32）
he will acknowledgebefore the Father in heaven.

357
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,540
凡在人面前不认我的，我在我天上的父面前也必不认他.（太10：33）
"Whoever disowns me,I'll disown him to the Father."

358
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,350
这些经文很重要，现在是用红字标注的
Now, those words are writtenin red so they're important.

359
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,990
就是这样？
And that's it?.

360
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,590
就是这样.这就是我们要讨论的
That's it.That's what we're going with.

361
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,230
很简单，不是吗？
Pretty simple, isn't it?.

362
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,870
感谢您的宝贵时间
Thanks for your time.

363
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,470
来吧，让我们做一些确认
Come on, let's godo some acknowledging.

364
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,110
欢迎你加入我们的行列
You're welcome to join us.

365
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,670
不，谢谢，我很好.
No thanks, I'm good.

366
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,270
你很好？
You're good?.

367
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,910
好吧.
Alright.

368
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,870
那位女士是谁？
Who was that lady?.

369
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:12,350


370
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:23,750


371
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,350
你非常美
You're beautiful.

372
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,790
我希望你不要这么做
I wish youdidn't have to do that.

373
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,070
为了我的父亲，他非常保守的
It's for my father.He's very traditional.

374
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,270


375
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,740


376
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,910
你和谁说话？
Who were you talking to?.

377
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,950
没有人
No one.

378
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,950
阿依莎，我知道活在他们的世界里很难
Ayisha, I know it's hardliving in their world

379
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,670
而且还要与此分离
and being apart from it,

380
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,900
一个你能看，却不可触碰的世界
a world you can seebut can't touch.

381
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,590
我知道他们看上去很快乐
I know they seem happy,

382
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:27,430
但要知道，当你环顾周围所有的人
but know that when you lookaround at all those people,

383
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,950
没有一个人在敬拜上帝
there is no onewho worships God,

384
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,990
不是他应受和要求的敬拜方式
not the way he deservesand demands to be worshipped.

385
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,030
我们不能忘记我们是谁，我们该做什么
We must never forgetwho and what we are.

386
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,550
这是最重要的事情
That is the mostimportant thing.

387
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,630
是的，爸爸
Yes, Baba.

388
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:05,150
我只坚持这一点，因为我爱你
I only insist on thisbecause I love you.

389
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,390
你知道的，不是吗？
You know that, don't you?.

390
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,630
我爱你？
That I love you?.

391
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,990
当然，爸爸
Of course, Baba.

392
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,310
你需要帮忙吗？
Can I help you?.

393
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,310
你在等人？
You waiting for someone?.

394
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,950
是的，你可以这么说
Yeah, you could say that.

395
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,310
看起来，在这一刻，k好像出去了
It looks like he'sout at the moment.

396
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,710
好吧，那可能就是k派遣我来的原因吧
Well, maybethat's why he sent me.

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,350
我们是未来的勇士
?We are the future heroes?

402
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,270
一场暄丽多彩的交响乐
?A colorful symphony?

403
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,070
我们就是那些人
We are the ones

404
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,670
我本可放弃这门课，跑开
I could drop the class,run away,

405
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,310
假装什么都没有发生
pretend likeit never happened,

406
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,820
这就是我的女朋友想要的
which is whatmy girlfriend wants.

407
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,190
我可以在纸上签署我本不相信的事
I could sign the paper sayingsomething I don't believe.

408
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,030
或者我要在现场观众面前犯学术自杀
Or I commit academic suicidein front of a live audience

409
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,710
是为了试图证明上帝存在
by trying to provethat God exists.

410
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,830
选这门课的人有多少？
How many peoplein that class?.

411
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,420
可能80个
Eighty maybe.

412
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,590
他们当中有多少人，你认为
And how many of themdo you think

413
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,230
曾在这里停留过脚步
would everstep foot in here,

414
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,790
或在其它任何教会
or any other churchfor that matter?.

415
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,110
好吧，也许没有
Well, none probably.

416
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,230
所以，你接受了这个挑战，
So, your acceptanceof this challenge,

417
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,630
假如你决定接受它，
if you decide to accept it,

418
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,670
唯一能较为深入接触到上帝和耶稣的机会
may be the only meaningfulexposure to God and Jesus

419
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,390
他们却没曾有过
they'll ever have.

420
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,070
是啊
Yeah.

421
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,710
是的，我也是怎么想的
Yeah, I suppose so.

422
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,230
请查阅马太福音10:32-33
Check outMatthew 1 0:32-33.

423
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,070
什么，这是这些？就这样？
What, that's it?.That's all?.

424
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,910
是的
Yeah.

425
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,270
只是一个圣经引用？
Just a Scriptural citation?.

426
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,910
如果你查阅上述经文后，还是犹豫不决
If you're still undecidedafter that one,

427
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,550
请看路加福音12:48
Iook at Luke 1 2:48.

428
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,550
这不可能如此简单
It can't be that simple.

429
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,150
当然可以
Sure it can.

430
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,110
你在这里，因为在你里面还有微小的声音
You're here because thatstill small voice inside you

431
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,060
对别人想要你做出的选择感到不开心
isn't happy with the choiceseveryone else wants you to make.

432
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,070
就我个人而言，我认为这是圣灵与你说话
Personally, I think it's theHoly Spirit talking to you.

433
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,990
如果我们不消灭圣灵的感动，k会一直作催促感化的工作
That's how he interacts with usif we allow him to.

434
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,590
所有你需要做的就是决定
All you have to dois decide

435
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,550
你是否愿意听从
whether or notyou're willing to listen.

436
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,990
这不容易，却很简单
It's not easy,but it's simple.

437
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,070
凡在人面前认我的，
"So everyone whoacknowledges me before men,

438
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,190
我在我天上的父面前也必认他；（马太福音10：32）
"l also will acknowledge beforemy Father who is in heaven,

439
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,190
“凡在人面前不认我的，
"but whoeverdenies me before men,

440
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,710
我在我天上的父面前也必不认他.（马太福音10：33）
I also will deny beforemy Father who is in heaven."

441
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,790
惟有那不知道的，
"Everyone to whommuch was given,

442
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,630
做了当受责打的事，必少受责打.
"of him much will be required,

443
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,110
因为多给谁，就向谁多取；
"and from him to whomthey entrusted much,

444
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,830
多托谁，就向谁多要.（路加福音12：48）
they will demand the more."

445
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,430


446
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,270
对不起，我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

447
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,860
我必须处理好一大堆事，才能来这里
I had to move a ton of stuffaround just to get here.

448
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,510
没事
That's alright.

449
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,270
请坐，瑞恩小姐
Please, go and have a seatMs. Ryan.

450
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,910


451
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,910
哦，对不起，第二次了
Oh, excuse me a second.

452
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,430
我们根据你上星期的化验单得到了诊断结果
We've gotten your results backfrom your test the last week.

453
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,270


454
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,870
好吧，我是说 -
Okay, as I was saying--

455
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,510


456
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,830
我很抱歉，这个电话我必须要接
I'm so sorry.I have got to take this call.

457
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,670
艾米
Amy.

458
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,190
你的化验单显示是阳性
Your resultscame back positive.

459
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,110
你得了癌症
You have cancer.

460
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,310
我没时间治疗癌症
I don't have timefor cancer.

461
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,910
我太忙了
I'm too busy.

462
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,870
听着，癌细胞已经扩散到周围组织
Listen, it's already growninto the surrounding tissue.

463
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,910
你的淋巴结有感染，你的血液标志物
Your lymph nodes are involvedand your blood markers indicate

464
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,350
也有向远处转移的证据
evidenceof distant metastasis.

465
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,550
现在，我已经为你排好了 核磁共振检查
Now, I've alreadyscheduled you for an MRl.

466
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,070
我们需要确定它（癌细胞）扩散的程度
We need to determinethe extent of it.

467
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,070
我知道你很重要
I know you'revery important

468
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,660
这世界没有你，将无法正常运转
and the world can'tget along without you,

469
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,270
但是我的工作是让你知道
but it's my jobto let you know

470
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,830
那可能会确切的发生在你身上
that it may be preparingto do exactly that,

471
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,430
当然，除非你立即开始治疗
and it certainly will unlessyou begin immediate treatment.

472
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,430
你明白吗？
Do you understand?.

473
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,790
嘿，宝贝
Hey babe.

474
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,430
宝贝，你去哪里了？你手机关机了？
Babe, where've you been?.Did you turn your phone off?.

475
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,390
更像我忘了手机开机
More like I forgotto turn my phone on.

476
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,750
你知道今天是什么日子？
Do you knowwhat day it is?.

477
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,550
周四？

478
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,430
还有别的？
Anything else?.

479
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,790
第13？
The 13th?.

480
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,310
周年快乐
Happy anniversary.

481
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,590
六年前，你我的青春触碰
Six years ago, your youth groupcollided with mine.

482
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,230
你想起来了吧
You remembered.

483
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,990
嗯，嗯，我们要庆祝一下
Mm-hmm, andwe're gonna celebrate.

484
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,590
你还记得我们是怎么认识？
You remember how we met?.

485
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,180
因为 Newsboys 乐队（现代摇滚乐团）
The Newsboys.

486
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,430
下周五他们会在镇上
They're gonna bein town next Friday.

487
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,350
你让我太惊喜了，这就是为什么我爱你
You are amazing,which is why I love you.

488
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,950
听我说，我知道我昨天的处理方式太过强势
Look, I know I came off probablyway too strong yesterday.

489
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,590
你知道，我只是 -
You know, I just--

490
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,110
我担心一些外面的事进入我们的生活
I get concerned when outsidethings start coming between us.

491
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,110
你懂我的意思，是不？
You get that, can't you?.

492
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,230
- 当然- 原谅我？- 永远
- Sure.- Forgive me?.- Always.

493
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,070
来吧
Come on.

494
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,390
我只是需要 -
I just need--

495
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,310
哇！
Whoa!

496
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,190
好吧，那总不会都是统计学吧
Well, that can'tall be Statistics.

497
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,030
乔什，请告诉我，你没有一直
Josh, please tell meyou haven't been spending

498
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,700
花时间在哲学上面
all your timeon that philosophy thing.

499
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,230
不是所有的（时间）
Not all of it.

500
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,470
好的，大部分时间
Okay, most of it.

501
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,150
乔什，这不好笑
Josh, that's not funny.

502
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,830
好吧，这真的不是
Okay, it's really not.

503
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,670
听我说，这是我想做的事，好吗？
Look, this is somethingI want to do, okay?.

504
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,270
我不知道我之间怎么了
I don't understandhow it comes between us.

505
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,190
乔什，你所做的一切是要关于我们的
Josh, everythingyou do is about us.

506
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,270
好吧，我们是一个团队
Okay, we're a team.

507
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,790
我的意思是，我们在做什么，6年到永远，对不？
I mean, we're what, 6 yearsgoing on forever, right?.

508
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,950
那意味着你的成绩，你的整个未来
That means your grades,your whole future,

509
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,630
我是其中的一部分
I'm a part of that.

510
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,150
我不明白这能使我们的未来受益？
I don't see how thisis contributing to our future.

511
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,870
那，即没有我的父母
Yeah, well,neither do my parents

512
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,870
也没有我生命中的其他人
or anyone else in my life.

513
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,510
该怎么告诉你呢
What should that tell you

514
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,150
是不是每个人爱你的人
if every single personthat loves you

515
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,470
都要说完全一样的事情？
is sayingthe exact same thing?.

516
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,190
乔什，我正在让你知道现在要为自己考虑
Josh, I'm letting you know nowfor your own good,

517
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,230
这个实验已经结束
this experiment is over.

518
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,630
你需要优先考虑和决定
You need to prioritizeand decide

519
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,230
谁是你生命中最重要的人，
who's the most importantperson in your life,

520
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,980
我还是雷森迪教授？
me or Professor Radisson?.

521
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,350
如果我的选择是上帝
What if it's God?.

522
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,590
上帝要你和我在一起，所以这是相同的答案
God wants you with me,so it's the same answer.

523
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,150
把书还给图书馆，在那张愚蠢的纸上签上字
Return the books to the library,sign the stupid paper,

524
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,950
然后向前行
and move on.

525
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,830
从现在开始一年之后，我们回头看这些，只会想笑
A year from now, we'lllook back on this and laugh.

526
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,310
我们已经不是在高中了
We're not inhigh school anymore.

527
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,470
你现在作出的决定能有真正的后果
The decisions you make nowcan have real consequences.

528
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,790
乔什
Josh!

529
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,430
乔什，这挺严重的
Josh, this is serious.

530
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,190
我知道
I know.

531
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,390
你知道
You know.

532
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,710
我不能相信,我要开12小时的车程到佛罗里达是为了做一些
I can't believe I'm makinga 12 hour drive to Florida

533
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,540
我12岁时会做的一些事
to do things that seemedcorny when I was 1 2.

534
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,460
大卫，我答应给我母亲一张我在米老鼠耳朵中的照片
David, I promised my mothera picture of me in mouse ears

535
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,470
而且还是站在童话城堡前的
standing in frontof the fairy tale castle.

536
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,270
我呢站在米老鼠耳朵中，照片是给她的
The mouse ears are for me,picture is for her.

537
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,190
对你来说，这是旧帽子，但对我来说，却是梦想成真
T o you, it's old-hat, but to me,it's a lifelong dream come true.

538
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,230
你难道不能理解吗？
Can you notunderstand that?.

539
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,140
然后我们就去坐潜艇到海底
Then we'll go forthe undersea submarine ride.

540
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,110
事实上，我觉得他们好像在20年前就把设施关闭了
Actually, I think they closedthat ride like 20 years ago.

541
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,950
然后我们将乘坐世界上最大的过山车
And then we'll ride theworld's biggest roller coaster.

542
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,790
第16大
Sixteenth biggest.

543
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,790
在我的脑海里，当我们下降时而尖叫
In my mind, whenI'm screaming as we descend,

544
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,710
这将是世界上最大的
it will bethe world's biggest

545
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,590
我会很高兴，（我认为最大）不是因为它的高度
and I'll be glad thatit's not taller than it is.

546
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,670


547
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,310
这听起来有点问题
That doesn't sound good.

548
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,590


549
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,190
是不是因为电池问题 -
Maybe the battery--

550
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,830


551
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,590
或许发动机
Or the starter.

552
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,670
无论是那样坏了，我们现在去不了任何地方
Either way, we're notgoing anywhere right now.

553
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,630
我会打电话并安排汽车租赁的
I'll call and arrangefor a rental car.

554
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,710
但是，我们怎么拿到所租的车？
But how will weget to the rental car?.

555
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,350
他们把车给我们送过来的
They'll deliver it to us.

556
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,990
你说真的？
Are you serious?.

557
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,590
是的，肯定
Yeah, absolutely.

558
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,430
他们会把我们要开的车给送过来的？
They'll deliver usthe car we are to drive?.

559
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,070
是的
Yeah.

560
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,710
喂？
Hello?.

561
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,310
太有意思了
Amazing.

562
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,150
但也有一些家伙在那里
But there are someflat-earthers out there

563
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,110
还仍然认为存在一个至高的上帝
who still consider theexistence of a supreme deity

564
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,390
要么必要的，要么不言自明的，或者两者兼而有之
to be either necessary,or self-evident, or both.

565
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,750
正如先前所宣布那样
And with that,as previously announced,

566
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,030
我要把讲台让给惠顿先生了
I will be turning the podiumover to Mr. Wheaton,

567
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,750
谁将呈现案例赞同
who will be presentinghis case in favor

568
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,630
（宇宙)存在一个至高无上的独裁者
of a supremecelestial dictator,

569
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,030
也被称为上帝
otherwise known as God.

570
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,070
惠顿先生，你准备好了吗？
Mr. Wheaton,are you ready?.

571
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,660
讲台是你的
Podium is yours.

572
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,070
无神论者说，没有人能证明上帝的存在
Atheists say that no onecan prove the existence of God,

573
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,470
是的，他们是对的
and well, they're right.

574
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,620
但我是说没有人能反驳上帝的存在是虚假
But I say no one candisprove that God exists.

575
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,510
但辩论这个问题的唯一途径
But the only wayto debate this issue

576
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,150
是看现有的证据
is to look atthe available evidence,

577
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,190
这就是我们要做的
and that's whatwe're going to do.

578
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,510
在判断上帝（是否存在）事上
We're going toput God on trial,

579
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,140
由雷森迪教授担任检控官
with Professor Radissonas the prosecutor,

580
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,070
而我作为辩护律师
and meas the defense attorney,

581
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,030
而你们都是陪审团
and you as the jury.

582
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,950
大多数宇宙学家都认同
Most cosmologists now agree

583
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,430
我们的宇宙起源于137亿年前
that the universe begansome 1 3.7 billion years ago

584
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,990
称为宇宙大爆炸事件
in an eventknown as the Big Bang.

585
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,510
那么，让我们来看看理论物理学家
So, let's lookat theoretical physicist

586
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,710
和诺贝尔物理学奖得主史蒂芬.温伯格关于
and Nobel Prize winnerSteven Weinberg's description

587
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,990
宇宙大爆炸的描述
of what the Big Bangwould have looked like.

588
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,950
而且因为他是一个无神论者
And since he's an atheist,

589
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,070
我们能肯定在他的描述中
we can be surethere isn't any believer-bias

590
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,710
没有任何信仰倾向
in his description.

591
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,630
起初发生了一个大爆炸
In the beginning,there was an explosion,

592
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,750
在最初3分钟里
and in 3 minutes,98% of the matter there is

593
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,070
形成了宇宙中98%的物质
or ever will be,was produced.

594
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,430
我们曾有一个宇宙
We had a universe.

595
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,070
已有2500年
For 2,500 years,

596
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,580
大多数科学家同意亚里士多德的思想
most scientists agreedwith Aristotle on the idea

597
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,270
一个稳定状态的宇宙
of a steady-state universe,

598
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,980
宇宙一直存在
that the universehas always existed

599
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,830
没有起始，也没有结束.但圣经不同意此观点
with no beginning and no end,but the Bible disagreed.

600
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,390
在20世纪20年代，比利时天文学家乔治・勒梅特，一位有神论者
In the 1 920s, Belgian astronomerGeorges Lematre, a theist,

601
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,990
他其实是-
who was actually also--

602
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,790
什么是有神论者？
What's a theist?.

603
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,870
有神论者是那些相信上帝存在的人
A theist is someone who believesin the existence of God.

604
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,550
他说，整个宇宙横空出世
He said that the entire universejumping into existence

605
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,430
在万亿分之万亿分之万亿分之一秒
in a trillionthof a trillionth of a second,

606
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,110
自虚无至
out of nothingness,

607
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,150
不可思议的强烈闪光发出
in an unimaginablyintense flash of light

608
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,740
这就是他对宇宙形成的回答
is how he would expectthe universe to respond

609
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,870
假如上帝确实在创世记1:3发出命令
if God were to actually utterthe command in Genesis 1 :3,

610
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,350
“要有光.”
"Let there be light."

611
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,790
换句话说，宇宙的起源开始呈现
In other words, the originof the universe unfolded

612
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,270
读创世纪后，确实会如上所述
exactly how one would expectafter reading Genesis,

613
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,110
在2500年间
and for 2,500 years,

614
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:05,310
圣经始终是正确的，科学却曾发生谬误
the Bible had it rightand science had it wrong.

615
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,190
好么，你最早能在5点钟赶到这里？
So, the earliestyou can get here is 5?.

616
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,030
好吧，我们会在这等你
Okay, we'll be waiting.

617
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,310
等等，它有空调，对不对？
Wait, it hasair conditioning, right?.

618
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,470
好的，谢谢.
Okay, thanks.

619
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,620
嗯，看来我们直到今晚也不会到达那里
Well, looks like we won'tget there 'til late tonight.

620
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,190
对不起，我想你错过了整整一天在（迪士尼)公园的时间
Sorry, I think you're gonnamiss an entire day at the park.

621
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,830
这没关系，大卫.
It's okay, David.

622
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,500
我敢肯定，我们今天可以好好利用在这里的时间
I'm sure we can make good useof our time here today.

623
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,190
当然可以与唱诗班负责人交通
Sure.

624
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,870
我们
We can meetthe choir director,

625
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,750
为即将演唱的音乐会一起选择歌曲
talk about song choicesfor the upcoming concert.

626
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,750
或者我们可以见一下姐妹团契
Or we could meetthe women's club

627
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,710
探讨下一个手工艺品（教堂）义卖的细节
about the detailsfor the next craft bazaar.

628
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,430
很多重要的东西
Lots of important stuff.

629
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,110
还有，趁你还没离开
And since you're not leaving,

630
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,310
你还有时间和米娜一起吃午饭
you'll have timeto meet Mina for lunch.

631
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,080
对了，我还能和米娜一起吃午饭
Right, I can meetMina for lunch.

632
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,470
听起来，你比我好像更需要这个假期
Sounds like you need thisvacation more than I do.

633
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,030
不，我只想做一些有意义的事情
No, I just need to dosome meaningful work

634
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,030
这样我才能过好这个假期
so that I can have somethingto take a vacation from.

635
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,620
你应该知道，我们做的一些最重要的事情
You know, some of the mostimportant work that we do

636
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,310
对我们来说，或许意义不大
may seem meaningless to us.

637
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,990
像那些传教士一样
This comingfrom the missionary

638
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,750
在（属灵的）战壕中真真切切的
who literallyis in the trenches,

639
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,230
每日为上帝赢得新心
winning hearts for the Lordon a daily basis.

640
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,980
大卫，上帝会差派你到k预备你去的地方
David, God has youexactly where he wants you.

641
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,830
k的信实也在每一件细小的事情上
He who is faithfulin a very little thing

642
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,070
当然在大事也同样信实
is also faithful in much.

643
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,030
上帝知道你正在做的事情
God knowsyou're doing the work.

644
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,870
这也是k宏伟计划的一部分
It's all partof his grand design.

645
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,110
所有这些都指向有一个上帝创造了它（宇宙）
All of which points to a Godthat created it.

646
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,470
你看，在现实世界中，我们从来没看到事物
You see, in the real world,we never see things

647
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,830
由无有到存在
jumping into existenceout of nothingness,

648
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,590
但无神论者希望在这规则上做些小例外
but atheists want to make onesmall exception to this rule,

649
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,470
即宇宙和其上的一切本就存在
namely, the universeand everything in it.

650
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,550
但在他的著作《上帝错觉》
But in his book,"The God Delusion,"

651
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,190
理查德・道金斯如此述说：
Richard Dawkins says

652
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,430
假如你告诉我，是上帝创造了宇宙
that, "lf you tell meGod created the universe,

653
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,310
那么我就有权利问你是谁创造了上帝
then I have the rightto ask you who created God."

654
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,350
道金斯的议题才有意义
Dawkins' questiononly makes sense

655
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,110
按照谁创造了一位上帝（逻辑）
in terms of a Godwho has been created.

656
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,780
对于非受造的上帝来说是没有意义的
It doesn't make sensein terms of an uncreated God,

657
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,030
这就是基督徒所信仰的上帝
which is the kind of Godthat Christians believe in.

658
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,670
甚至在方程式中把上帝替换
And even leaving Godout of the equation,

659
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,870
我也有权利把道金斯先生的问题
I then have a right to turnMr. Dawkins's own question

660
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,270
还给他，询问他
back around on him and ask,

661
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,710
假如宇宙创造了你，那么谁创造了宇宙？
"lf the universe created you,then who created the universe?. "

662
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,460
你看，无论是有神论者和无神论者都背负
You see, both the theist andthe atheist are both burdened

663
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,470
回答同样的问题
with answeringthis same question

664
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,550
关于物质的起源
of how did things start.

665
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,430
我希望你能领悟到
What I'm hopingyou'll pick up from all this

666
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,150
你没必要先把知识给扼杀掉
is that you don't have tocommit intellectual suicide

667
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,790
再去相信创造主背后的创造
to believe in a Creatorbehind the creation.

668
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,510
在某种程度上，你根本不允许有上帝
And to the extentthat you don't allow for God,

669
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,910
你会很难找到一个可令人难以信服的
you'd be pretty hard-pressedto find an incredible

670
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,710
另外解释：物质是如何产生的
alternative explanationfor how things came to be.

671
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,390
好的，我能想像你对自己刚才说讲的很满意
Well, I imagine you'requite pleased with yourself.

672
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,900
我看到你在小心避免史蒂芬・霍金这个人
I see you've carefully avoidedthe fact that Stephen Hawking,

673
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,590
世界上最有名的科学家
the world's mostfamous scientist,

674
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,750
还有他也不是一个有神论者
and who is not a theist,

675
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,310
最近出来赞同一个自我设计的宇宙
has recently come out in favorof a self-designing universe.

676
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,910
我没有回避，我只是没有 -
I haven't avoided it,I just didn't--

677
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,350
你只是不知道这件事.
You just didn'tknow about it.

678
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,020
嗯..好吧，让我们来看看霍金教授，
Alright, well let's seewhat Professor Hawking,

679
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,350
这位剑桥大学的“卢卡斯”物理教授（为剑桥大学的一个荣誉职位，授予对象为数理相关的研究者，同一时间只授予一人）
Lucasian Professor of physicsat Cambridge,

680
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,830
占据了由艾萨克・牛顿爵士曾持有的头把教学椅
who occupies a teaching chaironce held by Sir lsaac Newton,

681
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,600
不得不说一下宇宙的起源
has to say aboutthe origin of the universe.

682
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,950
那么，我引述下：“因为万有引力等定律，
And I quote, "Becausethere's a law such as gravity,

683
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,190
宇宙可以并会从无到有，自发形成.
"the universe can and willcreate itself from nothing.

684
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,230
自发创造可以解释
"Spontaneous creationis the reason

685
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,670
宇宙中并非无物存在、
"there is somethinginstead of nothing.

686
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,590
为什么宇宙存在以及为什么我们存在.
"It's why the universe exists,why we exist.

687
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,150
这就没必要借助上帝在其中
"lt is not necessaryto invoke God

688
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,830
来推动宇宙的运转
to set the universein motion."

689
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,550
引述完毕
End of quote.

690
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,390
那么，你可以从来没有发现过他的论点
So, you may have nevercome across his comment,

691
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,990
但他的观点依然存在
but his point remains.

692
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,950
你怎么回答？
How do you answer?.

693
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,110
我不知道
I don't know.

694
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,390
你不知道？
You don't know?.

695
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,310
我把你整个论点给推翻了
I prick the balloonof your entire argument

696
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,270
只用了一个很简单的方式，你不知道吗？
with a single pin,and you don't know?.

697
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,270
呵呵
Huh.

698
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,900
嗯，我的意思是：我想告诉你我有完美的答案
Well, I mean, I'd like to tellyou I have the perfect answer,

699
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,270
但它不会动摇我最基本的信心
but it doesn't shakemy underlying faith.

700
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,110
好了，因此那些在历史中最伟大科学们的思想
Okay, so the greatest scientificmind in all of history says

701
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,310
上帝不是必要的,但 一个大一新生在第一学期说：
that God is not necessary, buta first-semester freshman says,

702
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,510
“哦，是的，k是.”
"Oh, yes he is."

703
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,060
哇，你知道，那会是一个真正艰难的选择
Wow, you know, that's gonnabe a really tough choice.

704
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,550
好吧，我期待在下周的讲座（与大家再见）
Well, I look forwardto next week's lecture.

705
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,180
下课
Class is dismissed.

706
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,270
你认为你比我聪明，惠顿？
Do you think you'resmarter than me, Wheaton?.

707
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,110
你认为你提出的任何论点
Do you think there'sany argument you can make

708
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,310
我不会有一个答案？
that I won'thave an answer for?.

709
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,910
我从来没有说过我比你聪明
I never saidI was smarter.

710
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,790
这是你迄今为止说过最为有智慧的话
That's the firstintelligent thing you've said.

711
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,110
现在，我想明确这一点
Now, I want tomake this clear.

712
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,270
在那个教室里，有一个神，
In that classroom,there is a god,

713
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,110
是的，我就k
and yep, I'm him.

714
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,510
我也是一个忌邪的神，所以不要试图羞辱我
I'm also a jealous god,so do not try to humiliate me

715
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,670
在我的学生面前.
in front of my students.

716
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,710
你知道，我还调查了你所申报的专业
You know, I also checked upon your declared major.

717
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,390
法律预科？
Pre-law?.

718
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,110
法律预科究竟是什么？
What exactly is pre-law?.

719
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,750
那个东东我们不授予学位的
We don't awarddegrees in that.

720
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,950
不要打扰我的回答，但你要知道这一点
Don't bother answering,but know this,

721
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,230
假如你真的还想继续这猜字谜游戏
if you truly feel a needto continue with the charade,

722
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,590
我将通过我个人的努力
I will make it my personalmission to destroy any hope

723
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,670
把你未来的法律学位扼杀掉
of a law degreein your future.

724
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,750
祝你有美好的一天
Have a nice day.

725
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,550
- 你做了，不是吗？- 什么？
- You did it, didn't you?.- What?.

726
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,190
你知道我在说什么.
You know whatI'm talking about.

727
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,990
你去了， 而且还辩论，不是吗？
You went and did yourargument, didn't you?.

728
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,990
是的，是我做了
Yeah, yeah I did.

729
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,670
你想去证明什么？
What were youtrying to prove?.

730
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,510
我甚至不能用言语来形容
I'm not even surethere are words to describe

731
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,150
我现在的感受
what I'm feeling right now.

732
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,950
对不起乔什，我们俩之间结束了
I'm sorry Josh,but it's over between us.

733
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,270
就这样？刚刚- 已经结束了？
That's it?.It's just--it's over?.

734
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,430
一切都结束了，乔什.
It's over, Josh.

735
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,470
如果你继续做这些愚蠢和自私的事
If you're going to do somethingthis stupid and selfish

736
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,110
我其实已经告诉你将会发生什么
after I already told youwhat would happen--

737
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,590
是的，那件事是有道理的，不是吗？
Yeah, but that's sort ofthe point, isn't it?.

738
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,750
这一点对我来说却很重要，对吧
This is something that'simportant to me, right,

739
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,430
不过对你来说却并不重要
but since it's notimportant to you,

740
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,710
你在我们中间只设置了成功与失败的选项
you made it a make-it-or-break-it-thing for us.

741
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,550
你没问我，你只是告知我
You didn't ask me,you told me.

742
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,350
这不是一个我们做出的决定
It wasn't a decisionthat we made,

743
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,990
这不是一个你为我们俩共同做出的决定
it was a decision thatyou made for the both of us.

744
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,030
那么，总要有人去做（决定）
Well, somebody had to.

745
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,830
好
Okay.

746
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,150
就这样？ “好”？
That's it?. "Okay"?.

747
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,030
这不是我想要的
It's not what I want.

748
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,750
老实说，我仍然希望你会改变你的想法，好不
Honestly, I'm still hopingyou'll change your mind, right,

749
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,550
这件事，我必须要去做
but I have todo this thing.

750
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,790
我总感觉是上帝呼召我去做（这件事）
I feel like it's somethingthat God wants me to do.

751
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,830
我不能转身逃离，尤其是现在，更不行
I can't just turn away from it,especially not now,

752
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,990
现在，我已经开始做了
now that I've started.

753
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,270
关于你，我母亲说的太对了
My mother wasso right about you.

754
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,230
我只希望我能听到一丝有意义的话
I just wishI'd had the sense to listen.

755
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:27,990

762
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,390
告诉女孩她的人生意义和目的
Showed that girl she hadmeaning and a purpose to life

763
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,070
为了避免她沉沦
o b

764
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,070
你会向她宣扬真理，还是任其活在谎言中
Would you tell her the truthor let her live in a lie?.

765
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,710
这一切都可以改变
It all just seems to change

766
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,070
当你所见时，你要去拯救失丧的生命

(preaching)1 Corinthians saysyou're saved,

768
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,910
基督照圣经所说，为我们的罪死了，
and Christ died for our sinsaccording to the Scriptures,

769
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,710

第三天复活了
according to the Scriptures.

771
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,030
如果你真心相信
If you believe thisin your heart,

772
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,710
如果你凭信心接受
if you accept this by faith,

773
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,550
要知道，上帝会赦免你的过犯，（用宝血）洁净你
you see, God will forgive you,he'll cleanse you,

774
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,390

是的，但你改变了我们的约定

797
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,950
你破坏了我们之间的协议
you're breaking our deal.

798
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,760
你让这听起来像一个合同谈判

Love is the most overused wordin the English language.

803
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,870
我们想要的一些东西的时候，会说这话
It's what we saywhen we want something,

804
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,470
当我们需要一些东西
when we need something,

805
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,070
你也应该跟其他人一样感到内疚才是
and you're as guilty of itas anybody.

806
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,990
我们在一起挺有乐趣的
We had fun.

807
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,830
你是我狂热，年轻的女友，还有份别致的工作
You were my hot, younggirlfriend with the chic job.

808
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,190
我是你引导你进入上流社会、迷人、成功的男友
I was your upwardly mobile,charming, successful boyfriend.

809
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,550
我们在一起，因为我们彼此
And we were togetherbecause we each got something

810
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,550
在这关系上得到了想要的东西
out of the relationshipthat we wanted,

811
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,430
这很好
and it was good.

812
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,310
这是 -实际上，也挺让人满意的
It was--actually, it was great.

813
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,870
不过，现在这些都已经结束了
But now it's over.

814
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,350
我怎么没发现你是这样的人？
How did I notsee this in you?.

815
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,790
因为你只看到你想看到的
Because you sawwhat you wanted.

816
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,620
你明白我可能会死吗？
You understandthat I might die?.

817
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,910
我只能说，对此我很遗憾
And I'm sorry about that.

818
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,880
嘿，你是我哲学课的同学
Hey, you're inmy philosophy class.

819
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,590
马丁，对不？
Martin, right?.

820
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,950
正确，那么你是乔什先生
Correct,and you're Mr. Josh.

821
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,590
是啊

00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,030
是啊，这就是我，乔什先生
Yeah, that's me,Mr. Josh.

823
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,870
嘿，那些都在我们的阅读清单上吗？
Hey, is that onour reading list?.

824
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,350
不是的
No.

825
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,270
我可以问你一个问题吗？
Can I ask youa question?.

826
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,110
好的，当然可以
Yeah, sure.

827
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:34,270
为什么你要做你正在做的那些事？
Why are you doingwhat you are doing?.

828
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,390
其他的人都认为我疯了
Everyone elsethinks I'm crazy.

829
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,630
我的女友 -前女友为这事离开我
My girlfriend--ex-girlfriend left me over it.

830
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,110
我的父母也不希望我去冒这个险
My parentsdon't want me to risk it.

831
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,710
在这一切结束时
At the end of it all,

832
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,350
在接下来的学期中
I'm gonna have towork like a dog

833
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,990
我必须要忙得像条狗一样
for the rest of the semester

834
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,350
只是为了让我的其他课能赶得上
just to catch upon my other classes.

835
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,190
你描述你目前的困难
You have describedyour difficulties,

836
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,190
但你还没有回答我所问的问题“为什么”
but you haven't answeredmy question of why.

837
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,830
我不知道
I don't know.

838
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,950
我只是 - 我认为耶稣是我的朋友
I just--I think of Jesusas my friend.

839
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,390
那么，你觉得耶稣是上帝？
So, you think Jesus is God?.

840
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,790
是的，是上帝的儿子
Yeah, and the Son of God.

841
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,430
我不想令他失望
I don't wantto disappoint him,

842
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,990
即使每个人都认为我应该---
even if everyonethinks I should.

843
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,310
看，对我来说，他并没有死
See, to me,he's not dead.

844
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,510
k一直活着
He's alive.

845
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,950
我不希望任何人被劝服不相信k
I don't want anyone to gettalked out of believing in him

846
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,750
仅仅是因为一些教授认为他们应该（这样）
just because some professorthinks they should.

847
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,350
回头见，马丁
See you around, Martin.

848
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,990
再见

852
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,590
我是否需要签什么字？
Do I need to sign something?.

853
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,390
那肯定要的，我正在把一辆车给你

854
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,190
在这里签字

855
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,910
然后在那里签个字，那里再签个字

00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,630


862
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,230
你没有跟我开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

863
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,070


864
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,710
你做了什么？你把它弄坏了？
What did you do?.Did you break it?.

865
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,350
什么？
What?.

866
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,670
检查，看看它是否还挂着档
Check and seeif it's still in gear.

867
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,310
没有，在停车档
No, it's in park.

868
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,710
我搞不明白，它5分钟之前还能动的
I don't understand.It worked 5 minutes ago.

869
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,110
好了，那么，现在真的不行
Alright,well, now it's not.

870
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,830
你们多久才能把另一辆车给我们？
How soon can youget us another car?.

871
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,470
不过，今晚真的不行了
Well, not tonight.

872
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,190
现在已经过了下午5：30了
It's already after 5:30.

873
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,830
大家都回家了
Everyone's gone home

874
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,150
我今晚的试镜会晚到一点
and I'm already kind of latefor an audition.

875
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,790
试镜？
An audition?.

876
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,190
是啊，那帮家伙和我正在排练“推销员之死”
Yeah, the gang and lare doing "Death of a Salesman"

877
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,310
有几分像晚宴剧场差不多
and it's kind ofa dinner theatre thing.

878
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,830
“保证满意”成了什么了？
What happenedto satisfaction guaranteed?.

879
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,070
没事，大卫.我们可以明天启程
It's alright, David.We can leave tomorrow.

880
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,550
是你想开这真趟车的，而且已经错过了半天？
You want to make this driveand miss half the day?.

881
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,590
也许将会下雨呢
Perhaps it'sgonna rain anyway.

882
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,830
预测明日温度华氏82（摄氏28度），上午9点会阳光明媚
Forecast for tomorrowis 82 and sunny at 9 a.m.

883
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,870
有时候你很通情达理
Sometimes youdon't make any sense.

884
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,110
有时候你太在乎
Sometimes you make too much.

885
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,390
请记住，上帝是良善的

886
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,030
一直

00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,630
一直？

上帝是良善的

889
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,910
请你帮忙签下字拒绝接收这辆车吧？

890
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,590


891

你是在与马克（通话）
You're on with Marc.

892
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,070
是我，白痴，你的妹妹

893
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,270
哦，怎么了？
Oh, and this is about?.

894
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,870
你真的应该去看看妈妈
You reallyshould go see Mom.

895
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,510
她并不怎么好
She's not doing well.

896
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,150
她不怎么好已经好多年了
She hasn't beendoing well for years.

897
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,750
这就是为什么他们称之为老年痴呆症
That's why theycall it dementia.

898
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,390
不过，你还是应该去看看她
Still, you shouldgo see her.

899
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,310
克莱尔说你已经很长一段时间没去那里了
Claire said you haven'tbeen there in awhile.

900
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,950
这有什么关系啊
Like it matters?.

901
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,190
还有，我刚刚给她买了台新电视机
Besides, I justbought her a new TV.

902
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,950
听我说，我跟你达成一个交易
Look, I'll make you a deal.

903
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,190
你去，问她3+3等多少
You go and you ask herwhat 3 + 3 equals.

904
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,960
如果她能说出正确答案，我会去看她的
If she gives you theright answer, I'll visit.

905
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,590
这不公平
That's not fair.

906
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,190
生活本就是不公平的，我要挂电话了
Life's not fair.I gotta go.

907
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,830
帮我向艾米问声好
Say hi to Amy.

908
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,470
不行，我跟她已经结束了
No, that's over.

909
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,070
你做了什么？
What'd you do?.

910
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,910
不能解决的个人问题
Unresolved personal issues.

911
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,190
她得到了一些东西，她也要学会去经历
She's got some stuffshe's gotta work through.

912
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,950
我很遗憾听到这个消息
I'm sorry to hear that.

913
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,310
好吧，就是这样
Well, that'sthe way it goes.

914
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,150
好了，我们开始吧？
Okay, ready toget this started?.

915
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,590


916
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,470
说真的，你应该要有自己的生活
Seriously, youhave got to get a life.

917
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,140
是啊，请告诉我
Y eah, tell me about it.

918
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,550
嘿，亲爱的

919
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,310
哦，对不起，门是开着的
Oh, sorry,the door was open.

920
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,510
我只让自己进来了哦

921
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,310
- 嗨- 嗨

922
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,190
嘿，我要的那瓶葡萄酒拿了伐？

923
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,110
我拿了

924
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,390
我把它落在车上

00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,990
它是在车上

926
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,830
不用担心它

927
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,470
你已经花很多时间在准备就餐了

928
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,110
所以，你知道，只是 -

929
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,830
非常感谢你帮我们准备好了晚宴

930
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,950
好了，除非我错了
Well, unless I'm wrong,

931
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,070
所有的客人都是哲学系的？
all the guests are fromthe philosophy department?.

932
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,390
还真不是，薇薇安是一个社会学家
That's not true.Vivian's a sociologist.

933
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,990
你证明了我的观点
You're proving my point.

934
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,070
你看，我其实帮不了忙
Look, I can't help it.

935
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,390
你看，我在你身边的时候
See, my intellectual rigorfalls to pieces

936
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,470
我的理性掉了一地
the instantI get around you.

937
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,070
真的吗？
Really?.

938
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,750
你肯定在逗我玩
You could have fooled me.

939
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,310
我第一次走进教室时
The first time I walkedinto your classroom,

940
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,310
你是满有血性与冲劲
you were allblood and thunder.

941
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:14,310
那只是一个表演，很大程度上只是为了吸引你
That was a performance,staged largely for your benefit.

942
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:19,590
在此同时，我一直试图让我的眼睛离开你
In the mean time, I kepttrying to keep my eyes off you

943
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,710
并希望有这个漂亮的脑袋里充满了智慧
and hoping that there wasa brain inside that pretty head.

944
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,350
为什么呢？
Why?.

945
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,270
嗯，因为，如果没有，那么，你知道，
Well, because if there wasn't,then, you know,

946
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,430
我没有办法让自己和你一起出去
there's no way I could havemade myself go out with you.

947
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,910
你知道的，正因为如此，我一直等到你以高分通过期中考试
Look, as it was, I waiteduntil you aced the midterm.

948
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,550
这是一个A减
It was an A-minus.

949
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,220
很接近了
Close enough.

950
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,750
来吧，她去那里了
Come on, where is she?.

951
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,390
咦？
Huh?.

952
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,990
谁？
Who?.

953
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,990
那无忧无虑，自由奔放的女孩
That carefree,free-spirited girl

954
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:58,500
我几乎冒着自己的职业生涯风险跟她约会的那位
who forced me to almostrisk my career by dating her.

955
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,180
你知道，是那位在引述艾米莉・狄金森（美国传奇女诗人）、雪莱
You know, the one who quotedEmily Dickinson, and Shelley,

956
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,310
和海绵宝宝时都保持同样自信的她
and Spongebob Squarepantswith equal self-confidence.

957
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,950
我的意思是，在过去的米娜身上发生了什么呢？
I mean, what ever happenedto the old Mina?.

958
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,350
因为我很想念她
'Cause I miss her.

959
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,750
她的母亲正在一天天衰残
She has got a momwho's failing,

960
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,990
她感触到时间在飞奔流逝
she's sensingtime is passing by,

961
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:24,910
并且她开始怀疑与他是非能同负一轭
and she's starting to wonderif she's unequally yoked.

962
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,430
那么，是不是又读了一遍（圣经）？
Alright, you've beenreading again, haven't you?.

963
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,790
读经、听道、思想
Reading, listening,thinking.

964
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,590
你很难称之为思想
You can hardlycall this thinking.

965
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,550
事实上，它是站在思想的对立面的
As a matter of fact,it's the opposite of thinking.

966
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,990
你知道我是一个基督徒
You know I'm a Christian.

967
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,830
你第一次开始看到我时其实就知道了
You knew that whenyou first started seeing me.

968
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,990
是的，但你也知道我不是
Yes, and you knowthat I'm not.

969
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,590
是啊，我知道，
Yeah, I know,

970
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,230
我知道有很多东西
and I knowthere's a lot of things

971
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,870
你不想去谈
you don't wantto talk about,

972
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,470
所以我们不谈论它们
so we don'ttalk about them.

973
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,550
是啊，除了从静默开始变得越来
Yeah, except the not talkingis starting to get louder

974
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,910
越响，后来很快就会震耳欲聋之外
and louder, and soonit will be deafening,

975
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:06,630
我也不知道我是否可以忍受
and I don't knowif I can put up with that.

976
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,910
- 我知道- 你呢？- 是啊
- I know.- Do you?.- Yeah.

977
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,500
因为我们需要明确这一点
Because we needto be clear on this.

978
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,990
在这个房间里只有我们两个人的关系
There's only roomin this relationship for two,

979
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,630
这意味着我不去找一个情妇
which meansI don't get a mistress

980
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,670
你也不要拖着2000多岁的死木匠不放
and you don't get to drag a2,000-year-old dead carpenter

981
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,710
把流动的拉比变成我们的生活
turned itinerant rabbiinto our lives.

982
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,750
就这样吧，我要去梳洗一下
Look, I'm gonnago freshen up.

983
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,550
这是同一辆车？
Is this the same car?.

984
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,270
哦，不，先生不，先生
Oh, no sir.No, sir.

985
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,030
同一型号，不同的颜色.
Same model,different color.

986
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,670
另一辆是赤霞红
The other onewas a cabernet.

987
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,470
这是云母红色
This is moreof a merlot.

988
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,550
你知道，说谎可不好
You know,lying's not good.

989
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,470
骗一位被按立的牧师，就是彻头彻尾的坏
Lying to an ordained ministeris flat-out bad.

990
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,070
你知道的，对吧？
You know that, right?.

991
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,430
先生，我向你保证，这是确定是一辆不同的汽车
Sir, I assure you this isa different automobile.

992
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,390
（钥匙）在这里，试下吧
Here, try it out.

993
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,310
你试镜试的怎么样了？
How'd your audition go?.

994
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,950
呵呵，还不错
Oh, pretty good.

995
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:14,150
我打算扮演“比夫”所以 - 谢谢你的关心
I'm up for the role of Biff,so--thanks for asking.

996
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:26,270


997
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,310
你们要去哪里？
You guys going somewhere?.

998
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,430
你要担任系主任职位的那个事情怎么样了？
How's it look for you withthe department chair position?.

999
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,630
这学期期中将会复审
I'm up for reviewmid-semester.

1000
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,830
鲍威尔院长向我保证这是一个扣篮（系主任职位属我）
Dean Powell assures meit's a slam dunk.

1001
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,790
不错，恭喜了，杰弗里
Well, congratulations Jeffrey.

1002
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,110
什么都在你的盘子里（掌控之中）？
Anything elseon your plate?.

1003
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,190
并不是的
Not really.

1004
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,070
可否分享下？
Feel like sharing?.

1005
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,870
在我本学期的入门课程中有这样一位学生
I've got this student in myintroductory class this semester

1006
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,590
那个谁---好吧他采取了挑战（措施）
who's--well,he's taken a challenge

1007
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,550
为了证明上帝的存在
to provethe existence of God.

1008
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,150
在您的课堂上？
In your classroom?.

1009
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,110
- 是的.- 傻小子
- Yes.- Silly boy.

1010
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,430
- 大一新生？- 是的
- Freshman?.- Oh yeah.

1011
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,550
我觉得这似乎很不公平
Doesn't seemquite fair to me.

1012
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,150
那么，那会是怎样的？
Well, how's that?.

1013
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,430
他在讲台上是缺乏经验的
He's inexperiencedin front of a room,

1014
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,030
而你希望他与你竞争
and you're expecting himto compete with you

1015
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,830
在自己的专业领域
in your own fieldof expertise.

1016
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,310
得了吧，米娜，这对我来说很有趣
Come on, Mina.This is fun for me.

1017
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,190
如果一个男孩想让自己出丑还有学术自杀
I can't help it if a boywants to make a fool of himself

1018
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,310
我也是爱莫能助啊
and commit academic suicide.

1019
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,950
听着，我已试图阻止过他
Look, I tried to stop him.

1020
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,750
我给了他一条出路但是不，不，不
I gave him an out,but no, no, no,

1021
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,560
他想证明上帝没死
he wants to provethat God isn't dead.

1022
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,470


1023
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,750
你看，我知道我在这里，就是一个少数族裔
Look, I know I amin the minority here,

1024
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,710
但事实上，我信仰上帝
but I actuallybelieve in God.

1025
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,910
是，是，好吧，她是 -她还是处于进化之中
Yes, yes, well, she is--she's a work in progress.

1026
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,550


1027
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,910
所以，亲爱的，我认为我们最好还是转移下话题
So, darling, I think it's bestwe just change the subject.

1028
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,550
但我只是说 -
But I'm just saying--

1029
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,710
米娜，我礼貌地问，好吗？
Mina, I've askedpolitely, okay?.

1030
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,430
好
Okay.

1031
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,790
红酒烹嫩炸鸡（法式菜）快要好了
The coq au vinis almost done.

1032
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,710
做的好
Excellent.

1033
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,630
饭厅
T o the dining room.

1034
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,590
一点也不像正宗的墨尔乐干红葡萄酒挂杯效果
Nothing like a nice merlotto take the edge off.

1035
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,510
大家一起干杯
Cheers, everyone.

1036
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,470
米娜，这酒很不对
Mina, this wine is awful.

1037
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,110
品起来，像煮熟过的感觉
It's been cooked.

1038
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,150
它的味道就像是晒在发霉的地下室
It tastes like it wassunning in a moldy basement.

1039
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,110
谈论下你的《愤怒的葡萄》（美国诺贝尔奖约翰・斯坦贝克斯坦贝克代表作）
Talk about your"Grapes of Wrath."

1040
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,630


1041
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,870
我前几天购物之前已经买好了酒
I bought it beforeI went shopping the other day.

1042
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,950
我回家之后
I locked it in the trunk

1043
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,870
忘记把酒锁在汽车后备箱中了
and when I got homeI forgot about it.

1044
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,590
嗯，我想这顿晚餐将作为一个宝贵的教训
Well, I think this dinnerserves as a valuable lesson.

1045
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,180
正如苏格拉底在两千多年前所说
As Socrates put itover 2,000 years ago,

1046
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,150
“Gnothi seauton.”（古希腊语，意思为认识你自己）
"Gnothi seauton."

1047
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,510
此古希腊语恰好适合她
Looks likeit's Greek to her.

1048
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,710
哦,这是“认识你自己”意思, 亲爱的,请认识你自己
Oh, it's "Know thyself,"darling, know thyself.

1049
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,190
我认为其中意思是要认知到自己的局限性
Which I suggest meansknowing your own limitations.

1050
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:06,070
不好意思，很抱歉
You know,if you'll all excuse me,

1051
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,230
我帮不上什么忙
it's time forthe help to depart.

1052
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,270
甜心
Sweetheart

1053
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:28,310


1054
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:41,990


1055
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,950
有没心脏起搏器？
No pacemaker?.

1056
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,350
其他的穿孔，也没吧？
No other piercings, right?.

1057
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,950
是的
No.

1058
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,580
这听起来似乎很离奇，不过，我还是要问
I know it sounds crazy,but I have to ask.

1059
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,430
你身体内有没有金属物
If there's any ferrous metalanywhere inside your body,

1060
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,230
因金属会受强大磁场的吸引而移动的
the magnetic fieldwill put it out, and forcibly.

1061
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:06,510


1062
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,550
在上节课，我被问了一个问题
In our last class,I was asked a question

1063
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,360
当时我回答不出来
that I couldn't answer.

1064
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,940
雷森迪教授指出
As Professor Radissonpointed out,

1065
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,070
斯蒂芬・霍金是一个无神论者
Stephen Hawking is an atheist.

1066
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,910
他还写了本叫“大设计”的书
He also wrote a bookcalled "The Grand Design"

1067
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:22,750
他在书里是这么说的：
in which he saysthe following:

1068
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,070
因为万有引力等定律，
"Because there is a lawsuch as gravity,

1069
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,670
宇宙可以并会从无到有，自发形成.
the universe can and willcreate itself from nothing."

1070
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,390
而说实话，当时我不知道该如何反驳这一点
And to be honest, I didn'tknow how to refute that.

1071
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:40,390
我的意思是，毕竟，霍金是一个天才
I mean, after all,Hawking is clearly a genius.

1072
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,060
但是，教数学和哲学的
But, Professor John Lennox,

1073
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,670
兰.约翰教授（牛津大学教学）
who teaches mathematicsand philosophy

1074
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,630
已经剖析过，那个简单的句子中
has demonstrated thatthere are not one, even two,

1075
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,030
不至存在一个，
but three errorsof logic contained

1076
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,710
甚至二个、三个逻辑误区.
in that one simple sentence,

1077
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,540
而且这些都仅基于循环论证.
and it all boils downto circular reasoning.

1078
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,320
霍金基本上是说，宇宙存在
Hawking is basically sayingthat the universe exists

1079
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,710
是因为宇宙需要存在，
because the universeneeded to exist,

1080
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,310
并且因为宇宙需要存在，
and because the universeneeded to exist,

1081
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,430
因此，它自我创造.
it therefore created itself.

1082
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,030
打个比方
It's like this.

1083
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,870
如果我告诉你，我可以证明
If I say to youthat I can prove

1084
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,990
午餐肉是有史以来最好吃的食物
that Spam is the best-tastingfood that's ever existed

1085
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,590
是因为在历史中，没有食物曾有过更好的味道
because in all of history,no food has ever tasted better,

1086
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,230
你可能会奇怪的看着我
you'd probablylook at me strange

1087
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,830
并说我还没有证明过任何事.
and say I haven'tproven anything.

1088
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,470
而你说这是对的
And you'd be right,

1089
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,790
你说做的一切只是在重申原来的主张
all I've done isrestate my original claim.

1090
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,790
而霍金声称，宇宙的自我创造
But when Hawking claimsthat the universe created itself

1091
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,190
是因为它需要自我创造
because it neededto create itself,

1092
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,230
然后提出关于它自我创造的原因
and then offers thatas an explanation

1093
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,510
与自我创造的方式
as to howand why it was created,

1094
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,910
我们不会立即承认他在做同样的事情.
we don't immediately recognizethat he's doing the same thing.

1095
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,270
不过他确实是的.对此，兰作了进一步的剖析
But he is, promptingLennox to further comment,

1096
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,950
“废话依然废话，
"Nonsense remains nonsense,

1097
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,870
“即使是由著名科学家讲
"even when spokenby famous scientists

1098
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,550
“即使一般公众
"even thoughthe general public

1099
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,150
假定这些是科学的声称
assumes they arestatements of science."

1100
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,870
这太目中无人了
This is the height of hubris.

1101
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,510
你是不是想说，你一个大一新生
Are you telling methat you, a freshman,

1102
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,590
想说斯蒂芬・霍金是错误的？
are saying thatStephen Hawking is wrong?.

1103
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,910
不是我说，是兰.约翰说的.
No, what I'm sayingis that John Lennox,

1104
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,550
一位数学和哲学教授，
a professor of mathematicsand philosophy,

1105
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,710
他发现霍金教授的推理是错误的，
has found Professor Hawking'sreasoning to be faulty,

1106
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,510
我同意他的逻辑论点.
and I agree with his logic.

1107
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,180
但如果你不能忍受不同意
But if youcan't bear to disagree

1108
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,790
霍金的思想
with Hawking's thinking,

1109
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,270
那么我建议你翻到他书的第5页
then I suggest that youturn to page five of his book,

1110
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,310
在书上，他坚持“哲学已死”，
where he insistsphilosophy is dead.

1111
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,830
如果你如此确信
And if you're so sure

1112
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,430
霍金教授绝无错误
of Professor Hawking'sinfallibility,

1113
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,070
和哲学真的已死.
and philosophyreally is dead,

1114
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:22,110
那么好，这门课程其实也真的没必要了.
then well, there's reallyno need for this class.

1115
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,550
我就像他的便利设施
It's likeI'm a convenience to him,

1116
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,320
当我满有信心时，
except for whenmy faith comes up,

1117
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,470
他就变成恶语中伤.
then he becomesverbally abusive.

1118
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,710
我猜他挺聪明的，
I'm guessing he's bright.

1119
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,350
才华横溢.
Brilliant.

1120
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,070
英俊.
Handsome.

1121
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,670
是的.
Yes.

1122
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,340
他的重视，使你感到特别，
And his attentionmakes you feel special,

1123
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,830
给了你很满足的感觉.
gives you a senseof completeness.

1124
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,430
你有没有看我的日记？
Have you beenreading my diary?.

1125
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,070
心理学家称之为灰姑娘情结.
Psychologists call itthe Cinderella complex.

1126
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,030
这不是我命名的，所以不要生我气.
It's not my name for it,so don't get upset with me.

1127
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,510
男人们在方面也一样
Guys are capableof the same thing.

1128
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,790
只不过他们没有为这个命名而已.
It's just they don'thave a name for it.

1129
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,470
但在本质上，你的自我价值感
But in essence,you're looking for his approval

1130
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,070
是建立在他的认同上的.
to give youa sense of self-worth

1131
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,310
而不是源自你自己的自我认知.
instead ofgenerating it internally.

1132
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,150
是不是大多数人也都这样呢？
Don't most people do that?.

1133
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,740
是啊，肯定有很多人是这样的.
Y eah, a lotof people do, sure.

1134
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,590
但是，自我形像建立在浪漫上
But, using romanceto shore up self-image

1135
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,470
是一种不稳定的根基.
is an unstable foundation.

1136
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,910
你相信神会犯错、有偏见、不公义？
Do you believe God's capableof error, bias, or bad judgment?.

1137
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,550
不相信
No.

1138
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,470
因此，他不会做错事.
So, if he's incapableof mistakes,

1139
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,670
你是按照k的形像和样式而造的（创世记1：26）
and he made youin his likeness and image,

1140
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,390
这显明k在乎你，对不对？
then it follows that hecares about you, right?.

1141
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,310
对的.
Right.

1142
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,990
到一个地步，上帝的独生子
To the pointwhere God's only Son

1143
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,550
为你甘愿被钉在十字架上，只是为你
would willingly be crucifiedagain for you, just you,

1144
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,590
这对你来说，还不足够
if that's whatwas necessary.

1145
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,300
那么，假如k是如此爱你
Well, if heloves you that much,

1146
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,830
才不要在乎你的男友是如何认为？
who cares whatyour boyfriend thinks?.

1147
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:51,710
如果是错的那个人，你永远不会有任何价值.
T o the wrong person,you'll never have any worth.

1148
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:58,630
但是如果是对的那人个，你就意味着一切.
But to the right person,you'll mean everything.

1149
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,460
女士们，先生们的陪审团，
Ladies and gentlemenof the jury,

1150
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,750
在过去的150年间，达尔文主义一直在说
for the last 1 50 years,Darwinists have been saying

1151
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,590
在解释人的存在时，上帝是不必要的
that God is unnecessaryto explain man's existence

1152
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,180
而进化论可取代上帝，
and that evolutionreplaces God,

1153
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,270
但进化论只是告诉你生命拥有后
but evolution onlytells you what happens

1154
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,190
发生了什么.
once you have life.

1155
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,550
那么，生物是从何而来？
So, where did that somethingthat's alive come from?.

1156
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,870
其实，达尔文从来没有真正解决这个问题.
Well, Darwinnever really addressed it.

1157
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,230
他假设是闪电刚好击中了
He assumed maybe somelightning hit a stagnant pool

1158
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,870
一些合适的化学物
full of the right kindof chemicals

1159
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,510
好极了，一个活生生的生命产生了.
and bingo,a living something.

1160
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,150
但它只是没有那么简单.
But it's just not that simple.

1161
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,470
你看，达尔文声称，所有生物的祖先
You see, Darwin claimed that theancestry of all living things

1162
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,870
都来自那一个单一的，简单的生物体
came from that onesingle, simple organism

1163
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,430
再经过长时间的变异
which reproduced andwas slowly modified over time

1164
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,790
形成我们现在看到的复杂的生命体.
into the complex life formswe view today.

1165
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,750
这些都是他沉思后的学说
Which is why, aftercontemplating his own theory,

1166
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,310
达尔文所说的名言：
Darwin utteredhis famous statement,

1167
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,270
"Natura non facit saltum,"（拉丁文）
"Natura non facit saltum,"

1168
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:56,710
意思是“自然界并不进行突变式发展”
meaning,"Nature does not jump."

1169
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,950
著名的(基督徒)作家史特博.李指出
Well, as noted authorLee Strobel pointed out,

1170
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,190
你能想像这样一幅场境，科学家们
that if you can picturethe entire 3.8 billion years

1171
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,430
把整个38亿年历史浓缩为一天，
that scientists saylife has been around

1172
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,110
即24小时.
as one 24-hour day,

1173
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,780
至最后90秒时，
in the space ofjust about 90 seconds,

1174
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,990
开始闪现大多数主要现有动物形状
most major animal groupssuddenly appear

1175
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,630
动物群的身影
in the forms in whichthey currently hold.

1176
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,140
并不是达尔文预测的缓慢而稳定的（进化）
Not slowly and steadilyas Darein predicted,

1177
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,790
几乎是在瞬间.
but in evolutionary terms,almost instantly.

1178
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,990
因此，“自然界并不进行突变式发展”
So, "nature doesnot jump" becomes

1179
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,910
变成了“自然界产生一个巨大的飞跃”
"nature makesa giant leap."

1180
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,190
那么，有神论者如何解释这突如其来，
So, how do theistsexplain this sudden outburst

1181
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,750
开天辟地出现的新生物信息？
of new biological information?.

1182
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,590
神说：“水要多多滋生有生命的物，
"And God said, 'Let the waterteem with living creatures

1183
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,230
要有雀鸟飞在地面以上，
"'and let birdsfly above the earth

1184
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,990
天空之中.”（创世纪1：20）
across the expanseof the sky.'

1185
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,830
神就造出大鱼，
"So God created thegreat creatures of the sea

1186
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,430
和水中所滋生各样有生命的动物
"and every livingand moving thing with whichthe water teems

1187
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,110


1188
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,750
各从其类
"according to its kind.

1189
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:50,830
神看着是好的.（创世纪1：21）
And God saw that itwas good," Genesis 1 :20.

1190
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,590
换言之，创造发生了.
In other words,creation happened

1191
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,510
因为神说有就有,命立就立
because God saidit should happen.

1192
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,230
甚至在我们看来似乎是
And even what looks,to our eyes,

1193
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,990
盲目的、无目标的过程.
to be a blind,unguided process

1194
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:05,550
其实从开始到结束，真的是神在控制.
could really be divinelycontrolled from start to finish.

1195
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,750
有没有人和你一起来？
Isn't there anyone you'd liketo have here with you for this?.

1196
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,590
没有，没有其他人.
No, there's nobody.

1197
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,310


1198
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:05,110
谎言，谎言，和更多的谎言.
Lies, lies, and more lies.

1199
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,270
这容易忽视掉，到底你真的是不知道
It's easy to dismisswhat you don't understand

1200
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,230
还是你不想去知道
or what you don'twant to understand.

1201
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:15,070
答案应在那里，狂热的信徒所必备的装备
There it is, the defaultsetting of the Bible-thumper.

1202
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:19,390
“只有你打开圣经，读圣经，
"lf only you would openthe Scripture and read,

1203
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,470
那么你才会明白.
then you would understand."

1204
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:27,470
这些都是那个勇敢、年轻的大一新生所说.
So says thebrave young freshman.

1205
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:33,630
你们真是子民哪！你们死亡，智慧也就灭没了.
"For thou art wise, and withthou, all wisdom shall die,"

1206
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,670
(约伯记12章2节)
Job 1 2, verse 2.

1207
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,710
约伯另外还告诉我们什么？
What else does Job tell us?.

1208
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,430
人为妇人所生，日子短少，
"For man who is bornof woman is few of days,

1209
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,070
多有患难.（伯14:1 ）
"and full of trouble.

1210
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,910
飞去如影，不能存留.（伯14:2后半节）
"He comes forth like a shadowand does not continue.

1211
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:51,030
人也是如此，躺下不再起来.(伯14:12 )
"So man lies down,and does not rise

1212
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:54,390
等到天没有了 （伯14:12前半节）
'til the heavensare no more."

1213
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:00,310
好吧，至少他得到了那部分权利.
Well, at least hegot that part right.

1214
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,790
你身上到底发生了什么？
What happened to you?.

1215
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:16,630
当一个12岁大的（男孩）看到他那身患癌症，即将死去的母亲
When a 1 2-year-old watcheshis mother dying of cancer,

1216
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,750
很自然的为了母亲的生命向上帝乞求
it's only naturalto beg God for her life.

1217
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,910
他向那个虚幻的
He'll promise anything

1218
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,550
在天上的阿爸父许愿
to his make-believegrandfather in the sky,

1219
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,710
包括永远爱k、敬拜k.
including to loveand worship him forever,

1220
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:33,870
只要k饶过她.
if only he will spare her.

1221
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,430
有时候，答案是否定的.
Sometimes the answer is no.

1222
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,190
告诉我，有一天，你失去你所爱的人，你会怎么样.
Tell that to me the dayyou lose someone you love.

1223
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,230
她在相信那谎言中死去
She died believing a lie.

1224
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,430
她以为死了以后，在那里会有（上帝）爱她
She died believing thatsomeone out there loved her

1225
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,950
甚至在被k扼杀生命时，她还是怎么想的
even while he wasstrangling her to death.

1226
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:53,350
一个允许这事发生的上帝，根本不值得去相信
A God who would allow thatis not worth believing in.

1227
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:58,110
这就是为什么，惠顿，你会发现
That is why, Wheaton,you will find

1228
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:03,390
最坚定的无神论者曾经都是基督徒，
the most committed atheistswere once Christians,

1229
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,350
但我们对此却都视而不见.
but we tookthe blinders off.

1230
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:09,590
我们看到了世界的真实情况.
We saw the worldfor what it truly is.

1231
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,430
你看，莎士比亚说得对.
You see,Shakespeare had it right.

1232
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:17,750
“人生如痴人说梦，
Life is really a taletold by an idiot,

1233
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:23,630
充满着喧哗与骚动，却没有任何意义.”
full of sound and fury,and signifying nothing.

1234
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,910
阿依莎！
Ayisha!

1235
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:00,350
"k是独一的上帝，是非受生的！
"He's the one godwho has not begotten."

1236
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,630
说！
Say it!

1237
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,710
我命令你说！
I command you to say it!

1238
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,350
不，爸爸.
No, Baba.

1239
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,750
耶稣是我的主、我的拯救者，k为了救我脱离罪孽而受死.
Jesus is my Lord and Savior andhe died to save me from my sins.

1240
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,390
不！
No!

1241
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,390
因 我 知      演唱    特里西娅.布鲁克
Tricia Brock singing  "What I Know"

1242
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:19,590
信靠、信靠，
?Carry on, carry on?

1243
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:26,510
因我知祢是我的真神，
?What I know is you,my God, are real?

1244
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:33,750
不管我处何境，祢总不离弃我，
?No matter how I feel,you've never let me go?

1245
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:40,630
我且也知永不会有这天，
?And what I knowis there will never be a day?

1246
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,870
因你不只是单向我吹气的神.
?You aren'tjust a breath away?

1247
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:53,470
因经过这一切，我要保守我所知，
?And through it allI've gotta hold to what I know?

1248
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:59,590
更要保守我所知，
?Gonna holdto what I know?

1249
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:08,150
因我知，
?What I know?

1250
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,550
因我知.
?What I know?

1251
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,860
对延迟发表我的采访这事，很抱歉.
Sorry for the delayin posting my interview.

1252
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:03,110
这是艰难的一周.
It's been a rough week.

1253
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:09,470
什么都让我碰上了.
When I finally caught up to--

1254
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:16,270


1255
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:22,270
新头衔
New post.

1256
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:27,070
癌症患者.
I have cancer.

1257
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:34,150
艾米就要死了.
Amy is going to die.

1258
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:44,470


1259
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,230
不！
No!

1260
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:58,590


1261
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,310
杰弗里，我需要和你谈谈.
Jeffrey, I needto talk to you.

1262
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,990
你知道有些东西我很在乎的.
You know howI feel about that.

1263
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,550
在校园里，我是雷森迪教授，好吗？
On campus, I'mProfessor Radisson, okay?.

1264
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,430
那么，后来他就声称达而文所说的是错的.
So, then he claims that Dawkinsis the one who was in error,

1265
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,510
好像达尔文认为 -
as if Dawkins thought--

1266
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,260
杰弗里，我要离开你了.
Jeffrey, I'm leaving you.

1267
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,190
对不起 - 打扰一下.
Excuse me.

1268
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,070
什么？
What?.

1269
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,430
你说什么？
What are you saying?.

1270
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,430
我要离开你.
I'm leaving you.

1271
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,230
你不能这么做.
You can't do that.

1272
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,710
我是不会接受的.
I won't accept it.

1273
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,910
对不起.
I'm sorry.

1274
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,550
我说我不接受.
I said I don'taccept that.

1275
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,670
我不允许.
I won't allow it.

1276
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:23,020
我知道，我听见你说了，但这不是你说了算.
I know, I heard you,but it's not your choice.

1277
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,350
再见，杰弗里.
Good bye, Jeffrey.

1278
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,470
她隐藏信仰有多久了？
How long has shebeen hiding her faith?.

1279
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,230
大约一年.
About a year.

1280
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:54,190
我甚至不能想像她要承受什么
I can't even imaginewhat she must be feeling.

1281
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:01,470
这就是你的战壕 ，大卫.
You asked to bein the trenches, David.

1282
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,830
我在做什么，大卫牧师？
What have I done,Pastor Dave?.

1283
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,630
我已失去了一切.
I've lost everything.

1284
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,830
我做错了什么事情？
What if I madea mistake?.

1285
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,670
阿依莎，你已经展示出了惊人的勇气.
Ayisha, you've displayedan amazing amount of courage

1286
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,630
在你的信仰上站立起来了.
by standing upfor your faith.

1287
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:47,910
上帝知道你所承受的，k会记念这事的.
God knows the risks you've takenand he will honor that.

1288
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:53,550
我不认为我可以做到这一点.
I don't thinkI can do this.

1289
01:18:53,760 --> 01:19:00,100
阿依莎，我们都跟你在一起.
We're here for you,Ayisha.

1290
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:06,390
你 - 你读过保罗书信？
Are you - have you readof the Apostle Paul?.

1291
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,950
他说，我知道怎样处卑贱，(腓4：12-13）
He said, "l knowwhat it is to have little,

1292
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,110
也知道怎样处丰富.
and I know what it isto have plenty.

1293
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,880
随事随在，
ln any and all circum stances,

1294
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,070
我都得了秘诀.
l have learned the secretof being well-fed

1295
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,950
或饱足、或饥饿，
and of being hungry,

1296
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:24,350
或有余、或缺乏.
of having plent yand of being in need.

1297
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,950
凡事都能做.
I can do all things"

1298
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:31,070
我靠着那加给我力量的.
"Through Christ who strengthens me."

1299
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:35,100
是的.
Right.

1300
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,510
你并不孤单，阿依莎.
You're not alone, Ayisha.

1301
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,110
你会好起来的.
You're gonna be okay.

1302
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,830
我让你在我的课台上侃侃而谈，
I made a mistake with you,

1303
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,670
胡加宣传，
Ietting you speakin front of my classroom

1304
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,510
现在看来，对我来说意味着是一个错误.
and spewyour propaganda.

1305
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:41,270
但今天，我们要去改变一些规则
But today, we're gonnachange things up a bit.

1306
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:51,590
罪恶
Evil.

1307
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,990
现在,据说“ 罪恶”是无神论者攻击基督教信仰最有力的武器
Now, it's been said that evilis atheism's most potent weapon

1308
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,470
不过，确实也是如此.
against the Christian faith,and it is.

1309
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,470
毕竟，存在罪恶牵引出了另一个问题
After all, the very existenceof evil begs the question,

1310
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:05,750
如果上帝是全善、上帝是全能的，
"lf God is all-goodand God is all-powerful,

1311
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,150
怎么会允许罪恶存在？
why does he allowevil to exist?. "

1312
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:16,860
在其核心的答案是非常简单的，“自由意志”
The answer at its core isremarkably simple: free will.

1313
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,640
上帝允许罪恶产生，是因为“自由意志”
God allows evil to existbecause of free will.

1314
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,350
从基督教的角度来看，神容忍罪恶在这个世界上
From the Christian standpoint,God tolerates evil in this world

1315
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,190
是暂时的，有这样一天，
on a temporary basisso that one day,

1316
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,470
那些真正选择爱k的
those who chooseto love him freely

1317
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,870
将与k一同住在天堂，摆脱罪恶的轧制，
will dwell with him in heaven,free from the influence of evil,

1318
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,790
从而具有良性的自由意志.
but with theirfree will in tact.

1319
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,020
换句话说，上帝对罪恶的态度，
In other words,God's intention concerning evil

1320
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,870
就是有一天摧毁它.
is to one day destroy it.

1321
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,680
真好，太方便了.
Well, how convenient.

1322
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,550
“有一天，我将摆脱在世界上所有的罪恶.
"One day, I will get ridof all the evil in the world.

1323
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,710
“但在那之前，你只需要处理所有的战争，
"But until then, you just haveto deal with all the wars,

1324
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,580
“和大屠杀，海啸，贫困，饥饿，艾滋病.
"and Holocausts, tsunamis,poverty, starvation, and AlDS.

1325
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,710
美好的生活.
Have a nice life."

1326
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,630
接下来，他通过道德的绝对性来教育我们.
Next, he'll be lecturing uson moral absolutes.

1327
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,310
但是，为什么不呢？
But why not?.

1328
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,510
雷森迪教授，谁显然是一个无神论者，
Professor Radisson,who's clearly an atheist,

1329
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,110
不相信道德的绝对性，
doesn't believein moral absolutes,

1330
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,880
但他的核心教学大纲说，他计划在
but his core syllabus sayshe plans to give us an exam

1331
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,510
在最后一周对我们进行考试.
during finals week.

1332
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,710
现在，我敢说，如果我设法为了得到一个“A”
Now, I'm betting thatif I manage to get an "A"

1333
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,350
在考试中作弊，
on the exam by cheating,

1334
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,950
他就会突然用上基督徒的语调,说：
he'll suddenly startsounding like a Christian,

1335
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,590
坚持“欺骗是错误的”，
insisting it's wrongto cheat,

1336
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,230
我应该知道这点.
that I should haveknown that.

1337
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,000
然而，他的依据是什么？
And yet,what basis does he have?.

1338
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:23,150
如果我的所做所为，是为了帮助我成功
If my actions are calculatedto help me succeed,

1339
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,310
那么，为什么我不应该执行呢？
then why shouldn'tI perform them?.

1340
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,790
对于基督徒来说，道德的标准，
For Christians,the fixed point of morality,

1341
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,670
什么是对，什么是错，
what constitutesright and wrong,

1342
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:34,590
是一条直线，最终直接向上帝（负责)
is a straight linethat leads directly back to God.

1343
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,710
哦，所以你说，我们需要一个上帝是具有道德性的，
Oh, so you're saying thatwe need a God to be moral,

1344
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,270
一个无神论具有道德是不可能的.
that a moral atheistis an impossibility.

1345
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,940
不是的，但没有上帝，道德没有任何真正的意义.
No, but with no God, uu

1346
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,590
我的意思是，甚至不存在
I mean, there'snot even a standard

1347
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,270
道德行为的标准.
of what moral behavior is.

1348
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,310
对于基督徒来说，说谎，欺骗，偷窃 -
For Christians,lying, cheating, stealing--

1349
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,350
拿我举例，我偷拿了并非我自己赚取学分等级
in my example, stealinga grade I didn't earn--

1350
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,950
是被禁止的.
are forbidden.

1351
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,590
它是盗窃的一种形式.
It's a form of theft.

1352
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,230
但是，如果上帝不存在，
But if God does not exist,

1353
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,870
陀思妥耶夫斯基（俄国作家）的名言所说:
as Dostoyevskyfamously pointed out,

1354
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:06,110
“如果上帝不存在，人可以任意妄为.”
"lf God does not exist,then everything is permissible."

1355
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,550
虽可妄为，但毫无意义.
And not only permissible,but pointless.

1356
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,110
如果雷森迪教授是正确的，那么所有一切，
If Professor Radisson is right,then all of this,

1357
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:16,470
我们所有的奋斗，我们的辩论，
all of our struggle,our debate,

1358
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,550
无论我们在这里决定了什么，也是毫无意义的.
whatever we decide hereis meaningless.

1359
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,350
我的意思是，我们的生命和我们的死亡，
I mean, our livesand ultimately our deaths

1360
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,750
比金鱼也好不了那里去.
have no more consequencethan that of a goldfish.

1361
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,350
这是荒谬的.
This is ridiculous.

1362
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,990
所以，毕竟你的讨论，
So, after all your talk,

1363
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,110
你所说的这一切无非归结为：
you're saying that it allcomes down to choice:

1364
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,750
选择相信或不相信.
believe or don't believe.

1365
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,550
对的，那些就是我想说的，
That's right,that's all there is.

1366
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,150
那些我想说的也曾发生过，
That's allthere's ever been.

1367
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,990
你我位置之间的唯一区别：
The only difference betweenyour position and my position

1368
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,470
就是你拿走他们的选择.
is that you take awaytheir choice.

1369
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:42,550
你要求他们选择的标题就是:"我不相信”
You demand that they choose thebox marked, "l don't believe."

1370
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,110
是的，因为我想释放他们.
Y es, becauseI want to free them.

1371
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,830
因为宗教就像是一 -
Because religionis like a--

1372
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:50,950
它就像一记父母遗传
it's like a mind virusthat parents have passed on

1373
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,790
给他们孩子的病毒
down to their children,

1374
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,950
而基督教就是那最糟糕的病毒.
and Christianityis the worst virus of all.

1375
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,550
趁我们软弱、生病、无助时，
It slowly creepsinto our lives

1376
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,030
它慢慢地潜入我们的生命.
when we're weakor sick or helpless.

1377
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,670
因此，宗教就是像一种疾病？
So, religionis like a disease?.

1378
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,260
是.是的，它感染了一切.
Yes. Yes, it infectseverything.

1379
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,190
它是理性的敌人.
It's the enemy of reason.

1380
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,830
理性？
Reason?.

1381
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,470
教授，你在很久以前就没理性了.
Professor, you left reasona long time ago.

1382
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,310
你在这儿上的不是哲学课.
What you're teaching hereisn't philosophy.

1383
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,030
它甚至也不是无神论课.
It's not evenatheism anymore.

1384
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,190
你所教的是反神论课.
What you're teachingis antitheism.

1385
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,030
这还不够，你自己不相信.
It's not enoughthat you don't believe.

1386
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,910
你还能让我们一起跟你不相信.
You need all of usto not believe with you.

1387
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,790
你为什么不承认事实？
Why don't youadmit the truth?.

1388
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,380
你只是让他们陷入你的原始迷信中.
You just want to ensnare themin your primitive superstition.

1389
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,590
我要的是让他们做出自己的选择.
What I want is for themto make their own choice.

1390
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,230
这才是上帝想要的（赐自由意志原因）
That's what God wants.

1391
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,430
你不知道我有多享受你将要的失败.
You have no idea how muchI'm gonna enjoy failing you.

1392
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,940
哦，但谁才是你真正希望失败的对像，教授？
Yeah, but who are you reallylooking to fail, Professor?.

1393
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:37,310
我还是神？
Me or God?.

1394
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,110
你恨上帝？
Do you hate God?.

1395
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,750
这甚至都不是一个问题.
That's not evena question.

1396
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,910
好了，你为什么恨上帝？
Okay, why do youhate God?.

1397
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,550
这是荒谬的.
This is ridiculous.

1398
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,190
你为什么恨上帝？请回答这个问题.
Why do you hate God?.Answer the question.

1399
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,870
你已经看到了科学的论据.
You've seen the scienceand the arguments.

1400
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,510
科学都在支持k的存在.
Science supportshis existence.

1401
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,910
你知道事情的真相.
You know the truth.

1402
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,790
那么，你为什么恨k？
So, why do you hate him?.

1403
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,430
为什么？
Why?.!

1404
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,470
这是一个很简单的问题，教授.
It's a very simplequestion, Professor.

1405
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:12,190
你为什么恨上帝？
Why do you hate God?.

1406
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,670
因为k把我身边的一切都夺走了
Because he tookeverything away from me.

1407
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,830
是的，我恨上帝.
Yes, I hate God.

1408
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,870
我对k只有恨.
All I have for himis hate.

1409
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:33,910
你怎么能恨一个人，如果他们不存在？
How can you hate someoneif they don't exist?.

1410
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,550
已经证明不了什么.
You've proven nothing.

1411
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,830
也许不是.
Maybe not.

1412
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,830
他们可以去选择.
They get to choose.

1413
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,230
是上帝已死？
Is God dead?.

1414
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,780
还是上帝未死.
God is not dead.

1415
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,430
上帝未死.
God's not dead.

1416
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,990
上帝未死.上帝未死.
God's not dead.God's not dead.

1417
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,230
上帝未死.上帝未死.上帝未死.
God's not dead.God's not dead.God's not dead.

1418
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,350
上帝未死.上帝未死.上帝未死.
God's not dead.God's not dead.God's not dead.

1419
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:41,990


1420
01:26:45,320 --> 01:27:00,110


1421
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:15,150


1422
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,430


1423
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,270
乔什！
Josh!.

1424
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,030
乔什，乔什！
Josh. Josh!

1425
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,030
你对上帝未死的论证，
Your decision to proveGod is not dead

1426
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,990
极大地影响了我.
has affected me greatly.

1427
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,630
对此，我很高兴.
I'm glad.w

1428
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:39,270
是的，它已经改变了一切.
Yes, and it haschanged everything.

1429
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,470
我已经决定要跟从耶稣.
I've decidedto follow Jesus.

1430
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,510
这很好，马丁.
That's great, Martin.

1431
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,150
嘿，你知道吗？
Hey, you know what?.

1432
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,070
你得看看这个.
You've gottacheck this out.

1433
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,310
- 好.- 来吧.
- Okay.- Come on.

1434
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,590
我为什么要带上我的手提箱呢？
Why did I have tobring my suitcase?.

1435
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,670
没带上，显示你缺少信心.
Not bringing itwould show a lack of faith.

1436
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:07,510
哦，慈爱的天父，求祢让这辆车可以启动吧！
Oh merciful Father,please allow this car to start.

1437
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,950
阿门.
Amen.

1438
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,550
就这样？
That's it?.

1439
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,750
为什么，难道你有一个比
Why, do you have a better"Lord, please make my car run"

1440
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,520
“主啊，求祢让这辆能跑”更好的祝福
blessing that you know?.

1441
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,110
没有
No.

1442
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:25,350
那么，就让我们试一下吧.
So then,let's give it a try.

1443
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,830
好.
Okay.

1444
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,470
不，不，不，不.
No, no, no, no.

1445
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:33,430
先把我们的行李放在后备箱.
Put our bagsin the trunk first.

1446
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:38,760
大卫，我们用我们的整个生活去实践信仰.
David, we spend our entire livestalking about faith.

1447
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,950
现在，我要你显示你的信心.
Now I'm asking youto show faith.

1448
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,390
好.
Okay.

1449
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,630


1450
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:07,310
- 难以置信.- 不，信心.
- Unbelievable.- No. Faith.

1451
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:14,430
- 上帝是良善的.- 一直.
- God is good.- All the time.

1452
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:19,190
- 在一直中？- 上帝是良善的.
- And all the time?.- God is good.

1453
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,710
我甚至都不知道我在这里要干什么？
I don't even knowwhat I'm doing here.

1454
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:41,670
我的意思是，你甚至连我是谁都不知道？
I mean, it's not likeyou even know who I am.

1455
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:57,910
在你的整个人生中，
You prayed and believed

1456
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:01,670
你一直祷告而且相信.
your whole life,

1457
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:07,000
从来没有做错任何事，
never done anything wrong,

1458
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,070
在你却在这里.
and here you are.

1459
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:16,710
你是我所知的那个最好的人，而我是最差的.
You're the nicest person I know,I am the meanest.

1460
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:23,390
你有老年痴呆症，我的生活却是完美的.
You have dementia,my life is perfect.

1461
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:26,910
请向我解释，
Explain that to me.

1462
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,910
有时，魔鬼允许
Sometimes the devilallows people

1463
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:36,070
人们无忧无虑的生活，
to live a lifefree of trouble

1464
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:42,230
是因为它不希望人们转向神.
'cause he doesn't want themturning to God.

1465
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:49,070
你的罪像牢房，除此之外都很美好、舒适，
Your sin is like a jail cell,except it's all nice and comfy,

1466
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:53,230
而且似乎没有任何必要离开.
and there doesn't seem to beany need to leave.

1467
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:58,750
大门是敞开的
The door's wide open

1468
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:04,910
有一天，时候将到
'til one day,time runs out,

1469
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,950
窄门猛一关闭
and the cell doorslams shut

1470
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:17,390
突然...为时已晚.
and suddenly...it's too late.

1471
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,310
你说你是谁？
Who did you say you were?.

1472
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,190
我真不敢相信，
I can't believe this.

1473
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,910
这车真的启动了，
The car actually starts

1474
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,680
现在我们被这帮信徒累得够呛，
and now we're beingdone-in by believers.

1475
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,350
我认为这还是不错的.
I think it's beautiful.q

1476
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,070
你那些智慧的话请不要再说了，
Please,no more words of wisdom.

1477
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:49,710
但我很高兴看到
But I'm just happy to see

1478
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,430
所有这些人去向耶稣唱歌
all these peoplegoing to sing about Jesus.

1479
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,100
快开！
Move!.

1480
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,510
你们好，先生们.
Hello, gentlemen.

1481
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,150
我能帮到你什么吗？
Can I help you?.

1482
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,750
我是艾美.我是“新左派”专栏作者.
I'm Amy Ryan.I write "The New Left."

1483
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,430
你好？
Michael Tait.How are you?.

1484
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,070
我们预约安排过？
Did we schedule this?.

1485
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,790
没有，其实我发现，最好的访问就是脱稿.
No, I actually find that thebest interviews are unscripted.

1486
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,350
因此，在几分钟内，你们就要去那里，
So, in a few minutes, youguys are gonna go out there

1487
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,190
你们将要去唱上帝和耶稣，
and you're gonna singabout God and Jesus

1488
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,590
好像他们就像跟你我如此真实一样
as if they're as realas you and me.

1489
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,510
你们怎么能做到这样？
How can you do that?.

1490
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:31,430
好了，对我们来说，神是为真实的.
Well, to us,they are as real.

1491
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,550
事实上，更是如此.
As a matter of fact,even more so.

1492
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,750
我的意思是，我们存在于此时此地.
I mean, we existin the here and now.

1493
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,310
神是永远存在的.想想这一点.
They've existed forever.Think about that.

1494
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,390
是的，你知道，太初有道，
Y eah, you know,in the beginning was the Word.

1495
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:45,750
道与　神同在，道就是　神.（约1：1）
The Word was with Godand the Word was God.

1496
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,390


1497
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,030
那么，我明白了.当你遭受到抨击时，
So, I see.So when you're pressed,

1498
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,830
你引用了一堆古老且胡写的文章，说
you quote a bunch ofancient scribblings and say,

1499
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,230
“不用担心，这一切都在那里.”
"Don't worry,it's all in there."vfb

1500
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,030
好吧，这些可能是古老的，但并不是胡写的.
Well, they may be ancient,but they're not scribblings.

1501
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:59,350
我的意思是，我们相信上帝给了我们一份说明手册.
I mean, we believe Godgave us an instruction manual,

1502
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,310
告诉我们力量的源泉在那里，
and it's wherewe draw our strength

1503
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,630
还有我们的盼望在那里.
and it's wherewe find our hope.

1504
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,830
那里，请告诉我你的盼望在那里？
So, where do youfind your hope?.

1505
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,680
我正在死去.
I'm dying.

1506
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:29,270
嘿，艾米，你没有在这里恶心我们吧，是吗？
Hey Amy, you're not hereto trash us, are you?.

1507
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,070
我想这些事你曾经都做过吧.
I think that's whatyou might have done,

1508
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:34,390
但是我还是挺纳闷你在这里，
but I think you're herekinda wondering,

1509
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:40,590
有点希望这种东西是真实的,是不?.
kinda hoping that this stuffis for real, aren't you?.

1510
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,550
你怎么知道？
How do you know that?.

1511
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,790
我只是觉得，这就是上帝在说，
I just felt that that'swhat God was saying,

1512
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,020
k只是想让你知道.
and he just wantedyou to know it.

1513
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:54,940
- 我不能
That's I can't

1514
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:58,590
是的，他只是鼓手.
Y eah, and he'sjust the drummer.

1517

1525
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,310
我最亲爱的儿子，
My dearest son,

1526
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:20,270
言语无法表达我对你的爱，
"words cannot expressthe love I have for you

1527
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:21,910
和我心中的悲伤，
"or the sorrow in my heart

1528
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,350
我知道将永远无法看到你成长的过程，
"knowing that I will neverbe able to see you grow up

1529
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,630
并履行上帝在你生命的计划，
"and fulfill God's planfor your life.

1530
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,470
想到离开你那一刻，我的心都要碎了，
"My heart is brokenat the thought of leaving you.

1531

"and his thoughtsare higher than our thoughts.

1534
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:41,750
生活要有力量，靠主常喜乐，
"Live life to the fullest andremain in the joy of the Lord.

1535
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,270
你永远留在我心中.

1536

我爱你.妈妈.

01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,470
好.
Cool.

1549
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:55,990
亲爱的上帝，我们不知道祢在艾米生命中的计划，主啊，
Dear God, we don't knowyour plan for Amy, Lord,

1550
01:36:56,240 --> 01:37:00,150

but we're asking you wouldsave her tonight, Lord.

1551
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:05,350
改变她，洁净她，给她一个全新的开始，主.
Change her, cleanse her,give her a fresh start, Lord.

1552

不要动.

1590
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,790
他的肋骨被撞碎.
His ribs are crushed.

1591
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,910
他的肺部大出血.
His lungsare filling with blood.

1592
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:18,750
他没有多长时间了.
He doesn't have long.

1593
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,390
你确定？
Are you sure?.

1594
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:21,990
是的.
Yeah.

我不能死.
I can't die.

1597
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,990
我还没准备好.
I'm not ready.

1598

你知道耶稣吗？
Do you know Jesus?.

1599
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,630
我是一个无神论者.
I'm an atheist.

1600
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,870
我相信这是上帝的怜悯是把我带到这里，现在.
I believe it's God's mercythat brought me here right now.

1601
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,350
我要死了.
I'm dying.

1602
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:43,990
你怎么能称之为怜悯？
How can youcall that mercy?.

1603
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,550
因为这车可以可能立刻撞死你.
Because that car could havekilled you instantly.

1604
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:49,390
我敢肯定，你现在真巴不得是那样.

01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:39,430
?The walls that keep you from being you?

1737
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:41,990
?And walk, walk towards the light?

1738
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:45,820
?And don't stop'til you live your life?

1739
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,550
?Like someone died for you?

1740
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:53,430
?This is the time to try?

1741
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:59,070
?Just step out,your life is waiting?

1742
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:06,270
?And as you fall,you'll find that you can fly?

1743
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,910
?Ask anyone whose time is up?

1744
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:20,990
?What they'd give for what you've got?

1745
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:24,740
?And how they'd live your life?

1746
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,710
?Live like your life's worth dying for?

1747
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:30,430
?You just walked out that prison door?

1748
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:33,590
?And you'll know how to live your life?

1749
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:38,510
?This is the time to try?

1750
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:44,190
?Just step out,your life is waiting?

1751
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:51,390
?And as you fall,you'll find that you can fly?

1752
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:58,470
?This is the time to try?

1753
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:03,950
?Just step out,your life is waiting?

1754
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:11,190
?And as you fall,you'll find that you can fly?

1755
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:18,470
?This is the time to try?

1756
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:23,950
?Just step out,your life is waiting?

1757
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:31,150
