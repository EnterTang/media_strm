Yeah. He's right.

PROFESSOR FOSDICK: In 1836,

134
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:02,542
the founders of Union were

00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:18,183
I'm certain that
the German theologians

00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,768
that sent their
star pupil from Berlin

143
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,522
would not want him

DIETRICH: Inflicting that
level of boredom

148
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,993
should absolutely get
a man fired.

149
00:14:37,118 --> 00:14:39,412
FISHER: If bad lectures
got a man fired at Union,

150
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:41,998

empty a long time ago.

Alas, there was no cure

DIETRICH: When we were little,

497
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:55,413
I used to steal
father's cigarettes

498

smoke them up here.

MÜLLER: Finally, my friends,
we know who we are.

00:40:11,402 --> 00:40:17,490
How long have we waited
for this moment

543
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:23,372
when we can finally hear
Germany's heart beat again?

544
00:40:33,673 --> 00:40:37,552
At last we have
read the writing

545
00:40:37,678 --> 00:40:41,682
on the walls
of this country's soul,

546
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,060

Chancellor Adolf Hitler!

548
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:55,820
God sent Germany a prophet.

549
00:40:56,863 --> 00:40:59,575
And more than that.

550
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:01,702
A true Savior!

551
00:41:03,287 --> 00:41:05,663
- To speak of any Savior
but Christ from the pulpit...

552
00:41:05,788 --> 00:41:07,082
blasphemy.

553
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:11,753
-Dietrich, everything new
needs a moment to settle.

554

-We're in God's house

555
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:16,633
and the bishop
is celebrating a man.

556
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:18,468
I don't need time
to “let it settle.”

557
00:41:18,593 --> 00:41:21,055
MÜLLER: So that we can solve
the great challenges

558
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,890
facing our people.

559
00:41:23,265 --> 00:41:25,767
To combine our shared power

560
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:29,228
so that we can
achieve this together.

561

-Alright.

00:41:31,398 --> 00:41:33,108
Alright, you don't
support Hitler.

Many don't.

But that doesn't mean that
you can make a distraction...

Dietrich.

You've been away quite a while,

569

has been building--

570
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,625
-building what?

I don't even know what.

This man is without charm,
without character or charisma.

574
00:41:57,382 --> 00:42:00,468
-He has captured the
nation's imagination, Dietrich.

575
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,263
And our churches are fuller
than have been in years.

Bishop, it's about who.

Don't you realize handing a man
this kind of crown

578

will come with
a terrible price?

targeting, the Jews.

-Yeah. Surely Herr Hitler
will resolve

the Jewish question too.

a Jewish question?

it has long been our policy

should not intersect.

to Chancellor Hitler?

We both fought
in the Great War.

594
00:42:57,902 --> 00:42:58,735
He might listen.

595
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,903
-Then tell him the church
does not belong to him

596
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:01,905
or any man.

597
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,907
It belongs to the living God.

00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:07,285
-Not everything needs
to be a fight, Dietrich.

Your heart is moving faster
than your mind.

-Yes, speed matters.

601

If no one warns
the German people,

602
00:43:14,627 --> 00:43:16,253
they might think
the entire clergy

603
00:43:16,378 --> 00:43:18,755
agrees with Bishop Müller
and his sycophants.

604
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:21,967
I have the pulpit at
Kaiser Wilhelm in two weeks.

At Jacobi's invitation.

606
00:43:23,302 --> 00:43:24,595
In fact, that might be
the perfect opportunity

607
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,678
to speak up against...

still remains your superior.

I advise you recall

612
00:43:34,228 --> 00:43:36,565
the words of the English writer
William Shakespeare.

“Discretion is the
better part of valor.”

of a Jewish writer, Paul.

'God has not given us
a spirit of fear.'

-If you don't take
your fear from God,

for the “religious”.

651
00:47:44,353 --> 00:47:47,232
Because there has never been
anyone in history

652
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:52,445
who hated religion
more than Jesus Christ.

653
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,492
He never wanted our religion.

654
00:47:58,535 --> 00:48:00,578
All he ever wanted...

655
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:03,665
was us.

656
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:09,712
Our full selves.

657
00:48:12,132 --> 00:48:16,093
But we, the German church,

658
00:48:17,387 --> 00:48:22,017
are on the verge of
giving ourselves to another.

659
00:48:23,393 --> 00:48:28,648
Of choosing full pews
over full hearts.

660
00:48:30,025 --> 00:48:34,612
The church should be
a place of refuge,

661
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:36,782
a place of sanctuary,

662
00:48:37,323 --> 00:48:39,283
not a place of power.

663
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:46,500
The German church
must stand on God's word alone.

664
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:49,543
Not any man's word,

665
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:55,425
and especially
not a Führer's word.

666

DIETRICH: Turn with
me in scripture

668
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,610
to Matthew chapter five.

669
00:49:20,408 --> 00:49:22,910
-It's been a long time
since I've heard truth

670
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:24,495
preached from their pulpit.

671
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:25,830
Thank you.

672
00:49:26,455 --> 00:49:28,250
-I wish you were preaching
every Sunday.

673
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:30,335
Might actually get my Otto
back to church.

674
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,420
-What a privilege
to be with you all.

675
00:49:33,505 --> 00:49:36,592
-Oh, yes, it was a privilege.
One squandered.

676
00:49:36,717 --> 00:49:38,802
But now you have
people's attention, Dietrich.

677
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,597
Perhaps that's everything
you've ever wanted.

678
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:45,558
-I'm sorry if...

679
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:48,060
-The truth doesn't
apologize for being true.

680
00:49:50,147 --> 00:49:52,440
The truth also separates
marrow from bone.

681
00:49:53,107 --> 00:49:55,610
You are on the other side
of those words now, Dietrich.

682
00:49:56,987 --> 00:49:57,737
Beware,

683
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:00,282
you're not standing on the same
ground you were yesterday.

684
00:50:04,743 --> 00:50:06,120
-I'm so proud.

685
00:50:06,955 --> 00:50:07,997
...just brilliant, brother.

686
00:50:08,122 --> 00:50:09,665
-Thank you.
-Brilliant.

687
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,127
-Mother. Father.

688
00:50:13,587 --> 00:50:15,005
-Courage needed, Son.

689
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:18,258
Courage shown.

690
00:50:19,342 --> 00:50:20,927
-You were wonderful, son.

691
00:50:21,177 --> 00:50:23,472
But it looked like you were
painting a target on your chest

692
00:50:23,597 --> 00:50:25,182
with every single sentence.

693
00:50:26,015 --> 00:50:27,892
-Better a target
than a swastika.

694
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:30,103
-Why does there
have to be a target?

695
00:50:30,478 --> 00:50:32,397
There were not so many
in the church today.

696
00:50:32,522 --> 00:50:33,690
-A message like that,

697
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:36,735
it's not the size of the crowd

698
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:39,695
but who's been
paying attention.

demand the immediate cessation

702
00:50:55,628 --> 00:50:57,672
of the publishing
and dissemination

703

German Bible will be Aryan,

with no Jewish roots.
No Jewish weakness.

707
00:51:20,237 --> 00:51:24,532
The church must clear away
all crucifixes, Bibles

708
00:51:26,492 --> 00:51:27,993
and images of the saints,

709
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,913
and replace them

710
00:51:31,372 --> 00:51:34,625
with our leader's
glorious words.

711
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:40,215
And it must be superseded by
the only unconquerable symbol,

712
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,800
the swastika!

you don't think I know it's you

This is not a joke

Hey, I don't need

Because do something we must.

since I gave you that Sunday
at Kaiser Wilhelm.

for the truth already.

not only angered the Nazis,

755
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:03,232
it also galvanized a whole raft
of seminary students

756

and made you
friends in places

even go to church.

the church's life
is on the line.

760

-I'm about to ask you
to save the German church.

-To save it,

we'll have to split it apart.

is the church

For those who have no voice.

of which there is no proof.

793

How do we know that this is
simply not Jewish propaganda?

796

Hitler has carved them
out of society.

797
00:56:01,475 --> 00:56:05,855
Left them stateless,
unprotected.

798
00:56:06,688 --> 00:56:10,985
So look me in the eye
and call me propaganda.

799
00:56:13,362 --> 00:56:16,323
I have secreted myself
here to tell you

800
00:56:17,283 --> 00:56:20,202
that the true German church
has no alternative

801
00:56:20,328 --> 00:56:23,080
but to break away from
the false church of the Nazis,

802
00:56:23,205 --> 00:56:25,123
their Reichskirche.

803
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:28,335
We need to let the world know
what the Nazis are

doing to the Jews.

805
00:56:30,922 --> 00:56:34,883
And if the church
does not speak now,

806
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,680
we will lose our voice
for a hundred years.

because I was not a socialist.

And when they later came
for the trade unionists,

I didn't speak out

And then they
came for the Jews,

created the Gestapo

The Abwehr works
independently of the Führer.

The Nazis plan to imprison
or front-line every pastor

the knee to Hitler.

to understand

1147
01:22:23,765 --> 01:22:25,350
that your life will
not be the same

1148

instead of action.

how to keep your hands clean.”

to assassinate the Führer.

that empty promise?

1168

DIETRICH: I did.

1169
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:39,632
And I was right.

1170
01:23:40,842 --> 01:23:42,010
Before Hitler.

1171
01:23:42,135 --> 01:23:44,512
Is Hitler the first evil ruler
since scripture was written?

1172
01:23:44,637 --> 01:23:45,638
DIETRICH: No.

1173
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,642
But he's the first one
I can stop.

1174

What do you require of me?

1175
01:23:56,357 --> 01:23:58,483
EBERHARD: Will God forgive us
if we do this?

1176
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:00,903
-Will He forgive us
if we don't?

-In order to
destroy the Führer,

you must
first swear allegiance...

Otherwise, you sit home
in forced silence,

-And what is that,
Herr Bonhoeffer?

02:01:15,302 --> 02:01:17,303
for they shall receive mercy.

1609
02:01:19,765 --> 02:01:21,225
Blessed...

1610
02:01:22,433 --> 02:01:24,270
are the pure in heart,

1611
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:28,023
For they shall see...

1612
02:01:30,275 --> 02:01:31,818
God.”

1613
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:47,960
