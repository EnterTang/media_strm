1
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:06,207
Fucking asshole. Fucking asshole.

2
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:08,815
Fucking asshole.

3
00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:23,518
I'll have...

4
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:29,297
a clericot.

5
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:31,257
I don't know, Fer,

6
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:34,198
it's just that I think
I've got the right to see you.

7
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:35,859
What right?

8
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:41,602
And don't call me Fer, Chano.
Are you brain-dead or what?

9
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:49,114
The only right you have
is to shut your stupid gob.

10
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:56,845
So what? You think because
we had a scene once,

11
00:02:56,923 --> 00:03:01,656
you can cruise in when you fuckin'
feel like it and I'm gonna fall all over you?

12
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:05,830
Chano, you ripped off my father, you moron.

13
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:09,769
You robbed my father.

14
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:20,405
And what you did to me,
you half-witted shithead.

15
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:25,645
You're a turd, garbage!

16
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:28,085
A slimy worm who thrives on his own crap.

17
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:31,920
No. You're not even garbage.
You're nothing, you're invisible! Nothing at all.

18
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:41,565
You make me so fucking angry, you jerk.

19
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:50,838
You're so full of shit,
you make me want to puke.

20
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:04,349
See that? I even pay my bills now.
Tips and all.

21
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,428
You are so pathetic.
You think you're funny, it's all a big joke?

22
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:17,462
- Martín, can you put it on my tab?
- Sure, no problem.

23
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:20,472
- See you.
- Take care.

24
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:54,399
Seriously, Chano. Isn't it painful
not having self-respect or shame?

25
00:04:55,542 --> 00:05:00,275
I don't know. I guess I'd like to be
different or something,

26
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:02,815
but I sure ain't suffering over it.

27
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:08,152
What's worst is that
you think you're being so cool,

28
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:10,485
but what you don't realize

29
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:15,017
is that everyone thinks
you're a half-wit, trapped in the past.

30
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:17,256
Well, maybe they're...

31
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,788
You see? You don't give a damn.
Makes me sick.

32
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:26,632
Haven't you noticed we've all grown up?
You still act like a stupid kid,

33
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:30,938
thinking it's cool
to be the class clown.

34
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:35,972
I mean, just look at what you're wearing.
You've got to be kidding.

35
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:43,420
They're from my work,
and nobody thinks I'm the class clown.

36
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,185
That's what you think.

37
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,057
You wouldn't believe how many people
congratulated me when you left.

38
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:51,924
Nobody loves you!

39
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:56,958
You think I care if those prissy
little faggots like me or not?

40
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:01,835
So, tell me? You found yourself
a little Romeo yet?

41
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:07,007
Really?

42
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,980
- Yes, Chano.
- Who?

43
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:14,787
Who?

44
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:18,551
- You don't know him.
- Who is he? He must have a name.

45
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:22,327
His name is Gonzalo.

46
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,829
Gonzalo?

47
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:28,390
No way! I know him! Are you for real?

48
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:31,801
Gonzalo? How low can you go?

49
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:33,805
I can't believe it. For real?

50
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:40,710
So, does he make you happy?

51
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:43,678
More than I've ever been.

52
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:49,080
How weird. You always
wanted to live with a yuppie.

53
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:51,589
He's not a yuppie,
and you can cut the crap!

54
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:54,058
I have much more fun with him
than I ever did with you.

55
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:59,155
Uh-huh, Fernanda, yeah.
Sure thing, Fer!

56
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:02,201
Seriously, Chano, do something
with your life. You're pitiful.

57
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:04,293
<i>Au revoir.</i>

58
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,601
- Cut the international crap, Fer, okay?
- Go away, loser.

59
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,387
Hello? Lore?
Guess who I was with just right now.

60
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:30,259
Chano, Lore. I swear it...
Wait, let me see...

61
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:41,504
Get lost. What do you want?
I'm not letting you in.

62
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:49,372
Yeah, I answered the door,
and Chano was standing there

63
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:52,350
with his moronic half-wit face.

64
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:59,251
I don't know. He's a loser.

65
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:06,029
It was incredible, but...
No, no, no, I already had a go at him.

66
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,300
The truth is, I realized I never loved him.

67
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:16,703
I'll call you back.

68
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:24,611
What now Chano? What?

69
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:26,083
What you mean, what?

70
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:32,220
Chano, what's wrong with you?

71
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:35,591
- Let go of me!
- Keep still!

72
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:37,528
What?

73
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,059
Chano, stop!

74
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,700
What are you doing?

75
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:50,137
Chano, stop!

76
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:09,952
- Shut up, bitch.
- Chano, stop!

77
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:11,792
- Shut up, Fer.
- Not like this.

78
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,803
I want you.

79
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,274
- Use a condom.
- Come off it, bitch. I'm raping you.

80
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,386
- Take my shirt off.
- Yes.

81
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:15,288
Hold on.

82
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:16,692
- I can't.
- Hold on.

83
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:20,522
Chano!

84
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:24,398
Damn you, Chano!

85
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:33,340
What a fool.

86
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:53,532
Give me a cigarette.

87
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:03,872
No, no, no, no!
What's with...

88
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,380
Now what?

89
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:22,051
Jesus, Chano,
you tore all my clothes.

90
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:43,014
So, where were you?

91
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:44,071
Around.

92
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:47,548
I got a job on a cruise ship.

93
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,212
You?

94
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:51,779
Yeah, I was the piano player.

95
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:52,882
I don't believe you.

96
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,053
No bullshit. I had to dance
with the grannies, too.

97
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:03,865
- Were you a gigolo? Truth?
- I was the piano player.

98
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:08,865
- And a boy toy for the grannies.
- That, too.

99
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:21,884
Hello, little rat.

100
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,082
Did you miss me?

101
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,561
How much?

102
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:56,047
Why didn't you take me with you?

103
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,830
It's the least you could have done,
after stealing my father's money.

104
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:27,347
What are you doing?

105
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:36,593
What are you up to?

106
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:44,168
Talk about stupid.

107
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,431
I'm such an idiot.

108
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:54,845
I waited months
for you to come back for me.

109
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:11,962
Chano, Chano, what are you doing?

110
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:19,494
Chano, come here.

111
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:40,154
So, what's your father doing now?

112
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:44,785
Same as always. Living off his hotels.

113
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:56,636
Fernanda!

114
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,040
Fernanda!

115
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:02,912
- Fer?
- What?

116
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:06,285
How come the house is such a mess?

117
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:10,448
After my parents' big fight,
my father moved into his office.

118
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:13,290
That's why the house is falling apart.

119
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:16,795
It's a fucking mess,
nobody lifts a finger here anymore.

120
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:20,593
They're still looking for you, you know.

121
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,362
If he sees you, you'll end up
in the can for sure.

122
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:26,703
So where do you live?

123
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:29,138
Where you left me, you asshole.

124
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,911
Fer, I'm asking you.
Are you living here with your little boyfriend?

125
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:39,277
All right, you bastard,
you've fucking had it, now.

126
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:40,683
Fer, what are you doing?

127
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:48,691
I missed you so much, you little rat.

128
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,131
Give me the payroll.

129
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:16,109
But it's not deposited
until tomorrow, sir.

130
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:19,913
Exactly, give it to me. I'll deposit it.

131
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:22,419
But the deposit isn't due till tomorrow, sir.

132
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:26,217
Precisely my point.

133
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,919
Very well.

134
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:32,220
But I will need you to sign for it, sir.

135
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:39,498
That way I'm covered.

136
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:50,010
Come in.

137
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,713
What is it, Jaime?

138
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,794
Yes, but of course.

139
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:19,698
Well, I don't think it was
anything to get angry about.

140
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,733
No, there's no problem.
Well, for me at least.

141
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:29,043
Yes, yes.

142
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:38,915
I thought you weren't
coming home for dinner.

143
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:40,982
So what's all this, then?

144
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:44,358
I'm talking to you.

145
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:47,622
Drinking?

146
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:53,700
I'm talking to you.

147
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,076
What's the matter?

148
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,441
What do you think of your father?
He's drinking.

149
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:11,081
Do you want something to eat, son?

150
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:14,057
I already told you, Mom.
I don't eat meat anymore.

151
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:19,595
Dad, will you give me the money
to buy some boots?

152
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:23,659
Where's your sister?

153
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:27,663
I don't know, in her bedroom, depressed.

154
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,924
Hey, Dad, I really need those boots!

155
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,277
Take me.

156
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:58,886
<i>The national team won their game.</i>

157
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:03,417
<i>Look, "I'd love to meet you".</i>
<i>That phrase is used by a lot of people.</i>

158
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:09,434
<i>"I'd love to meet you".</i>
<i>And, well, since the first time they see you,</i>

159
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:14,598
<i>they start talking about superficial</i>
<i>subjects, please don't take offense...</i>

160
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:17,073
<i>it's also rather ridiculous,</i>
<i>but what can you do?</i>

161
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:19,736
<i>No way you're gonna start</i>
<i>telling them about being</i>

162
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,370
<i>Aristotle's cousin, true?</i>

163
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:29,610
Yeah.

164
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:31,485
That's terrible.

165
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:38,253
Your mom.

166
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,561
No, no, don't worry... yes...

167
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:47,035
Yes, if I hear anything, I'll let you know.
Really, I promise.

168
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:50,075
But calm down, will you, sis?

169
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:51,769
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

170
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:56,407
But relax, huh? Bye.

171
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:01,611
Mariana, your mother is hysterical.

172
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:03,279
If she finds out you're here...

173
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,823
Yeah, I know,
but I'm totally fed up with her.

174
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:08,793
But don't you think
you should at least call her?

175
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:11,853
- I can't cope with her any longer.
- So what, then?

176
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:16,123
You can't stay here forever.

177
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:21,104
- I'll straighten it all out tomorrow.
- Come on, Mom, let me sleep!

178
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:24,473
So...

179
00:24:24,543 --> 00:24:27,603
- What's the plan, then?
- Let's go some place.

180
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:31,947
The boss is away so I can
take you to have some really good

181
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:34,281
<i>Piñas Coladas,</i> what do you say?

182
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,117
Hi.

183
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:24,494
We have to get you an ID
so you can get into the bars.

184
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,869
- Yeah, otherwise, no way.
- And fix your hair.

185
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:32,243
And steer clear of the Mexicans.
They're the worst.

186
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:35,303
And you can forget about the Chilangos.
They always rob you.

187
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,113
Once you spot a possibility,
move in and make a sexy mouth.

188
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:42,176
What's a sexy mouth?

189
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:43,448
Caleto!

190
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:48,118
Jenny, what gives, Jenny?
How you doin'?

191
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:50,093
- Good.
- That's so good.

192
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:53,563
We haven't met. Ah, Yahaira?

193
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:56,328
Marta, how're things, my little chickies?

194
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:58,528
- Now then, who are you?
- She's my friend, Tigrillo.

195
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:03,166
- She's gonna become a Yahaira.
- Oh, a Yahaira, eh?

196
00:26:03,242 --> 00:26:05,608
Except I don't understand about
how to make a sexy mouth.

197
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:08,441
- It's like what Paulina Rubio does.
- How?

198
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,037
- Ooh baby...
- Haven't you seen her?

199
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:13,676
Look, it's like this.
As if you'd just bitten a chili.

200
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:16,721
- Like this?
- No, like this.

201
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:17,846
Like this.

202
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:19,948
Oh, honeychild,
it's the first thing you gotta learn.

203
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:22,789
- Like this?
- Like this.

204
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:25,694
Oh, yeah, real sexy,
like Madonna, oh, yeah.

205
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:28,289
- Like this?
- How?

206
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:30,528
Oh, girlie, you must know.
Where are you from?

207
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:31,694
You got it!

208
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,534
So, when you find yourself
some rich-looking dudes,

209
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:36,904
you move in on them and ask them
if they want a massage.

210
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:41,503
If they don't speak Spanish, you say
"Want massage and oral relaxation?"

211
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,517
They all say yes, but just
don't ever go into their rooms.

212
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:51,113
- How do you say it?
- "Re-lax-ation."

213
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:52,918
But don't let them touch you,

214
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:55,585
or get you into their room,
or your done for.

215
00:26:57,195 --> 00:27:01,655
Look, those fat guys
are the "Never fails."

216
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:02,893
The what?

217
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:08,031
Look, we're the "You hire us" and
those over there are the "Never fails".

218
00:27:08,106 --> 00:27:10,165
They're old and they've got fat asses.
That's why they hate us.

219
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:12,142
They're so pissed
they even hit us the other day

220
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,643
'cause we took off with
some real smooth dudes.

221
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:16,203
And if they see you with us,
they'll want to hit you.

222
00:27:16,281 --> 00:27:18,772
Yeah, so be real careful,
'cause they hit hard.

223
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:42,863
Well, seems like these guys are sucked in,
but there's only three, so we'll catch you later.

224
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:45,171
- Find yourself one, sis.
- But I...

225
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:49,077
- Don't let them take your clothes off.
- I want to go with you.

226
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:18,799
Hello.

227
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:22,943
Hello.

228
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,391
Buddy! Buddy!

229
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:22,825
- Buddy, buddy, do you want a room?
- Yes, for a night.

230
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:33,376
- Can I get your luggage?
- No, thank you, I don't have any.

231
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:38,212
The keys are in the door.
If you need anything, just ask for it.

232
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:40,114
Fine.

233
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:09,592
Fucking brilliant.

234
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:50,366
- How much is it?
- 28 pesos.

235
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,612
Don't you have any change?

236
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:58,040
Nope.

237
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:16,566
<i>Oh, you're American?</i>
<i>Let me see yours.</i>

238
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:22,701
<i>It will grow, I promise.</i>

239
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:33,015
- What are you doing here?
- What?

240
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:35,143
What do you mean what?
What are you doing here?

241
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,120
Just hanging, can't you see?

242
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:42,216
Get lost.

243
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:43,885
Nope.

244
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:47,926
We were here first, so move it, jerk.

245
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:54,267
Well, I'm not moving. So how about that?

246
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:56,603
If you don't move,
I'll beat the crap out of you.

247
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:59,573
What?

248
00:34:59,644 --> 00:35:03,239
- I will beat the crap out of you.
- What?

249
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:07,375
That I will beat the crap out of you.
So I'm asking you nicely, beat it.

250
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:11,081
- Cool.
- No "cool." I mean it, you creep, piss off.

251
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:12,817
- You piss off.
- You!

252
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:14,119
You.

253
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:18,688
You.

254
00:35:20,198 --> 00:35:21,256
Cool.

255
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:30,741
Fat sluts!

256
00:35:58,837 --> 00:35:59,929
Hello.

257
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,913
How you doing, mister?

258
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:14,547
Fine, just fine.

259
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:19,556
Hey.

260
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:22,650
- Are you tired?
- What?

261
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:27,357
- I asked if you're tired.
- Yes, a bit.

262
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:32,131
Do you want a massage
with relaxation?

263
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:37,231
No, not right now.

264
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:41,744
- Come on.
- I said no.

265
00:36:43,348 --> 00:36:45,816
Come on.

266
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:49,376
- No.
- Then buy me a drink.

267
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:53,782
- What?
- Then buy me a drink.

268
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:55,587
I said no.

269
00:36:56,861 --> 00:36:59,421
Miserable old tightwad.

270
00:36:59,497 --> 00:37:02,091
Yes, so?

271
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,069
No good.

272
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:13,167
You probably don't have
any money, anyway.

273
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:15,542
Real cool, mister.

274
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:18,047
Have a blast of a time
here in boredom-land, mister.

275
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:22,250
Cool vibe, man.

276
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:12,330
What's your trip, you old fart?
Go laugh at your mother, asshole.

277
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:27,308
What?

278
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:46,826
I'm hungry.

279
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:50,163
So are we gonna take off or what?

280
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:52,768
I don't know.

281
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,773
- Do you love me?
- No.

282
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:08,147
No?

283
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:10,983
- Then neither do I.
- That's cool.

284
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:15,449
Come on, Chano, seriously.

285
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:18,086
What?

286
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:21,325
- Do you love me?
- I said yes.

287
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:26,600
Chano, you make me want to puke.

288
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,729
I make you want to puke?

289
00:40:31,843 --> 00:40:34,869
- Yeah.
- Why?

290
00:40:34,946 --> 00:40:37,005
Because you're a coward.

291
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:52,396
I'm not a coward, okay?

292
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:55,395
Prove it.

293
00:40:58,302 --> 00:41:02,170
- You're so silly!
- You asked for it, Fernanda.

294
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,935
I mean it, Chano, prove it!

295
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:07,335
Okay, okay, okay.

296
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,314
We'll get some money together
and split from here.

297
00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:13,373
- Just like that?
- Uh-huh.

298
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:16,215
I don't know.
I can't just leave like that.

299
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:18,187
Why not? It's your decision.

300
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,988
Gonzalo would totally lose it,

301
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:27,326
and I really do care about him.

302
00:41:27,398 --> 00:41:28,956
It's your call.

303
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,766
- Okay. Did you like it?
- Mm-hmm.

304
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:43,677
- Where do you want to go?
- Any place you want.

305
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:46,239
Mexico City or Yankeeland, if you want.

306
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:49,844
- Yeah, right. How?
- That's the cool part.

307
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:50,979
Why?

308
00:41:51,055 --> 00:41:53,615
Because we're gonna
ask your father for the money.

309
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:57,127
Chano, you're a nut case.

310
00:41:57,195 --> 00:42:00,096
If my father sees you, you're dead meat.

311
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:03,793
You robbed him.
He'll make sure they lock you away.

312
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:07,065
Social justice, babe.
What's the problem?

313
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:10,869
You really are one crazy,
sick dude, Chano.

314
00:42:13,211 --> 00:42:16,772
- You're stark raving mad!
- You're a little coward.

315
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:18,315
A little coward.

316
00:42:20,985 --> 00:42:24,887
A little coward. Then stay in Crapapulco.
I'm out of here.

317
00:42:27,124 --> 00:42:31,584
If you ever leave me again,
I'll kill you. Okay?

318
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:40,467
This is just fantastic.

319
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:47,435
- You outdid yourself, mister.
- You see?

320
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:49,970
So, what should I call you?

321
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:54,151
Me? Eh, Jennifer.

322
00:42:54,218 --> 00:42:55,378
But they call me Tigrillo.

323
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:00,550
Where did you come from, Tigrillo?

324
00:43:03,227 --> 00:43:07,721
We're from D.F.,
but the story is a bit more complicated

325
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:11,598
because my mother
was a very famous singer.

326
00:43:12,837 --> 00:43:15,931
But she died in a plane crash.

327
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:21,110
So I guess I'm kind of
half an orphan, or something,

328
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,074
because, well, I'm actually
looking for my father.

329
00:43:25,149 --> 00:43:26,844
He's Italian.

330
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:29,785
I've never actually met him, you see.

331
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:32,049
So what do you think?

332
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:34,489
Are you gonna ask me more questions?
Or is that it?

333
00:43:34,558 --> 00:43:36,355
No, no more.

334
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:39,822
Are you ready to order?

335
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:42,695
Yes, I'll have...

336
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,563
a jug of clericot
and the shrimps au naturel.

337
00:43:51,943 --> 00:43:54,070
- And for you, sir?
- The same for me.

338
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:57,638
- Will that be all?
- Yes.

339
00:43:57,715 --> 00:43:59,444
What do you think we are to each other?

340
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:02,852
I don't know.

341
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,822
What are we to each other?
Father and daughter? Or lovers?

342
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:15,163
I don't know, Jennifer. We'll work it out
as we see how things go, okay?

343
00:44:15,232 --> 00:44:16,631
Cool.

344
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:21,167
This is really great, mister. I was starving.

345
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,740
You want one?

346
00:44:34,852 --> 00:44:37,480
See those two?

347
00:44:37,555 --> 00:44:40,285
Yes, what about them?

348
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:42,053
That girl...

349
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,991
has another boyfriend,

350
00:44:47,064 --> 00:44:49,123
and I think she's cheating on him.

351
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,724
That's dreadful.

352
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:52,564
I'll say.

353
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:54,661
But maybe it's not,
because her boyfriend is an asshole.

354
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:58,607
Even so, it's not right.
Don't you be like her when you grow up.

355
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:01,873
No way. I'm not into all that boyfriend stuff.

356
00:45:01,946 --> 00:45:03,811
It turns ugly in like two seconds.

357
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:07,540
You'll see, later you'll be chasing them.

358
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:10,917
Not me. Never.

359
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:14,719
Nothing but suffering.

360
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:17,488
Besides I already have you, don't I?

361
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:22,932
I don't know, Jenny.
I don't think I'll be around for very long.

362
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:27,064
Come on, call me Tigrillo.

363
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:28,833
Tigrillo.

364
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,511
Easy does it.

365
00:45:43,654 --> 00:45:48,682
It's her, dude! So, Fernanda
turned out to be a whore.

366
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:50,886
The shit's about to hit the fan, bro.

367
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:52,428
What a slut!

368
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:56,358
Okay, you assholes,
Kabul is going into act!

369
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:58,334
What? Are really gonna tell Gonzo?

370
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:00,267
It's gonna be heavy.
He's really hung up on her.

371
00:46:00,337 --> 00:46:02,202
No way, fucker, rules are rules.

372
00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:05,765
If my bitch was playing me
and you bastards kept it from me, and...

373
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:06,867
I'd kill you assholes.

374
00:46:06,944 --> 00:46:08,775
- I'd kill you.
- Blood oath.

375
00:46:08,846 --> 00:46:11,212
- Heart of Stone, you bastards!
- Blood oath!

376
00:46:11,282 --> 00:46:13,807
- Heart of Stone!
- Heart of Stone!

377
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:19,222
Kabul! Kabul! Kabul!

378
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,951
"PLEASE DON'T PEE
IN THE REFEREE'S BOX"

379
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:24,552
Everyone, stay alert, concentrate!

380
00:46:24,628 --> 00:46:28,189
Don't leave it up there, keep moving!

381
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:31,958
- Motherfucker!
- Come on, asshole!

382
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:34,834
You can't beat me, fucker.

383
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:37,468
Move up!

384
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:39,902
Move your ass, man!

385
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:44,038
No way. Hey sir, it wasn't, sir!

386
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,475
Changa! Hey, everyone.

387
00:46:48,552 --> 00:46:52,147
Come down! Juan, I said everyone!

388
00:46:52,223 --> 00:46:54,191
To the left, Changa! Right there!

389
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:56,886
Come on, run faster,
take it out from there!

390
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,997
You can't beat me, prick!
You can't beat me, fucker!

391
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:06,059
Why bother shooting
if you ain't gonna score?

392
00:47:09,974 --> 00:47:11,032
What's the problem?

393
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:14,441
Language, sir.
Swearing is not permitted.

394
00:47:15,346 --> 00:47:17,211
But what did I say?

395
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:20,243
Move up, man!

396
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:39,936
Turn that music off, Ballena, you prick.
I can't concentrate.

397
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:42,298
Shut up and play, fag.

398
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:44,967
- Go ahead, champ.
- No. Put that away.

399
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:49,442
I mean it, asshole, turn it off.
I can't concentrate.

400
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:50,844
Can it, dude, we got trouble.

401
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:52,974
- What?
- Some real crazy shit.

402
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,314
Come on, asshole, tell me.
What did you see?

403
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:58,355
Well, we saw Fer.

404
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,348
What?

405
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:04,622
She had her tongue halfway down
some asshole's throat.

406
00:48:04,695 --> 00:48:06,492
Cut the crap, jerkoff,
and tell me what you saw.

407
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:08,964
Blood oath, man, we saw her, didn't we?

408
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:18,633
Are you positive?

409
00:48:24,114 --> 00:48:25,945
Are you all positive?

410
00:48:47,538 --> 00:48:50,336
And what else, dude?
So who was this fucker?

411
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:52,170
It was Chano, her ex.

412
00:48:58,349 --> 00:49:00,613
Look at that, sir. I demand respect.

413
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:03,619
- Shut up, fucker!
- And play, faggot!

414
00:49:07,658 --> 00:49:09,956
Hey, Gonzo, that's not allowed here!

415
00:50:55,299 --> 00:50:57,426
Let's go, eh?

416
00:50:57,501 --> 00:51:01,870
- I'm seeing double.
- That's the point, isn't it?

417
00:51:04,942 --> 00:51:06,466
Time to pay the boss.

418
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:19,212
- Shit.
- What?

419
00:51:22,092 --> 00:51:23,889
I can't find my wallet.

420
00:51:26,363 --> 00:51:27,955
I swear.

421
00:51:28,031 --> 00:51:30,829
Jesus, what a drag, dude.

422
00:51:30,901 --> 00:51:33,028
How good a runner are you?

423
00:51:33,103 --> 00:51:35,196
Why?

424
00:51:35,272 --> 00:51:39,231
Well, if there isn't a wallet,
we'll have to make a run for it, won't we?

425
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:42,838
Well, I don't know. How?

426
00:51:42,913 --> 00:51:45,541
Yes, we stand up and walk out.

427
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:50,151
So what, do we start
running at the same time?

428
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,451
Yeah, you go first and I'll follow you.

429
00:51:57,127 --> 00:51:59,561
Go on. Step on it.

430
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:09,031
You're a bit of a loser, eh?

431
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:14,235
Don't ask. I saved your ass.

432
00:52:14,945 --> 00:52:16,674
When did you do it?

433
00:52:16,747 --> 00:52:20,513
No Questions to make me feel ashamed.

434
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:24,416
- Come on, man, let's go.
- So, what was she saying?

435
00:52:24,488 --> 00:52:28,481
What could she say?
She didn't see us.

436
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,460
She was sticking her tongue
into this other jerkoff.

437
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:33,428
Come on, let's go. We said
we were going to the warehouse.

438
00:52:33,497 --> 00:52:37,058
No way. I'm not leaving here
until that bitch comes to me,

439
00:52:37,134 --> 00:52:38,897
even if it means staying here
for ten fucking years.

440
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:41,062
You're asking the impossible, dude.

441
00:52:41,138 --> 00:52:44,539
How's she gonna do that?
She'd never even imagine you were here.

442
00:52:44,608 --> 00:52:47,873
The truth is I don't have a clue what to do.
I'm totally hung up on her.

443
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:51,472
To the hell with that slag.
Don't you ever talk to her again.

444
00:52:51,548 --> 00:52:55,416
Not a single word. Heart of stone.
Tell the whore to go to hell.

445
00:52:55,486 --> 00:52:57,078
Blood Oath, asshole!

446
00:52:57,154 --> 00:52:59,384
- If you love her, forgive her.
- Don't be such a limp dick.

447
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:01,788
Can it, pussyman.
That you never do. Never ever.

448
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:03,417
Heart of stone, my man.

449
00:53:04,294 --> 00:53:06,455
- Blood oath, asshole.
- Chinese revenge.

450
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:08,020
Beat the crap out of her.

451
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:21,507
Come on, slave. Keep moving!

452
00:53:21,578 --> 00:53:25,014
In here, come on, move it!

453
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:15,063
Hi, you guys!

454
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:16,497
Sit there.

455
00:54:19,136 --> 00:54:20,467
What do you want to drink?

456
00:54:39,022 --> 00:54:40,421
Hello.

457
00:54:41,892 --> 00:54:43,189
Hello.

458
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:45,519
Hey, what's your name?

459
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:49,491
I said, what's your name?

460
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:11,510
Hey, what's with your friend?
How come he doesn't talk?

461
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:14,716
Oh, him? He's deaf.

462
00:55:22,532 --> 00:55:24,796
Come on, let's dance.

463
00:55:25,669 --> 00:55:27,227
Come on.

464
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,371
Dumb asshole.

465
00:56:41,611 --> 00:56:44,444
- Him, too.
- No, not him, leave him alone.

466
00:56:44,514 --> 00:56:45,640
Let's go.

467
00:56:47,784 --> 00:56:49,149
Come on.

468
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:52,544
Hurry! Hurry up!

469
00:57:28,158 --> 00:57:30,752
Dude, look!
Pull over, there goes Tigrillo.

470
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:34,263
Tigrillo! Tigrillo! Tigrillo!

471
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:36,731
Little whore!

472
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:41,737
Dude, give me a ride,
it's an emergency.

473
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:44,569
- Where are you going?
- To the beach hotel.

474
00:57:44,641 --> 00:57:47,405
Hotel, Tigrillo?

475
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:50,002
Tigrillo!

476
00:57:50,514 --> 00:57:53,312
No shit, Gonzo,
I'll tell you who I saw.

477
00:57:54,284 --> 00:57:56,377
Who?

478
00:57:56,453 --> 00:57:59,718
- Will you give me a ride?
- Scout's honor, dude.

479
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,724
I saw your girlfriend with this other dude.

480
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:05,759
- Where?
- In the restaurant.

481
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:06,921
Now give me that ride, dude.

482
00:58:06,997 --> 00:58:08,828
Piss off. Step on it, man.

483
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:12,699
- Let's go, come on.
- Please, it's very important.

484
00:58:12,769 --> 00:58:15,795
Step on it, will you, asshole?
Shut the fuck up.

485
00:58:27,384 --> 00:58:31,343
Pull over, asshole.
Stop you bastard, stop! I'm getting out.

486
00:59:06,957 --> 00:59:09,482
- What gives?
- Good evening.

487
00:59:10,861 --> 00:59:13,921
How do you do?
I'm Gonzalo. Pleased to meet you.

488
00:59:16,766 --> 00:59:20,634
- Hey.
- I'm Gonzalo. Nice meeting you.

489
01:00:03,747 --> 01:00:09,242
Shh. Quiet.
On the count of three, okay?

490
01:00:18,595 --> 01:00:22,691
A rose that's painted blue

491
01:00:24,234 --> 01:00:26,862
Is a reason

492
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:38,113
A simple little starfish

493
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:41,275
Is a reason

494
01:00:45,488 --> 01:00:50,084
It's easy to write a poem

495
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,254
If there's a motive

496
01:00:57,901 --> 01:01:03,362
It's easy to create new worlds

497
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,466
In my fantasy

498
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:14,644
Eyes that sparkle bathed in

499
01:01:14,718 --> 01:01:18,017
We definitely have to get away from here.
He's obviously a stubborn little prick.

500
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:26,090
Lips just yearning to be kissed

501
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:30,261
Are a reason

502
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:35,771
Eyes that sparkle bathed in light

503
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:38,273
Are a reason

504
01:01:41,444 --> 01:01:46,746
Lips just yearning to be kissed

505
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:49,580
Are a reason

506
01:01:51,354 --> 01:01:52,480
For you.

507
01:01:52,555 --> 01:01:56,685
And I stand here gazing at you

508
01:01:58,061 --> 01:02:02,498
Discovering among so many reasons

509
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:06,294
I know for certain, with you it's true

510
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:11,432
My best and only reason is you

511
01:02:18,214 --> 01:02:21,581
- That's the way, champ.
- You showed 'em who's boss.

512
01:02:22,585 --> 01:02:24,917
At least let's drink a toast.
Here's to you, man.

513
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:28,653
Why the fuck doesn't she come out?

514
01:02:41,738 --> 01:02:44,605
Fuck you! Hey, fuck you!

515
01:02:55,351 --> 01:02:59,720
Let's go to sleep.
Can I stay in your room?

516
01:03:00,957 --> 01:03:03,824
No, Jennifer, I said no.

517
01:03:03,893 --> 01:03:07,522
- Tigrillo!
- I said no, Tigrillio.

518
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:10,896
- Come on, let me.
- No.

519
01:03:11,901 --> 01:03:15,837
I don't want to leave you on your own
in case you do something stupid.

520
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:18,630
I said no.

521
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:23,935
Why don't we meet tomorrow instead?
I'll take you to lunch.

522
01:03:24,013 --> 01:03:26,777
- But are you going to be here?
- Of course I am.

523
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:30,212
If not, what can I do for you?

524
01:03:30,286 --> 01:03:32,447
Whatever you want.

525
01:03:32,522 --> 01:03:34,683
What don't you want?

526
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:37,851
Whatever you say.

527
01:03:37,927 --> 01:03:39,724
If you're not here, are you a faggot?

528
01:03:42,265 --> 01:03:43,994
Yes.

529
01:03:45,068 --> 01:03:47,628
If you're not here,
you're a shithead faggot?

530
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:04,418
Look.

531
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:06,247
- What?
- Did you see them?

532
01:04:06,322 --> 01:04:07,812
They're stuck together.

533
01:04:10,927 --> 01:04:14,488
They're screwing, aren't they?

534
01:04:14,564 --> 01:04:16,122
Nosy little kid.

535
01:04:18,134 --> 01:04:19,499
Mind your own business.

536
01:04:19,569 --> 01:04:22,094
Yeah, well, they should
rent a room, at least.

537
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:39,478
I'm so tired.

538
01:04:39,556 --> 01:04:41,524
Come on, I'll stay in the bathroom.

539
01:04:41,591 --> 01:04:43,718
I said no. Okay?

540
01:04:44,494 --> 01:04:46,325
- Come on.
- Here, take this.

541
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:48,887
No, I don't want it.
What's going on? No. No.

542
01:04:48,965 --> 01:04:49,989
Go on.

543
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:53,035
Why do you want to give me that
if we're going to see each other tomorrow?

544
01:04:53,102 --> 01:04:55,093
- Okay.
- I don't know, just take it.

545
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:58,299
No, no way. I said no.
You don't have to act so heavy.

546
01:04:58,374 --> 01:05:01,673
Besides, you know what? I'm not
going now. I'm staying right here.

547
01:05:01,744 --> 01:05:03,871
You are not sleeping here. Okay?

548
01:05:03,947 --> 01:05:06,006
- Now get going!
- You're a cold-hearted jerk.

549
01:05:06,082 --> 01:05:09,540
See you tomorrow.

550
01:05:09,619 --> 01:05:12,713
- Give me a cigarette.
- What?

551
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:15,155
Give me a cigarette.

552
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,708
Cigarettes kill, you know.

553
01:05:38,781 --> 01:05:40,373
Aren't you the funny one.

554
01:05:41,684 --> 01:05:43,208
Now go.

555
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:46,888
- Okay, but we have a date, don't we?
- I told you to go.

556
01:05:47,757 --> 01:05:49,952
- Do we?
- Yes. Now go.

557
01:05:53,363 --> 01:05:55,194
- Go on, off you go.
- It's definite?

558
01:05:55,265 --> 01:05:57,165
Stubborner than a mule.

559
01:05:58,434 --> 01:05:59,765
But it's definite, eh?

560
01:06:07,977 --> 01:06:11,003
- Tigrillo.
- In here.

561
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,377
That girl is really something.

562
01:06:17,954 --> 01:06:21,890
- Here's the Little Tiger. A winner, eh?
- Hi, guys.

563
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:26,695
- What happened?
- Come on, it's over now.

564
01:06:26,763 --> 01:06:29,425
- I'm not going out for some time.
- Why?

565
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:31,160
That Benny Hill got way out of line.

566
01:06:32,669 --> 01:06:35,297
- Everything?
- No, not everything.

567
01:06:36,973 --> 01:06:42,741
- What about yourself?
- Me? Okay, it was nice.

568
01:06:42,812 --> 01:06:46,976
- What you mean, nice?
- I met this nice old-timer.

569
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:51,248
- What did you get out of him?
- I don't know, nothing yet.

570
01:06:51,321 --> 01:06:55,257
- But why?
- I don't know, didn't feel like it.

571
01:06:55,325 --> 01:06:58,260
You're such a retard.
You liked him, didn't you?

572
01:06:58,328 --> 01:07:01,161
No way. I said he's cool.

573
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:04,961
- She likes the old-timer.
- Gross.

574
01:07:05,034 --> 01:07:06,661
I don't at all.

575
01:07:06,736 --> 01:07:08,670
Well, give me a cigarette.

576
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:15,200
Get the fuck away, Tigrillo!
What the hell? What have you done?

577
01:07:15,278 --> 01:07:17,405
- Let me see.
- All the way, just like that?

578
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,007
- What have you done, bitch?
- Nothing.

579
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:23,484
- Why did he give you this?
- I don't know.

580
01:07:23,553 --> 01:07:24,952
Play the fool, you whore.

581
01:07:25,021 --> 01:07:26,454
Give me that back. Fuck off.

582
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:31,789
- No, give it back to me.
- We did it!

583
01:07:31,861 --> 01:07:35,058
- We are set for good, Tigrillo.
- Give it back. I'm not kidding.

584
01:07:35,131 --> 01:07:39,693
- Not today, give it back.
- Take it!

585
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:42,363
- Stupid fuck!
- What's wrong with you?

586
01:07:42,438 --> 01:07:44,463
What a bitch.
Get the fuck away from here.

587
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,974
You're not a Yahaira anymore.
Who are you gonna hang with?

588
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:50,035
As if a care. I don't give a fuck.

589
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:37,588
- Step on it. Shut up!
- Gonzo!

590
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:41,255
It's urgent.

591
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:43,321
For real, Gonzo, for real!

592
01:08:55,745 --> 01:08:56,871
Jaime!

593
01:09:08,157 --> 01:09:10,455
What the fuck do you want?

594
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:13,154
You fucking whore.

595
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,222
Mind your own business.

596
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:18,595
Get away!

597
01:09:18,668 --> 01:09:19,828
Get away!

598
01:09:35,585 --> 01:09:36,950
Go away.

599
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:40,044
Get away!

600
01:09:42,959 --> 01:09:44,654
Fucking brat.

601
01:11:33,235 --> 01:11:35,533
- Hello, Fer.
- Hello, Pedro. How are you doing?

602
01:11:35,605 --> 01:11:37,470
Fine, thanks, and you?

603
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:40,532
- Is my dad around?
- I don't know, I haven't seen him.

604
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:42,043
Good, I'll give him a surprise.

605
01:11:43,112 --> 01:11:44,773
Dad?

606
01:11:57,126 --> 01:11:58,957
- So what's the plan?
- So what's the plan?

607
01:11:59,028 --> 01:12:02,794
What plan? Do we have a plan?

608
01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:05,425
- Yes, we do.
- Are we clear?

609
01:12:12,174 --> 01:12:14,802
Fernanda!

610
01:12:14,877 --> 01:12:17,744
- So what's the deal?
- So what's the deal?

611
01:12:17,813 --> 01:12:21,305
5:00, over the waterfront, right?
5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

612
01:12:21,384 --> 01:12:23,318
- 5:00, okay?
- Do you love me?

613
01:12:30,326 --> 01:12:31,884
Don't leave me.

614
01:13:01,824 --> 01:13:02,916
Martín.

615
01:13:02,992 --> 01:13:05,688
- Would you give this to Gonzalo?
- I'll give it to him.

616
01:13:08,497 --> 01:13:11,523
Don't you hide, bitch.

617
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:16,237
What is it with you?

618
01:13:16,305 --> 01:13:18,239
- What happened?
- Nothing, take it easy.

619
01:13:18,307 --> 01:13:21,037
Fucking nut case.
What's your problem, bitch?

620
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:22,873
You're gonna suffer!

621
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:24,503
Fuck it!

622
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:28,277
- You'll see.
- Gonzalo.

623
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:30,011
Gonzalo!

624
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:46,533
Start, piece of shit.

625
01:13:48,204 --> 01:13:50,900
- Gonzalo.
- Start, piece of shit.

626
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:53,407
- Fuck, shut up.
- Gonzalo.

627
01:13:59,715 --> 01:14:02,513
Fuck off, get the fuck away!

628
01:14:02,585 --> 01:14:05,213
- Don't take it.
- Let me go.

629
01:14:50,366 --> 01:14:52,596
- Have you seen Chano around?
- No.

630
01:14:53,669 --> 01:14:56,968
If you get to see him, let him know
I'm going to beat the shit out of him.

631
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:00,372
What's so funny, little fuck?
Don't be a fool.

632
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:46,418
- What's the story, asshole?
- What's what?

633
01:15:46,488 --> 01:15:49,218
- You think you're something else, fucker?
- Drop it, Gonzo.

634
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:52,488
- I don't have any beef with you.
- I do, what do you think about that?

635
01:15:55,231 --> 01:15:56,528
That's tough.

636
01:15:58,667 --> 01:16:01,135
- Easy, Gonzo.
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

637
01:16:01,203 --> 01:16:07,039
- Fuck off, asshole.
- Stop it.

638
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:10,078
Stop it. It's okay.

639
01:16:10,145 --> 01:16:13,205
- Stop it.
- Enough!

640
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:29,854
Stop it, Chano! Let go!

641
01:16:29,932 --> 01:16:35,131
Stop, Chano! Let him go, Chano!

642
01:16:35,204 --> 01:16:36,933
This guy was all fueled up.
I didn't start it.

643
01:16:38,841 --> 01:16:40,900
- I'll meet you at the waterfront.
- I'm not going. Give me my keys.

644
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:42,910
I'll be waiting at the waterfront.

645
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:45,446
- I'm not going.
- You are.

646
01:16:52,721 --> 01:16:54,245
Stand up, Gonzalo.

647
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:01,787
Stand up, Gonzalo.

648
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:03,525
I can do it by myself.

649
01:17:49,078 --> 01:17:51,478
- Shit!
- What is wrong with you?

650
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:54,143
Get fucked!

651
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:29,050
Gonzalo, calm down.

652
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,148
Stop it, Gonzalo.

653
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,435
I'm fucking off out of here.
I'm going to fucking hell.

654
01:18:47,503 --> 01:18:49,198
Cut the crap.

655
01:19:47,629 --> 01:19:50,120
The minute I see you I think about you
with that asshole fucker.

656
01:19:53,268 --> 01:19:54,758
- Gonzalo.
- Fuck off.

657
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:01,309
Okay, Gonzalo, I'll fuck off,
but first there are things I want to say

658
01:20:01,376 --> 01:20:02,968
so maybe you'll understand.

659
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:08,745
Listen, you are such an idiot that you
don't realize that this is all your fault.

660
01:20:08,817 --> 01:20:09,875
You slut!

661
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:11,943
Let go of me!

662
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:16,290
Let go of me, Gonzalo!

663
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:24,328
That's my T-shirt. Don't think
you're gonna take my shirt with you.

664
01:20:27,436 --> 01:20:29,631
Didn't you hate my T-shirt!
Give it back!

665
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:30,763
Give it back, fuckwit.

666
01:20:30,839 --> 01:20:32,466
What's happened to you, Gonzalo?
You're a monster!

667
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:35,066
What happened to me?
What happened is I met you.

668
01:20:35,978 --> 01:20:37,502
That's what happened to me.

669
01:20:39,414 --> 01:20:41,348
Why did you do it?

670
01:20:49,091 --> 01:20:50,922
I don't know.

671
01:20:52,294 --> 01:20:54,228
I don't even know
why I'm talking to you.

672
01:20:58,567 --> 01:21:00,626
Gonzalo. Wait.

673
01:22:42,571 --> 01:22:46,063
What do you want? Eh?

674
01:22:47,776 --> 01:22:50,006
We'll drink this and then go
our separate ways.

675
01:25:23,398 --> 01:25:26,526
- Wait.
- What's up?

676
01:25:26,601 --> 01:25:29,536
Someone's coming.

677
01:25:29,604 --> 01:25:33,597
- Who?
- I don't know. I can't see.

678
01:25:42,684 --> 01:25:43,776
Tigrillo?

679
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:05,332
Hi, kiddo, how are you?
Are you still angry with me?

680
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:12,806
Would you forgive me? You can
join the Yahairas again if you want.

681
01:26:14,416 --> 01:26:16,577
Cool.

682
01:26:16,651 --> 01:26:18,209
Is he in there?

683
01:26:20,388 --> 01:26:21,446
Uh-huh.

684
01:26:21,523 --> 01:26:24,321
We woke up with the Putazo brothers.

685
01:26:24,392 --> 01:26:28,021
They are inviting us for breakfast.
So, you want to come?

686
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:30,656
- No, I'll pass on that.
- Is something wrong?

687
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:35,631
No, I'm in a kind of weird head space.

688
01:26:35,704 --> 01:26:37,831
Do you want to go to the beach later?

689
01:26:40,008 --> 01:26:41,873
Don't you want to be
a Yahaira anymore?

690
01:26:44,145 --> 01:26:48,309
No, I don't think so.
I'm gonna go away.

691
01:26:48,383 --> 01:26:52,012
- Where to?
- Not sure yet.

692
01:26:56,124 --> 01:26:59,855
- Talk about antisocial. Take care, eh?
- You, too.

693
01:28:27,549 --> 01:28:29,073
Oh, hey.

694
01:28:31,987 --> 01:28:33,887
Now, that's real nice to see.

695
01:28:36,391 --> 01:28:38,018
Fuckin' Ceviche!
