  <plot><![CDATA[Inogashira's sleepiness caused him to make a mistake during his out-of-town meeting with a client. He was already on his way home at a stop-over in Choshi, Chiba when he realized he had taken the wrong product item with him. Since he could not go back to his client until the afternoon of the next day, he decides to stay overnight in the coastal town of Iioka. Before he checks into a guest house, he strolls around, checking out a sweets cafe called "Light House." The next day, the relaxing view of the Pacific Ocean inspires Inogashira to have a seafood feast at a surfers' favorite hang-out called "Tsuchiya"...]]></plot>
