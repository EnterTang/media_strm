  <plot><![CDATA[Summer's here, and the Kyoritsu University sumo club is participating in a training camp. Ryota, Shun, and Ren treat it as a fun vacation, but once they arrive, they learn that they will be training with Hokuto Gakuin, the champions of the sumo league. Exhausted by the rigorous training, Ryota and the others leave the training grounds in search of some fun. They find a bar where they eat and fall asleep, but find themselves unable to pay the bill in the morning. Told that the meal would be free if they can win one sumo match, they are brought to a place where three elderly men and children are training. However, Ryota and the others are soundly defeated. They then receive advice from a certain man to help them improve their skills. On that very night, Yoshioka confesses to Honoka.]]></plot>
