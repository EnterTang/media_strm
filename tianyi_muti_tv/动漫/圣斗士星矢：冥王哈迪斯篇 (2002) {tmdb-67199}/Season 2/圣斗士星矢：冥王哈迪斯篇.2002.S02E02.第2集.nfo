  <plot><![CDATA[Seiya and Shun reach the First Prison and encounter Markino, a skeleton that leads them to Balrog Rene, who judges the dead and sends them to their appropriate hell. Markino is then killed by Rene, using his Fire Whip, because of him not being quiet. Rene proceeds by showing Seiya his past crimes during his life with Reincarnation. Seiya is shown childhood memories, and the opponents he has defeated. He then tries to explain his actions, but Rene ignores him and sends him to the First Valley of the Sixth Prison, where people who have use violence against others in their lives boil in a lake of boiling blood. Shun rescues him, however Rene notices something strange about Shun. Shun tries to justify the actions of humanity, but is sliced to pieces with the Fire Whip. Rene is then scolded by Hades for cutting his body. In panic, he searches for the body, but Rhadamanthys appears, pointing out it was an illusion. Seiya and Shun are fine, wondering what happened. Rene discovers who made the illusion, Gemini Kanon, who wanted Rene to lead him to Hades. Kanon then destroys Rene with no difficulty and confronts Rhadamanthys about why he defeated Aiolia, Mu and Milo so easily, because of a barrier at Hades' castle that lowered their strength to 1/10. Seiya and Shun arrive, but Kanon attacks them, reminding Shun to be stop being sentimental, in order to save the innocent. He then tells them to go find Athena. Rhadamanthys attacks Kanon, but he counters with the Imperial Satanic Illusion to control him and kill Hades. He is interrupted by Specters who tell Rhadamanthys that Pandora wants to see him. As the Judge leaves, Kanon destroys the lower Specters with Galaxian Explosion.]]></plot>
