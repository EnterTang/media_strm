1
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:07,250
Mum!

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,000
Dad!

3
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:18,750
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:26,041
- Bluey!

5
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:30,417
Ahh! Ohh!

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,667
-Almost.
-Ooh!

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,583
-Almost!
-Come on, Bluey!

8
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:33,709
Almost! Got it!

9
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,625
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

10
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:36,000
I reached it!

11
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,333
Alright, bumblenuts,
I'm out of here.

12
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:38,458
- Nooo!
-Yow!

13
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:40,250
I've gotta go to work!

14
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,458
No!
No work!

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,166
Quick, Bingo, we need a plan.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,041
How are we gonna
get Dad to stay?

17
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,000
Think, Bingo, think.

18
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,083
Um, um...

19
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,792
My brain can't
think of anything.

20
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,000
I know!

21
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:05,041
But, Dad, you can't leave
without having breakfast!

22
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,458
Huh?

23
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:07,792
We were gonna make
breakfast for you.

24
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,333
Yeah!

25
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:12,250
And you always say,
you have to eat breakfast.

26
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,333
That is true.

27
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:15,083
I am always
saying that.

28
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,917
-Okay.
- Hooray!

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,083
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Trampoline.

30
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,166
I'll just have
some toast.

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,667
Hooray, toast!

32
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,917
I'll just get some bread.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,333
Now, just bung these
in the toaster.

34
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:34,917
Piece of bread one
and piece of bread two.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,333
-Ka-ching!

36
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,875
And now, just peruse
my newspaper

37
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,417
and wait for my toast
to be perfectly --

38
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,417
- Ka-chunk!

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,542
What?
Toast is ready!

40
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:47,709
That wasn't very long.

41
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,834
Ugh!
Nyum nyum nyum nyum!

42
00:01:49,917 --> 00:01:52,875
This toast is raw!

43
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,917
Again, toaster!

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,500
No, no, no,
I've really got to go.

45
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,500
No way!
You have to have some...

46
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,709
Um, some...

47
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,875
Argh, I can't think!

48
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,458
-Juice!
-Yeah, juice!

49
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:11,667
Juice! Juice!
Juice! Juice!

50
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,917
Well, I do like a good juice.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,291
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

52
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,792
Mm-mm-mm-mm,
mmm, mmm.

53
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:22,875
Now, what have we got
in the fridge here for a juice?

54
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,250
Psst!
What are you?

55
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,500
Oh, oh, uh,
pineapple!

56
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,125
No, a blueberry.
Black.

57
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,667
-A blackberry!
-Got it.

58
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,709
What about you?

59
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,458
What fruit do you love?

60
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:33,750
Banana.

61
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,875
I'm a banana!

62
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,125
Banana and blueberries. Perfect!

63
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,542
-Blackberries!
-Oh, blackberries.

64
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,959
Blackberries.
Perfect!

65
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,834
Okay, let's just get them
in the juicer.

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,834
Wait, what fruit
do you hate?

67
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,000
Ooh, rockmelon.

68
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,208
Bleaghh!
Hee hee!

69
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,500
I'm a rockmelon!

70
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,417
Yeah,
and I'm a fly.

71
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,875
-Bzz, bzz!
-Oh, no.

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,208
Okay,
let's get the lid on.

73
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:01,333
Clunk!
Now, switch the juicer on.

74
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,291
Okay, there we go.

75
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,125
Lid off.
Let's have a taste!

76
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,792
Gulp gulp gulp gulp gulp!

77
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,834
Ahh!

78
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:12,917
Bleaghh!

79
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,709
Rockmelon and flies?!

80
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,291
Yuck!

81
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,750
Again -- juice!
Again -- juice!

82
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,291
Nah, kids, that's it for me.

83
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,709
I've got to get to work.

84
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:24,792
No!

85
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:25,917
You need to have some...

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,709
-eggs!
-Yeah!

87
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,709
Well, I am
off the carbs.

88
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,166
-Hee hee! It's working!
-It's working!

89
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,291
Okay.
I'll have some eggs.

90
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,834
Hooray!

91
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:36,959
Quickly.

92
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,792
Okay, I just need to crack them
in the frying pan.

93
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,333
Boing! Boing!

94
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:44,750
Ah ha ha!

95
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:46,291
That was an easy one.

96
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,667
One egg cracked.

97
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,709
Just need to crack the other one.

98
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,667
Ba-boom!
Ba-boom!

99
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,500
This one has a tough shell.

100
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,041
Must be free range or something.

101
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,750
-Come...on...egg!

102
00:03:57,917 --> 00:03:59,583
I want breakfast!

103
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:00,959
Ha!

104
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,041
There it goes.

105
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,625
Have us scrambled!

106
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,417
You got it.

107
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,333
Scramble scramble scramble,
scrambleee!

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,417
Right.
That's my brecky sorted.

109
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,667
Now I've gotta get
to work, kids.

110
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,667
-No!
-No!

111
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,959
Wait!

112
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:19,875
-Yaah!
-Yaah!

113
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,333
-Get off!
-Yaah!

114
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:23,291
You're not leaving!

115
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,709
Yes, I am!

116
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,583
Chilli!

117
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,125
Come on, kiddos.

118
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,500
You have to let Dad
go to work.

119
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,959
-Aw!
-Aw!

120
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,125
Sorry, kids.

121
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,291
I really do have to go.

122
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,583
Dad?

123
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:55,667
Yes, mate?

124
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,834
I don't want you to leave.

125
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:00,125
Come here, kid.

126
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,000
I want you to stay
and play with us.

127
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,333
I know you do.

128
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,417
I have to go do my job, though.

129
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
And you have to do yours.

130
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,500
What? I don't have a job.

131
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, you do.

132
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,625
Really? What is it?

133
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,250
Making up games.

134
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,417
Oh!

135
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,417
And making your bed,
doing the dishes,

136
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,917
and setting the table!

137
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,041
But making up games is more
important than you think.

138
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,667
Okay, Dad.

139
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,625
Bye, Dad.

140
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:48,291
Bluey, I don't know
what to play.

141
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,750
I know.
Come with me!

142
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:05,500
Ohh!

143
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,750
I'll kink the hose!

144
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,375
Aaaaah!

145
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,166
Good one, Bingo.

146
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,583
What's going to happen?

147
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,792
I don't know.

148
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,333
-Ready?
-Yeah!

149
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,458
Unkink!

150
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,959
I know!
We can be lettuce!

151
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,500
And this is
a big salad spinner!

152
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,208
Yeah, getting washed,
ready to eat!

153
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,208
That looks like a fun game.

154
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,625
Mum, come and have
some salad for lunch!

155
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:47,417
We know how much you like salad.

156
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,625
-Yeah, alright.
- Yeah!

157
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,333
Whoooaaa!

158
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,458
Whoa!

159
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:56,625
Who made up this game?

160
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,125
Me!

161
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,667
Nice job, Bluey!
