1
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:07,291
Mum!

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,041
Dad!

3
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:18,750
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,959
- Bluey!

5
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,250
Oh, my house is so fancy.

6
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,250
Bluey, this is <i>my </i>caravan.

7
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,083
Ooh, hello, butler.

8
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,583
That cup is mine.

9
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,208
- Muffin!

10
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,500
I'm just using it for the game!

11
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,166
Give it to me!

12
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,500
Breakfast is ready, milady.

13
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,750
That frying pan is mine!

14
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:49,917
Muffin!

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,959
It's all mine!

16
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:55,208
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Camping.

17
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,166
Can you believe it?

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,375
The butler kicked us out.

19
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,291
Oh, we'll have to live in the forest.

20
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:06,917
Not this one. She hasn't
had a bath in three days.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,083
I like stinking!

22
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,458
Goodbye, sweet, stinky cook.

23
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,083
Oh, I'll have to make a house
out of sticks.

24
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,250
Bonjour.

25
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,250
Hi.

26
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>Tu veux jouer avec moi?</i>

27
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,583
Huh?

28
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,875
<i>Est-ce qu'on joue ensemble?</i>

29
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,083
I'm not really sure
what you're talking about.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,458
Oh, thanks.

31
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:34,208
These are for my house.

32
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,709
My butler kicked me out.

33
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,917
<i>Oh! Une maison.</i>
<i>C'est super!</i>

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,834
<i>On pourrait prendre les plantes</i>
<i>pour faire les murs.</i>

35
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,834
Oh, yeah.
Those can be the walls.

36
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:48,542
<i>♪ Doo, doo, doo-doo-doo ♪</i>

37
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:52,250
<i>♪ Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo,</i>
<i>doo-doo ♪</i>

38
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,250
<i>Oh, c'est très beau!</i>

39
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,709
Now we need food to eat.

40
00:01:56,792 --> 00:02:01,208
<i>On pourrait planter cette graine</i>
<i>pour faire pousser des fruits.</i>

41
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,250
Hey, yeah,
we can plant this seed,

42
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,709
like farmers!

43
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,083
This will grow into a big tree
with fruit on it.

44
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,959
<i>Ca va prendre beaucoup de temps</i>
<i>pour grandir.</i>

45
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,250
There.

46
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,917
Hmm.
Might take a while.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,583
We need something to eat now.

48
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,166
- Moooor!

49
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,250
Hide!

50
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,083
Moooor!

51
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,667
It's a wild pig!

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,208
<i>Sanglier!</i>

53
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,333
Bluey! Dinner!

54
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:34,709
Jean Luc!

55
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:36,125
<i>C'est le dîner!</i>

56
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,333
I'll see you tomorrow?

57
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,083
<i>A demain.</i>

58
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,458
Oh! My name's Bluey.

59
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:42,959
<i>Salut, </i>Bluey.

60
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,417
<i>Moi, c'est Jean Luc.</i>

61
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,166
See you tomorrow, Jean Luc.

62
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,375
<i>♪ Doo, doo-ooh, doo-doo-doo ♪</i>

63
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,208
<i>♪ Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo ♪</i>

64
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:58,291
<i>♪ Doo-ooh, doo-doo-doo ♪</i>

65
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,375
Jean Luc!

66
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,500
Ca va, Bluey?

67
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,792
Are you ready to play?

68
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,000
We have to catch
that wild pig today,

69
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,583
or we'll have no food
for the winter.

70
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,000
Moooor!

71
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,166
<i>Je vais attrapper ses jambes!</i>

72
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,125
I'll scare him, and you get him
when he runs away!

73
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,041
You cheeky pig!

74
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,834
That wasn't the plan,
Jean Luc.

75
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:35,417
You were supposed
to cut him off.

76
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
<i>Oh, j'ai pensé que</i>
<i>tu veux venir de l'autre coté!</i>

77
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,083
Dinnertime!

78
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,834
<i>A plus tard!</i>

79
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,041
Jean Luc!

80
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,125
<i>Bonjour!</i>

81
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,041
<i>Aw, toujours rien!</i>

82
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,125
Hmm.
No fruit tree yet.

83
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,750
We need a better plan
to catch that wild pig!

84
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,959
<i>Ceci c'est notre</i>
<i>dernière chance!</i>

85
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,542
I've got an idea!

86
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,083
My Dad taught me
how to do this.

87
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:15,000
Wild pig.

88
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,208
<i>Sanglier.</i>

89
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,959
Me.

90
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,041
Toi.

91
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,583
You.

92
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:24,959
Yeah!

93
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,542
You get him from behind!

94
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,917
Moooor!

95
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,583
Moooor!

96
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:36,750
Yaaaah!

97
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,917
Whooo!

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,709
Bluey!
- Jean Luc!

99
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,917
Bye, Jean Luc.
See you tomorrow.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,208
<i>Non, pas demain matin.</i>

101
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:57,583
<i>Au revoir, </i>Bluey.

102
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:05,208
Ah!
A little tree!

103
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,792
Jean Luc!
Come quickly!

104
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,750
Jean Luc?

105
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,583
Jean Luc!

106
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,041
Jean Luc?!

107
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,166
Mum, do you know
where Jean Luc is?

108
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,667
His tent's not there.

109
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,792
Oh, yes, I saw them packing up.

110
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,208
What?

111
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,125
They must have left
early this morning.

112
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,625
You mean they're gone?

113
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,125
I'm afraid so, sweetheart.

114
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,000
Mum, I need a wee.

115
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,875
Okay, let's do a bush wee.

116
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,542
Where's the bunny night light?

117
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,625
Here it is.

118
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:49,875
Moooor!

119
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,375
Do you need a wee, too, Bluey?

120
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,542
No, but can I come anyway?

121
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,083
The more the merrier.

122
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:57,834
Mum?

123
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,041
Yeah?

124
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,000
Why did Jean Luc have to go?

125
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,208
Their holiday was over, honey.

126
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,208
But I want to keep playing with him.

127
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,083
He was my friend.

128
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,709
Well, look.

129
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:11,000
Sometimes, special people
come into our lives,

130
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,917
stay for a bit,
and then they have to go.

131
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,417
But that's sad.

132
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,917
It is.

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,834
But the bit where they <i>were </i>here
was happy, wasn't it?

134
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:21,041
Yeah.

135
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,208
We caught a wild pig together.

136
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,375
Maybe that makes it all worth it.

137
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,000
Will I ever see him again?

138
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,625
Well, you never know.

139
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,875
The world's a magical place.

140
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:35,250
Whoa!

141
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,375
Finished.

142
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,375
Oooh, stars.

143
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,583
Pretty.

144
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:52,041
Bluey,
that book's mine!

145
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,917
I know it's yours, Muffin.

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,792
I'm just borrowing it.

147
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,917
Hello, Bluey.
