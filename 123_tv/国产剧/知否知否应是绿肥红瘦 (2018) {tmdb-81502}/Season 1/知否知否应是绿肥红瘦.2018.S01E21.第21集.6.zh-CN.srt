1
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:07,333
Mum!

2
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,083
Dad!

3
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:18,792
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:26,041
- Bluey!

5
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,917
Once, there were
two sisters --

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,875
big sister, hi!

7
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:33,500
-And little sister.
- Hi!

8
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,500
And also,
a little fairy.

9
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,625
Oh, yes!

10
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:39,041
And also, a little fairy.

11
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,291
-Eeee!
-Whoa!

12
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:41,959
Be careful, little sister!

13
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,500
You'll have someone's eye out
with that thing.

14
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,625
And the big sister
was no fun at all.

15
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:49,917
Hey! I'm lots of fun!

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,291
Nuh-uh!

17
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:56,000
Anyway, it was winter
and very cold.

18
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,750
Brrrr!

19
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:01,750
We need to find somewhere warm
to sleep, little sister!

20
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:04,917
I know a place that's got
the softest, warmest beds

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,458
in the whole world.

22
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:08,542
Where are they, little fairy?

23
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,834
Beyond the Blue Mountains!

24
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:13,500
Yay! The Blue Mountains!

25
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:17,834
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called the </i>Blue Mountains.

26
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:21,125
No way are we going
to the Blue Mountains.

27
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,417
It's too dangerous!

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,250
I told you she was no fun.

29
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,291
Race you!

30
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,709
-Hey!

31
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:31,500
-Whoa, look!

32
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,291
Stay back, little sister!

33
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,709
We don't know what that is!

34
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:38,250
Don't worry. It's friendly.

35
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,000
Brrr!

36
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,000
We'd best get going.

37
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,000
Hooray!

38
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,000
Hooray!

39
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:47,208
This is too steep.

40
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,667
Oh, big sister, don't be
a stick in the mud.

41
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:56,208
What a view!

42
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,041
How do we get down?

43
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,417
We slide! Whee!

44
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,208
Whee!

45
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,542
Okay.

46
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,500
Here we goooo!

47
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,208
Whee!

48
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,709
Yeah!
That was fun!

49
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,291
It's so soft and squishy!

50
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,917
Boing!
Boing!

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,834
It is soft and squishy,
isn't it, little sister?

52
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:28,834
It's like we're bouncing
on a massive pikelet.

53
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:30,917
Grrr!

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,375
- What's happening?

55
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,792
Aah!

56
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,750
How are we gonna get past
this big wall?

57
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,959
It's too high to climb!

58
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:45,083
We'll never find the softest,
warmest beds in the whole world.

59
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,917
My sweeties,

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,125
there's a secret spot somewhere here.

61
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,500
We just have to find it.

62
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,125
Oh, yes!

63
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:56,125
And if we scratch it, it makes
the wall come tumbling down.

64
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,458
Hee, okay!

65
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,750
You try over there.

66
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:08,375
This is the spot!

67
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,375
Yeah, that's the spot!

68
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,375
You got it!

69
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,375
Come on!

70
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,709
Aah!

71
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,750
Run for your lives!

72
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,333
Hooray!

73
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,875
Yeah!

74
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,291
Oh, I'm having so much fun,
little sister.

75
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,709
Maybe I do just need to relax
and enjoy myself more.

76
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,667
I wonder why I ever stopped
in the first place.

77
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,583
Well, hello!

78
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,166
I am a kindly fox.

79
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, look at this cute little fella.

80
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,208
You wouldn't be looking
for the warmest, softest beds

81
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,709
in the whole world, would you?

82
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,750
We are!

83
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,333
Well, you're in luck.

84
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,041
I can show you the way.

85
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,375
Oh, great!

86
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,917
Did you hear that, kids?

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,959
Big sister, I think
he's a cheeky fox.

88
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,125
A what?!

89
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,625
No, he's a <i>kindly </i>fox.

90
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:01,750
He said so.

91
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:04,667
Ooh, look at his cute, little tail.

92
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,917
I'm not so sure.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,875
Oh, come on, little sister.

94
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,917
Now who's being boring?

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,333
Hey!

96
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:16,291
Little sister, we need
to find the softest,

97
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,333
warmest beds in the whole world,

98
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:20,333
otherwise, we'll freeze.

99
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:22,333
Oh, all right.

100
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:23,917
Okay, kindly fox.

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,291
We'd love you to show us the way.

102
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,959
Oh, very good!

103
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,792
Right this way.

104
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,500
I'm usually a real worry wart,

105
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,041
but this trek
to the Blue Mountains

106
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,834
has really shown me
how to relax and have fun.

107
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,875
Oh, splendid!

108
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,959
I've got my eye on you, Mr Fox.

109
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,333
That sister of yours
is hard work, isn't she?

110
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:47,834
She sure is.

111
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,875
It's a cave!

112
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,875
Oh, wow, it stinks!

113
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,125
Yeah, it stinks!

114
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,125
I'm sure
it's not that bad.

115
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,208
Oh, kindly fox,

116
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,375
is there something
wrong with your voice?

117
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,083
Uh, no,

118
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,709
I just like to talk
like this sometimes.

119
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:09,875
Very strange.

120
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,041
Well, we best get going.

121
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,959
Are you coming, too, kindly fox?

122
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,709
Uh, I actually have to go

123
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:19,917
and buy some more...
hand cream.

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay. Thanks for your help.

125
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,000
Yep.
In you go.

126
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,750
I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

127
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:29,250
Oh, quiet, little sister.

128
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,291
Now who's a stick in the mud?

129
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,875
Last one into the cave's
a rotten egg!

130
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,792
Wait, big sister!

131
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,834
Ah! I'm winning! Yeah!

132
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:40,750
Aah!

133
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,959
Big sister!

134
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,625
Help, little sister!

135
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:49,041
He's licking me!

136
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,458
Let me out!

137
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:51,917
It was a trick!

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,542
What are you gonna do?!

139
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,208
You!

140
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,083
You <i>are </i>a cheeky fox!

141
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,500
That's it.

142
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,458
No one traps my big sister.

143
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:02,458
Hyah!

144
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:03,500
Raah!

145
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,917
Aah!

146
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,583
Wait for it!

147
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,208
Wait for it!

148
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,458
Bleahh!

149
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,333
Ohh!

150
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:15,083
Yeah!

151
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,875
Ew.
I'm all slimy!

152
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,458
Big sister!

153
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:23,291
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe!

154
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,834
I promise I'll never say
you're boring ever again.

155
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:29,375
Oh, I was so busy
trying to be fun,

156
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,959
I forgot the most important thing
big sisters are meant to do.

157
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,250
What's that?

158
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,250
Look after their little sisters.

159
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,792
Look!

160
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,792
The softest, warmest beds
in the whole world!

161
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:42,750
Yeah!

162
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,166
We found them!

163
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,750
Hooray!

164
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,792
Oh, it's so soft.

165
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:52,625
And look, there's enough wax in here
to make a hundred candles!

166
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:53,834
Ohh!

167
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,208
And they all slept
happily ever after.
