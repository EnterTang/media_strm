Thank you for watching

Paris, France is just over
40 square miles in area.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,810
That's also about the size of
an oil spill that's spreading

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,490
in the East China Sea.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,920
It started when an
Iranian oil tanker

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,990
collided with a
freighter from Hong Kong.

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,180
That happened on January 7.

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,180
The oil ship caught
fire and stayed afloat,

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,740
burning until it
exploded and sank

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,400

of its 32 crew members

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,300
died in the accident.

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,220
The tanker was carrying
136,000 tons of condensate oil.

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,340
It's a type used in jet fuel,
and it's lighter in color

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,380
than the thick black
crude oil that's

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,450
been seen in other oil spills.

22
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,330
But though environmentalists
say some of the oil on board

23
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,210
the ship probably
burned off in the fire,

24
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,920
they're concerned
that what remained

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,080
could still hurt marine
life in the area,

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,000
like whales and porpoises.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They're also worried that the
fuel that powered the ship

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,680
will leak as well, and that
could make things worse.

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,110

to stay relatively

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,445
the spill east toward Japan.

But there's a lot of
uncertainty about the currency.

It's volatile--
highly changeable,

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,290
like all cryptocurrencies,
and an example of that

49
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,560
played out in recent days
when Bitcoin's value took

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,790
a nosedive, temporarily
dropping to below $10,000

51

hit Australia last year,

67

is a nasty one.

This is the first year that's

that the Centers

has been monitoring the flu.

73
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,360
One reason-- this year's
vaccine doesn't appear

74
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,850
to be very effective
against the actual flu

75
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,350
virus that's spreading.

76
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,500
Experts predict it'll
be about 30% effective.

77
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,100
In recent years, the vaccine's
been between 40% and 50%

78
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,220

an exception in the 2014

vaccine was only 19%

reports that this season

82
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,440
is looking a lot like that one.

83
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,590
The hopeful news is that experts
think the flu season may be

84
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,050

point now and that it's

It's a dead virus.

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,149
It can't actually cause flu.

92
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,519
Why do people feel sort
of crummy afterward?

93
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,250
It's because the flu vaccine
is actually working and making

94
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,770
your immune system
fire up, get ready,

95
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,220
and recognize if it actually
sees the flu, how to kill it.

96
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,550
No, it's not 100%
fail-safe, but it's still

97
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,230
going to offer a
lot of protection

98
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,890
so that you're not going to be
as sick, as likely to get sick,

99
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,720
or if you do get sick,
have a shorter duration.

104
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,300
You can't catch the
flu from just simply

105
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,800
being outside in the cold.

106
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,990
But it does raise the
question, why are there so many

107
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,660
more flu cases in
the winter months?

108
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,990
You're likely to stay indoors
more, so if one person is sick,

109
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,640
more people are
likely to get sick.

110
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,990
The sun is lower in the
sky, and as a result,

111
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,680
you have less vitamin D actually
being produced in your body.

112
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,650
Your immune system starts to
get suppressed a little bit.

113
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,480
You're more likely to
get sick with the flu.

114
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,210
The winter months tend
to be lower humidity.

115
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,310
Viruses like the flu virus,
they like lower humidity.

116

170
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,650
than 300,000 wheels of cheese.

171
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,770
That's currently worth more
than 160 million euros.

172
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,537
Without proper care, cheese
could lose its value.

[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

174
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,310
Well, Roberto, sounds to
me like the cow, the bank,

175
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,260
and the cheese
are in good hands.

CARL AZUZ: If you're aquaphobic,
bathophobic, or claustrophobic,

178
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,330
turn away, because we're
diving deep into what

179
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,710
experts believe is the world's
biggest underwater cave.

180
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,540
It was identified
when divers recently

181
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,990
found out that two
flooded caverns in Mexico

182
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,670
were actually connected.

183
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,240
The cave is 216 miles
long and scientists

184
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,740
hope it will help
them learn more

185
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,049
about the ancient
Mayan civilization,

186
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,000
because their
settlements apparently

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,130
ran along this cave system.

188
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,580
Of course, if you're more of a
Copernicus than a cavernicus--

189
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,799
if you'd rather be
starry-eyed than watery-eyed,

190
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,020
you'd rather aim
high than dive deep,

191
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,070
and you tend to cave
under water pressure,

192
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,420
you stalag-might want to drift
elsewhere for va-cave-tion.

193
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,220
This kind of dive
is for those who

194
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,620
tank their spelunkey
stars when something

195
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,890
leaves them breathless.

196
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,780
Have a great weekend.
