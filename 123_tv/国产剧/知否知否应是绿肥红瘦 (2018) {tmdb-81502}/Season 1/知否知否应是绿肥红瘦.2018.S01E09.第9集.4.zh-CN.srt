00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,230
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,070
Episode 43

3
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,350
Wife,I will take off my clothes.

4
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,370
Look at this long and straight leg of mine.

5
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,520
Stop looking at it.

6
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,600
You can't finish reading today.
Just continue tomorrow.

7
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,620
There are a lot of spies from  the marquis 
manor.How can I not be  nervous?

8
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:02,130
Danju said that a new maidservant today

9
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,390
wanted to enter your inner study to attend
to you, but got scolded away by her.

10
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,840
And this Nanny Lai isn't
that easy to deal with.

11
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,650
When she was not doing
anything, she would go around

12
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:15,650
the garden and would
enter any door she sees,

13
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,050
would pull any people she
sees and ask around.

14
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,369
I can't really stuff her
mouth to shut her up, right?

15
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:22,540
It's better to drive her
away as soon as possible.

16
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,720
How come you can't just stuff
her mouth and make her leave?

17
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,610
I'll tell Shitou to lock
that old woman up tomorrow.

18
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,160
Aren't you oppressing the old and weak?

19
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,100
If that gets out, do you still
want you reputation or not?

20
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,450
How about when I go to court tomorrow,
I'll leave some guards here.

21
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,570
In the places that you
think are very important,

22
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,810
I'll leave two people holding
blades to guard there.

23
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,420
Let's see who still dares
to randomly touch things.

24
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,420
Looks like that Big Madam Qin is attacking
me from two angles at the same time.

25
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,990
Sending me some old crafty servants
to add to my trouble on one hand,

26
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,799
and then simultaneously sending
some beautiful ones to

27
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,530
seduce you. She really gave
a lot of thought in this.

28
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,740
Beautiful?

29
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,290
How beautiful?

30
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,150
Of course, they are indeed quite pretty.

31
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,630
How about...tomorrow...

32
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,000
...I'll let them attend to us when we
eat and you'll be able to see them.

33
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,640
I'm just joking with you, but look at you.

34
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,910
You got serious with it.

35
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,381
Either way, you're
going to take in a

36
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,150
concubine in the future,
and I'm not jealous.

37
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,200
I'm just worried that those
people are inappropriate.

38
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,900
Why are you not jealous?

39
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,950
Even that stepmother of mine, who can
really pretend and endure things,

40
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,320
would still argue with my
father about such things.

41
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,650
Why are you not jealous?

42
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,850
That jealous of hers
must be pretentious too!

43
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,096
In my house, there's this
Little Mother Lin of mine.

44
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:12,110
When she gets jealous,
it's really so colorful.

45
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,480
Isn't it all just to make their
husband think that in their heart,

46
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,340
he is so precious and important?

47
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,730
You little fox! Can't you even pretend?

48
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,360
If you dare take in a concubine,

49
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
I'll hit you with a huge
pole and drive you out!

50
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,590
I'll never allow you to enter my room.

51
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,860
Okay! Okay!

52
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,320
That's how my good wife should be!
Being jealous is good!

53
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,860
Come. Come. Let me read that for you.

54
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,010
I...let me help you! Let me help you!
Come...

55
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,950
Thank you, Sister.

56
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,560
- So heavy?
- With such a small box,

57
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,260
this is really heavy.

58
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,910
Is this filled with  gold and silver?

59
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,850
Not only that. There are a
lot of precious gems too.

60
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,130
Outside, there are carts
and carts of fabrics.

61
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,610
We have to transport each one of them
to the stockroom of the inner house.

62
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,710
I will surely be busy this whole day.

63
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,520
With so many good objects,
where did they come from?

64
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,190
Is it Big Madam's dowry?

65
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,060
- Still not done moving them?
- You must be joking.

66
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,190
How is that possible? These are all
gifts given by other people to General.

67
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,040
Not only these, there are still a lot
of outside falling in line and waiting.

68
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,110
They've been placed in a corner.
So many things waiting for us.

69
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,940
Big Madam just accepted all of them?

70
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,330
Maybe so. With so many good items being
delivered right in front of her,

71
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,720
will she still refuse them? Is she dumb?

72
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,550
Sister, hurry up!

73
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,420
Coming! Coming!

74
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,000
Have you settled down the people
sent by the marquis manor?

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,300
More or less. I've given
them unimportant tasks.

76
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,720
For the important areas, I've
placed people that I can trust.

77
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,100
Later, I'll tell Eldest Sister
to find me some new ones.

78
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,690
New servants have no foundation.

79
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,830
They will naturally follow my every order.

80
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,410
They won't work for the marquis manor.

81
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,460
Based on my temper, I'll just drive
them all back to the marquis manor.

82
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,710
Just blame it on me that I
hate all those old servants.

83
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,830
My husband, you're just temporarily dealing
with the problem to avert a crisis,

84
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,380
and not completely solving it.

85
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,540
To send them back to the marquis manor

86
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,220
without allowing your aunties and
stepmother to say any criticisms,

87
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,920
you can't use force.

88
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,074
Some people in the imperial
court might report

89
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:36,930
you as not cultivating
private morality,

90
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,480
and being disrespectful to your elders.

91
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,320
Aren't you satisfied yet with how
you got taken advantage of before?

92
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,040
My wife...

93
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,797
You've become a military
adviser that schemes

94
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:48,270
while inside the
comfort of your tent.

95
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,310
Stop being talkative.

96
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,840
Okay.

97
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,170
It's okay now.

98
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,100
Okay already. Quickly go.

99
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,910
Take this!

100
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,170
Do you still need me to guard you?

101
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,690
No need. Quickly go.

102
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,680
I'm going.

103
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,200
A palanquin from the marquis manor?

104
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,380
Big Madam Qin has come?

105
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,320
She most likely is bearing evil intentions.

106
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,110
You few, come over here.

107
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,350
Go to the drill area and
inform generals Geng and Duan

108
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,750
that I have some matters in my house and
will be delayed. I'll arrive an hour later.

109
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,500
Yes!

110
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,273
Young Master.

111
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:02,850
Later, I'll be waiting in
the outer courtyard study.

112
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,290
Don't be loud about it and just
guard in the inner courtyard.

113
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,391
Once Big Madam is unable
to handle it, immediately

114
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:09,350
tell me and I'll help her
out of the situation.

115
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,640
Okay, Young Master. Let's go.

116
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,928
Greetings, Mother-in-law.
I should be the one

117
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,800
going to the marquis
manor to greet you.

118
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,930
I was too busy moving and
cleaning up these past days.

119
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,220
Mother-in-law, hope you won't mind.

120
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,360
I know that you were busy moving, so
I didn't come for the past few days.

121
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,320
Are the young and old servants
that I've sent you useful?

122
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,990
You are considerate of me, so of course,
you'll choose the most able people.

123
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,850
I thank you for it.

124
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,580
If they are honest and capable,

125
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,960
how come you're still not giving
tasks to Nanny Lai and Nanny Diao?

126
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,730
Could it be because they are old,

127
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,290
so you think they aren't
nimble in doing their tasks?

128
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,260
No such thing.

129
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,700
Nanny Diao has a sickly body. I was
afraid that she'll tire herself out.

130
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,740
Nanny Lai is a well-experienced servant.

131
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,130
I'm thinking that I should give her an
important and honorable job, right?

132
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,450
So I kept weighing things
and still unable to decide.

133
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,890
Since you seem to know
what to do, I'm at ease.

134
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,630
Or else, if other find out, they
might think that I'm a miser.

135
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,090
That what I gave you are old,
weak, and disabled servants.

136
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,030
Mother-in-law, you've always
had a virtuous reputation.

137
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,980
Who in Bianjing City doesn't know that
you have a Bodhisattva-like heart?

138
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,070
Even if anyone will say such
words, no one will believe them.

139
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,590
The reputation of a widow
isn't really that important.

140
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,580
What's important is the
reputation of our Gu Family.

141
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,550
If you lack anything, just
send people to get it from me.

142
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,630
Why must you privately accept gifts
and hide it from your husband?

143
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,890
What are you saying? No such things.

144
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,740
You still want to hide
it from me, is that it?

145
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,230
Since Ye got promoted, people
didn't stop from sending him gifts.

146
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,150
You didn't inquire about them
and just accepted them all.

147
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,720
If His Majesty asks about this,

148
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,900
won't it be your husband and our
Gu Family bearing the brunt?

149
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,970
Although the imposing bearing
of our marquis manor

150
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,670
isn't as great as before,

151
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,220
our reputation has always been clean.

152
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,440
Must it get destroyed

153
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,760
in your hands?

154
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,110
I...really didn't accept any gifts.

155
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,160
General said that the current imperial
court situation isn't that stable.

156
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,790
If I don't accept all of them,
that's being enemies with everyone.

157
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,820
If I nitpick and accept only a few,
that's forming alliances or parties.

158
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,470
It's better to just accept them all,

159
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,890
but not open them. He'll just
inform His Majesty about it.

160
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,310
The items would be placed in the
stock room of the courtyard

161
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,610
and submitted to His Majesty as it is.

162
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,000
This Ye has really grown up.

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,640
He actually is this scheming and shrewd.

164
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,220
If I didn't know, I would have thought that

165
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,740
he was just pretending in the past.

166
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,570
Mother-in-law, you mustn't praise him.

167
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,720
If he's really shrewd, he wouldn't have
wandered outside for so many years,

168
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,642
unable to pass the civil examination.
He had to rely on

169
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:40,430
himself to achieve merit
through his sword and spear.

170
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,950
It's really hard for my husband
to achieve what he has now.

171
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,270
Although as his wife,
I'm indeed a bit dumb,

172
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,849
I do understand the principle of
husband and wife being united,

173
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:52,210
of sharing blessings and going
through hardships together.

174
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,530
I just say a statement,

175
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,120
and you have ten waiting for me.

176
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,190
Young Master!

177
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,360
- How are things?
- Don't worry. She has left.

178
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,290
- She has left?
- She has left.

179
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,450
- She didn't cause any trouble?
- She didn't.

180
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,360
It's very quiet in the inner courtyard. I
especially hid behind a tree to watch them.

181
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,425
That lady from the marquis
manor has a face that was this

182
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:23,300
long when she left. It's
almost touching the ground.

183
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,750
My stepmother has finally met her match.

184
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,695
My previous act of directly
punching my fist on them

185
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:31,700
is really not as good as
employing a soft nail tactic.

186
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,990
- Let's go to the drill field.
- Let's go.

187
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,850
What are you laughing about?

188
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,460
Young Master, your face earlier

189
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,810
really looked like a hen
protecting her chicks.

190
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,620
Get lost!

191
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,580
Don't let me use a small cup.
Quickly change it to a huge bowl.

192
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,880
Miss, Big Madam, that is too inappropriate.

193
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,160
I'll just pour you more.

194
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,130
What's wrong with Big Madam?

195
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,880
That old...thing, Nanny Lai,

196
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,431
kept leisurely touring our
manor and asking people

197
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:20,160
around, and then she'll report
it to the marquis manor.

198
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,690
Or else, how could she have come this fast?

199
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,560
What can we do?

200
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,790
I can't really tie her up, right? Moreover,

201
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,050
without her, there are still other
young and old maidservants.

202
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,630
All those sent by the marquis
manor are their spies.

203
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,930
I can't really kick all of them out, right?

204
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,069
That Nanny Lai even likes to pretend
to be a good person. Always

205
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:48,100
dragging a group of old maidservants
for drinks and gambling.

206
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,800
In just a few days, they are
already so close with each other.

207
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,670
Everyone is saying that she's very
generous and straightforward.

208
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,210
They all they her everything.

209
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,260
She has worked in the
marquis manor for decades.

210
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,460
For her to be like that

211
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,360
means she does have skills.

212
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,849
My mother-in-law of mine
is also not stupid.

213
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,140
How could she send
over a useless person?

214
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,123
Since she's here, then
she's a thorny porcupine.

215
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:13,580
You can't hit, scold,
or drive her away.

216
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,077
Never thought that despite
moving out of the

217
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:16,530
marquis manor, it will
still be this stuff.

218
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,490
So annoying.

219
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,350
Xiaotao is getting agitated.

220
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,480
Be careful of choking. Big Madam,
there are still a lot of pear soup.

221
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,608
Oh, right. There's still
a pile of books over

222
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,900
there. Big Madam, please
take a look at them too.

223
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,970
Cuiwei,

224
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,360
I really feel that it's better to
just be a miss at Shouan Hall.

225
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,800
My good Miss, good Big Madam,

226
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,190
you now holds great power. The
whole Bianjing are envious of you.

227
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,330
Let's go. Let's go. Quickly go read them.

228
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,710
This manor is so huge.

229
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,340
Just the garden, you won't be
able to completely stroll it

230
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,180
in half a day. Asking just
a few of us to clean it,

231
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,850
is really asking for our life.

232
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,200
Big Madam said

233
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,860
that she's going to pick some reliable
ones. But it's already been half a day

234
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,870
and there are still no one coming.

235
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,720
Could it be that the manor has
not enough money for expenses,

236
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,430
hence, she couldn't buy
any servant anymore?

237
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,700
She can only talk.

238
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,280
Say, among the people here in this manor,

239
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,250
who doesn't have siblings
or nephews and nieces

240
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,780
at home?

241
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,800
Call all those who are not doing anything

242
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,850
to come here for work.

243
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,130
Pick some smart and nimble ones to hire.

244
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,260
Won't that be more reliable than

245
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,040
- those bought from outside? Am I right?
- Right...

246
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,310
It's really better to work
in the marquis manor.

247
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,390
Big Madam is a goddess, a Bodhisattva.

248
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,260
She also doesn't have so many weird rules.

249
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,210
Those that work in the garden are not
allowed to enter the front courtyard,

250
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,940
not allowed to casually move around.

251
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,500
Prisoners sentenced to die might be
having a more relaxed life than us.

252
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,060
You better lower down your voice.

253
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,100
That Big Madam of ours
can really hold grudges.

254
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,120
I just refuted her a few times
when we met her a few days ago.

255
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,090
She immediately punished my daughter.

256
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,134
She had all those first
level female servants

257
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:21,670
attending to Young
Master plant trees.

258
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,060
Not placing any people in
the room of the Master

259
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,320
isn't the doing of a wife of
a great aristocratic family.

260
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,600
She probably is afraid that if Master
sees how beautiful your daughter is,

261
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,651
he might realize how she pales
in comparison to your daughter.

262
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:33,350
Indeed.

263
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,850
I can't be sure about that.

264
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,620
But, at the bottom of it all,

265
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,000
she did come from a family of officials.

266
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,130
Although she's an illegitimate daughter,

267
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,760
she shouldn't be this jealous, right?

268
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,190
What are you all saying?!

269
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,674
Are you people even worthy
to be seen by our Master?

270
00:17:59,686 --> 00:18:01,730
Are you even worthy to
gossip about Big Madam?

271
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,306
Dirty shrews. If you get put
together, expelled out, and threw

272
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:06,700
in the snow, even beggars won't
take a second look at you.

273
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,680
What did I say? Miss Xiaotao,

274
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,460
don't you falsely accuse me.

275
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,930
So, you're the master of this house now?
You can just hire anyone that you like

276
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,995
or let anyone you want to
serve in front of the Master?

277
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:20,010
If you're that capable, why
still order your daughter?

278
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,970
Why don't you go out, walk around, and in
passing, find yourself a man to marry?

279
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,820
Say, miss, why are you so
rude and unreasonable?

280
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,020
At the very least, I'm old
enough to be your ancestor.

281
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,640
I just made a few jokes

282
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,950
while tending the ground.

283
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,520
How did that offend you?

284
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,100
Exactly. Miss, you might
have heard it wrong.

285
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,920
We didn't say anything.

286
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,260
Don't use this trick to fool me.

287
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,640
If I hear it again, I don't
need to inform Big Madam

288
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,120
and will just get a pole
to drive you all out.

289
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,570
She wouldn't be going to Big
Madam and tell on us, right?

290
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,480
So what? Can that Big Madam

291
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,740
hit us with thorny planks?

292
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,710
Won't she has become being harsh on old
servants and disrespectful to her elders?

293
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,750
As a servant, we shouldn't lower ourselves

294
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,810
and just let our master deal with us
in whatever way she wants, right?

295
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,520
Won't we have become
like pigs or dogs then?

296
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,324
If we don't want to get
bullied, we must stick together

297
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:25,850
and be like a rope, stay
united and work together.

298
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,410
Only then can we make a
footing in this manor.

299
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,280
That's right. From now on,
we'll listen to you then.

300
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,120
We'll listen to you from now on.

301
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,398
Yesterday, it was the
birthday of Duke Ying of the

302
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,840
State. Rulan and I accompanied
mother to greet him.

303
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,350
You were the most talked about topic there.

304
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,098
They say that you don't
give any importance to your

305
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,400
elders and is unfilial to
your legitimate mother.

306
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,659
Big Madam Qin has a hard
life for being a widow,

307
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:57,710
yet was able to maintain
such a good temper.

308
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,760
They said that you were late in greeting
them on the first day after your wedding.

309
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,783
That there is clearly a
legitimate mother yet, but

310
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:05,670
you have to move out and
set up your own manor.

311
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,060
They are all saying that you're heartless.

312
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,350
What else?

313
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,490
There's still a lot. They even said that
you two are being harsh on your servants.

314
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,460
Just willfully hitting and
scolding old servants.

315
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,490
Not putting any importance on the people
that your elders have arranged for you.

316
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,760
That is equivalent to being
supercilious and unfilil to elders.

317
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,590
There are still a lot of bad ones.
I don't want to say them anymore.

318
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,352
When mother and Rulan heard
them, they were really

319
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:31,860
mad, but they couldn't
really openly argue.

320
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,620
They were so angry that
they left without eating.

321
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,670
It's all my fault?

322
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,930
Doesn't that Big Madam Qin
not have any fault at all?

323
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,910
Of course!

324
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,290
How come everything you said were about me?

325
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,470
Is my husband a perfect person?

326
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,510
Must you two get criticized together

327
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,300
before you will stop?

328
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,130
It's all him who dragged me
into this muddled water.

329
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,690
It shouldn't only be me who
gets talked on, right?

330
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,530
The criticisms about your husband
are still those same words.

331
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,690
Things like being disobedient since he
was a child, a frequenter of brothels,

332
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,400
the god of death in front
of a mountain of corpses.

333
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,140
Those are nothing. Aren't
there anything else?

334
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,780
This Yunhui General of yours saved the
past emperor and the current emperor.

335
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,443
Two imperial decrees have
said that he is loyal

336
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:21,920
to the emperor, considerate
to the empire,

337
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,610
virtuous, filial, lofty, and unsullied.
Who still dares to say more?

338
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,930
He indeed got himself a protective armor.

339
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,284
This is already great for him.
Or else, don't

340
00:21:31,296 --> 00:21:33,560
know what else those
people could have said.

341
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,250
I was never invited in those banquets.

342
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,690
I've never been this coldly treated even
when I was just a Miss in our house.

343
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:48,420
The ways of your mother-in-law is
way better than those in our house.

344
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,850
No wonder grandmother initially
wouldn't agree to marry you to here.

345
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,300
It was clearly her who spread the news.

346
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,040
She then had to put out
a being bullied facade.

347
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,690
My husband and I can't really go explain
that to each and every person, right?

348
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,690
Even if we do, no one will believe us.

349
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:07,260
Sixth, this can't do.

350
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,720
Since I've walked this path,

351
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,560
there's no use no matter how I hated it.
I can't really stop walking it, right?

352
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,170
Even if I don't want to walk, someone
would be pushing me to walk.

353
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,230
Since that's the case, why
not just walk smilingly?

354
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,820
Either way, I'll be walking it forever.

355
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,960
The task of purchasing for the kitchen
is not a job that one can be sloppy at.

356
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,470
Nanny Lai, you are a
well-experienced servant.

357
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,780
You also are doing this
back in the marquis manor.

358
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,860
I'll entrust you this task then.

359
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,250
I surely will do my best!

360
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,920
Nanny Diao, you are sickly, so I
won't give you any more task.

361
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,022
Nanny Hua and Nanny Tian used
to be in-charge of clothes

362
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:04,260
washing and cleaning of the manor
back in the marquis manor.

363
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,459
We'll do the same here. Since
you are well-experienced

364
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:08,400
in these tasks, I'm at
ease to hand them to you.

365
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,630
Yes. Yes.

366
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,690
I've already written what job
everyone else will be having.

367
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,100
Cuiwei will be reading them to you later.

368
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,260
And then, everyone, just
follow the task you were given

369
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,430
to get your badge and keys.

370
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,460
I'm young, so my arrangements
may not be that adequate.

371
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,140
Let's just test it for a year.

372
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,537
If you really can't do
it or if there are any

373
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:32,800
improper assignments,
just go exchange work

374
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,580
or come tell me about it.

375
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,170
Yes.

376
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,530
I've woken early today
and feel a bit tired.

377
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,220
I'll go back and rest now.

378
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,200
You all just go busy with your work.

379
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,110
Okay. Okay.

380
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,900
Let's go. Go.

381
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,300
See that? She's still indeed young.

382
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,000
After being imposing for three days,
she still couldn't continue with it.

383
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,840
So ingenuous.

384
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,200
She only know to eat and sleep.

385
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Easy to deal with.

386
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,400
Aren't you quite happy?

387
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,200
Go. Go. Let's go get our keys.

388
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,100
Go now.

389
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,400
[ Jiaxi Lodge ]

390
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,400
This rain is falling as
if the sky is falling.

391
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Good thing you instructed people to
take the clothes inside this afternoon.

392
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
You indeed can predict things well.

393
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,300
I feel that what you said is very right.

394
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,700
Wrong. You should say that
I've lectured you well.

395
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,200
It's all thanks to Big Madam
for teaching me well.

396
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
It's all because you have
incredible foresight.

397
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,200
Correct.

398
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,800
I feel that what you said is very right.

399
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,200
Did you predict then that your husband
will get drenched in the rain?

400
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,200
Quickly enter the room.

401
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,760
I've predicted that it would rain

402
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,600
and instructed someone to deliver
you an umbrella. How come...

403
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,500
I rode a horse to attend the
imperial court meeting.

404
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,500
It would be better if you have
just given me a veiled hat.

405
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,000
Why don't you...just ride a carriage

406
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,400
to the palace next time?

407
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,200
Next time, I'll ride a
carriage to fetch you.

408
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,300
I surely won't let you get wet.

409
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,200
Am I angry about that?!

410
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,100
What then?

411
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,400
Forget it.

412
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,000
I'll just patiently wait.

413
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,400
Wait for what?

414
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,700
Wait until you know how to treat
your husband during a rainy day.

415
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,800
A horse carriage still won't do?

416
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,600
Is it because you recently heard
the public discussions about us

417
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,100
that's why, you're a bit upset?

418
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,400
During the birthday of the wife
of Duke Ying of the State,

419
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,700
she invited all illustrious
families in the capital, except us.

420
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,200
She not only didn't invite us,

421
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,000
other than his son-in-law State Uncle Shen,

422
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,500
Little Duan, Old Geng, and all the
others from Yuzhou were not invited too.

423
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,200
You're just going to watch?

424
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,000
He's an old official that
has served three emperors.

425
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,323
Duke Ying of the state and his wife have
very strong personalities, are very

426
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:26,700
strict in managing their household, and
give too much importance to etiquette.

427
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,400
I had a very bad reputation before,

428
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,200
and is now just a newly favored officer.

429
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,500
An old man like that will never
give men any importance.

430
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,181
I'm just afraid that three
people can turn a gossip into a

431
00:27:38,193 --> 00:27:39,800
tiger. That the more people
doing it can destroy a bone.

432
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,600
No matter how heroic and valiant you are,

433
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,800
if the whole world say
that you are a scoundrel,

434
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,500
as days go by, the whole world
will start to believe it.

435
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,700
Didn't you exactly suffer
because of such trick before?

436
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm a scoundrel.

437
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,700
Wife is seeking justice for me?

438
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,757
As a married couple, we are of one body.
Either one

439
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:03,600
getting glory or destruction
will affect both.

440
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,420
Of course, I must think for your sake.

441
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
No need.

442
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,200
I've survived a mountain of
blades and a sea of fire.

443
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,600
Would I still mind these these things?

444
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,640
Are you mad again?

445
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,420
Anyway, you can't run away.

446
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,400
The days are long.

447
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,000
It's broad daylight!

448
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,200
Let's eat together later for dinner.

449
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,900
Dinner later!

450
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,600
He's such a ruffian.

451
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
So moody.

452
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,700
One moment, so happy.

453
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,100
One moment, getting mad
for no reason at all.

454
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,000
Even Buddha isn't this hard to attend to.

455
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,000
Have you ironed the clothes?

456
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,100
Who do you think you are?!

457
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,400
I've eaten more salt than
the rice you've eaten!

458
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,600
Is it your turn to meddle in this matter?

459
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,000
You are using your age to take advantage of
us, assigning good tasks to your relatives

460
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,600
and earning kickbacks from it.

461
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,600
And you won't even let people talk? Don't
think that we don't know about it!

462
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,000
Since that's the case, go report me then.

463
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Go! The courtyard of Big Madam is just that
way, as if you don't know the direction.

464
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Go and report on me! Go!

465
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,400
Isn't it because you know that
Big Madam has a good temper,

466
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,000
- So what?
- and that you're from the marquis manor,

467
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,800
so no one can touch you, right? But
don't bully people so intolerably!

468
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,400
These two maidservants are
young and inexperienced.

469
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,800
When things have gone missing,
you just blame it on them.

470
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,600
You're already this old, yet
you still bully a child!

471
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,700
Do you have an conscience?!

472
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,600
These two little kids

473
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,800
clearly have dirty hands.

474
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
You are still defending them?

475
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,420
You must be their accomplice.

476
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,300
If I've taken any money
improperly from this manor,

477
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,200
I would then have a tragic death.

478
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,400
There's no use for you to make oaths here.

479
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,000
Let me tell you that the kitchen
purchasing is under my jurisdiction.

480
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,400
I'm also in-charge of the items there.

481
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,900
I can investigate whoever I want.
It's none of your business.

482
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,400
- You...
- What?

483
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,800
You stinky woman!

484
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,600
- You bitch! You say is to beautifully!
- What?!

485
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,400
Each of you are...

486
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,700
That Nanny Lai was still pretentious
before in being so just.

487
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,930
Seeing how everyone can't dare
turn hostile against her,

488
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,200
she started to be imposing.

489
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,000
My guess was right.

490
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,600
No matter how sly a fox is, it will
show its tail sooner or later.

491
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,000
The one fighting with her earlier
is the wife of Wang Wu, right?

492
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,200
In the whole Cheng Garden now, only she

493
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,800
can dare to argue with Nanny Lai.

494
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,600
She's also a very straightforward person.

495
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,400
Big Madam, you have to intervene.

496
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
If you still don't, that
straightforward person

497
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,400
will soon get pushed aside
to having no way out.

498
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm intervening, but the
right time hasn't come yet.

499
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,400
After lunch, tell that Wang Wu...

500
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,000
- Tell that Wang Wu's wife to come to me.
- Yes.

501
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,320
[ Jiaxi Lodge ]

502
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,000
What task do you do?

503
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,200
Replying to Big Madam, just some manual
labor. Once I'm not doing anything anymore,

504
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,200
I'll go help the gardeners water
the flowers and plow the soil.

505
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,800
I can see the plants in the
garden growing quite well.

506
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,400
It was also very clean.
You are really capable.

507
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,496
I'm a crude person and is
very straightforward. I

508
00:31:55,508 --> 00:31:57,700
only know to do tasks that
requires manual strength.

509
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,800
I dare not be described as being capable.

510
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,600
The eastern side of the garden is quite
barren, hence, not pleasing to the eyes.

511
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,200
I feel that we are lacking
people who can plant.

512
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,000
I can see that you are knowledgeable
in this and is quite an honest person.

513
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'll leave this matter to you then.

514
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,200
Big Madam, are you serious?

515
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,800
Of course, I am.

516
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,400
What? You're not willing?

517
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,800
No. No.

518
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,200
It's just that planting will
require a lot of expenses.

519
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,480
I...only know to do the manual labor

520
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,400
and has never did such an important task.

521
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,000
I..fear that I might not do it well.

522
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,100
You haven't done it, so how do you
know that you can't do it well?

523
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,400
I fear that I don't know the market.

524
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,900
If I buy too expensive ones,
that's additional expenses.

525
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,200
If I buy poor quality ones, I will
cause our manor to lose face.

526
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,838
As long as you set your
thoughts in an upright manner,

527
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,500
it's fine even if you aren't
able to do this task well.

528
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,400
Whoever dares to criticize you
and not listen to your orders

529
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,000
will not be lightly spared by me.

530
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,880
Since Big Madam is willing to trust me,

531
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,800
I'll surely give it my best

532
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,900
to fulfill this task beautifully!

533
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,500
As long as you remember two things. First,

534
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,600
do this task well and don't
let anyone find any flaws.

535
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,300
Second, Nanny Lai is a well-experienced
servant of the marquis manor.

536
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,000
She has such good temper
and is very amicable.

537
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You must respect her.

538
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,800
Of course, Nanny Lai must be respected.

539
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,000
I understand. I understand everything.

540
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,200
Okay. You go now.

541
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,600
Yes.

542
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,000
Miss, did you deliberately let
everyone outside hear that?

543
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,600
This early morning, that Wang Wu's
wife and Nanny Lai had a fight.

544
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,000
This afternoon, I immediately
granted her a fat task.

545
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,600
Everyone can surely guess where
the wind is blowing, right?

546
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,200
Hope she did understand what you mean.

547
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,800
Big Madam, father said

548
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,800
that it's fine if you can't write well.
You just need to practice more.

549
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Who said that my words are bad?

550
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,000
I just wrote the wrong stroke earlier.

551
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Your stroke isn't wrong. I saw it.

552
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,000
Good child, let's just
continue writing tomorrow.

553
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,800
Let's just read some books for a while.

554
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,200
This...I've already
finished reading that book.

555
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,500
I can recite all of it.

556
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,400
You...at such a young age,

557
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,800
how come you know so many words?
You also know to read poems?

558
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,200
When I used to live on the boat,

559
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,400
my father would have me
memorize a poem every day.

560
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,600
Later on, I went to Second
Aunt-in-law's home academy too.

561
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,500
Who is Second Aunt-in-law?

562
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,800
Sheng House's second aunt-in-law. Aunt Hai.

563
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,400
You don't even know that?

564
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,600
My brother and sister-in-law
left me with no gap.

565
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,500
They've taught you everything and
I've got nothing left to teach you.

566
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,400
Big Madam, I want to play polo.

567
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,800
I can teach you that!

568
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,800
But, but not yet since
you're still too young.

569
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,000
You can't ride the horse.

570
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,200
Let's wait a couple more years
and I'll surely to teach you.

571
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,000
We can learn to fish first.

572
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,600
We can still ride a small horse first.

573
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,200
Look at your look!

574
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,400
Looks like you've made
up your mind already.

575
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,000
Fine. I'll have your father
buy you a small horse then.

576
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,200
We learn to fish first though.
You can learn that, right?

577
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,000
Yes, I will hook a carp
and make chopped fish.

578
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,700
- Take it slow, Nanny Chang.
- Big Madam.

579
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,600
Big Madam.

580
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,700
The miss and you are so fated.

581
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,200
Our Miss Rong still lacks
skills about lady's crafts.

582
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,000
We have to coax her three
days to embroider once.

583
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,800
She holds a needle and says she's
sleepy just at one incense burn.

584
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,200
She's not as steady as Miss Xian next door.

585
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,000
It's alright.

586
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,600
When she's older, she'll be more steady.

587
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,400
When I was little, I was
much more playful than her.

588
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Just that my house wasn't too peaceful,

589
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,600
so I forced myself to be more rule-bound.
But look how great now.

590
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,100
This whole room is full of our own
and she can fuss if she wants.

591
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,600
She keeps playing with Sister Xian
and she'll pick up naturally.

592
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,000
My sister-in-law Shao next
door is so amiable too.

593
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,000
Our grown up matters
aren't the kids' issues.

594
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,000
Actually, Miss Rong is lucky.

595
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,800
My young master is always
worried about Chang.

596
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Big Madam, may you not be offended.
That's his only heartache.

597
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,200
Why would I find offense?

598
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,100
This is how a father should behave.

599
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,800
If I could have had a father
like him when I was young,

600
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,500
many sufferings would have been spared.

601
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,400
You are so understanding, Big Madam.

602
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,200
My young master is so lucky
that he married you.

603
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,000
I also hope everyday that
he can find Chang sooner.

604
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,600
And our courtyard will be
that much more bustling.

605
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,900
Who said I stole? 

606
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,000
I thought these were just useless branches.

607
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,200
So I was cleaning them up
to throw them away outside.

608
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,000
You are always bluffing about how you're
a seasoned elder from the marquis manor.

609
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,200
That you've managed everything
before and you know it all.

610
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,200
But you can't even recognize tree roots?

611
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,200
You are seriously! You're trying
to fool us as if we're idiots?

612
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,400
This is a noble specie
transported in from Jiangnan.

613
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Each stem costs a strand of money.

614
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,700
You're trying to take
it to sell it outside!

615
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,900
Which one of your eyes saw me steal?

616
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,500
Let me tell you. Even if you report to
the big madam, I won't acknowledge it.

617
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,400
You think you are worth
something before Big Madam?

618
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,100
She's a lady of a noble house and
she doesn't stoop to your level.

619
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:05,100
But you turn around and
think you're so mighty!

620
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,600
Mother Lai, there's God three
inches on top of your head.

621
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,900
Stop committing so many evil
deeds or karma will hit you.

622
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,860
You! You!

623
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Stop hitting.
- Don't stop me.

624
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,400
I must teach this whore.

625
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,700
Stop pulling me.
- You'll all get reprimanded.

626
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,700
What are you!

627
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm at least from the marquis house.

628
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,600
You? What can you all do to me?

629
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,000
You're from the marquis house.

630
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,200
And you instigated your second
daughter to go and seduce our lord.

631
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,000
Who can't see that through?
If our lady finds out,

632
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,300
you'll be the first to sent out.

633
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,600
I'll kill you.

634
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
We're onto you.

635
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,000
You still think you're so mighty?

636
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,400
Stop pulling me.

637
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,200
Forget it.

638
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,200
They're fighting! They're fighting!

639
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,200
Then you don't go out
so you don't get hurt.

640
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,000
I won't. They won't dare to hurt me.

641
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,600
That.

642
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,000
That child. She's like her father.
Just as bold.

643
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,490
Forgive me, Big Madam.

644
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:18,000
It's not that I want to be meddlesome.

645
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,600
But nowadays, in this marquis manor,

646
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,000
it's always someone fighting here or there.

647
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,400
It's ridiculously chaotic.

648
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,790
Allow me to speak an usurping word.

649
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,200
Back then, in the inner courtyard
of the Bai House in Yangzhou,

650
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,200
even they were more
rule-bound then this lot.

651
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,600
The Bai House lord must
have set a strict code.

652
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,000
Of course.

653
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,800
Such a large manor can't be without rules.

654
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,200
Back then when Ye's maternal
grandmother was alive,

655
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,500
the servants didn't even dare
to talk in a loud voice.

656
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,790
Later, unfortunately she passed away,

657
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:57,200
and my miss took over things.

658
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,650
She set up iron rules herself.

659
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,600
If someone commits a grave wrong,

660
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,500
they are severely punished
without ever any mercy.

661
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,200
It's true.

662
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,000
In order to punish those petty
troublemakers severely,

663
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,500
I must wait till they
commit a grave wrong first.

664
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,600
Big Madam, I don't understand.

665
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
If it's our own servants,

666
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,600
we can handle however
we want if they error.

667
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,000
But these are all sent over by the
elders from the marquis manor.

668
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,800
Small and big fights.

669
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,200
A couple rebukes today and
two slashes tomorrow.

670
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,180
Each and every, and they'll
know it's not such a big deal.

671
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,600
Now, Mother Lei isn't winning
any trusts from anyone.

672
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,200
But without Mother Lei, we still
have Mother Hua and Mother Tian.

673
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,310
When will it all end?

674
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,600
It's better to hit them dead with one
cane for them to never resurrect again.

675
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,000
Big Madam. If there's anything,

676
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I  can perhaps help with . . .

677
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,900
There is a matter that I
really do need your help with.

678
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,700
Great.

679
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,500
I hear that illegitimate
daughter of Sheng House,

680
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,500
as soon as she married over, she
drove Gu Second to move out.

681
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,400
She even scolds an elderly nanny
who's been there over a decade.

682
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,000
That Gu Second is a rogue as well.

683
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,110
He's always running around outside.

684
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,100
Fetching all sorts of
novelties for her to eat.

685
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,900
A great general and being
dispatched like a junior servant.

686
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,600
No propriety whatsoever.

687
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,700
Old Marquis's corpse is still not cold yet.

688
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,600
And that Gu Second already left
the capital to pursue freedom.

689
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,600
I don't know what luck he's got though.

690
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,400
Somehow he's baked himself
into a new noble.

691
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,800
He's made it and turns around
to give the cold shoulder.

692
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,600
And mock the Gu elders like this.

693
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,200
I think he and that one from Sheng House

694
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,600
are perfect match.

695
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,000
I don't know what curse Yuanruo was under.

696
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,200
To be smitten by her kind.

697
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,000
Thanks to Heaven's providence
that she didn't marry here.

698
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,600
Or else, our Qi House.

699
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,600
Who knows what plight we'd be under now.

700
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,400
How are you up?

701
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,400
You've been ill for so long
and you're just recovering.

702
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,200
Don't get chill again.

703
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,600
Sixth Sister only loves to eat a bit.

704
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,200
I imagine Gu Second doting
on her isn't a major issue.

705
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,600
What's there to speak of?

706
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,800
Her temperament is most
prudent and diligent.

707
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,200
She's not someone to ever go
wild over gaining of power.

708
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,200
People are just too talkative
and I imagine it's false.

709
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,000
We don't mention her then.

710
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,800
I came to report to Father and Mother.

711
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,000
My body is fine now.

712
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I was ill before and it
delayed my reporting to duty.

713
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,500
Starting tomorrow, I will head on over.

714
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,800
I'm glad you've thought it through.

715
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,700
We all need to look to ahead to live life.

716
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,700
Yuanruo, Yuanruo, about the,
if you want to again . . .

717
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,200
Don't mention it again.

718
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,300
Then we never mention it?

719
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,700
We'll mention it in a couple of years.

720
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,700
Father. Are you trying to find me a marriage?

721
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,300
Look at you, since you're not that young anymore.

722
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,000
And you've passed the exam 
and that Shen House . . .

723
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,400
You're still young so we do not rush.

724
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,570
We'll talk in a couple of years.
Just focus on your official career.

725
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:54,400
If father and mother feel it is necessary,
please do it.
