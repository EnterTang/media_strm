我不知道 我是说 有DNA证据
I don't know. I mean, it's DNA.

- Sure, but... - And I know my Dad really loves Karen.

00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,922
他一直很爱她 是他们的婚外情导致我父母离婚的
He always has. Their affair is what broke up my parents' marriage.

That's what I thought. You don't know him. You just met him.

34
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:29,399
好吧 你说得对 我 我或许不了解你爸
Okay, you're right, I... I may not know your dad,

35
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,002
但我非常肯定他没有杀Vikram

- 是的 - 喔 喔 喔 等等 等等
- Yes. - Whoa whoa whoa. Hold on, hold on.

40
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:47,500
抱歉 Taylor先生 但我必须要提醒你 你回答的这些
I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor, but I have to remind you that you're answering these

41
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:49,686

43
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:57,226
很好 那这个呢? 你是不是对Vikram的车做了手脚?
Good. How about this? Did you tamper with Vikram's car?

44
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,828
什么? 没有
What? No.

45
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:02,131
是你杀了他吗? 并假造了车祸现场?
Did you kill him? Make it look like an accident?

46
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:04,233
太荒谬了 下一个问题
That's absurd. Next question.

47
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:06,535
你做过Vikram的车吗?
Have you ever been inside Vikram's car?

48
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:07,870
很多年前 我是他的手下
I worked for him... Years ago.

49
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:11,006
但他死时开的那车 没有 从没坐过
But the car that he was driving when he died? No, never.

50
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:14,347
那为什么到处都是你的DNA呢?
Then why is your DNA all over it?

51
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:19,581
- 这不可能 这... - 这不仅可能 这是事实
- That's impossible. It... - It's not only possible, it's true.

- So you think... - I think you killed him,

为了他的钱 为了能和他的妻子在一起

- What do you think? - I think I'm gonna stop talking now.

55
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,767
Whitney 天呐
Whitney, my god.

56
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:43,638
听着 他们说你爸爸的事 都不是真的
Listen, what they're saying about your father, it's not true.

57
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,074
- 那不可能 - 是啊 我老听人这么说

- Uh, I want to see Jack. - Sorry, the chief's in with him now.

59
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:56,017
当他结束审问后 他想跟你聊聊
And when he's done, he wants to talk to you.

60
00:02:56,117 --> 00:02:59,853
Danny 你先把Lacey和Whitney送回家 好吗?

00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:05,004
- 我保证会没事的 - 不 我是说我不能丢下我爸爸
- I'll make sure it's okay. - No, I mean I'm not leaving my Dad.

63
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,080
宝贝 我经历过这些
Honey, I've been through this.

64
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:10,097
他们短期内不会让你见他的
They're not gonna let you see him anytime soon.

65
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:12,599
这是事实 现在除了去休息一会
It's true. There's nothing else you can do right now

66
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,536
其他的事你无能为力
except for try to get some rest.

67
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:16,937
是啊 想得真美
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

68
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:18,638
你知道吗 Whitney Danny说的对 我们或许该走了
You know, Whitney, Danny's right. We should probably go.

69
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,565
好吧 我不管了
Okay, whatever.

70
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:28,135

I'm telling you, we're gonna figure this out, okay?

71
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,119
是啊 这是最好了

I just gotta take a shower. Maybe I can borrow some sweats?

00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:10,955
- 当然 抱歉 - 不 请别说抱歉了
- Of course, I'm sorry. - No, please. "Sorry"?

80
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:15,227
Lacey 你真好 非常感谢你
Lacey, you're been... amazing. Thank you so much.

- Well, I don't know. Maybe I should have. - Lacey, no, look...

85
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,852
你得做些什么 你不能让的Whitney爸爸为你背黑锅
You need to do something. You can't let Whitney's dad take the blame for this.

86
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:44,021
我明白 好吗? 没人比我更清楚这感受
I know, okay? No one understands that better than I do.

我让我妈妈请了纽约最好的律师

This is so embarrassing.

92
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:20,523
不 没什么的

00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:17,245
Jack没事吧? 他承认任何事了吗?
Is Jack all right? Did he admit to anything?

108
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:18,713
你明白我不能跟你讨论这些的
You know I can't talk about that with you.

109
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,248
好吧 那 我先回家了

我知道你们俩有婚外情
I know you two were having an affair.

113
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:39,867
严格来说 那不是婚外情 我丈夫死了
Technically, it's not an affair. My husband's dead.

114
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:41,568
但这事是在他死前开始的 对吗?
But it started before he died, right?

115
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,972
多年前 Jack和我是在一起过
Jack and I were together years ago,

116

- 但结束了 - 为什么?
- but it ended. - Why?

117
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,942
因为他明白了你永远不会离开Vikram吗
'Cause he realized you were never gonna leave Vikram?

118
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:52,345
- 你在审讯我吗? - 只是问些问题
- Are you interrogating me? - Just asking some questions.

119
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,615

你告诉过Jack人身意外保险的事吗?
Did you ever tell Jack about that life insurance policy?

121

一千万美元?
$10 million?

122
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,308
说过 但是在他们找到Vikram尸体的那晚
Yes, but not until the night they found Vikram's body.

123
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:07,244
Jack整晚都和我在一起 所以...
And Jack was with me the whole night, so...

124
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,078
死亡时间大约是四十八小时前
The time of death was about 48 hours earlier.

那车在溪谷里有段时间了
The car had been in that gully for a while.

126
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:12,882
那地方还很偏僻
It's a pretty remote spot.

127
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:14,284
但Jack不知道钱的事
But Jack didn't know about the money then.

128
00:07:14,385 --> 00:07:16,586
他曾经为Vikram工作过 对吗?
He used to work for Vikram, right?

129
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,655
我是说 或许Vikram告诉过他保险的事
I mean, maybe Vikram told him about the policy

130
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:21,491
或者他自己发现了什么 你觉得呢?
or he found out some other way, don't you think?

131
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:26,829
我猜这 有可能把
I guess it's... possible.

132
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:31,234
你觉得Jack有能力杀人吗?
Do you think Jack is capable of murder?

133
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,775
Karen 你有任何Jack希望Vikram死的理由吗?
Karen, do you have any reason to believe that Jack wanted Vikram dead?

134
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:44,630
我觉得没有 但 我不知道
I didn't think so, but... I don't know.

135
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,765
我不知道
I just don't know.

136
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:56,591
这个律师怎么样? 因为我不会让
How good is this lawyer? 'cause I'm not letting

137
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:59,194
一个无辜的人因为我做的事而进监狱的
an innocent man go to jail for something that I did.

138
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:00,929
他也不是那么无辜
Well, he's not exactly innocent.

139
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,697
他是那个伪造车祸现场的人
He's the one who staged the accident.

140
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:08,436
- 为了我 为了我们 - 或许吧
- As a favor to me, to us. - Well, maybe.

141
00:08:08,537 --> 00:08:10,471
或许Jack在我提到人身意外保险之前
Maybe Jack knew about the life insurance policy

142
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:12,807
就知道这件事的
before I even mentioned it.

143
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:15,075
或许他希望他们找到你爸爸的尸体
Maybe he wanted them to find your dad's body

144
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:17,812
那我们就可以申请赔款了
so that we could claim the money.

145
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,380
等等 你在说什么啊?
Wait, what are you talking about?

146
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:22,047
- 你说过他是个好人 - 我知道
- You're the one who said he was this nice guy... - I know.

147
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:27,154
Vikram告诉过Tess他有生命危险
Vikram told Tess that his life was in danger,

148
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:28,989
在Jack去找他之后他就失踪了
and he disappeared after Jack went to see him.

149
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,319
- 他们打了一架 所以 - 所以什么 你觉得Jack
- They had a big fight, so... - So what, you think Jack

150
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:33,921
六个月前就试图杀了他吗?
tried to kill him six months ago?

151
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:35,196
我是说 那又怎么样呢?
I mean, what does that matter now?

152
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:38,899
我只是说或许Jack也不是什么圣人
I'm just saying maybe Jack isn't such a saint after all.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,902
不管他做了什么 不管他什么动机
Whatever he did, whatever his motives,

154
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:43,570
我是那个杀死我爸爸的人
I'm the one who killed my Dad.

155
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:47,012
而现在 这才是最重要的
And right now, that is all that matters.

156
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:56,015
天呐 你来这做什么?
Oh my god, what are you doing here?

157
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:57,551
我要跟Danny谈谈
I need to talk to Danny.

158
00:08:57,652 --> 00:08:59,720
- 好吧 但 - 没事的
- Fine, but... - It's okay.

159
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:02,284
交给我吧 谢谢
I got it. Thanks.

160
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:09,698
- 过来 - Danny. Danny
- Come on. - Danny. Danny.

161
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:14,023
听着 不管Jack会向我爸交代所有事 或
Look, either Jack's about to tell my Dad everything or...

162
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,860
不 如果他想说什么 他早就说了
No, if he was gonna say anything, he would've done it by now.

163
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:18,194
所以他为了你背黑锅?
So he's just gonna cover for you?

164
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:20,263
他会为了他没做过的事而进监狱吗
He's gonna go to prison for a murder he didn't commit?

165
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:21,430
你不能让他这么做 Danny
You can't let him do that, Danny.
