1
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,999
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,639
Thank you! Thank you, thank you,
thank you...

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,799
And thank YOU in particular, yes.

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,039
All right, we are back

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,079
and we have been busy driving
a whole lot of cars.

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,880
Here's what we've got coming up
for you in this series.

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,480
Who says we don't do
serious car reviews?

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,719
Here!

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,560
Noooo!

10
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,520
Whoohoo! How good is that?!

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,159
- Scare me! - Scare you?!

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,040
- Scare me! - I'm trying!

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,960
That's what I'm talking about!

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,879
Yahoo!

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,039
That, my friend, is panache.

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,959
Imola!

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
Incoming car.

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,840
Come on!

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,319
All that to look forward to
over the next six weeks, OK?

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,559
But first up,

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,719
you ask any car lover what their
favourite noise in the world is,

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,479
and they will immediately say...

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,879
The V8 engine.

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,079
Exactly.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,959
And with this year being,
as you all know,

26
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,039
the 116th anniversary
of the V8 car...

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,199
The big 116!

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,239
..we decided it was time
for a little celebration.

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,559
Yeah, so the producers told us three
each to pick a new V8 sports car

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,799
that could do anything.

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,960
And head to America's Wild West
for a mystery road trip.

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,719
The United States -

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,280
spiritual home of the V8 and land
of the great American road trip.

34
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,199
Ours would begin
at a remote location in Utah,

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,959
where we'd been told to show up
with the best all-around sports car

36
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,839
we could find, powered by that most
iconic of all engines.

37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,360
Yeah, baby.

38
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,879
And since I had the home advantage,

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,320
I took the producer's brief and...
well, I nailed it.

40
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,919
The Ford Mustang.

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,159
The original American V8
performance icon, huh?

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,079
And this isn't just any
Ford Mustang -

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,919
no, no, no, no, no, no.

44
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,199
This is the raciest Mustang Ford
makes, the GT350R.

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,760
Carbon fibre wheels, a 5.2-litre V8
motor that makes 520 horsepower.

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,679
Only this one... doesn't.

47
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,599
Because in the finest Mustang
tradition of taking a fast thing

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,359
and making it even faster,

49
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,119
this particular GT350R

50
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,919
has been lightly enhanced
by a man from Texas.

51
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,039
A man called Mr Hennessey.

52
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,080
Oh. Ssh, ssh. OK, here we go.

53
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,319
And while I had embraced the V8
brief and used my imagination...

54
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,079
Oh, yeah! That's right.

55
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,319
..it appeared Rory... hadn't.

56
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,959
The Jaguar F-Type SVR.

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,519
- Yeah. - Yeah, isn't this great?

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,719
I mean, you brought a V8 muscle car,
I brought a V8 muscle car.

59
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,159
No, no. No.

60
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,999
No, I brought a V8 muscle car,
you brought...

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,479
..a Jaguar.

62
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,839
Well, this is Britain's answer
to the muscle car.

63
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,279
We had a look at your rough sketch
and we refined it.

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,999
This is muscle car 2.0.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,519
How much power does it make?

66
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,279
575 horsepower.

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,519
Wow, impressive! Yeah. Wow!

68
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,959
How about yours?

69
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,759
I don't know, really.
I don't know. Mustang...

70
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,919
What do you mean you don't know?

71
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,319
This is a supercharged version.

72
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,039
Wait a minute -
is this the Hennessey?

73
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,119
- Is it? - This thing makes
850 horsepower!

74
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,359
Does it?!

75
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,239
Ooh!

76
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,360
Lucky me!

77
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,559
Then along came Chris...

78
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,839
Well, well, well.

79
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,639
..with HIS idea of a
great all-rounder.

80
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,799
Absolute shambles.

81
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,719
4 million miles of paved road
in America,

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,919
and they tell us to meet
in a pit full of rocks.

83
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,119
Worse still, it sounded like
a 1980s arcade.

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,479
Gentlemen! Behold the McLaren 570GT.

85
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,119
How's the, er, ground clearance?

86
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,359
Absolutely terrible.

87
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,679
When they said "road trip,"

88
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,959
I thought it might involve
actual roads.

89
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,399
Chris, this is the Wild West.

90
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,439
You've got to be prepared
for anything!

91
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,799
Well, I suppose I am,

92
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,439
because this is basically two cars
for the price of one, isn't it?

93
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,399
On the one hand, it is still
a proper supercar, crazy fast.

94
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,119
But it's also a comfortable GT car.

95
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,719
In fact it's three cars -
check this out...

96
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,399
It's also an estate car!

97
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,440
Look at this!

98
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,559
Wow. You could seriously fit
a couple of sheets of A4 in there.

99
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,999
And not that flimsy stuff,
I'm talking about the thick...

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,319
The stuff you use, like,
for a cover page, the good stuff?

101
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,599
We're supposed to be celebrating the
evolution, OK,

102
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,319
- of the V8 sports car. - Right.

103
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,639
You've brought a car that
desperately wants it to be 1965.

104
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,439
- Yeah. - And you've also brought a car

105
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,559
that desperately wants it
to be 1965.

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,039
- So...? - I'm in the present day,
you're in the past,

107
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,199
as is confirmed by your shirt.

108
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,999
Right. What are you laughing at?
Let's not get on shirts!

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,399
Let's not get on shirts!

110
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,439
I look good! You do look good.

111
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,519
- You look... You're on fire.
- I've never seen a label

112
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,759
riveted to a T-shirt before.

113
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,559
That's remarkable, that is.

114
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,879
But before we could get to the
bottom of who looked least awful,

115
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,999
a local turned up
in an old Ford pick-up.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,159
Ooh, that sounds a bit V8-y,
what's that?

117
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,839
They do burble nicely, V8s,
don't they?

118
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,079
Burble, burble.

119
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,679
- How are you? - Here you go.

120
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,200
Oh, thank you. Nice ride.

121
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,119
OK. "You and your V8 sports cars
will now drive

122
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,959
"to America's fastest race track
on the Nevada border.

123
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,399
"Along the way, you will undertake
a series of challenges

124
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,520
"to discover which of your V8s
is best."

125
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,999
So, with the Nevada border
a couple of days ahead of us,

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,359
we had some road to cover.

127
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,800
But, of course, first,
that meant finding it.

128
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,919
This is the quintessential American
V8 right here, the Mustang.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Oh, yeah!

130
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,599
Buying it is just the start.

131
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,159
Then you get busy giving it more
power, bigger brakes,

132
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,879
probably even more power.

133
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,200
It's the American way!

134
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,639
The 570GT is the most relaxed car
that McLaren makes, right?

135
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,239
It's got softer suspension
and it's quieter on the road -

136
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,439
or at least it would be
if I was on a road!

137
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,640

- Oh!

138
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,159
Oh-ho-ho!

139
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,080
There is a very good reason
why I chose the Jaguar F-Type SVR.

140
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,999
I chose this because it has
all-wheel drive,

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,479
and that means it's ready
for anything.

142
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,119
It's unflappable.

143
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,280
Suave.

144
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,480
Like me.

145
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,159
But soon, it was time to find out

146
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,000
just how unflappable
our V8s really were...

147
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,760
..because getting out of this valley
would take a bit of a climb.

148
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,479
This looks like a very bad idea.

149
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,760
Dear Lord!

150
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,239
One mistake up here,
and you're looking at

151
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,320
a very, very painful accident.

152
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,520
Look at the remnants
of that car there!

153
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,640
But none of that seemed to trouble
the cowboy and his Mustang.

154
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,759
Careful, Matt,
what the hell are you doing?!

155
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,759
Coming round the top, boys!

156
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,519
Whoo!

157
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,920
Supposed to be a road trip!

158
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,160
God, look what we've just come up!

159
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,800
That would be a beautiful death!

160
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,759
With the valley behind us,
waiting at the top...

161
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,239
Hey, a paved road! Look at this!

162
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,279
Yes!

163
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,080
Finally, our V8s
could stretch their legs.

164
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,200
This is where the real test begins.

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,400
Ho-ho!

166
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,839
Whoo!

167
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,039
Do you hear that, boys?

168
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,599
That is the sound of
an American V8 in the wild -

169
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,240
the greatest noise in the world!

170
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,119
I don't mean to be pernickety here,

171
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,439
but that's not
an American V8, really,

172
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,799
is it, Matt? Because that's
a flat-plane V8 sound,

173
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,399
and most American V8s
are cross-plane V8s,

174
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,879
so what you've got there
is a European V8

175
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,559
in an American body shell.

176
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,760
That's about as American
as Silvio Berlusconi!

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
Who is she?

178
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,239
This is the coupe version of the car
that I drove from Coventry to Geneva

179
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,679
a couple of years ago.

180
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,839
At the time, I said that was
the fastest Jaguar ever,

181
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,319
but that's not quite true,

182
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,880
because THIS is
the fastest Jag ever.

183
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,039
This will do 200mph.

184
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,759
The fixed roof actually improves
top speed by 5mph.

185
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,159
It's the same reason Chris Harris
is so fast.

186
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,440
It's all down to his dome!

187
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,839
Most supercars, they're a pain
to live with, they really are.

188
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,559
But the 570GT, it just isn't.

189
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,799
This car is supple,
it's comfortable,

190
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,519
it's practical, and on this road...

191
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,720
I'm in the firm suspension setting
now - if I go to comfort...

192
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,480
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

193
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,000
Whoa!

194
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,319
Oh, that McLaren is quick!

195
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,079
Hey, Chris, what's the 0-60 on that?

196
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,559
About three and a half seconds.

197
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,079
About the same as mine.

198
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,679
Matt? Yeah, about three and a half
seconds maybe.

199
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,959
Maybe less, I don't know,

200
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,719
- right around there. - OK, OK -
how about a shoot-out?

201
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,759
- A what? - Take the next left.
Next left.

202
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,520
And suddenly we were off-road again.

203
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,320
Oh, you're going to love this.

204
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,680
There's nothing about this
I'm going to love.

205
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,199
Right, here's how
this is going to work.

206
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,839
Quickest on the draw,
like in those old cowboy films.

207
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,199
When I say go, you two head off,

208
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,679
opposite directions,
slow as you can,

209
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,439
but no touching the brakes.

210
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,999
When I come on the radio and say
draw,

211
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,919
spin around and head back.

212
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,759
First one across the line
is the winner.

213
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,999
This is completely childish.

214
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,679
You don't have to play.

215
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,079
Oh, I'm going to play.

216
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,600
Yeah, I'm going to win as well.

217
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,040
Buffalo LeBlanc, you ready?

218
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,839
Ready.

219
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,519
Crazy Eyes Harris, are you ready?

220
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,999
Crazy Eyes, who has...?

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,960
Stupid nicknames. Yeah, I'm ready!

222
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,399
Three, two...

223
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,279
..one...

224
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,320
Go!

225
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,440
He's not even moving!

226
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,440
Two can play at that game, LeBlanc.

227
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,559
I saw brake lights, Harris.

228
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,800
No brakes.

229
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,279
A duel in the dirt -

230
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,840
this is basically what this car
was designed to do.

231
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,199
He's got a locking differential.

232
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,919
He can turn on a sixpence if he just
does a little half-doughnut,

233
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
whereas I can't.

234
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,240
Curse you, McLaren, and your lack
of locking differentials!

235
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,599
V8 muscle car is a tool, as good
or as bad as the man handling it.

236
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,079
Remember that.

237
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,600
Yeah.

238
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,959
I'm going to get over
to one side now.

239
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,599
Wait for it.

240
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,799
Wait for it.

241
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,640
Come on, come on, come on, come on,
say it, say it, say it!

242
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,280
Draw!

243
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,640
Ho-ho!

244
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,880
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

245
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,479
Yes, baby!

246
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,159
- Chris is the winner! - Ha-ha-ha!

247
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,319
Damn it, he got me!

248
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,079
Oh!

249
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,919
- Oh! - Chris has taken it!

250
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,199
Chris, in the McLaren!

251
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,999
Well done, mate.

252
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,399
Thanks for that! Cheers!

253
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,279
So, with the Mustang
out of the game,

254
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,519
would the Jag be any quicker
on the draw?

255
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,359
OK, Crazy Eyes Harris,
are you ready?

256
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,799
- I'm ready. - Rory...

257
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,160
Odd Taste In Clothing -
are you ready?

258
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,399
Never been readier!

259
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,679
Three, two, one...

260
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,960
Go!

261
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,519
OK, we're off.

262
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,479
Oh, he's had to creep away
faster than me.

263
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,839
Man, this is so counterintuitive.

264
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,119
I've got 570-odd horsepower

265
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,040
and I can only use
about three right now!

266
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,320
Who will it be?

267
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,039
Four-wheel drive, a massive
advantage for him

268
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,639
when it comes to heading
back towards the finish line.

269
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,839
But I'm not convinced that he can
turn as well as me,

270
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,719
cos I can spin turn, and he can't.

271
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,160
All right, come on, Reid, come on,
come on, come on.

272
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,519
- He's moving to one side...
- Get ready, get ready, get ready.

273
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,680
And draw!

274
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,080
Come on! Come on, baby!

275
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,599
Made it!

276
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,759
Oh-ho-ho!

277
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,239
Whoo! Come on!

278
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,159
Oh, I think I got duffed up there.

279
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,839
Rory by a mile!

280
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,519
I think, yes, an actual mile!

281
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,160
- Oh! - Ha-ha!

282
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,799
That, gentlemen, is what you call
a spectacular win.

283
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,959
- Here it comes. - I just beat
a McLaren, in a Jag!

284
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,159
I didn't stand a chance.

285
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,559
All-wheel drive Jag -
wasn't going to beat that.

286
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,679
You were gone.

287
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,640
Are you doing the dance IN the car?

288
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,960
Yeah, a little bit. A little bit.

289
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,759
Just to confirm, er,
I'm not done winning.

290
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,800
Right.

291
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,279
So, as Rory took winning the
challenge he'd just made up

292
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,159
with his typical good grace...

293
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,560
Oh, it feels good to be a winner!

294
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,320
..we got back on the road.

295
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,839
The Jaguar F-Type.

296
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,639
Know what that says about you, Rory?

297
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,159
What does it say about me?

298
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,199
- It says you couldn't afford
an Aston Martin. - Oh!

299
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,999
Soon, we were told to head to
a mystery location

300
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,800
for our first proper tribute
to the V8.

301
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,320
What is this place?

302
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,240
I don't know.
But it looks kind of creepy.

303
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,799
- Who's he? - It appears to be
a challenge, gentlemen.

304
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,759
Thank you. It says here,

305
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,559
"The V8 sports car can trace its
roots back to the prohibition era,

306
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,399
"when moonshine runners needed speed
and performance to evade the police.

307
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,079
"To prove the speed and performance
of your V8s,

308
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,400
"you will now each run a crate of
moonshine to the state line."

309
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,679
So, this tribute to the V8 moonshine
runners of old

310
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,919
would be a chase through
a sprawling industrial complex,

311
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,280
finishing at a hastily knocked
together...

312
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,959
..border post.

313
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,159
"PS - get a move on.

314
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,919
"As soon as Officer Block finishes
his doughnut,

315
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,320
"he'll be in hot pursuit."

316
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,039
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Officer Block?

317
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,240
Ken Block?!

318
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,959
Yes. Because no chase would be
complete without a bit of company,

319
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,999
we'd be pursued by legendary
Sheriff of the Slide,

320
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,359
Ken Block.

321
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,639
My buddy!

322
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,519
Me and Ken, we go way back!
Yeah! K-Dog! K-Money! Big-K...

323
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,759
Special-K is what I call him.

324
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,159
Very heart-warming story, Matt,

325
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,519
but Officer Block appears to have
turned to the dark side.

326
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,279
He's a member of the law now. Let's
load up and get out of here, OK?

327
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,040
- Copy that. - Shine time!

328
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,920
Go, go, go, go, go!

329
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,120
- Are you ready? - Hit it! Go!

330
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,279
Which way are we going?

331
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,320
This is sketchy.

332
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,440
He's coming!

333
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,200
He's right behind you, Rory!

334
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,879
With the pursuit gathering momentum,

335
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,200
it seemed like a good opportunity
to assess our cars' handling.

336
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,479
Ah, this four-wheel drive
is perfect for this!

337
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,079
This thing just grips!

338
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,880
I can throw it into a corner,
get on the power super early...

339
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,640
..and it just goes!

340
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,159
God, this thing is so fast.

341
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,439
But it's small and it's nimble.

342
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,679
That's what McLaren is all
about, it's about handling.

343
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,440
I've got handling to spare here.

344
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,160
One-handage!
One-handed shine escape!

345
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,479
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

346
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,239
It's got so much grip!

347
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,080
And the steering is like a razor.

348
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,640
So aggressive.

349
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,039
OK...

350
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,480
I mean, I don't like running
from the law, but...

351
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,400
..this is awesome!

352
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,080
Whoa!

353
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,679
- Go, Chris - go, go, go!
- He's right behind me!

354
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,839
Man, this guy really
wants my moonshine!

355
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,679
All right, we've got to lose him,
you guys.

356
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,879
We need to split up. Rory,
you go right, we'll go left.

357
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,400
- Go right, go right.
- Good idea, good idea.

358
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,999
No, no, no, no.
Bad idea, bad idea!

359
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,280
How do I get out, how do I get out?

360
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,960
Argh!

361
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,879
Hey, Ken.

362
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,400
You know what rhymes with block?
C...

363
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,680
- Oh-ho-ho...
- Harris, where are you going?

364
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,239
Relentless.

365
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

366
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,960
Hey, buddy!

367
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,680
Whoa!

368
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,880
That's not friendly at all.

369
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,040
How far have I got to go?
Where is he?

370
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,800
Oh, my Lord.

371
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,680
He's so much quicker than me.
He can go across the grass, I can't.

372
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,160
Oh, my God!

373
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,840
Oh, ho-ho!

374
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,160
I can see a border!

375
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,200
Oh, it's sketchy,
the tyres are going.

376
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,240
Get through the border,
get through the border...

377
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,720
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

378
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,999
OK, we'll pick that up
later in the show.

379
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,479
But now it's time to put
a star in our reasonably fast car.

380
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,679
He's one of Britain's
best loved comedians,

381
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,239
he's had a number one hit single,

382
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,799
and, most impressively,

383
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,039
once owned a Mitsubishi Carisma.

384
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,959
And earlier today, he got some
training out on the track

385
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,399
with Mr Charisma himself,

386
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,639
Chris Harris.

387
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,999
- Yeah, I've missed you.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

388
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,800
please welcome to the sofa
Rob Brydon.

389
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Hello. Hello.

390
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,119
- Nice to see you. - Hello.
- How are you, buddy?

391
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,999
Nice to see you, Rob.
Great to meet you. Welcome, welcome.

392
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,159
Cheers. Thank you. Thank you.

393
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,359
All right. Now you've driven round
the track here before,

394
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,199
how did you like the new GT 86?

395
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,799
Before we say anything else,

396
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,879
it's soaking wet.

397
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,599
It is wetter than the worst day

398
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,399
of Noah and Mrs Noah
when they're saying,

399
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,879
"Have we got enough wood?" That is
so wet. It was wet, wasn't it?

400
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,199
- It was wet. - So, the time
is not going to be great, Matt.

401
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,119
So you're saying it's wet.

402
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,639
It was moist!

403
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,399
OK. And how was Chris as a teacher?

404
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,239
He's, yeah, I mean,
an acquired taste, you know.

405
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,759
You know that saying?
Oh, you don't have to tell me!

406
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,279
Yeah. No, he was good. He was good.

407
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,719
Right. OK. Well, let's take
a look at how the training went,

408
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,199
what do you think?

409
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,439
I've never noticed before,
at the start...

410
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,079
- Yeah? - You see the ambulance
and the fire thing.

411
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,199
We always keep those there just to
remind you

412
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,039
- of the importance of your own
safety. - All right, count me down.

413
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,799
OK. Three, two, one, go.

414
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,120
It's a great launch.

415
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,159
And we're going to the left of those
tyres. Left, left, left, left.

416
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,239
- What? Oh, BLEEP. - Left of those tyres
there. - What? LEFT of those tyres?

417
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,999
Yeah, right now, right now,
right now.

418
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,559
- What are you talking about?
- Right! Go right there. - Where?

419
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,919
- Right there. - There?!
- Yeah, turn... - What, by the...?

420
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,399
- By the aeroplanes?
- No, no, before the aeroplanes.

421
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,359
Did you do the medical
before you came on?

422
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,359
- Shut up. - Left here now, left here.

423
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,439
- There's, there's your two white
lines. And then to the right. - Oh!

424
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,439
- Now it's coming back.
- Now it's flowing.

425
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,279
Oh, Lord Almighty, we're fast.

426
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,519
OK, left here, left here.

427
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,359
Oh, oh, oh!

428
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,399
Fourth. Fourth, fourth, fourth.

429
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,319
- Fourth. - That's sixth. That's sixth.
- Really, you want to be fourth here?

430
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,919
- That's sixth, that's sixth,
that's sixth. - Oh. - That's second.

431
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,559
- That's fourth!

432
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,279
- We've got to fourth. - That's good,
you've got some feel for this now,

433
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,839
- haven't you? - Oh, lordy.
- But can you feel... - Whoa!

434
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,399
I'm not sure you know how
close you are

435
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,239
- to a massive accident.

436
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,959
- But let's just go through here...
- Oh, sugary!

437
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,759
Oh. I don't like that.

438
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,639
That is scary.

439
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,279
Full beans, full beans,
over the line.

440
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,199
- Over the line!
- That is so frustrating.

441
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,679
I want your honest opinion...

442
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,839
- Yeah... - ..on the level of support
you've received

443
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,999
- during your training.
- Very poor. Very poor.

444
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,919
I would say my coach is more
interested in himself

445
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,239
than in his young...

446
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,120
his young apprentice.

447
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,159
Well, I don't know.

448
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,799
Looks like you did pretty good
considering it's a lake out there.

449
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,679
But cars are in your blood,
your dad sold cars?

450
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,279
Yeah, my dad was a car salesman.
So when I grew up in south Wales,

451
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,559
in Port Talbot, he'd often bring
different cars back every day.

452
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,479
So I got used to seeing these
different ones

453
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,919
coming back and forth to the house.

454
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,839
And then years later,
he worked for Mitsubishi.

455
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,279
Hence the Carisma.

456
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,399
- Ah, there it is. - Is that known
as being a very bad car, then?

457
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,359
- Oh, it's terrible. - Is it?

458
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,639
- Yeah. - Oh, is that it?

459
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,399
- That's it right there. - Look at the
way the indicator on the left

460
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,479
isn't flush with the headlight,
but the one on the right is.

461
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,439
You see? I mean,
they couldn't even be bothered

462
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,999
to get a good one
for the press photo.

463
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,119
I think, I think what you're
encountering here

464
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,359
for the first time, Chris,

465
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,039
is called perspective.

466
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,439
Ah!

467
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,599
You know how on the left side,
it looks bigger?

468
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,880
Yeah, it's just closer.

469
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,639
OK. And what do you drive now?

470
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,799
At the moment, I have a Jaguar XJ,
and a Land Rover Discovery.

471
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,359
- Oh, dear. - The new one?
- Oh, dear. - Yeah, what's the problem?

472
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,679
What have I done now?!
The new Discovery?

473
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,119
- Yeah. - So you've seen it? - Oh, boy.

474
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,119
- You've seen it from the outside?
- Oh, you're talking...?

475
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,959
- I know, I noticed. - You've opened
a can of worms... - The back of it.

476
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,079
I'm talking about all of it.
Let's start with the sides.

477
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,919
- We'll leave the worst bit till last.
- The sides are OK.

478
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,039
- What's wrong with that?
- Look how much metal there is

479
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,719
- above the rear wheel. Look at it.
- Is that an issue for normal people?

480
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,919
- It is!

481
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,439
Let's move round to the back.

482
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,559
Now, look at the lack
of symmetry here.

483
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,279
- Yeah, I agree. - So, they designed
the whole thing,

484
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,839
at the last minute
someone's run in and gone,

485
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,599
"We've got to put the
number plate somewhere!"

486
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,679
So they've just slapped it there.

487
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,039
And the design inspiration for it,
here we go.

488
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,159
It's designed as an homage
to Geoffrey Boycott's mouth.

489
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,999
It... It is curious, but sometimes
innovation startles us at first.

490
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,599
- It does, it does.
- Where do you stand?

491
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,520
Er... Well, I think it's hideous.

492
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,519
- The Trip. Let's talk about The Trip.
- Yes. Yeah. Tell us about The Trip.

493
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,839
Oh, I'm a huge fan.
Who's a fan of The Trip here?

494
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,919
Yeah.

495
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,879
- It's fantastic.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

496
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,399
- Very funny. - We drove...
- Does that bring back good memories?

497
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,079
Yeah, that was The Trip To Italy,
which was the second one.

498
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,639
Why choose a Mini Cooper
convertible?

499
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,879
Oh! The Mini was... That was lovely.

500
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,399
Especially, you know, you had
a lot of windy country roads,

501
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,799
especially on the Amalfi coast.

502
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,559
It was lovely to drive.
In fact, I liked it so much,

503
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,559
I actually bought one
when we came back.

504
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,599
- Ooh. What?! - What's wrong with that?

505
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,799
Why would you do that? Cos it was...
It was a really nice drive.

506
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,359
Was it like that rose you have
when you go on holiday?

507
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,199
You know, the four euro rose.

508
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,839
And it's great when you're there...

509
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,639
And you crack a bottle open
three weeks later back in the UK,

510
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,399
- and it tastes like vinegar.
- It's not... It's not quite the same

511
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,199
driving it around Twickenham,

512
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,919
or, you know, as it was
on the Amalfi coast,

513
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,839
- but no, look, I'm going to...
It was a lovely car. - One question.

514
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,279
- Do you still own it? - No.

515
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,799
How long did you own it for?

516
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,279
I don't know, I had it for a year
and a bit, something like that.

517
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,559
Why so long?

518
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,439
I think it's time to see your lap.

519
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,359
Ah. Let's move on to that.

520
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,119
Can I... Did I mention it was wet?
You did mention it was wet.

521
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,519
- But you had fun? - Oh...

522
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,679
It's a blast, right?
It's fantastic. It's really fun.

523
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,039
OK, let's take a look.

524
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,799
Hey, you know what, why don't
you commentate on it?

525
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,199
OK, all right. Here we go.

526
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,959
Well, perfect conditions
for the youthful Rob Brydon.

527
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,199
It's a nice start.

528
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,679
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

529
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,999
Something is flashing
on the dashboard.

530
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,319
I don't know what it means.

531
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,279
That classic Roman profile gripping
the wheel with assuredness

532
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,439
and a strange sensuality.

533
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,639
And he takes that corner with ease.

534
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,799
Look at the way he's going.

535
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,279
And have you noticed it's wet?

536
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,720
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...

537
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,039
Difficult corner, difficult corner,

538
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,199
difficult to see
the white lines there,

539
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,239
but he's done it beautifully.

540
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,919
The inquest heard that although
he took the corner smoothly,

541
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,479
Brydon hadn't anticipated the...

542
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,640
..group of nuns visiting
the aerodrome.

543
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,839
He took out six of them.

544
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,079
Thoughts with the families.

545
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,639
Yes, you don't want to hear
the word "inquest" in your head

546
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,280
when you're doing this lap.

547
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,640
I have to say, Gav, it's a lot
quicker than the Picasso.

548
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,719
This bit, now, I think I got speed
up here, and look at that.

549
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,279
That's not bad, is it?

550
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,119
This looks narrower...

551
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,039
..every time you go through it!

552
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,519
Oh, bloody hell. That was scary.

553
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,599
Oh, Robert! There's no need
for that sort of language,

554
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,399
- you - BLEEP - idiot.

555
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,439
Oh, you...! Damn it.

556
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,999
And he comes now to his jinx,
his nemesis, this penultimate...

557
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,719
Oh, no, he didn't. That was the end!

558
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,160
That shows you how well
I know the course, right?

559
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,200
- That's wet. - Ah.

560
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,319
I've never seen it that wet.

561
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,239
That's monsoon conditions.

562
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,639
I've never seen it that wet.

563
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,799
Well, there we are, then,
whatever the time was...

564
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,639
- Well, I have it right here. - Ah.

565
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,079
- What do you think? - I just want
to beat Tinie Tempah, really.

566
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,999
- You do? - I just feel
in the world of rap,

567
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,719
I feel Tinie is always, you know,

568
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,999
threatening my territory.

569
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,279
So, I just want to let him know.
I'm a big rap star in this country,

570
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,399
you wouldn't know this, Matt,
but, er, I want to beat him.

571
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,199
It was definitely wetter for you
than it was for Tinie.

572
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,999
I think we're going to call
your time, not just with a W,

573
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,239
we're going to put a VW.

574
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,879
VW, thank you. Very wet, yeah.

575
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,479
Thank you. OK, Rob Brydon,
are you ready?

576
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,919
Mmm-hmm. You went around the track
in one minute...

577
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,959
..50...

578
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,879
Oh, for heaven's sake, so I'm
already down the bottom section.

579
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,919
..point... five.

580
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:19,159
- So I'm just...!
- Oh! It's tough! Sorry, boss.

581
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,639
- Great effort. - Yeah, well, I tried.
It was very wet.

582
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,359
I tried. It was very, very wet.
Ladies and gentlemen, Rob Brydon.

583
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,120
- Fantastic, thanks so much. - Ah...

584
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,639
Earlier on, you remember we were
celebrating the V8 engine

585
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,799
with a classic American road trip.

586
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,359
We'd escaped from a big pit,

587
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,039
staged a good old-fashioned
Wild West shoot out

588
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,639
and had a run-in with the law.
Standard road trip stuff.

589
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,920
Now it's time to head back to Utah
and pick up the story.

590
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,640
The next morning,
we were back on the road again.

591
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,759
And heading towards our destination
on the Nevada border,

592
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,160
we had time to reflect on what we
were really here to celebrate.

593
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,999
There's a personality about the V8

594
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,919
that no other engine configuration
can match, OK?

595
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,799
A V12 is the most exotic
engine configuration.

596
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,039
If you say I've got a V12,

597
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,079
you think of the most expensive,
exotic Italian supercars.

598
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,959
If you think, got a V6,
you're better than ordinary,

599
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,999
but ultimately you're
not the really fast model.

600
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,759
If you say your car's got a V8

601
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,400
it automatically makes it sound like
it's... It's the one you want.

602
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,679
Petrol engines are dying out,
there's no debate about that.

603
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,479
And I can see pros and cons to that.

604
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,359
But it really would be a shame
to lose the V8.

605
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,999
For me...

606
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,160
..the V8 is sacred.

607
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,039
I remember when I was a kid,
I was 16 and a half, and my cousin,

608
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,359
he had saved up his money
to buy a car.

609
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,759
And he bought a 1968 Chevy Camaro
with a 327 V8 in it.

610
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,319
So I had my license before him,

611
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,679
and he really wanted to drive
the car but he couldn't.

612
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,279
So I talked him into,
"Well, let's take the car out.

613
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,959
"I'll drive."

614
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,639
It was like my first
experience with a V8.

615
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,319
That thing was great.

616
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,439
By the time he got his licence,
the transmission needed a rebuild

617
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,920
- cos I beat the - BLEEP - out of it.

618
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,520
You're welcome.

619
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,479
Eager to continue
our V8 celebration,

620
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,560
we were told to head
to a local racetrack.

621
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,679
Rocky Mountain Raceways.

622
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,600
An oval circuit,
which could only mean one thing...

623
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,120
..Nascar.

624
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,359
Wow! You know where we are?

625
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,399
- Where? - It was 1957,

626
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,639
the final race of the Nascar season.

627
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,239
Bubba Passwater's got to finish
third to secure the title.

628
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,399
OK, on the last lap, he's third
coming out of the final corner,

629
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,919
right over there. As he gets onto
the straightaway, he gets tapped,

630
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,839
he corrects, clips the wall - boom!

631
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,439
The car goes up in a ball of flames.

632
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,559
He is out of control.
He spins across the line backwards,

633
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,399
takes the title by a single point.

634
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,640
Really? No, I have no idea
where we are.

635
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,519
Luckily, a local man
on a golf buggy did.

636
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,800
Here we go.

637
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,599
- Hello. - Hello. - Hello.

638
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,519
- There you go. - Thank you very much.

639
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,040
Ooh... Ooh!

640
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,359
It's a challenge. "In a tribute
to America's favourite motorsport,

641
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,639
"you will each attempt to set the
fastest time over five flying laps."

642
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,720
And we'd each get some help
from the real deal.

643
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,359
Born back in the '40s,

644
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,639
when moonshine runners
took their outlaw V8s

645
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,040
and started to race them...

646
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,919
..70 years on,

647
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,520
Nascar remains America's
most popular V8 motor sport.

648
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,440
Big on noise...

649
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,679
..if a little short on variety.

650
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,319
Wait, wait, so let me
get this straight.

651
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,319
We just go up there, take a left...

652
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,319
There. And then what, it's a left?
Over there.

653
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,799
- Rory... - And then left...
- ..these are simple people, OK?

654
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,440
- You've met Matt. Let's go.
Come on. - He's right.

655
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,720
That's cold.

656
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,839
For this Nascar-inspired test,

657
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,079
we would each be timed over
five laps of the track.

658
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,479
For the first two laps,

659
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,839
we would pick up some extra speed
by slipstreaming the pace car

660
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,800
before overtaking for a three-lap
sprint to the finish.

661
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,719
I'll try and explain it.

662
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,199
The car in front is bashing
a great big hole in the air, OK?

663
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,759
So you nudge in behind that car,
you get the benefit of that hole.

664
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,800
So you've got less air resistance,
ergo, you travel faster.

665
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,720
That's quick. That's loud.

666
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,840
I've got to judge when to duck out
to get my maximum aero advantage.

667
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,519
Time it right,
and it's called the slingshot.

668
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,760
I'm going!

669
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,919
It's quite physical.

670
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,880
You have to really brace yourself.

671
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,519
Whoa!

672
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,959
That... is tiring.

673
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,800
So, with Chris having demonstrated
the theory...

674
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,240
..Rory was up next.

675
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,080
I'm following a Nascar.

676
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,720
Dear Lord.

677
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,239
When Jaguar developed
the F-type SVR,

678
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,599
do you think they thought about
bringing it to an oval in Utah?

679
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,119
Probably not.

680
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,319
Wait for it, wait for it,
wait for it, wait for it.

681
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,159
- And once he cleared the pace
car... - NOW!

682
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,319
..Rory found driving round
in circles

683
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,679
much more difficult than he thought.

684
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,559
OK, late apex, late apex.

685
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,839
That's got to be the secret, right?

686
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,559
Oh, that's too high.

687
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,719
Turn it in, turn it in, turn it in.

688
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,400
He's just added about a quarter
of a mile to his lap there.

689
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,599
But what he lacked in technique...

690
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,520
Bravery, bravery, bravery.

691
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,079
..he made up for in recklessness.

692
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,919
That is close to the wall!
That is close to the wall.

693
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,439
Whoa!

694
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,840
Yes!

695
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,560
Oh, my God!

696
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,639
Now I'm no mind-reader,

697
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,360
but it seemed like he was pleased
with his run.

698
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,959
That was quite
a proficient doughnut.

699
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,440
Finally, it was time to unleash
the 850-horsepower beast.

700
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,720
Which was a bit of a handful.

701
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,839
The thing has got so much power
that I don't dare pin it

702
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,480
until I get it straightened out.

703
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,040
All right, here he goes, I'm going.

704
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,800
- That sounds fantastic. - Mega.

705
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,399
The grip in the front end
of this thing is awesome.

706
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,960
It's like King Kong.

707
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,520
- Well, it sounded good. - It did.

708
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,919
I mean, look at him.
He's just been following a Nascar,

709
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,319
he's in a hopped-up Mustang,
in Utah, on a short oval -

710
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,519
he's basically in American heaven,
isn't he?

711
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,320
Give that man a foot-long wiener
and he's complete.

712
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,319
Ah, this must be the times!

713
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,999
- Here we go. - Bring it.

714
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,560
Thank you. Yeah, go back that way,
it's easier.

715
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,239
"Matt LeBlanc.
You did it in one minute...

716
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,959
"30.6.

717
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,120
"Rory. You did it in one minute...
30...

718
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,520
"one..."

719
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,079
It might get better. "..point four."

720
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,839
- So, it doesn't.
- You got closer to him.

721
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,639
- I gotcha. - But you did have 200 more
horsepower than me, but well done.

722
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,559
Oh, God, here we go, here we go.

723
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,279
- Yeah, yeah. "Chris Harris." - Come on.

724
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,959
- "You did it..." - Come on.

725
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,440
"in one minute..."

726
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,999
- Come on. - What do you want
to do for dinner? - Just...!

727
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,999
"Chris Harris, you did it
in one minute..."

728
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,119
Yep, next word, next word.

729
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,799
- "..20..." - Yes! - "..8.1."

730
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,479
- Congratulations. - Yes! - Way to go.

731
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,599
- You see? - Mr McLaren.
- Upholding Woking's honour.

732
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,839
Said no-one ever.

733
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,119
- Well done, well done. - Thank you.

734
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,359
- Congratulations. - I'm pleased with
that. - Now... "Your prize

735
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,679
"is to take part in one of America's
most exciting race events..."

736
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,959
Do I get to drive that?

737
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,519
"chain car figure of eight
racing."

738
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,879
- What? - What? - Chain car figure
of eight racing.

739
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,959
Says it right there. What's that?
How do I know?

740
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,599
Let me see those times.
I don't want to do it.

741
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,839
- But you have to. - I don't want to.

742
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,319
- But you have to.
- Well, I don't want to.

743
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,880
- But you have to. - So I have to...
I don't HAVE to do anything!

744
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,799
I'm sitting in a 1977 Pontiac

745
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,279
wondering why on earth I tried
to win that last challenge,

746
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,520
cos this is not a prize,
this is a punishment.

747
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,599
Yes! Figure of eight racing -

748
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,919
the greatest motorsport
we'd just heard of.

749
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,759
Three cars chained together

750
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,839
racing around a track
shaped like the number eight.

751
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,400
Which, of course, means a crossover
in the middle.

752
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,639
Better still,
with Harris in the rear car,

753
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,079
only controlling the brakes,

754
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,599
and the middle car
just an empty shell,

755
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,719
the driver in the front car would be
in charge of both the steering

756
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,439
and the acceleration.

757
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,119
So, it was essential that Chris
had a responsible,

758
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,639
safety-conscious team-mate.

759
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,880
Hey, buddy!

760
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,879
- Oh, God, no. - Let's smash some stuff!

761
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,880
No, let's not smash some stuff,
Sabine!

762
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,439
Lining up on the grid,

763
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,479
and with Chris still adjusting
to his new role...

764
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,799
Brake, Harris! Yeah.

765
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,919
- Oh, boom. - Sorry.

766
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,760
..Team Top Gear would be
starting at the back of the field.

767
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,960
This is ridiculous, it really is.

768
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,039
One of those cars is a hearse!

769
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,880
Perfect.

770
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,240
She just sounds demented.

771
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,159
- Woohoo! - It's on!

772
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,640
Go, go, go, go!

773
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,079
Apparently it would be
a six-lap race,

774
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,319
assuming, that is,
they'd last that long.

775
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,639
Whoa, Harris!

776
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,879
What's she doing?

777
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,840
Oh, my God!

778
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,039
- Whoo! - I've been in a car
with Sabine,

779
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,399
and it was one of the scariest
things I've ever done,

780
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,960
but I think this tops it.

781
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,559
Oh! Ow! Ow!

782
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,959
Nevertheless, by the end of
the first lap,

783
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,839
Sabine had somehow dragged them
up to fifth place.

784
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,959
- Yeah! - You're all right, Chris,
hang in there.

785
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,199
It looks like she knows
what she's doing.

786
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,079
- No, we don't know. - We don't.

787
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,399
But then...

788
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,600
- Oh, my...

789
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,479
Ow!

790
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,680
Whoa!

791
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,119
Scheisse!

792
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,479
Snared up by another chain car,

793
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,999
the rest of the field
started to pull away.

794
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,999
And by the time Sabine
broke them free...

795
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,279
Yeah!

796
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,239
Nice move, Sabine, way to go!

797
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,559
..the rest of the pack
were half a lap ahead.

798
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,000
Which, in figure of eight racing,
is a bit of a problem.

799
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,239
Ow!

800
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,999
Whoo!

801
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,759
Ow! Oh, my God.

802
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,559
This is the worst thing
I've ever done.

803
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,559
Unfortunately for Chris, though,

804
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,360
Sabine is no quitter.

805
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,519
Brake, Harris.

806
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,200
Whoo! Yeah! We got them!

807
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,120
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

808
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,719
Ow! Oh, my God!

809
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,759
And by now, the competition were
having problems of their own.

810
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,840
- Oh! There's a wreck up there.
- Whoa, Harris!

811
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,119
I can't see anything.

812
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,119
This is terrifying.

813
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,680
With two laps to go, Sabine had
clawed them back up to fourth.

814
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,400
But things were about to get uglier.

815
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,159
- Ow! - Chris, where are you?

816
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,839
Oh, not again.

817
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,439
Ow! This is carnage.

818
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,840
This is awesome!

819
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,359
Entering the final lap,
Sabine could sense a podium finish.

820
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,599
Yeah! I do! I do! I do!

821
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,439
And with just the final corner left,

822
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,039
she'd go through
the hearse to get it.

823
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,079
- On three! - Not through there, Sabine!

824
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,879
Not through there!

825
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,040
Whoo! Yes!

826
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,839
Push, push, push!

827
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,519
- Yeah! Way to go! Way to go! - Whoo!

828
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,719
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

829
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,640
Yeah! Woohoo!

830
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,239
Chequered flag. You're in third.
Way to go! Way to go! Way to go!

831
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,679
Woohoo! Yee-ha!

832
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,000
Chris, good job!
Are you still there?

833
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,559
Just.

834
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,919
You total lunatic.

835
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,879
With Chris choosing
not to stick around

836
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,959
to see what the prize
for third place was,

837
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,680
we got back on the road.

838
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,439
I think the greatest thing America
has given to planet Earth

839
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,799
is chain car racing. That was great.

840
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,880
It's one of our proudest moments,
really.

841
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,119
Sensing Chris didn't wholly agree,

842
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,479
and I hate seeing
the little guy upset,

843
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,399
I had an idea to cheer him up.

844
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,479
Hey, you know what?
I've got a game we could play.

845
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,880
It's called Nascar or Nas-can't.

846
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,559
So, I'm going to say a name and you
tell me if it's a real Nascar driver

847
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,839
or just someone that I've made up.

848
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,719
OK?

849
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,559
OK.

850
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,799
How about Lake Speed?

851
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,599
That sounds more like a place
than a person.

852
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,519
That's a real Nascar driver.

853
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,479
Lake Speed is Nascar driver?

854
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,360
Yes, it is. How about Dick Trickle?

855
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,199
THAT'S a real Nascar driver.

856
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,439
He's real, yeah.
OK, here's another one.

857
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,079
- Patty Grossman.
- Yeah, he sounds very Nascar.

858
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,599
That's my mother!

859
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,000
With Harris feeling better,
soon we all had a reason to smile.

860
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,600
Because our goal
at the Nevada border...

861
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,480
..was finally within reach.

862
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,400
Oh, I know where we're going.

863
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,360
I think I know where
we're going too.

864
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,799
Yeah...

865
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,240
Where are we going?

866
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,680
I think we're headed to Bonneville.

867
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,160
America's fastest race track.

868
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,359
For over a century,
pilgrims of extreme speed

869
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,400
have been drawn here
from all over the world...

870
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,280
..to 46 square miles of pristine
unbroken salt flats.

871
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,479
This is where the 300,
the 400, the 500,

872
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,560
even the 600mph land speed
barriers were broken.

873
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,160
This... is Bonneville.

874
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,119
I can't believe I'm here.

875
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,279
As we pulled onto the salt, though,

876
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,200
the dry lake bed
did have a bit of a problem.

877
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,879
Oh, no.

878
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,599
Well, this is... moist.

879
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,199
Freak rain had blown in,
flooding the flats

880
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,240
and washing away any chance
of a top speed run.

881
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,000
What the hell?

882
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,080
I'm absolutely gutted.

883
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,239
I've waited 30-odd years
to come to the Mecca of speed

884
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,919
and when I finally get here

885
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,160
it's a lake.

886
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,120
What are we going to do?

887
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,879
Hi.

888
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,919
- How are you? - Good. - Thank you.

889
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,239
- Sorry. - Hey, it's not your fault.

890
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,559
Or is it?

891
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,559
- No, no. - OK. "Chin up.

892
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,279
"Your celebration of V8s
isn't over yet.

893
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,999
"Just up the road is a race track

894
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,319
"where your new final challenge
awaits."

895
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,039
But it's not Bonneville, is it?

896
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,120
Well, yeah, but it's a racetrack, so
at least we'll be able to go fast.

897
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,479
Well, it's got to be
better than this.

898
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,079
Yeah. Come on.

899
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,759
Really? So that was Bonneville?

900
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,759
35 years waiting, and I stand
in front of a puddle and go again.

901
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,280
Well, you can get in if you want.

902
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,520
Gutted.

903
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,599
I suppose I've now got

904
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,559
one of the worst Bonneville stories
of anyone I know.

905
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,879
Rory, how are you feeling about it?

906
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,679
Yeah, I wanted to smash through
that 200mph barrier in this thing,

907
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,439
- but it wasn't to be. - What is
the top speed of that car, Rory?

908
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,919
Just over 200.

909
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,160
- How about you? - What is it exactly?

910
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,199
200.

911
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,399
So, how exactly were you going to
"smash through" the 200mph barrier?

912
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,639
I was hoping for a bit
of a tailwind.

913
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,880
Good answer.

914
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,559
But then, just up the road...

915
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,759
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look at this.

916
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,320
..Chris spotted an opportunity.

917
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,320
I'm turning in here.
Follow me in here. Come on.

918
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,199
Dude, the sign says
"no trespassing."

919
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,159
An open gate is an invitation,

920
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,559
and I have an itch to scratch.

921
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,759
Oh, yeah.

922
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:41,719
We'd stumbled across a very quiet,
very long runway.

923
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,240
This looks great.

924
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,159
All right, so what are we thinking?

925
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,919
- Drag race? - Yes, please!

926
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,760
It's time to let the big dog eat.

927
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,599
Here we go. Here we go.

928
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,679
How much power have you got again?

929
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,559
850 horsepower.

930
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,559
You may have 850, but I want to know
how much you can use in the first

931
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,079
- three gears. - What are you saying?

932
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,639
You can use more of your power
than I can use of mine?

933
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,799
I can use all of my power
in the first three gears.

934
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,759
I don't think you can use
even a small percentage of yours,

935
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,880
and hopefully by the time you get
going, I'm gone.

936
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,119
I'll tell you what, Chris,

937
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,039
you pull out yours and I'll pull out
just enough to beat you.

938
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,480
All right, are we doing this,
or what?

939
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,959
OK, I'll call it. We go on "go."

940
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,320
Three, two...

941
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,560
..one, go.

942
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,559
Oh, the Jag is gone!

943
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,360
I'm winning! I'm winning!

944
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,439
Whoo! I'm winning!

945
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,480
OK, no, I'm not.

946
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,959
Bye-bye, Mr Reid.

947
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,399
Where's the yellow car?

948
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,559
That's the one that's worrying me.

949
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,880
There's the red one.

950
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,159
Oh!

951
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,999
OK, 160.

952
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,679
I still can't see the yellow car.

953
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,479
170.

954
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,400
Come on! Hya! Hya! Hya!

955
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,680
199. 201. 203 over the line.

956
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,519
Damn it!

957
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,759
This is the baby McLaren.

958
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,919
This is the Ford Fiesta
of the McLaren range

959
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,959
and it just did 203 and smoked
an 850-horsepower Mustang.

960
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,920
Boy, that McLaren is fast.

961
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,679
So, as we hurried on our way again,

962
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,319
our impromptu drag race
had taught us

963
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,879
that naturally my McLaren
is devastatingly quick,

964
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,239
that Matt's Mustang can't actually
use 850 horsepower,

965
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,880
and that Rory had his own
unique take on the result.

966
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,119
Chris and Matt, do you know what
the speed limit is in the UK?

967
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,159
- Yes. - It's 70mph,

968
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,359
and I'd like to point out
that in that drag race up to 90mph

969
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,799
the F-Type SVR was in the lead,

970
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,879
therefore, in real-world situations,

971
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,799
this car is quicker than the McLaren

972
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,239
and an 850-horsepower Mustang.

973
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,399
Even by your standards, Rory, you're
fumbling around for a false glory.

974
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,079
No, no, no, no, no. I'm about
300 kilos heavier than that McLaren,

975
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,519
and about the same thing as that
giant fridge on wheels

976
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,319
that you're driving. But I think
I acquitted myself pretty well.

977
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,159
This is a great all-round car.

978
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,559
Yeah, I think I drove by you

979
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,879
like you forgot where
the accelerator was.

980
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,599
Listen, guys, come on, I think this
car did surprise you a little bit.

981
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,279
You might look at
this car and think,

982
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,560
it's no McLaren, it's no Hennessy,
but it's hanging in there.

983
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,959
I wasn't thinking that, no.

984
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,959
And before Rory could come up with
more ways

985
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,319
in which his Jag wasn't as quick,

986
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,159
we reached our V8s'
new final playground.

987
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,439
I see flags. I see flags.

988
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,399
Yeah, I see grandstands.
I see grandstands.

989
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,920
Could this be the scene of another
McLaren victory? I hear you ask.

990
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,960
Could this be the scene of another
McLaren victory? I hear you...

991
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,359
Now we're talking.

992
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,359
Whoo!

993
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,440
Look at the view.

994
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,119
Oh, yeah, look at that!

995
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,799
That is a GT40.

996
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,840
- Yeah. - That is beautiful.

997
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,159
Yes, the GT40.

998
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,999
1960s icon,

999
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,559
and ground-breaking,
Ferrari-beating,

1000
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,040
Le Mans-winning masterpiece.

1001
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,119
That is a legendary V8, right there.

1002
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,360
Hey, how are you? Oh, cool.
Right on, thank you.

1003
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,199
"For your final challenge,
you will now take on

1004
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,919
"one of the greatest V8s
of all time." That's true.

1005
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,399
That is really true. Which won't
be a problem, I don't think,

1006
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,519
because we've got more power,
better brakes, better...

1007
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,679
Uh-oh. That changes things.

1008
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,959
Does he have the correct visa?

1009
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,560
Is he allowed to be here?

1010
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,680
Unfortunately, he was.

1011
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,919
That is a magnificent sound.

1012
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,960
Wow.

1013
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,759
The Stig would set a time
for six laps of the circuit,

1014
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,239
a time which we would have to
then beat as a team.

1015
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,319
Pros and cons.

1016
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,879
We have more power,
more modern tyres and brakes.

1017
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,520
- Cons... - He has him. - Yeah.

1018
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,800
And all too soon,
Stig's six laps were up.

1019
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,519
10 minutes 11.4.

1020
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,959
OK, that's the combined time
to beat.

1021
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,679
So, to pit our V8s against the GT40

1022
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,240
we'd be running a relay
of two laps each.

1023
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,319
And with a standing start
for the first leg,

1024
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,279
we needed the best car for
pure off-the-line acceleration.

1025
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,119
All right, Rory, are you ready?

1026
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,839
Never been readier.

1027
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,999
Three, two...

1028
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,920
..one, go!

1029
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,880
Whoo!

1030
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,840
Sounds quick.

1031
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,879
All-wheel drive...

1032
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,440
..for the win.

1033
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,799
Spot your apex, Reid.
Spot your apex.

1034
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,639
There she is.

1035
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,479
On that power. Oh, that's good.

1036
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,680
So good.

1037
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,919
The engine is still making noise.

1038
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,640
- That's a good sign. - This means
that he's not rolled it.

1039
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,320
Yes! Yes!

1040
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,359
Oh, that's messy, Reid.
Come on, tidier, tidier.

1041
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,320
All right, so, I need
a 1:42 average lap time.

1042
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,319
- Yeah, he's kind of missed that one.
- He's overcooked that one.

1043
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,919
Oh, no, this is looking like a 1:45.

1044
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,960
Argh!

1045
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,160
- Focus, Rory. Focus. Focus. Focus.
- I'm focusing! I'm focusing!

1046
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,759
Come on, Rory. Here he comes.

1047
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,599
You should get in the car, maybe.

1048
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,319
- Oh. - I don't know if this
is good enough.

1049
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,720
I don't know.

1050
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,160
Come on, guys. Come on, guys.

1051
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,199
- Here we go. - Come on.

1052
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,799
Go, go, go, go, go!

1053
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,880
Push, Harris! Push!

1054
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,919
Two laps down,
and Rory's run in the Jag

1055
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,879
had left us six seconds
off the pace.

1056
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,959
To beat the GT40...

1057
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,759
Smooth, Chris. Smooth!

1058
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,000
..Chris and his McLaren
needed their A-game.

1059
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,959
This is a car that was doing 200mph
in a straight line

1060
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,640
but it's now agile and fast here.

1061
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,999
Oh, good line through there. Nice.

1062
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,639
Nice! Nice!

1063
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,840
Just floor it.

1064
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,160
Push, push, push!

1065
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,839
OK, that's a 1:38.

1066
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,159
- We've got a shot here.
- OK, that's good.

1067
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,120
I'm buying us some time now.

1068
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,119
Now just three seconds behind...

1069
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,680
All right, Chris, one more clean
one. One more clean one.

1070
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,839
..we were back in the hunt.

1071
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,839
OK, we're at 5:58, 5:59,
six minutes.

1072
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,720
Chris, come on. Push, push, push!

1073
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,400
Let's do it for America.
Don't let me down, girl.

1074
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,239
Go on, Matt. Go on, Matt.

1075
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,080
Come on, Matt. Launch it!

1076
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,639
All right, here we go. Here we go.

1077
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,800
This was it, the last leg.

1078
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,960
And however this tribute to the
greatest of all engines would end...

1079
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,280
..at least one thing was certain.

1080
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,239
That's it. That's the stuff.

1081
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:38,040
The V8 engine is a fighter, and one
that still packs a serious punch.

1082
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,799
Where are we at? - 7:30. 7:30.

1083
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,319
- Are we ahead of time, or..?
- We're on the edge.

1084
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,959
Come on, baby. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1085
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,080
Come on.

1086
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,320
Oh, it's got so much freaking power.

1087
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,520
Come on!

1088
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,480
All right, last lap.

1089
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,439
He's got to do the lap of his life.

1090
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,759
Come on, Mustang!

1091
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,440
Come on, LeBlanc, give it your best.
I want your best.

1092
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,000
Come on, Matt. Push!

1093
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,400
There we go. Come on.

1094
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,479
That's it, that's it, that's it.

1095
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,720
OK, here we go.

1096
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,880
Come on!

1097
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,839
So, the big question -

1098
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,639
did our exquisite array of
state-of-the-art V8 sports cars

1099
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,359
open up a can of whupass
on the old days?

1100
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,999
Well, we'll never know.
OK, on next week's show...

1101
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,439
- Hold on, Matthew. - What? What?

1102
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,399
- What? - You've got to give them
the answer.

1103
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,359
No, I don't got to give them
the answer.

1104
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,039
That's why they're here.
They want to know the times.

1105
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,439
Come on! Yes.

1106
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,039
OK, fine.

1107
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,439
We were two seconds slower.

1108
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,359
And I'm very disappointed
in you, Chris.

1109
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,119
- I was quicker than him. - Yeah, but
I don't expect anything from him.

1110
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,159
What?! OK, that's fair.

1111
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,759
- Fine. - Yeah. - But what
we're telling the viewers

1112
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,039
is that the best V8 sports car
money can buy

1113
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,559
is a 50-year-old V8 sports car
that's not actually for sale?

1114
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,119
Exactly, yeah.

1115
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,839
And on that essential piece
of consumer advice

1116
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,079
we must end the show.

1117
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,200
- See you next week. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
