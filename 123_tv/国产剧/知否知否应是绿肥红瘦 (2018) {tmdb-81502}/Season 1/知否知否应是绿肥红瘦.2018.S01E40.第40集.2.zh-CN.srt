1
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:07,291
Mum!

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,041
Dad!

3
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:18,750
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:26,041
- Bluey!

5
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:30,250
You ruined our game,
Rusty!

6
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,125
You ruined
<i>my </i>game!

7
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,041
You can't
play with us!

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,291
You're being mean!

9
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,208
Okay, okay,
calm down, children.

10
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,750
Let's get
to the bottom of this.

11
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:44,333
Rusty, tell me
your side of the story.

12
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:46,250
Okay, Calypso.

13
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,375
I was walking along
to Cozy Corner...

14
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,166
Hello,
doctor ladies.

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,041
Do you sell
crutches?

16
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,583
Aah!

17
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:57,750
...and they all went crazy!

18
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,166
They just started
yelling at me.

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,625
Oh, that's odd.

20
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,083
Yeah.

21
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,458
Bluey, what's your side of the story?

22
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:09,083
Well, we were playing doctors
in a baby hospital.

23
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,792
Next!

24
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,875
We were delivering
everyone's babies for them.

25
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,166
Ooh,
here comes your baby!

26
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,000
I've got a wet flannel.

27
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,166
Pop! It's a baby boy!

28
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,417
Thanks!
I'll call him Max.

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Congratulations. Next!

30
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,709
Ooh, that's me.

31
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:29,458
Indy wanted to play early baby,
like her sister in real life.

32
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:32,250
Bluey, can we pretend
my baby is coming,

33
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,667
but it's coming too early?

34
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,041
Oh, okay.

35
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,667
Doctor, I think
my baby is coming!

36
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,208
Oh, great!

37
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,125
But isn't it meant
to come this afternoon?

38
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,041
Yes, it must be early!

39
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,208
Early baby!

40
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:48,709
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Early Baby.

41
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,208
I'm a bit worried.

42
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,125
Everything's gonna be fine, Indy.

43
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,834
I've got
a wet flannel.

44
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:55,834
Here it comes! Pop!

45
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:57,041
Hooray!

46
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,000
It's a boy!

47
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,041
No, it's a girl.

48
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,750
I mean, it's a girl!

49
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,750
Hello.

50
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,125
I'm calling her Polly.

51
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,291
Great!
Okay, who's next?

52
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,750
No, Bluey!

53
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:14,166
Because Polly's
an early baby,

54
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,333
she needs to stay
in the hospital for a long time,

55
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,500
'cause she's
still very small.

56
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,709
Oh, oh, okay.

57
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,041
We can take care of her.

58
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,875
I can use my wet flannel!

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,458
Thanks, but before you
touch her,

60
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:29,917
you have to wash
your hands with soap.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,250
Got it.

62
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,000
This is where you wash
your hands, everyone.

63
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,083
Yeah.

64
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,875
But we need to put her
in, uh...

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,667
it's like a fish tank
with holes in it.

66
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,834
Aha!

67
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:42,208
What about this?

68
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,458
Yes!

69
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:44,834
I'll put Polly in for you.

70
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,083
Uh uh uh!
You need to wash your hands.

71
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,291
Oh, yeah!

72
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,375
I forgot.

73
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,959
There you go, Polly.

74
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,625
She likes reading lights.

75
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,667
Great.
Now what, Indy?

76
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,041
Mums aren't allowed
to stay at night,

77
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,875
so you need to tell me
to go home to sleep.

78
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,333
Oh, okay.

79
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,500
But I'll pretend that
I don't want to leave Polly.

80
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,125
Got it.

81
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,291
Okay now, sweetheart,
we'll look after her.

82
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,834
But I don't want
to leave Polly!

83
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:15,250
You have to be the bravest
you've ever been.

84
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:19,208
Okay, I'll be the bravest
I've ever been.

85
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,125
Goodnight, Polly.

86
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,041
Raaaah!

87
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,208
It's okay, Indy.

88
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,000
We'll take good care of her.

89
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,458
She's asleep!

90
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,250
Hello, doctor ladies.

91
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,333
Do you sell crutches?

92
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,041
Aah!

93
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:43,291
Ohh, I see.

94
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,083
I'm sorry, Indy.

95
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,083
I didn't know Polly
was your early baby.

96
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,542
That's okay, Rusty.

97
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,458
You can play with us if you want.

98
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,083
Great.

99
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,000
You just have to follow
the rules of their game.

100
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,083
Yeah, come on.

101
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,333
-Okay.

102
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:01,083
Oh, um,
before you all go,

103
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,667
can I ask a question?

104
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,959
Sure!

105
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,458
Rusty, why were you
looking for crutches?

106
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:08,458
Oh!

107
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,041
Well, Coco and I

108
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,125
were building
a castle out of blocks...

109
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,333
Rahh!

110
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,083
...when a huge dragon came.

111
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,250
Arrr!
Arrr!

112
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,667
Aah! The dragon's back!

113
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,333
Run, everybody!

114
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:25,458
Every day, he would come
to take one villager to eat.

115
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:26,875
Go away, dragon!

116
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,417
Rahh!

117
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,458
Give me a villager,
or I'll breathe fire

118
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,667
on your whole town!

119
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,834
Oh, my. What shall we do?

120
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:38,041
The townsfolk
had no choice.

121
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,917
They gave a villager
to the dragon.

122
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,625
To decide
who it would be,

123
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:47,041
they played
"Ip Dip Sky Blue."

124
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,834
Ip dip sky blue.
Who's it? Not you.

125
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:52,875
Not because you're dirty,
not because you're clean.

126
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,834
My mum says
you're the fairy queen!

127
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:58,083
They chose
the king's daughter!

128
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,417
"Oh, no!

129
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,166
I'm so upset!

130
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,041
I'll give my castle
to whoever takes her place."

131
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,959
But no one would.

132
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,792
But the king's daughter
was very brave.

133
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,291
She said to the king,
"Goodbye, father.

134
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:18,291
We both have to be
the bravest we've ever been."

135
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,750
No!

136
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:21,792
Hooray!

137
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,333
Rahh!

138
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:29,000
"Oh, my only daughter is gone!
Who will bring her back to me?"

139
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,458
I will, Your Majesty.

140
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:32,250
I'm a knight.

141
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,625
Aren't you scared?

142
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:39,959
Yes, Your Majesty, but I will be
the bravest I've ever been.

143
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,291
So the knight set off.

144
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,500
Goodnight, Polly.

145
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:49,458
Rahh!
Rahh!

146
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:50,500
Yeah!

147
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,041
Sausage dragon!

148
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,458
I command you to free
the king's daughter!

149
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:57,709
Never!

150
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,125
I'll eat her now!

151
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,083
Hey.
Use this instead.

152
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,875
It looks more like a daughter.

153
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,041
-Okay.
-Rahh!

154
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,709
Put her down!

155
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,333
You can't stop me!

156
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,959
So the knight
fought the sausage dragon

157
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,125
with all his might.

158
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,291
Rrr!

159
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,750
-Rahh!
-Yeah!

160
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,667
And the brave knight
won...

161
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,166
Aah!

162
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,458
...and rescued
the king's daughter.

163
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,083
You're safe now.

164
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:29,083
But the brave
knight was hurt very bad.

165
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,333
I need to get
to a hostable.

166
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:33,667
Oh!
There's one over there.

167
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,750
Thanks.

168
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,709
Hello,
doctor ladies.

169
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,417
Do you sell crutches?

170
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,166
Aah!

171
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,625
Ohhh!

172
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,083
Let's play Knights and Dragons!

173
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,125
Yeah!

174
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,583
Good boy, Rusty.

175
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,208
Rusty, let's play Mums and Dads.

176
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,458
Okay.
