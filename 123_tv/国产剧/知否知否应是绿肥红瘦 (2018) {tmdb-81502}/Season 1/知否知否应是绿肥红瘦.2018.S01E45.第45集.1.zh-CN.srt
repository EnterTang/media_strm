00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,429
I'm Duncan mainland and this is

2
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,638
snowboard addiction today we're going to

3
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:23,097
work on euro carbs

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,109
euro carbs are a really fun maneuver to

5
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:28,320
do on the hill and they're guaranteed to

6
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,969
up your sex appeal by at least 10% no

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,800
matter where you go if you do a euro

8
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,667
carve people are going to stop and have

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,800
a look at what you're up to

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,799
ideally the terrain you're looking for

11
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,749
to Euro carve is smooth evenly groomed

12
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,419
terrain it's really hard to do it in

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,780
powder or anywhere that it's lumpy bumpy

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,599
or full of little rocks a euro carve is

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,940
essentially a toeside carve turn where

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,308
your chest is as low to the ground as

17
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,288
you can get it so before you start your

18
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:57,718
carving you should have a pretty firm

19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,599
grasp on how to carve on your heel side

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,029
and your toe side to start working your

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,978
way towards the euro carve start just

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,009
getting as low as you can on your normal

23
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:09,569
everyday carve turn by getting lower and

24
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:11,489
lower it's going to get you in the

25
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,009
position you need to really lock into

26
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:16,109
that euro carve as you get lower and

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,899
lower start putting your back hand out

28
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,819
and touching the ground it's also a good

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,408
idea start pushing your knees forward

30
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:24,629
and seeing how close you can get your

31
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,269
knees to the ground as you start feeling

32
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:29,669
comfortable with this lower carve style

33
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:32,698
see if you can grab on to your heel edge

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,408
with your front hand by grabbing on to

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,240
your heel edge with your front hand it

36
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,609
puts you right in that position you need

37
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,529
to jump into the euro carve when you're

38
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:42,269
ready to really lock into that euro car

39
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,299
you're actually going to be throwing

40
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,797
your body weight down the hill learning

41
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,199
