1
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:07,291
Mum!

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,041
Dad!

3
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:18,750
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,959
- Bluey!

5
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,500
-Home!
-Home!

6
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,583
Ahhh.

7
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:33,583
What a day!

8
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,875
Cut us down, kids.

9
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:38,542
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

10
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,458
-Chop, chop, chop!
-Chop, chop, chop!

11
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:42,542
-Timber!

12
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:46,959
Five minutes till bed, kids.

13
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:51,125
And five <i>years </i>till the
next trip to Crazyworld.

14
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,667
Can we play a game?

15
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,000
As long as it's one
where I don't have to move

16
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,000
any part of my body or say anything
with my mouth.

17
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay.

18
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,125
Hey, Bingo!
Let's make it that

19
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,333
Mum and Dad are a mountain!

20
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:03,417
Yeah!

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,458
Mount Mumandad!

22
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:09,625
<i>This episode of</i>
Bluey <i>is called </i>Mount Mumandad.

23
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:12,291
We can have a race to the top!

24
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,417
Whoever plants their
flag first wins.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,166
Ready?

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,500
Go!

27
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,417
Wait!
I'm gonna get climbing stuff.

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,166
Bingo, we only have five minutes!

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,667
Don't start without me!

30
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,417
All packed.

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,542
Ready, set, go!

32
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,583
Wait! I forgot the music box.

33
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,834
Bingo!

34
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,834
That's it, I'm starting.

35
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,166
Ready!

36
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,542
Hey, you didn't wait for me.

37
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,458
You were taking ages!

38
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:59,417
I was packing important mountain stuff.

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,166
Grr!

40
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,667
Ooh!

41
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,375
Aaah!

42
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,792
Eeeh. This is hard!

43
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:10,375
Your backpack's too heavy,
that's why!

44
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,083
But it's got
all my climbing stuff

45
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,208
and my map
of Mount Mumandad.

46
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,333
Hmm.

47
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:21,166
Yes, I'm going the right way.

48
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,333
Oh, Bingo.

49
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:27,291
Oooh! This is a nice view.

50
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,625
Eww!

51
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:32,333
This bit of the mountain stinks.

52
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:33,917
I'm gonna win, Bingo!

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,125
Click, photo, click, photo...

54
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,583
Bingo, what are you doing?

55
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,250
We're racing!

56
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,542
Click, photo.
Ooh, yeah! Hee hee!

57
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:47,375
Ooh, this is gonna be a bit tricky.

58
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,000
-Aaah!
-Ohh!

59
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,041
Aaaaaaaah!
Ohh!

60
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,166
Help! I'm slipping!

61
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,834
I can't hold on!

62
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,125
Help, Bingo!

63
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,333
I'm coming!

64
00:02:57,417 --> 00:03:00,208
Don't worry!
I've got some rope in my backpack.

65
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,166
Grab on!

66
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,625
Ooh!

67
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,083
I got you, Bluey! Hold on!

68
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,083
Ohh, ohh!

69
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,542
Phew! Thanks, Bingo.

70
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,583
That's okay.

71
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,375
But I'm still gonna win!

72
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,417
Huh!

73
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Bluey!

74
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,542
-Yaah! Ooof!

75
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,250
Ooh, it's steep here.

76
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,208
Eeek!
So slippery!

77
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,291
Bingo, can I just use your head

78
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,500
to give me a little boost?

79
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,166
-Hey!
- Aah!

80
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,625
Oop! Sorry!

81
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:35,000
Oof. Bluey!

82
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,750
I'm gonna win, Bingo!

83
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:38,083
It's not fair, Bluey!

84
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,542
You cheated!

85
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,750
No, I didn't!

86
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,709
Yes... you... did!

87
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:44,583
No... I... didn't!

88
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,500
Yes... you... did!

89
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,083
No... I...

90
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,333
didn't!

91
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:50,542
Aah!

92
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,083
-Ehh! Ohh!

93
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,208
Uh-oh.
Aaaah!

94
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,083
Dad, stop it!

95
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,583
Oh, no! It's an avalanche!

96
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:02,458
Grooowwww!
Grr!

97
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,500
Grr!

98
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,583
-Grr!
-Aaaah!

99
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:06,625
Ooof!

100
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,333
Are you okay, Bluey?

101
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,041
I'm fine.

102
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,458
A silly little
avalanche isn't gonna stop me.

103
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,583
Aah! Bluey, there's the storm!

104
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:23,583
Dad, stop it!

105
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,542
Bluey, come back down.

106
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,041
It's not worth it.

107
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,166
No, I'm almost there!

108
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,375
Aaaah!

109
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,000
Ooof!

110
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,583
Bluey, come in my tent.

111
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,583
No, I have to get to the top!

112
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,583
But the storm is too strong.

113
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,417
Aaaah! Oof!

114
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,875
Dad!

115
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,959
Aaaah!
Aaaaah!

116
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,291
What a cheeky Old Man Mountain.

117
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,125
Ooh, I like your tent, Bingo.

118
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,208
Thanks.

119
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,166
Oh, you'll need this.

120
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,500
Ooh, that's better.

121
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,291
Nice and toasty.

122
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,417
We can play London Snap
till the storm passes.

123
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,375
Okay.

124
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,500
Black cab.

125
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,583
Trafalgar.

126
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,500
Furry hat guy.

127
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,083
Buckingham Palace.

128
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,291
Buckingham Palace.

129
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,250
-Snap!
- Ow!

130
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:19,041
And then rabbit ran off really fast,

131
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,291
leaving behind the slow tortoise.

132
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,583
Hurry up, tortoise!

133
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,333
Yeah, hurry up!

134
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:27,667
You have to beat that cheeky rabbit!

135
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,333
The storm's still going.

136
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,709
What should we do?

137
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:37,542
We'll have to stay in the tent longer.

138
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,458
We can watch the ballerina spin around.

139
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,542
I'm sorry I cheated, Bingo.

140
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,166
That's okay.

141
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,125
I'm a cheeky rabbit sometimes.

142
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,291
I think I'm more like the slow tortoise.

143
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,875
Bingo, I think the storm is stopping!

144
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,250
The mountain's quiet.

145
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,458
Come on.
Let's go!

146
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,166
Okay!

147
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,625
Shhh!

148
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:27,458
We don't want to disturb Old Man Mountain.

149
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:37,208
You do not climb Mount Mumandad
by trying to race ahead on your own,

150
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:41,333
or by competing with your comrades.

151
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:47,166
You do it slowly and carefully by
unselfish teamwork.

152
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,375
<i>That </i>is the mountain way.

153
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,208
- Ow!
