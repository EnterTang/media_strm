00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,190
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,940
Episode 44

3
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,550
- Please.
- Thank you, Momo.

4
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,510
Thank you, Momo.

5
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,280
Good wine.

6
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,260
Momo,You are too polite.

7
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,320
You are decreasing our blessings.
You are the nurse of Master,

8
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,630
and even a  Momo with high status,

9
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,620
yet you're still  invites us to drink
,I really feel so embarrassed.

10
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,370
Isn't that right?

11
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,910
What position?

12
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:40,520
Young Master Ye and I have never put any
importance to those seniority rules.

13
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,700
You can say so, but we're still
working for the inner courtyard.

14
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,324
No matter how good
Master is, he can't

15
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:52,310
really care about us.
Above us is Big Madam.

16
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,460
Big Madam isn't as resolute as Master.

17
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,860
Look at how chaotic that
kitchen has become.

18
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,600
- She doesn't even ask about it.
- Indeed.

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,810
Today, Rong'er insisted on eating
the back meat of a swamp eel.

20
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,590
I then went to the kitchen
to ask if there's any.

21
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,880
I haven't entered and I've already
heard Nanny Lai inside talking.

22
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,890
Her words were really unbearable.

23
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,860
Even my mother in the province would
feel embarrassed if she heard it.

24
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,677
And this person even
came from the attending

25
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:24,890
the Big Madam of
the marquis house.

26
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,597
She claims that she's a person
who has attended to Big

27
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,280
Madam of the marquis house,
but I don't think so.

28
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,780
Those dowry servants that Big Madam
brought with her from Qin Manor

29
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,710
were  mostly gone or dead.

30
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,460
Only Nanny Xiang is left by her side.

31
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,390
I really am puzzled. What
could be the background

32
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,130
of this Nanny Lai?

33
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,660
So barbaric.

34
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,010
I heard that...

35
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,450
...she entered with Nanny Xiang's help.

36
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,780
Because she has served longer than us,
hence, she was able to look so decent.

37
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,100
She kept showing off that she's
a trusted aide of Big Madam.

38
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,960
What's there to be proud about that?

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,480
In my opinion, you two
are not worse than her.

40
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,490
Why must you two get stepped by her?

41
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,226
We work for the fourth and
fifth house, who are not

42
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:25,620
as prestigious as the Big
Madam of the main house.

43
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,490
Talking about that, do you know that
before going to his western expedition,

44
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,790
do you know how Young Master was
able to become a general overnight?

45
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,660
Wasn't it because he was meritorious
for saving the emperor?

46
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,450
The current emperor was still
a submerged dragon then.

47
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,200
Afterwards, there was a palace
siege to usurp the throne.

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,400
It was Young Master who risked
his life to escort His Majesty,

49
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,290
and fought all out against the rebels,

50
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,650
hence, he has his current prestige.

51
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,830
If that time, Young Master
was afraid of dying

52
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,230
and just hid in Yuzhou
to preserve his life,

53
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,950
can he have achieved success? Can he have
this enormous wealth and high status now?

54
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,240
Then what Momo means is...

55
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,730
Every time a new emperor ascends,
the subjects are changed.

56
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,750
If you two can unite to
pull down that Nanny Lai,

57
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,710
remove the eye sore of Big Madam,

58
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,400
will she treat you two unfairly?

59
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,572
You two are quite cowardly.
Whether you do it

60
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:42,610
or not, I'm still the
nanny of our master.

61
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,070
Who in this house can have
a position higher than me?

62
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,480
You won't listen to the good words I say.

63
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,350
When bandits join a group, they first
must show their loyalty and devotion.

64
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,820
Fine. You two are indeed just suitable
to drink wine in this garden,

65
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,410
and unable to enter the main house.

66
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,960
Momo said it right.

67
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,160
Yes, Momo, we will remember your words.

68
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,060
Come, Momo, let me give you a toast.

69
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,920
I caught something!

70
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,990
I've caught it! I've caught it!

71
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,320
Let me do it.

72
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,760
After catching so many, we'll have
something to eat with wines tonight.

73
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,980
Since I came here to the capital with
Older Sister and Brother-in-law,

74
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,430
this is my happiest day.

75
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,490
No need to restrain my face and
consider the opinion of those elders.

76
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,945
I also don't need to keep myself
from moving my head when walking,

77
00:06:08,957 --> 00:06:11,240
or showing my teeth when laughing,
as if I'm some demure lady.

78
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,230
Come here often then.

79
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,840
You're the only one left that doesn't mind
me being wild. In this Bianjing City,

80
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,620
which rich daughter isn't being
courteous with me upfront,

81
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,040
but mocking me as a country
bumpkin behind my back?

82
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,720
Don't even talk about fishing,

83
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,300
just talking a bit louder and
they will already laugh at me.

84
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,520
Sometimes, I didn't even know
that they were laughing at me.

85
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,830
I even laughed with them.

86
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,170
You're also laughing at me?

87
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,890
The two of us can get along well. You and
a cousin of mine in our home province

88
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,580
are of similar age and personality.

89
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,030
She is also wild when she plays and runs.

90
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,975
She can climb trees to get
bird's eggs or dive into

91
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:01,660
the river to catch toads.
She can do all those.

92
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,170
In our home province, she's the person
that I'm able to get along with the most.

93
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,010
Once she comes to visit me,
I'll tell her to play with you.

94
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,730
This capital is almost
killing me from suffocation.

95
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,990
Don't know if I can still live
until your cousin arrives.

96
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,050
It's indeed a good thing that
brother-in-law of mine became the emperor.

97
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,740
But it feels like shackles
have been placed on me.

98
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,200
If I make any mistake,

99
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,890
I would be bringing trouble
to my whole family.

100
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,850
Aristocratic families are indeed like that.

101
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,390
They are deeply entangled. One committing
a mistake will affect everyone else.

102
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,100
Good thing, you were married
into the Zheng Family.

103
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,170
Your in-laws are all from reputable
families. As days pass by,

104
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,483
everyone will know that
you have a pure and kind

105
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:45,630
temperament. They will
eventually accept you.

106
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,550
Xiaotao, take these fishes to the kitchen.

107
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,040
Let's stop fishing and just go around.

108
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,630
We haven't been to a huge
half of this garden yet.

109
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,300
Sure!

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,370
In this kitchen, I'm the
one in-charge after all.

111
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,280
I'm just getting a few of these
rotten leafy vegetables.

112
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,840
Must you comment so much?

113
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,750
Rotten leafy vegetables?

114
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,120
All these were each raised and cared for
by idle people like us in the garden.

115
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,150
They are for the Miss Rong's soup.

116
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,610
Just for saying that it's a rotten leafy
vegetable, you want to take it away?

117
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,810
Are you more precious than our Miss?

118
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,750
I... Isn't it just a few wild vegetable?

119
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,670
If I ate yours, I'll just
get you some to make it up.

120
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,770
Must you make a big issue out of it?

121
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,580
Say, just for a few leafy vegetables,
just let this matter go.

122
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,420
- Stop fighting.
- Make it up?!

123
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,550
If Big Madam asks, how would I explain it?

124
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,200
You know very clearly that this is not
about just a few wild vegetables.

125
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,960
Since you got in-charge of the kitchen, how
many items have been converted to silver

126
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
and entered your pocket. Can
you explain those clearly?!

127
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,440
You...stop using Big Madam to oppress me!

128
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,700
I didn't eat yours or spent your
money, so why are you being hurt?

129
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,860
I think that you're just jealous
because other are getting kickbacks

130
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,560
while you're not.

131
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,137
Getting agitated about it.

132
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,620
You've already gotten advantage
and you still pretend to be nice?!

133
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,055
I'll hit you until you die!
Do you believe that?!

134
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:07,150
What are you doing?!

135
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,020
You people want to beat me up?! Hit
her until she dies! Get out! Leave!

136
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,820
Stinky brat! Get lost!

137
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,330
You are really so bold! You!

138
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,820
Stop! Stop!

139
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,130
- I'm indeed hitting you!
- Stop!

140
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,130
- Stop pulling me!
- Let go of me!

141
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,670
Did a thief enter your house?

142
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,070
No. It must be the senior
kitchen maids fighting again.

143
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,920
Forget it. Let's look for a
more peaceful place to talk.

144
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,710
No, they are breaking things now.

145
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,560
Sister, you're not intervening?

146
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,380
I'll kill you!

147
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,460
You stinky brat!

148
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,740
I'll kill you!

149
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,040
Young Master! Young Master!
We have trouble!

150
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,350
The people inside the inner
courtyard kitchen are fighting.

151
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,960
What has happened?

152
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,530
I heard that it's about
some wild vegetables.

153
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,920
Nanny Lai, Nanny Hua, Nanny Tian,
and a few more maidservants

154
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,970
are all fighting in there!

155
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,090
Why are you telling me these?

156
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,340
Must I still meddle with those
trifle matters in the kitchen?

157
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,280
Where's Big Madam? Tell her to
go over there and take a look.

158
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,830
Big Madam doesn't dare to meddle.

159
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,470
She said that those are nannies sent
by the elders of the marquis house.

160
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,390
Then...just forget it.

161
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,420
Is everything still okay?

162
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,710
It's fine, General.

163
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,620
You better just go over and take a look.

164
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,650
What's there to look at?

165
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,290
A few elderly women fighting and I still
have to meddle? Just let them fight.

166
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,470
At most, let them trash the
kitchen and destroy its roof.

167
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,270
I'll just look for people to rebuild it.

168
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,850
Come, come, let's drink. Hey!

169
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,930
You few quickly sound the drum!

170
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,720
Okay! Okay!

171
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,000
Right. Just watching isn't fun.

172
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,970
Sounding a few drums
makes it more exciting.

173
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,060
One more time!

174
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,680
State Uncle Shen and his
little sister left happily.

175
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,440
Aren't you afraid that
Shen lady will gossip

176
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,612
how we are not strict
in managing our house?

177
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:44,710
That the maidservants
here fight every day?

178
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,170
Making this place more lively
than the southern operas.

179
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,400
I just fear that she

180
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,450
might go defend me and argue with
others because we got along so well.

181
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,310
That's harder to handle.

182
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,230
Why?

183
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,890
She and I are both from low background.

184
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,394
It's only because of
accidental fate that we're

185
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:09,670
able to climb up a
higher social status.

186
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,480
Those people from illustrious aristocratic
families will surely not believe her words.

187
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,840
They will think that she's being
biased with her same kind.

188
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,690
Don't worry. One day, I will let those
people not dare look down on you.

189
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,920
Since they have come, we
should make them comfortable.

190
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,330
Outside, you've already given
me enough splendor and dignity.

191
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,710
For this small matter inside the house,

192
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,450
just let me deal with with it alone.

193
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,712
To resist foreign
aggression, pacify internal

194
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:44,750
conflicts first. Once
the house is clean,

195
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,240
our reputation outside
once our house is clean.

196
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,460
The days are long. No need to rush.

197
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,070
On a more serious note,

198
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,550
shouldn't you disperse the
maidservants outside now?

199
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,680
Danju,

200
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,660
go out and spread my word.

201
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,860
Big Madam instructed

202
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,360
that all people involved in the fight can't
be allowed to stay in the manor anymore.

203
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,900
Considering that you all are old
servants of the marquis manor,

204
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,420
it's also not convenient for
us to just expel you all out.

205
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,590
Tomorrow, all are being transferred
to the farmstead outside the city.

206
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,830
Miss Cuiwei, we were seeking
justice for Big Madam

207
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,513
that's why we turned hostile
against that Lai woman!

208
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:45,090
That's right!

209
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,320
We were seeking justice!

210
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,830
Even if you are, you could
have reasoned out properly.

211
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,000
Why must you become violent?

212
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,100
You all say that you were
seeking justice for Big Madam.

213
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,540
So this matter has become the
mistake of Big Madam then?

214
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,860
Tomorrow, if you kill a person,

215
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,080
will you be claiming that you're
seeking justice for general then?

216
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,840
What should we do?

217
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,320
Nanny, how's your injuries?
Do they still hurt?

218
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,340
With my old skin and face, I'm fine.

219
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,620
I'm just afraid that Big Madam
has gotten so mad about this.

220
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,940
Nanny, don't worry. Big Madam has already
punished the people who have hurt you.

221
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,093
She had them get transferred
to the farmstead

222
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:47,800
outside the city to
do manual labor.

223
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,560
Those evil whores,

224
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,520
they really dared to cruelly hit me.

225
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,390
Big Madam is right to handle them that way.

226
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:07,050
But, with so many people leaving,
the manor will surely lack people.

227
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,040
Tomorrow, I must take care

228
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,350
getting some new people in.

229
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,430
Big Madam said that since you're hurt,

230
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,430
don't worry about the
household matters anymore.

231
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,920
Tonight, you'll be transferred to
the farmstead outside the city.

232
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,298
You just need to be at
ease and recuperate.

233
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,700
No need for you to worry
about other things.

234
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,730
No! No! My injuries aren't serious.

235
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,400
When Big Madam gave the instructions,
Master was also there.

236
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,760
He then sent out his two
servants to escort you.

237
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
Nanny, stop being courteous.

238
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,400
Whether you leave now or
later, you're still leaving.

239
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,540
You people are all loyal ones.

240
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,000
With Nanny Lai and the others leaving,

241
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,010
the positions emptied is also
making me be at my wits' end.

242
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,300
Everyone, please do your best to do them.

243
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,540
Madam, don't worry. We always give
it our best in doing our tasks.

244
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,390
What marquis manor? We don't
acknowledge it at all.

245
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,040
In our eyes, there's only Big Madam.

246
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,810
We'll only listen to your orders.

247
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,240
I have to rely on everyone then.

248
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,400
You... If you want to do a good
hairstyle on your daughter,

249
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,930
you should at least follow the norms.

250
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,040
Why did you make her look like some lion?

251
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,080
Look. Put on some hair oil,

252
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,360
then turn it like this. Isn't it done?

253
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,320
So pretty.

254
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,990
Wife's fingers are like softstem bulrush,

255
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,920
so fine and long.

256
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,700
My fingers are like ginseng. How could
I beat you in doing a hairstyle?

257
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,240
Not true.

258
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,150
There's an old maidservant in our house

259
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,720
whose 10 fingers are so coarse
and short like carrots.

260
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,700
But it's her who can do
hairstyles the best.

261
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,340
She's able to do the best
and latest hairstyles.

262
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,130
Hence, this has nothing to do with
the coarseness of one's fingers.

263
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,160
If you want to do a great hairstyle,
you should practice more.

264
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,430
Don't blame the fingers.

265
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,670
So pretty.

266
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,920
Okay. Okay. I'll practice more.

267
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,350
I'm preparing to practice
on my wife's hair.

268
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,630
Don't!  Don't! Stop it!

269
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,700
You're not even saving
me and still laughing?!

270
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,010
- Don't save her!
- Save me!

271
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,580
- Get lost.
- Miss.

272
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,300
Stop it already!

273
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,420
That... I'm teaching your Big
Madam some defense moves.

274
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,140
Then...I'll just come back later.

275
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,800
Wait! Wait!

276
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,430
- What is it?
- Big Madam from the marquis manor is here.

277
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,480
She's here to denounce me for my crimes.

278
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,980
Serve her tea first. I'll be right there.

279
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,270
Yes.

280
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,120
You go first. I'll then hide

281
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,060
and listen to what you two are saying.

282
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,190
If they bully you,

283
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,460
I'll come out and give you support.

284
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,250
You better just think about
how to fix her hair.

285
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,790
You decide on where to put those.

286
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,830
Hurry up!

287
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,280
This...how do you do this?

288
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,380
Nanny Lai is old and gravely injured,

289
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,736
I was afraid that she can't
stand staying idle here

290
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:21,980
in our house and refuse
to focus on recuperating.

291
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,960
Hence, I made the decision to transfer
her to the farmstead outside the city.

292
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,200
They are really so bold to disobey!

293
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,820
Nannies Lai, Diao, Hua, and
Tian are all behaved people

294
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,610
when they were still in the marquis manor.

295
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,620
How come upon coming here to your house,

296
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,530
they ended up this way?

297
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,940
Quickly sit down, my good child.

298
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,089
Maybe because in the marquis
manor, you're there

299
00:20:49,101 --> 00:20:50,830
personally attending to
the household affairs,

300
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,100
they dare not do any mischief.

301
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,670
Upon coming here, seeing how I am young

302
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,460
and have such small might, I'm
unable to control my servants.

303
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,520
They instead went mad.

304
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,840
It's all their fault. How can
it be mother-in-law's fault?

305
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,847
From now on, I still
must learn more

306
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:09,370
principles of managing
the household from you.

307
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,540
Good thing, among the people I've sent you,

308
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,250
there were still a few that's useful.

309
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,560
I've already asked around
when I've arrived.

310
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,790
That..one named Mingyue

311
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,020
and another one named Ruyue

312
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,640
didn't join the fight.

313
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,889
Especially that Mingyue,
when she learned

314
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:31,270
that mother did that,
she tried to stop her.

315
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,830
But saying didn't work.

316
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,220
This child, in terms of
looks and needlework,

317
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,210
she's really good. She's
also a very prudent person.

318
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,460
I think that she would be helpful to you.

319
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,850
Mother-in-law is right. This
maidservant is indeed not bad

320
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,410
and I know her background very well.
She surely will be a good help.

321
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,480
I'm at ease for you saying that.

322
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,960
If these maidservants do
anything inappropriate,

323
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,100
just have people tell me.

324
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,860
You are too shy. You aren't bold
enough to be hostile with them.

325
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,750
I'll deal with them for you.

326
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,750
With mother-in-law's
words, I feel so at ease.

327
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,290
- Have caused you to worry, mother-in-law.
- No such thing.

328
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:20,666
You've just moved in here. There are still a lot of things
that you must handle in this house. You just go back now.

329
00:22:20,678 --> 00:22:22,140
Okay.

330
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,340
- Go back.
- Mother-in-law, take care.

331
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,210
Quickly go back.

332
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,510
Let's go.

333
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,360
That illegitimate daughter
is really formidable.

334
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,580
Ten plus people entered,

335
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,220
and now, only two are left.

336
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,000
It's good too that there were two left.

337
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,730
Although Mingyue and Ruyue
are not that pretty,

338
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,800
that Second grew up in
the alleys of brothels.

339
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,380
He likes having someone new.

340
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,980
Even if he can endure it now,
can he still do in the future?

341
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,870
Too bad, Nanny Lai and those others

342
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,970
who were trusted aides of ours
that we trained for decades

343
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,830
would actually end up in failure.

344
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,550
The future days are long.

345
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:31,200
This game of chess has
just reached the middle.

346
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,250
Daddy, I want to write
by my own, by my own.

347
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,550
Okay. Okay. Rong'er can
write it by herself.

348
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,860
What are you laughing at?

349
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,240
You can't kick out those two
remaining maidservants?

350
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,350
Yes. That person already left her words.

351
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,570
Even if those two make any
mistakes, I must first inform her.

352
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,910
If I kick them out, that's
turning one's back to my elder.

353
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,250
Turning your back to your elder?

354
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,990
She still has the nerve to
call herself your elder?

355
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,770
Anyway, I've turned my back against her
not just this once. I'll go talk to her!

356
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,660
No need to trouble you.

357
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,630
Wife still has some countermeasures?

358
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,950
As the main madam of this house, you think
it will be hard for me to drive people out?

359
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:38,910
The only hard part is not to let others
catch any flaws. I must make it reasonable.

360
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,590
Don't you people who fight wars

361
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,620
also pay attention to
winning without fighting?

362
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,760
These next few days, the
weather will be colder.

363
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,470
I'll then tell those two ladies

364
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,280
to go to Heishui (Blackwater)
Farmstead and visit Nanny Lai.

365
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,210
In handling the household, wife
is even using the art of war.

366
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,440
Did I just marry a Zifang (courtesy name
of Zhang Liang, a great strategist) ?

367
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,020
[ Sunset along the long river... ]

368
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,330
It's really too cold here.

369
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,960
There aren't even things that
can warm your hands and feet.

370
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,820
I really can't stay here anymore.

371
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:27,620
Didn't the marquis house ask
you to relay me a message?

372
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,340
They don't mind me that much now.

373
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,970
They would only sometimes
tell me to do my work well.

374
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:41,340
Whether I'll be able to get a concubine
position will depend on my ability.

375
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:48,130
No matter how fierce master is, I must
think of a way to make him like me.

376
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:53,200
Looks like Big Madam has
completely forgotten about me.

377
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,000
Mother. In the Cheng Garden now,
only me and Ruyue were left

378
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,680
in the group that came
from the marquis house.

379
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,980
We are outnumbered. Those people
who were nice to us before

380
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,060
are afraid of getting implicated and
don't usually socialize with us.

381
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,160
People like us who lacks foundation

382
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,860
can't even get near in front of the Master.

383
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:26,740
Child, do you want to take a step higher

384
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,160
and become the concubine of master?

385
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,030
I initially liked to,

386
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,630
but that was in the courtyard
of Young Master Wei.

387
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,050
Young Master Wei is easygoing
and easy to amuse.

388
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,480
But the current master...

389
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,470
Master is too fierce. I'm afraid.

390
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,670
Looks like the two of us are not
people who can do great undertakings.

391
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,530
That Big Madam saw that I'm now useless,

392
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,610
so she just threw me on the side
and didn't even show any care.

393
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:04,990
I've worked hard for her. It's
fine if they were honorable tasks,

394
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,370
but they were shameful deeds.

395
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,440
She will never care about our lives.

396
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,410
Mother, what should we do then?

397
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,900
That one in marquis manor is a
person who keeps her words.

398
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,010
If I don't follow her
instructions to seduce master,

399
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,590
she'll never let me off.

400
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:31,270
Child, go and beg the current main madam.

401
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,290
I beg Big Madam to give me a path to live.

402
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,340
Don't be afraid. I won't eat you.

403
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,890
If my husband really likes
you, I can't really stop it.

404
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:51,750
No! No! I don't have such intentions.

405
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:57,690
It's just that Big Madam
Qin...she forced me to do so!

406
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,070
I don't want to,

407
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:04,080
but I'm afraid. I'm afraid...

408
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,800
Afraid of what?

409
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,820
I'm afraid that she'll kick me out.

410
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,290
What do you want me to do then?

411
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,180
I want to leave this place.

412
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,230
I want to take my mother, Nanny Lai,

413
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,150
and little sister Ruyue

414
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,288
to leave Bianjing together,
and just go back

415
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,450
to our home province
Qizhou to live our days.

416
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,630
I beg Big Madam to get my slave contract.

417
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,960
You have really thought
about it very clearly.

418
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:43,530
If there's a survival path, who would
dare charge into the gates of death?

419
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,280
I beg Big Madam to be merciful.

420
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,920
You people are so broad-minded.

421
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,200
How sure are you that I can get
your slave contract back for you?

422
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:02,400
Big Madam, the three of us were old
servants of the adjacent house.

423
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,060
If the three of us leave,

424
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,770
the remaining ones will also just be a
loose pile of sand. (lose a leader)

425
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,730
Whether Big Madam kicks them out

426
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,800
or be considerate and makes them stay,

427
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,550
they will never be able to
create any trouble anymore.

428
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,510
This is good for our family,

429
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,220
and also to your family.

430
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,863
If you're this clever
from the start, how could

431
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,690
there still be so much
problems afterwards?

432
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,820
Sometimes, if you don't try it first,

433
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,080
you will never know which gate is for
survival and which will lead you to death.

434
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,030
Big Madam.

435
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:44,420
There are three of us in my family. Our
lives are in someone else's hands.

436
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,320
I was forced to do it.

437
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,470
I'm begging Big Madam to be kind.

438
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,930
Enough. You all can leave.

439
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,220
Thank you, Big Madam.

440
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,390
This meat is delicious too.

441
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,190
Try it now.

442
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,810
Now that the three of them have
left, it clean and peaceful now.

443
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:02,580
I finally have time to spare in
supervising the house and the farmsteads.

444
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,100
And that farmstead that was
granted to you by the emperor.

445
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:14,520
After dealing with several crafty old maids
and expelling out two beautiful ones,

446
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,690
in this round, you obtained
a resounding victory.

447
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:21,260
Just do the inspection of the
farmsteads once you're happy to do it.

448
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,770
If you didn't support me from the back,

449
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,090
I wouldn't have been able to
borrow the courage to do this.

450
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,030
This merit goes to you.

451
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:40,000
You are a slick person.

452
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,190
You are humoring me to make me feel good

453
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,390
and let me be the evil guy

454
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,890
to help you with the slave contract.

455
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,450
Then...I will go instead.

456
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,230
I was only joking with you.

457
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,700
How could you regard it as real?

458
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,810
I will go. I will go after I'm done eating.

459
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,590
No need to force yourself.

460
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,320
Wait for a few more days.

461
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:18,350
If they still don't get
someone to deliver it

462
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,160
it's still not too late to go.

463
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,630
No. I'm going later. I will go.

464
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:34,000
I want to see my stepmother
fuming and can't withstand me.

465
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,020
I...I can't wait for it.

466
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,490
Alright, you go then.

467
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,560
Wife.

468
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,250
I married you so that you
can enjoy happiness.

469
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,050
If you think managing the household
is too much, you can throw it to me.

470
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,500
I want to see you having the freedom
to eat the meat like just now.

471
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,970
No matter what you want
to do, I will agree.

472
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,070
I'm a military man.

473
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,290
I can't totally guess what's on your mind.

474
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,400
You must tell me.

475
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,420
Why are you suddenly saying this?

476
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,810
I'm a man of my word. I surely
will fulfill my promise.

477
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,400
Do you believe me?

478
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,120
I do.

479
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,430
Really?

480
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,140
It's true.

481
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,810
Master, people from
Shitou's family is here.

482
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,240
They said they had something
urgent to report.

483
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,760
I bumped into them when
we were docked on land.

484
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,486
The more I looked at
her, the more I find her

485
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:52,010
similar to the
illustration you gave me.

486
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,293
I thought of asking them to
settle down there first, then

487
00:33:54,305 --> 00:33:56,520
asked my husband to come back
here and report it to you.

488
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,200
But didn't know how, she
saw through my plan.

489
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,670
When the boat docked, she immediately
took the child and escaped.

490
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,255
My husband immediately went
down the boat to chase after

491
00:34:04,267 --> 00:34:06,500
them, but he lost them
when they turned a corner.

492
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,900
If there will be news about them next
time, be sure to be more careful.

493
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,860
Even if you have to look for 7 to 8
big men to surround and tie her up.

494
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:24,430
Yes. Brother Bai, we didn't handle
your matter well this time.

495
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,690
Really so sorry.

496
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,200
Not really. This woman is too cunning.

497
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,440
She's even more cruel than a
formidable man. Even I lost to her.

498
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,790
You all were also just being cautious,
fearing that she might hurt the child.

499
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,410
I brought problems onto you.

500
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,010
After removing the sand blocking my eyes,

501
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,870
these accounting books
look more clearly too.

502
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,390
I will be able to sleep soundly tonight.

503
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,548
In the past, everyone
thinks that it's

504
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,120
dangerous for you to marry
into the Gu family.

505
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,210
Looking at how the Lord
protects you, I'm relieved.

506
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,420
Old Madam is extremely relieved too.

507
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,210
No one in this kingdom is reliable.

508
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,790
He is a good man and takes care of me.

509
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,840
This is great

510
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,660
but it's best not to place
too much hopes on him.

511
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,270
Everyone has their predicaments.

512
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:22,400
Even if you are to put your hopes,
don't make it too much and too deep.

513
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,630
The more hopes you have, the
more disappointed you will be.

514
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,900
Once there are too much disappointments,
you'll develop grudges.

515
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,472
Once you bear these grudges
all your life, you'll develop

516
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:33,800
hatred and your days will
become unbearable to live.

517
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,190
Big Madam, you don't seem to
be referring to your husband.

518
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,350
It's more like you're
talking of Master Sheng.

519
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,647
I indeed have to treat
my husband like he's

520
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:45,020
him. I have to be cautious
and conscientious.

521
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,760
Now, we're just newlywed. Of course,
he still find me interesting,

522
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,560
but it's not only for just a few months.

523
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,470
There are still many years to come.
In any case, placing hopes on him,

524
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,660
he might find the burden too heavy one day.

525
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,570
What's up?

526
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,080
My brothers in Canal Gang found
traces of Chang and his mother.

527
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,190
However, they eventually lost them.

528
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,360
It's fine. Since there were traces,

529
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,887
with the broad connections
of the Canal Gang,

530
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:30,170
they surely will be
able to find them.

531
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,330
If there's news again,

532
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,700
I might leave everything here and
personally go there to look.

533
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,690
You should. By then, I'll
pack up your luggage.

534
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,220
And then go to Yuqing Monastery

535
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,370
to burn you some incense
and pray to the gods.

536
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,550
You talked about inspecting
the farmstead earlier.

537
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,430
Actually, those farmsteads don't really
earn us a lot of money every year.

538
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,180
You don't need to put too much
attention to it. Don't tire yourself.

539
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,760
How could I not? Grandmother instructed me

540
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,720
that the assets of the family
must be supervised regularly,

541
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,360
to prevent those in-charge
in deceiving us with

542
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:23,190
their reports and oppressing
the people under them.

543
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,490
If someone dies because of
it, this is no child's play.

544
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,260
That urgent?

545
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,930
Why don't I take time off and go with you?

546
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,410
No need. Just be at ease and stay in the
military camp to train your soldiers.

547
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,450
Just leave a few capable soldiers for me.
It will be fine.

548
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,238
Those people in-charge
of the farmsteads are

549
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,810
not really killing
and looting bandits.

550
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,530
They are sufficient.

551
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:59,230
If I leave everything behind here
and go look for Chang alone,

552
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,530
Will you be unhappy?

553
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,940
In the past, Nanny Zhang asked me too.

554
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,410
I don't know why I should be unhappy.

555
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,900
I think that, in the next life,

556
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,300
I will want to be your child too.

557
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,850
Marrying you is really good karma

558
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:37,870
that I've accumulated from saving humankind
in the my previous several reincarnations.

559
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,030
You already told me this. I know.

560
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,380
Alright, take a bath now.
Don't let the water get cold.

561
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,840
I'm going to get you a set
of clothes to change into.

562
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,020
What should I do

563
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,560
to make you trust me?

564
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,910
Why are you just here now? Old Commander
Bo has been waiting for you all day.

565
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:15,770
What has happened? Did my army
fight with other people again?

566
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,570
No. His Majesty made a decree yesterday

567
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,120
that he will inspect the training
of the army these next few days.

568
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,450
The two old generals went to inform
all the different military camps

569
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,990
to organize and prepare.

570
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:32,480
Inspection? With such a major thing, how
come there were no news from Prince Huan?

571
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,170
Who knows.

572
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,650
I wanted to take a few days off to settle
some personal matters in my family.

573
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,311
I urge you not to bring
that up anymore. This is

574
00:39:41,323 --> 00:39:42,860
serious matter. It can't
be handled sloppily.

575
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,060
Can't you see that even
State Uncle is here?

576
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:34,700
I, Ba Fu, greets Big Madam.

577
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,690
Big Madam, you must be
tired from your travel.

578
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,300
The house inside has been prepared.

579
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,480
Manager Guan, you have worked hard.

580
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,530
It's getting dark soon and I
still made you wait here.

581
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,730
Big Madam is a noble person.

582
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:54,440
Having some time to spare in coming
here to visit us is our good fortune.

583
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,780
We so wanted you to come.

584
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,710
Thank you, Manager Ba.

585
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,650
Everyone, you all are tired too.
Quickly go home and rest now.

586
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,956
I'll just examine the
books tomorrow morning.

587
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:04,740
This...

588
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,540
Go now. I'm tired.

589
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,290
Thank you for understanding, Big Madam.

590
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,120
This Heishan (Black Mountain) Farmstead and
the Guyan (Ancient Stone) Farmstead behind

591
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,800
can't compare to the Xiaoyu (Little
Rain) Farmstead I brought as my dowry.

592
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,326
This is a penal farm set
up by the government.

593
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:26,810
We're also not familiar
with the people here.

594
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:30,230
Sister Cuiwei, I'm a bit scared.

595
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,800
Silly girl.

596
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,740
Have you prepared all the items that
Big Madam asked you to prepare?

597
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:45,440
She indeed was from a scholarly family.
Such bearing.

598
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,400
No matter how imposing her bearing
is, she's still just a young wife.

599
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,620
What can she know?

600
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,830
Tomorrow, we can report directly according

601
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,260
to what we discussed tomorrow.

602
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:04,230
It's a newlywedr just married		
that want to come out

603
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,920
to visit her fields and show off her might.

604
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,520
Just let her show off. This will
be over after some coaxing.
