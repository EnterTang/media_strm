I'm Carl azuz for CNN 10 where we

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,410
explain events happening around the

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,089
world thank you for watching on this

5
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:11,968
second Friday of 2018 a series of

6
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:14,548
disasters has devastated parts of

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,070
Southern California the largest wildfire

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,170
in state history flared up in early

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,210
December it was named the Thomas fire

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,100
because it started near Thomas Aquinas

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,179
College it's burned more than 280 1000

12
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:29,219
acres and it's still not completely

13
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:31,859
contained or blocked off officials

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,509
expect that to happen later this month

15
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,299
but its effects led to another problem

16
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,179
the Thomas fire burned off trees brush

17
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,670
and bushes in the area and when a storm

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,159
struck earlier this week dumping rain on

19
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,590
charred hillsides there wasn't enough

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,140
living vegetation to help keep mud

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,539
boulders and dead trees from flowing

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,119
downhill debris covered roads and

23
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:56,759
swamped buildings mudslides and flooding

24
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,929
destroyed 65 homes and damaged more than

25
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:03,210
460 others and at least 17 people were

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,250
killed though several others are still

27
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,200
missing the rain has stopped and

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,540
hundreds of first responders are working

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,459
through the debris field searching for

30
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,010
survivors deadly mudslides have struck

31
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,650
this area before its unique landscape

32
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,810
has contributed to both its beauty and

33
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,840
its potential threat from disaster The

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,728
Sun has come up and is exposing the

35
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:25,349
vastness of the devastation look at this

36
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:28,170
house behind me not only a debris field

37
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,140
of enormity with trees and parts of

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,540
other houses and so much other but it

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,819
looks like the front windows were blown

40
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:37,920
straight out of the house because in

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,950
some of these instances we had ruptured

42
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,649
gas lines and then looking just over to

43
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,500
the left this house cars sealed off

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,060
debris everywhere

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,530
trees poles all of that Montecito is

46
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,349
unique in that it goes from about 3,000

47
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,359
feet to sea level in just a few miles

48
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,909
and running up to these first rains they

49
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,920
had warned that this area that is the

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,009
Thomas fire burn area so vast the

51
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,920
largest brush fire acreage was in

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,318
California history they had feared that

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,969
they could get a big slide they had so

54
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,259
much rain here at one point

55
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,318
nearby Carpinteria in just one hour an

56
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,680
inch of rain and once those loose

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,408
hillsides were hit by this pinwheeling

58
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:27,000
storm the ashy mud just came flowing

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,180
down jumped over a creek you see yet

60
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,098
another home devastated and it came

61
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:35,280
right down a main road here there are

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,259
people who have been cut off by this

63
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,789
huge boulders trees power lines there in

64
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:43,859
the Romero Canyon neighborhood just a

65
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:46,109
little north east of me we saw heist

66
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,639
rescues as they call them yesterday

67
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,439
that's when they literally get the

68
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,030
helicopter and pull people out by

69
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,759
helicopter the US Congress is moving

70
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,829
closer to renewing a controversial law

71
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,019
that allows the government to collect

72
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,699
information about people in other

73
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:02,489
countries who aren't US citizens this is

74
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,469
part of something called FISA the

75
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,299
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act

76
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,430
which dates back to 1978

77
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,370
a component of FISA passed more recently

78
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,609
in 2008 lets US intelligence officials

79
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:16,680
gather email and text messages of

80
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,439
foreigners without a warrant but because

81
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,959
the information of American citizens can

82
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,000
also be caught up in this intelligence

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,579
gathering some privacy advocates oppose

84
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,799
the law while its supporters say it's

85
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,469
necessary to keep Americans safe these

86
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:33,419
divisions aren't strictly along party

87
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:36,209
lines most Republicans including

88
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,098
President Donald Trump support

89
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:40,620
reauthorizing the law but dozens don't

90
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,620
most Democrats don't want to reauthorize

91
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,068
the law but dozens do we say reauthorize

92
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:49,139
because this part of FISA is set to

93
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,229
expire on January 19th unless Congress

94
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:54,329
renews it and lawmakers move to step

95
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,430
closer to doing that yesterday when the

96
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,329
House of Representatives voted 256 to

97
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:02,818
164 to renew the law the House votes

98
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,530
considered a victory for the Trump

99
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,509
administration even though the president

100
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:08,939
appeared to criticize the FISA law on

101
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,098
Thursday morning he tweeted that it

102
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:13,289
might have been used to inappropriately

103
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:15,449
collect information on his presidential

104
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:17,819
campaign later in the morning President

105
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:19,649
Trump tweeted his support for the law

106
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,199
saying the vote was about quote foreign

107
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,360
surveillance of foreign bad guys on

108
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,459
foreign land

109
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:27,800
and that the u.s. needed it critics said

110
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,839
the tweets caused confusion on Capitol

111
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,120
Hill the White House denied that saying

112
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,430
President Trump supports the law and was

113
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,649
happy to see it passed in the house now

114
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:38,360
it goes to the Senate for its

115
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,699
consideration where again support and

116
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,918
opposition is not divided straight down

130
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:21,848
they've only been around since the mid

1990s the New York Public Library has

132

Alex Dunlop a reporter from the British

139
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,319
Broadcasting Corporation recently

140
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,939
learned what it was like to be swarmed

141
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:53,209
by lemurs thankfully he was at a zoo but

142
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,129
these things can still be pretty wild

143
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:57,800
Dunlop was trying to report on an animal

144
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,930
count he probably wasn't counting on the

145
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,209
highly social animals to be quite so

146
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:04,310
highly social wonder if he thought to
