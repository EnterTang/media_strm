[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,980
- We welcome our viewers
worldwide to this January

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,360
31st edition of CNN 10.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,580
I'm Carl Azuz.

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,260
And an act required by
the US Constitution played

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,940
out in America last night.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,800
Our first topic today
is the president's

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,480
State of the Union Address.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,730
The event as we know
it is not spelled out

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,410
in the US founding document.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,530
It says the president, quote,
shall, from time to time,

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,680
give to the Congress information
of the state of the union

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,330
and recommend to
their consideration

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,410
such measures as he shall
judge necessary and expedient.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,260
That's from Article II,
section II of the Constitution.

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,480
The fact that it's done
in person, the fact

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,400
that it's done as
a speech, the fact

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,140
that it's done on
television, the fact

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,630
that there is an official
response from the opposing

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,740
political party--

21
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,290
none of that is required
by the Constitution.

22
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,120
But it is tradition
dating back decades.

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,500
And so it continued last night
when US President Donald Trump

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
entered the House
of Representatives

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,610
to give his first official
State of the Union address.

26
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,420
So what topics does he judge
necessary and expedient

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,950
for Congress?

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,800
- Tonight, I call upon all of
us to set aside our differences,

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,850
to seek out common ground,
and to summon the unity we

30
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,850
need to deliver for the people.

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,220
This is really the key.

32
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,760
These are the people we
were elected to serve.

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,030
So let's begin
tonight by recognizing

34
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,960
that the state of
our union is strong

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,020
because our people are strong.

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,560
Since the election,
we have created 2.4

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,885
million new jobs, including--

38
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:52,260
[APPLAUSE]

39
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,610
Including 200,000 new jobs
in manufacturing alone.

40
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,410
Tremendous numbers.

41
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,290
[APPLAUSE]

42
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,240
After years and years
of wage stagnation,

43
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,780
we are finally
seeing rising wages.

44
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,480
We have proposed
new legislation that

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,560
will fix our immigration
laws and support our ICE

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,210
and border patrol agents.

47
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:27,490
My duty, and the sacred duty
of every elected official

48
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,570
in this chamber, is
to defend Americans,

49
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,040
to protect their
safety, their families,

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,500
their communities, and their
right to the American dream.

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,950
Because Americans
are dreamers, too.

52
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,900
As part of our defense, we
must modernize and rebuild

53
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,790
our nuclear arsenal, hopefully
never having to use it,

54
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,780
but making it so
strong and so powerful

55
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,950
that it will deter any
acts of aggression.

56
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,570
In the past, we have foolishly
released hundreds and hundreds

57
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,930
of dangerous
terrorists only to meet

58
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,470
them again on the battlefield.

59
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,500
So today, I am keeping
another promise--

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,400
to re-examine our
military detention policy

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,130
and to keep open the detention
facilities in Guantanamo Bay.

62
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,090
As long as we are
proud of who we are

63
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,520
and what we are
fighting for, there

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,880
is nothing we cannot achieve.

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,690
As long as we have
confidence in our values,

66
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:46,180
faith in our citizens, and trust
in our god, we will never fail.

67
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,820
Our families will thrive,
our people will prosper,

68
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,290
and our nation will
forever be safe and strong

69
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,860
and proud and mighty and free.

70
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,330
Thank you, and
God bless America.

71
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,860
- Another State of
the Union tradition

72
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,660
is the opposing political
party's response.

73
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,430
The first televised one of
those took place in 1966

74
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,050
after the State of
the Union address

75
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,399
by President Lyndon B Johnson.

76
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,880
He was a Democrat,
and two Republicans--

77
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,700
Senate Minority Leader
Everitt Dirksen and House

78
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,560
Minority Leader Gerald Ford--

79
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,240
recorded speeches
that were shown

80
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,010
after the president's address.

81
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,470
And so that tradition
continued last night.

82
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,750
After the speech by the
Republican president,

83
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,910
a Democratic US
representative named

84
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,640
Joe Kennedy from Massachusetts
gave his party's response.

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,630
He's the grand nephew of
President John F Kennedy,

86
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,300
and he spoke from a high
school in his state.

87
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,180
- We see an economy
that makes stocks soar,

88
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,570
investor portfolios bulge,
and corporate profits climb,

89
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,910
but fails to give workers
their fair share of the reward,

90
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,590
a government that struggles
to keep itself open,

91
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,510
Russia knee deep
in our democracy,

92
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,150
an all-out war on
environmental protection,

93
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:15,440
a Justice Department rolling
back civil rights by the day,

94
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,950
hatred and supremacy proudly
marching in our streets.

95
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,300
It would be easy to dismiss
this past year as chaos

96
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,740
and partisanship as politics.

97
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,520
But it's far, far
bigger than that.

98
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,720
This administration
isn't just targeting

99
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
the laws that protect us.

100
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,610
They're targeting
the very idea that we

101
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,400
are all worthy of protection.

102
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
have faith.

103
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,330
Have faith.

104
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,970
The state of our
union is hopeful,

105
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,740
resilient, and enduring.

106
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,220
God bless you.

107
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,720
God bless your families.

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,960
And may God bless the
United States of America.

109
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,620
NARRATOR: The 10-second trivia.

110
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,390
Which of these seasons typically
coincides with fall and winter

111
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,350
in the US?

112
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,300
Baseball season,
hurricane season,

113
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,340
flu season, or carnival season?

114
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,920
The only one of the seasons
that starts in the fall

115
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,590
and continues through
winter is the flu season.

116
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,480
- It's closed down schools
in at least 12 states.

117
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,900
It set a record for the number
of cases in New York state.

118
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,930
It's the first time in
15 years that every state

119
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,170
in the continental US has
reported widespread activity

120
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,810
during the same week.

121
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,440
And it's possible
that the current flu

122
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,490
season that's ravaging the
country hasn't even peaked yet.

123
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,340
Part of the reason is that
this year's flu vaccine appears

124
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,230
to be one of the least
effective in recent years,

125
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,680
though doctors say people
should still get it because it

126
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,200
might make the flu less severe.

127
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,500
H3N2 is the specific
strain of the virus that's

128
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,360
making so many people sick.

129
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,370
This strain usually
causes higher rates

130
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,630
of hospitalizations and deaths.

131
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,040
REPORTER: It's
always scary when you

132
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,820
hear of someone dying from
something as common as the flu.

133
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,790
There are four main ways
the flu can turn deadly.

134
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,220
The first and most common
cause is pneumonia.

135
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,580
The influenza virus can
directly cause viral pneumonia.

136
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,670
Once someone has the flu, it
can weaken their immune system

137
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,390
so much that another virus or
bacteria can enter the lungs.

138
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,660
Infected lungs fill with fluid,
making it difficult to breathe,

139
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,210
so oxygen can't get to
the rest of the body,

140
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,680
which can lead to death.

141
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,600
Sepsis is the second
way the flu can

142
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,820
become lethal, especially
in healthy younger

143
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,530
adults and children.

144
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,690
Sepsis occurs when a
person's immune system

145
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,540
goes into overdrive
trying to fight the flu.

146
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,160
This causes
inflammation, which can

147
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,740
lead to a cascade of
symptoms that ultimately

148
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,750
ends in organ failure.

149
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,760
A third way the flu can
kill is by increasing

150
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,200
your risk of heart attack.

151
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,780
Experts say in adults, risk
of heart attack increases

152
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,470
six-fold in the seven days
following a flu diagnosis.

153
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,850
The fourth way the
flu can kill is

154
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,520
by dehydration,
particularly among infants

155
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,780
and young children.

156
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,400
The flu often causes
vomiting and diarrhea,

157
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,610
which can quickly become
life-threatening if fluids

158
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,900
aren't replaced in the body.

159
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,650
So if you get the flu,
when should you be worried?

160
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,290
Some people have a higher
risk for serious complications

161
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,380
from the flu, including the
elderly, children under the age

162
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,330
of five, pregnant
women, and those

163
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,230
with chronic health problems.

164
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,650
If this is you, make
sure you see a doctor.

165
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,809
If you're a healthy
older child or adult,

166
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:39,299
watch out for sudden dizziness,
severe, persistent vomiting,

167
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,900
difficulty breathing, pain
or pressure in the chest

168
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,720
or abdomen, and flu-like
symptoms that improve,

169
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,090
then return with a
fever or worse cough.

170

[MUSIC PLAYING]

171
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,830
- A horticulturist says
the average humidity

172
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,170
in a normal office is 30%.

Average humidity here is 60%.

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,370
And it kind of needs to be.

175
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,700
What's known as The Spheres
is mostly an office space

176
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,790
for Amazon employees-- that's
Amazon, the internet company,

177
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,900
not the rainforest.

178
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,050
Although by looking at
this, it has 40,000 plants

179
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,680
and 400 different species held
together by millions of pounds

180
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,620
of steel, concrete, and glass--

181
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,350
a place where you could discuss
career and plant growth,

182
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,620
forage for new ideas, solve
problems with good reason,

183
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,120
see how many meetings
you can jungle,

184
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,300
call in tech support
to survey ecosystems,

185
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,740
bring in coworkers
for a "conifer-ence,"

186
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,020
make the tough
"decidu-isions," and foster

187
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,640
strong workplace habitat.

188
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,380
Oh, yeah, forest puns--

189
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,340
they'll grow on you.

190
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,390
I'm Carl Azuz, and
that's "CNN 10."
