1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,550
《女王》前情提要
Previously on Reign:

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,810
你见过他吗  你见过"黑暗"吗
Have you seen him? Have you seen the Darkness?

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,460
我生下来就是个异教徒
I was born a pagan.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,290
所以你才对此事这么上心吗
Is that why you've taken this on?

5
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,370
这个信仰
Because you feel some blame

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,290
让你觉得要为森林中的罪行负责吗
for the blood spilled by this faith?

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,430
别  烦我
Leave... me alone.

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,490
他就是疯了
He is mad,

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,950
一个疯了的国王会引起混乱煽动叛乱的
and a mad king incites chaos and rebellion.

10
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,900
他听了我的话
He listened to me.

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,580
他已经开始恢复理智
His sanity started trickling back in, 

12
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,110
有一瞬间  我甚至感觉到了曾经的父亲
and for a moment I could actually see my father again.

13
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,980
我得杀了我的儿子
I must kill my son

14
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,700
然后跟他妻子成婚
and wed his wife.

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,950
出什么事了
What's happening?

16
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,750
我很害怕  我不想去
I'm frightened. I don't want to go!

17
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,130
国王又发怒了吗
Is the king angry again?

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,700
怎么回事  城堡遭到攻击了吗
What's going on? Is the castle under attack?

19
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,840
国王召集所有人去庭院
The king has summoned everyone to the courtyard.

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,760
很紧急
Urgently.

21
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,280
怎么回事
What's this about?

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,680
我不知道  但恐怕是最糟糕的事
I don't know, but I fear the worst.

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,510
你们中有一个或者多个人
One or more of you here,

24
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,420
我的朋友  家人
my friends, my family...

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,710
臣民中
my subjects...

26
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,390
想杀害我
tried to kill me.

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,400
我已经采取了行动
I have taken steps.

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,890
你们见过我的新手下
You have seen my new men,

29
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,110
模仿罗马帝国的禁卫军
modeled after the Praetorian Guard of the Roman Emperors;

30
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,830
只忠于我
loyal only to me.

31
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,540
但我知道这还不够
But I knew more needed to be done.

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,020
罪人自会显现
The guilty revealed.

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,260
而今晚
And this night...

34
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,550
在梦里
in a dream...

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,130
上帝告诉了我方法
God told me how.

36
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,600
我向他发誓
My oath to him:

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,740
这把剑
this sword...

38
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,780
夺人性命之后
will not be sheathed

39
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,380
才会入鞘
till it has taken a life.

40
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,660
太阳升起时  这把剑会投射出阴影
As the sun rises, this sword will cast a shadow.

41
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,620
阴影指向谁
When that shadow touches the guilty...

42
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,080
谁就是罪人
I'll know.

43
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,470
现在不行
Not now.

44
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,860
给他们时间诉说罪孽和忏悔
Give them time to tell their sins and due penance.

45
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,580
让他们清洗干净灵魂
Let their souls be wiped clean;

46
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,700
上帝最喜欢那样
God likes that best.

47
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,940
大家都想忏悔
Everyone wants to confess.

48
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,310
这里的谁
Who here...

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,710
昨天忏悔了
made their confession yesterday?

50
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:10,960
我
I did.

51
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,520
特拉弗斯  陛下
Travers, my lord.

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
贝拉米大人的书记
Secretary to Lord Bellamy.

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,560
你昨晚和人私通了吗
Did you fornicate last night?

54
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,870
或者随便提起了上帝的名字
Or take the Lord's name in vain?

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,880
当然没有  陛下
Of course not, my lord.

56
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,550
我们都该和你一样心甘情愿
We should all be as ready as you.

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,520
解散
Be off.

58
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,830
穿上最华丽的服饰
Done your finest clothing.

59
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,830
对加来胜利的庆祝
The celebrations of our victory at Calais

60
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,860
将达到巅峰
will reach their peak.

61
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,370
弄干净了
Clean that.

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,000
我错了
I was wrong.

63
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,060
他的确疯了
He is lost.

64
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,870
女王  第一季第二十二集

65
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,780
我长这么大
All the time I was growing up,

66
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,970
一直认为他是法国最伟大的男人
I saw him as the greatest man in France.

67
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,760
很抱歉  弗朗西斯
I'm sorry, Francis.

68
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,280
现在行刺太晚了  我们没法近他的身
It's too late for assassination; we'd never get near him.

69
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,660
必须由更大的力量来推翻他的王位
He must be removed from the throne by a superior force.

70
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,960
政变吗
A coup?

71
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,540
如果我们失败了  就死定了
It's deadly for us if we lose

72
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,040
如果成功了  也很危险
and dangerous if we win.

73
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,570
政变将权力交到了军队手里
A coup puts power in the hands of the military.

74
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,780
我们别无选择
We have no choice.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,960
怎么做呢
But how? 

76
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,160
我能给将军什么  让他们支持我  而不是我父亲
What can I offer the generals to back me, rather than Father?

77
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,070
我没法比他给他们更多奖赏了
I can give them no more reward than he.

78
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,780
加来战役之前  一些将军被撤职了
Some generals were dismissed before Calais.

79
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,300
他们肯定觉得被国王背叛了
Surely, they feel betrayed by their king.

80
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,050
他们都是有领地的贵族
And each one of them is a noble with a territory

81
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,490
而且还有自己的手下
and men of their own to command.

82
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,970
可能成功
It could work.

83
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,060
但如果我们获胜
But if we win,

84
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,570
夺取了政权
if we seize power...

85
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,030
你的父亲会怎么样
what happens to your father?

86
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,520
他会被囚禁起来
He will be imprisoned,

87
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,000
看最好的医生
see the finest doctors, 

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,650
不久后  他要么会恢复正常
and in time either he will regain his senses

89
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,670
要么会自然死亡  但是...
or he will die a natural death, but...

90
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,330
他不能再做国王了
he can never be king again.

91
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,870
他的年代会终结...
His time will be over...

92
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,400
你我将共同执政
and you will rule beside me.

93
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,420
帕斯卡尔
Pascal.

94
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,760
怎么了  出什么事了
What is it, what's wrong?

95
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,420
我做噩梦了
I've had a nightmare.

96
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,700
我看见他
I saw him...

97
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,150
站在窗外  盯着我们
outside the window, staring at us.

98
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,800
瞧见了吗
You see?

99
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,730
巴斯派来的守卫在这里
The guards that Bash sent are here.

100
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,690
你很安全  那只是梦而已
You're safe. It was just a dream.

101
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,880
巴斯很快会从维斯嘉德回来
Bash will return from Visegard soon.

102
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,210
等他找到"黑暗"
And when he finds the Darkness,

103
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,450
你就再也不用害怕了
we'll make sure he never threatens you

104
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,150
别人也一样
or anyone else ever again.

105
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,020
我发现你的伤口痊愈了
Your wounds have healed, I see.

106
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,380
也没理由再窝在床上偷懒了
Well, I found no more excuses to stay in bed.

107
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,720
我还...
I also, um...

108
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,990
我发现了这个
I found this.

109
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,950
这是包括农田  果园  庄园在内的
It's a deed to lands that include farms,

110
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,530
土地地契
orchards, a manor house.

111
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,110
这叫我该怎么感谢你
How could I ever thank you?

112
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,830
我做梦到没想到...
This is more than I could have ever dreamed...

113
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,980
你救了我的命
You saved my life.

114
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,640
唯一让我后悔的是无法给你头衔
I only regret that I couldn't give you a title,

115
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,870
但只有国王有权这么做  而我父亲...
but that is the king's job and my father is...

116
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,210
现在这种黑暗时刻
These are dark hours;

117
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,260
不是让我父亲赐头衔的好时机
it is not a good time to ask for such a thing.

118
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,540
我们一定得喝一杯
We must share a drink.

119
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,120
我还有要事
I have something important to attend to.

120
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,050
下次吧
Another time?

121
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,780
对了  祝你成功娶到你说的那个姑娘
Oh, good luck with that girl that you told me about.

122
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,000
如果她不马上嫁给你  她就是个傻瓜
If she doesn't wed you now, she's a fool.

123
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,920
那杯酒是我给你拿来的
I brought you that drink.

124
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,840
你不觉得至少该对我笑一笑吗
Don't you think you owe me a smile?

125
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,400
又不是我让你拿的
I didn't ask for the drink.

126
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,650
你尽管拿回去啊
Feel free to take it back.

127
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,120
你大错特错了
You're making an enormous mistake,

128
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,170
你个婊子
you rich tart.

129
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,850
我可是国王的贴身侍卫
I am in the king's personal guard.

130
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,790
你最好对我友好一点
So you'd better start being nice to me,

131
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
-这样对你自己好...  -亲爱的
- if you know what's best... - Darling!

132
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,370
抱歉我来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

133
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,730
没关系
It's all right.

134
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,950
这位先生在陪我解闷呢
This gentleman was just keeping me amused.

135
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,820
好吧
Well...

136
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,250
美女
only the best

137
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,710
要配加来之战的英雄
for the heroes of Calais...

138
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,810
对吧
right?

139
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,160
抱歉冒昧打扰了
Sorry for intruding.

140
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,810
有人被强迫做一些不愿做的事时
I can tell when somebody's being pushed into something

141
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,130
我能看出来  这种事我见过太多
that they don't want to do; I've seen too much of it.

142
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,930
你是说在军队时吗
In the army, you mean?

143
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,230
在我的一生中
All my life.

144
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,510
跟我喝一杯  然后跟我说说吧
Have a drink with me and tell me about it.

145
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,980
我  我很愿意  但是
I... I'd love to, but, uh...

146
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,720
说实话  我  我在找人
I-- truth is, I'm-I'm looking for someone.

147
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,560
这是今天我听过的最悲伤的话了
Those are the saddest words I've heard all day.

148
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,640
陛下  我按照您的吩咐做好了
Your Majesty, I've done as you wished.

149
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,310
往王子盘子里下药的事
The matter of the additional spice to be added

150
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,640
您确定真的要这么做吗
to the Dauphin's plate, have you changed your mind?

151
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,530
确定
No.

152
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,470
今晚的晚宴上就动手
I want it done at tonight's feast.

153
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,810
不用担心犯下罪恶
Don't be concerned about the sin.

154
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,940
我已经为我们两人向上帝赎罪了
I reconciled with God for us both.

155
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,900
记住要让他的盘子里堆满肉
See his plate is piled high with meats.

156
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,040
好让别人以为弗朗西斯
To those watching, it will look as though

157
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,690
是被噎死的
Francis choked to death.

158
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,000
对了  告诉下人准备好花环
Oh! And tell them to leave up the garlands.

159
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,490
我打算在这里举办婚礼
I'm planning a wedding here...

160
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,710
就在不久的将来
in the near future.

161
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,760
如果我能说服将军们支持我
If I can sway the generals to my side,

162
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,330
我就会跟他们还有他们派的人一起返回
I shall return with them and their men beside me.

163
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,760
这样就够了吗
Will that be enough?

164
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,980
如果吉斯公爵与我们为敌...
If the Duke of Guise sets his forces against us...

165
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,000
他为人谨慎
He is a cautious man.

166
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,410
可能会等等看看是谁赢得这场...
Perhaps he'll wait to see who wins this...

167
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,150
瞧啊
Well!

168
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,710
这么美好的日子里有两对幸福的夫妻
Two happy couples on a happy day, hmm?

169
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,760
玛丽
Mary,

170
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,390
你不来看看马上长矛比武
aren't you coming to see the joust

171
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,760
还有海军的壮观表演吗
and the naval spectacle?

172
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,970
什么壮观表演
"Spectacle"?

173
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,080
两艘战船
Two ships

174
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,320
模拟战役
in mock combat.

175
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,110
绝对会是奇观
It will be a wonder.

176
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,170
而你  就是此次奇观的贵客
And you... are the guest of honor.

177
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:32,730
我
Me?

178
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,790
亨利坚持让你去看  亲爱的
Oh, Henry insists, my dear.

179
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,190
当然  这是我的荣幸
Oh, of course, I'm honored.

180
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,970
我很后悔之前跟你不怎么亲近
I regret we haven't been as close as we should.

181
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,230
可能因为你跟我儿子在一起
I may have been a bit judgmental

182
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,230
以及你跟他至今
in your behavior with my sons

183
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,840
没有子嗣的事  我对你
and about your lack of an heir...

184
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,070
有点偏见...
with Francis.

185
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,190
可事实证明
As it turns out,

186
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,780
上帝这样计划可能...
God's plan there may be...

187
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,890
是最好的选择
for the best, after all.

188
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,960
-我该走了  -你不能走
- I should go. - But, you can't.

189
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,210
你不仅是加来一战的英雄
You're not just a hero of Calais,

190
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,660
你还是战役的领导者
you led the invasion.

191
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,500
我要去探望在战役中受伤
I am looking in at some of the injured soldiers

192
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,650
今天无法到场的将士
who couldn't be here today.

193
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,700
那你今晚会回来参加晚宴的对吧
But you will be back for the feast... tonight?

194
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,690
当然
Of course.

195
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,830
走吧
Shall we?

196
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,060
进来
Come in!

197
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,950
你把盘子放到那边的桌子上就行
Could you put the tray on the table over there?

198
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,420
是行
I could,

199
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,340
但我没拿盘子
but I don't have a tray.

200
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,660
要我去拿一个来吗
Should I go find one?

201
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,800
利思
Leith.

202
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,530
谢天谢地
Thank God.

203
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,430
我听说你还活着  但是
I heard you were alive, but...

204
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,210
这是什么
What's this?

205
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,240
我的土地
My land.

206
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,680
你看看地图上
Look at the map.

207
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,350
你看看所列物品
Look at the list of holdings.

208
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,490
农田  付租金的租客
Farms, tenants paying rent!

209
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,630
河流  果园  庄园
River access, orchards, a manor house.

210
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,120
我不明白
I don't understand.

211
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,600
我是加来战役的英雄  葛瑞尔
I'm a hero of Calais, Greer.

212
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,160
我救了王子的命
I saved the Dauphin's life.

213
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,020
弗朗西斯称我为他的朋友
Francis calls me his friend.

214
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,280
太好了
This is wonderful.

215
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,630
但这...
But it...

216
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,170
并不能改变什么
it can't change anything.

217
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,070
我已经和卡斯尔雷大人订婚了
I'm engaged to Lord Castleroy.

218
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,080
什么...我现在有钱了
Wha-- I'm-I'm a rich man. 

219
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,810
你的确能为我提供舒适的生活
You are a... a comfortable man.

220
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,160
但你的财产
But this w...

221
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,460
连我父亲欠的债的十分之一都不够
would not clear a tenth of my father's debts.

222
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,920
也负担不起我妹妹们的嫁妆
It wouldn't provide my sisters with dowries.

223
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,220
我父亲会把她们卖给出价最高的人
My father would sell them to the highest bidder.

224
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,510
她们可以和我们一起生活
Well, they... well, they could live with us!

225
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,320
你不明白我们这种人的生活
You don't understand how people like us live!

226
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,340
我的妹妹们属于我的父亲
My sisters belong to my father;

227
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,780
是他的私人财产
they're his property!

228
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,150
他绝不会同意让她们搬去
He'd never agree to let them move to--

229
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,900
一个在他看来
what he'd see as some...

230
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,740
像死水一样的
...some backwater,

231
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,140
没法让她们找到合适求婚者的地方
where they would never find appropriate suitors.

232
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,300
我明白了
I get the idea.

233
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,090
请你理解
Please understand.

234
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,820
我还要去港口
I'm... due in the harbor.

235
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,890
他们想让我
They want me to...

236
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,670
和其他一些老兵一起上船  类似某种
join some other veterans on the ship; some kind of...

237
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,530
宏大的海军展示
naval spectacle.

238
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,970
看来还是有人会把今天视为庆典
Apparently, there are people who consider today a celebration.

239
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,890
我不希望我们就这样分别
I don't want to part like this!

240
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,910
葛瑞尔  某些时候  你需要停止
Greer, at some point, you have to stop piling

241
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,330
把整个家族的问题都堆在自己身上
all of your family's problems on your back.

242
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,910
你需要去冒险
You have to take a risk.

243
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,510
你需要相信爱  相信命运
You have to trust love and fate

244
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,320
相信我
and me.

245
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,880
对不起  夫人
Uh, I beg your pardon, ma'am.

246
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,100
我在驾驶马车
My carriage is in the road.

247
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,410
送一位贵妇人返回城堡时
I'm taking a noblewoman back to the castle,

248
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,160
可她突然快要分娩
and she has gone into labor.

249
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,810
夫人
Uh, my lady,

250
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,370
你该等我去接你的
you should've waited for me to get you.

251
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,590
你们干什么
Hey, what are you doing?

252
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,380
我没法帮你们
I can't help you!

253
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,480
我不是接生婆
I'm not a midwife.

254
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,720
那就去找一个来
Then send for one.

255
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,780
我会补偿给你造成的麻烦
I can reimburse you for your trouble.

256
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,230
如果这位夫人或她的孩子死在这里
What reimbursement will help me

257
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,680
我要补偿又有什么用呢
if this lady dies on my hands?

258
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,340
整个法国都将怪罪于我
Or her babe, and all of France will blame me.

259
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,680
法国国王  亨利陛下
His Majesty King Henry of France.

260
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,150
苏格兰女王  玛丽陛下
Her Majesty Mary, Queen of Scots.

261
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,550
法国王后  凯瑟琳陛下
Her Majesty Catherine, Queen of France.

262
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,210
睁大你们的眼睛  看看法国的力量吧
Turn your eyes on a display of French might.

263
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,720
这场展示是为了向加来之战的英雄们致敬
A spectacle to honor the heroes of Calais.

264
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,250
每艘船上
Each ship is full of soldiers

265
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,730
都满载着凯旋的士兵
just returned from our victory.

266
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,860
国王万岁
Long live the king!

267
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,990
等着看烟火吧
Wait till you see the fireworks.

268
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,870
愿上帝保佑你  国王陛下
God bless you, Your Majesty!

269
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,210
有什么我能为你做的吗  亲爱的
Is there anything I can get you, my dear?

270
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,390
要不要来点温暖
Some warm...

271
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,810
香甜的葡萄酒
mulled wine?

272
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,330
不用了  谢谢  我很好
No, thank you. I'm fine.

273
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,300
利思刚刚来找我了
Leith came to see me.

274
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,190
我向他表明我们之间已经结束了
I made it clear to him that we're over,

275
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,310
我会嫁给你  你是我的未来
that I'm marrying you, that you're my future.

276
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,640
能不失去我心爱的女人真让我松了一口气
You must allow me to be relieved in not losing the woman I love.

277
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,460
他们竟然让加农炮开火
They're firing cannons.

278
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,150
太奇怪了
How strange.

279
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,230
我还以为他们会放烟火
I thought they were using fireworks.

280
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,480
一定是因为
It must be safe enough,

281
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,240
只要他们不互相瞄准  就足够安全
as long as they don't point at each other.

282
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,610
加农炮可是很难控制的
Well, cannons can be hard to control.

283
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,170
这是胜利的声音
The sound of victory.

284
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,490
是法国的声音
The sound of France.

285
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,230
这难道不让你觉得兴奋吗
Doesn't that excite you?

286
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,990
天呐  利思就在其中一艘船上
My God, Leith is on one of those ships.

287
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,750
就算是没被炸成碎片的人也活不下来了
Those who aren't blown to bits won't survive.

288
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,190
-水太冷了  -我告诉过他们要小心了
- The water's freezing. - I told them to fire with care!

289
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,120
控制开火的人难道是宠物猴吗
Who's manning the guns, a pet monkey?

290
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,710
等等  你真的让他们开火了
Wait, you actually told them to fire the cannons?

291
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,560
只有烟火
What kind of spectacle

292
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,730
算得上什么宏大展示呢
would mere fireworks have been, hmm?

293
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,020
无所谓了
Well, never mind.

294
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,140
我不许你失望  玛丽
I refuse to have you disappointed, Mary.

295
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,430
这些...
This...

296
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,200
都是为你而准备的
is all for you, you know.

297
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,600
-明天还有一次机会  -明天
- There'll be another chance tomorrow. - Tomorrow?

298
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,920
明天我们会再来一次  这回一定要成功
When we'll do it again! Properly this time!

299
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,200
上百人就这么死去了
A hundred men dead like that.

300
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,900
生命被如此轻易地夺去
Life so carelessly taken.

301
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,880
感觉好像我是那个失去了理智的人一样
I feel like I'm the one losing my mind.

302
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,350
玛丽  有件事你需要知道
Mary, there's something you should know.

303
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,610
亨利再一次申请废后
Henry asked for an annulment once more.

304
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,120
这只能说明他打算结束我们的婚姻
It can only mean he wishes to end our marriage

305
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,110
另娶他人
and turn to someone else.

306
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,590
也就是你
You.

307
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:11,680
不
No.

308
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,160
我看到了他对你的所作所为
I saw what he did to you.

309
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,260
这简直是莫名其妙
That came out of nowhere.

310
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,200
他从未对我表现出丁点兴趣
He's never shown the slightest bit of interest.

311
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,390
一旦他娶了你  他就能够染指英格兰
When he had his hands on you, he had his hands on England.

312
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,370
所以他决定娶我
So he's decided to wed me,

313
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,180
让三个国家都归他所有
then keep all three crowns for himself.

314
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,890
所以他才突然慷慨地接受了
Thus his suddenly generous acceptance

315
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,810
你没有怀孕这件事
of the fact that you are not pregnant...

316
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,790
至今没有怀孕
yet.

317
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,060
他想亲自让你怀上子嗣
He wants to give you an heir himself.

318
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,180
还有那个如同大屠杀一样的展示  
And the spectacle, the carnage...

319
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,970
-拙劣的展示出他的威武  -难道他真认为
- Botched display of his prowess. - Does he honestly think

320
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,360
我和弗朗西斯会同意废除我们的婚姻吗
that Francis and I would agree to have our marriage annulled?

321
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,610
这简直太荒谬了
It's ridiculous!

322
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,290
不
No.

323
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,690
他不会这样做的
Even he wouldn't.

324
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,200
他要杀害自己的亲生儿子
He's going to kill his own son!

325
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,970
如果你所料不错的话
If you're right,

326
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,030
我们只有一个机会
our only chance

327
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,870
那就是拿下他和他的卫兵
is to overtake him and his guards.

328
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,120
假设弗朗西斯能够说服那些将军
Assuming that Francis is able to persuade the generals

329
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,600
和我们一起进行政变
to join us in a coup.

330
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,990
如果弗朗西斯回来时
If Francis comes back

331
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,890
走在军队前面  我们就知道他成功了
at the head of an army, we'll know he succeeded.

332
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,250
如果他孤身回来
If he comes back alone,

333
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,020
我们就根本无法反抗亨利
we have no protection from Henry,

334
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,620
弗朗西斯也是如此
and neither does Francis.

335
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,220
说你呢
You there,

336
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,930
这是怎么回事
what's this?

337
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,100
这是怎么回事
What is this?

338
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,200
发生了什么
What happened here?

339
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,310
我请求你们  实话实说
I beg of you, speak freely.

340
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,180
殿下  这就是史上最壮观的海上奇观展示
The greatest naval spectacle of all time, my lord.

341
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,760
直到船爆炸之前
That is, until the ship exploded.

342
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,000
国王用火药取代了烟花
The king replaced the fireworks with gunpowder.

343
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,180
他们在加来逃过一劫  到来来确是这样
Can you believe they survived Calais for this?

344
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,360
这些士兵都是去过加来的吗
These soldiers are from Calais?

345
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,110
明天再次展示时  人数就会翻倍了
There'll be twice as many tomorrow when they do it again.

346
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,430
这不可能
That's impossible.

347
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,750
-谁也不准再进行一次  -请您原谅
- No one would do this again. - Begging your pardon,

348
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,480
但你肯定没想到
but you would think no one

349
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,380
会有人第一次做出这种事情对吗
would do it the first time, wouldn't you?

350
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,580
但你得想想
Still, you've got to wonder

351
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,700
谁更可怜
who's worse off,

352
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,080
是这些可怜人
these poor fellows

353
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,010
还是那些准备起航去英格兰的
or the ones shipping off for England.

354
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,710
至少他们还能死个痛快
At least for them it was quick.

355
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,990
谁也不准起航
No one is shipping out.

356
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,060
这是国王的旨意
King's orders.

357
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,370
你这话还是留给那3000个
Tell that to the 3,000 men

358
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,800
明晚就起航的人听吧
leaving tomorrow night.

359
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,180
你想让我加入你们的政变
You want me to join a coup?

360
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,700
也许今天你还能得到亨利的宠幸
You may have Henry's favor today,

361
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,990
但不会长久
but it can't last.

362
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,070
国王的行为一日比一日更癫狂
The king's behavior is getting more erratic every day.

363
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,870
他疯了的消息会散播出去
News of his madness will spread,

364
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,720
觊觎王位的人会陆续出现
contenders for the throne will appear,

365
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,010
内战肯定会不可避免
and civil war will follow, one way or another.

366
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,950
我理解你的逻辑
And I can't disagree with your logic,

367
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,100
但如果我们要成功进行政变的话
but we lack one essential element

368
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,650
我们还缺少一个要素
for a successful coup.

369
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,280
一位近在眼前而且有所准备的领袖
A leader ready and at hand

370
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,430
他得在国王去世之时填补王位的空缺
to fill the power vacuum once the king is gone.

371
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,880
领袖当然是弗朗西斯了
Well, Francis will be the leader, obviously.

372
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,050
他就是下一任国王
He'll be the next king.

373
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,970
弗朗西斯会因他父亲的错背上污名
Francis carries the stain of his father's mistakes.

374
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,450
他身上具备政变所反对的一切
He represents everything the coup would be against.

375
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,760
我们需要一位能凝聚整个国家的贵族
We need someone the nobles and the nation can rally around.

376
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,720
而你  玛丽  就是这个王国的希望
You, Mary, bring the promise of empire.

377
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,070
好好把握机会  用不了多久
Use the promise that someday soon,

378
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,150
英格兰所有的权利和财富就尽在你手中了
England and all its power and riches will be yours.

379
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,010
好好把握这个机会
Use this to make yourself

380
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,450
让自己成为法国最有权利的人
the most powerful person in France.

381
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,590
权利比我丈夫还大吗
More powerful than my husband?

382
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,770
如果你想要拥有一个国家
If you want to lay claim to a nation,

383
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,290
那就拿下法国吧
take France.

384
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,260
黑暗怎么会
Why would the Darkness

385
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,100
把一个小男孩带到这里来呢
bring a young boy to this place?

386
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,930
房屋尽毁
Every house deserted.

387
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,530
这些人都怎么了
What happened to these people?

388
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,880
一年前  这个地区被洪水淹没
The area was beset by flood a year ago.

389
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,240
这个镇子处在高地
The town sits on higher ground.

390
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,780
为什么却没人到这里来住呢
Why did no one settle here?

391
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,260
不是完全被废弃
Not entirely deserted.

392
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,990
这家人原来是住在这里的
The family that once lived here.

393
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,650
从这恶臭来看  我敢说还有另一个受害者
From the stench, I'd say there was another victim.

394
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,760
这是帕斯卡尔的围巾
Pascal's scarf.

395
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,680
这个祭品不久之前刚死的
This sacrifice is fresh,

396
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,960
几天前吧
a few days old.

397
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,060
帕斯卡尔身上的血肯定是他的
This is where the blood on Pascal came from.

398
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,970
从灰尘看  这些画早就有了
From the dirt, these picture have been here a long time.

399
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,580
风暴
A storm...

400
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,280
大火
fire...

401
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,290
-洪水  -灾难
- flood. - Disasters.

402
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,630
-为什么画在这里  -这应该是在叙述
- But why draw them here? - I think they may be depictions

403
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,950
真实发生在这片土地上的事吧
of actual events that occurred in this region.

404
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,880
大风暴
The Great Storm?

405
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,190
差不多是20年前的事了
Nearly two decades ago.

406
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,140
几年后  一场大火肆虐
Years later, the fire that raged

407
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,280
摧毁了昂热和附近的森林
destroyed Angers and the nearby forests.

408
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,330
洪水淹没了周边所有地区
The flood that wiped out the surrounding areas.

409
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,700
还有被遮住的太阳
And the blackening of the sun.

410
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,590
日食是最近发生的事情
The eclipse so recently witnessed.

411
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,160
这些是预言吗
Are these predictions?

412
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,820
是准确的预言
Accurate predictions.

413
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,260
这是什么意思
What does this one mean?

414
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,960
星辰从空中坠落
Stars falling from the sky.

415
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,630
我不知道
I don't know,

416
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,770
但只剩这一个未解了
but it's the only one left.

417
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,680
这是异教徒的韵文
It's a pagan rhyme.

418
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,590
我听到帕斯卡尔自己念唱过
I heard Pascal chanting it to himself.

419
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,030
我在星空下安躺
"I lie behind the star-bright sky.

420
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,620
不怕此生与过往
"I do not fear this life's good-bye.

421
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,340
闭眼感受我的爱抚
"Close your eyes for my caress...

422
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,500
因为我就是黑暗
for I am the Darkness."

423
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,390
我在星空下安躺
"I lie behind the star-bright sky.

424
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,430
不怕此生与过往
I do not fear this life's good-bye."

425
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,250
帕斯卡尔  为什么又在吟诵这几句韵文
Pascal, why are you saying that rhyme again?

426
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,510
你害怕了吗
Are you scared?

427
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,670
太安静了
It's too quiet.

428
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,260
卫兵都去哪了
Where are the guards?

429
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,150
快走  快走
Come on! Come on!

430
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,230
快啊
Come on!

431
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,270
快点
Come on!

432
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,870
退后
Get back!

433
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,850
卫兵
Guards!

434
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,440
卫兵  救命啊
Guards, help!

435
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,150
你的卫兵已经死了
Your guards are dead,

436
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,710
你很快就会见到他们
and soon you will be, too,

437
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,740
但是这个男孩会活下去
but the boy will survive.

438
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,230
把他给我
Give him to me.

439
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,940
求你了  放过我们吧
Please leave us!

440
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,040
不行
I cannot.

441
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,790
我是黑暗
I am the Darkness,

442
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,390
是吞噬者
the Devourer,

443
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,860
是众神的侍奉者
the feeder of the gods,

444
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,790
但我不能永远侍奉他们
but I cannot feed them forever.

445
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,820
帕斯卡尔
Pascal,

446
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,580
把她的血献给众神
offer her blood to the gods.

447
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,430
在他们的欲望膨胀之前安抚一下
Appease their hunger before it grows.

448
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,980
失陪一下
Excuse me.

449
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,350
这是船上所有军官的名单
I have a list of the officers on the boat.

450
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,870
你家男人叫什么名字
What's your bloke's name?

451
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,870
他叫利思・贝亚德  但我觉得他不是军官
Leith Bayard, but I don't think he was an officer.

452
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,390
步兵应该在另一个地方
The foot soldiers are laid out elsewhere.

453
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,800
-我可以带你去  -葛瑞尔
- I can show you. - Greer!

454
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,020
你活下来了  你还活着
You survived. You survived.

455
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,000
所以大家才喜欢看马上长矛比武
This is why the people love a joust.

456
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,750
在久战之后  看皇室成员
Seeing nobles knocked on their asses

457
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,200
倒在地上
after a long war.

458
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,160
蒙特格利伯爵又打败了一个对手
Ah, Lord Montgomery takes down another opponent.

459
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,900
大家都去哪里了
Where is everybody?

460
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,290
他们为什么都这么低落
And why are they all so dour?

461
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,500
这是骑马比武  不是葬礼
They're at a joust, not a funeral.

462
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,830
因为你的模拟战  很多人失去了亲人  亨利
Many of them lost loved ones in your mock battle, Henry.

463
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,360
向玛丽女王致敬
Hail Queen Mary.

464
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,740
谢天谢地
Good God, finally.

465
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,560
是英格兰皇冠  玛丽
It's the English crest. Mary!

466
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,830
天哪  她穿着英格兰大衣
My God, she's wearing the English coat of arms.

467
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,840
苏格兰女王
The Queen of Scotland!

468
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,860
她一定是打算在英格兰称王了
She's all but declaring herself England's queen.

469
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,520
玛丽  玛丽
Mary! Mary! 

470
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,440
玛丽  玛丽
Mary! Mary!

471
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,590
玛丽  玛丽
Mary! Mary!

472
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,330
我们就知道  只需一件表明身份的衣服
Who knew all it took was a statement dress

473
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,650
法国就会在她的股掌之中
to get France in the palm of her hands.

474
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,180
她代表着未来
She is the future.

475
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,830
他们看到了
They see that.

476
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,260
我看不到她
I can't see her!

477
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,950
你准备好了  是吧
You're ready, aren't you?

478
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,000
简直就像我们做着同样的梦
It's like we dream the same dreams.

479
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,850
玛丽  玛丽  玛丽女王万岁
Mary, Mary! Long live Queen Mary!

480
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,240
玛丽女王
Queen Mary!

481
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,350
她真的要继承英格兰吗
Is she really taking England?

482
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,840
他们已经失控了
They've lost control of themselves.

483
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,450
他们忘记了国王是谁吗
Have they forgotten who the king is?

484
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,620
我来给他们调节一下气氛
I'll give them something to cheer for.

485
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,810
暂停比赛
Halt the competition!

486
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,440
我要跟蒙特格利伯爵比一场
I am going to joust Lord Montgomery. 

487
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,740
裁判
Gamekeeper...

488
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,520
但是  国王陛下  他的盔甲破损了
But, Your Majesty, his armor's damaged,

489
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,930
而且需要换一匹马
he'll need a fresh horse.

490
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,100
那你快点去办啊
Then you have much to attend to.

491
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,300
英格兰的人陆续离开了
Members of the English contingent are leaving.

492
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,580
他们要去警告伊丽莎白
Off to warn Elizabeth.

493
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,220
但愿你知道你在做什么
I hope you know what you're doing.

494
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,890
派你的骑兵跟踪他们
Send your riders after theirs.

495
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,330
如果他们中途停下  应该能发现法国境内的
If they stop, they may reveal some English sympathizers

496
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,470
英国支持者
amongst the French.

497
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,680
你这是置你表亲伊丽莎白于死地
You're squeezing your cousin Elizabeth's throat,

498
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,810
为了什么
and to what end?

499
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,120
给人们希望
To give the people hope.

500
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,090
让他们想象一个更好的未来
So they can imagine a brighter future.

501
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,670
你说得好听
Such glory you promise.

502
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,340
你现在已经如此贪婪
And so cunning you've become.

503
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,610
你从修道院回来之后  变了太多
How you've changed since you came back to us from convent.

504
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,410
我想念曾经的你
I miss the girl you were.

505
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,550
很多人都会的
Many will.

506
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,390
因为她更容易被杀
She was easier to kill.

507
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,580
我爱你  我爱你
I love you. I love you.

508
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,500
-我去把门关上  -关着呢
- I have to secure the door. - It's locked.

509
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,490
那我帮你脱衣服吧
Let me help you undress.

510
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,220
你  你就抱抱我
Please, just... just hold me,

511
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,880
多抱一会  好吗
a little more, please.

512
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,800
我们没必要停下来
We have no reason to stop.

513
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,220
我想娶你
I want to marry you.

514
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,000
葛瑞尔  不要这样
Greer, don't do this.

515
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,800
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

516
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,940
我没死
I'm not.

517
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,080
我活生生地站在你面前
I'm standing right here before you,

518
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,480
你不应该再赶我走
and you should not let me go.

519
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,730
不管是为了钱  为了你的家人  或是什么
Not for money, or your family, or anything.

520
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,020
什么都没变
Nothing's changed,

521
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,460
我只是无比深切地感受到了
except I felt the pain of your loss more deeply

522
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,700
你曾经的痛苦
than I ever thought I could.

523
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,210
没错
And you will.

524
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,830
我发誓  葛瑞尔
I swear to you, Greer,

525
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,000
如果你不抓住这次机会  你还会痛不欲生
if you don't take this chance with me, you will.

526
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,250
嫁给我
Marry me.

527
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,240
嫁给我吧
Marry me!

528
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,920
不  利思  不行
No, Leith, I can't.

529
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,860
我不能
I can't!

530
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,680
等你感到孤独痛苦的时候
When you are alone and miserable,

531
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,890
记得  从这一刻起
remember this is the moment

532
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,960
是你亲手葬送了你的幸福
that you threw your happiness away.

533
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,870
我也不会忘记
And I'll remember you as the woman

534
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,790
你说我配不上你
who told me I wasn't enough.

535
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,280
我会拥有一切
I will become everything

536
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,000
能满足你的一切
you are so convinced that you need.

537
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,240
我会青云直上  飞黄腾达
I will rise and rise and rise,

538
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,160
直到拥有无上的财富与权力
until I am rich and powerful.

539
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,050
但你再也得不到我了
But I will never be yours again.

540
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,930
您的长矛  国王陛下
Your lance, Your Highness.

541
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,290
亨利国王陛下
His Majesty King Henry

542
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,950
对阵蒙特格利伯爵
and Lord Montgomery.

543
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,370
蒙特格利这是自讨苦吃
I suppose that's good comeuppance for Montgomery.

544
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,560
等着被狠狠击败吧
He will have to take the blows...

545
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,090
在统治者面前卖弄可没好下场
it's bad business to outshine your boss.

546
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,140
亨利国王
King Henry!

547
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,330
老天呐  快去看看他
For God's sake, go to him!

548
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,630
国王还好吗
Is the king all right?

549
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,790
陛下  陛下
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

550
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,260
国王陛下
Your Majesty!

551
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,600
国王身受重伤
The king has been gravely injured!

552
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,240
医生都去哪儿了
Where is the physician?!

553
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,030
国王陛下
Your Majesty...

554
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,610
没事了
It's all right.

555
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,630
我来了  你们受伤了吗
I'm here. Are you hurt?

556
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,690
没有  不过...巴斯  当心
No, but... Bash, look out!

557
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,650
带肯娜和帕斯卡尔离开
Get Kenna and Pascal out of here.

558
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,850
帕斯卡尔必须接任我
Pascal must succeed me,

559
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,540
不然黑死病会席卷而来
or the Black Death will awaken.

560
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,620
黑死病
The Black Death.

561
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,820
一场鼠疫
The plague.

562
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,230
维斯嘉德的种种迹象都预示着它的到来
That's what the signs at Visegard were counting down to.

563
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,780
巴斯  我看到过幻象
Bash, I've had visions.

564
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,740
城堡被死亡所笼罩  走廊上躺满了尸体
The castle beset by death. Bodies laid out in the hall.

565
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,100
如果我不完成任务  惨象就会发生
It will happen, if my work is not done.

566
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,880
看好肯娜和帕斯卡尔  快点
Stay with Kenna and Pascal, please.

567
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,460
能预见未来的天资少之又少
How rare is the gift of sight.

568
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,990
我不相信你可以
I don't believe you have it.

569
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,180
你是个杀手
I think you're a killer,

570
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,930
只会利用别人的恐惧
feeding on others' fears.

571
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,200
你也是异教徒
You're pagan-born.

572
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,050
嘴上抵赖也好  但在你内心
Deny it, but in your heart

573
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,040
你深知神明掌控着一切
you know the gods have power.

574
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,190
他们需要尊重
They demand respect.

575
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,300
需要血祭
Blood.

576
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,740
如果得不到...
And if they don't get it...

577
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,700
是你贪图鲜血  而非神明
You took the blood, not the gods.

578
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,140
我是来救你的
I'm here to save you.

579
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,730
我带领我的人进入血泊森林
I took my people into the Blood Wood

580
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,690
教给他们如何供奉神明
and showed them how to feed the gods,

581
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,340
从那时起鼠疫再没爆发过
and since that day the plague has not returned.

582
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,490
是神明控制住了瘟疫
But the gods hold it leashed,

583
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,760
在暗处看着我们
in the shadows,

584
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,120
如果我死后没有继任者
and if I die without a successor,

585
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,610
瘟疫便会卷土重来
it will run wild over the land.

586
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,690
把帕斯卡尔交给我
Bring Pascal to me,

587
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,470
我会拯救这个世界
and I will save your world.

588
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,490
他父亲知道这是他的使命
His father knew it was his fate.

589
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,050
-他知道这是无上的光荣  -不行
- He understood the honor. - No.

590
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,280
不能伤害无辜的孩子
No more children,

591
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,770
再没有所谓的献祭
no more sacrifices,

592
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,990
我要结束你残忍的杀戮
and the slaughter of innocents ends here.

593
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,440
不会结束的
It can't end!

594
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,580
他还活着吗
Does he live yet?

595
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,980
弥留之际
He lingers.

596
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,180
他们说  可能撑不过去了
He won't survive; they say he can't.

597
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,670
一段长矛刺进了他的大脑
There's pieces of the lance stuck in his brain.

598
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,710
这是我们造成的吗
Is this what we wanted?

599
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,280
不是
It isn't.

600
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,460
亨利被刺落马下不是我们能控制的
Henry's fall was out of our hands completely.

601
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,900
这难道不是神的旨意吗
Is that not God's will?

602
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,960
不会再有人献出生命了
Now no more blood needs to be spilled.

603
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,370
除了我父亲
None but my father's.

604
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,090
我们去跟他道别吧
We should say good-bye.

605
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,870
不管我们感情如何
In spite of our feelings,

606
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,680
我所做的一切都是为了
I've always tried to do what's been best

607
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,630
我们的孩子和你
for our children and for you.

608
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,020
也是为了法国
And for France.

609
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,180
没什么好遗憾的
Shh, there are no more regrets.

610
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,200
一直以来  我都是爱你的
In my way, I have always loved you.

611
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,910
你是我此生的至爱
You are the love of my life.

612
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,980
你又变得如此仁慈了
Oh, to see your kindness returned...

613
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,770
你也是
Yours must, as well.

614
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,840
你内心一直如此
It's in you still.

615
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,110
以后对黛安也要仁慈些
You must show it to Diane.

616
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,980
我走后  她就无依无靠了
She is unprotected once I'm gone.

617
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,330
我的...我们的生活中  她占据了大部分
After being so much a part of my life, of ours...

618
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,410
你们谁都不该感到孤独
neither of you should be alone.

619
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,720
在整个大家族中  很多时候...
She is extended family, your equal in s...

620
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,270
她都与你平起平坐
so many ways.

621
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,610
凯瑟琳
Catherine...

622
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,110
对她友好些
...be friends.

623
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,240
请照顾好她
Please reach out to her.

624
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,560
好吧
Yes.

625
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,330
我会照顾她的
I will reach out to her.

626
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,740
休息吧  亨利
Rest now, Henry.

627
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,920
放心去吧
Rest long.

628
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,010
把弗朗西斯叫来
Francis, now.

629
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,820
让他单独过来
Just Francis.

630
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,920
弗朗西斯  你有什么要对我说的吗
Francis, what have you come to say to me?

631
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,840
每一个错误  都必须纠正吗
Must we right every wrong?

632
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,230
我听不懂您的意思  父亲
I'm not sure what you mean, Father.

633
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,470
看看你
Oh, it's you.

634
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,460
我有没有说过  你的名字跟我兄长一样
Did I tell you that you were named after my elder brother?

635
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,270
他本来要当国王的
He was to be king.

636
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,430
他害怕当国王
He feared the job,

637
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,270
害怕要因此夺取人的生命
the giving and taking of lives to a cause.

638
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,960
他这方面也很像你
He was like you in that way, too.

639
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,980
我觉得他很软弱
I thought him weak.

640
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,120
我知道我能成为更好的国王
I knew I would be a better king.

641
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,560
自始至终都是一场较量
It was a competition all along.

642
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,600
权利的游戏  对至亲之人最严苛
Such games we play against those we love.

643
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,820
我大获全胜
I won it all.

644
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,920
在一个网球场上
On a tennis court of all places.

645
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,560
我往他的水里下了毒
When he collapsed

646
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,870
他很快就死了
after I poisoned his water.

647
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,960
你杀了你哥哥
You killed your brother.

648
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,190
没有人知道
No one ever knew.

649
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,840
我终于知道你为何要我小心自己的兄弟
Now I know why you warned me against my brother.

650
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,310
让我和塞巴斯蒂安反目
Turned me against Sebastian.

651
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,070
背叛你爱的人
Betraying someone you love

652
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,320
会污染你的灵魂
blackens your soul.

653
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,480
这种负担
It's a weight you carry

654
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,180
要背一辈子
all of your days.

655
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,290
我现在可以放开了吗
Can I let it go now?

656
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,670
上帝原谅我
God forgive me.

657
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,590
国王已死
The king is dead.

658
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,090
国王万岁
Long live the king!

659
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,500
国王已死  国王万岁
The king is dead. Long live the king!

660
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,170
国王已死  国王万岁
The king is dead. Long live the king!

661
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,170
国王已死  国王万岁
The king is dead. Long live the king!

662
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,760
国王已死  国王万岁
The king is dead. Long live the king!

663
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,750
你好啊
Well, hello there.

664
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,980
我是利思  还记得我吗
Leith. Do you recall?

665
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,840
我叫伊薇特  和"当然记得"押韵
Yvette. Rhymes with "How could I forget?"

666
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,620
根据祝酒和流言所说
A new government is forming

667
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,180
新政权正在崛起
between toasts and whispers.

668
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,540
这值得干一杯
So let's have that drink now.

669
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,230
发生了什么吗
What changed?

670
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,970
上次我们见面时  你走得很匆忙
You were in such a hurry when last we met.

671
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,330
我那时还不渴
I wasn't thirsty then.

672
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,170
现在渴了
I am now.

673
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,950
下次吧
Another time.

674
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,900
等会儿我要见另一个人
As this hour, I am destined to meet another.

675
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,840
-真让我心碎啊  -怎么会呢
- Aren't you a heartbreaker? - Not at all.

676
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,170
你也不要让我心碎哦
Don't you be one, either.

677
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,720
你迟到了
You're late.

678
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,390
只迟了一会儿
Only barely.

679
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,620
我等了你这么久  无聊透顶
I couldn't leave right away as I'd spent hours

680
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,240
我不能马上离开
waiting for you, bored senseless,

681
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,650
突然  我...
and then suddenly, I...

682
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,230
父亲
Oh, Father.

683
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,740
今晚发生了最奇妙的逆转
My evening took the loveliest turn.

684
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,440
村里面传信来了
Word's back from the village.

685
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,610
接生婆生病了  没办法过来
The midwife's taken ill herself and is no condition to travel.

686
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,060
宝宝马上就要出生了
The baby should have come by now.

687
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,400
没错  应该是这样
Yes. It should have.

688
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,740
我担心他不能活下来  你也一样
I fear for its life, and yours as well.

689
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,120
我不想吓着你
I don't mean to scare you.

690
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,820
但你有没有想留下来的话
Are there words you want written down

691
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,970
以防万一
in case?

692
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,350
有
Yes.

693
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,840
但有没有什么办法
But if there's any way

694
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,100
可以救下这个孩子...
you can save the baby...

695
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,350
那些方法都会杀了你
None that wouldn't kill you.

696
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,740
我也没有其他办法
Or that I'm equipped for.

697
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,210
我亲爱的朋友  玛丽
"My dear friend, Mary.

698
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,430
我孤身一人  我的孩子拼命地
"I am alone and my child struggles

699
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,900
想来到这个世界
"to join this world.

700
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,570
你不用再遵守你的承诺了
"I release you from your promise,

701
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,580
也不用再因为我们的秘密保护我
"from the protection our secret gave me.

702
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,810
因为朱利安已经死了
"For Julien has died.

703
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,140
我可能马上就会见到他了
"And I'm afraid I may soon join him.

704
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,970
请前来救助我
"Please, bring help.

705
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,300
但如果我死去  但孩子活了下来
"But if I die and the child survives,

706
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,040
请照顾我的孩子  视如己出
"care for my baby as if it were your own.

707
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,180
和弗朗西斯一起照顾他
With Francis."

708
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,010
你的朋友是玛丽  苏格兰女王吗
Your friend is Mary, Queen of Scots?

709
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,070
没错
Yes.

710
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,550
请把这信带到城堡去
Please, have it taken to the castle.

711
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,400
快点
And hurry!

712
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,360
巴斯
Bash.

713
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,090
关于你父亲的事  我很遗憾
I'm so sorry about your father.

714
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,460
我不知道我的容身之处在哪里
I don't know what my place is here anymore.

715
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,600
你应该和我在一起
Your place is with me.

716
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,680
-不  我是说  -我知道你想说什么
- No, I meant... - I know what you meant.

717
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,980
你不需要凭借你父亲的名号
You don't need your father's name

718
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,310
或者什么屠龙本领来赢得尊重
or to slay every dragon to be worth something.

719
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,570
你已经做得够多了
You've done enough.

720
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,150
这样足够了
You are enough.

721
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,360
现在你应该寻找自己的幸福
Now you deserve some happiness of your own.

722
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,430
我在你身上找到了幸福
I think I found it in you.

723
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,440
我爱你
I love you.

724
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,690
我也爱你
I love you, too.

725
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,750
真是个奇迹
What a miracle.

726
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:31,950
快看
Look!

727
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,330
流星
Shooting star.

728
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,110
又一个
Ooh, another one.

729
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,860
星辰在陨落
The stars are falling.

730
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,410
黑暗说这是它回来的最终预兆
It's the final sign before the Darkness said it would return.

731
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,290
他说它将会横扫这片土地
He said it would sweep the land.

732
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,330
什么东西
What would?

733
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,710
黑死病
The plague.

734
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,410
弗朗西斯  你一晚没睡
Francis, you haven't slept!

735
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,930
贵族和我父亲的大臣
The nobles and my father's advisors

736
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,430
一晚上都在对我进谏
were in my ear all night.

737
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,910
我是法国国王
I am the king of France.

738
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,850
没错  你的确是
Yes, you are.

739
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,330
我从不想事情变成这样
I never wanted it to happen this way.

740
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,650
惧怕自己的父亲
Fearing my own father,

741
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,380
最后变成恨他
hating him at the end.

742
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:15,630
我看到了淹死在船里的那些尸体
I saw the bodies of those men that drowned in those boats.

743
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,810
那些被屠杀的英雄
Heroes slaughtered.

744
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,530
我看到他那样碰触你的脸
I saw the way that he touched your face.

745
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,920
你当时在赛场上吗
You were at the tournament?

746
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,700
玛丽  虽然你说过我父亲的死
Mary, I know that you said that my father's death

747
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,190
-是上帝的旨意  -弗朗西斯  就是这样的
- was God's will... - Francis, it was.

748
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,870
虽然有人会质问
Although some people would question a God

749
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,100
上帝赋予我们这些权力
who grants us such power, 

750
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,700
仅凭我们出身王族
based on nothing but the fortune of our birth.

751
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,610
这不公平  我们被赋予特权
It isn't fair, the privileges we are given.

752
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,950
却也必须为之付出代价
And the price we must pay for them.

753
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,410
我感觉得到自己的改变
I can feel myself changing.

754
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,650
而且并不是变好
And not for the better.

755
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,240
我做的每个决定
Every choice I have made

756
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,710
不论为了保护法国还是苏格兰  甚至是你
to protect France and Scotland, even you,

757
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,800
每次都得经过一番挣扎
for all of them there is a reckoning.

758
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,890
每一次都是真正的我输给了作为女王的我
And it's always the woman who must bow to the queen.

759
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,690
我感觉我杀死了一部分自己
I feel like I'm killing part of myself.

760
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,840
我无视我的内心  直到它可以装聋作哑
But I'm ignoring my heart until it becomes blind and deaf.

761
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,500
我感到自己越来越铁石心肠
I can feel myself growing harder 

762
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,960
我担心...
and I worry that I...

763
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,950
我会变成你不爱的样子
that I'm becoming someone you will not love.

764
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,770
那就别改变
Then don't.

765
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,460
不要变得狠心  我会分担你的痛苦
Don't grow harder, share your burdens,

766
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,630
什么事都跟我说  而我...
tell me your darkest truths, and I...

767
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,600
我也坦诚相对
I will tell you mine.

768
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,160
这样一来  我们就不会同床异梦
So we don't end up married but alone,

769
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,010
最终分道扬镳  愈行愈远
two people going down separate paths,

770
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,460
将一切罪恶看成是别无选择
justifying our sins as acts of survival.

771
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,420
如果我们可以相互原谅
If we can forgive each other, 

772
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,430
也许就能原谅我们自己
perhaps we can forgive ourselves.

773
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,420
打扰了  女王陛下
Excuse me, Your Grace,

774
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,770
但这是萝拉小姐发来的紧急信件
but there's an urgent letter from Lady Lola.

775
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,370
谢谢你
Thank you.

776
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,620
萝拉要分娩了
Lola's giving birth.

777
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,000
朱利安死了  她现在独自一人
Julien is dead, and she is all alone.

778
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:01,840
她在哪里
Where is she?

779
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,300
磨坊旁边的房子里
Uh, at-at a house by the mill.

780
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,010
你应该去
You should go.

781
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,210
我去
Me?

782
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,850
就是你
You.

783
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,620
因为你是孩子的父亲
Because you are the father of her child.

784
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,870
因为我想告诉你好久了
Because I've wanted to tell you for months.

785
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,920
因为  萝拉最终也希望你知道
Because, finally, Lola wants you to know it, too.

786
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,260
弗朗西斯  她说她可能活不下来
Francis, she writes that she may not survive.

787
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,950
没有时间了
There is no time to lose.

788
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,070
去陪着她  这是上帝的旨意
Be there when, God willing,

789
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,850
你的孩子要出生了
your child comes into the world.

790
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,910
快点  找到救援后
Hurry, and I will come and join you

791
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,730
我就赶过去
after I have gathered some help.

792
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,140
-一直以来  -我之后会解释
- All this time... - I will explain after.

793
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,250
但现在  我求求你  去陪在她身边
But for now I beg you, be by her side.

794
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,020
快去
Go.

795
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,250
我需要医生
I need a doctor.

796
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,470
或产婆  萝拉需要帮助
Or a midwife. Lola needs help.

797
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,650
没人能够离开或进入城堡
No one will be leaving or entering the castle.

798
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,700
暂时不行  我会和守卫说
Not for some time. I'll speak with the guards.

799
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,420
放下闸门  守住全部大门
The portcullis will be lowered, all gates will be secured.

800
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,520
为什么  发生什么了
Why? What's happening?

801
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,160
附近城镇传来消息
Word has come from surrounding villages.

802
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,710
开始有人死于瘟疫
People are dying of plague.

803
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,900
和染病的人共处一室
Standing in the same room 

804
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,860
就有可能被感染
with someone who is ill risks infection.

805
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,820
我知道瘟疫什么样
I know what the plague does. 

806
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,760
人们隐瞒他们患病
People are already hiding their sick 

807
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,530
生怕自己会被锁在家里
for fear of being locked in their homes with them.

808
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,260
但萝拉  她...
But, Lola, she...

809
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,810
你不能帮她
You cannot help her.

810
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,170
弗朗西斯正要离开城堡
Francis is leaving the castle

811
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,490
去陪着她
to go and be with her!

812
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,680
阻止他
Stop him!

813
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,340
弗朗西斯  等等
Francis, wait!

814
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,740
谢天谢地你还没走
Thank God you haven't left.

815
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,770
怎么了
What is it?

816
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,980
开始有人死去
People are dying.

817
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,460
瘟疫爆发了
The plague has come and it's spreading.

818
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,320
你母亲下令封锁城堡
Your mother has ordered the castle locked down.

819
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,240
萝拉就在不远处
Lola is not far from here.

820
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,700
我会带着她和孩子回来
I shall return with her and the baby.

821
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,360
不  弗朗西斯  你不能走
No, Francis, you can't leave.

822
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,170
你恳求我去陪在她身边
You urged me to be by her side.

823
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,480
你知道她现在不应该孤身奋战
You know she shouldn't be alone now.

824
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,430
这是个坏主意
It's a terrible decision,

825
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,160
但作为统治者
but it's our duty as rulers 

826
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,460
我们有责任做出正确决定
to make the right one.

827
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,350
你要去的是乡村  有可能接触到瘟疫
You are going to a village which has likely been exposed to plague. 

828
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,780
如果你带回来感染了瘟疫的人...
If you bring back people who may have been infected with it... 

829
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,630
人
"People"?

830
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,350
是你的朋友
Your friend. 

831
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,640
我的孩子  可能是我唯一的孩子
My child, perhaps my only child.

832
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,810
你不仅是在拿自己的命冒险
You're not just risking your life,

833
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,670
还有城堡里每个人的生命
but everyone in this castle.

834
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,190
如果你走了  带回来感染了瘟疫的人...
If you leave, and you return with anybody who is ill...

835
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,210
玛丽  你说感觉自己变得狠绝了
Mary, you said you felt yourself growing harder.

836
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,440
别变成那样
Don't let it happen.

837
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,560
倾听你的心声
Listen to your heart,

838
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,340
你会听到的  就像我一样
and you will hear it as clearly as I do.

839
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,720
你是法国国王
You are the king of France!

840
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,940
你不再有遵从内心的权利
You no longer have the privilege of obeying your heart!

841
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,790
我不想做那样的国王
That's not the kind of king that I want to be.

842
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,800
把城门关上
Lower the gates.

843
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,360
-但弗朗西斯国王  -他很清楚现状危急
- But King Francis... - Is aware of the threat to us all.

844
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,070
马上关上城门
Lower the gates now.

845
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
