4
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,780
Previously on Reign...

5
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,980
I know the ch‚teau you claim to stay
at in Angers where you ran into Francis.

6
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,490
I don't know what happened between
the two of you,but I can guess.

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,050
You don't have to marry
him. It's all over.

8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,640
Nostradamus said we can be wed.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,970
There is no prophecy keeping us apart.

10
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,500
I do this not out of any
malice,as you are my son.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,070
So that should you return,

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,260
you have seared into your memory

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,520
what is yours and what is not.

14
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,670
You're very quiet.

15
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,530
Are you warm enough?

16
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,380
I just wish that we could go back

17
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,250
to two months ago,do it all over.

18
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,940
Me in my wedding gown,walking down
the aisle to you at Notre Dame.

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,930
But instead,we have to
come back to reality.

20
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,920
That's what you're thinking.

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,860
Politics,backstabbing,murder.

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,290
Just another day at French court.

23
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,430
Francis,can we turn around and go
back to the country house at Anet?

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,480
Everything we felt there
alone,away from court.

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,400
Somehow our love seems
so fragile,suddenly.

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,270
Things are different now.

27
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,780
We're married... the
future king and queen.

28
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,090
My mother is no longer an obstacle.

29
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,940
Nostradamus's prophecy
no longer a threat.

30
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,390
And Bash is far away in Spain.

31
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,630
I hope he's safe,and
that he finds happiness.

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,170
Well,there is something

33
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,980
that everyone will want
from us that we can agree on.

34
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,690
A castle full of little royals?

35
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,430
Archduke,we thank you and
your sister for coming.

36
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,850
The last thing either of
us wants is a senseless,

37
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,670
costly war caused by a tragic mistake.

38
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,930
A French ship firing upon a
Bohemian vessel without provocation?

39
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,760
Yes,that is indeed a mistake.

40
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,250
But not a mistake of intent.

41
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,000
An accident.

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,100
France is very sorry,and
will do all it can

43
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,040
to maintain its peaceful and prosperous

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,750
friendship with the
great nation of Bohemia.

45
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,080
In keeping with our agreement

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,100
that I provide a new suitor each week...

47
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,000
While I provide you with an
infinite amount of carnal pleasure?

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,280
Who is it this time?

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,940
The last one was simple-minded.

50
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,100
The one before that smelled of
vinegar and had an abundance of earwax.

51
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,800
Well,he also had an abundance of land.

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,750
But no matter.I'm sure
the Archduke of Bohemia

53
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,190
- will keep up to your high standards.
- The archduke?

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,660
What's wrong with him?

55
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,150
He's perfect.

56
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,490
He's clearly attracted to you.

57
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,420
He's a foreigner,so he
doesn't know your reputation.

58
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,610
He'll take you far,far away from me.

59
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,610
There's only one difficulty.

60
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,440
The archduke is a pious man.

61
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,690
He'll expect his new bride to be chaste.

62
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,650
A virgin?

63
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,010
- Everybody knows that...
- I'm the king;

64
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,760
I'll make sure no one mentions
your lack of virtue to him.

65
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,200
You want me to trick a deeply
religious man into marrying me?

66
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,580
- If your conscience won't permit it...
- My Lord,

67
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,510
would you please present me
to our distinguished visitor?

68
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,810
Archduke Ferdinand.

69
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,940
The Lady Kenna.

70
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,410
I'll leave you to it,then,hmm?

71
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,920
I'm delighted to meet you,Lady Kenna.

72
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,450
Oh,the delight is all mine.

73
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,620
You'll have to excuse
my nerves,of course.

74
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,360
I'm not used to the attentions
of such a powerful man.

75
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,070
I missed you all!

76
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,370
You both look happy.

77
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,030
We were. We are.

78
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,160
I'm sure we'll be just as
happy here as we were in Paris,

79
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,830
and Anet,and every castle
from here to the Loire Valley.

80
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh,which reminds me.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,140
I found a wonderful
suitor for you,Greer.

82
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,700
And there's one in Paris who
is very keen to meet you,Lola.

83
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,200
Wonderful.

84
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,180
Mary!Oh,how I've missed you.

85
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,880
A word.

86
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,740
And so the politics
and backstabbing begin.

87
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,320
You must tell me all about
your travels... later.

88
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,480
First,you need to know that your
bastard brother didn't make it to Spain.

89
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,510
What do you mean?

90
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,120
I sent those guards with him myself.

91
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,130
They were supposed to accompany him
to a ship and see him safely on board.

92
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,500
The bodies of those men you sent

93
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,070
were found by the side of the road,

94
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,490
not long after you
left for your honeymoon.

95
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,800
But Bash's body was not found?

96
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,400
Either he killed the guards himself,

97
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,250
or the whole party was
attacked,and he managed to escape.

98
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,160
Are they looking for him?

99
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,600
Of course. Henry has his
men looking everywhere.

100
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,380
Aren't you glad you have a mother
who pays attention to such things?

101
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,270
You are a...

102
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,380
Hunter. Yes,you fool.

103
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,950
Have I offended you?

104
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,200
What kind of a fool can't recognize

105
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,700
a boar trap?

106
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,410
The embarrassed kind?

107
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,200
If you were such a tracker,didn't
you think it strange

108
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,700
that there were leaves on a patch
of snow surrounded by evergreens?

109
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,800
Who's this then?

110
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,390
Bash,my brother Carrick.

111
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,440
Bash tried to ruin my boar trap.

112
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,790
I would have seen it.

113
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,650
She tackled me prematurely.

114
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,220
Then we competed to see who
could shoot the most pheasants.

115
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,190
Be nice,Carrick.He's a guest.

116
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,230
Well,guest...

117
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,040
you're the first man my
sister's ever brought home.

118
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,380
Don't worry. I'm not staying.

119
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,500
- I'm just a hunter passing through.
- Really? To where?

120
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,340
It's the boar.

121
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,170
Wait!

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,870
My God.

123
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,950
Olivia?

124
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,790
It fits perfectly! Thank you!

125
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,150
I love mine. How utterly virginal.

126
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,440
And utterly ironic.

127
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,490
Oh,you're not wearing your gown,Lola.

128
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,940
Uh,it's incredibly lovely,but
I'm afraid it's a bit snug.

129
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,190
Oh,don't worry. We'll have
the seamstresses work on it.

130
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,690
So,Mary,tell us,are you pregnant?

131
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,810
Greer!

132
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,400
It's been almost two months.You
know everyone's wondering.

133
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,650
Two months isn't very long.

134
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,600
I thought you loved marzipan.

135
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,000
Lola,are you all right?

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,330
Perfectly fine. Thanks.

137
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,960
How do you know her?

138
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,700
Beneath the dirt,this
dress is fine silk.

139
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,700
It would take weeks to weave.

140
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,910
Only a noble could afford to buy it.

141
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,710
Carrick.

142
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,880
The girl's been fed on.

143
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,140
She can't stay.

144
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,650
And what do you suggest I do?

145
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,320
Throw her back into the woods to die?

146
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,090
She needs help,a physician.

147
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,750
This is our home. You
get her out of here.

148
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,960
No! No!

149
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,650
Olivia,it's all right. It's all right.

150
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,650
- T... take my blood!
- Olivia!

151
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,000
She's been chosen.

152
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,420
She's been touched by the darkness.

153
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,970
I've been a widower over a year.

154
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,670
My advisors are constantly
pressuring me to find a new wife.

155
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,930
You poor dear.

156
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,960
How absolutely awful.

157
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,440
I was just wondering how
you feel about an older...

158
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,350
More experienced suitor?

159
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,010
Well,I must admit that the
thought makes my heart beat faster.

160
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,980
Is that wrong to admit?

161
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,000
Is it sinful?I just... I don't know.

162
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,500
There. Why,you sweet young thing.

163
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,760
Your Majesty,it pleases
me that the relationship

164
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,200
between our nations is so...

165
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,560
congenial!

166
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,460
Do you worry for your reputation?

167
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,150
Yes,but... more than that.

168
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,740
Uh... this...

169
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,730
is God's vessel.

170
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,230
I need to make sure that I'm pure

171
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,920
for the man I choose
to devote my life to.

172
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,430
What a relief to find a
woman who understands that.

173
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,580
Oh,you must meet my sister...
you are cut from the same cloth.

174
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,810
Is this all you can give me?

175
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,230
The pain in my joints has worsened.

176
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,290
Laudanum is difficult
to obtain,but I'll...

177
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,250
I'll do my best.

178
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,220
I thought you were in Spain.

179
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,090
And Olivia D'Amencourt,I
thought,had left court.

180
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,050
What happened to the poor girl?

181
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,060
She was wandering the woods in
a confused and terrified state.

182
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,260
- The slashes she did herself.
- Poor child.

183
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,810
These aren't slashes,they're bite marks.

184
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,810
But are they animal or human?

185
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,020
I don't know.

186
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,800
I was told she was chosen.

187
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,060
Is it possible that she had an encounter

188
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,290
with whatever it is the pagans
are worshipping in the woods?

189
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,060
Whatever thing is,that
creature that requires blood.

190
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,880
I don't believe in such beings.

191
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,570
Well,nor did I,and yet here she is.

192
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,340
I don't believe there are
things that require blood.

193
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,110
You don't believe there's a
dark,malignant power in the woods?

194
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,930
Nature is not malignant.

195
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,660
Nature doesn't care.

196
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,060
Only humans are malignant.

197
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,010
There's nothing evil in the woods.

198
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,300
Unless it comes from us.

199
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,550
Olivia!Can you hear me?

200
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,760
- Can you help her?
- I can try.

201
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,250
I'll tell no one she's here
for now... she needs rest

202
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,230
and gentle treatment,not
a dozen questioners.

203
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,610
You should leave.

204
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,880
It's not safe for you here.

205
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,520
You asked to see me?

206
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,560
Ah,Mary. Mm.

207
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,890
My dear,now that we're fast friends,

208
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,780
I'd like to help you with
something of the utmost importance.

209
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,900
Babies.

210
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,190
Excuse me?

211
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,620
Your duty,in case you are unaware,

212
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,050
is to produce an heir and
ensure the future of your line.

213
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,960
Yes,I am well aware of that. Thank you.

214
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,160
And yet you stand
before me looking svelte.

215
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,320
You aren't pregnant,are you?

216
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,290
We only just got back,

217
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,720
and we haven't been
married for very long.

218
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,330
Rub this on your chest ten
minutes before lovemaking.

219
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,570
It may burn. Ignore it.

220
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,230
And this on his...

221
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,880
well,you know.

222
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,630
When you detect interest.

223
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,940
After... lie absolutely
still for an hour,

224
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,500
and then take two of these.

225
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,580
No,not these.

226
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,360
These were in the wrong cabinet.

227
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,770
Never touch these.

228
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,370
Excuse me.

229
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,130
I need to speak with my queen.

230
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,160
Privately.

231
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,690
Yes,of course.

232
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,300
What's wrong?

233
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,720
I was with the duchess in my chambers.

234
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,890
As we were...

235
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,550
engaged in conversation,we
happened to move...

236
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,370
close to the window and...

237
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,860
And what?

238
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,410
She caught cold?

239
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,280
She fell.

240
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,290
To her death.

241
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,320
My God. Henry!

242
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,430
We're trying to avoid
a war with these people.

243
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,740
- Does the archduke know?
- Not yet.

244
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,260
Why are you coming to me?

245
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,740
Shouldn't you be crafting
strategy with your advisors?

246
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,710
I can't trust them. What if they use
this against me? And this could mean war.

247
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,750
Yes,it could.

248
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,890
And no one knows how to cover
up a problem better than you.

249
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,260
You are my...

250
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,570
you are France's best hope.

251
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,630
Forget France.

252
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,290
Oh,you just want me to
have blood on my hands,too.

253
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,420
A way to keep me silent.

254
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,140
It's a practical solution.

255
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,680
For you. What's in it for me?

256
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,710
I want Chenonceau.

257
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,090
I gave that to Diane.You
want me to take back a gift?

258
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,760
She loves that ch‚teau.

259
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,820
Bring your mistress back to court,then,

260
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,590
and let her deal with your dead duchess.

261
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,930
Let her aid in moving a
body and crafting a story...

262
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,470
Very well. Chenonceau.

263
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,840
But no one else can know.

264
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,520
Only the two of us. No
servants,no... trusted advisors.

265
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,150
Don't try to school
a professional,Henry.

266
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,760
Lola,I think we need to talk about
your liaison with Francis in Paris.

267
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,180
Kenna,I can't do this right now.

268
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,590
Because you're tired.
You've been tired a lot.

269
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,270
You're pale,you're not
eating,your new gown doesn't fit.

270
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,090
You acted so strangely when
you were at home with Francis.

271
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,280
You're pregnant,aren't you?

272
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,540
Fast work.Well done!

273
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,010
There is no better way for a
royal mistress to secure her place.

274
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,160
Look at Diane.

275
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,110
If I could have managed it,but the king
is well versed in avoiding such issues.

276
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,480
Don't congratulate me.

277
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,610
I'm not Francis's mistress.

278
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,820
It was one night.

279
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,250
A... a moment of comfort.

280
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,100
Do you have any idea how this
will shame my family in Scotland?

281
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,840
And what will it do to Mary?

282
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,390
I understand that you're worried.

283
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,070
Mary won't take it well,not at first.

284
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,160
But think of it... in
time,she'll recover,

285
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,930
and Francis will be a loving father.

286
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,920
He'd want the child to grow up
here,and he'd probably let you raise it.

287
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,700
Let me? I'm the child's mother.

288
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,760
Yes,well,I'm sure that
you would play some part.

289
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,320
As long as you don't anger Mary
and you keep Francis's interest.

290
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,120
Regardless,Lola,your position at
French court is assured for life.

291
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,470
For life?

292
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,110
But as what?

293
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,810
- Kenna,I can't do this.
- What are you saying?

294
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,460
There are people who help
women who don't want babies.

295
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,000
Everyone knows they exist.
I... I just don't know any.

296
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,570
Did you... have you ever...

297
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,810
Ended a pregnancy? No.

298
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,570
The king is well stocked
to avoid such issues.

299
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,700
Well stocked with...?

300
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,910
Well,he covers... it...

301
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,460
If you don't know,you
shouldn't be having sex!

302
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,340
All right. Uh...

303
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,820
one of the servants... a
girl who washes my things...

304
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,220
she isn't married,but she seemed
to be with child a few months ago.

305
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,800
She disappeared for a few days,

306
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,090
and when she came back,she
was thinner,less troubled.

307
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,900
Who is she?

308
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,390
Tell me,please.

309
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,450
Bash.

310
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,300
You're supposed to be in Spain.

311
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,720
I'm supposed to be dead.

312
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,190
The night Francis's men were
escorting me out of the country,

313
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,620
they tried to kill me...
on his orders,I believe.

314
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,650
Oh,Francis wouldn't... you know that.

315
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,040
Really? After we put him through
hell,dispossessed him of everything?

316
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,440
After he saw our feelings for
each other when he returned?

317
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,230
After he stopped our marriage?

318
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,110
He still values you as his brother.

319
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,520
I am nothing to him.

320
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,870
Nothing but a threat.

321
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,310
He made that very clear.

322
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,720
Well,you're married now.

323
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,160
All of that is behind
us,all of that pain.

324
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,580
Was it only pain we left behind?

325
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,870
There was something more between us.

326
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,170
Francis knows that; he hates it.

327
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,850
He's come to hate me.

328
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,430
He still wouldn't have you killed.

329
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,140
Not in a flash of anger? Of jealousy?

330
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,330
That's all it would have taken...

331
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,190
a wave of the future king's
head,a nod to some guards,

332
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,390
and his intent,however fleeting,would
have resulted in my death.

333
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,300
Don't you want to know the truth?

334
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,510
No proof,one way or the
other,would change anything.

335
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,220
It might change your heart.

336
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,170
And it would change Francis's life,

337
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,530
because if I learn that
he did try to kill me,

338
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,290
I will take him down myself.

339
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,880
Bash,watch your words!

340
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,100
This threat alone could
result in your death.

341
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,070
Francis is my husband.

342
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,890
For your own sake,for your own doubt,

343
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,980
find out who you're married to.

344
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,730
If you need me,put a
light in your window,

345
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,150
and I'll meet you in the woods...

346
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,220
where we first kissed.

347
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,950
It's leaving a stain.

348
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,150
Why is this so difficult?

349
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,980
Our clothes go away dirty and they
come back clean...how do they do it?

350
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,750
I don't know.

351
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,610
They take them to the laundry,and...

352
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,650
they dip them in something.

353
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,410
Oh. Be sure to pick
up all the solid bits.

354
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,770
If we're lucky,it'll
look like spilled wine.

355
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,490
Roll it forward.

356
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,670
The way my chefs do stuffed pastry.

357
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,890
Now... there.

358
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,130
Now,all we have to do is get
her back to her chambers,and...

359
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,670
toss her out of the proper window.

360
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,230
Oh,this was my favorite coverlet.

361
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,390
Add it to the list of my debts to you.

362
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,780
- You're mistaken,my lady,I never...
- Please.

363
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,410
My friend needs your compassion.

364
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,610
It's dangerous,casting off a babe.

365
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,930
I understand.

366
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,580
No. Truly dangerous.Not
just to your reputation.

367
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,700
I was warned many girls don't survive.

368
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,080
You did.

369
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,210
You look healthy.

370
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,530
I was lucky.

371
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,750
I'd never have done it if
I hadn't been desperate.

372
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,450
Tell me where you went.

373
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,530
My friend is desperate,too.

374
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,340
My lady,we both know there's no friend.

375
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,040
If I tell you,if you never come back...

376
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,910
This could keep my family for months.

377
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,600
My lady,it's wrong to tempt
me to do what could harm you.

378
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,790
If there is harm,let it be on me.

379
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:00,750
I know,I know.She's...
heavier than she looked.

380
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,470
Nostradamus?

381
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,660
Are you here?

382
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,950
Wake up,my child. Wake up.

383
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,920
Wake up. I dismiss the demons
that trouble your sleep.

384
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,230
Wait until you hear the conversation
I had with your mother today.

385
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,190
I'd rather hear about the
conversation you had with my guards.

386
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,950
You wanted to know my
orders for Bash's departure.

387
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,890
I knew that you would hear about that.

388
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,450
I'm sorry,but I... I have to ask you,

389
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,510
did you order your guards to kill Bash?

390
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,070
Who put this idea into your head?

391
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,580
Bash believes it was your doing.

392
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,980
He was here?

393
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,950
- Where?
- In this room.

394
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,270
- Your bedchambers.
- Francis,please don't do this.

395
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,900
I didn't ask him to come to me.

396
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,320
So that's why you've been asking
questions,because he told you to?

397
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,560
Because I wanted to prove him wrong.

398
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,230
Francis,for God's sake,

399
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,390
doesn't it trouble you
that your brother thinks

400
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,810
that you tried to have him killed?

401
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,930
It troubles me more that you've
been wondering if he was right.

402
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,550
I could give you the name of the
ship that Bash was to sail on,

403
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,520
show you the captain. Does it matter?

404
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,390
I am the crown prince of France.

405
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,980
I can create evidence if I wish.

406
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,540
The more important question
is: will you take me at my word?

407
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,760
You came to me once,accusing my
mother of plotting against you.

408
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,610
You hadn't a shred of
proof,but I believed you.

409
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,960
We are royals.We have the
power to do terrible things.

410
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,140
Without trust,we're nothing.

411
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,090
- This is true of you and Bash as well. Trust...
- How can I trust him?

412
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,080
He killed a man in the woods for you.

413
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,550
And now these guards. He...

414
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,820
What,does he say he killed
them in self-defense?

415
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,910
I think it was to remain close to you.

416
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,620
- Francis...
- I didn't order anyone to kill him,

417
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,590
but I can promise you
he's not safe from me.

418
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,690
You can tell him yourself
when he comes here again,

419
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,860
as I'm sure he will.

420
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,150
"To Ferdinand,my dearest brother..."

421
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,210
"Dearest"? How many
brothers did she have?

422
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,750
"My darling brother Ferdinand,

423
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,330
Tonight,I end my life willingly."

424
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,580
Mention her fondness for France...

425
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,290
its culture and beauty.

426
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,280
It's a suicide letter,not
an enticement to pilgrims.

427
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,270
Why did she jump? We need a reason.

428
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,380
She was lonely.

429
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,860
What does a woman in her
position have to be lonely about?

430
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,520
That's ridiculous.

431
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,220
You try,then.

432
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,690
The man she loved was...

433
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,650
someone she could never have.

434
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,770
Poor girl.

435
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,780
Describe him as...

436
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,650
ruggedly handsome,with the...

437
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,380
sexual prowess of a lion.

438
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,150
Oh,you were serious.

439
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,590
Ever since you kissed my cheek,

440
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,230
I've been wondering what it would
be like to be kissed on the lips.

441
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,840
Are you sure you're ready?

442
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,110
There.

443
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:52,420
Now even the dimmest
of servants can find it.

444
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,770
She deserved a better end.

445
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,240
Don't we all.

446
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,900
You kiss like the French.

447
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,310
Well,we are in France.

448
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,810
I mean,you are positively
fluent in the language of love.

449
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,740
Beginner's luck?

450
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:37,200
I'm sure your natural abilities
would flourish in Bohemia.

451
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,020
Someone fell from the room above!

452
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,010
Cecilia's in that room!

453
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,760
W... wait!Uh,you were...

454
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,420
saying something about me and Bohemia.

455
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,760
- Not now!
- Wait!

456
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,100
Could she have had worse timing?

457
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,450
He was just about to propose to me.

458
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,300
I'm sorry,Your Grace,the
Lady Lola's not here.

459
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,930
At this hour?

460
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,120
We're supposed to meet the king
and queen in the throne room

461
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,900
to pay our respects to the
archduke in his bereavement.

462
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,000
She hurried out early.
She was dressed for riding

463
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,680
- and wouldn't say where she was going.
- Oh,no.

464
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,620
Do you know where Lola is?

465
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,940
Did you expect this to be easy?

466
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,620
Think hard before we begin.

467
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,290
I can give you a bit of leather
to bite on when you need to scream.

468
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,930
I would never ask this
of you,but I need to get

469
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,250
through the Blood Wood to
Lola before it's too late.

470
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,060
I can't believe she'd do
something so dangerous.

471
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,760
We all get desperate at times.

472
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,170
Bash,there's something
else.When we get to the place,

473
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,050
let me go in alone.

474
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,330
I don't want her to feel
embarrassed or shamed.

475
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,940
Follow my lead.

476
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,360
- I'll do the talking.
- Of course.

477
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,240
You've handled everything
brilliantly so far.

478
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,740
Your Majesties,excuse me,

479
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,750
but there's something you need to know.

480
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,510
One of my patients,not fully
in control of their faculties,

481
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:35,600
lashed out and... stabbed Father
Leduc with his own crucifix.

482
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,550
He's dead.

483
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,790
That's awful.

484
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,080
But not now.

485
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,530
"The looks of a Greek
god,the might of a lion"?

486
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,430
She didn't write this.

487
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,670
I know it's hard to see
someone in your family

488
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,030
as capable of such passion.

489
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,510
What she was incapable of was writing.

490
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,630
She never learned.

491
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,160
The note is a forgery.

492
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,270
I fear my dear sister was
the victim of foul play,

493
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,070
likely by someone inside the castle.

494
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,350
If that is the case,Bohemia
will have no choice but to...

495
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,690
You're right. It's forged.
And I know who was responsible.

496
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,570
The duchess's lover.

497
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,660
She had a lover?

498
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,860
I don't think we need to

499
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,050
sully the lady's memory
with tawdry details.

500
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,630
Henry,our dear guest deserves an
honest account of what happened.

501
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,170
Last night,I happened
to walk in on the duchess

502
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,900
while she was entwined
in the throes of passion

503
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,690
with a man she barely just met.

504
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,580
- My sister?
- I was shocked,I assure you,

505
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,830
but I had no intention of
gossiping about her indiscretion.

506
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,730
As my husband will attest,I'm
not a judgmental person.

507
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,490
- Henry?
- She's really not.

508
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,530
But...when news of
Cecilia's suicide erupted,

509
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,910
I was immediately
suspicious of this lover,

510
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,350
and I had him questioned under torture

511
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,580
until he revealed to me
the actual course of events.

512
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,250
And those were?

513
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,090
Well...

514
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,610
filled with remorse,Cecilia...

515
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,460
the chaste,pious royal that she was...

516
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,670
threw herself out of the window,

517
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,360
afraid of the shame that
this moment of weakness

518
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,990
would bring to your family.

519
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,060
Oh,my poor dear Cecilia.

520
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,890
And her lover,not wanting to
further your family's anguish,

521
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,180
wrote the note to protect their secret.

522
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,600
Making it appear that your sister's pain

523
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,250
was due to a...

524
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,450
much more palatable unrequited love.

525
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,780
Unrequited?

526
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,800
This note mentions sexual prowess!

527
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,400
I think that was just wishful thinking

528
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,910
on the part of the writer. Right,Henry?

529
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,790
So,her lover wrote the note

530
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,420
in an effort to protect her honor?

531
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,950
Ill-advised but gallant.

532
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,820
I want to see this lover.

533
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,030
The heart is a strange beast.

534
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,920
You tortured a man of the cloth?

535
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,030
We didn't know he was
a priest at the time.

536
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,800
He wasn't wearing his collar.

537
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,420
Or much of anything else.

538
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,710
And you killed him?

539
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,690
Unintentionally.

540
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,510
Sometimes...our interrogators
get a bit too energetic

541
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,600
when faced with a reluctant subject.

542
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,690
My sister.

543
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,830
I don't believe it.

544
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,480
I knew that once or twice
she had looked for consolation

545
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,260
in the arms of others,but...

546
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,930
such a scandal as this.

547
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,380
Can we just say that she drowned
accidentally in the river?

548
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,500
No mention of suicides
or old priests for lovers.

549
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,810
I know that I'm asking you to repeat
a falsehood,but I would be so grateful.

550
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,750
Well,don't... torment yourself,sir.

551
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,480
To maintain your friendship,

552
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,910
Catherine and I would go to any lengths.

553
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,380
Yes.

554
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,800
Lola?

555
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,870
Lola!

556
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,420
Lola!

557
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,230
- Are you all right?
- She's fine,my lady.

558
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,850
We've not yet begun.

559
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,140
Please leave us.

560
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,810
Come home with me.

561
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,080
This could kill you.

562
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,420
Mary,please,I can't.I have to do this.

563
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,770
If you knew the whole story...

564
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,750
It doesn't matter how it happened.

565
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,320
You're pregnant,and I understand.

566
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,400
It's not the end of the
world,not unless you make it so.

567
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,790
Let me help you.

568
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:55,270
Oh,if you... if you only knew.

569
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:07,040
When Francis returned from Paris...

570
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,930
you were at his side.

571
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,760
Is that my husband's child?

572
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,950
Yes.

573
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,070
She'll be all right.

574
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,050
I don't know what's
going to happen to her.

575
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,670
I don't know what's
going to h... happen.

576
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,480
I didn't put in that...that light
in the window because of Lola.

577
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,040
I talked to Francis.

578
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,270
And he managed to convince
you he was innocent

579
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,300
- of any attempt on my life.
- I believe him.

580
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,110
- Of course you do.
- Bash,stop this.

581
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,580
Look at you two,at each other's throats.

582
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,050
Well,my part in this
has ended. I am married.

583
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,910
You want me to leave.

584
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,490
- There is nothing for you here.
- You're here!

585
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,710
You need protection from them.

586
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,150
You must trust me on this.

587
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,140
They will always put their
interests above yours.

588
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,980
You offer me so much that I
cannot accept,because I am wed.

589
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,480
You cannot care for me.

590
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,960
In any way. Do you understand?

591
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,960
If you must hate someone...

592
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,340
please,hate me.

593
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,240
If I were capable of that,I would.

594
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,690
I'd forgotten what it was like

595
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,620
working with you instead of against you.

596
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,900
You're very charming,

597
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,170
when you're not trying to kill me.

598
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,290
I mean it. There is no one like you.

599
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,530
You're a galleon in full
sail,all guns blazing.

600
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,600
High on the waves.I remember.

601
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,710
It's still true.

602
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,890
You make other women tame.

603
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,990
Stay with me.

604
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,460
Henry.

605
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,070
Don't ruin it.

606
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,680
I'm sorry.

607
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,050
That you slept with my husband
or that you're pregnant?

608
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,540
Mary,you were engaged to Bash.

609
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,370
Francis thought he'd
never see you again.

610
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,130
I... I thought you'd
never see him again.

611
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,420
But I would see you!

612
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,690
You were my friend,

613
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:34,560
not to mention my lady,and you
knew that I loved him still.

614
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,680
I'm sorry.

615
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,910
I'm so sorry.

616
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,440
Does Francis know that you're pregnant?

617
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,630
No. And he can't.

618
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,370
Well,he'll know soon
enough. You'll start to show.

619
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,790
Not for some weeks.

620
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,620
Months. A... and by then...

621
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,130
- What?
- I don't know.

622
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:00,060
But all I ask is that you give
me time to sort my options out.

623
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,780
If you tell Francis I
am carrying his child,

624
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,580
I essentially become his.

625
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,830
I become nothing more than the
woman bearing a royal's child or...

626
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,210
Or his mistress.

627
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,540
And that's not an option.

628
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,220
For any of us,I assure you.

629
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,860
This will forever change my life,but
it doesn't have to change yours,

630
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,430
if you keep it a secret.

631
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,710
From my husband?

632
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,530
That's what you're asking me?

633
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,040
Yes,that's what I'm asking.

634
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,420
Bash.

635
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,790
I caught the boar.

636
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,390
He fell in our pit.

637
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,140
You should've seen the
look on Carrick's face.

638
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,130
Congratulations.

639
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,300
Come and join us for dinner.

640
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,580
Actually,I'm... I'm leaving.

641
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,510
Leaving us?

642
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,040
Leaving France.

643
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,240
I came to say good-bye.

644
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,010
Good-bye?

645
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,460
That's not why you came.

646
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,030
Stay for supper.

647
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,330
And the night.

648
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,090
And me.

649
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,250
And leave tomorrow.

650
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,430
A mark of flowers,hmm?

651
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,960
I used to pick roses every morning.

652
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,480
They cut me to pieces,but I didn't care.

653
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,400
That's because they're beautiful.

654
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,000
Just like you.

655
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,300
So the archduke left without
so much as a good-bye.

656
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,090
His sister just died.

657
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,170
The man is overcome with grief.

658
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,120
She could have thrown herself
off of any precipice in Europe.

659
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,130
Why here?

660
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,750
Well,clearly the archduke is a fool.

661
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,310
There'll be other suitors.

662
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,860
I promise.

663
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,090
But...his departure means

664
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,040
you'll be staying in court longer.

665
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,010
And that means

666
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,070
we get to play.

667
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:33,390
Don't let go.

668
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,960
Do you remember...

669
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,200
last night,what you did?

670
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,260
Were you dreaming?

671
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,770
Frightened by a nightmare?

672
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,630
Why did you do it?

673
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,310
It's close.

674
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,820
What is?

675
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,630
The Darkness.

676
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,650
It's coming.

677
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,500
And it will take us all.

678
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:29,700
