1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,989
England are expected to bring James Anderson back into the side.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,989
Hello and welcome to our look ahead to what the the papers will be

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,989
With me are the political commentator Miranda Green

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,989
and the Daily Telegraph's chief political correspondent,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:40,989
Thank you for being the first paper reviewers of 2016. Setting the year

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,989
off on a good standard, I hope. We can look at the front pages.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,989
The FT's picture is of the shooting in Tel Aviv.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,989
They also feature President Obama's New Year's message and a claim

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,989
he is planning to bypass Congress to impose new controls on gun sales.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,989
Pope Francis at his New Year's Day mass dominates the front

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,989
It also reports on the potential for British troops to face criminal

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,989
charges over abuse and unlawful killing during the Iraq War.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,989
The Daily Mail has comments from the first wife of suspended

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,989
Simon Danczuk about the impact which the allegation that he sent

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,989
explicit messages to a 17-year-old is having on their family.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,989
"A student cheating crisis" is the headline on the Times.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,989
It says almost 50,000 students have been caught cheating

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,989
The I says Jeremy Corbyn must get 35% of the vote in next year's

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,989
elections if he's to avoid a coup from fellow party members.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,989
The Sun reports on a former EastEnders actress, Sian Blake,

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,989
who has been missing with her two young children for almost three

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,989
Government plans to double the fine for littering to ?150

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,989
And the Mirror has claims from a couple who say they missed

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,989
out on a ?35 million lottery jackpot, because of a mix-up

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:09,989
Welcome. Let's begin with the FT Weekend, a two-day paper, so plenty

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,989
of time for people to delve into this but a striking story on the

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,989
front page as President Obama enters his final 12 months in office. What

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,989
he has done is returned to an issue he has been vocal on before, which

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,989
is gun control, which in America is incredibly controversial. The

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,989
Republican party refuses to countenance control on who can buy

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,989
and keep weapons. Plenty of Democrats feel the same. Because of

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,989
the American system it is difficult to get legislation through and in

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,989
2013 they tried with a bipartisan Bill after the Newtown school

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,989
killings which was blocked in the Senate and President Obama is

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,989
determined to return to this is his last few months to try to introduce

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,989
a background check on who can buy guns. It is controversial and part

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,989
of the rise of Donald Trump, the phenomenon in the Republican

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,989
selection as to who will run against we think Hillary Clinton, is the

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,989
idea that America and President Obama do not understand each other

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,989
and so trying to take on America's love of guns is controversial. It

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,989
has legacy written all over it. His comments are so important. When the

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,989
most recent massacre happened he said the reporting and reaction is

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,989
routine and it must stop. He was so cross. He has woken up to the fact

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,989
the clock is ticking. When you read the detail, it says he has been

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,989
pushing hard for background checks on those buying guns and would like

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,989
them to be mandatory which Congress will not permit. The only power he

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,989
has is to expand regulations, for background checks on people selling

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,989
the guns. The wrong way round. It is a tiny step towards even having a

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,989
conversation on controlling who has the guns. It is interesting when you

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,989
talk to Americans about this, they will quote to you, very clear in

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,989
their minds, about the right to bear arms. When you look at the

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,989
Constitution, it is the right to bear arms as part of a well ordered

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,989
militia, presumably when there was no police force and presumably the

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,989
police force is armed. They reserve their right to have their cake and

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,989
eat it. Loretta Lynch, the scourge of Fifa. If anybody can do it,

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,989
perhaps she can. That is an interesting thought. We will find

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,989
out more on Monday. In the Times newspaper, and very intriguing

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,989
story. An interesting report from the special correspondent who has

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,989
done investigations and he says he has found 50 student is caught

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,989
cheating at British universities. Many more likely to cheat in exams

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,989
rather than coursework. The Times newspaper has done it in a measured

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,989
way, but it is alarming. Extraordinary these figures. You try

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,989
to get Freedom of Information on these figures but you have to go to

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,989
individual university groups and to pull them together in one go is

65
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,989
interesting. Students coming from outside the EU to British

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,989
universities are an important source of revenue. Our universities charge

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,989
extraordinary multiples of what British and EU students pay. Is

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,989
there a debate on whether the scale of fees foreign students pay,

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,989
significantly higher than paid by our student is, whether they create

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,989
an incentive for people to behave in a way they might not otherwise

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,989
behave. It is an interesting point. We are as the UK in competition with

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,989
other English-speaking nations to attract people to universities.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,989
Partly because we want the best people from around the world. We

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,989
want them to stay here and win Nobel prizes here! That they are a source

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,989
of revenue. In the detail of the story, which looks robust as an

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,989
investigation, there is an extraordinary one, five cases of

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,989
impersonation where students arrange for someone else to sit exams on

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,989
their behalf. Imagine getting someone else to turn up to suit your

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,989
Ph.D. . Less than 1% of those found guilty of misconduct. If you aren't

80
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,989
getting a lot of money from foreign students, you might not want to

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,989
chuck them out. Are they enforcing the rules properly? Presumably it

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,989
will raise questions they will have to answer about procedures, and for

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,989
the employers who might say, is that degree quite as good as I thought it

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,989
was? Colonel Gaddafi, something to do with his Ph.D. In the past... ? I

85
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,989
think there have been a lot of allegations that he is not with us

86
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,989
to offer a response, so perhaps we will move on to the I newspaper.

87
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,989
This man, almost the man of the year in terms of publicity in 2015,

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,989
Jeremy Corbyn. This is fascinating. You have written a piece for the

89
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,989
Guardian and about pantomime. I do not what -- know what character he

90
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,989
would be. Dick Whittington? The streets of London paved with

91
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,989
electoral gold? Jack the giant killer. This piece says Jeremy

92
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,989
Corbyn's team are letting it be known they think the benchmark for

93
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,989
success in the May elections is for Labour to get a 35% vote share,

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,989
which could lead to do with managing expectations as to what would allow

95
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,989
him to survive as leader. A lot of the backchat has been, will there be

96
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,989
a coup against Corbyn by the moderate wing of the party? We

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,989
expect Jeremy Corbyn in the next weeks to probably knife his Shadow

98
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,989
Cabinet who are not onside. The drama will not go away any time

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,989
soon. 35%, they are playing down arguably expectations. Roughly 2%

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,989
above the average they are polling at the moment. Local elections are

101
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,989
not the same thing but we will try to map this on to a figure for the

102
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,989
next general election. You mentioned reshuffle. What is your sense of

103
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,989
this? There has been debate about whether it would happen. We had it

104
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,989
with that stuff in one of the Labour whip saying it is time to deal with

105
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,989
these traitors. Others trying to slap him down. John Ashworth saying

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,989
he should not have said it. Nobody is saying whether the reshuffle is

107
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,989
taking place. They say it is a matter for the leader and we are

108
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,989
told it is next week. How far does it go, dealing with the 11 or so

109
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,989
members of his close group of Shadow Cabinet who voted against him on

110
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,989
Syria. What is the risk? It already is called among the media the

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,989
revenge reshuffle, which is a problem because everything he does

112
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,989
to assert his authority is seen as part of the ideological battle and

113
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,989
spirit within the party and it goes back to the phenomenon of someone

114
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,989
who rebelled against the previous Labour leaders over 500 times,

115
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,989
trying to impose stern party discipline. You remember this, I can

116
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,989
remember a former minister under John Major when I asked him about

117
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,989
Iain Duncan Smith's demand for loyalty, saying some expletive rich

118
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,989
responses about what he thought. Because he had been a serial rebel

119
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,989
and made John Major's life hell in that period. In the Independent

120
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,989
newspaper, this is serious. The striking photograph of Pope Francis

121
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,989
kissing a statue of baby Jesus on New Year's Day. What do you make of

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,989
this? The context, a rambling about human rights we are seeing at the

123
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,989
moment. They are concerned human rights laws are being used to

124
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,989
prosecute soldiers, British soldiers, in foreign battlefields

125
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,989
is. It is a great story. The reporter has found there could be as

126
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,989
many as 200 people unlawfully killed by British soldiers. It puts it into

127
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,989
context, if you are trying to defend, and thinking about if you

128
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,989
will be sued at the end of that, it conflicts the idea of your job. The

129
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,989
legacy of Iraq is very much with us, domestically also. I agree. We are

130
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,989
waiting for pitch Chilcot report. Which we are told we will get this

131
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,989
summer. I hate to say, let's wait and see. -- for the Chilcot report.

132
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,989
The legacy of Iraq continues to haunt British politics. I am struck

133
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,989
by the idea that the caseload of the group looking into unlawful killing

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,989
and torture by British troops in Iraq is exploding. They were

135
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,989
investigating 152 cases and it has swollen to 1500 potential victims of

136
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,989
British troops behaving in a way against the laws of war, allegedly.

137
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,989
We will hear more about this in the course of the coming months. I will

138
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,989
let Christopher start again. I should do with this next one. A drum

139
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:55,989
roll. The front of the Daily Telegraph. War declared on litter

140
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,989
louts by one Christopher hope. It is a consultation from the government

141
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,989
to increase on the spot litter fine. -- finds. It is something that

142
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,989
annoys our readers. And probably a lot of other people. Some would say,

143
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,989
about time. Also interviewed, a man who is running a clean the country

144
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,989
for the Queen ahead of her 90th birthday and he is concerned that

145
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,989
some people think it is a human rights to drop litter. I trace it

146
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,989
back to when Vince were removed from London underground. An

147
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:55,989
anti-terrorism strategy. After the King's Cross could be right. --

148
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,989
Kings crossfire. You could be right. It is said we should police it. He

149
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,989
is saying... How do you go to someone and say you have dropped a

150
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,989
cigarette packet. Do it with politeness, he says, oh, you have

151
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,989
dropped something stop hopefully you will embarrass them into doing

152
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,989
something. The government is interested in this and it thinks it

153
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,989
has done it with the supermarket levy. And also sending text messages

154
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,989
to tell people neighbours had paid up, creating the sense you should

155
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,989
play along. Neighbours have picked up their litter and so maybe you

156
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,989
should. This person, a great wit, talks about why everybody should

157
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,989
have to live in a teenager's bedroom, it is bad for your spirit.

158
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,989
He is right. Interesting you have an American talking about it because

159
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,989
Bill Bryson is obsessed with the way we British do not look after our

160
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,989
country and drop litter. If they say we could improve, we should listen.

161
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,989
Let me give you the last story from this review. The front page of the

162
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,989
Mirror newspaper. We will leave the free slimming pull-out aside. The

163
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,989
story at the bottom. This couple say something went wrong with their

164
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,989
mobile phone app with which they bought their tickets, which would

165
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,989
have been a winning ticket and they would have been able to claim ?35

166
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,989
million. Clearly that is not a brilliant start to the new year for

167
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,989
them, thinking what might have been. I am interested in why it is the

168
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,989
splash and the psychology of it. You will you did to the slimming

169
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,989
pull-out and every single front page has a diet, turn over a new leaf

170
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,989
from page. What is the psychology of this? Are we supposed to think we

171
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:15,989
feel bad for them, or that our New Year will be more cheery? Buy a

172
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,989
paper ticket, that is what I say. I do notice... We do not have the

173
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,989
whole story yet, and I might be unfair to the couple, but they say

174
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,989
the ?2 online ticket purchase failed because they only had 60p in their

175
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,989
recount. That might not be the fault of the app! It could happen to any

176
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,989
of us. We have all thing when we thought we had sorted something.

177
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,989
Misreading the numbers and thinking you have one! It cannot be all of 35

178
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,989
million. It must be a share of that. That is something I cannot answer.

179
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,989
Perhaps we will have more when we come back in an hour. Thank you for

180
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,989
racing through a busy run of stories in the first paper review of 2016.

181
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Now, the sport.
