{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know what you are.

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,310
那你应该明白为什么你最好别回头
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So then you understand why it'd be best to never look back.

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,570
你像利用你生活中其他人一样在利用我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're using us just like you use everybody in your life!

侦币将何时发布
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And when is that gonna be?

26
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,800
你是打算尽快发布还是...

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,190
我们仍在不同平台进行测试
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, we're still testing the beta on different platforms,

28
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,720
确认适用网络  以及其他必要准备
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}we're finding our network, all the necessary bits and pieces.

29
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,030
我们不想操之过急
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We don't want to rush it, obviously,

确实如此
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, it certainly seems that way.

34
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,010
你能不能给我做个讲解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you could, go ahead and explain this to me,

和贝宝一样吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is it like a PayPal?

你觉得有什么区别

41
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,580
贝宝是电子支付交易系统
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, PayPal is a digital payment system.

42
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,000

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's not its own currency.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}which legally makes him

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,720
他能让侦币变成现实

95
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,250
最好是这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll bet you he do.

96
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,500
等等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey, hold up, though.

97
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,320
这里好像只有30万
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This seem like only about 300 in here.

98
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,790
说好的是45万
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know it 'posed to be 450.

99
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,170
公司没批准我们提那么多钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We were unable to get that amount approved.

100
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,120
你确定要搞成这样吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you sure you want it to go down like this?

101
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,780
理解一下  罗  侦币
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Try to understand, Ron. GenCoin...

102
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,890
我只知道你们钱没带够
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I understand that you short.

103
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,360
这就是我的理解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's what I understand.

104
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,530
你可以打给你的律师
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're welcome to call your lawyer.

105
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,970
不然就只好这样了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Otherwise, I'd let this one be.

106
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,070
真棒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bravo!

107
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,660
不好意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Permiso.

108
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,010
你在看守这些宝贝吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you guarding the stash?

109
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,080
你是伊莎贝尔吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Isabelita, huh?

110
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,090
你妈安排得真好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What a job your mom did.

111
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,870
肯定一大堆事要处理吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Must have been a lot of chaos around here.

112
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,210
-是啊  -我了解马塔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Yeah. - I know Marta. I know her.

113
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,060
她对这场婚礼很上心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, she...she took it very seriously.

114
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,340
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah.

115
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,420
最近怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How have you been?

116
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,170
你从加利福尼亚来这里后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I feel like I didn't see you since you came from...

117
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,930
我就没见过你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}California, right?

118
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,120
一直在弄新东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just workin' on new stuff.

119
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,650
什么"新东西"  什么"新东西"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Como que "New stuff"? Como que "New stuff"?

120
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,950
亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Aye, mi amor.

121
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,550
你爸说你自己开了公司
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your dad told me that you start your own company!

122
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,730
什么科技公司  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Something about tech, right?

123
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,540
他说你有间高档
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, yes, he told me you have a big,

124
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,460
宽敞的办公室  应有尽有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}fancy office and everything.

125
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,880
我要把这瓶酒...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm gonna go take this...

126
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,250
拿给你男友吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}To your boyfriend?

127
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,770
一会见...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I will meet...

128
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,890
你又要偷藏老爸的啤酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You stashing Papi's beer again?

129
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,570
不  我只是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I just...

130
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,620
想自己待会儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}needed a minute.

131
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,190
我们马上要切蛋糕了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We're cutting the cake in a bit though, all right?

132
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,770
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah.

133
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,250
我马上过去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll be there.

134
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,830
戴尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Delly?

135
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,300
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah?

136
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,670
你真漂亮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You look beautiful.

137
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,090
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know.

138
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,840
你要记得锁侧门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You should try locking the side gate.

139
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,020
你怎么不走前门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's wrong with the front door?

140
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,680
我觉得你不会开门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't think you would open.

141
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,040
我...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I, uh...

142
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,870
有些话要说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have some things I need to say.

143
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,080
我要解释一下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need to explain myself.

144
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,040
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yeah?

145
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,360
对不起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry.

146
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,280
好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay? Um...

147
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,250
对不起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry.

148
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,130
真好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Great.

149
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,440
道个歉没事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Everything's better then.

150
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,260
听我解释
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let me explain myself.

151
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,360
我知道你要说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think you know what you're gonna say.

152
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
我也被踢出来了  尼克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I got pushed out too, Nick.

153
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,870
我被洗出局了  我完了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm out of my own thing. I'm done.

154
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,660
他拉了一个第三方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He brought in a third partner.

155
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,150
是个服务器群组
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This, uh, server farm.

156
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,990
一家网络管理公司
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A network management company.

157
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,170
结果公司也是他的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It turns out that he owns it, too.

158
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,280
他就占了多数股份
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Which makes him a majority,

159
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,300
然后直接投票把我踢出了公司
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}then he single-handedly voted me out.

160
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,120
律师说这叫恶意收购
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The lawyers called it a hostile takeover.

161
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,890
是有这种东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, it's a thing.

162
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,740
我的代码被他强占了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He owns my code.

163
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,880
侦币
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}GenCoin.

164
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,760
我毕生心血就这么归他了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My life's work, it's his just like that.

165
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,350
太惨了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, that sucks.

166
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,080
是啊  总之...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Anyway...

167
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,500
总之你现在道歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, anyway, now you're sorry,

168
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,380
是因为你一无所有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}'cause you've got nothing.

169
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,870
我劝过他让你们回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I tried to bring you guys back in.

170
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,900
我尽力了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I tried.

171
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,810
但你也知道  当时一团糟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But everything was a mess and you know that.

172
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,890
我束手无策
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't know what to do.

173
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,670
我只是想让侦币变成现实
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just wanted GenCoin to work.

174
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,880
我只在乎这件事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's all I cared about.

175
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,730
这比你  我  罗尼都重要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It was bigger than you or me or Ronnie or...

176
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,220
好了  希望说完这些你能好受点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, I hope that makes you feel better.

177
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,530
我送你出去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let me show you the front door.

178
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,580
如果你之前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe if you wouldn't

179
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,740
不把我当成疯子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}have treated me like a fucking crazy person,

180
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,860
-尊重我一些  -你就是个疯子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- and had some respect for me. - You are a fucking crazy person!

181
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,740
你不了解我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't know me!

182
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,410
你知道你疯了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know you're fucking crazy!

183
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,930
你什么都不明白  为什么呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't know nothing. You know why?

184
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,650
因为你什么都不缺
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't know because you have all of this.

185
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,270
你也不了解我  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't know me either, all right?

186
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,970
-说话注意点  -有钱白人的通病
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- So watch what you say. - Rich white people problems!

187
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,210
你不了解我  也不了解我的经历
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't know me and you don't know what I've been through.

188
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,060
你也不知道我的经历
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You have no idea what I've been through.

189
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,160
好可怜哦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Boo fucking hoo.

190
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,370
你老爸不要你了

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Don't fucking say that. Don't fucking say that. - What's wrong?

192
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,280
我们互相都不了解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know you, you don't know me,

193
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,100
我不知道你脑子里...

你怎么能让那贱人这么耍你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why you let that bitch play you like that?

205
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,440

208
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,580
这事没那么简单
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's complicated.

209
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,580
我就说这么多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's all I'll say.

210

212
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,720

214
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,850

00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,470
爸  随便吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, Pap. Whatever.

219
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,520
别跟我说"随便"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't "Whatever" me.

220
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,710
好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right?

223
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,180
你要知道大丈夫...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You gotta know when to be the man...

你就该把他们全杀了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Should have murked them all.

227
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,480

-我知道  -太扯了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I know. - It's ridiculous right here.

258
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,460
你来这里就很扯  你心里清楚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You being here. You know what you did.

259
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,640
-尼克  把话讲清楚  -抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Come on now, Nick. You got some explaining to do. - I'm sorry.

260
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,460
不用他解释
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He doesn't have to explain anything.

261
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,580
我很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry.

262
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,750
我为我的所作所为道歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am sorry for what I did,

263
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,900
我知道一句"抱歉"不能了事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and "Sorry" doesn't cut it,

264
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,920
我知道  但是除了抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I know that, but I have no other words

265
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,940
我不知道还能说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}other than "I am sorry."

266
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,400
我们才是侦币的核心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This right here is GenCoin.

267
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,680
没有你们就没有侦币
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's no GenCoin without you.

268
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,120
我们有个夺回公司的计划
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We had a plan to get the company back.

269
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,590
你想加入吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You want in?

老天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, Jesus Christ.

272
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,190
喂  你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello. Hello.

274
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,970
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}'Kay.

275
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,180
我把伊甸田的时间改到了十一点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I moved Eden Field to 11:00,

276
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,400
你可以多休息会儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so you could get some rest.

277
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,930
我没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm fine.

278
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,990
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

279
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,360
这是大势所趋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It had to happen.

280
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,700
我们给过她机会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We gave her fair chance.

281
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,080
有些狗拴不住
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Some dogs can't be chained.

282
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,730
她会咬伤我们所有人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She would have bitten us all.

283
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,320
也许只是你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe just you.

284
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,680
薇拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Vera?

285
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,410
侦币不能落得跟其他项目一个下场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}GenCoin can't wind up like the others.

286
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,050
不会的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It won't.

287
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,460
就是这位老兄偷了咱们的钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So this the little nigga who took our cash.

288
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,160
这是亚历克斯所有空壳公司的产权史
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Chain of title for all of Alex's shells.

289
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,380
还有02年起他赚的  花的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Plus, a paper trail for every single dollar

290
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,320
或者投资的书面记录
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that he's made, spent, or invested since 2002.

291
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,000
她把他大学的色情网站账户都黑了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She even hacked all his porn accounts from college.

292
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,250
那就是图个开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That was just for fun.

293
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,710
干得漂亮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nice work.

294
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
你怎么拿到的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How'd you get it?

295
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,680
你来找我们前  我就把他给黑了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I hacked his shit way before you came to us.

296
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,210
这妹子不轻信别人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Our girl got trust issues.

297
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,110
那你们的条件呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So... what's the catch?

298
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,390
条件...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The catch...

299
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,530
就是不能用这个勒索他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}is that you're not gonna use that to blackmail him.

300
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,610
你...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You...

301
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,680
要替我们办事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}work for us now.

302
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,740
你要用这些把他打垮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're gonna use it to bring him down

303
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,310
而且不能让我们触犯法律
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}without implicating us in any legal activity.

304
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,600
你们还没弄清情况吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't think you understand how this works.

305
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,030
-是吗  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- We don't? - No.

306
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:01,130
罗尼  我们没弄清吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Ronnie, do... do we not know how this works?

307
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,590
妹子  我也说不好啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shit, girl. I don't know. I don't know, man.

308
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,890
我们是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are we just...

309
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,630
这事他说了算吗  尼克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Does he got the drop on us, Nick?

310
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,150
难说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, it's tough to say.

311
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,130
非常难
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Super hard.

312
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,650
准备好就说一声
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let me know when you're ready. I'll press play.

313
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,610
这是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What is that?

314
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,270
戴耳机  听听看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Listen. Put it on.

315
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,160
为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why?

316
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,220
你先听完再说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why don't you listen and then we'll talk?

317
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,620
赶紧把录音听了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just listen to the motherfucking tape.

318
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,880
这是你们的样带吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This your demo?

319
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,350
请吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, please.

320
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,530
-什么  -你把那姑娘杀了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I'm sorry? - You kill the girl yet?

321
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,620
你说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

322
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,650
你把那姑娘杀了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You kill the girl yet?

323
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,130
你要是再敢问一遍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You ever ask me that again,

324
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,010
我就一枪毙了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm gonna put a bullet through your head.

325
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,740
别再问我这个问题了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't want you asking me that again.

326
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,780
-她看到我了  -我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- She saw me. - Yeah, I know.

327
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,820
她看到了这个  也看到了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She see this. She see you.

328
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,190
我知道  你是个天才
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, yeah, I know. I know. You're a genius.

329
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,420
那烂摊子交给我  行吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You let me deal with that, all right?

330
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,440
你帮我把钱拿到就好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You deal with getting me my fucking money.

331
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,660
我们应该很快就要扩大团队规模
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We're gonna probably need to scale up the team pretty soon.

332
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,270
至少还要两人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I want at least two new people

333
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,090
专门负责管理双端网络
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}who are solely dedicated to interfacing with Mimi

334
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,870
与米蜜进行对接
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}about network management on both ends.

335
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,880
我认识个本地工作的人  想见见吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have a guy who's based here if you want to meet him.

336
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,340
他经常去奥斯汀出差
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He flies back and forth to Austin,

337
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,880
所以在伊甸田有些熟人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so he knows some of the Eden Field people already.

338
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,830
我想尽快跟他见面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd love to meet him as soon as possible.

339
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,090
你仍然想在二号发布吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you still aiming to launch on the second?

340
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,090
最好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Ideally.

341
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,390
但测试版还没在全平台通过检测
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But the beta hasn't been proven across all platforms yet,

342
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,320
-我还... -会成功的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- and I still... - It'll work.

343
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,880
我们会测试  会成功的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We'll test it, and it'll work.

344
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,990
二号发布没问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So we can launch on the second.

345
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,950
尼科说可以在二号发布
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, well, Nico says we can launch on the second.

346
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,640
如果我们在二号发布
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If we wanted to launch on the second,

347
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,210
我们能承受的日交易次数有多少
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}how many transactions per day do you think we'd be ready to host?

348
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,210
我们得加紧扩大规模
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, we'd have to scale up way quicker.

349
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,250
这不是不可能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Um, it's not impossible.

350
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,290
只是要多花钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just takes money.

351
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,030
我们有钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}'Kay, well, we have money.

352
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,420
抱歉各位  稍等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry, guys. Uh, one sec.

353
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,250
亚历克斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Alex.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Nice to meet you, Phil Rask. - You too.

357
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,380
回避一下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, if you could...

358
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,230
抱歉叨扰  我知道你很忙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Excuse the interruption. I know you're busy.

359
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,640
没关系
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, uh, no, it's okay.

360
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,770
薇拉问过你要来点...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can... uh, did Vera ask if you want...

361
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,400
问了  谢谢  我不喝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She did, thank you. Yeah, I'm fine.

362
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,680
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay then.

363
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,010
你有何...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What, uh...

364
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,840
有何贵干
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And how... how can I help?

365
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,820
我需要钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need money.

366

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know about Helsinki.

368
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,980
我...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I... I'm...

369
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,450
我不知道你在说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know what you're talking about.

370
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,530
别跟我装傻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't fuck with me.

371
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,120
我有四百多页文件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have over 400 pages of documents linking you

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have those.

375
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,050
不在金融犯罪执法网络
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not FinCEN.

376
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,130
也不在联调局或中情局
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not the FBI. Not the CIA.

377
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,110
就我一个人有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Me and me alone.

378
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,800
我不明白  你是在勒索...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't understand. Are you blackmail...

379

00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,510

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I let my sin define me,

476
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,370

478
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,870

479
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,170

480
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,060

486

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}they ain't always gonna be pretty.

487
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,360
事实上  有时很难看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hell, matter of fact, sometimes they gonna be ugly.

488
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,970

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's gonna be people gunning for us.

489
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,800

492
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,100
我说的这些人更可怕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Dawg, I'm talking a whole lot worse.

493
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,540
