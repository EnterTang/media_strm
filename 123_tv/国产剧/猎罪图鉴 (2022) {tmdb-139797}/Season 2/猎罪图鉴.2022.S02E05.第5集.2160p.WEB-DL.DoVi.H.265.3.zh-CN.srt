马普尔小姐探案
制作 Lyra

1
00:00:35,663 --> 00:00:38,604
1932年,烟囱大厦,晚宴

2
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:55,385
不,不,不,别去,别去
No, no, no. Please, please.

3
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:58,620
不,不.您不能往那边去,求您
No, no. You mustn't go in there, please, sir.

4
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,109
求您听我的
Now, listen to what I'm saying.

5
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,784
求您听我的,求您别过去
Please listen to me. No, please, please.

6
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:11,880
名苑猎凶

7
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:13,435
伦敦 蓓尔美尔街俱乐部 23年后

8
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:16,572
凯特勒姆,老伙计,我不该问
Caterham, my dear chap, I wouldn't ask,

9
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:20,328
只不过此事关系重大
only it's a matter of considerable national importance.

10
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:21,951
总是事关重大不是吗?
Isn't it always?

11
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:24,809
维也纳那边有了很大进展
We've had the most tremendous approach from Vienna.

12
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:25,619
继续说
Go on.

13
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,038
奥地利现在成了中立国
Now the Austrians are a nice neutral bunch,

14
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:30,031
他们很急切地想跟我们英国成为朋友
they're very keen to be friends with us Brits.

15
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:31,315
什么条件?
What's the offer?

16
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:33,451
铁矿石
Iron ore.

17
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:36,859
我们去帮助他们的重工业重整旗鼓
We go in, help them put their heavy industry back on its feet,

18
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,784
可以要多少铁矿拿多少
take home all the iron ore we need.

19
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:41,050
首相简直不敢相信会有这么好的买卖
The PM can scarcely believe his luck.

20
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,995
不管怎样,维也纳方面要派来一位公使
Anyway, Vienna's sending over an envoy.

21
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:44,704
路德维格伯爵
Count Ludwig.

22
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,472
我分到的任务是为伯爵安排住处,并且开始起草合约
I've been tasked with sitting the Count down, putting pen to paper

23
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:50,508
然后设法让他签字
and getting him to sign the contract.

24
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:53,328
得找个红花绿草,心旷神怡,最重要的是能谈事的地方
Somewhere green and pleasant and, above all, discreet.

25
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:56,010
你想让他住烟囱大厦?
And you thought of Chimneys?

26
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,386
嗯,你懂的,周末开个室内宴会
Well, you know, a weekend house party.

27
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:00,866
好酒好菜
Good food, decent cellar.

28
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:04,029
像以前那样,诶?你说怎么样?行吗?
Just like the old days, eh? What do you say? Do the ayes have it?

29
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:07,404
实际上,我下个月还想出去度假呢
Well, actually, I was thinking of going on holiday next month.

30
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:10,143
别瞎扯了,谁9月份出去度假啊
Oh, nonsense. Nobody goes on holiday in September.

31
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:13,157
再说,咱俩谁跟谁啊
Besides, we're practically family you and I.

32
00:02:13,157 --> 00:02:16,393
只等着你家女儿想通了
Once we bring that girl of yours to her senses.

33
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:21,893
我们家不如从前啦,房子有点失修
We're not as we were. The house is in some disrepair.

34
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:25,635
很好啊,有点沧桑感,增加几分情趣
Perfect. Faded grandeur. Adds to the flavour.

35
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,974
这事不能张扬出去
It'll need to be low-key.

36
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:31,448
那是自然的,只叫好朋友来,此事要谨慎处理
Indeed so. Intimate. Discreet.

37
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:34,402
选一两个"合适"的客人
One or two guests, sensitively chosen.

38
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:37,736
当然了,这些个欧洲人都是些势利眼
Of course, these continentals are such fearful snobs.

39
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:41,017
我会叫我最得力的手下去帮忙的
I'll send my best chap round to help with the setting up.

40
00:02:41,017 --> 00:02:43,445
比尔埃弗斯利,听候差遣
Bill Eversleigh. Yours to serve.

41
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,355
你好
How do you do?

42
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:50,936
为什么选择烟囱大厦?我们都很多年没举办宴会了
But why Chimneys? It's years since we gave a party.

43
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:53,752
几十年了,32年以后就没举办过
Decades. Not since '32.

44
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:55,349
给他看看那封信
Show him the letter.

45
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,285
哪封?   路德维格伯爵写的
The...?   From Count Ludwig.

46
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:05,886
你看
Here we are.

47
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:08,361
第四段
Fourth para.

48
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,306
从中间开始读
Halfway down.

49
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:14,298
我久仰烟囱大厦的大名,听说是英国老建筑里
I have heard that Chimneys is the most prized house...

50
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:15,884
最负盛名的
 ..in old England,

51
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:18,376
如果能瞻仰这座美丽的宫殿
and would count it a singular honour

52
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:22,104
将是鄙人的无上荣幸
to see that jewelled palace for myself.

53
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,587
这将成为我最想要珍藏的记忆
It is a memory I am most eager to cherish.

54
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,966
要是我吓着你了很抱歉
Sorry to drop in unannounced.

55
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:48,754
你要是合作我也会温柔一些
If you're gentle with me then I'll be gentle with you.

56
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:50,460
啊!
Agh!

57
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:55,478
救命!
Help!

58
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:15,278
永远,不要...
Never, ever...

59
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:19,095
碰我妈妈的自行车
..touch mother's bicycle again.

60
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,127
你没事吧?能站起来吗?
Are you all right? Can you stand?

61
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:25,309
哦,是的,我...   这是最主要的
Oh, yes, I...   Well, that's the main thing.

62
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:27,469
只要能站起来,一切就...
Once you're up on your pins, then life seems so...

63
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:32,154
皆有可能
Full of possibility.

64
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,893
没错
Indeed.

65
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:38,829
我倒不是只在乎我妈的自行车,你知道
Not that I was purely concerned about 

66
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,774
我倒不是只在乎我妈的自行车,你知道
poor mother's bicycle, you understand.

67
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:43,579
我希望不是
Well, I should hope not.

68
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:46,984
我想那家伙应该吸取教训了,你说呢?
I think the chap got the message, don't you?

69
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:55,036
他就这么铁马王子一般地冲出来救了我
And there he was, galloping in to save me on his iron horse.

70
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:58,043
真是世界上最二的骑士了
I mean it really was the most idiotically chivalrous...

71
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,273
怎么了?
What?

72
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:01,112
弗吉尼亚
Virginia.

73
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:04,451
你和你亲爱的妈妈一样是无可救药的浪漫主义者
You are as absurdly romantic as your dear mother.

74
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:05,569
哦,太没有呢
Oh, no. No, no, no.

75
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:08,000
你这话可说的不对.你要是真的觉得...
Woof woof. Wrong tree. If you honestly...

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,134
他是最不合适的人了
He couldn't be more unsuitable.

77
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:11,581
没钱没钱途
No cash, no prospects.

78
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:14,967
哦,如果是这样的话...   是啊,就是这样了
Oh, well, then.   Yes, quite. Case closed.

79
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:18,753
再者说了,他这周对我很冷淡
And, anyway, he's been quite standoffish with me this past week.

80
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:21,970
大概是觉得无聊了,你说呢?
I expect he's bored of me. Don't you?

81
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,177
哦,必须的.他叫什么?
Oh, yes. Does he have a name?

82
00:05:24,484 --> 00:05:28,976
安东尼凯德"阁下".不过是打引号的
Sir Anthony Cade. Only without the knighthood.

83
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:41,896
哦,天啊,我还想呢
Oh, dear. I was just thinking.

84
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:43,873
你那位可怜的国会议员
Your poor MP.

85
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:47,844
乔治洛马克斯可一刻不耽误
George Lomax won't be the least bit put off.

86
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,228
恰恰相反
On the contrary.

87
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:51,117
又给你下最后通牒了?
Not another ultimatum?

88
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:54,363
我要在周日晚上前答应做他太太
I have until Sunday night to consent to be Mrs George Lomax.

89
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:57,242
要不然呢?   他大概就要入侵波兰了
Or what?   He invades Poland, I suppose.

90
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,394
不管怎么说,他开的条件还是很好的
Anyway, the terms are most generous.

91
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:03,001
他会安排爸爸在镇上的豪宅住下
He'll put daddy up in a mansion flat in town,

92
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:05,424
这正合他心意,自从妈妈死了之后他一直想这样
which is all he wants since Mama passed away.

93
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:08,014
他还会出钱维持烟囱大厦
And he'll even pay to stop Chimneys from falling apart,

94
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:11,061
我想这对家族很好
which I suppose is jolly good for the family.

95
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:12,494
前提是你嫁给他
If you marry him.

96
00:06:13,477 --> 00:06:15,714
显然大家期望我会心怀感激
I should be more grateful, obviously.

97
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:21,474
我想感激大概不是一段幸福婚姻的基石
Well, I'm not sure gratitude is the basis for a happy marriage.

98
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,370
不过话说回来,这方面我没什么发言资格
Well, no, no. Not that I am any sort of expert.

99
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,994
哪的话,妈妈一直说你是她所有亲戚里最理智的了
No, no, no, no, Mummy always said

100
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:29,583
哪的话,妈妈一直说你是她所有亲戚里最理智的了
 you were the most eminently sensible of all her cousins.

101
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:34,309
她的婚姻是非常成功的
Well, she certainly made a splendid marriage.

102
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:37,850
要说幸福啊,本该很简单的不是吗?
It should be so simple, shouldn't it, being happy?

103
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,710
应该是一见倾心的,不是吗
I mean, one ought to see it, and just know.

104
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:44,424
现在你来了,我们要放纵一下
Well, now that I've got you here 

105
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:46,773
现在你来了,我们要放纵一下
we are going to have a riot, you and I.

106
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,708
这是我待字闺中的最后一个周末了
My last weekend as an eligible spinster.

107
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,756
你玩游戏吗?   我尽量吧
Are you game?   Well, I'll do my best.

108
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:56,460
好了!
Well!

109
00:06:58,608 --> 00:07:02,494
我来这里住你父亲没意见吗?
Are you quite sure it's all right with your father, having me along?

110
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:04,525
爸爸很高兴呢
Oh, Daddy's thrilled.

111
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,826
再说我也去圣玛丽米德做过客
And, anyway, you've had me down to St Mary Mead.

112
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,962
礼尚往来嘛
It's only fair I return the favour.

113
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,830
来,看.17页
Here, look. Page 17.

114
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:13,794
是不是个帅锅?
Isn't he a dish?

115
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:19,092
安东尼凯德
Anthony Cade.

116
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:21,534
一时兴起罢了
Some passing whim.

117
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:26,422
弗吉尼亚很纯真,很容易受触动.这也是她的魅力
Virginia is innocent, easily led. It's all part of her charm.

118
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:28,167
也许她只是玩玩罢了
Perhaps she's off for a bit of fun, sir.

119
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:31,816
我的好伙伴
My short trousers chum,

120
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:34,683
我们总得学会放下这些幼稚的东西
We must all learn to put away, childish things.

121
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,594
她不是把凯德也叫来了吧
I say she's not bringing Cade along, is she?

122
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:39,493
没有,先生.她带了一位马普尔小姐来
No, sir. She's coming with a Miss Marple.

123
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,384
我们认识这人吗?
Do we know her?

124
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:41,807
我想不认识
Not that I'm aware of.

125
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,766
我以为你核对过客人的名单了
I thought you were cross the guest list.

126
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,098
我核对过了,当然核对过了
Oh, I am, absolutely.

127
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:50,979
马普尔小姐,一听就是没见过世面的小姑娘
Marple, some fresh hatch little...

128
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:53,023
跟你很搭呢
Something for you obviously.

129
00:07:55,454 --> 00:08:01,343
至于弗吉尼亚,我希望你对她没什么念头
Regarding Virginia, I trust you have no ambition of your own.

130
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:04,272
哪会呀   因为你是没希望的
What's a question?   Because that wouldn't do at all.

131
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:08,210
我不想你受伤而已
One wouldn't want you to be hurt.

132
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:10,644
受伤的机会都没有,先生
No chance of that, sir.

133
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,311
什么事,柴德维尔?
Yes, Treadwell?

134
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:20,002
你的客人到了,先生
Your guest has arrived, sir.

135
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:21,175
这么快?
Already?

136
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:26,039
肩往后,关键时刻到了,学着点
Shoulders back. Cometh the hour. Watch and learn.

137
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:28,983
爵爷桌上的信
Letters for posting on his Lordship's table.

138
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:31,323
请您用快递寄出去
Send them express, if you'd be so kind.

139
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,095
路德维格伯爵,您好!
Count Ludwig!

140
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:42,910
瞧瞧
Oh, look.

141
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,042
他要亲上人家的屁股了
He's practically licking his shoes.

142
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:48,343
伯爵要以为这是英国的奇风异俗了
The Count might think it's some sort of quaint British custom.

143
00:08:53,822 --> 00:09:00,232
您的到来是我国的荣幸

144
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,505
有点早了,这样更好
A little early, but so much the better.

145
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:06,704
恰恰相反,我来的太晚了

146
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:11,758
是啊,这房子很美
Indeed, a lovely house, yes.

147
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:13,736
他像是上个世纪的人似的
He seems like he's from another age.

148
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:16,057
你说他能不能说英语啊
I wonder if he speaks any English.

149
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:18,783
签张支票需要会几句英语呀?
How much English do you need to sign a cheque?

150
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:22,404
我...金属...你...钞票大大地
Me metal. You big, big dollars.

151
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:29,457
玛德琳?
Madeleine?

152
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,787
爸爸,别傻了,我是弗吉尼亚啊
Don't embarress yourself, papa, it's Virginia.

153
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:37,991
是弗吉尼亚啊,我来看看你
Virginia. Pops in a visit.

154
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:40,538
是啊,我没听到你进来
Yes, I didn't hear you come in.

155
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:41,634
爸爸您好!
Hello Daddy!

156
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:44,052
真抱歉,亲爱的
So sorry, darling.

157
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:47,019
啊,亲爱的简
Ah, dear Jane.

158
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,293
克莱门特
Clement.

159
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:51,973
都有...多少年...   是啊,自从葬礼就没见了   是啊
It's been... Well...   Yes, not since the funeral.   Yes.

160
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,983
玛德琳死后你一直对我女儿这么好   惭愧
You've been so kind to my daughter since we lost Madeleine.   No.

161
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:57,995
你的花园怎么样了
How's your garden?

162
00:09:58,634 --> 00:10:00,966
不怎么繁茂啊
Hardly thriving, I'm afraid.

163
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:04,255
爸爸,你也整理一下自己的仪容啊
Daddy, you might have made a bit of an effort.

164
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:07,601
不用管我,我现在就是个怪老头了
Oh, pay no attention to me. I'm just the odd-job man these days.

165
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:11,927
哦,看啊,这不是那位国家遗产局的那个女人吗
Oh, look. I see you've invited that nice lady from National Heritage.

166
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,649
希尔达贝金索普?
Hilda Blenkinsopp?

167
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:19,305
不,不. 哦,不!
No. No. Oh, no!

168
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:23,376
班铎,别生气,她很想来这里
Now, Bundle, don't get cross. She was very keen to be invited...

169
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:24,846
我们说好不让她再来了
She's banned. We agreed.

170
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:28,628
对,但是国家遗产局出价很合适
Yes, but the National Heritage have made a very sensible offer.

171
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,804
烟囱大厦已经在这个家族传了几代人了,它就是这个家的一部分
Chimneys has been in the family for centuries. It is family.

172
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:35,024
没错亲爱的,但是我们已经负担不起了,这你知道的
Yes, but, darling, you know we can't afford to keep the place on.

173
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,491
我们会想办法的,我们总是能想到办法
We will manage. We always do.

174
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:43,269
她心情不错啊
Well, she's on good form.

175
00:10:44,996 --> 00:10:50,768
国家遗产局已经接手郡里13座老宅子了
National Heritage has taken on 13 homes and gardens in the county.

176
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:55,961
为贵族而建,为人民而维系
Built for the few, fit for the many, 

177
00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:58,203
我就是冲着这样的前景努力的   谢谢
that's the England I'm fighting for.   Thank you.

178
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:00,155
巫婆的计谋得逞了
The witch found who she want.

179
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:06,438
不管怎么说,你都想不到人们是怎么涌入这些个老房子的
Still, you'd be amazed how these old places fill up.

180
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:09,805
有钱人的旧宅,谁不想看看啊
Homes of the former great, draw such a crowd.

181
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,278
特别是到了周末
Especially at the weekends.

182
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:14,263
等我们把那块土地清理好
Once we get that patch sorted out.

183
00:11:14,263 --> 00:11:18,787
那块土地!这些花园是国王设计的
That patch! These gardens were designed by King.

184
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:22,245
是嘛,谁都有闲得没事的时候啊
Oh, well, dear, I suppose we all have our off days.

185
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,234
上流社会啊,埃弗斯利.我说什么来着!
High society, Eversleigh. What did I say?

186
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:26,555
提升环境的品味,先生
Embellish the scene, sir. 

187
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:30,043
提升环境的品味,科学家,工业巨头...
Embellish the scene. Scientists. Captains of industry...

188
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:32,965
你都带了谁?拖把头和水桶腰
What do you bring me? Mrs Mop and Mrs Bucket.

189
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:35,013
特勒姆说灌点杜松子酒
Caterham says they're both first class 

190
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:36,509
两位就都是上流社会的人了
if you get a bit of gin down them.

191
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,564
哦,是嘛?   有问题吗?
Oh, does he?   Problem?

192
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:40,224
完全没有,先生
Not at all, sir.

193
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,628
您的客人很...多元化
Very diverse guest list.

194
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:46,001
很好,那我要去跟她们聊聊了
Good. Well, I should join in.

195
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,944
你特意安排的吗?
Was this your doing?

196
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:55,254
乔治要接受我们真实的样子
George will have to take us as he finds us.

197
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:59,788
怎么了?   嫁给我吧
What?   Marry me.

198
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,537
比尔
Bill.

199
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:06,679
女人空腹的时候可别求婚
Never propose on an empty stomach.

200
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,691
晚饭之后再问我吧
Ask me again after supper.

201
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:10,732
你没事情要做吗?
Don't you have to be somewhere?

202
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,656
挺热的是不是?
Sultry, isn't it?

203
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:29,195
你做头发了吗?
What have you done to your hair?

204
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:31,151
没有
Not a thing.

205
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,628
你能注意到真好啊,亲爱的
Sweet of you to notice, darling.

206
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:37,679
你没忘记你答应会在周日晚上前回复我吧?
You haven't forgotten that you promised me an answer by Sunday night?

207
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:39,773
就快要到了
The clock is ticking.

208
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:52,262
请原谅,但是你们看起来太美了
Forgive me, but you all looked so perfect.

209
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:55,146
像是画里出来的人
Like you had stepped out of a photograph.

210
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:58,448
路德维格伯爵,请允许我介绍,克莱门特瑞佛
Count Ludwig, allow me to introduce Clement Revel,

211
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:00,440
凯特勒姆家族的第九代
Ninth Marquis of Caterham.

212
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:03,670
您好   很高兴认识您
How do you do?   The honour is entirely mine.

213
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,451
晚上好,夫人们
Good evening, madam.

214
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,118
这两位就是您女儿吗?
And these are your two little Revels?

215
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:13,127
能赏脸吗?
Would you indulge a fading guest?

216
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:15,044
赏个光嘛
Why not?

217
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,784
我真的不会跳舞.您邀请她跳吧
I've two left feet. So why don't you try her?

218
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:20,538
反正大家都喜欢她
Because everyone else seems to.

219
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:32,856
节奏感多好啊
Oh, for a sense of rhythm.

220
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,534
舞姿真优雅
Such a graceful dancer.

221
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:37,594
他们都跳的不错不是吗?
Well, they all are, aren't they?

222
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:41,714
不过这可算不上是什么有实用的修养
Still, hardly the most practical accomplishment.

223
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:43,892
您第一次来英国吗?
Is this your first visit to our shores?

224
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:47,276
不,我都来过好几次了
No, I am an inveterate itinerant, I'm afraid.

225
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:50,706
至少年轻的时候常来
Or I was, once upon a time.

226
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:53,205
您在笑话我呢
Now you are laughing at me.

227
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:55,211
没有,没有,只是您的英语
No, no, no, it's just your English.

228
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:56,300
说得真好
Splendid.

229
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,586
我的老师很严格的
I had a highly disciplined teacher, you see.

230
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:01,341
她只教我说绕口令
She taught me only tongue-twisters.

231
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:04,786
吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮
Inveterate itinerant.

232
00:14:04,786 --> 00:14:06,697
吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮
Inveterate itinerant.

233
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:08,816
吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮
Inveterate itinerant!

234
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,462
晚饭要凉了
Your dinner is getting cold.

235
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,268
很好,非常好
Very good. Excellent.

236
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:27,130
班铎,你带大家进去啊?   好啊
Bundle, will you lead on?   Yes, of course.

237
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,619
贝金索普小姐,您先请
Miss Blenkinsopp, after you.

238
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,082
请跟我来,小姐们
Follow me, ladies.

239
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:43,472
您能来真好
Very good, you're with us.

240
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:48,798
您来吗?   哦
Shall we?   Oh.

241
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:10,873
晚餐很不错,谢谢
A splendid dinner, thank you.

242
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:12,104
是的,很丰盛
Yes, very filling.

243
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:13,511
请允许我问一下
Forgive my asking, sir. 

244
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:16,617
您想来我家是因为这建筑吗?
Your interest in my house, is it for architecture?

245
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:20,663
不,不,我对建筑并不懂
No, no. I have no head for grand design, for architecture.

246
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,887
你家的画...   好的大都卖掉了
Your paintings...   We sold most of the decent ones.

247
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:26,696
我们还留着这副凡代克的画
We still have our Van Dyck.

248
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:27,824
是啊
So I see.

249
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:31,736
这位是什么人啊?   一位什么公爵的
Who is this fellow?   Some old duke.

250
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:34,661
里士满的呢
Richmond. Duke of.

251
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:37,027
里士满,是啊
Richmond. Yes.

252
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:42,081
要是既不为了艺术品,也不为了建筑,那是...?
So if it's not the art, or the architecture, then...?

253
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:44,067
历史啊
Oh, the history.

254
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:47,364
据说这房子接待过不少伟大的人
The great men rumoured to have met within these walls.

255
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,671
签订条约,探讨政务
Treaties, affairs of state,

256
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:54,282
甚至战争也在这里的咖啡和雪茄间开始和结束
wars, even, begun and ended here over coffee and cigars.

257
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:57,300
哪有这么玄乎呀
Oh, nothing so biblical, I assure you.

258
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:00,086
凯特勒姆这是在谦虚呢
He's being modest, aren't you, Caterham?

259
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:02,868
烟囱大厦名声在外
Chimneys had quite a reputation.

260
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:05,361
那现在怎么沦落了?
So what happened?

261
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:06,414
你说什么?
What was that?

262
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:08,845
出了点事
We ran into some bother.

263
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:12,653
你是说1932年的那次宴会?
Oh, the party of 1932?

264
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:14,521
哦,老黄历了
Oh, that old yarn.

265
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:18,673
我们刚从加拉加斯(委内瑞拉首都)回国来
Well, we'd come back from an embassy posting. Caracas.

266
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:20,664
结果那也是我最后一次做驻外大使了
It was my last one, as it turned out.

267
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:22,280
那年弗吉尼亚还没出生呢
It was before Virginia was born.

268
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:24,387
不管怎样,那晚真是不错
Anyway, it was quite a night.

269
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,211
你妈妈很会举办宴会的,花园里还有请来的乐队在演奏
Your mother always gave wonderful parties, 

270
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:28,733
你妈妈很会举办宴会的,花园里还有请来的乐队在演奏
with a band out in the garden.

271
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:30,343
我听说过
I remember the story, yes.

272
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:32,459
你当时还在场呢,是不是乔治?
You were there yourself, weren't you, George?

273
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:37,035
去帮把手.我陪着索梅塞夫人去的
Helping out. I was accompanying Lady Somerset.

274
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:40,227
我很受...启发
It was um...most instructive.

275
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:43,246
这张照片就是那时拍的吗?
Is this it here?

276
00:16:43,246 --> 00:16:46,430
是的.   这是在哪?
Yes.   Where is that?

277
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,266
玫瑰园   啊
The rose garden.   Ah.

278
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:50,456
我们动人的维也纳华尔兹
Our lovely Viennese waltz.

279
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,372
您的歌声真好听   谢谢
Charming singing voice.   Thank you.

280
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,189
不过,那晚还出了点事
Anyway, there was a bit of a to-do

281
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:58,066
索梅塞公爵夫人当晚借来了一个很大的胸针戴着...
because the Duchess of Somerset

282
00:16:58,066 --> 00:17:01,613
索梅塞公爵夫人当晚借来了一个很大的胸针戴着...
had borrowed a large brooch for the evening. On her...

283
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:02,704
大胸针?
Large brooch?

284
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:05,720
爸爸,那是印度迈索尔的钻石
Daddy, it was the Mysore Diamond from India,

285
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,248
大概是世界上最有名的钻石了
possibly the most revered diamond in the world.

286
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:13,571
嗯,不管是啥,早餐的时候发现它不见了
Well, whatever it was, by breakfast time it had disappeared.

287
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:19,323
被偷了,被个一无是处的客厅女仆,叫艾格尼丝的偷走了
Stolen. By some good-for-nothing parlour maid named Agnes.

288
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:22,762
客厅女仆,像小说里的故事呢!
A parlour maid. What an English saga!

289
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:25,964
那个女仆当晚就失踪了,不是吗?
The maid vanished overnight. Isn't that right?

290
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:29,030
钻石也再没找到
And the diamond was never ever to be found again.

291
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,614
还要咖啡吗?   哦,是的,谢谢
Anyone for more coffee?   Oh, yes, please.

292
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:36,833
这个艾格尼丝是个什么样的女孩子?
So what sort of girl was she, this Agnes?

293
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:39,353
也许没人注意过她?
Or did nobody notice?

294
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:43,309
只有19岁,我想肯定是一时冲昏了头脑
Well, only 19 years old. She must have lost her head, I suppose.

295
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:48,850
不管怎样,这件事让我的外交生涯结束了
Anyway, it meant the end of my career in the diplomatic service.

296
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:52,780
说起来真是丢人
All rather shameful.

297
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:58,336
女士们能不能让我们单独...
Well, if the ladies can spare us...?

298
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:01,148
谈生意   是,当然
To business.   Indeed. Yes.

299
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,154
我给你们生意
I give you business.

300
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:07,347
你要我们的铁矿啊,洛马克斯议员?
You want our iron, Mr Lomax, MP?

301
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:12,090
那是当然的   我只提出一个要求
Well, naturally.   I make one request.

302
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:14,186
烟囱大厦
Chimneys.

303
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:19,021
把烟囱大厦作为给我个人的礼物
Give me Chimneys as a personal favour. And, in return, I guarantee

304
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:21,105
作为回报,我会保证,你们能要多少拿多少
Give me Chimneys as a personal favour. And, in return, I guarantee

305
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:25,215
作为回报,我会保证,你们能要多少拿多少
you can take home all the riches your heart desires.

306
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:28,390
这我不知道...   我们不卖房子
Well, I'm not sure...   We are not for sale.

307
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,123
不卖,你说啊
Not for sale. Tell them.

308
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:35,573
你们去打打桥牌怎么样?
Why don't you all try a hand of bridge?

309
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,293
哦,真见鬼   好的
Oh, for God's sake.   Yes.

310
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:55,352
你确定了吗?    是的
You're quite sure?    Absolutely.

311
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:59,090
那好,在这里...签字
Very well. Then mark your cross... ..here.

312
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:08,043
伯爵,现在请在这里签字
Now, Count, if you'd be kind enough to sign here.

313
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:09,151
好的
With great pleasure.

314
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,662
洛马克斯先生!先生!
Mr Lomax! Sir!

315
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,657
简!   发生什么事了?   我不知道
Jane!   What's happening?   I don't know.

316
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,407
几点了?
What time is it?

317
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:35,165
请你们到楼下去
If you'd all like to gather downstairs...

318
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:40,739
对不起,把你们都吵醒了
I'm sorry to have to wake you all up

319
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:45,240
但是洛马克斯先生的一位警卫被打昏了
but one of Mr Lomax's security staff was found unconscious.

320
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,125
是不是?
Is that so?

321
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,741
是的,先生.是罗伯茨
That's right, sir. Roberts.

322
00:19:47,741 --> 00:19:50,763
埃弗斯利,我们都在这里了吗?   是的
All present and correct, Eversleigh?   Indeed so.

323
00:19:50,763 --> 00:19:52,614
我想还少一位呢
I believe we're one short.

324
00:19:52,614 --> 00:19:54,556
伯爵   除了伯爵
The Count.   Out for the count.

325
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:57,406
我倒不奇怪,想想他喝成什么样了
That's no surprise, considering how he was knocking it back.

326
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,000
看看能不能叫醒他
See if you can raise him.

327
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,419
他不在屋里,先生
He's not in his room, sir.

328
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:02,287
什么?   他在哪?
What?   Where is he?

329
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,566
我想我们应该搜一搜
Perhaps we need a search party.

330
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:07,907
没错,杰夫斯,你和罗伯茨把后门封锁上
Indeed. Jaffers you and Roberts seal off the back door.

331
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,536
班铎,你去看看以前仆人的住处
Bundle, the old servants' quarters.

332
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:12,498
埃弗斯利,你和贝金索普小姐在一楼找
Eversleigh You and Miss Blenkinsopp, the ground floor,

333
00:20:12,498 --> 00:20:14,034
我和弗吉尼亚在楼上找
and Virginia and I will look upstairs.

334
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:15,346
弗吉尼亚怎么不能和我一起找?
Why Can't Virginia come with me?

335
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:16,656
没时间了
We don't have time for this.

336
00:20:16,656 --> 00:20:18,701
你干嘛总想坏我的事?
Why do you always undermine me?

337
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,768
你们俩消停一会行不?
Will you two kindly desist?

338
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:22,446
谢谢了
Thank you.

339
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:26,762
弗吉尼亚,你能不能上楼把他的药拿下来?
Now, Virginia, can you run upstairs and collect his medicine?

340
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:29,823
简在这里看着他   好的
Jane will remain here and keep an eye on him.   Of course.

341
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,227
其他人我们分头找.好吗?
The rest of us can just as well look by ourselves. Agreed?

342
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:40,879
路德维格伯爵
Count Ludwig.

343
00:20:41,124 --> 00:20:42,504
路德维格伯爵
Count Ludwig.

344
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:47,749
这样不好吧
I wouldn't think that's wise.

345
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:49,295
大概不好
Probably not.

346
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,303
你来点?
What about you?

347
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,221
好啊
Why not.

348
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,375
我们都多久没说过话了啊,你和我?
Seems ages since we talked, you and I?

349
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:08,292
玛德琳这些年来也没怎么跟你联络了
Had been Madeleine rather lost touch with you over the years.

350
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:10,577
不在一起难免会渐渐疏远吧
One grows apart, I think.

351
00:21:10,577 --> 00:21:11,898
大概是的
I suppose.

352
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:16,147
不过,我真的很感激你一直为我留心弗吉尼亚的事
Still, I'm so grateful that you keep an eye on Virginia for me.

353
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:18,825
当爸爸的也有做不到的事啊
A father can only do so much.

354
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:24,288
这几年来,自从玛德琳...
And these past years, since Madeleine...

355
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:28,462
反正过的不容易啊
Well, it's not been easy.

356
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:31,344
我听说你想搬去伦敦住
I gather you're hoping to move to London.

357
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:34,266
班铎可不允许
Not if Bundle can help it.

358
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:40,986
哦,可怜的孩子,这里是她唯一的家
Oh, poor child, it's the only home she's ever known, you see

359
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:45,789
但实际上记忆根本不是什么安慰
The truth is memories are no consolation.

360
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:49,031
那些好的也不是
Not even the good ones.

361
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:50,790
我把你的药拿来了
I've brought your medicine.

362
00:21:51,836 --> 00:21:55,195
谢天谢地我还有一双女儿啊
Thank God for my darling girls.

363
00:21:55,195 --> 00:21:56,543
爸爸
Daddy.

364
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:03,510
乔治?   等会的!
George?   Not now!

365
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,593
那声音好像是...   是开枪吗?
That sounded almost like...   Was that a gunshot?

366
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,188
关上那扇门!
Someone close that door!

367
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:17,970
你们找到他了吗?
Well, where is he? Any sign?

368
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,750
你听到了吗?   大概半个郡都听到了
Did you hear it?   I think half the county heard it.

369
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,994
他不会凭空消失啊
He can't have just vanished. 

370
00:22:21,994 --> 00:22:24,596
没有什么小门,小屋子什么的?
Are there no doorways, no outbuildings?

371
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:28,043
你想不会是...   我们的秘门
You don't think...?   Our little door.

372
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:40,424
啊!   拿着
Ah!   Take that.

373
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:43,917
墙上应该有电筒,在这呢
Should be torches on the wall. Here is it. 

374
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:45,188
自己拿一个   走啊,简
Help yourself.   Come on, Jane.

375
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:02,423
这是血吗?   看起来像
What is that? Blood?   Looks like it.

376
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,432
安东尼?
Anthony?

377
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:16,709
我想他是中枪了   什么?
I think he's been shot.   What?

378
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:21,121
奇...奇...奇...
Want! Want! Want!

379
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,479
路德维格伯爵?能听到我说话吗?
Count Ludwig? Can you hear me?

380
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,906
他还有气吗?   摸摸他的脉搏
Is he breathing?   Check his pulse.

381
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,158
你能听到我吗?
Can you hear me?

382
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:29,525
哦,天啊
Oh, God.

383
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:31,737
不是我干的   我摸不到脉搏
It wasn't me.   I can't find a pulse.

384
00:23:33,277 --> 00:23:34,505
我想他是死了
I think he's dead.

385
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:36,303
不是我干的!
It wasn't me!

386
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:53,175
弗吉尼亚! 弗吉尼亚! 弗吉尼亚! 弗吉尼亚!
Virginia! Virginia! Virginia! Virginia!

387
00:23:53,285 --> 00:23:55,213
他是个多可爱的人啊
He was such an enchanting man.

388
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:58,137
还是我们的客人
And he was our guest.

389
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:02,833
我相信事情不是我们想的那样的
I'm sure there's a perfectly innocent explanation.

390
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:06,859
弗吉尼亚!
Virginia!

391
00:24:07,397 --> 00:24:09,627
我得去找他   你敢!
I should go to him.   Don't you dare.

392
00:24:09,677 --> 00:24:11,880
别,回来!
Don't, come back.

393
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:14,997
弗吉尼亚!   安东尼
Virginia!   Anthony.

394
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,519
我的爱人   安东尼!
My love.   Anthony!

395
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,717
你不能进去,小姐   我能跟他说话吗?
You can't go in, miss.   May I at least speak to him?

396
00:24:19,717 --> 00:24:23,029
恐怕不行啊   哦求你了,求你了
I'm sorry, miss.   Oh, please. Please.

397
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:29,218
安东尼你为什么会出现在这里?
Anthony, what are you even doing here?

398
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:33,423
弗吉尼亚...你得答应我一件事
Virginia... You must promise me something.

399
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,097
什么事都行
Anything.

400
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:38,092
求你...答应我你会忘记我
Please...promise me you'll forget me.

401
00:24:40,157 --> 00:24:43,597
安东尼?你吓着我了
Anthony? You're scaring me.

402
00:24:44,305 --> 00:24:45,950
安东尼
Anthony.

403
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:54,327
芬驰
Finch.

404
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,266
见到你太好了
Thank God. Good to see you again.

405
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:02,105
芬驰探长,苏格兰场的领袖
Inspector Finch. The guru of Scotland Yard.

406
00:25:02,105 --> 00:25:06,211
芬驰?他长得像只猫,你不觉得吗?
Finch? He looks quite like a cat, don't you think?

407
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:10,245
我讨厌猫   嘘!
I loathe cats.   Ssh!

408
00:25:14,635 --> 00:25:18,417
我猜他在内政部一定有不少粉丝吧
I gather he has devotees all over the Home Office.

409
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,739
大家都觉得他很神秘呢
They regard him as some sort of mystic.

410
00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:24,317
有点像诺里奇的朱利安,不过是拥有逮捕权的
A bit like Julian of Norwich, only with powers of arrest.

411
00:25:24,317 --> 00:25:25,923
我们对受害人都有什么了解?
What do we know of the victim?

412
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,351
1892年生于维也纳
Born Vienna, 1892.

413
00:25:28,351 --> 00:25:31,421
父母有钱,年轻的时候常到处周游
Wealthy parents. Travelled about a good deal in his youth.

414
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:33,362
就是喜欢到处玩的那种人
Something of a wandering spirit.

415
00:25:33,362 --> 00:25:35,289
战后很快进入了政界
Entered politics soon after the war.

416
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:38,132
我让我的人在镇上找个地方给你住
I can get my chap to find you a place in the town.

417
00:25:38,132 --> 00:25:39,592
没必要,我就住在烟囱大厦
No need. I shall be staying at Chimneys. 

418
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:41,255
谋杀犯可不打点上班
Murder rarely keeps office hours.

419
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:41,933
你好
Hello.

420
00:25:44,297 --> 00:25:45,397
呼吸一下新鲜空气
Bit of fresh air.

421
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:51,099
如果处理的不好,会成为政治上的灾难
Politically this could be a disaster, if not handled with care.

422
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:52,015
是啊
Indeed.

423
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:55,337
就是说女士们都早早休息了?
So the ladies retired early?

424
00:25:55,337 --> 00:25:56,989
我们要谈生意
We had some business.

425
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,732
与此无关   他要买下烟囱大厦
Er...not relevant.   He wanted to buy Chimneys.

426
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:03,312
他要买下烟囱大厦?
He wanted to buy Chimneys?

427
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:07,493
他的建议是由政府买下这栋房子,再以礼物的形式赠予伯爵
Well, the proposal was that the government would purchase the house,

428
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:10,832
他的建议是由政府买下这栋房子,再以礼物的形式赠予伯爵
and then pass it on to Count Ludwig as a gift.

429
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:12,995
算是贿赂吗?   别瞎说...
A bribe?   Don't be absurd...

430
00:26:12,995 --> 00:26:14,257
是给他个人的贿赂
A personal bribe.

431
00:26:14,604 --> 00:26:19,027
作为回报,他会把他们的重工业分一杯羹给我们
In return for which, he hands over a share of their heavy industry.

432
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:22,851
我们对此事的道德立场是什么?
Where do we stand on that, morally?

433
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:24,265
我想反正是不会拒绝的
Well back, I'd have thought.

434
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:28,435
有买卖的文件吗?
Is there paperwork for this sale?

435
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:32,983
签好字,封好印,锁在我屋抽屉里呢
Signed, sealed and in my room on the top drawer.

436
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:35,459
现在已经没用了
All academic now, of course.

437
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:36,940
了解
Understood.

438
00:26:37,675 --> 00:26:41,145
凯特勒姆勋爵,一扇门关上了,另一扇打开了
As one door closes, another stands ajar, Lord Caterham.

439
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,060
确实
Indeed.

440
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:47,865
各位先生们是什么时候休息的?
So you gentlemen retired at...

441
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:50,062
差一刻十一点的时候
About a quarter to eleven.

442
00:26:50,062 --> 00:26:51,755
直到我们被铃声惊醒
Until we were woken by the fire bell.

443
00:26:51,755 --> 00:26:53,508
洛马克斯先生!先生!
Mr Lomax! Sir!

444
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:57,141
什么时候?   差二十分到午夜
At what time?   Twenty to midnight.

445
00:26:57,141 --> 00:26:58,991
我们都到了楼下
We all met downstairs.

446
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:02,299
没见到伯爵,所以我们就去找他
No sign of the Count. So off we went, looking for him.

447
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:05,323
除了克莱门特和我
All save Clement and myself.

448
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,889
然后就砰地一声
Next thing... Boom!

449
00:27:08,122 --> 00:27:09,276
枪声吗?
The gunshot?

450
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,058
他一直都在通道里,就几码之外
He was in the passageway all along. Just a few yards away.

451
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:15,647
武器上有指纹吗?
Any fingerprints on the weapon?

452
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:18,169
没有
Regrettably not.

453
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,946
但是我们抓到了犯人,安东尼凯德
Still, we have the culprit. Anthony Cade.

454
00:27:21,946 --> 00:27:24,851
当然了,要问他几句话
He has one or two questions to answer, certainly.

455
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,963
我能看看尸体吗?   我带你去   谢谢
May I see the body?   I shall take you there at once.   Thank you.

456
00:27:27,963 --> 00:27:29,519
哦,还是让...
Or perhaps Miss...

457
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:33,749
马普尔   马普尔小姐,方便吗?
Marple.   Marple. Yes. If it's no inconvenience?

458
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:37,492
哦,行啊,没问题
Oh. Well, no, not at all.

459
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:52,101
都过了就寝时间近一个小时了,他在这里干嘛?
What was he doing here, almost an hour after he went to bed?

460
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:59,161
晚餐时他说对凡代克的画很感兴趣
He showed an interest over dinner in the Van Dyck portrait.

461
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:03,392
或许是回来...   自己欣赏一会?
I suppose the Count could have returned...    A private viewing? 

462
00:28:03,422 --> 00:28:04,801
可能是吧
I suppose.

463
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:07,252
碰巧秘门开了
And chanced upon the secret door.

464
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:13,114
不过这世上没什么巧合不是吗?
Except that nothing quite happens by chance, does it? Not really.

465
00:28:14,655 --> 00:28:16,982
或者这只是我的偏见?
Or is that my tidy-minded preference?

466
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,205
我注意到你身边没有人
I see you don't have a man with you.

467
00:28:31,937 --> 00:28:32,953
什么?
I'm sorry?

468
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:37,898
嗯,一般探长都会带个人
Well, inspectors nowadays tend to have a man with them.

469
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:42,051
啊   或许你喜欢自己独行?
Ah.   Perhaps you prefer to muse alone?

470
00:28:42,051 --> 00:28:46,691
或许没人愿意跟我做搭档   哦
Perhaps no man would have me.   Oh.

471
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:51,649
这些血...   他就在这里被射伤
This blood...   He was shot here.

472
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:57,579
也可能是从这边一路爬或者走或者被拖过来的
And crawled, staggered, or was dragged this-a-way...

473
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:03,206
在这里被发现时倒在凯德先生的怀里
..where he was found in the arms of Mr Cade. Here.

474
00:29:03,206 --> 00:29:06,157
然后在这里倒向可怜的弗吉尼亚
Before falling on poor Virginia. Here.

475
00:29:07,782 --> 00:29:10,989
显然是这样的
All fairly straightforward, apparently.

476
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:19,252
啊哈
Ah-ha.

477
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:27,672
是封信吗?
Is it a letter?

478
00:29:29,277 --> 00:29:31,301
不是
Not quite.

479
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:37,562
高音谱号   还是位艺术鉴赏家呢
A treble clef.    A virtuoso.

480
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:40,763
您能拿着这个帮我研究研究吗,马普尔小姐
Perhaps you could take this and study it for me, Miss Marple.

481
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,313
好的
Very well.

482
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,117
伯爵死前说了些什么
The Count said something before he died.

483
00:29:53,117 --> 00:29:57,367
奇,奇...   奇?你确定吗?
Want, want...   Want? Are you sure?

484
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:59,578
嗯   什么意思呢?
Mm-hm.    Meaning?

485
00:29:59,858 --> 00:30:03,683
或许是想说什么话,临死之言
Well, I suppose we all want something, even at death's door.

486
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:05,591
遗言之类的
Kiss of life, perhaps?

487
00:30:06,475 --> 00:30:09,621
你怎么到这里的?   我从那边翻墙进来
How did you get here?   I climbed over the wall.

488
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:11,063
我要进房子里
I was eager to get up to the house

489
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:13,406
这位先生挡住了我的路
and this gentleman was blocking the path.

490
00:30:13,406 --> 00:30:14,741
能站一下位置吗,先生?
Would you mind, sir?

491
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:22,257
我记得
Well, as I remember,

492
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:26,584
我从这边过来
I came from around here.

493
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:32,743
我看到了他,我慌神了
Then I spotted the gentleman, I panicked,

494
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:34,869
然后...   你袭击了他
and then...   You hit him.

495
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,386
是的,真抱歉
Yes, I am sorry about that.

496
00:30:40,386 --> 00:30:41,917
用这个吗?
Using this?

497
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:43,769
是的
Exactly.

498
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:49,947
是什么时间?   11点33分整
What time was that?   11:33. Precisely.

499
00:30:50,607 --> 00:30:52,191
我记得这么清楚是因为我看表了
I remember because I looked at my wrist watch.

500
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:54,685
你眼力真好啊,凯德先生
I envy your eyesight, Mr Cade.

501
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:56,192
是这样的
You see, that's the thing.

502
00:30:56,972 --> 00:31:00,742
我看到表是因为楼上有间房间的灯亮了
I know, because there was a light on in one of the upstairs rooms.

503
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,291
二楼,右数第二间
It was first storey and then second to the right.

504
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:10,458
我记得有人生火了
Now, I can remember because someone had lit a fire.

505
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,335
这么暖和的天还生火吗
Rather a warm night for a fire.

506
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:16,147
上面的烟囱里有烟冒出来
Well, there was definitely smoke coming out of the chimney above.

507
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:20,998
反正,这个时候我已经很慌乱了
Anyway, at this stage common sense sounded the retreat.

508
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:21,830
你听到铃声了吗?
Did you heed the warning?

509
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,281
没有,就像我说的,我慌神了
Well, sadly, common sense and I are no longer on speaking terms

510
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:27,845
我继续走,进了门
so I carried on along here and through the door.

511
00:31:31,945 --> 00:31:33,481
然后到这里
And then I came down here,

512
00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:37,457
打开活板门
opened the trap door

513
00:31:39,454 --> 00:31:41,226
然后我听到了枪声
and then I heard the gunshot.

514
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:46,878
啊...   我的天!
Ahh...   Good God!

515
00:31:46,878 --> 00:31:49,036
他已经中枪了?   是的
He'd been shot already?   Yes.

516
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:52,673
你知道是谁射伤他的吗?   不知道
Any idea who shot him?   Afraid not.

517
00:31:52,673 --> 00:31:56,297
但是左轮手枪只离你三英尺远,受害人就倒在你脚下
And yet, the revolver three feet from you, the victim at your heels?

518
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:58,337
我根本没看见左轮
I swear I never saw any revolver.

519
00:31:58,337 --> 00:32:02,317
凯德先生,能问问你到底来这干嘛的吗?
Mr Cade, may one ask what you were actually doing here?

520
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,156
我倒是在想你什么时候会问起这个呢
Yes, well, I did wonder when you'd get around to asking that.

521
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:08,284
事实上
The truth is, 

522
00:32:08,284 --> 00:32:10,992
我不想不争取一下就让给洛马克斯
I couldn't let Lomax have his way without putting up a fight.

523
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:13,488
你指的是弗吉尼亚吗?   是的
His way with Virginia?   Yes.

524
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:15,588
我想好了静静等着
I thought to myself: just sit tight

525
00:32:15,588 --> 00:32:17,758
早餐的时候突然出现吓你们一跳
and then burst in at breakfast and give you all a fright.

526
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:19,326
你确实吓着我们了
You certainly did that.

527
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:21,412
警官在你的口袋里找到了这个
The constable found this in your pocket.

528
00:32:22,716 --> 00:32:25,579
是谁写的?
Oh. Any idea who wrote it?

529
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:30,574
"亲爱的凯德,来烟囱大厦,花园里有个活板门"
"Dear Cade, come to Chimneys. There's a trapdoor in the garden.

530
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,876
"11点45分整"
11:45 sharp."

531
00:32:33,268 --> 00:32:35,484
什么?这不是我写的
What? I didn't write this.

532
00:32:36,332 --> 00:32:39,618
你确定吗?凯德先生好像觉得是...   这不是我的风格
Are you sure? Mr Cade seems to think...   Not my style.

533
00:32:39,618 --> 00:32:42,230
我不会这么匆忙的写一封情书
A love note is not something you just dash off.

534
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:45,297
你笑什么
I don't see what you're sniggering at.

535
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,420
对不起,我二了,我能看看吗?
I'm sorry - idiot - may I see?

536
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:52,819
拿过来
Hand it over.

537
00:32:54,802 --> 00:32:58,079
从邮戳来看是本地寄出的
It appears from the postmark to have been sent locally,

538
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,300
快递,昨天早上寄出的
express service, as late as yesterday morning.

539
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,566
这信不是你们寄出去的吗?
So, none of you sent this letter?

540
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,261
这个假设怎么样?
How's this for a hypothesis?

541
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:11,868
凯德自己打好信
Cade types the letter himself,

542
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:14,498
坐车去村里寄了出去
takes the train down to the village and posts it.

543
00:33:14,498 --> 00:33:17,774
就是为了来引诱弗吉尼亚的
All in a cynical bid to ensnare Virginia.

544
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:20,911
乱说!我昨天早上还和他喝茶来着
Rubbish! I was having tea with him yesterday morning.

545
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:23,320
在艾治威大道的街角里昂
At the Lyons Corner House on the Edgware Road.

546
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,027
而且我们很愉快
And it was very nice.

547
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:31,465
洛马克斯先生,你的房间是倒数第二间是吗?
And, Mr Lomax, your room is second from the end, isn't it?

548
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:32,400
是又怎样?
So?

549
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,734
铃响之前,那里有灯光
There was a light on there last night. Just before the alarm sounded.

550
00:33:36,966 --> 00:33:38,981
胡说!谁说的?
Rubbish! Says who?

551
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:42,067
哦,凯德
Oh. Cade.

552
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:44,927
是为了分散你的视线,探长
Blatant attempt to put you off your game, Inspector.

553
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:45,918
安东尼
Anthony.

554
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:05,691
我说过了,我不值得你牺牲
I told you. I'm not worth the sacrifice.

555
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,584
我会自己做判断的,谢谢了
I'll be the judge of that, thank you very much.

556
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,000
请你们一直待在烟囱大厦,等待我们的进一步通知
If you would be so good as to 

557
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,917
请你们一直待在烟囱大厦,等待我们的进一步通知
remain at Chimneys until further notice.

558
00:34:13,286 --> 00:34:15,798
那他呢?你就打算让他在这里闲逛吗?
And what about him? You're not going to let him wander about?

559
00:34:15,798 --> 00:34:18,836
我们会盯着他的,我们会盯着你们所有人
No, we'll keep an eye on him. Keep an eye on all of you.

560
00:34:28,977 --> 00:34:31,128
很不正常,不是吗?
It's quite perverse, isn't it?

561
00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:35,331
他是很有乐感的一个人
He was such a musical fellow.

562
00:34:35,752 --> 00:34:37,366
很好的舞者
Quite the dancer.

563
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,986
我总是说曲调的作用是鼓舞士气,不是吗?
I always say the point of a tune is to boost the morale, surely?

564
00:34:40,986 --> 00:34:42,254
确实
Indeed.

565
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:45,363
有什么要我帮忙的吗?   啊柴德维尔,就找你呢
May I help?   Ah, Treadwell, the very man.

566
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:48,416
弗吉尼亚那本音乐手册在哪?你知道我说的哪本吗?
Where is that musical handbook of Virginia's? You know the one?

567
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:49,608
《闪电的节奏》?
Hits Of The Blitz?

568
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:52,155
就是那本.来吧
The very nelly. Come.

569
00:34:54,983 --> 00:34:58,262
不对...不对...
No...No...

570
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:01,724
哦
Oh.

571
00:35:02,816 --> 00:35:04,344
正研究着呢,马普尔小姐?
Hard at it, Miss Marple?

572
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:07,092
探长,嗯...我有点看不明白了
Inspector, it's... I'm a little lost.

573
00:35:07,635 --> 00:35:12,066
几乎看不出音节在哪开始在哪结束
One can hardly see where one bar ends and the next begins.

574
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:19,872
不好意思
I'm sorry, forgive me.

575
00:35:19,872 --> 00:35:22,230
这...   基本上就不是音乐
It's...   Hardly music at all.

576
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,087
会不会...   我都觉得...
Could it be...   I almost wonder...

577
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:26,848
不好意思   你说
Forgive me.   Go on.

578
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,793
我在想,是不是
Oh, well, I wonder, is it possible,

579
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:35,779
这实际上是一封密信
it is, in fact, a message of some sort in code?

580
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:44,233
你在想什么啊?
What were you thinking of? 

581
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:46,649
你根本不了解这个人,也不了解他的家人
You know nothing about the man or his people.

582
00:35:46,649 --> 00:35:48,957
我知道他很风趣很冲动
I know he's funny and reckless

583
00:35:48,957 --> 00:35:51,397
他妈妈有辆很好的自行车
and his mother has a jolly nice bicycle,

584
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:53,458
而我觉得这比认识些大人物要强的多
which I happen to think counts for more than

585
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:55,445
而我觉得这比认识些大人物要强的多
a dozen columns in Who's Who.

586
00:35:56,124 --> 00:36:00,501
他开了个酒吧   哦,多感人啊   在非洲,布拉瓦约
He ran a bar.   Oh, how philanthropic.   In Africa. In Bulawayo.

587
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:03,227
他有个朋友,生意伙伴
He had a friend with him, they were business partners.

588
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:06,539
他的朋友叫什么?   吉米麦格拉斯
And does this friend have a name?   Jimmy McGrath.

589
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,531
有一段时间还做的挺好的
They did rather well, for a time,

590
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,910
但是吉米有酗酒的毛病
but Jimmy liked to drink, you see.

591
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,368
把钱都赌光了
He gambled it all away.

592
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:16,375
一场里全输给一个比勒陀利亚来的人了
Lost it in one sitting to a gentleman from Pretoria.

593
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,743
你认识他还不得两星期
You've known him for less than a fortnight.

594
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,342
爸爸   啊,凯特勒姆
Daddy.   Ah, Caterham.

595
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:23,255
给你女儿讲讲道理
Knock some sense into your daughter.

596
00:36:23,255 --> 00:36:26,544
哦,能讲清的人得多猛啊
Oh, well it's a brave man who'd dare to.

597
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:28,387
你妈妈会怎么说呢?
What would your mother have said?

598
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:33,778
你少用我妈说事,我妈妈总是做她真心喜欢的事情
My mother, you presume to speak about, always went with her heart.

599
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:34,973
是吗?
Isn't that so?

600
00:36:35,724 --> 00:36:38,253
她也教我这样做
And she raised me to do the same.

601
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:43,058
弗吉尼亚!   安东尼不是凶手
Virginia!   Anthony is no murderer.

602
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,598
时间不多了   啊!
The clock is ticking.    Ah!

603
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:49,008
瘦得像猴,滑得像蛇,小...
Slimy, slithering, little, Uhh...

604
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:52,224
该死的乔治洛马克斯是我最讨厌的人
George bloody Lomax was the last one on earth.

605
00:36:52,224 --> 00:36:53,779
我无意中听到
I'm not meant to know,

606
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:57,573
他的女仆告诉我,他睡觉还戴发网呢,你能想象吗
his maid told me, he sleep with a hairnet, can you imagine.

607
00:36:57,573 --> 00:37:01,751
别告诉这种事,反而让我觉得他有点可爱
Don't tell me that, always makes me like him a little bit.

608
00:37:03,113 --> 00:37:04,789
我喜欢健康的男人
I love valentina man,

609
00:37:05,979 --> 00:37:09,759
再说每个人都有些小秘密,不是吗?
besides, I mean everybody has a little skeleton, don't they?

610
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:12,635
一不小心就会暴露出来
Any moment tend to leap out of the closet.

611
00:37:12,635 --> 00:37:15,659
在大家面前出丑
Dance and gigger of the bloody society pages.

612
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:19,366
怎么了?   没什么,你可以换牌
What?   No, you're allow to swap cards if you like.

613
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:20,832
我为什么要换呢
Why would I want to,

614
00:37:21,462 --> 00:37:23,004
这是什么牌?
well, what is it?

615
00:37:23,305 --> 00:37:24,463
同花顺
Flush

616
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:28,299
你别故意输给我就为了让我开心
Don't make me win just to cheer me up.

617
00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:30,665
对不起,管不住自己
Sorry, can't help myself.

618
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:35,797
有你真好,就像暴风雨里的港湾
Thank God for you sweetie, like a port in the storm.

619
00:37:35,931 --> 00:37:37,708
比那个要多一点吧?
Bit more than that I hope?

620
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:39,525
我是说你讨厌乔治
I mean with George...

621
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:41,263
至于那位凯德先生...
And as for your pound Mr. Cade...

622
00:37:41,263 --> 00:37:42,097
别说话
Don't.

623
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:44,883
对不起,亲爱的,但是总得有人说啊
I'm sorry darling, but it has to be said.

624
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:46,780
死囚区可不是办婚礼的地方
Death row is no place for a wedding.

625
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,991
不好笑
Not funny.

626
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:49,751
但是很显然我们都在房子里的时候他在通道里呢
But he quite obviously was in that tunnel 

627
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:51,236
但是很显然我们都在房子里的时候他在通道里呢
while we were all in the house.

628
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,487
真的是这样吗?
Or were we?

629
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:57,848
我们真的都在房子里吗?
Or were we?

630
00:37:58,975 --> 00:37:59,888
来啊
Come on.

631
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:06,565
她在干嘛呢?
What's she doing?

632
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:08,787
想证明她爱人的清白
Trying to prove her lover innocent.

633
00:38:09,266 --> 00:38:11,053
她打算怎么做到呢?
How does she propose to do that?

634
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:13,139
我不知道
I have no idea.

635
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,206
不管怎么样,凯德先生都是在通道里被发现的
Like it or not, Mr Cade was still there, 

636
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:18,067
身旁还有尚有余温的抢呢
in the tunnel, with the smoking gun.

637
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:20,472
你会逮捕他吗?   我很想
Will you arrest him?   I'm tempted.

638
00:38:20,886 --> 00:38:23,642
他很粗心,还说谎
He's careless, all the lies he tells.

639
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:26,027
信,还有房子亮灯什么的
The letter, that business with the light on in the house...

640
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:28,979
凯德那样的人狡兔三窟
A man like Cade requires plenty of rope.

641
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:31,708
我们都是这样,你也是
Like most of us. Even you.

642
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:33,755
我也是嫌犯吗?
Am I under suspicion?

643
00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:35,518
我知道你的秘密,马普尔小姐
I know your secret, Miss Marple.

644
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:38,194
你喜欢解谜题
You are a puzzle-outer of mysteries.

645
00:38:39,226 --> 00:38:41,461
我确实参与过一些谜题
I muddle through one or two.

646
00:38:41,461 --> 00:38:44,614
都是碰上了
It's a matter of association.

647
00:38:46,172 --> 00:38:48,976
我...我的村子...   圣玛丽米德村
My... my village, you see...   St. Mary Mead

648
00:38:49,433 --> 00:38:53,858
是,是,是个很不错的社区
Yes, yes, it's a most pleasent community.

649
00:38:53,904 --> 00:38:58,828
有意思的是...全部的生活都在我的窗外走过
Funny how... the whole of life seems to pass by my window.

650
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,285
比你想的要丰富多彩
More than you would expect.

651
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:04,375
你又这样了,探长
You're doing it again, inspector.

652
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:05,552
怎么样?
What's that?

653
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:09,134
不说话,让别人说个不停
Standing mute, so that one is forced to run on and on

654
00:39:09,134 --> 00:39:10,849
不想说的都说了
more than ever one would wish.

655
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,133
我是让你待在我的视线以内,马普尔小姐
I'm keeping you where I can see you, Miss Marple.

656
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:15,584
你都让我一半的同行自叹不如了
You may have disgrace half the men in my profession.

657
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:16,861
但是我不会这样的
But you shan't disgrace me.

658
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,452
我也希望不会这样,探长
I hope not, inspector.

659
00:39:20,846 --> 00:39:22,682
我很羡慕你,业余侦探
I envy you, you know, the amateur sleuth.

660
00:39:22,682 --> 00:39:24,289
没什么好失去的
One has nothing to lose, somehow.

661
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,059
不过,有薪水可拿...是很有用的
Still, a salary is er...convenient.

662
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:32,308
确实
Indeed.

663
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,135
要不是亏了我的侄子...   雷蒙德
If it wasn't for the generosity of my nephew...   Raymond.

664
00:39:36,135 --> 00:39:38,037
我看的一些案宗里写的
So I've read in a dozen case files.

665
00:39:38,578 --> 00:39:39,486
是的
Yes.

666
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:43,722
名字可不怎么高贵
Hardly a distinguished name.

667
00:39:43,976 --> 00:39:46,132
你说雷蒙德?   不是
Raymond?   No.

668
00:39:46,132 --> 00:39:47,115
烟囱大厦
Chimneys.

669
00:39:47,397 --> 00:39:51,008
直到你站在这里,才觉得很贴切
Until it stands before one, and then it all makes sense.

670
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,519
有一打呢
Dozens of them.

671
00:39:54,103 --> 00:39:55,488
真壮观
Splendid.

672
00:39:55,488 --> 00:39:58,932
这些塔楼,很骄傲地挺立...
That great tower standing proud, so that...

673
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,165
凯德先生说谋杀发生的那晚是哪扇窗子亮了?
Which was the window Mr Cade 

674
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:05,179
凯德先生说谋杀发生的那晚是哪扇窗子亮了?
said was lit up on the night of the murder?

675
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,352
右数第二间?   议员的房间
Second from the right?    The MP's room.

676
00:40:07,352 --> 00:40:11,822
但是,你走到凯德先生站的地方
And yet, as one approaches the spot where Mr Cade stood,

677
00:40:11,822 --> 00:40:14,330
有一扇窗是看不到的,注意到了吗?
a window is obscured. Do you see?

678
00:40:14,907 --> 00:40:16,673
由于塔楼的原因
On account of the tower.

679
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:20,334
所以看上去是右数第二间,实际上...
So that what appears to be second from the right is, in fact...

680
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,562
是第三间
Third from the right.

681
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:26,509
那么快要枪响的时候是谁起来了呢?
So who was up and about moments before the gunshot?

682
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:33,206
柴德维尔,能谈谈吗?
Miss Treadwell, might I have a word please?

683
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:40,611
11点33分的时候你的卧室灯是亮的
At 33 minutes past 11 your bedroom light was on,

684
00:40:40,611 --> 00:40:42,385
距枪响只有12分钟
12 minutes before the gunshot.

685
00:40:42,385 --> 00:40:44,169
是,就那么一会
Yes. Briefly.

686
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:45,420
能说说是为什么吗?
Can you tell me why?

687
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:49,262
我想跟路德维格伯爵说话
I wished to speak to Count Ludwig,

688
00:40:49,766 --> 00:40:53,477
不过他床上没人,我就回屋了
but noticing his bed was unoccupied, I returned to my room.

689
00:40:53,477 --> 00:40:56,046
你为什么想跟他说话呢?
Any particular reason for wishing to speak to him?

690
00:40:56,723 --> 00:40:58,156
哦,他...
Oh, he'd...

691
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:02,335
他早些时候说过想加条毯子
earlier in the evening he'd asked for an extra blanket.

692
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,989
你生火了吗?
So perhaps you lit a fire?

693
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:08,539
什么?   还是11点33的时候
I beg your pardon?    At the same time. 11:33.

694
00:41:09,963 --> 00:41:12,136
没有,昨晚没生火
No fires last night. I...

695
00:41:12,405 --> 00:41:14,117
要是有人生火了我会知道的
I would have known, you see.

696
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:21,670
你知道,昨天我有种奇怪的感觉你好像认识他
You know, it's funny, but yesterday I really felt that you knew him.

697
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:27,778
看起来是个大场面啊
This looks a very grand affair.

698
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:29,513
他们那个时候是很气派的
That's how they did it in those days.

699
00:41:29,513 --> 00:41:32,296
这后面的是乐队吗?
And this would be the orchestra, at the back here?

700
00:41:34,218 --> 00:41:35,928
他们那天演奏的是什么?
What sort of music did they play?

701
00:41:36,606 --> 00:41:37,959
华尔兹,大部分是
Waltzes, mainly.

702
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:39,838
维也纳华尔兹吗?
Viennese waltzes?

703
00:41:42,372 --> 00:41:45,736
这是他,是不是?那里,路德维格伯爵
It's him, isn't it? There. Count Ludwig.

704
00:41:45,821 --> 00:41:48,151
这么说他以前来过
So he has been here before.

705
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,270
还是在乐队里呢
And where else but in the orchestra?

706
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,148
这么多年后为什么又回来呢?
What brought you back after all these years?

707
00:42:01,571 --> 00:42:03,263
柴德维尔小姐,你知道吗?
Any thoughts, Miss Treadwell?

708
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:09,163
他是自作孽不可活   你说什么?
He got no more than he deserved.   I'm sorry?

709
00:42:13,332 --> 00:42:15,993
那个女孩...    失踪的女孩?
The girl who...   Who disappeared?

710
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:18,643
艾格尼丝   客厅女仆,是的
Agnes.   The parlour maid, yes.

711
00:42:18,643 --> 00:42:20,936
艾格尼丝出什么事了?
Whatever happened to Agnes?

712
00:42:21,885 --> 00:42:24,575
晚宴那晚,我...
That night after the party, I...

713
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,266
我看到光...
I saw a light...

714
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:26,312
我就是看到这座坟墓开了
This was the tomb I saw opened.

715
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,115
她的尸体,就倒在这里
Her body, it was down there.

716
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:41,495
我来帮你
Let me help you.

717
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:42,940
克莱门特,你没问题吗?
Clement, are you sure?

718
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:15,393
艾格尼丝
Agnes.

719
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,631
她的围裙
Her apron.

720
00:44:20,268 --> 00:44:21,691
可怜的孩子
Poor child.

721
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:27,237
这么长时间,我们一直说她是个贼呢
All this time, we said she was the thief.

722
00:44:37,826 --> 00:44:40,210
我想你应该告诉我们到底出了什么事
I think it's time you told us what happened.

723
00:44:41,351 --> 00:44:44,177
女主人,她有一次跟我说
The mistress, she confided in me once.

724
00:44:44,177 --> 00:44:46,281
玛德琳?   她说什么了?
Madeleine?    What did she tell you?

725
00:44:47,623 --> 00:44:50,724
她说艾格尼丝那晚跟他在一起
She said Agnes was with him that night.

726
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:51,878
跟谁?
With whom?

727
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:54,733
一个音乐家,一个拉小提琴的
A musician. A fiddle player.

728
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,719
哦,伯爵吗?
Oh, the Count?

729
00:44:56,778 --> 00:45:00,918
这么多年,你什么都不说
All these years. Not a word.

730
00:45:01,467 --> 00:45:04,004
我想说的,先生.但是...
I wanted to, sir. But...

731
00:45:04,528 --> 00:45:07,903
我觉得我要是说了,您会联络警察
I thought if I spoke out, you would contact the police,

732
00:45:07,903 --> 00:45:09,436
就会变成一桩丑闻
and there would be more of a scandal.

733
00:45:09,968 --> 00:45:12,467
这件事已经结束了您的职业生涯
It had already ruined your career and 

734
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:15,676
如果宝石被偷都让您蒙羞,那...
if a stolen jewel could cast such a shadow, and then

735
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:18,379
那一条人命...
and then the theft of a life...

736
00:45:18,775 --> 00:45:20,328
对不起
I'm so sorry.

737
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:24,231
我做了什么啊?真抱歉
Oh, what have I done? I'm so sorry.

738
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:29,486
怎么样?    她有所隐瞒
Well?   She's certainly hiding something.

739
00:45:51,726 --> 00:45:53,223
该死
Damn.

740
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:00,529
哦
Oh.

741
00:46:02,321 --> 00:46:04,037
我想找点...   什么?
Wondered if there was any...   What?

742
00:46:04,037 --> 00:46:05,186
纸板
Cardboard.

743
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:08,703
我想找点...不好意思,你在干嘛?
Wondered if there was any... Sorry, what are you...?

744
00:46:08,703 --> 00:46:11,189
你要纸板干嘛?   我在做点东西呢
What do you want cardboard for?   I'm making something.

745
00:46:11,754 --> 00:46:13,975
我不知道哪有纸板,所以帮不了你
Yes, well, I can't see any, so if you wouldn't mind.

746
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:16,990
你打的什么主意,贝金索普小姐?
What are you up to, Miss Blenkinsopp?

747
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:22,599
只想在这该死的大房子里找点清净
Just looking for some privacy in this big, old nasty...house.

748
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:23,945
别动
Hands off.

749
00:46:23,945 --> 00:46:26,295
抱歉,不打扰你了
Sorry. I'll leave you to it.

750
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,673
这很容易
Oh, it's child's play.

751
00:46:44,673 --> 00:46:47,105
是用音乐写的数学题
It's um... It's musical mathematics.

752
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:47,751
你看看
Don't you see? 

753
00:46:47,751 --> 00:46:51,522
只要把音符和字母对上
One simply transposes the music from notes into letters.

754
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:53,284
这两个八度
So two octaves...

755
00:46:54,683 --> 00:46:58,508
是A到O,这11个升音
take us from A up to O, while these 11 sharps

756
00:46:58,508 --> 00:47:00,439
是直到Z
bring us all the way up to Z.

757
00:47:00,439 --> 00:47:03,977
密信就解开了.啦啦啦!
Your coded letter. La! La-la!

758
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:08,159
拜托了,可别奉承我
Please, I cannot abide flattery.

759
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,891
谢谢你,瑞佛小姐
Thank you, Lady Revel. Thank you.

760
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:13,880
不客气   谢谢你,班铎
Very well.   Thank you, Bundle.

761
00:47:15,476 --> 00:47:18,678
因为这样,我挚爱的上尉...
"For this reason, my beloved Captain...

762
00:47:18,678 --> 00:47:20,531
我们不能再见面了
I can never see you again.

763
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:24,976
请答应我,你有一天会回来取回最珍贵的珠宝
Promise me you will return one day for the greatest jewel.

764
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:27,799
里士满二十,向北,三,向东
Richmond Twenty, North Three East."

765
00:47:27,799 --> 00:47:29,913
死人口袋里的情书
A love letter in the dead man's pocket.

766
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:33,263
不完整,如果我们能多拿到几页,或有个日期就好了
Incomplete. If we had a couple more pages a date'd be helpful.

767
00:47:33,263 --> 00:47:36,760
不过手稿是用圆珠笔写的
Yes, though the manuscript was written in ballpoint pen.

768
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,132
没错.那么说是这几年写的
Indeed. So, the last couple of years. Yes.

769
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:41,387
是告别信吗?
Oh. A farewell?

770
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:44,548
"挚爱的上尉",上尉?
"Beloved Captain." Captain?

771
00:47:44,548 --> 00:47:47,189
路德维格伯爵的假名
An alias for Count Ludwig,

772
00:47:47,189 --> 00:47:49,532
是为了让这段情事保密吧?
if this affair was to be kept quiet?

773
00:47:49,532 --> 00:47:52,258
伯爵的秘密情人,是艾格尼丝吗?
The Count had a secret lover. Agnes?

774
00:47:52,314 --> 00:47:53,655
大概是
Perhaps.

775
00:47:53,758 --> 00:47:55,699
但这怎么解释?
But what do we make of this?

776
00:47:55,699 --> 00:47:59,995
请答应我,你有一天会回来取回最珍贵的珠宝
"Promise me you will return one day for the greatest jewel."

777
00:47:59,995 --> 00:48:02,776
是不是...?   路德维格伯爵回到烟囱大厦
Is it possible...?   Count Ludwig came here to Chimneys

778
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:05,093
不是为了铁矿,是为了更秘密的事情
not to discuss iron, but on a secret mission, 

779
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:07,805
从信的内容来看,是为了取回被偷的迈索尔钻石
revealed within this letter, to recover the stolen Mysore Diamond

780
00:48:07,805 --> 00:48:10,241
而这钻石就在这栋房子里的某个地方
located somewhere in this house.

781
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:11,935
怪不得要用密码写呢
No wonder it's in code.

782
00:48:13,087 --> 00:48:15,412
所以他是为了这个想买下烟囱大厦
That's why he wanted to buy Chimneys.

783
00:48:15,412 --> 00:48:18,687
“里士满二十,向北,三,向东”
"Richmond Twenty, North Three East."

784
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,373
线索近在眼前啊
The evidence was before our eyes.

785
00:48:20,373 --> 00:48:22,337
凡代克的画?   他画的内容
The Van Dyck?   And the subject?

786
00:48:22,337 --> 00:48:24,297
里士满公爵
The Duke of Richmond.

787
00:48:29,551 --> 00:48:32,254
18,19,20
18, 19, 20.

788
00:48:36,063 --> 00:48:37,470
就在这吗?
So?

789
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:39,534
就是这吧
So.

790
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:42,809
被折磨我探长
Don't torment me, Inspector.

791
00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:46,146
你要是知道什么...    奇,奇...
If you're holding something back...   Want, want...

792
00:48:46,146 --> 00:48:47,378
他的遗言
His last words.

793
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:50,255
除非...
Unless, of course...

794
00:48:50,255 --> 00:48:52,889
墙,墙
Vunt, vunt...

795
00:48:53,003 --> 00:48:56,823
除非他说的不是英语,而是他的母语
Unless of course he was speaking not English, but his mother tongue.

796
00:48:56,823 --> 00:48:59,179
不是"奇,奇",而是"墙,墙"
Not "want, want", but "vunt, vunt".

797
00:49:00,997 --> 00:49:02,983
是德语的"墙"
"Der Wand" in High German.

798
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,610
或者是带有奥地利口音的"墙"
Or "vunt" in the Austrian dialect.

799
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:06,723
什么意思呢?
Meaning?

800
00:49:06,723 --> 00:49:08,862
墙,墙
The wall, the wall.

801
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,683
你觉得是...?
So, you think...? 

802
00:49:10,683 --> 00:49:15,311
你觉得钻石是藏在墙里什么地方吗?
You think the diamond is hidden somewhere in the wall?

803
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:22,184
嗯,很好啊
Well. Bravo.

804
00:49:22,685 --> 00:49:24,378
不过,我觉得有个人能帮我们的忙
But, you know, I think I know a gentleman

805
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,720
不过,我觉得有个人能帮我们的忙
who might shed a little more light on the matter.

806
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,985
你当晚是陪你教母来的吗?
You were accompanying your godmother?

807
00:49:29,205 --> 00:49:31,245
叫...   索梅塞夫人
Lady...    Lady Somerset.

808
00:49:31,245 --> 00:49:34,830
没错.我们以前都叫她罗比
That's right. We all used to call her Robbie.

809
00:49:37,662 --> 00:49:39,140
一定很迷人
Must have been quite bewitching.

810
00:49:40,398 --> 00:49:42,408
什么?   钻石
What?   The diamond.

811
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:45,197
哦,是的
Oh. I see.

812
00:49:45,197 --> 00:49:48,518
对于我来说就是有颜色的石头罢了,探长
Well, it's all just coloured glass to me, Inspector.

813
00:49:51,146 --> 00:49:52,863
你那里是什么?
What, what have you got there?

814
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:56,024
32年的调查记录
Notes from the investigation in '32.

815
00:49:56,966 --> 00:49:59,702
也包括你的口供
Interviews with, among others, yourself.

816
00:49:59,702 --> 00:50:03,668
"我完全不记得钻石什么时候没有的"
"I have no recollection of said diamond's disappearance.

817
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,430
"我当时在睡觉呢"
In fact, I was asleep."

818
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:09,145
我从清晨就起来到处忙活了,说真的,探长
I'd been charging about since dawn. Really, Inspector...

819
00:50:09,145 --> 00:50:11,217
我注意到索梅塞夫人也很早就休息了
I see Lady Somerset retired early as well.

820
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:15,085
我们跟偷窃毫无关系,我向你保证
We had nothing to do with any theft, I assure you.

821
00:50:17,111 --> 00:50:18,701
是这样的
The point is...

822
00:50:19,536 --> 00:50:21,152
你看
See for yourself.

823
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:24,737
我那时年轻
I was a young rake.

824
00:50:26,395 --> 00:50:28,512
她又很容易上道
She was easily led.

825
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,421
我懂了
I see.

826
00:50:31,978 --> 00:50:34,504
至少也知道个大概了
Well, at least, I have an inkling.

827
00:50:35,965 --> 00:50:38,545
他使用笔名写的吗
And he was writing under a nom de plume.

828
00:50:38,594 --> 00:50:41,908
路德维格伯爵有个假名?   嗯   上尉
Count Ludwig had an alias?    Mm-hm.   The Captain.

829
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,070
奇怪
Odd.

830
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:46,437
还有个秘密情人呢,信里面都写着呢
And a secret lover, to boot. It's all in the letter.

831
00:50:46,437 --> 00:50:48,936
谁是他的情人呢?
Who was she, the lover?

832
00:50:48,936 --> 00:50:51,559
我们猜是艾格尼丝   可怜的艾格尼丝
We wondered. Agnes?    Poor Agnes.

833
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:53,698
不仅如此,伯爵好像跟钻石失窃还有关系
Not only that. The Count seems to have had a hand 

834
00:50:53,698 --> 00:50:55,536
不仅如此,伯爵好像跟钻石失窃还有关系
in the theft of the famous diamond.

835
00:50:55,536 --> 00:50:57,326
他把她甩了,是吗?
So he bumped her off, did he?

836
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,460
两个贼分赃不均?
Two thieves fighting over the spoils?

837
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,585
你们吃啊
Well, do start away, everyone.

838
00:51:02,585 --> 00:51:05,414
她不是唯一的一个,不是吗?
Yes, and she wasn't the only one, was she?

839
00:51:05,713 --> 00:51:07,723
唯一的受害者
The only victim, I mean.

840
00:51:07,723 --> 00:51:09,980
比尔,那个什么...
Bill, where is the...?

841
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,399
就在这里,亲爱的
Right here, my dearest.

842
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:22,401
烟囱大厦,缩放版的
Chimneys. Not quite to scale, I'm afraid.

843
00:51:22,517 --> 00:51:25,265
谋杀的那晚,我们都在楼下
The night of the murder. We all came downstairs.

844
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:29,249
没错吧?我们找不到伯爵了,所以就分头找
Yes? And we couldn't find the Count, so off we all went.

845
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:31,960
我们是分开的.是这样的
Separately. Now, this is the point.

846
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,426
我们都聚在这里
This is where we all were.

847
00:51:33,426 --> 00:51:36,645
班铎,你在客房那边找
So, Bundle, you were upstairs in the guest wing.

848
00:51:37,216 --> 00:51:38,536
乔治也是
George was there also.

849
00:51:38,818 --> 00:51:40,378
柴德维尔在厨房
Treadwell, kitchen.

850
00:51:41,049 --> 00:51:43,327
贝金索普小姐,在外面的空地上
Miss Blenkinsopp, I believe, was on the terrace.

851
00:51:43,327 --> 00:51:44,512
比尔在书房
Bill study

852
00:51:44,512 --> 00:51:47,741
我先去了楼上,然后下楼到了会议室
and I was upstairs then down to the council chamber.

853
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:51,001
我们离开有... 有五分钟吗,比尔?
We were all gone what...? Ah, five minutes, Bill?

854
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,201
没错
Absolutely.

855
00:51:52,201 --> 00:51:53,407
至多一两分钟
One or two at most.

856
00:51:53,407 --> 00:51:54,991
然后... 枪响!
Then... Gunshot!

857
00:51:54,991 --> 00:51:57,469
我们都涌回到房子里,前门是大敞着的
Back we all flew, front door wide open.

858
00:51:57,469 --> 00:51:59,106
关上那扇门!
Someone close that door!

859
00:51:59,106 --> 00:51:59,958
没错吧
Agreed?

860
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:01,209
对
Yeah.

861
00:52:01,372 --> 00:52:05,242
谁能说不会是我们之中的某个人跑到房子外
Who's to say one of us couldn't have run out of the house

862
00:52:05,242 --> 00:52:09,027
穿过花园,活板门,进入通道,杀了伯爵
through the garden, trapdoor, into the passage, shot the Count

863
00:52:09,027 --> 00:52:11,265
枪响之后再用一分钟跑回来
and then one minute to get back, after the gunshot, 

864
00:52:11,265 --> 00:52:13,088
看起来好像...
in time to make it look like...

865
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:17,241
好像我们一直都在这里呢?
well, to make it look like we'd been in the house all along?

866
00:52:18,811 --> 00:52:20,523
前门到活板门是...
Front door to the trapdoor is...

867
00:52:20,523 --> 00:52:22,253
多少步,比尔?
How many strides, Bill?

868
00:52:22,253 --> 00:52:25,099
我们量过了,112步?112步
We measured it. 112? 112.

869
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:27,053
五分钟内跑个来回是有可能的
Five minutes there and back. It's possible. 

870
00:52:27,053 --> 00:52:28,897
你自己也这么说的,不是吗,比尔?
You said so yourself, didn't you, Bill?

871
00:52:29,534 --> 00:52:30,571
是的
Sure.

872
00:52:30,668 --> 00:52:31,835
但是我们为什么要...
But why would anybody here...? 

873
00:52:31,835 --> 00:52:33,584
伯爵想买烟囱大厦,不是吗?
The Count wanted Chimneys, didn't he?

874
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:34,798
你们都听到他说了
And you all heard him say that.

875
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:38,404
班铎,你那么反对卖房子
And, Bundle, you're so mortally opposed to losing the house.

876
00:52:38,404 --> 00:52:40,998
我还没意识到自己至于这么绝望呢
I had no idea I was so pathetically grasping.

877
00:52:40,998 --> 00:52:42,298
反正有人杀了他不是吗?
Well, somebody killed him, didn't they? 

878
00:52:42,298 --> 00:52:43,937
至于那个死去的可怜女孩...
And as for that poor dead girl...

879
00:52:43,937 --> 00:52:47,829
我的小机灵鬼.你需要休整一下
My little fox. What you need is fattening up.

880
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:50,329
够了   是够了
Enough.    Quite.

881
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:56,047
你打算把这些都记下来吗,贝金索普?
You making notes, Blenkinsopp?

882
00:52:56,824 --> 00:52:57,257
没有啊
No.

883
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,797
等你回到市政厅这一切就会传为"佳话"了
To think, what a pleasing oral history this will all make

884
00:53:00,797 --> 00:53:02,922
等你回到市政厅这一切就会传为"佳话"了
back in your municipal headquarters.

885
00:53:02,922 --> 00:53:03,620
不是的
Not at all.

886
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:06,580
大家都知道你打烟囱大厦的主意有好几年了
When everyone knows you've had your claws in Chimneys for years,

887
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,164
孜孜不倦地想办法,写信,通知
grubbing about with your letters and your polite notices,

888
00:53:10,164 --> 00:53:12,815
管我们家的闲事,给我们债权人漏消息
rifling through our drawers, tipping off our creditors.

889
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,665
我妈妈当时病危在床呢
Mother was on her death bed,

890
00:53:14,665 --> 00:53:16,754
你倒是心安理得
not that you lost a moment's sleep over that.

891
00:53:16,754 --> 00:53:19,395
真不知道你为了那般   我来告诉你吧
God knows why.   I'll tell you why.

892
00:53:19,565 --> 00:53:22,236
我发现她在书房里
I caught her in the study,

893
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:27,051
查看以前的家务记录,是不是?1932年的
going through the old housekeeping records, weren't you? 1932.

894
00:53:27,944 --> 00:53:30,881
你是为了艾格尼丝,是不是?   你认识她?
This is all about Agnes, isn't it?   You knew her?

895
00:53:30,978 --> 00:53:33,049
艾格尼丝帕克是个孩子
Agnes Parker was a child,

896
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:37,248
当她到你们这里的时候还是个孩子
a child when she was handed over to people like you.

897
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:39,381
她家人信任你们能对她好
Trusted to your care.

898
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:42,802
有一天她突然就没了,她的家人心都碎了
And when one morning she wasn't there, it broke her family's heart.

899
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:46,488
你们却没人在乎到底发生了什么
And not one of you had the decency to ask why.

900
00:53:46,488 --> 00:53:49,139
我不舒服   你该不舒服
I feel sick.   Well, you might.

901
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:51,777
不是的,我不舒服
No, I feel sick.

902
00:53:53,486 --> 00:53:55,204
爸爸?   克莱门特?
Daddy?   Clement?

903
00:53:55,577 --> 00:53:56,804
哦,他该服药了
Oh, it's his ticker.

904
00:53:56,804 --> 00:53:59,923
你的补药呢?你的补药?    少陪了
Where's your tonic? Your tonic!   Excuse me.

905
00:54:00,495 --> 00:54:03,165
都要没了,就喝一大口吧
There's hardly any left. Just take a swig.

906
00:54:03,454 --> 00:54:05,446
失陪   该死的汤
Excuse me.   Damn soup.

907
00:54:08,179 --> 00:54:09,300
我们去呼吸点新鲜空气
Let's get some fresh air.

908
00:54:10,403 --> 00:54:13,469
对不起,真对不起
I'm so sorry. I'm so terribly sorry.

909
00:54:14,246 --> 00:54:16,849
柴德维尔小姐,这是什么样汤?
What kind of soup is this, Miss Treadwell?

910
00:54:17,249 --> 00:54:20,771
蘑菇和鼠尾草,但是你没事啊
Mushroom and sage. But you are quite well.

911
00:54:20,771 --> 00:54:23,904
哦,我晚上没什么胃口
Oh, I have no appetite by nightfall.

912
00:54:23,904 --> 00:54:26,728
上了年纪就这样
One of the hidden costs of old age.

913
00:54:28,116 --> 00:54:30,413
柴德维尔小姐,我有事想问你
Miss Treadwell, help me here.

914
00:54:30,413 --> 00:54:35,617
你确定是伯爵杀了可怜的艾格尼丝吗?
Are you quite sure in your mind that the Count murdered poor Agnes?

915
00:54:36,546 --> 00:54:38,655
你还看到什么了吗,请你告诉我
If there's anything else, then, please...?

916
00:54:39,236 --> 00:54:41,218
已经很多年了
It's been so many years.

917
00:54:57,357 --> 00:55:00,341
不能等早上再做这个吗?   不能
Can this not wait until the morning?   No.

918
00:55:03,219 --> 00:55:04,803
熔丝
Fuse wire.

919
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,449
怎么会在这里出现呢?
Now, what's that doing there?

920
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,461
说的是啊
Indeed.

921
00:55:09,461 --> 00:55:11,646
天啊,这是怎么回事
Dear me, what a business.

922
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:15,686
啊,没错
Ah, yes.

923
00:55:15,686 --> 00:55:17,758
毛地黄的叶子
Foxglove leaves.

924
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,216
很容易和鼠尾草弄混
Easily muddled with sage.

925
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,479
肯定是被放进汤里了
Must have found their way into the soup.

926
00:55:22,884 --> 00:55:25,006
毛地黄,它含有...
Foxglove, you see, contains...

927
00:55:25,006 --> 00:55:27,721
洋地黄,有毒性的.我进屋了
Digitalis. Natural poison. I'll be indoors.

928
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,556
抱歉
Sorry.

929
00:55:51,136 --> 00:55:52,487
简
Jane.

930
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,036
你来指责我的吗?
Here to rebuke me?

931
00:55:55,975 --> 00:55:57,638
说吧
Castigate away.

932
00:55:59,514 --> 00:56:00,330
不是
No.

933
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,408
不是的,你姐姐说的那些
No. Your sister's account of last night.

934
00:56:05,408 --> 00:56:08,476
别管金妮说什么.她受了很大打击
Please don't mind Ginny. Her nerves are shot.

935
00:56:08,895 --> 00:56:13,284
我记得你在找伯爵的时候是在楼上客房这边的
I noticed that you were upstairs, here in the guest wing,

936
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:15,244
我记得你在找伯爵的时候是在楼上客房这边的
during the search party,

937
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:17,779
所以我在想你把那些东西放在哪里了
and I wondered what became of them.

938
00:56:18,919 --> 00:56:19,438
什么?
Of...?

939
00:56:19,438 --> 00:56:23,584
那些法律文件,有关卖掉烟囱大厦的文件
The legal paperwork, drawn up last night for the sale of Chimneys,

940
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:26,539
你从洛马克斯先生那里拿走的那些
which you took from Mr Lomax's room.

941
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,586
哦,那个啊
Oh, that.

942
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:36,764
我是为了爸爸拿的,主要是为了他
Well, I did it for father's sake, in the main.

943
00:56:37,322 --> 00:56:39,664
烟囱大厦曾经是他的一切
Chimneys meant everything to him once.

944
00:56:40,343 --> 00:56:42,705
我们在这房子里曾有很美好的记忆
We used to have such housing days.

945
00:56:42,705 --> 00:56:44,973
他退休以后,我们真正像一家人
After his retirement, as a family.

946
00:56:46,438 --> 00:56:48,694
但是妈妈死后...
But of course with mama gone...

947
00:56:52,168 --> 00:56:56,092
我能理解他的伤心,记忆啊,什么的,但是...
I understand he's upset, memories and so forth, but...

948
00:56:56,092 --> 00:56:57,675
时间会治愈一切的
given time. 

949
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,034
像我们家其他人那样,我...
And like the rest of my family, I have ah... 

950
00:57:02,034 --> 00:57:04,298
我并不是个很有激情的人
I have not much use of a passion

951
00:57:04,298 --> 00:57:07,173
我有这么个大房子可以打理
I'm now chore such a great house.

952
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:10,446
确实打理的很好
Does make Verk ward alive.

953
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:13,958
那些文件呢
Now these papers.

954
00:57:19,441 --> 00:57:22,401
老处女最后的避难所,不是吗?
Old maid's last refuge, isn't it?

955
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:27,012
对宠物过分的溺爱
An overweening love of domestic animals.

956
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:31,504
他们倒是没怎么回报我的爱
Not that they ever reciprocated.

957
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,448
他们总是喜欢柴德维尔
It was always Treadwell.

958
00:57:35,762 --> 00:57:38,142
每只我们养过的狗狗
Every dog and pup we ever had.

959
00:57:39,586 --> 00:57:41,498
她总是给他们起些个好笑的名字
She used to give them the funniest names.

960
00:58:10,846 --> 00:58:13,940
你没必要留在这里,先生   啊,我没事
There's really no need to stay, sir.   Ah, I'm fine.

961
00:58:17,288 --> 00:58:21,240
她心脏不好吗?   嗯,我不清楚
She had a weak heart?    Well, not that I knew.

962
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:27,156
哦,我就是想不通毛地黄毒怎么对她是致命的,对其他人就...
Oh, I wondered merely why the poison in the foxglove leaves

963
00:58:27,156 --> 00:58:30,843
哦,我就是想不通毛地黄毒怎么对她是致命的,对其他人就...
should prove lethal for her while the rest of us...

964
00:58:30,843 --> 00:58:33,989
她确实操心很多
Well... she was a terrible worrier.

965
00:58:42,474 --> 00:58:44,776
27年上海买的
Shanghai. '27.

966
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,954
她跟着我们到处走
She travelled about with us everywhere.

967
00:58:50,211 --> 00:58:51,203
这个呢?
And this one?

968
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:57,002
哦...你知道吗,我不知道那是什么
Oh... Do you know, I have no idea.

969
00:58:57,002 --> 00:58:59,007
我们的上尉写的
Our friend the Captain.

970
00:58:59,007 --> 00:59:01,220
都是上尉写的?   看起来是的
All of them?    Looks like it.

971
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,482
也不是音符密码
And not in musical code.

972
00:59:03,482 --> 00:59:04,291
这些不是
Not this one.

973
00:59:05,234 --> 00:59:06,923
他写给谁的?
Who was he writing to?

974
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:09,622
康斯坦斯?
Constance?

975
00:59:11,706 --> 00:59:14,435
她跟我们在一起那么多年了
She was with us for so many years.

976
00:59:14,435 --> 00:59:17,003
都忘记她还有教名了
One forgot she even had a Christian name.

977
00:59:18,089 --> 00:59:20,457
康斯坦斯柴德维尔
Constance Treadwell.

978
00:59:20,961 --> 00:59:24,216
我就觉得她对我们有所隐瞒
I was so sure she was holding something from us.

979
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:28,878
康斯坦斯是路德维格伯爵的情人?
Constance was Count Ludwig's lover?

980
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,974
我最亲爱的康斯坦斯
My dearest Constance.

981
00:59:33,628 --> 00:59:37,232
离公爵府的宴会只有九天了
Nine days until the party at the Palazzo Ducale.

982
00:59:37,801 --> 00:59:39,840
感觉是煎熬
It feels like a prison sentence...

983
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,181
自从加拉加斯的那天每天都在下雨   上尉
It has rained every day since Caracas.    The Captain.

984
00:59:43,181 --> 00:59:46,186
我疯了,为爱疯狂了
I am mad, bedlamism, with love.

985
00:59:46,186 --> 00:59:49,363
但是"小羊羔"急的都跺脚了
But the lamb is stamping her little hooves.

986
00:59:49,363 --> 00:59:51,198
我得停笔了
I must sign off now.

987
00:59:51,198 --> 00:59:52,673
请你勇敢
Be of courage.

988
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:55,555
周五在烟囱大厦见,带着我全部的爱
Until Friday and Chimneys. All my love.

989
00:59:55,555 --> 00:59:57,626
将再与你相见
...Our glorious reunion.

990
00:59:57,819 --> 01:00:00,144
重新将你拥入怀中
I will take you in my arms.

991
01:00:00,144 --> 01:00:05,227
我们再次奏响美丽的音乐
And we will make such light-fingered music."

992
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:09,491
柴德维尔?   我想她大概有所顾忌吧
Treadwell?   I suppose she had much to lose.

993
01:00:09,491 --> 01:00:11,606
她的位置,她的生计
Her position, her livelihood.

994
01:00:11,606 --> 01:00:16,008
当一份爱情转入地下的时候,激情很快就耗尽了
And when love is driven underground, it quickens its ardour.

995
01:00:18,598 --> 01:00:21,749
我们曾有过这种状况,圣玛丽米德的风琴师和为他翻页的...
Oh, we had a case with our organist

996
01:00:21,749 --> 01:00:24,354
我们曾有过这种状况,圣玛丽米德的风琴师和为他翻页的...
and a young page turner at St Mary Mead.

997
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:25,568
是嘛
I see.

998
01:00:26,184 --> 01:00:28,504
不该说人家的闲话
Well, one mustn't talk scandal.

999
01:00:30,051 --> 01:00:34,792
时间,地点,威尼斯,加拉加斯
Places and times. Venice, Caracas.

1000
01:00:34,792 --> 01:00:38,135
他肯定是跟着她至少两年了
He must have trailed her for two years at least.

1001
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,599
一直跟到烟囱大厦   到宴会那晚
All the way to Chimneys.   Back to the party.

1002
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,728
但是柴德维尔,会偷钻石吗?
But Treadwell, a diamond thief?

1003
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:50,766
也许是上尉鼓动她做的?
Well, perhaps it was the Captain who urged her to do it?

1004
01:00:51,465 --> 01:00:53,886
"小羊羔"是什么意思?
What is the "lamb" in these letters?

1005
01:00:53,886 --> 01:00:55,144
那是...   我想是...
That's...   Well, I think...

1006
01:00:55,144 --> 01:00:57,773
哦,不好意思.你说吧
Oh, I'm so sorry. You first.

1007
01:00:59,074 --> 01:01:02,701
艾格尼丝.以前天主教用来代指羊羔的
Agnes. Old papist word for lamb.

1008
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,516
艾格尼丝代,上帝的羔羊
Agnes Dei. Lamb of God.

1009
01:01:05,087 --> 01:01:08,220
祭台助手   浪费青春
Altar boy.   Misspent youth.

1010
01:01:10,605 --> 01:01:12,798
所以我们能够推断出艾格尼丝帕克是传信的
So, safe to conclude Agnes Parker was the courier,

1011
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:15,569
为康斯坦斯柴德维尔和她的"上尉"传递信件
ferrying letters between Constance Treadwell and her "Captain".

1012
01:01:15,818 --> 01:01:18,749
然后,32年宴会那晚
And then, on the night of the party in '32,

1013
01:01:18,749 --> 01:01:20,448
迈索尔钻石被盗
the theft of the Mysore Diamond...

1014
01:01:20,448 --> 01:01:21,722
艾格尼丝被谋杀了
Agnes is murdered.

1015
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:24,910
差不多是这样,但是为什么杀信使呢
Wildly circumstantial, but the messenger,

1016
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:28,716
路德维格伯爵杀了她是因为她发现偷钻石的事了吗?
murdered by Count Ludwig because she found out about the theft?

1017
01:01:28,716 --> 01:01:31,852
她知道的太多了,上尉就把她埋了
She knew too much, the Count buries her in the crypt, and, of course,

1018
01:01:31,852 --> 01:01:34,603
大家就会以为是艾格尼丝偷的钻石
everyone assumes that Agnes has stolen the diamond.

1019
01:01:35,156 --> 01:01:39,431
然后,多年之后,两个情人都死了
And then, years later, the two lovers dead themselves.

1020
01:01:39,431 --> 01:01:40,453
或者被杀了
Or murdered.

1021
01:01:41,055 --> 01:01:43,388
那该死的汤.这就让人不禁要问
That wretched soup. Which begs the question...

1022
01:01:43,388 --> 01:01:46,399
为什么同样的汤杀了一个人却只是让其他人不舒服呢
How can the same dish kill one of us 

1023
01:01:46,399 --> 01:01:49,660
为什么同样的汤杀了一个人却只是让其他人不舒服呢
while provoking mere unpleasantness in the rest?

1024
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:52,435
毛地黄是凶手加在汤里的
The foxgloves tossed into the soup by the killer

1025
01:01:52,435 --> 01:01:55,328
让我们觉得柴德维尔小姐的死是个意外
to convince us that Miss Treadwell's death was an accident.

1026
01:01:55,706 --> 01:01:58,315
但是实际上她确是中了别的毒死的
But, in fact, she was poisoned by something else.

1027
01:01:58,315 --> 01:01:59,276
什么毒呢?
But what?

1028
01:01:59,276 --> 01:02:01,686
我不知道   真可惜
I have no idea.   Pity.

1029
01:02:02,582 --> 01:02:04,531
想想我们中间是谁最先为艾格尼丝帕克挺身而出呢?
And who among us, I wonder, 

1030
01:02:04,531 --> 01:02:07,857
想想我们中间是谁最先为艾格尼丝帕克挺身而出呢?
has been quickest to defend poor Agnes Parker?

1031
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:10,418
是的,我们上一所学校
Yes. I was at school with her.

1032
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:12,526
他们家跟我家在一条街上
They lived on our street.

1033
01:02:14,621 --> 01:02:18,224
艾格尼丝的这件事...
This whole business with Agnes, well...

1034
01:02:19,706 --> 01:02:21,643
他们就是这么对待下人的,是不是?
It's how they treat them, isn't it?

1035
01:02:21,643 --> 01:02:26,312
你一直不相信是艾格尼丝在32年偷走了迈索尔钻石的,是不是?
You never believed Agnes stole the Mysore Diamond in '32, did you?

1036
01:02:26,312 --> 01:02:29,755
当然不信了,但是我没袭击谁
Of course not. But I didn't knock anyone off.

1037
01:02:29,755 --> 01:02:32,406
我对下毒的事也一点不知道
And I certainly don't know anything about any poison.

1038
01:02:32,406 --> 01:02:34,187
地黄...地什么...
Digi... digi...

1039
01:02:34,187 --> 01:02:38,584
但是你当时在这里...楼前的空地上
And yet here you are...on the terrace.

1040
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:40,474
路德维格伯爵!
Count Ludwig!

1041
01:02:40,474 --> 01:02:42,575
就你自己,没有证人
Quite alone. No witnesses.

1042
01:02:42,575 --> 01:02:43,660
我们怎么想呢?
What do we think? 

1043
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:47,082
会不会是贝金索普小姐爬进通道
Could it be that Miss Blenkinsopp climbed into the passage,

1044
01:02:47,082 --> 01:02:51,153
开了枪...   啊...   然后又回到屋里呢?
fired the gunshot...   Ah   ..then back in the house?

1045
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:54,370
我看是没什么可能
I don't think so.

1046
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:56,986
我的气喘很重
Not with my asthma.

1047
01:02:56,986 --> 01:02:59,247
但是你看到什么了,是不是?
And yet, you saw something, didn't you?

1048
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:04,191
是的
Yes.

1049
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:07,938
我现在想想我看到的一定是凯德在花园里
I realise now it must have been Cade I saw in the garden.

1050
01:03:07,938 --> 01:03:11,127
他形迹可疑,不太像是保安
It did seem odd behaviour for a security guard.

1051
01:03:11,127 --> 01:03:14,345
我当时要是说点什么,叫人帮忙
I could have said something, cried for help.

1052
01:03:14,642 --> 01:03:16,046
我本可以阻止悲剧的发生的
I could have stopped it,

1053
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:18,129
但我只是傻站着
but I just stood there.

1054
01:03:31,651 --> 01:03:34,162
你说的很对,探长
You're absolutely right, Inspector.

1055
01:03:35,835 --> 01:03:38,701
我想凯德先生快要没洞可钻了
I fear Mr Cade is running out of rope.

1056
01:03:41,028 --> 01:03:43,434
埃弗斯利先生
Mr Eversleigh.

1057
01:03:44,314 --> 01:03:45,363
看这个
Here we are.

1058
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,149
"亲爱的凯德,来烟囱大厦"
"Dear Cade. Come to Chimneys.

1059
01:03:48,149 --> 01:03:51,694
"花园里有个活板门,11点45分整"
There's a trapdoor in the garden. 11:45 sharp."

1060
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,000
是编出来的
Patent falsehood.

1061
01:03:53,505 --> 01:03:56,747
是的,看到大写的C了吗?
Yes, well. Note the capital C?

1062
01:03:57,291 --> 01:04:00,214
字母上有个缺口,看到了吗?
The letter has a little crack in it. Do you see?

1063
01:04:00,214 --> 01:04:03,835
再看这里,有一样的缺口
And again here, the same little crack.

1064
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:05,507
那又如何?
So?

1065
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:08,279
寄给凯德先生的便条看来是这台打字机打出来的
The note to Mr Cade appears to have been written 

1066
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:09,774
寄给凯德先生的便条看来是这台打字机打出来的
on this very typewriter.

1067
01:04:09,774 --> 01:04:11,248
而在送信的那天早上,是你在用这台打字机
Which you yourself were using 

1068
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:13,836
而在送信的那天早上,是你在用这台打字机
on the very morning the letter was dispatched.

1069
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,417
哦,是这样
Oh, I see.

1070
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:18,136
这是你写的,对不对?
You wrote this, didn't you?

1071
01:04:19,413 --> 01:04:22,759
一部分是我写的
Yes. Well, some of it, anyway.

1072
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:25,206
我没写11点45整
But I don't remember anything about 11:45.

1073
01:04:25,206 --> 01:04:27,255
但是你让他来的?
But your purpose in writing the letter?

1074
01:04:29,062 --> 01:04:31,364
你在帮助凯德先生进入烟囱大厦?
To help Mr Cade gain access to Chimneys?

1075
01:04:32,515 --> 01:04:34,442
你跟凯德先生认识多久了?
How long have you been acquainted with Mr Cade?

1076
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:35,988
几周了
Couple of weeks.

1077
01:04:36,461 --> 01:04:38,275
我赌牌输了不少钱
I lost rather heavily at cards.

1078
01:04:38,914 --> 01:04:41,557
这是我的恶习,赌牌
My pet vice, losing heavily at cards.

1079
01:04:42,116 --> 01:04:44,521
办公室的工作太无聊了
I get so crashingly bored in the office.

1080
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:48,142
奥德维奇码头那里有个小屋子
There's a little room run in Aldwych, pontoon,

1081
01:04:48,142 --> 01:04:49,670
那些迷上玩牌的人会去
poker for the die-hards.

1082
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:51,195
你输了多少?
How much did you lose?

1083
01:04:52,902 --> 01:04:54,363
97镑
97 quid.

1084
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:59,544
反正,凯德来找我,说他能帮我偿清赌债
Anyway, in walked Cade. Said he could cover the debt.

1085
01:04:59,544 --> 01:05:01,147
我们可以互相帮忙
He said we could help each other out.

1086
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:03,422
继续说
Go on.

1087
01:05:06,914 --> 01:05:07,810
弗吉尼亚
Virginia.

1088
01:05:11,514 --> 01:05:14,033
我在想你是不是该这么轻易就推掉乔治的求婚
I do wonder if you shouldn't have dismiss George's offer so lightly.

1089
01:05:14,033 --> 01:05:18,130
啊,安东尼,你就不能说点别的...   弗吉尼亚,求你了
Ah, Athony, like a stuck record. But you don't...   Virginia, please.

1090
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:24,023
我有话要告诉你
I have sort of a confession.

1091
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:26,511
我不是个好人
I'm not a good man.

1092
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:28,400
不怎么好
Not really.

1093
01:05:29,282 --> 01:05:35,153
哦?   我的搭档,吉米欧布莱恩,事实上
Oh?   My partner Jimmy O'Brian, the fact of the matter is that,

1094
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:38,861
如果我不帮他们拿到钻石,他们就要杀了他
that they were going to shoot him, if I didn't get them the diamond.

1095
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:41,412
什么?   凯德先生
What?   Mr. Cade.

1096
01:05:43,961 --> 01:05:44,707
听我说
Listen to me, 

1097
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:48,158
我在脑子里想了一遍又一遍要怎么跟你说
the number of times I've played it over and over again in my mind.

1098
01:05:48,158 --> 01:05:50,727
我很害怕会失去你
I was so scared that I'd loose you, you see?

1099
01:05:51,025 --> 01:05:52,910
我真的希望事情不是这个样子的
And I wish it weren't like this, I...

1100
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:55,748
我希望我们能回到过去重新开始一切
I wish we could go back to the beginning and start this dance again.

1101
01:05:55,748 --> 01:05:57,969
我,自行车,还有你
Me and the bicycle and you,

1102
01:05:57,969 --> 01:05:59,999
你是那么美丽,当我看着你的时候简直觉得疼
So beautiful that it hurts to look at you.

1103
01:06:02,362 --> 01:06:06,252
求你,不管你将要听到什么,请你相信我
Please, whatever you're about to hear, please, please believe me.

1104
01:06:06,252 --> 01:06:07,846
我确实是爱着你的
That I do love you.

1105
01:06:20,071 --> 01:06:23,459
这么说,有人在比勒陀利亚扣着你的朋友?
So, this gentleman from Pretoria who's holding your friend?

1106
01:06:24,434 --> 01:06:26,366
他们嗜赌,输了钱
He has a pet passion.

1107
01:06:27,658 --> 01:06:28,580
用钻石还债?
Diamonds?

1108
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,756
是的
Yes.

1109
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:32,595
迈索尔钻石?
The Mysore Diamond?

1110
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:39,129
他给我六周,让我拿到钻石
He gave me six weeks to bring him the real McCoy 

1111
01:06:40,158 --> 01:06:41,991
要不吉米就性命不保
or Jimmy's life would be forfeit.

1112
01:06:41,991 --> 01:06:46,409
那么是你策划了街头袭击弗吉尼亚以接近她?
So you staged the street assault to endear yourself to Virginia?

1113
01:06:47,822 --> 01:06:48,792
是的
Yes.

1114
01:06:48,792 --> 01:06:51,536
装好人接近并赢取弗吉尼亚的芳心
Posing as the good Samaritan to creep into 

1115
01:06:51,536 --> 01:06:53,253
装好人接近并赢取弗吉尼亚的芳心
the affections of an innocent young woman.   George, please, 

1116
01:06:53,253 --> 01:06:54,588
乔治,别说了
the affections of an innocent young woman.   George, please, 

1117
01:06:54,588 --> 01:06:55,878
我头疼
my head is splitting.

1118
01:06:56,423 --> 01:06:57,617
袭击是谁做的?
And the assailant?

1119
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:00,727
啊!
Agh!

1120
01:07:03,745 --> 01:07:04,840
对不起
Sorry.

1121
01:07:05,887 --> 01:07:08,483
你的真正目的是接近烟囱大厦
But your real purpose was to gain access to Chimneys, 

1122
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:10,259
因为钻石是在这丢的
where the diamond was first hidden.

1123
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:12,122
我是个正派的人   切
I am a decent man.   Pah.

1124
01:07:12,122 --> 01:07:15,289
我是个做了件傻事的正派人,我别无选择
A decent man who did a stupid thing. I had no choice.

1125
01:07:16,312 --> 01:07:18,033
我也是
Ditto. Absolutely.

1126
01:07:21,939 --> 01:07:23,963
安东尼凯德,我以涉嫌杀害路德维格冯斯坦伯爵的罪名逮捕你
Anthony Cade, I am arresting you

1127
01:07:23,963 --> 01:07:27,760
安东尼凯德,我以涉嫌杀害路德维格冯斯坦伯爵的罪名逮捕你
on suspicion of the murder of Count Ludwig Von Stainach.

1128
01:07:30,094 --> 01:07:31,431
给我滚!
Get out!

1129
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:36,733
我爱你
I love you.

1130
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:40,442
你也得跟我们走
And you.

1131
01:07:41,187 --> 01:07:42,953
我也是吗?
Really?

1132
01:07:48,834 --> 01:07:53,361
谁都别说话,拜托了,让我清静一会
Nobody say anything, please. Just for a moment.

1133
01:08:12,596 --> 01:08:15,583
我想不管发生了什么事,这个屋子是我最喜欢的了
I think, despite everything, 

1134
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:19,007
我想不管发生了什么事,这个屋子是我最喜欢的了
that this must be my favourite room in the world.

1135
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,661
我是个孩子的时候是不准进这个屋的
It was out of bounds as a boy,

1136
01:08:24,378 --> 01:08:28,463
所以我当然很想进来
so naturally it was where one longed to be.

1137
01:08:30,232 --> 01:08:32,673
这个甲胄
And this heraldic brute.

1138
01:08:33,763 --> 01:08:38,538
我曾想象他曾经历经征战,走过枪林弹雨
Oh, the battles we fought, through shot and shell.

1139
01:08:38,538 --> 01:08:42,746
想象军队,龙什么的
Armies, dragons, the whole works.

1140
01:08:42,746 --> 01:08:45,380
12岁那年的夏天
And one summer, 12 years old,

1141
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:49,002
我刚刚够高能够打开他的面甲
just tall enough to open his visor,

1142
01:08:49,936 --> 01:08:52,849
才发现他什么都不是
my brother in arms was nothing at all.

1143
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:54,354
里面只有空气而已
Just empty air.

1144
01:08:54,354 --> 01:08:56,550
如果你是在委婉地告诉我安东尼凯德不是白马王子
If this is you gently breaking the news 

1145
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:59,530
如果你是在委婉地告诉我安东尼凯德不是白马王子
that Anthony Cade is no knight in shining armour,

1146
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:01,693
那么我领会了
consider me rudely awoken.

1147
01:09:02,415 --> 01:09:04,588
不,不
No, no.

1148
01:09:05,486 --> 01:09:09,517
不是的,我是想说爱情是一场冒险
No, I'm saying that love is its own adventure.

1149
01:09:10,391 --> 01:09:14,720
别把任何人当做是白给的,近在眼前的人也是
Take no-one for granted, not even those closest to home.

1150
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:18,287
简,帮帮我   不,不用
Jane, help me.   No, no.

1151
01:09:20,341 --> 01:09:21,878
我明白你的意思
I know what you're saying.

1152
01:09:23,906 --> 01:09:25,023
祝我好运
Wish me luck.

1153
01:09:32,827 --> 01:09:36,626
对不起乔治,打扰你办国家大事了
Excuse me, George. Sorry to barge in on matters of state.

1154
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:39,173
我接受
I accept.

1155
01:09:40,856 --> 01:09:44,457
什么?   你的求婚,如果没过最后期限的话
I beg your pardon?   The offer. If it's still open.

1156
01:09:44,457 --> 01:09:46,987
我知道你很看重最后期限
I know how sticky you are about ultimata.

1157
01:09:46,987 --> 01:09:49,441
但是...凯德?
But... Cade?

1158
01:09:49,441 --> 01:09:52,263
那只是段白日梦罢了
Oh. That was a dream I had.

1159
01:09:52,263 --> 01:09:54,066
我现在清醒了
I'm awake now.

1160
01:09:54,726 --> 01:10:00,336
那,我很高兴听你这么说
Well, I'm delighted to hear it.

1161
01:10:02,506 --> 01:10:03,468
那好啊
Well.

1162
01:10:21,903 --> 01:10:23,417
很好啊
Well, well.

1163
01:10:24,124 --> 01:10:25,654
日子还长着呢,啊
The first of many.

1164
01:10:26,412 --> 01:10:30,573
喝一杯?香槟?得庆祝一下
A drink? Champagne. A toast!

1165
01:10:57,893 --> 01:10:58,532
你在干吗?
What are you doing?

1166
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:02,505
放开他!
Get off him!

1167
01:11:05,565 --> 01:11:06,723
你别动
You stay there.

1168
01:11:13,145 --> 01:11:14,383
弗吉尼亚
Virginia!

1169
01:11:17,828 --> 01:11:20,906
为我们干杯
A toast. To us.

1170
01:11:22,527 --> 01:11:26,595
干杯  干杯.干杯   干杯
Cheers.   Cheers. Cheers.    Cheers.

1171
01:11:50,175 --> 01:11:51,077
那是什么声啊?
What on earth was that?

1172
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:55,053
好像是房子里传出来的    不是,是通道里传出来的
It came from inside the house.   No, in the passageway.

1173
01:11:55,525 --> 01:11:57,059
先生,凯德跑了
Sir, Cade's escaped.

1174
01:11:58,319 --> 01:11:59,466
打开活板门
Try the trapdoor.

1175
01:12:00,495 --> 01:12:01,506
卡住了
It's stuck.

1176
01:12:07,653 --> 01:12:09,058
弗吉尼亚!
Virginia!

1177
01:12:09,808 --> 01:12:10,699
弗吉尼亚!
Virginia!

1178
01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:15,018
凯德先生,你这么做上了法庭会很不好看的
Mr Cade, all this isn't going to look very bright in court.

1179
01:12:15,018 --> 01:12:17,183
弗吉尼亚!我要你知道
Virginia! I want you to know.

1180
01:12:17,847 --> 01:12:20,651
我想给你一件东西 ―― 钻石
I want to give you something ―― the diamond.

1181
01:12:21,665 --> 01:12:23,300
我不在乎那东西
Not that I give a damn.

1182
01:12:23,986 --> 01:12:26,502
你是唯一值得我去为之而死的
You're the only prize worth dying for.

1183
01:12:27,633 --> 01:12:29,808
钻石就在这里
And it's got to be here somewhere.

1184
01:12:30,383 --> 01:12:33,796
我会找到它,交给你,你听到了吗?
And when I find it, it's yours. Do you hear?

1185
01:12:33,796 --> 01:12:35,290
安东尼!
Anthony!

1186
01:12:37,214 --> 01:12:38,243
好了!
Got it!

1187
01:12:43,114 --> 01:12:43,763
抓住他
It's him.

1188
01:12:45,624 --> 01:12:46,571
放开我
Get off me.

1189
01:12:47,749 --> 01:12:48,721
放开
Get off.

1190
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,776
他连这个也做不好
He couldn't even get that right.

1191
01:13:02,729 --> 01:13:04,523
想证明什么呀?
What's he trying to prove?

1192
01:13:04,523 --> 01:13:06,710
至少证明了一件事
Well, he has proven one thing.

1193
01:13:07,308 --> 01:13:09,499
哦?   他的清白
Oh?   His innocence.

1194
01:13:11,764 --> 01:13:13,327
我能给你们演示一下吗?
May I show you?

1195
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,291
抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1196
01:13:17,085 --> 01:13:18,936
你们准备好了就开始吧
Whenever you're ready.

1197
01:13:28,247 --> 01:13:29,921
大家都在位置上了吗?
Everybody in position?

1198
01:13:30,313 --> 01:13:32,200
在,在
Yes, yeah.

1199
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:32,900
好了
Ready.

1200
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:33,861
在
Yes.

1201
01:13:36,547 --> 01:13:38,479
好了警官,就等你了
Alright constable, when you're ready.

1202
01:13:46,394 --> 01:13:48,784
我们都站在那天晚上枪响的时候我们站的地方,是吗?
We were all standing just where we were 

1203
01:13:48,784 --> 01:13:51,252
我们都站在那天晚上枪响的时候我们站的地方,是吗?
the moment of the fatal gunshot. Agreed?

1204
01:13:51,252 --> 01:13:53,803
是的   情况是一模一样的吗?
Indeed.   Everything just as it was?

1205
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,797
不,枪响,太轻了
No. The gunshot, it was too quiet.

1206
01:13:57,797 --> 01:14:00,930
是的,枪响轻多了,探长
Yes, it was much quieter, Inspector.

1207
01:14:01,535 --> 01:14:04,348
想凯德先生刚刚砸锤子的声音
Like Mr Cade's hammering a few moments ago,

1208
01:14:04,348 --> 01:14:08,594
我们以为是枪响的那一声震得我的耳朵都疼了
whereas the sound we thought was the gunshot made my ears ring.

1209
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:12,407
凯德先生,你记得,在花园里
Mr Cade, you remember, out in the garden,

1210
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:15,395
那天晚上很暖和,你看到了什么?
what did he see on that warm night?

1211
01:14:16,144 --> 01:14:17,983
有人生火了
Someone had lit a fire.

1212
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:21,127
还有我们在垃圾箱里发现了一段电线
And then that off-cut of flex

1213
01:14:21,127 --> 01:14:23,396
完全不明白它为什么会出现在那里
that had no business being in the compost.

1214
01:14:23,396 --> 01:14:25,659
那是一段导火线,探长
A piece of fuse, Inspector.

1215
01:14:26,197 --> 01:14:30,130
杀害伯爵的人,那晚在烟囱里点了些东西
The Count's killer lit something in the chimney that evening.

1216
01:14:30,534 --> 01:14:35,099
利用导火线,设计好15分钟后会炸响
On a slow fuse, timed to explode 15 minutes later,

1217
01:14:35,099 --> 01:14:38,090
让我们以为我们听到的是枪响
to deceive us all that what we heard was a gunshot

1218
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:40,850
但实际上听到的是爆竹炸响
when what we, in fact, heard was a firework.

1219
01:14:43,366 --> 01:14:45,651
探长,记得你说过的话吗?
What was it you said, Inspector?

1220
01:14:45,651 --> 01:14:49,344
"不管怎么样,凯德先生都是在通道里被发现的"
"Like it or not, Anthony Cade was found in that tunnel 

1221
01:14:49,344 --> 01:14:50,799
"身旁还有尚有余温的抢呢"
with the smoking gun."

1222
01:14:51,555 --> 01:14:54,804
但是如果那枪已经冷了呢?
But what if the gun was not smoking?

1223
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:58,412
如果伯爵其实早就被射伤了
What if the Count was killed earlier than supposed,

1224
01:14:58,412 --> 01:15:02,130
在差一刻11点,男士们就寝之后
after the men retired from their business at quarter to eleven

1225
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:05,877
但是在一个小时后铃响之前呢?
but before the alarm bell almost an hour later?

1226
01:15:06,317 --> 01:15:09,904
这么一来,凶手就可能是我们之中任何人了
Suddenly, the killer could be any one of us.

1227
01:15:09,904 --> 01:15:10,833
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

1228
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:14,431
你记得伯爵在晚饭的时候,对里士满公爵画像表现出兴趣
You recall the Count's interest, over dinner,

1229
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:16,433
你记得伯爵在晚饭的时候,对里士满公爵画像表现出兴趣
in The Duke Of Richmond?

1230
01:15:16,999 --> 01:15:20,588
要是在我们都休息之后,悄悄把伯爵请下来
No great feat to quietly invite the Count back 

1231
01:15:20,588 --> 01:15:22,361
要是在我们都休息之后,悄悄把伯爵请下来
after the rest of us were in bed,

1232
01:15:22,403 --> 01:15:26,964
请他看这个暗藏的机关,把它引到通道里,再打死他
show him the hidden bolt, tempt him inside, then shoot him,

1233
01:15:26,964 --> 01:15:31,160
把枪扔在他身边,我们发现的时候就像是凶手扔在那的
and toss the gun to be found later as if abandoned by the killer.

1234
01:15:32,551 --> 01:15:35,737
可惜伯爵没有马上死掉
Sadly for the Count, he didn't die straightaway.

1235
01:15:35,737 --> 01:15:38,767
这是凶手唯一的失误,如果他不是有意这么做的话
The murderer's only mistake, if mistake it was.

1236
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:39,826
我的天!
Good God!

1237
01:15:39,944 --> 01:15:44,545
可怜的人,过了一会,当凯德先生发现他的时候他还活着呢
The poor man was still living when Mr Cade found him some time later.

1238
01:15:46,513 --> 01:15:47,898
继续说啊,简
Go on, Jane.

1239
01:15:48,864 --> 01:15:50,535
那些信件...
Those letters...

1240
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:54,378
我真是很傻很天真
I've been woefully, unforgivably naive.

1241
01:15:54,934 --> 01:15:57,777
康斯坦斯和上尉,啊,多么浪漫啊
Constance and the Captain, ah, the romance of it.

1242
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,643
让人看不出问题来了...
One gets swept along and yet...

1243
01:16:01,344 --> 01:16:03,029
我这么问吧
Let me pose a question.

1244
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:07,467
一对情人,决心要隐瞒他们的罗曼史
A pair of lovers, determined to hide their secret,

1245
01:16:07,467 --> 01:16:10,003
他们当然要用假名通信了
might they not write under an alias?

1246
01:16:10,003 --> 01:16:12,396
所以路德维格伯爵自称上尉
Indeed, Count Ludwig called himself the Captain.

1247
01:16:12,396 --> 01:16:16,437
他是这样的,那么为什么只有伯爵用了假名呢?
So he did. But why just the Count and not Constance?

1248
01:16:16,437 --> 01:16:19,137
她不是和他一样害怕秘密被人发现吗?
Did she not fear exposure as much as him?

1249
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:25,062
除非康斯坦斯也是个假名
Unless Constance was also an alias.

1250
01:16:25,259 --> 01:16:30,642
那么说信里的康斯坦斯不是柴德维尔了?
So the Constance of the letters was not Treadwell?

1251
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,472
抱歉,班铎
Forgive me, Bundle.

1252
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:38,118
我从你的剪贴簿里拿到了这个
I took this from your scrapbook.

1253
01:16:39,271 --> 01:16:41,142
一条狗,怎么了?
It's a dog. So what?

1254
01:16:41,142 --> 01:16:44,160
是妈妈养的第一条狗狗
Well, it's Mama's first mutt.

1255
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:47,054
上尉,名字叫上尉
Captain. It was called Captain.

1256
01:16:47,054 --> 01:16:50,162
它特别喜欢柴德维尔,妈妈开他们的玩笑说...
It was so besotted with Treadwell Mama used to joke they were like...

1257
01:16:50,162 --> 01:16:51,283
他们是"完美的情人"
"Perfect lovers."

1258
01:16:54,433 --> 01:16:57,102
我们的妈妈想到的这些假名
Our mother must have thought of these aliases.

1259
01:16:57,102 --> 01:16:59,967
康斯坦斯和上尉,是我们的妈妈?
Constance and her Captain. Our mother?

1260
01:16:59,967 --> 01:17:01,972
她用"康斯坦斯"做假名
Took the alias "Constance".

1261
01:17:02,558 --> 01:17:05,417
你妈妈就是伯爵的秘密情人
Your mother was the Count's secret lover.

1262
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:13,427
我不明白
I don't understand.

1263
01:17:13,427 --> 01:17:18,198
你是在说是伯爵和玛德琳偷了钻石吗?
Are you saying that the Count and Madeleine stole the diamond?

1264
01:17:18,198 --> 01:17:20,520
哦,那该死的钻石
Oh, that wretched diamond.

1265
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,204
我们都太着迷于迈索尔钻石了
We're all so bewitched by the Mysore Diamond, 

1266
01:17:23,204 --> 01:17:26,429
我们提出自己的假设却忘记了事实
we forge our theories and forget the facts.

1267
01:17:26,429 --> 01:17:29,156
要看清事实的真相
It is so important to see things clearly,

1268
01:17:29,156 --> 01:17:32,343
像是透过一面玻璃而不是棱镜
as if through a pane of glass, and not a prism.

1269
01:17:32,343 --> 01:17:33,277
不好意思
Excuse me.

1270
01:17:36,094 --> 01:17:36,704
抱歉
Sorry.

1271
01:17:43,347 --> 01:17:44,514
我的天
Good God.

1272
01:17:54,463 --> 01:17:55,175
可以给我吗?
May I?

1273
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:59,181
我想伯爵是不可能杀了艾格尼丝
I'm afraid there's no way the Count murdered Agnes 

1274
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:01,044
然后带着钻石跑路的
and made off with the diamond.

1275
01:18:01,418 --> 01:18:04,451
因为钻石一直跟艾格尼丝在一起呢
Because the diamond has been with Agnes all the time.

1276
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:08,692
就在坟墓里,是凶手留在那里的
In the tomb, just where the killer left it.

1277
01:18:11,246 --> 01:18:13,912
当我们找到可怜的艾格尼丝的遗骸的时候,记得吗?
When we found poor Agnes's bones, do you remember?

1278
01:18:16,449 --> 01:18:18,804
我们之中隐藏了一位演员
Your histrionics in the crypt.

1279
01:18:18,804 --> 01:18:20,326
是你拿走的,是不是?
You took it then, didn't you?

1280
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,917
然后把它丢进池塘里
And dropped it in the fountain.

1281
01:18:24,518 --> 01:18:27,295
要不然你干嘛擦手呢?
Why else would you be drying your hands?

1282
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:38,687
爸爸?
Daddy?

1283
01:18:40,003 --> 01:18:40,967
为什么?
Why?

1284
01:18:43,537 --> 01:18:46,344
32年宴会那晚
The night of the party, '32.

1285
01:18:47,287 --> 01:18:50,458
我弄丢了一个袖扣,你信吗
I'd lost a cufflink, if you can believe it.

1286
01:18:50,978 --> 01:18:53,665
我上楼去...
I went upstairs and then...

1287
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:04,880
不,不.您不能往那边去,求您
No, no, no, no, you mustn't go in there, please.

1288
01:19:05,379 --> 01:19:07,372
求您听我的
Please, sir, listen to what I'm saying.

1289
01:19:08,873 --> 01:19:10,879
我不是有意杀她的
I'd not meant to kill her,

1290
01:19:11,201 --> 01:19:13,023
但她想要阻止我
but she tried to prevent me 

1291
01:19:13,023 --> 01:19:17,620
不想我看到我妻子和那个小提琴手在一起
from seeing my wife and the fiddle player.

1292
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,804
然后我的大脑清晰了起来
And then my mind cleared.

1293
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:25,310
我拿走了钻石
I took the diamond.

1294
01:19:26,265 --> 01:19:28,920
把它留在艾格尼丝身边
Left it with Agnes.

1295
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:32,669
他们自然会以为是她拿着钻石跑掉了
Naturally it was assumed that she had run off with it.

1296
01:19:34,472 --> 01:19:39,654
那后就是跟我妻子撒一个善意的谎言
Then all that remained was to tell my wife a white lie.

1297
01:19:39,654 --> 01:19:42,186
告诉她有人看到艾格尼丝
You told her Agnes had been seen.

1298
01:19:42,186 --> 01:19:45,467
和维也纳的小提琴手在一起
Cavorting with the Viennese fiddler

1299
01:19:46,769 --> 01:19:50,137
而他还继续给她写信
who, of course, went on writing to her for quite some time,

1300
01:19:50,137 --> 01:19:51,959
但是我把那些信收起来了
but I took care of those letters.

1301
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:53,918
那些信只会让她痛苦的
They would only have caused her pain.

1302
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:58,167
知道吗,现在想想,真是好笑
You know, it's funny, looking back.

1303
01:19:59,212 --> 01:20:02,282
她那么容易就相信了
She was so easily deceived.

1304
01:20:03,478 --> 01:20:07,685
这些浪漫的东西是多么易碎
These romances are so fragile.

1305
01:20:08,573 --> 01:20:11,337
根本就没有真正的忠诚
There's no real devotion at all.

1306
01:20:11,746 --> 01:20:15,009
不像我们之间的感情那样
Not such as we all had,

1307
01:20:15,009 --> 01:20:21,532
在一起,作为一家人,在烟囱大厦
together, as a family, here at Chimneys.

1308
01:20:21,532 --> 01:20:23,194
她并不快乐
She was unhappy.

1309
01:20:23,897 --> 01:20:26,652
她被困在这里,怪不得会憋出病来
Trapped. No wonder she got ill.

1310
01:20:26,652 --> 01:20:30,394
但是她死后,你找到了那些以前的信件
But after she died, you found the earlier letters,

1311
01:20:30,394 --> 01:20:31,987
是不是,上尉写给她的那些
didn't you, from the Captain?

1312
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,450
这么多年,她一直好好保管着
She'd kept them safe, all these years.

1313
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:36,799
是啊
Yes, indeed.

1314
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:39,400
每一句
Every word.

1315
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:44,022
所以当洛马克斯先生给你看路德维格伯爵说
So that when Mr Lomax showed you the letter from Count Ludwig,

1316
01:20:44,022 --> 01:20:45,695
想要来访烟囱大厦的信的时候
suggesting a visit to Chimneys

1317
01:20:45,695 --> 01:20:47,669
你立刻认出了他的笔迹
you knew the handwriting at once.

1318
01:20:47,669 --> 01:20:51,424
跟那些信件上的字一模一样,你知道...
A precise match for the old love letters. And you knew...

1319
01:20:51,424 --> 01:20:55,890
上尉就要来了
The Captain was on his way.

1320
01:20:56,818 --> 01:20:58,491
但是整爆竹干嘛?
But why the firework?

1321
01:20:59,212 --> 01:21:01,526
干嘛非得11点45?
Why 11:45?

1322
01:21:01,844 --> 01:21:07,311
埃弗斯利先生,你写给凯德先生的那封信,是不是没封口?
Mr Eversleigh, is it possible that the letter you wrote to Mr Cade 

1323
01:21:07,311 --> 01:21:09,452
埃弗斯利先生,你写给凯德先生的那封信,是不是没封口?
was in fact left unsealed?

1324
01:21:10,738 --> 01:21:12,101
你的客人到了,先生
Your guest has arrived, sir.

1325
01:21:12,518 --> 01:21:14,112
还留在桌上?
Still on the desk?

1326
01:21:14,112 --> 01:21:16,421
爵爷桌上的信,请您用快递寄出去
Letters for posting on his Lordship's desk.

1327
01:21:20,812 --> 01:21:23,879
你只需要加上时间
All that remained was to add the time.

1328
01:21:28,293 --> 01:21:31,870
你自己给凯德写了并寄了那封信
You wrote and posted the letter to Cade yourself.

1329
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:36,007
然后又设计枪响在11点45分,就是要陷害凯德
And staged the gunshot for 11:45 to incriminate Cade.

1330
01:21:36,574 --> 01:21:38,897
要除掉你的敌人最好的办法是什么?
What better way to be rid of your enemies?

1331
01:21:38,897 --> 01:21:41,343
杀一个嫁祸另一个
Frame one for the killing of the other.

1332
01:21:41,343 --> 01:21:45,441
凯德不是什么好人,你自己也承认了
Cade is no good. You said as much yourself.

1333
01:21:45,771 --> 01:21:48,929
至于他打算把你拐到非洲去...
And as for this plan to ship you off to Africa...

1334
01:21:48,929 --> 01:21:50,978
别这么看着我
Now, don't look at me like that. 

1335
01:21:50,978 --> 01:21:54,344
婚姻不能建立在谎言之上
You cannot build a marriage on lies.

1336
01:21:54,344 --> 01:21:56,451
不是应该建立在爱情之上吗?
Aren't you supposed to build it on love?

1337
01:21:57,904 --> 01:21:58,883
柴德维尔呢?
And Treadwell?

1338
01:21:59,656 --> 01:22:00,843
跟我们想的一样
As we thought.

1339
01:22:01,486 --> 01:22:07,981
不是毛地黄毒死的...而是你的补药
Poisoned not by the foxglove leaves...but by your tonic.

1340
01:22:09,292 --> 01:22:12,575
有效成分是洋地黄,过量摄入致死
Active ingredient: digitalis. A huge overdose.

1341
01:22:14,155 --> 01:22:16,233
我确实很后悔杀她
Now, I do regret that.

1342
01:22:16,233 --> 01:22:18,452
她是个忠诚的仆人
She was a faithful servant.

1343
01:22:18,452 --> 01:22:20,583
比你认为的更忠诚
More faithful than you knew.

1344
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:24,051
你害怕她会把那段情事告诉探长
You were so fearful that she would tell the Inspector 

1345
01:22:24,051 --> 01:22:25,308
你害怕她会把那段情事告诉探长
about the affair. On the contrary.

1346
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:26,463
恰恰相反
about the affair. On the contrary.

1347
01:22:26,463 --> 01:22:30,112
她却想尽办法保护她女主人的秘密
She was taking measures to protect her mistress's secret.

1348
01:22:30,503 --> 01:22:32,883
艾格尼丝的遗骸一被发现
As soon as Agnes's bones were recovered,

1349
01:22:32,883 --> 01:22:37,289
她就从你那里找到了信件放到自己屋里
she took the letters from amongst your possessions to her own room.

1350
01:22:38,035 --> 01:22:44,251
要是我不杀她,就不会有人知道了
If I'd let her live, no-one would have found out.

1351
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:46,121
你是这个意思吗?
Is that what you mean?

1352
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,759
好吧,那就是这样了
Well, that's it, then.

1353
01:22:51,986 --> 01:22:53,442
还有
Not quite.

1354
01:22:54,194 --> 01:22:54,940
爸爸?
Daddy?

1355
01:22:57,884 --> 01:23:00,527
"有一天会回来取回最珍贵的珠宝"
"Return one day for the greatest jewel."

1356
01:23:01,141 --> 01:23:02,672
别说了
You stop.

1357
01:23:02,672 --> 01:23:07,421
如果这珠宝是指的别的什么呢?
What if this jewel was a diamond of a different kind?

1358
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:10,597
别说了!   不管是什么我们有权知道
Stop!   Whatever it is, we have a right to know.

1359
01:23:15,153 --> 01:23:16,495
玫瑰
A rose.

1360
01:23:16,495 --> 01:23:18,767
不是随便什么玫瑰
Not just any rose.

1361
01:23:20,033 --> 01:23:21,690
是里士满玫瑰
The Richmond rose.

1362
01:23:25,218 --> 01:23:27,453
"里士满二十,向北,三,向东"
"Richmond Twenty, North Three East."

1363
01:23:27,453 --> 01:23:29,789
里士满指的不是画像
The Richmond referred to is not the portrait.

1364
01:23:29,789 --> 01:23:33,172
没错,而是里士满玫瑰
Precisely. The rose of Richmond.

1365
01:23:33,172 --> 01:23:34,731
啊
Ah.

1366
01:23:36,157 --> 01:23:39,222
那么这些方向,是指向哪里的?
Well, these directions, where did they lead?

1367
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:43,477
1,2...
One, two...

1368
01:23:58,723 --> 01:24:00,129
我不明白
I don't understand.

1369
01:24:00,887 --> 01:24:02,003
简?
Jane?

1370
01:24:02,549 --> 01:24:05,629
记得伯爵的遗言吗?
The Count's last words. Do you remember?

1371
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:07,427
墙,墙
Der Wand. The wall.

1372
01:24:07,427 --> 01:24:10,446
我们以为他指的是通道里的墙
We thought he meant the wall in the passageway.

1373
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:14,909
但是这美国藤,什么时候栽种的?
But this Virginia creeper, when was it planted?

1374
01:24:15,502 --> 01:24:22,074
玛德琳23年前栽下的,庆祝你的出生
Madeleine planted it 23 years ago to celebrate your birth.

1375
01:24:22,074 --> 01:24:24,011
美国藤(弗吉尼亚藤)
Virginia creeper.

1376
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:29,432
我想他临死的时候一定想明白了
He knew, I'm sure he did, as he lay dying.

1377
01:24:29,754 --> 01:24:32,801
玫瑰,舞蹈...
The rose, the dance...

1378
01:24:33,693 --> 01:24:35,711
都变得明朗起来
..it all made sense.

1379
01:24:37,082 --> 01:24:40,248
我想那封密信是你妈妈临死的时候写给伯爵的
I think your mother wrote to the Count, 

1380
01:24:40,248 --> 01:24:42,183
我想那封密信是你妈妈临死的时候写给伯爵的
shortly before she passed away.

1381
01:24:43,423 --> 01:24:44,804
那封密信
The coded letter?

1382
01:24:47,217 --> 01:24:50,472
她不想让秘密跟她一起埋入地下
She didn't want the truth to die with her, not quite.

1383
01:24:52,036 --> 01:24:55,314
你的意思是...   你就是"最珍贵的珠宝"
So, you mean...   You were the "greatest jewel".

1384
01:24:55,621 --> 01:24:57,723
他来带你走的
He'd come to take you away.

1385
01:24:58,029 --> 01:25:00,129
我的小姑娘
My own little girl.

1386
01:25:07,597 --> 01:25:09,590
我的女儿
My darling girl.

1387
01:25:12,536 --> 01:25:14,639
他是我生父?
He was my father?

1388
01:25:19,923 --> 01:25:22,581
不,不
No. No.

1389
01:25:48,047 --> 01:25:50,996
如果你现在想放手...   我不会的
I feel, if you were to let go now...   I won't.

1390
01:25:51,301 --> 01:25:55,861
我就会离开...   我不会的
I'd just float off and...   I won't.

1391
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:03,021
来吧,该来的躲不掉
Come on. No use putting off the inevitable.

1392
01:26:03,021 --> 01:26:05,179
你来说还是我来说?
Are you going to tell her or shall I?

1393
01:26:05,179 --> 01:26:09,148
我想我来说比较好
Oh, I think it's best coming from me.

1394
01:26:12,469 --> 01:26:13,673
贝金索普!
Blenkinsopp!

1395
01:26:22,108 --> 01:26:23,143
哦,天啊
Oh, dear.

1396
01:26:23,371 --> 01:26:25,981
哦,天啊.班铎肯定不喜欢这样
Oh, dear. Bundle won't like that at all.

1397
01:26:27,111 --> 01:26:30,084
但是你们不是要把烟囱大厦卖掉吧?
But you're not selling Chimneys?

1398
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:34,124
班铎不想在这里呆着了,我也不想
Well, Bundle couldn't bear to stay on, and I don't want to live here,

1399
01:26:34,124 --> 01:26:35,438
你觉得呢?
so what do you think?

1400
01:26:35,438 --> 01:26:37,220
把麻烦都丢给贝金索普
Pass the whole headache on to Blenkinsopp 

1401
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:39,808
让她去打理吧.干嘛不呢?
and her tea and scones. Why not?

1402
01:26:40,031 --> 01:26:42,640
她不会有事吧,我是说班铎?
Will she be all right? Bundle, I mean.

1403
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:45,661
她会把精力放在别的什么地方
Oh, she'll foist herself onto some undeserving cause.

1404
01:26:45,661 --> 01:26:47,697
她爸爸?   大概吧
Her father?    I suppose.

1405
01:26:47,697 --> 01:26:48,673
那你呢?
And you?

1406
01:26:51,067 --> 01:26:52,509
他们来了
Here they come.

1407
01:26:54,644 --> 01:26:56,060
幸福的婚姻
A happy marriage.

1408
01:26:56,734 --> 01:26:58,385
也不会很难吧,是不是?
It can't be that difficult, can it?

1409
01:26:58,385 --> 01:27:00,152
跟随自己的心愿
Go with your heart.

1410
01:27:00,152 --> 01:27:01,261
像妈妈那样?
Like mother?

1411
01:27:01,932 --> 01:27:05,129
我一直在想,她要是真那么爱伯爵
I keep thinking, if she loved her Count so much,

1412
01:27:05,129 --> 01:27:07,552
为什么她又那么轻易的就相信他会跑掉呢?
why was she so quick to believe he'd run off?

1413
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:11,491
我想爱真的需要勇气吧
I suppose love is an act of courage.

1414
01:27:16,865 --> 01:27:18,124
是的
Yes.

1415
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,915
马普尔小姐   再见了,探长
Miss Marple.   Goodbye, Inspector.

1416
01:27:27,915 --> 01:27:31,842
谢谢你,现在我知道我太在意自己的名声了
Thank you. I see now I've grown too fond of my own reputation.

1417
01:27:32,905 --> 01:27:36,512
我那么想找到那该死的钻石
I was so bewitched by the blasted diamond.

1418
01:27:36,837 --> 01:27:39,831
现在看看我,成了你又一个手下败将
And now look at me. The latest of your casualties.

1419
01:27:42,037 --> 01:27:44,048
你看怎么样?   哦
What do you think?   Oh.

1420
01:27:44,697 --> 01:27:47,331
国际刑警组织想让我带着它去南非
Interpol want me to take it to South Africa,

1421
01:27:47,331 --> 01:27:49,467
给比勒陀利亚的那个家伙下个套
entrap this villainous fellow from Pretoria.

1422
01:27:49,467 --> 01:27:52,583
你知道探长,我真是不在乎这个钻石
You know, Inspector, I don't care for it at all.

1423
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:56,770
再见
Goodbye.
