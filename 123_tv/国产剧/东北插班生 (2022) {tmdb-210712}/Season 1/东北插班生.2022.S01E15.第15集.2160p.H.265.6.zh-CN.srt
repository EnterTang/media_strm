1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,110
When they write the book of my life,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,610
what section will I be in?

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,260
Mystery? Horror? Romance?

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,440
Or just misfiled and jammed  in the back under "military history"?

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,050
No,I can't--I can't do it like this. I can't.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:15,900
Sure you can.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,440
Just hold onto the civil war

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,800
and put your feet on the korean conflict.

9
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,840
What? No,no.

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,480
You have to break up with chloe.

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,300
All right? 
You said you were going to and now here we are.

12
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,480
We're sneaking around again--

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,770
and thank you for helping me 
find this book on tanks,sir.

14
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,460
No,"tank" you.

15
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,790
I'm serious,all right?

16
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,990
No more fooling around until you tell her.

17
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,810
I will. I'll do it today.

18
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,590
I promise.

19
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,310
Okay.

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,220
Look,I wanna be with you on your birthday.

21
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,530
I wanna start clean with you.

22
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,110
I wanna be part of your life again.

23
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,220
It's my birthday?

24

27
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,520
So anyway,my mom is going to throw me a birthday party,

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,020
and I'm gonna have cake and ice cream

29
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,310
and hats and no kazoos.

30
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,340
I don't like kazoos.

31
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,410
They sound like bees.

32
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,290
And I want you to be  
in charge of the guest list,okay?

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,350
Me?

34
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,330
Yay!

35
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,730
Okay,I'm gonna invite your mom and your dad

36
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,070
and andrea and me

37
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,990
and,uh... um...

38
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,150
okay,that's it!

39
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,670
Oh,wow.

40
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,050
What do you want for a gift?

41
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,560
I don't know.

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,750
I feel like I have everything I want,
you know?

43
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,620
I have this new chance at my life.

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,920
I've got great friends and family,

45
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,560
and when todd breaks up with chloe a new boyfriend.

46
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,540
Really? Is he gonna break up with her  
to be with you?

47
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,090
Uh-huh. Yeah,that

48
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,350
and because she's a total loon and emotional

49
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,690
and a little unstable.

50
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,820
You know what?

51
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,380
Just switch with me.

52
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,170
I don't want my back to the door.

53
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,730
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

54
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,120
move.

55
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,660
I want the sun behind me today.

56
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,950
it'll look good in my hair.

57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,190
what are you doing?

58
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,680
My mom's throwing me a birthday party,

59
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,270
so we're just figuring out who's coming.

60
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,040
No one's coming.

61
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,500
We don't do birthdays.

62
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,690
We go to the spa,

63
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,740
we fast all day,

64
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,040
and we wrap ourselves in seaweed

65
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,170
and we sweat out our toxins.

66
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,930
I want a piata!

67
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,230
Oh! ooh! Yeah.

68
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,720
Oh,my god. It's chloe and todd.

69
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,660
Duck,duck! Duck! Duck! Duck!

70
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,070
-get down! Get down! Andrea! 
-Get down. Shh!

71
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,870
-What are you doing? 
-Get down! Get down!

72
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,080
todd is breaking up with chloe today.

73
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,800
And I'd say she's taking it very well.

74
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,060
hey.

75
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,210
What are you doing here?

76
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,780
Nothing. Just came by  to see how the breakup went.

77
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,740
How'd chloe take it?

78
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,270
Pretty well.

79
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,930
Good,because I was afraid

80
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,110
she had trouble understanding you

81
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,860
with your tongue in her mouth.

82
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,000
You--you were at the aquarium?

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,550
What?! Todd!

84
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,020
You know,I would not have been 
fooling around with you

85
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,780
if you weren't gonna be 
breaking up with her already.

86
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,310
This was supposed to be just a little overlap,

87
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,170
but now the longer that you keep your girlfriend,

88
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,500
the longer I am just a boyfriend-stealing whore.

89
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,380
You're making me into a whore,todd.

90
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,930
I was gonna tell her,but her aunt is sick.

91
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,260
Her aunt is sick?

92
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,980
Yeah,she just found out her aunt wendy,

93
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,320
who practically raised her,

94
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,480
was admitted to st. Sofia's hospital.

95
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,770
But you know what?

96
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,940
If you break up with her now,

97
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,220
she could just meet somebody there.

98
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,430
I mean,a hospital's kind of like a nightclub.

99
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,030
You know,they got cute people and skimpy outfits

100
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,150
and--and drugs.

101
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,970
That's not really what she's thinking about.

102
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,860
Yeah,well,maybe it's because she doesn't know

103
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,030
that you promised to spend my birthdawith me.

104
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,610
Now you're putting chloe's feelings before mine

105
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,700
because she is feeling vulnerable but you know what?

106
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,140
You don't think that I'm feeling vulnerable?

107
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,640
I am turning 1!

108
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,220
oh,andrea.

109
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,490
Honey,do we need any drinking done?!

110
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,220
Sorry,dear. Check back next week.

111
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,010
Always funny. Yeah!

112
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,910
okay,I'm gonna make this quick,

113
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,680
then you can get back to your nap.

114
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,000
Samantha is not having her birthday party here.

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,680
No one is driving a half an hour

116
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,180
to the sticks to play twister

117
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,710
and watch a slide show of your trip to akron.

118
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
That was a gre party.

119
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,710
Samantha's birthday party

120
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,590
will be at my place on saturday.

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,520
You can come or not.

122
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,320
I'd love to,

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
but I'm having samantha's  
birthday party that night.

124
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,560
It's too bad that you cat make it.

125
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,300
Okay,okay,that's enough.

126
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,640
Regina,I hate taking sides against you,

127
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,350
and I know I'll pay for this for years to come,

128
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,090
but,you know,maybe sam  
would prefer a party in the city

129
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,730
you know,something hip,

130
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,660
you know,for the kids.

131
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,820
Are you telling me

132
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,580
that you didn't like your last birthday party?

133
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,770
People loved making their own place mats.

134
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,810
It was great.

135
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,120
But I'm talking about a real city party,

136
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
you know,like you see in the magazines

137
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,920
where--where celebrities show up,

138
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,120
like espn sideline reporter suzy kolber.

139
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,690
come on.

140
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,000
We'll make a night of it.

141
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,370
Well,okay. But i do the food.

142
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,370
That part's always a hit.

143
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,790
I mean,who doesn't love ambrosia salad?

144
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,810
So no todd on my birthday

145
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,420
because of some sick aunt.

146
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,170
We should get a todd piata.

147
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,580
A todd-yata.

148
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,920
So I've called 21 people,

149
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,520
and they all have jury duty.

150
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,460
On a saturday night?

151
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,560
There must be some really big trial or something.

152
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,880
No,there's no trial.

153
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,260
These people are just making up

154
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,370
lies to get out of something

155
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,210
that they don't wanna do.

156
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,610
oh,my god.

157
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,560
I do not want to go over to his place.

158
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,170
He's gonna break up with me.

159
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,680
I could tell it.

160
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,810
-I could tell it in his voice. 
-Then don't--don't let him.

161
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,100
He has no right to break up with you,

162
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,240
not when your favorite cousin is

163
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,620
in the hospital on his deathbed.

164
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,600
I don't have a cousin in the hospital.

165
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,810
You bet your ass you do.

166
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,650
Oh!

167
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,690
Yes. Cousin what's-his-name.

168
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,510
Yeah.

169
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,400
So you go to the hospital,

170
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,690
you find the name of someone 
who's actually there,

171
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,200
just in case he sends flowers or something.

172
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,930
Then if he gets suspicious and he goes there,

173
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,230
just put a picture of yourself next to  
the sick guy's bed.

174
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,570
It's airtight. Bam.

175
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,720
You just bought yourself a boyfriend  
through valentine's day.

176
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,380
Oh! Can I train with you,master?

177
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,120
The way of the samurai is a lonely path,darling.

178
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,090
Here you go,ladies. Oh!

179
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,390
From these gentlemen right over there.

180
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,810
But maybe not so lonely tonight.

181
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,510
sick aunt.

182
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,050
Chloe is lying.

183
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,490
once I prove that,

184
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,540
todd will have no problem breaking up with her,

185
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,810
and he will be mine...

186
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,680
and in time for my birthday.

187
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,180
So todd is coming?

188
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,760
Yeah.

189
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,990
Okay,'cause this thing is really  
starting to fill up.

190
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,760
Oh.

191
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,690
Mm. Hey.

192
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,420
Gotta stretch it out,you know?

193
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,130
-help you? 
-Oh! Hey there. Um... nurse.

194
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,820
Hi. Yeah,
I'm just looking for my,um,aunt wendy.

195
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,080
Last name?

196
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,240
It's just wendy.

197
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,840
Always been wendy to me.

198
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,860
aunt wendy. She's sick.

199
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,940
Don't have a wendy here.

200
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,440
Thank you very much.

201
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,440
She's lying.

202
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,360
Ha! I win.

203
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,790
I got a gwendolyn.

204
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,770

205
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,430

209
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,660
Sorry.

210
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,880
Did you need more time?

211
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,110
No. No.

212
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,810
oh,god!

213
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,000
yes. Okay.

214
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,360
Sam?

215
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,850
please take this woman safely into the...

216
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:04,540
bosom and grace of your all-knowing arms. Amen.

217
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,320
hi,chloe.

218
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,370
I was just...

219
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,330
helping this poor woman off to her reward.

220
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,510
What are you doing here?

221
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,170
Oh,chloe. Look,I-I know that

222
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,260
we've had our differences,

223
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,390
but,you know,when i found out about your aunt,

224
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,650
I just-- 
I just wanted to put all those things aside

225
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,500
and just--  
and just be with you.

226
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,790
Hi,auntie wendy.

227
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,240
And there she is--

228
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,530
your aunt. Ha!

229
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,640
Well.... congratulations.

230
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,420
No,um,not congratulations.

231
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,110
I'm sorry.

232
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,250
Uh,condolences.

233
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,150
No,that's--no,

234
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,780
'cause that's not right,'cause she's not...

235
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,960
she's not dead.

236
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,680
Congratulations!

237
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,760
Well,I'm off.

238
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,720
Hey,frank.

239
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,260
I was thinking how it must be gratifying,

240
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,250
doing your job,

241
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,450
being such an important part of  all these people's lives,

242
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,210
you know,

243
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,800
comin' and goin' here.

244
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,350
there's talk of replacing me  with a motion-sensing mat.

245
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,360
You like birthday cake?

246
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,110
Hey,todd,listen

247
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,340
um,I've done a 180 on this whole you breaking up

248
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,510
with chloe dealio.

249
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,800
I-I don't think you should break up with her yet.

250
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,420
I-I--

251
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,320
you know,I was thinking about her aunt,

252
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,220
and you're right.

253
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,010
You know,she's really,really sick,

254
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,130
so why don't you just call me back

255
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,310
after you do not break up with her? 
Do not. Okay.

256
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,940
Uh,bye. Hi.

257
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,610
So... I go to get my suit out of the cleaners  
for your birthday party,

258
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,410
and the guys there can't stop laughing.

259
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,750
They say they're waiting to see

260
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,510
who picks up this suit so they can see

261
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,230
what his time machine looks like.

262
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,870
Well,I'm sorry I don't dress like the internet.

263
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,510
I know. It's strange that I just showed up here,

264
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,190
but...

265
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,890
I found yourress

266
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,670
when I was going through  todd's computer last week,

267
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,010
and I need to talk to you.

268
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:07,880
Yeah.

269
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,790
Todd...

270
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,590
-broke up with me.  
-Oh?

271
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,890
-Yeah.  
-Okay.

272
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,890
-I really...  
-what?

273
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,650
Need a friend right now.

274
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,550
All right. There,there.

275
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,180
There. You know what?

276
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,410
your hands are a little close to my neck.

277
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,590
just don'T...

278
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,320
yeah,all right.

279
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,380
Okay,that's better.

280
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,460
There,there. There,here.

281
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,990
dad?

282
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,070
so you really think That I'm the one  
that you wanna talk to?

283
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,410
Well,yeah.

284
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,660
Why not?

285
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,420
I know you were with todd.

286
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,800
You do? No,I wasn'T.

287
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:42,890
When?

288
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,240
For three... years.

289
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,520
Oh,this amnesia thing is

290
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
really tiring. I'm sorry.

291
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,840
Oh,yeah. No. I know.

292
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,090
When you showed up to the hpital to support me,

293
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,500
that was the nicest thing  anyone's ever done for me.

294
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,930
I think maybe I misjudged you.

295
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,910
Yeah,well,it happens.

296
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,230
But you know what?

297
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,260
You seem okay.

298
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,240
I-I mean,it's probably good

299
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,350
to just get all this

300
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,370
just bad news out of the way.

301
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,670
In fact,I'm sure that you're probably  
more upset about your aunt

302
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,010
than you are about todd,huh?

303
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,440
No,I'm more upset about todd.

304
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,210
Are you sure?

305
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,740
'Cause you know what? I saw your aunt,

306
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,760
she wasn't looking so great.

307
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,200
Sammy?

308
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,220
Hi. I can't go to this thing

309
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,700

310
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,250

312
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,500
so just so you know.

313
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,320
oh,my god! Look at this.

314
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,030
Oh,don't ha a fit.

315
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,130
I'll clean it up.

316
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,540
No,it's not that.

317
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,330
I just have never been in here.

318
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,810
I wasn't even sure if

319
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,610
the appliances were real. Hmm.

320
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,070
Oh,come on.

321
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,050
You must have cooked breakfast

322
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,260
for hundreds of young men.

323
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,980
I can cook,you know.

324
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,240
I just usually go out.

325
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,940
That must be nice--

326
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,010
clubs,restaurants.

327
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,780
Yeah.

328
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,160
Sometimes it's nice to stay in.

329
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,660
I bet yotravel a lot,too,don't you?

330
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,770
Yeah,on business.

331
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,110
Where's the--

332
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,250
where's the farthest you've ever been?

333
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,880
I don't know. Marrakech?

334
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,030
Marrakech.

335
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,950
Oh,my god. How exotic.

336
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,430
Howard and I haven't been anywhere  
but pensacola for years.

337
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,900
He won't fly.

338
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,730
He hates to take his shoes off in front of people.

339
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,680
But I'm hopeful.

340
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,640
I keep bing travel magazines.

341
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,290
Okay,do not tell anyone this,

342
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,160
but once a year I buy "good housekeeping"--

343
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,220
the issue with...

344
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,010
100 holiday ideas.

345
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,720
Me,too!

346
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,920
you know,andrea, 
you could make this kitchen fun to use.

347
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,390
You could have everything out in the open.

348
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,210
You could hang a pot rack here over the stove.

349
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,270
Oh,like I can hang a pot rack.

350
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,630
Well,yeah,
my husband does those things for me.

351
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,300
See,I need that.

352
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,900
A man with tools--

353
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,830
it's very hot.

354
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,630
I can use a man like that.

355
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,140
Howard has shingles.

356
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,180
So anyway,todd and i were just about to record

357
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,960
a new outgoing message--"hi.

358
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,070
It's the home of todd and chloe.

359
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,840
Leave a message,

360
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,350
whether friend or foe-Y."

361
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,360
Anyway,so he was supposed to do 
"friend or foe-y,"

362
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,820
and all of a sudden,e said,

363
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,400
"this isn't working out."

364
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,450
And I knew he meant us,

365
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,570
because I've had that message for years.

366
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,540
People love it.

367
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,000
Mm. And... ahem.

368
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,300
He gave no reason at all?

369
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,220
Nope. But I know he's seeing someone.

370
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,370
You do? How can you?

371
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,210
No,you can'T.

372
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,370
Because he's todd.

373
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,440
That's what he does.

374
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,520
What's what he does?

375
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,900
Not leave someone until he has someone else.

376
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,270
You know,ke how he was with you before he left

377
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,500
his previous girlfriend,

378
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,070
and he and I were making out

379
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,580
for a full two weeks

380
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,440
before he finally

381
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,450
broke it off with you.

382
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,260
Hmm.

383
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,690
So,howard,you enjoyingyour city party?

384
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,170
Even samantha didn't bother to come.

385
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,240
Oh,the place will fill up.

386
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,660
They're just fashionably late.

387
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,790
You know,some of these people,

388
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,180
these glitterati--

389
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,360
they don't roll in

390
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,430
until at least 8:30.

391
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,250
look at you. Very nice.

392
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,180
Yes,yes,he knows.

393
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,110
Moving along.

394
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,250
Ugh. Oh! Look at me.

395
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,740
My shoes are all wrong.

396
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,180
Thankfully,no one will see me

397
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,710
since you didn't get anyone here!

398
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,690
I did so!

399
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,850
This is not everyone.

400
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,130
Other people are coming!

401
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,340
see?

402
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,130
Ah!

403
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,650
Hello.

404
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,340
I wasn't going to come,

405
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,930
but my wife doesn't want me around

406
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,650
during our daughter's homework time.

407
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,280
She says I get impatient.

408
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,720
It's just decimals, for god sake.

409
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,540
You move it one place for every tenth.

410
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,460
How hard is that?

411
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,460
I'm going to want some wine.

412
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,680
Okay. Now...

413
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,810
everyone is here

414
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,870
why didn't you tell me?

415
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,840
I know 15 eurotrash partiers

416
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,770
who can be here in 5 minutes.

417
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,880
It's samantha's birthday party.

418
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,450
You can't fill it with strangers.

419
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,570
She has amnesia.

420
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,630
Start dialing.

421
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,220
-Hey. Happy birthday. 
-Hi

422
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,530
Thank you. Um...

423
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,220
before we go to the party,

424
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,970
I-I need to ask,uh,

425
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,570
something... quick.

426
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,110
Were you--

427
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,910
were you fooling around with chloe

428
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,360
before you broke up with me?

429
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,760
You look really pretty.

430
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,370
Were you ever gonna tell me about it?

431
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:18,990
I did...

432
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,400
before the accident.

433
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,870
Oh,god,don'T.

434
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,170
You can't pull it off.

435
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,180
Well,I'm sorry I'm not as good a liar as you.

436
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,830
I mean,you were able to sleep 
with the french guy without me knowing.

437
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,670
Oh,I can't believe that 
you're gonna bring up rene right now.

438
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,160
Really? You know,because I think 
it's a perfect time to bring him up.

439
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah,but you didn't know about 
that until after we broke up.

440
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,060
Well,you didn't know about chloe 
until after we broke up.

441
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,240
That is very different.

442
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,160
how?

443
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,270
Because I am not like that anymore.

444
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,650
That was bad sam,

445
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,250
and you're just,you know,

446
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,320
same todd.

447
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,980
I don't wanna live like that.

448
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,010
I have nothing to hide.

449
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:51,970
hide!

450
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,950
you know, to an outside observer,

451
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,840
this might not seem like  
a very healthy relationship.

452
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,080
you sure? Okay. Anybody?

453
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,080
oh! Oh,frank,

454
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,020
my hands are kinda full.

455
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,140
Could you get that,please?

456
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,190
Nope. I'm off the clock.

457
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,840
I don't open doors.

458
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,430
I won't call you a cab,

459
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,770
and I won't find you an escort service.

460
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,190
Good ambrosia,though.

461
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,510
Oh,thank you.

462
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,980
Would you have broken up 
with chloe if I hadn't pushed you?

463
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,760
what?

464
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,300
You wanna talk about this now?

465
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,030
You got somewhere to be?

466
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,040
Okay. Yes.

467
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,340
No,you would not.

468
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,280
Shh! How do you know

469
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,210
about chloe and me?

470
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,320
Because she told me.

471
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,130
Oh.

472
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,680
Because this is what you do,right?

473
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,720
Because you can't be alone.

474
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,080
You just-- 
you just swing from girl to girl like monkey bars.

475
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,380
Why is chloe talking to you, anyway?

476
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,590
Because that... you know...

477
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,200
it's not important.

478
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,370
Well,while you two were sharing,

479
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,780
did you tell her you and i have been making out?

480
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,850
No,todd.

481
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,480
I-I think that the girl has been through enough.
Don't you?

482
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,650
-Bad sam! 
-Stop that!

483
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,820
-she's coming! 
-What?

484
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,510
She's coming.

485
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,030
Move,move out of my way!

486
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,870
Get down!

487
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:15,890
Ohh!

488
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,950
Oh,god!

489
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,370
Oh,god,you scared me.

490
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,080
Oh,yeah,yeah, you scared me,too.

491
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,340
I thought you were--

492
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,560
I thought you were todd.

493
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,890
What are you doin'?

494
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,100
Oh,I was just gettiso me... 
shoes to wear

495
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,050
for my birthday party.

496
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,380
You didn't say you were having a party.

497
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,080
Oh,yeah. Well,it was a--

498
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,980
it's a surprise.

499
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,270
But... you already know.

500
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,360
Oh,shoot.

501
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,910
I ruined the surprise.

502
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,750
What?

503
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,610
I don't know. I can'T...

504
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,150
I can't do this. I can't do this.

505
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,560
I'm sorry,chloe.

506
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,840
Todd and I are together.

507
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,140
Oh,my god.

508
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,370
You're so pathetic.

509
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,630
I know you have amnesia and everything,

510
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,970
but you tried this already,remember?

511
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,910
Where's todd supposed to be this time?

512
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,180
Huh? Where is he?

513
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,320
Oh,in the bathroom?

514
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,780
No,you did that one.

515
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,020
oh, maybe he's in the closet,huh?

516
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,800
Maybe he's in here.

517
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,270
That would be devastating.

518
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,450
I thought you were my friend.

519
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,690
You came to the hospital and everything.

520
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,560
Oh,my god.

521
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,320
Uh,you two deserve each other.

522
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,100
Good luck.

523
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,600
the hospital?

524
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,080
It doesn't matter,okay?

525
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,930
She's right.

526
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,120
I mean,look at us.

527
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,480
Yeah,chloe's gone,

528
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,550
and I am sitting here,

529
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,590
but maybe I'm sitting here because I'm not her.

530
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,780
Or maybe I'm sitting here  
because you just can't be alone.

531
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,270
You know,w with you,

532
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,570
I don't know if I'm me or I'm just not her.

533
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,500
Well,are you saying  
you don't want us to be together?

534
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,620
No,I'm just saying that  
I am so tired of being not someone.

535
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,530
It's time for me to be someone.

536
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,170
Maybe if we were different people or...

537
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,720
and we had never met, 
then we could have a fresh start,

538
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,490
but we're not.

539
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,490
You still have stuff here, you know.

540
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,220
I'll always have stuff here,todd.

541
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,190
happy birthday...

542
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,420
so "the book of sam"

543
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,700
is ready for volume two--

544
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,480
a stack of blank pages and no better way

545
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,280
to begin than celebrating my 1st birthday
with my parents,my friends

546
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,390
and my remarkably attractive

547
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,280
and diverse seventh grade clas

548
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,880
make a wish and blow.

549
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,720
A good one,make a good one.

550
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,580
that was great.

551
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,360
I want that candle when you're done.

552
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,090
hey.

553
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,740
Hey.

554
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,860
What's going on?

555
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,780
Oh,I'm sorry. U.. hi.

556
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,520
My name's todd.

557
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,390
Um... samantha.

558
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,100
Yeah. I think I've seen you at the coffee place.

559
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,190
Yeah,I usually don't do this,

560
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,080
but,um,here's my number.

561
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,820
Call me... sometime if you wanna get together.

562
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,040
-Thanks. 
-Balloons.

563
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,180
yeah.

564
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,920
You--you got 21 people,

565
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,380
so you make 20 cuts.

566
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,850
It's not rocket science.

567
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,050
-You just-- 
-okay,just give me the knife.

568
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,630
-Give me the knife. Give me-- 
-I can do--

569
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,000
give it. Give it.

570
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,280
Thank you. Hold this.

571
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,740
-I get to cut the first piece,right? 
-Get cuttin'.

572
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,760
Square plates for a round cake.

573
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,400
-who wants cake? 
-This is amazing,mom.

574
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,200
-Thank you so much. 
-You're welcome, sweetheart.

575
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,930
Cheers.
