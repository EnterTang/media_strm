All these years thinking the ghost was talking to me.

I convinced myself it was Hari,

and I started to believe that I actually was special.

But if the visions weren't coming from him,

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,750

the children of the Outer Reach took Hari's words to heart,

It takes more power to build than to burn, and Hari wanted them to build.

Just a cry in the dark.

Are we alone?

521
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:27,420
��ʹ���� ���˻��Ӧ�� 
And even if we aren't, will anyone bother to answer?

Okay.

Go away.

Hey. Hey, can you hear me?

It's okay.

It's okay. You're okay. It's okay.

The readout said you'd been in cryo over a century.

I crash-landed.

I came looking for someone.

I'm your daughter.

I'm pretty sure this belongs to you.

Sometimes you leap.

And sometimes, someone catches you.
