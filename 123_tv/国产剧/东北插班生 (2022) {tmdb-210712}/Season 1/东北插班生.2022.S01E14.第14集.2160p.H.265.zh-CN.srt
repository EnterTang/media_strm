3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,000
you know how when a waiter tells you 

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,600
not to touch your plate because it's hot,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,200
you immediately have to touch it?

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,700
I mean,I guess there's a part of you

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,700
that wants to see how hot the plate really is.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,100
But maybe you touch it because inside,

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,700
you just wanna do something wrong. 

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,100
did you hear that?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What was it? The door?

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,800
No. My back cracked.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,900
oh, god. I love that.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,900
Oh, don't do that to me.

15
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,100
If chloe catches us...

16
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,200
oh, she's not gonna catch us.

17
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,700
I saw her get into a cab five minutes ago.

18
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,000
She didn't see you,did she?
No, no. I was hiding behind a newspaper,

19
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,900
which was very informative,by the way.

20
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,800
Did you know that we have never had a black president or a woman?

21
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,000
This country's wei. Mm. Mm.

22
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,100
your back.Not my back.

23
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,800
frank, it's you.

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,300
Pardon me. I thought you said you weren't going to be home

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,200
and that I should leave your "as seen on tv" package inside.

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,900
I changed my mind.A lot of work.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
All the ph-photography,you know?

28
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,400
I mean, enough with the weddings already.

29
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,500
Take the money and buy a house,people. 

30
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,900
where shall I put the package?

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Okay, look, frank,lately, things haven't been great with chloe and me.

32
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,600
Maybe she moved in too soon.

33
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,900
Maybe we're just different people.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,300
Relationships. Am I right?

35
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,700
By the table?
Perfect.

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,200
Don't judge me, anK.

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,200
Oh, that ship sailed a long time ago.

38
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,100
You ever thought about running for president?

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,800
In the couch? What were you hiding as, spare change?
Ha ha.

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,300
I panicked, all right?

41
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,600
Have you ever seen todd's back?

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,900
That chick has nails.

43
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,500
My heart is still beating like crazy. You gotta feel this.

44
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,800
Yeah, I'm--I'm--I'm kinda creeped out by the fact

45
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
that there's something in our chests that's pumping blood.

46
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,000
I do not like that.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I've never been so scared.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,600
And you love every second of it.

49
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,300
Where is everyone today?

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,400
What do I love?

51
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,800
The sneaking around,the cheating on boyfriends,

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,900
being the other woman--you get off on it.

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,000
You know, I bet if I bought this place,

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,100
I could double the business.

55
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,700
ooh! I've always wanted to own my own coffee shop.

56
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,900
We could be partners.

57
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,100
Oh, yeah, and we can live above the store

58
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,500
and have great adventures together.

59
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,000
You know, just because I used to like to sneak around

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
does not mean I still do,all right? 

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,800
It's like,just because if I like chocolate

62
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
before the accident does not mean that I still do.

63
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,400
You're eating a chocolate croissant.

64
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,500
I don't like sneaking around!

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,700
First @hing I would do,I'd fire everyone.

66
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,600
That would be fun.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,700
Ooh!

68
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,000
We could call it "andena."

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,300
Th--that's a combination of both of our names.

70
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,500
I just thought of that.

71
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,800
I mean, I don't--I don't need some kind of buzz,

72
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,300
you know, just to be excited about todd.

73
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,300
Right. That's why you only started liking him

74
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,700
after he started dating chloe.

75
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,900
That is no not tr--

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
yeah.

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,100
Oh, my god. It is.

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,100
, My god. I do like the buzz.

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,100
I love the buzz.

80
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,000
I get off on the buzz.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,200
ow. Okay.
Wait.

82
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,400
Do I hate that about me?

83
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,000
No, I do not.

84
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,600
Well, you know what they say about the forbidden fruit.

85
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,800
No, I do not.

86
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,400
Hey, todd,uh, so I got your message,

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,200
and, uh, 12:00 is good,

88
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,000
so I will meet you on the bridge by the park.

89
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,000
Wait. No one checks these messages but you, right?

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,100
Uh, yeah. So, uh, okay., Yeah, I'll see y, um,

91
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,000
on the thing by the thing.

92
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,000
This is your dry cleaner.

93
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Sam.

94
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,100
Hey. Where are you going dressed all snazzy?

95
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,300
Me?
Uh-huh.

96
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,000
Nowhere.

97
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,700
Just off to play some bridge with the ladies.

98
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,300
Like that?

99
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,500
With the boobs and everything?

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,500
Oh, these? Oh!

101
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,200
Yeah, well, the gals are always showing off theirs,

102
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,800
so I'm like, uh, why not rub mine in their faces?

103
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,900
Pfft!

104
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,300
Um, I'll tell all the gals you said hi.

105
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,600
Yeah. I don't even know who the gals are.

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,700
Te galsI-I can't name them.

107
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,000
Do you know all your friends' names?

108
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,300
I-I gotta go.We tee off in 20 minutes.

109
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,800
Wait.

110
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,900
I thought... you said you were playing bridge.

111
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
We are. Between holes.

112
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,300
The course plays very slow.A lot of old people.

113
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,900
If I ever get like that,pull the plug.

114

115
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,700
where have you been?

116
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,100
sorry. I told chloe I was gonna play basketball...

117
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,500
And I-I wanted it to look real,

118
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,200
so I jumped into a pickup game.

119
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,900
Then it went into overtime,and you had to win by 2 points.

120
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,300
Oh, yeah. I mean, I-I could've helped you get sweaty, but yeah.

121
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,600
Look, I'm sorry.I'm bad at this.

122
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
When she asked me who I was going out with, I blanked.

123
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,900
I couldn't even think of my own friends' names.

124
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,200
I said "lancelot."It was a disaster.

125
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,700
Anyway, I'm here now, so...

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,900
oh, my god!My mother wasn't gonna play golf.

127
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,100
That may be the unsexiest line I've ever heard.

128
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,400
My mother's having an affair.

129
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,500
And we have a new winner.

131
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,600
Your mother's not having an affair.

132
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,700
You didn't see her, all right?

133
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,100
She was definitely sneaking off somewhere to get some strange.

134
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,500
Sam, you're projecting.

135
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,300
You just think she's having an affair because you are.

136
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,100
You think?

137
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,300
Come on. She's not the kind of woman who has an affair, is she?

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,600
No. No, she's the kind of woman who collects roosters.God.

139
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,700
What is the matter with me?

140
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,200
You know what? Nothing. Nothing.

141
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,300
You feel guilty,and you know what?

142
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,000
So do I. That's why I've got to put an end to this.

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You want to stop seeing me?

144
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
No. I'm breaking up with chloe.

145
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,900
Oh! Oh, good!

146
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,900
Wait! No, don'T.

147
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,400
Well, I thought you wanted to be together.

148
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,100
Well, of course I do.I'm just, um, I'm kinda worried.

149
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,600
About what?

150
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,700
About you, 'cause, you know,I, uh, it's just--

151
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,800
I'm--I'm feeling like maybe you're with me because you--

152
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,200
you know, you kinda get off on all this sneaking around.

153
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,100
Yeah, I really don't think--
shh! We're out of time.

154
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,200
well,we should talk about this.

155
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,500
Tomorrow. Tomorrow we will talk about you getting off on all theneaking.

156
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,100
So where do you wanna meet?
At a hotel.Check in as "mty."

157
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,200
Monty. Yeah. What?

158
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,800
I don't know why everyone thinks that sneaking around is so bad.

159
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,300
I mean, spies do it,you know,and--and they're defending the country.

160
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,300
So I'm like a patriot.

161
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,900
Oh, thanks, sam.

162
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,900
You know what? I started to feel so bad about what I was doing

163
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,000
that I actually thought my own mother was screwing around. 

164
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,800
how stupid is that?

165
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,900
You know what?

166
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,700
I think I'm gonna go see how much they want for this place. Hmm.

167
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm gonna go with her.

168
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,800
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

169
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,000
What's going on?

170
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,800
Nothing. I just wanted to watch her negotiate.

171
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,300
why? Is something going on?

172
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,700
Andrea, you know something,and I wanna hear it.

173
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,800
There was an incident a few years ago.

174
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
You and I were coming out of a club.

175
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,300
And?

176
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,000
Sorry. Usually by now,you're like, "oh, my god!"

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And then you remember everything.

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,700
Just tell me the story, please.

179
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
oh, hey!

180
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,200
is that your mom over there?

181
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,000
Th is your mom.

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,700
No, really.Is that your mom?

183
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,200
That's your mom.
No!

184
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,800
oh! That's my mom.

185
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
regina newly!

186
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,300
Sam. Andrea.

187
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,000
What are you doing here?
Me? Nothing.

188
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,700
Just cheese...t-tasting it... 

189
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,000
just tasting cheese with... the gals.

190
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,900
Someone's not wearing her wedding ring.

191
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,600
Oh, well, cheese makes me bloat,especially roquefort and some cheddars,

192
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,200
the occasional goat.Will you stop looking at my fingers?

193
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,300
excuse me. Thank you.

194
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,300
Oh, sweetie, I hate to be the one to tell you this,

195
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,700
but I think your mother's having an affair.

196
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,300
Yeah.

197
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,600
How cool is that?

198
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,400
oh, my god. My mother's been having an affair for years.

199
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,300
Maybe not. I mean, maybe it's--maybe it's something else.

200
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,600
Yeah. No, you're right.I mean, maybe she's, like,

201
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,700
turning tricks to pay for her community college.

202
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,600
Guys, this is gonna kill my father.

203
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,700
Yoknow, my aunt found out that my uncle was having an affair,

204
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,600
and two weeks later, they found her dead from a broken heart...

205
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,600
and a boating accident.

206
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,700
You know, maybe she is telling the truth, though.

207
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,400
Maybe cheese does make her bloat.

208
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,400
I just need to know for sure.

209
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,800
Oh, you could sprinkle parmesan cheese, you know, so--

210
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,200
about the affair, honey.

211
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,200
okay, I was watching oprah last week, and she was talking

212
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,400
about ways to tell if someone's having an affair.

213
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, my god.We both watch oprah.

214
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,400
Oh, my god. We're twins!

215
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,000
The first sign is dieting.

216
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,300
No. I mean,she eats whatever she wants.

217
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:56,900
Bitch.

218
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
Hey, is she doing anything,you know, differnt in bed?

219
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,800
Actually, yeah, she's been doing this new thing with her--I don't know!

220
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,100
Underwear. Underwear. 

221
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,500
Is she buying sexy lingerie?

222
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,300
Andrea,what do you think I do,go rifling through her underwear drawer?

223
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,800
*here mes suspicion *

224
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,400
new.

225
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,100
*Just won't let me be *

226
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
New... new.

227
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,600
New.

228
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,400
Samantha?

229
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,200
Hey, dad. What up?

230
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,900
What the hell is going on in here?

231
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,400
Um... you know, if I, uh,

232
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,000
if I told you, I don't think you'd be very happy.

233
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,100
Well, I don't expect things to make me happy.

234
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,500
I'm from a different generation.

235
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,100
I needed money.

236
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,100
What for?

237
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,200
The concert.

238
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,000
Rock concert.

239
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,700
Yeah, it's this great band.

240
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,400
They're, uh, they're called..."lancelot."

241
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,900
They dress up like knights and stuff.

242
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,600
You wanna go?

243
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
No.Just, um...

244
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,300
clean up in here and... 

245
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,000
come down to nner.

246
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,600
Yeah, it's funny.The--lancelot--they have this song.

247
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
It's called "come to dinner.

248
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
It's like...*come to dinner *

249
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,100
*in the castle of our love... *

250
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,200
yuck.

251
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,100
*here comes suspicion *

252
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
More meat loaf, regina?

253
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
No, just salad.

254
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,400
Oh, really?

255
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,300
You dieting, perhaps?

256
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,100
No, actually,I had a late lunch.

257
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Oh, really? How was it?

258
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,600
Very tasty.I had orange roughy.

259
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah,bet you like it rough-Y.

260
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
What is the matter with you?

261
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Okay, enough. There's something going on under this roof

262
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
that's divided our family for a long time,

263
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,600
and I am not going to stand for it anymore.

264
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,900
Ha! That's right.You tell her, pop.

265
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,400
Regina,our daughter is a junkie.

266
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,100
What?! No, I am not.

267
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,500
Yep. The first response is always denial.

268
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,200
But I caught her going through our drawers

269
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,900
looking for money to get her fix.

270
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,400
That is so not true.

271
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,000
Don't pretend you're going to see that band lancelot,

272
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,600
because according to the internet,

273
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,100
the band does not exist.

274
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,700
That's right.I used the internet.

275
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,800
I thought it might be drugs.

276
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,800
That's probably what caused your memory problem.

277
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,500
I was hit by a car!

278
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
Well, that's what happens when you don't pay your dealer.

279
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh, for heaven sake!

280
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,800
May I be excused?

281
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,400
Thank you.

282
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,200
It's not in my head,all right?

283
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,000
I saw my mother's panties.

284
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm gonna put my shirt on.I'm starting to feel weird.

285
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,200
I cannot believe that she is having an affair 

286
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
with some man right here in this city.

287
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, I wonder if he's paying $300 for a hotel room, too.

288
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,700
Huh? Oh, I know. I know.I'm sorry.

289
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,800
Let's--we can just talk about this later, okay?

290
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,500
All right.
Mm.

291
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,500
I wonder what he looks like.

292
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,100
okay, then.
I'm sure he's latin and all swarthy, 

293
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,900
you know, like..."come on, regina.

294
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,700
Let me make sweet love to you."

295
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,600
That's not latin.That's french.
I don't care.

296
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,800
I'm not calling him "daddy."

297
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,500
I'm sorry.I'm sorry, todd.

298
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
I just--I can't--I can't do this right now.

299
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,200
I need to find out who this guy is,

300
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,700
all right? Rain check?

301
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,500
Yeah.Ooh! Chocolate.

302
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,200
And there's another 8 bucks.

303
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
I've never followed anyone before.

304
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,900
Well, once,but he wanted me to.

305
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,800
I mean, he told me not to,but he wanted me to.

306
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
ooh. Wow. He's cute.

307
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,300
Ooh, yes. If he came into my coffee shop, I wold hire him.

308
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Ooh. He could be our barista,play spanish guitar.

309
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,000
He can emcee on open mike night.

310
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,700
We're not having an open mike night.

311
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,600
you said "we"!

312
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,500
God.I can't take this anymore.

313
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,700
Mother!

314
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,500
Sorry.Sure.

315
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,200
Ll, hello there, darling.

316
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,100
Whatre you doing?

317
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,600
Don't tell me that you're tasting cheese or playing bridge-golf with the gals,

318
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
because I know that you are cheating on dad.

319
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Cheating?
Mm-hmm. Come on, mom.

320
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,300
The makeup,the new lingerie,

321
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,000
the boobs in the afternoon.

322
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,500
I never could fool you,samantha.

323
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,700
You're a smart girl.

324
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,900
That's my fault.I breast-fed you the first four weeks of your life.

325
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,600
So who is he?What's his name?

326
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,900
rory.

327
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,000
Rory? Rory?

328
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Kinda sounds like a dog throwing up.

329
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,500
I realize you're good now,samantha,

330
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,000
and you're no longer subject to the temptations the rest of us feel,

331
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,300
but don't you judge me for something you've done a thousand times.

332
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,400
I'll see you athome fodinner.

333
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,200
I made scalloped potatoes.

334
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,200
Hey.

335
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Now don't get all excited.

336
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
It's not a marijuana plant.

337
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,100
So, um...

338
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,500
where's mom?

339
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,400
I don't know. Upstairs?

340
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,700
Yeah, she's--e's not upstairs, dad.

341
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
She's not even here.

342
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,400
Her car's gone.

343
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,300
Oh, well, she's out then.

344
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,400
See? This is the problem.

345
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,800
You don't even know where she is or who she's with.

346
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,600
Or if they're latin or french or rory.

347
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,900
Okay, I don't care how much it costs.

348
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,200
We're getting you into a program.

349
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,600
Dad, you two are living parallel lives.

350
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,000
Sammy, your mother and i are just fine.

351
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
When two people have been married as long as we have,

352
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,200
you learn to give each other space.

353
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,900
You water a flower too much,it dies.

354
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,500
Yeah, well,if you don't water it enough,

355
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,200
it'll find someone to have sex with who will.

356
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,400
Oh, boy. 

357
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,200
sammy, flowers don't have sex.

358
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,300
It's called cross-pollination.

359
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,800
I got a "time life" book.I'll show you--

360
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,400
that's it. That's it. You know what? You're coming with me.

361
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.Where are we going?

362
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,500
There's something that you need to see, dad.

363
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,700
Okay, but we're taking my car.

364
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,000
Fine.

365
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,700
I'm not gonna get jacked holding some ditch weed and a dub sack of kokomo.

366
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,900
And no more internet!

367
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,300
I'm so sorry, dad.

368
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,000
I thought she had everything she needed.

369
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,600
I mean, what kind of woman does this?

370
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,300
You know,there's no parking here,so why don't you just valet?

371
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,800
I'm not gonna pay $5 for parking.

372
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,700
I'm mad enough.

373
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,300
Now go inside, get your mother,because if I see the man she's with,

374
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm gonna put my fist through his eye!

375
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,300
I'm just gonna circle.

376
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,500
all right.

377
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
sam?
Hmm?

378
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,400
What the hell are you doing here?

379
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
You need to come outside to the car right now.

380
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,800
No, I'm not gonna leave here.You are.

381
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,200
And we will talk about this wh I go home.

382
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,100
two, please.

383
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,200
Do we look like we work here, mister?

384
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,300
Scoot.

385
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,700
Right this way.

386
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
You're not having an affair?

387
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,000
You're a waitress?
Hostess. Thank you.

388
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,900
Oh, what? No, no, no, no, no.

389
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,100
You have to be having an affair,

390
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,400
because--because y-you're not wearing your wedding ring.

391
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,700
Single girls get bigger tips.

392
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay, well,but then what about--what about all that fancyew lingerie?

393
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,300
Oh, well,because I'm your mother,

394
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,200
I can't wear a garter belt and occasional thong?

395
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,300
No, no, you cannot.

396
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,100
I'll see that you get some bread.

397
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,600
A job?

398
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,200
This is your big secret?

399
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,200
Yes. Yes, it was.

400
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,200
One thing in my life that I don't have

401
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,400
to account for to anyone-- it's just mine.

402
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,300
Well, if you're gonna stay here, fold.

403
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,700
I am part of a whole different world here.

404
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,300
Last week,I seated a guy from malaysia.

405
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,500
When would I ever meet people from malaysia?

406
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,200
I mean, lord knows I'd never set foot in that country.

407
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,900
You ld me that you were having an affair.

408
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,800
I mean, you--you--you lied.

409
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,200
Because I knew if I told you I had a job,

410
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
you would tell your father.

411
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,000
But you do not understand him.

412
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,600
Know that man,

413
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,000
and if he ever thought that I needed to or even wanted to work,

414
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,300
he would feel he had failed me completely.

415
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,600
So I let you think it was an affair,

416
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,400
'cause I knew you would never tell him that. 

417
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,600
I found a parking space.

418
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,900
Well, it seems I'm still getting to know you.

419
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,300
All right, where is he, regina?

420
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,700
Tell me where he is so I can rip off his head and feed it to the dog!

421
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,400
Howard. Howard,there isn't anybody here.

422
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,500
Oh, yes, there is.Sammy told me all about it.

423
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,500
No, dad. I was wrong.

424
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,900
Oh, so you're protecting him,too, huh?

425
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,100
All right, I want the truth right now.

426
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,700
Mom. Mom, just tell him.

427
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,400
He'll understand.

428
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,600
Okay.Okay.

429
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,400
Howard...

430
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm ashamed to say that i was going to have an affair...

431
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,500
oh!
But I sent him away.

432
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,300
oh, for pete's sake.

433
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,700
I-I just couldn't do it.

434
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,900
I mean, there he was, sitting across the table from me--

435
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,900
ten years my junior,tall, athletic...

436
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,300
boot-cut jeans.

437
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,600
And I said,"no. No. I love my husband.

438
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,400
"And if I have a problem,

439
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,100
I'm gonna go home,and I'm gonna deal with it."

440
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,700
No. I'm gonna have to deal with it, regina.

441
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Sammy's right.

442
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,800
I've been neglecting you.

443
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,900
W-well, I didn't want to have to be the one to say it,but, uh...

444
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,300
maybe, uh, you know,a gift now and then?

445
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Anything.

446
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,600
Oh, howard.

447
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,400
hi. Two for lunch.

448
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,700
right this way.

449
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,200
Sammy's got a job.
Hmm.

450
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,900
I hope they don't give her a urine test.

451
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,100
psst! Todd! Todd!

452
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Sam?

453
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
wait. What are you doing here? Chloe's upstairs.

454
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,700
I know.That's what I wanna talk to you about.

455
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,400
I wanna be the one upstairs,todd.

456
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,200
You know?Not the one in plant.

457
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,700
I want something stable, todd.

458
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,100
I want something where the people love each ther so much,

459
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,800
they're--they're willing to--to lie very bizarrely

460
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,700
just to--just to protect eachther's feelings.

461
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,000
I-I don't want to sneak around anymore.

462
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,300
So you have to choose.

463
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
It's either chloe or me.

464
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,800
Wait.I was the one who said--

465
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,800
shh! We talk too muc 

466
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,900
???you.

467
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,900
And you know, if I ever want to work, then I am gonna work.

468
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
You got that, bucko?

469
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,400
wait.

470
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,100
 you know that thing about touching the plate after the waiter tells you it's hot?

471
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,900
 The most exciting time is that moment right before you touch it.

472
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,300
 After that, you're just an idiot sitting in a restaurant with a burnt finger.

473
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,000
* I could be wrong  *

474
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,600
*iould be right *

475
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,500
hey, frank.

476
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,900
Miss newly.

477
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,000
Big news.

478
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Todd is going to be my boyfriend.

479
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,500
I guess the man's never heard the phrase,

480
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,400
"fool me twice,shame on me."

481
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,700
oh, funny, funny frank.

482
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,600
 the truth is,one who's had my share of meals,

483
