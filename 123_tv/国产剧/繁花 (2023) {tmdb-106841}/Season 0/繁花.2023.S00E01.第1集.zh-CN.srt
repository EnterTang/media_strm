00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.040
‎你比应聘这类工作的大多数人都年轻
You're younger than most who'd apply for this sort of thing.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.120
‎是什么让你这个年纪的女人
What makes a woman of your age

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.950
‎愿意放弃自己的生活 ‎去照顾别人的孩子
want to give up her life to take care of someone else's children?

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.120
‎放弃美国的生活
A life in America, at that.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.790
‎还是全职工作
Full-time as well.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.950
‎老实说 我觉得很奇怪
It seems odd... to me, to be frank.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.250
‎我也觉得很奇怪
It seems odd to me too.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.750
‎我是说广告
The listing, I mean.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.620
‎全职工作 住在美丽的乡村庄园
A full-time position in a beautiful country manor

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.250
‎照顾两个出色的孩子
to two exceptional children.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.750
‎但我六个月前看过你的广告
But I saw your ad six months ago.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.200
‎我刚到伦敦的时候
When I first arrived in London.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.660
‎此后我每个月都会看到
And I have seen it every month since.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.000
‎我觉得这个工作很容易招到人
Seems to me an easy position to fill.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.660
‎至少像你描述的那样
At least as you've described.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.450
‎所以我想你说得对
So, I suppose you're right.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.450
‎有什么隐情
What is the catch?

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.040
‎这确实是个问题
That really is the question.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.200
‎谢谢
Thank you.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.450
‎你好 詹姆斯
Alright, James?

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.750
‎我知道我没得到这份工作
I know I didn't get the job,

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.790
‎这没关系
and that's totally cool.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.250
‎但这是我生平最尴尬的求职面试
But that was the most awkward job interview of my entire life.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.830
‎我想我们该为此干杯 温格雷夫先生
So, I think we should toast to it, Mr. Wingrave.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.410
‎还是你更喜欢喝茶
Or do you prefer it in your tea?

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.410
‎那么...
So...

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.500
‎现在你可以告诉我吗
you can tell me now, right?

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.200
‎我真的很好奇
I'm honestly so, so curious.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:18.950
‎好奇什么
About what?

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.040
‎隐情
The catch.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.450
‎-不  ‎-不 说吧
- No. - No, come on!

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.790
‎好吧...
Well...

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.160
‎我想是因为想象力
imagination, I suppose.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.790
‎没人想要这份工作
No one wants the job.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.370
得了吧 没人吗
Come on. No one?

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.160
‎我们有段时间招到了人
We did find someone for a while.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.330
‎去年夏天
Last summer.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.910
‎一位有前途的年轻姑娘
A promising young woman.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.370
‎孩子们喜欢她
The children liked her.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.370
‎后来她...
And then, she...

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.450
‎我想她死了
Well, I-I suppose she died.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.580
‎恕我直言 这是她自己的错
It was her own fault, to be blunt.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.540
‎更直白地说 这是她的选择
Her choice, to be blunter,

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.950
‎但她死在了庄园里
but she died on the grounds.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.580
‎人们很迷信 尤其是在乡下
People are superstitious, especially in the country.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.250
‎所以现在这变成了故事
So, now it's a story.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.870
‎这些小孩和他们死去的父母 ‎住在那座大房子里
These small children in that huge house with their dead parents,

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.410
‎现在还有他们死去的家庭教师
and now, their dead governess.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.750
‎哪怕他们的父母死在国外
Never mind the parents died abroad.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.500
‎哪怕家庭教师是自杀的
Never mind the governess took her own...

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.910
‎是的 这个故事发生在招聘前
So, yes, the story precedes the job,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.800
‎至少所有的中介都知道
at least at all the agencies.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.080
‎现在没人想要这份工作
Now, no one wants it.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.250
‎迷信...
Superstition...

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.120
‎想象力
imagination.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.700
‎那你呢
What about you?

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.620
‎你有什么隐情
What was your catch?

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:40.950
‎我...
I...

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.250
‎不能再待在国内
couldn't be at home anymore.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.080
‎你教过有25个孩子的班级吗
Have you ever taught a classroom of 25 kids?

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.450
‎不 恐怕我绝对没有
No, I absolutely have not, I'm afraid.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.040
‎好吧...
Well...

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:57.450
‎你会喜欢他们
you take to them.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.200
‎你爱他们
You love them.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.370
‎即使是最坏的孩子
Even the worst ones.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.080
‎你是这么做的
You just do.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.080
‎你试着帮忙...
And you try to help...

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.370
‎但是孩子太多了
but there's just too many of them.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.450
‎你的作用太小
And too little of you.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.000
‎所以你就...
So, you just...

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.250
‎广告说有两个孩子
The ad said two children.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.660
‎我不知道具体情况 ‎但我知道怎么管教孩子
I figure I don't know the specifics, but I know how to handle kids.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.620
‎也许我能有所作为
Maybe I can make a difference.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.080
‎我可以有所作为
I could. I could make a difference.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:32.830
‎真的有所作为
A real difference.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.910
‎只教两个孩子
With just two.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.700
‎然后我注意到这是...
Then I noticed the position was...

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.580
‎全职住家工作
full-time, live-in.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.620
‎然后我明白了 他们失去了某个人
And then it clicked. They've lost someone.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.080
‎我能理解死亡
Now, I understand death.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.540
‎我知道失去代表着什么
I know what loss is.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.080
‎我要在英国多待一段时间
I'm gonna be in England a while longer.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.410
‎其实是很长时间
Quite a while, actually.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.750
‎我找到了工作
I got a job.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:29.160
‎是啊 我的工作有试用期 ‎至少到夏天结束
Yeah, I got a trial position, at least to the end of the summer.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.750
‎但可能持续很长...
But it could go on for quite...

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.450
‎不 我知道比我说的时间长 ‎但我找到工作了
No, I know. I know it's longer than I said, but I got a job.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.040
‎我没有
I'm not.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.370
‎我没有逃避什么
I'm not running from anything,

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.540
‎你这么说让我很难过
and it hurts me when you say that.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.830
‎你知道 你这么说让我很难过
You know it hurts me when you say that.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.580
‎无论如何...
Anyway...

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.870
‎等我到了庄园 你可以联系我
you can reach me when I get to the house.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.080
‎等我拿到号码就打电话给你
I'll call you... when I have the number.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.370
‎我爱你 妈妈
I love you, Mom.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.450
‎-克莱顿小姐  ‎-是的

‎-很高兴认识你  ‎-见到你很高兴
- Pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.040
‎-我来拿  ‎-好的 我有几个包
- Let me get... Let's get that. - Yeah. I have some bags.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.330
‎没关系 谢谢
No worries. Thank you.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:43.830
‎谢谢
Thank you.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.660
‎不好意思 乡间小路
Sorry about that. Country roads.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.040
‎我睡了多久
How long was I out?

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.290
‎一会儿
A while.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.250
‎你还在过美国时间吗
Are you still on American time?

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.500
不
No.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.750
‎我只是最近没怎么睡觉
I just haven't got much sleep lately.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.370
‎旅馆不是很清静
Well, hostels aren't terribly restful.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.200
‎你会发现外面要安静得多
I mean, you'll find it much quieter out here.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.790
‎-真漂亮  ‎-是吗
- It's gorgeous. - Is it?

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.410
‎什么
What?

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.250
‎我自己也搞不懂
I can't tell anymore, personally.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.660
‎我出生在布莱
I was born in Bly.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.160
‎我是说小镇 不是庄园
The town, I mean, not the manor.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.500
‎我离开了一阵子
I escaped for a bit.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.200
‎在法国待过一段时间
Spent some time in France.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.290
‎-什么  ‎-学习当厨师
- What? - Studying to be a chef.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.750
‎我还以为你是司机
Yet, here I was, just thinking you were a driver.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.450
‎不 只是偶尔开车 ‎要是亨利拜托我的话
No, no, no, only sometimes, when Henry asks me.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.910
‎说实话 我开车的技术很烂
Frankly, I'm a rubbish driver.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.450
‎但我的厨艺还不错
But not a bad cook, turns out.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.250
‎你为什么回来
Why'd you come back?

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.250
‎-离开法国  ‎-家人
- From France? - Family.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.330
‎我在这里工作可以养活自己
And this job pays the bills, while I'm here.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.970
‎我离家也近
And it keeps me close.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.660
‎相信我 人们会困在更糟的地方
Well, there are worse places to be stuck, believe me.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.330
‎我其实从不喜欢布莱
I've actually never liked Bly.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.830
‎这里的大多数人都不喜欢
The people here, most of them,

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.660
‎他们生在这里 死在这里
they're born here, they die here.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.750
‎整个小镇就像巨大的重力井
The whole town is one big gravity well.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.040
‎很容易陷进去
And it's easy to get stuck.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.370
‎天啊 这是...
God, is that...

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.450
‎我说过 很可爱
Like I said, plenty to love.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.790
‎我可以下车走完剩下的路吗
Can I get out and walk the rest of the way?

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:41.870
‎♪ 唱着 "哦 伤心的柳树" ♪
♪ Singing, "O willow waly" ♪

‎这首歌真好听
What a beautiful song!

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:58.830
‎什么歌
What song?

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.120
‎-你刚才唱的歌  ‎-你是克莱顿小姐
- The one you were just singing. - You're Miss Clayton!

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.200
‎一定是你
You must be.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.000
‎你真是太漂亮了
And you're so pretty.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.250
‎我告诉过迈尔斯 你很漂亮
I told Miles you'd be pretty.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.830
真的非常棒
How perfectly splendid!

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:12.080
‎你一定是弗洛拉
You must be Flora.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.700
‎我希望我没有吓到你
I hope I didn't startle you.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.620
‎怎么会 我在等你
Not at all. You're expected.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.330
‎我很高兴你能来
I'm just so, so pleased you're here.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.620
‎格罗斯太太想见你
And Mrs. Grose will want to see you.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.540
还有迈尔斯
And Miles.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.660

‎你知道 我见过欧文了
You know, I've met Owen.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.830
‎你什么时候见过欧文
When did you meet Owen?

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.040
‎坐在车上的时候
On the car ride up.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:29.870
‎那是什么
Now, what's that?

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:31.830
‎这个
This.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.910
‎只是个蠢东西 真的
Just a silly thing, really.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.200
‎稍等一下
Just a moment.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.500
‎-这湖真漂亮  ‎-别这么说
- What a gorgeous lake. - You mustn't.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.000
‎这只是个臭气熏天的老池塘
It really is just a smelly old pond.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.150
‎你知道 里面有水蛭
And, you know, there are leeches in there.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.080
可怕的小东西 比如吸血鼻涕虫
Horrid little things, like vampire slugs,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.870
‎还有最恶心的甲虫
and the nastiest beetles.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.580
‎谁要那个老池塘
Who needs that old pond, anyway?

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.080
‎世上还有那么多更好的东西
There's so much else that's so much better.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.500
‎见到你真的非常棒
It really is perfectly splendid to meet you.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.500
‎迈尔斯

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.120
‎她来了 ‎她来了
She's here! She's here!

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.500
‎她比我想象的还要漂亮
And she's even prettier than I imagined.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:07.450
‎这就是她
This is her!

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.580

‎很高兴见到你 小姐
So pleased to meet you, my lady.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.410
真有绅士风度
Well, what the gentleman.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.410
‎这一定是格罗斯太太
And this must be Mrs. Grose.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.620
‎-嗨  ‎-不好意思...
- Hi! - I'm sorry...

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.620
‎天哪 我刚才走神了
Goodness, I wa... I was miles away.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.040
‎我是丹妮
I'm Dani.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.580
‎很高兴见到你 我是汉娜·格罗斯
It's a pleasure to meet you. Hannah Grose.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.580
你平安到达了
Well, I see you made it in one piece.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.700
‎-是啊  -路上还好吗
- Yeah. - Was the journey okay?

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.040
很顺利
It was perfect.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.620
‎-太好了  ‎-是啊
- Wonderful. - Yeah.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.830
‎是的 欧文是个不错的年轻人
Yes, that... that Owen is a fine young man.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.700
‎很好的人
Good sort.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.450
‎好了 我们进去吧
Right, well, let... let's find our way inside.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.080
‎我相信克莱顿小姐一定很想看看房子
I'm sure Miss Clayton is eager to see the house.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.120
‎-是的  -好吧 跟我来
- Yes. - Right, well, come along.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.830
‎-现在...  ‎-你叫我丹妮就行
- Now... - You can call me Dani.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.750
‎那怎么行
Nonsense.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.700
‎孩子们 我们说好了 ‎你们要叫她克莱顿小姐
Children, you will call her Miss Clayton, like we agreed.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.660
‎她第一眼看到布莱 没有感到不自在
Her first look at Bly yielded no discomfort,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.290
‎也没有不祥的预感
no foreboding.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.200
‎就像温格雷夫爵士描述的一样
It was exactly as Lord Wingrave had described.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.200
‎一个不错的好地方
A great, good place.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.660
‎这里敞开大门欢迎她到家
And it yawned open to welcome her home.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.290
‎这是门厅
This is the foyer,

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.120
‎真的非常棒
and it's perfectly splendid.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.660
‎-太美...  ‎-来吧
- It's beauti... - Come along!

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.330
‎这是厨房
This is the kitchen,

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.790
‎真的非常棒
and it's perfectly splendid.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.620
‎这是欧文
And this is Owen.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.330
‎他是厨师
He's the cook,

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.750
‎他也很棒
and he's splendid.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.950
‎非常棒
Perfectly.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
‎大家好
Hello, everyone.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.080
‎又见面了
Again.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.000
‎嗨
Hi!

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.120
‎嗨 弗洛拉
Hi, Flora.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.500
‎这边请
This way.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.580
‎这些画全是真迹
The paintings are all original,

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.160
‎也就是说 都是手绘的
which means they're painted by hand,

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.540
‎它们真的非常棒
and they're perfectly splendid.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.000
‎这就是教室
This is the classroom.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.500
‎这里...
It's...

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.160
‎挺无聊的
quite boring.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.950
‎这是可爱的楼梯 但你不能在上面跑
These are the lovely stairs, but you mustn't run on them.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.100
‎要是跌倒了 你会受伤的 ‎楼梯可不宽容
If you fall, you can injure yourself, and the stairs are not forgiving.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.080
‎一点也不宽容 你看到了吗
Not forgiving in the least. Do you see?

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.200
‎格罗斯太太说 爬楼梯对膝盖很不好...
Mrs. Grose says they're brutal on the knees...

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.120
‎可我没什么感觉
but I don't have any issues.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.960
‎-真气派  ‎-是啊
- Gorgeous! - It is.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.720
‎这个地方很不错 是孩子们的天堂
A great good place. Heaven for the children.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:15.120
‎但当心楼梯 爬楼梯对膝盖很不好
But mind the stairs, they're brutal on the knees.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.870
‎这是我们父母从前住的地方
And this is where our parents used to live.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.120
‎我们不再去了
We don't go in there anymore.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.500
我们不再去了 全遮起来了
We don't go in there anymore. It's all covered up.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.290
‎恐怕这个房间现在锁上了
This room is closed at the moment.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.910
‎遮起来了 但是全在下面
And covered up. But underneath it all,

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.870
‎一切真的非常棒
it's all just perfectly splendid.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.830
‎我们让克莱顿小姐梳洗一下
Let's leave Miss Clayton to freshen up.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.290
‎当然
Of course.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.620
‎但我们必须带她参观雕像花园
But then we must show her the statue garden.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.450
她早晚会看到的 弗洛拉
She'll see it all eventually, Flora.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.290
‎等你安顿好了 我们再来看你
We'll see you after you've settled.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.580
‎等你安顿好了 我们带你看其他地方
And once you have, we'll have to show you the rest.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.500
‎弗洛拉
Flora!

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.580
‎来了
Coming.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.910
‎不好意思 我可以进来吗
I'm sorry. May I come in?

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.660
‎是的 当然
Yes. Of course.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.080
‎也许从现在开始学会敲门
Perhaps knock from now on.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:15.410
‎当然
Of course.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.750
‎我只想说 你来了让我们很开心
I just wanted to say how happy we all are that you're here.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.000
‎给你这个
And to give you this.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.000
‎不算什么 我知道
Not much, I know.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.870
‎只是件小东西 让你感到宾至如归
Just a little something to make you feel more welcome.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:30.750
‎谢谢
Thank you.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.660
‎很漂亮
It's very pretty.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.410
‎我先把这里收拾完 等会见好吗
I'm just gonna finish up here and see you in a few minutes, okay?

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.500
‎当然了
Of course.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.410
‎谢谢
Thank you.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.250
我希望你别介意
I hope it's all right.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:02.410
‎我还没弄明白茶 所以...
I haven't quite figured out tea yet, so...

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.120
‎没事 亲爱的
It's fine, dear.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.450
‎晚餐准备好了
Dinner is served.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:12.290
‎给你 孩子  ‎
There you go, mate.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.790
-谢谢  -欧文做的晚餐最好吃
- Thank you. - Owen makes the best dinners.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.120
‎他给我做过一次 ‎通心粉和奶酪三明治
He made me a macaroni-and-cheese sandwich once,

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.040
‎很好吃
which was divine.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.000
‎是什么让你这样的美国年轻人来到英国
So, what brings a young American like you to England?

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.450
而且偏偏来到布莱
And Bly of all places.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.620
‎你知道 只是想见识世界
You know, just wanted to see the world.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.900
‎目前为止 你觉得怎么样
And what do you think of it so far?

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.700
‎-布莱 还是世界  ‎-我想去澳大利亚
- Bly? Or the world? - I want to go to Australia.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.830
‎或者佛罗里达 跟我的名字很像
Or Florida, because it's almost my name.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.870
‎没错
That's right.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.120
‎-这里真是太美了  ‎-是啊
- It's just so gorgeous here. - Yeah.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:45.870
‎我一直这么说 但想不出别的词
I know I keep saying that, but there's no other word.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.290
‎-我倒能想出几个  ‎-闭嘴吧 欧文
- I could think of a few others. - Hush now, Owen.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.250
‎-他喜欢捉弄我  ‎-她喜欢被捉弄
- He likes to wind me up. - She likes being wound up.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.250
‎你不跟我们一起吃吗
Aren't you joining us?

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.450
‎今晚不行 亲爱的 我得回家看我妈妈
Not tonight, sweetheart. I've got to go home to my mom.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.580
‎令人失望
Disappointing.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.620
‎你的口气跟她一模一样
You sound just like her.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.290
‎她感觉好些了吗
Is she feeling better?

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:04.370
‎好多了
Much.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:06.120
‎我觉得每天都越来越好
Better every day, I reckon.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.450
‎好了
All right.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.870
‎晚安 你这位可爱的小姐
Good night, you lovely young lady.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.080
‎也祝你晚安 弗洛拉
And good night to you, too, Flora.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.040
‎老天保佑我 这家伙
Heaven help me, this man.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.120
‎好好享用
Enjoy.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.200
‎他和他母亲一起生活
So, he lives with his mother?

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.040
‎更像是为她而活着
Lives for her, more like.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.290
‎这就是他从巴黎回来的原因
That's why he came back from Paris.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.700
‎她病了 我听说病得很重
She took ill. Quite ill, I've heard.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:28.080
‎-真遗憾  ‎-是啊
- I'm sorry. - Yeah.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.620
‎他说她在好转
He said she's getting better.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.870
‎每天都越来越好
Yeah, better every day.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.500
‎他是这么说 可最近他走得越来越早
He says that, but he leaves earlier and earlier these days.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.370
‎他过去每晚都留下来吃晚饭
He used to stay every night for supper.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.450
‎也许她感觉很好 可以吃东西了
Maybe she feels well enough to eat,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.250
‎所以他必须及时回家给她做饭
so he has to get home in time to cook for her.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.330
‎我相信你说得对 亲爱的
I'm sure you're right, sweetheart.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.410
‎怎么 你不吃吗
What? You're not gonna eat?

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.250
是的
Well, yeah.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.040
‎-我等会儿吃  ‎-好的
- I'll have it later. - Okay.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.220
‎我会指点你的
I'll give you some pointers.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.750
‎谢谢
Thank you.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.540
‎我希望看起来像个矮人
I wish to look like a gnome.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.620
‎泡沫矮人
A bubble gnome.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.910
‎你肯定能行
Well, you're sure getting there.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.830
‎什么
What?

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.950
‎这真的很傻 不是吗
It really is very silly, isn't it?

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.950
‎是的 你是个很傻的女孩
Yes, you're a very silly girl.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:24.700
‎你从哪里弄到的
Where did you get that?

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.160
‎-什么  ‎-那个蝴蝶发夹
- What? - The butterfly clip.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:31.750
‎迈尔斯送给我的
Miles gave it to me.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.830
‎他不该那么做
He shouldn't have done that.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.160
‎为什么不行
Why not?

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.790
‎因为那不是你的东西
Because it doesn't belong to you.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.410
‎那是谁的东西
Who does it belong to?

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.040
‎-杰塞尔小姐  ‎-那是谁
- Miss Jessel. - Who's that?

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:49.870
‎另一个人
The other one.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.950
‎-你的前任  ‎-我...
- Before you. - I'm...

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:53.910
‎我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
‎我...
I...

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.290
‎我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.040
‎我错了 其实没什么
I was wrong. It's actually fine.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.830
‎我现在能出来了吗
Can I get out now?

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.120
‎我可以玩我的娃娃吗
Can I play with my dolls?

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.660
‎可以 15分钟 好吗
Yeah. Fifteen minutes, okay?

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.950
我去过你能想到的各种学校
You know, I've gone to every kind of school you can think of.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.160
‎真的
Have you?

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.540
‎我还上过寄宿学校 像你一样
Even a boarding school once, like you.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.370
‎我知道这有多难
I know how hard it can be.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:49.370
‎没那么糟糕
It's not so bad.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.200
‎好吧...
Well...

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.910
‎你现在回家了 不是吗
you're home now, aren't you?

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.160
‎听着 你想跟我说什么都可以
Look, you can talk to me about whatever you'd like.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.200

About school.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.160
‎学校发生的任何事
Anything that happened there.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.750
‎我保证 我都听说了
I promise, I've heard it all.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:11.580
‎你真是太好了
It's very kind of you.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.120
‎晚安 丹妮
Good night, Dani.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.080
‎晚安
Good night.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.160
‎对了 格罗斯太太似乎认为 ‎你应该叫我克莱顿小姐
You know, Mrs. Grose seems to think you should call me Miss Clayton.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.120
‎你不喜欢吗
Didn't you like it?

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.120
‎你说什么
I'm sorry?

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.660
‎蝴蝶发夹
The butterfly.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.120
‎我...
I...

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.040
‎我觉得 ‎弗洛拉...
You know, Flora...

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.200
有点不高兴
was a little upset, I think.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.160
‎她总是有点不高兴
She's always a little upset.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.660
‎不管她承不承认
Whether she admits it or not.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.290
‎但她很高兴你来了
But she's so, so glad you're here.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.040
‎我也是
And so am I.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.870
‎谢谢你让我感到宾至如归
Well, thank you for making me feel so welcome.

‎睡觉了
Bedtime!

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.250
‎我刚收拾好
And I'm finished.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:08.950
‎时间刚好
Perfect timing.

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:12.870
‎那是我吗
Is that me?

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.080
‎才不是 傻子 你就是你
Why, no, silly. You're you.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.000
‎这只是个娃娃
It's just a dolly.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.500
‎说得对
Touché.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.200
‎这些都是谁
Who are all these?

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.750
‎怎么 他们当然都是娃娃
Why, they're dolls, of course.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.790
‎小姐 你有很多娃娃
You, miss, have a lot of dolls,

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.450
‎我们要学会在睡觉前
and we're going to learn

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.120
‎把娃娃都收起来 好吗
how to pick them all up before we go to sleep, okay?

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.200
‎把她放回去
Put her back.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.450
‎她就待在...
She stays...

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.040
‎那里
there.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.000
‎你们都盖好被子
And you're all tucked in.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.000
‎现在该睡觉了
And it's time for bed.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.580
‎你来了真是太好了
It's just lovely that you're here.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:13.790
‎谢谢你 弗洛拉
Thank you, Flora.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:16.950
‎但你得答应我一件事
But you have to promise me something.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:18.410
‎当然
Of course.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.370
‎你得答应我
You have to promise me

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.540
‎你会待在你的房间
that you'll stay in your room.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:25.080
‎晚上不要离开你的房间
Don't leave your room at night.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.200
‎在床上待到天亮
Stay in your bed until morning.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.620
‎我想我不能答应
I don't think I can promise that.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.260
‎但对你和你哥哥来说 ‎这肯定是好规矩...
But it's certainly a good rule for you and your brother...

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.580
‎但你必须答应
But you must.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.700
‎好吧
Okay.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.660
‎至少今天晚上
At least for tonight.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.250
‎现在去睡吧
Now get some sleep.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:53.120
‎这天夜里 家庭教师辗转难眠
The night found the au pair restless.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.950
‎像弗洛拉说的那样
It was as Flora had said.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.750
‎房间在晚上变大了
The rooms were larger at night,

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.000
‎仿佛太阳落山的时候
as though the house itself had inhaled deeply

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.370
‎这座房子深吸了一口气
as the sun disappeared,

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.500
‎不断扩大 屏住呼吸等待早晨的到来
expanding as it held its breath for the morning.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.790
‎这种扩张感不仅存在于室内
That sense of expansion wasn't only indoors, either.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.040
‎向外望去 她发现露台和整个庄园
Gazing out, she found that the terrace and the whole place,

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.950
‎草坪和外面的花园
the lawn and the garden beyond it,

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.950
‎她能看到的地方都空无一人
and all she could see of the park, were empty,

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.790
‎空空荡荡
with a great emptiness.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.660
‎这种空旷让人想一探究竟
An emptiness that called out to be explored.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:29.540
‎挺好喝的啊
Tastes good to me.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.250
‎今天天气真好
What a beautiful day.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.700
‎我发誓 我永远不会厌倦这个地方
Well, I'll never get tired of this place, I swear.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.330
‎怎么了
What's the matter?

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.200
‎我很生你的气
I'm very cross with you.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.450
‎克莱顿小姐
Miss Clayton!

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.790
‎过来看看我发现了什么
Come see what I found!

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:17.160
‎你昨晚离开了房间 ‎可你答应不会的
You left your room last night even though you promised you wouldn't.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.160
‎-克莱顿小姐  ‎-你怎么知道的
- Miss Clayton! - How do you know that?

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.000
‎你必须待在你的房间里
You've got to stay in your room.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:21.950
‎快来看
Come and see!

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.250
‎-怎么了  ‎-这样她就看不到你
- Why? - So she doesn't see you.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.580
‎谁
Who?

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:27.750
‎那位女士
The lady.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:30.870
‎什么女士
What lady?

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.120
‎-湖中的女士  ‎-弗洛拉
- The lady in the lake. - Flora.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.580
‎弗洛拉 你看
Flora, look.

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:42.370
‎克莱顿小姐...
Miss Clayton...

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.200
‎看
Look!

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.700
‎听着 我已经当了九年老师 迈尔斯
Look, I've been a teacher for nine years, Miles.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.410
‎跟你的年龄差不多大
That's almost your whole life.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.300
‎这些年
In all that time,

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.620
很多孩子想尽办法吓唬我
a lot of kids have tried to scare me in a lot of different ways,

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:03.410
‎你知道我学到了什么吗
and you know what I learned?

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.700
‎我比人们想的要勇敢得多
I'm a lot braver than people think.

00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:10.450
‎也包括我
Including me.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.750
‎我没想吓唬你 克莱顿小姐
I wasn't trying to scare you, Miss Clayton.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.400
‎我知道你不会害怕
I knew you wouldn't be frightened.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.200
‎是吗
Did you?

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.790
‎当然 我一看就知道你是这样的人
Of course. I knew that about you right away.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.040
‎你在学校经常做这种事吗
Is that something you used to do at school?

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:27.370
‎搞恶作剧
Play pranks?

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.330
‎捣蛋
Tricks.

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:32.910
‎我从来不太明白捣蛋的意思
I never quite saw the point of tricks.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.660
‎你叔叔跟我说过一些你在学校的问题
Your uncle told me a little bit about your problems at school.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.290
‎你和我叔叔谈过了
You spoke with my uncle?

00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:43.250
‎当然 他雇了我
Well, of course. He hired me.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.250
‎他问起我们了吗
Did he ask about us?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.870
‎他说的全是你们两个
All he did was talk about you two.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.620
‎他很想你们两个
He misses you both.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:55.910
‎非常想
Very much.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.540
‎不 他不想
No, he doesn't.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:02.290
‎他当然想
Of course he does.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.700
‎我们要不要给他打电话问问
Shall we give him a ring and ask?

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.000
‎家庭教师为男孩的痛苦而心痛
The au pair's heart ached for the boy's pain.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.950
‎但就像布莱的天气一样
But, like the very weather at Bly,

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:13.910
他的情绪变化很快
his moods proved quick to change.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.040
‎就像太阳 云和雨会毫无预兆地出现
As sun, clouds, and rain would appear without hint or warning,

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.500
‎孩子们的情绪也是如此
so, too, did the children's moods.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.950
‎仿佛时间和自然...
As though time and nature held...

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.540
‎专为他们制定了...
secret laws...

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.200
‎秘密法则
just for them.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.160
‎她来了
There she is.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:11.950
‎他们扔下我跑了
They got away from me.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.870
‎不 我去接电话 你坐吧
No, I'll get it. You have a seat.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:15.950
‎放松点
Relax.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:17.660
‎如果可以的话
If that's even possible.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:19.910
‎你好
Hello?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.080
‎午餐吃什么
What's for lunch?

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.910
‎-香肠配土豆泥  ‎-喂
- Bangers and mash. - Hello?

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.160
‎喂
Hello?

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:26.370
‎弗洛拉 别这样
Flora, don't.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.120
‎-谁打来的  ‎-不知道 电话挂了
- Who was it? - Don't know. They hung up.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.290
‎-又来了  ‎-又一个
- Again? - Another one?

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.950
‎我们接过几个恶作剧电话
We've had some, prank calls.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.790
‎-可能是打错了  ‎-谢谢
- Probably just a wrong number. - Thank you.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:39.910
‎不客气
You're welcome.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.750
‎克莱顿小姐
Miss Clayton.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:43.250
‎谢谢
Thank you.

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:49.680
‎园丁没有向新来的家庭教师
The gardener did not even introduce herself

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.700
‎做自我介绍
to the new au pair.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.950
‎她几乎不认识她
She barely acknowledged her at all.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.910
‎只是把她当做一直在那里的人
Simply treated her as if she'd always been there.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.120
‎房间里其他人还以为 ‎她们已经见过了
The others in the room just assumed they'd already met,

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.750
‎如果她没说谎
which, if she were honest,

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.830
‎这就是家庭教师第一次看到这个年轻女人的感觉
was how the au pair felt when she first saw the young woman.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.410
‎是谁决定喂养这些小精怪的
So, who decided it was a good idea to feed these wee gremlins?

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.080
‎我们不是小精怪
We're not gremlins!

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.250
‎我们是乖孩子
We're very good children.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.330
‎是这样吗
Is that right?

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.040
‎我可不确定
See, I'm not so sure.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.660
‎欧文 你觉得呢
Owen, what do you think?

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.250
‎很难说
It's hard to say.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.000
‎我得给他们浇点水才能确定
I'm gonna have to get water on them to be sure.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.370
‎像这样吗
Like this?

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:31.830
‎给你
There you go.

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:36.470
‎-给你 亲爱的  ‎-你太好了 谢谢
- There you go, dear. - You're a star. Thank you.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.910
‎今天有没有人...
Was there somebody...

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.160
‎在庄园里干活
working on the grounds today?

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:41.910
‎也许是修理工什么的
Maybe a repairman or something?

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.450
‎不 我想没有
No, I don't believe so.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.370
‎因为我进来的时候
'Cause I saw a guy,

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:47.160
‎看见有人在护墙上
on the parapet, on my way in.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:49.330
‎在护墙上
On the parapet?

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.500
‎是啊
Yeah.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.200
‎-无法想象  ‎-我没上去过
- Can't imagine. - I've not been up there.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:55.770
怎么会呢
Well, why would you?

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:57.580
你确定看到上面有人吗
Are you sure you saw someone up there?

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.370
‎绝对没错 我挥手了 他没有回应
Absolutely. I waved, he didn't wave back.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:02.540
‎偶尔会有闲逛的人
Well, we do get ramblers sometimes.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.500
‎有人想看看花园
People that wanna have a look at the gardens.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.850
‎他们随意走动 但如果有人爬上护墙...
They take liberties, but if one made it onto the parapet...

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:09.260
‎他们上不去 不穿过房子是上不去的
They can't get up there, not without going through the house.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:11.090
‎只有穿过老楼才能上去
The only way up there is through the old wing.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:12.450
‎我们不能去哪里
And where don't we go?

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.620
‎老楼
The old wing.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.750
‎这肯定是你的幻觉 亲爱的
You must have imagined it, dear.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:25.080
‎-你不吃饭吗  ‎-不 我吃过了
- You're not gonna eat anything? - No, I already ate.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.500
‎只是来陪你们
Just here for the company.

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.000
‎你一定要尝尝这个
You must try this.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.290
‎弗洛拉 别这样
Flora, don't.

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.910
‎你找到那个人了
Did you... Did you find anyone?

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:55.660
‎没有
No.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:56.950
‎我没找到
I didn't.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.200
‎但是...
But...

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.290
‎我确实找到了...
I did find some...

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:02.830
‎对不起 我打扰你了吗
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting you?

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:04.080
‎不 一点也没有
No. No, not at all.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.160
‎你发现了什么
What did you find?

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.160
‎是弗洛拉
It's Flora.

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:14.500
‎-弗洛拉...  ‎-我见过几个这样的孩子
- Flora, Flora... - I've seen a few of these.

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:16.790
‎你不能这样评判他们
Well, you can't judge them.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.620
‎尤其是他们经历了这些事
Not after what they've been through.

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.910
‎温格雷夫先生肯定跟你说过他们的父母
Mr. Wingrave told you about their parents, I'm sure.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:24.830
‎只说他们过世了
Only that they passed.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:27.500
‎两年前的这个时候
Two years ago, now.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.080
‎迈尔斯只有八岁 弗洛拉六岁
Miles was only eight. Flora, six.

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.580
‎两个孩子真够倒霉的
And that's enough bad luck for two children to bear,

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:35.700
‎可是想到...
but then to think...

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.660
‎后来发生的事情
what came after.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:40.790
‎你的前任
Your... your predecessor.

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:43.500
‎-杰塞尔小姐  ‎-是的
- Miss Jessel? - Yeah.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:45.410
‎丽贝卡
Rebecca.

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:48.580
‎天啊...
God...

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:50.580
‎丽贝卡 可怜的丽贝卡
Rebecca. Poor Rebecca.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:52.910
‎她是...
She was...

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.410
‎她是个聪明的年轻人
She was a bright young thing.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:58.950
‎她雄心勃勃 聪慧过人
She was ambitious, intelligent.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.120
‎心地善良
Kind of heart.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
‎但是...
But...

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:08.500
‎有个男人
there was a man.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.660
‎真的只有这种事能毁掉这样的女人
Which really is the only thing that can bring down a woman like that.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.790
‎世间所有的恶行披着优雅的外衣
All the world's vices in disguise of its graces.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.660
‎总之 他的事说得越少越好
Anyway, the less said about him, the better.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.500
‎你知道他逃跑了吗
You know he skipped town?

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.000
‎卷走了亨利的一大笔钱 ‎还有那可怜姑娘的心
With a tidy sum of Henry's money and the poor thing's heart.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.790
‎偷了很多东西 手脚不干净
Stole a lot, that one. Sticky fingers.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.120
‎在逃走前几天还见过她
And to see her in the days leading up to it.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.250
‎多么伤心
So broken.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200
‎多么空虚
So empty.

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:42.910
‎在她投入湖中之前 她早就走了
She was gone long before she waded into that lake.

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.330
‎弗洛拉发现了她
Flora found her.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.200
‎杰米发现了弗洛拉
And Jamie found Flora.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.290
‎听她说...
To hear her tell it...

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:55.580
‎丽贝卡的尸体在水里
Rebecca's body in that water.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:57.870
‎脸朝下
Face down.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:00.750
‎小弗洛拉只是...
And little Flora just...

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.160
‎一动不动...
stone-still...

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.200
‎瞪着眼睛
staring.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.200
‎我...
And I...

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.080
‎从前我听到孩子们在房子里跑来跑去...
To think I used to cringe when I heard the children...

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.410
‎尖叫吵闹的时候 我感到很尴尬
running through the house, screaming and kicking up a fuss.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.370
‎但在杰塞尔小姐去世后的几周里...
But in the weeks after Miss Jessel there...

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.160
‎寂静从未让人感到如此可怕
Silence, it never felt so terrible.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.540
‎现在...
And now...

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.370
‎现在我听到他们...
Now, when I hear them...

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.330
‎哭闹...
cry, or...

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:32.250
‎大吼大叫...
scream, or yell...

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.540
‎天啊 这是世界上最动听的声音
God, it's the most beautiful sound in the world.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.500
‎-我很抱歉  ‎-不
- I'm so sorry. - No.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.200
‎-没关系  ‎-天啊 看看我
- It's all right. - God, look at me.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.040
‎这是个护身符
It's a talisman.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.000
‎弗洛拉的小游戏 ‎保佑我们所有人的安全
A tiny game of Flora's to keep us all safe.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:02.910
‎我们
Us.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.790
‎天啊 那些孩子
God. My God, these children.

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:09.660
‎我想 他们都在用自己的方式 ‎努力适应
Both of them trying in their own way, I think.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.040
‎你知道 我该回去了
You know, I should head back.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:17.750
‎欧文和杰米今晚要离开
Owen and Jamie will be leaving for the evening.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.790
‎要是你愿意的话 ‎我很高兴在睡前照看孩子们
But I'm happy to watch the children before bed if you'd like a moment.

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.870
‎这些蜡烛是为谁点的
What are the candles for?

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:26.290
‎死人
The dead.

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:29.750
‎我年龄越大 死人就越多 ‎超乎我的想象
There's more of them than I'd like, the older I get.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:30.660
‎对不起
I'm sorry.

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.580
‎天哪 没必要
God, no need.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.910
‎我从前是个幸福的女人 现在也是
I have been, and I remain, a very happy woman.

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.700
‎晚上好 克莱顿小姐
Good evening, Miss Clayton.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:55.790
‎该睡觉了
Time for bed.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.540
‎是吗
Is it?

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.700
‎我不想睡觉
I shouldn't think so.

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:02.700
‎别玩游戏了 迈尔斯
No more games, Miles.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.410
‎你喜欢游戏吗 丹妮
Do you like games, Dani?

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.080
‎不是在睡觉的时候
Not at bedtime.

‎现在是玩游戏最好的时间 真的
It's the best time for games, really.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.370

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.870
‎他有时真的很奇怪
He's so weird sometimes.

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:17.910
‎还有你...
And you...

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:19.750

‎我喜欢...
I love...

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.330
‎你的想象力

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.580
‎这房子里的每个人都很幸运...
And everyone in this house is so lucky...

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.580

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:48.450
‎只是答应我...
Just promise me...

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.870
‎如果你要保佑我们所有人的安全

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.450
‎首先要保证你自己的安全

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:55.750
‎不要到护墙上
And no going on the parapet.

‎我正要给你掖被子

‎弗洛拉的衣帽间里有一台电扇
There's an electric fan in Flora's cupboard.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000
‎好的
Okay.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.620
