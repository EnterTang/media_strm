

1
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,783
Tad? Is that you?

2
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,262
You're early.

3
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:53,201
<i>Time to kiss</i> <i>your sweet ass goodbye, cupcake.</i>

4
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,089
Seriously, several people told me that my scene...

5
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,654
is really the only one that's even remotely scary.

6
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,900
Becky, you make a major impact in this movie.

7
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:28,533
Somebody even said that Angelica's scene, it wasn't even scary at all.

8
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:32,339
Like, it was funny, and not in a good way.

9
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,837
We have to make sure you don't get pigeon-holed now...

10
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:39,248
which is why I think you shouldn't show your tits anymore.

11
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,887
What a piece of shit!

12
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,688
I know, it makes fucking <i>Blair Witch 2</i> look like <i>Titanic.</i>

13
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,493
It's just so fucking gratuitous!

14
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,925
I think that what makes this movie different...

15
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,833
is that the violence isn't so gratuitous.

16
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,934
It's more like the whole movie is about...

17
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,305
the whole psychological nature of fear.

18
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,239
I totally maxed out his Visa card paying for it.

19
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,805
Then somebody in Joe Roth's office saw it and said it was genius.

20
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,113
And now we have three meetings.

21
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,847
Seriously, you could write it. I've read your poetry and it's really good.

22
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,059
I think I should direct it, too.

23
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:24,256
Yeah, and we should have this really hot sex scene, all gritty and real.

24
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,698
You know, like, European.

25
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:31,329
I'm not showing my ass. My manager says I need to stop showing my ass.

26
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,153
You have a piece of toilet paper stuck to your shoe.

27
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,753
Shut up! Where?

28
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,960
- Honey, it's not working. - What?

29
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,429
No, no. It's not gonna happen for me.

30
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,212
It's not. It's not gonna happen for me.

31
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,476
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:56,082
- What's wrong? - Nothing. Don't take it personally.

33
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,721
Don't make this about me.

34
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,089
What? Am I not allowed to not have sex for once?

35
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,594
Is that what our relationship is now?

36
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,295
Wait a minute. You woke me up by going down on me.

37
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,609
I don't know what's wrong with me.

38
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,570
Maybe that car accident we had...

39
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,378
gave me some weird, Oliver-Sacks-blow-to-the-head disease.

40
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,118
Sorry. My whole life seems like a bad dream.

41
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,629
It's like somebody else's life.

42
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,993
Like, if my life were a movie, I'd fall asleep or I'd walk out.

43
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,338
- You still not seeing any clients? - I can't.

44
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,673
I can't face it.

45
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,912
You know...

46
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,991
sometimes you just got to force yourself to be active.

47
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,192
- When you're, you know... - Like what?

48
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,289
When you're what?

49
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,067
You think I'm depressed?

50
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,864
- Are you? - Yeah.

51
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,100
Doesn't mean I wanna talk about it.

52
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,239
Okay.

53
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,320
This is my sister-in-law, Angie.

54
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,756
- Angelica. - It's nice to meet you.

55
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,827
Likewise. And this is Brody Farrell.

56
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,264
- Are you the next of kin? - No.

57
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,562
Becky's parents died when she was two.

58
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,206
She was raised by her grandmother, who also died.

59
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,778
She didn't really have anybody, except us.

60
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:04,879
- I see. Can I ask who will be... - The cast of the movie.

61
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,576
We're all pitching in to pay for it.

62
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,221
We're going to need one person to be designated as the...

63
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,158
- Brody will do that. - Yeah.

64
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,992
She was sort of my girlfriend.

65
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,159
Do you know what kind of service you'd like?

66
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,363
Cheap.

67
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,737
We provide a variety of services for the more budget-conscious client.

68
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,708
- Sorry. Just let me turn this off. - Take it.

69
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,710
I can handle it.

70
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,082
Please excuse me.

71
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,691
- David Fisher. <i>- Hi, David. It's Kevin Miller.</i>

72
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,289
<i>You answered my personal ad</i> <i>in the</i> LA Weekly. <i>I'm the fireman.</i>

73
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,100
Yes, hi. Of course.

74
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,333
We can start with the most simple of traditional funerals...

75
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,337
which would include our American Eagle casket here.

76
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,502
I don't think we should bury her.

77
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,210
Becky was totally terrified of the dark.

78
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,379
We can still have a viewing...

79
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:21,354
during which the casket will never be closed, followed by a cremation.

80
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:26,831
That's good. And then we could scatter her ashes some place she really liked.

81
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,992
Like Griffith Park, or the Lava Lounge on La Brea.

82
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,366
I mean, I think we can skip the casket.

83
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,104
You sound like a really nice guy, too.

84
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,241
<i>I am a really nice guy. So, do you want</i> <i>to meet for coffee later this afternoon?</i>

85
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:49,482
This afternoon? Sure. I have something at 3:00, but I can meet you after that.

86
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,888
<i>Great, let's say at 4.00,</i> <i>at the Up All Night Coffee House.</i>

87
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,790
<i>I'll be wearing a red baseball cap.</i>

88
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,795
Great, I love red. It's one of my favorite colors...

89
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:01,195
- of which I have several. <i>- Okay, see you then.</i>

90
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,004
This is a beautiful and unusual cremains vessel.

91
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,837
The ashes actually fill these dolphins, which are carved out inside.

92
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,606
She wasn't really into dolphins.

93
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,780
I remember somebody suggesting she boycott tuna...

94
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,816
because of the whole dolphins-getting-caught-in-the-net thing.

95
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,354
And she said:

96
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,450
"Fuck dolphins. I want a Nicoise salad."

97
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,961
- What are these? - Those are keepsake miniature urns.

98
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,861
Sort of like lockets, if you will.

99
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,468
So everybody can get a piece of her.

100
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,942
Yes, it's an old custom from Thailand.

101
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,841
- Becky loved Thai food. - So what did I miss?

102
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,595
I'm sorry I'm late.

103
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,963
Why weren't you at school today?

104
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,699
I was in school today. I just wasn't in American History.

105
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,706
I mean, who needs to know that shit anyways, right?

106
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,811
Somebody who wants to have a concept of how the world works...

107
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,509
so they can have a fucking chance in life.

108
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,550
What crawled up your ass?

109
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,679
It's all lies anyways.

110
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,558
Where were you?

111
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,687
Andy and I skipped out after lunch. We went to the car museum.

112
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,128
Did you get high?

113
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,732
I'm 18 years old, living in fucking California. I'm not allowed to get high?

114
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,635
I'm worried about you, Gabe.

115
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,074
In case you don't remember, I have good reason to be.

116
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,646
I'm sorry, okay?

117
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,619
But you don't have to worry about me, I swear.

118
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,823
Just please don't lie to me.

119
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,128
I'm not.

120
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,503
I'm okay...

121
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,566
and I'm gonna stay okay...

122
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,509
as long as I have you.

123
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,299
<i>Let's take a look at your test results.</i>

124
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:56,805
Well, I have some very good news. You tested negative for the HIV antibody.

125
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,241
Thank God.

126
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,844
You need to be tested again in six months, just to be safe.

127
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:06,145
Let's see, negative for chlamydia, all hepatitises, syphilis.

128
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,287
Positive for gonorrhea.

129
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,047
- What? - Yeah.

130
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,257
Have you had any pain or difficulty urinating?

131
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,760
- No. - Any penile or anal discharge?

132
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,691
No.

133
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,731
Gonorrhea can be completely asymptomatic...

134
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,464
but if it's left untreated, it can lead to severe problems down the line.

135
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,065
I'm gonna give you some Cipro. It usually knocks it right out.

136
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,567
Well, this is certainly embarrassing.

137
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,771
Did you engage in unprotected sex?

138
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,307
Yes.

139
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,581
Bad boy.

140
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,496
- How was school? - Dull and depressing.

141
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,530
What are you reading?

142
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,434
<i>Now That You Know.</i>

143
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,842
Now that you know what?

144
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,370
That David is gay.

145
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,776
I take it you knew already.

146
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,355
How do you feel about it?

147
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,520
Are you hurt? Angry?

148
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,497
- Do you wish he wasn't gay? - No.

149
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,063
Those are all valid feelings, you know.

150
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,339
I don't care if he's gay, just as long as he's happy.

151
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,006
According to this book...

152
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,938
we should all be very open to how we feel...

153
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,614
and we should try to express those feelings...

154
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,446
because the foundation of intimacy is truth.

155
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:48,675
Okay.

156
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,086
Have you ever had any feelings of same-sex attraction?

157
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,586
What? No, Mom.

158
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,689
- It's nothing to be ashamed of. - I know.

159
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,432
When I was your age...

160
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,331
I actually had a little crush on Jane Fonda.

161
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,146
She's single again, so now's your chance.

162
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,046
I just never got into that whole promiscuous thing, you know.

163
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,556
First guy I had sex with...

164
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,562
I ended up in a relationship with for four years.

165
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:35,894
One-man kind of guy. Always have been. What about you?

166
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,000
Definitely.

167
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,104
Sex just for the sake of having sex, what is that?

168
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:46,042
Don't get me wrong. I love sex. I'm a very sexual being.

169
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:51,182
I just think it's better when there's something emotional going on behind it.

170
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,810
I credit my parents for that.

171
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,617
My mom and dad have been together for almost 40 years.

172
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,521
They're still hot for each other.

173
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,856
And they've never been anything but 100% supportive of me.

174
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,787
Wow.

175
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,971
I gotta get to work. Listen, it's been great meeting you.

176
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,783
This was fun. Would you like to do it again?

177
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,612
I don't think so.

178
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,253
You seem like a really nice guy, but I gotta be honest.

179
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,484
I didn't feel much of a spark.

180
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,462
Can't make it happen if it's not there, right?

181
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,838
It definitely looks like AVM.

182
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,107
Fuck.

183
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,514
So now what?

184
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,589
Well, that depends. Remind me what your symptoms have been.

185
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,850
- Headaches. - All the time?

186
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,128
No, just occasionally. Mostly on the left side of my head.

187
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:18,292
Any seizures? Impairment of vision? Sense of smell?

188
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,801
Once I had a flutter, just on the edge of my vision.

189
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,673
I'm as blind as a bat.

190
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,008
Once I woke up, I could see perfectly out of my left eye.

191
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,210
Lasted for a day and then it went away. Who knows what the hell that was?

192
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,179
So what next?

193
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,217
Well, let's see.

194
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,389
It's in a not overly-eloquent brain area.

195
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,265
- You left-handed? - No.

196
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,968
- That's not good. - Why not?

197
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,701
And it's a little larger than I'd like it to be.

198
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,744
Yeah, it's a little larger than I'd like it to be.

199
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,637
Okay.

200
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,347
You want options, I'll give you the big three:

201
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,611
Cranial surgery. Not a picnic.

202
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,454
Embolization.

203
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,889
Closing off the blood vessels by injecting glue into them.

204
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,952
Sometimes we use platinum coils instead.

205
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,125
And finally, radial surgery.

206
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,263
Focused radiation.

207
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,197
Die, you little motherfucker!

208
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,716
If I'd never been in a car accident and gotten a routine x-ray of my skull...

209
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,412
this would've never even come up, right?

210
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,253
Until something happened.

211
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:50,785
It's possible that I could go my entire life without it ever creating a problem.

212
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,762
- Anything's possible. - Do you think I need surgery?

213
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,334
I can't really say, without more tests.

214
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,996
I think you might benefit from embolization.

215
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,405
However, anytime you close off the large arteries going into an AVM...

216
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,377
the smaller blood vessels feeding it tend to increase in size.

217
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,215
Okay, so it doesn't really work.

218
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,921
- There's only so much we can do. - Oh, God!

219
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,152
Fuck! Fine. You know what? Just don't do anything, okay?

220
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:26,891
I'm going to put this all out of my head, no pun intended, and just get on with life.

221
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,125
I'm not sure...

222
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,931
I don't give a fuck what you think, you arrogant piece of shit.

223
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,040
Okay, even if we decide not to do anything at this juncture...

224
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,905
There's no "we." I decide.

225
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,638
I'd still like to get another MRI on you in 12 months.

226
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:43,510
And I'd like a fucking straight answer, asshole.

227
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,616
<i>It's kind of ironic.</i>

228
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:50,549
You don't smoke, you run every day, eat all that healthy crap.

229
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,917
Shut up!

230
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,291
Now me, I smoked, I drank, I ate any old thing I wanted.

231
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,122
And I inhaled embalming fluid for God knows how long. You know what?

232
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,363
If it wasn't for that bus, I'd have lived to be 93.

233
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:10,473
It's the first time I've driven since then. You may want to fasten your seatbelt.

234
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,445
Well, who's the dead man in this car? It's not me!

235
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,111
Fuck you!

236
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,887
<i>We thank you, Heavenly Father...</i>

237
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,720
for this and all thy blessings in Christ's name. Amen.

238
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,918
Amen.

239
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:41,724
I've invited Nikolai to dinner Sunday night. I'd like you all to be there.

240
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,234
Nikolai the flower guy?

241
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,936
Yes, he and I are having a sexual relationship now.

242
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,076
I'm not sure if it's something that's going to last, but there it is.

243
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:58,879
We're all adults. We're all sexual beings. We should acknowledge that.

244
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,915
Okay.

245
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:11,020
Nate, I'd like you to invite Brenda. Claire, I'd like you to invite Gabriel Dimas.

246
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:16,134
And, David, if you have a special friend, I'd like for him to come, as well.

247
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,304
Why is my friend special?

248
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:24,308
All right. If you're having sex with anyone, I'd like to meet him. Is that better?

249
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,741
Not really.

250
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,605
Stop acting like children!

251
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,711
- Where are you going? - I'm just getting an aspirin.

252
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,415
Do you have a headache?

253
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,948
No, I read you should take an aspirin a day. It keeps the blood thin.

254
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,894
Please, if our blood were any thinner, we'd evaporate.

255
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:49,161
What's that supposed to mean? Is that some sort of insult? We're thin-blooded?

256
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:53,227
Mom, no, it was a joke. I'm more thin-blooded than any of us, probably.

257
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,139
Are you seeing anyone?

258
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,900
No.

259
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,573
Why not?

260
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,914
Sex is an important and healthy part of life. It's nothing to be ashamed of.

261
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,613
Yes, I know that. Unfortunately, I'm not having any right now.

262
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,415
What happened to that cop...

263
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,514
the black man?

264
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,457
He met someone else.

265
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,071
Thank you.

266
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,840
You don't have any free time tomorrow?

267
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,978
<i>- I don't think so.</i> - I'd really like to see you.

268
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,481
<i>I have three shiatsu appointments.</i>

269
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,612
You're the one that wanted me to get on with my life.

270
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,853
<i>You can still come Sunday night</i> <i>for dinner, right?</i>

271
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:51,622
Even if just for the entertainment value. It's bound to be a freak fest.

272
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,623
<i>I think so. Maybe.</i>

273
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,692
- I miss you. - You just saw me.

274
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,867
<i>I know, I just...</i>

275
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,399
would really like to be with you at this moment in time.

276
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,379
- Right now. <i>- I'll see you soon.</i>

277
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,915
Sunday, okay?

278
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,316
I love you.

279
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,343
I love you, too.

280
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,911
- Hey, Rico. - Hey, boss man. I've got a favor to ask you.

281
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,044
Okay.

282
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,953
Could you please drop her off at the crematorium for me tonight?

283
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,691
Come on, man. Vanessa's just a bit overwhelmed at home.

284
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,821
Julio's got a cold and Augusto hasn't slept through the night for a month.

285
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,902
No, I can't.

286
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,334
I'm sorry, Rico, but I can't.

287
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,172
Okay.

288
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,742
Can you at least help me put her inside the box?

289
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:23,913
Sure.

290
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,595
So, cardboard box? Classy.

291
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:37,662
She obviously didn't think her life was worth anything, so it makes sense to me.

292
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,437
On three. One, two, three.

293
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,535
It's kind of sad.

294
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,610
It's not.

295
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:53,181
She threw her fucking life away. It's not sad. It's pathetic.

296
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:12,336
We tend to forget how many gifts God has given each and every one of us...

297
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:16,136
because our lives are so filled with distractions...

298
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:19,741
crowded with messages competing for our attention...

299
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:22,745
encouraging us to be unhappy with our lives.

300
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,642
If only we looked younger...

301
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,880
had perfect skin...

302
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,511
zero body fat.

303
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:36,223
The truth of the matter is God loves us just the way we are.

304
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,794
Some people said, "Congratulations. You've really shaken things up." Whatever.

305
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:46,303
Most people in the congregation wouldn't even make eye contact with me after that.

306
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,071
So now I'm back at St. Stephen's.

307
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,311
So, how are you guys?

308
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:02,417
- Good. We're good. - Just got back from a weekend in San Diego.

309
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,988
- Spectacular. - We went parasailing.

310
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,882
Keith won't admit it, but he was scared to death.

311
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,354
I was not scared. Might have had a little rush of adrenaline...

312
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,556
but that's the point, right?

313
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,958
I'll have him hang-gliding by the end of the year, if it kills me.

314
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:21,870
In your dreams, fool! I am not breaking every bone in my body just to impress you.

315
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:25,372
Seven years I've been hang-gliding. I never broke anything.

316
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,173
- You're just lucky. - Don't I know it?

317
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:35,718
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i> <i>only one of these men will be crowned...</i>

318
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,085
<i>Mr. Gay Black America!</i>

319
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,690
Did I tell you I'm moving?

320
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,197
- Where? - Same building. A bigger place opened up.

321
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,637
We've been wanting to get a dog.

322
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,804
Great.

323
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,749
Do I seem more tense than usual?

324
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,819
You're not supposed to talk, remember? It takes us both out of it.

325
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:17,218
The only conversation is between your body and my hands.

326
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,963
Correct me if I'm wrong, but we're on my dime here.

327
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:29,840
I discovered one of the worst things about selling 3 million books...

328
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:34,472
is constantly feeling like I have to apologize for it, you know?

329
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,544
It's like, "I make a ton of money, so I must be part of the problem."

330
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,748
- Yes. - Yes, what?

331
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,182
You do seem more tense than usual.

332
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:49,488
I'm not responsible for cancer. I'm not responsible for world hunger.

333
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:53,893
What if I'm just happy, and that's my contribution to the world?

334
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,364
I'm thinking of pitching a book to my publisher.

335
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:04,101
Bit of a cultural history, tracing the how, and the why, and when...

336
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,438
- it became such a sin to be happy. - Drop.

337
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:10,776
Who knows, it might help some of those poor sad fucks...

338
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,477
who are incapable of experiencing joy.

339
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,822
- Get out of my house. - Excuse me?

340
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:22,423
- Get the fuck out of my house. - What is wrong with you?

341
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,860
You don't have any respect for me or what I do.

342
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,057
I'm just another servant who has to listen to your bullshit...

343
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:32,297
and pretend like I don't think you're the stupid asshole windbag that you are.

344
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,564
You crazy bitch.

345
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:38,436
I'm paying you for a shiatsu, and I intend to get a shiatsu.

346
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,477
I don't need your fucking money.

347
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,879
I do not allow people to treat me like this.

348
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:55,220
Yeah? Well, if you don't get out of my fucking house right now...

349
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:59,491
I'll call the <i>LA Times</i> and I'll tell them about the lipo scars on your ass.

350
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,232
Right now.

351
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,731
Get out!

352
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,484
<i>So this is where the magic happens.</i>

353
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,719
Yeah, this is it.

354
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,965
What's that smell? It's like...

355
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,626
Disinfectant, burnt coffee, embalming fluid.

356
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:49,445
"For the velvety look and feel of actual living tissue."

357
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:54,547
- No fucking way! - You do not even want to know.

358
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:58,520
They have these plastic screws, only bigger...

359
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,349
that they stick into people's orifices, so stuff won't spill out.

360
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,692
- That's some kind of fucked up. - Welcome to my world.

361
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,772
So this is where my brother was?

362
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,501
Jesus, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought you down here.

363
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,515
I'm the one who asked to see it.

364
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,224
What?

365
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:45,162
You're the first guy I've ever brought home to meet my family...

366
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,667
and I feel weird, you know? I feel nervous.

367
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,040
Don't worry. I will be on my best behavior.

368
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,104
Okay? Come on.

369
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,859
Your mother is a good woman.

370
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,903
- Yes, we're aware of that. - David, give him a break.

371
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,469
Sorry, you'll have to excuse my brother.

372
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,874
He's been majorly cranky ever since he stopped getting laid.

373
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,117
- How old you are? - Thirty-one.

374
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,613
Good.

375
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,761
I had a son.

376
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,090
He would be a little bit older than you.

377
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,395
He was a student of medicine.

378
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,810
- Look who's here. - Hello.

379
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,596
I've got major cotton mouth.

380
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:33,074
- Who wants to say grace? - I will say grace.

381
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,806
"The poor shall eat, and be filled.

382
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:42,109
"And those that seek the Lord shall praise him.

383
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,782
"Their hearts will live forever and ever.

384
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:53,061
"Glory be to the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit...

385
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,459
"both now and forever...

386
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,602
"and unto the ages of ages.

387
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,399
"Amen.

388
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,006
"Lord have mercy.

389
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,484
"Lord, bless.

390
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,952
"O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God...

391
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:25,219
"for the sake of the prayers of thy most pure mother and all the saints...

392
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,491
"have mercy on us.

393
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:29,992
"Amen."

394
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,871
Nikolai, you are so beautiful.

395
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,274
Thank you.

396
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,911
You're such a beautiful person. There is this total light coming out of you.

397
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:55,617
That's a very unusual compliment, Nate.

398
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,923
- Your brother is high. - I know, look at his eyes.

399
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:09,094
- Are you all right? - I am more than all right.

400
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,141
I haven't felt this good in... I don't even know how long it's been.

401
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,474
Yes.

402
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,282
You know how long it's been since I've heard you do that?

403
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:28,917
Remember when we were first going out, you used to laugh all the time.

404
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,518
I miss that. Your laughter's like music.

405
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,097
- Nate. - What?

406
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,258
You're high.

407
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,635
No, I'm not.

408
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,167
Am I?

409
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,672
Look at the light.

410
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,244
Oh, my God, I am high.

411
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,451
I love the little...

412
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,619
They're like halos.

413
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,059
What is he high on?

414
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,357
I wouldn't know.

415
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,131
I am so not hungry.

416
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,569
I think this went pretty good tonight.

417
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,077
What are you talking about?

418
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,911
- It was awkward and embarrassing. - What?

419
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,850
I mean, my son is high on drugs!

420
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:34,788
What am I supposed to do about that? Should I intervene? Join a support group?

421
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,617
He just seems happy.

422
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,731
We're going to the movies.

423
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,063
Good night, Mrs. Fisher. Thank you for dinner.

424
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,502
What movie?

425
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,507
We haven't decided yet, but we'll be back late.

426
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,737
Mom, you said yourself, we're all adults.

427
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,738
We'll be back late.

428
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,247
Good night.

429
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,189
It's all about flowing.

430
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,929
It flows up, it flows down.

431
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,125
And then, sometimes, things stop it from flowing. You stay.

432
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,159
It's like you just move in a little pool.

433
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,330
You're like a little eddy.

434
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,408
And that's what it all comes down to.

435
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:33,681
Everything in my life, every thing...

436
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,549
You know, this thing in my head...

437
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,112
it's all about flow.

438
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,586
Flow?

439
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,696
Oh, my God!

440
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:59,404
That was so totally you! That was just so totally David!

441
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,145
I love you.

442
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:07,206
- Okay, I'm out of here. - No, you have to take him with you.

443
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,947
Hope I did nothing to fuck you up when we were kids.

444
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,784
Not when he's like this.

445
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,685
Did you know I taught David how to masturbate?

446
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,895
No, I didn't, and you know what, Nate? That's fascinating, but I have to go.

447
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,694
No, just wait a second. I just want to say goodbye. Come here.

448
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,124
Oh, God!

449
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:30,906
- I love you so fucking much. - You're so fucking high.

450
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,042
But how'd I get that way? You can't just get high out of nowhere.

451
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:38,445
- You have to take drugs. I didn't take any. - Did you take any aspirin?

452
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,742
Yeah.

453
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,878
There may have been a stray tab of Ecstasy...

454
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,615
in the aspirin bottle in the kitchen cabinet.

455
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,489
Oh, dear. You call me when you crash.

456
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:57,832
No, call me after you crash. You know what? Call me next week.

457
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,275
I hope you like her.

458
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,375
- It's important to me that you like her. - I do like her.

459
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,214
'Cause you're the only brother I have.

460
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:23,885
<i>Time to kiss</i> <i>your sweet ass goodbye, cupcake.</i>

461
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,856
Yeah, slice her up!

462
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,259
That was hostile.

463
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,564
Isn't that the girl that you guys are burying?

464
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:37,101
- She's hot. - She's hot and dead.

465
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,078
<i>This calls for someone with experience.</i>

466
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,341
<i>Someone who knows her way</i> <i>around Griffith Park.</i>

467
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,815
<i>- That's me.</i> <i>- In the daytime.</i>

468
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,813
<i>You gotta love her.</i>

469
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,653
<i>In fact, if God gave me the ingredients</i> <i>and told me to make a woman...</i>

470
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,388
<i>I'd make her just like my wife.</i>

471
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:04,998
<i>They lost no time in tucking into</i> <i>the wonderful meal Boris had prepared.</i>

472
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,662
<i>And then there was a dessert.</i>

473
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:12,038
<i>I guess Boris knows I always like to have</i> <i>lettuce for dessert, don't you, Boris?</i>

474
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,942
<i>I hope the meal was satisfactory.</i>

475
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,448
<i>It was delightful, Boris!</i> <i>You're a wonderful cook.</i>

476
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,718
<i>It was nothing, Martha.</i> <i>Straight out of the cookbook.</i>

477
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,754
<i>It's yummy, Boris.</i> <i>I couldn't eat another thing.</i>

478
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:31,717
<i>Yeah, it's not bad for a first effort.</i>

479
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,690
Fuck.

480
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,277
Buddy boy!

481
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:35,252
Come on, saved a place for you.

482
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,425
Chinese checkers.

483
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,767
- I always hated this game. - That's because you never played for money.

484
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,837
Nate, I want you to meet a couple of friends of mine.

485
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,112
Well, honey, this is the man.

486
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:01,544
Death.

487
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,012
The Grim Reaper.

488
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:06,917
Cigar?

489
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:11,693
- No, thanks. - Good for you, baby. That stuff is nasty.

490
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,922
- And this is... - My partner.

491
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,397
That sounds so professional. I love it.

492
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,364
- Life. - Shut up.

493
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,703
Oh, yeah, it's a whole yin-yang thing.

494
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,574
You telling me you two are in business together?

495
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,877
Honey, me and him are in all kinds of shit together!

496
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:36,045
Let's just say it's a mutually beneficial arrangement.

497
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,711
It's your turn.

498
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,319
Shouldn't I wait for you to start a new game?

499
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,726
This game ain't never gonna end.

500
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,932
You're either in the game, or you're out of it.

501
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:53,136
"On or off the bus," if you prefer.

502
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:55,861
All right, I'm in.

503
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,872
You gotta put something in the kitty, son.

504
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,677
- What are you betting? - Everything.

505
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:08,045
All right, I'll bet everything. Whatever.

506
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,929
- I'm shaking. - Hey, buddy boy, no.

507
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,467
You don't wanna get this guy mad, believe me.

508
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,629
I don't get mad. I have people who do it for me.

509
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,106
Showoff!

510
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:42,018
But that always gets me going.

511
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:46,286
You wanna fuck me, puppet head?

512
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,060
Momma!

513
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,531
Yeah, baby! That's it.

514
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:07,001
Go to town, big daddy!

515
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:18,287
Big cosmic mystery. Right here, right in front of you.

516
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:22,854
You can't say your old man never took you any place interesting.

517
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,254
Yeah, but I'm high.

518
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,196
I know I'm high.

519
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,995
"All that lives, lives forever.

520
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,075
"Only the shell, the perishable passes away."

521
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,303

00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:44,574

00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,618
<i>Now take this over here and...</i>

525
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,887
<i>Look at that, folks.</i> <i>Look at that for a holiday dinner.</i>

526
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:04,495
<i>If we had some mint jelly,</i> <i>that would be fabulous.</i>

527
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,263
<i>- Unbelievable!</i> <i>- Smell that.</i>

528
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,128
<i>So all I get to do is smell it?</i>

529
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,075
<i>- Show them.</i> <i>- Smell this.</i>

530
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,843
<i>- Isn't that wonderful?</i> <i>- Oh, boy!</i>

531
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,959
<i>- Hello?</i> - Oh, no, did I wake you?

532
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,658
Yeah, you did. What's up?

533
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:41,003
I just wanted to thank you for inviting me out...

534
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,438
- with you and Eddie yesterday after church. - Okay.

535
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,172
<i>And to tell you that...</i>

536
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:50,574
it's really important to me that we've remained friends.

537
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:57,150
If you'd ever like to do something, just the two of us, I'd really like that.

538
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,624
Look, David, I'm happy that we're friends...

539
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:05,188
but I'm in a relationship. A good one.

540
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:10,656
- I know. - You and me, it ain't happening.

541
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:16,338
Yeah, I know that. It's just kind of hard for me to be around you and Eddie together.

542
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,370
You need to get over that.

543
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:22,170
Jesus, Keith, could you be a little more self-righteous?

544
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,483
- Good morning, Mom. - You're up early.

545
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:41,227
I've been having trouble sleeping recently. Not sure why.

546
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,400
Where's Nikolai?

547
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,475
- Home. - He didn't stay over?

548
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,004
Of course not.

549
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,775
You know, Mom...

550
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:06,848
if you did want for him to stay over, that would be your right.

551
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:11,658
- I know that. I don't need your permission. - No, you don't. Nor do I need yours.

552
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,755
Of course not.

553
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:22,205
You had a terrible time last night, didn't you?

554
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,271
Kind of.

555
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:32,805
I did it for you. Arranged the whole evening.

556
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,575
- Why? - Some stupid book told me to.

557
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:38,143
- Throw that book away. - I intend to.

558
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:45,358
Does Nate have a problem with drugs now? Is this something I need to know about?

559
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,653
I think he took it by accident.

560
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:50,666
How can something like that be an accident?

561
00:47:55,973 --> 00:48:00,000
Rebecca Milford's star shone all too briefly.

562
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,870
But, oh, how brightly it shone.

563
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,679
This is really boring.

564
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:09,081
How very, very brightly indeed.

565
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,454
No, it's hilarious, is what it is.

566
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,418
Gabe, a girl died.

567
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,154
So what? Everybody dies.

568
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:31,573
How did Ecstasy get in the aspirin bottle? Is that Claire's idea of a joke?

569
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,737
I think I might have left it in there.

570
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:41,245
- Where did you get it? - You remember the square-dancing guy?

571
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,917
Do you think you could get some more?

572
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,599
I wrote something about Becky...

573
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:02,202
that I'd like to share with everyone here.

574

Right on. That's my man.

584
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,231
What are you doing down here?

585
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,299
It was a stupid idea of me to go to a funeral for fun.

586
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,246
Yeah, I tried to tell you that.

587
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,175
- Okay, so you were right. - Are you okay?

588
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,483
I'm fine. Why do you have to...

589
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:29,517
- I'm not a pet! I'm not your pet! - I'm sorry.

590
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,884
I'm going home.

591
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,293
You said you guys were all pitching in together to pay for this.

592
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,304
Yeah, I paid my $600, and I'm not paying a penny more.

593
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,431
Do you know how rude that girl was to me?

594
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,635
You know how this is gonna make me look?

595
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,976
So? Go talk to Brody. He's the one who supposedly can't come up with his share.

596
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,446
- You brought this funeral here. - So?

597
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:56,714
So maybe you need to come up with the difference.

598
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,148
Maybe you need to get off my case...

599
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:04,250
considering I just gave your wife $500 so she can pay for fucking diapers!

600
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,729
- What are you talking about? - You heard me.

601
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,862
- What the fuck are you talking about? - She asked me for it.

602
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,351
What are you doing?

603
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,828
This way, she'll always be a part of us.

- Who the hell are you? - Fucking bunch of junkies!

608
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,544
- This is not cool. - Did you see what these people are doing?

609
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,278
I know, but this is our business, these are our clients.

- I don't think so. - Don't you remember? I went on and on...

620
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:45,320
about the Peter Brook production of <i>The Mahabharata</i> in London?

621
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:54,804
But it felt so profound. Are you telling me it's just recycled crap from my brain?

<i>I'm looking at your name, plain as day.</i> <i>"Nathaniel Samuel Fisher, Jr."</i>

630
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,510
You know, I had totally forgotten about that.

631
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,583
I'm proud of you, Nate.

632
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:44,480
Thanks.

633
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:48,085
I'll see you later.

634
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:54,221
- Where are you going? - I have a client at 8:30.

635
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,765
- That's a little late, isn't it? - No, it's not that late.

636
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,135
Can I come over later?

637
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,468
Not tonight, okay?

638
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:12,679
I'm having enough trouble just being with myself right now.

639
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,441
I'm sorry. It's not you.

640
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,588
It's me. I'm fucked up.

641
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,257
And you can't fix it.

642
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:56,217
You're in the game now, buddy boy...

643
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,347
whether you like it or not.
