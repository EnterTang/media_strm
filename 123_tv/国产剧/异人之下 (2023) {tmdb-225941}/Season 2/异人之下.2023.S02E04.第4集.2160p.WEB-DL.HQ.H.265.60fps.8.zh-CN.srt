
1
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,173
<i>Pike Place Market was born in 1907...</i>

2
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,041
<i>from citizen outrage</i> <i>at the high cost of produce...</i>

3
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,707
<i>when Seattle City Councilman</i> <i>Thomas Revelle...</i>

4
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,182
<i>proposed a public street market.</i>

5
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:02,081
<i>On opening day, August 7, 1907...</i>

6
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,955
<i>eight farmers brought their wagons</i> <i>to the corner of 1st and Pike...</i>

7
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,893
<i>and were overwhelmed</i> <i>by an estimated 10,000 eager shoppers.</i>

8
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,998
<i>By 11.00 a.m. They were completely sold out.</i>

9
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,235
<i>That concludes the morning half of our tour.</i>

10
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,396
<i>Once again, my name's Karen.</i>

11
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,804
<i>You've been a superduper group</i> <i>this morning.</i>

12
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,742
<i>We'll see you back here on the bus at 1.30.</i>

13
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,275
Thank you, Karen.

14
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,412
I don't know about you, but I could sure use a fucking cigarette.

15
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,383
Come on, dear.

16
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,581
Bye.

17
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,985
Excuse me, sir?

18
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,694
<i>Sir, it's lunchtime.</i>

19
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,293
<i>You can get off the bus now.</i> <i>We're at Pike Place Market.</i>

20
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:01,805
Shit!

21
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,950
We've got another dead one back here, Larry.

22
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,699
You missed your last three sessions.

23
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:27,306
Sometimes coming in here talking about my life gets in the way of me having one.

24
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,808
So why did you bother coming in today?

25
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:35,746
Because they sent a letter to my mother and threatened to suspend me if I didn't.

26
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,376
I thought you had something you wanted to talk about.

27
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,317
With you? Yeah, right.

28
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,914
Are you angry with me?

29
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,586
How can you tell?

30
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:53,159
I was obligated to cooperate with the police, Claire. It's my job.

31
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,425
Just so you know, I was here for you, not for them.

32
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,766
They wanted to interrogate you alone.

33
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,496
And they haven't found him yet, in case you're curious.

34
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,867
I'm not.

35
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,838
You haven't heard from him?

36
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,679
Fuck, no. Not that I'd tell you if I had.

37
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,719
You did the right thing when you called the police that night.

38
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,414
I know I did the right thing.

39
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,980
This isn't about whether or not I did the right thing.

40
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,458
Given the circumstances, it's fully understandable...

41
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,688
that you're feeling this angry, Claire.

42
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,494
If you don't stop saying my name at the end of every sentence, I am gonna...

43
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,558
- What? - I don't know.

44
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,202
Just don't, okay?

45
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,539
You feel like throwing something?

46
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,480
Excuse me?

47
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,981
You could, you know.

48
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,612
Just pick something up off my desk and chuck it.

49
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,617
I'm so sure you'd let me trash something off your desk.

50
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,955
If you thought it might help, I would.

51
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,770
No, thanks.

52
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,509
You're angry with Gabe...

53
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,975
and you're scared because you don't know what's gonna happen to him.

54
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,448
At this point, I don't give a flying fuck about him.

55
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,986
You don't really feel that way, do you?

56
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,749
No.

57
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,805
I do feel better. Thank you.

58
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,847
He was on one of those package bus tours.

59
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,653
He'd been going on a lot.

60
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,384
Three or four times a year, ever since Mom died.

61
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,451
Sometimes he went with his friend Pete. This time he went alone.

62
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,856
They think his heart just gave out.

63
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,057
I'm very sorry.

64
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:14,366
- Where is your father now? - He's still up there in Seattle.

65
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:20,403
The Columbia Funeral Home's holding him for us. They're on Rainier Avenue.

66
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:24,878
Not a problem. We can make arrangements to have him flown back to LA.

67
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,448
- Flown back? - Yes.

68
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,314
Dad won't fly.

69
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,555
It was always a sore spot with Mom.

70
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,794
She wanted to travel, but Dad flat out refused.

71
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:42,563
Then, after she died, he started taking all these package bus tours.

72
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,897
He has...

73
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,734
- He had a thing about flying. - He never flew.

74
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:53,437
- I'm sure, given the circumstances... - No, it isn't what he would have wanted.

75
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,572
Isn't there some other way?

76
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:01,017
We can make arrangements to have him shipped via rail or freight.

77
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,121
Like FedEx?

78
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,225
- You can do that? - It's done all the time.

79
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:11,219
They brought Abraham Lincoln home to Illinois by train...

80
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,788
all the way from Washington, packed in ice.

81
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,264
It shouldn't be a problem.

82
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:28,643
Keith, I'll be back up here just as soon as your father's back on his feet.

83
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,511
What if Grandpa dies?

84
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:35,112
My friend Neisha's brother had an operation, and he died.

85
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:40,021
I told you, Taylor, it's just a hernia. It's nothing for you to worry about.

86
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,358
I'd sure like to know where the hell Karla is.

87
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,057
Is she still up in Oakland with Derek?

88
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,968
Did she even offer to come back down here...

89
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,733
and take care of her kid when you told her you were leaving?

90
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,569
We haven't heard from her.

91
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,805
Jesus.

92
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,673
I thought you had a number for her.

93
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,118
- It's been disconnected. - Shit.

94
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,421
I told you, Keith, hush that kind of mouth around your niece.

95
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,349
Maybe I should just take the child with me.

96
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,494
She'll be fine, all right?

97
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,395
My new place has an extra room, and between Eddie and me...

98
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,263
- we'll make sure she's... - I don't wanna come stay with you.

99
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,634
- How come you can't stay here? - Because my things are at my place.

100
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,538
- What about my stuff? - You can bring it with you.

101
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,603
You'd probably steal it.

102
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,301
There's my cab.

103
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,112
Taylor, come on, honey. Give your grandma a hug.

104
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,785
I love you, Grandma.

105
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:49,085
Now, you be good, and you mind your Uncle Keith.

106
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,926
I'll try to come back as fast as I can.

107
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,874
I know a lot worser words than "shit," you know.

108
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,013
So do I.

109
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,155
So, how'd the Mossback intake go?

110
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,058
We need to find a way to get a body shipped back from your old stomping ground.

111
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,291
Why can't you just fly it back? That's what your father always did.

112
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,491
Apparently the deceased was afraid of flying.

113
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,229
I don't think he's gonna give a shit now.

114
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,635
The family doesn't want him to fly, all right?

115
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,037
The freight companies are backed up until next week.

116
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,201
And Amtrak can't bring him back until next Tuesday.

117
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,938
No problem.

118
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,379
I'll fly up, rent a refrigerated van, and drive him back.

119
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,416
You don't need a refrigerated van, just a one-way rental.

120
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,953
- He's already been embalmed. - Even easier.

121
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:53,088
You'd do that? You'd fly up there and turn around and drive all the way back?

122
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,026
I haven't been back since Christmas. I can see a few friends.

123
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,995
I still have stuff up there. I'd love to.

124
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,363
I suppose we could mark up the cost of shipping to cover your travel.

125
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,664
- When do you want me to leave? - Tomorrow?

126
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:04,828
Done.

127
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,409
Have you met any nice men recently, David?

128
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,744
No one to speak of.

129
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,610
I wish you'd put yourself out more.

130
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,985
The door to your house only opens from the inside, you know.

131
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:30,318
We haven't seen your friend Gabriel around much lately, Claire.

132
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,585
So?

133
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,159
Have you not been seeing as much of him?

134
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,327
- No, I haven't. - Did you two have a falling-out?

135
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,436
Yeah, Gabe joined the Hare Krishna, okay?

136
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,771
Those people with the orange robes and tambourines?

137
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:47,244
That try to sell you books in the airport. Yeah, that's them.

138
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,541
Oh, my goodness!

139
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,951
- He never struck me as a religious person. - He is now, big-time.

140
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,414
- Did he shave his head? - Yeah, he shaved his head.

141
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,289
Can we talk about something else, please?

142
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,529
Claire, do you want to come to Seattle with me?

143
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,831
You're asking me to come to Seattle with you?

144
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,392
Yeah, why not?

145
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,673
I'm not sure we can stick the Mossbacks with two plane tickets.

146
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,605
- I'll pay for it. - You will?

147
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,769
Yeah. I could use the company.

148
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,870
- You could help me drive on the way back. - She'll miss school.

149
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,178
We're not doing anything I can't miss, and I can bring my homework.

150
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,219
It's just for a couple of days.

151
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:30,680
Fine.

152
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,359
I'm tired of trying to be the architect for this family.

153
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,328
It's high time you drew your own blueprints.

154
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,934
Does anyone know what the fuck she's talking about anymore?

155
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,505
- Nate. - What?

156
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,215
By the way, I'm flying up to Seattle tomorrow.

157
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,848
- You are? - Yeah.

158
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,962
I'm picking up a body and driving it back for David.

159
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,124
- I'm gonna take Claire with me. - Sounds like fun.

160
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,069
You don't mind that I didn't ask you?

161
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,401
- Ask me what? - To go with me.

162
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,876
- No, not at all. - Good.

163
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:28,936
You sure?

164
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,806
Nate, I'm trying to read...

165
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,853
and you know I hate it when you floss in front of me.

166
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,983
Sorry.

167
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,990
Is it weird I didn't ask you to come to Seattle with me?

168
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,156
No, why would it be?

169
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,465
I don't know. It just feels a little weird.

170
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,366
Okay, now it is a little weird.

171
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,201
But only because you're making it a little weird.

172
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,071
- But you're not mad about it? - Not at all.

173
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,608
I think it's really good for you, spending some time with your sister.

174
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,442
That's what I think.

175
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,928
- You sure it's not too weird? - God, Nate, give it a rest.

176
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,961
- Good night, Bren. - Good night.

177
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,832
Cool! Sleater-Kinney's playing at this place called Showbox tonight.

178
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,336
I hate to break it to you, but Showbox is 18 and over.

179
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,331
What makes you think I don't have a fake I.D.?

180
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,406
You have a fake I.D.?

181
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:08,013
You're not gonna pull some pseudo-parental bullshit on me, are you?

182
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,947
No. I had a fake I.D. Once, too.

183
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,984
Maybe I'll go with you.

184
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,587
- I don't need a babysitter, Nate. - I love Sleater-Kinney.

185
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,991
You love Sleater-Kinney?

186
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:27,095
Will you try to get over yourself for a second and let me be your friend and your brother?

187
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,672
Did you bring me on this trip because you thought I needed a little distraction?

188
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,642
I invited you because I thought it'd be fun to bring you along.

189
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,009
Now I'm having second thoughts.

190
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,040
I believe you.

191
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,913
- So where are we staying, anyway? - My friend Lisa's.

192
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,290
- Is she an old girlfriend? - No.

193
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,362
No way, not even close.

194
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,597
We were strictly roommates, nothing more.

195
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,301
Worked at the co-op together.

196
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,899
Is she all crunchy-granola...

197
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,669
backpacky, and way into grunge?

198
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,146
Crunchy-granola: Maybe a little.

199
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,943
Backpacky: Definitely.

200
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,008
Into grunge: No way.

201
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,780
Grunge died long before Kurt Cobain did.

202
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,717
Besides, Lisa is...

203
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,086
It's not too easy to categorize.

204
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,489
You guys did it a few times, though, right?

205
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,930
- We're not having this discussion. - Fine.

206
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,977
This is it.

207
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,248
Sweet.

208
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,231
- It's so good to have you back home. - It's good to be back.

209
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,361
Lisa, this is my sister, Claire.

210
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,307
Come in.

211
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,531
Hello, Hiram? It's me, Ruth.

212
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,969
I'm fine. How are you?

213
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,669
Listen, the reason why I'm calling is...

214
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,849
I just wanted to let you know that I've been drafting a new blueprint for myself.

215
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,717
No, not for the house.

216
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,386
Yes, it is for the house. My house.

217
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,155
I mean, not the actual physical structure I live in with my family.

218
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,322
I'm speaking more of the emotional structure...

219
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,866
in which I've chosen to live my life.

220
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,738
I most certainly have not been drinking.

221
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,473
I'm just trying to let you know, Hiram...

222
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,543
that I harbor no hard feelings against you.

223
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,443
No, I do not want to get back together.

224
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,310
How presumptuous!

225
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,184
You know something, Hiram? Fuck off!

226
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,161
Amelia? It's Ruth.

227
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,823
I know we haven't seen each other in a while...

228
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,028
and I feel a little funny leaving this on your machine...

229
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,504
but I just wanted to let you know...

230
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,733
I've been drafting a new blueprint for myself.

231
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:35,172
And if you're ever looking for an opportunity to renew our friendship...

232
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,477
my front door is open to you.

233
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,907
That's all I wanted to say.

234
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,818
You can call me back if you want to, okay?

235
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:43,979
Bye!

236
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,690
Sarah, are you there?

237
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,455
If you're there, pick up.

238
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,536
Okay, fine. I know we don't talk to each other very much anymore...

239
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,836
but I left you three messages in two weeks and you haven't returned any of my calls.

240
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,605
I think you don't ever want to talk to me again, and if that's the case...

241
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,873
we really need to talk!

242
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:13,514
There are things I'd like to say to you about the cracks in my foundation...

243
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,315
and your part in helping me repair them.

244
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,046
This is your sister, Ruth.

245
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,702
What do you mean, you can't?

246
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,866
Eddie, I need you to pick up Taylor from school.

247
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,876
Look, I realize you're in the middle of a shift.

248
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,641
Can't you get somebody to cover for you?

249
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,815
I'm caught between a rock and a fucking hard place here.

250
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,079
I need you to do this for me.

251
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,316
All right, never mind. Fuck it, then.

252
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,789
This is a bullshit detail.

253
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,383
I wish the guy would just shoot her and get it over with.

254
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,894
I've got tickets for the Dodgers tonight.

255
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,854
What did I say?

256
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,869
Listen, I've got a huge favor to ask.

257
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,778
What is it?

258
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,777
I'm stuck in Koreatown.

259
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,409
Some guy's holding his mother-in-law hostage.

260
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:23,249
He claims she put his TV remote down a garbage disposal.

261
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,655
<i>I don't know when I'll be out of here.</i> <i>Eddie's pulling a double shift.</i>

262
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,484
I hate to ask...

263
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,695
but is there any way that you can pick up Taylor...

264
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,231
from Bridgebrook Elementary at 3:00?

265
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,665
Yes. I mean, sure. I'd be glad to.

266
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,330
<i>- You sure?</i> - Yes, of course.

267
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,901
All right, thanks.

268
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,506
<i>I'll call ahead to the school</i> <i>so they'll be expecting you.</i>

269
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,212
<i>- I'll pick Taylor up from your place later.</i> - Great.

270
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,744
Thanks, man. I owe you one.

271
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,416
No problem.

272
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,297
- What is this? - Tofu meatloaf.

273
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,137
It's completely vegan.

274
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,175
No dairy, no eggs. No animal products of any kind.

275
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,444
- No meat? - None whatsoever.

276
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,515
Why do you call it "meatloaf"?

277
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,917
You're a pisser just like your brother, aren't you?

278
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:32,452
- Anyway, it used to be his favorite. - It's delicious, Lisa.

279
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,055
I didn't put in too much garlic?

280
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,096
- Not for me. - No way.

281
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,227
Garlic is a miracle herb.

282
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,563
It lowers cholesterol and blood pressure.

283
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,101
It stimulates the immune system...

284
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,366
and inhibits the growth of parasites in the intestines.

285
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,270
So, how's life at the co-op?

286
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,972
Our membership is up 15% since you left...

287
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,811
in spite of the corporate outfits breathing down our necks.

288
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,011
- Wow, sounds like things are going great. - We miss you.

289
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,353
You should stop in and say hello while you're here.

290
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,788
- So, how's life back in LA? - It's okay.

291
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,294
What can I say? I may have finally found something I'm good at.

292
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,766
- I always knew you had a spiritual calling. - Yeah, right.

293
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,999
What? Being a funeral director is proof of a spiritual calling?

294
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:28,511
It's not exactly what I imagined for Nate, but it doesn't surprise me.

295
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,517
Nothing ever surprises you, Lisa.

296
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,012
That's true.

297
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,729
So, last time I spoke to you, back in January...

298
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,890
I suppose, you had met somebody?

299
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,791
- Brenda. - Yeah.

300
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,300
Anything ever happen with that?

301
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,036
We're still together.

302
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,901
Wow! Eight months.

303
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,810
That's gotta be an all-time record for you, Nate.

304
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,313
It might be.

305
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,942
Sounds like a real relationship to me.

306
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,814
What can I say?

307
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,215
It is what it is.

308
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,387
I mean, for me, for where I am at right now, it's a good thing.

309
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,322
- It's all good. - It is. It's all...

310
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,662
well, mostly, you know, good.

311
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,573
I'm really happy for you, Nate.

312
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,874
You know, I got offered a job in LA.

313
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,211
- Really? - Yeah.

314
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:40,683
Some big-time producer came through town shooting a movie.

315
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,414
She's looking for a vegan chef, and she offered me a job.

316
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,217
Really, what movie?

317
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,792
I'm not good with titles. I don't go to the movies.

318
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,421
Film is processed with gelatin. Gelatin comes from horses' hooves.

319
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,295
- I didn't know that. - Most people don't.

320
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,892
Hence the global slavery of animals.

321
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,600
- Were you thinking about taking the job? - I don't know.

322
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,540
I mean, LA is such a godless place.

323
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,910
Besides, my life is really full here.

324
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,447
- May I use your bathroom? - Yeah.

325
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,081
It's down the hall, first door on the left.

326
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,894
- She's a lot like you. - You think?

327
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,259
God, I've missed you, Nate.

328
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,760
I've missed you, too.

329
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,170
Give me a break.

330
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,175
I think you totally cleared out my sinuses.

331
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,868
Not too hard?

332
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,608
Some of my clients find me a little intense.

333
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,711
Not at all.

334
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,152
I love it.

335
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,219
It feels great.

336
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,594
I have to say you're pretty loose.

337
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,428
Not a lot of tension in the usual places.

338
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,901
I'm curious. Melissa, what do you do?

339
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,777
I'm just asking because I'm thinking about changing professions...

340
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,345
and I'm curious.

341
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,577
I'm a prostitute.

342
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,348
No shit?

343
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,319
No shit.

344
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,186
Cool.

345
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,405
I'm making a cup of tea. Want one?

346
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,139
I'd love to, but I've gotta get to work.

347
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,548
- Same time next week? - Absolutely.

348
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,786
- I'll see you. - See you.

349
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,728
- Hello? <i>- Bren. Hi, honey. It's Mom.</i>

350
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,293
<i>I'm at Tranquility Spa.</i> <i>I need you to meet me over here.</i>

351
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,995
- Why? <i>- Sweetheart, it's an emergency.</i>

352
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,163
<i>- I need you over here, please.</i> - What's happened?

353
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,469
<i>I'm at Tranquility Spa, Brenda, in La Cañada.</i>

354
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,703
<i>I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important.</i>

355
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,243
Brenda! Don't go in there.

356
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,842
Mother, let go of my fucking arm. You're hurting me!

357
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,717
This is your father's car.

358
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,287
So Dad's here. Who cares?

359
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,020
He's not here. He's at work. I checked.

360
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,388
Look on the dash.

361
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,393
Your father doesn't smoke Virginia Slims.

362
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,802
Look on the gear shift.

363
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,035
A scrunchie. Big fucking deal!

364
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,877
Your father hasn't had enough hair to need a scrunchie since 19<i>7</i>5!

365
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,348
- So you think Dad's fucking somebody. - Bingo!

366
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,783
Oh, my God, is that all this is?

367
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,979
I thought you'd heard from the hospital that something happened to Billy.

368
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,252
Don't be so dramatic, Brenda.

369
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,795
I have to go downstairs and work for a little while.

370
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,064
Do you have everything you need?

371
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,498
Can I have some chocolate milk?

372
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,566
I'm sorry. We don't have any chocolate milk.

373
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,276
I want some goddamn chocolate milk.

374
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,174
I'm sorry, but we only have white milk.

375
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,653
Ain't you got any other cookies besides these?

376
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,154
Those are all we have.

377
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:14,055
I don't like these kind. These kind taste like shit.

378
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:18,061
Then just color in your coloring books, and I'll check in on you in a bit.

379
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,960
I don't like coloring books.

380
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,526
- You picked them out at the drugstore. - You told me I had to.

381
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:29,164
- I thought you liked coloring books. - I don't. I told you I like to draw.

382
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,764
Then draw.

383
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,747
These are coloring books.

384
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,106
You can't draw in coloring books...

385
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,778
because they already have the drawings in them.

386
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,447
You can only color in coloring books.

387
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,090
That's why they're called coloring books.

388
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,665
- You wanna watch TV? - Okay.

389
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,034
- You know how to use that? - What do you think, I'm stupid?

390
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,102
- I didn't say you're stupid. - I know how to use a remote.

391
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,204
Fine, knock yourself out.

392
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,677
Dumb-ass cracker.

393
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,155
Man, I am starving for a cheeseburger.

394
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,386
I want something that walked the earth, with the works.

395
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,393
Man, I'm having a double.

396
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:26,957
I thought you liked the meatless meatloaf.

397
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,066
- I lied. - No shit.

398
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,597
And what's with the "it is what it is"...

399
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:37,664
purposely vague bullshit about you and Brenda?

400
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:41,306
I don't want to hurt Lisa's feelings, okay?

401
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,343
You definitely slept with her.

402
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,248
Okay, yes.

403
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:54,054
We had occasional sex together, but it was strictly on a friendship basis.

404
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,854
You were fuck-buddies?

405
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,287
Yeah.

406
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,961
- And nothing more. - Does Lisa know that?

407
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,859
You know what?

408
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,703
Every time we did have sex, and I'm talking about five, six times, tops...

409
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,909
I was very honest with her about what it meant and what it didn't mean.

410
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:21,548
- She's got it bad for you. - I was always honest with Lisa.

411
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,951
- Lf you say so. - What do you want?

412
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:28,959
I want a Chubby Cheese with everything, medium skinny fries, and a Coke.

413
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:34,121
My God, do you smell that?

414
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,831
What, burgers and fries?

415
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,301
No, it's like rotten eggs! Jesus!

416
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,506
Oh, man, déj?fucking vu.

417
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,599
<i>Welcome to Chubby's.</i> <i>May I take your order?</i>

418
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,444
Yeah, I'll have a double Chubby...

419
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,812
I'll have a double Chubby cheeseburger. Fuck me!

420
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,923
<i>- Was that one or two cheeseburgers?</i> - Jesus, my head!

421
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,085
Fuck!

422
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,905
Nate, are you okay?

423
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,787
<i>Sir, I didn't get that.</i> <i>Can I take your order, please?</i>

424
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,629
<i>Hello, sir?</i>

425
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,470
You drive.

426
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,806
I'm gonna get some air and make a phone call.

427
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:54,867
Okay.

428
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,854
<i>- I didn't get that. Please repeat your order.</i> - Shut up.

429
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,969
Yeah, is Dr. DiPaolo in?

430
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,107
Yeah, it's definitely an emergency.

431
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,547
<i>- Can I take your order, please?</i> - Shut the fuck up!

432
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,245
<i>I'm going to have to contact the manager.</i>

433
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,520
I can't believe I'm doing this.

434
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,419
Can't we at least go inside?

435
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,792
I could get a seaweed wrap while I pretend to listen to you.

436
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,056
That couldn't be her.

437
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,963
I'm eating your protein bar.

438
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,802
Maybe it is.

439
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,665
This is like eating upholstery.

440
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,176
I knew it.

441
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:06,748
Bern couldn't get anyone that good-Iooking to jump his saggy ass.

442
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:16,820
I thought you and Dad had an agreement about this sort of thing.

443
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,120
We did. We do.

444
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:24,731
Only this time he broke one of the rules. He didn't tell me first.

445
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,361
So you're not upset Dad's fucking somebody else.

446
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,373
You're upset he didn't tell you he was fucking somebody else.

447
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,703
That's right.

448
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,939
The rule is, if you step outside the holy bonds...

449
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,072
you have to tell your wife first.

450
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,744
So she can line up some young hottie of her own.

451
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,525
I guess that sounds fair.

452
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,361
You have other rules?

453
00:33:55,933 --> 00:34:00,370
- Yeah, a whole slew of them. - Go on, tell me. I'm curious.

454
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:09,003
You can't fuck my friends, I can't fuck yours.

455
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:12,412
No fucking of mutual friends. Never in Hawaii.

456
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,750
Never in a hotel that costs more than $300 a night.

457
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,983
And never in a hotel that's under $<i>7</i>5 a night.

458
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,586
Not on holidays.

459
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:29,124
There are others. I just can't remember all of them at the moment.

460
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,226
Is one of them:

461
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,998
"Never fuck anybody else in front of your kids"?

462
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,166
I guess not. Since there was that time I saw you in the hot tub...

463
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,833
with some old guy with a hairy back.

464
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,208
Darling, your father was there.

465
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,908
And there was absolutely no penetration, I can assure you of that.

466
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:49,282
- I'll bet that wasn't your choice. - And you were supposed to be in bed.

467
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,490
I was only gone a couple of hours, Rico.

468
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,354
Every hour you're gone is an hour I have to stay late.

469
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,193
I'm sorry about your buddy's kid, but I have kids of my own.

470
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:04,257
Is this about us not giving you the loan for the house?

471
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:08,169
Because you never used to complain about having to work a little overtime.

472
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,471
This is about me not wanting to be taken advantage of by my employers.

473
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:16,741
- We're more than just your employers... - That's bullshit, David, and you know it.

474
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,875
When it's convenient, we're like family. But in a pinch, I'm just an employee...

475
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,477
and you and Nate are just my bosses.

476
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,847
Hey, little lady.

477
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,990
Taylor, I told you to wait upstairs.

478
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,722
- My tummy hurts. - Let's go.

479
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,056
Is that man dead?

480
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,995
That man was totally dead.

481
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,744
Yes, that man was totally dead.

482
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,910
- Did you kill him? - No.

483
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,484
- Did that other man in there kill him? - No.

484
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,215
He died of natural causes.

485
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:03,686
My friend Renee said sooner or later we'll all be dead.

486
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:07,796
That's true.

487
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,967
So someday I'll be dead, laying on a table like that?

488
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,094
Not for a very, very long time.

489
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:18,272
My mom says my dad's good as dead as far as she's concerned.

490
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:27,281
That's just her way of expressing anger at him for not being around.

491
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,778
Sometimes my mom says she wishes she was dead.

492
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:38,128
That's just something that people say when they're upset about something.

493
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,393
Did that dead man in there have any kids?

494
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:46,362
Yeah, he had a wife and three children and five grandchildren.

495
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,831
- I don't ever want to die. - Me, neither.

496
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,910
It's called arteriovenous malformation. AVM, for short.

497
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,188
Lots of people have it their whole lives and never even know.

498
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,748
And the pills?

499
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,985
They're an anti-seizure medication.

500
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,863
So what happened to you, that was a seizure?

501
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,196
Sort of.

502
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,867
- Sort of? - It was a mild seizure.

503
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,176
- Does David know about this? - Yes, he does.

504
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,671
I don't want Mom to know 'cause she'll just freak out. All right?

505
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,544
It's no big deal, I promise.

506
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,978
People don't just spaz out...

507
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:39,022
and hork all over their shoes for no good reason.

508
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,456
Two words: Tofu meatloaf.

509
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,694
Besides, now I have these pills it'll be totally under control.

510
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,790
- You swear? - I swear.

511
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:54,262
I just have to take them for the rest of my life is all.

512
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:57,836
I don't believe you.

513
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,536
Just do me a favor and don't tell David about this.

514
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,545
This client of mine's a prostitute.

515
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,353
- Is that supposed to shock me? - What?

516
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,160
God, not everything is about you.

517
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,564
You're such a classic narcissist.

518
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:26,865
Just because your parents are shrinks doesn't mean you know about psychology.

519
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:31,374
Just because you're a shrink doesn't mean that you're not out of your fucking mind.

520
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,777
I've treated several prostitutes over the years...

521
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,577
and they're not as uncommon as you'd think...

522
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:43,784
That's her.

523
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,881
She's your age. I have to talk to her.

524
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:52,122
- Mom, don't. Please don't. - No, wait.

525
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,662
I'm not angry. I'm not going to make a scene.

526
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:58,896
I just need to personalize the experience and humanize the situation.

527
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,104
- It's for all of us. - You'll just regret it.

528
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,000
Miss!

529
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,337
Hello, I'm Margaret, Bern's wife.

530
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,414
You know, Bern and I have a really open relationship...

531
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,282
and I just want you to know it's okay with me.

532
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,915
I'd love to chat, but I've gotta go meet Bern for lunch. Sorry.

533
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,862
Get off, you bitch! I can't believe you!

534
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,998
- Get off of me! - Fine.

535
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,536
You slut!

536
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:34,795
Psycho!

537
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,669
I'll see you in hell.

538
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,741
I hope you like herpes.

539
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,317
You know, I thought she'd be more evolved.

540
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,055
Evolved?

541
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,225
Mother, you just attacked that woman repeatedly.

542
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:07,432
- She could have you thrown in jail. - I seriously doubt that.

543
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,098
Are you hungry?

544
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,501
Why am I here?

545
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,009
Why was it necessary for me to be here with you for this?

546
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,149
Because you needed a fucking audience.

547
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:28,216
- Not everything's about you, Brenda. - Look at Mommy.

548
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,850
Isn't Mommy pretty?

549
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:34,227
Isn't Mommy fabulous and free-spirited and uninhibited?

550
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:37,732
Validate Mommy, kids, because she's incapable of doing it herself.

551
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,532
No wonder Billy ended up in a psych ward. Not that you care.

552
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:44,506
For your information, Miss High and Mighty, this is life.

553
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,609
People have crises.

554
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:50,704
They push each other's buttons. They inflict pain on one another.

555
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:55,343
And once in a fucking blue moon, they bring out the best in each other.

556
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,251
But mostly, they bring out the worst.

557
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,590
- You're pathetic. - Don't you dare judge me.

558
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,960
You think you're the paragon of mental health...

559
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:10,592
just because you've been dating the same man for the past few months?

560
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,967
That's real, compared to what your father and I have?

561
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,172
- You're just jealous. - Of what?

562
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,601
The fact that I haven't allowed you to totally destroy my life...

563
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,145
like you have everybody else's.

564
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,544
What life?

565
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:29,182
You've spent 32 years being your little brother's nursemaid...

566
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,242
Fuck you!

567
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,552
...to avoid having any emotional life of your own.

568
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,225
And now that he's been put away...

569
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,524
you're gonna have to face your own demons.

570
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,498
And, sweetheart, they're legion.

571
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,836
Get out of my car.

572
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,743
I would be happy to.

573
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,230
I hope you like pork roast and mashed potatoes.

574
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,731
They're okay.

575
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:21,060
- Where are you going, dear? - To watch TV.

576
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,936
In this house we eat dinner at the table.

577
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,409
- You don't watch TV while you eat? - No, we don't.

578
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:32,443
Maybe we can watch some TV when we're done eating.

579
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,589
- So, what grade are you in, Taylor? - Fourth.

580
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,656
David was in the fourth grade once.

581
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,264
It's true.

582
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:55,466
Did you know David used to be my Uncle Keith's boyfriend?

583
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,172
Yes, I did.

584
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:06,009
Sometimes my momma calls my Uncle Keith a punk-ass fudgepacker...

585
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,313
'cause he likes men instead of women.

586
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:12,447
I guess that makes you a punk-ass fudgepacker, too, don't it?

587
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,917
We don't use those kinds of words at this table.

588
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,495
- We don't use those kinds of words at all. - How come?

589
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:24,293
- Because those words are... - Hateful. Those are hateful words.

590
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,667
What words do you use?

591
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:31,839
Homosexual.

592
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:39,510
My Uncle Keith has a new boyfriend. His name's Eddie.

593
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:43,253
He drives an ambulance. But I don't like him too much.

594
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:44,980
Why not?

595
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:49,583
He looks at himself in the mirror a lot, and he talks to me like I'm stupid.

596
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,793
- I'm sure that's not true. - Yes, it is.

597
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:56,131
It is true.

598
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,836
Some people just don't know how to talk to children.

599
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,597
Tell me about it.

600
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,278
I think I'll start the dishes.

601
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,396
It's time for you to leave now.

602
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:31,923
Go!

603
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:48,879
- Is everything okay? - Claire, I thought you were taking a nap.

604
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,147
I was reading.

605
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,620
- Where's Nate? - He's outside making a phone call.

606
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,520
Who were you talking to?

607
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,058
Ants.

608
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,462
I'm being overrun by them.

609
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:09,432
At first I tried setting a little food aside for them next to the back door.

610
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,703
Then I tried coaxing them out with some citrus oil.

611
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,142
Now I'm trying to reason with them.

612
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:21,080
At home, my dad used to squirt them with lighter fluid and torch them.

613
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:29,953
I'm not still in love with your brother, if that's what you're thinking.

614
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,120
Actually, I wasn't thinking that.

615
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,399
I used to be.

616
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:41,092
I used to think one day he would realize I was the one for him.

617
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,763
He never has.

618
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,804
Do you think he ever will?

619
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:52,671
I'm probably not the person to be asking that question.

620
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:57,816
He's my brother, but to tell you the truth, I'm just getting to know the guy.

621
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,648
He's a heartbreaker, that's for sure.

622
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,192
There are a dozen women all over Seattle...

623
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,855
who would freak if they knew he was back here.

624
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,700
- You must think I'm so stupid. - No, I don't.

625
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:16,331
- Do you have a boyfriend? - No.

626
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,541
Not anymore.

627
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,210
We broke up.

628
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,911
You're better off, trust me.

629
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,552
Fucking ants.

630
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,388
I just wanted to hear how your day went.

631
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:37,056
My mother practically beat the shit out of a woman in a parking lot...

632
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,061
<i>but apart from that, I'm fine.</i>

633
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,993
<i>- How's Seattle?</i> - Seattle's good.

634
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:44,727
Your mother tried to beat the shit out of somebody?

635
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:48,067
I really don't feel like reliving that right now.

636
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,569
How's it going with Claire?

637
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,041
Great. We're getting along great.

638
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:56,972
Is everything okay?

639
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,514
I just have a headache.

640
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,554
We're gonna hit the road first thing in the morning.

641
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,186
Okay, I'll see you, then.

642
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:13,754
I just ran a bath and it's getting cold, so...

643
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,397
I miss you.

644
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,761
I miss you, too.

645
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:10,980
You never called.

646
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:15,153
How did you know where I live?

647
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,621
That's not really important.

648
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,728
I think maybe it is.

649
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,399
You wanna know what's really important?

650
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:33,770
Show me.

651
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,516
Did she give you a hard time?

652
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,523
Not really.

653
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:28,054
Let me grab her, and we'll get out of your way.

654
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,496
Thanks again.

655
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,700
It's no problem whatsoever.

656
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,543
She's a great kid, Keith. She really is.

657
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:46,571
Considering everything she's been put through, it's kind of a miracle.

658
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,018
We should go.

659
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,528
- Good night, David. - Good night.

660
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:29,987
I thought you might need an extra quilt.

661
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,186
It gets cold in this room.

662
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:34,825
Excellent.

663
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,004
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

664
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,431
- I'm fine. - Are you sure?

665
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,100
Yeah. I'm good.

666
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:53,105
You can't fool me, Nate. I know you too well.

667
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:56,979
I'm fine.

668
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:14,868
Poor baby.

669
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:18,698
It's okay. I'm here.

670
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,074
I'm right here.

671
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,338
It's okay.

672
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:43,997
- Are you sure you don't want any breakfast? - I'm good. I never eat breakfast.

673
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,627
Lisa, have you seen my old brown flannel shirt?

674
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:51,162
I'm pretty sure it got donated to the co-op garage sale.

675
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,641
Here it is.

676
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,179
I love that shirt. It's so Nate.

677
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,981
- Why don't you hang on to it? - No, I couldn't.

678
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:06,954
I want you to have it.

679
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:10,254
- What would I want with your shirt? - Would you just keep it?

680
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,788
We should probably hit the road and pick up Mr. Mossback.

681
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,127
Right.

682
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:26,297
As always, it's been great seeing you.

683
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,573
- Take care of yourself, Nate. - You, too.

684
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,947
- It was nice to meet you. - Nice meeting you, Claire.

685
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,695
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

686
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,494
Morning, Mom.

687
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:59,809
It's awfully quiet around here with Nate and Claire being gone.

688
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,002
I suppose it is.

689
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:07,271
What time did your friend come by to pick up his niece?

690
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:09,877
1:30.

691
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:13,415
That's awfully late for a child her age to be up.

692
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,617
She was asleep on the sun porch.

693
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:25,526
- Is there something you'd like to say to me? - No.

694
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,394
Yes, there is.

695
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:32,873
I'm all ears.

696
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:38,813
Your father used to say that to me all the time. "I'm all ears."

697
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,909
Sometimes you remind me of him.

698
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,249
What's on your mind?

699
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:51,388
You have to be careful with children...

700
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:55,555
because their blueprints are being drafted by the adults in their lives.

701
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,600
And this little girl...

702
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:03,235
It seems to me that her foundation is probably unstable enough...

703
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,206
without you bringing your...

704
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,305
My what?

705
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,442
Your relationship with her uncle, you have to admit...

706
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,212
might be a little confusing to someone her age.

707
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,822
I'm happy for you if this whole plan thing of yours has enabled you...

708
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,159
to draft your own blueprint...

709
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:31,496
or patch up some of the cracks in your foundation.

710
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:36,462
But just between you and me, you're starting to sound like a crazy person.

711
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,772
I think it's time you kept that shit to yourself...

712
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,403
and minded your own fucking business.

713
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:08,693
Thank you.

714
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:25,683
It's a little weird driving a dead guy all the way back to LA.

715
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,349
It's only weird if you make it weird.

716
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,586
- It's a little weird. - It's not.

717
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,932
You know, Nate, I don't know why...

718
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:44,637
but it's comforting to know you're just as fucked up as the rest of us.

719
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,336
I'm not anywhere near as fucked up as the rest of you.

720
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,105
- You are. - I'm not.

721
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:52,711
- Yes, you are. - Shut up and drive.
