

1
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,738
<i>... a report by this entertainment industry</i> <i>analyst released today...</i>

2
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,372
<i>showed a severe drop in the summer</i> <i>box office results at the major studios.</i>

3
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,417
<i>A Warner Brothers spokesperson</i> <i>pooh-poohed the projections...</i>

4
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,037
Previn?

5
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,370
Previn, are you in there?

6
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,116
It's George, the building manager.

7
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,381
I started to smell something a few days ago...

8
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,014
but I just thought someone was cooking cabbage.

9
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,059
See? You can still smell it. I'm not crazy.

10
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,992
Oh, my God!

11
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,242
I'm just surprised.

12
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,578
Why? I told you I was going to write a book.

13
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,244
- No, you didn't. - I thought I did.

14
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,855
- What? - I need to get in there.

15
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,754
So you're just gonna sit down today and start writing?

16
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,729
Yeah, I think that's how it's usually done.

17
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,663
Except for Hemingway. He stood.

18
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,797
- What? - I need to get in there now.

19
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,703
- What? You think I can't write a book? - No, of course not.

20
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,717
It's just a book is so big.

21
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,850
Not all of them.

22
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,549
Well, it's just the last time we talked about you doing something new...

23
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,152
you mentioned getting Billy's friends to help you open an art gallery.

24
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,958
Yeah, well, I got to thinking.

25
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,522
I don't need to help others express themselves.

26
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,465
I should do it myself.

27
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,468
I think this is great.

28
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,369
Charlotte finally speaks.

29
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,308
Your fucked up childhood from your point of view. People will want to read that.

30
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,278
No way. I'm not gonna write a memoir.

31
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,275
What is it, then?

32
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,109
- Fiction. - Really?

33
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,256
That's so ambitious. I love it.

34
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,791
I hope I'm going to be in it. I've always wanted to be thinly veiled.

35
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,594
You might be in it...

36
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,960
if you ever do anything interesting.

37
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,740
I need help.

38
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,037
Do you think the hair on Mr. Peterson's forearms is sexy?

39
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,309
Or is it too unkempt? Sometimes he gets all tufty.

40
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,350
I really don't have time for this.

41
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,909
This weekend is my last chance to take the SATs. I have to do well.

42
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,252
Just take a break. It'll keep you from burning out.

43
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:03,189
Every fall, I rate the male teachers' fuckability.

44
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,258
I've been doing it since the sixth grade.

45
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,130
I am, like, 400 times smarter than you.

46
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,500
Why aren't you panicking more about this test?

47
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,539
Because I know how to play the game.

48
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,439
I have a tutor. I've taken practice tests.

49
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,042
And my mom's life coach is advising me.

50
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,977
Your mom's life coach?

51
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:25,149
Parker, do you have any idea what a parody of yourself you are?

52
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,545
I feel bad for Mr. Van Kirk.

53
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,023
If he hadn't stopped working out, he could've easily cracked the top 10.

54
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,226
Give me that.

55
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,988
Gitterman's coming in at 22?

56
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,692
I was feeling generous.

57
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,167
- Hey, Claire. - Gary, hi.

58
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,565
- See you this afternoon? - Yep.

59
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,872
Gary has a great ass.

60
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,716
- You think he has a great ass? - Yeah.

61
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,477
Like you haven't noticed.

62
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:07,114
My mom calls them buns. She's so not of this century.

63
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,185
I don't care how much she pays her life coach.

64
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,357
I could fuck Gary. Easy.

65
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:23,601
So this woman in her 40s just died alone in her apartment?

66
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,640
Just out of the blue?

67
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,847
I mean, she must have had some kind of medical condition.

68
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,884
No, she choked to death.

69
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,050
She lay there for a week before anyone found her.

70
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,522
Why didn't anybody notice sooner?

71
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,689
Maybe they thought she was on vacation.

72
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,958
Here are the arrangements for her funeral. They're self-explanatory.

73
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,090
You should be able to take care of it.

74
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,033
Shouldn't I talk to whoever's gonna bury her?

75
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,866
Nate, it's a pre-need. She buried herself.

76
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,499
She bought everything she wanted ahead of time.

77
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:59,238
You have her contacts for family and friends, directions for the service...

78
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,678
and the specifications about her restoration.

79
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,545
She knew exactly what kind of service she wanted.

80
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,415
You'll need to order the sheet music for the organist.

81
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,081
<i>And I am telling you I'm not going.</i>

82
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,148
She certainly had a sense of humor.

83
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,326
What song is that?

84
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,420
It's from <i>Dreamgirls.</i> You know it:

85
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,227
<i>And I am telling you</i>

86
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,028
<i>I'm not going</i>

87
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,729
<i>You're the best man I've ever known</i>

88
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,409
It must be weird to fill one of these things out for yourself.

89
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,273
I had fun doing mine.

90
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,496
I have a test on Monday, I have an art history paper due next week.

91
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,406
I know I could do a good job on both if I had more time, but I don't.

92
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,037
- Do I have something on my face? - No.

93
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,708
You're giving me this look.

94
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,313
It's just nice to see you so involved.

95
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,423
Are you taking the SAT this weekend?

96
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,617
I saw the books in the library.

97
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,184
- I don't know why I didn't tell you. - It's okay.

98
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,595
- I just signed up for it. I wasn't sure. - No, it's great.

99
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:03,465
You're taking school more seriously, and you're gonna take the SAT.

100
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,035
- It shows you're nurturing yourself. - Give me a break.

101
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,540
I'm so scared of having my own thoughts or going my own direction...

102
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,976
that I need some safety or approval.

103
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,775
This stuff is just cop-out distractions.

104
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,549
You know what? This session's given me some clarity.

105
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,587
I should just blow this test off...

106
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:25,283
and look really hard inside myself for what I really want.

107
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:32,528
Claire, you're obviously frightened by taking this test. Why?

108
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,168
I don't know.

109
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:41,135
It's like, when I think about the test...

110
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,202
I see this nasty fluorescent light.

111
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:48,337
The kind that shows all your pockmarks and tiny scars that you wish you could hide.

112
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,574
I see.

113
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,147
So it's very safe in the darkness, isn't it?

114
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,110
Okay, you're getting kind of corny.

115
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:03,621
All I'm saying is you're finally in a place where you're coming into your own.

116
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:09,198
You're afraid if people see the real you, it'll be scary. And guess what? It is scary.

117
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,802
For all of us. Isn't it?

118
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,567
<i>Don't be silly, David.</i>

119
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,512
You don't need to apologize for what you said about the plan.

120
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,016
If you live in a neighborhood for a long time...

121
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:30,021
and somebody moves in and renovates the house across the street...

122
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,422
that could just make you feel your own house is shabby.

123
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,652
I see.

124
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,661
- Did you just insult me? - Of course not.

125
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,996
You'll see.

126
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,200
When you're ready, you're going to live in a palace.

127
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,596
Claire, wash your hands. We're about to eat.

128
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,162
Don't set a place for me. I'm not staying.

129
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,240
- Who are you having dinner with? - No one.

130
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,438
I'm having coffee with someone I met at St. Stephen's.

131
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,505
David, if you have a date, just say it.

132
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,052
Nothing ever gets built if the materials aren't labeled properly.

133
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,013
Okay, I have a date.

134
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,526
David, I'm having a problem with the Emily Previn funeral.

135
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,083
Let's hear it.

136
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:14,321
I've called her entire contact list, and the friends she listed have moved or died.

137
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,025
She has two distant relatives.

138
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,833
One of which I can't reach, and the other has this phobia about funerals.

139
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,702
Some people are so sick.

140
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,675
Now we know why she wasn't found for a week.

141
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,004
- I don't think she had anybody in her life. - How awful.

142
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,447
Have you called her job to notify her colleagues about the service?

143
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,975
No. She worked at a temp agency, so she just had jobs here and there.

144
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,579
She must have had someone that she forgot to list.

145
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,853
Try her high school. Everyone has friends from high school.

146
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,450
No, they don't.

147
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,395
Maybe they have people they talk to, or do things with...

148
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,398
but they're not really friends.

149
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,229
They're just filler.

150
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,162
What? It's true.

151
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,273
I want a glass of wine.

152
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,737
Oh, God.

153
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,634
It's so weird.

154
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,876
Who the hell was Emily Previn?

155
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,843
Nate, are you okay?

156
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,953
- Yeah, I'm fine. - 'Cause your eyes look really weird.

157
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:15,953
Yeah, it's just this medication I'm taking. It makes me a little drowsy. That's all.

158
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,258
Honestly.

159
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,033
Maybe Emily Previn was autistic.

160
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:29,973
I read an article about a high-functioning autistic person who didn't need people.

161
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,341
She just had a job designing these big cattle slaughterhouses.

162
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,040
At night, she came home and sat in a machine...

163
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,310
that made her feel like she was being hugged.

164
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,909
And that was all the intimacy she needed.

165
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,613
That's really upsetting.

166
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,350
I don't see why this person has to be mentally ill...

167
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:49,884
just because she had a life that doesn't conform to a familiar image in our heads.

168
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,824
Maybe she was living the life she wanted.

169
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,093
A life without the hassle of other people.

170
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,294
What kind of a life is that?

171
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,802
"Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor...

172
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:07,039
"but how was I supposed to know it was your car?"

173
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:11,672
- I don't think I could be a public defender. - No? Why not?

174
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,844
I just don't think I could defend people who are guilty.

175
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,083
I guess I could be a some-of-the-public defender.

176
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,059
So, what do you do?

177
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:27,021
Me? My family owns a business. Actually, it's a funeral home.

178
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,837
But I got out of that really quickly, and now I'm in textiles.

179
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,831
I like fabric.

180
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,976
I have to be in court in the morning. I have a lot of work...

181
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,813
- Okay. Maybe we'll see each other around. - David, relax.

182
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,946
It's fine. I understand. I guess there's not much of a spark here.

183
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,820
I thought there was. You don't?

184
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,558
No, I do. I was just worried.

185
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,657
I'm sorry, Ben. I get a little nervous at these things.

186
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,725
If I seem calm, it's only because I take a beta-blocker...

187
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:08,205
before I have to get in front of a jury or first dates.

188
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:12,803
You're still nervous on the inside, but you don't show it as much.

189
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,743
Do you have any extra?

190
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,944
Let's go on a real date next time. Like, for dinner.

191
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,546
Okay, that would be nice.

192
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,127
You seem a little...

193
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:35,092
- Are you coming out of a bad breakup? - No, I'm coming out of a bad celibacy.

194
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,863
I was in a relationship, but that ended.

195
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,303
Well, whatever happened, I blame him.

196
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,840
You shouldn't. He's a great guy.

197
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,849
You get your spoiled little ass into that bed right now! Do you hear me?

198
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:52,941
You suck!

199
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,043
Right now! I mean it!

200
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,112
I'm not tired.

201
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:02,118
When I'm at my real home, I don't have to go to sleep until I get tired.

202
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,721
I'm going to turn off the lights now, and soon you'll be tired.

203
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,288
What if I never get tired?

204
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:11,234
Then you'll lay awake for hours and hours wondering why life is so hard.

205
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,134
That's what the rest of us do.

206
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,934
That sounds boring.

207
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,969
You get used to it.

208
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,319
Do you want to talk about anything?

209
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,550
Like how you feel about staying here?

210
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,794
Or being scared, because your mom's been in Oakland so long?

211
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:37,886
No.

212
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,327
Okay. But we don't know how long you're gonna be here.

213
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,632
So why don't we both try and ease up on each other a little bit, okay?

214
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,600
You guys have bad toothpaste.

215
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:54,735
My first instinct is to get angry with her. I open my mouth, I hear my father.

216
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,144
Stop being so hard on yourself. That child is not easy.

217
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,121
I swore to myself I would never be like him.

218
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,924
I'm not in the mood.

219
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,460
Fine.

220
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,778
<i>Get up!</i>

221
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,995
<i>- Hello?</i> - Hi, Melissa. It's Brenda.

222
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,300
Chenowith.

223
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,273
Your massage therapist.

224
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,906
Hey, how's it going?

225
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,510
Listen, I was just wondering if you hadn't eaten yet...

226
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,549
<i>if you wanted to have lunch.</i>

227
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,108
Actually, I'm at a restaurant right now.

228
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:19,323
<i>Look, I'm probably breaking</i> <i>all these client/masseuse boundaries.</i>

229
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,859
I'll see you at your regular appointment tomorrow.

230
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,919
No, I was just gonna say I'm by myself. I'd love the company.

231
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,328
<i>Thank God.</i>

232
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,974
Oh, Jesus!

233
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,741
This one's gonna be one hell of a ride.

234
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,214
I'm sure you'll be able to take care of it.

235
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,751
Yeah? Well, don't be.

236
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:50,276
She must've been laying out for a week in a partially-ventilated space.

237
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,846
Why can't everyone die in an air-conditioned room?

238
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,257
Her face is discolored from being lain on.

239
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,955
That I can fix, although it's gonna take me hours.

240
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,466
Her abdomen's all distended. This woman's got a lot of gas in there.

241
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,127
When I poke a hole, we're gonna get some major fumes.

242
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,636
Whew, Nellie!

243
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,036
I have no idea why I came in here.

244
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,904
- Maybe you have Alzheimer's. - Yeah, maybe.

245
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,714
We really are just biology, aren't we?

246
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,455
You may need to talk the family out of an open casket.

247
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:32,122
- There's only so much I can do, man. - She doesn't have any family.

248
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,963
- No one? - No friends, or anybody.

249
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,029
I ran an obituary in the paper today.

250
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,732
I'm just praying someone will read it and come tomorrow.

251
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,069
Pre-need?

252
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,004
If she wanted an open casket, we'll try to give her one.

253
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,674
I'll boost up the fluids and see if that'll bring the swelling down.

254
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:57,017
There's a good chance we're going to get some skin slippage, and then we're screwed.

255
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:03,552
Maybe she was just some vicious asshole, you know?

256
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,889
Just twisted and evil. Maybe that's why she didn't have any people in her life.

257
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:09,991
No.

258
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,536
You can tell what kind of life people lived even when they're dead.

259
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,210
Yeah, she was all right.

260
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:28,212
Please have your IDs out and ready so we can speed things along.

261
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,488
- Claire Fisher. - ID?

262
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,558
- Sign right here. - Name?

263
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,096
- Parker McKenna. - Let's see.

264
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,290
Parker. Sign here, please.

265
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:44,927
Next?

266
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,403
Does anybody have an extra number two pencil?

267
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,871
Here you go.

268
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,477
So it sounds like a pretty serious relationship for you.

269
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,707
It is.

270
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,941
I love Nate. I really do.

271
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,850
But, lately, I feel kind of separate from him.

272
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,785
Which I know is healthy on one level.

273
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,790
But, on another, I kind of miss how it was.

274
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,229
When we started seeing each other and weren't together...

275
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,566
I'd be wondering, "What is he doing," all day long.

276
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,829
Now?

277
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,733
I never even think about it.

278
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,942
I don't know exactly when I changed.

279
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:34,849
But at some point, he became less present with me.

280
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:40,587
<i>Sometimes I think it's because</i> <i>I don't give him enough to be present for.</i>

281
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,619
<i>But then I think, maybe he's not present</i> <i>because he knows if he was really present...</i>

282
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,727
then I'd leave him.

283
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,769
<i>You know, it's just so sad</i> <i>that you can love somebody so much...</i>

284
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,140
<i>and have absolutely no idea</i> <i>what's going on in their head.</i>

285
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,773
- Relationships are fucked. - That's what I always say.

286
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,350
I haven't had a real relationship in over a decade.

287
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,418
- Is that because you... - Because I blow guys for money?

288
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,654
I'm so sorry. That was...

289
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,127
It's okay.

290
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,424
I've only been doing that for about five years.

291
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,901
So why, then?

292
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,195
I'm just not built for it. Some people aren't, I think.

293
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,539
It's not healthy or unhealthy. It just is.

294
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,844
Oh, shit.

295
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,482
I'm being paged by a client.

296
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,284
I am not driving out to Calabasas in this traffic.

297
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,262
Let the jerk whack off.

298
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,795
You know, I'm really glad you could have lunch.

299
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,062
Me, too.

300
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,098
You know, it means a lot to me that you're so normal around me.

301
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,104
Most people have preconceived notions about what I do.

302
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,410
Yeah, well, people can be such judgmental assholes.

303
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,313
You don't have to tell me that.

304
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,511
You want to know what's worse?

305
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,719
Most girls want to be my friend so that they can pump me...

306
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,123
for all the gory details about being a lady of the evening.

307
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,930
It's just question after question, like I'm some kind of freak.

308
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,401
- All right, you get three questions. - Oh, goody!

309
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,472
There's that one.

310
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,104
No, I think that one makes you look fat.

311
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,547
Very funny.

312
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,880
Which one do you think will look better on Miss Previn?

313
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:49,978
The pink one.

314
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:53,252
Didn't she specify which gown she wanted, or did Dad slip up?

315
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,022
No, Dad didn't slip up. She wanted to be buried in her own clothes.

316
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:00,656
- The outfit she came in with was shot. - Give her the blue to get rid of it.

317
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,131
It's coming apart in the back.

318
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,360
David!

319
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,367
- Mom, did you want something? - I was dusting your casket wall.

320
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,769
If this woman wanted to be buried in her own clothes...

321
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,971
then one of you boys should go to her home and pick something out.

322
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,673
Isn't that a bit much?

323
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:21,276
I remember Dad doing it once or twice. You get the building manager to let you in.

324
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,947
Fine. I'll pick out something dressy.

325
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,123
Considering the shape her body's in...

326
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,489
I should pick whatever covers her up the most.

327
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,959
I'll come with you.

328
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,758
- You don't have to do that. - I know that.

329
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:39,002
Aren't the guys scary? It must get dangerous.

330
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,771
To tell you the truth, it doesn't.

331
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:46,141
You just have to trust your instinct. It's never wrong.

332
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,071
We're kind of like animals that way.

333
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,683
When I first meet a client, I take a good long look into his eyes.

334
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,880
That stupid stuff they say about looking in people's eyes is true.

335
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,446
- You just look into them, and you know. - Know what?

336
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:03,324
You know, whether someone is right, or whether they're...

337
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,797
you know, wrong.

338
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,397
And if they're wrong, you just get out of there immediately.

339
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,165
No. I think everyone has the answers to everything in life.

340
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,209
- It's a matter of knowing how to listen. - You're fantastic!

341
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,903
Fuck, you are!

342
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:24,745
There is no bullshit with you! You are just who you are. Period.

343
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,845
Even the way you talk about your work.

344
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,514
You provide a service for which you're well-compensated.

345
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,486
- Unlike the rest of us losers. - Please.

346
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,862
If there was anything else that paid this much, I would do it in a heartbeat.

347
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,024
But there's not a touch of victimhood about you.

348
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,601
It's almost like it's empowering, in a way.

349
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,002
I went through that whole feminist rationalization stuff at first.

350
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,507
Now I'm just a little more honest.

351
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,776
It's just a way to pay the bills.

352
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,306
Sorry I can't make it to the funeral.

353
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,681
My kid's got a soccer game.

354
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,120
She was one of your tenants, for God's sake.

355
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,418
She lived among you.

356
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,823
Hey, come on. I just started, all right?

357
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,384
She only lived among me for a week.

358
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,960
She never even got to finish her crossword puzzle.

359
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,126
All right, look.

360
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,628
- Five minutes? - Yep. Great.

361
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,168
Mom!

362
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,078
Eddie needs to adapt to how things have changed.

363
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,548
I have a lot more responsibility now.

364
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:36,576
He needs to be more understanding that sometimes I'm gonna be tired, man.

365
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,385
- Yeah, kids come first. Period. - Exactly.

366
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,323
Have you had this conversation with him?

367
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:46,797
He'd just say I need to make more time for him, which would piss me off.

368
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,233
So why bother talking to him about it?

369
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,167
Because you keep everything bottled up inside you, my friend.

370
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,205
That's not good. That creates cancer.

371
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,739
- Give me a break. - It does.

372
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,970
My wife's cousin was a very angry person, but she never showed it.

373
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:02,241
She just cleaned all day, then she lost both her breasts.

374
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,439
It's weird.

375
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,141
You get away from me, dickless fuck!

376
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,686
- You don't own me. - What the fuck's wrong with you?

377
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:12,052
You know, you fucking lie to me, bitch!

378
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,354
Bitch, I'll blow your fucking brains out, you stupid cunt!

379
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,190
I wish you would, but you don't got the balls to shoot me!

380
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,323
- Police! Drop the gun! - Stay out of this! Fucking cops!

381
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:22,457
Drop the gun.

382
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,435
You shoot me, they'll shoot you. Then you'll be dead!

383
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,937
You know what? The world will be a better place!

384
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,031
- Shut up! - Drop the gun now!

385
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,872
What is wrong with you? What did you do that for?

386
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,577
What's wrong with you?

387
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:51,123
I like all of these, but they seem so flat.

388
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,398
I wish one had a little more oomph.

389
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:58,027
- Just grab that one. That one has oomph. - No, it doesn't.

390
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,432
Don't rush me, Nate. I'm not nearly done...

391
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,998
and I haven't even started with the shoes and the jewelry.

392
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,378
Nate Fisher.

393
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,614
Yeah, hi. I left a message there for Father Martin Farrell.

394
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,287
He was requested by the deceased to officiate at her funeral.

395
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,858
Great! Well, I'm fucked.

396
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:25,989
I'm sorry, Sister.

397
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,994
Are there any other priests you'd recommend for a funeral tomorrow?

398
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:15,469
Mom?

399
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,942
- What, are you hungry? - Of course not.

400
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,818
- Then, are you ready to go? - I don't know.

401
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,215
Maybe she liked solitude.

402
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,928
Maybe she was living the life she wanted and was happy.

403
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,327
I hope so.

404
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,134
But what if some nights, she wanted to talk to someone...

405
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,965
and she picked up the phone...

406
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:43,406
and realized she didn't have anyone she could call? What then?

407
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,939
We don't know that she didn't have anyone to call. Maybe there was someone.

408
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,344
I hope so.

409
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:27,384
No one thinks you did anything wrong. You were just doing your job, okay?

410
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,322
Now I know what's different.

411
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,791
You're not wearing your glasses tonight.

412
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,695
I was getting dressed, and nothing looked right...

413
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,358
and I realized it was all my glasses' fault.

414
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,828
So I put in these contacts, which I actually hate...

415
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,668
but I thought it was worth it, if you'd...

416
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,539
This is me without beta-blockers.

417
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,378
It's good.

418
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,982
Maybe it's even better.

419
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,786
- I still work in the family business. - Excuse me?

420
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,990
I'm a funeral director, that's who I am.

421
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:20,026
I have to say, I'm glad you're not in textiles. That sounded really dull.

422
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,931
Why did you lie?

423
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,670
Well, come on.

424
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:29,041
People always get that look in their eyes, like there's something wrong with you.

425
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:33,982
They wait about 5 seconds before bringing the conversation around to necrophilia.

426
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:38,346
I just liked you too much, and I was scared it would repulse you.

427
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,582
So what made you tell me now?

428
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,495
Because on our last date, I just sort of liked you...

429
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,355
and now I really like you.

430
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:54,397
- So I didn't screw things up because I lied? - No, I think it's cute.

431
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:00,633
- And I'm gonna wanna take this slow. - All right.

432
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,907
Can we just make out, already?

433
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,932
We had plans to meet tonight. At the Tiki Ti.

434
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,262
Did we?

435
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:28,094
Claire, why did you blow me off? And why didn't you return my phone calls?

436
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,436
Because I have nothing to say to you.

437
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:35,469
Look, I know this is about the SATs, but it wasn't my fault.

438
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:39,679
It was my mother's idea. She heard about this girl through one of her friends.

439
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:43,016
She's this genius from Westlake who's going around taking the test.

440
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,055
And let me tell you, it works.

441
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,523
She got three people into Yale and five into Harvard.

442
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:52,287
- This is so gross. - What was I supposed to do?

443
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:57,267
My mom came into my room last night and told me she'd already paid the girl $1,000.

444
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,168
You make me so sick. Just get out of here!

445
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,530
Okay? I don't feel like ever seeing you again.

446
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,636
- You're serious? - Yeah, I am.

447
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,771
Fine. Fuck you, Claire!

448
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:16,383
By the way, I flirted for 45 minutes with Gary Deitman outside of school yesterday...

449
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,547
and he's this total horny little freak.

450
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,352
And I'm gonna bag him, big time.

451
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,919
Congratulations. I hope you and his stupid buns will be very happy together!

Keith, what's wrong?

457
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,250
I'm not sure.

458
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,896
Okay. Come in and sit down.

459
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,601
I shouldn't have even come here.

460
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:09,901
It's fine.

461
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,807
You want a beer?

462
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:15,368
- I have Rolling Rock or Amstel Light... - I killed someone today.

463
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,142
- Oh, my God. - It was this guy...

464
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,784
Him and his woman were having a fight.

465
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,386
They were obviously both high on something.

466
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,355
He had a gun and...

467
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:31,486
I'm sure whatever it was, you did the right thing.

468
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,620
He's dead, you fucking idiot!

469
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,966
I should have aimed at his arm or his leg.

470
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,603
I'm stupid.

471
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,707
I'm so fucking stupid.

472
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,141
I never killed someone before.

473
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,751
I can't live with this.

474
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,022
I don't know how to help you.

475
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,184
Do you want to pray?

476
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,458
Maybe that would do something.

477
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,685
David's not up yet?

478
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,760
So where's Emily Previn?

479
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,888
She's in there.

480
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,632
So she's not gonna have an open casket.

481
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,266
- I couldn't do it. - Okay.

482
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:55,835
I was supposed to take the kids to dinner so Vanessa could have the night off.

483
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,904
But instead, I was here.

484
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,181
Until 9:00 last night.

485
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,646
Skin was fricking pouring off that woman's face!

486
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:07,521
I get all this shit from Vanessa, and I wasn't able to restore the poor lady!

487
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:08,991
Nobody could have.

488
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,221
But, here, you think you can do it?

489
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,224
Here's some tools.

490
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:16,664
I want to watch you swim in that skin. Go ahead!

491
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,497
All I said was okay.

492
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,909
I'm sorry.

493
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,379
I just wish I could've done her the way she wanted.

494
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:39,082
If it'll make you feel any better, I don't think there are even gonna be any mourners.

495
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,820
Thanks.

496
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,064
Hello?

497
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,702
It's me.

498
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,735
- I thought you were still here. <i>- I had to get back home.</i>

499
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,074
Are you okay?

500
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,252
Yeah, I'm fine.

501
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,454
Listen, what happened last night, that was wrong.

502
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:17,091
<i>I don't know why I went to you,</i> <i>but obviously I wasn't thinking right.</i>

503
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,293
Obviously.

504
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,289
I'm in a relationship.

505
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,296
I know that. I'm not an idiot.

506
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,269
I just thought you and I could be friends...

507
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,669
but I was just kidding myself.

508
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:35,243
<i>Look, I don't think that you and I</i> <i>should see each other anymore.</i>

509
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,543
David?

510
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,687
Yeah, I'm here. Sure, whatever you want.

511
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,852
I knew you would understand.

512
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,721
Goodbye.

513
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:55,891
Bye.

514
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:07,008
Thank you. That was intense.

515
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,873
You're practically like jelly. You don't need this.

516
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,677
Maybe not, but I love it.

517
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,950
You're gifted, you know that?

518
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,148
Hello?

519
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:24,854
Don't give me that bullshit. I want your ass there in half an hour.

520
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,226
Okay, fuck you. You are officially dead to me now.

521
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,494
Everything okay?

522
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:35,164
I have a client at 2:15, and my watcher just cancelled.

523
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,637
Your watcher?

524
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:39,733
He likes to be watched by another girl while I do him.

525
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,108
It's the easiest $100 in the world...

526
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:46,281
and this asshole just blew me off for a runway audition.

527
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,079
God, I hate models.

528
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,678
Fuck.

529
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:55,454
If you're sitting in the corner depressed, pick up.

530
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,254
Pick up.

531
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,396
All right, be depressed.

532
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,100
Listen, if you're in a jam...

533
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,499
This isn't a science project, honey. This is business.

534
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,098
Please. You think I can't handle it?

535
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,511
Like I said, it's pretty easy.

536
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,349
Actually, it's like you're invisible. Just sitting and watching.

537
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,684
I can do that.

538
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,953
I sit and watch all the time. In fact, that's mostly all I do.

539
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:32,154
I guess you've been in three-way situations before.

540
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,322
- I mean, who hasn't? - Yeah.

541
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,761
Fuck.

542
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,900
I've never seen you this angry before. It's terrific!

543
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,374
- No, my nephew made that. - Sorry.

544
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,071
Here, talk to me.

545
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:52,343
This girl cheated on the SATs, and now she's gonna get away with it.

546
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,247
Okay, what's this girl's name?

547
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,820
When I realized what was going on, I just wanted to run and not take the test.

548
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,417
But I did. I took it, like an idiot. And what was the point?

549
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,462
It's all just some stupid game.

550
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,963
I don't know what I want, but I don't want this.

551
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,727
And this is your excuse to bail?

552
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,394
Bail? What's that? Some hip lingo you think kids say?

553
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,304
- You are so lame sometimes. - Direct your anger at me, if you need to.

554
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:20,776
By the way, you can fuck Parker McKenna, but if I were you, I'd wear a condom...

555
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,439
because I'm sure she has hepatitis, at the very least.

556
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,607
What are you talking about?

557
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,816
If you're referring to the conversation I had with Parker, that's all it was.

558
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,218
A conversation.

559
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:35,281
I have conversations with lots of young women. They approach me.

560
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,289
Claire, I'm worried about you.

561
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,122
Why?

562
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,860
You're getting your life together, and it scares you.

563
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:47,734
So you want to slip into the old habit of focusing on someone else's drama...

564
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:51,571
instead of concentrating on yourself. You need to stop doing that.

565
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,147
You're right.

566
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:08,223
And now is probably as good a time as any to talk about the sexual tension between us.

567
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,360
- What? - It exists.

568
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,525
It's a part of transference and counter-transference...

569
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:18,295
so we should acknowledge it's out there, and it'll never be acted upon...

570
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,827
because to do so would be irresponsible and destructive.

571
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:30,380
Do you have anything that you would like to contribute?

572
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,049
No, I don't.

573
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:36,544
Okay.

574
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:44,955
I bet you I could glue this together if I tried hard.

575
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,059
I know people don't really glue things together anymore...

576
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,363
but I could probably fix this.

577
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,372
<i>You've reached the private line</i> <i>of David Fisher.</i>

578
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,814
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

579
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:11,716
<i>Hi, David. It's Ben. I'm calling to figure out</i> <i>what time's good for you on Saturday.</i>

580
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:16,392
<i>And I had a really good time last night,</i> <i>especially the making out part.</i>

581
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,786
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

582
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,363
Yeah, honey.

583
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:34,200
You know exactly how I like it.

584
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,077
Come on. Move your tongue around it.

585
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,485
Yeah.

586
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,359
<i>And I am telling you</i>

587
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:34,226
<i>I'm not going</i>

588
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:39,035
<i>I'm the best man you'll ever know</i>

589
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,207
<i>There's no way I could ever go</i>

590
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,441
Nate, I love you!

591
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:02,889
Now that I've heard this song five times in a row, I can honestly say I dislike it.

592
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,957
I'm here for the service.

593
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,830
Look around, nobody's here. There's not gonna be any service.

594
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:11,431
I couldn't even get a minister, and they get paid.

595
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:15,535
I've taken care of that. Father Jack is on his way here right now.

596
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,103
- Just give me 10 minutes. - For what?

597
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,179
- Federico? - Yes, Mrs. F?

598
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,155
Could you come upstairs, please?

599
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,057
Keith?

600
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,527
David, I need you for a few minutes.

601
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:44,005
- Mom, I have a headache. - Too bad.

602
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,839
- But I'm in the middle of a show. - Just do what I say!

603
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,381
And get out of those ragamuffin clothes.

604
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,521
Why is this happening?

605
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,826
I don't know. Our structures probably need new fencing.

606
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:08,854
- And our roofs had bad shingles. - I had shingles once.

607
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,665
She was supposed to have an open casket.

608
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,767
I did the best I could, okay?

609
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,743
I didn't see you down there helping me out.

610
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:24,976
Leave it alone.

611
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,649
We gather to mourn the passing of Emily Previn.

612
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,418
I did not know Emily Previn.

613
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:40,395
>From what I gather, few, if any, people did.

614
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,363
People might wonder what point there is in leading a life...

615
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:47,835
where you don't touch any other lives.

616
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:51,164
But it would be arrogant of us to assume that.

617
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:56,536
Every life is a contribution. We just may not see how.

618
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:01,774
I'm glad to encounter Emily Previn, even if it is in death.

619
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,617
Everyone comes into our life for a reason...

620
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:09,716
and it is our responsibility to learn what they have to teach us.

621
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:15,988
Now, in accordance with Emily's wishes...

622
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:19,001
I will read from the Book of Matthew, Chapter 11.

623
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,799
<i>Strange, but somehow I feel like Emily won.</i>

624
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:25,537
She remains a fucking question mark right up to the bitter end.

625
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:30,444
Basically all I know about her is that she kept Wheat Thins in her refrigerator.

626
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,108
That's something.

627
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,152
So, tell your mother I have to get back to work.

628
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,116
Unlike some people.

629
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:43,217
I'm sorry, Federico, but I have a headache. Am I not allowed to have a headache?

630
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:49,731
- It's so good to see you. - Hello, Father.

631
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,870
How is everything at St. Stephen's?

632
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,737
It's okay.

633
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,944
Apropos of what I said earlier, I wanted to thank you, David.

634
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,109
I'm really glad you came into my life.

635
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:10,312
You will never know how much you taught me about myself.

636
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,151
Really? How so?

637
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,087
Another time, maybe.

638
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,627
- You look a little sad. - I have a headache.

639
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,493
Well, God bless.

640
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:31,635
David, come over here. There's something I want to say to the three of you.

641
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:35,903
Oh, Lord, our gutters are clogged. I think we need to see about removing the leaves.

642
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,708
That's very funny, Claire.

643
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,142
I know you think the plan is ridiculous.

644
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,947
- No, we don't. - We just think it's weird.

645
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:47,214
Did any one of you wonder why I felt the need to change the structure of my life?

646
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,986
Did you even care?

647
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:55,022
At first I didn't understand why I was so upset about Emily Previn.

648
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,295
Then it hit me. I don't want to turn into her.

649
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,629
Life is hard enough without not having people to help you.

650
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:04,299
- But, Mom, you have us. - I do not.

651
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,537
Nate, you've been walking around like a zombie for months.

652
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,170
You're lying in bed during the day, God knows why.

653
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,909
I have a headache.

654
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,415
Claire, I can't even look in your direction...

655
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:18,545
without you acting like it's some incredible imposition.

656
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:22,991
All I want is for us not to be strangers. I want some intimacy.

657
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,723
Give me intimacy.

658
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,890
Won't any of you have intimacy with me?

659
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,998
Okay, I guess I have my answer.

660
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:39,968
Mom, wait.

661
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:44,309
I just think that intimacy should happen a little more organically than this.

662
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,782
Fine. Then I'll simply wait for it like I have been.

663
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:52,720
I just pray that it happens before I end up like Emily Previn.

664
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:55,923
Now, if you'll please excuse me.

665
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:08,732
<i>When I saw you typing at your computer,</i> <i>you had the strangest expression.</i>

666
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,707
I was writing. It's called flow.

667
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,906
You know all about flow, don't you?

668
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,206
Let me ask you a question.

669
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,378
Do you think you and I have as much intimacy as you want?

670
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,721
I don't have as much of anything as I want.

671
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,129
That's not really much of an answer.

672
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,064
It wasn't really much of a question.

673
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,864
Did you remember to lock the door?

674
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:45,430
Yes, I did, for the second time. You've been acting strange tonight.

675
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,603
- What do you mean? - Well, you've been all jumpy.

676
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,847
Oh, God.

677
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:02,481
Okay, something has been on my mind.

678
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:20,432
Nate Fisher...

679
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,677
would you be my wife?

680
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,917
My God, this isn't what I was expecting.

681
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,687
- Is that a no? - No, of course not.

682
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:39,961
It is kind of an ugly ring. It's got these Greek letters on it.

683
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:44,122
Delta Phi Delta. It's my grandfather's fraternity ring.

684
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,726
I found it when I was cleaning up...

685
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:50,472
and that's when I got the idea...

686
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,200
to propose to you.

687
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,138
So why today?

688
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,482
I don't know.

689
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,445
I just started thinking...

690
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,150
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you.

691
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,857
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

692
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,461
Promise?

693
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:32,014
Of course I'll marry you. I love you. Absolutely.

694
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,510
I love you. Yeah, let's get married!

695
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:37,519
Yes! Let's get married!

696
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:38,849
Come on!

697
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,283
I love you, too.
