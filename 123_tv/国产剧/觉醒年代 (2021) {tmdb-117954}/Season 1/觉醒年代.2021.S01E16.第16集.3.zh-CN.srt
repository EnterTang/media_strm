11
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,340
Every kid has that one movie to define their childhood.

12
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,590
Mine was the "The Goonies".

13
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,360
It has treasure hunting, pirate, kids on adventure,

14
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,640
and cool gadget build by Date.

15
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,660
I lived "Goonies." I breathed "Goonies."

16
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,020
I even did the truffle shuffle,

17
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,590
a dance made famous by Chunk, the lovable fat kid.

18
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,340
Mom!

19
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,310
- Is it silly dance time? - It's truffle shuffle.

20
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,200
You're ruining my moive.

21
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,100
I'm pretty sure I'm making it better.

22
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,260
She wasn't.

23
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,670
I was obsessed.

24
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,000
I wanted to live out every scene.

25
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,580
Down here it's our time.

26
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,190
It's our time down here!

27
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,050
All right, beat it, butthole. I rented "Weird science."

28
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,620
No! Stop! It's not over yet.

29
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,900
Let me tell you how it ends.

30
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,000
I punch you in the chest, you cry, roll end credits.

31
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,290
Adam! What the hell?

32
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,130
- Did you take my hair dryer? - Relax.

33
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,220
I think you're gonna be delighted

34
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,830
when you see what I've done with it.

35
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,280
- It's a goonie gadget. - Neat.

36
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,840
Let's see how this thing works.

37
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,310
Works well.

38
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,180
You owe me a hair dryer, you putz.

39
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,660
Great news.

40
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,260
There's a horrible smell coming from the attic,

41
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,440
and your mom wants me to figure out what it is.

42
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,670
How is that great news?

43
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,580
I got the brilliant idea to dump it off on you morons.

44
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,670
I'm 80% sure something's dead up there.

45
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,870
Go make some memories.

46
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll be there in a sec.

47
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,170
I'm just about to watch the good part.

48
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,090
Which is all of it.

49
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,580
You thinking what I'm thinking?

50
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,000
"How do toasters work"?

51
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,600
What? No. I have an idea.

52
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,900
Every time I went up into my attic,

53
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,550
I wished I'd find a treasure map,

54
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,970
just like in my favorite scene from "Goonies."

55
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,470
Unfortunately for me,

56
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,800
I'd mentioned that to Erica and Barry.

57
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,610
I didn't know mom and dad had this much crap up here.

58
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,020
Barry, when you drop something, pick it up.

59
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,340
What the?

60
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,560
It's an old map of Jenkintown.

61
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,460
Oh, that thing?

62
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,100
Mom bought that when the historical society shut down.

63
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,320
Oh, my god. It's signed by William Penn.

64
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,900
Why would the founder of Pennsylvania

65
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,580
sign a map of our town?

66
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,430
Because he died in this very neighborhood.

67
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,160
Yeah, and they never found his fortune. Who cares?

68
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,060
Come on. We have an attic to clean.

69
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,630
There's an "X" on this map, right in our own neighborhood.

70
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,090
An "X"? What does an "X" mark?

71
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,390
The spot.

72
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,630
Guys, there's treasure in this town,

73
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,010
And we're gonna find it.

74
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,990
Come on! Follow me!

75
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,480
I don't hear you running after me!

76
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,370
We should be running as a group.

77
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,530
You know, I like it when we work together as a team

78
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,680
to torture and humiliate our little brother.

79
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,930
Yeah. We should do more mean projects together.

80
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,420
It was February 22, 1980-something,

81
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,140
and the day began like most others for my grandpa.

82
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,300
Good morning, house of waffles! Belgian beauties on me!

83
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,670
Yep, breakfast for everyone,

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,350
But that's just who he was.

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,030
Pops' generosity knew no boundaries.

86
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,120
- Hey, Albert. Nice shirt. - You want it? It's yours.

87
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,690
No, no, I-I don't want the shirt.

88
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,480
Take it. Take the shirt.

89
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,550
All I said was the shirt was nice.

90
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,700
That was the thing about pops.

91
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,640
He'd literally give you the shirt off his back,

92
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,530
and we'd try not to take advantage of him,

93
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,730
most of the time.

94
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,730
Big news, everybody.

95
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,450
It's my half-birthday in two months.

96
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,200
Your half-birthday?

97
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,160
And you've just been sitting on that?

98
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,360
No, stop.

99
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,380
There is no such thing as a half-birthday.

100
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,930
Dad, take the money back.

101
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,860
Mom, leave him alone.

102
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,180
A handsome 60-year-old man

103
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,690
has the right to do whatever he wants.

104
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,010
You think I'm 60? Get over here.

105
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,090
And stop giving cash to the kids

106
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,240
every time they lie to you about your age.

107
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,280
Bevy, leave the man alone.

108
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,750
He's doing damn good for a 40-year-old.

109
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,940
This guy!

110
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,960
While pops was giving away his fortune,

111
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,930
I'd gathered my best friends to find some of our own.

112
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,460
What's going on? What are you nimrods up to?

113
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,760
Good, you're here. Now the treasure hunt can begin.

114
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,110
Here are the costumes to the characters you'll be assigned.

115
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,850
I, of course, will be Mikey, leader of the goonies.

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,060
That was both in reference to my character,

117
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,880
also to help my seasonal allergies.

118
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,200
Okay, let's keep this moving.

119
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,360
I've got some normal people to see later.

120
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,700
Erica, you'll be Stef, the unpleasant crab fisherman.

121
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,690
Dana, you'll be Andy, the cute cheerleader.

122
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,250
Aww, that's sweet.

123
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,780
- Get a room. - And for obvious reasons,

124
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,150
Emmy Mirsky, you'll be Mouth.

125
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,840
I know you're a girl, but I think of you like a dude.

126
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,390
And I think of you like a girl.

127
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,550
Okay! Really digging this outfit.

128
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,090
Tell me more about this clearly awesome badass.

129
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,280
You're my big brother. That makes you Brand.

130
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,480
Got it -- I'm Burt, the handsome surfer

131
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,920
who solves crimes at night, eh?

132
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,700
Close enough.

133
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,040
Chad Kremp, you'll play Chunk.

134
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,810
Stuff this pillow under your shirt

135
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,740
and munch on this baby ruth.

136
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,480
Um, can this be a granola bar?

137
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,420
My mom won't let me eat chocolate.

138
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,420
Oh, Chunk. Classic comic sidekick.

139
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,340
- Are we a team or what? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

140
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,580
Question -- which goonie am I?

141
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,020
Oh, yeah, Dave Kim.

142
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,550
Good question. Who's left?

143
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,960
Let's see.

144
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,380
Tough call.

145
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,170
Well, Brand is taken, so...

146
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,660
You wanted me to be Data.

147
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,010
What? No.

148
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,370
I just invited all of my closest friends over to hang out.

149
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,840
You've literally never invited me over before.

150
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,180
So you don't think we're friends.

151
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,980
That really stings, Dave Kim -- really stings.

152
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,430
But since you're here, you might as well wear

153
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
this elaborate gadget and trench coat.

154
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,730
Or I'll be Mikey.

155
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,480
- You want to be Mikey? Be Mikey. - Then I'm Mikey.

156
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,730
You can't be Mikey! Just put on the coat!

157
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,760
All right, goonies,

158
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,040
who's ready for the adventure of a lifetime?

159
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,290
This is it. I can feel it.

160
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,010
Some treasure hunt -- biking 10 feet across the street.

161
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,710
You're wrong, Dave Kim.

162
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,630
This is quite an adventure.

163
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,410
According to this map, this is the spot.

164
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,110
Okay, we got to look for anything out of the ordinary.

165
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,550
Look! That's a weird knot in the tree.

166
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,230
Seems strange.

167
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,080
Like I said, this is quite an adventure.

168
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,130
I told you this was real.

169
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,180
You guys ready?

170
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,490
'cause once I open this... everything changes.

171
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,760
It's a note.

172
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,210
It says...

173
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,680
Adam Goldberg is a giant nerd!"

174
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,920
Say "Cheese."

175
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,180
It's true. You're such a nerd.

176
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,360
I hate you guys!

177
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,950
Adam, come on.

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,280
It's not like we invited all of your friends.

179
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,880
But that did make it extra hilarious.

180
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,720
Go ahead, yuck it up.

181
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,520
Starting now, I don't have a brother and sister.

182
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,880
You're both dead to me.

183
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,650
- We should go. - Nobody tell my mom about the chocolate.

184
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,990
Shut up, Chunk.

185
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,770
Thanks, Adam.

186
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,190
This was fun...until the sad, embarrassing part.

187
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,860
Bye, Adam. See ya.

188
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,250
While my siblings were busy ruining my life,

189
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,220
Pops was living the high life.

190
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,270
So, what do you want to drink?

191
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,160
Red or white?

192
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,900
A martini. A little dirty.

193
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,100
I was hoping you'd say that.

194
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,320
Hello!

195
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,380
What?

196
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,160
D-did you break into my place?

197
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,470
No, I had a key made...

198
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,630
Which didn't work because you changed the locks,

199
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,770
so I had to crawl in through the window, so yes.

200
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,890
Who's this?

201
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,320
This is my daughter, who was just leaving.

202
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,250
Sorry. I'm not really interested in dating someone with kids.

203
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,480
Miriam, I swear she's on her way out.

204
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,640
- I had no idea how this -- - Bye-bye.

205
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,490
Bye.

206
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,720
Nice job. She was a sure thing.

207
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,650
Do you know how long --

208
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,260
Dad, we need to talk. Your finances are a mess.

209
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,370
Oh, please.

210
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,390
You're late paying your bills,

211
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,760
you've been forgetting to cash your checks,

212
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,420
and you've made some very questionable investments.

213
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,580
I believe in that alpaca farm.

214
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,290
The alpaca is the dog of the future.

215
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,030
Dad, I've got to take over your finances.

216
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,370
The hell you are.

217
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,510
It says here you closed

218
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,730
your safety deposit box five years ago.

219
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,970
I had a key. They had a key. It was crazy.

220
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,160
So where's mom's good jewelry? It was all in there.

221
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,120
- I gave it to you. - No, you didn't.

222
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,620
I clearly remember handing it directly to you.

223
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,030
You had a colorful sweater and big hair,

224
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,150
and you were on your way

225
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,750
to tell somebody how to run their life.

226
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,490
Okay, now you're just describing me on any given day.

227
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,870
So you remember it, too.

228
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,510
Fine. You want me to ransack my house from top to bottom?

229
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,340
I will.

230
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,580
But when I don't find that jewelry, I'm calling the shots.

231
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,890
How dare you?

232
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,770
I'm very responsible with my money.

233
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,650
You're using $10 bills as coasters.

234
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,480
I ran out of fives.

235
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,480
Meanwhile, it had been a week

236
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,940
since I spoke to my brother and sister,

237
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,200
and it was finally starting to get to them.

238
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,370
Hey, pal. You're looking good, strong.

239
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,350
What's that I hear, the wind?

240
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,490
Come on, Adam.

241
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,470
What do we got to do to stop being dead to you already?

242
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,130
You can start with an apology.

243
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,080
Okay, fine. We feel really bad.

244
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,170
For real, we're sorry.

245
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,250
I don't accept.

246
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,120
- You can't do that! - I just did.

247
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,370
Take the sorry.

248
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,480
I reject the sorry!

249
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,030
You asked for the sorry!

250
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,170
I asked for it so I could reject it.

251
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,540
You take the damn sorry! Take it now! Take it!

252
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,270
I take nothing!

253
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,510
He's not taking it.

254
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,570
So you're just gonna disown us? Unreal.

255
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,850
It's just a stupid, stupid movie.

256
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,450
Not to me. That movie is everything to me.

257
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,980
And you used it to embarrass me

258
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,280
in front of all my friends and Dave Kim!

259
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,330
Okay, we got caught up in the excitement

260
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,600
of crushing your little spirit.

261
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,670
But we'll figure out a way to even the score.

262
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,630
Trust me, I'm way ahead of you.

263
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,650
Erica Slater, that's gonna be my name

264
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,980
Erica Slater, unless you think it's lame

265
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:25,920
Then we'll change your name to Christian Go-o-ldberg

266
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,620
Adam! God! Get out!

267
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,170
What did you do?!

268
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,980
You embarrassed me in front of my friends,

269
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,140
so I sent this out to a few select people

270
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,510
so you'll know what it feels like.

271
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,740
- No! - Yes!

272
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,770
- No! - Yes!

273
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,400
That sucks, girl.

274
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:44,920
So we're good?

275
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,670
We sure are. I sent out a little workout video of you.

276
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,090
So? I look good when I work out.

277
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,040
- With mom. - That happened one time!

278
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,430
The one time I was filming it.

279
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,010
Dead! You're dead to me!

280
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,010
Doesn't matter, 'cause you're already dead to me!

281
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,410
Well, you're really dead to me!

282
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,740
Well, then that's settled.

283
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,280
We're all dead to each other.

284
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,610
Why would Christian Slater

285
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,580
change his last name to goldberg?

286
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,900
The search for my grandmother's missing jewels had begun.

287
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,230
And when Beverly Goldberg is on the hunt,

288
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,100
it's best to steer clear.

289
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,580
Okay, dad, I've looked everywhere down here.

290
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,730
No jewelry.

291
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,100
Now I'm heading upstairs

292
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,870
to start tearing apart the rest of the house,

293
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,990
unless you want to tell me something.

294
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,360
I want to tell you good luck.

295
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,520
I'm rooting for you, princess.

296
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,150
Unbelievable.

297
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,530
Albert, this is madness. She's killing both of us here.

298
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,230
How are you getting killed?

299
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,590
She's going through every nook and cranny of this house.

300
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,120
She already found my stash of cuban cigars.

301
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,930
She found my secret tin of multi-flavored popcorn --

302
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,240
Caramel, yellow cheese, white cheese.

303
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,500
- Ooh, I like the white cheese. - We all do.

304
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,770
Albert, you're not going to win,

305
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,900
so let's end this and get your finances in order.

306
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,530
Let me help you.

307
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,760
Here. I even made you a budget.

308
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,310
This is a cruel joke, right?

309
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,660
$200 a month for clothes? Are you nuts?

310
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,980
It's more than enough.

311
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,340
I wear silk. It costs me a fortune.

312
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,690
Little worms make it. Little worms make my clothes.

313
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,100
Well, then don't wear silk.

314
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,390
You're lucky I don't punch you in the face right now.

315
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,520
Fine, $300 for clothes,

316
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,950
but it's coming out of your food budget.

317
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,930
No way. It's already unreasonably low.

318
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,840
How can I buy waffles for an entire restaurant on $400?

319
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,700
- You can't. - Selfish son of bitch.

320
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,350
Okay, fine -- $500 for food,

321
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,320
but I am not budging on entertainment.

322
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,020
You only have me budgeted for three massages a week.

323
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,480
It's insanity.

324
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,640
Do you know why this skin is like butter?

325
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,770
'cause it's rubbed with butter.

326
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,170
A woman named Rhoda

327
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,980
comes to my house and rubs butter on me.

328
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,670
Now, do you want to deprive me and her

329
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,170
- of that experience? - Yes.

330
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,030
I am 100% positive I gave Beverly that jewelry,

331
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,370
and I'm outraged that you don't believe me -- outraged.

332
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,470
So, you've been lying to mom this whole time?

333
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,290
Pops, this is bad.

334
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,830
When mom finds out that you're the one

335
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,580
who forgot where you put the jewelry,

336
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,490
you'll be on a budget forever.

337
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,410
Rhoda will never butter you up again.

338
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,210
Not if we track down that jewelry.

339
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,050
I found this.

340
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,930
It's a list of nana's jewelry,

341
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,700
plus a little clue to help me remember where I put it.

342
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,530
"Irene's necklace, wedding ring, brooch, and gems.

343
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,230
Play this until it ends."

344
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,420
- It rhymes. - I like to make things fun.

345
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,200
- So what does the clue mean? - No clue.

346
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,990
You know what this is? A treasure hunt.

347
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,430
So you'll help me find it?

348
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,920
I vowed that my treasure-hunting days were over.

349
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,480
But for you, I'll come out of retirement.

350
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,950
Thanks for coming back.

351
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,650
I know how this is gonna sound,

352
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,210
but there actually is a bag of lost jewelry,

353
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,570
and it's up to us to find it.

354
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,620
Dude, this is getting kind of sad.

355
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,670
I'm serious. You're just gonna have to trust me on this.

356
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,830
All right, but I'm really not supposed to have chocolate.

357
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,220
We don't have to be goonies this time.

358
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,630
Oh, yeah? So what, then?

359
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,700
"Indiana Jones"? I got to be Short Round?

360
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,030
No, Dave Kim!

361
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,680
This isn't a movie. This is real life.

362
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,250
And I just really wanted my friends to help me.

363
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,400
So, what's the plan?

364
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,390
First, we need to get the rest of our team.

365
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,620
Hey, you guys.

366
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,560
Hey! Hey!

367
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,680
- We need your help. - No fricking way!

368
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,540
- Not after you sent out those humiliating tapes of us. - Yeah!

369
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,710
Everyone's making fun of me at school.

370
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,170
No one will sit next to me at lunch.

371
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,850
Girls are ignoring me.

372
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,250
- Dude, I didn't send out any tapes. - Say what?

373
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,230
I just said I did to make you guys mad.

374
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,380
No, no, you sent out tapes to everyone at school

375
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,950
and that girl who works at the orange julius at the mall.

376
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,970
I really didn't.

377
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,520
- No tapes. - No tapes?

378
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,010
- No tapes. - Well, I've got some stuff to think about.

379
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,250
And we're not helping you. Deal with it.

380
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,230
Wait.

381
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,920
Pops lost a bag of jewelry, and we need to find it.

382
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,320
Enough! I'm so tired of you and that stupid movie.

383
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,710
I know it's stupid.

384
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,090
Look, I know "The goonies" isn't for everybody.

385
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,690
I know if you got dropped on your head,

386
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,820
you wouldn't be a monster with wiggling ears.

387
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,640
I know a kid can't fall down a pit

388
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,820
and be saved by chattering teeth.

389
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,680
And I can't tell you why pirates would build a water slide.

390
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,360
But I still love "The goonies" 'cause it's about friends

391
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,690
working together to do something that really matters.

392
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,530
And this really matters.

393
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,930
You know why?

394
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,460
To quote "Goonies," It's our time.

395
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,310
It's our time down here.

396
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,830
Damn, that's a well-written movie.

397
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,920
And just like that, the real adventure had begun.

398
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,230
Okay, I've torn apart the house from top to bottom,

399
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,800
and I found some very questionable things --

400
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,500
Fireworks, throwing stars,

401
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,650
Barry's hidden lingerie catalogs,

402
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,470
Erica's wine coolers, Murray's ding dongs,

403
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,340
Murray's ho hos, Murray's tastykakes,

404
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,830
A machete -- don't know whose this is.

405
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,200
But you know what I didn't find?

406
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,480
Bevy, I know it's somewhere in this house.

407
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,140
Just give it another look-see.

408
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,230
And if you don't find it, I'll do whatever you want.

409
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,980
Fine. But this is the last time.

410
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,670
Come on, Adam. I need this.

411
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,200
We were back in the attic where it all began.

412
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,670
But this time, the treasure hunt was real,

413
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,420
and one man's buttery massages depended on it.

414
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,620
Wait. There's something here. Look, on the back.

415
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,690
This is part of a treble clef.

416
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,220
This has been ripped off the corner of some sheet music.

417
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,970
Sheet music? I saw some earlier.

418
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,150
Guys, I saw this book in a photo.

419
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,430
Look. It's pops and nana and the book.

420
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,650
"Play this until it ends." He means nana's piano.

421
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,300
It's in storage at dad's work.

422
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,750
We need to get his keys.

423
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,950
Guys, his pants at the door. Duh.

424
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,160
What the hell are you doing? Let's drive.

425
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,430
No, we're taking our bikes. It'll be fun.

427
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,490
It's all the way back there.

428
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,330
How are we gonna get to it? There's no way.

429
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,780
I've got this.

430
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,600
I'm super strong 'cause I've been working out.

431
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,260
- Yeah, with mom. - Not just with mom!

432
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:07,030
Move move. Get under me. Come on. Faster.

433
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,040
It was time to be a leader.

434
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,990
My friends had counted on me to get them this far,

435
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,550
and there was no turning back.

436
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,460
It was our time.

437
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,630
It's inside the piano.

438
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,880
Sure, it was just old-lady jewelry, but to us,

439
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,410
it was the greatest treasure we'd ever seen.

440
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,820
Unbelievable,

441
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,630
kiddo. You really did it.

442
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,660
Goldbergs never say die.

443
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,800
- What are you doing? - Hiding it for your mother to find.

444
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,840
You saw nothing.

445
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,240
Listen, pops.

446
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,130
I know mom's a pain, but this time, she was right.

447
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,900
Yeah, pops was stubborn.

448
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,660
But even he knew when it was time to admit he was wrong.

449
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,240
Dad.

450
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,460
I know. I'm sorry.

451
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,700
Okay.

452
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,600
What's this?

453
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,760
It's a little thank-you in advance

454
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,470
for helping me do my budget

455
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,810
and pay my bills and two years of back taxes.

456
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,340
It's a bit of a cluster Bleep.

457
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,530
Yes.

458
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:32,110
But I require no less than four messages a week. I'm not an animal.

459
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,750
That's the thing about family.

460
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,040
They may hate your movie

461
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,910
or disagree with how you spend your money.

462
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,890
But in the end, they are there with you

463
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,690
to eat some belgian beauties.

464
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,680
That was the first morning

465
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,280
Pops didn't buy the whole restaurant waffles,

466
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,040
just our family.

467
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,940
Hey, everybody!

468
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,690
Bloody Marys on me!

469
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,080
All right!

470
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,030
Technically, it was more expensive,

471
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,230
but it was a start.

472
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,590
Oh, there are my weights.

473
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,150
Go away. I'm using them.

474
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,160
Well, you're not using this one correctly.

475
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,690
Let me show you how to do it.

476
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,330
I don't need your help.

477
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,530
Yes, you do. And extend.

478
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,490
- I know what I'm doing. - And twist.

479
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,160
- Do you feel that? - Ooh, yeah.

480
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,290
This is what I like to call a rainy-day bike ride.

481
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,740
- It's working your abs... - Oh, my abs?

482
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,250
...and your quads and your hams and your shins.

483
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,450
So will it get rid of my baby fat?

484
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,860
- Okay. - Don't drop it on your face.

485
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,960
We're marching. We're in a parade.

486
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,960
Who's the leader of the band? Big tasty. Big tasty.

487
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,070
All right, I want you to be completely honest with me,

488
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,300
Dave Kim --

489
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,400
Mom or no mom,

490
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,830
my body's shaping up nice, am I right?

491
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,150
You people are weird.

495
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,840
Dave kim, your parents are out of town.

496
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,450
You're throwing a party. How is it going?

497
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,600
It's get a lot of...

498
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,000
but those worth it.
