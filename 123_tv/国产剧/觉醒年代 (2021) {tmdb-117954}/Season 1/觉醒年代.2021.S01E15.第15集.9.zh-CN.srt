11
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,010
Since the dawn of time, mothers and daughters have always fought.

12
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,920
10:00 is an embarrassing curfew.

13
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,060
Oh, it's embarrassing to tell your girlfriends 

14
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,220
you'd like to hang out at a safer time?

15
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,540
A lot. 

16
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,650
Absolutely not.

17
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,880
Doesn't matter what the topic is,

18
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,330
they'll find a way to disagree strongly and dramatically.

19
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,550
And when that runs its course,

20
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,600
they'll just lob insults at each other.

21
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,760
This house sucks!

22
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,790
It became the background noise of our lives.

23
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,150
And soon, it became weird when they weren't fighting.

24
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,720
There's nothing wrong with this outfit.

25
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,120
They keep it very hot in the gym.

26
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,040
It was a vicious, never-ending war.

27
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,140
All we knew was to keep

28
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,890
our heads low and out of the line of fire.

29
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,110
You're not going.

30
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,320
- But everyone is going! - In a nutshell, all of their fights

31
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,780
boiled down to one thing.

32
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,920
Ugh! Why can't you ever just trust me?!

33
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,500
I do trust you!

34
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,610
She didn't.

35
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,840
And to be fair, she didn't have any reason to.

36
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,920
No, Lainey, it's not hard to get wine coolers.

37
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,420
We'll just stand outside the liquor store

38
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,720
and target the creepy old dudes.

39
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,580
No!

40
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:50,870
Mom?

41
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,830
I picked up the phone by accident,

42
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,110
but I heard everything.

43
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,140
And then came the thing she lived to say.

44
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,970
I'm not mad, I'm just...disappointed.

45
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,190
Erica was smart and sneaky in her own right,

46
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,330
so my mom had to bring her "A" Game.

47
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,790
She read her diary...

48
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,960
And when she realized it was just a decoy

49
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,250
planted there for her to read,

50
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,170
she'd find her real diary.

51
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,390
And she wasn't afraid to get down and dirty

52
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,820
to find out what was going on even when nothing was going on.

53
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,390
No, you're still conjugating it wrong.

54
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,300
It's j'aime danser.

55
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,860
What's that sound?

56
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,580
I think it's...Snoring.

57
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,470
Seriously?

58
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,540
Nope.

59
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,990
I mean, if you're gonna spy, at least try to stay awake.

60
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,510
Well, in my defense, that was very boring.

61
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,660
It was February 6, 1980-something,

62
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,870
and while Erica was my mother's main focus,

63
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,980
she still had time to aggravate Barry, too.

64
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,790
I'm not exaggerating!

65
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,450
This is literally the worst decision

66
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,550
any parent has made on this planet

67
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,210
and any other planet capable of sustaining life.

68
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,310
You're not having a girl in your room, end of argument.

69
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,080
Lexy Bloom is just my lab partner.

70
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,480
All we're gonna do is study. We're just friends.

71
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,410
Okay. Then you can study right here at the table.

72
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,310
Here?

73
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,020
How am I supposed to impress her

74
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,260
with dad strolling around in his underpants?

75
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,200
Aha! You are trying to get romantic with her.

76
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,920
Of course I am!

77
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,480
Romance pumps in my veins.

78
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,900
Haven't you heard my rap ballad

79
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,210
about stone-cold grooving with a chick on a ferris wheel?

80
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,290
I have.

81
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,010
It was wonderful.

82
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,490
Not changing my mind.

83
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,500
This is such controversial bullcrap!

84
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,400
Adam has Emmy Mirsky in his room right now!

85
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,850
Oh, please.

86
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,330
Emmy Mirsky doesn't count.

87
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,610
They've been inseparable since they were in diapers.

88
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,050
He calls her muscles.

89
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,660
They're like brother and sister.

90
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,490
Really?

91
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,020
'Cause if you ask me,

92
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,700
that friendship is hardly as innocent as we think.

93
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,770
Ha! Busted!

94
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,650
Wait.

95
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,060
What are you doing?

96
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,690
It rained so we got worms, and now we're trying to see

97
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,820
who can keep them on their face the longest

98
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,270
without freaking out.

99
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,700
Well, that's sweet, guys.

100
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,390
We'll give you some privacy.

101
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,780
Ugh! Not fair!

102
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,520
What the hell was that about?

103
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,170
Something insane. I don't even question it anymore.

104
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,880
I've got to get these things off my face!

105
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,530
Yes! I win. You know what that means.

106
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,060
Ow! You punched me in my allergy shot.

107
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,690
Yep. This was my friend Emmy Mirsky.

108
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,640
She was a goofball and my wingman...

109
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,480
Or maybe I was hers.

110
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,580
"Top gun" five.

111
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,160
Later, Goose!

112
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,220
Whoa. I'm not Goose. You're Goose.

113
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,150
I'm Maverick.

115
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,240
Uh, wrong.

116
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,150
I'm Maverick because I look super-cool in aviator glasses,

117
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,590
which you can't wear because of your hilarious lazy eye.

118
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,380
My mom says I can get prescription shades,

119
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,780
so you can suck it!

120
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,300
Bead curtains.

121
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,740
That alone should have been enough to get me to turn around.

122
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,010
Hey. Re-dim that mood lighting.

123
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,340
What are you doing?

124
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,580
Trying to make it romantic in here,

125
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,920
like a french boudoir or Lee Majors' hot tub.

127
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,180
- Why? - 'cause Lexy Bloom 

128
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,280
can't step one foot into my room

129
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,390
even though Emmy sleeps over in your room

130
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,940
whenever her parents go out of town.

131
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,750
That's 'cause Emmy's not really a girl.

132
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,440
She's like a sibling except I like her.

133
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,570
Please.

134
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,990
It's just a matter of time before you two are making out.

135
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,170
Gross!

136
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,300
We're just friends.

137
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,920
Dude, you're so clueless.

138
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,750
Men and women can't be friends.

139
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,650
That's a fact. It's in the encyclopedia.

140
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,500
Look it up.

141
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,740
Why can't we be friends?

142
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,060
A little thing called sexual tension.

143
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,380
You and Emmy will happen.

144
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,250
Now, if you'll excuse me,

145
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,240
I have to finish setting the mood before Lexy arrives.

146
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,450
Whale sounds.

147
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,760
Ladies can't resist their haunting song.

148
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,770
Look it up.

149
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,640
I think you need a new encyclopedia.

150
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,410
Well, that was the most humiliating thing

151
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,060
I've ever been through in my life.

152
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,740
I'm the one who's humiliated.

153
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,410
You weren't sneaky at all. Everyone saw you, mom.

154
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,520
Saw me doing what? Loving my daughter?

155
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,180
Being a mom?

156
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,150
Hey! Enough!

157
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,490
You two can argue anywhere you like,

158
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,360
but "that's incredible!" is on, and there's a one-legged model.

159
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,150
I don't know how she's gonna walk the runway.

160
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,230
Murray, I don't want to hear

161
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,820
- about your stupid tv show right now. - Stupid?!

162
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,750
Is it stupid that a baby can water ski?

163
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,750
Is it stupid that someone taught rats to play basketball?

164
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,310
No, that's not stupid.

165
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,220
No, that's incredible!

166
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,570
I'll tell you what's stupid.

167
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,500
I can't go anywhere without my mother trying to ruin my life.

168
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,370
All I was doing was shopping at the same mall as you.

169
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,080
All of a sudden, that's a capital crime?

170
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,510
Why are you always following me?

171
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,420
I mean, what, exactly, do you think I'm up to?

172
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,580
I don't know. That's why I was following you.

173
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,520
So, you admit it!

174
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,580
Enough!

175
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,130
You two have to work out your crap

176
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,640
because it's exhausting.

177
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,190
Dad's right.

178
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,140
I'm heading off to college in two years.

179
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,640
Do you really want to leave it like this?

180
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,560
Of course not.

181
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,670
Then please just back off.

182
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,870
I need space!

183
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,960
I need...Trust.

184
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,840
Fine.

185
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,150
And she meant it...

186
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
Until the next time my sister left the house.

187
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,040
She went directly to the real diary,

188
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,680
and what she read would shake her to her very core.

189
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,190
Crack rock!

190
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,950
Crack rock!

191
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,310
Erica's gonna take crack rocks.

192
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,680
Erica what?

193
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,750
I read it in her diary --

194
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,870
Not the decoy, but the real one.

195
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,270
Her friends are participating in crack rock,

196
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,310
and now Erica is also going to participate in crack rock.

197
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,180
Can't you just trust Erica enough

198
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,440
to know that she's not gonna go out

199
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,500
- and eat crack with her friends? - No!

200
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,330
If my little baby so much as touches one piece of crack,

201
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,130
then I have failed as a mother.

202
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,180
You usually say that for dramatic effect,

203
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,860
but I agree with you on this one.

204
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,860
Hey. What's for dinner?

205
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,150
Dinner. Yes.

206
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,400
Funny you should ask that.

207
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,660
Um, come over here.

208
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,840
Come sit next to mama, baby.

209
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,520
- Are you crying? - No.

210
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,610
I hope you're hungry 'cause, uh, we are just gonna sit,

211
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,080
have a little chat.

212
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,900
Oh, look. Look what I have.

213
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,550
Do you know what this is?

214
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,820
An egg.

215
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,570
This is your brain.

216
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,580
This is drugs.

217
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,740
This is your brain on drugs.

218
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,600
Any questions?

219
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,150
Yeah, quite a few.

220
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,420
Uh, what the hell is happening?

221
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,040
Listen.

222
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,620
Your father and I have good reason

223
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,120
to believe that something is going to --

224
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,040
- Murray. - What?

225
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,130
That is a brain. That's not food.

226
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,180
And you -- I know everything 

227
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,750
'cause I read your real diary.

228
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,150
Well, there's one thing you don't know.

229
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,900
I only wrote that as a trap.

230
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,410
You wrote fake stuff in your real diary?

231
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,200
Yes, because I knew you would read it,

232
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,500
and I wanted to prove that you are incapable of trusting me.

233
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,680
Here's an idea.

234
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,130
Don't write your feelings down.

235
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,520
Shove them down into your body and forget about them like I do.

236
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,160
There's no downside.

237
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,840
You're not really gonna try the crack rock?

238
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,540
Of course not!

239
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,340
And the fact that you thought I would tells me everything.

240
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,510
Wait, honey.

241
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,520
Please don't be mad at me.

242
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,440
I'm not mad, just disappointed.

243
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,930
It had been a day since Barry told me

244
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,660
men and women can't be friends.

245
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,110
Even though I knew he was wrong,

246
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,460
I still found myself feeling kind of weird around Emmy.

247
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,080
Dude, you died already?

248
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,940
- What's the matter with you? - You play solo.

249
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,550
I'm not in the mood for "contra."

250
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,670
I'm gonna go grab a tastykake.

251
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,520
You want one?

252
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,660
Bring the whole box.

253
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,330
Pops!

254
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,420
Oh, thank god. I need you, man.

255
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,350
Really bad.

256
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,240
Ah, I know that desperate cry for help.

257
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,640
Lady trouble?

258
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,820
No.

259
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,080
Yes. I don't know.

260
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,550
So, then, yes.

261
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,230
Okay. Here's my question.

262
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,750
Can men and women be friends?

263
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,570
Oh, boy.

264
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,580
I thought you were gonna ask me

265
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,560
how to unhook a bra or something.

266
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,660
I'm all messed up.

267
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,060
Barry said Emmy and I have sexual tension.

268
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,430
I don't know what that is,

269
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,050
but I think I got it, and now things are totally weird.

270
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,880
You and muscles Mirsky?

271
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,590
You two are lifelong buds.

272
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,850
There's no way.

273
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,740
- You sure? - Of course.

274
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,050
Men and women can be friends.

275
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,050
Take me. I got plenty -- 

276
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,000
Gloria and Sheila and Mabel.

277
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:45,990
Wait.

278
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,090
Aren't all of those your ex-girlfriends?

279
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,820
Oh, yeah.

280
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,830
Well, they started out as friends, but I guess...Wait.

281
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,760
Rose Boykin. She's a friend.

282
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,140
So, you never once kissed her.

283
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,060
Once.

284
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,990
Maybe twice.

285
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,280
Maybe a lot more.

286
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,870
None of this helps me at all.

287
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,440
It's not my fault.

288
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,760
Women love me!

289
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,620
Here.

290
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,480
Let me show you how to do the bra thing.

291
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,230
Just name one female friend -- one.

292
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,560
Forget me.

293
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,380
I'm a lost cause.

294
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,640
But you love movies, right?

295
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,650
Go watch "When Harry met Sally."

296
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,900
It's all about how men and women can be friends.

297
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,650
I took pops' advice, and that night

298
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,580
we rented a movie about two besties like us.

299
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,180
- Oh, my god! - Oh, my god!

300
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,100
Unfortunately, pops hadn't quite remembered how it ended.

301
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,400
I have to go home now.

302
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,880
This is your home.

303
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,130
Then you have to go home now.

304
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,450
Yes, things were awkward in our house that week,

305
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,120
and not just between me and Emmy.

306
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,480
After my mom had accused Erica of participating in crack rock,

307
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,960
tension in our house was as thick as the ketchup

308
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,780
my mom was bathing our meatloaf in.

309
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,840
All right, that's enough. You've made your point.

310
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,640
I screwed up.

311
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,140
But I promise from now on, I will respect your privacy for real.

312
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,570
No more listening through the vent?

313
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,330
No more.

314
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,780
No more reading my diary?

315
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,920
Wouldn't dream of it.

316
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,960
I'm going to the movies tonight with Lainey.

317
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,400
Can you trust me?

318
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,840
I can trust you

319
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,370
if you can promise me that you can be trustworthy.

320
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,900
I promise.

321
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,980
I'm worthy of your trust.

322
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,030
I can't believe my mom trusted me!

323
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,720
Toga! Toga!

324
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,080
No, d-don't do that. 

325
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,640
As Erica was finally gonna live it up, I was breaking down.

326
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,520
Harry and Sally are lovers!

327
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,630
I'm pretty sure you're wrong about that.

328
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,310
Emmy and I just watched it.

329
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,180
And?

330
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,510
They end up together,

331
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,230
sucking on each other's faces like moray eels.

332
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,540
You know, come to think of it,

333
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,630
I saw that movie with my friend Miriam, and...

334
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
We just might have left early to...

335
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,810
Well, you don't need to know why we left early.

336
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,870
What do I do now?

337
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,090
How do I get things back to normal with Emmy?

338
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,540
You can't. The horse is out of the barn.

339
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,310
- What horse? - The horse that goes by the name of sexual tension.

340
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,390
And there's only one way to ease that tension.

341
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,020
By remaining friends and not addressing it?

342
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,160
You got to kiss her, see if there's sparks.

343
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,380
Me and Lexy Bloom are dealing with the same issue.

344
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,870
It's been tough. I'm not gonna lie.

345
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,350
What are you talking about?

346
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,010
She didn't even show up yesterday.

347
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,080
Yeah, 'cause she didn't trust herself around me.

348
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,960
Well, it's different with me and Emmy.

349
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,620
Pops, tell him he's nuts.

350
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,480
Kiddo, you just got to follow your heart.

351
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,630
What does that mean?

352
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,940
Tell me.

353
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,330
Do I kiss her or not?

354
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,380
I don't know.

355
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,630
You've asked the one question

356
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,500
that men and women have debated since the dawn of time.

357
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,220
Nobody knows, nobody on this planet.

358
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,190
I know.

359
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,260
It's kissing time, bro.

360
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,610
Bevy, you promised the girl.

361
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,800
Relax. I'm just tidying up.

362
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,230
Really? Wow. That's a big step.

363
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,080
I know. It feels good to finally trust her.

364
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,910
The fact that her sheet is missing from her bed

365
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,770
doesn't bother me at all.

366
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,830
Good.

367
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,330
Wait.

368
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,620
What does that have to do with anything?

369
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,530
Nothing.

370
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,810
I may have overheard her

371
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,080
talking about a fraternity toga party over at Villanova,

372
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,530
but I'm sure there's hundreds of other reasons

373
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,200
she would take a bedsheet to the movies with Lainey.

374
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,750
Oh, I know.

375
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,630
Maybe it was one of those movies

376
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,490
where they ask you to bring a sheet.

377
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,750
Those exist, right?

378
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,040
Oh, I see what you're trying to do.

379
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,480
You want me to suggest that we go out and track her down

380
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,270
so you can still look innocent.

381
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,710
Well, it's not going to work.

382
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,920
Your baby girl is at a college frat house

383
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,870
wearing a thin layer of bedding.

384
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,660
Holy...

385
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,890
let's go!

386
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,750
As much as I hated to admit it, I knew Barry was right.

387
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,940
Emmy and I had to kiss.

388
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,270
So I put on my best suit and braced myself for the worst.

389
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,480
Got your call. What's the emergency?

390
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,310
Why are you dressed like a game show host?

391
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,070
Please have a seat.

392
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,210
We need to chat.

393
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,070
I came all the way here to chat?

394
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,180
Why do we even have walkie-talkies?

395
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,160
Okay.

396
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,890
I know it's been weird between us,

397
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,430
but I know how to fix it.

398
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,750
We got to kiss.

399
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,650
What?

400
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,930
It's the only way.

401
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,320
We have to find out if there's sparks.

402
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,340
There aren't any sparks.

403
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,870
We don't know that!

404
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,100
You saw what happened to Harry and Sally.

405
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,120
We got to do this.

406
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,850
Fine.

407
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,290
- I'll give you a stupid kiss for one second. - Three seconds.

408
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,680
- Eyes open. - Eyes closed.

409
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,940
- Lights on. - Dimmed.

410
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,270
Don't touch my hair or face.

411
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,490
I'm not gonna touch you. Gross.

412
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,370
Thank you.

413
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,960
Let's do this.

414
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,590
Chiclet?

415
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,420
All right.

416
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,110
On the count of three.

417
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,590
One...

418
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,650
Two...

419
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,130
Nope! Can't do it!

420
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,690
We have to, Emmy.

421
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,160
It's the only way to know if we can still be friends.

422
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,530
I already know!

423
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,910
We're not friends anymore.

424
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,040
You ruined it.

425
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,630
I wasn't the only one having the worst night of their life.

426
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,870
Erica's toga party --

427
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,110
Not as awesome as she thought it would be.

428
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,200
Yo.

429
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,060
Me? 

430
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:40,910
Yo.

431
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,440
What's going on with your toga?

432
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,730
Oh, I accidentally took the fitted sheet.

433
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,020
What's a fitted sheet?

434
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,100
You know, the sheet at the bottom

435
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,520
with the elastic around it?

436
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,010
You have two sheets?

437
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,850
What kind of fancy house do you live in?

438
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,200
Hey, Kyle. We need you for the keg stands.

439
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,900
And, no, you're not invited, dorky high school girl.

440
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,110
I'm not in high school.

441
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,040
Oh, really? Name one professor at Villanova. Go.

442
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,970
Professor...Togerman.

443
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,920
Yeah. Why don't you take your fitted sheet and run on home?

444
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,190
How does everyone know about these special sheets?

445
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,430
Lainey.

446
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,250
Hey. Ox just invited me to his room to see his aquarium.

447
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,960
Way to go, high school!

448
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,930
As much as Erica hated

449
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,690
that my mom was always in her business,

450
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,710
at that moment, she sort of wished

451
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,260
Beverly was there to save her.

452
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,340
That feeling quickly faded.

453
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,560
Mom? What the hell?

454
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,920
No, you what the hell.

455
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,600
Get in the car right now!

456
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,680
Murray, calm down.

457
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,010
Just calm down.

458
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,580
Erica, get in the car!

459
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,030
So, this is what happens when I trust you, huh?

460
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,230
Guess who's disappointed now.

461
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,280
If you were gonna guess me, you'd be right.

462
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,180
And this is the reason why I feel the need

463
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,190
to keep such close watch over everything.

464
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,490
Are you crying?

465
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,370
Murray, take a walk.

466
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,810
But it's about to rain.

467
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,630
Take a walk.

468
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,600
You know who's disappointed?

469
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,620
Me.

470
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,100
Disappointed!

471
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,260
So, what happened?

472
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,560
It doesn't matter.

473
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,450
All I know is that you were right not to trust me.

474
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,950
But I do trust you.

475
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,640
No, you don't.

476
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,650
I don't.

477
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,810
You don't trust me

478
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,610
and I keep doing untrustworthy things

479
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,020
which makes you not trust me, and I'm so tired of it.

480
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,810
When is this gonna be any different?

481
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,290
Probably never.

482
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,630
My mom used to do the same thing to me,

483
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,870
and I swore I'd never do it to you, but here I am doing it.

484
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,740
But look on the bright side.

485
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,920
One day you'll have a daughter of your own not to trust.

486
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,890
Murray, let's go.

487
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,790
Give me a minute!

488
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,060
Some guy's gonna show me his aquarium.

489
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,440
While my mom was finally mending her relationship with Erica,

490
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,650
I was figuring out how to make up with Emmy.

491
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,570
I love that you get cold when it's 71 degrees out.

492
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,130
I love that it takes you an hour and a half

493
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,250
to order a sandwich.

494
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,250
I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose

495
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,750
when you're looking at me like I'm nuts.

496
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,730
And it was Harry who made me realize

497
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,610
exactly what I had to do.

498
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,370
What do you want?

499
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,340
Come here. We need to talk.

500
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,190
Emmy, I've been doing a lot of thinking,

501
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,640
and the thing is, I don't love you.

502
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,370
You mean it?

503
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,300
Look.

504
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,870
Sometimes, you meet a girl

505
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,280
and you just know that she's the one.

506
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,780
When you act like a wuss,

507
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,960
she's the one that punches you hard.

508
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,130
When you find a dead mouse, she's the one

509
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,110
that helps you hide it under Barry's pillow.

510
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,360
When you put too much confidence in a fart,

511
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,340
she's the one that helps you bury your underpants

512
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,690
in the woods behind the school.

513
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,960
She's your friend.

514
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,550
And you never, ever want to kiss her.

515
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,160
Want to go get some worms?

516
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,660
After that fateful night,

517
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,350
things got better for all of us Goldbergs.

518
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,820
There was a little less fighting...

519
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,490
...And a little more trust.

520
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,690
Why don't you two go study up in Barry's room?

521
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,480
There's less foot traffic.

522
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,110
Really?

523
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,380
Yeah, I'm not going up there.

524
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,740
And as for me and Emmy,

525
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,220
to this day, we're just friends.

526
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,390
Keep up, Goose.

527
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,510
I'm not Goose! I'm Maverick.

528
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,460
Sure you are, Goose.

530
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,570
Emmy Mirsky, best friend of Adam.

531
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,890
Move over!

532
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,740
You're not gonna show this to anyone,

533
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,620
- so I don't really care. - How do you know?

534
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,540
Okay. I helped Barry make his first music video.

535
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,370
Emmy, you're kind of a girl -- sort of.

536
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,510
You have to honestly tell me what you think.

537
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,480
* Hey, girl, you lookin' good up here where the air is *

538
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,260
* You 'n' big tasty on a wheel by ferris *

539
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,980
* Up and up we go, I know you gonna ask it *

540
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,900
* How we gettin' down from this sexy floatin' basket? *

541
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,570
* Stop at the top, is it just our luck? *

542
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,620
* Or did I tip that carny an extra 14 bucks? *

543
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,700
* Ferris wheel, ferris, ferris wheel *

544
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,870
* You know how I feel *

545
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,980
Whale break.

546
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,450
What do you think?

547
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
I'm gonna need 40 copies of this.

548
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,510
Yeah, you are!
