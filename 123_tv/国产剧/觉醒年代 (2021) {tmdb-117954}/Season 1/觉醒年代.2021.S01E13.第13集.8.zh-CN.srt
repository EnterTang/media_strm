11
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,430
Back in the '80s,

12
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,490
you couldn't keep up with all the new dance styles.

13
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,460
There was breakin', poppin' and lockin', the running man,

14
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,020
and something called the electric boogaloo.

15
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,500
Unfortunately, I had two left feet.

16
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,300
I often found walking a hard enough challenge.

17
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,720
You okay?

18
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,290
Me? Yeah.

19
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,770
Been working out a lot.

20
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,570
My quads locked up on me. That ever happen to you?

21
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,060
Um, no.

22
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,700
Das coo', das coo'.

23
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,610
Here you go.

24
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,690
Well, thanks for the help.

25
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,040
Hey, um, you going to the dance Friday?

26
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,090
- Are you going? - Yeah, maybe.

27
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,850
- Save me a dance? - Oh, definitely.

28
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,330
Sounds scrumptious.

29
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,900
Dana was amazing.

30
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,810
She wanted to dance with me, and she didn't care

31
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,770
that I used words like "Scrumptious."

32
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,410
Nothing was gonna bring me down.

33
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,680
Adam!

34
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,350
Hurry up! We're late for your dentist appointment!

35
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,980
Well, almost nothing.

36
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,420
Do you need to make...?

37
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,800
Make poo-poos?

38
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,250
I know you refuse to go at school,

39
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,870
but we don't have time to stop at home,

40
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,040
so if you have to make poo-poos, then make poo-poos here.

41
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,070
Oh, my god! I'm fine! Just let me in and let's go!

42
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,510
Well, first, tell me who that girl was.

43
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,540
What girl? There was no girl.

44
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,790
You were talking to Dana Caldwell.

45
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,110
Why do you ask me a question if you already know the answer?

46
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,170
Unlock the door!

47
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,850
What were you talking about?

48
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,460
- Nothing! - What were you talking about?

49
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,120
- Nothing! - Were you talking about the dance?

50
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,240
Tell me everything.

51
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,810
Let's just go to the dentist already!

52
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,520
- What were you talking about? - Oh, my god!

53
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,460
I'm the one kid in this world

54
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,400
who's looking forward to getting his teeth drilled.

55
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,860
Sheesh. All right, captain no fun.

56
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,450
With a smother like mine,

57
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,530
you have to shut her down fast.

58
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,220
You can't open the door, even a crack.

59
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,460
Drive!

60
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,820
So, then, Dana asked Adam if he was going to the dance,

61
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,230
and Adam said yes.

62
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,720
So, then, she said to save her a dance.

63
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,050
How do you know all this if you were in the car?

64
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,040
Sometimes a mother just knows.

65
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,630
And I trained myself to read lips a little bit.

66
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Huh. Read my lips.

67
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,600
You need help.

68
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,170
Murray, this is a big deal.

69
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,710
Our baby has his first girlfriend.

70
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,780
I think you know what that means.

71
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,120
- It's time for the talk. - What talk?

72
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,180
You know, about the birds and the bees

73
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,040
and what they do when they've had a couple of white wines

74
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,520
and put on a Lionel Richie record?

75
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,050
Yeah, that talk. Not for me.

76
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,990
Not for you? You're his father.

77
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,870
Just give him the same talk you gave Barry.

78
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,020
Ooh, here's the thing -- I never did that.

79
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,140
What?!

80
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,840
You were supposed to talk that talk with him

81
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,090
about three years ago!

82
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,620
I know. I know. What can I say?

83
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,510
- It got away from me. - Well, do it now.

84
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,250
What's the rush?

85
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,960
There's not, like, a line outside of his bedroom.

86
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,740
- Murray! - Fine!

87
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,130
No, you are a pain in my ass!

88
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,950
That's right. I read lips.

89
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,580
It was November 22, 1980-something,

90
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,560
and I was gonna learn to dance.

91
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,750
What do you mean you don't know how to dance?

92
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,040
You're my grandson.

93
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,860
You've got rhythm in your blood!

94
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,250
I'm an open book. Teach me.

95
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,440
As always, my grandfather would give me all the answers I needed.

96
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,690
He had never failed me before.

97
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,680
A-shuffle and a-cha!

98
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,560
A-shuffle and a-cha!

99
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,680
A-squibbidy bee, a-squibbidy boo!

100
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,700
A-squibbidy bee, a-squibbidy boo!

101
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,740
And we take a break 'cause my foot is swollen!

102
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,630
There was a first time for everything.

103
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,440
I had to find another teacher.

104
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,270
Erica, teach me to dance, and fast!

105
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,460
W-what did he say? Come on! Then what did he say?

106
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,820
Please! I need to learn how to move my body to music!

107
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,240
Lainey's in crisis.

108
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,780
Her parents bought her a new car and it's yellow!

109
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,000
What's the matter, litt buddy?

110
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,130
- Got a problem Barry can solve? - No.

111
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,310
- You'll just make fun of me. - What?

112
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,630
I would never do that.

113
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,970
Fine. I need someone to teach me how to dance.

114
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,180
Loser.

115
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,720
But you came to the right guy.

116
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,670
- But I'm not coming to you. - Let's do this.

117
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,500
When are you gonna start dancing?

118
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,630
Shut up!

119
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,110
My body's becoming one with the beat.

120
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,700
Airplane!

121
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,620
The wave!

122
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,230
Crab legs!

123
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,110
Helicopter!

124
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,660
And turtle spin!

125
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:40,940
Breakin'.

126
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,200
How does any of this help me?

127
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,100
I need to learn how to dance with a girl!

128
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,430
Yeah, I can't help you with that. But I can help you with this.

129
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,580
The worm!

130
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,640
After I got an ice pack for Barry's face,

131
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,230
I decided to teach myself how to dance

132
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,770
because time was running out.

133
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,030
Mm, get funky, snuggle monkey.

134
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,850
Wait, what? T-this isn't "The A-Team."

135
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,460
No, leave it on. We dance to that in jazzercize.

136
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,710
Maybe I was desperate, or maybe I was just hypnotized

137
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,370
by my mom's surprisingly sweet moves.

138
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,060
Mom...

139
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,590
Do you think you could teach me how to do that?

140
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,890
I let her in the door.

141
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,500
Get over here.

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,060
For the first time, my mother and I

143
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,720
were on the same team with the same goal.

144
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,170
There you go. Perfect.

145
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,590
And feel free to jazz it up with some head movements.

146
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,700
No one's gonna tell you you're moving your head too much.

147
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,080
Look -- we're kid 'n play!

148
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,870
John Travolta. There you go.

149
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,690
It was awesome...until this.

150
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,170
Well, this has been great. See ya!

151
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,450
Wait a minute, mister.

152
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,650
I'm not letting you go before I teach you how to slow dance.

153
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,170
No. No way. Not interested.

154
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,910
Sweetie, I know you better than anyone.

155
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,230
I know this is what's stressing you out --

156
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,430
Hand placement, where do you look,

157
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,300
How do you keep from stepping on her feet.

158
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,390
Those are all valid questions, yes.

159
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,720
I had come this far. I couldn't turn back now.

160
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,220
Screw it. Let's do this.

161
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,370
First, you, uh, put your hands on my waist.

162
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,540
- No, thank you. - Adam, I'm your mother.

163
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,930
That's the point!

164
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,620
Just rock back and forth, very gently.

165
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,080
Right...and left.

166
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,070
Right...left.

167
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,620
What are you doing?!

168
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,430
Ohh! No snuggies! No snuggies!

169
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,840
You smell like the dryer.

170
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,840
- No snuggies! - Honey, you're so yummy!

171
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,480
That's not cool. I'm out of here.

172
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,290
But thanks for the help!

173
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,800
And just to be clear, I know I'm yelling,

174
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,750
but I'm actually very appreciative!

175
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,210
While I was learning to dance,

176
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,530
my dad was ready to do some teaching of his own.

177
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
What are you doing?

178
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,200
Eating boo berry.

179
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,690
Good for you.

180
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,270
Very smart.

181
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,730
Feed your body.

182
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,650
So, your mom found out

183
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,750
that I never got around to giving you the talk.

184
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,600
What talk?

185
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,240
The..."people making people" Talk.

186
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,830
Ohh, that talk!

187
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,330
Exactly!

188
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,780
So, if she asks, tell her we just had it.

189
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,240
- But we didn't. - We don't need to.

190
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,400
I mean, you're a grown man, and you know everything.

191
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,610
- Of course! - Yeah!

192
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,180
I do have one question.

193
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,890
Is it true you can get a girl pregnant

194
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,260
if you french kiss her after midnight?

195
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,870
- What are you talking about? - Like in the movie "Gremlins."

196
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,040
If you kiss after midnight, the saliva goes into her tummy,

197
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,830
and 'cause of her hormones and the moon,

198
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,580
six weeks later, a baby comes out.

199
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,790
Gremlins?

200
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,590
You think -- how could you even --

201
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,490
Where are you going?

202
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,780
I got to regroup! I wasn't prepared for this!

203
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,030
I need to prepare.

204
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,570
Turns out, my dad's world wasn't the only one caving in.

205
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,580
Do you want the rad news or the totally rad news?

206
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,270
- Don't say "Rad." - I got these on sale and thought

207
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,130
they'd be perfect to wear to the dance.

208
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,090
- You like 'em? - They made a parachute into clothing!

209
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,550
Damn right, I like 'em!

210
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,150
And the even better news is

211
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,610
I will be joining you at the dance!

212
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,310
- What?! - I know!

213
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,300
I signed up to be a chaperone.

214
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,750
That way, I'll be there to help with your moves.

215
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,570
I don't need help. Don't help me.

216
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,940
All kids are embarrassed by their parents.

217
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,420
But don't think of me as your mom.

218
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,940
Think of me as your coach.

219
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,280
I don't want to think of you at all

220
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,310
when I'm dancing with Dana.

221
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,870
You won't even know I'm there.

222
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,680
And if I'm lucky, I'll get to see

223
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,380
my little baby have his first slow dance!

224
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,020
I'd done the unthinkable.

225
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,930
I opened the door, and my mom had burst right through it!

226
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,920
What did he say?

227
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,640
Have you lost your mind?!

228
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,860
I slow-danced with mom!

229
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,470
- What? - You heard me.

230
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,450
What do you mean? What are you saying?

231
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,480
I...slow-danced... with mom.

232
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,990
You slow-danced with mom?

233
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,570
- This doesn't concern you! - The hell it doesn't!

234
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,410
You can't go slow-dancing with mom

235
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,270
and not expect me to have lots of opinions

236
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,580
on this controversial matter.

237
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,510
It was a moment of weakness, and she taught me how to dance,

238
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,910
and now she's gonna be a chaperone tonight

239
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,340
and totally humiliate me!

240
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,310
- Now you've opened the door. - I know.

241
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,090
Just tell me how to close it.

242
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,300
There is no way!

243
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,510
Once the door's open, it stays open forever!

244
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,130
I sent her a letter from camp saying I was homesick.

245
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,460
and the next night, she showed up in the top bunk.

246
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,380
Look, this is a picture of us in a canoe together!

247
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,600
Never again, Adam. Never again!

248
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,600
This is all so upsetting.

249
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,740
I got to go. I can't be here.

250
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,610
Okay. There's got to be a way out of this.

251
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,730
Yes! Lies and deception -- that's your department.

252
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,770
I'll think of something -- I promise.

253
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,390
- I love you. - Don't say that.

254
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,620
Look into my eyes and know that I...love...you.

255
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,050
Get out!

256
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,040
Love you!

257
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,570
Again with the boo berry.

258
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,490
You know it.

259
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,610
All right.

260
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,920
Here we go. Time for the talk.

261
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,760
All right, before we get down to the nuts and bolts...

262
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,350
Nuts.

263
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,850
All right, instead of talking about

264
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,360
male and female body parts, we're gonna use the names

265
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,670
of our favorite baseball players as code words.

266
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,610
Look, you have a Mike Schmidt.

267
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,170
Ladies have a Wade Boggs.

268
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,000
And... why are we doing this?

269
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,570
This way, we won't be talking about anything horrible.

270
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,430
We're just gonna be talking about baseball --

271
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,010
Like, when a man loves a woman,

272
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,940
Mike Schmidt steps up to the plate against Wade Boggs.

273
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,040
Wade Boggs plays third. Why is he pitching?

274
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,080
Fine! Wade Boggs is now Steve Carlton.

275
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,140
Steve? That's clearly a dude's name.

276
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,010
Okay, the girl's parts are gonna be, uh, Bo Jackson.

277
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,300
- That makes no sense. - Bo's a girl's name!

278
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,740
It's wintertime.

279
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,710
That's when Bo Jackson plays football.

280
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,890
He'd never be on the same field as Mike Schmidt.

281
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,040
I never thought that I would ever say this to you,

282
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,410
but you're over-thinking this, you moron.

283
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,620
I'm a moron?

284
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,480
Well, you're a Mike Schmidt!

285
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,160
- Take that back! - Never!

287
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,270
Get your head out of your Orel Hershiser

288
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,250
and come back here right now!

289
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,110
For what it's worth,

290
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,480
I found that whole baseball thing very confusing.

291
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,250
- That bad, huh? - It was bad.

292
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,940
What kind of 16-year-old boy doesn't even know

293
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,560
the basics of the birds and the bees?

294
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,760
Murray, he knows everything.

295
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,430
I gave him the talk three years ago when you dropped the ball.

296
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,460
He's just messing with you.

297
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,830
So he wants a sex talk, huh?

298
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,470
Well, I'm gonna give him a sex talk, but good.

299
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,670
Or, instead of trying to spite him,

300
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,850
you actually have a real conversation about it,

301
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,780
which would mean the world to him.

302
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,290
No, I'm gonna go with my thing.

303
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,010
As my dad was putting his plan into motion,

304
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,750
I was praying Erica was, as well.

305
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,030
Oh, balls.

306
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,980
Hey, boopie. Look what mama bought.

307
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,930
Now we're parachute pals.

308
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,130
No! That's not a thing. Take 'em off.

309
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,910
- I paid for the pants. - Don't wear the pants.

310
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,100
- I'm wearing the pants. - Don't wear the pants.

311
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,700
- Hey, mom? - Oh, look, it's Erica.

312
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,400
Check out this box of old photos that I found in the basement.

313
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,120
Man, such good memories.

314
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,270
We should, like, organize these in some sort of way.

315
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,090
Maybe in, like, a book? That would be fun.

316
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,110
Holy Erica.

317
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,470
I have been begging you

318
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,910
to make a scrapbook with me for years!

319
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,180
- Well, let's make it right now. - Oh, now?

320
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,950
God, no. I've got to chaperone Adam's dance tonight.

321
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,700
Tomorrow morning, we'll wake up at dawn

322
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,790
and really hit it hard.

323
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,900
What do you say?

324
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,780
Eh... I'm kind of losing interest.

325
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,120
Oh, no, no. Don't lose interest.

326
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,260
Um...I can do both.

327
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,730
Adam, I'll meet you at the dance.

328
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,970
Erica, don't move.

329
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,030
I'm just gonna run upstairs and get my smock and glue gun.

330
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,420
There's 1,000 pictures in this box.

331
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,640
There's no way she's gonna make it to that dance.

332
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,830
Have I mentioned that I love you?

333
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,010
Say it one more time, and I won't help you.

334
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,190
Erica had actually pulled it off.

335
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,520
My mom was gonna be stuck home all night!

336
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,670
All right, got our cocoa.

337
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,870
Let's cozy up and spend the next few hours

338
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,900
reliving my entire life.

339
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,570
And...done!

340
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,120
What? How did you do this?

341
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,300
Please, I've had this whole thing

342
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,230
mapped out in my mind for years.

343
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,440
You...pressed flowers...

344
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,110
And put my favorite music lyrics beneath each photo.

345
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,640
Take some time with it.

346
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,520
It's like a beautiful kaleidoscope of my life.

347
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,040
Yeah, touching stuff.

348
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,940
Now, I've got to get to that dance.

349
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,810
The jam's not gonna pump itself up.

350
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,660
While Erica's plan had failed,

351
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,930
My dad was giving his one more shot.

352
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,470
Hey, uh, Bar, you got a sec?

353
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,840
I think we should have a talk, man to man.

354
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,300
Really? Okay.

355
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,420
I've never been a great communicator,

356
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,230
so I think I should keep things as direct and exact as possible.

357
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,020
- All right. - So, we're not just gonna have the talk.

358
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,760
We're gonna experience the talk.

359
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,230
We're gonna do some role-playing.

360
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,720
I'm gonna be the girl. You'll be the boy.

361
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,040
And we're gonna learn where babies come from with our hands.

362
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,900
- Take a Fraggle. - I don't want the Fraggle.

363
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,820
I'm a pretty Fraggle girl.

364
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,950
Would you like to come up to my condo for a nightcap?

365
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,620
I've been so lonely since I put myself through nursing school.

366
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,280
Fraggles don't own condos!

367
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,060
Take it. Put your hand in the Fraggle.

368
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,050
Keep the Fraggle away from me!

369
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,060
- Take it now! - Stop it! I was messing with you!

370
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,810
I know everything, okay?

371
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,290
I know you know everything.

372
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,890
Then why are you torturing me?

373
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,500
Because you tortured me!

374
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,620
What kind of moron makes their dad

375
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,850
give them the talk when they don't need the talk?

376
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,390
- Who does that? - Me.

377
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,050
And you know why?

378
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,620
'cause you couldn't be bothered

379
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,040
to have the talk when I actually needed it.

380
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,350
Dads are supposed to teach their kids stuff --

381
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,530
How to throw a fastball and change a tire and shave.

382
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,040
You never taught me anything.

383
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,600
In my defense, I-I-I know very little.

384
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,800
And Fraggles -- they can't be nurses.

386
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,340
They dance their cares away.

387
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,800
As my dad was striking out at home,

388
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,120
I was ready to hit the dance floor at school.

389
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,110
The only problem was that at a junior-high dance,

390
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,850
kids don't dance, but that didn't matter.

391
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,170
With my mom distracted by Erica at home,

392
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,720
it was time for me to show Dana my awesome moves.

393
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,180
May I have this dance?

394
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,240
Kidding -- I'm just here to chaperone.

395
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,070
Unless you're bored. Then let's boogie.

396
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,980
What are you doing here?!

397
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,330
I told you I'd make it.

398
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,600
Now I'm gonna need you to leave.

399
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,660
Will you stop with that?

400
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,380
I really want to be here at this dance.

401
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,600
You can't deny me that pleasure, Adam.

402
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,760
Go away!

403
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,680
But you're the one who asked me to teach you how to dance.

404
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,880
It was a mistake.

405
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,830
I asked for your help in a moment of weakness.

406
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,470
It'll never happen again.

407
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,830
Okay. I guess I'll just go then.

408
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,300
The sound of those swishing parachute pants running away

409
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,920
was the sound of victory.

410
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,190
So, then, why did I feel so bad?

411
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,800
Even though I was forced

412
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,780
to hurt my mom in the name of love,

413
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,330
I had to forge on.

414
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,600
I'd charm Dana with a cup of hawaiian punch

415
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,140
and then make my move.

416
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,890
Dana. Hey.

417
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,820
- Want some punch? - No, I'm just gonna go

418
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,200
hang outside until my mom dances herself out.

419
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,040
I didn't know your mom was a chaperone.

420
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,490
Yeah, and she went out for margaritas

421
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,420
with the other moms before the dance.

422
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,800
It's so humiliating.

423
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,310
Turns out, my mom was right about one thing --

424
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,930
- Every kid is embarrassed by their parents. - Mom!

425
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,070
- And it gave me an idea. - Mom!

426
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,840
Don't worry. I'm just leaving.

427
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,560
No. I need your help.

428
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,740
Oh, no. You don't get my help.

429
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,760
Not after you said you're never gonna ask for it again.

430
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,580
- That's not how this works. - I'm sorry, okay?

431
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,510
Sometimes, I need your help.

432
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,900
But sometimes, I just want you gone.

433
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,690
Well, that's confusing!

434
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,790
I know. It makes no sense.

435
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,270
But for now, that's just how it's gonna be.

436
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,670
So, what do you want?

437
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,550
I want you to go on that dance floor

438
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,830
and just...be yourself.

439
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,920
I can do that.

440
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,640
Well, what do you know?

441
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,420
No one's looking at your mom anymore.

442
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,070
- Did you do that for me? - Well, I definitely didn't do it for me.

443
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,200
My plan had worked.

444
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,710
I'd saved Dana,

445
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,880
but I couldn't have predicted what happened next.

446
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,360
My mom actually got

447
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,980
Junior-high-school kids to dance...

448
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,340
And it was epic.

449
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,710
Come on! I like the fast ones!

450
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,690
You know what? I'm gonna go out

451
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,690
and get some fresh air. Why don't you come with me?

452
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,480
Have fun, baby.

453
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,930
Normally, we don't say "I love you" in our family.

454
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,060
Luckily for me, my mom could read lips.

455
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,100
Want some company?

456
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,410
I am a terrible father.

457
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,360
I'll take that as a yes.

458
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,160
I don't even know how to talk to my kids.

459
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,230
I'm aware.

460
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,150
I always thought that I would do

461
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,590
everything different than my dad did.

462
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,390
And look at me -- I'm just like him.

463
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,790
Murray, you're nothing like him.

464
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,630
What are you talking about?

465
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,430
We both look alike.

466
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,250
We both scream all the time.

467
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,510
We both walk around in our underwear.

468
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,930
But your dad would never

469
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,130
be out here right now, feeling like this.

470
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,530
And that's why you're different.

471
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,860
As for my dad, he'd never be a good communicator.

472
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,020
Damn it!

473
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,230
Has anyone seen the bottle opener?

474
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,990
But he was still able to teach yoa few things.

475
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,230
Here. Let me show you something.

476
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,600
Little party trick. The ladies love it.

477
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,930
Not bad.

478
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,150
Don't just stand there.

479
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,240
Go get another one, and I'll show you how.

480
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,410
That night, I learned that some events

481
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,600
can't be captured in a scrapbook.

482
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,580
You just got to be there and witness them yourself.

483
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,710
Mrs. Goldberg.

484
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,830
Mrs. Goldberg!

485
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,100
It's time to go home.

486
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,990
Mm, dances don't really end,

487
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,680
and the invitation for this one said,

488
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,500
"6:00 to question mark," So...

489
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,660
That was a 9.

490
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,550
Okay, well, that was just rude.
