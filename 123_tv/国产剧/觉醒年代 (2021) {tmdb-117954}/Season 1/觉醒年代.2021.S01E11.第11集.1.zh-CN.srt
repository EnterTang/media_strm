11
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,710
八十年代  對所有青春期的男生來說
In the '80s, a defining moment

12
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,430
一個關鍵性時刻  就是看《空手道小子》
for every teenage boys was seeing "The Karate Kid".

13
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,040
這部電影在我們的心上拳打腳踢
It kicked and punched and swept the

14
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,250
再加個掃堂腿
leg of our hearts.

15
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,750
沒人比我哥巴瑞更愛這部電影
No one loved it more than my brother Barry.

16
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,490
上吧
Come at me!

17
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,360
上截  蛇形
High block! Cobra strike!

18
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,020
向左虛晃  向右  忍者打滾
Fake left, go right. Ninja roll!

19
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,330
沒事  我沒事
It's okay. I'm okay.

20
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,890
現在來個掌劈
Now throw a chop!

21
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,460
我截住了掌劈
I block that chop!

22
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,310
回擊  高踢  憤怒之拳
I retaliate! High kick! Fist of fury!

23
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,610
致命一擊
Death blow!

24
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,950
我在想
Hmm, you know, I was thinking--

25
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,110
你不把招數先說出來會好些吧
It might be better if you didn't call out your moves first.

26
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,310
好主意
That's a great idea.

27
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,370
偷襲
Sneak attack!

28
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,120
當然  我哥自認為技藝高超
Sure, my big bro had an inflated sense of skill,

29
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,990
但在我家  把他吹上天的是我媽
but in my house, my mother was the one who did the inflating.

30
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,300
她戴著我們所謂的"母親護目鏡"
She wore something we called "mom goggles."

31
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,410
這讓她覺得我們做的事
They made everything we did

32
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,550
不是好  而是好到爆
not just good, but spectacular.

33
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,710
瞧你  我的小功夫大師
Oh, look at you, my little kung fu master!

34
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,420
這不是功夫  停下
It's not kung fu. Stop!

35
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,640
這是空手道
I do kara-te.

36
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,190
功夫加上空手道  而且好危險
Bilingual and dangerous?

37
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,810
你真是太厲害了  寶貝
Oh, you are just off-the-charts amazing, honey.

38
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,550
大多數孩子會無視母親的表揚
Most kids ignore their mom's high praise...

39
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,300
但巴瑞不是大多數孩子
But Barry wasn't most kids.

40
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,670
他真的相信老媽那些天花亂墜的話
He really believed the hype.

41
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,730
遺憾的是  面對女生時  他的自信
Unfortunately, that confidence did not translate

42
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,560
無法變為行動
to his moves with the ladies.

43
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,560
你好
Hi?

44
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,780
好啊
Yo.

45
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,190
橫劈儲物柜
Locker strike!

46
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,900
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

47
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,570
我很好  我的手像石頭一樣堅硬
I'm fine. My hands are like rocks.

48
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,340
但同時很柔軟  又溫柔
But they're soft, too. And gentle.

49
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,580
像鴨寶寶一樣
Like baby ducks.

50
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,190
-怪人  -好了  孩子們
- Weird. - All right, kids!

51
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,740
又到了這個時候了
That time of year again.

52
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,740
假日才藝表演  怎么樣
Holiday talent show. Eh?

53
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,840
有人嗎
Nobody?

54
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,230
老天  我愛死才藝表演了
Oh, my god, I love the talent show.

55
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,180
是真的嗎
Oh, do ya now?

56
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,360
是真的嗎
Do ya now?

57
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,460
怪人
Weird.

58
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,260
你真好
You're great.

59
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,500
回頭見
See ya later.

60
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,440
巴瑞有了計劃
Barry had a plan in motion,

61
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,360
當晚  他實施了計劃
and that night, he put it into action.

62
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,190
晚上好
Good evening.

63
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,190
很高興大家今晚都在
Glad you could all make it tonight.

64
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,370
-什么意思  -重大消息要宣布
- What--what is this? - Big announcement.

65
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,260
我決定在學校的才藝表演上
I've decided to do a kara-teroutine

66
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,610
來一段空手道
at the school talent show.

67
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,870
面試在明天
Auditions are tomorrow.

68
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,380
我不想說得太過夸張
Now I don't want to make too big a deal out of this,

69
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,620
但我相信  這將是有史以來
but I do believe it will be the greatest moment

70
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,120
最偉大的時刻
in the history of everything.

71
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,520
我的天  這主意太棒了
Oh, my goodness! What a wonderful idea!

72
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,630
默里  這是不是非常棒的主意
Murray, isn't this a wonderful idea?

73
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,500
如果我同意  是否能不再發表意見了
If I say yes, can I be out of the conversation?

74
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,260
那你呢  愛麗卡
What about you, Erica?

75
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,010
你一定得去參加這個才藝表演
You should absolutely do this talent thing.

76
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,010
我聽到你在沖澡時唱佩特·貝納通的歌
I've heard you singing Pat Benetton in the shower.

77
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,360
放心吧  我會去參加才藝表演的
Don't worry, guys. I'll be at the talent show--

78
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,680
坐在第一排
In the front row.

79
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,700
因為我和朋友們總是喜歡大笑一場
'Cause my friends and I always go for a good laugh.

80
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,020
去吧  帶上你所有的漂亮朋友
Go ahead! Bring all your hot friends.

81
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,520
我會用絕招讓她們高聲喝彩的
I'll wow 'em with my moves.

82
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,840
亞當  沖我的臉上扔個餐包
Now, Adam, chuck a dinner roll at my face.

83
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,520
看著我把它劈開  來吧
Watch me deflect it. Come on.

84
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,130
不  不是這樣  溫柔一點
No. No. Not like that. Gentle.

85
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,950
別打我的臉  如果你可以...
And don't hit me in the face if you can--

86
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,860
-不  你在做什么  -溫柔些
- No--what are doing?! - Gently.

87
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,630
-讓我準備好  來吧  -住手
- Let me get ready, okay? Come on. - Stop it!

88
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,200
太棒了
Yes!

89
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,370
-搞什么  -像閃電一樣  我愛閃電
- What the hell? - Like lightning! I'm like lightning!

90
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,400
我知道你可以的  我知道你可以的
I knew you could do it! I knew you could do it!

91
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,050
那是一九八幾年的12月9日
It was December 9th, 1980-something,

92
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,820
巴瑞的假日好心情完全不見蹤影
and Barry's holiday cheer was nowhere in sight.

93
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,730
這一切有什么意義
What's the point of anything?!

94
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,550
冷靜  慢著  出什么事了
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. What's wrong?

95
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,730
-才藝表演不要我  -我不明白
- I didn't get into the talent show. - I don't understand.

96
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,870
-他們拒絕了我  -完全沒道理
- They rejected me. - That literally makes no sense.

97
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,240
面試的人  除了我全選上了
Everyone who auditioned got in but me.

98
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,240
我聽到你的話了
I hear what you're saying,

99
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,840
但我完全沒聽明白
but I cannot wrap my mind around that.

100
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,240
格拉斯科特老師說我的表演太不合適了
Mr. Glascott said my routine was too inappropriate.

101
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,250
做一個完美的空手道天使是怎么不合適了
How is being a perfect kara-te angel inappropriate?

102
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,250
巴瑞  我想過了
Barry! Okay, I have been thinking.

103
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,870
你的空手道表演
Your kara-te routine--

104
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,380
需要專業的導演
It needs a professional director.

105
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,700
就是我  創意無限的人
That's me! A big idea guy.

106
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,560
而且  我看過太多空手道電影了
Plus, I've seen a million karate movies.

107
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,800
你在哭嗎
Are you crying?

108
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,060
沒有  沒有
No. No!

109
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,070
這是勇士的眼淚  沒關系了
They're warrior's tears, and it doesn't matter!

110
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,310
學校說不行
The school said no!

111
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,140
我永遠不會出蛇形了
I'll never cobra strike again!

112
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,650
真不公平
This isn't fair!

113
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,810
在那一刻  我媽媽的腦子里
At that moment, there was only one thing

114
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,690
只有一個主意
running through my mom's mind.

115
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,170
沒人有資格告訴我的寶貝  他不能出蛇形
No one tells my baby he can't cobra strike.

116
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,090
格拉斯科特老師
Mr. Glascott!

117
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,930
我需要現在和你談談
I need to speak to you immediately.

118
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,030
不好意思  我和數學俱樂部的孩子
Oh, I'm sorry. I have an important morning meeting

119
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,240
有個重要的早會
with the kids from the math club.

120
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,330
書呆子可以等等
The nerds can wait.

121
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,830
我兒子巴瑞·金伯格等不了
My son--Barry Goldberg--cannot.

122
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,090
你是  貝弗莉·金伯格嗎
Are you... Beverly Goldberg?

123
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,340
正是在下
Oh, yes, I am.

124
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,840
告訴我  什么樣的教育工作者
Tell me, what kind of educator

125
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,340
會踐踏學生的夢想
stomps on the dreams of his students?

126
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,060
巴瑞是個好孩子
Look, Barry's a good kid,

127
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,470
所以我才勸他不要
which is kinda why I discouraged him

128
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,010
參加才藝表演
from taking part in the show.

129
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,350
這里有些萬千寵愛在一身的學生
See, some of the more high-profile students here

130
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,610
是非常苛刻的  你懂吧
can be very critical, if you follow me.

131
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,620
真不懂
I really don't.

132
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,120
這里出風頭的孩子都是混蛋
The popular kids here are real douche-sacks.

133
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,630
去年  有個孩子表演了一段不錯的腹語
Last year, one kid did a lovely ventriloquist act.

134
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,370
那些孩子  他們在表演后對腹語木偶
The kids--well, they did unspeakable things

135
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,870
做了些我說不出口的事
to that doll after the show.

136
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,010
說實話  非常的過分
Quite frankly, it was very jarring.

137
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,040
巴瑞的空手道表演
And Barry's karate is really ripe

138
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,980
正是他們嘲弄的對象
for that type of ridicule.

139
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,030
這里是高中  不是《搜尋明日之星》
Uh, this is high school, not "Star Search."

140
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,700
{\an8}[著名節目主持人]

141
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,700
誰死了你才坐上麥克馬洪的位置
I mean, who died and made you Ed Mcmahon?

142
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,060
約翰遜老師  我們的體育老師
Mr. Johansson. Our gym teacher.

143
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,010
他去世了
He died.

144
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,880
這不重要  巴瑞要上表演
Yeah, it doesn't matter. Barry is doing that show.

145
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,890
我會不計一切代價
I will go to the top on this.

146
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,890
我會向校長請愿  還有學校董事會
I'll petition the principal, the school board,

147
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,890
監管人  市長辦公室
the superintendent, the mayor's office,

148
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,890
萬不得已  教育部部長
the U.S. Secretary of education if I have to.

149
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,590
怎么樣  安德魯
So what's it gonna be, Andre?

150
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,160
你知道我的名字
You know my name.

151
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,790
我什么都知道
I know everything.

152
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,180
我被選上參加才藝表演了
I got into the talent show!

153
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,410
好消息  我好意外
That's good news, and very surprising to me.

154
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,910
格拉斯科特老師說三州才藝表演委員會
Mr. Glascott said the tri-state talent show committee

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,910
開會裁決空手道是一種藝術形式
met and ruled that kara-te is an art form.

156
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,660
三州才藝表演委員會會議
Wow, the tri-state talent show committee met.

157
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,000
幾乎令人無法相信啊
You know, that's almost unbelievable!

158
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,680
這是事實  別再糾結了
Well, it happened, so let's just move on.

159
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,150
我們又回來了
Oh, man, we're back in business!

160
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,500
快做正經事
Let's get to work!

161
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,780
我去拿雙節棍和爆竹
I'll go get my nunchucks and firecrackers.

162
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,480
不準用爆竹
No firecrackers!

163
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,430
這么說  你威脅了一位老師
So... You threatened a teacher?

164
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,720
拜托  我只是客氣地建議
Please. I just gently suggested

165
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,810
他照我說的做
that he do what I say,

166
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,530
否則會有可怕的后果
or there'd be dire consequences.

167
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,620
為什么每次咱家孩子在學校不順心
Why is it you go trotting down to the school

168
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,730
你就要殺到學校去
and yell at somebody every time one of our kids

169
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,740
把某人吼一頓
doesn't get their way?

170
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,790
我關心他們的成長  這是好事
I'm involved. That's a good thing.

171
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,480
-你失控了  -我別無選擇  默里
- You are out of control! - I had no choice, Murray.

172
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,420
你見過巴瑞玩空手道嗎
Have you even seen Barry do kara-te?

173
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,180
就像是美麗的芭蕾
It's like a beautiful ballet,

174
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,110
只是途中不斷出拳咕嚕  還有滾來滾去
but with punching and grunting and rolling around.

175
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,530
上了八堂課他就退出了
He quit after eight lessons

176
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,460
因為他不想騎自行車去六條街外的教室
because he didn't want to bike the six blocks to get there.

177
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,990
這算是哪門子的查克·諾里斯[世界空手道冠軍]
It hardly makes him Chuck Norris.

178
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,960
-是嗎  巴瑞  過來  -什么事
- Oh, really? Barry, get in here. - What?

179
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,340
你父親想在表演之前
Your father would like a sneak peek

180
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,960
先睹為快
of your routine before the big show.

181
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,210
亞當  去拿爆竹
Adam, get the firecrackers.

182
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,840
-不準用爆竹  -不用爆竹
- No firecrackers! - No firecrackers.

183
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,490
龍形身法  咿呀
Dragon stance! Kee-ya!

184
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,180
虎爪  咿呀
Tiger claw! Kee-ya!

185
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,360
相撲戰斧砍
Sumo tomahawk chop!

186
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,860
咿呀
Kee-ya!

187
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,010
助手  呈上兵器
Assistant. Present weaponry.

188
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,230
雙節棍
Nunchucks!

189
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,150
雙節棍
Nunchucks.

190
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,150
沒事  我沒事
That's okay. I'm okay.

191
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,370
金箍棒
Bo staff!

192
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,370
抱歉
Sorry.

193
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,550
現在
And now...

194
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,880
最致命的武器  我的雙拳
The most deadly weapon of 'em all--my hands.

195
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,510
不好  打劫
Oh, no! A robber!

196
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,010
別擔心  凱莉·勒布洛克  我來救你
Don't worry, Kelly Lebrock, I'll save you!

197
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,010
{\an8}[著名女影星]

198
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,700
不  不是這樣
No--oh-- don't!

199
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,900
你不應該打我
You're not supposed to hit me.

200
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,520
放下武器  亞當
Disarm! Adam!

201
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,860
老天  你應該放下武器
Jeez, you're supposed to disarm.

202
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,390
你應該放手
You're supposed to let go!

203
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,220
他已經被解除武器了
He has been disarmed!

204
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,110
現在  壓軸戲
And now... The big finish.

205
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,960
該死
Damn!

206
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,120
在表演時會碎的
That'll break during the show.

207
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,710
我這輩子從來沒見過
That was the greatest thing

208
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,220
這么精彩的表演
my eyeballs have ever, ever seen!

209
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,720
-要我再來一次嗎  -太好了
- Do you want me to go again? - Yes!

210
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,880
我們再來一遍
We're going again!

211
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,000
原來  不是所有父母都戴著"母親護目鏡"的
Turns out, not everyone had mom goggles.

212
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,620
再來一遍  再來一遍
Do it again! Do it again!

213
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,650
愛麗卡完全不關心
The talent show was the furthest thing

214
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,020
才藝表演  但老爺子希望改變這點
from Erica's mind, but Pops was hoping to change that.

215
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,930
孩子  不介意我坐一會兒吧
Hey, kiddo, mind if I sit down?

216
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,190
我知道你要說什么
I know what you're gonna say,

217
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,910
我不會參加才藝表演的
and I'm not doing the talent show.

218
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,880
我不是為這個來的
That's not why I'm here.

219
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,900
我是來  借雜志的
I came to... Borrow this magazine.

220
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,250
追猛男的八招
"Eight ways to catch a hunk."

221
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,130
這是什么垃圾
What is this garbage?

222
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,870
既然你自己說了
But since you brought it up--

223
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,210
老爺子  算了吧
Pops, forget it!

224
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,830
參加才藝表演  無異于社交自殺
Doing the talent show is social suicide.

225
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,070
我還不如走上舞臺
I might as well go up on stage

226
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,130
拿著塊寫著"我有虱子"的牌子
with a sign that says, "I have lice."

227
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,530
這種表演可不行
That doesn't sound like much of an act.

228
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,380
你有一副好嗓子
Come on, you have an amazing voice,

229
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,360
你彈得一手好吉他
a-and you're terrific on the guitar.

230
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,960
你得彈奏吉他
You got to play the guitar.

231
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,320
沒辦法  賣了
Can't. Sold it.

232
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,880
什么  你很喜歡那把吉他
What?! You loved that guitar.

233
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,950
現在我很喜歡我的皮外套
And now I love my leather jacket.

234
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,040
這話讓人惱火
That is very angering.

235
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,150
我很感謝你這么相信我
Look, I appreciate you believing in me

236
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,240
什么什么的  但讓我參加才藝表演
and all that crap, but there's no chance

237
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,250
絕對沒機會
I'm gonna do the talent show.

238
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,790
有機會的
Oh, there's a chance,

239
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,950
因為我會讓你參加的
'Cause I'm gonna get you to do it.

240
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,450
不可能的
Uh, not gonna happen!

241
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,710
走著瞧
We'll see!

242
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,450
浪費時間
Waste of time!

243
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,960
聽不到啦
Can't hear you!

244
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,500
早上好  小巴  這身空手道睡衣真不錯
Good morning, Bar. Nice karate pajamas.

245
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,030
這個叫空手道服
It's called a gi.

246
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,450
你得受點教育了  多看些電影吧
You need to educate yourself, man. See more movies.

247
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,640
我知道你媽媽喜歡這套香港的咿咿呀呀
Listen, I know your mom loves this whole Hong Kong fooey act,

248
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,010
但是  你有沒有考慮過做點別的
but... Haven't you considered doing something else?

249
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,730
-我為什么要這樣  -因為你是巴瑞·金伯格
- Why would I ever do that? - Because you're Barry Goldberg,

250
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,610
有許多不同才藝的人
a man of many different talents.

251
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,480
這倒是真的  我擅長的事多了
It's true. I am great at a lot of stuff.

252
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,790
滑板  饒舌  霹靂舞
Skateboarding, rapping, breakdancing.

253
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,670
再來點
A little...

254
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,600
街舞
Pop-and-lock action.

255
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,280
我們為什么要說這個
Why are we even having this conversation?

256
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,710
我要表演空手道
I'm going kara-te.

257
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,450
委員會的裁決對我有利
The committee ruled in my favor.

258
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,780
巴瑞  你不能表演這個  我是過來人
Barry, you can't do this act. I speak from experience.

259
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,330
你說什么呢
What are you talking about?

260
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,690
我在你這么大的時候
When I was your age,

261
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,810
我是橄欖球隊中最搞笑的人
I was the funniest guy on the football team.

262
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,360
搞笑  你什么時候搞笑過
Funny? Since when are you funny?

263
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,240
我相當搞笑
I'm plenty funny, okay?

264
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,750
我是個開心果
I was hilarious.

265
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,720
我喜歡講黃段子
I used to tell dirty jokes,

266
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,830
我用毛巾拍隊友屁屁
I'd snap guys with a towel.

267
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,350
我給所有人取綽號
I gave everybody a nickname,

268
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,820
比如說  小白臉和小個子
like, uh, pretty boy and shorty.

269
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,380
這些綽號太糟糕了
Those are terrible nicknames.

270
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,130
小個子長得并不矮
Shorty wasn't short.

271
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,770
事實上  他非常高
As a matter of fact, he was a giant.

272
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,030
我的天  腺體出了問題
Oh, my god. Had a gland problem.

273
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,370
挺讓人傷心的
Actually sad stuff.

274
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,560
-你想說什么  -我想說
- What's the point to this? - The point is,

275
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,900
教練說  默里  你是個人物
the coach said, "Murray, you're a card.

276
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,600
去主持賽前動員大會吧
Why don't you host the pep rally?"

277
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,810
我去了
So I did.

278
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,580
我上臺后  意識到
I get up there, I realize

279
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,850
我只能講上一分鐘
I've only got one minute of material.

280
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,270
一分鐘
One minute!

281
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,960
我在全校面前傻眼了
I bombed in front of the whole school.

282
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,420
-他們沖我扔桃子  -他們為什么有桃子
- They threw peaches at me. - Why'd they have peaches?

283
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,710
不知道  當時根本不是桃子上市的季節
I don't know! They weren't even in season!

284
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,460
我只知道  我不想你經歷
All I know is, I don't want you to go through

285
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,230
我經歷的這一切
what I went through.

286
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,640
請別表演  我求你了
Please don't do your act. I'm begging you!

287
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,340
這么說你覺得我的表演會砸
So you think I'm gonna suck?

288
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,640
不是  兒子
No, son.

289
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,560
我知道你會砸
I know you're going to suck.

290
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,060
我有話告訴你
Well, I got news for you.

291
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,940
觀眾不會扔桃子
The audience won't throw peaches.

292
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,320
他們會扔鮮花
They'll throw flowers.

293
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,570
喝彩  咪咪
And cheers! And boobs!

294
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,570
赤裸裸的咪咪  到處都是
Naked boobs! Everywhere!

295
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,070
你走著瞧  走著瞧
Just you watch. Watch!

296
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,430
咪咪  赤裸裸的咪咪
Boobs! Naked!

297
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,460
在那一刻  我爸意識到
In that moment, my dad realized

298
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,580
他只有一個辦法來保護巴瑞
he only had one way to protect Barry.

299
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,350
他要通過阻止他
He was gonna stand up for his son

300
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,880
來支持他
by standing in his way.

301
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,080
格拉斯科特老師嗎
Mr. Glascott?

302
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,910
我們需要談談
We need to talk.

303
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,500
-我又被刷下來了  -什么
- I'm out again! - What?!

304
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,220
格拉斯科特老師說  國家才藝表演委員會
Mr. Glascott said the natial talent show committee

305
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,630
推翻了三州才藝表演委員會的裁決
overruled the tri-state talent show committee.

306
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,900
這真是令人驚訝
Well, this is very surprising

307
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,310
無法接受  但他們已經裁決了
and unacceptable, but they have made their ruling,

308
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,710
我相信我們應該尊重他們的決定
and I believe we should honor it.

309
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,520
這個國家的才藝表演委員會制度已經沒救了
The talent show committee system in this country's broken!

310
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,020
國家委員會
National committee, huh?

311
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,530
它的權力比三州委員會大
Well, it's more powerful than the tri-state committee.

312
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,710
-我能怎么說  -難以置信
- What can I say? - This is unbelievable.

313
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,170
你對我的行為指手畫腳一番后
You trotted down to that school

314
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,150
自己又殺到了學校嗎
after being so judgy with me about it?

315
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,260
我只是做個關心孩子成長的家長
Hey, I'm just being an involved parent.

316
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,040
你告訴我  這是好事
You told me that was a good thing.

317
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,200
你做就是壞事  你讓自己的兒子
Not when you do it. You got your own son

318
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,300
被踢出了才藝表演  誰會這樣做啊
kicked out of a talent show. Who does that?

319
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,130
我這是為了孩子好
Look, I'm doing the kid a favor

320
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,210
我沒有一直戴著"母親護目鏡"
by not wearing mom goggles all the time.

321
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,820
-母親什么  -護目鏡
- Mom what? - Goggles!

322
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,230
我們都知道你一直戴著
We all know you wear 'em!

323
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,550
這讓你覺得咱家的孩子好聰明
It makes you think our kids are so brilliant

324
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,770
好完美  拉的屎都是彩虹色的
and perfect and poop rainbows.

325
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,900
哪怕一次  拜托你取下"母親護目鏡"
For once, just take those mom goggles off

326
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,780
承認咱們的能干孩子們
and admit that our wonderful children

327
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,320
在許多事上都是不行的
are terrible at so many different things.

328
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,660
我不會
I will not.

329
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,060
他們這輩子
They're gonna have plenty of people

330
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,460
會有許多人想要打擊他們
trying to tear them down in life,

331
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,230
只要他們還在我的屋檐下
so while they're under my roof,

332
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,720
我至少能做的就是幫他們建立自信
the least I can do is try to build them up.

333
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,920
接受咱們孩子是庸才的事實吧
Accept our children's mediocrity!

334
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,330
這是種解脫
It's freeing!

335
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,570
你不是吧  當我不存在嗎
Seriously? I'm right here!

336
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,340
不是說你  你棒極了
Oh, not--not you. You're fantastic.

337
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,480
是啊  你自己也是個活寶
Yeah, you're a real gem yourself.

338
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,540
隨著才藝表演的臨近
As the talent show drew near,

339
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,590
老爺子覺得是時候拿出秘密武器了
Pops thought it was time to pull out his secret weapon.

340
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,850
你好  我
Hello. I...

341
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,220
我不知道你在這里
I didn't realize you were here.

342
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,860
我只是坐在這里
Me, I'm just sitting here,

343
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,450
休息下  彈奏下班卓琴
relaxing, strumming the old banjo.

344
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,330
你彈了也白彈
You're wasting your strums.

345
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,500
是嗎  還是說是時候溫習下
Am I? Or is it time to do that duet

346
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,020
以前的二重唱
we used to do?

347
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,380
你不回家嗎  比爾·貝莉
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey?

348
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,700
老爺子  老爺子
Pops. Pops!

349
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,200
我不會參加才藝表演的
I'm not doing the talent show.

350
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,370
求你了  參加吧
Come on! Do this show!

351
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,200
我甚至可以把班卓琴借給你
You can even borrow my banjo.

352
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,710
別誤會
Don't take this the wrong way,

353
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,710
但在舞臺上拿著把班卓琴
but toting a banjo up on stage

354
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,820
可不能算作酷
isn't exactly what you'd call cool.

355
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,490
什么時候開始班卓琴都不算酷了
Since when is the banjo not cool?

356
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,710
從班卓琴被發明開始
Since the invention of the banjo.

357
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,540
愛麗卡  你小的時候  什么都參加
Erica, when you were younger, you used to do everything--

358
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,360
排球  體操  校合唱團
Volleyball, gymnastics, school chorus.

359
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,720
你這是怎么啦
What happened to you?

360
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,720
我上高中了  這里會有人對你指手畫腳
Well, I go to high school, where people judge you.

361
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,520
如果你覺得班卓琴不算酷
Well, if you don't think the banjo's cool,

362
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,020
我還可以拿手風琴
I can always break out the accordion.

363
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,160
結果  老爺子不是唯一一個
Turns out Pops wasn't the only one

364
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,030
想讓金伯格家的孩子上才藝表演的
still trying to get a Goldberg into the talent show.

365
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,300
或是被踢出才藝表演
Or out of the talent show.

366
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,680
別擋道  白癡
Get out of the way, idiot!

367
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,690
你來這里做什么
What are you doing here?

368
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,540
阻止你做你要做的事
Stopping you from doing what you're doing!

369
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,040
我來這里唯一要做的是
The only thing I'm here to do is...

370
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,840
向左虛晃  向右
Fake left, go right.

371
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,560
鼓勵有才藝的學生
But isn't it your responsibility

372
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,170
-不是你的責任嗎  -爸
- to encourage talented students-- - Dad?!

373
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,330
我只是跟格拉斯科特老師說
Oh, hey. I-I was just talking to Mr. Glascott here

374
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,780
讓愛麗卡參加才藝表演
about putting Erica into the talent show.

375
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,180
我受不了了
I can't take this anymore.

376
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,980
你們想要孩子參加  他們能參加
You want your kids in, they're in.

377
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,100
太棒了  哪一個孩子
Oh, great! Which one?

378
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,600
我不知道  兩個都參加  都不參加
I don't know. Both of them? None of them?

379
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,100
我真的不在乎
I really don't care! I mean,

380
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,280
這只是一個愚蠢的高中才藝表演
it's a stupid freakin' high school talent show!

381
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,700
我一時心軟
I had one moment of weakness

382
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,710
想幫你們的兒子一把
where I tried to do something kind for your son.

383
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,070
我道歉
I apologize!

384
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,290
現在我只關心
All I care about now

385
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,700
我還欠著兩萬的學生貸款
is that I owe 20 grand in student loans,

386
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,210
我住的是一個小單間
I live in a studio apartment

387
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,550
下面是一個熱烘烘的干洗店
above a steaming hot dry cleaner,

388
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,020
我的副業是送披薩
and I have a second job where I work as a pizza man,

389
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,990
偶爾我還送披薩
and occasionally I get to deliver pizzas

390
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,100
到學生家里
to my students.

391
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,460
而且我還有一只甩不掉的鸚鵡
Oh, also I have a parrot that I can't get rid of.

392
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,720
鸚鵡能活80年  你們知道嗎
They live for 80 years. Did you know that?

393
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,010
沒人告訴你這個
Nobody tells you about that.

394
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,800
你得把它們寫進遺囑
You have to put them in your will!

395
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,300
真是噩夢
It's a nightmare!

396
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,130
你們想怎樣都行
So, yeah, do whatever you want to do,

397
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,960
因為我真的不在乎
'Cause I really don't care!

398
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,810
我想吃披薩了
That made me hungry for pizza.

399
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,110
誰要吃披薩
Who wants pizza?

400
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,330
叫你們來
All right, we've gathered you here

401
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,540
是因為我們有好消息
because we've got some great news.

402
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,440
才藝表演有變化
There's been some movement on the talent show.

403
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,950
又來  嫌我們大悲大喜還不夠嗎
Again? This has been an emotional roller coaster.

404
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,190
原來  巴瑞可以參加表演
Turns out Barry can do the show!

405
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,650
你不想的話  可以不去
Or not, if you don't want to.

406
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,950
說什么呢
What are you talking about?

407
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,960
國家才藝表演委員會已經裁決了
The national talent show committee already ruled.

408
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:24,960
這是有法律約束力的
It's binding.

409
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,340
事實上
Actually, um...

410
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,360
-我們就是委員會  -什么
- We're the committees. - What?

411
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,960
你母親自作主張
Your mother took it upon herself

412
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,170
在你沒被選上參加才藝表演時
to trot on down to the high school

413
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,840
殺到學校
and yell at Mr. Glascott

414
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,970
-吼了格拉斯科特老師一頓  -什么
- when you didn't get into the talent show. - What?!

415
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,170
你父親也殺去了
Your father trotted, too.

416
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,970
至少我是想讓他參加表演
At least I was trying to get him into the show.

417
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,780
難以置信  為什么大家都要殺到哪里去
Unbelievable! Why is anyone trotting anywhere?!

418
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,600
一線光明就是  愛麗卡也可以參加表演
The silver lining? Erica's in the show, too.

419
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,540
你說什么
Excuse me?

420
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,320
我跟格拉斯科特老師談過了  他問題多多
I talked to Mr. Glascott. Troubled man.

421
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,100
但我跟他說了你的事
But I told him all about you.

422
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,630
你跟他說點別的吧
Well, you can tell him something else.

423
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,460
我不會參加表演的
I'm not doing that show.

424
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,990
我也不會
Me, too!

425
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,870
因為媽媽插手了  我不會再參加表演了
'Cause mom meddled, I'm not doing that show anymore!

426
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,870
因為爸爸不相信我
And 'cause dad doesn't believe in me,

427
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,980
我要證明你錯了  我會參加表演
I'm gonna prove you wrong, and I'm gonna do the show.

428
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,380
等等  你到底參不參加
Wait. Wh-which one is it?

429
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,470
我不知道
I don't know!

430
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,410
我太生你們兩個的氣了
I'm just so angry at both of you.

431
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,140
我真的覺得你應該參加
I really think you should do it.

432
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,410
好吧  我和亞當談過了
All right. I spoke with Adam.

433
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,790
這事對許多人來說太重要了
This thing matters a lot to a lot of people.

434
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,050
我會參加
I'm back in.

435
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,560
才藝表演又提上了日程
The talent show was back on,

436
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,990
我的導演作品初登場也一樣
and so was my directorial debut!

437
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,410
威廉·佩恩高中的
It was only the opening act

438
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,770
假日才藝表演才開始第一個節目
of the William Penn Academy holiday talent show,

439
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,330
巴瑞就已經怯場了
and Barry was already getting cold feet.

440
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,670
他們好厲害
They're really good.

441
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,070
想要媲美太難了
It's gonna be a tough act to follow.

442
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,010
你擔心什么  你有黑帶
What are you worried about? You got a black belt.

443
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,840
這是從老爸的浴袍上拿下來的
That I took from dad's bathrobe!

444
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,260
呆子
Dorks!

445
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,410
那一刻  巴瑞明白了
In that moment, Barry realized

446
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,170
為什么拉克茜·布魯姆喜歡看才藝表演
the reason why Lexy Bloom loved the talent show.

447
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,330
和其他那些酷孩子一樣
Like the rest of the cool crowd,

448
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,590
她可以嘲笑舞臺上的所有白癡
she could bag on all the idiots on stage.

449
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,340
-我不能上舞臺  -什么
- I can't go out there! - What?!

450
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,850
我做不到  爸爸說得對
I can't do it! Dad was right.

451
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,550
我只會讓自己丟臉
I'm gonna humiliate myself.

452
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,060
他們會沖我扔桃子的
They're gonna throw peaches at me!

453
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,350
桃子  誰有桃子  你說什么呢
Peaches? Who has peaches? What are you talking about?

454
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,850
我做不到
I can't do it!

455
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,550
盡管老爺子做了最大的努力
Despite Pops' best efforts,

456
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,130
愛麗卡卻連才藝表演都沒去
Erica decided to not even go to the talent show.

457
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,400
但咱們的外公  還有一張王牌
But our grandfather had one more card to play.

458
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,490
別想著酷  做自己就好  老爺子贈

459
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,290
這是倒數第二個節目
And that was our second-to-last act,

460
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,670
埃倫·麥克雷表演雜耍
Ellen Mcrae juggling!

461
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,080
好了  空手道小子  下一個到你
All right, karate kid, you're up next.

462
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:33,980
我不能出去
I can't go out there.

463
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,750
說什么呢  你是壓軸節目
What are you talking about? You're our closer.

464
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,420
得有壓軸節目才行
We gotta have a closer.

465
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,780
或者我直接宣布結束也行
Or I could just end it.

466
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,890
我不參加了
Well, I'm out.

467
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,840
我參加
I'm in.

468
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,660
我外公說也許我能上場
My grandfather said you might have a spot open for me.

469
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,650
既然我完全不在乎  是的
Well, seeing as I don't care at all, yes.

470
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,390
金伯格家的
One of the Goldbergs.

471
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,390
那么
So, um...

472
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,880
這是我沖澡時喜歡唱的歌
This is a song I sing in the shower.

473
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,330
快點唱完了事吧
Just get it over with, I guess.

474
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,870
你是個無情的人  有著不羈的過去
Oh, you're a real tough cookie with the long history

475
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,640
碎掉顆顆芳心  我心也唏噓不已
Of breakin' little hearts like the one in me

476
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,430
一切都沒關系  看你這次如何出擊
That's okay, let's see how you do it

477
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,390
舉起你的雙拳  我們直入正題
Put up your dukes, let's get down to it

478
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,730
你放馬過來
Hit me with your best shot

479
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,010
你盡管放馬過來吧
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?

480
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,170
你放馬過來
Oh, hit me with your best shot

481
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,320
出絕招吧
Fire away

482
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,250
你上來一句"來吧"
You come on with your "come on"

483
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,010
并不光明正大
You don't fight fair

484
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,090
但是沒關系  我并不在乎
But that's okay, just see if I care

485
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,630
打倒我  一切都是徒勞
Knock me down, it's all in vain

486
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,470
我會重新振作起來
I'll get back up on my feet again

487
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,680
你放馬過來
Hit me with your best shot

488
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,120
你盡管放馬過來吧
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?

489
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,150
你放馬過來
Oh, hit me with your best shot

490
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,070
出絕招吧
Fire away

491
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,150
-我要參加  -還是不在乎
- I'm back in! - Still don't care.

492
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,900
你是個無情的人  有著不羈的過去
You're a real tough cookie with the long history

493
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,680
碎掉顆顆芳心
Of breakin' little hearts

494
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,820
我心也唏噓不已
Like the one in me

495
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,830
一切都沒關系  看你這次如何出擊
That's okay, let's see how you do it

496
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,690
舉起你的雙拳  我們直入正題
Put up your dukes, let's get down to it

497
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,990
你放馬過來
Hit me with your best shot

498
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,890
偷襲
Sneak attack!

499
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,630
你盡管放馬過來吧
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?

500
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,510
你放馬過來
Hit me with your best shot

501
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,480
出絕招吧
Fire away

502
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
我的寶貝
My babies!

503
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,260
你放馬過來
Hit me with your best shot

504
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,670
你盡管放馬過來吧
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?

505
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,740
你放馬過來
Hit me with your best shot

506
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,110
你可以的  寶貝
You can do it, baby!

507
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,570
老爺子是對的
Pops was right.

508
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,690
沒什么可以令愛麗卡不好意思的
Erica had nothing to be embarrassed about.

509
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,980
事實上在那一刻  作為金伯格一分子
In fact, in that moment, it felt damn good

510
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,300
感覺好極了
to be a Goldberg.

511
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,500
我家孩子是全世界最有才藝的
I have the most talented kids in the world!

512
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,700
比你們家的強多了  比你們家的強多了
More talented than yours! More talented than yours!

513
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,370
-冷靜  冷靜  -我的天
- Calm down. Calm down. - Oh, my god!

514
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,130
尤其對我爸來說  他這輩子第一次
Especially for my dad, who put on the mom goggles...

515
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,010
戴上"母親護目鏡"
for the first time in his life.

516
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,570
太棒了  太棒了
Yeah! Yeah...

517
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,550
謝謝大家
Thank you, guys.

518
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,550
至于我  我做了所有優秀導演會做的事
And as for me, I did what any good director would do--

519
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,310
讓我的明星閃閃發光
I made my star look good.

520
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,310
咿呀
Kee-ya.

521
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,160
我把巴瑞的木板換成了軟木
I switched Barry's board for balsa wood.

522
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,820
獻給教會我空手道的哥哥

523
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,160
媽媽  下一次才藝表演只剩一年時間了
Okay, mom. Next talent show's only a year away.

524
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,720
越早開始準備越好  給我露兩手
Can't start preparing too early! Show me what you got.

525
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,710
我寫了首慢板抒情靈樂
I wrote a smooth soul jam.

526
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,470
準備好了嗎
You ready?

527
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,580
女孩
Girl

528
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,590
我要和你在一起
I want to get with you

529
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,500
大甜甜要和你在一起
Big tasty wants to get with you

530
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,470
你得  嗯  退后
You got to, mmm, back it up

531
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,680
嗯  再退后
Mmm, back it up

532
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,020
不好意思  這是巴瑞·金伯格
I'm sorry, was that Barry Goldberg,

533
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,840
還是巴瑞·曼尼洛  我沒覺得有區別
or Barry Manilow? 'cause I can't tell the difference!

534
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,840
{\an8}[浪漫歌王]

535
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,920
見鬼
Crap!
