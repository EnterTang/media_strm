11
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,490
Moves the ball.

12
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,830
Swoops!

13
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,370
My brother Barry -- a world-class athlete...

14
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,650
Doesn't count. I wasn't ready.

15
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,910
...In his own mind.

16
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,210
He dedicated his life to hockey, hoops,

17
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,920
and the art of dance, or whatever this is.

18
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,760
Even though Barry dreamed of greatness,

19
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,030
one thing always stood in his way.

20
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,300
No more karate! End of story!

21
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,120
And that thing was my mom.

22
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,050
No karate?! Are you nuts?!

23
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,260
I'm the next Chuck Norris!

24
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,980
She always had a tragic tale

25
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,850
to warn us about the dangers of everything.

26
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,670
That's what Esther Carp's son said,

27
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,870
and he got a big toe right in his eye.

28
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,250
Now he can't see color. Is that what you want?

29
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,810
Ruth Rosner's grandson was doing the worm.

30
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,530
He cracked every vertebrae in his body.

31
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,980
Now he's two inches shorter. Is that what you want?

32
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,100
How much will you be moving

33
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,090
when a skate glides over your windpipe?

34
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,710
It happened to Judy Muntz's nephew,

35
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,060
and now he can only communicate

36
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,240
with a speak & spell he wears around his neck.

37
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,220
Is that what you want?

38
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,810
Who are these people?

39
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,040
Tragedy befalls all of them, and I have no idea who they are!

40
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,740
My mom's constant smothering

41
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,340
led Barry to take out his aggression elsewhere.

42
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,870
Um, it's been like five minutes.

43
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,240
I can live without the zagnut.

44
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,500
Not on my watch.

45
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,470
You wanted nuts all zagged up in hot fudge,

46
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,110
cookie dough, honey, and peppermint dust?

47
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,610
None of those things are in that bar.

48
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,830
Barry's gonna get it for you.

49
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,540
- Who's Barry? - I'm Barry!

50
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,000
How do you not know this by now?!

51
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,110
Wait! Come back! I can do it!

52
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,020
Come on, C4! Let go, you son of a bitch!

53
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,300
- Nice moves, Goldfarb. - What?

54
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,510
I've been watching you, kid.

55
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,850
- I seen you freak out and melt down all over school. - Go on.

56
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,920
You got that unhinged look in your eye.

57
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,860
I like it. I like it a lot.

58
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,920
My mother says my eyes are the brownest brown.

59
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,320
I've seen browner.

60
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,450
But let me ask you something --

61
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,440
Have you ever thought about joining

62
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,620
the varsity wrestling team?

63
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,620
Have I?! No.

64
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,910
Well, we got an opening in your weight class...

65
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,840
If you're man enough to handle the pain.

66
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,270
In that moment,

67
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,170
Barry realized how to win over Lexy Bloom --

68
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,300
A varsity jacket --

69
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,820
The holy grail with cheap leather sleeves.

70
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,790
I'm in!

71
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,220
Bring the pain.

72
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,510
Look out, Hulk Hogan.

73
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,220
Barry Goldberg's on the loose.

74
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,580
Ohh, I heard something pop!

75
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,870
It was impossible to be a kid in the '80s

76
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,590
and not love "Star wars."

77
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,510
It was the movie that changed everything.

78
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,590
It gave us lightsabers, the force,

79
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,520
and Billy Dee Williams in a cape.

81
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,280
So you could imagine how pumped I was

82
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,840
when George Lucas decided to close out the trilogy forever.

83
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,510
Boom! It is upon us!

84
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,130
"Return of the Jedi"! That's right, they did it again.

85
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,740
And guess what -- it opens Friday at the Hiway theater.

86
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,330
Oh, my god! That's amazing!

87
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,090
Go away.

88
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,280
You clearly don't understand what I'm saying.

89
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,920
More "Star Wars."

90
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,490
We get it. "Star Wars" is your life.

91
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,390
But if you still want to have a life,

92
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,840
then stop pestering me.

93
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,190
I'm sensing more resistance than I was expecting,

94
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,330
so I'll adjust my expectations.

95
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,670
Instead, I'll ask that you pack a sleeping bag,

96
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,370
some rations, and spend the night with me

97
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,150
on the sidewalk waiting for tickets.

98
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,530
What were your origina expectations?

99
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,680
Don't answer that because I don't care,

100
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,880
'cause it's not happening.

101
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,490
Please!

102
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,770
Mom says the only way I can do it is if you come with me.

103
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,000
Mom only said that because she knew I'd say no.

104
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,730
Obviously, but she doesn't know what I know --

105
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,020
You love "Star Wars."

106
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,910
Bow before princess Leia!

107
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,850
Never!

108
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,880
Death grip!

109
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,520
Reverse death grip!

110
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,420
I'm dead.

111
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,660
- I made copies. - Damn it!

112
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,030
Here's how this is gonna go --

113
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,920
You're either gonna come to the movie with me,

114
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,750
or this tape magically ends up playing

115
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,110
at your next school assembly.

116
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,950
I hate you.

117
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,440
We're gonna have so much fun.

118
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,350
Ask mom.

119
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,350
I got a permission slip for --

120
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,940
- Ask mom. - Mom will say no.

121
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,240
- Ask mom. - I need you to sign it.

122
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,300
Ask mom.

123
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,560
I'm joining the wrestling team.

124
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,550
What? Really?

125
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,660
So you'll let me wrestle?

126
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,840
Of course.

127
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,020
You know, your old man was quite the grappler

128
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,370
back in high school.

129
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,820
- I bet that's the reason you're doing it. - Not at all.

130
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,730
- Tiny bit? - No.

131
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,830
- Maybe a little? - No.

132
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,800
Not even this much?

133
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,190
I'm doing it for the ladies.

134
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,030
You see, first you join the wrestling team,

135
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,930
then you get the varsity jacket, then you get the power,

136
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,870
then you get the women.

137
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,060
Everything you just said makes so much sense.

138
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,670
Let me teach you some moves.

139
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,520
No need. Already learned them.

140
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,900
- How? - A little thing called "Wrestlemania."

141
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,870
This is Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka doing the superfly splash!

142
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,440
Piledriver!

143
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,550
Atomic elbow drop!

144
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,730
George "The animal" Steele is biting the turnbuckle.

145
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,660
Stop! Who does that?!

146
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,130
The claw! The claw!

147
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,010
He's applying the sleeper hold!

148
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,530
Body slam!

149
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,490
You do understand it's not that kind of wrestling.

150
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,160
- What? - That stuff's not real.

151
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,920
- What are you saying? - None of it's real.

152
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,930
If you're telling me the Iron Sheik isn't fighting

154
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,410
to protect his oil interests in this country,

155
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,610
Then my world will literally cave in.

156
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,300
Yeah, my dad knew this was gonna take some time to explain.

157
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,530
Meanwhile, I was ready to have the time of my life.

158
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,840
Back then, you couldn't just order your seats online.

159
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,890
You had to wait for days on end.

160
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,430
Us "Star wars" fans were the first ones to camp out.

161
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,210
We were the trailblazers -- the coolest of the cool,

162
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,420
And everyone knew it...

163
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,130
Well, except my sister.

164
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,490
I want to walk down this line

165
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,230
and punch everyone in the face.

166
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,480
Stop. We're gonna have fun.

167
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,230
And who knows? We might make some lifelong friends.

168
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,180
Hello!

169
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,650
Master yoda I am.

170
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,530
Sit next to you in line we will.

171
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,960
Much bonding we will do.

172
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,910
How old are you?

173
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,900
46 on the 8th I'll be.

174
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,100
Oh, my god. You have a wedding ring on?

175
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,900
Come on, Erica.

176
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,480
I know you're some big high-school hotshot now,

177
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,380
but admit it -- these are still your people.

178
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,710
Okay, the old dude with the puppet is not my people.

179
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,830
And the guy riding the dog -- not my people.

180
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,730
That dog is a tauntaun, and you know it!

181
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,730
Can't you just try a little bit...For me?

182
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,070
Fine. A little.

183
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,090
What's up, mama?

184
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,910
You ever tandem on a tauntaun?

185
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,090
Not as dirty as it sounds.

186
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,130
Go away!

187
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,280
She's as chilly as the the wampa's lair.

188
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,670
Right? Right? Am I right?

189
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,570
As Erica was finally loosening up,

190
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,740
my dad was helping Barry lock down that varsity jacket.

191
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,900
You seriously want me to lie to mom?

192
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,670
Yes!

193
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,930
You really think your mother would willingly

194
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,650
let you fight another man with your bare hands?

195
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,690
But I can't lie. I'm a terrible liar.

196
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,770
Everyone knows that.

197
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,270
You just got to keep it quick and simple.

198
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,410
Here, let me think.

199
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,340
What would you be doing after school?

200
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,080
Wait! I got the perfect cover.

201
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,620
We'll tell mom I joined the army.

202
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,680
That's what you're going to tell your mother --

203
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,250
You're going into combat?!

204
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,180
Not combat!

205
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,720
I could be one of those dudes who flies a helicopter

206
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,340
and drops in bags of rice.

207
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,950
So now you're flying a helicopter.

208
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,230
- Think I can't? - No!

209
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,690
I'm tired of you not believing in me!

210
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,230
I'm a good driver!

211
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,780
Flying is just like driving, but in 3-d.

212
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,030
I don't even know what that means.

213
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,760
Okay, I-I think we got a little off the rails here.

214
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,090
L-let's just move on.

215
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,750
No! I'm not moving on until he says he believes in me.

216
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,520
Fine.

217
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,090
I believe you can drop rice from an imaginary helicopter.

218
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,910
Here's an idea. How about the school play?

219
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,650
Tell her you got a bit part like, uh, a palm tree

220
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,640
or, uh, a villager who goes like this in the background.

221
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,000
I can do that.

222
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,050
You know what, Al?

223
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,760
Th could actually work.

224
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,010
Hi, handsome men.

225
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,450
How's it going?

226
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,870
I joined the wrestling team.

227
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,010
What?! Yeah, no. Never.

228
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,240
Evelyn Sanderson's son joined a wrestling team.

229
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,740
He put one foot --

230
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,170
No. No need to tell us that very tragic tale.

231
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,300
Save it for another time. Barry was just kidding.

232
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,450
Tell her what you're really doing.

233
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,920
I'm in a play?

234
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,440
Are you kidding me?

235
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,240
Snuggle monster, I'm so happy!

236
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,740
What part in "Annie" did you get?

237
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,530
- What's "Annie"? - The musical.

238
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,380
There's fliers all around school.

239
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,460
Who are you playing?

240
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,580
I'm this guy!

241
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,820
What is that? What are you doing?

242
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,140
What guy is that?

243
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,060
I'm the guy.

244
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,480
You're daddy warbucks?

245
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:23,750
Sure.

246
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,670
You're daddy warbucks?!

247
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,400
Well, I think he's still a moron

248
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,180
and it's a stupid idea

249
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,430
And I am not going to get behind it!

250
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,910
He's doing the play, and that's the end of it.

251
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,670
You convinced me. I now stand behind my son.

252
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,320
This is so exciting!

253
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,720
Ohh, I've always wanted to be a stage mom!

254
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,880
I'm gonna build sets and rig lights and sew costumes,

255
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,210
and I'll even be an understudy if need be.

256
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,740
No.

257
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,930
If you dare peek into one rehearsal,

258
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,350
I will quit the play.

259
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,720
- You wouldn't. - I would.

260
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,530
What is wrong with my children?

261
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,660
Why won't they let me

262
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,050
completely immerse myself in their lives?

263
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,930
It's okay, it's okay. I'm okay.

264
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,020
Well, I might not be able to attend an official rehearsal,

265
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,570
but that doesn't mean your mom can't show you a few moves.

266
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,380
I'm gonna go throw on my leg warmers and leotard.

267
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,590
What just happened?

268
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,260
What just happened is you have to learn "Annie."

269
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,860
Good job, moron.

270
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,970
We were only three hours into our "Star wars" camp-out,

271
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,480
but the long wait didn't matter.

272
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,700
I finally had my sister back.

273
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,000
So, I have a theory.

274
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,970
"Star wars" takes place a long time ago

275
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,900
in a galaxy far, far away, right?

276
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,750
Of course.

277
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,930
So, what if Han Solo is frozen in carbonite

278
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,550
for like a million years

279
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,620
and shipped to a planet far, far away

280
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,980
and that planet was earth in 1940

281
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,570
and he's thawed out just in time

282
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,170
to change his name to Indiana Jones?

283
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,050
I have so much more to say on this topic,

284
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,440
but I drank all the soda.

285
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,040
Dude, that's our rations!

286
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,160
Save my spot.

287
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,500
Yep, Erica was letting her geek flag fly

288
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,130
and didn't care who saw it, until her friends arrived.

289
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,970
Erica?

290
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,240
Lainey, hey! Hi, hello.

291
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,280
What are you doing here?

292
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,390
We're going to get cheesesteaks.

293
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,850
What are you... doing here?

294
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,970
What's up, legs?

295
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,380
That's... what I'm doing here, too.

296
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,860
Isn't this the cheesesteak line?

297
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,140
Eddie's been asking about you. Come with us.

298
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,540
Yeah. Okay.

299
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,630
You go ahead, and I'll catch up with you in a second.

300
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,390
Okay.

301
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,410
Um, my brother will be back in one minute.

302
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,880
Will you hold this spot for me?

303
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,930
Is that a yes?

304
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,550
What is that?

305
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,130
Just save our damn place!

306
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,270
All right. If you come to your feet, go for the takedown.

307
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,280
Don't let him get away with that! More explosion there!

308
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,130
- Whoa, what are you doing? What are you doing? - What?

309
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,470
What are you doing with the folding chair?

310
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,090
You said to practice our takedowns.

311
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,990
The chair-bash is my character's patented move.

312
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,000
Your character?

313
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,330
Yeah. For the WWF.

314
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,030
They call me Goldberg.

315
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,970
My backstory is my parents gave me up for adoption,

316
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,010
and then I grew up on the rough streets of Philly.

317
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,630
I'm sensitive, so ladies love me,

318
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,910
But I also have a raging side, so men can relate, too.

319
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,940
But this isn't the WWF.

320
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,500
And as someone whose parents really did

321
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,310
give him up for adoption, I can promise you

322
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,840
it's a lot more emotionally complicated than that.

323
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,480
Now, put the chair back.

324
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,890
While Barry was having a tough time

325
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,110
accepting this wasn't the WWF,

326
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,980
he was having an even tougher time learning "Annie."

327
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,320
Together at last

328
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,520
Together forever

329
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,520
We're tying a knot

330
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,830
What's that, Murray?

331
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,820
They never can sever

332
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,090
I don't need sunshine now

333
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,540
To turn my gray skies blue

334
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,300
Sing it from the diaphragm.

335
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,980
I don't need anything but you

336
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,130
I'm kind wondering if this whole thing is worth it.

337
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,220
It is what it is.

338
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,830
Pops and my dad had helped Barry

339
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,520
pull off the perfect cover story.

340
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,490
Unfortunately, Erica wasn't interested in covering for me.

341
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,700
Hey, that's my spot. My sister was saving it for me.

342
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,470
Where did she go?

343
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,140
Like I care what your sister would do.

344
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,920
She went to get a cheesesteak with her smoking-hot friend.

345
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,560
Come on.

346
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,860
I just went to the bathroom for like 10 seconds.

347
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,200
Sorry, man. But you should have planned ahead.

348
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,090
The smart ones of us brought along someone

349
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,270
we could trust to hold our spot in line.

350
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,120
Others in more unwieldy costumes

351
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,000
have rigged themselves with elaborate tubing

352
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,450
and disposable plastic bags

353
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,320
so that they might quietly relieve themselves

354
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,030
even while talking to a stranger.

355
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,370
What?

356
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,380
Can't a man "Ahh" in relief without being judged?

357
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,490
Unreal. Unreal, you guys.

358
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,210
Seriously?

359
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,970
You're not gonna let me back into my spot?

360
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,120
I'm just a boy.

361
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:34,960
Seriously?

362
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,250
Luke Skywalker was just a boy, okay?

363
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,580
Rules are the rules.

364
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,850
Good luck catching the Sunday matinee.

365
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,150
My sister had done the unthinkable.

366
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,400
She ruined "Star wars."

367
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,240
You're on the mat sizing up your opponent.

368
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,770
The ref blows the whistle.

369
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,130
He makes his move. What do you do?

370
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,740
I bounce off the ropes to get momentum,

371
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,110
and I spear him with my body.

372
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,400
Again! It's not that kind of wres--

373
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,130
I know, it's not that type of wrestling.

374
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,080
I get it.

375
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,920
But those are the only moves I perfected

376
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,330
on my bed jumping around.

377
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,110
It's true. I've seen him. He's quite a jumper, this one.

378
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,340
Okay, let me show you a real move.

379
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,660
This was my specialty back in the day.

380
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,630
You use your opponent's weight and strength against him.

381
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,720
You smell like sandwich.

382
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,780
Shut up.

383
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,440
As I lean in to you, you pull back

384
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,800
and use your opponent's momentum to take him down!

385
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,910
Oh, my god. I'm so bored right now.

386
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,770
Just let me hit you with something!

387
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,730
Pops, get me a 2x4.

388
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,530
What are you doing?! No 2x4s! I told you!

389
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,330
Barry Norman Goldberg, look at me.

390
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,690
Are you on the wrestling team?

391
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,470
No?

392
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,440
Oh, really?

393
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,360
Because I was just down at the school theater

394
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,640
building an orphanage for a show

395
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,210
that apparently you're not even in.

396
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,600
What? You promised you weren't going down there.

397
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,500
I have a problem.

398
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,760
Yes, he's on the wrestling team, but that's a good thing.

399
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,100
I was on the wrestling team, and look how fine I turned out.

400
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,520
How dare you go behind my back

401
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,290
and encourage my delicious baby muffin to lie to me!

402
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,930
Bev, come on. It's not that big of a deal.

403
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,130
Let the boy wrestle.

404
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,430
Helen Cutler's son was in a wrestling match once

405
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,130
and his head popped right off

406
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,450
and now he lives his life as just a head.

407
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,890
There's no such thing as just a head!

408
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,380
You need organs to live.

409
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,760
Well, tell that to Helen Cutler

410
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,090
as she's carrying her son around the grocery store

411
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,110
Like a football.

412
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,510
Well, where's his heart?! You need a heart to function!

413
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
It's in his neck.

414
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,220
He's got a little neck with organs in it.

415
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,860
Oh, so now he's got a neck!

416
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,000
What else has he got?

417
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,930
Maybe a body?!

418
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,490
Everyone, shut up!

419
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,110
All my life, you've been treating me like a baby.

420
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,750
Well, guess what -- it stops now.

421
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,700
I'm a grown adult man and I'm gonna wrestle

422
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,740
and there's nothing you can do about it!

423
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,920
Nothing!

424
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,740
Despite my brother's goofy run, he'd made up his mind.

425
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,010
It was go time,

426
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,260
but Barry wasn't the only one ready for a fight.

427
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,270
There you are! You scared me to death!

428
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,510
Where were you?

429
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,010
Where were you?!

430
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,760
I asked you to do one thing -- stand!

431
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,010
Just stand there!

432
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,580
But you couldn't even do that!

433
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,140
And now I'll never see "Return of the jedi."

434
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,010
Oh, please, just to spite me?

435
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,700
Correct! You ruined "Star wars" for me.

436
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,210
From this point on, I'll have nothing to do with it.

437
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,160
Nothing!

438
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,180
Dang it! That's a collector's item!

439
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,750
But I don't care!

440
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,730
Why did I do this?

441
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,250
You made me lose control of my body.

442
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,190
You honestly want to know why I left?

443
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,350
I didn't want my friends to see me stand in line

444
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,930
at some space movie that I got blackmailed into

445
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,460
by my dumb kid brother.

446
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,760
I blackmailed you because it's the only way

447
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,320
to get you to spend time with me.

448
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,940
And I didn't used to just be your dumb kid brother.

449
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,270
I used to be your friend.

450
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,250
It had been a full day

451
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,250
since I banished "Star wars" from my life.

452
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,370
I was in a sarlacc pit of despair,

453
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,370
that is, until a certain princess rescued me.

454
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,710
Get up. Put this on.

455
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,820
We're going to that movie.

456
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,260
I told you I'm not seeing the Sunday matinee.

457
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,590
It's like wearing somebody else's wedding dress.

458
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,230
What does that even mean?

459
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,520
It doesn't matter. We're going today.

460
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,160
How?

461
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,060
Well, I told the theater manager what happened,

462
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,430
and he was incredibly sympathetic.

463
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,400
- He's gonna sneak us in. - Really?

464
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,170
I also said I would go to dinner with him and his grandparents.

465
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,640
I really wish I would have just stayed in line.

466
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,610
Meanwhile, my brother was ready to fight.

467
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,950
And according to Barry logic, if he won this match,

468
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,930
Lexy would never forget his name.

469
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,390
And even though he had a lot to lose,

470
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,550
it was my dad who had the butterflies.

471
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,900
How you doing, champ? You nervous?

472
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,490
I'm not nervous. Don't be nervous.

473
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,220
Uh, I'm a little nervous, not about the wrestling thing.

474
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,760
I'm just worried about my catchphrase

475
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,810
'cause once I say it, I can never take it back.

476
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,750
I was thinking, "Welcome to the mat."

477
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,620
No catchphrase.

478
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,240
Goldberg, quit trading recipes.

479
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,000
Let's go! You're up! Let's go, let's go!

480
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,160
Look alive! Come on!

481
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,750
This was it --

482
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The start of my brother's wrestling career,

483
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,900
and nothing was gonna stop him.

484
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,130
I said no!

485
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,300
Mom?

486
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,710
Are you kidding me right now? Move.

487
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,380
I will not move. I will never move.

488
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,610
You're my special boy.

489
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,240
If you end up being just a head,

490
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,930
then I have failed as a mother.

491
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,870
No.

492
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,050
No.

493
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,250
Barry! What did I say?

494
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,480
What did I say? What did --

495
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,320
Mom, Lexy Bloom is watching me right now.

496
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,850
What the hell are you doing?!

497
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,210
I'm saving your life.

498
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,790
Bevy, no!

499
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,980
I love you, honey!

500
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,720
I love you so much! I will never let you go!

501
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,450
Don't fight back! Go limp under mama!

502
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,690
And we're off the rails again.

503
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,170
- Dad, help me! She's so strong! - I'm trying!

504
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,520
- Tap out, Barry. - Barry, tap out!

505
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,220
- I'm tapping out! - Tap out, Barry!

506
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,900
You are a nightmare, okay?!

507
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,320
Now Lexy Bloom will never follow me to college

508
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,510
on a wrestling scholarship.

509
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,010
You have no right to be mad at me -- no right!

510
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,720
You're the one who lied and directly defied my orders.

511
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,280
- True story. - Oh, here we go!

512
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,920
- Susie Goodman's son defied her at one point. - I don't care!

513
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,440
How do you know so many sad people?!

514
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,740
And do you know that that resulted in his tragic --

515
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,980
Enough!

516
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,120
All right, Bevy,

517
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,380
no one loves a tragic parenting tale more than you.

518
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,390
Did you ever hear the one about Beverly Goldberg's son?

519
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,940
He got utterly dominated by her

520
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,110
in front of the whole school and was made a laughingstock.

521
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,180
Oh, my god.

522
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,100
That is kind of what happened, isn't it?

523
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,020
Honey, at a certain point,

524
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,180
you're only hurting them by holding them back.

525
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,610
Well, the damage is done.

526
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,520
Not yet.

527
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,530
What?

528
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,740
There is a way to make people forget

529
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,740
the terrible things they saw today,

530
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,100
and that's for you to go out and pulverize this kid

531
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,810
and show him why your catchphrase

532
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,580
is "Welcome to the mat!"...

533
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,490
Or something better that you think of

534
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,000
on your way out there.

535
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,240
And, Bevy, I will hold your hand through the whole thing.

536
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,070
Go get 'em, poopie.

537
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,870
That day my brother and I each opened a door

538
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,840
that would change our lives forever.

539
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,600
I'll always remember

540
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,670
stepping into my little hometown theater,

541
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,680
heart pounding,

542
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,200
knowing that I was about to watch pure magic,

543
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,690
and it was all thanks to my sister.

544
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,050
That's funny.

545
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,640
I was expecting to wrestle your mom.

546
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,390
Welcome to the mat!

547
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,990
All right, Goldberg!

548
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,310
I taught him that move!

549
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,750
He learned that from me!

550
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,910
More or less.

551
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,600
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

552
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,360
I've always wanted to be a wrestling mom!

553
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,170
I can't hear you?!

554
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,470
Goldberg can't hear you!

555
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,960
You know it, girl!

556
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,660
I'm tough, but gentle,

557
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,980
and we're gonna ride a horse into the sun.

558
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,300
Yeah! Yeah!

559
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,650
Okay, so my brother didn't go on

560
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,380
to become a famous professional wrestler named Goldberg.

561
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,660
Finishing move!

562
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,250
But in that moment, he felt invincible.

563
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,240
Oh, no, no, no! No! No!

564
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,520
Goldberg, it's over. It's over.

565
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,320
It's over. You won. You won.

566
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,520
Yeah!

567
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,830
There's nothing you remember more

568
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,450
than your childhood victories.

569
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,680
They stay with you forever.

570
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,800
And if you're lucky,

571
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,040
your family is right there with you.

572
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,510
Thank you so much.

573
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,430
Ask mom.

574
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,750
I've got some new wrestling moves.

575
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,990
Ask mom.

576
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,170
You're gonna love them.

577
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,770
The Hulkster can't hear you!

578
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,780
The Hulkster can't hear you!

579
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,390
The Hulkster can't hear you!

580
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,910
Oh, and he's raking his face against the ropes!

581
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,790
Oh, that can't be legal!

582
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,670
That just can't be legal!

583
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,270
Oh, no! He has a foreign object.

584
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,250
How's the referee not seeing this?

585
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,870
He's done! He's done!

586
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,590
World champion!

587
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,360
Still a moron.

589
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,180
It's the backbreaker slam!

590
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,630
Body slam!

591
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,930
Figure-four!
