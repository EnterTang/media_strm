11
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,200
It's a funny thing about dads --

12
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,590
They always tend to be creatures of habit.

13
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,030
At least, my father was.

14
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,970
He liked what he liked, and he hated change.

15
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,230
Ever since I can remember, he wore the same shoes,

16
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,030
He ate the same breakfast.

17
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,450
I'm home!

18
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,240
Don't anybody bother me!

19
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,660
And every day, he'd come home at 5:15,

20
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,460
park his pants at the door, sit in the same chair,

21
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,630
and watch the same show.

22
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,210
If you tried to change anything,

23
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,760
he'd fight you tooth and nail.

24
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,400
That's why my mom created the illusion

25
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,600
everything stayed the same, but it wasn't.

26
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,090
That magical pair of shoes that never wore out --

27
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,750
She secretly replaced them every eight months.

28
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,590
That laissez-faire attitude about his personal grooming --

29
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,340
She tended to that, too.

30
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,840
She even managed to switch him

31
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,390
to low-fat cream cheese without him noticing.

32
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,480
This tastes funny.

33
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,020
- No, it doesn't. - Okay.

34
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,020
Yep, Beverly Goldberg had always been the puppet master,

35
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,340
And my dad had no idea.

36
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,740
Beverly!

37
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,810
That is, until the day she got a new chair.

38
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,720
Beverly! Beverly goldberg!

39
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,180
What the hell is sitting where my chair should be?

40
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,680
Surprise!

41
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,560
I thought it was time for an upgrade.

42
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,210
Don't you just love it?

43
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,870
Where's my chair -- the one I've been sitting in for 20 years?

44
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,170
I donated it to goodwill.

45
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,920
Without telling me?! Why would you do that?!

46
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,690
Honey, you're always complaining about how your back hurts.

47
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,030
It's that old chair.

48
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,430
You never liked that chair.

49
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,290
You've always been jealous of what we've had together.

50
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,520
"We"? Who's "We"?

51
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,460
Me and mr. Chair. That's right, it had a name.

52
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,770
Well, it's not a very good one.

53
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,170
Mine is top-of-the-line.

54
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,430
You're gonna love how comfy it is.

55
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,680
It's so spongy.

56
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,420
Honey, you're gonna have to trust me on this.

57
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,230
I bought it for your own good.

58
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,420
I can't breathe. Can't breathe.

59
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,630
Well, stop sitting like that.

60
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,440
You're sitting uncomfortably on purpose.

61
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,930
It's engulfing me.

62
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,730
Stop it!

63
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,620
Those are exaggerated body movements.

64
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,350
It was March 7, 1980-something.

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,630
And like every day, I rode the bus.

66
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,390
Back then, this was the wild west --

67
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,670
No seatbelts, no security cameras,

68
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,650
no one to stop the one dude who made your life miserable.

69
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,940
For me, it was an eighth grader named J.C. Spink.

70
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,990
Look who it is -- Adam Gold-nerd.

71
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,680
He may have been tiny, but he was terrible.

72
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,850
Can you please lay off today, J.C.?

73
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,640
I forgot my gym shorts and had to run the mile in jeans.

74
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,970
I have a really bad chafe.

75
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,920
Oh, man. I am so sorry to hear that.

76
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,740
Hey, everybody.

77
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,450
Adam has got some sting-y thighs.

78
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,850
So if I see one spitball hit this kid,

79
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,330
you will have to deal with me.

80
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,280
Thanks, dude. That's -- that's really --

81
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,350
Everybody get their asses in their seats --

82
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,180
Especially you, Spink!

83
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,530
Yes, sir.

84
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,320
Mind if we share?

85
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,690
I was plastered up against that window for the next 20 minutes.

86
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,950
And then I saw Barry doing what he did best -- flipping out.

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,360
No! No! No, no, no!

88
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,250
What the hell is his deal?

89
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,590
Where the hell is my Sports Illustrated football phone?!

90
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,860
Damn it. Where?! Where?! Where?!

91
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,240
- Unreal! Unreal! - That's my big brother, Barry.

92
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,460
He's clinically insane.

93
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,860
For real?

94
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,020
The doctors gave up on him.

95
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,270
He's too crazy for their modern medicine.

96
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,580
Where is my phone?!

97
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,210
And if you don't back off, I'm bringing him on this bus,

98
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,610
and he'll smear you against a window.

99
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,610
J.C. was running scared.

100
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,500
Now I just had to get Barry on board.

102
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,380
Unfortunately, he was a little preoccupied

103
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,760
with more urgent matters.

104
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,050
The dude on tv said

105
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,510
my football phone would be here in eight weeks.

106
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,670
It's been 10!

107
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,320
I mean, what am I supposed to do, huh?

108
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,280
Make phone calls on a phone-shaped phone

109
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,650
like some kind of animal?

110
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,750
I say good day to you, sir.

111
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,090
Rough stuff, man.

112
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,040
I can see you're going through a lot.

113
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,160
Speaking of difficult problems,

114
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,270
is there any way you would start

115
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,930
riding the bus to school with me again?

116
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,340
Why would I ride the bus with you

117
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,310
when I carpool with Erica 

118
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,630
and her smoking-hot friend Lainey

119
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,860
who secretly loves me but is too afraid to act on it?

120
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,930
Look.

121
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,060
There's this kid who's making my life hell.

122
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,110
And if you were there, he'd leave me alone.

123
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,530
I do have an air of badass about me.

124
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,530
So you'll do it?

125
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,790
I've given it a lot of thought,

126
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,660
and I'm respectfully declining your stupid-ass invitation.

127
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,700
Please! I'm begging you!

128
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,450
I'll give you all my garbage pail kids.

129
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,980
See? They're like baseball cards, but hilarious.

130
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,050
One day, these will be worth millions.

131
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,790
They're not.

132
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,740
All right. Fine. Whatever. I'm in.

133
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,240
- For real? - Listen, bro.

134
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,750
You're literally the most annoying, un-athletic,

135
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,670
four-eyed, almost girl-like dork I've ever met.

136
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,490
But you're my brother, and no one beats you up but me.

137
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,040
I was touched, insulted, and kind of angry,

138
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,010
But I'd gotten what I wanted.

139
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,710
No, stop!

140
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,280
Once the chair molds to your body, there's no going back!

141
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,540
- It's imprinted to you for life! - Wha?

142
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,780
The first 48 hours are the most important.

143
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,390
Get up! Get up!

144
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,410
Aw, damn it.

145
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,440
Now it's got your tiny girl imprint.

146
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,410
This is truly the worst thing to ever happen to me.

147
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,930
Okay. I'm gonna leave you to whatever this is.

148
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,270
What is that pitch?!

149
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,380
- I see you! - Oh, crap!

150
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,180
Don't make me get up!

151
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,110
I don't like getting up!

152
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,890
- Get the hell outta here! - Run!

153
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,780
His beloved chair was gone, and my dad was livid,

154
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,880
So he decided to strike back where she'd feel it most --

155
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,270
The kitchen.

156
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,660
What is this? W-what's happening?

157
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,720
Where's my stove?

158
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,400
Surprise!

159
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,830
Don't you love it?!

160
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,650
Murray, where is my stove?

161
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,440
You know, you're always complaining

162
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,520
about slaving away in the kitchen,

163
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,660
so I got you a gift.

164
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,070
Dinner's in a half an hour.

165
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,050
What the hell am I supposed to cook with?

166
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,250
The microwave -- a new miracle of technology

167
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,030
that magically cooked food in a tenth of the time.

168
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,580
And, man, did it boil my mom.

169
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,080
My god. How does it work?

170
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,050
I know you're gonna think I'm crazy when I say this.

171
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,000
Magic.

172
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,570
- I'd buy that. - Totally. I agree.

173
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,240
It's not magic, people.

174
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,830
It's an evil food box.

175
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,710
Hot. It's hot. It's hot.

176
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,150
Popcorn in four minutes!

177
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,750
A cure for polio, a man on the moon, 

178
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,730
and now this.

179
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,390
Hey! Are you nuts?

180
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,240
That food's been radiated. It's like poison in a bag.

181
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,490
Bev, I did this for your own good.

182
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,300
That small wonder over there

183
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,230
is gonna make your life so much better.

184
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,260
You're playing a very dangerous game.

185
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,860
Are you sure you want to take me on?

186
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,870
Oh, I'm sure --

187
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,600
In honor of my fallen comrade, mr. Chair.

188
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,320
Your fallen comrade smelled like an envelope full of farts!

189
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,170
I just heated up a lasagna

190
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,100
in the time it took for your relationship to collapse.

191
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,870
While my mom was trying not to go nuclear,

192
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,480
things were about to blow up on the bus.

193
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,170
Hey, Gold-nerd!

194
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,410
Look whose brother didn't show up.

195
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,740
Time for target practice.

196
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,420
I think it's time you leave my little brother alone

197
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,120
or I'll spit at you...

198
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,400
Without a ball!

199
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,710
It'll be all spit.

200
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,900
No ball?

201
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,270
C-come on, man. That's crazy.

202
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,700
That's right.

203
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,810
And there's a good chance I have mono,

204
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,260
'cause I sleep an insane amount.

205
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,920
Listen up, little bus people.

206
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,700
There's a new sheriff in town,

207
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,470
and his name is Barry Norman Goldberg.

208
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,480
If you have anything to say to my little bro,

209
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,430
you say it to me first.

210
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,520
Except you, Tyler. You can speak to me directly.

211
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,240
He's cool. We were in "Pippin" together.

212
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,820
I am quite the song-and-dance man.

213
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,470
Tyler, not helping!

214
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,850
Beat it, loser.

215
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,760
I couldn't believe it.

216
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,230
After years of torturing me,

217
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,760
Barry actually came to my rescue.

218
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,870
Dude, thank you.

219
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,010
No problem.

220
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,990
Now give me your lunch.

221
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,250
Being awesome makes me hungry.

222
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,190
You're supposed to use the spreader.

223
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,610
Consider it used.

224
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,390
And just like that, my new bodyguard became my new bully.

225
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,040
And at home, my mom and dad's battle had become a war.

226
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,190
His tightie-whitie drawer had been invaded by boxers.

227
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,090
Here you go, sweetie.

228
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,740
Straight out of the radioactive heat box.

229
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,740
It's like eating egg-flavored newspaper.

230
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,510
All right, we need to talk.

231
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,500
Oh, morning, sweetie.

232
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,130
Would you like some microwaved egg rubber?

233
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,300
No. I would like my underpants back.

234
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,400
Oh, well, you're holding them.

235
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,850
No, no. These are not my underpants.

236
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,380
Mine are white, tight, and they keep the fellas in place.

237
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,290
Not hungry.

238
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,160
Well, now you have boxers.

239
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,960
You know, scientific research shows

240
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,040
that you need to let your privates breathe,

241
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,120
especially if we're gonna have more kids one day.

242
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,200
First, I will never wear shorts under my pants.

243
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,410
It's madness!

244
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,400
And second, having more children

245
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,960
is literally my worst nightmare!

246
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,540
You'll understand when you have horrible kids.

247
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,160
Sweetie, I'm only doing this for your own good.

248
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,960
You want war?

249
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,350
You got one.

250
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,520
My mom thought she had struck the death blow

251
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,880
by taking away my dad's tightie-whities.

252
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,970
Little did she know, things were about to get ugly --

253
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,900
- Real ugly. - Well, well.

254
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,150
- Look who finally came around on the boxers. - Nope.

255
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,210
- But you're dressed for work. - Yep.

256
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,300
- So everything's just all free in there? - Yep.

257
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,740
No!

258
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,690
You're an adult man in society. You need another layer!

259
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,860
People won't see it, but they'll sense it.

260
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,680
You wanted my boys to breathe.

261
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,450
Well, they're taking a big breath.

262
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,960
That's right. The three amigos, they're dining alfresco.

263
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,540
Have a nice day.

264
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,860
Why are you patting my head? What's happening?

265
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,020
Nothing. Nothing at all.

266
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,660
What did you do? What did you do?

267
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,280
Holy

268
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,310
Where's my aqua net?

269
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,500
Oh, your can of hair spray!

270
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,440
Yeah.

271
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,740
I got rid of it for your own good.

272
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,230
Did you know it's burning a hole in the ozone layer?

273
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,520
I don't want to hear about some imaginary layer in the sky.

274
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,490
I'm leading a PTA meeting in 30 minutes,

275
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,120
and I need to command respect with my giant hair!

276
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,710
You get me the chair, I'll give you the hair.

277
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,880
Oh, you think you beat me on this?

278
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,020
Well, our daughter has a whole arsenal of hair products,

279
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,290
and she has been dying to give me a new look.

280
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,940
Oh, my god. What did I just hear? Is this real?

281
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,210
Are we finally getting rid of that terrible blonde helmet?

282
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,590
Okay, close your eyes. I'm doing your bangs. 

283
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,800
This is gonna be totally rad. 

284
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,090
How's it looking?

285
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,570
Really, really awesome.

286
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,540
- I know! - Oh, my god!

287
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,410
- I know! - How did this happen?!

288
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,860
I don't know!

289
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,980
It fried my hair!

290
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,740
Like, really quickly. It's so unhealthy.

291
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,890
It's like you have a head full of sagebrush.

292
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,410
- I know! - Oh, my god!

293
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,500
What are we gonna do about this?!

294
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,080
Okay. Okay. Let's take a chill pill.

295
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,220
I know I can fix this.

296
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,300
Hi, PTA.

297
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,900
Let's talk spring fling.

298
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,120
What's with your hair?

299
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,670
Don't look at it, Karen.

300
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,250
Afternoon, friends.

301
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,150
You're all looking particularly small today, huh?

302
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,260
Hey, Tyler.

303
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,650
Cool frisbee.

304
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,270
My frisbee.

305
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,250
Yo, Spinkter.

306
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,700
Give me those cheese doodles.

307
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,960
Just take them, Barry.

308
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,790
Who's this Barry you speak off?

309
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,810
Take them...

310
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,590
Bus lord.

311
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,800
That's right.

312
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,320
My plan for a bodyguard had backfired,

313
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,350
and now it was up to me to banish our evil bus lord.

314
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,720
You know, I think I got this bus stuff handled,

315
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,590
so it's probably time you go back and ride

316
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,350
with Erica and her smoking-hot friends.

317
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,340
Dude, I'm never going back.

318
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,290
This bus is mine now. It's my home.

319
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,340
Now, leave me be. I find you boring.

320
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,690
Stop!

321
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,350
What just happened on your shirt?

322
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,360
Oh, it's hypercolor.

323
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,940
The color changes when you touch it.

324
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,330
I bought it with my lawn-mowing money.

325
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,390
- I want it. - What? No!

326
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,640
You'll stretch it out.

327
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,990
Good point.

328
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,870
Then you will use your hard-earned money

329
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,430
to buy me one that accommodates my muscular body.

330
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,240
Your brother's a real ass-bag.

331
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,180
Yes. Yes, he is.

332
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,260
This whole thing's been a very eye-opening experience.

333
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,710
I'm sorry for the way I treated you.

334
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,230
It won't happen again.

335
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,570
What do you say we get Barry off this bus for good?

336
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,510
There's no way.

337
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,330
Oh, there's always a way.

338
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,880
Okay, look, everybody. Come here.

339
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,960
We all know where we sit on this bus.

340
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,820
Some of us are back-row material.

341
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,940
Some, like me, kind of float in the middle.

342
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,360
A few of us totally suck and sit in the front.

343
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,360
But for once,

344
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,490
let's forget about what row we sit in.

345
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,030
For once, let's work together and take back our bus!

346
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,940
- Now who's with me? - I am!

347
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,560
Damn it, Tyler.

348
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,950
You scared the crap out of me.

349
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,700
But I love the enthusiasm.

350
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,910
Whoa, stop!

351
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,640
Don't park your pants at the door.

352
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,620
Rumor has it you're going alfresco.

353
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,480
Oh, damn it. I forgot. I miss my underpants.

354
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,050
Ah, you'll get used to it.

355
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,710
I've been going alfresco since the '70s.

356
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,400
My dad didn't think he could miss anything

357
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,990
more than his tightie-whities.

358
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,280
Boy, was he wrong.

359
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,600
What the hell?

360
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,950
Tv's gone, Mur.

361
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,200
Yeah, I see that.

362
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,240
Beverly took it.

363
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,430
I figured that.

364
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,590
- You lost the war, pal. - Stop talking.

365
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,280
You know, I' bven watching these fish for 10 minutes,

366
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,550
and I got to tell you, it's some entertaining stuff.

367
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,560
These two fish, they're complete opposites.

368
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,680
They'll never get along, but they have to.

369
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,480
They live in close quarters.

370
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,620
Stop talking!

371
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,600
Isn't it great?

372
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,730
It's like being in the lobby of a Benihana.

373
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,480
And the best part about it is

374
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,750
you need to constantly tend to it.

375
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,880
Getting rid of the tv, that's nuts.

376
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,930
That's the glue that holds this family together.

377
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,980
Everyone know that tv strains your eyes.

378
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,470
I did this for your own good.

379
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,620
Don't do anything for my own good, okay?

380
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,040
I'm fine. I don't need your help.

381
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,890
Really? Do you know how many things I do for you,

382
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,910
things you don't even know anything about?

383
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,200
So sue me if I want you

384
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,080
to sit in a chair that's not a disgusting fart trap

385
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,380
that ruins the scheme of my entire living room.

386
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,160
Right there! You did it for you.

387
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,810
What?

388
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,800
That hurts your back -- a chair that hurts your back.

389
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,060
Too late. You said it.

390
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,690
Yes, that chair may be old,

391
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,170
but it's because I-I sit in it, I sleep in it, I eat in it,

392
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,650
I even raised our children from it.

393
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,240
I know you do a lot for me.

394
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,130
You do, and I love you for it.

395
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,460
But you didn't get rid of that chair for me.

396
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,850
You got rid of that chair for you.

397
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,670
Things were still hell on the bus,

398
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,380
and now our evil emperor had new clothes.

399
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,180
Step aside.

400
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,400
Hands off the hypercolor.

401
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,050
Don't touch the bod.

402
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,120
What are you doing? Move.

403
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,830
Nah. I don't think I'm gonna do that.

404
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,190
This isn't a request.

405
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,300
Either you do it or I'll throw you off the bus.

406
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,850
That's where you're wrong, dude.

407
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,410
This isn't your bus anymore.

408
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,490
Says who?

409
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,440
Says me.

410
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,730
You owe me a frisbee.

411
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,420
Let's get him!

412
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,810
Yeah!

413
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,350
Bye! 

414
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,600
Hands. 

415
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,900
There's so many hands.

416
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,990
While Barry was no longer king of the bus,

417
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,270
my mom was looking for my father's throne.

418
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,280
Uh, hi. I'm looking for a Mr. Nitrous.

419
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,420
This is he. And it's just Nitrous.

420
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,080
Mr. Nitrous is my dad.

421
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:03,800
That's nice.

422
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,420
Listen, I was just at the goodwill,

423
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,460
and I was told that you purchased something that I need.

424
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,150
That's my chair, sweetie.

425
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,270
No way, lady. I will never give you my chair.

426
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,600
This thing's my throne. It's shaped perfectly to my body.

427
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,790
Not your body, my husband's body,

428
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,730
which also is very similar to your body.

429
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,340
Let me just buy it back from you.

430
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,200
Name your price.

431
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,470
- Show me your boobs. - No!

432
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,150
- Then give me $1 million. - No.

433
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,290
- I'd very much like to revisit the boob conversation. - No.

434
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,570
- Show me your boobs. - No!

435
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,150
Then give me $1 million.

436
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,860
Okay, I feel like we're going in circles, Nitrous.

437
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,160
And if you ask me this house is full of boobs.

438
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,100
I'm looking at them.

439
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,050
And this place is a pigsty, and you're all dressed like slobs.

440
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,190
And when was the last time

441
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,680
one of you ate a meal with a vegetable?

442
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,560
It's been a long time.

443
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,570
Yeah. You don't need boobs. You need your laundry done.

444
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,590
You need your bed made.

445
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,060
You need to...Scour every surface in this house

446
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,730
before one of you gets a wicked staph infection.

447
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,190
It's just... We don't know how.

448
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,020
Mama's here, Nitrous.

449
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,810
While my mom cleaned up her mess with my dad,

450
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,340
I was hoping Barry would forgive my dirty work.

451
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,730
Hey, big news.

452
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,630
The mailman came. Special delivery for Big Tasty.

453
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,240
Wow! Great!

454
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,850
It's a phone! It's a football!

455
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,120
Whatever.

456
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,570
So, y-you finally got it. That's cool, right?

457
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,140
So that means we're cool, too, right?

458
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,080
You led a mutiny against me, dude.

459
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,630
We are most definitely not cool.

460
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,230
I didn't have a choice. You went mad with power!

461
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,990
Listen -- I know from the outside it may

462
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,220
seem like I have a perfect life, but the truth is

463
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,680
there are a lot of jerks at school

464
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,330
that aren't so nice to me.

465
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,750
It was cool to have a place where I had respect for once.

466
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,100
I...Didn't know that.

467
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,440
Here.

468
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,290
Take your garbage pail kids back.

469
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,030
You don't need to pay me to protect you.

470
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,960
I want to because you're my brother.

471
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,910
As for my mom, she got her hair back...Eventually.

472
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,060
Come on. Can't I give it one more try?

473
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,090
And most importantly, my dad got his chair back.

474
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,520
Oh, my god!

475
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,030
I can't believe it.

476
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,220
Don't thank me. I did it for your own good.

477
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,200
Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair!

478
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,360
Smells like beer.

479
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,050
- No, it doesn't. - Okay.

481
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,890
Erica!

482
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,250
I've been honking for forever.

483
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,420
We're gonna be late for school.

484
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,320
I overslept. Give me a second.

485
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,450
What's up, Lainey? Got some good news.

486
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,030
I'm gonna ride with you guys again.

487
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,440
Please.

488
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,750
Got some hypercolor there, huh?

489
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,130
Yeah. You, uh... Digging it?

490
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,770
Actually...

491
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,760
Yes, I am.

492
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,110
You're looking really good, Bar.

493
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,710
Got to be honest. Never thought of you this way.

494
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,550
Oh, no.

495
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,030
Is it hot in here?

496
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,200
Oh, yeah.

497
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,130
It's hot.

498
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,360
Lainey, stop messing with him. Let's go.

499
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,950
I knew she was messing with me.

500
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,120
I mean, come on. Do I look stupid?
