11
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,340
- What? - No hustle, no muscle!

12
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,070
Gym class in the '80s --

13
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,820
The shorts were super-short, the exercises dumb,

14
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,520
and the games were barbaric.

15
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,680
I know you're aiming for down there, Ryan,

16
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,890
but it's not cool!

17
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,130
Teams weren't assigned,

18
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,300
but handpicked with brutal honesty

19
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,330
and no consideration of a fragile adolescent's feelings.

20
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,170
Oh, god. This is not gonna be easy.

22
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,520
I'm gonna have to go with Small Wonder over there.

23
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,450
You're going down, "Goldnerd."

24
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,930
Sorry.

25
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,860
After years of thinking I had suffered through

26
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,070
every indignity gym class had to offer,

27
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,660
turns out the worst was yet to come.

28
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,250
The presidential fitness test --

29
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,600
Our great president, Ronald Reagan,

30
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,330
along with the predator himself,

31
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,510
Arnold schwarzenegger,

32
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,750
care enough about you to demand physical excellence.

33
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,600
Technically, Arnold wasn't the predator.

34
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,550
He was the prey.

35
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,810
Nobody cares, Goldfarb.

36
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,040
It's goldberg.

37
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,750
It's literally written on my shirt.

38
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,290
Good for you. Now, why is this test important?

39
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,850
America needs warriors to fight the evils of communism.

40
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,050
Tomorrow, that battle begins with the seven basic exercises,

41
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,000
which include the sit-and-reach, the mile run,

42
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,620
and the pull-up.

43
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,410
What if you can't do a pull-up?

44
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,490
I'm asking hypothetically for a friend

45
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,160
that couldn't make it today.

46
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,080
Name's Josh. You don't know him.

47
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,430
Well, if you are the kind of boy who is weak of will and spirit,

48
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,700
you don't have to do it.

49
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,890
Instead, you will join the girls in the flexed arm hang.

50
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,200
Josh is not gonna like that.

51
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,470
The news was bleak.

52
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,140
I was definitely screwed.

53
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,660
I mean, Josh was screwed.

54
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,560
Honey, it's so late.

55
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,410
Why are you sitting alone in the dark?

56
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,230
Oh, no. What's the matter?

57
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,000
Nothing.

58
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,680
Poopie, something's wrong.

59
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,890
There's a storm inside you,

60
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,040
and I'm not leaving till I see a little sunshine.

61
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,660
Why do you always say super-weird stuff like that?

62
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,190
Looks like someone needs a sugar shower.

63
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,310
All right. All right!

64
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,960
Stop! Stop!

65
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,340
If you must know,

66
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,710
the presidential fitness test is tomorrow,

67
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,090
and I'm gonna be the only guy doing the flexed arm hang

68
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,060
with the girls.

69
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,170
Say no more.

70
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,570
Mama will never, ever let anything

71
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,380
remotely uncomfortable happen to you.

72
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,290
I'll just write you a note and get you out of it.

73
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,940
- For real? - Absolutely.

74
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,110
Absolutely not.

75
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,440
Every kid in America has to take that test.

76
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,250
Well, w-what does that have to do with my Adam?

77
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,050
It's a rite of passage.

78
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,730
You can't get out of a rite of passage

79
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,450
with a note from your mom.

80
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,760
Fine! We get it. I won't write a note.

81
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,630
I'll write you a note.

82
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,300
Seriously?

83
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,160
I'm gonna hug you so hard right now,

84
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,200
I might break every bone in your body.

85
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,140
Come on, Adam.

86
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,380
Don't be scared. You can hug me harder than that.

87
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,370
Okay. How does this feel?

88
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,300
Mama will write you a note.

89
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,980
It was April 8, 1980-something.

90
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,620
Before e-mail and facetime,

91
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,310
the way to keep in touch with somebody

92
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,950
was by sending them an actual piece of paper

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,130
with writing on it!

94
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,060
Are you kidding me? Where are your pants?

95
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,660
My pen pal will be here any minute.

96
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,370
Doesn't having a pen pal come to your house

97
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,190
defeat the whole purpose of having a pen pal?

98
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,750
Fanny's just gonna be here for a few days.

99
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,850
You can suffer through by wearing bottoms.

100
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,630
And for the love of all that is holy,

101
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,660
be nice to the girl.

102
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,210
Why wouldn't I be nice to her?!

103
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,890
We speak the same language.

104
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,560
Mom, if he doesn't not wear his pants

105
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,920
and stop speaking french gibberish,

106
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,350
I will leave this house forever.

107
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,630
Come on, ambassador.

108
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,920
Let's get you some pants.

109
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,460
That means nothing!

110
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,940
What is this?

111
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,950
Why do you look like a bigger knob than usual?

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,380
'cause I saw that pic of your sexually charged french friend,

113
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,060
asnd I am not letting this amazing opportunity go to waste.

114
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,020
Oh, no.

115
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,290
Just because she's french

116
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,840
doesn't mean she'll make out with you.

117
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,680
I beg to differ, actually.

118
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,170
In my experience,

119
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,800
The french demoiselle is very adventurous.

120
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,890
What's her name again?

121
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,700
Fanny.

122
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,050
Oh, that's a lay-up.

123
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,800
- Score! - Pops!

124
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,570
What? She's named after a butt.

125
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,200
That's a green light if I ever saw one.

126
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,650
Erica, I'm gonna need your help.

127
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,340
Here's a bunch of phrases I need translated into her native tongue

128
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,110
so I can get a little of that native tongue.

129
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,610
"Girl, our countries have been at war too long.

130
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,170
Let's make peace and love together."

131
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,920
You know what? I will help you.

132
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,220
Nice.

133
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,700
I can tell by that smile we're on the same page.

134
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,260
You're gonna mess with him, aren't you?

135
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,340
Big time.

136
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,700
I don't know how he doesn't see

137
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,800
that kind of thing coming by now.

138
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,250
It's very upsetting.

139
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,440
While Erica was scheming against Barry,

140
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,870
my mom's scheme to get me out of gym class was in motion.

141
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,100
You have Osgood-"Shladder" disease?

142
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,200
Actually, it's pronounced "Schlotter,"

143
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,810
And there's an article attached.

144
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,100
My hamstrings and ligaments aren't keeping up with my bones.

145
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,550
I'm growing too fast.

146
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,860
You're growing too fast? Where?

147
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,960
I-it's all in the note.

148
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,190
You really expect me to believe

149
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,610
your mother wrote this note?

150
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,040
Yes, 'cause she actually did.

151
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,870
Son, did you ever see the movie "Red dawn"?

152
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,170
A million times.

153
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,350
Do you love movies? 'cause I love movies.

154
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,850
Let me ask you a question.

155
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,460
What are you gonna do when the Russki invaders

156
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,720
storm the suburbs of Philly?

157
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,810
Actually, I think they'd be more interested

158
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,610
in coastal cities and financial centers.

159
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,820
You're gonna have to fight

160
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,090
and use the skills you learned right here!

161
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,050
- Even the pull-up? - Especially the pull-up.

162
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,090
You'll need your upper-arm strength to bash skulls.

163
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,720
I don't want to... Bash skulls.

164
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,510
The kids in "Red dawn" didn't want to, either,

165
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,950
but they had to in order to survive.

166
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,980
So...Where are we with that note?

167
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,910
I just received an authentic, bona fide note

168
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,750
from mr. Goldfarb here

169
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,280
saying that he is physically unable

170
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,280
to complete the presidential fitness test.

171
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,580
So, I've decided to push the test one week

172
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,790
until he gets better.

173
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,890
Until then, we'll be running laps.

174
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,370
Mr. Goldfarb will stand here and watch.

175
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,150
Feel free to wish him a speedy recovery in your own way.

176
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,800
All right! Let's go!

177
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,610
Hoof it! Knees high!

178
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,920
You're so dead, Goldnerd.

179
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,190
Totally get it.

180
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,880
Oh, real nice, Lisa. Real nice.

181
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,400
Meanwhile, Erica's pen pal, Fanny, had arrived

182
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,690
and was getting the grand tour of the Goldberg home.

185
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,700
Fantastique.

186
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,060
'sup, Fanny?

187
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,480
Mi casa es su casa.

188
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,830
Hunk of your native bread?

190
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,070
Oh. Barree. Bonjour.

191
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,970
Hi.

192
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,680
Oh, here.

193
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,590
Use these cards I translated for you.

194
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,580
Start with this one. It says, "Welcome to our home.

195
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,530
It's really nice to have you here."

198
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,060
Good stuff. Great start.

199
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,140
Um, I know you want to do this next one.

200
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,840
It's "How you doing, girl?"

202
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,430
- She likes it. - Yeah, it's working. Don't stop now.

204
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,110
Okay...

205
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,860
It sounded like I said "Gary Coleman."

206
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,960
Weird.

207
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,950
Beautiful language.

208
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,800
Good night. Or should I say...

210
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,690
Let me tell you something, mr. and mrs. Goldfarb.

211
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,590
There are three things I hate in life --

212
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,220
My ex-wife, carrots, and lies.

213
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,590
Okay, why did I close my store and rush down here?

214
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,620
Because president Reagan asked me personally

215
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,150
through a xeroxed letter to oversee a fitness test

216
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,540
of his design.

217
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,590
And your son tried to get of it

218
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,730
with an absurd note...

219
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,610
That no parent would ever write.

220
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,880
I wrote the note.

221
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,950
Oh me.

222
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,900
It was a ridiculous test, Murray.

223
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,610
Since when is strength measured

224
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,980
by how many pull-ups a person can do?

225
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,520
You know what takes real strength?

226
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,220
Tackling the role of Levi

227
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,430
in "Joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat."

228
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,690
And Adam was scrumptious.

229
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,410
There's nothing wrong with my test, ma'am.

230
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,020
If Adam suffers from anything,

231
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,720
it is from a far more serious

232
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,370
and permanent condition called the wuss-bags.

233
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,610
My son may be unathletic and afraid of birds --

234
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,910
He's not afraid of all birds.

235
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,610
- I know, not all birds. - Not all birds.

236
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,000
But he's not a wuss.

237
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,170
Look, I am administering a test at the direct order

238
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,710
of the president of the United States.

239
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,900
If you want Adam out of it, get a note from him.

240
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,500
Then it's settled.

241
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,750
I'll see you back here on Monday.

242
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,140
What just happened?

243
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,910
She's gonna go get a note from the president.

244
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,100
Look out, mr. Reagan.

245
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,120
Beverly Goldberg's coming for you.

246
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,950
My mom's mission to track down the president had begun.

247
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,370
First stop -- Harrisburg, the state capital.

248
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,960
Hello. I'm pennsylvania citizen Beverly Goldberg,

249
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,260
And I'm here to speak to the governor.

250
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,320
This is the comptroller's office.

251
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,480
Great. Then I'll speak to the comptroller.

252
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,610
A-a-and what does this pertain to?

253
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,380
The presidential fitness test.

254
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,140
And the comptroller can help how?

255
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,760
He can put me in touch with the governor,

256
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,530
who can put me in touch with the president

257
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,860
so I can get my son out of gym class.

258
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,280
Question -- do you have any idea what a-a comptroller does?

259
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,240
Of course.

260
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,590
He comptrols the great state of Pennsylvania,

261
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,670
and I need him to get me to the man who comptrols america.

262
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,750
Here's a thing -- uh, "Comptrol,"

263
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,610
The way you're using it, isn't a word.

264
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,910
- Yes, it is. - No. No, it's not.

265
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,930
- It is. - Not really.

266
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,180
- Yeah, it is. - Definitely not a word --

267
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,040
Straight-up not a word.

268
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,240
Uh, but I get the sense you're not gonna leave,

269
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,190
So here's what I'm gonna do.

270
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,390
There's a guy in the state assembly's office

271
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,220
who screwed over my sister.

272
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,710
I think he should meet you.

273
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,550
Sound good?

274
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,320
Sounds great.

275
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,940
Now, I'm just gonna write down these directions,

276
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,530
and when you see him, just tell him,

277
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,540
"Jill's brother says hi."

278
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,270
Thank you for taking comptrol of the situation.

279
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,590
- Not a word. - Yes, it is.

280
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,520
Meanwhile, my brother was working on

281
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,750
his french connection.

282
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,240
Good morning, mon cherie.

283
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,250
Hello, Barree.

284
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,230
Getting into this right away, huh, Barry?

285
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,140
What? I'm just showing her a traditional american breakfast.

286
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,080
Fanny, this is called a pop-tart.

287
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,920
In America, we eat our fruit inside bread --

288
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,280
for you.

289
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,290
Merci.

290
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,350
You know what else goes down easy in the morning?

291
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,570
Rap music.

292
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,640
Erica, you translated my masterpiece, right?

293
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,290
Every word.

294
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,370
It's called "Mon lit."

295
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,010
It means "My bed."

303
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,180
Enough. I'm sorry. I have to stop this.

304
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,960
- It's too far. - You speak french?

305
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,050
How many times do I have to tell you this?

306
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,910
I was in the war. I helped liberate France.

307
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,010
That was real?

308
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,580
I'm confused. What's happening?

309
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,720
The song -- it's about peeing in your bed.

310
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,340
That wasn't your intention, right?

311
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,350
No! No.

312
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,830
It had the word "Pee-pee" In it, like, a lot.

313
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,730
What the hell, Erica?

314
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,880
I asked you for your help, and you made a fool of me?

315
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,830
I told you not to hit on my friend.

316
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,950
I mean, did you actually think you had a chance with her?

317
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,860
I don't know!

318
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,160
I mean, the girls here don't get me at all,

319
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,380
So I thought someone from another country might.

320
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,190
Now you ruined that, too.

321
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,390
While Barry had lost faith in romance,

322
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,390
I still had faith in my mom.

323
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,400
Has mom come back from the president's house yet?

324
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,850
Are you kidding? No.

325
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,010
Have you checked the answering machine?

326
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,200
Maybe mr. Reagan left a message or something.

327
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,390
You know, the president's a very busy man.

328
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,640
He might not have time to help one little boy

329
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,180
get out of gym class.

330
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,320
He likes jelly beans.

331
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,780
No, no, h-he's got a fun side,

332
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,580
but I think you might want to consider

333
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,580
that your mom's not gonna come through on this.

334
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,080
I know it's a bit of a long shot,

335
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,110
but she's never let me down before.

336
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,170
And then something happened more surprising

337
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,030
than my mom getting a note from the president.

338
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,810
Come here, buddy. I want to talk to you.

339
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,890
My dad decided to open up to me.

340
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,850
You know why I...Really want you to take this test?

341
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,450
You need an outlet for your hostility?

342
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,450
No! Stop aggravating me!

343
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,510
I'm trying to help you here, man.

344
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,650
Okay, I'm gonna tell you something

345
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,740
your brother and sister don't know.

346
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,720
I played a lot of sports in high school,

347
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,940
but there was one thing I could never do -- swim.

348
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,270
- What? - Yeah.

349
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,810
I grew up in the city. Where would I learn?

350
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,330
Well, you could take the bus to the beach,

351
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,870
or there's summer camps.

352
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,500
The ymca has a very nice program.

353
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,420
How about I talk, you listen?

354
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,450
I tried everything in my power

355
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,640
to get out of that swim class

356
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,570
'cause I knew if I got in the pool,

357
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,670
I'd humiliate myself in front of everybody.

358
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,610
So, what did you do?

359
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,650
I got in that damn pool!

360
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,260
At first, I was embarrassed,

361
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,140
but by the end of the semester,

362
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,980
I-I developed quite a mean backstroke.

363
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,820
- Really? - Yeah!

364
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,630
You don't have to be the best.

365
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,450
You just got to try.

366
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,080
Well, since you were an athlete back in the day,

367
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,020
maybe you could help me with my pull-ups.

368
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,010
Let's get to work. Come on!

369
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,000
Let's do this.

370
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,760
I did it.

371
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,550
I got a note from the president

372
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,230
of the United States of America.

373
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,590
Actually, it's from the secretary

374
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,520
to the undersecretary to the president,

375
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,650
who's the best friend of the lieutenant governor's cousin

376
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,200
who just wanted to get me out of the office,

377
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,650
But it's got the presidential seal,

378
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,770
so it's official.

379
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,650
Wow. But no.

380
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,540
Adam and I just had a talk,

381
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,680
and he understands the importance of just trying.

382
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,690
I'll take the note! I'll take the note.

383
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,450
Mom, you're the best.

384
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,240
I'll see you around the tv sometime.

385
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,510
And, just like that,

386
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,320
I had a presidential pardon from fitness.

387
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,770
Fanny just left for the airport.

388
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,360
You didn't want to say goodbye?

389
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,960
What's the point?

390
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,880
She thinks I'm a bed-wetting loser thanks to you.

391
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,310
Actually, I don't think she does.

392
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,030
Look, she left you this note.

393
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,700
Oh, no! I don't read french!

394
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,180
Right. But I do.

395
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,960
"Barry, sorry I was so weird around you.

396
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,810
American boys intimidate me,

397
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,540
especially the ones who are so good at sports,

398
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,020
nunchucking, and frisbee."

399
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,990
She knows about my frisbee skills?

400
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,530
Did she write about the sketch I gave her

401
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,830
of us riding a dolphin?

402
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,670
No.

403
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,520
But she did say if you're ever in paris, look her up.

404
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,720
- Does it really say that? - Yes.

405
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,710
It does. I-it really does.

406
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,360
Looks like she was into you, kiddo.

407
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,910
I'm not surprised. I'm irresistible.

408
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,520
This is a thank-you note to your parents.

409
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,440
Well, I felt sorry for the big dope.

410
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,210
No, you care about him.

411
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,140
Maybe a little.

412
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,510
Well, it was a nice thing to do.

413
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,110
It was, but unfortunately, it led to this.

414
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,220
I've got to stop that plane!

415
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,600
I'm coming, Fanny!

416
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,790
I'm coming for you!

417
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,570
Thanks to my mom, I was free.

418
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,700
And even so, I could hear my dad's voice

419
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,920
ringing in my head.

420
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,100
Adam, I really think you should take this test.

421
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,430
Turns out it actually was my dad.

422
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,200
Dad, what are you doing here?

423
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,410
I came here to tell you something.

424
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,840
I can't swim.

425
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,780
But you said you --

426
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,960
I know what I said... But I lied.

427
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,000
I cut that class, and I-I never learned how.

428
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,520
It's the biggest regret of my life,

429
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,750
and I don't want you growing up

430
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,090
having the same regrets I do.

431
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,350
Goldfarb, get your ass in here!

432
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,770
I may never be able to swim,

433
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,280
but I know you can do one pull-up.

434
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,440
All right, Goldfarb. Ready for the flexed arm hang?

435
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,150
No. Today, I'm doing pull-ups.

436
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,270
You can't park there.

437
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,600
It's okay. I'm here to see a girl. I'm in love.

438
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,460
You got it, chief. That's how the world works.

439
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,840
We need a tow truck at terminal 3.

440
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,540
It's -- it's okay. It's okay.

441
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,980
I just have a pocket knife.

442
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,480
All right, go ahead. You're good.

443
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Let's go, Goldfarb. The president is waiting.

444
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,760
Attaboy!

445
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,080
- Yes! Whoo! - Yeah!

446
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,120
My lord,

447
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,610
that was the ugliest pull-up I've ever seen.

448
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,930
You'll still get killed in the first wave of attacks,

449
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,860
but maybe, just maybe,

450
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,010
you'll take a couple of those

451
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,980
commie bastards with you.

452
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,460
Well done, Goldberg.

453
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,800
Last call for flight 612 to paris, France.

454
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,520
Wait -- hold the plane!

455
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,410
Fanny!

456
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,790
Fanny.

458
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,900
Stop telling me you love me.

459
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,780
It's not meant to be.

460
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,920
I have to stay here

461
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,050
and become an american sports and music icon.

462
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,780
But we'll always have pop-tarts, Fanny.

465
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,820
We'll always have pop-tarts.

467
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,020
She kissed me.

468
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,560
Twice.

469
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,690
Two french kisses.

472
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,770
Okay, that's enough. No more. I like his little baby arms.

473
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,680
I'm gonna chew on those arms!

474
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,510
Oh! Tickle, tickle!

475
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,370
Will you stop it? What do you do that for?

476
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,550
I love him so much.

477
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,110
Okay, I tackled my fear.

478
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,350
now it's your turn.

479
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,720
Kick. Kick. Use your legs.

480
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,690
- I'm kicking. - See, you're doing it.

481
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,120
- I'm doing it! - Keep on going.

482
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,330
All right.

483
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,190
Come on, give it all you got.

484
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,920
Come on. A little bit.

485
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,170
Yes!

486
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,800
Has anyone seen my car?

487
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,180
I know the sign says you can't park there,

488
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,920
but it's okay 'cause I'm in love.

491
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,520
Hasta la vista, baby.
