11
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,680
Hocky, a time honor tradition Goldberg's games.

12
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,690
my dad raised us watching the Flyers,

14
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,390
dreamed us beem as cool and tough as the broad street bullies.

15
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,760
Of course, what I lacked in size and strength,

16
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,400
I made up for with clumsiness and asthma.

17
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,350
My costume is so uncomfortable.

18
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,750
It's a jersey, not a costume.

19
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,680
Geez.

20
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,650
It didn't matter I was total scrub,

21
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,850
my dad thought I could be great someday.

22
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,480
I didn't want let him down.

23
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,780
- You ready? - Hell yeah.

24
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,700
I'm ready to hockey it up.

25
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,160
There he is, my little ice angel.

26
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,980
Remember our rule -- the real winner is safety.

27
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,190
It's the big leagues, Bevy.

28
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,040
He's in junior peewee now.

29
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,400
This is the year that Adam scores his first goal.

30
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,130
Murray, I don't understand why you insist he plays.

31
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,240
Adam, be careful on that ice. It's very slippery.

32
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,040
Why don't you just skate around with him all game

33
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,260
and make sure he stays safe?

34
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,150
I know you're joking, but I would do that

35
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,160
if the situation presented itself.

36
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,940
Hockey wasn't my thing, but it was Barry's everything.

37
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,420
Whoo! What a hit!

38
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,870
I don't think he's getting up.

39
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,200
I told you -- Flyers got to hit to win.

40
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,690
I'm Freddy Krueger!

41
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,530
I'm gonna haunt your dreams, fool!

42
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,820
- What's he doing? - Just ignore him.

43
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,440
He'll wear himself out.

44
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,340
That's enough. That's enough.

45
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,050
Let me watch the game. Stop.

46
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,570
Just watch the game, Adam.

47
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,190
My dad took hockey very seriously,

48
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,000
And my brother, Barry, did, too.

49
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,150
Out of all the things he thought he was good at,

50
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,680
this one he actually was.

51
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,070
Goal!

52
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,320
And my dad loved going to his games.

53
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,540
Look at you! Look at you!

54
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,860
But when it came to my games, not so much.

55
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,110
Go, Adam!

56
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,210
Even so, my dad dragged his ass to those stands to cheer me on.

57
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,820
No, no! The other way!

58
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,100
But he never stopped believing

59
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,470
that one day I would score that first goal

60
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,460
and live up to the Goldberg potential.

61
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,520
Do something!

62
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,310
Then, it finally happened.

63
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,030
My moment -- my big shot to make my dad proud.

64
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,680
Or so I thought.

65
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,630
Yes! I finally scored!

66
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,420
Yeah.

67
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,030
Damn it, Goldberg. You scored on our goal.

68
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,270
I call a do-over!

69
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,330
That's a thing in sports, right?

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,450
It was February 25, 1980-something.

71
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,250
My sister was prepping for the S.A.T.S,

72
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,970
and my mom was gonna be there every step of the way

73
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,420
with words of support and encouragement.

74
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,120
Okay, I don't want to make a big deal about this,

75
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,120
but your entire life

76
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,120
is literally riding on this one test.

77
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,120
You've made that very clear.

78
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,830
Now stop hovering.

79
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,600
Sorry. I'll just be quietly over here.

80
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,020
What the hell?

81
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,640
This test is all about how you handle distraction.

82
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,120
Focus your mind.

83
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,360
Shut out the world.

84
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,620
Mom.

85
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,010
I don't think there are going to be

86
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,800
any explosions at the test center.

87
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,970
You don't know that.

88
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,570
It could be underneath a discotheque,

89
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,420
or next to a fireworks factory,

90
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,280
or in a bad part of south Philly,

91
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,700
like where your gym teacher got arrested.

92
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,880
You're not helping.

93
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,410
And time! Pencils down.

94
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,630
Okay, you didn't even answer the last 10 questions.

95
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,370
- What's wrong with you? - You're what's wrong with me!

96
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,640
You know what?

97
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,250
That's fine. I'm done for the night.

98
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,840
The night has just begun, missy.

99
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,340
Tuchus down, now.

100
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,710
Look, my S.A.T. tutor said that taking

101
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,060
too many practice tests will burn you out.

102
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,930
And that's why I fired her.

103
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,320
You fired Wendy Woo?

104
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,140
I fired Wendy Woo.

105
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,560
She was happy and kind and patient --

106
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,990
Three terrible qualities in a tutor.

107
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,800
But don't worry. I hired someone else.

108
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,880
She'll be here momentarily.

109
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,460
What? What's happening?

110
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,920
- Surprise! - No.

111
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,010
It's me! I'm your new tutor!

112
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,540
Stop doing what you're doing.

113
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,760
Erica, the fate of your college career

114
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,370
rides on this one single test, and trust me,

115
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,270
I know how important college is.

116
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,150
The biggest regret of my life is dropping out to have you.

117
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,880
Oh, that sounded awful.

118
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,420
I am just gonna keep on talking until it fixes itself.

119
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,120
- Has it fixed itself? - No.

120
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,060
I think it has. Here.

121
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,870
I've gone through tests from the past 10 years

122
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,390
and compiled all the most difficult math problems.

123
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,610
Do them now.

124
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,240
What? These are way too hard.

125
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,870
I believe in you.

126
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,800
While my mom was turning the screws on Erica,

127
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,660
my dad had given up on me.

128
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,960
What are you doing? The Flyers are on.

129
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,650
I got news for you, Albert.

130
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,890
I'm done with hockey. That's right.

131
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,860
Adam spoiled the whole sport for me.

132
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,070
It happens.

133
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,380
Sometimes the puck deflects off you

134
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,480
and ricochets into your own goal.

135
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,730
No. He aimed. He shot.

136
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,670
He scored. He danced!

137
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,170
I'm so sorry.

138
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,540
Why don't you just let the boy quit?

139
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,680
He hates hockey.

140
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,550
For now.

141
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,440
But when I force him to play against his will,

142
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,260
he'll eventually become great.

143
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,990
And then his bitterness towards me will turn into love.

144
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,010
That, my friend, is what it means to be a dad.

145
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,060
Yes, that's very touching.

146
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,840
But maybe you should do something

147
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,170
that Adam likes for a change.

148
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,370
But he likes space ships and dragons and video games.

149
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,220
Did you know that the Mario brothers

150
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,410
aren't even real?

151
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,480
For three years, I thought they were the boys

152
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,420
who lived across the street.

153
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,490
Just give it a shot.

154
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,870
I think you'll see that kid is into some pretty cool stuff.

155
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,990
Hey, dad, check it out.

156
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,840
Doesn't it look like I'm in zero gravity?

157
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,480
Yeah. So, this is what you do, huh?

158
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,850
Making a sci-fi movie.

159
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,680
Yeah, space stuff.

160
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,650
You ever do any westerns or gritty cop dramas?

161
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,330
No, not my genres.

162
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,180
Although, technically, Star Wars was a western,

163
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,080
and Robocop was incredibly dark.

164
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,920
So just space stuff.

165
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,070
- Well, you need a hand? - Really?

166
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Yeah, sure. I'll, um, hold the camera or something.

167
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,870
Do you want to act in it?

168
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,110
Do I?

169
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,640
Awesome!

170
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,260
Lie down on the bed, and whatever happens, don't move.

171
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,930
Lie down and don't move.

172
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,560
What do you know, I've been an actor my whole life.

173
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,140
Okay.

174
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,010
In a nutshell, you're Caine, a space miner

175
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,370
who has an alien egg gestating in your belly.

176
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,490
I'm who with the what?

177
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,860
Get ready to freak out.

178
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,410
Why would I freak out?

179
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,850
What are you doing?

180
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,040
Why would you do that?

181
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:30,970
Stop!

182
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,480
What is that?! Get it out!

183
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,470
- Stop! - Stop talking. You're dead.

184
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,800
You ruined my one good shirt! You're dead!

185
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,760
Dad, I told you there was an alien egg in your stomach.

186
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,950
What do you think that means?

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,570
You know what? Let's go back to hockey.

188
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,860
That, I understand.

189
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,600
While my dad's attempt at bonding was an utter failure,

190
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,900
my mom was pushing Erica to the next level.

191
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,710
How did I do already?

192
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Okay, just know that this is a practice test

193
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,300
and we still have a lot of work to do.

194
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,310
Son of a bitch. That bad?

195
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,310
- 1,280. - What?

196
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,450
You better come over here and hug your mama

197
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,020
before I punch you in the face.

198
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,430
Oh, my god!

199
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,920
I thought you were just talking like a crazy person

200
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,830
like you do every other second of the day.

201
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,070
But you actually helped me boost my score by like 100 points!

202
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,310
You're damn right I did.

203
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,070
And that's good enough to get you into Penn.

204
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,250
Forget Penn. That's good enough for Stanford.

205
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,610
- Wait, what? - Yeah, I need a 1,300 to get in.

206
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,410
Only 20 more points to go.

207
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,450
Stanford is in California.

208
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,840
I know. It's so far away.

209
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,480
You are not going to school 20,000 miles away from me --

210
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,750
Us. The family.

211
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,220
You seriously won't let me go

212
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,150
to one of the best colleges in the country?

213
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,020
I...

214
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,540
What the hell was that?

215
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,550
I...

216
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
- Stop. - I...

217
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,930
Stop doing that.

218
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,880
What are you doing?

219
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,550
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

220
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,270
I-I-it -- Stanford's just so far away.

221
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,790
I...I wouldn't be able to just pop in on the weekends,

222
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,500
and -- and hang out with you and your girlfriends

223
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,650
and try on clothes and then have you take me

224
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,120
to the local college pubs, where you introduce me

225
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,930
as your older sister Barbie to the cute T.A.S.

226
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,290
- That's your plan? - One of them, yeah.

227
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,450
Well, thank god I learned how to kick ass on this test.

228
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,980
Thank god.

229
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,700
What have I done?

230
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,630
Well look who it is.

231
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,600
Try not to score on your own goal, lame Gretzky.

232
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,270
Mayb instead of being a total putz,

233
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,300
you could actually help me?

234
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,170
You want my help? Quit.

235
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,620
Quitting isn't an option.

236
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,830
You know how much it matters to dad.

237
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,290
I don't want to let him down.

238
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,030
If I cared at all, that would make me sad.

239
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,000
Maybe you could teach me something,

240
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,550
so then, when I look in the stands,

241
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,250
dad's not hiding his face in shame.

242
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,510
What I got can't be taught. It's called natural talent.

243
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,680
See, I'm the type of player

244
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,540
who controls the flow of the game.

245
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,320
You, on the other hand, are a turd on ice.

246
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,930
I know! But there's got to be something I can do.

247
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,420
I guess you could always be a goon.

248
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,720
A goon? Like in "Goonies"?

249
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,790
A goon -- an enforcer.

250
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,110
They protect the awesome players like me

251
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,170
using violence and dirty play.

252
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,800
As long as they can kick butt,

253
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,160
a goon doesn't need to shoot or score.

254
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,360
Teach me. I am yours to mold.

255
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,440
Please. Teach me how to be a goonie.

256
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,370
Goon!

257
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,620
Can we just say goonie if it helps me get there?

258
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,350
That meant yes, Barry would help me.

259
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,490
All I had to do now was learn how to fight.

260
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,750
Realizing a good test score meant losing her daughter,

261
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,020
my mom changed her tutoring tactics.

262
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,890
Hey, study buddy.

263
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,510
What's all this?

264
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,610
I just wanted some coffee so I could stay up and study.

265
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,430
Well, you're in luck,

266
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,940
because nothing keeps your energy up

267
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,190
like warm milk and a big pile of turkey.

268
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,520
Don't those things put you to sleep?

269
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,620
No, no. The opposite is true.

270
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,600
I read that in a magazine I threw away.

271
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,900
Well, you got me this far. I trust you.

272
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,390
Oh, you're sweet.

273
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,650
Oh, listen, I was thinking,

274
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,960
as a reward for all your hard work,

275
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,070
you might want to let off some steam

276
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,200
and go to see Rick Springfield on Friday night.

277
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,450
But that's the night before the test.

278
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,470
Okay.

279
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,230
Your loss, egghead.

280
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,020
Well, I should probably get back to work.

281
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,630
Oh, about that, um, I made up

282
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,270
some new vocab cards for you to memorize.

283
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,920
This should get you the extra points

284
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,410
you need to get into Stanford.

285
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,190
Oh, thanks, mom.

286
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,420
"Scubulence, noun --

287
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,130
The process of removing scuba equipment from a boat."

288
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,280
Weird word.

289
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:31,080
Yeah, weird and real. Just like "Flimjam, verb --

290
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,590
To run backwards in a zig-zag pattern."

291
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,400
Got it.

292
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,260
Well, that makes me feel very "Torkulent, adjective --

293
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,240
Delighted and a little scared."

294
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,800
Well, let me just flimjam out of here

295
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,280
and, uh, good luck with your studying.

296
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,890
"Fidangle, verb -- to finish dangling."

297
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,920
What the hell?

298
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,670
She wouldn't.

299
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,280
She would.

300
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,340
While my mom was trying to hurt Erica's chances on the S.A.T.,

301
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,940
Barry was teaching me how to hurt people on the ice.

302
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,200
Okay, Ad rock, listen up.

303
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,100
There are a few crucial things you need to learn

304
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,530
in order to be an enforcer.

305
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,940
I'm ready for this. Teach me.

306
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,450
We'll start with the basics.

307
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,110
Lesson one -- this is your stick.

308
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,340
People like me use it to score.

309
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,330
People like you use it as a weapon.

310
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,480
Cool. Like a sword.

311
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,950
I can use the moves I learned in my stage-combat class.

312
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,020
Lesson two -- every time you say something like that,

313
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,230
you get a nerd punch in the meaty part of your arm.

314
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,180
Smart. The pain will motivate me.

315
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,310
Nerd punch!

316
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,280
Lesson three -- your stick is to never touch the ice.

317
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,650
It's used for slashing, hooking, butt-ending, and spearing.

318
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,800
- Any questions? - Aren't all those penalties?

319
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,880
Nerd punch!

320
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,100
Lesson four -- fighting.

321
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,150
But I didn't learn lessons one through three yet.

322
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,060
Maybe you did, maybe you didn't.

323
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,380
- I didn't. - Or did you?

324
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,850
- I didn't! - Nerd punch!

325
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,720
Now, the trick to a hockey fight is the first person

326
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,750
who sheds their gloves strikes first.

327
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,520
Go! Again!

328
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,560
Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry.

329
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,610
Again!

330
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,850
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!

331
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,990
You're gonna lose to a kid with looser gloves.

332
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,170
- Again! - I think I got it now.

333
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,960
You got it when I say you got it.

334
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,530
Which is now.

335
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,280
Lesson five, and the most important lesson of them all --

336
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,360
When you're in a fight,

337
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,620
you grab the bottom of your opponent's jersey

338
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,040
and yank it over his head, like so.

339
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,200
Stop it! I can't see!

340
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,780
Good. You're learning.

341
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,160
Lesson six -- watch out for elbows.

342
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
There's my little genius.

343
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,750
You all geared up for the big test tomorrow?

344
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,500
All thanks to your help.

345
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,070
You know, I thought a lot about what you said,

346
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,850
and I decided that Penn is a great choice for me.

347
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,570
Oh, it's happening.

348
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,390
- We're going to Penn! - I know!

349
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,750
I'm so excited that I decided to get a head start

350
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,660
on my essay for their application.

351
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,760
Here it is.

352
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,870
"I believe that the university of Pennsylvania

353
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,660
is the right school for me.

354
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,150
Because of its torkulent history and diligord reputation."

355
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,940
- Oh, boy. - Don't stop. Keep going.

356
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,620
Ah, I'd rather not.

357
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,200
Okay, pops, would you mind?

358
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,370
"I feel that I could really benefit

359
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,290
from being part of its cromtormulous student body

360
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,490
and weepeggle faculty."

361
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,590
Weepeggle? What the...

362
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,490
Keep reading.

363
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,430
"I would be bumgubbled to quarp a university

364
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,720
that is so vernaciously proggle

365
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,970
that even the most zeticent student could gobulate."

366
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,330
Gobulate?

367
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,440
Honest question -- when you wrote this,

368
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,170
were you smoking a jazz cigarette?

369
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,170
Oh, it's much worse than that.

370
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,390
I have a mother that taught me fake vocab words

371
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,710
to screw me out of the college I want to go to.

372
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,960
What? That's crazy.

373
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,430
That is crazy, right?

374
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,460
I can explain.

375
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,560
Oh, no.

376
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,480
What kind of mother sabotages her daughter?

377
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,710
Who does that?

378
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,420
Just go to Penn.

379
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,900
It's only 20 minutes away.

380
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,850
I can cook for you and do your laundry

381
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,050
and clean your room because it's only 20 minutes away,

382
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,920
so you should live here and commute.

383
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,360
Oh, well, I've got news for you.

384
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,400
California ain't far enough away.

385
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,260
I'm going to Japan university.

386
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,610
That's right. Good luck popping in on me there.

387
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,190
Do you really think that'll stop me?

388
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,960
I'll fly halfway around the planet

389
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,030
just to see you every weekend if I have to.

390
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,040
Fine! Then I'll just colonize the moon

391
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,140
and go to college there!

392
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,590
Then I'll get on a rocket every weekend

393
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,970
just so I can give you a hug.

394
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,160
- You can't do that! - Oh, I can.

395
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,860
And I will bring you tang and I'll iron your space suit

396
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,120
and I'll take your alien roommates to Bennigans!

397
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,150
I hate that you love me so much!

398
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,450
While my mom and Erica had taken the gloves off,

399
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,670
I was about to do the same.

400
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,510
Nooo!

401
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,980
This wasn't the plan!

402
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,380
Fight back, Adam!

403
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,400
Use your stick, just like I taught you!

404
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,710
You taught him what?

405
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,970
Nothing. I taught him nothing.

406
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,300
No, no, stop! I'm the enforcer.

407
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,190
You can't enforce the enforcer.

408
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,390
Ball up!

409
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,850
Curl into a ball!

410
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,740
Dear god, no!

411
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,300
Adam! Get back here. We need to talk.

412
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,600
No. Just leave me alone.

413
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,390
This is your fault, you moron.

414
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,930
I'm a moron?

415
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,010
Adam's the one who got suspended for fighting.

416
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,550
Yeah, you're the one who taught him how to fight!

417
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,890
I was trying to help him.

418
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,600
All he wanted to do was impress you.

419
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,540
How's it supposed to impress me

420
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,420
to have him dragged by the face

421
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,290
and turned into a human hockey puck?

422
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,030
I don't know.

423
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,760
You won't let him quit,

424
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,210
so what else is he supposed to do?

425
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,300
Do you know why I won't let him quit?

426
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,240
You and I have a ton in common.

427
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,590
We talk about sports, food, cars.

428
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,960
But Adam -- this is all we've got,

429
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,200
and if you take hockey away, there's a good chance

430
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,650
that Adam and I might never speak again.

431
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,170
I see what you're saying.

432
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,120
I'm your favorite son.

433
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,460
- Didn't say that. - I get it.

434
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,870
- No, you don't. - You love me more.

435
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,840
- You're an idiot. - You can say it all you want.

436
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,000
- You're an idiot. - But we all know how you really feel.

437
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,380
- You're an idiot. - I get it.

438
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,980
- Just stop. - Okay.

439
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,690
Listen, I know Adam's hobbies are weird to us.

440
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,160
No. Weird to everyone.

441
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,500
But the kid tried for five years to do your thing.

442
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,600
Maybe now it's time to try his thing

443
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,840
for more than five minutes.

444
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,070
That's pretty smart, Barry.

445
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,470
Of course! I'm your favorite.

446
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,980
And back to stupid.

447
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,500
Poopie, can mama come in?

448
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,770
Let me guess.

449
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,370
You're here with "Directions"

450
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,250
to the new test center that doesn't exist?

451
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,220
I'm here to apologize.

452
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,990
What I did was wrong.

453
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,050
You know, you always say you want what's best for your children,

454
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,940
but, really, you just want what's best for you.

455
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,840
Okay, I was selfish.

456
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,740
But...I just love you so much.

457
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,350
I never want to let you go.

458
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,440
And you think that that's

459
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,520
supposed to make what you did any better?

460
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,000
Look...I know you're gonna go off to college one day,

461
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,120
but the reality of you moving all the way across the country

462
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,620
and starting a whole new life, that freaked me out.

463
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,060
But I know this isn't about me,

464
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,400
so if Stanford is what you want, then, damn it,

465
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,330
we are gonna get you into Stanford.

466
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,640
- Do you mean that? - I don't.

467
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,980
- Understood. - But I'll work on it.

468
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,340
And maybe in a year or so... I will.

469
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,180
You know, um... I never finished college,

470
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,750
so I could always apply.

471
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,640
Don't ruin the hug.

472
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,590
Okay.

473
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,330
Hey. How you doing?

474
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,210
Well, I discovered the only thing worse

475
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,760
than scoring on your own goal

476
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,830
is getting scored into your own goal.

477
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,790
Look, I know you're not enjoying hockey,

478
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,030
and I'm not enjoying you not enjoying hockey,

479
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,310
so I thought, "There has to be

480
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,830
something else we can do together."

481
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,150
Please don't make me play football.

482
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,930
No, no, no. No sports. Done with sports.

483
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,360
So, I went to the store, and I got you

484
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,420
a family-size bottle of ketchup

485
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,400
and a three pack of t-shirts for you to ruin,

486
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,980
In case you want to give that alien movie thing another try.

487
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,910
- You mean it? - Yeah. Why not?

488
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,860
Well, if we do this, we do it right.

490
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,790
Oh! Oh, my god!

491
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,420
Call the robot president!

492
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,860
My dad learned that, while I was nothing like him,

493
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,050
he could meet me halfway, and even though

494
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,870
I didn't play hockey anymore, he still had Barry...

495
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,240
Goal!

496
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,920
Oh, yeah! All, man!

497
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,720
...which was a mixed bag.

498
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,430
Put it in, scorekeeper. Put it in.

499
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,300
As for Erica, she was feeling quite torkulent

500
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,220
as she sat down to take the S.A.T.

501
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,120
Nothing would stop her, not even fireworks.

502
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,550
And begin.

503
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,030
Mail just came.

505
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,130
Oh, my god!

506
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,480
I knew you could do it.

507
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,910
I may actually go to California.

508
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,130
I'll follow you to the moon, baby.

509
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,000
In the end, my parents realized all they could do

510
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,890
was let us be who we wanted to be and just enjoy the ride.

511
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,880
And we're rolling. "Alien dad -- the sequel."

512
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,490
Okay, here's the backstory.

513
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,350
You're a space miner about to explore

514
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,010
an alien vessel all by yourself.

515
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,340
By myself? An alien vessel? No, no, no, no.

516
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,530
- Let's just send in a dog or something. - A dog?

517
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,910
We'll give it a flashlight. Strap a camera on its back.

518
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,500
You're on a solo mission. There is no dog.

519
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,460
Only a moron would go on a ship by himself.

520
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,960
Well, you're going in there, so I guess you're a moron.

521
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,360
How are things going in here?

522
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,400
He's refusing to go on the alien ship.

523
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,300
Murray, just go in the damn ship.

524
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,380
Fine! I will go in the damn ship.

525
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,760
Good, 'cause now an alien attacks your face

526
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,610
and implants an egg inside your belly.

527
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,810
Well, that's exactly the reason I didn't want to go in.
