11
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,910
Back in the '80s,

12
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,910
before pilates and macrobiotic diets,

13
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,980
old people were old, except for one--

14
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,620
My grandfather.

15
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,700
He was a man who loved risk and took chances. 

16
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,460
- Get there! Get there! - Yes! Come on, come on, come on!

17
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,870
He was a connoisseur of fine spirits.

18
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,390
Oh! Muy bueno.

19
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,520
In a word, my grandfather was awesome.

20
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,830
That's game, kiddo. Better luck next time.

21
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,770
Come on, pops. Let me win at least one.

22
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,620
That's a terrible lesson.

23
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,180
I'm gonna beat your ass again real quick.

24
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,340
And in wintertime,

25
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,120
when his friends retreated to Florida,

26
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,280
that's when we always saw a lot more of him.

27
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,070
Bev, look at this!

28
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,700
Billy Joel's coming to town. You gotta see this!

29
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,240
Not now, dad. I've got three lunches to make.

30
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,190
Look at this picture of him.

31
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,860
- He's wearing the exact same sunglasses as I am. - Yeah.

32
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,860
Oh, yeah.

33
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,450
I'm gonna call for tickets.

34
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,980
Bevy! Where's my other black sock?

35
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,090
In your sock drawer.

36
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,690
That drawer is a wasteland of unmatched pairs.

37
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,540
It's chaos!

38
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,680
Then wear a different pair.

39
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,060
I've already got my black one on!

40
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,030
Ugh! This is a nightmare!

41
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,440
Ow! Ow! My tooth! My tooth!

42
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,390
How do you hurt yourself eating cereal?

43
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,790
I bit the free toy!

44
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,730
If it doesn't look like cereal, don't chew on it.

45
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,930
Dad, you're in the way!

46
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,180
I-I'm just calling the ticket broker.

47
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,480
You and me are gonna sit front and center.

48
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,300
Dad, can you please go in the den?

49
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,250
Everywhere I step, there you are.

50
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,680
You're underfoot.

51
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,930
- And Billy Joel can wait. - Bye.

52
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,170
Don't say "bye."

53
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,310
Your S.A.T. Prep course is at 4:00,

54
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,100
so get your ass home after school.

55
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,570
I don't know what you're saying.

56
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,330
Well, take off your walkboy.

57
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,830
It's called a walkman.

58
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560
Oh, now you can hear me?

59
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,100
I wish I couldn't.

60
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,380
The tickets are all sold out.

61
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,490
Let's roam around the bad neighborhoods

62
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,340
until we find a scalper.

63
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,620
Dad, I've got 17 loads of laundry to do.

64
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,630
I'm gonna go put on my shoes, and I'll wait in the car.

65
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,590
All right, Bevy, today I went with the blue socks,

66
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,510
- but we're just kicking the can down the road. - Can you do me a favor?

67
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,910
Take my dad to work with you today.

68
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,040
He's been retired ten years. Why would he want to do that?

69
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,970
I don't care what he wants. I want him out of here.

70
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,460
Go ask him.

71
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,230
Hey, Albert.

72
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,410
How would you like to come to the store with me today?

73
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,460
Nah.

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,610
Well, I tried. He's your problem now.

75
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,530
My parents were together so long,

76
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,030
they could have an entire fight all about you, inches away,

77
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,780
without ever making a sound.

78
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,430
Hey, Albert, Vic and the guys

79
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,340
were just talking with me the other day, and, uh,

80
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,450
they were saying how much they'd love you to stop by.

81
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,250
We all would.

82
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,150
For god sake, Murray, can't you take a hint?

83
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,590
- I don't wanna go. - I understand.

84
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,240
And sometimes it only took a look.

85
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,180
- But I insist. - Fine.

86
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,720
It was January 11th, 1980-something,

87
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,490
and pops was headed back to his old stomping grounds.

88
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,500
Hey, Vic.

89
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,370
Look at this hobo I found out wandering the street.

90
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,900
Ohh. You kidding me?

91
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,790
Do my eyes deceive me?

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,590
Ohh! Okay.

93
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,550
I'm easy. Try picking up that one.

94
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,400
Hell, no.

95
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,090
Yeah, go ahead. Bust my balls.

96
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,160
That's what we do.

97
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,890
My god, look at this place.

98
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,020
I-I barely recognize it.

99
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,820
Yeah, I made some upgrades,

100
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,090
expanded the showroom,

101
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,140
put in track lighting.

102
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,110
What the hell's that? 

103
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,850
We do all our inventory on computers now.

104
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,710
What is this, the "Star Wars"?

105
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,580
What about Sheila the redhead,

106
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,390
who comes in Saturdays to do the books?

107
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,900
- Oh, I got rid of her. - What?

108
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,880
Yeah, she'd been stealing from us for years.

109
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,160
That's the price you pay for great gams.

110
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,100
Now all you have to look at is Vic.

111
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,680
Oh, you've never seen my gams.

112
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,920
Oh, yeah, softball.

113
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,070
What's next, you give Vic's job to a robot?

114
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,830
I gotta see my office.

115
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
Hey, come here a second.

116
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,920
Listen, um... I want you to spend the day with him.

117
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,910
He's got a lot of energy, and he tends to get underfoot.

118
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,020
Hey, you've got new glass shelves, too!

119
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,170
While pops was tiring out my dad,

120
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,590
I was trying to keep up with my long-time crush,

121
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,910
Dana Caldwell.

122
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,320
You let me win!

123
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,370
Yeah. That's what I did. Oh, boy.

124
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,580
I should get going.

125
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,120
I've gotta read "To kill a mockingbird" for English.

126
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,490
You know, I got the cliffsnotes in my room.

127
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,480
You wanna borrow 'em?

128
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,370
Okay.

129
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,110
Yep, it was happening.

130
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,850
I had a girl in my bedroom for the very first time.

131
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,880
- Here you go. - Thank you.

132
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,110
So... This is your room, huh?

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,730
This was it. The moment every man waits for.

134
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,300
Time to show her what goes down

135
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,340
in Adam Goldberg's private quarters.

136
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,230
This is where the magic happens.

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,240
Voila.

138
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,540
Oh, what's that behind your ear?

139
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,770
Soft red ball.

140
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,320
Just a little taste.

141
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,570
Do you like transformers?

142
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,240
What... Are they again?

143
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,040
Hello. They're robots in disguise.

144
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,210
It's an exciting time in the franchise.

145
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,070
They're branching out from vehicles

146
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,790
to dinosaurs and insects.

147
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,280
- That... Is exciting. - Do you like He-man?

148
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,430
I guess.

149
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,350
Castle greyskull.

150
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,350
Skeletor lives there. Whatever.

151
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,660
Do you like G.I. Joe?

152
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,860
Don't answer yet.

153
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,400
Right this way.

154
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,060
Behold, the "U.S.S. Flagg."

155
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,550
That takes up a lot of room.

156
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,880
Well, yeah. It's an aircraft carrier.

157
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,740
It's meant to hold aircraft.

158
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,010
It's all right there in the name.

159
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,690
Yep, this was going perfectly.

160
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,920
But what happened next would really rock my world.

161
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,190
I... Gotta go.

162
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,340
Thank you for your time!

163
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,950
...I said for no reason at all!

164
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,630
As baffled as I was, my dad was even more confused

165
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,790
- when he got back from his lunch break. - Little bit higher, Vic.

166
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,990
Almost got it.

167
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell is going on here?

168
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,720
Going out of business?!

170
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,790
Damn it. I was gonna surprise you.

171
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,070
We don't go for these gimmicks anymore.

172
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,250
It's a proven sales technique.

173
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,680
I'm just juicing things up a bit.

175
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,420
It's not a furniture store now.

176
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,900
It's a hip lounge.

177
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,360
Number one-- it is a furniture store.

178
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,560
Number two--the two biggest enemies of furniture

179
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,470
are smoke and coffee.

180
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,760
And jheri curl juice.

181
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,000
Three enemies!

182
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,320
Who wants jazz?

183
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,490
Okay. What the hell is going on here?

184
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,140
You were supposed to play gin rummy with him

185
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,220
in the backroom all day.

186
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,190
Nah, he wouldn't stay put.

187
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,480
That old man's got so much energy and charisma.

188
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,010
Now you can learn a thing or two from him. 

189
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,260
Ah, charisma.

190
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,840
I don't know what happened. It was going so great.

191
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,450
And then she just ran off for no reason.

192
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,680
Why would she do that?

193
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,170
'Cause no girl on this planet

194
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,210
would ever wanna make out in this room.

195
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,730
Seriously, it looks like a nerd bomb went off in here.

196
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,050
I hate to admit it, but the idiot's right.

197
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,210
It was the toys.

198
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,540
So my toys freaked her out?

199
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,960
The fact that you have toys freaked her out.

200
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,670
Listen, chicks like waterbeds

201
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,360
and samurai swords that elegantly

202
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,100
hang over a fireplace.

203
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,870
It's a scientific fact.

204
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,060
He's still an idiot.

205
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,740
But he's right. If you want Dana to like you,

206
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,810
lose the toys.

207
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,710
I can't. They're like family.

208
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,070
What would you rather touch-- a boob or a Dino-bot?

209
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
You took too long! The answer is clearly "boob."

210
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,500
You're in seventh grade, bud.

211
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,980
It's time to grow up.

212
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,970
She's right. From now on, 

213
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,400
you gotta stop playing with toys

214
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,150
and start acting like a man.

215
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,190
First step--

216
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,450
Drakkar noir.

217
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,400
No woman can resist its alluring stink.

218
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,890
Now you never apply it directly onto your own skin.

219
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,790
You simply mist...

220
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,590
And walk through.

221
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,190
While my lesson on how to be a man had just begun,

222
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,330
my dad was happy 

223
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,510
his day with pops had come to an end.

224
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,700
There you are.

225
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,560
How'd it go with my dad? Did you have a good time?

226
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,020
Give me a minute. Can't a man take off his pants?

227
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,030
Have you been smoking?

228
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,550
A cigar?

229
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,510
Two! With some low-end cognac.

230
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,530
Your dad turned my discount furniture store

231
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,920
into the copacabana.

232
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,960
Ohh. I'm nauseous.

233
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,450
Well, thank you for doing that.

234
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,190
You owe me. I'd like, uh, some shrimp parm...

235
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,440
With extra shrimp and extra parm.

236
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,780
- I thought you said you were nauseous. - I'll fight through it.

237
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,820
- Okay, you got it. - I'm not moving.

238
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,830
I'm gonna eat right here.

239
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,390
All right, don't be such a baby.

240
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,110
It was only for one day.

241
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,000
Or so she thought.

242
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,980
That one day turned into two.

243
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,100
...Kroehler sofas for half that price.

244
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,250
Well, it's fine. I got some good leads in the rolodex.

245
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,870
Al, what are you doing?

246
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,340
Uh, what do you know?

247
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,640
You found some at that price.

248
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,150
Yeah, I'll take 'em all.

250
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,840
And those two days would turn into the longest week

251
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,370
of my father's life.

252
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,240
Now that I was a man, it was time to break

253
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,320
some tough news to some old friends.

254
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,420
Sorry, lion-o. Sorry, cheetara.

255
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,880
It's time to grow up.

256
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,900
Thundercats ho!

257
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,250
And after five trips,

258
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,570
I had successfully packed up all my toys.

259
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,860
Mom, I'm going out.

260
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,380
Wear your jacket and your muffs.

261
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm a grown man!

262
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,480
And I was on a mission--

263
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,900
A mission to prove that the geeky little kid in me

264
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,600
was gone forever.

265
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,820
Literally, nothing could stop me.

266
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,260
It's actually kind of cold out.

267
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,220
- Oh, your nose is all pink like a little kitten. - Mom.

268
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,740
Stop.

269
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,340
Stop it.

270
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,270
Oh. Hey.

271
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,820
Howdy.

272
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,020
So... The other day when you were over at my house,

273
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,350
you ran off so fast,

274
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,600
that I didn't get a chance to tell you something.

275
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,410
The reason why I showed you my toys was

276
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,000
'Cause I've outgrown 'em, and I thought maybe

277
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,720
your little brother might like 'em.

278
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,570
You really wanna give all your toys away?

279
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,610
Yeah, I've been meaning to do it for years,

280
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,540
plus I... I need to clear some shelf space

281
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,600
for my cologne, beer can collection,

282
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,260
- and jock straps. - Well, that's so nice of you.

283
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,080
Dougie, Adam Goldberg brought a whole bunch of toys for you.

284
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,660
Cool!

285
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,920
Awesome!

286
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,920
Had it. Have it.

287
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,150
Sell it.

288
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,380
Have it.

289
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,400
Wanna come in?

290
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:45,970
Sure.

291
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,710
Okay.

292
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,310
Now listen, and listen good, you little putz.

293
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,290
That's sergeant slaughter of the renegade squadron,

294
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,950
and you're gonna treat him and all my toys

295
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,150
with the respect that they deserve,

296
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,350
or so help me, I--

297
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,050
Adam? You coming?

298
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,270
Hey, you bet.

299
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,470
I'd given up my toys,

300
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,900
but pops wasn't giving up on his big plans for the store.

301
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,500
You busy?

302
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,870
Does it matter?

303
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,740
Well, I just discovered that the key to our success

304
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,600
has been here all the time.

305
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,010
Back in the old days, before I hired you,

306
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,150
I had an ad running on the local TV.

307
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,770
Business boomed.

308
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,480
Okay, before you say anything else,

309
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,680
just know that making a commercial

310
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,710
is way too expensive for us.

311
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,670
Way ahead of you, Mur.

312
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,820
That's why we use this.

313
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,990
Hey there, ladies.

314
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,650
Put down those vacuum cleaners for a second.

315
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,940
Big Al's got something to say.

316
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,810
When your man comes home at night,

317
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,070
don't you want him to see furniture

318
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,110
that looks just as gorgeous as you do?

319
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,510
Thanks, Sheila.

320
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,090
Down at the Ottoman Empire,

321
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,450
we got sofas starting at $35.99.

322
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,590
Can you buy on credit? You bet!

323
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,750
With your husband's signature, of course.

324
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,890
So come on down and let big Al service you.

325
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,760
Ottoman Empire--

326
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,250
Old york road and route 73...

327
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,480
I think it holds up pretty well.

328
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,870
I think it's amazing that there was a time

329
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,330
when that was okay.

330
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,490
We're not running this commercial.

331
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,050
Albert, you worked so hard

332
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,830
making Ottoman Empire what it is today,

333
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,480
but don't you think now is the time

334
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,160
to do things like play golf or take a steam

335
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,900
or feed the pigeons?

336
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,340
Pigeons. That does sound fun.

337
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,870
We agree? No commercial?

338
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,850
No commercial. I totally get it.

339
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,230
But he didn't get it.

340
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,530
Quiet on the set!

341
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,310
Damn it, Albert.

342
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,380
What did I say?!

343
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,960
You're gonna love this commercial, Mur.

344
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,030
I'm insane Albert.

345
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,290
I price my furniture so low, I require hospitalization.

346
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,760
He's crazy Al.

347
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,430
Yeah, I get it. No commercial!

348
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,730
Send everybody home.

349
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,880
Oh, I can't do that.

350
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,480
I already hired the crew, bought this straitjacket.

351
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,880
It is cheaper than renting it.

352
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,710
Vic, go away... Far away.

353
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,790
Vic, you stay.

354
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,170
He's the orderly that wheels me back into the loony bin

355
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,800
'Cause my prices are bananas.

356
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,220
Come here, Albert.

357
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,300
Look, I've tried being nice to you all week.

358
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,820
I can't do it anymore.

359
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,830
You gotta take off the straitjacket

360
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,010
and go home. Please!

361
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,610
I didn't wanna play this card,

362
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,520
but I do own 51% of the business,

363
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,370
so the decision is mine.

364
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,140
What are you saying?

365
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,700
This commercial is happening

366
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,180
whether you like it or not.

367
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,530
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go back

368
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,180
and get into my mentally unstable character.

369
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,390
You got that covered.

370
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,430
Honey, what happened to all your toys?

371
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,520
Gave 'em away. It's cool.

372
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,010
Can you float me roughly $2,000?

373
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,200
May I ask for what?

374
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,190
A waterbed and a decorative samurai sword to hang above it.

375
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,400
A samurai sword will fall off the wall

376
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,600
in the middle of the night, poke your eye out,

377
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,760
puncture the mattress,

378
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,610
and then you'll drown in your sleep.

379
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,430
Is that a "no"?

380
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,850
Yes, that's a "no."

381
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,630
Honey, you can't give your toys away.

382
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,790
You love 'em so much.

383
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,760
Toys are kids' stuff.

384
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,300
I'm a man now.

385
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,710
As of yesterday.

386
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,060
A very happy, happy man.

387
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,870
That's Barry's smell. Why do you smell like Barry?

388
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,660
It's drakkar noir. He gave it to me.

389
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,490
I love to spend money on a girl...

390
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

391
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:56,980
What the hell?

392
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,090
What did you two idiots do?

393
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,790
That could mean so many things.

394
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,890
Why did my scrumptious little baby

395
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,640
give away all his toys?

396
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,610
We just told him the truth, mom.

397
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,060
Yeah. He'll never get any action with his room full of toys.

398
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,020
He doesn't need any action. He's a little boy.

399
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,910
I'm going over there right now and getting his toys back.

400
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,040
If you do, you're gonna cost him his first girlfriend.

401
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,200
He doesn't need a girlfriend. He's got me.

402
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,690
Yuck.

403
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,600
I didn't mean girlfriend. I meant... Main lady.

404
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,580
That is so much worse.

405
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,580
I meant...

406
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,470
Woman in his life that he loves more than anyone else.

407
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,430
Mom, you're in free fall. Pull the rip cord.

408
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,710
I'm going over there to get those toys back.

409
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,520
You two are grounded for a year.

410
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,930
You hear me? A year.

411
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,480
Glad you messed with me? You should know better.

412
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,810
Hey there.

413
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,330
What great old toys.

414
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,090
I'm from a local charity,

415
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,200
and I was wondering if you'd take 20 whole dollars for them.

416
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,330
You're Adam Goldberg's mother.

417
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,220
Okay, I didn't know you knew that.

418
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,700
Listen...

419
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,620
My son Adam is

420
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,000
at a transitional age right now.

421
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,330
He's starting to mature and to have feelings

422
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,750
he's... Never felt before, and--

423
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,000
I want a turtle.

424
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,400
That's nice. Why don't you go in and get your mom?

425
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,070
Go on. Get mama.

426
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,070
Hi.

427
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,660
You must be Dana's mom. 

428
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,130
I'm Beverly Goldberg.

429
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,190
Well, I'll have you over for brunch, okay?

430
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,250
Bye-bye. This was fun.

432
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,500
After pops took off his straitjacket,

433
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,650
he finally regained his sanity.

434
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,070
Hey, can we talk?

435
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,410
It's up to you. You're the boss.

436
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,610
I can give you, uh, 51% of the couch.

437
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,000
Stop it, will ya? I-I came to apologize.

438
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,880
Look...

439
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,870
It's tough always feeling like you're underfoot.

440
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,760
I was doing okay with it,

441
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,340
but then when I walked back in here, uh...

442
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,990
I felt like I mattered again.

443
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,990
Stop it. You matter.

444
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,550
This is your store, Murray.

445
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,390
You've done a hell of a job with it

446
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,210
for ten years-- better than I could've done.

447
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,830
Which is why I've decided...

448
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,290
To give you this.

449
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,010
That's my 2%.

450
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,070
You should be the majority owner.

451
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,090
This is your store now.

452
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,690
Thank you, Albert. It means a lot.

453
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,910
I'm gonna miss this place.

454
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,090
Oh, you...

455
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,690
You could always come by, like, once a week

456
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,340
to check on things.

457
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,110
I can put another desk next to mine in the office.

458
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,900
Nah. I couldn't do that.

459
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,760
You could.

460
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,010
Walnut. Danish modern with a teak inlay.

461
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,270
Don't cheap out.

462
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,350
Now come here and give me a hug.

463
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,060
Uh, I'm not a big hugger.

464
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,520
Get over here, you bastard.

465
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,700
Hi.

466
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,420
Hello. What you got there, toys of some sort?

467
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,570
I brought 'em back

468
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,390
'Cause I know you didn't really wanna give them away.

469
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,960
What? No, that's not true.

470
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,030
- Your mom came over. - That damn woman.

471
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,020
That's okay.

472
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,830
My... Mom would have done the same thing

473
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,080
if I gave away all my care bears.

474
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,070
Wait. It wasn't the toys?

475
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,100
Then why did you run out of my room the other day?

476
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,370
I... Ran out 'cause...

477
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,430
I thought we were gonna kiss.

478
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,650
Not that I didn't wanna kiss.

479
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,070
I just... Got nervous.

480
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,770
So...

481
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,650
Thank you for bringing my stuff.

482
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,090
See you at school.

483
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,690
Thank you!

484
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,310
Stupid. I was supposed to kiss her.

485
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,570
Stupid, stupid!

486
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,150
Yeah, you blew it.

487
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,120
But we'll work on it.

488
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,190
Never thought I'd say it,

489
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,730
but this computer is way better than Sheila's gams.

490
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,680
Hey, Mur. We got a tough customer.

491
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,060
You wanna work your magic?

492
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,990
You coming?

493
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,100
You bet your ass.

494
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,680
Yeah, getting older is confusing and complicated,

495
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,580
but no matter how hard we tried,

496
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,150
pops couldn't slow it down, and that day,

497
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,930
I decided not to rush it either.

498
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,650
I am megatron, leader of the decepticons.

499
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,020
I am optimus prime, and I am a good guy,

500
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,700
and I will kick your butt!

501
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,980
Who's there?

502
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,880
Get dressed now!

503
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,190
Oh, no! The bad guys are coming for us! 

505
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,270
My name is megatron. I am good.

506
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,130
Who's there?

507
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,450
Get dressed now.

508
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,260
Oh.

509
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,380
I am good and... This is it.

510
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,500
Aah! That hurt! Aah!

511
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,770
Hey! I'm Murray the maniac.

512
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,190
And I'm committed to insane prices!

513
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,050
Hello! I'm Murray the maniac,

514
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,600
and I'm committed to insane prices!

515
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,290
You think that was too much, the way I went, "insane"?

516
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,490
And... Action.

517
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,760
Well, I came out while you were saying "action."

518
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,120
- Does that matter? - Okay, all right, all right. Cut.

519
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:03,210
I'm Murray the mania--why couldn't we get a good one?!

520
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,230
Hi. I'm insane. 

521
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,190
- No, it's "insane prices." - No. "hello."

522
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,520
It's "hello."

523
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,130
Just help me up. Help me up.

524
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,900
Help me up. Just push from behind.

525
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,440
- I like what you were doing, man. - Thank you.

526
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,090
Hey! I'm Murray the maniac, and I'm bananas!

527
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,960
I am just b-a-n...

528
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,060
A
"A."

529
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,380
-A  -N
- "A." - "n."

530
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,360
Is it two n's?

531
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,790
Did we close the whole day for this ?
