1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,680
我回家了
I'm home!

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,990
我爸是地球上最简单的人
My dad was the least complicated guy on the planet.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,670
他的首要追求永远是舒适
His first order of business was to always be comfortable.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,370
这意味着在门口脱掉长裤
That meant parking his pants at the door.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,470
他的嗜好包括在沙发上睡着
His hobbies included sleeping in his chair...

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,510
看《神秘岛》
...Watching "Fantasy island"...

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,610
别担心  老板
Oh, don't worry, boss.

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,820
在沙发上睡着
...Sleeping in his chair...

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,010
对着费城人队大叫
...Yelling at the Phillies...

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,130
这算是什么投球
What is that pitch?!

11
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,730
在沙发上睡着
...And sleeping in his chair.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,190
他的为父之道也很简单
Even his parenting style was simple

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,160
总是涉及了选择性的词汇
and always involved choice vocab words.

14
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,470
小白痴们  别再这么白痴了
Hey, you morons. Stop being morons.

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,380
不敢相信  我养了个白痴
Unreal. I raised a moron.

16
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,700
你为什么总是这么白痴
Why you got to be a moron all the time?

17
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,330
他是个简单的人  说实话  对什么都没兴趣
He wasn't a complicated guy or, frankly, even that interesting.

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,520
但隔三差五的
But every once in a while,

19
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,840
他会意外展现出一面
he was accidentally reveal something about himself

20
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,580
会让你觉得你根本不认识他
that would make you feel like you didn't know him at all.

21
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,130
好的  修好了
All right, all fixed.

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,840
了不起  你在哪里学的
Wow! Where did you learn how to do that?

23
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,900
军队
Army.

24
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,460
什么  你刚说的是"军队"吗
What? Did you say "Army"?

25
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,490
爸  这是你和卢・里德吗[摇滚歌手]
Dad, is this you and Lou Reed?

26
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,630
对  我们一起做过服务生
Yeah, we, uh, waited tables together.

27
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,850
什么  接着讲
What? Tell me more.

28
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,230
就是这样了
Eh, it was a whole thing.

29
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,100
别走  回来  我想了解你
Wait! Come back! I want to know you!

30
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,190
拉升  拉升
Pull up! Pull up!

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,390
飞机要坠毁了
You're gonna crash the plane.

32
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,070
我曾经经历过一次坠机
I was in a plane crash once.

33
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,060
午睡时间到
Nap time.

34
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,440
没错  有些人会吹嘘想当年
Yep, some people glorify the past,

35
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,630
但我爸不会
but not my dad.

36
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,840
对他来说  过去似乎没发生过
To him, it's like it never even happened.

37
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,920
我的天  默里  你不会相信的
Oh, my god, Murray, you're not gonna believe it.

38
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,060
你就读的高中刚才打来电话
I just got off the phone with your old high school.

39
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,900
你的纪录被刷新了
Your record has been broken.

40
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,440
慢着  爸读高中时还有纪录吗
Whoa, wait. Dad had a record in high school?

41
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,490
什么样的纪录
What kind of record?

42
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,020
辣椒酱  他爱辣椒酱
Chili! He loves chili.

43
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,420
肯定是和辣椒酱有关的
It's something to do with chili.

44
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,760
他的确喜欢  但不是的
True, but that's not it.

45
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,320
你爸创下了中心高中的
Your dad set the record for most free throws in a row

46
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,670
连续罚球纪录
at Central High.

47
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,420
篮球吗  说什么呢
Like, in basketball? W-what are you talking about?

48
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,220
叫我怎么说  我们赢了州比赛
What can I say? We won state.

49
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,440
我连着进了79个的罚球
Uh, I hit 79 free throws in a row.

50
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,760
你想我怎样
Uh, what do you want from me?

51
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,520
默里  高中想请你回去
Murray, the high school wants you to go back

52
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,200
这样周六晚的比赛  他们可以向你致敬
so they can honor you at the game Saturday night.

53
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,390
我们要住在市区
We get to stay downtown,

54
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,410
而且还会有宴会
and there's gonna be a banquet.

55
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,520
宴会
A banquet?!

56
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,620
这是食物派对中最高级的
That's the fanciest of all food parties!

57
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,750
我知道  这是大事
I know! It's a very big deal.

58
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,980
我是这样想的  不去
Here's the thing about that. Pass.

59
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,330
-不能不去  -不去
- No pass. - Pass!

60
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,080
-我已经说了你会去  -你为什么这样做
- I already told them you'd be there.- Why would you do that?

61
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,840
你知道我对任何事都没兴趣
You know I don't have an interest in things.

62
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,080
这是真的吗
Is this for real?

63
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,620
我们甚至没见过你碰篮球
I mean, we've never even seen you touch a basketball.

64
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,530
真是不敢相信
Yeah, I mean, I can't believe this.

65
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,790
我的梦想之一就是进NBA打球
It's one of my dreams to play in the NBA,

66
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,400
而你却一次也没提过这事
and you never once mentioned it?

67
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,480
没看出来有什么关系
Didn't see how it was relevant.

68
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,600
关系可大了
Oh, it's relevant.

69
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,760
你打算怎么做  你打算怎么做
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

70
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,570
你打算怎么做  你打算怎么做
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

71
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,360
跟现在做的差不多
Not much more than what I'm doing right now.

72
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,950
我想看看你的水平  罚球帝
I want you to show me what you got, free-throw king!

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,230
完事了吗
Are we, uh, done here yet?

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,760
不  你显然是受欢迎的高中大神
No! You were clearly some type of popular high school god.

75
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,900
告诉我是什么样子的
Tell me what it was like.

76
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,680
不知道  我约会了不少姑娘
I don't know. I, uh, dated a lot of girls.

77
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,750
我参加了不少派对
I went to parties.

78
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,010
我当选了几次班长
I got elected class president a few times.

79
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,030
午餐大婶免费请我吃果冻
Lunch lady gave me free jell-o.

80
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,820
很平常
Eh, the usual.

81
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,820
不平常  这完全与我的生活相反
Not usual. That's the opposite of my life.

82
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,900
午餐大婶说我
The lunch lady said

83
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,220
看起来像烧了她村子的军阀
I look like the warlord who burnt down her village.

84
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,960
-我进去了  -不  等等  拜托
- I'm going in. - No, wait, wait! Come on!

85
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,450
我以为你要给我指点两下
I thought you were gonna give me some pointers.

86
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,230
除非你想让我指点你两下
Unless you want me to give you some.

87
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,890
三分线以外怎么样
How about from way downtown?

88
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,160
希望你带了伞
Hope you brought an umbrella,

89
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,870
因为要下三分球雨了
'cause it's about to rain some 3s!

90
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,000

95

投篮就是要这样
And that's how you do it.

96
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,430
你好吗  拉克茜・布鲁姆

98
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,400
好的

99
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,020
这一年  巴瑞把整个年鉴留空
This year, Barry left an entire page blank

100
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,120
只为了一个他在乎的签名

101
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,900
他的梦中女孩  拉克茜・布鲁姆

103
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,850
我不是瑞典交换生
I'm not the swedish exchange student!

104
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,590
我跟你说的可是英语

105
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,420
挥棒落空
Swing and a miss.

106
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,090
你爱她  她却以为你是从瑞典来的
Aw, you love her, and she thinks you're from Sweden.

107
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,440
我这一整年都在努力打出自己的名号
I've spent all year trying to make a name for myself,

108
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,420
但拉克茜・布鲁姆依然不知道我是谁
and Lexy Bloom still doesn't know who I am.

109
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,620
她真幸运
She's so lucky.

110
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,690
如果能有一种办法  能和全校最酷的学生
If only there was a way to, like, have a casual get-together

111
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,710
随意地聚在一起
with the coolest kids from school,

112
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,180
比如说在我们家
like, at our house,

113
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,990
但没有正式的晚宴

114
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,520
我想你说的是派对
I think you're describing a party.

115
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,300
我的天  我有一个好棒的主意

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,470
咱家没有游泳池
We don't have a pool.

140
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,090
没有吗
Don't we?

141
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,040
吹起来
Blow this up.

142
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,900
太棒了
Sweet!

143
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,060
我去拿哮喘吸入器  这就开始吹
I'm gonna go grab my inhaler and get started.

144
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,140
好了
Okay!

145
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,800
我这里有扭扭乐和烟灰缸
I got twister and ashtrays.

146
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,590
派对什么时候开始
What time's this party kicking off?

147
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,010
慢着  你没意见吗
Whoa, wait. You're okay with this?

148
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,290
我不认同对你父母撒谎
Uh, look, I-I don't condone lying to your parents,

149
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,240
但我看着你这年起起伏伏
but I've been tracking your highs and lows this year.

150
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,060
说实话  你需要这个
And frankly, you need this.

151
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,230
太棒了
Awesome!

152
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,540
现在只剩下确保
Only thing left is to make sure

153
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,950
爸妈走的时候不疑心就行了
mom and dad leave without suspecting a thing.

154
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,650
好了  我的宝贝
Okay, love bugs.

155
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,040
我们晚上不在  你们得听老爷子的
Pops is in charge while we're away for the evening.

156
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,900
玩得开心
Have fun.

157
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,910
怎么会开心
No fun here.

158
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,260
我们会坐在这里闷到死
We're just gonna sit here bored to death

159
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,420
等你们回家
waiting for you to come home.

160
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,070
这样的话  穿上鞋子跟我们走
Oh, well, in that case, throw on some shoes and join us!

161
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,830
就这样定了
I insist.

162
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,360
那就这样  我们也去
Then it's settled. We're coming.

163
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,960
-你做什么 -我慌了
- What are you doing? - Panicking.

164
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,100
如果孩子们一起去  我就留家里
Okay, if the kids come with us, I'm staying home.

165
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,670
太好了  留下
Great! Stay.

166
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,660
你什么毛病啊
What's wrong with you?!

167
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,710
人越多越好
The more the merrier.

168
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,540
你真是个超级蠢的笨蛋
You're a stupid, stupid boy.

169
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,500
你们去吧  这里有我
Y-you two just go. I'll hold down the fort.

170
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,520
-好吧  -晚餐在冰箱里
- All right. - Dinner's in the fridge.

171
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,440
好险啊
That was a close one.

172
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,750
我们合作得太棒了
We make a good team, guys.

173
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,250
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen...

174
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,080
巴瑞等不及他的史诗经典夜开始时
While Barry couldn't wait to start his epic night,

175
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,430
我爸依然对他的漠不关心
My dad was still indifferent about his...

176
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,830
1961年州冠军队的队长
...Captain of the 1961 state championship team

177
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,050
默里・金伯格
Murray Goldberg!

178
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,880
直到他看到这一幕
...Until this happened.

179
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,780
这是怎么啦
What the hell's going on?

180
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,090
这些人什么毛病啊
What's wrong with these people?

181
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,940
没什么  他们爱你 默里
Nothing -- they love you, Murray.

182
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,280
对我爸来说  过去已经过去了
For my dad, the past was the past.

183
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,220
他从来不想
He never wanted to be

184
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,790
做那种总是追忆当年辉煌的人
one of those guys always recounting his glory days.

185
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,360
但在那闪耀的时刻  他决定拥抱过去
But for one shining moment, he decided to embrace it.

186
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,200
加油  海狸们  加油
Let's go, beavers! Let's go!

187
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,130
咬咬咬
Chomp, chomp, chomp!

188
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,240
我爸多年没碰篮球了
My dad hadn't picked up a basketball in years.

189
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,400
但上半场结束时
But by the end of the first half,

190
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,910
他已经整装待发了
he was ready to suit up.

191
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,390
篮球就是这样打的  海狸们
That's how we do it, beavers!

192
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,780
太棒了
Yeah!

193
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,250
在这里简短说几句
Just want to take a quick moment

194
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,480
欢迎默里・金伯格回到母校
to welcome back Murray Goldberg.

195
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,680
为纪念他25年的纪录
In honor of his 25-year-old record,

196
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,650
我们要送给他
we'd like to present him

197
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,630
这个全队签名的篮球
with a ball signed by the entire team.

198
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,830
默里  过来吧
Murray, come on down.

199
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,860
嘿  高手
Hey, hot stuff!

200
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,910
谢谢  太感谢了
Thank you. Thank you very much.

201
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,680
射篮  射篮  射篮
Shoot the ball! Shoot the ball! Shoot the ball!

202
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,630
射篮  射篮
Shoot the ball! Shoot the ball!

203
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,200
射篮  射篮
Shoot the ball! Shoot the ball!

204
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,820
不是吧  你做什么呢
Really? What are you doing?

205
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,090
射篮  射篮
Shoot the ball! Shoot the ball!

206
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,800
那是我老公
That's my husband!

207
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,720
我爸站到罚球线的那一刻
The moment my dad stepped to that line,

208
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,440
他意识到他依然是高中时的那个少年
he realized he was still that kid from high school --

209
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,660
运动员  传奇  冠军
An athlete, a legend, a champion.

210
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,920
结果  他这样做了
and then, he did this.

211
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,730
拍到了
Got it!

212
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,450
你好差劲  老家伙
You suck, old man!

213
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,890
为他说句话  这种罚球方式在他年轻时
In his defense, that was a very common shooting style

214
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,900
非常流行
back in the day.

215
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,770
但随着"三不沾"的嘘声响彻体育馆
But as the chant of "Air ball" rang through the gym,

216
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,090
只是证明了我爸
it only confirmed to my dad

217
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,850
不属于这个球场
that he didn't belong on that court.

218
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,990
他的归属是穿着内裤  坐在电视机前
He belonged in front of the tv in his underpants.

219
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,820
但这还不是当晚最尴尬的一幕
But this wasn't the most embarrassing display of the evening.

220
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,660
最尴尬的还是我哥史诗经典的派对
That belonged to my brother's epic party.

221
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,610
已经九点了
It was 9:00,

222
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,490
到场的人只有我
and the only people that showed up were me,

223
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,080
罗杰・麦克法登  他带了妙脆角来
Roger Mcfadden, who brought bugles,

224
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,000
还有外国交换生  古斯塔夫
and Gustav, the foreign-exchange student.

225
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,070
回见  我出去了
Later. I'm going out.

226
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,960
慢着  慢着
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

227
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,250
看那里
Look -- look what's happening in there.

228
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,520
全男生聚会
It's a pure sausage fest.

229
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,430
妙脆角只有漂亮女生才可以吃
The bugles are for hot chicks only!

230
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,770
你是个受欢迎的女生  请一些你的朋友过来
You're a popular girl. Invite some of your friends over.

231
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,710
那可怜的家伙需要这场派对
The poor guy needs this.

232
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,090
闭嘴  古斯塔夫
Shut up, Gustav!

233
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,690
这叫做恰到好处的姗姗来迟
It's called being fashionably late.

234
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,540
好吧  我打电话给几个朋友
Fine. I'll call a couple of my friends.

235
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,850
谢谢
Thank you.

236
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,720
现在  这事一个推特就能搞定
Nowadays, all it would take is a tweet.

237
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,240
但那时  一个电话也同样能搞定
But back then, one phone call worked just as well.

238
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,330
你不是说几个朋友吗
I thought you said "A couple of friends."

239
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,750
我就打给了兰妮
All I did was call Lainey.

240
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,770
你想要巴瑞玩得开心对吗
You wanted Barry to have fun, right?

241
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,470
瞧瞧他  完全是大人物
Look at the guy. He is the man.

242
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,290
欢迎来到巴瑞的家  女士们
Welcome to casa de Barry, ladies!

243
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,650
气色不错  裤子很不错嘛  不认识的哥们
Looking good. Nice pants, random dude.

244
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,170
告诉过你我能行的
Told you I'd rock.

245
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,400
这场派对完全就像是饶舌歌MTV对吗
Is the party like a rap video, or what?

246
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,230
一边凉快去  罗斯姨妈的50大寿
Move over, aunt Rose's 50th.

247
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,070
这是咱家餐厅见识过的最热闹的派对
This is the hottest party this dining room's ever seen.

248
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,080
我的妈呀  是拉克茜・布鲁姆
Holy crap. It's Lexy Bloom.

249
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,290
她来了
She came!

250
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,290
她在这里
She's here!

251
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,640
你还在等什么  老哥
What are you waiting for, man?

252
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,500
扔颗口香糖
Chiclet me.

253
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,590
美女
Whoa, girl.

254
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,530
看来你找到了贵宾区
I see you found the V.I.P. Section.

255
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,210
为什么这里是贵宾区
What makes this the V.I.P. Section?

256
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,350
因为我在这里
'cause I'm here.

257
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,920
你要什么  我就能提供什么
Anything you want, I'll make it happen.

258
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,580
水果卷  百吉饼
Fruit roll-ups? Bagel bites?

259
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,040
摩登原始人牌维生素片
Flintstone vitamins?

260
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,950
你想要什么都有  亲爱的
The world's your oyster, baby.

261
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,930
看见没
See?

262
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,420
我们刚给了你奇怪的弟弟
We just gave your weird little brother

263
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,300
他人生中最美好的一晚
the best night of his life.

264
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,860
本大爷来了
Whoo! The party has arrived!

265
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,350
你和他同校吗
You go to school with him?

266
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,850
没有
I do not.

267
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,970
情况失控了
And we're out of hand.

268
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,620
谁要去冲澡
Who wants to take a shower?

269
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,840
十点时  巴瑞的派对气氛爆发了
By 10:00, Barry's party was blowing up...

270
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,470
但没有我姐爆发得那么厉害
But not as much as my sister.

271
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,850
住手  撒得到处都是
Hey! Stop! You're spilling everywhere!

272
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,410
你们两个
You!

273
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,270
不准在我爸的沙发上亲热
Stop making out in my dad's chair!

274
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,730
这是他的栖息地
He lives there!

275
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,290
搞什么  这是我妈妈的
What the hell?! That's my mom's!

276
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,440
为什么你穿着
Why are you wearing that?

277
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,780
这是场毛衣派对
Oh, it's a sweater party.

278
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,890
根本没这回事
That's not a thing.

279
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,300
我在楼梯上挂了"禁止入内"的标语
And I put a sign on the stairs that said "Off limits."

280
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,300
挂着的线断了
Ah, yeah, that piece of yarn broke,

281
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,730
所以我们就不客气了
so we all just kind of... Helped ourselves.

282
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,820
我们
"We"?

283
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,890
脱下  所有人脱下
Off! Everyone take it off!

284
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,170
太棒了  终于发生了  快脱下
Yes! It's happening! Take it off!

285
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,950
亚当  上楼去
Adam, go upstairs!

286
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,720
标语上写着"禁止入内"
Well, the sign says it's off limits.

287
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,350
线断了  给我上楼
The yarn is broken. Upstairs.

288
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,420
我说了上楼
I said "Upstairs"!

289
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,000
好了  局面正式失控了
Okay. This is officially nuts.

290
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,520
你要结束这一切
You need to put an end to this.

291
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,330
我  你才是成年人
Me?! You're the adult!

292
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,310
我是酷外公  我不能做扫兴鬼
I'm the cool grandpa. I can't be the bummer.

293
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,940
你做扫兴鬼
You be the bummer.

294
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,950
有块披萨在唱片机上
Uh, there's a pizza on the record player.

295
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,050
这样对唱片针可不好
It's bad for the needle.

296
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,100
你们这些人真恶心
You people are disgusting!

297
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,900
你到底在做什么
What the hell are you doing?!

298
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,030
这是场毛衣派对
It's a sweater party.

299
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,540
根本没这回事
That's not a thing!

300
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,050
别再煽风点火  你要结束派对
Stop encouraging this. You need to shut it down.

301
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,460
结束
Shut it down?

302
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,960
不可能  这是我的派对
No way! This is my party.

303
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,900
我说我们要狂欢到黎明
And I say we rage on until the crack of dawn!!

304
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,660
好棒
Yeah!

305
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,900
我说每人捡点垃圾后走人
Well, I say we each pick up one piece of trash and leave!

306
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,550
呸
Boo!

307
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,390
想笑你就笑  够了
Smile all you want. That's it.

308
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,620
我给爸妈住的酒店打电话
I'm calling the hotel where mom and dad are staying.

309
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,120
我明白是怎么回事
I see what this is.

310
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,170
你嫉妒了
You're jealous

311
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,690
因为我办了场有史以来最棒的派对
'cause I've thrown the greatest party of all time.

312
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,730
你好好看看  这不是你的派对
Look around. It's not your party.

313
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,390
这些全是我的朋友
These are all my friends.

314
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,370
喂  艾里
Yo, Ari.

315
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,620
这是谁的派对
Whose party is this?

316
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,320
爱丽卡为那个瑞典小子举办的送别派对
Erica's throwing a going-away party for the swedish dude.

317
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,320
不重要  拉克茜・布鲁姆来了
It doesn't matter. Lexy Bloom's here.

318
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,380
她是来见我的
She came to see me.

319
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,680
是吗
Oh, did she?

320
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,130
巴瑞  等等
Barry, wait.

321
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,470
我不是故意...
I didn't mean to --

322
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,280
刚才不太顺利
That did not go well.

323
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,270
是的
No, it did not.

324
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,660
你为什么这么生我的气
Why are you so mad at me?

325
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,070
我看到你的表情了
I saw the look on your face.

326
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,110
你很激动重返球场
You were thrilled to be back out there on that court.

327
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,800
你知道我为什么不谈过去吗
You know why I don't talk about the past?

328
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,860
我来告诉我
I'm gonna tell you.

329
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,820
因为过去很棒
Because it was great.

330
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,380
我是班长  我是篮球明星
I was class president. I was a basketball star.

331
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,750
我是英雄
I was a hero.

332
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,490
现在我什么也不是
And now I'm just none of those things.

333
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,010
你试过这样投篮吗
Have you ever tried shooting the ball this way?

334
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,500
当年这种投法非常流行
It was a very common shooting style!

335
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,580
结果  我爸不是唯一懊恼至极的人
Turns out, my dad wasn't the only one kicking himself.

336
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,920
巴瑞与成为传奇
Barry's big chance

337
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,640
赢取拉克茜・布鲁姆芳心的重大机会
to become a legend and win over Lexy Bloom

338
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,100
正式吻别了
had literally been kissed goodbye.

339
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,420
怎么啦  古斯塔夫
What's shaking, Gustav?

340
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,490
我倒希望自己是古斯塔夫
I wish I was Gustav.

341
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,360
除了无法接受他带的午餐总是有奇怪的鱼
Except for that weird fish lunch he always brings.

342
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,360
你为什么出来了  不在自己的派对上待着
So, why you out here, missing your own party?

343
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,860
我注意到
Well, it has come to my attention

344
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,470
这是爱丽卡的派对
that this is Erica's party,

345
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,950
我只是个巨大的被大家无视的倒霉蛋
and I'm just a big, giant, invisible bag of suck.

346
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,200
拜托  大家没无视你
Oh, come on. You're not invisible.

347
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,510
你是巴瑞・金伯格  冲午餐大婶发飙的人
You're Barry Goldberg, the guy who freaked out

348
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,320
因为没有布丁了
on the lunch lady because they ran out of pudding.

349
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,960
为什么大家就记得我这件事
Why is that the only thing anyone ever remembers about me?

350
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,620
学校保证了有布丁  但结果没有
Hey, they promised pudding. They had no pudding.

351
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,000
那是黑暗的一天
It was a dark day.

352
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,230
我知道你觉得今年很不顺
Look, I know you feel like this year was a bust,

353
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,200
但你做了不少令人印象深刻的事
but you did a ton of cool stuff --

354
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,830
才艺表演上的空手道
Karate in the talent show.

355
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,200
你参加了摔角队
You're on the wrestling team.

356
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,300
你拍了饶舌MTV
You did that rap video

357
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,070
讲述了摩天轮上的心动故事
about stone cold groovin' on a ferris wheel.

358
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,530
-你喜欢我的饶舌歌  -太好笑了
- You like my rap? - It's hilarious.

359
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,390
你的目的就是要搞笑对吗
Wait, that's what you were going for, right?

360
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,660
是的
Yeah!

361
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,540
你怎么知道我这么多事
How do you know so much stuff about me?

362
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,310
你姐是我最好的朋友
Your sister's my best friend.

363
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,450
我已经认识你一辈子了
I've known you my whole life,

364
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,330
我可以诚实地说
and I can honestly say there's...

365
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,000
你与众不同
No one like you.

366
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,300
谢谢
Thanks.

367
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,210
谁会想到我姐开放的  有着坏影响的最佳损友
Who knew my sister's wild, bad-influence best friend

368
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,730
居然以奇怪的  巴瑞的方式
would be the one to remind my brother that he was special

369
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,520
提醒了我哥他是特别的
in his own bizarre, Barry kind of way?

370
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,140
别再郁闷了
Now stop pouting

371
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,680
进去让爱丽卡的朋友们看看  这到底是谁的派对
and come show Erica's friends whose party it really is.

372
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,940
很长时间以来第一次
For the first time in ages,

373
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,320
对我哥来说有了盼头
things were looking up for my big bro.

374
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,280
但好景不长
It didn't last long.

375
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,750
我的天
Oh, god!

376
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,260
死了
Oh, balls!

377
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,860
大家试着收拾一下
Everybody try and clean up a little bit!

378
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,450
我去睡觉了  大家快逃命吧
I-I'm going to bed! Everyone, run!

379
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,080
巴瑞看着爸妈走下车
As Barry watched my parents get out of that car,

380
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,160
他知道只有一件事可以做
he knew there was only one thing to do --

381
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,360
吓傻掉
Freak out.

382
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,510
妈  爸
Mom! Dad!

383
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,500
你们怎么回来啦
Why are you home?

384
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,760
你们应该待在酒店
You're supposed to be at the hotel!

385
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,660
有宴会啊  谁会错过宴会
There was a banquet! Who skips a banquet?!

386
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,990
派对
A party?!

387
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,640
我连自己的孩子都不喜欢
I don't even like my own kids,

388
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,380
更别说一屋子的陌生人
let alone a house full of other people's!

389
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,570
默里  老天爷  他们穿的是我的毛衣
Murray! Oh, my god. They're wearing my sweaters!

390
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,830
不  那些不是你的
No! Those aren't yours!

391
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,170
现在就流行这样  看看MTV台就知道
It's a look that's happening! Watch MTV!

392
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,840
是啊  我确信所有年轻男生
Yeah, I'm sure all the young boys

393
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,720
现在都穿豹子图案的毛衣
are wearing leopard sweaters.

394
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,090
喂  那是我的豹子
Hey! That's my leopard!

395
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,480
好吧  显然  你们会杀了我
Okay, fine. Clearly, you're gonna kill me, and --

396
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,070
是的  我会的
Yes! Yes, I am!

397
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,460
快点  默里  徒手宰了这不孝子
Do it, Murray. Do it with your hands.

398
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,240
请听我说
Just hear me out, please.

399
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,950
我和你完全不同  爸
I'm nothing like you, dad.

400
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,090
在高中我不是老大
I don't dominate in high school.

401
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,230
我没有保持体育纪录
I don't hold sports records.

402
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,010
大家认识我  只是因为我为布丁发怒了
People only know me 'cause I get angry at pudding.

403
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,580
听我说  你有着辉煌的过去
Listen, you've had your glory days,

404
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,350
听起来棒极了
and they sounded awesome.

405
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,840
但这个  这里的一切
But this, in there,

406
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,890
我最好也就只能做到这样了
this is the best I'm ever gonna do.

407
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,090
宝贝  太可怜了
Oh, boopie. That's so sad.

408
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,880
但你的麻烦可大了
But you are in so much trouble.

409
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,780
但是  好可怜
But...Aww.

410
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,540
我求你们了  这是我的时刻
I'm begging you. This is my moment.

411
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,630
我只要求
All I'm asking for

412
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,530
再多七个小时的连续派对
is seven more hours of nonstop partying.

413
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,560
当然不行
Absolutely not.

414
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,040
你有十分钟
You got 10 minutes.

415
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,760
-真的吗  -就当帮我一个忙
- Seriously? - Yeah, but do me a favor.

416
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,670
让今晚成为你永生难忘的夜晚
Make this a night you'll always remember.

417
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,930
你是地球上最好的父亲
You are the greatest father on this planet.

418
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,020
我哥拼命地冲向
As my brother desperately sprinted off

419
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,400
他十分钟的辉煌时
for his 10 minutes of glory,

420
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,460
我爸意识到  他依然可以做
my dad realized he could still be a hero

421
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,170
对他来说真正重要之人的英雄
to someone who actually mattered.

422
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,350
糟糕的为父之道
Awful parenting choice.

423
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,930
糟糕透了
Just awful.

424
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,620
你也看到他跑步的样子了  他需要这个
You've seen him run. He needs this.

425
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,140
就是这样  巴瑞的学年进入了尾声
This was it -- Barry's year was coming to a close,

426
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,300
以最后的神奇十分钟谢幕
and it all came down to 10 magical minutes.

427
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,090
他知道只有一种方法留下自己的标志
He knew there was only one way to leave his mark.

428
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,370
那就是在舞池上
That was on the dance floor.

429
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,170
虽然他与迈克尔・杰克逊相距甚远
He may have been a far cry from Michael Jackson.

430
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,030
但在那一刻  他觉得自己杰克逊附体了
But in that moment, he sure felt like him.

431
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,630
让大家围拢来的
It wasn't just Barry's enthusiasm

432
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,110
不仅是巴瑞的热情
that brought the crowd together.

433
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,920
还有他那巨大的80年代录音机
It was his giant '80s boom box

434
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,310
大声唱出了我们青春的圣歌
blasting out the anthem of our youth.

435
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,680
听起来是这样的
And it sounded like this.

436
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,780
我们一定会成功
Oh, we're halfway there

437
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,600
活在祈祷中
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

438
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,270
牵着我的手
Take my hand

439
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,460
我发誓  我们一定会成功
We'll make it, I swear

440
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,420
活在祈祷中
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

441
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,830
那家伙是谁
Who is that guy?

442
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,410
那是巴瑞・金伯格  这是他的派对
That's Barry Goldbg. This is his party.

443
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,410
兄弟  拉克茜・布鲁姆看着这边
Dude, Lexy Bloom's looking over here.

444
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,540
我该怎么做
What do I do?

445
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,150
我会帮你  你想让她嫉妒吗
I'm gonna help you out. You ready to make her jealous?

446
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,310
让她什么
Make her what?

447
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,970
你做什么
What are you doing?

448
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,050
好痛  我不知道  你做什么
Ow! I don't know! What are you doing?

449
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,680
这是我这辈子最美好的夜晚
This is the greatest night of my life!

450
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,460
时间到  滚出我的家
Times up! Get the hell out of my house!

451
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,720
留下我的毛衣
And leave my sweaters!

452
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,740
自然而然  我哥被禁足整个暑假
Naturally, my brother was grounded for the entire summer.

453
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,920
你要把我所有的毛衣拿去干洗
And you get to take all my sweaters to the dry cleaners.

454
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,960
但有时候
But sometimes,

455
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,790
为了那神奇的时刻  怎样都值得
those magic moments are worth it.

456
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,960
我非常生气  你胆子真不小  年轻人
I'm very upset. You have a lot of nerve, young man.

457
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,080
那是他将永生铭记的一晚
It was a night he'd carry with him forever,

458
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,250
没人可以夺走的一晚
A night no one could take away.

459
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,440
在那短暂的一刻
For one brief moment,

460
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,350
巴瑞・金伯格是个传奇
Barry Goldberg was a legend.

461
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,600
你想听听  我是怎么认识卢・里德的吗
Y-you want to hear about, uh, how I met Lou Reed?

462
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,350
想
Uh, yeah.

463
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,870
好的  那是1965年
Okay. It was 1965...

464
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,090
当然  我爸永远会是那种
Sure, my dad would always be the kind of guy

465
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,850
喜爱电视和懒人沙发的人
who loved his tv and his la-z-boy.

466
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,140
但在那命中注定的一晚后
But after that fateful night,

467
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,500
他觉得敞开心扉容易些了
he found it easier to open up a bit more.

468
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,960
进啊  宝贝
Swish, baby!

469
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,070
据我计算
Okay, by my count,

470
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,590
你之前22球全没投进
you've missed the last 22 shots.

471
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,520
按我的方式投一次吧
Just do it my way once.

472
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,070
好吧
Fine.

473
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,070
进啊  宝贝
Swish, baby!

474
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,530
新的投篮方式
New shooting style!

475
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,740
更疯狂的是
And, even crazier,

476
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,530
巴瑞让我爸  罚球帝
Barry got my dad, the free-throw king...

477
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,720
重返球场给他一些指导
...Back on the court for some actual pointers.

478
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,940
无形资产
Intangibles!

479
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,840
但帮助不大
It didn't help much.

480
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,110
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

481
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,250
你长得这么可爱  球技多烂也没关系
You're delicious no matter how bad you are.

482
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,460
见鬼  巴瑞
Oh, damn it, Barry!

483
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,890
说到我的童年
When it comes to my childhood,

484
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,090
也许我并不能总记得
I may not always remember...

485
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,160
事情发生的具体时间
...exactly when something happened,

486
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,690
或是参与者都有谁
or exactly who was there.

487
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,010
但我知道  那是一九八几年
But I do know that it was 1980-something

488
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,180
超级棒的金色年代
and it was awesome.

489
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,660
别再拍了  出去  妈
Stop videotaping! Get out! Mom!

490
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,480
献给我真正的家人

491
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,760
别拍了  我发誓...
Stop! I swear...

492
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,750
致命一击  致命一击
Death blow. Death blow.

493
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,920
你把我给惹火了  小兔崽子
You're aggravating me, you little bastard!

494
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,200
他把我给惹火了  小兔崽子
He's aggravating me, the little bastard!

495
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,860
你为什么要打自己
Why are you hitting yourself, huh?

496
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,080
你脸怎么你啦
What did your face ever do to you?

497
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,330
打开
Open up.

498
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,600
不  就不  就不
No! No! No! No! No!

499
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,130
就不  就不
No. No. No. No.

500
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,390
我的天  这个家真是疯了
My god. This house is going nuts.

501
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,670
这个家真是疯了
This house is going nuts.

502
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,900
我是擎天柱
I am optimus prime,

503
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,530
我是好人  我会打败你
and I am a good guy, and I will kick your butt!

504
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,290
谁啊
Who's there?

505
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,500
快换好衣服
Get dressed now!

506
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,970
快换好衣服
Get dressed now.

507
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,940
就是这样了
And this is it.

508
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,930
啊  好痛
Aah! That hurt! Aah!

509
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,090
真是疯狂的一晚
Whoa, what a night.

510
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,180
还好吗  有没有橙汁
What's up? You got any O.J.?

511
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,050
不好意思  你在这里做什么
I'm sorry, what the hell are you doing here?

512
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,030
派对上我醉倒在地下室了
Ah, I passed out in the basement during the party.

513
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,660
脱下我的毛衣后出去
Take off my sweater and get out.

514
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,050
-我有什么好处  -没有  这是我的毛衣
- What's in it for me? - Nothing. It's my sweater.

515
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,880
好吧
Fine.

516
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,510
-给我看咪咪  -不
- Show me your boobs. - No!

517
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,110
-给我一百万  -不
- Then give me $1 million. - No.

518
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,080
我想重启咪咪话题
I'd very much like to revisit the boob conversation.

519
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,710
[贝弗莉帮默里拿回沙发那次]

520
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,710
我觉得我们有过一次这样的对话
I feel like we've done this once before.

521
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,510
-最后我看到了咪咪吗  -没有
- Did it end in boobs? - No.

522
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,710
告诉我
Tell me something.

523
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,040
你最后一次吃营养均衡的早餐是什么时候
When was the last time you had a balanced breakfast?

524
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,940
每一天
Every day.

525
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,300
牛肉干提供蛋白质  糖霜提供能量
Protein from beef jerky, energy from frosting.

526
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,490
亲爱的  坐下吧  我帮你做吃的
Sweetie, sit down. I'm gonna make you some food.

527
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,390
你吃完后
You're gonna eat it.

528
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,920
脱下我的毛衣  给我走人
Then you're gonna take off my sweater and get the hell out.

529
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,320
早啊  巴瑞
Morning, Barry.

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
