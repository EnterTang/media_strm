11
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,000
Back in the '80s, before you could buy anything you wanted

12
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,110
with a click of a mouse,

13
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,720
shopping was more of a contact sport.

14
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,820
And no one was better at it than my mom.

15
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,900
Remember, dented cans are 50% off.

16
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,240
I made it easy for you. They're all dented.

17
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,050
Now they're all dented.

18
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,440
I don't care if it is a misprint.

19
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,890
This ad says that

20
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,550
that lawn mower is $9.99,

21
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,030
and I am not leaving until you honor this price.

22
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,320
There was no bargain too small, too large,

23
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,740
or too dangerous for Beverly Goldberg.

24
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,630
I'm not exaggerating. This really happened.

25
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,010
Mom, they're slipping!

26
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,280
Don't you dare let go.

27
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,550
Use the tag! Hold on tight!

28
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,460
It's ripping! It says "do not remove"!

29
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,020
Dad, slow down! We can't hold them.

30
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,920
No. Speed up. They'll stabilize at a higher speed.

31
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,010
This isn't worth it!

32
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,680
They were buy two, get two free.

33
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,200
It's totally worth it.

34
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,660
Pumpkin.

35
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,770
Big news about the winter formal.

36
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,470
Found a great price on that dress you wanted.

37
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,130
Is it behind this picture of a dress I don't want?

38
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,720
Seriously, I don't want some crappy knock off.

39
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,140
Dad, little help?

40
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,030
Here's all I know about fashion.

41
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,690
I like blue. That's it.

42
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,550
Then let me explain how it works.

43
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,890
You have to spend money to look nice.

44
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,210
Or you could grab some of the old dresses in your closet,

45
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,880
cut 'em up, and make a new one in the current style.

46
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,860
Like, um, that movie with, uh, the girl with the face.

47
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,410
Mom, he's upsetting me.

48
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,880
- You should go. - I'll go.

49
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,270
Look at these prices, Erica.

50
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,940
It's gonna be so much fun. Discount Barn, here we come.

51
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,510
No! No discount barn or huts or warehouses.

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,520
I'm tired of always asking you guys for money.

53
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,770
I'getting a job.

54
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,580
A job? You're just a child.

55
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,140
I can't have you losing a foot in a forklift accident.

56
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,420
Forklift?

57
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,700
Patty Newsome's son got his foot crushed

58
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,750
his first day at the lumberyard.

59
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,570
He'll never bike through Europe now.

60
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,670
Is that what you want?

61
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,710
Brenda said she could get me a job with her at Gimbels, okay?

62
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,730
I'll finally have my own money.

63
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,490
Plus I get a big employee discount.

64
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,520
That magic word was all my mom needed to hear.

65
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,260
Well, who am I to stand in your way?

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,040
That settles it. You're getting a discount.

67
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,890
Job. You're getting a job.

68
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,280
I'm just so happy for us.

69
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,060
You. I'm happy for all of us.

70
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,860
Oh. Discount.

71
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,020
It was November 19th, 1980-something,

72
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,670
and like every afternoon, I was spending quality time

73
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,540
with my good friend Nintendo.

74
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,960
Come on, slugger. Let's hit the track.

75
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,370
The ponies are waiting.

76
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,520
One sec. I'm so close to winning "Zelda,"

77
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,950
I can taste it.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,780
Six months of hard work is about to pay off.

79
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,740
You know what I did in six months?

80
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,240
Win world war II.

81
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,160
I get it! You lived a rich life! Enough!

82
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,920
I'm sorry. I'm under a lot of pressure here.

83
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,710
This game is all I have.

84
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,540
Guess whose life sucks a big sack of marbles.

85
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,320
Just guess.

86
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,220
All right, Barry, what now?

87
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,330
First period, backpack rips open. Bad luck.

88
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,930
Second period, I fail my pop quiz. Super bad luck.

89
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,360
Third period gym, we're playing basketball,

90
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,720
and a bird dooks on my face.

91
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,870
He dooks on my face!

92
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,660
Actually, when a bird goes poo-poo on you,

93
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,550
it's good luck.

94
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,370
Oh, really? Well, after school,

95
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,490
I asked Jen Sperling to the winter formal,

96
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,950
and she told me Ryan Corbett just asked her

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,520
two minutes before me.

98
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,510
I don't just have bad luck. I have Barry luck.

99
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,730
Why don't you come to the track with us?

100
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,860
Pops, don't do that. He's a jinx.

101
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,690
Shut up! I'll blind you with my fists!

102
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,570
But he's right. I'm the worst.

103
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,610
Stop talking that way.

104
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,300
All you need is a positive attitude,

105
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,320
and you'll find your luck's as good as anyone's.

106
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,960
- You think? - I know.

107
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,820
You're sitting on my bagel bites.

108
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,510
What?

109
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,410
Damn it!

110
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,740
Stupid Barry luck!

111
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,340
Thanks for coming. Come back soon.

112
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,440
How are we doing over here?

113
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,350
Terrific. Just sold an extended warranty

114
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,490
for a basketball.

115
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,530
Nice work, Erica. You keep that up,

116
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,260
and pretty soon, you'll be wearing this vest.

117
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,750
Well, not this exact one.

118
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,460
There's a different style... For the ladies.

119
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,480
Just to be clear, I'm not hitting on you.

120
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,970
Okay.

121
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,830
There's my little worker bee.

122
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,910
Buzz, buzz.

123
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,420
Mom, what are you doing here?

124
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,870
Just wanted to come by and see my daughter

125
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,510
on her first day of work.

126
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,940
And while I'm here,

127
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,760
I picked up a couple of essentials.

128
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,210
Some Fiddle Faddle...

129
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,490
Videotapes for Adam, a clapper for dad so he can...

130
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,190
Turn the lights off from bed,

131
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,730
cologne for Pops...

132
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,390
And an athletic supporter and cup for Barry. Look at this.

133
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,220
I'm Darth Vader.

134
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,380
Erica, I am your mother.

135
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,600
Give me your discount.

136
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,860
Oh, but seriously,

137
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,860
give me your discount.

138
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,470
I've only been here an hour.

139
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,950
I'm not even sure how that works.

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,660
The discount policy extends to the employee's immediate family,

141
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,950
and that's me.

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,170
How do you even know that?

143
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,200
Well, I took a look-see

144
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,910
inside the employee lounge and checked out the handbook.

145
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,930
Fine. I'll give you my discount,

146
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,810
just as long as you stay out of the lounge.

147
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,680
Okay.

148
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,620
With the discount...

149
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,670
It comes to...

150
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,660
$17.10.

151
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,060
And... Damn it, I'm good.

152
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,710
Mom--

153
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,850
I'm so proud of us.

154
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,220
Yes! Yes! Move your ass! Move it!

155
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,720
Move it! That's it!

156
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,920
- Yes, yes! - No!

157
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,820
Son of a bitch!

158
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,430
Damn it!

159
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,650
The one day I wear a ketchup-colored shirt!

160
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,180
Come on. I got an idea.

161
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,560
Hey, Barry. Barry, wait up.

162
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,750
I lost three in a row, Pops. Can we just go?

163
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,510
Why would we go?

164
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,640
You didn't lose that race. You won.

165
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,130
- Really? - Really?

166
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,580
Really. When I placed your bet,

167
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,650
I also picked the trifecta,

168
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,500
then boxed the quinella,

169
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,500
and wheeled the exacta.

170
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,740
That means you win for coming in last.

171
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,120
That doesn't make any sense.

172
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,680
Of course it does. It's like in golf.

173
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,940
The person who gets the lowest score wins.

174
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,370
That does happen in golf!

175
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,880
You just won yourself 20 bucks.

176
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,890
Now that's Barry luck.

177
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,860
Chili dogs on me, baby!

178
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,080
Told you I had a plan.

179
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,770
Where's the snack bar?

180
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,310
While Pops was making Barry's life better,

181
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
over the next week,

182
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,240
my mom continued making Erica's a living hell.

183
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,490
This is the last outfit left in Adam's size,

184
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,180
so I'll just bring the mannequin back tomorrow.

185
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,500
Mom, this is the fourth time you've been here this week.

186
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,960
Actually, it's the fifth. I came in on your day off,

187
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,650
and Randy let me use his discount.

188
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,110
I don't wanna get in trouble.

189
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,720
Donald said I'm being considered for assistant manager.

190
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,720
Oh, my god. That would be amazing!

191
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,520
According to the handbook, you'd get another 10% off.

192
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,780
Mom, you're not listening.

193
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,110
And you're not making with the beep-bop-boop.

194
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,210
I'm sorry, honey. I've gotta speed this along.

195
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,420
I've got lunch plans.

196
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,920
You can't be back here.

197
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,780
It'll just take a minute.

198
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,360
You're messing with my drawer. I have a system!

199
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,160
Thanks, poopie.

200
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,850
- Yeah, we need to talk. - I know, I know.

201
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,170
Look, you've become a really special member

202
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,490
of the Gimbels family.

203
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,600
Technically, your mom is allowed to use your discount,

204
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,860
but in my heart, it just feels wrong.

205
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,950
- I get that. - You get that

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,100
if you don't get rid of her, I will fire you?

207
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,790
I didn't get that. But now I do.

208
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,500
Good. Make sure we get the mannequin back.

209
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,010
Erica knew someone had to go,

210
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,720
and it wasn't gonna be her.

211
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,230
So when my mom came in the next day, she was ready.

212
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,910
Here you go. Four snow pants, four parkas,

213
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,600
three sets of mittens, and of course, fiddle faddle.

214
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,310
And it practically all pays for itself

215
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,710
with my employee discount.

216
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,350
Have I told you that you're my favorite child?

217
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,140
I'm gonna say it at the dinner table tonight.

218
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,590
I literally love you the most.

219
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,850
Bye, sweetie.

220
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,840
Bye.

221
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,250
Sorry, ma'am. We're gonna need to go through your bags.

222
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,530
Oh. Of course.

223
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,920
You know, I come here all the time.

224
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,670
It's just standard procedure.

225
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,760
I honestly... Don't know how that got in there.

226
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,420
Can you come with me, please?

227
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,020
Why? I didn't take it.

228
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,520
I don't even wear white diamonds.

229
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,330
It's not my signature scent.

230
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,170
Come on.

231
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,270
Don't put your hands on me!

232
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,060
I have rights.

233
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,490
We don't need to make a scene.

234
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,030
Erica! Call Mr. Gimbel.

235
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,790
Tell him one of his best customers is in trouble

236
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,650
and needs his help.

237
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,300
I'd rather not get involved, ma'am.

238
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,210
You. I've been framed. She framed me with snow pants.

239
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,250
Oh! Please hold on to my merchandise

240
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,090
until I can get this sorted out!

241
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,950
Now that Barry's luck had changed,

242
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,290
he was sure it was contagious.

243
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,460
I'm on fire, baby!

244
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,550
That was all me. I scored that goal.

245
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,720
What are you talking about?

246
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,650
My awesome luck's going right through the tv

247
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,920
and into the Flyers.

248
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,150
That's true. Whenever something good happens,

249
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,820
we call it Barry luck.

250
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,210
Is that what you called it when he bit into his own hand

251
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,430
at dinner the other night?

252
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,930
That's old Barry.

253
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,370
You ate all the fiddle!

254
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,690
It's all faddle now, you moron.

255
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,280
Hey, kiddo. How was work?

256
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,310
Good. Good.

257
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,420
Another day, another dollar.

258
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,890
You.

259
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,990
You gave me no choice.

260
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
You were using me as a human discount.

261
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,180
Who has their own mother arrested? Who does that?

262
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,120
And to think I almost bought you snow pants?

263
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. All right, what's going on here?

264
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,430
Your own daughter had me hauled off to jail.

265
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,330
It was the mall security office next to the orange julius.

266
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,990
It was jail. It was small and stuffy,

267
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,130
and they took a very unflattering polaroid of me.

268
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,160
Look at it. Look at it.

269
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,650
Look at it.

270
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,100
Wait. Did you steal that?

271
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,810
You were there for stealing.

272
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,770
I was providing this family with the essential items

273
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,080
that make this household run,

274
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,550
like food, clothing, fiddle faddle.

275
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,520
That's what I do. Tell her, Murray.

276
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,320
He agrees with me. You framed the woman

277
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,250
who gave birth to you. Bravo.

278
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,730
Damn it!

279
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,880
Murray.

280
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,180
Go to your room while I figure out your punishment.

281
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm 17. You can't just send me to my room.

282
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,380
Oh, I can, and I will, and I just did.

283
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,400
It's my job as your mother.

284
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,110
Job? Please. You've never had a job a day in your life.

285
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,670
You're just a mom.

286
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,760
It had been three days

287
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,470
since Erica questioned my mom's entire reason for being,

288
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,170
so Beverly Goldberg did the only reasonable thing

289
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,380
she could think of.

290
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,710
She went on strike.

291
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,440
Hey, honey.

292
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,700
Uh, just talking with the boys,

293
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,030
and we were kind of wondering where we are

294
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,210
on tonight's dinner situation.

295
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,060
Ooh. I just made myself

296
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,590
a delicious piece of teriyaki salmon,

297
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,210
but, uh, oh, I think there's cold cuts in the fridge.

298
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,290
Look, Bevy,

299
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,090
I know you're trying to make a point here,

300
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,750
but it's been three days.

301
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,810
I had to wear my tuxedo shirt to work!

302
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,610
Yes, I did look like Roger Moore,

303
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,480
but don't you think it's time you called off this fight?

304
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,930
There's no fight. All that happened

305
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,920
was my daughter gently suggested that my life is meaningless.

306
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,610
Oh, here's our little angel now.

307
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,130
If you have a problem, you should take it up with her.

308
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,220
- What? - You know what.

309
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,760
You broke mom.

310
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,270
While my mom and Erica continued their battle,

311
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,840
my battle with "Zelda"

312
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,390
was about to come to a glorious end.

313
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,720
Okay. Don't touch anything in there.

314
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,350
I'm about to win "Zelda."

315
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,790
I gotta grab my video camera and record this moment.

316
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,570
'Cause it's literally the biggest day of my life.

317
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,580
Well, who's Zelda? Your--your girlfriend?

318
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,070
No. It's the game I've been playing for the last six months.

319
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,450
It's all I talk about. Were you even listening?

320
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,110
I think you answered your own question there.

321
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,050
Don't let anyone near the tv!

322
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,610
Oh, my god, it's happening!

323
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,660
Dad. You won't believe the day I had.

324
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,010
First I aced my math quiz. "b"-minus.

325
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,140
Then bio lab got flooded,

326
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,330
so we had class in the quad,

327
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,530
where a bird did not crap on me.

328
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,280
Then after school,

329
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,080
Jen Sperling asked me to the dance

330
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,600
'Cause her date got...

331
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,870
viral meningitis.

332
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,210
Oh, good for you. Bad for him. But good for you.

333
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,900
His brain is swollen! Everything's coming up Barry.

334
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,880
Barry was on a lucky streak, and I was gonna pay the price.

335
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,000
I was one button click away

336
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,780
from winning "the legend of Zelda."

337
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,600
Unfortunately, I wasn't the one

338
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,160
who got to click the button.

339
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,970
See that?

340
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,090
I literally can't lose.

341
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,170
No, no! No!

342
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,710
What did you do?!

343
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,000
You stupid, stupid man.

344
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,860
Dude! What's your problem?

345
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,930
I've been playing that game for six months!

346
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,610
And I beat it in six seconds.

347
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,440
Guess that's just Barry luck.

348
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,730
You're not lucky. You didn't win a single race at the track.

349
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,780
I won the exacta! You just don't understand golf.

350
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,800
You don't understand anything.

351
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,640
No one wins for coming in last.

352
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,850
Pops made it all up.

353
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,270
What?

354
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,540
Pops would never screw with me like that. Tell him.

355
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,600
You can win tons of money for coming in last.

356
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,180
That's right! And one day, you'll ride a unicorn,

357
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,810
and you'll live in a house made of candy.

358
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,460
Just to be clear-- you won't.

359
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,370
And just like that, Barry's lucky streak ended.

360
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,650
You okay?

361
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,710
Yeah. I...

362
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,190
Finally made enough money

363
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,260
to buy the dress I wanted at work,

364
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,700
and apparently, taffeta melts.

365
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,670
Apologize to your mom.

366
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,520
Dad...

367
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,660
Not just for you, but for me, too.

368
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,520
There's no food in the house. Today I had to eat an apple.

369
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,460
I'm not gonna apologize to mom because you had to eat fruit.

370
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,790
I know your mom gets carried away,

371
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,730
but everything she does, she does for this family.

372
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,930
It's her job.

373
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,870
And she doesn't get any employee discounts,

374
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,070
and all her customers-- jerks! Every one of 'em.

375
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,070
You may not wanna do what your mom does

376
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,280
when you grow up,

377
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,520
but you gotta learn to respect it.

378
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,860
After learning Pops had tricked him,

379
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,740
bad luck Barry set out to get his revenge.

380
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,130
Thanks for agreeing to bring me back here, Pops.

381
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,300
I'm on such a lucky streak, figured I'd let it ride.

382
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,090
Well, what'll it be, kiddo?

383
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,770
There are some great odds on Semi-charmed.

384
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,790
No. I'm gonna bet Colonel Seymour.

385
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,090
Colonel Seymour?

386
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,770
He's 40 to 1.

387
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,010
You could jump on my back, and we'd beat him.

388
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,170
Well, with Barry luck, I can't lose,

389
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,600
'Cause I'm Barry and I'm lucky.

390
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,100
Right? Right?

391
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,810
Here's all the money to my name--

392
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,500
Birthdays, allowance,

393
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,790
money I stole from Adam-- bet it all.

394
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,070
I don't think you should make this bet, kid.

395
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,340
Why not? I mean, you told me I'm lucky,

396
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,730
and it's not like my grandfather

397
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,780
would lie to my face for a week straight.

398
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,820
Right?

399
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,940
Right?

400
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,700
So I'm guessing you know.

401
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,380
Yeah, I know! Adam told me everything.

402
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,090
I'm a completely jinx, and you know it.

403
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,760
Kiddo, you just had the week of your life,

404
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,620
and you know why?

405
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,960
'Cause you were thinking positive for a change.

406
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,430
Yeah, 'cause thinking positive got me a hot date,

407
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,550
good grades, and stopped my night terrors.

408
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,200
Yes! Look, there's no such thing as luck.

409
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,380
It's all about betting on yourself.

410
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,890
That's when things really change.

411
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,350
Guess it was a good week.

412
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,450
So, uh, you're still gonna bet

413
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,020
on this crazy long shot Colonel Seymour?

414
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,190
Nah. I think I'm gonna sit this one out.

415
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,060
And the winner is Colonel Seymour

416
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,960
by half a length.

417
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,980
Pops, how much would I have won?

418
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,490
Somewhere in the neighborhood of $4,253.

419
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,590
What are you doing out here?

420
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Had to get out of that stinky house.

421
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,670
It smells like a diaper fire.

422
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,520
These are comfortable.

423
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,130
It's comfort spring technology.

424
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,810
Look, I was pissed. I shouldn't have said all that.

425
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,260
I know what you do is a job.

426
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,100
You know, when I was younger, I was really good in school.

427
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,970
I got straight A's. I was a real good arguer,

428
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,830
and people used to say,

429
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,840
"Beverly Solomon, you should be a lawyer."

430
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,750
That wasn't my dream.

431
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,050
My dream was to have a family.

432
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,740
My dream was this.

433
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,070
You're really good at it.

434
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,060
But it's not for everyone.

435
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,580
You want different things out of life,

436
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,000
and... That's okay.

437
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,230
You sure?

438
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,030
Honey, you are a pain in my ass,

439
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,400
and you never listen to a word I say,

440
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,080
but the way you had me booted out of that store...

441
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,140
You're gonna make a great assistant manager one day.

442
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,330
I'm sorry I got you sent to mall jail.

443
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,960
I'm sorry I got carried away with your discount.

444
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,190
I know I get crazy when it comes to shopping.

445
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,330
I will try to work on that.

446
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,070
- No, you won't. - I really won't.

447
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,700
Listen, I need your help.

448
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,790
I kinda ironed my dress.

449
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,020
Honey, you don't iron taffeta.

450
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,820
It's okay. Mama will fix it.

451
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,790
Here you go, sweetie. Made your lunch.

452
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,290
Have a good day at work.

453
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,620
You, too.

454
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,330
Yeah, in my family, we yelled and swore

455
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,750
and sometimes framed each other for petty crimes,

456
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,520
but under all that crazy,

457
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,940
we were always there to support each other.

458
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,000
"Zelda II"?! Seriously?!

459
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,680
I saved some money at the track. Come on.

460
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,990
Let's go play.

461
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,920
Aw, look at my delicious little boy!

462
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,260
Lucky guy.

463
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,010
She looks amazing.

464
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,450
How'd you fix her dress?

465
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,490
Easy. I just bought her a new one.

466
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,420
And every now and then, we even made each other's lives

467
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,120
just a little bit easier.

468
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,330
What is this?

469
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,740
Figured it was our turn to make you dinner.

470
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,840
Oh, my gosh. That is so sweet!

471
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,170
So exciting.

472
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,170
Tough on the top and has a jelly coating on the bottom.

473
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,930
Is that baking soda?

474
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,710
Why don't I just whip something up?

475
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,410
- Thank god. - Perfect.

476
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,260
I love you guys.

477
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,860
Look what I swiped from the security office at work.

478
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,930
You can't detain me! I have rights!

479
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,360
I almost went to law school.

480
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,930
I am a female woman, and I am being held against my will.

481
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,690
Nobody knows

482
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,790
the trouble I've seen

483
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,940
This prison can't hold me!

484
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,540
Let me out!

485
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,080
You may have caged my body,

486
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,910
but you have not caged my mind!

487
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,900
Do you think this is funny?

488
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,810
I know what you're doing back there.

489
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,590
I can see you!

490
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,750
You will not break my spirit.

491
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,280
How long was she in there?

492
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,060
12 minutes.

494
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,990
Please don't do that now.

495
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,260
Don't do that.

496
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,950
That's a nice sweater. Where'd you get that?
