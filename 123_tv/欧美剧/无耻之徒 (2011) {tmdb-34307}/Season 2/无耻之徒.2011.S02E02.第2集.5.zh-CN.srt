1
00:00:01,496 --> 00:00:03,630
I was here last week.

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:04,965
Where the fuck were you?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,082
I recently experienced

4
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:07,167
a tragedy.

5
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:08,335
I lost the love of my life.

6
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:09,553
She's dead, Frank.

7
00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:11,288
She was my soul mate.

8
00:00:11,323 --> 00:00:13,089
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to find and train

9
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:14,474
a new assistant manager.

10
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:15,809
- Do we need one? - You should do it.

11
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:17,260
You'd be great at it.

12
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:19,296
- Can I come over tonight? - I'm busy.

13
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:21,648
- Did you fuck her? - What?

14
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:23,900
Did you fuck her?

15
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:25,101
Shit, stop!

16
00:00:25,153 --> 00:00:26,353
Stay away from her!

17
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:27,187
You stay the fuck away from her!

18
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,822
From who, my mom?

19
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:32,976
That's my sleepover.

20
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:34,578
This is Nick.

21
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:35,912
Holy shit.

22
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:37,314
He's been in juvie since he was nine.

23
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:38,698
- How old is he? - Eighteen.

24
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,367
Had to let him out 'cause of his birthday.

25
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:41,651
He's my brother from another mother.

26
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:42,836
You feel? We're tight.

27
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,487
You need to pick up the pace a bit.

28
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:45,839
Nobody's waiting. It's not a big deal.

29
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:47,657
I've seen trees grow faster

30
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:49,826
than he's bussing that table.

31
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:54,998
Oh, shit.

32
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:58,051
You're not pregnant?

33
00:00:58,103 --> 00:00:59,352
I'm not.

34
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:02,138
We're Derek's parents.

35
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,556
We'd like to talk to you about the baby.

36
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:04,674
What baby?

37
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,076
Derek and Debbie's baby.

38
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,819
It's too early for thinking.

39
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,191
Debbie's got to get an abortion.

40
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,245
Been hashing over this all night.

41
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,249
You need a break.

42
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:48,751
How could I have let this happen to her?

43
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:50,920
You didn't.

44
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:52,288
Whenever a girl gets pregnant,

45
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,757
the first thing people think is bad parenting.

46
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:58,094
Uh, you're an excellent sister/parent.

47
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:00,129
I should have made her go on the pill.

48
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,682
Do you want to, maybe, uh...

49
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:05,301
do your taxes while we're at it?

50
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,203
Sorry.

51
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:09,388
I'm not really in the mood.

52
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:11,474
Hmm.

53
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:12,942
Seems like you are to me.

54
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:14,727
If she has this baby,

55
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,446
she's gonna be like every other sad ass girl

56
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,814
- in this fucking neighb-- - Okay.

57
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:20,516
You know, you got to shut up for a few minutes.

58
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:23,202
You need a stress reliever and I only have 12 minutes

59
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:24,370
before my meeting.

60
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:25,738
So this is what's gonna happen.

61
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,374
You're gonna shut off your brain.

62
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,877
And you're gonna...

63
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:32,995
breathe into your body.

64
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,130
I can't breathe.

65
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:34,964
Your hand is on my--

66
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,582
Yeah, I said shut up.

67
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:39,135
Breathe through your nose.

68
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:43,172
You feel me inside of you?

69
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:46,242
Yeah.

70
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:47,643
Relax. Close your eyes.

71
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:51,063
Yeah, let me do all the work.

72
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,269
Now just let go,

73
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,937
and give yourself over to me.

74
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:00,957
That's it.

75
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:01,858
Do it. Good girl.

76
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,591
Nice job.

77
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:25,515
Now I got to blue ball it over to my meeting before work.

78
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,551
I'm gonna rally this family to make Debbie do it.

79
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:31,270
Well, take it easy on her. You know how it is.

80
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:35,057
You tell a teenager what to do, they always do the opposite.

81
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,893
Ugh.

82
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,694
Okay.

83
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,696
Hey, there's a nurse coming over to the diner today

84
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:42,315
to give you your drug test.

85
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,649
Why?

86
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:44,867
Insurance.

87
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:46,536
You have a felony drug conviction

88
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:50,373
and you're handling money now.

89
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:53,042
See ya at the grind, Sparky.

90
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,670
Ooh, hello, Charise.

91
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,025
You too, Tamika.

92
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:13,262
Lovely to make your acquaintance,

93
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,015
Kymberly with two Ys.

94
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:20,152
Hey, buddy,

95
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:21,988
time to get up.

96
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:24,023
Gotta do our rounds before school.

97
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,441
- Huh? - Not you.

98
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:26,359
Go back to sleep.

99
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:31,581
You don't need to sleep with that hammer no more.

100
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:34,333
No one's gonna try to ass rape you in my crib.

101
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,451
Got your back.

102
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:36,452
Okay?

103
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,544
You're the best tennis players on the planet.

104
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:48,631
Gemma, you have the number one backhand smash

105
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:49,498
in the world.

106
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:51,434
Amy,

107
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:53,686
you can serve and volley

108
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,721
like no one's business.

109
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,390
- Gemma... - Kev...

110
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,108
I'm thinking the subliminal message thing

111
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:00,393
- is really working. - Gemma...

112
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:02,194
Well, at least it put 'em to sleep.

113
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,196
...gave you the nickname "The Sledgehammer."

114
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:06,232
What, you saying my voice is boring?

115
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:08,818
No, I'm saying we got 30 minutes to get down to business

116
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,820
while Venus and Serena finally take a nap.

117
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,154
Oh, yes. Let's do this.

118
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,706
You get a tattoo

119
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,325
of a sledgehammer on your right bicep.

120
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,460
- Mm. - Your dad's

121
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:19,328
a little disappointed by this,

122
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,529
but he can overlook it.

123
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:21,697
- Babe? - Hmm?

124
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:23,049
As much as I love

125
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:24,133
hearing your subliminal message voice,

126
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:25,801
can we take this upstairs?

127
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:26,919
Really? 'Cause it's kinda turning me on.

128
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:28,337
Uh-huh.

129
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,722
- Ooh. - Come on.

130
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:30,890
Get away

131
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,258
from my babies

132
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,227
before I blow your heads off!

133
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,062
You should've put muzzles on them!

134
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:39,565
Damn it! Yanis woke up the girls again.

135
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,734
All right, I'll go deal with it.

136
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,119
God damn it, Yanis!

137
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:48,908
Aw, come on. You can't take them.

138
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:50,359
They-- those are my babies!

139
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,995
We asked you to make them stop barking.

140
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:54,613
They're dogs.

141
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,083
They bark. That's what they fucking do!

142
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:58,501
Yanis!

143
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:00,202
Shut up!

144
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,921
My babies haven't napped in over a week

145
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,839
because of your loud mouth.

146
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,591
Now, what is going on?

147
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,610
These two rug-chomping dykebats

148
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:09,845
called Animal Services on my babies!

149
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:10,880
All right-- all right!

150
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:12,264
Would you just calm down,

151
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,884
and tell me the story without the gay bashing.

152
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:18,387
Look, man, I've had Michael, Tito, LaToya, Marlon, and Janet

153
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,488
since they were eight weeks old.

154
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,639
They're not licensed.

155
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:21,957
I don't know what that even--

156
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,275
Lisa and Lisa, what is going on?

157
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:25,111
There's feces everywhere, Kevin.

158
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:26,612
- So? - One of them is foaming

159
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,647
at the mouth. They could bite our kids.

160
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,199
Give them rabies.

161
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:32,118
Kids? I didn't know you guys had kids.

162
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:33,402
Not yet.

163
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,454
But soon.

164
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,655
Hey Tito.

165
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,990
Daddy's gonna get you outta there.

166
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,075
I need you to back away from the van, sir.

167
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:40,326
- Would y-- - Wh-wh-wh-

168
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:41,660
What're you gonna do with the dogs?

169
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:42,795
I'ma bring 'em down to the shelter.

170
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,879
Owner has seven days to get permits

171
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:45,147
and provide a clean living area

172
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:46,665
and pay for microchips and vaccinations.

173
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:48,417
Otherwise, they become candidates for adoption

174
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,919
or euthanasia.

175
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,754
You can't kill my dogs, motherfucker.

176
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:53,389
Hey, get the fuck off me. Don't make me fucking tase you!

177
00:07:53,424 --> 00:07:54,924
All right-- all right-- all right! Okay.

178
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,675
Yanis, you're gonna get your ass thrown in jail.

179
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:57,643
- He - You heard the guy.

180
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,178
You can get your dogs back.

181
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,147
Go start by cleaning up the mounds of shit

182
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:02,431
in the front yard. Go!

183
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:08,471
Can you just go do it quietly?

184
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,443
Oh...

185
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,578
Thank you, Kevin.

186
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,867
Just remember, Lisa and other Lisa,

187
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,419
we were doing fine in this neighborhood

188
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:25,171
before you two moved in.

189
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,324
Get outta my shit.

190
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,994
I'm taking 'em.

191
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:07,296
I need your help convincing Debbie to get an abortion.

192
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:09,748
- Sleeping. - Can we talk about it later?

193
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:12,134
Fine.

194
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,636
See you at work.

195
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:15,004
Can't wait.

196
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:22,394
Go sleep in your room, Frank.

197
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,230
I can't.

198
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:27,149
I just can't.

199
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:29,268
It's the last place in the United States

200
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,070
I spent with Bianca.

201
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:33,656
I-- sick of hearing about your dead girlfriend.

202
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,491
My--

203
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:36,692
What?

204
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:37,910
What's the ma--

205
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,361
What's the matter with you?

206
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,280
How could you say something like--

207
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:43,165
What's the matter?

208
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:45,501
How dare you blaspheme

209
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:47,253
the name of Bianca.

210
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:49,455
How dare you!

211
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:52,374
Good, God, Fiona. Jesus!

212
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,795
Good morning.

213
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:04,553
"Good morning to you too, Fiona."

214
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,058
Friend Nick is still here, huh?

215
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,476
Yup.

216
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:13,946
How long you planning on staying, Nick?

217
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,397
A while.

218
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,817
You don't have a place to go?

219
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,288
No family.

220
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,492
Does he talk?

221
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,177
I got him covered.

222
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:34,750
- So, uh, hey, Debbie? - Yeah?

223
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:37,052
- I just called the clinic. - So?

224
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:39,421
I made an appointment for you for Friday.

225
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,973
For an abortion.

226
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:42,258
They want us there this afternoon

227
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,342
for your pre-screening.

228
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:44,843
I'll pick you up after school.

229
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:48,814
Not part of my plan.

230
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,016
But now that Derek's gone,

231
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,151
- it's gonna-- - He's coming back.

232
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:54,603
His parents are assholes.

233
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,905
Did you talk to him?

234
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,073
We love each other.

235
00:10:58,109 --> 00:10:59,325
Debs, come on.

236
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,826
- You're 15. - Yeah?

237
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,411
Please, you're always bragging

238
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:04,280
about how you had to raise us when you were 16.

239
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:06,081
Bragging? It was forced on me.

240
00:11:06,117 --> 00:11:07,082
I didn't have a choice.

241
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:08,417
You have a choice.

242
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,836
Yeah, and I choose to have a baby.

243
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,755
You have your whole life ahead of you.

244
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,790
And I don't have my whole life ahead of me if I have a baby?

245
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,209
You can have a baby when you're older

246
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,795
and finished high school and college and gotten a job.

247
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,513
Right, so I should just stop being pregnant, then?

248
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:23,432
- Yes. - I'm not killing my baby.

249
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:26,969
It's not a baby. It's a few cells.

250
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,855
Does this look like a few cells?

251
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:35,861
The website says my baby's the size of an orange right now.

252
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,480
Totally looks like you just fucked a tadpole.

253
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,016
Debbie, be realistic.

254
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:43,535
How are you gonna go to school and have a baby?

255
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:45,404
You want me to be realistic?

256
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,889
Okay, I'll be realistic.

257
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:47,873
Knives are in the drawer

258
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,024
if you wanna do a home abortion.

259
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,409
Carl!

260
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,628
Leaving.

261
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:54,713
Here's a couple hundies for her abortion

262
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:55,714
and Nick's room and board.

263
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,832
Where'd you get this?

264
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,300
Earned it.

265
00:11:58,336 --> 00:12:00,052
How?

266
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,503
Let's go, Nick.

267
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,255
I'm taking this bag of flour with me.

268
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,556
Why?

269
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:06,342
To prove to you that I can go to school

270
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:09,645
and take care of a baby at the same time.

271
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,597
A bag of flour.

272
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:24,777
Are we cool with everything that happened?

273
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,278
You're asking me that right now?

274
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,916
Yeah, I mean, are we?

275
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,418
I'm having sex with you, aren't I?

276
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:37,589
- Talk dirty to me. - Okay, um...

277
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,375
I'm gonna slap you with my big dick

278
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:41,210
and come all over your face.

279
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,612
Jesus, maybe not that dirty.

280
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,383
Never mind, never mind.

281
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:48,767
- I'm gonna come anyway. - All right.

282
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:53,722
- Ah. - Fuck.

283
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:03,365
Sorry, it was, uh...

284
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:05,901
It was weird with Theo in the shower.

285
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,573
Then you should kill him.

286
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,542
A gun or a pipe?

287
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:14,943
Dealer's choice.

288
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:17,129
You have a good life insurance policy?

289
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,464
Cool mil.

290
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:21,383
Wow.

291
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:24,620
Make it look like an accident, though, okay?

292
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,735
You are joking, right?

293
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,187
Am I?

294
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,689
Maybe...

295
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,690
Maybe not.

296
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:46,909
It's all yours, doll face.

297
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:48,243
You too, Helene.

298
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,246
I gotta get ready for work.

299
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:53,949
Will you start a pot of coffee, please, lover?

300
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,167
Yeah.

301
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:04,593
Hey, yo, you stay out front

302
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:06,095
while I go in and offer Mr. Wu

303
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,263
a little neighborhood protection policy.

304
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:10,883
Give you the signal if I need you, a'ight?

305
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,156
See you next Thursday, Mr. Wu.

306
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,326
Like taking candy from an Asian dry cleaner.

307
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:40,078
Used appliance store next, before school?

308
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:42,998
You're gonna carry a bag of flour around all day?

309
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,500
If that's what it takes

310
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:46,135
to prove to Fiona that I'm my own person, yes.

311
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,553
Well, good luck with that.

312
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:49,371
She's a total control freak lately.

313
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:50,672
Tell me about it.

314
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,107
Acting like she's our mom.

315
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:53,759
It's my body. I can do what I want.

316
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:54,893
Yeah.

317
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:56,562
I'm getting it from all sides.

318
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:58,480
Here she's jamming meds down my throat,

319
00:14:58,516 --> 00:15:00,933
and at work, she's ripping me a new one over some bullshit.

320
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,152
Found 'em.

321
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:04,269
Baby clothes?

322
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,604
Gotta dress Desiree, don't I?

323
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:13,395
Look what she's sending me.

324
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,498
Delete that shit.

325
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:22,671
Mm, look at Miss Thang in real clothes.

326
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:24,957
Oh, yeah, if you call Goodwill real clothes.

327
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:27,926
Least you're not schlepping burgers in a tron uniform.

328
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:29,678
I'm gonna miss the tips.

329
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:32,764
You can have the $1.50 I got from Mr. Asswater.

330
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,932
I mean, Atwater.

331
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:35,350
- Hey, Olga? - Yep.

332
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:36,802
Did you ever try to talk your daughter

333
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:37,936
into having an abortion?

334
00:15:37,972 --> 00:15:39,304
Didn't get a chance.

335
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,139
She hid her pregnancy from me for six months.

336
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:42,941
Yeah, my kid sister was trying to do that to me.

337
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:44,610
- Debbie's pregnant? - Yes.

338
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:45,694
That sucks.

339
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:47,145
Adam, fry up this tissue

340
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:48,597
with table 37's order of hash browns.

341
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:49,815
Guy's running my ass ragged.

342
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,316
- Sure. - You guys,

343
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,785
we shouldn't be frying up tissues anymore, okay?

344
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:54,903
What about a shoelace?

345
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,371
Let's not fry anything.

346
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:57,823
Not even the chicken strips?

347
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,708
Of course the chi-- you know what I mean.

348
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,792
I don't think we do.

349
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:01,793
Maybe you should explain it

350
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:02,878
to those of us not smart enough

351
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:04,379
to become the assistant manager.

352
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:05,781
I don't need your shit today, Melinda.

353
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:07,449
Let me know when you do need it.

354
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:10,052
You used to ask Adam to fry up tissues, Fiona.

355
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:11,970
Yeah, and now I'm trying to be responsible,

356
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:13,972
so cut me some slack.

357
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:17,009
Not gonna happen. You're management now.

358
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,928
Hey, how'd it go with Debbie?

359
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,181
Bad. She thinks Derek's coming back.

360
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:24,700
- Is he? - Hell no.

361
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,351
How was your meeting?

362
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,204
Well, me and my blue balls had a good time.

363
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,656
- Sorry. - That's all right.

364
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:33,992
I jacked off behind the podium while I was sharing.

365
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:35,944
Am I a horrible person 'cause I secretly hope

366
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,196
Debbie has a miscarriage?

367
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:41,083
It's not a secret anymore, but it's understandable.

368
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:44,002
Mr. Sean, can I have Sunday off for my daughter's baptism?

369
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:45,871
Ask Fiona. She does the schedule now.

370
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,623
In fact, that goes for everyone.

371
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:53,528
Fiona's setting the schedule around here from now on.

372
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:54,630
Yes, Melinda.

373
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:56,131
That is exactly what it looks like

374
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,382
when I'm doing it.

375
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:07,225
Yo.

376
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,313
Listen, I'm-- I'm sorry about the, uh...

377
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,731
What? Broken knuckle

378
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,200
'cause you thought I was fucking my mother?

379
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,902
Yeah, no I didn't exactly think you-- you were fuck--

380
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,704
Good morning.

381
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:21,707
I'm fucking my father, actually.

382
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:22,991
Bye, Daddy.

383
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,660
See ya, son.

384
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:38,473
Want some eggs?

385
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:40,942
Uh, no. No.

386
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,011
Just coffee, thanks.

387
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,100
Actually, I should probably go too.

388
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:51,603
You had me worried there the other day.

389
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,322
You thought Helene was sleeping with Dylan?

390
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:54,773
Right.

391
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:57,409
Yeah, about that. I'm-- I'm sorry.

392
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:02,948
You do understand that the only reason

393
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,618
you're having sex with my wife is because I allow it, right?

394
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,923
Yeah.

395
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,709
Yeah, no, I got that.

396
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:16,178
Um...

397
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:18,180
I'm gonna go now.

398
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:19,431
Have a good day.

399
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,216
Yeah...

400
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:32,477
I wish I could invent a machine

401
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,147
that would just erase her memory from my brain.

402
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,898
You know, some people say that the sativa

403
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,102
is a memory-erasing machine, Frankie.

404
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:42,871
I know that's funny, Gar.

405
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:45,240
I'm just not in a laughing mood right now.

406
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,125
Hey, free beer to anyone who helps us

407
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:48,877
bring the rest of the stuff in.

408
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:51,046
Why the hell should we work for free beer

409
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:53,382
when these hipster jack wipes are buying it for us

410
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:54,750
just for treating 'em like shit?

411
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:56,668
Another beer for my pal Tommy.

412
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,220
Thanks, asswipe.

413
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:00,222
Hey, what is going on with the smoke, Svet?

414
00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:02,674
Place is like a hotbox. They can't light up in here.

415
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,509
They pay $12 for espresso,

416
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,845
they could smoke my balls if they want.

417
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,865
Twelve bucks? Toke it up, folks!

418
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,850
You don't really have balls, do you?

419
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,735
Let me give you a little advice my shaman gave me

420
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:15,654
when my grandpa died.

421
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,573
You have any of Bianca's things?

422
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:20,492
You kidding? I got a whole shrine.

423
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:24,980
A hairbrush, underwear, bra, bikini, lab coat,

424
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:27,582
shells, photographs, little jewelry box that I put--

425
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:29,251
Burn it all.

426
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:31,920
What?

427
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:33,705
Bring it to the hospital where you first met her.

428
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,540
Light it on fire.

429
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,460
Guaranteed to help you find closure.

430
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,528
Seriously?

431
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:40,929
Trust me.

432
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:43,765
You are too fine a man to hurt like this.

433
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,167
Be free, little Frankie.

434
00:19:45,202 --> 00:19:46,551
Be free.

435
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,856
Holy fuck.

436
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:52,474
You're right.

437
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,226
I'm gonna do it. Right now.

438
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:55,210
Hey!

439
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:57,229
Take my lighter, amigo.

440
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:01,316
You're a good egg, Gar.

441
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,587
Burn, baby, burn.

442
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,825
Where'd we get an espresso machine?

443
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,294
Uh, Carl and big scary colored man,

444
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:14,412
they steal from fancy coffee place.

445
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:17,799
Svet, you do remember that my wife is black, right?

446
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:19,217
So?

447
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,587
Aah!

448
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,723
Shit!

449
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:41,857
What?

450
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,992
Mind giving up your seat for me and my baby?

451
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,331
It's a bag of flour.

452
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:51,750
Dude, get up. She's obviously retarded.

453
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,586
- Her or the baby? - Just get up.

454
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,074
Thank you.

455
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:14,867
_

456
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:21,363
Hey, this is Derek. Leave a message after the beep.

457
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:22,981
Thanks.

458
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,866
Hey, it's me, again.

459
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:27,869
Uh, call me back when your stupid parents aren't around.

460
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:29,070
Miss you.

461
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,906
Bye.

462
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,837
Yo, there's Charleston.

463
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,339
Come on.

464
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:50,508
Yo, Mr. Charleston.

465
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,594
Hey, Charleston, wait up.

466
00:21:54,264 --> 00:21:56,514
- Yeah? - Yo.

467
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,517
Think you could take my backpack into school for me?

468
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,436
Why? What's in it?

469
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,854
Here's the thing.

470
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:05,240
Could either tell you...

471
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:07,192
could not tell you.

472
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,327
Not tell me.

473
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:12,163
Meet me at your janitor's closet in ten minutes.

474
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,615
You better make it 15.

475
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:14,916
I'ma stop at the cafeteria

476
00:22:14,952 --> 00:22:16,418
and pick me up a couple Milky Ways

477
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:18,253
with this Benjamin.

478
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:28,713
Oh.

479
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,131
It's the leg.

480
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,232
Yeah, all right.

481
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,686
A'ight, we're in. Let's go.

482
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,942
Yeah.

483
00:22:40,978 --> 00:22:42,777
This is it.

484
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:45,196
You're home, honey.

485
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,187
- Excuse me? - Oh, jeez.

486
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:53,955
Uh, this won't take but one minute.

487
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:55,373
What are you doing?

488
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:58,293
Uh, I just need to light all this stuff on fire.

489
00:22:58,328 --> 00:22:59,911
Are you nuts?

490
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,248
I need security at bed four ASAP.

491
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,134
- Man with a bomb. - This isn't a bomb.

492
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:07,969
It's Bianca's stuff.

493
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:10,472
Unless Bianca had a bomb in her stuff.

494
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:11,906
Bianca? Bianca Samson?

495
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:13,308
Mm-hmm.

496
00:23:13,343 --> 00:23:15,060
- Are you Frank? - Mm-hmm.

497
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,096
Put the lighter down now, jackass.

498
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,565
I'm not trying to hurt anybody.

499
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,350
I'm just--

500
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,686
I'm just trying to erase her memory.

501
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,287
It's okay, Lenny. I got this.

502
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,822
Are you sure, Dr. Joung?

503
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:29,824
Yes, this is Bianca's friend Frank.

504
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:33,294
You know about me?

505
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:38,950
Where are you, Ian?

506
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,785
This is your sister and your boss.

507
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,587
It's after 11:00 and you're supposed to be at work.

508
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,172
Get your ass in here.

509
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:50,628
Hey, don't be sticking that in my chicken.

510
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:51,796
It's part of my job now.

511
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,181
That's a work of art.

512
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:54,683
And this work of art is undercooked.

513
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:55,884
It needs more fire.

514
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,769
Or it needs to be served to my customer

515
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,020
'cause it's already ten minutes late.

516
00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:01,106
Who ordered the salmonella?

517
00:24:01,141 --> 00:24:03,141
- Hey, I'm off to a meeting. - Another one?

518
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,143
We're in the middle of a lunch rush.

519
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,445
You got this.

520
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:09,314
You're late, dude.

521
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:13,068
- Hey. - He's gonna fire your ass

522
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,269
if you keep showing up late.

523
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:15,820
I was helping out Debbie.

524
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,955
Well, good. Did you tell her

525
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,456
that she can't have a baby?

526
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:20,241
- No. - Why not?

527
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,327
- It's not my business. - Of course it is.

528
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,945
We can't afford another kid.

529
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,081
More water on 23 and a couple forks at 15, Ian.

530
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,466
- I got it. - She's gonna ruin her life.

531
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:29,751
- You don't know that. - Yeah, I--

532
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,653
We need to be a united family front, Ian.

533
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:34,889
You can't tell somebody what to do with their body, Fiona.

534
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:39,728
Hey.

535
00:24:39,763 --> 00:24:41,312
Just met with my buddy,

536
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:43,732
Kirk Freund, over at Chapman Energy Systems.

537
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:45,483
Oh, yeah?

538
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,153
Got you an internship with him for next summer.

539
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:49,938
Yeah, I'm not really an internship guy.

540
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,573
Hey-- hey, did you convince Debs to go?

541
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:53,024
No, she won't listen to me,

542
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,310
and Ian is no help. I'm freaking out.

543
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:57,662
You're gonna be on the geothermal research team.

544
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:59,514
Uh, no. I-I-I don't work for free.

545
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:00,832
Hey, do you, uh, do you want me to try?

546
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:01,916
Yeah, would you?

547
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,551
You're doing this internship.

548
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:04,669
Can-- can you get a car and--

549
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:06,321
and pick her up after school?

550
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:07,956
We gotta get her in for a pre-exam today.

551
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:10,208
- Sure. - You pay your dues now,

552
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,093
the contacts you make will pay off later.

553
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:13,461
I gotta get back to work.

554
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,630
Right, all right. Bye.

555
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:16,881
When I was your age,

556
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,883
I paid someone to work at their company.

557
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:22,437
Yeah-- hey, do you mind if I borrow your car?

558
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:24,806
- What am I, Yuber? - No, it-it-it's Uber.

559
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,307
I-I'll have it back in a few hours.

560
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,776
That car is my baby.

561
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:29,360
No, I-I-I know. It's an emergency.

562
00:25:29,396 --> 00:25:30,779
I will be very careful.

563
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:32,814
We're not really friends.

564
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:33,948
I wake you up every morning.

565
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:35,316
I'd feel better lending it

566
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,619
to a Chapman Energy Systems intern.

567
00:25:37,654 --> 00:25:38,953
Fine.

568
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:39,904
Yeah, I-I-I'll take the meeting

569
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:40,872
with the Kirk energy guy.

570
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:42,040
Now, where are your keys?

571
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:43,057
Probably left 'em in the car.

572
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:45,910
Right. Thank you.

573
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,731
Mr. Sullivan?

574
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:07,732
Yes, Deborah?

575
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,819
I need to go change my baby.

576
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:11,753
What?

577
00:26:11,788 --> 00:26:13,655
She's wet.

578
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,242
You realize that's a bag of flour in a dress, right?

579
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:18,693
Oh, duh.

580
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,112
I'm practicing for when I have my real baby.

581
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,364
Well, just because you got yourself knocked up

582
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,333
doesn't mean you should have special privileges over

583
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:28,786
the other students who managed to keep it in their pants.

584
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,258
Fine, go.

585
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:35,543
My imaginary friend needs to drop a deuce.

586
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,445
Can I be excused?

587
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,047
Sit down. Shut up.

588
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,691
V, this ladder is for shit.

589
00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:51,776
I need you to get off the phone and hold the ladder, please.

590
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:52,727
I am.

591
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:53,645
Fiona's spinning out

592
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:55,196
about Debbie being pregnant.

593
00:26:55,232 --> 00:26:56,314
Wants me to bring he r an Ativan.

594
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,398
Yeah, well, I'm spinning out

595
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,449
about Debbie being pregnant too.

596
00:26:58,485 --> 00:26:59,484
Do you know in a couple years

597
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:00,818
that could be Gemma or Amy?

598
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,237
Not with the chastity belts

599
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,988
we're gonna put over their vaginas.

600
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,823
Hipster maggots drunk last

601
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,243
of the IPA shit water beer.

602
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,328
All right, I'll go get more when I'm done.

603
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,163
Coming down, V.

604
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:17,785
All right, folks. That should do it.

605
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,974
You want to know why so many douchebag with top knot hair

606
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,260
that smell like farm animal come into our bar?

607
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,263
Not that we're complaining.

608
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,184
"Alibi voted Best Shittiest Bar on the South Side."

609
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:34,602
No shit.

610
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,604
It also says that we have the skankiest

611
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,106
and meanest Russian bartender.

612
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:42,777
Wow.

613
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,345
Best Shittiest Bar.

614
00:27:44,381 --> 00:27:46,080
Yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about that.

615
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:47,916
Yeah, I know, me either.

616
00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:50,118
I've never been the best at anything.

617
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:00,461
Sorry, forgot my wallet.

618
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:03,014
It's okay. Bianca told me all about you.

619
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:03,848
Yeah?

620
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:05,049
No money.

621
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,185
Always making her pay for everything.

622
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,603
Good times.

623
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:11,856
I don't know, you made her happy somehow.

624
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:18,529
She visits me sometimes in my dreams.

625
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:21,482
You too?

626
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,202
I hear her talking to me sometimes.

627
00:28:24,237 --> 00:28:27,155
I really miss her, Frank.

628
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,624
I do too.

629
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:35,897
What are you doing?

630
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:37,548
Bianca's talking to us.

631
00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:40,218
She's saying, "Go for it, you wacky kids, you."

632
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:41,586
You're confused, Frank.

633
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:42,971
It's part of the grieving process.

634
00:28:43,006 --> 00:28:45,056
You looked at me the way Bianca did.

635
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:46,641
Bianca had cancer.

636
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:49,677
That's the only reason she looked at you that way.

637
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,564
Didn't you ever ask yourself why someone

638
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,516
with her success, beauty, and education

639
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,101
would be interested in you?

640
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,736
All the time.

641
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:00,104
Face it.

642
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,907
You and Bianca were together because of cancer.

643
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,575
Not just any cancer.

644
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:08,246
Stage four. Terminal cancer.

645
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:09,998
I have to get back to my rounds.

646
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:12,450
It was nice to meet you, Frank.

647
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,757
Uh, excuse me?

648
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:22,710
Can you tell me where oncology is?

649
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,545
Next.

650
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,352
- You know why you're here? - Buy a gun.

651
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:32,520
For what purpose?

652
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:33,471
Purpose?

653
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:35,056
Scare my fucking brother,

654
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,641
who's being a complete and total douchebag.

655
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:37,792
Wrong answer, son.

656
00:29:37,827 --> 00:29:39,460
Next!

657
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,097
Yes?

658
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:45,600
Hi.

659
00:29:45,635 --> 00:29:49,237
I need to buy a gun for protection...

660
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,738
case there's a shooting here.

661
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,073
I'm scared.

662
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:55,326
Then let me soothe your nerves.

663
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:56,828
Wow.

664
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,165
You, my friend, look like a... Glock 17 kind of guy.

665
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:05,002
And for a mere $300, all this can be yours.

666
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:06,921
Can you teach me how to use it?

667
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:08,389
Uh, we're not in the training business.

668
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:09,640
That's what the internet's for.

669
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:13,177
Okay, here.

670
00:30:15,765 --> 00:30:16,564
All right.

671
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:19,133
Be safe, walk tall.

672
00:30:25,775 --> 00:30:27,642
That's Carl. He used to be white.

673
00:30:27,677 --> 00:30:29,193
Don't fuck with him.

674
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,662
I hear he ate a kid's toe in juvie.

675
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,535
Two chicken parms for the sexiest paramedics in Chicago.

676
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:39,921
There's three tables in Olga's section that need to be bussed.

677
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:40,922
Yeah, I can see that.

678
00:30:40,957 --> 00:30:42,373
Not blind.

679
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,425
Who ordered the Ativan?

680
00:30:47,363 --> 00:30:49,514
What if I can't make her get an abortion, V?

681
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:51,716
Then slip her three of these Ativan and do it yourself.

682
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,434
I could just buy one of those RUD40s

683
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,836
and crush it up in her soup.

684
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:56,771
- Fi! - I'm serious.

685
00:30:56,806 --> 00:30:59,223
You can't go behind her back and give her an abortion.

686
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,691
Stop pacing. You're making me dizzy.

687
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:02,193
Why not?

688
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,145
She snuck behind my back and got herself knocked up.

689
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:05,396
Debbie's a smart girl.

690
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:07,064
Give her some time to process everything.

691
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:08,366
- She'll come around. - What if she doesn't?

692
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:09,650
This Ativan is not working.

693
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,452
- It was a little old. - Jesus.

694
00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:12,904
Sorry. Short notice.

695
00:31:14,324 --> 00:31:16,724
I could just push her down the stairs.

696
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:23,464
Stop smiling. No one loves school.

697
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,000
It's not all coloring and glue like you remember.

698
00:31:32,342 --> 00:31:33,474
Hey, girl.

699
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,675
I'm Carl.

700
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:38,262
What's your name?

701
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,897
You don't want to tell me?

702
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:41,232
That's all right.

703
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,601
I'll just call you... my angel.

704
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,153
All right, settle down.

705
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:47,104
Settle down, people. Settle down.

706
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:49,407
Turn to page 17 in your biology books.

707
00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:52,777
See you in my dreams, Angel.

708
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,362
Who the hell are you?

709
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:55,580
He's with me.

710
00:31:55,615 --> 00:31:56,581
He doesn't belong here.

711
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:57,698
Because he's black?

712
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,584
No, because he looks 35.

713
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:01,786
He's an old soul.

714
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,107
Page 17.

715
00:32:06,142 --> 00:32:08,809
Who wants to tell me about mitosis?

716
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:31,365
Hi.

717
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:32,733
Hello.

718
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:36,103
I'm part of the cancer counseling staff.

719
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:37,121
The what?

720
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,873
I travel around the ward

721
00:32:38,908 --> 00:32:40,625
tending to people's needs.

722
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,627
Oh, I didn't know the hospital offered that.

723
00:32:42,662 --> 00:32:44,128
It's a new thing.

724
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:47,515
Do you mind if I ask what kind of cancer you have?

725
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,966
Uh, skin.

726
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:50,218
And what stage are you?

727
00:32:50,253 --> 00:32:51,302
Two.

728
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:53,454
So you'll probably beat that.

729
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:54,672
It's what they say.

730
00:32:56,593 --> 00:32:58,125
Well, that's a drag.

731
00:32:58,161 --> 00:32:59,260
Excuse me?

732
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:00,511
Oh, fuck me.

733
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:17,028
Breast.

734
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,531
Curable.

735
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,617
Colon.

736
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,036
Curable-ish.

737
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,420
Testicular.

738
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:28,256
No dudes, no dudes.

739
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:31,342
Come on, daddy needs a pancreatic.

740
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:33,344
I'm so sorry, Hilary.

741
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:35,880
Uh, why don't you take a seat, and I'll have a social worker

742
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:38,332
come by and talk to you about hospice.

743
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:47,642
Hi, Yolanda.

744
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:48,476
Hi, Bonnie.

745
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:49,527
Hi, Debbie.

746
00:33:49,562 --> 00:33:52,113
Hi, Ramon.

747
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:53,281
How are things?

748
00:33:53,316 --> 00:33:54,949
Not good. Pissed at my mom.

749
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:56,617
She wouldn't babysit Ramon this weekend

750
00:33:56,653 --> 00:33:58,286
so I could go to the mall.

751
00:33:58,321 --> 00:33:59,520
That sucks.

752
00:33:59,555 --> 00:34:01,038
Yeah, it's her stupid grandson.

753
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:04,292
I don't know why she has to be so selfish.

754
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:05,876
Do you guys think it's hard to go to school

755
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:07,545
and have a baby at the same time?

756
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,963
Totally.

757
00:34:08,998 --> 00:34:11,382
I can't wait till I'm 16 so I can quit.

758
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:12,667
Three more years.

759
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,251
My baby keeps me up all the time.

760
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:17,138
None of my Forever 21 clothes fit me anymore.

761
00:34:17,173 --> 00:34:18,506
My boyfriend ignores me.

762
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:20,591
My vagina is so big now.

763
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:21,976
Got to go.

764
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:23,144
My mom's here.

765
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:26,931
I have an orthodontist appointment.

766
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:30,101
Hey, Debs.

767
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:31,652
Bye, Bonnie.

768
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:34,105
Hey.

769
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:36,240
What are you doing here?

770
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:37,742
Came to pick you up from school.

771
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:39,026
Since when?

772
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:42,413
Since I borrowed my professor's car.

773
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:44,198
Is that a bag of flour?

774
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,533
Pretend baby.

775
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:46,500
Your niece.

776
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:48,169
Okay.

777
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:56,210
So you, uh, want to get going, or...?

778
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:57,795
Where to?

779
00:34:57,847 --> 00:34:59,347
Take you anywhere you like.

780
00:34:59,382 --> 00:35:00,348
Really?

781
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:02,133
You have no place in mind?

782
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,517
No, like where?

783
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:07,972
I don't know, maybe the clinic.

784
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:09,273
Oh.

785
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:10,524
Fiona send you?

786
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,309
Yeah.

787
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:15,529
You gonna try to talk me into getting rid of my baby?

788
00:35:15,565 --> 00:35:17,148
Yeah, that was the plan.

789
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,983
Hmm. Nice try.

790
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:20,451
Mm-hmm.

791
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:22,787
Yeah, I had a whole speech.

792
00:35:22,822 --> 00:35:25,956
You know, about not wanting you to be the girl at Costco,

793
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:28,826
three kids hanging off your shopping cart,

794
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:32,997
a fistful of food stamps, 50 pounds heavier,

795
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:36,300
you know, desperate just to find somebody to take care of you.

796
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,753
Good one.

797
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:41,222
I just want what's best for you, Debs.

798
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:49,096
Well, looks like you borrowed the car for nothing.

799
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,399
I could still give you a ride home.

800
00:35:51,434 --> 00:35:53,350
It's okay.

801
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:54,402
You sure?

802
00:35:54,437 --> 00:35:56,353
Yeah, I want to call Derek,

803
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:57,855
talk to him in private.

804
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,941
No, I mean, you sure about not going to the clinic?

805
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,827
Bye, Lip.

806
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,283
Fuck.

807
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,335
We're sorry.

808
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,454
You've reached a number that has been disconnected

809
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:14,789
or is no longer in service.

810
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:16,540
What?

811
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:21,212
We're sorry.

812
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:23,514
You've reached a number that has been disconnected

813
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,299
or is no longer in service.

814
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,635
Please check the number and dial again.

815
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:32,189
Okay, I think this schedule

816
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:35,776
accommodates everyone's requests.

817
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:44,702
What are you guys doing?

818
00:36:44,737 --> 00:36:45,703
Sorry, Miss Fiona.

819
00:36:45,738 --> 00:36:46,787
Ian said it was okay.

820
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:49,790
You're gonna just sit there?

821
00:36:49,826 --> 00:36:51,408
Can't take a break?

822
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:53,410
Did you pay for that pie?

823
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,246
Did you clock out when you were smoking with V?

824
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:56,413
I'm the assistant manager.

825
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:58,249
You keep reminding us.

826
00:36:58,301 --> 00:37:00,835
What's with the attitude?

827
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:02,169
Look, you're on my ass 24/7.

828
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,671
At home, "Did you take your meds?"

829
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,389
At work, "You're late. Pick up the pace."

830
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,341
How about some gratitude for the job I got you?

831
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:08,809
Gratitude for what?

832
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:10,227
Sloshing through fry muck all day,

833
00:37:10,263 --> 00:37:11,729
having people snap their fingers at me,

834
00:37:11,764 --> 00:37:14,648
listening to my bitchy sister boss me around?

835
00:37:14,684 --> 00:37:18,986
If you don't like it, leave.

836
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:20,020
- Fine. - Fine.

837
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,990
- I will. - Fine.

838
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:24,942
I don't need this shit.

839
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:27,411
Really?

840
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:28,829
Really?

841
00:37:28,865 --> 00:37:30,798
You're just gonna leave like that?

842
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,082
- Good. - Good!

843
00:37:32,118 --> 00:37:33,367
Go!

844
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:39,256
Nice one, boss.

845
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:40,291
Nothing cuntier

846
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:42,293
than firing a relative.

847
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,847
What?

848
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:49,300
- This job sucks. - Yeah.

849
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:50,518
Everyone's being a dick,

850
00:37:50,553 --> 00:37:52,052
and they think I'm a bitch.

851
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,804
Is this about Debbie?

852
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:57,107
No, it's not about...I don't know, maybe it is, okay?

853
00:37:57,143 --> 00:37:58,642
It's everyone.

854
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,277
It's-- it's Melinda and Adam and Olga and Ian.

855
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:01,478
I just fired Ian.

856
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:03,197
Or maybe he quit. I don't know.

857
00:38:03,232 --> 00:38:05,065
- Good. - What?

858
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:06,984
I'm sorry, Fiona, I know he's your brother,

859
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:08,536
but he's an awful busboy.

860
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:12,740
I don't know that I can handle all this responsibility.

861
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,542
You are in and out of here all day long,

862
00:38:14,577 --> 00:38:16,243
going to a million meetings, leaving me alone

863
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:17,995
to deal with everything.

864
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:23,801
I shot up.

865
00:38:23,836 --> 00:38:25,302
What?

866
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:28,556
When I was cleaning out Otis' locker,

867
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:32,593
I found a bag of china white and his hype kit...

868
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:38,065
...and, uh... um, yeah.

869
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,170
You're just telling me this now?

870
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:45,272
You had a lot on your mind.

871
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:54,081
Oh, shit.

872
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:01,171
I didn't think this was a thing.

873
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:03,374
You're sober.

874
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:07,094
It's always a thing.

875
00:39:08,798 --> 00:39:11,131
So now I got to add this to my list of crap to worry about?

876
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,883
No, listen, you don't have to worry about this at all.

877
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:14,268
Of course I have to worry.

878
00:39:14,303 --> 00:39:15,886
No, this is my thing. I've got it handled.

879
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:17,805
Handled? You found a bag of smack, and you shot up.

880
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,390
- That's handled? - Do you know how many

881
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:20,891
bags of smack I've found that I didn't shoot up?

882
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:23,277
Then why this time?

883
00:39:23,312 --> 00:39:24,528
Because I'm an addict.

884
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:26,363
So you gonna do it again?

885
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:32,786
I don't know.

886
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,408
Why do you think I've been going to all those meetings all day?

887
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,959
Oh, my God.

888
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:49,837
I'm in love with a heroin addict.

889
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:52,506
You've always been in love with a heroin addict.

890
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:55,676
But you weren't using.

891
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:58,812
Didn't make me any less of a heroin addict.

892
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:08,772
When did this happen?

893
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,358
Last night.

894
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,328
We were together last night.

895
00:40:14,363 --> 00:40:15,863
Yes.

896
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:27,808
Will you promise not to do it again?

897
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,912
That's not how this disease works.

898
00:40:31,947 --> 00:40:33,597
You know that. You've been to enough meetings.

899
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,466
I went to them because the court ordered it.

900
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:36,850
I wasn't paying attention.

901
00:40:36,886 --> 00:40:40,938
Half the time, I was flirting with you.

902
00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:43,357
I understand if you're angry and you don't wanna be

903
00:40:43,392 --> 00:40:45,943
with me anymore, but I...

904
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:48,062
I hope that's not the case.

905
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:50,447
Hey, Fiona.

906
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:51,498
What?

907
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:53,067
Bitchy much?

908
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,903
There's some nurse here to do your drug test.

909
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,739
Fuck.

910
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,657
Yeah, um, hey, I got to go.

911
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,278
I can't be here in case she wants to test me too.

912
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:06,497
Can we talk about this later?

913
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:31,355
Svetlana, my friend Kermit over here

914
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:32,940
is gonna sing "Stroke Me."

915
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,993
Okay, I program into karaoke machine, you cock head.

916
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,617
Hey, come on.

917
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:45,035
The fuck?

918
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:46,920
Since when do we have a karaoke machine?

919
00:41:46,956 --> 00:41:48,455
Since half hour ago.

920
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,542
These beardos pay $5 a song to listen to old fleabags

921
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:52,626
sing rock and roll music.

922
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:54,044
Damn.

923
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,546
I acquire barber chair in morning.

924
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:57,014
Barber's chair?

925
00:41:57,049 --> 00:41:59,183
Yeah, these clove cigarette smelling dick holes,

926
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:01,468
they like the straight razor shave.

927
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,021
I charge $30.

928
00:42:06,058 --> 00:42:09,276
Here's to the shittiest bar in the South Side!

929
00:42:12,398 --> 00:42:14,782
Nasdrovia!

930
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,001
Where is he?

931
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:35,052
Debbie...

932
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:36,970
Where's Derek?

933
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:38,722
Mom told you he moved to Florida.

934
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:40,757
Did they make him change his cell phone number too?

935
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,259
I just tried to call him.

936
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:43,393
I'll tell him you were asking about him

937
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:44,561
next time me and him talk.

938
00:42:44,597 --> 00:42:46,013
Well, what's his new number?

939
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:47,314
I'm at work.

940
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:48,849
Why are you guys doing this to us?

941
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:50,150
It's for the best.

942
00:42:50,186 --> 00:42:52,519
But you had a baby, and they loved you.

943
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:53,854
Okay.

944
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:56,940
Just give me a minute, okay?

945
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:58,659
Let's go back here.

946
00:43:05,284 --> 00:43:08,252
Debbie, Derek's parents were protecting you from the truth.

947
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:09,870
What?

948
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:12,005
Derek was the one who wanted to move to Florida.

949
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:13,373
You're lying.

950
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:14,791
He doesn't want to have a baby.

951
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:16,677
Yes, he does. We were picking out names.

952
00:43:16,712 --> 00:43:18,095
You scared him.

953
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,930
He wants to go to the Air Force Academy.

954
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:22,349
Derek wants to be a pilot.

955
00:43:22,384 --> 00:43:23,684
He wants to be a pilot?

956
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:25,102
Yeah.

957
00:43:25,137 --> 00:43:26,770
He's wanted to since he was a kid,

958
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,856
but you didn't know that, did you?

959
00:43:28,891 --> 00:43:30,941
Because you never asked him about himself.

960
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:32,609
You only cared about the baby.

961
00:43:32,645 --> 00:43:36,813
Guys want to feel supported, not trapped.

962
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:41,151
I-I didn't mean to trap him.

963
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:42,870
I'm sorry, Debbie.

964
00:43:42,905 --> 00:43:44,988
I have to go back to work.

965
00:44:05,177 --> 00:44:06,843
Excuse me.

966
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:08,145
What?

967
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,515
You're taking up two handicap seats.

968
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:13,650
Sorry.

969
00:44:13,686 --> 00:44:15,152
Shit, that's my stop.

970
00:44:19,108 --> 00:44:21,074
No!

971
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,809
My baby's on the train!

972
00:44:22,845 --> 00:44:24,828
My flour baby Desiree!

973
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:41,845
You did all that for her?

974
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,046
I did.

975
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:45,215
And you'd do those things for me?

976
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:48,001
Every single one of them, and then some if you wanted.

977
00:44:48,037 --> 00:44:49,219
Whatever's on your list.

978
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:52,189
Think of me as your cancer concierge.

979
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:54,608
But why?

980
00:44:54,643 --> 00:44:57,894
With Bianca, it was because I loved her.

981
00:44:57,947 --> 00:44:59,730
Wish it was the same with you.

982
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:04,067
But who knows, maybe over time.

983
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,737
I'd like to say I was being selfless

984
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:08,572
and I just want to make you feel better,

985
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:12,492
but I've never been a selfless man.

986
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:14,461
No one really is.

987
00:45:14,496 --> 00:45:15,796
Truth of the matter is,

988
00:45:15,831 --> 00:45:20,167
I just need to get Bianca out of my system.

989
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:22,836
And by having sex on the train tracks,

990
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:24,254
that'll do it?

991
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,940
One can only hope.

992
00:45:28,761 --> 00:45:31,561
I'm embarrassed to say that I haven't been touched

993
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:33,981
in over 15 years.

994
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:38,068
You let me worry about that.

995
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,827
Just hold that up to your pretty lips.

996
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,000
Inhale.

997
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:58,972
Slowly, slowly.

998
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:01,208
Good.

999
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,377
Good.

1000
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:06,546
Hold it in your lungs.

1001
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:09,683
Pretty soon, you'll feel the crack

1002
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:13,020
coursing through your veins,

1003
00:46:13,055 --> 00:46:17,274
and all your troubles will just...

1004
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:20,427
What'd I tell you?

1005
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:28,235
Hilary?

1006
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:30,120
Hilary, you okay?

1007
00:46:33,242 --> 00:46:34,658
You can exhale now.

1008
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:40,297
Hilary?

1009
00:46:45,337 --> 00:46:47,137
Hey.

1010
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:48,472
Hilary?

1011
00:46:52,594 --> 00:46:55,178
Oh, shit. Um...

1012
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:32,799
Hey, are you at the clinic?

1013
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:34,184
Couldn't convince her.

1014
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:35,635
Are you kidding me?

1015
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,137
No, she's got her mind set.

1016
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:39,639
Well, we got to unset it.

1017
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,141
Meet me back at the house.

1018
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:42,392
We'll go at her together.

1019
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:43,727
Okay.

1020
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:44,978
You're all good.

1021
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,813
Great, thanks.

1022
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:49,950
I'll just make a note of your pre-existing condition.

1023
00:47:49,985 --> 00:47:51,318
Pre-existing condition?

1024
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,036
The pregnancy.

1025
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:54,788
My-- my sister's pregnancy?

1026
00:47:54,823 --> 00:47:58,291
Your sister? No, you.

1027
00:47:58,327 --> 00:47:59,543
W-what?

1028
00:47:59,578 --> 00:48:01,578
You didn't know you were pregnant?

1029
00:48:03,582 --> 00:48:04,548
What?

1030
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:06,299
Congratulations.

1031
00:48:06,335 --> 00:48:08,835
I hope it's good news.

1032
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,137
Take care now.

1033
00:48:22,851 --> 00:48:24,518
Debbie?

1034
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:30,073
Where are you?

1035
00:48:32,244 --> 00:48:33,827
I have something to tell you.

1036
00:48:33,862 --> 00:48:35,078
- Knock first! - What are you doing?

1037
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:36,613
None of your business.

1038
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:38,114
Let's go to the clinic right now, together.

1039
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:39,533
They don't close for another half hour.

1040
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:41,084
Oh, my God, how many times do I have to tell you,

1041
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,203
I am not killing my baby!

1042
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:44,955
- Why are you doing this to me? - To you?

1043
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:46,957
Why does everything always have to be about you?

1044
00:48:47,009 --> 00:48:49,092
Because I'm finally almost free from raising you kids,

1045
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:50,877
and I don't intend to do it again.

1046
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:53,013
- Nobody's asking you to. - Of course you are!

1047
00:48:53,048 --> 00:48:54,631
There's absolutely no way in hell

1048
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:56,716
that you're going to be able to raise a baby,

1049
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:58,768
and I am going to get stuck doing it!

1050
00:48:58,804 --> 00:49:00,887
Oh, don't worry, I would never let you near my baby.

1051
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,473
I don't want you fucking it up like you fucked us up!

1052
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:05,192
- I'm going to Florida. - Florida?

1053
00:49:05,227 --> 00:49:07,227
- What are you talking about? - Let go of me.

1054
00:49:07,279 --> 00:49:08,395
Fuck.

1055
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:12,199
You don't even know where Derek is!

1056
00:49:12,234 --> 00:49:13,934
Florida is eight million miles long!

1057
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:15,535
Too bad, Fiona, I'll find him!

1058
00:49:15,571 --> 00:49:17,821
He wants to be a pilot, and I'm going to support him.

1059
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:19,656
- He doesn't love you. - Yes, he does.

1060
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:21,708
You are not going to Florida.

1061
00:49:21,743 --> 00:49:24,411
- Ow, get off me! - Aah!

1062
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:26,546
- You are going to that clinic! - You're hurting me!

1063
00:49:26,582 --> 00:49:29,583
Ow! Stop it. You are going to that clinic!

1064
00:49:29,635 --> 00:49:31,151
Help!

1065
00:49:31,186 --> 00:49:33,003
My sister's trying to force me to get an abortion!

1066
00:49:33,055 --> 00:49:35,088
Fiona, get off her.

1067
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,423
No!

1068
00:49:36,475 --> 00:49:39,593
We are going to that fucking clinic!

1069
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,402
Fucking Gallaghers.

1070
00:49:57,946 --> 00:50:00,680
That piece of shit Yanis woke up the babies again!

1071
00:50:03,252 --> 00:50:05,201
I'm taking care of this once and for all.

1072
00:50:05,254 --> 00:50:06,953
How?

1073
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,788
I'm gonna cut his throttle cable when he goes back inside.

1074
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,206
I'll be right back.

1075
00:51:00,008 --> 00:51:01,941
Hey.

1076
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:05,445
Can I come in?

1077
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,913
Uh-huh.

1078
00:51:17,526 --> 00:51:20,160
It was a...

1079
00:51:20,195 --> 00:51:23,997
it was a long meeting.

1080
00:51:24,032 --> 00:51:25,999
I'm sorry I'm so late.

1081
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,036
It's okay.

1082
00:51:50,492 --> 00:51:55,195
Look, I can't promise I won't do it again,

1083
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,613
but what I can promise is that I won't--

1084
00:51:56,648 --> 00:51:59,032
You need to shut up now.

1085
00:52:03,655 --> 00:52:06,539
- Mm. - Here's what's gonna happen.

1086
00:52:09,578 --> 00:52:13,713
You're gonna shut off your brain...

1087
00:52:13,749 --> 00:52:15,548
and breathe into your body.

1088
00:52:18,837 --> 00:52:21,671
- Mm. - Close your eyes...

1089
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:25,675
relax...

1090
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,677
and let me do all the work.

1091
00:53:24,886 --> 00:53:26,236
What the fuck?

1092
00:53:26,288 --> 00:53:27,871
I thought you cut the throttle cable.

1093
00:53:27,906 --> 00:53:30,423
I did.

1094
00:53:33,929 --> 00:53:37,497
I don't know how he's riding without the throttle cable.

1095
00:53:37,549 --> 00:53:39,399
Are you sure you cut the right cable?

1096
00:53:39,434 --> 00:53:41,584
Yes, there's only two cables, the throttle cable and the--

1097
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:43,002
Aah! Aah!

1098
00:53:46,725 --> 00:53:48,975
The brake cable.

1099
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:50,443
Uh-oh.

1100
00:53:59,738 --> 00:54:01,855
Be gone, spirit of Bianca.

1101
00:54:06,862 --> 00:54:08,611
Oh, shit.
