1
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,920
In the land of mountains, moorlands and lakes


2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,600
lies a valley of wide open spaces and fertile fields.


3
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,120
This is the eastern corner
of Cumbria. Its farming heart.


4
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,280
I am in the Eden Valley.


5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,120
This place is sometimes called
Cumbria's best-kept secret.


6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,680
But not any more. Thanks to the
World Sheepdog Trials, people


7
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,240
have flocked here from all over the
globe to watch the experts at work.


8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,840
High above the valley in the fells,
far away from the sheepdog trials,


9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,640
I'll be getting a taste of sheep
farming at its most extreme.


10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,760
When the winds howl,
the rains pour and the snow falls,


11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,480
life here can be pretty tough.


12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,560
So, just how is this piece
of hi-tech kit going to help?


13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,840
I'll be finding out.


14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,400
While back at the sheepdog trials,
just as the rain really gets going,


15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,600
Helen and I go head-to-head
in a challenge of our own.


16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,200
We've got this in the bag.


17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,640
Farmer's daughter versus farmer's son.


18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,120
And I'll be taking a close look
at radical new proposals


19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,360
to change our planning laws.


20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,720
They could lead to many more houses being built.


21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,560
Would that ruin some lovely parts of our countryside


22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,320
or revive many rural communities?
That's what I'll be investigating.


23
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,600
Also tonight, Adam's herd is facing
another test for bovine TB.


24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,400
He doesn't want to lose any cattle,
but one in particular is on his mind.


25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,640
Eric has got a real place in my heart now.


26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,800
If he got TB and had to be put down,
that would bring a tear to my eye.


27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,760
The lush green slopes of the Eden Valley.


28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,600
A hidden jewel...


29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,800
set between the rocky peaks
of its better-known neighbours,


30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,560
the Lake District and the Pennines.


31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,320
And at the heart of the valley is
the 75,000 acre Lowther Estate.


32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,680
Today, the estate is host to
the World Sheepdog Trials,


33
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,080
an international event that will
draw crowds of up to 40,000 people.


34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,720
It's the latest event
in the estate's 800-year history.


35
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,640
Once the Lowther Estate was so large,


36
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,360
you could walk from the east coast
to the west coast


37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,560
without ever leaving it.


38
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,480
But by 1957, life wasn't so sweet.


39
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,000
In a bid to avoid inheritance tax,


40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,760
the roof was stripped off this once
magnificent castle.


41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,720
The building, left to rack and ruin.


42
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,840
Now, thanks to a £9 million grant,
it has been restored and the rest


43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,360
of the estate is not doing too bad either.


44
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,720
I'm meeting estate manager
Richard Price to discover


45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,280
how they are making this historic
estate fit for the 21st century.


46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,120
Where is the money coming from
for all of this work?


47
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,560
The actual castle project is being
put into a trust,


48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,800
the Lowther Castle Gardens Trust.


49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,560
And the money for that is coming
from the public sector,


50
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,320
large funding organisations like
the North West Development Agency


51
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,000
and things have moved forward very fast.


52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
And very proud of what is happening with that.


53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,200
It is very much the hub
and the crown of the estate.


54
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,640
And how much does having the
World Sheepdog Trials here help?


55
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,880
It means a lot for the local community.


56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,600
It brings a lot of income
into the local community.


57
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,720
While the World Sheepdog Trials
are bringing 240 shepherds


58
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,560
from around the world to Lowther,


59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,520
they do have plenty of their own
sheep to look after.


60
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,640
The estate runs 5,000 of these mule sheep.


61
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,680
They have a hardy Swaledale mum
and a lean, muscly,


62
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,160
Blue-faced Leicester dad making them
rugged for this environment,


63
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,600
but ideal for the table.


64
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,800
John Harrison is the estate's head shepherd.


65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,400
He's working hard behind the scenes to get


66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,080
the huge amounts of sheep ready,
in the right place for the trials.


67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,480
So, John, are you tempted to have
a go at the trials this year


68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,280
because you could?
Former English national champion.


69
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,800
Well, I mean, it would be nice to but I haven't


70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,720
competed for about 10 or 12 years now,


71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,560
so I've probably lost the edge.


72
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,160
It would be nice to have a go,
I must be honest.


73
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,000
Sure. There are handlers coming
from all over the world.


74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,560
I'm not sure what they'll make of the mules.


75
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,840
It will be interesting to find out really.


76
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,320
The interesting thing is, every handler


77
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,160
gets a different set of sheep.


78
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,040
This is a nightmare for you
to keep things moving around?


79
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,200
We have over 1,200 sheep to get ready
for the trials in the next four days.


80
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,240
Luckily, we have a good, strong committee


81
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,280
and a lot of helpers to help as well.


82
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,240
There is a lot of work involved,


83
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,000
early mornings and late nights unfortunately.


84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,040
What does it mean to you as head
shepherd to have the world trials?


85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,160
It's tremendous that it has come here.


86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,120
And also for the local environment.


87
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,240
You know, with all the people
coming in and the local community,


88
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,320
it is fantastic for that as well.


89
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,840
Back at the trials,
the competition is well under way.


90
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,520
I have arranged to meet up with
Katy Cropper who won


91
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,960
One Man And His Dog in 1990.


92
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,960
'Well done, lass, that is
what I call a good trial.'


93
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,600
The first woman to do so.


94
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,920
Katy, here is the BBC Television trophy.


95
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,120
That is something to keep, isn't it?


96
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,760
Wonderful, wait a minute.


97
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,680
She now lives and works right on
the doorstep in the Eden Valley.


98
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,680
What a wonderful thing to have the
World Sheepdog Trials here.


99
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,120
Yes, it's gorgeous.
This is God's country.


100
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,000
As you can see, it's the
most stunning, stunning scenery.


101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,080
The trial field looks fantastic.


102
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,000
There is a tremendous feel to it.


103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,040
It couldn't be more perfect for
the trial. It is not easy.


104
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,200
Field number one is quite a tricky course.


105
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,880
Some of those sheep are quite contrary.


106
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,080
I actually did the course
the night before the actual trial.


107
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,400
How was it?


108
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,080
Lovely. I think I should have won it!


109
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,680
There are some right rough ground
going from the shedding ring


110
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,120
to the pen so you wouldn't be wanting
to wear your Jimmy Choos


111
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
because it really is quite rough.


112
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,960
But for the dogs and the handlers, that win this,


113
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,120
it is a big deal, isn't it,
the World Championships?


114
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,520
Fantastic!


115
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,360
And it can be quite lucrative.
Oh, I'm sure.


116
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,040
Depending on who the person is that
wins with their dog,


117
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,320
you never know,
the dog will be worth a lot of money.


118
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,600
We've got the best dogs and the best
handlers from all over the world.


119
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,800
But not the best of the weather.


120
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,280
Heavy rain is affecting the trials.


121
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,560
Later I'll be meeting a couple
of the international competitors


122
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,480
who have braved the Cumbrian climate.


123
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,640
In just a couple of weeks' time,
the Government's consultation


124
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,520
on making radical changes to
our planning rules comes to an end.


125
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,040
The proposals couldn't be more controversial.


126
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,000
But what difference will they really
make? John has been to investigate.


127
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,680
England's planning laws rose
out of the ashes of World War II,


128
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
to prevent a free-for-all in building.


129
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,800
But fast-forward to today
and they've created a bureaucracy


130
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,880
with 1,300 pages of planning guidance,


131
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,440
causing delays which cost the economy
an estimated £3 billion every year.


132
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,080
Now, the Government has decided it's time 
to speed up the whole planning process,


133
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,040
in a bid to get more homes built
and kick-start the economy.


134
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,000
All those pages of guidance
will be cut to just 52.


135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,880
But these proposals have
exploded into a war of words


136
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,320
between ministers
and deeply concerned heritage groups.


137
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,040
The protection for the green belt...


138
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,080
I'm not a left-winger.
I'm not a fanatical.


139
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,000
..rather than replacing...


140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,080
What's causing the uproar is
the Government's idea that


141
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,560
councils should have a presumption
in favour of what they call


142
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,120
sustainable development.
In other words,


143
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,920
they should be more likely to approve
new housing than turn it down.


144
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,040
So, would these new laws ride
roughshod over the countryside,


145
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,160
or would they throw a vital
lifeline to rural communities


146
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,360
with an uncertain future?


147
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,680
To try to shed some light on
what the proposals could mean,


148
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,880
we've picked two villages in Somerset with 
very different prospects for the future.


149
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,680
First, East Coker in the south of the county,


150
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,600
a quintessentially English village.


151
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,520
Good morning, John.
Good morning, what a beautiful day.


152
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,080
1,400 people live here
including Martin Sowerbutts


153
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,560
who is taking me on a visit to the local church.


154
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,480
Here we are, John.


155
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,760
If we go up the tower I can show you
what we are talking about.


156
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,080
Right up the top, there.


157
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,360
'But we're not just heading up high
to get a bird's-eye view


158
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,120
'of this lovely village of 900 homes.'


159
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,720
Many more to go?


160
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,720
About halfway I should say, John.


161
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,360
Martin wants to show me a development
site for up to 3,700 houses


162
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,840
which could be built right on their doorsteps.


163
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,560
Well worth the climb! What a view!


164
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,920
Fantastic, isn't it?


165
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,720
So where exactly is this proposed
development going to be?


166
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,240
You see the brown field ahead of us,
it will span across there,


167
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,960
to the left, behind this tree.


168
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,840
To the outskirts of Yeovil?


169
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,280
It will join on to the outskirts of Yeovil


170
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,040
and go right across to the houses on the horizon.


171
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,840
It will look like, essentially,
gravy pouring down from Yeovil


172
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,120
into the Vale of East Coker.


173
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,720
All the area they're going to build
on is grade 1 agricultural land.


174
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,040
The finest and most fertile available.


175
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,200
It accounts for something less than 5% 
of all agricultural land in England.


176
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,200
And to build on that,
well, I think it's criminal.


177
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,360
Although sites like green belts
will still be protected,


178
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,840
proposals to defend premium farmland 
like this have yet to be approved,


179
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,200
leaving them at risk of development.


180
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,840
Many see East Coker's case


181
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,080
as the sort of battle that could
take place right across the country,


182
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,680
if the new changes go through.


183
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,520
To give you some idea of the effect 
it'd have, I have a photograph here


184
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,520
which gives a representation of what it would 
look like if this development went ahead.


185
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,320
You can see all of the houses here
would be covering that area there.


186
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,480
'Although this artist's impression has been 
done for those opposed to the development,


187
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,960
'it's undeniable that this many
houses will have a dramatic impact.'


188
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,080
So how far
is this village going to take it?


189
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,840
Well, we didn't want it, but we think 
in some ways we're a test case.


190
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,280
With all the assets East Coker
has got, the heritage, the farming,


191
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,520
the quality of the land, if we can't
actually make our case stick,


192
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,640
then we think that nowhere
in the country's going to be safe,


193
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,040
particularly under the new planning framework.


194
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,320
The Government says new planning guidelines will 
put power back in the hands of local people.


195
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,440
Here, in South Somerset,
they're not so sure about that.


196
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,920
The woman who represents East Coker
on the district council


197
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,040
says her colleagues have little alternative
but to do what the Government wants.


198
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,000
My preference would have been to spread 
the houses amongst the villages,


199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,600
because I believe that protects the school,


200
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,120
the shops and the pub


201
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,320
and other community facilities,


202
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,640
but what the Government wants
is to have the development


203
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,000
on the edge of towns with employment land


204
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,720
and with retail provision within
that area along with the houses,


205
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,240
and so that is what the district 
council's had to put into their plan.


206
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,480
What you're saying is, it's not
really your local district plan,


207
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,040
it's a plan that the Government
is imposing on you.


208
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,480
Certainly, if we don't have
a local plan which goes this way,


209
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,840
developers will be able to come along and say,


210
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,720
we are going to develop here, or wherever,


211
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,640
and we won't be able to refuse them


212
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,760
because we haven't identified somewhere 
else more suitable for them to go.


213
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,200
I certainly don't want it to be
a free-for-all for developers.


214
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,680
The council say the development
would bring benefits to the area,


215
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,640
but can't be specific
until plans are finalised.


216
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,600
So are existing businesses
positive about the proposals?


217
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Good morning. Hello there.


218
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,920
Could I have the local paper, please?
No problem. That's 70 pence, please.


219
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,000
I suppose you'll be glad when the new
houses are put up, good for business?


220
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,240
No, we don't think so, actually.


221
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,880
We believe with the size of
the estate it's going to be,


222
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,760
they'll bring shops with them,


223
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,240
possibly a mini supermarket,
and we think it's going to
draw customers away from us.


224
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,960
'In East Coker, it's hard to
find people in favour of
the proposed development,


225
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,680
'and that's the big concern about
these possible planning changes,


226
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,960
'that they
simply won't take into account


227
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,080
'the views of local people
if they're against development.'


228
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,160
But in other places, there are those
who believe these plans
could actually work in their favour.


229
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,680
I'm on my way now to a village
about 20 minutes away
called Queen Camel,


230
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,920
where the people there
are wanting new houses.


231
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,960
People power is working here,


232
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:50,600
because the community is doing what
it appears the Government wants them
to do, namely, ask for more housing.


233
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,920
Parish councillor Rosemary Heath
Coleman helped put together a plan


234
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,600
for the future of their village.


235
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,880
We've been selected by
the Government as a guinea pig


236
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,760
for a neighbourhood
development plan.


237
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,640
How many affordable homes
do you need here now?


238
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,520
Well, that's still a question
to be answered,


239
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,640
but if I said to you 20-ish,


240
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,400
we will build, I hope,
according to the need.


241
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,240
And that's the difference.


242
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,200
Here, we're talking about
a few affordable homes wanted


243
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,520
by the community to help sustain
their village, whereas in East Coker,


244
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,360
they fear a whole new town
will be forced onto their doorstep.


245
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,600
While the children of Queen Camel
enjoy playtime,


246
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,080
the village has been given
a £20,000 government grant
to plan for the future.


247
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,360
You have got a lively school here.
We certainly have.


248
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,360
What difference do you think the
neighbourhood plan is going to make?


249
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,680
It will be good to have our numbers
rising again.


250
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,880
We have fallen over
the last few years,


251
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,360
though we've turned a corner now and
we are beginning to increase again.


252
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,040
So, the whole point
of the neighbourhood plan


253
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,000
is that it's going to allow people
who can afford to live
in the countryside


254
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,200
to be here
with their young children.


255
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,880
Absolutely, that's what we want.


256
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,880
You want a real mix
in the countryside,


257
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,720
not just lots of old people,
young families, too.


258
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,760
So is this what the new planning
regulations will bring about,


259
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,520
or is it more likely to be
mass development of the kind
feared by East Coker?


260
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,920
Well, in fact,
there may be a third way,


261
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,880
that no-one's anticipating,
as I'll be revealing later.


262
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,000
It's grey and it's cold.


263
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm on my way to meet some
hill farmers.


264
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,320
Not these guys. They wouldn't know
one end of a sheep from another!


265
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,080
But what they're doing
could make a real difference
to the way hill farmers work.


266
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,840
These guys aren't
playing around with a kid's toy.


267
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,920
This is £30,000 worth of
military technology that's been
adapted for civilian use.


268
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,880
We'll find out
more about that a bit later on.


269
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,160
Meg! Meg!


270
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,000
Here are a couple of farmers
who stand to benefit.


271
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,240
Father and son Chris
and Richard Harrison.


272
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,600
Unlike our men in black,
they know all about sheep,


273
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,040
and when I caught up with them,
the sun was actually shining.


274
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,600
I'm here to help bring
these Swaledales down off the fells.


275
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,880
It's the time of year when the lambs
are weaned off their tired mums,


276
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,840
and we couldn't do it without
the help of a good working dog.


277
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,320
Chris, I'm in awe of your dog.
How easy was she to train?


278
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,280
Meg, she was a natural, really.


279
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,680
She more or less trained herself!


280
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,160
From about eight months old, she used
to run left, right, sit, stop,


281
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,600
and you just had to add
commands to it.


282
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,280
So "get away" is go right?


283
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,080
"Get away" is go to the right,
"get by" is go to the left.


284
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,200
OK.


285
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,600
I'm doing well if I can get my dog
to sit in one place for 30 seconds.


286
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,040
Meg, get away!


287
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,280
She's not moving. Try again.


288
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,040
Meg. Get away!


289
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,480
You haven't got
the right tone of voice.


290
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,400
She's looking.
She just listens to me, really.


291
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,120
Meg, get away, Meg.


292
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,680
Get away!


293
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,560
I thought she was just out of range,
but you're right, it is me!


294
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,080
'I've got to crack this,


295
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,120
'because I'm taking Matt on
at the sheepdog trials later.


296
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,400
'Chris reckons
it's all in the name.'


297
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,320
We tend to give dogs names
with just one syllable.


298
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,160
My dogs have been called Twig,
Rock, Meg.


299
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,200
It's for command reasons, really.


300
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,680
When you shout, if it's just one
sharp word, they can understand.


301
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,160
So Meg's good. We had a Bob.


302
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,440
But we also had a Mandy.


303
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,320
Bob's a good name for a dog,
but I'm not too sure about Mandy.


304
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,560
She was a nice dog,
I'm not sure she was that efficient.
I'm not doubting she was a nice dog!


305
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,120
So if I'm going to beat
Matt Baker, I need a woman's dog.


306
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,720
I think so. You need a dog
that will listen to a woman.


307
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,640
Insert your own punchline there!


308
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Well, Meg doesn't listen
to a word I say,


309
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,960
so I'm hoping Jack
will pay more attention.


310
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,680
I doubt it very much.
He doesn't listen to me very much.


311
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,240
Thank you.


312
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,120
How old is Jack?


313
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,960
He's just turned two.
So he's a bit more mischievous?


314
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,840
He is a little bit, yes.
He's a young dog but
he's still learning, just as I am.


315
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,000
Bye.


316
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,800
Bye.


317
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,960
Say his name. Jack, bye.


318
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,360
Bye. Go on, they're looking!


319
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,880
Bye, Jack.


320
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,160
Well, Richard's bound to do better.


321
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,280
He's had more practice than me.


322
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,560
But I am trying.


323
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,120
Maybe I'll be more use
down on the farm.


324
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,960
'Things can get tricky
when you stand in the wrong place.'


325
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,280
That was my own fault. I knew that!


326
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,960
'And noisy.'


327
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,800
THEY BLEAT


328
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,000
Remember, though, this is
the first time these lambs
will have been without Mum.


329
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,280
They really sound like
they're saying, "Mum!"


330
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,000
You're going to be fine.


331
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,040
You're going to love it out there.


332
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,960
These lambs will stay on low ground,
grazing and growing up.


333
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,800
Their mums are back off up the fells
to winter on high ground.


334
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,120
And I mean high ground.


335
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,880
Near 2,000 feet.


336
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,560
With the kind of winters they get
round these parts, that's harsh.


337
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,480
Remember these two?


338
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,720
Well, they reckon their fancy
flying machine could be the answer
to our hill farmers' prayers.


339
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,040
When the snow gets deep
and the tractors won't budge,


340
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,640
then this bit of kit
comes into its own.


341
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,760
It's designed to fly over
hard-to-get-to terrain.


342
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,640
Just the job when
your sheep are thousands of feet up.


343
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,520
A special camera underneath
streams live video pictures
back to a laptop,


344
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,360
but the cute bit is,
you can tell this flying shepherd
exactly where to go.


345
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,920
Can you get it to fly from A to B?


346
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,240
I can indeed.
I can demonstrate that now.


347
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,920
I can set some waypoints up here.


348
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,320
Then what it will do,
if I now set this waypoint active,


349
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,640
what it will do now is fly between
the three waypoints that I've set.


350
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,120
You can now see on the camera
it's turning to the right. Oh, wow!


351
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,760
The craft flies right over
Chris the farmer's flock.


352
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,880
The tiny white dots you can
just about see are his sheep.


353
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,320
Can you send the camera over our
heads? Yeah, that's very easy to do.


354
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,880
You grab the centre of the orbit
we're currently on.


355
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,240
Set it active, and there we are. Oh!


356
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,120
We're quite small, aren't we?


357
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,080
We are. With this current camera,
we will look very small.


358
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,840
We can see there are people there.


359
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,040
The technology was developed to be
used in war zones like Afghanistan,


360
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,880
so the Cumbrian hillside
shouldn't be a problem.


361
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,880
But what does our farmer Chris
think of it?


362
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,280
The cost of this
is probably out of the way


363
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,400
for the hill farmer, but maybe
a contractor who has one of these,


364
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,240
and say there's the Commons
or the Lakeland fells
where there's vast, open spaces,


365
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,200
where you can't get to
with a quad bike,


366
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,160
maybe the commoners
could get together


367
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,000
on a day when they're
going to gather the Commons
and get the contractor in,


368
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,920
send him out to have a look
to see where the sheep are at,


369
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,040
so they could save time
by going to certain areas
on the moors and Commons.


370
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,240
So just hire one?
Just hire one for the day.


371
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:52,000
This is a prototype, but it's
already attracting the interest of
outfits like the mountain rescue.


372
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,520
It would make a difference in terms
of getting people off the mountains?


373
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,760
Absolutely, yeah.


374
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,320
You could imagine a scenario where
somebody's thrown a quad bike over.


375
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,640
At the minute,
the option is you put runners,


376
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,760
fast-running guys will go up the hill
and follow the track
and see where the guy is.


377
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,640
Well, we just throw this in the air,
let it go hunt him down,


378
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,000
and then we can go in with a vehicle
ready to rescue the guy.


379
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
After about 20 minutes aloft,


380
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,240
the craft is ready to land
all by itself.


381
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,520
Ouch!


382
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,600
Quite a robust little thing,
isn't it? Heavy landing.


383
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,880
So, I think we all agree
it's got a future,


384
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,960
but does that mean
the end of the working dog?


385
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,240
I don't think so.


386
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,280
I don't think it makes you worry
about early retirement just yet.


387
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,400
You're all right, Meg.


388
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,800
There'll be a few dogs back at
the fourth World Sheepdog trials


389
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,960
that'll be pleased to know that.


390
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,920
At the Lowther Estate,
behind the scenes,


391
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,280
the competition is in full swing.


392
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,200
Growing up on a sheep farm,
sheepdogs have always been
a big part of my life.


393
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,000
It's a real treat for me to be here.


394
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,040
I trained my first one
when I was 14.


395
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,560
This is where all the handlers
hang out before they nip off
to the post.


396
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,360
This is Karin and Lyn,
how did you get on out there,


397
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,000
as you're from Norway?
I was pleased with the run,


398
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,440
pleased with the dog,
but it won't be enough.


399
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,680
Right. It's a long way to come,
isn't it,


400
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,440
for one shot?


401
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,280
Is the sheepdog trialling world
quite similar in Norway,
as to what you're experiencing here?


402
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,800
It's nearly the same,
the same type of courses,


403
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,480
the sheep are a bit more heavy.


404
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,040
Yeah. Same rules but the sport
is not as big as over here.


405
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,320
There are handlers from America,


406
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,920
from the Faroe Islands,
and even Japan and Brazil.


407
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,080
This is the Brazilian team
over here.


408
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,800
Good to see you, how are you? Nice.


409
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,720
Now, it's going very well for one
particular member of your team.


410
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,160
We could expect to do well,
but maybe not that well.


411
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,200
Right. And what do you make
of Cumbria?


412
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,640
The farm area and stuff,
it's pretty.


413
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,280
And the environment,
we enjoy ourselves very much
in the world trials.


414
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,600
And you're the breeder of the dog
that currently has the second
highest score in the world.


415
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,840
Yes, shouldn't have sold it!


416
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,240
This is a lovely touch,
you have your crook in this.


417
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,600
Actually, I brought this for my wife.


418
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,960
While you've been here? Yes.


419
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,360
Oh, isn't that lovely?


420
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,600
She gave me the visa to
come by myself so I have to
bring something back.


421
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,320
You keep smiling and wish
the team all the very best.


422
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,520
Hopefully your score will remain
in the top two. We'll keep
our fingers crossed.


423
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,960
Now, the second part of
John's investigation.


424
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,760
Earlier, we heard a tale
of two villages.


425
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,680
East Coker, which is facing
the prospect of thousands
of new houses forced on it,


426
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,240
and Queen Camel, where the
community's driving a project


427
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,160
to build 20 affordable homes.
Two very different examples


428
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,160
of the way Westminster


429
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,720
would like to free up
the planning laws.


430
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,920
The Government says that its proposed
changes to planning


431
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,800
are aimed at making more land
available for housing,


432
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,160
and so boosting the economy
in the process.


433
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,880
But already there's a lot of land
that's been given the go-ahead


434
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,680
for housing,
but where nothing is happening.


435
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,080
Not only are there enough
brownfield sites out there


436
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,800
to build around 750,000 homes,


437
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,080
up to half of which may be
in the countryside,


438
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,960
there are also countless rural sites
that have been bought,
but not developed.


439
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,040
This is a rather nice place
for a walk, isn't it?


440
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,720
It is lovely at the moment.


441
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,840
Did you know that they have,
back in 2009,


442
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,240
obtained consent for 1,200 homes?


443
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,920
To be built on these fields?


444
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,640
Quite a significant part of it
would be built on.


445
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,120
So why are there no houses
here then?


446
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,880
It's difficult to know -
lots of developers will have land


447
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,800
that they have planning
permission on, but won't
necessarily be building.


448
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,280
There may be many reasons -
generally developers will hold on
to land bank stock.


449
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,240
So how big is this land bank
at the moment?


450
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,880
There is some talk that there is
probably enough consent


451
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,440
for something like 700,000 homes
throughout the UK.


452
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,560
So that's about
two or three years' supply


453
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,680
of new homes
that are not being built.


454
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,880
That's right.


455
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,840
So if firms can't afford to build
on land that's already
earmarked for housing,


456
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,240
what difference will relaxing
the planning laws really make?


457
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,960
Local building contractor
David Pinckney thinks the changes
could be just enough


458
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,680
to kick-start the house-building
industry again.


459
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,960
I think the principle behind it
is very sound.


460
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,440
Anything that cuts down and
simplifies the planning process


461
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:04,080
is certainly going to help
contribute to more
development opportunities.


462
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,680
It will be interesting to see
how that works in practice.


463
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,320
Do you think this idea of
speeding up the planning process


464
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,960
will create more jobs
in the building industry?


465
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,360
I think it will
in the long term, yes.


466
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,840
If we can speed up the process
and encourage development,


467
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,800
it will certainly lead
to significant jobs
of projects such as this.


468
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,680
We're able to create over
1.5 permanent jobs
for every home we build.


469
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,000
If we are able to meet
the demand that's required,
certainly in rural communities,


470
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,640
we can create hundreds of thousands
of jobs in the industry.


471
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,080
But even if more houses are built,
will those who need them most
be able to afford them?


472
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,400
I'm going to meet a couple where
houses in their village


473
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
are way out of their price bracket.


474
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,040
How do you feel about a situation
where young people


475
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,920
just can't afford to live in the
places where they were brought up?


476
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,480
I think it's quite bad, really.


477
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,080
When you're brought up somewhere,
you really enjoy it as a kid,


478
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,600
got memories and stuff there.


479
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,640
And when you can't live and have
your own child live that life,


480
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,040
it's quite sad, really.


481
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,200
House prices here are just
out of your reach, are they?


482
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,760
Yeah, completely. They're way out.


483
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,080
'But there is hope for Chris
and Katie and baby Jack


484
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,120
'because they live in Queen Camel,


485
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,800
'where, as we heard earlier,
there are now hopes of building
around 20 affordable homes.'


486
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,440
And the new houses that are being
planned here,


487
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,800
I think there'll be an opportunity to
part-buy and part-rent.


488
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,800
That's right. That will get you
a bit more stability. Yeah.


489
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,920
Then you can own so much
of the house as well.


490
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,360
So, will you be very disappointed if
you don't get one of these houses?


491
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,720
I would be, yes, very disappointed.
Definitely.


492
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,480
From what I've seen,
it appears whilst these changes


493
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,000
have the potential
to give communities like Queen Camel


494
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,960
a new lease of life,


495
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,560
a combination of vague language
and putting more power


496
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,640
in the hands of developers


497
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,240
may also leave it open to abuse.


498
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,400
It seems inevitable that
the new planning regulations


499
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,120
will take some protection
away from rural areas


500
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,640
but only when we see it work in
practice will we know the true impact


501
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,240
on the countryside.


502
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,280
Shortly on Countryfile,


503
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,360
Helen's on the hunt for
buried treasure deep underground.


504
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,320
It's really quite gorgeous,
isn't it?


505
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,760
At the Sheepdog Trials, we go
head-to-head in the show ring.


506
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,920
Steady!


507
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,200
But, it's the rain that's winning.


508
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,600
And, what about the weather
for the week ahead?


509
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,840
The Countryfile forecast
will reveal all.


510
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,600
As well as its rain, Cumbria is
rightly famous for its sheep.


511
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,760
But that's not the only kind of
farming around here.


512
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,120
Business is booming
for a new brood of farmers,


513
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,400
supplying one of the biggest
free-range egg producers
in the country.


514
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,720
Katie's been to find out more.


515
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,680
14.5 million eggs come through
this packing plant every year.


516
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,000
Most of them come from farms that
are less than 30 miles away.


517
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,320
It's a huge hi-tech operation.


518
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,080
But in this story, it's not the egg,
but the chicken that comes first.


519
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,960
That's because all the eggs come
from free-range chickens.


520
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,120
But just what does it take to be
free range?


521
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,320
Well, these beauties
must be free to roam,


522
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,440
with at least an acre
for every 800 hens.


523
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,440
Like these girls in here.


524
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,160
There aren't any cages,


525
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,720
just water, food and a lot of room
to move around.


526
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,160
It might look a little bit packed


527
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,480
but they do have the option
to go outside.


528
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,400
They just don't always choose
to do that.


529
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,760
That's because of nurture,
rather than nature.


530
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,400
The chicken is a descendent
of the Red Junglefowl,


531
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,520
originally from northeast India
and southern China.


532
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,240
They are happiest in the protective
cover the jungle provides.


533
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,120
So, that's where these come in.


534
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,280
Should I hold the tree?
I'll hold it, how about that?


535
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,560
We are essentially trying
to create a jungle, is that right?


536
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,280
Not exactly a jungle but yes,
the principle of a jungle.


537
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,840
And why are you doing that?


538
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,560
It's to improve the welfare
of the hens.


539
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,480
To try and de-stress them
a little bit.


540
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:48,200
Have you found any results yet,
are these chickens enjoying having
more trees to roam around?


541
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,440
There doesn't seem to be a lot of
feather pecking going on,


542
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,680
which is a sign that they are
not stressed, are contented
and generally quite happy.


543
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,640
Feather pecking being
they peck each other.


544
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,880
They peck the feathers
out of each other.


545
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,640
It's not something
we've got a problem with.


546
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,720
This isn't just a scheme dreamt up
by Patricia,


547
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,920
free-range egg producers
across Cumbria


548
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,600
are planting trees to provide
happier habitats for their hens.


549
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,480
It's backed up by scientists
and big egg buyers, too.


550
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,600
Joy Clachan is a farmer
and a scientist.


551
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,000
Her research is part of
a nationwide study


552
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,120
backed by one of the biggest
purchasers of free-range eggs,
McDonald's.


553
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,360
Our research found they feel at home
in this environment.


554
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,720
It provides everything they need,


555
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,000
the shade, the shelter,
the protection.


556
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,520
As you can see, the birds
absolutely love it


557
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,760
and express so much
natural behaviour.


558
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,000
And is it not -
sorry to sound cynical -


559
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,720
a PR exercise for McDonald's?


560
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,000
Not at all, no.
For us, it's about proving


561
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,800
that commitment
to improving animal welfare.


562
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,240
Working in collaboration with
our suppliers and their producers.


563
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,920
The egg explosion in Cumbria is a
triumph that came from adversity.


564
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:13,040
The county was one of the worst hit
by the outbreak of foot and mouth
ten years ago.


565
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,640
It forced many livestock farmers,
like Patricia, into a rethink.


566
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,640
We decided we needed to think about
other options


567
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,960
so we didn't have all our eggs
in one basket


568
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,720
and we decided to look into another
means of farming,


569
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,480
and this was what we decided on.


570
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,400
How many hens do you have now?
10,500.


571
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,560
And you started with?
4,000 in the first year.


572
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,360
And we liked it so much
that we decided to expand.


573
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,960
Once collected, the eggs from
Patricia and 37 other farms


574
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,080
from all over Cumbria
come through here.


575
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,240
It's a hi-tech operation. Owner Dave
Brass is giving me a guided tour.


576
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,960
This is where the eggs come in.


577
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,080
This machine takes
a picture of the eggs,


578
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,280
it also senses which way round
the egg is,


579
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,560
because we want to put the eggs
into the egg box point down.


580
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,960
Do any eggs ever break?
It's going very fast, this machine.


581
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,720
In half a million eggs a day,
we lose maybe a couple of dozen.


582
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,480
Next piece of equipment is
a crack detector.


583
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,160
There are a lot of little
hammers in there,


584
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,440
and they hit the eggshell very
gently and listen to the echo.


585
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,520
Now, the machine, the computer,
knows where every faulty egg is
and every good egg is.


586
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,200
This is the bee's knees,
state-of-the-art machinery.


587
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,280
We use car-building robots to
put eggs in boxes.


588
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,520
If all eggs in this country were
produced in a free-range way,


589
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,520
would there be enough eggs
for the whole country?


590
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,880
In theory, yes.


591
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,160
You got to remember that
free range takes land,


592
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,480
and an area the size of Dorset
would be required for all of that.


593
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,160
So it's fitting that within
the rest of agriculture in the UK.


594
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,320
While the egg-packing technology
may be thoroughly modern,


595
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,400
it's thanks to ancient,
Asian ancestors,


596
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,160
that the egg producers of Cumbria
are giving their hens


597
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,640
a free-range future.


598
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,680
It's TB testing time again
on Adam's farm.


599
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,480
It's a moment
all cattle farmers dread,


600
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,720
but will Adam get the all clear
this time?


601
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,160
Today is a big day for us
on the farm.


602
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,240
We're TB testing.


603
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,880
We've gone clear now for 10 months,


604
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,000
and today is our
routine six-monthly test.


605
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,880
And usually, when the cattle have
been out at grass all summer,


606
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,600
we go down with TB again, so, I don't
feel that optimistic, to be honest.


607
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,480
And I've got good reason to worry.


608
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,400
I've lost more than 70 cattle to
this disease in the past 10 years.


609
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,840
These are my beautiful
White Park cattle,


610
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,720
the herd was really depleted
because of TB.


611
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,480
We were down to three cows.


612
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,960
So I went to Devon and bought seven
new White Park heifers.


613
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,040
They've all calved now and
it looks like a really lovely herd,
I'm really proud of them.


614
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,080
But I heard some very worrying news
the other day.


615
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,000
The farmer in Devon where I got the
cattle from had his routine TB test.


616
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,880
He hadn't had TB for two years,
he had 20 reactors.


617
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,040
20 animals that had to be
slaughtered.


618
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,960
So today, this herd,
I'm very, very nervous about.


619
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,120
Although the cattle were tested
before leaving Devon,


620
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,800
you can never be 100% sure
they're disease-free.


621
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,480
Cattle are creatures of routine,
and on TB testing days,


622
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,800
we're stirring them up,
moving them around,


623
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,120
there's bulls around that get upset,
they start roaring at one another.


624
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,240
And the cows are already
worried about their calves.


625
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,400
And I feel pretty stirred up as well.


626
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,360
Not an easy day.


627
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,960
White Parks are classed as
a minority breed,


628
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,560
and I've worked hard to help
conserve them.


629
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,280
Losing any would be a disaster.


630
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,800
So, as the vet arrives,
it's time to start the test.


631
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,000
And then, straightaway...


632
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,400
Reactor?


633
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,240
This is one of the cows
that we bought from the farm


634
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,920
down in Devon, and she's a reactor.


635
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,720
First cow of the test,
and she's reacted.


636
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,720
It's an absolute travesty.
Complete disaster.


637
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,920
'This one isn't looking good either.'


638
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,480
It's another one, Adam.
It's another one?


639
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,520
That's a new one too, isn't it?


640
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,200
Yeah. Oh, no!


641
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,000
You try and try
and build up your herd again,


642
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,240
and you've got to buy in cattle
if your herd is almost depleted.


643
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,640
We've always bred
our own replacements.


644
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,600
And what have we done?


645
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,280
We've either given them TB
when they got here


646
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,360
or we've re-infected our herd.


647
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,480
This is something my dad has seen
many times before,


648
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,400
and it doesn't get any easier.


649
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,640
Today,
this is just a total disaster,


650
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:24,560
I mean, to get two so far, out
of the new heifers, is just awful.


651
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,040
And I just don't know how
we're going to go on.
HE SIGHS


652
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,280
I feel terribly guilty, I may have
reintroduced TB to my farm.


653
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,480
What can you do?


654
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,280
To make matters worse, these two
White Parks are suckling calves


655
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,600
and that leaves me
with a bit of a dilemma.


656
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,920
It's a tricky situation with the
calves, because they haven't got TB,


657
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,440
and we can decide to
keep them on the farm and rear them


658
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,240
or we can have them slaughtered,


659
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,960
because they may be
at risk of carrying it.


660
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,600
And I can't make my mind up
at the moment,


661
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,800
I'm afraid I can't think straight.


662
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,160
So now, these animals that have
reacted to TB have to be tagged


663
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,960
and they take a sample of skin
from their ear which is the DNA
of that animal,


664
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,640
to stop any
higgery-jiggery-pokery with the tags,


665
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,920
to make sure that the animal
that's got TB goes to slaughter.


666
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,400
All looks well for the rest
of my White Parks,


667
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,520
until one of my original herd
gets tested.


668
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,440
This is one of our home-bred cows.


669
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,840
A heifer
who's running with the bull now.


670
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,840
Reactor.


671
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Another one? Yeah.


672
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,800
She hasn't been with
the visiting cows for very long,


673
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,200
only the last couple of weeks.


674
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,400
And strangely, it makes me feel
a bit better that we had it anyway,


675
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,840
so we haven't introduced it to the
farm by bringing cattle with us,


676
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,320
it's just on the farm
and it seems like it's here to stay.


677
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,840
But we've lost another White Park.


678
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,280
All right.


679
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,240
Watch the calf. Mind the calf!


680
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,320
The vet doesn't find any more
reactors among the rest of my cattle,


681
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,040
but there are a couple
that are borderline.


682
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,880
This animal has got lumps,
but they're not big enough


683
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,720
to make it a reactor, it's what's
known as an inconclusive.


684
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,720
And so she will have to be tested
again in 60 days,


685
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,400
but like the rest of the herd
will be. Yeah.


686
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,960
All that's left now
are the last few of my highlands.


687
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,440
It's not often I have favourites,


688
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,600
but Eric has got a real place
in my heart now.


689
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,800
If he got TB and had to be put down,
that would bring a tear to my eye.


690
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,680
And thankfully,
it's good news for Eric.


691
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,720
Yes!


692
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,360
I'm not alone when it comes to
the terrible effects of this disease.


693
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,440
Last year, around 25,000 cattle
were slaughtered


694
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,960
due to bovine TB in England.


695
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,760
It cost us taxpayers
around £90 million.


696
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,920
The Government is currently
deliberating on whether


697
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,240
to sanction a badger cull in England
to control the disease.


698
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,960
'A solution, whatever it might be,
can't come soon enough for me.'


699
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,480
Right, so that's it,
the test is over,


700
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,480
we've got three reactors
that will have to be slaughtered,


701
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,840
and two are what are known as
inconclusives.


702
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,840
They'll have to be tested again
before a decision


703
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,040
can be made on them.
So, it's a real shame.


704
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,320
I was really hoping that
we were shot of it now.


705
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,760
We've gone 10 months clear of TB
and the animals have been


706
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,400
out at grass grazing all summer,
and they've got it again.


707
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,040
So we go on this continual circle.


708
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,160
After some time
away from the animals,


709
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,600
I've had a chance to think about
the reality of the results


710
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,400
and I've decided what to do
with my White Park calves.


711
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,280
I've isolated these three cows
that reacted to the TB test.


712
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,880
They have to be isolated to stop
the risk of them


713
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,360
spreading TB to the other cattle
that are healthy,


714
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,720
and they'll be slaughtered
in 7 to 10 days' time.


715
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,800
One of the dilemmas I've got now
is that these two cows have got


716
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,560
two calves that they're suckling,
and there's a risk that these calves


717
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,840
might have TB, so do I just decide to
put them down, to slaughter them?


718
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,520
Or do I rear them by hand-feeding
them bottled milk


719
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,720
and have them in a loose box to stop
the risk of spreading TB to many of
my other cattle?


720
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,560
And they're such lovely
little calves,


721
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,760
I think I've got to give them
a chance and I hope


722
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,520
the outcome is positive,


723
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,600
that these calves will survive
and get through the next TB test


724
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,240
and I will be able to return them
to the herd as healthy animals.


725
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,320
Next week, I'll be visiting
the shortlisted farms


726
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,000
for this year's Farmer Of The Year


727
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,760
as part of Radio Four's annual
Food And Farming Awards.


728
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,720
This is the high country,
the roof of England.


729
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:29,520
Where craggy mountains meet
vast open moorland.


730
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,880
And where market towns
touch the clouds.


731
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,000
Like this one. Alston
is one of England's highest,


732
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,320
we're 1,000 feet up and more
than 15 miles from the next town.


733
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,120
If it's remoteness you want,
you've got it.


734
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,960
There's been a settlement here
since Roman times,


735
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,880
those boys on day trips


736
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,760
from Hadrian's Wall
knew they were on to something.


737
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,080
Because the area around Alston
is loaded.


738
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,360
It's not so much a case of
there's gold in them there hills,


739
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,400
as zinc and silver
and most important of all, lead.


740
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,320
Lead is what put the area
on the map.


741
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,120
Mines sprung up all over the place,
and if you know where to look,


742
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,160
you can read its history
in the hillsides.


743
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,600
Even just looking at this bit
of the landscape,


744
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,720
you can tell that it's quite
a heavily mined area, can't you?


745
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,600
Yes, this whole top end
of the valley


746
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,440
is scarred, even where there are
bits that have been grassed over.


747
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,680
Right the way up to the top
and around the corner,


748
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,120
it's all lead workings
going back 300 years or more,


749
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,840
and you can see the landscape
hasn't recovered.


750
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,720
All that brown waste, it's all
waste heaps there, and the place


751
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,720
is practically hollow with
the amount of lead that's
been taken out.


752
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,160
Miners flocked to the area,
the population exploded,


753
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,640
but there was nowhere for them
to live.


754
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,320
Solution - build homes,
lots of them.


755
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,400
These were wonderful houses
by the standards of the day.


756
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,720
Although it was just one room up,
one room down,


757
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,800
for a family of up to 10 or 11,


758
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,240
it was much better than anything
the workers had been used to,


759
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,600
and they had outhouses
at the back and toilets,


760
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,720
and they had large gardens
in the front


761
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,600
where they were encouraged to
produce their own vegetables,


762
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,560
just for the sake of getting
fresh air and exercise after


763
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,000
being cooped up in the mine all day
in the pitch black and the dust.


764
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,040
They could come and be out
in the sunshine, would you believe,
and be healthy.


765
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:29,480
Even so, a miner's life expectancy
was just 45 years of age,


766
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,680
and most of that would have been
spent underground.


767
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,520
To find out what life
was like down there,


768
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,040
I'm joining a team of local
mine explorers.


769
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,560
Alistair, it's a lovely, sunny day,
yet we're going underground.
Is it going to be worth it?


770
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,360
It certainly will be,
there's a lot to see down there,


771
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,640
so, once we're kitted up,
we can make our way in.


772
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,480
OK. Boiler suit on, helmet on,
are we ready, team?


773
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,080
Lead the way, Alistair.


774
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,000
These old mines can be dangerous, so
it pays to have experts guide you,


775
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,480
but once you're in,
a whole new world opens up.


776
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,680
There are beautiful
dry stone tunnels.


777
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,280
You can still see the rails
used to wheel out the lead ore.


778
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,360
Here and there,
pit props hold up the roof.


779
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:25,240
But mostly, it's narrow passages,
blasted out of the hard rock,


780
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,800
flooded and dark.


781
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,200
But shine a light,
and the space glitters.


782
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,840
The miners weren't down here
for the views though.


783
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,160
They were working eight-hour shifts
in pairs.


784
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,040
It was hard graft and slow going.


785
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,960
Alastair, these are everywhere.
Are these sort of drill marks?


786
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,560
Yes, the miners would've drilled
in here by hand
in this part of the mine.


787
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,840
Once the drill hole was complete,
they'd put gunpowder into the hole,


788
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,360
pack it with clay,
and then put a fuse in.


789
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,520
When the rock was blasted,
it blasted this piece of rock away,


790
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,800
and leaves the drill hole there.


791
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,160
They'd blast about two foot a day.


792
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,520
It could take years to reach
the veins of lead ore,


793
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,360
but if they struck it rich
they'd work around the clock,


794
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,160
and all they had to work by
was candlelight.


795
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:35,160
You can see on the wall there, can
you see the dollop of clay? Yes.


796
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,120
That's what the miners would've used
for their candles.


797
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,400
They'd put the clay on the wall and
then stick a candle in as a holder,


798
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,880
and that allowed them to work hands
free and see what they were doing.


799
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,440
So the candle was
their only form of light?


800
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,040
Only form of light, yes.
One candle per miner.


801
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,520
What's this bit?
It's totally different, isn't it?


802
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,320
This is known as
a horse whim chamber,


803
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,400
and when the mines were working
there's a shaft on the far side there


804
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,000
that goes down to lower levels,
and there would be a pony walking
round in here,


805
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,720
driving a winching system that would
haul material up and down
the whimsey shaft.


806
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,800
Is this machinery?
Was that often used?


807
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,040
Yes, this is the remains
of the actual winching system.


808
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,040
So that stuff is
potentially 300 years old?


809
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,640
Yep, yep.
Original timber and materials there.


810
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,560
A time capsule, albeit
a little rusty and rotten now.


811
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,160
We've been going nearly an hour


812
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:45,400
and still no sign of the galena,
the valuable lead ore that kept
so many miners busy.


813
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,160
But it is there,
you just need a keen eye.


814
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,000
So this is it, is it?
This is what they were looking for?


815
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,880
I've got a sample here.
That's the actual galena itself


816
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,600
so you can see when it's first
exposed it's quite shiny.


817
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,560
It's really quite gorgeous,
isn't it?


818
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,080
It does have a certain percentage of
silver within it as well,


819
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,760
which helped make the mines
profitable in the area.


820
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,280
There's still plenty of lead ore
here, it just became uneconomic
to mine it.


821
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:20,280
Cheaper foreign lead put paid to our
home-grown industry at the start of
the 20th century.


822
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,240
An industry which had flourished
since Roman times had gone.


823
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,120
You could spend hours down there
and you might get lost


824
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,240
but you definitely
wouldn't get bored.


825
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,560
Shortly, I'm going to be sharpening
my shepherding skills with the help
of a few experts,


826
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,120
and fingers crossed it'll be enough
to beat Matt in the sheepdog trials.


827
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:45,440
But, before that,
here's the Countryfile
weather forecast for the week ahead.


828
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:57,040
.


829
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:17,200
This is the North Country,
where the Pennines rub up against
the Lake District.


830
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,480
Hidden between the two
is the Eden Valley,


831
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,040
my home and host to this year's
World Sheepdog Championships.


832
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,760
I'm here to take on Matt in a
sheepdog championship of our own.


833
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,800
Matt is very proud of his farming
heritage, but so am I,


834
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,760
and I know he likes to think
of himself as a bit of a dab hand
when it comes to handling sheep.


835
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,640
I, however, have no experience
handling sheep.


836
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,680
That's why I'm calling on you, Mark.
You're my guru for this,


837
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:50,000
because I'm throwing down the
gauntlet to Baker on my home turf
so I've got to win.


838
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,920
We'll do our best.
Come on!


839
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,000
I've enlisted the help of local
farmer Mark Elliott.


840
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,960
Together with his trusty dog Spot,
he's one of this year's
hot favourites.


841
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,320
To get him to come over,
I say, "that'll do"?
"That'll do, Spot", yes.


842
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,880
That'll do, Spot.


843
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,400
Be a bit more assertive.


844
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,200
That'll do, Spot!
That'll do, Spot. Spot! That'll do.


845
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,320
That'll do, Spot.


846
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,240
That'll do, Spot. Good lad.


847
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,240
He's not really listening to me,
is he? No!


848
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:21,400
'One word from me...and Spot does
just what he wants!'


849
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,200
How do I get him to go right?


850
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,120
The basic ones - for the right
hand side it's "way". Way.


851
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,960
And for the left
it's "come bye". OK.


852
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,720
Come bye.


853
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,480
That'll do. That'll do.


854
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,040
Come bye. Come bye.


855
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,760
Sit! Ask him for the way. Way!


856
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,720
'Hmm, this could take some doing.


857
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,640
'Luckily, Mark's going to be
right by my side for the showdown.'


858
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,440
Lie down, lie down!
That's it!


859
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,640
Spot, that'll do.


860
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:08,600
Right, let battle commence.
May the best presenter win
and never mind the weather.


861
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,920
Come on, Spot. Here we go.
How are you doing, Helen? All right?


862
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,320
I'm very good. You're fully trained
up then, I understand?
I'm good. Well, I say that.


863
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,160
You've had a lot of training,
I hear? Well, not with this dog
unfortunately.


864
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:26,640
My dog Meg is no longer with me
so I borrowed Tim from a good friend
of mine, Gus Dermody,


865
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,160
and not only have I borrowed his
dog, I've borrowed his outfit
as well


866
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,000
because the weather
has taken a turn for the worst.
So Gus is a judge...


867
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,400
You're literally
in the judge's pocket?


868
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,280
Yes, absolutely. Actually,
can I borrow your crook as well?
Yes, you can have that.


869
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,200
I'm fully kitted out now.
Right, well we're ready for this.
Aren't we, Mark? Yes.


870
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,440
Right. Spot is poised.


871
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,680
Will Spot listen to you,
do you think? Because I've got
no idea about Tim.


872
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,800
Apparently Spot isn't too familiar
to the female voice.


873
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,680
Right. So Mark's going to walk with
me and echo what I say.


874
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,640
You're just going to talk like that.
No problem. OK!


875
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:05,920
But there is a problem because
we'll be lucky if the dogs can hear
anything we say over this weather.


876
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,200
I'm hoping I've got beginner's luck.


877
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,240
An expert in the field, Matt's
first to take on the course.


878
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,640
Pretty wide around the pen here.


879
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,160
Tim! You've got to keep them
flowing all the time. Lie down.


880
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,080
'It sounds simple - get five sheep
through a gate and into a pen -


881
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,920
'but these girls are stubborn
customers.'


882
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,760
So through the obstacle, bearing
right, and now they need to head for
the pen. Lie down. Lie down!


883
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,680
Yep, he's got them in the pen.
Oh, well done!


884
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,160
Yay! Good boy.


885
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,680
What a good lad! Steady!


886
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,000
Not a bad start for Helen and Spot.


887
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,120
Oh, we've gone wrong. Way. Way.
That's not too bad. The dog's going
the wrong side.


888
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,320
He's keen, isn't he?
Come bye, you.


889
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,840
Good control there,
keeping the ship nice and calm.


890
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,360
Lie down. Lie down.


891
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,640
Go on.


892
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,280
Lie down, lie down.


893
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,920
Oh! It's a clean pen.
It's a very good pen.


894
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,680
Well, I thought that was impressive.
Very. Very good.


895
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,280
I certainly was impressed.
My word! Helen, what are you doing
on this field?


896
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,640
You should be up there, competing!


897
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,680
I think it's fair to say
I had a very good teacher who
chipped in now and again.


898
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,080
OK! To be honest, we could have
left Spot to his own devices.


899
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,520
He was quite happy out there
on his own. Brilliant.


900
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,120
He thoroughly enjoyed it. Look,
the sheep are sticking around. They
want to know who's won.


901
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,560
Gus, what's the result?


902
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,400
Really, you were level pegging,
but on a technicality you got it


903
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,320
because Helen went and moved
from the post, from the pen
when you set the dog off.


904
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,960
What?!
Yep, unfortunately for you...


905
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,680
That's a made-up rule,
I didn't even know about it!


906
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,600
Thanks ever so much. That's
all we've got time for this week.


907
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,400
Con-gratu-lations!


908
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,320
Next week we're going to be
in the Mawddach estuary in Wales


909
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,160
and we'll be revealing your
favourite entry of the Countryfile
photographic competition.


910
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,680
But, from Helen's neck of the woods,
it's come by for now. See you.


911
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,200
You looked so cool until that gag.


912
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,560
It's undermined the victory!
