你可以同时解开他的脚镯

101
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:49,708
和包皮

No, it gets cold in the winter. What about the basement?

# 更无须停滞不前 #
And I don't have to stay this way

152
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,246
# 但愿我会等待 #
If only I would wait

153
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:43,686
# 在困难中迷失自己 #
I could have lost myself in rough

154

他们认为是我的妈妈

160

Well, maybe you should let your mom keep him for awhile.

165

至少直到你确定

你不会改变主意了

我不会改变主意了

Yeah, but you don't know that. I mean, you could really...

169
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:37,235
我才不要碰那个东西呢 好不好
I don't want that fucking thing anywhere near me, okay?

170
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:45,075
去问问我什么时候能离开这鬼地方
Go ask somebody when I can get the hell out of here.

吉米 他现在是吉米了
Jimmy. His name's Jimmy now.

180
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:23,247
史蒂夫只是他以前对我
Steve was just an alias he used

181
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:25,115
隐瞒身份的时候用的化名
to lie to me about who he really was.

182
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,750
噢 不太好哦 吉米-史蒂夫
Ooh, not cool, Jimmy-Steve.

183
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:28,852
- 要鸡蛋不 - 我要拿着走
- Eggs? - To go.

184
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,287
我改名是因为当时
I changed my name 'cause I was

185
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:31,755
我在偷卡 万一出了什么事
stealing cars. Didn't want anyone to

186
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:33,323
我可不想被查出来
be able to track me down if things went south.

187
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:34,624
跟你可没有任何关系
It didn't have anything to do with you.

188

00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:32,224
他们现在会做脑叶切除术
They perform lobotomies now.

284
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:33,258
才不是呢
No, they don't.

285
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,160
- 电击治疗 - 没这回事
- Shock treatment? - No.

286
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,262
其实 我觉得有吧 莉亚公主就试过啊
Actually, I think they do. Princess Leia did it.

287
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:39,898
100,000伏的电
100,000 volts of electricity

288
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:41,800
穿过她的头颅
zapped into her skull!

289
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:45,804
要用好多的能量 整个城市都得停电
Draws so much power, it takes out entire city blocks.

290
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:47,239
我们的灯变暗的时候
When our lights dim, some poor fucker's

291
00:20:47,273 --> 00:20:48,440
可怜虫们正在被人烧脑子呢
getting his brains fried.

292
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:49,574
别听他的 卡尔
Don't listen to him, Carl.

293
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:50,575
吃你的早餐吧
Eat your breakfast.

294
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,910
脑叶切除是什么
What's a lobotomy?

295
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:53,145
他们把一个东西塞进你脑子里
They jam a screwdriver

296
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:54,913
然后使劲乱绞
into your head and scramble your brains.

297
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:56,816
才不是这样的 哎呀 弗兰克
No, they don't. Jesus, Frank.

298
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,517
- 是真的啊 - 他们会让妈继续
- Yeah, they do! - They're gonna put Mom

299
00:20:58,551 --> 00:20:59,918
吃药 会让她好起来的
back on her meds. They're gonna make her better.

300
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:01,954
吃药对她可没好处
She's not better on her meds.

301
00:21:01,988 --> 00:21:04,958
她就是个空壳 她把生命里所爱的一切都丢掉了
She's a zombie. She gives up everything she loves in life.

302
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:07,928
哦 丢掉了什么 毒品 酒精 你
Yeah, like what? Drugs, alcohol, you?

303
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:09,363
我们
Us.

304
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:16,170
在他们把她变得不像她之前
I'm gonna bust her out of there

305
00:21:16,204 --> 00:21:17,838
我要把她弄出来
before they steal what makes Monica Monica.

306
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:18,839
你到底支不支持我
Are you with me?

307
00:21:18,874 --> 00:21:20,041
就让她呆在那里吧 弗兰克
Leave her alone, Frank.

308
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:22,543
她需要抓住机会好起来
She needs a chance to get well.

309
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:23,945
别人能把你变成其他人
Somebody can steal what makes you you?

310
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:25,680
不能 卡尔
No. Carl?

311
00:21:25,714 --> 00:21:27,215
他也不站在你这边
He's not helping you, either.

312
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:28,816
我能拿上我的Mac-10手枪吗
Can I bring my Mac-10 pistol?

313
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:30,518
别把他扯进去 枪你得交给
Leave him out of this. The pistol's going back

314
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:31,953
- 警察 - 你姐姐呢
- to the cops. - Where's your sister?

315
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:34,188
洗澡呢
Shower.

316
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:36,191
- 别拉上黛比 弗兰克 - 不
- Leave Debbie alone, Frank! - No.

317
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:40,496
莫妮卡如果从医院出来以后会好很多的 卡尔
Monica will be better when she comes out of the hospital, Carl.

318
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,699
我通过了
I passed.

319
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,735
学业考试 我通过了
The GED-- I passed.

320
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,210
老爸
Daddy!

321
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:55,479
老爸 你应该敲门的啊
Daddy, you're supposed to knock!

322
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:58,014
你爱不爱你妈妈
Do you love your mother?

323
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:00,684
辛迪说这东西是给那些不能
Cindy says they make this thing for women who can't produce

324
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:02,252
产奶的女性做的
their own milk.

325
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,921
把这玩意儿挂在脖子上
You hang this doohickey around your neck,

326
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:10,894
然后把这些
and then you tape these right over

327
00:22:10,928 --> 00:22:12,162
贴在乳头上
your nipples.

328
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:14,565
这样就可以"母乳喂养"婴儿了
And the baby can still breast-feed.

329
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,267
算了吧 亲爱的 我能搞定
It's okay, honey, I-I can do it.

330
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,204
不是啊 我们两个人都得和他有亲密的关系 很重要的
No, it's important for both of us to bond with him.

331
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,275
好吧
Okay.

332
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,310
好
Okay.

333
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,348
来吧 孩子
There, sweet boy.

334
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:38,255
真是 啊
That's... Whoa.

335
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:42,559
现在我可体会到这种感觉了
Now I know what all the fuss is about.

336
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:46,696
有人来了
Someone's here. Oh.

337
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,065
妈
Mom?

338
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,368
妈
Mom.

339
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:56,038
亲爱的
Sweetie!

340
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:58,107
天啊 这么快就回来啦
My goodness! Home already?

341
00:22:58,141 --> 00:23:01,043
医院让你走了吗
Did the hospital let you leave?

342
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:02,278
它在哪里
Where is it?

343
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:03,880
他们不是至少得让你
Thought they usually like to keep you

344
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:06,116
- 多呆几天吗 - 它在哪里啊 妈
- for at least a day. - Where is it, Mom?

345
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,951
什么在哪里 宝贝
Where's what, honey?

346
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,587
它
It.

347
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,289
昨晚用大脑袋在我身体里
The baby that shoved its ginormous head

348
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,892
挤来挤去挤了六个小时的那个婴儿
out of my cooter for six endless hours last night.

349
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,260
哇 他们把他给弄丢了
Oh, my. Did they lose it?

350
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:19,730
他们给我看了个录像 是你拿走了
They showed me the video footage of you taking it.

351
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,268
- 哦 那个小孩啊 - 他们本来想报警的
- Oh, that baby. - They were gonna call

352
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,069
我说算了
the police, but I said no.

353
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:28,972
它在哪儿
Where is it?

354
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,877
- 快说啊 妈 - 在烘干机里
- Now, Mom! - In the dryer.

355
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:42,121
拿出来
Take it out.

356
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:43,355
他好像还在午睡
I think he's napping.

357
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,624
快拿出来
Take it out!

358
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:45,992
我不想碰那东西
I don't want to touch it!

359
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:50,196
你在漏奶
You're leaking.

360
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:57,637
多漂亮的孩子
Isn't he beautiful?

361
00:23:57,671 --> 00:23:59,038
送它回医院吧
Take it back to the hospital.

362
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:00,506
会有人想要它的
Somebody will want it.

363
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,375
我要它
I want it.

364
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:03,709
我不答应
Well, you can't have it.

365
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:06,646
他是个特别乖的宝宝
He's such a sweet boy.

366
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,215
从不哭闹
He never cries.

367
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:11,150
长得又漂亮
He's so handsome.

368
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:13,152
我们想给他起你祖父的名字
We want to name him Hiram

369
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:14,887
叫他希拉姆
after your grandfather.

370
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,689
或者叫明 让他保持中国特色
Or maybe Ming, to keep him wired into his Chinese-ness.

371
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:20,159
乔迪你闭嘴
Shut up, Jody.

372
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:22,227
必须送它回去
It's going back.

373
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:25,297
凯伦 别这样
Karen, please don't do this.

374
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:28,300
随便他们把它送去哪儿 弱智呆的疯人院之类的
They'll give it to the retarded freaks' home or whatever.

375
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,335
他是我的外孙
He's my grandson.

376
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,705
我不会让你像扔掉张废纸一样
I won't let you throw him away

377
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,841
扔掉他的
like used Kleenex.

378
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,543
凯伦 或许你妈妈说的没错
You know, Karen, your mom might be right.

379
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,311
是该让她养一段日子
Maybe she should keep him for a while.

380
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:40,846
谁知道
You know, who knows

381
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:42,882
社工们会对他做些什么
what social services is going to do with him?

382
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,317
没你的事儿 利普
Butt out, Lip!

383
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:45,551
你呆这儿是想干嘛
What are you even doing here?

384
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:46,819
他都不是你的种
He's not even yours.

385
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,554
这事儿和你半毛钱关系都没有
This is none of your goddamn business.

386
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,489
至少给蒂姆王或者别的谁的那个爹打个电话
At least call Tim Wong or whoever the father is

387
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:51,724
告诉他一声
and tell him about it.

388
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,826
滚
Get out!

389
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:00,833
你被这娘们甩了
You dodged a fucking RPG

390
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,103
那才真是走大运了
getting tossed over by this one.

391
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:05,371
可不是吗 哥们
Don't I know it, man.

392
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:08,074
送它回医院
Take it back to the hospital.

393
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:09,675
要是医院不收怎么办
What if they won't take it back?

394
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,077
那就放篮子里
Then drop it in a basket

395
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:12,344
扔消防队门口
and leave it at the fire station.

396
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,579
我不在乎
I don't give a shit.

397
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:15,514
不
No.

398
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:17,949
不要
No.

399
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,450
就要
Yes!

400
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,553
他就留在我身边
He is staying with me.

401
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,989
行啊
Fine!

402
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,626
那我就去报警了
Then I'm calling the police.

403
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:57,486
利普在吗
Lip here?

404
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,121
利普
Lip!

405
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,202
是你姐
It's your sister.

406
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:18,475
话说
So...

407
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:22,979
你怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

408
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:25,281
吉米说的
Jimmy.

409
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,420
凯伦怎么样了
How's Karen?

410
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:32,855
那娘们真是个贱人
Girl's a fucking bitch.

411
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:34,524
我表亲 叫艾丽
My cousin, Eli, was born

412
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:36,259
出生的时候一个脚丫长膝盖上
with a foot coming out of his knee.

413
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:37,527
现在他是个铁匠
Now he's a blacksmith.

414
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,596
使起风箱来都不带用手拉的
Only one who can pump the bellows

415
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,599
比谁都牛
without using his hands.

416
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:45,971
我自考过了
I passed my GED.

417
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,309
别一脸不相信的样子
Don't look so surprised.

418
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:51,844
我没有
No, I'm not.

419
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:54,580
那真是 真是太好了
That's, um...that's great.

420
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,688
说好的不能不算
So... deal's a deal.

421
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:04,156
太迟了
Ah, too late.

422
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,158
- 覆水难收了 - 我过了考试
- Spilt milk. - I passed.

423
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,326
- 你就回去念书 - 泼出去的水了
- You go back to school. - Water under the bridge.

424
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,294
少来这套
Knock off the clichés.

425
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,930
过了这个村了
Road not taken.

426
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,737
我希望你能回家 利普
I want you home, Lip.

427
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:22,206
大家都是
We all do.

428
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,517
好吧
Right.

429
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:52,233
那里只有冷水 还不让睡觉
It's cold water and sleep deprivation.

430
00:27:52,268 --> 00:27:53,601
在生殖器上缠上电极
Make you stand all day

431
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:55,670
一站就是一整天
with electrodes tied to your genitals.

432
00:27:55,704 --> 00:27:58,239
我觉得你说的不像是县医院 倒像是阿比格莱比监狱
I think you're mistaking Cook County for Abi Grabie.

433
00:27:58,274 --> 00:28:00,108
- 是阿布格莱底 - 阿布格莱布
- Abu Gradie. - Abu Ghraib.

434
00:27:58,274 --> 00:28:00,108
伊拉克监狱 曾出过美军虐囚丑闻

435
00:28:00,142 --> 00:28:02,578
有个守卫带我去绕过一圈 在巴士拉那会儿
Did a tour with the Guard-- Basra.

436
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:04,413
他们不虐囚 弗兰克
They don't do any of that, Frank.

437
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:05,715
我去年上那儿呆过
I was in there last year

438
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:07,350
就是我不当心嗑药过量那次
after my accidental overdose.

439
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,753
不当心 你那次吸可卡因的时候都把自己给点着了
Accidental? You set yourself on fire freebasing.

440
00:28:09,787 --> 00:28:12,689
基本上就是大家坐成一圈
It was mostly us sitting in a circle

441
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,693
说说自己是怎么被
in a group talking about how your family

442
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,394
- 家人毁了的 - 莫妮卡聊起弗兰克
- screwed you up. -  Oh, Monica talking about Frank?

443
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,629
可是得花上一会儿
That ought to take a while.

444
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,132
弗兰克 你带钱了吗
Frank, you got any cash?

445
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,301
钞票 票子
Moolah? Green?

446
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,736
我必须把她从那儿弄出来
I got to spring her out of there.

447
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,771
我俩就像阴阳两仪
She's the yin to my yang.

448
00:28:28,805 --> 00:28:30,406
她就是我苏打水里的威士忌
She's the scotch in my soda.

449
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,908
我俩就是金姐与弗雷 [美国舞王舞后]
We are Fred and Ginger.

450

列侬和洋子 米奇和米妮
John and Yoko. Mickey and Minnie.

451
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:36,979
更像是席格菲与洛依
More like Siegfried and Roy.

452
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:38,514
希特勒和艾娃
Adolf and Eva.

453
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,954
你儿子还是在医院上晚班吗 汤米
Your boy still working nights at the hospital, Tommy?

454
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,324
是啊 支持服务技术员
Support services technician, yeah.

455
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,626
支持服务技术员 不就是个清洁工吗
Support services technician? I thought he was a janitor.

456
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,961
不管怎样是个工作
A job's a job.

457
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,463
至少帕特有工作
At least Pat's got one.

458
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,098
帕蒂几点上班
What time's Patty go to work?

459
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,970
晚上都安排好了

You asked, you got it.

462
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,408
他们上这儿来吗
Are they coming here?

463
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,276
呃 不是
Uh... no.

464
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,178
我爸有日子没离开过市区了
Dad hasn't been south of the Art Institute Gala

465
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,948
最近一次还是84年比利・乔尔在科米斯基公园开演唱会那次
since Billy Joel played Comiskey Park in '84.

466
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,450
- 那去他们家 - 也不是

467

她有洁癖
She's a germophobe.

469
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:18,755
要想从碟子里拿颗杏仁
You want an almond out of the serving dish,

470
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,824
你得带上医用手套拿手术钳夹
you have to wear surgical gloves and use tongs.

471
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:21,958
我见过你妈
I met your mom.

472
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,827

就是黄铜铭牌上
Little brass plaque

481
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,775

You bet.

492
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:18,148
# 扭曲的心灵 #
Bad, bad heart

比死掉妓女的后庭还要难闻
Smells worse than a dead hooker's ass in there.

500
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:41,106
轻点声行吗

是的 但是我不想把他留下来
Yes, but I don't want it here.

And you want a total stranger to take him

551

或是让伊利诺伊斯州
or the State of Illinois to be responsible for him

552
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,460
用纳税人的钱来养他

562
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,030
不行
No.

563
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,650
莫妮卡
Monica?

564
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,850
莫妮卡
Monica?

565
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,430
我可以扮演莫妮卡的
I can be if you want me to be.

566
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,920
老天
Jesus!

567
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:31,680
莫妮卡莫妮卡莫妮卡
Monica? Monica? Monica?

568
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,000
科密特
Kermit?

569
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,460
- 弗兰克 - 你的头是怎么回事
-Frank? -What'd you do to your head?

570
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,710
是我的疗法
Oh, um, my therapy.

571
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,280
对平复神经有好处
It calms my nerves.

572
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,850
你让他们电击你的头了
You let 'em zap your head?

573
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,490
对治我的癫痫病有益
Helps with my seizures.

574
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,470
老天啊
Jesus.

575
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,620
先试试再下定论 弗兰克
Try it before you knock it,Frank.

576
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,610
非常平静
Very restful.

577
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,170
你在这儿见过莫妮卡吗
Have you seen Monica around?

578
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,660
见过 在穿过走廊左拐的地方
Yeah, um... across the hall on your left.

579
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,150
莫妮卡
Monica?

580
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,200
莫妮卡
Monica?

581
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,030
莫妮卡
Hey, Monica?

582
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,670
- 弗兰克 - 我来带你出去的
-Frank. -I came to get you out.

583
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,140
我跟你说过了我不想出去
I told you I don't want out.

584
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,910
你干吗停下
Why'd you stop?

585
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,840
你高潮了吗
Did you come?

586
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,340
弗兰克 这是吉尔
Frank, this is Jill.

587
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,880
吉尔 这是我老公 弗兰克
Jill this is my husband, Frank.

588
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,600
妈妈
Mom?

589
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,040
菲奥娜 菲奥娜 快看
Fiona! Fiona, look!

590
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,170
淘气男孩
Boys.

591
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,570
不好意思 我们平常很少放他出门 卡尔
Sorry. We don't let him out of his cage very often. Carl!

592
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,470
快过来
Get over here.

593
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,840
吉姆 你一直在忙活什么呢
So, Jim, what have you been up to?

594
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,100
仍在想方设法地不求上进吗
Still finding new and creative ways to underachieve?

595
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,510
我最近去南美洲玩了一趟
I was traveling around South America till recently.

596
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,250
老爸的痔疮手术还是你执刀的吗
Are you still handling all the hemorrhoidectomies for Dad?

597
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,550
奇普外科实习完后也加入了老爸的诊所
Chip just joined Dad's practice after his surgical residency,

598
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,540
紧紧跟随父亲的脚步
following in the great man's footsteps.

599
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,900
所以你经常会拿刀切人
So you get to cut into people?

600
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,950
太酷了
Awesome.

601
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,530
他带你去滑过雪吗
He take you skiing yet?

602
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,000
还没呢
Uh, no.

603
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,140
我唯一跟雪扯得上关系的天赋就是
My only talent involving snow is

604
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,500
知道如何将过道上的雪铲除
knowing how to shovel the walk

605
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,200
而不打扰到睡在雪窝里的我父亲
without disturbing my father sleeping on it.

606
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,690
而卡尔最拿手的就是在雪地里尿尿
And Carl's pretty good at peeing in it as well.

607
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:40,300
元旦那天他带去圣莫里茨的那个女孩叫什么名字来着
What was the name of that girl that he took to St. Moritz on New Year's?

608
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,100
克里希 利希 还是什么的
Chrissie? Lizzie?Something.

609
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,260
我记得她的名字是以"希"结尾来着
I remember it had "Ie" On the end of it.

610
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,200
我那年才十七岁
I was 17.

611
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,040
你高中就带女友去欧洲了
You took a girlfriend to Europe in high school?

612
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,270
爸爸赞助的机票
Dad offered a ticket.

613
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,230
他一路把那女孩儿领到了阿尔卑斯山
He drags her all the way to the Alps,

614
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,770
却把人家留在酒店独守空房
then leaves her in the hotel room sitting there

615
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,620
因为他在观光船上又认识了某个法国姑娘
for some French girl he met on the gondola.

616
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,380
奇普 别揪着你弟弟的糗事不放了
Chip, leave your brother alone.

617
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,110
有两件事是可以肯定的
Two things you can count on:

618
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,680
一是我妈对这个小儿子毫不掩饰的偏爱
Mom's naked favoritism for her youngest...

619
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,230
没那回事
That's not true.

620
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,550
我哥还认为我是那个不懂还击的小毛孩
My brother still thinks of me as the runt that didn't punch back.

621
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,200
另一个就是她的小儿子
...and her youngest's quick and stealthy exit

622
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,870
会在弄走她一万块后飞快地偷偷溜走
after he weasels her out of another ten grand.

623
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,010
我这次本打算从她那儿弄走两万
I was hoping to milk her for another 20 this time.

624
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,890
叫奇普的果然都不是什么好东西
With a name like Chip, you'd think you'd want to defy the stereotype.

625
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,940
菲奥娜 别这样 没关系
Fiona, don't. It's fine.

626
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,210
才不是呢
No, it's not.

627
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,340
抱歉来晚了
Well, sorry to be late.

628
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,740
被一个重症病人给耽误了
Whipple on a stage-four patient.

629
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,440
你就是传说中的菲奥娜
So, you are the mysterious Fiona.

630
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,130
这两位是菲奥娜的弟弟 卡尔
And these are Fiona's brothers, Carl...

631
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,550
和伊恩
and Ian...

632
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,720
很高兴认识你 伊恩
Well, nice to meet you, Ian.

633
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,950
我们点好餐了吗
Have we ordered?

634
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,690
不好意思
Excuse me.

635
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,520
去趟洗手间
Bathroom.

636
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,160
- 你的水 先生  - 谢谢
- And your drink, sir. - Thank you.

637
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,300
我得先去洗个手
Ah, you know, I gotta wash my hands.

638
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,460
我要一份生菜沙拉和一份海鲈鱼
I'll have the iceberg lettuce salad and the sea bass.

639
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,480
来一份三分熟的四十八盎司上等双切牛排
Double-cut, 48-ounce prime rib, medium-rare,

640
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,700
和一份两磅的缅因龙虾 谢谢
and the two-pound Maine lobster, please.

641
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,520
他们知道你是同性恋吗
Do they know you're gay?

642
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,730
我不是同性恋
I'm not gay.

643
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,060
是吗 那这算什么呢
Really? What's this then?

644
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,860
想听实话
Honestly?

645
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,410
我这人只要是人就上
Anything that walks, that's me.

646
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,970
天呐 莫妮卡 又搞上一个女人
Jesus, Moni, another lady?

647
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,000
我寂寞如雪
You know, I get lonely.

648
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,630
- 你爱她吗 - 我才认识她
- Do you love her? - I just met her.

649
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,220
你们来这儿干吗
What are you doing here?

650
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,860
我们来帮你逃出去呀
We came to break you out.

651
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,770
我不是跟你说过了吗 我不想出去
I told you, I don't want out.

652
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,180
我想的不得了
Oh, hell, I do.

653
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,490
没人要管你 吉尔
No one's offering, Jill.

654
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,460
你把黛比也拉过来干吗
And why did you have to drag Debbie into this?

655
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,480
如果我一个人来的话 你不会跟我走的
I didn't think you'd come if it was just me.

656
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,920
她怎么被弄进来的
What is she in for?

657
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,270
精神评估 看我能是否上庭受审
Psych evaluation to see if I'm competent to stand trial.

658
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,640
你犯什么事了
What'd you do?

659
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,580
朝我老公开了二十六枪
Shot my husband 26 times.

660
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,550
天呐 你使的什么枪 步枪吗
Jesus, what'd you use, an AK?

661
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,950
手枪
Pistol.

662
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,110
我上了两遍子弹
I reloaded... twice.

663
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,930
莫妮卡 我们希望你在我们身边
Moni, we want you with us.

664
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,960
孩子们需要你
The kids need you.

665
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,650
我需要你
I need you.

666
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,380
痛吗
Does it hurt?

667
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,910
不 我没事
No, I'm okay.

668
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,680
我很抱歉让你目睹那一切 亲爱的
I'm sorry you had to see that, honey.

669
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:40,140
我只是情绪太低落了
I was just so low, you know?

670
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,370
嗯
Yeah.

671
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,620
但是我现在没事
But I'm okay now.

672
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,770
你们打算怎么把我们弄出去呢
What's this grand plan you have for busting us out?

673
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,390
搞定
Got it.

674
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,540
绳子有点短
That's short.

675
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,510
楼真高
That's a long way down.

676
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,310
我们可以把床单接上去
Could tie sheets to the end.

677
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,300
什么
What?!

678
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,850
这里离屋顶只有两层
Hey, it's only two stories down to the roof...

679
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,360
可以从女厕所过去
outside the ladies' john.

680
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,490
要我去把利亚姆接回来吗
You want me to go pick up Liam?

681
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,800
把他留在V那边过夜也没关系的
Uh, V will be okay keeping him overnight.

682
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,140
那饭店真高级 吉米
Great restaurant, Jimmy.

683
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,800
快看我偷来的这把刀
Check out this cool knife I stole.

684
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,330
那玩意儿必须送回去
That's going back.

685
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,950
他们不介意 反正他们多得是
Hey, they won't miss it. They got tons of 'em.

686
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,900
把刀给我 快去睡觉
Give me that. Bed, now.

687
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,950
谁都不准碰我打包带回来的龙虾
Hey, nobody touch my leftover lobster.

688
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,780
我明早要就着我的肉桂烤华夫饼吃了它
I want to put it in my cinnamon toaster waffle in the morning.

689
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,010
嗨 菲奥娜
Hey, Fiona.

690
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,050
吉米的爸爸罗伊德
Jimmy's dad Loyd,

691
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,740

00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,140
晚安
Good night.

693
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,850
晚安
Night.

694
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,860
干嘛
What?

695
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,810
我爱你
I love you.

696
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,090
你会离开我吗
Are you gonna leave?

697
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:56,930
不会
No.

698
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,930
每个人最终都离我而去
Everybody always leaves.

699
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:05,380
我不会的
I won't.

700
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,900
史蒂夫
Steve!

701
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:52,400
史蒂夫
