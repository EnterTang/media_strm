For all of you who were too fucking busy,

送给你们这些太他妈忙的人

为什么那人开走你的车
Why is that man driving your car?

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,804
你就这么让他偷走了
You let him steal it?

5
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:08,672
不 贝托 是我偷的
No, Beto, I stole it,

6

那时我的生活还是多姿多彩的

14

你现在是一脸狗屎
You also have dog shit on your face

15
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,308
无家可归
and no place to live,

16
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:31,210
如果你愿意帮助我们 我们也愿意帮助你

而且你是同性恋 你就承认吧
And you're gay. Just admit it.

21
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:40,691
就这一次 你承认吧
Just this once, admit it. Ugh!

22

Some of the office bitches may have narced on you

25
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:47,493

about the porn at your desk and the personal phone calls.

26
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:49,495

- Am I fired? - No, you're... you're...

28
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:53,669
不管任何理由 你的桌子上不能再出现
No more naked body parts at your desk

29
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:54,901
裸露的人体部位
for any reason.

30
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:56,223

36
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:05,273
我们三个一起
all three of us?

37
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:07,066
下一次我问问利普的意见吧
Do you want me to ask Lip next time we do it?

38
00:01:08,787 --> 00:01:10,354
好了 不好意思 妈妈
Okay, I'm sorry, mom.

39
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:13,372
是利普 他约在公园见面
It's... it's Lip. He wants to meet at the park.

40
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:19,027

What'd you hit?

41
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:21,457
学校的一个女生

46
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:49,434
# 但已不曾再现 #

48
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:56,126
# 何以形容 #
that you speak of?

49
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:58,300
# 你如此肯定的 #
what is this feeling

50

54
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:23,441
# 但已不曾再现 #
but it's not like that anymore

55
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:26,804
# 曾经的落魄 #
what is this downside

56
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:30,478
# 何以形容 #
that you speak of?

57
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:32,428
# 你如此肯定的 #
what is this feeling

58
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:35,993
# 是什么样的感受 #
you're so sure of?

59
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:51,670
你觉得乔治华盛顿和多少仆人发生过性关系
How many slaves you think George Washington had sex with?

60
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,154
卡尔 吃饭 现在
Carl, eat. Now.

61
00:02:53,188 --> 00:02:54,980
比林肯多 比杰斐逊少

62
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:56,799
伊恩 那淤青看起来好多了

63
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,175
- 你又被谁打了 - 没人

64
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,735
是在训练营 训练肉搏战
It's ROTC, practicing hand-to-hand.

65
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,588
水军还用拳头打架吗
Marines still fight with their fists?

66
00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:04,048
特殊情况下 是的

69
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:10,201

Can I use last night's chicken bones to make soup?

70
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:11,929
不是垃圾桶里的就行
As long as they're not in the trash.

71
00:03:11,963 --> 00:03:13,482
利普有凯伦的新消息吗
Lip hear anything new about Karen?

72
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:14,742
还在睡
Still asleep.

73
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,162
凯伦还是利普
Karen or Lip?

74
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,656
俩
Both.

75
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,769
又早起 还吃早餐了 真不错
Up and at 'em, yet again. Impressive.

76
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:22,356
有工作就是这样
Having a job does that to me.

77
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,850
你重新照顾利亚姆可以吗
You good with Liam duty again today?

78
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:25,771
我和利亚姆骨子里就是好兄弟
Me and Liam are deeply bonded bros.

79
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,420
我能和你说几句话吗
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

80
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:31,002
当然 你可以和我一起走吗
Uh, yeah, cool. Can you walk with me?

81
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,730
可以啊

Sure, newsboy. Headline away.

87
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:46,383
好的
Okay.

88
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:48,934
"建立更好的世界"
"Helping the world be a better place."

89
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:50,653
怎么说
Yeah, how's that?

90
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:52,908
我在考虑重回医学院
I'm thinking about going back to medical school.

91
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,495
什么
What?

92
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,280
我已经完成了两年 只剩下一年了
I already finished two years, only have one to go.

93
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:59,471
感觉这对我们都好
I'm just thinking it might be the right thing to do for us.

94
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,000
未来之类的 稳定的工作
Future and all. Stability.

95
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:03,117
医学院不是很难吗 而且很贵
Isn't med school really hard? And expensive?

96
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:04,446
但回报高
Yes, but the payoff's great.

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,470
六位数 我可以贷款
Six figures, and I'll take out loans.

98
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:07,932
如果不行 我就拖欠着
Doesn't work out, I'll just default.

99
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:10,384
"吉米医生" 是吗
"Doctor Jimmy," huh?

100
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,240
是啊 听起来比较蠢
Yeah, spit-balling.

101
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:14,797
好吧 我要去给有需要的人
Okay. Well, I'm off to sell cups

102
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:16,520
卖杯子了
to people that use them.

103
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:17,749
可没有去医学院那么有趣
Not as exciting as medical school,

104
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:21,264
但还是挺好玩的
but exciting nonetheless.

105
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:27,069
嘿
Hey.

106
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:29,160
好了 开始吧
Okay, let's get started.

107
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:30,884
你们知道此行的目的
You all know why you're here.

108
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:33,376
你们在新闻上在推特上脸书上
You've seen his story on the news,

109
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,633
看到了他的故事
on Twitter feeds, on your Facebook walls.

110
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:40,516
他的一生都未曾出柜
His is a tale of a lifetime in the closet,

111
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,215
可他做出了勇敢的决定 接受了他的本性
of a brave midlife embrace of his true nature,

112
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:47,560
在至关重要的公民权利的问题上
and an acknowledgment that he is a lightning rod

113
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:49,514
他成为了避雷针
for a vital civil rights issue.

114
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:51,406
女士们先生们 有请弗兰克盖拉格
Ladies and gentlemen, Frank Gallagher.

115
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,334
弗兰克
Frank?

116
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,150
我们正... 我们正处于我们国家历史中的
We're at a... we are at a crucial time

117
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:07,150
关键时刻
in our nation's history.

118
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:12,577
此时 我们只能把国家往正确的方向推动
Where, as a nation, we'll either pivot toward what's right...

119
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,492
否则... 即被困在这错误的境地
or, um... stay stuck in what's wrong,

120
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:22,387
并且不允许犯错 现在 成为同性恋是一件可怕的事
and make no mistake, right now, it's a horrible time to be gay.

121
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:26,114
而我 就像你们一样 直接地感受到这种可怕
And I, like all of you, have experienced it firsthand.

122
00:05:26,148 --> 00:05:28,879
显然 我引起了一场骚动
Apparently, I've caused a ruckus

123
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:34,870
因为我说同性恋们应该拥有公民权利
because I said that gay folks deserve certain civil rights...

124
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:38,604
拥有那些饲养员不希望给予我的权利
rights that the breeders don't want to bestow upon me.

125
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,675
哈哈哈 给予我们
Ha, ha, ha. Upon we.

126
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,183
那些饲养员 只是想阻止我们发生性关系
Those breeders, all they wanna do is stop us

127
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:47,654
因为他们得不到
from having the sex that they wish they were having.

128
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:52,707
如果...
If... if...

129
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:54,948
如果我们所发生的性关系惹到他们生气了
if the kind of sex we're having is what offends them most,

130
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:56,385
那他们就应该允许我们结婚
they should let us get married,

131
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:57,787
因为结了婚的人都知道
'cause anybody who's been married

132
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:59,556
婚姻是性的下坡
knows that the sex is downhill from there.

133
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:05,057
现在 这么久以来... 谢谢 这么久以来 我们都被误解了
Now, we have long... thank you. We have long been wronged,

134
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,226
现在是时候立法
and it's time for legislation

135
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,528
允许我们的私处为挑逗我们的人
that allows our private parts to be aroused

136
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:13,397
而雄起
by the people God intended to arouse them.

137
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:16,800
并且...
And...

138
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:21,404
并且是时候让它们在婚姻的束缚下雄起
and it's time for that arousal to happen within marriage!

139
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,975
请拿出你们男人的钱包
So get out your wallets, or your... your man purses,

140
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,008
来捐款吧
or whatever, and give now,

141
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:31,811
因为我不想再在早上雄起
'cause I hope never to be up again this early,

142
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:35,513
却没有你们在身旁
unless it's rolling over with a couple of you in bed.

143
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:42,154
谢谢 我爱你们
Thank you. I love you.

144
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:46,894
我勒个去 你真厉害 你是怎么变这么厉害的
Shit, you're good! How did you get so good?

145
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:48,662
我这一辈子 都在努力地说服人们
My whole life, I've been trying to convince people

146
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:50,063
去做他们不想做的事
to do what they really don't want to do.

147
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:52,699
那封... 大方的先生
The... the envelope, kind sir?

148
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:54,067
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

149
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:57,002
现在我们来谈一下为我的房间升级
Now, we gotta talk about upgrading my room.

150
00:06:57,037 --> 00:06:58,738
你可以用我最近努力赚回来的钱
Uh, you can tip the front desk

151
00:06:58,772 --> 00:07:01,939
给前台一些小费
with some of my recently departed hard-earned cash.

152
00:07:01,974 --> 00:07:04,841
便捷商务旅馆的前台
The front desk at the Merchant Motor Inn

153
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:06,776
在防子弹的玻璃后面
is behind bulletproof glass.

154
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,510
那是树脂玻璃
It's plexiglass.

155
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:10,278
你有一张大床和许多付费频道
You have a queen bed and premium channels.

156
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:13,048
你刚见证了我的能力 我是你新的游说者了
You saw what I did here. I'm your new rainmaker.

157
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:18,286
我能让这些用屁股交易的人每天每夜都给你递现金
I can get these rump-swappers to cough up cash night and day.

158
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,455
"用屁股交易的人"
"Rump-swappers"?

159
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,123
这诋毁我还从来没听过
There's a slur I've never heard before.

160
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,793
好吧 先看看高中的演讲怎么样
Okay, we'll see how the high school speech goes,

161
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:26,294
在那儿之前 你还需要工作
but until then, you're still on the clock,

162
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:29,596
现在去和大家握手 你这个用屁股交易的小伙
so go shake some hands, ya little rump-swapper.

163
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:33,599
你这个小调皮
You saucy tart, you.

164
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,266
不好意思
Sorry about that.

165
00:07:58,301 --> 00:08:00,634
很正常
It happens.

166
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,371
如果不是你 我可以...
Look, it's not you. I just, I...

167
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:08,374
我没办法不去想凯伦撞车
I can't get Karen getting hit by that car out of my mind.

168
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:13,414
嘿
Hey.

169
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,417
等等 我可以专心的
Hey, wait a minute. I can focus.

170
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:18,622
我上学要迟到了 午饭时间我们可以到
I'm late for school. We can give each other head

171
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:20,758
足球场的罩棚下再来一次
in the shed behind the football field at lunch.

172
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,294
罩棚那儿连低头都很难
It is hard to turn down head in the shed,

173
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:25,661
但我午饭的时候可能去不了
but I might not make it there by lunch.

174
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:29,598
要去一下医院 看看凯伦怎么样
Gotta stop by the hospital, see if Karen's okay.

175
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:31,333
她还没醒
She's in a coma.

176
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:35,670
我知道 我只是... 去给点支持
No, I know, I just... wanna show some support.

177
00:08:35,704 --> 00:08:39,174
她都不知道你去了
She won't even know that you're there.

178
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,913
但还是去一下吧
Still, it's the right thing to do.

179
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:43,324
你想我和你一起去吗
Well, you want me to come with?

180
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:45,468
不用
No, I'm cool.

181
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,691
怎么了
What's wrong?

182
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:55,957
没什么
Nothing.

183
00:08:55,991 --> 00:08:57,287
你的额头起皱纹了
Your brow is furrowed.

184
00:08:57,322 --> 00:08:58,812
哦 正常的时候就这样
Oh, that's its natural state.

185
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:00,841
其实是我男朋友
Actually, my boyfriend

186
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:03,007
在我走之前给我闹点事
just kinda sprung some news on me as I was leaving.

187
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,839
他想做什么 和朋友晚上出去玩
What's your guy want, a night out with the boys?

188
00:09:04,874 --> 00:09:06,703
买新的卡车
New pickup truck?

189
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:11,101
其实他是想重新回到医学院
Actually, he's thinking about going back to medical school.

190
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,638
哇 你在和医生约会
Wow, you're dating a doctor.

191
00:09:12,672 --> 00:09:14,675
下午茶来啦
New K-cups came in!

192
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:18,212
我要最好的法式香草
I need me my French vanilla supreme!

193
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:21,642
太棒了 拿一杯黑虎给我这个女人
Hells, yeah! And a black tiger for the con-woman!

194
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:23,041
我们要庆祝
We got to celebrate.

195
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:25,039
菲奥娜的未婚夫要成为医生了
Fiona's fiance is gonna be a doctor.

196
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:26,804
他不是我的未婚夫
He's not my fiance.

197
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,469
- 现在还不是 - 套牢他 姑娘
- Yet. - Put your hooks in him, girl.

198
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:29,868
医生都有钱得很
Doctors are rich.

199
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,663
太好啦 K杯[重用过滤器]到啦
All right, K-cups are in. Fantastic.

200
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,826
我们在庆祝菲奥娜未来的医生丈夫
We're celebrating Fiona's impending marriage to a doctor.

201
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:37,590
哦 哇 真的吗
Oh, wow. Really?

202
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:40,122
我 不 不一定
I-- no, not really.

203
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:43,450
你的K杯喜欢用哪种
Well, what flavor's your "K" cup poison?

204
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:46,449
- 我没用过 什么
- Never had one. - What?

205
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:48,982
来让我们带你参观公司的咖啡界
Well, let us usher you across the workplace coffee frontier.

206
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:50,612
她以后可不用这里了
She ain't gonna need a workplace much longer.

207
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:52,012
很快 她就会有仆人从银杯
Yeah, soon, she'll have her servants

208
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:53,676
里倒咖啡出来了
bringing her coffee out of a silver chalice.

209
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,406
好了 好了 别说啦
Okay, come on now, stop.

210
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:56,739
- 哦 - 不 我其实是说 继续吧
- Oh. - No, seriously, keep going.

211
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:06,397
早上好 曼迪
Morning, Mandy.

212
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:08,629
利普为什么这么在意那个贱人
Why does Lip give a fuck whether that bitch Karen

213
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:09,895
凯伦的死活
is alive or dead?

214
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:13,490
这是个迷
It's a mystery.

215
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:18,785
她又怎么了
What was all that about?

216
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,548
你 凯伦 莫测的男人心理
You, Karen, the unfathomable male soul.

217
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,413
你怎么没去学校
Why aren't you in school?

218
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:24,979
翘了
Skipping.

219
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:27,611
小黛比 我们家起码得有一个人不那么愤世嫉俗
Debs, we need at least one person in this family

220
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:30,044
我就指望你了
to not turn cynical, and my money's been on you.

221
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:32,208
我给希莉娅做了点汤
I made soup for Sheila.

222
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:34,207
很好 我会带去医院的
That's nice. I'm gonna drop by the hospital.

223
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:35,638
帮你送过去
I'll take it for you.

224
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:37,568
然后不劳而获地
And take the credit for doing something nice

225
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:39,699
得到赞扬
when you actually did nothing?

226
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:41,296
嘿 公平地说
Well, to be fair, at that point,

227
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:43,792
我得一路拿过去
I will have carried it all the way over there, so--

228
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:47,841
你觉得曼迪这样对你是理所当然
You're taking Mandy for granted.

229
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:49,172
为什么 她和你说什么了
Why? What'd she tell you?

230
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:51,261
她人好 为你付出了很多
She's kind, she's devoted,

231
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:53,590
你不能不在乎她的感受
she's not someone whose feelings you can ignore,

232
00:10:53,624 --> 00:10:55,189
别当笨蛋了
so stop being a dope,

233
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:58,680
偶尔也替她想想吧
and put her feelings first every once in a while.

234
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:02,543
学校是个认识你的思维和
School is a time to experiment with your minds

235
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,975
生殖器的地方
and with your genitalia.

236
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:09,570
对我而言 人类的生殖器 是指引人类的
Now, the human genitalia, to me, is like a homing device--

237
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:12,366
指南针
God's compass. Huh?

238
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:15,030
我们每个人都有
And each of us has it,

239
00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:18,785
它将我们引向命定的归宿
and it guides us to our destined homes.

240
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:22,715
如果我们强迫它指向一个它不想去的方向
Now, our devices don't work if we try to point 'em

241
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,613
它就会失灵
in a direction that they don't want to go in.

242
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:26,510
天哪 他得稍微收敛一点
He needs to tone it down, please.

243
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:27,776
就让人们自己做决定吧
But, you know, I laugh for a point,

244
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:29,943
听从他们
because let people chow down

245
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:32,340
自己的心
on the nether region of their choice--

246
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:36,369
男性 女性 动物
male, female, consenting animal.

247
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,668
停下
Stop-- uh...

248
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,800
梅森预科学院 谢谢你们

Thank you. You're terrific.

251
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:45,796
真的很棒
You guys are terrific.

252
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,793
- 抱歉 我 - 怎么回事
- I-- I'm sorry. It's-- I can't-- - What the hell was that?

253
00:11:47,828 --> 00:11:50,521
是酒店的房间设施 我需要个迷你冰箱
It's the hotel. I need a mini-fridge.

254
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:52,121
至少给我个电炉
I need a hot plate at the very least.

255
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:53,352
- 我试着睡个午觉 - 打扰一下
- I tried to take a nap... - Excuse me?

256
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:54,851
- 但是我 - 打扰一下
- And I can't-- - Excuse me,

257
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:57,748
这是我听过的最真心的演讲
that was the most honest speech I've ever heard.

258
00:11:57,782 --> 00:11:59,081
我刚刚给我爸发了短信 他同意我
I just texted my dad, and he told me

259
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,078
给你们捐款一千美元
I could donate $1,000 to the cause.

260
00:12:01,113 --> 00:12:03,742
支票的收款人是
Um, who do I make the check out to?

261
00:12:03,776 --> 00:12:05,340
"确信委员会"
"The Certitude Commission."

262
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:07,538
好的 好了
Okay. "Cert"-- okay.

263
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:22,090
停用镇静安眠剂和瘫痪药
Kill the phenobarbital and paralytics.

264
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:26,154
请问
Excuse me.

265
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:29,183
请问一下 嗨 抱歉 早上好
Excuse me, hi. I'm sorry. I know-- good morning.

266
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:30,781
我知道你很忙
I know you're really busy,

267
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:32,779
但是 你要"停用"什么
but what-- what are you "killing"?

268
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:34,978
她的脑部有涨水的现象
The swelling appears to have gone down in her brain,

269
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:36,976
所以我在停导致她昏迷的药物
so I'm killing the meds that induce the coma.

270
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,506
哦 是吗 请问
Oh, okay. Excuse me.

271
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,437
抱歉 那是什么意思
I'm sorry. What does that mean?

272
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:41,836
我要帮她停些药
I'm removing some of her meds.

273
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,397
- 是吗 抱歉 - 嘿
- Okay. N-- I'm sorry-- - Hey!

274
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,328
- 什么事 - 我是个好人
- Yes? - I'm a nice guy.

275
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:49,493
有耐心 一般情况下不喜欢使用暴力
Patient, not usually a violent dude,

276
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:52,057
但是你要是不用我们能懂得语言
but if you try to leave here one more time

277
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:53,289
解释清楚
without telling us what's going on

278
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:54,724
并试图离开的话
in words we can understand,

279
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,730
我会把你那小身躯举过头顶
I will your lift your tiny body over my head

280
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:59,972
从窗口扔下去
and throw you out the window.

281
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:03,343
她的脑部受到了重创
Your wife has sustained serious trauma to her brain.

282
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:06,612
所以你说你要撤掉
So you said that you're removing

283
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:08,781
那些让她昏迷的药
the meds that induce the coma.

284
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:10,783
她要醒了吗
Does that mean she's gonna wake up soon?

285
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:12,018
这是一种可能性
That is one possibility.

286
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:13,286
还有什么可能
What are the other possibilities?

287
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:14,786
她不会很快醒来
That she won't wake up soon,

288
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:16,354
或者永远醒不来
or that she won't wake up ever.

289
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:18,423
她要是醒过来 会好好的吗
But if she does wake up, will she be okay?

290
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:22,460
她醒过来之前我们也不知道
We won't know how much damage there is until she wakes.

291
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:24,595
我们能帮她清醒吗
Well, can we help her wake up?

292
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,997
她 她能听见我们的声音吗
Is she-- can she hear us in there?

293
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:29,099
没有人知道
Nobody knows,

294
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:31,101
我也不想被扔出窗外
and I don't want to get myself thrown out the window.

295
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:34,871
宝贝
Sweetie?

296
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:37,406
该醒醒了
Time to wake up.

297
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,678
培根 芹菜 西红柿夹在白面包里
Bacon, lettuce, and tomato on white,

298
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:44,481
就像你喜欢的那样
just like your other favorite meat.

299
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,619
没反应 我努力了很久耶
Really, nothing? I've been brewing that line for weeks.

300
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,554
我妈的生理期是明天
Mom's period day is tomorrow.

301
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:52,322
- 哦 - 你不知道吗
- Oh. - You didn't know that?

302
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:54,558
啊 拜托 V 我的脑容量就这么大
Ah, come on, V, I only got so much in the hard drive.

303
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:56,327
记住你妈的月经周期
Remembering your mom's menstrual cycle

304
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:57,861
可不是头号要紧的
is not a top priority.

305
00:13:57,896 --> 00:13:59,664
要不我去超市买根验孕棒
Want me to go to Walgreen's, get a pee stick?

306
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:01,400
- 真的吗 - 难道我还能是开玩笑
- Honestly? - No, no, lie to me.

307
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:03,702
我听说那能加深夫妇感情
I hear it makes marriages thrive.

308
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:05,838
快吃
Eat.

309
00:14:05,873 --> 00:14:08,742
我去买根验孕棒 然后打给你妈
I'll get a pee stick, we'll call your mom,

310
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:13,315
然后我们看着她用 会很好玩的
and we'll watch her take a piss. It'll be fun.

311
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:17,720
米奇居然要结婚了 你能相信吗
Mickey getting married, does that make sense to you?

312
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,356
为什么不
What sense needs to be made?

313
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,759
某人怀孕了 某人让她怀孕了
Someone's pregnant, someone got them pregnant,

314
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:24,796
这就是为什么会有婚姻在了
and that's... why marriage was invented.

315
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,533
他们约会很久了吗
They been going out long?

316
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:32,269
谁知道呢 他们搞的时候我又不在场
Who knows, I wasn't in on the courting, or the fucking.

317
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,804
他们在哪里见面呢
So where did they meet?

318
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,074
她在公园喷泉水疗馆工作
She works at Garden Springs Spa,

319
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,779
如果帮陌生人打飞机也算工作的话
if you call jerking off random dudes working.

320
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:40,280
她漂亮吗
She pretty?

321
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,752
用瞎眼的俄罗斯手妓标准来看
On the dead-eyed Russian hand-whore scale?

322
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:46,265
差不多七分吧
I'd say she'd rate about a seven.

323
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:55,426
- 你有低脂糖吗 - 没有
- You have sweet and low? - I do not.

324
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,467
没关系 我随身带着
It's okay. I always keep some in my wallet.

325
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:00,937
加进去就好
Just have to replace this one.

326

不请我进去坐坐吗
When will you invite me inside for scones?

328
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,268
不可能 听着
No time soon. Listen,

329
00:15:09,303 --> 00:15:11,170
我在考虑去密歇根做个短期旅行
I'm thinking about taking a little vacation to Michigan.

330
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:13,541
不会又是要去偷车吧
I hope it's not to commandeer a shipment of cars.

331
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:16,316
我打算回去读医学院
I'm thinking of going back to medical school.

332
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,856
密歇根
In Michigan?

333
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,125
我没读完就走了 现在只剩下
I quit before I could finish, and I only have

334
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,694
几个学期就能拿到学位了
a couple of semesters left to get my degree,

335
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:23,729
- 所以 - 所以不是去度假
- so-- - So not a vacation?

336
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:26,199
不算是
Not exactly, no.

337
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,901
何必拐角抹弯 直说
So why the step-stutter? Why not tell me that

338
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:29,736
- 不就好了 - 是"拐弯抹角"
- from the beginning? - It's "stutter-step," okay?

339
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,371
我只是先试试水
I was testing the waters first.

340
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:33,072
对你我都有好处
It's good for me, and for you.

341
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:35,842
我会老老实实地 不惹麻烦
I'll be keeping out of trouble, keeping my nose clean.

342

对
Yes.

344
00:15:38,612 --> 00:15:41,013
我们可以去转转
I mean, we can go up there, drive around.

345
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:43,683
那里美食很多
I mean, great food. Excellent cheese. Truth.

346

先说服她搬家吧

349
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:52,194
我的小宝贝

350
00:15:52,229 --> 00:15:53,730
我的小宝贝
(Portuguese) Where is my little boy?

351
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:55,865
等下 要是我能说服 你去吧
Wait, is it-- but if I do, you're onboard?

352
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,867
你为什么认为我管事呢
Why is it you think I am in charge, huh?

353
00:15:57,902 --> 00:15:59,369
- 管事 - 我不是管事的人
- Charge! - I'm not the one

354
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:00,904
谁才是呢 你是吗
who's in charge. Are you in charge?

355
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,873
你管事
You're in charge.

356
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,509
- 管事 - 我只会去我应该去的地方
- Charge. - I go where I'm supposed to go

357
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:07,244
做我应该做的事
and I do what I'm supposed to do, okay?

358
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,415
这样我才不会惹麻烦
If I do those things, I stay out of trouble.

359
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:16,154
建议你也这么做
I suggest you do the same.

360
00:16:43,923 --> 00:16:47,286

嘿 勤劳的小蜜蜂

只是想把这些弄完
Just trying to get through this stack.

365
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:19,944
弄完这堆又会有一堆
Another stack just replaces this stack.

366
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:21,246
新的一堆在哪里呢
Where's the next stack?

367
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,579
学学慢的科学吧
Embrace the science of slow.

368
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:24,914
你在把K杯的活儿交给我之前
You shoulda thought about that before you made me

369
00:17:24,948 --> 00:17:26,515
应该想到的
mainline K-cups.

370
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,685
我喝了一杯航空汽油 两罐黑虎

我感觉精力充沛
I feel like I just did an eight ball.

373
00:17:31,556 --> 00:17:33,693
你可不想干的太出色
You don't wanna raise the level of expectation

374
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:35,529
不然玛利亚病好回来可怎么办

You'll pay me back in spades

379
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:44,271
你也能请回我

380
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:47,141
- 来吧 来吧 - 好吧

能欣赏得了我的才华
willing to reward me for my talents.

385

盗窃和呕吐的才华
Larceny and vomiting?

386

Haven't seen you this cleaned up in ages, Frank.

394
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,536

00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:37,920
我可以请你喝一杯吗
Can I buy you a drink?

404
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:39,455
两杯吧
Make it two.

405
00:18:55,974 --> 00:18:57,408
敬男人
To men.

406
00:18:57,442 --> 00:18:59,673
我为"重返乐园工程"工作
I work for "Return To Paradise Project."

407
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,273
我们是转型的政府部门
We're a transformational ministry

408
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,407
专攻性倾向转换疗法
specializing in conversion therapy.

409
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,783
我们让同性恋者重回健康的异性恋生活方式
We return homosexuals to healthy heterosexual lifestyles.

410
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:08,221
你为什么做这个
Why would you go do that?

411
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:10,758
我们相信同性恋是可以治愈的
We believe that homosexuality is curable.

412
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:14,461
虽然有些人乐在其中 但同性恋是一种毒瘾
Though some find pleasure in it, homosexuality is an addiction,

413
00:19:14,496 --> 00:19:16,530
一种让家庭痛苦分离的毒瘾
an addiction that tears families apart.

414
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:18,932
我有个同性恋儿子 从来不用担心
I have a gay son. Never have to worry

415
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:21,702
他会搞大邻居烦人的荡妇的肚子
about him impregnating some skanky neighborhood slut

416
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:24,371
然后把她的小杂种带回家
and bringing home her unplanned-for half-breed.

417
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:26,973
我真希望当时就发现自己是同志
I wish I'd known I was gay back then.

418
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:28,942
我就可能在很多被同志一统江山的领域
I could've risen high in any one of the many fields

419
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:32,579
出人头地了 娱乐 政治
dominated by gays. Entertainment, politics,

420
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,114
广播
broadcasting.

421
00:19:34,148 --> 00:19:35,715
网球
Tennis.

422
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,784
你现在为阿布汉姆 佩吉工作吗
You're working for Abraham Paige's agenda?

423
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:40,654
我是在扫除不平 在帮助被压迫的人
I'm cleaning up. Helping the oppressed.

424
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:42,422
他们是上了瘾 不是被压迫
They're addicted, not oppressed,

425
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:45,426
而且我们可以付你更多钱
and we can pay you more.

426
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,061
多多少
How much more?

427
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:48,829
固定薪水 住处 膳食
Stipend, room, board,

428
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,833
和可观的实现治疗的演讲费
and substantial speaking fees upon completion of therapy.

429
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:54,102
我拒绝治疗
I draw the line at therapy.

430
00:19:54,136 --> 00:19:56,738
但弗兰克 没有治疗 就不能治愈
But Frank, see, without the therapy, there's no cure.

431
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:59,808
我们希望可以说治愈了你
I want to be able to say we cured you.

432
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:03,645
我现在是同志 我现在需要当同志
Gay is who I am now. Gay is who I shall be.

433
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,680
弗兰克 你曾经走过正确的道路
Frank, you once walked the true path

434
00:20:05,715 --> 00:20:07,249
异性恋的道路
of heterosexual love.

435
00:20:07,283 --> 00:20:09,851
如果我能让你回归正途
If I were to redirect you back onto that path,

436
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:11,786
你就会成为我们项目更有说服力的演讲者
you'll be a much more compelling speaker for our cause,

437
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,856
因为你就成了那个经历了炼狱之火后
because you'll have been singed by the fires of hell,

438
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,124
活着回来讲述的人了
but lived to tell.

439
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:18,526
我们的治疗有效
Our therapy works.

440
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,194
从厌恶疗法开始
It starts with aversion techniques,

441
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:22,664
控制你遏制进行同性性行为的苗头
conditioning you to avoid certain gay-sex triggers.

442
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,333
一旦你练习过这些治疗项目
Clinical fornication would start

443
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:27,102
我们就开始治疗性性行为了
once you've practiced some of those techniques.

444
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:29,772
抱歉 治疗性性行为 
Sorry, clinical fornication?

445
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:32,007
我们会德拉克罗瓦酒店给你订房
We house you in the Delacroix Hotel,

446
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,642
然后送女人过去跟你滚床单
and deliver women to you to have sex with

447
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:36,778
直到你被治好
until you're cured.

448
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:40,015
抱 抱歉 打断一下 什么
I-I-I'm sorry, I interrupted you. What--?

449
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,351
我们觉得这样比鸡奸罪过轻点
We feel this is a lesser sin than sodomy.

450
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:46,394
我承认这不符合传统
I grant that this seems unconventional,

451
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:49,306
但为了阻止瘟疫蔓延就必须有新点子
but new ideas are necessary to counter unwavering plagues.

452
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,677
我们是在铺砌重归上帝的道路
We're paving a road back to God,

453
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:53,810
但魔鬼在路上竖起障碍
and the devil has erected obstacles

454
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:57,779
为了取得更好的效果 就需要打破常规
that call for rule-bending in service of a greater good.

455
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:01,183
给我点流动经费 
Throw in some walking around money,

456
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:04,348
我可以试试
and I'll give it a shot.

457
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,213
要和米奇结婚的那个婊子
That whore that Mickey's marrying

458
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:36,981
是在春天花园水疗馆工作的真婊子
is an actual whore that works at Garden Springs Spa.

459
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:39,249
朋友和家人去打手枪打折吗
Friends and family discounts on handy-Js.

460
00:21:39,283 --> 00:21:42,984
特里逼他搞她 好让他不要当同志
Terry made Mickey fuck her to fuck the gay out of him.

461
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:44,252
什么时候
When?

462
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:46,019
他抓到我们在一起之后
After he caught us together.

463
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:48,418
兄弟 我怎么不知道这事
Dude, how did I not know this shit?

464
00:21:48,452 --> 00:21:50,049
我没告诉你
I didn't tell you.

465
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,683
有用吗
Well, did it work?

466
00:21:56,118 --> 00:22:00,085
他假装过一两次
I mean, he might've faked it once or twice,

467
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,686
但是他想和我在一起
but he wants to be with me.

468
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:12,021
我知道他对我的感觉 是装不出来的
I know what he felt with me. You can't fake that.

469
00:22:12,056 --> 00:22:15,693
但现在 这妞怀孕了
And now, this chick is pregnant.

470
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:30,001
伊恩 老弟 你应该放下了
Ian, my brother, you need to get out there

471
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:33,670
去找个新的来搞 好吗
and fuck someone new, okay?

472
00:22:33,704 --> 00:22:36,538
找个二十来岁的
And someone in his early 20s,

473
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:38,738
不要像卡什或是奈德那样的老家伙
not some old dude like Kash or Ned.

474
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:40,506
操你妈
Fuck you.

475
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,570
好吧 真的 去同志酒吧
All right, seriously, go into a gay bar,

476
00:22:43,604 --> 00:22:47,767
表明你的需要 然后满足需要
make your need known, and have at it.

477
00:22:53,637 --> 00:22:56,904
曼迪因为你为了凯伦难过而难过
Mandy's upset you're upset about Karen.

478
00:22:56,938 --> 00:22:58,842
天呐 曼迪跟多少人说了
Jesus. How many people is Mandy talking to?

479
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,181
她在乎你
She cares about you.

480
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:05,180
为什么 我不知道 你真是个白痴
Why... I don't know. You can be a real shithead.

481
00:23:10,193 --> 00:23:12,656
为什么我们俩
How did we get this mixed up

482
00:23:12,688 --> 00:23:16,084
都和米科维奇家的人纠缠不清呢
with two people from the Milkovich family?

483
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:21,411
- 家教不好 - 对
- Bad parenting. - Yeah.

484
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,608
两人份的牛排
Prime rib for two?

485
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,702
放那儿吧 对
Right there. Yeah. Oh.

486
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:49,962
这是你的
And here you go,

487
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:53,656
再一盘
and here you go.

488
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:57,019
盖拉格先生 请原谅我的唐突
Mr. Gallagher? Please excuse my informality,

489
00:23:57,054 --> 00:23:59,649
但我看到你上了电视
but I saw you on TV, and just,

490
00:23:59,683 --> 00:24:01,448
我代表整个同性恋团体
on behalf of the entire gay community,

491
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,844
感谢你勇于站在
I want to thank you for putting yourself

492
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:04,343
这政治问题的风口浪尖上
in the crosshairs of this political issue.

493
00:24:04,378 --> 00:24:06,773
你的行为很勇敢也很鼓舞人心
I mean, it's courageous and inspiring.

494
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:08,670
您住在这时不管需要什么
Whatever you need while you are here...

495
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,469

498
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:17,058

Oh! Absolutely, yes.

499
00:24:17,092 --> 00:24:19,654
我叫耶瑟斯
Um, my name is Jesus.

500
00:24:19,688 --> 00:24:22,716
你需要我帮你定水疗服务吗 还是
Do you need me to sign you up for any spa treatments, or...

501
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:24,647
我明天很闲
Well, I'm wide-open tomorrow,

502
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:28,145
给我安排从早到晚的按摩

00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,739
好的 我会的
Okay-- will do.

505
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:34,138
番茄酱
Ketchup.

506
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,470
对
Oh, right!

507
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:37,599
我的牙齿可能
Is it possible that my teeth

508
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:39,365
自己长直吗
will spontaneously straighten out on their own?

509
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,527
吉米要回去读医学院了
Uh, Jimmy's going back to medical school.

510
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:43,427
我们可以请他帮忙
We can ask him to help.

511
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:44,724
我要酒
I need alcohol.

512
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:46,356
你妈还是没怀孕吗
Is your mom not pregnant again?

513
00:24:46,391 --> 00:24:48,354
找不到她 去了她家 她工作的地方
Can't find her. Went to her house, her work.

514
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:51,017
她在躲我 肯定是坏消息
She's avoiding me. Must be bad news.

515
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:52,583
- 往好处想 - 之前两个月
- Think positive. - I've done that

516
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:53,916
一直往好处想的
for the past two months,

517
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,547
但她每次做尿检
and every time she pees on the stick,

518
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,380
都是坏消息 而且我一想到
it's bad news, and then I get depressed

519
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,776
我的老公搞了我的妈妈就很郁闷
thinking about my husband banging my mom,

520
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,179
因为我自私地希望宝宝有我们的基因
'cause we selfishly want to have a baby with some of our DNA--

521
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:05,085
而我妈可能再也怀不上了
and maybe my mom can't get pregnant anymore,

522
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,520
我们白白做了这么荒唐的事 
and we've crossed this line for no reason,

523
00:25:07,555 --> 00:25:10,221
而且我每次都会想起跟我老公滚床单的不是我
and every time I'm reminded it's not me banging my husband,

524
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:11,719
用验孕棒的不是我
and it's not me peeing on the stick,

525
00:25:11,753 --> 00:25:13,617
生宝宝的也不是我
and it's not me that gets to have the baby!

526
00:25:13,952 --> 00:25:16,815
V 如果不是为了你 你妈也不会这么做
V, your mom wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't for you.

527
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,983
阿凯会这么做也只是因为爱你
Kev's only doing this because he loves you.

528
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,315
如果不是你就不会有宝宝
There'd be no baby without you.

529
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:23,981
他们都那么爱你 一切都是为了你
They all love you so much. This is all about you.

530
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:28,211
所以你就喝喝酒 拿验孕棒
So you're gonna get some wine, get the stick,

531
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:31,176
带你妈去厕所 如果是坏消息
get your mom in the bathroom, and if you get bad news,

532
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,308
就醉一场
get drunk,

533
00:25:33,342 --> 00:25:35,574
我们再去想接下来怎么办
and we'll figure out what comes next.

534
00:25:35,608 --> 00:25:37,706
谁要沙士冰淇淋咖啡啊
Who needs root beer float coffee?

535
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:40,203
都要
All of us.

536
00:25:42,736 --> 00:25:43,968
我爱你
I love you.

537
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,867
- 有消息了就打电话给我 - 谢谢 
- Call me with the news. - Thank you.

538
00:25:45,902 --> 00:25:48,869
黛比 卡尔 睡觉咯
Debs, Carl, bedtime!

539
00:25:48,903 --> 00:25:50,536
看我的牙齿
See these?

540
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:53,335
你能给我买牙箍吗 就像给卡尔买的那个
Can you buy me braces like you paid for Carl's?

541
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:54,568
黛比 你的牙看起来还好啊
Aw, Debbie, they don't look so bad.

542
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:56,301
闭嘴
Shut up!

543
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:58,300
如果你的"还好"是一颗往这边
Yeah, if "not that bad" means one going this way

544
00:25:58,334 --> 00:25:59,633
一颗往那边的话 那还好
and one going that way. Then yeah.

545
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,165
这样显得有个性
Well, they add character.

546
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,030
我长着红头发 满脸雀斑 和歪牙齿
I have red hair, freckles, and crooked teeth.

547
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:04,697
不需要再有个性了
Don't need any more character.

548
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,295
好吧 听着 我现在手头有点紧
Okay, listen, things are a little tight right now,

549
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,662
但是我会想办法 很快 我保证 好吗
but I'll make it happen, soon. I promise, okay?

550
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:14,828
所以
So...

551
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:18,126
医学院对吧
medical school, huh?

552
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,558
我 我是说 尝试了很多工作
I... I mean, I put in a ton of work,

553
00:26:22,593 --> 00:26:24,856
然后觉得我可能应该回去
and I just got thinking that maybe I should go back

554
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,554
完成没做完的 我
and finish what I started. I--

555
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,818
- 我觉得很好 - 真的吗
- I think it's great. - Really?

556
00:26:30,853 --> 00:26:32,218
嗯
Yeah.

557
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:36,516
你很聪明 你关心他人
You're smart, you care about people,

558
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:38,482
你是个好人 
you're a good person.

559
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:40,876
给卡尔买牙箍 给黛比买牙箍 
Getting Carl braces, Debbie braces,

560
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,705
照顾利亚姆
taking care of Liam.

561
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,364
看看你有多关心我们
Look how much you cared for all of us,

562
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:48,823
又没有什么回报
without getting much in return.

563
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,148
嘿 我收到了很多回报
Hey, I get plenty in return.

564
00:26:52,182 --> 00:26:53,412
我会一直支持你
I'm behind you all the way. Mwa!

565
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:54,639
真的吗 
Really?

566
00:26:54,673 --> 00:26:55,903
因为我很需要
'Cause I'm gonna need it.

567
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:57,301
很多的工作 很多时间
Plenty of work. Plenty of hours.

568
00:26:57,336 --> 00:26:59,399
你会去哪所学校
So where would you go?

569
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:02,964
芝加哥大学 西北大学
University of Chicago? Northwestern?

570
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:05,102
西北大学估计不错
Northwestern could work.

571
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:07,781
对 就登记入学 但是
Yeah, just gotta check into it, but...

572
00:27:07,816 --> 00:27:09,084
有很多选择
plenty of options.

573
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,654
"吉米医生"
"Dr. Jimmy."

574
00:27:10,688 --> 00:27:13,356
听起来很高端啊
That'd be something, huh?

575
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,925
医生
Doctor!

576
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:29,972
嘿
Hey.

577
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:32,875
- 你的房间怎么样 弗兰克 - 设备要修了
- How's your room, Frank? - Amenities need to be amended.

578
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,377
这些迷你瓶太小了
These mini-bottles are a little too mini.

579
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:35,848
我要换点大瓶子的
I need to get some of the big boys up here.

580
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:37,285
我会的
Will do.

581
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,692
我带了些录影 开始转换治疗前
I brought you some media that needs to be viewed

582
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:41,461
你要先看看
before we can begin the conversion process.

583
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:46,200
没问题 我就从这张片看起 
Okey-dokey. I'll get started on this one pronto.

584
00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:48,136
你结过婚吗
You have been married before?

585
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,572
没离过呢 但她从来没真的让我开心
Still am, but she never really floated my boat.

586
00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:54,809
我尽了丈夫的责任让她幸福
I did my husbandly duty to keep her happy,

587
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:56,578
但从来没有快乐
but it was always without pleasure

588
00:27:56,612 --> 00:27:57,846
或乐趣
or joy.

589
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,481
- 有孩子吗 - 有几个
- Kids? - A few.

590
00:27:59,515 --> 00:28:01,417
也就是说你已经
So you have committed the loving act

591
00:28:01,451 --> 00:28:03,152
跟异性做过爱了
of heterosexual copulation?

592
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:06,155
坦白说 那也是因为醉酒的缘故
It was always under the influence, frankly.

593
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,857
小弟弟总要做点事的
Had to get the plumbing to work.

594
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:09,325
不 我们认为你只是脱轨了
No, we think you just got sidetracked.

595
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,562
根据你之前与女性交往的经历
With your history of female contact,

596
00:28:11,596 --> 00:28:14,766
我们可以立即着手治疗你的淫乱病症
we can begin the clinical fornication stage immediately.

597
00:28:14,801 --> 00:28:17,569
我很怀疑它的有效性 不过如果你认为它可能有用的话
I doubt it'll work, but I'll give it my best efforts

598
00:28:17,604 --> 00:28:19,100
我会尽力配合
if you think it might help.

599
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:25,200
员工们 你们好啊
Hello, cuppers!

600
00:28:27,903 --> 00:28:29,604
我的高曾祖父
My great-great-grandfather

601
00:28:29,638 --> 00:28:31,771
曾经在内战中打过仗
fought in the war between the states.

602
00:28:31,806 --> 00:28:34,875
他从那次战争中回来的时候心中有了一个目标
He came back from that war with one goal in mind.

603
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:38,611
那就是发明一种一次性的杯子 这样就不用
To invent a disposable cup so he wouldn't have to wash...

604
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:42,916
洗"这该死的杯子了"
"The same stupid cup every doggone time!"

605
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,884
好消息 我们已经获得批准
Good news! We have received approval...

606
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:46,452
嘿 菲奥娜 你玩垒球的吗
Hey, Fiona, you play softball?

607
00:28:46,487 --> 00:28:48,888
- 呃 不玩 - 从来不玩吗
- Uh, no. - Never?

608
00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:50,557
- 嘘 马特叔叔正在讲话 - 嗯
- Shh! Uncle Matt's talking. - Mm.

609
00:28:50,591 --> 00:28:52,025
干得好维尼 皮塔罗
Nice job, Vinny Pitaro!

610
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:53,393
- 维尼 维尼 - 嘿, 维尼
- Vinny! Vinny! - Hey, Vinny!

611
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:56,062
他在那
There he is!

612
00:28:56,097 --> 00:28:57,764
我们有个名为"纸杯人"的球队
So we have a team called "The Cuppers,"

613
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:00,066
今晚的比赛我希望你能去给我当拉拉队
and I need you on the squad for tonight's game.

614
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,566
说实话 我很菜的
Really, I'm-I'm-I'm terrible.

615
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,861
噢 " 自从我上一次穿上防滑鞋以来
Oh, " it was back before the millennium

616
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:05,428
已经有好几百年了 "
when I last donned me cleats. "

617
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:07,563
- 这是什么调调 - 呃 我想可能是坏坏的英国腔吧
- What accent is that? - Uh, bad British I think.

618
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:08,898
- 嗯哼 - 是的
- Uh-huh. - Yeah.

619
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:10,200
在许多卡车的后挡板上
...thousands of cups

620
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:11,736
都有杯子
at many a tailgate!

621
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,537
去拿吧 伙计们
Go get 'em, cuppers!

622
00:29:13,572 --> 00:29:15,139
去吧 这个联盟有男也有女的
So come on, the league's coed,

623
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:17,575
你知道的 我们需要多一点女士 不然可要输的
so, you know, we need more ladies or we gotta forfeit.

624
00:29:17,609 --> 00:29:20,408
好吧 我懂了 我懂了 你是医生的妻子
All right, I get it. I get it. You're a doctor's wife.

625
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:21,773
你知道 你得保持形象
You know, you gotta keep up appearances.

626
00:29:21,808 --> 00:29:23,206
不能跟同事一起玩乐
Can't have fun with your co-workers

627
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,736
也不能有自己的生活 我完全懂的
or a life for yourself. Totally understand.

628
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,234
好 好吧 短信告诉我地点
O-o-okay, fine.Text me where the field is,

629
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:27,933
如果我想活动下筋骨的话
and if I feel like blowing out a knee...

630
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,801
我会去的
I'll be there.

631
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:31,236
很好 可别错过了哦
All right! Hey, you're not gonna want to miss it, either.

632
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,472
比赛结束后我们再来点大麻吧
We pop a pony keg of bud after.

633
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:36,409
- 只是说说而已 - 说说而已哦
- Just sayin'. - Just sayin'.

634
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,278
请问 你知道我能在哪儿
Excuse me, do you know where I might

635
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:40,113
找到弗兰克盖拉格吗
be able to find Frank Gallagher?

636
00:29:40,148 --> 00:29:42,882
很有可能在最近的监狱或者贫民窟吧
Best bet, nearest jail or gutter.

637
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:48,122
麻烦你告诉他阿布汉姆在找他
Would you tell him that Abraham is looking for him,

638
00:29:48,157 --> 00:29:49,823
并且让他通过这个电话号码找我好吗
and that he can reach me at that number?

639
00:29:49,858 --> 00:29:53,691
额 如果有小费的话我会记得更牢哦
Uh, I remember best when I'm tipped to do so.

640
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:03,100
阿布汉姆先生 我会确保他收到你的消息的
Mr. Abraham, I will see to it that he gets your message.

641
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,502
多谢
Thank you.

642
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:16,078
- 弗兰克 这是斯科特- 嗨 弗兰克
- Frank, this is Scotty. - Hi, Frank.

643
00:30:16,112 --> 00:30:21,283
能给我们两分钟时间吗 我
Could you excuse us just one second? I--

644
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:23,152
我是不会停止操男人
I am not gonna stop fucking men

645
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:25,588
而转而去操长得像男人的女人的
to start fucking women who look like men.

646
00:30:25,622 --> 00:30:28,190
这是个部门而不是妓院
This is a ministry, not a brothel.

647
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:30,526
那些有所准备的志愿者
The volunteers who are ready

648
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,527
都已经相互组好队了
are teamed with others who are ready.

649
00:30:32,562 --> 00:30:34,930
谢谢你能在此跟我合作
Thanks for being here and doing this with me.

650
00:30:34,964 --> 00:30:36,877
斯科特和我们一起已经六个月了 
Scotty's been with us for six months of hard,

651
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:38,535
这期间她一直很认真很努力地
devoted work

652
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:40,640
想要克服她的女同性恋倾向
trying to overcome her lesbian tendencies.

653
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:42,348
你们俩要互相帮助
You're going to help each other.

654
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:44,557
这段路很长 但是我想听从上帝的旨意
It's been a long road, but I want to be right with God.

655
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:46,563
弗兰克也一样 难道不是吗 弗兰克
As does Frank. Don't you, Frank?

656
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:49,675
信仰上帝总是好的
It's always good to have God in your corner.

657
00:30:49,712 --> 00:30:53,254
这个舞台的目的就是刺激彼此
The goal of this stage is to stimulate one another,

658
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:57,534
看看刺激是否能让你们性交并达到性高潮
and see if stimulation can lead to copulation and orgasm.

659
00:30:57,568 --> 00:31:00,237
好吧 呃 你们已经迫不及待了
Okay, uh, you're anxious to go.

660
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:02,840
趁你们还没脱光我得走了
I'm gonna slip out before you slip off anything else.

661
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,442
真要这么做吗
Is this really happening?

662
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:06,344
这是上帝的旨意 上次他
God willing. The last time Alistair

663
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:08,013
带一个男人来见我时 我脱了衣服后
brought a man in to see me, he left in tears

664
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:11,049
他哭着离开了 上次我还刮毛了
after I got undressed. Last time I shave everything.

665
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:13,718
斯科特已经采取了避孕措施
Scotty has been taking birth control,

666
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:15,920
但是为了防止性病
but as an extra precaution against STDs,

667
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:17,388
还请戴上保险套吧
please use the condoms

668
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:19,222
我给你们买好放在浴室里了
I provided for you in the bathroom.

669
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:21,257
像亚当和夏娃一样 第一次在伊甸园里
Be like Adam and Eve, discovering one another

670
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:23,193
探索彼此吧
for the first time in the Garden of Eden

671
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:26,362
赤裸着探索彼此 给彼此带来
naked, discovering each other, bringing to each other

672
00:31:26,396 --> 00:31:28,765
上帝给你们准备的快乐吧
the pleasure that God intended for them.

673
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,102
不用觉得丢脸也不用觉得自责 其他一切
No shame, no guilt, no knowledge of things

674
00:31:32,136 --> 00:31:35,673
分散你们对做爱的注意力的东西都不用管
that distract us from God's love.

675
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:40,879
# 起来吧 起来吧 #
Get up, get up

676
00:31:42,915 --> 00:31:45,050
# 醒来吧 醒来吧 #
Wake up, wake up, wake up

677
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,321
# 噢 宝贝 今晚我们开始吧 #
Oh, baby, now, let's get down tonight

678
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,563
唔 我得承认你的乳房长得很漂亮
Well, I must say, you have amazing cans.

679
00:31:56,597 --> 00:31:58,398
- 以前肖恩娜也这么说过 - 肖恩娜是谁
- Shawna used to say that. - Who's Shawna?

680
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,300
一个我尽力想忘记的人
Someone I'm trying to forget.

681
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:04,905
你能帮助我忘记她吗
Will you please help me... forget her?

682
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:09,243
# 宝贝 #
And baby

683
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:11,245
# 我把持不住了 #
I can't hold it much longer

684
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,247
唔 往下面摸
Well, hello down there.

685
00:32:16,486 --> 00:32:17,958
噢 上帝也想让我们这么做
Oh, God wants this for us.

686
00:32:17,992 --> 00:32:21,264
你知道吗 也许 也许他是对的
You know what? Maybe-- maybe he's right.

687
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,100
如果你注定是个女同性恋
If you were supposed to be a lesbian

688
00:32:23,134 --> 00:32:25,269
我注定是个男同性恋的话
and I was supposed to be gay,

689
00:32:25,303 --> 00:32:26,971
他一定是软的
he'd be limp,

690
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:29,474
但是你看 我的小弟弟硬起来了
and look, my loaf of bread riseth.

691
00:32:29,508 --> 00:32:31,143
你以前曾经摸过男人的小弟弟吗
You ever felt one of those before?

692
00:32:31,177 --> 00:32:32,377
从没摸过这么老的
Never one this old.

693
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,814
谢谢
Thanks.

694
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:39,418
它就像一颗山胡桃树 一年年地长大
It's like a hickory tree. Gets stronger every year.

695
00:32:54,868 --> 00:32:56,302
你还好吗
You okay?

696
00:32:56,337 --> 00:32:59,140
- 是的 - 你今天没去学校
- Yeah. - You weren't at school today.

697
00:32:59,175 --> 00:33:01,414
噢 没去 没赶上
Oh, no, I didn't make it.

698
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:05,557
凯伦还好吗
Karen?

699
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:09,060
她情况特别糟糕
She's in pretty bad shape.

700
00:33:09,094 --> 00:33:10,929
今晚晚些时候你会过去吗
You going over there later tonight?

701
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:15,034
我不知道
I don't know.

702
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:18,104
我真的不确定
I'm not really sure.

703
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:21,780
待会你想让我过去吗
Do you want me to come over later?

704
00:33:21,817 --> 00:33:24,861
我昨晚很想你
I missed you last night.

705
00:33:24,895 --> 00:33:27,898
好的
Sure.

706
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:30,732
是的 请务必来
Yes, please.

707
00:33:33,998 --> 00:33:35,966
好的 回头见
Okay, I'll see you later.

708
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,402
好的
Okay.

709
00:33:44,576 --> 00:33:46,878
你在上面感觉怎样
How's it going up there?

710
00:33:46,912 --> 00:33:48,413
- 挺好的 - 因为 你也知道
- Fine. - Cause, you know,

711
00:33:48,448 --> 00:33:49,883
我一直看不到你的脸
I haven't seen your face for awhile,

712
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,284
而且你也说得不多
and you're not saying much.

713
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,887
- 真的挺好的 - 嗯 唔
- It's fine. - Okay, well,

714
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:54,422
我有个约定要遵守
I got an appointment that I've got to make,

715
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:57,291
我们怎样才能让你达到高潮呢
so what can we do to get you where you need to be?

716
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,759
正在尝试中
Trying.

717
00:33:58,794 --> 00:34:01,062
我能做点什么来加快你达到高潮的进程呢
Is there anything I could do to hurry it up?

718
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:03,798
我也不知道
Not sure.

719
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:08,905
你把我想象成安吉丽娜・朱莉看看
What if you were to imagine that I'm Angelina Jolie?

720
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:11,609
# 别让我一个人 #
 Don't leave me hanging

721
00:34:11,643 --> 00:34:12,844
因为你也知道 有这么些人需要
Cause you know, I got these people that need--

722
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:15,013
别说话 安吉
Shut up please, Angie!

723
00:34:16,782 --> 00:34:21,319
# 我只是想要一个能说说话的人 #
 I just want someone that I can talk to

724
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:26,125
# 我想要的就是你的本来面目#
 I want you just the way you are

725
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,265
# 我要知道你将会永远不变 #
 I need to know that you will always be

726
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:33,534
她讨厌这首歌
She hates that song.

727
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:39,540
我很抱歉 真的 
I'm sorry. I'm really--

728
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:42,042
听着 我知道你们一整天都待在这里
look, I know you're here all day,

729
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:44,044
你们也只是想要唤醒她
and you're just trying to wake her up.

730
00:34:44,078 --> 00:34:46,179
你知道的 我只是想 如果你们想要唤醒她
I just think, you know, if you want to wake her up

731
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:48,648
你们应该要做她喜欢的事 而不是她不喜欢的
you should do shit she likes, not shit she hates.

732
00:34:48,682 --> 00:34:50,350
她讨厌那首歌
She hates that.

733
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:52,286
你觉得她会喜欢什么
What do you think she would like?

734
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,457
我也不知道 呃 可能是别的什么东西吧
I don't know, uh, something else.

735
00:34:56,491 --> 00:34:59,127
我去买咖啡
I'm gonna go get some coffee.

736
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:00,561
不 乔迪 听着 我并不是故意
No, Jody, look, I didn't mean to--

737
00:35:00,596 --> 00:35:03,965
不 兄弟 你 你说得对
No, man, you're-- you're right.

738
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:06,401
你一直是她很好的朋友
You've been a good friend to her.

739
00:35:14,778 --> 00:35:16,578
情况有没有好点
Any progress at all?

740
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:19,816
唔 有时候她的脚尖会动一下
Well, she flicks her toes sometimes,

741
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,852
但是医生说这可能只是生理反射作用
but the doctor thinks it could just be reflexes.

742
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,088
嗯
Right.

743
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,225
抱歉
I'm sorry.

744
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,361
别说抱歉 我总是想
Don't be sorry. I've often thought

745
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:33,162
乔迪的演奏曲目可能会有些帮助
Jody's musical repertoire could use some updating.

746
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:36,565
不 呃 我真的很抱歉 我
No, uh, I'm sorry, I--

747
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,201
我对凯伦不够好
I wasn't very nice to Karen...

748
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:42,204
我最后一次见到她的时候
the last time I saw her.

749
00:35:42,238 --> 00:35:47,176
事实上 我 呃 我几乎是要跟她分手了
Actually, I, uh... I kind of ended it,

750
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:51,680
而且我并没有处理好
and I didn't do it very well,

751
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:54,049
我不希望那就成为她最后从我这里听到的话
and I don't want that to be the last she heard from me.

752
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:57,753
不会的
It won't be.

753
00:35:57,787 --> 00:36:02,557
我们都很乐观 会有好转的
We're thinking positive. Makes a difference.

754
00:36:02,591 --> 00:36:05,854
她会醒过来的
She's gonna wake up,

755
00:36:05,885 --> 00:36:08,549
你并没有惹她难过 利普
and you didn't make her sad, Lip.

756
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,718
当她收到你的短信的时候 她特别开心
She was so happy when she got that text from you.

757
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,621
她知道你是想发短信来跟她和解
She knew you were texting to make up.

758
00:36:14,655 --> 00:36:16,056
你应该看看她有多高兴的
You should've seen her light up.

759
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,692
- 短信 - 就在那个她去见你
- Text? - The night of the accident,

760
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:20,527
却出了车祸的晚上
when she came to meet you.

761
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:25,199
我真的感觉到她特别激动
I honestly think that she was so excited,

762
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:27,468
她只是忘了往两边看看
she just forgot to look both ways.

763
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:29,470
凯伦的手机在这里吗
Do you have Karen's phone here?

764
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:35,710
应该是跟她其他东西放在一起了
it could be with her things.

765
00:36:35,744 --> 00:36:38,012
我想 呃
I think, um...

766
00:37:12,615 --> 00:37:14,816
# 当你清早醒来 #
 When you wake up in the morning

767
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,585
够了 小妞们 走开
That's enough, girls! Walk away.

768
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:20,488
雷尼 走开
Renee, walk away.

769
00:37:20,523 --> 00:37:22,357
我一直在到处找你
I've been looking all over for you!

770
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:25,126
我手机没电了 你又没给我个充电器
My cell phone died. You didn't leave me a charger.

771
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,594
你怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

772
00:37:26,629 --> 00:37:27,964
我人脉广 弗兰克
I know people, Frank.

773
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:30,668
我放话出来了 他们打电话找的
I put the word out, they call.

774
00:37:30,702 --> 00:37:32,674
我给你找了个好点的旅馆
I got you a better hotel.

This is for the Embassy Suites, North State Street.

776
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,148
快点喝完好出发 穿好衣服
Finish your drink, head over, get dressed.

There's clean polos and khakis in the closet.

Your next gig is at the Oscar Wilde Bookstore, tonight.

779
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,490
- 好吧 - 表现利落点

嘿 我一直在找你呢

781
00:37:54,698 --> 00:37:56,065
我一直在避免被你找到呢
I've been avoiding you finding me.

782
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,900
- 妈咪 - 我感觉觉不舒服呢
- Mama. - I'm not feeling well,

783
00:37:57,934 --> 00:38:01,067
每当我感觉不舒服的时候总有坏消息出现
and when I don't feel well, it's usually bad news.

784
00:38:01,102 --> 00:38:02,802
别这样 也可能是好消息啊
No, it could be good news.

785
00:38:02,837 --> 00:38:04,638
上两次你感觉挺好的
The last two times,you felt fine

786
00:38:04,672 --> 00:38:06,506
但却是坏消息 所以这次也许是好消息
and it was bad news, so maybe this time it's good news.

787
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,240
不 不可能
No, I don't think so.

788

妈妈 我十分感谢你之前和现在
Mama, I really appreciate all you've done

789
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:16,483

it might be cold, and I don't want to wait for you.

797
00:38:32,566 --> 00:38:34,499
- 走开 - 嗨
- Get off! - Hey!

798
00:38:34,534 --> 00:38:36,567
嗨 饿了吗
Hey! Hungry?

799
00:38:36,602 --> 00:38:38,702
意大利面和面包 我做的给你留了一些

是芝加哥式的垒球 根本就不需要手套
It's Chicago-style softball. You don't need a glove.

805
00:38:51,717 --> 00:38:53,684
- 看看你 正在融入他们啊 - 嗯

806
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:56,254
我希望他们能留住我一会儿
I'm hoping they keep me around for a while.

807
00:38:56,288 --> 00:38:59,257

Come with. It should be fun. We can grab a drink after.

808
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:01,393
- 你可以见见大家 - 不错
- You can meet everyone. - Cool.

809
00:39:01,427 --> 00:39:05,560
我也许会去密歇根呆几天
Hey, I may have to spend some more time in Michigan.

810
00:39:07,923 --> 00:39:09,257
- 什么 - 医学院
- What? - Med school.

811
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,092
行政部叫我去的 他们说
Admissions Department called and said

812
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:15,697
我必须结课了 否则我将被扣掉很多学分
that I have to finish up there or I lose a bunch of credits.

813
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:18,533
我可以申请本地的学校 但如果这样的话
I can apply for schools here, but I'd basically

814
00:39:18,568 --> 00:39:22,137
我就必须从头来过 以前做的都白费了
have to start over, and lose all the work I've already done.

815
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:26,208
只要一年就好了
It's only for a year.

816
00:39:26,242 --> 00:39:27,976
我知道这有点美中不足
I know it's a bit of a fly in the ointment,

817
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:31,548
但他们能让我重新入学已经很好了
but they're being really cool, letting me re-enroll.

818
00:39:31,582 --> 00:39:35,052
- 没有别的选择了吗 - 不见得有
- There's no other option? - Not really.

819
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:36,887
不见得有还是没有
What--not really, or no?

820
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:38,388
没有
No.

821
00:39:40,991 --> 00:39:45,294
哇 这真是... 哇
Wow, that's... wow.

822
00:39:45,328 --> 00:39:47,229
- 你可以跟我一起去 - 去密歇根
- You can come with me. - To Michigan?

823
00:39:47,264 --> 00:39:48,464
也不是很远啊
It's not that far.

824
00:39:48,498 --> 00:39:49,732
孩子呢
W-- the kids?

825
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:51,233
一起来啊 如果你想的话
Yeah, sure, if you want.

826
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:55,237
- 我想的话 - 一起来 当然 他们也一起来
- If I want? - Yes, yes, of course, them too.

827
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,775
听着 有很多事情需要处理
Look, there's details to sort through,

828
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:03,682
但都是可以解决的啊 全部都可以解决
but they're all doable details,totally doable details.

829
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:07,830
啊哈 啊
Uh-huh. Uh...

830
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:11,168
我得去为打垒球做准备了
I have to get ready for softball.

831
00:40:18,242 --> 00:40:21,343
大家注意了 凯文要做爸爸了
Attention, people! Kevin is gonna be a daddy!

832
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,646
天啊
Holy shit!

833
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,880
万岁
Hooray!

834
00:40:27,582 --> 00:40:30,784
真的吗 真的吗
Really? Really?

835
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:32,486
大家来看验孕结果
Look at the stick, people!

836
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,388
你认真的吗
Are you serious?

837
00:40:37,258 --> 00:40:40,861
快看这根棒子 快看这根棒子
Look at this stick! Look at this stick!

838
00:40:40,895 --> 00:40:42,662
注意了 今天晚上
Be aware, for the rest of the night,

839
00:40:42,696 --> 00:40:45,631
我要用这根验孕棒调鸡尾酒了
I am stirring cocktails with this stick!

840
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:17,730
弗兰克 你到底在哪
Frank, where the hell are you?

841
00:41:17,764 --> 00:41:20,332
快回电话
Call me.

842
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:24,770
嗨 真不敢相信你这么快
Hey. I can't believe you texted me

843
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:26,405
就给我发信息了
for a second go around.

844
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,774
也许我回来是错误的
Maybe I made a mistake coming back.

845
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,543
- 不 不 不 别这样 - 嗯
- No, no, no, no. Come on.- Mmm.

846
00:41:29,577 --> 00:41:32,846
我们都是被异性恋的魔力吸引住的
We are heteros trapped in the demonic obsession

847
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:34,348
同性恋
of same-sex sin.

848
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:36,015
我们必须要远离那些同性恋
We must rid ourselves of the gay.

849
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,583
我们只需要继续练习
We just have to keep practicing.

850
00:41:37,617 --> 00:41:40,878
# 你如何崛起 然后又坠落 #
It's how you get up, then you fall

851
00:41:42,407 --> 00:41:45,270
加油 麦克 加油 来个全垒打
Let's go, Mike! Come on, bring us home!

852
00:41:45,304 --> 00:41:46,938
菲奥娜很喜欢垒球啊
Fiona's so into softball, huh?

853
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,604
我们需要更多这样的人 科尼
We need more of that around here, Connie.

854
00:41:48,638 --> 00:41:51,237
- 麦克 了结他 - 加油 麦克
- Mike, end this thing! - Yeah, Mike!

855
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:52,504
接下来的回合我们啤酒不够了
We don't have enough beer for extra innings.

856
00:42:05,383 --> 00:42:06,917
噢 天啊
Oh, my God!

857
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:09,118
放我下来 放我下来
Put me down! Put me down!

858
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:13,585
啤酒 我们去喝点啤酒
Beer! Let's get some beer!

859
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,950
我们要做最坏的打算了吗
Should we be planning for the worst?

860
00:42:15,982 --> 00:42:18,115
她经历过巨大的创伤
She's been through a tremendous trauma,

861
00:42:18,149 --> 00:42:20,851
但奇迹确实发生了
but I've seen miracles. They do happen.

862
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:24,288
继续和她说话
Just keep engaging with her,

863
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:27,858
做些她喜欢的事情也许会唤醒她
doing things she likes that might trigger her unconscious.

864
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:31,161
让她知道你们在这里陪着她
Let her know you're here.

865
00:42:36,235 --> 00:42:40,471
希莉娅...
Sheila...

866
00:42:40,505 --> 00:42:43,040
今晚你得回家睡会
you should go home tonight, get some sleep.

867
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:44,975
希莉娅
Sheila,

868
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,311
我觉得我们现在得轮流值班
I think we need to start taking turns

869
00:42:47,345 --> 00:42:49,613
闭上眼睛躺在床上好好睡会儿
getting some shut-eye in a real bed.

870
00:42:49,648 --> 00:42:51,115
- 我觉得 - 请别说
- I think-- - Please don't say that.

871
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,417
- 请别 - 我不会说
- Please. - I'm not saying

872
00:42:52,451 --> 00:42:54,218
- 她不会醒过来的 - 乔迪
- she's not gonna wake up.. - Jody

873
00:42:54,253 --> 00:42:58,390
我只是想说这是一场持久战 而不是短跑冲刺
I'm just saying it's a marathon, not a sprint.

874
00:42:58,424 --> 00:43:01,893
我们也要好好照顾自己 为了凯伦
We gotta start taking care of ourselves, for Karen.

875
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:07,910
你真是个王子 乔迪
You're a prince, Jody.

876
00:43:07,945 --> 00:43:09,579
别说这个
Stop.

877
00:43:09,613 --> 00:43:13,516
你真是个王子
You're like a prince.

878
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:19,189
我觉得你是她的王子
And I-- I think that you're her prince.

879
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:22,125
当她还是个小女孩的时候
When-- when she was a little girl,

880
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,130
我会给她读旧童话书里的故事
I would read to her from this old, old book of fairy tales.

881
00:43:26,164 --> 00:43:30,934
那种黑暗又老旧 扭曲而又恐怖的故事
They're dark, the old ones. They're twisted and scary,

882
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:37,709
她会握住我的手 紧紧地抓住
and she would hold my hand and squeeze it really tight

883
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:42,480
当女巫和毒苹果
when the witches and the poisoned apples--

884
00:43:42,515 --> 00:43:45,117
真爱之吻这些桥段出来的时候
and wait for the kiss of true love, and when it came,

885
00:43:45,151 --> 00:43:50,122
她就会笑着说 "妈妈 再读一次"
she would smile and say "mama, read it again."

886
00:43:50,157 --> 00:43:53,860
她长大了 我带走了她的王子
She grew up,and I took her prince.

887
00:43:53,894 --> 00:43:56,362
你是她的
You're hers.

888
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:26,161
好了 兄弟们 真是场精彩的比赛 谢谢你们把我算上
All right, cuppers, good game,guys. Thanks for having me.

889
00:44:26,195 --> 00:44:27,730
什么 不 你已经喝了
What? No, you-- what? You've had, like,

890
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:30,165
- 一半的啤酒了 - 干了剩下的
- a half of a beer. - Pound the rest of it, girl!

891
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,833
事实上 应该是"半干"
Actually, that would be "half pounding" it.

892
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:33,335
是的 是的 是的 别忘了马特叔叔的准则
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, Uncle Matt's rules.

893
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:35,838
所有球员在球赛胜利的第二天
All cuppers get to come in two hours late

894
00:44:35,872 --> 00:44:37,506
可以迟到半小时
the day after a softball victory.

895
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,173
马特叔叔鼓励酗酒哦
Uncle Matt encourages drunkenness.

896
00:44:39,207 --> 00:44:41,042
- 别这样 - 是的 跟我们一起喝吧
- Stop it. - Yeah, please, drink with us.

897
00:44:41,076 --> 00:44:42,678
我跟我哥哥说好了只待一小会
I told my brother I'd only stay for a second.

898
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:44,547
那些小屁孩得在午夜前上床睡觉
Those little ones gotta be in bed before midnight.

899
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,182
你有几个小孩
How many of those kids are yours?

900
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,517
我一个都还没生但我负责照顾所有的
I birthed none yet I'm responsible for all.

901
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:49,852
等你嫁给了那个医生
Wait until you marry the doctor,

902
00:44:49,886 --> 00:44:51,220
你就会有你自己的爱尔兰宝宝了
you'll have your own Irish brood.

903
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,358
啊 加油 兄弟们
Uh, go cuppers!

904
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,359
加油 兄弟们
Go cuppers!

905
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:57,593
干了它
Finish that.

906
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,362
- 噢 谢谢 再见 - 好吧
- Oh, thank you. Bye! - All right.

907
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:00,764
那一定就是那位医生了
That must be the doctor.

908
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:03,801
我有那么聒噪吗
Did I do that out loud?

909
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:05,102
- 有 - 好吧 兄弟们
- Yup. - All right, guys,

910
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,437
算了 算了 快别盯着看了
come on, come on, stop staring.

911
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:07,738
- 为什么 -业余者们
- Why? - Amateurs.

912
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:08,972
我们有盯着看吗
Were we staring?

913
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:10,240
比赛怎么样
How was the game?

914
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,976
三振 我得分了
Walk-off win. I scored.

915
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,784
你早就知道了 是吧
You knew, didn't you?

916
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:23,521
- 知道什么 - 密歇根
- Knew what? - Michigan.

917
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:25,256
你早就知道你会搬回去从头开始
You knew you were gonna have to move back from the beginning.

918
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,691
什么 没有
What? No.

919
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,526
请别撒谎
Please don't be the guy who lies!

920
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,394
请别撒谎
Please, don't be that guy.

921
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:34,565
是的 可能 不确定 但是的
Yes... probably. N-not for sure, but yes.

922
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,267
- 我累了 兄弟 - 菲奥娜
- I'm tired, dude. - Fiona.

923
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:38,642
- 菲奥娜 - 干嘛
- Fiona! - What?

924
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:45,466
我需要一个转机
I need a change.

925
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,801
从我这里吗
From me?

926
00:45:46,836 --> 00:45:48,639
我不是这个意思
You know that's not what I meant.

927
00:45:48,673 --> 00:45:51,277
很显然 当你决定你要告诉我
Clearly, I only know what you want to tell me

928
00:45:51,311 --> 00:45:52,746
我才知道你想说什么
when you decide you want to tell it to me.

929
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,184
我爱你
I love you.

930
00:45:56,621 --> 00:46:00,091
很好
Great.

931
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,360
黛比需要矫正器

932
00:46:02,395 --> 00:46:05,431
我煮浓咖啡 你在卖杯子
I'm making espressos, you're selling cups.

933
00:46:05,466 --> 00:46:07,267
只是一年而已
It's a year.

934
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:09,335
别说了好吗 好像这一年什么也不是
Stop saying it like a year is nothing,

935
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,472
好像这一年什么都不会发生
like nothing can happen in a year,

936
00:46:11,506 --> 00:46:14,614
好像我们离开彼此一年一点关系也没有
like being away from each other for a year wouldn't matter!

937
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:18,256
别人也这样啊
Other people do it.

938
00:46:20,761 --> 00:46:22,795
我累了
I'm tired.

939
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:24,964
明早我得早起

我会做一个好医生的
I'm gonna be a great doctor.

943
00:46:37,745 --> 00:46:39,947
我不要跟你吵
I'm not arguing that.
