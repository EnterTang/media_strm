1
00:00:00,706 --> 00:00:03,909
这些都是上周你你没看到的
<i>This is what you missed last
week on Shameless. [Spits]</i>

2
00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:05,710
你妈还没怀孕
Is your mom not pregnant again?

3
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:07,678
每次她一用验孕棒  准保是坏消息
Every time she pees on
a stick, it's bad news.

4
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:09,780
然后我就崩溃了 一直想着我老公和我妈搞在一起
And then I get depressed
thinking about my husband

5
00:00:09,814 --> 00:00:12,884
就因为我们想要
banging my mom 'cause we
selfishly want to have a baby

6
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:14,454
生出一个和我们俩都有关系的孩子
with some of our DNA.

7
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:17,094
大家注意了  Kevin要当爸爸了
Attention, people! Kevin
is gonna be a daddy!

8
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:19,598
为什么 你是说Mandy有点神经病了吗
Why, is Mandy going a little
cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

9
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:21,267
没错 我觉得 是她开车撞了Karen
Yeah, I think she ran
over Karen with her car.

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,534
- 我没有感觉  - 是Mandy干的
- I can't feel.
- Mandy did this?

11
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:26,136
就是因为我  你毁了Karen一辈子
Because of me, you ruined Karen's life!

12
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,138
我在你这么大的时候 我爸带我第一次抢劫
When I was your age, my pop
took me on my first heist.

13
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:31,075
我的同性恋养父们有挺多不错的玩意
My foster gays have a lot of nice stuff.

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,779
你有什么事吗
Whoa, can I help you?

15
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:33,880
我们有理由相信 
We have reason to believe
this child may have robbed

16
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,314
这个孩子偷了他前任养父的东西
his former foster parents.

17
00:00:35,349 --> 00:00:37,650
这些不是他干的 是我干的 把我拷上吧
He didn't do the heist. I did. Cuff me.

18
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:39,318
Mickey要娶的那个贱人
That whore that Mickey is marrying

19
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:41,720
就是一个在花园泉spa上班的婊子
is an actual whore that
works at Garden Springs spa.

20
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:43,655
你真的要和她结婚吗 
You're not seriously going
through with this, are you?

21
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:45,123
我结婚了
Just 'cause I'm getting hitched

22
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:46,290
不代表我们就不能在一起了
doesn't mean we can't still bang.

23
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:47,592
我需要改变一下自己
I need a change.

24
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:49,728
我听说了点医学院的事
I hear reports of, um, medical school.

25
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:52,332
没错 我会在密西根多待一阵子
Yeah, I may have to spend
some more time in Michigan.

26
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:53,767
你说什么
What?

27
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:54,835
你已经申请要去上学了吗
Have you signed up for classes already?

28
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,438
按要求说 我已经通过入学了
Technically I'm enrolled.

29
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:58,006
你上次见到我女儿是社么时候
And when was the last
time you saw my daughter?

30
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,644
- 两天前  - 我是两个小时以前看到她的
- Uh, two days ago.
- I saw her three hours ago.

31
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:01,745
在移民局大厅
In I.N.S. holding.

32
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,080
这些都会解决的
It will be dealt with.

33
00:01:03,114 --> 00:01:04,415
从你见到我的第一天
You have known from day one

34
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:05,683
你就应该知道
what you were getting into with me.

35
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:06,751
没错 是我搅进了你的生活
Right, I got sucked into your world.

36
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:08,187
我按你说的办事
I bent to your rules.

37
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:10,323
你让我觉得 可以相信你
You made me feel like
I could depend on you.

38
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:12,459
爷们一点 上船吧
Be a man. Get onto the boat.

39
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:14,862
嘿 是我 我爱你
Hey, it's me. I love you.

天啊  你又要把厕所炸了吗
Oh, Jesus. You hitting the crapper again?

63
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:42,857
不好意思 Frank
Sorry, Frank.

64
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:45,226
我一吃金枪鱼 就这样
Tuna casserole does it to me every time.

65
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:47,962
你就这么一个坏肚子的人
The bowels want what the bowels want.

66
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:49,697
我一会要和我的免费的律师建个面
I got a meeting with my free lawyer.

67
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:51,600
你那阵告诉我要和他说什么来着
What you told me to tell him again?


69
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:56,205
- Frank  - 怎么了
- Frank.
- What?

70
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,241
- 自我防卫  你是逼不得已的
- Public defender. Need a defense.


71
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:01,744
这个机会是上帝给你的 Julius
God gave you the race
card for a reason, Julius.

72
00:03:01,778 --> 00:03:03,579
你就应该这样做
Play it.

73
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:05,881
你还好吗  你怎么不吃早饭呢
You okay? 'Cause you
didn't eat your breakfast.

74
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:08,884
我不饿 就是有点渴
Not hungry. Thirsty.

75
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,653
你看起来不太好
You don't look good.

76
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:13,890
到这个鬼地方以后 我就一滴酒都没喝过
I haven't had a drop of booze
since I got to this place.

77
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:17,060
我连个娘们都看不到
I can't even put my hands on a goddamn oxy.

78
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:19,597
这个地方以前还是比Walgreens那强多了
Place used to be better

79
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:23,000
- 这他妈的到底是怎么了 - 条子人手少了
- What the hell happened?
- Guards cracked down.

80
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,469
这一点也不人道
Well, it's inhumane,

81
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:27,338
就像糖尿病人不能打胰岛素一样

82
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,574
是因为什么呢
And for what?

83
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,476
一个完美的抢劫
A petty robbery.

84
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:35,147
那你    他们要怎么起诉你呢
And you... what did they get you for again?

85
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:38,617
用电话把我前妻打死了
Beat my ex-wife to death with a telephone.

86
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,953
- 有线的 还是没有线的   -  手机
- Cordless or landline?
- Sidekick.

87
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,590
嘿 你好像得看医生了 哥们
Look, it looks like you
need to see a doctor, man.

88
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,359
只要他们给我一点酒
I'll be good as new if these storm troopers

89
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,829
我就什么事都没有了
would slip me a malt beverage!

90
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:54,535
监狱的暴动 就是这么来的

91
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,636
Frank!



94

嘿 Carl 你别闹了
Hey! Carl, stop it!

95
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,947
你在他妈的干什么呢
What the hell are you doing?

96
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:07,615
用手把我的牙挤到一起
Trying to push my teeth together.

97
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,718
你能带牙套 我却不能 这事一点也不公平
It's not fair that you
have braces and I don't.

98
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:11,052
我比你大
I'm older than you.

99
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:12,854
你牙套上有东西
Ew, there's food in your braces.

100
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,557
- 你得刷刷牙了  - 刷牙干屁
- You're supposed to floss.
- Flossing's for fags.

101
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:18,527
别闹了
Quit it out!

102
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:20,362
蠢货 你在家拿水枪干什么
Jackass, what are you doing
with a water gun in the house?

103
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:21,897
因为我没有彩蛋枪可以用啊
'Cause I don't have a paintball gun.

104
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:25,668
那倒是没错
Actually, that kind of makes sense.

105
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:27,703
要是搬到密西根 我可得来把彩弹枪
Gonna need a paintball gun
when we move to Michigan.

106
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:29,238
没门
Uh, no.

107
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:31,240
彩弹枪也就最多
Hell survivors paintball
field is only 5 miles

108
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:32,975
能打5米而已
outside Ann Arbor.

109
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,811
- 我们不会去密西根的  - 不会吗
- We're not going to Michigan.
- We're not?

110
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:37,046
- Fiona说我们会去的   - 没错
- Fiona said we were.
- Yup.

111
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:42,218
那是Jimmy在这的时候  你最近看到他了吗
That's when Jimmy was here.
You seen him around lately?

112
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:44,387
就是这样
Exactly.

113
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:47,524
- 那是Fiona和Jimmy分了吗  -  我不知道
- Did Fiona and Jimmy break up?
- I don't know.

114
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:49,092
我每次一提这个事 Fiona就和我喊
Fiona barks at me every time I bring it up.

115
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:50,994
我就是因为觉得再也不会见到Becky Alexander了
But I picked a fight with Becky Alexander

116
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:53,930
才狠狠的揍了她一顿
because I thought I was never
gonna have to see her again.

117
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:57,066
- 看到谁了   -  上班就穿这个吗
- See who again?
- That a new look for work?

118
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:59,068
我要是在街角那上班  就穿这身
Maybe if I was working
the street corner, yeah.

119
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:02,372
可我现在在办公室上班 最好还是把衬衫穿上
But since I'm doing data
entry, I better put this on.

120
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:05,041
今天可是个大日子 Lip
Big day today, Lip.

121
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:07,042
- 随便吧   - 不 这可不是个普通的日子
- Yeah, whatever.
- No, it's not a "whatever."

122
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:09,011
你是Gallagher家第一个拿到文凭的人
First Gallagher kid getting his diploma.

123
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:11,614
- 这是大事  - 你是隔谁那买的

我们得去参加什么SB典礼吗
We have to go to some stupid ceremony?

127
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:19,055
不 我就直接去教导处那拿到文凭
Nope, I'm picking up my diploma

128
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:20,423
然后就离开那个鬼地方
at the guidance office and
getting the hell out of there.

129
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:22,459
秋天没有典礼的
There's no ceremony in the fall.

130
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:24,027
春天的时候 他会和别人一起参加毕业典礼的

And we'll all be there to
yell, "Lip!" and embarrass him.

133
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:34,472

278
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,628
他就是按照你说的做的  你还生他的气
Well, now you're mad at him
for doing exactly what you said?

279
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:36,896
她不是这个意思
She didn't mean it.

280
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,298
- 我是这个意思
- Yeah, I did.
- Aah!

281
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,133
可就是那个晚上 不是一直啊
Yeah, but just for that night, not forever.

282
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:41,134
我不觉得他会这么想
I didn't think he'd take it for real.

283
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:43,003
为什么不呢
Why not?

284
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,504
她就是生气才那么说的
Because that's what women
do in the heat of the moment.

285
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,939
- 我们这么说 不是那个意思啊  - 我明白
- We say shit we don't mean.
- I got it.

286
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,073
可他他妈的怎么知道 Fiona是这个意思啊
But how the fuck is he
supposed to know that?

287
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:48,575
去把车拿过吧 Kev
Just go get the car, Kev.

288
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:50,310
我们约的妇产科医生  要迟到了
We're gonna be late for the baby doctor.

289
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:52,912
好吧 可我怎么知道你是不是真的想让我去拿车呢
Okay, fine, but how do I know
you really mean go get the car?

290
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:54,080
你生气的时候 会说
You could be saying, "go get the car,"

291
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:55,196
去把车拿过来  Kev
in the heat of the moment.

292
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:01,922
一年中最崩溃的时候 这学期要结束了
Crazy time of year, end of semester.

293
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:04,291
我得告诉一堆成绩不达标的孩子
I have to let a litany
of underachievers know

294
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:06,827
他们最好别再想毕业的事了
they'd best be advised to cut their losses

295
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:10,130
学点不用脑的手艺
and learn a trade, something
that utilizes their backs

296
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:14,000
以后用得上
instead of their brains. 

297
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:19,539
这个时候 才是我当老师最快乐的时候
It's moments like this
that make the job worth it.

298
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:21,608
我付出那么多  终于有回报了 
Crap pay, miserable working conditions,

299
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:27,314
给一个孩子可以改变自己命运的机会
but the chance to change
one special kid's life.

300
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:30,317
祝贺你
Congratulations.

301
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,821
Wow.

302
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,857
我觉得的 我得   谢谢你
Guess this is where I'm
supposed to, uh, thank you

303
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,192
你没有放弃我
for never giving up on me.

304
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,528
- 好吧
- Well.

305
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,234
回见 垃圾
I'll see ya, Dick. 

306
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,238
老师们在打赌你以后会怎么样 Gallagher
Teachers are taking bets
what's next for you, Gallagher.

307
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,708
上大学  10赔1  进监狱 4赔1
College, ten to one. Prison, four to one.

308
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,581
嘿 kate  能给我一杯吗
Hey, Kate, can I get a shot?

309
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,316
好让你逃课吗
And enable your truancy?

310
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,885
这个地方已经够糟心的了
This place is pathetic enough already.

311
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,253
我没逃学
I'm not skipping school.

312
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,155
事实是 他们让我毕业了
Surprisingly, they let me graduate.

313
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,391
太好了  这可算有个正经人了
Good for you. This one's on the house.

314
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:16,362
谢了
Thanks.

315
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,865
我知道你在想什么  你可以这么做
I know what you're
thinking. You can tap that.

316
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,502
可能你是对了 可你好好想想吧
And you'd be right. But chew on this.

317
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,871
没错 她是挺有手腕的
Sure, she's got some
frisky tricks up her sleeve,

318
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,607
可她可能更喜欢老屁股
but there's more tread on
those tires than it's worth.

319
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,274
相信我 上了她
Trust me, been there.

320
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,908
把我们家的旗插上  
Planted my flag and I got
the piss pins and needles

321
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:33,243
好证明我们家后继有人
to prove it.

322
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:35,110
我还以为你在监狱呢  Frank
I thought you were in jail, Frank.

323
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:38,514
我自己有办法 出来了
Got out on a technicality.

324
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:40,882
你为什么带Carl去抢劫
Why did you take the rap for Carl?

325
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,050
因为我们是一家人  我应该这么做
Because that's what family does.

326
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:45,586
- 难道我什么也没教你吗  - 祝贺你了
- Have I taught you nothing?
- Congratulations.

327
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,721
- 谢了  - 祝贺你说呢么
- Thank you.
- Congra... what for?

328
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:51,591
你儿子拿到文凭了
Your kid got his diploma.

329
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,392
我的天啊
My boy!

330
00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:57,729
你怎么没告诉我呢 我们得庆祝一下
Why didn't you say something?
We need to celebrate.

331
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:59,864
注意了 大家
Attention! 

332
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:01,565
你们这群废物
Denizens of this dump!

333
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,201
- Frank 你还好吗  - 从没这么好过
- Frank, you okay?
- Better than ever!

334
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:08,037
因为我的娃 拿到自己的文凭了
Because my progeny has joined
the ranks of the graduated!



336
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:12,475
这也让那些当官的人知道知道
Which makes official
something we've long known,

337
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:14,811
我们Gallagher家的
which is that the Gallaghers
are head and shoulders above

338
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:17,480
比你们这些垃圾强多了
all of you shitbirds! 

339
00:14:17,514 --> 00:14:19,382
说实话 Frank 你就个是垃圾
Seriously, Frank, you look like crap.

340
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,584
你也一样  我说的就是你 Tommy
Even for you. You're one to talk, Tommy.

341
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:24,488
你才是他妈的那个
You're one bucket of kfc extra crispy away

342
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:26,557
为了一包KFC薯条谁付钱  就他妈的和人分手的主
from giving precious a run for her money.

343
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:27,992
 Oh!

344
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:28,993
你知道 我有他妈的甲状腺病
You know I got a fucking
thyroid condition...

345
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:30,227
 Oh.

346
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:31,629
我现在都能把你打得 你妈都认不出来
And I could still kick your ass.

347
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:32,997
那你为什么不把你钱拿出来
Well, why don't you put your money

348
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:34,832
把你那粪坑嘴堵上呢
where your halitosis-ridden mouth is.

349
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:37,167
嘿 我可不想再擦地板上的血什么的了
Hey, I'm not mopping up the
blood and the teeth again.

350
00:14:37,202 --> 00:14:39,569
你俩看谁尿的远  把这屁事解决了
Figure out another way to
settle your pissing contest.

351
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:42,740
- 好 就看谁尿的远  - 没问题
- Fine, pissing contest!
- Fine!

352
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:44,108
开始吧
Let's go!

353
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:45,976
嘿 我就是说说而已
Hey, I didn't mean it literally!

354
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,511
那就伏地挺身
Pushups!

355
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:48,646
你连12个都做不了
You won't make double digits.

356
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,981
那有怎么样
What does it matter?

357
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,516
你压根就查不到那个数
You can't count that high anyway.

358
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,285
- 我也来   -  也算我一个
- Oh, I want in on this!
- Me too!

359
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:55,753
来吧  把这些桌子搬走
Let's do it! Push these tables aside.

360
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:57,488
- 等等  - 算我一个
- Hold on.
- Make a hole.

361
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,324
女的不能来 你也就会跪着俯卧撑吧
No girlie, on-your-knees push-ups.

362
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,625
就算有人跪着俯卧撑  Frank
Only one of us spends
time on their knees, Frank,

363
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:01,826
那人也不可能是我
and it ain't me.

364
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,294
- 好吧 我赌10刀
- Okay, 10 bucks in.

365
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:05,296
儿子拿着  我20
My kid will hold. 20!

366
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:08,433
谢了
Thank you.

367
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:11,136
谢了 谢了 好吧 购物劵不收
Thank you, thank you.
All right, no food stamps.

368
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,705
彩票可以
But lottery scratchers are accepted.

369
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,007
好吧  准备好了吗
Okay. All right, we're ready.

370
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:18,043
准备就绪
Get set!

371
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:19,511

And go!

372
00:15:19,546 --> 00:15:21,713

00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,222

00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:34,725
11, 12!

379
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,060
你知道怎么锻炼上半身的肌肉吗
Know what kind of upper body strength

380
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:37,862
扬帆就可以 Gallagher
it takes to handle a rig, Gallagher?

381
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,064
我能一天都做俯卧撑
I can do this all day.

382
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:43,201
这个不只需要力气 还需要耐力
Not just a test of strength but stamina.

383
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:46,838
耐力是成年累月积攒出来的
The kind one gets from
years of running from people,

384
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:50,642
不是你一天干18个小时 赶出来的
not sitting on your ass in
a truck for 18 hours a day.


386
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,147
27, 28, 29, 30,

387
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:59,250
31, 32! Uh-oh.


390
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:13,665
这些给你  你拿着去喝点吧
Um, there you go, uh, drink responsibly.


392
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:15,934
嘿 Kate 给我再来一杯
Hey, Kate, can I get another shot?

393
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:19,104
你想庆祝一下吗
Hey, wanna go celebrate?

394
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,006
- 吃顿牛排怎么样
- Uh...
- A steak.

395
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,841
- 算了吧 - 来吧
- No.
- Aw, come on!

396
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:26,145
你还有什么别的想法吗
You got something better to do?

397
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:30,516
去喝酒 来点龙虾吃吧
Make it a scotch and a lobster,

398
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:31,784
没问题
you got yourself a deal.

399
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:34,788
走吧
All right!

404
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,902
你好 我是Steve 有事请留言
 It's Steve. Leave some words.

406
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:30,447
你是打算永远都不接电话了吗
So you just never pick up anymore, huh?

407
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:33,950
我是Fiona
Hi. It's Fiona.

408
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:36,453
你应该还记得我吧 Fiona Gallagher
Fiona Gallagher. Remember me?

409
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:38,321
跟你约过会的那个Fiona
We used to date.

410
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:41,258
咱俩应该还没分手吧
Maybe we still do.

411
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:42,760
我今天早上给你留了一通留言
I left you a message this morning.

412
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,695
没准你听完就删掉了
You should probably just delete that.

414
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,766
还记得我说过让你滚远点吗
You know that thing I said about not coming home?

415
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,935
我其实不是那个意思
I didn't mean it.

416
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:54,504
其实也是那个意思了 不过我只是指当天晚上而已
I mean, I did mean it. Just for that night though.

417
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,107
过了一夜 我的气也就消了呀 傻瓜
Not forever, silly.

418
00:17:57,141 --> 00:18:01,312
对不起 是我自己没讲清楚啦
Sorry if I wasn't clear about that.

419
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,983
给我回电话好吗
Give me a call.

420
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,520
咱俩好好谈一谈 
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

421
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,526
我准备了小袋装的坚果和蓝莓
Okay, so I've got little baggies

422
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,230
这些东西都可以拿来补脑的
of dried nuts and blueberries,which are good brain food.

423
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,464
太好了 妈 
Great, mom, but I'm pretty sure

424
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,133
不过其实Sedona也有些这东西啦
they have all that stuff in Sedona.

425
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:26,805
可是那可是1642英里的观光路线呢
Yes, but it's 1,642 miles if you take scenic I-40.

426
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,374
再见了 Hymie 很高兴认识你
Bye, Hymie. It's been nice knowing you.

427
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,143
还有 记得找一个叫Shiva Ray的人
And you have to look up Shiva Ray.

428
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,711
我应该跟你讲过这个人
Remember I told you about him?

429
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:37,182
他是住在Sedona的一个医士
He's the medicine man that lives in Sedona.

430
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,650
我在网上看过介绍他的文章
I read about him online.

431
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,819
他只用小麦草 拿来给患者沐浴
He cured this woman's ovarian cancer

432
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,022
就治好了她的卵巢癌
by giving her wheatgrass douches.

433
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:48,193
－好的 我到了地方就去找她 －记住 是个男医士哦
- Great, I'll look her up. - Him. He's a him.

434
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,494
－他的名字叫Shiva Ray －好 我一定会去找他
- Shiva Ray. Him. - I'll look him up.

435
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,164
那我就放心了
Okay.

436
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,834
好了 全都准备妥当
All right. This is it.

437
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,837
我的天啊
Oh, my goodness.

438
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,772
我答应让你们走
I know I agreed to this, but it doesn't mean

439
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,841
可是我是真的舍不得你们
it's not hard to say good-bye

440
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,410
我的小宝贝
to my baby.

441
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:08,547
两个都是我的宝贝
Both my babies.

442
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,350
三个 三个宝贝
All three of my babies!

443
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,186
再见了 我的宝贝们
Bye, baby. 

444
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,922
宝宝乖
Shh. Okay.

445
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:21,760
宝宝乖乖
It's okay, it's okay.

447
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:27,866
Karen 小甜心
My sweet Karen.

448
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,870
妈知道 终有一天
I knew this day would come,

449
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:34,873
要放你出去闯荡天涯
when I'd be saying a proper good-bye to you.

450
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,775
虽然这和我当初所想像的情景不同
It didn't really look like this though.

451
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,310
因为我没想到
You didn't...

452
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:42,081
你要坐着轮椅 还有 还有
you didn't have a wheelchair and... and...

453
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:46,286
你头上那么大的伤疤
a big... scar on your head.

454
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:59,398
妈知道是到了该放手的时候了
I know I have to let you go.

455
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:05,304
再见
Goodbye.

456
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,673
不不 不要告别
Just stop it. No more good-byes.

457
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,677
咱们马上就又能见面了
Just see you soon.

458
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,979
－马上见 －是的 马上见
- See you soon. - See you soon!

459
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,848
－马上见 －马上见
- See you soon. - See you soon!

460
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:17,417
我的宝贝
Baby.

461
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:18,919
我们一安顿好就给您打电话
We'll call you when we get settled in.

462
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:22,923
我知道了 一定要治好我的宝贝啊
Okay. Go heal my baby.

463
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:26,226
我会的
I will.

464
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,931
再见 我的宝贝
Bye, baby.

465
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:32,999
再见 宝贝
Bye, baby.

467
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:38,938
再见 亲爱的
Bye, honey!

468
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:43,777
再见 再见喽
Bye! Bye!

469
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:46,780
妈爱你
Love you!

470
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:53,354
要不要我给你做点起司酪通心粉
Want me to make you some macaroni and cheese?

471
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:55,957
不用了 我得回去布置家里了
Uh, I have to finish getting the house ready

472
00:20:55,992 --> 00:20:57,660
今天要帮Lip办个派对
for Lip's party.

473
00:20:57,694 --> 00:21:00,196
那我去拿件外套吧 我也来帮忙
Let me grab my coat. I can come help.

474
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,265
好啊
Sure.

475
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:07,037
别担心
So don't worry, I'll make sure

476
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:08,505
我会帮你准备好一切的
that you have everything you need.

477
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,206
Lishman医生
Dr. Lishman?

478
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:13,210
嗨 Fiona
Fiona. Hi.

479
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:15,646
呃 我等会儿再过去找你们吧
Uh, I'll catch up with you guys later.

480
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,716
我很意外会在这里遇到你 你怎么了
I'm surprised to see you. Are you feeling okay?

481
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,484
没有 我只是想找您谈一谈
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.

483
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:30,059
Ian还好吗
How's Ian?

484
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:32,562
他还不错
Fine.

485
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:37,400
不知道你最近有没有跟Jimmy见面
I was wondering if you'd seen Jimmy lately?

486
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:40,003
你是指最近吗
How long?

487
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:41,871
就这个礼拜吧
Almost a week.

488
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:44,441
你们俩怎么了
You two are having problems?

489
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:47,844
我们俩有点小摩擦
Things have been a little rough lately, yeah.

490
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:50,347
Jimmy就是这样 只要事情不随他的心意
Any sign of conflict or things not going his way,

491
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:53,884
他就会跑到一边躲起来
and he just... disappears.

492
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:55,786
玩失踪
Gone.

493
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,587
－你加辣吗 －什么
- Chipotle? - What?

494
00:21:57,622 --> 00:21:59,923
我吃热狗一般都会加点墨西哥辣酱
I always have my hot dog with a little chipotle sauce.

495
00:21:59,957 --> 00:22:02,191
－你也要点吗 －好的 谢谢
- You want some? - Yeah, sure. Thanks.

496
00:22:02,226 --> 00:22:05,628
Rosa 两份特餐 加辣
Rosa, two specials. Chipotle.

497
00:22:05,662 --> 00:22:09,531
他就是这样 我都已经习惯了
It's what he does. I've gotten used to it.

498
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:11,266
反正他一个月也不会打个电话或是写通E-mail给我
At least as used to it as a father can when his son

499
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:15,938
所以我也习以为常了
doesn't call or email for months at a time.

500
00:22:15,972 --> 00:22:18,040
－给你 －谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

501
00:22:18,074 --> 00:22:22,545
没准这次他不会再玩消失了呢
Maybe this time's different?

502
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:24,246
是有这个可能啦
Absolutely.

503
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:29,051
这种事谁也不知道 不是吗
Yeah, you never know, right?

504
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:33,122
不好意思 我要回去工作了
I should get back to work.

505
00:22:33,157 --> 00:22:37,060
别太担心啦
You'll be fine.

506
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:40,964
谢谢你请的热狗
Thanks for the hot dog.

507
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:48,839
好了 现在能看清了 只有核桃那么一点大
All right, there we go. There's the little peach pit.

508
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:52,075
我的妈呀 这就是吗
Holy crap, there he is!

509
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,610
看他长得跟你多像呀 宝贝
He looks just like you, baby.

510
00:22:53,645 --> 00:22:55,512
就是啊 就是啊 是不是
He kind of does, doesn't he?

511
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:57,247
医生 现在能看出是男孩还是女孩吗
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl, doc?

512
00:22:57,282 --> 00:23:00,017
现在才12周 要再等一个月才能看得出来
12 weeks is too early to tell. Give it another month.

513
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:01,485
12周 你是不是算错了
12 weeks? That's impossible.

514
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,120
我们总共也才试了12周而已啊
But we only started trying 12 weeks ago.

515
00:23:03,154 --> 00:23:04,855
那就说明你们第一次就中啦
Then it must have happened on the first go-around.

516
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:07,924
我把它打印出来 正好你可以把衣服穿起来
Let me print this up, and I'll let you get dressed.

517
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,494
咦 怎么感觉怪怪的
Ooh, yeah, that's weird.

518
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:16,099
按道理讲 我一怀孕马上就能感觉出来才对
My body usually tells me when I'm pregnant.

519
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:20,471
以前可没发生过这样的事情
You know, it's never been wrong before.

520
00:23:20,505 --> 00:23:23,841
不知道这次是怎么了
Wonder what happened this time.

521
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:31,049
－你在干什么呢 －我要去预备役军官训练团报名
- What are you doing? - ROTC retreat.

522
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,551
－什么时候去 －就现在
- Since when? - Last minute.

523
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:36,954
－看到我的刀了吗 －什么刀
- Hey, where's my knife? - I don't know.

524
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:41,058
S.O.G军刀 Carl 我好不容易才弄到的
Carl, my S.O.G. Seal team. It's the best fixed blade I got.

526
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:48,032
我的武士刀坏了 修好之前 总得有把刀来防身吧
My samurai sword broke. Need a backup till it's fixed.

528
00:23:51,036 --> 00:23:52,970
如果你不在的时候 活死人复苏怎么办
What if the zombie apocalypse goes down while you're gone?

529
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:57,675
谁来保护Debbie和Liam呀
Who's gonna protect Debbie and Liam?

530
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:59,811
－算了 给你吧 －真的吗
- Fine, keep it. - Really?

531
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:02,580
不过你要答应我 不能用在人的身上
Yeah, just promise you're not gonna use it on anything human.

532
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:07,152
－猫又不是人类 －只要是活的就不行 知道吗
- Cats aren't human. - Anything living. Promise.

533
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:11,155
知道了 那你可以教我怎么用吗
Promise. Can you teach me the different hand grips?

534
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:14,558
－当然可以 －太好了
- Sure. - Thanks.

535
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,498
－慢点啊 －怀了整整12个礼拜
- Hold on, now. - 12 weeks pregnant!

536
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:23,000
Veronica 你听我说 我真的不知道我自己怀孕了
Veronica, I promise. I swear I had no idea.

537
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:24,368
你们两个 等会儿
Ladies, please.

538
00:24:24,403 --> 00:24:26,004
V 别这样 那可不对啊
Hey, V, come on, that's not right.

539
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:27,872
这一定要录下来才行
Although, hey, I should probably record this

540
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:29,774
到时候可以上传到咱俩的网站上赚点击率
in case we want to upload it to our site,

541
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:31,909
不过动手前记得要盯着她的肚子
make some money, just watch her belly if you're gonna hit her.

542
00:24:31,944 --> 00:24:33,211
都已经12个礼拜了 Kev
12 weeks, Kev?

543
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:34,612
冷静一点好吗 宝贝
Just trying to keep the peace, baby.

544
00:24:34,646 --> 00:24:35,613
宝贝 真的 我发誓我真的不知道
Honey, I promise, I didn't know!

545
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:36,714
算了吧 你自己心里有数
Please, you always know.

546
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:37,949
你自己就是根验孕棒
You're like a walking pee stick!

547
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:38,950
过去真的是这样 可是这次
Yeah, in the past, but this time...

548
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:40,785
别跟我说这次
There is no "this time."

549
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,686
你假装不知道 还不就是为了跟我老公多打几炮吗
You kept quiet 'cause you wanted to keep fucking my husband!

550
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:44,721
看什么看 有他妈什么好看的
What the fuck are you looking at, huh?

551
00:24:44,756 --> 00:24:46,290
我他妈怀不上孩子
My husband fucked my mother to get pregnant.

552
00:24:46,324 --> 00:24:48,625
所以我老公要跟我妈打炮 让她怀上我们的种
Sorry we can't all have our baby the normal way!

553
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,093
嘿 我要说什么才好呢
Hey, what can I say?

554
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:52,295
找个白种男人 从此你就紧致水嫩
Once you go white, you always stay tight.

555
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,798
不对 我这么说怎么好像是在羞辱我自己呢
Hey, I think I just insulted myself.

556
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:59,235
－妈 你就承认吧 －是 是
- Mom, admit it. - Okay.

557
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,804
我是觉得我自己可能怀上了
Okay, I thought I might be pregnant!

558
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:01,805
－我的老天爷呀 －但是 宝贝
- Oh, my God. - No, but, honey.

559
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,206
但是我不确定
Look, I didn't know.

560
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:04,775
我自己也没验孕
I didn't take a test or anything.

561
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:06,976
－因为我不想知道结果 －什么 为什么
- I didn't want to know. - What? Why?

562
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:09,279
因为我很喜欢现在这种状态
Because I liked what we had.

563
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:11,081
－谢谢 －你说什么
- Thank you. - Excuse me?

564
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:14,551
不是 不是咱们三个人的那种关系 我是指这种家的感觉
No, not what we, me and Kev had, what we all had.

565
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:16,753
－你到底在说些什么呀 －我最近真的好孤单呀
- What are you talking about? - Been feeling so lonely lately.

566
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:18,321
是你来找我帮忙
And when you called me to help out,

567
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:19,756
我才知道 原来我自己还有存在的价值
it made me feel wanted...

568
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,326
知道原来这个家还需要我 
wanted in a loving way, in a family way,

569
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,831
重视我 爱着我
needed, important.

570
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:29,299
嘿 我是你们的小婴胎
Hey, I'm your baby fetus.

571
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:32,435
不要再吵了 好吗
Please don't fight anymore.

572
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,970
我知道Kev是多么的炙手可热
I know Kev is a big, hot stud,

573
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:37,640
他鸡巴那么大 是谁都不能拒绝这种诱惑
and you couldn't resist his giant cock penis.

574
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:40,811
但现在我才是最重要的人 好吗
But I'm all that matters now, right?

575
00:25:48,152 --> 00:25:51,620
等了半天都没有人来给我续杯
What does it take to get a refill around here?

576
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:56,425
如果你穿得人模狗样 再系条领带 可能就容易多了
Jacket and tie would probably help.

577
00:25:56,459 --> 00:25:59,328
这样真是太好了 我们太久没这样好好的相处了
This is nice. We don't spend enough time together.

578
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:01,030
我们压根就没好好相处过吧
No, we don't spend any time together.

579
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:02,965
没错 我就是这个意思
Exactly my point.

580
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,804
儿子 你知道吗 其实我一直都在这里
You know, son, you can always come to me.

581
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,273
谢谢了 老爸
Thanks, dad.

582
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:13,043
－我真的很担心你 －呵呵 是吗
- I worry about you. - Is that right?

583
00:26:13,077 --> 00:26:14,645
不管你长到多大
A parent's plight never goes away,

584
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,481
在老爸的眼里 你始终是个孩子
no matter how old your kid gets.

585
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:21,619
看看你 都18岁了
Look at you, 18 now.

586
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:25,322
都已经高中毕业了
A high school graduate.

587
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,794
服务生到底他妈死哪儿去了
Where the fuck is that waiter?

588
00:26:29,828 --> 00:26:32,530
又开始跟我打马虎眼了吗
Don't go getting misty-eyed on me now.

590
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:37,835
要不要老爸给你一些忠告
Need any words of fatherly advice?

591
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:39,971
－没关系 我自己来就好 －别这样啦
- No, I think I got it covered. - Oh, come on, come on!

592
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:44,676
你现在在想什么
What's on your mind?

593
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,345
随便了 反正今天已经够出奇的了
Okay, why not? Day couldn't get any weirder.

594
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:51,849
嗯 我决定不再继续上学了
Um, I'm done with school.

595
00:26:51,884 --> 00:26:54,051
不过目前
I have no idea what I'm gonna do

596
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:57,854
我还没有任何的打算
today or tomorrow

597
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:00,156
以后的事就更没想过了
or for the rest of my life.

598
00:27:00,191 --> 00:27:02,525
什么计划都没有吗
So no plans?

599
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,228
没有
No.

404
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,902
你好 我是Steve 有事请留言
It's Steve. Leave some words.

406
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:30,447
你是打算永远都不接电话了吗
So you just never pick up anymore, huh?

407
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:33,950
我是Fiona
Hi. It's Fiona.

408
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:36,453
你应该还记得我吧 Fiona Gallagher
Fiona Gallagher. Remember me?

409
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:38,321
跟你约过会的那个Fiona
We used to date.

410
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:41,258
咱俩应该还没分手吧
Maybe we still do.

411
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:42,760
我今天早上给你留了一通留言
I left you a message this morning.

412
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,695
没准你听完就删掉了
You should probably just delete that.

414
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,766
还记得我说过让你滚远点吗
You know that thing I said about not coming home?

415
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,935
我其实不是那个意思
I didn't mean it.

416
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:54,504
其实也是那个意思了 不过我只是指当天晚上而已
I mean, I did mean it. Just for that night though.

417
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,107
过了一夜 我的气也就消了呀 傻瓜
Not forever, silly.

418
00:17:57,141 --> 00:18:01,312
对不起 是我自己没讲清楚啦
Sorry if I wasn't clear about that.

419
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,983
给我回电话好吗
Give me a call.

420
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,520
咱俩好好谈一谈 
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

421
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,526
我准备了小袋装的坚果和蓝莓
Okay, so I've got little baggies

422
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,230
这些东西都可以拿来补脑的
of dried nuts and blueberries,which are good brain food.

423
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,464
太好了 妈 
Great, mom, but I'm pretty sure

424
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,133
不过其实Sedona也有些这东西啦
they have all that stuff in Sedona.

425
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:26,805
可是那可是1642英里的观光路线呢
Yes, but it's 1,642 miles if you take scenic I-40.

426
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,374
再见了 Hymie 很高兴认识你
Bye, Hymie. It's been nice knowing you.

427
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,143
还有 记得找一个叫Shiva Ray的人
And you have to look up Shiva Ray.

428
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,711
我应该跟你讲过这个人
Remember I told you about him?

429
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:37,182
他是住在Sedona的一个医士
He's the medicine man that lives in Sedona.

430
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,650
我在网上看过介绍他的文章
I read about him online.

431
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,819
他只用小麦草 拿来给患者沐浴
He cured this woman's ovarian cancer

432
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,022
就治好了她的卵巢癌
by giving her wheatgrass douches.

433
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:48,193
－好的 我到了地方就去找她 －记住 是个男医士哦
- Great, I'll look her up. - Him. He's a him.

434
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,494
－他的名字叫Shiva Ray －好 我一定会去找他
- Shiva Ray. Him. - I'll look him up.

435
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,164
那我就放心了
Okay.

436
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,834
好了 全都准备妥当
All right. This is it.

437
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,837
我的天啊
Oh, my goodness.

438
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,772
我答应让你们走
I know I agreed to this, but it doesn't mean

439
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,841
可是我是真的舍不得你们
it's not hard to say good-bye

440
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,410
我的小宝贝
to my baby.

441
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:08,547
两个都是我的宝贝
Both my babies.

442
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,350
三个 三个宝贝
All three of my babies!

443
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,186
再见了 我的宝贝们
Bye, baby. 

444
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,922
宝宝乖
Shh. Okay.

445
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:21,760
宝宝乖乖
It's okay, it's okay.

447
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:27,866
Karen 小甜心
My sweet Karen.

448
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,870
妈知道 终有一天
I knew this day would come,

449
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:34,873
要放你出去闯荡天涯
when I'd be saying a proper good-bye to you.

450
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,775
虽然这和我当初所想像的情景不同
It didn't really look like this though.

451
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,310
因为我没想到
You didn't...

452
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:42,081
你要坐着轮椅 还有 还有
you didn't have a wheelchair and... and...

453
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:46,286
你头上那么大的伤疤
a big... scar on your head.

454
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:59,398
妈知道是到了该放手的时候了
I know I have to let you go.

455
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:05,304
再见
Goodbye.

456
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,673
不不 不要告别
Just stop it. No more good-byes.

457
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,677
咱们马上就又能见面了
Just see you soon.

458
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,979
－马上见 －是的 马上见
- See you soon. - See you soon!

459
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,848
－马上见 －马上见
- See you soon. - See you soon!

460
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:17,417
我的宝贝
Baby.

461
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:18,919
我们一安顿好就给您打电话
We'll call you when we get settled in.

462
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:22,923
我知道了 一定要治好我的宝贝啊
Okay. Go heal my baby.

463
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:26,226
我会的
I will.

464
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,931
再见 我的宝贝
Bye, baby.

465
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:32,999
再见 宝贝
Bye, baby.

467
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:38,938

468
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:43,777
再见 再见喽
Bye! Bye!

469
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:46,780
妈爱你
Love you!

470
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:53,354
要不要我给你做点起司酪通心粉
Want me to make you some macaroni and cheese?

471
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:55,957
不用了 我得回去布置家里了
Uh, I have to finish getting the house ready

472
00:20:55,992 --> 00:20:57,660
今天要帮Lip办个派对
for Lip's party.

473
00:20:57,694 --> 00:21:00,196
那我去拿件外套吧 我也来帮忙
Let me grab my coat. I can come help.

474
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,265
好啊
Sure.

475
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:07,037
别担心
So don't worry, I'll make sure

476
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:08,505
我会帮你准备好一切的
that you have everything you need.

477
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,206
Lishman医生
Dr. Lishman?

478
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:13,210
嗨 Fiona
Fiona. Hi.

479
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:15,646
呃 我等会儿再过去找你们吧
Uh, I'll catch up with you guys later.

480
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,716
我很意外会在这里遇到你 你怎么了
I'm surprised to see you. Are you feeling okay?

481
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,484
没有 我只是想找您谈一谈
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.

483
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:30,059
Ian还好吗
How's Ian?

484
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:32,562
他还不错
Fine.

485
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:37,400
不知道你最近有没有跟Jimmy见面
I was wondering if you'd seen Jimmy lately?

486
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:40,003
你是指最近吗
How long?

487
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:41,871
就这个礼拜吧
Almost a week.

488
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:44,441
你们俩怎么了
You two are having problems?

489
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:47,844
我们俩有点小摩擦
Things have been a little rough lately, yeah.

490
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:50,347
Jimmy就是这样 只要事情不随他的心意
Any sign of conflict or things not going his way,

491
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:53,884
他就会跑到一边躲起来
and he just... disappears.

492
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:55,786
玩失踪
Gone.

493
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,587
－你加辣吗 －什么
- Chipotle? - What?

494
00:21:57,622 --> 00:21:59,923
我吃热狗一般都会加点墨西哥辣酱
I always have my hot dog with a little chipotle sauce.

495
00:21:59,957 --> 00:22:02,191
－你也要点吗 －好的 谢谢
- You want some? - Yeah, sure. Thanks.

496
00:22:02,226 --> 00:22:05,628
Rosa 两份特餐 加辣
Rosa, two specials. Chipotle.

497
00:22:05,662 --> 00:22:09,531
他就是这样 我都已经习惯了
It's what he does. I've gotten used to it.

498
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:11,266
反正他一个月也不会打个电话或是写通E-mail给我
At least as used to it as a father can when his son

499
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:15,938
所以我也习以为常了
doesn't call or email for months at a time.

500
00:22:15,972 --> 00:22:18,040
－给你 －谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

501
00:22:18,074 --> 00:22:22,545
没准这次他不会再玩消失了呢
Maybe this time's different?

502
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:24,246
是有这个可能啦
Absolutely.

503
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:29,051
这种事谁也不知道 不是吗
Yeah, you never know, right?

504
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:33,122
不好意思 我要回去工作了
I should get back to work.

505
00:22:33,157 --> 00:22:37,060
别太担心啦
You'll be fine.

506
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:40,964
谢谢你请的热狗
Thanks for the hot dog.

507
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:48,839
好了 现在能看清了 只有核桃那么一点大
All right, there we go. There's the little peach pit.

508
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:52,075
我的妈呀 这就是吗
Holy crap, there he is!

509
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,610
看他长得跟你多像呀 宝贝
He looks just like you, baby.

510
00:22:53,645 --> 00:22:55,512
就是啊 就是啊 是不是
He kind of does, doesn't he?

511
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:57,247
医生 现在能看出是男孩还是女孩吗
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl, doc?

512
00:22:57,282 --> 00:23:00,017
现在才12周 要再等一个月才能看得出来
12 weeks is too early to tell. Give it another month.

513
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:01,485
12周 你是不是算错了
12 weeks? That's impossible.

514
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,120
我们总共也才试了12周而已啊
But we only started trying 12 weeks ago.

515
00:23:03,154 --> 00:23:04,855
那就说明你们第一次就中啦
Then it must have happened on the first go-around.

516
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:07,924
我把它打印出来 正好你可以把衣服穿起来
Let me print this up, and I'll let you get dressed.

517
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,494
咦 怎么感觉怪怪的
Ooh, yeah, that's weird.

518
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:16,099
按道理讲 我一怀孕马上就能感觉出来才对
My body usually tells me when I'm pregnant.

519
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:20,471
以前可没发生过这样的事情
You know, it's never been wrong before.

520
00:23:20,505 --> 00:23:23,841
不知道这次是怎么了
Wonder what happened this time.

521
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:31,049
－你在干什么呢 －我要去预备役军官训练团报名
- What are you doing? - ROTC retreat.

522
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,551
－什么时候去 －就现在
- Since when? - Last minute.

523
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:36,954
－看到我的刀了吗 －什么刀
- Hey, where's my knife? - I don't know.

524
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:41,058
S.O.G军刀 Carl 我好不容易才弄到的
Carl, my S.O.G. Seal team. It's the best fixed blade I got.

526
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:48,032
我的武士刀坏了 修好之前 总得有把刀来防身吧
My samurai sword broke. Need a backup till it's fixed.

528
00:23:51,036 --> 00:23:52,970
如果你不在的时候 活死人复苏怎么办
What if the zombie apocalypse goes down while you're gone?

529
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:57,675
谁来保护Debbie和Liam呀
Who's gonna protect Debbie and Liam?

530
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:59,811
－算了 给你吧 －真的吗
- Fine, keep it. - Really?

531
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:02,580
不过你要答应我 不能用在人的身上
Yeah, just promise you're not gonna use it on anything human.

532
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:07,152
－猫又不是人类 －只要是活的就不行 知道吗
- Cats aren't human. - Anything living. Promise.

533
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:11,155
知道了 那你可以教我怎么用吗
Promise. Can you teach me the different hand grips?

534
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:14,558
－当然可以 －太好了
- Sure. - Thanks.

535
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,498
－慢点啊 －怀了整整12个礼拜
- Hold on, now. - 12 weeks pregnant!

536
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:23,000
Veronica 你听我说 我真的不知道我自己怀孕了
Veronica, I promise. I swear I had no idea.

537
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:24,368
你们两个 等会儿
Ladies, please.

538
00:24:24,403 --> 00:24:26,004
V 别这样 那可不对啊
Hey, V, come on, that's not right.

539
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:27,872
这一定要录下来才行
Although, hey, I should probably record this

540
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:29,774
到时候可以上传到咱俩的网站上赚点击率
in case we want to upload it to our site,

541
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:31,909
不过动手前记得要盯着她的肚子
make some money, just watch her belly if you're gonna hit her.

542
00:24:31,944 --> 00:24:33,211
都已经12个礼拜了 Kev
12 weeks, Kev?

543
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:34,612
冷静一点好吗 宝贝
Just trying to keep the peace, baby.

544
00:24:34,646 --> 00:24:35,613
宝贝 真的 我发誓我真的不知道
Honey, I promise, I didn't know!

545
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:36,714
算了吧 你自己心里有数
Please, you always know.

546
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:37,949
你自己就是根验孕棒
You're like a walking pee stick!

547
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:38,950
过去真的是这样 可是这次
Yeah, in the past, but this time...

548
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:40,785
别跟我说这次
There is no "this time."

549
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,686
你假装不知道 还不就是为了跟我老公多打几炮吗
You kept quiet 'cause you wanted to keep fucking my husband!

550
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:44,721
看什么看 有他妈什么好看的
What the fuck are you looking at, huh?

551
00:24:44,756 --> 00:24:46,290
我他妈怀不上孩子
My husband fucked my mother to get pregnant.

552
00:24:46,324 --> 00:24:48,625
所以我老公要跟我妈打炮 让她怀上我们的种
Sorry we can't all have our baby the normal way!

553
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,093
嘿 我要说什么才好呢
Hey, what can I say?

554
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:52,295
找个白种男人 从此你就紧致水嫩
Once you go white, you always stay tight.

555
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,798
不对 我这么说怎么好像是在羞辱我自己呢
Hey, I think I just insulted myself.

556
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:59,235
－妈 你就承认吧 －是 是
- Mom, admit it. - Okay.

557
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,804
我是觉得我自己可能怀上了
Okay, I thought I might be pregnant!

558
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:01,805
－我的老天爷呀 －但是 宝贝
- Oh, my God. - No, but, honey.

559
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,206
但是我不确定
Look, I didn't know.

560
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:04,775
我自己也没验孕
I didn't take a test or anything.

561
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:06,976
－因为我不想知道结果 －什么 为什么
- I didn't want to know. - What? Why?

562
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:09,279
因为我很喜欢现在这种状态
Because I liked what we had.

563
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:11,081
－谢谢 －你说什么
- Thank you. - Excuse me?

564
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:14,551
不是 不是咱们三个人的那种关系 我是指这种家的感觉
No, not what we, me and Kev had, what we all had.

565
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:16,753
－你到底在说些什么呀 －我最近真的好孤单呀
- What are you talking about? - Been feeling so lonely lately.

566
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:18,321
是你来找我帮忙
And when you called me to help out,

567
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:19,756
我才知道 原来我自己还有存在的价值
it made me feel wanted...

568
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,326
知道原来这个家还需要我 
wanted in a loving way, in a family way,

569
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,831
重视我 爱着我
needed, important.

570
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:29,299
嘿 我是你们的小婴胎
Hey, I'm your baby fetus.

571
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:32,435
不要再吵了 好吗
Please don't fight anymore.

572
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,970
我知道Kev是多么的炙手可热
I know Kev is a big, hot stud,

573
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:37,640
他鸡巴那么大 是谁都不能拒绝这种诱惑
and you couldn't resist his giant cock penis.

574
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:40,811
但现在我才是最重要的人 好吗
But I'm all that matters now, right?

575
00:25:48,152 --> 00:25:51,620
等了半天都没有人来给我续杯
What does it take to get a refill around here?

576
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:56,425
如果你穿得人模狗样 再系条领带 可能就容易多了
Jacket and tie would probably help.

577
00:25:56,459 --> 00:25:59,328
这样真是太好了 我们太久没这样好好的相处了
This is nice. We don't spend enough time together.

578
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:01,030
我们压根就没好好相处过吧
No, we don't spend any time together.

579
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:02,965
没错 我就是这个意思
Exactly my point.

580
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,804
儿子 你知道吗 其实我一直都在这里
You know, son, you can always come to me.

581
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,273
谢谢了 老爸
Thanks, dad.

582
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:13,043
－我真的很担心你 －呵呵 是吗
- I worry about you. - Is that right?

583
00:26:13,077 --> 00:26:14,645
不管你长到多大
A parent's plight never goes away,

584
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,481
在老爸的眼里 你始终是个孩子
no matter how old your kid gets.

585
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:21,619
看看你 都18岁了
Look at you, 18 now.

586
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:25,322
都已经高中毕业了
A high school graduate.

587
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,794
服务生到底他妈死哪儿去了
Where the fuck is that waiter?

588
00:26:29,828 --> 00:26:32,530
又开始跟我打马虎眼了吗
Don't go getting misty-eyed on me now.

590
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:37,835
要不要老爸给你一些忠告
Need any words of fatherly advice?

591
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:39,971
－没关系 我自己来就好 －别这样啦
- No, I think I got it covered. - Oh, come on, come on!

592
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:44,676
你现在在想什么
What's on your mind?

593
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,345
随便了 反正今天已经够出奇的了
Okay, why not? Day couldn't get any weirder.

594
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:51,849
嗯 我决定不再继续上学了
Um, I'm done with school.

595
00:26:51,884 --> 00:26:54,051
不过目前
I have no idea what I'm gonna do

596
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:57,854
我还没有任何的打算
today or tomorrow

597
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:00,156
以后的事就更没想过了
or for the rest of my life.

598
00:27:00,191 --> 00:27:02,525
什么计划都没有吗
So no plans?

599
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,228
没有
No.

600
00:27:05,262 --> 00:27:08,030
挺好的  你跟我真像
Good for you. You're just like me.

601
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:10,599
咱俩与众不同啊
We march to the beat of a different drummer.

602
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,902
每个人都想抓着你
Everyone will try to cage you in,

603
00:27:12,936 --> 00:27:14,504
告诉你你得考虑自己的将来
tell you you have to worry about your future.

604
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:17,039
你知道你的将来应该是怎样的吗
You know what your future should be?

605
00:27:17,074 --> 00:27:20,076
就像这样  充实活过每一天啊
This... living life to the fullest,

606
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,012
就像是你的最后一天那样
every day like it's your last.

607
00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:26,916
只来这个地方实在是不够啊
This place is single-handedly lowering my tolerance.

608
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,851
咱们去卖酒的地吧
Let's hit the liquor store.

609
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:31,187
你真的觉得
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, um, you really think

610
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:33,389
他们这种服务也值得你花辛苦钱吗
they deserve your hard-earned money for that service?

611
00:27:33,424 --> 00:27:35,558
-吃霸王餐  -吃了就跑
- Dine and dash? - Bite and bolt.

612
00:27:35,593 --> 00:27:39,296
-吃了就跑  -我走前门
- Eat it and beat it? - I'll take the front door.

613
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:44,133
抱歉  朋友  洗手间在哪儿
Excuse me, amigo, uh, bano?

614
00:27:44,168 --> 00:27:48,571
谢谢
Gracias.

615
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,107
抱歉 我一定要接这个电话
Excuse me, I gotta take this call.

616
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:55,645
- 我能看一下你们的甜品菜单吗  - 当然
- Can we see a dessert menu? - Of course.

617
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:10,660
Fiona  午饭的时候没见到你呢
Hey, Fiona, missed you at lunch.

618
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:12,294
这堆人在Mike的办公室外面做什么
What are all these people doing outside Mike's office?

619
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:14,663
- 应聘  - 非常感谢
- Job applicants. - Thanks so much, man, okay?

620
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:15,931
我们会在这周后期联系你
We'll talk to you later this week.

621
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:17,333
当然
You bet.

622
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:18,934
抱歉  我能跟你说点事吗
Hi. Uh, sorry. Can I talk to you for a second?

623
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:20,969
当然
Yeah, uh, sure.

624
00:28:21,004 --> 00:28:22,504
- 有空缺的职位是吗  - 是啊
- There's a job opening up? - Yeah.

625
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:24,673
销售部的Rick要去哥伦比亚的办事处了
Rick from sales is moving to our Columbus office.

626
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:26,909
我想要这个工作
Well, I want it.

627
00:28:26,943 --> 00:28:28,644
不行  我得找有经验的人
No, I need somebody with experience.

629
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,915
就是因为那天晚上在帐篷里的事
This is about our night in the tent.

630
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,754
- 我保证不是  - 可我已经在这干了好几个月了
- I can assure you it is not. - But I've been here for months.

631
00:28:37,788 --> 00:28:39,456
我得临时工作快到期了  我也准备好了
My temp position's ending, and I'm ready.

632
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,124
我也很想让你继续在这工作
I would love to keep you around,

633
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,493
但是Matt大叔是不会让我雇佣一个
but Uncle Matt's not gonna let me hire someone

634
00:28:42,527 --> 00:28:43,961
没有可靠业绩的人的
who doesn't have a proven track record.

635
00:28:43,995 --> 00:28:47,131
但是门外这些人都有  好吗
Which all those people out there do, okay?

636
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,800
听着  如果你哪怕只有一次销售成功的经历
Listen, if you had one sale on the books,

637
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:51,936
这就大不相同了
this would be a different conversation.

638
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,604
我卖过鸡尾酒  这也算啊
I've pushed cocktails, that's sales.

639
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,139
等等  你不是要搬去密歇根吗
Wait, weren't you moving to Michigan?

640
00:28:55,173 --> 00:28:56,540
你不是想要去我们安阿伯市办事处工作吗
I mean, you wanted to work in our Ann Arbor office.

641
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:57,775
而且我还说服了
And I convinced all those customers

642
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:59,510
你们以为快没戏的客户
you thought you lost to re-up.

643
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:01,345
你是提起了他们的兴趣  但是是销售部门的人
You got them on the hook, but it was the sales department

644
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,417
最后完成了交易
that closed the deals.

646
00:29:10,155 --> 00:29:12,156
你对公司做出了很大贡献
You've been a great asset to this company.

647
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:16,694
我很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

648
00:29:21,032 --> 00:29:24,301
我还记得我第一次带你来这儿的事
I remember the first time I brought you here.

649
00:29:24,336 --> 00:29:26,837
去你的  你从来没带我滑过冰
Fuck you! You never took me skating.

650
00:29:26,871 --> 00:29:30,340
我经常带你去滑冰  还有去公园  动物园
Always took you skating, to the park, to the zoo.

651
00:29:30,374 --> 00:29:32,309
你还想偷乌龟来着
You tried to make off with a tortoise.

652
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:33,844
那是你
That was you.

653
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:38,181
那玩意在濒临灭绝物种市场里 行情好着呢
Huh. Good market in endangered species.

654
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:40,884
因为那是非法的  Frank
That's 'cause it's illegal, Frank.

655
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:42,686
- 心碎的环保纳粹啊
- Bleeding heart eco-fascist.

656
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:45,689
适者生存  这是有原因的
It's called survival of the fittest for a reason.

657
00:29:45,724 --> 00:29:48,326
不想濒临灭绝的话  就给我快点进化
You don't want to be endangered, speed the fuck up!

658
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,163
- 长几根对生拇指吧
- Grow some opposable thumbs!

659
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:54,099
不然 你就只能变成eBay上值10刀的东西了
Otherwise you end up on eBay for 10 grand,

660
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,401
就像达尔文想的那样
as Darwin intended.

664
00:30:01,273 --> 00:30:04,575
- 犀牛的话更贵  - 啥
- More for a rhino. - What?

665
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:07,010
它们的角  在亚洲的话足够支付一个国王的赎金了
Horn. Pay a king's ransom in Asia.

666
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:10,581
碾成粉末  有白痴说这能治好癌症
Grind it into powder. Morons say it cures cancer.

667
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:12,349
还有虎鞭
Also tiger dick.

668
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:13,784
他们吃了几口  就以为
They take a couple of bites, and they think it turns them

669
00:30:13,818 --> 00:30:16,520
自己能变成性交机器了
into fuck machines. 

670
00:30:16,554 --> 00:30:19,522
我可不是瞎掰出来的
I'm not making this shit up!

671
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:23,026
我靠  这地真滑
Oh, shit! This is slippery. Whoo!

672
00:30:23,061 --> 00:30:24,528
- 我得  靠  - 好吧
- I'm gonna... shit! - All right.

673
00:30:24,562 --> 00:30:26,096
好了  走吧  走吧
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

675
00:30:28,566 --> 00:30:32,135
- 我们应该经常这么干  - 午后酒友
- We should do this more often. - Afternoon drinking buddies?

676
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,639
我们明天能去动物园  偷出来
We could hit the zoo tomorrow. Steal it.

677
00:30:35,673 --> 00:30:38,942
- 什么  - 犀牛角啊
- What? - The rhino horn.

678
00:30:38,976 --> 00:30:40,610
一起去
Do it together.

679
00:30:40,644 --> 00:30:45,248
- 你这废物  - 酒精能让我们保持清醒
- You're fucking wasted. - Alcohol provides clarity.

680
00:30:45,283 --> 00:30:47,818
我们就躲在候鸟避难所里直到动物园关闭
We hide in the bird sanctuary until closing.

681
00:30:47,852 --> 00:30:49,486
然后给犀牛下药
We drug the rhino.

682
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:52,990
它一倒下  马上用锯子把角锯下来
Once it's down, a quick back and forth with the saw.

683
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:55,459
然后我们就在拍卖网上点几下手指就好了
And we're a few clicks away from a bidding war.

684
00:30:55,494 --> 00:30:56,928
你说啥
What do you say?

685
00:30:56,962 --> 00:30:59,163
- 不不不不不
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

686
00:30:59,198 --> 00:31:02,267
你可不是从男女同校的学校放春假的学生
You're not some co-ed on spring break.

687
00:31:02,301 --> 00:31:05,137
Gallagher家的人不会吐的  快停下 
Gallaghers do not puke! Oh, stop!

689
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:11,443
- 神啊
- Oh, God.

690
00:31:11,477 --> 00:31:13,845
多米诺骨牌效应
Domino effect!

693
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:26,189
你们两个赶紧出去
You two are out of here right now!

694
00:31:26,223 --> 00:31:29,692
- 他没事吧  - Frank  Frank
- He okay? - Frank? Frank!

695
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:32,796
Barry  快叫救护车
Barry, I need an ambulance.

696
00:31:38,302 --> 00:31:39,836
有什么可以帮忙的吗
Can I help you?

697
00:31:39,871 --> 00:31:41,104
伙计  难道你不知道在大街上
Dude, don't you know it's not cool

698
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:44,608
冲向独自一人的女人很不好吗
to rush a woman alone on the street?

699
00:31:44,643 --> 00:31:46,977
他想给你这个
He wanted you to have this.

700
00:31:47,012 --> 00:31:48,679
谁  这他妈的是谁
Who? What the hell is that?

701
00:31:48,713 --> 00:31:52,383
和你一起住在这里的那个人
The man who lived here with you.

702
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:55,119
Jimmy?

703
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,958
等等  等等
Wait! Hey, wait!

704
00:32:00,993 --> 00:32:03,361
他刚在在这儿吗  他现在在哪
Was he here? Where is he?

705
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:05,530
他还说了什么别的吗
Hey, did he say anything else?

706
00:32:05,564 --> 00:32:10,402
有  他说他配不上你
Yes, he said you were too good for him.

707
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:14,839
他已经放下了  你也得这样
He has moved on. Now so must you.

710
00:32:20,513 --> 00:32:24,316
拜托了  嘿
Come on! Hey!

712
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:32,089
Lip  怎么了
Lip, what's going on?

713
00:32:40,532 --> 00:32:42,032
你好  我是Fiona Gallagher
Hi, I'm Fiona Gallagher.

714
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:44,001
我的父亲Frank Gallagher刚才入院了
My father Frank Gallagher was just admitted.

715
00:32:44,035 --> 00:32:46,003
- 我查查  - 他怎么了
- Let me check. - What's wrong with him?

716
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:48,505
你是说这次吗 是我就不会担心 他可是Frank啊
You mean this time? I wouldn't worry, it's Frank.

717
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,540
- 我猜他得了癌症  - 除非得癌症给钱
- I bet he has cancer. - Only if there's money in it.

718
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:52,709
第一个路口左转  右手边第四间房
First left, fourth door on the right.

719
00:32:52,744 --> 00:32:54,945
谢谢
Thanks.

720
00:32:56,614 --> 00:32:57,580
在这等着  好吗
Stay here, okay?

721
00:32:57,615 --> 00:32:59,282
- 什么  - 不
- What? - No.

722
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:01,017
等着  我知道了什么会马上告诉你们的
Yes, I'll tell you as soon as I know anything.

723
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:03,285
不要  我很讨厌你总把我当小孩儿对待
No, I'm sick of you treating me like a little baby.

724
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,921
- 我也是  - 好了  去大厅里等着
- Me too. - Okay. Go wait in the lobby.

725
00:33:05,956 --> 00:33:09,558
现在就去
Now!

727
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:17,601
您好  请问您刚才是在我父亲的病房吗
Hey, uh, were you just in there with my father?

728
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:20,070
- Francis Gallagher  - 没错
- Francis Gallagher? - I was.

729
00:33:20,105 --> 00:33:22,707
您能告诉我发生了什么事吗
Well, can you tell me what's going on?

730
00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:24,776
我刚才都告诉他了  他倒是淡定地接受了
Just broke the news to him. Took it in stride.

731
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:28,614
可我觉得他其实还没明白是怎么回事
Although I don't think he's truly accepting it yet.

732
00:33:28,648 --> 00:33:31,984
什么事实  淡定地接受了什么
What... what news? Took what in stride?

734
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:40,559
100美元之内
Under $100.

736
00:33:42,195 --> 00:33:43,962
- 嗨  - 嘿  很高兴你能来
- Hi, there. - Hey! I'm glad you're here.

737
00:33:43,997 --> 00:33:45,897
能帮我多要点这些布丁吗
Try to get me some more of these pudding cups, would you?

738
00:33:45,932 --> 00:33:49,768
- 不  别提吃的  - 天啊  Lip  拜托了
- No! Don't mention food! - Oh, Jesus, Lip! Really?

739
00:33:49,802 --> 00:33:51,603
你到底是喝了多少啊
It smells like a distillery in there.

740
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:53,339
我们去庆祝毕业了
Celebrating my graduation.

741
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:55,575
大白天的跟他出去喝得烂醉
Getting drunk in the middle of the day with him?

742
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:57,310
你是白痴吗
Are you an idiot?

743
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:59,746
拜托你等我明天头没那么痛了
Please save the mommy lecture for tomorrow, please,

744
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,615
再跟我来这套老妈谈话
when my head isn't pounding so much.

745
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,150
站起来  回家  清醒起来
Get up, get home. Get sober.

746
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:06,320
我们给你弄了个惊喜派对
We're planning a surprise party for you.

747
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:07,855
已经不是惊喜了  我早就知道了
It's not a surprise, I already knew.

748
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:09,289
Debbie和Carl在大厅里等着
Well, Debbie and Carl are waiting in the lobby.

749
00:34:09,323 --> 00:34:10,824
带他俩回家
So take them with you. 

750
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:12,292
这可不好玩
This isn't gonna be fun.

751
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:13,993
是啊  把你的惊喜冰激凌奶油蛋糕
Yeah, and grab your surprise ice cream cake

752
00:34:14,028 --> 00:34:15,027
从冰箱里拿出来解冻
out of the freezer and start defrosting it.

753
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:17,663
- 好吧
- Okay.

754
00:34:17,698 --> 00:34:20,833
三个生鸡蛋  伍斯特沙司  再加一片姜
Three raw eggs, worcestershire, and a sliver of ginger.

755
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:22,601
解酒最有用了
Works every time.

756
00:34:22,635 --> 00:34:26,838
我的天  没有HBO  没有Showtime  只有普通的有线电视
Jesus. No HBO, no Showtime. Just basic cable.

757
00:34:26,873 --> 00:34:30,475
Tosh 2.0是什么玩意儿
And what the hell is a Tosh 2.0?

758
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:32,544
- 医生跟你说过了是吗  Frank  - 是啊
- The doctor talk to you, Frank? - Yeah.

759
00:34:32,578 --> 00:34:33,945
"叭叭叭叭叭叭  不能再喝酒
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, stop drinking.

760
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,547
叭叭叭叭叭叭"
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

761
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:38,550
他跟我说你真的病得很严重
He told me you were really sick.

762
00:34:38,585 --> 00:34:41,120
你觉得我病得严重吗
Do I look really sick to you?

763
00:34:41,154 --> 00:34:43,289
他说你吐血了
Said you were throwing up blood.

764
00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:45,057
那是因为我有太多血在身体里了
That's 'cause I've got too much of it in me.

765
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:46,692
这是个过滤的过程
It's a filtration process.

766
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:48,961
我的身体知道该怎么样把脏东西排出来
My body knows how to flush itself out.

767
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:50,963
别开玩笑了  这很严重
Stop joking. This is serious.

768
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:53,399
他就是个江湖医生
It's just doctor mumbo jumbo

769
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:55,968
骗你去多做点检查而已
to scare you into taking more tests.

770
00:34:56,002 --> 00:34:59,638
- 该死的寄生虫  - 你想干嘛
- Fucking parasites. - What are you doing?

771
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:03,141
- 我要去厕所  - 去找护士吧
- I gotta use the can. - Well, let's get the nurse.

772
00:35:03,176 --> 00:35:05,310
我不喜欢现在值班的那个护士  她很胖
I don't like the one that's on duty. She's fat.

773
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,512
帮我推着那个好吗
Roll that thing behind me, will you?

776
00:35:11,284 --> 00:35:14,053
他说你如果再喝酒的话 你就快死了
He said if you don't stop drinking, you're gonna die.

777
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:16,389
真的是死
As in dead, you know,

778
00:35:16,423 --> 00:35:19,192
不再活着了  知道吗  而且很快会死
like, no longer living? And soon.

779
00:35:19,227 --> 00:35:24,198
你什么时候开始关心我了
When did you start to care?

780
00:35:24,232 --> 00:35:27,268
我不确定我关不关心
Not sure that I do.

781
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:30,771
我曾经梦想着你去死
I've dreamt about your death.

782
00:35:30,806 --> 00:35:34,041
把钱放到募捐箱里的时候祈祷过
Put money in a collection box and prayed for it.

783
00:35:34,076 --> 00:35:39,280
吹生日蜡烛的时候祈祷过
Blew out my birthday candles, wished for it.

784
00:35:39,314 --> 00:35:42,350
如果这真的发生了的话
If it actually ever happened,

785
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:46,921
我不知道我是会感到解脱还是愧疚
I don't know if I'd feel relief or guilt.

786
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:50,425
你的生日蜡烛
Your birthday candles?

788
00:35:52,994 --> 00:35:54,528
有一次我还给圣诞老人写信
I wrote a letter to Santa once.

790
00:35:58,399 --> 00:35:59,866
所以我就不应该再喝酒了
So I'm supposed to stop drinking

791
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,904
这样 你就不会有愧疚感了
so that you don't feel guilty?

792
00:36:04,939 --> 00:36:06,406
不是
No.

793
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,908
你不应该再继续喝酒
You're supposed to stop drinking because you have

794
00:36:07,942 --> 00:36:09,776
因为家里还有爱着你的孩子们
children at home who love you.

795
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:12,078
我也不知道为什么他们爱你
And I don't know why.

796
00:36:12,113 --> 00:36:14,814
如果你发生了什么事 他们会崩溃的
Who would be destroyed if anything happened to you.

797
00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:17,883
坏事能让孩子们更坚强  Fiona
Tragedy makes kids tough, Fiona.

798
00:36:17,918 --> 00:36:20,386
那就为了你自己这个大自恋狂
Then be the fabulous narcissist that you are,

799
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,489
你去戒酒吧
and do it for yourself.

800
00:36:26,593 --> 00:36:32,131
如果我不想改变呢
What if I don't want to change?



801
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:35,901
那就是我一直最害怕的事情发生了
Then I would know what
I've always feared is true.

802
00:36:35,936 --> 00:36:38,437
什么事
What is that?

803
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:41,941
就是你根本一点都不在乎我们
That you don't give a shit about any of us.

804
00:36:45,512 --> 00:36:47,914
为了你自己
So do it for you.

805
00:36:47,948 --> 00:36:50,950
为了你的孩子们
Do it for your kids.

806
00:36:50,985 --> 00:36:55,589
那都无所谓
It doesn't matter.

807
00:36:55,623 --> 00:36:58,859
你戒酒吧
Do it.

808
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:01,862


809
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:05,266


810
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,869
♪ yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

811
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:11,039
♪ yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

812
00:37:11,073 --> 00:37:15,142


813
00:37:18,313 --> 00:37:21,715
嘿 今天你去哪了 没见你去学校
Hey, where were you today?
I didn't see you at school.

814
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,284
有点事要处理
Something came up.

815
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:25,552
老师给我们圣诞假期留了作业
They gave us homework
over the Christmas break.

816
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:27,955
我告诉Stoltz老师 上帝可不想
I told Mrs. Stoltz that Jesus
didn't want us celebrating

817
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:30,191
用他妈的读书来庆祝他生日
his birthday by fucking reading.

818
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:32,360
你想拿你那份作业吗
You want the assignments?

819
00:37:32,394 --> 00:37:35,196
- 我就是想过来看看你 - 谁他妈的敲门
- Just came by to see you.
- Who's at the goddamn door?

820
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,965
是找我的 混蛋
It's for me, shithead!

821
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,968
我弄了些硝石 给你拿过来
Got some nitrous. I'll go get it.

822
00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:50,812

826
00:38:04,794 --> 00:38:06,829
我老婆让我把那些纳粹的东西都摘下来了
Wife made me take all my Nazi shit down.

827
00:38:06,863 --> 00:38:09,866
她恨纳粹
She hates Nazis.

828
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,768
显然俄国佬们对待二战和德国人
Apparently the Russians
kicked some serious kraut ass

829
00:38:11,802 --> 00:38:13,903
的态度挺严肃的 所以…
in world war II, so...

830
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:15,906

She can drink me under
the fucking table, man.

831
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,976
真稀奇
It's weird.

832
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:23,881
那个…
Anyways...

833
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:26,351
她明晚要工作
she's working tomorrow night.

834
00:38:26,385 --> 00:38:28,687
要不我们还和以前一样
Why don't we pick up where we left off?

835
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:30,689
反正她也在外面干别的男人
Figure she's gonna be out fucking dudes.

836
00:38:30,723 --> 00:38:33,691
为什么我不行

Ah! Right. You gotta be 18.

843
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:53,543
是 不过我能想办法处理一下
Yeah, I figured a way around that.

844

848
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:11,326
你期望什么 我求你不要走？
What are you hoping, I tell you not to go?

849
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:15,497
我像个小姑娘一样的在后面追你？
I'm gonna chase after you like some bitch?

850
00:39:15,531 --> 00:39:18,634
我来这不是为了见你的
Didn't come here for you.

851
00:39:21,304 --> 00:39:24,540
别
Don't.

852
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:31,079
- 别什么？ - 别...
- Don't what?
- Just...

853
00:39:43,224 --> 00:39:47,527
我拿到硝石了 外面见
I got the nitrous. Meet you outside.

854
00:39:47,562 --> 00:39:50,163
好

855
00:39:54,402 --> 00:39:56,303
你TM的想干什么
What the fuck do you want?

856
00:39:56,338 --> 00:40:01,074
就这样  这就是你最想对他说的
Really? That's all you're gonna say to him?

857
00:40:03,745 --> 00:40:06,913
你他妈的就是个娘们
You're a fucking pussy.

858
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:20,462
- 怎么了 - 哦 嘿 我刚喂完Liam
- What's going on?
- Oh, hey, I fed Liam.

859
00:40:20,497 --> 00:40:22,297
半个小时前把他哄睡着了
And put him down a half an hour ago.

860
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:23,832
- 谢了 - 爸爸怎么样

861
00:40:23,867 --> 00:40:26,135
- 他还好么  - 那看他自己了
- Is he okay?
- That's up to him.

862
00:40:26,169 --> 00:40:27,669
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

863
00:40:27,704 --> 00:40:28,971
我们应该留在医院照顾他
We should be at the
hospital helping him out.

864
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:31,740
- 他需要自己帮自己  - 什么
- He needs to help himself.
- What?

865
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:34,310
你们怎么不装饰房间了
What's up with taking down the decorations?

866
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:35,645
Lip说不用的
Lip told us to.

867
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,346
没人有心思开派对了
No one feels much like a party.

868
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:41,217
嘿 有时候生活就是会把你绊倒
Hey, sometimes life throws
a couple swings at you.

869
00:40:41,251 --> 00:40:43,352
但是我们是Gallagher 对吗
But we're Gallaghers, okay?

870
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:46,189
有两件事我们最擅长
And there's two things
that we're really good at...

871
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:50,360
知道怎么找支援和怎么开派对
knowing how to get back up
and knowing how to party.

872
00:40:50,394 --> 00:40:53,162
所以你去把胶带拿过来 把条幅挂上
So you get the tape, start
hanging up that banner.

873
00:40:53,197 --> 00:40:55,198
你去叫Kev和V

874
00:40:55,232 --> 00:40:57,000
Sheila 开始准备吃的

来庆祝你毕业后开始崭新生活了
Hell of a way to start
life after graduation.

882
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:19,521
- 那东西在哪呢 - 什么

- What?

883
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:22,190
那张纸
The piece of paper.

884
00:41:22,225 --> 00:41:25,127


885
00:41:35,404 --> 00:41:37,706
我当初都不敢确定你能得到这个
I wasn't actually sure you'd ever get this.

886
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,442
这代表了我们两个人的努力
That makes two of us.

887
00:41:40,476 --> 00:41:43,845
我为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

888
00:41:51,453 --> 00:41:53,922
我今天拿到些钱
I came into some money.

889
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:55,723
你可以自己留下 你怎么不告诉我啊
Bury the lead, why don't you?

890
00:41:55,758 --> 00:41:58,126
我用一些付了房租和水电
I put a bunch away for rent and gas,

891
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,095
但是剩下的我想做点别的
but there's something I
want to do with the rest.

892
00:42:00,129 --> 00:42:01,730
拜托千万别告诉我你又要办什么夜店 晚会了
Please don't tell me you're gonna promote

893

894
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:05,000
嗯 这次是别的事
Mm, something else.

895
00:42:05,034 --> 00:42:09,137
没准可以弄个全职工作
Could get a full-time job out of it.

896
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:11,573
你说行就行 你能帮我把门关上么
If I say okay, will you
close the fucking door?

897
00:42:11,608 --> 00:42:14,910
