1
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:12,865
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,127
Oh.

3
00:00:14,418 --> 00:00:17,118
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

4
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,621
I just need some clean clothes.

5
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,874
You know your way.

6
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:47,514
Yeah. 

7
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,842
That was all.

8
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,460
You know the dangers of starting to box again.

9
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,616
Let me worry about that. 

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,537
You don't want anything to do 
with my life for now, right?

11
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:03,494
Okay.

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,767
I'm sorry for bothering you. Next time I'll knock.

13
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:30,066
Hey, Olli.

14
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:32,018
I urgently need an espresso.

15
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,301
I want to surprise Marlene with a design for a suit. 

16
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:39,163
A fancy dress for her first stage show.

17
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:41,548
What do you think?

18
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:46,537
Classic-conservative or rather provocative-sexy?

19
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,389
Olli?

20
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:53,508
When did he stop talking?

21
00:01:53,508 --> 00:01:55,913
Do you know what a shitty feeling it is?

22
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:59,382
To come home to an empty apartment 
where nobody's waiting for you?

23
00:01:59,446 --> 00:02:01,086
You ran into Christian.

24
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:03,593
He was here earlier and picked up some stuff.

25
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:04,794
And? Did you talk?

26
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:07,038
No! And I wouldn't know what about.

27
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:09,563
We're having stress and he immediately 
hops into bed with Jessica.

28
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:13,577
But I've accused him of that so many times,
I can't even hear it myself anymore.

29
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:20,493
I thought a bit of distance would be good for us, but...

30
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:22,277
Everything reminds me of him. 

31
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:23,907
The books, the cups... - Olli.

32
00:02:24,888 --> 00:02:28,385
You have to take another step. Get past this. 

33
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:31,124
I know it's easier said than done, but...

34
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:34,025
Deal with your memories. 

35
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,714
How am I supposed to do that? 

36
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:40,512
Make sure that a new phase 
can begin between the two of you.

37
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,182
Without these memories 
standing in your way all the time.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,694
Come on in.

39
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:22,088
Olli?!

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,996
It's you. Hey.

41
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:27,471
I'm sorry for interrupting, but... it's important.

42
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:29,080
Has a package arrived for me?

43
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,280
No, this is your stuff.

44
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,480
The rest is outside.

45
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,586
W...W...What do you mean "my stuff". 
What's that all about?

46
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:36,926
I'm sorry, Christian, but there is no other way.

47
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:41,025
I can't think about you and our relationship 
if I constantly come in contact with your things.

48
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:42,541
I simply can't cope.

49
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,381
Well, it looks to me like you 
want to end our relationship.

50
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:46,494
No.

51
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:50,961
But I realized that it's not enough 
for you to move out, 

52
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:54,798
while our whole life and all our stuff
is in the apartment.

53
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,206
I'm sorry.
