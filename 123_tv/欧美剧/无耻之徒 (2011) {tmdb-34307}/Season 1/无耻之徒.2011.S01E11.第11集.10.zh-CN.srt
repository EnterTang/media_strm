1
00:00:52,207 --> 00:00:54,280
上帝会对那些站在左边的人说
Then God will say to those on the left: 

2
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:58,025
远离我 你们永远都会被诅咒
"Depart from me, ye cursed,   

3
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,644
那是为恶魔和他的使徒准备的
into everlasting life that was prepared for the devil and his angels.

4
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:04,569
当我饥饿的时候 你什么都没有给我吃
For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat.

5
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,852
当我渴的时候 你什么都没有给我喝
I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink.

6
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:10,954
我对于是一个陌生人 你不会带上我
I was a stranger and you did not take me in.  

7
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:13,752
当我赤裸的时候 你没有给我衣服穿
I was naked and you did not clothe me.

8
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,772
当我生病的时候 你没有照顾我
I was sick and you did not tend me. 

9
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,358
当我在监狱的时候 你没有来看望我
I was in prison and you did not visit me."

10
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:23,374
然后他们会说 主啊
And they will say, "Lord, 

11
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,773
我们什么时候没能做到这些事呢
when did we fail to do these things?"

12
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:27,480
于是主会回答道
And the Lord will reply:

13
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:30,444
哪怕是最小的一件事情
"Whatever you failed to do for the least of men 

14
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:32,498
只要你没有为我做 就算你没做到
you failed to do for me." 

15
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:35,250
这些人会被卷入永不熄灭的火中受难
And they will go away to everlasting fire 

16
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:38,070
而正义则会永久长存
while the righteous will have eternal life.

17
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:40,220
谢谢你 莱特斯
Thank you, Letters.

18
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:42,095
他们是在我们抛尸的那个位置吗
Are they where we dumped the body?

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,512
当时天色很暗
It was dark.

20
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:46,868
全能的上帝啊
God Almighty.

21
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:51,890
我能告诉你们我为什么爱这个地方吗
Shall I tell you what I love about this place?

22
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,280
他们看到马斯顿了
They have seen Marston!

23
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:56,145
可以吗
Shall I?

24
00:01:56,395 --> 00:01:58,195
他们在那里什么也看不到
There is nothing to see.

25
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,300
谁愿意帮我建一座教堂呢 谁
Who will help me build a church, who? 

26
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:01,685
莱特斯·莫洛伊愿意 上帝
Letters Molloy, Lord!

27
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,070
莱特斯·莫洛伊愿意 上帝
Letters Molloy, Lord. 

28
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:09,019
你最渴望的是什么呢 莱特斯
And the thing which you most desire, Letters?

29
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:11,950
在我死前能再看一眼塔沙湖
To see Dri-shane Lake once more before I die.

30
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:15,184
你会的 因为上帝会满足你最大的愿望
And you shall! Because god will grant your dearest wish. 

31
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,820
他能清楚地听到你的声音
He will hear you loud and clear.


32
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,205
我们完了
We are finished.

33
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,251
还有谁 还有人原意帮我建造教堂吗
Who else, who else will help me build a church?

34
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:21,092
是我们完了
We?

35
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:22,888
威廉·斯塔宾斯愿意 上帝
William Stubbins, Lord.


36
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:23,793
只有我
I am. 

37
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:25,716
威廉·斯塔宾斯愿意 上帝
William Stubbins, Lord! 

38
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:26,967
我完了
I am finished.

39
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:30,315
“我就是复活 就是生命”
I am the resurrection and the light. 

40
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:35,514
“信我的人 虽然死了 也必复活”
He who believes in me even though he dies shall live.

41
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:40,075
“凡活着信我的人 必永远不死”
Whoever lives and believes in me shall never die.

42
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,202
听不到你们说什么
Cannot hear you!

43
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,862
尘归尘 土归土
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 

44
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:46,467
要相信这些知识是关于
Be sure of certain knowledge of the ...

45
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:48,879
我们听不到
We cannot hear you!!

46
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:50,099
他在喊他们过去
He’s telling them to come ... amen. 

47
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:52,067
阿门

莎拉·帕金森 长官

你为什么选萨拉·帕金森
Why did you prefer Sarah Parkinson,

94
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,853
那个丑陋又满嘴脏话的老巫婆

95
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:43,786
而不选凯瑟琳·麦克维蒂呢

to reappear only when it was her lover's turn to choose. 

101
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,015
她的爱人会因此被枪毙的
It would get her lover shot?

102

我只剩下大概一个小时可以活了
I only have an hour or so left to live 

120
00:06:09,148 --> 00:06:13,475
我要尽情享受这一个小时

121
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:35,046
对不起 你不用害怕
I am sorry. Please do not be frightened.

122
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:36,655
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

123
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,815
他的朗姆酒放在哪儿
Where does he keep his rum?

124
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,051
是他让你来拿的吗
Has he sent you for it?

125
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:41,906
算是吧 在哪呢
In a way. Where is it?

126
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,582
那边
Over there.

127
00:06:57,078 --> 00:06:58,178
这酒是给谁的
Who is that for?

129
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,082
我
Er, me.

130
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,613
你打算偷喝总督的朗姆酒吗
You intend to drink the Governor's rum?

131
00:07:06,638 --> 00:07:07,288
对
Yes

132
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:08,582
他会因此而把你绞死的
He will hang you for it.

134
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,130
他们说的那些是真的吗
Is it true what they say?

135
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:14,477
他们说什么了
What do they say?

136
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:17,095
你和总督在一起了
You and the Governor.

137
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,210

他们找到了什么东西
They have found something.

149
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:16,938
尸体吗
The body?

150
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,531
有可能
Perhaps.

151
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,012
总督的酒
The Governor's.

152
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,110
你偷了总督的朗姆酒
You stole the Governor's rum?

153
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:34,801
他还能把我绞死两次吗
Can he hang me twice?

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,190
柯林斯上尉
Captain Collins.

155
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:40,655
早安 长官
Good morning sir!

156
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,230
我们的渔网 长官 已经被撕成碎片了
Our nets, Sir. They have been ripped to shreds.


157
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,547
被鲨鱼吗
Sharks?

158
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,285
当地人
Natives.

159
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,093
他们肯定认为我们抢了他们太多的鱼
 They must think we take too much fish with them.

160
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:52,986
太好了
Yes

161
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,110
太多吗 我们基本捕不到东西
Too much? We hardly catch anything.

162
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,444
尽管这样
Nevertheless.

163
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,231
该死的
Shit!

164
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:06,600
糟糕
Oh no!  

165
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,344
之前那么神气
So cocky before. 

166
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:37,998
现在却又这么胆小
So timid now.

167
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:40,004
我之前以为我走投无路了
I thought I had nothing to lose 

168
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,194
但其实没有
but I have.

169
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,899
求你别告诉总督 别绞死我
 Please do not tell the Governor. Please do not hang me.

170
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:51,584
你做了什么被送到这儿来
What did you do to end up here?

171
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:55,886
这会影响你的决定吗
Will that affect your decision?

172
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:58,141
是的
Yes

173
00:09:58,418 --> 00:09:59,664
那样的话
In that case . 

174
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:01,915
我死定了
I am doomed.

175
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,009
我只是
I, am ... 

176
00:10:07,337 --> 00:10:09,207
一个扒手
a pickpocket

177
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,822
如果我同意帮你
If I agree, 

178
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,264
你会帮我做点事作为回报吗
will you do something for me in return?

179
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,279
是的
Yes

180
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:18,736
不管什么时候
Whenever 

181
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:20,346
只要你听到有人议论我和总督的事
you hear anyone talk about me and the Governor, 

182
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,670
你会对他们澄清一下吗
will you put them straight?

183
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:22,567
我会的
Yes

184
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:25,191
总督并没有把我的丈夫派到开普敦
The Governor did not send my husband to Cape Town. 

185
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:26,470
他是自愿去的
He volunteered 

186
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,390
我也永远不会背叛他
and I would never betray him.

187
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:30,999
我会跟他们澄清事实的 我保证
I will put them straight, I promise.

188
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,009
很好
Very well.

189
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,960
我同意不告诉总督了
I agree not to tell the Governor.

190
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,835
弗里曼
Freeman!  

191
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:49,984
他在哪
Where is he?

192
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,595
事情已经解决了
It is taken care of.

193
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,938
你们又把马斯顿挖出来了吗
You dug up Marston again?

194
00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:54,051
跟你没关系
That is none of your concern.

195
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:55,251
我们都是在一条船上的
We are in this together.  

196
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,451
你把他挖出来了吗
Have you dug him up?

197
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:58,491
只能这样 不然狗也会把他挖出来的
We had to or the dogs would have done it for us. 

198
00:10:58,516 --> 00:11:00,455
我们没法把他埋得很深
We could not dig him in deep.

199
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,203
他现在在哪
Where is he now?

200
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,997
海底 被他自己做的锁链沉下去了
The bottom of the sea. Weighed down with his own chains.

201
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:11,934
我们
We er, 

202
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,650
我们发誓会保持沉默
we all swore an oath of silence.

203
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,369
这有必要吗
Was that necessary?

204
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,268
你会告发我们吗
Would you grass on us?

205
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,660
不会
No

206
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,130
矮子呢
Stubby?

207
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,195
不会
No

208
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,495
莱特斯呢
Letters?

209
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:29,411
不会
No

210
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:30,270
谁会 谁会
Anyone? Anyone? 

211
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:31,041
不会 不会
No.No

212
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,282
没有人 既然我这么信任你们
So why the oath 

213
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:35,633
还有必要发誓吗
if I am already sure of you?

214
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,443
矮子
Stubby.

215
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,629
我们想让你和总督谈谈
We want you to speak to the Governor.

216
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,727
谈什么
What about?

217
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:46,825
削减配给粮的事
This cut in the rations.

218
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,490
以此报答你们的沉默吗
In return for your silence?

219
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:51,276
我们的沉默是无偿的 伊丽莎白
Our silence is a given, Elizabeth.

220
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:53,490
你去向总督抗议 你是一个被定性的人
You complain to the Governor, you are a marked man.

221
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:55,410
他已经给你贴了标签了
He has already marked you:

222
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:57,331
一个愿意为原则而死的男人
a man ready to die for a principle. 

223
00:11:57,356 --> 00:11:58,946
他尊重你
He has respect for you.


224
00:11:58,971 --> 00:12:01,241
你是唯一能告诉他的人
You are the only one that can tell him.

225
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:02,971
你知道他会说什么吗
You know what he will say? 


226
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,219
“你太把自己当回事了 巴伦特
"Getting above yourself Barrett. 

227
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,170
虽然我之前没有绞死你
Because I did not hang you, 


228
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:08,505
但现在我会
so now I will, 

229
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,965
你这个口无遮拦 傲慢自大
you big-mouthed, big-headed,  

230
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,227
蛊惑人心的白痴”
rabble rousing fool."

231
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:14,035
不 不 不 他会为此感激你的
No, no, no. He will thank you for it. 

232
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,629
你得告诉他这次减少配给
You tell him that this cut in the rations 

233
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,557
会将他和所有的士兵置于危险之中
endangers him and all the soldiers.

234
00:12:17,582 --> 00:12:18,531
为什么这么说
How?

235
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:21,483
我们被统治是因为我们接受统治
We are governed because we allow ourselves to be governed. 

236
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,921
我们有一千人 他们只有区区一百人
A thousand of us and a hundred of them? 

237
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:26,170
如果我们想造反他们一点办法都没有
They won’t stand a chance if we chose to rebel.

238
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:27,505
他会把这话当成是威胁
He will see that as a threat.

239
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,040
他会把这当成一个
He will see it as a word 

240
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:32,335
来自他所尊敬的人的提醒
of warning from a man that he respects

241
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,495
你这样想吗
You think so?

242
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,655
是的 我这样想
Yes I do.

243
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:36,531
那你去告诉他
Then you tell him.

244
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,210
您要见我吗 教士
You want me, Reverend?

245
00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:42,475
是的
Yes

246
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:54,602
如果我妻子来了
If my wife comes, 

247
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:58,015
你就说你是来取要洗的衣服的 好吗

248
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,849
好的
Yes

249
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:05,170
你是怎么知道我们孩子的事情的
How did you find out about our babies?

250
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,944
你是怎么知道的
How did you find out?

251
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,672
我从她眼中看出来的
I read it in her eyes.  

252
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,862
安妮
Anne,

253
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,100

00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:30,372
他们会把你吊在火刑柱上烧死 明白吗
can get you burnt at the stake, do you understand? 

257
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,852
最好不要再让我听到这种话
Best not to hear it anymore. 

258

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,794
我们晚上再说
We will talk tonight.

296
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,417
敬爱的主啊
Dear lord, 

297
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:56,116
愿您仁慈地看待他们的结合
may you look kindly upon the circumstances of their union.

298
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:58,798
怎么了
What is it?

299
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,450
你不舒服吗 伊丽莎白
Are you unwell, Elizabeth?

300
00:16:01,475 --> 00:16:04,353
我很好 很好 请继续
I am fine, fine. Please, please continue.

301
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:08,123
他们因为彼此相爱而结合
A union brought about by their great love for each other, 

302
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:09,614
为了证明这一点
as demonstrated 


303
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:13,255
托马斯·巴雷特宁愿牺牲自己的
by Thomas Barrett's willingness to forsake his own ...

304
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,587
嗨 嗨 嗨 怎么了
Hey, hey, hey. What is it?

305
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,447
我想我怀孕了
I think I am pregnant.

306
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,066
我要当父亲了
I am to be a father!!!

307
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,770
我要有孩子了
The boy’s still got it! 

308
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,490
我要有孩子了
This boy still got it. 

309
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,820
太棒了
Yes!

310
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,134
这位是威廉·斯塔宾斯 总督
This is William Stubbins, Governor.

311
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,187
你好
How do you do?

312
00:17:23,212 --> 00:17:24,627
你好 总督
How do you do, Governor?

313
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,590
他认为他可以帮我们
He thinks he can help us.

314
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:27,699
是吗
Yes?

315
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,470
我会一点锻造 总督
I know my way around the forge, Governor. 

316
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:33,219
我当过一年的学徒
I did one year as an apprentice. 

317
00:17:33,244 --> 00:17:35,438
我本来会继续干下去 但后来进了监狱
I would have done it all but I went to prison.

318
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:36,791
你会打造什么
Can you make anything?

319
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:37,845
钉子
Nails.

320
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,081
钉子吗
Nails.

321
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:40,136
是的 总督
Yes, Governor.

322
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:41,966
别的呢 锤子 或者
Nothing else? Hammers or...?

323
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:44,821
不能 总督 但是我会修理
No, Governor. But I can repair things. 

324
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,836
我会练习 练习 再练习
I will practise, practise, practise. 

325
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:47,860
再过上一两年
In a year or two 

326
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:49,826
我一定能做出任何你想要的东西
I will be able to make anything you need. 

327
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,310
在那之前 我会修好所有坏了的东西
Till then I will fix everything that gets broken.

328
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:56,092
很好 给自己招个学徒
Good. Find yourself an apprentice 

329
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,190
好好教他
and show him everything.

330
00:17:58,215 --> 00:17:59,606
是的 总督
Yes, Governor. 


331
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,325
我可以要求一点回报吗
May I ask for something in return?

332
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,062
可以
Yes

333
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,269
我有个妻子 在我的家乡
I have a wife back home.

334
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,332
对我来说 她意味着全世界
And she means the world to me. 

335
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,153
她写信说她会等着我
She has written here that she will wait for me. 

336
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,792
但是我要服刑十四年 总督
But I am doing fourteen years, Governor. 

337
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:26,114
我不能让她等我长达十四年
And I cannot ask her to wait for fourteen years.

338
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,162
努力工作 好好为我们服务
Work hard, serve us well 


339
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,279
四五年以后 你们就能团聚了
and you will be together in four or five.

340
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,060
你可以走了
You may go.

341
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:38,276
谢谢您
Thank you

342
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,781
我们有铁匠了
We have a blacksmith!!!

343
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,490
太好了 太好了
Yes!Yes!

344
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:04,831
恭喜你
Congratulations.

345
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:08,156
怎么了
What’s wrong?

346
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,708
不让我们干了
We have been told to stop.

347
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,340
谁不让了
By whom?

348
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,695
总督
The Governor.

349
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,523
但它已经起作用了
But it works. 

350
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,073
上帝听见了我们的声音
God hears us!

351
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:23,640
上尉
Captain.

352
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,423
我能为你做点什么吗 少校
Can I help you with something, Major?

353
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,740
凯瑟琳·麦克维蒂说她是无辜的
Katherine Mcvitie says she’s innocent.

354
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,538
是吗
Really?

355
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:45,415
她说当时她正在打理那位勋爵的卧室
She told me she was working in his lordship's bedroom 


356
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,640
勋爵走了进来 企图强暴她
when he entered and forced himself upon her.

357
00:19:47,976 --> 00:19:48,683
是吗
Yes?

358
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,358
她可能讲的是实情
She could be telling the truth?

359
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:52,167
恐怕这不是事实 少校 不是
I am afraid not, Major, no.


360
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,263
不是吗
No?

361
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,414
她是楼下的女仆 罗斯少校
She was the downstairs maid, Major Ross.

362
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:59,600
她根本不该靠近那位勋爵的卧室
She should not have been anywhere near his lordship's bedroom.

363
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:01,952
噢 我明白了
Ah. I see.

364
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:03,052
抱歉
I am sorry.

365
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,779
没必要道歉 她只是个妓女而已
There’s no need to apologise. She is only a whore..

366
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,683
晚安
Good night

367
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,786
晚安
Good night

368
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,452
你怎么知道那些的
How do you know that?

369
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:18,055
她档案里都写着呢
It is in her file.

370
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,870
你有上千个档案 你看过所有的内容吗
You have a thousand files. Would you know what is in them all?

371
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:21,551
没有
No

372
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:23,693
那你怎么知道凯瑟琳·麦克维蒂的事呢
Then why Katherine Mcvitie's?

373
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:25,578
因为她太漂亮了 罗斯少校
Because she is so beautiful, Major Ross.
 
374
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:28,903
而且我听说你跟她走得很近
And I heard you were getting ... rather close.

375
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,187
好吧 谢谢你
Ah, well, thank you.

376
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:45,283
谢谢你
Thank you

377
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,594
你想做什么
What do you want?

378
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:58,341
这可能是我的
It could be mine.

379
00:20:58,847 --> 00:20:59,599
你指什么
What could?

380
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:00,880
你的孩子
Your baby. 

381
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:03,702
你的孩子可能是我的
Your baby could be mine.

382
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:04,954
我可不信
I doubt it. 

383
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:08,840
他需要一个真正的父亲 而不是虚构的
It needs a man, not a shirt button.

384
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,209
我该告诉他吗
Should I tell him?

385
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:12,189
告诉汤米吗
Tommy?

386
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:13,082
是的
Yeah

387
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:17,302
那可不是一个好主意
That would not be a good idea.

388
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:18,687
我该保密吗
I should stay silent?

389
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:19,840
是的
Yes

390
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,217
回报呢
And in return?

391
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,154
你有什么建议吗
What do you suggest?

392
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,488
我想再
I want you. 

393
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,024
要你一次
Again. 


394
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,553
这里的男人是女人的五倍多
Five men to every woman:

395
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:36,655
为了得到女人 男人就得不择手段
a man must do whatever it takes.

396
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,180
你很享受这个 是吗
And you would enjoy that, would you?

397
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:39,391
是的
Yes

398
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:43,575
享受和一个鄙视你的女人做爱吗
Shagging a woman who you know despises you. 

399
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,527
没错
Yes

400
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:46,782
你会从中得到快乐吗
You would get pleasure from such a thing?

401
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,344
反正这里所有人都瞧不起我
It seems there is no one here that does not despise me.

402
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,618
所以 没错 我就是能从中得到快乐
So yes, I would get pleasure from it.

403
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,746
那么 我们去找汤米谈谈
Let us talk to Tommy then.

404
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,205
什么
what?

405
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,553
你可以把一切都告诉汤米
You can tell all this to Tommy.

406
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,895
你在开玩笑
You are joking.

407
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:13,788
我没有
I am not.

408
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:14,697
你在吓唬我
You are bluffing. 

409
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:15,774
我没有
I am not.

410
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,687
他会杀了你
He would kill you.

411
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,110
有可能
He might. 

412
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,969
但他绝对会杀了你
He would definitely kill you.

413
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,902
巴克利列兵
Private Buckley!

414
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:49,127
是的 长官
Yes sir.

415
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,673
你没有行礼
You did not salute.

416
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,762
对不起 长官
I am sorry, Sir.

417
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,966
有什么问题吗
What is wrong?

418
00:22:58,462 --> 00:22:59,935
没有 长官
Nothing, Sir.

419
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,837
把凯瑟琳·麦克维蒂给我带过来
Bring Katherine Mcvitie to me.

420
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:05,027
遵命 长官
Yes, Sir.

421
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,295
如果她不从 就拽过来
Drag her if you must.

422
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,520
遵命 长官
Sir.

423
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:10,255
我们可以一起逃走
We could run away together.

424
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,696
去哪
To where?

425
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:13,006
去丛林里
The Bush.

426
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,670
我们会死在那的
We would die there. 

427
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:16,085
杰弗森就没死
Jefferson did not die.

428
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,005
你怎么知道
How do you know?

429
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,925
他没有回来
He has not returned.

430
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,811
杰弗森没回来
Jefferson did not return 

431
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:20,260
是因为他已经死在丛林了
because he died in the Bush.

432
00:23:20,285 --> 00:23:22,315
或者 他没回来是因为他做对了
Or he has not returned because he was right:


433
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,610
你能在丛林里活下来
you can live in the Bush.

434
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:24,891
凯瑟琳·麦克维蒂 请吧
Katherine Mcvitie please!

435
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,111
我们现在就可以走
We could go now. 

436
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:26,766
趁天黑吗
In darkness?

437
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:27,481
是的
Yes

438
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,615
我看到只老鼠都会尖叫 看到蟑螂也会
I scream at the sight of a mere mouse. A cockroach even. 

439
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,428
我怎么能够在丛林里适应这些呢
How would I cope with the things that live in the Bush?

440
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,289
我会照顾你的 我发誓我会
I will look after you, I promise I will ...

441
00:23:33,314 --> 00:23:34,891
凯瑟琳·麦克维蒂 该跟我走了
Katherine Mcvitie, you are to come with me 

442
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:35,772
我们在讲话
We are talking!

443
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:37,076
我奉命立刻护送你
... right now, please. Because I have orders to escort you 

444
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:38,249
到罗斯少校那里去
to Major Ross immediately

445
00:23:38,274 --> 00:23:39,289
我们在讲话
We are talking!

446
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:40,588
如果你现在不跟我走
so if you do not come with me right now 

447
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:41,779
我就会把你拽去他那
I will drag you to him

448
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:42,730
我们在讲话 伙计
We are talking, man!

449
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:43,688
我的命令中包括
Because my orders include 

450
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,066
在不得已的时候有权使用武力
The right to use force if I have to!!

451
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,098
巴克利列兵
Private Buckley!

452
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,415
他被迫和别人分享他的女人
He has to share his woman. 


453
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,110
但至少他还有个女人
But at least he has one to share.  

454
00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:54,925
你不能 永远不能 罗斯少校的皮条客
You do not.You never will, Major Ross' pimp, 


455
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,860
因为你是个非常丑陋的人
because you are a very ugly man. 

456
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,284
你是什么
What are you?

457
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:00,829
一个非常丑陋的人 中士
A very ugly man, Sarge.

458
00:24:00,854 --> 00:24:02,135
从内到外
Inside and out. 

459
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,547
现在就回到罗斯少校那去
Now go back to Major Ross 


460
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:05,088
然后告诉他凯瑟琳·麦克维蒂
and tell him that Katherine Mcvitie 

461
00:24:05,113 --> 00:24:06,550
会在半小时内过去
will be with him in half an hour. 


462
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:09,622
告诉他 是蒂明斯中士保证的
Tell him that Sergeant Timmins has given his word on that.

463
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,740
遵命 中士
Sarge.

464
00:24:10,923 --> 00:24:11,783
快去
Go

465
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,718
遵命
Sarge.

466
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,347
半小时
Half an hour.

467
00:24:22,372 --> 00:24:23,106
是的 长官
Sir

468
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,231
脱下你的肩章
Take off your stripes! 


469
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,968
解开你的腰带
Take off your sash.

470
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,769
我受够了被当作狗屎一样对待
I am sick of being treated like shit! 

471
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,311
解开你的腰带和我打一架 一对一
Take off your sash and fight me man to man.

472
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,879
不
No

473
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,111
脱下你的腰带和我打一架 你这个懦夫
Take off your sash and fight me, you bloody coward.

474
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,849
好吧
Right.

475
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,588
开始吧
Proceed.

476
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,392
够了吗
Enough?

477
00:26:36,465 --> 00:26:38,366
还是我 巴克利列兵 长官
Private Buckley again, Sir.

478
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:41,350
长官 蒂明斯中士说凯瑟琳·麦克维蒂
Sir. Sergeant Timmins says Katherine Mcvitie 

479
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,925
会在半小时内过来 长官 他做了保证
will be here in half an hour, Sir, he gives his word on that.

480
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,358
你的脸怎么了
What happened to your face?

481
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:46,928
我摔倒了 长官
I fell over, Sir.

482
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,441
我可以走了吗 长官
May I go, Sir?

483
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,696
你哭了吗
Are you crying?

484
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,237
没有 长官
No, Sir. 

485
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,925
眼泪 长官 是的 长官 但是
Tears, Sir, yes but ... 

486
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,130
是因为愤怒 长官 不是哭泣 长官
tears of anger, Sir. Not crying,Sir

487
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,079
为什么愤怒
Why are you angry?

488
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,099
因为我摔倒了 长官
Because I fell over, Sir.

489
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,898
你可以走了
You may go.

490
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,282
遵命 长官
Sir

491
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,133
教我拳击吧
Teach me to box.

492
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,383
为什么
Why?

493
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,081
很多原因 最主要的是可以保护我自己
Lots of reasons. The main reason being to defend myself. 

494
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,322
他们都看到你羞辱了我
They all saw you humiliate me. 


495
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,626
他们不会归因于你太强
They will not put that down to you being good . 

496
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:04,975
而是觉得我太差了
but to me being bad

497
00:28:05,902 --> 00:28:07,298
他们会觉得我没什么好怕的
They’ll think they have nothing to fear from me 

498
00:28:07,323 --> 00:28:08,773
然后因此而攻击我
and they’ll attack.

499
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:11,157
你应该在你挑战我之前就想到这个
You should have thought of that before you challenged me.

500
00:28:11,182 --> 00:28:12,932
我不得不挑战你
I had to challenge you. 

501
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:15,839
一个人承受耻辱是有限度的
There is only so much contempt a man can take.

502
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,371
如果人们瞧不起你
If people have contempt for you, 

503
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,231
那一定是有原因的
there must be a reason.

504
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,979
不
No. 

505
00:28:40,912 --> 00:28:43,412
我只是不能灵活地应对其他人
I duck and dive no more than any man. 

506
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,423
我也和他们一样小心翼翼
I sniff around no more than any man. 

507
00:28:47,063 --> 00:28:50,288
我不比任何人差
I am no worse than any man here. 

508
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,191
但是当人们处在这样一个地方
But when people are in a place like this, 


509
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,438
他们需要有个人成为泄愤工具
they need someone to shit upon. 

510
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,751
你想在这里找到什么
What did you expect to find here?

511
00:29:01,064 --> 00:29:02,565
土著女人
Native women; 

512
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,220
全裸的
all naked, 

513
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,711
每个人的胸部都很大
all carrying armfuls of fruit, 

514
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,098
都想和我做爱
all wanting to fuck me.

515
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,399
教我拳击吧
Teach me to box.

516
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,890
还有别的吗
Anything else?

517
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,658
有
Yes. 

518
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,276
“我希望
"I hope”

519
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:40,350
“我希望"
"I hope”

520
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,675
“能亲手写我的下一封信”
“To be able to write my next letter myself."

521
00:29:45,272 --> 00:29:48,235
柯林斯上尉在教我读书和写字
Captain Collins is teaching me to read and write.

522
00:29:51,193 --> 00:29:52,968
每天大约就半小时左右
Only half an hour or so each day 

523
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:55,652
所以可能要花很长时间才能学成 但是
so it will take a long time, but, 

524
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:58,148
到时候即使我不需要你了
and even when I no longer need you, 


525
00:29:58,173 --> 00:29:59,550
其他人还是需要的
others will. 

526
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,415
成百上千人还会继续需要你的帮忙
Hundreds will go on needing you.

527
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,523
对不起
I am sorry. .

528
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,984
如果这么说伤害到你了 我很抱歉
I am sorry if I have hurt you

529
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:17,896
“我希望
Er ... I hope ... 

530
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:24,144
“能够”
to be able ...

531
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,960
我能帮忙吗
May I help?

532
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,204
伊丽莎白·奎恩
Elizabeth Quinn - 

533
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:48,687
伊丽莎白·巴伦特怀孕了
Elizabeth Barrett is pregnant.


534
00:30:51,656 --> 00:30:53,636
在英格兰 这可不是什么好消息
In England that would not be good news. 

535
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:55,871
会是一桩丑闻
It would be a scandal..


536
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,500
为什么在这里不是呢
Why is it not a scandal here? 

537
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,072
嗯
Hmm

538
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,909
因为 他们在这里结婚了
Well they are married here. 

539
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,739
他们离家一万英里远呢
And they are ten thousand miles from home.

540
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,879
假设离家只有十英里 这会是丑闻吗
Yeah, if it were ten miles from home, would it be a scandal?

541
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,975
当然会
Of course.

542
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,587
那一百英里呢 一千英里呢
A hundred miles? A thousand miles? 

543
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,788
多远才够我们改变道德标准呢
How far must we be for rules to change?

544
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,013
我一个人能处理得了 谢谢你
I think I can manage now, thank you.

545
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,005
我只是说说而已
I am only thinking aloud.


546
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,830
嗯 我知道
Yes, I realise that.

547
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:44,766
进来
Come in.

548
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:48,935
你想见 哦 你好 黛博拉
You wish to se - oh Hello, Deborah.

549
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,314
你好 教士
Hello Reverend.

550
00:31:51,064 --> 00:31:52,214
你想见我吗
You wish to see me?

551
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:54,695
是的 是的 关于教堂的事
Yes, yes. It’s about the church.

552
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,230
我知道你想说什么
I know what you are about to say.

553
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:57,050
哦 是吗
You do?

554
00:31:57,075 --> 00:31:58,923
是的 你想问“起好名字了吗”
Yes. Have I thought of a name? 

555
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:00,239
答案是肯定的
And the answer is yes: 

556
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,236
我们准备以你的名字来命名
we want to name it after you.

557
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:03,817
我并不是想说这个
That is not what I was about to say. 

558
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:05,945
虽然我喜欢你的回答 没错 但是
It is very good of you, yes, but, 

559
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,480
我希望你事先可以跟我讲一下
I wish you’d spoken to me about it first.

560
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:11,428
这是宗教的事
It is a spiritual matter. 

561
00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:14,575
我不需要跟你商量宗教方面的事 总督
I need not discuss spiritual matters, Governor

562
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,035
一起喝点朗姆酒吧
Will you join me in a tot of rum?

563
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,891
你有朗姆酒吗
You have rum?

564
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:17,567
是的
Yes

565
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:18,191
哦
Oh?

566
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:20,498
好的 我戒了一个月
Yes, I abstain for a month 

567
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,830
现在可以放纵一个月了
so I can spoil myself the following month. 

568
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:24,337
可以帮忙倒酒吗 黛博拉
Would you, Deborah?

569
00:32:24,362 --> 00:32:25,502
当然
Of course.

570
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:27,419
要是喝酒不觉得是享受
Better not to drink at all 

571
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:29,039
那还不如一点都不喝
than to drink and feel no benefit. 

572
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:30,541
教士
Reverend, 

573
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:32,231
我知道这很难
this is difficult 

574
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,885
因为我知道这座教堂对你有多重要
because I know how much the church means to you.
 
575
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,550
但我觉得 不应该让罪犯来建它
But I do not think the convicts should be building it.


576
00:32:39,575 --> 00:32:40,610
为什么呢
Why is that?

577
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:41,671
啊 谢谢
Ah thank you.  

578
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:45,108
他们半饥不饱的 也不够强壮
They are half starved. They are not strong enough.

579
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,873
有人喝了我的酒
Someone has been at this.

580
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,301
是的
Yes

581
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:52,676
你知道是谁吗
Do you know who?

582
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,636
是我
Me

583
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,377
你吗
You?

584
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,213
是的
Yes

585
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:01,008
你又不喝酒
You do not drink.

586
00:33:01,786 --> 00:33:03,248
我想试试
I thought I would try it.

587
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,167
为什么
Why?

588
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:08,783
我感到很紧张 很焦虑
I was feeling nervous and tense and I, 

589
00:33:08,808 --> 00:33:10,358
所以我想
I thought ... 

590
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:11,983
我去把它换掉
I will replace it.

591
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:14,039
不不不 不用了 这样挺好
No, no, no, no, no. It is fine. 

592
00:33:14,064 --> 00:33:15,145
来两个小杯
Two small ones then.

593
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,815
不用给我倒 你自己留着喝吧
No save it for yourself.

594
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,708
不 就两小杯
No. Two, two small ones. 

595
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:20,695
我刚刚说到哪了
Now where was I?

596
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,859
你说那些人不够强壮
You were saying that the men were not strong enough.

597
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,210
没错
Yes. 

598
00:33:24,591 --> 00:33:28,101
吃多少东西得干多少活
What you take in must equal what you put out. 

599
00:33:28,126 --> 00:33:30,916
要是吃多了 你就会长胖
If it is more, you go fat. 


600
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:33,720
吃少了 就会饿死
If it is less, you die.

601
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,140
除了有肢体力量
There is physical strength 

602
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:43,630
还有精神力量
and there is spiritual strength. 

603
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,685
按这样说 男人们在建教堂的时候
In this case the men are building a church 

604
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,446
他们的精神力量会支撑他们
so their spiritual strength will sustain them.


605
00:33:50,536 --> 00:33:53,461
只有单纯的体力 教士
There is just strength, Reverend.

606
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,154
晚安
Good night.

607
00:33:57,184 --> 00:33:58,394
你要走了吗
Are you going?

608
00:33:58,648 --> 00:33:59,638
是的
Yes

609
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:00,732
这么早吗
So early?

610
00:34:01,076 --> 00:34:02,050
是的
Yes. 

611
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,271
晚安 教士
Good night, Reverend.

612
00:34:03,296 --> 00:34:04,451
晚安 黛博拉
Good night, Deborah.

613
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,433
你不舒服吗
Are you not well?

614
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,827
没有 我很好 晚安
No, I am fine. Good night.

615
00:34:11,288 --> 00:34:13,535
对不起 我们说到哪了
I am sorry: Where was I again?

616
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,182
“只有单纯的体力”
"There is just strength".

617
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:18,814
是的 是的 他们所拥有的力量
Yes, yes. And what strength they have 


618
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,901
要用来开辟土地
is needed for clearing the land,building 

619
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:24,251
以及建造一些我们赖以生存的建筑
- things on which their very survival hangs 

620
00:34:24,276 --> 00:34:27,353
所以很抱歉 我不能让他们干别的
and I am sorry I cannot allow them to do anything else.

621
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,750
我和我妻子会自己解决的
Then my wife and I will do it ourselves.

622
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:33,285
两个人根本不够
That is beyond any couple.

623
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,190
我要让你看看什么是精神力量
I would like to show you what spiritual strength 

624
00:34:36,215 --> 00:34:37,935
所能做到的 总督
can achieve, Governor. 


625
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,510
我不会跟他说话的
I will not speak to him.

626
00:34:55,535 --> 00:34:58,611
上次他非要我说话 但这次我不会了
 He made me speak last time but this time I will not.


627
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,435
他可以得到我的身体 的确
 He can have my body, yes: 

628
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:01,798
我没办法反抗
there is nothing I can do about that. 


629
00:35:01,823 --> 00:35:03,986
但是他永远也得不到我的灵魂
But he will not have my mind. 

630
00:35:05,943 --> 00:35:07,535
也得不到我的心
Or my heart.

631
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,377
我会从这里走过去
I will go on from here.

632
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,011
凯瑟琳·麦克维蒂找您 长官
Katherine Mcvitie for you, Sir.

633
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,510
他确实是个勇敢的男人
He is ten times the man that ... 

634
00:35:28,535 --> 00:35:30,673
但更多的时候是个士兵
... he is. And twenty times the soldier.

635
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,175
你说勋爵走进了房间
His Lordship walked into the room, you said, 


636
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:19,547
然后把你按在床上
threw you onto the bed 

637
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:21,142
要不是他妻子恰好在场
and would have raped you 

638
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:22,713
他差点就强暴了你
but for his wife happening on the scene.

639
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,227
我问了柯林斯上尉
I put that to Captain Collins 


640
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,980
因为他有你所有的档案
because he has files on you all and erm, 

641
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:32,638
他说你在撒谎
he said it is lies. 

642
00:36:32,663 --> 00:36:34,916
你是楼下的女仆
You were the downstairs maid. 


643
00:36:35,223 --> 00:36:37,691
去楼上干什么呢
What were you doing upstairs?

644
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,961
是去勾引他吧
You enticed him. 

645
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,728
你准备等他睡着了 就去偷他的钱夹
You planned to wait until he slept and walk off with his wallet.

646
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,805
对此你有什么想说的吗
What have you to say to that?

647
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,082
不说话吗
Not talking?

648
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,102
是不是因为你没法为自己辩解
 Now is that because you have no defence, 

649
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:12,926
也没有理由开脱了吧
nothing to offer in mitigation? 

650
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:16,194
或者说这是你的某种策略呢
Or is, is it a tactic of some sort? 

651
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,913
嗯
Hmm?

652
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,720
我是个士兵
I am a soldier. 

653
00:37:23,592 --> 00:37:26,953
我喜欢一丝不挂又话少的女人
Naked and dumb is exactly how I like my women 


654
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,648
如果你想要故意引我不高兴
so if this is meant to disconcert me, 

655
00:37:28,673 --> 00:37:30,581
我向你保证 不会的
I can assure you it does not. 

656
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,146
所以
So,

657
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:35,968
告诉我
please: Tell. Me. 

658
00:37:35,993 --> 00:37:40,025
为什么你不说话
Why. You are not. Speaking.

659
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,300
今晩想吃什么
What food would you like tonight? 

660
00:37:49,897 --> 00:37:52,175
我有些风干的豌豆
I er, have some dried peas. 

661
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,731
想来一点吗
Would you like some?

662
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,420
他不爱你
He does not love you. 

663
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,510
他对你有欲望 没错
He might lust after you, yes, 

664
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:11,495
但那仅仅是生理需求
but that is all: lust.

665
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:15,167
把你分享出去他是不会受伤的
Sharing you cannot possibly hurt him 

666
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,775
因为你就是个妓女
for you are a whore 

667
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,962
男人们总是一起分享妓女
and men always share a whore.

668
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,406
这样做太蠢了 凯瑟琳
This is rather silly, Katherine, 


669
00:38:24,942 --> 00:38:27,112
因为我知道你有多想赶快结束这一切
because I know how much you like to get it over with 

670
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:28,259
然后回到他身边
and get back to him and, 

671
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:31,085
但很遗憾 你不说话我是不会开始的
sadly, I will not start until you have spoken.

672
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,712
我们可以这样待到明天早上
We could be here till morning.

673
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:53,204
你想让我说什么
What would you like me to say?

674
00:38:58,596 --> 00:39:00,686
一些实话
Something truthful.

675
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,140
你觉得我讨厌你
You think I hate you 

676
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,696
你是对的
and you are right. 

677
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:23,576
我确实讨厌你
I do. 

678
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,452
但你认为我只是鄙视你
But you think I have nothing but contempt for you 


679
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,686
那你就错了
and you are wrong. 

680
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,945
因为偶尔
Because occasionally, .

681
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,710
也只是偶尔
just occasionally, 

682
00:39:41,843 --> 00:39:43,897
我会同情你
I feel sorry for you

683
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,360
我想我要开始了
I think I will begin now.

684
00:39:57,385 --> 00:39:58,312
你是真的在问
Are you seriously asking 

685
00:39:58,337 --> 00:40:00,113
为什么一个人要学会读书写字吧
why a man should be able to read and write?

686
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:01,648
是 是的
Yes, yes.

687
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,483
你给伊丽莎白写了封信 对吧
You left a letter for Elizabeth - am I right?

688
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:05,454
一封信吗
A letter?

689
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:06,314
开玩笑
Clown!

690
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:07,895
那时我以为他们要绞死我了
When I thought they were hanging me, yeah. Thanks for that.

691
00:40:07,896 --> 00:40:09,140
是的 谢谢你做的那些
Thanks for that.

692
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:11,654
你肯定是让莱特斯·莫洛伊帮你写的
But you had to get Letters Molloy to write it for you.

693
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,040
写了什么
What did it say?

694
00:40:13,065 --> 00:40:14,056
没什么
Nothing.

695
00:40:14,485 --> 00:40:16,676
你要把那张王拿起来吗
Are you, are you picking that king up?

696
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:19,163
如此珍贵的一封信
Is it right 

697
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:21,418
让别人知道了内容 这样好吗
for another man to know the contents of such a precious letter?

698
00:40:21,443 --> 00:40:22,407
莱特斯·莫洛伊
Letters Molloy 

699
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:24,094
是我们当中最值得信任的人
is one of the most trustworthy men amongst us.

700
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,107
不过
Nevertheless ...

701
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:26,426
这张王 你是要还是不要
Are you picking that king up not?

702
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:27,576
我故意的
I am deliberating.

703
00:40:27,957 --> 00:40:29,111
你写了什么
What did it say?

704
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:31,126
我写的是“等我死了再看”
It said, "To be read in the event of my death" and, 

705
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:33,443
但如你所见 我还活着
as you can see I am still alive.

706
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:36,355
你有那张该死的王吗
Are you having that bloody king?

707
00:40:36,356 --> 00:40:37,355
是的 我有
Yes I am!! 


708
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,190
因为我知道你想要它
Because I know you wanted it.

709
00:40:42,597 --> 00:40:44,667
太感谢了
Thank you very much. 

710
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,522
我赢了
I am out.

711
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:49,392
快看呀
Look at that.

712
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:55,226
莱特斯·莫洛伊先生要见你 长官
It’s Letters Molloy, Sir.

713
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,312
进来
Come in.

714
00:40:59,484 --> 00:41:01,021
我读完了
I have finished it.

715
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,934
啊 你喜欢吗
Oh? Did you enjoy it?

716
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:04,394
是的 很喜欢
Yes. Very much.

717
00:41:04,616 --> 00:41:05,872
你要再拿一本吗
Would you like another?

718
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,635
如果不是很麻烦的话
If it is not too much trouble.

719
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,162
不 一点也不麻烦
No, not at all.

720
00:41:10,973 --> 00:41:12,243
呃
Er ... 

721
00:41:13,926 --> 00:41:17,988
1762年度世界大事年鉴
The Annual Register of 1762.

722
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:22,003
啊 好 谢谢
Oh? Yes? Thank you.

723
00:41:24,924 --> 00:41:26,272
还有事吗
Is there something else?

724
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,407
你在教斯塔宾识字
You are teaching Stubbins to read?

725
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,773
是的 斯塔宾和其他一些人
Stubbins and a few others, yes.

726
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:36,129
没必要
Well there’s, there’s no need. 

727
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,810
我很乐意帮他们写信 是的
I am more than happy to go on doing it for them. Yes -

728
00:41:38,835 --> 00:41:41,918
他们很感激你为他们所做的一切
They are very grateful for all that you do, 

729
00:41:41,943 --> 00:41:42,754
莱特斯
Letters,  

730
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:45,565
但他们迟早要自己做这些事
but they would sooner do it for themselves.

731
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:47,416
怎么了
What is wrong?

732
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:48,563
柯林斯上尉
Captain Collins, 

733
00:41:48,588 --> 00:41:51,090
如果斯塔宾学会了读信 他会自杀的
if Stubbins learns to read, he will kill himself.

734
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:54,240
为什么会那样呢
How can that be?

735
00:41:54,265 --> 00:41:56,555
他不是一直随身带着他妻子的一封信吗
He carries around a letter from his wife. Yes?

736
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,513
是的
Yes

737
00:41:58,237 --> 00:41:59,272
你看过那封信吗
Have you ever read it?

738
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:00,073
没有
No

739
00:42:00,098 --> 00:42:02,485
他收到这封信时在泰晤士河上的监狱船里
He got it on the prison ship in the Thames. 

740
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,118
就在我们出发前两天
Two days before we sailed. 

741
00:42:04,143 --> 00:42:06,037
他让我念给他听
He asked me to read it to him. 

742
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:09,135
在她写着
Where she had written, 

743
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,772
“我遇到了另一个男人”
"I have met another man," 

744
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,645
我却念成了
I read, 

745
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,152
“我将永远对你忠贞不渝 亲爱的”
"I will always be true to you, my darling."

746
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,940
什么
What!

747
00:42:19,148 --> 00:42:21,498
他要去世界的另一边去了 你知道的
He was sailing to the other side of the world,

748
00:42:21,523 --> 00:42:23,773
而且几乎可以肯定永远也见不到她了
 you see and almost certain never to see her again. 

749
00:42:23,798 --> 00:42:26,283
所以 为什么要打破他的美梦呢
So why crush him? 

750
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,558
你知道我的困境了吧
You see my dilemma.

751
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,973
恐怕你现在也让我为难了
I'm afraid you have now made it mine as well.

752
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,935
对不起
I am sorry. 

753
00:42:40,144 --> 00:42:42,144
我会拥有一个跟你一样美丽的女人
I would have a woman just as beautiful as you, 

754
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:44,169
但是比你贞洁
but decent too. 


755
00:42:45,538 --> 00:42:48,358
受过良好教育 有教养
Educated. Refined. 

756
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,536
这是在这个地方 才让我们在一起
It is only this place that has brought us together 


757
00:42:51,561 --> 00:42:53,567
但是 你却这样对我
and yet you treat me like this.

758
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,021
我可以走了吗 求你了
May I go please 

759
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:02,859
不行


760
00:43:03,835 --> 00:43:07,145
不 以后每周我都要你来三个晚上
No. No, I will have you three nights a week in future.

761
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:11,803
我会跟麦克唐纳下士进行必要的协商
I will make the necessary arrangements with Corporal Macdonald. 

762
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,313
你的豌豆在那里
Your peas are there.

763
00:43:17,275 --> 00:43:18,889
你不想要了吗
You do not want them?

764
00:43:20,977 --> 00:43:22,190
你可以走了
You may go.

765
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:40,409
打扫房间的女仆那天请假了
The chambermaid was off that day. 

766
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:43,568
她去堕胎了
She was getting an abortion, 

767
00:43:44,026 --> 00:43:46,482
勋爵帮她安排的
arranged by his Lordship. 

768
00:43:47,874 --> 00:43:49,672
我当时在替她的班
I was doing her job. 

769
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:52,668
再见
Goodbye.


770
00:44:15,145 --> 00:44:17,479
他让我以后每周过去三个晚上
He wants me three nights a week.

771
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,629
那你说了什么
And what did you say?

772
00:44:32,729 --> 00:44:34,599
我能说什么
What could I say?

773
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,628
凯瑟琳
Katherine!

774
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,884
凯瑟琳
Katherine!

775
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,910
凯瑟琳
Katherine!

776
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,246
凯瑟琳
Katherine!

777
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,173
凯瑟琳
Katherine!

778
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,296
凯瑟琳
Katherine!

779
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,834
没事了
It’s alright, 

780
00:46:43,022 --> 00:46:44,067
别怕
come on.

781
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,179
麦克唐纳下士
Corporal Macdonald. 

782
00:46:56,562 --> 00:46:57,344
长官
Sir. 

783
00:46:57,369 --> 00:46:58,426
她是游过来的吗
She swam to here?

784
00:46:58,451 --> 00:46:59,229
是的 长官
Yes, Sir.

785
00:46:59,254 --> 00:47:00,575
离岸100码吗
A hundred yards from shore?

786
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,422
是的 长官
Yes, Sir.

787
00:47:01,447 --> 00:47:02,602
在晚上吗
In the dark.

788
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,030
是的 长官
Yes, Sir.

789
00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:05,544
她想投海自尽
She was trying to drown herself.

790
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:06,864
不是的 长官
No, Sir.

791
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,347
她怎么敢
How dare she!

792
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,650
她怎么敢这么做
How dare she!

793
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,610
对不起
I am sorry. .

794
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,131
他们马上就会把尸体运过来
They are bringing in his body

795
00:47:54,631 --> 00:47:55,663
你是怎么知道的
How do you know?

796
00:47:55,688 --> 00:47:57,827
我昨晚游过去的时候撞上了他
I swam into it last night.

797
00:47:58,736 --> 00:48:00,167
游到那么远吗
So far out?

798
00:48:01,577 --> 00:48:03,646
我当时想自杀
I was trying to kill myself.

799
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:09,184
是的 但很不幸 我没成功
Yes. But sadly I did not succeed. 

800
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:12,735
我看到了马斯顿 他的样子很恐怖
I saw Marston and he looked horrible 

801
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,092
我不想变成跟他一样可怕
and I did not want to look like that.


802
00:48:17,448 --> 00:48:19,655
他活着的时候看起来也一样可怕
He looked like that alive.

803
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:22,968
真的很对不起
I am so sorry.

804
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,554
詹姆斯
James! 

805
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,630
听着 你要么拼死反抗 要么就逃走
Listen, you stay and fight your corner or you run. 

806
00:48:30,655 --> 00:48:32,121
如果他选择逃走 就需要淡水
If it is "run" he will need fresh water.

807
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:33,111
我去拿一些
I will get some.

808
00:48:33,136 --> 00:48:34,220
他差点把你饿死了
He was starving you to death 

809
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,198
他们却没给你任何帮助
and they did not lift a finger to help you 

810
00:48:36,223 --> 00:48:37,143
你还能怎样呢
so what else could you do?

811
00:48:37,168 --> 00:48:38,153
这么说没用 汤米
It will not work, Tommy. 

812
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:39,406
他已经向所有人宣布了
He has announced to everyone 

813
00:48:39,431 --> 00:48:41,350
一旦找到了尸体 他就会绞死我
he will hang me once the body is found 

814
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,050
他不会食言的 我完了
and he will not go back on that. I am finished. 

815
00:48:43,076 --> 00:48:44,612
所以我必须逃走
So I must run.


816
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:45,519
快跑
Go

817
00:48:45,544 --> 00:48:46,380
去哪里呢
To where? 

818
00:48:46,405 --> 00:48:47,241
丛林
The bush.

819
00:48:47,266 --> 00:48:48,455
你在丛林里是无法生存的
You will not survive in the bush.

820
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,355
我去找杰弗森
I will find Jefferson.

821
00:48:49,356 --> 00:48:50,231
杰弗森已经死了
Jefferson is dead.

822
00:48:50,256 --> 00:48:51,569
哦 是吗 那我去找土著
Yeah, well I will find the natives, 


823
00:48:51,594 --> 00:48:52,723
求得他们的怜悯
I throw myself upon their mercy.

824
00:48:52,748 --> 00:48:53,867
他们不会帮你的
They will not help you.

825
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:54,659
我知道
I know. 

826
00:48:54,684 --> 00:48:56,597
但浪费一顿美餐是可耻的
But it is a shame to waste a good meal. 

827
00:48:56,622 --> 00:48:58,185
但愿能再见
Till we meet again.

828
00:49:02,871 --> 00:49:05,570
我在那个地狱般的船舱里被关了六个月
I was cooped up in that hell-hole of a ship for six months, 

829
00:49:05,595 --> 00:49:07,260
然后被扔到这个地方受苦 挨饿
tossed up here to burn and starve, work 

830
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:08,122
拼死干活
until I drop. 

831
00:49:08,147 --> 00:49:09,489
但是你知道吗 伊丽莎白
And do you know what, Elizabeth? 

832
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:11,113
我愿意把这个过程再经历一遍
I would do it all again 

833
00:49:11,138 --> 00:49:12,086
因为这样
because by doing it 

834
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,153
我会遇到你
I met you.

835
00:49:27,985 --> 00:49:29,071
弗里曼在哪里
Where’s Freeman?

836
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,230
快把那个人铐住
Chain that man!

837
00:49:31,255 --> 00:49:32,217
快点
Go! 

838
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,155
向他开枪
Shoot that man.

839
00:49:34,156 --> 00:49:35,151
快点
Go

840
00:49:35,176 --> 00:49:36,111
趴下
Down!

841
00:49:36,136 --> 00:49:37,125
开火
Fire!

842
00:49:38,422 --> 00:49:39,335
开火
Fire!

843
00:49:39,696 --> 00:49:40,791
抓住他
After him!

844
00:49:40,816 --> 00:49:43,185
快点 跑步前进
Come on!  On the double!

845
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,265
要是看到他 就开火
D’you see him?  Fire at will.

846
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,543
大家尽量待在一起
Stick together.

847
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,500
你们两个 搜下面
You two, search down there! 

848
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:26,037
是 长官
Yes sir

849
00:50:26,505 --> 00:50:28,004
全能的上帝
Amighty God

850
00:50:29,576 --> 00:50:30,753
哦 不
Oh No

851
00:50:39,562 --> 00:50:41,006
抓住他
Take him!
