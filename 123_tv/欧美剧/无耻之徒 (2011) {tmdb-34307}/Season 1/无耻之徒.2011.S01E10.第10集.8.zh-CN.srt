不给他们掖被子

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,698
她说不定都忘了给利亚姆涂屁屁霜呢
She probably forgot to use Liam's ass cream, too.

70
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:35,966
就是这样的

她都没给他们准备午餐

也从来没给孩子们寄过哪怕一张生日卡

131
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,149
她刚走那会儿一定很难熬吧

00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:16,593
是啊
Oh, right.

137
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:17,761
我连饭都吃不饱
I can't keep food on the table,

138
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,529
还要请个律师
but I'm hiring a lawyer.

139
00:06:19,563 --> 00:06:21,598
去搞清楚莫妮卡有什么权利
Just to find out what Monica can and can't do.

140
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,267
好了 我得去工作了
Here, you know what? I gotta get to work.

141
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:25,902
- 接着 - 什...

142
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:28,705
- 这是什么 - 你的新手机
- What's this? - Your own cell phone.

143
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:30,774
我跟你说过我不要你给我买东西
I told you I don't want you buying me stuff.

144
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:33,176
但情侣们都这样啊
It's what couples do.

145
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,177
给我们买张沙发吧
Get us a couch.

146
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:42,185
好了
Okay. Um...

Everyone...

149
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:53,596
等你们放学回来的时候我们不会在家
We won't be here when you get home from school.

150
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:54,964
- 为什么 - 怎么了
- Why? - What?

151
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,767
菲奥娜总是告诉我们原因的
Fiona always tells us why.

152
00:06:57,802 --> 00:06:59,869
- 关你们什么屁事 - 鲍比
- None of your damn business why. - Bob!

153
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:02,238
你妈妈让你们去上学 所以赶紧去吧
Your mother told you to go, so go!

154
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:04,374
- 走吧 - 你们先走 我随后就到
- Out. - Go on, guys. I'll catch up.

155
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,211
拜拜
Bye. Bye.

156
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:17,120
我他妈才不管DNA测试结果是什么
I don't care what the fucking DNA test says.

157
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:19,322
你们不能带走利亚姆
You're not taking Liam.

158
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:21,624
我们走着瞧
We'll see about that.

159
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:22,692
啊 走着瞧
Yeah, we will.

160
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:24,761
你有问题吗
Are we having a problem,

161
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:27,464
菲利普
Phillip?!

162
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:28,732
我不知道啊 鲍比
I dunno... Bob!

163
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,967
咱说说 你跑到我家来安营扎寨
Let's see. You're camped out in my house,

164
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:32,302
你上我妈妈
you're fucking my mother,

165
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:34,270
现在你还在盘算着怎么偷走我小弟
and you're talking about stealing my baby brother.

166
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:35,505
你说我们有没有问题
Why would we have a problem?

167
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,240
- 小子 小心我揍你 - 停下 别说了
- Boy, I will kick your... - Stop it! Hey!

168
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:39,242
恭喜你啊 老妈
And congratulations, Mom.

169
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:40,977
你择偶的眼光还是一如既往的不错
You always knew how to pick 'em.

170
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:41,978
利普
Lip!

171
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:48,118
利普
Lip!

172

Lip!

173
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,122
别走
Please stop!

174
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:53,323
求你了
Please!

175
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:55,992
我们还没好好说句话呢
We haven't had a chance to talk.

176
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:57,293
还有什么好谈的
Don't worry about it.

177
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:58,995
我想谈谈
No, I do.

178
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:01,798
我 天呐
I... Oh, geez.

179
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:03,833
我不知道从哪儿说起
I don't know where to start.

180
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:05,635
怎么向你解释
How to explain.

181
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:09,205
我一直担心你
I worry about you.

182
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,409
我无时无刻不在想你
I think about you all the time.

183
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:14,344
我很想你
I miss you.

184
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:16,346
我有那么多问题想问你
There's so much I want to ask you.

185
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,614
学校怎么样
How's school?

186
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:22,986
你一直都那么聪明
You were always so smart.

187
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,455
我的利普
My Lip.

188
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:28,992
我知道你无所不能
I know you can do anything.

189
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:31,895
对不起我伤害了你
I'm so sorry I hurt you.

190
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:37,267
看着我
Oh, look at me.

191
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:47,143
下次你想回家来看看
Next time you're thinking about dropping in,

192
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:49,512
就免了吧
don't.

193
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:51,414
你已经把我们祸害得够惨了
You've fucked up our lives enough already.

194
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:01,724

196
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:05,361
我一直挺喜欢那个的
Ooh, I always liked that one. Mm-hmm.

197
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:07,697
除了那位爱尔兰女士 她好奇怪
Except the Irish lady. She's weird.

198
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:10,333
TBS也要联播"硝烟"
Gunsmoke marathon on TBS, too.

199
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,001
你说我们能给它喷漆吗
Think we could get it painted?

200
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,439
- 我说车 - 你想怎样都行 我的小公主
- The car. - Anything you want, Princess.

201
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:19,209
我很骄傲 你居然决定参加
I am just so proud of you for deciding to go to

202
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:21,110
贞洁舞会 让我以上帝希望的方式 
the Purity Ball and letting me protect you

203
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,179
来保护你
the way Jesus intended, huh?

204
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:25,181
- 上学愉快 亲爱的 - 拜拜 妈妈
- Have fun at school, sweetie. - Bye, Mom.

205
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:29,052
弗兰克
Frank.

206
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:31,354
我做了山莓馅的比利时煎饼
I made Belgian crepes with raspberries,

207
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:33,656
还给你浇了点枫糖浆
and there's a little maple syrup for you.

208
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:34,657
没时间吃了 我要迟到了
Uh, can't. I'm late.

209
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:35,892
你要去哪儿
Where you going?

210
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:37,427
我跟你说了
I told you.

211
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:39,929
我要去接上莫妮卡 然后去市政办公室
I'm picking up Monica, going to the city clerk's office,

212
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:41,698
签好和解书 拿到那笔钱
signing the settlement and getting the money.

213
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:44,434
那个... 莫妮卡
So... Monica?

214
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:45,735
对 莫妮卡
Yes, Monica.

215
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:48,037
你也想让我得到那笔钱 不是吗
You want me to get the money, don't you?

216
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:49,372
这是唯一的原因吗
Is that the only reason?

217
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:51,608
- 当然 - 弗兰克
- Yes. - Frank?

218
00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:53,243
你晚上回来吃饭吗
Are you coming home for dinner?

219
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:54,444
- 当然回来吃 - 确定吗
- Absolutely. - You sure?

220
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:55,612
对 确定 我要迟到了
Yes, Yes. I'm late.

221
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:56,813
要迟到了
I'm late.

222
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,737
操
Fuck.

223
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:29,979
谢天谢地我们明天就走了
Thank God we're leaving tomorrow.

224
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:31,915
- 我觉得我不能走 - 不 你可以的
- I don't think I can. - Yes, you can.

225
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:33,249
孩子们需要我
These kids need me.

226
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:34,717
他们能照顾好自己的
They're fine.

227
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:37,287
你没看见利普的样子吗 他多伤心啊
You didn't see Lip? How brokenhearted he was?

228
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:39,455
亲爱的 过一阵子他就没事了
Oh, honey, he'll get over it.

229
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,125
我们不能把利亚姆从他哥哥姐姐们身边带走
We can't take Liam from his brothers and sisters.

230
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,793
他要跟我们一起走
He's coming with us.

231
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:46,229
不 这是上天给我的预示
No. The universe is giving me a sign.

232
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:49,265
给了我机会成为理想中的那个母亲
An opportunity to be the mother I never could be.

233
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,367
离开这群孩子我一直很愧疚
I always felt guilty about leaving those kids.

234
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,104
我现在好多了 我觉得我能做到
I'm-I'm better now. I think I can handle it.

235
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,043
是的
Yeah.

236
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,011
看着我
Look at me.

237
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:04,948
莫妮卡 听着
Monica! Look... Uh-uh.

238
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:08,117
看着我
Look at me.

239
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:10,486
我们相遇的时候 你就像只丧家犬
When we met, you were like a beaten dog,

240
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,355
命悬一线
barely hanging on by a thread.

241
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:14,290
我现在坚强多了
I am stronger now.

242
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:17,994
如果我们留下来 你能撑多久呢 宝贝
But for how long if we stay here, baby?

243
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:20,430
能撑多久
For how long, hmm?

244
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:24,701
我们拿到DNA结果
We're getting the DNA results, then

245
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:26,736
就带上利亚姆离开这里
we're leaving with Liam.

246
00:11:28,872 --> 00:11:31,941
哎哟
Oh-ho.

247
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:34,944
希望我没有打扰你们的睡衣派对 莫妮
I hope I'm not interrupting a pajama party, Moni.

248
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:36,980
这就是你们这俩娘们儿常在一起干的事 对吗
That's what you ladies do when you're together, right?

249
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:38,448
枕头大战之类的
Pillow fights and the like?

250
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:41,818
你倒希望有个跟我的一样大的老二
You wish you had a dick as big as mine.

251
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:44,621
我的那条可是又粗又长
I am a man of ample girth and length.

252
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:46,456
不信你问莫妮
Ask Moni.

253
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,460
如果你觉得隔着牛仔裤看不出什么
If I seem unimpressive in my Wranglers, it's because

254
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:52,829
那是因为我不喜炫耀 膨胀取胜
I'm a grower, not a shower.

255
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:53,772
不过相信我 
But trust me, 

256
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:56,499
如果需要大展拳脚的话 我那可生机勃勃
when it's time to show, I grow.

257
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,201
来吧 盖夫人
Come on, Mrs. G.

258
00:11:58,235 --> 00:11:59,636
我们开路吧
Let's hit the road.

259
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,405
老弗的钞票就要到手了
Frankie's got some moolah coming his way.

260
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:03,673
计划有变 老弗
Change of plans, Frankie.

261
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:07,143
除非你征得利普 菲奥娜和孩子们的同意
Monica's not signing those papers

262
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,012
让我们带走利亚姆
until you get Lip, Fiona and

263
00:12:09,046 --> 00:12:11,514
否则莫妮卡是不会签字的
the kids on board with us taking Liam.

264
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:12,197
什么 
What? 

265
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,184
莫妮卡得确定孩子们不会恨她
Monica needs to know that the kids aren't going to hate her.

266
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:16,519
太迟了 他们早就恨她入骨了
It's too late. They already hate her.

267
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:17,787
别逼我们 弗兰克
Don't push it, Frank.

268
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,288
我们可本来能索取
We could be asking

269
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,858
离婚赡养费以及你那一半的赔偿费
for the spousal support and half the settlement money.

270
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:26,195
算你狠
Fine.

271
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,197
菲奥娜在哪
Where's Fiona?

272
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:29,599
隔壁
Next door.

273
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,567
她搬去和史蒂夫一起住了
She moved in with Steve.

274
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:34,537
史蒂夫是哪个傻逼
Who the fuck is Steve?

275
00:12:45,883 --> 00:12:47,850
天啊

00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,683
而卡什因为我才对米奇开枪的
And Kash shot Mickey because of me,

419
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,453
可是米奇宁愿去少管所也不愿承认他是同性恋
but Mickey would rather go to juvie than admit he's gay.

420
00:18:57,487 --> 00:19:00,022
所以 我和卡什还有米奇都干过了
So, I'm doing both Kash and Mickey.

421
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:03,025
噢 最近和卡什没怎么做过
Well, not so much Kash lately.

422
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,261
不过我和卡什打得火热那会儿
But when Kash and me were hot and heavy,

423
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:06,562
被琳达发现了
Linda found out about it,

424
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:08,664
然后她强迫卡什给她再生个孩子
and is blackmailing Kash into having another kid.

425
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:11,000
一团糟啊
Holy shit.

426
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:13,169
是啊
Yeah.

427
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:16,672
她们出来了
Here they come.

428
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:21,844
我打算今天去见见他
I think I'm gonna go see him today.

429
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:22,912
谁 卡什
Who? Kash?

430
00:19:22,946 --> 00:19:24,180
不 米奇
No. Mickey.

431
00:19:24,214 --> 00:19:25,781
他在监狱等着判决
He's in jail awaiting sentencing.

432
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:35,558
我想知道我要怎么才能
I want to know what I have to do to adopt

433
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,960
收养我年幼的弟弟以及其他的兄弟姐妹
my toddler brother and possibly my other siblings, as well,

434
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:39,395
尽可能的靠自己抚养他们
and raise them as my own.

435
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,030
你们的父母还健在吗
Are both your parents still alive?

436
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:42,565
- 是的 - 不称职吗
- Yes. - Incompetent?

437
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,967
非常不称职
Very.

438
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:47,269
好吧 你是在说
Okay, well, you're talking about

439
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:49,638
想撤销他们的监护权
vacating their parental rights and becoming

440
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:51,040
然后成为几个孩子的合法监护人来着
legal guardian of how many?

441
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:52,074
五个
Five.

442
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,876
噢 那还真是多啊
Oh, that's a lot of kids.

443
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,446
你要知道 法律中有关亲权的部分
You know, the law's pretty strict

444
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:58,614
是相当严格的
regarding parental rights.

445
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:00,616
你得证明他们的不称职
You'd need to prove incompetence.

446
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,951
你有确凿的证据吗
Do you have a case?

447
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:03,018
你有多少时间
How much time do you have?

448
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:04,086
我有一个文件夹
I have a folder.

449
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,855
你有一个文件夹 好吧
You got a folder. Okay.

450
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,293
看起来你的母亲...
Well, it looks like your mother...

451
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:12,495
莫妮卡
Monica.

452
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:14,630
莫妮卡几年前离开了
...Monica left a couple of years ago?

453
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:16,065
二十一个半月
21 and a half months.

454
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:17,233
她现在回来了吗
Is she back now?

455
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:18,501
算是吧
Sort of.

456
00:20:18,535 --> 00:20:20,102
还有你的父亲
And your father,

457
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:21,203
弗兰克盖拉格
Frank Gallagher...

458
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:22,671
哇 他的事情可真不少
Wow. He's a live one.

459
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:24,607
酒鬼一个
Drinker?

460
00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:32,148
对
Yeah.

461
00:20:32,182 --> 00:20:32,884
你挣的钱
Uh, do you make 

462
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:35,518
能达到六个人家庭的联邦贫困线吗
federal poverty level wages for a family of six?

463
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:36,719
那是多少钱
How much is that?

464
00:20:36,753 --> 00:20:38,787
一年大约三万吧
30 grand a year or so.

465
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,793
所以说 你挣的钱不足以赡养他们
So you don't earn enough money to support them,

466
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,862
而且我们还得证明你的父母不称职
and we'd have to prove your parents incompetent?

467
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:49,598
听着 我知道这很烦人
Listen, I know it bites the big one,

468
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,000
但最好的结果就是
but the best case scenario

469
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:53,235
在你和你父亲争夺抚养权的时候
is the county places your brothers and sisters

470
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,788
郡县把你的弟弟妹妹
in foster care 

471
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,138
送到寄养家庭照看
while you and your father fight over custody.

472
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,643
- 盖拉格女士 - 在这儿
- Mrs. Gallagher? - Yeah.

473
00:21:01,578 --> 00:21:03,145
- 谢谢你 - 不客气
- Thank you. - Yeah.

474
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:08,884
他是弗兰克的孩子
He's Frank's.

475
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:11,921
什么
What?!

476
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:13,155
弗兰克是他的父亲
Frank's the father.

477
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,224
这他妈怎么可能
How the fuck is this possible?

478
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:16,392
我不知道
I don't know.

479
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:17,960
我一直以为我是在斑马酒吧
I always thought I got pregnant

480
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:20,663
和那个酒保嗑药时怀的
when I did E with that bouncer at the Zebra Lounge.

481
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,164
我醒来时一丝不挂
I-I woke up naked.

482
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,699
法律还是站在我们这一边的
The law's still on our side.

483
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:24,867
什么
What?

484
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:27,036
你是母亲
You're the mother.

485
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,470
对
Yeah.

486
00:21:28,505 --> 00:21:30,105
那么我们今天找到弗兰克
So, we find Frank today,

487
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,408
告诉他我们会签署他的协议
tell him we'll sign his settlement papers

488
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:35,110
以换取他的抚养权
in exchange for him signing over his parental rights.

489
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:36,530
在那之后 
After that, 

490
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:38,747
菲奥娜无能为力了
there ain't a damn thing Fiona can do about it.

491
00:21:38,782 --> 00:21:40,416
我们走 莫妮卡
Come on, Monica.

492
00:21:43,286 --> 00:21:45,688
不能让他毁了我的家庭
He's not ruining my fucking family.

493
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:46,668
我向上帝发誓 
I swear to God, 

494
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,290
他休想把儿子从我身边带走
he's not going to take my son away from me.

495
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:50,626
操他大爷
Fucking the shit!

496
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:53,729
哇
Wow.

497
00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:55,731
她们看起来挺不高兴的
They look unhappy.

498
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:57,433
是啊
Yeah.

499
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:03,706
刚才走的那两个女人
Two women who just left

500
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,809
一定是对结果不满意啊 是吧
must not have not been happy with the news they got, huh?

501
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:08,210
对 这经常发生
Oh, yeah. Happens.

502
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,411
上个月有一个家伙
Had a guy last month

503
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:11,547
甚至在男厕所上吊了
hang himself from a pipe in the men's room.

504
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:14,617
那么 需要我帮忙吗
So, can I help you?

505
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:16,885
嗯 我想...
Yeah, uh, I think, uh...

506
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,555
我想或许你能帮的上忙
I think maybe you can.

507
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,272
你还要这样做多久 贾斯珀
How long you gonna keep this up, Jasper?

508
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,441
需要多久就多久
Well, as long as it takes this time.

509
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:15,778
保险公司已经不想再付钱给你了
Insurer is sick and tired of paying you.

510
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,012
他们知道你是装的
They know you're faking.

511
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,415
我要能证明 他们会付我一千元
Gonna pay me a thousand bucks for proving it.

512
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:27,089
嘿 贾斯珀
Hey, Jasper.

513
00:23:33,396 --> 00:23:35,364
莫妮卡
Monica!

514
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,434
你在吗
You here?

515
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:41,303
我跟菲奥娜谈过了
I talked to Fiona!

516
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:44,173
都妥了
Everything's good!

517
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:46,775
莫妮卡
Monica!

518
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,378
菲奥娜在哪呢
Where's Fiona?

519
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:24,546
她已经不住这儿了
Doesn't live here anymore.

520
00:24:24,581 --> 00:24:25,981
莫妮卡呢
Monica?

521
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:27,716
也不在
Nope.

522
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:31,019
我觉得我把胳膊摔断了
I think I broke my arm.

523
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:34,123
巨疼
It hurts a lot.

524
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,427
知道了
Yeah.

525
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:42,431
- 那一条胳膊 - 对
- That one? - Yeah.

526
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,334
啊 搞什么
Ow! What the...?!

527
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:48,070
去拿你的自行车
Go get your bike.

528
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:52,074
你确定你准备好了
You sure you're ready for this?

529
00:24:52,108 --> 00:24:53,942
当然了
Hell, yeah.

530
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:55,832
我是说 仅仅因为利亚姆是弗兰克的孩子 
I mean, just 'cause Liam's Frank's 

531
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:56,845
这不代表我们这几个人都是
doesn't mean the rest of us are.

532
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,980
对
Yeah.

533
00:24:59,015 --> 00:25:02,184
好了 这里写着
All right, it says here

534
00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:05,220
我们要做的就是
all we have to do is...

535
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:08,490
在自己脸颊内侧上刮一下 然后把它送回去
swab our own cheeks and send it back in.

536
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:11,193
对 还得每人付一百五十美元
Yeah, and pay them 150 bucks each.

537
00:25:11,227 --> 00:25:13,595
我们有微小的希望和弗兰克没有血缘关系
On the off chance we're not related to Frank,

538
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,264
这是完全值得的
it's totally worth it.

539
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:16,465
张开嘴
Open up.

540
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:20,002
实际上这挺酷的
It's actually pretty cool...

541
00:25:20,036 --> 00:25:22,037
这里面有很多东西
there's a lot of shit

542
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:24,406
可以让我们清楚地了解自己
we can figure out about ourselves in there.

543
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:28,076
对 比如我们是不是继承了弗兰克的酗酒基因
Yeah, like, uh, if we got the alcoholic gene from Frank.

544
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,546
是啊 或是莫妮卡的笨蛋基因
Yeah, or the dummy gene from Monica.

545
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,848
或者我们之中是否有人会成为同性恋
Or if any of us is gonna turn out to be gay.

546
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:33,882
真不错
Nice.

547
00:26:00,944 --> 00:26:02,611
就现在
Now!

548
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:10,886
卡尔
Carl!

549
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,354
卡尔
Carl!

550
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:14,957
卡尔 哦
Carl. Oh...

551
00:26:15,226 --> 00:26:17,559
我觉得你撞断了他的胳膊
I think you broke his arm.

552
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:18,560
哦 糟糕
Oh, shit!

553
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:20,229
我现在能去医院了吗
Can I go to the hospital now?

554
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:22,564
先给我几声惨叫
Just give me a couple of more yells first.

555
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:25,801
哦 我的孩子
Oh, my boy!

556
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,172
那烤肉闻起来棒极了
That roast smells amazing.

557
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,742
别打它的算盘了 那不是给你的
Don't get any ideas, it's not for you.

558
00:26:33,776 --> 00:26:37,212
弗兰克不会回来了 他和他的妻子在一起呢
Frank's not coming back. He's with his wife now.

559
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:41,617
我知道没人在这儿吃你做的美味
I know how disappointed you get

560
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:44,520
有多么令你沮丧
when nobody's here to eat your wonderful meals.

561
00:26:44,554 --> 00:26:46,154
妈妈
Mom!

562
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:49,057
我的连衣裙在哪里
Where is my dress?

563
00:26:49,092 --> 00:26:51,226
来吧 宝贝
Come on, sweet girl.

564
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:55,097
太棒了 好的...
It's so good. Okay...

565
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:57,833
太完美了
Perfect.

566
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,702
- 好了 让我把侧边拉链拉上 - 好的
- Okay, let me get the side zipper. - Okay.

567
00:27:00,737 --> 00:27:02,738
你看起来很漂亮
You look beautiful.

568
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:07,175
我的天呐
My goodness.

569
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,578
你...你看起来美极了
You... you look stunning.

570
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:16,919
我太为你自豪了
I am so proud of you.

571
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:20,956
好了 埃迪
All right, Eddie.

572
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,493
不如在去父女纯洁舞会之前
Why don't you just join us for dinner

573
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:27,129
和我们一起吃晚餐吧
before you both go to the Purity Ball?

574
00:27:27,163 --> 00:27:29,131
你确定吗
You're sure?

575
00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:33,068
我...给弗兰克留点菜就好了
I'll just...save a plate for Frank.

576
00:27:45,882 --> 00:27:48,050
谢谢你给我的物资供应帐户充了钱
Thanks for putting money in my commissary account.

577
00:27:45,882 --> 00:27:48,050
美国监狱中有专门想犯人出售日常生活用品的商定

578
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,018
我的烟快不够抽的了
I was running low on smokes.

579
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:51,720
不是我 是卡什充的钱
Not me. Kash.

580
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,990
我告诉他你可能还会上诉
I told him you might still press charges.

581
00:27:55,024 --> 00:27:57,025
谢谢了
Thanks.

582
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:03,498
判多久
How long?

583
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:07,135
我不知道 应该是一年吧
I don't know. Supposed to be a year, right?

584
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,172
如果我不做傻事的话可能只有几个月
Maybe only a couple months if I don't do anything stupid.

585
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:11,506
比如什么
Like what?

586
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:12,841
比如捅死那个
Like stab that fat

587
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,943
一直想偷我果冻的肥猪
fuckin' mick who keeps trying to steal my Jell-O!

588
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:16,612
- 说谁呢 我 - 就是你
- Who? Me? - Yeah!

589
00:28:16,646 --> 00:28:18,647
去你的
Fuck you!

590
00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:24,386
我...我想你了
I, I miss you.

591
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,671
你再说一次 
You say that again, 

592
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:27,756
我就把你的舌头扯下来
I'll rip your tongue out of your head.

593
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,168
- 把你的手从玻璃上拿开 - 哦
- Take your hand off the glass. - Oh.

594
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:29,683
晚上好 警官 没什么事吧
Good evening, Officer. Is everything okay?

595
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:30,551
我不知道 有事吗
I don't know. Is it?

596
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:32,453
哦 嘿 托尼 你怎么样
Oh. Hey. Tony, how you doing?

597
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,081
很好
Good.

598
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:37,392
那么...我做错什么事了吗
So... did I do something wrong?

599
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:39,161
尾灯灭了吗
Taillight out?

600
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,395
胎压太低了吗
Low tire?

601
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,564
不不不 祝贺你买了新房子
No, no, no, uh, congratulations on the new house.

602
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:46,034
哦对
Yeah.

603
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:48,837
对 在那一片还算不错的房子
Yeah, yeah, nice little fixer-upper in the neighborhood.

604
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:51,206
不过有点吵 隔壁有很多小孩
Hear the neighbors can be loud, though, lots of kids.

605
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:54,609
- 菲奥娜是个好女孩 - 是最好的
- Fiona's a good girl. - The best.

606
00:29:54,644 --> 00:29:56,289
我们从小就认识 
Known her since we were in Head Start. 

607
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,112
很多年了
Long time, you know?

608
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:03,652
只要...小心驾车就好
Just... drive carefully.

609
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:06,054
你不会想因为开车受伤的
You don't want to get hurt down here.

610
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,933
嗯 这个真好吃
Mm, this is good.

611
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:21,136
我很好奇今晚在纯洁舞会
So, I'm just curious about what happens

612
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,638
到底都做些什么
at the Purity Ball tonight.

613
00:30:23,673 --> 00:30:26,141
呃 这是一个基督教的活动 目的是
Well, it's a Christian event designed to 

614
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:27,739
增强父女之间的亲情关系
strengthen the bond between fathers and daughters.

615
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,777
我们订立一个纯洁的契约 就像宣誓一样
We make a covenant of purity. Like an oath.

616
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:33,990
接下来我们交换承诺戒 
And then we exchange promise rings 

617
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:36,983
然后我们做一些贞洁的祷告
and, uh, we do some chastity prayers.

618
00:30:36,985 --> 00:30:37,518
很有趣的
It's fun.

619
00:30:38,688 --> 00:30:41,423
哇
Wow.

620
00:30:41,457 --> 00:30:45,026
他们有没有给青年男子的这种舞会
Do they have these, um, balls for young men?

621
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:47,062
为什么要有
Why would they?

622
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:52,334
笑一个
Ready to smile?

623
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:55,837
哦 这一张太棒了
Aw. Oh, that's so nice!

624
00:30:55,872 --> 00:30:57,839
太漂亮了
It's beautiful.

625
00:30:57,874 --> 00:31:00,075
再来一张 再来一张
One more, one more.

626
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,510
再来一张 再来一张
One more, one more.

627
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:03,011
太有爱了
It's so nice.

628
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:05,113
噢耶
Oh, yeah!

629
00:31:05,148 --> 00:31:06,248
嘿 你回来了
Hey, you're back!

630
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,283
那是当然
Oh, hell yeah.

631
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:10,318
给那个贾斯珀上了一课
Showed that Jasper a thing or two.

632
00:31:12,222 --> 00:31:14,687
那个混蛋会求着我别去起诉他
Bastard's going to be begging me not to sue him.

633
00:31:14,697 --> 00:31:16,591
给爷来杯好酒
Let us have a bottle of your good stuff.

634
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:17,959
我有钱要入账了
I've got some money coming.

635
00:31:17,994 --> 00:31:19,828
等你死了 我去参加你的葬礼
You know, when you die, I'm gonna go to your funeral

636
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:21,463
我要唱首歌
and I'm gonna sing a song.

637
00:31:21,497 --> 00:31:23,992
歌词是这样的 "我要有钱了..." 天呐
It goes, I got money coming  Oh boy. 

638
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,768
猜你现在后悔没做结扎手术了吧
Bet you wish you'd had that vasectomy by now, huh?

639
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,697
我觉得你可能想知道卡尔没有大碍
Just thought you'd want to know Carl's all right.

640
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:34,309
他们把他的胳膊复位了
They re-set his arm.

641
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,410
对 所以请你坐在凳子上
Yeah, so please stay on your barstool,

642
00:31:35,444 --> 00:31:36,511
继续喝酒吧
and just keep drinking.

643
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:37,846
嘿
Hey.

644
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,848
我们还是办正事吧
Let's just do what we came here to do.

645
00:31:39,882 --> 00:31:43,819
如果你想要钱 我一点也没有
If you're looking for money, I don't have any yet.

646
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:45,687
你妈还没有签署我的理赔协议
Your mom still hasn't signed my settlement papers.

647
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:47,355
我不知道她整天都去哪
I don't know where she's been all day.

648
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,591
她去拿利亚姆的DNA检查结果了
She's been getting Liam's DNA results.

649
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,026
祝贺你 你还是父亲
Congratulations, you're still the father.

650
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,595
你说真的吗
Are you serious?

651
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:57,032
哦 我就知道那都是谣言
Ooh. I thought that was always a rumor

652
00:31:57,066 --> 00:31:58,500
说什么盖拉格夫人跟那个萨克斯风手
about Nana Gallagher having an affair

653
00:31:58,534 --> 00:32:00,035
有一腿
with that sax player.

654
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:01,187
向我保证你不会
Promise you won't sign anything

655
00:32:01,188 --> 00:32:03,104
签署任何放弃抚养权的协议
 forfeiting parental rights.

656
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:07,342
得了吧 你知道莫妮卡不是个好母亲
Come on! You know what a bad mother Monica is.

657
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:09,477
我只是假装让她以为她能带走他
I'm just letting her pretend that she can have him

658
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,846
这样我才能拿到我的理赔金
so I can get my settlement.

659
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,814
如果她不会就轻易放弃怎么办
What if she doesn't give up that easy?

660
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:15,050
不不不 这是一个双赢的情况
No, no, no, this is a win-win situation.

661
00:32:15,084 --> 00:32:17,519
我是说 即使她带他走了一阵子
I mean, even if she takes him for just a little while,

662
00:32:17,553 --> 00:32:18,854
她也会回来的
she'll be back.

663
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:21,690
哭诉自己自尊心低下
Crying about her low self-esteem,

664
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:24,292
或声称男孩有多么需要他的父亲
or how boys actually need their fathers,

665
00:32:24,327 --> 00:32:26,228
再或者恐惧阴茎
or penis grief.

666
00:32:26,262 --> 00:32:28,997
意思是说你大半夜的时候醒来
That's when you wake up in the middle of the night

667
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,066
看着身旁躺着的那个人 然后你说
and you look at the person next to you, and you say,

668
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,467
"谁来帮帮我 我刚刚干了一个小姐"
"Somebody help me! I just fucked a lady."

669
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:35,370
我从没求过你任何东西 从来没有
I've never asked you for anything. Ever.

670
00:32:35,404 --> 00:32:38,974
拜托 能不能让我缓一缓
Oh, come on. Will you please give me some time with this?

671
00:32:39,008 --> 00:32:40,709
我能搞定 只要别给我压力
I can do this, I, just don't pressure me.

672
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:42,344
我得走开了
I've gotta walk away.

673
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:42,995
什么 
What? 

674
00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:44,846
如果我不走 非得痛扁他不可
If I don't walk away, I'm going to fucking hit him.

675
00:32:46,082 --> 00:32:47,682
管他呢
What the hell?

676
00:32:51,454 --> 00:32:53,421
该死
Fuck!

677
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:00,995
小黛比
Debs.

678
00:33:02,698 --> 00:33:05,152
你要这么做 就不再是我们的父亲
If you do this, you are on your own, 

679
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:09,070
我没开玩笑 我受够了 我走了
and I'm not kidding. I'm done. I'm gone.

680
00:33:09,105 --> 00:33:09,872
胡说
Bullshit.

681
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:12,188
你永远也离不开那些猴孩子们 
You'll never leave those monkeys, 

682
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:13,241
你太爱他们了
you love them too much.

683
00:33:13,276 --> 00:33:16,244
这群孩子啊
Kids.

684
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:18,513
在我们开始之前 我先说两句
Before we begin, let me just say 

685
00:33:18,514 --> 00:33:21,950
你们愿意净化身心 我们是多么自豪
how proud we are of your desire to re-purify.

686
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:24,619
我女儿们参加过这个仪式
My daughters participated, and now,

687
00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:27,022
即使至今还是单身
although still single, are enjoying

688
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:29,357
但她的生活无比圣洁
very spirit-filled lives.

689
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:30,892
帕蒂
Patty?

690
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:33,161
你想不想起个头
Would you like to start?

691
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,232
去年我唱小曲那段时间
Last year when I was singing madrigal,

692
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,434
我开始和唱诗班的一个男孩约会
I started dating a boy in the choir.

693
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:42,804
他说我们在交往 但我们除了在排练厅亲热外
He said we were dating, but we never met outside of

694
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:45,106
我们没在外面见过面
our make-out sessions in the rehearsal hall.

695
00:33:45,141 --> 00:33:47,876
我不断地让他摸我
I repeatedly let him touch me

696
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:52,781
透过我的衬衫和胸罩 摸我的胸部
on my breasts, through my shirt and bra.

697
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:54,582
然后有一次 我感觉到他的...
And once, I felt his...

698
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:57,285
他的棒棒碰我的腿
his rod touch my leg.

699
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,064
这太尴尬了 
This is so embarrassing. 

700
00:33:58,065 --> 00:33:59,554
我不敢相信我居然让他那么做
I can't believe I let him do this.

701
00:33:59,588 --> 00:34:01,589
- 我很抱歉 - 谢谢你 帕蒂
- I'm so sorry. - Thank you, Patty.

702
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:02,941
感谢你鼓起勇气
I want to thank you for your courage 

703
00:34:02,942 --> 00:34:05,260
直面自己对欲望的挣扎
to confront your struggles with desire.

704
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:07,162
谁是下一个
Who's next?

705
00:34:07,196 --> 00:34:09,431
伊莱恩
Elaine?

706
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,435
大家好
Hi.

707
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,003
我叫伊莱恩
My name is Elaine,

708
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:18,239
我只碰过一个...
and I only touched one...

709
00:34:18,274 --> 00:34:20,108
阴茎
penis.

710
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,077
只有那一次
Once.

711
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:24,779
如果我不这么做的话 他会用管子打我
If I didn't, I was going to get hit with a pipe.

712
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:28,750
上帝啊 你为何要让我的女儿成为
God, why did you let my daughter become a slave

713
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:30,018
肉体的奴隶
to the flesh?

714
00:34:30,052 --> 00:34:32,253
不然就会挨铁管打的呀
I was going to get hit with a pipe!

715
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:38,927
所以律师的意思是你束手无策吗
So the lawyer said there's nothing you can do?

716
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:41,463
我们若上诉 可能适得其反 情况会更糟
If we sue, it could backfire. Make things worse.

717
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:48,036
天啊 这地方闻着全是老家伙哈里森的味道
Jesus. This place still smells like old man Harris.

718
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,437
莫妮卡想要干什么
What did Monica want?

719
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,139
她想让我们过去吃晚饭
She wants us to come over for dinner.

720
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,941
搞个家庭聚会什么的
Some kind of a family meeting.

721
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:54,109
家庭
Family?

722
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:55,310
真他妈的操蛋
Fucking load of shit.

723
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,878
你告诉她我们知道利亚姆是弗兰克的孩子吗
You told her we know Liam is Frank's?

724
00:34:56,912 --> 00:34:57,879
说了
Yeah.

725
00:35:00,149 --> 00:35:01,850
你有没有大麻
You have any pot?

726
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:03,651
我觉得如果我清醒着去见老妈
I think if I have to go see Mom conscious,

727
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,110
我说不定会动粗
I might actually commit a violent felony.

728
00:35:05,111 --> 00:35:05,987
那可是很久以来
That's the first time

729
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:08,590
你第一次叫她老妈
in a long time I've heard you call her Mom.

730
00:35:08,924 --> 00:35:09,924
我叫了吗
I did?

731
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:13,595
我不知道是否真把她当做过自己的老妈
I don't know if I ever really felt like she was my mom.

732
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:16,864
伊恩和我做了DNA测试
Ian and I got our DNA tests done.

733
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:18,867
为什么
Why?

734
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:19,901
我不知道 可能是对
I don't know, got excited

735
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:22,103
不是弗兰克的孩子这一想法比较兴奋吧
at the idea of not being Frank's, and

736
00:35:22,138 --> 00:35:23,371
如果我们都不是他的孩子
if none of us are his, then

737
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:24,506
那么你成为我们的监护人
you'd have a much easier time becoming

738
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,807
也就会轻松很多
our legal guardians.

739
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:28,299
利普一个小时之后去取结果
Lip's gonna pick up the results in about an hour.

740
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:32,580
那么 但愿你们不是弗兰克的孩子吧
Well...here's to you not being Frank's.

741
00:35:37,253 --> 00:35:39,854
我一直表现得不太淑女
My actions have been unladylike

742
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:44,025
像出于本能 对此我真的很抱歉
and base in nature, and for that I am truly sorry.

743
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,693
凯伦
Karen.

744
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:49,397
为了得到全身心的净化
In order for you to receive the full gift of purity,

745
00:35:49,432 --> 00:35:52,934
你要尽可能的坦白
you need to be as honest as you can.

746
00:35:52,968 --> 00:35:55,637
没事 宝贝
It's okay, sweetheart.

747
00:35:55,671 --> 00:35:58,073
就说说都发生了什么
Just tell what happened.

748
00:35:58,107 --> 00:36:02,510
那好吧
Um, well, okay.

749
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:05,980
我很小的时候就开始给人口交
I started having oral sex at a very young age, 

750
00:36:06,015 --> 00:36:07,549
大概是十三岁吧
maybe 13.

751
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,617
是和邻里的几个家伙
It was guys around the neighborhood...

752
00:36:09,652 --> 00:36:11,052
起初是三四个
three or four at first

753
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:14,823
后来就不止三四个
and then, well, more than three or four.

754
00:36:14,857 --> 00:36:18,393
直到八年级 我才又了真正的性行为
I didn't have intercourse until the eighth grade.

755
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:19,183
一开始我并不享受
I didn't like it at first, 

756
00:36:19,184 --> 00:36:20,361
但差不多六次的时候
but then around the sixth time,

757
00:36:20,396 --> 00:36:22,163
我开始感觉很爽
it started to feel good,

758
00:36:22,198 --> 00:36:24,466
相当爽
really good,

759
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,967
但我并不引以为傲
but I didn't feel good about it.

760
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:30,004
有几次我嗨翻的时候
Um, there was a few times where I got high

761
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:34,008
开始尝试男生女生
and started experimenting with guys and girls

762
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:35,810
一起搞
at the same time.

763
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:37,599
我觉得倒也算不上是群P
I wouldn't necessarily call it an orgy,

764
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:41,082
但的确放眼望去全是裸体
but there were a lot of naked body parts flying around,

765
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:43,818
让人觉得非常爽
which felt very good but kind of bad

766
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:46,087
但同时又很内疚
all at the same time.

767
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:48,756
后来有次在明蒂卡尔森家过夜
And then there was the time at Mindy Carlson's sleepover

768
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:49,824
我们一起去洗澡
when we all got in the shower

769
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,460
然后相互涂肥皂
and started soaping each other up,

770
00:36:52,495 --> 00:36:54,195
后来她妈妈进来了 大吃一惊
and then her mom walked in and freaked out

771
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,930
因为她看到明蒂
when she saw Mindy in the shower with a big,

772
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,499
戴着一个粗大的黑色假阳具
black strap-on dildo.

773
00:36:57,533 --> 00:36:58,500
你这个婊子
You whore!

774
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,703
婊子没有资格要车
Whores don't get cars!

775
00:37:03,506 --> 00:37:05,140
好了
Okay.

776
00:37:05,174 --> 00:37:08,843
来了 大家都饿了吧
There, I hope everybody's hungry.

777
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,817
快吃吧 伊恩 这是你最爱吃的
There you go, Ian, it's your favorite.

778
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:17,018
这是什么
What is it?

779
00:37:17,052 --> 00:37:18,353
意大利千层面啊
Lasagna.

780
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:22,957
卡尔 你能把沙拉递过来吗
Carl, could you start passing the salad, please?

781
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:23,948
莫妮卡是利亚姆的生母
Monica is Liam's mother, 

782
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:27,295
- 我知道你们会不高兴 但是 - 老天 
- and I know you won't be happy, but... - Jesus,

783
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:32,329
鲍比 我们不能开开心心用餐 饭后再谈
Bob, can we just enjoy our dinner and then talk after...?

784
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,534
谈什么
Talk about what?

785
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,535
黛比 
Debbie,

786
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:35,236
拜托
please.

787
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:36,504
利普呢
Where's Lip?

788
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:37,938
他有事
Had something to do.

789
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:38,940
他不来吗
He's not coming?

790
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:40,675
抱歉 我回来晚了
Sorry I-I'm late.

791
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:42,576
还有吃的吗
Did I miss the chow?

792
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:45,046
看上去不错啊
Ooh... looks good.

793
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,781
如果你把我们都叫过来是要告诉我们
If you called us here to tell us

794
00:37:46,815 --> 00:37:48,349
你要带走利亚姆并再次离开的话
that you're taking Liam and leaving again,

795
00:37:48,384 --> 00:37:50,418
我们不想听
we don't want to hear it.

796
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:52,774
菲奥娜 你不爽 我明白
Fiona, you're upset, I get it.

797
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:55,023
我嫁给弗兰克十八年了
I was married to Frank for 18 years.

798
00:37:55,057 --> 00:37:59,093
我明白 每天就像在生吞玻璃渣
I know, it's like swallowing broken glass every day.

799
00:38:01,096 --> 00:38:04,365
利普 太好了 我们刚开饭
Oh, Lip, wonderful. We just started.

800
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,534
你妈妈跟你说六点半开饭
Your mother said 6:30.

801
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:08,702
你手表丢了吗
You lose your watch?

802
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:09,567
我没有手表 鲍比
I don't have a watch, Bob.

803
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:11,105
什么结果
What's the news?

804
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,408
还没打开 我觉得我们应该一起看
Haven't opened it yet. Figured we should do it together.

805
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:15,109
谢谢
Thanks.

806
00:38:15,344 --> 00:38:19,614
我跟伊恩决定也去做个DNA鉴定
Me and Ian decided to get our DNA tests done, too,

807
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,884
真希望我们不是弗兰克的孩子啊
on the off chance that maybe we aren't Frank's kids.

808
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:23,818
什么
What?

809
00:38:23,852 --> 00:38:25,920
你和鲍比测得那么开心
Yeah. We figured why should you and Bob

810
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:27,989
我们也玩玩
get to have all the fun?

811
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:32,727
我靠
Holy shit.

812
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:36,698
恭喜你 伊恩
Congratulations, Ian.

813
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:40,535
你不是弗兰克盖拉格的儿子
You are not Frank Gallagher's son.

814
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:54,649
妈的
Fuck!

815
00:38:54,683 --> 00:38:56,084
凯伦
Karen?

816
00:38:56,118 --> 00:38:57,885
宝贝儿
Sweetie...

817
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,720
甜心
Honey?

818
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:03,558
宝贝 你这么快就从舞会上回来了
Sweetie, you're back from the ball so soon?

819
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:06,995
亲爱的
Honey?

820
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:10,031
凯伦
Karen?

821
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,901
还许诺要他妈的给我辆车
He promised me the fucking car!

822
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:16,971
凯伦 亲爱的 怎么回事
Karen, sweetie, what's going on?

823
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:19,674
还说为我感到骄傲
I'm so proud of you!

824
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:22,043
什么你让我想起我第一次的圣餐仪式
You remind me of my first communion!

825
00:39:22,077 --> 00:39:23,745
他竟然羞辱我
He humiliated me!

826
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,848
他让我以为他是爱我的
He made me think he loved me!

827
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:44,732
坦白说 宝贝
Honestly, sweetie,

828
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:46,734
我不知道
I don't know.

829
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:49,304
1995年夏天有那么一周
There was that week in the summer of '95

830
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:51,506
我嗑了很多天使粉
that I did a lot of PCP.

831
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,207
- 然后我 - 你嗑了天使粉
- And I... - You did PCP?

832
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,410
不带上我吗
Without me?!

833
00:39:55,444 --> 00:39:58,392
你保证过我们要一起嗑的
You promised we would do that together!

834
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:00,981
打断一下 能不能回到谁是伊恩生父的问题上
Excuse me. Can we get back to who Ian's father is?

835
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:03,751
莫妮卡背着弗兰克偷情 这挺好
I like the idea of Monica cheating on Frank, you know?

836
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:06,521
这让我对你的好印象得以保留 老妈
It really keeps my image of you right on track, Mom.

837
00:40:06,555 --> 00:40:08,588
有没有人能告诉我
Will somebody please tell me

838
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:10,925
我们在谈论什么呢
what we're talking about?

839
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,526
好吧 结果表明
All right, the results say

840
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,862
你 弗兰克 铁定不是我亲生父亲
that you, Frank, are absolutely not my father.

841
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,464
但我生父是你的亲戚
But my father is a close relative,

842
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:18,966
非常可能是你的一个兄弟
most likely one of your brothers.

843
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:20,868
爸爸还有兄弟吗
Dad has brothers?

844
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:21,769
有两个是吧
He has two, right?

845
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:23,703
三个
Three.

846
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:25,073
我见过的那个兄弟
You know, I think I met the one

847
00:40:25,107 --> 00:40:26,607
是用汽车的后备箱
that sells smoked sausage and razor blades

848
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:28,309
卖熏肠和剃须刀片的
out of the trunk of his car.

849
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,644
好吧
All right.

850
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,280
我真不知道
I-I honestly don't know.

851
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:37,150
我们还是一家人吗
Are we still related?

852
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,685
你们当然是啊
Of course you are.

853
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,422
你不但背着我嗑天使粉
Not only did you lie to me about the PCP,

854
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:45,092
还上了我的兄弟 接下来是什么
you fucked my brother! What's next?

855
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:49,162
你是不是还准备找一个黑人女爷们儿
You gonna take up with a black lady/man?

856
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,466
我忘了 你已经找了一个
Oh, I forgot, that's already happened.

857
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,502
现在我们还怎么复合
How can we get back together now?

858
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:59,172
我从来都没想过
I have never, ever had any intention of getting back

859
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,474
要跟你复合 弗兰克
together with you, Frank.

860
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:02,609
看在老天的份上 你把我骗回来
For Chrissake, you only tricked me into coming here

861
00:41:02,643 --> 00:41:04,845
就是想拿到那笔理赔金
to get some settlement money!

862
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,680
我也想见见你
I wanted to see you again.

863
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,015
所以你就骗她赢了个泰迪熊吗
So you pretended that she won a teddy bear?

864
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,518
你知道我有多爱泰迪熊
You know how much I love teddy bears.

865
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,620
你跟莫妮卡完了 弗兰克
You and Monica are over, Frank.

866
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:15,155
我跟莫妮卡就要结婚了
Me and Monica are getting married.

867
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:17,991
扯淡 她还没跟我离婚呢
Aah! She's still married to me.

868
00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:20,227
快了 她要跟你离婚
Not for long. She's getting a divorce.

869
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:22,129
你们俩还没离婚吗
You two are still married?

870
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:24,030
两个女人怎么结婚
How can two ladies get married?

871
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,499
他们是同性恋
They're lesbians.

872
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:27,667
不插入也可以做爱
Penetration isn't required for sex to occur.

873
00:41:30,338 --> 00:41:31,972
怎么 现在许多州同性结婚都是合法的
What? It's legal now in several states.

874
00:41:32,006 --> 00:41:32,973
离了吧 弗兰克
Divorce, Frank.

875
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:34,508
这个是你欠她的
You owe her at least that much.

876
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:36,843
那她欠我的怎么还
What about what she owes me?!

877
00:41:36,878 --> 00:41:39,646
她还要再次把六个孩子留给我吗
She gonna leave me again with six kids?

878
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,082
让我来处理这堆烂摊子
Leave me to deal with all the shit?

879
00:41:42,116 --> 00:41:43,683
应该说又把这烂摊子交给我了吧
You mean leave me to deal with the shit.

880
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:45,152
我没有抛弃你
I didn't leave you!

881
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:47,020
是你把我逼走的
You drove me out!

882
00:41:47,054 --> 00:41:49,356
任何有自尊的人都不会和你在一起 弗兰克
No self-respecting person could stay with you, Frank!

883
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,159
- 你待我就像对待一只狗 - 你
- You treated me like a dog! - You...

884
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:55,262
你得让我们来抚养利亚姆
You need to let us raise Liam.

885
00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:56,830
我才不管亲子鉴定结果是什么
I don't care what the test results say.

886
00:41:56,864 --> 00:41:58,698
利亚姆应该跟我们生活在一起
Liam belongs with us!

887
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,333
谁也不能带走利亚姆
Nobody's taking Liam!

888
00:42:00,368 --> 00:42:02,669
真不敢相信你竟然想和我离婚
I can't believe you want a divorce.

889
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:08,442
我和鲍比值得拥有自己的家庭
Me and Bob deserve a family of our own.

890
00:42:08,476 --> 00:42:10,544
你已经有个家庭了 只不过你抛弃了而已
You had a family! You left it!

891
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:14,181
我没想离开你们 是他逼我的
I didn't leave you! He drove me out!

892
00:42:14,215 --> 00:42:16,016
你本该留下来保护我们的
You should have protected us!

893
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,418
我尽力了 可是我办不到
I tried, but I couldn't!

894
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,488
菲奥娜 如果我没走 我早就死了
Fiona, if I didn't leave, I would have died!

895
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:23,857
别胡扯了 莫娜罗伊
Oh, cut the shit, Myrna Loy.

896
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:23,857
电影中的好老婆形象

897
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:28,028
你们根本不知道跟他过日子是什么样
You have no idea what it was like being married to him.

898
00:42:28,062 --> 00:42:30,430
你们也不知道我们的婚姻有多糟糕
You have no idea how bad it is!

899
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,531
是吗 说说看
Yeah? Try me.

900
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:33,733
别胡扯了
Oh, come on now!

901
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:37,737
我知道他曾经折磨过你
Okay, I know that he tortured you.

902
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:39,559
我知道他毁了你
I know that he ruined you, 

903
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,075
但嫁给他的人可不是我们 妈妈
but we didn't marry him, Mom.

904
00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:43,176
是你
You did.

905
00:42:43,211 --> 00:42:48,114
如果你爱我们 不管是爱哪一个 爱多少
If you love us, any of us in any way,

906
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,550
你都会留下利亚姆 带上你的女朋友
you'll leave Liam, take your girlfriend,

907
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:54,421
坐上你们的卡车 再也别回来了
get in your truck and never come back.

908
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:58,925
可是
But...

909
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,209
我
I...

910
00:43:16,244 --> 00:43:17,511
我爱你们
I love you...

911
00:43:18,713 --> 00:43:20,947
真的
I do.

912
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,786
妈的
Shit.

913
00:43:31,726 --> 00:43:33,827
你到底是怎么回事
What's the matter with you?

914
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,861
她跟你说了吗
She tell you?

915
00:43:34,896 --> 00:43:37,297
她告诉你她说了些什么吗
She tell you what she said?

916
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:39,966
你竟然骂我们的女儿是婊子
You called our daughter a whore.

917
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:42,536
怎么不说说她是怎么对我的呢
How about what she did to me?!

918
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:46,039
滚出去 滚
Get out. Out.

919
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:47,874
- 什么 - 快滚

920
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:49,943
- 滚出去 - 她跟你说她是怎么对我的吗
- Get out! - Did she mention what she did to me?!

921
00:43:49,977 --> 00:43:51,311
- 你明不明白 - 快滚
- You understand? - Get out!

922
00:43:51,345 --> 00:43:54,114
她也是个人
She's a human being!

923
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:56,750
她应该被爱 而不是厌恶
She deserves love, not hate!

924
00:43:56,784 --> 00:43:59,152
你没在场 全都是熟人
You weren't there. I know all those people?

925
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:01,021
你有什么毛病 再也别回来了
What's the matter with you?! Don't ever come back!

快滚 再也别回来了
Get out! Don't ever come back!

928

929
00:44:17,104 --> 00:44:22,104
弗兰克 你知道埃迪对我的凯伦做了什么吗
Frank! Frank, did you see what Eddie did to my Karen?

930
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,946
你走出家门了

What are they doing?

939
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,944
像是在打包
Looks like packing.

940
00:44:57,979 --> 00:44:59,012
利亚姆呢
What about Liam?

941
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:04,117
隔着窗户看不清
I can't tell through the window.

942
00:45:04,151 --> 00:45:05,518

告诉他们利亚姆被绑架了

No matter what.

946
00:45:11,192 --> 00:45:14,995
