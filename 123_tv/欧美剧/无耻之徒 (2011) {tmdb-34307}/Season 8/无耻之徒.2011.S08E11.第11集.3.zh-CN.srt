1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,900
Across the world,
tens of thousands of people

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,740
have been part of a truly
remarkable scientific project.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,100
It's altering our understanding of
what made you the way you are today.

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,500
Scientists think they have
discovered in these people's lives

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,380
the secret of a healthy, happy,
long life...

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,020
for all of us.

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,020
Studying our journeys
from baby to adulthood

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,460
is revealing the most important
part of your life,

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,180
maybe one you can't even remember.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,460
The nine months
before you were born.

11
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,460
When we think of
what makes us unique,

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,700
we don't tend to think of
life before birth,

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,860
but we're finding out that life
before birth

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,260
is actually shaping
who we are and who we become.

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,780
The importance of those crucial
months before birth

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,180
has become one of the most
powerful and provocative
new ideas in science.

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,060
The whole idea
was extremely controversial.

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,940
It blew me away, actually.

19
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,940
It was an incredible idea,
a real paradigm shift.

20
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,980
Understanding what happened to us
in the mysterious world of the womb

21
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,340
holds the promise of living
not just longer lives,

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,500
but healthier and happier ones.

23
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,780
This is the story of one man's
struggle to unravel our destiny.

24
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,460
It begins in Britain
over 20 years ago.

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,740
Professor David Barker

26
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,220
had spent much of his life
as a practising doctor,

27
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,700
and he thought he'd discovered

28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,420
a way to predict the future
of each and every one of us.

29
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,180
He began to test this idea
on the people in this room.

30
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,700
They're not part of a scientific
research group or a hi-tech lab.

31
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,380
They are simply people who happen to
be born in Hertfordshire.

32
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,500
Very evocative.

33
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,980
This reminds me of
the way I used to go to school.

34
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,060
I used to walk along a road
past a ford every day,

35
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,540
and then in the summer we would play
in it just like these children do.

36
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,940
He believed from the moment
they were born,

37
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,820
scientific predictions could be made
about these people's lives.

38
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,500
I think their destiny is
in large part already wrought.

39
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,340
Much of their lifetime's well-being

40
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,020
and ability - mental ability,
physical ability and health -

41
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,620
is already determined.

42
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,700
How long they would live.

43
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,940
How healthy they would be.

44
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,380
Whether they would have
a happy and fulfilled old age.

45
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,980
Well, these people are clearly fit.

46
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,100
If you're still able to run
and win cups at 70,

47
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,940
you had a strong constitution.

48
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,220
He believed he could
make these predictions

49
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,860
using only the information
contained in these books -

50
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,740
the birth records of
the county of Hertfordshire.

51
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,580
The books record
the birth weights

52
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,620
and the weights at one
of these men and women,

53
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,300
and in those measurements

54
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,180
lie a description of the life
that lies ahead of them,

55
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,420
in terms of health.

56
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,900
David Barker believed
that in these records

57
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,940
he had found
a simple and powerful link

58
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,580
between a low weight at birth
and heart disease in later life.

59
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,820
The babies who go on to develop
coronary heart disease

60
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,860
were not abnormal in any way.

61
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,540
When they were born,
their arrival was greeted
with the usual enthusiasm.

62
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,820
But they were already marked.

63
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,340
The idea that future health
was linked to birth weight
became known as the Barker theory,

64
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,780
and it sounded too
simple to be true.

65
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,300
That's the first time
I've actually heard that,

66
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,900
that your weight at birth
determines what health risk

67
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,380
you're going to have
later on in life. That's weird.

68
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,340
Really? No.

69
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,020
No, I haven't, no.

70
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,420
I would not think that

71
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,300
that had any relation to a disease
later in your life.

72
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,980
I think it's more to do with
lifestyle factors and things
as you grow old,

73
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,700
so that your weight when
you're a child I can't imagine

74
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,860
would have a big impact on those
kind of factors when you're older.

75
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,180
Critics of the Barker theory

76
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,980
thought there were other
explanations for our health

77
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,020
and well-being in later life.

78
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,660
Conventional wisdom said we
turned out the way we did

79
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,740
because of what we ate as children,

80
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,940
or the lifestyle choices
we made as adults.

81
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,060
From diet to exercise,

82
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,100
we were encouraged to take control
of our own destiny,

83
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,420
and that a long and happy life
would be the result.

84
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,140
But David Barker
believed birth weight

85
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,620
was more important than lifestyle
when it came to future health.

86
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,420
His task was to turn
conventional wisdom on its head.

87
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,420
To silence his critics, David
embarked on a worldwide search.

88
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,580
He has travelled to
the four corners of the globe

89
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,700
to find crucial evidence
to back up his provocative theory.

90
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,780
Because to prove this theory,

91
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,340
he needed to show that
his ideas held true

92
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,980
on every continent
and for each and every one of us.

93
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,900
We're trying to establish
really core truths

94
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,500
which would apply
anywhere in the world,

95
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,580
and no-one is going to think
that findings

96
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,540
that are based on
a southern county in England

97
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,700
represent the globe,

98
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,380
and the only thing you can do to
offset that reasonable criticism

99
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,780
is to go out and do it.

100
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,220
In 1995, one of the key pieces
of evidence for the Barker theory

101
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,260
emerged from one of the most
crowded countries in the world.

102
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,180
By a quirk of fate, the people here

103
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,780
followed every piece of healthy
living advice you can think of.

104
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,180
According to conventional wisdom,
these Indian villagers

105
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,060
had made all the right choices
to lead a long and healthy life.

106
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,580
And yet they were
getting diseases

107
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,820
normally seen
in unhealthy, overweight people.

108
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,780
This was a real puzzle for us.

109
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,900
They are thin, they are eating the
vegetables they grow in their farms.

110
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,180
They walk long distances,
they work in the farms,

111
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,220
and that's the puzzle.

112
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,860
These people are anything
but overweight and obese.

113
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,940
Professor Ranjan Yajnik is a
world-renowned diabetes specialist.

114
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,420
And he's facing
a diabetes epidemic in India.

115
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,900
In the Western world,

116
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:46,260
type-2 diabetes is seen as
a disease of lifestyle.

117
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,460
It's associated with being
overweight,

118
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,020
a lack of exercise
and an unhealthy diet.

119
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,580
But Ranjan's patients
didn't fit that pattern.

120
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,300
The Western textbooks
I read as a medical student

121
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,940
told me that diabetic patients
were fat and overweight,

122
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,820
but you come to the clinic
in the rural hospital

123
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,820
and these are the people
who fill up our clinics.

124
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,940
They have a lot of diabetes
and heart disease.

125
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,700
The lifestyle of Ranjan's patients

126
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,060
should have given them
a long and healthy old age.

127
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,660
It couldn't explain why
so many of them

128
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,380
were falling victim
to type-2 diabetes.

129
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,740
But for one person, lifestyle
was clearly not the answer.

130
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,860
According to David Barker,
a low weight at birth

131
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,260
could be linked to
later health problems like diabetes.

132
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,580
BABY CRIES

133
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,180
And in India, there was no shortage
of low birth weight children.

134
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,460
Was the key to the disease
already there in these tiny babies?

135
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,020
Ranjan and his colleagues decided
to find out if the Barker theory

136
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,460
might explain what they were seeing.

137
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,220
Well, there was a lot of scepticism
at that stage

138
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,580
because we had learnt
as paediatricians at that time

139
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,620
that low birth weight is associated
with poverty and malnutrition,

140
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,940
whereas diabetes and hypertension
are diseases of affluence,

141
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,660
diseases of lifestyle.

142
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
So how were the two going together?

143
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,460
I was trained as
an adult diabetes specialist

144
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,500
and I was even more sceptical
of this idea

145
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,340
because we equated diabetes
with over-nutrition.

146
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,380
So David Barker was describing
the other end of the spectrum.

147
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,860
We do have a large number
of low birth weights

148
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,500
and we are having
a large number of diabetics.

149
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,540
So we are probably in a good
position to test his hypothesis,

150
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,660
so why not try it?

151
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,700
Ranjan and his colleagues
began to follow a group of babies

152
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,580
to see if their birth weight
could be linked to later diabetes.

153
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,100
Babies were measured
when they were born,

154
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,580
then at four years of age,
and again at eight years.

155
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,260
The scientists were looking for
early signs of diabetes -

156
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,260
for instance,
a resistance to insulin.

157
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,900
The first step was to show

158
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,180
that birth weight was related
to insulin resistance.

159
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,900
And we did tests by studying
200 children born in our hospital.

160
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,820
The children from that
original study are now 21.

161
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,540
The scientists have records of their
growth from the day they were born,

162
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,100
as well as a library of
blood samples.

163
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,260
It is these blood samples

164
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,700
that allowed the scientists to find
an early indicator of diabetes.

165
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,420
A low birth weight seemed to be
linked to a resistance to insulin.

166
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,580
So children whom we had found
to be low birth weight,

167
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,940
they are more insulin-resistant
at four years.

168
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,220
They were more insulin-resistant
at eight years,

169
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,500
and they are still insulin-resistant
at 21 years.

170
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,740
With passage of years, their
blood glucose has started rising.

171
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,420
There are other changes
we can observe in the blood

172
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,260
which tell us that their risk of
getting diabetes is now much higher

173
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,300
than their colleagues
who were not low birth weight.

174
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,620
Ranjan was beginning to be converted
to David Barker's

175
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,860
seemingly strange idea

176
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,380
that what happens to you in the womb
affects your destiny.

177
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,220
So David's idea that part of
your destiny

178
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,660
was sealed before you are born

179
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,300
was difficult to understand
for Westerners, but not for me.

180
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,180
As an Indian, I believed that
what happened in your earlier life,

181
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,060
what your parents did,

182
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,220
actually had a bearing on
what happens to you in your life.

183
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,300
This is the theory of karma.

184
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,620
This study was a crucial
piece of evidence

185
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,780
to support David Barker's theory.

186
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,980
But the real power of
the Barker theory

187
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,180
was that it didn't just apply to
very tiny babies.

188
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:18,900
The predictive power of birth weight
applies to us all.

189
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,500
What was surprising
about these early data

190
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,580
was that there was
a graded relationship

191
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,180
across a whole normal range
of birth weight,

192
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,860
so it was better to be
a seven-pound baby
than a six-pound baby,

193
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,900
and better to be an eight
than a seven and better to be
a nine than an eight-pound baby,

194
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,220
and that is profound.

195
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,860
What this suggested was that
there was an element of destiny

196
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,900
to the future health of
each and every one of us.

197
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,460
Look, look around you.

198
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:54,220
Clearly there are people
on very unhealthy lifestyles,

199
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,660
who live long lives
and have good constitutions,

200
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,420
and for them healthy lifestyles
may not matter so much.

201
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,580
But there are other people
who are highly vulnerable,

202
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,220
who have poor constitutions,

203
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,500
and for them the lifestyle
is the way forward.

204
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,900
That is what will protect them.

205
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,020
An idea that began in Hertfordshire
was starting to

206
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,820
reveal universal
truths about how our future health

207
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,420
was determined
before we were even born,

208
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,100
and what's true of health
may extend to our personality.

209
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,180
Oh, my goodness, for each of them?

210
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,020
I have two children and from day one
their personalities came out.

211
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:40,020
I have three children.
My oldest is very outgoing,

212
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,020
my middle child
is very wild and adventurous

213
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:49,820
and my youngest
is the easy-going, carefree child.

214
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,780
Only a fortune-teller

215
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,780
would attempt to predict
the person we will become

216
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,820
well before we were even born.

217
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,860
Before we could speak.

218
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,740
Before we'd even met our mother
face to face.

219
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,380
Yet many pregnant women
think they can.

220
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,820
I have one child

221
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,540
and she was just a diva
from before she was even born.

222
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,100
While they were in the womb,
they were very different.

223
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,940
This one's definitely
calm like my first,

224
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,940
but strong like my second.

225
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,140
Janet DiPietro is putting this
mother's intuition to the test.

226
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,180
She's a mother of three
and a developmental psychologist.

227
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,700
She wants to discover how much
of our future character is formed

228
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,180
before we've even
experienced the world.

229
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,220
Her work begins by trying to
give what is, in effect,

230
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,660
a personality test
to an unborn baby.

231
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,740
So in adults
and young people and children,

232
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,420
when we want to look at
individual differences,

233
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,500
what we often do is put them in
a new situation to see how they react

234
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,620
because how people react to things

235
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,020
is a big component
of what makes them unique.

236
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,820
To unpick the personality question,

237
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:19,260
Janet needed a way to test
the reactions of unborn babies.

238
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,460
She started by looking at
the way these tests

239
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,140
were conducted in children.

240
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,900
Some of the 900 babies
that have passed through her lab

241
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,940
are now five years old,
and they're back

242
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,700
to undergo more testing.

243
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,820
Right here.

244
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,980
It's just telling us
about how your body's working, OK?

245
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,220
The experiments put the children

246
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,940
in unusual situations
to see how they react.

247
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,460
Woof. Good.

248
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,540
Asking them to miaow
when they see a dog.

249
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,780
Or getting them to share with
adults, who start to behave

250
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,820
like greedy children.

251
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,020
..Give you one, and then
I'll take two.

252
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,460
One, two.

253
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,900
At five, differences in
personality begin to show

254
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,220
in the way children respond
to these unusual circumstances.

255
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,260
You can see it in their behaviour

256
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,060
and in their heart rates
and stress levels.

257
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,140
But I really like these candies,
so I'm going to take two. One, two.

258
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,460
I like them, too!

259
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,860
You do?

260
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,940
I'm going to give you one,
but I'll take four more.

261
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,100
No! You're taking all of it!
One, two, three, four.

262
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,180
'That little boy was almost
a little bit more intellectual.'

263
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,900
He was adamant when he had
his expectations about sharing...

264
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,100
broken, and so he said "no"
immediately,

265
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,660
'and then he sort of moved on
and he watched what was happening

266
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,820
'with the investigator,
but he was really more adamant.'

267
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,420
What do you think about that?

268
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,900
No.

269
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,020
'Whereas if we look at
the first little boy...'

270
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,180
What do you think about that,
if I take all of them?

271
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,060
..you can see that he
really feels what's going on,

272
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,740
so he'll experience that
very differently in his body, too.

273
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,060
I really like them,
but I think I'll get a stomach ache

274
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,620
if I eat them all.

275
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,740
Some of us react very emotionally
to changes in circumstances.

276
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,740
Our heart rates
and stress levels soar.

277
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,300
While others seem to have no trouble
keeping their body under control.

278
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,020
The characteristics
that distinguish all of us

279
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,380
are how we react to things

280
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,740
and then how we recover
after something happens.

281
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,540
Those are called the core features
of temperament.

282
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,140
We can see them in six-month-olds,
we can see them in five-year-olds,

283
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:04,020
and in adults
it's a more refined set of traits,

284
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,660
but the core is reactivity
and recovery irregulation.

285
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,740
Janet can even see
these core responses,

286
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,580
how extreme our reaction
to a new situation is
and how quickly we recover,

287
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,780
in the heart rate and stress levels
of six-month-olds.

288
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,820
If they were already there
at six months,

289
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,820
could these core personality traits

290
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,900
start even earlier,
back in the womb?

291
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,740
Janet's experiments allow her
to see how babies react to

292
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,180
a change in circumstances,
even before they're born.

293
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,900
First, she provokes strong emotions
in the pregnant mother

294
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,260
by showing her a video
about childbirth.

295
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,100
As the mother's heart rate
and stress levels change,

296
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,780
Janet watches
to see how the baby responds.

297
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:06,500
Or she can take a simpler approach,
and surprise the babies directly.

298
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,460
The mum is wearing the spa mask
and the headphones.

299
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,500
She's listening to music,
so she can't hear the stimulus,

300
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
but the foetus can.

301
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,340
OK, are you ready?

302
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,540
I'm ready.

303
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,140
All right. Go.

304
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,700
I could see her abdomen jump,
in fact.

305
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,580
You see a very quiet actograph and
then just that discrete little jump.

306
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,340
The foetus is startled at things,
just like babies.

307
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,140
Some babies, to that response,

308
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,180
startle so much that they wake up
and they continue to move.

309
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,260
Some babies
don't really react at all.

310
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,020
And then some babies,
like this one, moved.

311
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,060
Looks like they gave a very specific
response to it,

312
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,660
and then they
went back to their own business.

313
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,060
Even one month before birth,

314
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,340
Janet can begin to see distinctive
responses from the babies.

315
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,100
The core elements of
our future personality.

316
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,020
It feels great to me as a mom
to sort of validate moms everywhere,

317
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,940
that they didn't cause
their child to behave this way,

318
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,420
that their child
was already that way at birth.

319
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,420
But moms have to accept
the good and the bad, right?

320
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,860
So if your child turns out
a pleasant, happy child,

321
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,460
it's not... It's not your doing,

322
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,500
in the same way that
if your child turns out to be

323
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,860
a very difficult, unhappy child,
it's not your doing.

324
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,260
From the moment you're born,
parts of your future health,

325
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,900
happiness and personality
could already be determined.

326
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,220
But there may be a very simple
explanation for this.

327
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,580
It could all be down to the genes
we inherited from our parents.

328
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,340
David Barker needed to show
it was your nine months in the womb

329
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,140
and not just your genes
that made you...you.

330
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,420
Over ten years ago,

331
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,540
he began a collaboration
with Dutch scientists.

332
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,980
It was already clear that
in animals, manipulating

333
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,220
the environment in the womb altered
the health of future generations.

334
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,340
It would be impossible to experiment
on pregnant women in this way,

335
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,060
but sometimes history
creates an experiment for you.

336
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,620
Holland, 1944.

337
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,460
The Nazis were retreating and
leaving devastation in their wake.

338
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,660
All possible food
had been commandeered.

339
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,700
The result, a country-wide famine
which lasted five months.

340
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,340
Well, the Dutch famine occurred
when the Germans

341
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,060
banned all food transport,

342
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,020
and suddenly rations
dropped dramatically.

343
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,300
It was really
an acute period of famine

344
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,620
that struck an entire population.

345
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,700
Biologist Tessa Roseboom
saw an opportunity

346
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,140
to find out if our experience
in the womb

347
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,780
was every bit as important
as our genes.

348
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,540
There was hardly any food available

349
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,860
and we know from the records in
Amsterdam that people ate

350
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,500
two slices of bread, two potatoes

351
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,940
and half a sugarbeet
for the entire day.

352
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,260
So that's around 400 calories,

353
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,660
and we need about 2,000
to 2,500 a day.

354
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,180
Tessa began with the birth records
of one Amsterdam hospital.

355
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,860
After two years of
painstaking research,

356
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,100
she tracked down the people
who had been born in the famine.

357
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,580
We have birth records of
2,414 babies,

358
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:56,020
who were all born in this hospital
in Amsterdam.

359
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,500
We traced people and we interviewed
lots of people in their homes

360
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,140
and then invited them
to come to the clinic

361
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,820
for measurements,
and then do obviously a lot of
statistics behind the computer.

362
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,300
Tessa found that
whatever genes they carried,

363
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,700
those exposed to the famine in
the womb had more heart disease,

364
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,620
high blood pressure,
raised cholesterol,
diabetes and breast cancer.

365
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,380
And those who were conceived
after the famine...didn't.

366
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,980
We did indeed find
the brothers and sisters

367
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,220
of the people
who were exposed to famine.

368
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,060
They had the same genes from
the parents,

369
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,140
they had the same
post-natal environment, they grew up

370
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,140
in the same family, but the ones
who were exposed to the famine

371
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,060
while in the womb
were actually less healthy.

372
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,100
The later ill-health
was connected to the famine,

373
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,340
to what happened
to these people in the womb.

374
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,660
And the famine even had an effect

375
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,860
when it only lasted for
the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy.

376
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,980
Well, as a biologist,
it seems quite logical

377
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,580
that in the first 12 weeks
in which you lay down your brain,

378
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,820
your heart, your lungs, your
kidneys, all the essential organs,

379
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,060
if the quality of
the building blocks is poor

380
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,700
then the organs aren't as healthy,

381
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,980
or aren't as good as one would have
had with appropriate nutrition.

382
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,900
Because of the way our bodies grow,

383
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,220
the nine months that made you
will also have made your children.

384
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,700
At the time of the Dutch famine,
Tessa's grandmother was pregnant.

385
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,700
The egg that Tessa grew from
was already there,

386
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,260
created inside Tessa's mother's body

387
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,900
when she was an unborn baby
inside Tessa's grandmother.

388
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,420
So the egg that created Tessa

389
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,860
was also permanently altered
by the Dutch famine.

390
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,980
Well, genes can't be changed by
the food we eat,

391
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,420
but we know that food can
actually change whether genes

392
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,900
are switched on or off.

393
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,460
So famine may have affected
the switches on the genes in the egg

394
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,380
and therefore they may have affected

395
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,860
all the cells in the entire body of
the next generation as well.

396
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,260
So of the grandchildren

397
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,220
of women who were pregnant
at the time of the famine.

398
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,420
Tessa's work was powerful support
for the argument

399
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,100
that our life in the womb,
and not just our genes,

400
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,180
makes us more resilient
to future disease.

401
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,660
The picture that's emerging

402
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:59,620
is that your early development
sets up your constitution

403
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,540
and therefore sets up
how vulnerable you are

404
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,180
to negative things that you may
encounter through your life.

405
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:11,700
We've hitherto tried to answer that
question by assuming that

406
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,220
there must be genes which explain it,
but those genes have not come forward

407
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,140
and there isn't any particular reason
why they will.

408
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,220
Why would such genes exist?

409
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,900
The theory was that the quality of
nutrition you received in the womb

410
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,220
determined the quality of
your growth before birth.

411
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,780
This development
shapes your birth weight,

412
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,300
your life as a child
and your health to the present day.

413
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,020
But one question remained-

414
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,860
what exactly was happening
inside our bodies

415
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,460
in those crucial nine months
that could shape our destiny?

416
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,580
Back in India,

417
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,580
Professor Ranjan Yaznik was asking
himself the same question.

418
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,460
He had discovered
low birth weight babies

419
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,900
were more likely to end up
as diabetes patients in his clinic.

420
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,580
And the bad health went further.

421
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,460
At 21, some of them
were already showing signs of plaque

422
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,340
forming in their arteries,
an early indicator of heart disease.

423
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,780
Although these patients looked thin,

424
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,460
they were getting diseases normally
seen in overweight and obese people.

425
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,020
There was something
strange going on.

426
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,780
Why were these apparently
thin people's bodies

427
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,140
behaving as if they were fat?

428
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,500
To find out,
Ranjan did another study
to measure the amount of body fat

429
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,340
these low birth weight babies
were carrying.

430
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,300
The babies here
were born at 2.7 kilograms,

431
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,580
but when we measured their body fat
with special techniques,

432
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,580
we realised that they have body fat

433
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,300
which is as high
as that of an English baby,

434
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,900
a baby weighing 3.5 kg.

435
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,140
Almost 800 grams heavier.

436
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,580
They appear very thin,
but they are fat.

437
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,860
We found the same thing
at four years.

438
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,700
They were thin and fat.
At eight years again,

439
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,740
they were thin and fat, and at 21
years they're again thin and fat.

440
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,460
From birth,

441
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,620
it was as if these people's bodies
had the wrong settings.

442
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,220
People with low birth weights
looked thin, but they were actually

443
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,860
carrying the same amount of fat
as someone much heavier than them.

444
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,820
Ranjan thought he, too, might have
this unusual body composition

445
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,220
as he was also
a low birth weight baby.

446
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,340
I was born less than five pounds
and I thought we could investigate

447
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,980
to find out whether I was
at the higher risk of diabetes.

448
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,860
So I did this by actually
studying myself and my friend.

449
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,380
We have both
same body mass index, 22.3,

450
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,420
but John has 9% body fat

451
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,340
and I have 21% body fat.

452
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,540
The same body mass index,

453
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,420
an Indian has more than twice
the amount of fat

454
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,140
that an Englishman has.

455
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,420
This is a perfect example
of a thin/fat Indian.

456
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,100
Ranjan decided to see
if the mother's diet in pregnancy

457
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,820
could be causing these
thin/fat bodies to develop.

458
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,860
He looked at every aspect
of the diet...

459
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,580
and strangely he found
it wasn't all about calories.

460
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,860
To our great surprise,
it was not the mother's calorie

461
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:36,500
and the protein and the fat intake
which predicted the foetal growth.

462
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,540
It was the...

463
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:43,380
eating of the micro-nutrient
rich foods.

464
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,460
It was how much green vegetables,
the fruits and the milk

465
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:50,740
which decided the size of the baby
and how that baby was built.

466
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,020
Ranjan's work showed that it
wasn't the quantity of food
we received in the womb,

467
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,180
but getting the right vitamins
and minerals which was crucial.

468
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,140
Mothers who had low B-12
and high foliate

469
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,380
gave birth to thin/fat babies

470
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,620
which were insulin resistant
as children

471
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:15,500
and they seemed to be at higher risk
of getting diabetes in future.

472
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,740
These small variations in diet

473
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:33,020
suggested that even quite ordinary
changes in life before birth

474
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,820
can have noticeable effects
on our future health.

475
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,700
The picture we now have is that
normal human development is fragile.

476
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:50,020
That very often there is insufficient
resource available to the baby

477
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,660
to perfect every bit of its body.

478
00:34:54,900 --> 00:35:00,060
The body has repair mechanisms
for mending broken bits.

479
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,580
The body has a store
of stem cells of varying quality.

480
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:10,060
The body has immune defences,
it has defences against oxygen,

481
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,220
and the quality of these systems

482
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,460
determines the quality of health
through life

483
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,500
because health is
essentially about the body's ability

484
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,060
to maintain equilibrium
in the face of challenges.

485
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,540
If our future health was determined
by the quality of our growth

486
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:35,340
in the womb, David Barker
saw an intriguing possibility -

487
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:39,780
the chance to intervene and prevent
all these diseases of later life.

488
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:46,820
It was becoming clear to him that if
you wanted a healthy happy old age,

489
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:52,380
the nine months you spent
in the womb could be the most
important nine months of your life.

490
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,100
Cheese!

491
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,740
Scientists are discovering
it's not just the food that
reaches us in the womb,

492
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:12,300
but also the hormones we're exposed
to that could powerfully
affect how our life unfolds.

493
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,660
These monkeys could hold clues
that our behaviour is not all down
to the way we were brought up.

494
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,540
According to Professor Melissa
Hines of Cambridge University,

495
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:33,020
testosterone levels in the womb
could have changed the way we think.

496
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,700
The reason people have gotten
interested in testosterone levels

497
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,380
in human beings is because there's
thousands of studies in other species

498
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,620
that show that if you manipulate
testosterone experimentally

499
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:52,460
during development, it influences
the way the brain develops

500
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,780
and as a consequence of that,
the individual's behaviour

501
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,220
across the lifespan
in respect of behaviours
that differ for males and females.

502
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:17,180
Melissa has found the same effects
of testosterone in the womb
in both monkeys and children.

503
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,380
Female humans,
and other primates, tend
to play with this sort of toy...

504
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,300
Baby.

505
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,580
..while the males, whether
monkey or man, go for another kind.

506
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,060
My favourite is the fire engine.

507
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:42,100
But the female monkeys, and the
girls, with higher testosterone
levels in the womb

508
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,820
end up acting more like the males

509
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,660
and ditch the dolls for the trucks.

510
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,060
More testosterone exposure
makes your behaviour more male.

511
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,820
So in two recent studies,
we've looked at normal variability.

512
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,420
In the first instance
by measuring maternal
testosterone during pregnancy

513
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:09,300
and in the second instance by looking
at testosterone and amniotic fluid.

514
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,660
In both cases we find that
the more testosterone the individual

515
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:19,140
was exposed to pre-natally,
the more male-typical their childhood
behaviour is.

516
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,060
So can you see this shape?

517
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,620
I think...

518
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,220
it might be that one. Yeah.

519
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,820
Other skills could be linked
to testosterone levels in the womb,
from reading emotions

520
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,900
to reading a map,

521
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,780
or spotting hidden triangles
in complex shapes. Well done!

522
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:43,420
Could the level of testosterone
in the womb be changing our brains,
affecting our abilities?

523
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,700
It's a question another group
of Cambridge scientists are studying

524
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,580
by looking at the brains of
eight-year-olds in an MRI scanner.

525
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,580
So this is the human brain

526
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,900
and this white section that you see
here is called the corpus closum.

527
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,940
It's a fibrotract that
connects the right hemisphere
to the left hemisphere.

528
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,460
One part of this region
of the children's brains varied,

529
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,460
depending on the levels
of testosterone in the womb.

530
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,380
So what we found is that low
testosterone actually meant that

531
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,620
this part of the closum was bigger on
the left side than on the right side.

532
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,180
This is one of the first times
physical differences

533
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,460
in our brain have been directly
linked to testosterone levels
in the womb.

534
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,820
So we can really ask the question,
is foetal testosterone a mechanism

535
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:44,140
that sort of pushes brains
to being more male or more female?

536
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,260
This work with testosterone
suggests hormones can have

537
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:54,020
a crucial impact during
the nine months that made you.

538
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,700
And because they affect our brain,

539
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,900
they may affect all aspects
of our personality.

540
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,540
CALL TO PRAYER

541
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:25,380
By 2011, David Barker
had been working on his theory
for over two decades.

542
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,980
He had evidence that the way
we grew in the womb could have
lasting effects on our health.

543
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,980
But now, he wanted to not
just understand our destiny,

544
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,700
but potentially re-write it.

545
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,900
I'm here because
there are potentially important

546
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,340
medical records
here in the desert of Saudi Arabia.

547
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,740
Records like these
are the key to David's work.

548
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:16,140
He's always looking
for places where human experience
creates a natural experiment.

549
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,780
David is working
with Saudi scientists

550
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,380
to connect these records
to real people living in the town
of Unizah today.

551
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,060
We have three different types
of records

552
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,340
that we can get a nice idea
of the babies and how they grew up,

553
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,140
what problems they faced,

554
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:47,260
how this can be linked
to the life in utero and so on.

555
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,900
We have found records in China,
we have found records in India.

556
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,940
There are records
in different European countries.

557
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,860
Some records in America.

558
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,060
Nothing like the records here,

559
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,780
so this is very exciting.

560
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:11,140
This latest set of records
could reveal a crucial
piece of the puzzle.

561
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,860
They contain the details
of an overlooked companion

562
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:21,180
that shared our nine months
in the mysterious world of the womb.

563
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,220
We all began life
in a world of water...

564
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,820
..bathed in warm fluid,

565
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,980
surrounded by the muted
sounds of the outside world
and our mother's heartbeat.

566
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,860
Graham Burton of Cambridge
University has been investigating

567
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,220
life in this strange world
his entire career.

568
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,820
This is really where it all began.

569
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,460
There's general agreement
that when life evolved on the
planet, it did so in the seas.

570
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,380
And even today, we recreate this
watery environment within the womb.

571
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,340
The baby develops within a sac of
salty fluid, very similar to the sea.

572
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,260
It's not until the waters break at
the time of delivery that we learn

573
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,820
to take our first breath of air.

574
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,420
Graham knew our mysterious
companion in the womb

575
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,060
would be crucial
to David Barker's work.

576
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,140
So when David first
presented his theory,

577
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:54,380
I thought this was extremely
interesting, but my first reaction

578
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,460
was of course,
"Well, what about the placenta?"

579
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,900
Because everything that goes
between the mother and the baby

580
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,740
must pass through the placenta.

581
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,220
Your placenta was created during
the same nine months that made you.

582
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,340
It is the link between
a baby, its mother

583
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,380
and the outside world.

584
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:22,100
Within the placenta there are
these finger-like processes,

585
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,100
rather like the fronds
of the seaweed.

586
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,020
Mother's blood comes in
through the arteries

587
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:33,620
into this space within the placenta

588
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,660
and passes between
these frond-like processes,

589
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,700
bringing oxygen
and nutrients to the placenta.

590
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,220
Everything that reached us
in the womb

591
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,620
passed through
this extraordinary organ.

592
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,620
Of course, none of us would be
here today without our placentas.

593
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:55,340
It's really an extension of us.
It shares the same DNA

594
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:59,700
and in some cultures,
it's almost considered a twin.

595
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:07,260
To really understand how
we developed in the womb, we need
to unravel the role of our placenta.

596
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,020
It acts as a selective barrier,

597
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,980
designed to both feed
and protect the baby.

598
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,740
And Graham has discovered
key evidence of exactly
how this happens.

599
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,500
So for example,
in placentas where the mother
has smoked during pregnancy,

600
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:34,380
what we see is a reduction
in the size of the blood vessels
within the placenta

601
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:39,020
and a thickening
of the barrier separating the
mother's and the baby's blood.

602
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:43,420
So both of those effects will
impair the transfer of nutrients

603
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,340
from the mother to the baby

604
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:50,580
and that may account for why the baby
is smaller in women who smoke.

605
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,860
This is just one example
of the many things which can affect

606
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,740
this delicate and responsive organ.

607
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:07,060
Graham's work shows just how
important the placenta is during
the nine months that made you.

608
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:15,260
Every placenta is different and in
a way every placenta tells a story,

609
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,820
and if we can read
the clues within the placenta,

610
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:23,140
then in a way we have a record of
how the placenta and the baby develop

611
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,140
and that may help us in predicting
the future health of the baby.

612
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:41,500
It's because our placenta
has such a powerful influence
on how our lives unfold

613
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,740
that David Barker
has come to Saudi Arabia.

614
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,740
He has recently begun work
with Dr Saleh Al-Wasel

615
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,740
of King Saud University in Riyadh.

616
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,860
They're in the early stages of
an important new research project.

617
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,780
Hidden in the records
of the Saudi town of Unizah,

618
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,700
Dr Al-Wasel has already
found evidence of how the placenta

619
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,260
may protect the baby
from changes in our mother's diet.

620
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,180
He's discovered the placenta
seems to respond to Ramadan.

621
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,060
Ramadan is a month that
most people here in Saudi Arabia

622
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,460
change their lifestyle.

623
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,980
The frequency of food, the amount of
food and also the quality of food.

624
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:44,140
If Ramadan occurred during later
pregnancy, Saleh found the placentas
were smaller than usual.

625
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,420
The placenta is not a solid organ.

626
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,020
It's a very plastic organ.

627
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:55,060
It's very sensitive
to the environment

628
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,340
and responds quickly to changes.

629
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,780
I mean, in Ramadan,

630
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,860
it's just only one month
among nine months of the pregnancy

631
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,900
and you can see changes
in the placenta.

632
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,180
Just for one month,
changes in the size.

633
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:16,500
You would think a smaller placenta
would mean a smaller baby,

634
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,100
but intriguingly the size
of the babies didn't change.

635
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,420
It seemed the smaller placenta
was capable

636
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,500
of transferring the same amount
of nutrients as a larger one would,

637
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,180
that it was protecting the baby from
any effects of the dietary change.

638
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:40,380
Here is the baby weight.
2.8, 3.4, 3.2,

639
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,180
3.3, 3.3, 3.4...

640
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,460
These birth records suggest

641
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,580
that even though
the Saudi placenta is always
smaller than a Western one,

642
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,380
it's capable of producing
as large a baby.

643
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,540
Well, it's absolutely clear
looking down this column,

644
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,780
and I've looked
at hundreds of such columns,

645
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,220
that these babies
are of Western size,

646
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,820
but the placentas are much smaller.

647
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:17,580
The Saudi babies are growing
large and healthy from
these smaller placentas.

648
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,020
It's as if they're working
more efficiently.

649
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,780
To understand why, Saleh is now
working with a hospital in Riyadh.

650
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,540
They are measuring newborn
babies and then analysing
their placentas in the lab.

651
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,460
It's 30 cms.

652
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:50,900
They hope to discover
why some placentas are better at
transferring nutrients than others.

653
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:59,460
The interesting thing about this is
that the placenta does not transport

654
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,860
nutrients in the same manner
all day, all stages.

655
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,500
It fluctuates.

656
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,660
So by looking inside the placenta,
we would hope to investigate

657
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:16,260
how this placenta takes the
nutrients from the mother's side

658
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,700
and delivers it to the baby's side.

659
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:26,020
Our companion in the womb
is now being given as much respect

660
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,300
by Western science as it has
always had in Saudi culture.

661
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,700
You cannot separate culture
from science

662
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,180
and here, for example,
in Saudi Arabia,

663
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,420
toward the end of the pregnancy,

664
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:44,500
we look at the placenta as if it
is going to die to bring a live baby

665
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,980
and for this,
we respect this unique organ

666
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:52,260
and handle it carefully
and bury it in the graveyard.

667
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:05,020
So I'm very excited that the
placenta is beginning to get the
recognition that it deserves.

668
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,940
David's work has really highlighted
the importance of the intra-uterine

669
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:15,220
period for adult health and, of
course, the placenta is critical to
that, and it's very rewarding to see

670
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:20,060
that a number of young investigators
are turning their attention
to the placenta

671
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,500
and I think in the next five,
ten years

672
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,980
we're really going to gain a much
greater insight into its function.

673
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,580
If we can understand
why some placentas seem
to work better than others,

674
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:38,540
it might be possible to ensure every
baby gets the best start in life,

675
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,980
thanks to a really
efficient placenta.

676
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:01,340
In the tough environment
of the slums of Mumbai,

677
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,500
David Barker is hoping
his ideas can change lives.

678
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,900
The underlying mechanisms
which affect the quality

679
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:20,100
of our growth in the womb
are still under investigation,

680
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:24,660
but David believes we already know
enough to alter the health destiny
of future generations.

681
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,020
It is a new way, it is a feasible way

682
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,420
and it's not even
a very expensive way,

683
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,780
so it's time we got going.

684
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,500
Inspired by David's ideas, his
colleague, Professor Caroline Fall,

685
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:47,540
is leading a study
with the potential to fix
the diabetes epidemic in India.

686
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,700
At the moment, if you talk
about preventing diabetes,

687
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,140
people are talking about making
middle-aged people lose weight,

688
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,220
and A, that's impossible to do,

689
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,300
and B, it doesn't seem
to work very well anyway.

690
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,460
The idea that you could
build a human being that was

691
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,820
more resistant to this disease
was amazing to me.

692
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,460
Caroline's plan to halt
the diabetes epidemic

693
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,500
doesn't rely on high-tech labs
or fancy science.

694
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,380
It rests mainly on these women

695
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,980
and one kitchen.

696
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:36,940
These recipes contain all the
crucial building blocks needed to
build a body resistant to disease.

697
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:41,980
'Folic acid, calcium, iron,
vitamin A.'

698
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:45,300
The calcium will be important
for bone growth.

699
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,140
The green leafy vegetables
contain small quantities

700
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,580
of essential fatty acids which
are important for brain growth.

701
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,340
All of those nutrients are important
in different tissues of the body.

702
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:03,180
The foetus, at a very,
very early microscopic stage,

703
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:07,100
is sensitive to the nutrients
around it and if we miss that,

704
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,500
we feel that we would be missing the
most important stage of development.

705
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:29,900
Every day, over 1,500 snacks
are made in this kitchen.

706
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:35,060
There are nutrient-rich recipes and
others that are green vegetable-free

707
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,860
to act as scientific controls.

708
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:44,300
They are taken to about 50 clinics
in the slums across the city.

709
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:54,500
In total, over 6,700 women
have participated

710
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,220
and each must begin
eating the supplements
well before they fall pregnant.

711
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:03,700
It's a logistical nightmare
where the utmost care must be taken

712
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,780
to be scientific.

713
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,860
I'm very glad to have met Meera.

714
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,260
It's been hard work, it's been hard
work setting up a study like this.

715
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,740
To carry it out on the ground

716
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:21,420
in a population like this
is very difficult.

717
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,860
It's mandatory for a woman
to come to the centre

718
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,820
and have the supplement
in front of the project clerk

719
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:32,020
because it is very important, you
know, because if they take it home,

720
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,380
somebody else can eat it.

721
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,620
They can throw it out
or the child can eat it.

722
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:39,500
We are not sure
who the supplement has gone into,

723
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,820
whose stomach, so it's very
important to have women
coming to the centre.

724
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,420
The centre is full of women
eating supplements

725
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,620
from well before pregnancy
until they give birth.

726
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:58,540
And there are also babies
who must be measured at one,
three, six and 12 months.

727
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,020
Their weight, length
and body fat are recorded,

728
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,060
and they are even testing
their mental development.

729
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,380
It is an ambitious
long-term project.

730
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,820
For seven-and-a-half years.
How many more?

731
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,860
Forever, I think. So nice!

732
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:27,340
The results of this study
will begin to come in next year.

733
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,980
We're providing better
nutrition into the mother,

734
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,260
but the mother herself
has had a poor early development,

735
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,180
which may affect
the quality of her eggs.

736
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,980
It certainly affects
the size of her uterus

737
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,860
and the quality of the blood supply
to the uterus.

738
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:49,300
So she is still constraining
the development and growth

739
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,580
of that foetus, even if we are
providing enough building blocks

740
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,860
to develop a better foetus.

741
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,380
We need to follow these children
through and we need to follow

742
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,140
into the next generation
to see the full benefit.

743
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:21,620
David Barker's ideas have
transformed the way we think
about our time in the womb.

744
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:27,340
If the work in India is successful,
the study of foetal origins

745
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:32,140
that began in Hertfordshire
could alter the health of future
generations across the world.

746
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:40,100
Many people have looked
at genes, but it hasn't been
as promising as we thought

747
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,580
and it's been very difficult
to change lifestyles,

748
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:46,380
to prevent heart disease,
for instance, but I think
this field of research

749
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:51,380
that focuses on development during
pregnancy is really very promising.

750
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:00,860
The benefits of improving
the nutrition of the human embryo

751
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:06,700
and foetus are not just
reducing the burden of diabetes.

752
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:10,140
It will reduce the burden
of cardiovascular disease,

753

00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:28,900

in terms of our long-term health.
