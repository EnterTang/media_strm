走开 这是我的地方
Go away.
This is my turf!

144
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,644
你的地方 这是什么 “西线故事”么
Your turf?
What is this,<i>West Side Story?</i>

145
00:05:57,678 --> 00:06:01,382
你不能占一整个车厢 这是公共财产
You can't own a whole train car.
It's public property.

146
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,083
我在这车厢睡了六年了
Sleeping in this car six years.
 
147
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:04,885
在这拉 在这吐 在这打飞机
Pissed, puked, jizzed in it.

148
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,354
根据体液法规 这就是我的地方
By law of bodily fluids,
it's mine.


150
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:09,890
反正我不走

停下
Stop it!

152
00:06:15,364 --> 00:06:16,731
你这个糟糕的流浪汉
You're a terrible
homeless person.

153

我不是流浪汉 我有家

154
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:19,934
那昨晚你怎么不回去睡
Then why didn't you
go there last night?

155
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:22,436
我正要回去
I was on my way there

156
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:25,239
不过坐下后我不小心睡着了
when I sat down here
and accidentally fell asleep.

157
00:06:25,274 --> 00:06:27,942
扯淡 你看着就像个乞丐 闻着也像个乞丐
Bullshit. You look like a bum,
you smell like a bum.

158
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:29,276

194
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:57,464

等 等 等 等一下
Wait, wait, wait,

00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,844
开车撞了你的前女友
ran over your ex-girlfriend

I don't know. I don't know
what she's capable of.

264

慢慢地
Very slowly.

268
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:36,791
你要让她觉得是自己的主意
You need to make her think
it's her idea.

269
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:38,192
一定要保持距离
Keep your distance.

270
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:40,528
因为一旦她们觉得自己被甩了
Because once they get
behind the wheel,

271
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:42,697
那你就没有退路了

276
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:51,773
是啊 我告诉她的
Yeah.

277
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:53,475

- Lip, you can't
tell her that shit!

278
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,143

你做什么都不要说 Lip
And whatever you do, do not-- Lip.

282
00:11:02,651 --> 00:11:04,719
不要让她怀上你的孩子
Do not let her bone you,

283
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:07,856
她们就是因为有了孩子才疯了的
because that oxytocin stuff makes them adhesive.

284
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,025
明白吗
You got it?

285
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:11,259
恩
Yeah.

286
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,630
我没打算和你说话
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

287
00:11:16,665 --> 00:11:18,532
-Fiona和Lip会疯了的  -他们当然会
-Fiona and Lip will be mad. -Well, of course they will.

288
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:20,867
他们看我像是疯子 因为我是个坏爸爸
They treat me like a leper because I'm "a bad father."

289
00:11:20,902 --> 00:11:22,369
没错
Yeah, right.

290
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:24,404
你根本没见过坏的父母
Tell you, you haven't seen bad parenting

291
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,807
你还没见过我老妈的光辉岁月呢
till you witness my mother in her glory days.

292
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:29,175
她有个惩罚之棍
Had this piece of wood she called a retribution stick.

293
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,978
一边是平的 一边是尖的
Flat side, skinny side.

294
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:34,180
如果我犯了小毛病 比如偷饼干
If I did something small, like steal an extra cookie

295
00:11:34,214 --> 00:11:36,849
往她的浴缸里尿尿 她就用平的那头揍我
or piss in her shampoo bottle--whack. Flat side.

296
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:38,585
如果我犯了大事儿
But if I did something heinous,

297
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:40,487
在她睡觉的时候在床上点火
like set fire to her bed when she was napping,

298
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:42,923
或者让他在车库的赌博会上丢面子
or rat her out for her garage gambling ring,

299
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:44,424
她就会用尖的那头揍我了
the skinny side.

300
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,527
和抽鞭子一样
Like a whip.

303
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:51,532
但我没在她无家可归的时候
Whack! But did I throw that bitch

304
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:53,567
把她扔进臭水沟里 对吧
into the gutter when she needed a home? No.

305
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:56,536
我给她洗头 帮她洗松弛的奶子
I brushed her hair. I washed her saggy tits.

306
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,338
给他清理溃疡
I irrigated her ulcers.

307
00:11:58,372 --> 00:12:00,240
我照料着他 直到他死
I nursed her all the way to the grave.

308
00:12:00,274 --> 00:12:04,243
但你们却在我这么惨的时候无家可归
But you people, making me homeless in the dead of autumn?

309
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:06,779
我还帮你熬过了癌症 不是吗
After I got you through cancer?

310
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:09,248
昨天晚上 我在火车上睡的
I slept on a train last night!

311
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:10,849
很帅啊 我能试试吗
Cool. Can I try that?

312
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:14,020
那是种煎熬 我没地方去了
No! It's barbaric. I have no place to go!

313
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:17,290
你明白吗
Do you get it?

314
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:19,792
我可以让你溜进卡车里睡
I could sneak you in the van tonight.

315
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:24,397
你帮我
You'd do that for me?

316
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:26,866
你个胆小鬼
You little piker, you.

317
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,893
你来了
You made it.

318
00:12:52,928 --> 00:12:57,431
椅子在那边  小心那些东西
Chairs are over here, and watch out for splinters.

319
00:12:57,465 --> 00:13:00,434
Lip仍然还在和Karen鬼混
You know,,Lip is still up Karen's ass.

320
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:02,936
他还挺念旧的
It's getting old.

321
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:04,438
恩
Yeah.

322
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:08,675
Svetlana 她是个
So, Svetlana. She like, uh--

323
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,177
她不怎么爱说话
She's quiet.

324
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:11,646
很瘦 这个很奇怪
And skinny, which is weird,

325
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,347
因为她经常被大鸡吧操
'cause he usually bags fat chicks.

326
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:16,250
我为他洗衣
I do his laundry.

327
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:18,853
我帮他申请 Karen为他做了什么
I apply to colleges for him, and what the hell does Karen do?

328
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:22,823
除了会胡说八道 快他妈算了吧
Drools and farts. I mean, come on.

329
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:23,925
他喜欢她吗
Think he loves her?

330
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,259
她脑瘫了
She's brain-dead.

331
00:13:25,294 --> 00:13:27,528
- 我说Mickey  - 我不清楚
- I mean Mickey. - I dunno.

332
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:29,664
无数人操过她
Tons of guys get chicks knocked up

333
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:31,866
但都没打算负责任
and don't get hitched, so...

334
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,035
老爸特别高兴这事  他计划的这些
Dad's super excited. Planned the whole thing.

335
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:37,038
他还从他的枪支俱乐部叫了些伙计
Invited his buds from the gun club.

336
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:41,676
有点意思
It's kind of sweet.

339
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,286
看看  这些是我工作时候偷的
Hey, look what I stole from work.

340
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:54,455
3杯卡布奇诺
Three cheers for Captain Cappuccino.

341
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:56,190
没拿点奶油什么的
Take some cream with that hostility?

342
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:58,293
没 这就不错了了  我刚刚告诉我最好的朋友
Oh, no, it's fine, just whisk my best friend off

343
00:13:58,327 --> 00:13:59,994
我们想要个孩子的事  没什么大事
when I'm about to have a baby,no biggie.

344
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:01,296
你还告诉别人了吗
Whoa, we're telling people already?

345
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,164
不是别人 只有V
Not "people." Just V.

346
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:05,533
我老板Mike打算提拔我
And Mike from work, who says he'll look into transferring me.

347
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,368
别把你的裤子弄湿饿了  暗指 潜规则
Oh, don't get your panties in a wad.

348
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:09,170
我可不是大嘴巴
I know how to keep my mouth shut.

349
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:10,805
我真的很替你高兴  我只是觉得我有点惨
Look, I'm happy for you. I'm just sad for me.

350
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,506
不用担心
Oh... don't worry,

351
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,709
我们会每个月都回来看你的孩子的
we'll come visit your li'l peanut once a month.

352
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:17,477
或者你们可以和我呆一起

我很喜欢去 可那全是小虫子
Love camping in theory, except for the bugs,

369
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:49,676
还得在脏了吧唧的地上睡觉

she just can't form
any new ones.

443
00:18:09,314 --> 00:18:10,548
我从医院拿了点书
Got some pamphlets
from the hospital.

444
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,549
好的 谢了
Yeah, thanks.

445
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:14,786
她什么时候会好呢
Um, when's it go away?

446
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:16,421
每个人的情况都不一样 你知道的
Everyone's different, you know?

447
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:18,557
可能是永远这样了 可我觉得还是有希望的
Could be permanent,
but I say we keep hope alive.

448
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:20,893
我Sedona有个家
I got family down in Sedona.

449
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:22,327
他们在那治这种病
They have
healing vortexes out there.

450
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:23,328
选择性的治疗和恢复
Alternative treatments
and stuff.

451
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:24,730
她才回家
Oh, she just got home.

452
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:27,432
我们只是不知道 她想要什么而已
We don't know
what she needs yet.

453
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:29,968
她现在看起来好多了
She seems nicer though.



434
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,641
你把你电话落家里了
You left your phone at home.

435
00:18:35,676 --> 00:18:37,109
你不用专门拿过来给我的
You didn't have to come down
here to bring it to me.

436
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:38,577
- 你有个怪怪的电话  - 谁打来的
- You got a weird phone call.
- From who?

437
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:40,012
一个租房子的女的打来的
Some lady from a--
from a rental place.

438
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:41,847
她说你的信用卡被核对成功了
She said your credit's
been approved.

439
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:44,583
你可以随时去签你要租的工作室的合同了
You can sign your contract on
your studio whenever you want.

440
00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:47,620
看起来是我们都住在一起有点太挤了
Seems like a tight squeeze.
I mean, all of us in one room.

441
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:50,789
我是在我们讨论这事之前填的租屋意向
I filled out that application
form before we talked.

442
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:52,491
大学里基本上什么也没有
There was hardly anything
available on campus,

443
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:53,793
而且那个房子看着也不错
and it seemed like
a good opportunity.

444
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:55,194
所以你向银行借钱了
So you put a deposit down.

445
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:56,195
他们检查我的信用额度是理所当然的
I had to for them
to run the credit check.

446
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,764
你贷款就是为了租个工作室
On a studio apartment.

447
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,632
好吧 我承认这事我没考虑好
Okay, I guess I didn't
think it through.

448
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,601
你说什么  你已经准备要回去上课了吗
What, have you signed up
for classes already?

449
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:03,035
我基本上算是入学了吧  可也没全完事
Technically, I'm enrolled,
but it's complicated

450
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,472
- 因为我还在拖着 
- 'cause of my deferral.


451
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:09,676
我觉得你应该休息一下了
Now might be a good time
for a little break-o.

452
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,511
所以 你就已经要这么去了呗
So, you're going,
just like that?

453
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:12,946
我说了  还没确定呢
Like I said, nothing's final.

454
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,380
可你说了  你没想带我们走
But you had
no plans to bring us.

455
00:19:14,415 --> 00:19:15,381
你一直在偷偷摸摸的背着我们干这事
You've been slowly
backing away all along.

456
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,050
你好好想想吧
Think about it.

457
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:18,785
我自己一个人过去
Isn't it so much easier
if I get a place over there

458
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:20,453
周末再回来陪你们 是不是简单多了
and come home on the weekends?

459
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:22,554
我是想  为什么要全家都过去呢
I mean, why uproot
the entire family?

460
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:26,224
- 我真不敢相信你说出这样的话  - 不过就是4个小时的火车
- I can't even believe this.
- It's a four-hour train ride!

461
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:28,293
那可是他妈的整整一年啊
For one year,
it's totally doable!

462
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:31,062
你没问我的意见 就做了主
You made the decision
without me,

463
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:33,231
就好像这事对我们一点影响都没有一样
as if it has
absolutely no effect on us.

464
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:35,466
好吧 你决定要这帮孩子的监护权的时候
Okay, and how is that
any different from what you did

465
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,468
不也是这样吗
when you decided to become
legal guardian of those kids?

466
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:40,037
你压根就没想过我的想法
You never once considered
how I'd be affected.

467
00:19:40,071 --> 00:19:42,573
- 那帮孩子是我的命 - 他妈的不是这回事 Fiona
- Those kids are my life.
- No shit, Fiona.

468
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:44,908
你只要问我一下  我也会告诉你 我支持你
And maybe if you would've
asked me, I woulda said, "yes.

469
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:46,376
我们一起养活这帮孩子吧  可你压根就没问我
Let's do this together."
But you didn't.

470
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:48,378
你压根都没他妈的想问我
It didn't even
occur to you to ask me.

471
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:49,847
不是  从你认识我那天
No, you have known from day one

472
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,582
你就应该了解我是什么样的人
what you were
getting into with me.

473
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:52,683
好吧  是我他妈的走进了你的生活
Right, I got sucked
into your world.

474
00:19:52,717 --> 00:19:54,218
我按照你的要求做
I bent to your rules.

475
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:55,653
我只是想我们能
I just assumed
that we'd eventually decide

476
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:57,889
像一般的情侣一样决定一些事
how to move forward together
like couples do,

477
00:19:57,923 --> 00:19:59,757
可你压根就没想过我
but there never was "we!"

478
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,492
我一直以来都干了那么多
What have I been doing?

479
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:05,330
做饭 打扫屋子 洗衣服 住在他妈的一个贫民窟里
Cooking, cleaning, laundry,
living in a goddamn slum!

480
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:13,237
贫民窟
A slum?



503
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:15,539
你曾经让我感觉是一个可以依靠的人
You made me feel like I could depend on you,

504
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:17,407
-现在我的家成了贫民窟  -难道不是吗
- and now it's a slum? - Isn't it?

505
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:21,011
一个12岁的小姑娘用枪指着我抢走了我的钱 Fiona
I got robbed at gunpoint by a 12-year-old girl, Fiona!

506
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:23,080
那你为什么不他妈找个别的地方去住呢
Why don't you go find another fuckin' place to sleep!

507
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:26,383
比如一个工作室
A fucking studio!

509
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:54,478
啊 陈年老烟卷和臭鼬的尿味儿
Ahh. Old cigarettes and skunk piss.

510
00:20:58,086 --> 00:20:59,104
给
Here.

511
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:05,056
-只剩这点边儿  -我们就只有这些了
- Just crusts? - That's all they had.

512
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,992
那么 早饭有着落吗
Well, what about breakfast?

513
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:10,395
儿啊
Son...

514
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:12,063
我希望你永远不要知道
I hope you never have to know

515
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:14,633
无家可归的滋味
what it's like to not have a home.

516
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,635
他们放下这件事的 最起码Fiona会
They'll get over it. At least Fiona will.

517
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,970
我可不抱什么指望了
I wouldn't count on it.

518
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:19,805
这坏脾气的小娘们怀恨在心
That ornery bitch can hold a grudge.

519
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,176
人就是这么操蛋 这就是生活
People fuck up. That's life.

520
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,078
家人应该是永远的
Family is supposed to be forever.

521
00:21:26,113 --> 00:21:29,081
不管你做了什么 都该关心你
Supposed to take care of you regardless of what you do.

522
00:21:29,116 --> 00:21:32,852
这才是重点 否则何必呢
That's the whole point, otherwise why bother?

523
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:35,355
该死
Christ!


524
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:40,127
这有虫子
There are vermin in here!

525
00:21:42,964 --> 00:21:44,499
我是你的家人
I'm your family.

526
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:48,803
你是对的 儿子 你从不会抛下我
You're right, son. You haven't let me down.

527
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:52,140
我在你这个年纪的时候
When I was your age,

528
00:21:52,174 --> 00:21:54,275
我爸爸带我第一次去抢劫
my papa took me on my first heist.

529
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,113
我们搞到一台hi-fi音响，大概值600块
We scored a hi-fi stereo, about 600 bucks.

530
00:21:58,147 --> 00:21:59,647
我们在酒店订了间房
Booked a hotel,

531
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:02,283
点了所有的客房服务还看了付费小黄片
blew all the dough on room service and porn.

532
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:04,652
这是我为当初付出的代价
This was back when you had to pay for it.

533
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:09,657
伙计 那些日子都过去了
Man. Those were the days.

534
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:12,560
这些年来我再没想过这些事
I haven't thought about that in years.

535
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:15,964
我的基佬养父有很多好东西
My foster gays have a lot of nice stuff.

536
00:22:15,998 --> 00:22:17,398
你的基佬养父
Your foster gays?

537
00:22:17,432 --> 00:22:18,799
Cassius和Lanier
Cassius and Lanier.

538
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:21,569
你这是在
Are you suggesting...

539
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:23,070
我能认为你这是在暗示什么吗
what I think you're suggesting?

540
00:22:23,104 --> 00:22:26,406
-他们都有些啥  -有iPod 电脑
- What do they got? - iPods, computers...

541
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:28,141
-他们什么时候呆在那里  -他们周末上班
- How often they there? - They work weekends.

542
00:22:28,176 --> 00:22:30,076
-你能搞定门锁吗  -我有他们的安保密码
- Can you pick a lock? - I have their security code.

543
00:22:30,111 --> 00:22:33,580
这样说来
Is that so?

544
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:39,485
就这样吧
That's all right.

大家一起游戏 唱歌 还有好多小孩
There's playing, and singing, and kids.

569

And there's dirt. Oh, you love dirt!

570
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:49,655
我能动你的耳朵吗 你还是讨厌这么做吗
Can I do your ears,or do you still hate that?

571
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:52,090
别碰耳朵
My ears.

572
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,725
Jody在哪儿
Where's Jody?

573
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,161
他去了王太太家 把Hymie接过来
He's at the Wongs', picking up Hymie.

574
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:58,796
你还记得Hymie吗
Do you remember Hymie?

575
00:23:58,831 --> 00:24:02,233
我记得 那个小蒙古人
I remember.The Asian mongoloid.

576
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:05,469
实际上我们可以叫他傻子
Actually, we can call him a retard.

577
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:07,905
只要我们不是歧视他就可以
We've earned that right.

578
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:09,674
你想和他呆一会吗
Do you want to spend time with him?

579

他非常特别
He is so special.

582
00:24:16,215 --> 00:24:19,017
你知道 我那天看了一部电影
You know, I saw this movie the other day

583
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:20,652
是关于世界各国的婴儿们的
about babies around the world.

584
00:24:20,686 --> 00:24:23,021
你知道那些非洲的母亲
Do you know that mothers in Africa

585
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:26,592
会把孩子放在膝头来擦他们的脏屁屁么
wipe their babies' dirty bottoms on their knees?

586
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:29,261
-Jody在哪儿  -在王太太家
- Where's Jody? - At the Wongs'.

587
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:32,297
然后她们会用树叶来擦掉粑粑
And then they use leaves to scrape the poop off.

588
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:35,133
我想说 那为什么不一开始就用树叶包住好了
I mean, why not just use the leaves in the first place?

589
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,268
我不明白为什么待在一个全是细菌的
I don't understand why they're not

590
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:39,671
地方一点也不会让他们恶心
sick all the time over there with all that bacteria.

他不太舒服
He doesn't feel well.

606
00:25:27,587 --> 00:25:30,422
哦 你脸色可真差
Oh, you look like garbage.

607
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:31,723

No temperature.

609

Can we still go? Liam will be so sad.

这个楼梯通向偏房
And these stairs lead to the side room,

731
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:37,424
然后这个是去卧室的过道
and this is the hallway to the bedroom.

732
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:38,925
这个是外面的桌子
This is the outside deck.

733
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,294
这是客厅 这是厨房
The living room, the kitchen,

734
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:42,996
另一间卧室 还有前厅
the other bedroom,and the front room.

735
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,197
老天爷啊 这个地方有多大
My God, how big is this place?

736
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:46,633
- 很大 - 混蛋
- Big. - Bastards.

737
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:48,601
没有棉花糖了
There's no more marshmallows.

738
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:50,169
我讨厌这个
I hate that.

739
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:52,939
这么一大包里面只有十个
They give you, like, ten in the whole bag.

740
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:55,776
- 如果他们抓到我们了怎么办 - 往好处想
- What if they catch us? - Visualize success.

741
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,311
如果他们采集到指纹怎么办
What if they dust for fingerprints?

742
00:32:57,345 --> 00:33:00,280
我们一直戴着手套 找到一个
Always wear gloves. Got one.

743
00:33:00,315 --> 00:33:01,782
这是个小宝箱 是个好兆头
It's a treasure chest. That's a good omen.

744
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:03,651
那要是DNA测验怎么办
What about DNA testing?

745
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:06,287
这种小盗窃 没人会用那种CSI的破玩意
Nobody bothers with that <i>CSI</i>crap, not on a burglary.
(CSI:犯罪现场调查)

746
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:09,691
那些警察不会管这些偷鸡摸狗的屁事的
Cops'll see these faggots, they won't give three wet farts.

747
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:11,459
跟我干吗
Are you with me?

748

749
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:18,801
好吧 一 二 三 走你
Okay, one, two, three, go.

750
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:20,536
呃 下次再来吧
Eh, we'll get it next time.

752
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:36,219
你还一口没动呢 Steve
You haven't taken one bite, Steve.

753
00:33:36,253 --> 00:33:38,087
这些好吃的都浪费了
All this food going to waste.

755
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:44,727
好吧 跟我说说
Now, tell me...

756
00:33:44,762 --> 00:33:47,530
我听说的 关于医学院的事
I hear reports of, um, medical school.

757
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:49,065
我一月份回学校
Uh, going back in January.

758
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:51,367
以后可能会成为一名皮肤科或者外科大夫
I'm gonna become a dermatologist or a surgeon.

759
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:52,735
不错
Good.

760
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:55,238
外科整形现在很吃香
Cosmetic surgery's a rich field.

761
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:57,106
非常有钱途 很有潜力
Very lucrative. Much potential.

762
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,774
十分正确
Indeed.

763
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:00,710
但这个需要你搬到另一个州去
And this would require a move to another state.

764
00:34:00,744 --> 00:34:03,012
只是暂时的 我--我还在敲定细节
Only temporary. I'm-- I'm still working out the details.

765
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:04,747
你知道的 我 我真的只是想
You know, I-I really just want to do

766
00:34:04,782 --> 00:34:06,115
做一些造福大家的事
what's best for everyone.

767
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,417
这可听着像是你想
Well, it sounds like you want to do

768
00:34:07,451 --> 00:34:09,018
做一些造福自己的事
what's best for yourself.

769
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:11,120
呃 但对Estefania来说有个
Uh, but having a doctor husband for Estefania

770
00:34:11,155 --> 00:34:12,755
做大夫的丈夫是件好事
would be a great thing.

771
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:17,627
在美国 医生们都是英雄
You know, in America, doctors are seen as heroes.

772
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:19,061
我对你们的文化很了解
I'm familiar with your culture.

773
00:34:19,096 --> 00:34:20,797
但重点是
But the point being is it's--

774
00:34:20,831 --> 00:34:23,466
这什么都很好 安娜堡是个很棒的地方
it's all good, you know? Ann Arbor's a great town.

775
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,001
那儿有很多商场
There's lots of shops.

777
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:32,107
你上次见我女儿是什么时候了
And when was the last time you've seen my daughter?

778
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:33,709
呃 两天之前
Uh, two days ago.

779
00:34:33,743 --> 00:34:34,710
怎么了
Why?

780
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:39,281
三个小时之前我见到她了
I saw her three hours ago.

781
00:34:39,315 --> 00:34:42,584
在移民规划局
In INS Holding.

782
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:45,621
我觉得你应该还不知道她已经被驱逐了
I suppose you're not aware she's being deported.

783
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:47,122
等等 为 为什么
Wait, why? Why--

784
00:34:47,156 --> 00:34:49,491
昨天你错过了移民局的家访 Steve
You missed an INS visityesterday, Steve.

785
00:34:49,526 --> 00:34:50,960
她为什么不给我打电话
Why didn't she call me?

786
00:34:50,994 --> 00:34:53,895
她打了 你没接
Well, she tried. You didn't pick up.

787
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,231
而且她没能成功打动检查人员
And she failed to impress the authorities.

788
00:34:56,265 --> 00:34:58,433
她甚至不知道你的生日
Didn't even know your birthday.

789
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:02,304
我的生日是圣诞节! 记住这个能有多难
My birthday is Christmas! How hard is that to remember?

790
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:03,905
还有你妈妈的名字
And your mother's name.

791
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,640
这是我的错吗 我们  我们都用卡片记过了
This is my fault? We did-- we did flash cards.

792
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:08,676
我不能时时刻刻在她身边
I can't be with her every second.

793
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:12,480
我对你要求很少 Steve
I ask so little of you, Steve.

794
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:14,416
就那么一点点
So little.

795
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,917
别惹麻烦
Stay out of trouble.

796
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:18,319
照顾好我女儿
Be attentive to my daughter.

797
00:35:18,353 --> 00:35:20,454
她在这个国家的居住权是没有保证的
Her presence in this country is controversial.

798
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:22,190
你知道的
You understand that.

799
00:35:22,224 --> 00:35:26,861
我们是活在显微镜下的 我以为你明白的
We were under a microscope. I thought I made that clear.

800
00:35:26,895 --> 00:35:28,629
发生这事我非常抱歉
Look, I'm so sorry this happened,

801
00:35:28,663 --> 00:35:31,499
我不知道应该怎么做才能防止它的发生
I just don't know what could've been done to prevent it.

802
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:36,470
这正是问题关键 不是吗 Steve
That's precisely the problem, isn't it, Steve?

803
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:37,938
现在怎么办
What now?

804
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:41,642
发生的事情没法回头
Well, what's done cannot be undone.

805
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:45,946
现在我必须到处给点好处
Now I must grease many palms.

806
00:35:45,981 --> 00:35:48,749
事情才会解决的
It will be dealt with.

807
00:36:00,496 --> 00:36:01,830
等等 所以你刚才的意思是
Wait, so you're telling me

808
00:36:01,864 --> 00:36:03,632
你从来没去过脱衣舞俱乐部
you've never been to a strip club?

809
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:04,834
没有 光想想贴身舞
No. Just the thought of a lap dance

810
00:36:04,868 --> 00:36:06,669
就已经让我神魂颠倒了
actually makes me woozy.

811
00:36:06,703 --> 00:36:08,805
就像 你看我像在调戏人吗
Like, do I grope?

812
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:11,875
如果 怎么才能调戏她的同时不冒犯她
If-- how do I go about doing that in, like, a non-offensive way?

813
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:13,410
好比 要有眼神交流吗 或者
Like, do I make eye contact, or is that--

814
00:36:13,444 --> 00:36:15,212
那应该是很冒犯她们的 我的意思是
that could be insulting, 'cause I mean,

815
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:16,847
她们在身体上下了那么大的功夫
she works so hard on her body.

816
00:36:16,881 --> 00:36:19,082
哇 你真的是个绅士
Wow, you really are a gentleman.

817
00:36:19,117 --> 00:36:20,984
我才不是个绅士
I am hardly a gentleman.

818
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:24,721
我只是对于被迫的亲密有些不接受
I just have a problem with forced intimacy.

819
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:25,855
怪我妈妈
Blame my mother.

820
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,657
你妈妈以前是个脱衣舞女
Your mom was a stripper?

822
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:30,694
现在也是
Still a stripper, by the way.

823
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:32,763
九十岁了
90 years old

824
00:36:32,797 --> 00:36:34,832
她得花四十分钟解开内衣
Takes her like 40 minutes to unhook her bra,

825
00:36:34,866 --> 00:36:37,334
但是她解的时候 真是场好戏
but when she does, what a show.

826
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:44,675
所以 呃 
So, um...

827
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,378
我们好像是没去参加聚会
we sorta ditched the party.

828
00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:49,681
是 确实是
Yeah, we sorta did.

829
00:36:49,715 --> 00:36:52,417
我现在要说三个想法
I'm gonna make three assumptions.

830
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:53,752
说吧
Fire away.

831
00:36:53,786 --> 00:36:56,621
好的 第一 你像我一样醉
Okay, one, you're as drunk as I am.

832
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:59,624
正确 嘘
Correct. Shh.

833
00:36:59,658 --> 00:37:02,461
第二 你像我一样冷
Two, you're as cold as I am.

834
00:37:02,495 --> 00:37:03,728
比你冷 我穿的少
Colder. Less padding.

835
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,863
忽略这个
I'm gonna ignore that.

836
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:09,034
第三
Three...

837
00:37:09,068 --> 00:37:12,371
你也是个绅士
you're a gentleman.

838
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:14,640
错了
False.

839
00:37:14,674 --> 00:37:15,774
正相反
Quite the opposite.

841
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,377
那么 你最好表现出来
Well, then you better behave yourself,

842
00:37:19,412 --> 00:37:21,146
因为我还没有醉到不会邀请你
because I am way too drunk not to invite you

843
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:25,183
去我的帐篷
back to my tent right now.

844
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:34,493
该死的 Gallagher
God damn, Gallagher.

845
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:37,796
以后我得让你多生生气
I oughta get you pissed off more often.

846
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:40,098
所以 我们现在怎么办
So, what are we gonna do?

847
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,733
告诉大家都走吧
We gonna tell everyone to leave?

848
00:37:41,768 --> 00:37:43,168
不
Nah.

849
00:37:43,203 --> 00:37:44,670
我去解决了这件破事
I'll go get this shit over with,

850
00:37:44,704 --> 00:37:46,472
你在这等我
and, uh, you can wait here for me.

851
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:48,908
不会超过一个小时吧
Shouldn't take more than an hour, right?

852
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:50,910
你最好准备好大战第二回合
You better be ready for round two.

853
00:37:50,944 --> 00:37:53,679
你不想解决这件事对吧
You're not seriously going through with this, are you?

854
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:54,680
你为什么要表现出一副好像我有的选得表情
Why are you acting like I got a choice in this?

855
00:37:54,714 --> 00:37:57,582
这全是他妈的放屁
This is bullshit.

856
00:37:57,617 --> 00:37:59,184
听我说 Mickey
Listen to me, Mickey.

857
00:37:59,218 --> 00:38:04,021
你爸爸是个恶魔 是个变态
Your dad is an evil, psychotic prick.

858
00:38:04,056 --> 00:38:06,524
你想让他就这么毁了你一辈子
You're just gonna let him ruin your life?

859
00:38:06,558 --> 00:38:08,259
你他妈应该学会长大了
You need to grow the fuck up.

860
00:38:08,293 --> 00:38:10,161
别装的像你很了解我爸似的
Don't act like you know a thing about my dad.

861
00:38:10,195 --> 00:38:11,862
你他妈搞笑呢吧
Are you fucking kidding me?

862
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:16,867
没有人能
Not everybody gets to just--

863
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:18,968
没有人会
not everybody just gets to

864
00:38:19,003 --> 00:38:22,973
没人时时刻刻都他妈实话实说
blurt out how they fuckin' feel every minute.

865
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,381
大家都在找你
Everyone's looking for you.

866
00:38:30,415 --> 00:38:34,285
我抽根烟 这也不行吗
I'm having a fuckin' smoke. Is that all right?

867
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:39,191
你刚到
You just get here?

868
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:41,220
是
Yeah.

869
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:42,393
我都不知道你要来
I didn't know you were coming.

870
00:38:42,427 --> 00:38:44,729
临时决定的
Last-minute decision.

871
00:38:44,763 --> 00:38:46,831
来吧
Come on.

872
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:46,422
♪ Dead man walking
like a wind-up toy ♪

873
00:39:46,457 --> 00:39:49,392
♪ plodding, never plotting for
the things that bring him joy ♪

874
00:39:49,427 --> 00:39:51,561
♪ living in the movies

什么 你还好吗
What, what? You okay?

886
00:40:36,974 --> 00:40:38,241
我这是在干什么
What am I doing? What am I doing?

887
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:40,643
你想先暂停吗 我们可以的
Do you want to stop? We can stop.

888
00:40:40,677 --> 00:40:42,644
-我很抱歉  -别这样  
- I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry.

889
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:44,813
我们会好的 不是吗 即使发生了这些
We got carried away, all right? These things happen.

890
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:47,482
我不知道我在干什么
I don't know what I'm doing.

891
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:49,183
你在利用我报复
You're using me for revenge.

892
00:40:49,217 --> 00:40:50,851
有吗
Am I?

893
00:40:50,886 --> 00:40:54,355
我不是说我介意 我真的不介意
I'm not saying that I mind. I-I-I do not mind.

894
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:56,658
我只是确认下原因
I just recognize the impulse.

895
00:40:56,692 --> 00:40:58,526
他计划丢下我一个人去密歇根
He was planning on going to Michigan without me.

896
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,027
混蛋
Oh, shit.

897
00:41:00,062 --> 00:41:01,929
他装作好像要把我们都带走
He acted like he was gonna take all of us,

898
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:04,432
但这已经不是他第一次说谎了
but it's not even the first time that he's lied.

899
00:41:04,466 --> 00:41:06,500
我又被他骗了
I closed my stupid eyes to it

900
00:41:06,535 --> 00:41:09,003
因为我没想到到事情会这样糟
'cause I wanted it to work so bad.

901
00:41:09,037 --> 00:41:10,871
你并不傻
Your eyes aren't stupid.

902
00:41:10,906 --> 00:41:13,174
不 我就是个傻瓜
Oh, I'm an idiot.

903
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,476
只是有人骗了你
Just because someone dumps on you

904
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,278
并不意味着你不是个姑娘
does not mean you deserve it.

905
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,782
告诉我她什么时候骗过你
Tell me that when someone's dumping on you.

906
00:41:25,654 --> 00:41:28,556
Eve?

907
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,724
那是我妻子
That's my wife.

908
00:41:30,759 --> 00:41:33,060
前妻 
Ex-wife. God.

909
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:35,831
我们上周就离婚了
Papers went through last week.

910
00:41:35,865 --> 00:41:38,400
我太懦弱了 我都不敢把这个去掉
I'm kinda too chicken to get it removed,

911
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:42,304
所以我考虑换一个好一点的词
so I'm thinking about making it into a bigger word.

912
00:41:42,338 --> 00:41:44,806
比如
Like, uh...

913
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,741
sleeve 也许            
"Sleeve" maybe.

914
00:41:46,776 --> 00:41:49,044
eleven吧 我不知道
"Eleven." I don't know.

915
00:41:51,347 --> 00:41:53,215
我想你很庆幸她的名字不是Ocksucker
I guess you're lucky her name wasn't "Ocksucker."

916
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:59,421
的确
Yeah.

917
00:41:59,456 --> 00:42:01,223
的确
Yeah.

918
00:42:03,193 --> 00:42:05,328
你什么时候发现出事了
When did you know when it was over?

919
00:42:05,362 --> 00:42:10,033
当她开始每天去体育馆
When she started going to the gym every day.

920
00:42:10,067 --> 00:42:12,102
你
You?

921
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:26,183
毫不犹豫
Without a hitch.

922
00:42:26,218 --> 00:42:27,885
儿子 你做的好
Son, you did good.

923
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,389
把门关上 把门关上
Close the door. Close the door.

924
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,391
你觉得这些值多少
How much you think it's all worth?

925
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,360
不知道 3千也许
I don't know. Maybe 3 grand?

926
00:42:35,394 --> 00:42:36,928
真的 够本了
- Really? - Damn straight.

927
00:42:36,962 --> 00:42:38,296
好了 来庆祝吧
Hey, let's celebrate.

928
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,999
去给我们做点意大利面

Lis-- listen, I know that I got sloppy, Nando,

930

但我会弥补的 告诉我该做什么

Run-- run drugs, steal cars,

932
00:42:57,685 --> 00:42:58,652
你知道 我爸爸和政府有关系

933
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,054
他很厉害的
He's a powerful man.

934
00:43:00,088 --> 00:43:02,056
他支持着移民法案
He supported immigration legislation--

935
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,892
今天交通太堵了 是那些年轻人都出来玩吗
So much traffic today. Are the cubs playing?

936
00:43:04,926 --> 00:43:06,327

我指的是 不完全的 当然
I mean, not entirely, of course,

939
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:10,598
但我对规矩很清楚

940
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:12,066
你知道 我百分之百和你一样
You know, I'm absolutely on the same page as you.

941
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,202
我是说 真的谢谢你
I mean, thank you for that. Truly. Truly.

942
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:22,277
来让我们看看那是谁

王女士同意她带hymie走吗

We can talk.



970
00:45:06,715 --> 00:45:08,383

绕着林肯公园跑
and, uh, ran around Lincoln Park

973
00:45:12,554 --> 00:45:15,957
弄响了所有的普锐斯的报警器

我们爬上了林肯雕像
we climbed the Lincoln statue

977
00:45:21,563 --> 00:45:24,732
然后给老亚伯涂了点口红
