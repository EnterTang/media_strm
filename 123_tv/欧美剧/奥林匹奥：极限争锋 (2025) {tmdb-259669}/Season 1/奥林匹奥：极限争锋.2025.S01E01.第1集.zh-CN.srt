1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,280
有人说英雄都是天生的
Some say heroes are born.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,160
还有一些人说英雄都是后天培养的
Others they're made.

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,600
可我只知道有一个英雄
I only ever knew one.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
名字叫做贝奥武夫
Beowulf.'

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,640
驾
Ya!

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,120
父亲
Father!

7
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,280
快跑
Run!

8
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,880
呀
Ya!

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,760
啊啊啊
Aaaagh!

10
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,760
死亡圣殿将会欢迎他的到来
He will be welcomed in the Halls of the Dead.

11
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,720
我知道
I know.

12
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,240
我是赫罗斯加
I'm Hrothgar.

13
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,840
鹿厅的领主
Thane of Heorot.

14
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,870
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

15
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,600
贝奥武夫
Beowulf.

16
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,240
人们会记住你的名字的
The people will remember it.

17
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,720
贝奥武夫
Beowulf?

18
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,500
为什么千里迢迢来到这里去看一个老领主死去
Why come so far to watch an old thane die?

19
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,500
我们分开的时候很不愉快
We parted badly.

20
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,100
我不能就这样放任不管
I wouldn't leave it that way.

21
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,000
重返护盾大陆

22
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,000
第一集

23
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,960
你难道没把尸体埋在护盾大陆吗
Don't you bury your dead in the Shieldlands?

24
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,440
-是一个泥巴种干的  -山怪干的
- A mud-born did this.  - A troll?

25
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,680
咬痕很小还很深
The bite marks are too small and deep.

26
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,550
根本没时间去埋他的尸体
There's no time to bury him.

27
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,200
如果我们还想要在天黑之前赶到鹿厅的话
Not if we're to make Heorot by nightfall.

28
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,470
我真不喜欢这地方
I don't like this place.

29
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,270
好啊 那你就回家啊
Well, then, go home.

30
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,520
面对那帮动私刑的暴民
Face that lynch mob.

31
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,880
他们不是暴民 就是亲密的朋友恰好还是死去那个老人的家人
It wasn't a mob. Just close friends and family of the dead man.

32
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,030
你亲手杀了的那个老伙儿
The dead man you killed.

33
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,520
每个故事都有好坏两个方面
There are two sides to every story.

34
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,150
那你为什么要把我从这帮人手里救出来
Why did you save me from them, anyway?

35
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,470
我们都会犯错
We all make mistakes.

36
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,870
当你说你们分开的时候很不愉快
When you said you parted badly...

37
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,760
现在看看周围 我想知道有多不愉快
from the look of things,I'm wondering how badly?

38
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,430
你那把小刀是不是需要修理一下
Still need that blade of yours fixed?

39
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,950
现在就是很好的时机
Now might be a good time.

40
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,240
-怎么了  -贝奥武夫
- What is it?  - Beowulf.

41
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,980
你知道我们不能让你进去的
You know we can't let you enter.

42
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,550
你二十年前动作就不麻利
You were slow 20 years ago.

43
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,140
你现在只能会更慢
You'll only be slower now.

44
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,040
你好啊 史林
Hello, Slean.

45
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,120
杀了他
Kill him.

46
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,520
贝奥武夫
Beowulf!

47
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
够了
Enough!

48
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
史林
Slean.

49
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,040
在我做总管时 我不允许这座大殿被鲜血染红
There'll be no more blood spilt in this hall while I'm Reeve.

50
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,390
他已经被驱逐了
He was banished.

51
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,580
任何人都会犯错
On anyone's orders.

52
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,550
我来见赫罗斯加
I'm here to see Hrothgar.

53
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,040
贝奥武夫
Beowulf!

54
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,380
赫罗斯加已经死了
Hrothgar's dead.

55
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,170
铁匠在哪
Where's the smith?

56
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,660
你现在就看着她呢
You're looking at her.

57
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,780
你是个女孩
You're a girl.

58
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,820
有着一个大铁锤的女孩
With a big hammer.

59
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,100
你觉得你可以用大铁锤修好这个吗
Think you can fix this with that big hammer of yours?

60
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,200
如果你先把钱给我 我就可以
If you pay upfront, I can.

61
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,450
你觉得我配不上这把好刀吗
You don't think I'm good for it?

62
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,900
以你貌取人有问题吗
Does being judged on your appearance trouble you?

63
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,890
今晚的宴会就是为了纪念赫罗斯加
Tonight we feast in Hrothgar's honour.

64
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,140
我可以去看他的遗体吗 向他道别
May I see the body? To say farewell.

65
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,970
史林 不管我们之间发生过什么都已经过去了
Slean, whatever else has passed between us...

66
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,820
这不是我儿子就可以决定的
That is not my son's decision.

67
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,420
我现在是大领主了
I am Thane.

68
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,660
丽达 人的最后一餐是不可以被他的朋友和家人拒之门外的
Rheda, no family or friend can be turned away from a man's last feast.

69
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,740
你什么都不是
You're neither.

70
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,420
住手 让他留下
No. Let him stay.

71
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,620
我不会让我丈夫的名誉受到玷污 但是你绝不能去见他的遗体
I would not dishonour my husband,but you will not see the body.

72
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,900
丽达 丽达
Rheda? Rheda!

73
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,730
发生什么事了
What is going on?

74
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
哥哥
Brother?

75
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,490
你到底要不要介绍我 你这老滑头
Well, are you gonna announce me or not, you old goat?

76
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,010
布莱根的大领主 阿布莱肯
Abrecan, Thane of Bregan.

77
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,060
妹妹
Sister.

78
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,210
或者我现在应该称呼你为鹿厅的大领主了
Or should I address you as Thane of Heorot now?

79
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,260
进来吧
Come.

80
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,980
史林 过来听听你舅舅的新鲜事
Slean, come and hear your uncle's news.

81
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,380
管好你自己 小子
Watch yourself, lad.

82
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,300
-你干的  -那时候他正准备要杀了我呢
- You did this.  - He was trying to kill me at the time.

83
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,730
那你至少帮我给他挪个地方吧
Well, at least help me move him.

84
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,460
其他领主会在葬礼仪式结束后来这里集合
The other thanes arrive for the gathering after the funeral rites.

85
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,330
而且他们都将会赞成你继承赫罗斯加的
And they all vote for you to succeed Hrothgar.

86
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,380
一个大领主必须统治我们所有人 为什么不是你呢
One thane must rule us all. Why not you?

87
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,660
有些人怀疑我父亲继承人的提名
Some doubt my father's nomination as his successor.

88
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,850
还在对你父亲把你忽略了感到隐隐作痛吗 侄子
Still smarting that Hrothgar passed you over, nephew?

89
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,220
如果他们真的怀疑 那他们肯定不会像我这样了解你母亲
If they do, they do not know your mother as I do.

90
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,800
你丈夫做了一个勇敢的决定
It was a bold choice your husband made.

91
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,490
人们迟早都会来的 给他们点时间
People will come round. Give it time.

92
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,700
没有时间了
There is no time.

93
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,890
把他放到这里 帮我个忙
Leave him in there. Give me a hand here.

94
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,740
快点
Quickly.

95
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,890
他的肩膀受伤了
It's his shoulder.

96
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,340
我知道
I know.

97
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,250
-都归你了  -帮我扶着他
- All yours.  - Hold him.

98
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,370
扶紧点 他又不会去亲你
Tightly. He's not gonna kiss you.

99
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,250
-归位会很疼但你会活下来的  -准备好没
- It'll hurt a lot more going back in but you'll live. - Ready?

100
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,050
你和以前的治疗师很不同
You're different to the old healer.

101
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,410
一 二
One, two...

102
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,380
啊
Agh!

103
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,410
-哪点不一样  -更暴力了
- Different how? - More violent?

104
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,820
好吧
Well...

105
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
可以走了
Move.

106
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,060
包扎一下他的手 可以吗
Bandage his hand, will you?

107
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,100
-我想我可以来帮忙   -或者是拜仁派你来监视我
- Thought I might help. - Or Bayen sent you to keep an eye on me.

108
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,380
好吧 你确实显得比较异类
Well, you made quite the impression.

109
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,140
-你为什么要留下来参加宴会呢  - 你对我在这吃喝有意见吗
- Why are you staying for the feast?- You begrudge me food and drink?

110
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,210
你们能换个地方来交流了解彼此吗
Would you to mind getting to know each other somewhere else?

111
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,300
就这样么  连句谢谢都没有
That's it? No thanks?

112
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,290
你是他们能在这存活的原因
Well, you are the reason they're here.

113
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,260
说得好
Fair point.

114
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,170
你会参加今天晚上的宴会么
Will you be at the feast tonight?

115
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,090
每个人都要去
Everyone will.

116
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,540
有人已经死了而晚上还要举办宴会
Somebody's died and there's a feast tonight.

117
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,620
我们应该留下来
We should stay.

118
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,700
那是你的老领主
It's your old thane.

119
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,330
我表示同情
My sympathies.

120
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,380
别说虚假的话了
You almost sound like you mean it.

121
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,940
他是个伟大的人
He was a great man.

122
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,820
留下他满腔怒火的儿子
Who left his son full of rage.

123
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,930
最起码丽达是个有智慧的人
At least Rheda is wise.

124
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,780
但是她够强大么
But is she strong?

125
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,220
她有我们
She has us.

126
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,100
我去叫丽达准备一下  你要确保贝奥武夫远离这个屋子
I'll have Rheda ready. You keep Beowulf from this chamber.

127
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,340
这间厅里装满了回忆
This hall is full of memories.

128
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,260
贝奥武夫
Beowulf.

129
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,580
贝奥武夫
Beowulf?

130
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,960
-没有已婚女子  -嗯嗬
- No married women. - Hm?

131
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,460
爱情是盲目的
Love is blind.

132
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,460
这是我丈夫的守灵夜
My husband's wake.

133
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,540
而我所能做的就是咒骂他委任我成为继承人
And all I can do is curse him for appointing me his successor.

134
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,090
这裙子 是全新的
The dress, it's new.

135
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,340
还有点紧
It's a little tight.

136
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,890
你本可以拒绝他
You could've refused him.

137
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,540
让你儿子成为新领主
Let your son become Thane.

138
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,250
赫罗斯加是对的 史林还没准备好
Hrothgar was right. Slean's not ready.

139
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,610
他们都在等你
They're waiting for you.

140
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,210
你没有必要在今晚就接手赫罗斯加的遗嘱
You don't have to be Hrothgar tonight.

141
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,620
就像新裙子 权利与服饰相匹配
Like a new dress, power fits better with the wearing.

142
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,540
拜托
Please!

143
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,570
你会适应的
You'll become accustomed to it.

144
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,720
甚至可能会很享受它
May even come to enjoy it.

145
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,340
记住 在男人来到护盾大陆前
Remember, before man came to the Shieldlands,

146
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,500
在这唯一的物种是泥巴种
the only living things here were the mud-born.

147
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,820
巨人们 侏儒们和犬妖
Giants, trolls and the wolf-like barghest.

148
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,220
流淌着黑色血液 从这黑色的泥土里出生
All with black blood, all born from this land's dark dirt.

149
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,860
来吧
Go on.

150
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,420
我记得我干过这事但是记不起来为什么了
I remember doing it but I don't remember why...

151
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,420
哈
Ho!

152
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,900
不要刻意追求尊荣
Don't go seeking after glory.

153
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,680
它会主动来找你
It'll find you.

154
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,600
史林
Slean?

155
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,170
他没有继承王位
He didn't succeed his father.

156
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,540
任命继承者是赫罗斯加的权利
It was Hrothgar's right to name his successor.

157
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,650
他确实一直给人一种恶作剧的感觉
He always did have a sense of mischief.

158
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,930
你不认为一个女人可以掌权
You don't think a woman can rule?

159
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,020
大部分人都是
Many do.

160
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,100
几乎没人相信
Few are seen to.

161
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,380
拜仁 我们想今晚要回我们的酬劳
Bayen, we want our pay tonight.

162
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,620
不 你们要像其他人一样等着  现在让我走
No. You wait like everyone else. Now let go of me.

163
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,860
塔恩
Tarn.

164
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,440
你的总管有点老啊
Your reeve's a little long in the tooth.

165
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,930
赫罗斯加很信赖他
Hrothgar relied on him.

166
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,980
我肯定也一样
And I must, too.

167
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,380
一个寡妇
A widow.

168
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,690
她丈夫六年前死了
Her husband died six summers ago.

169
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,210
她现在自己经营着铁匠铺
She owns the smithy now.

170
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,260
我们的不速之客  弄清他想干什么
Our unwanted guest, find out his intentions.

171
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,660
这是利拉 来自铁匠铺
This is Lila. From the smithy.

172
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,930
我见过你的女儿 很直率的女孩
I met your daughter. Forthright girl.

173
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,780
她这点是遗传我
She gets it from me.

174
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,380
你并不是想买五节铁链 是不
You're not looking to buying five lengths of iron chain, are you?

175
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,770
不是的
Not really, no.

176
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
很好
Good.

177
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,180
我来这不是工作的
I didn't come here to work.

178
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,580
手怎么样了
How's the hand?

179
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,320
你不能进入禁地
Y-You can't enter the private quarters.

180
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,140
贝奥武夫 在这没有你的容身之地
Beowulf, you have no place here.

181
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,460
拜仁 我只是想看下赫罗斯加
Bayen. I just want to see Hrothgar.

182
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,480
你已经听见丽达说的了
You heard Rheda.

183
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,370
你当护盾人多少年了
How many years were you a Shieldman?

184
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,420
-30年  -总管当了10年
- 30? - And Reeve for ten.

185
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,660
并不仅仅如此 我帮助他教育他儿子 和你
Not only that, I helped him teach his son, and you,

186
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,330
从一个剑端到另一个  如果你记得的话
one end of a sword from another, if you remember.

187
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,540
我还记得
I do.

188
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,650
所以你明白我们之间是怎样的
So you know how it was between us.

189
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,290
赫罗斯加就像我的父亲
Hrothgar was like a father to me.

190
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,810
你是一个很棒的学生
You were a good learner.

191
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,450
也是一个很棒的剑手
Good sword-hand, too.

192
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,900
史林 你的关节都发白了 不要握的太紧
Slean, your knuckles are white. Don't hold it so tight.

193
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,140
不用你来告诉我怎么做 你以为你是谁
Don't tell me what to do. Who do you think you are?

194
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,500
你过不去的
You'll not pass.

195
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,490
你什么都不是 贝奥武夫
You're nothing, Beowulf.

196
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,330
你父亲也一无是处
Your father was nothing.

197
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,660
住手 现在
Stop it! Now!

198
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,610
你什么都不算 贝奥武夫
'You're nothing, Beowulf.'

199
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,330
我可以杀了你
I could kill you.

200
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,100
你本可以但是你不会
You could but you won't.

201
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,890
你希望是其他人么
Would you rather it was someone else?

202
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,740
-什么  -贝奥武夫
- What? - Beowulf.

203
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,060
-我看见你了 -和他讲话
- I saw you. -Talking to him.

204
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,500
你还没完全拥有我
You don't own me.

205
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,700
我会的
But I would.

206
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,780
你的母亲不会同意的
Your mother would never allow it.

207
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,700
拜仁
Bayen?

208
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,260
如果没有人替我报仇
If I'm not avenged...

209
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,890
我将无法进入死亡圣殿
I'll never enter the Halls of the Dead.

210
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,420
我会替你报仇的  我发誓
I will avenge you. I swear it.

211
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,020
杀人凶手
Murderer.

212
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,120
真的是你杀了他吗
Is it true?

213
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,070
一个泥巴种杀死了拜仁
A mud-born killed Bayen.

214
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,240
现场没有野兽  只有他  他当时站在尸体旁边
There was no beast, only him. He stood over the body.

215
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,310
杀人偿命 这是你极度热爱的法令规定的
Blood for blood, that's what the law you love so much says.

216
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,000
你没有证据  没有目击到 也没有动机
You've no evidence, no witness and no motive.

217
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,870
缺乏任何一个条件 一个人都无法被定罪
Without one of these, a man cannot be condemned.

218
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,920
他有动机
He had motive.

219
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,200
拜仁拒绝了他看一眼赫罗斯加的请求
Bayen turned him away from Hrothgar's body.

220
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,380
-他威胁了拜仁  -威胁
- He threatened him. - Threatened?

221
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,220
那只是老朋友之间开的玩笑
It was banter, between old friends.

222
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,880
当即处决他  干净利落
Do it here, quick and clean.

223
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,240
请您对现在做出决定 而不是对过去
Make your decision on the present, not the past.

224
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,000
以一个领主的身份 而不是以一个母亲的身份
As a thane, not as a mother.

225
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,680
-她根本不是你的母亲  -安静
- She was never your mother! - Be quiet!

226
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,830
你就是个废物贝奥武夫  你父亲也是个废物
You're nothing, Beowulf. Your father was nothing.

227
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,640
-停下 马上  -他差点就杀掉我
- Stop it! Now! - He tried to kill me.

228
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,390
刚才是他无端袭击
It was an unprovoked attack.

229
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,670
贝奥武夫想杀死我儿子
Beowulf tried to kill my son.

230
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
我们的儿子
Our son.

231
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,920
他会在老地方被处决
It will be done in the usual place.

232
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,600
不要让任何人看到
Before any who wish to see.

233
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
这是我们的规定
That is our law.

234
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,000
-我可以跟你一起出去吗  -今天不行
- Can I come? - Not today.

235
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,870
我要赶很长时间的路 而且我想天黑之前回来
I've a long way to go and I want to be back before dark.

236
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,920
下次吧
Next time.

237
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,510
-噢 我的新女儿  -抱歉你在说什么
- Ah! My new daughter. - I'm sorry?

238
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,550
-你妈妈和我  -你对她做了什么
- Your mother and I  - What did you do to her?

239
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,390
我娶了她 然后和她上床了
Married her, then shared her bed.

240
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,840
那不是你的制服吗
Isn't that your custom?

241
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,920
停下
Stop!

242
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,470
你在想什么啊
What were you thinking?!

243
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,200
我什么也没想啊
I wasn't.

244
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,120
我有预感 他们会杀了你和你的朋友
I had my way, they'd kill you with your friend.

245
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,750
什么
What?

246
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,710
- 爱尔维纳  -别急
- Elvina! - Easy.

247
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,710
-她朝那边走了  -她发生了什么
- She went that way.  - What happened to her?

248
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,950
一个泥巴种 它追着她跑
A mud-born beast, he chased after her.

249
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,430
-在哪 -畜栏那边
- Where?  - Past the corral.

250
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,950
朝着西部丛林的方向
Toward the Western Wood?

251
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,820
带我走
Took your time.

252
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,040
哇哦  稳当点
Whoa! Steady.

253
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,760
快拦住他们
Stop them!

254
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,460
史林 你在做什么
Slean? What do you think you're doing?

255
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,790
如果他接替了赫罗斯加的位置
If he's ever to take Hrothgar's place,

256
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,070
他一定被视作一位战士
he must be seen as a warrior.

257
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,400
-而我不是  - 丽达 我
- As I'm not?  - Rheda, I...

258
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,000
这是事实
It's true.

259
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,280
我也许永远不会手握宝剑或让Huskarl陷入战争
I may never wield a sword or lead the Huskarl into battle.

260
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,720
我永远不会成为赫罗斯加
I'll never be Hrothgar.

261
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,600
但我会统治这片领土
But I will rule.

262
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,760
哇哦 稳下来 稳下来
Whoa! Steady! Steady!

263
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,540
死的犬妖  是野兽杀死的
Dead barghest. Beast killed it.

264
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,660
-野兽在这发现了她  -并把她带走了
- Found her here. - And probably took her.

265
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,610
-我们还有机会  -贝奥武夫
- There's a chance. - Beowulf.

266
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,960
-解决了他们  -哇 哇 我
- Finish them. - Oi, oi, me?

267
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,890
我和他不熟
I hardly know him.

268
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,730
赫罗斯加会为你感到骄傲
Hrothgar would be proud

269
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,930
让别人来替你杀生
Getting others to do your killing for you.

270
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,690
你只跟我们一起住了一年  你对我父亲又了解什么
One year you lived with us. What do you know of my father?

271
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,380
那就来杀我吧  我都不会挑起一场打斗
Come on, then. I won't even put up a fight.

272
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,330
你以为我有那么怕你么
Or do I scare you that much?

273
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,530
如果这是你想要的死法
If that's how you want it.

274
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,580
他有刀
He's got a knife!

275
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,290
如果你们拿着武器再靠近我一点 他就会死
Before you get close enough to use those, he'll be dead.

276
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,340
动手吧
Do it!

277
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,210
-愤怒让你成为一个男人 -我已经不是你认识的那个小男孩了
- Anger makes a man of you.  - I'm not the boy you knew.

278
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,260
不是么
No?

279
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,400
你们想救他吗 来呀
You want him? Be my guest.

280
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,880
然后回去向他母亲解释发生了什么
Then go and explain to his mother what happened.

281
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,980
我们走
Let's go!

282
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,460
快点
Come on!

283
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,650
别告诉我你是为了这个女孩
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

284
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,180
不只是她  我答应替拜仁报仇的
Not just her. I pledged to avenge Bayen.

285
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,930
他都死了  还有什么意义呢
He's dead. What's it matter?

286
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,450
这有更多的脚印 而且更深
More tracks. Deeper.

287
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,570
野兽把她带走了
It's carrying her.

288
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,060
朝这个方向
This way.

289
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,210
人们是如何让巨兽建造如此雄伟的建筑的
How did men drive giants from these lands?

290
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,220
在我到来之前
Before my time.

291
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,140
我听说巨兽吃婴儿
I heard giants ate human babies.

292
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,540
-女人们编造的  -你不害怕吗
- Wives' tales.  - You're not scared?

293
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,820
那是什么
What was that?

294
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,300
来
Come on.

295
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,210
你闻到了吗
Do you smell that?

296
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,380
别动
Don't move.

297
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,340
爱尔维纳
Elvina!

298
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,080
嘿 嘿 这边
Hey! Hey!

299
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,780
小心
Look out!

300
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,860
啊
Agh!

301
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,220
呀啊
Yaaagh!

302
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,820
他怎么样了
How is he?!

303
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,540
我猜明天才能知道了
Doubt I'll see morning.

304
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,130
他会活下来的
He'll live.

305
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,500
利拉 我的寡妇
Lila? My widow.

306
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,180
你的丈夫相信 每一片乌云后面都有一片更黑暗的
Your husband believes every cloud has a darker one behind it.

307
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,560
闭上嘴你会怀孕吗
There's nothing more you can do here.

308
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,300
给你 能做到吗
There. Can you?

309
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,650
-你要去哪  -拜仁的尸体得收拾好
- Where are you going?  - Bayen's body must be prepared.

310
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,170
他死了 那我呢
He's dead. What about me?

311
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,380
奥 疼
Aw.

312
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,010
这是从杀死拜仁的泥巴种身上砍下来的
Cut from the mud-born that killed Bayen.

313
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,540
不是我看到过的那些身上的
Not from any I've seen.

314
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:11,620
在它来这之前 这野兽在北方路上屠杀了很多佃农
Before it came here, the beast had been slaughtering crofters on the Northern Road.

315
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,100
很好的故事 但是什么都证明不了
A pretty story. But it proves nothing.

316
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,210
贝奥武夫救了爱尔维纳的命 回到了这里
Beowulf saved Elvina's life and returned here.

317
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,250
这倒能说明点什么
That proves something.

318
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,700
只能证明他喜欢她
Only that he wants her.

319
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,100
你应该好好看看赫罗斯加的尸体
You may look upon Hrothgar's body.

320
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,860
然后请你离开
Then you will go.

321
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,570
本来应该是我救你的
It should've been me that saved you.

322
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,250
你已经救过我了 很多次
You already have. Many times.

323
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,530
我本来会把那野兽的脑袋砍下来
I'd have cut the beast's head off.

324
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,250
我很庆幸不是你砍的
Then I'm glad it wasn't you.

325
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,460
今晚见
See you tonight?

326
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,820
你找到玫瑰水了吗
Did you find the rosewater?

327
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,180
我来帮你
Let me help.

328
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,460
这是什么
What is it?

329
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,770
担心我会偷东西
Worried I might steal something?

330
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,090
如果你偷了我会知道的
If you did, I'd know.

331
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,980
在这座房子里 对于我来说没有任何秘密
There are no secrets from me within this hall.

332
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,060
贝奥武夫
Beowulf.

333
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,900
这里一直会是你的家 贝奥武夫
This hall will always be your home, Beowulf.

334
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,900
史林是你同父异母的哥哥
Slean is your half-brother.

335
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,940
你是我的血脉
You're all my blood.

336
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,660
我的儿子
My son.

337
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,140
别人都不知道
Nobody else knows.

338
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,200
你不属于这里
You don't belong here.

339
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,660
从来都不属于
Never did.

340
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,900
鹿厅需要你
'Heorot will need you.'

341
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,900
你的兄弟也会需要你
Your brother will need you.

342
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,300
而你会来的
'And you will come.'

343
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,580
-你现在要干什么  -把我开始的事情做个了结
- What will you do now?  - Finish what I started.

344
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,610
-杀死泥巴种  -那不是杀死拜仁的野兽
- Kill the mud-born.  - It wasn't the beast that killed Bayen.

345
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:54,140
-你怎么知道的  -伤口不是野兽造成的 他是被刺死的
- How do you know?   - The wound wasn't inflicted by a beast. He was stabbed.

346
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,170
-拜仁在这里有敌人吗  -他是赫罗斯加的总管
- Bayen had enemies here?  - He was Hrothgar's reeve.

347
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,580
也是我的 所有鹿厅的军队都是他的
Mine, too. All of Heorot's enemies were his.

348
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,530
他有很多敌人
And there are many.

349
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,050
即使是在和平年代
Even in a time of peace.

350
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,660
好吧 不管是谁 我会找到他们
Well, whoever it was, I'll find them...

351
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,610
杀了他们
and kill them.

352
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,170
变脸怪
It's a skin-shifter!

353
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,690
人们害怕他们比害怕泥巴种还多
People fear skin-shifters more than other mud-born

354
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,130
因为它们可以生活在我们之中而不被发现
Because they can live amongst us undetected.

355
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,610
如果被发现了 就会发生恐慌
If word gets out, there will be panic.

356
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,970
-你能找到然后杀了吗  -如果它还在的话
- Can you find the thing and kill it?  - If it's still here.

357
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,770
十五年来我都是一个会走会说的死人
I've been a walking, talking dead man for 15 years.

358
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,810
-你怎么在这  -杀人的是泥巴种
- Why are you here? - The killer was mud-born.

359
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,860
你不会以为是我吧
You can't think it's me.
