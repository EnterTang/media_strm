00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,870
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.  THAT I'M A VAMPIRE.

(Mick) AFTER LAST TIME,  WHAT WITH THE INCINERATING...    UGH!

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:10,950
AND THE STAKES IN THE HEART,  I WASN'T SURE

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,660
IF I WAS   GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN. IT WAS A LOT TO PROCESS.

<i>IT'S HARD FOR ME</i>     <i>TO TRUST SOMEONE AGAIN.</i>

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,790
I KNOW WE DIDN'T EXACTLY GET OFF   ON THE RIGHT FOOT,

11
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,440
BUT I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS FROM BETH.   I'M GLAD THE BUZZ IS GOOD.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,820
(Josh) SHE ALSO SAID  IT'S NEVER BORING AROUND YOU.

YEAH,A LITTLE.

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,540
IT'S STRANGE THAT MICK    HASN'T EVEN STOPPED BY SINCE,

28
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,580
AT LEAST  TO SEE HOW YOU ARE.

29
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,300
I'M FINE.  IT'S JUST,FOR A WHILE, IT WAS LIKE HE WAS THERE

30
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,140
EVERY TIME WE OPENED THE DOOR,  AND NOW HE SORT OF DISAPPEARED.

200
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,850

I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. I'VE GOT  THIS WEIRD CASE I'M WORKING ON.

215
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,570
I'VE GOT A WINDOW  TO GET INTO THE MORGUE TONIGHT.

216
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,350
YOU'D RATHER BE AT THE MORGUE?

217
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,810
NO,NOT "RATHER."  IT'S JUST...

218
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,930
YOU KNOW,I CAN--I CAN PROBABLY GET IN TOMORROW MORNING.

219
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,580
NO,IT'S OKAY.

220
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,420
IF YOU HAVE TO,YOU HAVE TO.

221
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,030
THANK YOU FOR BEING SO UNDERSTANDING.

222
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,370
YEAH,    I'M SO UNDERSTANDING.

223
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,010
OKAY,YOU'RE MAD.

224
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,310
I'M NOT MAD.

225
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,900
WELL,YOU'RE SOMETHING.

226
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,090
LOOK,YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,    IT'S PRETTY RUDE.

227
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
THOSE ARE YOUR FRIENDS   IN THERE.

228
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,010
NOW YOU INVITE THEM HERE, AND THEN HE CALLS,AND YOU BAIL.

229
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,650
WHO CALLS?

230
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,940
MICK ST. JOHN.   THAT WASN'T MICK ST. JOHN.

231
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,150
THAT WAS A CONTACT    I HAVE AT THE MORGUE.

232
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,410
WELL,WHAT WOULD YOU    HAVE THOUGHT?

233
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,890
I SAW THE WAY YOU TWO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER

234
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,500
WHEN WE BUMPED INTO HIM.  OH,FOR GOODNESS SAKES.

235
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,560
HONESTLY, I COULDN'T MISS IT.

236
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,280
NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME   TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.

237
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,960
NOT THE RIGHT TIME? IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.

238
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,100
ONE YEAR TOGETHER,

239
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,620
AND I COOKED THE CHICKEN FOR YOU. YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE.

240
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,050
I SAID I'LL BE BACK   AS SOON AS I CAN.

241
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,900
(scoffs) YOU KNOW WHAT? TAKE YOUR TIME.

242
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,460
<i>NORMALLY,VAMPIRES DON'T HAVE</i>  <i>TO FREQUENT WOMEN IN THE TRADE.</i>

243
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,210

255
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,060
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

256
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,860
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

257
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,920
I'LL KNOW WHEN I SEE IT.

258
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,250
WHY HAVEN'T THEY IDENTIFIED HER?

259
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,840
MM. THEY HAVE,KIND OF.   NOT ACCORDING TO THIS.

260
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,190
WELL,SHE HAD ONE OF THOSE STRIPPER NAMES,YOU KNOW.

261
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,160
WE GIVE HER "JANE DOE" UNTIL WE FIND OUT WHO SHE REALLY IS.

262
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,960
OH,MY GOD. HE DID THIS?

263
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,220
YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY? HEY,YOU PAY ME 50 BUCKS TO SEE A DEAD GIRL NAKED.

264
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,140
I ASSUME YOU'RE UP   FOR ANYTHING.

265
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,970
YOU'RE SICK.    DO YOU KNOW THAT?

266
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,100
(elevator bell dings) (whispers) SHH. IT'S MY BOSS.

267
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,990
????

268
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,480
YOU SURE YOU WANT    TO DO THIS?

269
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,230
WE HAVE TO KNOW.

270
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,930
OKAY.

271
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,060
I'M SORRY.

272
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,240
(voice breaks)  IT'S NOT HER.

273
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,230
IT'S NOT HER.

274
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,370
EVERYBODY'S GONE NOW. YOU CAN GET UP.

275
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,050
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

276
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,490
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK YOU    THE SAME THING.  NO,THE PERSON HIDING AROUND THE CORNER

277
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,060
IN THE OTHER ROOM GETS TO GO FIRST.

278
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,590
THERE IS A SEXUAL PREDATOR  ON THE LOOSE.

279
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,920
I DON'T KNOW IF "SEXUAL"   IS THE RIGHT WORD,

280
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,360
BUT THERE WAS RUMORS   ABOUT AN ODD M.O. A BITER?

281
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,750
THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I DON'T MEAN TO CAST ASPERSIONS,

282
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,880
BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE A,UH...

283
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,440
IT'S A VAMPIRE-- AN EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED

284
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,660
AND DANGEROUS ONE.

285
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,530
SO YOUR TURN.

286
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,910
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

287
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,760
YOU TRACKING THE SAME GUY?   NO,I'M LOOKING FOR A MISSING GIRL--

288
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,070
THE DAUGHTER OF THAT COUPLE I WAS WITH.

289
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,380
SHE'S WORKING AS AN ESCORT. NOT THIS ESCORT?

290
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,850
NO. THEY SAID THAT THIS IS THE GIRL

291
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,270
THAT THEIR DAUGHTER CAME TO L.A. WITH AFTER HIGH SCHOOL.

292
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,350
THEY WERE ROOMMATES,   I GUESS.    SO WAIT A SECOND. YOU BROUGHT  THOSE PEOPLE HERE,

293
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,440
THINKING THEY WERE GONNA SEE THEIR DEAD DAUGHTER? FIRST,I WENT TO A CONDO, THINKING I'D FIND

294
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,880
THEIR LIVE DAUGHTER,BUT THAT HAPPENED TO BE A CRIME SCENE.   WHICH CRIME SCENE?

295
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,260
WILSHIRE CORRIDOR,87--  18?

296
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,730
YEAH.  THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP HERE,  TOO.

297
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,490
I'M FREEZING.   LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

298
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,140
OKAY,   I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT.

299
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,680
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD,

300
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,410
US RUNNING    INTO EACH OTHER HERE? NOT REALLY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

301
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,660
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN AVOIDING ME.

302
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,070
NO,I HAVEN'T.

303
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,810
YES,YOU HAVE.    EVER SINCE...

304
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,600
YOU KNOW,THE DESERT,

305
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,670
YOU'VE BEEN DODGING MY CALLS,    AVOIDING ME,

306
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,580
AND THEN WE RUN   INTO EACH OTHER TWICE,

307
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,680
FIRST DOWNTOWN AND NOW HERE.   FOLLOWING

308
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,700
TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PATHS,   WE END UP IN THE SAME PLACE.

309
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,560
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S A LITTLE STRANGE? YOU KNOW WHAT?

310
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,820
I'M NOT BIG ON CATEGORIZING THINGS INTO STRANGE AND NOT.

311
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,700
(whispering) WOW. VAMPIRES    MAKE REALLY BAD LIARS.

312
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,790
GO ON. ADMIT IT.

313
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,720
I JUST DON'T THINK WE NEED TO MAKE THIS INTO A BIG DEAL.

314
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,300
IT IS A BIG DEAL.   I FED YOU.

315
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,520
YOU WERE DYING OUT THERE,

316
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,750
AND I BROUGHT YOU BACK TO LIFE  WITH MY BLOOD.

317
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,300
<i>WITH MY BLOOD.</i>

318
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,000
MICK,NOW WE'RE HERE,  TOGETHER.

319
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,790
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

320
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,380
HUH? WHAT--WHAT DO YOU    WANT ME TO SAY?

321
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,060
I WANT YOU TO ADMIT THAT  SOMETHING HAPPENED BETWEEN US.

322
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,880
OKAY.

323
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,740
(whispering) OKAY,SOMETHING HAPPENED.

324
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,220
IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY IT   LIKE THAT...

325
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,550
SO WHAT IF I CALLED YOU BACK,    HUH? WHAT THEN?

326
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,820
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?   YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I'M A VAMPIRE,RIGHT?

327
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,580
YEAH. AND DON'T YOU HAVE SOME DINNER  THAT YOU'RE GIVING?

328
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,960
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT    I'M HERE,AND SO ARE YOU,

329
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,870
AND THERE MUST BE A REASON.

330
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,250
HELP ME TRACK THE KILLER,AND I    THINK YOU'LL FIND THE GIRL.

331
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,780
YEAH?

332
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,860
(man) Hi,Cherish.

333
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,720
WHO IS THIS?

334
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,950
I'M A FRIEND OF YOUR OLD ROOMMATE.

335
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,680
Huh. How is she?

336
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,310
GOOD. NEVER BETTER.

337
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,510
SHE SAYS HI.

338
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,910
Really?

339
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,980
'CAUSE WE KINDA HAD A FALLING OUT

340
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,460
AFTER SHE SWIPED MY OLD WEB SITE.

341
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,310
YEAH, SHE'S SORRY ABOUT THAT.

342
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,910
SHE SAID I SHOULD GIVE YOU A CALL.

343
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,930
LOOK,I'M PRIVATE NOW.

344
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,010
NOT REALLY INTO EXPANDING  MY CIRCLE OF FRIENDS.

345
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,590
I COULD OFFER A SUBSTANTIAL DONATION.

346
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,650
500 ROSES?

347
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,000
OKAY.

348
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,510
Per hour?

349
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,020
FINE.

350
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,790
AND YOU'RE SURE NATALIE WON'T GET ALL SKEEZY ABOUT THIS?

351
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,210
I PROMISE YOU, SHE WON'T SAY ANYTHING.

352
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,580
YOU'D THINK BY NOW YOU'D KNOW  HOW TO SPELL "PREDATOR."

353
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,930
MARISSA.

354
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,050
SO WAS THE MORGUE    EXCITING?

355
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,470
I'M SORRY I HAD TO BAIL.

356
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,980
DON'T APOLOGIZE TO ME. APOLOGIZE TO THE MAN WHO BURNED THE COQ.

357
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,170
IS HE MAD?

358
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,190
NO,NOT REALLY.

359
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,440
THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT.

360
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,510
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU TWO,ANYWAY?

361
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,030
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

362
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,270
YOU'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR A YEAR,

363
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,580
AND YET YOU'RE NOT EVEN    LIVING TOGETHER.

364
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,780
WE HAVE SLEEPOVERS.

365
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,950
EXACTLY. DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS?    I <i>AM</i> SERIOUS.

366
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,090
ABOUT STIFFS IN THE MORGUE.

367
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,010
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?  NO.

368
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,460
REALLY?    NO.

369
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,300
NO. WHERE--WHERE IS THIS    COMING FROM ANYWAY?

370
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,040
I THOUGHT YOU SAID  JOSH AND I WERE FATED.

371
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,510
FATE'S FINE, BUT AT SOME POINT,

372
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,450
THE HUMAN'S GOTTA STEP IN    AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.

373
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,070
FATE'S NOT GONNA GET THE EXTRA KEYS MADE

374
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,690
AND MOVE YOUR STUFF INTO HIS APARTMENT.

375
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,070
I MEAN, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

376
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,190
THE UNIVERSE SENDS YOU A SIGN,    AND YOU JUST...    (cell phone rings)

377
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,680
YOU SEE? THAT'S A SIGN,

378
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,670
BUT YOU GOTTA ANSWER  THE CALL.   (ring)

379
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,460
IT'S NOT JOSH.

380
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,560

383
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,180
NOT SURE HOW THE OTHERS FARED,

384
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,820
BUT THAT'S SEEMING UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT.

385
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,530

403
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,510
I'VE NEVER SPOKEN   TO A SERIAL KILLER BEFORE.

404
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,210
OH,YOU KNOW,BE POLITE. YOU KNOW,"PLEASE," "THANK YOU."

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,940

00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,540
IT'S ME--JAZZMYN.

412
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,060
Oh,you.

413
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,230
SO,UH,I WAS THINKING...

414
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,530
What? Wh were you thinking?

415
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,370
YOU KNOW.

416
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,040
No,I don't know, you idiot whorebag.

417
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,510
I told you never to call me here. (click)

418
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,700
I MESSED UP. NO,YOU DIDN'T.

419
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,940
I RUINED IT.  YOU DIDN'T. IT'S FINE.  IT'S NOT HIM.

420
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,830
(Mick) HE THINKS SHE'S ALIVE.

421
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,260
HE'S NOT WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR,  REALLY. YOU WERE,UH,

422

CHERISH?

429
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,560
(whispers) CHERISH?

430
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,260
Is that--is that you?    Are you there?

431
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,160
YEAH,I'M HERE.   WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE?

432
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,640
STILL ON FOR TODAY,RIGHT? Can't wait.

433
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,420
THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING YOU. Good.

434
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,440
I'M REALLY GLAD.

435
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,080
YOU SEEM REALLY NICE.

436
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,060
We're gonna have a blast.

437
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,130
So...

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,670

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,040
THAT'S WEIRD.

442
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,550
KIND OF REMINDED ME    OF HIGH SCHOOL.

443
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,940
SOUNDS LIKE HE WANTS  A GIRLFRIEND,NOT A HOOKER.

444
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,320
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE GREENIES IS? I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT.

445
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,060
I'LL POKE AROUND.

446
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,880
MEANWHILE,CALL WAS TRACED TO A LANDLINE.

447
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,950
1730 LOS FELIZ.

448
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:54,430
IF THE PLAN IS FOR TODAY, YOU MIGHT WANNA HURRY.

449
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,390
LET'S GO.

450
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,620
SO YOUR FRIENDS-- ARE THEY,UM...

451
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,540

452
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,950
YOU KNOW.

453
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,170
VAMPIRES?

454
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,120
CAN'T TELL,CAN YOU?

455
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,740
SCARY.

456
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,620
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE--

457
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,450
SHH.

458
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,520
(woman) GET YOUR HANDS UP!    TURN AROUND. TURN AROUND.

459
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,950
LET THEM GO!    PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD.

460
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,520
NOW!

461
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,520
ALL RIGHT,ALL RIGHT.

462
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:12,120
<i>(man) * SHE'S PARANOID</i>   <i>WITH A BODY DIZZY *</i>

463
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:18,770
<i>* HER EYEBROWS MELTED</i>     <i>INTO HER FACE *</i>

464
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,770
CHERISH?

<i>* GOT TO GET ME</i>   <i>OUT OF THIS PLACE *</i>

466
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,400
SURE. WHY NOT?

467
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,450
FINALLY,IT'S YOU.

468
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,350
I SAW YOUR PICTURE.

469
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,050
JUST SIT DOWN,OKAY?

470
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,900
UH,YOU KNOW WHAT?

471
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,520
CAN YOU GET ME A DOUBLE?

472
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,070
MICK ST. JOHN.

473
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,810
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW CLOSE  YOU CAME TO GETTING SHOT?

474
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,050
<i>DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA</i>    <i>HOW CLOSE YOU CAME</i>

475
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,500
<i>TO GETTING</i>  <i>YOUR FACE RIPPED OFF?</i>

476
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,070
<i>I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT IS</i>    <i>ABOUT HUMANS AND YELLING.</i>

477
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,490
<i>NOT THAT I DON'T APPRECIATE</i>

478
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,250
<i>THAT FLUSHED,</i>  <i>BLOOD-IN-THE-FACE LOOK</i>

479
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,200
<i>MORE THAN I USED TO,</i>  <i>BACK BEFORE I BECAME A VAMPIRE.</i>

480
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,840
<i>IT'S JUST THAT WHATEVER RELIEF</i>

481
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,190

483
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,730
(Carl) WHAT'S THAT?

484
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,340
I DON'T KNOW. LOOKS LIKE SOME OLD PHOTO.

485
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,110
LOOKS LIKE OLD HOOKERS  OR SOMETHING.

486
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,520
COULD WE JUST STICK   TO THE CASE HERE,

487
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,590
NOT WASTE TIME ON SOME STUPID-ASS PICTURE?

488
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,090
THE FEDS    HAVE THIS GUY NAILED.

489
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,310
HE'S A LONER,  38 TO 45 YEARS OLD,

490
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,170
TORTURED ANIMALS AS A CHILD,    WET HIS BED.

491
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,600
THAT FREEZER?

492
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,520
IT'S A PLACE TO KEEP TROPHIES   OF HIS VICTIMS.

493
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,410
????38,HUH?

494
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,650
IT'S 38 <i>TO</i> 45.

495
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,870
PROFILING'S    NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE.

496
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,320
I'LL SAY.

497
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,510
THEY SAID WE CAN GO.

498
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,770
HE'S A KID,  MAYBE 16 YEARS OLD.

499
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,050
16?

500
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,190
WELL,GOING ON 200.   I SAW A PICTURE.

501
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,880
UGH,AWKWARD AGE.

502
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:37,610
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

503
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,370
YOU KNOW,BOYS THAT AGE THINK    ABOUT SEX 20 TIMES A MINUTE,

504
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,320
AND THAT'S  A SCIENTIFIC FACT?

505
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,690
TIMES TWO CENTURIES,    THAT'S GOTTA TAKE A TOLL. SHOULDN'T WE TELL THE POLICE?

506
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,730
WELL,HE'S A VAMPIRE.

507
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,420
IT'S PROBABLY HEALTHIER  ALL AROUND IF WE DON'T.

508
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,730
OH,MY GOD. NATALIE HALL.

509
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,510
THIS BELONGED  TO THE DEAD ESCORT.

510
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,300
JUST KEEP IT HIDDE UNTIL WE'RE IN THE CAR.

511
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,670
THEY'RE STILL WATCHING US.

512
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,520
LOOK.

513
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,890
THAT'S HER.

514
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,300
THAT'S THE GIRL I'M LOOKING FOR.

515
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,620
YOU THINK HE'S WITH HER?   THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE.

516
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,860
GREENIE'S? THERE'S A NUMBER ON THE BACK.

517
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,120
CALL IT.

518
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,770
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?    YOU A VIRGIN?

519
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,710
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN.

520
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,300
I MEAN, WOULD I BE YOUR FIRST?

521
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,970
MY FIRST?

522
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,710
NOT REALLY.

523
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,210
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

524
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,110
I SAID.

525
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,670
21,SURE.

526
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,090
I MEAN,REALLY.

527
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,970
REALLY?

528
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,150
197 1/2.

529
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,870
LOOK, YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE KID.

530
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,390
ARE YOU SURE THAT...

531
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,180
HEY. DON'T ANSWER IT.

532
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,840
OKAY,OKAY. JUST...

533
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,750
UGH. IT WENT TO VOICE MAIL.

534
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,470
IT'S A PUBLIC PLACE  AT A CROWDED PIER.

535
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,630
SHE SHOULD BE OKAY  UNTIL WE GET THERE.

536
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,010
HOW FAR IS IT ANYWAY?

537
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,980
IT'S JUST AT THE BEACH.    WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

538
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,560
SO WE CAN GO    ON THE RIDES,

539
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,390
PLAY SOME GAMES.

540
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,220
RIDES?

541
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,620
YEAH,THE ROLLER COASTER'S KILLER. YOU'LL LOVE IT.

542
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,440
I DON'T HAVE TIME   FOR ALL THAT.

543
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,130
COME HERE.

544
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,990
YOU CAN WAIT.

545
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,930
I WANT YOU CLOSER.

546
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,000
SO HOW DOES IT WORK,   ANYWAY?

547
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,050
WHAT?

548
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,280
JUST,YOU KNOW, THE SEX THING.

549
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
YOUR PARENTS  NEVER TOLD YOU?

550
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,440
THEY SOMEHOW SKIPPED THE PART  INVOLVING VAMPIRES.

551
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,850
OH.

552
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,540
VAMPIRES AND HUMANS,   I MEAN.

553
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,170
OH,I'M TALKING TOTALLY HYPOTHETICALLY,BELIEVE ME.

554
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,070
KISS ME.

555
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,900
LIKE YOU MEAN IT.

556
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,800
YOU WANNA KNOW    HOW IT WORKS?

557
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,810
IT DOESN'T,OKAY?    IT DOESN'T WORK.

558
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,060
SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE?

559
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,940
IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.   IT'S INADVISABLE.

560
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,190
IT NEVER ENDS WELL.

561
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,610
NEVER?

562
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,860
WE'RE ALMOST THERE. YOU SHOULD CHECK THAT NUMBER AGAIN.

563
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,130
OKAY.

564
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,070
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST CALM DOWN.

565
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,530
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE YOU SHOULD   JUST DO WHAT YOU'RE PAID FOR.    (cell phone rings)

566
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,760
(scoffs) I'M OUT OF HERE.  DO NOT ANSWER THAT.

567
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,660
YEAH? UGH! (grunts)

568
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,460

569
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,950
DO YOU HAVE HER?

570
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,710
????

571
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,130
I CAN'T TELL. LISTEN.

572
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,370
(whispers)  NOW GIVE ME THE PHONE.

573

????

576
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,630
(Mick) I know what you are.  I know why you're doing this.

577
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,080
THE BORDELLO. IS THAT IT?

578
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,870
WHO TURNED YOU?

579
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,830
What did they do?  Are you there?

580
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:49,230
LET HER GO. I KNOW YOU WANT TO.   Who are you?

581
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,110
WHO ARE YOU?

582
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,430
My name is Mick St. John.

583
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,780
I know you're a vampire...

584
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,260
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS NUMBER?

585
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,090
????

586
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:58,960
Like me.

587
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,140
OH,LIKE YOU,HUH?

588
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,240
I KNOW WHAT  YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. Oh,you know?

589
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,030
IS THAT RIGHT?   I know that you feel cursed,

590
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,890
like fate has played  a cruel trick on you,

591
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,390
li you're gonna wake up   one day and realize

592
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,540
THIS WAS ALL A MISTAKE, BUT YOU DON'T WAKE UP,

593
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,800
not as the years roll by,  the decades--

594
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,730
CENTURIES,MICK.   200 YEARS.

595
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:20,330
I didn't choose any of this.  It was done to me.   YOU CAN ALWAYS CHOOSE.

596
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,310
(scoffs) SURE.

597
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,600
LET GO OF ME.

598
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,210
LET ME GO!

599
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,350
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

600
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,180
????

601
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,870
WAIT,WAIT,WAIT,WAIT.

602
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,890
LEAVE ME ALONE.

603
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,770
(crying)  THAT GUY WAS GONNA KILL ME.

604
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,830
(Mick) IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.

605
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,650
I KNOW   WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

606
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,230
????

607
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,220
you???

608
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,470
YOU THINK SO?

609
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,100
YOU THINK YOU KNOW?

610
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,540
COULDN'T POSSIBLY.

611
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,080
I MEAN,YOU WERE TURNED  AT WHAT,30?

612
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,770
I'M STUCK.

613
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,640
ALL I'VE EVER WANTED IS  TO GROW OUT OF THIS,

614
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,020
AND I WON'T... EVER.

615
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,180
SOMEONE BETRAYED YOU.

616
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,250
OH,YOU THINK?

617
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,340
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.

618
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,680
HAVE YOU EVER LOVED SOMEONE   COMPLETELY?

619
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,590
SO THAT SHE WAS    YOUR WHOLE WORLD?

620
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:54,260
YOU'D DO ANYTHING SHE ASKED,    ANYTHING AT ALL.

621
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,720
HAVE YOU EVER LOVED SOMEONE    THAT WAY?

622
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,950
SO YOU FORGOT ABOUT YOURSELF

623
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,710
AND ALL YOU THOUGHT ABOUT    WAS HER?

624
