2
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:08,291
那些声音都在你的脑子里
肯定很难受吧
It must be very difficult havingall those voices inside one head.

3
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:12,791
史蒂文·格兰特 马克·斯佩克特 孔苏
Marc Spector. Steven Grant. Khonshu.

4
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,083
还给我 你这个蠢货
Give it back, you fool.

5
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,750
前情提要

6
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,166
你能听见他说话吗？

7
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,375
现在听不见了 我曾经是他的化身
Not anymore.I was his former Avatar.

8
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:27,208
孔苏惩罚那些已经犯下罪行的人
Khonshu punishes thosewho have already walked an evil path.

9
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,708
他的惩罚来得太晚了
His retribution comes too late.

10
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,500
阿米特是从根源上铲除邪恶
Ammit tears evil up from the root.

11
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,500
真希望你能活着看到我们创造的世界
I wish you could liveto see the world we make.

12
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,833
但是阿米特已经做出了裁决
Yet, Ammit has decided.

13
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,708
你无需怀疑她的审判
You don't need to doubt her judgment.

14
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,625
阿米特会照亮向善的路途
Ammit will light the path to good.

15
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,458
我们必须要让她复活
We must resurrect her.

16
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,208
史蒂文 我和孔苏有约定
Steven, I made a deal with Khonshu.

17
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,708
那个约定的前提是你不能干涉
That deal is contingenton you not interfering.

18
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,916
现在把身体交给我
Now, give me the body.

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,583
圣甲虫的作用就是罗盘
That scarab functionsas a kind of compass,

20
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,958
指引我们找到阿米特的墓穴
leading us to Ammit's tomb.

21
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,250
召唤战服
Summon the suit!

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,458
不 它去哪了？该死

23
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,458
我们会找到圣甲虫的
We'll find the scarab.

24
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,250
太晚了 哈罗已经得手了
Too late. Harrow has it.

25
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:17,125
那我们再想其它办法
我们会比他先找到阿米特的墓穴
Then we'll find another way.We'll get to Ammit's tomb first.

26
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,250
然后我就找到了他 还有圣甲虫
And then I found him, with the scarab,

27
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:32,250
离我们原来的家就20分钟距离
living 20 minutes from our old place.

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,375
他在开罗这么乱跑就是送死
Now, he's probably going to get himselfkilled running around Cairo.

29
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,791
这就是你不愿意回家的原因
That's why you look so unhappyto be going home.

30
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,208
可能是焦虑吧
Anxious, maybe.

31
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,416
已经十年了
It's been 10 years.

32
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,083
你就不怕没有回头路了吗？

33
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,041
你偷了那么多古董文物
All those stolen relicsand cheeky antiques?

34
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,666
我没有偷
I don't steal.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,500
那些本来就是赃物
They've already been stolen.

36
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,583
人们总是忽略这一点
That's what people forget.

37
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,250
我把它们从黑市里拿走
I take them off the black market

38
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,708
然后物归原主而已
and return them to their rightful owners.

39
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,083
当然我可能留下几个付生活费
I might keep a few to pay the bills.

40
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,083
你可真机灵
Clever you.

41
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,458
那个天真的小女孩不在了
Not so innocent anymore, eh?

42
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,416
不知道你爸爸看到你现在的样子会怎么想
I wonder what your father would thinkof his little scarab now?

43
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,708
这就永远不得而知了

44
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,833
我觉得他肯定不会让你教我这些
I can't believe he let you teach mehow to do all of this.

45
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,708
他可不是一般的溺爱

46
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,583
你觉得挖掘现场是小孩子该去的地方吗？
You think his dig siteswere any place for a child?

47
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:02,250
考古学就是一群书呆子搞的烂摊子
Archeology. One big messof obsessive bookworms.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,875
那片沙漠里的过往 就让它随风而去吧
Whatever happened in that desertis lost to the sands.

49
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:13,250
回忆过去的痛苦太难受了
It's a hard thing,exhuming the pain of the past.

50
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,166
很容易想不开

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,750
没完没了地回忆受过的伤害
Fixate on what's hurt us.

52
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,125
好吧 我不会的
Great. Then I won't do either.

53
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,791
说得和真的似的
Like you aren't already.

54
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,875
我也很想念他
I miss him, too, is all.

55
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,375
但是那是你的事 不是我的
But that's your baggage, not mine.

56
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:38,041
尽量远离过去的困扰吧

57
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:39,833
也许我想多了…

58
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:40,958
埃及阿拉伯共和国

59
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,125
但是我就是担心你

60
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,208
旅途愉快 亲爱的
Have a good trip, love.

61
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,125
谢谢

62
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,083
我们找到阿米特了
We found Ammit.

63
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,375
她在这里
She's here.

64
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,416
我们找到她了

65
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,125
她在这
She's here.

66
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,625
马克·斯佩克特来开罗了
Marc Spector's in Cairo.

67
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,291
他在追踪我们
He's tracking us.

68
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,416
我知道 她在这里
I know. She's here.

69
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:55,958
该死

70
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,375
你杀了他？

71
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,083
我本来要和那家伙谈谈的
I needed to talk to that guy.

72
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,666
关于挖掘现场的事
About a dig site.

73
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,750
看来我只能问问你了
Guess I'm gonna have totalk to you instead.

74
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,291
你来晚了

75
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,166
-你永远别想找到哈罗
-真的吗？
- You're never gonna find Harrow.- Really?

76
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,041
咱们是要跳舞吗？还是打架？
咱们到底要干什么？

77
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,583
去死吧 美国佬

78
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,125
不 马克

79
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,125
别这么做 马克
Don't do it, Marc.

80
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,083
住手

81
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,041
住手

82
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,500
史蒂文呢？
Where's Steven?

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,333
停车

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,166
你会说阿拉伯语啊？

85
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,416
那你怎么像个外国人似的？

86
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,666
你要带我去哪？

87
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,250
你说要去机场的
You are said airport.

88
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:40,833
机场

89
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,708
等等 停车 快点停车
Wait, wait, wait. Stop! Stop!Stop, stop! Stop, stop, stop!

90
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,416
我有话和你说
Let me talk to you.

91
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,875
放过我们吧 哥们
Just let us go, man.

92
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,125
刚才不是我 你听我说 就一会儿

93
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,041
我的钱！

94
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,458
我的钱！我的钱呢？

95
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,541
哈罗在哪？
Where's Harrow?

96
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,541
告诉我哈罗在哪
Where is Harrow? Tell me.

97
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,500
马克

98
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,916
马克 够了
Marc, that's enough.

99
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:07,875
怎么回事？

100
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,166
天啊
Oh, my God.

101
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,541
天啊

102
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,916
史蒂文 你干了什么？
Steven, what did you do?

103
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,250
我发誓 不是我干的
I swear. That wasn't me.

104
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,583
那是谁？
Then who was it?

105
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,750
墓穴在哪？

106
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,000
把他带到悬崖边上去
Take him to the ledge.

107
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:31,916
他只是个孩子

108
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,750
他会老实交代的
He'll talk.

109
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,583
哈罗在哪？
Where is Harrow?

110
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,208
哈罗在哪？

111
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,416
赞美阿米特

112
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,750
我还以为他会老实交代呢
I thought he'd talk.

113
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,500
你是怎么回事 史蒂文？
What the hell's wrong with you, Steven?

114
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,375
我？大开杀戒的可是你
Me? You're the onegoing on a killing spree.

115
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,666
这些不是我干的
I didn't do any of this.

116
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,833
也不是我 听着 要是你不想杀这么多人
Me neither. Listen, if you've gota problem with the body count,

117
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,291
就别再对那个破鸟唯命是从了
I suggest you stop listeningto that stupid pigeon.

118
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,333
少碍事
Stay out of my way.

119
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,750
如果咱们找不到哈罗的挖掘队
Well, if we can't findHarrow's digging crew,

120
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,666
只能换个方法阻止他了

121
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,291
怎么办？其他的神呢？
So? What about the other gods?

122
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,625
有人要释放阿米特 他们就坐视不管吗？
Are they just gonna stand byand allow somebody to unleash Ammit?

123
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:47,166
召唤众神前来 可能招致他们的狂怒
To signal for an audiencewith the gods is to risk their wrath.

124
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,375
为什么？结果还能有多糟糕？
Why? What's the worst that could happen?

125
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,791
激怒了他们 我可能会被囚禁起来
Anger them enoughand they'll imprison me in stone.

126
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,750
我觉得这倒不是什么坏事
That doesn't sound so bad to me.

127
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,958
真的吗？没有我的治愈盔甲的庇护
See how you fare against Harrow

128
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,000
看你怎么跟哈罗斗
without the protectionof my healing armor.

129
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,083
好吧 那怎么办？
All right. So, what?

130
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,250
你有什么好主意吗？
Do you have any good ideas?

131
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,500
我倒是有个不怎么样的主意
I have a bad one.

132
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,708
孔苏？
Khonshu?

133
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,500
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

134
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,500
向众神发出信号 他们别想假装看不见
Sending the godsa signal they can't ignore.

135
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:46,875
救命

136
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,791
看来你走投无路了 老朋友
You're getting desperate, old bird.

137
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:56,291
继续挖 无论发生什么都要继续挖
Keep digging!No matter what happens, keep digging!

138
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:02,125
不要停 我就要被召唤了
Do not stop. I'm about to be called upon.

139
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,333
你不觉得这有点过分了吗？
That was a bit over the top,don't you think?

140
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,833
快点 他们的化身开始集结了
Hurry.They're gathering their Avatars now.

141
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,833
难道他们不是在世界各地吗？
Aren't they scattered all over the world?

142
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,541
是的 但是如果九柱神需要会面
Yes.But for a meeting of the Ennead,

143
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:16,041
传送门会随时出现
a portal presents itself anywhere.

144
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,541
好吧 那我的传送门在哪里？
Okay. So, where's mine?

145
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:28,833
上次和众神对话的时候 他们驱逐了我
The last time I spoketo the gods, they banished me.

146
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:32,750
我们对哈罗的指控必须无懈可击
Our case against Harrowmust be indisputable.

147
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,833
你不一起来吗？
Aren't you coming with?

148
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,166
我会去的

149
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,500
我们进来了
I can't believe it.

150
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,333
天啊 我们进来了
Oh, my days. We're inside.

151
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,250
我们在吉萨大金字塔的里面
We're inside the Great Pyramid of Giza.

152
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,333
孔苏的戏法真是无与伦比
Khonshu's theatrics are unparalleled.

153
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,291
你是他的化身吧
You must be his Avatar.

154
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,666
你好 你是谁？
Hi. And who are you?

155
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,000
我是亚齐尔 哈托尔的化身

156
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:48,958
哦

157
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,666
音乐和爱的女神？
Goddess of music and love?

158
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:51,958
厉害

159
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,791
孔苏肯定提过她吧？

160
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,166
他不太喜欢聊众神的事
The gods aren't really his favorite topic.

161
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,125
即便他们是老朋友？
Not even when they are old friends?

162
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,291
抱歉

163
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:07,625
她说不久之前
孔苏还很喜欢哈托尔的旋律呢

164
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,500
据我所知 孔苏唯一喜欢的旋律
就是痛苦的哀嚎
Well, as far as I know, the only melodyKhonshu enjoys is the sound of pain.

165
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:13,875
亚齐尔
Yatzil.

166
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,000
孔苏告诉你这里的规矩了吗？
Has Khonshu told you how this works?

167
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,208
没有 有什么我需要注意的吗？
Not really.Is there somethin' I should know?

168
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,541
我尽量遵守规矩

169
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,791
感觉会有些奇怪 但是你会适应的
It's a strange sensation.But you'll get used to it.

170
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,708
好吧

171
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:46,833
出席者为荷鲁斯 伊西斯 泰芙努特
In attendance, Horus, Isis, Tefnut,

172
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,083
欧西里斯和哈托尔
Osiris and Hathor,

173
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,166
前来聆听孔苏的陈词
to hear the account of Khonshu.

174
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,291
你因为差点暴露我们
已经被放逐过一次了 孔苏
You've been banished oncefor nearly exposing us, Khonshu.

175
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,916
你知道我们鄙视你的媚俗
And you know we despise your garishness,

176
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,000
还有你花里胡哨的面具和武器
your showy masks, and weapons.

177
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,458
但是如果你胆敢再次操控天空
But manipulate the sky again

178
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,583
我们就把你永远囚禁起来
and we will imprison you in stone.

179
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,750
少拿你们自以为是的那一套吓唬我
Spare meyour self-righteous threats!

180
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,291
我被放逐的原因是不放弃人类
I was banishedfor not abandoning humanity,

181
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,000
和你们不一样
unlike the rest of you.

182
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,625
我们没有放弃人类
We have not abandoned humanity.

183
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,750
是人类放弃了我们
They abandoned us.

184
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,958
我们只是让化身去开展我们的目标
We simply trust our Avatarsto carry out our purposes

185
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,583
不给自己招惹无谓的麻烦
without calling undue attentionto ourselves.

186
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,208
和某人不一样
Not like some of us.

187
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:37,333
化身的力量是有限的
我们需要众神的力量
Avatars are not enough!We need the might of gods.

188
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,125
不要沉溺于虚空之境的富足了
你们的王国快要被颠覆了
Return from the opulence of the Overvoidbefore you lose this realm.

189
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,166
再说最后一次 孔苏…
For the last time, Khonshu...

190
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:50,291
化身的唯一目的就是观察
The Avatars that remain hereare simply meant to observe.

191
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,041
我们很早以前就决定了 我们不会插手
We decided long agowe did not wish to meddle

192
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,708
人类的事务
in the affairs of man.

193
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,666
我们会作出最合适的决定
We will decide our best course of action.

194
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,791
说出你的目的
Speak your purpose.

195
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,958
我要求审判亚瑟·哈罗
I call for judgment against Arthur Harrow.

196
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,750
罪名是？
The charges?

197
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,500
密谋释放阿米特
Conspiracy to release Ammit!

198
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,458
这可是个严重的指控 孔苏
That is a heavy accusation, Khonshu.

199
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,458
传唤被告
Let us summon the accused.

200
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:38,291
这不是孔苏化身的临时替代品嘛
So, I see by the presenceof Khonshu's current makeshift Avatar,

201
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,666
这次会议的目的肯定很邪恶
the purposes of our meetingmust be nefarious.

202
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,000
我们为什么在这里你心知肚明
You know exactly why we are here!

203
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,708
我必须得承认我一点都不怀念那个声音
I must admit I do not missthe sound of that voice.

204
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,916
但是我的老主人 说重点吧
But speak, old master, to the point.

205
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,708
你是不是试图从墓穴中释放阿米特？
Do you not seek to release Ammitfrom her tomb?

206
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,333
我在沙漠里
I was in the desert.

207
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,291
如果看沙子都是犯罪
But if visiting the sands were a crime,

208
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,833
那罪犯的队伍可要比尼罗河还长了
the line of sinnerswould be longer than the Nile.

209
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:08,791
自从他引诱我服侍他以后
Khonshu has searched for Ammit's tomb

210
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,583
孔苏一直在寻找阿米特的墓穴
since he ensnared me to his service.

211
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:15,833
他被嫉妒和偏执蒙蔽了双眼 他…
His vision is obscuredby jealousy, paranoia, and his...

212
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,125
他是个骗子
He is a deceiver!

213
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,875
你们不能听信这个有污点的神
Do not trust the word of a shamed god.

214
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,125
孔苏的精神错乱了
No, Khonshu is unhinged

215
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,583
他的仆人也不正常
and his servant unwell.

216
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,291
你是什么意思？
How do you mean?

217
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:36,750
这个人连他自己的名字都不知道

218
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,333
他的结婚证上的名字是马克·斯佩克特

219
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,250
骗子

220
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,375
工作记录上的名字是史蒂夫·格兰特

221
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,333
住口

222
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,208
-我还见过他自言自语…
-住口
- I've seen him speak to himself...- Shut up!

223
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,875
自己威胁自己

224
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,083
我不知道他到底有多少种人格
I have no idea how many personalitieshe must possess.

225
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,541
这个人就是个疯子
The man is clearly insane.

226
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,916
我们绝不容忍在这里出现暴力行为
We will not tolerate violencein this Chamber.

227
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,958
我很难过地告诉各位
It brings me no pleasure

228
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,625
这个人现在深陷困境
to tell youthat this is a deeply troubled man.

229
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,750
孔苏在利用他 就和他当时利用我一样
Khonshu is taking advantage of himthe same way that he abused me,

230
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,791
就和他意图利用这个法庭一样
the way he aspires to abuse this court.

231
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,291
趁着为时未晚 赶快采取行动吧
Take action now before it's too late.

232
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,500
我们要和马克·斯佩克特说话
Let us speak to Marc Spector.

233
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,458
你不舒服吗？
Are you unwell?

234
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,041
是 我是不舒服
I am. I am unwell.

235
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,416
我是需要帮助
I need help.

236
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,250
但是这并不能改变事实 这个人是个…
But that doesn't change the factthat this man is...

237
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:26,625
这里很安全 你可以大胆地告诉我们
你是不是感觉被孔苏利用了
This is a safe space for you to tell usif you feel exploited by Khonshu.

238
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:30,750
这和我的感觉没关系 我不是被告 他才是
This is not about my feelings!I'm not the one on trial here. He is!

239
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:35,250
你们听我说 这个人非常危险
This is about how dangerous he isif you would just listen for a second.

240
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,041
他并没有犯下任何罪行
He has committed no offense.

241
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,291
这件事可以结案了
This matter is concluded.

242
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,750
马克？还有其它办法
Marc? There is another way.

243
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,250
-你必须仔细听我说
-好的
- You must listen to me carefully.- Yes. Yes.

244
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:26,000
阿米特被埋葬在秘密的地方
连众神都不知道在哪
Ammit was buried in secret.The location hidden even from the gods.

245
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,958
阿米特有很多拥趸 我不知道能相信谁
Ammit had many followers.I didn't know who to trust.

246
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,541
但是肯定有人知道些什么
But someone had to know something.

247
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,666
有个人知道 一个名叫森夫的守卫者
One man. A medjay named Senfu.

248
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,041
他的任务就是记录墓穴的位置
He was tasked with recordingthe location of the tomb

249
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,625
以防众神某天改变心意大发慈悲
in case the gods ever changed their mindsand decided to show mercy.

250
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,416
找到森夫的石棺 你就能找到你要的墓穴
Find Senfu's sarcophagusand you'll find your tomb.

251
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,208
好吧 那我该怎么做？
Okay. How am I supposed to do that?

252
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,583
他的石棺被盗了 然后被卖到黑市去了
His sarcophagus was stolenand sold on the black market.

253
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,291
你可以从那里开始
You might want to start there.

254
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:06,916
我要一个
I'll take one.

255
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,791
很好 一个 先生
Perfect, one, sir.

256
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,041
这可是全世界最好的果汁
Best juice ever in the world.

257
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,041
我在寻找森夫的石棺
I'm looking for Senfu's sarcophagus.

258
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,041
森夫？
Senfu?

259
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,083
我注意到你了
I hope you like attention.

260
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,500
你找对了人 来对了地方 但是你不是埃及人
Right guy, right place.But you're not Egyptian.

261
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:37,375
莱拉 你在这干什么？你不该来这里的
Layla, what the hell are you doing here?You shouldn't be here.

262
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:41,333
为什么不行？因为开罗有人不爽我？
我才不在乎呢
Why? Because my name pisses offa few people in Cairo? Who cares?

263
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,541
我担心的可不是当地人
It's not the localsthat I'm worried about.

264
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,625
跟我来 我会帮你找到你要的东西
Come with me.I'll help you find what you need.

265
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,416
所以我们到底来这干什么？有什么计划？
So what exactly are we gonnado here? What's the plan?

266
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,833
被蒙在鼓里的滋味不好受吧？
It's not pleasantbeing left in the dark, is it?

267
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,458
好吧

268
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:09,750
我知道我匆匆忙忙离开了你
来了开罗 让你不高兴
I get that you're not happy about meleaving so quickly and coming to Cairo.

269
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:10,833
我理解
I understand.

270
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,250
等等 你就是这么道歉的？
Wait. Is that your apology?

271
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,083
-真好 真不错
-这样今晚才能顺利
- That's good. That's really good.- Just so we can get through tonight,

272
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,416
要不先别管咱们的破事了
maybe let's just give our shita rest for a moment

273
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,083
咱们先制定计划 找到…
and just try to strategizebefore we get to...

274
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,125
-莫加特？
-莫加特？
- Mogart's?- Mogart?

275
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,166
你知道 我不是来帮你的
Just so you know,I'm not here to help you.

276
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,708
我是为了我自己 还有那些
哈罗得手以后会送命的人
I'm here for me and for everyone elsewho would die if Harrow succeeds.

277
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,583
-明白
-很好
- Copy that.- Good.

278
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,541
我很抱歉
I am sorry.

279
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,833
不管你能不能接受
For whatever that's worth.

280
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,541
这个叫莫加特的 他真的有那个石棺吗？
So, this Mogart guy.He's really gonna have his sarcophagus?

281
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,041
是的 我打听过了
Yes. I asked around.

282
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,583
莫加特的藏品可是古董圈里常聊的八卦了
Mogart's collection is prime gossipfor those of us who deal in antiquities.

283
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,375
自从…咱们结婚以后
我就没听到过那个声音
I haven't heard that sound since...Since our wedding.

284
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:23,791
你本来可以告诉我的 知道吗？
你可以告诉我你的感受的
You could've told me. You know?What's it's been like for you.

285
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:26,666
关于史蒂文的事
About Steven.

286
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,750
不管怎么样 我一直控制得挺好 直到最近
For what it's worth, I had itunder control until very recently.

287
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,708
发生什么了？

288
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,041
没什么
Doesn't matter.

289
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,333
咱们本来可以一起解决的
We could've handled it together.

290
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,166
是的

291
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,625
这不是我的风格 对吗？
That's not really what I do, is it?

292
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:57,833
我就是个不善言辞的人
Never really been able to justtalk about everything.

293
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,250
不善于说真话？
Anything real?

294
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,291
是的

295
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:07,791
好吧 我知道

296
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:12,291
但是这并不意味着我们不该多沟通
But that doesn't meanthat we shouldn't have.

297
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,958
也许吧 但是现在可能有点晚了
Yeah. Maybe.A little too late for that now, though.

298
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:33,416
好吧 咱们把整个过程梳理一遍
Okay. Let's get our story straight.

299
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,416
这个家伙有很多朋友
This guy's got a lot of friends.

300
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,500
对 还有很多保镖
Yeah, and a lot with guns.

301
00:24:58,541 --> 00:24:59,416
那是什么？

302
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,291
哈罗的人在尾随我们？
Harrow's men keeping tabs?

303
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:05,750
我不知道 有可能
I don't know. It could be.

304
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,041
走吧
Let's go.

305
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,916
记住 你的名字是鲁菲诺·埃斯特拉达

306
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,875
好

307
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,791
我们刚从马尔代夫度蜜月回来
We just got back from our honeymoonin the Maldives.

308
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:22,500
还有什么能告诉他们的小细节吗？
That's an interesting little detailto give to them.

309
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:24,375
我会告诉他们你在礼品店工作
I'd tell them you worked at a gift shop,

310
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,250
但是他们不会相信我的 对吗？
but they'd never believe me, would they?

311
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,041
贝克

312
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:45,791
莱拉

313
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:46,916
好久不见
It's been a while.

314
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:49,000
-见到你真高兴
-是啊
- Good to see you.- Yeah.

315
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,708
-这边请
-谢谢
- Right this way.- Thank you.

316
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,583
他很期待和你见面
He's looking forward to seeing you.

317
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:57,750
我保证你们两个会很投缘的
After Madripoor I'm sure you twowill have a lot to talk about.

318
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,458
失陪一下
Excuse me for one moment.

319
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:02,416
莫加特先生很快就来
Mr. Mogart will be with you shortly.

320
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,666
怎么着 这家伙在后院弄个骑马打仗的游戏
So what? This joker just puts onEl-Mermah games

321
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,375
就是为了好玩？
in his backyard, for fun?

322
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:16,041
不是 这是他接受私人训练的地方
No, he gets private lessons by the bestin his backyard.

323
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:17,916
厉害

324
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:20,708
我喜欢那个袍子

325
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,750
莱拉 请进
Layla. Come in.

326
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,833
见到你真高兴
Such a delight to see you.

327
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:29,958
我也是

328
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:31,500
最近怎么样？
How have you been?

329
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:34,791
很好 谢谢你这么快就请我们过来
Good. Thank you for having us overon such short notice.

330
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,708
别这么说 你要是想来随时欢迎
Oh, please. I hope you realizeyou need no excuse to drop by.

331
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,416
这是我丈夫鲁菲诺
This is my husband, Rufino.

332
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,500
-很高兴见到你
-幸会
- Nice to meet you.- Pleasure.

333
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,666
好
Oh. Right.

334
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,583
希望你明白 这对于我而言不仅仅是收藏
I hope you understandthis is more than a collection to me.

335
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,833
保存历史对于我而言是非常严肃的责任
Preserving history is a responsibilityI take very seriously.

336
00:26:56,041 --> 00:27:00,458
一种自我陶醉的自命不凡的使命感 对吗？
A self-appointed responsibilitythat you alone were able to enjoy, no?

337
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:07,333
我保护文物还是出于慈善的目的吧
Well, I prefer to see itas a philanthropic effort at preservation.

338
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:13,250
我能问问 为什么对森夫这么感兴趣吗？
Now, if I may ask, why such interestin Senfu in particular?

339
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:14,833
其实 我们想买的是…
Oh, actually, our purchases are...

340
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:18,791
抱歉 你不介意的话
我想听听你丈夫的看法
I'm sorry. I'd like to hearfrom your husband, if you don't mind.

341
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:25,958
我觉得…我还是看看再说吧
I think that... But I thinkI just would love to take a look.

342
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,166
有趣的人

343
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,166
请自便

344
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,708
-太好了
-好 太好了

345
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:42,000
拜托 趁你还没搞砸 赶紧让史蒂文出来
Please, just let Steven outbefore you blow this.

346
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,625
不可能 好吧 你看见什么了？
Not a chance. All right, what do you see?

347
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:49,166
葬仪和守夜祷告的经文是一致的

348
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,083
你说什么？

349
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,625
是真货

350
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:54,791
我只看见了引导死者的文字
But all I'm seeing is literatureto guide the dead.

351
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,791
没提到具体的地点
There's no location indicated.

352
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:00,166
因为信息需要破解
Because the informationhas to be unlocked.

353
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,375
它被加密了

354
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,041
好吧…
Okay, um...

355
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:08,250
能稍等我一下吗？我要和史蒂文谈谈…
Will you give me a minute?I gotta talk to Steven...

356
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,083
你去拖住他
Just keep him occupied.

357
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,250
好吧 史蒂文 你想和我谈谈 说吧 怎么着？
All right, Steven, you wanna talk to me?Talk to me. What now?

358
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:21,750
你说怎么着？把我的身体还给我然后滚蛋
What now? What now is,you give me the body and you piss off.

359
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,916
该死 现在不是说这个的时候
Damn it, there's not time for this.

360
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,916
告诉我你知道什么
Tell me if there's somethingthat you know.

361
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:28,916
他就是需要自己在里面待一会儿

362
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,458
因为…他…

363
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,083
他在祷告

364
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:39,583
对不起 你把我关起来 休想让我帮你
Sorry. If you expect my help,it's not gonna be while I'm imprisoned.

365
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:40,875
你想让我大开杀戒吗？

366
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,458
-行 那就这么着
-好吧

367
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:46,708
你是个混蛋
You are the worst.

368
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,250
看看木乃伊的裹尸布

369
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,291
好 我要干什么？
Okay. What do I do?

370
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:54,125
把第一块拿起来 叠在中间那块上面
Take that first pieceand fold it over the middle piece.

371
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:55,708
-这个？
-对 就是那个
- This one?- Yes, that one.

372
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,416
-这样？
-对

373
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:05,750
等一下

374
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:07,791
如果你把那些星星
Now, if you match those stars up

375
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,125
和那边的另一块拼在一起
with the other piece over there,

376
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,291
-应该能拼成一颗星星…
-你在干什么？
- it should make a star...- What are you doing?

377
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,250
马克 不要
Marc! Don't.

378
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,875
该死

379
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,916
你们真的以为我是个白痴吗？
Do you really think I'm an idiot?

380
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,125
-给我跪下
-安东 住手
- Get on your knees.- Anton, stop!

381
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,250
给我跪下
Get on your knees.

382
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,000
好吧

383
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:44,458
莱拉 我都准备好和你讲和了
Layla, I was so readyto make peace with you.

384
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:47,833
你不知道 我们在试着拯救生命
You don't understand.We're trying to save many lives.

385
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:51,333
朋友 看看石棺里面
Hey, pal.Take a look inside the sarcophagus.

386
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,791
里面有个特别厉害的东西
There's somethin' really, really big.

387
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,041
这挺有意思的
Well, that's interesting.

388
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,958
看来感兴趣的不止你我
It appears we have a concernedthird party here.

389
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:09,541
起来

390
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:13,291
不管他们和你说什么
Whatever they've told you,

391
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:16,041
我保证能给你更好的条件
I'm sure I can offer you somethingmuch more tangible.

392
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,291
宝藏都到手了 还折腾什么线索？
Why settle for a cluewhen you can have the treasure?

393
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:27,458
安东 别听他的 他在阻止我们找到…

394
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:28,458
闭嘴吧

395
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,041
他会害死无数人的 相信我
He's gonna kill millions, trust me!

396
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,875
你还好意思说让我相信你？
Are you seriously talking about trust?

397
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:36,208
没有必要自损身份互相指责
Please, there's no need to descendinto violent accusations.

398
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:39,708
你们之间的共同点比你们想象的多
Each one of you has so much more in commonthan you know.

399
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,333
莱拉

400
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,541
你一直认为距离
you keep thinking that distance

401
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:49,125
能够治愈父亲被害给你带来的痛苦
will prevent the woundsfrom your father's murder from reopening.

402
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:51,125
但是你遇到了障碍
But something stands in your way.

403
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,625
你的丈夫没和你说实话
Your husband doesn't tell you the truth.

404
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:59,416
而马克 你没有告诉她
是因为你知道如果你说了
And Marc, you don't tell herbecause you know that if you do,

405
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,458
她就会像你看待自己一样看待你了
she'll see you exactlyas you see yourself,

406
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:04,416
一个不值得爱的人
as unworthy of love.

407
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,625
你这个混蛋
You piece of shit.

408
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:06,833
安东…

409
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,833
关于这些文物的传说
The lore surrounding these relics,

410
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:13,208
我可以证明都是真的
I offer proof that it's real.

411
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:21,000
这个石棺不属于任何人
This sarcophagus doesn't belong to anyone.

412
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,666
动手 召唤战服
Do it. Summon the suit.

413
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:28,500
让他们得到应有的惩罚吧

414
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,541
安东…

415
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:32,833
你想亲眼看看吗？
Would you like to see for yourself?

416
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,583
是的

417
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:36,000
我想看

418
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:50,708
你在等什么？
What are you waiting for?

419
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:04,416
感受一下我的神力吧
That's just a tasteof the godly power I offer.

420
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,291
他跑了
Hey, he's gone.

421
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:15,791
他在哪？

422
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,250
-帮我拖延点时间
-没问题
- Buy me some time.- I can do that.

423
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:27,500
马克 住手！
Marc, stop it! Stop it!

424
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:30,791
不 马克！
No, Marc!

425
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:44,916
把身体交给我 马克！

426
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,583
抱歉

427
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:54,458
你还好吗？
You all right?

428
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,125
行了 好吧 暂停
That's it. All right, time out.

429
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:00,583
暂停 各位 咱们都冷静一下好吗？
That's it, time out!Guys, let's all calm down, yeah?

430
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,708
咱们都太激动了
We're all worked up.

431
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:05,375
咱们冷静一下 好好谈谈…

432
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:09,291
身体交给你了 马克

433
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:54,625
莱拉
Layla!

434
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,208
-你没事吧？
-没事

435
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,875
-拿到了吗？
-拿到了
- Do you have it?- Yeah.

436
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:29,583
-咱们得找辆车
-好 快点
- We need a car.- Yeah, come on.

437
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:33,791
抓紧时间 马克·斯佩克特 抓紧时间
Tick-tock, Marc Spector.Tick-tock.

438
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,625
我真的挺喜欢那件夹克的
I really liked that jacket.

439
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,208
好吧

440
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,416
哈罗刚才在说什么？
What was Harrow talking about?

441
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,416
什么意思？
What do you mean?

442
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,000
他说我有权利知道
He said I had a right to know.

443
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,166
我不知道
I have no idea.

444
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:00,166
我从来没说过我搬家的真正原因
I never told anyone why I really moved.

445
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:03,625
但是他知道 他看穿了我的内心
I mean, but he knew,he just saw right through me.

446
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,416
他就是想扰乱你的心神
He's just trying to mess with you.

447
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,375
他在试图控制你的想法
You know, he's trying to get in your mind.

448
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,750
不要让他得逞
No, don't let him do that.

449
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,166
他认为他能够看到
You know, he's got this ideathat he can see

450
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:16,500
人类的真实本性 根本就是胡扯
the true nature of peopleor some baloney like that.

451
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:19,958
如果真是那样 就不会有一群杀人狂
If that were true, I don't think he'd havea bunch of homicidal maniacs

452
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,375
做他的信徒了 对吗？
as his disciples, would he?

453
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:24,083
所以他在说谎？他说你和…
So, it's not true?What he said about you and...

454
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:25,333
绝对不是真的
No, it's not true.

455
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,291
他就是想挑拨离间 别让他干扰你

456
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,583
每一次我对你有新的了解
Every time I learn something newabout you,

457
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:37,291
我都会想 “就是这样了
我们之间不会再有任何秘密了”
I think, "That's it. There can't possiblybe any secrets left between us."

458
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:43,208
然后就会有些事情冒出来
让我觉得根本不了解你
And then something else pops up,and it's like I've not known you at all.

459
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:45,958
对 你确实不了解
Yeah. You haven't.

460
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,000
根本不了解

461
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,500
我看见他们了
I've spotted them.

462
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:35,875
试试这个

463
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:38,583
也许吧
Maybe, actually.

464
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:40,833
-这个？
-好
- This one?- Okay.

465
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,625
不行 还有其它的吗？

466
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:50,333
我拼不出完整的星座
就是些支离破碎的布片
I'm not getting any whole constellations.It's just little pieces and fragments.

467
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:58,500
时间来不及了
This is gonna take forever.

468
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:04,833
马克 咱们需要史蒂文
- Marc, we need Steven.

469
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:10,291
他懂这些 我真的觉得应该让他试一下
He understands all of this. I really thinkit's worth giving him a shot.

470
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,958
我召唤众神 你召唤那个寄生虫
I summon the gods,you summon the worm.

471
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:18,083
他不会归还身体的

472
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:22,333
马克 没时间了 没事的 来吧
Marc, we can't wait.It's okay, just let go.

473
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:23,541
咱们没时间了

474
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:29,208
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

475
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,541
好吧 继续 你来吧
All right, go ahead. You're in.

476
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:47,208
多谢
Cheers, thanks a lot.

477
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,875
好吧
All right. Yeah.

478
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,041
开始了

479
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:03,791
这个不需要
Don't need that.

480
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:05,208
那个也不需要
I don't need that.

481
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:08,333
史蒂文？

482
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,250
埃及人发明了现代的导航
Egyptians invented modern navigation.

483
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,208
沙漠里并没有什么地标
There's not a lot of landmarksin the desert.

484
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:26,125
所以他们想了个办法
利用太阳和星星导航
So they came up with a wayto get about using the sun and the stars.

485
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:27,791
真是天才 对吗？
It's bloody genius, isn't it?

486
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:28,958
对

487
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:36,750
这是法语

488
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,833
我知道

489
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:45,958
咱们该怎么办？
So, what do we do with it?

490
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:52,708
我也不确定 但是如果…
Well, I'm not sure, but if...

491
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:54,416
等等 稍等一下
Wait, hang on a minute.

492
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:58,375
你看见了吗？看见那些细小的针孔了吗？
You see that?You see those little pinpricks there?

493
00:39:58,458 --> 00:39:59,791
那是个星座
That's a constellation.

494
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,916
咱们应该可以用三角测量法
把星星转换成坐标吧？
We should be able to triangulatethe stars into coordinates, right?

495
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,166
让我来扫描一下
Let me just scan it.

496
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,708
其实…抱歉 没那么简单
Well, um, actually...Unfortunately, it's not that simple.

497
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:12,375
-不行 为什么不行？
-是这样 森夫…
- Not working. Why isn't it working?- Yeah, yeah, you see, Senfu...

498
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:16,875
森夫大概在2000年前标记了墓穴
Senfu marked that tomb,like, 2,000 years ago.

499
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:20,583
星星的位置随时间流逝而变化
虽然变得不多
And stars drift over time.Not much as far as stars go,

500
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:23,583
但是差之毫厘 谬以千里
but it could mean the differencebetween us searching miles away

501
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,458
可能和我们要找的位置相去甚远
from where we're supposed to be looking.

502
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:29,708
除非我们准确地知道那一天天空的样子
So unless we know exactlywhat the sky looked like on that date,

503
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:32,166
否则我们就完蛋了
we're buggered.

504
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,916
我记得那天的夜晚
I remember that night.

505
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:38,458
我记得每一个夜晚
I remember every night.

506
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,041
孔苏？
Khonshu?

507
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:09,000
我可以还原那天的夜空
I can turn back the night sky.

508
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:12,208
-怎么做？
-要付出代价
- How?- It will come at a cost,

509
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:14,750
而且只靠我自己不行
and I cannot do it alone.

510
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,958
史蒂文 如果众神囚禁了我
Steven, when the gods imprison me,

511
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,875
告诉马克来救我
tell Marc to free me.

512
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,000
跟着我做
Do what I do.

513
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:48,458
什么？像这样？
Yeah? Like this?

514
00:41:56,416 --> 00:41:58,458
天啊 这太神奇了
Oh, man! This is mental.

515
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:35,208
这就是那天的夜晚
This is the night.

516
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:39,416
太痛苦了
This is surprisingly painful.

517
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,375
可以了

518
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,166
可以了 太好了
It's working. Yes.

519
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,583
好

520
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:51,958
这是你自找的 孔苏
You brought this upon yourself, Khonshu.

521
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:06,833
我的力量正在消逝
I can feel my energy leaving me.

522
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,375
天啊 我不知道还能坚持多久
Oh, God, I don't knowhow much longer I can do this.

523
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:30,875
坐标确定了 北纬29度 东经25度
Coordinates found,29 degrees north, 25 east.

524
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:34,666
我知道了 北纬29度 东经25度

525
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:58,000
史蒂文

526
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,666
史蒂文？马克？
Hey, Steven? Marc?

527
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,666
醒醒
Come on. Come on.

528
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,708
你怎么了？

529
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:12,000
马克？醒醒
Marc? Come on.

530
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:20,375
关于孔苏 你说得没错
You were right about Khonshu.

531
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:25,541
最终他让我们别无选择
And in the end, he left us no choice.

532
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:36,125
现在他被囚禁于此
Now, he's tethered to this place,

533
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,458
和他之前的众神一样
like many before him.

534
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,208
他能听到我们说话吗？

535
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:47,333
应该可以
We think so, yes.

536
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,541
我能告诉你一个秘密吗？
Can I tell you a secret?

537
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:18,541
我曾经很享受替你散播痛苦
I enjoyed dealing out pain on your behalf.

538
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:23,000
这是我背负的最崇高的罪孽
That is the greatest sin I carry.

539
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:28,291
我很感激你
I am grateful.

540
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:32,458
要不是你彻底毁掉了我
Had you not broken me so completely,

541
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:36,083
我可能永远都不会明白治愈的价值
I might never have knownthe value of healing.

542
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,125
我要去做你做不到的事了
I'm going to do what you could not.

543
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,625
事成之后
And when it's finished,

544
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,666
我想让你记住一件事

545
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,750
是你的折磨铸就了我
Your torment forged me.

546
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:01,375
我的胜利归功于你

547
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:19,083

Can you hear him?

554
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,041
Shit!

555
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,166
Not worried you might'veburned too many bridges?

556
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,458
Hmm. We'll never know.

557
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,708
Ha! The man indulged you.

558
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,833
- Easy to get stuck.

559
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:38,833
Just avoid your old haunts.

560
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,916
Call me sentimental,but I worry about you.

561
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,500
Thanks.

562
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:55,958
Oh, shit.

563
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,458
You killed him?

564
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,375
You're too late.

565
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,208
Oh, wow.

566
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,041
Oh. What, are we dancin'? We fightin'?What are we gonna do?

567
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,333
Ow!

568
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,291
Marc.

569
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,208
Stop it.

570
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,291
Stop.

571
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,791
Where are you taking me?

572
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:40,916
Airport.

573
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,291
- That wasn't me!

574
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,708
Let me talk to you for a second.

575
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,666
Marc.

576
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:07,958
What?

577
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,583
Oh, God.

578
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,791
Where's the tomb?

579
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:31,916
He's just a kid.

580
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,208
Where is Harrow?

581
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,000
- Praise Ammit.- No, kid.

582
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,125
Mmm.

583
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,583
we're gonna have to stop 'em another way.

584
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,041
Help!

585
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,166
Oh, I'll be there.

586
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,958
- I'm Yatzil, Avatar of Hathor.- Okay.

587
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Cool.

588
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,791
Surely Khonshu mentioned her?

589
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,125
- Sorry.

590
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:07,625
She says it was not so long agoKhonshu enjoyed Hathor's melodies.

591
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,791
I try not to fight it.

592
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,875
Great.

593
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:36,541
This is a man who literally does not knowhis own name.

594
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,291
He has a marriage certificateunder the name Marc Spector...

595
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,375
Liar!

596
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,208
Employment recordsunder the name Steven Grant.

597
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,333
Stop!

598
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,583
Threaten himself.

599
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,791
Oh.

600
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,583
Okay.

601
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,750
What happened?

602
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,333
Yeah.

603
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,416
Yes.

604
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:07,833
Yeah, I know.

605
00:24:58,541 --> 00:24:59,541
What is it?

606
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,750
Remember, your name is Rufino Estrada.

607
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:14,833
Right.

608
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,083
Bek.

609
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:45,791
Layla.

610
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,083
Cool.

611
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:20,708
I like the robe.

612
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,083
You, too.

613
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:21,125
- Hmm.- Mmm-hmm.

614
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,250
Funny man.

615
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,250
Feel free.

616
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,791
- Great.- Yeah. Great.

617
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:49,041
Well, the burial practices are in linewith the Studenwachen texts.

618
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,125
The what?

619
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:52,208
It's legit.

620
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,041
Uh-huh.

621
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,500
It's coded.

622
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:29,083
He just needs a couple minutesin there alone,

623
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,875
'cause... Yeah. He is...

624
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,125
He's praying.

625
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,500
Do you want a bloodbath? Huh?

626
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,541
- Fine, have it your way.- All right.

627
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,333
Check the cartonnage.

628
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,041
- Like this?- Yeah.

629
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,750
Wait a second.

630
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,958
Shit!

631
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,166
Okay.

632
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:09,708
Get up.

633
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:27,166
Anton. Anton, don't listen to this man.He's trying to stop us from reaching...

634
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,458
Please, stop.

635
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:41,166
Layla,

636
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:06,916
Anton...

637
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,375
Give them what they deserve.

638
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:29,541
Anton...

639
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,583
Yes.

640
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:36,500
I do.

641
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:15,875
Where is he?

642
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:44,916
- Give me the body, Marc!

643
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,000
Oh! Sorry.

644
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:05,208
Let's all just, like, chill the F outand talk for a second...

645
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:09,875
Take the body.Take the body, take the body, Marc.

646
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,500
- You okay?- Yeah.

647
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,750
Ay.

648
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,333
Oh, well.

649
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:29,250
No, he's just trying to divide us.Don't let him get in your head.

650
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,083
You don't.

651
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,041
Try that.

652
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:44,625
Uh... No. Anything else?

653
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:18,750
He won't return the body.

654
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:23,666
- We don't have time.

655
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,208
Here we go.

656
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:08,458
Steven?

657
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,041
Yeah.

658
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:31,666
Et voilà.

659
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,791
Whoa.

660
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:36,833
It's French.

661
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,833
I know.

662
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,125
- Whoa!

663
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,500
It's working.

664
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,750
Good.

665
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:35,250
- I got it. 29 degrees north, 25 east.

666
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:58,166
Steven.

667
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,750
Where are you?

668
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,291
Can he hear us?

669
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,666
I want you to remember one thing.

670
00:45:59,625 --> 00:45:58,750
I owe my victory to you.
