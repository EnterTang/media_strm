1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,950
Previously on "Unforgettable".

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,120
Queens homicide.
Hi, Carrie.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,190
You got a name, pal?

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,160
<i>Someone will die in 16 minutes. That's all you get.</i>

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,050
That's it. 16 minutes.

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,650
<i>- Why me? - The great sociopaths like to go</i>
<i>head-to-head with the best.</i>

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,630
His name is Walter Morgan.
<i>He's an attorney, but we can't touch him.</i>

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,610
<i>I called him.</i>
I met him. You're out of your mind.

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,680
I think we should loop Al in
on that little offer you got from your

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,140
- new pal Mr. Morgan. - I'd like to keep it quiet.

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,750
<i>This is exactly what</i>
<i>this guy wants, to get inside your head.</i>(******)

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,600
- He's doing what I want. - He's playing you.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,410
If this guy's <i>contacting you, Carrie, be careful.</i>

14
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,260
<i>I don't want to offer him up another victim.</i>(***)

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,930
What if he's trying to help me?

16
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,770
<i>Then you're making a deal with the devil.</i>

17
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,350
<i>Be seeing you, Carrie.</i>(*******)

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,770
There are pleasures in life it would be a crime to refuse.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,820
Wine is one...

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,020
another is friendship.
When it's offered.

21
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,650
Hard to find a friend;
an equal to discuss matters.

22
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,250
Is that why I'm here, Walter?
You're looking for a friend?

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,460
Sorry, didn't mean to show all my cards as once.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,360
Not much of a hand at poker, I'm afraid.

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,820
I prefer pool, all about playing the angles.

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,260
You a hustler, Walter?

27
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,170
No. Unlike you, I never gamble.

28
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,170
You're gambling now, having me here your house.
I have nothing to hide.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,070
A charming dinner companion for a little information.

30
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,270
Pretty safe bet, I'd say.

31
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,570
What do you know about my sister's murder?
Patience.

32
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,200
It's not a virtue of mine.
That's okay.

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,620
It's one of mine.
What's your game, really, Walter?

34
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,770
What do you want?

35
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,130
You said it yourself.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,020
I want you to need me...

37
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,650
...as a friend.

38
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,240
Shall we begin?

39
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,400
Roe.

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,050
Afraid work's starting this morning.
Yeah? What did we catch?

41
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,860
We got a fresh one out at an abandoned warehouse

42
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,350
on 516 Borden Ave.

43
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,610
516 Borden, 9:00. Come alone.

44
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,560
What kind, what kind of body?
It's a dead one, I think. Don't quote me.

45
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,430
I mean, male or female?
It's a male.

46
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,500
Middle-aged. Kind of hard to tell
with most of his head missing.

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,770
I'm on my way.
You got a minute?

48
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,990
Maybe pick up a bagel from that place on 23rd?

49
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,260
I haven't eaten breakfast yet. Hello?

50
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,340
It's the most important meal of the day.

51
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,370
We got a shotgun at close range.

52
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,280
Got one shell casing.

53
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,820
Security guard found him. Had the good enough sense
to get outside before he hurled.

54
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,080
$400 shoes.
What the hell was he doing here?

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,180
We're lucky security even noticed an open door
'cause nobody's used this place in months.

56
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,420
Yeah, we got Mike and Nina
circling the area.

57
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,680
See if there's any active security cameras around.

58
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,940
Let's see. Mr. Walter Morgan. 50.

59
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,200
Park Avenue.
Should have stayed home, Walter.

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,050
Let me see that.

61
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,750
You know this guy?
Where's Carrie?

62
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,950
Should be here any minute.
All right, I want you you do me a favor.

63
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,700
Call Webster, tell her the victim's name.
Ask her to handle the case personally.

64
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,270
Is there something I should know?

65
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,670
What's going on?

66
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,990
Walter Morgan's in there
with half his head blown off.

67
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,830
Well, hallelujah, I guess.

68
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,990
That's what I thought.

69
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,460
Who killed him?
Do we have to find out?

70
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,230
What do you think?
Shouldn't be too hard.

71
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,780
Guy like that had a lot of enemies.

72
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,120
He had a lot of friends.

73
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,620
Big Manhattan lawyer getting shotgunned in
the ass end of Queens,

74
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,110
This case will get a lot of attention.
What not even a bialy?

75
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,940
You got an appetite after all this?

76
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,410
Eating's a natural function. It's a part of life.

77
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,710
What do they say? In the midst of life I am in death?

78
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,860
So in the midst of death, how about a little cream cheese?

79
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,260
You don't know anything about my sister, do you!

80
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,960
You know, in Louisiana, somebody kicks,

81
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,880
they make a pot of gumbo so big,

82
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,440
they eat off it for a year.

83

86
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,070
How you doing?
I don't know.

87
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,400
I just can't believe it.
Did you tell Al?

88
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,380
That I kept investigating Walter Morgan

89
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,780
after he told me we were done?

90
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,220
After I told him I was done?

91
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,680
- I'll take that as a "no." - Yeah.

92
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,680
Do you mind if we just take a look at this together?

93
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,620
You're still not convinced,

94
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,440
Walter Morgan's whole life was about games,

95
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,710
impersonation, deception.

96
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,550
No, I'm not convinced.
Okay.

97
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,040
You mind?
No.

98
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,940
Sometimes the fingers swell after death,

99
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,120
so you just really have to tug.

100
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,390
Give me a second.

101
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,370
Okay.

102
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,870
It's been there a while.

103
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,450
Is that what you were looking for?

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,550
What are you doing here?
Where is Jensen?

105
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,990
He told me about your conversation.

106
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,250
You threatened him, Carrie?
That was unnecessary.

107
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,550
What are you talking about?

108
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,050
After our time together,
I so wanted to help you.

109
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,100
But now I realize
I might be keeping my promise at Jensen's expense.

110
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,870
Who is that? Is that him?
You need to calm down!

111
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,350
Is that him?! Jensen!

112
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,680
You made it all up, didn't you?
There is no Jensen!

113
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,390
You don't know anything about my sister, do you?!

114
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,900
Satisfied?

115
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,320
I mean, he's wearing
the same clothes as he had on last night.

116
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,810
And you would know that how?

117
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,360
I was at the warehouse last night.

118
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
Look, this guy,
he said his name was Jensen,

119
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,520
he called me, he said he had information
about Rachel's murder,

120
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,390
but he would only tell me in person.
So I went to the warehouse to meet him,

121
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,480
and Morgan was there.
He was alive when I left.

122
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,820
I was in and out in five minutes.

123
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,730
Which doesn't make your judgment going in there alone
- any sounder. - Right.

124
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,930
Do you have any idea who this Jensen is?

125
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,870
I have a phone number that a guy called me from.

126
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,550
I'm doing a reverse search to see if I can get an address.

127
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,480
Look, if you do locate Jensen, let me know

128
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,630
because there's some DNA under Morgan's fingernails

129
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,220
that might be the killer's.

130
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,990
I will definitely let you know what I find out.

131
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,730
Good luck.

132
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,180
And we also believe he was involved in the Benedict case.

133
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,650
But if we knew Walter Morgan was Carrie's caller,

134
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,370
why didn't we just grab him?

135
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,190
All we had to make our case were Carrie's memories.
Which we've relied on for a lot less.

136
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,860
a buddy of the Mayor, the D.A.

137
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,950
Wasn't gonna be good for any of us

138
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,110
to make allegations we couldn't support.

139
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,100
So there's nothing linking him

140
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,130
to Richard Simons, that guy in New London, the hardware store?

141
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,700
There wasn't a thing, forensic or otherwise.

142
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,140
Morgan is more a master of psychological manipulation.

143
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,970
He rarely does the killing himself.

144
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,820
He finds vulnerable people
prone to violence and encourages them to kill.

145
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,210
Anything you want to add here?

146
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,060
No, sounds about right.

147
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,920
Okay, so, still, if this guy's all you say,

148
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,500
then why wouldn't there be more people coming after him?

149
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,470
Okay, we got security video from the warehouse coming in.

150
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,470
Also put a rush on the ballistic test
for the shotgun shell.

151
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,520
Good. I'll get everyone the background
Carrie and I already worked up.

152
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,810
And right now Morgan's secretary is waiting for us
up at his apartment. Mike?

153
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,680
Carrie?

154
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,530
Sure.

155
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,380
I can't believe he's gone.

156
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,760
Walter was a kind and brilliant man.

157
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,080
He helped my daughter get into private school,
wrote the most beautiful letter.

158
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,770
We know this must be hard for you.

159
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,470
Looks like he had himself a little romantic dinner.

160
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,330
It's a bit odd of Walter not to have cleaned up.

161
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,460
He was unbearably tidy.

162
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,670
I don't think you know anything
about what happened to my sister.

163
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,160
Good night.
Don't go!

164
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,150
You'll get a phone call. His name is Jensen.

165
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,340
Could be good for us.

166
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,020
We should be able to pull some prints off this,

167
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,740
maybe help us I.D. the dinner date.

168
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,110
Was he seeing someone in particular?
I don't think so.

169
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,480
But he was having a problem with a woman.

170
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,100
I don't know her name, but he was concerned
she was stalking him.

171
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,280
He had me call a security firm
to ask about installing cameras.

172
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,860
Were they ever installed?
No, we hadn't gotten around to it.

173
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,990
I got gloves.
Sorry.

174
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,790
Don't know what I was thinking.
Thank you.

175
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,910
We'll get, uh, CSU up here.

176
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,130
Excuse me. Yeah.

177
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,380
Yeah?

178
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,880
All right, thanks.

179
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,170
That was ballistics.

180
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,380
They make the murder weapon a 12-gauge shotgun

181
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,320
loaded with reduced-recoil double-aught buck.

182
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,460
That's a... that's a police round.

183
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,260
I have a duck guy in Mamaroneck.

184
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,070
I don't understand the appeal of sitting
in a blind all day with a shotgun

185
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,260
waiting for a bird to fly by,

186
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,350
but you can't fault the results.

187
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,180
You know, I'm going to take off, head back to the office.
I want to talk to Webster.

188
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,780
You guys okay with everything here?
Did you get a good look around?

189
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,750
Yeah.
Remember everything.

190
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,460
All right. All right.

191
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,000
I was just about to call you.
You get the prints back?- ...

192
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,920
They were a match to Walter Morgan's background check

193
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,440
for the Kansas Bar in '86. It's definitely him.

194
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,970
This doesn't make any sense.

195
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,020
There's also something else.

196
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,980
I found some DNA under his fingernails.

197
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,010
Mine, right?

198
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,120
What's going on, Carrie?

199
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,840
He's framing me.

200
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,560
- For his own murder? - Yeah.

201
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,430
I know it sounds insane, and it's about to get worse.

202
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,760
This is the murder weapon.

203
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,990
- Where'd you find that? - In the trunk of my car... it's mine, too.

204
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,460
I need you to do a residue test on my hands

205
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,620
to prove that I did not fire that gun.

206
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,320
How did he get a hold
of your department-issued shotgun.

207
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,510
I don't know.

208
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,170
I mean, I was at his house for dinner
a couple of nights ago.

209
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,720
Maybe someone broke into my car when I went
to the warehouse to meet Jensen.

210
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

211
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,890
You were at his house?
He called me to tell me he had a lead

212
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,450
in Rachel's murder... Jensen... but he wouldn't tell me anything

213
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,710
over the phone, so I went there, and now I just...

214
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,090
I realize he was just trying to make sure
I was in the right place at the right time.

215
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,960
You have to tell Al

216
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,240
that we have been investigating Morgan,

217
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,470
that you were at his house,
everything.

218
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,260
I know.

219
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,010
I know, but I can't now.

220
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,670
I don't... I don't know what's real anymore.

221
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,050
I don't even know if this Jensen actually exists.

222
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,650
All I know is that someone else was there
at the warehouse that night.

223
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,400
Now, maybe it's the person who killed Morgan,

224
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,670
or maybe that person saw me leave
while Morgan was still alive, but I

225
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,550
got to find him, because it's my only chance,
and I promise you I'll come in as soon as I do.

226
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,880
I promise.
No one will believe you killed him.

227
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,340
But I have to tell your people about the DNA.

228
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,260
I know you do.
Just be careful.

229
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,750
I will.
Thank you.

230
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,160
They finally delivered that security footage

231
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,030
from the building next to the crime scene.

232
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,840
No.
Go on.

233
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,130
Hello.

234
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,430
Walter Morgan asked me to call... about a dead girl in the woods.

235
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,310
You're Jensen.

236
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,780
He told you my name?
I'm not sure this is a good idea.

237
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,660
No, wait, I-I really... I really want to talk to you.

238
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,650
You're a cop.

239
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,830
Yeah, but no matter what you say,
I promise you, none of this will come back at you, okay?

240
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,160
I'm only doing this because Morgan asked me to.
This isn't my thing.

241
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,280
Let's forget about it.

242
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,910
Listen, I-I know how much of a risk this is for you,

243
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,120
okay, so maybe I can make it worth your while.

244
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,270
- What do you mean? - I'll pay you.

245
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,510
Ten grand.
Okay.

246
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,390
516 Borden, 9:00.
Come alone.

247
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,900
You do anything to make me nervous, I'm gone.

248
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,030
Hello?

249
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,890
****

250
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,500
She thinks Morgan is trying
to frame her for his own death.

251
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,170
So he got himself murdered just to what, to punish her?

252
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,210
Or it wasn't him,

253
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,520
and whoever killed him knew that Carrie

254
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,100
was an easy target for a frame job.

255
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,630
You do a GSR test?
At her request.

256
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,110
It came back negative.

257
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,210
Of course, she's smart enough to know that you can get

258
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,970
the same results just by washing your hands.

259
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,450
Why'd she come to you, Jo?

260
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,600
Way I figure it, I got maybe two hours
before I have to call the captain

261
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,620
and tell him what's going on,

262
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,240
or we're getting bounced and sent to monitor evidence rooms

263
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,430
She's been investigating Morgan pretty aggressively.
What? When?

264
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,050
I'd say, ongoing.

265
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,810
Even after we came up empty and I pulled the plug?
Yeah.

266
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,490
What do you mean by "aggressively"?

267
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,630
- She meet with him? - Twice.

268
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,600
Once for dinner and last night.

269
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,790
Last night?
He was shot last night.

270
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,380
How could such a smart woman be so stupid?

271
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,940
- You knew about it? - Some.

272
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,410
He offered her information about her sister.
Of course he did.

273
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,480
Where is she headed?

274
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,550
Some guy named Jensen called
for a meeting at a warehouse.

275
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,500
He's either the killer or her alibi.

276
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,960
She's got to find him.

277
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,790
Look, if it makes you feel any better,
I think she knows how badly she messed this up.

278
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,990
It doesn't make me feel any better.

279
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,140
I'm disappointed, Jo.

280
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,520
You should have talked to me.

281
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,290
It was about Rachel.

282
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,420
Yeah.

283
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,330
How you doing?

284
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,320
Question:
Were you here last night? 4:00 to midnight.

285
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,830
Okay, I'm looking for one of your customers
who used the pay phone around 8:00.

286
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,670
I get 200 customers in here a night.

287
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,960
You want me to remember somebody who made a telephone call?

288
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,420
How many of your customers still use a pay phone?

289
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,800
All right.

290
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,180
Remember now?
Yeah. There were two guys.

291
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,960
One comes in here all the time... I don't know his name...
and, uh, yeah, I never seen the other one before.

292
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,210
Was one of them kind of skinny, slicked-back hair?
Yeah, slicked-back hair, nice suit?

293
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,360
Yeah. Yeah.

294
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,180
Tell you what.

295
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,700
You see either of those guys again,
you call that number,

296
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,930
 there's more money
- where that came from. - Hell, yeah.

297
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,990
Nina. You get anything?
Carrie's deleted her most recent e-mails.

298
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,950
If the answer to her address request is one of them,
it's going to take a bit longer to restore.

299
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,870
All right, stay on it.
Boss. I got a weird one here.

300
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,260
I mean, no weirder than anything else that's happened today,

301
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,870
but, uh, when we ran our dead guy's prints to I.D. him...

302
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,590
Yeah, they came back to Walter Morgan. I know.
Yeah, but we also got a second hit.

303
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,310
Seems the same prints

304
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,880
were found at the scene of a sexual assault
five years ago in Utah.

305
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,550
Salt Lake cops looked into it,
but Morgan was here running a trial at the same time.

306
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,080
They concluded it was a mistake.
Like I say, don't know what it means.

307
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,890
It means something. Stay on it.

308
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,300
Al, wait.

309
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,080
You got a second?
Yeah.

310
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,350
Listen, I got to say that I...

311
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,300
don't really know what to make of this.

312
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,340
She's had my back a dozen times.

313
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,410
But we're staring something
in the face here. Mike.

314
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,860
It's been nine years we worked together, Al.
I trust you.

315
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,140
I trust your instincts.

316
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,220
Trust them a little longer, okay?
All right.

317
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,640
I got it.

318
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,400
I have a duck guy up in Mamaroneck.

319
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,000
***

320
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,880
I don't think you know anything
about what happened to my sister.

321
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,900
- I wish you'd trust me. - Now, why would I do that?

322
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,100
Because we're alike.

323
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,980
We live in a bright world.
Clear, exposed, vivid.

324
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,830
They, on the other hand, sleep through a night

325
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,910
of half-truths, of shadows, unknowns.

326
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,130
We don't belong with them.
You don't belong.

327
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,680
What do I want?

328
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,070
I want you to realize that.

329
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,350
Good night.
Don't go.

330
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,650
You'll get a phone call.
His name is Jensen.

331
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:27,930
Thanks for dinner.

332
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,680
What the hell is going on?
I don't...

333
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,550
I think this guy was working with Morgan
to get me to the murder scene last night.

334
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,740
Is this your mysterious Jensen?
Yeah, I think so.

335
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,170
Well-well, how do you know that?
Short version is...

336
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,560
Walter Morgan told me that.
Was he alive or dead when he told you that?

337
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,320
I didn't kill Walter Morgan.

338
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,950
And this guy was my best chance to prove it.

339
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,420
Man. What are we gonna do?
I mean, we gotta do something about this, right?

340
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,270
Don't ask me, I just work here.
And not that it matters,

341
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,700
but we just got a match on Carrie's prints
in Morgan's apartment.

342
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,180
Well... I don't care. I don't believe it.

343
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,410
Okay, uh, Robert Jensen.

344
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:03,260
He's a P.I. out of Newark, uh, mostly marital stuff.
His secretary's freaked.

345
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,870
As far as she knows,
Jensen was just helping Morgan out with his stalker.

346
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,530
She did give us a list of past clients.

347
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,450
Time of death?
Webster's saying 20, 22 hours.

348
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,910
Pretty close to Morgan's.
Anything on the murder weapon? Yeah.

349
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,130
Same shotgun as Morgan, too.

350
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,940
- What is this guy, a magician? - It sounds like it.

351
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,820
What, so, what are you saying? You think she did it?
No. I...

352
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,690
I am saying that we gotta figure out how to handle this.

353
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,080
We got 11 ADAs, and four TV stations,
and three papers and gazillion bloggers,

354
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,700
all wondering what's up with the Walter Morgan investigation,
and right now I don't know the answer!

355
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,510
All right, look. Enough, okay?

356
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,360
She's in there talking to Al.

357
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,690
We'll figure it out.
Yeah, you're right. You're right.

358
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,820
Look, Al will know what to do, okay?
I don't know what to do.

359
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,450
You should've come to me.
With what? You made me promise to stay away from him.

360
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,090
If you'd told me about Rachel,
I would've understood a little bit.

361
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,970
No.
You would've insisted that I stay away even more.

362
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,930
For good reason, it turns out!

363
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,120
You actually had dinner with the guy?

364
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,960
- I know how bad this looks. - Do you?

365
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,360
'Cause I've never seen anything look quite this bad.

366
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,870
I know that if I was anyone else,
you would have arrested me by now, so thank you.

367
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:14,900
That's right.
But we're not anyone else, are we?

368
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,200
No.

369
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,420
Okay. What have we got?

370
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,900
I mean, claiming Morgan killed himself to frame you

371
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,250
for his own murder is not exactly a winning defense.

372
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,090
Al, I don't know how he's done it.

373
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,940
But this is his game,
this is how he plays.

374
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,180
What's the point of a game
if you're not around to know you've won?

375
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,400
Unless... he is.

376
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,400
Perhaps it's better that you don't remember
what happened on that day in those woods.

377
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,070
You haven't told me anything I don't already know, Walter.

378
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,430
You haven't told me anything that's not in the police report.

379
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,400
To live with that terror every day, every minute...

380
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,010
What else do you know, Walter?
Have you read Robert Frost?

381
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:01,070
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening."
"And miles to go before I sleep."

382
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,540
He was a little like you.

383
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:07,260
No time to dawdle, and "a little in love with death."
That's like you.

384
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,040
There was a poem.
I wasn't getting it at the time.

385
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,090
"And miles to go before I sleep."
He's not done.

386
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,510
Not by a long shot.
He wants to see if I can beat this.

387
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,660
Did he leave any clues as to how a dead guy isn't actually dead?

388
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,260
I can figure this out,
but I need to be on the case. I need to do my job.

389
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,760
All right, but it's all our jobs.

390
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,720
And there three detectives out there
who would lay down their lives for you,

391
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,690
and you left them in the dark.

392
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,530
Okay.

393
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,380
So... you seriously think Morgan could still be alive?
Yeah, I do.

394
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,630
Wait, o-okay, then... who the hell does Webster have in her freezer over there?

395
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,100
I- I'm here to help,
but the facts are the facts.

396
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,220
Look, I know this is
an impossible situation for you guys, I do.

397
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,270
All the evidence points towards me.
I lied to you guys.

398
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,280
But I'm telling you right now,

399
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,640
I didn't kill anyone.

400
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,730
Not Jensen, not Morgan. He's framing me.

401
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,460
I don't know how, but he is. Which is why I'm giving you a choice.

402
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,990
Sit this one out, or forever hold your peace.

403
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,480
I'm in.
Me, too.

404
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,190
Sure.
Thank you.

405
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,150
Okay. Nina, get the case file
and the crime scene photos to Carrie.

406
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,210
Mike, let's put out a Finest Message
on anyone matching Morgan's description.

407
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,960
And Roe, see if Webster's come up with anything on the body.
All right, where you going?

408
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,460
To tell the DA this investigation is ongoing,

409
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,230
and we have no solid suspects.

410
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:44,020
So... at... at Morgan's apartment,

411
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,050
you picked up that glass
on purpose, to get your prints on it,

412
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,890
to cover your tracks, right?
Like you said, the facts were adding up

413
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,010
and they weren't looking so good for me.

414
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,340
So...
That was clever.

415
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,450
You don't have to babysit me, you know.
No, I'm not.

416
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:19,660
I was just, you know, going through some old case files.
MmDid Al tell you to watch me?

417
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,600
Like a hawk.

418
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,790
You know, just so you know,

419
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,440
me and Roe had a plan to break you out.

420
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,230
Thanks, Nina.

421
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,620
I prefer pool.
All about playing the angles.

422
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,430
You son-of-a-bitch.

423
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,810
What? You got something?

424
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,910
Yeah. I got something.

425
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,260
All right, what do you got?
I don't know. Where do I start?

426
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,640
I'm gonna say "the beginning"
Right.

427
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,590
So you know that strange thing in Salt Lake,

428
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,710
where the cops thought they'd recovered
Walter Morgan's fingerprints five years ago

429
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,470
at the site of a sexual assault? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

430
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:37,620
But Morgan had an alibi, he was here in New York.
Right. So I snooped around a little.

431
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,120
It turns out the only other lead the police had in the case
was the name of a guy the victim met at a bar,

432
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,060
named John Fox.

433
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,430
But since they only had a name, and someone else's prints,

434
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,800
- it was a dead end. Right? - Wrong?

435
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,780
Well, I took the name "John Fox"
and just for the fun of it,

436
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,730
I ran it through a multi-linked recursion sorting program

437
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,190
with all the other information
we put together on Walter Morgan.

438
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,980
Known associated, past clients, school teachers, etcetera.

439
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,560
And it turns out...

440
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,410
Are you ready for this?
You had me at "recursion program."

441
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,360
Turns out Walter Morgan had a client named John Fox

442
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,440
25 years ago in Kansas. But not just any client.

443
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,630
Fox was the last client Morgan had

444
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,640
before he folded up his practice and moved to New York.

445
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,380
I'm excited, but I don't know why.
Here's why.

446
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:33,340
This is the Kansas DMV photo of a 16-year-old John Fox.

447
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,250
Threw a little face-aging software at it,

448
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,290
it's the same program the Feds use on photos of missing kids.

449
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,040
Same photo, aged 30 years,

450
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,290
in which John Fox looks an awful lot like...

451
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,020
- Walter Morgan. - Walter Morgan.

452
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,600
All right, the arms on the bodies at the warehouse
were placed in a very specific pattern.

453
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,560
We thought they might be pointing at different objects
in their surroundings,

454
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,250
but we couldn't find anything that made sense.

455
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,030
So I'm thinking...
...angles.

456
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,550
Angles.

457
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,640
So the body at the warehouse,
<i>Morgan.</i>

458
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,680
<i>One of his arms was placed at</i>

459
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,170
a 55-degree angle, the other at 50 degrees.

460
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,610
Jensen, in the van.

461
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,110
One arm at 13 degrees, the other arm at five.

462
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,270
Which gives us...
A phone number?

463
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,460
You try calling it?
Not yet. It's too soon.

464
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,330
I'm-I'm not ready... for him.

465
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,300
See, he wants to prove
that he and I are alike,

466
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,440
that we both live outside of society.

467
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,150
So what's he going to try and do?
Separate me from society.

468
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,210
And if you're wanted for murder,
he becomes the only one to turn to.

469
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,610
We have to convince him that he's succeeded.

470
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,900
That I've been abandoned by my own people.

471
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,140
You and Tanya, you were right.

472
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,720
John Fox traded places with Walter Morgan 25 years ago.

473
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,850
Now, Fox is done with his old life,
he's ready to start a new one,

474
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,910
and he wants me to be a part of it.
But he's got to know you'd never go along with it.

475
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:02,240
He's thinking if his plan succeeds,
you'll have no other choice.

476
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,320
I just got off the phone with the ADA.

477
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,560
They-they know that we are circling on somebody,

478
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,030
and they want to know who. I didn't know what to tell them.

479
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,330
Tell them you're arresting Carrie Wells.

480
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,030
<i>Local police hunt</i>
one of their own tonight,

481
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,420
as homicide detective Carrie Wells

482
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,340
is now officially the prime suspect

483
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,740
in the shotgun murder of
Manhattan attorney Walter Morgan.

484
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,340
The search for Wells began here,
on Skillman Avenue in Sunnyside, Queens...

485
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,370
Okay, I say go for it.
...when detectives arrived to take her into custody.

486
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,300
According to witnesses,
Detective Wells used a back alley to make her escape...

487
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,880
...discovered early this morning in an abandoned warehouse

488
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,780
in Long Island City.

489
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,830
Police are not releasing...
Hello, Carrie.

490
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,200
Great to hear from you.

491
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,540
You sure she's okay going in?
It's the only way.

492
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,140
Morgan's got to believe she's alone, or he'll be gone.

493
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,250
Anything yet, boss?

494
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,650
No. No contact, she hasn't seen him.

495
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,710
She's got him.
She sees him.

496
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,240
Okay, all right, we got that, Al.

497
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,060
Where is he?
Not sure.

498
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,180
Somewhere out in the middle there.
I lost her.

499
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,090
I'm moving in.

500
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,660
Walter?

501
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,660
I'm sorry, I have to go now.

502
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,040
It's a splendid view, isn't it?

503
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,000
I'll take your weapon.

504
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,160
It's just a precaution.
It's like my little prank just now;

505
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,220
it's more habit than anything else.

506
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,120
Dead man can't take chances, right?

507
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,050
Still nothing.

508
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,380
I got her. I got her.
She's talking to someone.

509
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,920
Is it Morgan?
Who's she talking to?

510
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,750
I can't confirm.
I'm going closer.

511
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,160
You did so well, Carrie. I'm proud of you.
You were right.

512
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,350
Minute they found Jensen's body, they came after me.

513
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,970
So...
So you see now, right?

514
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,680
It's impossible for you to stay with them.
I'll go anywhere with you.

515
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,800
I just, I want to get out of this city.

516
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,530
Do you really mean it?
Yes.

517
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,260
I planned it all.

518
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,470
It'll be a new life, you'll see. It-it will be a rich one.

519
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,510
at's odd.

520
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,580
There's no maintenance scheduled to the bridge today.

521
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,990
Carrie.

522
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,550
You really know how to hurt a guy.
Walk.

523
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,260
I lost them.

524
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,640
I don't have a visual.

525
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,810
So what now, Walter?

526
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,100
I always had a contingency plan.

527
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,910
It involves you and a stirring little suicide note,

528
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:26,540
And then what, you just disappear?
Shed this skin, take on another?

529
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,410
Is that it?
Yes.

530
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,640
How many lives can John Fox live?

531
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,820
Well, we've done our homework, haven't we?

532
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:39,370
What was so bad about being you that you had to take someone else's life?

533
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,350
You can't imagine.
And I hardly took it.

534
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,230
Walter and I had a mutual agreement.
A generous monthly stipend.

535
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,270
Heck, he never wanted to be a lawyer, anyway.

536
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:53,700
That was him at the warehouse that night, wasn't it?
The real Walter Morgan.

537
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,800
I invited him from Kansas City, yes.
It was a delightful reunion.

538
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,160
Walter took in a few shows.
He had a grand old time.

539
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,320
Till you took his face off with a shotgun.

540
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,230
Things change.

541
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,160
I was hoping you'd change.

542
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,500
I really was, Carrie.

543
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,610
Lock up traffic.

544
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,550
Lock it up now.

545
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,030
We would have been so matched.
So suited for each other.

546
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,160
No, see, I did my time in your world.

547
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,030
Too bad we didn't meet
back then; you might have had a chance.

548
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,220
I was a real mess.
Just like you.

549
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,660
Okay, enough. Get over there.

550
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,700
Go.

551
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,710
I want to know one thing.

552
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,530
Did you ever really know anything about Rachel's murder?

553
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:50,740
Anything at all?
You'll never know.

554
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,720
Sorry.

555
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,380
Good-bye, dear Carrie.

556
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,250
You tell me what happened to Rachel!
Tell me!

557
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,920
I can't hold you. You have to let go.

558
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,530
- No! - You have to let go of him!

559
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,190
He's right, you know.

560
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,930
Be seeing you, Carrie.

561
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,660
Thanks.
Harbor North's been dragging the river.

562
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,650
They haven't found Morgan, but they will.

563
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,780
I don't know, I just...

564
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,920
I guess I'll feel better when we have a body.
Yeah.

565
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,070
Speaking of dead bodies,
I think we got the story worked out finally.

566
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,390
You-you go ahead.
No, you go ahead.

567
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,960
I think you should. I think you should go.
We think it goes like this.

568
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,330
Way back in Kansas,

569
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,790
John Fox was a very brilliant
and very miserable young sociopath,

570
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,340
when he came upon an equally unhappy young lawyer

571
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,660
named Walter Morgan.

572
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,820
Morgan and Fox were about the same height, similar build,

573
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,210
which is why Fox must've decided
to use the resemblance to his advantage.

574
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:23,970
Whatever deal he offered Morgan, we have bank records that show

575
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,960
that he's been making payments to his Kansas account
for the past 25 years.

576
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,250
Couldn't have said it better.

577
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,950
So Morgan...
our Morgan... was paying off Fox

578
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,180
as part of a long-running identity swap?

579
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,460
All those years, he does whatever he wants
under an assumed identity.

580
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,270
And then when he's ready to disappear,

581
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:45,280
he just murders Fox, aka Morgan.

582
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,140
Which is why the body checked out as Walter Morgan

583
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,150
and why our victim was conveniently missing his face.

584
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,530
Only, he made one mistake.

585
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,780
He couldn't know Fox would commit a sex crime in Utah
and leave his prints behind.

586
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,380
None of this explains

587
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,690
how he knows anything about Rachel's murder.

588
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,930
I think you and I both know he probably didn't.

589
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,970
I'm sorry.

590
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,990
Excuse me, Detective Burns?
Thought you might like to see this, sir.

591
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:15,280
Yeah, what do weot?
Found it with Jensen's body in the van.

592
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,600
I was vouchering it and it started ringing.

593
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,700
Only one number in here.

594
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,250
Hello.

595
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,250
Hello. Who is this?
Who is this?

596
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,470
Carrie Wells, Queens Homicide.

597
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,200
This phone is evidence in a murder investigation

598
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,070
involving Walter Morgan.

599
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:51,150
You mean Detective Morgan.
I've been trying to reach him all morning.

600
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,990
I- I'm sorry. Who am I speaking to?

601
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,490
I'm Detective Franks, Syracuse P.D.

602
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,520
I've been working with Deputy Chief Marston.

603
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,180
Your Detective Morgan contacted us
about a case we have up here

604
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,900
involving an abduction and murder of a young girl.

605
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,700
Is-is this a cold case?

606
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,790
No, ma'am.
We found a body two days ago.

607
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,780
Can you tell Detective Morgan
his information was right on the money.

608
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,770
We got the guy.

609
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,330
You made an arrest?
We're talking to him.

610
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,130
Found him hanging around the crime scene.

611
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,600

00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,250
so I just sent you a picture.

Thanks.

00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,570
It's him.

00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,980
He killed my sister.
