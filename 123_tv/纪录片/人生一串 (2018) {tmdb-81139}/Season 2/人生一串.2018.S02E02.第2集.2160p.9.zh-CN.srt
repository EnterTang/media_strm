1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000


2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000


3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,010


4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,760
《欲奴》前情提要
Previously on "Submission..."

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,780
我只會住幾個月
I'll only be here for a few months.

6
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,970


7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,940
你又不能回到那段糟糕的戀情中了
It's not like you can go back to that shitty relationship.

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,770
我裝了一整年
I faked it for an entire year.

9
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,940


10
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,080
你正處在一種濫用權力的情況中
You're in a situation where there's an abuse of power.

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,900


12
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,420
她簡直目不轉睛
She couldn't take her eyes off of us.

13
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,700
我的上帝  就是她
Oh, my God. That's her.

14
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,590
-這是阿什莉  -我叫迪倫
- That's Ashley. - I'm Dillon.

15
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,860


16
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,530
-是想問問招聘的事  -定了  就你了
- I was wondering about the job. - Done. Yours.

17
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,700
你找到姑娘了嗎
Did you find a girl yet?

18
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,470
-還沒有  -太可惜了
- Not yet. - That's a shame.

19
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,990


20
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,000
"我叫瑪拉  我是他的奴隸
"My name is Mara and I was his slave.

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,690
"我知道我的性解放
"My road to sexual freedom

22
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,390
"只能通過我的服從實現"
could only be found through my submission."

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,260
轉過去
Turn around.

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,950
別看我
Don't look at me.

25
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,390
別看我
Don't look at me.

26
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,400
"要是他用來綁我的繩子突然斷掉
"Should these ropes he used to tie me down suddenly break,

27
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,730
我也不會動
"I would not have moved.

28
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,410
我是他的奴隸
"I was enslaved to him,

29
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,040
把我定在那里的  不是繩子
"And it was neither rope or cuff or belt

30
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,380
手銬或是皮帶"
that kept me there."

31
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,860
眼睛看哪呢
Where are your eyes?

32
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,960
"而是因為我堅定地需要
"It was my unwavering need

33
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,450
感受他的呼吸撫摸我赤裸的肌膚"
to feel his breath against my bare skin."

34
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,320
"我等待著定會來臨的疼痛
"I waited for the pain that I knew would come,

35
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,030
不是因為火焰
"Not from the flame,

36
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,990
而是因為每個男人似乎都會出現的
"But from the inevitable waning of emotion

37
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,280
不可避免的情緒衰退
"That seemed to take hold of every man.

38
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,020
我無力防備..."
I was defenseless and..."

39
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,850
早啊
Good morning.

40
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,840
天吶  你嚇到我了
Oh, my God. You scared me.

41
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,720
那是我的書
That's my book.

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,200
抱歉  我就是瀏覽看看
I'm sorry. I was just skimming through it.

43
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,210
你都流口水了
You were drooling.

44
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,170
沒有
No, I wasn't.

45
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,190
我并不喜歡這樣的書
I don't really like books like this.

46
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,670
好吧
Okay.

47
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,140
但如果你改主意了
But if you change your mind,

48
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,130
我周四會請幾個姑娘過來談論它
I'm having some girls over on Thursday night to talk about it.

49
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,390
讀書俱樂部什么的
Book club thing.

50
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,280
知道嗎  聽上去還真挺有意思
You know what? That actually sounds like fun.

51
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,550
好啊  你看我這本吧
Okay. You can have my copy.

52
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,350
反正你似乎把有幾頁都翻舊了
It looks like you wore out the pages a little bit anyway.

53
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,170

62
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,380
謝謝
Thank you.

63
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,380
"諾蘭·濟慈描述了一副性虐
"Nolan Keats paints a provocative picture

64
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,520
隱秘世界的撩人畫卷"
of the BDSM underworld."

65
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,360
還給我  還我還我
Give me that. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

66
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,720
沒想到你私底下是個禽獸
I never took you as a closet freak.

67
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,970
我才不是  而且你不是說
I'm not, and didn't you promise

68
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,910
今后會更專業一些嗎
to be more professional from now on?

69
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,230
我撒謊了
Oh, I lied.

70
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,370
-猜到了  -這到底是什么書
- Of course you did. - So what is this?

71
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,130
我覺得你看上去不像那種喜歡看小黃書的女孩啊
You don't strike me as a girl who likes to read smut.

72
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,580
是迪倫讀書俱樂部的書  不是小黃書
It's for Dillon's book club, and it's not smut.

73
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,790
好吧  "他的龍根一陣抖動"
Oh, okay. "His penis throbbed."

74
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,080
好吧  不要再羞辱我了
Okay, you can stop embarrassing me.

75
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,200
"我要來..."參加這個讀書俱樂部
"I want to cum..." to the book club.

76
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,200
{\an8}cum本意有射精的意思  此處同音

77
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,490
不行  只準女性參與
Well, you can't. It's for women only.

78
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,050
太可惜了  我還想弄清楚
Oh, too bad. I'd love to find out

79
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,990
為什么女孩子都突然喜歡看小黃書了
why sex books have suddenly become hip with chicks.

80
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,170
這是福音
It's gospel.

81
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,890
這是寫得很爛的小黃文
It's a poorly written smut story.

82
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,750
就因為這本書的作者更加了解女性嗎
Oh, just because the writer has a better understanding of women?

83
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,270
我很了解女性
I have plenty of understanding of women.

84
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,640
好吧  那給我說說迪倫是怎樣的人
Okay, then explain Dillon to me.

85
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,740
那丫頭瘋瘋癲癲的
The chick's crazy.

86
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,530
但你還是跟她睡了
Yet you slept with her.

87
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,940
只要瘋子夠性感  我們照上不誤
Guys don't have a problem banging crazy if crazy is hot enough.

88
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,580
不  她才不瘋呢
Oh, no, she's not crazy.

89
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,450
三個月前
Three months ago,

90
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,060
她在那邊的廁所跟一個陌生人啪啪啪
she fucked a complete stranger in that bathroom over there.

91
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,840
我覺得這就是瘋子
I'd say that's crazy.

92
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,070
什么
What?

93
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,530
她上的是某個家伙的女朋友
Yeah, some guy's girlfriend.

94
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,240
她們倆之前根本沒說過話
Never even spoken to her before.

95
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,800
我覺得我們應該選有工業化特點的
You know, I think that we might need to go industrial.

96
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,280
非常現代  大氣
You know, I mean, it's modern, it's gorgeous.

97
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,460
跟我們的公寓很搭
It would fit really well in our apartment.

98
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,270
-能夠讓我們...  -隨便你想怎么樣
- It would just make... - Whatever you want.

99
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,840
我都可以
I'm cool with anything.

100
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,720
也許我們能裝飾成
Yeah. I mean, maybe we could even go

101
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,130
拋光混凝土那樣
for some kind of polished concrete look.

102
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,520
弄點抽象藝術
You know, maybe get some abstract art.

103
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,930
我很喜歡那些柱子
You know, I love those columns,

104
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,620
還喜歡頭頂的那些光束
and I love the beams overhead.

105
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,890
然后我們可以搞幾個大沙發墊
Oh, and then we could get some really big sofa cushions,

106
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,350
既舒服  又實用
and then it would be more functional comfort,

107
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,700
而不是搞得很花哨
you know, instead of being actually showy.

108
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,820
不過  我挺喜歡花哨的
Although, I do like to be showy.

109
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,390
也許我們可以弄點大型綠色盆栽
Maybe we could get some big, green, leafy plants, you know?

110
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,350
但是然后我們要用金屬立燈還是交通式燈呢
Oh, but then do we do big metal lamps or do we do track lighting?

111
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,160
我感覺那樣現代風太重了
'Cause I feel that's too modern.

112
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,820
我們要更都市風一些  不是現代風
We need to be a bit more urban, not modern.

113
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,630
我去趟洗手間  很快就回來
I got to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.

114
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,500
好  去吧
Okay. All right.

115
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,730
都市風  就是這種風格  相信我沒錯的
Urban. That's the way to go. I'm telling you.

116
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,790
把門鎖上
Lock the door.

117
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,040
什么東西
What that?

118
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,280
來  脫掉
Here, take this off.

119
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,470
別出聲
Shut up.

120
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,530
好爽
Yes.

121
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,870
我的天
Oh, my God.

122
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,710
別誤解我意思
Don't get me wrong.

123
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,070
隨意打炮沒什么不對
There's nothing wrong with casual sex.

124
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,200
隨意打炮太他媽爽了  但迪倫比較怪異
Casual sex is fucking great, but Dillon's weird.

125
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,320
怎么  因為她跟你一樣放浪不羈隨心所欲嗎
Why, because she's as emotionally unavailable as you are?

126
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
差不多吧
Pretty much, yeah.

127
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,070
我也說不好  我覺得一個女人
I don't know. I think it's kind of cool

128
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,300
能那么隨性恣意還是挺酷的
that a woman can be that spontaneous.

129
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,780
也許你哪天應該來一發試試
Oh. Well, maybe you should try it sometime.

130
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,570
誰不想那樣被上啊
Who wouldn't want to get nailed like that?

131
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,180
我就不想  那是典型的虐待
I wouldn't. It was textbook abuse.

132
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,410
才不是呢
It was not.

133
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,800
瑪拉很明顯是斯德哥爾摩綜合癥的受害者
Mara was clearly a victim of Stockholm syndrome.

134
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,450
好吧  你這就走極端了
Oh, okay, that's extreme.

135
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,700
那完全是強迫性交
It was full on coercion.

136
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,400
他處在強權地位
He was in a position of power.

137
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,100
誰在乎是不是強權地位
Who cares if it was a position of power?

138
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,630
金姆  他用馬鞭抽奧利維亞
Kim, he used a riding crop on Olivia

139
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,500
好像她是種動物一樣
like she was some kind of animal.

140
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,690
好吧  是稍微有點變態
Okay, so it's kinky...

141
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,090
他還用狗鏈到處遛另外一個人
And he yanked that other one around with a leash.

142
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,010
給我舔
Suck it.

143
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,990
別激動  那只是角色扮演
Calm down. It was just role-play.

144
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,640
那不只是角色扮演
It was not just role-play.

145
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,580
他強行奴役他們
He forced them into actual slavery.

146
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,470
而她們還對他意淫得停不下來
And yet they couldn't stop fantasizing about him.

147
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,800
她們當然停不下來  因為書是一個男人寫的
Of course they couldn't, because it was written by a man.

148
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,280
據說而已
So they say.

149
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,670
別告訴我你相信
Please don't tell me you are buying into

150
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,520
"書是一個女人寫的"這種鬼話
that "It was written by a woman" bullshit.

151
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,480
可能就是女人寫的啊
Well, maybe it was.

152
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,580
如果是女人寫的
So if a woman wrote it,

153
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,580
那貶低女性就無關緊要了  對嗎
then we should be completely okay with misogyny, right?

154
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,690
不  這與貶低女性無關
No, that has nothing to do with it.

155
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,370
當然有關系
That has everything to do with it.

156
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,890
社會想讓我們認為
Society wants us to believe

157
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,250
女人是一種可悲的生物
that women are like these pathetic little creatures

158
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,840
生死全然取決于男人的心情
that live and die by a man's happiness.

159
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,220
女人想服從一個男人怎么就可悲了
Why is it pathetic if a woman wants to submit to a man?

160
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,510
你認真的嗎
Are you serious?

161
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,060
一點都不可悲
It isn't pathetic,

162
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,260
更多女人應該嘗試一下
and more women should give it a try.

163
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,370
我只是說在臥室里
I'm just saying that it's fun

164
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,530
放棄一點控制權會別有樂趣  僅此而已
to give up a little control in the bedroom, that's all.

165
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,140
姐們  說話不要說一半好嗎
Dude, you can't just say that and not elaborate.

166
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,040
不要了  我們是來討論這本書的
No. We're here to talk about the book.

167
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,080
書是關于性愛的
Which is about sex,

168
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,040
你不跟我們說的也是關于性愛的  所以
and so is whatever you're not telling us, so...

169
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,730
好吧  你們好煩人
Oh, you're all so annoying.

170
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,980
事件涉及到我丈夫安東尼
Okay, so it involves my husband Anthony

171
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,410
還有他最好的朋友
and his best friend.

172
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,680
已經大愛了
Love it already.

173
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,150
安東尼已經意淫這個好多年了
Yeah. So for years, Anthony had this fantasy.

174
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,740
過來
Get over here.

175
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,840
喜歡嗎
You like that?

176
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,330
姐們  太瘋狂了
Dude, that's fucking crazy.

177
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,430
我知道
I know.

178
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,510
你還樂在其中嗎
And you enjoyed it?

179
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,970
怎么可能不
How could she not?

180
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,850
那都不是她想象的  是她丈夫
It wasn't even her fantasy. It was her husband's.

181
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,170
誰管這個   反正很好玩
Who cares? It was fun.

182
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,100
你是在妄想
You are delusional.

183
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,890
反正沒人可以控制我做什么
Well, no man is going to control what I do

184
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,580
或者我上誰
or who I fuck.

185
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,440
有時候失去控制權有其自身的力量
Sometimes losing control has its own kind of power.

186
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,960
{\an8}還有多久退給我押金  文森特

187
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,490
{\an8}諾蘭·濟慈

188
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,740
來看看
Okay.

189
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,500
{\an8}讓人難以捉摸的諾蘭·濟慈

190
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,440
"諾蘭·濟慈的身份目前無人知曉
"The current identity of Nolan Keats is unknown.

191
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,540
"很多人懷疑作者其實是女性
Many have suspected that the writer is actually a woman

192
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,170
"以筆名來寫作
working under a pen name.

193
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,330
"濟慈的對外事務代理人最近宣布
Keats' literary agent recently announced

194
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,380
"《奴隸》不會有簽名售書活動
that there will be no book tour for "Slave",

195
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,450
"使大家對他/她的身份更加懷疑了"
further fueling suspicions about his or her identity."

196
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,420
我正在你床上滾來滾去
I'm rolling around in your bed right now

197
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,200
這樣我就能聞到你的氣息
so I can smell you.

198
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,110
我就是這么想你
That's how bad it's gotten.

199
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,880
話說你們談過了嗎
So have you had the conversation yet?

200
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,430
好吧  那什么時候
Okay, then when?

201
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,400
你知道我在你床上躺著而你卻
Do you know how hard it is to be here in your bed

202
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,450
在一個鳥不拉屎的地方讓我多煎熬嗎
when you're motocrossing all the way in Fuckit?

203
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,920
誰知道...無所謂了
Who gets... whatever.

204
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,980
我怎么可能知道
How am I supposed to know

205
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,590
怎么讀一個遠在天邊的地方的名字
how to pronounce a place halfway across the world?

206
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,240
糟了  我室友打來的  別掛
Oh, shit. That's my roommate. Hang on.

207
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,710
怎么了
What up?

208
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,250
迪倫把戴著手銬和眼罩的切爾茜推車里了
Dillon just put Chelsea in her car handcuffed and blindfolded.

209
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,540
然后呢
Okay.

210
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,470
然后呢
Okay?

211
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,790
你難道不覺得有點奇怪嗎
So you don't think that's a little bizarre?

212
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,680
大姐  那是迪倫  我說過她喜歡變態的東西
Dude, it's Dillon. I told you, she's into some freaky shit.

213
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,390
但是她到底在干什么
But what was she doing?

214
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,590
誰知道  誰管它
Who knows? Who cares?

215
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,940
我現在在處理真正的危機呢
I'm dealing with an actual crisis right now.

216
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,420
怎么了  發生什么事了
Why? What happened?

217
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,230
茱爾絲
Jules?

218
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,110
你還在嗎
Are you still there?

219
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,750
好吧你有事要掛了
Of course you have to go.

220
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,280
你總是有事
You always have to go.

221
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,490
我只能在這獨自一人聞你的床單
And I'm just here alone smelling your sheets

222
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,390
亂劍穿身
impaled by a bunch of swords.

223
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,550
只是打個比方
It's a metaphor.

224
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,230
等你回來你一定要去跟她說
So when you get back, you have to have the talk.

225
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,410
沒有你的我會枯萎的
I'm slowly dying here without you.

226
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,250
天啊  你能來我實在是太高興了
Oh, my God. I am so glad you're here.

227
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,300
我跟你說過她很瘋吧
Yeah, well, told you she was crazy.

228
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,880
給我個合理的理由  為什么會有人那樣
Give me one logical reason why somebody would do that?

229
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,010
迪倫這個人毫無理性  所以我給不了你理由
Dillon's not a logical person, so I can't.

230
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,600
不過那姑娘不會出什么事的  對吧
But, I mean, that girl's going to be okay, right?

231
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,340
當然不會
Yeah, of course.

232
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,810
你知道你是在胡思亂想嗎
Do you realize how crazy you sound?

233
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,250
沒有
No.

234
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,630
好吧  你需要再來一瓶啤酒
Okay, you need another beer.

235
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,420
好吧  你可以盡管取笑我
Okay, you can make fun of me all you want,

236
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:17,500
但是濟慈筆下的男人是女人真正想要的男人
but Keats writes men that women actually want.

237
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,570
好像霸道這種藝術形式不復存在了
It's like aggression is this lost art form.

238
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:28,280
男人都變成了非常被動消極的小男孩
Men have become these like passive little boys.

239
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,490
是嗎
Oh, have they?

240
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,150
-是的  -好吧
- Yes. - All right.

241
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,960
女人想要的男人是那種
Women just want a guy who can, you know, like,

242
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,560
直接推倒你開干的  知道嗎
throw down and get dirty, you know?

243
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,240
不不不  不不不
No, no, no. No, no, no.

244
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,390
-不行  -怎么了
- No. - What?

245
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,620
我們不能這樣
We are not doing this.

246
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,530
為什么
Why not?

247
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,240
因為我喝醉了
Because I'm drunk.

248
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,910
你也有點醉了
And you're kind of drunk.

249
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,170
-是  -不行
- Yeah. - No.

250
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,380
不行
No.

251
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,750
過來  別想跑
Wait. Where are you going?

252
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,860
好棒
Nice.

253
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,590
謝謝
Thanks.

254
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,670
我明天會后悔嗎
Am I going to regret this tomorrow?

255
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,940
沒人跟你說話  你就一句都不許說
Not a word until you're spoken to.

256
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,160
好了
There you go.

257
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,410
太緊了嗎
Is that too tight?

258
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,090
我喜歡緊一點
I like it tight.

259
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,520
向前坐
Sit forward.

260
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,890
好了
There you go.

261
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,700
迪倫
Dillon?

262
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,150
我說過我會找到一個
I told you I'd find one.

263
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,610
你覺得如何
What do you think?

264
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,790
她很漂亮
She's pretty.

265
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
切爾茜  這位是艾略特
Chelsea, I'd like you to meet Elliott.

266
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,430
你好
Hi.

267
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,940
我們開始吧
Let's begin.
