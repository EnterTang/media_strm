1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,610
Homemade food

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,080
following the principle of frugality

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,200
can transform the most mundane into the spectacular

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,120
From the ground, Wu Yegen shoulders back leaf mustard

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,040
When the leaf is fresh

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,160
it is bitter and astringent

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,200
To be a true delicacy

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,860
it needs time 

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,570
to dry in the sun

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,480
fading the bright turquoise

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,160
Salinity stimulates the exudation of cellular juice

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,800
and kills harmful bacteria at the same time

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,840
so that the leaf mustard can ferment

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,600
in a secure environment

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,840
More than ten days later

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,160
leaf mustard turns over a new leaf

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,000
accepting the gentle baptism of the early spring sunshine

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,520
Dehydrate again

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,360
Aromatic substances concentrate and accumulate

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,760
In the early April of Shaoxing

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,880
the air smells of special fresh flavor

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,560
Then

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
leaf mustard has a new name

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,100
dry mustard

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,040
With dry mustard

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,440
My wife made several dishes

27
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,000
which were my daughter¡¯s favorite homemade delicacies

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,520
Besides pork with mustard

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,240
people in Shaoxing also make soups with dry muatard

30
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,480
In the hot water

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,720
dry mustard uncurls

32
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,200
the rich flavor

33
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,100
releases slowly

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,540
Cooking with bamboo shoots and shrimp

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,200
the liquor color is red and clear

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,740
These ingredients provide their own taste in the soup

37
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,880
Who cooks so well?

38
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,800
Thank her

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
Leaf mustard continues fermenting in the jar

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,800
the longer it ferments

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,300
the more mellow it is 

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,540
In the Andes

43
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,720
a ridge of 4000 meters above sea level

44
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,640
a mystic ceremony of ancient Inca Empire

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,340
is performing

46
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,350
Sacrificing food and wine to the Earth Goddess

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,680
is an important cult before family party

48
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,400
Cooking food on land

49
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,920
is called ¡°pachamanca¡± by the local people

50
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,310
which means the earth pot

51
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,840
Potato, corn and sweet potato in the ground kettle

52
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,280
native to South America

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,960
are Incas¡¯ staple food

54
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,320
Sweet potatoes 

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,840
are highly adaptable to edatope

56
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,760
Therefore, they are spread all over the world

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,680
and even influence the population distribution

58
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,520
Thank all the gods

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,320
Thank Mother Earth

60
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,320
for giving us rich Pachamanca

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,200
Around the 16th century

62
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,640
sweet potato across the ocean

63
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,400
came to China

64
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,000
Fujian Province is one of the earliest landing places

65
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
This rhizomatous plant

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,600
had solved several historical famines

67
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,720
and was planted across the country quickly

68
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,520
The sun is shining gloriously

69
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,440
Lin Chunyin does not dare to slack off

70
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,920
He want to catch every autumn sunshine

71
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,360
Today Chinese people eat sweet potato

72
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,520
not just for filling the stomach

73
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,960
I used to play this all the day when I was a kid

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,360
I never played it

75
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,160
Chunyin, just hit it twice

76
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,840
Well

77
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,680
Now we have so much sweet potatoes and liquid

78
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,460
Pick up the breed with a higher content of starch

79
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,160
Shredding

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,280
Soaking

81
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,780
Separating starch

82
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,480
Subsiding for a night

83
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,600
The starch caked

84
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,880
In Lin Chunyin¡¯s memory

85
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,480
When sweet potatoes are harvested

86
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,000
mother always makes such food with complex procedures

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,440
Even though he has already got married and settled down in Beijing

88
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,480
this food still appeals to him

89
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,520
This year Lin Chunyin decided to return home with friends

90
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,000
to learn this craft

91
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,200
Shall we cover it with cloth?

92
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,800
It will be thick after stirring

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
When sweet potato starch is heated

94
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,640
it will be charming translucent

95
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,920
It is flexible chewy, and mild sweet

96
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,460
that is a popular dessert

97
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,880
Steam thoroughly

98
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,140
and pour again

99
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,200
It needs 3 hours 

100
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
when 15 layers are well done

101
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,840
After molding

102
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,640
starch cake weighs 18 kg

103
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,040
Drying in the shade and dehydrating gradually

104
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,750
the hardness of starch cake is appropriate

105
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,880
To be an easy cooked ingredient

106
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,520
it still needs some efforts

107
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,880
With the sunshine and wind

108
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
potato vermicelli dryed thoroughly

109
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,760
and got the final color and texture

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,160
Pure potato vermicelli 

111
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,000
is tolerant

112
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,000
which can absorb all kinds of tastes easily

113
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,520
Cereus sinensis 

114
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,420
also called garlic

115
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,360
can be used in stewing

116
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,680
With its thick juice

117
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,000
the intensity of its umami is triple that of crab

118
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,640
Potato vermicelli with super adsorption

119
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,040
can be cooked for a long time

120
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,400
so that each vermicelli can fully absorb the richness of Cereus sinensis 

121
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,040
With fully pouring of lard oil

122
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,600
the level of rich taste has increased greatly

123
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,350
The Lins are also preparing dinner

124
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,800
With fresh vermicelli

125
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,680
seasonal seafood

126
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
a simple bowl of vermicelli soup is made

127
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,720
Sweet and delicious

128
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,750
Taste great

129
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,200
Taste of home

130
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,680
does not refer to a particular food

131
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,560
The whole family sit together around a table

132
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,720
which is a more true and complete taste of home

133
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,920
Someone wanders outside

134
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,640
and comes back to home

135
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,560
Someone is far away from family

136
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,040
and goes throughout the world

137
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,360
In the early morning, Li Geng leaves the work shed

138
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,600
He has not seen his family for more than 300 days

139
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,720
His workmate Zhang Jie also must rush to the construction site on time

140
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,720
Their construction site is located in the South American continent

141
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,540
16000 km from China

142
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,360
Within less than 40 years

143
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,560
more and more Chinese people work overseas

144
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,270
Nowadays, the number is over 10 million 

145
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,760
In the Santa Elena water construction site

146
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,460
Li Geng communicates with the local people without any obstacles

147
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,900
The assistant zhang jie has also no problem

148
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,160
Humans have firm taste memory

149
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,400
especially for the vast majority of Chinese people

150
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,440
The local rice is a little hard

151
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,840
which is unacceptable

152
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,000
and they only have vegetables like tomatoes and onions

153
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,680
They seldom eat green vegetables

154
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,200
If we only eat green vegetables

155
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,400
they will say that Chinese people only eat grass
