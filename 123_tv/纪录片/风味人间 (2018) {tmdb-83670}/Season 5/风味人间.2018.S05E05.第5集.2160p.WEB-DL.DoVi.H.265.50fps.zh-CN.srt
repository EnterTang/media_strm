1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,810
Last week,my best friend came back to life.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,640
The day before,he died.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,180
A few days before that,he emerges as the most powerful member

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,930
of this tribe called the Angelics.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,440
He acquires magical powers they didn't even think was possible.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,050
People used to think he was mad. They were wrong. He's special.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,620
But him being special's been a tumultuous time.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,840
And that's not even half of it! There's these dead people...

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,310
the Fades ... and they're trying to come back to life,

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,760
led by this dude called John,

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,770
who died in 1943 and has come back to life by eating human flesh.

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,310
And now he's got a taste for it,he just can't stop.

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,700
Yeah,I know.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,010
He tricked Paul into helping him rescue this girl,Natalie,from the Angelics.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,610
And with her help,he's bringing a whole army of dead people back into our town.

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,310
We've got to fight. Meanwhile,the Angelics have their own plan.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,870
How? By having one of our team on theirs.

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,880
Those of us in the middle of it ... me,my history teacher,

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,390
Paul's mum,Paul's sister,Paul's girlfriend ... just stick out our chin,

20
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,210
grin and try and pretend we understand what's going on. Scary.

21
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,550
Now,who's seen my Matrix box set?

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,140
I'm pretty sure I've worked out who the Architect is a metaphor for.

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,760
Na-Nu,Na-Nu.

27
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,670
I've been waiting for over an hour!

28
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,690
'For those with missing persons enquiries,

29
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,880
'a crisis centre has been set up at St Barnabus School.

30
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,350
'I repeat,a missing persons crisis centre has been set up at the school.'

31
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,060
I don't even know if he's all right or if he should be here!

32
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,710
The doctor didn't even want to discharge you.

33
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,550
I am allowed to be worried. He's fine. Watch this.

34
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,850
Lord Of The Rings.

35
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,500
Why don't they just fly in and out of Mordor on the back of a giant eagle?

36
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,300
Boom! They didn't want to discharge him because he's too well.

37
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,850
That's ridiculous. Mission Impossible 2.

38
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,920
Cruise finds a face mask of the bodyguard without having seen or met him?

39
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,120
Likely Kaboosh.

40
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,840
Very few people actually come out of a coma healthier. It's... odd.

41
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,140
My name is Dr Mac the Movie Doctor and I pronounce a clear bill of health.

42
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,600
He's got a good recall of basic facts. "Basic facts"?

43
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,900
The Matrix.

44
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,570
'This is Steve... '

45
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,620
Where do I start? Direct hit.

46
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,000
Steve! Call me back! Boom! Ssh! Boom!

47
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,540
Home run.

48
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,810
"Got well soon."

49
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,680
See what you've done there.

50
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,260
I'm OK,Mum. Good to have you home.

51
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,230
Steve's still not answering my calls.

52
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,560
MISSING PERSONS MOUNT IN ...?

53
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,740
Yeah,the school's going to be a secondary location,

54
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,150
we're completely swamped on missing persons.

55
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,880
Armstrong wouldn't know a suspect if one bit him on the arse.

56
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,830
Look,Carol,I need to go,right?

57
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,610
Hello.

58
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,030
Hello.

59
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,060
We come in peace.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,010
Do you now?

61
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,060
That must be nice.

62
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,500
Sarah?!

63
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,030
So why are you here? Paul's back.

64
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,740
What?

65
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,540
Back from the dead? Sarah?

66
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,370
Are you OK? So has he eaten,then?

67
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,920
No,He hasn't eaten. He just... came back.

68
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,810
He closed an ascension point but.. The point's closed?

69
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,290
That's what happened,isn't it,eh? Sarah...

70
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,780
Sarah's eaten,hasn't she?

71
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,230
Hasn't she? It was my idea.

72
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,930
At least we're trying for a solution to this mess.

73
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,610
Sarah eats,she'll be reborn.

74
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,640
Immortal,just like him. The boy,he came back.

75
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,750
The boy's the answer!

76
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,510
The answer to what? People have died.

77
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,900
The boy's a joke.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,210
We can beat them,we need to try.

79
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,800
With Sarah's help we can start to fight back.

80
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,540
You're going to destroy her,Neil. I'm not staying to watch.

81
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,060
What's happening?

82
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,460
I don't know.

83
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,790
Must be him.

84
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,420
We've got to get everyone out of here.

85
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,530
BOILERHOUSE

86
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,150
We've got two more. Good.

87
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,160
I love this.

88
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,400
I love you.

89
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,660
I've never been happier than I am right now.

90
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,120
Thank you...

91
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,260
for what you did.

92
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,310
Tried and failed to save you?

93
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,940
Tried and failed to save me.

94
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,230
Pleasure. I came back from the dead.

95
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,010
What I am,who I am has got to mean something.

96
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,650
It probably does.

97
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,350
I was ready to ascend.

98
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,610
I'd let everyone down,

99
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,040
and I was ready to leave this...

100
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,640
rock for ever.

101
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,970
Yeah,yeah,yeah,so you came back to life.

102
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,690
But can you do this?

103
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,080
Can you though? No. Can you?

104
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,500
Well,then you're nothing to me.

105
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,900
Shut up!

106
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,790
Paul.

107
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,910
Don't tell anyone but there's a real live girl in your room.

108
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,030
Are you wearing identical pyjamas?

109
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,530
Yeah,they were... they were the only two I had clean.

110
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,610
Likely story.

111
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,810
So your mum was pretty clear I should sleep in Anna's room.

112
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,850
Yeah. But I don't want to.

113
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,350
No?

114
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,490
I get it.

115
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,500
Don't mind me. I'll just be quiet in the corner.

116
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,320
You do anything you want to. I won't listen or watch.

117
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,760
Sofa downstairs it is. Yeah.

118
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,500
Night. Night.

119
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,150
You're not even scarred.

120
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,990
The doctor thinks me a medical miracle.

121
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,440
The doctor thinks you're a freak.

122
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,460
You're my freak,though.

123
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,370
Yeah.

124
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,330
You... Are you the man in charge? How did you get in here?

125
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,170
You need to get everyone out of town. It's not safe.

126
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,510
- Full scale evacuation? Great! - You're just what I need

127
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,940
You need to leave. Now. You're going to die here. All of you!

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,080
If you don't get out,you'll be arrested,understand?

129
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,830
Men with power. You think you can scare me,you little,little man?

130
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,570
I'm actually average height.

131
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,580
Any news on Clement?

132
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,010
Nothing.

133
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,270
When do we add him to that?

134
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,780
What now?

135
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,190
There's only one thing to do,we've got to try and find Paul,eh?

136
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,400
Alice?

137
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,400
Rargh!

138
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,540
What's she?

139
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,880
The girlfriend?

140
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,280
Yeah. Pretty.

141
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,350
Neil,what are you doing here?

142
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,110
'You were dead.'

143
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,340
I know. And now you're back.

144
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,240
Alice thinks that makes you important.

145
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,090
What do you think?

146
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,650
I think I should have a knife at your throat right now.

147
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,710
Why did you do it?

148
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,970
Why did you help him? He promised he wouldn't hurt you.

149
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,610
And you believed him?

150
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,280
A murderer? You were cutting Natalie up.

151
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,480
You were torturing her.

152
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,630
He told me that's what the Angelics had always done.

153
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,530
Suppressed,policed.

154
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,770
That's what I believed. What we did,we did for the good of everyone.

155
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,500
We thought they could be dangerous. It turns out,we were right.

156
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,740
The past is a hole and it's full of what-ifs.

157
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,310
And I live in the present.

158
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,850
You? Don't know where you live.

159
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,710
You confuse me.

160
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,290
'One thing I do know... ' is that you are going to matter.

161
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,260
And when we find out why that is...

162
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,400
you'll have to pick a side.

163
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,570
Just make sure you pick the right side,kid.

164
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,360
Hello,Sarah.

165
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,070
Welcome.

166
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,990
I can't... You want to.

167
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,300
One time,during the war...

168
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,900
I was fighting alongside this NCO called Richard...

169
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,960
something.

170
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,450
They brought a man with his guts ripped out

171
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,010
into the hole that we were in.

172
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,830
Then someone shouted for medical support...

173
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,390
and Richard raised his hand in the air

174
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,020
"I'm a medic."

175
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,920
And then I watched him...

176
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,010
as he went and held this man's guts together

177
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,460
and then watched him till he died.

178
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,880
And afterwards I said to him,

179
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,970
"Richard,I didn't know that you were a medic."

180
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,390
And he turned to me and he said...

181
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,560
"I'm not.

182
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,440
"I just wanted to know what the insides of a man felt like."

183
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,530
Urges are OK.

184
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,410
They're human.

185
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,950
Just eat.

186
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,950
And you'll be reborn.

187
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,220
Don't fight it,Sarah. We win.

188
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,430
Sarah?

189
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,420
Sarah!

190
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,600
Shit. Mum?

191
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,590
MUM!

192
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,000
Bad dream?

193
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,350
Yeah.

194
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,140
I didn't wet the bed,though,so that's a bonus.

195
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,370
We're going to school. Are we? They've set up a crisis centre.

196
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,860
Steve's not answering my calls.

197
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,420
I think he's missing and Mum says she'll drive me but only if you come.

198
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,150
Paul,I'm not asking. I'm telling!

199
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,120
I don't know whether there's enough people...

200
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,770
Hi. Excuse me? My name's Mark Etches.

201
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,930
I was told to report to you.

202
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,500
Not unless you're in need of help and guidance you weren't.

203
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,760
Peter. Peter Tremlett. Doctor.

204
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,150
I'll be running a counselling service.

205
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,620
Right. Well,thanks for coming in,Mark.

206
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,490
We're going to need everyone we can get.

207
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,530
Now,let's see if we can find someone to show Mark around,all right?

208
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,730
OK.

209
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,760
You really don't have to show me everywhere,you know. I want to.

210
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,970
And just round here,we're starting up an online database of missing persons.

211
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,060
Steve? What you doing here? Didn't you know?

212
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,370
I'm dead civic-minded,sir. I work with the elderly,too.

213
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,910
Wiping their arses and everything.

214
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,940
We've actually had a remarkably good response to our request for volunteers.

215
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,320
I've got a clipboard and all.

216
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,390
Hi,hello. We're looking for missing persons.

217
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,270
Who are you missing? Steve. Steve McEwan. Steve?

218
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,340
He's not missing. He's a volunteer.

219
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,780
Steve's a volunteer? He's helping with the online databasing.

220
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,680
Anna,wait. Anna!

221
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,930
I think I could be of more use here.

222
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,580
Yes,join me.

223
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,050
Hello,stranger.

224
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,130
Hello,stranger still.

225
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,980
Surprised to see you here.

226
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,270
My housemate's mum has gone missing.

227
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,250
I'm... moral support.

228
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,300
Is your wife still missing?

229
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,190
Pretty much officially dead.

230
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,790
Pink suits you.

231
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,480
What's so funny?

232
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,570
What? What's so funny?

233
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,560
Sorry,who are you? Vicky,this is... Dr Tremlett,right?

234
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,000
No,no,no,sorry. I'm just kind of interested...

235
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,740
in what's so funny right now,yeah?

236
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,060
It was just a private joke.

237
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,350
Yeah,and we're actually quite busy,so unless you want something?

238
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,540
Yeah.

239
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,200
Yeah,I want something.

240
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,750
COUNSELLING SERVICE

241
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,750
"Volunteering"?

242
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,030
He's seen some opportunity to seek out some new pussy,more like.

243
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,580
If I had you,I'd never let you go.

244
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,440
In order for you to have me,I'd have to be

245
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,610
gagged,blindfolded and locked in a chest. That could be arranged.

246
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,670
Why's this door locked?

247
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,790
Speak of the fucking devil. Where have you been?

248
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,920
Being a devil,I guess. Are you dribbling?!

249
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,300
Course I am. I've missed you,sweetness.

250
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,910
Tch! Does that work? Does that work in your head?

251
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,880
"Haven't seen my girlfriend in days,I'll flob on myself and she'll forgive me."

252
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,400
Anna. Stop. That's not normal dribble. He's one of them. One of what?

253
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,040
Yeah,one of what? Don't come any closer. Or what?

254
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,920
He's my boyfriend. Yeah,and now he's dead.

255
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,950
He used to be dead,now he's come back to life!

256
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,500
What?! Babe,that's not true.

257
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,610
Anna,trust me. He wants to kill you.

258
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,110
Go.

259
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,570
Steve,what the fuck are you doing?

260
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,120
Steve?

261
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,560
Have to keep feeding...

262
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,600
Sarah. Sarah! They're coming for them so quickly.

263
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Sarah. It's me. Sarah,Where were you?

264
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,620
We need to keep killing. They can only eat flesh.

265
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,530
What did you see? Did you find him?

266
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,760
I've done... It's OK,you'll be fine.

267
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,430
Some things. Tell me where you've been.

268
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,630
Sarah,you're going to be fine. Listen to me. It hurt. So bad...

269
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,720
Too badly. I know it did.

270
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,900
There were bodies. So much blood.

271
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,360
Why is every door... locked?!

272
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,520
Steve's dead? My boyfriend's dead?!

273
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,440
Surely more important is the fact that he's a zombie?

274
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,800
He was dead. Now he's not. That makes him a zombie.

275
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,400
It's more complicated than that.

276
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,840
In fact,you were dead and now you're not. Makes you a sort of zombie.

277
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,900
Mac,this is real. This is dangerous. This...

278
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,270
There you go.

279
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,580
So,er... so your children are at this school?

280
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,390
Yeah,Paul and Anna Roberts. Anna,well,you've met her.

281
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,860
She's loud. Paul...

282
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,440
Well...

283
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,090
Well,he's... Paul's quieter.

284
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,390
More contemplative.

285
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,840
If you ever want to talk to anyone,Dr Tremlett

286
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,730
runs a counselling service in the gym.

287
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,740
OK,thank you.

288
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,310
What are you doing with us? We... are...

289
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,700
keeping you. Keeping us for what?

290
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,440
Keeping us for what?!

291
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,500
Come on!

292
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,870
How'd you know where the key was?

293
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,650
I volunteer here sometimes.

294
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,380
You're a library monitor?

295
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,570
My boyfriend's dead,and you're a library monitor?

296
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,170
Paul,what the fuck has happened to Steve?

297
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,360
What is he?

298
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,750
If I make an educated guess,he died,OK?

299
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,350
He became a ghost.

300
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,010
A Fade. Then this guy called John,he's

301
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,950
from the 1940s,he used to be a Fade ghost,

302
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,590
he's probably taught him how to eat flesh and grow a new body.

303
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,080
This is serious,Paul. I am being serious.

304
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,400
We are in so much danger. Trap him or something.

305
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,100
You ain't afraid of no ghost. No,no,you're mental. You're both mental.

306
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,020
Steve's mental,you're mental...

307
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,960
and Jay's a fucking library monitor!

308
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:18,070
I'm sorry,Anna. My brother?

309
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,650
My stupid pissing brother?

310
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,000
Little pig,little pig,let me in!

311
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,870
Anna,let me in! Let me in right now.

312
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,140
That's it. That's it.

313
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,920
Dad,Dad? It's gone to answerphone.

314
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,700
The one time having a dad who's a policeman might be useful. School. Now!

315
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,430
There's...

316
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,610
Fuck.

317
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,820
I'm going to rip your fucking head off and spit down your neck.

318
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,330
I'm not afraid of you,Steve.

319
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,860
No-one could be that scary with a dick your size!

320
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,590
We're going to die here.

321
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,260
I knew this would happen. Death before life.

322
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,690
I'm going to die and I haven't even felt a breast in my hand.

323
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:06,070
Haven't even seen a breast. That's your excuse to flash me,by the way.

324
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,180
Flash this!

325
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,480
We need weapons.

326
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,320
Weapons are no use.

327
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,070
Can't kill them. They're immortal.

328
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,250
I don't even know how many there are.

329
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,030
What about Mum? She's still in the hall.

330
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,850
We need to get out of here,get back to her.

331
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,230
Shit,fuck,shit. Paul,what are we going to do?

332
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,700
Right. Who's first?

333
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,620
Me!

334
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,590
That's for scaring my... Argh!

335
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,770
See? Now he's de...

336
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,720
This is your mess. I shouldn't be cleaning up your mess!

337
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,010
He'll be back. Let's go.

338
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,290
Where's Jay?

339
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,250
Jay. Jay?

340
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,400
Jay? Jay?

341
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,290
Jay? Jay?

342
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,200
Jay!

343
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,030
You have 30 seconds to tell me everything I need to know about Paul.

344
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,030
Start with what he can do. He came back for a reason.

345
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,690
To stop you. Wrong answer.

346
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,490
Me?

347
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,760
No,take one of the others. I can be useful.

348
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,370
I can be useful,I can show you where things are.

349
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,680
I don't want to die yet!

350
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,720
! Fuck!

351
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,480
OK. I'll try again.

352
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:51,780
Paul.

353
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,850
The boy that was,that now is.

354
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,100
How has he dragged himself back to life? Did he eat?

355
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:00,820
No.

356
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,950
He's important.

357
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,350
Eeny. Meeny.

358
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,190
Miny.

359
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,420
Mo.

360
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,320
You.

361
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,810
Are.

362
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,160
It.

363
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,140
No,no,no... It's OK,it's OK.

364
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,410
Phil! PHIL!

365
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,410
PHIL!

366
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,890
I went to them. Yeah?

367
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,480
I didn't mean to,but I went to them.

368
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,830
I was drawn there.

369
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,000
Where? Where,Sarah?

370
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,600
I fucked up,Neil. I fucked up.

371
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,760
Jay...

372
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,570
You're pretty.

373
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,250
You've got hair like a boy,but you're pretty.

374
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,540
Do you think I'm pretty?

375
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,720
Don't cry.

376
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,040
This life is going to be better for all of us.

377
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,340
I was never happy as a human.

378
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,400
But when the change happens to you,and it will...

379
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,130
the world just... opens up.

380
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,140
Natalie.

381
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,290
Don't worry,he'll come for you.

382
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,700
Jay. Have,er... Have you seen Jay?

383
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,460
Jay? I'm sorry. She was the last one they took.

384
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,530
They took Phil.

385
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,900
Where? Where did they take her?

386
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,390
Paul!

387
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,260
Hello,Paul.

388
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,150
Dr Tremlett.

389
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,180
How's the nightmares?

390
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,210
Still wetting the bed? He's one of them.

391
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,820
Dr Tremlett.

392
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,190
I need to leave.

393
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,310
Are you going to get out my way? Paul...

394
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,970
Don't pick a fight with it.

395
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,560
You should listen to your friend,Paul.

396
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,910
He's afraid. I'm surprised you're not.

397
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,670
You used to always be afraid of everything.

398
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,470
I'm still afraid.

399
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:03,500
I'm afraid of letting my friends down,

400
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,670
I'm afraid of not being good enough,

401
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,040
I'm afraid of not doing the right thing.

402
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,980
But you?

403
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,800
I'm bored of being afraid of things like you.

404
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,150
Do you remember I told you once that you reminded me of me?

405
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,360
You remember I told you once to get out of my way?

406
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,430
They've got my girlfriend. I need to get back to her.

407
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,720
You always were...

408
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,420
such a whinging little shit.

409
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,190
And all that talking,whining...

410
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,830
"I can't control my bladder." Well,fuck you and fu...

411
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,300
We may not be able to kill you but we can keep you from doing damage.

412
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,740
This was a mistake! I'm losing me.

413
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,300
I've got this hunger. This hunger. No. You're strong.

414
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,600
You're strong. You're stronger than you know.

415
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,380
Listen to me.

416
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,680
You need to go to the school.

417
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,030
I'm not leaving you. No way am I leaving you.

418
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,320
You did this for us. For me.

419
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,340
Neil,that's not true.

420
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:40,630
I did it partly for you,

421
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,480
and partly because...

422
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,950
I was frightened of what was going to happen to me,

423
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,750
but mostly...

424
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,170
mostly...

425
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:57,760
I did it because Mark didn't want me around any more and I couldn't...

426
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,910
You always did see the best in me.

427
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,960
Mark.

428
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,280
Please,please leave me. Leave me.

429
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,850
You need to go to the school.

430
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,700
You need to stop him.

431
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,490
For me.

432
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,480
For everyone.

433
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,560
The boiler room.

434
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,440
The boiler room.

435
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,170
OK.

436
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,020
I'll always see the best in you.

437
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,470
You're all right.

438
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,390
It's all right.

439
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,640
Paul! Paul!

440
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,040
This is a school.

441
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,460
Not a fucking... fridge.

442
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,550
It is... what it needs to be.

443
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,130
PAUL! Neil,NEIL! Paul,go!

444
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,350
What did I do?! What did I do to him,Neil?!

445
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,180
You killed him,Paul! You can kill them.

446
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,390
Where is he? Where's the killer?

447
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,660
He's getting away!

448
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,920
I need you,Paul! I can only slow them down.

449
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:09,560
Paul!

450
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,160
PAUL!

451
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,210
I'm a freak.

452
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,950
But I'm your freak,remember?

453
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,790
Paul! Come on!

454
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,070
Shit.

455
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,360
Paul?

456
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,680
No,no,no. Stay back. Stay back!

457
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,220
Paul,you need to kill him. I can't see him. I can't see him!

458
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,110
It could be any of them. Kill them all! My mum's in this room!

459
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,490
He's there. Do it! Do it,Paul!

460
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:11,210
My name is Detective Chief Inspector Armstrong.

461
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,280
But I'm not here as a policeman.

462
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,800
I'm here as a citizen,

463
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,440
as a man,as a father...

464
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,900
to tell you I think you should leave town.

465
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,860
We don't know what's happening,we don't know how it's happening,

466
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,810
and we have no idea how to stop it. Not the murders,

467
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,860
the attacks,or the tremors.

468
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,220
We need to evacuate now.

469
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:48,470
Now!

470
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,500
This can't be why I came back.

471
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,060
No.

472
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,380
I killed Steve.

473
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:17,410
And that... girl.

474
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,030
Natalie.

475
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,990
They burnt up.

476
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,660
But they were dead already,right? I don't want to be a killer.

477
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,070
You don't have to be one.

478
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,220
Superman could crush Lois Lane after an argument about the washing-up.

479
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:42,170
He could melt the Daily Planet after a bad day at the office.

480
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,180
He doesn't.

481
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,620
He uses his powers for good.

482
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,460
That's all you need to do.

483
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,020
Got to go.

484
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,580
It's you and me,then.

485
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:22,550
We start a clean up,Paul,now. And identify them? How?

486
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,550
I can't tell them apart from ordinary people,can you?

487
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,510
We don't even know how many of them there are. Well,we'll find a way.

488
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,380
A way that doesn't involve me killing everyone?

489
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,900
Look after him,won't you? Paul?

490
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,400
I think he can look after himself.

491
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:46,720
Look after your mum.

492
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,080
That I will try to do.

493
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,810
Look after yourself.

494
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,290
You want me to look after me? Yeah.

495
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,580
Give me your hands.

496
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,060
You've got three seconds. OK.

497
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:13,570
Three.

498
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,610
Two. One.

499
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,230
OK? OK.

500
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,590
Look after yourself,too.

501
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,110
Yeah.

502
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:31,500
You ready?

503
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,620
Probably not.

504
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,870
Come on.

505
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,590
A 17-year-old boy,Neil.

506
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,540
And if these powers have been given to me for a reason,then...

507
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,090
maybe it's not to kill everyone.

508
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:01,100
Maybe it's because I can see past your shit and his shit.

509
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:03,150
Is that the shit that just saved your life?

510
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:05,190
If all the world needed was more death...

511
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:09,780
then you'd have been given these powers. If I had one-tenth of your powers,

512
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,310
I'd be giving you such a fucking kicking.

513
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,360
I'm going to find a better plan.

514
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:17,140
Another way.

515
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,210
Ascension is broken,I'm going to put it right.

516
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,130
Better? You think you can do better?

517
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,850
You're signing a death warrant for everyone here.

518
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,970
There's going to be reborns everywhere.

519
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,520
DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME!

520
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,230
Hello.

521
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:22,980
Can I come in?

522
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,830
You've got no time. No time.

523
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:52,690
Dad,I have things here worth thousands of pounds on eBay.

524
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,270
I refuse to rush.

525
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:09,460
Yeah. Why rush?

526
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,220
Tortoise always wins.

527
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,060
I'm here to take you with me,Mac.

528
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:22,540
Where?

529
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,980
Somewhere I can persuade Paul to follow.

530
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,720
You're taking me hostage?

531
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:29,470
Yeah.

532
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,160
That's about the most efficient way of putting it.

533
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,130
Why?

534
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,080
Because he's stronger than me in every way...

535
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,720
except one.

536
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,330
He has people he cares about.

537
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,010
I'm his weakness?

538
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:47,740
Yep.

539
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,520
And I intend to take full advantage of that fact.

540
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,960
Come on,Mac. Hurry up.

541
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,960
Don't make me hurt your dad,Mac,because I am this close.

542
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,060
Get a move on.

543
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,530
Mac!

544
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:34,290
Mac!

545
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:38,000
Paul,kitchen. Anna,get some clothes.

546
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:38,800
Jay,call your mum.

547
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:40,920
You've got five minutes.

548
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:44,150
Paul.

549
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,350
What I saw you do... Best to forget about that,Mum.

550
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,500
Sometimes,I'd sit outside your room listening to you have nightmares.

551
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:57,790
I'm scared.

552
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,200
That's understandable.

553
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,600
I don't know whether to be scared for you or scared of you.

554
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,480
I'm going to make you proud of me,Mum.

555
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:14,490
I hope so.

556
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:24,070
I'm a teeny tiny bit claustrophobic,

557
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,600
so if you could leave the light on... Shut up.

558
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:10,840
Can you knock?!

559
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:15,920
Where's that stripy hoodie of yours?

560
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:19,420
Have you packed all the food? We need to move quickly.

561
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,080
I'll kill you.

562
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,810
Now!

563
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:59,530
You make one move towards my family.

564
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,000
Jesus. That almost sounded grown-up,then.

565
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,590
That was very manly,very good.

566
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,690
I meant...

567
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,160
I mean it. You know,it's interesting,isn't it?

568
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:17,050
When I kill,people can come back.

569
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,270
But then when you kill,people are wiped from existence.

570
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:24,190
Yeah? Why's that interesting?

571
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,590
Because I'm the one people think is the monster.

572
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,520
And today,you killed the one person I had left that I loved.

573
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,250
And I wanted you to feel similar pain.

574
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:38,980
Me and you,we're the same.

575
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,200
I'm the chosen one of my people.

576
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:48,930
You're the chosen one of yours. Nah,we're not alike.

577
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,230
I will find a way...

578
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:57,870
to hurt you.

579
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,260
To kill you.

580
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,960
I didn't come back to be a monster.

581
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:07,400
D'you hear me?

582
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,310
I'll find a way to help you.

583
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,790
Free you. No,good luck with that.

584
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,180
You have been NOTHING but helpful so far.

585
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:31,400
