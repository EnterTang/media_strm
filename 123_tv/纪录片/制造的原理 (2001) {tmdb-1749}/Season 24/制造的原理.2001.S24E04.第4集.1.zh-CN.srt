好的 可以
Ok, we'll find you.

131
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,717
- 谢谢 大夫  - 不客气
- Thank you, Doctor.  - Sure.

132
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:28,787
我刚和Anne的前夫通过话 他半小时后过来
I just spoke with Anne's ex-husband. I'm meeting him in half an hour.

133
00:08:30,997 --> 00:08:34,717
除非你改变主意...
Unless you're changing your mind...

134
00:08:38,337 --> 00:08:40,817
我之前从未受过勒索
I've never given in to blackmail in my life.

135
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,597
是的 但想到今晚你会面临的一切...
Yes, but considering everything that you're up against today...

136
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:44,637
我们决定...
we decided that...

137
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:49,517
我决定付钱! 是我的选择
I decided to pay! It's my choice.

138
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:52,647
David 你选择是正确的
And David, you're making the right one.

139
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:55,907
给这小子钱 让他爬回窝里去
Give this guy some money, he crawls back under his rock

140
00:08:56,147 --> 00:08:57,907
这样对大家都好
and life will be a lot simpler for everyone.

141
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:01,487
包括Anne
Including Anne.

142
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:06,657
但愿如此
I hope so.

143
00:09:11,127 --> 00:09:11,877
喂
Yes.

144
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:13,877
Jack Bauer来电 阁下
I have Jack Bauer on the line, sir.

145
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:15,127
接过来
Put him through.

146
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:17,927
接通了总统 Bauer先生
The president's on the line, Mr Bauer.

147
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:19,717
总统阁下? 我是Jack Bauer
Mr President? It's Jack Bauer.

148
00:09:19,797 --> 00:09:21,217
你好 Jack
Hello, Jack.

149
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:26,007
听说Hector Salazar给出了 释放他兄弟的细节要求
I was told that Hector Salazar has given your office final instructions on delivering his brother.

150
00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:27,097
是的 阁下
Yes, sir.

151
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:31,267
还听说 你们能在此之前 先发制敌
I've also been told that you might be able to pre-empt that demand.

152
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:35,527
我们找到了病毒携带者 一个叫Kyle Singer的小伙子
We've identified the person carrying the virus. He is a young man named Kyle Singer.

153
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:40,197
- 找到他了吗?  - 没有 阁下 跟丢了
- Then you know where he is?  - No, sir. Unfortunately we lost him.

154
00:09:40,357 --> 00:09:41,817
找得到他吗?
Can you find him?

155
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:45,997
在Hector Salazar给出的时间期限里 办不到
Not in the time-frame that Hector Salazar has given us to release his brother.

156
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:52,327
所以我只能交出Ramon Salazar 或承受病毒散播的危险
So, either I hand over Ramon Salazar or risk that his brother will release the virus.

157
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:55,457
总统阁下 我知道你不会这样选择
Mr President, I understand that this is an impossible choice.

158
00:09:55,587 --> 00:10:00,007
这不是选择 Jack
It's not a choice, Jack. Not really.

159
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:04,927
不与恐怖分子协商 是对他们最有力的威慑 这是我国的政策
This nation's policy of non negotiation with terrorists has been a proven deterrent.

160
00:10:05,097 --> 00:10:08,597
向Salazar妥协 会极大损害国家的政策
Capitulating to Salazar would effectively destroy that policy.

161
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:12,267
总统阁下 无数无辜的人可能会在一周内死去
Mr President, hundreds of thousands of innocent people may die within the week.

162
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:15,147
如果释放Salazar 今后会有更多人死去
More would die in the long run if I released Salazar.

163
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:18,567
我会将美国人民置于更危险的境地
I would be declaring open season on the American people.

164
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:23,197
- 这是你最后的答案?  - 我决不向恐怖分子妥协 Jack
- This is your final answer, sir?  - I don't negotiate with terrorists, Jack.

165
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:29,537
- 我不向恐怖分子妥协!  - 明白了 阁下
- I won't negotiate with terrorists!  - I understand Mr President, thank you.

166
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:35,787
召开疾防中心和卫生部会议
Conference in CDC and Health Services.

167
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:39,667
商讨全面检疫隔离和疏散计划
I want a full briefing on quarantine and evacuation procedures.

168
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:42,467
是 总统阁下
Yes, Mr President.

169
00:10:57,553 --> 00:10:59,223
我们要去哪儿?
Can you just tell me where we're going?

170
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:03,063
不知道 就是离开这里 想出解决办法
I don't know, ok? I've just gotta get out of town for a second, and figure this whole thing out.

171
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:05,443
你不是要去见那些人吗 所以我才带钱过来
I thought you had to meet with those guys. That's why I brought you the money!

172
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:07,613
情况有变 好吗?
Things have changed, all right?

173
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:11,073
你在干嘛 Kyle? 你叫我偷爸爸的钱给你
What are you into, Kyle? I mean, you ask me to steal this money from my father

174
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:14,113
那些人就不会因你丢了毒品而伤害你...
so those guys won't hurt you over losing their drugs...

175
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:16,123
那可能不是毒品!
I don't think it was drugs!

176
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,283
什么? 那是什么?
What do you mean? What is it about?

177
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:21,373
不知道 今天警察去了我家
I don't know. These cops, they came to my apartment today,

178
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:23,043
他们说什么...
and they were saying something about...

179
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:26,383
利用我... 把病毒带到这个国家!
using me to... to bring some weird disease into the country!

180
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:28,133
病毒?
A disease?

181
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:31,713
嗯 警察说... 病毒在我身体里
Yeah. This cop, he was... he was saying it was inside of me.

182
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:35,255
你身体里?
In your body?

183
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,419
我知道...
I know...

184
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,071
听起来很可笑 是吗?
It sounds ridiculous, right?

185
00:11:40,474 --> 00:11:42,224
是吗?
Right?

186
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,415
老天 事情太离奇了 对吗?
Man, this whole thing is so surreal, ain't it?

187
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:49,485
停车
Pull over.

188
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,840
什么?
What?

189
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,653
叫你停车!
I said pull over!

190
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:55,321
你干嘛? 你干嘛?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

191
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:58,161
车和钱都给你! 随便你 但别把我卷进去!
Take the car, take the money! Whatever you're doing, I don't want any part of it!

192
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:00,291
喂 linda! Linda 别这样! 别这样!
Hey look, linda! Linda, come on! Come on!

193
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:03,831
别靠近我 好吗? 如果你有病毒 我不想被传染!
Stay away from me, ok? If you've got some kind of disease, I don't want it!

194
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:06,631
- 谁叫你这么干的!  - 你以为我知道实情?
- You should have never done any of it!  - DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?

195
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:07,961
Kyle 别这样!
Kyle, please!

196
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:13,464
好 宝贝 你是对的 我不靠近你 好吗?
Fine, fine. Baby, you're right. You're right, I'll stay away, ok?

197
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:15,887
钱在前排座位下
The money's under the front seat.

198
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:18,387
别这样 Linda 求你了!
Ok, now, come on Linda, please!

199
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:22,162
Kyle 我真的不想你出事 但我帮不了你
Kyle, I really don't want anything to happen to you, ok? I really don't but I can't do this!

200
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:24,905
我真蠢!
How stupid am I!

201
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:28,027
对不起
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:29,937 --> 00:12:33,237
快跑! 快跑! Linda! 快跑!
Go! Run! Run, Linda! Go!

203
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,684
阁下 我们做了隔离区的监控计划书
Sir, we have a monitoring plan for everyone inside the quarantine zone.

204
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:53,394
- 怎样的隔离区  - 起点处两英里范围的每个人
- Define the quarantine zone.  - Everyone within a two mile radius of ground zero,

205
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:57,564
起点就是Kyle Singer被发现的商场
ground zero being the shopping center where Kyle Singer was last seen.

206
00:12:57,564 --> 00:13:00,734
总统阁下 我是卫生部的Nicole Duncan博士
Mr President, this is Dr Nicole Duncan at Health Services.

207
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:06,204
医疗队已就位 准备监测隔离区的人 72小时无恙后释放
Medical teams are in place and are ready to start screening and releasing people from quarantine over a 72 hour period.

208
00:13:06,204 --> 00:13:11,284
如果行动迅速 我们能减少预估的受害者人数
If we move quickly, we believe we can lower the prior casualty estimate.

209
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:13,874
- 减到什么程序  - 六万至九万人之间
- Lower to what?  - Between 60000 and 90000.

210
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:17,053
我是Wayne Palmer 嗯... 嗯...
This is Wayne Palmer. Yeah...Yeah...

211
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:21,135
- 好 谢谢你们 Dessler女士 Duncan博士...  - 总统阁下
- All right, thank you, Miss Dessler, Dr Duncan...  - Mr President.

212
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:27,419
We're about to set into motion a chain of events that will create panick

213
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:30,201
可能会引起全国恐慌 要花时间才能控制
throughout the country, that will take some time to control.

214
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:35,732
在座有谁发现计划中的疏忽 请马上提出来
If anyone here sees an option that I'm overlooking, now's the time to offer it up.

215
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:40,042
Jack Bauer想和你单独谈谈 说是急事
It's Jack Bauer. He needs to talk to you in private, and he said it's urgent.

216
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:44,922
抱歉我离开一下?
Could you all excuse me for a moment?

217
00:13:45,672 --> 00:13:48,592
现在请大家联系行动主要人员
In the meantime I want everyone to contact their key personnel,

218
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:50,882
确保他们做好了充分准备
make sure they're ready to go.

219
00:13:57,062 --> 00:14:00,522
- 什么事 Jack?  - 总统阁下 这条电话线路可靠吗?
- What is it, Jack?  - Mr President, is this line secure?

220
00:14:00,642 --> 00:14:02,192
可靠 你想说什么 Jack?
Yes. What do you need to tell me, Jack?

221
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:07,442
从价值观来说 我赞成
For what it's worth, sir, I agree with you supporting

222
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:09,902
不同恐怖分子谈判的国家政策...
this country's policy to not negotiate with terrorists...

223
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:12,992
Jack 你不会只想表达对我的赞同吧
Jack, you didn't call me to express your approval of my decision.

224
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:15,952
- 还有个选择你可参考  - 什么选择?
- I have another option for you to consider.  - Another option?

225
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:21,622
这个选择能保障国家政策的完整性 并防止恐怖事件暴发
Yes, one that, I believe, that will protect the integrity of this nation's policy and stop this outbreak from beginning.

226
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:25,382
- 我该怎么做?  - 什么都不做 阁下
- And how would I do this?  - By simply doing nothing, sir.

227
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:27,462
- 不做?  - 是的 阁下
- Nothing?  - Yes, Mr President.

228
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:30,502
可Hector Salazar会认为我们拒绝了他的要求
Hector Salazar will view that as non compliance with his demand.

229
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,302
看到他兄弟 他就不会那样想了
Not if he gets his brother back.

230
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:33,302
怎么做?
How?

231
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:36,222
找人将Ramon Salazar从监狱中救出来
Ramon Salazar would be broken out of prison and delivered to him.

232
00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:40,102
公众 尤其是恐怖分子 会以为政府拒绝恐怖分子要求
The public and, more importantly, other terrorist groups would view this as a prison break

233
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:43,142
他只好自己逃狱了
as opposed to a capitulation to their terrorist demands.

234
00:14:43,352 --> 00:14:46,522
听起来不错 Jack! 谁去把Salazar带出狱?
Sounds like quite a plan, Jack! Who breaks Salazar out?

235
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:50,152
- 我去  - 你去?
- I will, sir.  - By yourself?

236
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:52,032
我了解监狱布局 也有通行权
I know the prison and I have full access to the prisoner.

237
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:55,782
因为之前我和Salazars的瓜葛 我最有可能把他带出狱
Because of the nature of my involvement with the Salazars I can break him out and deliver him.

238
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:59,452
我在反恐局有不良记录 他们有理由相信我变节了
I have a history of insubordination with CTU, they would believe that I've switched sides.

239
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:03,042
- 我会做得很干净  - 这不像是一个人能完成的任务
- The cover story would stay clean.  - This doesn't sound like a one-man job.

240
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:06,292
为了保护您 只能一个人做
I think in order to protect you Mr President, this has to be.

241
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:08,172
我不知道 Jack
I don't know, Jack.

242
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:09,212
应该有别的办法
There has to be some other way.

243
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:12,012
不 不 剩下的时间可不多了
No, no. Not in the time that we've got left.

244
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:14,682
两小时后 Salazars会散播病毒
The Salazars are going to release the virus in the next two hours.

245
00:15:14,762 --> 00:15:17,342
不管病毒爆发初期 你控制得多好
Regardless of how successful you are at containing the initial outbreak,

246
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:21,822
它引起的民众不安 会超过你预设的所有隔离区
the resulting civil unrest will far outreach any quarantine zones you've established.

247
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:24,772
这对国家来说 是毁灭性的破坏
The damage to this country, sir, would be catastrophic.

248
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:28,692
总统阁下?
Mr President?

249
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:31,282
我需要你授权
I need your "ok" on this.

250
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:38,162
即使你成功了 我也无法保护你免受法律制裁
Even if you succeed, I won't be able to protect your legal status.

251
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:39,742
你会成为流亡犯
You'll be a fugitive.

252
00:15:40,532 --> 00:15:44,042
我明白 总统阁下 这是我最后的任务
I understand, Mr President. This will be my last assignment.

253
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:46,752
我不知该说什么
I don't know what to say.

254
00:15:46,832 --> 00:15:51,052
如果你什么都不说 阁下 我视作你同意这次行动
If you don't say anything, Mr President, I will accept that as a "go" for this mission.

255
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,142
好运 总统阁下
Good luck, Mr President.

256
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:25,202
把Duncan博士的核心报告送到我办公室
I want the information from Dr Duncan's central records in my office.

257
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,662
只给我一个人
My eyes only.

258
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:35,672
Wayne?
Wayne?

259
00:16:36,092 --> 00:16:37,842
- 你去哪儿?  - 抱歉
- Where are you going?  - Excuse me.

260
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:38,632
等等
Wait.

261
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:40,182
抱歉 Anne 我...
I'm sorry, Anne but I...

262
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:41,552
我有个约会
I have an appointment.

263
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:43,062
我快迟到了
And I am running late.

264
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,722
约会? 辩论会30分钟后开始!
An appointment? The debate starts in 30 minutes!

265
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:45,772
你去见谁?
Who are you meeting?

266
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:48,982
很抱歉 这是机密
I'm sorry again but that's confidential.

267
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:50,482
这是政府事务
It's government business.

268
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:53,362
和我前夫的事有关吗?
Does this have anything to do with my ex-husband?

269
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:59,862
我说了: 政府事务
Like I said: it's government business.

270
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,279
手术部 护士站
Surgery, nurses' station.

271
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:28,264
我是Tony Almeida的妻子Michelle 他的手术开始了吗?
Yes this is Tony Almeida's wife Michelle. I was wondering if he'd gone into surgery yet?

272
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:29,424
开始了
Yes he has.

273
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:33,289
我想告诉Landser大夫 他对青霉素过敏
I just wanted Dr Landser to know that he's allergic to penicillin.

274
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:36,169
他知道 你丈夫钱包里有过敏说明卡
Yes, he's aware of it. The allergy card was in his wallet.

275
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:37,794
现在能不能知道他的情况?
Is there a way to know how he's doing in there?

276
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,430
不行 大夫做完手术会联系你的
No but the doctor will contact you as soon as he's out of surgery.

277
00:17:41,455 --> 00:17:44,295
好的 谢谢
Ok, thank you.

278
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:48,669
什么?
Yeah?

279
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,589
隔离区概图做好了
Er, the site profiles are done.

280
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:52,719
直接发到我系统就可以了
You could have sent these to my system.

281
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:54,834
我知道 但我想亲自送过来
Yeah, I know. I wanted to come down here anyway.

282
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:56,389
为什么?
Why?

283
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:58,309
因为刚才
Because of earlier.

284
00:17:58,569 --> 00:17:59,859
刚才怎么了 Chloe?
What is it Chloe?

285
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:04,439
我想说 刚才我不知道Tony颈部中了枪
I just want you to know that I didn't know Tony had been shot in the neck,

286
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:06,109
所以态度有点不好 如果我知道
when I was insensitive earlier. And had I known

287
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:08,764
我说话就会注意一点 好吗?
I certainly would have been more careful about my choice of words, ok?

288
00:18:09,727 --> 00:18:10,767
没事的 Chloe
It's fine Chloe.

289
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:13,639
我也会提醒别人注意的 好吗
I do try to be aware of other people, you know that, don't you?

290
00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:14,794
我说了没事
I said it's fine.

291
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:16,912
好
Ok.

292
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:24,267
Gael?
Gael?

293
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:24,692
干嘛?
What?

294
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:28,625
今天和Michelle说话要注意点 她现在很脆弱
I think we should be careful about how we talk to Michelle today. She's really sensitive.

295
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:29,925
因为Tony中枪了
About Tony being shot.

296
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:30,835
在颈部
In the neck.

297
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:31,885
当然
Of course.

298
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:34,885
我想提醒大家 让你部门的人也注意点
So I'm telling everybody. Make sure everyone in your department knows.

299
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:36,765
我接电话
I've got to take this call.

300
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:37,925
是私人电话吗?
Is this a personal cell?

301
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:40,305
不能接私人电话 因为无法监控
I thought those were prohibited because they can't be monitored?

302
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:42,975
有急事我才会用 我离开一会儿
I'm using it for an emergency, I'm moving around a lot.

303
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:45,872
有人会监控来电的 我得接电话
They'll monitor it at the other end. I've really got to take this call.

304
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:54,932
喂?
Hello?

305
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:56,642
什么时候打的第二次电话?
When did you make the second call?

306
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:57,762
20分钟前
20 minutes ago.

307
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:59,932
他们会放Ramon吗?
Are they letting Ramon go or no?

308
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:01,312
还没决定
They're still deciding.

309
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:03,732
你在等什么? 他们还有不到两小时!
What are they waiting for? They have less than two hours!

310
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:06,562
我得到消息会马上通知你
I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.

311
00:19:39,472 --> 00:19:40,642
对不起!
I'm sorry!

312
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,482
不是自己的东西 不许碰!
It's not good to touch what's not yours!

313
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:47,312
- 你姐知道你在这儿吗  - 不
- Does your sister know you're here?  - No.

314
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,232
这枪上了膛 知道吗?
Did you know it was loaded?

315
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:01,912
是把好枪 对吗?
It is a nice gun, huh?

316
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:10,582
拿着 Sergio 没事
Take it, Sergio, it's ok.

317
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:20,182
喜欢这感觉吗?
You like the way it feels? Huh?

318
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,982
想按下扳机吗?
You want to pull the trigger?

319
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:28,942
想听枪声吗?
Hear the noise it makes?

320
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,902
这就是这玩意儿的力量 Sergio
That's the power of these things, Sergio.

321
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:36,942
感觉像把枪!
It feels like a gun!

322
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,822
我能用?
Can I?

323
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:46,292
当然 来吧!
Sure. Sure. Come on!

324
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,002
看那个花瓶?
You see that vase down there?

325
00:20:52,382 --> 00:20:54,842
瞄准它
Ok, now I want you to aim.

326
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:57,172
按紧扳机
And squeeze the trigger.

327
00:20:57,592 --> 00:20:59,632
慢慢地
Very slowly.

328
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:07,682
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

329
00:21:07,982 --> 00:21:09,812
出去! 滚!
Get out of here! Go! Now!

330
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:15,022
说了多少次放过他 他还是个孩子!
How many times do I have to tell you to leave him alone? He's just a boy!

331
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:16,822
想变成男人的孩子!
A boy who needs to become a man!

332
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,442
你不是他爸爸!
You're not his father!

333
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,332
你想干嘛?
What you gonna do, huh?

334
00:21:25,832 --> 00:21:27,872
朝我开枪?
You gonna shoot me?

335
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:36,802
来吧! 开枪! 朝这儿打!
Come on! Pull the trigger! Right here, come on!

336
00:21:47,352 --> 00:21:48,562
进来!
Get in there!

337
00:22:04,452 --> 00:22:06,282
你要对我们做什么?
What are you gonna do to us?

338
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:15,252
这... 这是什么?
What... What is this?

339
00:22:15,582 --> 00:22:17,172
你们要做什么?
What are you gonna do to us?

340
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:53,582
来吧
Come.

341
00:22:57,132 --> 00:23:01,552
我们还得再谈谈 你做了什么决定
We never really finished our conversation. I was just wondering what you had decided.

342
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,092
决定什么?
Decided about what?

343
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:07,222
辩论 如何对付我前夫
The debate. What to do about my ex-husband.

344
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:16,562
刚才我碰到Wayne 我知道他不喜欢我 但这次不同 他在躲避我...
I ran into Wayne a few minutes ago. I know he's never liked me but this was different. He was avoiding me and...

345
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:21,902
我有种感觉 让我无法动弹
I had a feeling I wasn't able to shake.

346
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:23,362
什么感觉?
What kind of feeling?

347
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:32,952
你付钱让Ted闭嘴! 我说得对吗 David?
That you're paying Ted to keep quiet! Is that what you're doing, David?

348
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:38,382
有时为了正确的理由 不得不做错误的事
Sometimes you have to do the wrong thing for the right reason.

349
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:42,212
怎么能付钱给一个撒谎的人? 这不对
How can you reward someone for threatening you with a lie? That's wrong.

350
00:23:42,502 --> 00:23:46,092
如果我想留任 就必须考虑现实的政治问题
There are political realities I have to consider if I want to stay in office.

351
00:23:46,182 --> 00:23:47,762
如果能让你感觉好点... 我告诉你...
I'll tell you something... If it makes you feel better...

352
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:52,262
不会让我感觉好! 这只是事实
It doesn't make me feel better! It just happens to be the truth.

353
00:23:55,602 --> 00:24:01,282
Anne, I have been in this job for nearly four years.

354
00:24:02,102 --> 00:24:07,282
And I have learnt the hard way that there are no absolutes. Sometimes you have to make compromises...

355
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:12,702
政治上是这样! 但如果和道德有关... David 你要明确界线
Politically, yes! But when it comes to morality... David, you have to draw the line.

356
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:16,412
我有界限 只是我俩在界限的两边!
I have drawn the line. We're just standing on different sides!

357
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:22,092
你让人感到害怕
You're running scared.

358
00:24:22,382 --> 00:24:26,092
我努力留在办公室 为支持我的人民服务
I am fighting to stay in office and serve the people that put me here.

359
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:31,552
那就用事实迎战Keeler的谎言 相信人民能够明辨是非
Then face Keeler's lie with the truth and trust that the people will be able to tell the difference.

360
00:24:32,602 --> 00:24:34,062
没那么容易!
It's not that easy!

361
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:38,022
你从没做过哪件事是容易的 你一直在做正确的事
You've never been about what's easy. You've been about what's right.

362
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:43,022
那才是你 人民选举那样的你领导大家
That's who you are. That's who the people elected to lead them.

363
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:51,782
那才是值得我爱的你
And for what it's worth, that's who I fell in love with.

364
00:24:56,082 --> 00:24:58,042
我...
I was...

365
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,632
我是想保护你
I was trying to protect you.

366
00:25:02,712 --> 00:25:04,002
保护我?
Protect me?

367
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:08,632
你不仅会受到Keeler的指责! 还要遭受媒体的检审
This won't end with Keeler's allegation! You're gonna be in the media's cross hairs.

368
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:10,432
我习惯于接受公众监审
I am used to public scrutiny.

369
00:25:10,472 --> 00:25:15,472
这次不同 会比你想像的丑陋许多
Not like this! This will be different. And much uglier than you can imagine.

370
00:25:16,142 --> 00:25:18,732
我会为自己辩护
I can defend myself.

371
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:44,752
David?
David?

372
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,422
和Packard联系上了吗?
Have you made contact with Packard?

373
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:47,882
马上
Just going to.

374
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:49,972
和他在一起吗?
Are you with him now?

375
00:25:50,052 --> 00:25:51,932
还没 他刚到 怎么了?
No, he's coming over now. Why?

376
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:55,052
离开那儿
Walk away.

377
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:56,642
什么?
What?

378
00:25:56,762 --> 00:25:58,222
你听得很清楚
You heard me.

379
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,352
David 我们商量过 你打算掩盖这些事 记得吗?
David, we've been through this. Now, you decided to bury this thing, remember?

380
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:02,942
我改变主意了
I've changed my mind.

381
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:05,152
Anne和你谈过了?
Anne talked to you, didn't she?

382
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:08,282
Wayne! 离开那儿
Wayne! Walk away.

383
00:26:46,802 --> 00:26:48,352
你找我?
You wanted to see me?

384
00:26:48,562 --> 00:26:53,192
我找Chloe和Adam谈过 如果你想去医院陪Tony 我们来替你
I've spoken to Chloe, and Adam, and we'll cover for you if you want to go to the hospital to be with Tony.

385
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:54,130
替我?
Cover for me?

386
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,325
我们知道... 你脑子一定很乱
Well, we know... You've got a lot on your mind right now.

387
00:26:56,522 --> 00:26:57,822
我没事 Gael!
I'm fine Gael!

388
00:26:57,862 --> 00:26:58,732
我们觉得...
We just thought...

389
00:26:58,772 --> 00:27:02,712
Michelle 危机出现后我处理了Chloe 30%的分析工作
Look, Michelle. I've been taking 30% of Chloe's load since the bio-threat came in.

390
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:04,912
我能处理一半的分析工作
I can handle half of COM's load as well.

391
00:27:04,937 --> 00:27:09,607
我们只需要知道密码 免得在进入系统时浪费时间
We just need the right user password on district servers so we won't be slowed down by request authorization.

392
00:27:09,632 --> 00:27:14,102
这是Joe Tommisello负责的 为了安全起见 他设置了用户延迟24小时权限
It's Joe Tommisello's area, he put a 24 hour delay on user logs because of security problems we've been having.

393
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:16,205
要不我打给Joe 让他开通权限?
So what if I call Joe and get him to wait for us?

394
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,940
我试过了 找不到他
I tried that, he's unreachable.

395
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:19,767
还有别的办法吗?
Is there any other way to do this?

396
00:27:20,632 --> 00:27:25,682
增加人手 至少再要四个系统分析员来解密
More bodies. We need at least four more system radi-analysts to take on work we've been doing.

397
00:27:25,802 --> 00:27:27,932
我打电话叫人过来 尽早开始工作
I can make some calls, get the next shift in early.

398
00:27:28,102 --> 00:27:30,892
我试过了 等他们过来也迟了
I've already tried that. By the time they got here it would be too late.

399
00:27:31,102 --> 00:27:33,892
我很感谢大家 但这办法行不通
Look, I appreciate this but it's not gonna happen.

400
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:37,562
都回去工作吧
So let's get back to work.

401
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,032
Michelle!
Michelle!

402
00:27:46,112 --> 00:27:50,162
我同意 没有领导我们做不好工作
Listen, I agree. We can't run this place by committy.

403
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,832
让我接替你 Adam和Chloe做原来的工作
Let me step in for you. Adam and Chloe can stay at their posts.

404
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:53,752
你的工作怎么办?
What about yours?

405
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:57,422
我在Langley时 接替过当时的长官几次 干得不错
When I was at Langley, I filled out for my period chief a couple of times and we got through it.

406
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:02,382
当时有病毒威胁吗? 总统当天也在城市么?
Was there a bio-threat? President in town all in one day?

407
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:04,132
谢谢你 Gael
Thank you anyway, Gael.

408
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:13,892
反恐局 Bauer?
CTU, Bauer?

409
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,812
Kim 我是爸 你在干吗?
Kim, it's your dad, what are you doing right now?

410
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:19,612
还在分析Salazar手下来电的来源
I'm still trying to locate a point of origin on that phone call from Salazar's people.

411
00:28:19,652 --> 00:28:22,692
听着 先帮我做点事 不会花多少时间
Ok, look, I'm gonna need you to do something for me first, it's not gonna take long.

412
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:26,362
- 什么事?  - 制作一份囚犯转移文件
- What?  - I need you to generate a prisoner transfer document.

413
00:28:26,362 --> 00:28:30,282
注意文件格式 抬头写"联邦授权移交"
Look in your file form, under the heading "Federal Transit Authorization".

414
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:32,202
用来干嘛?
What's this about?

415
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:34,502
我要转移Ramon Salazar
I need to move Ramon Salazar.

416
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,411
为什么要转移他?
Why are you gonna move him?

417
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,878
Kim 这事得到了优先许可权
Kim, this has been given priority clearance.

418
00:28:38,878 --> 00:28:41,968
反恐局其它人都不知道 所以我只信任你 让你帮我做
No-one in CTU's supposed to know. That's why you're the only person I can trust to do this for me.

419
00:28:41,968 --> 00:28:43,428
快帮忙吧
So, please, help.

420
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:47,048
好的 要输入许可证密码
Ok. It's asking for a clearance code.

421
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,719
是*99
It's: *99.

422
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:52,036
还要一个进入密码
Now it wants a pass-word.

423
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:55,771
Lincoln 65 FGA.
Lincoln 65 FGA

很好
Ok, good.

426
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:13,213
Kim 今早你到我办公室 告诉我一些对你很重要的事
Look, Kim, I know you tried to come up to my office earlier today to talk to me about something that was really important to you.

427
00:29:13,213 --> 00:29:16,593
我不是很赞同 我只是...
And I know I wasn't very supportive and I just wanted to...

428
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:17,923
不用说这些 爸
You don't have to do this, dad.

429
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,633
宝贝 我要说 我想告诉你我很抱歉
Sweetheart, I do. I need to tell you I'm sorry.

430
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,933
我知道我对你保护过度
I know that I'm awfully protective of you.

431
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:30,603
近两年发生了太多事情... 我不想你再受伤害
I just watched so many things happen to you over the last few years... I don't want you to get hurt anymore.

432
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:34,563
其实 我相信你 相信你的眼光
The fact is, I trust you, I trust your jugement.

433
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:40,073
希望你明白 你的每一个选择 我都会支持
I need you to know that anything that you ever chose to do I would support you in.

434
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:41,271
好吗?
Ok?

435
00:29:41,271 --> 00:29:43,231
谢谢 这些话对我很重要
Thanks that means a lot to me.

436
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:50,411

438
00:29:56,036 --> 00:29:56,706

马上发给Downey的典狱长Mitchell

460
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:53,485
不! 你听我说 Jack
No! Listen to me, Jack.

461
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:58,535
我知道你生我和Kim的气 我理解 但你不能不让我工作!
I know you're angry about me and Kim, I get that! But I'm not gonna let you stop me from doing my job!

462
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:00,905
你的工作就是服从的我命令!
YOUR JOB IS TO FOLLOW MY ORDERS!

463
00:31:00,915 --> 00:31:04,475
你无权命令我!
You're in no condition to give me orders!

Jack, look. You know I respect you but you also know I've been covering for you.

Since you've been back, I've been keeping the fact

467
00:31:13,865 --> 00:31:16,565

that you're a junkie from Kim and everybody else at CTU!

468
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,675
我不会再这样做了 我受够了
I'm not doing it anymore. I'm done.

469
00:31:18,675 --> 00:31:19,715
Chase?

让他按程序离开这里
Get this guy processed and get him out of here.

00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:41,325
我知道必须要有许可证 但你马上让我见Salazar
Have division follow up for written authorization but you need to let me see Salazar now.

475
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:44,825
Salazar买通了两个杀手 没有许可证谁也不许见他
Salazar's been buying two murders today. Nobody gets close to him without full paperwork.

476
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:46,835
你不明白今天发生了什么?
You don't understand what's happening today?

477
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:48,835
Salazar是我们的线索
Our Salazar has information that I need.

478

这是我的部门 我必须知道
This is my facility. I need to know.

481
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:59,005
我们遭到恐怖威胁 Salazar的弟弟在幕后操纵
We're dealing with major terrorist threat. Salazar's brother is behind it.

482
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:04,265

Go ahead and confirm with division if you want to. But hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake, here.

这三个月来 Jack和我一周来这儿两次
Now, Jack and I have been coming here twice a week for the last three months.

484
00:32:07,965 --> 00:32:12,565
Salazar一直通过搪塞 律师 诉讼程序阻挠我们
Salazar's prevented us from doing our job with his stalling and his lawyers and his due process.

485
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:14,195
我们没时间浪费了...
We don't have time for that...

486
00:32:14,195 --> 00:32:17,985
我要和他单独谈谈 马上
I need to go one on one with him, right now.

487
00:32:19,025 --> 00:32:24,865

He's in isolation cell in B block. Come on, I'll take you.

488
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:35,335
- 摄像头?  - 对 3个
- Surveillance cameras?  - Yeah, 3.

489
00:32:35,335 --> 00:32:36,565
关掉它们
Get them turned off.

490
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:37,795
这不合规矩
It's against regulations.

491
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:40,255
我保证不会留下痕迹
Won't be any marks, I promise.

492
00:32:41,977 --> 00:32:43,057
你有30分钟
You get 30 minutes.

493
00:32:48,474 --> 00:32:52,275
我是典狱长Mitchell 关闭B区监视系统
This is warden Mitchell. I need you to go black on isolation B.

494
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:53,665
多久 先生?
For how long, sir?

495
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:55,065
到时候通知你
Until further notice.

496
00:33:14,335 --> 00:33:15,505
你真是死缠烂打!
You're a tough guy, huh!

497
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:20,676
打我有什么后果 你不怕?
You are not worried of what might happen if you lay a finger on me?

498
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:26,475
好吧... 你不怕 我也不怕
Ok... If you're not worried, neither am I.

499
00:33:31,395 --> 00:33:33,275
开始害怕跟我说一声
Let me know when you start to worry.

500
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:53,496
Kyle Singer在哪儿?
Where's Kyle Singer?

501
00:33:53,496 --> 00:33:55,456
我说了 我不知道!
I told you, I don't know!

502
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:57,481
告诉我谁知道!
You're gonna tell me who does!

503
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,336

让他回牢房
Put him in his cell.

505
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,940
你在这儿干嘛 Jack?
What are you doing here, Jack?

506
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,445
我们没有选择了
We're running out of options.

507
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:15,516
找不到Singer 现在Salazar是我们唯一线索 你是对的
We can't find Singer. Salazar's our only hope. You were right.

508
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:18,566
撬开他的嘴比想像的难 不如我们...
He's tougher to break than I thought. Maybe two of us can...

509
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:18,936
好
Yeah.

510
00:34:18,936 --> 00:34:20,896
Jack 我刚才说的话...
Look, Jack, about what I said before...

511
00:34:23,816 --> 00:34:28,656
- 忘掉吧  - 我们和好了?
- Forget about it.  - So we're ok? You and me?

512
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:33,264
对 和好了
Yeah, we're ok.

513
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:35,718
监视器在哪儿
Tell me about the security cameras.

514
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:36,548
关掉了
They're disabled.

515
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:38,008
很好
Good.

516
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:40,888
把他带出来
Get him out of his cell.

517
00:35:01,276 --> 00:35:03,276
你要杀我吗 Jack?
Are you gonna kill me, now, Jack?

518
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:12,181
很想 但不能 如果你表现好 Ramon 我会带你出监狱
I'd love to, but I can't. If you play this cool, Ramon, you're walking out of here with me now.

519
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:14,746
几小时后 你就能见到你兄弟
You'll be with your brother in the next couple of hours.

520
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,166
拖他进去
Now, grab his feet.

521
00:35:29,886 --> 00:35:31,596
面对墙壁
Turn and face the wall.

522
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:55,656
感觉怎么样 Anne...
How are you gonna feel, Anne...

523
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:57,666
如果David为了你输掉竞选?
if David loses this election because of you?

524
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,868
我认为不太可能
I don't think that's very likely.

525
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:06,176
你真不知道自己在说什么 是吗?
Mmm. Then you really don't know what you're talking about, do you?

526
00:36:06,176 --> 00:36:08,716
这份陈述 会让他输掉这场辩论
Because this allegation may cost him this debate.

527
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:11,256
赢了辩论 才能赢选举
And David needs this debate to win this election.

528
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:12,806
这是勒索
It was blackmail.

529
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:16,386
David决定付钱了 你却让他改变了主意!
And David made the decision to pay. It wasn't up to you to change his mind!

530
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:21,459
如果他认为自己是对的 是不会改变主意的
If he believed the decision was right, he wouldn't have changed his mind.

531
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:23,995
问题是 你无法接受事实
The problem is, you can't stand the fact

532
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,016
你兄弟想和我过一辈子
that your brother wants me in his life.

533
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:29,091
因为你让他分心
Because you're a distraction to him.

534
00:36:29,635 --> 00:36:31,456
你是个妨碍
And you're a liability.

535
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,051
跟谁比? Sherry?
Compared to whom? Sherry?

536
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,026
我不会在这儿为Sherry辩护 她是有点出轨
I'm not gonna sit here and try and defend Sherry. She went off the rails.

537
00:36:38,206 --> 00:36:40,996
但至少她知道游戏规则 她了解David
But at least she understood the game, and she understood David. She was with him

538
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:42,836
他们在一起20多年
for over 20 years.

539
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:45,266
我和他一起的时间足够久 我了解他是什么人
I have been with him long enough to know the kind of man he is.

540
00:36:45,266 --> 00:36:47,506
你根本不了解他
You don't know anything about him

541
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:50,296
或者你不了解这世界的生存法则
or what it takes to survive in the world he lives in.

542
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:55,924
我们有分歧 Wayne 一直如此
We disagree, Wayne. We always have.

543
00:36:56,421 --> 00:37:01,911
Anne 我不会眼睁睁看着你毁掉他的事业
Anne, I will not stand by and watch you jeopardize everything that he's worked for.

544
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:03,896
我不会
I won't do it.

545
00:37:07,196 --> 00:37:09,656
我不是那么容易被吓倒的
I don't scare easily.

546
00:37:37,926 --> 00:37:42,146
怎么了 Jack? 自从你把我送进来 我不相信会你放我出去
What's happening, Jack? After all you went through to put me in here, I can't believe you're letting me out!

547
00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:43,106
闭嘴
Shut up.

548
00:37:43,106 --> 00:37:46,026
我不相信你叛变 你不是这样的人
I don't believe you sold out. It's not your nature.

549
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:52,446
为什么打晕那孩子? 你的政府屈服了但不承认? 是这样吗?
But then, why knock out the kid? Did your government cave, but can't admit it? Is that what happened?

550
00:37:55,196 --> 00:37:58,616
你可没那么好 Jack 你是杂种!
You don't look so good, Jack. That's a bitch!

551
00:37:58,616 --> 00:38:02,166
想出去吗? 那就闭上嘴照我说的做
You wanna get out of here? You'll keep your mouth shut and do what I say.

552
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,206
明白吗?
You understand me?

553
00:38:05,796 --> 00:38:07,546
我们能通过了吗
We've been cleared to pass.

554
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:10,716
典狱长想见你 马上就到
The warden wants to see you first. He'll be here in a minute.

555
00:38:10,716 --> 00:38:11,546
好
Ok.

556
00:38:30,196 --> 00:38:31,946
不许动
Don't you move.

557
00:38:31,946 --> 00:38:35,156
抱歉久等了 Jack
Sorry to keep you waiting, Jack.

558
00:38:35,156 --> 00:38:36,326
什么事?
What's the problem?

559
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:38,276
这份转移令的密码
The access codes of this transfer order.

560
00:38:38,626 --> 00:38:41,076
和监狱局签发的不一致
They don't correspond to the ones assigned by the bureau of prisons.

561
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:44,786
分区替换了这些密码 反恐小组有加前缀码的权利
Division superseded those access codes. CTU has a mandate to prefix.

562
00:38:44,786 --> 00:38:46,166
这是昨天的前缀码
This is yesterday's prefix.

563
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:48,336
见鬼
Son of a bitch.

564
00:38:48,336 --> 00:38:50,586
肯定是我办公室的人弄错了
Someone in my office must have screwed up.

565
00:38:50,586 --> 00:38:52,966
我们马上把正确前缀码给你
Look, we'll get you the proper prefix retroactively.

566
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:57,556
听着 我知道恐怖威胁的事 Edmunds探员已经告诉我了
Look, I know about the terrorist threat. Agent Edmunds told me.

567
00:38:58,846 --> 00:39:01,726
这就是为什么我们要转移犯人
That's exactly why we need to move the prisoner now.

568
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:04,346
这是最高机密 抱歉我不能告诉你
It's classified priority one, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

569
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:07,856
我不能为了繁琐的程序浪费任何时间
But I can't afford to lose any time over some small technical detail.

570
00:39:07,856 --> 00:39:10,026
拜托 Kevin 帮个忙
Come on, Kevin, help me out.

571
00:39:10,026 --> 00:39:12,066
Edmunds探员呢?
Where's agent Edmunds?

572
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:16,156
正在搜犯人的牢房 看能不能找到些线索
He's conducting a search of the prisoner's cell. Trying to find some additional information.

573
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:19,176
他跟着就出来 他会完成相关文件工作
He'll be right behind me, he can help you out with the paperwork.

574
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:22,406
好 带上你的徽章 准备通行
Right, pick up your badge and go to receiving.

575
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:24,456
谢谢 我们会尽快
Thanks, we'll hurry out.

576
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:32,126
走
Move.

577
00:39:50,436 --> 00:39:52,566
请打开3号隔离牢房监视系统
Turn on isolation 3, please.

578
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:00,906
怎么回事?
What the hell?

579
00:40:00,906 --> 00:40:03,206
有人动了摄像头 角度不对
Someone turned the camera, the angle's wrong.

580
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:04,916
让Binge到隔离区来见我
Get Binge to meet me in isolation.

581
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:09,086
开门
Door.

582
00:40:20,346 --> 00:40:21,466
面对墙壁
Face the wall.

583
00:40:25,436 --> 00:40:29,076
我是Bauer探员 能拿我的枪和徽章了吗?
Agent Bauer. Can I get my gun and a badge?

584
00:40:48,456 --> 00:40:49,746
开门!
Open it!

585
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:56,966
开门!
Door!

586

Kind of hot today!

587
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,076
是啊 快烧着了!
Yeah, I'm burning!

588
00:41:06,476 --> 00:41:08,476
不管Bauer说了什么 都是撒谎! 快!
Whatever Bauer told you, he's lying! Come on!

589
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:12,476
给 看看你的枪
Here you are, check your gun.

590
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:13,106

00:41:38,756 --> 00:41:44,306
3级警报 封锁全部牢房
Security 3, get a block of the whole ward.

594
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:47,536
解除封锁全部牢房 快!
Open the cell blocks, now!

595
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:48,926
在这儿没法解除
I can't do it from here.

596
00:41:48,936 --> 00:41:50,516
你不怕没命吗?
Is it worth losing your life over?

597
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:53,035
