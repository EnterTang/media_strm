00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:18,251
今天所发生的一切 从医疗中心的感染尸体
Sir, everything that's happened today from the infected body at Health Services

00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:22,001
到Ramon Salazar的越狱都属于一次精心策划的苦肉计
through Ramon Salazar's prison break has been a part of an elaborate sting operation.

3
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:22,961
总统先生
Mr. President,

4
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:27,131
一小撮乌克兰的科学正试图在黑市上销售一种武器化病毒
a group of scientists from the Ukraine were trying to sell a weaponized virus on the open market

5
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:29,531
我而我推荐了Salazar组织
and I suggested the Salazars as potential buyers.

6
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:32,611
我们的目的是在市场上根除货源
Our goal was to remove the virus stock pile from the marketplace.

7
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:35,001
成败的先决条件是
But all of this hinged on me convincing the Salazars

8
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,701
让Salazar兄弟我已经叛变了
that I had switched sides.

9
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:39,451
告诉我 这叛徒怎么会成了我们朋友
Tell me how the man who betrayed us is now our friend.

10
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,871
Bauer给我送来一个机会
Bauer came to me with an opportunity

11
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:43,351
能挣很多钱
to make more money

12
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,131
多到我们无法想象
than we have ever dreamed of.

13
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:46,901
这对你有什么好处 Jack?
What's in it for you, Jack?

14
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:48,471
1千5百万美金
$15 million.

15
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:51,971
我从来没想过Jack Bauer会为钱干事
I would never have thought that Jack Bauer was for sale.

16
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:55,221
你说过你会带我离开这里
You said you'd take me away from here.

17
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,111
还记得么 Jack?
Do you remember, Jack?

18
00:00:57,251 --> 00:00:58,901
是的 我还记得
Yes, I remember.

19
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:01,311
其实你只有一件事没有明说...
There was one small thing you forgot to mention.

20
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,841
你是个警察
You are a cop.

21
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:06,621
但是我不在乎这 只要你还能记住一丁点承诺
But even that wouldn't matter if you'd meant half the things you said to me

22
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:08,611
我对你所说的话 都是真心诚意的
I meant everything I ever said to you.

23
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:10,411
往后的几小时里
For the next few hours,

24
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:14,551
我们要倾尽一切资源帮助Jack Bauer阻截病毒
all of our resources are dedicated to helping Jack Bauer intercept this virus.

25
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:16,811
Tony 我和Chase通过话
Tony, I spoke to Chase.

26
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,421
他不会回到反恐局
He's not coming back to CTU.

27
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:21,181
Chase依旧认为我父亲是被Salazar他们绑架了
He still thinks my father was captured by the Salazars.

28
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:23,341
因此他要前往拯救Jack.
And he thinks he's going in to rescue Jack.

29
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:25,521
该死的! 如果他一去 Jack的身份就暴露了
Damn it. If he goes in there, he's going to blow Jack's cover.

30
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:26,871
那我们就拿不到病毒了
We're going to lose this virus.

31
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:28,481
我认识他
I know this man.

32
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:30,091
他是Bauer的搭档
Bauer's partner!

33
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,241
这到底是怎么回事 Jack?
What the hell's going on here, Jack?

34
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:32,391
闭嘴 Chase!
Shut up, Chase!

35
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:33,811
你根本不该跟踪我
You should never have followed me down here.

36
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:36,881
- 你和他们一伙了?  - 没错
- You with them?  - Yes, I'm with them.

37
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:43,161
- Jack  - 闭嘴 Chase!
- Jack.  - Shut up, Chase.

38
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:44,871
你如果还想活命 就给我闭嘴!
You want to get through this, just shut up!

39
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:49,081
Jack的手表发信器坏了
The transponder in Jack's watch just went dead.

40
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:50,251
该死的!
Damn it!

41
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,171
即使突击部队就位
By the time the assault teams are in position,

42
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,891
我们也根本不知道他身在何处
we'll have no idea where he is.

43
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,311
女士们先生们 总统将会宣布简短公告
Ladies And Gentlemen, the President will make a brief statement.

44
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,951
不设提问
There will be no questions at this time.

45
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:26,891
我亲爱的美国人民 晚上好
My fellow americans, good evening.

46
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:28,241
几小时前
A few hours ago,

47
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:30,531
我不得不中止 总统竞选辩论
I had to terminate the presidential debate

48
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:32,811
来处理手头要事
in order to handle what was at the time

49
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:35,241
一项国家安全问题
a national security threat.

50
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:37,221
我目前无法向你们透露
I can't reveal to you at this time

51
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:39,391
情况的细节
for the details surrounding the situation.

52
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:42,331
几小时后 一切都将水落石出
Those will be forthcoming in the next few hours.

53
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:47,541
但我保证几小时前的危机已经不复存在
Let me assure you that the danger that existed a few hours ago has passed.

54
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:50,071
美国安全了
America is safe,

55
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:53,021
美国人民也安全了
the American people are safe.

56
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:56,671
我向我的竞选对手 参议员Keeler以及
I apologize to my opponent, Senator Keeler,

57
00:02:56,671 --> 00:03:02,091
期待看到我们辩论的上百万民众表示歉意
and to the millions of you who were expecting to see the two of us engaged in the issues.

58
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:04,371
辩论将择日再举行
The debate will be rescheduled.

59
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:07,631
我向各位的耐心及宽容表示谢意
I'd like to thank you all for your patience and understanding.

60
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,941
- 晚安  - 总统先生
- Good night.  - Mr. Prident, Mr. President,

61
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:13,081
有流言说此次危机是由您的官员所捏造
there have been rumors that this crisis was manufactured by your administration

62
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:15,581
意图袒护您的朋友 Anne Packard医生
to protect your friend, Dr. Anne Packard.

63
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:17,671
您对此怎么看?
How do you respond to that, sir?

64
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:24,001
这些传言是捏造的
Those allegations were false.

65
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:27,461
参议员Keeler的指控是空穴来风 我们有证据
Senator Keeler's charges were unfounded and we have proof.

66
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:30,801
由Anne Packard的前夫所提供
Proof that comes directly from Anne Packard's ex-husband.

67
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:33,581
事实上 之后一段时间里
In fact, in the next few days and weeks,

68
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,641
参议员Keeler得想法自圆其说
Senator Keeler will have his own explaining to do.

69
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:41,921
Anne Packard是一个正直善良的人
Anne Packard is an individual of the utmost integrity.

70
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:44,081
她不应受到如此待遇
She didn't deserve this.

71
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:45,921
总统先生!
Mr. President!

72
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:47,671
谢谢 女士们先生们
Thank you. Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen.

73
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:49,431
到此为止 提问结束 谢谢
That's it. No more questions. Thank you.

74
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,741
Bauer和Salazar兄弟在墨西哥
Bauer's with the Salazar brothers in Mexico.

75
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,971
他的跟踪器失灵了
His transponder signal has stopped working.

76
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:57,531
我们要竭尽所能联系上他
We're doing everything we can to reestablish contact.

77
00:03:57,531 --> 00:04:00,581
让特种部队在收到我消息前 原地待命
Tell the Delta units to hold their positions till I get back to you.

78
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:02,381
对 谢谢
Right. Thanks.

79
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:07,651
为什么我们不试试增幅器?
Why don't we try an amplification module?

80
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:09,641
我已经试了3次了
I've already cycled through it three times.

81
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,621
不是信号薄弱 而是根本没有
It's not a weak signal, there's no signal.

82
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:13,391
我们觉得有哪些可能性?
What do we think happened here?

83
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:16,121
很有可能Jack的身份被揭穿了
There's a strong possibility that Jack's cover might have been blown.

84
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,031
没有任何征兆说明他的跟踪器被发现
There's no indication that his transponder's been found

85
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:20,051
或者他的身份败露
or that his cover's been blown.

86
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:21,901
有可能他所在的地方发不出信号
It may be either he's in a place where we can't get the signal

87
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:23,411
或者他的跟踪器坏了
or the transponder's broken.

88
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:25,841
部分受损可能会改变其原有频率
Partial damage might have knocked it to another frequency.

89
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:27,861
- 扫描一下频带  - 我正在干
- Let's run a scan.  - I'm doing that now.

90
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:30,891
到现在为止只查了三分之一 但是到目前为止没有找到
I'm only a third of the way through the spectrum, but so far, no luck.

91
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:33,081
好吧 我会找人帮你
All right, I'll get you some help.

92
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,201
Kim.
Kim

93
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:38,451
- 怎么 Tony?  - 你知道怎么进行频带扫描么?
- Yes, Tony?  - Do you know how to do a frequency scan?

94
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:39,331
知道
Yeah.

95
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:42,361
好吧 我们试图搜索你父亲的跟踪器信号
Okay. We're trying to pick up your father's transponder signal.

96
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:44,431
Michelle已经在搜索了 配合她
Michelle's already begun the scan. Coordinate with her.

97
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:47,861
- 署名是什么?  - 我已经说过了30/5
- What's the signature?  - I already told you... 30 over five.

98
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:49,741
你没说过
You didn't tell me.

99
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,371
听着 Kim
Look, Kim.

100
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,771
我知道你不好过
I know it's hard on you...

101
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:54,211
你父亲生死未卜
your father's life being at stake...

102
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,141
但是你得集中注意力 明白?
but I need you to focus, okay?

103
00:04:56,311 --> 00:04:57,771
抱歉
Sorry.

104
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,351
就这样
All right, good.

105
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,741
如果有什么消息 告诉我
Call me if anything changes.

106
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,671
为什么我们停在这儿?
Why are we stopped?

107
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:20,971
Tomas说我们没被跟踪
Tomas says there is no sign of anyone following us.

108
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:23,271
在我们了解到更多前 我们最好呆在这儿
Until we know more, we're better off staying here.

109
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:30,401
他会不会是孤身前来?
Would he have come here on his own without backup?

110
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,181
也许他想独自救你
Maybe he came by himself to rescue you.

111
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:35,511
太可怜了
How sad.

112
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:39,111
你难过么 Jack 你搭档因为救你而死?
Does it bother you, Jack, that your partner's going to die, trying to save you?

113
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:40,811
很难过
It breaks me up.

114
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:45,901
然后灭口
Then kill him.

115
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,661
那个叫Amador的 应该已经打电话安排会面了
This man Amador should have called by now to set up the meeting.

116
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:53,161
他会联系的 别担心
He's going to call, don't worry.

117
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:54,641
只要你准备好钱
Just make sure you got your money ready.

118
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:55,931
钱已经准备好了
The money's ready.

119
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:02,501
喂?
Yeah?

120
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:04,041
我是Amador
It's Amador.

121
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,241
我们准备好了
We're ready.

122
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,701
哪儿见?
Where?

123
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,261
让Bauer接电话
Put Bauer on the phone.

124
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:09,811
我只和他谈
I only deal with him.

125
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,801
我是Jack
This is Jack.

126
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:23,591
Jack 小镇北面5公里处 有通往丛林的岔道
Hi, Jack. Five kilometers north of the town, the trail splits off the road into the woods.

127
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:26,231
沿着那条路2公里 15分钟路程
Take the two kilometers. 15 minutes.

128
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,511
明白
Got it.

129
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:30,721
接头点在这里北面 15分钟内赶到
The meeting's north of here in 15 minutes.

130
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:34,701
等下
Wait.

131
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,231
给我电话
The phone.

132
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:38,561
如果他打回来呢?
What if he calls back?

133
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:40,621
我会留言
I'll take a message.

134
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,481
看看你 Jack 你看起来糟透了
Look at you, Jack. You are a mess.

135
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:50,821
我们得帮你收拾干净 不然你肯定挺不过去
We got to get you straight or you'll never get through this.

136
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,391
我不使用毒品
I'm not gonna fix.

137
00:06:57,691 --> 00:06:58,781

138
00:06:58,781 --> 00:07:00,191

我希望你睡会

142
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:26,711
- 我不累  - 走的时候 我会叫醒你的
- I'm not tired.  - I'll wake you when it's time to leave.

143
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,691
- Hector呢?  - 他很忙
- Where's Hector?  - He's busy.

144
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:30,571
明天早上你就能看到他
You'll see him tomorrow morning.

145
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,641
睡吧
Go to sleep.

146
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,191
我爱你
I love you.

147
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:46,971
Claudia 坐下!
Claudia, sit down!

148
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:48,701
坐下!
Sit down!

149
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:55,011
我要你仔细听我说
I need you to listen to me.

150
00:07:57,071 --> 00:08:00,151
Hector和Ramon要购买细菌武器
Hector and Ramon are trying to buy a virus to use as a weapon.

151
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:01,781
上百万人会因此死去
Millions of people could die.

152
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,421
我安排这场交易 帮助美国政府控制病毒并消灭它
I've set up this deal so my government can take control of the virus and destroy it.

153
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:06,621
你明白我在说什么?
Do you understand what I'm saying?

154
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:08,181
你还在为反恐局干?
You're still with CTU?

155
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:09,741
是的 我还是属于反恐局的
Yes, I'm still with CTU.

156
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:11,551
但是你帮Ramon越狱了
But you broke Ramon out of prison.

157
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,361
这样我才能得到他的信任
That was so I could gain his trust,

158
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:14,571
来进行这场交易
to make the deal happen.

159
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:17,761
我不能让病毒落入魔掌
I cannot allow this virus to get into the wrong hands.

160
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:20,531
你骗了我们一次 现在你又要欺骗我们?
You betrayed us once, now you've come to betray us again?

161
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,801
是骗他们 不是骗你
No, it's them, not you.

162
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:24,771
我像一个笨蛋一样轻信
I was a fool to believe any of it.

163
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,961
我会保护你 并把你家人送到安全地带
I'm going to protect you and going to get your family somewhere safe.

164
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:30,621
- 撒谎  - 我很早就想回来找你
- All lies.  - I wanted to come back for you earlier,

165
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:33,641
但是当我听到病毒问题 我得优先处理这个
but when I heard about this virus, I had to deal with it.

166
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:36,671
几百万人性命攸关 你得明白这点
Millions of lives are at stake. You have to understand that.

167
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,721
这次我可以把你带出去
But I can get you out now.

168
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,081
你 Sergio和你父亲
You, Sergio and your father.

169
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:47,991
- 怎么做?  - 美国士兵离这儿不远
- How?  - American soldiers are not far from here.

170
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,881
他们在等我消息 但是我联系不到他们
They're waiting for my signal, but I can't reach them

171
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:52,401
因为我的跟踪器坏了
because my transmitter's been destroyed.

172
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:53,511
Claudia
Claudia,

173
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:56,611
骗你对我没有好处
I have nothing to gain from telling you this if it's not the truth.

174
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:59,241
只要你一句话 我就死路一条
One word from you and I'm a dead man.

175
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,011
你要我做什么?
What do you want me to do?

176
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:09,671
首先 我需要手机 我得和反恐局联系 报告我的位置
First, I need a cell phone. I need to let CTU know where I am.

177
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:12,131
然后 我要你尽量
Then I need you to do whatever you can

178
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:14,051
帮助我的搭档 Chase
to help my partner Chase,

179
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:16,221
- 让他活着  - 不行 Hector一旦发现
- to keep him alive.  - No, when Hector realizes it,

180
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:18,391
- 我就活不了了  - 那时我们早就远走高飞了
- he's going to kill me.  - We'll be gone by then.

181
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,021
Chase可以帮你逃出去
Chase can help you get out,

182
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:21,721
我保证
I promise.

183
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:23,901
但是如果我联系不上反恐局 这一切就都完了
But if I can't contact CTU, this is all for nothing.

184
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:26,201
你得给我电话
You've got to get me that phone.

185
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:28,761
求你了
Please.

186
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:30,751
我会尽力的
I'll do what I can.

187
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,451
我得走了 他们正等着我
I have to go. They're waiting for me.

188
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:52,671
如果你再骗我
If you're lying to me again,

189
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:54,561
我就亲手杀了你
I'll kill you myself.

190
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:00,671
去救Chase
Help Chase.

191
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:19,451
Jack Bauer帮Ramon越狱
Jack Bauer broke Ramon out of prison.

192
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:22,381
你们的人会来抓他们
Your people are sending forces to bring them back.

193
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,991
他们什么时候来?
When are they coming?

194
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,041
时间?
When?

195
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,281

动手

197
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:57,301
他原本是你搭档
He was your partner.

198
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:59,091
你心情一定不好受
You must be feeling something.

199
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:05,201
我能从这笔交易里分到1千5百万美金
I've got a $15 million payday when this deal goes down.

200
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,621
因此我帮不了他
He's on his own.

201
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,591
他和你一样倔强么?

他依旧生活在谎言中
He still believes in the lie.

203
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:17,161
什么谎言?
What lie?

204
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:19,661
他认为自己的所作所为是有意义的
That what he's doing has purpose.

205
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:22,181
有信仰是好事
Belief is a beautiful thing.

206
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,341
嗨
Hello.

207
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:39,951

00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,541
Claudia?

211
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,541
Claudia?

212
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:34,481
我把手机忘里面了
I left my phone inside.

213
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:36,031
我会去取的
I'll get it.

214
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:40,081
我们走
Let's go.

215
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:08,771
- Chloe  - 怎么?

216
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:10,131
- 有Chase的消息么?  - 没有
- Have you heard from Chase?  - No.

217
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:13,081
他有没有可能 用其它频率联系你
Are there alternate frequencies he might use to contact you?

218
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:15,251
有 那些频道正在扫描中
Yeah, there are, and they're on auto-scan.

219
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:17,761
- 他没有联系  - 听我说 Chloe 我知道你很忙
- He hasn't checked in.  - Look, Chloe, I know that you're busy,

220
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:19,191
但是我们也许可以通过卫星找到他
but maybe we can reach him by satellite.

221
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:21,581
卫星? 好主意 我怎么没想到呢 Kim
Satellite? Good idea. I didn't i think of that, Kim.

222
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:24,511
- 我马上去弄  - 你没必要冷嘲热讽 Chloe
- I'll get right on that.  - Don't be sarcastic with me, Chloe.

223
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:26,561
我只是关心他们
This is someone I care about.

224
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:28,081
放轻松
Get a grip.

225

半小时内我得给总统报告
I have to update the President in half an hour.

226
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:33,261
我不想告诉他半小时内我们毫无进展 毫无头绪
I don't want to tell him we're in the same place we were a half-hour ago, which is nowhere.

227
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:36,161
我不想听借口 我只要答案 明白?
I don't want excuses. Just get me the answer, all right?

228
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:39,751
我得完成通讯文件
I need to finalize the comm file.

229
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,591
你应该已经完成了
That should have been done already.

230
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:44,621
我需要格式码 你说你会去下载的
Well, I need the format code and you said you were going to download it.

231
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:47,461
d-7-3-3-g
Delta-seven-three-three-golf.

232
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:49,561

236
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:05,451
拿到了
Yeah, I got it.

237
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:08,491

00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:18,301
如果错了结果会很严重 少了那些文件

240
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:20,221

245
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:50,801
我们也不知道 David
We don't know that, either, David.

我能询问理由么?
May I ask why?

271
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:59,491
我想面对面和你解释
That's something I'd rather explain in person.

272
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:01,551
好吧
All right.

273

we're not able to pick up Jack on any of our imagery.

275
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,711
我们失去联系有多久了?
How long we been out of contact?

276
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:24,751
从他的跟踪器失灵开始...
His tracking beacon went dead...

277
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:26,571
有27分钟了
27 minutes ago.

278
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:28,301
最后的位置?
Last known location?

279
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:29,841
这儿
Here.

280
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:32,721
他一定在这方圆30英里内
He can't be much farther out than 30 miles in any one direction.

281
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:34,001
除非他被直升机送走
Unless he was choppered out.

282
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:36,801
不可能 空军一直监视着空域
No way. Air tactical's watching the skies.

283
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:40,241
Bauer在哪儿?
Where's Bauer?

284
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:45,191
我们不知道
We don't know yet.

285
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,651
好极了
That's great.

286
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:48,601
那么
So,

287
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:51,701
这个以Jack在病毒交易现场
this entire operation, which hinges on Jack being on-site

288
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:54,381
为先决条件的行动即将功亏一篑
when they deliver the virus, is going down the tubes

289
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,461
因为我们不知道他身在何处
because we don't know where he is.

290
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:58,531
- 怎么会变得这样?  - 听着 Ryan
- How does that happen?  - Look, Ryan,

291
00:16:58,531 --> 00:16:59,821
你想要骂我们?
you want to chew us out?

292
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:02,281
晚点可以 现在我们得努力把一切搞定
Do it later. We're trying to get this back on track.

293
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:04,011
我会的
I will.

294
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:06,801
你最好找到Bauer并让一切回归正轨 Tony
You'd better find Bauer and make this thing work, Tony.

295
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:09,641
不然你们和那个不知死活Jack
Otherwise, the two of you and Jack, assuming he's still alive,

296
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:12,471
将为今天所发生的一切负责
are going to take the fall for everything that happened today,

297
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:17,321
包括监狱暴动 Salazar的越狱还有因此导致的牺牲者
from the prison riots to Salazar's escape and every dead body in between.

298
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:24,931
如果Jack去交易却得不到支援会怎么样?
So, what happens if Jack goes to this meeting without backup?

299
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:29,101
Salazar会拿到病毒
The Salazars get the virus.

300
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:32,151
之后会怎么样?
What happens from there?

301
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:35,651
我也没头绪
I don't know.

302
00:17:54,191 --> 00:17:55,601
感觉好些了么?
Feeling better?

303
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:57,971
我没事了
I'm fine.

304
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:06,891
Amador
Amador.

305
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:10,891
喂 Jack
Hello, Jack.

306
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:14,111
这几位一定是你所代表的买家
So these must be the buyers you're representing.

307
00:18:14,381 --> 00:18:16,621
这两位是Hector和Ramon Salazar
This is Hector and Ramon Salazar.

308
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:23,911
有1亿美金在日内瓦和香港的契约户口
There's $100 million in escrow accounts in Geneva and Hong Kong.

309
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:26,881
我们已经准备好随时转账
We're prepared to give immediate instructions to have the money transferred

310
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:29,921
只等病毒到位
as soon as we have confirmation that the virus has been delivered.

311
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:31,681
情况变复杂了
There's been a complication.

312
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:33,231
另一个买家也想要病毒
Another buyer's interested in the virus.

313
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:34,751
你在说什么? 我们已经谈定了
What are you talking about? We have a deal.

314
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:36,261
- 这怎么回事 Jack?  - 我不知道
- What's going on, Jack?  - I don't know.

315
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:37,931
Jack和此事无关
Jack had nothing to do with it.

316
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:41,381
这是几小时内 刚刚发生的情况
This is a new development. This just surfaced in the last few hours.

317
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:44,511
我们决定进行拍卖 病毒会给买价最高的一方
We'll hold an auction and the virus will go to the highest bidder.

318
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:45,691
Hector!

319
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:45,691
Hector!

320
00:18:47,421 --> 00:18:49,191
Salazar先生
Mr. Salazar,

321
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:52,091
我只是传达我客户的意愿
I merely represent the wishes of my client.

322
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:54,571
能让我们私下商量么?
May we have a moment?

323
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:56,401
当然
Of course.

324
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,371
Hector 这不成问题
Hector, this does not need to be a problem.

325
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:05,071
- 很成问题  - 好好想想
- It's a huge problem.  - Think it through.

326
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:07,241
你再扔个四五千万进去
You have $40 to $50 million at this price tag,

327
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:10,251
依旧能坐收8亿的利润
and you're still looking at over an $800 million profit.

328
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:12,161
你说过这个病毒能卖到10亿美金
so you said you can move the virus for a billion dollars.

329
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:13,701
你是这么估计的不是么?
That was your estimate, right?

330
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:15,411
- 差不多  - 已经到这地步了
- Something like that.  - You've come this far.

331
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:16,771
别收手
Don't stop.

332
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:18,801
干到底
Let it play out.

333
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:20,731
另一个买家已经到了
The other buyer's here.

334
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:40,711
你认识她?
You know her?

335
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:51,611
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell is he doing here?

336
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:53,741
这人是联邦特工
That man is a federal agent.

337
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:55,261
我们知道这个 Nina
We know who he is, Nina.

338
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,941
- 这没关系  - 不 有关系
- Everything's fine.  - No, it's not.

339
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:59,231
他在套我们 我们得干掉他
He's setting us up. You have to kill him.

340
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,671
杀了他!
Kill him!

341
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:04,321
谁先开枪谁就出局 我说到做到
The first man who fires gets cut down. That's a promise.

342
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,591
他怎么会在这儿?
Why is he here?

343
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:14,851
他和你一样 Nina 是买方代表
He represents a buyer, Nina, just like you.

344
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:16,391
不 他不是
No, he doesn't.

345
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,711
相信我 我了解他 无论他说了什么
Believe me, I know him. Whatever he's told you,

346
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:20,291
都是骗你的
he's lying.

347
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,971
我已经不为反恐局干了 Nina
I don't work for CTU anymore, Nina.

348
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,381
我给自己干
I work for myself.

349
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:32,291
- 我走了  - Nina 拜托了
- I'm out of here.  - Nina, please.

350
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,701
让她走 我们继续原来的约定
Let her go and honor the original agreement.

351
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:35,971
Nina!

352
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:35,971
Nina!

353
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:38,481
你的客户知道你这样离开
I don't think your client's going to be too happy if you walk out

354
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:41,381
让病毒落入他手后 不会高兴的
and let the virus go to another buyer.

355
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:47,081
我们得拿下这笔交易
We gotta close this deal.

356
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,821
我们到处都有人放风
We have a wide perimeter, lookouts everywhere,

357
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:53,551
而且也监听着每条频道
and we're monitoring every frequency.

358
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,471
25公里内没有任何执法机关和军队
There's no law or military within 25 kilometers.

359
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:01,731
你知道我的作风
You know how I work.

360
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:04,121
这里很安全
This area is completely secure.

361
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:07,101
如果我起疑心 那我根本不会来
If I had the slightest doubt, I wouldn't be here.

362
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:13,221
我建议大家都冷静一会
I suggest we all take a few minutes to calm ourselves.

363
00:21:14,031 --> 00:21:16,221
然后我就开始解释规矩
Then I'll explain the ground rules,

364
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:18,131
让我们开始投标
and we'll proceed with the bids.

365
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:20,401
同意么?
Agreed?

366
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:24,461
行
Agreed.

367
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,341
好吧
Fine.

368
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:29,881
很好
Good.

369
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,133
David.
David

370
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:31,853
Alan 很高兴见到你
Alan, it's good to see you.

371
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,983
谢谢你百忙之中抽空看我
Thanks for finding the time to fit me in.

372
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:36,023
你总是为我安排时间 Alan
You've always made time for me, Alan,

373
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:38,653
即使没有要事
even when there was no obvious reason to do so.

374
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:41,383
你是很有潜力的 David.
Your potential was always obvious, David.

375
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:43,293
你怎么样?
How are you doing?

376
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:45,533
我身体有些部分不灵光了
Well, I could use a few new body parts,

377
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:48,343
- 但除此以外  - 你看起来不错
- but besides that...  - Well, you look well.

378
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:56,123
我知道你很好奇找你有什么要事
I know you're wondering what could be so important that I'd ask you here,

379
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:59,043
我直截了当地说吧
so I'll be brief and I'll be blunt.

380
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:01,283
我要你兄弟退出政权
I want your brother off the team.

381
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,653
我不明白 你一直很支持Wayne
I don't understand. You've always been supportive of Wayne.

382
00:23:05,663 --> 00:23:07,013
曾经是
I was.

383
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:08,843
但现在不是
I'm not anymore.

384
00:23:09,813 --> 00:23:11,953
这是为什么 Alan?
What's this all about, Alan?

385
00:23:15,663 --> 00:23:18,103
- 老爷?  - 让我妻子过来
- Yes, sir?  - Tell my wife to come in here.

386
00:23:18,103 --> 00:23:19,523
马上
Right away, sir.

387
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:32,523
Julia.
Julia

388
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:34,053
总统先生
Mr. President.

389
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:37,353
David想知道为什么我要他解雇Wayne
David is wondering why I want him to fire Wayne,

390
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:40,413
我觉得你能告诉他
and I thought you should explain.

391
00:23:45,653 --> 00:23:48,613
如你所知 我和Wayne相识有一会儿了
As you know, I've known Wayne for some time.

392
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:51,503
三年前
Three years ago,

393
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,793
当他是Alan公司总裁时
when he was President of Alan's company,

394
00:23:53,803 --> 00:23:56,303
我们经常呆在一起
we began to spend quite a bit of time together.

395
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,503
说到点上 Julia
Get to it, Julia.

396
00:24:02,163 --> 00:24:03,713
Wayne和我坠入爱河
Wayne and I became involved.

397
00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:05,553
他们发生了关系!
They had an affair,

398
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:08,203
当时我还在康复
while I was recuperating from the stroke.

399
00:24:08,203 --> 00:24:10,733
你兄弟就这么报答我
That's how your brother thanked me.

400
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:16,673
继续
Go on.

401
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:19,623
在你要求他加入你政权前
We saw each other for a year,

402
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,903
我和他交往了一年
before you asked him to join your administration.

403
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:25,473
然后我们就分手了
Then we broke it off.

404
00:24:25,783 --> 00:24:27,193
等等
Hold on.

405
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:31,473
如果你知道这事 为什么当时你不表态?
If you knew about this, why didn't you say something?

406
00:24:31,473 --> 00:24:32,893
我不知道
I didn't.

407
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:34,913
是最近刚发现的
I just found out recently.

408
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,933
你知道么 David?
Did you know, David?

409
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:41,193
- 你也瞒着我么?  - 当然没有
- Did you keep it from me, too?  - Of course not.

410
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:43,303
我甚至无法相信这是真的
I can hardly even believe it's true.

411
00:24:43,303 --> 00:24:44,763
是真的
It's true.

412
00:24:50,303 --> 00:24:52,933
- 我告诉过你 我有多抱歉  - 你出去
- I've told you how sorry I am.  - You can go.

413
00:24:55,343 --> 00:24:59,883
我一直等你来洛杉矶 这样我能亲自找你
I waited for you to come to Los Angeles so I could do this face-to-face.

414
00:25:01,423 --> 00:25:03,483
我把公司交给你兄弟
I gave your brother my company,

415
00:25:03,483 --> 00:25:05,313
而他拐走了我妻子
and he took my wife.

416
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:07,943
现在我要夺走他的工作
Now I'm taking away his job.

417
00:25:09,743 --> 00:25:11,663
Wayne是我的总管
Wayne is my chief of staff,

418
00:25:11,663 --> 00:25:13,373
我最好的朋友
my closest friend.

419
00:25:13,373 --> 00:25:15,133
- 我信任他  - 我不信任
- I trust him.  - I don't,

420
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:17,573
你也不应该 他不正直
and neither should you. He's dishonest.

421
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:22,633
我以为你会赞同我 David
I think you would agree, David,

422
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:27,163
这些年 没有我的支持你走不到这一步
that you wouldn't be where you are without my support over the years.

423
00:25:28,183 --> 00:25:31,323
我从来不求回报
I've never asked you for anything in return,

424
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,363
除了现在 我要求
but I'm asking you now.

425
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:35,683
解雇Wayne
Fire Wayne.

426
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:40,683
我很抱歉 Alan 我做不到
I'm sorry, Alan, I can't do that.

427
00:25:45,993 --> 00:25:48,443
我很失望...
I'm disappointed...

428
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,923
... 但并不惊讶
... but not surprised.

429
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:55,713
你也了解我 知道这样做会有什么结果
And you know me well enough not to be surprised if there are repercussions.

430
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:58,113
我希望你这不是在威胁我
I hope you're not threatening me.

431
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,183
我从不威胁人 David
I don't make threats, David.

432
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,143
我说到做到
I just tell it like it is.

433
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:05,903
如果你改变了主意 记得联系我
You let me know if you change your mind.

434
00:26:18,263 --> 00:26:20,813
让他们调查这些位置
Have them open up the field search to these coordinates...

435
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,383
告诉他们这优先处理
tell them it's a priority.

436
00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:23,983
- 你要我找...  - 抱歉 我并不想打岔
- Do you want me to ask...  - Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt,

437
00:26:23,993 --> 00:26:26,133
能和你私下谈谈么?
but can I see you for a minute?

438
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:27,723
你这些活够么?
Do you have enough to go on?

439
00:26:27,723 --> 00:26:30,753
如果联系卫星处有问题 我会找你
I'll let you know if the satellite guys give me any trouble.

440
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:34,113
怎么了?
What is it?

441
00:26:34,113 --> 00:26:35,813
是Tony的事
It's actually about Tony.

442
00:26:36,973 --> 00:26:38,333
听我说...
Look...

443
00:26:39,803 --> 00:26:41,833
我不知道...
I don't know if he's...

444
00:26:42,863 --> 00:26:44,123
你不知道...
You don't know if he...

445
00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:45,583
什么?
what?

446
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:48,453
我不知道他到底干得了干不了
I don't know if he's well enough to do his job.

447
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:50,383
Kim 几小时前他刚中弹
Kim, he was shot a few hours ago.

448
00:26:50,383 --> 00:26:52,793
他没法全力工作
He's not going to be working at full capacity.

449
00:26:52,793 --> 00:26:55,193
我知道 但是如果他总是漏掉关键怎么办?
I know, but what if he misses something important?

450
00:26:55,343 --> 00:26:56,823
我指如果他搞砸了事
I mean, he's running things.

451
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,323
出了什么事?
What happened?

452
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:01,113
他让我完成通讯文件
He asked me to finalize the comm files,

453
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:03,843
但是他忘记给我格式码
but he forgot to give me the format codes.

454
00:27:03,973 --> 00:27:05,573
至前他还骂我一顿
And then just before, he chewed me out

455
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:07,983
骂我不记得他说的事
for forgetting something he thought he told me...

456
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:10,333
但他确实没有说过
except he never told me.

457
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:12,983
他压力很大 我们也是
He's under a lot of stress... we all are.

458
00:27:12,993 --> 00:27:14,783
我就是说这个
That's my point.

459
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:17,243
Michelle 你是他老婆
Michelle, you're his wife,

460
00:27:17,243 --> 00:27:19,193
你也是这里的二把手
but you're also second in command,

461
00:27:19,203 --> 00:27:20,773
如果Tony干不下去
and if Tony can't do the job,

462
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:24,313
得有人转告Chappelle 而此人非你莫属
somebody has to tell Chappelle, and I think that someone should be you.

463
00:27:41,003 --> 00:27:42,873
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

464
00:27:43,223 --> 00:27:45,073
休息一会
Taking a rest.

465
00:27:45,993 --> 00:27:48,643
Hector的卡车下面漏油了
There's oil under Hector's truck.

466
00:27:48,743 --> 00:27:51,243
得在他回来至前修好
It needs to be fixed before Hector gets back.

467
00:27:52,193 --> 00:27:53,473
快!
Now!

468
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:58,293
好吧 我会去修的
Okay, I'll check it out.

469
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:28,343
我有Jack的消息
Here, I have a message from Jack.

470
00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:29,943
你能听见么?
Can you hear me?

471
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:31,983
情况和你所见不同
Things aren't what they seem.

472
00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:34,303
Jack并不是Ramon和Hector一伙的
Jack isn't really with Ramon and Hector.

473
00:28:34,303 --> 00:28:37,753
他所做的一切是为了争取他们的信任
Everything he's done has been to earn their trust.

474
00:28:37,753 --> 00:28:41,303
Jack想夺走他们要买的病毒
The virus that they're going to buy, Jack is going to take it from them.

475
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,383
你明白么?
Do you understand?

476
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:46,673
你们国家的士兵离这儿不远
There are soldiers from your country not far from here.

477
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:48,853
只要Jack一给信号他们就来
They'll come when Jack calls for them.

478
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:50,813
Claudia?

479
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:50,813
Claudia?

480
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:54,613
Jack保证如果我帮你 就带着我全家离开
Jack promised to get me and my family out of here if I help you.

481
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:56,003
那就帮我
Then help me.

482
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:59,113
现在不行 周围人太多了
I can't now... there are too many men around.

483
00:28:59,253 --> 00:29:01,003
但挺住
But don't give up.

484
00:29:01,003 --> 00:29:02,753
我会想办法的
I'll figure out a way,

485
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:04,303
好么?
all right?

486
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:14,583
各组都会写下决定的最终要价
Each party will make one final bid in writing.

487
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:17,273
10分钟内 我们就得开始
I want all this to start in the next ten minutes.

488
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:19,783
你们得开个价
You have to come up with a number.

489
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:21,683
我们给了1个亿
We are offering a hundred.

490
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:24,083
她出价一定高很多
She must've made it enough to make this worthwhile.

491
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:26,123
大概比我们高5千万
Say, another 50.

492
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:29,253
- 那么我们给1亿7千5百万?  - 不够
- So we go 175?  - More.

493
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:30,993
如果我们要干 就得狠下心
If we do this, we do it to win.

494
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,813
至少2个亿
At least 200.

495
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,723
去联系吧
Make the calls.

496
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:46,633
她是谁?
Who is she?

497
00:29:48,813 --> 00:29:51,103
我说过了 她以前在反恐局是我的搭档
I told you, she was my partner at CTU.

498
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,433
不对
No.

499
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:54,433
你们之间的关系不只如此
There's more between you and this woman.

500
00:29:58,113 --> 00:30:00,363
她杀了我妻子
She killed my wife.

501
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:09,443
这会影响你么 Jack?
Is this going to be a problem, Jack?

502
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:13,073
不
No.

503
00:30:13,513 --> 00:30:15,273
不会
No problem.

504
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:34,942
- 我们去哪儿?  - 我们一起走
- Where are we going?  - We'll be together.

505
00:30:34,982 --> 00:30:36,082
我们现在也在一起
We're together now.

506
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:37,112
Hector会和我们一起来么?
Is Hector coming with us?

507
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:39,062
Sergio 只管做准备离开
Sergio, just be ready to leave.

508
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:41,302
- 但是Hector呢?  - Sergi 忘掉他!
- But what about Hector?  - Sergio, forget about Hector!

509
00:30:41,302 --> 00:30:43,742
只管按我说的做!
Just do what I'm telling you!

510
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:07,892
你要做什么?
What are you about to do?

511
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:11,882
Jack说如果我救他搭档 他就帮我们离开 爸爸
Jack said if I help his partner, he'll get us out of here, papa.

512
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:13,192
这些人...
These people...

513
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:16,152
Ramon Hector和Jack Bauer... 谁都不能信!
Ramon, Hector, Jack Bauer... you can't trust any of them!

514
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:19,002
Jack跟Ramon Hector他们不一样
Jack's not like Ramon and Hector.

515
00:31:19,432 --> 00:31:23,122
爸爸 拜托了 这是我们脱离这里的机会
Papa, please, this is our chance to get out of here.

516
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:27,802
那就去吧
Then go.

517
00:31:28,572 --> 00:31:30,512
不
No.

518
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,552
我们一起走
No, we're all going.

519
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,712
我不会丢下你的
No, I'm not going without you.

520
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,982
那么地面卫星a39呢?
What about Landsat alpha three-nine?

521
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:57,362
对 没错
Yeah, that's about it, right.

522
00:31:58,312 --> 00:31:59,722
谢谢
Thanks.

523
00:32:02,272 --> 00:32:03,722
我刚查了国安局的纪录
I just checked all the NSA logs.

524
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:06,242
没有任何卫星行经Jack可能所在的区域
There're no satellites going through the area we think Jack's in.

525
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:08,542
保险起见 我会检查航线
I'll check the flight paths just in case.

526
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,712
保险什么? 我刚查过
Just in case what? I just checked it.

527
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:17,382
这不是今天第一个问题了 Tony
There've been other mistakes today, Tony.

528

问题
Mistakes.

529
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:22,472
你认为是我造成的?
You think I made them?

530
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:25,212
亲爱的 你应该继续留在医院
Sweetheart, you should still be in the hospital.

531
00:32:25,662 --> 00:32:27,482
如果你不是状态不是百分百好 应该退居二线
If you're not a hundred percent, you should step down.

532
00:32:27,652 --> 00:32:28,482
我没事
I'm fine.

533
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:29,212
你今天遇上的一切
And after what you've been through today,

534
00:32:29,312 --> 00:32:31,182
- 让我不觉得...  - 我说我没事
- I don't see how you...  - I just said I'm fine, all right.

535
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,522
到此为止
End of discussion, please.

536
00:32:34,642 --> 00:32:36,112
Tony 我找到了这个
Tony, I've got something.

537
00:32:36,112 --> 00:32:38,402
国安局有颗卫星能够让我们重新定位
NSA's got a satellite we may be able to reposition.

538
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:40,362
我们只需要许可
We just have to ask for access.

539
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:44,092
- 好的 谢谢  - 没事
- All right, thanks.  - Yeah.

540
00:33:08,892 --> 00:33:10,262
怎么?
Yes?

541
00:33:10,812 --> 00:33:12,672
我要和你谈谈 Ryan
I need to talk to you, Ryan.

542
00:33:12,772 --> 00:33:14,102
等下
Hold on.

543
00:33:17,192 --> 00:33:19,192
我觉得Tony现在不应该呆在这儿
I don't think Tony should be here right now.

544
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:21,432
据我所知 他并没有受任何重伤
My understanding is, he's not in any imminent danger.

545
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,142
不 不是指这个
No, it's not that.

546
00:33:23,442 --> 00:33:26,002
我收到报告 他一直健忘
I've had reports he's been forgetful,

547
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:27,592
漏掉信息
missing things.

548
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:29,872
- 比方说?  - 关键信息
- Like what?  - Key information.

549
00:33:29,872 --> 00:33:32,572
格式码 某些会造成拖延的事情
Format codes. Things that are causing delays.

550
00:33:34,132 --> 00:33:37,062
平日里我不会担心这个 但是...
On any other day, I wouldn't be worried about this, but...

551
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:40,732
我不知道他今天到底行不行
I'm just not sure if he's up to it today.

552
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,542
如果我现在把他停职 我们的进度也会慢
If I pull him now, that sets us back, too.

553
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,282
没人能替代他
No one can replace what he does.

554
00:33:45,282 --> 00:33:48,542
他 Gael还有Jack是此次计划的始作俑者
He, Gael and Jack have been working this from the beginning.

555
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:50,542
除非你认为他犯的错误很严重...
Unless you think his mistakes are significant enough...

556
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,062
对
I do.

557
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:55,162
不然我不会来找你
Or else I wouldn't be bringing this to you.

558
00:33:59,402 --> 00:34:00,622
好吧
All right.

559
00:34:01,032 --> 00:34:03,712
让我处理完这个电话 就着手解决
Just let me wrap up this call and I'll get into it.

560
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,322
谢谢
Thank you.

561
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:14,722
我明白 但是你得办到
I understand that, but you need to make it happen.

562
00:34:17,692 --> 00:34:19,692
我刚从Alan那边回来
I just got back from seeing Alan.

563
00:34:19,842 --> 00:34:21,312
他有什么事?
What did he want?

564
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,782
我想你心里明白
Oh, I think you know.

565
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:24,142
明白什么 David?
Know what, David?

566
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:26,902
他要我解雇你!
He wants me to fire you!

567
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:29,002
你到底在想什么
What the hell were you thinking,

568
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:31,622
和有夫之妇发生关系?!
carrying on an affair with a married woman?!

569
00:34:31,622 --> 00:34:33,452
她老公还是我最大的支持者!
The wife of my biggest supporter!

570
00:34:33,452 --> 00:34:35,452
听着 我很抱歉
Listen, I am sorry.

571
00:34:35,562 --> 00:34:37,172
但是这个错误 我已经更正了
But it was a mistake, and I corrected it.

572
00:34:37,172 --> 00:34:39,322
Alan不这么想
Not in Alan's mind.

573
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:41,472
对他来说 这是刚发生的
For him, this is fresh.

574
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:44,052
他刚刚得知
He just found out,

575
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:46,732
而且他要你付出代价
and he wants to make you pay.

576
00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:52,002
听着 我们都知道你不能和Alan作对
Look, we both know you can't afford to make an enemy out of Alan.

577
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:53,752
他权势太大
He wields too much power.

578
00:34:53,752 --> 00:34:55,102
所以...
So...

579
00:34:55,532 --> 00:34:56,652
我会辞职
I'll resign.

580
00:34:56,652 --> 00:35:01,222
你的去留 是由我决定而不是Alan Milliken
You'll leave only I decide it's the right thing to do, not Alan Milliken.

581
00:35:01,302 --> 00:35:05,622
David 相信我 Alan是个心狠手辣的人
David, Alan is a very dirty fighter, trust me.

582
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:08,552
你真的要和他作对?
Are you sure you want to get down in the gutter with that man?

583
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:10,662
你逼得我别无选择 不是么?
Well, you haven't left me much choice, have you?

584
00:35:38,152 --> 00:35:39,342
你找我 Ryan?
You wanted to see me, Ryan?

585
00:35:39,342 --> 00:35:40,772
对
Yeah.

586
00:35:43,262 --> 00:35:44,442
怎么了?
What's going on?

587
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,132
我找你 因为有人质疑你的能力
I asked you here because your competency has been brought into question.

588
00:35:49,342 --> 00:35:50,902
谁?
By whom?

589
00:35:52,932 --> 00:35:54,732
我
By me.

590
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:56,922
一位职员告诉我...
An employee came to me with some concerns, and I...

591
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:59,812
- 一位职员?  - Kim Bauer
- An employee?  - Kim Bauer.

592
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:01,722
而我觉得有必要说明你的状况
And I felt I needed to address them.

593
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:03,452
和Ryan?
With Ryan?

594
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:04,892
你不先来找我?
You didn't come to me first?

595
00:36:04,892 --> 00:36:06,982
- 我找过你了 Tony 你不肯...  - 够了
- tried to talk to you, Tony, you wouldn't...  - Enough.

596
00:36:06,982 --> 00:36:09,172
事实上 Ryan 他们错了
The point is, Ryan, is that they're wrong.

597
00:36:09,172 --> 00:36:11,502
我完全胜任我的工作
I am fit for duty completely.

598
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:15,272
好吧 你进来的时候
Alright, when you entered the room,

599
00:36:15,272 --> 00:36:17,192
显示器是开着的
the monitor was on.

600
00:36:17,812 --> 00:36:19,452
告诉我 上面有些什么
Tell me what it showed.

601
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:30,852
左半边是美国的电脑合成图像
On the left side was a c-tan schematic of the country,

602
00:36:30,852 --> 00:36:33,552
标明在佛罗里达 纽约和蒙大拿
indicating an ongoing investigation in Florida,

603
00:36:33,552 --> 00:36:35,762
进行的调查
New York and Montana.

604
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:39,922
右半边是Austin银行的报告
On the right side was an all clear report from the Austin branch.

605
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:42,172
没错
That's correct.

606
00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:45,932
但是这并不能解释你所犯的纰漏
But it still doesn't ease my mind considering the slips you made.

607
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:47,472
什么纰漏?
What slips?

608
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:48,872
Michelle?

609
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:48,872
Michelle?

610
00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:53,082
你认为你把频率扫描的识别给了Kim
You thought you gave Kim the signature on the frequency scans.

611
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:54,712
但你没给
You didn't.

612
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,562
并没有口头给
Not verbally, no.

613
00:36:56,742 --> 00:37:00,212
我和她谈话15分钟之前 我发到了她的屏幕上
I put them on her "inscreen" 15 minutes before I talked to her.

614
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:02,002
还有什么?
Anything else?

615
00:37:03,442 --> 00:37:06,682
他说你没有及时地把格式码发到她的表格里
She said you didn't load the format codes onto the grid in time.

616
00:37:06,802 --> 00:37:10,582
不 我并没有给她发过去
No. I didn't load the format codes onto her grid.

617
00:37:10,732 --> 00:37:13,492
我把格式码及时地发到了共享硬盘里
I put them in the shared volume on time.

618
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:15,302
自己查
Check it.

619
00:37:28,722 --> 00:37:31,832
在那儿
It's there.

620
00:37:33,602 --> 00:37:36,182
好吧 很抱歉 Tony
All right, I'm sorry, Tony.

621
00:37:36,312 --> 00:37:37,942
我们谈完了
We're done here.

622
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:40,042
很好
Good.

623
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:50,022
你浪费了我们重要的时间
You've wasted time we don't have.

624
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:43,853
你们想好开价了么?
Are you ready with your bids?

625
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:45,973
- 是的  - 是的
- Yes.  - Yes.

626
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:50,723
让我们看看
Let me see them.

627
00:39:06,703 --> 00:39:10,093
银行会确认这些资金?
And the banks will verify the presence of these funds?

628
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:12,933
没错
Yes, that is correct.

629
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,563
银行也会确认这些资金的
The bank will verify those as well.

630
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:33,113
你们开价2亿2千5百万
Your bid is $225 million.

631
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:36,623
她的是2亿4千万
Hers is 240.

632
00:39:37,593 --> 00:39:39,523
Nina,
Nina

633
00:39:39,523 --> 00:39:41,453
你赢了
you win.

634
00:39:43,323 --> 00:39:45,023
你死定了
You are a dead man.

635
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:48,203
我的人会带你们出去
My people will escort you out.

636
00:39:52,173 --> 00:39:55,873
2小时内交易
The transfer will take place in two hours.

637
00:39:59,683 --> 00:40:02,153
你说会把病毒带来 你失败了!
You said you were going to deliver the virus, you failed!

638
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:03,383
还没结束呢 Hector
Not now, Hector.

639
00:40:03,383 --> 00:40:04,673
走吧
Come on.

640
00:40:08,723 --> 00:40:10,963
我会通知你细节
I'll be contacting you with the details.

641
00:40:10,963 --> 00:40:12,703
很好
Excellent.

642
00:40:12,823 --> 00:40:15,423
- 我们会等你电话  - 走吧
- We'll be waiting for your call.  - Let's go!

643
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:42,083
你不能眼睁睁的看着Nina Myers这样离开
You can't let Nina Myers just walk away from it.

644
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:44,143
- 你得派人跟着她  - 闭嘴!
- You got to put a man on her.  - Shut up!

645
00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:45,693
Ramon 听我说
Ramon, listen to me.

646
00:40:45,803 --> 00:40:47,283
Nina现在一走
Nina gets away now,

647
00:40:47,283 --> 00:40:49,133
就会无影无踪 你永远也找不到她
she'll disappear. You'll never find her again.

648
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:51,623
你已经有过机会了 Jack
You had your chance, Jack.

649
00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:24,283
好了
All right.

650
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:26,183
这儿就行了
This is good enough.

651
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:34,313
Ramon 求你了 你这是酿成大错
Ramon, please. You're making a mistake.

652
00:41:34,313 --> 00:41:36,243
- 出去  - 我能解释 我不知道...
- Get out.  - I can explain. I didn't know...

653
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,493
出去!
Get out!

654
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,333
你对我们已经没有利用价值了
You're of no use to us anymore.

655
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:45,003
你失败了!
You failed!

656
00:41:45,113 --> 00:41:46,993
Hector 别这么做!
Hector, don't do this!

657
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:49,583
Ramon 好好想想
Ramon, think this through.

658
00:41:49,993 --> 00:41:53,423
那些你承诺过会提供病毒的买家怎么办?
What about all your buyers around the world that you promised the virus to?

659
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:55,103
他们会发现你们被放了鸽子
They're going to know you were double-crossed

660
00:41:55,103 --> 00:41:56,873
却束手无策
and that you did nothing about it.

661
00:41:56,873 --> 00:41:58,643
你怎么和他们解释?
What are you going to say to them?

662
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:01,453
"对不起 我们下次会搞定的?"
"I'm sorry, we'll try and get it right next time?"

663
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:04,163
Salazar会被世人耻笑
The Salazar name will be a joke.

664
00:42:04,163 --> 00:42:05,273
想想吧!
Come on!

665
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:08,553
5小时前 你还被关在美国监狱
Five hours ago, you were in an American prison,

666
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:11,293
你之所以能自由是因为我把你救了出来!
and now you're free because I broke you out!

667
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:14,133
而且我带给了你一笔千载难逢的生意
And then I brought you the deal of a lifetime.

668
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:17,183
你到底还要我怎么样才能证明我和你是一伙的?
What do I have to do to prove to you I'm on your side?

669
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:25,489
这桩生意还有机会
This deal can still happen.

670
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:27,999
- 我们还能弄到病毒  - 怎么弄?
- We can get the virus.  - How do you get the virus?

671
00:42:27,999 --> 00:42:29,499
我告诉过你
I told you...

672
00:42:29,499 --> 00:42:32,059
- 那个女的 Nina  - 是那女的带来的问题
- the woman, Nina.  - The woman? She's the problem.

673
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:34,439
- 她开价比我们高  - 我认识她
- She outbid us.  - I know her.

674
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:36,029
是我训练她的
I trained her. I can get to her.

675
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:37,539
你甚至不知道哪里能找到她!
You don't even know how to find her!

676
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:38,949
我会找到的!
I'll find her!

677
00:42:39,049 --> 00:42:41,619
求你了 Ramon 你不能半途而废
Please, Ramon, you can't lose here.

678
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:44,179
如果我失败了 你要杀我 可以
If I fail, you get to kill me, fine.

679
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:46,569
但是如果我成功了 那么这宗生意就能继续
But if I succeed, the deal will go forward,

680
00:42:46,594 --> 00:42:48,984
一切会步入正轨 我们都能分到钱
we'll be back on track. We'll all get paid.

681
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:53,849
求你了
Please.

682
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:00,559
Hector.
Hector

683
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,299
让我们再看看情况吧
Let's play this out a little longer.

684
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,409
这个家伙命够大
The man has more lives than a cat.
