00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,835
不管怎么搞的 事情已经发生了
It doesn't matter how it happened,it happened.

284
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:24,935
我们已经确认他劫持了一辆淡蓝色的雪弗兰Malibu
We identified the vehicle he carjacked as a light blue Malibu.

285
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:27,645
我们设立了路障 调用了交通监控摄像和卫星监控系统
We set up a roadblock and uplinked traffic cams and satellite sweeps.

286
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:32,645
但我需要Tony来协助行动中的数据交换
But I need Tony to coordinate the data flow with tactical.

287
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,735
这没什么可担心的 Brad
There's no downside here,Brad.

288
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:38,745
你知道他是不会逃跑的 而且他的参与对行动有很大帮助
You know he's not a flight risk and he'd be a major asset to the operation.

289
00:18:38,745 --> 00:18:41,565
我把Tony放出去可能会被指控的
I could be brought up on charges if I let Tony out.

290
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:42,885
我们不能跟丢Rabens
We can't lose Rabens.

291
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:51,745
除非你愿意亲自指挥调度...
So unless you want to take responsibility and run tactical yourself...

292
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:58,545
你这是在浪费时间 Brad
You are wasting time,Brad

293
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:08,245
跟我去指挥中心
We need you on the floor.

294
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,545
快点 Chloe Rabens在哪?
Come on,Chloe,where's Rabens?

295
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:18,835
再等一会 Jack
Just a second,Jack.

296
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:20,135
我想我找到了
I think I have got a match.

297
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:23,435
一辆淡绿色的雪弗兰Malibu 在第五大道Vanowen区
A light green Malibu,intersection of Fifth and Vanowen.

298
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:24,745
好的 我们离那不远
Ok,we are only a few blocks away,

299
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:26,045
我们马上赶过去
we are gonna head over there now.

300
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:27,945
Adam 给我一个牌照的放大图片
Adam,get me a closer shot of that plate.

301
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:30,635
马上就好
Doing it now.

302
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:34,145
我回来了 Jack Michelle都跟我说了
I am back in play,Jack,Michelle got me up to speed.

303
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:36,245
Tony 还要多久能得到牌照号?
Tony,how long till the plate's I.D?

304
00:19:36,245 --> 00:19:39,045
Adam 确认是那辆吗?
Adam,do we have a match?

305
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,695
是的 是他 完全吻合
Yes,it's him. It's pretty match.

306
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:42,335
Jack 是他
Jack,it's him.

307
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:43,635
他正朝哪个方向行驶?
Which direction is he headed?

308
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:45,445
往东面的Del Mar去了 刚过了Franklin大街
East on Del Mar,just past Franklin.

309
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:47,135
就是这区了
It's this block.

310
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:52,145
就是那辆
Right there,right there.

311
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:56,545
Tony 发现他了 他正在Manning大街向南开往Chatham中心
Tony,we got him. He's headed south on Manning toward the Chatham Center.

312
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:57,645
请求支援
We are going to need backup.

313
00:19:57,645 --> 00:20:02,645
收到
Copy that.

314
00:20:25,745 --> 00:20:27,905
Tony 支援会从哪边过来?
Tony,where's that backup coming in from?

315
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:30,775
他们会从东面和南边包抄他
From the east and from the south on a reciprocal course.

316
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:34,015
那就没错了 我们正在De Soto大街向西行驶
Ok,we just made a right. We are headed west on De Soto.

317
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:42,475
快把那车挪开
Get that thing out of here now.

318
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:57,715
Tony 我们跟丢了
Tony,we have been cut off.

319
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,275
他向北往Lawndale去了
He made a right on to Lawndale. He's headed north.

320
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:02,111
我们和他相距大约三个街区
We are about 3 blocks behind him.

321
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:06,335
是的 Jack 我们在这个区域有三辆车堵截他 就在拐弯处
Yeah,Jack,we have 3 vehicles in the area ready to cut him off. At the corner.

322
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:15,171
Jack 我们在Palm街西北的Chamberlain截住他了
Jack,we got him pinned on Chamberlain,just north of Palm.

323
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:17,235
堵住他 我还差两个街区就到了
Keep him there. We are 2 blocks away.

324
00:21:35,815 --> 00:21:39,271
他逃进了Chamberlain的一所中学 从大门进去的
He's running into the middle school on Chamberlain,main entrance.

325
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:41,815
Tony 我们马上就到这所中学了
Tony,we are coming up on the middle school now.

326
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,411
Tony 他进了学校 一会儿和你联系
Tony,he's in the school. Gotta get back to you.

327
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,391
告诉后面赶来的人守住各个出入口
Tell the arriving teams to secure the exits.

328
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:55,851
我们不能疏散学校里的人
We can't evacuate this school.

329
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,115
否则他就有机会跑掉 我们行动
We run the risk of losing him. Let's move.

330
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:07,985
Hayes 守住西面的门
Hayes,cover the west exit.

331
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:23,721
- 有发现吗?  - 没有
- You got anything?  - Nothing.

332
00:22:23,745 --> 00:22:25,711
守好这个门 谁也不许离开
Cover your exit. No one leaves this building.

333
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:28,175
Chase 带你的人去搜查礼堂
Chase,take your men and search the auditorium.

334
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:55,702
所有师生请留在你们的教室里并锁上门
All teachers and students are instructed to remain in their classrooms and lock their doors.

335
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,160
我重复 留在教室里并锁上门
I repeat: remain in the classrooms and lock the doors.

336
00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:16,704
没事的 孩子们
It's all right,children.

337
00:24:14,146 --> 00:24:17,146
Chase 我是Jack 二楼安全 收到了吗?
Chase,it's Jack. Second floor is clear. Do you copy?

338
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:19,956
Chase?

339
00:25:47,316 --> 00:25:50,456
不 Chase 不要动 不会有事的
No,Chase,just lay still. Everything's going to be all right.

340
00:25:55,926 --> 00:25:59,606
这是我阻止他携带病毒逃跑的唯一办法
This is the only thing I could do to keep him from escaping with the virus.

341
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:05,236
别浪费时间了 拿不下来的
Don't waste your time,it's not coming off.

342
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:06,646
你说什么?
What are you talking about?

343
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:08,946
Rabens根本没有打算把它拿下来
Rabens didn't even try to remove it.

344
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:11,086
如果能打开的话 他早就开了
If he could unlock it,he would have.

345
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:14,326
Tony Rabens死了
Tony,Rabens is dead.

346
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:16,506
病毒在我们手里
The virus is in our possession.

347
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:19,606
但这个装置的释放程序已经启动
But the dispersal device has been activated.

348
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,222
好的 Jack 我需要你找到一个安全的容器
All right,Jack,I need you to find a secure container.

349
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:24,306
任何密封的装置
Anything airtight.

350
00:26:27,506 --> 00:26:27,896
什么?
What?

351
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:28,666
稍后再解释给你听
I will explain later.

352
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,066
现在我需要联系上
Right now I need you to put me in touch with one of the teams.

353
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:33,396
拆除过这种装置的小队之一
that's been able to disarm the device already.

354
00:26:33,646 --> 00:26:34,682
好 马上打给你
All right,I will get back to you.

355
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:35,706
要快
Hurry.

356
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:38,816
小心那个装置
Just support the device.

357
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:45,752
Jack 我不知道最后会变成什么样
Jack,I don't know how this is all going to turn out,

358
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:46,812
但我想让你替我和Kim说声抱歉
but I want you to tell Kim that I am sorry.

359
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:49,102
你来告诉Kim 你亲口和她去说
You got to tell Kim,you tell her yourself.

360
00:26:49,126 --> 00:26:50,266
我们会没事的
We're going to get through this.

361
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:52,826
坚持住 会没事的
You just stay with me. We are going to get through this.

362
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:00,316
- Jack 我帮你接通了  - 好
- Jack,I am patching you through.  - OK.

363
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:02,602
我是Roger Summers
Roger Summers here.

364
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:05,912
Roger 我的搭档把病毒释放装置扣在了自己手腕上
Roger,my partner had to fasten the dispersal device to his wrist.

365
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:07,282
以阻止罪犯携带它潜逃
to stop the courier from escaping with it.

366
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:10,852
我需要知道如何停止它的定时装置或是卸下它的扣锁装置
I need to figure out how to disarm the timer or remove the clamp.

367
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,366
不可能的 它的扣锁装置是钛合金制造的
Forget about the clamp. It's titanium,

368
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:14,562
同时里面还有防损坏装置
and it's also wired into the tamper proof mechanism.

369
00:27:14,586 --> 00:27:16,552
那好 那我们来停止定时装置 我该怎么做?
Fine,then let's disarm the timer. What do I do?

370
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:18,932
在扣锁装置反面有个金属板
There's a plate at the opposite end of the clamp.

371
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:19,836
你把它打开
You need to open that up.

372
00:27:19,966 --> 00:27:21,466
好 我看到了
Ok,I see it.

373
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:25,796
Chase 坚持住 坚持住
Chase,stay with me. Stay with me.

374
00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:34,856
好 我看到定时装置了 3分51秒 正在倒计时
Ok,I have got the timer. 3 minutes,51 seconds,counting down.

375
00:27:47,156 --> 00:27:47,726
好了
Ok,done.

376
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,376
好 最左端的线应该是红色的
Ok,the furthest to the left should be red.

377
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,836
小心剪断它 不要碰到其他线路
Cut it without making contact with the others.

378
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:09,146
你准备好了吗?
You ready?

379
00:28:16,386 --> 00:28:18,832
我剪断了 但是计时器仍在倒计时
I cut the red wire,but the timer is still counting down.

380
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:21,376
没事的 再剪一条它就会停下的
That's ok. The timer will stop with the next cut.

381
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:24,267
找到绿色的线 在右边的一组线中
Locate the green wire. It's in the group to the right.

382
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:36,156
Roger 我没找到绿线
Roger,I don't have a green wire.

383
00:28:38,846 --> 00:28:40,232
你看到有什么颜色的线?
What color wires do you have?

384
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:42,416
橙色 黄色 黑色和紫色
Orange,yellow,black and purple.

385
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,366
Jack 这个装置不一样
Jack,the devices don't match.

386
00:28:47,636 --> 00:28:51,762
别慌张 在我们这边想到办法之前不要再剪任何线了
Don't panic,and don't cut any more wires until we can figure this out on our end.

387
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:53,666
快点 我们的时间越来越少了
Hurry. We are running out of time.

388
00:28:58,846 --> 00:28:59,966
Jack 你走吧
Jack,you need to go.

389
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:01,886
你不走 我哪也不去
I am not going anywhere without you.

390
00:29:23,786 --> 00:29:24,786
来吧
Do it.

391
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:28,592
- 他们会再打来的   - 你必须这么做
- They are going to call back.  - You have to.

392
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:30,016
他们会再打来的
They are going to call back.

393
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:46,786
没事的
It's ok.

394
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:07,836
我是Jack Bauer
This is Jack Bauer.

395
00:31:07,836 --> 00:31:11,452
大楼三楼北侧科学实验室有我们的人受伤
We have a man down on the 3rd floor science lab northeast corner of the building.

396
00:31:11,476 --> 00:31:12,936
请求医疗救护
requiring medical assistance.

397
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:14,386
万分紧急 快
Emergency,now.

398
00:32:11,135 --> 00:32:12,895
能让我们单独谈谈吗?
Could you give us a minute,please?

399
00:32:21,645 --> 00:32:22,645
怎么了?
What's going on?

400
00:32:24,815 --> 00:32:25,935
我会被继续监禁
I am back in custody.

401
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:29,945
Hammond会带我去联邦法庭
Hammond's taking me down to Federal.

402
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:32,545
不 不 他们不能这么做
No,no,they can't do this.

403
00:32:33,115 --> 00:32:35,765
你今天做了很多事 他们不能这样
Not after everything you have accomplished today.

404
00:32:36,425 --> 00:32:40,525
Michelle 我置你的幸福在国家安全之上
Michelle,I put your well being above the country's.

405
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:44,805
没有什么人或事可以改变这一事实
Nothing anybody can say will ever change that fact.

406
00:32:50,195 --> 00:32:51,695
不 他们可以
Yes,they can.

407
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:57,881
- Tony 别这么说 我...  - Michelle
- Tony,don't talk like this. I...  - Michelle.

408
00:32:57,905 --> 00:33:00,195
我做不到 我不会放弃你的
I can't,I won't give up on you.

409
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:03,325
Michelle 拜托 求你了Michelle 别这样
Michelle,come on. Please,Michelle,don't do this.

410
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:15,815
宝贝 你还活着
Baby,you are alive.

411
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,935
而且没有人因为我所做的事而受到伤害
And nobody else got hurt because of what I did.

412
00:33:21,425 --> 00:33:23,185
这已经比我希望的强多了
And that's more than I hoped for.

413
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:27,385
我可以接受这样的结果
I can live with that.

414
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:30,945
就算是进监狱
Even in prison.

我想亲口跟你道声谢

421

这个国家又一次欠了你的情

I put you in an unimaginable position earlier today,

425
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:30,965
我让你结束自己一位同事生命

426
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:33,495

总统先生 这没什么可原谅的
Mr. President,there is nothing to forgive.

428
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:38,955
这是必须的
It's what had to be done.

429

这不是今天唯一的牺牲

可能还要过几天才能知道

434
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:56,665
他的手是否能复原
whether or not he can use his hand.

435
00:34:59,425 --> 00:35:01,471
好吧 等他好一点 能说话的时候

438
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:09,125
你知道吗 Jack 像你这样的人
You know,Jack,men and women like you,

439
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:13,375
你的勇气和献生精神让我自惭形秽
your courage and level of commitment humbles me.

440
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:15,581
谢谢你 总统先生
Thank you,Mr. President.

441

我会告诉反恐局的每一个人 您对他们的工作非常满意
I will let everyone know at CTU that you appreciated the job they did

442

Jack 还有件事
Jack,there's one more thing,

443
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,735
请你在公开之前不要对任何人提起
and please don't discuss this with anyone until it becomes public.

444
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,695
但我想私下里亲口告诉你
But I wanted you to hear it from me,personally.

445
00:35:31,055 --> 00:35:32,935
我决定不再寻求连任

446

这将是我唯一的任期

447
00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:39,771
总统先生 请允许我说两句
Mr. President,I hope you don't mind me saying so,

448
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:41,755
我认为你做了一个错误的决定
but I think you're making a mistake.

449
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:44,185
好了 不管对错 我已经决定了
Well,mistake or not,it's what I have decided.

450
00:35:46,415 --> 00:35:49,815
作为一个普通的公民 我希望能和你成为好朋友
When I am a private citizen,I hope we can become better friends.

451
