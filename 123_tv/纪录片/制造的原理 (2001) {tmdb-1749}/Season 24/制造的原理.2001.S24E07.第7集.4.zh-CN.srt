1
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:16,322
我属下刚刚了解到
My office has just learned

2
00:00:16,322 --> 00:00:18,982
近来与总统交往的女人
that the woman with whom the President is currently involved,

3
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:21,802
Anne Packard医生正由于
Dr. Ann Packard, is being accused

4
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:25,402
伪造临床药检结果而被指控
of helping to fabricate the results of a clinical drug trial.

5
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:26,542
我们处境不乐观
We got hit hard.

6
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:29,162
骑墙观望的选民很可能转而支持Keeler
Voters who were on the fence may have just fallen into Keeler's camp.

7
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,792
但是一旦他们发现Ted在撒谎 就会知道这是无稽之谈...
Well, that is ridiculous. Once they find out that Ted was lying...

8
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:34,162
但他们怎么会知道 Anne?
And how are they supposed to do that, Ann?

9
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:36,542
这一切都是人云亦云 这就是政治
It's he said, she said. See, this is politics.

10
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:39,272
并不像治病 所以麻烦你别掺和进来
It's not medicine, so do me a favor and stay out of it.

11
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:41,472
我现在替代Tony 给我最新消息
I'm taking over for Tony. Give me an update.

12
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,452
我们正试图和直升机联系
We're trying to make contact with the chopper.

13
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:45,882
现在我们已经找到了Kyle Singer 而病毒也被隔离
Now that we have Kyle Singer, and the virus is contained,

14
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:49,632
我们得联系Jack 让他明白 帮助Salazar逃离已无关紧要
we need to contact Jack, let him know that the attempted escape of Salazar is pointless.

15
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:53,012
Salazar的恐怖组织对我国造成严重威胁
Salazar's terrorist connections are a serious threat to this country.

16
00:00:53,022 --> 00:00:55,492
Salazar和Bauer都是弃子
Both Salazar and Bauer are expendable.

17
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:56,522
怎么了Chase?
What's going on, Chase?

18
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:58,652
你父亲在我联系上他之前就离开了直升机
Your dad got out before I could tell him about Kyle Singer.

19
00:00:58,662 --> 00:01:00,062
现在正和Salazar逃亡中
He and Salazar are on the run.

20
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:01,912
现在的关键是要让他知道
The only thing that matters right now is getting word to him that

21
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:03,642
病毒已经被隔离
the virus has been contained.

22
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:05,272
这样他就会交出Salazar
That way, he'll turn Salazar over.

23
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:09,972
上次的电话里 你兄弟给了FBI的联系方式
Your brother gave the FBI contact instructions in his last call.

24
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:12,762
他的飞机正准备接你
He's got a plane circling, waiting to pick you up.

25
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:15,472
你果然是最棒的 Jack
You really are the best, Jack.

26
00:01:15,562 --> 00:01:16,782
举起双手!
No te muevas, no te muevas! Te mato!

27
00:01:16,782 --> 00:01:17,812
到底怎么回事?
What the hell's going on?

28
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:20,762
你把我送到这儿来 我还会让你走吗?
You didn't think I was going to let you just deliver me and leave, did you?

29
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:21,892
Ramon!
Ramon!

30
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:41,642
Adam!
Adam!

31
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:45,042
Adam 这里出事了...
Adam, there's something seriously wro...

32
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:46,472
我刚想起来
I just remembered,

33
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:48,662
我没关那个文件夹
I forgot to close that file.

34
00:01:50,942 --> 00:01:55,812
以下事件发生于晚上7点至8点之间
The following takes place between 7:00 am and 8:00 am

35
00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:59,002
- Gael你在做什么? 放开我  - 对不起 Kim
- Gael, what are you doing? Let me go.  - Sorry, Kim.

36
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:01,512
- 不!  - 你不该扯进来的
- No!  - You shouldn't have walked into this.

37
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:05,592
冷静点 我只想问你几个问题 好么?
Calm down. I have to ask you a few questions, okay?

38
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,632
这个房间是是隔音的 如果你叫喊
Now, this room is soundproof, so if you scream,

39
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:12,952
除了惹我发火 别无他用 这不会是你希望的
it won't do anything but make me mad, and you don't want to do that.

40
00:02:14,152 --> 00:02:16,502
这点我们能达成共识吧?
So, we're going to be all right here?

41
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:23,072
你们对我父亲怎么了?
What are you doing to my father?

42
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:25,152
我来发问 明白?
I'll ask the questions, huh?

43
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:33,672
你是来更新登记记录的
You came in here to bring the logs backup to date.

44
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:36,282
他们估计你多久会完成?
When do they expect you to finish?

45
00:02:40,982 --> 00:02:43,382
我不会问第二遍
Don't make me ask you twice.

46
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:44,982
我不知道 10分钟
I don't know, ten minutes.

47
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:47,642
那么之后你的工作是?
And after that, what are you working on?

48
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:49,632
只是处理杂务
Just utility work.

49
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:52,062
很好
Good.

50
00:02:52,192 --> 00:02:54,632
你明白你在做什么? 这行不通的
What do you think you're doing? This isn't going to work.

51
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:29,522
Adam?
Adam?

52
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:31,772
- 怎么  - 你听说了没有
- Yeah?  - I don't know if you've gotten word,

53
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:34,692
Tony的手术已经完成 我准备几分钟后赶过去
but Tony's out of surgery. I'm trying to head over there in a few minutes.

54
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:36,102
那么你走了后 谁负责?
Well, who's going to be in charge when you're gone?

55
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:39,892
Gael 我要你将我所有的档案全部转移到他的系统里 明白?
Gael. I want you to unmount all my directories and transfer them over to his system, okay?

56
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:40,992
好
Sure.

57
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:41,992
有Jack的新消息么?
Anything new on Jack?

58
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:44,472
没 已知的最后踪迹是市中心的地铁站
No. Our last location on him was the downtown subway station,

59
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:46,402
之后Chase就跟丢了
and Chase lost his trail after that.

60
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:47,792
我们联系洛杉矶警局了么?
Have we contacted LAPD?

61
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,742
对 他们正为此忙着呢 地方FBI也是
Yeah. They're all over it. So is the local FBI.

62
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:50,222
很好
Great.

63
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:52,742
我不认为我们应该这样处理
I think we're going about this the wrong way.

64
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:56,272
Jack帮Salazar越狱 因为他认定唯有这样能阻止生化危机
Jack broke Salazar out of jail because he thought it was the only way to stop the bio threat,

65
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:58,842
但现在我们已经找到Kyle Singer 危机已解除
but now that we have Kyle Singer, there is no threat.

66
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:01,652
我们应该透露给媒体 Jack也许能得到消息
We should just saturate the media, and maybe Jack will get the message.

67
00:04:01,652 --> 00:04:02,922
但是总统明确指示
But the President made it very clear.

68
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:04,772
他现在并不想让大众得知生化危机
He does not want the public to know about the bio threat.

69
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:06,062
至少不是现在
Not at this point.

70
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:09,092
我们得独力找到Jack和Salazar
We have to find Jack and Salazar ourselves.

71
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:10,312
明白
Yeah.

72
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:14,992
Dessler.
Dessler

73
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:16,002
Michelle 是我
Michelle, it's me.

74
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:17,622
Gael 你为什么还不来电讯会议室?
Gael, why aren't you in the teleconference room?

75
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:18,662
简报马上要开始了
The briefing's about to begin.

76
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:22,222
Kim碰上了些隐藏的记录文件无法移动
Yeah, well, Kim bumped into some imbedded no-ops in the log files.

77
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:23,862
这要一会
It'll take a few minutes.

78
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:25,672
她能解决
She can handle that.

79
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:27,612
听着 我要尽快赶往医院
Look, I'm trying to head over to the hospital.

80
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:29,552
我要你快点 这样你可以暂替我
I need you up to speed so you can takeover for me.

81
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:30,832
我现在过来
I'm on my way.

82
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:31,842
谢谢
Thank you.

83
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,832
我会看着你
I'm watching you.

84
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:42,442
因此不要轻举妄动
So don't try anything.

85
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:46,022
明白?
Alright?

86
00:05:24,642 --> 00:05:27,672
将空袭警报的编码交给Gael
Transfer all blue alert key codes to Gael.

87
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:29,012
还有么?
Anything else?

88
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:30,362
没了 谢谢
That's it. Thanks.

89
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:39,482
洛杉矶已经脱离了病毒扩散危机
There is no longer an outbreak threat for the city of Los Angeles.

90
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:42,732
被Salazar手下所挟持的Kyle Singer
Kyle Singer, who is being held by Salazar's people,

91
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:46,742
并没有感染cordelia病毒 而是完全健康
was not carrying the cordelia virus and turns out to be perfectly healthy,

92
00:05:46,742 --> 00:05:50,332
但是我们确信Salazar的组织持有病毒
but we do know Salazar's organization has the virus,

93
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:53,922
因此寻找Ramon Salazar是首要事项
which means finding Ramon Salazar is our top priority.

94
00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:56,542
感谢前来 Gael
Thank you for joining us, Gael.

95
00:05:56,802 --> 00:05:59,332
如果你准备代替Michelle 准时点
If you're taking over for Michelle, be on time.

96
00:05:59,332 --> 00:05:59,762
抱歉
Sorry.

97
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:03,002
从现在起 我们将集中精力
I was just saying from this moment on, we are focused on one thing only

98
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:05,122
追捕Ramon Salazar.
and that's finding Ramon Salazar.

99
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:06,862
Adam 我们目前进行得怎么样?
Adam, where are we on that?

100
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:10,232
Jack和Ramon下了直升机后 我们就跟丢了
Um, after Jack and Ramon ditched the chopper, we lost their trail.

101
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:12,732
- 据我们所知 他们还在洛杉矶  - 他们呆不久
- For all we know, they're still in L.A.  - Well, they won't be for long.

102
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:14,842
我们怀疑他们正前往Mexico边境
We suspect they're heading for the Mexican border.

103
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:18,522
我们已经通知Mexico政府和其它的美洲中部各盟友
We've contacted the Mexican government as well as Central American allies.

104
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:20,692
我们要求他们监视所有空域
We're asking them to monitor all air quarters.

105
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:22,162
Chase Edmunds呢?
What about Chase Edmunds?

106
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:24,402
我估计他正在赶回来
I'm assuming that he's coming back here.

107
00:06:24,402 --> 00:06:25,952
别做没有根据的估计
Don't assume anything.

108
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,422
Ramon来口吧
Ramon, have a drink.

109
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:34,012
你是自由身了
You're a free man.

110
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,492
谢谢
Thank you.

111
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:19,412
Ramon...
Ramon...

112
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:30,182
你好 Jack
Hello, Jack.

113
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:33,452
我想告诉你 宴会举行的很不错
The party's going well. I wanted you to know.

114
00:07:34,082 --> 00:07:36,392
除此以外 还有
There's something else I want you to know.

115
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:38,702
不知为何 Hector想要留你一命
For some reason, Hector wants you alive.

116
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:41,602
也许他想要亲手杀了你
Maybe he wants to kill you himself.

117
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:43,862
也许他想看着我杀你
Or maybe he wants to watch me do it.

118
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,332
我不知道我能不能忍这么久
I'm just not sure I can wait that long.

119
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,472
Ramon
Ramon,

120
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:48,852
让我们继续宴会吧
Let's get back to the party.

121
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:52,162
来吧 那些女孩 Sandra等着你呢
Come on, the girls. Sandra is waiting.

122
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,372
- 喂?  - Chase 我是Ryan Chappelle
- Yeah?  - Chase, this is Ryan Chappelle.

123
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:08,652
你在干吗?
What are you doing?

124
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:10,072
试图找到Jack
Trying to find Jack.

125
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,422
反恐局的人都在找
So is the rest of CTU.

126
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:12,772
我可能已经有头绪了
Well, I may have a thread.

127
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:14,402
说吧
Tell me.

128
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:17,512
Jack和我曾经收拢过Hector Salazar的线人
Jack and I back pocketed some of Hector Salazar's contacts

129
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:18,502
都是地下组织的
That aren't on the books.

130
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:21,032
如果你有消息 我们会让别的行动组了解
If you have any information, we'll pass it on to another field team,

131
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:22,462
但我现在要你回来
but I want you back here.

132
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:25,162
Ryan没时间了 只要Jack把Ramon Salazar
Ryan, there's no time for that. As soon as Jack hands Ramon Salazar

133
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,962
交给他兄弟 他们就会杀了他
over to his brother, they're gonna kill him.

134
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:30,132
- Jack可能已经死了  - 在我获得实据前 我不会停手
- Jack may already be dead.  - Well, I'm not stopping until I know for sure.

135
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,452
Chase
Chase,

136
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:34,152
我要你立即回来
I want you back here now.

137
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:35,312
为什么?
Why?

138
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:38,262
因为我发现Jack在使用海洛因
Because I just found out Jack's been using heroin.

139
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:41,202
既然你是他的搭档 你一定知道
And since you're his partner, you must have known.

140
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,762
不 我不知道
No, I had no idea.

141
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:45,202
我不相信
I don't believe you.

142
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:47,532
我认为你一直帮他隐瞒着
I believe you've been covering for him all along.

143
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:49,552
长官 现在的关键是找到Jack
Sir, the only thing that matters right now is finding Jack,

144
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:51,222
呆在反恐局里 什么都干不了
and I can't do that from CTU.

145
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:54,192
如果你还想要继续干下去
If you even want a chance of keeping your job,

146
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:57,162
你就得马上回来 并且向我报告Bauer的情况
you'll get back here now and debrief me on Bauer.

147
00:08:57,222 --> 00:08:58,172
明白了么?
Do you understand?

148
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:01,052
- 明白  - 很好
- Yes, I understand.  - Good.

149
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:10,382
- O'Brian  - Chloe Kim在上面么?
- O'Brian.  - Chloe, is Kim up there?

150
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:13,012
- 不在  - 你的登记还是6小时前的吗?
- No.  - Are your logs still lagging by six hours?

151
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:14,322
让我看下
Let me check.

152
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:16,182
是的
Yup.

153
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:18,372
我以为Kim已经更新了
I thought Kim was supposed to take care of that.

154
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:21,892
我不知道Kim在做什么 我不了解她的安排
I don't know what Kim is doing. I don't follow her schedule that closely.

155
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,482
Gael...
Gael...

156
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:27,442
你现在要回维护中心么?
Are you going back to tech one right now?

157
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,132
不 现在不回 怎么了?
No, not right now. Why?

158
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:31,582
我需要Kim帮忙 没事 我会去找她?
Uh... I just need something from Kim. It's cool. I'll get her.

159
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:33,232
不 她不在那儿
No, no, she's not there.

160
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:35,222
她在 她在更新登陆信息
Yes, she is. She's backing up logs.

161
00:09:35,222 --> 00:09:38,712
她之前在 但是Chappelle让她给网络做个镜像
She was, but Chappelle asked her to bring a mirror drive down to networking.

162
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,692
几分钟内她就回来 你想要什么?
She'll be back in a few minutes. What do you need?

163
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:42,112
我想要什么?
What do I need?

164
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:44,052
我想要找到Jack
I need to find Jack.

165
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:46,282
我们四处碰壁 Kim是他的女儿
We're dead ending everywhere. Kim's his daughter.

166
00:09:46,282 --> 00:09:48,342
也许有她能帮我们处理我们忽略的部分
Maybe there's something we're overlooking she can help us with.

167
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:51,012
只要她一回来 我就让她找你 行么?
As soon as she gets back, I'll send her over, okay?

168
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:54,342
好吧
Yeah, okay.

169
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,702
Gael 我让Adam将我所有的信息转到了你的系统下面
Gael, I had Adam transfer all my directories over to your system.

170
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:01,302
- 你已经可以开始了  - 非常感谢
- You're good to go.  - Thanks. Great.

171
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:02,492
等下
Oh, hold on.

172
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:05,372
我要看下局里来的快电
I want to go over the dispatches from Division.

173
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,382
一共派出了17组人马
There's 17 units out in the field.

174
00:10:07,382 --> 00:10:10,032
其中5组还在市中心 试图寻找Jack的蛛丝马迹
5 of them are still downtown. They're trying to pick up Jack's trail.

175
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:11,242
其余的12组呢?
And the other 12?

176
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,962
卫生部 LAX...
Health services, LAX...

177
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:15,162
等等 让我把剩下的给你
Umm hold on, let me pull up the rest for you.

178
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:03,092
这是我用来调整人手的表格
This is the matrix I used to balance resources.

179
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:05,412
我会发给你的
I'll transfer it to you.

180
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:14,302
Tony的手术已经结束了?
Is Tony out of surgery?

181
00:11:14,812 --> 00:11:16,022
是的
Yeah.

182
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:17,612
他不会有事吧?
Is he going to be okay?

183
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:18,862
希望如此
Hope so.

184
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,272
- Dessler  - Michelle Gael和你在一起么?
- Dessler.  - Michelle, is Gael still with you?

185
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:45,452
- 对 怎么了? - 我进不了维护中心 密码失效了
- Yeah. Why?  - I can't get into tech one. I'm having trouble with the access code.

186
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,522
你把维护中心的密码改了?
Did you change the access codes to tech one?

187
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:48,722
不 怎么? 出什么问题了?
No. Why? What's going on?

188
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:51,432
- Adam进不去  - 他进去干嘛?
- Adam can't get in.  - What does he need?

189
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:53,922
- 你进去干嘛 Adam?  - 我在找Kim 她之前在这儿
- What do you need, Adam?  - I'm looking for Kim and she was in there.

190
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,402
- 你给她打电话了么?  - 电话出故障了
- Did you try calling her?  - There's something wrong with the phone.

191
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:59,642
你能强制打开门么? 门锁住了
Can you override the door? Cause it's tweaked.

192
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:01,242
没问题
Yeah, sure.

193
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:05,222
- 你在干嘛  - 覆盖密码
- What are you doing?  - Overriding the access code.

194
00:12:05,222 --> 00:12:07,582
也许键入板出现问题了
Probably something wrong with the keypad.

195
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:10,612
好了 我把密码改成 1-2-3-4
Okay, I'm resetting it to 1-2-3-4.

196
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,872
需要15秒时间
It'll take 15 seconds to sync, though.

197
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:14,082
多谢
Thanks.

198
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:19,052
我把所有和病毒有关的发到A盘
Okay, I'm sending everything related to the virus over to volume A.

199
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,962
你要Salazar的文件放到哪里?
Where do you want the Salazar file?

200
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:31,582
Kim?
Kim?

201
00:12:33,222 --> 00:12:34,812
天呐 Kim!
Oh, my god, Kim!

202
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:39,612
- Kim?  - Adam 是Gael干的
- Kim?  - Adam, it was Gael.

203
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,062
第5区没发现
Section 5 is clear.

204
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:53,992
我发现目标
I have a visual of the subject.

205
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:55,422
在第5区
Section 5.

206
00:12:57,272 --> 00:12:58,822
封锁他的出口!
Block him off on the other side!

207
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:00,682
下来! 快!
Get down here! Come on!

208
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:07,262
第七区 我封住了朝东走廊
Section 7. I'm blocking down the east corridor.

209
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:09,992
我没看见目标
I do not have a visual on the subject.

210
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:12,352
我重复 我没看见目标
I repeat. I do not have a visual on the subject.

211
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:14,882
请指示
Please advise.

212
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,482
第7区需要医生
We need a doctor on section 7.

213
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:29,192
我重复! 朝东走廊!
I repeat! The east corridor!

214
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,742
放下枪!
Put it down, put it down!

215
00:13:35,742 --> 00:13:38,392
别乱动 放下枪
Don't do it. Put it down, now.

216
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,602
Gael!
Gael!

217
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:47,572
别拦着我 Michelle!
Don't get in my way, Michelle!

218
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:50,182
外面的警卫已经各就各位了
External security is already in position.

219
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:52,702
你走投无路了
You're not going anywhere.

220
00:13:56,122 --> 00:14:00,462
你再越雷池一步 后果自负
You take one step outside, you know exactly what will happen.

221
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:40,644
好 我会的
Yeah, okay, I will.

222
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,897
谢谢
Thanks.

223
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:45,744
他们怎么说?
What did they say?

224
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:47,554
他们还没找到Jack Bauer
They haven't found Jack Bauer yet.

225
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,474
甚至不知道他还在不在城里
Not even sure if he's even still in the city.

226
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:51,304
他不在城里
He's not in the city.

227
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:56,584
他的计划是 把Ramon Salazar回他兄弟那里来阻止病毒扩散
His plan was to take Ramon Salazar back to his brother to prevent the outbreak.

228
00:14:56,704 --> 00:15:00,334
这就是他会做的 即使牺牲生命
That's what he's going to do, even if it costs him his life.

229
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:04,024
David 这没错 但是我们现在对此无能为力
You know, David, that's probably true, but there's nothing we can do about that now.

230
00:15:04,074 --> 00:15:08,394
我们的情报机关和军队正没日没夜的奋斗在前线
Our intelligence and military services are working overtime on that front, so

231
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:11,174
让他们去处理这事
let them do their job.

232
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:14,984
我们眼下还有别的麻烦要解决
We, unfortunately, have other fires to put out.

233
00:15:42,564 --> 00:15:44,354
David 我对Ted和这场辩论感到抱歉
David, I'm sorry about Ted and the debate.

234
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:46,454
别这么说
I don't want to hear it.

235
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:47,644
你没错
It's not your fault.

236
00:15:47,644 --> 00:15:49,904
是我让你去面对他
I was the one that told you to stand up to him,

237
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:52,434
也许我错了 也许你应该直接用钱把他打发走
but maybe I was wrong, maybe you should have just paid him off.

238
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:55,034
你并没有错
You were not wrong.

239
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:57,994
总统先生...
Mr. President...

240
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,724
我们还有很多要忙
we have a lot of work to do.

241
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:24,164
我依旧无法相信Gael会是叛徒
I still can't believe Gael could be a traitor.

242
00:16:24,254 --> 00:16:25,484
他说了什么?
Has he said anything?

243
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,754
我们还没开始呢 要先让他紧张
We haven't gone in yet. We're sweating him first.

244
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:33,244
听着Ryan
Listen, Ryan,

245
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:34,834
Tony的手术结束了
Tony's out of surgery.

246
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:36,204
我希望他醒来后能看到我
I want to be there when he wakes up.

247
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,144
而我需要你留在这儿
And I need you here.

248
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:39,854
我们刚抓到一个卧底
We just uncovered a mole.

249
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:42,484
我们不知道到底多少机密泄露到Salazar手中
We don't know how badly we've been compromised by Salazar.

250
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:44,404
有你处理这事就行了
But you're handling that.

251
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,384
如果忙不过来 你可以让Chloe帮忙
Anything that spills over, you can give to Chloe.

252
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:49,134
Chloe才是麻烦所在
Chloe's a pain in the ass.

253
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,174
她能行
She can do it,

254
00:16:51,174 --> 00:16:54,104
至少在我回来之前
at least until I get back.

255
00:16:56,174 --> 00:17:00,354
好吧 如果你认为可以丢下手头的工作
Fine, if you think you're dispensable.

256
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:04,524
我只是想陪着我丈夫
I just want to be with my husband.

257
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:09,304
好吧
All right.

258
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:10,804
谢谢
Thank you.

259
00:17:14,724 --> 00:17:17,074
让我们开始吧
All right, let's do this.

260
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:31,314
你忽悠了我们 Gael
You had us, Gael.

261
00:17:32,124 --> 00:17:36,214
现在我们逮住你了
Now we have you.

262
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:40,604
还有其它Salazar的卧底吗?
Were you working alone, or does Salazar have other moles inside?

263
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:45,114
你认识Johnson
You know Johnson.

264
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,044
你知道Johnson是干什么的
You know what Johnson does.

265
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:50,134
你也知道 迟早 你会把你知道的告诉我
And you know that sooner or later, you're going to tell me what you know.

266
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:54,444
问题是 你想要什么样的过程
The only question is how hard you make this on yourself.

267
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:59,114
Kim说你在监视Jack Bauer登上的飞机
Kim says you were monitoring a plane that had Jack Bauer on it.

268
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:01,074
真的么?
Is that true?

269
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:02,734
我无可奉告
I have nothing to say.

270
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:05,684
如果这是你在被揭露前 做的最后一件事
If it's the last thing you ever do,

271
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,844
你就得告诉我 那飞机要降落在哪里
you're going to tell me where that plane is landing.

272
00:18:57,164 --> 00:18:58,614
怎么了Ramon?
What is it, Ramon?

273
00:18:58,614 --> 00:19:00,154
你不喜欢这些美女?
Don't you like the girls?

274
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:02,554
告诉我为什么 为什么Hector要留Bauer一条命
Tell me again why Hector wants Bauer alive.

275
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:04,234
我不知道 他没有解释
I don't know. He didn't say, but...

276
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:05,904
但是...
But...

277
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:08,254
没为什么
but nothing.

278
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:10,924
我和Bauer不共戴天
Every Time Bauer takes a breath, he's an insult to me.

279
00:19:10,924 --> 00:19:14,324
因为他的背叛 我坐了3个月的牢
I spent three months in prison because of his betrayal.

280
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:17,714
我知道Ramon 我确信Hector也这么想
I know, Ramon, and I'm sure that Hector feels the same way.

281
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:20,084
那他不会介意
Then he won't mind.

282
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:21,874
Ramon别!
Ramon, no!

283
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:27,224
你在命令我么 Tomas?
Are you giving me an order, Tomas?

284
00:19:27,224 --> 00:19:28,884
Ramon
Ramon,

285
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:31,184
我为你们兄弟俩工作
I work for you and your brother.

286
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:33,484
我对你们敬爱有加
I love and respect both of you.

287
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:37,074
Hector命令我把Bauer活着带下飞机
Hector instructed me to keep Bauer alive until the plane lands.

288
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:39,804
而我命令你坐下
And I'm instructing you to sit down.

289
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,854
你为什么不尊重你兄弟的意见?
Why won't you honor the one wish of your brother,

290
00:19:41,854 --> 00:19:45,304
他一心谋划了你的潜逃
who arranged for your escape today?

291
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:46,944
在一小时之内
In less than an hour,

292
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:50,974
我保证你一定能报复Bauer
I am sure that you will get your revenge on Bauer.

293
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:04,644
我们走着瞧
We'll see.

294
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:09,524
给我再倒一杯
Pour me another drink.

295
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:11,664
是 Ramon
Yes, Ramon.

296
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:19,224
Pedro
Pedro.

297
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:21,674
我不该和你说话 Jack
I'm not supposed to talk to you, Jack.

298
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:23,434
好吧 那听着
Fine, then listen.

299
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:25,674
我拚着命将Ramon救出来
I risked my life getting Ramon out of prison.

300
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,414
也是你把他送进去的
You put him in prison.

301
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:32,324
Pedro 我有要事得告诉Ramon
Pedro, I need to tell Ramon something it's important

302
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:35,484
在他喝的酩酊大醉之前 你见过那样子
before he gets too wasted. You know what he's like.

303
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,644
是啊 有次他喝醉了 把某人扔下飞机
Yeah. Got drunk one time threw some guy off a plane.

304
00:20:38,644 --> 00:20:40,524
如果这次也一样
Keeps going like this,

305
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:42,774
你可能会比我们先着陆
you might be landing before we do.

306
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:45,844
- 看在上帝的份上 听我说一句  - 不 你听我说
- For god's sakes, listen to me.  - No, you listen to me.

307
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:47,704
我没话和你说
I'm not talking to you.

308
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,514
你已经死到临头了
You're a dead man.

309
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:07,114
Jack
Jack.

310
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:09,084
Jack
Jack.

311
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:12,134
Jack 别装腔了
Jack, quit screwing around, Jack. Jack.

312
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,400
最坏情况下 我们能以国防问题来解释你的离场
Bottom line is, I think we can explain the national security issue that pulled you off stage,

313
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,490
但是针对Ann的指控很难解决
but the allegation against Ann is going to be a lot harder to handle.

314
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,310
他的前夫肯定有自己的目的
Her ex-husband clearly had his own agenda.

315
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,540
要证明他是个骗子应该不难
And it shouldn't be difficult to prove that he's a liar.

316
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,980
我明白 大众很期待去了解其中的黑幕
I understand that, but this is dirty laundry, and we both know the public wants to hear it,

317
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,620
但如果你拿不出实证 Ann就会拖累你
and unless you can offer the public something definitive Ann is going to hurt you.

318
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,890
Jerry说得对
Jerry's right.

319
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,130
David 我作为你兄弟和顾问 我有些建议
Listen, David. I'm your brother, I'm your advisor and I do have some perspective on this thing.

320
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,870
你想听听看么?
Now, do you want to hear it?

321
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,590
好 说吧
Yes, I want to hear it.

322
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,530
- 和Ann保持距离  - Wayne...
- Distance yourself from Ann.  - Oh, Wayne...

323
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,470
先让我说完 再让我闭嘴
Before you shut me down, just hear me out.

324
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,500
由于Sherry 你已经人心尽失了
You used up the public's goodwill with Sherry.

325
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,520
他们不想知道你还和某些
They don't want to hear about you being involved with someone else

326
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,770
不值得信任的人相处
who's not trustworthy.

327
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,560
你得尊重你的选民
You have got to respect the people who voted for you.

328
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,200
对不起
Oh, excuse me.

329
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,080
喂?
Hello?

330
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,840
Ann 是我 Ted
Ann, it's me, Ted.

331
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,700
我们得聊一聊
We need to talk.

332
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,840
聊什么?
About what?

333
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,890
你还有什么能和我说的?
What could you possibly have to say to me?

334
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,490
以你所做的一切 我无法相信你居然还敢打来
After what you have done, I can't believe you have the audacity to call.

335
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,760
- 我很抱歉  - 好极了
- I'm sorry.  - Well, that's great.

336
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,770
你让事情变得好极了
Now everything's all right.

337
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,020
我因此才联系你 我希望弥补自己造成的损害
That's why I called. Because I want to make it right.

338
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,360
怎么做?
How?

339
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,450
你以为能挽回所做的一切?
How can you possibly undo the damage you've done?

340
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,910
来我办公室见我 我会解释一切
Come up in my office. Come up and I'll explain everything.

341
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,050
我不会去的
I'm not coming over there.

342
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,410
Ann 听我说
Ann, listen to me.

343
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,240
我有文件能够证明你清白
I have some documents that will prove your innocence.

344
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,460
什么文件?
What kind of documents?

345
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,220
信和备忘录
Letters and memos.

346
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,260
行么?
Please?

347
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,820
我只是想亲自交给你
This is how I want to do it. I want to give them to you personally.

348
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,370
我保证不会耍花样
I promise I won't make a scene.

349
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,770
- 我会让别人去拿的  - 不行!
- I'll send someone over to get them.  - No!

350
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,120
以我的方法办 不然我现在就把证据烧了
Now, we agree it's my way, or I swear I'll burn them right now.

351
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,200
好吧 希望你最好不要浪费我的时间
All right, but you'd better not be wasting my time.

352
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,580
Simon
Simon,

353
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,830
- 我们得谈谈  - Chase Edmunds
- we need to talk.  - Chase Edmunds.

354
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,070
很抱歉 我正在吃晚饭
Sorry, but I'm having dinner right now.

355
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,750
- 你想要什么?  - 我要消息!
- What do you want?  - I want information!

356
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,730
- 你疯了么?!  - 怎么了?
- Are you crazy?!  - What's going on?

357
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,350
Rita 把孩子带上楼
Rita, take the kids upstairs.

358
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,640
不会有事的
Everything will be fine.

359
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,550
你要查什么?
What do you want?

360
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,230
Ramon Salazar今天越狱了
Ramon Salazar broke out of federal prison today.

361
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,200
他会和他兄弟Hector会合
He's gonna hook up with his brother, Hector.

362
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,980
我告诉过你和Bauer 我是遵纪守法的会计师!
I told you and your partner Bauer that I'm a legitimate accountant!

363
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,140
我和Salazar兄弟没关系
I don't have any business dealings with the Salazars.

364
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,220
Simon我不是来抓你的
Simon, I did not come here to bust you.

365
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,760
但找不到Hector 我是不会走的
And I am not leaving until I know where Hector is.

366
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,620
你明白么?
Do you understand me?

367
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,910
我不知道Hector在哪儿
I don't know where Hector is now.

368
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,530
他两星期前离开了哥伦比亚
He left Colombia over two weeks ago.

369
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,790
他没有告诉你目的地?
And he didn't tell you where he was going?

370
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,820
没有
No.

371
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,450
你不是有他账户信息么?
You're tied into his money flow, right?

372
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,670
对
Yes.

373
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,140
有些
Some of it.

374
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,620
让我们看看
Let's take a look.

375
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,800
Ramon
Ramon,

376
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,540
Hector马上就要和我们见面了 再等几分钟
Hector is meeting us. Just wait a few minutes.

377
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,430
Ramon 拜托了 Hector说...
Ramon, please. Hector said...

378
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,320
你准备好受死了么 Jack?
Are you ready to die, Jack?

379
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,800
退后!
Back up!

380
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,870
退后 不然我就杀了他!
Get back or I'll kill him!

381
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,240
- 退后!  - 开枪 Thomas!
- Get back!  - Shoot him, Thomas!

382
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,730
开枪!
Shoot him!

383
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,610
我死了 他也活不成
If I die, he dies.

384
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,870
难道你要Hector看到这结果?
Is that what you want Hector to see when you get off this plane?

385
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,300
放下武器!
Drop the weapons!

386
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,670
Bajen.
Bajen

387
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,880
Jack 你已经走投无路了
Jack, there's no way out of this for you.

388
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,840
他说得对 我兄弟外面有一群部队
He's right. My brother has an army out there.

389
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,480
我们现在已经不在你老巢了 Jack
We're not in your backyard anymore, Jack.

390
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,120
这事我来担心 你只管坐下
I'll worry about that. You just take a seat.

391
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,080
美女们 别怕
Hey, ladies, don't worry.

392
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,590
一切都在掌握之中
Everything's under control.

393
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,960
等到着陆后 我们继续狂欢
The party will continue once we're on the ground.

394
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,670
伟大的美国英雄
The big American hero.

395
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,000
你觉得呢 Jack?
And what do you think, Jack?

396
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,120
Hector不也正等着你?
That Hector is not prepared for you, huh?

397
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,930
闭嘴
Shut up.

398
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,940
搞定了? 好
Lo tienes? Okay.

399
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,620
过来! 快!
Ven aca! Rapido, rapido!

400
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,880
快上车!
Come on! Get in the car!

401
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,700
为什么你需要那么人去接你兄弟?
Why do you need so many people to pick up your brother?

402
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,160
我想在飞机着陆前做好准备
I want to be prepared when the plane lands.

403
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,630
- 准备什么?  - 任何情况
- Prepared for what?  - Whatever.

404
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,200
我联系不上Gael
I haven't heard from Gael.

405
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,900
他本来该联系的
He should have checked in by now.

406
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,060
- 那么 为什么你不联系Ramon的飞机?  - 太危险了
- So why don't you call Ramon's plane?  - It's too risky.

407
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,270
美国人正在遍地搜索

I need to hear you promise, you're not gonna tell anyone you talked to me.

548
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:23,929
我不知道 Chase
I don't know, Chase.

549
00:35:23,939 --> 00:35:26,229
好好想想 相信我 Kim
Think about it. Don't do this to us, Kim.

550
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:28,579
- 这太冒险  - 我不是不相信你
- There's too much at stake.  - I'm not doing anything to us.

551
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:30,579
这事关你
This is about your life

552
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:31,629
和我父亲的生命
and my dad's.

553
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,199
听着 我知道这有多重要 见鬼
Look, I know what this is about, damn it.

554
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,759
好好听着 我得潜入
Just listen to me. I have to go dark.

555
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:37,389
没时间争执 必须马上去
There's no time to argue about it. Just do this.

556
00:35:39,129 --> 00:35:41,019
Kim.
Kim

557
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:43,699
多保重 Chase
Be careful, Chase.

558
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:45,209
Kim.
Kim

559
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,709
Kim!
Kim!

560
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:57,859
说吧 硬汉 你打算怎么着?
So, tell me, tough guy, what's the plan?

561
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,309
你迟早会知道
You'll know soon enough.

562
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:03,679
得了吧 我们都好奇着呢 和姑娘们说说
Come on, we're interested. Tell the girls.

563
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:09,669
你想等飞机降落后 逮捕Hector
So you think you're going to land the plane and arrest Hector.

564
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:14,669
不可能 即使是伟大的Jack Bauer 也无法孤身干掉50个人
No. Even the great Jack Bauer can't take 50 men by himself.

565
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,529
我明白了
Oh, I got it.

566
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:18,139
你准备把我扔下飞机
You're gonna drop me off,

567
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:19,749
开着飞机就跑
turn the plane around.

568
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:21,259
等下
Hey, but wait.

569
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:26,339
你已经是美国的通缉犯了 你准备去哪儿?
You are a criminal in America. Wanted. So where will you go?

570
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:30,549
我不觉得第三世界国家会欢迎你
I don't think a third-world country will suit you.

571
00:36:30,669 --> 00:36:33,359
这就叫进退两难 Jack
I think that's called a dilemma, Jack.

572
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,899
闭嘴
Shut up.

573
00:37:46,153 --> 00:37:47,803
Adam...
Adam...

574
00:37:48,163 --> 00:37:49,303
Chappelle在哪儿?
Where's Chappelle?

575
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:50,443
他和Gael在一起
He's with Gael.

576
00:37:50,453 --> 00:37:52,413
哪儿?
Where?

Interrogation 820.

578
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:56,493
走吧
Let's go.

579
00:37:59,473 --> 00:38:01,633
出了什么事?
What the hell's going on?

580
00:38:01,643 --> 00:38:03,673
我不知道
I don't know.

581
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:10,053
告诉我 你个狗娘养的
Talk to me, you son of a bitch.

582
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:11,513
关门
Get the door.

583
00:38:13,313 --> 00:38:14,313
Johnson 够了
Johnson, that's enough.

584
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:16,593
- Almeida 你来干嘛?  - 让他出去
- Almeida, what are you doing here?  - Get him out of the room.

585
00:38:16,593 --> 00:38:16,983
为什么?
Why?

586
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:19,583
相信我 Ryan 让他出去
Trust me, Ryan. Get him out of the room.

587
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:26,253
你也出去 Ryan
You, too, Ryan.

588
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:27,383
什么?
What?

589
00:38:27,393 --> 00:38:30,173
让我和Gael单独谈 相信我没错
I got to talk to Gael by myself, all right? Just trust me on this one.

590
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:32,883
Michelle 到底怎么回事?
Michelle, what's going on?

591
00:38:34,673 --> 00:38:37,403
我不在乎你们之间怎么回事
Look, I don't care what's going on between you two.

592
00:38:37,403 --> 00:38:40,123
我不会离开这间房间
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here.

593
00:39:08,253 --> 00:39:10,473
Ramon?!

594
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:18,653
Ramon?!
Ramon?!

595
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:34,313
Ramon人呢?
Where is Ramon?

596
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:38,263
我兄弟人呢?!
Where's my brother?!

597
00:39:39,203 --> 00:39:41,353
打死Bauer
Kill him. Kill Bauer.

598
00:39:41,353 --> 00:39:43,883
听到了么?
Do you hear me?

599
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:47,353
你在干吗 Jack?
What are you doing, Jack?

600
00:39:47,353 --> 00:39:49,603
你兄弟想在飞机上杀了我!
Your brother tried to kill me on the plane!

601
00:39:49,603 --> 00:39:52,123
为什么到处都是你的人?! 这和我们谈好的不一样!
Why all the guns?! This is not what we talked about.

602
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,443
放下武器!
Ibajen sus armas!

603
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:59,443
我担心死了 Gael也不知道你是否在飞机上
I was worried. Gael wasn't sure you were on the plane.

604
00:40:00,183 --> 00:40:01,883
到你兄弟那儿去
Go see your brother.

605
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:09,443
兄弟 很高兴见到你

We've been trying to get him back undercover with the Salazars.

618
