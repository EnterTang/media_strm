You want to call your dad and see if

50
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,100
i came here to ask you something.

51
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,170
Can you,like,make me a better poet?

52
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,860
You know,like,be my mentor?

53
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,250
Wh
- why do you want me to be Your mentor?

54
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,930
Because you're kind of awesome.

55
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,520
Damon,earlier tonight I
hit a woman with a belt.

56
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,050
Okay? I took off my belt
and i hit someone with it.

57
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,570
Over and over! I hit
my boss with a belt.

58
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,280
Well,maybe she deserved it.

59
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,020
No one deserves to be hit with a belt.

60
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,500
You invited me to your poetry thing,

61
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,140
And you helped me when i was tripping out
on pot scones,And i thought i was a fetus.

62
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,060
So you hit one lady over
the head with a belt.

63
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,680
So what?!

64
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,550
You changed my life.

65
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,960
Do you remember the
first time that we met?

66
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,890
You told me that i was funny.

67
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,440
I always thought that i was
funny,But no one ever said it before.

68
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,790
It's like we're in michigan

69
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,760
And everyone else here is the same.

70
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,150
Except you.

71
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,980
{\a6}* heaven isn't too far away *

72
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,830
{\a6}* Closer to it every day... *

73
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,810
- well,ron,that's the
thing about marriage.

74
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,300
And about women
- whim and fancy.

75
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,070
chicken and mole.

76
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,800
Man,on your big night
- ouch.

77
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,310
That's rough.

78
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,460
All right,i'm gonna get some
beef jerky. You want something?

79
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,360
- no thanks.
- come on.

80
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,730
Rice krispie treat,twix bar,nothing?

81
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,250
- maybe a twix bar.
- all right.

82
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,450
I didn't invite him to come with me.

83
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,700
He just
- he invited himself.

84
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,120
Oh sure.

85
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,460
I'm sorry she left you stranded.

86
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,660
It's an awful thing to do.

87
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,890
To leave like that?

88
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,840
Just walk out?

89
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,640
I'll be okay.

90
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,020
But in a way

91
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,400
I wish i could do the same thing.

92
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,580
Walk the fuck out.

93
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,470
My marriage is dead,ron.

94
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,040
I'm all alone all the
time,even when i'm not.

95
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,150
so am i.

96
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,570
- oh,ron.
- min,mindy!

97
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,100
I don't want to be stuck. I
don't want to be alone anymore.

98
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,890
- min.
- oh,ron.

99
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,810
I just
- i've always felt that there's something between you and me.

100
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,760
- oh,min
- this just feels so easy and so right. doesn't it?

101
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,170
- mindy.
- Oh,ron.

102
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,510
Ron,i wouldn't have
left you on that stage.

103
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,260
I wouldn't have left you
standing at that podium.

104
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,370
I would not have left
you alone on that stage.

105
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,870
- mindy,he's
- he's paying. He's signing his credit card.

106
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,830
hurry! Hurry hurry.

107
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,460
- oh,come on. - he's
exit- he's exiting.

108
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,120
- oh,hurry.
- he's coming!

109
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,790
- twix bar.

110
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,960
- thanks.
- Don't mention it.

111
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,600
no,i don't think you
understand me clearly.

112
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,920
Where am i even calling? Is this india?

113
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,850
Can i speak to your manager,please?

114
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,890
Listen,i know your
name is not john smith.

115
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,840
It's abdul or sharif or malik.

116
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,640
And you're in some call center in india.

117
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,170
So stop pretending your name
is john and you're in michigan

118
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,780
and get me your manager.

119
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,060
- my name actually is john.
- here,that's $1,000. i gotta get to work.

120
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,910
1,000? You're short.

121
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,920
1,000 is all i have,okay? You
wanna see my bank statement?

122
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,920
I need 500 more. This
is not a suggestion,ray.

123
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,330
It's not
pay-what-you-can.

124
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,200
Why don't you keep
that as a parting gift?

125
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,760
Oh,i'm sorry
- are you going somewhere?

126
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,910
Look,i-
i-

127
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,610
I need to-

128
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,070
Take a break.

129
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,240
A break from what?

130
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,820
from this business.

131
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,330
why,did your dick break?

132
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,110
I need to make some changes in my life.

133
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,100
Oh,okay.

134
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,500
Go ahead and quit. Go back to your tent.

135
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,520
Go back to being a nobody
with your nobody friend tanya.

136
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,430
- leave tanya out of it.
- fuck tanya.

137
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,910
She owes me a lot more than money.

138
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,380
I've got liz booked this afternoon.

139
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,340
Are you gonna see her or not?

140
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,800
What is going on,ray?
What is this about?

141
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,850
It's none of your business.

142
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,400
Is this about jessica?

143
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,800
what,you think you're gonna
get back together with her?

144
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,940
She left you for a reason,ray.

145
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,990
Maybe there's a reason
she wants me back.

146
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,840
Why? You think you've changed
and she's gonna come back to you?

147
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,770
I don't need this.

148
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,170
And i don't need you.

149
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,180
And i am not a nobody. I'm a father.

150
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,550
i'm a coach. I'm a teacher.

151
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,540
And i used to be a pretty good husband.

152
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,670
And if i get another shot at it,

153
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,560
I'm not gonna screw it up this time.

154
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,040
koontz!

155

Yeah.

164
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,100
Well,i don't know,ray. I'm not sure.

165
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,070
Well,you said you were-

166
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,410
A couple months ago.

167
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,660
thought i'd come to you first.

168
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,670
I'd better check with my wife.

169
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,240
Frances!

170
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,870

frightened. - go away!

172
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,120
You're gonna have to run me over.

173
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,350
If you don't move,i'm
gonna call the police.

174
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,860
Frances,please,i'm
just here to apologize.

175
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,460
I don't care why you're
here. i'm going to church!

176
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,280
all right,frances,please, Just
give me 30 seconds to apologize.

177
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,050
- may i approach your window,please?
- no!

178
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,670
- frances,i'm asking permission.
- no!

179
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,750
I'm not here to scare you or intimidate you
Or make you feel like you're being blackmailed.

180
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,560
I don't care why you're here.
I don't care why you're here.

181
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,230
I was wrong,all right? I'm guilty.

182
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,540
I'm going to pay back every penny.

183
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,080
When you go to church, Frances,
i hope that you will pray for me.

184
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,860
But for right
now,please,just for a moment,

185
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,230
May i approach your window
just for a moment,please?

186
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,830
Look,i know. I know i've been a bully.

187
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,500
I have given you every
reason not to like me,

188
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,950
But i'm not here to talk about me.

189
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,590
I'm here to talk about you and mike.

190
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,150
whenever i think of mike,i think of you!

191
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,720
i'm sorry.

192
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,200
when you're my age And you meet someone

193
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,040
And it turns out only to be a mirage-

194
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,830
Mike is not a mirage.

195
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,530
He's a nice man who
- he likes you so much.

196
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,950
- he would never do anything to hurt you.
- you don't understand.

197
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,620
I know i was paying for him.

198
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,500
Someday he'll look at
me and he'll remember.

199
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,470
I mean,what kind of woman...

200
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,180
Is willing to pay for sex?

201
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,750
What basis is that for a relationship?

202
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,710
Frances,you just have to believe

203
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,590
This man,he loves
you. Just believe that.

204
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,470
Frances,you and him,it's
whatever you want it to be.

205
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,530
Jess?

206
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,600
After the awards,

207
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,210
Mindy tried to jerk me off.

208
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,340
She tried,i stopped her.

209
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,280
I
- i took her hand

210
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,650
And i pulled it out of my pants.

211
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,020
- what?
- i told her. I said,"mindy, I need you to stop."

212
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,010
Mindy... Gave you a handjob.

213
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,070
That's not the point.

214
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,350
The point is You went to see another
dermatologist; mindy touched me;

215
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,470
They cancel each other out.

216
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,740
We're even steven,right?

217
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,560
No.

218
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
I need a break,ron.

219
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,300
Me and the kids,my mom,

220
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,620
We need to get away for a little while.

221
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,780
You know, I shouldn't have
told you about the handjob.

222
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,680
It's not about the handjob,ron.

223
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,050
Is that it?

224
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,440
Is that what happens?

225
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,900
I give you everything
i have, And you leave?

226
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,130
I can't live with you anymore.

227
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,940
Jess,

228
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,030
I forgive you.

229
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,390
If that's what you need,i
will sleep on the couch,

230
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,100
I'll sleep in the garage.

231
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,910
- i just need you to think about it.
- i've thought about it a lot.

232
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,700
I've thought about it a lot.

233
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,420
the players got that look.

234
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,140
The playoffs-

235
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,380
It's what the season's been about.

236
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,970
Now it's here.

237
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,020
They didn't make it by themselves,mike.

238
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,200
Our guys got there because you and me,

239
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,430
Well,we care a little bit
more than the rest of them.

240
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,290
We got hunter,round one.

241
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,480
That's a tough team. What do you think?

242
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,470
Ray,i'm sitting here because
this is still my desk.

243
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,600
And right now it's-

244
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,890
The best place for me to go.

245
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,360
Okay.

246
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,780
The third baseman's the
only real bat they've got.

247
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,920
We pitch around him,we'll be fine.

248
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,250
What else you got for me?

249
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,030
Mike,i fucked up. I had
no idea what was going on.

250
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,280
But i do know...

251
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,300
You were happy.

252
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,120
You shouldn't let that slip away.

253
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,100
- thanks for coming,jess.
- what are you doing,ray?

254
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,350
Ah,you were right.

255
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,100
I grew up here
- so what?

256
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,100
- what?!
- i'm selling the house.

257
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,450
Ray,you love this house.

258
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,340
I know,but i'm gonna get another house-

259
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,520
A bigger one,a better one.

260
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,180
It might not be by the lake,but...

261
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,510
Ray,i have to tell you something.

262
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,220
I have to tell you something too.

263
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,970
Last night in the lake,in the tent-

264
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,420
i don't want that to stop.

265
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,620
and i don't want you to go away.

266
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,060
I don't want you to forget about it

267
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,880
Or pretend it never happened.

268
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,790
I don't know what i'm doing,

269
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,650
But i do know i was happiest
with you, so I'm asking

270
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,050
What do i do?

271
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,570
Tell me what to do to get you back.

272
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,990
- just say it and i'll do it.
- it's not about that.

273
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,760
I was with you for 20 years.

274
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,710
I
- i love you.

275
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,690
I know you,but-

276
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,510
I can't be with you right now.

277
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,220
I can't just go from man to man.

278
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,370
I have to be on my
own for a little while.

279
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,480
Say okay,ray.

280
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,420
Say good luck.

281
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,100
Say you're proud of me.

282
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,130
did lenore talk to you?

283
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,550
I have to go.

284
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,450
Mom?

285
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,740
Wow,new office.

286
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,060
It's big.

287
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,080
You got "the seventh seal" framed.

288
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,960
What do you care? It
went right over your head.

289
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,390
Well,mom,i was 10. you took me to
see "the seventh seal" when i was 10.

290
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,990
Some parents never take their children
anywhere. What do you want,tanya?

291
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,650
Um,mom,i'm sorry,i
need to ask you a favor.

292
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,060
Just will you hear me
out before you say no?

293
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,990
I need to get the necklace back-

294
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,140
The gift?

295
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:04,240
And i need to get the
money back from marvin too.

296
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,850
He- he- he offered to
pay. Do you remember?

297
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,470
You want to be reimbursed for my dinner?

298
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,040
Mom,i know. I'm sorry.

299
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,140
Look,you were right. I can't afford it.

300
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,410
But,uh,please,

301
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
I need the money.

302
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,380
* there's a palace a
- falling *

303
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,630
* there's a smoke in the sky *

304
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,690
* there's a boy running down
into the lowlands tonight *

305
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,470
* and he's catching a train to
where he's heard you have been *

306
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,550
* he's a fool now among us *

307
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,050
* the dreamer within
dreaming of you... *

308
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,530
* and you know it's a lion's heart *

309
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,040
* that will tumble and tear apart *

310
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,160
* when he's coming
down the hills for you *

311
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,900
* well,he'll walk in the city forever *

312
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,490
* oh,walk in a time to be gone *

313
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,240
* well,there's no real
goodbye if you mean it *

314
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,160
* so i guess i'm forever alone *

315
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,500
* and you know it's a lion's heart *

316
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,640
* that will tumble and tear apart. *

317
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,000
Howard,it's,

318
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
a little low.

319
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,100
It's cash,ray.

320
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,160
My house is worth twice this.

321
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,590
Nobody can get a loan these
days,ray. Everything's crashing.

322
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,290
We save on broker fees.
I'll write you a check.

323
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,250
What do you say?

324
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,400
I'll get back to you.

325
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,970
- you can't sell the house,dad.
- i'll get another one.

326
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:27,110
- yeah,but we like this house.
- you'll have your own rooms.

327
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,310
Why can't you just finish fixing
this one,like you promised?

328
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,590
- we're like orphans.
- you're not orphans,guys.

329
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,110
Orphans don't have parents.
You have two great parents.

330
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,370
- then we're homeless.
- homeless orphans. This sucks.

331
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,260
You're not homeless. I have a home
and i'll have another home soon.

332
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,940
Yeah,but right now we're living in a hotel
And we left all of our stuff at ronnie's.

333
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,810
He's probably like in my room
right now, touching all my stuff.

334
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,450
- sniffing it.
- Guys,knock it off,will you?

335
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,120
Your mother needs her space right now,

336
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,830
And you need to support that.

337
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,710
She needs space from that weirdo
lenore. I mean, Why is she always around?

338
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,400
She's not around right now.

339
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,730
Right now it's just
the three of us,right?

340
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,560
And we've got hamburgers and hot dogs.

341
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,150
okay? Who's hungry?

342
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,570
Dad,did you invite tanya?

343
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,880
- hi.
- hey.

344
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,740
We're having a barbecue.

345
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,170
yeah,great-

346
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,760
It smells great.

347
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,360
Can i talk to you for a second?

348
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,080
Take over,will you? I'll be right back.

349
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,620
So i
- i got the money,ray.

350
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,110
I got it all back and
i'm giving it to frances.

351
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,250
that's not good enough.

352
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,980
no,i know. I know.

353
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,980
i trusted you.

354
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,530
look,i fucked up,okay? I fucked up.

355
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,130
I don't know,i just-

356
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,210
I didn't do any of it to hurt
you or mike or frances Or anyone.

357
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,100
I just got off track.
I don't- i don't-

358
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,870
i don't even know what happened.

359
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,990
Look,i just
- i need you to forgive me,okay?

360
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,590
That is so fucked up.

361
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,330
Come here. C'mon.

362
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,500
What,are you gonna drown me in the lake?

363
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,920
I'd understand if you did.

364
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,890
Or if you wanted to.

365
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,620
i don't.

366
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,170
where are we going?

367
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,370
This is my favorite place in the world.

368
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,410
So,um,so that's it?

369
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,730
You're gonna be with
lenore now for good?

370
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,660
I don't know.

371
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,130
I told her i quit.

372
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,070
- you did?
- yeah.

373
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,530
How did that go over?

374
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,680
You know,it's lenore. How do you think?

375
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,390
I- i think i'm still
in love with my ex-wife.

376
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,110
But i got no money,

377
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,620
She's best friends with lenore-

378
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,340
how am i supposed to get her back?

379
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,010
maybe i could help.

380
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,480
you wanna help me get my wife back?

381
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,530
i could try. I know a lot about women.

382
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,830
Yeah okay,tanya.

383
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,920
Come on,ray,we've made women happy,

384
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,150
All right,with happiness consultants.

385
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,380
Until we forgot the happiness part.

386
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,190
You think?

387
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,430
We could do it again,if you wanted.

388
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,990
Can i stay for the barbecue?

389
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,800
Okay.

390
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,420
i remember the day we moved in.

391
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,730
i was six years old.

392
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,730
i thought it was the
greatest house i'd ever seen

393
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,870
and i was the luckiest kid in detroit.

394
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,260
it was time to get lucky again.

398
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,600
{\a6}* There were moments of
dreams i was offered to save *

399
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,960
{\a6}* I lived less like a workhorse *

400
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,830
{\a6}* More like a slave *

401
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,170
{\a6}* I thought that one quick moment *

402
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,230
{\a6}* That was noble
or brave would be worth *

403
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,050
{\a6}* The most of my life *

404
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,400
{\a6}* So i pointed my fingers *

405
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,390
{\a6}* And shouted a few quotes i knew *

406
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,530
{\a6}* As if something that's written *

407
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,570
{\a6}* Should be taken as true *

408
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:18,770
{\a6}* But every path i had
taken and conclusion i drew *

409
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,420
{\a6}* Would put truth
back under the knife *

410
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,190
* And now the only piece of advice *

411
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,140
* That continues to help... *

412
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,700
* When *

413
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,990
* My time comes *

414
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:55,000
* Oh-hhh. *
