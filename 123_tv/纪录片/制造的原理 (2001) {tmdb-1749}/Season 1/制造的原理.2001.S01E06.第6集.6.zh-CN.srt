4
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,170
Just because we've lost,just because
the past is not what we wanted it to be,

5
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,860
doesot mean we cannot change.

6
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,590
In an instant,we could.

7
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:13,340
What do you want to think tonight when you replay
this in your head with the lights out,trying to sleep?

8
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,060
I'm sorry I'm late.

9
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,120
No problem.

10
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,620
Nice scarf.

11
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,050
Oh,really? You like it?

12
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,160
Looks good on you.

13
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,040
Thanks.

14
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,680
Are you ready?

15
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,350
Yeah.

16
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,140
What are we doing?

17
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,150
Don't ask me that.

18
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,600
Okay.

19
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,110
Are you nervous?

20
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,110
Um,should I be?

21
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,790
Yes,I'm nervous.

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,030
Well,don't be.

23
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,370
Come on.

24
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,790
Thank you for coming,jim.

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,900
it's okay to feel a little uneasy.

26
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,820
This must be difficult for you.

27
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,930
it means a lot to me that he's here.

28
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,720
Of course it does.

29
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,930
It does mean a lot,

30
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,540
because you have to understand I'm gonna confront
you head on and most men would run from that,

31
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,770
so thanks for being here.

32
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,760
You're welcome.

33
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,620
So what did you want to confront?

34
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,610
Should I just jump in here?

35
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,780
If you want to.

36
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,620
I want to say to you,jim,that-- that your
money destroys you-- your father's money.

37
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,190
I-it's like-- it's like
you're choking on his vomit.

38
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,390
It makes me want to weep,

39
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,060
because sometimes I picture you without
him and his money¡ªand the money¡ª

40
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,070
and you're a completely
different human being.

41
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,910
You don't do what you did,jim.

42
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,930
Not to me. Not to anyone.

43
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,660
You just--
you just don'T.

44
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,390
I don't know what to do with him!

45
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,460
He's like a stone wall.

46
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,880
I don't-why did he even-- why
did he even agree to come here?

47
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,370
Do you-- does
she want--

48
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,780
don't talk to him.Talk to me.

49
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,690
Explain to me why it happened.

50
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,000
Maybe you went for
the wrong kind of guy.

51
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,900
Just tell me,for fuck's sake!

52
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,880
Jemma.

53
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,690
Swear the fuck out!

54
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,230
I don't know why!

55
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,210
Jemma,I don't know why things
happen in my life or-or your life!

56
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,430
If I had to take a guess,I'd have to say
something about you is a big,fat turn-off!

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,330
Oh,like now?

58
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,680
Am I a turn-off right now?

59
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,210
No.

60
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,850
Are you okay?

61
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,820
Yeah,I'm fine.

62
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,610
So,uh,what was that about,exactly?

63
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,530
It doesn't matter.

64
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,280
That's it?

65
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,230
What am I supposed to do now?

66
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,130
I don't care what you do.

67
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,730
- Jemma paid me.
- Paid you?

68
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,070
Yeah,your cut's in my desk.

69
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,930
Don't worry. I locked it.

70
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,260
Paid you? For what?

71
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,280
It's a long story.

72
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,590
She booked me for a session.

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,990
When?

74
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,250
It's over already. Just now.

75
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,890
I-I-I saw her on
my lunch break.

76
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,640
She called me late last night.

77
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,630
What was I supposed to do?

78
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,010
If a client calls you
directly,you tell me immediately.

79
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,870
It's not cool.

80
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,000
There's a protocol.

81
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,860
She paid me $500.

82
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,520
What wrong with that?

83
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,710
Look,last week you went to
her house behind my back.

84
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,600
Now she's calling you at
all hours of the night.

85
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,310
It was a decent hour.

86
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,740
I'm going to have a
little talk with her.

87
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,740
I-don'T. That's not a good idea.

88
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,540
Why not?

89
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,140
She-she's having a hard time.

90
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,450
And you know this because...

91
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,230
She took me to see her therapist.

92
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,450
Yeah,I think that's why she hired me.

93
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,870
I think I'm supposed to help
her,you know,work shit out.

94
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,220
A million things come to
mind,but I'm not gonna say them.

95
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,760
I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut.

96
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,150
Leave her alone,okay?

97
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,350
I'll talk to her about the rules.

98
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,080
Okay.

99
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,380
I've gotta go.

100
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,030
Are you drinking enough water lately?

101
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,660
What?

102
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,810
You look dehydrated.

103
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,400
What's that? Some kind
of dermatology put-down?

104
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,680
No,baby,water's excellent for the skin.

105
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,680
Yup. It's also good for depression.

106
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,000
You lost your dog-- he
died-- and that's rough.

107
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,800
I'm sick of water,ron.

108
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,670
I want to talk about money.

109
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,420
What about it?

110
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,050
Do we have it?

111
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,470
Are we rich or are we poor?

112
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,550
I can't tell.

113
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,740
We drive a mercedes,and we pay for
natasha,and on the other hand doris is dead.

114
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,590
Well,we're not rich or
poor,jess,but we did lose a lot--

115
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,660
- 30%,maybe 40%,so--
- 40%?

116
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,730
Yeah,I've got to get to the office.

117
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,630
40% of what,ron?

118
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,910
This is what is so frustrating.

119
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,820
Ron,you don't tell me anything.

120
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,940
Is there something you want to buy?

121
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,940
Is there?

122
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,890
Are you feeling neglected?
Are you feeling deprived?

123
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,660
Because say the word,I'll buy it.

124
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,070
And if I can't afford
it,I'll hock my jaeger.

125
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,240
I'll wash dishes.

126
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,080
I'll eat hot coals for you,baby.

127
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,570
I don't want you to eat hot coals,ron.

128
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,360
I just... need to know the numbers.

129
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,460
I don't know the exact numbers,jess.

130
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:01,110
But if you want to help,you can make a
list of potential household cutbacks or...

131
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,070
you could always get a job.

132
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,230
I still haven't heard
anything,so good luck with that.

133
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,100
- Thanks for meeting me here.
- What?

134
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,680
I left you a message about us meeting.

135
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,350
You guys go ahead. I'll catch up.

136
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
I'm sorry. What are you doing here?

137
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,150
I know you're busy because
you haven't called me back,

138
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,890
but I was in the neighborhood¡ªI
was nearby,so I thought¡ª

139
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,080
terry,I'm working.

140
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,050
This is my place of work.

141
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,410
It's tanya.

142
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,130
Okay,why don't you just
tell me why you're here?

143
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,010
Oh,listen to me. I thought I made myself
pretty clear in our initial interview.

144
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,760
Now what you wanted
was a little unorthodox

145
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,140
and I said,"fine,as long
as you respect our rules."

146
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,680
and one of those rules is you do
not contact or pay a client directly.

147
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,390
Hold on.

148
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,640
hey,Yeah. Yeah,I'll be right there.

149
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,330
Don't let him see it,brad.

150
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,180
It's pretty simple what--
so that's the way it goes.

151
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:10,150
I know,as a businesswoman,you understand after
years of working that there are certain systems...

152
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,560
that keep the trains
running on time that...

153
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,260
I will be right up.

154
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,930
I-what are you talking about?

155
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,690
Our parameters.

156
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,930
What if I just ignore you
and do whatever I want?

157
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,840
What?

158
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,630
What's stopping me from-- I don't know--
just not bothering to listen to you?

159
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,650
Well,I would stop you.

160
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,220
It's my service.

161
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,760
I'm the one who makes the rules.

162
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,740
Jemma. Jemma,I do not
suffer fools gladly.

163
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,290
Now look,ray--
ray is my employee.

164
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,280
Now you cannot get to
him except through me.

165
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,460
We are inextricably linked.

166
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,060
Who's ray?

167
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,850
You mean randall?

168
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,200
No,I do not mean randall.

169
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,010
I mean,there is no ray.

170
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,360
You know what? You're fired.

171
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,630
That's right. I'm
firing you as a client.

172
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,620
You know,I've had enough
of you and women like you.

173
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,980
Good riddance!

174
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,550
It's pretty good,huh?

175
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,590
I mean,check out the new panel.

176
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,010
It still smells a little wonky,though.

177
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,050
It's normal.

178
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,930
Anyway,I'll fix it...before
we move you guys back in.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,610
Cool.

180
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,420
Great.

181
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,670
Let's choose some wheels.

182
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,810
All right. I circled the
ones I think are good.

183
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,710
You tell me which one's
got your name on it.

184
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,100
An '89 mustang?

185
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,130
Yeah,vintage-- it says so right
there in the ad.Heck of a car.

186
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,590
It's got 120,000 miles.

187
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,310
So?

188
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,730
Those are highway miles.

189
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,030
I talked to the guy selling it.

190
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,290
all right,whatever. You guys decide.

191
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,680
Hey,where are you going? I
thought we were buying a car.

192
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,700
She doesn't give a shit,dad.

193
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,440
All she cares about is
her fat-ass boyfriend.

194
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,310
Hey hey,give it a rest,damon.

195
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,270
Maybe she sees something you don'T.

196
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,730
What are you talking about?

197
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,900
I'm saying people are complex.

198
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,910
They're like... onions.

199
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:14,120
You peel a layer and sometimes you
find something you weren't expecting.

200
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,070
No,you don'T. You just find more onion.

201
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,470
holy cow,ray.

202
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,050
This place is really coming along.

203
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,050
It still really smells though.

204
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,440
so it
this your--

205
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,180
You must be ray's¡ª

206
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,730
yeah,tanya,this is my kid.

207
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,300
Damon,tanya.

208
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,930
I think I see the resemblance.

209
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,580
Yeah,the eyebrows,right?

210
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,510
Damon,we'll be right back.

211
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,490
Take a look at the '89 mustang,huh?

212
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,930
You can use this time to get excited.

213
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,980
Nice meeting you.

214
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,300
Oh yeah,you too.

215
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,750
Thanks,tanya.

216
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,120
Now my kid thinks you're my girlfriend.

217
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,950
What? Just because I
show up at your house?

218
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,280
Don't be infantile.

219
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,090
What do you want?

220
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,040
I've got great news.

221
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,590
I caught up with molly and she wants
to book you again for saturday night.

222
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,370
This saturday?

223
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,130
Yeah,you can go on the early side and then
come over and meet me and download after.

224
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,310
I got a bunch of netflix films.

225
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,830
We'll all pop some
popcorn,you can come over.

226
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,180
Tanya. I've got a life.

227
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,200
I've got a game this saturday.

228
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,310
Okay,so maybe we'll make it friday then.

229
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,860
No,jemma mentioned she wanted friday.

230
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,540
Don't worry. I'll make
her book through you.

231
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,930
Okay,it's too late for that.

232
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,020
I made an executive decision.

233
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,650
What are you talking about?

234
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,690
I'm an executive too. She's fine.

235
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,910
No,she's rude and I fired her.

236
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,710
I fired her.

237
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,140
I lost my temper.

238
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,240
I fired her.

239
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,070
Well,unfire her!

240
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,720
Jesus,tanya. Why did you
have to go mess this up for?

241
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,710
I'm not messing this up.

242
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,290
I'm fixing it,okay?

243
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,750
I'll-I'll fix it.

244
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,120
I-I-- just
leave me alone.

245
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,440
Mom,I'm not-- I do not
feel comfortable with this.

246
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,870
Ronnie's a private person. I
want to respect his privacy.

247
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,330
So? You go.

248
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,440
What about you?

249
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,410
I stay and not respect his privacy.

250
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,530
look-credit card bills.

251
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,890
Visa.

252
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,400
Mastercard.

253
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,000
More visa.

254
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,910
What does it prove?

255
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,890
Poor people don't spend so much.

256
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,350
Only rich ones.

257
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,540
make sure you put everything back.

258
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,560
He's gonna notice if
things are disturbed.

259
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,780
You are wife.

260
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,070
You have right to know
when husband is liar.

261
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,760
He's not a liar,mother.

262
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,500
He is worse than liar.

263
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,380
Treats you like child.

264
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,970
Worse than child.

265
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,890
He treats you like
pet,like your dead dog.

266
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,330
What are you talking about?

267
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,260
You want little needle in your face?

268
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,480
Too much wrinkle here.

269
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,840
Too much pimple there.

270
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,200
He takes care of me,mother.

271
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,410
He takes care of you.

272
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,930
How much money he has?

273
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:00,830
Do you know?

274
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,860
Of course not,because he
doesn't want you to know.

275
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,710
that's enough. You're driving me crazy.

276
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,580
Put it away.

277
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,850
Stock exchange.

278
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,620
I find the most important file.

279
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,080
Now you tell me he's not rich.

280
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,510
$833,000.

281
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,780
Why is it in parenthesis?

282
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,180
It's a loss,mom.

283
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:40,980
It means he lost $833,000.

284
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,370
Okay,so maybe I wrong.

285
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,950
Maybe he lost money.

286
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,550
You hungry? I make something to eat.

287
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,320
this is jemma. Be patient.
You'll get an answer eventually.

288
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,340
no. Hey,jemma. It's tanya.

289
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,870
Listen,I've got some terrific news.

290
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,940
Despite our previous miscommunication,I
had a discussion with randall

291
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:12,930
and we've decided to allow you to keep your
membership,provided you respect our rules.

292
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,890
Just please give me a call
at your convenience,okay?

293
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,950
you should call her back.

294
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,540
I'm sorry.

295
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,340
I've been swamped.

296
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,780
But really,randall,all that talk
about regulations and parameters?

297
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,240
She is a trip,your tanya.

298
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,680
She's not my tanya.

299
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,730
Well,she's your madam,isn't she?

300
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,160
I thought I was a book editor.

301
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,450
Oh,book editor.

302
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,490
That's so yesterday.

303
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,980
What's your real name?

304
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,310
I can't tell you that.

305
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,400
Why not?

306
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,800
Take a leap of faith.

307
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,090
And if you can't,just make something up.

308
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,700
I'm not gonna know the difference.

309
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,970
My name is ray.

310
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,710
- More? Tell me more.
- No.

311
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,070
- Please.
-  No.

312
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,660
I'll pay you... lots.

313
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,960
What do you think I am,a whore?

314
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,310
Yeah. Yes,you're a whore.

315
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,200
You're so funny,you're so
hot and I'm very into you.

316
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,690
But you're going to tell me.

317
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,050
Is this all you do?

318
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,620
Are you a fireman?

319
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,710
No.

320
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,110
Policeman?

321
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,770
No.

322
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,900
A plumber?

323
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,960
No.

324
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,560
Stop torturing me.

325
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,850
No.

326
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,650
You're making me want to fk you.

327
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,250
I'm gonna charge you double.

328
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,280
Tell me what you
fucking do for a living.

329
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,090
I'm a coach.

330
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,030
I'm a high-school basketball coacH.

331
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,540
I want to see you do it.

332
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,080
I mean coach.

333
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,300
come on! Defense!

334
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,030
Oh,come on.

335
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,580
It was looking like another losing game.

336
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:05,320
So many teams were having us for
lunch,I barely remembered how to win.

337
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,900
He didn't touch him!

338
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,770
Come on,ref. Call it both ways.

339
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,400
Ref's making bogus calls all night.

340
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,720
what are you looking at,ray?

341
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
Get your head in the game.

342
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,250
That's the half.

343
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,200
Wolves 26,tomahawks 36.

344
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,660
Oh my god,I love that lip gloss.

345
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,560
Hi,can I have one ticket for
the wolves and two buttons?

346
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,010
You mean the game.

347
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,920
Right,the game.

348
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,570
Thank you.

349
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,050
Damon,right?

350
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,030
How are you?

351
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,830
I'm good.

352
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,450
Fight,wolves,fight!

353
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,850
Are you-- do you-do
you go to the games?

354
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,980
Oh,no. No,I just-- I was
home,I'm having a moody night,

355
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,330
so I thought I should
be around human beings.

356
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,940
yeah,well,there's human
beings here,I guess.

357
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,950
If you kind of like that thing.

358
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,820
You're funny,aren't you?

359
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,950
Yeah.

360
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,610
I guess I-- I guess I kind
of have a funny personality.

361
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,070
Oh,hey,sweetie. Are you ready?

362
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,740
Mom,this is a friend of dad'S.

363
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,400
A friend of dad'S.

364
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,040
I'm jessica.

365
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,080
Tanya.

366
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,630
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

367
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,490
You're darby,right?

368
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,510
Uh,yeah.

369
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,770
Great.
Well--

370
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,990
so let's get back to the game,huh?

371
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,090
Where are you sitting?

372
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,940
Me? Oh,I don't know.
Anywhere. I don't know.

373
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,300
51 is killing us out there.

374
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,460
Yeah.

375
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,190
I knew I should've paid more attention.

376
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,730
My heart just wasn't in it.

377
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,020
Pazderka,box his ass out,okay?

378
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,630
This is varsity. Come on.

379
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,460
In two years,no one came to my games.

380
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:07,960
Now here we were in the worst losing
streak of my life and my ex-wife,

381
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:13,180
my two kids and my pimp were all
sitting up there side by side.

382
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,300
Let's go! Come on!

383
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,410
What's wrong with dad?

384
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,820
He seems kind of out of it.

385
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,300
I don't know.

386
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,120
Has he been putting on weight?

387
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,160
I think he lost weight.

388
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,940
Must be all that camping.

389
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,630
Do you have any idea how
much of an idiot you are?

390
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,920
I mean,you don't even
have a personalitY.

391
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,220
I do too have a personality.

392
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,200
No,you don'T.

393
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,000
Even the goth kids
think you're a poseur.

394
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,960
Kids,please.

395
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,930
I know what you mean.

396
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,210
How old are yours?

397
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,480
Oh no. I-I just teach kids.

398
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:52,140
I mean I used to teach kids
poetry before the budget cuts.

399
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,050
So do you come to ray's games often?

400
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,340
Who,me? Never.

401
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,780
I mean,I did when we were married.

402
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,880
I was head cheerleader back in my day.

403
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,970
But no,tonight I
figured "what the heck?"

404
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,450
My husband's working late.

405
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,740
I'm an adult.

406
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,970
I'll just go have a great night with my two lovely
kids and watch the wolves like we used to,huh?

407
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,850
Right,kids? Isn't this fun?

408
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,470
That's nice.

409
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,080
How do you know ray again?

410
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:27,240
We're friends--
good friends.

411
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,610
It's complicated--
me and ray.

412
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,040
How so?

413
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,420
Nice shot!

414
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,690
Go,wolves!

415
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,940
No,that was for the other team.

416
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,200
We're the white team.
They're the red ones.

417
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,640
Time out,time out,time out. Time out.

418
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,790
Bring it in,bring it
in. Let's do it. Come on.

419
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,620
This team is not seven points
better than us. All right?

420
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,700
All we've got to do is
we've gotta make more shots.

421
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,390
It's a simple game,guys.

422
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,700
And then she came.

423
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,180
She made me tell her,but I
didn't think she'd really show up.

424
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:09,170
And then suddenly I felt
it-- I wanted to win.

425
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,230
I wanted to win while she watched.

426
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,330
All right. Mike,I've got this.

427
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,550
Listen,guys,it's not about shots.

428
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,490
It's not about them.

429
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:30,560
This is about you-- what's inside
of you-- what's inside of you.

430
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,790
What do you want to think tonight when
you replay this game inside your heads

431
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,860
with the lights out and
you're trying to sleep?

432
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,840
That you gave it 70%?

433
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,440
Or 80%?

434
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:51,190
If we don't give it our all,if we
don't give it everything we've got,

435
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,740
then it don't matter what
the scoreboard says-- we lose!

436
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,950
If we believe we're better
than others believe we are...

437
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,460
if we play with our hearts,the
box score doesn't matter.

438
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,130
The scoreboard...

439
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,830
doesn't matter.

440
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,040
We win.

441
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,900
We win.

442
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,920
"Defense" on three.

443
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,720
All right,guys,one two three.

444
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,390
Defense!

445
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,390
come on,ref!

446
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,200
Don't let that big street zip code
affect the way you ref the game!

447
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,780
Sit down and shut up!

448
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,690
You sit down!

449
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,330
let's go,wolves!

450
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,150
Let's go!

451
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,340
let's go,wolves!

452
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,890
Let's go!

453
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,970
Let's go,wolves!

454
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,120
She wanted to see me coach.

455
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,040
I wasn't going to let her see me lose.

456
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,610
She was gonna get her money's worth.

457
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:12,040
And this losing streak--
this streak was gonna end.

458
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,730
Trap! Trap!

459
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,710
no fouls. No fouls.

460
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:29,940
And the final score is the wolves
scoring 56 points to the tomahawks' 55.

461
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,360
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

462
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,160
just great.

463
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,270
Nice.

464
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,640
That's what I like to see.

465
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,030
It was a good game,mike.

466
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,140
Thanks for keeping it
together,you know,until--

467
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,980
until what? Until your blonde
walks in and turns you around?

468
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,060
Who is she?

469
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,480
Uh,she's-- she's
my good-luck charm.

470
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,780
Hey,hold on a second.

471
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,980
Hey,wait up.

472
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,140
What do you want from me,ray?

473
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,320
Look she paid me to come here.

474
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,140
I tried to make her book through
you,but-- what are you doing here,anyway?

475
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,980
I-I thought you didn't like sports.

476
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,580
You told her where you work.

477
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,750
You told her what you do.

478
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,970
You told her who you are.

479
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,730
You let her into your life.

480
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,840
Are you crazy?

481
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,370
We could go to jail for this.

482
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,840
Relax.

483
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,020
I trust her.

484
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:48,890
You tr-- you
trust her.

485
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,820
Hey,coach.

486
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,390
