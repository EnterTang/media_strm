4
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,150
Hey,jemma.It's me again.

5
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,380
Boats leave every 20 minutes so no sweat.

6
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,070
all right.

7
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,720
Jemma,hey.

8
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,020
Hello.

9
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,500
The boat ride,ray.

10
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,240
I can barely hear you.

11
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,640
Um,hold oN.

12
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,570
Hello?

13
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,610
Hold on.

14
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,390
Okay,can you hear me now?

15
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,910
Hello?Jemma?

16
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,410
Did hear anything I said?

17
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,440
Are you here somewhere?

18
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,350
No,I'm at home.

19
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,170
what,did you get sick?

20
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,410
I'm fine.It's just now I have to say it all again.

21
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,990
I'm not saying it's you.

22
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,440
Maybe,it's my fault.

23
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,170
Maybe it's-- maybe it's nobody's fault.

24
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,160
What are you talking about?

25
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,330
The boat ride,ray.

26
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,380
I don't know if I'm going to make it.

27
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,590
Forget about the boat ride.

28
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,360
We'll do something else.

29
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,760
It's not just about the boat.

30
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,950
Why don't I come over there and we'll talk about it?

31
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,430
I don't want you to come over.

32
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,950
Okay.

33
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,640
Is this because I brought up the money?

34
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,650
I think we need a break,ray.

35
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,300
I'll call you later,okay?

36
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,600
ray's voice: I said no to jessica so I could say yes to jemma.

37
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,790
- Ray. - Am I too late?

38
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,180
No,I just thought you had plans with the new blonde.

39
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,410
I had the wrong weekend.

40
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,280
It's next weekend.

41
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,310
Ray's voice: But when jemma said no to me,dinner with my family sounded pretty good.

42
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,130
I'd forgotten,lotte,how much you like to chew on those chicken bones.

43
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,540
Good for health.

44
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,610
Well,all delicious.

45
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,790
Jess,top-notch.

46
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,910
Special food for a special family.

47
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,940
Lotte: Lazy family.

48
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,070
Ronnie is very lazy.

49
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,210
That's not true.

50
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,590
- Is true.
- Not true.

51
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,630
- Is true.
-Ronnie is right here.

52
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,570
There's no need to speak about him in the third person.

53
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,310
See,ronnie wasn't on the barbecue because he was busy working in his office

54
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,700
because he keeps finding his papers out of order on his desk.

55
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,100
Maybe natasha keeps messing them up.

56
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,040
Lotte: In marriage,everything 50-50.

57
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,720
No secrets.

58
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,860
What would you know about marriage?

59
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,490
You've been divorced for 30 years.

60
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,620
may I have the potatoes,please?

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,990
Is he lisping?

62
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,580
Did you...

63
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,500
pierce your tongue?

64
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,500
No,it's a prosthetic.

65
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,220
What did he say?

66
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,220
He said it's a prosthetic.

67
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,950
-It's a joke.
-It is a form of self-expression.

68
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,720
It's fine.I looked it up on the internet today.

69
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,090
Not if it gets infected.

70
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,510
Oh,just leave it right there when you're done.

71
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,420
- Did you need anything else?
- Nope.

72
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,180
You know,I'm not doing this because she told me to.

73
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,240
I'm doing this because I choose to.

74
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,520
I didn't say anything,ron.

75
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,680
You know,I'm not in the doghouse,ray.

76
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,040
I'm in my house.

77
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,320
Not my parent's old house,not a tent,

78
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,500
but my home that I bought with my very own grownup money.

79
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,270
So I'll do the dishes if I please.

80
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,200
Is that why...

81
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,060
you think you got her?

82
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,910
What are you talking about?

83
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,940
My wife.

84
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,900
My ex-wife.

85
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,770
You think that's why she left me for you?

86
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,810
'Cause of the money?

87
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,510
What kind of douchebag are you?

88
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,970
I didn't mean anything by it,ron.

89
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,820
I just,uh...

90
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,830
how did you get the girl?

91
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,410
How did a guy like you get the girl from a guy like me?

92
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,890
Why don't you go home,ray?

93
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,550
I'm not trying to pick a fight,ron.

94
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,520
You've got to admit it's a little unusual,that's all.

95
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,750
Get out of my house.

96
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,130
Ronnie,what's going on?

97
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:53,990
Nothing.

98
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,040
Ray.

99
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,780
Just leaving.

100
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,050
Bye.

101
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,040
What did he say?

102
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,160
looks like you've been here for hours.

103
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,270
Want to play a little one-on-one?

104
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,730
I'm uncoordinated,ray.

105
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,320
Isn't there someone else you can play with?

106
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,530
Like who?

107
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,490
I know a lot of guys.

108
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,230
They don't hang around with other guys that much.

109
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,240
Why not?

110
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,920
I just spent half my life married with kids.

111
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,570
I don't see you loaded up with friends either.

112
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,520
So what,you called me here to play basketball?

113
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,300
No,I need some...

114
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,190
women advice.

115
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,680
What kind of women advice?

116
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,590
Just general.

117
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,240
Okay,it's jemma.

118
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,880
You are unbelievable!

119
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,040
You have some fucking nerve!

120
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,910
god.

121
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,520
god.

122
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,370
All right.

123
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,820
What did she do?

124
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,100
She'S...

125
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,410
beg weird.

126
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,210
I can't figure it out.

127
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,800
Ray,I have no ideas about that whatsoever.

128
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,070
All right,you know what?

129
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,840
This is going in "the detroit examiner.

130
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,780
This.

131
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,760
Another smiley face?

132
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,750
Yeah,except this one has a phone number,okay?

133
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,700
You were right.

134
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,780
No more subliminal advertising.But,ray,

135
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,850
we have to decide,are we gonna run this ad or are we gonna rip it up?

136
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,230
Why would we rip it up?

137
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,880
I am clawing my way through this writer's block.

138
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,990
I'm probably in a positive relationship.

139
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,630
And I would like to be taken seriously.

140
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,420
- I take you seriously. - No you don'T.

141
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,920
No you don'T.

142
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,800
Ray,I put a lot of effort into being your pimp.

143
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,940
And I just feel like if you can't respect my part of running this business,

144
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,170
then I'm just gonna go back to making lyric bread.

145
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,280
So are you ready to work your ass off and be part of my winning team?

146
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,290
happiness consultants.May I help you?

147
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,700
Woman: Hi,could you tell me more about what it is you do?

148
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,510
oh,sure.

149
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:14,390
Well,this is probably fodder for a longer conversation,but in a word we,um...

150
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,220
we have a service to make women like yourself...

151
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,120
feel better.

152
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,600
More happy,if you will.

153
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,490
Could you explain further,please?

154
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,690
Well,it's delicate.Perhaps we should meet in person.

155
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:34,920
Why should iake the time to meet you when I don't even know what you're selling,t-brain?

156
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,830
Did you just say t-brain?

157
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,300
Yeah,I did.

158
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,950
Lenore,what are you doing calling my ad?

159
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,040
I was curious.

160
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,110
Now I know.F.Y.I.,Your pitch needs work.

161
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,330
What?

162
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,040
I didn't ask you,lenore.

163
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:47,840
Well,it's weird.

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,160
Why would you put a sex ad in the lifestyles section when it should be with the sex ads?

165
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,980
I don't think the sex ads are classy.

166
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,620
Look,t-brain,this is your problem.

167
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,810
You overthink.

168
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,440
If people want sex,they'll look in the sex ads.

169
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,500
-It's pimp 101. -Lenore,

170
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,720
I have a complex marketing strategy.

171
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,730
Fuck your marketing strategy.

172
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,360
You're a beginner.Recruit people you know.

173
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,880
I already do that.

174
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,270
No you don't or I would've heard about it.

175
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,690
What about horny patty,for example?

176
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,540
You could sign her ass up in a heartbeat.

177
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,430
Who?

178
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,270
Horny patty.Wagner & finch.

179
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,180
You mean patty the proofreader?

180
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,680
Yeah,she's the horniest woman I've ever met.

181
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,730
Doing it right there at her desk.

182
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:34,320
tanya: No,she was not,lenore.She was concentrating.

183
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,670
Lenore: Yeah,concentrating on getting fucked.

184
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,290
Listen,t-brain,even losers need to get laid once in a while.

185
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,900
You'd be doing her a favor.

186
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,990
I see her in the mall all the time and she still looks so horny.

187
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,690
What does that mean,lenore?

188
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,610
"Looks so horny.

189
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,170
" You know,I hate the way you talk.

190
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,540
You're so judgmental.

191
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,300
Lenore,why don't you focus on your business and I will focus on mine?

192
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,550
Dear jemma.

193
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,290
Ray!

194
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,790
What are you doing here?

195
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,910
Are the kids okay?

196
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,690
If you think that I married ron for the money

197
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,580
and would've stayed with you even if you had any fucking money,

198
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,900
you are out of your fucking mind!

199
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,460
All I did was ask for his advice.

200
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,250
It had nothing to do with you.

201
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,370
I chose him,ray.

202
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,620
I chose him over you.

203
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,880
Just keep your voice down,all right?

204
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,850
I've got neighbors.

205
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,920
What are you so mad about?

206
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,440
What,because I talked to him?

207
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,270
You are putting ideas into his head.

208
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,910
You're trying to sabotage my marriage.

209
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,640
I just wanted to know how he got you.

210
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,130
The idea to ask him just popped into my head.

211
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,360
Okay.

212
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:52,730
Next time something pops into your head,ask me,ray.

213
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,220
I divorced a boy to marry a man.

214
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,200
Tanya: Do you remember lenore,patty?

215
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,300
Yeah.

216
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,420
She's kind of a bitch.

217
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,590
Yeah,probably,but...

218
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:29,380
you know,she had this talent for figuring out what people want and how to give it to them.

219
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,370
What do you mean?

220
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,600
Well...

221
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,120
it's kind of secret.

222
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:46,150
It's really not appropriate for the workplace,but I'll share.

223
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,410
Lenore has a service...

224
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,550
um,for women who feel alone...

225
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,680
to help them feel...

226
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,250
less...

227
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,200
alone.

228
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,330
What are you talking about?

229
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:11,300
It's a service for women.

230
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,990
- Here you go. - Thank you.

231
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,090
You ready?

232
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:28,410
There are times when I find myself fighting these urges that rise in me

233
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,020
and I desperately want a man.

234
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,180
This service helps satisfy that urge.

235
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,180
I know,it sounds shocking.

236
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,210
But you wouldn't believe how good it is.

237
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,720
Are you saying that you've tried it?

238
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,760
I shouldn't say.

239
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,280
We're work colleagues after all.

240
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,040
twice.

241
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,030
I went to seaworld in florida last month by myself.

242
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,290
It was a lot of fun.

243
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,050
I had a free weekend,so I treated myself.

244
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,260
Flew jet blue.

245
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,980
That sounds nice.

246
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,150
No it doesn'T.

247
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,020
It sounds pathetic and lame.

248
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,310
But that's,you know,that's what I like.

249
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,400
I like zoos and seaworld.

250
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,350
I'm into animals.

251
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,710
I love animal stories,you know,and...

252
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,270
you ever watch those old "wild kingdom" videos on youtube?

253
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,450
I love 'em.

254
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,430
They're so... you know,'cause they're so unintentionally hilarious.

255
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,960
Plus the animals are so great.

256
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,170
You know what else I love?

257
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,720
This.

258
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,760
What?

259
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,340
I love that normally that I come home from dates and I'm,

260
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,180
you know,I feel so... I just... I'm so uptight and

261
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,170
I feel like I said the wrong thing or that I looked like an idiot.

262
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,570
But now I'm totally relaxed.

263
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,870
Cause even if I sound like a birdbrain,you're gonna lie and you're gonna say it's fine.

264
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,310
Right?

265
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,920
Aren't you gonna lie and say it's fine?

266
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,400
Kinda.

267
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,090
it's fantastic.

268
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,300
- I'm having a good time.
- Good.

269
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,610
Let's fuck.

270
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,750
That's something else I never say.

271
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,830
God,it sounds so great.

272
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,370
Shit,you can say it again if you want to.

273
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,420
Okay,let's fuck.

274
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:12,400
Let's fuck......

275
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,700
You wanna?

276
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,030
Screwing patty was easy.

277
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,370
Fucking isn't hard.

278
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,290
It's the mind-fucking you've to to watch out for.

279
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,380
She came,and then it came to me.

280
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,980
I had to be completely honest.

281
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,160
I had to say everything.

282
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,680
Jemma.

283
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,310
What are you doing here?

284
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,670
I wanted to see you.

285
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,900
- Well,I'm working.
- I know.

286
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,950
I just wanted to give you this.

287
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,720
It's a letter.

288
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,690
It's from my heart.

289
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,420
Fuck your heart.

290
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,700
- What?  - Fuck your heart.

291
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,090
I don't understand.

292
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,360
What don't you understand,ray? I said fuck your heart.

293
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,860
I paid in full.

294
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,970
Paid in full.

295
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,420
Don't call me again.

296
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,340
Jemma.

297
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,030
Hey hey hey,wait.

298
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,810
Why are you doing this?

299
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,740
I thought you said you wanted to think about it.

300
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,030
Well,I've thought about it.

301
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,940
Jemma,we had something.

302
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,170
Listen,in the tent,in your eyes I know what I saw.

303
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,740
What do you see now,ray?

304
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,050
In my eyes,what do you see now?

305
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,620
Please.

306
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,770
I've got to go.

307
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,960
Hey hey,you know what?

308
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,060
You will never know what's in my heart.

309
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,540
Come here,I want to show you something.

310
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,720
Hey,do you have any red bull?

311
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,300
I can't keep my eyes open.

312
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,660
I don't have any red bull,but I do know how to get you up.

313
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,580
Do you realize that you literally only have vegetables in here?

314
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,180
Well,that's because I'm trying to be a vegetarian.

315
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,070
I was a vegetarian once.

316
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:51,000
And then I realized that if fish was good enough for jesus it's good enough for pierce.

317
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,650
What did you want to show me?

318
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,850
I wanted...my bed.

319
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:05,200
I can tell it's you by the touch of your hair.

320
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm gonna think about that all the way home.

321
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,190
You're not sleeping here tonight?

322
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,770
I...I can'T.

323
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,930
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,350
I told my dad that I'd wake up early and help him patch his driveway.

325
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,700
Pierce,this is weird.

326
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,730
I know next to nothing about you.

327
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:33,910
Listen,tomorrow,you ask me whatever you want,okay?

328
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,490
Hey,man.

329
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,220
Hey!

330
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,450
Didn't you used to be ray drecker?

331
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,880
I'm back in town,man.

332
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,300
It's cliff.

333
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,170
I fucking hate you,drecker.

334
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,400
I've been hating you since 1981.

335
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,370
Me too.

336
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,050
Tonight's not your night,drecker.

337
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,850
It's my night.

338
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,690
My night,asshole.

339
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,070
Yeah,tonight I get my revenge.

340
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,960
Fuck you!

Contact.

342
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,010
You were a freshman.

343
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,700
I was a senior.

344
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,630
You're not supposed to hit a home run off me.

345
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,600
Fuck you.

346
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,480
Contact.

347
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:17,050
It was the bottom of the last inning,up two,two on,two outs.

348
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,510
Fuck you.

349
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,600
Contact.

350
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,140
you know,I should've walked you,but I wanted to strike your ass out.

351
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,980
I should've thrown a ball at your fucking head.

352
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,760
Fuck you!

353
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,230
Contact.

354
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:54,600
I loved you,man,in a fucked up kind of a way.

355
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,350
I followed you.

356
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,150
I followed every game you ever played.

357
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,740
Fuck you.

358
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,410
Contact.

359
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,480
I came inside because I didn't want to wait in the rain.

360
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,360
Ray...

361
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,240
I'm sorry about jemma.

362
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,130
She wanted to hurt you and she was willing to pay for it.

363
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,190
I didn't know until tonight.

364
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,110
I swear on my mother's lack of love I had no idea.

365
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,040
I didn't know until she paid me.

366
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,210
She said it wasn't about you.

367
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,250
She wanted to break up with someone who cared,

368
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:29,560
the way that it had always been done to her...with no explanation,no warning.

369
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,820
She actually said you made her happy.

370
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,910
how much did she pay you?

371
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,910
2,000.

372
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,730
Put the money on the table.

373
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,710
Ray,I never liked her.

374
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,490
I could...I could smell it.

375
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,690
It just... she... you deserve better.

376
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,060
Believe me.

377
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,920
You want to have a beer with me?

378
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,250
you're the only friend I've got. You know that?

379
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,320
No,ray. Wait.

380
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,740
No,we've got to get you out of these wet clothes.

381
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,500
Come here.Come here.Come on get up.

382
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,920
Get up.

383
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,070
Really,it's freezing.

384
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,000
Here,just put... put...put your arms up.

385
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,440
Okay.

386
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,200
Do you have any clean clothes?

387
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,320
Where are... where are your clean clothes?

388
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,160
Here.

389
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,800
Put... okay,here.

390
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,320
Put this on.

391
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,710
Put your arms up.

392
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,430
Arms up.

393
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,370
Here you go.

394
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,930
Okay... stop it.

395
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,340
Ray.

396
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,660
No,lie down.

397
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,480
Why do men only want to sleep with me when they're drunk?

398
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,780
Here,scoot.

399
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,010
Come on.Scoot in.

400
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,030
Okay.

401
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,520
There,is that good?

402
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,270
Can I ask you something,ray?

403
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:33,760
How come you never called me after that first night?

404
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,040
I mean,other than you think that I come too much.

405
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,560
I think you come perfect.

406
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,600
I...

407
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,870
I think you come just right.

408
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,880
Thanks.

409
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,310
Good night,ray.
