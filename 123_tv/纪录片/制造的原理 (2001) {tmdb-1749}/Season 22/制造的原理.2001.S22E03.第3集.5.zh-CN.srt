1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,210
他们所做的事...
what they're doing...

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,990
非常危险
it's dangerous.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,560
我求你...
I'm begging you, please...

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,460
一定要阻止他们
you've got to stop them.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,210
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,870
轻点
Quiet.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:22,790
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,600
快来 跟着我
Come on, follow me.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,880
我们不该上去
We're not supposed to go up there.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,390
我们得为圣餐仪式好好练习
We're supposed to be practicing for communion.

11
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,310
谁在乎圣餐?
Who cares about communion?

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,560
我知道Brooks神父藏酒的地方
I know where father brooks keeps the wine.

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,010
嘿 你去哪儿?
Hey, where you going?

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,860
受害者砸碎彩色玻璃窗掉了下来
Our vic crashed through a stained glass window.

15
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,730
谁报的警?
Who called it in?

16
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,930
Brooks神父
Father brooks.

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,520
他还惊魂未定
Little shaken up.

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,870
像是个堕落天使
Fallen angel thing.

19
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,030
死者身上没有身份证明
Still no id on the vic.

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,820
可能是米迦勒或加百列
(两人都是圣经中提到过的大天使)
Could be a michael or gabriel.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,610
人们说曼哈顿生活艰难
They say it's tough to make it in manhattan.

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,870
天堂一定是个残酷的地方
Heaven must be brutal.

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,400
是啊
Yeah.

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,190
我们还在查失踪人口...
We're still checking missing persons...

25
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,390
和诺斯卑达穆斯(法国星相学家)
and nostradamus.

26
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,250
没有别的目击者?
No other witnesses?

27
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,950
没有
Nope.

28
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,560
制服警员仔细检查了周围地区
没有发现
Unis canvassed the surrounding area and got nothing.

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,100
昨晚警区确实接到了一连串电话
The two-seven did receive a bunch of calls last night.

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,520
举报非法闯入
Reports of a possible b&E.

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,170
另外他们觉得听到了玻璃破碎声
但不确定具体位置
Also, they thought they heard glass breaking, but no particular location.

32
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,340
那其他大楼的外部监视器呢?
What about the external security cameras from other buildings?

33
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,000
拍到屋顶的几部显示上面没人
然后一个戴着巨大翅膀的家伙从天而降
Couple of them show the roof of the church with no one on it, and a guy with big wings falls out of the sky.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,300
我查过了 当时这一带并没有活动
也没有公开的特技表演
I checked, there were no scheduled events in the area, no publicity stunts.

35
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,130
给空管中心打过电话
也没有飞行记录
Called air traffic control, no reports of flyovers.

36
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,310
这家伙真是诡异
This one's just weird.

37
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,740
如果他不是
从降落伞或飞行器上掉下来...
If he didn't fall from some type of parachute or aircraft...

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,720
天堂总是有的
there's always heaven.

41
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,250
运走尸体前
Brooks神父想念段祷文
father brooks would like to say a prayer before we move the body.

42
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,750
没问题
Sure.

43
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,170
我马上好了
I'm almost done here.

44
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,020
铁索
Carabiner.

45
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,490
这孩子身上一定还绑过东西
Kid must've been attached to something.

46
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,860
钩子 挽具 翅膀
Hook, harness, wings.

47
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,600
这算是什么? 实习天使?
What are we looking at, some kind of angel in training?

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,150
也许他飞过了头 掉下来了
Maybe he overshot a landing and fell.

49
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,440
不管他在干什么
Whatever he was doing...

50
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,590
我觉得他并非意外
I don't think he fell by accident.

51
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,540
绳索是切割过的
This cord's been cut.

52
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,210
整个切口几乎都很整齐
Clean cut's almost all the way through.

53
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,270
蓄意破坏
Sabotage.

54
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,990
没错
Right.

55
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,720
绳索被割后承重能力变弱
加上他的体重造成其全部断裂
The cords were weakened by the cut, and the weight of his body did the rest.

56
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,360
他所剩下的就只有一副翅膀
和一段祷文
All he had left were wings and a prayer.

57
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,530
嘿 Sid
Hey, sid.

58
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,680
Mac派我来的
Mac sent me up here.

59
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,750
听说你复原了一些 嗯…
Said you recovered some, uh...

60
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,920
证据?
whoa, evidence?

61
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,950
是啊
Yeah.

62
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,930
看来年轻的伊卡罗斯(希腊神话中的人物)
飞得离科技天堂太近了
It seems young icarus flew too close to tech heaven.

63
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,780
那个是微型摄影机吗?
Is that a micro video camera?

64
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,490
是的
Yep.

65
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,400
我发现这东西嵌在他的胸口
I found it embedded in his chest.

66
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,620
我认为它原先应该绑在背带的前方
I believe it may have been attached to the front of his harness.

67
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,710
看到了么?
See?

68
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,740
打扰一下 给你
Excuse me.Here you go.

69
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,730
哦 谢谢 Rashida
Oh, thanks, rashida.

70
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,930
不客气
You're welcome.

71
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,160
年轻的伊卡罗斯现在有了新名字
Young icarus now has an alias.

72
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,030
Toby Finch 18岁
Toby finch, 18.

73
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,880
血液中酒精浓度相当高
Blood-alcohol level was quite high.

74
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,660
听起来象是一些小鬼的疯狂表演出了岔子
Sounds like some crazy kid stunt gone wrong.

75
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,690
哦 是啊
Oh, yeah.

76
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,460
一定很恐怖 径直坠落
看着地面越来越近却无力阻止
Must've been horrible, falling, not being able to stop, seeing the ground get closer and closer.

77
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,510
从天堂堕落并非致死原因
His fall from grace didn't kill him.

78
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,810
那死因是什么?
What was cod?

79
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,540
枕骨寰椎分离
Occipito atlantal separation.

80
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,730
他脊柱有两处受到重创
His spine was severed in two places.

81
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,570
撞击地面之前就已经死了
He was dead before he hit the ground.

82
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,030
Sinclair主任
地方检察官为何不起诉Taylor警探?
chief sinclair, why isn't the D.A.Filing charges against detective taylor?

83
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,320
地方检查官对他涉嫌
Clay Dobson一案的调查已经结束
The district attorney's investigation of his involvement with clay dobson was thorough.

84
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,150
没有足够证据以刑事案件起诉
There was not enough evidence to move forward with a criminal case.

85
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,230
一名戴着手铐的犯人从屋顶上坠落
A handcuffed prisoner fell from a rooftop.

86
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,100
Taylor和Dobson曾有宿怨是真的吗?
Isn't it true taylor had a vendetta against dobson?

87
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,310
"宿怨"是个强烈的字眼
"Vendetta" is a strong word.

88
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,310
"追求正义的激情"比较准确
"Passion for justice" is a bit more accurate.

89
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,320
不要忘了Dobson谋杀了至少两名女性
Let's not forget that dobson murdered at least two women.

90
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,970
而Mac Taylor 是一名评价很高的警探
And mac taylor is a highly decorated detective.

91
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,390
这是六个月以来
纽约警察局涉嫌的第三起死亡
This is the third death in the last six months at the hands of the nypd.

92
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,590
你和你的部门怎么能继续忽视这一点?
How can you and the department continue to ignore it? 

93
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,190
Sinclair主任 你认为是
Taylor故意让Dobson坠下屋顶的吗?
chief sinclair, do you think taylor let dobson fall off that rooftop?

94
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,300
只有Taylor警探和Clay Dobson
才知道事情的来龙去脉
Only detective taylor and clay dobson know exactly what happened.

95
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,200
但我想向全体市民保证
答案会很快水落石出
But I want to assure the people of this city, the answers are forthcoming.

96
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,270
我会尽一切力量去追查真相
And I will exhaust all the resources of my office to find the truth.

97
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,420
主任 我们什么时候才能知道答案?
Chief, when can we expect those answers?

98
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,880
Gerrard督察 你还有什么别的要说的吗?
Inspector gerrard, do you have anything more to say about this?

99
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,420
我想我们说的已经够多了
We've said enough, I think.

100
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,340
Taylor探长?
Detective taylor?

101
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,410
我是Scotty Valens
Scotty valens.

102
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,900
费城凶杀组
Philadelphia homicide.

103
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,450
我收到你的留言
I got your message.

104
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,800
有关我们的实验室在CODIS中的记录
Something about a codis hit to our lab.

105
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,730
是啊 FBI发现了这个记录
而后移交给了费城警察局
Yeah, the fbi flagged the hit and kicked it down to philly pd.

106
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,680
他们发现这和我们的一个案子有关
They found a connect to one of our jobs.

107
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,300
是10年前一件未被侦破的谋杀案
A ten-year-old murder never solved.

108
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,710
CODIS中的记录
符合你们实验室里的一名女性
The codis hit to your lab was from a female.

109
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,550
我不明白
I don't understand.

110
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,470
我的DNA怎么会跑的CODIS里去的?
How did my dna end up in codis?

111
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,340
Adam做PCR测试
检查你是否感染HIV时录入的
It happened when adam conducted the pcr test to determine your hiv status.

112
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:23,420
但在进行PCR测试前
我记得把二次取样放在台子上的
But before I ran the pcr test, I remember setting the secondary sample down on the counter.

113
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,240
我不知道 也许是实验室技术人员...
I don't know, maybe, like, a lab tech...

114
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,950
意外收起来的
accidentally picked it up.

115
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,150
解释了费城凶杀组
在CODIS找到吻合记录的原因
Which explains why philly homicide got a hit in codis.

116
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,480
凶杀组?
Homicide?

117
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,940
Stella 一件谋杀案的证据上
找到了你的DNA
Stella, your dna was found on evidence connected with a murder.

118
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,520
那不可能
That's impossible.

119
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,750
这件外套看起来眼熟吗?
Does this coat look familiar?

120
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,000
不
No.

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,950
想象它没那么脏 干净一点
Picture it less dirty, faded.

122
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,110
之前从没见过 警探
I've never seen the coat before, detective.

123
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,610
我们在现场找到一条裙子
There's a blouse we found at the scene.

124
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,780
我们真的要这样一张张来
让你分析我眼睛的变化吗?
Are we really gonna do this one picture at a time while you analyze every shifty eye move?

125
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,730
没错
Yeah.

126
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,320
我们就是要这么干
That's really how we're gonna do it.

127
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,190
就让我看一下案卷吧
Just let me take a look at the case file.

128
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,260
你也许是名警探 但同时也是嫌犯
You may be a detective, but you're also a suspect.

129
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,090
我是个能帮上你忙的警察
I'm a cop who can help you.

130
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,560
你的部门在找上我以前已经走进了死胡同
Your department has been at a dead end until you got to me.

131
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,900
你发现证据的时候我并不在费城
我在纽约上警察学院
I wasn't in philly when you found your evidence, I was here in new york attending the police academy.

132
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,720
那么何不利用我们法医实验室的资源呢?
So what do you say we use the resources of our forensic lab?

133
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,710
让别的人看看这案子 看看是否
有与此证据相关的联系--有关纽约的联系
Bring on some fresh eyes, see if there's a connection-- a new york connection-- to this evidence.

134
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,370
我们认为一名年轻女子死了
We think a young woman is dead.

135
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,350
97年3月
March '97.

136
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,030
工人在土里发现了血衣和小刀
Workers found the bloody clothes and knife buried in the dirt.

137
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,040
衣服是在朝费城方向的
费城高速公路的南面找到的
The clothes were on the south side of the philadelphia turnpike headed towards philly.

138
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,760
没有目击者 没有失踪人口报告 只有这件证据
No witnesses, no missing persons report filed, just this evidence.

139
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,460
刀上没有指纹 但衬衣上有三处切口
No prints on the knife, but the blouse had three cuts in it.

140
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,780
衣服上的血大部分是女性的
Most of the blood on the clothes was female.

141
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,830
但也有一些男性的DNA
But there was some male dna.

142
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,240
当然 我们也发现了你的血迹
Of course, we found traces of your blood as well.

143
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,980
上面说衬衣的袖口上粘有显影药水
Now it says here that the blouse had photo developing chemicals on the cuffs.

144
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,960
是的 我们认为死者可能是个摄影师
Yeah, we think the victim may have been a photographer.

145
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,570
外套上有氯丁二烯橡胶
凡士林和荧光白油漆
Traces of neoprene and vaseline, iridescent white paint were found on the coat.

146
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,310
那有很多不同的用途
It has a lot of different uses.

147
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,060
让我看看化学物质报告
Let me see this chemical report.

148
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,860
氯丁二烯橡胶 凡士林和荧光油漆
So iridescent paint, vaseline and neoprene.

149
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,000
是橡胶 对吗?
It's rubber, right?

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,930
你在想什么?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.What are you thinking?

151
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,460
十年前 这三种物质
在曼哈顿某处占重要地位
Well, ten years ago, all three of these materials were featured prominently in one place in manhattan.

152
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,090
"街道博物馆"里的一件艺术品
A piece of art at the museo del barrio.

153
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,130
你当时在那?
You were there?

154
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,080
不 不 我只是记得在报纸上看过
No, no, I just remember reading about it in the paper.

155
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,550
你说这名死者是摄影师
You said that your vic was a photographer.

156
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,400
也许是她在拍照的时候靠在了那上面
蹭到了这些物质
Maybe she brushed up or leaned against it and picked up the trace while she was taking photos.

157
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,280
好吧 我去给报社打个电话
看他们的存档里有没有线索
All right, I'm gonna put a call into the newspapers, see if they have anything in their archives.

158
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,450
谢谢 Danny
Thanks, danny.

159
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,930
知道吗 我们应该查查纽约的失踪人口
You know, we should check new york's missing persons, 

160
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,620
看看有没有和博物馆有关的人失踪了
see if there's anyone associated with the museum who may have gone missing.

161
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,080
我们?
We?

162
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,130
我可没在找搭档啊
I ain't looking for a partner here.

163
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,530
想想看 我可是你唯一的线索
Well, consider me your only lead.

164
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,940
嘿 Mac 我检查了
背带上蹦极绳的剩余部分
Hey, mac, I took a look at the remnants of the bungee cords that were on the harness.

165
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,460
切口是由复合刀刃造成的
The cuts were made by a combo edge blade.

166
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,460
大多数随身小折刀都是这样
Standard in most pocket knives.

167
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,850
那可能是这个阴谋的来源
That may be our source of sabotage.

168
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,410
绳子上的指纹呢?
Any luck with prints on the cord?

169
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,470
还在处理 另外在等
从他凉鞋底上采取的物质的报告
Still working on that and waiting on trace I collected from the soles of his sandals.

170
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,820
我从受害者翅膀上的发射器里
恢复了部分图像
Hey, I recovered partial images from a transmitter I found in the vic's wings.

171
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,230
有些东西你得看看
There's something you should see.

172
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,670
阻止你的朋友们
Stop your friends.

173
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,970
我们正在死去 但没人来阻止这一切
因为没人在乎
We're dying, and no one's going to stop us because no one cares.

174
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,180
这可不是Toby
This isn't toby.

175
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,230
是啊 但这是这整个故事的开始
Yeah, but this is the beginning of the whole story.

176
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,230
<i>我要成为下一个互联网百万富翁超胆侠!</i>
I want to be the next $100,000 internet daredevil!

177
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,120
这是同一个女孩吗?
Is this the same girl?

178
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,230
没错 这是Jessica
Yeah, this is jessica.

179
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,570
<i>来吧 把它点上!</i>
Here we go, light it up!

180
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,300
她就是这样被毁容的
Here's how she became disfigured.

181
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,840
<i>等等 哇 哇 哇!</i>
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!

182
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,820
她放下酒杯的时候
一些酒撒到了衣服上 着了火
When she downed the shot, she spilled some of the alcohol on her coat, and it caught fire.

183
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,470
你从哪找到的?
where'd you find this?

184
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,580
一个叫"互联网超胆侠"的网站
On a website called internetdaredevil.Com.

185
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,460
他们正在比赛
录下最疯狂大胆的表演
They're running a contest to see who can get the craziest stunt recorded on video.

186
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:14,880
现在你要看到的就是Toby的翅膀上的
发射器记忆卡里被我恢复的东西
Now, what you're about to see is from the memory card I recovered on the transmitter in toby's wings.

187
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,340
我要成为下一个互联网百万富翁超胆侠!
I want to be the next $100,000 internet daredevil!

188
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,270
他喝醉了 试图完成一些疯狂表演
He was drunk, trying to pull off some crazy stunt.

189
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,940
这表明Toby是从某处起飞
最后掉进了教堂
It appears toby was launched from somewhere and ended up at the church.

190
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,400
分析一下录像
Analyze the video.

191
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,340
地表 飞行速度 气温--
看看能否找到他的起始点
Landmarks, run velocity, air temp-- see if you can find his starting poinT.

192
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,500
网页呢?
What about this website?

193
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,580
它激励孩子们伤害自己
It's encouraging kids to hurt themselves.

194
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,850
肯定不合法
That can't be legal.

195
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,580
比赛可不是犯罪
Well, contests aren't a crime.

196
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,700
愚蠢和缺乏判断力也不是
Neither is stupidity or bad judgment.

197
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,000
在Toby的案子中
我们有证据表明有人割了蹦极绳
In toby's case, we have evidence someone cut the bungee cord.

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,260
也许那人不希望他赢得大奖
Maybe that someone didn't want him to win the grand prize.

199
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,840
Danny 你有什么发现?
Danny, what do you got?

200
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,740
发现一张1997年3月30日照片
登在 "街道博物馆"的"悲伤之墙"上
Found a photo expos?on the "sorrowful wall" from the museo del barrio march 30, 1997.

201
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,530
血衣被发现后的一天
The day after the bloody clothes were found.

202
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,070
照片是一个叫Erin Yates的人拍的
Photo byline was an erin yates.

203
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,480
还有这个--把胶卷交给展览会之后
他们就再也没有她的消息了
And get this-- after she handed in the film on the exhibit, paper never heard from her again.

204
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,920
她可能是那个受害人吗?
Could she be your vic?

205
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,110
有可能
Could be.

206
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,390
编辑把她留下的东西送了来
The editor sent over her box of belongings that she left behind.

207
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,150
被水泡过
There's water damage.

208
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,550
地下室水管爆裂造成的
Something about a pipe busting in the basement.

209
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,540
媒体通行证
Press pass.

210
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,280
不认识她
Don't know her.

211
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,260
发现若干胶卷
最后一卷标着1997年3月27日
Found a bunch of rolls of film and the last one dated is march 27, 1997, 

212
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,440
也就是你们发现血衣的两天前
which is two days before you found the bloody clothes.

213
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,390
不知道她为什么没把胶卷洗出来
I wonder why she never developed the film.

214
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,960
也许Erin拍了不该拍的东西
Maybe erin took photographs of something she shouldn't have.

215
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,380
都是同一个人么?
These all the same guy?

216
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,490
看起来好像是
Looks like it.

217
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,740
可是没法看到脸部的清晰图像
Can't get a clear image of the face, though.

218
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,780
底片被水严重损坏
The negatives were severely damaged from the water.

219
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,970
不管这个人是谁
看起来Erin Yates当时在监视他
But whoever this guy is, looks like erin yates was watching him.

220
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,240
你是说假扮Erin Yates的那个人
You mean whoever's posing as erin yates.

221
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,660
查了社会保障记录 发现
真正的Erin 15年前就在睡梦中死去了
Ran the social-- turns out the real erin died in her sleep 15 years ago.

222
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,890
那就是说我们的摄影师盗用了她的身份?
So our photographer stole her identity?

223
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,150
她在躲藏什么东西
She's hiding from something.

224
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,830
Stell 你还好吧?
You okay, stell?

225
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,040
哦 不
Uh, no.

226
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,120
我不好
No, I'm not.

227
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,210
那是你 Stella
That's you, stella.

228
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,540
她出现在你的警校毕业典礼上
She was at your academy graduation.

229
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,680
我是说 Erin Yates 或者不管是谁
拍了你的那张照片
I mean, erin yates, or whoever she is, took that picture of you.

230
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,900
你是那卷胶卷上唯一的一个毕业生
And you're the only graduate on that roll of film.

231
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,740
我不认识Erin
也不知道她为什么要拍这些照片
I don't know erin, and I have no idea why she took these pictures.

232
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,940
我在这儿收集的所有线索都指向你
Every dot I connect here leads back to you.

233
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,790
我无法给出你要的答案 Valens警探
I don't have the answers you're looking for, detective valens.

234
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,560
相信我 我真的希望可以
Believe me, I wish I did.

235
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,000
你在隐藏什么 Stella?
What are you hiding, stella?

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,250
没什么
Nothing.

237
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,280
我什么也没隐藏
I'm not hiding anything.

238
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,720
听着 Valens 如果她说不知道
那就是不知道
Look, valens, if she says she doesn't know, she don't know.

239
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,110
我同意让你参与这个案子
因为你是个警察
I agreed to let you work this case 'cause you're a cop.

240
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,650
我一直试图按照你们的方法办事
I've been trying to go along with the way you guys work.

241
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,800
显然 是我错了
Clearly, my mistake.

242
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,910
我几小时后回来
I'll be back in a couple hours.

243
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:27,010
如果你还是不说
我们可能就得按费城的方法办了
If you still ain't talking, maybe we do it my way in philly.

244
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,390
怎么回事啊?
What's going on?

245
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,800
Stella 看着我
Stella, look at me.

246
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,530
你现在有什么头绪?
What's haunting you?

247
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,030
我不知道 Danny 这就是问题所在
I don't know, danny, that's the problem.

248
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,010
我不知道
I don't know.

249
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,860
噢 讨厌 三角数学
Oh, yuck, trigonometry.

250
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,520
是啊 正弦定理
Yeah, the rule of sines.

251
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,340
我们想要找出Toby Finch起飞的确切地址
We are trying to figure out the exact place where toby finch took flight.

252
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,790
从他起飞后所拍摄的影像长度
Video footage from where he was launched.

253
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,440
右边的这栋楼看起来
是Wexler大楼 对吗?
This building on the right looks to be the wexler building, okay?

254
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,160
在左边 Hannaford分部
On the left, hannaford arms.

255
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,650
计算两者之间的距离--得出搜查范围
Calculate the distance between the two-- come up with a search zone.

256
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,460
他是从这块区域的某处起飞的
He was launched somewhere in this area.

257
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,200
那么这样会有 多少?
So that's gotta be, what?

258
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,840
200±50的大楼屋顶需要检查?
200 rooftops plus or minus 50?

259
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:30,860
低于12楼以及
高于15楼的大楼都可以排除
We can eliminate every building shorter than 12 stories, but we can also eliminate every building higher than 15 stories.

260
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,840
是啊
Uh-huh, yeah.

261
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,140
粗略估计还剩下120个可能的屋顶
That leaves us with roughly 120 possible rooftops.

262
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,720
嘿...
Hey...

263
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,570
别看着我们--困难的部分我们都搞定了
Don't look at us-- we did the hard part.

264
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,040
你们三个看上去不是很乐观啊
you three don't look very optimistic.

265
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,960
受害者的起飞地点是个大大的未知数
The victim's launch site is a big unknown.

266
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:58,200
气质联用分析结果显示他的鞋底有石油
和大理石的痕迹 和普通屋顶材料一致
But gcms results from the soles of his shoes indicate traces of oil and marble, consistent with common roofing materials.

267
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:05,110
可是 这可以帮助我们缩小搜寻条件
因为屋顶不都用相同的沥青混合物
However, it could help us narrow our search criteria, because not all rooftops have the same asphalt mixture.

268
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,560
听起来要打很多电话还要跑不少路
Sounds like a lot of phone calls and footwork.

269
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,570
嘿 等一下 Sheldon
Hey, wait a minute, sheldon.

270
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:14,430
如果找到石油 就意味着
房顶最近才铺好 可能还产生热量
If you found oil, it means the roof was recently paved and could still be generating heat.

271
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,410
对
Right.

272
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,650
因为那些石油还是液体
Because the oil was still liquid.

273
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,410
还没有冷却下来
It hadn't cooled.

274
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,400
正确
Right.

275
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,310
在搜查范围内通过测量屋顶温度的差别
我们或许就能找到精确的地址了
We might be able to pinpoint an exact location by measuring the temperature differential of roof surfaces in our search zone.

276
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,280
太棒了
That's great, yeah.

277
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,530
你要怎么做?
How do you do that?

278
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,070
不要再开远了
nothing so far.

279
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,740
我们朝北边看看
Let's head further north.

280
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,100
遵命
Okay, we'll do that.

281
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,820
我们方向向北
We'll go further north.

282
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,500
出发
Here you go.

283
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,790
转向270度...
Coming about at 270...

284
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,460
空中霸王K-E-B-99
呼叫Laguardia塔台 回话
this is skymaster kilo, echo, bravo, 99-er to laguardia tower.Come in.

285
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,140
下面的是什么地方?
What's below us?

286
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,730
那是Chase-Whittly大楼 警探
That's the chase-whittly building, detective.

287
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:07,520
Hawkes 告诉Flack
尽快抵达Chase-Whittly大楼
hawkes, tell flack to get access to the chase-whittly buildinG.A.S.A.P.

288
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,260
可以了
We're good.

289
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,320
收到
Roger that.

290
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,080
有空吗 Mac?
Do you have a minute, mac?

291
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,550
警局要进行内部调查
The police department is going forward with an internal investigation.

292
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:43,760
你是说检察官没证据证实是我把Dobson
推下了大楼 但是纽约警局却不确定?
So you're telling me the D.A.Has no evidence that suggests I tossed dobson off that building, but nypd isn't sure?

293
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,820
事情没那么简单 Mac
It's not as simple as that, mac.

294
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,780
是的 我也没以为简单
No, I don't imagine it is.

295
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,250
这和警局有关
This is about the police department.

296
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,800
你的意思是 你和Sinclair
感受到些许的媒体压力
What you mean is that you and sinclair felt a little media pressure, 

297
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,020
而为了警局
你们不准备为我辩护
and for the sake of the department, you're not going to come to my defense.

298
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,270
我猜想 这事该不会跟私人关系有关吧
I suppose I shouldn't take that personally.

299
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,930
警局需要对市民负责
The department has an obligation to the people of this city.

300
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,990
你以前是很有效率的
You used to walk the beat, stan.

301
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,040
当42大街满是妓女和毒品贩子的时候
你在那巡逻
You patrolled 42nd street when it was nothing but hookers and drug dealers 

302
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:18,070
你和其他不辞辛劳的警察一点一滴
把那里清理干净 变成今天的模样
and little by little you and a dozen other hardworking cops cleaned it up, made it what it is today.

303
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,570
你到底想说什么 Taylor?
What's your point, taylor?

304
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,350
我只是很好奇
Well, I was just wondering.

305
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,150
当你逮捕那些坏蛋
把他们铐起来的时候
When you were making all those arrests, locking up bad guys, 

306
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:31,570
你有没有想过有朝一日你会忙着拍
警长的马屁 不记得怎样才能做个警察?
were you imagining a day when you'd be so busy kissing the chief of detectives' ass you wouldn't remember what it was like to be a cop?

307
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,420
你个狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

308
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,300
你不能这么说我
I don't deserve that.

309
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,220
我在这是因为...
You know, I'm here because...

310
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,640
没必要解释 督察
you don't have to explain it, inspector.

311
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,010
我明白 你只是个傀儡而已
I get it; you're just the puppet.

312
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,560
我会把我的案子交给那个幕后黑手的
I'll take my case to the badge that pulls the strings.

313
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,510
这些是同一人?
These all the same guy?

314
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,710
看上去是
Looks like it.

315
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,870
Valens 怎么了?
Valens, what's up?

316
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,560
是啊 你在哪?
Yeah, where are you at?

317
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,590
好 你知道吗?
All right, well, you know what?

318
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,840
就呆在那 我去找你
Stay right there, 'cause I'm gonna come grab you.

319
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,620
我找到一个地址
I got an address.

320
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,810
那是我的前夫
That's my ex-husband.

321
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,800
Garth
Garth.

322
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,070
真的?
Really?

323
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,090
你能告诉我们上哪儿找他吗?
Well, can you tell us where we can find him?

324
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,160
有些问题要问他
Got some questions for him.

325
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,340
不知道
No.

326
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,100
上次见面是10年前
某天突然没有回家
Saw him last ten years ago; just didn't come home one day.

327
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,640
你提交失踪人口报告了吗?
You file a missing persons' report?

328
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,580
我有想过
但是Garth之前也失踪过几星期
I thought about it, but then garth had gone missing for weeks at a time before.

329
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,930
我只是觉得某天他会屁颠屁颠回来的
I just figured he'd bring his trifling butt back home at some point.

330
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:15,880
你有Garth的东西吗 比如旧剃刀
也许一些毛发或者衣服?
You wouldn't happen to have anything of garth's, like an old razor, maybe a lock of hair or, um, clothes?

331
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,690
没有 他所有的东西我都扔了
No, I got rid of every trace of him.

332
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,460
听着 伙计们 我拥有一个收养家庭
Look, fellas, I run a foster home.

333
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,290
政府会给我一笔钱 就这样
The government gives me a certain amount of money.That's it.

334
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,950
他离开后 留给我们的钱就多点
I mean, with him gone, more for the rest of us.

335
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,140
你认识这个女的吗?
Do you know this woman?

336
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,490
看上去不太眼熟
No, she doesn't look familiar.

337
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,900
这是谁?
Well, who's this?

338
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,790
啊 那是Mindy Mindy Sanchez
Ah, that's mindy, mindy sanchez.

339
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,180
她过去 过去住在这儿
Yeah, she used to, she used to live here.

340
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,090
知道她现在在哪吗?
You know where she is now?

341
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,610
不知道
No clue.

342
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,640
她离家出走了
She ran away.

343
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,820
某天早上起来 她就不见了
Woke up one morning and she was gone.

344
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,260
最后一个问题
You know, one last thing.

345
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,810
你认识一个叫Stella Bonasera的人吗?
Do you know a stella bonasera?

346
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,150
认识
Yeah.

347
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,570
Stella
Stella.

348
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,020
她曾是我收养的孩子
She was one of my foster kids.

349
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,090
大家都忘不了Stella
No one could ever forget stella.

350
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,770
所以我们认为Mindy就是Erin
So we think mindy is erin.

351
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,120
是那个项坠
that's the locket.

352
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,340
这能解释为何
我的DNA会弄到那些衣服上
The locket explains how my dna got on those clothes.

353
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,510
Mindy和我一起发了誓
Mindy and I made a pact.

354
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,410
一辈子都是朋友
Friends forever and ever.

355
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,270
你告诉我你不认识这个姑娘?
You're telling me you didn't recognize this girl?

356
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,720
你的结拜姐妹?
Your blood sister?

357
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,930
那个时候的确没认出来
No, I didn'T.

358
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,220
记者证照片上的项坠也不眼熟吗?
And the locket in the press pass photo didn't look familiar?

359
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,320
噢 拜托 我怎么可能认得出来?
Oh, please, how could I possibly recognize this?

360
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,590
你发了誓
却不记得跟你结拜的那个人?
You make this pact and you don't remember the one item that bonds you together?

361
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,100
Mindy把那个项坠带走了
Mindy took the locket with her.

362
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,990
除了里面的东西 这个项坠
没有任何令人注目或者有特色的地方
There's nothing memorable or distinctive about this locket, except for what's inside of it.

363
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,260
孩子分享秘密 Stella
Kids share secrets, stella.

364
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,190
也许Mindy告诉过你些什么
而你答应帮她保守秘密
Maybe mindy told you something, something you promised to keep quiet.

365
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,730
你要说的是什么 Valens?
What are you getting at, valens?

366
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:53,870
如果那个未知男性DNA是Garth Bennett的
而未知女性是Mindy Sanchez
If garth bennett is our unknown male dna and mindy sanchez is the unknown female, 

367
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,120
你养父要杀你的好友一定是有原因的
there's got to be a reason why your foster dad wanted to kill your best friend.

368
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,800
Sinclair主任
Chief sinclair.

369
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,560
你有10分钟 Mac
You've got ten minutes, mac.

370
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,810
我想要你撤销内部事务调查
I'd like you to drop your internal affairs investigation.

371
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:15,070
一个嫌疑犯从20层的高楼坠下
而当时只有你和他在一起
A suspect falls from a 20-story building and the only other person on that roof is you.

372
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,220
如果不作询问
这个部门就会显得很不负责
It would be irresponsible of this department to not ask a few questions.

373
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,810
我已经接受过询问了
The questions have been asked.

374
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,460
检察官对答案很满意
The D.A.Is satisfied with the answers.

375
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,840
你和我都知道这么做是为什么
You and I both know what this is.

376
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,360
你屈服于媒体压力
而我成了你个人政治利益的牺牲品
You're caving to media pressure, and I'm being made an example for your own political gain.

377
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,510
你是在暗示我是为了一己私欲?
So you're implying that I have a personal agenda here?

378
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,450
这么说还算客气的了 是的
That's the polite way of putting it, yeah.

379
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,070
那么就不要客气了 让我说清楚
Well, let's stop being polite and let me make something perfectly clear.

380
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:40,380
保持警局的正直和形象是我的责任
The integrity and image of the police department are my responsibility.

381
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,940
当一位警官涉嫌一名嫌犯的死亡
我就必须有所交待
When an officer is involved in the death of a suspect, I have to answer for that.

382
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,550
说得还真像局长候选人啊
Spoken like a true candidate for commissioner.

383
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,730
也许因为你每天舒舒服服的坐在实验室里
You know, maybe because you sit in the comfort of a lab every day, 

384
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,810
你接触不到市民对警局的看法
you're out of touch with the public's perception of the police department.

385
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:01,430
他们认为我们临驾于法律之上
做错任何事只要暗箱操作就可以了
See, they believe that we are above the law and any wrongdoing is just swept under the carpet.

386
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,390
而你要以我的事业为代价
主持这次的控诉来改变市民的看法?
And you're leading the charge to change that perception at the expense of my career?

387
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:11,560
Mac 我现在站的立场和你逮捕
Dean Truby警探时是一样的
I'm taking the same stand you took, mac, when you arrested detective dean truby.

388
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,610
是啊 我猜当你没站在警徽的角度时
就有点不一样了
Yeah, I guess it's a little bit different when you're on the other side of the badge.

389
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,450
如果你没做错什么 就没什么好担心的
If you didn't do anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about.

390
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,180
我是最后一个
I'm the last one.

391
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:35,970
其他曾受雇于Giuliani市长的人不是
被迫退休就是晋升到没有实权的行政工作
Everyone else hired under mayor giuliani you've either forced into retirement or promoted to powerless administrative jobs.

392
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,800
谢谢你保留我到最后
Good thing you saved me for last.

393
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,730
你会面对一场难以忘怀的抗争
You're about to face a fight you won't forget.

394
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,580
你好?
hello?

395
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,350
嘿 Adam
能把那张定格照片发到我手机上吗?
Hey, adam, can you send the freeze-frame to my phone?

396
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,970
好
Yeah.

397
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,700
我 我这就来
I, uh, I got it right here.

398
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,810
发过来了
It's on its way.

399
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,440
同样的两栋大楼
Same two buildings.

400
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,280
Toby Finch是个人体弹弓
Toby finch was a human slingshot.

401
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,010
蹦极绳是系在那里和那里的
而他大概是从这...
The bungees were attached there and there, and he was released...

402
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,820
被弹出去的
from right about here.

403
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,020
那就可以解释他的水平飞行和颈部损伤了
That explains his horizontal flight and neck injury.

404
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,920
是的
Yeah.

405
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,450
冲击力瞬间折断他的颈部
The force immediately snapped his neck.

406
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,070
伸展那些蹦极绳要花很大的力气
It would take a lot of strength to extend those bungee cords.

407
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,010
如果被系到那些柱子上
他的脚是不可能着地的
If he were attached to those pillars up there, his feet wouldn't be on the ground.

408
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,610
那么他是怎么回到这儿呢?
So how'd he get back here?

409
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,460
起艇绞车和一个朋友帮了点小忙
With a little help from a boat winch and a friend.

410
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:13,500
我还发现了数码照相机的电池包装
但是和受害者那找到的不一样
I also found some battery packaging consistent with a digital camera, but not compatible with the one we found on our vic.

411
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,910
还有别人拍下来了?
Somebody else got this on film?

412
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,020
还发现了另一组脚印...
Now, found another set of footprints...

413
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,190
在这里
here.

414
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,950
看上去象女性的高跟鞋
Looked to be a female's high heels.

415
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,490
好吧 Hawkes 去调查吧
All right, hawkes, run with it.

416
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,840
Mac 如果局里决定进行内部调查
我就得去回答问题
You know, mac, if the, uh, department decides to go through with their internal investigation, I'm gonna have to answer questions.

417
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,610
我知道的就是到楼顶时你告诉我的
All I know is what you told me when I got up to the top.

418
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,580
就像我告诉检察官的
我没有把Clay Dobson推下楼
Like I told the D.A., I did not toss clay dobson off that roof.

419
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,930
这次的调查只是场政治表演
This investigation is nothing but a big political show.

420
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,630
是啊
Yeah.

421
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:56,750
无论如何 媒体清楚这个故事 等他们
不愿再听时 你的说辞可就不管用了 Mac
Regardless, the media's soaking the story up, and by the time they're done with it, your word may not be good enough, mac.

422
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,140
Dobson!
Dobson!

423
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,730
把手举起来 跪下
Put your hands in the air and drop to your knees.

424
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,130
现在!
Now!

425
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,290
你说得没错--关于眼睛的事
You were right-- what you said about the eyes.

426
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,010
我希望她们看着
I wanted them to look.

427
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,490
我希望被我杀死的那些女孩知道
--知道她们最后看到的是我的脸
I wanted those girls I killed to know-- to know that my face was the last thing they were ever gonna see.

428
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,170
闭嘴
Shut uP.

429
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,830
跪下 把手放在头后
Drop to your knees, put your hands behind your head.

430
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,800
快做!
Do it!

431
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,380
你要怎么做 朝我开枪?
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

432
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,400
我都没有武器
I don't even have a weapon.

433
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,380
如果我死了 也要拉你陪葬
if I'm going, I'm taking you with me.

434
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,470
他是被铐上的!
He's cuffed!

435
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,330
那是你最后一次
见到你的朋友Toby 对吗?
That was the last time you saw your friend toby alive, wasn't it?

436
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,120
你能关掉吗?
Can you just turn it off?

437
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,730
我不知道Toby出了什么事
I don't know anything about what happened toby.

438
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,430
你知道 T.J.--Toby做人体弹弓的时候
你就在楼顶上
Yes, you do, T.J.-- You were on the roof when toby was playing human slingshot.

439
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,640
你录了下来 然后上传到一个网站上
You videotaped it, and you downloaded it to a web site.

440
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,490
你们逮到你了 孩子
We got you, kid.

441
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,660
你匿名在学校图书馆的电脑上上传的
You submitted it anonymously from one of the campus library computers, 

442
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:28,690
但是你没想到的是在你图书馆卡背后的
黑色磁条上储存的信息
but what you didn't think about was the information stored on that little black strip on the back of your library card.

443
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,420
T.J. Lindmark 地址 学号 最近的活动
T.J.Lindmark, address, student I.D.Number, recent activity.

444
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,600
我不知道你是怎么想的 但是...
I don't know what you're thinking, but...

445
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,110
我会告诉你我是怎么想的
I'll tell you what I'm thinking.

446
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:43,590
我们在楼顶找到了11号鞋的足印
并不属于Toby 还有被割蹦极绳上的指纹
We got size-11-tread prints on a rooftop that are not toby's, fingerprints on a cut bungee cord, 

447
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,230
而且证据显示蹦极绳是被
随身的小折刀切断的
and evidence that that cord was cut by a pocketknife.

448
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,330
我没有切断蹦极绳
I didn't cut the bungee cord.

449
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,370
我才刚知道它被割断了
I didn't even know it was cut until just now.

450
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,210
我以为Toby的事是个意外
I thought what happened to toby was an accident.

451
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:59,510
好吧 也许是拍视频的女孩做的
Okay, so maybe the girl who videotaped the whole thing, maybe she did it.

452
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,570
不是
No.

453
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,610
不是 Toby的女朋友绝不会那样做
No, toby-toby's girl would never do that.

454
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,050
Toby的女朋友有名字吗?
Toby's girl have a name?

455
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,030
Amy Newmer
Amy newmer.

456
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,100
她爱Toby
She loved toby.

457
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,750
我可以发誓 没人割断那绳子
I swear to you, nobody cut that cord.

458
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:16,730
我们只是上楼顶找乐子 试试那个弹射装置
Toby穿了那件傻呼呼的天使服装
We went on the roof to have fun, to take a ride on the slingshot contraption, and toby showed up in that goofy angel outfit.

459
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,690
你醉得太厉害了 伙计
You're too drunk, man.

460
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,850
我不知道
I don't know.

461
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,290
很明显 他是...
And it was obvious he was...

462
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,400
他喝了很多
he was drinking.

463
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,100
当那根蹦极绳断裂时 我和Amy都吓坏了
When that bungee cord snapped, me and amy freaked.

464
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,390
我不会杀死最好的朋友
I wouldn't kill my best friend.

465
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,800
你把视频放到了网站上
You downloaded that video to a web site.

466
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,990
10万元奖励最具胆量视频
$100,000 prize for the most daring video.

467
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,070
实况录下年轻人的死亡
Young kid's death caught on tape.

468
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,660
听起来就象赢定了
Sounds like a winner to me.

469
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,960
我把视频放上网站是为了Toby!
I put that video on the web site for toby!

470
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,830
他整天都说 要成为网络名人
That's all he ever talked about, was being an internet celebrity.

471
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,390
一位虚拟空间的明星
An e-lebrity.

472
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,780
你知道有多少孩子想一夜成名吗?
You know how many kids have gone from being nobodies to stardom overnight?

473
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:53,060
我是为了他 献给Toby的礼物
因为那就是他想要的
I did it for him, in tribute to toby, because that's what he would have wanted.

474
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,340
我认为不是T.J.割断了绳子
I don't think T.J.Severed that rope.

475
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,400
那会是谁?
Then who did?

476
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,050
我们需要恢复发射器里剩余的图象
We need to recover the rest of the images from that transmitter.

477
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,640
总有人割断了绳子
Somebody cut that bungee.

478
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,140
一定是在Toby戴上那套装备后
Had to be after toby got into that harness.

479
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,460
谢罪礼物
peace offering.

480
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,760
我收到了费城送来的证据
I had the evidence sent up from philly.

481
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,080
在费城 我们也有法医
We have forensic scientists in philadelphia, too.

482
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:37,460
听着 我无意冒犯 也相信
你们的工作人员都很称职
Look, I'm not trying to insult anyone, and I'm sure that everyone in your department is quite capable.

483
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,740
只是 也许我能解释某些他们无法解释的事
It's just that I might be able to explain something that they can'T.

484
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,680
也许我能解释某些突兀独立的证据
Evidence without context for them might mean something to me.

485
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,530
好吧 Stella 你来处理
Okay, stella, you're driving.

486
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,400
用你喜欢的方式
The way you like it.

487
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,860
你带头
Lead on.

488
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,410
行 很好
Okay, fine.

489
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,810
你们的人有列举这个烧伤的可能起因吗?
What do your people list as probable causes for this burn here?

490
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,230
有许多种可能性
There's a lot of possibilities.

491
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,320
好
Okay.

492
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,100
这个图案又怎么说?
How about this pattern here?

493
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,150
是的 我们查看过

494
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,660

507
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,220

513
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,200
似乎这就是你们的第一犯罪现场

00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,640
小指短了一截
Short pinky.

518
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,700
Marilyn Bennett
Marilyn bennett.

519
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,140
你清理了犯罪现场
You cleaned up the crime scene.

520
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,780
你的手印就在墙上
Your handprint was right up there on the wall.

521
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,730
沾满了血
In blood.

522
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,830
和你的完全吻合 Marilyn
It's a perfect match to you, marilyn.

523
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,640
发生了什么事?
What happened?

524
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,700
你发现了Mindy和Garth的事 决心杀了他们?
You find mindy and garth and decide to kill them?

525
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,680
因为我们还没找到他
'Cause we haven't been able to find him.

526
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,670
我没杀任何人
I didn't kill anybody.

527
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,150
对 但你不也说过...
Yeah, but what was it you said?

528
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,130
他所有的东西我都扔了
I got rid of every trace of him.

529
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,900
你没在开玩笑吧?
You weren't kidding, huh?

530
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,440
我没杀任何人
I didn't kill anybody.

531
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,340
你说起来就象你真的相信
You really say that like you believe it.

532
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,380
我是说 已经有段日子了 所以...
I mean, it's been a while, so...

533
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,870
我想在你的脑海里已变成了事实
over time I guess it becomes the truth in your mind.

534
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,160
那就是事实
It is the truth.

535
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,470
我不是凶手
I'm not a murderer.

536
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,320
我们提取了你的DNA
会拿去和凶器上的比对
We swabbed you for dna, and we're going to test that against the murder weapon.

537
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,030
以及你丢在费城路边的衣服
And the clothes that you dumped on the side of the road in philadelphia.

538
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,340
你干嘛不告诉我整个经过 就现在?
Okay, so, why don't you just tell me your story, right now?

539
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,950
我没杀任何人
I didn't kill anybody.

540
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,750
你要走了?
You heading out?

541
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,060
现在是你的案子了
Your case now.

542
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,960
怎么 你有发现了?
What, you find something?

543
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,460
放映室墙上找到的
喷溅动脉血迹的DNA结果出来了...
Dna came back on the arterial blood spatter, from the projection booth wall...

544
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,880
属于男性
male.

545
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,740
和高速公路边证物的DNA一致
Same dna that was on the turnpike evidence.

546
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,330
既然Garth Bennett已失踪近10年...
And since garth bennett's been missing for almost ten years...

547
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,840
很可能是他的
could be his.

548
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,500
当然 我们没找到他的尸体
Of course, we don't have his body.

549
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,640
那Marilyn呢?
And what about marilyn?

550
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,860
衣服不是她的尺寸
Clothes weren't her size.

551
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,540
她的DNA不在外套 衬衫或刀上
No evidence of her dna on the coat, blouse or knife.

552
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,620
如果她没杀丈夫 为何要清理犯罪现场?
So, why'd she clean up the crime scene, if she didn't kill her husband?

553
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,640
也许她在保护某个人
Maybe she was protecting someone.

554
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,500
现场还有第三人的DNA我们没找到主人
There is that third dna donor that we haven't identified yet.

555
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,750
Erin Yates 又名Mindy Sanchez
Erin yates, aka mindy sanchez.

556
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:38,090
她从看护中心逃跑 用了死亡女子的身份
She runs away from foster care and uses a dead woman's identity.

557
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,140
很难找到她
She's gonna be tough to find.

558
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,520
有消息通知我
Keep me posted.

559
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,990
我会的
Will do.

560
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:52,000
调查这些旧案时 有件事我一直不习惯
You know, one thing I never get used to about working these cold jobs.

561
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,200
什么?
What's that?

562
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,600
它们会唤醒尘封的过去
They stir up the past.

563
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,700
你多保重 警探
You take care of yourself, detective.

564
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,880
你也保重
You do the same.

565
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,260
我把Toby Finch相机里
剩余的图象都恢复了
I recovered the rest of the images from toby finch's camera.

566
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,960
他的朋友们以为他会是下一个人体投弹
但他另有计划
His friends thought he was gonna be the next human slingsho but he had other plans.

567
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,780
看一下
Take a look.

568
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,940
我用翅膀来当滑翔机翼
I got the same wingspan as a hang glider.

569
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:32,480
只需要足够的高度和动力 就能借用
曼哈顿地平线产生的上升暖气流
I just need enough height and momentum so I can work the updraft and thermal lifts created by manhattan's skyline.

570
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,760
一旦满足条件...
And once I reach them...

571
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,850
就解放了
release.

572
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:43,990
好吧
Okay.

573
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,280
他自己割的
He did it himself.

574
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,290
他割断了蹦极绳
He cut the bungee cords.

575
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:52,870
他指望首次前冲速度能超过绳子的强度
He was counting on the velocity of his first forward swing to overcome the strength of the cords.

576
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,080
以为一旦他跳下去 它们就会断开
He thought they would break as soon as he was launched, 

577
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:01,030
但绳子强度很高 反弹力折断了他的脖子
要了他的命
but the strength of the cords held and the force of the recoil snapped his neck, killing him.

578
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,360
他落地前就死了
He was dead weight before he even landed.

579
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:10,290
唯一的罪行就是Toby Finch错误的野心
the only crime here was toby finch's misdirected ambition.

580
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,400
就现在 准备起飞
Right here, prepare for takeoff!

581
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,940
开始!
Here we go!

582
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,200
- 准备--三 二 一...
- 互联网超胆侠
- Ready-- three, two, one... - internet daredevil.

583
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,680
找谁?
yes?

584
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,230
Victoria Page?
Victoria page?

585
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,450
我是...
I'M...

586
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,680
Stella Bonasera
stella bonasera.

587
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,620
我没见过你 自从...
I haven't seen you since...

588
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,540
我从警校毕业后
my graduation from the academy.

589
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,140
但你..
But you were...

590
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,930
那时叫Erin Yates
erin yates back then.

591
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,040
请进
Come in.

592
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,580
你怎么找到我的?
How did you find me?

593
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,360
Victoria Page
Victoria page.

594
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,340
红舞鞋
The red shoes.

595
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,250
我一直在...
I've been, uh...

596
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,210
调查这个案子 一直追查到老戏院
working this case that ended up at an old revival movie house.

597
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,680
就是Garth每周六带我们去的那家
The same one that garth took us to every saturday.

598
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,690
我希望有一天能象她一样跳舞
Someday I want to dance like her.

599
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,570
然后他会带你出去
Then he would take you away.

600
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,810
去放映室
To t projection booth.

601
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,030
他强奸了你 是吗?
He did things to you, didn't he?

602
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,230
Stella 不是这样的
Stella, this is a mistake.

603
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,780
几年以后 我冷静了下来想...
Years later, I put it all together...

604
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,430
记得我们坐在那里
remembering us sitting there.

605
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,430
他是如何轻叩你的肩膀
How he would tap you on the shoulder.

606
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,340
那部电影是我们的救命稻草
That movie was our escape.

607
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,010
你从那个噩梦中逃开以拯救自己
And you ran away from that nightmare to save yourself.

608
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,480
同时也救了我
And to save me.

609
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:57,280
你清楚如果你离开了 他们会把我送走
You knew that if you left, that they would send me away.

610
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,540
我再也不用面对Garth
And I would never have to deal with garth.

611
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,190
我知道他做了什么
I know what he did.

612
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,560
那一定在时刻折磨你
It must have haunted you.

613
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,180
那就是你杀他的原因
And that's why you killed him.

614
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,600
Stella 我没有 也不可能杀死任何人
stella, I didn't, and I couldn't kill anyone.

615
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,580
Marilyn为你清理了犯罪现场 Mindy
Marilyn cleaned up the crime scene for you, mindy.

616
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,930
还记得有几个晚上她为Garth送晚饭吗?
Remember how she used to bring garth dinner some nights?

617
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,900
也许她看到你离开
Maybe she saw you leave.

618
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,170
也许她知道原因
Maybe she knew why.

619
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,430
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

620
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,060
我们在费城高速公路边
发现了你埋掉的血衣
We found your bloody clothes on the side of the philly turnpike, where you buried them.

621
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,730
不 我不在那里
No, I wasn't there.

622
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,280
也许不是Mindy或Erin 而是Victoria Page
Maybe not as mindy or erin, but as victoria page.

623
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,640
你在华盛顿特区找了份工作
You had a job lined up in washington, D.C.

624
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,920
在你复仇之后 你直接南下
After you took your revenge, you headed south.

625
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,420
这就是你来这里的原因吗?
Is that why you're here?

626
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,850
来逮捕我?
To arrest me?

627
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,940
如果是几个月前 我会说"是"
A few months ago, I would have said yes.

628
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,300
但生活很奇怪
But life is strange.

629
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,140
我发现生活中有许多灰色区域
I found that it has these gray areas.

630
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:55,020
有时不是你选择了地狱
而是地狱选择了你
Sometimes you don't choose your own hell, it's chosen for you.

631
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,510
你只是做了该做的事 为了生存
And you do what you need to survive.

632
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,260
我今天来这 因为你是我唯一认识的姐妹
Today I'm here because you're the only sister I've ever known.

633
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,290
我的结拜姐妹 一生一世
My blood sister, forever and ever.

634
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,630
明天 我会戴着警徽来这里
Tomorrow, I have to come back with my badge.

635
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,620
很高兴见到你 Stella
It's good to see you, stella.

636
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,310
多多保重
You take care of yourself.

637
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,160
Tayloe侦探!
Detective taylor!

638
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,960
我再也找不到她了
I'll never find her.

639
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,520
因为你的缘故 我再也找不到她了
Because of you, I will never find her.

640
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,690
拜托 先生
Please, sir.

641
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,920
把枪放下
Just put down the gun.

642
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,570
你不想这样的
You don't want to do this.

643
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,950
他知道她在哪儿
He knew where she was.

644
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,760
但你杀了他
But you killed him.

645
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,680
现在我再也找不到我女儿了
And now I'll never find my daughter.

646
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,310
街上还有无辜者
There are innocent people on the street.

647
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,590
只要...
Just...

648
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,120
把枪给我
我们可以谈谈 不管你想要什么...
just hand me the gun, and we can talk about whatever you want...

649
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,260
别动!
don't move!

650
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,550
Lily...
lily...

651
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,800
她看上去
和Clay Dobson杀害的其他女孩一样
she looked just like those other girls that clay dobson killed.

652
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,540
你相信他也带走了她
You believe he took her, too.

653
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,700
