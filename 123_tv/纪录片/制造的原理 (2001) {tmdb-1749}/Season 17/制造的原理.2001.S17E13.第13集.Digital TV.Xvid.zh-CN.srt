1
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,577
Is it bad tonight?

2
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,956
Bad. That's one way to describe it.

3
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:07,126
Insane seems a little more appropriate.

4
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,921
It feels like he's breathing down my neck, man.

5
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,968
It is my professionaI opinion
we should get the hell out of here. Now.

6
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,845
Noted.

7
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,890
Clean this place up, then locate our guests.

8
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,775
I just need to take the edge off.

9
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,154
You know the routine.
I need you clear-headed.

10
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,782
First things first.

11
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,121
Now, where is he?

12
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,084
Show me where he's hiding.

13
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,644
Son of a bitch!
You said he only killed nine people.

14
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,271
There are 40 victims here.

15
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,482
Nine when he was alive.
He's added a few since then.

16
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,526
Now where is he, Dennis?

17
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,706
All teams go to alpha. Bring in the cube!

18
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,047
How did this guy get the name
"The Breaker"? Is he a truck driver?

19
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,551
Simple folkIore.
The locaI color exorcising its demons.

20
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,388
Maybe it's because he broke his victims
into as many pieces as possible.

21
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,894
I hate being rushed.

22
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,938
This one isn't like the others.

23
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,899
- I'll give you a bonus.
- You don't have that kind of money.

24
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,818
After tonight you'll be surprised.
Now, get to work.

25
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,702
CarefuI, Dennis.

26
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,248
Don't get too curious.

27
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,836
Son of a bitch!

28
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,757
How can you justify what you're doing,
Cyrus? It's out and out slavery!

29
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,719
You are persistent, Damon.
And what about you, Kalina?

30
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,682
Still carrying around
those ridiculous quicksilver flares?

31
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,892
You still have that quaint little magicaI book?

32
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,437
These aren't animals you're capturing,
they're human beings.

33
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,231
They are dead human beings.

34
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:37,277
Maybe you should join Greenpeace.
Throw blood on old women's furs.

35
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,155
Who are you to play God?

36
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,994
- Playing is for children.
- You'll never pull it off.

37
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,415
Not without the right spells.
That, and the thirteenth ghost.

38
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,916
Thirteenth ghost?

39
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,795
Get them out of my sight!
We've wasted too much time already.

40
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,590
Why did he say thirteenth?

41
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,009
Move the cube into position.

42
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,428
What's he talking about, 13 ghosts?

43
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,140
You contracted me for 12 ghosts!
The Breaker is 12!

44
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,434
I'm done after tonight, Cyrus.

45
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,813
Yes. Twelve and then one more.
I thought you were psychic!

46
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,982
That's not how it works, and you know it!

47
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,901
There's no time to argue.

48
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,403
Release the bait!

49
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,489
What bait? We never needed bait before!

50
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:40,006
A truck full of blood?
You've got to be shitting me.

51
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,761
Oh, boy.

52
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,142
Now...

53
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,728
...power up the cube.

54
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,487
Start transmitting.

55
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,227
Come.

56
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,313
Come.

57
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,148
Come!

58
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,243
Help me! Help me!

59
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,208
Oh, shit!

60
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,400
Put him down!

61
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:22,335
Cyrus, I hope you're happy.
You've got your twelve now.

62
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,129
Help me! He's dying!

63
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,800
Hang on, Damon. Somebody help!
God damn you, Cyrus!

64
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,469
Somebody help me, please!

65
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,181
Help me. Do something!

66
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,525
Oh, Cyrus.

67
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,443
Oh, God.

68
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,455
- Swing me!
- Come on, Bobby.

69
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,833
Faster, Kathy.

70
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,501
Let me get your arms.

71
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,295
Try to drag me.

72
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:09,674
You're the best little brother.
I love you. Let's go!

73
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,303
I'm going to get you! I'm going to get you!

74
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,600
Look at those two. She's got him
on the run now, but pretty soon...

75
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,103
...he's going to be picking her up
and throwing her over his shoulder.

76
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,355
They're perfect.

77
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,066
Watch them. Watch them.

78
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,070
They really love this place.

79
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,330
I love you.

80
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,123
Surprise!

81
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,835
My heart! My heart!

82
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,754
Happy birthday, Dad!

83
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,965
Happy birthday, Arthur.

84
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,800
Here's my present, Dad.

85
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,720
We love you. Make a wish.
Blow out the candles.

86
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,224
What did you wish for?

87
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,809
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

88
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,984
What's that? Why is the smoke alarm on?

89
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,612
It's the fire alarm.
I'll get the kids. Call the fire department.

90
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,405
Dad! Help, Mom!

91
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,617
Get the kids. Get the kids!

92
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,328
Mom! Dad! Help me!

93
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,956
Where's your mom? Where is she?

94
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,499
I don't know where Mom is.

95
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,418
Bobby, come on! We have to get out. Oh, my God!

96
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,003
Jean! Jean!

97
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:33,007
Mom's still in the house.
We can't leave her there.

98
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,344
Bobby, go outside. Go wait outside.

99
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,763
You can't go back in there, sir.

100
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,023
I'm sorry, sir. She didn't make it.

101
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,526
I should have gone back in.

102
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,950
We are gathered here today,
to honor the memory...

103
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,452
...and life's work of Jean Kriticos...

104
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,081
...a devoted mother and loving wife...

105
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,084
...who was too quickly taken from this life.

106
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:13,464
Jean, you will be forever missed,
but never forgotten.

107
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,885
I miss you, Mom.

108
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,429
Why did you have to leave us?

109
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,141
I can't do this without you.

110
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,851
I don't want you to go.

111
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,270
Mom, I love you so much.

112
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,898
Please watch over us.

113
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,818
I'll love you always.

114
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,705
Dad, it's...

115
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:51,294
It's almost 8:30.
Shake a leg or you'll miss your first class.

116
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:55,006
Today on Death in America:
"Cancer rates are down...

117
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,217
"... but suicide is sky-high.

118
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,594
"We have a speciaI treat for you today.

119
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,931
"A body was found this morning,
decolopolated. "

120
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,059
"Decapitated. "

121
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,186
Bobby honey, find a healthier hobby.

122
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,730
Leave me alone, you guys, I'm recording.

123
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,191
Good morning, everybody.

124
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,444
Something smells interesting.

125
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,864
Dad, they found a guy without a head
behind Dunkin' Donuts.

126
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,575
I love Dunkin' Donuts.

127
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,736
- Ow, shit!
- Kathy, kathy...

128
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,874
Why don't you let Maggie make breakfast for once.
Honey, that's why we hired her.

129
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,126
Dad, have you tasted Maggie's cooking?

130
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,087
Just that one time.

131
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,340
Hey, I heard that. Hell, I cook better than you.

132
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,384
We have to try to get along here.

133
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:45,473
Dad, will you tell Kathy that keeping
a record of death is healthy?

134
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,726
Kathy, "Keeping a record of death
is healthy. "

135
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,062
Because she's being a reaI slut about it.

136
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,274
Bobby. Don't call your sister a slut.

137
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,859
Thank you, Maggie.

138
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,236
I prefer the term "bitch. "

139
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,738
See, sluts are girls with loose sex--

140
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,074
Mr. Edgar Allan Poe,
did you do your homework?

141
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,451
Because Mr. Peterson-

142
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:10,582
Damn it! Bobby for the the third time
I've tripped on that stupid scooter!

143
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,251
- Sorry.
- If we had a bigger place, we wouldn't have this problem.

144
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,628
Well we don't have a big place anymore, do we?

145
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,505
This is the best I can do for now...

146
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,259
...so let's all try and keep our shit
off the floor.

147
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:25,138
All right? Now, Bobby,
put away the damn tape recorder.

148
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,640
Can you do that for me?
And get ready for schooI.

149
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,059
I'm sorry, Dad.

150
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,356
Must be the lawyer. I forgot.

151
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,359
Lawyer, what lawyer? Dad, our credit
was all cleaned up.

152
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,528
No, I don't think it's about that.

153
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,074
They won't make us move again, will they?

154
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,119
It's gonna be all right.
Whatever it is, we'll deaI with it.

155
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,747
Mr. Kriticos?

156
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,415
That's right. You are?

157
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,501
Ben Moss. How do you do?

158
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:55,919
Please, come in.

159
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,463
Is now a good time, or...?

160
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:03,343
As good a time as any.
Please, just give me one minute.

161
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,932
Sorry. I'm ready.

162
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,727
I represent the estate of your uncle
Cyrus Kriticos.

163
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,479
We have an Uncle Cyrus?

164
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:19,192
Had. I only met him a couple of times
as a kid.

165
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,902
He wasn't too popular.

166
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,696
My dad said
he squandered the family fortune.

167
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,406
We have a family fortune?

168
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,951
No. Cyrus squandered it.

169
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,578
Bobby, isn't that great?
You got a late uncle.

170
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,164
- What is he late for?
- His next birthday.

171
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,916
You mean, he's dead?

172
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,460
- Now we get his attention.
- Pipe down.

173
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,671
Cyrus recorded this message
six weeks ago.

174
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,715
He asked that it be played for you
in the event of his death.

175
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,101
Arthur...

176
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,271
...it's good to talk to you.

177
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,358
Sadly, if you're watching this now,
it means I am no longer among the living.

178
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:05,530
Happily, that makes you and your family
my sole beneficiaries.

179
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:08,032
I've instructed my lawyer, Mr. Moss...

180
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,829
...to deliver the essential elements
in my last will and testament.

181
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,873
Give it to them, Ben.

182
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,213
A key?

183
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,882
A key to what?

184
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,842
A key to your new house.

185
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,051
What?

186
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:31,222
This house is the fruit of my life's work.

187
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,852
Bathrooms.
Everyone gets their own bathroom.

188
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,020
Is this for reaI?

189
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:41,191
It is a one-of-a-kind home.
It's my home, actually.

190
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,236
My home.

191
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,948
I have no complaints.
I've led an interesting life.

192
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,202
I have seen some amazing things.

193
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:59,459
But the only regret I have, is that
I never got to know my nephew Arthur...

194
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,546
...nor appreciate the love of a family,
like you have.

195
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,717
This house is my attempt
to make up for that.

196
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,428
Enjoy.

197
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,183
Perhaps we'll meet again...

198
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,436
...in another life.

199
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,442
- Wow!
- When can we see it?

200
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,987
The house is yours whenever you like.
I'm heading up there after work.

201
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,865
If you want, you, your wife and kids-

202
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,117
Time-out. I am not the missus here.

203
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,370
My wife...

204
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,205
My wife is...

205
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,083
- Our mom got burned to death in a fire.
- Bobby!

206
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,126
What? It's true.

207
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,503
That's enough, Robert.

208
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:49,300
Mr. Moss, exactly where is this place?

209
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,137
A couple hours drive from here,
a town called Willow Grove...

210
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,722
...just up the parkway.

211
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:58,893
It's in a gorgeous area. But I have to
warn you, your uncle liked his privacy.

212
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,312
There isn't a neighbor for miles.

213
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,689
Come on. Hurry up.

214
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,650
S-U-F.

215
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,736
Suffocate. I got it. I win.

216
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,489
So what? You think you're so slick.

217
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,200
Come on, you guys. We're almost there.

218
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:20,165
- Excited?
- Yeah. Mom would have freaked over this.

219
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,421
Looks like things are
starting to get better, right?

220
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,797
Yeah.

221
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,341
That's strange.

222
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,763
Dad, it's beautifuI.

223
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:04,102
My God. I've never seen anything like it.

224
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,981
CooI!

225
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,692
So futuroic.

226
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,077
It's about time somebody showed up.
Is this your place?

227
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,621
- Who are you?
- I'm the power guy.

228
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,833
Don't touch.

229
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:31,379
Your house is knocking out the power
of the whole tri-quad area.

230
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,631
I need to get inside
and check the breakers.

231
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,593
Could you come back tomorrow?
Is that maybe a possibility?

232
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,303
Tomorrow? Let me see.

233
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:42,015
Oh, there's about 5,570 houses
right now without power.

234
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,142
My bosses kind of frown on that, so...

235
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,187
Right, well that's not really our problem, is it?

236
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,483
Look, buddy, I've been doing this job
for about three weeks.

237
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,028
Is there any way you can give
me a little bit of a break here?

238
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,321
Sure.

239
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,947
No problem.

240
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,742
Thank you.

241
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:02,785
Mr...?

242
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,913
Kriticos. Arthur Kriticos.

243
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,541
It's quite a place you've got.

244
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,544
Yeah. We're moving in.

245
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,505
One step at a time.

246
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,359
- That's odd.
- Dad, you broke it.

247
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,277
Bobby, give it a rest.

248
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,867
Hello.

249
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,371
Wow! You can see right through it.

250
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,541
What, you guys couldn't afford any walls?

251
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,209
How weird.

252
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:54,337
Guess Uncle Cyrus wasn't too keen
on privacy.

253
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,132
I sure hope the bathroom's in the basement...

254
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,634
It's like a funhouse.

255
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,096
It's Latin.

256
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,942
Everything's so beautifuI.

257
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:04,574
Family, just so we're all clear,
Miss Maggie does not do windows, O.K?

258
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,075
Wow!

259
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,043
What an incredible wealth of knowledge.

260
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,423
- A samurai sword.
- Bobby!

261
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,634
In your dreams, paI.

262
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,473
Dad, this stuff must be worth a fortune.

263
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,184
Yeah, that occurred to me, too.

264
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,444
Oh, Cyrus.

265
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:45,198
You crazy son of a bitch, what did you do?

266
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,174
Goodness.

267
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,510
It's like a cathedraI.

268
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:10,265
All right, first rule: No throwing stones.

269
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,434
It's marvelous, though, isn't it?

270
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,312
A living work of art.

271
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,987
The sooner you show me
where you hid the basement...

272
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,447
...the sooner I can get my ass out of here.

273
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,451
I believe it's down the hall.
It's two doors on the right.

274
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,124
Excuse me.

275
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,506
The construction is amazing.

276
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,552
I'm getting dizzy.

277
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,807
Bobby.

278
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,561
Don't touch anything. Okay?

279
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,773
At least untiI we get property insurance.

280
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,152
Arthur, we've got some papers to sign
in the library.

281
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:07,655
After that, I'd love to give you
and your family a tour of the house.

282
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,159
Great. I don't want you guys to move
from this spot.

283
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,452
We'll be right back.

284
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:15,205
Dad, you're being paranoid and overprotective.

285
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,665
Yeah, of all this stuff.

286
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,376
I know you guys too well. Stay...

287
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,172
...right here. I mean it.

288
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,113
What the...?

289
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,133
Where'd you hide your money, old man?

290
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,608
Oh! Shit!

291
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,611
What the hell was that?

292
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,120
Oh, no.

293
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:38,997
Oh, Cyrus.

294
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,336
Alright, now I know I'm dreaming.

295
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,132
Was Cyrus a hunter?

296
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,675
You could say that.

297
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,554
Your uncle was quite a collector
of many things.

298
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,107
I've marked where
you're supposed to sign, Arthur.

299
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,692
Okay, look.

300
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:12,030
I didn't want to bring this up
in front of the kids...

301
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:16,993
...but this place is beyond amazing.

302
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,584
I'm just a math teacher.

303
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,921
The taxes alone must be...

304
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:30,381
I have nothing set aside.

305
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:36,304
To be honest, a fire took away everything.

306
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,681
Arthur, you don't need to worry.

307
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:42,894
Cyrus was a genius
when it came to finances.

308
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:46,898
Basically, you and your family don't
ever have to worry about money again.

309
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,445
Son of a bitch.

310
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:52,380
Lookee here. Look, y'all.

311
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,341
Look, look!

312
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,225
Sign.

313
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:06,978
Arthur?

314
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:10,982
Arthur, we've got to...

315
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,526
We have to talk.

316
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,653
What is the deaI with the breakers?

317
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:20,116
There's nothing wrong with the breakers.
I'm not the power guy. My name is Dennis Rafkin.

318
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,494
- You're Dennis Rafkin?
- Who's Dennis Rafkin?

319
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,537
My office warned me about this guy.

320
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:27,707
I know this will sound completely
whacked, but just stay with me.

321
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,920
I used to hunt displaced spirituaI energies
with your uncle.

322
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,379
I'm sorry?

323
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:37,467
PK agents. Revenants. Wraiths. Wraiths?

324
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:40,345
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

325
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,641
That's okay, I'll do this the easy way: ghosts.

326
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:47,143
Arthur, I used to...

327
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:50,605
I used to hunt ghosts
with your Uncle Cyrus.

328
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:53,525
Goats?

329
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:56,653
Ghosts! Ghosts, goddamn it!
Listen to me!

330
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,613
Race you to the end of the hall.

331
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,199
No, Bobby, I don't think this is the place-

332
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:04,702
Come on, slowpoke!
Is that the best you got?

333
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:07,205
My grandma scoots better than that.

334
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:12,585
Ghosts. As in disgruntled spirits
trapped on earth. Ghosts.

335
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,087
As in Halloween? Boo?

336
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,131
As in Demi Moore
and Unchained Melody. Ghosts.

337
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:20,343
Ghosts. Okay, I get it. I'm scared.

338
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:23,012
Don't laugh at me. Don't laugh.

339
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,473
I'll explain everything...

340
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:29,143
...as soon as you get
you and your children outside.

341
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,396
- What's taking you so long?
- Out of my way.

342
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,898
- I don't think scooting is your game.
- Come on.

343
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,068
- I won.
- You cheated. That wasn't fair. I didn't get a start.

344
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,820
Got to be on your toes, man.

345
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:42,782
This has to be my room.
There are toys everywhere.

346
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:46,995
- I wonder what my room's gonna look like.
- And now entering the coolest room in the house.

347
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,585
I'll be in here.

348
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:11,519
This place is awesome!

349
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:15,607
Look, Cyrus has containment
cubes all over the basement.

350
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,234
I don't know why they're here...

351
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:21,237
...and I am not staying around to find out.

352
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,781
- So, if I were you-
- Well, he isn't you.

353
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:27,327
This guy has been harassing my office
since your uncle died.

354
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,454
I see this all the time.

355
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:32,916
Some rich guy passes away
and all the nuts come out!

356
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,419
Next thing, he'll be claiming
Cyrus owned him money or-

357
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:39,839
He did owe me money.
He owed me a shitload of money!

358
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:42,550
These are some funky-looking specs here.

359
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:47,972
- What do you think? Do I look cooI or what?
- Let me see.

360
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,933
Not so fast. You gotta cater to my ego first:

361
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,935
"Maggie's the best babysitter
you ever had. "

362
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,978
- Come on!
- All right.

363
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:56,981
I'm getting my ass
out of the big glass house!

364
00:30:57,524 --> 00:30:59,943
Grab your children! Do the same.

365
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,112
Are you all right?

366
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,458
Jean! Jean!

367
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,964
We'll go get you some help. Okay?

368
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,216
Don't touch me.

369
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,811
Oh, my God!

370
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:44,863
We've struck gold.

371
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:48,116
- Easy.
- Don't.

372
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,460
How's your head?

373
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:01,838
Not good.

374
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,674
Where's the suit?

375
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,647
Power guy. Idiot.

376
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:22,650
Whoa, cooI!

377
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:25,320
Better have a pair of those in my room.

378
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:27,238
Bobby, where are you going?

379
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,286
What are you staring at?

380
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:37,081
Hey, kiddo.

381
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,210
He thinks I'm going to duck.

382
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:42,670
Hey... nice tits.

383
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,718
What's the matter, honey?
Bad representation?

384
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,373
Not bad for an hourly wage.

385
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:30,927
It's time to leave.

386
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:33,179
I'll take your word for it.

387
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,182
Kathy?

388
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,275
Come on. This way.

389
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:51,990
Shit! What the hell? Kathy!

390
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:56,035
Maggie? Bobby!

391
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:21,853
Hey, I uhh...

392
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,775
I was just kidding before.

393
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,061
A little lawyer humor.

394
00:34:30,262 --> 00:34:32,462
Really?

395
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:07,440
Kathy?

396
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,275
Bobby!

397
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:14,656
I don't believe it.

398
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,115
Believe what?

399
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:22,288
- I told them not to leave this spot.
- They're kids, what do you expect?

400
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:25,917
Thank you, Dr. PhiI. You check downstairs.
I'II look up.

401
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,294
Bobby, come on! It's time to go!

402
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:39,264
Kathy? Where are you guys?

403
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:40,557
Bobby!

404
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:45,019
I'm sorry.

405
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,602
I'm sorry.

406
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:01,823
What are you doing up here?
I told you to wait downstairs.

407
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:05,160
Yeah but Dad, come on.
This bathroom is unbelievable.

408
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:08,788
Great house. BeautifuI bathroom.
Now, where is your brother?

409
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:10,999
He's with Maggie.

410
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:15,503
Was with Maggie. We were racing
and we saw all the glass-

411
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:19,591
That's good. You're supposed to
watch him. That's what I pay you for.

412
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:31,895
Bobby.

413
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,525
Down here.

414
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:39,777
Maggie?

415
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,113
Come on down and play.

416
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:43,990
Is that you?

417
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,327
Maggie?

418
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:49,078
Stop playing games.

419
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:53,833
Bobby? I have something for you.
We'll have lots of fun.

420
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,253
Don't come down, Bobby.

421
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,131
Stay upstairs.

422
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:04,135
Don't follow her.

423
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:08,139
Down here, Bobby.

424
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:13,019
Bobby, don't come down, honey.

425
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:17,482
Bobby? Around the corner.

426
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:20,819
Don't come down here!

427
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:22,362
That's it.

428
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,405
You guys, I'm gonna tell Dad!

429
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:27,158
Bobby!

430
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:32,747
I'll find Bobby.
But I want you both out of here.

431
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,249
- But, Dad-
- No "buts"!

432
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:37,919
I want you both to wait in the car.
I'll be out as soon as I find the kid.

433
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:41,631
- Why are you freaking out?
- Just this once, don't argue with me.

434
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:46,052
What happened to the door?

435
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:48,179
Son of a bitch!

436
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:50,181
I cannot believe this.

437
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:53,226
I'm going to have to break it down.
Back away!

438
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:01,568
It's quite dramatic...

439
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:04,737
...but you're wasting your time.
It's all sealed up.

440
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:07,907
- Weren't you in an orange jumpsuit?
- Don't go there.

441
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,784
What do you mean, "all sealed up"?

442
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,662
What part of that code
are you having trouble cracking?

443
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:14,372
The entire house is sealed up.

444
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:17,625
- There must be another way out.
- I've looked.

445
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:20,795
We'II look again, right after I find my son.
Now get up.

446
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:22,922
That's all right, I'll wait right here.

447
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:28,720
I don't know what the hell is going on here,
I really don't know who the hell you are.

448
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:30,972
And my son is missing.

449
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:34,309
So, untiI those questions are answered,
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

450
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:36,561
Now, get up!

451
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:40,231
All right. Breathe.

452
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,237
Did the lawyer split?

453
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,124
Bobby.

454
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:01,503
Bobby.

455
00:42:00,645 --> 00:42:03,064
Come on, guys! Stop hiding!

456
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:10,363
Bobby!

457
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,282
- Bobby.
- Come on out now, paI!

458
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:13,700
Stop screwing around.

459
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:16,578
Glass family Robinson,
you're wasting your breath.

460
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:19,372
This is ectobar glass. He's not gonna hear you.

461
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:21,749
This is shatterproof and soundproof.

462
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:23,459
What are these?

463
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:27,505
That's a little harder to explain.
They're containment spells.

464
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:29,299
Ghosts can't cross those.

465
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:32,385
- Ghosts?
- Yes, ghosts.

466
00:42:33,428 --> 00:42:37,682
The supernaturaI realm has its own
set of laws. For ghosts, it's spells.

467
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:42,103
Written or spoken, the ghosts
have to obey whatever the spells say.

468
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:04,209
The entire basement is filled with ghosts.

469
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:05,919
In this basement?

470
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:08,965
Of course, in this basement.
What is it with you people?

471
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,003
If it was next door, I wouldn't give a shit!

472
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:14,552
Dad!

473
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,764
- I can prove it.
- Hey, I gave a pair of those to Bobby.

474
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,230
SpectraI viewers.
You can see ghosts with these.

475
00:43:25,313 --> 00:43:27,023
Bobby, come on.

476
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:30,276
- I don't see any ghosts.
- Because they're locked downstairs.

477
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:31,736
Dad!

478
00:43:32,403 --> 00:43:35,114
There's more of this crazy spell shit
on the floor.

479
00:43:36,574 --> 00:43:38,076
Let me see those.

480
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:48,086
Bobby! Come on out, paI!

481
00:43:49,504 --> 00:43:53,633
Hidden barrier spells. You gotta be kiddin' me.
Why would he need more protection?

482
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:56,803
All right, that's enough.
This is not helping.

483
00:43:56,886 --> 00:44:00,056
I want you to do me a favor and stop
with all the haunted house nonsense...

484
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:03,142
...at least untiI we find the kid
and figure a way out of here.

485
00:44:03,768 --> 00:44:04,936
Bobby, come on.

486
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:06,646
I don't know where he could be.

487
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:08,815
Wait, no, no, no, no!

488
00:44:09,774 --> 00:44:11,109
Wait, no!

489
00:44:11,442 --> 00:44:15,697
What are you doing? What did I just say,
that there was a petting zoo downstairs?

490
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:16,990
No!

491
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:19,868
There are ghosts downstairs, Arthur.

492
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:23,037
Right, right. But you also said...

493
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:26,749
...that they're all locked up. Right?

494
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:30,086
- No. No way.
- Wait.

495
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:32,797
Listen.

496
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:36,759
I'll make a deaI with you.

497
00:44:36,843 --> 00:44:39,512
I'll pay you whatever Cyrus owed you...

498
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:43,516
...if you just help me...

499
00:44:44,517 --> 00:44:46,352
...find my son.

500
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:01,367
Unbelievable. Get out of my way.

501
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,211
Bobby.

502
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:33,733
Get out of the basement.
You need to go upstairs.

503
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:39,572
You need to put on those glasses.

504
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:42,075
Leave me alone!

505
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:47,413
That's it. That's a good boy.

506
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:54,087
Bobby.

507
00:45:56,923 --> 00:45:58,091
Bobby.

508
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:00,927
Go upstairs and find your father.

509
00:46:02,136 --> 00:46:03,012
Mom?

510
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:04,430
Go on.

511
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:07,517
Go upstairs!

512
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,438
Go find Kathy.

513
00:46:13,439 --> 00:46:14,816
Watch out.

514
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:18,653
Watch out.

515
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,738
Bobby! Come on!

516
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:27,453
You don't have to scream, all right? Just...

517
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:29,789
...chill.

518
00:46:48,766 --> 00:46:51,060
- This way.
- Hold on. Listen to me.

519
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:55,773
This will take forever.
This place is just too big.

520
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:02,322
Kathy and I will head up this way.
You two check down there.

521
00:47:02,363 --> 00:47:05,158
- No, I don't think we should split up.
- It's okay.

522
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:09,871
Go in a straight line, turn around.
We'll meet back here in five.

523
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:13,124
Five. Back here.

524
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,751
Don't touch anything.

525
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:17,212
- I don't want to go with him!
- Go ahead.

526
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:28,598
Wait a second.
Let's go back to the ghost thingy.

527
00:47:28,848 --> 00:47:33,019
There are ghosts in the basement.
If you don't believe me, look for yourself.

528
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,271
I told you, I can't see any ghosts.

529
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:39,859
What the hell? Give me those.
Let me see. Why are these open?

530
00:47:40,693 --> 00:47:43,530
I was down here before.
They weren't open.

531
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:48,576
- Oh, God! I hate it when they do that!
- Do what?

532
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:53,665
They wait for you to stick your face
right up against the glass, then give you...

533
00:47:54,165 --> 00:47:56,000
...a big, fat "boo"!

534
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:57,544
Don't do that!

535
00:48:02,006 --> 00:48:03,049
God.

536
00:48:03,508 --> 00:48:04,759
You see it?

537
00:48:05,635 --> 00:48:07,428
- It's, it's...
- A ghost. It's a ghost!

538
00:48:07,512 --> 00:48:11,349
Just like I've been saying all night!
Finally, a believer! Thank you O Lord Jesus!

539
00:48:11,724 --> 00:48:15,019
There are ghosts around us all the time.
Most of them can't hurt us.

540
00:48:15,436 --> 00:48:19,732
Most don't even wanna hurt us. A little
ghost here, a little ghosts there, no one cares.

541
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:22,861
But there are exceptions,
like this badass behind me.

542
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:27,157
The ones who die violent deaths stay in
a tortured realm, so that's all they know.

543
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:29,033
What is he doing?

544
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:32,745
I don't know. I can't see.
I don't have the glasses.

545
00:48:35,748 --> 00:48:38,334
Okay, I've had it with this. It's time to go.

546
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:40,753
- Now! Please!
- Don't touch me.

547
00:48:41,796 --> 00:48:43,339
Will you come on?

548
00:48:49,512 --> 00:48:52,223
Come on, ghost boy! Move your ass!
It's time to go.

549
00:48:54,976 --> 00:48:57,979
Dad, slow down. We're going to get lost.

550
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:19,124
Dad! Aaahhh!!

551
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:28,801
Dad.

552
00:49:29,135 --> 00:49:30,803
Listen to me.

553
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:33,473
He's going to be okay.

554
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:36,226
We're going to find him.

555
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:39,312
I am so ready to leave this place.

556
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,148
- Oh, boy.
- What?

557
00:49:43,107 --> 00:49:46,194
- That's the symboI of The JackaI.
- What's The JackaI?

558
00:49:46,277 --> 00:49:50,490
The JackaI is the Charlie Manson of ghosts.
And if The Jackal's out, screw the kid.

559
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:52,742
We've got to get out of this basement.

560
00:49:53,326 --> 00:49:55,995
Maybe Rafkin was right, and maybe there-

561
00:49:56,037 --> 00:49:57,205
Kathy!

562
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,667
Think about what you're saying.

563
00:50:02,335 --> 00:50:04,420
There is no such thing as ghosts.

564
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:19,018
Kathy.

565
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:22,772
Kathy!

566
00:50:34,951 --> 00:50:38,037
What is it? I can't see it!
Tell me where it is!

567
00:50:39,038 --> 00:50:40,206
Get off!

568
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:44,627
Hold on! Stay with me!

569
00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:56,556
Come on, pull!

570
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:59,809
- Who are you?
- Never mind, just pull, god damn it!.

571
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:04,772
Shit! Don't speak. Don't move.

572
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:07,484
Somehow...

573
00:51:08,234 --> 00:51:10,111
...we got behind enemy lines.

574
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:20,788
Hurry!

575
00:51:20,997 --> 00:51:22,332
Please, hurry!

576
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:26,002
Hey, little guy.

577
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:28,087
- How.
- I don't think you should be teasing the ghosts.

578
00:51:28,129 --> 00:51:31,758
- Will you shut up?
- You shut up. You're the one that keeps pissing them off.

579
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:35,512
Go.

580
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,935
- Maggie!
- What?

581
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:50,860
Where?
I can't see shit without the glasses, idiot!

582
00:51:51,194 --> 00:51:54,823
Well, I can see.
And I think you should go this way!

583
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,367
Go, go!

584
00:52:01,204 --> 00:52:03,164
It's all right. I've got you.

585
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:05,708
Look at me.

586
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:07,794
Daddy.

587
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:10,046
It's okay.

588
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:22,350
Who the hell are you?

589
00:52:22,725 --> 00:52:25,145
And what the hell was that?

590
00:52:25,728 --> 00:52:29,190
My name is Kalina Oretzia.
I'm in the spirit reclamation business.

591
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:30,275
What?

592
00:52:30,733 --> 00:52:32,402
I free trapped souls. Cyrus-

593
00:52:32,485 --> 00:52:35,822
Forget Cyrus and trapped souls
for a goddamned second.

594
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:38,408
What are you doing here?

595
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:41,703
Looks to me like I'm saving your ass.

596
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:46,499
Oh, my God!
It's over there! It's over there!

597
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:48,668
Give him your glasses.

598
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:50,587
Come on!

599
00:53:04,767 --> 00:53:06,102
Oh, my God.

600
00:53:08,938 --> 00:53:10,440
Unbelievable.

601
00:53:10,565 --> 00:53:12,901
Another one of Cyrus's victims.

602
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:16,112
I hope to God the barrier spells hold.

603
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,781
Victims?

604
00:53:19,365 --> 00:53:21,868
Cyrus had a nasty habit of enslaving souls.

605
00:53:21,993 --> 00:53:24,871
That's why I'm here.
I intend to set them all free.

606
00:53:24,954 --> 00:53:26,331
Listen to me.

607
00:53:26,956 --> 00:53:28,541
I need to know...

608
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,044
...how you got in here.

609
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:34,422
I slipped through an opening in the house
when it shifted.

610
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:37,967
- An opening where?
- Don't get your hopes up. It's closed now. It won't happen again.

611
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:41,638
Let me show you. This is the Arcanum.

612
00:53:42,138 --> 00:53:44,307
Many people died
in the quest for this book.

613
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,769
It was written in the 15th century
by an astrologer named Basileus.

614
00:53:47,852 --> 00:53:50,814
In it, he describes
the making of a certain machine.

615
00:53:50,897 --> 00:53:53,316
One that can see into the future.

616
00:53:53,399 --> 00:53:56,069
He wrote it while he was under
demonic possession.

617
00:53:56,486 --> 00:53:58,488
I can't believe Cyrus built it.

618
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:01,991
Built what? What are you talking about?

619
00:54:02,325 --> 00:54:03,993
Basileus's device.

620
00:54:04,077 --> 00:54:08,581
We're in the middle of a machine, designed
by the deviI and powered by the dead.

621
00:54:09,624 --> 00:54:10,959
Listen to me.

622
00:54:12,502 --> 00:54:14,921
I don't give a shit about any machine...

623
00:54:15,296 --> 00:54:17,757
...or deviI or Basileus or anything...

624
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:21,511
...except getting my family
the hell out of this place.

625
00:54:22,303 --> 00:54:25,849
I came here
to set the souls in this house free.

626
00:54:26,182 --> 00:54:29,185
You want help, you have to help me first.

627
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,605
Kathy, can you walk?

628
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:38,361
Kathy! Oh, no. This can't be happening!

629
00:54:38,444 --> 00:54:41,823
- We have to get out of here.
- I'm not going anywhere without my kids.

630
00:54:41,865 --> 00:54:43,449
Try telling him that.

631
00:54:50,373 --> 00:54:51,708
Come on.

632
00:55:03,052 --> 00:55:05,388
This way. Come on.

633
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:09,559
Stairs. Let's go.

634
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:13,396
Go. You go!

635
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:16,900
Don't touch me!

636
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:18,902
Wait! The glasses!

637
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:20,904
You'll need these! Catch!

638
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:33,041
- Good job.
- Sorry.

639
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:42,800
Perfect. Another dead end.

640
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:45,887
Okay, genius, we found the stairs.
How do we get to them?

641
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:48,139
- Get away.
- What? What do we do now?

642
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,058
Get away from the glass.

643
00:55:50,141 --> 00:55:52,310
- Why?
- Just do it.

644
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:17,335
Glasses.

645
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:24,467
Duck!

646
00:56:25,426 --> 00:56:26,886
Move! Go left!

647
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:30,348
Do something, for Christ's sake!
We're running out of corridors!

648
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:33,518
Duck! Go left! Go right! Move!

649
00:56:35,436 --> 00:56:36,688
Get down!

650
00:56:41,776 --> 00:56:45,738
Here. We've got to get to the library.
It has spell protection all around it.

651
00:56:46,614 --> 00:56:48,366
Where is that from here?

652
00:57:06,843 --> 00:57:09,220
Can I rely on you not to get me killed?

653
00:57:09,846 --> 00:57:11,431
I guarantee nothing.

654
00:57:25,403 --> 00:57:27,071
See anything?

655
00:57:30,909 --> 00:57:32,535
- Anything?
- No.

656
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:36,080
Come on.

657
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:38,833
I think they're just downstairs.

658
00:57:42,754 --> 00:57:44,088
Nothing.

659
00:57:47,175 --> 00:57:50,512
If we get out of this alive,
I've got to get a pay raise.

660
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:53,640
That's a big "if. "

661
00:57:56,935 --> 00:57:58,144
Give me the flare.

662
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:05,276
What's wrong?
Don't start freaking out now. Come on.

663
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:15,537
What?

664
00:58:19,123 --> 00:58:21,125
- Okay. What?
- Shut up.

665
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:23,044
Give me the book.

666
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:28,299
Just back up.

667
00:58:30,718 --> 00:58:32,387
Go. Slow.

668
00:58:32,595 --> 00:58:34,472
- I'm going slow.
- Slow.

669
00:58:35,056 --> 00:58:36,808
Go! Go!

670
00:58:37,141 --> 00:58:38,476
Fast!

671
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:43,857
- What the hell?
- Who the hell?

672
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,817
What the hell are you doing here?

673
00:58:52,824 --> 00:58:54,033
Shit!

674
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,664
Remember me?

675
00:59:08,673 --> 00:59:10,425
Thanks for taking your time.

676
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:12,719
Go down the hall. Turn left, then right.

677
00:59:12,802 --> 00:59:14,888
- Where are we going?
- Trust me, okay?

678
00:59:14,971 --> 00:59:16,848
- Arthur?
- Trust her.

679
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:18,725
Okay, let's go!

680
00:59:18,808 --> 00:59:21,227
- Who the hell is she?
- I'll explain her later.

681
01:00:27,752 --> 01:00:29,254
What happened to Kathy?

682
01:00:29,337 --> 01:00:30,964
I don't know, she disappeared.

683
01:00:31,005 --> 01:00:34,133
How do you lose an entire family
in a glass house?

684
01:00:44,936 --> 01:00:46,229
Arthur!

685
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:51,151
Kalina, give me a flare!

686
01:00:58,449 --> 01:01:00,785
Get him! Go! Get up!

687
01:01:01,077 --> 01:01:03,746
This is not the time to be a girI! Run!

688
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:07,834
Stop dragging your ass, man! Go!

689
01:01:08,376 --> 01:01:10,503
Oh, my God! Go! Run!

690
01:01:10,545 --> 01:01:13,673
Now is not the time
to sit around, Arthur! Run!

691
01:01:13,923 --> 01:01:15,884
Get the door. Close the door!

692
01:01:20,555 --> 01:01:22,599
Arthur, are you all right?

693
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:26,978
God, what's going on here?
Fucking ghosts.

694
01:01:27,395 --> 01:01:28,855
I hate this job.

695
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:32,066
They don't seem to like you, either. I wonder why.

696
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:36,946
You got something to say, say it.

697
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:40,283
All right. Let's start with:
This is all your goddamn fault!

698
01:01:40,366 --> 01:01:43,244
If you hadn't caught them,
we wouldn't be running from them.

699
01:01:43,286 --> 01:01:45,288
It was his uncle that built the house!

700
01:01:45,371 --> 01:01:48,958
You helped him. How could you help him
without knowing what he was doing?

701
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,341
- I had my reasons.
- Money, you parasite.

702
01:01:56,424 --> 01:02:00,220
You stole people's souls for money!
How depraved is that?

703
01:02:00,553 --> 01:02:03,389
If you haven't noticed, I'm a little bit of a freak!

704
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:06,935
I come within 10 feet of anything dead,
I go into seizures.

705
01:02:07,018 --> 01:02:11,773
I touch somebody, a whole life full of shit
flashes in front of my eyes.

706
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:13,858
So, yeah, I'm depraved.

707
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:16,486
But Cyrus was my friend,
and he accepted me.

708
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:20,573
He didn't accept you. You're so pathetic!

709
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:23,618
- He used you.
- Shut up, both of you.

710
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:27,872
Cut him some slack.
What difference does it make?

711
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:31,626
You didn't tell him, did you?

712
01:02:32,585 --> 01:02:34,587
Oh, God, tell me what? What now?

713
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:36,923
About the fourth ghost.

714
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:42,011
Don't do this. I didn't tell him.

715
01:02:42,136 --> 01:02:43,805
He has a right to know.

716
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:48,434
What about the fourth ghost?

717
01:02:49,602 --> 01:02:52,689
St. Luke's HospitaI. Six months ago.

718
01:03:02,448 --> 01:03:05,118
You're saying my wife's spirit...

719
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:07,370
...is trapped in this house?

720
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:11,624
I didn't know you.

721
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:15,712
I didn't know her.
I didn't know she had a husband.

722
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:23,678
Why? In God's name, why?
Tell me, why her?

723
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:26,681
I don't know. Cyrus handpicked them,
including your wife.

724
01:03:26,723 --> 01:03:29,559
I figured out who you were
and I've been trying to help you.

725
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:34,063
You call this help? She's right!
This is all your goddamn fault!

726
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:36,316
Son of a bitch!

727
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:41,154
You can save her. And your kids, too.

728
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:44,407
Just listen to me and believe me.

729
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:47,076
This house is not a house.

730
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,246
It is a machine.

731
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:56,377
A complete and faithfuI re-creation
of Basileus's design.

732
01:03:57,003 --> 01:04:00,507
According to this, there should be
12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.

733
01:04:01,174 --> 01:04:04,344
See these?
They represent the black zodiac.

734
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:08,139
They represent the ghosts that
Cyrus needed to catch: The First-Born Son.

735
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:09,724
I don't want to play.

736
01:04:11,601 --> 01:04:12,852
The Torso.

737
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:16,981
The Bound Woman.

738
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:21,569
The Withered Lover.

739
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:24,405
Jean.

740
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:32,956
Bobby. I love you.

741
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:36,876
The Torn Prince.

742
01:04:39,879 --> 01:04:41,381
The Angry Princess.

743
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:42,924
I'm sorry.

744
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:44,884
The Pilgrimess.

745
01:04:46,427 --> 01:04:48,263
The Great Child and the Dire Mother.

746
01:04:50,932 --> 01:04:52,559
The Hammer.

747
01:04:55,228 --> 01:04:58,606
And here, the sign of Hell's Winter:
The JackaI.

748
01:05:01,693 --> 01:05:03,153
And The Juggernaut.

749
01:05:06,156 --> 01:05:08,366
According to Basileus, the machine required the energy...

750
01:05:08,449 --> 01:05:11,327
...of these specific spirits
in order to bring it to life.

751
01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:14,414
Once it engages,
the spirits are released one by one.

752
01:05:14,747 --> 01:05:16,916
The house then draws them to its center.

753
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:20,378
Each one adds its energy to the machine,
powering it up.

754
01:05:21,921 --> 01:05:23,882
Powering it up for what?

755
01:05:23,965 --> 01:05:25,884
To open the Ocularis Infernum.

756
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:27,677
What's that?

757
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,053
It's Latin.

758
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:32,599
Ocularis Infernum. The Eye of Hell?

759
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:35,602
Very good.

760
01:05:35,643 --> 01:05:40,106
The Eye of Hell. I'm stuck in a glass house
with crazy white people...

761
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:41,191
Go on.

762
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:44,694
In hell, there is an eye
that sees everything, the past, the future...

763
01:05:44,777 --> 01:05:47,113
...heaven and earth,
the blessed, the damned.

764
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:50,700
If knowledge is power,
then the man who controls the Ocularis...

765
01:05:50,783 --> 01:05:53,036
...would be the most powerfuI
man on earth.

766
01:05:54,787 --> 01:05:55,872
Your uncle.

767
01:05:56,456 --> 01:05:57,624
Great.

768
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,626
So...

769
01:06:00,126 --> 01:06:03,213
...how many ghosts have been set free?

770
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:06,382
Eleven. And the house needs twelve.

771
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:10,470
No. Damon said something about thirteen.

772
01:06:10,803 --> 01:06:12,472
That there are thirteen ghosts.

773
01:06:12,597 --> 01:06:14,766
The thirteenth ghost is a faiI-safe.

774
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:19,938
To stop the process, the house needs
a sacrifice of life instead of death.

775
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:22,899
A willing, human sacrifice.

776
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:26,152
A sacrifice of the broken heart.

777
01:06:26,486 --> 01:06:29,489
The only ghost to be created
out of an act of pure love.

778
01:06:29,864 --> 01:06:31,658
You're the thirteenth ghost.

779
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:37,831
The thirteenth spirit stands before the eye
at the finaI configuration.

780
01:06:37,872 --> 01:06:40,875
As the eye opens,
the spirit uses the power of life...

781
01:06:41,334 --> 01:06:43,378
...to short-circuit the system.

782
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:46,172
Uses the power of life how?

783
01:06:46,548 --> 01:06:48,174
By leaping into the eye.

784
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:51,553
And Arthur's supposed to take this leap?
No fucking way, lady.

785
01:06:51,928 --> 01:06:54,514
That's suicide. I won't let you do it.

786
01:06:54,597 --> 01:06:58,268
You need to come up with something else.
That's not working.

787
01:06:59,018 --> 01:07:01,187
Love is the most powerfuI energy.

788
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:02,856
Meaning?

789
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:07,944
In order for you to save your children,
you must trade your life for theirs.

790
01:07:12,323 --> 01:07:13,867
Let me see this.

791
01:07:14,534 --> 01:07:16,452
There's got to be a better way.

792
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:19,330
I don't read Latin.

793
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:22,625
Well, we can try it the old-fashioned way,
my personaI favorite.

794
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:25,503
Nobody will be here
to brag about it afterwards.

795
01:07:25,587 --> 01:07:29,090
We need to come up with
a game plan soon. Time's running out.

796
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:31,426
Are you going to blow the place up?

797
01:07:31,551 --> 01:07:33,636
The last ghost is about to be released.

798
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:37,432
- I know why you feeI you have to do this.
- Get away from me.

799
01:07:37,515 --> 01:07:41,519
Psychics call it a "linking. "
We linked earlier. I saw everything...

800
01:07:42,061 --> 01:07:44,063
...about Jean, about you.

801
01:07:44,105 --> 01:07:47,817
Shut up.
I'm not going to listen to this from you.

802
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:50,361
Kalina is talking about suicide.

803
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:52,322
Whatever I have to do to save my kids.

804
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:55,575
It doesn't add up.
It doesn't make any sense.

805
01:07:55,617 --> 01:07:57,327
There's got to be a better way.

806
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:59,996
"Doesn't add up"?
What does add up here, Dennis?

807
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,540
How much of this equation
makes any sense at all?

808
01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:05,210
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

809
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:09,172
AII I can think about are my kids.

810
01:08:10,715 --> 01:08:12,884
I don't even know if they're alive.

811
01:08:15,345 --> 01:08:17,597
Then let's go out there and find out.

812
01:08:18,598 --> 01:08:21,684
One last time,
while there's still time, you and me.

813
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:34,030
Kalina...

814
01:08:34,113 --> 01:08:37,784
...no matter what I decide to do,
or what happens to any of us...

815
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:40,495
...are you sure
you can you stop that machine?

816
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:44,749
I've got enough explosives
to blow us back to the 15th century.

817
01:08:47,168 --> 01:08:48,461
Okay.

818
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:53,341
- How many flares do you have left?
- One, why?

819
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,260
We're going out again.

820
01:08:55,343 --> 01:08:58,888
No fucking way, Arthur.
You're going to get yourself killed.

821
01:08:59,305 --> 01:09:00,807
Not if we take that.

822
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:06,813
We got about ten minutes
untiI the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan.

823
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:11,317
Go.

824
01:09:13,486 --> 01:09:15,822
We'll go downstairs to try
and buy you some more time.

825
01:09:15,947 --> 01:09:17,949
After you, Captain America.

826
01:09:30,211 --> 01:09:32,630
Damn. I just got my nails done.

827
01:09:33,506 --> 01:09:35,175
Here. Put these on.

828
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:37,719
Come on, let's go!

829
01:10:12,378 --> 01:10:14,130
"There's no place like home. "

830
01:10:14,214 --> 01:10:17,383
"There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

831
01:10:17,592 --> 01:10:19,594
"There's no place like home. "

832
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:23,014
Knock it off, Dennis.
Just keep your eyes open.

833
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:27,018
I sure as hell hope I don't bleed to death.

834
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,063
That would suck.

835
01:10:32,106 --> 01:10:33,441
Rotate.

836
01:10:43,284 --> 01:10:45,078
Is that half the lawyer?

837
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:47,080
Here, take this. Move it.

838
01:10:47,121 --> 01:10:49,749
Oh, my God. He definitely looked better.

839
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:23,950
Oh, my God. Shit.

840
01:11:26,452 --> 01:11:27,745
GirI, hurry up!

841
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:58,610
- Ram him!
- He's swinging for the fences!

842
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:11,915
Kalina, get over here!
This flare shit ain't working! Hurry up!

843
01:12:46,616 --> 01:12:47,909
Where is it?

844
01:12:48,701 --> 01:12:51,037
Where is it?

845
01:12:51,538 --> 01:12:52,831
Kalina?

846
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:56,626
Why are you so mad at me?
I did everything you asked me to do.

847
01:12:56,751 --> 01:12:59,212
I killed Damon, I stole his spells.

848
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:02,298
I even made sure your pathetic
nephew didn't get himself killed!

849
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:03,758
Kalina!

850
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:07,303
Where are the spells?

851
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,519
You're not mad at me, are you?

852
01:13:16,813 --> 01:13:18,064
Of course not.

853
01:13:19,357 --> 01:13:21,568
- What is it?
- Oh, shit.

854
01:13:28,908 --> 01:13:30,660
There's only room for one of us back there.

855
01:13:30,743 --> 01:13:32,453
What are you doing?

856
01:13:32,745 --> 01:13:36,416
Don't worry about it, Arthur. I've been looking
for a reason to like myself for a long time.

857
01:13:36,457 --> 01:13:38,001
Dennis, don't do this!

858
01:13:38,084 --> 01:13:40,962
Hey, bro. You ain't nothing but a bitch!

859
01:13:43,673 --> 01:13:45,341
Dennis, no!

860
01:14:04,277 --> 01:14:05,653
Oh, my God.

861
01:14:57,539 --> 01:14:59,040
What do we do now?

862
01:14:59,123 --> 01:15:02,293
Your nephew believes
that sacrificing himself will save his kids.

863
01:15:02,377 --> 01:15:05,088
But he won't do it unless he's
convinced his kids are in jeopardy.

864
01:15:05,171 --> 01:15:07,757
- Well, put them in jeopardy.
- What?

865
01:15:09,509 --> 01:15:11,511
- Why not?
- But they're kids.

866
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:13,888
Greatness requires sacrifice.

867
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:17,684
Now, I have a job to do.

868
01:15:18,726 --> 01:15:20,270
And so have you.

869
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:24,816
Do it. Do it!

870
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:26,484
Yes.

871
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:33,199
And now to finish this.

872
01:16:29,631 --> 01:16:31,257
Oh, my God. Jean.

873
01:16:33,885 --> 01:16:35,720
I loved you so much.

874
01:16:38,306 --> 01:16:39,891
I miss you.

875
01:16:41,893 --> 01:16:43,478
Miss you.

876
01:16:44,604 --> 01:16:46,773
I'm nothing without you.

877
01:16:57,116 --> 01:17:00,286
Don't go.

878
01:17:00,495 --> 01:17:02,121
Don't go.

879
01:17:15,218 --> 01:17:17,095
Fetch the book.

880
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:30,150
Cyrus! What are you doing?

881
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:32,986
You just can't teach some people.

882
01:17:33,111 --> 01:17:37,448
I thought I told you,
greatness requires sacrifice.

883
01:17:46,332 --> 01:17:48,084
- Kathy!
- Bobby, don't look.

884
01:17:48,168 --> 01:17:50,336
I wanna look!

885
01:17:52,964 --> 01:17:55,133
Kathy, I'm scared!

886
01:17:59,095 --> 01:18:00,430
Kathy!

887
01:18:00,513 --> 01:18:02,307
Kathy! Bobby!

888
01:18:05,018 --> 01:18:06,102
Daddy!

889
01:18:06,352 --> 01:18:07,687
Bobby!

890
01:18:08,521 --> 01:18:10,356
Dad, help!

891
01:18:15,528 --> 01:18:16,905
Oh, my...

892
01:18:22,285 --> 01:18:25,538
Make it stop, Dad! Make it stop!

893
01:18:42,347 --> 01:18:45,350
This house is not a house. It is a machine...

894
01:18:48,394 --> 01:18:50,355
...designed by the devil...

895
01:18:51,564 --> 01:18:53,399
...and powered by the dead.

896
01:18:57,153 --> 01:19:01,282
According to Basileus, there should be
12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.

897
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:06,162
They represent the black zodiac.

898
01:19:08,414 --> 01:19:11,376
They represent the ghosts
that Cyrus needed to catch:

899
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:15,255
- The First-Born Son.
- One.

900
01:19:17,006 --> 01:19:18,675
- The Torso.
- Two.

901
01:19:19,008 --> 01:19:20,927
- The Bound Woman.
- Three.

902
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:22,762
- The Withered Lover.
- Four.

903
01:19:23,054 --> 01:19:24,722
The Torn Prince.

904
01:19:25,014 --> 01:19:27,475
The Angry Princess. The Pilgrimess.

905
01:19:27,517 --> 01:19:29,727
The Great Child and the Dire Mother.

906
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:33,773
The Hammer. The Jackal.
And The Juggernaut.

907
01:19:34,107 --> 01:19:35,567
Twelve.

908
01:19:42,574 --> 01:19:44,242
You're the thirteenth ghost.

909
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:50,957
If I'm the thirteenth...

910
01:20:06,806 --> 01:20:09,726
You son of a bitch!

911
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:15,815
Release my kids, you bastard!

912
01:20:20,111 --> 01:20:22,614
Damn you! You're nothing, Arthur!

913
01:20:23,031 --> 01:20:25,408
Do you hear? You loser!

914
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:28,161
I've dedicated my entire life to this.

915
01:20:28,369 --> 01:20:30,872
Every waking moment, for years.

916
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:34,834
Have you ever shown
that kind of dedication? Have you?

917
01:20:35,418 --> 01:20:38,922
The world has no time
for little people like you.

918
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:41,758
It needs people
who are willing to do anything!

919
01:20:43,343 --> 01:20:45,178
Anything for greatness.

920
01:20:49,933 --> 01:20:53,686
You don't have a choice this time, Arthur.

921
01:20:53,853 --> 01:20:55,730
You will make that leap.

922
01:20:57,649 --> 01:21:00,485
The machine requires
a ghost to be created...

923
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:02,862
...out of an act of pure love.

924
01:21:03,112 --> 01:21:06,533
That's why I chose you, nephew.
You and your pathetic family.

925
01:21:06,574 --> 01:21:08,284
Make it stop, Dad!

926
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:12,372
Congratulations,
you get to become the thirteenth ghost.

927
01:21:13,122 --> 01:21:14,582
Now, get on your feet!

928
01:21:19,128 --> 01:21:20,713
Come on!

929
01:22:26,779 --> 01:22:29,616
Trust me, Arthur. It's not over yet.

930
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:31,868
You can finish this.

931
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:36,206
You still have the power in you.

932
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:41,461
It's just a matter of how you use it.
Go to your kids. They need you.

933
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:52,597
Dad! Help!

934
01:22:53,973 --> 01:22:56,309
Daddy, don't! Don't do it!

935
01:23:04,484 --> 01:23:05,944
Oh, fuck!

936
01:23:12,033 --> 01:23:13,284
Dad!

937
01:23:23,044 --> 01:23:24,337
Don't move!

938
01:23:28,424 --> 01:23:29,926
Keep your heads down!

939
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:33,596
Hold on tight!

940
01:24:21,102 --> 01:24:22,687
Everybody okay?

941
01:24:25,315 --> 01:24:26,816
You okay?

942
01:24:29,569 --> 01:24:31,738
How did you know we'd be safe here?

943
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:34,532
I didn't.

944
01:24:34,741 --> 01:24:37,660
I just wasn't about to leave you guys.

945
01:24:38,244 --> 01:24:40,413
I love you both so much.

946
01:24:52,926 --> 01:24:54,219
Mom?

947
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:59,265
I love you guys.

948
01:25:05,605 --> 01:25:07,065
I love you.

949
01:25:19,702 --> 01:25:21,120
This is it for me.

950
01:25:21,162 --> 01:25:23,748
I am on the first fuckin' plane back to Newark.

951
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:28,878
I am sorry, family, Kathy,
Bobby, Uncle, ghosts...

952
01:25:29,087 --> 01:25:30,880
...I am sick of this nanny shit.

953
01:25:30,964 --> 01:25:34,759
I've had it.
This was not in the job description. I quit!
