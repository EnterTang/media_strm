1
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:41,990
l'm on the Clay Street platform. Got
a fare jumper. White male, shaved head, 20s.

2
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:43,855
Possible 10-13.

3
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:23,562
Officer Philbrick. All clear.

4
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:46,232
Deputy Chief Karras, Transit Police.
Lieutenant Bianco.

5
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:48,333
- You're Scully and Doggett?
- Yes.

6
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:52,507
- ls the assessment team here?
- Downstairs, waiting. Where have you been?

7
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:56,245
Agent Scully needed to examine
the body of the victim first.

8
00:03:56,352 --> 00:04:00,516
Who's missing the picture here? l got
lots of people can examine the body.

9
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,184
What l need from the FBl now is a time frame.

10
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:04,851
A time frame?

11
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:07,453
A main artery of the Boston transport system

12
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:10,794
has been closed for exactly
11 hours and four minutes.

13
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,028
My phone is ringing off the hook
with calls from the press.

14
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:17,869
l got 100,000 pissed-off commuters
who were late to work,

15
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:20,876
who will be even more pissed off
if they can't get home.

16
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:25,711
And l got one extremely pissed-off mayor
paying me to keep the damn trains running.

17
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:30,378
- We appreciate the pressure you're under...
- lt's you guys better kick it in the ass.

18
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:32,978
The afternoon rush starts in five hours.

19
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:36,786
Do what you gotta do, but the line
is going back into operation at 4pm.

20
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:39,157
- l'm afraid you can't do that.
- Yes, l can.

21
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:43,790
You've got a dead man who's got
over one third of his body tissue eaten away,

22
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,132
and until we figure out how and why,
that tunnel cannot be reopened.

23
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:51,172
We understand the FBl's need
to do an investigation,

24
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:54,937
but, as l see it,
the facts of this case are pretty simple.

25
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:57,172
- Simple?
- The train briefly lost power,

26
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,408
during which time
an assailant killed a Boston transit cop.

27
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,246
That man is still at large.

28
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:06,186
- An assailant using what?
- Acid? Lye?

29
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:10,589
- Your examination must've told you.
- No, it didn't. That's the thing.

30
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,855
Until we culture the tissue and run tests,

31
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,829
we won't know what killed him
or if it can infect others.

32
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:19,925
The Centers for Disease Control had
robotic sniffers in the tunnel all night.

33
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:23,632
They found no trace
of biological or chemical agents.

34
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,697
So let's clear this up.

35
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:31,178
What we're looking for is a man -
a cop killer. A single suspect.

36
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,115
At least, that's your cover story.
That's what you're telling the press.

37
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:40,349
The question is: can you get me the killer
or an explanation in five hours?

38
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:44,119
Cos, hell or high water,
the subway reopens at 4pm sharp.

39
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,218
Now let's go.

40
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:57,863
Steven Melnick. Transportation Authority's
chief structural engineer. He built this tunnel.

41
00:05:57,974 --> 00:06:03,674
l only oversaw construction of it four years
ago. l know every square inch down there.

42
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:07,807
Dr Hellura Lyle,
Special Pathogens Branch, CDC.

43
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:10,978
We were told the tunnel
was clear of pathogens.

44
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:14,922
Well, l guess l'm just here
for the moral support.

45
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,584
We're just covering our bases.

46
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:23,426
- What base are they covering?
- Agent Scully is a medical doctor,

47
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:27,731
who, they tell me, has a lot
of experience with equivocal death.

48
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:30,362
Equivocal?

49
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,204
l mean, you're dead or you're not, right?

50
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:38,270
Deaths which may have many explanations or
for which an explanation may be hard to find.

51
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:40,941
What about you?

52
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:44,112
- l'm just a good shot.
- Good.

53
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,123
Now that we're bosom buddies,
let's get this show on the road.

54
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:59,865
- You need some help with that?
- No.

55
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:03,372
- You're going in without me.
- What?

56
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,566
l don't know what games are being played

57
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:11,204
but l'm gonna be much more effective
analyzing the situation from up here.

58
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,272
Yeah, then l'm just a tagalong here.

59
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:17,648
This is your thing.
You've got all the experience.

60
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:20,745
You've got capable people with you,
Agent Doggett.

61
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:23,917
What l need down there
are eyes and ears.

62
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,161
OK.

63
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:38,103
l'll be your eyes and ears.

64
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,606
Only l wish someone would tell me what
the hell it is l'm supposed to be looking for.

65
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:15,376
Third rail's powering down.

66
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:19,510
You're clear to enter the subway floor.

67
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:22,106
As long as you stay on this line,

68
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:27,179
there should be no risk of
accidental shock or electrocution.

69
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:32,117
- You copy that, Agent Doggett?
- Yep. We're on the tunnel floor.

70
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:40,067
Hope you got yourself
a nice, clear picture, Agent Scully.

71
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:44,066
We got you every step of the way.

72
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:58,583
- lt feels like Atlanta in August.
- Yeah. lt's the middle of winter.

73
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:02,488
- How come it's so hot down here?
- They shut down ventilation last night.

74
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:07,552
Normally you have almost a million cubic feet
of fresh air per minute pushing through here.

75
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:09,563
But now we're in a sweatbox.

76
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:13,260
Aren't we lucky! Hot, sticky,
and crawling in the dark.

77
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:17,430
All so every commuter in Boston
can get home to watch Survivor ll.

78
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,000
l wonder why they shut down the ventilation
if it's a man we're looking for.

79
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:26,412
lf you doubt that so much,
Agent Doggett, why bring a gun?

80
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:52,203
Agent Doggett, you still reading me?

81
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:55,301
Like a songbird, Agent Scully.

82
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,748
- My neck. Get it off.
- What's going on?

83
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:02,079
- lt's burning.
- Hold still.

84
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:04,210
Whatjust happened?

85
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:07,916
He's got a burn on his neck,
silver-dollar size.

86
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:12,059
- You get seepage down here?
- Yeah, constantly.

87
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:17,293
This line was tunneled through landfill
adjacent to the harbor. Part of the Big Dig.

88
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,992
There was a puddle 20 yards back.

89
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:25,637
- You hear that, Agent Scully?
- Yeah. Ask Dr Lyle if she can get a sample.

90
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:29,642
- We need you to get a sample.
- OK. l'm on it.

91
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:35,407
Maybe it's not a man we're looking for,
but some sort of toxic leak.

92
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:40,088
We were told there are
no contaminants down here.

93
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:55,496
Tell her l'm sending this.

94
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:02,704
We're transmitting.

95
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:06,942
- You online, Agent Scully?
- Yeah, l got it.

96
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:09,610
l'm getting a reading.

97
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:14,782
Sample analysis is showing
carbon, bromide, boron and calcium.

98
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:18,323
lt's just sea water.

99
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:23,827
Let me get on the phone.
Maybe l can get a molecular analysis.

100
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,026
Four hours, Agent Scully.

101
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:34,399
Take it easy.

102
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,069
Agent Doggett.

103
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:40,838
What?

104
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:46,185
- What is it?
- There's somebody in the tunnel.

105
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:56,661
All right, let's go find him.

106
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:13,004
Open this line in four hours,
passengers'll get more than just a ride.

107
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:15,277
They'll get a steam bath to boot.

108
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:16,510
What are you doing?

109
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:22,524
lf this guy was gonna shoot me, he had
his chance. Besides, l'm sweatin' like a pig.

110
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:25,458
Mr Melnick, what's this?

111
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:29,622
lt's a tunnel from the old system.
Been shut down for years.

112
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:36,068
You see this, Agent Scully?
You have this on your graphic?

113
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,629
Yeah. lt's a fork in the line.

114
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:42,768
That line is obsolete.
lt's been gutted and decommissioned.

115
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:47,713
How far from here to where the train
lost power, Agent Scully?

116
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,781
lt's about a mile up the main tunnel.

117
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:55,818
He's gonna waste valuable time
going in there.

118
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:04,790
Agent Doggett?

119
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:12,168
- Agent Doggett.
- l'm just taking a look.

120
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:31,923
Let's get out of here.

121
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:35,797
Mr Melnick, what's your call?

122
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:40,199
ls there any good reason
to pursue this section?

123
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:42,270
Lots of places to hide in here.

124
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:45,000
- Dr Lyle?
- Agent Doggett, look out.

125
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:56,784
Agent Doggett, what happened?

126
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,781
Can you hear me?

127
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,618
Yeah.

128
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:08,724
No. Give me a minute.

129
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:14,526
What hit me?

130
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:17,572
He came at you like some kind of phantom.

131
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:19,800
What did?

132
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:23,034
Agent Doggett?

133
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,972
- Would you call that equivocal?
- Agent Scully?

134
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:34,520
OK, l see it.

135
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:39,552
- l'm gonna need some data.
- Agent Scully needs some data.

136
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:43,564
- l'm already on it.
- l think this guy killed Officer Philbrick.

137
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,861
l'm transmitting some photos.

138
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:50,167
Here comes your data, Agent Scully.

139
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,230
Oh, my God.

140
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:02,916
- Where are you goin'?
- l think l just saw something.

141
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:05,452
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem.

142
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:09,513
This man fits the description
called in by my transit cop.

143
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:13,619
We've found what we were looking for.
Let's get him wrapped up and go home.

144
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:17,956
See it? There's something on the floor.

145
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:35,212
Agent Scully,

146
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:37,878
we got bodies.

147
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:41,389
Looks like three males.

148
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:44,221
- Agent Scully?
- Yeah, l see 'em.

149
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:46,420
Can you get any closer?

150
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:48,986
The smell's a little overpowering.

151
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:52,895
They've been here for a while.

152
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:56,393
Someone wrapped 'em up
and stashed 'em here.

153
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:58,406
Can you get them uncovered?

154
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:04,070
They look like squatters,
from the way they're dressed.

155
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:07,640
l'm not sure l wanna touch these.

156
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:13,178
l see signs of the same tissue degradation
we saw in the other victims.

157
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:18,650
We may have a contagion here after all.

158
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:28,194
What did she say?

159
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:36,334
Dr Lyle. Down here.

160
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:44,844
CDC may be wrong.

161
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:52,660
Somebody's over here.

162
00:16:58,567 --> 00:16:59,795
Agent Doggett?

163
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,032
Whatever she saw...

164
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:12,071
- What did you see?
- Somebody out here just took off.

165
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:19,647
- l don't see where.
- We're done down here.

166
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:22,885
- Agent Doggett.
- Hold it, Lieutenant.

167
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:26,324
lf there's somebody else down there,
you need to find them.

168
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,863
What are you doing? Get those people out.

169
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:32,492
They found three dead bodies.
l want to know what happened to them.

170
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:35,401
They are in an obsolete,
decommissioned tunnel.

171
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:38,371
l'll get a crew down there tonight,
after rush hour.

172
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,671
They could be infected and contagious.

173
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:44,008
With what? Sea water?

174
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,012
You are being irrational here.

175
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:51,382
The CDC says there are no contaminants.
l'm gonna take their word on it.

176
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:54,581
Then who are those dead men
and how did they die?

177
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,252
Probably tunnel rats, squatters, attacked
by the same man who killed my transit cop.

178
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:03,297
Then take a look at the man who fits
the description of your killer, OK?

179
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:07,198
Just look at his injuries.
He died the same way.

180
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:12,866
There is something down there. l will not risk
bringing it up here until l figure out what it is.

181
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:15,474
- Agent Scully?
- Yeah?

182
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:18,068
What do you want us to do?

183
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:25,553
Leave those bodies where you found them
and go after whoever is in that tunnel.

184
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:31,490
We need to know
whether he is causing this,

185
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:34,619
or if he's infected himself.

186
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,494
Either way, he may kill more people.

187
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,124
l'm sure Dr Lyle will agree.

188
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:43,963
All right, we just got our order.

189
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:50,069
- We're gonna continue on.
- Says who?

190
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:51,976
Says the boss.

191
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:11,422
Agent Doggett.

192
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,663
This agent you work with
deals with weird stuff, right?

193
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:19,264
She works on something called the X-Files.
FBl cases of unexplained phenomena.

194
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,775
- You know her at all?
- Yeah, l know her.

195
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:24,540
We've worked together for a short time.

196
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:28,207
l wonder why she sent you down here
instead of coming herself.

197
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:30,376
lt's the right call.

198
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,113
You got a problem, Lieutenant?

199
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:39,650
Yeah, when somebody l don't know keeps me
down here in the dark looking forjack squat

200
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:41,628
when we've already found our man.

201
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:46,293
- lt's a question of contagion.
- lt's a question of who's in charge.

202
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:50,803
Agent Doggett?

203
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:53,569
- Yeah.
- You all right down there?

204
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:55,734
Fine.

205
00:19:57,212 --> 00:19:59,339
What have you got for us?

206
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:03,373
You're about 50 yards from the spot
where the train stopped.

207
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:07,214
What am l looking for?

208
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:10,416
l don't know.

209
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:15,360
Anything.

210
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:29,904
Get it off me.

211
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:33,743
- What is it?
- l don't know, but it burns.

212
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:36,443
- Just hold still. Let us see it.
- lt burns.

213
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:39,353
What is it? What's happening?

214
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:43,118
- Agent Doggett?
- l can't tell what it is.

215
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:47,927
Agent Scully, talk to me.

216
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:51,725
Yeah... Get some fresh water on it.

217
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,098
Give me water here.

218
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,102
What the hell was that?

219
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:04,940
l don't know, and l don't like it that you don't.
Agent Scully, talk to me.

220
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:09,279
l don't know what to say.
lt's something attacking the dermis.

221
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,249
Attacking? lt ate his arm off.

222
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,620
l hate to say this, but it looks like
some kind of biochemical weapon.

223
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:17,157
Great.

224
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,318
- What?
- What did she say?

225
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:22,556
She said a lot of people
might be taking cabs home tonight.

226
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,830
What the hell is this thing?

227
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:33,101
lt might be a terrorist
using a biochemical agent.

228
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:35,234
Might? ls she guessin'?

229
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:40,748
Agent Doggett, l pulled up a map
of the subway grid where you are now.

230
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,477
l want you to listen to me.

231
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:47,653
She says this tunnel
connects to another tunnel 100 yards up.

232
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:50,020
lt's the only place this guy could be hiding.

233
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,754
- This man ain't goin' nowhere.
- Then you take care of him.

234
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:56,320
l'll have a HAZMAT team come down here.

235
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:58,695
Lieutenant, let's go.

236
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,965
We're gonna get you out of here.
Come on.

237
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,270
l got you, buddy. Hang in there.

238
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,865
Dr Lyle.

239
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:36,460
- Dr Lyle, how are you feeling?
- Me?

240
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:40,304
l seem to be OK,
but Melnick is getting worse.

241
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,867
Vehicles are on the way.
The CDC doctors know of your conditions.

242
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,140
What are they gonna be treating us for?

243
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:50,207
- How are they gonna treat Melnick?
- l'm working on that.

244
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:06,359
What are you doing?

245
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:11,563
Where are you taking them?
Those bodies go to the CDC.

246
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:14,665
As a federal agent, l order you to stop.

247
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:19,339
Agent Scully, we are on a deadline here
which is fast approaching.

248
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:22,577
These bodies need immediate
examination and diagnosis.

249
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:25,847
- That is being arranged.
- By whom? l already arranged it.

250
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:35,019
- You knew those bodies were down there.
- Watch yourself, Agent Scully.

251
00:23:35,097 --> 00:23:36,894
Look at the way they're wrapped.

252
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:41,299
Somebody sealed them in plastic
hoping they wouldn't be found.

253
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:44,964
lf you sent my partner down there
knowing about this...

254
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:47,371
You are way out of line here.

255
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:50,970
l want to see inspection reports.

256
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:55,277
l want to know who was down there
in that tunnel and what they saw.

257
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:59,285
- l'll get you anything you want.
- Good.

258
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:03,653
Let's get these bodies to the CDC
where they're supposed to go.

259
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:26,406
- What's this here, Lieutenant?
- Abandoned station. Old stop.

260
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,414
Agent Scully.

261
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:37,485
Here we are, pissin' away our time,
and she's asleep at the wheel.

262
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:44,091
Come on, Agent Doggett. Make a decision.
Let's get out of here.

263
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:48,865
We gotta find whoever it is
that's still down here, Lieutenant.

264
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,133
And what if we don't find him?

265
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:56,974
Maybe it'll be us they find
lying face down on the floor, dead.

266
00:24:57,045 --> 00:25:00,344
Agent Scully knows what she's doing.

267
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:05,442
- This is about saving people's lives.
- lt looks like it's about saving her life.

268
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,048
lf she knows what she's doing,
why hasn't she figured it out yet?

269
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:12,149
Lieutenant...

270
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:16,493
- Walk towards me.
- What?

271
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:21,995
What, damn it?

272
00:25:29,978 --> 00:25:31,809
The stuff's on me.

273
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,973
You see that? lt's spreading.

274
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:37,316
l told you we should've gotten out.

275
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:39,819
That's exactly why we gotta stay.

276
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:43,223
You saw. You saw what it does.

277
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:45,520
Yeah, l saw what it did.

278
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:49,553
But l don't see it having any other
effect on you, so just calm down.

279
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:53,896
No. l'm gettin' out of here. l'm leavin'.

280
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:15,389
- You'd do it, wouldn't you?
- Not because l want to.

281
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:17,550
But you're pushin' pretty hard.

282
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:22,461
So put your weapon down,
Lieutenant, right now.

283
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:38,876
Now, we're gonna get out of here,
but we're gonna wait for the OK.

284
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:48,388
Agent Doggett, can you...

285
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:55,960
Come in, Agent Doggett.

286
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,226
Come in, damn it.

287
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:07,272
ls this a bad time?

288
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:09,742
Excuse me?

289
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:13,076
l don't know. l'm looking for
an FBl agent, Dana Scully.

290
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:16,515
- Do you know where l can find him?
- No. Yes. l mean, l'm she.

291
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:18,848
- Can l help you?
- Yes. l'm Dr Kai Bowe.

292
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:22,855
l was sent a scribbled note
and a saltwater sample for analysis.

293
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:25,255
l'm a marine biologist from BU.

294
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:29,161
l'm sorry. Yes. Dr Bowe, please.

295
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:34,966
- Did you get an analysis?
- Yes. l have something to show you.

296
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,007
l'm going to assume you're in a hurry.

297
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:45,840
This is an image
taken from a stereomicroscope

298
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:48,177
of what's called a medusa.

299
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:50,513
Your saltwater sample was deceiving.

300
00:27:50,618 --> 00:27:54,782
lts components are as you'd expect,
except for higher levels of calcium.

301
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:57,450
This creature is primarily that.

302
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:59,186
- Calcium?
- Yes.

303
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:02,991
lt's what powers its movement
and gives it bioluminescence.

304
00:28:03,064 --> 00:28:05,692
So you're saying that this is a sea creature.

305
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:10,805
- Which is why the CDC missed it.
- Well, it's hard to find.

306
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:14,000
l dare say l'm not even sure
if it's of the sea, but...

307
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:17,169
wherever it's from, it's quite incredible.

308
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:21,174
lt's killing people.

309
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:24,415
- How?
- l don't know.

310
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,478
There is sea water in that tunnel,
and it's eating people's flesh off.

311
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:32,652
lt's producing some kind of a reaction
that looks almost electrical.

312
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:37,494
- On contact?
- No. Something triggers it.

313
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:41,995
- Have you been in the tunnel?
- No, l have not.

314
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:46,063
But my partner is down there,
and l fear the worst.

315
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:54,573
Anybody out there?

316
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:01,847
Somebody.

317
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:04,357
Anybody hear me?

318
00:29:04,426 --> 00:29:06,417
Anybody?

319
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:51,496
Agent Doggett, can you hear me?

320
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:57,836
Yeah.

321
00:29:59,914 --> 00:30:02,747
l'm here. l hear you.

322
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,355
God, you frightened me.
l started fearing the worst.

323
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:14,985
No, l got blindsided by...

324
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:19,359
l don't see Lieutenant Bianco.

325
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:24,461
He's infected with something.
l saw it glowin' on his skin.

326
00:30:26,474 --> 00:30:29,932
And what's your condition, Agent Doggett?

327
00:30:37,952 --> 00:30:39,817
l'm gonna assume it's not good.

328
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:50,529
l'm gonna send a quarantine unit down to get
you. l want you to stay right where you are.

329
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:53,965
l appreciate it, but l can't do that.

330
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:58,164
lf we're gonna stop the spread of this thing,

331
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,537
l gotta stop Lieutenant Bianco.

332
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:07,678
Dr Bowe, l need you to get on the phone
with the CDC. Tell them everything we know.

333
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:12,049
We have to learn as quickly as possible
what sets this thing off.

334
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:18,652
Look, l need you to blockade
any and every exit from this system.

335
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:21,092
You've got a possible outbreak situation.

336
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:24,028
- That's not going to happen.
- No, you listen to me.

337
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:28,364
Your lieutenant is infected and at large
in the system, looking for a way out.

338
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:30,028
l hear you.

339
00:31:30,104 --> 00:31:34,040
lt's just that there are already
passengers waiting on the platform.

340
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:46,216
Agent Doggett,

341
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:48,414
we've got a new wrinkle.

342
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:51,851
Don't tell me.

343
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:54,360
We're running out of time. lt's 20 to four.

344
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:59,093
- l'm moving as fast as l can.
- You shouldn't be moving at all.

345
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,365
ln 20 minutes l'll be taking a long bath
at the hotel. Right now, l gotta find this guy.

346
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:09,206
This organism that's on your skin,
something triggers it, and l don't know what.

347
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:11,871
lt could be body temperature or heart rate.

348
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:14,414
lt could be from standin' still too, right?

349
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:19,215
Maybe the only thing keeping me from
sparkin' up right now is that l'm movin'.

350
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:21,721
Yeah. l guess you're right.

351
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,925
l'm gettin' out of this thing, Agent Scully.

352
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:29,726
Just make sure Karras holds those trains
till l find Bianco.

353
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:34,825
He's got passengers
waiting at the next station.

354
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:38,428
You tell that son of a bitch
he's gotta clear the system. He's...

355
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:42,075
Wait. l see something.

356
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:52,613
Lieutenant...

357
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:55,121
He's hurt.

358
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:08,867
You see this, Dr Bowe?

359
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:12,931
You see this, Mr Karras?

360
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:27,878
You got the CDC? l need anything they can
give me about what sets this organism off.

361
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:30,981
An idea, a notion, a wild guess.

362
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:36,994
Agent Scully, what do you want me to do?

363
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:40,694
Get out of there, Agent Doggett.

364
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:43,460
What about this man?

365
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:47,133
l'm gonna send a HAZMAT team down
for him, but from what l've seen...

366
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,142
the reaction's progressive.

367
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,805
Please, Agent Doggett, don't leave me here.

368
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:01,681
l hope you enjoy the ride.

369
00:34:04,892 --> 00:34:07,884
See this, Agent Scully?

370
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:10,325
Yeah.

371
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,266
- Who else is down there?
- We don't know.

372
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:17,033
You there. Stop.

373
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:20,398
Federal agent. l'm armed.

374
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:42,195
Agent Scully, you believe this?

375
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:51,632
Who are you? What's your name?
What are you doin' down here?

376
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:54,264
What's he pointing at?

377
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:56,235
l don't know.

378
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,212
- ls he infected?
- Agent Doggett, turn the light away.

379
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:04,978
Nothing. He's unaffected.

380
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:12,249
- How's that?
- l think l just figured it out.

381
00:35:13,628 --> 00:35:16,256
l might know what triggers this.

382
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,992
- What is it?
- Sweat.

383
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:25,300
Perspiration is a conductor for calcium ions,
promoting a chemical-electrical reaction.

384
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:28,139
- Electricity?
- That's right.

385
00:35:28,242 --> 00:35:32,440
The boy's sweat glands aren't fully
developed, so he wouldn't be as conductive.

386
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:34,743
Just my luck.

387
00:35:37,118 --> 00:35:41,851
- Agent Doggett, where is he going?
- l don't know, but he wants me to follow him.

388
00:35:58,673 --> 00:36:04,202
Agent Scully, l don't know if you can see this.
l think l found the source of the contagion.

389
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:12,950
Looks like a big leak in the ceiling is
crumbling the walls, flooding into the system.

390
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,784
lt must have seeped in from the bay.

391
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:19,952
Where are you goin'?

392
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:23,963
You see this? The kid's
walkin' right through this stuff.

393
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,166
Yeah. l'm checking my graphic here.

394
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:33,674
lt looks like he's trying to lead you
through to a tunnel on the main system.

395
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:38,804
And if this is accurate, it would put you
about 400 yards from an access point.

396
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,340
lf l could put a HAZMAT team together, we
might be able to have you out in 15 minutes.

397
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:52,649
Come on, Lieutenant.

398
00:37:11,245 --> 00:37:15,341
We're through to the main system,
Agent Scully. We got big problems here.

399
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:16,610
Yes, we do.

400
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:20,050
- You see this floodin'?
- No, it's worse than that.

401
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:24,922
l think this moron Karras
has started the trains rolling.

402
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,451
Agent Doggett, what are you doing?

403
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:06,733
Get off the tracks, Agent Doggett.
Get out of there.

404
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:10,897
We got people on the train.
They could get infected.

405
00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:14,737
Get out of there, Agent Doggett.

406
00:38:15,843 --> 00:38:18,403
Give it to me.

407
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:20,777
l got an idea, Agent Scully.

408
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:35,788
Agent Doggett?

409
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:38,528
Talk to me, Agent Doggett.

410
00:38:40,368 --> 00:38:43,633
Agent Doggett? Are you there?

411
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:45,695
Can you hear me?

412
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:49,435
Yeah, l'm here.

413
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:53,309
Thank God.

414
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,212
l lost you on the visual.

415
00:39:02,456 --> 00:39:03,855
OK.

416
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:07,121
OK, l've got you. You're back.

417
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:41,354
Are you OK?

418
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:48,164
l can only hope, Agent Scully.

419
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:16,920
Nurse.

420
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:26,736
Where do you think you're going?

421
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:32,302
To find the nurse. She said she was gonna
talk to the doctor about me goin' home.

422
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:34,711
l could be dyin' in here
for all she knows.

423
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:37,717
Well, you're not, Agent Doggett.

424
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:44,447
Your skin and body are rid of the organism.
A simple alcohol bath cleaned you right up.

425
00:40:44,558 --> 00:40:48,392
l was just down talking to the nurse and...

426
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:51,625
l told her l'd come and give you the news.

427
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:53,723
Well, can l get outta here?

428
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:55,894
Yes.

429
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:06,446
What about the others?

430
00:41:06,514 --> 00:41:10,075
Well, the kid is with Social Services.

431
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:13,348
Plastic surgeons are working
on Melnick and Bianco.

432
00:41:13,454 --> 00:41:16,855
And Dr Lyle has been discharged.

433
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:22,092
You know, l'd like to think that this is over.

434
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:26,259
But there's gonna be hell to pay
for these guys.

435
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:29,769
No, it's over, Agent Doggett.

436
00:41:29,837 --> 00:41:31,361
Excuse me?

437
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:34,805
This guy Karras put a train back on the tracks.

438
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:39,505
- He recklessly endangered people's lives.
- But there is no proof of that.

439
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:44,849
What do you mean, there's no proof?

440
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,485
What l'm saying is that the organism
is no longer extant.

441
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:54,790
- lt's destroyed.
- By what?

442
00:41:54,862 --> 00:41:59,060
l'm guessing by the electrical charge
that you set off.

443
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:10,704
We got victims. Dead bodies.

444
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:13,905
lnfected by a pathogen of unknown etiology.

445
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:22,178
Look, Agent Doggett,
not a criminal charge is gonna stick.

446
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:29,253
These guys were just doing theirjob.

447
00:42:29,363 --> 00:42:31,831
Keeping the trains running.

448
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:40,566
But they've got you to thank.

449
00:42:43,544 --> 00:42:47,173
And notjust for saving their butts.

450
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:49,674
No. You figured it out.

451
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:55,188
l was just your eyes and ears.

452
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,054
Agent Scully...

453
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:07,758
Let's go home.

454
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:44,102
