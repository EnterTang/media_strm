1
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,423
Happy, stop that.

2
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,024
Hap.

3
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,093
What's with her all of a sudden?

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,870
- Don't you look at my letters.
- For God's sakes.

5
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,866
Read 'em and weep, my dear.

6
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,200
Seven letters.

7
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,399
50 bonus points.

8
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,149
Darren.

9
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,393
- Get in the basement.
- What are you gonna do?

10
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,989
Just do what l say.

11
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,963
l got a gun.

12
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,632
Stop.

13
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,698
Sorry. l didn't mean to scare you.

14
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,310
They told me l'd find you inside.

15
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:18,646
l was out back,
talking to the detective in charge.

16
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,983
You're the expert. Everyone's waiting
to hear what you have to say on this.

17
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,750
What do we know?

18
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:29,318
Darren and Evelyn Mountjoy.
Married 32 years, three kids, five grandkids.

19
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:34,731
Not an enemy in the world.
That's their dog out front. Neck's broken.

20
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,669
From the footprints in the mud,
best guess is we're looking for two perps.

21
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,070
Nothing stolen from the house.
Nothing to suggest motive.

22
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:47,443
lt all fits a profile.
This thing is staged to look like satanic ritual.

23
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:52,416
Placing victims
in a murder-suicide posture is ritualistic.

24
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,784
And this word is undoubtedly satanic.

25
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,789
''Daemonicus?''

26
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,155
lt means ''Satan'' in Latin.

27
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,922
Or daemonicus - demon possession.

28
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,430
And it's worth 50 extra points.

29
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:14,466
That's why they were posed like this, so we'd
think that these folks were possessed, right?

30
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,134
That would be the textbook explanation.

31
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:23,509
- l'll let 'em know.
- This may be something else.

32
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,513
Which is what?

33
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:36,560
Say anything you want about satanic ritual,
but don't tell me you think the devil did this.

34
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:41,463
Cos we got prints on the lawn out there.
This case ain't even close to being an X-File.

35
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:46,062
Something strange happened in here
just before you came in. l can't explain it.

36
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,672
What?

37
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:16,264
Dr Dana Scully.

38
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:24,768
l have just been assigned to the Academy
as a forensic investigator.

39
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:29,541
For the past eight years l was
part of a unit known as the X-Files.

40
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:37,017
- Some of you may have heard of it.
- Did you ever slay a vampire?

41
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:43,260
Sorry to disappoint you,
but this is a course in forensic pathology.

42
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,922
Hard science.

43
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:51,026
An X-File is a case that has been
deemed unsolvable by the Bureau.

44
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:56,405
Because such a case cannot be solved,
it may beg other explanations.

45
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,206
A vampire, perhaps.

46
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:07,113
Science, however, tells us that evil comes
not from monsters but from men.

47
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,883
lt offers us the methodology
to catch these men.

48
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,723
And only after
we have exhausted these methods

49
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:22,428
should we leave science behind
to consider more extreme possibilities.

50
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,026
What'd you find?

51
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:01,596
l asked Agent Scully for her expertise on this.
Looks like we can rule out The Exorcist.

52
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,507
And why is that?

53
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,377
There's adhesive residue
on Mrs Mountjoy's wrists and face.

54
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,973
Can you see that?

55
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:18,848
She was taped and bound and then shot at a
range of 10-12ft with her husband's handgun.

56
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,188
The husband shot her.

57
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,391
He was tricked into it.

58
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,467
That's what we were thinking.
Some kind of sick game.

59
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:35,633
There's also evidence of
fingerprint bruising along his collarbone.

60
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,842
They held him down.

61
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:45,145
- Shot him in his chair.
- Again we're looking for two guys.

62
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,015
The snakes appear to be purely symbolic.

63
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,579
They're a nonvenomous species
collected locally.

64
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:56,424
They were sewn postmortem
into the body cavity with household thread

65
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,829
by someone who appears
to have surgical skill.

66
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,663
You've made a lot of headway.

67
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,702
But there's something else.

68
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,402
There's something that you're not saying.

69
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,673
When l was alone in that house this morning,

70
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,513
l had the strong feeling
l was in the presence of evil.

71
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:26,552
We were called in on this because
you've investigated hundreds of these cases.

72
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,892
And not once did l find
any evidence of genuine satanic activity.

73
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,726
l'm sayin'...

74
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,198
l've never felt this before.

75
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,570
Excuse me.

76
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,600
John Doggett.

77
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,472
Agent Scully, have you ever sensed
what l'm talking about?

78
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,485
l've felt things that l couldn't understand.

79
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,886
Things l was afraid to admit even to myself.

80
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,254
And what did you do?

81
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,454
l learned not to ignore it.

82
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,426
To trust my instincts.

83
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,236
Yeah. Thank you.

84
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,895
What is it?

85
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:17,807
A mental hospital, a hundred miles from here.
They think one of their patients did this.

86
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,119
We're pretty shaken up.
We're trying to determine how he escaped.

87
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:10,151
Why do you think this patient, Kenneth
Richman, was involved in these murders?

88
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,323
Dr Richman was committed
cos he killed three patients.

89
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,200
He sewed strychnine into their stomachs
in surgery. When l heard about the snakes...

90
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:22,331
The police believe two men
committed this crime, Dr Sampson.

91
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,673
- Two men?
- Any idea who the second man might be?

92
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,744
No. He didn't exactly keep pen pals.

93
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:34,309
Did Dr Richman display any knowledge of
satanic lore or speak of demonic possession?

94
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:39,153
No. He was perfectly cogent. He didn't
suffer from those kinds of delusions.

95
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,716
l'm not really asking about delusions.

96
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,324
When you last spoke to him,
did he seem himself?

97
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,525
''Seem himself?''

98
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,263
Did he display a personality
other than his own?

99
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,204
Speak in tongues
or in a language he didn't know?

100
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,677
You're asking me if he was possessed?
This is the 21st century, Ms Reyes.

101
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:04,045
We stopped looking a long time ago
for demons to explain mental illness.

102
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,085
l'm not really talking about mental illness.

103
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,584
Excuse me a moment.

104
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,393
You know, Monica,
a room here just came open.

105
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,907
You heard what she said. Dr Richman didn't
know anything about satanic ritual.

106
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,703
That proves he was possessed?

107
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,439
Explain how else he commits a crime
that's a perfect example of it.

108
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,778
Let's try the obvious.
lt was his accomplice.

109
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:43,822
Agents, l think the man you're looking for
might be Paul Gerlack.

110
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,723
- ls he a patient here?
- No. He's a guard.

111
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,956
He's been with us 12 years
and no one can find him.

112
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:55,056
Who would be the last person
who saw them together?

113
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,869
Mr Kobold?

114
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:13,343
My name is John Doggett.
This is Monica Reyes. We're with the FBl.

115
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:25,315
The patient in the cell next to yours escaped
last night. Did you see or hear anything?

116
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:31,591
You shared the same guard. Do you know
anything about their relationship?

117
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,825
Why he would have helped him to escape?

118
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:41,434
You mean, did the guard
force the patient to escape?

119
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,065
Or did the patient force the guard?

120
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,503
Or are they both of one mind?

121
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:53,417
Like a snake, eating its own tail.

122
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,680
You know something about this?

123
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:04,754
lf you do, we need your help
to stop them before they hurt more people.

124
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,528
You're too late for that.

125
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,232
lf you're afraid to help us, we can protect you.
No harm will come to you.

126
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,106
Do you believe in the power of the devil?

127
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,614
l believe that the devil's
a story made up to scare people.

128
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,387
Then how can you possibly protect me?

129
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,593
Consider the source.

130
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:44,121
He's been calling for Agent Doggett
for an hour. He's extremely agitated.

131
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,663
Has he said why?

132
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:50,134
He keeps saying ''prince of the apostles.''
l don't know what it means.

133
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:55,401
l had to restrain him. l thought it best
not to sedate him till you speak to him.

134
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,917
- lt's John Doggett.
- He's speaking to me.

135
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,419
Whispering in my ear.

136
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,820
What's he saying to you?

137
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,986
He's killed again.

138
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,990
- Who?
- l don't know.

139
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,662
But l can show you.

140
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:11,811
You can't know what it feels like, being free
of that cage, to see the sky above me.

141
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,647
Where is he?

142
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,320
There. l can take you.

143
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:27,387
That's far enough.
Take him back to his cage now. Agent Reyes?

144
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,397
- Think he's makin' it up?
- Yeah.

145
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,939
That was a convincing show back there.

146
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,946
He's play-acting.
Just cos he's good at it doesn't make it true.

147
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,982
Then why do it?

148
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:49,645
He wants some fresh air. Maybe he gets off
sending the FBl on snipe hunts.

149
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,155
l don't think that's it.

150
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,440
lt's the security guard. Paul Gerlack.

151
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:23,320
lt appears he was shot in the chest. His body
was staged postmortem, just like the others.

152
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,154
- Someone likes to play games.
- Or not.

153
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,686
''Prince of the apostles.''
Kobold kept repeating it in his cell.

154
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,460
Saint Peter. He was said
to have been crucified upside down.

155
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:39,300
A symbol adopted by Satanists
to mark the power of the Antichrist.

156
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:44,832
You see that as proof the devil possessed the
surgeon and put him in touch with Kobold?

157
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,674
lt's part of the literature.

158
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:53,844
He could be a medium, a willing host
for Satan, communicating with Kobold.

159
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,582
- That's convenient.
- He brought up the devil and the snakes.

160
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:02,490
- No one told him the details, but he knew.
- That's cos he planned it.

161
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:07,931
l pulled his file. He's a master manipulator.
He was a professor at the University of Miami,

162
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:13,528
committed for grinding up six
coeds that he tricked into his basement.

163
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,336
He used their flesh as fertilizer in his garden.

164
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:23,572
lf Kobold's part of this, why is he still behind
bars? Why not escape when he had chance?

165
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,516
l don't know yet.

166
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,950
You believe this guy, Agent Scully?

167
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,355
l haven't formed an opinion about it yet,
actually.

168
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,795
That's great. Just great.

169
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,590
Where are you going?

170
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:47,195
This man Kobold can help us.
l'm gonna prove it to you.

171
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,663
- Professor...
- You found the body.

172
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,461
Yes.

173
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:21,403
Professor Kobold, we need your help to find
him before anyone else gets hurt.

174
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,169
- l can't.
- You can't or you won't?

175
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:29,270
l can't... in here.

176
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:36,319
He whispers to me in a thousand voices,
but they're so hard to hear.

177
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,816
What can we do to help you hear?

178
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,992
l need a larger room.

179
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,593
One with space.

180
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,437
And windows to see the sky.

181
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:08,715
You're not going along with this?
Giving him what he wants?

182
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,653
- That was my general idea.
- You're makin' a mistake.

183
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:16,126
Even if you're right,
even if this man is faking it, he can help us.

184
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:20,790
l'm not willing to turn my back on that.
Are you?

185
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,761
This is Officer Custer.

186
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:58,996
- He's gonna keep an eye on you.
- l'm familiar with Officer Custer.

187
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,063
l'm right outside the door
if you need anything, Professor.

188
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:07,069
Agent Reyes believes me.
But you don't, Mr Doggett.

189
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,843
- lt doesn't matter what l believe.
- l'm wondering...

190
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:18,917
why a skeptic such as yourself would accept
assignment to an obscure unit of the FBl

191
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:24,291
devoted exclusively to the investigating
of paranormal phenomena.

192
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,591
Been checkin' up on me?

193
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:30,395
Men don't pursue occupations
against their own inclination

194
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,462
unless there's some strong
countervailing reason.

195
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,770
Seeking the love or approval
of a woman, perhaps.

196
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:43,109
Agent Reyes may have affection for you,
but you for her?

197
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:47,716
Of course, it could be someone else.
Or something else.

198
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:52,314
- Some dark secret from your past.
- That's enough.

199
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,757
An unsolved tragedy
for which you feel responsible.

200
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,319
ln some morbid way
you haven't even admitted to yourself,

201
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:06,234
perhaps you feel that chasing ghosts
will answer the questions which damn you.

202
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:11,565
l don't have time for this.
Tell me if he says anything.

203
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,736
Agent Doggett?

204
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,512
Agent Reyes.

205
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,678
Get Agent Reyes.

206
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,952
- He's saying something.
- Medicus.

207
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,690
Medicus.

208
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:08,129
Physician.

209
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,545
Dr Sampson!

210
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,559
John.

211
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,678
Dr Sampson?

212
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:49,323
The syringes contained droperidol, the same
anti-psychotic drug she gave Dr Richman.

213
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:54,839
- He's not the one calling the shots.
- You still think that it was Kobold?

214
00:27:55,573 --> 00:28:00,840
This is not about demons. lt's not about
demonic possession. lt's about men.

215
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,278
Have you considered that
something else might be going on?

216
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:09,309
l heard you say it.
l heard you tell a classroom full of FBl cadets.

217
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,754
Most evil in the world comes from men.

218
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:18,091
But l also said that when science fails
we have to consider extreme possibilities.

219
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,943
l know what you're feeling.

220
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,946
l know your frustration.

221
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:39,814
But you can't let it cloud your objectivity.

222
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:46,312
Agent Reyes is thinking just what this guy
Kobold wants her to think. Now you are too.

223
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,740
Professor, are you done with this meal?

224
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,664
l brought you something.
Something to read.

225
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:40,334
lt's a monograph you wrote six years ago.

226
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,505
You know the one l'm talking about?

227
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:48,245
About the influence of Satan
in Renaissance thinking.

228
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,420
So you've found your proof.

229
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,632
Circumstantial though it may be.

230
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:07,970
You planned this whole thing.
l wanna know why.

231
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:15,244
- l've been thinking a lot about you.
- You're not answering my question.

232
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:20,876
About why someone so ill-suited would draw
this duty. Clearly you have feelings for her.

233
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,386
You ordered Dr Richman to kill these people.

234
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:27,288
But you can't compete
with the long-lost Agent Mulder.

235
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:31,624
- His easy good looks, his Oxford education...
- This is about you.

236
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,924
Mulder has what you can't have.

237
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:39,095
But you stumble forward, the flat-footed cop,
thinking he can put handcuffs on a demon.

238
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,832
- Answer the question!
- You want her.

239
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,636
But she feels sorry for you.

240
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,640
They both do.

241
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,665
Guard.

242
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,256
Guard, we need a medic.

243
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,696
Guard.

244
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,136
We need a medic. Guard.

245
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,635
She's coming.

246
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:51,806
- As far as l can tell, physically he's fine.
- Course he is.

247
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,743
What brought this on?

248
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:58,247
The guy's an expert in satanic history.
l confronted him on it.

249
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,977
- Which proves what?
- Come on.

250
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:05,751
You wanted to know who could stage a
textbook example. He wrote the damn book.

251
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:09,691
l can't explain those voices
we heard in his room. Or this.

252
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,229
- lt's a trick.
- What if it's ectoplasm?

253
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,195
Ectoplasm?

254
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:18,929
- You've heard of it, Agent Scully?
- Agent Mulder used to call it psychic plasma.

255
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:22,495
A residual by-product
of telepathic communication.

256
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:26,270
lt would have inorganic properties
that couldn't be explained.

257
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,436
What are we talking?
The Ghost Busters?

258
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,539
lf l'm right, analysis of this
could prove whether he's telling the truth.

259
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:37,520
You can throw that crap away, cos l can tell
you this guy's a liar. He's playing a game.

260
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,921
Let's just see how well he plays that game.

261
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,426
Why? So you can get suckered in even more?
Listen to you two.

262
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,860
Agent Doggett...

263
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:51,596
This guy threw this stuff up for our benefit.
He knew what you'd say and what l'd say.

264
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:56,970
He knew you would be so blinded by this
you wouldn't see what's in front of your faces.

265
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:01,375
Agent Reyes is just
trying to get to the truth, OK?

266
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:04,381
What are you doing?

267
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,081
Maybe this is a hoax.
Maybe you're right.

268
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,291
But you want us to turn away from evidence?
lt's not like you. l don't understand why.

269
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,391
l already told you why.

270
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,273
Scully.

271
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:17,575
- l tried to reach you at Quantico.
- l'm on my way back to DC. What is it?

272
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:21,345
Kobold told the guard he knows
where he can find Dr Richman to end this.

273
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,886
Where?

274
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:29,860
That's just it. lt sounds like ajoke, another
game. lt's a place called Happy Landing.

275
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:31,750
Scully?

276
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:37,026
- On the State Road 710, near Annandale.
- What are you talkin' about?

277
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:41,367
There's an old marina there. l pass it
on my way home. l'm almost there now.

278
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,806
State Road 710 near Annandale.

279
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,537
We're gonna meet you there.

280
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,367
Where is she?

281
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,837
l don't know. But l know who does.

282
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,681
- Where is she, Professor?
- Game's over.

283
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,848
Tell me where she is right now
or l swear l'll kill you where you sit.

284
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,652
You've lost.

285
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,818
Where is she?

286
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,638
- Agent Scully?
- Agent Doggett.

287
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,145
Over here.

288
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,550
l don't understand.

289
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:45,055
He held me at gunpoint until you arrived
and then he shot himself.

290
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:48,250
lt doesn't make sense.

291
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,124
Yes, it does.

292
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,458
The game's over.

293
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,243
Joseph Kobold! Stop there.

294
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,768
l am armed and l will shoot.

295
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:38,669
Uncertainty. No matter how thorough the
investigation, some doubts inevitably remain.

296
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:43,042
Just as juries seek to convict
beyond a reasonable doubt,

297
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:49,017
the forensic investigator seeks conclusions
supported by a preponderance of evidence.

298
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:54,285
Rarely will you encounter a case
where all of the variables,

299
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,384
all of the open questions are fully answered.

300
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,998
l'll see you Monday.

301
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:20,378
Have you filed your report on this case yet?

302
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:24,011
- l was gonna do it on my way home.
- We'd rather you didn't.

303
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:28,087
We haven't accounted for Kobold's actions.
Not all of them.

304
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:33,858
Agent Reyes said Kobold found information
about us on the lnternet. About Mulder too.

305
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,059
That explains how he knew
we'd respond to the killings,

306
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,160
why he staged them to look like satanic ritual.

307
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:45,504
- He wanted us on the case. We know that.
- He bent everyone to do whatever he wanted.

308
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:53,275
But we know all this already. lt was a game.
Every move was played out perfectly.

309
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,683
- Except the last one.
- Unless that was part of the game too.

310
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,587
- To get shot in the back?
- No.

311
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,215
Kobold's body still hasn't been found.

312
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:07,390
Kobold's dead.
Agent Doggett shot him. We all saw that.

313
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:12,459
Did we? Think back to
Agent Reyes's question.

314
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:17,365
Why didn't Kobold escape with the others
when he had the chance?

315
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:22,435
Why? Because he wanted to escape
without anybody knowing that he'd escaped.

316
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:27,415
So that by the time it was discovered,
he'd be too far away for anyone to find him.

317
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,747
Satan.

318
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:33,756
Daemonicus:
the beginning and end of our case.

319
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,952
A snake eating its own tail.

320
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,224
We lost. Kobold told me so.

321
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:46,327
He wanted us to see how brilliantly
he played the game, how thoroughly we lost.

322
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,741
The first victims,
Darren and Evelyn Mountjoy.

323
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,681
Chosen from the phone book.
For what reason?

324
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,688
No reason, other than their names.

325
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:11,958
- And the third victim.
- The doctor.

326
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,327
Monique Sampson.

327
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:22,304
And the last. The man whose body
is at the bottom of that river.

328
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,869
lt's not Kobold?

329
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,379
The guard we assigned him.

330
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:35,680
The guard he knew he'd have
once we transferred him.

331
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,780
Custer.

332
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,689
Checkmate.

333
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,047
Something's still bothering you.

334
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,015
You don't believe his explanation?

335
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,648
lt all makes sense to me as far as it goes.

336
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:19,823
But there's something else.
Something he's afraid to explain.

337
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:24,197
You mean that you felt the presence of evil?

338
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,835
No.

339
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,041
l mean that he felt it too.

340
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,441
