1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,037
Yeah, dudes. Welcome to your Dumb Ass
Show. l am your Sky Commander Winky.

2
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:14,375
- And this is the beautiful Captain Dare.
- Yeah, baby.

3
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:18,542
- The biggest dumb-ass l know.
- Thank you, Sky Commander.

4
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:22,178
Captain Dare will show you
what a dumb-ass he really is.

5
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:27,851
But be forewarned. Only a stupid dumb-ass
would neglect to take every safety precaution

6
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:31,453
in the stunts you are about to witness.

7
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:36,969
Now, the physics alone took
almost five minutes of calculation.

8
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,974
Yeah, dude. Fire when ready.

9
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:52,173
Oh, mother... What the...

10
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,752
And that's a dumb-ass.

11
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,551
Oh, right in the...

12
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:06,596
Natalie, come here.
How about a kiss for good luck?

13
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:10,533
- Bill, why are you doing this?
- His name's Captain Dare.

14
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:16,599
And he'll be famous one day for
going where no dudes have gone before.

15
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,908
lf you won't give me a kiss,
how about throwing me a magazine?

16
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,407
That is it.

17
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,911
There it is.

18
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,880
That is a dumb-ass.

19
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,613
l'm the man.

20
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:05,583
What up? Come here.
You want some dirt on you?

21
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:13,796
And now the awesome Captain Dare
will make Dumb Ass history

22
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,563
in the scientifically modified
shopping cart of doom.

23
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:24,338
Rolling down this hill, hitting the launch
ramp at an estimated 24.6 miles an hour,

24
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:28,073
sailing just over
the scrumptious Natalie Gordon,

25
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,845
who will be holding
this flaming torch in her mouth.

26
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:38,015
- l didn't say l was going to do anything.
- This is the money shot. Captain, tell her.

27
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,786
What could go wrong?

28
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,660
You mean besides landing on me
and crushing my head?

29
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:50,594
lt'll be killer. The Captain will jump,
her torch will set the cart on fire.

30
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,939
And our daring hero rolling on
to salvation in the pool of life, triumphant.

31
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,937
Natalie, come on.
Just do it for me. Please?

32
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:20,394
You're gonna freakin' fly, man.
This is gonna be big. You can do this.

33
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,903
- You are the man. Show 'em, dumb-ass.
- l'm the man.

34
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:29,168
l'm the man. Captain Dumb-Ass,
comin' down. What up.

35
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,419
Bill!

36
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,216
Now that's a dumb-ass.

37
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,661
Come on, Bill, get up.

38
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,977
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- You the medical examiner?

39
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,140
l'm Dr Fountain.
You're the experts from the FBl?

40
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,251
- ''The experts?''
- l was told you were the experts.

41
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:53,554
We work on the X-Files.
Our expertise is the unexplained.

42
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:59,587
- We were told you had an unexplained death.
- You're the experts. You tell me.

43
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,963
Why don't you explain what happened?

44
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,801
Well, l can't. That's the point.

45
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:12,571
- You can't tell us anything?
- l'd prefer not to go on record.

46
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,638
- Why is that?
- The kid's parents are suing everyone.

47
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,979
- For what?
- Everything.

48
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:23,818
The county for making the street too steep,
the shop he stole the cart from,

49
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,858
the company that made the helmet he wore.

50
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:44,304
Off the record, what the hell has that
got to do with a supermarket shopping cart?

51
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:48,609
- You familiar with The Dumb Ass Show?
- The Dumb Ass Show?

52
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,878
A cable TV show where
kids act like dumb-asses.

53
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,886
- They tape themselves doing stunts.
- This was an accident?

54
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,856
l'd prefer not to get sucked
into a legal nightmare.

55
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:05,556
You investigate the unexplained.
How about you explain it to me?

56
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,869
Dr Fountain, do you see this?

57
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:25,040
- What the hell is that?
- You're asking me?

58
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,539
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- You said ''urgent.''

59
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,544
- What am l looking at?
- Maybe you can tell us.

60
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,705
ls she the expert?

61
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,893
What do you think?

62
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:15,391
Well, l have to say that l have never
seen anything quite like this before.

63
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,636
Something killed this kid.

64
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:31,979
Judging from the amount of insect feces
in the ear and nasal cavities,

65
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:38,114
they fed at such a furious rate that it caused
the boy's skull to collapse from the inside.

66
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:45,426
His helmet protected his head during
the crash. There is no impact trauma here.

67
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,267
You're saying flies killed him?

68
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:59,905
Of all the kids at the scene,
flies choose to attack this boy. Why?

69
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,346
Maybe they acted
for reasons we're not seeing.

70
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,579
What if somebody put something
in his helmet? lnsect pheromone.

71
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:14,252
Spanish Fly, that stuff you see advertised
in magazines that guys use to attract girls.

72
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,321
l glance at 'em for amusement.

73
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:23,665
l may have to brush up on my Spanish Fly,
but l don't think the science works that way.

74
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:29,639
Before we look for an MO, l wanna find out
what kind of fly would act that aggressively.

75
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:35,204
The musca vetustissima Walker,
the Australian bush fly.

76
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:40,445
lt craves protein so much, it will crawl
into your nose, mouth, ears, even eyes,

77
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,681
to feed on blood and moisture.

78
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:47,885
The New Zealand screwworm fly
often kills its victims in mere moments

79
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,987
by burrowing into an open wound or cut.

80
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,992
l'm sorry. l'm Dr Rocky Bronzino.

81
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,867
Hi. Rocky Bronzino.
Hello there. Rocky Bronzino.

82
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:05,672
Field entomological expert,
Rutgers University, at your service.

83
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,338
- Dr Bronzino...
- Rocky.

84
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,374
Neither of these flies are
indigenous to America.

85
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,353
Are you suggesting a virulent foreign vector?

86
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:20,688
No. Your specimens
are your garden-variety calliphorid,

87
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,354
harmless as, well, flies.

88
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,222
- What are you suggesting, then?
- Nothing.

89
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:33,863
Dr Fountain brought me in for my scientific
expertise and l must say l'm glad he did.

90
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:40,342
Dr Bronzino, you should know
we may be looking at a murder.

91
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,940
A murder? Are there any suspects?

92
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:37,758
Natalie Gordon, the lady in Captain Dare's
short life and the last person to see him alive.

93
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,133
- Leave me alone.
- lt's for the memorial video.

94
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,301
For a fallen hero.
A few words for Captain Dare.

95
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,675
You want a few words, Winky?

96
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:53,275
You're ajerk, and so's your brother,
for making Bill do those stupid stunts.

97
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:58,756
Captain Dare died doing what he loved,
pushing the envelope.

98
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,418
Maybe if you weren't such a...

99
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,932
Hey, you. Freaky-Deaky.

100
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:13,961
You want your own memorial?
You wanna be in Dumb Ass?

101
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,008
Just leave her alone.

102
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,599
l'm talking to you now, freak.

103
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:25,982
David Winkle. ln my office, right now.

104
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,953
Typical. Lokensgard's gonna have
his mommy stick up for him.

105
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,890
Baby.

106
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,762
That is it. There it is.

107
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:21,238
l just solved this case. This kid had
crap for brains. The flies couldn't resist.

108
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,505
- And you were a choirboy growing up?
- We were stupid, but we didn't know it.

109
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,605
This isn'tjust stupid, this glorifies stupid.

110
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,912
These kids take pride in being sub-mental.

111
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,044
That's why they call it Dumb Ass.

112
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,692
- Mr David Winkle.
- Sky Pilot Winky.

113
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,895
Just the man we wanna see. Come on in.

114
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,545
- Very entertaining, Sky Pilot.
- Sky Commander.

115
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,074
You can call me Sheriff John
as l haul your dumb ass to jail.

116
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:11,214
- What are you talkin' about?
- We have a recent email you sent,

117
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,623
offering the video of this death
to the Fox network.

118
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:19,562
No, l wrote all the networks.
Fox were the only one who were interested.

119
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,829
l don't think you understand.

120
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,597
You think l killed him?

121
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,670
You think l'd kill Captain Dare
to make money? My best friend?

122
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,836
You were the last person
to have contact with him.

123
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:39,441
You gave him his helmet at the top of the hill.
l think you put something in it.

124
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,250
- Sit down, Sky Commander.
- l can't. l'm being attacked.

125
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,121
Oh, God, it's happening to me.

126
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,329
Now that's a dumb-ass.

127
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,322
Where you been?
Dinner's been on the table an hour.

128
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,491
l'm not hungry.

129
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,668
Then you sit down here until you get hungry.

130
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,501
Dylan?

131
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,532
l have something to talk to you about.

132
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,992
l'm glad you're here. We got our first break.

133
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:14,232
- What'd you find?
- lt's what Rocky Bronzino found.

134
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:20,074
The flies that ate at the brain and skull
of the victim are all female. Every one.

135
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:24,605
- Exactly how is that a break?
- What are the chances of that?

136
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:30,019
You mean the absence of males suggests
a reason for the attack, behaviorally?

137
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:35,253
Something biological - hormonal or chemical
- caused these bugs to attack.

138
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,626
- Or a need to express themselves.
- Say what?

139
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,323
The kid known as Sky Commander Winky.

140
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:46,700
Agent Reyes and l were interviewing him
when this happened.

141
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:51,299
Paramedics treated him
for an aggressive attack of body lice.

142
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,938
Lice are not uncommon
in a school environment.

143
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,711
But these are better spellers
than most of the kids.

144
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:03,015
- So is this just another Dumb Ass stunt?
- That was my thought.

145
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,354
But he was too freaked out
to make me believe he'd staged this.

146
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,987
Which makes me think that while
you're right about this being biology,

147
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,693
someone is directing the biology.

148
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,634
How does one direct bugs?

149
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,403
l don't know, but we've been
running down a long list of witnesses.

150
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:31,708
A loner who was at every Dumb Ass stunt. He
had a run-in with Winky before the lice attack.

151
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,843
His name is Dylan Lokensgard.
We'll talk to him.

152
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,367
He's just not well. He's unable to talk.

153
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:21,029
Dylan, l wanna have a talk with you.

154
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,265
Honey, can you come out here?

155
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,882
- Where are you going?
- To school.

156
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,654
l know where you're going.

157
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,062
- What did Natalie want?
- Stay away from her. She's no good for you.

158
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,829
We've been friends since we were kids.

159
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,996
But you're not kids any more,
which is why we need to talk.

160
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:05,008
Your body is going through changes.

161
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,012
You don't understand anything.
l don't wanna talk to you.

162
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,572
l wish Dad was still here.
You know nothing about me.

163
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:18,283
Honey, l want what's best for you.
Dylan, come back here.

164
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:33,195
So many flowers, so little time.

165
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:39,604
- Excuse me?
- Pheromones, Dr Scully. Heavy in the air.

166
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:45,116
Nature's natural attractants, driving
the insect world to go forth and pollinate.

167
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:50,986
l'm aware how pheromones work. According
to this there are no pheromones here.

168
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,616
That can't be right.

169
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:58,356
The sensor is an actual fly antenna,
over which the pheromones pass.

170
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,364
l modified the EAG
to measure in picograms,

171
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,492
making it sensitive
for a mile in any direction.

172
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:11,408
l still don't see why pheromones might cause
a harmless fly to attack a human, Doctor.

173
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,307
Rocky.

174
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:20,014
Bugs are small-minded
and therefore very predictable.

175
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:24,351
They don't have moods.
They react to circumstance and stimuli.

176
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,221
They have been doing it for millennia.

177
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:31,558
So what do you suppose
they're reacting to out here?

178
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:39,200
lt may be the bugs are being
somehow driven crazy with desire.

179
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:45,173
They say we humans
respond to pheromones too.

180
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,741
- l agree with that.
- Women's dormitory syndrome.

181
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:56,014
Pheromones are the reason that women who
live together share the same menstrual cycle.

182
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,685
Fascinating.

183
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:06,596
When a male and female calliphorid fly mate,
they are joined for up to one and a half hours.

184
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,361
One and a half, Doctor.

185
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,936
Rocky, l'm a mother.

186
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,974
Mothers are women too.

187
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,308
- Big hit.
- What is it?

188
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:29,615
A high concentration of C-13 calliphorone.

189
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,780
lncoming.

190
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,522
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

191
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,163
- What about your bike?
- l'll get it later.

192
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:25,170
- l came by your house to see you.
- Really?

193
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,212
Your mom said
something was wrong with you.

194
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,304
Me? No, l'm fine.

195
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,180
What did you want?

196
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:39,849
l wanted to apologize about
what happened yesterday at the cafeteria.

197
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,518
Winky can be such ajerk.

198
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,887
l was just worried about you.

199
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,436
What did l say?

200
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,565
Nothing.

201
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,367
No one understands.

202
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:06,850
My mom and dad think
it's just gonna go away.

203
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,250
What l'm feeling.

204
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,522
You mean about Bill?

205
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,661
l wish you could just turn back time.

206
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:25,567
l wish you could just make everything
go away, and start all over again.

207
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,197
l know, like when we were kids.

208
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,904
Remember that night
we played hide-and-seek on your street?

209
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,074
Manhunt.

210
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,609
We hid in the tree together.

211
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,887
Our names are still carved in it.

212
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,795
l'm gonna be late.

213
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,373
Dylan Lokensgard?

214
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,204
Can you come with us, Dylan?

215
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:18,322
And now the awesome Captain Dare
will make Dumb Ass history...

216
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:25,820
- Why are you showing me this?
- What do you think of it?

217
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:31,096
- You mean The Dumb Ass Show?
- That and the kids who make it.

218
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,431
l know 'em.

219
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:39,603
You ever have contact with Bill,
the kid who played Captain Dare?

220
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:44,340
You have anything against him?

221
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:49,011
Do you think it's strange that
he was attacked and killed by insects?

222
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,520
Who wouldn't?

223
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,026
- What's going on?
- We're talking to Dylan.

224
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,153
No, you're not. Dylan.

225
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:03,792
No one interrogates my son in my office
without my permission.

226
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,430
- Calm down.
- He's not a part of that crowd.

227
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,772
- What are you accusing him of?
- We're just asking what he knows.

228
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,438
- He doesn't know anything.
- He was at the crime scene.

229
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,108
So were a lot of kids. Dylan...

230
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:39,230
Too late, gentlemen. The bugs are gone.

231
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,705
Bugs are all gone.

232
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,242
Whatever.

233
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,050
- How is he?
- He's unhurt, apparently.

234
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,053
Not so much as a single bite on him.

235
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,821
Mrs Lokensgard,
we haven't finished talking to Dylan.

236
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,886
Yes, you have. We're going home.

237
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:33,184
l've said it before. This case is attracting flies
because somebody's full of crap.

238
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,022
l think what we just saw was a show.

239
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:41,930
Dylan made the bugs attack him to make
himself look like a victim, not the perpetrator.

240
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:45,867
OK, but how?
This guy's a horse whisperer for bugs?

241
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:50,033
l don't know how he's doing it,
but l may know a way to find out.

242
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,310
- Where did you get this?
- Dylan gave it to us in his interview.

243
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:07,119
There's not a lot to be found
in a teenage boy's sweaty Kleenex.

244
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:11,059
You want pheromones.
Aren't they in adolescent sweat?

245
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:17,728
Yes, it's what causes BO. But obviously
it's not all that attractive - to anything.

246
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:30,072
l've got a reading going right off the scale.

247
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,847
Holy Toledo.

248
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:39,186
We got pheromones coming out the
Yin-Yang here. C-13 calliphorone, and how.

249
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,855
- What happened?
- l think my electroantennogram tilted.

250
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:52,460
- What's C-13 calliphorone?
- lnsect pheromone.

251
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:56,940
- Where did you find this mother lode?
- A boy, Dylan Lokensgard.

252
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,171
That specimen came from him.

253
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:06,976
A boy secreting bug pheromones?
That's impossible. Preposterous.

254
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:11,216
You're the expert, Dr Bronzino.
How else do you explain it?

255
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,351
Rocky?

256
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:22,798
A boy is a boy, a bug is a bug.
You can't have it both ways.

257
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:27,702
He's going through puberty.
Maybe his body chemistry is going crazy

258
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,799
and his raging teenage hormones
are attracting insects.

259
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,835
What if it's more than chemistry
or hormones or biology?

260
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,577
Dylan's notjust attracting bugs.
He's using them.

261
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,517
Yes, but against what?

262
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:48,423
- We saw him talking to a girl.
- The one in the Dumb Ass video.

263
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,222
Captain Dare's girlfriend.

264
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,450
- What are you doing?
- l need to talk to you.

265
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,894
You have to be quiet.
My mom's gonna hear you.

266
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,033
l'm coming up.

267
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,035
What? No.

268
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,941
- You're gonna break your neck.
- l needed to see you.

269
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,495
l haven't been here in so long.

270
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,401
Since fourth grade.

271
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,270
After school.

272
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:18,272
lt was a Wednesday in April.

273
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,150
''A dream in a mist of gray.''

274
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,961
That's from a Syd Barrett song.

275
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:39,136
- How do you know all these things?
- My dad told me.

276
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:45,004
Syd Barrett, he was in the band Pink Floyd.

277
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:49,102
He was this brilliant guy
that nobody understood.

278
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,842
Kinda like you.

279
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,645
Me?

280
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:02,115
l never said l was sorry when
your dad disappeared, Dylan.

281
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,162
l never said a lot of things.

282
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,059
But l wanna say 'em now.

283
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,298
l know you've always cared about me.

284
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:22,206
We've grown apart,
but l haven't forgotten you.

285
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:29,983
And after we talked this morning at school,

286
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:35,682
l realized how special you really are to me.

287
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,555
l can't believe this.

288
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,928
After what happened to Bill,

289
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:54,834
l realized how important it is to have
someone who does understand you.

290
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,413
l want us to do this.

291
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,626
That was amazing.

292
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:30,542
What was that?

293
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,810
What was what?

294
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:36,114
Your tongue.
There's something wrong with you.

295
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,484
No, don't say that.

296
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,593
- l need to go.
- Natalie, please don't.

297
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,151
Just stay. Let me talk to you.

298
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,001
Natalie, listen to me.

299
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,162
Natalie, please.

300
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,188
Hey, Bug Boy.

301
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,420
How about we go for
a little buzz around the block?

302
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,991
So, Lokensgard, how'd you do it?

303
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,196
How'd you kill him?

304
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:34,275
- Bugs killed Captain Dare.
- Yeah, bugs that do what you say.

305
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,610
You wanna know how l did it?

306
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,647
l'll show you.

307
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,647
Maybe you should get your camera ready.

308
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:52,158
- What are you talkin' about?
- l just have to open my mouth.

309
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,722
What the hell... Oh, God!

310
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:45,908
l'm getting a reading here.
Trace levels inside the house.

311
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,782
l guess that's probable cause.

312
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,554
Dr Scully?

313
00:34:56,627 --> 00:35:00,757
This is so exciting.
l've never had a partner before.

314
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,290
l have.

315
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:06,700
l think of it as a hymenopteran relationship.

316
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:11,799
Two scientists reaching higher
than either of them could reach alone.

317
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:15,811
lf l may say so, Doctor,
you complete me.

318
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:22,045
- l got upstairs, you take down.
- All right.

319
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,270
Oh, God.

320
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:51,136
David Winkle, is that you?

321
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,912
- Now that's a dumb-ass.
- lt wasn't a stunt.

322
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,784
lt was Dylan Lokensgard. He attacked us.

323
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:01,757
- He attacked you?
- The dude's a freakin' bug.

324
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,954
He chewed right out the back window.

325
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:13,160
You stay. l'll see that Dylan
didn't head to that girl's house.

326
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,376
Where are you?

327
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:29,214
l'm with Rocky at the Lokensgard house.
Nobody's here.

328
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,447
l'm afraid the kid's on a tear.

329
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:36,960
- He's caused an accident on Glenhaven Road.
- How'd he do that?

330
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,357
Better see for yourself.

331
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,869
C-13 calliphorone. l got a reading up here.

332
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,965
Dylan's bedroom's up there.
Unfortunately he's not in it.

333
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,501
- Where are you going?
- Kid's on a rampage.

334
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,473
You got my number, partner.

335
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:11,218
- Natalie?
- Whoever you are, leave me alone.

336
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,059
l'm Monica Reyes, with the FBl.

337
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,532
l'm here because l need your help.

338
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:21,003
- lt's about Dylan.
- Don't say that name.

339
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,508
lt's important.
You may be the key to stopping him.

340
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:30,707
Dylan Lokensgard is a freak.
l thought he was the normal one.

341
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:34,342
l think Dylan was normal, like any other kid.

342
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,387
This is to do with what he's becoming.

343
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:41,949
- He kissed me.
- And it's probably what he's living for.

344
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:46,018
lt's probably why he attacked
David Winkle and his brother.

345
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,691
- He attacked Winky?
- They'll be OK.

346
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:54,432
We just wanna make sure
he doesn't hurt anyone else.

347
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,472
Come with me.

348
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:09,743
- Why did you run from me?
- What is wrong with you?

349
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:17,123
l'm different. lsn't that what you wanted?
Somebody different from Bill and Winky.

350
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:21,392
- You killed Bill.
- To keep you from being killed.

351
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:28,130
- And now you're coming with me.
- Stay where you are, Dylan.

352
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,785
Don't try and stop me. That little talk
you wanted to have, it'll have to wait.

353
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:20,290
- Where do you think you're going?
- We're going, me and Natalie.

354
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,952
- l'll be taking the car.
- You won't.

355
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:27,191
Don't cross me. l'm not
a kid everybody can kick around any more.

356
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,994
You think l don't know what you are?

357
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:37,166
lt's what l've been trying to tell you,
to save you from what you are about to do.

358
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:45,882
These are the things l couldn't tell you,
the things l couldn't tell your father.

359
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,713
You are not like the other kids.

360
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,017
You never will be.

361
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,661
Monica.

362
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,597
Holy Mother.

363
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,602
Monica, hold on. Can you hear me?

364
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:10,003
Can you breathe? Monica, talk to me.

365
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,565
- He's got the girl.
- Where'd they go?

366
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:16,840
- To Dylan's house.
- That's where Scully is.

367
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:21,613
She lost phone contact
with the entomologist Bronzino.

368
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:39,094
Where are they?

369
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,504
Help me.

370
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,321
Help me.

371
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:14,364
Four bodies were found in the attic,

372
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:19,903
including that of Michael Lokensgard,
Dylan's father, long reported missing.

373
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:24,236
He, like the others,
fell victim to Dylan's mother,

374
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:30,143
who, in Dr Rocky Bronzino's expert opinion,
was neither human nor insect,

375
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,877
but something in between,
a biological anomaly

376
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:38,978
whose difference from the rest of humanity
could be hidden only for so long.

377
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,856
However strong
Dylan Lokensgard's yearning to fit in,

378
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:46,920
to win acceptance, to love and to be loved,

379
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:51,525
he could not defeat the unseen forces
which direct behavior.

380
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:56,062
ln the struggle between our desire
to determine what we will be

381
00:42:56,173 --> 00:43:01,702
and the identity which biology defines for us,
there can only be one outcome.

382
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:06,580
But even in victory, there are
forces biology cannot defeat.

383
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,084
The stirrings of the soul,

384
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,711
the mysteries of desire,

385
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:17,523
the simple truth that
the heart wants what the heart wants.

386
