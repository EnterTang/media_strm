1
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:14,242
今夜，我指点江山
Tonight, I point at some fields,

2
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:17,082
理查德在角落里东张西望
Richard minces round a corner,

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,883
詹姆斯讲述他的理想夜生活
and James describes his ideal night in.

4
00:00:19,955 --> 00:00:23,131
呕吐物和口水，以及其它各种排泄物
Vomit and sputum,and other bodily secretions.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,040
大家好，晚上好。谢谢大家。非常感谢
Hello, good evening.Thank you so much. Thank you.

7
00:00:33,118 --> 00:00:36,278
谢谢。好的。我们开始
Thank you. Now, we begin,

8
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:39,547
今晚我们从揽胜运动版开始说起
we begin with the Range Rover Sport.

9
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:42,664
经历了八年的时光，揽胜运动版即将走到尽头
After eight years,it's gone out of production.

10
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:45,144
路虎将不再生产该款车型
They are not going to make any more.

11
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,864
这是一件好事
And this is a good thing,

12
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:51,264
因为这车一直有个大问题
because there's always been one major problem with it,

13
00:00:51,265 --> 00:00:54,185
理查德哈蒙德接下来会向各位解释其中缘由
as Richard Hammond shall now explain.

14
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:03,305
就是这款车了，即将走下历史舞台的路虎揽胜运动版
Here we are, then. The soon-to-be deceased Range Rover Sport.

15
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:08,425
这车身上可能有很多你不喜欢的因素
There are many things you might object to about this car.

16
00:01:09,865 --> 00:01:13,664
但最大的问题总是显而易见的
But the biggest problem has always been very simple.

17
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:16,745
就是它的名字 - 揽胜运动版
It's the badge - Range Rover Sport.

18
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:23,624
首先，在这车的外表之下实际是一台路虎发现的底盘
First of all, underneath this is the chassis of a Land Rover Discovery

19
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,984
所以这货不是真正的揽胜
so it's not a Range Rover,

20
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:28,264
并且因为用的是发现的底盘
and because it's the chassis of a Land Rover Discovery,

21
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:30,065
这车的体重接近3吨
it weighs nearly three tonnes.

22
00:01:31,145 --> 00:01:33,225
所以它也不怎么运动
So it's not sporty either.

23
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:39,584
它成功的忽悠了许多不知实情的
Its success hinged on appealing to people who didn't know that,

24
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:41,185
或知道真相的傻富帅
or indeed, anything.

25
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:48,224
实际上，这车的买主通常只有两类人 - 球星
Basically, this car was only bought by two types of people - footballers

26
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:50,825
以及球星们的老婆
and people who were married to footballers.

27
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:55,865
所以这车的老家在这里
And the Sport's stamping ground is this place.

28
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:01,105
位于柴郡的英超球员居住区威尔姆斯洛
The Premier League ghetto of Wilmslow in Cheshire.

29
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:17,144
乔治亚式暴发户电动大门
Genuine Georgian electric gates right there.

30
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:19,785
这里也是。那里也是
And there. And there.

31
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:25,305
乔治亚式暴发户私人监控摄像头
Georgian security cameras.

32
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:32,745
整齐的草坪，很适合私家烧烤
Manicured lawns, very popular for spit-roast barbecues.

33
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:36,624
显然，这里的阔佬们会比其它郡的居民
Apparently, they drink more champagne per head here

34
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,025
消耗更多的香槟酒
than in any other county.

35
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:41,825
真富有
Class.

36
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:50,904
威尔姆斯洛的富人们会怀念这款车
The people of Wilmslow are going to miss this car,

37
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:54,744
不过在他们为此伤心之前
but before they start weeping onto their marble breakfast bars,
 
38
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:56,705
我有个好消息要告诉他们
I have some good news.

39
00:02:57,985 --> 00:03:00,905
因为路虎推出了新款换代车型
Because now there is a new one.

40
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:11,784
新车起售价5W英镑（46.8万人民币），比现款揽胜更便宜
With prices starting at £50,000, it's cheaper than a proper Range Rover

41
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:17,984
并且有七个座椅，所以更为实用
and because it's available with seven seats, it's more practical, as well.

42
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:20,024
但就像我开始时说的那样
But like I said at the beginning,

43
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:22,504
老款揽胜运动版有些名不副实
the old Range Rover Sport was a bit of a fraud.

44
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:26,584
新的问题同样如此，这车是否是一辆真正的揽胜
The question must be,is this one really a Range Rover

45
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:28,384
并且像它名字一样真的很运动呢？
and is it a Sport?

46
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:30,105
让我们开始第一项挑战
Let's start with that first bit.

47
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:38,884
不论装备有多豪华奢侈，决定这车是否担得起揽胜这块金字招牌的标准
No matter how much wood and leather it's fitted with, the mark

48
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,265
就在于它能不能搞定这些严酷的地形
of a real Range Rover is being able to tackle this sort of stuff.

49
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:49,945
现在是关键，来了
Important work being done,coming through.

50
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:55,064
首先你要知道
Well, the first thing you need to know

51
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:58,704
在这辆揽胜的外表之下不再是一辆路虎发现
is that this is not a Discovery in a Range Rover frock.

52
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,984
它有着货真价实的揽胜底盘
It has the proper Range Rover chassis

53
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:04,584
以及和揽胜一样的地形回馈系统
and the same terrain response system, as well.

54
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:07,824
这些系统实时探测你驶过的路面情况
This analyses the ground you're driving over

55
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:10,864
同时自动地调整悬挂阻尼，变速箱响应
and automatically adjusts the suspension, gearbox,

56
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:12,865
刹车以及引擎输出功率
brakes and engine output to suit.

57
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:20,025
来了、来了，这坡几乎就是垂直的悬崖！
Big, big, almost vertical hill now!

58
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:27,265
坡度非常陡，非常陡，很泥泞
Very steep, very steep, very muddy.

59
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:35,224
这真是...这才叫爬坡
That is... that is a climb.

60
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:36,425
干的不错，小家伙
Well done, you.

61
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:43,864
除了地形回馈系统，还有个控制防倾杆的行车电脑
Besides the terrain response,there's also a computer

62
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:48,345
用来调整轮胎对地面的附着力
that disconnects the anti-roll bars to increase wheel articulation.

63
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,304
轻松搞定
We're over.

64
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:58,904
我想说，我刚刚驶过一个大的交叉驼峰
I mean, that was a big old cross-axling hump to get over.

65
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:00,305
可我甚至都没有注意到这一点！
It didn't even notice!

66
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:03,944
这车还有更多本事
And there's more.

67
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:06,144
啊！积水
Ah! Water.

68
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:09,344
很好。是时候使用秘密武器了
Good. Gives me a chance to play with something else I have on board

69
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:10,665
秘密武器就是...
and that is...

70
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,825
声纳。大吃一惊吧！
sonar. Kid you not!

71
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:23,584
声纳装置就安装在后视镜里面
Sonar transmitters and receivers in the door mirrors

72
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:25,424
实时探测水的深度
measure the depth of the water.

73
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,145
在水位过高时会发出警报
It will make a big noise if it's getting too deep.

74
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,585
现在的水深不需要担心，没问题
It's not worried, not worried.

75
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:40,425
我感觉就像驾驶着一间豪华总统套房驶过这片泥地
I feel like I'm driving a luxury hotel room through a swamp.

76
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:43,065
酷
Cool.

77
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:47,145
哦嚯！真陡！
Oh-ho! That's steep!

78
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:57,704
假装什么都没发生过...
Just pretty much like it never...

79
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:00,064
那里，我想我已经修好了
There, I think I've repaired that.

80
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:03,504
多多少少还有点。就这样了
More or less. That's how it was.

81
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:04,945
很好
Good.

82
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,544
所以，总结一下
So, there we are.

83
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:12,224
这辆车，在识货的人手上，是很好的越野利器
This car, in the right hands,is very good off-road.

84
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:14,664
但是现在，我们要继续对它进行其他测试
And now, we must move on,

85
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,905
针对这车标榜的运动特性
to this bit of the badge.

86
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:22,424
欢迎来到多宁顿公园赛道（曾经的F1赛道）
Welcome to Donington Park racetrack,

87
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:26,624
如果这货真像路虎官方声称的那么运动
and if the Sport is as sporty as Land Rover claims,

88
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,185
那它在这里的表现应该会很不错
it should put on a good show here.

89
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,424
如今这车有V6和V8两款柴油引擎可供选择
Now, you can get these with a V6 or a V8 diesel.

90
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:47,384
我现在驾驶的这款车是503马力的V8车型
The one I'm in is the supercharged petrol V8 with 503-brake horsepower,

91
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:49,945
这就是我要驾驭的动力
so that is the power taken care of.

92
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:56,264
因为这车采用了全新的揽胜全铝合金底盘
And because it's built on the brand-new all-aluminium chassis of the proper Range Rover,

93
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:59,945
所以它比老款揽胜运动版轻了半吨
it's getting on for half a tonne lighter than the old Sport.

94
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:06,024
那个弯，出弯，随后而来的动力汹涌澎湃！
That turn, lift, and then it comes around and then bang!

95
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,065
503匹的强劲四驱动力让你行驶如飞！
503-braked all four wheels and off you go!

96
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,464
在减轻重量的同时
And as well as the weight loss,

97
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:19,984
电子控制的防侧倾杆实时对抗车身的弯道倾斜
the computer-controlled suspension fights body roll,

98
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:24,025
并且这车还有一套类似宝马M5的后轮主动差速器
and there's an active rear diff like you'd get on a BMW M5.

99
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:28,944
它还有一套被称作扭矩矢量控制的系统
It also has something called torque vectoring,

100
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:33,184
这是一套用来决定每个车轮何时何地分配多少动力的系统
which dictates how much power is sent to each of the wheels and when.

101
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,664
我的意思是，这些东西都是超级跑车才会用到的玩意
I mean, that is supercar stuff.

102
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:38,505
就像你在迈凯轮MP-12C上能看到的东西
That's what you get on the McLaren 12C road car.

103
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,344
更让我惊叹的是
What's staggering me right now

104
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:44,904
把这车开到这条赛道上
is that hurling this car around this racetrack,

105
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:49,344
它感觉并不像是我在逼它做一件它不愿意的事情
it doesn't feel like I'm asking it to do anything it doesn't want to do.

106
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,585
这感觉就像是坐在家中的沙发上一样
It feels at home.

107
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:57,065
简而言之，在这条赛道上，它很出色。但究竟有多出色？
All in all, on a track,it's good. But how good?

108
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,504
好的，为了找出确切答案
Well, to find out,

109
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:04,824
我们必须，就像通常一样，请出我们活泼可爱的圈养车手来做测试
we must, as ever, call on the help of the world's chattiest racing driver.

110
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:08,184
今天，Stig要驾驶一辆mini cooper GP
Today, The Stig is in a Mini John Cooper Works GP,

111
00:08:08,185 --> 00:08:11,945
你能买到的全球最NB的掀背小车
one of the most hardcore hot-hatches you can buy.

112
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:16,584
现在，他要用这辆mini做一圈成绩
And now, he's going to use it to set a lap time.

113
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:19,025
准备好了之后...走你！
When you're ready... go!

114
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:35,304
现在，让我们看看
Now, let's find out

115
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:38,744
这个成绩能不能被这辆又大又重的四驱车给击败
if that can be beaten by the big, bulky four by four.

116
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:41,865
为了监督程序按规定执行，我坐上了副驾
And to oversee proceedings,I shall ride shotgun.

117
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:46,984
好处在于
The beauty of this is,

118
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:51,785
这家伙不知道上一款车叫什么名字，也不知道这款车是怎么回事
he has no idea what that last car was called, no idea what he's in now.

119
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:54,984
毫不关心。没有偏见，如你所见
Doesn't care. No bias, you see.

120
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:57,945
他所能做的就是尽可能的开快
All he can do is try and go as fast as he can.

121
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:02,345
我们出发了！
And we're off!

122
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:09,104
进入第一弯，没有带刹车
Head towards the first corner, not braking at all for the first corner.

123
00:09:09,105 --> 00:09:12,105
噢，真是非常，非常的快！
Oh, that's very,very quick down there!

124
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,425
这速度我都快失禁了
Some wee might have come out there.

125
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:20,104
哇噢！完美刹车。很好
Whoa! Brakes work. That's good.

126
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:21,744
不用担心他被甩出去
I'm not worried about putting him off

127
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:25,785
因为这点打滑声对他来说就像鸭叫一样。毫不足虑
because this is just like a quacking noise for him. It's irrelevant.

128
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:30,664
现在是很关键的时刻
It's worth remembering about now

129
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:33,824
这毕竟还是一辆很大、很重的车
that this is still a very big, heavy car.

130
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:37,185
它的重量比最重的奔驰S级还要大
It weighs more than the heaviest Mercedes S-class.

131
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:42,424
但在Stig的极限驾驭下，这车依旧尽在掌握
But even at Stig speed, the Sport seemed to have everything in order.

132
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:45,824
理论上我们现在的车身姿态应该和比萨斜塔有得一拼
We should be The Leaning Tower of Range Rover Sport right now,

133
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:48,385
但是我们没有。这真是太神奇了！
but somehow we're not.It's fantastic!

134
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:55,664
刚刚过去一分钟
We just crossed over a minute.

135
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:58,344
这磨胎声是磨胎史上
That's the longest protracted tyre squeal

136
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:00,705
最长的磨胎声
in the history of tyres and squealing.

137
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:06,464
噢，这真是...我的天，简直和飞一样
Oh, that is... My, that was flying.

138
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:08,585
S弯！真快
Chicane! That is fast.

139
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:15,144
最后的大直道
And on to the final straight.

140
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:16,505
129.8秒是我们的目标
129.8 to beat.

141
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:24,865
129.5秒。没错
129.5. There it is.

142
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:33,064
所以，路虎开了这么多年的空头支票
So, after years of writing cheques it can't cash,

143
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:39,425
如今这款车终于赢得了实至名归的揽胜运动版称号
this car has finally earned the right to be called the Range Rover Sport.

144
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:50,624
超越老款一大截。真的很不错。是的
Massively better than the old one.Massively better. Yeah.

145
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:54,784
终于，它能配得上这个运动版的称号了
And definitely worthy now of the Range Rover Sport badge,

146
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:58,424
但我更喜欢比较大的老款揽胜
but I'd still prefer to have the big proper Range Rover.

147
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,424
不，如果你买了大号的揽胜，你会很长时间后悔自己
No, because if you buy the big one,you'll spend half your time

148
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:03,904
没有买新运动版并且还节省了2万块
wishing you'd saved 20 grand and bought the Sport.

149
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,904
不，你这么看，关键在于
No, because you see, the thing is,

150
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:08,944
老款揽胜有分体式后备箱门
the proper Range Rover has a split tailgate,

151
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:12,544
这是所有揽胜都应该有的配置。看。那货就没有这个高科技
which all Range Rovers should have.Look. That one doesn't have this.

152
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:15,344
确实没有，但是新运动版比老款更好看
No, but the Range Rover Sport is better looking.

153
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:18,424
驾驶感更好，并且还有七个座位
It's better to drive,and you can get it with seven seats.

154
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:21,104
是的，但是当我带着我的爱犬出门遛弯的时候，知道吗
Yes, but when I take my dogs for a walk, OK,

155
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:22,984
它们窜出去之后我看着后门
they leap out and I look at that

156
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:26,824
同时想到，“是的！你看，我能这么优雅的坐着”
and think, "Yes! You know what,I'll have a nice sit down."

157
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:30,464
所以你所谓的遛狗就是坐着？没错，我喜欢坐着
So your walks are spent sitting down?Yeah, I like sitting down.

158
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:33,584
什么，你多花2万镑（18.7万人民币）就为了那个分体式后备箱门？
What, so you'd spend £20,000 basically on a bench?

159
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:35,104
既然如此你为什么不买辆新运动版
Why wouldn't you buy the Sport

160
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:38,385
同时去加油站的便利店花1英镑买个便宜的折叠椅子？
and one of those folding chairs from a petrol station for a quid?

161
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,744
但它不是折叠门
But it isn't just the bench.

162
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:46,424
这辆更大，而且正如我们所知道的一样，更大通常就代表着更好
This is bigger, and bigger, as we know, is always better than smaller.

163
00:11:46,425 --> 00:11:48,105
好吧，也不是所有时候都更好，比如...
Well, not always, not in...

164
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:51,264
比如擦伤，就不是
Not in bruises, it's not.

165
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:54,144
擦伤确实不是。但有奖证券呢
Not bruises, no. Premium Bond wins.

166
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:55,744
心脏病
Heart attacks.

167
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:57,224
呃...
Erm...

168
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:58,424
烟火表演
Fireworks.

169
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:00,025
喜出望外的消费账单
Unexpected bills.

170
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:04,024
女同学们，你们谁能想出有什么东西是
Ladies, can you think of anything which is better

171
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:05,905
大比小更好的？（邪恶的杰瑞米 - -#）
when it's bigger than smaller?

172
00:12:07,505 --> 00:12:09,984
好的，现在是新闻环节。几个星期以前
Now, the news.And a couple of weeks ago,

173
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:12,904
在录制完节目返回的时候，我行驶在A3公路上
on the way back from the show,going along the A3,

174
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:15,784
一个前方的交通事故把我堵在路上一个半小时
I was held up for an hour and a half by an accident.

175
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:17,944
当我拼死拼活挤到车龙的前面去时
When I eventually got to the front of the queue,

176
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,664
我看见了事故车满地的残渣碎片
expecting a scene of devastation,

177
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:24,144
一辆菲亚特500的保险杠半挂在车的一端
I found a Fiat 500 with the bumper hanging off at one end...

178
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:26,264
噢，不！两、三条道路都被封闭了
Oh, no!Two of the three lanes closed,

179
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:29,504
然后许多穿制服的人就出现在了现场
and then just a load of people in uniforms sort of milling about.

180
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:31,664
这些穿制服的人，詹姆斯，让我猜猜
These people in uniform,James, let me guess,

181
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:36,104
他们是不是叫做“高速公路交通执法局事故处理员”？
were they by any chance Highway Agency Traffic Enforcement Officers?

182
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:39,864
啊哈，是的。我就知道他们是。我们以前谈到过他们
Ah, yes. I knew they would be. We've spoken about these people before

183
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:41,864
并且我们今天又要谈到他们
and I think we should speak about them again

184
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:44,224
因为他们任职于高速公路管理处
because they were employed by the Highways Agency

185
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:48,904
以保持高速路的通畅，但是他们经常干的事情就是封闭高速路。没错
to keep the roads open, and all they ever do is shut them. Yeah.

186
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:51,824
他们到了现场做的第一件事就是“好的，必须马上封路”
As soon as they get their first job,"Right, must close the road."

187
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:54,104
“后视镜掉了？封路”
"Dislodged door mirror?Close the road."

188
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:56,184
“有孩子晕车了？封路”
"Child a bit carsick?Close the road."

189
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:59,264
“有人报告说他的颈部扭伤了？封路，绝对没错”
"Someone says they've got whiplash?Close the road. It's serious."

190
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:03,305
顺便补充一句，说颈部扭伤的人不是真的受伤了，他们其实就是诈骗保险金而已
Whiplash, by the way,is not a serious injury,it's insurance fraud.

191
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:07,304
这就是他们干的事，并且这些行为需要被禁止
And that's all they do and they've got to be stopped.

192
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:10,504
我认为他们只能在以下情况时封路
I think they should only be allowed to close the road

193
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:13,984
那就是用一个词就能描述他所遇到的事故
if certain words are being used to describe the incident.

194
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:18,904
“地狱”“火山爆发”“世界末日”
"Inferno", "crater", "apocalyptic."

195
00:13:18,905 --> 00:13:20,944
“日本沉没”是的
"Felt in Japan." Yes.

196
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:24,464
“无头女尸”没错，没错
"Can't find the head." Yes, yes.

197
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:27,264
如果交通部在报告上这么说
If Sally Traffic says that on the traffic report,

198
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,904
“找不到那人的脑袋了”那你们就可以封路了
"Can't find the head", then you can think about closing the road.

199
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:34,305
但你仍然需要征得某人的同意才能执行、而那人正是我
But you still have to ring somebody for permission and that is me.

200
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:38,144
我永远不会批准他们这么干
I'd basically never give them permission.

201
00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:41,344
我只会告诉他们，他们的工作就是清理事故垃圾。没错
I would remind them that their job is to clear up litter. Yes.

202
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:44,544
这就是他们该干的，通过你的描述，我觉得听起来他们更像是魔法世界的小精灵
They are, as you once described,they're basically Wombles.

203
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:47,904
是的，这是份不错的工作，他们应该珍惜所得到的一切
Yes, it's a lovely job and they should appreciate what they've got.

204
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:51,824
这很有意思。他们能在地底工作，地面工作
It's fun. They can work underground, overground.

205
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:56,144
他们能把找到的东西变成神奇的工具。是的，他们有这本事
They could make good use of the things they find. Yes, they could.

206
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:59,424
就像传说中那样。多么幸运
Things that everyday folk just leave behind. What an opportunity.

207
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:03,104
我觉得应该把他们打扮成小精灵那样
I think we should dress them up like actual Wombles.

208
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:07,184
来吧，有谁想在马路边看看小精灵长啥样？
Come on, who wouldn't want to see a Womble by the side of the road?

209
00:14:07,185 --> 00:14:09,384
我不敢想象我被小精灵拦下来是种什么感觉
I wouldn't mind being stopped by a Womble

210
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:13,704
这也对各位的人身安全有益，因为没人会忍心开车压过一个小精灵，不是吗？
and it would be good for your own safety because nobody would want to run over a Womble, would they?

211
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:15,544
你会很小心驾驶的。你会伤心欲绝！
You'd be careful.You'd be heartbroken!

212
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:17,384
他们也不需要穿制服
They wouldn't need hi-vis.

213
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:21,304
好的，再聊聊可爱的英国皇家邮政局，就像我们知道的那样，他们经常发行纪念邮票
Now, the Royal Mail, as we know,often issues commemorative stamps.

214
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:24,664
把一些东西印上去，例如一只啄木鸟，一顶帽子或者一种疾病
They pick on a subject like woodpeckers or hats or diseases.

215
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:28,704
疾病？！不管怎样，他们最近又打算发行一套邮票
Diseases?! Anyway, they've decided to do a range of stamps

216
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:30,944
基于经典的英国车型
based on classic British motoring cars.

217
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:33,464
我找到一些他们试做的样本
I've got some of the ones they've done for you here.

218
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:36,384
这是莲花精灵。当然这不是邮票的实际尺寸
There's the Lotus Esprit. This isn't the actual size of the stamp.

219
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:39,184
我刚才还在猜！这只是实物模型
I did wonder! This is a mock-up.

220
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:42,865
他们印了莲花精灵和阿斯顿马丁DB5
They've got the Lotus Esprit and they've got the Aston Martin DB5

221
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,985
如果你不希望你的信件抵达目的地，那就贴张MG的邮票
and if you don't want your letter to get there, the MG.

222
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:53,184
噢，天啊，看看这货，多么忧郁的样子
Oh, God, look at that, dismal.

223
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:57,304
福特英格兰警车。现在它是福特安格利亚（拉丁语英格兰的意思）
The Ford Anglia police car.Now that is a Ford Anglia.

224
00:14:57,305 --> 00:15:02,904
这是我做车评以来遇见过最丑的车，多少年了，25年？80，80年
The scariest thing I've ever done in how many years have been testing cars, 25 years? 80.80 years.

225
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:06,504
80年了，被吓的大吃了一惊
In 80 years, was doing an emergency stop in one of those.

226
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,424
我老爸在这玩意里失去了他的膝盖骨
My dad lost his kneecaps in one of those.

227
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:11,704
我说的失去膝盖骨不是这样的，“它们在哪？”它们在车座下面
I don't mean lost them,like, "Where are they?" They'll be under the seat.

228
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:14,184
他撞车并且被手术切除了膝盖骨
He crashed it and they had to take his kneecaps out,

229
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:17,824
就在驾驶福特安格利亚的时候。现在他们居然把它印在邮票上
after crashing a Ford Anglia.And now they've put it on a stamp.

230
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:22,704
下面还有更糟糕的英国车，是吧？
That's more dreadful heritage Britain nonsense, isn't it?

231
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:27,464
接下来会更糟，看看这辆！这是张印有射手的邮票
It gets worse, look at that one! That is The Archers as a postage stamp.

232
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:29,504
他们干嘛不印点现代的汽车上去？
Why don't they put something modern on it?

233
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:31,824
你能印一辆迈凯轮或者一辆宾利慕尚上去
You could put the McLaren or the Bentley Mulsanne on it,

234
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:33,624
那样邮票会变的很漂亮
that would be fantastic on a stamp.

235
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,304
我是说，就像法国人不会在邮票上印一个骑着自行车的老家伙
I mean, the French wouldn't do a stamp that had an old bloke

236
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:39,224
或者一件画满洋葱的条纹T恤衫，对吧？
on a bicycle and a stripy T-shirt with some onions, would they?

237
00:15:39,225 --> 00:15:40,744
我说的就和这一样！
That's what that is!

238
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:44,224
德国人不会在邮票上印一辆半履带装甲车停在华沙城外
The Germans wouldn't do a stamp with a half-track just outside Warsaw.

239
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,144
很传神。不会的，他们确实不会这么干
Exactly. No, they really wouldn't.

240
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,304
不，杰瑞米，显然，他们不会那么干
No, Jeremy, definitely,they wouldn't do that.

241
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:50,864
他们不会，是吗？
They wouldn't, would they?

242
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:52,824
管它的，随便了，让我们继续下一个话题
No, anyway, let's move on.

243
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:55,904
马自达和阿尔法罗密欧宣称他们即将
Now Mazda and Alfa Romeo have announced they're going to do

244
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:58,504
展开一个小型运动车型的合作开发项目
a joint project to make a small sports car.

245
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:01,464
马自达给新车取名MX5
Mazda will call theirs the MX5,

246
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:04,824
阿尔法则取名蜘蛛
Alfa will call theirs the Spider.

247
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:07,384
问题在于，阿尔法罗密欧曾经干过类似的事情
The trouble is, Alfa Romeo once did this in the past.

248
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:09,464
他们和日产合作，记得吗？是的
They teamed up with Nissan,remember this? Yes.

249
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:12,664
他们和日产合作之后，当时我们就想，这是个多棒的主意啊
They teamed up with Nissan and we thought, what a great plan.

250
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:16,984
阿尔法负责外观设计和引擎部分，尼桑负责车身制造
Alfa does the styling and the engine and then Nissan builds it.

251
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:21,624
但他们和我们想的恰好相反。是的，他们就是反着来的
But they did it the other way around. Yeah, they did.

252
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,264
那是个史上最愚蠢的决定
It was the stupidest decision in history.

253
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:27,544
这就是最终的产物，女士们先生们。神车阿纳
This is what we got,ladies and gentlemen. The Arna.

254
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:29,304
噢，老天
Oh, dear.

255
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:32,864
设计出自日产之手，车身制造由阿尔法罗密欧负责
Style by Nissan,built by Alfa Romeo.

256
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:36,144
这就像是彼得·克劳奇和阿比·克兰茜的结合一样
It's a bit like going to Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy and saying,

257
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:40,424
“好的，阿比，你去吹黑哨，彼得，你来设计比基尼”
"Right, Abbey, you take the penalty and Peter, you model bikinis."

258
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:44,464
就是那么愚蠢。没有比这更糟的了
It's that idiotic.They couldn't be more wrong.

259
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:50,224
所以这回的MX5/蜘蛛，一定要保证马自达来制造
So for this MX5/Spider, job one,make sure Mazda build it.

260
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:52,704
那是必须的。马自达负责制造车身
That's essential.Mazda do the building.

261
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:54,584
阿尔法负责设计外观，以及引擎？
Alfa do the styling, engine?

262
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:57,944
是的、是的、是的。阿尔法做引擎和设计
Yeah, yeah, yeah.Alfa do the engine and the styling,

263
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:02,704
但是焊接，组装，上螺丝这些活，必须马自达来做
but welding, soldering, doing up the bolts, that's Mazda's job.

264
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:05,144
我很期待这台阿尔法马自达的合作产物
I really do want to see this Alfa Mazda.

265
00:17:05,145 --> 00:17:07,584
我想这辆结合产物
I think an MX5 Spider joint-venture,

266
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:09,224
会很不错
that could be brilliant.

267
00:17:09,225 --> 00:17:12,864
接下来我要说一个很重要的话题
Now I want to move it onto something really important.

268
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,624
几个月前市中心有些骚动
A few months ago there was a bit of a brouhaha about town centres

269
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,544
在经济下滑的这个时期，许多商店都关门了
in Britain dying,all the shops closing down.

270
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:22,224
我们被建议讲一讲这个话题是因为
And we suggested on this show that this is because

271
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:25,344
现在市中心不允许停车
you aren't really allowed to park anywhere in a town centre,

272
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,744
所以人们都去郊外购物中心买东西，就因为那里能停车
so people go to out-of-town shopping centres, where you can park.

273
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:32,424
我们曾声明老百姓需要更宽松的停车法令
We said they needed to relax the parking arrangements.

274
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:36,624
好的，现在我们有了一个强大的盟友了。是吗？难道是奥巴马？
Well, we have a powerful ally.Do we? Is it Barack Obama?

275
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:40,424
不，不是奥巴马。达斯·维德？（星战黑武士）
No, not Barack Obama. Darth Vader?

276
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:43,544
不，埃里克·皮克斯。不错啊
No, Eric Pickles. Brilliant.

277
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:46,624
谁是埃里克·皮克斯。我没听说过。你知道他是谁吗？
Who's Eric Pickles. I've no idea.Do you not know who he is?

278
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,264
好的，他不是黑武士，对吧？
Well, he's not Darth Vader, is he?

279
00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:50,144
埃里克·皮克斯，我能画出他长啥样
Eric Pickles,I can actually draw him.

280
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:55,384
他有一张很小的脸蛋，非常小
Cos he's got an incredibly small face, he's got a small face

281
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:58,304
但是他的头却非常大
and then he's got really quite a big head.

282
00:17:58,305 --> 00:18:00,465
所以他实际上就像这样。
So he actually looks like that.

283
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,784
他不是这样的吧。他是的
He doesn't look like that. He does.

284
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,584
让我们看看他真实的照片
Put a proper picture of him on the screen.

285
00:18:08,585 --> 00:18:12,144
噢，天啊，他真的长得就像你画的那样。
Oh, God, he looks like that.He does look like that.

286
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:16,904
真是太震惊了。多么意外的长相。看啊
That's amazing. What a fabulous arrangement. Look at that.

287
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:18,824
你能画出他来，真的很简单
You can draw him,it's really quite good.

288
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:22,105
你能在你的拇指上画出埃里克·皮克斯
You can have your own personal Eric Pickles on your thumb.

289
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:26,305
哇噢！这是埃里克·皮克斯！
Wow! It's Eric Pickles!

290
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:29,984
真厉害
That's brilliant.

291
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,344
我喜欢他的脸。这是副不错的长相
I like his face. That's a good face.

292
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,944
画得好。
Excellent facework.

293
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:38,264
不论如何，埃里克说过了，他是政府官员
Anyway, Eric has said, OK,and he is a government minister,

294
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:42,064
他说人们应该被允许在单黄线或者双黄线的地方
he said that you should be allowed to stop on a single yellow

295
00:18:42,065 --> 00:18:44,784
临时停车几分钟，如果只是进商店
or a double yellow linejust for a few minutes,

296
00:18:44,785 --> 00:18:46,864
买点牛奶之类的事情
while you pop into a shop to get a pint of milk.

297
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:48,984
这听起来像是大多人的共识
That sounds like perfectly good common sense.

298
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:51,944
“我只是买点东西，几分钟而已”等等，虽然如此
"I'm just popping in to the shop,out in a minute." Hang on, though.

299
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:55,224
但这是BBC的节目，所以我们不要忘了，我们要保证节目的
This is the BBC, let's not forget，so in the interests of balance

300
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:58,545
公正性和合理性，我要考虑一下这条提议的合理性
and impartiality, I will think of why that isn't a good idea.

301
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,745
这确实是条不错的建议
It's a great idea.

302
00:19:02,345 --> 00:19:05,624
所以就这么愉快的决定了，我们解决了所有的问题，我们在此表明
So there we are, we've addressed all the problems and we can say,

303
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,384
埃里克·皮克斯先生，赶快通过这项法案
Mr Pickles,implement it straight away

304
00:19:08,385 --> 00:19:10,864
不然我们就要把车停到你的脸上去了
or we shall park on your substantial face.

305
00:19:10,865 --> 00:19:13,624
公正地讲，你能在他脸上停十辆车
To be fair, you could get about ten cars on there.

306
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,624
如果你细看，他的下巴就像个环状交岔路
If you look, he's got a mini-roundabout on his chin.

307
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,144
我喜欢埃里克·皮克斯的名字。听起来不错！
I like the sound of Eric Pickles.He sounds brilliant!

308
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:21,944
他说话挺中听而且名字也不错
He talks good sense and he's called Eric Pickles.

309
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:26,024
我觉得应该把他请到我们节目来开一次廉价车
I think we should have him on the show in the Reasonably-Priced Car,

310
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:28,064
但是我又想到一个好主意
but here's the spin,here's the trick.

311
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:31,224
我们告诉他节目的廉价车是艾瑞欧原子
We tell him the reasonably-priced car is an Ariel Atom,

312
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:34,064
因为我开那车脸就像剥香蕉皮一样
because I've got a wobbly face that goes a bit like that.

313
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:39,144
想象一下他开那车会啥样！可能会整个脸都翻过来
Imagine what his face would be like!It could go inside out entirely.

314
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:43,985
太惊人了。谁想看看埃里克·皮克斯在我们节目里的样子？
Amazing. Who here thinks we should get Eric Pickles on the show?

315
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:48,584
来吧，皮克斯老兄！来Top Gear。我们希望你过来
Come on, Eric! Please come on Top Gear. We want you.

316
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:52,264
继续，许多汽车制造商都有这样的造车理念，
Moving on, a lot of carmakers have got it into their heads

317
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:56,784
肯花30万欧元买辆车的人一定是想有一辆两座的
that anyone who spends £300,000 plus on a car will want only two seats

318
00:19:56,785 --> 00:19:59,824
并且能达到惊人极速的超级跑车
and an absolutely enormous top speed.

319
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:02,744
举个例子，就像兰博基尼LP-700这样
The Lamborghini Aventador,for example.

320
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:06,944
这么做是不错，但如果你是一个对速度不怎么感兴趣
And that's great, but what if you're not really interested in speed

321
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:13,024
同时还想要比这更多座位的购车客户呢？好吧，瞧瞧这个大家伙怎么样？
and you want more than two seats?Well, how about this?

322
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:16,624
这是辆被期待已久的伦敦双层公交换代车型
It is the long-awaited replacement for the Routemaster.

323
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,664
造价33万英镑（309万人民币）
It costs £330,000 and it's known,

324
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:27,144
毫无悬念，这就是NBFL，全称：伦敦新型公交车
rather unimaginatively,as the NBFL, the new bus for London.

325
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:33,544
但它可以当作私家车来用吗，我在想？
But could it be used as a private car, I wonder?

326
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:39,745
这车能否，实际上，成为一辆NCFS，萨默塞特郡（英格兰西南部农牧区）新型公交车？
Could this, in fact, be the NCFS,the new car for Somerset?

327
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:46,504
好的，就是这里，正如你们注意到的一样
So, here we are and the first problem you notice

328
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:50,304
作为新一代伦敦巴士，它有点过于复杂了
with the new London bus is that it's a bit complicated.

329
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:52,745
所以你不能坐进去马上把它开走
So you can't just get in it and go.

330
00:20:57,945 --> 00:21:00,025
灭火系统压力正常
Fire system pressure OK.'

331
00:21:02,505 --> 00:21:06,185
启动开关。好的。我们出发
Ignition system. Right. Here we go.

332
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:09,465
靠
Cock.

333
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:20,385
轮胎气压正常。等等！
Tyre system pressure OK.' Hang on!

334
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:27,265
轮胎气压正常。噢，闭嘴
Tyre system pressure OK.Oh, bollocks.

335
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:34,384
最终，当我把所有开关都试过一遍之后
Eventually, though,if you press absolutely everything

336
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:36,785
这车总算能动了
it will actually start and set off.

337
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:42,545
看吧！看看这霸气的方向盘。
Look at me!Look at my big steering wheel.

338
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:46,144
抱歉！
Sorry!

339
00:21:46,145 --> 00:21:49,184
但是这车怎么能当成家用车？
But how does it get on as a car?

340
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:52,025
好吧、实话实说，这车太宽了
Well, if I'm honest,it is quite wide.

341
00:21:54,905 --> 00:21:58,665
而且，没错，高度也是个问题
And, yeah, all right, very occasionally the height is an issue.

342
00:22:01,345 --> 00:22:03,464
我勒个去！
Cocking Nora!

343
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:09,944
虽然它有35英尺长（10.7米），但是它驾驶起来很轻松
But even though it's 35 feet long,it's not hard to drive at all.

344
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:13,504
方向盘很轻而且很精准
The steering is light and quite direct.

345
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:18,224
它缺乏法拉利458身上的那种干脆的感觉
It lacks the crispness that you find in, say, the Ferrari 458

346
00:22:18,225 --> 00:22:19,465
但这不是坏事
but it's not bad.

347
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:24,824
更值得一提的是，不像大多数同价位的车型，
What's more, unlike most cars in a similar price bracket,

348
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:27,464
这车是完完全全的英国本土货
it's extremely home-grown.

349
00:22:27,465 --> 00:22:30,664
这车不是在英国贴牌组装那么简单
It's not something that's just been badged up over here.

350
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:34,464
它的所有零部件都是英国本土制造。底盘，车身，玻璃。
It's all made in Britain. The chassis, the bodywork, the glass.

351
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:38,464
生产它的工人也全都是英国人，它促进了英国制造业的发展
It keeps British people employed,it promotes British skill,

352
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:43,144
它展现了大英帝国的高端制造工艺。这是条死路。靠！
it advertises workmanship.This is a dead-end. Cock!

353
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:45,984
我该怎么办...？刚才开进来的时候
How did I do...?It didn't say dead-end

354
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:47,984
路口没标明这是死胡同
at the beginning of the road.

355
00:22:47,985 --> 00:22:52,464
这是个测试机动性的好地方
This, then, would be a good place to test manoeuvrability.'

356
00:22:52,465 --> 00:22:55,904
好的，我能直接开到那因为我就在巴士的前面
Right, I can go right up to that because I'm right at the front of the bus.

357
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:58,624
倒车吸引了大批围观群众
This did attract a crowd.

358
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:02,224
但如果你在一辆兰博基尼里尝试三点倒车
But if you try doing a three-point turn in a Lamborghini,

359
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:04,624
你同样也会受到围观
you get a crowd, as well.

360
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:08,385
轮胎气压正常。噢，天啊
Tyre system pressure OK.' Oh, God.

361
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:11,704
你能帮我看看车尾吗？
Can you look at the back for me?

362
00:23:11,705 --> 00:23:14,064
你能帮我检查一下我是不是撞到了建筑物？
Can you check I don't knock a building over?

363
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:15,584
这就像是维多利亚时代的英国
It's like Victorian Britain.

364
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:18,064
我雇用了一些童工帮我做事
I've employed some children to do something useful.

365
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:23,264
唯一的区别就是他们把这车当成了公交车
The only difference is that people do tend to mistake this for a bus.

366
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:26,465
当心你的狗！..都挤上了车
Mind the dog! '..and get on it.

367
00:23:29,545 --> 00:23:30,585
喂！
Oi!

368
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:38,664
我的天！下去，你们这群麻烦的，瞎胡闹的小屁孩。下去，下去！快下车。
God above! Get off, you pesky,meddling kids. Off, off! Off, off.

369
00:23:38,665 --> 00:23:43,224
不要掏出手机，不要拍照。下来，下来，下来，下来
No mobile phones, no pressing the button. Off, off, off, off.

370
00:23:43,225 --> 00:23:44,305
回到车里
Stay of the bus.

371
00:23:50,065 --> 00:23:53,625
我把自己关在驾驶室外面了。我把自己关在门外了
I've locked myself out.I've locked myself out of the bus.

372
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,984
用一把老虎钳暴力解决了该问题之后
Having sorted out the problem with pliers,

373
00:23:58,985 --> 00:24:03,585
我直接撞上了一辆大众甲壳虫。咿-咿-咿！
I immediately crashed into a Volkswagen Beetle.' Yi-yi-yi!

374
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:07,384
之后我又差点撞上一座桥
And then I nearly hit a bridge.'

375
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:09,825
4.4米？我的车身高度有4.42米！
4.4? We're 4.42! Ah!

376
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:13,425
老天，真是惊心动魄啊
God, this is exhausting.

377
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:20,584
幸运的是随着回到大路上
But with the road ahead mercifully free of traffic,

378
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:25,704
我有机会给大家介绍这辆车都有些什么高科技
there was time to talk about some of the bus's high-tech features.

379
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:27,744
这是一辆混合动力车
It's a hybrid bus, this.

380
00:24:27,745 --> 00:24:30,984
它有一台柴油引擎和一台电动机
It has a diesel engine and it has an electric motor.

381
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:33,504
电动机是驱动车辆的主角
The electric motor always drives the wheels.

382
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:37,224
柴油引擎只是用来给电机发电
The diesel engine generates electricity for the batteries.

383
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:40,345
所以这辆车和菲斯克·卡玛一个原理
So it is actually like a Fisker Karma.

384
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:43,424
0-60英里加速时间没有给出
The 0-60 time is not quoted.

385
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:46,344
因为它开不到60英里的时速
Primarily because it won't do 60.

386
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:50,584
但它能每秒加速1米。这很不错
But it will accelerate at one metre per second. And that's good.

387
00:24:50,585 --> 00:24:52,705
这意味着上面的乘客不会因为急加速而摔下来
That means people standing up won't fall over.

388
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,184
车身外观如何？
So what about the styling?

389
00:24:58,185 --> 00:25:01,104
它的外观是由设计伦敦奥运会主火炬
Well, it was created by the same people

390
00:25:01,105 --> 00:25:04,104
的同一帮人所操刀的
who did the amazing Olympic cauldron.

391
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:06,385
这帮人同时也设计了这辆车
And they've done another great job on this.

392
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:14,864
从背后看，它的长相就像是The Human League乐队的菲尔奥克利的发型
（The Human League是1977年成立的英国流行乐队，菲尔奥克利是乐队主唱之一）
From the back, it looks like Phil Oakey's haircut,out of The Human League.

393
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:17,944
没错，它确实像个大盒子
All right, it is quite boxy.

394
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:20,664
但这是因为它是辆巴士
But that's because it's a bus.

395
00:25:20,665 --> 00:25:23,864
当你走进车内有一点变得很明显
A point that becomes obvious when you step inside.

396
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:27,144
在它的使用寿命期内，它的客运量估计超过400万人次
Over its lifetime, it's reckoned that about four million people

397
00:25:27,145 --> 00:25:30,544
所以它有些关键的设计用来对付这些问题
will get on and off it so it is a bit of a collection point

398
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:34,224
比如呕吐物，口水以及其它各种排泄物
for vomit and sputum and other bodily secretions.

399
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:38,384
在这些防滑的橡胶地板上，你能看见设计了许多深槽
So this floor, rubberised cork for grip, with drainage channels,

400
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:40,504
这些就是排污通道
so that the blood runs out.

401
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,824
车上有三个进出门和两个上下楼梯
There are three doorways and two staircases

402
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:48,464
这样小青年们就能快速地窜上去了
so that desperate teenagers can get upstairs as quickly as possible.

403
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:52,984
车内还配备了16台监控摄像头
There are 16 CCTV security cameras on board,

404
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,784
并且这些座椅，是受到老款巴士的影响
and this upholster,which is inspired by that used

405
00:25:55,785 --> 00:26:00,024
而设计的，所以看起来更加亲切，坐上去也同以前一样舒服
on the original Routemaster, so that we find it comforting and familiar.

406
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,184
最后还有这个，我最喜欢的设计
And then there's this,which I particularly like.

407
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,664
这块屏幕能告诉你上层的座位
This screen tells you when you get on the bus

408
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:06,544
是否满员
whether or not the top deck is full,

409
00:26:06,545 --> 00:26:09,745
所以二层满员的时候你不用白白跑上去再跑下来
so you don't waste your life going up and down the stairs.

410
00:26:11,385 --> 00:26:12,904
说到操控性
Now, handling.

411
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,624
在这样的道路上驾驶一辆超级跑车，你会吓得手心出汗
On a road like this, in a supercar,you'd be clammy-handed

412
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:20,624
但是在这辆车上，我很轻松
and frightened,but in my bus, I was very relaxed.

413
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,225
♪我在遥望，月亮之上...♪
♪ Da-da, da-da-da... ♪

414
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:28,145
这引起了我的思考。如果把这辆车开上赛道会怎样？
And this got me thinking. How would the bus cope with a track day?

415
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:40,904
现在各位观众估计在猜测我们是不是又要来一场疯狂的
Now you might think we're just being deliberately silly

416
00:26:40,905 --> 00:26:43,024
公交碰碰车比赛之类的玩意，但是，是这样吗？
in a Top Gear, sort of, way,but are we?

417
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:47,384
因为NBFL有许多赛车的特点
Because the NBFL has a lot of features that you'd want in a track day car.

418
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:52,264
比如它是后置引擎，就像保时捷911一样，它是后轮驱动
It's rear-engined, like a Porsche 911, it's rear wheel drive.

419
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:56,505
它有巨大的轮胎。当我们来到车的前端
It has massive tyres. And then if we move down to the front...

420
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:04,824
我们有着极度开阔的视野，一个非常
we find excellent all-round visibility, a lofty,

421
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,664
有利于驾驶的位置
commanding driving position

422
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:09,185
这能让我在任何弯道中都极具竞争力
that will give me a good view of all the bends.

423
00:27:11,905 --> 00:27:14,744
不幸的是，虽然看上去很适合赛道
Unfortunately, while that sounded good in the paddock,

424
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:16,265
但还是有些问题的
there were some issues.

425
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,025
六点钟方向
Bandits on my six.

426
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:26,505
小混混！
Yobbo!

427
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:32,984
在直线上，它慢得令人发指
On the straights, for instance,it was woefully slow.

428
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,905
跑快点啊！
More speed!

429
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:43,785
但在弯道里，你能开的和普通巴士司机一样霸道
But in the corners, you could at least behave like a bus driver.

430
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:48,104
我把保时捷挡在线路之外
I've shut the door on the Porsche.

431
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:50,905
你那小身板在这里没用！
Your Oyster card is about to expire!

432
00:27:58,225 --> 00:28:00,065
冲线！
And across the line!

433
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:03,265
谢谢
Thank you.

434
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:10,865
我从没在赛道上跑得这么欢
I have never enjoyed my time on a race track as much as that.

435
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:18,984
实际上，我在这车里的一整天都很享受。当然也有些缺点
In fact, I enjoyed my whole day with the bus. There are a few drawbacks.

436
00:28:18,985 --> 00:28:21,584
比如停车，油耗，倒车等等
Parking,fuel consumption, reversing,

437
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:25,064
但同样的问题也困扰着像布加迪威龙这样的超级跑车
but all that is true of the Bugatti Veyron, as well.

438
00:28:25,065 --> 00:28:28,864
好的方面，这车很宽敞，很有个性
On the plus side,it's roomy, it's distinctive,

439
00:28:28,865 --> 00:28:31,105
驾驶感也很出色
and it's extremely nice to drive.

440
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:37,185
所有这一切，都使它堪称一辆超级巴士
All in all,I think it would make a super car.

441
00:28:43,865 --> 00:28:46,824
等等
Hang on.

442
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,864
等等。什么？
Hang on a minute. What?

443
00:28:49,865 --> 00:28:53,744
你是不是五感尽失了？
Have you completely taken leave of your senses?

444
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:58,544
你说这家伙是这家伙的替代者？
Are you seriously proposing THIS as an alternative to THIS?

445
00:28:58,545 --> 00:29:03,344
不，这么看，哈蒙德，听我说。艾伦·休格(英国的亿万富翁),他是个富豪
No, look, Hammond, let me explain.Lord Sir Sugar, he is a wealthy man,

446
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:07,264
但他对0-60英里加速两秒以内的事情没兴趣，对吧？
but he's not interested in doing nought to 60 in two seconds, is he?

447
00:29:07,265 --> 00:29:10,784
如果他有一辆这车，他就能招待好他的小伙伴们
If he had one of these,he could take all his mates, well,

448
00:29:10,785 --> 00:29:12,984
如果他有小伙伴的话，并且度过愉快的一天
if he's got any,and have a lovely day out.

449
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,904
这很难证实，对吧？
It's hardly practical, is it?

450
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:18,664
不，哈蒙德，我认为梅说明了一件事。噢，看在上帝的份上...
No, Hammond, I think he's onto something. Oh, for God's sake...

451
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:20,904
不，不，如果你想要一辆雷克萨斯LFA
No, no, because if you wanted a Lexus LFA,

452
00:29:20,905 --> 00:29:23,624
但你又是一个计划生育政策的反对者
but you'd had a papal attitude to birth control -

453
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:26,865
换言之你有很多孩子 - 这就是你的不二选择
a lot of children - this is ideal.

454
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:29,064
没错。你也不用自己开车
Exactly right.And you don't have to drive,

455
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:31,144
你能找个人为你开车
you could get somebody to drive it for you.

456
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:33,304
我们通常把这人叫做，我不知道该怎么说，公交司机。
You could call him the,I don't know, the bus driver.

457
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:36,504
噢，搞什么名堂！等等，这个主意怎么样？
Oh, for crying out loud!Hang on, how's this for an idea?

458
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:39,424
你等地方政府买下这车
You get the local authority to buy the bus

459
00:29:39,425 --> 00:29:42,904
然后你就可以乘坐它了,你唯一要做的只是每次上车刷卡而已
and then you can just use it now and then in return for a small fee.

460
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:45,704
不，詹姆斯，那就变成共产主义了
No, James, that would be communism.

461
00:29:45,705 --> 00:29:49,504
总之，现在又到了我们的明星驾驶廉价车环节
Anyway, it's time now to put a star in our reasonably-priced car.

462
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:52,944
今晚我的嘉宾是一个住在英国的澳洲人
Now, my guest tonight is an Australian who lives in Britain,

463
00:29:52,945 --> 00:29:55,744
但不寻常的是，他不在酒吧工作
but, unusually,he doesn't work in a pub.

464
00:29:55,745 --> 00:29:59,344
相反,他的工作是在
Instead, he works in the marketing department

465
00:29:59,345 --> 00:30:03,984
一家大型能量饮料制造公司的营销部门，并且刚刚提交了辞职信
of a large energy drinks company and he's just handed his notice in.

466
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:06,465
女士们先生们，欢迎马克韦伯
Ladies and gentlemen,please welcome Mark Webber.

467
00:30:11,065 --> 00:30:12,584
马克韦伯！
Mark Webber!

468
00:30:12,585 --> 00:30:14,225
你好吗？
How are you?

469
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:21,784
请坐。请坐
Have a seat. Have a seat.

470
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:25,624
最受欢迎的人物，我说过，在F1围场内
One of the most popular figures,I say, in Formula 1.

471
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:28,104
我们有如此多的相似处
Now, we have so much in common.

472
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:34,544
我们有相同的体重，我了解的。你们笑啥？
We have the same body fat index,I know that. Why are you laughing?

473
00:30:34,545 --> 00:30:36,904
一模一样。但最主要的是我们有共同之处
Exactly the same. But the main thing we have in common,

474
00:30:36,905 --> 00:30:39,824
除了相同的体重
apart from the same body fat index,

475
00:30:39,825 --> 00:30:43,624
还有爱好骑单车
is cycling.

476
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,504
我现在是个骑自行车的人
I'm now a cyclist.

477
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:48,344
我听说这是你的新爱好
I hear it's a new passion for you.

478
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:50,984
而你，当然，所有人都知道你是个单车运动员
And you, of course,are well-known as a cyclist.

479
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:54,544
你参加了很多比赛。我今年也参加了几次比赛
You do a lot of competing. I've done a little bit over the years.

480
00:30:54,545 --> 00:30:56,744
有人说你是最合适的车手
Somebody said you are the fittest driver.

481
00:30:56,745 --> 00:30:59,304
我有合适的体型。我认为所有的人都适合。
I'm in reasonable shape.I think all the guys are fit now.

482
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:01,384
如果你是最合适的F1车手
If you're the fittest Formula 1 driver,

483
00:31:01,385 --> 00:31:03,824
你就是这个世界上所有运动的最合适运动员
you've got to be one of the fittest athletes.

484
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:07,344
如果我们做了很多不同的尝试,我想,是这么回事
If we did lots and lots of different challenges, I think, yeah.

485
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:10,584
那样真不错。你可以试试不同的运动
That would be good.Let's get you all playing all the different sports.

486
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:11,944
你玩足球吗？欧洲足球还是你们澳洲那种愚蠢的足球？
Do you play football?Ours or your silly football?

487
00:31:11,945 --> 00:31:13,704
不要聊狮子巡回赛（橄榄球赛事，四年一届）
We won't get onto the Lions and Australia.

488
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,584
说点别的
We'll leave that well alone.

489
00:31:15,585 --> 00:31:19,184
这里有了解的人。有人知道你说的是什么
Somebody's here. Somebody understands what you're on about.

490
00:31:19,185 --> 00:31:21,705
狮子队和小袋鼠队，我们很喜欢这两支队伍
Lions and Wallabies,we really enjoyed that.

491
00:31:23,345 --> 00:31:24,305
还有灰烬杯（灰烬杯板球赛，英国和澳洲之间的世界板球顶级赛事）
And the Ashes.

492
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:29,584
你一定很喜欢住在这里的这最后几年
You must have really enjoyed living here these last few years.

493
00:31:29,585 --> 00:31:32,024
我认为上届灰烬杯很精彩
I thought the previous Ashes was quite a good series.

494
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:35,105
我的意思是,英国队的南非裔球员表现的很好
I mean, all the South Africans played well for you guys.

495
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:40,264
你骑车的总里程数有多少了？骑车？
So how much mileage have you done on the bike? On the bike?

496
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,664
我已经骑了...三
I've done... three.

497
00:31:42,665 --> 00:31:44,544
3英里（4.8公里）
Three miles.

498
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:47,344
我对单车运动有一点要说明，这是个，这么说吧
One thing I will say about cycling is, it is, well,

499
00:31:47,345 --> 00:31:49,424
这是一项很危险的运动
it's pretty dangerous.

500
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:53,384
这么多年来，你也有过很多次赛道事故，是这样吧
Over the years, you've had a number of car accidents, let's be honest.

501
00:31:53,385 --> 00:31:55,024
如果你参加比赛，你就会遇上撞车
If you race cars, you'll crash cars.

502
00:31:55,025 --> 00:31:57,664
我们有张事故照片。是勒芒24小时耐力赛的一次事故
We've got a photograph of a crash.I believe it was at Le Mans.

503
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:01,104
一张静态照片。没错，这就是你以前驾驶的奔驰赛车
A still photo.Yeah, this is you in a Mercedes.

504
00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:05,025
我刚说赛车事故，这看起来实际上是场空难。当时怎么回事？
I say car crash, that is a plane crash going on. How did that happen?

505
00:32:06,065 --> 00:32:09,424
实际上，在那条赛道上，90年代末期，那些赛车安全性很糟糕
Actually, in that era, the late 90s,the cars were super unsafe,

506
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:12,304
所以很多赛车都飞起来过。这是常事
so a lot of cars were flying.Just the regulations.

507
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,224
所以当时你在那辆车里，想些什么...?
So you're sitting in there,thinking...?

508
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:17,624
我当时想，显然我失去控制了
I'm thinking,obviously I'm now out of control.

509
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,865
至于你信不信，我反正信了，当时我就是失去控制了
Believe it or not,I'm now out of control.

510
00:32:20,945 --> 00:32:24,984
就像飚车的年轻人那样，那时我已经失去了对车的控制
As arrogant as us boys are,I have now lost control of that car.

511
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:29,504
就是这么回事。你当时还踩着刹车吗？
That's gone. Do you find yourself in a situation like that braking?

512
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:32,705
刹车灯还亮着，大概，没错
The brakelights will still be on, probably, yes.

513
00:32:33,905 --> 00:32:36,144
为什么还不减速？
"Why isn't it slowing down?"

514
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:39,664
之后还有一次，当然，是在F1里的那次碰撞
And then, of course, that was the big Formula 1 airborne one.

515
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:42,264
是在瓦伦西亚吗？是的。那是一次很严重的撞车
Was that Valencia? Yeah.It was quite a big crash.

516
00:32:42,265 --> 00:32:43,704
我们有段录像
We've got the footage here,

517
00:32:43,705 --> 00:32:47,505
给各位重温一下韦伯的那段经历，你人生中最刺激的一刻，是的
just to remind everybody of Mark,one of your finest hours, really.

518
00:32:57,945 --> 00:32:59,544
又看了一遍，我觉得...
Again, I find myself...

519
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,784
当时那一瞬间你大脑里都在想些什么
What does go through your mind apart from,

520
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:04,544
哇噢，那就像坐游乐场里的过山车一样？
"Wow, it's like a fairground ride"?

521
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:08,464
你只是需要离莲花赛车远一点，伙计，这就是你需要做的
You've just got to stay away from Lotuses mate,that's the long and short of it.

522
00:33:08,465 --> 00:33:10,864
通过这两场事故
The thing about both of those accidents,

523
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,904
我认为首先，你一定受到了一点...
I think the first one,you suffered a little bit of...

524
00:33:13,905 --> 00:33:16,464
我有些脑震荡，脖子也有点伤
I had some concussion, neck problems.

525
00:33:16,465 --> 00:33:20,224
是那次吗，那次F1的撞车？我很走运
That one, though, the one in the Formula 1 car? I was lucky.

526
00:33:20,225 --> 00:33:22,704
我踩断了制动踏板,实际上。这就是当时发生的事情
I snapped the brake pedal,actually. So that was about it.

527
00:33:22,705 --> 00:33:25,024
通常我们不在那里踩刹车
Which is unusual to do from that side.

528
00:33:25,025 --> 00:33:27,504
需要很大的力量，和勇气
A lot of power required, adrenaline.

529
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,544
你实际上还踩坏了你的...？断了。突然断裂
You actually broke it with your own...? Snapped it. Just popped it.

530
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:33,544
什么，你用脚踩断了刹车？是的
What, just with the force of your own foot? Exactly.

531
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,464
所以你从这两场事故中一路走来，令人印象深刻
So you walk away from both those accidents, which is remarkable,

532
00:33:36,465 --> 00:33:39,504
2008年开始你还参加自行车比赛
and yet you go cycling in 2008,

533
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:44,664
撞到一辆日产都灵，我记得。那辆日产赢了，伙计，日产赢了
bump into a Nissan Torino,I believe. It won, mate, it won.

534
00:33:44,665 --> 00:33:47,624
日产赢了。你撞断了你的腿？
It won. And you broke your leg?

535
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,144
是的。和肩膀...
Yeah. Shoulder...

536
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:53,744
因为这是一个教育孩子们的好案例
Because this is what I think we need to impress upon children watching.

537
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:56,545
不要骑自行车。因为它们很危险
Don't get a bicycle.Because they're dangerous.

538
00:33:57,985 --> 00:34:02,145
现在，很显然，就像我们在介绍中说的那样，你已经确认不再参加明年的F1比赛
Now obviously, you've, as we said in the introduction, handed notice in.

539
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:07,944
为什么？你要去哪？你将要做些什么？
Why? Where are you going?What you going to do?

540
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,824
如今这个时间正适合我，伙计
Timing's right for me, mate.

541
00:34:09,825 --> 00:34:13,784
对于已经参加14年F1比赛的我来说，是时候调整一下了
Bit of a break from what I've been doing for the last 14 years.

542
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,664
我明年就去保时捷车队跑勒芒了，事实上
So I'm going to race with Porsche, actually.

543
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:18,784
我知道你一直很喜欢保时捷，对吧？
I know you love Porsches, don't you?

544
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:20,985
911是部好车！
The 911 is such an interesting car!

545
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:26,704
不，让我疑虑的是，你真觉得现在是你离开F1的最佳时机吗？
No, cos what worries me,do you think you're getting out at the right time of Formula 1?

546
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:29,224
如今F1有了不稳定的轮胎
Now that we've got the tyres going off like they do,

547
00:34:29,225 --> 00:34:30,904
这是不是使得比赛变得乏味了？
is that getting a bit wearisome?

548
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:33,464
你坐进赛车，赛车很棒，你也了解赛道
You're in the car, the car's going well, you know the track,

549
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:36,544
你在最佳的状态，并且你知道如果你全力驾驶的话
you're in the groove and you know that if you push hard,

550
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:39,224
你的轮胎会快速衰竭这样你就赢不了比赛了
your tyres will simply wear out and you can't win.

551
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:42,544
这很不同，伙计，和以前比较起来
It is very different, mate,from how it used to be.

552
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:45,944
但现实就是如此，所以我们要不断学习并掌握它
But that's the way it is, we've got to learn and get on with it.

553
00:34:45,945 --> 00:34:49,104
你在F1里要学会进步
But you've got to be able to push.In Formula 1,

554
00:34:49,105 --> 00:34:53,184
全心全意地投入其中.就应该这样
it's about us boys absolutely on the limits all the time. It should be.

555
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:55,544
明年F1规则会有大改变
There's a big regulation change next year.

556
00:34:55,545 --> 00:34:59,824
赛车会变得更加省油。1.6升排量的引擎？
We're going to have to save fuel.1.6 litre engines?

557
00:34:59,825 --> 00:35:03,744
我想说我的福特科蒂娜也是1.6升的排气量
I mean, my Ford Cortina had a 1.6 litre engine.

558
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:06,265
所以你会想念你的队友吗？
So are you going to miss your team-mate?

559
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:15,985
我会不会想念维特尔？
Am I going to miss Seb?

560
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:21,504
大概不会太想他，不会
Probably not a huge amount, no.

561
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:24,744
在一个竞争的环境里，总有一点点不和谐的气氛
In a competitive environment, there's always going to be a bit of needle.

562
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:28,584
我们之间有很多恩怨，显然，但那都是过去时了
There's a lot of history between us two, obviously, that's gone before.

563
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:33,345
是不是从今年马来西亚站开始他就变得不太听话了？
Did it start in Malaysia when he suddenly lost the ability to hear?

564
00:35:34,905 --> 00:35:37,784
车队对他说“不要超过韦伯”
It was basically "Don't overtake Mark",

565
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:41,464
他听到了除了“不要”之外的每一个字
and then he heard everything apart from the "don't".

566
00:35:41,465 --> 00:35:45,185
我想说，你是个澳洲人。你是否曾经有过一种冲动想要...?
I mean, you're an Aussie.Have you never felt tempted to...?

567
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:49,624
这是为了报我那一箭之仇
"This is for Gallipoli, blam!"

568
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:53,104
很多人都说是的。我有些不安了
A lot of people are saying yes.I'm a bit concerned.

569
00:35:53,105 --> 00:35:56,345
我老爸曾经教导我“不要欺负小朋友”，所以...
My dad always says,"You shouldn't hit boys, mate", so...

570
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,065
说得好
Good one.

571
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:05,664
现在你回到我们的节目是为了刷新上次的记录
Now you're here for the second time, in fact.

572
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:08,304
不同的演播室，所有的东西都不同了
Different studio,everything's a bit different.

573
00:36:08,305 --> 00:36:11,144
今天有点紧张。你去过老演播室？是的
I was a bit nervous today.Were you in the old studio? Yeah.

574
00:36:11,145 --> 00:36:13,265
你看上去比原来老了一半
You actually looked half-decent back then.

575
00:36:16,945 --> 00:36:19,344
我要退休了，我真的要退休了
I've gone, I've absolutely gone.

576
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,264
我头发也白了，伙计。你也白了
I've got grey, too, mate.You've got grey.

577
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:23,944
理查德哈蒙德头发没白
Richard Hammond hasn't gone grey.

578
00:36:23,945 --> 00:36:26,064
这真奇怪。难以置信
It's really weird.That's incredible.

579
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:28,784
我都不知道他怎么保养的
I don't know how he's keeping it at bay.

580
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:32,304
闲话少叙，让我们看看你的赛道表现
Anyway, let's find out how you got on on your laps.

581
00:36:32,305 --> 00:36:35,624
你以前来过一次，说实话...
You came here once before and, let's be honest...

582
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:37,984
那次下着大雨，我跑的一团糟
It was chucking it down and I was nowhere.

583
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:41,384
你上次成绩是1分47秒，但那次雨真的很大
You were 1.47, but it was the wettest day in human history.

584
00:36:41,385 --> 00:36:44,904
但这次没有下雨。赛道情况很不错
Well, today was not raining.Very good conditions.

585
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:48,664
赛道相当理想，那正是铃木利亚纳最适宜的温度
Good conditions, the right temperatures for a Suzuki Liana.

586
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,264
谁想看看韦伯的单圈？
Who'd like to have a look at this lap?

587
00:36:51,265 --> 00:36:52,544
是的！
Yeah!

588
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:55,425
让我们看看。放录像，看看韦伯跑的怎么样
Let's have a look. Come on, Mark.Let's have a look at the lap.

589
00:36:57,425 --> 00:37:02,504
好的，出发了。我要超过你们
Righto, here we go.Coming to get you.

590
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:04,544
刘易斯和塞巴斯蒂安
Lewis and Sebastian.

591
00:37:04,545 --> 00:37:08,304
好的，他们俩是标杆成绩。来到第一弯
Right, those are the two targets.The first corner.

592
00:37:08,305 --> 00:37:12,465
走线很漂亮也很宽。你的走线很有意思
Nice and wide on the way. And it is interesting how you lot all do that.

593
00:37:13,705 --> 00:37:15,985
看看利亚纳，多么棒的一辆车
Look at the Liana, what a machine.

594
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,944
F1车手都怎么回事？
What is it with Formula 1 drivers?

595
00:37:22,945 --> 00:37:25,784
Kimi上次跑到这里还在欣赏那边的直升飞机
Kimi was looking at the helicopters and planes

596
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:30,504
现在你居然整理仪容。你要去哪？
and now you're adjusting your clothing. Where are you going?

597
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:33,184
集中注意力。这方向盘真是太灵敏了
Pay attention.The steering's very responsive.

598
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:36,464
这拉风的特性会帮助你取得好成绩。好的，锤子弯
That'll help with your time.Right, Hammerhead.

599
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:39,984
走线紧凑些，紧凑些。真可怕，锤子弯
Keep it tight, keep it in.It's horrible, Hammerhead.

600
00:37:39,985 --> 00:37:41,824
这走的是什么路线啊？
What's that?

601
00:37:41,825 --> 00:37:43,904
你在这段会有很强的抓地力。这里铺了新的沥青
You keep the grip up.There's new asphalt there.

602
00:37:43,905 --> 00:37:45,865
这里抓地力很棒，真的非常棒
It's good grip on that,really good grip.

603
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:52,344
不要在这里减速
Don't scrub any speed through these fast ones.

604
00:37:52,345 --> 00:37:54,585
轻柔的转向，来了
Turning lightly, here we go.

605
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:02,704
来了，上次休杰克曼就是这样。哦嚯！
Here we are,the Hugh Jackman. Ooh!

606
00:38:02,705 --> 00:38:05,424
切弯漂亮
Cutting it nicely.

607
00:38:05,425 --> 00:38:08,864
你是怎么保持的？看看这个弯的速度多快啊！
How do you carry? Look how much speed you've got going into that!

608
00:38:08,865 --> 00:38:11,904
很震撼。不错，但有点跳动，实际上
That's impressive.Well, bound to be, really.

609
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:14,824
这里，不，我不会在这里减档
And here, no, I wouldn't have changed down there

610
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,545
但是一圈完毕，冲线了
but there we are, across the line.

611
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:22,265
我刚才对你说“我不会在这里减档”
I just said "I wouldn't have changed down there" to YOU!

612
00:38:24,265 --> 00:38:29,064
最后一个弯你用二档过的？是的
Second gear in the last corner,second? Yeah.

613
00:38:29,065 --> 00:38:31,144
我在Gambon弯用三档。你呢？
I use third in Gambon. Do you?

614
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:34,784
好吧，准确来说这一切都结束了，所以现在讨论也没什么意义
Well, on the basis that it's the end, so it doesn't really matter

615
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:37,624
如果你那时换档。之后会没有动力传递给三档
if you roll it or burst.There's no weight transfer in third.

616
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,464
我希望把驱动力都传递给前轮。重心转移给前轮？
I want to get the weight on the front tyre. The weight on the front?

617
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:44,304
你看，我点刹了。点刹？带了一点点
You see, I trail break.Trail breaking? A little bit.

618
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:47,264
但对于克服惯性还是不够。只是让车能更好入弯
Still not enough inertia.It just gets the weight of the nose.

619
00:38:47,265 --> 00:38:50,225
等下我会给你好好上一课。至少我能做到的事情
I'll give you some lessons after.The least I can do.

620
00:38:51,345 --> 00:38:53,864
不管怎样，你猜你会排在哪？
Anyway, where do you think?

621
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:56,384
显然，你说了你是要打败维特尔和汉密尔顿的
Obviously, you said you were going for Sebastian and Lewis,

622
00:38:56,385 --> 00:38:59,064
谁在最顶端。谁就是我的目标
who are right up at the top.That was the goal.

623
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:02,185
好吧，我有你的成绩。我要看看。等等
Well, I've got the time here. I shall have a look. Hang on a minute.

624
00:39:03,585 --> 00:39:06,704
我很喜欢你们这群F1车手，事实上
I love the way that Formula 1 drivers, actually,

625
00:39:06,705 --> 00:39:11,664
你看起来对此相当期待。这真是相当有趣
it's like you really care about this. Cos it is quite funny.

626
00:39:11,665 --> 00:39:15,104
我还记得巴里切罗当时知道他是最快的人之后那种兴奋的表情
I mean Rubens was really dead chuffed when he was fastest.

627
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:17,984
他跑出去到处散发T恤衫，上面写着“我就是击败Stig的...”
He was running around handing out,"I am the beat..."

628
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:20,104
他确实那么干了，他也给了我一件
He was, he gave me one.

629
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:21,705
不论如何，马克韦伯...
Anyway, Mark Webber...

630
00:39:23,785 --> 00:39:27,065
你的成绩。好吧，我首先要宣布一个坏消息
You did it. Well, I'm going to start with the bad news.

631
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:31,705
真的吗？是的，你不是最快的
Really? Yeah. You're not fastest.

632
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:38,624
所以，当我说出那个成绩的时候，关键就在于
So, really, once we got that one out the way, the big question is,

633
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:39,625
这个德国人
ze German.

634
00:39:45,305 --> 00:39:49,304
你是否击败了这个做出1分44秒成绩的德国人？
Did you beat ze German,who did a 1.44 dead?

635
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:52,984
前三差距很小。都离1分44秒很近
It's quite tight between those three.It is very tight in the 1.44s.

636
00:39:52,985 --> 00:39:56,345
真的很接近。所以马克韦伯，你的成绩是1分...
It's all very tight.So, Mark Webber, you did 1...

637
00:39:58,345 --> 00:39:59,784
40...
40...

638
00:39:59,785 --> 00:40:01,465
接下来这个数字是关键
The next number's important.

639
00:40:06,465 --> 00:40:07,825
3.噢！
Three. Ooh!

640
00:40:10,345 --> 00:40:11,385
你击败了维特尔
You beat Seb.

641
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:16,585
只落后汉密尔顿0.2秒
Only .2 off Lewis.

642
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:23,865
这真是...
That...

643
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:26,825
我估计到会这样
I reckon that did it.

644
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:31,984
我估计到你会采纳我给你的建议
I reckon if you'd just taken my advice

645
00:40:31,985 --> 00:40:34,064
最后一个弯要用三档
about third at the final corner.

646
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:37,624
事实上，你没有比汉密尔顿更快，但你也没戴耳钉
The thing is, you're not faster than Lewis but you don't have an earring.

647
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:39,824
这样。戴耳钉会慢0.3秒，是吧？
OK. That's worth 3/10, isn't it?

648
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:43,024
0.3秒，是的，戴耳钉
It's got to be 3/10,yeah, with his earring.

649
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:47,505
但你终于用同一辆车击败了维特尔
But you have beaten Sebastian Vettel in the same car.

650
00:40:48,705 --> 00:40:50,745
女士们先生们，马克韦伯！
Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Webber!

651
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:57,064
真不错
Tremendous.

652
00:40:57,065 --> 00:40:58,984
好的，正如这些年我们知道的那样
Now, for years we've known

653
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:02,504
捷豹正在研发一款新的小型运动跑车
that Jaguar was working on a new small sports car.

654
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:04,704
我们知道它将被称作F-type
We've known that it's going to be called the F-type

655
00:41:04,705 --> 00:41:07,664
我们对它抱有各种美好的幻想
and we had a pretty good idea of what it would be like.

656
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,064
是的，我们知道这将是一辆安静，舒适
Yeah, we knew that it was going to be quiet and comfortable

657
00:41:11,065 --> 00:41:14,224
内敛的小车，并且内饰充满了传统风格的皮饰
and restrained and that the interior would be full of traditional leather

658
00:41:14,225 --> 00:41:17,224
木头以及苔藓
and wood and moss.

659
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,345
我们猜的对吗？
So were we right?

660
00:41:42,705 --> 00:41:45,504
简而言之，不对
In short, no.

661
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:47,265
我们猜错了
We were not right.

662
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:59,745
它是一部限制级作品，一辆凶猛的怪兽
It's an X-rated,hardcore monster...

663
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:02,865
为精神错乱晚期人士量身打造
for the terminally unhinged.

664
00:42:08,745 --> 00:42:13,024
它有如此宽广的排气声浪
It's got such a wide range of intoxicating noises.

665
00:42:13,025 --> 00:42:15,985
当你升档时，它就像头河马
When you change up,it snorts like a hippo.

666
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:20,745
当你踩下油门，它就开始演奏
And when you put your foot down, it bellows.

667
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:23,704
当你再次减挡时...
And when you take it off again...

668
00:42:23,705 --> 00:42:24,705
排气声
RUMBLING

669
00:42:25,785 --> 00:42:27,785
你听过这样的排气声浪吗？
Have you heard a soundtrack like that?

670
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:32,665
这声浪仿佛来自60年代！
That is the sound of the '60s right there!

671
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:40,704
如果你按下这个小按钮
And if you push this little button here,

672
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:45,585
你就启动了运动排气系统，这会让它变得更响亮
you engage the sports exhaust system, which makes it even louder.

673
00:42:51,985 --> 00:42:55,105
它不会咆哮也不会咬人
It's not all bark and no bite, either.

674
00:42:55,565 --> 00:42:58,424
机械增压的3.0升V6引擎拥有
The 3L V6 engine is supercharged

675
00:42:58,425 --> 00:43:03,305
375马力的强劲动力
and delivers 375 fire-spitting horse powers.

676
00:43:05,225 --> 00:43:09,144
0-60英里加速时间4.8秒
It does 0-60 in 4.8 seconds.

677
00:43:09,145 --> 00:43:12,025
极速171英里每小时（275公里）
Top speed, 171.

678
00:43:19,785 --> 00:43:22,505
这辆车甚至还不是捷豹最快的版本
And this isn't even the fast version.

679
00:43:24,145 --> 00:43:29,504
如果你需要，捷豹会为你换成488匹马力的V8引擎
If you want,Jaguar will sell you a 488hp V8.

680
00:43:29,505 --> 00:43:31,104
虽然我不会对此感到不满
I wouldn't bother, though,

681
00:43:31,105 --> 00:43:34,424
因为当我驾驶这辆车的时候，我就一直这么认为
because at no point while I've been driving this, have I thought,

682
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:37,065
“是的，但我希望它要是能更刺激一点就好了”
"Yeah, but I wish it was a bit more exciting."

683
00:43:41,505 --> 00:43:45,424
现在，你可能会猜想这样一辆又吵又粗暴的车
Now, you would imagine that a car this loud and this brutal

684
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:49,064
会是一辆很简陋粗糙的作品
would be as luxurious as a Methodist's coal house.

685
00:43:49,065 --> 00:43:50,865
但是，你错了
But, no.

686
00:44:01,145 --> 00:44:03,224
车顶能在你以30英里（48公里）
The roof can be raised or lowered,

687
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:06,545
时速行驶时自由打开和关闭
even when you're going 30 miles an hour.

688
00:44:07,785 --> 00:44:09,745
按钮全部是镀铜材质
The switches are bronzed.

689
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:12,625
座椅也是电动可调的
The seats are electric.

690
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:22,745
你还能调节车内的氛围灯光颜色
And you can choose what shade of mood lighting you'd like.

691
00:44:26,785 --> 00:44:29,664
内饰，做得很精致
The interior, then,is nicely thought out,

692
00:44:29,665 --> 00:44:33,705
但是这和它的外观没有啥联系
but it is nothing compared to the exterior.

693
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:41,265
我认为这是我见过的最漂亮的车型
I think this is one of the best-looking cars ever made.

694
00:44:44,305 --> 00:44:48,944
所以，这是辆漂亮的，疯狂的，粗鲁的，很吵的车
So, it's beautiful and mad and thrilling and loud.

695
00:44:48,945 --> 00:44:50,505
对此还有很多要说的
And there's more.

696
00:44:52,145 --> 00:44:56,304
如今许多车给人感觉就像是笔记本电脑，但这辆车不是
A lot of cars these days feel like laptops, but this doesn't.

697
00:44:56,305 --> 00:44:58,304
是的，这辆车你也能进入电脑
Yes, you can go into the computer

698
00:44:58,305 --> 00:45:01,384
选择变速箱和引擎的模式
and alter the characteristics of the gearbox and the engine

699
00:45:01,385 --> 00:45:04,184
以及调节转向和悬挂，但另一方面
and the steering and suspension, but that said,

700
00:45:04,185 --> 00:45:06,304
这车没有双离合器
there's no double clutch gearbox.

701
00:45:06,305 --> 00:45:09,344
有的仅是一台平顺的八速自动变速器
It's just a smooth,eight-speed auto.

702
00:45:09,345 --> 00:45:11,304
这里也没有6档牵引力控制系统
There's no six-way traction control,

703
00:45:11,305 --> 00:45:14,304
没有复杂的折叠硬顶
there's no complicated folding metal roof.

704
00:45:14,305 --> 00:45:15,705
它比你想象的还要简单
It's much simpler than that.

705
00:45:18,505 --> 00:45:20,584
前置引擎，后轮驱动
Engine at the front,drive to the rear

706
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:23,345
再加上一个坐在里面的驾驶员
and a big, smiling piece of meat in the middle.

707
00:45:29,345 --> 00:45:33,184
底盘很出色，刹车也很出色，转向系统也同样出色
The chassis is epic, and so are the brakes, and so's the steering.

708
00:45:33,185 --> 00:45:34,504
你有很大的抓地力
And you've got tons of locks,

709
00:45:34,505 --> 00:45:37,585
所以当你超过操控极限时，它能很轻易的把你救回来
so if you do get it out of shape,it's easy to get it back again.

710
00:45:40,665 --> 00:45:43,705
在许多方面，它把我的思绪带回了宝马M3并且...
In many ways, it puts me in mind of a BMW M3 and that is...

711
00:45:45,985 --> 00:45:47,465
这是个非常高的评价
That is high praise.

712
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:52,504
除了它不是一辆宝马之外
Except, it's not a BMW.

713
00:45:52,505 --> 00:45:53,785
这是辆捷豹
It's a Jag.

714
00:45:57,265 --> 00:46:00,864
我真希望我能就此结束介绍这车，但不幸的是
And I wish I could end it there,but, unfortunately,

715
00:46:00,865 --> 00:46:04,785
还有两件事需要补充一下
there are one or two issues that need mentioning.

716
00:46:13,305 --> 00:46:15,424
我刚刚完成了我的一周大采购
I've just done my weekly shop.

717
00:46:15,425 --> 00:46:17,425
我买了一些果酱...
I bought some jam...

718
00:46:19,665 --> 00:46:20,785
一杯牛奶...
some milk...

719
00:46:23,185 --> 00:46:24,465
一袋糖...
some sugar...

720
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:26,865
还有一些黄油
and some butter.

721
00:46:28,505 --> 00:46:30,704
遗憾的是，我没办法再多买点东西了
Sadly, I wasn't able to buy any more than that,

722
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:34,984
因为如果你给你的捷豹配备了一个备胎的话
because if you buy your Jag with a spare wheel,

723
00:46:34,985 --> 00:46:37,425
这将是你后备箱的样子
this is what the boot looks like.

724
00:46:39,825 --> 00:46:44,784
捷豹怎么能在开了无数会议之后认为这是能被接受的设计？
How could they have a meeting and decide that THAT was acceptable?

725
00:46:44,785 --> 00:46:46,824
这真是蠢透了！
It's just madness!

726
00:46:46,825 --> 00:46:49,105
还有一点 - 那就是价格 
And there's another problem - the price.

727
00:46:52,265 --> 00:46:57,504
我曾猜想V6版本的车大概会卖5万英镑（47万人民币）
I was expecting the V6 version to cost around £50,000.

728
00:46:57,505 --> 00:47:02,304
但实际上，它卖到了几乎68000英镑（63.9万人民币）
But actually, it's almost £68,000.

729
00:47:02,305 --> 00:47:07,104
而V8版本的价格更是开到了让人泪奔的80000英镑（75.1万人民币）
And the V8 is an eye-watering £80,000.

730
00:47:07,105 --> 00:47:10,225
但更大的问题，是在郊外公路上的驾乘感
But the biggest problem,by a country mile, is the ride.

731
00:47:11,225 --> 00:47:14,344
这条路看起来似乎很平坦
This road appears to be completely smooth,

732
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:17,384
但实际上我的感觉是正行驶在一条...
but it feels like I'm driving...

733
00:47:17,385 --> 00:47:20,504
不，我不像是在开车，我感觉更像是在滑旱冰
No, not driving,it feels like I'm roller-skating,

734
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,704
穿着一双钢制滑轮的旱冰鞋
over a piece of corrugated iron.

735
00:47:22,705 --> 00:47:24,384
这感觉...呃！
It's just... urgh!

736
00:47:24,385 --> 00:47:27,304
当你在小镇上开的慢一点时会感觉更糟
And it's even worse when you go slowly in a town.

737
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:29,744
那简直是无法忍受的颠簸
That's just unbearably harsh.

738
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:32,144
这种调校完全没必要
And there's no need for it.

739
00:47:32,145 --> 00:47:36,624
当你有一个这么好的底盘，你根本没必要把悬挂调校得这么生硬
When you've got a chassis this good,you don't need hard suspension.

740
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:38,945
他们究竟是怎么想的？！
What were they thinking of?!

741
00:47:47,025 --> 00:47:50,505
可喜的是，不管怎样，当你开的越快，你的感觉就越好
Happily, however, the ride does get better the faster you go.

742
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:55,225
这就是说，有一个解决该问题的办法
Which means, there is a way round the problem.

743
00:47:56,745 --> 00:47:58,425
不要开得太慢
Don't drive slowly.

744
00:48:00,185 --> 00:48:01,945
开的越快越好
Drive fast.

745
00:48:07,465 --> 00:48:09,984
实话实说，在一辆这么漂亮的车里
Let's be honest,in a car that looks this good

746
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:14,744
声浪听起来也如此美妙，驾驶起来如此出色
and sounds this fantastic,and goes this well,

747
00:48:14,745 --> 00:48:17,025
没啥可抱怨的
that's no hardship.

748
00:48:22,345 --> 00:48:23,905
一点抱怨都没有
That is no hardship, at all.

749
00:48:34,505 --> 00:48:37,104
又一辆适合在赫特福德郡驾驶的好车
Another amazing road in Hertfordshire.

750
00:48:37,105 --> 00:48:39,424
你们应该经常去那驾驶
You should come there more often.

751
00:48:39,425 --> 00:48:45,184
无论如何，捷豹，大家都知道，如今是一家印度公司
Anyway, Jaguar, as I'm sure you know, is now an Indian company,

752
00:48:45,185 --> 00:48:48,544
但车辆的生产工作依旧在英国进行
but the cars are still made in Britain.

753
00:48:48,545 --> 00:48:51,384
同样的现状，一开始介绍的路虎也是如此
And so are the Range Rovers that we were talking about earlier,

754
00:48:51,385 --> 00:48:54,904
詹姆斯介绍的那辆巴士也是如此
and so is the bus that James thinks as a car.

755
00:48:54,905 --> 00:48:57,464
这就让我们开始思考
And that got us thinking.

756
00:48:57,465 --> 00:48:58,544
我们一直被灌输这样的理论
We're always been told

757
00:48:58,545 --> 00:49:00,784
英国的制造业早已消亡
that Britain's manufacturing industry is dead,

758
00:49:00,785 --> 00:49:02,384
我们不再制造任何东西
that we don't make stuff any more,

759
00:49:02,385 --> 00:49:05,264
所以我们自然也不再制造汽车
and that we certainly don't make vehicles.

760
00:49:05,265 --> 00:49:06,984
但是，真是这样吗？
But, do we?

761
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,344
好的，其实并不是这样，显然
Well, WE do, obviously.

762
00:49:09,345 --> 00:49:13,584
我们制造了这台先进的混合动力汽车，
We made this pioneering hybrid electric car, using technology

763
00:49:13,585 --> 00:49:16,224
如今这项技术风靡全球
that is now copied globally.

764
00:49:16,225 --> 00:49:19,824
我们也制造了这台伟大的气垫车
And we made the magnificent Hovervan,

765
00:49:19,825 --> 00:49:22,624
一台无与伦比的强悍机器
a machine of unparalleled capabilities,

766
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:25,264
质量无比可靠，使用中从未失败
many of which were not faked in any way, at all.

767
00:49:25,265 --> 00:49:29,224
之后是一流的P45
And then there was the superb P45.

768
00:49:29,225 --> 00:49:31,144
其实很烂
Which was terrible.

769
00:49:31,145 --> 00:49:32,984
好吧，确实出过一两次小问题
Well, it had one or two issues.

770
00:49:32,985 --> 00:49:34,464
是啊，都是致命的
Yeah, it was lethal.

771
00:49:34,465 --> 00:49:36,464
好吧，但致命的只有一次而已
Yeah, being lethal was one of the issues.

772
00:49:36,465 --> 00:49:38,544
但它是纯正的英国制造
But it was British built.

773
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:41,504
所以我们就开始思考，还有什么是我们英国制造的？
And we were wondering, what else is?

774
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:45,904
因此，在本次20季的最后一集节目里
And so, for the finale of the last programme of the series,

775
00:49:45,905 --> 00:49:48,265
我觉得我们应该找出答案
we thought we should find out.

776
00:49:53,065 --> 00:49:56,585
这就是大多数人对英国汽车工厂的印象
This is most people's idea of a British car factory.

777
00:49:57,825 --> 00:50:05,464
一座1970年代就已经关闭的，被人遗忘的废墟
A ruin that closed down after some long-forgotten strike in the 1970s.

778
00:50:05,465 --> 00:50:07,664
但事实证明，实际上
But it turns out that, actually,

779
00:50:07,665 --> 00:50:12,345
还有很多超出你想象的英国汽车工厂正在进行生产
there's rather more going on than you might think.

780
00:50:15,225 --> 00:50:17,744
如今，在英国的某些地方
Today, a new car rolls off a production line

781
00:50:17,745 --> 00:50:20,825
每隔20秒就有一辆新车下线
somewhere in Britain every 20 seconds.

782
00:50:22,705 --> 00:50:25,224
本田在史云顿建有工厂
Honda has a factory in Swindon,

783
00:50:25,225 --> 00:50:27,864
那里有2700名工人生产
where 2,700 people are employed

784
00:50:27,865 --> 00:50:30,145
思域，爵士，以及CRV等车型
to make the Civic,the Jazz, and the CRV.

785
00:50:32,945 --> 00:50:35,304
丰田在德比郡建有工厂
Toyota makes cars in Derbyshire.

786
00:50:35,305 --> 00:50:39,464
生产的汽车用于出口日本
Cars, which are then exported to Japan.

787
00:50:39,465 --> 00:50:41,664
接下来是日产的工厂
And then there's the Nissan plant

788
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:42,984
建在英国东北部
in the Northeast.

789
00:50:42,985 --> 00:50:45,464
去年，这座工厂生产的汽车数量
Last year,this one factory made more cars

790
00:50:45,465 --> 00:50:49,145
比全意大利汽车厂生产的汽车总量还要多
than the whole of the Italian motor industry put together.

791
00:50:54,265 --> 00:50:57,664
而这些，还不是我们制造的所有汽车
And it's not just whole cars we make, either.

792
00:50:57,665 --> 00:51:00,704
去年，福特在全球卖出的每三辆汽车中
Last year, one in three Fords sold globally

793
00:51:00,705 --> 00:51:05,825
就有一辆车的引擎出自威尔士或者艾塞克斯的工厂
had an engine made either in Wales or here in Essex.

794
00:51:10,705 --> 00:51:12,225
不是仅此而已
And there's more.

795
00:51:25,225 --> 00:51:29,304
接下来，我们来到了劳斯莱斯在苏塞克斯郡的工厂
And then, we arrive at the Rolls-Royce plant in Sussex,

796
00:51:29,305 --> 00:51:35,144
这里，是的，许多部件都是来自德国
where, yes, many of the components are shipped over from Germany.

797
00:51:35,145 --> 00:51:39,185
但是将它们组装起来的工作是在这里完成的
But the job of putting them all together is done here.

798
00:51:42,905 --> 00:51:46,104
因为英国是唯一一个能把这些座椅真皮面料
Because Britain is the only country that appreciates

799
00:51:46,105 --> 00:51:49,104
缝合的天衣无缝的国家
it's better to trim the seats with hide from bulls,

800
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:52,585
原因就在于牛在怀孕的时期皮质会产生妊娠纹
because cows get stretch marks when they're pregnant.

801
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:57,344
之后你还需要这些处理木料的技术工人
Then you have the people doing the wood.

802
00:51:57,345 --> 00:52:00,024
他们都被称作，大师
Grandmasters, they're called.

803
00:52:00,025 --> 00:52:07,945
在油漆车间，每辆车都要消耗掉45公斤的涂料
And the paint shop, where 45 kilos of paint is applied to each car.

804
00:52:09,865 --> 00:52:11,944
然后，是这个环节
And then, there's this chap.

805
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:13,744
他的工作就是画上这些优美的线条
It's his job to apply the coach lines

806
00:52:13,745 --> 00:52:17,384
完成最后对成品的装饰工作...
and embellishments to the finished product...

807
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:19,225
纯手工制作
by hand.

808
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:25,864
你在现代工厂里是找不到他的这些装备的
You won't find his equivalent in a Hyundai factory.

809
00:52:25,865 --> 00:52:30,584
他把他的工作当成是一种休闲活动
He learned his trade as a pub sign writer.

810
00:52:30,585 --> 00:52:34,585
据说他有一双全世界最稳的手
It's said he has the steadiest hand in the world.

811
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:41,925
然后，就要说到汽车赛事
Then, there's motor racing.

812
00:52:42,385 --> 00:52:46,624
全世界，总共只有11支一级方程式车队
In the whole world,there are 11 Formula 1 teams.

813
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,104
8支的总部在英国
Eight are based in Britain

814
00:52:48,105 --> 00:52:53,144
而其中7支车队的总部在我现在站在的这座位于牛津郡的山头上就能被看见
and seven can be seen from the top of this one hill in Oxfordshire.

815
00:52:53,145 --> 00:52:56,384
那里，是威廉姆斯的总部
Over there, you have Williams.

816
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:59,584
那里是考斯沃斯的总部，那里是莲花和卡特汉姆车队总部
Up there in the Cotswolds,there's Lotus and Caterham.

817
00:52:59,585 --> 00:53:01,564
接下去，再往更远的地方
Then, moving further along,

818
00:53:01,565 --> 00:53:02,744
是印度力量和马鲁西亚的车队总部
we have Force India, Marussia,

819
00:53:02,745 --> 00:53:06,925
还有红牛车队和奔驰车队
Red Bull and Mercedes.

820
00:53:08,505 --> 00:53:12,585
英国对于汽车运动的贡献是非凡的
Britain's contribution to motorsport is extraordinary.

821
00:53:15,185 --> 00:53:17,504
所有的印地赛车
All IndyCar races,

822
00:53:17,505 --> 00:53:20,544
自从2009年以来的每辆达喀尔赛车
every Dakar winner since 2009,

823
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:24,784
今年勒芒LMP1组全部56辆赛车中的35辆赛车
35 of the 56 starters at this year's Le Mans,

824
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,224
包括冠军车队
including the car that won it.

825
00:53:27,225 --> 00:53:30,745
还有马鲁西亚F1车队，帕加尼风神
The Marussia Formula 1 car,and the Pagani Huayra.

826
00:53:32,945 --> 00:53:36,344
所有这些车的变速箱都来自于这座
All of them have gearboxes made in that factory

827
00:53:36,345 --> 00:53:39,105
位于伯克郡工业区的小工厂
on this little industrial estate in Berkshire.

828
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:45,224
全球75%的汽车工业革新技术和升级
A whopping 75% of all research and development

829
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:48,985
都是在英国完成的
done in global motorsport is British.

830
00:53:52,785 --> 00:53:54,025
英国制造的离合器
British clutch.

831
00:53:55,185 --> 00:53:58,304
英国的制造的混合动力系统
British hybrid system.

832
00:53:58,305 --> 00:54:00,265
英国制造的电控单元
British ECUs.

833
00:54:04,585 --> 00:54:07,944
不只是我们自吹自擂，“噢，你看！我们是不是很聪明？”
And it's not just us saying,"Ooh, look! Aren't we clever?"

834
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:11,064
全世界都喜欢我们生产的产品
The rest of the world likes what we're doing these days.

835
00:54:11,065 --> 00:54:13,424
在过去的7年里有超过5次
For five out of the last seven years,

836
00:54:13,425 --> 00:54:16,665
阿斯顿马丁被评为“全球最酷的汽车品牌”
Aston Martin has been voted "coolest brand in the world".

837
00:54:17,665 --> 00:54:21,905
并且，路虎揽胜也获得了一长串的全球获奖名单
And then, there's the list of global celebrities who drive a Range Rover.

838
00:54:30,905 --> 00:54:34,945
现在把眼光从轿车领域转向重型机械
Time now to move away from the cars and into the heavy engineering.

839
00:54:37,025 --> 00:54:40,744
从这张世界地图上看，所有红色区域的国家都使用
On this map of the world,all the countries shaded in red

840
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:44,224
英国制造的军用装甲车
use military vehicles made in Britain.

841
00:54:44,225 --> 00:54:47,024
所有绿色区域的国家
All the countries shaded green

842
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:50,264
都使用英国制造的卡车运输货物
use British-made lorries to move stuff around.

843
00:54:50,265 --> 00:54:52,904
所有黄色区域的国家
In all the countries shaded yellow,

844
00:54:52,905 --> 00:54:57,185
都至少有一辆JCB工程机械用来建造建筑物
there's at least one JCB helping to build something.

845
00:54:58,185 --> 00:55:00,984
虽然接下来这一幅地图和重型机械没啥关系
And while it's not exactly heavy engineering,

846
00:55:00,985 --> 00:55:05,865
所有褐色区域的国家都收看英国制作的汽车节目
all the countries shaded brown watch British-made motoring shows.

847
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:12,384
既然认清了我们英国确实也制造了很多伟大的车辆
Having established we do make quite a lot of stuff in Britain,

848
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:15,984
于是我们决定统计一下英国究竟制造了多少
we decided to find out just how much.

849
00:55:15,985 --> 00:55:18,744
因此我们发起了一个雄心勃勃的计划
So we hatched an ambitious plan.

850
00:55:18,745 --> 00:55:21,424
我们向所有车辆制造商发出了邀请
We called all the companies that make motorised vehicles

851
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:24,904
并向他们询问“能把你们生产的车辆
and said to them, "Could you bring whatever it is you make

852
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,624
开到伦敦来做个展示吗？”
"to a gathering in London?"

853
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:28,944
这其中摩根遇到一点小麻烦
A little bit of a problem with Morgan,

854
00:55:28,945 --> 00:55:31,184
因为他们不知道伦敦是什么地方
who didn't know what London was,

855
00:55:31,185 --> 00:55:34,865
但最终，每家工厂都给出了积极的响应
but eventually,everybody responded magnificently.

856
00:56:06,425 --> 00:56:09,744
杰瑞米，理查德，和我挑选了三辆不同型号的
Jeremy, Richard, and I are taking three different versions

857
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:11,304
F-Type前往伦敦
of the new F-Type to London.

858
00:56:11,305 --> 00:56:13,104
例如，我挑选了一辆V6车型...
I, for example, have the V6...

859
00:56:13,105 --> 00:56:16,105
哇噢！那些是凯旋摩托车
Whoa! That's the Triumph bikes.

860
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:19,025
真不错！
Tremendous!

861
00:56:34,145 --> 00:56:36,265
与此同时，在遥远的乡村...
Meanwhile,deep in the countryside...

862
00:56:40,665 --> 00:56:42,784
噢，瞧瞧那边！
Oh, look at that!

863
00:56:42,785 --> 00:56:45,184
现在，看看谁来了！
And now, look what's coming!

864
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:47,665
是摩根家族。加油，伙计们！
It's the Morgans. Carry on, chaps!

865
00:57:02,465 --> 00:57:04,064
比其他人更晚一些
Much later than everyone else,

866
00:57:04,065 --> 00:57:07,025
F1赛车们也启程前往伦敦
the Formula 1 cars began to leave for London.

867
00:57:14,385 --> 00:57:17,265
在米尔顿凯恩斯（F1车队总部聚集区，银石赛道所在地），这景象真是蔚为壮观
Which, in Milton Keynes,was quite a sight.

868
00:57:20,865 --> 00:57:22,945
雄壮的声浪
And quite a sound.

869
00:57:55,785 --> 00:57:59,344
最终，前往伦敦的车队们
Eventually, the fleet of vehicles that had been made in Britain

870
00:57:59,345 --> 00:58:02,265
开始向首都的目的地汇聚
began to arrive on the streets of the capital.

871
00:58:10,065 --> 00:58:12,305
在跑得最慢的伙计们找到了地点之后...
And after the slowest had turned up...

872
00:58:14,865 --> 00:58:16,384
我们坐进捷豹车
we climbed into our Jags

873
00:58:16,385 --> 00:58:18,784
前往集合地点
and headed for the meeting point

874
00:58:18,785 --> 00:58:21,785
去看看究竟聚集了多少车
to see how much stuff was there.

875
00:58:24,545 --> 00:58:27,025
这感觉真的很特别，干这件事
This feels a bit special, this does.

876
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:32,024
当我们驶过白金汉宫
And it became even more special

877
00:58:32,025 --> 00:58:34,184
以及林荫大道时
as we swung past Buckingham Palace

878
00:58:34,185 --> 00:58:35,905
这感觉变得更加特殊
and onto The Mall.

879
00:58:40,185 --> 00:58:42,305
这比我想象的还要多
There's more than I thought.

880
00:58:57,905 --> 00:59:02,584
林荫大道这些年举办过很多庆典
The Mall has hosted many uplifting scenes over the years.

881
00:59:02,585 --> 00:59:07,184
但是这里从没举办过这样的聚会
But it has never hosted anything quite like this before.

882
00:59:07,185 --> 00:59:11,384
让我们惊叹不已的不仅是这壮观的场面
It wasn't just the sheer volume that took our breath away.

883
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:14,425
更是这些种类繁多的差异性，这种宽宏的气势
It was the diversity, the breadth.

884
00:59:16,785 --> 00:59:20,784
轿车，卡车，挖掘机，赛车
Cars, lorries, diggers, racers,

885
00:59:20,785 --> 00:59:23,344
冰淇凌车，灵车
ice cream vans, hearses.

886
00:59:23,345 --> 00:59:25,704
真是太壮观了
It was magnificent.

887
00:59:25,705 --> 00:59:27,585
真是大手笔
It was huge.

888
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:36,024
我都不知道我们制造了这些自卸卡车
I didn't know we made those massive tipper trucks.

889
00:59:36,025 --> 00:59:37,344
看看那车！
Look at that that thing!

890
00:59:37,345 --> 00:59:40,384
拖拉机
A tractor.

891
00:59:40,385 --> 00:59:41,585
完全没想到
I didn't think of that.

892
00:59:44,745 --> 00:59:47,025
陆地最快纪录车！
Land speed record cars!

893
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,865
那是我测评过的巴士！看见了吗，伙计们？
There's my bus! All right, mate?

894
00:59:57,545 --> 00:59:58,585
哦嚯，捷豹鹰E型！
Ooh, the Eagle!

895
01:00:15,705 --> 01:00:17,044
如今很多人这么说
A lot of people say that, today,

896
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:22,344
英国不过是一个世界银行，或者一个精品商店，或者一个已经没落的昔日霸主
Britain is nothing more than a bank,or a boutique, or a busted flush,

897
01:00:22,345 --> 01:00:27,905
但是看看我身后停着的这些令人惊叹的展示车...
but looking at that staggering collection back there...

898
01:00:28,945 --> 01:00:30,825
我对他们的言论表示怀疑。
I'm not sure they're right.

899
01:00:32,051 --> 01:00:33,595
晚安
Good night.

900
01:00:39,999 --> 01:01:17,995
