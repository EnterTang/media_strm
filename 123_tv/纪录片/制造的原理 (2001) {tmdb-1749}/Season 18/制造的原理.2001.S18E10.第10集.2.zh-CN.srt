2
00:00:03,757 --> 00:00:09,588
Hi there and welcome

3
00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:13,361
to week two of

4
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:18,849
Nanotechnology:

5
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:24,440
The Basics.
My name is Dan Mittleman.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,860
And I'm going to be delivering a series of

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,210
lectures this week on nanoelectronics,
which is the intersection

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,370
of Nanotechnology with the electronics
industry.

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,720
By electronics, what I'm referring to are,
the electronic

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,370
components that are inside many of your
consumer devices today.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,730
They make your TV run, they make

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,390
your cellphone run, they make your
computer run.

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,690
All of those components that have
obviously gotten better and

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,270
more powerful and smaller as the years
have gone by.

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,700
Which is why our computers become obsolete
every three

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,860
years and we have to buy a new one.

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,850
What we will talk about in this lecture is
the trend of how that's happened and why

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,650
that's happened and a little bit about
what we

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,560
might expect will come next, so let's get
started.

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,980
To put things in context, we can take a
look

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,180
at the, these images here, which show a
cellphone and a

22
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,910
computer from about 30 years ago and they
were obviously

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,360
much less functional and also much larger
than they are today.

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,850
Nowadays, we understand that electronic

25
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,690
components have begotten a lot smaller and
a lot faster and a lot more powerful.

26
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,620
In your cell phone, if you have a
smartphone, then the phone in

27
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,360
your pocket has more computing power than
the entire world had in 1950.

28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,630
That's a fairly extraordinary advance in
really, just about one lifetime.

29
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,220
So, to understand what's going on here,
let's first

30
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,550
look inside a cell phone and see what we
see.

31
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,930
What we find is that there are a number of
electronics circuits

32
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,290
components, these little black boxes that
I'm circling

33
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,430
here are electronic circuits and you can't
see them.

34
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,620
They're packaged inside of thermal
packaging

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,740
and inside there you have Semiconductors.

36
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,150
The semiconductor in this case is silicon,
silicon is

37
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,330
the material that makes all of these
devices work.

38
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,760
Silicon can be formed into transistors and
diodes and other components and these

39
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,760
need to be all connected by wires and we
can make little logic circuits.

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,720
And the smaller you can make the
transistors

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,400
and the wires, the more of them you can

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
pack into a certain space and therefore,
the more

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,630
computing power you can get in a certain
space.

44
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,200
Those these electronic devices are inside

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,120
everything you use these days,
practically.

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,000
Their shrinking size has been,what has
revolutionized has

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,400
brought us what we call now the
communications industry.

48
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,210
The context that we can use to understand
this is a

49
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,230
paradigm known as Moore's law, which is
not really a law,

50
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,950
there's no law of science or nature that
says this has to happen.

51
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,430
But Gordan Moore, which was one of the
founders

52
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,570
of the company Intel noticed in the mid
70's,

53
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,300
that the number of transistors that one
can put

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,070
on a single chip, was doubling
approximately every two years.

55
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,650
And he observed that if this trend were to
continue, we would very rapidly

56
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,580
reach a regime, where we had so many
computers on a chip that the computing

57
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,240
power on a single chip, would be

58
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,390
extraordinary, by the standards of the
day.

59
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,650
Well, he was absolutely right, as this
graph shows you, here's the first,

60
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,910
this is the 286 computer, here is the 486,
here is the first pentium

61
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,650
right there and so on it goes, all the way
up to, this

62
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,630
graph ends in 2008, but it has continued
since then, even up until today.

63
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,960
So, the number of transistors on a chip
doubles every 2 years and

64
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,880
therefore, the computing power scales
exponentially with time.

65
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,560
And this trend is why computers are so
powerful, so

66
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,280
much more so than they were even just five
years ago.

67
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,550
There have been many occasions on which
prognosticators, including Gordon

68
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,380
Moore himself, have predicted the end of
this law have

69
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,070
said, no, it can't go on forever, it's
going to

70
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,820
stop in a certain year and yet it hasn't,
it continues.

71
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,360
I think it's safe to say that it will end
eventually,

72
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,190
but there's a lot of discussion about when
that will happen and

73
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,720
that's an interesting question, which

74
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,860
really will be answered by
Nano-technologists.

75
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,230
Because, as we will see, the devices that
are being built, at in the modern times,

76
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,620
ever since about here, are all devices
that are

77
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,350
based, that have nano- technology in them
the materials are nano sized.

78
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,020
So here's another version of Moore's law
and it

79
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,960
turns out there are many versions of
Moore's law.

80
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,220
This one

81
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,450
doesn't show the number of transistors on
a chip, versus here.

82
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,020
This one shows the size of those
transistors, the feature size, as

83
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,700
a function of year and this is also is
honoured exponentially favorable trend.

84
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,990
In other words they gets smaller and
smaller as time goes

85
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,220
on the doubling, the having time may not
be two years.

86
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,310
In this case it's actually a little faster
but

87
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,980
you can see that there is a an exponential
scaling.

88
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,740
And about the year 2001 we passed the
point at which transistor

89
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,400
sizes be, where, now below 100
nano-meters, this data point here, this

90
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,780
data point here is 35 nano-meters, that
was in about 2009 or 2010.

91
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,620
Right now, in 2013, we're down here where

92
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,280
the size is about 22 nano-meters and it's
a

93
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,350
very interesting question to ask, what
happens when we

94
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,360
try to extrapolate this line and predict
the future?

95
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,180
Another version of Moore's law is the cost
of a transistor, transistors get cheaper

96
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,550
as you make them smaller.

97
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,680
And so here, we see another exponential
scaling and nowadays, the cost of

98
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,930
a transistor is point oh, oh, oh, lots of
zeros one dollar per transistor.

99
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,420
There are lots of zeros in there

100
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,330
and that's why we can afford personal
computers.

101
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,800
So, really, almost anything associated
with

102
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,580
computation or the semi-conductor industry
is on

103
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,350
some sort of exponential trend and has
been for several decades and that's really

104
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,660
what has driven that industry forward.

105
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,510
That industry has taken to using Moore's
law as a method for predicting, for making

106
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,030
market forecasts and so the fact that
things

107
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,400
continue to fall along the Moore's law
line.

108
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,980
Is not really surprising, it's, it's been
predicted and it's what they're

109
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,040
aiming for, so it's not surprising that
they get what they're aiming for.

110
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,550
There are also some unfavourable versions
of Moore's

111
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,560
Law, for example, here's a plot of the
power

112
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,790
density on an integrated circuit, as a
function of year

113
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,610
and this is actually a predicting that was
made in

114
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,270
2001, by a vice president at Intel and he
predicted

115
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,630
that if power scaling continued around the
Moore's Law trend.

116
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,610
That very quickly we would get to a point,
where the

117
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,710
power density inside the chips was as hot
as the surface

118
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,950
of the sun and of course this would be
bad, because

119
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:26,270
then the chip would melt Prediction has
not come true, because of

120
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,040
multi core processors, the transition from

121
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,370
single core processors, to multi core
processors.

122
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,670
And also because of the development of
clever

123
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,450
ways, to do power management inside these
chips.

124
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,950
But it is true that the power scaling is
going up and

125
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,328
so eventually that becomes an issue that
one has to deal with.

126
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:44,260
Here's another unfavourable version of
Moore's

127
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,550
law this shows the cost of building

128
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,600
a factory where you can manufacture
integrated circuits as a function of time.

129
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,590
And that also goes up exponentially these
days, if Intel or one of those companies,

130
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,150
wants to build a factory to, to

131
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,350
fabricate chips, that costs them several
billion dollars.

132
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,060
And if you extrapolate this forward, you
can see that what you get

133
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,680
in 2025, you get a ridiculous number, so
that's clearly not going to happen.

134
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280
They're not going to be spending $1
trillion to

135
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,330
build a factory, so clearly, something has
to change.

136
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,240
These forward extrapolations are actually
in some sense very important drivers

137
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,230
for Nanotechnology research.

138
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,700
Here's the plot I showed you earlier, the
same one which shows

139
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,060
the feature size and if we try to
extrapolate that forward well,

140
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,620
very interesting things happen, we very
quickly get to a regime where

141
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,150
we can say; that conventional computing

142
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,330
architectures simply aren't going to work
any-more.

143
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:40,180
So here's 100 nano meters where we were in
the early parts of the 2000's, 2002 or so.

144
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,950
And at that point, the distance across

145
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,780
a transistor was about 100 nano meters,
which corresponds to about

146
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,790
350 atoms and the silicone still behaves
like silicone at that point.

147
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,930
in a few years we will be at the point
where the distance to

148
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,550
cross the transistor is only ten
nano-meters

149
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,200
and that's only 35 atoms and then

150
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,770
you become to wonder: does, if a chunk of
silicone that's only 35 across

151
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,680
still behaves the same as a chunk of
silicone that has lots of atoms.

152
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,950
And you get down to one nano-meter, now
you can be pretty sure that

153
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,080
the silicone is not going to behave the
way bulk silicon behaves.

154
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,840
And so at the very least, we know we're
going to

155
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,130
have to completely change the system
architectures in order to adapt

156
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,410
to the fact that the material is no longer
behaving the

157
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,250
way it used to, when we had a large chunk
of it.

158
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,880
That's putting aside the questions of, can
we

159
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,560
even fabricate things that are one
nanometer in size?

160
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,050
Which is a whole different challenge, that
is really an open

161
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,420
question at this point one nano meter
probably is too small.

162
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:33,600
What

163
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,000
I've told you today, really kind of
immediately illustrates

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,460
some of the grand challenges facing the
semi conductor industry.

165
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,800
Number one, they have to figure out how to

166
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,350
make these things, these features;
transistors and other components.

167
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,640
And they have to make them small and
smaller and smaller

168
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,240
and smaller as time goes on and eventually
that becomes really hard.

169
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,210
Well, it's already really hard, eventually
it becomes impossible

170
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,850
and you have to be able to do it
economically.

171
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,600
number two, we haven't talked yet about
the wires,

172
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,200
you can't just have a bunch of transistors
on

173
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,670
a chip, you have to connect them together
with wires.

174
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,380
And in the past and today, that's just
done with copper wire but

175
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,590
eventually, when your wires get small, do
they continue to behave like wires?

176
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,680
That's an important question to ask and
actually they don't.

177
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,450
So then you have to worry about that and I
mentioned

178
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,560
a little bit this issue of the heat
generated inside these materials.

179
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,710
Thermal management is a huge issue facing
this

180
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,830
industry and they, that may be the game
changer

181
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,360
in the end, the thing that just stops them

182
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,100
from using silicon and forces them to use
something different.

183
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,700
So, is Nanotechnology the answer to these
grand

184
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,280
challenges well, I think Nanotechnology
clearly plays a role.

185
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,860
The question of whether it's going to be
the answer and what the answer

186
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,040
in detail is going to look like, that's
still very much an open question.

187
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,470
So to wrap up here and remind you of what
we just

188
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,320
said, the key ideas are number one,
electronics get smaller and faster and

189
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,650
better, as time goes on.

190
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:56,150
Smaller is what enables better and faster
and that's a prediction of

191
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,150
Moore's Law, which is not really a law,
but it has been true

192
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,890
for a very long time and it will continue
to be true

193
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,570
for at least another decade or so, people
argue about exactly how long.

194
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,220
But at some point it is going to stop
being true at some point, it will no

195
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,690
longer be possible to stay on that
forecast

196
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,120
and so then the question is, what comes
next?

197
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,450
If you'd like

198
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,170
to find out, then stick around for the
rest

199
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,060
of the lectures this week and we'll talk
about it.
