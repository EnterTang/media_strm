1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:30,002
 

2
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:57,790
 

3
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:15,621
 Over 2000 years ago, ancient Chinese scholars observed the changing patterns in our natural world climates, the turning of the seasons and astronomy. The scholars measured and divided the sun's annual movement 

4
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:30,622
 into 24 equal parts, creating the Twenty-four Solar Terms which was used to govern agriculture in ancient China. Even to this day, this invention still guides the lives and traditions of hundreds of millions of Chinese. 

5
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:45,623
 Every year around February fourth the Chinese people welcomed the first solar term: the Beginning of Spring, wearing silk flags in their hairs and tying carrots with red cords to the trees. All the villages

6
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:58,010
 celebrate the very first night of spring together. 

7
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:15,141
 Hello, my name is Dominic. I'm originally from the UK but I came travelling to China almost 25 years ago, and I've stayed here ever since. 

8
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:30,142
 In 2016, something called "China's 24 Solar Terms" was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage of humanity.

9
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:45,143
 Now, as I mentioned before, I've been in China a long time but I'd never heard of the Solar Terms. what are the Solar terms? And what significance do they have in today's China?

10
00:02:45,142 --> 00:03:00,144
 2000 years ago it was a simpler time; (it) would be eons before science reproduce modern technological comforts that we enjoy today, but despite the simplicity, the Chinese of ancient times

11
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:15,145
 were highly observant, especially when it came to astronomical atmospheric phenomena. Taking into account the changes in the shadows cast by the sun throughout the year, along with the length of the days and nights, 

12
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:30,146
 they charted and divided the annual motion of the sun into 24 equal segments. Each segment is one Solar Term and the full cycle of 24 Solar Terms repeats itself year in and year out. Once this cycle was conceived,

13
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:45,147
 the ancient Chinese were allowed to clearly plan a year in advance, especially when it came to agriculture. Is there any use for the solar terms today? Are the 24 Solar terms still the concept

14
00:03:45,146 --> 00:04:00,148
 that are being passed down to other generations? With these questions in mind, I impart a journey into the unknown. 

15
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:15,149
 Shi Qian is the first destination of my missions to understand the solar terms. Located in the mountainous and undulating landscape of southwest China's Guizhou province,

16
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:22,550
 Shi Qian has numerous waterways that wind their way through its rugged mountain landscape. 

17
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:37,721
 Twelve ethnic minorities number among the 460,000 people who've called this place home. The area's unique traditional culture and its road system, don't make it the easiest place for tourists, but they certainly contribute

18
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:52,722
 to an authentic in comparable ambience. In my experience, any attempt to quickly grasp the city's history,

19
00:04:52,721 --> 00:05:07,723
 culture and customs should start with a visit to a local museum. I arrived at Shi Qian museum, hoping to find traces on the twenty fourth Solar Terms. There are countless

20
00:05:07,722 --> 00:05:22,724
 examples of traditional crafts, art and folk culture on display at the Shi Qian museum, but as younger generations increasingly seek their fortunes farther afield, many of these traditions may be fated to exist only in a museum. 

21
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:28,070
 One particular folk culture tradition, however is luckily still being practiced today. 

22
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,350
 Shuo Chun (Telling Spring).

23
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:46,241
 Shi Qian country 2017 Ceremony of Announcing Spring, an intangible cultural heritage of humanity, starts now. Li Chun,

24
00:05:46,240 --> 00:06:01,242
 or the beginning of Spring, as it's known, is the first of the twenty-four Solar Terms. It marks the starting point on the wheel of the four seasons when the world is all revived. 

25
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:15,050
 In Shi Qian every year on Li Chun, the ancient custom of Spring Announcer begins. 

26
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:30,601
 In April the summer begins and until Grain Full Day, every family is busy with ploughing. The people who have played a central role in the gathering and its associated

27
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:45,602
 ceremonies are known as the Spring Announcers. They are the ambassadors of spring. In the past, farmers counted on string announcers to announce the arrival of spring 

28
00:06:45,601 --> 00:07:00,603
 and the beginning of spring ploughing.

29
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:15,604
 Feng Wanming is admired in his county. He continues to carry the torch of his ancestors as the fourth-generation Spring Announcer.

30
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:30,690
 The history of our spring announcers

31
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:41,770
 is to advise local people to carry out farming tasks every month. They are told specifically which job to do each month.

32
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:54,150
 It can be dated back to Tang Dynasty whose emperoro Li Siming waged a war here. After winning and returning to the capital, this emperor asked us which title our people would like to claim. Our ancestors picked this one: Telling Spring Officer.

33
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:09,361
 Telling Spring Officer is Spring Announcer.Feng is at his busiest each year on the ten days before and after Li Chun.

34
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:18,430
 At this time, he walks the streets and goes from house to house to announce the arrival of spring in order to ensure everybody knows that it's time to start ploughing. 

35
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:33,530
 But announcing the beginning of spring isn't that simple. Essential tools and cultural artifacts like spring calendars, seals and carved spring oxen need to be prepared in advance. 

36
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:45,350
 Spring calendars are carved onto wooden blocks and contain the twenty-four Solar Terms and applicable farming information for each term. 

37
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,850
 Spring cattle is sculpted from wooden blocks.

38
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,410
 Is this an ox?

39
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:04,870
 Did you carve it? Yes, I did. Very nice. (It's) for ploughing. We wouldn't survive without it.

40
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:18,290
 Do you bring this sculpture along when announcing spring? That's right. Mr. Feng has run a publishing house here. Are you printing spring calendars? Yeah.

41
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,570
 In spring calendars, you know about four seasons,

42
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,010
 like which month is longer and which one shorter. There are 24 solar terms,

43
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,290
 and you know which month is the time for seeding, planting

44
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,810
 or weeding. Each month is meaningful.

45
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,150
 That's the way.

46
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,130
 Right.

47
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,990
 Turn it over and put it there. Oh, it's the most beautiful calendar ever.

48
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,050
 How's it done? OK. Good.

49
00:09:45,440 --> 00:10:00,541
 The Spring Teller was an occupation authorized by the emperor in ancient China. A hat and gown signifying their rank was their uniform, representing their status and level of knowledge. 

50
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:15,542
 I'm the first foreign spring teller. You're terrific!

51
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:30,543
 Everything is ready, but before setting out Feng pays his respects to heaven, earth and his ancestors. He seeks the blessing of his work and looks to empower his chanting to benefit farmers. 

52
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:45,544
 Good wind and fine rain.

53
00:10:45,543 --> 00:11:00,545
 The Chinese use joyful colors in farming ceremonies, showing their respect and appreciation of nature. Oxen have helped Chinese farmers for nearly 3,000 years. With this in mind, the Chinese. 

54
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:15,546
 also have a custom in which they show respect to cattle. One of the activities associated with spring chanting is for the spring announcer to stir the paper-made cattle, using colored wooden sticks.

55
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:22,870
 This is meant to rouse the cattle from their subdued winter states and encourage the farmers to prepare for spring ploughing. 

56
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:38,061
 On the second strike, an abundant harvest of all crops. On the third strike, a prosperous country and peaceful life. All return to the original places.

57
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:56,141
 Look at that. Now is the time!

58
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:11,142
 Wow, after the ceremony, the real cattle are also warmed up. The strongest cattle in the county begin to set out on their first foray into the fields under the command of the most experienced farmer,

59
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:26,143
 signaling the start of a new year and working on the land. Spring ploughing is a top priority for farmers. My task now

60
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:39,150
 is to follow Feng from door to door to announce the beginning of spring. 

61
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,930
 Every year at the beginning of spring,

62
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,050
 Feng Wanming traverses the mountainside and visit all the villages around Shi Qian.

63
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,010
 He will typically greet more than thirty families every day. 

64
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,850
 A more appropriate name for this practice should be spring singing

65
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:05,330
 as the words are actually sung out loud rather than chanted.

66
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:17,950
 (Singing)

67
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:29,610
 (Singing) I printed this calendar. May you be happy and prosperous.

68
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,370
 (Singing)

69
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:54,201
 Showing at the right time is essential for reaping a good harvest. The essence of a spring teller's lyrics are the 24 Solar terms. These include the terms for

70
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,910
 wedding,

71
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:03,650
 the term for sowing and the terms for harvesting. Feng know those intricate solar term lyrics by heart. 

72
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,990
 (Chinese)

73
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,230
 (Chinese) Flourish in populationa and pass on in generation.

74
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:27,181
 The lyrics are not written in stone, and he occasionally add lives to his lyrics and wings it with improvised blessings tailored to different situations and conditions for every different family. Feng spreads cheer to all

75
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,110
 that welcome him. 

76
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:38,010
 Nobody wants to miss out on a blessing to kick off the year (Chanting)

77
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,470
 Have a drink and you'll be rich.

78
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,050
 (Singing)

79
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,530
 (Singing)

80
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:10,461
 There is a strice timeframe for chanting spring. Ten days after Li Chun,

81
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:25,462
 the practice is over for that year. Feng then goes home and rest for a while, rewarded with tribute money. 

82
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:38,290
 Brand new? It's spacious! Three stories? Do all the family members live here? How many of you? Six!

83
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,270
 Take a seat. Wow, the look of a new house. It's great.

84
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:55,850
 When did you move in? Five years ago. Who is this handsome man in the photos? My grandson and granddaughter-in-law. Are they newlywed? Yes.

85
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:09,370
 How much can you earn in a year? Me? Now I can't make much money. Every year he makes a lot of money in announcing the spring. See? He's telling the truth. Before the spring telling there are ten days and after that another ten days. Totalling as 20 days, I make 200 yuan every day. So 2,000 yuan.

86
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,510
 Who paid you? The host family. We go to one family or another, and the owner would pay us, such as your family.

87
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,350
 He pays you. How much would it be if a family pays you the highest amount?

88
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:30,430
 As much as more than 100 yuan. Chanting spring provides a good source of income for the spring announers. These payoffs encourage spring announcers to pass on this tradition.

89
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:45,861
 The Chinese believe that spring is a key time of year, and whether or not the year will be a success depends on a good start in spring. Solar terms to Chinese farmers are about more than simply timing; they are a representation

90
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,270
 of natural cultural heritage. 

91
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,910
 When farmers start their spring ploughing, Feng's job is done. 

92
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,910
 He stores the tools and props in his old house on the mountainside.

93
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,490
 Chanting spring, when did you start it?

94
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,130
 Since I was about 5 or 6 years old,

95
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,010
 Our parents have been teaching us.

96
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,170
 Most of the time the lyrics would be taught to boys rather than girls.

97
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,630
 (music)

98
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:29,970
 I love the old houses like yours.

99
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,350
 Right. I built it myself.

100
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,530
 I assembled them myself.

101
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,030
 When did you build it? 55 years ago?

102
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:45,890
 55 years ago? I was 18 years old then. Are you a carpenter, too? Yes. Did you make a living as a carpenter?

103
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,450
 Yes. Totally depended on that. 5 yuan a day.

104
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,630
 5 yuan a day? Aye.

105
00:17:53,100 --> 00:18:08,201
 I earned 5 yuan a day. How about this job now? Now I would make 200 a day with great ease. Right now as a spring announcer, you would be quite busy around Li Chun period. Right. You would sing. That's true.

106
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:18,270
 I love this poster. When did you buy it? It was bought decades ago. Decades ago? How beautiful it is!

107
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:33,361
 I, a foreigner, just love this. What about this? It's a coir raincoat. Farming in the field, you would wear it on your back on rainy days to keep the rain off. Now there're raincoats, but back then we wore this.

108
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,290
 This is an antique which I shouldn't throw away. But you shouldn't throw your house away. Your house is still here. I have sons and grandsons.

109
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,850
 But if they don't want the house, it's their business.

110
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:55,021
 Since most young people from this countryside are moving to big cities to seek their fortunes these days, a lot of these old traditions

111
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,470
 are not being carried on. 

112
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:13,681
 To help pass this tradition on, the local government here has set up a spring chanting class as Shi Qian's primary school. Feng tells me that every year

113
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:28,682
 two graduates will join the spring telling team to pass on the tradition and knowledge of chanting spring and the 24 Solar Terms.

114
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:43,683
 I believe the reason why this tradition has been carried on for thousands of years is Shi Qian's people's age-old dependence on the land and their deep respect for nature. Their understanding

115
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:56,590
 of nature and the Solar Terms continues to help nourish the tranquil countryside and industrious farmers of Shi Qian.
