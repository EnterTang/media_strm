1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,560
This programme contains
strong language and scenes
of a sexual nature.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,640
I found these keys last time
I was here. Are they yours?
Never seen them before.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,160
And who's Alma Carter?
Is she my mother?

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,120
Alma Carter's not interested.
She didn't want you.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,600
Who's that then?

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
It's Hayley, the fit intern.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,400
She's been flirting with me non stop.
Hayley?

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,040
Tell her to take the day
off tomorrow, right? And ring me.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,120
I had to fire her. You
recommended her. She's your protege.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,440
I'm Tess, Chloe's ex.
Who the hell are you? Shona.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,640
Were you seeing her
before you finished with me?

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,840
Is there anything 
I need to worry about?

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,840
You... you and Frankie,
you go back a long way...

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,600
She's a friend, that's all.

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,040
Is there someone? Anyone?

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,520
Cat... It's always been Cat.

17
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh, my god!

18
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,080
Oh! Oh, god!

19
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,280
Morning.

20
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,960
I think I love you...

21
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,760
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,240
No...

23
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,160
I like it.

24
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,080
Do you just like it, hm?

25
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,240
Or...

26
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,120
I need to go to work.

27
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,720
I feel your heat, but cannot touch.

28
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,560
A lonely moon orbiting the sun.

29
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,280
The gravity between us,

30
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,440
The only thing stopping me
from falling back to earth...

31
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,040
Audition script? Sorry.

32
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,880
I wish. No, it's Ed's book.

33
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,560
Well, first draft. It's really good.

34
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,560
You sound surprised. Well,
I'm not, but I mean, really good,

35
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
like a proper book you'd
pay money for and everything.

36
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,480
It's about these two scientists
working on a space station...

37
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,280
and he really loves her
but he can't do anything
about it because she might

38
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,520
be from this race of aliens they're
researching and he might be a robot.

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,200
It's brilliant. Brilliant...

40
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,520
So, um...

41
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,040
did you and Jay stay up
long after I crashed?

42
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,880
Not really.

43
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,680
Cos I got up in the middle of
the night to get a drink and...

44
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,240
You saw. I couldn't help it.

45
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,560
Yeah, well, it was nothing.
It was Jay! He's a man! He's...

46
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,440
he's got, like, bits. It's just like
a strap-on without the strap.

47
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,000
Aagh! What...

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,960
but what about Becky?
How's she going to find out?

49
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,200
Well, I won't tell her. Neither
am I, and I doubt Jay's going to
be shouting it from the rooftops.

50
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,160
We were drunk, it felt like a
good idea at the time. All right.

51
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,360
As long as you're not
going all hasbian on me.

52
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,320
Becky throw you out early
or something? No, no.

53
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,280
I didn't stay there last night.
Thanks.

54
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,840
Everything all right? Uh-hum.

55
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,960
I just thought you two were
in training for domestic bliss.

56
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,720
When did you know?
That you loved her?

57
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,600
Why you asking me that?
When does anyone know?

58
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,280
You're a keeper, you tell me.

59
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,160
Morning.

60
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,080
How's the hangover?

61
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,040
All right, yeah. I think I...

62
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,840
got away with it. I just got to go...
photocopy these things.

63
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,560
I didn't expect you in today.

64
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,560
You walked in on them?
No, the door was open.
They're actually having an affair?

65
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,800
No! Apparently it was
just a one night thing.

66
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,680
Has Frankie always been...

67
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,640
Well, she's always been out with
girls but I know she's fucked

68
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,720
a couple of guys here and there.
Is that...

69
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,360
I mean, have you ever?

70
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,440
And Jay? Jay'd probably
fuck you if you had tits.

71
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,160
What is this?

72
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,880
Early birthday present.

73
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,080
Argh, you remembered.

74
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,760
But you're not allowed to open it.
I'm going to open it!

75
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,000
Ah!

76
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
Ah, that's so sweet!

77
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,040
Thank you.

78
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,960
It's you and me, Mykonos '08! Yeah.

79
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,640
Look at your pasty little chest.

80
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,240
So what we doing for it?

81
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,360
Er, there's not much to celebrate.

82
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,000
It's your 30th!

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,080
Exactly.

84
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,720
By now I was supposed to be
guesting onstage having already
built up a Hollywood fan base.

85
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,600
Instead it's like I'm in some
shit version of Groundhog Day.

86
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,720
It's not that bad.

87
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,120
Well. So we're what, successful?

88
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
There's no point dressing it up.

89
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,520
But what am I doing about it?
What are you doing about it?

90
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
You've got this great book...
Did you read it? Yeah.

91
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,600
And? It's brilliant.

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,560
But instead of getting it out
there you're here drinking tea.

93
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,440
Where's the drive,
the bloody-minded determination to
push your life to the next level?

94
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,360
I've sent it off.

95
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,400
Oh!

96
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,760
Well done. Just to some agents.

97
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,200
I was going to ask if yours had
a literary division, actually.

98
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,920
No. I don't think so. Um...

99
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,160
I mean, I could ask?
I was going to pop in today actually,

100
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
big push and all that...

101
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,520
Hey. Hey.

102
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,760
I'm sorry about last night,
the police and everything.
It's no excuse...

103
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,720
I saw my Uncle after you gave me
Alma's details. And what'd he say?

104
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,760
That she didn't want me.

105
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,480
So she is your mother?

106
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
Yeah.

107
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,920
What now? I don't know. It's not
like I've got any way of finding
her even if she wanted to be found.

108
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,320
Well, if you do get another
lead, try leaving me a message
instead of going nuclear.

109
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,640
Yeah, speak to you later. Well...

110
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,920
nice to see you two
getting on again.

111
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,720
The site is an old school
but the developers are doing an
appraisal to turn it into flats.

112
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,760
They've asked us for our input.
No way...

113
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,200
Don't worry,
the orphans have all been rehoused.

114
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,080
No. This is where we went.

115
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,320
You were schoolgirls together?
Yeah, uniforms and everything.

116
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,400
We were a couple of years apart.

117
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,040
I wouldn't mind going back.
I could take some pictures.

118
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,760
The brochure's almost done.
You just need to
choose the photos that you want.

119
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,680
I'll do the school as
part of the same fee.

120
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,440
That's really not necessary...

121
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,840
No, hang on!
Anything that improves the pitch...

122
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,480
Unless you think your
personal feelings could
cloud your judgement again.

123
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,240
They won't. Right. Perfect.

124
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,960
I'll expect something on my desk
when I get back from Germany then.

125
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,880
What's his problem?

126
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,040
Doesn't matter.

127
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
I had it in my head that
I wanted a fry up.

128
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,560
So I went to this all-night cafe,
fell asleep, and by the time
I woke up it was time to come in...

129
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,120
Really? Here, I'll phone the
estate agents right now. No, you
won't, cos we're not doing it.

130
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,000
Becks?

131
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,800
I want you.

132
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,840
All this stuff can wait
till we're both ready, OK?

133
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,280
But don't think going AWOL's
the way to get round me...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

134
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,680
I love you, OK?

135
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,320
I want what you want. I promise.

136
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,560
I'll see you later. Bye.

137
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,920
See you.

138
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,200
Hey. What are you doing?

139
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,800
Nicotine?

140
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,880
Right. Jay!

141
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,800
It was only a fuck.
Listen. It was a fucking mistake.

142
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,640
Yeah, well, it was both of us.
I didn't have to twist your dick.

143
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,320
I just want to forget about this, OK?

144
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,640
I already have. Hello!

145
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,840
Hey.
Hands up if your head hurts today.

146
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,120
Yeah. What you doing here?

147
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,840
I wanted to talk
about Tess' birthday.

148
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,120
Is my sister around?

149
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,360
I could get a new haircut.

150
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,840
Like a pixie bob, accentuate my
cheekbones, fringe over the wrinkles?

151
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,840
It isn't as if I haven't been
trying for you, Tess, but...

152
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,120
I know. You have seen most of the
casting directors in Scotland.

153
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,040
And?

154
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,960
And the feedback I get is...

155
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,480
you have a tendency to...

156
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,080
What?

157
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,520
Too physical? I don't project enough?

158
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,480
Be a little negative.

159
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,320
What? You did cry at audition.

160
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,800
Once!
Then there was the balcony incident
at the Shakespeare workshop.

161
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,040
Romeo had a hard-on!

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,040
So what do I do, Saphia?

163
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,760
Cheer up.

164
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,680
You're an actress...

165
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,000
contort your face into a smile
and be happy!

Hello?

00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,080
Er, yes,
I'm just finishing with a client...

169
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,160
Oh, Tess...smile. OK!

170
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,680
She said she didn't want a fuss.
She always says that.

171
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,080
But I think that's what
she needs after Lou.

172
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,160
Yeah, well, you are the Tess expert.
What are you thinking? Surprise...

173
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,600
The Dykes of Hazard.

174
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,720
Friday night at Gravity.

175
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,680
Country and western.

176
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,040
Tess does love it. It's got
Kenny Rogered, Billy Gay Cyrus...

177
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,360
Playing to a bunch of
hen nights in stetsons...

178
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,680
Yeah, and how are we going to get
her down there without her realising?
Why not do it at my flat?

179
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,080
It's not like we
haven't got the space.

180
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,120
As long as it doesn't
get too messy again.

181
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,200
Messy how?

182
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,400
The...flat warming last night...

183
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,960
Tess puked. I passed out.

184
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,760
You'd have hated it.

185
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,360
What do you think I am? That
sounds exactly what you'd want
from a party! Yeah, exactly.

186
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,160
Tess has been going
on about the local.

187
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,920
I could take her down there while
you guys set up. Or I could?

188
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,480
I mean, I already talked to
her about doing something...

189
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,720
so if you guys say you're busy, if
she does try to make other plans,

190
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,040
then she'll have no other option.
Fine.

191
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,080
You all right?

192
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
Yeah, it's just...

193
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,600
Hayley. I feel like
if I'd looked out for her a bit more
she might still be in a job.

194
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,480
She's a big girl, Cat.

195
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,360
Someone gave her the ketamine.
She didn't say who?

196
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,160
She wouldn't tell me. She thinks
I'm like a teacher or something.

197
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,000
You always were a bit
of a girl scout. Thanks.

198
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,080
No, in a good way!

199
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,920
How's it good?

200
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,760
You think about stuff,

201
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,360
you don't just dive in.

202
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,120
Maybe a bit too much sometimes.

203
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,400
But...at least it means
you make good decisions.

204
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,040
You do the right thing.

205
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,400
I wish I was a bit more
like that sometimes.

Jesus, I remember it
being even bigger than this.

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,720
I think we were just smaller.
Well, I was.

209
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,120
I remember you being
pretty well developed.

210
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,480
I think you should
get some pictures.

211
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,920
Oh, God...

212
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,040
So you remember?

213
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,400
Course I remember.

214
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,600
Every break time, you were
up there writing 'lyrics'.

215
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,160
Only cos I knew your
registration room was down there.

216
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,160
I used to get this great
view down your shirt.

217
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,680
We used to wear skirts too remember?

218
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,760
Worked both ways.

219
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,440
I can't believe they're still here.

220
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,240
You were watching way
too much Cell Block H.

221
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,960
I was trying to impress you!

222
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,120
It was my first time in detention.

223
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,360
I thought it's what you did!

224
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,040
You were in here more than you were
in class, you should've stopped me
if it was so lame. It wasn't lame...

225
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,400
I quite like having our
names up there together.

226
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,040
You thought you were so cool.

227
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,520
What was it? "What you in for?
Mine's the usual, smoking."

228
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,960
It was better than yours!
What was it? Flashing the
PE teacher or something?

229
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,720
I was campaigning for girls
to be able to wear shorts.

230
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,680
It was a political protest!

231
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,400
Mum went mental when she found out.

232
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,240
Marching in accusing the
school of quashing free speech.
It was so embarrassing.

233
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,400
Well, that was one thing I
never had to worry about.

234

Whatever happened with your mum...
we don't know the circumstances.

235
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,000
She was young... She's not any more.

236
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,960
Give us a drag then.

237
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,640
You've given up!
Just for old times' sake.

taking up dick again, is it?

supposed to cough your lungs up.

Dib, dib, dib.

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,040
No! No evidence!
No evidence! Get your hand out!

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,520

He's going to go ballistic
when he gets back from Germany.

252
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,480
They say it's mostly
just smoke damage.

It's not funny.

255
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,240
I'm not exactly employee of the
month after all this intern shit.

256
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah. That wasn't your fault.

257
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,840
Everything's my fault since he
found out I like girls as opposed
to middle-aged fat men in suits...

258
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,680
Two months ago he was talking about
making me partner, now he's looking
to demote me and I give him this.

259
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,640
Yeah, it wasn't your fault, Cat.

260
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,440
It was Jay.
Jay gave Hayley the gear.

261
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:44,640
I helped him cover it up at
the time but I didn't realise
it would put you in the shit.

262
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,000
What...
what was he even doing with her?

263
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
I don't think anything happened.

264
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,120
Only because she passed out!

265
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,360
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
I just didn't want to grass him up.

266
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,120
I'm not blaming you.

267
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,520
Bloody Jay!

268
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,600
So I get this call, and it's this
specialist sci-fi agency asking if I
'do lunch'!? That was quick.

269
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,160
It was the main guy as well.
The company's named after him!

270
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,640
Amazing...

271
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,000
I wonder if he'll have picked up
on the same flaws I did. Flaws?

272
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,520
Yeah.

273
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,120
Like, it's brilliant and everything
but the main guy, whatsisname? Sorin.

274
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,360
Yeah. Why doesn't he just
like, go for it with her?

275
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,200
Well, that's kind-of the point.

276
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,640
He can't...her species forbids it.

277
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,480
Well, he should.
Like, it's better than floating round
space wondering what might have been.

278
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,960
But would she...reciprocate?

279
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,240
Well, you're the writer.
Make it happen.

280
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,040
Right, I make it shots o'clock.

281
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,560
Actually I'm going to leave it.

282
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,080
I want to have a clear head tomorrow
for this meeting.

283
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,080
But it's Wednesday! We always
do shots o'clock on a Wednesday.

284
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,960
Well, I'm having shots o'clock.

285
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,680
Oh, and I was thinking I probably
should do something for my birthday.

286
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,400
Why the change of heart?

287
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,800
Oh, it's my meeting...
Oh, yeah? It went well?

288
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,760
Yeah.

289
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,360
Yeah, it turns out, um... she still
thought I was doing the runner's job,

290
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,240
and now there's like a whole
backlog of auditions. Awesome!

291
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,000
So I was thinking we could
check out your new local?

292
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,360
Hm, I wonder if it
should be something bigger.

293
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,400
Like, really celebrate. I'll speak to
the others and see what they think.

294
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,760
Course, yeah. Go for it.

295
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,880
Thanks for all your help.

296
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,000
Like we never left. Listen, don't
worry about Alistair. It'll be fine.

297
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,160
Uh. Looks like you've got company.

298
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,880
I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah.

299
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,640
Hey. Clarice let you
off with a caution then?

300
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,320
Yeah. Couldn't get you on the phone.

301
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,080
Just wanted to make sure you
were all right after yesterday?

302
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,320
Yeah, I'm fine. Busy day.

303
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,200
I didn't even make it into work.

304
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,320
I can barely remember anything
that happened last night.

305
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,000
It's probably for the best.

306
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:11,080
You coming up? Yeah? I was only
planning an early night but you
can come up for an hour or so.

307
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,840
I think I'll leave you to it.
Maybe another time.

308
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,520
All right.

309
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,400
Whatever you think.

310
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,600
Night.

311
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,200
Honey, I'm home!

312
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,640
Hey.

313
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,280
You smell of smoke...
Oh, I had a meeting on site.

314
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,520
You know what builders are like...

315
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,720
That smells amazing!

316
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,680
You know, when I was
younger I used to have this
fantasy about Bewitched.

317
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,800
The girl band?
No, I had that one too.

318
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,560
No, I mean the old TV show.

319
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:03,440
Where the witch marries a
human and then she turns
into the perfect '50s housewife?

320
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,360
Are you seriously telling me
that this does it for you?

321
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,640
Uh-hum. Each to their own.

322
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,000
DOOR OPENS

323
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,560
You're not fucking anyone are you?

324
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,560
No. Come in...

325
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,000
You all right? Yeah, fine.

326
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,160
I was just wondering, are you
doing anything on Friday night?

327
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,440
I was thinking of doing
something for my birthday.

328
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,560
Shit. Sorry, I said I'd work. Ah! I
can try and get out of it, though.

329
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,480
No, no, no, it's OK!

330
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,720
I wasn't going to do anything big.

331
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,760
Sure? Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

332
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
Happy, happy!

333
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,680
So I bumped into Ed earlier...

334
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,040
What,
signing books in Waterstones, was he?

335
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,240
It seems he knows
about me and Jay...

336
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,040
Ah!

337
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,960
You didn't seem that
bothered earlier...

338
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,680
It's fine. But you got to tell
him it can't go any further.

339
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,560
OK. It could really mess
things up for Jay and Becky.

340
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,640
No, I'm serious.

341
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,280
All right. Cool.

342
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,160
I didn't know you'd
taken up boxing...

343
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,080
What? FG Boxing.

344
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,920
I auditioned for a self defence
radio ad but apparently
I don't even sound fit.

345
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,160
I didn't hear a fucking bell!

346
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,760
Get back to work!

347
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,240
Can I help? This place just
for boys or can anyone join in?

348
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,200
We do girls too... some of them
are uglier than the boys though.

349
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,720
So how'd you hear about us?

350
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,800
My flatmate has these.

351
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,040
They work here? I don't know.

352
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,840
This is a staff keyring.

353
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,040
I can't believe you stood there
letting me take the flak while

354
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,400
you're the one doling out ketamine
in the first place. I'm sorry.

355
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,440
What about Becky? What about her?
I thought you were leaving all
that snatch-hound shit behind...

356
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,760
I was! I am! Then what were you
doing in the toilets with Hayley?
Listen, you can talk!

357
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,680
Back to school with Frankie,
strolling down memory
lane behind Sam's back.

358
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,120
I was working! Would Sam see it
like that? I am happy with Sam!

359
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,640
I'd never go back!

360
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,440
She gave you head,
made you breakfast and went to work.

361
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,960
What's the problem?

362
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,760
I just...

363
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,600
I don't want to scare her off.

364
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,320
I...she's been a bit distant.
Do you think it's the ex?

365
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
I just think you're being paranoid.

366
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,560
Yeah? You like this one, right?

367
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,640
A lot.

368
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,160
I didn't need to tell her though. I
tell women I love them all the time.

369
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,520
Yeah, that's when you're
trying to fuck them.

370
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,760
What if they said it to you?

371
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,120
Mm.

372
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,160
Saying I love you's like
a gun fight.

373
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,440
If you draw first,
you'd better not miss.

374
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,160
Girls' group classes are
Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays.

375
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,880
You should check it out,

376
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,400
they'll love you.

377
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,520
All right? Yeah, sorry. Could you...

378
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,120
could you get me a glass of water?
Yeah, no problem. Back in a bit.

379

PHONE RINGS

380
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,400
Hello? Hi, Catflaps, it's me.

381
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,000
Erm,
what are you doing on Friday night?

382
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,920
Me and Sam have got gig tickets. Ah.

383
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,320
Why's that?

384
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,640
Erm, er, it's nothing.
Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

385
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,920
It's just I haven't seen you much
since I moved out, but another time.

386
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,560
How's Sam? Yeah...good. Good.

387
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,360
You two must be loving
it without me there.

388
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,320
Sex in the bath, sex on the sofa,
rubbish in the bin.

389
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,560
Yeah, she's, er...
really making herself at home.
Don't sound too enthusiastic!

390
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,240
No, no, I am. I am. It's just...

391
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,080
you don't want to hear about all
this happy-clappy couply stuff.

392
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,840
Why not?

393
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,720
I don't know. Just...

394
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,880
How's the new place working out?
Yeah, good...

395
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,600
Great view.

396
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,960
Frankie not keeping you up
all night with Sadie? Not really.

397
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,880
No? Why you asking? No reason.

398
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,520
So, look, I'm sorry again about
Friday. I'll make it up to you, OK?

399
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,760
Oh, no, no. It's...
it's OK. Look, I'll, um...

400
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,640
I'll speak to you later. Yeah, bye.

401
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,640
Hi!

402
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,040
Erm, I just...
I've just moved in next door.

403
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,680
Um, haven't we met before?

404
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,760
Maybe. Um, well, this is going
to sound really weird but, um...

405
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,080
I was wondering if, um...do, er...

406
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,920
Er, if...do you know any
decent electricians in the area?

407
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,640
Um, my lights have just gone out...

408
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,880
TV, radio, everything!

409
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,520
You're in luck.

410
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,880
I'm a spark.

411
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,480
Right, um...

412
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,360
Um,
you really don't have to do this...

413
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,040
I don't mind.

414
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,800
That's weird. Um...

415
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,160
this was all not working
a minute ago. Er...

It's probably just your breaker.

418
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,240
Right... It's a little box?

419
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,800
Usually up high, or built into your
fittings. Do you mind if I just...

420
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,400
No, no, go ahead.
And I'll just, um...

421
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,960
Is it a little box, did you say? Mm.

422
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,360

Yeah, yeah...thanks.

00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,960
Hello?

426
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,280
Yeah, yeah, can I ask who's calling?

427
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,400
Chloe? Um...oh, it's just...

428
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,240
it's my ex... Ex...

429
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,000
flatmate. Girlfriend.

430
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,080
Thanks. I can go...

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,360
No, no, no...no! Um...

00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:28,400
yeah, this really isn't a good time,
er, my neighbour, um, I just...

433
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,560
Your breaker's fine by the way.
Er, um...

434
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:36,000
no, no, no. Wait! You, erm...

435
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,520
oh, no!

What do you want?

437
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,720
It's the same guy I met with Jay.

438
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,360
His name's Darren Morris,
I recognise his picture.

439
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,720
If he's lying about the keyring,
he could be connected to my past.

440
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,960
Are you going to go back?

441
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,320
Be careful.

442
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,240
So, this one?

443
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,880
Mm, do you think Tess'll
be able to work the buttons?

444
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,080
It's the future.

445
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,000
Don't tell me you're
still using Milo?

446
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,400
What's wrong with Milo? It rattled!

447
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,640
I'm surprised you could hear
it over your sound effects?!

448
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,000
Um, do you reckon they giftwrap?

Thanks.

Alistair's landed.

453
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,640
Well, she sounded kind-of nervous

454
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,440
but she said she wanted to meet up in
person to tell me something big.

455
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,600
You don't think she wants to get
back together, do you?

456
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,240
Dunno.

457
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,120
But you wouldn't, would you? No.

458
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:41,160
Not after everything she
put you through? God, no!
I'd tell her to piss right off.

459
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,440
Um, but the way, you didn't say
anything to anyone about the
Jay and Frankie thing, did you?

460
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,560
No. Good. Cos you mustn't.

What do you think I am?

Well, Frankie said you
almost let it slip...

463
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,360
I shouldn't have even told you!

464
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,840
She's unbelievable. Thinking she can
just make up the rules. What rules?

465
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,760
Well, what is she?
Is she les? Bi? Straight?

466
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,360
Well, isn't that a bit out of date?

467
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,240
Yeah, but it matters! Does it?

468
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,960
Doesn't it? I mean, they do say
sexuality's more of a fluid thing.

469
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,440
Well, I don't really want
to think about the fluids.

470
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,480
No, but less
black and white, more of a spectrum.

471
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,800
Well, I guess
we are all just people...

472
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
bodies and stuff.

473
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,920
Exactly!

474
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,040
So, technically
anyone can love anyone?

475
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,960
Yeah, I guess.

476
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,120
It was an accident.

477
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,440
But it's not the first one
you've had this month, is it?

478
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,640
I don't know what's
distracting you...

479
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,360
But if your mind's not on the job
then I'll have to seriously

480
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,560
reconsider your position
within this company.

481
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,320
I'm so sorry. It was my fault!
Cat was outside.

482
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,040
She had nothing to do with it.
Frankie... Look, it was stupid.

483
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,240
But if Cat took responsibility for
every stupid thing I'd done
she'd be sectioned.

484
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,880
Maybe that's what the issue is here.
Responsibility.

485
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,560
If she can't look after a
photographer, let alone an intern.

486
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,600
Well, that was me as well. What?

487
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,520
I gave Hayley the ketamine.

488
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,960
Right. Get out!

489
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,600
Yeah, my pleasure.

490
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,720
How much of this did you know about?

491
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,720
I did warn you about her.

492
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,120
Sorry... Dildo.

493
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,480
What the?

494
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,240
# Don't leave the house today

495
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,320
# I've got the fear

496
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,720
# You'll be stolen by bandits

497
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,840
# And taken far from here

498
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,640
# They'll put you in a cage

499
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,240
# Made of skeleton bones

500
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,200
# I get a ransom call

501
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,480
# On my telephone, uh-oh

502
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,200
# We don't have that kind of money

503
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,560
# We don't have that kind of bread. #

504
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,680
Ah! Thanks for coming. It's fine.

505
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,760
You're looking...good.

506
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,360
It's BOTOX. BOTOX?

507
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,000
We're not going to stay
looking young forever.
You should think about it.

508
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,600
Happy Birthday, Tess.

509
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,840
So...

510
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,560
that isn't
what you wanted to see me for?

511
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,280
Sorry. No, no, it's OK.

512
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,000
I'd rather forget about it too.

513
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,800
So, what did you want?

514
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,640
Well...

515
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,920
we did go out for quite
a long time, didn't we?

516
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,360
Yeah. And that's got to
count for something...

517
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,440
no matter what
happened towards the end.

518
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
I suppose...

519
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,760
I'm not looking for your approval
or permission or anything,

520
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,440
but you're still a significant
person in my life...

521
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,280
You remember Shona from Spanish?

522
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,600
Yeah... We're getting married.

523
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,040
Aargh!

524
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,200
I know you were never keen on the
whole civil partnership thing but I
felt you had the right to know.

525
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,200
You were never that keen on
monogamy with me! You've...

526
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
you've only been with her six months!

527
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,240
It's eight months.

528
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,200
You're just bitter because
I'm moving on with my life.

529
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,680
What? Settling down with
the bride of Frankenstein?

530
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,920
Off to the sperm bank
with your turkey baster?

531
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,480
I should've known you can't
be happy for me. Yeah.

532
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,960
You can't be happy for anyone
cos you're miserable and negative

533
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,000
and think it's funny you're a loser.
That's why I dumped you.

534
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,520
But at least I respected you enough
to want to speak to you in person.
Clearly I was wrong.

535
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,480
Clearly you were. Bye, Tess.

536
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,720
Have a nice life.
Yeah, send me some cake.

537
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,000
PHONE RINGS

538
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,680
Happy Birthday! Woop woop!

539
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,600
Guess what, I've got an agent!

540
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,080
Even bought me lunch.
With champagne. Lots of champagne.

541
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,400
I'll tell you about it in the pub.
Don't be late.

542
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,960
So...
talk me through these new changes.

543
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,920
The astronaut bangs the alien, right?

544
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,240
Well, it's more of a
happy ending really...

545
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,920
# I said I don't know... #

546
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,760
Yes, you bloody will!

547
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,440
Listen to me!

548
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,360
Yes, you bloody will!

549
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,080
DOOR OPENS

550
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,360
Look, she's...
This is going to come back on you.

551
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,920
Back on you big time!

552
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,000
I recognise his car.

553
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,720
You didn't knock after that?

554
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,280
If those two know each other then
fuck knows what I'm walking into.

555
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,720
Do you want me to see if Sam
can look up this Darren Morris?

556
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,680
No.

557
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,480
God, it's no wonder
I'm such a fuck up.

558
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,160
You're not a fuck up.

559
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,880
I am.

560
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,680
OK, you are, but...

561
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,760
But what?

562
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,280
Tell me...

563
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,320
You know, you're the only one
who's ever really known me.

564
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,520
I should go. Sam's coming
to mine before the party.

565
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,280
Yeah.

566
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,800
Course she is.

567
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,640
I'll see you there then.

568
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,640
Where am I going to get a cowboy
outfit at this type of notice?

569
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,800
Pigtails, blusher.

570
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,640
Sexy Pocahontas.

571
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,360
Is this a party or a role play?

572
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,880
Bit of both...

573
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,800
I didn't think you wanted
to know after the other day.

574
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,400
I've been having family problems.

575
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,120
Who hasn't?

576
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,600
So, are you coming then?

577
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,000
Tell me you want me there.

578
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,560
I want you there.

579
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,760
You were supposed to be here 20
minutes ago, we're going to be late.

580
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,520
I missed you too.

581
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,800
Where've you been?

582
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,520
I got ambushed by my landlady.
It looks like I'm going to have
to find somewhere else to live.

583
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,080
Are you all right?
I didn't say anything.

584
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,040
You didn't have to.

585
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,560
I'm fine.

586
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:25,600
You've just been a little bit off
with me over the last couple of days,
that's all.

587
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,360
Sorry.

588
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,720
I've just had a really busy week.

589
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,760
It's my best friend's surprise
party, I don't want to be late. Yeah.

590
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,920
Ye-ha!

591
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,560
Lady Luck must be a dyke.
I love this place!

592
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,000
What can I say? I'm a rent girl.

593
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I could probably help you find
somewhere bigger than Jay's if you
want...mates rates, no strings.

594
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,600
BUZZER RINGS
Oh, that might be Tess.

595
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,920
How does she know
what your place looks like?

596
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,480
I don't know.

597
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,440
Hey, cowgirl. Hey, cowboy.

598
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,560
Sheriff... All right?

599
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,080
Nice place.
Yeah, shame about the freeloaders.

600
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,840
Drink? Thanks.

601
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,760
I'll sort this out.

602
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,520
OK.

603
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,040
Is she the one
that stole my necklace?

604
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,840
What? Sadie. She gave it back.

605
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:43,280
Well, if you want Sadie,
at least act like it.
Cat's taken. Get over it.

606
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,400
You told her what I said to you?

607
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,160
I didn't have to. Listen,
don't try too hard, all right?

608
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,840
Cat told me she's more than happy
with Sam and that's that.

609
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,560
I'm sorry.

610
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,560
Wait, wait... What?

611
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,600
I'm just going to see where
the birthday girl is. Yep.

612
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,880
# Without you I'm just not myself

613
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,920
I was here on time but
there's no sign of her...

614
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,360
No...

615
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,400
Oh, hold on...

616
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,680
Tess!

617
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,840
Who are you supposed to be?
Jackie Onassis on an ASBO?

618
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,440
What happened to you?

619
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,280
BOTOX. It was a birthday treat.
But I had a reaction.

620
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,680
It doesn't look that bad.

621
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,280
I'm not going out.
Come on, it's your birthday.

622
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,920
There's nothing to celebrate! Tess!

623
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,680
Chloe's getting married!

624
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,160
At least it wasn't to tell you
she had Chlamydia.

625
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,880
Hey! Whoa, Tess... What?
Good riddance to her.

626
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,240
Yeah, but why does she have to ride
off into the sunset while I
accelerate into a lonely grave?

627
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,440
Hey, you've got loads of friends.
Yeah, but not tonight though, eh?

628
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,080
All too busy...

629
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,480
That's not true. Yes, it is.

630
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,440
I'm sorry. Hey.

631
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,120
Sorry.
I can't even fucking cry properly.

632
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,240
Arrgh. Ssh.

633
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,640
Who cares about Chloe?

634
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,520
Everything else is great.
You've got loads of auditions.

635
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,680
No, I haven't.

636
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,160
I lied. But I couldn't tell you
because you were doing so well.

637
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,040
Tess...

638
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,040
I got your message. Congratulations.

639
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,680
I don't care about that.

640
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,960
You don't have to lie to me.

641
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,720
I was jealous!

642
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:37,160
And scared that if you were a
success, you wouldn't want to hang
out with a loser like me any more.

643
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,160
Tess, you're not a loser!

644
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,440
OK?

645
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,920
Tess, you're amazing.

646
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,680
You're beautiful,
you're kind, you're talented.

647
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,680
And you don't even realise how funny
you are, by accident and on purpose,

648
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,240
and if the rest of the world can't
see that then they're idiots.

649
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,120
But I can.

650
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,120
And I'll never leave you.

651
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,000
Because I love you. Ah.

652
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,800
I love you too, Ed.

653
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,320
No. I LOVE you.

654
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,400
Like...

655
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,280
like a man loves a woman.

656
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,600
Tess?

657
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,280
Tess! Tess, you said se...

658
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,480
you said sexuality was fluid.

659
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,760
Fuck!

660
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,920
BUTTONS BEEP

661
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,040
PHONE RINGS

662
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,600
Hello?

663
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,800
Frankie, she's coming...

664
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,880
Tess is coming!

665
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,400
No! No, don't let her in!

666
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,200
Quick! Someone get the music!

667
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,640
Sssh!

668
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,240
Surprise!

669
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,080
Tess?

670
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,320
Hey, what's up?

671
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,640
Hey?

672
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,120
Ssh...

673
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,400
Ed!

674
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,800
What happened? What did you do?
I told her. You told her what?

675
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,400
That I'm in love with her.

676
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,320
Are you?

677
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,080
No wonder you never pull!
Jay... You do realise she's gay?

678
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,160
Well, it didn't stop you
with Frankie, did it?

679
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,280
When?

680
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,920
Is that where you
were the other night?

681
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,600
No...

682
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,840
No!

683
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,080
KNOCK ON DOOR

684
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,880
Don't let anyone in.

685
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,640
Tess? Go away!

686
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,440
I'm sorry. What?
We can still be friends.

687
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,520
I thought we were friends.
But all the time you were...

688
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,760
Just get out. Can both...

689
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,440
both of you just get out.

690
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,160
All right.

691
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,360
Come on.

692
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,040
Ow!

693
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,080
You fucking bitch.

694
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,000
Becks. Don't fucking Becks me.

695
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,600
Is it true?

696
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,160
Becky...

697
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,160
Becky!

698
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,800
We should go.

699
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,400
Canape?

700
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,480
Here...

701
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,440
Frankie, stop.

702
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,000
Come on.

703
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,160
Kiss me.

704
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,400
Frankie, stop.

705
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,480
What? Come on.

706
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,920
It isn't me you want. Is it?

707
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,840
It is tonight.

708
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,800
What?

709
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,720
I really liked you, Frankie.

710
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,000
See you around.

711
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,200
Don't go. Stop it.

712
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,040
I love you.

713
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,880
You could move in with me.

714
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,400
You...you're sure?

715
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,480
We, we...we never gave this a shot.
Who's fault was that?

716
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,240
Dig any deeper, you'll hurt
yourself. Try to find out,
I'll hurt her too.

717
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,000
Some actress has dropped out of
Uncle Vanya at The Tron and they
need to audition a new Sonia today.

718
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,640
Shit. You don't think
it's broken, do you?

719
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,800
Why do you want her?

720
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,240
We're just going to chat...

721
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,960
That's not what I meant.
