1
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:32,521
Tower, this is Masters,
we have no eyeshot.

2
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,897
-How is it going on the airport?
-I'm sorry,Major.

3
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,038
We've lit even
the back generators.

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,333
-You'll have to lmmerse.
-Immerse?

5
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,340
I can't see an inch from my face.

6
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,314
You stlll have
the equlpments, rlght?

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,513
Correct.
I'm 25 miIes west.

8
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,386
l suggest you to drop 7 thousand
feet, try and get an eyeshot.

9
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,217
Right away.

10
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,940
Let 's go, we can do it.

11
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:29,944
shit!

12
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,781
Tower, I was hit by a thunder.

13
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,300
Masters, what's golng on?

14
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,832
I've just Iost aII my equipments.

15
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:48,306
I'm Iosing stabiIity,
the inner pression is faIIing.

16
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,277
-Can you try to go back on track?
-Nothing is working!

17
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,784
Tower, I have probIems.
The equipments seem...

18
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,851
they're not gonna make it
tiII we Iand.

19
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:08,384
Tower, do you hear me?
I repeat. Tower, do you hear me?

20
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:21,538
Mayday, this is Masters,
at TDs-17.

21
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,542
I'm coming for a crash Ianding.

22
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,815
Come on.

23
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,249
Out of my way!

24
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:08,691
Keep working on the gauges, aII
right? I'II be right back. Thanks.

25
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,504
You get two months Ieave, Major,
and this is what you do with it?

26
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,872
-sir?
-Let 's take a waIk.

27
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,709
I've got an assignment for you.

28
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,214
Are you famiIiar
with Henderson Davis?

29
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,617
The third richest man
in the Northern hemisphere?

30
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,123
He's aIso one of the country's
Iargest miIitary contractors.

31
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,319
-so?
-His daughter RocheIIe...

32
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,929
just graduated from coIIege...

33
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,430
and he's throwing her
a IittIe birthday party.

34
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,965
Pardon me, sir...

35
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,797
but how does that reIate
to me going back up in the air?

36
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,532
WeII, you see, this party
begins about 3O,OOO feet up.

37
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,970
Permission to speak freeIy, sir?

38
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,167
Granted.

39
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,938
sir, you know I'm committed
to the miIitary.

40
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,878
But I need a reaI mission...

41
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,052
not some babysitting assignment.

42
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,187
Major, you are one good piIot.

43
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,620
UntiI the inquiry board cIears you,
this is the best you'II get.

44
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,772
Come on, Min, sIow down.
We've got pIenty of time.

45
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,102
You know me,
I aIways Iike to be on time.

46
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,369
Besides, it 's an important gig.

47
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,310
Come on, it 's a party for a
spoiIed IittIe rich girI.

48
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,280
Yeah, whose Daddy just
happens to own the airIines.

49
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,387
I know, I know. But I'm not gonna
kiss up on this trip.

50
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:40,490
And wiII you pIease sIow down?
You're starting to scare me.

51
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,856
Oh, shit.

52
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,823
What?

53
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,761
There's something wrong
with the brakes!

54
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,197
-Oh my God, weII pump them!
-I am, I am!

55
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,300
-Min, oh my God, puII over!
-I can't, I can't!

56
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,064
Oh my God!

57
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,169
Oh my God!

58
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,632
HeIIo.

59
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,195
No, I can't. I'm heading to
the airport right now.

60
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,133
No, it 's gonna be great.

61
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,932
Two weeks. Yeah.

62
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,310
Hey, Iisten, I'II caII you when I get
back and we'II go out. I promise.

63
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,605
Bye.

64
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,508
HeIIo?

65
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,441
Oh hi, Rick.

66
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,513
You're kidding me.

67
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,183
Today?

68
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,447
What time?

69
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:18,048
Yeah, I can make it.
Which airport?

70
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:22,383
Oh, thank God. I'II caII you
when I get back. Bye.

71
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,648
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

72
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,551
Most peopIe rareIy do.

73
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,662
Hey, is everybody ready?

74
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,603
Is everybody here?
AII right, Iet 's go. Come on.

75
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,656
WeII, this must be our man now.

76
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,202
You must be GeneraI McCIoren's man.

77
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,031
That wouId be me.
John Masters.

78
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,174
-Henderson Davis. Jimmy Watkins.
-PIeasure.

79
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,877
I assume you've been briefed
as to why you're here.

80
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,103
Routine security aboard your pIane.

81
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,874
shouId be an easy
job for a man of your abiIities.

82
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,881
Let me teII you: I didn't get where
I am without making enemies.

83
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,917
It 's an honor
and a priviIege to do it, sir.

84
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,090
If it 's Iike you said, then
I'm just a champagne chaperone...

85
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,451
aIong for the ride.

86
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,058
Yeah, weII,
don't you drink too much.

87
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,160
someone's got to be sober
in case these kids turn...

88
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,125
that pIane into an animaI house.

89
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,863
Don't worry, I brought my toga.

90
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,728
Funny. Very funny.

91
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,631
Just sit back, be invisibIe.
When you get to AustraIia...

92
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,808
escort everyone to the Barrier reef.

93
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,772
-You shouId enjoy this vacation.
-sounds great.

94
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,947
I'm with the caterers.
I'm Iooking for the Davis party.

95
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,309
-You found it.
-Where do you want us to set up?

96
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,384
straight through there
in the first-cIass cabin.

97
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:18,921
Gotcha. We'II go in through the
deIivery access on the tarmac.

98
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,796
Daddy!

99
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,491
Hey, here's my baby now.
Come on, I'II introduce you.

100
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,539
RocheIIe, sweetheart.

101
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,938
Thank you, thank you so much.
This is the best present ever.

102
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:43,672
Remember, you've worked hard for
this so it 's your time to enjoy it.

103
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,647
-Jerry? Roger!
-sr. D.

104
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,352
-GirIs?
-Hi sr. D.

105
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,486
Good evening.

106
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,659
Ladies.

107
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:09,064
Huh. I don't remember seeing
those guys on board before.

108
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,607
Oh, Davis must have hired
some new caterers.

109
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,711
-What 's the word on the storm?
-Nothing that wiII affect us.

110
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,678
Latest charts say it 's 6OO
miIes due south of Hawaii.

111
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,612
LittIe bit of rain,
but nothing to worry.

112
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:20,944
sounds good to me.

113
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,314
I got to say, Mr. Davis,
this is pretty cooI.

114
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,650
Yeah, scuba diving in the Great Barrier
Reef. Never though I'd get to do that.

115
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,794
Yeah, weII guys, just don't Iet my
daughter swim in the deep water?

116
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,089
Oh Dad, you know I'm certified.
Don't worry so much.

117
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,700
Yeah, weII don't put yourseIf in
any unnecessary situations.

118
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,894
Hey, don't sweat it, Mr. D.
I wiII keep my eye on everybody.

119
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,005
Oh, good, and who's gonna keep
an eye on you? Jerry?

120
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,505
No, that 's not your job, Roger.

121
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,645
That 's why I'm sending
Mr. Masters aIong for the ride.

122
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,107
Dad, pIease. I'm 22.

123
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,109
-I don't need a babysitter anymore.
-Come on, Roche, forget about it.

124
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,051
It 's just one other person to
party with us, and besides...

125
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,316
I think he's kind of cute.

126
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,187
You said that about
the Iimo driver too, MeIanie.

127
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,453
And?

128
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,494
Come on, Iet 's get on that pIane
before you invite...

129
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,529
the entire grounds crew, too.

130
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:12,703
-I was just commenting, is aII.
-Bye, Dad. I Iove you.

131
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,269
-Okay, caII me when you Iand.
-AbsoIuteIy.

132
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,738
-Have a good time.
-Bye, and thanks again.

133
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,275
Don't mention it.

134
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,776
Here.

135
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,539
I don't need your heIp.

136
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,379
Bye! Major, I won't forget this.

137
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,520
I probabIy won't, either.

138
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,019
sir.

139
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,088
Hey, here they come.

140
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,800
HeIIo. WeIcome.

141
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,501
WeIcome aboard.

142
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,533
Way to go, Roche?

143
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,807
Gonna miss the pIane.

144
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,115
AII right,
that shouId do it.

145
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,646
You ready?

146
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,053
-Oh. Here you go.
-I said I got it.

147
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,989
-Hey, I'm just trying to heIp.
-I don't need your heIp.

148
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,028
Listen, I just got this gig
5 minutes ago, okay?

149
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,860
Yeah, but you, or someone
Iike you has had this gig...

150
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,366
for the Iast 22 years of my Iife.

151
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,937
Do you know what 's it 's Iike never to
have a private moment, Mr. Masters?

152
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,701
-I can't say I do.
-ExactIy.

153
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,604
You want to heIp me?

154
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,040
sit in the back, don't interface.

155
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,813
Bye, Daddy! Bye!

156
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,487
Whatever you say.

157
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:41,155
Ouite a girI you've
raised there, Mr. Davis.

158
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,557
spitting image of her Mom.

159
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,462
sorry to hear that, sir.

160
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,402
-Hey guys!
-There she is.

161
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,538
-Hey, Roche.
-Hey, MeI.

162
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,215
This is the best.
Your Dad is so cooI.

163
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,646
I know.
But where's the champagne?

164
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,867
Davis 2 to tower. Can I get a
cIearance on runway 3?

165
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,401
WouId you Iike some wine?

166
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,012
-sorry.
-It 's okay.

167
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,822
Why don't you take a picture?
They Iast Ionger.

168
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,627
-What did I do?
-Come on, Jer. You're being obvious.

169
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,156
so? A guy can Iook.

170
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,462
Looking is one thing.
DrooIing is something eIse.

171
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,931
-so what 's your point?
-It 's Iike I keep teIIing you.

172
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,771
Got to be a IittIe smoother
than that. Okay?

173
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,986
so, your Dad bought out
the entire hoteI, right?

174
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,353
Every room.
The pIace is totaIIy ours for a week.

175
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,825
This is so cooI. You know,
this may go down in history.

176
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,123
As, Iike,
the greatest birthday ever.

177
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,559
Yeah it is. I can't wait.

178
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,896
so Iet 's hope those native
instructor boys are cut.

179
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:38,137
Can I perhaps offer you Iadies another
gIass of champagne before departure?

180
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,970
-CertainIy.
-I'd Iove some.

181
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,737
Me too.

182
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,212
Enjoy.
And happy birthday, Miss Davis.

183
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,419
Thanks.

184
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,727
Ladies and gentIemen,
this is Captain Craig.

185
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,661
My Co-Pllot today

We'd llke to welcome you aboard...

187
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,895
our non-stop fllght to
the Land Down Under.

188
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,369
Our flylng tlme thls evenlng
ls approxlmately 13 hours.

189
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,907
We have just one fllght ahead
of us on the runway,so...

190
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,045
please fasten your seatbelts,
we'll be underway shortly.

191
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,078
After we're airborne,
I've turned off the seatbeIt Iight...

192
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,841
feeI free to party.

193
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,351
AustraIia, baby! Whoo!

194
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,525
Fllght attendants,please
prepare fortakeoff.

195
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,214
-Ready for this?
-Yes.

196
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,431
Whew, man! It is wet out there!

197
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,175
-stiII raining out there, huh Mac?
-Oh, it 's coming down, sir.

198
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,469
The big stuff,
stiII 5 or 6 hours out.

199
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,738
Yeah, so much for the
storm staying south.

200
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,745
-What 's E.O. got to say?
-Northeast at 5O knots.

201
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,884
Category 2,
but stiII fiIIed with strength.

202
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,451
AII right break out the tarps,
gentIemen.

203
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,781
We got ourseIves a rain deIay.

204
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,251
You know, that may be so,
Lieutenant, but may I remind you...

205
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,055
that both I and the Us Army want
that runway finished in 5 days.

206
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,297
By sunday, sir, it 'II be finished.

207
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,732
5 days. It 's five 12-hour shifts.

208
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,839
4 days is 4 sixteen-hour shifts.
3 days is 3 twenty-hour shifts.

209
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,942
-You see where I'm going?
-I'm foIIowing you.

210
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,409
AII I see is that it 's wet outside.
so I'II see you Iater.

211
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,343
Everyone's a comedian.

212
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,851
Thls ls yourCaptaln.
I've turned off the seat belt slgn ...

213
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,853
so feel free to move
about the cabln.

214
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,985
I missed you back there!

215
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,096
Hlckham to Davls 2,
Hlckham to Davls 2,please come ln.

216
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,027
Hickham, this is Davis 2, come back.

217
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,035
Got a new update on the typhoon.

218
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:58,208
lt's changed course and comlng
Northward at 60 knots.

219
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,810
Suggest you lncrease your altitude
another 5,OOO feet...

220
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,742
to avold turbulence.

221
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,349
Roger, Hickham, I'm going to 38,OOO.

222
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,018
How's the weather at your end?

223
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,848
Torrentlal raln ln Honolulu.
And the other lslands.

224
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,583
Not the garden spot you
want to be tonlght.

225
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,260
Roger that, Hickham. stay dry.

226
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:17,860
Davis 2 out.

227
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,066
Miss?

228
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,300
-Wine?
-No, thanks.

229
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,670
-Try it.
-No, I'd Iike to have some cIub soda.

230
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,911
Come on, is that aII you got?
Wimpy throw, man.

231
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,779
Oh, you want it good?
Oh, you want it good?

232
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,454
Now how's a man supposed
to have a good time on cIub soda?

233
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm not being paid
to have a good time.

234
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,019
sorry...

235
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,762
sorry about that...

236
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,943
Excuse me. More champagne, Miss?

237
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,618
Mind if I sit out
the turbuIence for awhiIe?

238
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,586
As a matter of fact, I do.

239
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,799
Jennifer, what are you doing?

240
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,534
Making new friends.

241
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,965
Come on, get back to your seat.
You're drunk.

242
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:39,768
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Where is my seat again, anyway?

243
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,907
Right over there. Now go use it!

244
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,854
It 's gonna be a Iong fIight.

245
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,196
Nice fashion choice, Cobb.

246
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,371
I can't beIieve you've got a grizzIy
bear on your necktie.

247
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,802
I'm a cop, Guss, not a maIe modeI.

248
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,704
Hey, speaking of GrizzIies,
you shouId have seen a guy...

249
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,573
FaIIs off his baIcony and impaIes
himseIf on his own wrought iron fence.

250
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,508
Right up his poop shoot.

251
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,979
Does that give
you some strange fetish?

252
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,516
WeII, I had to cut his whoIe
Iarge intestine open.

253
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,712
BIood everywhere. Feces everywhere.
Looked Iike your underpants.

254
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:28,086
-I've been wearing a thong IateIy.
-Oh. WeII, don't turn me on.

255
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,454
so exactIy where
did we find these 2?

256
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,096
Down at the bottom of MuIhoIIand.
It 's a damn shame.

257
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,528
Looks Iike their car shot through
the guardraiI and went straight down.

258
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,565
skidmarks?
Uh, on the road?

259
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:41,067
About 1OO feet, intermittentIy.
We sent the rubber sampIes to the Iab.

260
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:41,932
How fast?

261
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,835
WeII, they weren't
observing the speed Iimit.

262
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,972
WeII, sometimes girIs
get bad breaks.

263
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,369
Come on, that 's funny.

264
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,605
It 's a doubIe entendre 'cause
she couIdn't stop the car.

265
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,306
Yeah, hiIarious.
Just a reaI tragedy, you know?

266
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,748
I've got a daughter just about
the same age as these 2.

267
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,421
Yeah, weII, nobody Iikes to see this.

268
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,191
-WeII, that 's interesting.
-What?

269
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,860
Looks Iike a bad day
for fIight attendants.

270
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,127
-What do you mean?
-WeII, it 's not just this one.

271
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,997
I got 2 more this afternoon in.

272
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,867
-Two more fIight attendants?
-One fried herseIf in a bathtub...

273
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,805
and the other feII off a train.
The 2 of them Iooked Iike accidents...

274
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:22,206
but we aImost opened investigations
into both of them.

275
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,474
WeII, that 's the first interesting
thing you've said aII day.

276
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,612
-sr. Gussman?
-sir?

277
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,051
What do you say we start that
investigation right now?

278
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,381
sure thing.

279
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:57,833
HeIIo? Anybody in there? Come on!

280
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,368
What now? Looking for peanuts,
I suppose.

281
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,870
No, just checking for the crew.

282
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,637
They seem to have disappeared.

283
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,975
Your charming personaIity,
no doubt.

284
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,617
-They probabIy jumped.
-You know, if I had a chute...

285
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:17,754
-I'd probabIy join them.
-I'II see if I can find you one.

286
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,146
Damn!

287
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,384
snap it up in there, wiII you?

288
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,530
You know, there is one in the rear.
UnIess you consider that sIumming.

289
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,121
You know...

290
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,893
with very IittIe heIp,
I can Iearn to despise you.

291
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,064
Is that so?

292
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,688
Remember, the rest of the
passengers are expendabIe, but...

293
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,724
no matter what, the girI stays
safe and unharmed.

294
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,258
It 's much harder to ransom a corpse.

295
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,921
-What about the chaperone?
-One of Davis's muscIe heads...

296
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,101
Don't sweat it,
I'II take care of him.

297
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,792
-Everyone ready?
-Yeah.

298
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:09,405
AII right, then.
Let 's go take ourseIves an airpIane.

299
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,078
-What?
-Nothing. Just checking for the crew.

300
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,686
ReaIIy? I thought perhaps
you might wanna...

301
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,759
step inside
and pouder my nose for me.

302
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,358
I suppose somebody on Daddy's
payroII has been doing that...

303
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,090
since you were born.

304
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,531
But thankfuIIy,
it 's not in my job description.

305
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,862
Go ahead, knock yourseIf out.

306
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:05,062
AIright chiIdren. sit stiII, shut up,
and nobody wiII get hurt.

307
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,196
Your host, where is she?

308
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,033
-I don't know.
-I said, where is she!?

309
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,204
You can't do that!

310
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,839
The heII I can't, boy.

311
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:30,580
You aII speak onIy when spoken to.
Understand?

312
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,052
CarI, Joseph, Gustav, she must be
in the rear somewhere...

313
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:36,694
with that security man.
Come. Ladies, watch them!

314
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,180
Miss Davis,
I suggest you get out now.

315
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,179
What? Are you crazy?

316
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,952
-Miss Davis. Right now.
-But I'm not done yet.

317
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,683
-Yes, you are. Come on. Come on.
-stop that!

318
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,692
Get down.

319
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,422
HoId it!

320
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,201
shut up! Right now! shut up!

321
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,547
son of a bitch, what 's that?

322
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,911
Those kids must have brought
fireworks or something.

323
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,451
If the FAA knew about this,
they'd have both our asses.

324
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,987
Go back there
and teII them to stow it.

325
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,887
-The party's over untiI we Iand.
-Right.

326
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,237
-What 's going on?
-stay caIm. Be quiet.

327
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,379
Hey, what 's going.

328
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,218
Ouiet!

329
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,151
Ouiet!

330
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,255
Ouiet!

331
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,960
Davis 2 to HonoIuIu, come in!
Davis 2 to HonoIuIu, come in!

332
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,696
One more word and it 's your Iast.

333
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,398
You won't puII that trigger.
You need me to piIot the pIane.

334
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,508
Try me.

335
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:38,746
Davls 2, thls ls Hlckham,over.

336
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,514
Just fIy the pIane.

337
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,744
Davls 2, thls ls Hlckham.

338
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,890
-What are we going to do?
-I want you to stay caIm, okay?

339
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,197
Let 's see if we can find a
dumbwaiter out there. Come on.

340
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,495
Why? What wouId that do?

341
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,572
Get us away from the bad guys,
for starters. Come on, give me a hand.

342
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,920
-Out of ammo?
-CouId be. But I doubt it.

343
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,826
It seems we may have
underestimated Mr. Babysitter.

344
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,928
There's nowhere to run! You know?

345
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,503
Why don't we just put aII our weapons
down and sort this thing out?

346
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,471
What do you say?

347
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:44,875
Come on.

348
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,805
Come on. Come on.

349
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:16,141
This shouId hoId them off for
a IittIe bit. Come on, this way.

350
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,541
Come on.

351
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,054
They've escaped to the Iower hoId.

352
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,588
If this guy's the kind
of guy I think he is...

353
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,057
we've got an ambush
waiting beIow.

354
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,388
Go up front and find
another way down.

355
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,156
You got it.

356
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,968
They've escaped to the Iower hoId!

357
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,576
CarI and Joseph just went
down the main eIevator.

358
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,678
Go back and guard the
rear one, just in case.

359
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,405
And Gustav?

360
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:52,776
Go!

361
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,942
And that, Iadies
and gentIemen...

362
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,816
ends the entertainment
portion of our fIight.

363
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,753
And now if you wouId kindIy
your seat beIts...

364
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,325
we're expecting some
more turbuIence ahead.

365
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,727
Pardon me?

366
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:11,266
What if you have to go, you know.

367
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,005
HoId it.

368
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:34,857
so you're saying that the entire
fIight crew they found dead?

369
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,391
AII made to Iook Iike accidents.
These preps were very thorough.

370
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,028
You think my daughter's
in some sort of troubIe?

371
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,822
I think the entire
fIight is in troubIe.

372
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,727
Despite he size of the pIane
this was not a pubIic fIight...

373
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,868
therefore no security precautions.

374
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,237
Pardon me, sir.
We tried contacting Davis 2...

375
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,065
but so far no response.

376
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:52,436
The towers Iinked up with
PearI and ManiIa, not a peep, sir.

377
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,305
Any change? TrianguIations?

378
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:56,707
Any change in vector?

379
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,382
The pIane's stiII on course,
sir. No deviation.

380
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,314
WeII, perhaps a monsoon took
out the communication system.

381
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,782
It wouId take something
reaIIy bad to knock out...

382
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,081
voice communication
with today's technoIogy.

383
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,185
That 's what I'm afraid of.

384
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:12,151
I see your point.
Get GeneraI McCIoren on the ceII.

385
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:15,560
-sir, it 's after midnight.
-Get him on the ceII.

386
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,324
Right away, sir.

387
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,602
I think you were right, Mac.
This storm ain't bIowing over.

388
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,511
-What, sir?
-Hey, Captain's taIking to you.

389
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,880
Oh, sorry, sir.
What were you saying?

390
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,590
I said, the storm seems
to have intensified.

391
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,850
Oh, you're right about that, sir.

392
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,427
Weather service in PearI said they're
going up Category 5. First in years.

393
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,892
WeII, Captain, Iooks Iike our
airship's gonna be in...

394
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,829
about ten feet of water
come sunday.

395
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,629
That airfieId is stiII going
to be buiIt, Lieutenant.

396
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,272
Oh, yes sir. And I think we're aII
Iooking forward to strapping on...

397
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,374
that scuba gear tomorrow
to get it finished.

398
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,338
You're crazy.
Oh, Captain, something eIse.

399
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:02,705
What 's that, Mac?

400
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,073
Lot of miIitary chatter
about a private jetIiner...

401
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,945
747 is not responding to
ground communication.

402
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,643
-What 's it 's position?
-Last time I checked?

403
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,049
Due West 1,5OO miIes.

404
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,390
-Is the Air Force on it?
-No, sr.

405
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,651
Everything's grounded at the moment.

406
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,191
I'm going to check on a generator.

407
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,190
-Keep me posted.
-Yes, sr.

408
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,210
Here, come on. stay here.

409
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,677
-I'm caIIing for heIp.
-That 's not gonna work.

410
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,514
-It worked earIier.
-We were over Iand.

411
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:48,021
We're mid-Pacific. There's not
many reIay dishes ut here.

412
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,251
-Doesn't hurt to try.
-AII right, be my guest.

413
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,991
Come on, you stupid.

414
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,095
Okay, so you're right.
I was just trying to heIp.

415
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,064
Pipe down.
They might be abIe to hear us.

416
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,676
But you wedged the eIevator door.

417
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,002
That 's in the back of the pIane.
There's one more...

418
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:10,237
in the front of the pIane.
They might be going there.

419
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:13,815
-What do you think they want?
-My guess is it 's you, sweetheart.

420
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,215
-Me? Why me?
-For one, your Daddy's rich.

421
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,946
Two, he's got access
to a Iot of miIitary information.

422
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,648
And three you're
the onIy daughter he's got.

423
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,421
You stay here.

424
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,993
Where are you going now?

425
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,966
I'm going hunting.

426
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,927
WeII how many buIIets
do you have Ieft?

427
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,231
-I've got six.
-But there's 5 of them.

428
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,499
Never hurts to bring a spare.

429
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,958
HoId it!

430
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:35,863
Drop it.

431
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,697
I don't know
who the HeII you are...

432
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,236
but I'm definiteIy gonna enjoy this.

433
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,745
-What 's that?
-We're Iosing fueI. I don't know why.

434
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,614
WeII find out fast.

435
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,620
Didn't I teII you to stay put?

436
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,855
-But I.
-Forget it. Don't.

437
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:45,524
You did good. Now give me
a hand getting these weapons.

438
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,665
You've shot a weapon
before, haven't you?

439
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:52,502
-Me? Are you kidding?
-That 's what I thought.

440
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,906
-What 's happened?
-A rupture in one of the fueI Iines.

441
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,448
-Can you stop it?
-I don't know.

442
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,882
I've got to shut off the main
source to engines 1 and 3.

443
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,318
Wait, wait. No you're not.

444
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,591
We're Ioosing too much fueI. It 's the
onIy way to conserve what we have.

445
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,454
Just hoId it!

446
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,890
Give me the microphone! Give me.

447
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,729
Carlos, we need
you up front rlght now.

448
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,000
Now you be good IittIe boys
and girIs whiIe I'm gone.

449
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:29,144
Or I'II be forced to come and bIow
your brains aII over the cabin.

450
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,805
Understand?

451
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,281
Understand?

452
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,920
Very good.

453
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:46,561
We have to do something.
We can't just sit here.

454
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,630
-WeII, what can we do?
-I don't know. something.

455
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,129
Yeah, maybe we can hit him over the
head with empty champagne bottIes.

456
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,804
WeII, that 's better than
Ietting them just kiII us.

457
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,769
What makes you think
they're gonna kiII us?

458
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:01,240
Maybe they're just gonna Iet us go.
Maybe it 's just RocheIIe they want.

459
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:05,447
What are you trying to say? That we
shouId just hand her over to them?

460
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,680
No...
That 's not what I meant.

461
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:10,177
That 's what it sounded Iike.

462
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:15,518
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know.
I'm just reaIIy scared, guys.

463
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:19,056
Besides, Jen, get a cIue.
They hijacked a pIane.

464
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,855
They can't afford to Ieave
any witnesses behind.

465
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,557
-What the HeII's going on?
-Ruptured fueI Iine.

466
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,792
-He wants to shut down 2 engines.
-No, you can't.

467
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,800
If I don't, we'II never
make it to AustraIia.

468
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:30,906
We're not going to AustraIia!
We're going to Mindanao.

469
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,099
WeII HeII, we'II never
make it there either!

470
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,778
You shut down 2 engines,
that puts a strain on the other 2.

471
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,107
They'II burn extra fueI
just to keep us airborne.

472
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,977
At the rate we're Iosing fueI, we'II
be Iucky to have another 2 hours.

473
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:44,416
-I stiII don't Iike it!
-Like it or not, you got no choice.

474
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:50,991
AII right, then. Just do what you
must do and then shut up!

475
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:58,165
-she's right. They'II kiII us.
-We don't know that.

476
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,395
We don't know that they won't.
I'm not wiIIing to take that chance.

477
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:03,937
What do you want to do?

478
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:07,037
Dig around.
Find something to fight with.

479
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:09,508
-Hey man, they've got guns.
-Ouit being a wimp!

480
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,519
Can I heIp you find
another drink, sir?

481
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:21,948
Um, I'm sorry. We...
We were just Iooking for some...

482
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,617
And when you finish doing the
dishes, my dear, dear friend...

483
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,323
you can cIean the toiIets.

484
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,264
Back to your seats!

485
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:43,572
Now, if you're reaI good boys,
I'II Iet the girIs cut...

486
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,841
hoIes in your gags so you can
eat through a straw.

487
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:54,050
Anybody eIse want to be a hero?

488
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,434
What are you doing?

489
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,667
Here.

490
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,873
Listen, I need you to
go back up there.

491
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,875
What? Are you crazy?

492
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,809
I'm not going back up there!
They'II kiII me!

493
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,711
No, they want you aIive.
It 's me they want to kiII.

494
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,876
-Not very comforting.
-Look, RocheIIe.

495
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:26,921
These guys up there,
they're professionaIs.

496
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:30,558
They're not gonna hesitate one
second to kiII anybody on this pIane.

497
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,793
And you are their Ieverage.

498
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,055
Down here we're running out of time,
and up there, they're running...

499
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:38,598
out of patience.
You've got to trust me on this one.

500
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:43,696
-What are you gonna do?
-I'II crawI up the Iavatory Iines...

501
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,171
to the restroom in the
center of the pIane.

502
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:49,072
I want you to wait here for
5 minutes and then head up.

503
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:52,414
Whoever is gonna be there is
gonna be keyed on you.

504
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:55,048
That 's nuts.
What if you're wrong?

505
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,776
I'm not.

506
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,189
Look, you got a better
idea I'd Iove to hear it.

507
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,318
How about we stay down here
and Iook for a coupIe parachutes.

508
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:03,584
Look...

509
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,786
I know you're scared.
Anybody wouId be.

510
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,463
But we've got
to take the offensive here.

511
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,030
Do I get a gun?

512
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,910
No. You get a watch.

513
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:26,446
Now, you wait here for 5 minutes
and then head up. AII right?

514
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,480
Okay. 5 minutes.

515
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:38,120
But I stiII wouId rather have a gun.

516
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,296
You Ieave that to me.

517
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,024
GeneraI, we haven't been
abIe to raise the piIot.

518
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,388
-I'm really gettlng concerned.
-WeII I share your concern, Davis.

519
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:16,031
PAC-CON has aIready
been aIerted to the situation.

520
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,393
This storm is making it...

521
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,933
extremeIy difficuIt
for us to run reconnaissance.

522
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:23,106
You're not thinking about taking
that pIane down, are you?

523
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,207
I'm in no position to make
that decision right now.

524
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,172
We're just trying to
re-estabIish contact.

525
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:30,175
But for allwe know,
mlght be a slmple malfunctlon.

526
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,372
You just sit tlght and I'll get you
lntel as it comes ln.

527
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,313
Yeah. Thank you, GeneraI.

528
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:39,255
Was that McCIoren again?

529
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:42,550
Yeah. TaIking about them
being in radio range.

530
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:44,386
Might have something to do
with the storm.

531
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:45,823
Did you teII him what happened
to the fIight crew?

532
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,054
Yeah, first thing. But he's pIaying it
cIose to the vest.

533
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,961
He knows my invoIvement,
and it 's too cIose.

534
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,865
I just hope that your guy on
board doesn't get compromised.

535
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:16,318
They'II be Iooking for us.
You'II never get away with this.

536
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,090
I aIready did, IittIe girI.

537
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,603
Ouiet, pIease.

538
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,210
AII right? Just don't Iook.
Don't Iook.

539
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,540
Just keep thinking, we've got
2 more to go. Just 2 more to go.

540
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,145
AII right?

541
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,843
Now Iisten to me. I want you to
stay here. You'II be safe.

542
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,648
I'm just going forward, okay?
see if I can put this mess to an end.

543
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,149
-Wait a minute.
-Why? What is it?

544
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:58,820
I...

545
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,991
I'd Iike to say I'm sorry.

546
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,257
Wow. An apoIogy.

547
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,770
Look, I know I was being a
bit harsh before...

548
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,941
but try to see it my way.

549
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:13,734
Lord knows, I've been trying.

550
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,511
Being a Davis has its advantages...

551
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:19,079
but it has its disadvantages too.

552
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,613
I thought you were another
one of my Father's...

553
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:23,718
endIess stream of fIunkies
sent to spy on me.

554
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,582
WeII, to teII you the
truth, I kind of was.

555
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,089
ApoIogy accepted.

556
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,230
Now pIease stay here.
You wiII be safe.

557
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,291
-Right.
-I'II Iet you know when you can Ieave.

558
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,493
-Right. Be carefuI.
-Okay, come on.

559
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,780
-shit!
-What?

560
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,415
No service. I can't raise anybody.

561
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,380
There's no teIIing Lao
secured our Ianding.

562
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,143
I know him. He'II be ready.

563
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,652
And neither CarI nor Joseph
have checked in.

564
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,421
What?

565
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,794
-Where are you going?
-Down beIow. I'II fIush them out.

566
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,691
No! Let them be for now.
They can't go anywhere.

567
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,358
We'II get them when
we're safe on the ground!

568
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,331
Look, if you intend on
pIacing this aircraft.

569
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:16,165
on any major Iand mass
West of here, you can forget it.

570
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,965
There just simpIy
isn't enough fueI Ieft.

571
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,905
OnIy course of action is to turn
around and try to make Hawaii.

572
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:22,339
I think we just might make it.

573
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:25,709
And come down into hordes of waiting
FBI, poIice, and miIitary?

574
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,408
No, my friend, I'm not buying your
IittIe taIe of woe this evening.

575
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:34,682
I suggest you keep your mouth shut
and stay on course and do as I say.

576
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,426
You keep an eye on him.

577
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,387
I'II go back and check on Erica. Go!

578
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,784
sorry.

579
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:09,288
-I just had to go.
-sit back down.

580
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:10,858
Now!

581
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,723
Everyone wiII have a potty
break when I get back!

582
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,302
Are you okay?

583
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,818
I wouId have preferred the fish.

584
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:42,150
sorry to disappoint you, sir.

585
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:44,493
That 's okay.

586
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,694
I'II take the dessert.

587
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,392
I suppose it 's fair to assume
my assistant in the rear...

588
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:55,503
...isn't having dinner tonight.
-I beIieve she Iost he appetite.

589
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:01,474
My, my. Daddy must be
paying you overtime.

590
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,077
I work on a fIat rate.

591
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,985
Masters! Masters!

592
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,195
This fIight 's over for you, paI.

593
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,230
-Masters.
-RocheIIe, you aII right?

594
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,837
I think so. What happened?

595
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:12,870
TurbuIence.

596
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,100
Hey!

597
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,302
Whoa, whoa. It 's just me.

598
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:20,483
-What happened to the other one?
-In the cockpit. she's dead.

599
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:22,709
The piIot 's been shot. We need heIp.

600
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:25,387
Go get a coupIe of your friends
and bring him back here.

601
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,681
We need to drag this piece
of shit back to first cIass.

602
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:30,917
-Find something to tie him up with.
-It wouId be a pIeasure.

603
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,118
-see if you can find a first aid kit.
-Jerry's pre-med.

604
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,491
-I'II teII him to come back.
-It 's not for us.

605
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,428
It 's for the Captain.

606
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:54,439
AII right, come on Captain. stay with
us. stay with us, you're gonna be ok.

607
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:56,744
Come on, you're doing great.

608
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,915
I think we found some more
cord in the utiIity gaIIey.

609
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,320
Tom and Jeff are tying
him up right now.

610
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:06,152
And we'II get
that body out of here, too.

611
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,421
Thanks.

612
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,962
-How you doing, Captain?
-Not good...

613
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,566
-What 's the situation?
-Worse.

614
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:16,466
We Iost aII auxiIiary fueI, and
there's Iess than 5,OOO pounds Ieft.

615
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,469
-so what can we do?
-We've got to turn around.

616
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:21,906
We've got to head
back to Hawaii.

617
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,011
Oh my God! What are we gonna do?
Crash?

618
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:31,242
-Oh Jeez, teII me you can fIy.
-Yeah, I can fIy aII right.

619
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:33,752
It 's just the Ianding part that
gets me a IittIe bit worried.

620
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:36,255
What do you mean, the Ianding part?
That 's the most important part!

621
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:37,323
Oh my God.

622
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:41,294
-I found the kit.
-Thanks. Try to keep him aIive.

623
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:42,956
What are you doing?

624
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:46,158
I'm gonna try and do
the same thing for the rest of us.

625
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:49,167
Mayday, mayday.
Come in, pIease.

626
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:50,839
Come in, pIease.

627
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,009
This is Charter fIight Davis 2,
decIaring an emergency.

628
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,735
Low on fueI.
Changing course to Hawaii.

629
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:17,626
Can't make it back now.
Can't make it back.

630
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:20,428
What, Captain?
You're okay now.

631
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,662
It 's okay.

632
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:24,666
How's he doing?

633
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:29,808
He doesn't know what he's saying.
I managed to stop the bIeeding.

634
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,377
Is he gonna make it?

635
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,013
WeII if he is, we've got to get
him to a hospitaI soon.

636
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:37,914
-How Iong does he have?
-I don't know, it 's hard to say.

637
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,112
He's Iost a Iot of bIood.

638
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,654
A coupIe hours at the most.

639
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,929
Captain, can you hear me?

640
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:49,356
Yes.

641
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:55,067
I know you're in a Iot of pain, but
you've got to hang in there for me.

642
00:57:55,605 --> 00:58:00,565
Okay. I've got to make it back.
I've got a daughter, too.

643
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,374
You're gonna puII
through this just fine.

644
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,605
You've got one of the
best pre-med students...

645
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,942
I've ever known Iooking out for you.

646
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,585
-Isn't that right, Jerry?
-That 's right.

647
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,554
Okay. Thank you.

648
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,215
Thank you.

649
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:20,224
I'm gonna go up and taIk to Masters.
I'II Iet you know what 's going on.

650
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:21,920
Right.

651
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,815
No, he's right here.
Excuse me, sir?

652
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:51,223
We've made contact with Davis 2.

653
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:53,418
ApparentIy there was an
attempt to take over the pIane...

654
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,257
but your man put it down.

655
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,592
There's a fueI Ieak.
But most on board are okay.

656
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,769
-What about my daughter?
-Ask for yourseIf.

657
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:04,973
RocheIIe, my God.
Are you aII right?

658
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,471
Yes,Dad, thanks to Masters.

659
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,739
Listen, don't panic.
I'II get you out of this.

660
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,575
Let me talk to the pllot.

661
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,841
Okay! He wants to taIk to you.

662
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,587
This is Masters.
Come back.

663
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,090
Masters?
What are you doing in the cockpit?

664
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:27,558
The co-piIot is dead, and the
piIot has been severeIy wounded.

665
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:30,460
-Who's fIying the pIane?
-I am, sir.

666
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,159
Can you fIy that bird, Major?

667
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:35,937
I beIieve I can, sir.

668
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,804
-Excuse me, sir?
-HoId on.

669
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,742
Hey, Major, can my
daughter hear this?

670
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:48,612
-No, I'm on headset.
-Good. I owe you big time for this.

671
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,285
But you're not out of the woods yet.

672
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,885
My experts have analyzed
yourcoordlnates...

673
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,057
and the way
you're gulplng down fuel...

674
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,886
it won't be enough
to get you back to Hawall.

675
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,289
Wow, that 's fantastic news, sir.

676
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:03,259
Just what I needed to hear.
Any suggestions?

677
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,393
I've been in touch with
GeneraI McCIoren...

678
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,901
and we'II try to find
you a cIoser airstrip within range...

679
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,573
of your fueI capacity.
I'II have to Iet you know.

680
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:14,869
PIease do. Davis 2 out.

681
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:17,844
Is everything okay?

682
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,311
Oh yeah. CouIdn't be better.

683
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,261
-A 747, GeneraI?
-That 's right, Captain...

684
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,059
and there's no other
pIace to Iand.

685
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,531
Our runway won't accommodate
a pIane of that size, GeneraI.

686
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:43,103
We need at Ieast
another hundred yards.

687
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,434
WeII, Captain, then I suggest you
wake your men up and you...

688
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,235
get out there and you get me
that other hundred yards.

689
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:51,205
Look,you don't have much tlme
untll that plane's on top of you.

690
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:55,077
l know clrcumstances aren't ldeal,
but you do the best you can.

691
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:57,442
Yes sir, GeneraI.

692
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,521
Not ideaI circumstances?
Come on, Captain!

693
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,190
It 's the understatement of the century!

694
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,689
TeII me about it.

695
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,589
AII right, teII me if I got this right.
They want us to get out there,

696
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,423
cIear an extra hundred
yards of runway...

697
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,293
before that pIane gets here,
in a Category 3 hurricane.

698
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,096
That 's impossibIe!

699
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,702
What 's the matter, Lieutenant?
You afraid of getting wet?

700
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:16,894
I am.

701
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,267
It 's what our job is.
We do the impossibIe.

702
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:22,444
Mac, break out the rain gear.
We got some work to do.

703
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,100
AII right, men, Iet 's hit it!

704
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:49,669
Yes sir!

705
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:12,719
Davis 2 here.

706
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,294
Major, this is GeneraI McCIoren.

707
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:15,622
Yes,slr?

708
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,198
I need you to change the vector on
your coordinates as soon as you can.

709
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,528
Latitude 61 South...

710
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:24,136
Longitude 121 degrees East.

711
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,329
sir?

712
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:29,044
There's a smaII spot in the middIe of
the Pacific caIIed Neptune AtoII.

713
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:32,339
lt's a tracklng statlon. Or at least
it wlll be wh we're flnlshed with it.

714
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,516
But it's got a runway.

715
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:37,381
A runway? On the atoII?

716
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,882
You heard me, Major.

717
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,722
-Paved, sir?
-l can't be sure of that.

718
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,620
lt's gonna be rough,but at thls
polnt we have no otheroptlon.

719
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,885
You don't have enough
fuel to get to Hawall.

720
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,497
Now, they've got your frequency
and they're on ALS.

721
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,567
so as soon as you get
in range, they'II contact you.

722
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,169
Roger that, sir.

723
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:57,664
McCloren out.

724
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:02,209
We don't have enough
fueI to get to Hawaii?

725
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:04,913
I'm sorry that you had to hear that.

726
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:08,112
But I think it 's better that
you're in the Ioop.

727
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,317
so when were you pIanning
on teIIing us?

728
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:14,249
Just before we crashed?

729
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,386
Listen, RocheIIe, I'm not
going to Iie to you.

730
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:21,256
The deck is kind of stacked
against us on this one.

731
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,955
But I've done some of my
best work with worse odds.

732
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:28,835
I promise you that I'II do the best
I can to get you and your friends...

733
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,938
on the ground safeIy.

734
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,738
CaII me crazy...

735
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:40,576
but I beIieve you.

736
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,276
AII right, crazy.

737
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,587
Just keep me posted what 's
going on in the back.

738
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:50,950
You got it.

739
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:15,975
AII right, gentIemen!

740
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:19,946
There's not much time
to get this job done!

741
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:23,592
It doesn't have to be pretty,
and it doesn't have to be nice!

742
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:27,251
It just has to be a hundred extra
yards of runway. Understand?

743
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:29,321
We'II get it done, sir!

744
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:31,733
AII right, then.

745
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,366
-Mac, it 's WiIIiams.
-Yes, sir!

746
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:37,266
Did you hear from that pIane yet?

747
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:40,067
I got it on radar at the outer marker.
But stiII no voice contact.

748
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,204
Keep trying.
Let me know when you got her.

749
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:44,436
Yes sir.

750
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:45,874
Out!

751
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,724
L.A. Base to Davls 2.

752
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:04,900
L.A. Base to Davls 2.

753
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:07,797
Davis 2 responding.
Is that you, Neptune?

754
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,367
No, Masters, it 's Davis.

755
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:12,468
I'm on a relay through Honolulu.

756
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:14,575
I was just checking
in on your status.

757
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,836
WeII, to be quite honest,
sir, not good.

758
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:19,706
We're burnlng fuel much
fasterthan expected.

759
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,043
And there's no margln forerror
lf we reach the atoll.

760
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:24,544
What do you mean, ''if?''

761
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,618
I think you know what
I'm saying, sir.

762
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,787
Major, I know you're
doing aII you can.

763
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:35,921
How's my daughter hoIding up?

764
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:40,434
WeII, she knows the probIem
we're facing. They aII do.

765
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,503
lt wouldn't have been rlght to
keep them ln the dark.

766
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:47,908
Yeah. Major...

767
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:51,072
if the situation up there
starts to deteriorate.

768
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,545
I'd appreciate it if you couId bring
my daughter to the radio for.

769
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:58,248
sir, that 's Neptune breaking
through now.

770
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,685
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to sign
off and finaIize coordinates.

771
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:03,324
Yeah, yeah.

772
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,056
Davis 2, we've got you in ILs...

773
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:10,824
but we show your compass
deviating maybe 2 degrees.

774
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,558
PIease aIter heading to 1 Niner 1.

775
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:16,464
Change to 1 Niner 1.

776
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:19,165
Read you cIear Davis 2,
and do me a favor...

777
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,172
skip the ''Neptune.''
The name is Mac.

778
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:24,044
sounds good, Mac.
And it 's John.

779
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:27,477
Be nlce to see a lit runway
lnstead of all thls blackness.

780
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:29,548
WeII, I can sympathize
with you there.

781
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:31,583
Listen, we got a team out there
working on it right now.

782
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:33,582
Pardon me, Mac. say again?

783
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,654
I thought for a moment
you said ''working on it.

784
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:38,383
Uh, yes sir.
Didn't anybody teII you?

785
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:41,594
-TeII me what?
-Our runway...

786
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:43,822
couldn't accommodate a
plane your slze,Slr.

787
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:46,661
We've got a whole team
out there rlght now expandlng it.

788
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:47,927
Terrific.

789
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,999
Nice to know.
Let 's hope they're fast workers.

790
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,402
Hey, we're the Army Corps, sir.

791
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:56,100
We wiII have it ready.
You just keep fIying that pIane.

792
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,746
As Iong as I can, Mac.

793
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:00,540
As Iong as I can.

794
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,865
Captain,
we've got ourseIves a probIem!

795
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:05,074
For once you're right, Lieutenant.
That 's a probIem.

796
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:11,210
Mac, what 's the ETA on that jetIiner?

797
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,445
Less than 2O minutes, sir.

798
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:16,048
Dam nit, we need more time.

799
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,217
What 's the fueI status on the jet?

800
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,723
WeII, he bareIy has enough
to get here now, sir.

801
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:28,101
Listen, teII him to
begin his descent now.

802
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:31,068
Lower hls flaps,pull
back on the throttle.

803
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:34,706
That 'II reduce his airspeed and
cut back on the fueI consumption.

804
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:35,934
You understand?

805
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:38,805
I copy, Captain.
Over and out.

806
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:42,509
Lieutenant.

807
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:46,017
You take a couple of your men,
go overto the supply depot...

808
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:50,158
and pick up as much expIosives as you
can get your hands on. You got that?

809
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:54,090
Copy that, sir! One super-sized order
of semtex coming up!

810
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,647
I suppose you want
something to drink, too.

811
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:16,849
Thanks.
Water wouId be fine.

812
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:32,766
My kind of girI.

813
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:35,596
Why wouId you do this?
You put us aII in jeopardy.

814
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:39,768
Economics, my dear.
simpIe economics.

815
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:43,707
Don't worry.
It 'II be over very soon.

816
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,109
You got that right.

817
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:01,621
FIaps down
and Ianding gear down.

818
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:02,854
Roger that.

819
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,794
Hey Mac...

820
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:08,697
you wouIdn't happen to have some rum
on that isIand, wouId you?

821
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:12,362
Depends on who's asking.
For you, I might have about 3 cases.

822
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:15,337
Good. When we get there,
you mix up the drinks...

823
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:18,308
I'II bring the Iobster, some caviar,
and some crab Iegs.

824
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,141
Johnny, my man, you got a deaI.

825
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,909
Just don't teII the feIIas you got
Iobster 'cause they wiII scarf it.

826
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:26,212
Fine with me. I hate Iobster.
Why don't you get me some steak?

827
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:30,119
WeII, for you my man, I'II see if
I can accommodate you on that one.

828
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:31,691
I'II fire up the griII.

829
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,756
I Iike mine weII done.

830
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:36,830
Johnny, my man,
it wiII be ready to serve...

831
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:39,500
by the time you get here.
Just Iand that pIane for me.

832
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:42,227
Thanks Mac.
I'II get back to you shortIy.

833
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:43,564
Masters out.

834
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:47,130
Coffee?

835
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:49,436
Make sure everyone's
strapped into their seats.

836
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:53,172
It 's gonna get pretty hairy the
cIoser we get to the Ianding strip.

837
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,187
-I'II go make sure everyone's okay.
-Good.

838
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,823
Do you think we used
enough expIosives?

839
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,831
We'd better! You used
everything we had, right?

840
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:13,831
Every Iast bit!

841
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,264
That pIane's gonna
be here any minute...

842
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:16,631
and we stiII have
to Iight the runway.

843
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,136
WeII how the HeII are
we gonna do that?

844
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,069
We're gonna use an
oId WorId War 2 trick.

845
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,504
What WorId War 2 trick?

846
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,302
When they didn't
have Iights for the runway...

847
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:26,742
they dug a trough aIong the border
and fiIIed it with gasoIine.

848
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:30,612
The Iight from the burning gas wouId
be enough to give a Ianding corridor.

849
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:34,220
Now when the bomb goes off, that 's
gonna ignite the gas in the trough.

850
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:36,414
WeII isn't that gonna be dangerous?
I thought they were Ieaking fueI!

851
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:39,992
That doesn't matter, by the time they
get here they'II be running on empty.

852
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:42,629
Let 's get aII the men together and
start digging those troughs!

853
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,458
-Yes, sir!
-Let 's go!

854
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:53,973
Hey Mac. John.

855
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:55,700
Yeah. Go ahead, John.

856
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:58,310
Yeah,looklng for a status
report on the runway.

857
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:01,210
-And make it a good one.
-lt's looklng pretty clear,Masters.

858
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,041
The area's aImost cIear for Ianding.

859
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:06,186
AImost? We're running
out of time here.

860
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:07,753
It 'II be ready, aII right?

861
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,617
But I can't share the same
optimism on the weather front.

862
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:12,225
Man, the eye of the storm is
headed right for us.

863
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:16,128
What 's the current veIocity
of the eye waII?

864
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:18,932
Well, the wlnds are blowlng
East-Southeast across...

865
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:21,830
the runway at approxlmately
60 to 75 knots.

866
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,904
-75 knots?
-some gusts up to 1OO.

867
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,041
You can't Iand a pIane
in a crosswind Iike that.

868
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:29,904
More gusts
and we're troIIing for tuna.

869
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:33,047
I know, Buddy.
You might have to try a sIip move.

870
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:35,341
sIip a 747?

871
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:38,311
HeII. Mac, that 's something
you do in a Cessna!

872
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,681
Look, buddy, I know.
But if you don't...

873
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:44,188
she wiII roII over Iike
a st. Bernard in heat.

874
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:48,196
And the hits just keep on coming.

875
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:59,133
When that pIane is ten miIes out...

876
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:01,901
I'm bIowing those charges, so dig!

877
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:06,503
-We're through about 2OO feet, sir!
-Good job, Edwards.

878
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,013
Come on, men, we've got
to catch up! Let 's go!

879
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:20,820
This pIane feeIs Iike
it 's gonna break apart.

880
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:23,930
It might. I aIready Iost
haIf of my gauges.

881
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,226
Why don't you have a seat?
Enjoy the view.

882
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:31,937
some view.

883
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:36,336
If the gau ges aren't working, how
wiII we know if we've gone too Iow?

884
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:39,878
WeII, you'II see some fish
swimming by the window.

885
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:43,807
I bet you Iove every minute of this.

886
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,011
Oh, you must be taIking about
the part where your entire Iife...

887
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:51,022
is faIIing into the hands
of a man you utterIy despise.

888
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:53,224
Yeah. something Iike that.

889
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,359
WeII, despise is a strong word...

890
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:58,829
but if you crash this
pIane, aII bets are off.

891
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,164
Johnny,it's Mac.
We've got a little problem.

892
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,099
You know the winds
are getting stronger?

893
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,201
What 's it reading now?

894
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:07,398
The wlnds are gustlng
up to 11O knots.

895
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,804
Look,l got to shoot stralght.
You're not...

896
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,775
gonna be able to make a
dlrect landlngwithout a sllp.

897
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,039
- Easy for you to say.
-What 's he taIking about?

898
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:15,375
What 's a sIip?

899
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:18,847
It 's a perpendicuIar
4-stage approach.

900
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:22,080
The fuII fIaps are under the pIane
at an angIe into the wind.

901
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,954
In about 3OO feet before it 's
touchdown I correct he descent...

902
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:28,356
and take it nose-first
toward the runway.

903
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:29,886
What?!

904
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:33,293
In other words,
we're coming in sideways!

905
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:36,003
Oh Jeez, I shouIdn't
have come up here.

906
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:38,672
Maybe you shouId
warn your friends.

907
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:41,672
No, no, no, stay here.
Use the intercom.

908
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:43,434
Okay, okay.

909
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:45,205
Attention everyone.

910
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:47,677
We are mlnutes away
from our destlnatlon.

911
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:50,181
Make sure your seat
belts are securely fastened.

912
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:51,943
and prepare yourself for a landlng.

913
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,987
l know thls wasn't exactly
the vacatlon you expected...

914
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,057
but, we've got an experlenced pllot
flylng and I'm sure we'll all be safe.

915
01:14:58,427 --> 01:14:59,951
Stay calm...

916
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:04,862
assume crash positlons,and we'll
have landed before you even notlce.

917
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:11,670
-How did I do?
-Like a pro.

918
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:15,276
Okay, okay!

919
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:18,606
AII right, we're gonna
bIow it, men! Come on!

920
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:21,977
Let 's get the HeII out of here!
Go, go, go!

921
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:28,647
Give me a detonator!

922
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:32,856
-You're hot, sir!
-Get down, men!

923
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:42,896
-What the HeII's going on, Lieutenant?
-I don't know, sir!

924
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:45,403
Give me the battery
from your waIkie-taIkie.

925
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:47,040
Here you go!

926
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:55,078
-The pIane, boss, the pIane!
-I'm working on it, I'm working on it.

927
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,946
-We're running out of time!
-I'm working on it.

928
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:00,621
I hope this works.

929
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:19,002
What 's with the fires, Mac?
Did you burn my steak?

930
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:22,734
Have to make some homemade
Ianding Iights to Iight your runway.

931
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:26,278
-Hey, thls ls not LAX,you know.
-Don't I know it.

932
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:32,345
This baby's being bIown sideways!
I'm beginning to sIip!

933
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:33,713
Rogerthat.

934
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,059
Piece of cake.

935
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:47,960
-Here we go!
-Oh my God!

936
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,168
How's it golng,John?

937
01:16:57,379 --> 01:17:00,177
If we had deckchairs,
we'd be sIiding overboard!

938
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:31,245
Mac, I hope you boys
are ready for us!

939
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:33,573
We got it here.
Bring that monster down.

940
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:35,510
I'm trying!

941
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:38,578

946
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:53,728

Okay, okay. Keep moving, champ.

Don't worry,

-I hope it 's big enough for two.
-Why's that?
