1
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,189
是时候感受一下飞速滑行的感觉了
It's time to ride the slide and taste the wind.

2
00:01:03,256 --> 00:01:05,156
汉弗莱  你真是个天才
Humphrey, you are totally genius.

3
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,322
快点  要出发啦
Come on. Let's do it.

4
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:09,418
风之狼
Air wolf!

5
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,765
同志们  同志们
Guys. Guys.

6
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:20,002
我们还在原地呢
We're not moving!

7
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,205
这驯鹿是我的了
This caribou is mine.

8
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,971
凯特  人家不是驯鹿  我可是你妹妹
Kate, I'm not a caribou. I'm your sister!

9
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:32,443
抓住你了
Gotcha.

10
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,646
欧米加可不玩这些
Omegas don't play like this.

11
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:37,584
没人能逃出史上最强大的阿尔法之手
You can't escape the greatest Alpha ever.

12
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,447
是嘛  我刚不就逃脱了
Well, I just did.

13
00:01:44,364 --> 00:01:45,592
我们要完蛋了
We're going to die!

14
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:47,690
保持平衡  控制好
Keep it steady! Keep it steady!

15
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:51,966
我刚刚大脑短路了吗
What was I thinking?

16
00:01:58,244 --> 00:01:59,677
棒极了
That was great!

17
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:01,441
同志们  今天我们成功飞天了
We are flying today, guys.

18
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,611
汉弗莱  怎么是你
Humphrey?

19
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:08,779
凯特  是你啊
Kate?

20
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,734
你在这里干嘛呢
What are you doing up here?

21
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:30,639
我在练习捕猎午餐呢
I'm practice hunting for our lunch.

22
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,105
正好  我快要把我的午餐吐出来了
Good, 'cause I'm about to lose mine.

23
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:34,640
是吗
You are?

24
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:36,409
我会努力咽下去的
I'll try to swallow it.

25
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,314
凯特
Kate!

26
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:41,876
是时候回去了
It's time to go.

27
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:43,855
就来  老爸
I'm coming, Dad.

28
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:45,151
你去哪儿
Where're you going?

29
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:47,625
阿尔法学校  要上到春季呢
Alpha school. It goes till spring.

30
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,326
春季吗
Spring?

31
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:51,420
但还有一整个冬天没过呢
But that's a whole winter away.

32
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:56,133
汉弗莱  我知道你是凯特的朋友
I know you're Kate's friend, Humphrey.

33
00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:59,638
但到了下个春季  她将是位受训的阿尔法
But by next spring, she will be a trained Alpha,

34
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:02,136
是整个群体的首领
the future leader of the pack.

35
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:07,441
毫无疑问你将是个聪明的欧米加
No doubt you'll be a clever Omega.

36
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,949
学着保持距离
Learn to keep the peace.

37
00:03:12,018 --> 00:03:13,542
并且  汉弗莱
And Humphrey,

38
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:16,851
要记得提醒大家享受生活啊
remind us all to have fun.

39
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:18,045
可是...  可是...
But... But...

40
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:20,149
阿尔法和欧米加不能...
Alphas and Omegas can't...

41
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:24,086
那话怎么说来着
How do you say it?

42
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:33,469
那是我们的习俗  狼群的法则
That's our custom. The law of the pack.

43
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,536
狼罗汉
Wolf pile!

44
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:41,613
幼稚的欧米加们
Silly Omegas.

45
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:20,287
阿尔法与欧米加

46
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:32,798
从林服务

47
00:04:34,088 --> 00:04:36,088
锯齿公园  钓鱼和打猎

48
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:46,745
左转弯  三十度
Take a left! Thirty degrees!

49
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:51,407
小咸  起帆
Salty, give us some sail draft!

50
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:54,381
我觉得我感受到了风的气息
I think I taste the wind.

51
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:56,319
不对  是虫的味道
No, just a bug.

52
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:01,056
穆池  准备好  调低帆桁
Hey, Mooch, get ready! Lower the boom!

53
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:06,064
-好嘞  -抓紧了  同志们
- All right! - Hang on, boys!

54
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,501
伙计们  我们真得练练...  刹车
Guys, we really need to work on the... brakes!

55
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,162
-刹车?  -刹车?
- Brakes? - Brakes?

56
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,635
狼罗汉
Wolf pile!

57
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:23,409
把你的屁股从我脸前挪开
Get your butt out of my face.

58
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:25,075
我们撞到什么了
What did we hit?

59
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:30,916
春天
Spring.

60
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:37,955
看看是谁从阿尔法学校回来了
Look who's back from Alpha school.

61
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:40,344
别妄想吃天鹅肉了  汉弗莱
Forget about it, Humphrey.

62
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:42,059
凯特现在是阿尔法了
Kate's an Alpha now.

63
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:43,898
而你还是欧米加
And you're an Omega.

64
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:46,939
我们就是朋友
We're friends, okay?

65
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:51,636
没错  就朋友打住
Exactly. Just friends. End of story.

66
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:54,612
你最好把目光调向那边
You better set your sights over there.

67
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:59,812
莉芭和珍妮丝  素食狼
Reba and Janice, the vegetarians.

68
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:05,146
好吧
Okay.

69
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,761
看来今晚我们有驯鹿肉吃了  伙计们
Looks like we're eating caribou tonight, boys.

70
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,092
看  看
Hey. Hey.

71
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,097
东部狼群
Eastern Pack wolves.

72
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,234
小能  浩池  我们有伴儿了
Can-do, Hutch, we've got company.

73
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:36,812
这下好了  晚餐就这样跑掉了
Great. There goes dinner.

74
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:38,550
凯特也跑了
And there goes Kate.

75
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,603
-天哪  -驯鹿
- Holy... - Caribou!

76
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:56,171
散开
Scatter to the sides!

77
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,711
看这身手之敏捷
Look at those moves.

78
00:07:07,754 --> 00:07:09,449
看领导我的
Settle the score, leader.

79
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:36,737
你还好吧
Are you all right?

80
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:40,081
-我还好  -你们到底什么毛病啊
- Yeah, I'm fine. - Hey, what's your problem,

81
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:43,281
你们这些东部蠢狗  那是我们的猎物
you stupid Eastern dog? That was our hunt.

82
00:07:43,356 --> 00:07:45,017
你不能像那样冲出来打草惊蛇
You can't just snake it out from under us.

83
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,558
小能  退后
Can-do, back off.

84
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:48,956
你最好听她说的
You better listen to the girl.

85
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:54,063
松开  小能  浩池  散开
Hey, break it up. Can-do, Hutch, break it up!

86
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:57,199
好了  欧米加们  该我们出手了
All right, Omegas, duty calls.

87
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,500
住手小能  浩池  住手
Stop it. Can-do, Hutch, stop!

88
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:01,563
-喂  -甜心
- Hey! - Candy!

89
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:07,976
-凯特  -汉弗莱
- Kate. - Humphrey?

90
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,981
我还是轻饶不了这个龅牙傻瓜
I'm still going to tear this snaggletooth fool apart.

91
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:14,218
伙计们  调低帆桁
Guys, lower the boom!

92
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:16,922
汉弗莱  我们没时间找乐子
Humphrey, we don't have time for fun.

93
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:31,495
同志们  算了  别把皮毛弄褶了
Guys, guys, come on. Don't get your fur in a bunch.

94
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:32,919
你们这群狼给我们抹黑
You wolves are making us look bad.

95
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,506
连驯鹿都笑话我们
Come on, the caribou are laughing at us.

96
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:39,000
那要是月亮  我可连嗥叫都想省了
Now, that's a moon I don't want to howl to.

97
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:45,640
西部狼群  回你们地盘去
Western hunt group, get back to the den.

98
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:50,621
你们两个  回家去
The two of you, go home.

99
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:52,615
走啊
Now!

100
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:57,852
欧米加们  干的好
Omegas, good job.

101
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:05,799
这可好  我的首猎竟被我搞砸了
Great. My first hunt, and I blew it.

102
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:07,533
凯特  凯特  凯特
Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate.

103
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:10,872
别责备自己了  你刚才帅呆了
Don't beat yourself up. That's crazy. You were amazing.

104
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:12,462
我是说  如果饿了
I mean, if anyone's hungry,

105
00:09:12,463 --> 00:09:13,844
我们还可以吃点...
they can eat...

106
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:17,380
他们可以吃...
They can always eat...

107
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,440
吃什么呢
What?

108
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:23,644
给
Here.

109
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:26,081
可以吃蓝莓
They can eat berries.

110
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:31,064
蓝莓非常有营养
Berries are really nutritious.

111
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:35,089
是吗  留着那话跟饥饿的狼群说去吧
Yeah. Tell that to a hungry pack.

112
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,635
东部狼群毁了凯特的狩猎
The Eastern Wolves ruined Kate's hunt.

113
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,942
幸运的是欧米加们在那里阻止了群架
Luckily, the Omegas were there to break up the fight.

114
00:10:29,855 --> 00:10:31,322
-莉莉  -怎么啦
- Lilly. - What?

115
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:35,585
真有意思  别再玩你自己的尾巴了
Very funny. Stop playing with your tail.

116
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:37,869
凯特  怎么无精打采的  
Kate, you're slouching.

117
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,459
这才对嘛
Thank you, honey.

118
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:40,590
你知道你看起来有多强壮和美丽吗
Do you see how strong and beautiful you are?

119
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:45,001
我的...
My...

120
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:48,302
任何食物都是恩赐  孩子
Any food is a blessing, dear.

121
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:52,350
温斯顿  过来和我们一起吃饭
Winston? Come join us for dinner?

122
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,041
速度
Now!

123
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,545
谢谢  亲爱的
Thank you, honey.

124
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:02,144
菜羹冷炙和骨头怎么能叫饭呢
Scraps and bones is no kind of dinner.

125
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:04,145
在我这里不行
Not for my pack.

126
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,136
对不起  父亲
I'm sorry, Dad.

127
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:09,189
那些东部狼群打乱了阵脚
It's just those Eastern Wolves.

128
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:11,553
不怪你  凯特
It's not your fault, Kate.

129
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:13,735
当他们闯入我们地盘时
When they crossed into our territory,

130
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:16,261
他们就破坏了群落守则
they broke pack law.

131
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:17,427
温斯顿
Winston.

132
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:26,235
小能被一群东部狼袭击了
Can-do was jumped by a group of Eastern Wolves.

133
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:27,939
这没什么大不了的
It ain't nothing.

134
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,916
快点  把他带进洞里来
Quickly, bring him into the den.

135
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:37,418
温斯顿  亲爱的  无论这是谁干的
Winston, honey, whoever did this,

136
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,823
我们都要让他好看
Let's rip his tail off and shove it down his throat.

137
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:45,190
老大  我们难道就要这样放任
Sir, are we just going to

138
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:46,973
他们破坏我们的捕猎吗
let them keep raiding our hunts

139
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,099
并且...
and...

140
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:51,298
让我们阿尔法族进入戒备状态
Put our Alphas on alert.

141
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:52,869
已经办好了  老大
Already done, sir.

142
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,103
好样的
Good job.

143
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:06,517
伙计们  说实话  驯鹿肉也没那么好吃
Guys, honestly, caribou is overrated.

144
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:09,142
相反现在应该想开点
Instead, now, keep an open mind,

145
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:11,622
我只希望你们也能接受其他的食物
I just want you to have an open mind here,

146
00:12:11,691 --> 00:12:14,888
我们给你们带了蓝莓来
we bring you berries.

147
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:21,526
那松鼠怎么样呢
How about squirrels?

148
00:12:24,837 --> 00:12:26,099
开玩笑的
Bad joke.

149
00:12:26,172 --> 00:12:27,696
松鼠飞了
Flying squirrels.

150
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,032
温斯顿
Winston!

151
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,933
托尼  你看起来气色真好
Tony! You're looking good.

152
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,272
我后背僵得像块木头  椎间盘也裂开了
My back feels like wood. I got this disk that keeps cracking.

153
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:13,916
我都快被折磨疯了
Drives me crazy.

154
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:18,286
是啊  托尼  你就是只疯狂的狼
Yeah, Tony, you are one crazy wolf.

155
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:20,152
-是吗  -是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

156
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:23,552
就像你在我们捕猎过程中玩的跟踪把戏
Like that little game of tag during our hunt.

157
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:26,020
游戏还是让欧米加们去玩吧
Let's leave the playing to the Omegas.

158
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:29,059
你知道东部已经没有驯鹿可捕了
You know there's no caribou left in the east.

159
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:30,397
那是你的问题
You got a problem.

160
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:35,236
部群联盟  温斯顿  是你当初提议
Unite the packs, Winston. It was you who gave the big speech

161
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:37,256
让你女儿凯特和我儿子卡斯
that your daughter Kate and my son Garth

162
00:13:37,257 --> 00:13:40,506
联姻以团结部群的
would marry and unite the packs.

163
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:46,911
卡斯知道他的使命  凯特知道吗
Garth knows his responsibility. Does Kate?

164
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:53,015
别担心  她知道的
Don't worry. She knows.

165
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:54,989
那就好
Good.

166
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,690
那她今晚可以在月圆狼嗥时跟卡斯见面
Then she can meet Garth tonight at the moonlight howl.

167
00:14:03,536 --> 00:14:06,699
我不会让我的部群挨饿的  温斯顿
I won't let my pack starve, Winston.

168
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:10,774
非不得已之时  我们就爪牙相见吧
If we have to, we'll fight for the valley.

169
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:14,738
那肯定是个严重的错误
That would be a big mistake.

170
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:18,475
凯特  这个...
Kate. It's...

171
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,981
没关系  爸爸  我懂
It's okay, Dad. I understand.

172
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:23,853
这是...这是我的责任
It's... it's my responsibility.

173
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,858
伙伴们  我们得为月圆狼嚎做准备了
Guys, we got to get ready for the moonlight howl.

174
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:39,029
伙计们  有美眉哦
Guys, girls.

175
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:40,727
美眉啊
Girls?

176
00:14:58,157 --> 00:15:00,421
你们很拉风啊
You are cool.

177
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,721
这样  让我打头阵...
So, let me go ahead...

178
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:07,629
让美眉们准备迎接你们  我们到时候见
prepare the girls for your arrival and you guys meet me there.

179
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,962
好戏要开始啦
Game on.

180
00:15:09,735 --> 00:15:11,134
美眉
Girls.

181
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:23,509
凯特  你看着美极了
Kate, you look so beautiful.

182
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:26,847
如果卡斯越界了
Now, if Garth gets out of line,

183
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,513
就用你那美丽的獠牙
take those beautiful teeth of yours,

184
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:33,989
朝着他喉咙咬下去直到他一动不动为止
go for the throat, and don't let go until the body stops shaking.

185
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:41,733
如果我的小公主不想这么做
If my little girl doesn't want to do this,

186
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:43,659
如果她还没准备好...
if she's not ready...

187
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:47,069
放心  爸爸  我准备好了
Don't worry, Dad. I'm ready.

188
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:50,436
莉莉  快点
Come on, Lilly.

189
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:51,874
好了  好了
Okay. Okay.

190
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:50,493
你的皮毛看起来好极了
Your fur... it looks fantastic tonight.

191
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:52,469
-哦  上帝啊  -我得...
- Oh, my Gosh. - I had...

192
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:53,629
欧米加注意了
Omega alert.

193
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:58,504
我来搞定这个
I will handle this.

194
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:00,545
皮毛顺滑无比
It totally relaxes the knots.

195
00:17:00,612 --> 00:17:01,670
你好
Hey.

196
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:04,707
你好
Hey.

197
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:08,517
我只有那一招
That's all I've got.

198
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:15,459
哇  一笑倾城啊
Wow. This is a new feeling.

199
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:17,392
伙计们  我全看见了
I saw the whole thing, guys.

200
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:21,923
我不敢相信她们竟然不睬你们
And, I cannot believe they didn't just fall all over you.

201
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:25,801
你说"你好"的时候我觉得你把握十足呢
When you yelled, ''Hey,'' I thought you cinched it right there.

202
00:17:26,105 --> 00:17:29,199
你觉得你比我更有能耐吗
So, you think you can do better?

203
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:30,673
拜托
Please.

204
00:17:30,743 --> 00:17:33,803
下个走上山坡的女孩  就是我的了
The next girl that comes up the hill, she's mine.

205
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:42,143
我从未见过如此美丽的她
I've never seen her look that good.

206
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:45,586
凯特真是漂亮极了
Kate is hot.

207
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,432
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

208
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,601
站住
Hey.

209
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:08,179
你觉得你要去哪儿啊
Where do you think you're going?

210
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:10,306
汉弗莱  你知道规矩的
Humphrey, you know the rules.

211
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,215
你是不能和她共嗥的  她是阿尔法
You're not allowed to howl with her. She's an Alpha.

212
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:14,650
我们可以一起吃东西
We can eat together.

213
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,417
但我们不能  你知道  共嗥
But we can't, you know, howl together.

214
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,118
伙计们  我知道  我...我就是...
Guys, I know. I... I was just...

215
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:24,123
开玩笑
kidding.

216
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:30,364
别在意  兄弟  你还有我们呢
Cheer up, buddy. You still got us.

217
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:32,836
我们可是一辈子的朋友
Friends for life!

218
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,672
糟了
Ugly.

219
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,339
那你见过卡斯了吗
So, do you see Garth?

220
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:44,871
这下好了
Great.

221
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:47,550
我连他长什么样子都不知道
I'm not even sure what he looks like.

222
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:48,817
但我确信...
But I'm sure...

223
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:53,719
我们一眼就能认出他
we'll know him when we see him.

224
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,783
你好  凯特
Hey, Kate.

225
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:58,857
什么嘛
What?

226
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,597
卡斯
Garth.

227
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:05,795
莉莉  别碍事
Lilly, stand up.

228
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:10,067
卡斯  你好  很高兴见到你
Garth, hello. Good to see you.

229
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,006
-汉弗莱  -我的屁股  我的屁股
- Humphrey? - My butt! My butt.

230
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,103
真的很疼
It really hurts.

231
00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:17,443
你真该治治你的咳嗽了
You should really do something about that cough.

232
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:20,110
小心  凯特  事情有些奇怪
Be careful, Kate. There's something going around.

233
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:22,483
尾巴和耳朵一日不如一日  真的
Tails and ears are falling off, literally.

234
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,283
我叫汉弗莱
Name's Humphrey.

235
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,618
卡斯
Garth.

236
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:30,821
哇  你很...你很大块头啊
Wow. You are a...you are a big one, aren't you?

237
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:33,160
你简直就是头驼鹿啊
Wow. You're practically a moose.

238
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:34,290
你把你的鹿角藏哪儿了
Where you hiding them antlers?

239
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:35,765
这小不点儿是谁
Who's the coyote?

240
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:37,785
小不点儿是谁?  我懂了
Who's the coyote? I get it.

241
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:39,466
很好  因为我是...
That's good, 'cause I'm, like...

242
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:41,165
一个无关紧要的人
No one important.

243
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,751
莉莉  你为何不带着小不点儿
Lilly, why don't you take little coyote

244
00:19:43,752 --> 00:19:45,599
汉弗莱一边儿玩去呢
Humphrey and run along?

245
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,975
走吧  汉弗莱
Come on, Humphrey.

246
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:57,078
我们一起吃醋去吧
Let's go eat some of those bitter berries.

247
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:08,522
跟我说说你自己吧
So, tell me about yourself.

248
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:11,902
卡斯都喜欢干些什么呢
What does Garth like to do?

249
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,498
我很喜欢健身  你知道吗
Well, I'm really into fitness, you know?

250
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:21,073
短跑  伏地挺身
Rabbit sprints, tree squats.

251
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:30,688
你知道我们阿尔法必须保持身材来领导部群
You know us Alphas got to keep fit to lead the pack.

252
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,052
但真正让我着迷的是...
But, what really gets me going is...

253
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:01,343
你觉得怎么样啊
Was it good for you?

254
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:04,155
不可置信
Unbelievable.

255
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:08,620
你知道...
You know...

256
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:10,353
我只是...
I just...just...

257
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:13,597
稍等一下  我马上回来
Hold on a sec 'cause I'm going to be right back.

258
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:16,267
我需要喝点水  喝点水
I... I need some water. Some water.

259
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:18,796
好吧  我马上...就稍等一会
Okay? So, I'll... just... hold on.

260
00:21:25,277 --> 00:21:30,277
没关系  我就继续练练嗓子吧
No worries. I'll just keep my vocal chords warm.

261
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,811
好极了
Yeah.

262
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:36,248
"他是个无关紧要的人"
"Oh, he's no one important".

263
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:38,915
"带着小不点儿汉弗莱一边玩去"
"Just take little coyote Humphrey and run along."

264
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:40,721
小不点儿
Coyote.

265
00:21:55,173 --> 00:21:57,198
-小白脸呢  -他叫卡斯
- Where's Barf? - It's Garth.

266
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,903
我们中场休息一下
And we're just taking a little break.

267
00:21:59,144 --> 00:22:00,270
休息一下吗
A break?

268
00:22:00,345 --> 00:22:01,937
怎么啦  很奇怪吗
What? Is that so strange?

269
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:04,642
不不不  你开什么玩笑
No. No, no, no, no. Are you kidding?

270
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:08,447
我总喜欢狼嚎间休息个十分钟
I always like to take a break 10 minutes into a howl.

271
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,249
我的确要休息一下
Well, I do.

272
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:14,782
你的狼嚎伙伴  他不是...  身大无脑
Your howling partner, he's not a...he's not a stud.

273
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,626
不是身大无脑  虽很像"身大无脑"
Not a stud but, like, it's like "stud"

274
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:21,189
但...是个无用鬼  无用鬼  是吧
but...a dud. A dud. That's it. Isn't he?

275
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:24,629
不是
No.

276
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,962
他不是无用鬼
He is not a dud.

277
00:22:27,572 --> 00:22:32,305
实际上  汉弗莱  你会很惊奇地
In fact, Humphrey, you'd be surprised

278
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:36,937
发现他很...强壮
to find that he is...strong!

279
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:41,146
没错  没错  强壮  他很...
Yes. Yes! Strong! And he's... He's...

280
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:44,714
-骄傲  -对  对
-Proud! -Yes! Yes.

281
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:48,254
骄傲  他很...那词怎么说来着
Proud. And he's... What's the word I'm looking for?

282
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,424
是阿尔法中的阿尔法
An Alpha's Alpha.

283
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:55,429
对  他是阿尔法中的阿尔法
That is right! He is an Alpha's Alpha.

284
00:22:58,337 --> 00:22:59,634
你真让我生气
You make me so mad!

285
00:23:01,073 --> 00:23:02,597
嘿  我刚才开玩笑的
Hey, I was just kidding.

286
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:08,938
你很可爱
You're kind of cute.

287
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:13,214
真的吗  你认为...哇  我  可爱
Really? You think... So, wow. Okay. Cute. Yeah.

288
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:17,221
那个...听着  首先  谢谢夸奖
That's...look...Thank you, first of all,

289
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:19,195
可是你指的"可爱"是
but do you mean "Cute" in,

290
00:23:19,196 --> 00:23:22,192
有点硬汉的  帅帅的"可爱"吗
like, a rugged, kind of handsomely ''Cute''?

291
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,849
屁股上又来一下  
Again with the butt.

292
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,059
这些蚊子真是无法无天
These mosquitoes are out of control.

293
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:31,533
我们火星上见
I'll meet you on Mars,

294
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:36,400
就在我喝下银河系后
right after I eat the Milky Way.

295
00:23:36,475 --> 00:23:38,636
听起来不错
That sounds good.

296
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:45,949
留一些给我
Save some for me.

297
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:53,820
把他们装起来  我们去爱德华州
Bag them up, boys. We're going to Idaho.

298
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:55,257
遵命  头儿
You got it, chief.

299
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:58,228
好  就这样  小心那里
Okay. There we go. Watch out there.

300
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:11,267
凯特?
Kate?

301
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:39,989
多谢参观贾斯珀国家公园

302
00:24:59,591 --> 00:25:00,751
我在哪儿
Where am I?

303
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:05,162
汉弗莱吗
Humphrey?

304
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,754
是你吗
Is that you?

305
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:08,561
凯特  我们这是在哪儿
Kate! Where are we?

306
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,900
我不知道
I don't know.

307
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,197
我们可能已经死了
Maybe we're dead.

308
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:16,239
没有  绝对没死
Nope. Definitely not dead.

309
00:25:16,942 --> 00:25:19,843
最起码他们有水让我们喝
At least they left us some water.

310
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:21,208
你有水喝吗
You got water?

311
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,914
不对  绝对不是水
Nope. Definitely not water.

312
00:25:25,217 --> 00:25:27,913
凯特  你在干嘛呢
Kate, what are you doing?

313
00:25:29,788 --> 00:25:30,948
试着逃出去
Trying to get out.

314
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:35,150
冷静一下
Calm down.

315
00:25:35,227 --> 00:25:36,754
听着  他们可能要把我们送去
Listen, maybe they're taking us to

316
00:25:36,755 --> 00:25:37,627
食物更充足的地方
where there's more food.

317
00:25:37,696 --> 00:25:39,459
又或者我们就是食物
Or maybe we are the food.

318
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:44,333
有道理  反抗  反抗
Kate, you're right. Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight.

319
00:25:49,908 --> 00:25:51,000
好了
Yeah.

320
00:25:53,778 --> 00:25:55,939
可以了  放他们出来吧
All right. Set them free.

321
00:26:00,652 --> 00:26:02,085
看他们跑的
Look at them go.

322
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:15,655
哇
Wow.

323
00:26:16,902 --> 00:26:18,563
这里不是贾斯珀公园
This isn't Jasper.

324
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:22,905
但这里实在是帅呆了
Yeah, but it sure does... Rock!

325
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,102
快点  趴下
Quick, get down!

326
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:30,576
他们在干嘛呢
What are they doing?

327
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:34,510
这将是多么令人沸腾的时刻啊
What a smashingly brilliant story this is.

328
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:36,470
来自北极圈的小鹅
The golfing goose from the low

329
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:39,223
积分正遥遥领先
regions of the Arctic Circle is leading the pack.

330
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,759
他用错球杆了
He's using the wrong club.

331
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:49,207
能帮个忙吗  小刺们
Could you do me a favor, Needles,

332
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,135
请闭上你们说话的洞
and shut the hole that makes the words.

333
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:57,140
看起来  它们在玩某种诡异的游戏
Looks like they're playing some sort of weird game.

334
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,369
或许他们知道能让我们回家的路
Maybe they can tell us how to get home.

335
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:00,947
好主意  如果他们不知道的话
Yeah. And if they can't,

336
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:01,605
我们就吃了他们
we can eat them.

337
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,477
没错  跟我走
Yeah. Follow my lead.

338
00:27:19,497 --> 00:27:21,192
我就在你身后
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

339
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:37,003
这杆是我的了
Now you will see, this shot is mine.

340
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:46,051
帅呆了  漂亮一击
Splendid! Wonderful hit, sir.

341
00:27:57,602 --> 00:27:58,626
马上就好
Just a minute!

342
00:28:13,018 --> 00:28:15,145
过程纠结了点  不过跑得不错
It's ugly, but a good runner.

343
00:28:26,898 --> 00:28:28,388
你看见了吗  看见了吗
Did you see that? Did you see that?

344
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:31,194
这鸟毁了你的小鸟球
I guess the birdie ruined your Birdie.

345
00:28:31,736 --> 00:28:33,670
你说了小鸟球  说明你承认球进洞了
You mark it ''Birdie'' because it would have gone in.

346
00:28:33,738 --> 00:28:36,400
理论上来说  是可能会进
Technically, sir, it might have gone in.

347
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:39,136
我的球被那只蠢鸟给毁了
That silly bird stopped my shot from going in.

348
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,838
所以  就不应该再记杆了
So, I will not take an extra stroke.

349
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:43,505
快记下  是小鸟球
Mark it Birdie!

350
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:45,344
那  那算是个障碍物
Well, it... it was an obstacle.

351
00:28:48,753 --> 00:28:51,688
不管谁打  都得有障碍物
And everyone has to play with the obstacles.

352
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:54,621
再说了  我们不能打假球
You know, we wouldn't want to lie.

353
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:57,423
如果你是法国人的话这压根不算假球
This is not a lie. This is not a lie if you are French.

354
00:28:57,495 --> 00:29:00,372
法裔加拿大人
Well, French-Canadian. There's a slash,

355
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:02,364
不能算是法国人
a hyphen, in between there.

356
00:29:03,435 --> 00:29:05,027
-我就认为是法国人  -加拿大人
- I say French. - Canadian.

357
00:29:05,103 --> 00:29:06,502
-法国  -加拿大
- French. - Canadian.

358
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:07,799
-法国  -加拿大  先生
- French! - Canadian, sir.

359
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:10,864
不管怎么说  您都是个厉害的高尔夫球员
May I just say, though, that you are a wonderful golfer.

360
00:29:12,911 --> 00:29:17,007
你也是个非常好的球童
And you are a very good caddie.

361
00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:19,743
快跑
Take off!

362
00:29:19,818 --> 00:29:21,115
帕蒂  你怎么了
Paddy, what is wrong with you?

363
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,821
你  你们好
Hello.

364
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,553
你们是  两只狼
You are two wolves.

365
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:32,187
虽然我在这还没怎么见过狼
I have not seen many wolves in these parts.

366
00:29:32,263 --> 00:29:34,891
但是我不怕  不怕
But I am not afraid of wolves. No.

367
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:36,558
我爱狼
I Iike wolves.

368
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:41,299
好极了  我们就想问几个问题
Good. 'Cause we just want to ask you a few questions.

369
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:44,432
没问题  快看身后
Yes. Quick! Look behind you!

370
00:29:46,845 --> 00:29:48,107
抓住他
Grab him!

371
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,651
你是想尝尝法国式的反抗吗
So, you want to face the French Resistance?

372
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,346
是法裔加拿大式
That's French-Canadian!

373
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,746
我的屁股  屁股  屁股
My butt! My butt! My butt!

374
00:29:59,557 --> 00:30:00,546
这是个有出息的欧米加
Omegas.

375
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,453
这已经不能算是游戏了
This is not a game anymore!

376
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:06,296
你难道不洗脚的吗
Don't you wash your feet?

377
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:08,089
小心树杈
Look out for the trees!

378
00:30:09,868 --> 00:30:11,233
小心
Watch that.

379
00:30:11,302 --> 00:30:12,360
真漂亮  先生
Nice one, sir.

380
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:14,530
抓住你啦
Gotcha.

381
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,664
不
Oh, no.

382
00:30:20,211 --> 00:30:21,439
这样会很痛的
That's got to hurt.

383
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:24,277
感觉如何  小蠢狼
How do you like it now, wolf?

384
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,644
一杆即中  先生
Hole in one, sir.

385
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:34,925
兄弟  我可不是那么容易对付的
You have bit of more than you can chew this time, my friend.

386
00:30:34,993 --> 00:30:36,358
救命
Help!

387
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:39,554
天哪  我得找个
My goodness. I... Look out for the...

388
00:30:40,865 --> 00:30:42,526
不  不  不  不
No. No. No. No. No. No.

389
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,363
他肯定完蛋了
He's a goner for sure.

390
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:53,542
等等  你们在看什么  看什么呢
Wait, what are you looking at? What are you looking at?

391
00:30:54,412 --> 00:30:55,743
弗兰克  见到你真好
Hey, Frank.

392
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,120
好吧  你有什么问题
Okay. You have a question?

393
00:31:11,196 --> 00:31:13,630
没错  我们现在在哪儿
Yeah. Where are we?

394
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,223
爱达荷
Idaho?

395
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,726
啥跟啥
Ida-who?

396
00:31:17,202 --> 00:31:21,070
爱达荷  一个有山  有河  有湖
Oui, Idaho, land of mountains, rivers, lakes,

397
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:24,066
还有很多很多土豆的地方
and a few billion potatoes.

398
00:31:24,142 --> 00:31:26,235
锯齿国家公园
Sawtooth National Wilderness.

399
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:28,142
爱达荷  我们在这里干嘛
What are we doing in Idaho?

400
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:32,873
你们被安排到这里来繁衍后代
You were relocated to repopulate.

401
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:41,858
他们希望你们大狼  能生一堆小狼
They want you big wolves to make a lot of little wolves.

402
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:45,723
听上去不错啊  公园里可不能少了狼
Sounds good to me. Park shouldn't be without some wolves.

403
00:31:45,797 --> 00:31:48,493
我的意思是  对公园来说  挺好的
I mean, only for the good of the park.

404
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:52,195
所以  你们是非法同居对吧
So you two are undomesticated partners?

405
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,830
帕蒂  好好说话
Paddy, please. Don't be rude.

406
00:31:54,906 --> 00:31:58,808
你们是男女朋友吧
So, you two are boyfriend, girlfriend?

407
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,539
你们合二为一了吗
You are an item?

408
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:04,977
-这个  -没有
- Well... - No.

409
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,449
你们这些狼  可真有趣
You wolves, you are funny.

410
00:32:10,688 --> 00:32:12,622
我们必须马上回家
We have to get home now.

411
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,181
我不回去的话贾斯珀会有大麻烦的
There's going to be trouble if I don't get back to Jasper.

412
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,728
好吧  好吧  你有点神经质了
Right. All right. You're freaking out.

413
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:20,889
我没发疯  只是我不得不回去
I'm not freaking out. I just have to get home.

414
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:23,695
-是因为那小白脸吗  -他叫卡斯
- Is this about Barf? - It's Garth.

415
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:25,419
再说了这是关乎责任的问题
And it's about responsibilities.

416
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,329
我也不指望你能懂
So, I don't expect you to understand.

417
00:32:28,673 --> 00:32:29,901
能请你帮个忙吗
Can you help me?

418
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:31,441
我需要马上回家
I need to get home fast.

419
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,941
好吧  速速小姐
All right, Miss Fast.

420
00:32:34,612 --> 00:32:36,637
你温馨的家在哪儿
Where is home sweet home?

421
00:32:37,815 --> 00:32:39,442
加拿大的贾斯珀公园
Jasper Park, Canada.

422
00:32:39,517 --> 00:32:42,062
贾斯珀公园  开玩笑啊  
Jasper park? Get out of here.

423
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:44,216
我们最喜欢贾斯珀公园了
We love Jasper Park!

424
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:46,883
没错  没错  我们去那儿旅游好多次了
Yes, yes. We've toured it many times.

425
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:50,052
拜托  帕蒂  我们去那旅游很多次了
Paddy, please. We've toured it many times.

426
00:32:50,495 --> 00:32:52,759
我和一只从那儿过来的尖嘴鸭约会过一次
I dated a pintail from Jasper once.

427
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,357
她一直呱呱地叫个不停  我都要疯了
She never stopped quacking. Drove me nuts.

428
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:58,334
你受不了的话正好给我
Drove her right to me.

429
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:00,466
注定的  注定的
Bound to happen. Bound to happen.

430
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:03,369
那你能帮我回家了
So, you can help me, then, get home.

431
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:06,130
我们好久没上贾斯珀那儿玩了
We haven't played Jasper in quite a while.

432
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:08,435
听上去会是个不错的主意
I think it would be a smashing idea.

433
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:13,384
确实如此  我会帮助你们的
This is true. So, of course I will help.

434
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:15,419
我喜欢你俩  你们是我的开心果
I like you two. You make me laugh.

435
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:17,861
再说了  我还欠你们一个人情
And you didn't eat me,

436
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:18,749
因为你们没有吃我
so I owe you favor.

437
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:28,925
她去哪儿了
Where did she go?

438
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,797
那正是我要问的问题
Maybe I should ask you.

439
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:32,768
你知道这不是我的风格
You know that's not my style.

440
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:35,598
我的部下  小能  了解你的风格
My wolf, Can-do, knows your style.

441
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:40,670
我就想说一件事
I just want to say one thing.

442
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:44,340
如果你的手下胆敢伤害我女儿
If any of you wolves have hurt my daughter,

443
00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:46,841
我会亲自挖出你的眼睛
I will personally rip out

444
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:50,820
塞进你的喉咙
your eyes and shove them down your throat

445
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:54,483
让你亲眼看到我是如何撕裂你的身体的
so you can see my claws tear your carcass open!

446
00:33:57,996 --> 00:33:58,985
妈妈
Mom?

447
00:33:59,063 --> 00:34:01,861
宝贝  妈妈在怒火中  一会儿再说
Not now, dear. Mommy's in a rage.

448
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:05,500
既然凯特放了卡斯飞机
Well, since Kate stood up Garth,

449
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,765
我可以在她回来之前带卡斯到处看看
I could show him around until she gets back.

450
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:10,465
我不会说她放了我飞机
I wouldn't say ''Stood up.''

451
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:12,133
卡斯
Garth!

452
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,268
听起来不错
Sounds good to me.

453
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:14,572
那来吧  卡斯
Well, come on, Garth.

454
00:34:20,985 --> 00:34:25,081
很温柔吧  从我这儿继承的
Isn't that sweet? She gets it from me.

455
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:30,283
满月是最后时限
I'll give her till the full moon.

456
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,230
今天天气特别好
It is beautiful out there.

457
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:45,468
都有去田地里挖土豆的冲动了
Almost makes you want to hit the potato patch.

458
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:48,808
如果你还没出门的话就快行动吧
If you haven't already hit the outdoors, get on out your door.

459
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,313
今天的天气是...
The weather today is...

460
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:52,542
你们回家的车
Your ride home.

461
00:34:52,617 --> 00:34:53,982
快  进去
Quick! Get in!

462
00:34:56,687 --> 00:35:00,109
搞什么  一天被关在箱子里两回
What? Boxed up twice in one day.

463
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,317
什么倒霉运啊
What are the odds?

464
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,756
-躲起来  -快
- Hide! - Hide!

465
00:35:06,097 --> 00:35:09,498
那是斯卡蔻丝夫妇
That right there is Garn and Debbie Theocarcus.

466
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:11,337
你们运气不错
Lucky for you, they travel

467
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:14,197
他们每年都会先去锯齿再去贾斯珀
every year to Jasper right after Sawtooth.

468
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:18,766
天气真好  老婆大人气色也非常不错
The day's looking pretty, and so is my woman.

469
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:25,545
这是那首让我们相遇的歌
This is the song we met to.

470
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:27,914
来  亲爱的  我们来跳舞吧
Come here, you. Let's dance.

471
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:30,979
-钻进来  -快
- Down here. - Hurry.

472
00:35:32,323 --> 00:35:37,323
他曾经摩托车队的  她是图书管理员
Now, he was in a motorcycle gang, and she was a librarian.

473
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,897
所谓异性相吸
And opposites attract, if you will.

474
00:35:39,964 --> 00:35:43,297
没错  不过这次是因为书店也贩卖啤酒
Exactly. In this case, it was a bookstore that also sold beer.

475
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:44,391
他们就这么相遇了
So, they met.

476
00:35:48,406 --> 00:35:49,873
快  我们得进车里了
Come on. We have to get in.

477
00:35:58,616 --> 00:35:59,844
棒极了
All right. Here we go.

478
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,456
你就是我的白马王子
You're just a dream.

479
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:19,031
我跳起来像个小兔子  对吧  亲爱的
I'm like a little bunny. Aren't I, dear?

480
00:36:26,511 --> 00:36:28,103
我爱你  黛比
I love you, Deb.

481
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:30,638
我也爱你
I love you, too.

482
00:36:38,122 --> 00:36:40,352
快进去  快
Get inside now. Get inside. Quick.

483
00:36:40,424 --> 00:36:43,018
哎  又要回箱子里了
Well, back in a box.

484
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:49,698
你俩一路顺风
Good luck, you two!

485
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:52,361
我们会在天上照看你们的
We will be watching out for you from above!

486
00:36:52,436 --> 00:36:54,368
好吧  我会看着你们的
Well, I'll be watching out for you.

487
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:55,496
他会在一旁喘气
He will be breathing heavily.

488
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,487
如果无从选择  我们会为了溪谷而战斗
If we have to, we'll fight for the valley.

489
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:25,326
汉弗莱
Humphrey?

490
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,805
为什么要叫兔粑粑山
So, why is this called Rabbit Poo Mountain?

491
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:08,373
因为兔子爱在这个地方拉屎
Because this is where rabbits like to poo.

492
00:38:11,816 --> 00:38:13,078
开个玩笑啦
I was just kidding.

493
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:16,083
我懂了  你是负责搞笑的欧米加
I get it. You're a funny Omega.

494
00:38:18,322 --> 00:38:20,313
好吧  快逗我笑
Okay. Make me laugh.

495
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:27,728
我是谁
What am I?

496
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:32,529
这难到我了
You got me.

497
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:35,094
是个翻不过身来的海龟
It's a turtle that fell and can't get up.

498
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:36,670
挺像的
That's pretty good.

499
00:38:36,741 --> 00:38:38,902
那这又是什么呢
Okay. What's this?

500
00:38:41,212 --> 00:38:43,112
是个在路上被压死的海龟
It's turtle road kill.

501
00:38:44,749 --> 00:38:46,546
你还能扮什么
What else can you do?

502
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:48,084
我只会扮海龟
I just do turtles.

503
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:49,642
好了  该到我了
Okay, it's my turn.

504
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,210
你想看看阿尔法会做什么吗
You want to see something an Alpha can do?

505
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:54,584
我妈会同意吗
Would my mother approve?

506
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:56,024
当然
Of course.

507
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:57,685
那好吧
Well, okay then.

508
00:39:12,777 --> 00:39:16,235
继续找  我们必须在明天晚上之前找到她
Keep searching. We must find her before tomorrow night.

509
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:36,030
温斯顿
Winston?

510
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,304
别担心  伊夫
Don't worry, Eve.

511
00:39:41,372 --> 00:39:44,205
她是我训练过得最好的阿尔法
She's the finest Alpha I've trained.

512
00:39:44,275 --> 00:39:45,936
我没担心  温斯顿
I'm not, Winston.

513
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,002
她也是我训练过得最好的阿尔法
She's also the finest Alpha I've ever trained.

514
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:08,463
车停了
We stopped.

515
00:40:20,177 --> 00:40:22,077
-你怎么了  -我要小解
- What's wrong with you? - I have to go.

516
00:40:22,146 --> 00:40:24,637
你不能离开  就不能多忍一下吗
You can't leave. Can't you hold it?

517
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:25,704
不  我做不到
No! I can't.

518
00:40:26,183 --> 00:40:27,946
好吧  试过盘腿了吗
Well, did you try crossing your legs?

519
00:40:28,018 --> 00:40:29,349
-试过了  -那屏住呼吸呢
-Yes! - Holding your breath?

520
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,149
试过了  我屏得差点要晕过去了
Yes! I almost passed out.

521
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:34,623
-闭上眼睛  -里面还是外面  我不行了
- Closing your eyes and... - In or out, I am going.

522
00:40:37,161 --> 00:40:38,389
你就不能快点吗
Would you hurry?

523
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:40,760
我有压力的时候解不出来
I can't go when I feel pressured.

524
00:40:40,831 --> 00:40:41,855
速度啊
Go!

525
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:07,386
他到底在干吗
What is he doing?

526
00:41:09,126 --> 00:41:11,651
这包装居然是防狼的
The packaging's wolf-proof.

527
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:26,441
他跑哪儿去了
Where is he?

528
00:41:28,078 --> 00:41:29,636
快过来  汉弗莱
Come on, Humphrey.

529
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:51,726
有恶狼
It's a rabid wolf!

530
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:53,235
马克斯  把枪拿出来
Max, bring that gun!

531
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,706
我送你一程  恶狼  有遗言吗
This is it for you, wolf. Any last wishes?

532
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,887
马克斯  他们跑了
Max, they're getting away!

533
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:15,255
有我在  他们跑不了
Not if I can help it.

534
00:42:15,893 --> 00:42:17,121
-不  -我们被困住了
- No! - We're trapped.

535
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:20,753
逮着你俩了
I got you both now.

536
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:22,162
快打他们
Shoot them!

537
00:42:27,271 --> 00:42:29,068
打得真"好"啊  马克斯
Nicely done, Max.

538
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:59,901
好吧  我饿昏了头
Okay. Thinking with my belly instead of my head,

539
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,783
我现在知道那不是个好主意
not a good idea. I get it.

540
00:43:01,784 --> 00:43:03,337
我建议咱可以弄个舒服的窝
I say we build a comfy den...

541
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:05,773
-我要回家  -好吧
- I'm going home. - Great.

542
00:43:05,843 --> 00:43:08,243
我知道你要回家  可这在下雨啊
You're going home, and it's raining.

543
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:10,506
我不会停下来的
I'm not stopping.

544
00:43:11,248 --> 00:43:13,443
雨啊  雨啊  快停吧
Rain, rain, go away.

545
00:43:13,517 --> 00:43:15,382
快停吧  雨啊  没人希望你下
Get out of here, rain no one wants you around

546
00:43:15,452 --> 00:43:16,680
你在搞什么
What are you doing?

547
00:43:16,754 --> 00:43:19,222
这  这是求雨舞  为了让雨停下来的舞
It's... It's a rain dance, to stop it from raining.

548
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:22,755
因为你太湿了  毁了我们的一天
'Cause you're wet and you really are going to ruin our day

549
00:43:22,826 --> 00:43:25,317
汉弗莱  求雨舞是求下雨的
Humphrey, rain dances make it rain.

550
00:43:29,433 --> 00:43:33,392
好吧  那我反着跳
Right! Well, I'll just do it backwards.

551
00:43:39,777 --> 00:43:40,903
真有效果唉
That actually worked.

552
00:43:49,353 --> 00:43:50,445
凯特
Kate?

553
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,848
哎  估计那不是什么好点子
That's not a good idea.

554
00:43:56,594 --> 00:43:58,186
等等我  凯特
Hold on, Kate!

555
00:44:25,623 --> 00:44:26,612
不
No!

556
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:29,650
坚持住  凯特  我来了
Hold on, Kate! I'm coming!

557
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,891
让我想想  想想
Let me think. Let me think.

558
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:42,567
汉弗莱
Humphrey!

559
00:44:47,411 --> 00:44:49,641
别怕  凯特  刚那是计划的一部分
Don't worry, Kate. It's all part of my plan.

560
00:44:49,713 --> 00:44:51,078
我看出来了
I can see that.

561
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,977
凯特  凯特  抓住我的尾巴
Kate. Kate! Grab my tail.

562
00:44:55,052 --> 00:44:56,417
抓住你什么
Grab your what?

563
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:59,320
用你那阿尔法的嘴咬住...
Take those Alpha jaws and grab...

564
00:45:00,591 --> 00:45:02,149
我的尾巴啊  尾巴
My tail. My tail.

565
00:45:04,762 --> 00:45:07,629
凯特  摆起来  转圈摆
Kate, wiggle. Wiggle around.

566
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:13,494
好痒啊  我的尾巴好痛
That tickles. My tail hurts!

567
00:45:16,507 --> 00:45:18,236
谁会知道我那儿怕痒呢
Who knew I was ticklish there?

568
00:45:18,308 --> 00:45:20,071
我坚持不住了
I can't take any more.

569
00:45:30,254 --> 00:45:31,448
不
No.

570
00:45:32,322 --> 00:45:34,586
天哪  汉弗莱  汉弗莱
My gosh. Humphrey! Humphrey!

571
00:45:38,562 --> 00:45:41,497
你的尾巴  天哪  都是我的错
Your tail. I'm so sorry.

572
00:45:41,565 --> 00:45:43,362
我的尾巴还在
My tail's actually fine,

573
00:45:44,968 --> 00:45:46,731
我已经检查过啦
last time I checked.

574
00:45:53,177 --> 00:45:55,805
来吧  我们找个地方躲雨吧
Come on. Let's get out of the rain.

575
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:57,278
好吧
Okay.

576
00:46:00,584 --> 00:46:01,915
谢谢你
Thank you.

577
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,230
头  我们已经搜寻完整个领地了
Sir, we've searched the entire territory.

578
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,935
还是没有发现凯特的踪影
Still no sign of Kate.

579
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,468
头
Sir?

580
00:46:28,045 --> 00:46:30,912
我们必须保卫我们的领地
We must defend our territory.

581
00:46:54,404 --> 00:46:55,666
球来啦
Fore!

582
00:46:58,075 --> 00:47:01,340
看  看  看  这里都发生什么了
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

583
00:47:01,411 --> 00:47:03,606
好像来的不是时候哦
I say, we've caught them at quite the bad time.

584
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,739
不对  我们来的正是时候
No, I'd say we caught them at a good time.

585
00:47:05,816 --> 00:47:07,511
确实如此  先生
Indeed, sir. Indeed.

586
00:47:07,985 --> 00:47:09,418
你俩在这儿干吗
What are you doing here?

587
00:47:09,486 --> 00:47:12,580
问题应该是  你俩在这儿干吗
No, the question is what are you doing here?

588
00:47:12,656 --> 00:47:15,420
我可是给了你俩  头等舱的票子啊
I give you a first class ticket home...

589
00:47:15,492 --> 00:47:17,050
可是直达的唉
It's a straight shot right to the pin.

590
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:18,617
-你们却不坐了吗  -是的
- And you blow it? - Yep.

591
00:47:19,696 --> 00:47:21,163
就为了个杯形蛋糕
Over a cupcake.

592
00:47:21,832 --> 00:47:23,891
真荒谬  "杯形蛋糕"
Ridiculous dessert. ''A cupcake.''

593
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:25,400
事实上  它们的确挺好吃的
Actually, they're quite delicious.

594
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:28,560
肯定有其他去贾斯珀的办法
There has to be another way for us to get to Jasper.

595
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:31,631
其他办法  其他办法吗
Another way? Another way?

596
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,609
其他办法  当我是旅游代理啊
Always another way. What am I, a travel agent?

597
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:36,806
别这样  你在耍我吗
Come on. What, are you kidding me?

598
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,036
一个像你这样成功的运动员
A great sportsman like yourself

599
00:47:38,037 --> 00:47:40,611
总知道很多赢得比赛的方法
always knows a few ways to win the game.

600
00:47:40,684 --> 00:47:43,676
或许可以乘火车
Well, there could be a train.

601
00:47:43,754 --> 00:47:46,348
事实上  确实有趟火车  叫做加拿大特快
Actually, there is a train. It's the Canadian Express and...

602
00:47:46,423 --> 00:47:48,891
拜托  帕蒂  那叫加拿大特快
Paddy, please. It's called the Canadian Express...

603
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:50,756
没错  直达贾斯珀公园
Yes, and it shoots right by Jasper Park.

604
00:47:50,828 --> 00:47:52,955
直达贾斯珀公园
Right by Jasper Park.

605
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,725
-如果能赶上的话  -马上就能到家了
- If you can catch it... - You'll be home in no time.

606
00:47:54,798 --> 00:47:56,026
马上  非常快
No time. Very fast.

607
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:58,397
太棒了  我们在哪儿上车呢
Great. So where do we board?

608
00:47:58,468 --> 00:48:00,436
在哪儿上车呢
Where do you board?

609
00:48:00,504 --> 00:48:01,869
看这个
Watch this.

610
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,141
在山的另外一边
On the other side of that mountain.

611
00:48:08,212 --> 00:48:09,645
拜托  帕蒂
Paddy, please.

612
00:48:09,713 --> 00:48:11,180
我们走吧
Come on!

613
00:48:11,248 --> 00:48:13,745
是我没管好嘴巴  但能再容许我说句
Let it slip, but may I say,

614
00:48:13,746 --> 00:48:15,150
刚刚那球真是棒极了
that was a stupendous shot.

615
00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:17,847
批准了  那球真的很棒  不是吗
You may, and it was pretty good, wasn't it?

616
00:48:17,921 --> 00:48:19,616
确实  先生
Indeed, sir. Indeed.

617
00:48:37,474 --> 00:48:39,704
两人份晚餐
Dinner for two.

618
00:48:40,377 --> 00:48:43,039
这是我在盯梢猎物时新学会的动作
It's a new move I've been working on for stalking prey.

619
00:48:43,614 --> 00:48:44,911
帅呆了
You're good.

620
00:48:44,982 --> 00:48:47,917
谢谢  该你了
Thanks. Now you try.

621
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:50,218
不  我
No. I...

622
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,215
我不太会捕猎
I'm not much of a hunter.

623
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:54,416
来吧  你会做得很好的
Come on. You'll do great.

624
00:48:54,858 --> 00:48:56,519
就跟着我做
Just do what I do.

625
00:48:57,594 --> 00:48:58,618
好吧
Okay.

626
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,054
预备
Ready?

627
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:03,833
-一  -一
- One. - One.

628
00:49:03,901 --> 00:49:05,698
-二  -二
- Two. - Two.

629
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:07,168
三
Three!

630
00:49:13,443 --> 00:49:14,705
莉莉
Lilly!

631
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:21,847
莉莉
Lilly?

632
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:27,687
是个海龟  没错吧
A turtle, right?

633
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:30,756
我都告诉过你了  我不会捕猎
I told you, I don't hunt.

634
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:38,192
也许这样可以帮你
Maybe this will help.

635
00:49:41,738 --> 00:49:43,000
哇哦
Wow.

636
00:49:43,073 --> 00:49:44,802
"哇哦"什么
''Wow'' what?

637
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:47,709
你的眼睛好漂亮
Your eyes. They're beautiful.

638
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:53,109
来吧  咱再试一次
Come on. Let's try again.

639
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:01,954
-这儿真美  -是啊
- It sure is pretty out there. - Yeah.

640
00:50:03,827 --> 00:50:06,091
-来比比谁先跑到山顶吧  -接受挑战
- I'll race you to the top. - You're on.

641
00:50:07,497 --> 00:50:10,591
认输吧  汉弗莱  你永远也追不上我的
Give it up, Humphrey! You'll never beat me.

642
00:50:15,272 --> 00:50:16,466
汉弗莱
Humphrey?

643
00:50:21,111 --> 00:50:23,409
欧米加胜一分  阿尔法零分
Omega one, Alpha zero!

644
00:50:26,516 --> 00:50:27,847
好了  好了
Okay! Okay!

645
00:50:27,918 --> 00:50:29,407
够了够了  停下快停下  
Enough, enough! Stop! Stop!

646
00:50:29,408 --> 00:50:31,012
我知道了  知道了  知道了
I get it. I get it. I get it.

647
00:50:31,555 --> 00:50:33,580
作为一个女生  我投的怎么样啊
How's that for a girl's throw?

648
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:34,919
很有意思
Very funny.

649
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:39,454
看看你玩的多开心呀
Well, look who's having fun.

650
00:50:41,131 --> 00:50:43,827
你知道  我应该去看看火车什么时候来
You know, I should go check on the train.

651
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,992
等等  等等  等等  
Wait, wait, wait!

652
00:50:44,993 --> 00:50:45,629
等等我  等等
Wait, wait.

653
00:50:46,937 --> 00:50:48,370
嗨  你好啊
Hi, there.

654
00:50:48,438 --> 00:50:50,531
你是什么呀
What are you?

655
00:50:50,607 --> 00:50:52,438
好吧  我是匹狼
Well, I'm a wolf.

656
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:56,240
我从没见过狼  你长得真奇怪
I've never seen a wolf. You are really strange.

657
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,046
我真的很奇怪吗
Am I now?

658
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:01,349
你长得太奇怪啦
You're totally weird.

659
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:06,822
我要抓住你
I'm going to get you!

660
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,191
好了  小心  小心
No. Look out! Look out!

661
00:51:18,935 --> 00:51:20,562
好吧  你自找的啊
Okay, you asked for it.

662
00:51:24,908 --> 00:51:29,572
不哭不哭不哭  没事的  没事的
No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.

663
00:51:30,347 --> 00:51:31,837
我很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

664
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,551
不是吧
Oh, poo.

665
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,020
疯...
Mad...

666
00:51:45,695 --> 00:51:46,684
疯熊
Mad bear.

667
00:51:46,797 --> 00:51:50,460
凯特  准备好雪球  疯熊来袭
Kate! Get the snowballs ready! Mad bear on the attack!

668
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:59,097
加拿大特快  汉弗莱  火车来了
The Canadian Express! Humphrey, the train is coming!

669
00:51:59,176 --> 00:52:00,575
凯特
Kate!

670
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:02,309
汉弗莱
Humphrey?

671
00:52:05,615 --> 00:52:06,741
你怎么啦
What's wrong with you?

672
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:08,573
看那儿
That!

673
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:15,221
别动  我们可以对付
Don't move. We can handle this.

674
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:16,281
真的吗
We can?

675
00:52:19,696 --> 00:52:21,027
好吧  我们有麻烦了
Okay, we're in trouble.

676
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:25,626
伙计们  你们喜欢听笑话吗  很好
Guys. You guys like jokes? Good.

677
00:52:25,702 --> 00:52:28,604
那听着  两只熊正在吃一个笨蛋
So, okay. So two bears are eating a clown,

678
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:30,401
其中一只熊说
and one of the bears says,

679
00:52:30,474 --> 00:52:32,772
"你不觉得这个味道很怪吗"
"Does this taste funny to you?"

680
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:40,644
你说句"切"就行了啊
A simple "boo" would have sufficed.

681
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:42,941
老天啊
Man.

682
00:52:58,768 --> 00:53:01,100
看招  再来  再来
Watch this. One more. One more.

683
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:05,665
起来  凯特  快起来
Get up. Kate, get up.

684
00:53:10,247 --> 00:53:11,863
他俩上哪儿去啦  
Where are those two?

685
00:53:11,864 --> 00:53:14,377
他俩怎么总把事情搞得这么复杂呢
Why must they make this so difficult?

686
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:15,903
用"难伺候的一对"来形容
I believe the term is

687
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,113
最贴切不过了  先生
"high maintenance couple", sir.

688
00:53:27,063 --> 00:53:29,531
前有利爪后有悬崖  这可不妙啊
Stuck between the cliffs and the claws. This isn't good.

689
00:53:37,707 --> 00:53:39,698
真希望你能用开玩笑摆脱这个困境
Good luck joking your way out of this one.

690
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,836
你叫什么  先生
What's your name, sir?

691
00:53:43,313 --> 00:53:44,746
你叫咆哮  好吧
Growl. All right.

692
00:53:51,421 --> 00:53:52,615
你想要拥抱一下吗
Do you need a hug?

693
00:53:54,925 --> 00:53:56,893
我们为什么不谈谈呢  我们谈谈好吗
Why don't we talk? Can we just talk?

694
00:54:00,764 --> 00:54:02,095
真是愉快的谈话
Good talk!

695
00:54:34,331 --> 00:54:35,559
嗨  要我载你一程吗
Hey, need a ride?

696
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,093
跳过来  相信我
Jump! Trust me!

697
00:54:42,973 --> 00:54:44,634
我说吧  你可以相信我的

701
00:55:13,136 --> 00:55:16,264
难以置信  他俩竟然错过火车了
Unbelievable. They have missed the train.

702
00:55:22,746 --> 00:55:24,077
看来没有

703
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:49,766
我知道  不是很好听  对吧  
I know. It's not very good, is it?

704
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:50,331
好吧
Well...

从这儿嚎叫出来

汉弗莱

724
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:05,508
你在干嘛呢
what are you doing?

725
00:57:05,582 --> 00:57:07,500
抱歉  只是这月亮
I'm sorry. The moon,

726
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:09,245
此时此刻  我只是想

731
00:59:08,938 --> 00:59:10,997
但没人知道啊
But no one has to know.

732
00:59:11,074 --> 00:59:13,907
求你了  现在快离开

00:59:26,589 --> 00:59:28,557
-我只是...  -和其他人一起去

737
00:59:29,158 --> 00:59:30,318
发生什么事情了
What's going on?

738

Just do it. She howled at the moon with you.

743
01:00:11,034 --> 01:00:12,433
那纯粹是个偶然
That was just the moment.

744
01:00:12,902 --> 01:00:15,268
你好呀  毛茸茸的朋友
Bonjour, my furry friend.

745

746
01:00:21,844 --> 01:00:22,868
你们疯了吗
Are you guys crazy?

747
01:00:22,946 --> 01:00:24,208
这可要讨论决定
That's up for debate.

748
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:28,182
那位年轻的女士呢

749
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:29,548
她在睡觉  小声点

遵命  小声点

751
01:00:43,533 --> 01:00:44,898
你们这些家伙上这儿来干嘛
What are you guys doing here?

752
01:00:44,968 --> 01:00:48,369
确保你们没有忘记行驶路线
Making sure that you don't forget the run of the course.

753
01:00:48,438 --> 01:00:51,498

你女朋友睡觉的时候真漂亮

759
01:01:02,785 --> 01:01:04,218
她不是我的女朋友
She's not my girlfriend.

760
01:01:06,856 --> 01:01:09,086
那你可得好好努力了

我也不想把事情变成这样
I didn't want it to come to this.

764
01:01:45,728 --> 01:01:46,854
但结果还是这样了

你先请
Please, you first.

780
01:02:54,664 --> 01:02:56,655
汉弗莱  我想告诉你
Humphrey, I just wanted to tell you,

781
01:02:56,733 --> 01:03:01,733
过去的这些天  挺有趣的
these past couple of days, they've been, kind of, fun.

782
01:03:03,339 --> 01:03:06,365
你也是挺有趣的
You've been, kind of, fun.

783
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:08,504
真的吗

784
01:03:09,512 --> 01:03:10,877

789
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,271
不  不  不
No, no, no.

790
01:03:25,272 --> 01:03:27,287
不要告诉我你又要上厕所了
Don't tell me. You have to go to the bathroom again.

791
01:03:27,363 --> 01:03:29,092
为什么  你看到辆卡车停下来了吗
Why, do you see a truck stop?

792
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:34,532
我就是想告诉你  我...  我...

01:03:50,052 --> 01:03:54,716
我要求的只是遵照传统  联合部落
All I asked was for you to follow our customs, unite the packs.

797
01:03:55,057 --> 01:03:58,993
但是相反  你女儿却逃跑了
But, no. Your daughter had to up and run away.

798
01:03:59,061 --> 01:04:00,221
我没有逃跑
I didn't run away.

799
01:04:03,633 --> 01:04:04,793
凯特
Kate!

800
01:04:04,867 --> 01:04:06,266
她回来了
She's back!

801

你去爱达荷州干什么
What were you doing in Idaho?

804
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:26,349
我们被人类带到了另外一个公园
We were taken by humans to another park.

805
01:04:26,422 --> 01:04:28,947
我们本应该去繁殖后代的
We were supposed to repopulate.

806
01:04:32,628 --> 01:04:35,597
不不不  妈妈  我们没有繁殖后代
No, no, no. Mom. We didn't repopulate.

807
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:38,190
实际上还是汉弗莱帮我回家的
Humphrey actually helped me get home.

808
01:04:43,239 --> 01:04:44,900
真是个好男孩

01:04:59,422 --> 01:05:01,185
还有联合部落
And unite the packs!

812
01:05:14,003 --> 01:05:16,597
对部落好  让肚子饱
Good for the pack, good for the belly.

813
01:05:37,293 --> 01:05:40,524
结婚吗  你要结婚了吗
Marry? You're getting married?

814
01:05:41,197 --> 01:05:44,132
是的  这不是很好吗
Yes. Isn't it great?

815
01:05:44,934 --> 01:05:47,065
捕食时不会再有争斗了
No more fighting during hunts.

816

晚餐时不用再吃骨头肉屑了

欢迎回来  汉弗莱

把她带回家  真是好样的
Good job bringing her home.

820
01:06:27,209 --> 01:06:30,508
好多人啊
Wow. It's a big crowd.

821
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,348
是啊  好日子嘛
Yeah. Good times.

822
01:06:33,983 --> 01:06:36,952
我听说你和卡斯相处了一段时间
So I heard you and Garth spent some time together.

823
01:06:38,054 --> 01:06:39,146
莉莉
Lilly.

824
01:06:39,221 --> 01:06:40,245

825
01:06:40,323 --> 01:06:42,655
我想他肯定是个结婚的好对象

是啊  如果你喜欢高大
Well, if you like that sort of thing, big,

827
01:06:49,162 --> 01:06:51,623
强壮  完美型的
brawny, and perfect.

828
01:06:54,036 --> 01:06:55,901
莉莉  你把毛向后梳了
Lilly, you're wearing your fur back.

829
01:06:56,739 --> 01:06:59,173
抱歉  我知道了
Sorry. I know.

830
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:03,635
但是我很喜欢啊
But, I liked it.

831
01:07:06,248 --> 01:07:07,875
正中旗杆
Right on the pin.

832
01:07:08,584 --> 01:07:10,108
马塞尔  帕蒂
Marcel! Paddy!

833
01:07:10,586 --> 01:07:11,691
当拥抱的时候
When it comes to hugs,

834
01:07:11,692 --> 01:07:14,317
我们都成了法国人  对吧  帕蒂
we are all French, Paddy?

835
01:07:14,423 --> 01:07:16,891
好吧  我是英国人  所以我们不拥抱
Well, I'm English, so we don't hug!

836
01:07:17,693 --> 01:07:20,161
但头一次  我要说这个拥抱很不错
But for a first, I'd say that was a good one.

837
01:07:20,229 --> 01:07:22,288
见到你俩我真是太开心了
I'm so happy to see you two.

838
01:07:22,365 --> 01:07:24,299
我们飞过来确认你们到家了
We flew in to see that you made it home.

839
01:07:24,367 --> 01:07:26,130
然后我们发现了什么
And what do we find?

840
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:30,536
-你要结婚了  -你要结婚了
- You're getting married! - You're getting married!

841
01:07:32,441 --> 01:07:35,035
是啊  我要结婚了
Yeah. I'm getting married.

842
01:07:35,111 --> 01:07:36,908
-谁告诉你们的  -我
- Who told you? - I did.

843
01:07:38,381 --> 01:07:39,848
汉弗莱
Humphrey.

844
01:07:40,349 --> 01:07:42,249
我们应该走了
We should be going.

845
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:43,580
是的  是的
Yes, yes.

846
01:07:49,025 --> 01:07:51,493
不好意思  一只跳蚤
Excuse me. A flea.

847
01:07:52,661 --> 01:07:55,095
还有给你婚礼的一点小心意
And a little something for your big day.

848
01:07:56,198 --> 01:07:57,597
谢谢
Thank you.

849
01:07:57,666 --> 01:07:59,099
只是想来跟你道别
Just wanted to say good-bye.

850
01:07:59,368 --> 01:08:00,699
道别
Good-bye?

851
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:03,068
是啊  我想出去旅行一下
Yeah. I'm thinking about doing a little traveling,

852
01:08:03,139 --> 01:08:05,232
你知道  看看火车会把我带到哪儿
you know, seeing where the train takes me.

853
01:08:06,175 --> 01:08:07,802
也许我还会去拜访我们的狗熊朋友
And maybe I'll visit our friends the bears.

854
01:08:09,178 --> 01:08:10,941
老伙计们  看看他们过得怎么样
Our old buddies, see how they're doing.

855
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,080
我会向他们转达你的问候
I'll tell them you said hi.

856
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:17,447
等等  你要离开贾斯珀了吗
Wait. But you're leaving Jasper?

857
01:08:18,054 --> 01:08:21,649
是的  你知道  孤独的狼都这样嘛
Yeah. You know, it's a lone wolf thing.

858
01:08:23,259 --> 01:08:26,422
我了解的汉弗莱  是个风趣的欧米加
I know Humphrey, the fun-loving Omega,

859
01:08:27,129 --> 01:08:29,927
而不是一匹孤独的狼
not Humphrey, the lone wolf.

860
01:08:30,466 --> 01:08:32,866
那我就是匹风趣的孤独的狼
So I'll be a fun-loving lone wolf.

861
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:40,603
我知道的
I don't doubt that.

862
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:46,142
你知道吗  马塞尔  我一向坚守传统
You know, Marcel, I am a stickler for tradition,

863
01:08:46,215 --> 01:08:48,809
但是这个我就不能理解了
but this one, I just don't understand.

864
01:08:49,785 --> 01:08:52,948
这些狼啊  可真难理解
These wolves are mysterious creatures.

865
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:10,099
托尼
Tony.

866
01:09:10,906 --> 01:09:11,998
那么...
So...

867
01:09:14,577 --> 01:09:16,067
你准备好了吗
Are you ready?

868
01:09:16,879 --> 01:09:17,937
是的
Yes.

869
01:09:18,614 --> 01:09:19,706
很好
Good.

870
01:09:21,917 --> 01:09:23,384
你还好吗
Are you okay?

871
01:09:24,653 --> 01:09:25,950
当然
You bet.

872
01:09:26,021 --> 01:09:27,886
我这边可没问题
No problems on this end.

873
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:30,118
准备好开始开始开始啦
Ready to go, go, go.

874
01:09:33,996 --> 01:09:36,021
那么你希望谁先开始
So, you want to start this thing or me?

875
01:09:36,098 --> 01:09:37,360
我们一起开始
We'll start together.

876
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:39,733
一起开始  好啊
Start together. Yeah.

877
01:09:39,802 --> 01:09:42,464
怎么啦
So, what's happening?

878
01:09:42,938 --> 01:09:45,236
他们在相互嗅对方的气味
They're accepting each other's scent.

879
01:09:47,009 --> 01:09:49,375
现在  轻轻的互咬耳朵
And now, the nibble on the ears.

880
01:09:52,948 --> 01:09:54,540
你们觉得我能做到吗
Do you think I can make it?

881
01:09:54,617 --> 01:09:57,056
当然  先生  你顺着轨道跑
Yes, sir, and just as you hit the tracks,

882
01:09:57,057 --> 01:09:59,020
你会看到一截开着的火车车厢
you should see an open train car.

883
01:09:59,088 --> 01:10:01,265
小心卡车停靠  熊
Well, avoid truck stops, bears,

884
01:10:01,266 --> 01:10:04,355
还有那个可怕的甜点  叫什么来着
and that hideous dessert. What is it called?

885
01:10:04,426 --> 01:10:06,894
-杯形蛋糕  先生  -是的  杯形蛋糕
- Cupcakes, sir. - Yes. Cupcakes.

886
01:10:06,962 --> 01:10:09,157
我会注意的  多谢  伙计们
I will. Thanks, guys.

887
01:10:09,999 --> 01:10:12,297
你知道吗  你不该对杯形蛋糕那么苛刻
You know, you shouldn't be so judgmental about cupcakes.

888
01:10:12,368 --> 01:10:13,892
它们真的很美味
They really are quite delicious.

889
01:10:13,969 --> 01:10:15,561
再好吃又如何
I wouldn't know.

890
01:10:17,173 --> 01:10:22,003
最后  他们要相互摩擦鼻子
And finally, they will rub noses

891
01:10:22,004 --> 01:10:24,902
那就代表他们是夫妻了
to symbolize that they are mates!

892
01:10:42,798 --> 01:10:44,356
凯特  你怎么啦
Kate, what are you doing?

893
01:10:45,167 --> 01:10:46,225
我...
I...

894
01:10:49,138 --> 01:10:51,072
我做不到
I can't.

895
01:10:51,507 --> 01:10:52,838
你做不到吗
You can't!

896
01:10:54,777 --> 01:10:56,768
我的意思是  你做不到
I mean, you can't?

897
01:10:57,346 --> 01:10:58,970
这是怎么回事  温斯顿
What is this, Winston?

898
01:10:58,971 --> 01:11:00,213
她为什么不能嫁给卡斯
Why can't she marry Garth?

899
01:11:00,282 --> 01:11:01,442
安静点
Quiet.

900
01:11:03,118 --> 01:11:05,382
凯特  凯特  你为什么不能嫁给卡斯
Kate, Kate. Why can't you marry Garth?

901
01:11:06,055 --> 01:11:07,784
因为我...
Because I...

902
01:11:09,692 --> 01:11:13,184
因为我爱上了一个欧米加
I fell in love with an Omega.

903
01:11:13,629 --> 01:11:14,960
一个欧米加吗
An Omega?

904
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:19,595
汉弗莱吗  那个狡猾的家伙
Humphrey? That sly dog!

905
01:11:33,716 --> 01:11:37,413
阿尔法爱上欧米加  那可是违反部落规定的
An Alpha in love with an Omega. That's against pack law.

906
01:11:37,486 --> 01:11:38,748
爸爸
Dad.

907
01:11:39,688 --> 01:11:42,657
我也爱上了一个欧米加
I also am in love with an Omega.

908
01:11:43,959 --> 01:11:45,051
什么
What?

909
01:11:46,729 --> 01:11:49,755
你都对我儿子做了些什么  温斯顿
What have you done to my son, Winston?

910
01:11:49,832 --> 01:11:52,630
欧米加和阿尔法  阿尔法和欧米加
An Omega and an Alpha? An Alpha and an Omega?

911
01:11:52,701 --> 01:11:54,862
伊夫  帮帮我
Eve, help me out.

912
01:11:59,174 --> 01:12:03,110
真是太疯狂了  这可不符合传统
This is madness. This isn't our custom.

913
01:12:03,178 --> 01:12:07,012
我们可不会这么做  占领山谷
This isn't our way. Take the valley!

914
01:12:16,358 --> 01:12:18,258
我最喜欢婚礼了
I just love weddings!

915
01:12:35,177 --> 01:12:37,839
鹿群大狂奔  鹿群大狂奔
Stampede! Stampede!

916
01:12:37,913 --> 01:12:40,746
大家快跑  快跑
Everyone, run! Run!

917
01:12:40,816 --> 01:12:43,011
到山谷的两边去
To the sides of the valley!

918
01:12:51,994 --> 01:12:54,758
我背上那块该死的骨头又僵了
It's that darn disk in my back.

919
01:12:56,298 --> 01:12:57,595
快跑
Come on!

920
01:13:07,209 --> 01:13:09,200
不好  他们被困住了
No! They're trapped!

921
01:13:17,319 --> 01:13:18,445
汉弗莱
Humphrey!

922
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,544
凯特
Kate!

923
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:20,815
我们必须去帮他们
We have to help them!

924
01:13:22,658 --> 01:13:23,750
快看
Look!

925
01:13:31,233 --> 01:13:32,825
跑快点  托尼  再快点
Faster, Tony! Faster!

926
01:13:45,881 --> 01:13:47,143
向左
Go left!

927
01:13:49,084 --> 01:13:50,608
右翻转
Roll right!

928
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:54,545
你学得真快啊
You're getting good at this.

929
01:13:54,623 --> 01:13:56,056
名师出高徒嘛
I had a good teacher.

930
01:13:58,594 --> 01:14:01,154
离他们太远了  我们赶不到的
They're too far ahead. We'll never make it.

931
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:02,527
抓紧了
Hold on.

932
01:14:10,639 --> 01:14:11,628
看
Look!

933
01:14:22,351 --> 01:14:24,012
世界探险者
World adventurers.

934
01:14:24,086 --> 01:14:25,747
我说过我们是很好的组合嘛
I told you we'd make a good team.

935
01:14:25,821 --> 01:14:28,016
你说的吗  我记得是我说的
Did you say that? I thought I said that.

936
01:14:33,028 --> 01:14:34,120
凯特
Kate!

937
01:14:58,253 --> 01:14:59,948
凯特  凯特
Kate. Kate.

938
01:15:04,293 --> 01:15:05,692
求你了  凯特
Please, Kate.

939
01:15:07,796 --> 01:15:09,457
求你了  你不能这么做
Please, you can't do this.

940
01:15:20,742 --> 01:15:22,107
我爱你
I love you.

941
01:16:14,263 --> 01:16:15,355
凯特
Kate!

942
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:20,963
汉弗莱
Humphrey?

943
01:16:21,803 --> 01:16:22,895
我还以为我失去你了
I thought I'd lost you.

944
01:16:31,213 --> 01:16:32,703
大家都在看着我们吗
Is everyone staring at us?

945
01:16:32,948 --> 01:16:35,483
好吧  没有  没有  不是所有人
Well, no, not... Not every...

946
01:16:35,484 --> 01:16:37,351
好吧  是的  现在都在看了
Well, yeah. Now they are.

947
01:16:38,453 --> 01:16:41,286
见鬼  因为有些事我要告诉你
Darn. 'Cause I wanted to tell you something.

948
01:16:45,527 --> 01:16:46,619
什么
What?

949
01:16:48,964 --> 01:16:50,090
真的吗
Really?

950
01:16:52,034 --> 01:16:55,526
好吧  我也有些事要告诉你
Okay. Well, I wanted to tell you something, too.

951
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:07,510
也许这并没有什么问题
Maybe this can work.

952
01:17:13,021 --> 01:17:14,511
好吧
All right.

953
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:15,750
卡斯
Garth!

954
01:17:26,735 --> 01:17:29,055
托尼  你说我们两匹老狼
Tony, what do two old wolves do

955
01:17:29,056 --> 01:17:30,603
退休了后能干什么
after they retire?

956
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:35,706
先生们  请允许我给你们介绍高尔夫
Gentlemen, may I introduce you to golf?

957
01:17:39,982 --> 01:17:40,971
球来了
Fore!

958
01:17:55,664 --> 01:17:56,653
真不错
Oh, that's good.

959
01:18:06,642 --> 01:18:09,304
来吧  宝贝  让我们给他们做个示范
Come on, honey. Let's show 'em how it's done.

960
01:18:09,378 --> 01:18:11,141
准备好摇摆尾巴了吗
You ready to shake your tail?

961
01:18:19,354 --> 01:18:20,844
那嚎叫真是美妙动听极了
Now that's a howl.

962
01:18:38,073 --> 01:18:39,131
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

963
01:18:39,207 --> 01:18:40,606
当然准备好了
Oh. Ready.
