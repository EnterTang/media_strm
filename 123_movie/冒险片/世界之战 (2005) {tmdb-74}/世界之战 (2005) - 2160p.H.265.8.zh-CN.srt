1
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,779
Is the lightning back?

2
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:03,282
No, this is something else.

3
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,554
- What's that sound?
- I've never heard that before!

4
00:01:25,763 --> 00:01:27,139
Is it them? Is it them?

5
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:30,226
We gotta go.

6
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:32,186
Where do we go?!
Robbie, this is your house.

7
00:01:32,394 --> 00:01:33,479
Where do we go?!

8
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,492
No, no, no, wait!

9
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:08,055
Are we still alive?

10
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,501
Down here.

11
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:08,716
Were you on this plane?

12
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:12,178
Are you--?
Are you a passenger?

13
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:22,021
How you doing?
Wanna help me open this?

14
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,317
Are you a passenger?

15
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:28,152
He's deaf.

16
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,989
The shell went off right beside him.
Camera on his shoulder saved his life.

17
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:33,532
You hear that, Max?

18
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,327
Your stupid camera
saved your stupid life.

19
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:38,996
Where were you?

20
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:41,457
Out there in the Pine Barrens.

21
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,168
We were attached to
a National Guard unit.

22
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:45,753
The 83rd Mechanized.

23
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:47,921
They moved on one of those things
around midnight.

24
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,923
They got some kind of shield
around them.

25
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:52,843
You can't see it, but everything we fire
at them detonates too early,

26
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:55,846
before we can get close enough
to cause any damage.

27
00:04:56,388 --> 00:05:00,142
When they flash that thing,
everything lights up like Hiroshima.

28
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:03,020
There's more than one?

29
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:06,064
You gotta be kidding me, right?

30
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,359
We were feeding New York,
but New York went dark.

31
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:11,904
So we patched over to D.C.,
they went down.

32
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,823
L.A., Chicago, uplinked to London.

33
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:18,160
Even called the affiliates to try
to get them to catch the feed,

34
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,996
but nobody answers.
It's the same everywhere.

35
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:25,626
Once the Tripods start to move,
no more news comes out of that area.

36
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:37,971
My God.

37
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:40,932
You ain't seen nothing yet.

38
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:47,147
I saw that storm. I was right
in the middle of one of those.

39
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:48,815
Well, you didn't see it like this.

40
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:51,401
Those machines come up
from under the ground, right?

41
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,487
So that means they must've been
buried here a long time ago.

42
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:58,783
So who's driving the goddamn things?
Watch the lightning.

43
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,660
Watch it.

44
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:03,246
Watch the lightning.

45
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:05,623
Keep watching the lightning.

46
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:11,588
What is that?

47
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:15,925
That is them.
They come down in capsules,

48
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:19,053
riding the lightning into the ground,
into the machines, right?

49
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:23,933
You hear that?

50
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:26,519
We're getting the hell out of here.

51
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:31,691
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

52
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:36,362
Hey, were you on that plane?

53
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:41,451
That's too bad.
It would've been a really great story.

54
00:06:43,494 --> 00:06:45,621
Look at me. Look at me.

55
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,957
You keep your eyes only on me,
understand?

56
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,084
- Okay.
- Don't look down. Don't look around.

57
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:53,796
I'm taking you to the car.
You're gonna wanna look around.

58
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:55,047
But you're not going to.

59
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,467
- Are you?
- No.

60
00:06:57,675 --> 00:07:01,053
You're doing good. You're doing good.
Keep your eyes on me.

61
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:02,430
I'm going right to Boston.

62
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:04,807
- We're gonna see your mom.
- I'm not gonna look, Dad.

63
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:07,018
That's a girl. That's my girl.
Now listen.

64
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,936
- I want you to close your eyes, okay?
- Okay.

65
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:11,480
Got them closed? There you go.

66
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:13,983
- Keep them closed for me.
- Okay.

67
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,406
Robbie, get in.

68
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,285
- Robbie, get in!
- Why are you yelling?

69
00:07:24,493 --> 00:07:26,078
It's okay.

70
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:29,915
Get in.

71
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:52,855
- Why aren't we on the turnpike?
- I don't want everybody

72
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:55,524
to see that we've got a working car.
We'll stay along the Hudson

73
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:59,028
till we find an open bridge or ferry,
then we're gonna cross the Hudson.

74
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:03,198
We'll take the back roads across
Connecticut, all the way to Boston.

75
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:06,410
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, running, hiding.

76
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:08,662
- In their basements.
- If we had balls, we'd go back

77
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:12,332
- and find one of those things and kill it.
- Right. Yeah, good.

78
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,501
Why don't you just let me
make the big decisions.

79
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,170
Which would be when? Never, Ray?

80
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:17,713
- Never's about your speed.
- Stop it.

81
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:19,840
Enough of the "Ray" shit. All right?

82
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:21,341
- It's "Dad," "sir,"
- Don't fight.

83
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,552
or if you want, "Mr. Ferrier."

84
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,014
That sounds a little weird to me,
but you decide.

85
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,517
- Dad?
- Yes, Rachel.

86
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:34,980
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

87
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,566
Really?

88
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:46,158
- I gotta go.
- Not so fast, not so fast, all right?

89
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:48,201
There's two things
we gotta watch out for.

90
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,829
And the second is people
who might want our car.

91
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:53,748
- There's nobody around.
- Yeah. I gotta go.

92
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:02,507
All right, Rachel?

93
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:04,175
Rachel, it's good right there.

94
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:06,553
I'm not going in front of you guys.

95
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:10,682
- Just go where I can see you.
- Are you crazy?

96
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,726
- Don't look!
- I'm not gonna look.

97
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:15,770
- Just stay in sight!
- That's looking!

98
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:19,983
Okay, well, listen, every time
you guys don't listen to me,

99
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:23,862
I'm telling your mother, okay?
I'm making a list.

100
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:26,781
Making a list.

101
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,659
- I told you to stay where I could see you.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

102
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:28,509
Stop! Stop!

103
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:30,511
Wait! Stop! Let me on!

104
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,347
Let me on! Give me a hand!

105
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:35,141
Wait! Stop!

106
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:38,144
- Stop! Give me a hand!
- Kid, you're gonna get run over!

107
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:41,188
- Give me a hand! You have room!
- Robbie!

108
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:44,275
- You wanna go in that direction?
- Stop! Stop!

109
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:47,528
There's nothing living
in that direction, Robbie.

110
00:10:47,736 --> 00:10:49,613
What do you care?
You never gave a shit before.

111
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:51,866
- You never gave a shit!
- Okay, hard-ass,

112
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:54,326
what's your plan, huh?
You're in charge now!

113
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,745
- Tell me what we're doing.
- Catch up with these soldiers!

114
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:59,915
Hook up with whoever else isn't dead,
and we get back at them.

115
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:03,460
We get back at them.
That's what we do.

116
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:07,840
Let's try one that doesn't involve your
10-year-old sister joining the Army.

117
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:10,551
- You have anything like that?
- Just tell us the truth.

118
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,886
- Wanna try that?
- You have no idea which way to go.

119
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:15,097
You wanna come off all wise and shit!

120
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:17,891
You only chose Boston
because you hope Mom is there.

121
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,352
And if she's there,
you can dump us on her.

122
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:24,022
You can dump us on her, then you'll
only have to care about yourself,

123
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:27,901
which is exactly the way you like it.

124
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:30,237
Robbie!

125
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:32,573
Where are you trying to go?

126
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:35,409
What are you trying to do?

127
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:39,204
Who's gonna take care of me
if you go?

128
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:59,891
This is a test of
the Emergency Alert System.

129
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:03,270
If this had been an actual emergency,
official messages

130
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:07,315
from federal, state or local authorities
would've followed the alert tone.

131
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:10,235
This concludes the test
of the Emergency Alert--

132
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:14,823
I'll close my eyes.
Why don't you drive for a bit.

133
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:17,951
I don't have a license.

134
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:21,413
Since when has that stopped you?

135
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:53,778
Ray.

136
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,447
Ray! Dad!

137
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,408
Ray! Dad!

138
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:03,121
You think you could--?

139
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:05,998
You think you could--?
Do you think you could--?

140
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:08,251
Don't stop.

141
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,503
Don't take your foot off. Okay?

142
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:13,256
I got it, but keep your foot on.
Okay, I got it. I got it.

143
00:13:13,464 --> 00:13:16,634
- Where is everybody going?
- I don't know, Rach.

144
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:18,803
But we do, right?

145
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,888
Yeah, we do.

146
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:34,360
Why did he do that?

147
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,531
- Why is he doing that?
- He wants a ride, Rach.

148
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:41,784
- Everybody just wants a ride.
- Can we give him one?

149
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:45,579
Sit back and put on your seat belt.
Robbie, put on your seat belt.

150
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:47,706
Put on your seat belt, Rachel.

151
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:52,795
- Be careful.
- How'd you fix this?

152
00:13:53,003 --> 00:13:56,507
- How'd you fix the car?
- Please! Why won't you help us?

153
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:00,219
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.

154
00:14:00,427 --> 00:14:01,887
Please, get away from the car.

155
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:04,139
Hey! Stop the car.

156
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:07,059
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

157
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:10,062
You could carry 20 people in there!

158
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,314
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

159
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:14,149
Stop the car!

160
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:20,197
Hold on.

161
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:21,406
Look out!

162
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:23,158
Watch out! Hold on!

163
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,335
Are you okay?

164
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:48,725
No, wait! Wait!

165
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:51,436
No! Just wait! Okay! Wait! Stop!

166
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:53,522
- Just stop!
- Daddy!

167
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,232
Rachel!

168
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,609
Get out of there!

169
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,779
Robbie!

170
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:09,996
Robbie!

171
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:12,624
- Ray!
- Get in the car!

172
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:20,340
- Help!
- Rachel! Get out of the car!

173
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:22,550
Rachel, get--
Get out of the car.

174
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,136
- Get out!
- Daddy!

175
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,646
- Take it easy!
- Get off the car!

176
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:36,231
Get off!

177
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:37,899
Get off the car! Move!

178
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:39,818
Move!

179
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,820
- Where's my son?
- You don't need that, man.

180
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:44,531
- Where's my son? Robbie!
- Cool down, man.

181
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:46,616
- Put the gun down, man.
- Robbie!

182
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:54,332
Dad!

183
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,835
Okay, now, listen.

184
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:01,005
- Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
- My daughter's in the car.

185
00:16:01,214 --> 00:16:03,174
- I'm taking the car, man.
- Please. All I want--

186
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:06,010
- Put down the goddamn gun!
- All I want is my daughter.

187
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:08,554
- I'm taking the car, man.
- Please, I just want my daughter.

188
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:10,723
Let me just take my daughter.
Can I--?

189
00:16:10,932 --> 00:16:14,018
- All I want is my daughter.
- Yeah. Okay, go ahead, man.

190
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:16,229
Robbie.

191
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:28,281
Take me with you!

192
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:31,594
Have you seen this girl?
This is my daughter.

193
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:33,638
He needs his medicine.

194
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:47,360
We've got it the worst,
that's what I heard.

195
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,488
The U.S., mostly.
South America and Asia, some.

196
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,323
There's nothing going on in Europe.

197
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:55,159
Europe got the worst of it,
that's what everybody's saying.

198
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:57,662
- Completely wiped out some of it.
- I don't give a shit who it is.

199
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,248
I got up close to one of those things
in Stanfordville.

200
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:02,083
If they're all over the place,
we're dead.

201
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,044
- Looks like the power's still on here.
- Yeah.

202
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:07,296
Yeah, power's still on.

203
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:10,633
Because nothing bad's come up
from the ground.

204
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:14,136
- Hold on. Hold on, move back!
- Watch out there, lady!

205
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:16,305
I said, move back!

206
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,928
Unless you are O-positive
and RH-negative,

207
00:18:56,136 --> 00:19:00,265
thank you very much, but we already
have more blood than we can use.

208
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:07,189
Again, if you are O-positive,
RH-negative, identify yourselves.

209
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,441
If you are not, thank you very much.

210
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,736
We already have more blood
than we can use for the transfusions.

211
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,738
Let's go, folks.

212
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:17,866
This way. This way.
Keep it moving.

213
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:22,079
Keep it moving. This way.
Let's go, folks. Keep it moving.

214
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:26,249
Please move forward calmly.
The boat can make more than one trip.

215
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:26,458
I

216
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:30,754
Please move forward calmly.
Take your time. Don't rush.

217
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,215
Ray! Ray! Ray!

218
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,759
- Sheryl?
- Yeah. Hey.

219
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,719
Oh, my gosh, is this your--?

220
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,096
- Are these your kids?
- Rachel.

221
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,807
Hi, I'm Sheryl.
This is my daughter, Nora.

222
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,226
- Nora. I've heard about you, Nora.
- Hi.

223
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,270
- This is my son, Robbie.
- Just like Dad.

224
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,580
- It's good to see you as well.
- Trees are funny.

225
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:09,918
We're gonna move a few cars out
of the way to make some more space.

226
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,088
You're gonna have to give us
a few minutes.

227
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:16,299
But don't worry,
there'll be plenty of room for everybody.

228
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,927
We got sick people here.
Let us on.

229
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,340
Cast off. Get that ramp up.

230
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,510
Cast off now. Get that ramp up.

231
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:01,886
Cast off.

232
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,014
No more people. No more people.
We're taking the ramp up.

233
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,876
Stay close. Stay close.

234
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,837
Everybody stop. Everybody stop.

235
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,548
- Wait, wait, wait. Just--
- Back up. Back up.

236
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:41,884
- There's room.
- Just stay back.

237
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,552
No more room.
There's no more room.

238
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,221
Just listen to me.
There's three of us.

239
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,681
- Five. There's only five of us.
- There's no room.

240
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,141
Okay, man, just don't push me.

241
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,602
- Sir, there's no more room.
- There's plenty of room.

242
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,063
- There's room for hundreds more.
- Sir--

243
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,397
- Everybody, wait.
- Hold on.

244
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:56,940
- You just stay with me.
- Okay.

245
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,150
Grab my jacket.

246
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,860
Everybody back up.

247
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,111
Back up.

248
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,738
I got you, Ferrier.

249
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,740
- Oh, Jesus.
- You okay?

250
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,949
- Yeah.
- Come on.

251
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,035
- Okay, Jesus. Oh, my God.
- Come on.

252
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,370
Watch out.

253
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,629
Come on.

254
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,757
Oh, Ray.

255
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,759
Ray!

256
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,428
Come on. Come on.

257
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,223
Go. I can go with him.

258
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,142
Sheryl?

259
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,519
Go with them. Go.

260
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,729
- Ray.
- Sheryl?

261
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,564
- Everybody--
- Sheryl?

262
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,567
- There's room on the boat.
- Let us through, goddamn it.

263
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,778
- There's still room on the boat.
- She's a child.

264
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,321
- Robbie.
- There's room on the--

265
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,741
There's still room on the boat.
There's room on the boat.

266
00:22:52,787 --> 00:22:54,456
- Robbie.
- Just stay with me.

267
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,625
Stay with me, Robbie.

268
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,922
Robbie!

269
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,240
- Robbie, Robbie.
- Robbie!

270
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,409
Robbie!

271
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:36,664
- Robbie.
- Come on.

272
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,751
Here. Grab my hand.

273
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:40,960
Here. Hold on.

274
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,005
I got you. Hold on.

275
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:46,007
Take my hand.

276
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:48,176
Take it. Take my hand.

277
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:49,761
Here!

278
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:12,617
Oh, my God.

279
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,470
Robbie!

280
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:18,765
Swim. Swim this way!

281
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:15,488
- Robbie, help me with her.
- Here, Rach.

282
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:20,785
Don't stop. Don't stop.

283
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:23,037
Don't stop.

284
00:26:39,846 --> 00:26:41,764
Oh, my God.

285
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:46,871
Robbie, slow down.

286
00:27:56,672 --> 00:27:58,090
Robbie, slow down.

287
00:28:12,146 --> 00:28:14,982
- Robbie.
- We gotta stay together, Robbie.

288
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:18,735
Robbie?

289
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:20,237
Stay together.

290
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:21,989
Robbie!

291
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:27,452
Get back here!

292
00:28:32,082 --> 00:28:33,458
Robbie!

293
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,544
No, Robbie!

294
00:28:35,752 --> 00:28:36,920
Come back!

295
00:28:44,243 --> 00:28:45,869
Robbie.

296
00:28:46,078 --> 00:28:47,871
Don't move. Don't move.

297
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,874
Now for God's sake, stay right here.
I'm coming right back.

298
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,043
- Robbie!
- Stop those people.

299
00:28:53,252 --> 00:28:55,212
- Turn around. Turn around.
- Robbie.

300
00:28:55,963 --> 00:28:57,297
Robbie.

301
00:28:57,506 --> 00:28:58,716
Robbie.

302
00:28:58,924 --> 00:29:00,092
What the hell?

303
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,344
Why are you doing this?

304
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:09,059
Pull back.
Five hundred meters to my 1 0 o'clock.

305
00:29:11,103 --> 00:29:13,272
Jekyll, no effect on target.
No effect.

306
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,523
Roger. No effect.

307
00:29:14,857 --> 00:29:17,609
Our mission, lieutenant,
is to delay their advance

308
00:29:17,818 --> 00:29:20,320
till those refugees get to safety.
Now, keep firing.

309
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:25,575
You've gotta listen. Turn around!
I want you to listen to me.

310
00:29:28,662 --> 00:29:29,663
Listen to me.

311
00:29:29,871 --> 00:29:31,415
Go back down the hill!

312
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:33,875
All of you, just turn around!

313
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:48,598
- Don't do this. I know you wanna fight.
- I wanna be here.

314
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:49,808
I need to see this.

315
00:29:50,016 --> 00:29:51,518
It seems like you have to,
but you don't.

316
00:29:51,726 --> 00:29:53,436
- Please, let me go.
- You don't.

317
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:55,730
Okay. Wait. Wait.

318
00:29:56,147 --> 00:29:57,857
What are you doing here
all by yourself?

319
00:29:58,066 --> 00:29:59,609
Sweetie, you gotta come with us,
please.

320
00:29:59,818 --> 00:30:01,778
No. My dad's getting my brother.
I have to stay here.

321
00:30:01,987 --> 00:30:03,113
- You can't stay here.
- Gotta go.

322
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:04,906
- I'm not gonna leave her alone.
- Leave.

323
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:06,950
I'm not letting you do this.
You can hate me.

324
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:08,326
- You can hate me.
- Let me go.

325
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:09,536
- But I love you.
- Please.

326
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:10,954
- I'm not letting you do this.
- Dad.

327
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:13,623
I can't. No. Please.
Please don't pull me.

328
00:30:13,832 --> 00:30:16,418
It's gonna be okay. You need
to come with us. It is not safe--

329
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:18,294
Please. I can't go with you.

330
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:19,921
- My dad's right there.
- Please, come.

331
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,881
- Please, my dad's right there.
- Listen to me--

332
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,634
I need to be here. I want to see this.

333
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:27,428
Wait. Wait-- Just stay for Rachel.
Stay for your sister.

334
00:30:27,637 --> 00:30:31,140
Please, let me go.
You need to let me go.

335
00:30:34,644 --> 00:30:35,645
All right. Okay. All right.

336
00:30:35,853 --> 00:30:37,105
- You're coming with us.
- Dad.

337
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:39,148
- We're going now.
- I can't.

338
00:30:39,357 --> 00:30:40,733
Dad!

339
00:30:44,696 --> 00:30:45,780
Dad.

340
00:30:47,156 --> 00:30:49,075
Dad!

341
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:56,999
Let me go! Dad!

342
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,294
Guide on. Guide on.

343
00:31:00,503 --> 00:31:02,505
Black Six. Attack. Attack. Attack.

344
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:06,509
Stop.

345
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:09,595
- That's my dad.
- I'm her father. I'm her father.

346
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:11,764
- We're so sorry.
- We thought she was alone.

347
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:15,393
- She was standing by the tree--
- She's fine. Let's go! Let's go!

348
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:19,939
Robbie.

349
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:32,576
Robbie!

350
00:31:50,803 --> 00:31:52,179
Over here.

351
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:53,514
Over here!

352
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:59,061
Hurry.

353
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:20,374
Are you all right?

354
00:32:20,624 --> 00:32:22,042
Hey.

355
00:32:24,127 --> 00:32:26,338
What about you, huh?

356
00:32:39,935 --> 00:32:41,728
There you go.

357
00:32:43,313 --> 00:32:45,273
Is that comfortable?

358
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:49,820
I need you to close
your eyes now, okay?

359
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,905
You need some sleep.

360
00:32:54,157 --> 00:32:55,617
Dad?

361
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:57,536
He's gonna meet us.

362
00:32:58,662 --> 00:33:00,872
Hey. Robbie's gonna meet us, Rach.

363
00:33:01,081 --> 00:33:03,416
In Boston, at your grandma's.

364
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,753
What do you think
Mom's doing right this minute?

365
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:08,421
Mom?

366
00:33:09,547 --> 00:33:11,633
Boston. She's waiting.

367
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,553
And I know she's not sleeping,
because she is so worried about you.

368
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:17,305
And she's in Grandma's kitchen,

369
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:18,973
and she's...

370
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:23,645
She's making that awful tea
she makes.

371
00:33:23,853 --> 00:33:25,688
And they're all just...

372
00:33:26,397 --> 00:33:29,734
They're all just counting the minutes
until they see you again.

373
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:33,321
What is this?

374
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,864
What is this?

375
00:33:35,532 --> 00:33:36,658
I won.

376
00:33:36,866 --> 00:33:38,117
You won?

377
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:40,537
The walk, trot and canter.

378
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:42,664
Third place.

379
00:33:50,964 --> 00:33:53,675
Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight."

380
00:33:57,845 --> 00:33:59,764
I don't know that one.

381
00:34:00,807 --> 00:34:02,850
Sing me "Hushabye Mountain."

382
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:07,605
I'm sorry, Rach. I don't--

383
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:09,857
I don't know that one either.

384
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:34,423
I'm not bragging, babe
So don't put me down

385
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:38,219
'Cause I got the fastest
Set of wheels in town

386
00:34:38,427 --> 00:34:41,472
Something comes up to me
They don't even try

387
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:46,644
'Cause if I had a set of wings
Man, you know she could fly

388
00:34:47,102 --> 00:34:49,647
She's my little deuce coupe

389
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:52,858
You don't know what I got

390
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:56,570
Just my little deuce coupe

391
00:34:58,948 --> 00:35:01,158
You don't know what I got

392
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,085
Peach schnapps.

393
00:35:11,293 --> 00:35:12,878
Disgusting, I know it.

394
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:15,380
Found a whole case of this shit.

395
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:23,764
Thank you.

396
00:35:28,936 --> 00:35:31,021
I'm sorry about your son.

397
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,773
We got separated. He's--

398
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:36,068
He's gonna meet us in Boston.

399
00:35:42,699 --> 00:35:43,700
Did you--?

400
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:48,413
Did you lose anybody?

401
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:52,209
All of them.

402
00:35:55,045 --> 00:35:57,589
Harlan Ogilvy.

403
00:35:58,548 --> 00:35:59,925
Ray Ferrier.

404
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:01,760
I got water.

405
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:05,222
Food enough for weeks.

406
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,808
You're welcome to stay. Both of youse.

407
00:36:09,017 --> 00:36:10,685
I'm sorry.

408
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,813
I'm gonna get some sleep.

409
00:36:15,565 --> 00:36:18,109
Those machines, those...

410
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,487
...Tripods they got?

411
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:24,657
They buried them.

412
00:36:25,575 --> 00:36:27,744
Right under our feet.

413
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:30,830
Since before there--

414
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:33,458
There were even people here.

415
00:36:34,209 --> 00:36:37,128
They've been planning this
for a million years.

416
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:40,507
We're beat to shit.

417
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:41,841
Please.

418
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,177
- My daughter--
- Think about it.

419
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,850
They defeated the greatest power
in the world in a couple days.

420
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:53,102
Walked right over us.

421
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,314
And these are only the first.
They'll keep coming.

422
00:36:57,732 --> 00:36:59,067
This is not a war

423
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:02,195
any more than there's
a war between men and maggots.

424
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,323
This is an extermination.
