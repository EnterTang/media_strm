1
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,914
- 着火啦！ - 去拿水桶！
- Fire! - Get the buckets!

2
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,999
- 去海边取水！ - 怎么了？
- To the ocean! - What happened?

3
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,382
风向变了！ 救火小分队，前进！
The wind is shifting! Fire brigade, move in!

4
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,593
- 把南边的纳德龙带过来！ - 正在办！
- Bring the Nadders in from the south! - I'm on it!

5
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,054
葛伦科龙，瞄准屋顶！
Gronckles, aim for the roof!

6
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,725
干得好！ 只有几处着火点了
Good work! Just a few hot spots left.

7
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,185
- 明白！ - 高伯在哪？他仍在里面？
- Got it! - Where's Gobber? Is he still inside?

8
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,812
没，没发现他
No. Can't find him.

9
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,980
我在这
I'm right here.

10
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,399
那个怪兽将为此付出代价
That beast will pay for this.

11
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,984
高伯，出什么事了？
Gobber, what happened?

12
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:10,945
你觉得现在什么情况？ 一条龙把我家烧了
What's it look like? A dragon set my home on fire.

13
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,321
什么？
What?

14
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,659
你这次逼我太甚了，你这丑陋的大骨架！
You pushed me too far this time, you ugly bag of bones!

15
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:20,037
爸，他在说什么？ 我们的龙不会再那样做了
Dad, what's he talking about? Our dragons don't do that anymore.

16
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:24,333
他指的不是你的龙 高伯，我最后一次声明
He doesn't mean one of yours. Gobber, for the last time,

17
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,462
- 世界上从来不存在。。。 - 骨碎龙？
- there is no such thing as a... - Boneknapper?

18
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,130
骨碎龙……？
A boneknapper...?

19
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,007
什么碎来着？
What-knapper?

20
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:35,011
一种令人作呕、散发恶臭的怪物 披着一副偷抢来的骨头盔甲
A disgusting, foul beast, wearing a coat of stolen bones,

21
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,555
就像巨大的飞天骷髅
like a giant, flying skeleton.

22
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,517
恐龙手册上说骨碎龙永不停止地寻找
The dragon manual says that the Boneknapper will stop at nothing

23
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:45,438
完美的骨头来升级盔甲 太棒了
to find the perfect bone to build its coat of armor. It's awesome.

24
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:49,317
得了吧！这只是神话 这种龙根本不存在
Come on! It's a myth. It doesn't even exist.

25
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:54,071
我告诉你，这是千真万确的 我一生都在躲避它
I'm telling you, it's real. I've been running from him my whole life.

26
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,032
我房子着火也是拜它所赐
He's the one who started this fire.

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,327
斯托伊克，我们发现了高伯 挂在炉子上的内裤
Stoick, we found Gobber's underpants hanging by the stove.

28
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,704
着火的原因一定是这个
They must've started the fire.

29
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,707
你仍认为这事有关骨碎龙 还是说是你的内裤弄的？
You still think it's the Boneknapper, or just your underpants?

30
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,795
我才不想考虑这种简单问题！我清楚！ 终究，它还是找上我了
I don't think! I know! Somehow he found me again.

31
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,297
这种龙简直就像恶魔
This dragon is pure evil.

32
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:15,176
高伯，已经深夜了 我们对你的故事也厌烦了
Gobber, it's late and we're too tired for your stories.

33
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,469
现在，该休息了
Now, get some rest.

34
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,472
你休息吧，我得结束我和那条龙之间的恩怨
You rest. I'm putting an end to this.

35
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,851
走吧，菲尔，我们走
Come on, Phil, let's go.

36
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,895
反正我又不需要他们的帮助
I don't need their help, anyway.

37
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,277
我不能让他一个人去
I can't let him go by himself.

38
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,530
好了，维京人，拿起你的盾牌
All right, Vikings, grab your shields.

39
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,697
- 是！ - 是！
- Yes! - Yeah!

40
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,409
让我上船去找什么不存在的龙 没门
There's no way I'm getting on a boat to go after a fake dragon.

41
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,914
用力！往后仰，你们这些懒虫！ 快划！
Come on! Put your backs into it, you lazy dogs! Stroke!

42
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,543
- 你们都不用点力！划！ - 很有趣，是吧？
- You're not even trying! Stroke! - How fun is this? Right?

43
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,546
我们的队伍又聚在一起了 又是一场冒险……
We got the team back together, another adventure...

44
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,339
这相当酷，嘿？
This is pretty cool, huh?

45
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,592
是的，没什么比划船划到手流血更酷了
Yep, nothing cooler than rowing until your hands bleed.

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,095
我只想让你们这些孩子知道 它是我的心头之隐忧
Just want you kids to know that it touches my heart,

47
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:03,683
你们帮我宰了骨碎龙 你们就是真正的维京人
you helping me slay the Boneknapper. True Vikings, you are.

48
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,644
- 高伯，我们到了吗？ - 哦，近了我就会告诉你的
- Gobber, are we there yet? - Oh, you'll know we're close

49
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,938
这时你的耳边会传来刺耳的尖叫
when your ears explode from the piercing screams.

50
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,774
传说里说这种龙的咆哮威力相当强
Legend says this dragon's roar is so fierce,

51
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,609
可以令你骨肉分离
it can melt the flesh right off your bones.

52
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,069
不对，鱼腿
Not so, Fishlegs.

53
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,948
骨碎龙不会咆哮 这就是它可怕之处
The Boneknapper has no roar at all. That's why he's terrifying.

54
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,242
它是无声的杀手
He's a silent killer.

55
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,495
等等，如果我们没听到任何声音 我们就要死了？
Wait. So if we don't hear anything, we're dead?

56
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,957
我听不到任何声音
I don't hear anything.

57
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,671
干得好，菲尔！
Good one, Phil!

58
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:39,010
我以前没告诉过你们 我第一次遭遇令人闻风丧胆的骨碎龙时的情景？
Did I ever tell you about the first time I met the dreaded Boneknapper?

59
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:43,973
<i>那时我还是个年轻的小伙，如你们这般年纪 和我的家人正在进行夏日假期旅行</i>
<i>I was a young lad, about your age, on summer vacation with my family,</i>

60
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,975
<i>中途我要小便</i>
<i>when I heard the call of nature.</i>

61
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,519
哦！爸，停船！
Oh! Dad, pull the boat over!

62
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,063
我不是告诉你出发前就应该去了吗？
Didn't I tell ya to go before we left?

63
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:03,326
<i>我看见了一个维京战队 在战斗中被冰封住了</i>
<i>I saw an army of Vikings, frozen in battle!</i>

64
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,411
<i>其中一名维京士兵手里紧紧握着</i>
<i>Clutched in the fingers of one of the Vikings</i>

65
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,082
<i>一个小宝盒 我想拿到它</i>
<i>was a small treasure chest. I had to have it.</i>

66
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,632
<i>我手伸进去，拿出宝盒</i>
<i>I reached in and pulled out the chest.</i>

67
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,217
<i>那是我见过的 最美丽的东西</i>
<i>It was the most beautiful thing I ever saw.</i>

68
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,971
<i>但冰冻的维京士兵仍然活着</i>
<i>But the frozen Viking was alive!</i>

69
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,098
<i>他打了我的脸几拳！</i>
<i>He started punching me in the face!</i>

70
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,476
我的牙齿！
My tooth!

71
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,813
<i>而它就在此刻现身了 消无声息</i>
<i>And there it was. >I never even heard it coming.</i>

72
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,357
<i>骨碎龙</i>
<i>The Boneknapper!</i>

73
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,821
<i>它撞向冰川 冻成冰块的维京士兵几乎形成了一场雪崩</i>
<i>It crashed into the glacier, causing an avalanche of frozen Vikings!</i>

74
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,204
宝盒！
The treasure!

75
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,792
<i>我把手伸入水中</i>
<i>I reached into the water...</i>

76
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,046
<i>再次招来冰冻维京士兵迎面几拳乱打</i>
<i>...only to find the frozen Viking</i> <i>punching me in the face again!</i>

77
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,547
嘿
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

78
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,807
<i>骨碎龙想要那宝盒 但我更想要</i>
<i>The Boneknapper wanted that treasure, but I wanted it more!</i>

79
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,896
怎么去了那么久？
What took you so long?

80
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,072
你想让我们相信你被冰冻的维京士兵打了？
You expect us to believe that a frozen Viking punched you in the face?

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,740
是的，两次
Yeah, twice.

82
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,659
嘿，这种情况有可能发生
Hey, it could happen.

83
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,286
你什么意思“有可能”，这千真万确
What do you mean, "It could happen?" It did!

84
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,706
但我比那无声的怪兽更机灵
But I outsmarted the silent beast.

85
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,251
高伯，我本不想做一个纠结于细节的人
Gobber, I hate to be a stickler for details,

86
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,086
但骨碎龙并不是无声的
but Boneknappers are not silent.

87
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,755
鱼腿，我清楚的知道自己没有听到声音
Fishlegs, I know what I didn't hear.

88
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,841
- 但我可以感觉到…… - 伙计们？
- But I could feel it... - Guys?

89
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,427
- 这应该是？ - 对危险有第六感
- Are there supposed to be...? - ...had a sixth sense for danger.

90
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,095
- 我能嗅出任何东西 - 我们一定是撞上什么了……
- I can smell anything... - We're gonna hit these...

91
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,222
感受到将要发生的劫数
...taste the oncoming doom...

92
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,270
我只感觉到了石头
I'm tasting rocks.

93
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:56,772
我们到了
We're here.

94
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,276
现在，我们困在未知之所了
Now, we're stuck in the middle of nowhere

95
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,361
而且也没人知道我们在哪
and no one even knows where we are.

96
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,864
骨碎龙知道 传说中说……
Except the Boneknapper. Legend says...

97
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,450
嘿，你知道传说里还讲过什么？ 安静！
Hey, you know what legend also says? Stop talking!

98
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,411
- 好吧，那就等会再说 - 孩子们，没必要慌张
- OK, just hold on one darn second. - No need to panic, kids.

99
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:14,749
- 我都经历过好多次沉船了 - 哦，这确实让人欣慰
- I've been shipwrecked many times. - Well, that's comforting.

100
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,169
你永远不会忘记你的第一次沉船
You never forget your first shipwreck.

101
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,547
<i>我搁浅在一个岛上</i> <i>身边仅剩一把扫帚</i>
<i>I was stranded on an island with only my broom.</i>

102
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,132
<i>那是一个非常小的岛屿</i>
<i>It was a very small island.</i>

103
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,134
<i>被骨碎龙发现也就不足为奇了</i>
<i>It's no wonder the Boneknapper found me again.</i>

104
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,471
<i>它不会原谅我 拿走了那宝盒</i>
<i>He never forgave me for taking that treasure.</i>

105
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,600
<i>附近还有另一个岛 我唯一的逃生去处</i>
<i>There was another island, my only escape.</i>

106
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,978
<i>但是周围都是 嗜血的锤头鲨</i>
<i>But I was surrounded by bloodthirsty hammerhead sharks!</i>

107
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,441
<i>我只有一次机会</i>
<i>I only had one chance.</i>

108
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,444
<i>因此我径直冲过 遍布鲨鱼的海</i>
<i>So I ran across the shark-infested waters.</i>

109
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,362
接着！看着！ 拜拜，胖子！
Take that! Watch it! Night-night, fatty!

110
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,575
有人忘了刷牙
Someone forgot to brush.

111
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,622
<i>我并没料到自己会成功逃脱</i>
<i>I didn't think I was gonna make it.</i>

112
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,333
<i>但忽然间，从海里的深处跃出</i>
<i>But then, from the depths of the ocean, leapt forth</i>

113
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,503
<i>一只巨大的座头鲸</i>
<i>a giant hammerhead whale!</i>

114
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,839
座头鲸把骨碎龙吃了？
And the hammerhead whale ate the Boneknapper?

115
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,883
差一点，它逃脱了
Almost, but he got away.

116
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:10,221
几年以后，骨碎龙再次找到我 把我追至丛林之中
Years later, the dragon hunted me down again and chased me into the jungle.

117
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,932
<i>身上只剩下我深爱的打蛋器</i>
<i>All I had was my trusty egg beater.</i>

118
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,311
<i>我像山猫一样穿过茂密的丛林</i>
<i>I carved through that thick brush as fast as a jungle cat.</i>

119
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,814
<i>但是，骨碎龙仍然紧追不舍</i>
<i>Still, the Boneknapper was right behind!</i>

120
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,235
杜鹃花！
Azaleas!

121
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,113
<i>我顺着火山往上爬</i>
<i>I ran up the side of a volcano</i>

122
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,324
<i>并无畏地跃过炙热的火山口</i>
<i>and courageously leapt across the fiery crater.</i>

123
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,451
<i>就在那时，炙热的火山深处</i>
<i>Then, deep within the burning volcano,</i>

124
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,163
<i>喷出一头巨大的座头牛</i>
<i>burst forth a giant hammerhead yak!</i>

125
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:40,876
好了，等下，你是在说一头巨大的座头牛
OK, wait a minute. Now you're saying a giant hammerhead yak

126
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:45,214
从火山里跳出来吃了骨碎龙？
leapt out of a fiery volcano and ate the Boneknapper?

127
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,009
你可能会这样认为，不是吗？ 但是骨碎龙再次逃脱了！
You would've thought so, wouldn't you? But the dragon got away again!

128
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,555
我就知道那恶棍会对我穷追不舍的
I knew that boney scoundrel would keep coming after me.

129
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:57,560
<i>于是我准备了一个陷阱 守株待兔</i>
<i>So I set up a gauntlet of traps and waited for the beast.</i>

130
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,401
<i>然后它出现了</i>
<i>And when he was ready...</i>

131
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,694
<i>它直冲而来</i>
<i>...he charged!</i>

132
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,947
<i>我迅疾逃走</i>
<i>And then I ran like the wind!</i>

133
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,116
<i>但陷阱没成功</i>
<i>But the traps failed!</i>

134
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,582
<i>然后，我被逮住了</i>
<i>Then, captured,</i>

135
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,584
<i>我做了每个勇敢的维京人都会做的</i>
<i>I did what any brave Viking would do...</i>

136
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,671
- 救命！ <i>- 上帝一定听到我的祈祷了</i>
- Help! <i>- The gods must have heard my prayer.</i>

137
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,964
<i>托尔雷神</i>
<i>It was Thor!</i>

138
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,050
<i>它射出强大的霹雳</i>
<i>He tossed a mighty thunderbolt.</i>

139
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,264
- 没击中 - 等一下……
- You missed! - Wait for it...

140
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,517
<i>然后，从被砸中的大地中心窜出</i>
<i>Then, from the center of the earth, blasted forth...</i>

141
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,438
<i>一只骑在座头鲸上的座头牛</i>
<i>...the hammerhead yak riding the hammerhead whale!</i>

142
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:43,772
发射
Deploy the yak.

143
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,332
太棒了！哦！我的背！
Yes! Oh, my back!

144
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,168
喔！鲸鱼救了你？
Whoa! The whale saluted you?

145
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,714
你们相信吗？ 骨碎龙再次消失了
Can you believe it? But the Boneknapper got away again.

146
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,466
- 它又找到我... - 你在开玩笑吧？
- He found me on... - Are you kidding?

147
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,968
- 我一点都不相信 - 全是你编造的
- I don't believe any of this. - You totally made everything up!

148
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,470
- 应该想法离开这里了 - 我们得回家
- It's time to get out of here. - We need to get home.

149
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,597
你连那东西存在的一点证据都没有
You don't even have any proof that that thing exists.

150
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,433
我当然有证据 我仍拥有那样宝物
Of course I have proof. I still have the treasure.

151
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,477
这了不起的带扣
This stunning belt buckle.

152
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,647
这是在维京人的宝盒里拿出的 别在我的裤带上已有几年了
It was in the Viking's treasure chest. It's kept my pants up for years.

153
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,901
- 这相当漂亮 - 听着，高伯
- It is stunning. - Listen, Gobber?

154
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,987
与其追踪一只臆想的龙
Instead of chasing down an imaginary dragon,

155
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,198
也许我们应该想想怎么回去
maybe we should figure out how to get home.

156
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:38,160
别多说了！我听得很清楚 我有个计划
Say no more! I hear you loud and clear. I've got a plan.

157
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,705
好了，谁想做骨碎龙的诱饵？
All right. Who'd like to be dragon bait?

158
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,966
高伯，你确信这样安全吗？
Gobber, are you sure this is safe?

159
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,884
可以说是万无一失
Safety's overrated.

160
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,389
好了，计划是这样的 骨碎龙要找我，对吧？
OK, here's the plan. The Boneknapper wants me, right?

161
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,725
它从那边过来，看到鱼腿 认为是我
He comes down that trail, sees Fishlegs, thinks it's me,

162
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,687
鱼腿的跑动让菲尔释放绳索
rushes Fishlegs, causing Phil to trip that rope,

163
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:09,650
投下那骨架笼子，然后我们过去一劳永逸地结果了它
dropping that ribcage and then we rush in and finish him off, once and for all!

164
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,027
他们变老时这么傻真是悲剧
It's sad when they get old.

165
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,822
高伯，你想的太多了，明白吗？
Gobber, you're taking this way too far, OK?

166
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,617
你得面对这个事实，世上没有骨碎龙这样的东西
You need to face it. There is no such thing as the Boneknapper.

167
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,911
趴着！现在，各就各位
Wormsquat! Now, get into position.

168
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,539
就是这样，鱼腿！ 你做得很好！
Way to go, Fishlegs! You're doing fine!

169
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,708
难怪村子里的人都认为你疯了
No wonder the entire village thinks you're crazy.

170
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,876
他看到的是一动不动的维京人
Hello? He sees dead Vikings.

171
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,212
- 是的，尤其是那…… - 伙计们？
- Yeah, especially that thing about... - Guys?

172
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,715
- 这是在浪费时间 - 伙计们！
- This is a waste of time. - Guys!

173
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,633
转身！伙计，伙计！
Turn around! Guys, guys!

174
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,051
什么？
What?

175
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,513
它就在我们身后，是吗？
It's right behind us, isn't it?

176
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,940
你知道什么？没咆哮的声音
Well, what do you know? No roar.

177
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,942
快跑！
Run!

178
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,279
好吧，高伯，我们信你了！
OK, Gobber, we believe you!

179
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,912
菲尔！
Phil!

180
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,254
选对了地方 选对了地方
Find a happy place, find a happy place.

181
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,092
不，不，别！别！
No, no, please! Please!

182
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,260
它想取我头！
He wants my head!

183
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,596
我发誓它想取我头！
I swear he wants my head!

184
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,015
来吧！等我出去了。。。
Bring it on! You wait till I get out there...

185
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:27,770
等会，它在寻找完美的骨头来建造它的盔甲
Wait. It searches for the perfect bone to build its coat of armor.

186
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,106
那宝物！ 高伯，脱下你的裤子
The treasure! Gobber, take off your pants.

187
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,443
- 不！ - 等会，听我说
- No! - Wait, listen to me.

188
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,362
我觉得鱼腿是对的
I think Fishlegs was right.

189
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,323
骨碎龙本会发出嚎叫
The Boneknapper is supposed to have a roar.

190
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,868
但它不能的原因可能是因为它要的骨头其实是你的带扣
But maybe he can't because the bone he needs is your belt buckle.

191
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,953
高伯，听我说 你得给它
Gobber, please, you have to give it back.

192
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,289
没门，这是我的！
No way. It's mine!

193
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,586
把骨头还给它！
Give him back his bone!

194
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,380
不行
No!

195
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,966
- 还给他！ - 不行
- Give him back his bone! - No!

196
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,304
不行……好吧！
No... All right.

197
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,663
高伯！
Gobber!

198
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,042
好吧，你抓住我了 快点杀了我
All right, you've got me. Make it fast.

199
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,344
这场景我会做噩梦的
That's gonna give me nightmares.

200
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,847
至少，我们有骑宠了
Well, at least we have a ride home.

201
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,435
你可爱吗？是的，你很可爱！ 很可爱
Aren't you cute? Yes, you are! Yes, you are.

202
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,026
好了
All right!

203
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,904
你知道，我从没怀疑他 我一直说的是，“他是对的”
You know, I never doubted him. I was always like, "He's right."

204
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,990
这尾骨真伤脊柱
This tailbone is hurting my tailbone.

205
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,119
它显然很高兴失落的骨头回来了
He sure seems happy to have that bone back.

206
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,539
传说骨碎龙的嚎叫是为了吸引异性
Well, legend says the Boneknapper's roar is its mating call.

207
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,374
哦，那只是个传说！
Oh, that's just a myth!

208
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,298
我想现在斯托伊克会相信我了，是吗？
I think Stoick will believe me now, eh?

209
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
