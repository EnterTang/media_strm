1
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,842
Over the course
of 1,000 years,

2
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:48,917
the spiritual energy
of heaven and earth

3
00:01:49,117 --> 00:01:51,125
gave birth to the Chaos Pearl.

4
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,008
Feeding off the sun and moon,

5
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,417
its power grew
at an unstoppable rate.

6
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,000
The divine and demonic
life forces it absorbed

7
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,217
fused together,

8
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:03,500
making it unstoppable
and no less hungry.

9
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:04,925
So my master,
the supreme lord of heaven,

10
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:10,292
sent my brother and I
to put a stop to the chaos.

11
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,092
I know what you're thinking,

12
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:13,708
"Who's that dashing rogue
on the pig?"

13
00:02:13,908 --> 00:02:16,633
That would be me, Taiyi Zhenren.

14
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,250
And If I weren't so busy
being a super impressive

15
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,883
butt-kicking, day-saving monk,

16
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,000
I've been told
I could be a model.

17
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,675
Chaos Pearl.

18
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:27,925
You can't escape.

19
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,417
This is the end of the line.

20
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,941
Don't scare it, you big meanie.

21
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:37,833
Go on. There's a good pearl.

22
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,417
Come here. Here, boy!

23
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,208
Or girl?

24
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:50,708
Uh...

25
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,833
It's over!

26
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:10,833
It absorbs energy!

27
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,712
You bruised my moneymaker.

28
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,042
Someone needs a time out.

29
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,917
Hit me now. I dare ya!

30
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,167
I was just playin' around?

31
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,000
- Master!
- Master!

32
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,625
I have divided
the Chaos Pearl into two parts,

33
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:34,292
The Spirit Pearl
and the Demon Pill.

34
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:38,708
The Demon Pill is dangerous
and nearly indestructible.

35
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm casting a heaven-made curse,

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
a lightning bolt that
will seek out and destroy it

37
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,925
in three years' time.

38
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,375
Until that day,
you must stay vigilant

39
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:50,000
and watch over it.

40
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:54,458
Li Jing has won my favor
in battle.

41
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:56,383
And so, the Spirit Pearl

42
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,750
will be reincarnated
into his third-born son.

43
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:05,792
I shall entrust this task
to you, my disciple.

44
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:06,342
Huh?

45
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:07,550
Right now,

46
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,921
Eleven Golden Immortals
sit beside me.

47
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:14,292
If the pearl
is successfully reincarnated,

48
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:17,008
then you shall join me

49
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,300
in the Court of Heaven.

50
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,792
You can count on me, master.

51
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:21,292
Thank you so much!

52
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,042
Once the Spirit Pearl is born

53
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,708
call him...

54
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,250
Ne Zha.

55
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:40,800
J I love a party &

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,333
J And parties love me J

57
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,542
J It's baby time J

58
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:47,717
Mm! Ha!

59
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:50,333
How 'bout a swiggy
for the piggy?

60
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,000
Please.

61
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,125
Careful.

62
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,467
Dear, you should worship too.

63
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,175
Why didn't I think of that?

64
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,667
I've only been pregnant
for three years!

65
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:35,708
From the Cave of Golden Light,

66
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:37,708
my name is Taiyi Zhen...

67
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,000
...ren.

68
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:43,583
- Come on.
- Wait for me!

69
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,708
- Hurry up! Move it, slowpoke!
- Come on!

70
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:47,508
- Yeah, slowpoke!
- Come on!

71
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,125
- LI RESIDENCE
- This is so exciting.

72
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,717
A third son! Congratulations!

73
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,667
I'll be a matchmaker
for the little man.

74
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,292
We wrote him a song.
Wanna hear it?

75
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:07,250
Thank you for your concern
and well-wishes, my friends.

76
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,708
But for now, please remain calm
and quiet.

77
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,383
Just wait for the good news

78
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,170
and we'll alert you...

79
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,958
...as soon as he's here.

80
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,208
I can't take it!

81
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,258
He approaches.

82
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,300
Or I think.

83
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,150
Master Immortal,
I have something for you...

84
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,000
I can't drink now.
That'd be so unprofessional.

85
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,675
I'll just leave it here.

86
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,125
I have important things to do.
Take it away.

87
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:36,467
Hey.

88
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,625
Ah, some people
just don't listen.

89
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,316
Well, one sip can't hurt!

90
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:47,375
Don't want it going to waste!

91
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:51,675
That's nice.

92
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,917
I mean, I'm basically
almost done. So...

93
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:06,500
Enjoy your enchanted
three-day nap!

94
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,333
Ah!

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,925
I knew it! A spell was cast,

96
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,958
so only Taiyi
would be able to move it.

97
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,217
Your highness.

98
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:31,083
The immortal's spell
must be cast soon!

99
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:32,500
Has the time come?

100
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:33,925
What's wrong?

101
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,925
He passed out,
I think he's drunk.

102
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,250
<i>- He's what?
- guess we'll have 10 do it</i>

103
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,375
the hard way.

104
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,758
Now hold on.

105
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,708
We can't just go beating up
on the man.

106
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:43,550
He's an immortal. It's wrong!

107
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,417
Milord!
She won't last much longer!

108
00:08:46,617 --> 00:08:47,375
Out of the way!

109
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,375
Oh, you wouldn't believe
the crazy dream I just had.

110
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:02,967
I beg you. Open the lotus!

111
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,542
Oh, yeah! I knew
there was something I forgot!

112
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,333
OPEN

113
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,483
Go on! Is something wrong?

114
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,708
I can't remember the password.

115
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,333
That was some
crazy strong stuff!

116
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,583
Okay, let's see, uh...

117
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,792
No big deal!
I have four more tries.

118
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,458
What the heck?

119
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,167
And if you're wrong
a fifth time?

120
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:40,925
It locks itself

121
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,958
and we can try again
in ten years.

122
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,917
Come, out!

123
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,458
Milord! The lady has fainted!

124
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:51,217
Oh, I got it!

125
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:53,500
- Don't!
- Is he mad?

126
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,050
I just remembered.

127
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,133
If you forget the password,

128
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,292
you can just verify
with a handprint.

129
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,833
Look over there,
it's happy hour!

130
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:08,917
Huh?

131
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,667
I knew something felt off
with you.

132
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,542
Look! A Slave Rune.

133
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,542
Huh?

134
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,667
Huh?

135
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,108
He's got control of her!

136
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:29,241
You want it so badly?

137
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:31,375
Okay, I'll give one back.

138
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:33,667
Halt!

139
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,042
Oh, boy.

140
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:18,250
Milord! I'm not sure
what happened but...

141
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:23,083
What?

142
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:54,967
Gotcha!

143
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,250
You're not going anywhere,
buddy...

144
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,833
Watch out!

145
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,875
Ah, he's getting away.

146
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,875
With the power of sun and moon,
of sea and sand,

147
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,458
Qiankun Hoop, obey my command!

148
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,167
Hold!

149
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,375
Take this, you little demon!

150
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:31,133
- That's my son!
- No.

151
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,292
That's the reincarnation
of the Demon Pill

152
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:34,633
and he's bad news!

153
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,300
If he didn't have
the Qiankun Hoop containing him,

154
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,750
he'd unleash a reign of terror
like the world's never seen.

155
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,425
Go back where you belong!

156
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,500
No!

157
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:51,792
My love!

158
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,796
Please don't hurt him.

159
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:56,667
Don't hurt my child!

160
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:57,467
But...

161
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,508
Lord Li!

162
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,316
For generations
we have battled against demons.

163
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:05,125
Do you think it wise
to endanger our people

164
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:07,396
by letting one live among us?

165
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,467
As the leader of Chentang Pass,

166
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,375
I hope you can consider
the greater good

167
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:14,542
and do what's right.

168
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:16,458
He's over there.

169
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,295
YOU HAVE A SON!

170
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:19,958
MY CONDOLENCES

171
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,217
You see that?

172
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:26,208
I'm here. Don't be scared.

173
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:42,333
Your Grace. Everyone...

174
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,942
My family is unfortunate.
This I know.

175
00:14:45,142 --> 00:14:47,417
But my son
is also just a victim

176
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:48,875
of this misfortune.

177
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,542
And I'm not of the mind
to kill an innocent child.

178
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:54,758
I will take care
of Ne Zha's education,

179
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,875
and I promise he won't set foot
in the village.

180
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:58,258
If he brings you any harm,

181
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,733
then I will receive
your punishment.

182
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,208
I'm willing to pay
the ultimate price.

183
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,717
Even if we spare him.

184
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,383
He'll only have three years.

185
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,958
The Supreme Lord
put a curse on the Pill

186
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:11,342
so three years from today,

187
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,208
a lightning bolt will strike him
and take his life.

188
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:15,750
Oh.

189
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,217
His curse can't be broken.

190
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,583
I'll convince him
to have it removed.

191
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:24,333
Don't worry. my darling.
I will protect our child.

192
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:02,958
THE DRAGON PALACE

193
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,333
Finally...

194
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,567
This is the Spirit Pearl?

195
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:28,217
If I infuse it into an egg...

196
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:31,250
That means my son
will be all-powerful.

197
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,550
Unstoppable.

198
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,108
And my child will become a god?

199
00:16:36,308 --> 00:16:39,467
You'll never...

200
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,542
- Never what?
- Fail, sir!

201
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,958
Oh, very well.

202
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,842
This is my son, Ao Bing.

203
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:10,875
As agreed,
I will entrust him to you

204
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:12,792
and he shall call you master.

205
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,295
On the condition
you help free him

206
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:17,958
from this underwater purgatory.

207
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,462
And he joins Heaven's Court.

208
00:17:20,662 --> 00:17:22,717
- I can't...
- You can't?

209
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,837
...can't be defeated.

210
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:26,758
I'm going to prove to you

211
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:30,375
that you've put your trust
in the most worthy immortal.

212
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,258
Next time...

213
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,500
Could you do me a favor
and just nod?

214
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,300
That right there
is a void portal.

215
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,000
The Supreme Lord entered
a realm beyond the three worlds,

216
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,292
so this door is the only way
we can get to him.

217
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:57,383
Supreme Lord! It is I!
Your disciple, Taiyi.

218
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,292
Taiyi, do you understand

219
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:02,508
what you've done?

220
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,508
Yes, I know I messed up

221
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,167
but it's not really my fault
because there was a demon and...

222
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,300
Ah! No excuses!

223
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,375
What took you so long to see me?

224
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,750
I get so bored by myself.

225
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,008
Ah! It's just you.

226
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,342
This is Chang ShengYun.

227
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,254
He's in charge
of the void portal.

228
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:18,043
But we just call him
Clingy Cloud.

229
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:19,833
Oh, yeah?
Well, we call you fatty!

230
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:20,842
Hello, new friend.

231
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:23,583
Not in front of company.
Treat me with some respect!

232
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:25,133
And this is Li Jing,

233
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,375
- Commander of Chengtang Pass.
- A pleasure! Really!

234
00:18:27,575 --> 00:18:29,500
It's a party! I have company!

235
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,375
Oh, yes, sit, sit!
Here, have some tea.

236
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,833
It's hard sitting here
guarding the gate every day.

237
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,175
So what's new with the mortals?

238
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,125
I've been out of the loop
for so long.

239
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,875
Please relay
to the Supreme Lord.

240
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:42,458
We seek an audience with him.

241
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:43,967
Huh? I'm sorry but...

242
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,667
Unfortunately, our master
and some of his god pals

243
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:47,967
went to the void portal.

244
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:50,050
Probably attending
to godly matters.

245
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,583
But why do you want to see him?
Do tell, do tell.

246
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,083
Someone's under
a heaven-made curse,

247
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:55,542
and II want him to call it off.

248
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:57,167
Say it ain't so!

249
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,167
Then it's useless
to speak to him.

250
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,917
That curse is unbreakable.

251
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,087
One day here is a year there.

252
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:13,467
Which means back on earth,

253
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,754
a great deal of time
has already passed.

254
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,043
We need to head back
as soon as possible.

255
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:20,333
Maybe there's something
we can do for him.

256
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:28,583
These dumb walls
crush my soul.

257
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:32,625
Even prisoners get parole.

258
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:34,771
No friends, no fun,

259
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:36,717
it's just the worst.

260
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:41,500
Hopefully boredom
will get me first.

261
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,675
Ne Zha.
What're you doing up there?

262
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,275
Can't go outside
and nobody will play with me.

263
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:50,875
So what else can I do
but check out the sights?

264
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:53,050
Then... Oh!

265
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,750
Why don't you describe
the scenery to mommy?

266
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,833
Grass, trees, and dumb flowers.

267
00:19:58,033 --> 00:19:59,917
And a guy showing his butt.

268
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:01,750
Oh, you with your jokes.

269
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,125
Hey. Why don't I play with you?

270
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:04,967
Don't mess with me.

271
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,837
You don't have more demons
to fight or something?

272
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:10,708
This is the first time
I've seen you in forever.

273
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:12,708
You never have time to play.

274
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:15,504
I know. I know this is hard.

275
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:18,092
I would love to play more, baby,

276
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:20,417
however the fortress
needs protecting.

277
00:20:20,617 --> 00:20:22,125
I can't be everywhere at once.

278
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,133
Uh...

279
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,008
But today has been peaceful.

280
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,167
How does playing jianzi
sound to you?

281
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:32,708
Well since you're so bored
I guess I can play with you.

282
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,125
Ready? Go!

283
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,375
Milady. I think you should
put your armor on.

284
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:50,383
You must be joking.

285
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,042
He is my son and we're playing.

286
00:20:52,242 --> 00:20:53,708
Nobody's died from jianzi.

287
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:55,425
Catch...

288
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,375
...this!

289
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,083
Ready...

290
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,087
Uh, you okay, ma?

291
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:02,583
I'm fine! I'm fine!

292
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,542
Good shot!

293
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,608
On second thought...

294
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,175
Did I kick it too hard?

295
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,758
No. Kick as hard as you want!

296
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,333
You two, join in.

297
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,708
Maybe you should rest.

298
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:29,583
No. I'm alright.

299
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:34,125
Look at how much fun
Ne Zha's having.

300
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,208
It's been a long time since
he smiled like that.

301
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,708
That's wonderful
for him, milady.

302
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,967
Report!

303
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:45,792
An eel spirit's destroying
the eastern fishing village.

304
00:21:45,992 --> 00:21:47,292
We need reinforcements.

305
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:48,792
Mom, catch!

306
00:21:58,542 --> 00:21:59,883
Sweetie...

307
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,500
We're going to
have to call it a day.

308
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,917
But next time...

309
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,875
We can play as long as you want.

310
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:07,792
I promise.

311
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,592
That's what you said last time.

312
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:12,467
It's fine.
I'm used to it by now.

313
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:14,750
I'll cook
your favorite when I come home!

314
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,167
- Huh?
- Huh?

315
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,008
And you two.

316
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,125
Master Immortal Taiyi
brought you here

317
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:55,883
to protect the barrier,

318
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,295
not so you can
be flashy mascots.

319
00:22:58,495 --> 00:23:00,508
Do not allow him
to get out anymore.

320
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,087
Don't worry.
I guarded the southern boundary.

321
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:05,856
And it's his fault
Ne Zha got out last time.

322
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:08,324
You are so f-full of it!
The north was secured.

323
00:23:08,524 --> 00:23:10,792
He's clearly guilty.
Just look at this guy!

324
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:12,758
Huh?
You turn that finger around!

325
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,295
Once Taiyi Zhenren returns,
you just wait!

326
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:18,085
Cause I'm sure
he loves to hear you whine!

327
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:20,675
That's it! Fight me.
Come on, you wanna go?

328
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,125
- Bring it! I ain't scared!
- Oh, yeah, chicken?

329
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:24,625
- Chicken? You are!
- Ah!

330
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:25,925
Cut it...

331
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,358
- I'll show you a chicken.
- Who's the chicken?

332
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:30,792
Chicken says "what?"

333
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:32,625
- Huh?
- Huh?

334
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,875
Huh?

335
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:47,708
Huh? What? Whatcha lookin' at?

336
00:23:47,908 --> 00:23:49,667
Huh?

337
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:01,792
What's the big idea...

338
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,458
Body Slam!

339
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,958
Dragon Whip!

340
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,458
Crabby Sea Monster!

341
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,000
Immortal Picking Grapes!

342
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,000
Come on, Dad!

343
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,333
- One!
- Huh?

344
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,750
Two!

345
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:29,000
He's out again!

346
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,417
Three!

347
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,250
Four!

348
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:42,167
Five.

349
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,458
Six!

350
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:47,208
Seven!

351
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,833
Eight.

352
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:52,375
Nine!

353
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:55,883
Ten.

354
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,583
Ready or not...

355
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,375
Huh?

356
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:49,317
I've had enough.

357
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:50,417
Let's fight.

358
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,833
But boss. There's no way
we can beat Ne Zha.

359
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:54,758
Not true!

360
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:57,583
Are we, or are we not
The Demonhunters Gang?

361
00:25:57,783 --> 00:25:59,208
Until we can figure out a way...

362
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:00,625
no one goes home!

363
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,125
Huh?

364
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:08,000
I have a way, boss!

365
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,417
Huh? I told you to keep guard.

366
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:10,092
Go back.

367
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:12,917
I was thinking
we could set some traps.

368
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,917
Like what?

369
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,542
Check this out!

370
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,583
Ne Zha's gonna
come down that bridge,

371
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,042
but he won't know I
cut the ropes...

372
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:22,167
- And bam!
- Ah!

373
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,425
When he hits the ground,

374
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,167
it'll trigger the second trap,

375
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:27,958
an overhead basket filled
with sharp pointy objects!

376
00:26:28,158 --> 00:26:29,133
He'll reach

377
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,125
for the nearest shield,
which will be an old pan.

378
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,383
But surprise!

379
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,083
There's another trap
within that trap!

380
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,800
He'll run and run and run...

381
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,792
And "What's that?
A safe space to hide?"

382
00:26:39,992 --> 00:26:41,133
But not so fast...

383
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,417
Lift-off!

384
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,333
Boom!

385
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:46,858
But better watch out...

386
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:48,250
For that venomous snake!

387
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:51,083
And he'll start climbing
the rope ladder near the tree.

388
00:26:51,283 --> 00:26:53,092
Which should make
all those hornets

389
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:54,958
in the hornet's nest I put there
really mad.

390
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,333
if he doesn't want
to get stung so bad

391
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:00,175
his head swells like a balloon,

392
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,208
he'll have to jump
into the mud pit.

393
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:03,717
And when he finally crawls out,

394
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:07,500
he'll be so scared and angry
smoke will come out of his ears.

395
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:10,050
Nice! I never noticed
how clever you were.

396
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,375
I'd have to be smart to hang out
with someone like you.

397
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,375
You know, when you're right,
you're right.

398
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:18,083
But he needs
something way worse.

399
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,417
I got it, let's add some sea
urchins to the pit!

400
00:27:20,617 --> 00:27:22,375
That'll do the trick.

401
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:24,375
It's important for him
to stay hydrated.

402
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:28,917
Um, guys?
You don't think that's too mean?

403
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:30,021
Huh? He's mean.

404
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:30,925
He humiliates us so

405
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,066
- we're just returning the favor.
- Yes.

406
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:35,208
- Yeah. That's right!
- Yeah. Exactly.

407
00:27:35,408 --> 00:27:37,458
All right. Well you're the boss.

408
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:39,292
Who am I to disagree?

409
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:42,167
Hold on. I just had
an important thought.

410
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,083
- What is it?
- If our plan starts with Ne Zha

411
00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:46,542
on the bridge,
how do we get him there?

412
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:47,467
That part's easy.

413
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,583
We can scare him onto it.

414
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,042
- Huh?
- Like how?

415
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,833
Like...

416
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,775
You were right about one thing.

417
00:28:22,975 --> 00:28:24,917
It's important to stay hydrated!

418
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,667
You guys! You guys!

419
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,712
- He beat me up.
- Huh?

420
00:28:28,912 --> 00:28:30,375
And he took all my clothes!

421
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,462
Well fellas, it's been real.

422
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:34,375
You guys are a lot of fun.

423
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,208
Yeah? Laugh all you want.

424
00:28:36,408 --> 00:28:37,250
You demon!

425
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:42,917
What did you just call me?

426
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,925
I said...

427
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:47,208
- You're a demon!
- No!

428
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,333
Ne Zha!

429
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,417
That'll be enough of that.

430
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,050
- Boundary Beasts!
- Sir!

431
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,383
Tighten the boundary.

432
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:21,500
He's now prohibited from
setting foot outside this room.

433
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,500
Sir!

434
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,000
Enough.

435
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:42,583
We expected
this might happen one day.

436
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:45,000
We tried but...

437
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,042
maybe this is just his fate.

438
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:53,375
Even after forbidding them
from mentioning the word demon,

439
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:55,708
people will never see him
as anything but.

440
00:29:55,908 --> 00:29:58,042
And I've been so busy
fighting monsters

441
00:29:58,242 --> 00:29:59,792
to gain goodwill on his behalf.

442
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:03,125
I've neglected my boy.

443
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,167
He only has two years left.

444
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,425
Let's resign our
positions.

445
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:11,708
Take him to play
in the mountains,

446
00:30:11,908 --> 00:30:13,167
and just be with him.

447
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,792
Until the end.

448
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:23,967
Uh, Lady Yin? This is on me.

449
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,625
So I've decided to take him on
as an apprentice.

450
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,717
I'll shape the Demon Pill

451
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:31,042
into a demon-fighting
warrior of justice.

452
00:30:31,242 --> 00:30:33,167
Is that our only option?

453
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,292
To put him through all that?

454
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,542
Shouldn't we just let him
enjoy the time he's got?

455
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,250
I do not wish to rob him
of a meaningful life.

456
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,675
And would you want this?

457
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,333
For him to be remembered as
a demon?

458
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:55,550
Master Ne Zha!

459
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,792
Time for breakfast.

460
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:04,042
Huh?

461
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:06,375
The young Master's
escaped again.

462
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,375
What? Oh, no!

463
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,008
What?

464
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,500
- That's impossible.
- Mm-hm.

465
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,296
- I agree.
- Don't stand there!

466
00:31:17,496 --> 00:31:19,000
<i>Report this 10 Master I.</i>

467
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,333
- You can count on me!
- I'm on it.

468
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:28,292
There's no guard alive...

469
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,833
who can keep me locked up.

470
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,625
Huh?

471
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,875
Wha...

472
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:42,750
Eh?

473
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,375
Woah.

474
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:11,300
Welcome to the world

475
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,250
Inside the painting.
Scenic isn't it?

476
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,050
What's the big id...

477
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,042
Ah-da-da. Hold onto your socks.

478
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,750
I'm about to show you
a little somethin'.

479
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,900
With one stroke,
you can change the painting

480
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,542
to reflect whatever
your little heart desires!

481
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,004
You've got a brush. Big deal!

482
00:32:30,204 --> 00:32:31,592
Why don't you just sit back

483
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:33,667
and watch this bad boy
in action!

484
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,917
Do your thing, brush!

485
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:47,125
No, no, no.

486
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,875
Wow!

487
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,125
Young apprentice,
we haven't even started!

488
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:02,167
Wow...

489
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:12,583
Mighty impressive, huh?

490
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,550
Just think,
you can spend every day here

491
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,733
learning the Immortal magic
of Kunlun with me.

492
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,917
Go ahead. Call me master,
I know you're impressed.

493
00:34:21,117 --> 00:34:22,717
Master?

494
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:24,750
What could I learn from you?

495
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:29,792
Huh? Why you...
You're in trouble now.

496
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:32,875
On my command,
one, two, change!

497
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,125
Look out.

498
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:41,667
Magic'd!

499
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,333
- Huh?
- That's my handy-dandy

500
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:45,967
disguising spell.

501
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,833
- Wanna learn it?
- Yeah!

502
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:49,333
This looks yummy.

503
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,817
So can you make me
look all big and scary?

504
00:34:58,017 --> 00:34:59,467
Now what would I go
and do all that for?

505
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:02,667
Also, that's next-level stuff,
even I can't pull that off.

506
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,750
Don't get fancy,
learn the basics.

507
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:05,550
Come on little guy.

508
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,458
Your master's gonna teach you...

509
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,858
That's easy.
Teach me something cooler.

510
00:35:13,058 --> 00:35:14,842
The disguising spell
is the most basic.

511
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:17,958
If you won't learn that
then I won't even bother!

512
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,958
Fine. Watch me knock this out.

513
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,125
On my command! Change!

514
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:26,333
Change!

515
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,550
Change!

516
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,258
The disguising spell
isn't even remotely basic.

517
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:35,000
Took me six whole months
to master my first disguise.

518
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,792
Knock yourself out,
take your time.

519
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,833
AN IMMORTAL PREPARES

520
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,833
Master? Master.

521
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,875
Lady Yin. What a nice surprise.

522
00:35:59,075 --> 00:35:59,800
I'm checking on Ne Zha.

523
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,333
I'm just teaching him
some stuff.

524
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:03,583
Where is my son?

525
00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:04,833
Oh, right there...

526
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:07,167
Huh?

527
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,375
Hang on. What is that?

528
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:14,316
Ah! Hang on, kid.

529
00:36:14,516 --> 00:36:16,125
I'll save you.

530
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,625
Ne Zha. What happened?

531
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:32,383
What is this?

532
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:35,542
Huh? I didn't do that!
I promise you!

533
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:36,925
How'd this happen?

534
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,083
Oh, good, he has a pulse.

535
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:57,792
Oh! Oh, no! It's poisonous.

536
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:12,792
You should treat me
with more respect.

537
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:15,796
How'd you master that spell
so quickly?

538
00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:17,875
I don't know,
by being super awesome?

539
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,425
Okay, don't get jealous.

540
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:22,292
Even though it took him one day
what took you six months.

541
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:25,008
Share your trick

542
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,008
with your beloved master?

543
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,417
Teach me more Immortal Magic
and I'll tell you.

544
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,300
Yep! You got it, kid!

545
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,042
Since your element is fire,
I'll teach you fire control.

546
00:37:34,242 --> 00:37:35,667
Tongue of flame. Sands of time.

547
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,292
Unleash heat
from the holy shrine.

548
00:37:37,492 --> 00:37:38,792
Make it so!

549
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,758
Not cool, that got in my eye.

550
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:49,025
I can't say this spell right
with my tongue all swollen.

551
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,292
Aha! Good thing I have
an anti-venom pill in my pants.

552
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,092
Oh, I can't reach it.

553
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:59,208
Can you get it for me,
little guy, please?

554
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:00,458
No problem.

555
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,458
Whoa! You've got
like treasure pants!

556
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,542
Huh? What's this
weird moppy thingy?

557
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:09,500
It's for flies.

558
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:12,792
What?
What about this shiny thing?

559
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,417
That's a fire-tipped spear.

560
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,250
A fire-tipped spear,
huh?

561
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:18,758
Hey, don't touch that switch.

562
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,917
You mean this switch?

563
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:26,417
Huh? Ha?

564
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:37,417
Ne Zha!
Are you causing trouble again?

565
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,500
Your grace! Are you all right?

566
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:48,458
I'm an immortal,
I can't get hurt, but thanks.

567
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,962
Ne Zha. If you show me respect,

568
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,717
the things I'll teach you...

569
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:55,817
Like banishing demons
and defeating monsters.

570
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:58,917
What? Banish demons?
And defeat monsters?

571
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,292
Nice try! Like I'd ever
learn anything from you.

572
00:39:02,492 --> 00:39:03,417
How do I get out of here?

573
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:05,500
Well you'll have to use
this little landscape brush,

574
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,167
if you wish to escape
from the painting.

575
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:09,342
Oh, wait a minute.

576
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:11,750
You want to keep me
locked up in here.

577
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,842
No don't be silly.

578
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:15,542
A place this lovely
could never be a prison, dear.

579
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,542
It's a "training retreat."â€

580
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:20,000
So I train
and they'd still hate me anyway.

581
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,667
I'd be better off
just taking a nap.

582
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:26,625
Ne Zha.
I'm your mother.

583
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:30,375
I know you. I know you want
the others to accept you.

584
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:35,042
But you feel more and more alone
every time they rejected you.

585
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:36,583
And you resent them for that.

586
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,342
Young master?

587
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:44,750
How did he get out again?
Young master?

588
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,750
Huh?

589
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,542
Hi, you wanna play?

590
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,000
Mm-hm!

591
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:00,208
Ne Zhal!

592
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:01,883
I thought he was locked away!

593
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:05,458
- They let him out!
- Everyone run!

594
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:17,046
Go back to where you came from!

595
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:18,675
- Yeah!
- Little demon brat!

596
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,000
- No one likes you!
- You're a Demon!

597
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,875
Yeah, no one wants you here!

598
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:24,292
Go away!

599
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,400
You've been through a lot,
but it will be alright.

600
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,000
After your training you'll
be able to banish demons

601
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,583
with us and earn
their admiration.

602
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:39,500
Why would I do anything
for them? Never!

603
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,883
They wanna see me as a demon?

604
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,792
I'll show them what a demon
really looks like!

605
00:40:42,992 --> 00:40:44,208
Dear, you...

606
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:50,333
I guess it's time
we tell you the truth.

607
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:52,958
The secret we've kept
for so long.

608
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:57,050
Why they're so afraid.

609
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,483
You are actually...

610
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:01,917
The Spirit, what?

611
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,250
Oh. right, right. right!

612
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,717
The reincarnation!

613
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:10,542
And it's that divine strength
they find so intimidating.

614
00:41:10,742 --> 00:41:12,833
Are you... lying?

615
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:15,258
Use your head.

616
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:16,967
Your father and I are humans.

617
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:19,333
How could we give birth
to a demon?

618
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:22,292
Then, why don't you just
tell them I'm the Spirit Pearl?

619
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:24,217
The Spirit Pearl
was a secret weapon

620
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:26,508
the Supreme Lord sent down
to the mortal realm.

621
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:29,708
It's not called an "everyone
knows about it" weapon.

622
00:41:29,908 --> 00:41:32,333
They couldn't
handle the truth.

623
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,958
The truth...

624
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,458
In the meantime,
try to win their hearts.

625
00:41:37,658 --> 00:41:39,125
Treat them as if they're family.

626
00:41:39,325 --> 00:41:39,967
Keep them safe from harm,

627
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,337
and they'll surely
return the favor,

628
00:41:42,537 --> 00:41:44,708
embracing you
as one of their own.

629
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,125
TWO YEARS LATER

630
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:13,625
Total piece of cake.

631
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:21,583
No, no, no.
Way too impulsive.

632
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,792
Show him, go on.

633
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,833
Stop there.

634
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,333
Yummy human!

635
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:58,833
See here?

636
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,792
And here too.

637
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,417
Look at that. You harmed
all those innocent civilians,

638
00:43:13,617 --> 00:43:15,312
just to destroy
a couple skeletons.

639
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,208
Yeah, they're
not even real though.

640
00:43:17,408 --> 00:43:18,467
What's the big deal.

641
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:20,375
If you can't do the right thing
in training,

642
00:43:20,575 --> 00:43:22,542
how can we trust you
in the real world.

643
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:26,000
Your Grace, take away
his Chaotic Silk and spear.

644
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,258
Until he learns self-control,

645
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:29,417
he's banned from
such powerful weapons.

646
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,542
Fine, so take it back.
See if I care!

647
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:34,417
I've learned
all your Immortal Magic,

648
00:43:34,617 --> 00:43:35,792
so I can go kick demon butt.

649
00:43:35,992 --> 00:43:36,800
No way.

650
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,250
In fact, from now on
your only focus

651
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,758
will be meditation not fighting.

652
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:44,083
What? You wanted me to learn
how to fight monsters.

653
00:43:44,283 --> 00:43:45,008
Well I did that!

654
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,792
Oh, why won't you
let me out of here?

655
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,667
You're not leaving here
'til I say so.

656
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:52,883
Yeah, whatever.

657
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:54,983
I'd like to see you
try and stop me.

658
00:43:55,183 --> 00:43:57,083
- Huh, how'd he get that?
- Ne Zha!

659
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,566
Don't worry, I got this!

660
00:43:59,766 --> 00:44:01,583
They're gonna love me!

661
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:46,592
I'm so sick of seafood.

662
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:49,542
But it's good
to change things up.

663
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:53,175
Yo, demon!

664
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,208
Let go of that dog!

665
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:57,175
Huh?

666
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:59,167
Huh?

667
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,375
What, you want me
to eat you instead?

668
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,583
Right here!

669
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:10,292
Why...

670
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,633
Huh?

671
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,000
- Huh?
- Huh?

672
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:26,417
Oh, no, you don't!

673
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:49,800
Huh?

674
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,208
Get out here!

675
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:53,417
Show your face!

676
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:57,708
Stop!

677
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,542
Turn around and watch this!

678
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:02,625
Come out! Stop hiding!

679
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,792
Be like that.

680
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,583
Guess I'll have
to smoke you out!

681
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:18,000
- How horrible!
- Ne Zha's gone mad!

682
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:27,333
Hey!
Where you think you're goin'?

683
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,083
Ready? It's coming!

684
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:43,708
Huh?

685
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,208
Ne Zha kidnapped Yaya!

686
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:08,625
Good luck catching me
in the sea, puny human!

687
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,167
I've frozen the sea
for half a kilometer.

688
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:19,375
You can't escape.

689
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:25,458
Demon, let the girl go.

690
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,967
Why should I listen to you?

691
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:31,667
Stay back, child.
I'm here to save her.

692
00:47:31,867 --> 00:47:33,050
I'm not a child!

693
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,250
You should surrender.

694
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,792
Wrong choice.

695
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,500
Back off
and get in line, weirdo!

696
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,458
I saw this guy first!

697
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:58,708
What... what on earth
are you doing?

698
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,467
Huh?

699
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:03,000
Wait your turn!
I'll kick your butt next!

700
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,750
Where are you paren...

701
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:11,833
Town's only big enough
for one cool guy.

702
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:16,417
- Hey, demon! Let that girl go!
- Huh?

703
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:19,833
There's something
different about you.

704
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:20,875
Whatever!

705
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:37,292
Ow, let go! I said let go!

706
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:44,375
Huh? Woah, you have horns!

707
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,083
Huh.

708
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,542
Huh, bubbles?

709
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,842
What's goin' on?

710
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,925
Take a good look around you.

711
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,083
I should thank you both
for giving me time

712
00:49:25,283 --> 00:49:27,000
to unleash my special attack.

713
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,937
Go on, make a move.

714
00:49:29,137 --> 00:49:30,875
Not so tough now, huh?

715
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:33,542
I can finally have my dinner
in peace.

716
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,592
Hey, spit her out!

717
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:41,375
When I get done with you,
you'll wish that you...

718
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:53,375
You don't look so good.

719
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:55,758
Uh-oh, my spit gotcha!

720
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:59,042
Seems like you hit
"rock bottom".

721
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:01,842
Maybe in your next life

722
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:05,125
you'll learn
to mind your own business.

723
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:11,875
Huh?

724
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,542
Bring it on, kid!

725
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:56,383
Please have mercy!

726
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:58,417
I'll give you the antidote!

727
00:50:58,667 --> 00:50:59,708
Antidote?

728
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,750
Don't worry. It's enough.

729
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:19,458
It tastes like garlic!

730
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:23,667
Huh? Look at that!

731
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:26,375
How'll they drink?
Their mouths can't move!

732
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,417
Uh, you can also apply it
to the skin.

733
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:34,883
Why didn't you say so?

734
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:38,042
Well, because you didn't ask.

735
00:51:40,042 --> 00:51:43,708
That's right,
spread it evenly.

736
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:46,000
You have to
really massage it in.

737
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,842
The skin'll absorb it faster.

738
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:51,708
Plus, it makes the complexion
all dewy!

739
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,900
- Wait.
- Huh?

740
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,050
Spare me.

741
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,275
I just wanted a snack.

742
00:52:19,475 --> 00:52:21,300
I didn't eat a person.

743
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,046
You gave us the antidote.
So I'm grateful.

744
00:52:24,246 --> 00:52:26,792
But if you try to do evil
in the future,

745
00:52:26,992 --> 00:52:28,583
I won't spare you again.

746
00:52:28,783 --> 00:52:30,375
Okay, okay.

747
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:33,258
Hey, you! Boy!

748
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:34,754
What? Still wanna fight?

749
00:52:34,954 --> 00:52:36,627
That's not fair to you.

750
00:52:36,827 --> 00:52:38,300
Huh? I'm no match for you?

751
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,333
Come on then.
Show me what you got.

752
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:42,292
- Thank you for saving me.
- Huh?

753
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:44,667
And for saving
this girl as well.

754
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:46,092
Today you were my ally.

755
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:48,917
I will find a way to repay
the kindness you've shown.

756
00:52:49,117 --> 00:52:50,508
Nah, it was nothin'.

757
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:53,383
I was simply following
the will of Heaven.

758
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:57,500
Cause I was destined
to be a great demon slayer!

759
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:03,625
You're not afraid of me?

760
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:06,750
You save Yaya from bad guy.

761
00:53:33,667 --> 00:53:35,708
Hm. Huh?

762
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:21,967
Hey. What's wrong?

763
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:24,650
It's nothing.
Just got eyes in my sand.

764
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:27,133
You mean sand
in your eyes?

765
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:30,417
Let me see.
I can get it out for you.

766
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:37,083
Aw man! This is so embarrassing!

767
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:38,467
Okay, fine!

768
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:41,125
My mom's the only other person
who'll play this with me.

769
00:54:41,325 --> 00:54:43,250
So I got emotional. Big deal!

770
00:54:48,542 --> 00:54:49,375
Huh?

771
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,092
We're friends now.

772
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:53,792
If you want to play again,
come to the shore and blow this.

773
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:57,333
When I hear the conch shell,
I'll come from wherever I am.

774
00:54:57,533 --> 00:54:59,167
I forgot. I'm Ao Bing.

775
00:54:59,367 --> 00:55:00,050
And you?

776
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,125
My name's Ne Zha!

777
00:55:03,792 --> 00:55:04,917
Your friends?

778
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:06,583
What?

779
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,750
- There she is!
- He's here!

780
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:12,958
Huh?

781
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:20,792
There's Ne Zha.
He kidnapped Yaya!

782
00:55:20,992 --> 00:55:21,425
The demon!

783
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:22,542
My baby! Oh, Yaya!

784
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,879
Yaya! How are you feeling?

785
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:27,292
Ne Zha hit. Pow, pow, pow!

786
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:29,167
Demon go, boom, boom!

787
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:31,208
Why would you kidnap
a little girl!?

788
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:32,092
That's not what happened!

789
00:55:32,292 --> 00:55:33,837
If I hadn't
chased that thing down,

790
00:55:34,037 --> 00:55:35,583
she would've been
demon-food already.

791
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,875
So where's the demon then?
Did you see one?

792
00:55:38,075 --> 00:55:38,800
How about you?

793
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,583
Do you seriously think
we're that dumb?

794
00:55:40,783 --> 00:55:41,958
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

795
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:44,458
You won't get away with this!

796
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:50,792
Okay, I see.

797
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:55,250
Go away, you demon brat!

798
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:03,125
You wanna say that again?

799
00:56:03,325 --> 00:56:04,250
Stop it!

800
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,883
See? He's a monster!

801
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:16,542
- We'll kill you!
- Die, demon!

802
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:46,566
Your master has arrived.

803
00:56:46,766 --> 00:56:48,208
Stop hurting people.

804
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,417
Ne Zha.

805
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:57,300
Commander Li!

806
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,667
Ne Zha burned down the village,
kidnapped a child,

807
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:01,967
and attacked the villagers.

808
00:57:02,167 --> 00:57:04,758
We demand he be punished.

809
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:07,400
My crimes? I'm gonna show you
a real crime!

810
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,042
Ne Zha, don't.

811
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,625
Lord Li, you must lock
this demon-child up.

812
00:57:22,825 --> 00:57:25,125
Never again to see
the light of day.

813
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:27,625
Lock him up!
And throw away the key!

814
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:28,717
Lord Li,

815
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:31,000
you must get your son
under control!

816
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:33,167
We'd thank you!

817
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:38,375
He's destroying everything!

818
00:57:38,575 --> 00:57:40,417
It's not safe!

819
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,800
Father... Master.

820
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,300
How did today's assignment go?

821
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,400
I made seven lesser revolutions
and four greater ones.

822
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,500
I learned to ice over rivers
and create frost and snow.

823
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,167
I've reached the seventh heaven
of the Ice Jade.

824
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:07,108
Also... I made a friend.

825
00:58:07,308 --> 00:58:09,375
I met him near the seashore.

826
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:11,592
Wha... what do you mean a friend?

827
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:14,008
You can't reveal your identity.

828
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:16,425
He was a human,
but he didn't care what I was.

829
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:19,333
- Because I'm his friend.
- And who was this person?

830
00:58:19,533 --> 00:58:21,917
His name was... Ne Zha.

831
00:58:22,117 --> 00:58:24,425
Huh?

832
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:28,467
Sma... small world, apprentice.

833
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:31,375
Sounds like you just met
the Demon Pill.

834
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,383
- Oh, no.
- Ne Zha...

835
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:35,958
is your sworn rival.

836
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,170
We've waited
three whole years.

837
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:40,008
On the day the reckoning occurs,

838
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:43,167
the Demon Pill will begin
a mama... massacre...

839
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:45,508
and then you will rescue
Chentang Pass

840
00:58:45,708 --> 00:58:49,750
and claim your birthright
as the Spirit Pearl.

841
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:53,458
Master, might he be granted
redemption?

842
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:56,792
In the times of antiquity,

843
00:58:57,292 --> 00:59:00,458
we dragons
were all-powerful beings,

844
00:59:00,658 --> 00:59:02,292
revered and worshipped.

845
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,083
On behalf of Heaven,
we fought monsters,

846
00:59:06,283 --> 00:59:08,258
subduing them in the ocean,

847
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:11,125
earning us
the title of Dragon Kings.

848
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:13,258
Do you understand

849
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:15,583
what this place really is?

850
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:16,883
Our Palace, right?

851
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:18,925
Beneath the magma
of this volcano

852
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:23,958
are the countless creatures
we defeated those many years ago

853
00:59:24,158 --> 00:59:27,750
at the request
of the Supreme Lord.

854
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:32,833
"Dragon Palace"?

855
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:38,125
It's as much our prison
as it is theirs.

856
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:42,425
If we were to leave this place,

857
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:47,875
the monsters would break free of
their imprisonment and escape.

858
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,383
Do you see now, son?

859
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:53,083
They tricked us into
doing their dirty work for them.

860
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:54,717
After all.

861
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:57,550
What were we to Heaven

862
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:01,167
other than just monsters
to be locked away.

863
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,050
The title "King" they gave us?

864
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:07,750
It's laughable.
I am nothing more than

865
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:09,792
another prisoner in this pit.

866
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:14,833
We sealed our fate the moment
we took them at their word.

867
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:18,217
So, my boy,
for the past millennium,

868
01:00:18,417 --> 01:00:23,208
the Spirit Pearl has been
our only hope for freedom.

869
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:24,800
In one year's time,

870
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,208
I'll be able to completely
remove the horns on your head

871
01:00:28,408 --> 01:00:31,541
and hide your identity
as a dada... dragon.

872
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:34,675
If you're victorious
on the day of reckoning.

873
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:38,250
Then and only then will you
win a place in Heaven,

874
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,500
and be able
to break the dragons free

875
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,458
of this underwater purgatory.

876
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:48,625
Our fate rests entirely
on your shoulders.

877
01:00:48,825 --> 01:00:50,979
Don't let yourself be fooled

878
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:53,333
by the illusion of friendship.

879
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:01,921
* I'm a scary demon *

880
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:04,425
* Better run and hide *

881
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:06,708
* Legend says I'll eat and eat *

882
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:09,208
* 'Til everyone has died *

883
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:12,375
<i>* And they're right
You should steer clear *</i>

884
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,717
* Best take their suggestion *

885
01:01:14,917 --> 01:01:17,167
<i>* Cause when I eat too much *</i>

886
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:20,125
* I get real bad indigestion *

887
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:28,333
Please eat. You haven't had
anything in three days.

888
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:40,833
Dear. How long are you going
to be like this?

889
01:01:41,033 --> 01:01:41,917
Leave me alone.

890
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:44,425
I just wanna die in peace.

891
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:46,875
* I try to help but no one cares
so honestly why bother? *

892
01:01:47,075 --> 01:01:48,792
Isn't jianzi your favorite, huh?

893
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:50,129
I could play with you right now.

894
01:01:50,329 --> 01:01:51,383
* I'm tired
Of being a burden to *

895
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:52,962
I've designed a really neat
new training course

896
01:01:53,162 --> 01:01:54,542
- in your painting...
- * My mother and my father *

897
01:01:54,742 --> 01:01:55,425
...called Ride the Clouds.

898
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:57,917
- * I kinda wish I wasn't here *
- Wanna give it a try?

899
01:01:58,117 --> 01:02:01,208
* I'll close my eyes
And disappear *

900
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:12,633
Hey! Your third birthday's
only ten days away.

901
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:16,000
The people of Chentang Pass
want to celebrate with you.

902
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,500
Yeah?

903
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:23,375
They'd celebrate my funeral.
Not my birthday.

904
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:29,083
The Sea Yaksha
can move as water,

905
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:30,175
without being noticed.

906
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:33,792
It's saliva can petrify people
and leaves a residue.

907
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,042
That misunderstanding
has been resolved.

908
01:02:37,242 --> 01:02:39,083
They know you drove off
the demon.

909
01:02:39,917 --> 01:02:40,883
Oh! Yes, your father's right.

910
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:44,667
The celebration's the thank you
for defeating that monster.

911
01:02:44,867 --> 01:02:45,758
It would be.

912
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:47,958
I see my teachings
have paid off!

913
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,750
Now those morons get it.

914
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:52,342
About time.

915
01:02:52,542 --> 01:02:55,292
- Promise you'll be there?
- All right, fine!

916
01:03:17,042 --> 01:03:19,125
Why did you lie
about his birthday?

917
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:22,500
Believing he's the Spirit Pearl

918
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,667
has given him joy.

919
01:03:25,042 --> 01:03:26,875
If it means
he can stay that way,

920
01:03:27,075 --> 01:03:28,500
then yes, I'm going to lie.

921
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,925
Well, except...

922
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:32,542
the villagers were clear
they want to lock him up.

923
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:34,542
Why would they attend his party?

924
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,042
Let me
handle the details.

925
01:03:39,242 --> 01:03:40,008
On the beach that day,

926
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:42,708
I saw the Yaksha slime
on his hands.

927
01:03:42,908 --> 01:03:44,508
He was telling the truth.

928
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:46,708
And I will see to it
that they all learn that,

929
01:03:46,908 --> 01:03:48,083
at the celebration.

930
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:49,417
But...

931
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:52,750
When you've been commander
as long as I have,

932
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,508
many people owe you favors.

933
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:58,125
I'll get them all to attend.
You can count on that.

934
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,792
Don't worry.

935
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:23,167
What do you want?

936
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:26,958
Ah, don't scare me like that.

937
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:29,383
My birthday party's in ten days.

938
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:32,042
And everyone in the Pass
is gonna be there.

939
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:36,792
I, uh, drew you a map
so you wouldn't get lost.

940
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,675
Li Manor's renowned.

941
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:42,292
I guess.
But you're coming, aren't ya?

942
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:43,925
- Well...
- Oh, come on!

943
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:46,958
I don't care if they don't come
but you gotta be there!

944
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:48,092
Why's that?

945
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:50,625
Maybe 'cause
you're my only friend.

946
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:56,042
You're my only friend, too.

947
01:04:57,292 --> 01:04:59,000
Do you have any other wishes?

948
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:00,750
You saved my life.

949
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:03,708
So I'll do everything I can
to make them come true.

950
01:05:04,042 --> 01:05:06,092
Wishes? Eh, like I said!

951
01:05:06,292 --> 01:05:08,792
My wish is you'd come
to my party!

952
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:11,425
I'll go.

953
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:13,292
It's a deal! See you there!

954
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,108
Don't baill!

955
01:05:21,308 --> 01:05:22,375
I won't.

956
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,333
INVITATION

957
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:38,467
Ao Bing,

958
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:41,542
It's time to go.

959
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:43,417
One more thing.

960
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:51,625
Father!

961
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:00,708
Wait, what're you...

962
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,292
My son...

963
01:06:29,667 --> 01:06:32,671
Each of the dragons
has given you

964
01:06:32,871 --> 01:06:35,675
their hardest scale
for protection.

965
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:39,458
Dragonscale armor
is impenetrable.

966
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:42,792
It's all up to you now.

967
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:04,545
Huh? Why're you so sad?

968
01:07:04,745 --> 01:07:07,208
Show enthusiasm. Smile.

969
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:13,083
Why does it sound
like a funeral?

970
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,958
When does Lord Li
want us to come out?

971
01:07:22,158 --> 01:07:22,917
He'll signal.

972
01:07:23,117 --> 01:07:24,083
Oh.

973
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:32,875
Hmm.
Yeah, I'm feelin' this cape.

974
01:07:33,075 --> 01:07:35,333
Fancy!

975
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:38,708
A good shroud
for a corpse maybe.

976
01:07:38,908 --> 01:07:39,750
What?

977
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:42,675
I am your ma-mast...

978
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:44,550
Ew, gross, a demon!

979
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:47,167
Stop!

980
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:50,167
I know your master!

981
01:07:50,458 --> 01:07:51,217
So I'm a friend to you!

982
01:07:51,417 --> 01:07:53,375
Oh. Your name is
Shen something, right?

983
01:07:53,575 --> 01:07:55,217
Shen Go-go-go...

984
01:07:55,417 --> 01:07:56,592
What up, Shen Gonggong?

985
01:07:56,792 --> 01:08:00,042
Brat. It's Shen Go-go-gong-bao!

986
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:03,691
And I'm here to reveal
your true identity.

987
01:08:03,891 --> 01:08:07,208
What do you mean "true"?

988
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,050
Oh, my poor child.

989
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:13,208
You have been kept in the dark
for far too long.

990
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:20,833
And now let's bring out
the birthday boy!

991
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:33,800
Play with me!

992
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,292
Huh?

993
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:42,800
Today is your birthday,
young apprentice.

994
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,792
And let me tell you
I'm gonna spoil you rotten!

995
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:01,375
Your fire-tipped spear
and Chaotic Silk.

996
01:09:01,917 --> 01:09:03,750
They're officially yours now.

997
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:06,917
And here's the big one!

998
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:12,250
This shall serve
as your noble steed.

999
01:09:12,417 --> 01:09:14,333
Go on, touch it.

1000
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:27,608
This guy's
my most prized possession.

1001
01:09:27,808 --> 01:09:29,512
It can transform
into various mounts

1002
01:09:29,712 --> 01:09:31,417
based on the traits
of its owners.

1003
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:34,750
With you, it will take the form
of a flaming chariot!

1004
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:39,250
So why does it turn into a pig
with you then?

1005
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:40,208
Huh?

1006
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:52,167
You stinker.
Where has the time gone?

1007
01:09:52,367 --> 01:09:52,717
Just three years ago,

1008
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:55,133
you were a little meatball
in my belly.

1009
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:58,458
And now you've become a man
with a personality and...

1010
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:03,083
I so want to watch you grow up.

1011
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,833
Why are you talking like that

1012
01:10:11,033 --> 01:10:11,917
on his birthday?

1013
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:15,750
Dad got you a protection charm
to keep you safe.

1014
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:16,550
SAFE AND SOUND

1015
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:19,000
I know I've always been
hard on you,

1016
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,425
and you're angry about that.

1017
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:22,583
But I was doing
what I thought best.

1018
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,967
Now son, you have
a long life ahead.

1019
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:28,708
Do not pay any attention
to what the others say.

1020
01:10:28,908 --> 01:10:30,500
You are who you say you are.

1021
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:33,167
That's all that matters.

1022
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:35,967
I believed you.

1023
01:10:36,167 --> 01:10:38,150
But all you've done
was lie to me.

1024
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:40,333
Why are you saying that?

1025
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:42,817
Come on. The Demon Pill?

1026
01:10:43,017 --> 01:10:45,167
I know about everything.

1027
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:48,133
You said I was the Spirit Pearl.

1028
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:50,292
Put me through training
in the painting.

1029
01:10:50,492 --> 01:10:51,383
But really you were just

1030
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:53,691
keeping me locked up
until I died.

1031
01:10:53,891 --> 01:10:55,800
All to make these idiots happy!

1032
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,125
To keep your dumb reputation,
you locked me away!

1033
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:02,458
Now you're being silly.

1034
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:03,967
Don't be so dramatic.

1035
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:06,254
I mean,
look at all these people!

1036
01:11:06,454 --> 01:11:08,542
Eating, drinking, being merry.

1037
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:11,092
Why am I not surprised?

1038
01:11:11,292 --> 01:11:14,333
Fine. If you wanna
keep lying too.

1039
01:11:14,533 --> 01:11:17,592
With the power of sun and moon

1040
01:11:17,792 --> 01:11:19,625
- of sea and sand...
- Where did you learn that spell?

1041
01:11:19,825 --> 01:11:23,583
Qiankun Hoop, obey my command!

1042
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:50,917
Run away!

1043
01:11:55,042 --> 01:11:55,925
Finally...

1044
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,708
It's just you and me demon!

1045
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:35,837
Ne Zha! Stop this!

1046
01:12:36,037 --> 01:12:38,133
He's been possessed!

1047
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:40,792
The Qiankun Hoop
is our only hope!

1048
01:12:40,992 --> 01:12:41,958
Find the hoop!

1049
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:47,292
Looking for this?

1050
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:50,083
Don't waste your time.

1051
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:54,667
Only the heavenly calamity
can stop the Demon Pill.

1052
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:58,000
Once he's killed Taiyi
and his parents,

1053
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,633
go subdue Ne Zha.

1054
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:02,083
Until the lightning
destroys him.

1055
01:13:02,283 --> 01:13:03,300
And when the dust clears,

1056
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,917
the villagers will see you
as a hero.

1057
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:10,042
After all that, the Supreme Lord
will turn you into a god.

1058
01:13:10,242 --> 01:13:12,542
Your power will be limitless.

1059
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,250
Ne Zha's parents and Taiyi.

1060
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:17,875
They are all innocent.

1061
01:13:18,667 --> 01:13:20,625
It's not right.
If the hoop was still on,

1062
01:13:20,825 --> 01:13:21,800
then Ne Zha wouldn't be evil.

1063
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,504
What do you care
if he's good or evil?

1064
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:27,731
He's about to get struck
by lightning!

1065
01:13:27,931 --> 01:13:30,758
If Taiyi and his parents survive

1066
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:34,083
how will I sell our lie
to the Supreme Lord?

1067
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:42,254
Fortune didn't smile upon me
when I was born.

1068
01:13:42,454 --> 01:13:45,106
I had to fight an uphill battle
to get this far.

1069
01:13:45,306 --> 01:13:47,958
Of all the disciples, I trained
the hardest,

1070
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:49,800
never slacking.

1071
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,167
Yet continually I was passed
over for the others.

1072
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:57,000
Do... Do you know why, my child?

1073
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:58,417
No, master.

1074
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:02,250
Because he knows I was born
a lowly jaguar spirit.

1075
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:05,667
So he could care less
if I lived or died!

1076
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:10,875
To everyone else,
you and I are just monsters.

1077
01:14:10,917 --> 01:14:12,708
They could construct
an entire mountain

1078
01:14:12,908 --> 01:14:14,508
with their prejudice.

1079
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:18,875
And no matter how hard you try,
that mountain is immovable.

1080
01:14:19,075 --> 01:14:20,958
But you're being handed
a rare chance

1081
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:22,375
to change their minds.

1082
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,458
To alter your fate.

1083
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:27,917
- Master. I owe Ne Zha my life.
- Huh?

1084
01:14:28,117 --> 01:14:29,425
Maybe I can't save him

1085
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,208
but let me save his parents
and his master,

1086
01:14:32,408 --> 01:14:33,500
to repay my debt.

1087
01:14:35,792 --> 01:14:37,125
Huh?

1088
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:39,050
Go on, then.

1089
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:43,675
But if, if,
if this goes south...

1090
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:47,000
don't say I didn't warn you boy.

1091
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:51,300
If they discover what you are...

1092
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:55,833
Then I promise more than four
will meet their fate today...

1093
01:14:56,667 --> 01:14:59,000
Uh... Hey. I was talking!

1094
01:15:03,542 --> 01:15:04,792
Nope!

1095
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:15,167
Huh?

1096
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:41,458
Stop! That's your father.

1097
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:00,542
Ah, he's so cool.

1098
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,375
Hear that?
We're missing the whole party.

1099
01:16:29,575 --> 01:16:30,937
Are you sure we can't go out?

1100
01:16:31,137 --> 01:16:32,500
Lord Li said there's a signal.

1101
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,375
Oh. Oh, oh.

1102
01:16:58,625 --> 01:16:59,875
Use the Hoop!

1103
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:02,087
Sun and moon, of sea and sand,

1104
01:17:02,287 --> 01:17:04,250
Qiankun Hoop, obey my command!

1105
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:16,500
Hold!

1106
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:29,542
Ne Zha! Ne Zha!

1107
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:35,083
Dear? It's your mother.

1108
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,667
Wait!

1109
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,167
Please, wait.

1110
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,750
Thank you for your assistance
today.

1111
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:02,717
Tell me, what is your name?

1112
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:04,758
My name isn't worth knowing,
Milord.

1113
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:08,083
Nonsense, I must make a toast,
to thank you.

1114
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:10,375
I have an urgent task
I must attend to.

1115
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:13,212
I'm sorry. Let me get that.

1116
01:18:13,412 --> 01:18:15,917
No need.

1117
01:18:21,542 --> 01:18:22,175
A dragon!

1118
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:24,254
Weren't they imprisoned
in the Eastern Sea

1119
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:26,814
by the Court of Heaven?
How did he get out?

1120
01:18:27,014 --> 01:18:29,175
I knew I detected
a familiar scent on you.

1121
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:32,625
But that mark on your head
confirms my suspicions.

1122
01:18:32,825 --> 01:18:33,508
That sigil!

1123
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:36,125
So the dragons stole
the Spirit Pearl.

1124
01:18:38,042 --> 01:18:39,592
I could chase you if I wanted!

1125
01:18:39,792 --> 01:18:42,125
What else would you expect from
a bunch of dragons?

1126
01:18:42,325 --> 01:18:44,167
No wonder
your kind were locked away.

1127
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:47,592
Well, you can't cross
the dragons.

1128
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:49,625
So, the dragons
were the thieves. Figures.

1129
01:18:50,042 --> 01:18:52,583
The Court of Heaven
shouldn't have left them alive.

1130
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:56,295
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1131
01:18:56,495 --> 01:18:58,583
How unfortunate.

1132
01:18:58,875 --> 01:18:59,550
Brother?

1133
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:04,042
For this to work
only four people needed to die.

1134
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:05,175
But wouldn't you know?

1135
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:07,175
Now everyone sees what you are.

1136
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,587
Now no one
gets to su-sur... survive.

1137
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,000
Please tell me
you weren't involved.

1138
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:15,625
I'm afraid I can't.
It would be quite rude to lie.

1139
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,650
As for the Pearl, I stole it.

1140
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:21,708
And Ao Bing is my apprentice.

1141
01:19:21,792 --> 01:19:23,567
Uh, have you lost your mind?

1142
01:19:23,767 --> 01:19:25,542
I'm gonna tell the Supreme Lord!

1143
01:19:27,542 --> 01:19:29,425
Good thing
I'm one step ahead then.

1144
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:33,750
If you all die, there will be no
one left to tell him will there?

1145
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:35,092
Apprentice,

1146
01:19:35,292 --> 01:19:39,292
there's only one thing
to be done.

1147
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:42,191
The survival of your people

1148
01:19:42,391 --> 01:19:44,875
depends on the next decision.

1149
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:53,092
For the past millennium,

1150
01:19:53,292 --> 01:19:56,292
the Spirit Pearl has been
our only hope for freedom.

1151
01:19:56,492 --> 01:19:58,667
It's all up to you now.

1152
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:22,208
What is he doing?

1153
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:54,583
He's trying
to bury Chentang Pass!

1154
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:51,941
A great deal of time
has already passed.

1155
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:54,304
We should head back
as soon as possible.

1156
01:21:54,504 --> 01:21:56,667
Maybe there's something
we can do for him.

1157
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,125
You can't leave,
you just got here!

1158
01:22:03,542 --> 01:22:04,792
I'll die of loneliness!

1159
01:22:04,992 --> 01:22:05,917
You're being clingy!

1160
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:08,441
You can't break this curse

1161
01:22:08,641 --> 01:22:10,633
but there are ways around it.

1162
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:14,042
Like a transplant spell.
You thought about that?

1163
01:22:14,242 --> 01:22:15,300
Yeah, but what does he know?

1164
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,458
Are you gonna trust me
or an annoying cloud?

1165
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:21,083
I've studied with the Master
for centuries before you.

1166
01:22:21,283 --> 01:22:22,133
I know things you don't!

1167
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:24,708
Let me show you
what talent looks like.

1168
01:22:24,908 --> 01:22:26,250
Yeah, okay, airhead.

1169
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:29,125
These guys are
Fate-Swapping Runes.

1170
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:31,708
Find a relative willing to
sacrifice their life.

1171
01:22:31,908 --> 01:22:34,145
Have them put one rune
on themselves,

1172
01:22:34,345 --> 01:22:36,383
and the other
on the cursed individual.

1173
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:39,000
And then instead of him,
the relative will go boom!

1174
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:51,083
Ow.

1175
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:54,883
Woah, hey! What are you doing?

1176
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:57,792
I've decided to swap my life
for that of my son's.

1177
01:22:57,992 --> 01:22:59,750
This stays between you and me.

1178
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:01,708
I beg of you,
don't tell my wife.

1179
01:23:01,792 --> 01:23:03,342
Milord...

1180
01:23:03,542 --> 01:23:06,583
Ultimately, your sacrifice
would just go to waste.

1181
01:23:06,783 --> 01:23:08,258
The Demon Pill
will bring disaster

1182
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:11,250
and the Supreme Lord
will never let him go.

1183
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:12,467
The Demon Pill?

1184
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:14,458
I will use the remaining
two years I have left

1185
01:23:14,658 --> 01:23:15,883
to make him a warrior.

1186
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:18,042
The people shall see him
as a hero.

1187
01:23:18,242 --> 01:23:19,125
No, I can't allow it!

1188
01:23:19,325 --> 01:23:20,008
If you won't allow it,

1189
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:22,000
when the lightning strikes
during the Heavenly Calamity,

1190
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,708
I will die with Ne Zha.

1191
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:26,167
That's, that's so not fair!

1192
01:23:26,367 --> 01:23:28,125
Uh, who is Ne Zha?

1193
01:23:28,958 --> 01:23:30,750
He is my son.

1194
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,042
Stop!

1195
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:14,125
Ah!

1196
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:17,375
That's strong armor!

1197
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:18,458
Aim for the head!

1198
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:00,583
Ao Bing?

1199
01:25:00,917 --> 01:25:03,042
Don't waste your breath.

1200
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,333
Shen Gonggong?
What are you doing here?

1201
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:07,375
It's Shen Gong-Bao!

1202
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:09,958
Shen Gongbao was the one
who stole the Spirit Pearl

1203
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:11,217
and put it in Ao Bing.

1204
01:25:11,417 --> 01:25:14,333
He wants to bury Chentang Pass
and everyone in it!

1205
01:25:21,042 --> 01:25:22,375
Stop!

1206
01:25:46,917 --> 01:25:48,750
Your power is limited
by that hoop.

1207
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:49,842
You've no chance.

1208
01:25:50,042 --> 01:25:52,667
I'll kick your butt!
Hoop or no hoop!

1209
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:05,667
Don't do this.

1210
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:10,167
Ha! Too slow!

1211
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:12,750
Fine. Then I'll ice you out!

1212
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:19,292
Stop, my apprentice!

1213
01:26:23,042 --> 01:26:24,375
I'm sorry, master!

1214
01:26:24,667 --> 01:26:25,375
Ne Zha!

1215
01:26:32,208 --> 01:26:34,417
That's crazy!
What the heck are you wearing?

1216
01:26:34,617 --> 01:26:35,708
Transformation?

1217
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:41,625
Come and get me! You scared?

1218
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:45,000
Demon, there can only be
one of us.

1219
01:26:57,458 --> 01:26:58,717
) - Ah!

1220
01:26:58,917 --> 01:27:00,008
You better watch yourself!

1221
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:01,792
I was holding back
this whole time.

1222
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,292
If anyone deserves to be the
12th Golden Immortal,

1223
01:27:04,492 --> 01:27:06,958
it's me, not an incompetent
fool like you!

1224
01:27:10,417 --> 01:27:12,125
Huh?

1225
01:27:12,708 --> 01:27:15,750
Hold on. Master entrusted you
with the painting,

1226
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:16,592
not me?

1227
01:27:16,792 --> 01:27:18,625
Well, maybe he knew
you didn't deserve it!

1228
01:27:18,825 --> 01:27:20,467
Very mature of you.

1229
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:22,625
- But it's you who'll weep!
- Take that!

1230
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:34,792
Coward!

1231
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:46,542
Huh?

1232
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:49,083
Huh? Ha?

1233
01:27:54,292 --> 01:27:55,292
I've got you now!

1234
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:58,425
Stop! I am your master!

1235
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:01,750
Nice try. Next time,
pay more attention to detail.

1236
01:28:05,458 --> 01:28:07,375
Apprentice, let me help you!

1237
01:28:09,708 --> 01:28:13,833
That'll teach you!

1238
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:18,958
Great! Job well done!

1239
01:28:19,167 --> 01:28:20,417
You are too kind, Master.

1240
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,750
Thank you, apprentice!

1241
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:32,417
- Huh?
- Huh?

1242
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:33,458
Uh hey...

1243
01:28:34,792 --> 01:28:37,417
Totally nailed that! Huh?

1244
01:28:48,667 --> 01:28:50,250
No!

1245
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:06,583
- Who are you?
- Why... I'm your master!

1246
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,000
Woah it's me, Ne Zha.

1247
01:29:15,042 --> 01:29:16,383
Ooh! That's sneaky!

1248
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:17,875
Come on let's get out of here.

1249
01:29:21,083 --> 01:29:22,667
That brush is our only way out.

1250
01:29:22,708 --> 01:29:23,667
Get him!

1251
01:30:14,958 --> 01:30:16,708
Ao Bing, grab it.

1252
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,958
Hey, Ne Zha.
Grab the brush for me.

1253
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:36,050
Classy. But you can't
keep that up forever.

1254
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:40,042
I, on the other hand, will never
run out of ammunition.

1255
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:46,292
What was that you were saying?

1256
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:52,875
Good one!

1257
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:10,583
Uh, question,
where'd you learn to draw?

1258
01:31:10,783 --> 01:31:12,500
You try drawing with your feet.

1259
01:31:36,417 --> 01:31:37,167
- Huh?
- Hm?

1260
01:32:06,542 --> 01:32:08,875
- Ne Zha! Ne Zha!
- Son! Son!

1261
01:32:10,792 --> 01:32:11,750
Ah!

1262
01:32:50,042 --> 01:32:53,583
Power of sun and moon,
of sea and sand.

1263
01:32:53,783 --> 01:32:55,833
Listen up, Qiankun Hoop,

1264
01:32:56,033 --> 01:32:58,083
and obey my command!

1265
01:32:58,292 --> 01:33:01,083
Can't lose myself. Gotta focus.

1266
01:33:56,792 --> 01:33:57,675
Stop struggling.

1267
01:33:57,875 --> 01:34:00,875
You were born the Demon Pill.
Why not accept your destiny?

1268
01:34:00,958 --> 01:34:03,587
'Cause it is not the boss of me.

1269
01:34:03,787 --> 01:34:06,417
I'm the master of my destiny.

1270
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:08,733
I'll be the one who decides.

1271
01:34:08,933 --> 01:34:11,125
And I will not be a demon!

1272
01:35:08,167 --> 01:35:10,208
Huh?

1273
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:29,958
Why spare me?

1274
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:31,500
I told you.

1275
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,417
You're the only friend I have.

1276
01:35:44,417 --> 01:35:46,375
Well, my time's almost up.

1277
01:35:47,417 --> 01:35:48,583
You should leave.

1278
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:50,467
But aren't you worried I'll...

1279
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:52,217
I thought
you were the Spirit Pearl!

1280
01:35:52,417 --> 01:35:54,833
I'm the Demon Pill
and I'm braver than you?

1281
01:35:55,033 --> 01:35:56,333
Don't be such a baby!

1282
01:35:56,533 --> 01:35:57,625
I'm a monster.

1283
01:35:57,958 --> 01:36:00,333
When I was born,
my fate was sealed.

1284
01:36:00,533 --> 01:36:01,008
You're not listening.

1285
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:02,717
Your fate's
what you want it to be.

1286
01:36:02,917 --> 01:36:05,167
No one else gets to decide
what you are.

1287
01:36:05,367 --> 01:36:07,083
My father taught that to me.

1288
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:09,792
If fate comes at you swingin'...

1289
01:36:09,992 --> 01:36:11,875
then you hit back.

1290
01:36:16,417 --> 01:36:17,458
Ne Zha!

1291
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:22,167
Ne Zha! Release us!

1292
01:36:30,167 --> 01:36:32,542
I know you want to help but...

1293
01:36:32,742 --> 01:36:34,000
this is my fight.

1294
01:36:34,292 --> 01:36:36,083
Ne Zha! No!

1295
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:47,000
Huh, you know
looking back on it...

1296
01:36:47,583 --> 01:36:49,208
Three years isn't that long.

1297
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:51,792
I had fun while it lasted!

1298
01:36:56,917 --> 01:36:58,292
My only regret?

1299
01:36:58,917 --> 01:37:01,583
I never kicked
the jianzi with you, Dad.

1300
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:13,083
It's my birthday.
No crying allowed.

1301
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:20,875
Aw, man.

1302
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:35,708
Dad. Mom.

1303
01:37:40,958 --> 01:37:42,375
Thank you.

1304
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:05,958
- Ne Zha! Ne Zha!
- Ne Zha! Ne Zha!

1305
01:38:07,125 --> 01:38:08,708
Ne Zha!

1306
01:38:12,208 --> 01:38:15,000
- Ne Zha! Ne Zha!
- Ne Zha! Ne Zha!

1307
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,667
Ne Zhal!

1308
01:38:40,833 --> 01:38:41,467
Huh?

1309
01:38:41,667 --> 01:38:42,800
Are you nuts?

1310
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,750
Ao Bing, get out of there!

1311
01:38:45,208 --> 01:38:47,750
Dragonscale Armor!

1312
01:39:11,167 --> 01:39:14,375
He is ruining my entire plan!

1313
01:39:14,417 --> 01:39:16,342
I'm not done with you.

1314
01:39:16,542 --> 01:39:19,250
You've not seen
the last of me!

1315
01:39:20,417 --> 01:39:22,583
You're sacrificing yourself
for nothing.

1316
01:39:22,783 --> 01:39:23,967
You dumb or what?

1317
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:26,875
'Course I am,
I'm your friend after all.

1318
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:09,333
Huh?

1319
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:18,208
I never expected it could absorb
this amount of power.

1320
01:40:18,408 --> 01:40:21,458
The Chaos Pearl has an appetite.

1321
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:29,675
I can't take it.

1322
01:40:29,875 --> 01:40:31,792
I'm about to explode!

1323
01:40:37,458 --> 01:40:39,458
You shouldn't have to...

1324
01:40:39,658 --> 01:40:41,300
Let's give it back.

1325
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:42,792
Right!

1326
01:40:53,875 --> 01:40:56,583
I can't hold on!

1327
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:03,708
Ne Zha! No!

1328
01:41:04,083 --> 01:41:07,500
How dare they not invite me
to join in...

1329
01:41:10,375 --> 01:41:12,337
I love a good party.

1330
01:41:12,537 --> 01:41:14,500
Stay strong, you two.

1331
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:25,917
Open!

1332
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,167
Where are you? Ne Zha!

1333
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:15,167
- How are we alive?
- Hal We made it!

1334
01:42:15,208 --> 01:42:17,292
Well, not exactly...

1335
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:22,958
The Multi-colored Lotus
couldn't save your bodies...

1336
01:42:23,158 --> 01:42:24,958
but it kept your souls intact.

1337
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,275
Whereas I'm pretty sure
I blew my chance

1338
01:42:26,475 --> 01:42:27,750
at becoming
the 12th Golden Immortal.

1339
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:29,092
It cost me centuries!

1340
01:42:29,292 --> 01:42:32,958
Now I guess I gotta start over
again from scratch!

1341
01:42:33,158 --> 01:42:34,842
Thank goodness.

1342
01:42:35,042 --> 01:42:38,708
I thought
I'd never see you again!

1343
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:03,383
if you asked me

1344
01:43:03,583 --> 01:43:06,375
whether a person
can alter their fate?

1345
01:43:06,958 --> 01:43:09,333
Well, I don't really know.

1346
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:11,750
But hey, anything's possible.

1347
01:43:11,958 --> 01:43:14,125
Because a boy named Ne Zha,

1348
01:43:14,325 --> 01:43:16,125
forever changed his.

1349
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,583
A JIAOZI FILM

1350
01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:52,175
Okay,

1351
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:54,546
but, are you sure
we can't go out?

1352
01:43:54,746 --> 01:43:56,917
We, we're still waiting
on the signal!

1353
01:43:57,117 --> 01:44:00,208
So uh what exactly
is the signal?

1354
01:44:00,958 --> 01:44:02,175
You know...

1355
01:44:02,375 --> 01:44:03,458
That's a good question.

1356
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:09,550
DON'T LEAVE!

1357
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:12,250
THERE'S STILL A
POST-CREDITS SCENE!

1358
01:45:30,417 --> 01:45:32,958
Ao Bing...

1359
01:45:33,875 --> 01:45:37,917
Everything we have worked for
was laid to waste.

1360
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:43,500
And for that, I will make all
of Chentang Pass pay in blood.

1361
01:45:45,708 --> 01:45:51,342
Louder,

1362
01:45:51,542 --> 01:45:53,133
I don't think they can hear you!

1363
01:45:53,333 --> 01:45:54,708
Screaming into the void
like a child

1364
01:45:54,908 --> 01:45:56,333
won't change a thing.

1365
01:45:58,125 --> 01:46:00,042
We trusted you
to secure our freedom,

1366
01:46:00,242 --> 01:46:02,125
and you failed us!

1367
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:08,417
Would you like to make a deal?

1368
01:46:08,617 --> 01:46:10,708
Dear brother?

1369
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:16,717
DON'T YOU DARE LEAVE!

1370
01:46:16,917 --> 01:46:18,583
THERE IS STILL A
POST-CREDIT SCENE TO SEE

1371
01:49:21,208 --> 01:49:22,958
Jiang Ziya...

1372
01:49:27,292 --> 01:49:29,167
You know your sin.

1373
01:49:29,367 --> 01:49:33,208
JIANG ZIYA

1374
01:49:33,583 --> 01:49:37,250
