Nice security.

139
00:14:29,976 --> 00:14:31,762
Its the country,
everybody trusts everybody.
那是乡下 夜不闭户

140
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,011
Isn't this guy, Bob, from Boston?
-Oh whatever.
那个鲍勃不是吧 他来自波士顿
没关系

141
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:36,872
I'm sure the repairs
just took longer than he thought.
我想翻修工作只是比他想的久了点

Where are we going to meet him?

What's that supposed to mean?

155
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:07,456
You should have seen your face just now
when he said we were meeting Doug.
你应该看看他说我们要去见道格时 你脸上的表情

156
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:09,264
It lit up like a Christmas tree.
笑意盎然 容光焕发

157
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:10,967
I don't know what you
are talking about.
我不知道你在说什么

I just haven't seen him
in a while that's all.
我只是很久没见他了

You know.

man-crush on Doug, you can say it.

Fuck off both of you.
Look...
你们都给我闭嘴

169
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:37,353
I don't even like going in the locker room
when other men are changing.

Why?
为什么

因为他们总喜欢在没穿衣服的时候 跟我聊天

177
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,415
-So what's wrong with that?
那又怎么了

There are few things
in this world,

more uncomfortable than a

You know what I mean.

and I don't think I want to know.
不 我不懂 我也不认为我想懂

I never have a problem with that.
那可真有意思 我从来不会觉得那算问题

189
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:21,415
Well that's because you can't
be on your knees at the time.
那是因为那东西不会撞你膝盖上

190
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,573
Son of a...

going to be here this weekend.

No asshole,

You should see the
way she treats him.

and she doesn't appreciate it.
他把她照顾得无微不至 她却不懂感激

不仅如此 她还毫无幽默感

together for...what?

00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,365
So...where we going?
那 我们要去哪儿

272
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,134
We're going up 95 until
we get to The Forks,
我们要沿着95号大道开到福克斯

273
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,877
then we're going to cross over to
Route 18 for about a half an hour,
然后是沿着18号公路一个半小时的车程

274
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:53,673
and then after that
its a small road I guess,
这之后 我猜还有条小路要开

275
00:19:53,698 --> 00:19:56,467
a US Lyons road,
for another half a mile.
到US里昂路 又是半英里

276
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,908
Jesus, its certainly off the beaten path.
真是不走寻常路

277
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,747
You said you wanted secluded.
你说过你喜欢隐秘小路

278
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,512
True!
Alright, I love it .
没错 我喜欢

279
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:03,744
Let's go.
我们走吧

280
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:52,384
I know isn't that wild?
那没那么荒凉

281
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:54,623
You're making that up.
- I swear I'm not.
你在开玩笑
我发誓我没有

282
00:20:57,865 --> 00:20:58,865
Where are we?
我们到哪儿了

283
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:02,341
We're a few hours into Maine.
We're about to hit 18.
我们已经在缅因州开了几个小时的车
大概快到18号公路

284
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
I'm hungry.
我饿了

285
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,662
Yeah, me too.
我也是

286
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,454
You hungry?
- No, but I'm thirsty.
你们饿了
我渴了

287
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:09,631
Alright, well, we're still
about an hour or so away,
好吧 我们至少还有一小时的路

288
00:21:09,656 --> 00:21:11,133
so we should
probably stop here.
在这里停一会儿

289
00:21:11,158 --> 00:21:13,195
Looks like there's a
convenience store up ahead.
看上去前面有家便利店

290
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,579
How's that?
- Good.
怎么样
好的

291
00:21:14,743 --> 00:21:15,781
Is Doug still behind us?
道格还跟在我们后面吗

292
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,037
Yup.
是的

293
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:19,134
Can't you sense his presence?
你难道感受不到他的存在

294
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:24,435
I refuse to take part in your petty jibes.
我不想跟你抬杠

295
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,488
You want anything?
-No I'm good.
你要什么
不用了

296
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:43,901
Holy shit!
该死

297
00:21:44,612 --> 00:21:45,612
What?
怎么了

298
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,155
What do you mean "what "?
Look at the name.
你说怎么了 看这个招牌

299
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,845
I don't understand, "Voorhees Market".
我不懂 沃里斯超市

300
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:56,327
So?
所以呢

301
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,260
So, the name "Voorhees"
means nothing to you?
所以 沃里斯对你没有意义吗

302
00:21:59,288 --> 00:22:00,288
Should it?
应该有吗

303
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,488
Never mind.
没事了

304
00:22:04,832 --> 00:22:05,832
Go ahead.
走吧

305
00:22:21,102 --> 00:22:22,102
Hey.
嘿

306
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:24,551
You see the name on the store?
你看到这家店的店名吗

307
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,103
Yeah, we totally got to get a
picture of that before we go.
是的 我们走之前应该拍张照

308
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:28,314
I know, right?
我知道的

309
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:29,886
That's all I'm saying.
我就这么想的

310
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:30,934
What's up?
怎么了

311
00:22:34,447 --> 00:22:35,447
Ellie sucks!
艾莉糟透了

312
00:22:35,713 --> 00:22:36,750
Quit being a baby!
别那么幼稚

313
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,215
I'm not being a baby.
不是我幼稚

314
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:43,608
Now I shall go get some ice cream.
我去买一些冰淇淋

315
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:48,009
Sweet Christ,
they have pixie sticks.
太好了 他们有仙女棒

316
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,183
Get the fuck out.
真棒

317
00:22:49,526 --> 00:22:52,059
They also have 24 foot licorice whips.
他们还有24英尺的甘草鞭

318
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:53,857
We've hit the mother load.
我的妈啊

319
00:22:53,882 --> 00:22:55,043
What about the chocolate?
有巧克力吗

320
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:56,068
I didn't check.
我没看

321
00:22:57,646 --> 00:22:58,646
You disgust me.
你真是的

00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:01,752
There's much you've yet to learn.
Excuse me.
你还有得学 让一下

323
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,247
So, where you folks from?
你们从哪儿来

324
00:23:14,372 --> 00:23:17,172
We just moved back to Mass, from New York.
我们刚从纽约来马斯

325
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:20,028
So then you're Red Sox fans.

You are aren't you?

Where you headed?

00:23:28,561 --> 00:23:31,404
Up to The Forks.
We got a cabin out there.
到福克斯 我们在那儿租了间小屋

330
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,460
That's nice.

331
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:34,402
Should be a beautiful weekend.
周末愉快

332
00:23:34,457 --> 00:23:35,857
That'll be six bucks.
总共六美元

333
00:23:37,113 --> 00:23:39,808
So, uh...
where abouts is this cabin?
那座小屋在哪儿

334
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:42,027
Excuse me?
什么

335
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:44,034
This cabin you rented.
Where is it?
你们租的小屋 在哪里

336
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:47,874
Its off of Route 18, US Lyons road.
它在18号公路尽头 US里昂路

337
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:49,239
You know it?
你知道它

338
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:50,645
I do.
我知道

339
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,098
Family came in here, on their
way out there, last week.
上周有一家人在去那儿的途中来过这里

340
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:54,034
Nice folks.
很不错的一家人

341
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,644
That must have been Bob, the owner.
The guy who fixed it up.
那应该是屋主鲍勃  他刚翻修了小屋

342
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,288
There was some delays
with the work,
那儿的翻修工作有延误

343
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,949
he went up there to finish it.
他自己去翻修了

344
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,595
Its a little light to call it a delay,
don't you think?
称之为延误有点太轻巧了 你说呢

345
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:06,367
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Why, what would you call it?
不好意思 我不明白 你为什么那么说

346
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:09,228
I'd say some workers went missing.
There's your delay.
你所谓的延误 指的是一群工人的失踪

347
00:24:09,705 --> 00:24:10,705
Missing?
失踪

348
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,966
They were there one moment,
gone the next.
他们一起去的 然后消失了

349
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:15,945
How do grown men, go missing?
一群成年男人 怎么会失踪

350
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:19,230
They're probably going off
into the woods to take a piss.
他们也许去树林里小便

351
00:24:19,255 --> 00:24:20,518
Just got lost.
迷路了

352
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:24,002
Around here that can happen?
那里会发生这种事吗

353
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:27,510
These woods are tough to navigate,
even for us locals.
即使是当地人 也会在这片树林里迷路

354
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:28,565
Its tricky.
它挺棘手的

355
00:24:28,992 --> 00:24:32,851
You get spun around,
and everything starts looking the same...
转一圈 周围一切看上去都一样

356
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:34,893
and the direction you thought
you were going in
你走的方向

357
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:37,628
turns out to be not the
direction you were going in.
不是你要去的方向

358
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:41,799
Its tough for us locals here,
but these guys were from out of state.
当地人都这样 别说那群外来的了

359
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,247
Its much harder for them.
对他们来说更难了

360
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:45,610
Did they ever find the guys?
他们后来被找到吗

361
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:48,951
Unfortunately, Miss, they didn't.
很不幸 小姐 他们没有

362
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,816
Keep that in mind.
记住

363
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:52,769
Don't go wandering too
far from the cabin.
别离开小屋太远

364
00:24:52,794 --> 00:24:54,456
Unless there's a
trail or something.
除非有条路还是什么的

365
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:55,527
Alright?
好吗

366
00:24:56,636 --> 00:24:58,037
We won't.
Thanks.
我们不会的 谢谢

367
00:24:58,513 --> 00:24:59,525
Need a bag for this?
要袋子装吗

368
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,550
No, I'm good.
不用了

369
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:02,745
You folks have a good time.
祝你们愉快

370
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,155
I didn't mean to get
you upset or anything.
我不是故意要扫你们的兴

371
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:08,156
Sometimes I can't keep my trap shut.
有事我管不住自己的嘴

372
00:25:08,749 --> 00:25:10,482
Its ok.
Have a good night
没关系 晚上好

373
00:25:38,762 --> 00:25:40,895
Should be around here somewhere.
应该就在这儿附近

374
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,285
Wait, stop!
等一下 停车

375
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,340
What!
怎么了

376
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:47,606
There it is.
在那儿

377
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:53,315
Some co-pilot you are.
你是副驾驶

378
00:25:58,462 --> 00:25:59,995
I wonder how far it is.
我想知道还有多远

379
00:26:48,286 --> 00:26:49,464
This is amazing!
太神奇了

380
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:51,654
I can't believe how
secluded this place is.
我不敢相信这里居然这么隐蔽

381
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,700
Isn't it great?
太棒了

382
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,100
Pure nature.
纯天然

383
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:55,366
Its beautiful.
太美了

384
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:58,349
This is a nightmare.
- What?
真是场噩梦
怎么了

385
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:01,190
I've seen entirely too many horror
movies to be in a place like this.
我看过太多恐怖片都是这样的场景

386
00:27:01,215 --> 00:27:02,222
Weren't you the one who-
你又不是

387
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:03,269
OH SHIT!
哦 见鬼

388
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:10,498
Shit.
见鬼

389
00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:33,956
Well there's no damage
done to my car, so...
我的车没撞坏

390
00:27:33,981 --> 00:27:35,168
no harm done.
一切平安

391
00:27:38,677 --> 00:27:39,877
Other than this...
除此之外

00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:42,832
OH SHIT ITS ALIVE!
哦 见鬼 它还活着

393
00:27:42,864 --> 00:27:44,931
Jesus Christ!
-Its like a super deer!
上帝 它是头超级鹿

394
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,690
Maybe we should kill it.
也许我们该杀了它

395
00:27:50,394 --> 00:27:51,574
Put it out of its misery.
解除它的痛苦

396
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,640
Go for it.
去做吧

397
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:54,548
Nice. Way to throw me under the bus.
你卖我卖得还真痛快

398
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:57,902
Seems fitting, seeing as though you're
the one who threw Bambi under the car.
你最合适 谁让小鹿斑比是你撞的

399
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:58,927
Good point.
这理由好

400
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:01,488
Well, what should we do?
我们该做什么

401
00:28:02,142 --> 00:28:03,907
We could drag it off
to the side of the road,
我们要把它拖到路边

402
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,321
and let nature take its course.
尘归尘 土归土

403
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:07,488
What if we run over it again?
我们开车碾过去怎么样

404
00:28:07,526 --> 00:28:10,050
I don’t want to get deer
bits stuck under my car.
我可不想再让鹿撞到我车下

405
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:12,957
You could beat it with a stick.
- You people are savages!
你可以用棍子打它
你们这群野蛮人

406
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:20,217
Grab its legs! Fucking grab it!
抓住它的腿 抓住

407
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,685
I can't stay with those people.
They are monsters!
我受不了那些家伙 他们是怪物

408
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,749
Listen, I understand what you are saying,
but they're good people.
听着 我能理解你说的 但他们是好人

409

administer the death penalty to a deer.

a good time.

You know what?

Its midnight.
No one's coming.
都半夜了 没人来

00:47:20,564 --> 00:47:22,631
Its been really quiet actually.
很安静

680
00:47:22,837 --> 00:47:24,415
You see the tires on that car?
你看见那车的轮胎吗

681
00:47:24,486 --> 00:47:26,153
I told you, they're flat.
我告诉过你 它们瘪了

682
00:47:26,438 --> 00:47:29,438
They're not just flat,
those are ripped apart.
不只是瘪 是撕裂的

683
00:47:29,728 --> 00:47:31,602
What do you think
could have done that?
你认为是什么造成的

684
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:32,642
I don't know.
我不知道

685
00:47:34,243 --> 00:47:36,776
Its too messy to be a knife puncture but...
很像是乱刀刺穿的 但是

686
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:40,983
I can't imagine all four
tires blowing out at once.
我很难想象四个轮胎一起爆

687
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,535
I got to say man, things are
really starting to pile up.
感觉怪事越来越多

688
00:47:43,568 --> 00:47:46,488
I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation for all of this stuff.
万事都有解释

689
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:47,950
Like what?
比如呢

690
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:50,739
I mean...
我的意思是

691
00:47:53,692 --> 00:47:55,668
I guess the car could be Bob's,
我猜车可能是鲍勃的

692
00:47:56,028 --> 00:47:58,253
maybe they couldn't find a place
to fix the tires,
他们可能没找到修轮胎的地方

693
00:47:58,278 --> 00:48:00,161
so they left it here?
所以他们把车留在这儿

694
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:01,208
See?
这不就得了

695
00:48:02,356 --> 00:48:04,623
Yeah but then how did he get home?
是的 但他们是怎么回去的

696
00:48:05,645 --> 00:48:07,712
Maybe they brought a spare car?
也许他们还有一辆备用车

697
00:48:08,794 --> 00:48:11,702
Who brings a spare car anywhere?
Its not like a toothbrush!
谁会到哪儿都带着备用车
又不是牙刷

698
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:15,887
Six Flags, two years ago. We brought a
spare car in case any of us got lucky.
两年前 六旗游乐园
我们就带了备用车以防我们走运

699
00:48:15,912 --> 00:48:19,077
That way we wouldn't have to have
that awkward ride home conversation.
避免了我们骑车回家的尴尬

700
00:48:19,124 --> 00:48:21,652
Alright that was your idea,
I didn't want to do it.
那是你认为的 我没那么想

701
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:26,292
Who thinks they are going to get
lucky at an amusement park?
谁会想到在一个游乐场里能那么幸运

702
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:27,602
Its the best time.
真是好时光

703
00:48:29,082 --> 00:48:31,415
They're all off guard, its perfect.
她们措手不及 完美

704
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,251
Its amazing you're still single.
最惊人的是 你居然还单身

705
00:48:35,836 --> 00:48:37,769
I don't like to be tied down.
我不想被绑住

706
00:48:38,032 --> 00:48:39,299
No encumbrances...
无儿女的拖累

707
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,311
I'm sure that's it.
确实

708
00:48:49,669 --> 00:48:51,591
Hey is Claire still in the basement?
嘿 克莱尔还在地下室吗

709
00:48:51,685 --> 00:48:52,685
Yeah.
是的

710
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:57,182
What's going on with that anyway?
这到底怎么回事

711
00:48:58,302 --> 00:48:59,435
What do you mean?
什么意思

712
00:48:59,818 --> 00:49:02,924
Don't play games with me, buttercup,
you know exactly what I mean.
别耍我 你知道我在说什么

713
00:49:02,949 --> 00:49:04,802
You two have been
awfully chatty lately.
你俩最近话不少

714
00:49:05,811 --> 00:49:07,709
You're imagining things.
We're always chatty.
你瞎想什么 我们一直很多话

715
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:10,200
No! On the ride up here you
two were like Amos and Andy,
不 在来这儿的路上 
你们就像是先知安迪

716
00:49:10,225 --> 00:49:11,748
though neither of you were black.
虽然你们都不是黑人

717
00:49:12,225 --> 00:49:14,771
First off, those guys are...
首先 那些家伙是

718
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:15,958
guys.
你懂的

719
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:19,958
Second of all...we're the
same we've always been.
第二 我们一直如此

720
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:22,906
You really going to throw
this company line at me?
你真的要用场面话堵我

721
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:26,000
Tell me you never thought
about getting with her.
别告诉我你没想和她在一起过

722
00:49:28,204 --> 00:49:29,766
Ok, well, admittedly...
哦 好吧 我不否认

723
00:49:30,446 --> 00:49:33,531
I have thought about it
from time to time, but...
我有时考虑过 但

724
00:49:33,665 --> 00:49:36,665
we've been friends for what now?
Seven years?
我们当了多久的朋友 七年

725
00:49:37,758 --> 00:49:40,406
I'm not sure I'm ready to be
in a long term relationship,
我不确定 如果我们在一起了

726
00:49:40,431 --> 00:49:42,485
which is what it would
be if we got together.
能否维持比友谊更长久的感情

727
00:49:42,516 --> 00:49:43,883
It wouldn't have to be.
想多了

728
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:44,938
Oh please...
哦 得了

729
00:49:45,386 --> 00:49:47,853
Long term friends don't just hook up.
长时间的友谊并不容易

730
00:49:47,948 --> 00:49:50,205
The "getting to know you"
phase is over,
认识你 这一阶段结束

731
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,556
and when that happens,
you're in it for the long haul.
你会发现 这才只是漫漫长路的开始

732
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:54,370
Besides...
除非

733
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:58,870
Getting together for the purely physical
would totally wreck the friendship.
在一起只是为了肉欲 不然会伤害友谊

734
00:49:58,964 --> 00:50:00,034
I can't have that.
我不想那样

735
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:03,831
I won't.
我不会的

736
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:07,143
She turned you down, didn't she?
她拒绝你了吗

737
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,768
Yeah and she was totally
mean about it too!
是的 但她就是那么想的

738
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,003
What did she say?
她说了什么

739
00:50:11,214 --> 00:50:14,658
I don't know. Something about
some guy she likes at work.
不知道 有时会说她在工作上喜欢的人

740
00:50:14,674 --> 00:50:16,393
There's nothing you
can do about that.
你拿她没办法

741
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,471
I guess not.
我猜不是

742
00:50:19,362 --> 00:50:21,495
You know what the worst part is?
你知道最糟的是什么

743
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,444
Is that I know the guy.
I mean, I don't "know" him,
是我知道那家伙
我的意思是 我虽然不认识他

744
00:50:24,469 --> 00:50:26,227
but I know the guy
she talking about.
但我知道她说的那家伙

745
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:27,321
So what?
什么

746
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:32,436
He's got a mustache...
他留着胡子

747
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,366
You mean like a goatee?
山羊胡吗

748
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:42,044
Like a Fu Manchu?
傅满洲那样的吗

749
00:50:43,137 --> 00:50:46,412
Like,a...beard, like...a...a chinstrap?
络腮胡吗 连着鬓角的胡子吗

750
00:50:47,865 --> 00:50:48,865
Nope.
不是

751
00:50:49,232 --> 00:50:50,232
Mustache...
八字胡

752
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:59,048
You got passed over for
a guy with a justasche?
你输给了一个八字胡吗

753
00:51:00,911 --> 00:51:03,178
Yup!
Not exactly a shining moment.
是的 虽然不愿承认

754
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,874
That had to bum you off.
那样的打败了你

755
00:51:05,914 --> 00:51:06,914
Dude, fuck her!
兄弟 上了她

756
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Seriously.
真的

757
00:51:09,023 --> 00:51:11,483
I mean... I love Claire like a sister,
she's awesome,
我是说 我把克莱尔当姐妹 她极好

758
00:51:11,508 --> 00:51:14,247
but if she can't see all this?
Fuck her!
但是如果她拎不清 上了她

759
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,472
Thank you Dr Drew.
谢谢你 德鲁博士

760
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,334
That's what I'm here for.
那就是为什么我来这儿

761
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:20,409
Now if only I could
be as happy as you are,
如果我能像你一样快乐

762
00:51:20,434 --> 00:51:23,372
beating off to internet porn with
a vibrator strapped to my nuts.
克制住肉体的欲望

763
00:51:23,397 --> 00:51:26,320
I'd have the zen like existence you have.
像你一样苦修

764
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,374
Amen.
阿门

765
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:20,512
Holy fuck woman!
该死的女人

766
00:54:20,692 --> 00:54:22,732
You trying to scare the
shit right out of me?
你想吓死我吗

767
00:54:22,764 --> 00:54:25,646
Sorry. I was downstairs
looking at some old photos.
抱歉 我刚才在楼下看到些旧照片

768
00:54:25,717 --> 00:54:28,117
Kind of freaked me out a little bit.
有点吓到了

769
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:33,384
Well, didn't you go down
there because it was freaky?
你不就是想找刺激下楼的吗

770
00:54:34,429 --> 00:54:35,429
Yes.
是的

771
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,697
Whatever, what did you find?
算了 你发现了什么

772
00:54:47,182 --> 00:54:50,822
Just some old stuff from the family
that apparently used to live here.
以前住在这里的一家人的旧东西

773
00:54:51,494 --> 00:54:52,494

774
00:54:53,611 --> 00:54:54,611
Furniture...
家具

775
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,697
old photos.  Stuff like that.
老照片之类的

776
00:54:57,025 --> 00:55:01,092
I'm not sure why its still
down there but, its creepy.
我不明白为什么这些还在楼下 
但是有点吓人

777
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,937
I don't know.
我不知道

778
00:55:02,962 --> 00:55:05,376
The place was empty for
years before Bob bought it.
这地方空置了很多年
直到鲍勃买下了它

779
00:55:06,915 --> 00:55:09,675
Were you or Dan hanging
around outside the basement?
是你还是丹刚才在地下室附近转悠

780
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,700
Huh?
哈

781
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:12,559
No.
I mean...
没有

782
00:55:13,551 --> 00:55:16,402
We were out on the porch just
checking out the view, why?

Nothing...
没事

787
00:55:27,749 --> 00:55:29,296
Speaking of Bob, any luck?
说到鲍勃 有什么好消息

788
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:30,382
Nope.
没

789
00:55:30,445 --> 00:55:31,445
Shit!
见鬼

790
00:55:32,242 --> 00:55:33,655
Doug and Ellie aren't back yet?
道格和艾莉还没回来吗

No.
没

792
00:55:35,023 --> 00:55:38,227
But I bet Ellie's going to keep
Doug away for as long as possible.
我打赌艾莉想带着道格离我们远远地

793
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:39,296
Dan will be upset.
丹会不高兴的

794
00:55:39,321 --> 00:55:40,321
I know.
我懂

795
00:55:40,477 --> 00:55:41,744
You coming outside?
你出来吗

796
00:55:42,893 --> 00:55:43,916
Sure, I'll join you.

beer when you come?
好的 来的时候拿瓶酒

798
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,925
I thought you came in to do that?
我以为你进来就是拿酒的

799
00:55:48,995 --> 00:55:51,995
Yeah but you're so much
closer to the fridge.
是的 但你离冰箱近

800
00:55:55,912 --> 00:55:58,826
Ugh...fine!
Bunch of babies!
噢 好吧 懒鬼

801
00:56:16,632 --> 00:56:19,753
I'm getting a little worried that
Doug and Ellie aren't back yet.
我有点担心 道格和艾莉还没回来

802
00:56:19,778 --> 00:56:21,061
I'm sure they're fine.
他们没事的

803
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:25,286
Yeah they probably just got caught
up in all the beauty that is nature.
也许是他们沉醉于大自然的美景了

804
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:27,425
I guess so....
也许吧

805
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:30,595
I just saw something outside!
我刚才看到外面有东西

806
00:57:30,998 --> 00:57:32,716
Like the darkness?
-No, asshole!
像是黑影
不 混蛋

807
00:57:32,803 --> 00:57:34,961
I just saw someone or something outside!
我真的看到有什么人或什么东西在外面

808
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,640
Ok, which was it?
Are we talking about a person or animal?
哦 那是什么呢 是一个人还是动物

809
00:57:37,665 --> 00:57:39,133
A person...I think.
一个人 我想

810
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:43,949
Once again, I have seen entirely too many
horror films to go down this road.
再说一次 我已经看了很多这种套路的恐怖片

811
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:48,120
So if you could stop talking like this, it
would really help in not freaking me out.
如果你们还要讨论下去
我吓得会受不了的

812
00:57:48,183 --> 00:57:49,250
I'm not kidding.
我不是开玩笑

813
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:53,392
Well, maybe it was Doug or Ellie
coming back from their hike.
也许是道格或者艾莉徒步回来了

I just can't!
我不能

我向你保证 我向你保证

1154

明天 谁在乎明天 你怎么知道他不会

1155
01:19:41,072 --> 01:19:44,285
come in here in the middle of the night
and kill us all? What fucking tomorrow!?
在今夜来这里杀了我们所有人 见鬼的明天

Listen Ted...

women on your hands.

What are you talking about?

1176
01:23:03,776 --> 01:23:06,309
I don't know how much more I can take.
我不知道我还能坚持多久

1177
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,641
Everything happened so fast
with Ellie and Lisa,
艾莉和丽萨的事发生得太突然了

1178
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:12,102
I didn't have a chance
to think about it.
我没机会好好想想

1179
01:23:12,603 --> 01:23:15,402
But I sure have
thought about this.
但我要好好想想

1180
01:23:17,401 --> 01:23:19,268
I don't know if I can do it.
我不知道我是否能负荷

1181
01:23:21,612 --> 01:23:22,612
Its too much.
发生了太多事情了

1182
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:28,258
I don't know if I can put together the idea
of going to hunt for a man

1183
01:23:28,283 --> 01:23:30,816
who may have taken my friend hostage.

1184
01:23:31,564 --> 01:23:32,631
Or even worse...

1185
01:23:35,275 --> 01:23:36,875
How do you deal with it?

1186
01:23:41,024 --> 01:23:42,024
I don't know.

1187
01:23:42,313 --> 01:23:45,297
I mean, I guess I can't
really deal with that either.

1188
01:23:45,485 --> 01:23:47,018
I'm just trying not to.

1189
01:23:49,217 --> 01:23:55,017
I'm sure at some point I'm going to lose my
shit,but I just keep pushing that time off.

1190
01:23:56,319 --> 01:23:58,052
I'm just trying to get by.

1191
01:23:59,140 --> 01:23:59,936
It is what it-

1192
01:23:59,961 --> 01:24:02,294
Please don't say "It is what it is"

1193
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:05,887
That is the biggest cop out in the
English language.

1194
01:24:05,912 --> 01:24:10,915
Its supposed to be so insightful,
but it just makes everything seem hollow.

1195
01:24:11,528 --> 01:24:12,528
Fair enough.

1196
01:24:13,995 --> 01:24:16,195
But I think you know what I mean.

1197
01:24:19,823 --> 01:24:20,823
I do.

1198
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:23,510
Thanks Ted.

1199
01:24:26,247 --> 01:24:27,247
You're welcome.

1200
01:24:30,575 --> 01:24:31,975
All I know is that...

1201
01:24:32,223 --> 01:24:34,501
If I have to do anymore fucked
up shit this weekend,

1202
01:24:34,526 --> 01:24:38,665
I'm seriously going to reconsider
my camping plans for next year.

1203
01:24:45,089 --> 01:24:46,289
Aren't you scared?

1204
01:24:48,949 --> 01:24:49,949
Shitless.

1205
01:24:52,024 --> 01:24:53,024
I'm no hero.

1206
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:56,652
I don't want to do this
anymore than you do.

1207
01:24:57,477 --> 01:24:59,477
But its the right thing to do.

1208
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:05,516
I know.

1209
01:25:23,385 --> 01:25:24,585
You get any sleep?

1210
01:25:26,111 --> 01:25:29,619
No.
The chair upstairs is really uncomfortable.

1211
01:25:29,893 --> 01:25:32,160
All I got out of it was stiffness.

1212
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:36,064
Well, why don't you go into a
bed and get some real sleep?

1213
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,367
I'll stay up for a bit.

1214
01:25:40,794 --> 01:25:41,794
Alright.

1215
01:25:42,255 --> 01:25:43,522
Sounds like a deal.

1216
01:25:44,544 --> 01:25:47,344
If you don't mind though I'll use your bed.

1217
01:25:47,849 --> 01:25:49,861
It took Ellie forever to
get to sleep,

1218
01:25:49,886 --> 01:25:52,727
and I don't want to wake her up.
She really needs it right now.

1219
01:25:52,752 --> 01:25:54,179
No problem.
-Ok.

1220
01:25:59,425 --> 01:26:01,839
I should probably check on her
before I go to bed.

1221
01:26:01,872 --> 01:26:02,900
I'll do it.

1222
01:26:02,925 --> 01:26:04,088
Yeah?
-Yeah.

1223
01:26:04,113 --> 01:26:05,113
Just go to bed.

1224
01:26:05,925 --> 01:26:06,925
Ok.

1225
01:26:10,534 --> 01:26:11,534
What about you?

1226
01:26:11,836 --> 01:26:12,836
I'm tired but,

1227
01:26:13,671 --> 01:26:15,866
I think I would rather sleep
in the chair down here.

1228
01:26:15,953 --> 01:26:16,953
Ok.

1229
01:26:18,367 --> 01:26:19,796
Wake me up in a few hours?

1230
01:26:19,882 --> 01:26:20,882
Sure.

1231
01:27:46,462 --> 01:27:47,462
Ted?

1232
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:45,460
Holy shit!

1233
01:29:55,518 --> 01:29:56,718
Dan, what's wrong?

1234
01:31:12,712 --> 01:31:13,779
Come on, fucker!

1235
01:32:56,415 --> 01:32:57,415
What?

1236
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:04,805
He got Ellie!

1237
01:34:06,992 --> 01:34:08,228
Do you know where he is?
-I-

1238
01:34:08,253 --> 01:34:09,267
Do not fuck with me!

1239
01:34:09,292 --> 01:34:11,117
I know the trail that
Ellie was talking about.

1240
01:34:11,142 --> 01:34:13,018
If I take you back there,
can you find his hut?

1241
01:34:13,043 --> 01:34:14,123
I think so, maybe.

1242
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:16,010
No fucking maybes!
Yes, or no!

1243
01:34:16,035 --> 01:34:16,950
Yes.

1244
01:34:16,982 --> 01:34:19,256
Let me tell you something.
It is fucking punt time.

1245
01:34:19,281 --> 01:34:21,646
I want you to get anything you can
use as a weapon.

1246
01:34:21,671 --> 01:34:24,725
We are going to find that son of a bitch
and get Ellie back. You got it?!

1247
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:25,960
Yes.

1248
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:27,790
Good.

1249
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:16,140
Stay here, I'll be right back.

1250
01:35:56,746 --> 01:35:58,746
Do you know where that gun is?

1251
01:36:05,465 --> 01:36:06,465
I don't know.

1252
01:36:07,176 --> 01:36:09,976
It wasn't there, when you were here before?

1253
01:36:10,699 --> 01:36:11,699
No.

1254
01:36:12,269 --> 01:36:13,269
Shit.

1255
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:26,880
Lisa.

1256
01:36:32,638 --> 01:36:34,305
I'm sorry about all this.

1257
01:36:35,945 --> 01:36:39,545
Its going to be a bit of a
hike up through that trail.

1258
01:36:40,687 --> 01:36:41,820
How's your ankle?

1259
01:36:44,255 --> 01:36:45,255
Its ok.

1260
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:49,126
Let's just do what we have to do.

1261
01:37:06,845 --> 01:37:08,045
Let's go this way.

1262
01:38:13,886 --> 01:38:15,534
What's wrong? Is it your ankle?

1263
01:38:15,566 --> 01:38:16,833
That hurts but, no.

1264
01:38:19,284 --> 01:38:20,284
We're close.

1265
01:38:21,409 --> 01:38:22,742
This looks familiar.

1266
01:38:41,111 --> 01:38:42,126
Holy shit!

1267
01:38:44,833 --> 01:38:45,833
I can't go.

1268
01:38:45,931 --> 01:38:46,931
What?

1269
01:38:46,978 --> 01:38:50,071
I thought I could do this,
but I can't go in there.

1270
01:38:50,244 --> 01:38:51,830
You have to, there's no other way.

1271
01:38:51,855 --> 01:38:54,799
I'm sorry, but I can't. There is no way
with what I had to do to get out.

1272
01:38:54,824 --> 01:38:56,680
I can never
go back inside that place.

1273
01:38:56,974 --> 01:38:59,849
Think about what he did to you.
Your family!

1274
01:39:00,358 --> 01:39:01,358
I need you!

1275
01:39:01,834 --> 01:39:03,042
You don't need me.

1276
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:05,240
I'll stay here and keep watch.
-What!

1277
01:39:05,631 --> 01:39:09,289
Look my ankle is on fire, I wouldn't be
able to make back up to that hut anyway.

1278
01:39:09,314 --> 01:39:12,023
So I'll stay here and keep a
look out in case he comes back.

1279
01:39:12,258 --> 01:39:13,843
And what if he's already in there?

1280
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:16,343
Well, then I'm of no use
to you inside anyway.

1281
01:39:16,555 --> 01:39:17,822
Bring him out here.

1282
01:39:18,016 --> 01:39:20,335
Its not safe out here!
-I'll be fine.

1283
01:39:20,711 --> 01:39:22,795
I will signal you if he comes through here.

1284
01:39:22,873 --> 01:39:23,873
How?

1285
01:39:24,162 --> 01:39:26,095
I'll scream as loud as I can.

1286
01:39:28,522 --> 01:39:30,334
Then he's going to come right after you.

1287
01:39:30,342 --> 01:39:32,465
Well, at the very least,
it will take his attention

1288
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:34,689
away from the hut and
you can surprise him.

1289
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:37,515
Promise me Ted, you'll
come running if I scream.

1290
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,685
I promise...

1291
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:41,433
but I don't like this idea.

1292
01:39:42,461 --> 01:39:43,794
Its all I have.

1293
01:39:47,168 --> 01:39:48,168
This is insane!

1294
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,847
Hold on, I'll be right back.

1295
01:40:34,063 --> 01:40:35,196
[WHISPER]
Ellie.

1296
01:40:36,407 --> 01:40:37,407
[WHISPER]
Ellie.

1297
01:40:38,337 --> 01:40:39,470
[WHISPER]
Ellie!

1298
01:40:45,879 --> 01:40:48,212
Ok, he's not there and I see Ellie.

1299
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:49,840
Is she alive?

1300
01:40:50,473 --> 01:40:52,210
I think so, but she's unconscious.

1301
01:40:52,546 --> 01:40:55,710
Get out of sight, and only scream
if he is definitely going in.

1302
01:40:56,445 --> 01:40:57,913
Here take these.
-What?

1303
01:40:58,383 --> 01:41:00,583
I can't carry her out with these.

1304
01:41:01,411 --> 01:41:02,411
Scream loud.

1305
01:41:02,591 --> 01:41:03,591
You'll come?

1306
01:41:04,466 --> 01:41:05,466
I'll come.

1307
01:41:47,326 --> 01:41:48,326
Oh shit!

1308
01:45:02,853 --> 01:45:03,853
Shit!

1309
01:45:15,838 --> 01:45:16,838
Nope.
