1
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,180
This is Berk.

2
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,510
It's 12 days North of hopeless and a few degrees South of freezing to death.

3
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,740
It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery.

4
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,920
My village. In a word: sturdy.

5
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,880
It's been here for seven generations but every single building is new.

6
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,740
We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets.

7
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,100
The only problems are the pests.

8
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,210
You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes.

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,270
We have...

10
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,640
Dragons.

11
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,300
Most people would leave, but not us.

12
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,520
We're Vikings.

13
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,950
We stubbornness issues.

14
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,410
My name is Hiccup.

15
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,020
Great name, I know. But it's not the worst.

16
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,240
Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off Gnomes and Trolls.

17
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,170
Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that.

18
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,320
'Morning.

19
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,320
What are you doing here? Get inside!

20
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,160
Get back inside!

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,610
Hiccup! What is he doing out again... What are you doing out? Get inside!

22
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,320
That's Stoick the Vast, Chief of the tribe.

23
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,910
They say that when he was a baby he popped a Dragon's head clean off its shoulders.

24
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,900
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,840
What have we got?

26
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,090
Gronckles, Nadders, Zipplebacks... Oh, and hordes of Monstruous Nightmares.

27
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,480
Any Night Furys?

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,000
- None so far.  - Good.

29
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,830
Light the torches!

30
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,010
Oh, nice of you to join the party. I thought you'd been carried off.

31
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,000
Who? Me? Nah, come on... I'm way too muscular for their taste.

32
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,830
They wouldn't know what to do with all... this.

33
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,600
Well, they need toothpicks, don't they?

34
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,770
The meathead with the attitude and interchangeable hands, is Gobber.

35
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,230
I have been his apprentice ever since I was little.

36
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,320
Well, littler

37
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,860
We move to the moor defenses. We'll counterattack with the catapults.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,710
See? Old village. Lots and lots of new houses.

39
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
Fire!

40
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,150
Oh, and that's Fishlegs

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,060
Snotlout

42
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,930
The twins, Ruffnut and Tuffnut...

43
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,280
And...

44
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,900
Astrid.

45
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,400
Aww, their job is so much cooler.

46
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,970
Oh, come on. Let me out, please. I need to make my mark!

47
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,940
Oh, you have made plenty of marks. All in the wrong places.

48
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,170
Please, 2 minutes. I'll kill a dragon. My life will get infinitely better.

49
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,750
I might even get a date.

50
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,370
You can't lift a hammer. You can't swing an axe.

51
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,030
You can't even throw one of these.

52
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,310
Okay, fine, but this will throw it for me.

53
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,580
See, now this right here is what I'm talking about.

54
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,020
But it... it's a mild calibration issue.

55
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,250
Hiccup, if you ever want to get out there to fight dragons

56
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,750
you need to stop all....

57
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,220
this.

58
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,140
But you just pointed to all of me.

59
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,960
Yes, that's it.

60
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,240
Stop being all of you.

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,970
- Oh...  - Oh, yes.

62
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,150
You sir, are playing a dangerous game...

63
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,380
keeping this much raw Vikingness contained.

64
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,120
- There will be consequences!  - I take my chances.

65
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,380
Sword, sharpened, now!

66
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,670
One day I'll get out there.

67
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,370
Because killing a dragon is everything around here.

68
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,110
A Nadderhead is sure to get me at least noticed.

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,400
Gronckles are tough.

70
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,730
Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend.

71
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,370
A Zippleback: ...

72
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,180
exotic, two heads, twice the status.

73
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,640
They found the sheep!

74
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,880
Concentrate fire over the lower bank!

75
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,610
Hurry up!

76
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,010
Fire!

77
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,430
And then, there's the Monstruous Nightmare.

78
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,470
Only the best Vikings go after those.

79
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,180
They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire.

80
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,100
Reload!

81
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,270
I'll take care of this.

82
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,460
But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one's ever seen.

83
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,780
We call it the...

84
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,800
- Night Fury!  - Get down!

85
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,020
Jump!

86
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,640
This thing never steals food, never shows itself, and...

87
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,500
never misses.

88
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,590
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.

89
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,570
That's why I'm going to be the first.

90
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,060
Mind the fort, Hiccup. They need me out there.

91
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,490
Stay! Put!

92
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,960
There.

93
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,190
You know what I mean.

94
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,000
- Hiccup, what are you doing?  - Come back here!

95
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,330
Yeah, I know, Be right back!

96
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,620
Mind yourself!

97
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,230
The devils still have some juice in them.

98
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,660
Come on.

99
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,310
Give me something to shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.

100
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,160
Oh! I hit it? Yes, I hit it!

101
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,300
Did anybody see that?

102
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,640
Except for you.

103
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,750
- Do not let them escape!  - Right!

104
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,160
You're all out.

105
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,330
Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know...

106
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,600
Sorry, Dad.

107
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,910
Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.

108
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,360
It's not like the last few times, Dad!

109
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,270
I mean, I really actually hit...

110
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,730
You guys were busy and I had a very clear shot.

111
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,440
It went down just off Raven Point. Let's get a search party out there before...

112
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,960
Stop!

113
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,260
Just, stop!

114
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,570
Every time you step outside disaster falls.

115
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,830
Can you not see that I have bigger problems?

116
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,450
Winter is almost here and I have an entire village to feed!

117
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,450
Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding, don't you think?

118
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,780
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

119
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,920
Why can't you follow the simplest orders?

120
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,860
I, I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just...

121
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,290
kill it. You know, it's who I am, Dad.

122
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,810
Oh, you are many things, Hiccup, but a dragon killer is not one of them.

123
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,130
Get back to the house. Make sure he gets there.

124
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,640
I have his mess to clean up.

125
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,020
Quite the performance.

126
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,830
I've never seen any one mess up that badly. That helped!

127
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,810
Thank you. Thank you. I was trying.

128
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,760
- I really did hit one.  - Sure, Hiccup.

129
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,850
- He never listens.  - Well, it runs in the family.

130
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,790
And when he does, it's always with this disappointed scowl

131
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,160
like someone skimped on the meat in his sandwich.

132
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,360
Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring.

133
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,090
I ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on the side.

134
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,920
This here. This is a talking fish bone!

135
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,090
Now, you're thinking about this all wrong.

136
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,930
It's not so much what you look like. It's what's inside that he can't stand.

137
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,320
Thank you for summing that up.

138
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,440
Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not.

139
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,310
I just want to be one of you guys.

140
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,270
Either we face them or they'll finish us.

141
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,050
It's the only way we'll be rid of them.

142
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,590
If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave.

143
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,390
They'll find another home.

144
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,270
One more search, before the ice sets in.

145
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,220
Those ships never come back.

146
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,200
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.

147
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,800
Now who's with me?

148
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,310
Alright... Those who stay will look after Hiccup.

149
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,970
I'll pack my undies.

150
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,900
No, I need you to stay, and train some new recruits.

151
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:08,610
Oh, perfect, yeah. And while I'm busy Hiccup can cover the store.

152
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,920
Molten steel, razor sharp blades, lots of time to himself...

153
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,660
What could possibly go wrong?

154
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,760
Oh, what am I going to do with him, Gobber?

155
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,350
Put him in training with the others.

156
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,490
- No, I'm serious.  - So am I.

157
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,750
He'd be killed before you let the first dragon out of its cage.

158
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,610
- Oh, you don't know that.  - I do know that.

159
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,380
- No£¬ you don't  - No, actually, I do.

160
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,360
- No, you don't.  - Listen, you know what he's like.

161
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,150
From the time he could crawl he's been... different.

162
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,680
He doesn't listen. He has the attention span of a sparrow.

163
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,850
I take him fishing and he goes hunting for... for Trolls!

164
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,520
Trolls exist! They steal your socks.

165
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,350
But only the left ones. What's with that?

166
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,500
- When I was a boy...  - Oh, here we go.

167
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,510
My father told me to bang my head against a rock, and I did it.

168
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,210
I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him.

169
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,220
And you know what happened?

170
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,400
- You got a headache.  - That rock split in two.

171
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,270
It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber.

172
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,880
He could crush mountains, level forests,

173
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,340
tame seas!

174
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,030
Even as a boy I knew what I was, what I had to become...

175
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,860
Hiccup is not that boy.

176
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,880
You can't stop him, Stoick. You can only prepare him.

177
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,610
I know it seems hopeless, but the truth is you won't always be around to protect him.

178
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,620
He's going to get out there again. He's probably out there now.

179
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,680
Oh, the Gods hate me.

180
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,620
Some people lose their knife or their mug.

181
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,750
No, not me! I managed to lose an entire dragon.

182
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,220
Ow!

183
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,210
Oh, wow? I... I did it? Oh, I did it!

184
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,060
This fixes everything. Yes!

185
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,660
I have brought down this mighty beast!

186
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,030
I'm gonna kill you, dragon.

187
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,080
I'm gonna... I'm gonna cut out your heart and take it to my father.

188
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,110
I'm a Viking.

189
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,410
I'm a Viking!

190
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,840
I did this.

191
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,440
Hiccup.

192
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,420
Dad? Uh...

193
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,650
- I have to talk to you, Dad.  - I need to speak with you too, son.

194
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,660
- I think it's time you to learned to fight dragons.  - I don't want to fight dragons.

195
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,240
- What?  - What?

196
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,700
- Uh, you go first.  - No, no, you go first.

197
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,230
All right. You got your wish.

198
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,380
Dragon training. You start in the morning.

199
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,180
Oh man, I should have gone first.

200
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:51,010
Uh, cause I was thinking. You know, we have a surplus of dragon fighting Vikings but...

201
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,670
do we have enough bread-making Vikings, or small home repair Vikings...

202
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,260
- You'll need this.  - I don't want to fight dragons.

203
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,990
- Oh come on, yes you do.  - Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.

204
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,780
But you will kill dragons.

205
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,660
No, I'm really very extra sure that I won't.

206
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,050
- It's time, Hiccup.  - Can you not hear me?

207
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,660
This is serious, son.

208
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,610
When you carry this axe, you carry all of us with you.

209
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,600
Which means: You walk like us. You talk like us. You think like us.

210
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,160
- No more of... this.  - You just gestured to all of me.

211
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,930
- Deal?  - This conversation is feeling very one-sided.

212
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,950
Deal?

213
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,390
Deal.

214
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,830
Good.

215
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,330
Train hard.

216
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,780
I'll be back. Probably.

217
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,700
And I'll be here, maybe.

218
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,610
Welcome to dragon training.

219
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,940
No turning back.

220
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,670
I hope I get some serious burns.

221
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,290
I'm hoping for some mauling, like on my shoulder or lower back.

222
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,810
Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.

223
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,450
Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain, love it.

224
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,410
Oh, great, who let him in?

225
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,470
Lets get started. The recruit who does best,

226
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,870
will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.

227
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,700
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so does that disqualify him or...?

228
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,990
Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings?

229
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,250
Don't worry. You're small and you're weak, That will make you a less of a target.

230
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,700
They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more Viking-like teens instead.

231
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,450
Behind these doors are just a few of the

232
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,070
many species you will learn to fight.

233
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,310
- The Deadly Nadder.  - Speed: 8, Armor: 16.

234
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,550
- The Hideous Zippleback.  - 11 Stealth times two.

235
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,860
- The Monstrous Nightmare.  - Fire Power: 15.

236
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,200
- The Terrible Terror.  - Attack: 8, Venom: 12.

237
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,900
Can you stop that!

238
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,430
- And the Gronckle.  - Jaw Strength: 8.

239
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,890
Woah, woah, wait, aren't you going to teach us first?

240
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,020
I believe in learning on the job.

241
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,960
Today is about survival. If you get blasted, you're dead.

242
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,780
Quick! What's the first thing you're going to need?

243
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,390
- A doctor?  - + 5 Speed?

244
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,350
- A shield?  - Shield. Go.

245
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,280
Your most important piece of equipment is your shield.

246
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,370
If you must make a choice between a sword or a shield.

247
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,630
Take the shield.

248
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,810
- Get your hands off my shield.  - There's like a million shields.

249
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,220
Take that one. It has a flower on it. Girls like flowers.

250
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,620
Oops, now this one has blood on it.

251
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,630
Tuffnut, Ruffnut, your out.

252
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,620
- What?  - What?

253
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,560
Those shields are good for another thing. Noise.

254
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,970
Make lots of it and throw off a dragon's aim.

255
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,000
All dragons have a limited number of shots.

256
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,050
How many does a Gronckle have?

257
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,500
- Five?  - No, six.

258
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,490
Right, six. Thats one for each of you.

259
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,100
Fishlegs, out.

260
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,570
Hiccup, get in there!

261
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,120
So anyway, I moved into my parent's basement?

262
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,450
You should come by sometimes to work out, You look like you work out.

263
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,410
Snotlout, your done.

264
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,880
- So I guess it's just you and me.  - Nope, just you.

265
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,190
One shot left.

266
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,480
Hiccup!

267
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,010
And that's 6. Go back to bed you overgrown sausage.

268
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,660
You'll get another chance. Don't you worry.

269
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,570
Remember, a dragon will always...

270
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,750
always go for the kill.

271
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,520
So why didn't you?

272
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,360
Well this was stupid.

273
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,230
Why don't you just fly away?

274
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,320
Alright, where did Astrid go wrong in the ring today?

275
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,760
I mistimed my sommersault dive. It was sloppy. It threw off my reverse tumble.

276
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,080
- Yeah, we noticed.  - No, no you were great. That was so Astrid.

277
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,580
She's right. You have to be tough on yourselves. Where did Hiccup go wrong?

278
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,250
- Uh, he showed up?  - He didn't get eaten.

279
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,260
He's never where he should be.

280
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,880
Thank you, Astrid. You need to live and breathe this stuff.

281
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,280
The Dragon Manual... Everything we know about every dragon we know of.

282
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,840
No attacks tonight. Hurry up.

283
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,410
- Wait? You mean read?  - While we're still alive?

284
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,610
Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about?

285
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,380
Oh, I've read it like 7 times.

286
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,090
There's this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face

287
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,480
and there's this other one that buries itself for like a week...

288
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,600
Yeah, sounds great. There was a chance I was going to read that.

289
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,670
But now...

290
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,780
You guys read, I'll go kill something.

291
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,490
Hey!

292
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,070
- So I guess we'll share?  - Read it.

293
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:03,300
All mine then? Wow. So, okay. I'll see you uh... tomorrow.

294
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,690
Dragon Classifications

295
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,280
Strike Class, Fear Class, Mystery Class.

296
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:25,490
Thunder Drum. This reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

297
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:30,270
When startled, the Thunder Drum produces a concussive sound that can kill a man at close range.

298
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,710
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

299
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:39,380
Timberjack: This gigantic creature has razor-sharp wings that can slice through full-grown trees.

300
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,980
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

301
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:48,090
Skulldren: Sprays scalding water on its victim. Extremely dangerous...

302
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,730
Changeling: Even newly hatch dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.

303
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,730
Gronckle, Zippleback, The Skrill,

304
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,450
Boneknapper, Whispering Death.

305
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,000
Burns its victims. Buries its victims. Chokes its victims.

306
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,890
Turns victims inside out.

307
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,680
Extremely dangerous... Extremely dangerous...

308
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:18,040
Kill on sight... Kill on sight... Kill on sight...

309
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,380
Night Fury: Speed unknown. Size unknown.

310
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,320
The unholy offspring of lightning and death itself.

311
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,530
Never engage this dragon.

312
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:37,460
Your only chance: Hide and pray it does not find you.

313
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,000
I can almost smell them. They're close.

314
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,560
Steady.

315
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,810
- Take us in.  - Hard to port.

316
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,750
The Hell Hounds gate.

317
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,730
Hard to port.

318
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,750
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice, the book had nothing on Night Furys.

319
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:42,080
Is there like another book? or a sequel? Maybe a little Night Fury pamphlet?

320
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,300
Focus Hiccup! You're not even trying.

321
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,980
Today is all about attack!

322
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,870
Nadder's are quick and light on their feet. You be quicker and lighter.

323
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,630
I'm really beginning to question your teaching methods.

324
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,400
Look for its blind spot. Every dragon has one.

325
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,980
Find it. Hide in it, and strike.

326
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,450
- Do you ever bathe?  - You don't like it, then just get your own blind spot.

327
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,970
How about I give you one?

328
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,360
Blind spot, yes. Death spot, not-so-much.

329
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,080
Hey, hey, so how would one sneak up on a Night Fury?

330
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,050
No one's ever met one, and lived to tell the tale. Now, get in there!

331
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,370
I know, I know but hypothetically...

332
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,460
Watch out, babe, I'll take care of this.

333
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,090
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.

334
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,590
What do you want me to do? Block out the sun?

335
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,920
I can do that. I don't have time right now.

336
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,850
- Has anyone ever seen one napping?  - Hiccup!

337
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,890
Hiccup!

338
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,650
- Love on the battlefield.  - She could do better.

339
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,520
L... Let me... why don't you...

340
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,130
Ow! Ow! Ow!

341
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,940
Well done, Astrid.

342
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,440
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

343
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:37,460
Our parent's war is about to become ours. Figure out which side your on.

344
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,660
Huh? Toothless.

345
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,470
I could of sworn you have...

346
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,780
teeth.

347
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,240
Uh, uh... no, no... no...

348
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,030
I... I don't have anymore.

349
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,770
And with one twist, he took my hand and swallowed it whole.

350
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:20,130
And I saw the look in his face. I was delicious.

351
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,190
He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month

352
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,320
before another one of them took my leg.

353
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,130
Isn't it weird to think that your hand was inside a dragon?

354
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,940
Like, if your mind was still in control of it, you could have killed the dragon from the inside

355
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,260
by crushing his heart or something.

356
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,380
I swear, I'm so angry right now.

357
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,410
I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.

358
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,920
I'll chop of the legs of every dragon I fight... with my face!

359
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,040
No. It's the wings and the tails you really want.

360
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,680
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

361
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,490
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

362
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,250
- Yeah.  - Yeah.

363
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,780
Alright, I'm off to bed.

364
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,650
You should be too. Tomorrow we get to the big boys.

365
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,650
Slowly but surely, making our way up to Monstruous Nightmare.

366
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:12,680
- But who'll win the honor of killing it?  - It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?

367
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,960
- Your mom let you get a tattoo?  - It's not a tattoo. It's a birth mark.

368
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,720
Okay, I've been stuck with you since birth and that was never there before.

369
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,010
Yes, it was. You've just never seen me to the left side until now.

370
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,740
Hey, Toothless. I brought breakfast.

371
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,750
I hope... I hope you're hungry.

372
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,940
Okay, that's disgusting.

373
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:20,470
I got some salmon, some nice Icelandic cod, and a whole smoked eel.

374
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,590
No, no, no, no... no... Okay.

375
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,830
Yeah, I don't really like eel much either.

376
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:40,280
That's it. That's the good stuff. Aah, don't you mind me.

377
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:45,220
I'll just be back here, minding my own business.

378
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,940
It's okay...

379
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,810
Okay, okay...

380
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,160
Okay, that's not too bad. It works.

381
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,840
No, no, no, no, no, no...!

382
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,940
Oh my... It's working!

383
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,800
Yes, yes, I did it.

384
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,290
Today, is about teamwork.

385
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,230
Now, a wet dragon head can't light its fire.

386
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,280
The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky.

387
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,640
One head breathes gas. The other head lights it.

388
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,500
Your job is to know which is which.

389
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,200
Razor-sharp serrated teeth, and injects venom for predigestion.

390
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,610
Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims.

391
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,200
Will you please stop that?!

392
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,570
If that dragon shows either of his faces, I'm gonna...

393
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,620
There!

394
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,930
Hey, it's us, idiots!

395
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,280
Your butts are getting bigger we thought you were a dragon.

396
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,670
Not that there's anything wrong with a dragon-ass fig...

397
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,150
Wait...

398
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:05,220
Oh! Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

399
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,490
Chances of survival are dwindling into single digits now.

400
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,770
Oh! Wrong head.

401
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,760
Fishlegs!

402
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,770
Now Hiccup!

403
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,790
Aww, come on...

404
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,630
Hiccup!

405
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,550
Back, back, back!

406
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,340
Now don't you make me tell you again!

407
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,540
Yes, that's right. Back into your cage!

408
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,660
Now think about what you've done.

409
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,750
Okay, sooo, were we done?

410
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:04,500
'Cause I have some things I need to uh... Yep, I'll see you tomorrow.

411
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,010
Hey!

412
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,180
- What was that?  - How did you do that?

413
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,750
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys go on ahead.

414
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,030
I'll catch up with you.

415
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,410
Meet the Terrible Terror.

416
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,950
Ha! It's like the size of my...

417
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,610
Oooh! Get it off!

418
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,820
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

419
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,000
Wow! He's better than you ever were.

420
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,600
What?

421
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,120
Ooh, great.

422
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,030
Hiccup.

423
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,940
Hiccup? Are you in there?

424
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:11,840
Astrid, hey. Hi, Astrid. Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid

425
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,310
I normally don't care what people do, but you're acting weird.

426
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,890
Well, weirder.

427
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,520
Well, I trust you found the nest at least?

428
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,980
Not even close.

429
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,660
Excellent.

430
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,040
I hope you had a little more success than me.

431
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:57,400
Well, if by success, you mean that your parenting troubles are over with...

432
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,700
then, yes.

433
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,450
Congratulations Stoick! Everyone is so relieved.

434
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,610
Out with the old, and in with the new, right?

435
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,060
No one will miss that old nuisance.

436
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,510
The village is throwing a party to celebrate.

437
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,680
He's gone?

438
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,060
Um, yeah, most afternoons, but who can blame him?

439
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,180
I mean, the life of a celebrity is very rough.

440
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,780
He can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans.

441
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,110
- Hiccup?  - Who would have thought it, eh?

442
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:26,650
He has this way with the beasts.

443
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:37,820
Okay there, bud, were gonna take this nice and slow.

444
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:42,230
Here we go. Here we go. Position three, no, four.

445
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,000
Alright, it's go time. It's go time.

446
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,330
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.

447
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,500
Yes, it works!

448
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,700
Sorry!

449
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,550
That's my fault.

450
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,010
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Position four, uh, three.

451
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:42,400
Yeah! Go baby!

452
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,190
Oh, this is amazing! The wind in my...

453
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,940
cheat sheet!

454
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,990
Stop!

455
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,340
No!

456
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,340
Oh, Gosh! Oh, God!

457
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,790
Oh no!

458
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,100
Alright. Okay. You gotta kinda angle yourself!

459
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,460
Okay. No, no, no... Come back down towards me.

460
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,820
Come back down... Oww!

461
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,130
Yeah!

462
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,060
Come on...

463
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:04,550
Uh, no thanks. I'm good.

464
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,470
Not so fire-proof on the inside, are you?

465
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,030
Here you go.

466
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,430
Everything we know about you guys is wrong.

467
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,460
Dad, you're back!

468
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,390
Gobber's not here, so...

469
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,550
I know.

470
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,090
I came looking for you.

471
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,430
- You did?  - You've been keeping secrets.

472
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,180
I have?

473
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,290
Just how long did you think you could hide it from me?

474
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,230
I... I don't know what you...

475
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:39,010
Nothing happens on this island, without me hearing about it.

476
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,050
Oh?

477
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:45,860
So, lets talk... about that dragon

478
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,920
Oh Gods...

479
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,890
Dad, I'm so sorry. I...

480
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:53,440
I was going to tell you, I just didn't know how to uh...

481
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,750
- You... you're not upset?  - What? I was hoping for this!

482
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,020
- Ah, you were?  - And believe me...

483
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,500
It only gets better. Just wait till you spill a Nadder's guts for the first time...

484
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:11,170
and mount your first Gronckle head on a spear.

485
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:15,270
What feeling! You really had me going there, son.

486
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:20,570
All those years of the worst Viking Berk has ever seen.

487
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:23,300
Odin, it was rough. I almost gave up on you.

488
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:25,630
And all the while you were holding out on me.

489
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,430
Oh, Thor almighty!

490
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:32,570
With you doing so well in the ring...

491
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:35,290
we finally have something to talk about.

492
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,340
I uh, I brought you something...

493
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,230
to keep you safe in the ring.

494
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,580
Wow, thanks.

495
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:01,810
Your mother would wanted you to have it.

496
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,150
It's half of her breast plate.

497
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:10,140
Matching set. Keeps her... Keeps her close, you know.

498
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:13,760
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.

499
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,060
You've held your end of the deal.

500
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,970
I should really get to bed.

501
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,620
- Yes, good, okay, good talk.  - Yeah...

502
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,850
I'll see you back at the house. Great. Thanks for stopping by and...

503
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:33,030
- the uh... breast hat.  - I hope you like the, umm... the hat.

504
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,220
Well, good night.

505
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:54,500
Stay out of my way. I'm winning this thing!

506
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,660
Good. Please. By all means.

507
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,010
This time! This time for sure!

508
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:24,630
No! No, son-of-a half troll, rat-eating munch bucket...!

509
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,960
Wait! Wait.

510
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,130
So... later.

511
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,670
- Oh, oh! Not so fast!  - I'm kinda late for...

512
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,140
What! Late for what, exactly?

513
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:36,490
Okay, quiet down. The Elder has decided.

514
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:50,410
Boy, you've done it! You've done it, Hiccup!

515
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,630
You get to kill the dragon!

516
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,990
That's my boy!

517
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,290
Yeah! Yes, I can't wait. I am so...

518
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,500
leaving. We're Leaving.

519
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:03,700
Let's pack up.

520
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,730
Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation.

521
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,410
Forever.

522
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,120
Awww, man.

523
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,420
What the...? Uh, w... what are you doing here?

524
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,590
I want to know what's going on.

525
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,640
No one just get as good as you do.

526
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,750
Especially... you.

527
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,610
- Start talking.  - I... I...

528
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,610
Are you training with someone?

529
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,830
Training? I didn't...

530
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,740
It better not involve this.

531
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,090
I know, this looks really bad but you see, this is...

532
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,560
You're right. You're right. You're right. I... I'm through with the lies.

533
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,100
I've been making... outfits!

534
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,050
So, you got me. It's time everyone knew.

535
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,450
Drag me back. Go ahead. Here we go.

536
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:51,690
Oww. Why would you do that?

537
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,420
That's for the lies!

538
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,760
And that's... for everything else!

539
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:57,880
Oh man.

540
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:00,040
Get down!

541
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,250
Run! Run!

542
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:09,370
No! No! It's okay. It's okay. She's a friend.

543
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:12,800
You just scared him.

544
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,190
I scared him?

545
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,680
Who is him?

546
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,210
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.

547
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,540
Dut, da da... We're dead.

548
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,330
Woah, woah woah. Where do you think your going?

549
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,110
Oh, great Odin! Don't. Oh, this is...

550
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,600
Hiccup, get me down from here!

551
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,790
You have to give me a chance to explain.

552
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:00,900
I am not listening to anything you have to say!

553
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,870
Then I won't speak. Just let me show you.

554
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,940
Please, Astrid.

555
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,510
Now get me down!

556
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,370
Toothless, down. Gently.

557
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,540
See, nothing to be afraid of.

558
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,110
Toothless?

559
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,130
What is wrong with you? Bad dragon!

560
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,190
He's uh, he's not usually like this.

561
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:44,360
Oh, no!

562
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,920
Toothless, what are you doing? We need her to like us!

563
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:57,510
And now he's spinning!

564
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,090
Thank you for nothing you useless reptile!

565
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,290
Okay, I am sorry, I'm sorry. Just get me off of this thing.

566
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,860
Alright, I admit it. This is pretty cool.

567
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:02,000
It's amazing. He's amazing.

568
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:06,210
So what now?

569
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,090
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow!

570
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,100
You know your gonna have to kill a...

571
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,030
kill a dragon...

572
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,400
Don't remind me.

573
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,670
Toothless, what happening?

574
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,360
Whoa, what is it?

575
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:26,570
Get down!

576
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:45,780
- What's going on?  - I don't know.

577
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:48,550
Toothless, you gotta get us out of here, bud.

578
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:53,910
It looks like they're hauling in their kill.

579
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,570
What does that make us?

580
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:42,690
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.

581
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,740
Oh, it's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole.

582
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,630
They're not eating any of it.

583
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,380
What... was that?

584
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:32,470
Alright, bud, we gotta get out of here. Now!

585
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,420
No, no, it totally makes sense. It's like a giant beehive.

586
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,960
They're the workers, and that's their queen.

587
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,920
It controls them. Let's find your dad.

588
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,090
No, no.

589
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:56,160
No. Not yet. They'll kill Toothless.

590
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,720
Astrid, we have to think this through, carefully.

591
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,760
Hiccup, we just discovered the dragon's nest.

592
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,790
The thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here.

593
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,650
And you want to keep it secret?

594
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:11,000
To protect your pet, dragon? Are you serious?

595
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,650
Yes.

596
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,220
Okay. Then what do we do?

597
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,250
Just give me until tomorrow. I'll figure something out.

598
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,280
Okay...

599
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,000
That's for kidnapping me.

600
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:42,660
That's for... everything else.

601
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,450
What are you looking at?

602
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,080
Well, I can show my face in public again.

603
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:07,130
If someone had told me that in a few short weeks

604
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:14,630
Hiccup will go from... well being... uh... Hiccup,

605
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:17,990
to placing first in dragon training.

606
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:22,570
Well, I would have tied him to a mast and shipped him off. For fear he'd gone mad.

607
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,090
And you know it.

608
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,420
But, here we are.

609
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,020
And no ones more surprised or more proud than I am.

610
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,170
Today my boy becomes a Viking!

611
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,230
Today he becomes one of us!

612
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,010
Be careful with that dragon.

613
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,840
It's not the dragon I'm worried about.

614
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,450
What are you going to do?

615
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,040
Put an end to this.

616
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:54,740
I have to try.

617
01:00:55,310 --> 01:01:00,710
Astrid, if something goes wrong, just make sure they don't find Toothless.

618
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:04,910
I will, just promise me it won't go wrong.

619
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:07,130
It's time, Hiccup.

620
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,140
Knock 'em dead.

621
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,710
I'd have gone for the hammer.

622
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,000
I'm ready.

623
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,110
Go on Hiccup, give it to him!

624
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,450
What is he doing?

625
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:17,640
It's okay, it's okay.

626
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,280
I'm not one of them.

627
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,680
What's he thinking?

628
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,870
Stop the fight!

629
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:37,680
No! I need you all to see this.

630
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:41,400
They're not what we think they are.

631
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:43,510
We don't have to kill them.

632
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,290
I said stop the fight!

633
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,140
Out of my way!

634
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:57,160
Hiccup!

635
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,390
Hiccup!

636
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:26,810
This way!

637
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:48,940
Night Fury!

638
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,200
Alright, Toothless. Go! Get out of here.

639
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,960
Go, go!

640
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,330
No, dad! Dad, he won't hurt you!

641
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,560
Toothless, stop!

642
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,180
No. No!

643
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:30,490
Get him!

644
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,390
No, no, please. Just don't hurt him

645
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:37,730
Please. Don't hurt him

646
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,360
Put it with the others.

647
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,110
I should have known.

648
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,890
I should have seen the signs.

649
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,640
- Dad?  - We had a deal!

650
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:57,710
I know! We did, but that was before I... Oh, it's all so messed up.

651
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:01,170
So everything in that ring... A trick? A lie?

652
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:04,110
I screwed up. I should have told you before now.

653
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,510
Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please, just don't hurt Toothless.

654
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:12,570
The dragon? That's what you're worried about?

655
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:14,650
Not the people you almost killed?

656
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:16,840
He was just protecting me! He's not dangerous.

657
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:19,370
They've killed hundreds of us!

658
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:23,740
And we've killed thousands of them. They defend themselves, that's all.

659
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:26,670
They raid us because they have to.

660
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:30,750
If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves.

661
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:34,870
There's something else on their island, dad. It's a dragon-like...

662
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,460
Their island? So, you've been to the nest?

663
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:40,560
- Did I say nest?  - How did you find it?

664
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:45,540
No, no, I didn't. Toothless did. Only a dragon can find the island.

665
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:50,060
No, no, dad, no please. It's not what you think.

666
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,360
You don't know what your up against. It's like nothing you've ever seen.

667
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:56,890
Dad, please, I promise you. You can't win this one!

668
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,070
Dad, no!

669
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,500
For once in your life, would you please just listen to me!

670
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,160
You've thrown your lot in with them.

671
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,440
You're not a Viking.

672
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,970
You're not my son!

673
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,270
Ready the ships!

674
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:15,550
Set sail!

675
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,800
We head for Hell Hounds gate.

676
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,710
Lead us home, devil.

677
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,920
It's a mess. You must feel horrible.

678
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:59,040
You've lost everything. Your father, your tribe, your best friend.

679
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,160
Thank you for summing that up.

680
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,050
Why couldn't I've killed that dragon, when I found him the woods?

681
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:08,720
Would've been better for everyone.

682
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:10,550
Yep, the rest of us would have done it.

683
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,610
So, why didn't you?

684
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:17,910
Why didn't you?

685
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,970
I don't know. I couldn't.

686
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:24,480
- That's not an answer.  - Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?

687
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,220
Because I want to remember what you say, right now.

688
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,650
Ah, for the love of... I was coward, I was weak.

689
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,580
I wouldn't kill a dragon!

690
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:34,900
You said wouldn't that time?

691
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,930
Whatever, I wouldn't!

692
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:41,130
300 years and I'm the first Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.

693
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,470
First to ride one though.

694
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:51,010
So?

695
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:57,090
I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was.

696
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,670
I looked at him and I saw myself.

697
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:05,800
I bet he's really frightened now.

698
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:08,140
What are you gonna do about it?

699
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:12,370
Probably something stupid.

700
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,640
Good, but you've already done that.

701
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,860
Then something crazy!

702
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,920
That's more like it.

703
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:33,040
Sound your positions! Stay within earshot.

704
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:40,390
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some of the men just now and well, you know...

705
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:43,150
some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here?

706
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:46,590
Not me of course. I know you are always the man with the plan.

707
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:51,060
But some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at all...

708
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,310
and what it might be?

709
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:55,130
Find the nest and take it.

710
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:59,780
Of course. Send them running. The old Viking fallback. Nice and simple.

711
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:09,610
Step aside.

712
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,790
Head to port.

713
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:35,120
If you're planning on getting eaten, I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

714
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:40,400
You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon.

715
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:41,360
It's me.

716
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:43,760
- I love this plan!  - I didn't...

717
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:46,630
You're crazy. I like that.

718
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:50,100
So, what is the plan?

719
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:02,020
That's not very encouraging.

720
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:05,850
Oh, I was wondering where that went.

721
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:21,140
Stay low, and ready your weapons.

722
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:38,990
We're here.

723
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:12,960
Wait, what are you... ?!

724
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,670
It's okay... It's okay.

725
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:29,180
Where are you going?

726
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:32,060
You're gonna need something to help you hold on.

727
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,330
When we crack this mountain open, all hell is gonna break loose.

728
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:48,050
In my undies. Good thing I brought extras.

729
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:51,590
No matter how this ends, it ends today.

730
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:49,080
Is that it?

731
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,370
We've done it!

732
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,440
This isn't over!

733
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:06,930
Form your ranks. Pull together!

734
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:22,050
Get clear!

735
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,700
Beards of Thor...! What is that?

736
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:40,680
Odin, help us!

737
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:47,570
- Catapults!  - Fire!

738
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:58,610
- Get to the ships!  - No, nooo!

739
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:13,560
- Not that one...  - I was a fool.

740
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:15,790
Lead the men to the far side of the island.

741
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:17,160
Gobber, go with the men.

742
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:20,210
I think I'll stay, just in case you're thinking of doing something crazy.

743
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:23,490
I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing something to hunt for.

744
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:26,310
Then I can double that time.

745
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:30,970
- Here!  - Oh, no. Here!

746
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:45,650
- Fight me!  - No, me!

747
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,620
Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs!

748
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:56,400
Move, Fishlegs!

749
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:01,380
Look at us! We're on dragons! We're on dragons! All of us!

750
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:10,200
Every bit the bull-headed stubborn Viking you ever were.

751
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:13,600
- Fishlegs, break it down!  - Okay.

752
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:17,720
Heavily armored skull and tail made for bashing and crushing. Steer clear of both.

753
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:21,190
Small eyes, large nostrils. Relies on hearing and smell.

754
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:25,270
Okay, Lout, Legs, hang in its blind spot. Make some noise. Keep it confused.

755
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:28,300
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit. Make it mad.

756
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,790
- That's my specialty!  - Since when?

757
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:32,670
Everyone knows I'm more irritating, see.

758
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,560
Just do what I told you. I'll be back as soon as I can.

759
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:38,980
Don't worry! We got it covered!

760
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:40,230
Yeah!

761
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,340
- Fool!  - Butto!

762
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:50,700
Bye, ya Grendel!

763
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:59,330
Um, this thing doesn't have a blind spot!

764
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,100
There!

765
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,160
Go help the others!

766
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:15,700
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

767
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:22,710
- It's working!  - Yeah, it's working!

768
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:36,350
I've lost power on the Gronckle! Snotlout, do something!

769
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:39,680
I'm okay!

770
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:41,980
Less okay.

771
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:48,550
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy? You got something in your eye?

772
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:54,430
Yeah, you're the Viking!

773
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:01,300
Woah!

774
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,410
Dad?

775
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,680
You got it, buddy!

776
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:56,540
Hiccup!

777
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,050
I'm sorry...

778
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:02,580
for... for everything.

779
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:04,520
Yeah... me too.

780
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,140
You don't have to go up there.

781
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:10,260
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard...

782
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:14,010
I'm proud to call you my son.

783
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:17,380
Thanks, Dad.

784
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,140
He's up!

785
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:29,280
Get Snotlout outta there!

786
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:30,600
- I'm on it!  - I'm on it first!

787
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,820
Hey, let me drive!

788
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:35,850
- Don't push me!  - I'll push your teeth out!

789
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,240
You know, I can't believe that worked.

790
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:51,940
- Night Fury!  - Get down!

791
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:03,820
Did you get her?

792
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:14,330
Go!

793
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:19,120
This thing has wings. Okay, let's see if it can use them!

794
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:36,950
You think that did it?

795
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,860
Well, he can fly.

796
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:09,200
Okay, Toothless, time to disappear! Come on, bud!

797
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:16,940
Here it comes!

798
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:10,120
Watch out!

799
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:14,960
Okay, time's up. Let's see if this works.

800
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,950
Come on! Is that the best you can do?

801
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:40,440
Stay with me, buddy. We're good. Just a little bit longer.

802
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:48,570
Hold, Toothless. Now!

803
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:14,960
No... No!

804
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:34,980
Hiccup! Hiccup!

805
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:37,860
Son!

806
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:41,590
Hiccup!

807
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,360
Oh son!

808
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:07,610
I did this.

809
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:41,940
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

810
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:48,800
Hiccup!

811
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:58,940
He's alive! You brought him back alive!

812
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:18,890
Thank you... for saving my son.

813
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:22,960
Well, you know, most of him.

814
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,420
Hey, Toothless.

815
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:45,470
Happy to see you too, buddy.

816
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:50,700
Aawww, what... uh... I'm... in my house

817
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,820
You're in my house.

818
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:56,290
Does my dad know you're here?

819
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:58,400
Uh, what, oh, okay... okay.

820
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:03,160
Toothless, no. Toothless! Aw, come on.

821
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:43,840
Okay. Thanks, bud.

822
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,760
Toothless, stay here.

823
01:26:57,170 --> 01:27:00,260
C'mon guys. Get ready! Hold on tight. Here we go!

824
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:04,060
What?

825
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:15,020
I knew it. I'm dead.

826
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,020
No, but you give it your best shot.

827
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:20,010
So, what do you think?

828
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,670
Hey look, it's Hiccup!

829
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,110
Hiccup!

830
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:30,350
It turns out, all we needed was a little more of... this.

831
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,600
You just gestured to all of me?

832
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:37,000
Well, most of you. That bit's my handiwork.

833
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:40,510
With a little Hiccup flare thrown in. You think that'll do?

834
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:42,880
I might make a few tweaks.

835
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:46,580
That's... for scaring me.

836
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:49,080
What... what, is it always going to be this way? Because...

837
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,560
I could get used to it.

838
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:58,420
Welcome home.

839
01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:00,870
- Night Fury!  - Get down!

840
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,680
You ready?

841
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:17,970
This is Berk...

842
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:22,690
It snows nine months of the year and hails the other three.

843
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:27,200
Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless.

844
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:32,490
The people that grow here are even more so.

845
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,980
The only upsides are the pets.

846
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:44,970
While other places have ponies or parrots...

847
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,090
We have...

848
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:51,000
Dragons.
