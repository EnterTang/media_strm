896
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:34,780
{\pos(288,255)\fscx50}而是因为你是玩具  你是他的玩具
It's because you're a toy. You are his toy.

All I can do is...

Why would Andy ever want to play with me...

909
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,670
{\pos(288,255)\fscx50}怎么还会喜欢我呢
when he's got you?

910

I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.
