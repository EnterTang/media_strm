Mother

3
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,248
Mother

4
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:49,953
Mother

5
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:56,618
Mother

6
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,243
Mother

7
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,572
don't want

8
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:11,822
don't want

9
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,455
Don't go

10
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,325
Don't leave me alone

11
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,573
Mother

12
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,199
do not leave Me

13
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,538
don't want

14
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:34,577
elder sister

15
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,539
elder sister

16
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,824
Why does the rain never stop falling?

17
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,905
Yes, you just got caught in so much rain

18
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:45,828
Don't catch a cold

19
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,948
Just blow dry it in a while

20
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,823
What happened to Shensu?

21
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,573
How many times have I told you not to make trouble on the bus?

22
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,619
Lao Jin, don't be so harsh on the child.

23
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,207
Don't mess with your sister, Tangdou'er

24
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:00,784
Whose child is so obedient?

25
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,331
Yes or no

26
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,618
Be good

27
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,538
Mother

28
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,289
I dreamed of you again

29
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,539
How are you

30
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,246
I don't know which city you live in now.

31
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,448
Dad said

32
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,699
I'm very different now than when I was a kid.

33
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,824
If you meet on the road

34
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,698
You will still recognize me

35
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,788
Is it right

36
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,949
Passengers of the Ocean Sirius, follow me.

37
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,118
Come on, follow me.

38
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,457
Hurry up, Betelgeux

39
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,414
I'm coming

40
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,165
Today is a very special day

41
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,325
Dad took us on a cruise

42
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,198
Finally I'm going to see the sea

43
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,039
I am really happy

44
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,624
This boat is nice and fancy.

45
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,039
Mom, look, there are seagulls.

46
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:12,909
Do not miss passing through

47
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:16,114
Portrait photography: 10 yuan per piece

48
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,198
Mother

49
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,041
I still remember when I was little

50
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,704
You often tell me stories about sea elves

51
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,073
you say

52
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,948
On birthday

53
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,199
Make a wish to the sea

54
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,324
It will appear

55
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,415
Take you to realize your wish

56
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:14,157
Come and take a photo together

57
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,954
Does Sugar Bean look like a little sea otter?

58
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,995
Come over and take some photos with us.

59
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:23,531
come on

60
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:24,663
Come come come

61
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,077
Take this

62
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,074
Sister, take this.

63
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,665
Dad, hold your daughter tighter

64
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,414
okay

65
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:33,743
Come and see how it goes

66
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,614
dad

67
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,197
Dad, I

68
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,823
Okay, let's go have fun.

69
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,073
Remember to come back before dinner.

70
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,368
This little sea otter is so cute

71
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,990
It really looks like

72
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,916
This is a six-day, seven-night luxury tour.

73
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:53,329
That's worth the price.

74
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,822
baby

75
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:56,868
Mother

76
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,581
Let's go find dad.

77
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,868
clown

78
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,241
It's too late. We need to go eat.

79
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,535
Just one minute

80
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:04,622
It's dark now

81
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,661
Just one second

82
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,788
kid

83
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,448
Buy a copy

84
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,449
The Legend of Deep Sea Hotel

85
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,073
168 Not expensive

86
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,916
Sorry uncle, I'm just taking a look

87
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,541
If you don't buy it, you'll break it.

88
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,198
Go Go

89
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,948
It's really unlucky

90
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,325
Sugar Bean, don't run around

91
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,699
Sugar Bean, come here

92
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,323
Look what this is

93
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:38,781
Lollipop

94
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,032
I want

95
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,203
Drink less old gin.

96
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,244
The purpose of going out to play is to have fun.

97
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:46,577
Orion

98
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,572
Orion

99
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,072
Come come come

100
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,574
Let's celebrate Tangdouer's kindergarten

101
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,494
Sugar Bean goes to kindergarten

102
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,455
cheers

103
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,414
Cheers Cup

104
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,746
Sea elf with little girl

105
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,583
Swim to a big castle

106
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:32,247
It turned out that her mother was calling her with singing.

107
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,119
Cake is coming

108
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,162
The cake is here, make a wish

109
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,829
I want to be with my mother forever

110
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,540
Okay, we'll be together forever.

111
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,123
Never leave each other

112
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,822
Mother

113
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,118
Mother

114
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,618
Mother

115
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:53,663
Wake up!

116
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:54,947
Wake up!

117
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,039
Wake up!

118
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,323
Wake up!

119
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,198
Wake up!

120
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,449
You will sing my mother's songs

121
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,288
Who are you

122
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,948
Sea elves

123
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,039
Mother

124
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,743
Where are you going

125
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,447
Mother

126
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,323
You have to take me to my mother.

127
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,324
You know where my mom is, right?

128
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,032
Mother

129
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,573
Hello

130
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,948
anyone there

131
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,865
Take a look

132
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,911
This restaurant's food is not delicious.

133
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,908
Still doing these fancy tricks

134
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:26,747
What's the use of this?

135
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,581
This is only the first day

136
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,574
I haven't had a full meal.

137
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,199
I signed up for a six-day, seven-night luxury tour.

138
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:33,947
A weight loss class

139
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,289
I said I wouldn't stay any longer.

140
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,448
Today I have to swim back even if I have to.

141
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:42,121
Everyone, please stop smoking.

142
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:44,577
I'll ask you

143
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,323
This scrambled eggs with tomatoes

144
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,075
Have you ever fried whole tomatoes?

145
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,120
I've never heard of oyster ice cream.

146
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,288
Isn't chocolate stuffed sausage disgusting?

147
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,950
I want to drink a bowl of millet porridge now

148
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,745
Look, my cheeks have shrunk due to hunger these days.

149
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,910
fish

150
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,040
Our boss likes to innovate.

151
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,953
This is his creative dish.

152
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,198
walrus

153
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,405
I beg you to stop innovating.

154
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:15,454
If that doesn't work, you can just give me a bowl of dumpling soup.

155
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,322
pimple

156
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,082
Coincidentally, our best

157
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,620
It's pimple soup

158
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,197
I've been talking for a long time, are you kidding me?

159
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:27,952
This is pimple soup.

160
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,831
Isn't this a cuttlefish?

161
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,580
Isn't this a squid?

162
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,823
Oh my God

163
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,869
Isn't this seafood?

164
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,331
How did this get here?

165
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,741
unlucky

166
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,578
unlucky

167
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,119
You are unlucky

168
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,823
You let me go down

169
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,164
Go down

170
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,948
You let me go down

171
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,364
Go down quickly

172
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,780
Bad luck, leave now

173
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,494
Cuttlefish gets bigger

174
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,412
I'm going to change back to my original form.

175
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:21,408
The review dropped to one star again

176
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,290
These guys are too picky.

177
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:25,452
Is there wealth?

178
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,119
Isn't this dish a bit avant-garde?

179
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,081
No cutting corners

180
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,323
No big deal

181
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,665
Give yourself a good vacation

182
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,912
Dare to destroy my place

183
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,322
uncle

184
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,745
Don't hurt it

185
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,115
Where did you come from?

186
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,950
It brought me to my mother.

187
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,740
Don't hurt it

188
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,573
You stole my things

189
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,414
you give me

190
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,999
Letting go

191
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,740
Don't squeeze my waist.

192
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,290
Dare to steal things from me

193
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:03,407
Whose cell phone is this?

194
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,664
It's mine

195
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,614
South River

196
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:11,204
Did you see the bad luck that just came in?

197
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,323
Expelled

198
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,072
You got wet.

199
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,244
After a while of drying, it will return to human form.

200
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:17,743
What time does the work start?

201
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,081
I'm talking about Lao Jin

202
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,950
Is there anyone eating at work?

203
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:23,907
That's right. No.

204
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,745
I don't even exclude my parents who provide me with food and clothing.

205
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,832
Here, here

206
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:30,532
Just get it out.

207
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:32,407
I've never seen such difficult parents.

208
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,658
What about our hotel loan?

209
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:35,827
Sooner or later I can pay it back

210
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:38,908
I also promised to make dumpling soup for the guests.

211
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:39,781
etc.

212
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,407
Dumpling Soup

213
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,532
Look, Mr. Jin

214
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:46,157
I caught the sea elf

215
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:49,033
It is said that just a small bite

216
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:50,407
It can make people laugh

217
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:51,998
This thing looks weird.

218
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,036
Don't use it to make creative dishes

219
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,865
It's not that complicated

220
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,248
Fresh ingredients are often

221
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,491
Only the simplest cooking is needed

222
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:02,748
Hurry and bring our parents back

223
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,036
I made them dumpling soup.

224
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:06,782
You really have to eat it

225
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:08,373
Aren't you afraid of getting sick from eating this?

226
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,123
Eat it

227
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:42,782
October

228
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:45,908
Harvest season

229
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:48,533
Monsoons in the Northern Hemisphere

230
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:51,249
Nourishes lush crops

231
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,074
Golden wheat fields

232
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,533
Bright red peppers

233
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:58,658
Green rapeseed

234
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,749
Fat duck

235
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,786
Fresh live shrimp

236
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:04,908
Tight ham

237
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:07,704
Fresh deep sea fish

238
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,824
A gift from nature

239
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:14,532
The top ingredients that made our Deep Sea Hotel

240
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,036
High-end ingredients

241
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:19,784
The chef's professional cooking is indispensable

242
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,282
After stir-frying

243
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:22,532
Oil splash

244
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:23,656
Pan-Fried

245
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:24,907
Deep fried

246
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,707
Carefully prepared seasoning

247
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,039
The overflowing fragrance gently blows

248
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:35,955
Stirring the deep desire in your heart

249
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,539
Among the many delicious

250
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,078
The best

251
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:42,701
This is the secret of our store that has never been revealed for a century

252
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:46,405
Smiling pimple soup

253
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,286
Be careful

254
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,870
This is made by the boss himself, so don't spill it.

255
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,615
Has the boss invented a new dish?

256
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:55,705
Know and ask

257
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:58,657
This soup tastes weird.

258
00:24:58,667 --> 00:24:59,622
Can I give it to the guests?

259
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,365
I said to make a normal dumpling soup

260
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,615
He is not creative

261
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,161
If the customer complains again, I won't clean up his mess

262
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:06,282
From now on

263
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:08,578
Gourmet food is no longer gourmet food

264
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:13,202
It's a journey that cleanses the soul

265
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:24,290
Give way

266
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,286
Excuse me

267
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:28,531
sorry

268
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,744
sorry

269
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:50,283
The big monster in the sea just now

270
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:51,782
It seems that it is not swimming fast

271
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:54,408
Maybe he's hungry like us.

272
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:56,408
Did you notice the look in his eyes?

273
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:58,248
There is a faint sadness

274
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,367
There are so many eyes, which one are you talking about?

275
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,206
Sir, Madam, please come in.

276
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,869
I heard there's something to eat today.

277
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,457
You're not dead yet, let's wait and see

278
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,364
waiter

279
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:40,114
gentlemen

280
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,990
Which table was I sitting at?

281
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,080
Sir, you are number 10

282
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:45,873
My memory is not very good.

283
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:47,786
You are a goldfish, is that normal?

284
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,494
We are at No. 9

285
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,365
This is not sour

286
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,707
Maybe the chef kneaded the dough with his feet.

287
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,489
Then I have to give a bad review

288
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,866
Can you please stop turning? I'm dizzy.

289
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:01,207
I just want to find something to eat.

290
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,831
Also taking photos

291
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,365
Look at this dish.

292
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,874
What is it called "Never Fish Until Death"?

293
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,082
I think he died with his eyes open.

294
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,285
Look at this again

295
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,115
Still asking for forgiveness

296
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,740
You don't have to apologize.

297
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,411
elder brother

298
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,157
do not

299
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:20,829
Why don't you try the Laughing Dumpling Soup?

300
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:21,948
what is this

301
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,116
I get goosebumps listening to this

302
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,240
I'll tell you

303
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,161
This soup is very nourishing

304
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,832
Last time, a customer took a sip.

305
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:32,449
Swimmed 1500 meters without taking a breath

306
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:33,743
I just want to drink something light

307
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,409
This is light

308
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:35,873
It doesn't look dangerous.

309
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:37,285
Why don't you try it?

310
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:38,743
Come on, look

311
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,038
Come on, here we come

312
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,373
Isn't this the bad luck just now?

313
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,490
Why are you here again?

314
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,286
We'll be in trouble if she's here.

315
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:09,032
Why don't you kick her out right away?

316
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:10,782
The boss is the boss.

317
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:11,497
Where is the boss?

318
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,489
Everyone, don't move.

319
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,243
Hold your breath

320
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,242
If you don't breathe, you won't breathe in the bad luck.

321
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22,244
My little bear

322
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,366
Argonauts

323
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,865
Come to mom

324
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,615
Mother

325
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,990
Orion

326
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,240
Come here soon

327
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,115
What to do

328
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,285
Come and try it

329
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,282
Still eating

330
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:38,702
boss

331
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:39,997
What's this

332
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:42,702
this

333
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:43,788
I'll say it for you

334
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,783
Shoe sole hotpot, right?

335
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,078
I understand your innovation.

336
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,323
You can't put everything in there.

337
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,368
Tofu

338
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:51,160
What

339
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,782
Gluten

340
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:57,782
That's right

341
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,739
tasty

342
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:10,533
You are slow to use

343
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,289
Are you deliberately making things difficult for me?

344
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,580
You still chew

345
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,665
You vomited on me.

346
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,661
I let you give me

347
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,783
Sorry uncle, I didn't mean it.

348
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:49,998
Get out of here

349
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,494
But my mother seems to be here

350
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,161
I told you

351
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:59,911
This isn't your mom.

352
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,664
We

353
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:04,952
Playing

354
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:08,121
We will show you a wonderful show later

355
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:14,123
clown

356
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:15,657
Take care

357
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,203
Walk slowly, walk slowly, walk slowly

358
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,493
Walk slowly. Walk slowly.

359
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:22,536
How many times have I told you

360
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,032
You found the wrong place

361
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,080
look

362
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:27,954
Which of these fish heads and fish brains looks like your mother?

363
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:29,657
Am I

364
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,706
Is it

365
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:38,910
enough

366
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,077
Look elsewhere

367
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:42,081
Don't affect my business.

368
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,956
Then don't eat it, okay?

369
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:48,617
what

370
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,581
That's the sea elf you caught.

371
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,536
That sea elf is mine.

372
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:56,033
But it seems that my mother asked it to come to me.

373
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:57,373
It knows me

374
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,865
It knows you

375
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,748
Give me a break

376
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,990
Call it and see if it responds.

377
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,912
It's true. She can sing my mother's songs.

378
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:10,577
are you crazy

379
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,198
Isn't it just humming? How can it be a song?

380
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:14,039
My mother must have sent it here.

381
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:14,997
Uncle, I beg you.

382
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,864
Who is your uncle?

383
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:16,910
As long as you put it

384
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:17,872
You can let me do anything.

385
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,411
do not move

386
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:26,782
If you say don't move, then don't move.

387
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:28,032
Go, go, go, ignore him

388
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,117
Today, I have to swim back even if it's across the Pacific Ocean.

389
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:32,786
At most, I can travel for six days and seven nights.

390
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,953
Guests, please don't leave.

391
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:35,947
Let them play by themselves.

392
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:37,414
you get what you pay for

393
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:39,032
I told you to choose a more expensive group

394
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,157
Did you listen to me?

395
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,707
The purpose of going out to play is to have fun.

396
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:46,497
good

397
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,615
Come come come

398
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:49,122
Come here quickly

399
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:49,659
boss

400
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,077
Serve the soup quickly

401
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,908
ladies and gentlemen

402
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:56,373
Pay attention, pay attention

403
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,035
Next Steps

404
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:03,364
What you are about to see is

405
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:06,532
you

406
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:07,372
this

407
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,161
Look at this in my hand.

408
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:16,364
Magical magic

409
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:26,332
Don't miss your eyes

410
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:36,282
under

411
00:33:36,292 --> 00:33:38,749
Deep Sea Hotel

412
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,116
Top creative dishes

413
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:52,280
Smiling pimple soup

414
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:55,491
It is not produced in our kitchen.

415
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,663
If it's not made in the kitchen, it's probably takeout.

416
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,990
Boss, that's right.

417
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,410
How good it would be earlier

418
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,874
South River

419
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,240
Come to the kitchen

420
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,990
Come to the kitchen quickly

421
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,582
Come to the kitchen quickly

422
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:13,952
clown

423
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,953
clown

424
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:22,080
What if Lao Jin didn't see that I was busy?

425
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:25,120
Have you thrown away that bad luck?

426
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:28,288
There are so many depressed ghosts outside the window

427
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,782
Throw it out

428
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,660
Not far enough

429
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,866
How can you be so careless?

430
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:35,955
Is it so unlucky?

431
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:37,243
This time it's over

432
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:42,280
Being haunted by a depressed ghost can suffocate you to death.

433
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:43,782
I'll go to the lobby.

434
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,739
Getting ready to weigh anchor

435
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,081
Amitabha God bless you

436
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,495
What's wrong with these two today?

437
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,407
Don't sleep anymore

438
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:21,782
Don't sleep

439
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:25,034
Set sail! Set sail!

440
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:33,914
Faster and faster

441
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,285
strawberry

442
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,286
Uncle and aunt, that's a depressed ghost

443
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:57,624
If you get entangled, you will suffocate to death.

444
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,783
I'm suffocating.

445
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,240
Pedal hard!

446
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:48,532
Sugar Beans

447
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:51,500
The ship is about to sink, so stop making trouble.

448
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,831
Go play

449
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:56,749
Please clean up this red mud quickly.

450
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,036
Don't let the depressed ghost come back to life

451
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,625
You two are brave enough to use this as a facial mask

452
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:03,239
Skin Care

453
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,035
Sugar Melon

454
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:04,997
I'm not full after dawdling for so long.

455
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,160
I didn't have enough to eat.

456
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,156
You didn't eat

457
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,407
Everyone

458
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:11,907
I'm just a jack of all trades.

459
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:12,747
Can you go find the boss?

460
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:13,781
Who knows where he is hiding?

461
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,532
Find him for me quickly. I've been hungry for days.

462
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:23,373
This bad luck

463
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:26,078
It really attracted the depressed ghost.

464
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:29,532
Fortunately, the size is not big

465
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:34,407
uncle

466
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:35,156
Please, uncle.

467
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:36,247
How did you come back?

468
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,707
Just let the sea elf go.

469
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:42,908
It's the only thing that can help me find my mother.

470
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:44,953
Just let it go.

471
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:48,122
Let it go

472
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:50,203
Please, uncle.

473
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,536
You know this sea elf

474
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:53,622
How much is it worth?

475
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:54,740
Also put it

476
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,623
You make money for me

477
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,614
I can

478
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,785
As long as you put it

479
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:01,952
I can stay

480
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,040
What's the point of you staying?

481
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,623
You invite the depressed ghost again

482
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,411
We all have to die here.

483
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:09,247
You mean

484
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,538
I invited the red one.

485
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:14,452
What else?

486
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,413
It likes to pester sad kids like you.

487
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:25,534
Don't be afraid, I'm just trying to scare you.

488
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:27,658
The depressed ghost comes to make trouble for no reason

489
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,327
We are happy

490
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,412
Happy and depressed ghosts will naturally run away

491
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:34,748
Happy

492
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,619
How did this happen?

493
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:39,705
Where is the boss?

494
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,198
Don't let him get away

495
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,160
Stay happy

496
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:44,828
Just stay happy and you'll be fine

497
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:46,247
Ladies and gentlemen

498
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,457
Just be patient

499
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,915
I promise this will never happen again.

500
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:51,906
I promise

501
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:53,077
Don't say those useless things

502
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,163
We want to drink pimple soup

503
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:54,872
right

504
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:55,705
Dumpling Soup

505
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,244
Why didn't you bring out such a good thing earlier?

506
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,912
This soup

507
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,748
It's not cheap

508
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,739
You should have said it earlier.

509
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,910
I want five bowls

510
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:08,032
I want ten bowls

511
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:09,657
I've got it all

512
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:11,123
Soup

513
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:32,077
uncle

514
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:36,829
Can you release the sea elf?

515
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:39,911
Could you please stop mentioning this?

516
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:42,749
Don't worry, let me think about it.

517
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:51,080
This kid is very cute. Look at his little appearance.

518
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:54,873
Do you think this will work?

519
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:56,160
This sea elf?

520
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:57,782
Lend it to me for two days.

521
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,624
You just help out in the kitchen.

522
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,782
Look, there's nothing on it.

523
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,411
Wait until our rating reaches five stars

524
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:06,782
I put it away immediately

525
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:08,282
what do you think

526
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:09,031
Really

527
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:10,327
That's not good.

528
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:13,033
Our business is most concerned about reputation

529
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,036
Then you won't eat it?

530
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:16,157
Eat it

531
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:18,119
This is a mascot.

532
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,741
I couldn't wait to serve it and I ate it

533
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,082
Let's work hard together and it will be yours soon.

534
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:26,576
good

535
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:28,156
make a deal

536
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:29,367
Do your best.

537
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:30,410
Thank you uncle

538
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:32,948
Okay, okay, don't call me uncle all the time.

539
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:34,368
Nanhe

540
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:35,702
Thanks

541
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:36,948
Uncle Nanhe

542
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,453
Count it down.

543
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,494
excuse me

544
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,161
You really want to keep her here.

545
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:46,657
She wants to invite the depressed ghost again

546
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:48,282
So I have to coax her.

547
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:51,284
As long as she is happy, the depressed ghost will not appear

548
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:52,907
After five days, the ship will dock.

549
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:54,498
Throw it as far as you can for her.

550
00:41:57,292 --> 00:41:58,657
Orion

551
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:00,373
What a nice name.

552
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:02,741
My name is Ahua and I am the best at making dolls.

553
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,412
I'm Lao Li. Do you like eating blue bean buns?

554
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:06,497
Oyster Ice Cream

555
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,832
I did it

556
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:10,118
What's going on with you guys?

557
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:10,955
Stop chatting. Hurry up.

558
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:13,620
I understand. Lao Jin, don't be so harsh on the child.

559
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:15,456
Let's go, let's go to work

560
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,240
Thank you for your hard work here.

561
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,206
It's better to save money

562
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:01,953
It's okay. It's safe.

563
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,407
sorry

564
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:09,953
No problem, smiling service

565
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,532
Perfect

566
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:21,206
not angry

567
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,956
Go

568
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,365
Finally two stars

569
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,580
it is true

570
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,532
For me

571
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:55,955
Three stars

572
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,035
Water fight

573
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:19,406
Stop playing

574
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,581
Get rich

575
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,239
Orion

576
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,239
Hurry up, please.

577
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:36,744
So stupid

578
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:42,825
I will be able to get rid of this unlucky burden of yours soon.

579
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:48,948
Perfect

580
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:23,867
Nanhe has made a new animation, go watch it now

581
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:27,324
On the vast ocean

582
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:31,451
The handsome captain of the Nanhe and his brave crew

583
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:35,451
Looking for the treasure left by Captain Nemo

584
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:37,995
Mysterious stars

585
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:52,656
come on

586
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,619
I'm really handsome

587
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,073
A depressed ghost

588
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:09,707
The brave crew heads towards the stars

589
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:10,948
go ahead

590
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:17,409
Defeat the Desperate Ghost

591
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,036
It hurts so much

592
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:27,830
Mother

593
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,915
I want my mother

594
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:34,201
The depressed ghost painted on the star looks like you

595
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,323
What are you doing here?

596
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:37,699
There are a lot of dishes to be washed. Go back and wash them.

597
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,456
We'll dock tomorrow.

598
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:42,323
Don't cause trouble at this time

599
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,957
Today, no one is working.

600
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:48,698
Open a party

601
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,289
What's the meaning

602
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:54,198
Everyone, listen carefully.

603
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:55,448
This is unlucky.

604
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:57,206
This can

605
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:58,243
Orion

606
00:46:58,792 --> 00:46:59,998
Orion

607
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,286
Although she has caused us a lot of trouble

608
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:04,369
But you still try hard.

609
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:05,823
from now on

610
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:08,245
Everyone treats her as a family member

611
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:11,665
We are a family

612
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:36,948
cheers

613
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:38,949
Cheers Cup

614
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:47,701
We've all left, but we still have to go to work tomorrow.

615
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:52,159
Are you happy that Cangsu will soon be a five-star star?

616
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:54,536
Well done, Shensu.

617
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:56,373
You kid

618
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:58,036
Pretty sensible

619
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:01,244
Sometimes

620
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,786
You're not really laughing

621
00:48:04,958 --> 00:48:06,914
Look at our service industry.

622
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:08,994
Your smile is so insincere

623
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:11,116
The guests can feel it.

624
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:12,743
you see me

625
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:15,538
Yes or no

626
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,540
Do you have anything happy? Think about it.

627
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:22,658
So let me tell you a joke

628
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:25,033
I see if you are happy

629
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:32,496
There used to be a little white seal on our boat.

630
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:35,370
It loves to laugh.

631
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,574
Not as introverted as you.

632
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,368
Then I asked it

633
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,581
Little seal!

634
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:43,198
You are so happy every day

635
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:45,449
Any secrets?

636
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,080
it says

637
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,331
It says boss

638
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:50,947
I

639
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,741
I'm a Samoyed

640
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:01,199
I look like this

641
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,161
Tongue cramp

642
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:14,198
That's right.

643
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:58,539
The weather is fine

644
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:01,703
go home

645
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,873
go home

646
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:38,493
What’s wrong with you

647
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:13,448
What's the smell?

648
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:15,198
Soup

649
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,073
Dumpling Soup

650
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,448
The sea elf escaped

651
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:20,914
Go call Nanhe

652
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,456
baby

653
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:26,994
I called out

654
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,490
Do you dare to promise?

655
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,365
Nanhe, have you drunk the soup?

656
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:32,115
baby

657
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:40,366
Nanhe, wake up.

658
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:48,869
my God

659
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,331
Don't chase me

660
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:52,198
I didn't make soup with you.

661
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,323
Don't leave.

662
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,948
You thief

663
00:52:57,958 --> 00:52:59,448
You promised me you wouldn't hurt it.

664
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:01,369
you shut up

665
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:04,913
I just use it to make soup, what's wrong?

666
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:09,573
I get up early and stay up late every day just to pay off the loan

667
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:13,451
You let me go before I could save enough money.

668
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,322
But that's the only way to find my mom

669
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:21,496
Stop dreaming, it's a sea elf

670
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,617
Everything you see is an illusion. It's fake.

671
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:27,947
If your mother really wanted to find you, she would have come here by herself a long time ago

672
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:28,822
No

673
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,368
Mom made it happen.

674
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,832
Even then it ran away

675
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:34,289
I ran away, do you understand?

676
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:37,495
If you run away, it means your mother doesn't want you anymore.

677
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,115
Will not

678
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,324
My mother won't give up on me.

679
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:44,323
I don't trust you anymore

680
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,490
You only have money in your eyes

681
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,081
What did you say

682
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:51,949
I only have money in my eyes

683
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:55,155
I lied to you from the beginning.

684
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:12,038
Pull her down to the shore. We don't need you.

685
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,824
Uncle and aunt, please take care.

686
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,699
Come back next time and take your time

687
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:27,406
baby

688
00:55:27,417 --> 00:55:28,623
Mother

689
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:29,531
We're going home

690
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:31,533
Play for a while longer?

691
00:55:31,542 --> 00:55:33,749
It's too late. We need to go eat.

692
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,081
Just one minute

693
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:36,414
It's dark now.

694
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,203
Just one second

695
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:22,871
The boss's business is good. It's four stars.

696
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,490
You guys move faster

697
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:33,082
You're not thinking of catching another sea elf, are you?

698
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:37,785
Be content. This money is enough to sustain us for a while.

699
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:40,124
I will do business honestly in the future.

700
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:42,582
Caution is the boat

701
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:47,285
look

702
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:48,452
Thanks for listening to you.

703
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:50,995
I coaxed her along the way so nothing happened.

704
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:55,495
Going away

705
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,286
hurry up

706
00:58:02,292 --> 00:58:04,203
quick

707
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:05,914
hurry up

708
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:12,780
Nanhe, why are you still standing there? Come up quickly.

709
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:13,656
Come on

710
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,410
South River

711
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,367
I said, who is this person who is so unhappy?

712
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,785
As for that?

713
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:14,864
She poked the hornet's nest of the depressed ghost

714
00:59:17,292 --> 00:59:18,748
Lao Jin

715
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,449
Old Jin, how do you drive this boat?

716
01:00:00,042 --> 01:00:01,578
money

717
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:40,409
I'm so unlucky.

718
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:50,158
South River

719
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:52,658
I'm also free

720
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:26,703
persist in

721
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:31,248
South River

722
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:33,448
South River

723
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:43,289
Aunt Huahua

724
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:46,491
Did you see the South River?

725
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:49,119
No, no.

726
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,452
Wealthy

727
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,740
careful

728
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:54,910
Slower

729
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,285
South River

730
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,160
South River

731
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:46,788
South River

732
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:49,535
You are here

733
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,160
sorry

734
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,867
You've lost all your money saving me.

735
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:00,706
Are you OK

736
01:03:03,792 --> 01:03:05,123
Is it okay?

737
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:08,241
Look at my injury. Look at my injury.

738
01:03:11,042 --> 01:03:13,249
Really sorry

739
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:14,740
sorry

740
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,616
Is it any use if you keep saying sorry?

741
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:19,240
Look, you destroyed my boat.

742
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,615
Take a look

743
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:25,865
Look at this

744
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:36,785
I tell you

745
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:38,243
I didn't save you for nothing

746
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:42,489
You have to compensate me for my losses, you hear me?

747
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:44,456
You have to find me a place.

748
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:48,079
Doesn't the sea elf sing your mother's song?

749
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,073
Anyway, you can hear it, right?

750
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,707
Help us find the Eye of the Deep

751
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:01,410
We're even.

752
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,741
Eye of the Deep

753
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:08,493
That is in the deepest part of the ocean

754
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,822
All sea elves go there in the end

755
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:15,746
If you find it, will you still worry about not being able to see your mother?

756
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:17,364
Really

757
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:18,785
Yes

758
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:20,373
Wait till then.

759
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:23,367
I'll make my fortune, you go find your mother

760
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:24,998
Win-win

761
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,365
South River

762
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:35,906
What

763
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,786
Go to Eye of the Deep

764
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,660
You're crazy about money.

765
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:42,283
Isn't it just going to the fishery to catch some seafood?

766
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:44,408
We can't always be without signature dishes on the Deep Sea.

767
01:04:44,417 --> 01:04:46,703
If you want to go, go by yourself. I won't take the risk with you.

768
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:47,872
no

769
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:50,287
Besides, who can find it?

770
01:04:50,292 --> 01:04:51,327
She

771
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,706
I Nanhe

772
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:56,124
Can I really help you?

773
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:59,286
Our future good days

774
01:04:59,292 --> 01:05:01,499
But we're counting on you

775
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:07,240
etc.

776
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,241
You take her to catch sea elves

777
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,787
What if I encounter a depressed ghost again?

778
01:05:11,792 --> 01:05:13,282
Without her, we can't find the sea elves.

779
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:14,407
I think you are crazy

780
01:05:14,417 --> 01:05:15,247
High risk, high reward?

781
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,615
Our broken ship

782
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,365
It will be crushed into an urn in the deep sea.

783
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:19,831
I'm going to repair the boat

784
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,115
I'll come back to reward you

785
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:27,203
How can I hear it, right?

786
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,407
The brave crew

787
01:05:30,417 --> 01:05:33,033
Do you hear the call of wealth?

788
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:35,499
Let us look to the Eye of the Deep

789
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,537
Let’s go

790
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:41,033
Congratulations on your fortune

791
01:05:41,042 --> 01:05:43,624
Congratulations on making a fortune

792
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:45,661
But the peaceful days

793
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:47,748
Daydreaming

794
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,615
What a fool.

795
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:51,866
What the hell is Eye of the Deep Sea?

796
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:53,785
Isn't it enough to suffer a loss?

797
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:57,533
I also know that sometimes

798
01:05:57,542 --> 01:05:59,658
This road is not easy to walk

799
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,410
Full of

800
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:03,782
Thorn

801
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:07,660
But isn't life an adventure?

802
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:11,993
There are countless surprises waiting for you

803
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:14,289
I don't want to miss them

804
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,991
Take a rest, Shensu

805
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,991
What happened? Did you hear it?

806
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,581
Eat it while it's hot

807
01:07:32,042 --> 01:07:34,283
It's already late, and we still have time to eat

808
01:07:34,292 --> 01:07:35,657
Are you done yet?

809
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:38,867
Lao Jin has a sharp tongue but a soft heart

810
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:40,740
Did she say left or right?

811
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,365
Did you remember it correctly?

812
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:49,328
Lao Jin, how do you drive your boat?

813
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:56,204
Amitabha God bless you

814
01:07:59,917 --> 01:08:01,123
You're done!

815
01:08:47,292 --> 01:08:48,281
Mother

816
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:50,822
Mother

817
01:09:02,792 --> 01:09:04,077
South River

818
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:09,573
Don't go

819
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,492
Don't leave me alone

820
01:09:16,042 --> 01:09:18,328
do not leave Me

821
01:09:20,625 --> 01:09:21,990
persist in

822
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,455
arrive

823
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:32,115
Are you hungry?

824
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:34,956
It's really cold here.

825
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:35,993
fine

826
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:37,072
Put on

827
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,331
You must be hungry.

828
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:43,746
I'll give you a full banquet

829
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:51,365
Snowing

830
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,243
South River

831
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:06,780
Where is this that you drew?

832
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:07,913
my home

833
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:09,243
your home

834
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:11,372
What's wrong

835
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:12,911
it's beautiful

836
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:15,164
Okay

837
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:18,617
It's just a small place on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth lines.

838
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:23,367
What a pity, I can't go back anymore

839
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:26,993
Why

840
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,366
You're looking for your mother so hard.

841
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,240
Then when you see your mother

842
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:42,786
What do you want to say to her?

843
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:45,073
I don't know either

844
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:49,822
that is

845
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:52,539
sometimes

846
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:56,040
I feel like I'm doing nothing right

847
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:59,915
It seems like it's my fault that my mother left

848
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:03,456
I wanted to find her

849
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,615
tell her

850
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,081
I'm all grown up

851
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,615
Sensible

852
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,661
So that she can go home

853
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:15,243
Eat noodle

854
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:18,367
Nanhe I know this is useless

855
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:21,370
Mom doesn't want me anymore

856
01:12:22,292 --> 01:12:24,954
Who said that to you?

857
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:25,993
you said

858
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,786
me

859
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:30,665
I'm kidding you.

860
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:34,617
I promise I can help you find your mother, don't worry.

861
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:38,743
But the South River Sea Elves don't seem to have anything to do with my mother.

862
01:12:38,917 --> 01:12:41,454
Otherwise, we'd better not go.

863
01:12:42,333 --> 01:12:44,494
You can't back down at this time.

864
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:47,871
How can we know if there is any relationship if we don't find out?

865
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:51,034
If you can't solve this problem, it will haunt you like a nightmare.

866
01:12:51,042 --> 01:12:52,748
You'll never be truly happy.

867
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:55,366
But what if I encounter a depressed ghost again?

868
01:12:56,583 --> 01:13:00,451
We can't run away, we have to fight it off

869
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:03,950
Besides, you forgot that I have magic.

870
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:05,698
Will split the sea

871
01:13:06,292 --> 01:13:09,250
I'm so powerful, no one can stop me from getting rich

872
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:14,200
I tell you, wait until I really make money

873
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:17,200
I will renovate our Deep Sea

874
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:19,697
Look at that

875
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:25,369
I built a 360-degree panoramic restaurant

876
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:26,948
The kind that can see the stars

877
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:31,621
A group of five-star chefs are waiting for you all day long

878
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:34,578
You can eat whatever you want.

879
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:37,744
I built a children's playground there

880
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:42,574
I built a 100-meter-long water slide

881
01:13:45,833 --> 01:13:48,950
I won't charge you a ticket if you come.

882
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:52,825
If there are no guests by then,

883
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:55,040
Let's travel around the world

884
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,242
I don't need to be humble.

885
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:02,537
You don't have to be so sensible.

886
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:04,994
If you don't want to laugh, don't laugh.

887
01:14:05,417 --> 01:14:07,533
If you want to cry, just cry out loud

888
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:26,374
By then, you won't have to please others anymore.

889
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:31,536
No need for others

890
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:33,248
Alive

891
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:44,749
Go and have a look

892
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:46,831
It seems we have arrived

893
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,956
You are really good.

894
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:09,447
I think this place is not that simple.

895
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:12,916
Nanhe, you have to think about it

896
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,453
What kind of storms and waves have we not seen?

897
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:17,411
When the enemy comes, we will stop him; when the water comes, we will cover it with earth.

898
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:22,123
brave

899
01:15:22,792 --> 01:15:25,704
Brave crew members, please take your positions.

900
01:15:25,792 --> 01:15:27,498
I am Captain Nanhe

901
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,866
Our destination is ahead

902
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,866
Eye of the Deep

903
01:15:31,875 --> 01:15:34,457
The last stretch of road may not be easy to walk

904
01:15:34,458 --> 01:15:37,700
But in order for our Deep Sea to pay off the loan as soon as possible

905
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:39,994
Also to help the little Cangsu find his mother

906
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,663
I ask everyone to be extremely courageous.

907
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:47,200
Deck staff, please hold the rudder tightly.

908
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:50,995
Grandpa Jin, it's time to drink less fake wine.

909
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,456
Come back, we have plenty of good wine.

910
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:53,493
Do you care?

911
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,081
Brothers in the engine room

912
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:57,954
The power of the Deep Sea is in your hands.

913
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:00,832
Tangdouer, take this candy first, you hear me?

914
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,615
Come back and eat

915
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:06,579
Ah Hua leads the catering department well

916
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:10,121
Bring out your usual energy in stirring the noodles and cheer for everyone

917
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:12,992
Don't worry, Nanhe, come on!

918
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,706
For a good day tomorrow

919
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:16,664
go ahead

920
01:16:18,042 --> 01:16:19,202
come on

921
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:35,868
Watch out for bumps

922
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:40,368
seven

923
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:41,990
six

924
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:44,035
five

925
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:45,822
Four

926
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,035
three

927
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,160
two

928
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:10,245
Don't panic, our boat is very strong.

929
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:29,619
A depressed ghost

930
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:32,116
Nanhe is a depressed ghost

931
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:43,078
It's not too late to regret now

932
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:45,119
persist in

933
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,615
do not stop

934
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:50,871
We won't be able to hold on any longer.

935
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,582
It's okay. Hold on.

936
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:55,073
It will definitely pass

937
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:09,199
Nanhe, find a solution quickly

938
01:18:11,542 --> 01:18:14,534
U-turn quickly

939
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:22,040
But what if I encounter a depressed ghost again?

940
01:18:22,042 --> 01:18:24,658
We can't run away, we have to fight it off

941
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:27,116
Besides, I'm so awesome.

942
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:30,413
I promise I can help you find your mother, don't worry.

943
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:32,993
South River

944
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,706
Can't escape

945
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:36,743
Can't escape

946
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,206
We can't escape

947
01:18:39,042 --> 01:18:41,124
persist in

948
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:42,914
Persist

949
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:53,077
I haven't figured out how to live my life yet, and I'm still thinking about being a hero.

950
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:59,117
bring it on

951
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:26,243
South River

952
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:48,364
If you bring the depressed ghost again, we will all die here.

953
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:52,493
You mean I brought the red one?

954
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:53,910
What else?

955
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:57,655
It likes to pester sad kids like you.

956
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:00,457
Don't be afraid, I'm just trying to scare you.

957
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:03,530
The depressed ghost painted on the star looks like you

958
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:06,824
Happy and depressed ghosts will naturally run away

959
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:08,198
Happy

960
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:11,826
I said, who is this person who is so unhappy?

961
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:15,496
She poked the hornet's nest of the depressed ghost

962
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:19,155
So that's how it is

963
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:29,700
Nanhe, come back soon

964
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:32,745
I invited the depressed ghost

965
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:36,949
The depressed ghost is me

966
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:50,576
I have magic

967
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:54,326
Grandpa Jin, turn around quickly

968
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:58,246
We can't go

969
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:00,661
Can't go

970
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:07,871
Can't go

971
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:21,743
it's all my fault

972
01:22:16,208 --> 01:22:19,245
I'm not afraid of you

973
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:31,702
Not afraid of you

974
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:47,619
I'm not afraid of you

975
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:17,662
Persistence is coming

976
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:19,494
persist in

977
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:22,206
persist in

978
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,285
South River

979
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:53,364
look

980
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:55,661
Here we are

981
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,490
South River

982
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:06,365
South River

983
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:09,365
South River

984
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,240
South River

985
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:17,535
South River

986
01:25:20,292 --> 01:25:25,082
Look, we're here.

987
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:12,949
Who are you?

988
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:19,119
Where are you taking me?

989
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:57,614
Mother

990
01:26:58,125 --> 01:26:59,365
Orion

991
01:27:22,042 --> 01:27:25,364
Orion

992
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:31,122
Orion

993
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:32,740
Come to my mother's place to stay

994
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:34,865
Mother

995
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,286
Cake is coming

996
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,536
The cake is here, make a wish

997
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,333
I want to be with my mother forever

998
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:48,323
Okay, we will be together forever and never separate

999
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:50,240
What else can I do?

1000
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:52,740
Can't you help me share some of the burden?

1001
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:54,741
Do you think it's easy to take care of children at home?

1002
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,866
If it weren't for this family, I would have left long ago

1003
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:59,412
Mom, don't go.

1004
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,538
Dad, can you please let mom come back?

1005
01:28:06,542 --> 01:28:08,828
I won't make you angry anymore.

1006
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:14,115
Orion

1007
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:16,241
This is your new mom.

1008
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:19,492
Hello, Shensu, what a nice name.

1009
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:23,241
Are you happy to be a big sister?

1010
01:28:25,125 --> 01:28:26,080
Dynamic Superman

1011
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:28,244
give me back

1012
01:28:28,417 --> 01:28:30,032
This is my mother's red sweater

1013
01:28:30,042 --> 01:28:33,284
Sisters in Shensu must be sensible

1014
01:28:33,292 --> 01:28:35,032
Can't you give in to your brother?

1015
01:28:35,042 --> 01:28:37,033
show me

1016
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,455
Daddy

1017
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:40,744
You should take your child to see a doctor.

1018
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,116
Wrapping myself in that red dress all day

1019
01:28:43,125 --> 01:28:44,365
So lonely

1020
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:45,490
It's not good for her growth.

1021
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,707
The teacher is causing you trouble.

1022
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:49,990
What the hell depression?

1023
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,992
I'm telling you, you're fine.

1024
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:55,995
Just smile more and you'll get better.

1025
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,991
Why are we wasting that money?

1026
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,991
Dad, I know.

1027
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,161
goodbye

1028
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:03,740
Let my mother take you there.

1029
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,365
Yes, let's go together.

1030
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:08,492
No thanks, Auntie. My dad will pick me up.

1031
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,115
Do you like it?

1032
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:14,956
like

1033
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:17,115
Sugar Bean, look what this is

1034
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:18,740
Mom is so nice

1035
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:20,365
There is still one

1036
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:22,957
Today is a very special day

1037
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,115
Finally I'm going to see the sea

1038
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:26,740
I am really happy

1039
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:28,957
Dad, Dad, Hug Your Daughter Tighter

1040
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:30,285

Let me play for a while

1044
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,241
Buy one, kids.

1045
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:45,366
The Legend of Deep Sea Hotel

1046
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:46,740
168 Not expensive

1047
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:49,583
Sorry uncle, I'm just taking a look

1048
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:53,332
If you don't buy it, you'll break it no matter what you look for.

1049
01:29:53,625 --> 01:29:55,832
Go, go, go, it's really unlucky

01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,116

don't want

1056
01:30:18,625 --> 01:30:20,490
Whose cell phone is this?

1057
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:23,956
It's mine

1058
01:30:27,042 --> 01:30:30,364
Someone, help!

1059
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:33,287
Come and rescue! Come and rescue!

1060

Wake up!

Mom, I

1075
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:03,162
What's wrong with you, Shensu?

1076
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,240
Wake up, Shensu

1077
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:09,368
What's wrong with you, Shensu?

1078
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:10,990
sorry

1079

I

1085
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,615
sorry

1086
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:44,740
I'm so unlucky

1087
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:45,364
sorry

1088
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:47,206
I am free, too.

1089
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:55,285
Don't sleep.

1090
01:32:56,125 --> 01:32:58,036
If you die, who can I ask for compensation for lost wages?

1091
01:32:58,417 --> 01:32:59,873
I didn't save you for nothing

1092
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:02,160
Don't sleep

1093
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:07,956
I'll show you a magic trick

1094
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:30,991
Wake up!

1095

quick

1096
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:36,956
Are you hungry?

1097
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:40,615
You must be hungry.

1098
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:42,740
waiter

1099
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:45,616
Let's have a full banquet

1100
01:33:46,375 --> 01:33:50,163
Why is it still leaking?

1101
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:53,662
Don't look at him. This environment is not good.

1102
01:33:54,625 --> 01:33:56,866
This hot pot is ok

1103
01:34:00,208 --> 01:34:01,994
Gluten

1104
01:34:02,167 --> 01:34:04,249
Soft and elastic

1105
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:08,367
What else do you want to eat? How about a roast duck?

1106
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:09,831
No no

1107
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:13,705
No

1108
01:34:13,708 --> 01:34:15,244
not real

1109
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,536
This is not true

1110
01:34:19,667 --> 01:34:23,330
Let me go back

1111
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:27,454
Let me go back

1112
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:34,910
It's a nice day.

1113
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:37,707
Like my home

1114
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:40,957
This season in my house

1115
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:42,831
Nagusa

1116
01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:45,241
Just like the waves

1117
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:48,947
The wind is blowing and my eyes are blinded

1118
01:34:50,917 --> 01:34:53,408
Snow again!

1119
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,912
Just like in the painting.

1120
01:34:58,667 --> 01:35:01,989
If only I had magic

1121
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:06,413
Split the sea

1122
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:08,536
go home

1123
01:35:09,333 --> 01:35:13,326
You have magic.

1124
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:18,240
You kid

1125
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:19,365
Looks OK

1126
01:35:19,875 --> 01:35:21,615
That's the smile.

1127
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:23,411
A bit fake

1128
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,662
You have to be like me

1129
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:35,615
I'll give you

1130
01:35:35,625 --> 01:35:37,365
Tell a joke

1131
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:39,240
I see you happy

1132
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:45,448
Boat

1133
01:35:46,292 --> 01:35:47,623
here

1134
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,285
here

1135
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:54,241
here

1136
01:36:12,375 --> 01:36:13,615
persist in

1137
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:16,457
It's coming

1138
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:19,990
It's coming

1139
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,740
leave me alone

1140
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:23,365
hold onto

1141
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:24,410
leave me alone

1142
01:36:24,417 --> 01:36:25,623
Once upon a time

1143
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:27,616
There is a little seal

1144
01:36:27,875 --> 01:36:29,615
Love to laugh

1145
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:32,115
I asked it

1146
01:36:32,125 --> 01:36:33,740
So happy

1147
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:35,741
Any secrets?

1148
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:37,364
it says

1149
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:42,364
I am only

1150
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:44,866
Samoyed

1151
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:51,740
look

1152
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:54,241
The star on the sky

1153
01:36:54,625 --> 01:36:56,957
looks great

1154
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:07,615
Don't leave.

1155
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:11,117
Don't leave me here alone.

1156
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:13,241
I don't want to be alone

1157
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,615
Don't go.

1158
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:22,243
Don't go, I'm scared.

1159
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:26,492
I don't want to be here alone

1160
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,868
South River

1161
01:37:58,083 --> 01:37:59,664
Wake up!

01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,740
Wake up!

1163
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,365
Wake up!

1164
01:38:06,875 --> 01:38:08,240
Wake up!

01:38:09,875 --> 01:38:11,365
Wake up!

1166
01:38:12,875 --> 01:38:14,331
Wake up!

1167
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:17,286
Wake up!

1168
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:20,118
Wake up!

1169
01:38:21,417 --> 01:38:22,953
Wake up!

South River

1171
01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:36,081
South River

1172
01:39:47,083 --> 01:39:49,495
That's it for Shensu

1173
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:51,410
I gotta go

1174
01:39:51,417 --> 01:39:53,328
Where are you going

1175
01:39:56,125 --> 01:39:56,955
go home

1176
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:00,082
You don't want the Deep Sea anymore?

1177
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:01,243
I

1178
01:40:04,917 --> 01:40:07,954
I want to go with you

1179
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:10,990
I can't take you

1180
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:11,989
That

1181
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,082
I'll see you again

1182
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:16,739
Is it right

1183
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:27,913
Sorry, Nanhe

1184
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:34,491
sorry

1185
01:40:36,625 --> 01:40:39,367
sorry

1186
01:40:39,375 --> 01:40:41,286
Silly boy

1187
01:40:41,292 --> 01:40:44,409
It's really not your fault.

1188
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:49,990
Orion

1189
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,989
look

1190
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,742
It's almost dawn

1191
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,115
South River I

1192
01:41:03,875 --> 01:41:05,365
I know

1193
01:41:05,625 --> 01:41:09,698
Sometimes the world looks grey

1194
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:13,117
Not as colorful as in the dream

1195
01:41:13,875 --> 01:41:16,116
But even so

1196
01:41:16,125 --> 01:41:18,832
There must be some light waiting for you.

1197
01:41:19,167 --> 01:41:22,955
Even if it's just a small moment

1198
01:41:23,833 --> 01:41:25,915
It's worth your effort to live

1199
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:28,115
You must never again

1200
01:41:36,375 --> 01:41:39,663
Nanhe, I know.

1201
01:41:43,125 --> 01:41:43,989
Go ahead

1202
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:47,286
I hope every time you laugh in the future

1203
01:41:47,625 --> 01:41:49,115
It's all sincere

1204
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:52,115
like me

1205
01:42:24,542 --> 01:42:25,748

This season in my house

1212
01:44:45,625 --> 01:44:49,197
The grass is like the waves

1213
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:51,615
The wind blows

1214
01:44:51,625 --> 01:44:53,411
All blinding

1215
01:44:55,083 --> 01:44:56,323
Just like

1216
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:59,324
Like in the painting
