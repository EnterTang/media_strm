00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,150
看起来就像巴金堡的宝石
That looks just like the Gem of Barkingburg,

137
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,552
只是它是黄色的！
only it's yellow!

138
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:20,321
这是一块闪光的宝石
It's the Gem of Flappington.

139
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:22,490
传说当这两颗宝石结合在一起时
Legend says when the two gems are united,

140
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,326
他们变得无所不能
they become all-powerful.

141
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:29,697
真正地？强大到足以让某人成为女王？
Really? Powerful enough to, say, make someone queen?

142
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:32,500
你为什么不打开保险库看看？
Why don't you try to open the vault and find out?

143
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,569
但只有伯爵才能打开保险库
But only the Earl can open the vault

144
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,271
不触发警报
without setting off the alarm.

145
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,374
或者是有个诡计多端的人
Or someone with a very sneaky plan.

146
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:41,276
像你这样的人 亲爱的？
Someone like you, Sweetie?

147
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,278
帮我拿下巴金堡的宝石
Help me take the gem of Barkingburg

148
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,514
我会和你分享权力和宝座
and I'll share the power and the throne with you.

149
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:48,016
你将成为女王
You'll be queen.

150
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:50,018
女王？！成交了！
Queen?! It's a deal!

公主：你非得这么早离开吗？
PRINCESS: Do you have to leave so early?

Un alarma! An alarm! It's coming from the Throne Room!

The Gem of Barkingburg has \h\h\h\h\h\h\hbeen stolen.

394
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:09,408
现在有人坐着鹰式飞机
And now someone in an eagle jet

395
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:11,814
正在把巴金堡升上天空
is raising Barkingburg \h\h\h\h\hinto the sky.

396
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:13,177
\什么？哦 天哪！
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBOY: What? Oh my goodness!

397
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:16,342
小偷可能就是鹰式飞机上的那个人吗？
Could the thief be the same \h\hperson in the eagle jet?

398
00:19:16,342 --> 00:19:17,616
你也许是对的 斯凯
You might be right, Skye.

399
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:21,144
我们被俘了 你们三个该阻止他了
We’ve been captured so it’s up \h\h\hto you three to stop him

400
00:19:21,144 --> 00:19:23,177
帮助巴尔金堡的人民
and help the people of \h\h\h\h\hBarkingburg.

401
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:26,078
但是我们怎样才能把他们救到空中呢？
But how are we gonna save them \h\h\h\h\h\hway up in the air?

402
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:28,616
你已经为这次任务准备了完美的装备
You’ve got the perfect gear for \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hthis mission.

403
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:33,012
所有新的飞行服和高速喷气机！
All new flight suits and \h\h\h\hhigh-speed jets!

404
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:34,682
我们要飞了？！
We’re going to fly?!

405
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:35,583
酷！\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYes！
Cool! \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYes!

406
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,210
如果老鹰喷气式飞机驾驶员\h\h\h\h\h\h\h击中我们 赖德？
What if the eagle jet pilot \h\h\h\h\h\hsees us, Ryder?

407
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,484
你的喷气机有一个超级秘密的秘密模式
Your jets have a super secret \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hstealth mode

408
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,550
所以你不会出现在哈尼雷达上
so you won’t be seen on \h\h\h\h\h\hany radar.

409
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,144

Tracker, your jet is equipped \hwith cables so you can pull

410
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,210

411
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,408

I’ll fly to the rescue! Volaré \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hal rescate!

412
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:55,309
珠穆朗玛峰 你的喷气式飞机是一只爪子
And Everest, your jet \h\h\h\h\hhas a claw

413
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:58,781
帮助你营救漂浮建筑物中的任何人
to help you rescue anyone in \h\h\hthe floating buildings.

414
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,484
在空中 珠穆朗玛峰就在那里！
In the air, Everest is there!

415
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:03,946
斯凯 你需要驾驶你的喷气式飞机去“大鹰”号
And Skye, you’ll need to fly your jet up to the big eagle

416
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:07,748
阻止任何把巴尔金堡升上天空的人
and stop whoever is raising \hBarkingburg into the sky.

417
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,342
你的意思是我得去喝一杯吗？
You mean I’ll have to get \h\h\h\h\h\h\hclose to it?

418
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,408
我知道你害怕老鹰 但我相信你
I know you’re afraid of eagles, \h\h\h\h\hbut I believe in you.

419
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:18,177
记住 这是一架喷气式飞机 不是真正的鹰
Just remember, it’s a jet, \h\h\h\h\hnot a real eagle.

420
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:19,078
可以
Okay...

421
00:20:19,078 --> 00:20:21,045
我们会找到一条离开城堡的路
We’ll find a way out \h\h\h\hof the castle

它将被存放在皇家金库里

774
00:40:31,217 --> 00:40:36,089
让它远离恶作剧者的手

775
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:38,925
我只会用宝石的力量来保护

776

我亲爱的巴金堡人民

777
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:43,429
不像我的坏表哥

表弟 我真希望你没拿走我的小东西

帮我拿下巴金堡的宝石

I'd say that's all the proof you need, Your Highness!

786
00:41:06,486 --> 00:41:08,288
你不能因为公爵的努力而责怪他
You can't blame a Duke for trying.

787
00:41:08,288 --> 00:41:11,691
我当然可以！但是为了弥补你所做的
Of course I can! But to make up for what you've done,

788
00:41:11,691 --> 00:41:14,927
我会给你一个重新开始的机会
I'll give you a chance to make a clean start in life.

789
00:41:22,335 --> 00:41:25,872
继续打扫 珍爪！我们越快结束
Keep cleaning, Jean-Clawed! The sooner we're done,

790
00:41:25,872 --> 00:41:28,841
我们越快能回到弗拉皮顿
the sooner we can get back to Flappington.

791
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:31,344
当你看完甜心的小房子后
When you're finished with Sweetie's pup house,

792
00:41:31,344 --> 00:41:33,846
你可以继续你的下一份工作
you can move on to your next job.

793
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:36,649
擦洗护城河！

淘气的宝贝！

00:42:04,911 --> 00:42:08,047
你知道我不能让你玩巴金堡的宝石

But for being such a loyal pup, how about a new tiara?

805
00:42:12,018 --> 00:42:14,854
我的公主 只知道爪子巡逻队
My Princess, just knowing the PAW Patrol

806
