原计划是1967年 {\fs12}It supposed to be in 67th

57
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,831
到那年 上升二号百分百准备好 为什么 {\fs12}By that year Voskhod 2 could be prepared hundred-per-cent. Why?

58
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:59,338
因为美国人已经开始太空计划 {\fs12}Because the Americans have moved their flight

59

他们正在计划太空行走 抢在我们前面 {\fs12}Now they are planning their spacewalk before us

00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:05,389
这不能接受 {\fs12}It's unacceptable

61
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:08,633
但是让尚未准备妥当的飞船进入太空 {\fs12}But to allow an unprepared product into space

62
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:13,057
贴着"苏联"的标志 那合适吗 {\fs12}With "USSR" letters on its broadside... Is acceptable?

63
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:16,167
万一在全世界面前丢脸 合适吗 {\fs12}To fall flat on our face in front of the whole world. Is acceptable?

64
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:21,882
并收获两具英雄尸体 而不是活着的英雄和宇航员 {\fs12}And get to heroic corpses instead of two alive heroes and cosmonauts

65
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:24,513
我们将尽可能仔细地准备太空船 {\fs12}We'll prepare the spacecraft as carefully as we can

66
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:26,239

上升限度真的很低 风越来越大 {\fs12}The ceiling is really low. And the wind is increasing.

76
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:29,189
多低? - 上升限度是1300英尺 没有光隙 {\fs12}How low? - Ceiling is 1300 feet, without light gaps

77
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:32,724
风力12级 阵风 我们要回去吗 {\fs12}The wind is 12 points, gusty. Are we going back?

78
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:34,536
我们跳 {\fs12}We are

79
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:37,345
为什么 和风斗 有乐趣 {\fs12}Why? It's fun with the wind

80
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:42,857
这种风的概率是十分之一 很有乐趣的 抓住机会 {\fs12}With such a wind, it would be fun if out of ten times, at least one was without consequence. Take it!

81
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:48,743
我们在太空中也能后退吗 {\fs12}Will we back off in space too?

82
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:52,254
在太空中 会有不同的指令 廖谢 {\fs12}There will be different instructions in space, Lyosh

83
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:54,794
不然他们为什么选我们? {\fs12}What did they choose us for?

84
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,290
为什么选我们 而不是别人? {\fs12}Why us, why not someone else?

85
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:01,228
我还没想过呢 {\fs12}I haven't thought about that yet

86
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:04,427
因为得处理不可能的任务 {\fs12}To handle impossible tasks

130
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:40,886
请听我说 老实说 那不是他的错 我先跳的 你明白 {\fs12}Please, listen! That's not his fault, honestly. I jumped first, you understand...

但我们没有权利减慢治疗过程 {\fs12}But we have no right to slow down the program

136
00:14:58,222 --> 00:15:00,420
你现在先和赫鲁诺夫上校训练 {\fs12}You are training with Khrunov for now

137
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:01,864
是 长官 {\fs12}Yes, sir

138
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,195
晚饭快凉了 {\fs12}The dinner is getting cold

139
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:27,812
看起来像 {\fs12}Looks like it

140
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:30,443
斯维塔 我告诉过你 "看起来像" {\fs12}Sveta, I've already told you, that "looks like it"

141
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:32,014
是对艺术家最糟糕的赞美 {\fs12}Is the worst compliment for an artist

142
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,187
对艺术家不算恭维 但你是拿画笔的宇航员 {\fs12}It's not a compliment for an artist, but it's for a cosmonaut with a paintbrush

143
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:39,147
意思是有潜力成为好艺术家的人 {\fs12}Who, by the way, could have become a very good artist

144
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:42,352
你挡住了我的光 但是太空呢  {\fs12}Please, you're blocking my light... But what about space?

145
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,237
对于真正的艺术家 为了进入太空 {\fs12}For a real artist, in order to get into space

146
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:49,483
没有必要乘火箭前往吧 {\fs12}It's not necessary to fly there on a rocket

147
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,597
但我看穿天花板 望见天空的星星 {\fs12}But I see the stars throught the ceiling

148
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:55,130
不 其实... {\fs12}No, it's rather...

149
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,356
我看不到天花板 只有天空 {\fs12}I don't see the ceiling, but only the sky

150
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:03,354
我会骑自行车到达月球 {\fs12}I would.. I would reach the Moon on a bike

151
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:05,995
但没有这样的自行车 {\fs12}But there are not such bikes

152
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:07,525
晚餐准备好了 {\fs12}Dinner is ready!

153
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:08,738
爸爸 我可以吃苹果吗 {\fs12}Oh, daddy, may I take the apple?

154
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:12,867
晚饭后 - 我们现在去吃饭吧 {\fs12}Hey, after dinner - So let's go have dinner now

155
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,267
你好 {\fs12}Hiya!

156
00:16:50,437 --> 00:16:52,617
我明白了 {\fs12}Well, I see...

157
00:16:52,868 --> 00:16:54,769
继续保持沉默吧 {\fs12}Right, keep silent

158
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:57,237
我来说话 {\fs12}I will speak

159
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,232
那么 {\fs12}So...

160
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:05,083
我们启动物理肉体恢复程序 {\fs12}We start the program to restore physical form

161
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:07,270
我只有一次生命 {\fs12}I have just one life

162
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:11,514
只有一个工作搭档 {\fs12}And just one workmate too

163
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,210
我不会和别人一起飞的 {\fs12}I won't fly with others

164
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:17,711
我现在与赫鲁诺夫训练 但这是为了保持训练 {\fs12}Of course, I'm training with Khrunov now, but that's to keep the trainings going

165
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:21,335
你一回来 我们就去找主管 {\fs12}And as soon as you're back, we go to the supervisors

166
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,567
并提交医疗委员会报告 一切都会好的 {\fs12}And file a report for the medical board, understand, and everything will be fine

167
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:27,996
这很好 你没有骨折吧? {\fs12}That's good that you don't have a fracture, right?

168
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:29,527
真的很好 {\fs12}That's really good!

169
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:31,726
旧伤更严重了 但那是... {\fs12}An old injure got worse, but that is...

170
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:34,424
一件小事 这是"关闭" 就是愈合 {\fs12}That's such a trifle, that's "off", it'll heal up

171
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,024
有些人的脑袋都裂了但你只坏了一条腿 {\fs12}Some people get their head split open. But you a leg

172
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:41,098
阿列克谢 看着我 听我说 {\fs12}Alexey, look at me and hear me

173
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,648
我将和你一起飞翔 {\fs12}I will fly with you nowhere

174
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:46,000
为什么我这么讨厌你? {\fs12}And why do I disgust you so much?

175
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:48,662
才不是 {\fs12}That's not it

176
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:51,503
你不恐惧 这很糟糕 {\fs12}You have no fear, and that's bad

177
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,208
我给你说个故事 我的童年... {\fs12}Hey, I'll tell you a story from my childhood...

178
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,382
滚远点 - 你会明白我的意思 {\fs12}Get away! - And you'll understand at once what I'm talking about

179
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:03,671
你不懂我吗 {\fs12}You didn't understand me?

180
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:05,875
别傻了 列昂诺夫 就这么走人吗 {\fs12}Don't be ridiculous. Leonov doesn't leave just like that?

181
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:08,449
等我做件事 然后就离开 {\fs12}I'll do my work now and then leave

182
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:14,460
放松 {\fs12}Easy, easy

183
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,391
很好 摆动 {\fs12}OK. Swing

184
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:23,835
一 二 {\fs12}And one, two..

185
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:25,558
一 {\fs12}One!

186
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:28,346
二 {\fs12}Two...

187
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,548
我帮你 痛吗 {\fs12}Let me help! Painful?

188
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:35,073
滚 {\fs12}Ah! Get away!

189
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:38,205
怎么了 耶夫同志? {\fs12}What happened, comrade Belyaev?

190
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:39,742
赶紧滚 {\fs12}Go away from here!

191
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:43,266
一切都很好 我们没事 {\fs12}Everything is fine, we figured it out

192
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:46,208
滚开 {\fs12}Go away!

193
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:47,594
好吧 {\fs12}Right

194
00:18:55,698 --> 00:18:57,059
你好 {\fs12}Hello

195
00:18:57,084 --> 00:18:59,691
什么 要挠挠吗 {\fs12}What's there? Do you want me to scratch?

196
00:18:59,982 --> 00:19:01,682
你自己挠 {\fs12}You scratch yourself

197
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,825
一小时内 {\fs12}In an hour

198
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:53,315
所有零重力阶段 {\fs12}Why, during all those zero-gravity sessions,

199
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,909
你进入气闸的举动为什么都没有成功? {\fs12}Didn't you have any successful attempts of entry into the airlock?

200
00:19:57,915 --> 00:19:59,821
有什么障碍 少校同志? {\fs12}What is the hindrance, comrade major?

201
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:04,366
原因有很多 其中之一是 {\fs12}Well, there are actually a number of reasons. One of them is... the spacesuit

202
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:07,289
总设计师同志 太空舱虽然外号"雄鹰" {\fs12}Comrade chief designer, it's called "Eagle"...

203
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:09,583
但实际上更像石棉棺材 抱歉 {\fs12}But it's rather an asbestos coffin. Sorry

204
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:12,609
我有个建议 可以吗 {\fs12}But I have a suggestion, can I?

205
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,356
鲍里斯·维克多李维奇 {\fs12}Boris Victorovich!

206
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:20,362
为了拉起绳索 控制动作 {\fs12}So in order to pull up the tether and control your movements

207
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:23,303
需要有更多的灵活性 {\fs12}You need more agility

208
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,875
请注意 连接接头 {\fs12}Here, please, note – linkage joints

209
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:29,354
肘部 膝盖 腕关节弯曲 {\fs12}At the elbow, knee, carpal bends

210
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,270
可获得更大的行动自由 {\fs12}For greater freedom of movement

211
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,091
你自己画的吗 - 是 先生 {\fs12}Did you draw it yourself? - Yes, sir

212
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:35,684
它们与宇航服的总压强有关 {\fs12}They correlate with the total pressure in the spacesuit...

213
00:20:35,685 --> 00:20:43,030
伙计 做这样的航天服需要两到两年半 {\fs12}Boys, making a spacesuit like that will take two or... two and a half years

214
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:45,211
我们没有时间 列昂诺夫同志 {\fs12}We don't have such time, comrade Leonov

215
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:46,679
我明白了 谢尔盖·帕夫洛维奇 {\fs12}I see, Sergey Pavlovich

216
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:50,791
但是如果把绳索附着点移到头盔上 {\fs12}But what if we shift the tether attachment point to the helmet

217
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,153
对不起 什么 {\fs12}Excuse me, what?

218
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:54,409
为什么 {\fs12}Why?

219
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:59,027
宇航员进入气闸 脚先进入 对吗 {\fs12}Our cosmonaut enters the airlock feet foremost, right?

220
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:02,724
我觉得更好的是 如果宇航员能看到目标 {\fs12}I feel, it would be better, if the cosmonaut can see where he is going

221
00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:05,360
所以头部可以先进入气闸 {\fs12}And get into the airlock head foremost

222
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:12,977
同志们 离开我们三分钟 {\fs12}Comrades, leave us for three minutes

223
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:16,247
去吧 {\fs12}Go ahead

224
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:17,613
我吗 - 是 {\fs12}Me? - Yes

225
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,270
你到底想怎么样? {\fs12}How exactly do you want?

226
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,916
头部不先进?请您做一下 {\fs12}Head foremost? You are requested

227
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,428
快 {\fs12}Come on

228
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,055
很好 {\fs12}Well

229
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:35,462
现在请回头面对舱口 {\fs12}And now turn back to face the hatch

230
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:36,430
为什么 {\fs12}Why?

231
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:38,633
关闭外部舱口啊 {\fs12}In order to close the outer hatch

232
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:40,375
手动的 {\fs12}Manually

233
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:42,363
但它是自动的 {\fs12}But it's automatic

234
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,621
自动概率是九成 {\fs12}It's automatic 9 times of 10

235
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:46,943
假设你运气不佳 {\fs12}Let's assume you are out of luck

236
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:53,128
现在想象一下 你穿了一套硬邦邦的宇航服 {\fs12}And now imagine, that you are in an inflexible spacesuit

237
00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:56,114
氧气耗尽 {\fs12}And oxygen is running out

238
00:21:57,718 --> 00:21:59,919
你有想象过吗 - 好吧 {\fs12}Have you imagined? - Yes

239
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:02,131
就这样 你已经死了 {\fs12}That's all, you're dead

240
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:03,973
还有你的队友 {\fs12}And your mate too

241
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:05,835
现在我们懂了 谢尔盖·帕夫洛维奇 {\fs12}Now we know, Sergey Pavlovich

242
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,957
我们继续训练任务 {\fs12}We'll be working on the running task

243
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,458
抱歉打扰你 {\fs12}And sorry for bothering you

244
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,957
谢尔盖·帕夫洛维奇 {\fs12}Sergey Pavlovich

245
00:22:12,406 --> 00:22:15,887
即使穿着盔甲 我们也时刻准备好飞翔 {\fs12}We are ready to fly even in shackles, even in mail

246
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:18,841
既然我们是人类 早就在出生的枷锁中飞翔了(指娘胎) {\fs12}We're already people, who fly in shackles from birth

247
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,486
但试想 如果失去脐带 {\fs12}But imagine, if they were removed

248
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:24,278
会是... {\fs12}What would be...

249
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:32,241
我们会失去平衡 并崩溃 {\fs12}We'd lose balance and crash

250
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:35,945
这就是人类 {\fs12}That's who we are

251
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:38,428
去吧 {\fs12}Go

252
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:39,794
是 长官 {\fs12}Yes, sir

253
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:42,350
蓝图 {\fs12}The drawing

254
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:44,070
留下 {\fs12}Leave it

255
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,314
切斯拉夫·阿纳托利耶维奇 {\fs12}Yevgeny Anatolievich

256
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:08,276
耶夫发神经了 {\fs12}Belyaev is bad!

257
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:09,656
如何啊? {\fs12}How?

258
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:25,206
耶夫同志 {\fs12}Comrade Belyaev

259
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,732
亲爱的 你在做什么 {\fs12}Dear, what are you doing?

260
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:34,421
正如你所说 锻炼腿部 {\fs12}As you said, exercising the leg

261
00:23:34,423 --> 00:23:36,869
但我的意思是一点一点地 {\fs12}But I meant little by little

262
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,228
渐渐地 慢慢来 {\fs12}Gradually, with time

263
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:46,344
我没时间了 叶夫根尼·阿纳托利耶维奇 {\fs12}I don't have time, Evgeny Anatolievich

264
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:57,077
惊奇的老飞行员 {\fs12}The old pilot amazes

265
00:23:57,082 --> 00:24:00,889
你知道 我最喜欢你什么 赫鲁诺夫? - 什么 {\fs12}You know, what I like most about you, Khrunov? - What?

266
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:02,368
你的微笑 {\fs12}Your smile

267
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:04,269
再微笑一下 {\fs12}Smile again

268
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:07,478
好一个微笑 {\fs12}What a smile!

269
00:24:19,665 --> 00:24:21,026

819
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,577
廖谢 没有时间了 {\fs12}Lyosha, there's no time at all

833
01:06:13,034 --> 01:06:14,388

赶快 {\fs12}Do it!

836
01:06:30,075 --> 01:06:31,886
没关门吧? {\fs12}It hasn't closed, right?

01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:33,509
没有 {\fs12}No

838
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:36,770
明白了 {\fs12}I see

01:06:36,774 --> 01:06:40,545
所以 我必须转身 手动关闭 {\fs12}So, I have to turn around and close it manually

840
01:06:40,553 --> 01:06:41,941
那行不通 廖谢 {\fs12}That won't work, Lyosha

841
01:06:43,024 --> 01:06:44,722
还有其他选择吗 {\fs12}But what are the other options?

842
01:06:45,303 --> 01:06:46,943
我会打开舱门 {\fs12}I'll open the hatch

现在你什么都没有了 {\fs12}Now you won't have anything at all

854
01:07:08,546 --> 01:07:10,862
你可以把我和气闸一起吹走 {\fs12}So, you can blow me off together with the airlock

855
01:07:10,863 --> 01:07:12,583
你是牛头 {\fs12}You're bull-headed!

都只进行过实验 {\fs12}Only until this stage

921
01:12:36,241 --> 01:12:40,252
我们不知道释放气闸后的真实情况 {\fs12}We don't know what can happen after blowing off the airlock

922
01:12:40,257 --> 01:12:42,491
做好一切准备 {\fs12}Be ready for everything

转角多少?阿尔玛兹? {\fs12}How much has it spun? Almaz?

933
01:13:28,796 --> 01:13:30,314
大约 {\fs12}Approximately...

934
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,434
概约20度 {\fs12}20 degrees on the contour

01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,835
可以打开自动定向 会稳定的 {\fs12}We can turn on the auto-orientation, it will stabilize

936
01:13:35,839 --> 01:13:39,531
这样会烧掉所有手动着陆的燃料? {\fs12}And burn all the fuel intended for a manual landing?

937
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,977
谢尔盖·帕夫洛维奇 自动定位我可以用脖子保证 {\fs12}Sergey Pavlovich, I can put my neck on the line for the automation

我们去兜风吧? {\fs12}Let's go for a spin?

943
01:14:01,047 --> 01:14:03,879
进入着陆区之前 绕地球15圈 {\fs12}It's 15 orbits before entering the landing zone

944
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:06,781
大约22小时 {\fs12}It's about 22 hours

945
01:14:06,784 --> 01:14:08,868
你们怎么想 能忍受吗 {\fs12}What do you think, will you endure it?

946

22小时 {\fs12}22 hours

950
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:21,611
就像去图阿普谢 {\fs12}It's like going to Tuapse

951
01:14:23,034 --> 01:14:24,611
睡在上铺而已 {\fs12}In the upper berth

952
01:14:53,568 --> 01:14:58,147
飞行第20小时 2小时后自动着陆 {\fs12}The 20th hour of the flight. 2 hours to run the cycle of the automatic landing

953
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:49,470
好久没睡了 你得睡觉了 还剩10圈 {\fs12}Hey, it's been long time, you need to sleep. There are 10 orbits ahead

954
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:53,647
必须坚持 我需要完成画作 {\fs12}It will keep! I need to finish the drawing

955
01:15:53,654 --> 01:15:55,303
列季亚科夫画廊等着呢 {\fs12}Tretyakov Gallery is waiting

956
01:15:55,305 --> 01:15:57,675
列季亚科夫画廊? - 你怎么想的? {\fs12}Tretyakov Gallery? - And what did you think?

957
01:15:57,685 --> 01:16:00,442
太空中的第一张画作 {\fs12}The first picture made in space

958
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:04,369
那不是画花盆里的花 {\fs12}That isn't a drawing flowers in pots

959
01:16:04,963 --> 01:16:08,094
他们会把它挂在"松树林的早晨"的旁边 {\fs12}They will hang it right next to "Morning in a Pine Forest"

960
01:16:08,641 --> 01:16:10,719
你知道 他们怎么抢我去艺术学院的? {\fs12}Do you know, how they called me to go to the art Academy?

961
01:16:10,725 --> 01:16:12,569
他们保留了我的名额 直到最后一刻 {\fs12}They kept the place until the last moment

962
01:16:12,576 --> 01:16:15,187
你为什么不去? - 有什么意义? {\fs12}Why didn't you go? - What's the point?

963
01:16:15,189 --> 01:16:17,612
你可以飞行时画画 {\fs12}You can fly and paint

964
01:16:17,888 --> 01:16:20,198
但画画时飞行 不太可能 {\fs12}But paint and fly... It's unlikely

965
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:23,521
他们叫我去古巴 {\fs12}Well... What's about me, they called me to visit Cuba

966
01:16:23,529 --> 01:16:25,079
你吗 - 是 {\fs12}You? - Yep

967

祝贺 {\fs12}Congratulated...

969
01:16:29,537 --> 01:16:32,561

970
01:16:32,566 --> 01:16:36,411
但我在哪里? - 我不知道 你去了什么地方 {\fs12}Ah... But where was I? - I don't know, you went somewhere

971
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:38,000
对 {\fs12}Right

972
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:41,184
勃列日涅夫同时祝贺我 {\fs12}Brezhnev congratulated me at the same time

973
01:16:41,577 --> 01:16:44,234
他说 他会来机场接我 {\fs12}He said, he will come to the airport to meet me

974
01:16:44,244 --> 01:16:47,629
"廖谢" 他说 "就在你下梯子的时候 左手边" {\fs12}"Lyosh," he said, "Just when you descend the ladder, to the left..."

975
01:16:47,635 --> 01:16:51,338
"你会认出我 凭我的帽子" {\fs12}"You'll recognize me, by my hat..."

976
01:16:53,213 --> 01:16:54,656
然后去首都 {\fs12}Then to go to the country

977
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:57,860
不是 首先是克里姆林宫 然后到首都 {\fs12}Not, to the Kremlin first. Then to the country

978
01:16:58,701 --> 01:17:02,012
我宁可你画画 廖谢 {\fs12}I wish you would draw instead, Lyosh

979
01:17:17,536 --> 01:17:18,890
廖谢 {\fs12}Lyosh

980
01:17:21,327 --> 01:17:22,681
廖谢 {\fs12}Lyosh!

981
01:17:24,248 --> 01:17:25,904
你感觉如何?正常吗 {\fs12}How do you feel? Normal?

982
01:17:25,912 --> 01:17:28,252
正常 只是有点反胃 {\fs12}Yeah, just a little bit queasy

983
01:17:28,659 --> 01:17:30,623
但应该是这样的 {\fs12}But it should be that way

984
01:17:31,802 --> 01:17:34,492
氧气是怎么回事? - 等一下 {\fs12}What's with the oxygen? - One moment

985
01:17:36,613 --> 01:17:38,122
不可能 {\fs12}No way

986
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:43,779
近300 {\fs12}Almost 300

987
01:17:43,787 --> 01:17:45,297
打电话 {\fs12}Call

988
01:17:48,985 --> 01:17:50,445
曙光号 这是阿尔玛兹 {\fs12}Zarya, this is Almaz

989
01:17:50,455 --> 01:17:53,486
这里的分压是正常的两倍以上 {\fs12}The partial pressure is twice above normal here

01:17:55,136 --> 01:17:56,748
296 {\fs12}296..

992
01:17:56,757 --> 01:17:58,274
还在上升 {\fs12}And still rising

993
01:17:58,844 --> 01:18:00,198
阿尔玛兹 {\fs12}Almaz's

994
01:18:00,486 --> 01:18:02,764
不要突然运动 {\fs12}No sudden movements

995
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:05,399
没有空气 只有纯净的氧气 {\fs12}There is not air, but pure oxygen

996
01:18:05,405 --> 01:18:08,163
最小的火花 会立即燃烧 {\fs12}The littlest spark and you'll burn instantly

997
01:18:08,395 --> 01:18:09,749
收到 {\fs12}Copy

998
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:11,712
该怎么办? {\fs12}What to do?

999
01:18:11,713 --> 01:18:15,017
关闭主照明 {\fs12}Turn off the main lighting

1000
01:18:15,025 --> 01:18:16,795
准备指示 {\fs12}Stand by for instructions

1001
01:18:17,149 --> 01:18:18,503
收到 {\fs12}Copy

1002
01:18:23,312 --> 01:18:25,061
氧气从哪里来? {\fs12}Where is the oxygen from?

1003
01:18:27,382 --> 01:18:28,848
他们会找到的 {\fs12}They'll find out

1004
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:32,207
有漏点... - 来自背包吗 {\fs12}There is a leak somewhere... - From the backpacks?

1005
01:18:32,215 --> 01:18:34,871
列昂诺夫把背包留在了气闸 那是耶夫的背包吗 {\fs12}Leonov left his in the airlock... So, it's Belyaev's?

1006
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:38,734
值是296?只因为一个背包? {\fs12}And the value is 296 at once? Because of just one backpack?

1007
01:18:38,743 --> 01:18:40,938
或者来自某个补偿泄漏罐 {\fs12}Then it's from one of the compensation leakage tank

1008
01:18:40,939 --> 01:18:43,167
但系统没有任何故障 {\fs12}But there are not any failures in the system

1009
01:18:43,178 --> 01:18:45,660
机舱的严密性也无损 {\fs12}Tightness of the cabin isn't damaged either

1010
01:18:45,662 --> 01:18:49,270
释放的时候 也许舱口移动了 {\fs12}Maybe the hatch shifted away during the blow-off?

1011
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:52,672
但那样会看到剧烈的温度下降 {\fs12}But then we would see a drastic temperature drop

1012
01:18:52,676 --> 01:18:55,937
同志们 他们的脉搏和血压正在下降 {\fs12}Comrades, their pulse and pressure are decreasing

1013
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:58,153
很快就会氧气中毒 {\fs12}It will be oxygen toxicity soon

1014
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:01,239
我们需要中央天花板区的蓝图 {\fs12}We need a blueprint of the central ceiling zone

1015
01:19:01,242 --> 01:19:02,869

1017
01:19:10,341 --> 01:19:14,253
不要试图搜索它 其本身并不危险 {\fs12}It's useless trying to search it, it's not dangerous by itself

1018
01:19:14,711 --> 01:19:19,788
但系统检测到有泄漏 并自动开始补气 {\fs12}But the system has detected the leak and automatically started pumping air

1019
01:19:20,408 --> 01:19:23,115
补偿检测器只能手动关闭 {\fs12}The compensation detector can only be turned off manually

1020
01:19:23,122 --> 01:19:25,017
你得拆开某些东西 {\fs12}You'll have to disassemble something

1021

1023
01:19:29,194 --> 01:19:31,205
还有别的选择吗 {\fs12}Do you have any other options?

1024
01:19:31,631 --> 01:19:32,628
阿尔玛兹 {\fs12}Almaz

1025
01:19:32,632 --> 01:19:35,596
就在你上方 中央天花板区 {\fs12}Right above you, at the central ceiling zone

1026
01:19:35,603 --> 01:19:41,983
补偿泄漏检测器设置在襟翼旁边 用于降压 {\fs12}The compensation leakage detector is set next to the flap for dropping pressure

1027
01:19:43,591 --> 01:19:47,276
除掉部分内饰 {\fs12}Cut the upholstery on the contour

1028
01:19:47,285 --> 01:19:49,825
这是一场赌博 记得 {\fs12}This is a gamble... Remember...

1029
01:19:49,834 --> 01:19:54,967
在装配过程中 技术员死了 但他是个合格的专家 {\fs12}During assemblage, the technician died. But he was a qualified specialist

1030
01:20:02,859 --> 01:20:06,935
布线密度很大 没有工具 没有照明 {\fs12}Do you see the density of wiring, and the have no tools and no light

1031
01:20:08,588 --> 01:20:10,591
上帝 {\fs12}My God

1032
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:15,479
曙光号 我们已经切掉内饰 {\fs12}Zarya, we've cut the upholstery

1033
01:20:15,485 --> 01:20:18,338
探测器系统设置在电线后面 {\fs12}The detector system is set behind the wires

1034
01:20:18,342 --> 01:20:23,630
要做到这一点 需要削减电线绑定 {\fs12}To get to it, you need to cut the binding holding the wires

1035
01:20:23,632 --> 01:20:25,272
收到 曙光号 {\fs12}Copy, Zarya

1036

廖谢 照过来 {\fs12}Lyosh, shine it here

1037
01:20:28,119 --> 01:20:29,768
后果是什么 {\fs12}What will happen with them?

1038
01:20:29,772 --> 01:20:32,307
四肢麻木 {\fs12}Numbness of the limbs at the beginning

你负责照明 {\fs12}And you'll shine the light

1048
01:20:58,229 --> 01:20:59,853
然后他们就会入睡 {\fs12}Then they will fall asleep

1049
01:20:59,857 --> 01:21:01,102
在最后 {\fs12}At the end

1050
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:03,511
入睡?就这样? {\fs12}Fall asleep? That's all?

1120
01:27:13,463 --> 01:27:16,567
如果我们不能帮助我们的同志 {\fs12}If we cannot help our comrades

1121
01:27:16,572 --> 01:27:20,125
我们不要举行过早的葬礼 {\fs12}Let's not hold a premature funeral

1126
01:27:30,299 --> 01:27:33,874
或许在重返大气层的过程中脱离 {\fs12}Perhaps during the re-entry the atmosphere it was off course

1127
01:27:33,883 --> 01:27:36,735
然后坠入计划外的区域 {\fs12}And it ended up at an unplanned area

1128
01:27:36,738 --> 01:27:39,569
你在重复你自己 鲍里斯·维克托罗维奇 {\fs12}You're repeating yourself, Boris Viktorovich

1129
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:41,721
"可能 也许 似乎" {\fs12}"Probably, perhaps, it seems..."

1130
01:27:41,726 --> 01:27:45,547
给我所有着陆可能性的计算 {\fs12}Give me the calculations for all landing possibilities

1131
01:27:45,921 --> 01:27:47,142
当然 {\fs12}Sure

1132
01:27:47,143 --> 01:27:48,247
准备计算 {\fs12}Prepare the calculations

1133
01:27:48,253 --> 01:27:49,710
我们不能再等了 {\fs12}We can't wait any more

1134
01:27:49,715 --> 01:27:52,945
派飞机空中搜索 {\fs12}Let's send some aircraft to search from the air

1135
01:27:52,953 --> 01:27:56,299
谢尔盖·帕夫洛维奇 克宫打来电话 他们要祝贺成功 {\fs12}Sergey Pavlovich, there is a call from Kremlin. They want to congratulate the successful...

1136
01:27:56,308 --> 01:27:57,475

01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:58,313
是 长官 {\fs12}Yes, sir

1138
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,290
他们有参数了 {\fs12}Their parameters!

1139
01:28:00,293 --> 01:28:01,915
他们还活着 {\fs12}They are alive

01:28:01,921 --> 01:28:03,324
他们还活着 {\fs12}They are alive

我们从船上收到 {\fs12}We are receiving from the ship

1142
01:28:05,067 --> 01:28:06,437
信号 有一个信号 {\fs12}Signal, there is a signal

1143
01:28:07,928 --> 01:28:09,989
这是阿尔玛兹 完毕 {\fs12}This is Almaz, over

1144
01:28:10,497 --> 01:28:13,002
告诉他们 科罗廖夫离开去见宇航员 {\fs12}Tell them, Korolyov left to meet the cosmonauts

01:28:13,003 --> 01:28:14,357
阿尔玛兹 {\fs12}Almaz

1146
01:28:15,653 --> 01:28:17,007
我们读取到了你 {\fs12}We read you

1147
01:28:17,398 --> 01:28:20,089
是你们吗 老鹰? {\fs12}We are you? We are you, Eagles?

1148
01:28:20,096 --> 01:28:21,550
在座位上呢 {\fs12}In the seats

1149
01:28:21,554 --> 01:28:23,332
我们没有去任何地方 {\fs12}We didn't go anywhere

1150
01:28:23,341 --> 01:28:25,062
曙光号 这是阿尔玛兹 {\fs12}Zarya, this is Almaz

1151
01:28:26,183 --> 01:28:28,671
我们感觉正常 {\fs12}We feel normal

1152
01:28:28,675 --> 01:28:30,895
还有4圈 {\fs12}Cycle 4 hasn't been run

1153
01:28:31,486 --> 01:28:34,099
重复 还有4圈 {\fs12}Repeat, cycle 4 hasn't been run

1154
01:28:34,387 --> 01:28:37,154
只是逃离死亡地带 {\fs12}Just escaping the dead zone

1155
01:28:38,876 --> 01:28:40,542
谢尔盖·帕夫洛维奇 我 {\fs12}Sergey Pavlovich, I...

1156
01:28:40,777 --> 01:28:42,526
我还没有解释 {\fs12}I don't have an explanation yet

1157
01:28:42,532 --> 01:28:45,424
也许 飞船旋转太多了 {\fs12}Perhaps, the spin of the ship was too strong

1158
01:28:45,431 --> 01:28:47,237
这是特殊情况 {\fs12}That's an extraordinary situation

1159
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:50,019
真的吗 这不是第一次 {\fs12}Oh, is it really? It's not the first

1160
01:28:50,027 --> 01:28:51,604
有人计数过吗 {\fs12}Did anyone count them?

1161
01:28:51,612 --> 01:28:52,966
我有 {\fs12}I did

1162
01:28:56,477 --> 01:28:58,979
尝试重新启动系统 {\fs12}Let's try to restart the system

1163
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:02,063
在下一圈时 即刻降落 {\fs12}And land them on in the next orbit

1164
01:29:03,423 --> 01:29:06,515
我们无权在下一圈着陆 {\fs12}We don't have right to land them in the next orbit

1165
01:29:06,743 --> 01:29:09,328
这艘飞船将通过竞争对手的领地 {\fs12}The ship will be passing rival territory

1166
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:12,062
英雄们该回到地球 {\fs12}The guys should be returned to Earth

1167
01:29:12,071 --> 01:29:14,361
领土问题以后再说 {\fs12}And you will be dealing with the territory later

1168
01:29:14,367 --> 01:29:15,928
曙光号 这是阿尔玛兹 {\fs12}Zarya, this is Almaz

1169
01:29:15,935 --> 01:29:20,314
请允许立即将飞船切换到手动控制 {\fs12}Permission to switch the ship to manual control immediately

1170
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:23,454
并立即着陆 完毕 {\fs12}And implement the landing right now, over

1171
01:29:23,455 --> 01:29:26,885
阿尔玛兹 我们需要计算着陆点 {\fs12}Almaz, we need to calculate the landing point for that

1172
01:29:26,896 --> 01:29:28,357
现在没有足够的时间 {\fs12}We don't have enough time for that now

1173
01:29:28,367 --> 01:29:32,391
谢尔盖·帕夫洛维奇 不用担心 我们有所有的计算 {\fs12}Sergey Pavlovich! Don't worry! We have all calculations

1174
01:29:32,394 --> 01:29:34,675
所以 我 瞎猜... {\fs12}So, I guesstimated here...

1175
01:29:34,684 --> 01:29:37,925
我们将降落在乌拉尔山 彼尔姆区附近 {\fs12}We'll land in the Urals. Somewhere in the Perm area

1176
01:29:37,933 --> 01:29:39,038
廖谢 {\fs12}Lyosha!

1177
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:41,443
理智点 计算结果如此吗 {\fs12}Be reasonable. Is that calculations?

1178
01:29:41,452 --> 01:29:44,278
"他瞎猜..." "彼尔姆区附近" {\fs12}"He guesstimated,""Somewhere in the Perm area."

1179
01:29:44,734 --> 01:29:48,100
另一方面 他们都是经验丰富的飞行员 {\fs12}On the other hand, they both are experienced pilots

1180
01:29:48,107 --> 01:29:52,013
但没有人在手动模式下着陆过宇宙飞船 {\fs12}But nobody ever landed a spaceship in a manual mode

1181
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:55,024
手动控制 我不知道 {\fs12}Manual control, it's like, I don't know...

1182
01:29:55,034 --> 01:29:56,815
就像救命稻草 {\fs12}A straw for a drowning

1183
01:29:56,818 --> 01:30:00,843
完全只为绝望情况设计 {\fs12}Exclusively only for desperate situations

1184
01:30:00,852 --> 01:30:02,414
现在情况如何? {\fs12}And what is the situation now?

1185
01:30:02,417 --> 01:30:03,610
谢尔盖·帕夫洛维奇 {\fs12}Sergey Pavlovich

1186
01:30:03,618 --> 01:30:05,544
来一分钟 {\fs12}For a minute

1187
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:08,294
就是这样 {\fs12}That's it

1188
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:11,472
会议已经开始 {\fs12}The meeting has begun

1189
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:15,917
现在他们会召集大家 {\fs12}Now they will gather everyone

1190
01:30:16,331 --> 01:30:19,284
选择主席 {\fs12}Choose the Chairman

1191
01:30:19,743 --> 01:30:21,417
然后 他们会对着扬声器 {\fs12}Then they will listen to a speaker

1192
01:30:21,427 --> 01:30:23,060
开始讨论 {\fs12}Start the discussion

1193
01:30:24,249 --> 01:30:26,296
你问我为什么不回复? {\fs12}And you asked me why I didn't reply?

1194
01:30:26,298 --> 01:30:29,536
我本该长眠了 {\fs12}I would be pushing up daisies by now

1195
01:30:32,338 --> 01:30:35,089
来吧 我们要降落老爷车 帕夏 {\fs12}Come on, we will land our clunker, Pash

1196
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:37,670
我们曾经降落了很多生锈的铁桶 {\fs12}We landed a lot more rust buckets in our day

1197
01:30:38,006 --> 01:30:39,970
你会着陆的 不是吗 {\fs12}You will land it, won't you?

1198
01:30:43,145 --> 01:30:46,335
我们没有其他选择 - 为什么 {\fs12}We don't have any other option - Why that?

1199
01:30:46,724 --> 01:30:50,295
要么手动着陆 要么永远留在轨道上 {\fs12}Or we land it manually now, or they will keep us in the orbit

1200
01:30:56,739 --> 01:30:59,244
简而言之 就像祖国所说的 {\fs12}In short, as Motherland will say

1201
01:31:02,732 --> 01:31:05,073
你认为他们会不允许吗 {\fs12}You think they won't permit it?

1202
01:31:07,722 --> 01:31:09,133
是我就不允许 {\fs12}I wouldn't

1203
01:31:09,775 --> 01:31:13,366
我们不是仁慈的修女 谢尔盖·帕夫洛维奇 {\fs12}We are not sisters of mercy, Sergey Pavlovich

1204
01:31:13,377 --> 01:31:17,275
国家机密不是实验对象 {\fs12}State secrets are not subjects for experiments

1205
01:31:17,283 --> 01:31:19,967
老实说 我不明白你 {\fs12}Honestly, I don't get you

1206
01:31:20,972 --> 01:31:24,284
或者我明白 但更糟的是 {\fs12}Or I do, but that's even worse

1207
01:31:24,836 --> 01:31:28,123
你愿意让他们留在轨道上吗 {\fs12}Are you offering to keep them in orbit?

1208
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:29,956
我能让你明白吗 {\fs12}Do I get you right?

1209
01:31:29,962 --> 01:31:31,448
我们在打仗 {\fs12}We are at war

1210
01:31:31,668 --> 01:31:33,534
冷战 但相当真实 {\fs12}Cold, but quite real

1211
01:31:33,543 --> 01:31:36,122
万一他们最终落在欧洲呢  {\fs12}What if they end up in Europe?

1212
01:31:36,124 --> 01:31:38,124
或者 上帝保佑 飞入中国(顶这句) {\fs12}Or, God forbid, fly into China

1213
01:31:38,131 --> 01:31:41,739
我们太空计划的所有秘密都将落入敌人之手 {\fs12}All the secrets of our space program will fall into the hands of the enemy

1214
01:31:41,748 --> 01:31:45,698
那又怎样?他们就这样呆着吗 {\fs12}So what? Should they just stay like that?

1215
01:31:45,703 --> 01:31:48,067
这样他们就不会"飞到某个地方"? {\fs12}So that they won't"fly into somewhere"?

1216
01:31:48,068 --> 01:31:49,610
他们是士兵 {\fs12}They are soldiers

1217
01:31:49,897 --> 01:31:54,036
士兵们必须死 为了国家利益 {\fs12}And the soldiers have to die. In the interest of their state

1218
01:31:54,047 --> 01:31:55,401
我明白 {\fs12}I see

1219
01:31:55,707 --> 01:31:57,639
好吧 {\fs12}OK, well...

1220
01:31:57,643 --> 01:31:59,477
这不是新想法 但是 {\fs12}The thought isn't new, but...

1221
01:31:59,701 --> 01:32:02,276
很有建设性 谢谢 {\fs12}Constructive. Thanks. Thanks.

1222
01:32:02,758 --> 01:32:05,733
也许 我会考虑的 {\fs12}Maybe, I'll think about it

1223

1230
01:32:39,077 --> 01:32:41,490
还好不由你做决定 {\fs12}It's good that you're not the one who decides

1231
01:32:49,729 --> 01:32:52,859
"曙光号" 重复 着陆面积大约是... {\fs12}"Zarya", repeat, landing area is approximately...

1232
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,693
廖谢 他们听不到你 {\fs12}Lyosha, they can't hear you

1233
01:32:54,698 --> 01:32:57,184
他们会想办法找到我们的 如果着陆 {\fs12}They'll find us somehow. If we land

1234
01:32:57,193 --> 01:32:58,950
我们就在红场上着陆? {\fs12}Let's land right on Red Square?

1235
01:32:59,656 --> 01:33:02,633
话说够了 开始稳定飞船 {\fs12}Enough talk, start stabilization of the spaceship

1236
01:33:26,566 --> 01:33:28,038
看来我们已经对齐了 {\fs12}It seems we've aligned

1237
01:33:28,045 --> 01:33:30,393
你看 心想事成 {\fs12}You see! You can when you want

1238
01:33:30,395 --> 01:33:32,634
我们现在所需要的 就是回到地球 {\fs12}All we need now is to make it to Earth

1239
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,378
廖谢 {\fs12}Lyosh

1240
01:33:39,387 --> 01:33:40,769
我很涨 {\fs12}I'm crammed in

1241
01:33:41,683 --> 01:33:42,804

1242
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:44,822
我该看到什么 {\fs12}How am I supposed to see?

1243
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,027
也许我该离开座椅? {\fs12}Maybe I should go out?

1261
01:34:37,725 --> 01:34:39,022
那行不通 廖谢 {\fs12}That won't work, Lyosh

1262
01:34:39,029 --> 01:34:39,992
我自己来 {\fs12}I'll do it myself

1263
01:34:39,993 --> 01:34:41,843
你在干什么 重心会转移 {\fs12}What are you doing? The gravity center will shift

1264
01:34:41,853 --> 01:34:43,624
解开座位 {\fs12}Free the seat

1265
01:34:46,114 --> 01:34:47,852
那我该去哪里? {\fs12}So where should I go?

1266
01:34:47,859 --> 01:34:49,813
去那里 在舷窗下 {\fs12}Go there, under the porthole

1267
01:34:50,059 --> 01:34:51,413
我会试试 {\fs12}I'll try

1268
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,955
好的 抓住我的腿 {\fs12}OK, hold my legs

我抓住了 {\fs12}I'm holding

1270
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:59,333
廖谢 我来瞄准 {\fs12}Lyosha, I'll take aim

1271
01:34:59,744 --> 01:35:01,578
我们要非常小心 {\fs12}And we'll very carefully

1272
01:35:02,193 --> 01:35:04,061
安静如同小老鼠 {\fs12}Quiet as little mice

坐回去 {\fs12}Sit back

1274
01:35:05,831 --> 01:35:08,661
快点 伙计 否则我们将登陆中国 {\fs12}Do it quick, buddy. Otherwise we'll land in China

1275
01:35:08,668 --> 01:35:11,573
别催我 如果我滑倒 我们将飞回太空 {\fs12}Don't rush me. If I slip up, we'll fly into space

1276
01:35:31,498 --> 01:35:32,708
慢点 {\fs12}Easy

1277
01:35:32,713 --> 01:35:34,255
回到座位上 {\fs12}Back to the seats

1278
01:35:57,583 --> 01:35:59,268
地球稳定吗 {\fs12}Is the Earth steady?

1279
01:36:00,009 --> 01:36:01,289
在漂流 {\fs12}It's drifting

1280
01:36:01,293 --> 01:36:03,445
多少? - 大约超过7度 {\fs12}How much? - About 7 degrees already

1281
01:36:04,117 --> 01:36:05,507
氮气是怎么回事? {\fs12}What's with the nitrogen?

1282
01:36:05,513 --> 01:36:06,867
几乎为零 {\fs12}Almost at zero

1283
01:36:08,072 --> 01:36:09,805
廖谢 你有连接吗 {\fs12}Lyosha, are you attached?

1284
01:36:10,796 --> 01:36:12,150
是 {\fs12}Yep

1285
01:36:27,721 --> 01:36:29,706
已检测到制动引擎运行 {\fs12}Retro engine run has been detected

1286
01:36:30,295 --> 01:36:33,034
最好知道他们的最终着陆点 {\fs12}It'd be great to know where they will end up

1287
01:36:33,302 --> 01:36:35,643
我们最终会在监狱 如果有万一 {\fs12}We'll end up in jail, if anything

1288
01:36:35,644 --> 01:36:37,090
但他们会降落 {\fs12}But they will land

1289
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:39,478
遥测器探测到一些倾向 {\fs12}The telemetry detected some inclination

1290
01:36:39,484 --> 01:36:42,414
看来 他们离开了自己的座位 自行瞄准了 {\fs12}It seems, they left their seats to take aim

1291
01:36:42,418 --> 01:36:45,284
他们坐回去后 重心将转移 {\fs12}And when they were sitting back, the gravity center shifted

1292
01:36:45,290 --> 01:36:46,793
那又怎样? {\fs12}So what?

1293
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,245
着陆路径可能被改变 {\fs12}The landing path can change

倾角超过六或七度 {\fs12}With the inclination over six or seven degrees

1296
01:36:56,493 --> 01:36:58,183
他们将进入大气层 {\fs12}They will get into the atmosphere

1297
01:36:58,193 --> 01:36:59,844
过于锐角 {\fs12}With a very acute angle

1298
01:36:59,846 --> 01:37:02,207
宇宙飞船可能会弹飞 {\fs12}The spaceship might ricochet off

1299
01:37:02,214 --> 01:37:04,649
再次回到轨道上 {\fs12}And get back to the orbit again

1300
01:37:04,654 --> 01:37:07,513
重力会把它们拉回来 {\fs12}The gravity will pull them back...

1301
01:37:07,516 --> 01:37:09,620
还有时间 {\fs12}But that won't be soon

1302

1306
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:21,774
希望 {\fs12}And hope...

1307
01:37:23,007 --> 01:37:24,501
平安 {\fs12}For the best

1308
01:37:38,764 --> 01:37:40,118
今天是星期四吗 {\fs12}Is it Thursday?

1309
01:37:40,794 --> 01:37:42,148
还是星期五? {\fs12}Or Friday?

1310
01:37:43,231 --> 01:37:44,585
我不知道 {\fs12}I have no idea

1311
01:37:47,029 --> 01:37:49,573
孩子们起床了吗 {\fs12}You think the children have got up?

1312
01:37:52,017 --> 01:37:54,599
我想知道维卡去托儿所还是... {\fs12}I wonder if Vika went to the daycare or again...

1313
01:38:01,466 --> 01:38:02,921
廖谢 别担心 {\fs12}Lyosha, don't worry

1314
01:38:03,555 --> 01:38:06,146
如果我滑倒 那么大约有三年 {\fs12}If I slipped up, then in about three years...

1315
01:38:06,149 --> 01:38:08,428
重力都会起作用的 {\fs12}The gravity will work anyway

1316
01:38:08,435 --> 01:38:10,371
被光荣埋葬 {\fs12}Be buried with honours

1317
01:38:17,906 --> 01:38:19,260
那么 {\fs12}So...

活着吗 {\fs12}Alive?

1335

01:45:35,842 --> 01:45:38,435
为什么凭借苏联科学的力量 {\fs12}Why, with all the power of Soviet science,

1350
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:41,568
我们无法探测到一个无线电信号 {\fs12}We cannot detect one radio beacon

1351
01:45:41,569 --> 01:45:43,568
在给定的正方形区内! {\fs12}In a given square!

1352
01:45:44,398 --> 01:45:48,271
信号在重返大气层时消失了 这可能意味着 {\fs12}The signal disappeared during re-entry into the atmosphere. It can mean...

1353
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:49,657
没可能 {\fs12}It can't

1354
01:45:49,895 --> 01:45:52,169
我们需要特定的版本 {\fs12}We need specific versions

1355
01:45:53,342 --> 01:45:54,696
谢尔盖·帕夫洛维奇 {\fs12}Sergey Pavlovich

1356
01:45:55,717 --> 01:45:58,784
显然他们降落在我们没料到的地方 {\fs12}Apparently, they landed somewhere we didn't expect

1357
01:45:58,789 --> 01:46:02,061
已部署全面搜索行动 {\fs12}A full-scaled search operation has been deployed

1358
01:46:02,064 --> 01:46:04,771
你需要冷静 {\fs12}You need cool it

1359
01:46:04,777 --> 01:46:05,808
并休息 {\fs12}And get some rest

1360
01:46:05,814 --> 01:46:07,680
我会休息的 等我们找到他们 {\fs12}I'll get rest when we've found them

1361
01:46:07,690 --> 01:46:10,073
有什么假设? {\fs12}What are the assumptions?

1362
01:46:10,075 --> 01:46:14,631
首先 信号塔可能损毁于硬着陆 {\fs12}First, the beacon might be broken from a hard landing

1363
01:46:15,106 --> 01:46:18,875
第二 可能内饰已经损坏 {\fs12}Second, they might have damaged it when they were cutting the upholstery

1364
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,406
他们有便携发射器 以备不需 {\fs12}They have a portable transmitter for that case

1365
01:46:21,415 --> 01:46:23,011
手动发送信号 {\fs12}To send signals manually

1366
01:46:23,018 --> 01:46:25,540
为什么不能检测它? {\fs12}So why can't we detect it?

1367
01:46:25,546 --> 01:46:28,363
发射机的电池在低温下不工作 {\fs12}The batteries of the transmitter don't work at low temperature

1368
01:46:28,366 --> 01:46:30,914
那又怎样?他们不知道如何暖和电池吗 {\fs12}So what? It wouldn't dawn upon them how to warm a battery?

1369
01:46:30,923 --> 01:46:33,409
首先 他们必须解决如何暖和自己 {\fs12}First they have to work out how to warm themselves

1370
01:46:33,415 --> 01:46:36,996
太空服 失去了生命支持系统 它不是为低温设计的 {\fs12}The spacesuits, unplugged from the life support system, are not designed for low temperature

1371
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,855
他们无法在舱内栖身 一小时内就会变成冰箱 {\fs12}They cannot shelter in the capsule as well. It will be like a freezer in an hour

1372
01:46:40,866 --> 01:46:44,293
也许 无线电波只是无法穿透 {\fs12}Perhaps, the radio waves just cannot pass

1373
01:46:44,297 --> 01:46:49,188
短波信号的质量很大程度上取决于地形和天气条件 {\fs12}The quality of a short-wave signal depends a lot on a terrain and weather conditions

1374
01:46:49,190 --> 01:46:53,621
在恶劣的天气条件下 {\fs12}Let's say they turned out to be in adverse weather conditions

1375
01:46:54,538 --> 01:46:56,821
他们能撑多久? {\fs12}How long can they hold out?

1376
01:46:57,758 --> 01:46:59,112
一天 {\fs12}A day

1377
01:47:16,819 --> 01:47:19,588
针叶林带 挡住了信号 {\fs12}Taiga. It's turning off the signal

1378
01:47:21,602 --> 01:47:23,407
但我们将使用莫尔斯电码 {\fs12}But we will use Morse code

1379
01:47:23,641 --> 01:47:26,454
我们使用完美古老的莫尔斯电码 {\fs12}We'll make it with good old Morse code

1380
01:47:27,649 --> 01:47:30,973
莫尔斯电码是非常可靠的 {\fs12}Morse code is very reliable

1381
01:47:30,979 --> 01:47:34,067
你最好防寒 阿列克谢 {\fs12}You'd better winterize, Alexey

1382
01:47:34,676 --> 01:47:36,126
没事 {\fs12}It will keep

1383
01:48:40,110 --> 01:48:41,899

1384
01:48:41,905 --> 01:48:43,124
V-N, V-N... {\fs12}V-N, V-N...

1385
01:48:43,127 --> 01:48:45,200
什么是"V N"? {\fs12}What's"V-N"?

1386
01:48:55,814 --> 01:48:57,368
"一切正常" {\fs12}V-N,"Everything normal"

1387
01:48:57,369 --> 01:48:58,895
你有良心吗 {\fs12}Do you have a conscience?

1388
01:48:58,905 --> 01:49:00,742
他们着陆了 我们的老鹰 V-N {\fs12}They've landed, our eagles! V-N!

1389
01:49:00,747 --> 01:49:02,576
什么 - VN代表"一切正常" {\fs12}What? - It's V-N."Everything normal"

1390
01:49:02,585 --> 01:49:04,543
所以你"一切正常"? {\fs12}So you're"everything normal"?

1391
01:49:04,548 --> 01:49:07,165
等等 现在是最有趣的时刻... {\fs12}Hey, wait! It will be the most interesting moment now...

1392
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:10,103
救援行动 - 别担心 没有你 也会拯救他们的 {\fs12}... Rescue operation - Don't worry, they will rescue them without you

1393
01:49:10,109 --> 01:49:12,204
明天 电视上会有一切 {\fs12}They will show everything on TV tomorrow

1394
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:14,382
你为什么总是... - 去吧 {\fs12}Ahh, why do you always... - Go, go..

1395
01:49:14,384 --> 01:49:16,961
干涉国家机密 {\fs12}Enough to intervene in state secrets

1396
01:49:24,215 --> 01:49:25,610
克里姆林宫 {\fs12}The Kremlin

1397
01:49:26,371 --> 01:49:28,829
正在等待正式声明 {\fs12}...is waiting an official statement

1398
01:49:29,247 --> 01:49:32,485
我们必须在明天10点之前完成 {\fs12}We have to do it tomorrow by 10 AM

1399
01:49:32,493 --> 01:49:34,916
我们什么都没准备 {\fs12}We have nothing to make yet

1400
01:49:44,026 --> 01:49:47,008
谢尔盖·帕夫洛维奇 你得好好休息 {\fs12}Sergey Pavlovich, you need to get some rest

1401
01:49:47,737 --> 01:49:49,759
现在一切都取决于你 {\fs12}Nothing depends on you now

1402
01:49:49,770 --> 01:49:53,773
直到早上 都有充裕的时间 如果不浪费 {\fs12}There is a plenty of time until the morning, if we don't waste it

1403
01:49:54,211 --> 01:49:56,616
中将同志 允许我说... {\fs12}Comrade lieutenant general! Permission to speak...

1404
01:49:56,627 --> 01:50:00,550
天气预报来了 预计在乌拉尔山脊上会有大雪 {\fs12}The weather report has come. Heavy snowfall is expected all over the Ural ridge

1405

着陆后6小时 {\fs12}6 hours after landing

1411
01:50:22,119 --> 01:50:26,657
如果搜到信号 还需要大约两个小时的三角定位 {\fs12}If they have got the signal, it's about two hours for triangulation...

1412
01:50:26,661 --> 01:50:29,745
所以他们很快就要来了 {\fs12}So they are going to come soon

01:50:47,768 --> 01:50:49,786
我们知道我们要做什么 {\fs12}We knew what we were getting into

如果他们找到了日记 {\fs12}If they find the journal,

你没事吧? {\fs12}Are you OK?

1483
01:57:29,572 --> 01:57:30,854
不要睡觉 {\fs12}Don't sleep!

别想睡觉 不要睡觉 {\fs12}Don't think of sleep! Don't sleep!

1487
01:57:35,712 --> 01:57:37,066
帕夏 {\fs12}Pash

01:57:38,426 --> 01:57:39,984
就是这样了 廖谢 {\fs12}That's it, Lyosh

1489
01:57:41,684 --> 01:57:43,407
帕维尔·伊万洛维奇 {\fs12}Pavel Ivanovich

1490
01:57:43,659 --> 01:57:45,065
好吧 {\fs12}Alright

1491
01:57:45,068 --> 01:57:47,166
你知道我们现在要做什么吗 {\fs12}Do you know what we're going to do now?

1492
01:57:47,175 --> 01:57:49,426
我们将为记者排练演讲稿 {\fs12}We will rehearse the speech for the reporters

1493
01:57:49,431 --> 01:57:52,339
因为你总是站着 像... - 你自己处理 {\fs12}Because you're always standing like a... - You'll handle it by yourself

1494
01:57:52,343 --> 01:57:53,782
你现在是英雄了 {\fs12}You're a hero now

1495
01:57:53,793 --> 01:57:55,204
我吗 不 {\fs12}Am I? Nah

1496
01:57:55,207 --> 01:57:57,811
当我照顾奶牛的时候 你就是个英雄 {\fs12}You were a hero when I just helped to farm cows

1497
01:57:58,155 --> 01:58:00,190
你已经去打仗了 {\fs12}And you'd already been to war

1498
01:58:00,195 --> 01:58:03,747
你已经飞过多少架飞机了 我只梦见天空 {\fs12}How many battle flights did you already have! And I was only dreaming about the sky

1499
01:58:03,749 --> 01:58:05,103
一 {\fs12}One

1500
01:58:05,532 --> 01:58:06,886
一什么 {\fs12}One what?

1501
01:58:07,289 --> 01:58:08,819
一次飞行 {\fs12}One flight

1502
01:58:11,276 --> 01:58:14,064
我甚至没有开过枪 {\fs12}And I didn't even shoot

1503
01:58:15,030 --> 01:58:19,540
老家伙打仗 年轻人准备飞机 {\fs12}The older guys fought, and we, younger guys, prepared the planes

1504
01:58:19,546 --> 01:58:21,694
横扫机场 {\fs12}Swept the aerodrome

1505
01:58:23,697 --> 01:58:26,665
最后 他们给了我一次战斗飞行 {\fs12}And finally, they gave me a battle flight

1506
01:58:26,676 --> 01:58:29,738
我想 轮到我了 {\fs12}I thought, here is my turn!

1507
01:58:29,745 --> 01:58:31,959
也许我会好好表现 {\fs12}Maybe I'll be useful for something

1508
01:58:32,773 --> 01:58:35,731
敌人没有攻击我们 {\fs12}The enemy didn't attack us

1509
01:58:35,736 --> 01:58:38,345
我们飞回了基地 {\fs12}We flew and returned to the base

1510
01:58:39,166 --> 01:58:41,051
就像我们根本没有飞过 {\fs12}As if we didn't even fly

1511
01:58:43,483 --> 01:58:47,298
第二天 他们投降了 {\fs12}And on the next day they capitulated

1512
01:58:48,337 --> 01:58:50,396
好吧 这是你所谓的"英雄" {\fs12}Well, here's your"hero"

1513
01:58:50,397 --> 01:58:52,112
帕维尔·耶夫 {\fs12}Pavel Belyaev

1514
01:59:05,495 --> 01:59:06,877
你知道吗 {\fs12}Do you know...

1515
01:59:07,615 --> 01:59:09,661
为什么我去了飞行学校? {\fs12}Why I went to flight school?

1516
01:59:09,667 --> 01:59:12,741
为什么 - 津贴比艺术学院更多 {\fs12}Why? - The allowance was bigger than in the art Academy

1517
01:59:14,051 --> 01:59:17,167
现在 我本该照片挂满大街 {\fs12}Right now I would be painting my pictures living on easy street

1518
01:59:17,170 --> 01:59:21,850
但不是 全世界都看到我吊在绳索下 {\fs12}But no. The whole world saw how I dangled from the tether

1519
01:59:21,854 --> 01:59:25,189
太夸张了 我差点在宇航服里拉屎 {\fs12}It was inflated so much, I almost shit my spacesuit

1520
01:59:25,584 --> 01:59:29,058
这就是征服太空的阿列克谢·列昂诺夫 {\fs12}Here is a conqueror of space Alexey Leonov

1521
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:33,005
帕夏 原谅我 {\fs12}Pashka, forgive me

1522
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:36,051
我把你带到这个境况 {\fs12}That I got you into this

还好 {\fs12}That's good

01:59:42,042 --> 01:59:43,972
好什么 {\fs12}What's good?

1526
01:59:44,427 --> 01:59:46,257
还好 {\fs12}It's good that

1527
01:59:47,398 --> 01:59:49,204
你没有成为一个艺术家 {\fs12}You didn't become an artist

1528
01:59:49,745 --> 01:59:52,922
不然我还能和谁一起飞翔 {\fs12}Otherwise, who else would I fly with so well

1529
01:59:58,514 --> 02:00:00,875
也许我们会再次飞翔 {\fs12}Maybe we'll fly again

1530
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:06,830
取决于祖国的说法 {\fs12}Depends on what Motherland will say

1531
02:00:07,586 --> 02:00:10,204
祖国会说什么 {\fs12}What the Motherland will say

1532
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:43,821
他们降落了 {\fs12}They've landed

1533
02:00:44,192 --> 02:00:45,638
成功了 {\fs12}Successfully

寻求救援 {\fs12}Asking for help

1535
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:49,515
但没人会来 {\fs12}But nobody's coming to them

1536
02:00:49,518 --> 02:00:52,146
但他们会来找你 你会进监狱的 {\fs12}But they will come for you, and you'll go to jail

1537
02:00:52,154 --> 02:00:53,803
非常成功 {\fs12}Very successful

1538
02:00:55,017 --> 02:00:58,054
但我没有人可求助 {\fs12}But I won't have anyone to ask for help

1539
02:01:12,462 --> 02:01:14,192
但还有选择吗 {\fs12}But how else?

着陆9小时后 {\fs12}9 hours from the landing

天气转坏 {\fs12}The weather turned bad

1542
02:01:37,084 --> 02:01:39,474
我必须暂停搜索行动 {\fs12}I have to pause the search operation

你想让他们从电台播音员那里听到吗 {\fs12}Do you want them to hear about it from the radio announcer?

1552
02:02:04,195 --> 02:02:05,788
我们收到信号了 {\fs12}We've got the signal!

1553
02:02:06,365 --> 02:02:09,015
谢尔盖·帕夫洛维奇 看起来 我们有信号了 {\fs12}Sergey Pavlovich, it seems... We've got the signal
