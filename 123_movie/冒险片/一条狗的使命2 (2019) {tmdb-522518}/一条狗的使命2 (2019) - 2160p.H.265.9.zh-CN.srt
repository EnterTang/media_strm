1
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,550
{\pos(192,100)}一條狗的使命2

2
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,500
在這樣的日子里
On days like this,

3
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,780
我覺得自己是世上最幸運的狗
I feel like the luckiest dog in the world.

4
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,840
陽光撫背
I got the sun on my back.

5
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,950
清風拂面
I got the wind in my face.

6
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,930
還能坐在這輛
I get to ride in this car

7
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,790
車窗總是放下的車里
where the windows are always rolled down.

8
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,040
我叫貝利
My name is Bailey.

9
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,810
很享受微風徐來的感覺吧  小伙子
You enjoying the breeze, boy?

10
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,170
-我愛我的男孩  伊森  -狗老大
- I love my boy Ethan. - Boss Dog.

11
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,420
-我也愛我的女孩漢娜  -狗老大
- And I love my girl Hannah, too. - Boss Dog.

12
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,650
人老大
Boss Man.

13
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,280
我活過很多次
I've lived a lot of lives,

14
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,010
尿過很多東西
and I've peed on a lot of stuff.

15
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,890
但有件事我一直搞不明白
There is one thing I've never been able to figure out, though:

16
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,650
這里為什么總是這么癢
Why does it always itch right here?

17
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,790
寶寶可以過來了
Baby can come up.

18
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,880
寶寶可以過來這邊了
Baby can come up here.

19
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,280
我得去了
That's my cue.

20
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,280
我干完活就去廚房找你
I'll meet you in the kitchen after I do the chores.

21
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,460
跟我一樣老態龍鐘了嗎  狗老大
You as creaky as me, Boss Dog?

22
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,170
走吧
Let's go.

23
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,880
拜托  早晨的味道最好了
Come on. Mornings had the best smells.

24
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,520
當然了  我們得干活
Sure, we had to do our chores...

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,230
走吧  貝利
Come on, Bailey.

26
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,730
但每次結束時我都能吃一個雞蛋
but it always ended with an egg.

27
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,480
爽
Yeah.

28
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,950
不是吧
Seriously?

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,630
伙計
Hey, buddy.

30
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,880
覺得自己寶刀未老嗎  狗老大
Still think you got one in you, Boss Dog?

31
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,890
好吧
Okay.

32
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,870
準備好了嗎
You ready?

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,150
生來就準備好了
Born ready.

34
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,440
一
One.

35
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,490
二
Two.

36
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,080
三
Three.

37
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,780
上
Go!

38
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,960
干得漂亮  狗老大
Way to go, Boss Dog.

39
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,170
越來越力不從心了
That isn't getting any easier.

40
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,670
越來越力不從心了
That isn't getting any easier.

41
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,990
寶刀未老啊  狗老大
You still got it, Boss Dog.

42
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,180
是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

43
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,600
好孩子
Good boy.

44
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,810
來吧  我們進屋
Come on, let's go to the house.

45
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,270
來吧  伙計  來吧
Come on, buddy. Come on.

46
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,400
來吧
Come on.

47
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,820
來吧  培根  來吧  培根
Come on, bacon. Come on, bacon.

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,240
不是培根  但也能吃
It's not bacon, but I'll take it.

49
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,700
早上好
Morning.

50
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,580
-媽媽  你好  -你好
- Hi, Mommy. - Hi.

51
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,040
早上好  格洛麗亞
Morning, Gloria.

52
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,630
漢娜  她什么時候醒的
What time did she wake up, Hannah?

53
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,100
當時沒看時間
Wasn't looking at the clock.

54
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,770
但不要緊
Doesn't matter, though.

55
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,900
我們和小孫女玩得很開心
We're having fun with our granddaughter.

56
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,300
漢娜曾有一個叫亨利的兒子
Hannah used to have a boy named Henry.

57
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,340
他把格洛麗亞帶到了我們家
He brought Gloria into our pack.

58
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,800
一直喂她吃松餅  她就要變成小胖妞了
We keep feeding her pancakes, she's gonna get chubby.

59
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,100
也許這次她會給我點吃的
Maybe this time she'll give me a treat.

60
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,040
沒有吃的  好吧
No? No treat? Okay.

61
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,150
我還以為就是要把小寶寶喂得胖乎乎的
I thought little babies were supposed to be chubby.

62
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,940
伊森  噓
Ethan, shh.

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,090
漢娜最近經常說"噓"
Hannah made that "shh" sound a lot lately.

64
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,340
-這是誰  -爸爸
- Who's that? - Daddy.

65
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,010
爸爸  我覺得她遺傳了亨利的眼睛
Daddy. You know, I think she has Henry's eyes.

66
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,640
亨利離開了家  再也沒有回來
Henry went away and never came back.

67
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,290
漢娜為此整天以淚洗面
Hannah cried a lot.

68
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,010
我整天舔她的臉
I licked her face a lot.

69
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,560
真希望兒子還活著
I wish my son was alive

70
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,460
見見他可愛的女兒
to see his adorable daughter.

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,310
她丟地上  我吃掉
She drops it, I eat it.

72
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,170
-這是我們的約定  -掉到地上了
- That's our deal. - It fell.

73
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,030
橙色  紫色
Orange. Purple.

74
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,720
格洛麗亞喜歡把吃的放在臉上
Gloria liked to wear food on her face.

75
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,160
-但不是好吃的  -你好
- But not good food. - Hello?

76
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,860
一條惡心的狗剛剛在舔我的臉
A... a gross dog just licked my face.

77
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,210
不  被困在農場就會發生這樣的事
No, no, that's-that's how it goes when you're stuck on a farm.

78
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,820
CJ  你要去哪
CJ, where are you going?

79
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,420
我們應該在這玩
We're supposed to play here.

80
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,000
在芝加哥遇到什么事了
What's happening in Chicago?

81
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,200
一五一十地告訴我  一邊去
Tell me everything. Go away.

82
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,700
你們要出去玩嗎
Are you guys going out?

83
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,880
我看見馬馬了
I see the horsey.

84
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,600
不  別進去
No, don't go in there.

85
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,400
CJ  停下
CJ, stop.

86
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,290
他很害怕
He's scary.

87
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,500
吁  伙計  吁
Whoa, boy. Whoa.

88
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,520
伊森氣喘吁吁的樣子
From the way he was breathing,

89
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,550
能看出來他很害怕
I knew Ethan was scared.

90
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,610
不知道  我感覺...
I don't know. I feel like...

91
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,720
你在做什么
What are you doing?

92
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,390
等會打回給你
Hey, let me call you back.

93
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,520
CJ剛剛跑到萊納斯那里去了
CJ just got in with Linus.

94
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,100
過來
Hey, come here.

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,060
格洛麗亞  她有可能會受傷
She could have been hurt, Gloria.

96
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,440
貝利救了她
Bailey saved her.

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,790
恕我直言
Let me get this straight.

98
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,150
它是電視上的那種英雄狗嗎
It's one of those hero dogs you see on TV?

99
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,130
它叫貝利
Its name is Bailey.

100
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,490
我喜歡聽我的男孩伊森叫我的名字
I love when my boy Ethan says my name.

101
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,700
進屋吧
Go inside.

102
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,040
我知道你做了什么  狗老大
I know what you did, Boss Dog.

103
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,500
走吧
Come on.

104
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,150
我不知道格洛麗亞是從哪找來這個寶寶的
I don't know where Gloria found this baby,

105
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,070
但她是個很棒的新成員
but it is a great addition.

106
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,240
CJ是個聰明  充滿好奇心的孩子
CJ is smart and curious.

107
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,070
我們得照看好她
We just have to keep an eye on her.

108
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,410
我就轉身了兩秒
Well, I turned my back for two seconds.

109
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,020
更像是兩年吧
More like two years.

110
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,350
CJ
CJ.

111
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,520
-吃一口  CJ  -不吃
- Come on, CJ. - No.

112
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,320
-克拉里蒂·瓊  -奶奶  奶奶
- Clarity. Clarity June. - Nana, Nana.

113
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,330
媽媽在這  你能叫聲媽媽嗎
Mama's here now. Can you say "Mama"?

114
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,780
奶奶  奶奶
Nana, Nana.

115
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,360
好吧
All right.

116
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,950
克拉里蒂·瓊  這不好玩
Clarity June, that is not funny.

117
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,410
有點好玩
It's kind of funny.

118
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,210
為什么從來沒有人往我臉上涂吃的
Why doesn't anyone ever wipe food on my face?

119
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,060
經歷了興奮刺激的一天后
After all the excitement of the day,

120
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,260
我得在大水盆里降降溫
I had to cool off in the big water bowl.

121
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,610
你知道那是什么
You know what that is.

122
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,800
玩得開心嗎
You having fun yet?

123
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,220
爺...
Grand...

124
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,200
爺爺  天哪
Grandpa. Oh... oh, my goodness.

125
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,160
我就讓你們帶她幾個小時
I-I leave her with you for a couple hours,

126
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,560
你們就讓克拉里蒂和骯臟的狗一起洗澡
and you have Clarity bathing with a filthy dog?

127
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,730
格洛麗亞終于想和我們一起玩了
Finally, Gloria wants to play.

128
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,500
他們只是在一起玩水
Well, they're just playing.

129
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,960
好了  出去  狗
All right, get-get out. Get out, dog.

130
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,210
拜托
Come on.

131
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,650
他們只是在一起玩
They're just having fun.

132
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,820
這樣吧
You know what?

133
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,860
別擔心  寶貝  媽媽來了
Don't worry, honey. Mommy's here.

134
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,920
好了  沒事的
Come on. It's okay.

135
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,240
我知道你想讓我做什么了
I get what you want me to do.

136
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,580
這就是我不喜歡狗的原因
This is why I don't like dogs.

137
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,380
也許你是想用鼻子拱我屁股吧
Maybe you wanted to stick your nose in my butt?

138
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,970
格洛麗亞年紀輕輕就成了寡婦
Gloria is just so young to be a widow.

139
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,820
亨利出車禍的時候她已經懷胎八月了
Eight months pregnant when Henry was in that car accident.

140
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,640
我知道  親愛的  我知道
I know, honey. I know.

141
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,890
漢娜  但她的母性本能哪去了
But, Hannah, where's her maternal instinct?

142
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,370
格洛麗亞只是想搞清楚
Gloria's just trying to figure out

143
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,080
她和CJ要如何謀生
how she's gonna make a life for herself and CJ.

144
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,160
但她拿到了亨利的保險理賠金
But she's got Henry's insurance settlement.

145
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,570
那筆錢已經存起來留給CJ上大學用了
Well, that money's been set aside for CJ's college fund.

146
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,950
養大兩個孩子的是你  不是我
You're the one that raised two kids, not me.

147
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,260
所以你不擔心的話
So, if you're not worried about it,

148
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,530
我就不擔心
I'm not worried about it.

149
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,040
她們如果不在這里  我就會擔心
I'd be worried if they weren't here.

150
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,510
-是啊  -爽
- Yeah. - Yeah.

151
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,850
往上點  就是這里
Up, up, up. There we go.

152
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,060
沒錯  就在中間
Yeah, right in the middle.

153
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,230
往下滑  往下滑  舒服
Now slide it down. Slide it down. Yeah.

154
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,940
我覺得我們三個可以提供
Between the three of us, I think we can

155
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,050
這個小女孩需要的愛
give that little girl the love that she needs.

156
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,550
疼
Ouch!

157
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,590
-那是什么  -怎么了
- What is that? - What?

158
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,850
是個腫塊
It's a lump.

159
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,560
大腫塊
Big lump.

160
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,160
別再戳我肚子上的那一塊了
Please stop poking that spot on my belly.

161
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,770
我要帶他去看獸醫
I'm gonna take him to the vet.

162
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,790
-好  -怎么回事
- Yeah. - What's going on?

163
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,940
伙計  你好  貝利
Hey, buddy. Hi, Bailey.

164
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,110
不知怎地  伊森總是知道我什么時候想坐車
Somehow, Ethan always knows when I want to take a car ride.

165
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,550
狗老大
Boss Dog.

166
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,800
好好休息  好嗎  伙計
I want you to stay put, okay, buddy?

167
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,770
德布醫生說應該盡量讓你過得舒適
Dr. Deb said we should just keep you comfortable.

168
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,020
我一個人干活就行了
I can handle all the chores.

169
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,390
我經歷過壞日子  也經歷過好日子
I had bad days, and I had good days.

170
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,490
-今天就是個好日子  -我也是
- Today was a good day. - Well, me, too.

171
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,660
我終于接到游輪打來的電話了
Well, I finally got a call from the, um... the cruise line.

172
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,670
格洛麗亞老是對著自己的手說話
Gloria spent a lot of time talking to her hand.

173
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,330
他們的馬車廳需要一位歌手
And they needed a singer for their Stagecoach Lounge.

174
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,280
-狗狗  狗狗  -我知道
- Doggy, doggy, doggy. - I know.

175
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,060
杯子里什么都沒有
There's nothing in that cup.

176
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,590
你有給我倒一杯嗎
Did you make me a cup?

177
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,630
-奶奶  給你  -謝謝
- Here, Nana. - Thank you.

178
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,540
很適合我  不是嗎
Well, it's perfect for me, right?

179
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,390
-好喝  -那么好喝嗎
- Delicious. - That delicious?

180
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,770
等等  杯子里有東西嗎
Wait, there was something in that cup?

181
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,690
是啊  他們選了一個
Yeah, they went with a singer who, uh,

182
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,460
不用帶小孩的歌手
does not have a toddler.

183
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,770
我說不好
I don't know.

184
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,300
也許我該回芝加哥
Maybe I should come back to Chicago.

185
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,220
-還要嗎  -嗯  但我不知道還能做什么
- More? - Yeah, but I don't really know what more I can do.

186
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,690
哄她睡覺太難了
Getting her to go down for her nap took forever.

187
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,480
格洛麗亞  是這樣
You know, Gloria...

188
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,950
如果你想追求自己的事業
if-if you want to pursue your career,

189
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,530
我們可以幫你照顧克拉里蒂
you could leave Clarity here with us.

190
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,950
你覺得我是個壞媽媽嗎
You think I'm a bad mother?

191
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,710
-什么  -格洛麗亞
- What? - Gloria...

192
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,270
不  我不是這個意思
No, that's not what I'm saying.

193
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,310
你想奪走我的孩子嗎
Are you trying to take my-my baby from me?

194
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,500
這個孩子就是我的一切
'Cause my baby is all I have.

195
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,110
格洛麗亞  這是個很好的提議
Gloria, she's making you an incredible offer.

196
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,440
我知道你們為什么要這么做
I know what this is about.

197
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,610
你們想要亨利的理賠金
You want Henry's settlement.

198
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,610
我早就知道你們想要這筆錢
I-I-I knew you wanted that money

199
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,030
這樣你們就可以修這個破農場了
so you can fix this crumbling farm.

200
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,410
這個農場不破
This farm is not crumbling.

201
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,660
伊森很生氣
Ethan was mad.

202
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,830
我很久沒聽過他用這種語氣說話了
I hadn't heard him talk like that in a long time.

203
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,330
這件事和錢無關
It has nothing to do with the money.

204
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,960
是為了給CJ一個溫暖的家
It has to do with providing a loving home for CJ.

205
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,630
漢娜  我是她的媽媽
Well, Hannah, I am her mother.

206
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,860
所以我去哪里  哪里就是她的家
So, wherever I am, that is her home.

207
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,210
而且很明顯  這里不歡迎我
And okay, wow, obviously, I'm not welcome here.

208
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,840
這里永遠歡迎你
You are always welcome here.

209
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,260
這樣你就可以每天告訴我
So you can keep telling me all the things

210
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,550
我又做錯了什么嗎
I'm doing wrong every single day?

211
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,010
不了  謝謝  我現在不需要這些
No, thank you. It's actually not what I need right now.

212
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,890
那CJ呢  她的需要怎么辦呢
Well, what about CJ? What about what she needs?

213
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,770
你想過嗎
Do you ever think about that?

214
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,830
有人想過我需要什么嗎
Does anyone ever think about what I need?!

215
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,260
家庭里出問題了
There was trouble in the pack.

216
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,800
肯定是有人吃了格洛麗亞的食物
Somebody must have eaten Gloria's food.

217
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,800
格洛麗亞  請別走
Gloria, please don't leave.

218
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,310
我們談談  我們可以想辦法
Let's talk about this. We can work it out.

219
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,950
不管要怎么做  拜托  我們可以想辦法
Whatever it takes. Please, we can work this out.

220
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,600
你好像還是不懂  她是我的孩子  不是你的
You don't seem to understand. She's my baby, not yours.

221
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,480
伊森  我們該怎么辦
Ethan, what are we gonna do?

222
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,730
格洛麗亞
Gloria.

223
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,780
格洛麗亞
Gloria.

224
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,420
漢娜如此悲傷
Such sadness from Hannah.

225
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,510
-奶奶  -我愛你
- Nana. - I Love you.

226
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,050
她的孩子不再出現后  她也曾這么悲傷
Sad like she was after her boy stopped coming around.

227
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,910
聽著  我們想給你些錢
Listen, we want you to have some money.

228
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,560
不了  謝謝
No, thanks.

229
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,170
是給CJ的  你就不能收下嗎
It's for CJ. Would you just take it?

230
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,010
安頓好了記得告訴我們
And let us know where you wind up.

231
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,970
你至少該做到這點
It's the least you could do.

232
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,930
格洛麗亞
Gloria.

233
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,230
再見  CJ
Bye-bye, CJ!

234
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,310
愛你
Love you!

235
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,480
我想幫漢娜和伊森去追車  但是
I wanted to chase the car for Hannah and Ethan, but...

236
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,110
但是我真的沒有力氣
but I just didn't have the energy.

237
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,410
我知道
I know.

238
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,920
我想吃東西讓伊森開心
I wanted to eat to make Ethan happy,

239
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,550
但我一點也不餓
but I wasn't hungry anymore.

240
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,550
CJ離開后這里變得非常安靜
It was really quiet after CJ left.

241
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,260
她會跟我們聯系的
She'll get in touch with us.

242
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,650
最終會的
Eventually.

243
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,620
密歇根的天氣有點冷
It's a little cool out there here in Michigan,

244
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,100
今天還是穿暖和點吧
so you might want to dress warm today.

245
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,460

266
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,800
我出來看到他躺在這里
I came out here and found him laying here.

267
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,260
他非常痛苦
He's in a lot of pain.

268
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,010
我想是時候了
I think it's time.

269
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,310
你已經盡你所能了
You've done everything you could for him.

我的好孩子

00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,170

We had such good times together, didn't we?

275
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,210

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,760
可以去找CJ  你覺得呢
you can come back for CJ, you think?

278
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,730
她需要你  就像我以前需要你一樣
She needs you like I needed you.

00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,190
你可以保護她
You can protect her.

280
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,770
你可以讓她開心  就像你讓我開心一樣
And you make her feel happy like you made me feel happy.

281
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,820
我聽不懂這些話語
I didn't understand all the words,

282
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,360
但不知怎地  我明白伊森的意思
but somehow, I knew what Ethan meant.

283
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,120
-準備好了嗎  伊森  -好了
- Are you ready, Ethan? - Yeah.

284
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,020
-好了伙計  來吧  -好了
- All right, champ. Here we go. - Yeah.

285
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,810
-好孩子  -你不會再痛苦了
- Good boy. - You're not gonna hurt anymore.

286
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,880
我以前經歷過這個
I remember this from before.

287
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,550
稍微刺痛一下
A tiny sting...

288
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,860
然后所有痛苦都化為虛無
and then my pain melted away.

289
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,970
好了  狗老大  好了  伙計
Yeah, Boss Dog. Yeah, bud.

290
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,530
誰是狗老大
Who's the Boss Dog, hmm?

291
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,410
你是狗老大嗎
You the Boss Dog?

292
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,080
我愛你  貝利
I love you, Bailey.

293
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,120
貝利  貝利  貝利  貝利  貝利
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

294
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,920
所有痛苦都消失了
All my pain was gone.

295
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,260
我到了一個神奇的地方
I was in this place, and it was wonderful.

296
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,180
伊森給了我新的使命
Ethan gave me a new purpose.

297
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,310
我要保護CJ
I was going to protect CJ.

298
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,100
在找到她之前我絕不會停下
And I would never stop looking until I found her.

299
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,660
我又變成了小狗
I was a puppy again.

300
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,240
有媽媽和兄弟姐妹
I had a mother and brothers and sisters.

301
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,120
為什么媽媽的乳頭永遠少一個呢
Why are there always seven puppies and six nipples?

302
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,830
別擔心  狗媽媽
Don't you worry, mama dog.

303
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,250
你的小寶貝  每一個我都會幫他們找到好家庭
I'm finding good homes for every single one of your cuties.

304
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,900
但是這次總感覺差了點什么
But it felt like something was missing this time.

305
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,800
我看看
Let's see.

306
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,860
我有耳朵  很長的那種
I have ears, pretty long ones.

307
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,260
我有尾巴  我有鼻子
I have a tail. I have a snout.

308
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,890
不知道我有沒有...
I wonder if I have a...

309
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,680
沒有  這次我是女孩
Nope. I'm a girl this time.

310
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,410
又變成小狗我好開心
It was so great being a puppy again.

311
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:22,270
我可以玩呀玩呀玩
I got to play and play and-and play.

312
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,170
還有條老狗  他叫丘吉爾先生
There was an old dog named Mr. Churchill.

313
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,280
他可有意思了
He was a lot of fun.

314
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,490
他們太難管了  對吧  丘吉爾先生
They're a real handful, eh, Mr. Churchill?

315
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,160
一個接一個  人們領走了我的兄弟姐妹
One by one, people took my brothers and sisters away.

316
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,040
最后剩下的是我最喜歡的弟弟
All that was left was my favorite brother.

317
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,960
我叫莫莉  他叫洛奇
I was called Molly, and he was called Rocky.

318
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,220
然后有一天  最糟糕的事情發生了
Then, one day, the worst thing happened.

319
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,510
洛奇也要走了
Rocky was going away.

320
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,220
那我還能跟誰一起玩呢
Who was I gonna play with?

321
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,470
你們兩個在一起看著很配
You look perfect together.

322
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,270
那個女孩
That girl.

323
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,690
那個女孩很特別
There's something about that girl.

324
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,400
我聞到了熟悉的氣味
I smell something familiar.

325
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,240
聞上去像是...
It smells like...

326
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,450
CJ
CJ!

327
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,890
我記得我的使命  CJ就是我的使命
I remember my purpose! CJ is my purpose!

328
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,160
我不能讓她離開
I can't let her get away.

329
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,250
我來了  CJ
I'm coming, CJ!

330
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,500
我不能讓伊森失望
I can't let Ethan down.

331
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,590
必須到CJ身邊去
Got to get to CJ.

332
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,820
我能行
I got this.

333
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,160
我能行  我能行  我能行
I got this. I got this. I got this.

334
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,860
我不行
I don't got this.

335
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,870
你和洛奇這么合拍  我很高興
I'm so happy you and Rocky are a good match.

336
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,270
他已經是我的最好的朋友了
He's already my best friend.

337
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,940
我來了  CJ
I'm coming, CJ!

338
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,190
這棟房子的柵欄太多了
This house has too many fences.

339
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,130
CJ  是我
CJ, it's me!

340
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,490
我來保護你了
I-I'm here to protect you.

341
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,880
瘋狗
Psycho puppy.

342
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,280
CJ長成巨大的寶寶了
CJ was a gigantic baby now.

343
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,960
這條小狗瘋了
This puppy is insane.

344
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,410
這是莫莉
That's Molly.

345
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,750
她和弟弟形影不離
She and her brother are inseparable.

346
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,670
你家能考慮兩條一起收養嗎
Would your family consider adopting both of them?

347
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,960
我來說
I got this.

348
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,990
我還是見好就收吧
Think I better get out of here

349
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,320
免得連一條都養不了
before they change their minds about getting one dog.

350
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,780
鹽  牛奶
Salt, milk.

351
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,770
-漢堡  -那你呢
- Hamburger. - How about you?

352
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,110
你父母會同意讓你養狗嗎
Do you think your parents would let you have a puppy?

353
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,650
我媽媽確實很喜歡狗
My mom does love dogs.

354
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,820
是嗎
She does?

355
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,550
我還是閉嘴吧
I'm gonna stop talking.

356
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,500
我知道該怎么做  我帶莫莉回家
I know what to do. I'll take Molly home,

357
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,460
我媽媽會愛上她  然后她會打給你
my mom will go crazy for her, and then she can call you.

358
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,790
-好吧  -好吧
- Well... - Well...

359
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,660
-噓  -漢娜以前也總是發出"噓"聲
- Shh. - Ah, that's the same "shh" sound Hannah always made.

360
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,370
我一直沒明白是什么意思
I never know what it means.

361
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,690
克拉里蒂  是你嗎
Clarity, is that you?

362
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,410
媽媽
Mom.

363
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,780
那個聲音  是格洛麗亞
That voice. It was Gloria.

364
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,210
你有沒有  你有沒有挪動那個
Did you, um... did you move that box

365
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,950
裝有我的錄音樣帶的箱子
that had my demos in it?

366
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,300
-沒碰過  -我遇到了一個
- Didn't touch it. - So, I met a, um...

367
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,760
一個制作人  他非常想聽聽我的音樂
this, like... a producer that really wants to hear my music.

368
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,160
我得做作業了
Got to do homework!

369
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,390
-你的新家  -好了  CJ
- Your new home. - Okay, CJ,

370
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,770
你沒什么好怕的
you've got nothing to fear.

371
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,270
我來保護你  有貓
I'm here to protect you. Oh, cat!

372
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,760
莫莉  不
Molly, no!

373
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,880
莫莉  莫莉
Molly! Molly!

374
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,890
不  不  不
No, no! No!

375
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,450
-好極了  你也喜歡玩追趕游戲  -不
- Great. You love playing chase, too. - No!

376
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,480
停下
Stop!

377
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,190
別動我的作業
Not my homework!

378
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,040
不  莫莉
No, Molly!

379
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,520
莫莉  不  莫莉
Molly, no. Molly!

380
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,690
不
No!

381
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,530
不  莫莉  不
No, Molly, no!

382
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,860
慢點  莫莉
Slow down, Molly!

383
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,650
拜托  莫莉
Please. Molly.

384
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,050
這下面有好多可以啃的東西
There's so much to chew on under here.

385
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,240
太棒了
Oh, yeah!

386
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,930
真好玩
That was fun.

387
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,290
-下一個游戲是什么  -莫莉
- What's the next game? - Molly.

388
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,380
你是條破壞狗  沒錯
You're Destructo-Dog. Yes, you are.

389
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,460
我喜歡我的新床
I love my new bed.

390
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,710
-你睡在哪  -好了  莫莉
- Where do you sleep? - Here you go, Molly.

391
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,430
希爾達說你基本懂得外出大小便了
Hilda said you were mostly house-trained,

392
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,400
我暫時在這里放條毛巾  以防萬一
so for now, I'll just put a towel down here, just in case.

393
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,930
想尿的時候  誰也攔不住
When you got to go, you got to go.

394
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,770
不  莫莉  不行
No, Molly, no.

395
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,940
CJ  我得跟你談談
CJ, I need to talk to you.

396
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,600
在換衣服
Changing.

397
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,870
人呢  這門怎么鎖上了
Hello? Why's this door locked?

398
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,820
CJ
CJ.

399
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,740
-快點  -稍等
- Come on. - Just a minute.

400
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,960
我沒玩過這個游戲
Yeah, don't know this game.

401
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,360
不過我可以試試
I will give it a try.

402
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,420
剛剛動靜怎么那么大
What's... what is with all this noise?

403
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,160
CJ  這里簡直像是轟炸現場
CJ, it looks like a bomb went off in here.

404
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,390
我在重新整理房間
I've been doing a little rearranging.

405
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,390
臭死了  你不能把窗戶打開嗎
It smells terrible. Will you at least open a window?

406
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,310
我喜歡你這身  是新買的嗎
I love your outfit. Is it new?

407
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,720
你真的很喜歡嗎
Do you love, love, love it?

408
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,940
我今晚要約會
I have a date tonight.

409
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,130
你要出門
You're going out!

410
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,260
他怎么樣  人好嗎
How is he? Is he nice?

411
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,590
CJ  男人一開始看上去都很好
Well, CJ, they always start out nice.

412
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,180
那你今晚能自己解決晚飯嗎
So can you figure out your-your dinner tonight?

413
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,640
又來
Again?

414
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,720
對
Yeah.

415
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,230
我想把你藏起來可能比我想的要難
I think hiding you might be a little more difficult than I thought.

416
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,920
寶貝  準備好了嗎
Hey, babe. You ready?

417
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,170
我們走吧
Let's go.

418
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,280
CJ
CJ?

419
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,490
-準備好了嗎  -我該說什么
- Are you ready? - What do I say?

420
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,520
問一個問題  然后接著打給她
Ask a question and keep calling back.

421
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,320
不準笑  我得進入角色
Don't laugh. I need to get into character.

422
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,800
- CJ去哪了  -祝我好運吧
- Where did CJ go? - Wish me luck.

423
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,330
是你啊  CJ
Oh, hi, CJ.

424
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,390
喂
Hello?

425
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,430
喂  是希爾達嗎
Hello? Is this Hilda?

426
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,230
我是格洛麗亞·米切爾
This is Gloria Mitchell.

427
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,150
你好  我正在等你打電話來
Hello. I've been expecting your call.

428
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,880
太好了  太好了
Wonderful, wonderful.

429
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,650
今天我女兒克拉里蒂把那條可愛的狗帶回家了
My daughter, Clarity, brought home that sweet dog today.

430
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,400
我們簡直太喜歡她了
We just adore her to pieces.

431
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,820
克拉里蒂  親愛的  我正在跟希爾達說
Clarity, honey, I'm telling Hilda

432
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,730
我們有多愛莫莉
how much we love Molly.

433
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,350
你能稍等一下嗎
Can you hold on for a sec?

434
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,080
時間掐的真準  特倫特
Right on time, Trent.

435
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,070
喂  我是特倫特
Hello? This is Trent.

436
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,530
我應該給洛奇喂多少狗糧
How much kibble should I feed Rocky?

437
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,780
半杯  我得掛了
Half a cup. Uh, I got to go.

438
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,950
正如我所說  我們很想把她留下來
As I was saying, we'd love to be her forever home.

439
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,250
你能稍等一下嗎
Can you hold on for a sec?

440
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,430
干得漂亮  特倫特
Good work, Trent.

441
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,390
量杯是美制還是英制的
Is that half a cup U.S. or half a cup imperial?

442
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,020
半杯就行
It's just half a cup.

443
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,270
或許我應該以重量計算
Maybe I should do it by weight.

444
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,840
你想怎么算就怎么算
Y-You can do it however you want.

445
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,050
我得掛了
I got to go.

446
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,820
-不好意思  總是打斷...  -而現在
- I'm sorry for all of these... - And right now,

447
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,190
我正望著我們巨大的
I'm looking out at our ginormously huge,

448
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,410
后院草坪  莫莉和克拉里蒂
grassy backyard, and Molly and Clarity

449
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,490
正在上面打滾
are rolling all around.

450
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,600
我的天  抱歉稍等一下
Oh, dear. Um, can you excuse me?

451
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,830
我忘記告訴你了
I forgot to tell you,

452
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,290
我給洛奇取了個中間名
I gave Rocky a middle name.

453
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,870
我現在真的很忙
I'm really busy at the moment.

454
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,210
克里夫  懂嗎
Cliff. Get it?

455
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,330
洛奇·克里夫[懸崖峭壁]  挺有趣吧
Rocky Cliff. Pretty funny, right?

456
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,790
我之后再打給你好嗎
Can I call you later about this?

457
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,880
別太晚  因為我明天還得上學
Don't call me too late, because I have school tomorrow

458
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,360
要早點上床睡覺
and I need to go to bed early.

459
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,470
聽起來一切都非常棒
Sounds like a wonderful situation.

460
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,640
我很開心你們相處融洽
I'm so glad it worked out.

461
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,500
那我就不打擾你了  謝謝你
Well, then I'll leave you alone, and thank you.

462
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,980
-怎么樣  -我們成功了
- Well? - We did it!

463
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,110
太刺激了
That was amazing.

464
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,610
我以前從沒做過壞事
I've never done anything bad before.

465
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,390
謝謝  謝謝  謝謝
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

466
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,470
我也會大叫
I can make noise, too!

467
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,030
來吧  快  洛奇
Let's go. Come on, Rocky.

468
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,740
擊掌
High five.

469
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,980
我愛你  狗狗
I love you, girl.

470
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,310
我們成功了
We did it!

471
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,810
我知道自己的使命是保護CJ
I knew my purpose was to protect CJ,

472
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,230
但既然她安然無恙
but since she was safe,

473
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,130
我覺得和洛奇玩耍也是可以的
I thought it was okay to play with Rocky.

474
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,570
洛奇咬爛了家里所有的拖鞋
Rocky destroyed all the slippers in the house.

475
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,970
我爸爸一直在用普通話罵人
My dad's doing a lot of swearing in Mandarin.

476
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,320
我昨晚帶莫莉出去了兩次
I had to take Molly out twice last night.

477
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
她還是在我床上尿尿了
She still peed on my bed.

478
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,450
我簡直不敢相信你設法藏了一條小瘋狗
I can't believe you managed to hide a crazy puppy

479
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,140
哪怕只藏了一天
for even one day.

480
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,820
我們應該一起訓練他們
We should train them together.

481
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,400
你們要去小狗學校了
You guys are going to puppy school.

482
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,420
-洛奇  別這樣  -不  莫莉  不
- Rocky, come on! - No! No, Molly, no!

483
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,680
他們怎么走得這么慢
Why are they walking so slow?

484
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,040
洛奇  慢點
Rocky, slow down!

485
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,160
坐下  坐下
Sit. Sit.

486
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,160
坐下
Sit.

487
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,180
好吧  那你站著吧
Okay, then stand.

488
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,690
乖狗狗
Good dog.

489
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,350
不  你必須得有權威
No, you have to be the authority.

490
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,350
看我的  學著點
Watch and learn.

491
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,730
趴下  趴下
Lie down. Lie down.

492
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,090
-趴下  -我等你想個更好玩的游戲
- Lie down. - I'll wait till you come up with a better game.

493
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,720
看到了嗎  乖狗狗
You see? Good girl.

494
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,850
別動  等著
Stay. Wait.

495
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,660
等等  不  洛奇  站住  洛奇
Wait. No, Rocky. Stop! Rocky!

496
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,370
握爪  握爪  來吧  狗狗
Paw. Paw. Come on, girl.

497
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,160
來吧  狗狗
Let's go, girl.

498
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,400
-什么是握爪  -握爪  來吧  握爪
- What is a paw? - Paw. Come on. Paw. Come on.

499
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,420
-來吧  -也許是這樣
- Let's go. - Maybe this is a paw?

500
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,630
乖狗狗  乖  乖狗狗
Good girl. Good, good girl!

501
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,470
我會握爪了  我會握爪了
I can do paw! I-I-I can do paw!

502
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,950
我同意  你順利從小狗學校畢業了
It's a deal. You have graduated puppy school right now.

503
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,260
-洛奇  回來  -真棒  乖狗狗
- Rocky, come back! - Good, good girl.

504
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,000
-洛奇  洛奇  -乖狗狗
- Rocky! Rocky! - Good girl.

505
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,640
我在學校的時候  你可以待在這里
You can stay here while I'm at school.

506
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,770
不許叫  好嗎
No barking, okay?

507
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,350
不是很明白現在是什么情況
Don't really understand what's happening.

508
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,980
等不及把這個給CJ看了
Can't wait to show this to CJ.

509
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,960
這是吃的嗎
Is that supposed to be food?

510
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,780
如果我不是真空上陣...
Maybe if I wasn't going commando...

511
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,890
什么聞起來這么香
Where'd that great smell come from?

512
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,290
我好喜歡
I love it.

513
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,330
CJ
CJ?

514
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,960
克拉里蒂  你聽到了嗎
Clarity, did you hear that?

515
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,590
我覺得是地下室傳來的  我去看看
I think it came from the basement. I'll check.

516
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,970
我在這兒  CJ
I, uh... I'm here, CJ!

517
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,380
你還記得
You-you remembered!

518
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,350
莫莉  噓
Molly, shh.

519
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,230
又是"噓"  "噓"是什么意思
Again with the "shh." What does "shh" mean?

520
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,690
媽媽  什么都沒有  我覺得是隔壁傳來的
Nothing here, Mom. I think it was next door.

521
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,460
揉肚肚  好不好
Belly rub, please.

522
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,740
我得告訴她你的事  莫莉
Gonna have to tell her about you, Molly.

523
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,910
媽媽  有件事我想向你交代
Mom, there's something I want to tell you.

524
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,040
如果你晚餐想訂披薩的話
So if you, uh, order a pizza for dinner,

525
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,220
不要全吃光  好嗎
do not eat the whole thing, okay?

526
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,370
生活對胖子很不友好
Life is harder when you're chubby.

527
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,140
更何況你說自己想當歌手
Plus, you claim you want to be a singer.

528
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,250
歌手必須漂亮
Got to look good.

529
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,170
感覺CJ像是被擊中了
It felt like CJ got hit,

530
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,010
但我沒看到是什么擊中了她
but I didn't see what hit her.

531
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,630
你想向我交代什么
What'd you want to tell me?

532
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,760
只是想知道你幾點能回家
Just wanted to know what time you'll be home.

533
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,310
不會太晚
Not too late.

534
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,940
媽媽
Mommy!

535
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,170
媽媽  我害怕
Mommy, I'm scared!

536
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,690
等等我  CJ
Wait for me, CJ!

537
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,400
CJ害怕了
CJ was afraid.

538
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,910
我也害怕了
I was afraid.

539
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,740
如果我保護她  也許她也會保護我
Maybe if I protect her, she'll protect me.

540
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,960
我以前很討厭媽媽很晚都不回家
I used to hate it when my mom stayed out late.

541
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,130
現在我有了你
And now I have you.

542
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,300
我再也不用害怕了
I don't have to be scared anymore.

543
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,970
我知道你會保護我
I know you'll protect me.

544
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,680
快讓那個聲音停下
Make that noise stop.

545
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,890
我真的真的很害怕
I'm really, really scared.

546
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,030
咚咚咚
Knock, knock.

547
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,740
早上好  親愛的
Hey, morning, sweetie.

548
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,160
早上好
Good morning.

549
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,880
我覺得給你做點早餐
So I thought it might be nice

550
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,630
應該很不錯
if I cooked you some breakfast.

551
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,370
什么  你會做早餐嗎
What? Do you even know how to do that?

552
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,180
傻孩子  我當然會
You silly. Of course I do.

553
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,430
我要出去  我憋不住了
I need to get outside. I need to go.

554
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,210
那...那是什么
Wh-What... what is that?

555
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,210
這是...這是...
This is, um... this is...

556
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,670
你一定就是克拉里蒂  我是保羅
You must be Clarity. I'm Paul.

557
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,930
這個小伙子是誰啊
And who's that little fella?

558
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,140
是小姑娘
Little gal.

559
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,910
-她叫莫莉  -我們要起床了嗎
- Her name's Molly. - Are we getting up?

560
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,280
說真的  我憋不住了
I seriously need to go.

561
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,350
太可愛了吧
What a sweetie.

562
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,990
-我喜歡狗  -是嗎
- I love dogs. - Oh, yeah?

563
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,600
我和媽媽也喜歡
Me and my mom do, too.

564
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,790
我得出去遛莫莉了
I have to take Molly out for a walk,

565
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,440
不過我們會回來吃早餐的
but we'll be back for breakfast.

566
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,520
好的
Okay.

567
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,030
-我先去準備雞尾酒  -好極了
- I'll go start those mimosas. - Great.

568
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,460
我們惹上麻煩了  莫莉  是的  大麻煩
We're in trouble, Molly. Yes, we are.

569
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,720
你背著我養了一條狗
You went behind my back and you got a dog?

570
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,890
你不許養狗
You're not allowed to have a dog.

571
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,790
聽明白了嗎
You understand me?

572
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,410
格洛麗亞聽起來很生氣
Gloria sounded angry.

573
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,290
氣味也很濃重
Smelled pretty strong, too.

574
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,170
寶貝  要再來一杯雞尾酒嗎
Hey, babe, you want another mimosa?

575
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,030
好啊  太好了
Oh, yeah, that'd be lovely.

576
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,070
我要留下她
I'm keeping her.

577
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,050
如果她會玩耍  也許就會開心一點
Maybe if she plays, she will feel happy.

578
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,420
我要留下莫莉
I'm keeping Molly.

579
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,470
我是你媽媽  我說了算
I am your mother, and I am the boss.

580
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,600
媽媽不應該讓十一歲的女兒夜里一人在家
And you're not supposed to leave your 11-year-old alone at night,

581
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,010
幾乎每晚都是
almost every night,

582
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,290
還是在嚇人的雷雨夜
during terrifying thunderstorms.

583
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,940
我的老師肯定很有興趣
I'm sure my teacher would be very interested

584
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,810
了解這樣的媽媽
in a mother who did that.

585
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,380
你是在威脅我嗎
Are you threatening me?

586
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,090
我會害怕
I get scared.

587
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,100
莫莉會保護我
Molly protects me.

588
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,060
你不能逼我送走她
You can't make me get rid of her.

589
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,640
懂了嗎
See?

590
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,930
她是我最好的朋友
She's my best friend.

591
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,190
我愿意為她做任何事
And I'll do everything for her.

592
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,190
你甚至都沒發現她在家
You didn't even know she was here.

593
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,780
這狗需要洗澡
That dog needs a bath.

594
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,010
你可以留下來了  你可以和我在一起了
You're staying with me. You get to stay with me.

595
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,390
好孩子  CJ  你是個好孩子
Good girl, CJ. You're a good girl.

596
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,700
沒錯  你的確需要洗澡
Yep, you do need a bath.

597
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,180
的確需要
Yep. You do.

598
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,210
看  莫莉  我的吊墜手鏈
Look, Molly, my charm bracelet.

599
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,600
上面有全世界我最愛的兩樣東西
It has my two favorite things in the whole world:

600
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,100
你和我的吉他
you and my guitar.

601
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,460
謝謝你給我看  雖然我不知道那是什么
Thank you for showing me whatever that is.

602
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,550
我要接著睡覺了
I will be going back to sleep now.

603
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,340
? 我都會 ?
♪ I'll be here ♪

604
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,550
? 陪著你 ?
♪ With you ♪

605
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,060
? 親近或遙遠 ?
♪ Near or far ♪

606
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,140
? 結束或開始 ?
♪ The end or the start... ♪

607
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,150
特倫特一如既往  總是很準時
Good old Trent, always on time.

608
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,030
洛奇一如既往  總是很準時
Good old Rocky, always on time.

609
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,260
首先  我來拉這根棍子
First, I'm gonna pull the stick,

610
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,950
然后你拉  然后我再拉
then you pull the stick, then I'll pull the stick.

611
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,240
看看我們的小狗
Look at our babies.

612
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,750
是啊  都長大了
Yep. All grown-up.

613
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,750
我們是不是該開始為上大學存錢了
Should we start saving for college?

614
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,420
莫莉和我并不是上大學的料  特倫特
Molly and I aren't exactly on the college track, Trent.

615
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,640
實際上我正在考慮退學
I'm actually thinking about dropping out of school.

616
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,590
要是我跟父母說要從高中退學
If I told my parents I was dropping out of high school,

617
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,870
他們會直接自燃
they would spontaneously combust.

618
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,870
好吧  我要盡快離開這里
Yeah, well, as soon as I can, I'm getting out of here.

619
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,220
我打算搬去紐約
I'm gonna move to New York City.

620
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,740
你打算怎么實現
And how are you gonna do that?

621
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,760
我爸死后有一筆保險理賠金
There was this insurance settlement when my dad died.

622
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,040
我滿十八了  終于能領這筆錢了
I finally get the money when I'm 18, so...

623
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,310
我準備用這筆錢搬去紐約
I'm gonna use it to move to New York,

624
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,690
錄樣帶  開始我的音樂人生涯
make a demo and get my career started as a musician.

625
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,340
你沒怎么提起過你爸爸
You hardly ever talk about your dad.

626
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,170
CJ需要我時  我就能感覺到
I-I can tell when CJ needs me.

627
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,820
等一下  洛奇  我去去就回
Hold on, Rocky. I'll be right back.

628
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,250
莫莉
Hey, Molly.

629
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,100
想坐下嗎  來吧
Want to sit? Come on.

630
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,850
那個...
Yeah, well...

631
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,720
我爸在我還沒出生時就去世了  所以...
died right before I was born, so...

632
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,870
我根本不了解他
I don't really know anything about him.

633
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,380
除了格洛麗亞說我小時候
Well, except Gloria said his parents tried to steal

634
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,500
他父母想偷走這筆錢
that money from me when I was a baby.

635
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,050
我也不知道
So... I don't know.

636
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,380
或許她半數時間都是醉醺醺的  但是...
Maybe she's drunk half the time, but...

637
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,600
她也算對我做了一件好事
she did do one good thing for me.

638
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,870
有時候CJ抱我抱得太緊
Sometimes CJ squeezed me so tight,

639
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,030
我都快喘不上氣了
I could barely breathe.

640
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,580
不過我喜歡
I loved it.

641
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,060
你想買東西嗎
Are you gonna buy something?

642
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,820
如果是的話  我就得再進去一趟
'Cause if you are, I got to go back in.

643
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,380
是的吧
Guess I was.

644
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,060
不過我不急
I'm not, like, in a hurry or anything, though.

645
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,890
我來猜猜
Let me guess.

646
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,530
一袋椒鹽卷餅和一瓶雪碧
A bag of pretzels and a Sprite.

647
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,610
是的  我可能特別好猜吧
Okay, I guess I'm pretty predictable.

648
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,500
我叫沙恩
Shane.

649
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,770
我叫CJ
CJ.

650
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,300
這是莫莉
That's Molly.

651
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,170
我對這個人有種不好的預感
I'm getting a bad feeling about this person.

652
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,370
它在做什么
What's it doing?

653
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,120
準備在我身上尿尿嗎
Getting ready to pee on me?

654
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,090
別激動  莫莉
Cool it, Molly.

655
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,270
抱歉
Sorry.

656
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,080
-你喜歡機車嗎  -算是吧
- So, you like motorcycles? - Kind of.

657
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,930
-是嗎  -別激動  莫莉
- Yeah? - Cool it, Molly.

658
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,490
你應該把球扔出去
You're supposed to throw the ball.

659
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,380
撿起球  再丟出去
You pick it up and throw it.

660
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,770
然后我把球撿回給你  你再扔出去
And then I get it and you throw it again.

661
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,430
不了  謝謝  狗狗
No, thanks, doggy.

662
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,100
他不明白
He doesn't understand.

663
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,760
他不怎么機靈
He's not too smart.

664
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,950
你想要這個嗎  莫莉
You want this, Molly?

665
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,120
你想玩撿球嗎
You want to go get it?

666
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,540
去撿吧
Go get it.

667
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,660
洛奇  特倫特
Rocky! Trent!

668
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,470
快速聞聞洛奇的屁屁
A quick sniff of Rocky's butt

669
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,020
我就知道洛奇一切安好
told me everything was going great for Rocky.

670
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,440
來吧  我們走
Come on, let's go.

671
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,550
特倫特
Hey, Trent.

672
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,780
-謝謝  -沒事
- Thanks. - Yeah.

673
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,710
這是沙恩
This is Shane.

674
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,690
他們都想加入CJ的家庭
Both of them want to be in CJ's pack.

675
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,810
你怎么了  怎么沒回我電話
What's up? Uh, you didn't return my call.

676
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,040
對了  抱歉  我有點忙
Oh, right. Sorry. I've... been kind of busy.

677
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,570
這是誰  你老媽嗎
Who is this, your mother?

678
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,090
雖然表面上他們沒有互相咆哮
They weren't growling at each other on the outside,

679
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,030
但我還是聽得見
but they were still growling.

680
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,980
你看看
Check it out.

681
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,990
下周有場選秀
Talent show, next week.

682
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,210
你有機會
This is a chance for you

683
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,480
真正在聽眾面前表演了
to actually perform in front of an audience.

684
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,500
我想你一定會很出色的
I bet you'd be great.

685
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,620
得了吧  你多少年沒聽過我唱歌了
Come on. You haven't heard me sing in years.

686
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,630
我知道  但你總有一天要在人們面前演出
I know, but you have to perform in front of people someday.

687
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,380
再說了  勝者有五百塊獎金
Plus, the winner gets $500.

688
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,670
去參加吧  CJ  你可以在
Yeah, do it, CJ. I mean, you can sing a song

689
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,620
魔術表演和啞劇之間唱首歌
between the magician and the mime.

690
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,250
確實有點遜  特倫特
Does look kind of lame, Trent.

691
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,210
不過還是謝謝你
Thanks, though.

692

762
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,210
到高速邊撿垃圾嗎
picking up trash on the side of the highway?

763
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,600
不是  我被分配到了一個
No, actually, I got assigned to this program

764
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,430
訓練狗聞出癌癥的項目
that trains dogs to sniff cancer.

765
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,140
-癌癥  -是的
- Cancer? - Yeah.

766
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,920
聽起來很不靠譜  但是...
Sounds pretty wacky, but...

767
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,800
至少我可以帶著莫莉一起

{\an8}德斯普蘭斯機構
先進醫療培訓及技術

769

So, we're a pilot program, which is very exciting

770
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,440
因為我們取得了不少驚人的成果
because we've been getting amazing results.

771
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,870
等等  你是說
Wait, so you're telling me

772
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,910
這些狗能比醫生更早發現癌癥患者
these dogs know people have cancer before doctors do?

773
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,790
人類是眼觀世界  狗則是用鼻子聞
We see the world. Dogs smell it.

774
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,000
他們的嗅覺比人類要靈敏十萬倍
Their sense of smell is 100,000 times as acute as ours.

775
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,050
所以我們嘗試訓練狗  讓他們能夠
So, we're working on trying to get the dogs to recognize

776
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,130
辨別癌癥樣本和良性樣本
the difference between cancer samples and benign samples.

777
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,050
如果能成功訓練狗的嗅覺
If we successfully scent-train a dog,

778
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,870
就能改變一些人的生死
it can make the difference between life and death.

779
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,290
等等  我可以為狗進行嗅覺訓練嗎
Wait, so I get to scent-train a dog?

780
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,560
太酷了
That's so cool.

781
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,880
我喜歡你的熱情  但首先...
I love the enthusiasm, but first...

782
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,550
但愿CJ的使命不是這個
I hope this isn't CJ's purpose.

783
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,790
我們每天都去
We went every day.

784
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,650
CJ很開心  這也讓我很開心
CJ was happy, and that made me happy.

785
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,130
為什么他有吃的
Why is he getting treats?

786
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,740
我也想要吃的
I want treats, too.

787
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,760
-乖狗狗  波迪  -好吧
- Good dog, Bode. - Okay.

788
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:24,180
如果波迪再得到吃的
If Bode gets one more treat

789
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,230
我還是什么都沒有的話
and I get nothing,

790
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,800
我就要發飆了
I'm gonna go nuts.

791
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,840
好孩子  好孩子  波迪
Good boy. Good boy, Bode.

792

這個氣味
That smell.

793
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,240
波迪就是因為這個得到吃的的嗎
Is that why Bode gets treats?

794
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,520
如果我也...
Maybe if I...

795
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,900
-你看到了嗎  -嗯
- Did you see that? - Yeah.

796
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,030
好孩子
Good girl.

797
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:54,840
就是這樣
That's it.

798
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,790
如果你聞到了這個氣味  就會得吃的
If you smell the smell, you get a treat.

799
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,960
CJ  你介意我也開始訓練莫莉嗎
CJ, do you mind if I start training Molly, too?

800
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,630

00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,400
你認不出我了嗎
Can't you tell it's me?

831
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,340
是你嗎  狗老大
Is that you, Boss Dog?

832
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,590
是我  是我  是我
It's me, it's me, it's me!

833
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:18,660
別叫了
Quiet!

834
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,930
格洛麗亞  我們只想見CJ
Gloria, we just want to see CJ.

835
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,930
你們憑什么覺得自己可以說來就來
What makes you think you can just show up like this?

836
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,890
我已經不是小孩子了
Okay, I-I-I'm not a little kid anymore,

837
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,350
不會再任你們擺布
so you can't... you can't push me around.

838
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,890
我們只想見我們的孫女
We want to see our granddaughter,

839

看看她過得怎么樣

840
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,270
我去告訴CJ你們來了
I'll go tell CJ you're here.

841
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:37,010
她不想見你們
Well, she doesn't want to see you.

842
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:39,900
-她在家嗎  -不關你們的事
- Is she home? - That is none of your business!

843
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,240
說了你都不信
You're not gonna believe it.

844
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,950
伊森和漢娜來了
Ethan and Hannah are here,

845
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,490
他們的氣味比以前更好聞了
and they smell better than ever.

846
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,660
-來  快來  -你在干什么
- Come! Come now! - Hey. What you doing?

847

走吧  跟我走

離開你們  我們過得很好
We have a whole life without you.

849
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:52,820
-我很不喜歡這種伏擊  -"伏擊"
- I really don't appreciate this ambush. - "Ambush"?

850
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,290
格洛麗亞  我們是一家人
Gloria, we're family.

851
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,200
格洛麗亞
Gloria.

852
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,040
我們能從頭再來嗎  拜托
Can't we just start again? Please.

853
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,880
-讓我們重新開始  -格洛...

格洛麗亞  格洛麗亞  拜托
Gloria, Gloria, please.

855
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,470
你不記得伊森和漢娜了
Y-You forgot Ethan and Hannah.

856
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,760
別這么看我
Don't look at me like that.

857
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,640
這么多年過去了
All these years later,

858
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,380
他們還想把她從我身邊奪走
they still want to take her from me.

859
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:16,430
格洛麗亞
Gloria!

860
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,050
讓他們進來  是伊森和漢娜
L-Let them in. It's Ethan and Hannah.

861
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,810
我把它放在這兒
I'll just leave it here.

862
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,530
我知道是你  狗老大
I know that's you, Boss Dog.

863
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,120
我喜歡聽他叫我"狗老大"
I love it when he calls me "Boss Dog."

864
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,150
繼續照顧CJ
You just keep looking after CJ.

865
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:35,570
好
Okay.

866
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:42,960
不  別走
No, don't leave!

867
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,700
CJ在這兒
CJ's here.

868
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,540
來  莫莉  來
Come on, Molly. Come on.

869
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,380
好了
Okay.

870
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:55,840
干得好  莫莉
Good job, Molly.

871
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,310
安迪說你的嗅覺訓練進行得很順利
Andi says you've really taken to scent training.

872
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,800
給點吃的  拜托
Food, please.

873
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,930
離我們遠點
Leave us alone.

874
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:04,610
你來這里干什么
What are you doing here?

875
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:05,820
你不接我電話
You don't answer my calls.

876
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,450
因為我不想跟你說話  沙恩
Yeah, because I don't want to talk to you, Shane.

877
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:08,390
別這樣  CJ
Come on, CJ.

878
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,270
你不會還在因為派對的事生我的氣吧
You're not still mad about the party?

879
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,740
別不搭理我
Don't walk away from me.

880
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,650
放手  沙恩
Get off. Shane!

881
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,170
你干什么
What are you doing?

882
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:16,110
-我以為你沒這么慫呢  -沙恩
- I thought you were cooler than this. - Shane!

883
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,240
它咬我
It bit me!

884
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:20,750
滾開  CJ不喜歡你
Go away. CJ doesn't like you.

885
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,410
我要宰了那條蠢狗
I'm gonna kill that stupid dog!

886
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:25,990
我也不喜歡你
I don't like you, either.

887
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:31,430
理查德  如果是你
Richard, if that's you,

888
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,630
正好來把你的垃圾拿走
why don't you come get your junk?

889
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,670
是你啊
It's you.

890
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,470
理查德走了
Richard left.

891
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,340
沙恩剛剛襲擊了我
Shane just attacked me.

892
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,080
格洛麗亞的氣味比以往更濃重
Gloria smelled stronger than usual.

893
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:58,280
看來今天我們跟男人處得都不順利
Well... looks like today's not a good day for us and men.

894
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,860
是啊
Right.

895
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:03,950
你喝醉了
You're drunk.

896
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,960
對啊
Yeah.

897
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:11,680
成年人可以喝醉
Adults are allowed to get drunk

898
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,170
尤其是在被借到錢后
when they get dumped by their boyfriend

899
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,930
就再也不出現的男友甩了以后
who borrowed money they will never see again.

900
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,800
我說有人襲擊了我  媽媽
I just told you that some guy attacked me, Mom.

901
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:21,850
真的很可怕  你一點都不關心嗎
It was really scary. Do you even care?

902
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,360
你做了什么  你勾引他了嗎
Well, what did you do? Did you... did you lead him on?

903
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,760
你激怒他了嗎
Did you provoke him or something?

904
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,730
真不敢相信你居然這么說
I cannot believe you just said that.

905
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,870
你真的是世界上最惡劣的媽媽
You are literally the worst mother in the world.

906
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:40,690
不  最惡劣的是我媽媽
No, that was my mother.

907
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,990
我要走了
I'm leaving.

908
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,040
我不想再待在這里
I don't want to be here anymore.

909
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,170
我要帶上我的錢  然后搬出去
I'm taking my money, and I'm moving out.

910
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,600
-什么錢  -我爸爸的理賠金
- What money? - The money from Dad's settlement.

911
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,880
克拉里蒂  那筆錢已經沒了
Clarity, that money's gone.

912
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:00,550
什么
What?

913
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,260
你以為我們的房子是怎么來的
How do you think we have a house?

914
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,050
還有車
And a car?

915
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,950
但那筆錢是留給我的
But... but that money was for me.

916
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:14,030
你已經在用了  CJ
Well, it's been for you, CJ!

917
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,580
我孤身一人
I am alone.

918
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,440
-你怎么能指望我獨自承擔這一切  -等等
- How do you expect me to do... to do this on my own? - W-Wait.

919
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,360
所以那些...
So, all of the...

920
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:25,380
那些旅行  媽媽
all of the travel, Mom,

921
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,960
那些裝滿衣櫥的名牌衣服
the-the closet full of designer clothes,

922
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,290
一箱箱的葡萄酒...
the cases of wine...

923
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,500
花的都是我的財產
that... that's all been my inheritance?

924
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,250
我也值得擁有好東西
I deserve nice things, too.

925
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:45,980
媽媽  那筆錢是爸爸
Mom, that money was the only thing

926
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,090
唯一留給我的東西
I ever got from my dad.

927
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,350
那是唯一讓我覺得
That was the only thing that made me feel like,

928
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,830
也許這個世界上還有人
somewhere in the world, there might actually be

929
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,770
關心我的東西
someone looking out for me.

930
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:04,500
看來是我太傻了  對吧
But I guess that was really stupid, wasn't it?

931
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,040
你不能把車開走
You cannot take the car.

932
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,070
為什么不能  我付的錢
Why not? I paid for it.

933
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,730
我從來不知道
I never knew there could be

934
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:27,340
還有傷心兜風這回事
such a thing as a sad car ride.

935
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:33,850
什么
What?

936
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,940
沙恩
Shane?

937
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,270
別來煩我
Leave me alone.

938
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,170
你在干什么
What are you doing?

939
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,520
我只想坐在座位上
All I wanted to do was stay

940
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,520
但車一直把我甩來甩去
on my seat, but the car kept pushing me off.

941
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,760
抱歉  莫莉
Sorry, Molly.

942
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,140
天啊
Oh, God.

943
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,770
什么
What?

944
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:23,360
這輛車瘋了
The car's gone crazy.

945
00:50:58,410 --> 00:50:59,350
莫莉
Molly?

946
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,560
車總算停了
The car finally stopped.

947
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,740
你沒事吧  CJ
Are you okay, CJ?

948
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,570
莫莉  莫莉
Molly? Molly?

949
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,490
我喜歡這聲音
I love that sound.

950
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,760
說明CJ在旁邊
It means CJ's nearby.

951
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,370
莫莉  莫莉
Molly. Molly?

952
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:22,920
莫莉
Molly?

953
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,340
但我知道我要離開她了
But now I know I'm leaving her.

954
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,430
-我也不想  -莫莉
- I don't want to. - Molly.

955
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,060
但我別無選擇
But I have no choice.

956
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,300
莫莉
Molly.

957
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,090
莫莉
Molly.

958
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,980
-不  莫莉  -我記得農場里的小CJ
- No, Molly. - I remembered baby CJ on the farm

959
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:40,100
記得我多么想保護她
and how much I wanted to protect her.

960
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:43,350
記得她多么需要我
How much she needed me.

961
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,560
她的旅程...
Her journey...

962
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,610
還沒結束
is not over.

963
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,700
快來
Come on.

964
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,670
CJ很難過
CJ was so sad.

965
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,130
她還需要我
She still needs me.

966
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:11,970
CJ  不管你在哪  我發誓...
CJ, wherever you are, I promise...

967
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,050
我都會找到你
I'll find you.

968
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:22,780
但首先  我得處理些事情
But first, I need to get a few things out of the way.

969
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,940
我得玩耍  我得摔跤
I need to play. I need to wrestle.

970
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,830
我得啃臉
I need to bite a few faces.

971
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:27,700
我得吠叫
I need to bark.

972
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,080
我得玩毛毯
I need to play with a blanket.

973
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,900
我得咬耳朵
I need to bite some ears.

974
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,280
很不幸  我還是得洗澡
And, unfortunately, I still have to take baths.

975
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,960
我知道我的旅程應該和CJ在一起  但是...
I knew my journey was with CJ, but...

976
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,210
我到處都找不到她的氣味
I couldn't find her scent anywhere.

977
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:56,230
{\an8}喬的便利店

978
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,960
過來  大狗
Come on, Big Dog.

979
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,440
現在我和喬一起生活
Now I lived with Joe.

980
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,630
-準備好迎接新的一天了嗎  -他對我很好
- Ready for another day? - He was good to me.

981
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,070
他住在一棟用零食做成的房子里
He lived in a house made out of snacks.

982
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:01,180
給你的
Just for you.

983
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,640
好好享用
Okay, bon appétit.

984
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:09,520
這是我的最愛
These are my favorite.

985
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:15,500
-慢慢享用  -我忘了這個
- Enjoy it. - I forgot about these.

986
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,280
不  這才是我的最愛
No, these are definitely my favorite.

987
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,410
你不能吃冰淇淋
No ice cream for you.

988
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,380
牛肉干怎么樣
How about a Slim Jim?

989
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,510
就是它
That's the one.

990
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,470
冠軍出現了
We have a winner.

991
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,830
我的最愛
My favorite.

992
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:36,800
后來有一天
Then, one day,

993
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,470
我聽到了讓我想起...
I heard something that reminded me of...

994
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:47,270
那個聲音
That sound.

995
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,030
早上好
Morning.

996
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,860
你好
Hi.

997
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,570
會是她嗎
Could it be?

998
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,870
再讓我聞一聞  確認一下
Maybe one more sniff, just to be sure.

999
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,210
今天過得怎么樣
How's your day going?

1000
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,600
挺好的  謝謝
Pretty good, thanks.

1001
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,930
一共四塊五
That'll be $4.50.

1002
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:12,140
真不敢相信
I don't believe it.

1003
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,850
是我的CJ  我找到你了
It's my CJ. I found you!

1004
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,590
大狗
Big Dog.

1005
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:18,150
他從來不為任何事起身
He never gets up for anything.

1006
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:21,010
"大狗"  你怎么想到這個名字的
"Big Dog"? How'd you ever come up with that name?

1007
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,900
靈光一現
Just sort of came to me.

1008
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,240
你好  大狗
Hey there, Big Dog. Hey.

1009
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,280
-現在我可以跟你走了  -你好嗎
- Now I can go with you. - How you doing?

1010
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,280
我們去哪兒
Where are we going?

1011
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,690
他肯定聞到你身上的狗味了
Must smell a dog on you.

1012
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:31,490
我沒有養狗
I don't have a dog.

1013
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,740
以前養過
Used to, though.

1014
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,720
她叫莫莉  她是最棒的
Her name was Molly. She was the best.

1015
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,950
她知道是我  我們終于重逢了
She knows it's me. We're finally back together.

1016
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,000
握爪
Paw.

1017
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,920
太可愛了
That is so sweet.

1018
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,760
我教過我的狗握爪
I, um... I trained my dog to shake.

1019
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,590
他從來沒做過
He's never done that before.

1020
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,420
真的嗎
Really?

1021
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:55,340
很高興認識你  大狗
Well, it's very nice to meet you, Big Dog.

1022
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,970
我還要一張彩票刮刮卡
Can I also get a lottery scratch card?

1023
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,300
你要去哪兒
So, where you headed?

1024
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,480
紐約
New York City.

1025
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,050
我希望喬告訴她我有多愛牛肉干
I hope Joe tells her about how much I love meat sticks.

1026
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,720
搬去紐約工作還是...
You got a job or something?

1027
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,930
我是一名唱作人
Well, I'm a singer-songwriter.

1028
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,150
想成為一名唱作人  所以...
Trying to be a singer-songwriter, so...

1029
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,110
不會吧  五十塊
Oh, no way. 50 bucks.

1030
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,900
恭喜你
Congratulations.

1031
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,320
這輩子從來沒中過獎
Never won anything before in my life.

1032
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:20,710
你肯定是條幸運狗
You must be a lucky dog.

1033
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:21,710
我還希望喬告訴她
And I hope Joe tells her about

1034
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,500
那種嘎吱嘎吱的咸東西  太好吃了
the crunchy, salty things, too. Oh, they're so good.

1035
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,580
謝謝
Thank you.

1036
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,330
好了  再見
Okay. See ya.

1037
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:31,050
-一路平安  -真希望我能感謝喬
- Travel safe. - I wished I could thank Joe for taking

1038
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:32,680
一直以來把我照顧得這么好
such good care of me all this time.

1039
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,180
我希望他知道我有多感激
I hoped he knew how grateful I was.

1040
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,630
不  不  你得待在這里  大狗
Oh, no, no. You have to stay here, Big Dog.

1041
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,010
CJ  不  我應該跟你走才對
CJ, no. I'm supposed to come with you.

1042
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:55,270
CJ  等等  你在干什么
CJ, wait. What are you doing?

1043
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:59,660
不  不  你不能丟下我
No! No, you can't leave me.

1044
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,620
我和伊森說過我會保護你的
I told Ethan I would protect you.

1045
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,700
大狗
Big Dog.

1046
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,790
CJ  回來
CJ, come back.

1047
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:05,660
我得幫助你
I need to help you.

1048
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,200
大狗
Big Dog!

1049
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,620
求你了  帶我走吧
Please, take me with you.

1050
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,930
不  不  我不能失去你
No! No! I can't lose you.

1051
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:17,170
我不會放棄的  我絕不會放棄
I will never stop. I will never stop.

1052
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,050
慢一點
Slow... slow down.

1053
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:24,380
對不起  我跑不了更快了
I'm sorry, I... I just can't run any faster.

1054
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,560
來吧  大狗
Come on, Big Dog.

1055
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,430
大狗
Big Dog.

1056
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,650
來吧  來吧
Come on. Come on.

1057
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,320
我絕不會放棄
I will never stop.

1058
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,110
我絕不會放棄尋找你
I will never stop looking for you.

1059
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:02,050
日復一日  但不見CJ
Day after day passed, but no CJ.

1060
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,470
我不明白她為什么丟下我
I don't know why she left me behind.

1061
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,350
我等了好久
I waited so long.

1062
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:15,770
我越來越老
I got older and older.

1063
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,900
當時候到了  我能感覺到
And when it was time, I knew.

1064
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:36,910
我想我這輩子不會和CJ在一起了
I guess I wasn't gonna be with CJ in this life.

1065
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,970
我這輩子和喬過得很幸福
I had a good life with Joe.

1066
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:54,310
但是CJ沒有我的陪伴獨自生活  讓我很難過
But it was really hard knowing CJ was out there without me.

1067
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,520
我知道我們的旅程還沒有結束
I knew our journey wasn't over.

1068
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,710
這次回來我很嬌小
I came back small,

1069
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:09,460
但是這不能阻止我
but I was not gonna let that stop me.

1070
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,210
我已經出生過很多次  足以明白
I've been born enough times now to know

1071
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:14,740
肚子餓了  就得奮斗
that when you're hungry, you have got to fight for it.

1072
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:17,930
{\an8}超級領養大派對

1073
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:23,890

可供領養時間  今天
今天就帶我回家吧

1074
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,510
顯然我的成長階段已經結束了
So, apparently, my growing phase was over.

1075
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:22,380
我會保持嬌小的身材
I was gonna remain small.

1076
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,050
跟貓一樣大小
Cat-sized.

1077
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,140
如果我要找到CJ
If I was gonna find CJ,

1078
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:30,020
就需要一個新策略
I was gonna need a new strategy.

1079
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,430
瞧瞧你  你真可愛
Look at you. You are so cute.

1080
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,970
我已經屬于別人了
I already belong to somebody.

1081
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,810
我們想找年齡大一些的狗
We're really looking for an older dog.

1082
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:40,810
我有適合你們的完美選擇
I have the perfect dog for you.

1083
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,160
對不住  別往心里去
Sorry about that. Nothing personal.

1084
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,700
真惹人喜歡
How sweet.

1085
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,960
這個小可愛正好能裝進我的包里
This little cutie would fit in my purse.

1086
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,820
不行
Nope.

1087
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,570
看別的去
Keep moving.

1088
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,000
不錯啊  老伙計
Good going, old guy.

1089
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,870
她會很難搞的
She's gonna be tricky.

1090
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,750
等等  等等
Wait. Wait.

1091
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:03,500
我記得這個聲音
I know that sound.

1092
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:05,960
會是她嗎
Could it be?

1093
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,970
我覺得可能是
I think it might be.

1094
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,760
如果是呢
What if it is?

1095
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:15,180
很抱歉  麥克斯
I'm sorry, Max,

1096
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,150
但是我不得不帶你回收容所了
but I'm gonna have to take you back to the shelter.

1097
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:18,220
我必須搞清楚
I have to find out.

1098
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:22,440
我也不想這么做  但是...
I don't want to have to do this, but...

1099
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:24,950
-對不起  你是個好人  -麥克斯
- Sorry. You've been great. - Max!

1100
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,230
-謝謝你提供食物和水  -麥克斯  麥克斯
- Thanks for all the food and water. - Max, Max!

1101
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:40,000
這地方太大了
This place is huge.

1102
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:46,540
快讓開  有狗經過
Out of my way. Dog coming through.

1103
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:48,130
對不住
Sorry about that.

1104
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,440
身材小巧確實也有優勢
Being small does have some advantages.

1105
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,240
聞起來好香  只舔一下就好
Wow, that smells good. Maybe just one lick.

1106
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,370
不  算了
No, forget that.

1107
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,400
這次我不能再讓她離開了
I cannot let her get away this time.

1108
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,210
我什么都看不見
I can't see a thing.

我需要去更高的地方

廣場公園面積9.7英畝

我腿短但是跑得快

你在干什么
What you doing?

1119
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,690
不不不  過來
Oh, no, no, no, no. Come here.

1120
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,860
這東西怎么解開
How do you get this thing off?

1121
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,920
我來了
Here I am.

1122
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,280
來保護你
Here to protect you.

1123
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,760
還是很美味
Still delicious.

1124
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,370
你從哪來的
Where did you come from?

1125
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,350

謝謝
Thank you.

1127
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,460
我想這里發生了越獄
Think there was a jailbreak.

1128
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,120
這是麥克斯嗎
Is that Max?

1129
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,600
麥克斯
Max.

1130
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,350
你真可愛  麥克斯
You are such a love dog, Max.

1131
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,560
你是這世上唯一一個
You're the only person in the world

1132
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,180
沒被他咬的人
he hasn't tried to bite.

1133
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,150
就像是他選中了你
It's like he chose you.

1134
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,030
我不行  我和我男友一起住
I can't. I-I live with my boyfriend,

1135
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:24,180
他已經有一條狗了  我...
and he already has a dog. I...

1136
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,640
我真的不能再帶一條回家了
I really can't bring home another one.

1137
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,520
太遺憾了
That's too bad.

1138
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,490
他明天就要被安樂死了
He's scheduled to be put down tomorrow.

1139
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,410
等等  你是說真的嗎
Wait, are you serious?

1140
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:33,000
我們盡力把狗送到
W-We do our best to foster out

1141
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,500
無殺戮收容所  但是都住滿了
to no-kill shelters, but they're full.

1142
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,700
我們也滿了
We're full.

1143
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:39,480
麥克斯占的位置可以給另一條狗
Max is taking a place that could go to another dog.

1144
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,550
-但你不能...  -救助就像一條河流
- But you can't... - Rescue's like a river.

1145
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:43,540
必須要不停流動  不然就會倒退
It has to keep flowing, or it backs up.

1146
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:53,340
杜克
Duke?

1147
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:55,840
坐下
Sit.

1148
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,470
好的
Okay.

1149
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,010
坐下  麥克斯
Sit, Max.

1150
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:06,110
對  你坐下  就那樣不要動
Yeah. You sit, and you stay that way.

1151
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:07,060
明白了嗎
Get me?

1152
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:09,520
這是麥克斯
This is Max.

1153
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:12,240
你們倆會成為很好的朋友的
You two are gonna be very good friends.

1154
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:15,820
就像她說的  現在我是老大了
Like she said, I'm the boss now.

1155

Who is this man, and why is he

1164
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:39,650
-他進我們家了  CJ  -乖一點
- in our house, CJ? - Be nice.

1165
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:42,050
我知道  我知道  我也想你
I know, I know. I missed you, too.

1166
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:43,760
旅途順利嗎
How was your trip?

1167
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,530
-你們要把我擠扁了  -順利  你好嗎
- You're crushing me. - It was good. How are you?

1168
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:46,720
挺好的
Good. Yeah.

1169
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:50,440
這就是你跟我說起的那條狗
So, that's the dog you told me about.

1170
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:51,330
嗯
Yep.

1171
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,410
保持你的距離
Keep your distance.

1172
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:53,910
現在CJ由我保護
I'm protecting CJ now.

1173
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,230
很有個性
Great personality.

1174
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,120
他只是需要一點時間適應
He just needs a minute to warm up.

1175
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,040
有個玩伴杜克很高興
And Duke loves having a playmate.

1176
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,830
而且唱歌給兩條狗聽
And I guess playing your music for two dogs is

1177
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,160
比一條狗聽要好  對吧
better than one dog, right?

1178
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,530
對  它們是很好的聽眾
Right. They're a good audience.

1179
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:07,720
可惜狗不會買專輯
Too bad dogs don't buy records.

1180
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,750
等我準備好了  就會唱給別人聽  好嗎
Look, I'm gonna play for people when I'm ready. All right?

1181
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:22,440
CJ每天要遛一大群狗
Every day, CJ walked a huge group of dogs.

1182
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,180
他們知道我說了算
They knew I was in charge.

1183
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,240
林戈玩得很開心
So Ringo had a great time.

1184
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,080
-他尿了兩次  -很好
- He, um, peed twice. - Oh, great.

1185
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,080
-謝謝  -謝謝
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1186
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,440
-再見  -再見
- See ya. - Bye.

1187
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:45,120
這個盒子聞起來像...
This box has smells like, uh...

1188
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:46,990
麥克斯  你要去哪兒
Max, where are you going?

1189
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,210
抱歉
Sorry.

1190
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,250
-這邊  -麥克斯
- This way! - Max!

1191
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:53,870
麥克斯  回來
Max, come back.

1192
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,670
麥克斯
Max.

1193
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:02,340
麥克斯
Max.

1194
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,730
特倫特
Trent!

1195
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:08,570
-CJ  -特倫特
- CJ? - Trent?

1196
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:09,720
洛奇在哪
Where's Rocky?

1197
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,850
,  -你怎么在這...我...
- What are you...? - What are you...? I...

1198
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,370
這太奇怪了
This is so weird.

1199
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:17,040
我的狗剛把我拽到這來了
My dog just dragged me here.

1200
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,150
但我不知道...
But I don't know...

1201
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:20,900
你住在這里嗎
Do you live here?

1202
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,360
是的  我剛搬進來
Yeah, I just moved in.

1203
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,700
這個小家伙是誰
Who's this little guy?

1204
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:26,750
這是麥克斯  小心點
That's Max. Be careful.

1205
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,080
他不是很友好
He's not very friendly.

1206
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,540
特倫特  我好高興見到你
Trent, I'm so glad to see you.

1207
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:31,870
洛奇在哪
Where's Rocky?

1208
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:33,870
我覺得他挺友好的
He seems pretty friendly to me.

1209
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,800
真不敢相信你在紐約
I can't believe you're in New York.

1210
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,220
我從來沒覺得你喜歡大城市
I never saw you as a big-city guy.

1211
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,520
我之前在倫敦住了一陣
Well, I was in London for a while.

1212
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,720
然后這里有了新機遇
And when the opportunity came up here,

1213
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:50,240
我心里想  "為什么不試試呢"
I thought to myself, "Why not give it a try?"

1214
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,780
我的鼻子告訴我洛奇不在了
My nose told me Rocky was gone.

1215
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:53,860
可憐的特倫特
Poor Trent.

1216
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:56,650
人沒有狗是不可能幸福的
A person can't be happy without a dog.

1217
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,150
這個地方很棒
Well, it's a pretty nice place.

1218
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:00,700
你肯定過得不錯
You must be doing okay.

1219
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,990
我想知道這里的吃的都放在哪里
I wonder what the snack situation is here.

1220
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:05,460
抱歉
Sorry.

1221
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,570
你了解我的  我一向循規蹈矩
You know me. I follow the rules.

1222
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:10,450
我一直很佩服你完全不在乎那些規矩
I always admired how you didn't care about the rules.

1223
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:14,500
是啊  格洛麗亞沒有教會我遵守規矩
Yeah, well, Gloria didn't exactly teach me to follow rules.

1224
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:16,060
你媽怎么樣
How is your mom?

1225
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,630
我不知道
I don't know.

1226
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,920
我好幾年沒和她聯系了
I haven't spoken to her in years.

1227
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:23,310
你的音樂生涯呢
How's the music career?

1228
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,730
挺好的
Good. Yeah.

1229
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:26,150
我是說挺不容易的
I mean, it's hard.

1230
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:28,980
而且  我現在要遛這么多狗
Plus, I'm walking all these dogs now

1231
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,400
才能付清賬單
just to pay the bills.

1232
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,430
所以...
So it's...

1233
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:33,060
真是松了口氣
That's a relief.

1234
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:34,320
有那么一瞬間  我以為你變成了
For a second, I thought you'd become

1235
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,060
那種失控的囤狗女士
one of those out-of-control dog ladies.

1236
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:40,620
CJ很開心  這讓她笑了
CJ was happy, and it made her laugh.

1237
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,080
她跟巴里在一起時從沒笑過
She never laughs with Barry.

1238
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,780
好了  我該走了
All right, well, I should probably get going.

1239
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,990
好
Yeah.

1240
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:51,700
我女友下周末會來
My girlfriend is coming in next weekend.

1241
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:53,760
也許我們可以跟你和你男友一起
Maybe we could do a double date

1242
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,120
來個四人約會
with you and your boyfriend?

1243
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,210
好的  我們很樂意
Yeah, sure, we'd love that.

1244
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:58,330
好
Okay.

1245
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,500
好
Okay.

1246
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:04,300
離開特倫特后  CJ似乎很傷心
CJ seemed sad after we left Trent.

1247
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:06,690
我能看出來她想要特倫特加入我們的家庭
I could tell she wanted Trent in our pack.

1248
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:07,970
我也想
So did I.

1249
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,930
也就是說...
Which meant...

1250
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:13,720
巴里必須走
Barry had to go.

1251
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,270
CJ
CJ!

1252
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:24,480
這是巴里的
Barry's.

1253
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,870
CJ
CJ!

1254
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:36,130
我已經憋了一整天了
I've been holding this in all day,

1255
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:37,580
該釋放了
and it's go time.

1256
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:48,380
CJ
CJ!

1257
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,630
棒極了
Yes!

1258
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:55,940
我只是說說  但是如果要咬他才能趕走他
Just saying, if I have to bite this guy to get rid of him,

1259
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:56,820
我絕對會咬
I absolutely will.

1260
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:00,070
領養一條狗真是個愚蠢的決定
Adopting a dog was such a stupid decision.

1261
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,730
你為什么要這么說
Why are you saying that?

1262
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:04,270
看看你  CJ
Look at you, CJ.

1263
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:06,250
你的事業毫無前途
Your career is nowhere.

1264
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,580
好吧  謝謝評價  巴里
Okay, thanks, Barry.

1265
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,830
我不需要別人幫我變得更郁悶
I don't need any help feeling bad about myself.

1266
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:12,820
是嗎  我只是覺得你沒有天賦
Yeah, well, I just don't think you have what it takes.

1267
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:16,200
我不想住在這里了
I don't want to be here anymore.

1268
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:19,290
你要去哪
Where are you gonna go?

1269
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:21,430
你退租了自己的公寓  也沒有錢
You gave up your apartment. You have no money.

1270
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:23,710
是啊  我會想辦法的
Yeah, well, I will figure something out.

1271
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:26,670
-不許離開我  -別碰我
- Don't walk away from me. - Don't touch me.

1272
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:34,510
我們  不喜歡  你
We... don't... like... you.

1273

Thanks.

阿曼達下周二回來
Amanda comes back next Tuesday.

1276

她說你可以暫住
She said it would be okay.

1277
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,670
我們這里不允許養狗  所以把他藏好
We're not allowed dogs here, so keep him on the down-low.

1278
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:59,830
好的  謝謝
Okay. Thanks.

1279
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:02,240
我把巴里趕走了
So I got rid of Barry,

1280
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,510
但是特倫特并沒有加入我們
but Trent didn't join our pack.

1281
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,050
這說不通啊
It didn't make any sense.

CJ  你怎么回事
CJ, what's wrong with you?

- Don't you smell Trent? - Thank you.

1302
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:01,260
一定要攔到出租車  我可不想遲到
Okay, make sure you get that cab over there. I don't want to be late.

1303
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,540
-麥克斯  噓  -我明白

特倫特  我們在這兒  我來了
Trent, we're right here! Here I come.

1309
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:13,560
張開你的雙臂  接住我
Open your arms and catch me.

1310
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:15,870
麥克斯
Max.

1311
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,020
我說了接住我
I said catch me.

1312
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:20,310
你認識這條狗
You know this dog?

1313
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:23,070
你怎么還不把那只貓放下來抱我
Why don't you put that fancy cat down and pick me up?

-CJ  這是莉斯爾  -你好
- CJ, Liesl. - Hi.

1319
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:35,750
你好  很高興認識你
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1320
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,150
我給你留言了好幾次
So I left you a bunch of messages.

1321
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:39,030
你都沒有回我
You didn't get back.

1322
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:41,350
-一切都還好嗎  -是的
- Is everything okay? - Oh, yeah.

1323
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:44,690
是的  抱歉  一切都很好
Yeah, sorry. Um, everything's great.

1324
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,840
真的都很好
Really great, actually.

1325

I, um... I-I was gonna, um...

I was...

1327
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:55,480
CJ
C-CJ?

1328
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,400
抱歉
Sorry.

1329
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:03,530
這里聞起來可比我們昨天睡的地方好多了
This smells way better than the place we slept last night.

1330
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:06,920
你家真漂亮
Place looks great.

1331
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,240
嗯
Yeah.

1332
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:11,730
你可以住在這邊的客房
You can stay right here in the guest bedroom

1333
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:13,290
直到你找到住處
until you find your own place.

1334
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:17,760
很抱歉  我也不想給你添麻煩的
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be such a pain.

1335
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,490
你沒給我添麻煩
You're not being a pain.

1336
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,960
我只是需要一點時間讓生活重新回到正軌
I just need a little time to get back on my feet.

1337
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:24,660
特倫特
Trent?

1338
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:27,000
我能跟你單獨說幾句嗎
Can I speak with you for a second?

1339
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:29,740
好了
Okay.

1340
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:35,140
我猜那條狗不會走路
I guess that dog doesn't know how to walk.

1341
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,220
我好像給你惹麻煩了
Feel like maybe I'm getting you into trouble.

1342
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:41,380
沒關系的
It's fine.

1343
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:44,110
莉斯爾是個小醋壇子
Liesl can be a little jealous.

1344
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:48,320
我們能坐一會兒嗎
Is it okay if we sit down?

1345
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:49,810
我累死了
I'm exhausted.

1346
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,030
當然可以
Yeah, sure.

1347
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:52,710
你沒事吧
You okay?

1348
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,040
沒事  只是...
Yeah. Yeah, just, uh...

1349
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:57,840
也許我工作太拼了
think I'm working too much.

1350
01:10:58,990 --> 01:10:59,720
讓一讓
Excuse me.

1351
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:03,030
特倫特告訴我你是職業遛狗人
So, Trent tells me that you're a professional dog walker.

1352
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:05,060
你是怎么了
What happened to you?

1353
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:06,230
是的
Yeah.

1354
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:07,240
不過只是副業
Just on the side.

1355
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,430
音樂才是我真正在乎的事業
Music is what I really care about.

1356
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:11,960
這么說你有樂隊
So you have a band?

1357
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,360
沒有樂隊
Nope. No band.

1358
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,020
只有我和我的吉他
Just me and my guitar.

1359
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:16,880
那你在哪里演出
Where do you play?

1360
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,050
我還沒有正式演出過
I haven't exactly booked a gig yet.

1361
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:21,110
只是一直在寫自己的歌
Kind of just been working on my songs.

1362
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,810
面對聽眾前  我想先準備好全套曲目
I wanted to have a whole set before I started playing in public.

1363
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,560
所以  音樂才是副業
So, I mean, music is on the side,

1364
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,470
遛狗才是你真正的職業  對嗎
and dog walking is your real job, then, right?

1365
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,290
莉斯爾沒有撒尿標記
Liesl didn't pee on anything,

1366
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:38,490
但她絕對是在宣誓主權
but she was definitely marking her territory.

1367
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:44,260
等不及開飯了
Ready for food here.

1368
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,070
快點  把碗放下
Let's go. Put the bowl down.

1369
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:47,150
好好好
Okay, okay.

1370
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,400
坐下
Sit.

1371
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:51,770
好孩子
Good boy.

1372
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,590
太美味了  最美味的一餐
This is delicious. Best meal ever.

1373
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:57,960
慢點  麥克斯
Slow down, Max.

1374
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:58,980
我吃完了
I'm done.

1375
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,080
特倫特
Trent!

1376
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,140
難熬的一天
Tough day?

1377
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,130
不算太糟
Not too bad.

1378
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:10,730
我可能只是缺覺
Think I just need some sleep.

1379
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,320
-肯定是  -你好啊  小家伙
- Yeah, I bet. - Oh, hey, little guy.

1380
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,720
我剛剛吃了一生中最美味的一餐
I literally just had the best meal of my life.

1381
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:20,040
特倫特回到我們的家庭了  真好
Good to have Trent back in the pack.

1382
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,940
我能說幾句也許不太中聽的話嗎
Can I say something you may not want to hear?

1383
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:25,220
說吧
Sure.

1384
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:27,750
我覺得你怯場
I think you have stage fright.

1385
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:29,490
等等  這氣味
Wait, that smell.

1386
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:31,110
我
I...

1387
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:34,420
行  好吧
Okay, fine.

1388
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:38,050
也許我是有點怯場
Maybe I have a little stage fright.

1389
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,790
但是...我不知道
But... well, I don't know.

1390
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:43,100
也許我的歌還不夠好
Maybe my songs just aren't ready yet.

1391
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,600
這個嘛
Well...

1392
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,610
我還是莫莉的時候就聞過這種氣味
I remember that smell from when I was Molly.

1393
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:50,870
如果你不演唱  怎么能知道
How will you know whether they're ready

1394
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:51,990
你的歌夠不夠好
if you don't play them?

1395
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:53,540
對嗎
Right?

1396
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,140
這個小把戲真可愛
That's a cute little trick.

1397
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,710
我聞到氣味了  我該得到吃的了
I smelled the smell. Now I get a treat.

1398
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,300
看到了嗎
You see that?

1399
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:21,560
特倫特  你這種疲憊感持續多久了
Trent, how long have you been wiped out like this?

1400
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:24,290
"疲憊感"
"Wiped out"?

1401
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:32,580
實際上...我從倫敦搬回來后就一直是這樣
Actually... since I moved back from London.

1402
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:36,240
我可能還在倒時差
I guess I'm... I'm just jet-lagged.

1403
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:40,520
是不是去找醫生看看比較好
You... do you think maybe you should see a doctor?

1404
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,980
只是檢查一下
Just to make sure everything's okay?

1405
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,660
你在轉移話題  逃避談論你的音樂生涯
You're changing the subject from your musical career.

1406
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:48,500
我會好好考慮的  好嗎
I am gonna think about that, okay?

1407
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,590
你去找個醫生看看好嗎
Will you just please go see a doctor?

1408
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:54,740
-好吧  -打擾一下
- Okay. - Excuse me.

1409
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:57,740
你還欠我吃的呢
You owe me a treat.

1410
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:06,230
{\an8}格洛麗亞

1411
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:07,210
格洛麗亞  別再打了
Gloria, stop calling me.

1412
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:12,250
? 有一個女孩...  ?
♪ There's a girl... ♪

1413
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:14,270
請進
Come in.

1414
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:18,130
莉斯爾來了
Liesl's here.

1415
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:18,780
你能出來一下嗎
Could you come out?

1416
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:20,370
我有事要告訴你們兩個
I want to tell you both something.

1417
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,010
好的
Sure.

1418
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,860
他們確定是癌癥嗎
And they're sure it's cancer?

1419
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:33,790
確定
They're sure.

1420
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,730
他們跟你談了哪些治療方案
What did they tell you about treatment options?

1421
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:40,910
好消息是  確診及時
Well, the good news is, uh, they caught it early.

1422
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,840
但是我得做化療
But I'll have to do chemo.

1423
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:47,920
你一定要去醫院嗎
Do you have to go to the hospital?

1424
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,600
我討厭醫院  我害怕醫院
I hate hospitals. They terrify me.

1425
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,360
你知道的
You know that.

1426
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,120
那就千萬別得癌癥
Then definitely don't get cancer.

1427
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:58,810
你笑什么
Why are you laughing?

1428
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,010
開個玩笑而已
It was... it was just a joke.

1429
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:05,130
你覺得現在是開玩笑的時候嗎
Do you really think that this is the time to joke?

1430
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,370
我要去透透氣
I... I need some air.

1431
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:15,920
會沒事的
It'll be okay.

1432
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,380
謝謝
Thanks.

1433
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:33,480
她怎么說
And what did she say?

1434
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:37,040
她說她可不想當護士
She said she's not up for being a nurse.

1435
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,800
真冷血
That is pretty cold.

1436
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,150
抱歉
Sorry.

1437
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,170
也許這樣更好
Maybe it's for the better.

1438
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:56,060
不然她大概也會用這件事來搏關注
She'd probably find some way of making it about herself anyway.

1439
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,230
你知道你能戰勝癌癥的
You know you're gonna beat this.

1440
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:09,270
對嗎
Right?

1441
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:11,860
當然
Definitely.

1442
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,460
應該吧
I-I think.

1443
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,110
我還是不敢相信
I-I still can't believe this.

1444
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:23,090
我哪兒也不會去
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

1445
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:26,450
謝謝  CJ
Thanks, CJ.

1446
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:29,240
一切都會好起來的
Everything's gonna be fine.

1447
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:44,360
他們讓我想起了伊森和漢娜年輕的時候
They remind me of Ethan and Hannah when they were young.

1448
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,370
他們想舔對方嗎
Do they want to lick each other?

1449
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:54,720
我得去醫院了  麥克斯
I got to go to the hospital, Max.

1450
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,230
等我回來  我們就好好出去散個步  好嗎
When I get back, we'll go on a long walk, okay?

1451
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:00,350
特倫特走了  CJ也經常離家
Trent went away, and then CJ was gone a lot.

1452
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:02,980
別動  麥克斯
Stay, Max.

1453
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,500
如果你不想帶我散步  為什么要提起來呢
Why say "walk" if you don't mean "walk"?

1454
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:11,960
特倫特回家了  他經常在睡覺
Trent came home, and he slept a lot.

1455
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,940
睡的時間比我都長
He slept even more than me.

1456
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:17,660
謝謝
Thank you.

1457
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:21,890
我一直在咬這個癢癢的地方
And I'd been biting at this itch for a long time.

1458
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,110
你真的很喜歡咬那個地方  是嗎
Boy, you're really chewing that spot, aren't you?

1459
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,620
也許我該帶你去看獸醫
Maybe I should take you to the vet.

1460
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:29,130
好了
Okay.

1461
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,170
味道如何
So?

1462
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:38,210
非常好
It's really good.

1463
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:39,340
真的嗎
Really?

1464
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,040
不  很難喝
No, it's horrible.

1465
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:45,640
我來嘗嘗
Here, I'm gonna try it.

1466
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:52,990
真的很難喝
It's really bad.

1467
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,490
雖然特倫特一直待在家里
Trent wore clothes for outside

1468
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:56,610
但他一直穿著外套
even though he always stayed inside.

1469
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:59,550
-很健康  味道也很健康  -他看起來很滑稽
- It's healthy. Tastes healthy. - He looked ridiculous.

1470
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:03,390
很抱歉  麥克斯
I'm sorry, Max.

1471
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:06,510
等你的腿愈合了  我們就摘掉它  好嗎
As soon as your leg heals, we'll take it off, okay?

1472
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:16,950
我也不知道  麥克斯
I don't know, Max.

1473
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:20,030
每次我想起在聽眾面前演唱
Every time I think about playing in public,

1474
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:22,710
我的心就會砰砰地跳
my heart just starts racing.

1475
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:27,120
我也不知道  也許我沒有那種天賦
I don't know. Maybe I don't have what it takes.

1476
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:35,020
真希望這張床是培根做的
I wish this bed was made out of bacon.

1477
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:41,840
你不小心把你的鑰匙給別人了
You accidentally gave someone your key?

1478
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:44,160
還有比這更美好的生活嗎
Does life get any better than this?

1479
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:48,630
是醫生
It's the doctor.

1480
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:52,570
你好  羅賓斯醫生
Hi, Dr. Robbins.

1481
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:57,490
好的  那是什么意思
Okay, so what does that mean?

1482
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,010
好的
Okay.

1483
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:03,770
謝謝  我會的
Thank you. Will do.

1484
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,430
她怎么說
What did she say?

1485
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:12,080
她說我的檢查結果沒問題
Sh-Sh-She said my... my scans were clean.

1486
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:16,910
我沒有癌癥了
I'm cancer-free.

1487
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:18,590
-真的嗎  -是的
- Really? - Yeah.

1488
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,490
天哪
Oh, my God.

1489
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,380
我不知道我們為什么這么高興
I don't know why we're happy,

1490
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,660
但我也高興起來了
but it makes me happy.

1491
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,980
過來  過來
Come here. Come here.

1492
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:45,870
對  對
Right, right.

1493
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:47,420
特倫特又陪我們散步了
Trent came on our walks again.

1494
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:50,190
有他回來真好
It was so great having him back.

1495
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:51,990
格洛麗亞一直在給我發短信
Gloria keeps texting me.

1496
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,860
她要來紐約了
She's coming to New York.

1497
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:55,830
你要見她嗎
You're gonna go see her?

1498
01:19:56,910 --> 01:19:57,640
不知道
I don't know.

1499
01:19:58,570 --> 01:19:59,950
好多年沒見了
It's been years, you know?

1500
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:02,800
再說  她讓我覺得很自卑
Plus, she makes me feel terrible about myself.

1501
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,740
她對你的影響還是很大
She still has too much power over you.

1502
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:05,780
如果你近看她
If you see her up close,

1503
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:08,160
你會發現  她只是個普通人
you'll just realize she's just another person.

1504
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:10,330
是啊  也許你說的對
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1505
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:16,360
你幫我挺過了癌癥
You just got me through cancer.

1506
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:17,850
你可以直面格洛麗亞
You can face Gloria.

1507
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,500
現在輪到我支持你了
Now I can be here for you.

1508
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:25,470
來吧  快舔臉
Come on, lick faces.

1509
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:27,690
特倫特
Trent...

1510
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,950
快舔  你們都想這么做
Do it. You both want to.

1511
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,930
你真是個好朋友
You're a really good friend.

1512
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:43,730
他們什么時候才會...
Are they ever going to...

1513
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,540
我聞到了新鮮的便便
I smell fresh poop!

1514
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:48,000
{\an8}焦褐咖啡

1515
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,020
這邊
Right this way.

1516
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:50,940
我不明白
I didn't understand

1517
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,410
-為什么CJ在發抖  -謝謝
- why CJ was trembling. - Thank you.

1518
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,360
沒有風  天氣也不冷
It wasn't windy or cold.

1519
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,530
請坐吧
Please, sit down.

1520
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:11,140
抱歉  我得帶著他一起來
I'm sorry I had to bring him with me.

1521
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:12,150
當然了  沒關系的
Oh, of course. That's okay.

1522
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:16,470
你真漂亮
You're so beautiful.

1523
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:19,160
-喝點水吧  -謝謝
- Some water. - Thank you.

1524
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:23,510
你一直和特倫特住在一起嗎
So, you've... you've been living with Trent?

1525
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:26,300
你們在交往嗎
Is that... Are you two... are you dating?

1526
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:29,650
他一直都對你有意思
Well, he always had such a thing for you.

1527
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,510
不  我們只是朋友
No, we're, um... we're just friends.

1528
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,360
你的音樂怎么樣了
And what is going on with your music?

1529
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:42,180
只是寫寫歌
Just writing songs and...

1530
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:45,380
我在考慮錄樣帶
you know, thinking about maybe making a demo.

1531
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,910
面對聽眾
It's gonna be...

1532
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,170
你肯定會害怕吧
scary to get up in front of an audience.

1533
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,360
嗯  我還在考慮自己到底是不是這塊料
Yeah. Kind of wondering if I'm cut out for it.

1534
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:57,020
如果你不去試試  怎么會知道呢
Well, if you don't try, you'll never know.

1535
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:00,520
你來這干什么呢  格洛麗亞
So, what are you doing here, Gloria?

1536
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:02,820
先說一聲  我可沒錢
Just so you know, I don't have any money.

1537
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:05,720
我不想從你這要錢
No, I don't want money from you.

1538
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:09,040
格洛麗亞的感覺變了
I felt a different feeling from Gloria.

1539
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:11,430
不是憤怒  而是難過
Not angry. Sad.

1540
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:13,600
-麥克斯  她討厭狗  -天哪
- Max, she hates dogs. - Oh, God.

1541
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:15,610
我能抱抱他嗎
Can I... can I hold him?

1542
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,420
好的
Yeah.

1543
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:22,650
想和我一起坐坐嗎
Want to come s-sit with me?

1544
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,140
如果說誰最需要狗
If anybody ever needed a dog,

1545
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:26,550
那肯定是格洛麗亞
it was Gloria.

1546
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:28,470
她需要感受愛
She needed love.

1547
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:32,300
有這么一條狗
It must be nice to have...

1548
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,530
無條件地愛你  感覺肯定很好
something that loves you like this, without conditions.

1549
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,530
因為你大概很需要無條件的愛
Because you probably really needed that.

1550
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:43,620
是啊
Yeah, I did.

1551
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:46,960
克拉里蒂  我...
So, Clarity, I...

1552
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:50,770
我已經戒酒了
I have been sober for, um,

1553
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:55,190
戒了九個月零十三天
nine months and 13 days.

1554
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,100
而且
And...

1555
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:59,770
我不是一個好媽媽
I was not a good mother.

1556
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:05,920
我很抱歉  克拉里蒂
And I am s-so sorry, Clarity.

1557
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:08,520
還有
And...

1558
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:10,840
如果你愿意
if you'd let me, I'd...

1559
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,870
我真的很想回到你的生活中
really like to be a part of your life.

1560
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:20,820
我也很想相信你  格洛麗亞
I really want to trust you, Gloria.

1561
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:26,420
我只是不確定自己能不能做到
I just don't know if I can.

1562
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:33,120
下周就是你爸爸的生日了
So, it's your father's birthday next week.

1563
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,460
我不知道你是否知道
I don't know if you knew that.

1564
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:38,100
而且你馬上就要到
And you are about to turn the age

1565
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,510
他去世時的年齡了
that he was when he died.

1566
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,210
太難以置信了
Which is so crazy.

1567
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:54,370
我這兒有一些他寫的信
I have some, uh, letters from him

1568
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,470
是我懷孕時他寄給我的
that he wrote to me when I was pregnant...

1569
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:00,020
懷著你的時候
with you.

1570
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,990
你的爺爺奶奶把信給了我
and your grandparents gave them to me.

1571
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:07,220
我覺得你應該收下
And I... I think you should have them.

1572
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:16,050
他去世的時候  我很氣憤
I was so angry when he died.

1573
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:18,580
也很害怕
And... scared.

1574
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:21,530
我迷茫了
And I was just... lost.

1575
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:25,200
但現在  我明白了
But, um, I realize now

1576
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:27,820
你應該知道他是個什么樣的人  這很重要
it is so important that you know who he was.

1577
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,170
因為他...
Because he was...

1578
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,600
我不想看這些信  格洛麗亞
I don't want to read these, Gloria.

1579
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:37,090
你想看的
Oh, yes, you do.

1580
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:39,020
沒錯
Yeah.

1581
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:40,950
在這件事上  你得相信我
Just trust me on that one thing.

1582
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:44,880
還有
And, um...

1583
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:48,230
我知道這也許需要時間
I know it-it may take time.

1584
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,750
我真心希望有一天你可以原諒我
I do hope that someday you can forgive me.

1585
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:01,120
原來格洛麗亞也挺會撓耳朵的
Turns out Gloria's a pretty good ear scratcher, too.

1586
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:03,160
或許她還有希望
Maybe there is hope for her, after all.

1587
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,000
這些紙聞起來像漢娜的兒子
The papers smelled like Hannah's boy.

1588
01:25:09,150 --> 01:25:12,420
讓我想起了伊森和漢娜  還有農場
They made me think of Ethan and Hannah and the farm.

1589
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,370
格洛麗亞  我很想你
Gloria, I miss you.

1590
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:20,350
我想我會被摩托羅拉聘用
I think I'm gonna get the Motorola job.

1591
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,210
上周我看了一間公園旁的公寓
I saw an apartment next to a park

1592
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:25,140
很適合帶孩子一起住
that would be perfect for the baby.

1593
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:27,500
我知道我們都很害怕
I know we're both scared,

1594
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,760
但我終于開始明白了
but I finally have some clarity.

1595
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:32,320
我們那么年輕  都不知道自己在干些什么
We're so young, and we don't know what we're doing.

1596
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:34,060
但我們擁有彼此
But we have each other,

1597
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:36,310
我們會一起想明白該怎么辦
and we will figure it out together.

1598
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:40,270
我們可以去密歇根州的農場  跟我媽和伊森
We can spend the summer with my mom and Ethan

1599
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:41,580
一起度過這個夏天
at the farm in Michigan.

1600
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,750
我知道我媽肯定可以幫我們很多忙
I know my mom will be super helpful to us.

1601
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:47,740
要當奶奶了  她非常興奮
She is so excited to be a grandmother.

1602
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:51,340
我等不及想見我們的女兒了
I cannot wait to meet our little girl.

1603
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:56,860
怎樣才能養育一個堅強  無所畏懼的孩子
How do you raise a child to be strong and bold?

1604
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,920
讓她相信自己
To believe in herself?

1605
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:01,760
有你當她的媽媽  她肯定會有一個好的開始
She'll have a good start with you as her mom.

1606
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:05,850
我為她  為我們抱有很多的期待
I have so many dreams for her and for us.

1607
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,770
真不敢相信我會接受我媽的建議  但是...
Can't believe I'm taking my mother's advice, but...

1608
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:13,250
如果不試  我永遠也不知道  對嗎  麥克斯
if I don't try it, I'll never know, will I, Max?

1609
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:16,920
-對嗎  -有時候  你能做到的最好的事
- Will I? - Sometimes the best thing you can do

1610
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,270
就是陪在她身邊
is just be there.

1611
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:19,470
就算你的肋骨被壓著了
Even if your ribs get

1612
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:21,700
讓你有點憋不住
a little bit crushed and it makes you want to go.

01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:08,250
好吧
Okay.

1660
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:12,170
不知道城里的狗會不會喜歡這地方
Well, I wonder what a city dog's gonna make of this place.

1661
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:14,590
農場  我回來了
The farm! I'm back!

1662
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:15,380
我們去看看吧
Should we check it out?

1663
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,240
我聞到馬狗了
I smell horse-dogs!

1664
01:29:19,690 --> 01:29:23,140
我聞到漢娜了  我聞到我的男孩了
I smell Hannah! I smell my boy!

1665
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:35,660
你好
Hello.

1666
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,260
你是從哪來的
Where'd you come from?

1667
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,090
伊森  是我
Ethan, it's me!

1668
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:45,280
我是貝利  貝利  貝利  貝利
It's Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

1669
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:47,520
伊森  外面怎么了
Ethan, wh-what's going on out here?

1670
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,730
-怎么...  -你看啊
- What...? - Look at this.

1671
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:52,630
你真是個小可愛
Aren't you a cutie pie?

1672
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:57,130
你的主人是誰
Who is your owner?

1673
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,030
我想...
I think...

1674
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,390
你可能是我奶奶  漢娜
you might be my Grandma Hannah?

1675
01:30:12,730 --> 01:30:13,470
我是
I am.

1676
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:14,640
CJ
CJ?

1677
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:33,040
天吶  這個地方感覺很熟悉
God, I feel like I know this place.

1678
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:34,960
當然了
Of course you do.

1679
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,680
這是你家
It's home.

1680
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:38,630
CJ
CJ?

1681
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:40,370
你長大了
Y-You grew up.

1682
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:45,400
這是你的狗嗎
I-Is that... is that your dog?

1683
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:48,010
是的  這是麥克斯
Yeah, that's, um... this is Max.

1684
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,200
小心  他不是很友好
Be careful. He's not very friendly.

1685
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:52,900
是啊  你是個殺手
Yeah, you're a killer.

1686
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:55,980
好吧
Okay.

1687
01:30:56,330 --> 01:30:57,740
我照你說的做了  伊森
I did what you told me, Ethan.

1688
01:30:57,740 --> 01:30:59,900
很不容易  花了很長時間  但我做到了
It was not easy. It took a long time, but I did it.

1689
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:01,310
我把CJ帶回家了
I brought CJ home.

1690
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:07,100
你好
Hello.

1691
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:08,800
你好
Hi.

1692
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:11,650
很高興認識你們
Nice to meet you.

1693
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:17,700
-天吶  -真漂亮  你看
- My gosh. - Oh, that's beautiful. Look at that.

1694
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,380
你看這張
Look at this one.

1695
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:27,480
你們兩個認識多久了
So, how long have you two known each other?

1696
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:31,810
從十歲起我們就是最好的朋友
Best friends since we were ten years old.

1697
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:34,340
那你們不是...
So, you're not, uh...

1698
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:36,520
不是  不是
No. No.

1699
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,620
我們只是朋友
We're, um... we're just friends.

1700
01:31:43,990 --> 01:31:45,740
天吶  我看起來好開心
Gosh, I look so happy.

1701
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,300
為什么我媽媽不讓我見你們
Why did my mother keep me away from you?

1702
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:55,600
你爸爸去世時  格洛麗亞年紀很小
When your father died, Gloria was so young,

1703
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:00,080
我覺得她認為全世界都在跟她作對
and I think she thought that the world was against her.

1704
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:03,550
她不明白我們是站在她那邊的
And she couldn't see that we were on her side.

1705
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:04,700
對嗎
Right?

1706
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:10,300
我再去拿幾本相冊來
I'm gonna get some more photo albums.

1707
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:11,980
貝利交給你
Here. Take Bailey.

1708
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:14,120
他叫麥克斯
His-his name's Max.

1709
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:18,620
好吧  麥克斯
Okay... Max.

1710
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:22,030
他真正的名字叫貝利
You know, his real name is Bailey.

1711
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:24,510
對吧  狗老大
Ain't that right, Boss Dog?

1712
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:25,960
沒錯
That's right.

1713
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:28,960
我喜歡聽他叫我"狗老大"
I love when he calls me "Boss Dog."

1714
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,430
我唯一想不通的是
The only thing I can't figure

1715
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:33,540
狗老大怎么會變得這么嬌小
is how Boss Dog can be such a little guy.

1716
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:37,900
等等  你是說我的狗其實是你的狗
Wait, so, my dog is actually your dog?

1717
01:32:38,730 --> 01:32:40,550
我把他永久租借
He's on permanent loan.

1718
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:42,140
給你了
To you.

1719
01:32:42,710 --> 01:32:43,410
好吧
Okay.

1720
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,410
貝利是伊森小時候的狗
Bailey was Ethan's dog when he was a kid,

1721
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:55,990
他總是說貝利變成別的狗回來了
and he always said that Bailey came back as a different dog

1722
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:59,450
讓我們在分開多年后重新走到一起
and brought us back together after many years apart.

1723
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:02,880
現在他認為麥克斯就是貝利
And now he thinks that Max is Bailey

1724
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,280
貝利讓你回到了我們身邊
and Bailey's brought you to us.

1725
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,050
她認為我老糊涂了
She thinks I lost my marbles.

1726
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:07,820
這個嘛
Oh, well...

1727
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:10,070
你就是這么想的
Yeah, you do.

1728
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:13,440
-這件事上我很肯定  -好吧
- I know what I'm talking about on this one. - Sure.

1729
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:17,570
你也不相信我  對嗎CJ
You don't believe me, either, CJ, do you?

1730
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:22,830
關于那條狗  你還有很多不知道的
There's a lot you don't know about that dog.

1731
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:27,160
我可以證明給你看
I could show you.

1732
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:33,110
-來吧  貝利  -來了
- Come on, Bailey. - Coming.

1733
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:36,450
好吧
Okay.

1734
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:43,030
我很久沒做過這個了
Yeah, it's been a while since I've done this.

1735
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:45,030
我曾經是站著做的
I used to do it standing up.

1736
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:47,320
好了  你...
All right, you...

1737
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:48,820
準備好了嗎
Okay, you ready?

1738
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,650
我們像以前那樣做吧
Let's do it just like we used to.

1739
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:53,000
好
Okay.

1740
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:54,660
一
One.

1741
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:57,110
二
Two.

1742
01:33:58,030 --> 01:33:59,180
三
Three.

1743
01:33:59,180 --> 01:33:59,860
上
Go!

1744
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:09,950
這東西什么時候變得這么大了
When did this thing get so big?

1745
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:16,860
很厲害吧
Pr-Pretty great, right?

1746
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:19,290
什么
Wha...?

1747
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:21,450
只不過現在...
Only... only now the...

1748
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:24,120
橄欖球比他還重
The football weighs more than he does.

1749
01:34:24,590 --> 01:34:25,330
等等
Wait.

1750
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:30,260
-他怎么...  -我也不明白為什么
- How did... - I don't know how or what.

1751
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:32,920
貝利臨死前
When Bailey died,

1752
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:35,890
我讓他照顧你
I told him to take care of you.

1753
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:37,790
保護你
To protect you.

1754
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:41,370
我相信他做到了
And I believe that's what he did.

1755
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,100
對不對  狗老大
Ain't that right, Boss Dog?

1756
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,410
終于想明白時  感覺有點奇怪吧
It's kind of weird when you finally get it, right?

1757
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:59,180
特倫特
Trent?

1758
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:01,620
特倫特
Trent!

1759
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:03,150
他在那邊
He's over there.

1760
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:04,500
我得走了  伊森
I got to go, Ethan.

1761
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:05,900
你讓我保護她的
You told me to protect her.

1762
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:29,940
特倫特  特倫特
Trent. Trent!

1763
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:33,550
怎么了  出什么事了
Wh-What is it? What's wrong?

1764
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:37,650
沒什么
Nothing.

1765
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:39,830
沒出事
Nothing's wrong.

1766
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,270
特倫特  麥克斯就是莫莉
Max was Molly, Trent.

1767
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,510
所以他能聞出你病了
That's how he knew you were sick.

1768
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:56,660
-什么  -麥克斯就是莫莉
- What? - Max was Molly.

1769
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:59,530
在莫莉之前  他是伊森的狗  貝利
And before Molly, he was Ethan's dog, Bailey.

1770
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:02,580
我覺得大狗也是他
And I think he was also Big Dog,

1771
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:06,020
他跟我握爪  還幫我贏了五十美元
who gave me its paw and helped me win 50 dollars.

1772
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:07,270
好吧
Okay.

1773
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:11,520
麥克斯讓我們走到了一起  特倫特
Max brought us together, Trent.

1774
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:15,110
他找到了我  然后又找到了你
He found me, and then he found you,

1775
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:18,210
然后他救了你的命
and then he saved your life.

1776
01:36:20,630 --> 01:36:22,120
這一切都是為了讓我們在一起
All so we could be together.

1777
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:23,450
拜托
Come on.

1778
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:26,190
你們能趕緊舔臉嗎
Would you just lick faces already?

1779
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,090
這可能嗎
Is it possible?

1780
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:29,400
不
No.

1781
01:36:29,670 --> 01:36:31,660
完全不可能
No, it's utterly impossible.

1782
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:34,440
但我想這是真的
But I guess it's true.

1783
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:39,940
我愛你  特倫特
I love you, Trent.

1784
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:44,300
我一直愛著你
I've always loved you.

1785
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:47,800
我愛了你一輩子了
I've loved you forever.

1786
01:36:54,990 --> 01:36:55,720
終于
Finally.

1787
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:14,610
謝謝你  麥克斯
Thank you, Max.

1788
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:16,320
還有莫莉
And Molly.

1789
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,790
還有貝利  還有大狗
And Bailey, and Big Dog.

1790
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,420
那些都是我
Those are all me.

1791
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:25,730
是啊
Yeah.

1792
01:37:30,150 --> 01:37:31,890
我照伊森說的做了
I did what Ethan asked.

1793
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:34,830
{\an8}家書
克拉里蒂·瓊

1794
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,750
我照顧CJ  讓她過上好日子
I watched after CJ so that she would have a good life,

1795
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:37,030
有個好家庭
with a good pack.

1796
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:39,580
看起來很棒
It looks great.

1797
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:42,870
想聽聽我寫的關于你的歌嗎  麥克斯
You want to hear a song I wrote about you, Max?

1798
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:46,050
CJ叫我的名字  我永遠都聽不厭
I never got tired of hearing CJ say my name.

1799
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,310
