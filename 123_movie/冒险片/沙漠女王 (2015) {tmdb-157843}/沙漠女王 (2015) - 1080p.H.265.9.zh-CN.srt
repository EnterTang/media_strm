00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,580
可后来我意识到 我犯了多大的错
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong

716
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,370
我长大了
And I grew strong

学会了面对孤独
And I learned how to get along

718

我走进你 用我悲伤的眼神
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face

720
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,050
我应该对准我的 钟表
I should have changed that stupid lock

721
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,140
让你留下你的钥匙
And made you leave your key

722
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,100
如果我知道 你将会回来
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

我没有摔倒
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart

739

我要捡起我 破碎的心
Just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart

740

我付出很多的夜晚 来感觉我自己的存在
And I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself

你不会感到自由
So you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
