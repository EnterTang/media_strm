1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:12,569
翻譯:桌面王(Netpilot)

2
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,800
沙漠女王

3
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:48,357
第一次世界大戰加速了統治中東
長達五個世紀的土耳其帝國的滅亡

4
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:52,911
殖民地遭到瓜分...

5
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:56,823
自付的土耳其帝國最終不存在了
Assuming the Ottoman Empire finally becomes defunct,

6
00:02:56,825 --> 00:03:00,597
俄國會取得達達尼爾海峽，與他們非常接近
Russia would get the Dardanelles, the portion closest to them,

7
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,037
至於意大利，在大陸群島上
and the Italians, the islands of mainland.

8
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,025
- 那法國沒意見嗎？ - 法國對什麼事情都有意見
- The French had no problem with that? - The French have problems with everything.

9
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:11,175
那是他們的天性
That's their nature.

10
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:14,154
多大的份額？
And the big portions?

11
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:18,197
一旦控制了敘利亞和黎巴嫩，之後就容易多了
Once I conceeded the control over Syria and Lebanon to them it got easier.

12
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:21,444
讓我們聽聽你的想法
Let us read your mind.

13
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:24,913
丘吉爾先生，你真的想讓黎巴嫩加入大英帝國嗎？
Mr Churchill, do you really want Lebanon for the British Empire?

14
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:29,539
上千年來的混亂局面，沒人能理順
It's a mess grown in a 1,000 years that no one will ever disentangle.

15
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,320
敘利亞會造成很大的問題
Syria might pose a bigger problem.

16
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:37,549
遜尼派教徒， 什葉派教徒， 德魯士，基督教徒都相互敵對
Sunni, Shiite, Alawis, Druze, Christian, all at each other's throats.

17
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,996
北方還有庫爾德人，讓法國去對付庫爾德人
And up North, the Kurds. Let the French deal with the Kurds.

18
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:44,993
或者，讓法國試著去對付庫爾德人
Or let the French try to deal with the Kurds.

19
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:46,481
他們會失敗的
And let them fail.

20
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:49,453
我知道你這些情報是從哪裡來的
I know where all our intelligence comes from.

21
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:56,110
你的意思是說...從一個女人那裡？
Are you trying to say... from the woman?

22
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,167
從那個女人那裡？
From that woman?

23
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:02,625
喝了雞尾酒後的小錯誤
Petty rivalries only after cocktails.

24
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,931
現在，對於我們
Now, to us.

25
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:11,503
戰區B，是我們的控制範圍
Zone B: our area of influence.

26
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:14,890
我經過和法國，巴格達，巴士拉，科威特較量
I wrestle from the French Baghdad, Bazra, Kuwait.

27
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:18,531
這些現在都由我們直接控制了
This will now be under our direct control.

28
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:21,128
那麼我們如何定義邊界呢？
And how do we delineate the borders?

29
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,809
- 那是早晚的事 - 不
- That we'll formalize later. - No.

30
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:27,522
現在就是時候了，必須是
This is the moment. It has to be now.

31
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:36,396
我們的問題在這兒，南部
Our issues start down here, in the South.

32
00:04:36,398 --> 00:04:39,068
現在還是模糊的紅色虛線
Now it's just a vague red dotted line.

33
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,510
- 沙特阿拉伯是我們的麻煩 - 十足的惡棍
- We have a problem with Ibn Saud. - The scoundrel.

34
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:43,791
事實上，我們有兩個問題
In fact we have two problems.

35
00:04:43,793 --> 00:04:47,288
首先，他想讓阿拉伯半島分離成為他的獨立國家
Firstly, he wants the whole Arabia as a separate country for himself.

36
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,742
混蛋
The bastard.

37
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:53,551
其次，他希望邊界不那麼明確
And secondly, he wants a flexible border.

38
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:56,896
他的一個部族，夏天要去北方放牧
One of his tribes is moving North for the summer pastures.

39
00:04:56,898 --> 00:05:00,275
那裡什麼都沒有，只有沙漠
There are no bloody pastures. There's only sand.

40
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:02,282
他希望邊界...
And he wants a border...

41
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:04,850
主要是那些遊牧民族，不是武裝自衛隊
according to the movement of people, not territorial.

42
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:07,206
中東不好搞定啊
East is not fly.

43
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,755
誰最瞭解這些部族？
Who knows best about tribes?

44
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:13,828
血統，成員情況，對抗行為
Lineages, affiliations, rivalries.

45
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,023
誰最瞭解貝都因人？
Who knows best about Bedouin tribes?

46
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:20,755
誰能統治他們？
And who is going to rule over all this?

47
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:24,472
我們在討論未來的國王
We are talking to potential future kings.

48
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:28,787
誰認識志願者？ 誰最瞭解？
Who knows the candidates? Who knows them best?

49
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:33,259
那個女人，格特魯德
The woman. Gertrude.

50
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,296
格特魯德是誰？
Gertrude who?

51
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,782
- 格特魯德 貝爾 - 一個小蕩婦
- Gertrude Bell. - A silly bitch.

52
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:44,781
總是喋喋不休的，自付的，熱情的
It's a chattering windbag of conceited, gushing,

53
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:46,939
胸大的女人
heavychested manwoman,

54
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:51,193
到處遊走的，四處閒逛的傢伙
a globetrotting, rumpwagging, blethering ass.

55
00:05:56,953 --> 00:05:58,498
格特魯德
Gertrude.

56
00:05:58,499 --> 00:05:59,550
十二年前

57
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,239
- 格特魯德 貝爾，看著我 - 媽媽，不要
- Gertrude, look at me. - Mother, don't.

58
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:03,451
- 什麼？ - 不要告訴我這些禮儀
- What? - Don't tell me how to behave.

59
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:05,026
我必須這樣做
I'm afraid I'm going to, anyway.

60
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:09,337
- 你要笑出來 - 是的，媽媽
- You will smile. - Yes, mother.

61
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:13,888
你不要因為你的聰明才智嚇壞年輕男人
You will not scare the young men with your intelligence.

62
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,707
我怎麼能做到呢？我又不能沉默不語
How do I do that? I cannot play dumb.

63
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,794
只是...聽聽他們說話，微笑就行了
Just... listen to what they have to say and smile.

64
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,621
那太難了
That will be hard.

65
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:24,190
- 格特魯德... - 我喜歡它
- Gertrude... - I love it.

66
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,155
我喜歡它
I love it.

67
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:31,359
我喜歡它
I love it.

68
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,714
- 之後呢？ - 你的意思是在獅子後面？
- And then? - You mean after the lion?

69
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:52,175
- 是的 - 然後我開槍射殺了大象
- Yes. - Then I shot an elephant.

70
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:55,449
這些都發生在蘇丹南部？
And all of this was in the South Sudan?

71
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:58,263
不，我的打獵場所改在了肯尼亞
No, my hunting party had moved to Kenya by then.

72
00:06:58,265 --> 00:07:00,597
天那，很好的旅行路線！
God, what that a safari!

73
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:04,734
我猜你不僅僅射殺了大象
I would guess you didn't shoot just one elephant.

74
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:11,305
首先是犀牛，然後是獅子還有兩隻大象
First a rhino, then a lion, and then two elephant bulls.

75
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:15,160
那麼非洲還有大象嗎？
Are there any elephants left in Africa?

76
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:18,607
你是什麼意思呢，女士？
You meaning what, young lady?

77
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:26,020
格特魯德...
Gertrude...

78
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:28,834
我很想和你出去
I would love to elope with you.

79
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,234
去哪兒？ 巴黎，印度？
Where to? Paris, India?

80
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:35,053
埃及？
The pyramids?

81
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,321
外面有個穀倉
Out there, there is a barn.

82
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:42,696
你的意思是在乾草上？
You mean hay?

83
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:47,587
我們離開幾分鐘沒人會注意到的
Nobody would notice if we left for a few minutes.

84
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:51,452
你的意思是出去通姦
You mean for fornication. Straightforward.

85
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:52,750
是的
Absolutely.

86
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:56,770
- 就像是在地裡的牲口那樣？ - 是的
- Like the cattle in the field? - Absolutely.

87
00:07:57,714 --> 00:08:01,181
阿諾德 朗西，我都不瞭解你
Arnold Runcie, I barely know you.

88
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:05,099
- 但你看起來像頭牛一樣 - 是的
- But you seem to like cows. - Absolutely.

89
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:07,541
你有多少女人？
How many do you have?

90
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:12,189
在紐卡斯爾有大約800人
Near Newcastle I have 800 Herefordshire.

91
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:16,733
北邊，蘇格蘭，大約2000
Up North, in Scotland, 2,000.

92
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:20,950
- 愛神？ - 愛神，是的
- Angus? - Angus. Yes.

93
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:23,397
阿拉丁愛神啊
Black Angus.

94
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:42,484
貝爾小姐，感謝你的表揚
Miss Bell, thank you for the honor.

95
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:45,581
我在這兒，海文斯特先生
Over here, Mr. Havenhurst.

96
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,445
在你左邊呢
Over here to your left.

97
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,544
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

98
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:51,875
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

99
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:55,983
我的天啊！
Dear God!

100
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:59,527
還不如地震算了
Send me an earthquake, please.

101
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:19,313
我受不了了
I can't take it.

102
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:22,289
我感覺太受束縛了
I feel so domesticated.

103
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,795
- 簡直令人窒息  - 格特魯德，我能說什麼呢？
- It's stifling to me. - Gertrude, what am I suppoed to say?

104
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:30,401
我要說。我們不能讓你去牛津
I can say it. We should never have allowed you to go to Oxford.

105
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:32,112
但是，親愛的，她是僅有的四個女人之一
But dear, she's one of only four women

106
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,174
學習歷史，並且拿到了最高的學位
to study history and graduate with the highest honors.

107
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:38,641
一個年輕的出自豪門的未婚女子，不應該...
A young unmarried woman from a good family should not...

108
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:40,933
不應該在沒有人陪伴的情況下隨便出門
Should not be allowed out on the streets without a chaperon.

109
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,182
- 格特魯德，你能坐下嗎？  - 不，我不想坐著
- Gertrude, would you please sit down? - No, I don't want to sit down.

110
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:48,882
親愛的，我是一直支持你的
Darling, I have always supported you.

111
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:51,581
我看著你長大的
I watched you climb sharp, high rocks.

112
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:55,429
我們不要忘記，你奶奶由於你的任性離開了人世
Let us not forget the string of nannies who quit because of your willfulness.

113
00:09:55,873 --> 00:09:57,858
那又怎樣
Well, so what.

114
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,397
你還記得那時候，你爬到公園裡的樹上嗎？
Do you remember that time when you climbed that tall tree in the park?

115
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,552
你的背後帶著個巨大的罩子
And you had a very large lamp shade on your back.

116
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,155
是的，我記得
Yes, I remember that.

117
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:09,846
你只有五歲，你都已經能閱讀
You were only 5, you were already reading voraciously.

118
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:13,513
有人給你的里昂納多 達芬奇速寫集了
Somebody stupidly showed you Leonardo da Vinci's sketchbook.

119
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:17,929
- 我還記得帶降落傘的傢伙 - 誰會需要降落傘呢？
- I remember the one with the parachute. - Who ever would need a parachute?

120
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,004
所有人多需要降落傘
Everyone. Everyone needs a parachute.

121
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:25,061
這可比你腳崴了更讓我擔心
It probably hurt me more than you when you broke your ankle.

122
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,273
我不要想那些事情了，讓我今天感到很難過
I don't like to think about it, it hurts me even today.

123
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,802
讓我出去吧
Get me out of here, please.

124
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:35,408
求你們了，讓我出去吧！
Please, please, get me out of here!

125
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,848
印度，阿拉伯，任何地方，求你們了！
India, Arabia, anywhere. Please !

126
00:10:48,803 --> 00:10:50,194
你知道...
You know...

127
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:55,640
你不在我們身邊怎麼都會讓我擔心的
However how much it hurts me when you're not around,

128
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:59,888
我們決定讓你出去
we are going to have to get you out of here.

129
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:01,950
去哪兒？
Where?

130
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:05,549
德黑蘭如何？
What about Tehran?

131
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:08,021
大使館
The embassy.

132
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,220
一個月後

133
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,976
我要來介紹格特魯德小姐
I'm going to introduce Gertrude now.

134
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:20,846
是時候了。把你的杯子給我一下？ 謝謝

大家過來，謝謝

138
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:36,412
我很高興給大家介紹格特魯德 洛西恩 貝爾小姐
I'd like to introduce Gertrude Lowthian Bell to you.

139
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:39,764
她是一顆閃耀的新星
She is a brilliant young scholar.

140
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:43,479
她是我的外甥女
And I am blessed to call her my niece.

141
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:47,361
她實際上是我夫人瑪麗的妹妹的女兒
She is actually the daughter of my wife Mary's sister.

142
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:50,101
我們愛她
And we love her.

143
00:11:50,103 --> 00:11:55,685
我確信，你會讓她很我們在一起非常開心的
And I'm sure you will make her stay with us a wonderful experience.

144
00:11:56,784 --> 00:12:00,103
言歸正傳，我的妻子
As to the return of my dear wife,

145
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:03,286
我的孩子，我放蕩的生活結束了
boys, the wildlife is over.

146
00:12:05,185 --> 00:12:08,210
再也不允許騎馬進入餐廳
No more riding on horseback into our dining room.

147
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:13,766
再也不允許在我們整齊的草坪上酗酒
No more drunken orgies on our well-groomed British lawn.

148
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,522
再也不允許拯救那些陷入困境的少女
No more rescues of damsels in distress.

149
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:22,325
再也不允許在公眾場合
And no more public display

150
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:27,406
對維多利亞女王不敬
of the wildest irreverance towards our beloved Queen Victoria.

151
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:31,402
我認為我們應該花些時間
Who, I think, needs to spend time here

152
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:37,142
引導她從過分拘謹的帝國生活中走出來
to lean her from her grand design of a prudish empire.

153
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:42,963
敬大英帝國！
To the British Empire!

154
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:45,365
敬伊朗
And to Persia.

155
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:50,286
一個具有5000年歷史的國家
The country of 5,000 years of poetry.

156
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,986
為什麼我的酒杯空了？
Why is my glass empty?

157
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:55,052
我的香檳呢？
Where is the champagne?

158
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:15,584
這裡的感覺...我無法相信
The sense... I can't believe it.

159
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,890
- 還有小鳥 - 南丁格爾
- And birds. - Nightingale.

160
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:24,919
當我夜裡抱著枕頭哭泣的時候，她總讓我很高興
When I cry at night into my pillow, she always makes me feel happy.

161
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:28,361
她？ 我覺得只有男人才唱歌
She? I think it's only the males who sing.

162
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:32,278
- 別寵壞它 - 我很抱歉，弗洛倫斯...
- Don't spoil it. - I'm sorry, Flo...

163
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:34,782
你好
Hello.

164
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:39,113
我是亨利 卡多根
I'm Henry Cadogan.

165
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:41,281
- 我是... - 亨利是大使的秘書
- I am... - Henry is the secretary of the Embassy.

166
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:45,398
事實上，我是他的第三個秘書
Actually, I'm only the third secretary.

167
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,902
貝爾小姐，我很高興你能來女王統治下的大使館
Ms. Bell, I welcome you to the embassy of Her Majesty the Queen.

168
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:52,683
過分拘謹的陛下
A prudish majesty.

169
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:57,469
我被指派做為你的助理

170
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,127
來招待你，所以...

如果你有任何需求，請來找我
If there's anything you need at all, please let me know.

172
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:06,779
我會的

173
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:13,805
亨利
Henry.

174
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:16,429
亨利，表演一下你的戲法
Henry, please show us your trick shots.

175
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,374
弗洛倫斯，桌子有人在用啊
Florence, the table is not even free.

176
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,730
求你了
Please.

177
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,449
不，我不是馬戲團的表演者
No, I'm not a circus performer.

178
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,228
他有兩個不可思議的戲法
It has two unbelievable trick shots.

179
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:34,083
表演一下「月球軌道」
Show us your "Orbit the Moon".

180
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:36,533
弗洛倫斯，這裡是大使館啊
Florence, it's embarrassing.

181
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:40,552
- 你的第二個戲法是什麼？ - 是「青蛙跳」
- What's your second trick shot? - The "Frog Leap".

182
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,852
亨利，表演一下撲克牌戲法
Henry, show us your card trick.

183
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:45,979
他撲克牌戲法棒極了
He has the greatest of card trick.

184
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:48,282
- 真的嗎？ - 求你了
- Really? - Please.

185
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:51,596
弗洛倫斯，這是個愚蠢的戲法，不！
Florence, it's a silly trick. No!

186
00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:00,412
走吧
Come, come.

187
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:10,253
貝爾小姐，我可以建議把你住所的床
Ms. Bell, may I suggest at the residency,

188
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:12,706
放在屋頂上，面對天空嗎
you put your bed out on the roof under the sky.

189
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:17,157
我很喜歡夜裡的星星
I do love the stars at night.

190
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,999
但是，我還要給你掛上蚊帳
Although I'll have to put out the mosquito netting for you.

191
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,782
蚊子太可怕了
The mosquitoes are awful.

192
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:25,646
拉塞爾斯小姐，我們打擾到你了嗎？
Mrs. Lascelles, are we not boring you?

193
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:26,647
沒有
No.

194
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,301
哦，不，沒有
Oh, no. No, no, no.

195
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,979
弗洛倫斯，弗洛倫斯，過來一下好嗎？
Florence. Florence, will you please come over?

196
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:33,985
現在？
Now?

197
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:37,348
新來的意大利大使有禮物給你
The new Italian ambassador has a present for you.

198
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,736
- 亨利，我一會兒回來 - 亨利
- Henry, I should come right back. - Hurray.

199
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:57,104
這裡就像是「野獸花園」
It's like "The Beast's Garden".

200
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:05,230
這裡有花，感覺像是一個完美的夢魘
It's a perfect nightmare of flowers and sens.

201
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,835
卡多根先生，你能告訴我上面的碑文寫的是什麼嗎？
Mr. Cadogan, do you by any chance know what this inscription says?

202
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:23,998
好的
Yes.

203
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:27,598
是波斯語
It's in Farsi.

204
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:30,021
來自中世紀
But a medieval form of it.

205
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:32,934
你能讀一下嗎？
Can you read it?

206
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,321
「我播種的智慧的種子」
"With them, the seed of wisdom did I sow

207
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:46,681
「我親手勞動栽培它」
"and with my own hand labour'd it to grow."

208
00:16:46,781 --> 00:16:48,719
「這是我得到的所有收貨」
"And this was all the harvest that I reap'd

209
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:50,967
「我喜歡水還有風」
"I came like water and like wind I go."

210
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:54,827
貝爾小姐，你精通詩歌？
Miss Bell, you know poetry?

211
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:59,256
- 你知道奧瑪 開陽嗎 - 是的，知道
- You know Omar Khayyam. - Yes.

212
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,756
我想學習他的語言

213
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:10,015
<i>親愛的媽媽</i>
<i>Mother dearest,</i>

214
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:13,076
<i>我今天有機會用外交郵包</i>
<i>I'm using the opportunity to send you this</i>

215
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:14,777
<i>給你發送這封信</i>
<i>With today's diplomatic pouch.</i>

216
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:18,846
<i>我度過了很珍貴的第一周，而且還學習了一些波斯語</i>
<i>My first week has been most precious and I have started to learn Farsi</i>

217
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:21,532
<i>可以閱讀一些詩句</i>
<i>in order to read the poets in their original.</i>

218
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:27,619
<i>在大使館工作的卡多根先生，幫助了我很多</i>
<i>Mr. Cadogan, who works at the embassy, is very helpful in this.</i>

219
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:31,633
<i>他很彬彬有禮，聰明也很博學</i>
<i>He is agreeable, intelligent, well-read,</i>

220
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:34,453
<i>照看我們，弗洛倫斯和我，他很擅長</i>
<i>looking after us, Florence and me, as his special property.</i>

221
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,707
<i>我喜歡他</i>
<i>I like him.</i>

222
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,687
<i>他邀請我們今天和他一起騎馬</i>
<i>He's invited us to ride with him today."</i>

223
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:48,978
- 但是，亨利，你不能騎馬 - 我可以的
- But Henry, you can't ride. - Yes, I can.

224
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,353
掉下來怎麼辦？
What if you fall?

225
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:53,280
- 那都是巧合 - 你會受傷的
- It happens to the best. - You will get hurt.

226
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,681
我不喜歡騎馬

227
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:58,245
- 你為什麼不一起來？ - 我害怕騎馬
- Why don't you join us? - I'm afraid of horses.

228
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:02,224
再見
Bye.

229
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:39,114
貝爾小姐，這裡是我最喜歡的地方
Miss Bell, this is my favorite place in all of the countryside.

230
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,659
冬季過後，水位上漲的非常高
After the winter, when the water level is very high,

231
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:46,598
牧羊人游泳過來為了夏天的牧草
and the shepherds swim their flocks down here for the summer pasture.

232
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:51,059
有時候，有上千隻綿羊
Sometimes, a thousand of sheep.

233
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:55,550
牧羊人在羊群中間游來游去
And the shepherds swim among them on these inflated goat skins.

234
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:57,986
- 是的，我以前見過 - 是嗎？
- Yes, I've seen that. - Have you?

235
00:18:57,988 --> 00:18:59,552
在巴爾倫城
In Babylonian reliefs.

236
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,053
他們這樣做有4000年歷史了
They were doing it 4,000 years ago.

237
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,081
- 他們至今還這樣做 - 非常特別
- They still do. - It's extraordinary.

238
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:11,364
有時候我還爬到那裡
Sometimes I go up there.

239
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,832
我是相當不錯的爬山愛好者
I'm a fairly good mountain climber,

240
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,100
但是你是怎麼上去的呢？
but how for God's sake do you get up there?

241
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:20,575
我告訴你，這很容易的
I must confess it's pretty easy.

242
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:24,586
你繞道後面，然後爬上去
You walk around the back and go up.

243
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:27,754
為什麼？
Why?

244
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,330
為什麼你去那裡呢？
Why do you go there?

245
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,754
我去是因為我很孤獨
I go when I'm lonely.

246
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:42,862
我很孤獨
I get very lonely.

247
00:19:59,234 --> 00:20:00,421
格特魯德
Gertrude.

248
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:03,873
- 有事嗎？ - 一封信
- Yes? - A letter.

249
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:07,002
- 我的信？- 不，是給亨利的
- A letter for me? - No, for Henry.

250
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,692
- 你的意思是給卡多根先生的？ - 是的，亨利
- You mean Mr. Cadogan? - Yes, Henry.

251
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:14,320
你能把信給他嗎？
Could you please hand him this letter?

252
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:16,740
你為什麼不自己給他？
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

253
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:19,214
我不能
I cannot.

254
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:20,899
為什麼不能呢？
Why can't you?

255
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,660
格特魯德，女人和女人之間的事情，你不能告訴任何人？
Gertrude, from woman to woman, you won't say anything?

256
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:29,834
- 我不會說 - 不和任何人說
- No, I won't. - To no one?

257
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:33,056
甚至靈魂，我保證
Not a soul. I promise.

258
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:41,826
自從去年，我的意思是一年，兩個月，11天...
Ever since last year. I mean since one year, two months and 11 days...

259
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,981
什麼？
What?

260
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:46,106
我不得不說...
I have had...

261
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:48,308
我愛上亨利了
a passion for Henry.

262
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:52,279
他今天說什麼了嗎？ 他提及到我嗎？
What did he say to you today? Did he mention me today?

263
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:57,429
沒有，我們只是談論起牧羊人
No, we just talked about shepherds.

264
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:01,820
你為什麼不自己把信給卡多根先生呢？
Why can't you give Mr. Cadogan your letter?

265
00:21:01,822 --> 00:21:03,335
我就是不能
I just can't.

266
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:06,972
我給他信的話，會導致很多流言蜚語的
And I sending him letters by mail might cause gossip upon its arrival.

267
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,276
信？
Letters?

268
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:10,723
我給他寫了202封信了
I wrote him 202.

269
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,319
太可怕了
It's terrible.

270
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:18,241
我不能去送
I can't send them.

271
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,576
親愛的弗洛倫斯
Sweet Florence, my darling.

272
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:27,491
你知道，我會為你做一切事情的
You know I'd do anything for you.

273
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:31,932
但是我不能傷害你的心
But I cannot fight the battles of your heart.

274
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,747
<i>親愛的父親</i>
<i>Father dearest,</i>

275
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,990
<i>我不知道從哪裡說起</i>
<i>I do not know where to begin.</i>

276
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:03,721
<i>東方就像是一個夢</i>
<i>The Orient is like a prolonged dream.</i>

277
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:09,217
<i>嬸嬸把我各個方面照顧的都非常好</i>
<i>I am being taken care of wonderfully by Auntie, and for all the rest</i>

278
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:12,329
<i>卡多根先生是個很不錯的嚮導和助理</i>
<i>Mr. Cadogan is a fine guide and guardian.</i>

279
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:20,005
<i>他照顧弗洛倫斯和我</i>
<i>He takes care of Florence and me.</i>

280
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,813
<i>他帶我們去看市場上有意思的東西</i>
<i>He shows us lovely things from the bazaars.</i>

281
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,762
<i>我們需要他，他就會出現</i>
<i>He's always there when we want him.</i>

282
00:22:25,764 --> 00:22:27,612
<i>我們不需要他就會離開</i>
<i>And never when we don't.</i>

283
00:22:28,185 --> 00:22:29,479
快點
Hurry.

284
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:43,527
謝謝你帶我們來這裡
Yes. Thank you for bringing us.

285
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:48,716
你看，他們真的吃羊頭
You see, they really eat the heads here.

286
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:50,261
是啊？
Do they?

287
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:52,516
- 好吃嗎？ - 是的
- This is a delicacy? - Yes.

288
00:22:59,131 --> 00:23:00,952
顏色很不錯啊！
Such lovely colors!

289
00:23:01,553 --> 00:23:03,584
- 是的 - 太美了
- Yes. - They are so pretty.

290
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:06,058
這是紅辣椒，你可以嘗嘗
This is paprika. You can try it.

291
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:07,713
可以嗎？
Can I?

292
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,228
「謝謝」怎麼說？
How to say "Thank you".

293
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,053
你喜歡嗎，弗洛倫斯？
Do you love it, Florence?

294
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:34,514
貝爾小姐
Miss Bell.

295
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:38,587
我沒走，希望能看見你
I stayed up, hoping I would see you.

296
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:41,263
我不是來打檯球的
I didn't come to play billiards.

297
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,545
那你來幹什麼？
Why did you come?

298
00:23:46,914 --> 00:23:49,543
我是來看你撲克牌戲法的
I came for your card trick.

299
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:51,931
我明白了
I see.

300
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:56,136
撲克牌戲法
Card trick it is.

301
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:59,194
你走到這邊來
You have to come over here.

302
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:08,620
你看見了，牌是洗過的
As you can see, the deck is already shuffled.

303
00:24:09,454 --> 00:24:13,162
紅色和黑色的牌是隨機擺放的
The red cards and the black cards are placed at random.

304
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:19,627
這個戲法很凶險的
This trick is fiendish.

305
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:27,494
從現在開始，我就不會再碰這些牌了
From this point on, I will not touch the cards.

306
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:31,029
你來做下面的事情
You'll do everything.

307
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:32,919
我？
Me?

308
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,144
我要給你下一個魔咒
I'm going to cast a spell over you.

309
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:44,274
在魔咒下，不看牌
And under this spell, without looking,

310
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:50,220
你就能決定牌是紅色的還是黑色的
you'll be able to determine if the card is red or if it is black.

311
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:52,512
不看牌？
Without looking at the cards?

312
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,912
那不可能
That's impossible.

313
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:59,462
根據機會率
According to the laws of probability.

314
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:02,950
在我的魔咒下...
Under my spell...

315
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,129
不存在規律
the laws do not exist.

316
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,910
你可以開始了
You may begin.

317
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:17,676
不要翻過來
Do not turn it over.

318
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:19,575
我沒有
I'm not.

319
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:21,969
是什麼顏色？
What color is it?

320
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:27,594
黑色
Black.

321
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,394
黑色
Black.

322
00:25:33,758 --> 00:25:34,837
紅色
Red.

323
00:25:36,546 --> 00:25:37,628
黑色
Black.

324
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,067
紅色
Red.

325
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:44,422
黑色，黑色
Black. Black.

326
00:25:44,424 --> 00:25:47,137
紅色，紅色，紅色
Red. Red. Red.

327
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:00,594
瞧
Voila.

328
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:07,989
卡多根先生，當你把它們翻過來的時候
Mr. Cadogan, you did touch the cards again.

329
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:09,533
你又碰這些牌了
When you turned them over.

330
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:16,120
格特魯德，你非常聰明
Gertrude, you're very smart.

331
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:20,119
你是唯一注意到這個細節的人
You're the only one who's ever noticed that.

332
00:26:22,934 --> 00:26:25,882
你剛才叫我「格特魯德」，亨利？
Did you just call me "Gertrude", Henry?

333
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:28,730
是的
Yes, I did.

334
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,286
你剛才叫我亨利？
And did you just call me Henry?

335
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,645
隔牆有耳
The walls have ears.

336
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:43,480
戲法是什麼原理？
How does the trick really work?

337
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:50,708
我不打算告訴你
I'm not going to tell you.

338
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,966
但是你已經很接近了
But you're very close.

339
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:56,791
是嗎？
Am I?

340
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:33,976
我喜歡這裡的鳥
I love the birds here.

341
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:39,842
我來這裡想看看這些鳥
I come here for the birds.

342
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,259
這裡是寂靜之塔
This is the Tower of Silence.

343
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:08,871
格特魯德，你確定要爬上去嗎？
Gertrude, you're sure you wish to climb all the way up?

344
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,188
是的，我確定
Yes, I'm sure.

345
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,928
是的
Yes.

346
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,006
這可能有骨頭
There may be bones.

347
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:19,286
也許有頭顱
Maybe skulls.

348
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,790
也許還有禿鷹
Maybe vultures.

349
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:36,442
我們會激怒禿鷹嗎？
What if we anger the vultures?

350
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:41,623
它們也許聽見我們的聲音飛走了
They've probably heard us and flown away.

351
00:29:43,305 --> 00:29:44,379
就像我告訴你的
As I told you,

352
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,022
瑣羅亞斯德教教徒把屍體放在這裡留給禿鷹
this is what the Zoroastrians leave their dead to the vultures.

353
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:51,514
他們認為這樣很神聖
They considered them sacred.

354
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,407
你害怕嗎？
You're scared?

355
00:30:07,048 --> 00:30:08,693
我不怕
I'm not afraid.

356
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:22,671
格特魯德 洛西恩 貝爾
Gertrude Lowthian Bell.

357
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:25,415
我想吻你
I wish to kiss you.

358
00:30:42,238 --> 00:30:44,236
也許不應該在這裡做
Maybe we shouldn't do it here.

359
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,492
快跑
Run. Come on.

360
00:32:21,547 --> 00:32:23,819
弗洛倫斯，別哭泣了
Florence, stop that moody brooding.

361
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:25,981
- 父親 - 弗蘭克
- Father... - Frank.

362
00:32:25,983 --> 00:32:28,738
- 別總叫我 - 她是個孩子
- Don't Frank me. - She's a girl.

363
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,301
我吃飯的時候不允許哭泣
My dinner table is a no cry zone.

364
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,008
我很抱歉給你生了個女兒，很顯然你想要個男孩
I'm sorry I gave birth to a daughter. You wanted a boy, obviously.

365
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,081
當然不是了！
Absolutely not!

366
00:32:36,082 --> 00:32:38,871
你只生了一個，我有些介意
You could've born me a dromedary, and I would have minded.

367
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:43,214
看，親愛的
Now look, darling.

368
00:32:43,216 --> 00:32:45,708
眼淚也有好的一面
There is a good side about tears.

369
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:49,180
如果你把眼淚都哭出來，你的小便就會減少了
If you cry them out, you need to pee much less.

370
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,509
讓我們來抽根雪茄吧
Let's smoke a cigar together.

371
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,182
- 麵包 - 是的
- Bread. - Yeah.

372
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:11,788
一片麵包
A piece of bread.

373
00:33:13,187 --> 00:33:15,231
一條麵包
A loaf of bread.

374
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:20,449
阿拉伯紅酒，一瓶紅酒
Sharab wine. A flask of wine.

375
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,027
還有...
And so...

376
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:25,971
你做的很好
You're doing so well.

377
00:33:25,973 --> 00:33:27,777
- 是嗎？ - 是的
- I am? - Yes.

378
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:35,071
「一條麵包，在樹下，一瓶紅酒，一本詩集」
"A loaf of bread beneath the bough. A flask of wine, a book of verse.

379
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:40,753
「你在我旁邊在荒野裡唱歌」
"And Thou beside me singing in the wilderness.

380
00:33:40,906 --> 00:33:45,209
「荒野現在是天堂」
"And wilderness is paradise enow."

381
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:49,040
還要
More.

382
00:33:50,437 --> 00:33:51,871
看這句詩
Look at this verse.

383
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,587
「鳥兒有時間但很有限」
"The bird of time has but a little way.

384
00:33:58,864 --> 00:34:00,544
「去飛翔」
"To fly."

385
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,851
- 偉大的亞歷山大  - 是的
- Alexander the Great. - Yeah.

386
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:23,700
有2200年歷史了
That's 2,200 years looking at you.

387
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:28,084
- 這個給我的？ - 不
- It is for me? - No.

388
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,013
給你一半
Only half.

389
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,681
有個銀匠把這個分成了兩半
I had a silversmith tie it in two.

390
00:34:37,758 --> 00:34:40,897
所以一半給你，另一半是我的
So half is for you and half is for me.

391
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,219
不管你在世界什麼地方
Wherever you are in the world,

392
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,105
不管我在哪裡
and wherever I might be,

393
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,742
這個證明我們屬於對方
this is proof that we belong to each other.

394
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:05,685
如果我們中的一個死了，之後另一個人要保留完整的硬幣
And if one of us dies, then the other keeps the whole coin.

395
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,835
亨利
Henry.

396
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,485
格特魯德 洛西恩 貝爾
Gertrude Lowthian Bell,

397
00:35:22,148 --> 00:35:23,903
你願意嫁給我嗎？
will you marry me?

398
00:35:26,696 --> 00:35:28,691
我沒聽錯吧？
Did I hear you correctly?

399
00:35:29,881 --> 00:35:32,669
是的，嫁給我，你願意嫁給我嗎？
Yes, marry me. Will you marry me ?

400
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,842
你不應該下跪嗎？
Shouldn't you get down on your knees?

401
00:35:38,448 --> 00:35:39,887
哦，不
Oh, no.

402
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:44,699
我做錯了
I did it wrong.

403
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,777
- 是的 - 同意了？
- Yes. - Yes?

404
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:58,127
好的，你願意嫁給我嗎？
Alright, will you marry me?

405
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:01,265
我願意
I will.

406
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:24,695
亨利？
Henry?

407
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:29,248
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

408
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:37,632
你是怎麼繞過衛兵通過梯子來到這裡的？
How did you pass the security guards with a ladder?

409
00:36:41,637 --> 00:36:45,198
我知道如何做生命中最重要的事情
I know how to do all the most important things in life.

410
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:48,167
但是你會掉下去的
But you could've fallen into your daddy.

411
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:59,495
這很重要，我解決了一個特別特殊的秘密
It was very important that I solve a particular mystery.

412
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:01,461
什麼秘密？
What mystery?

413
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:04,699
你看...
Well, you see...

414
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,295
我喜歡你的笑容
I love your smile.

415
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:12,794
但是很多男人墜入愛河都是因為女人的笑容
But many men in love with a woman's smile

416
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:17,252
犯了錯誤就娶了女孩兒
have made the mistake of marrying the whole girl.

417
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:29,879
這裡就有個女孩兒
Here's the whole girl.

418
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:08,918
我很奇怪，為什麼我父親還沒有回答我
I wonder why my father hasn't answered me.

419
00:38:09,907 --> 00:38:11,888
別擔心，總是會有延遲的
Don't worry, there's always a delay

420
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,293
因為郵件在倫敦需要在外交部分類
because the mail needs to be sorted in the foreign office in London.

421
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,737
兩天前我發了電報
Two days ago I sent a telegram.

422
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:20,181
你發了電報？
You sent a telegram?

423
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:21,503
從大使館？
From the embassy?

424
00:38:21,505 --> 00:38:24,596
- 那麼...所有人都知道我們的事情了？ - 不
- So... everyone knows about us? - No.

425
00:38:24,598 --> 00:38:27,973
不是的，我只是說，「你回答我了嗎？」
No, I only said: "Have you sent an answer?"

426
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,196
我什麼都沒收到
And I've heard nothing.

427
00:38:31,198 --> 00:38:33,378
什麼回答也沒有
Nothing from him.

428
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:36,640
我很擔心
I'm worried.

429
00:39:00,202 --> 00:39:02,277
我能幫你什麼？
Can I help you?

430
00:39:04,223 --> 00:39:08,089
急件，我沒有電報
From dispatch. I don't have a telegram.

431
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:11,716
但是我注意到郵遞員有給你的封信
But I noticed that the mailwoman had this letter for you.

432
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,828
我知道你在等
I knew you were waiting.

433
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,805
我在這聽你使喚
I'm always here for you.

434
00:39:18,661 --> 00:39:19,754
我要...
I would...

435
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,831
- 我要...- 要怎樣？
- I would... - Would what?

436
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:27,094
我要把一切獻給像你這樣的女人
I would give my life for a woman like you.

437
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:45,256
我要回家，我要和我父親談談
I shall return home, I shall speak to my father.

438
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:59,270
愛是無辜的，別走
Love is lawless. Don't go.

439
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,391
他的證書沒什麼用
His credentials are not impressive.

440
00:41:26,393 --> 00:41:28,276
我不管這些
I don't care.

441
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:31,313
你知道一個小外交官能掙多少錢啊？
Do you have any idea how little the junior diplomat earns?

442
00:41:31,315 --> 00:41:34,914
我可以住帳篷的 - 一個帳篷！ - 和一個心愛的人
I could live in a tent - a tent! - with the man I love.

443
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:37,827
我能發現他什麼呢，你又有多少不知道的呢...
What I have found out about him and what you probably do not know...

444
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:38,923
我知道一切
I know everything.

445
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:41,211
你不知道這個男人是個賭徒
What you probably do not know is the man's a gambler.

446
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:44,389
他有很多的債務
He has accumulated significant debts.

447
00:41:45,144 --> 00:41:47,534
你也有很多的債務啊
And you had an enormous debt.

448
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:49,737
當你開鋼廠的時候
When you started your steel mill. You did.

449
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:51,847
- 我的回答是不 - 為什麼？
- My answer remains no. - Why ?

450
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:55,449
我不同意這個...
I will not give my consent to this...

451
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:58,259
幼稚的想法
This childish plan.

<i>夜鶯內心流出的血滴</i>
<i>The nightingale with the drops Of his heart's blood</i>

<i>之後風來了</i>
<i>Then came the wind.</i>

455
00:42:27,615 --> 00:42:30,645
<i>妒忌的心情，心煩意亂</i>
<i>And catching at the boughs in envious mood,</i>

456
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:34,175
<i>他的心中縈繞著大量的荊棘</i>
<i>a hundred thorns about his heart entwined.</i>

457
00:43:20,172 --> 00:43:23,948
這是來自德黑蘭的外交郵件
This just arrived by diplomatic pouch from Tehran.

458
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:32,952
上面說，在河旁邊的岩石上發現了
It says that the coin and the clothes of Mr. Henry Cadogan

459
00:43:33,054 --> 00:43:36,929
亨利 卡多根的衣服和硬幣
were found neatly arranged on a rock by the river.

460
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:45,050
卡多根的屍體第二天也被發現
Cadogan's body was found the following day

461
00:43:45,052 --> 00:43:48,219
在懸崖的下面
at the bottom of a cliff.

462
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:51,384
河的對岸
On the opposite side of the river.

463
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:57,883
大使館很遺憾的通知你，這是一個意外事故
The embassy regret to inform you about this tragic accident.

464
00:44:01,661 --> 00:44:03,714
這不是意外事故
It was no accident.

465
00:44:07,315 --> 00:44:10,692
這裡還有一個卡多根的留言
There's also a short note from Cadogan,

466
00:44:10,694 --> 00:44:12,472
我猶豫是否給你
which I hesitate to give to you.

467
00:44:21,432 --> 00:44:22,930
格特魯德，我要走了
Gertrude, I'll leave you now.

<i>永恆的愛情在他自由的羽翼中</i>

<i>Ah! When he found it easy to depart</i>

473
00:45:29,652 --> 00:45:32,726
<i>他給我留下來艱難的人生旅程</i>
<i>He left the harder pilgrimage to me</i>

<i>我人生中第一次認識到我的本質</i>

- 幾年吧 - 幾年？
- For years. - Years ?

488
00:47:25,098 --> 00:47:29,804
但是為什麼在戰爭中要去沙漠呢？
But why venturing out in the desert, in times of war?

489
00:47:30,801 --> 00:47:33,566
你有沙漠的經驗嗎？
Have you ever experienced the desert?

490
00:47:34,674 --> 00:47:36,074
這該怎麼辦？
What does that got to do with it?

491
00:47:37,018 --> 00:47:40,528
我想知道的是，你為什麼來這裡？
What I would like to know is this: what brings you here?

492
00:47:40,628 --> 00:47:43,187
你說，為什麼你離開倫敦更好？
Why did you leave England for good, as you say?

493
00:47:43,189 --> 00:47:45,976
坦白講，我都不理解我自己
To be honest, I did not fully understood myself.

494
00:47:46,176 --> 00:47:47,887
但是我很得意
But I did have my moment of epiphany.

495
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:50,532
貝爾小姐，恕我直言
Miss Bell, allow me to be candid.

496
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:53,093
聽起來很遺憾
This sounds pathetic.

497
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:57,940
你有什麼目的呢？
And what are your intentions?

498
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:02,674
我的目的是離開這裡
My intentions are to move out there

499
00:48:02,774 --> 00:48:05,233
去做些考古的研究

- 去研究貝都因人 - 貝都因人？
- Study the Bedouins. - The Bedouins?

501
00:48:10,222 --> 00:48:12,375
這樣不行
This is not going to happen.

502
00:48:13,712 --> 00:48:17,367
我要提醒你，那裡是土耳其的管轄
May I remind you they're under Turkish administration.

503
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:19,553
你打算申請許可嗎？
Are you going to ask for their permit?

504
00:48:19,555 --> 00:48:22,707
不，我也不需要你的許可
No, and I'm not going to ask for your permit either.

505
00:48:24,826 --> 00:48:26,729
別忘了一件事
Do not forget one thing.

506
00:48:26,984 --> 00:48:31,122
別忘了，我們要征服他們的帝國
Do not forget that soon, we intend to inherit their empire

507
00:48:31,124 --> 00:48:35,900
我不想給我們付出的努力惹上麻煩
I do not want trouble for our ongoing efforts.

508
00:48:35,902 --> 00:48:39,074
你不能引起和土耳其的對抗
You will not stir up confrontation with Turkey

509
00:48:39,075 --> 00:48:42,391
因為貝都因人，他們長期不和
because of the Bedouins. They are feuding among themselves.

510
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:48,259
這很冒險，達不到目的還很危險
Now this little venture of yours is counterproductive and dangerous.

511
00:48:48,947 --> 00:48:52,130
你無權利阻止我
You have no power to stop me.

512
00:48:54,821 --> 00:48:58,340
你不能離開
You will not leave.

513
00:48:58,341 --> 00:48:59,341
我要去
Yes, I will.

514
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:01,856
我已經去過那裡了，我要回去
I have already been out there and I'm going back.

515
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:03,355
祝好，先生們
Good day, gentlemen.

516
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,369
貝爾小姐，我會不惜一切代價
Ms. Bell, even if it costs me

517
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,871
讓土耳其知道你的計劃
to let the Turkish authorities know about your plans,

518
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:09,493
他們會阻止你的
they will intercept you.

519
00:49:10,126 --> 00:49:14,396
這個愚蠢的計劃不會實現的！
This silly business of yours is not going to happen!

520
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:37,689
- 阿圖 - 是的，貝爾小姐
- Fattuh. - Yes, Ms. Bell.

521
00:49:38,148 --> 00:49:42,701
你知道，我們會被捕嗎？
Do you know and the rest of the men know that we may all be arrested?

522
00:49:42,703 --> 00:49:44,331
我有準備
I'm prepared.

523
00:49:45,587 --> 00:49:47,148
為了這個？
Even for that?

524
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,081
阿圖總是有備而來
Fattuh is always prepared.

525
00:50:08,898 --> 00:50:10,632
你們被捕了！
You are under arrest!

526
00:50:10,634 --> 00:50:12,537
你們都被捕了！
All of you are under arrest!

527
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:21,302
中尉，有什麼我能幫忙的嗎？
Lieutenant, is there something I can help you with?

528
00:50:21,304 --> 00:50:23,700
誰允許你們在沒有許可的情況下
Who allowed you to leave in the middle of the night,

529
00:50:23,702 --> 00:50:25,771
半夜離開的？
without a permit by the authorities?

530
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:29,094
- 這裡是不是有誤會... - 我們有許可
- There must be some misunderstanding... - We do have a permit.

531
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,612
- 你是誰？ - 我是阿圖，我是貝爾小姐的隨從
- You, who are you? - I'm Fattuh. The servant of Ms. Bell.

532
00:50:35,645 --> 00:50:39,548
格特魯德 貝爾小姐，我知道你是誰，你帶武器了嗎？
Ms. Gertrude Bell, I know who you are. Do you have any weapons?

533
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:42,090
不，我們沒有
No. We do not.

534
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:57,463
- 這份文檔是直接來自... - 這份文檔直接來自伊斯坦布爾
- This document comes directly... - It comes directly from Istanbul.

535
00:50:57,465 --> 00:50:59,034
直接來自政府
Directly from the ministry.

536
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:03,045
貝爾小姐，我很抱歉
Ms. Bell, I'm so sorry.

537
00:51:03,975 --> 00:51:06,016
我從我們安曼總部聽說...
I heard from our headquarters in Amman...

538
00:51:06,018 --> 00:51:09,688
一個人一般不會被政府注意到的
A man probably just was not notified by your government.

539
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:14,160
都是官僚主義，都一樣的，甚至倫敦都這樣
The ways of bureaucracy are labyrinthal. It's always the same, even in London.

540
00:51:14,162 --> 00:51:16,749
在我們的外交部，所以...
In our Foreign Office, so...

541
00:51:16,751 --> 00:51:19,057
- 就這樣？ - 是的
- Is that so? - Yes. Yes.

542
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:23,732
謝謝，中尉
Thank you, Lieutenant.

543
00:51:23,734 --> 00:51:26,198
你的馬看來需要喝水啊
Your horses look like they need some water.

544
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,189
你需要和我們待一會嗎？
Would you like to share a moment with us?

545
00:51:35,124 --> 00:51:37,197
你哪裡拿到的許可？
Where did you get the permit?

546
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,464
我在安曼清真寺認識一個抄寫員
I know this scribe in the main mosque in Amman.

547
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:43,347
他可以偽造任何東西
He can forge anything for a good bakchich.

548
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:45,265
阿圖
Fattuh.

549
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:51,615
中尉
Lieutenant.

550
00:51:52,006 --> 00:51:55,420
你是從鐵路那裡來的守衛部隊？
Did you come from the garrison at the railway?

551
00:51:55,777 --> 00:51:57,522
是的，女士
Yes, lady.

552
00:51:58,197 --> 00:52:00,462
那裡還有多少騎兵？
And how many cavalries are stationed there?

553
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:02,605
大約60人
About 60.

554
00:52:02,607 --> 00:52:04,526
但是人數還在減少
But their numbers are dwindling.

555
00:52:04,528 --> 00:52:06,374
四月的時候還有100人
We were 100 in April.

556
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:09,212
- 炮兵部隊呢？ - 解散了
- Artillery? - All gone.

557
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,536
我不應該和你說這些的
I should not tell you that.

558
00:52:12,488 --> 00:52:14,314
我只是個旅行者和科學家
I'm just a traveler and a scientist.

559
00:52:14,414 --> 00:52:17,587
所有人都知道土耳其帝國武力
Everyone knows that the forces of the Ottoman Empire

560
00:52:17,588 --> 00:52:19,385
一直在擴展
are somewhat overstretched.

561
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,756
此外，這些都印在官方報紙上呢
Besides, it's all officially in the papers.

562
00:52:22,896 --> 00:52:25,256
但是我的前哨部隊報紙上沒提起過
But my outpost is not in the papers.

563
00:52:27,451 --> 00:52:29,229
中尉
Lieutenant.

564
00:52:29,231 --> 00:52:31,472
我想給你們拍張照片
I would like to offer you a photograph.

565
00:52:32,928 --> 00:52:34,678
你太客氣了，貝爾女士
You are very kind, lady Bell.

566
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,452
- 你和你的士兵，可以嗎？ - 是的，我很喜歡
- You and your men. Do you accept? - Yes, I'd like to.

567
00:52:38,794 --> 00:52:42,437
因為我不想涉及軍事秘密
Because I do not wish to carry a military secret,

568
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:46,035
我不想給你們曝光
I'm going to give you the exposed negative.

569
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:48,925
- 你可以在安曼得到 - 謝謝
- You can have it developed in Aman. - Thank you.

570
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,274
站在中間
I would say right in the middle.

571
00:52:55,189 --> 00:52:56,615
好的
Yes.

572
00:52:57,304 --> 00:52:59,454
光線很好
The light is beautiful.

573
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:00,857
看這裡
Over here.

574
00:53:03,585 --> 00:53:04,963
好極了
Superb.

575
00:55:44,637 --> 00:55:46,292
<i>親愛的日記</i>
<i>Dear diary,</i>

576
00:55:46,294 --> 00:55:51,063
<i>我們到達了一個綠洲，貝都因人寓言中的某個地方</i>
<i>we have reached an oasis that is something from a Bedouin fable.</i>

577
00:55:51,927 --> 00:55:56,236
<i>幽靜的沙漠，給了我孤獨人生一個安慰</i>
<i>The solitude of the desert gives me consolation in my own solitude.</i>

578
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:02,518
<i>阿圖問我為什麼總是要兩杯茶</i>
<i>Fattuh asked me why I always request two glasses of tea.</i>

579
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:05,227
<i>我能告訴他</i>
<i>Should I tell him</i>

580
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:08,164
<i>這是給我心中的愛人的嗎？</i>
<i>this is for the man who lives in my heart?</i>

581
00:57:05,618 --> 00:57:09,281
<i>一天又一天，我們繼續前進</i>
<i>Day in, day out. We keep moving ahead.</i>

582
00:57:09,283 --> 00:57:12,798
<i>總是在依照慣例紮營</i>
<i>And setting up camp is the same familiar routine.</i>

583
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:16,928
<i>但是我們進入沙漠越深</i>
<i>But the deeper we immerse ourselves into the desert</i>

584
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:20,205
<i>所有事情就像是夢一樣</i>
<i>The more everything seems like a dream.</i>

585
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:25,824
<i>有時候，我們去的地方幾乎無法通過</i>
<i>Some days we move across terrain that is almost impassable.</i>

586
00:57:26,564 --> 00:57:31,059
<i>就像是很堅硬的食鹽，就像是破碎的瓷器</i>
<i>Like the hard crust of salt, like shards of broken porcelain.</i>

587
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:39,576
<i>我常常不看地圖，只是憑我的好奇心指引我前進</i>
<i>Often I don't follow any map, but merely go where my curiosity leads me.</i>

588
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:46,387
<i>在死海東部，我在瓦迪 穆吉發現了秘密的峽谷</i>
<i>East of the Dead Sea I explored the hidden gorge of Wadi Mujib.</i>

589
00:57:47,235 --> 00:57:50,922
<i>我從沒想過在沙漠也能發現如此新鮮的水源</i>
<i>I never expected to find water so fresh in the desert.</i>

590
00:57:56,236 --> 00:57:59,758
<i>找到越多神秘的地方</i>
<i>The deeper I penetrate this mysterious labyrinth</i>

591
00:58:00,405 --> 00:58:02,993
<i>我就越發瞭解我自己</i>
<i>The more I become known to myself</i>

592
00:58:28,273 --> 00:58:32,201
<i>在峽谷的盡頭，阿圖發現了一件神奇的東西</i>
<i>Near the end of the gorge, Fattuh found something curious.</i>

593
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:35,850
<i>應該是新石器時代的矛</i>
<i>It turned out to be a Neolithic spear.</i>

594
00:58:35,852 --> 00:58:38,345
<i>至少有1萬年歷史了</i>
<i>At least 10,000 years old.</i>

595
00:58:41,744 --> 00:58:44,528
<i>我猜在遠古時代</i>
<i>I speculated that in prehistoric times,</i>

596
00:58:44,529 --> 00:58:45,929
<i>那裡一定有戰爭</i>
<i>there must have been war here.</i>

597
00:58:46,664 --> 00:58:49,517
<i>這裡一定是個很不錯的防守要地</i>
<i>And that this must have been a very defensible place.</i>

598
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:52,909
<i>但是阿圖說，「這不可能」</i>
<i>But Fattuh said: "This cannot be."</i>

599
00:58:53,491 --> 00:58:56,162
<i>在早期，世界是個天堂</i>
<i>At such an early time, the world was paradise.</i>

600
00:58:56,735 --> 00:59:00,857
<i>如果我們的一生正直的話，天堂就在召喚我們</i>
<i>And paradise is meant to come upon us again if we leave a righteous life.</i>

601
00:59:01,752 --> 00:59:03,582
<i>這是預言家說的</i>
<i>As foretold by the Prophet.</i>

602
00:59:04,568 --> 00:59:08,847
<i>天堂沒有時間，沒有年齡，沒有住所</i>
<i>Paradise has no time, no age, no dwelling place.</i>

603
00:59:09,832 --> 00:59:11,261
<i>在等待著我們</i>
<i>It awaits us.</i>

604
00:59:15,394 --> 00:59:18,581
<i>這讓我渴望深入去考古</i>
<i>This made me eager to go deeper into archeology.</i>

605
00:59:20,264 --> 00:59:24,197
<i>離峽谷不遠是英國發掘的佩特拉古跡</i>
<i>Not far from the gorge is the British excavation site of Petra.</i>

606
00:59:26,914 --> 00:59:30,597
<i>這是艱難的一天，因為一直在下雨</i>
<i>It was a hard day's travel because of the arrival of early rain.</i>

607
00:59:32,672 --> 00:59:34,228
好極了
Greetings.

608
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:36,338
歡迎，貝爾小姐！
Welcome, Ms. Bell!

609
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,028
歡迎來到我們的家！
Welcome to our home!

610
00:59:38,397 --> 00:59:41,887
我是坎貝爾 湯普森，這是我的同事，T.E 羅倫斯
I'm Campbell Thompson. This is my colleague, T.E. Lawrence.

611
00:59:43,214 --> 00:59:46,049
T.E 代表什麼？
And what does "T.E." stand for?

612
00:59:47,655 --> 00:59:49,501
T.E 代表愛德華 托馬斯
T.E. stands for Edward Thomas.

613
00:59:50,322 --> 00:59:52,599
我不喜歡那兩個名字，太討厭了
I despise both names. They're an abomination.

614
00:59:52,912 --> 00:59:56,083
- 就叫我勞倫斯吧 - 好的，勞倫斯
- Please just call me Lawrence. - Will do, Lawrence.

615
00:59:56,547 --> 00:59:58,111
我們知道你要來
We knew you were coming.

616
00:59:58,113 --> 01:00:00,612
真的嗎？ 我們沒送消息來啊
Really? We didn't send messengers.

617
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:02,945
星星在夜裡看見了你
A meeting of the stars saw you at night,

618
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:05,818
白天，沙子留下了你的腳印
and during the day, the sand down your footsteps.

619
01:00:06,746 --> 01:00:09,149
抱歉，他總是這樣
Sorry, he's always like this.

620
01:00:11,313 --> 01:00:14,250
像你這樣的學生在這裡幹什麼，勞倫斯？
What's a school boy like you doing here, Lawrence?

621
01:00:14,252 --> 01:00:17,630
這個特殊的學生有考古的博士學位
This particular school boy has a PhD in archeology.

622
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:18,814
湯普森...
Thompson...

623
01:00:19,118 --> 01:00:21,624
我有中世紀陶瓷博士學位
I have a PhD in medieval pottery shards.

624
01:00:21,626 --> 01:00:24,950
他就像一個老傢伙一樣，一直跟隨著我
It follows me around like the wafting of an old pinster's fart.

625
01:00:25,736 --> 01:00:27,661
我多久才能擺脫他啊！
How I long to be rid of it!

626
01:00:28,982 --> 01:00:30,168
可以嗎？
Shall we?

627
01:00:44,794 --> 01:00:46,275
這地方太糟糕了
This place is a dump.

628
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:49,384
所有東西都被盜墓者偷走了
Everything has been moved by grave robbers.

629
01:00:49,386 --> 01:00:50,832
一次又一次的
Over and over again.

630
01:00:51,747 --> 01:00:53,098
我們在這裡不知所措
We're simply stuck here.

631
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,310
勞倫斯夢想財寶，大量的金子
Lawrence dreams of great treasures, hoards of gold.

632
01:00:57,857 --> 01:00:59,020
至少...
At least...

633
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:02,486
萬能的金子，給了我們巴比倫居民的泥瓦片的圖書館
God Almighty, give us a library of Babylonian clay tablet

634
01:01:02,586 --> 01:01:04,896
就像德國人發掘美索不達米亞那樣
the likes that the Germans have excavated in Mesopotamia.

635
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:08,302
我們的挖掘方法不適合他們
Our excavation methods are no match for theirs.

636
01:01:09,105 --> 01:01:10,964
這是事實，格特魯德，親愛的
This is true, Gertrude, darling.

637
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,726
「親愛的」
"Darling".

638
01:01:16,696 --> 01:01:19,480
你知道，我在這裡季這種腰帶犯了個大錯
You know, I made a big mistake wearing this belt here.

639
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:22,962
這種腰帶只有單身漢才季
That kind of belt is only worn by bachelors.

640
01:01:23,532 --> 01:01:24,642
然後呢？
And...?

641
01:01:24,644 --> 01:01:27,581
然後...本地的挖掘工人
And... the local excavation workers

642
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,785
就試圖給我找個老婆
have been trying to find me a wife.

643
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:32,844
想像一下，給我找老婆，太可怕了！
Imagine. A wife for me. How horrible!

644
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:35,726
但是他們聽說你要來
But they heard of your arrival

645
01:01:35,727 --> 01:01:38,676
謠言四起，說你是我
and instant rumor spread that you're my bride,

646
01:01:38,776 --> 01:01:40,061
從英國來的新娘
sent from England.

647
01:01:43,368 --> 01:01:46,107
我覺得適合你的人還沒出生呢
I'm not sure the right man for you had been born yet.

648
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:53,277
對於我來講，土耳其帝國撐不了多久了
To me, the Ottoman Empire can't last much longer

649
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:56,398
就像羅馬帝國一樣，在垮台前迅速消失
and it looks like the Roman Empire shall disappear before its collapse.

650
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,336
你覺得會發生什麼？
What do you think's gonna happen?

651
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:01,241
混亂
Chaos.

652
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:03,963
混亂和戰爭
Chaos and war.

653
01:02:05,436 --> 01:02:07,411
你覺得大英帝國能接管嗎
Do you think the British Empire will take over

654
01:02:07,411 --> 01:02:10,054
- 填補上管理的空缺？  - 不，我不敢苟同
- and  fill the void of power? - No, I beg to differ.

655
01:02:11,435 --> 01:02:15,639
我相信一個阿拉伯民族會出現
I believe one of the Arabs'spiritual nations will emerge.

656
01:02:16,382 --> 01:02:17,854
他們才是未來
They are the future.

657
01:02:18,665 --> 01:02:20,064
也許，但是...
Perhaps, but...

658
01:02:20,422 --> 01:02:24,615
任何一個重大的變化可能需要一個世紀的時間
Any meaningful change may take centuries to launch.

659
01:02:24,715 --> 01:02:27,331
- 我們有生之年就能看見... - 十足的政治
- It will happen in our lifetime... - Enough politics.

660
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,756
或者幾十年
Or in a few decades.

661
01:02:28,758 --> 01:02:31,215
我們是考古學家
We are archaeologists.

662
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:33,191
至今，我還是個旅行者
So far, I am only a traveler.

663
01:02:33,193 --> 01:02:35,551
那麼，對於旅行者
Well then, to the travelers.

664
01:02:35,553 --> 01:02:40,081
對於那些發掘地下神秘寶藏的人
And to those who dig up mysteries from under the surface.

665
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:43,969
很抱歉，我們沒有杯子
I'm sorry, we have no glasses.

666
01:02:51,197 --> 01:02:52,590
你知道嗎，格特魯德？
You know what, Gertrude?

667
01:02:54,032 --> 01:02:56,226
不管別人怎麼說
Regardless of what anyone says,

668
01:02:56,228 --> 01:02:59,168
在溫和耀眼的篝火前
under the benign, soft glove of campfire

669
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:01,642
手握蘇格蘭酒
with good scotch in your fist,

670
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:03,562
你會是個很好的新娘
you'd make an terrific bride.

671
01:03:33,552 --> 01:03:35,119
格特魯德！
Gertie!

672
01:03:36,085 --> 01:03:37,653
你吃早飯了嗎？
You had breakfast yet?

673
01:03:38,484 --> 01:03:40,343
喝醉了
Got a hangover.

674
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:46,025
我頭疼，就像羅馬帝國那麼大
I have a Roman Empire size headache.

675
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:49,321
很遺憾我們沒有羅馬式的激情
What a shame we do not have Rome set on fire

676
01:03:49,323 --> 01:03:52,818
羅馬暴君尼祿說起我們經歷。我在火災中呻吟
and Nero singing to us live. I've been moaning the conflagration.

677
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:54,900
他自己心情不好，就放火
He himself started the fire under the right mood.

678
01:03:54,902 --> 01:03:58,352
- 那些是不錯的日子 - 勞倫斯，別說了
- Those were the good days. - Lawrence, keep it down.

679
01:03:59,693 --> 01:04:00,820
格特魯德
Gertie.

680
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:03,289
你不能離開
You can't leave.

681
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,025
當地的女人正試圖給我找個老婆呢
The local women might try to find me a wife.

682
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,823
你想讓我當眾吻你嗎？
Do you want me to kiss you in front of everyone?

683
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,209
絕對需要
Absolutely.

684
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:14,711
我的吻...
My kiss...

685
01:04:15,995 --> 01:04:17,718
我的吻可以釋放你
My kiss shall liberate you.

686
01:04:17,884 --> 01:04:19,101
好極了
Wonderful!

687
01:04:23,913 --> 01:04:25,129
格特魯德...
Gertie...

688
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:28,041
你能，別嫁給我嗎？
would you, please, not marry me?

689
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,525
當然
Absolutely.

690
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,900
三個月後

691
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:43,240
大馬士革英國領事辦公室

692
01:04:43,569 --> 01:04:45,145
請進吧
Please, do come in.

693
01:04:45,891 --> 01:04:47,916
貝爾小姐，這是領事
Ms. Bell, the consul.

694
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:51,987
貝爾小姐...歡迎！
Ms. Bell... welcome!

695
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:53,752
歡迎回來！
Welcome back!

696
01:04:54,918 --> 01:04:57,587
在我們談話之前，請讓我恭喜你
Before we talk business, allow me to congratulate you

697
01:04:57,687 --> 01:05:00,193
通過了土耳其當局的檢查
on your feat of alluding the Turkish authorities.

698
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,333
我有許可，你是否知道我的意思
Well, I had a permit, if you know what I mean.

699
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,351
你怎麼弄到的？
How did you forge it?

700
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:09,956
不是我，是清真寺偉大的抄寫員
It wasn't me, it was a scribe from the Great Mosque.

701
01:05:10,056 --> 01:05:11,407
一個高手
One of the finest.

702
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,583
是的，是我的隨從聯繫的
Yes, it was my servant who contacted him.

703
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:16,940
我確信，如果你需要這個文件，我們可以安排的
I'm sure if you ever needed a document, we could arrange.

704
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,201
大英帝國沒必要耍這等小把戲
The British Empire has no need for such petty tricks.

705
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,254
不
No.

706
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,610
除非要印刷百萬的德國馬克假幣
Except for printing millions of counterfeit Deutschmarks

707
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,123
土耳其想消弱他們的經濟的話
and Turkish piastres, in order to undermine their economies.

708
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,434
請坐
Please, take a seat.

709
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,752
那麼...
Well...

710
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,642
我來這裡是要通知你我計劃去德魯士旅行
I'm here to inform you of my plans to travel to Jabal al-Druze.

711
01:05:39,918 --> 01:05:41,339
你不是認真的吧
You can't be serious.

712
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,340
是的，很嚴肅的
Yes, I most certainly am.

713
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,365
這十年來沒有人去過德魯士
No one has traveled to the Druze in decades.

714
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:48,124
那是時間問題
So it's about time.

715
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,540
沒有英國士兵會陪你去的，貝爾小姐
No British soldier will accompany you, Ms. Bell.

716
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:54,335
那意味著對德魯士人的挑釁
It'd mean a provocation for the Druze people.

717
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:56,942
- 我自己做為一個士兵... - 陸軍上校...
- I myself as a soldier... - Major...

718
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:59,134
韋爾奇皇家火槍隊的陸軍上校
Major of the Royal Welch Fusiliers.

719
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,372
貝爾小姐，我們似乎已經瞭解對方了
Ms. Bell, we seem to know quite a lot about each other already.

720
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:05,420
陸軍上校...
Major...

721
01:06:06,623 --> 01:06:10,700
我來是問問你是否準備好了去做一個志願者
I'm here to ask you for what you're already so graciously volunteering.

722
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,472
即使你幾個月也沒看到我的來信
Even if you do not hear from me for several months

723
01:06:13,572 --> 01:06:15,301
沒有注意我，也不回復我
pay no attention and send no one.

724
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:21,468
- 德魯士人會認為你是個間諜 - 是的，也許我就是
- The Druze will take you for a spy. - Yeah, or maybe I am.

725
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:25,054
也許我是個間諜，但是我是我自己的間諜
Maybe I am a spy, but I am a spy for no one.

726
01:06:25,055 --> 01:06:27,241
是我自己的
No one but myself.

727
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:37,469
我是領事的妻子
I am the consul's wife.

728
01:06:37,504 --> 01:06:39,620
- 是的 - 別太拘束，親愛的
- Yes. - Don't be so formal, dear.

729
01:06:40,485 --> 01:06:43,045
貝爾小姐，這是朱迪斯
Ms. Bell, this is Judith. Welcome.

730
01:06:43,154 --> 01:06:45,303
我給你帶來了禮物
I brought you a present.

731
01:06:45,338 --> 01:06:47,168
你們一人一個
One for each of you.

732
01:06:48,203 --> 01:06:49,855
你太客氣了
This is very kind.

733
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,651
我在露天市場發現的
It's just something I found in a souk.

734
01:06:51,686 --> 01:06:54,470
- 我該如何是好呢？ - 太漂亮了
- What do I do with it? - That's beautiful.

735
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:58,985
親愛的，可以在廚房用來切洋蔥
My love, use them in the kitchen for your onions.

736
01:07:00,414 --> 01:07:01,512
來吧
Come.

737
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:09,179
但是德魯士人很獨立
But the Druze are fiercely independent.

738
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,331
反對一切東西，反對土耳其
And more than anything, anti-Turkish.

739
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:14,802
事實上，他們是唯一擊敗土耳其的人
In fact, they're the only people ever to have defeated the Turks.

740
01:07:14,837 --> 01:07:17,289
這到另人很感興趣
Ans this is what makes them so interesting.

741
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:21,153
另外，他們的宗教信仰有基督教徒，諾斯替教徒，新教
Besides, their faith incorporates Christian, Gnostic, Neoplatonic,

742
01:07:21,253 --> 01:07:23,133
包含了整個的伊斯蘭信仰
which overlay their Islamic beliefs.

743
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,140
別再談這些柏拉圖了
Please, let's not talk about Plato.

744
01:07:26,674 --> 01:07:28,141
你還想要些燕麥粉嗎？
Would you like some more of the couscous?

745
01:07:28,142 --> 01:07:30,100
親愛的，我們不是在討論柏拉圖
We're not talking about Plato, my love.

746
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,903
我們在討論的是一個很大的危險，貝爾小姐的信仰
We're talking about a very grave danger: Ms. Bell's faith.

747
01:07:34,362 --> 01:07:35,754
這是值得的
It will be worthwhile.

748
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,918
要當心
Be careful.

749
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,431
德魯士人不按遊戲規則辦事
The Druze do not play the game as it should be played.

750
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:45,470
他們外出搞屠殺，趕盡殺絕
They go out to slay, and they spare no one.

751
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:48,210
他們的槍裡裝滿了火藥
While they have enough dry powder in their flasks,

752
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:49,747
隨時準備扣動扳機
and strenghth to pull the trigger,

753
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,721
他們殺掉所遇到的所有男人，女人和小孩兒
they kill every man, woman and child they encounter.

754
01:07:52,756 --> 01:07:54,209
好可怕啊！
How awful!

755
01:08:04,937 --> 01:08:07,840
- 什麼？  - 我要你拿著這些
- What? - I want you to have them.

756
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:11,230
不...
No...

757
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,250
不，太多了
No, it's too much.

758
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,125
親愛的...
Dear...

759
01:08:16,234 --> 01:08:20,241
你不是說過好幾次，不再拿出這些手槍了嗎？
Have you no said on several occasions you would never give these pistols away?

760
01:08:22,142 --> 01:08:23,178
那麼...
Well...

761
01:08:24,905 --> 01:08:27,473
現在，它們要消失了
Now they are, given away.

762
01:08:28,534 --> 01:08:30,713
貝爾小姐，送給你了
Ms. Bell, for you.

763
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,199
給我了？
For me?

764
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:08,809
<i>我們正穿越貝都因人廣闊的地域</i>
<i>We are traveling across the vast expanse of Bedouin lands.</i>

765
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:11,451
<i>我密切關注著這裡複雜的</i>
<i>And my eyes are opening to the complexity</i>

766
01:09:11,752 --> 01:09:14,130
<i>部族關係</i>
<i>of tribal relations here.</i>

767
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,626
<i>阿圖是我所有一切的指導老師</i>
<i>Fattuh has been my gracious teacher in all of this.</i>

768
01:09:18,661 --> 01:09:23,190
<i>他說，衝突主要發生在德魯士人和貝尼 莎哈人之間</i>
<i>He says the most volatile conflict is between the Druze and the Beni Sakhr.</i>

769
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,221
我擔心的是奧馬爾，貝爾小姐
My worry is Omar, Ms. Bell.

770
01:09:34,578 --> 01:09:37,079
是的，我早上發現他是貝尼 莎哈人
Yes, I only found out this morning that he was Beni Sakhr.

771
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,409
我們應該留下他嗎？
Should we leave him behind?

772
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:44,694
德魯士人和貝尼 莎哈人之間都是毫不留情的
There's no mercy between Druze and Beni Sakhr.

773
01:09:44,794 --> 01:09:48,340
如果他們兩者相遇，只有一個能活下來
If two of them meet, only one survives.

774
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:05,780
貝爾小姐！
Ms. Bell!

775
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,610
是的
Yes.

776
01:10:09,169 --> 01:10:12,225
我覺得，德魯士人能通過口音發現奧馬爾
I realized that the Druze would recognize Omar as a Beni Sakhr

777
01:10:12,226 --> 01:10:13,426
是貝尼 莎哈人
by his accent.

778
01:10:13,973 --> 01:10:15,858
我怎麼沒想到啊
I did not think about that.

779
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:17,811
我們該怎麼辦？
What do we do?

780
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:20,155
問問奧馬爾
Ask Omar.

781
01:10:22,249 --> 01:10:25,241
奧馬爾，我要早點把你送回去嗎？
Omar, should I send you back before it's too late?

782
01:10:31,779 --> 01:10:33,410
奧馬爾突然變成了啞巴
Omar suddenly became a deaf-mute.

783
01:10:35,026 --> 01:10:36,047
什麼時候？
When?

784
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:37,706
一小時之前
An hour ago.

785
01:11:16,174 --> 01:11:18,525
你們是我的犯人了，你們會死的！
You are my prisoners, you'll die!

786
01:11:18,526 --> 01:11:20,585
- 你們所有人！ - 如果我死了...
- All of you! - If I die...

787
01:11:22,249 --> 01:11:23,698
要死也要死在你們酋長的手裡
it should be at the hands of your sheikh.

788
01:11:24,935 --> 01:11:26,960
你們的酋長在哪兒？- 帶我去見他
Where's your sheikh? Take me to him.

789
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:29,373
- 貝爾小姐，你受傷了！ - 沒事
- Ms. Bell, you're wounded! - Nothing.

790
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,220
沒事，帶我去見酋長！
Nothing. Give me your sheikh now!

791
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:36,195
現在！
Now!

792
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:52,842
女人要通過女人的入口進入
A woman passes through the entrance at the women's side.

793
01:11:52,877 --> 01:11:55,193
拿我當男人看待吧
This woman is joining the men.

794
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,500
請坐
Sit down.

795
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,212
請坐，女人
Sit down, woman.

796
01:12:07,626 --> 01:12:09,046
請坐
Please.

797
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,785
你怎麼敢來這裡？
Who are you to dare come here?

798
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:16,020
我是格特魯德 貝爾
I'm Gertrude Bell.

799
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:18,671
我是大英帝國的科學家
And I am a subject of the British Empire.

800
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,055
感謝主，你不是德國人
Thank the Almighty that you're not German.

801
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:24,347
請坐吧
Have a seat, please.

802
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,994
我每天都感謝他，我不是的
I thank him every day that I am not.

803
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:42,577
- 你是間諜嗎？ - 不
- Are you a spy? - No.

804
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,476
我是個作家
I'm a writer.

805
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:49,272
我描寫美麗的大陸和民族
I write about the beauty of the land and its people.

806
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:51,672
那麼你是個詩人
So, you're a poet.

807
01:12:52,705 --> 01:12:55,990
可以說是的，但是我不是只描述...
In a way, but in fact, I do not describe...

808
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:57,670
我所見到的...
what I see...

809
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,212
我只描述它的美麗
I just name its beauty.

810
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,290
很多脈絡中的...
Much in the vein of the...

811
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:06,265
羅馬詩人維吉爾
Roman poet Virgil.

812
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,370
他是一個伊尼德
He's an aeneid.

813
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,060
是的
Yes.

814
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:18,101
我很抱歉，但是德魯士的酋長怎麼知道維吉爾的呢？
I'm so sorry, but how does the sheikh of the Druze know about Virgil?

815
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:22,669
我常旅行...隱姓埋名
I have traveled... incognito.

816
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:25,388
我去過大馬士革
I've been to Damascus.

817
01:13:25,423 --> 01:13:26,751
去過貝魯特
To Beirut.

818
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,240
去過巴黎
To Paris.

819
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:31,911
法國的愛麗捨是世界上最美的大道
Les Champs-Elyss, la plus belle avenue du monde.

820
01:13:32,146 --> 01:13:33,561
波德萊爾...
Baudelaire...

821
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,580
邪惡之花
Et ses "Fleurs du mal". Rimbaud.

822
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,174
你是對的，這個詩人從不描述任何事情
You're right, this poet never describes anything.

823
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:44,276
他只描述宗教的榮耀
He just names the glory of the trees,

824
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,835
蜂巢...
the beehives...

825
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:48,858
國民的生活
and the life in the country.

826
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,907
他喜歡我們詩文
He's like our poets.

827
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,932
是的
This is true.

828
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:02,324
我可以叫我的隨從進來嗎？
May I ask in one of my trusted men?

829
01:14:02,325 --> 01:14:03,474
請吧
Please do.

830
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:06,596
阿圖...
Fattuh...

831
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,708
你能把我的木箱子拿來嗎？
would you fetch me my wooden case?

832
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,307
貝爾小姐...
Ms. Bell...

833
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:16,419
我希望我的人沒有傷害到你
I hope my men didn't hurt you.

834
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:23,614
他們做了，但是只是個小傷，這個我們叫做恩賜
They did, but it is a small wound. It is what we call grace.

835
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:26,440
請原諒他們
Forgive them.

836
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,348
他們不懂事理
They know no better.

837
01:14:29,649 --> 01:14:30,710
對不起
I'm sorry.

838
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,302
我想給你一個禮物
I want like to give you a gift.

839
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:41,690
這是對於我很珍貴的，有人送給我的
It is something very precious to me and it was given to me. And now,

840
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,916
現在送給你了
now, it is yours.

841
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,533
很精緻啊！
Exquisite!

842
01:14:55,066 --> 01:14:57,633
作為客人留下來
Stay as my guest.

843
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:01,890
你將得到我們熱情的款待
You are under the protection of our hospitality.

844
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,677
很高興你回來了
Good to have you back.

845
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:02,060
受了點小傷...但是還活著
A noble bow wound... but alive.

846
01:16:02,161 --> 01:16:04,502
沒事的
Please, it's nothing. Nothing.

847
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,797
但是，我得承認一件事情
But I have to admit something.

848
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:10,898
- 我把手槍送人了 - 他們不是我的，是你的
- I gave away your pistols - They were not mine, but yours.

849
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,000
但是，是你送給我的
But you gave them to me.

850
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:17,280
最終，變得有用了，達到目的了
Finally, it became useful. It was the purpose.

851
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:19,700
- 我很抱歉 - 貝爾小姐
- I'm sorry. - Ms. Bell,

852
01:16:19,735 --> 01:16:22,591
請保持安靜？最後，有些事發生了
will you please keep quiet? Finally, someting happened.

853
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:24,053
子彈
Bullets.

854
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:32,111
現在我有個新的計劃，我要去哈里
Now I have a new plan, I want to go to Hayri.

855
01:16:32,146 --> 01:16:35,808
但是，這是阿拉伯沙漠的中部，那可是禁區啊
But it is the middle of the Arabian desert. It's the forbidden zone.

856
01:16:35,843 --> 01:16:39,471
我們只有一些來自十九世紀五十年代年旅行者的報告
We have only a few reports from some travelers in the 1950's.

857
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,799
為什麼是哈里？
Why for God's sake Hayri?

858
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,203
因為這是阿拉伯世界的神秘中心
Because it is the secret epicenter of the Arab world

859
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:48,139
我要見見埃米爾 莫哈默德
and I want to meet the emir Ibn Rashid.

860
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:51,801
他很重要，他是阿拉伯的領袖
He is important He is the leader of Arabia.

861
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,070
- 誰和你一起去？ - 阿圖
- Who would be with you? - Fattuh.

862
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,618
還有我的人
And my men.

863
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,723
怎麼了？ 我信任他們
What? I trust them.

864
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:18,284
你到的太早了
You arrived too early.

865
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:21,592
- 想讓我晚點回去？ - 不
- Want me to come back later? - No.

866
01:17:21,627 --> 01:17:22,767
不，不
No, no, no.

867
01:17:22,802 --> 01:17:24,222
這是幹什麼？
What's going on?

868
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,238
- 這是給你的種馬  - 給我的？
- This stallion is for you. - For me ?

869
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:29,974
你在阿拉伯需要最好的馬
You'll need the best horse in Arabia.

870
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:34,836
但是你在畫畫！我從沒見過這樣的
But you're painting it! I've never seen anything like it.

871
01:17:34,837 --> 01:17:35,872
那麼...
Well...

872
01:17:38,198 --> 01:17:40,629
- 那麼什麼？- 我必須承認
- Well, what? - I have to make a confession.

873
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:44,786
我為你偷的馬！
I stole him for you!

874
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,097
你為我偷的馬？
You stole this horse for me?

875
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,013
看看它的本事
See what he can do.

876
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:03,450
太棒了！
Bravo!

877
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,660
太棒了，撒拉丁
Bravo, Salhadin.

878
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:07,900
太棒了
Bravo.

879
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:12,990
我其實不是偷的，算是徵用吧
I didn't exactly steal him, it was more an act of expropriation.

880
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:16,272
- 在哪兒？ 從誰那裡？ - 從土耳其
-  Where? From who? - From the Turkish authorities.

881
01:18:16,307 --> 01:18:17,893
可以說，從敵人那裡
From the enemy, so to speak.

882
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:18,894
怎麼弄的？
How?

883
01:18:19,419 --> 01:18:21,268
我做了兩件事情
Well, there were  two things I did.

884
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:24,367
我付錢給當地的一個報社編輯
I paid off an editor of a local newspaper

885
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,580
寫一篇關於馬會傳播疾病的文章
to write about a disease spreading among the horses.

886
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:32,323
之後我弄了一個假的獸醫證
Then I took on a false credentials as a vet,

887
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:36,235
我直接去了土耳其的守衛部隊，我給馬做檢查
I went straight to the Turkish garrison, I inspected the horses

888
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:40,263
這匹種馬就在那裡，需要立即被轉移
and this here stallion here had to be removed immediately.

889
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:43,100
我就直接把它拉回來做「隔離」
And I put him straight into quarantine.

890
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:46,747
那麼，閣下，英國領事
So, His Excellency, the British consul

891
01:18:46,748 --> 01:18:50,043
- 理查德 道蒂-懷利... - 我為你偷了馬
- Richard Doughty-Wylie... - I've stolen a horse for you.

892
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:08,149
貝爾小姐
Ms. Bell.

893
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:12,048
- 我叫你來，我... - 沒有人能叫我來
- I have summoned you and I... - No one summons me.

894
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:16,888
我是...邀請你來
I have... invited you.

895
01:19:16,923 --> 01:19:18,234
聽起來好多了
That sounds vaguely better.

896
01:19:18,269 --> 01:19:21,533
讓我們直入主題，好嗎？
Yes. Let's get straight to the point, shall we?

897
01:19:21,568 --> 01:19:26,856
你勇於冒險，我並不傾向於這樣做
You ventured out, and I felt not inclined to support this.

898
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,676
說的委婉些
To put it mildly.

899
01:19:28,711 --> 01:19:32,660
隨著第一次世界大戰的深入
With the size and momentum of the Great War that is gaining,

900
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,559
如果你將你的好奇的事情做的更系統些的話
it'd be of considerable value for our country

901
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:39,570
這會對國家相當有價值的
if you could make your curiosity more... systematic.

902
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:41,723
什麼意思？
Meaning what?

903
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,654
你將是我們情報機構
You would be our only spy

904
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:46,862
在廣闊區域裡唯一的間諜
in a vast area we have little intelligence about.

905
01:19:47,974 --> 01:19:50,641
總之...不
In short... no.

906
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:54,215
- 直接拒絕- 是的，直接拒絕
- A blunt no. - Correct. A blunt no.

907
01:19:55,474 --> 01:19:57,058
我不為任何人工作
I operate for no one.

908
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:03,046
那麼是什麼吸引你去貝都因的呢？
What is it then that attracts you to the Bedouin out there?

909
01:20:03,047 --> 01:20:06,308
這是你和你的世界無法理解的
It is something that you and your world would never understand.

910
01:20:08,009 --> 01:20:09,149
這是他們的自由
It's their freedom.

911
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,503
這是他們的尊嚴
It's their dignity.

912
01:20:13,667 --> 01:20:15,820
這是他們生命的詩歌
It's their poetry of life.

913
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,409
祝你過得愉快
Have a good day.

914
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:24,048
懷利先生！
Mr. Wylie!

915
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,325
理查德，請叫我理查德
Richard. Please say Richard.

916
01:21:29,924 --> 01:21:31,524
理查德...
Richard...

917
01:21:35,288 --> 01:21:36,879
我還沒準備好
I'm not ready.

918
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:40,896
我再不能...
I would never be with...

919
01:21:40,931 --> 01:21:42,268
你再不會怎樣？
You would never what?

920
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:47,906
我不能再和其他人交往
I would never be with a man again.

921
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,113
因為...
Because...

922
01:21:52,286 --> 01:21:53,874
我失去了一個男人
I lost a man.

923
01:21:55,732 --> 01:21:57,524
- 失去？  - 是的
- Lost? - Yes.

924
01:22:00,178 --> 01:22:01,345
我是一個寡婦
I'm a widow.

925
01:22:06,423 --> 01:22:07,423
寡婦？
A widow?

926
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:10,230
是的！不，不...
Yes! No, no...

927
01:22:13,431 --> 01:22:14,846
有點...
Sort of.

928
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:25,839
- 我太傻了 - 不，這是...
- What a clumsy fool I've been. - No, it's...

929
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,097
請原諒我
Will you forgive me?

930
01:22:31,653 --> 01:22:32,967
當然
Of course.

931
01:22:42,044 --> 01:22:43,278
好吧...
Well...

932
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,150
我們還需要什麼？
What else do we need?

933
01:23:18,404 --> 01:23:22,698
奎寧，解藥和蠍子
Quinine, and antidote against scorpions.

934
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:27,490
蠍子，不，我們得小心
Scorpions, no. We'll be watchful.

935
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,667
貝都因人被蟄傷過，不是嗎？
No Bedouin has ever been stung, am I right?

936
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,747
是的，夫人，聽你的
Yes, ma'am. As you wish.

937
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:36,315
這個市場什麼都有
This market has everything we need.

938
01:23:36,316 --> 01:23:40,226
蚊帳，折疊床，浴缸
Mosquito net, a folding bed, a bathtub.

939
01:23:40,261 --> 01:23:41,261
我們需要這個
We need this.

940
01:23:42,124 --> 01:23:43,621
夫人的眼光不錯
The lady has a good eye.

941
01:23:43,656 --> 01:23:45,444
我保證他們是最好的
I assure you they are the best.

942
01:24:14,823 --> 01:24:17,380
- 我要懺悔 - 懺悔？
- I have confession to make. - A confession?

943
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,520
是的
Yes.

944
01:24:20,726 --> 01:24:22,216
那麼好的一匹馬
As wonderful as the horse was,

945
01:24:22,217 --> 01:24:25,374
不應該進入沙漠的
it'd never have made it in the dunes of the desert.

946
01:24:25,409 --> 01:24:26,671
你做了什麼？
What did you do?

947
01:24:27,713 --> 01:24:30,839
我把它賣了，阿圖在市場了做了交易
I traded it. Fattuh traded it in the market place.

948
01:24:31,909 --> 01:24:37,151
換來了4只非常不錯的駱駝，在那兒呢
For four of the very best dromedaries. There they are.

949
01:24:37,152 --> 01:24:38,518
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

950
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,350
格特魯德，別現在就走
Gertrude, don't leave. Not now.

951
01:24:43,571 --> 01:24:44,967
理查德，我別無選擇
Richard, I have no choice.

952
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:50,698
我內心還沒準備好
My heart is not ready.

953
01:24:52,739 --> 01:24:53,950
我能感覺到
I can feel that.

954
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:59,484
- 再多待幾個星期 - 不，已經12月底了
- Stay for just a few more weeks. - No, it's late December.

955
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:02,381
很快，就去不成沙漠了
Very soon, the dessert won't be possible.

956
01:25:06,287 --> 01:25:09,539
- 我很喜歡你 - 請別這樣說
- I'm longing for you. - Please do not say that.

957
01:25:09,574 --> 01:25:11,905
別說這些事情了
Do not say these things.

958
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:20,646
- 沒有你我會很孤獨的 - 你有妻子啊
- It'll all be lonely without you. - You have a wife.

959
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:25,016
婚姻的不幸福，讓我有著無法忍受的孤獨
It is the most unbearable loneliness to be married unhappily.

960
01:25:25,051 --> 01:25:28,951
這樣是沒有結果的，理查德
This comes at me from nowhere, Richard.

961
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,952
另外，我不可能和你結合，你是個已婚男士
Besides, I could never fully be yours. You're a married man.

962
01:25:36,019 --> 01:25:37,172
我會安排好一切的
I'll settle everything.

963
01:25:41,529 --> 01:25:42,612
你會給我寫信嗎？
Will you write to me?

964
01:25:47,237 --> 01:25:50,988
每到沙漠的郵局，我都會給你寫信的
I'll write you from every post office in the desert.

965
01:25:56,170 --> 01:25:58,072
我會給你留一本日記
I'll keep a diary for you.

966
01:26:04,779 --> 01:26:06,960
風吹來了...
The wind...

967
01:26:08,089 --> 01:26:09,369
吹來什麼？
What?

968
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:14,370
風吹來了沙子，吹來了沙塵暴
The wind is coming with sand.

969
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:07,700
1915年元旦

970
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,565
夫人你能教我怎麼做嗎？
Can the lady show me how to do it?

971
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:03,604
煮雞蛋？
To cook an egg?

972
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:07,459
沙漠不認識雞蛋，沙漠也不認識母雞
The desert knows no eggs. The desert knows no hens.

973
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:10,538
你煮大約5分鐘
You boil it for 5 minutes.

974
01:29:10,573 --> 01:29:13,264
沙漠沒有時間的概念
The desert knows no minutes.

975
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:15,944
一個禱告那麼長的時間
The length of a prayer.

976
01:29:16,683 --> 01:29:18,180
我有了個禮物
You have a present.

977
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,010
<i>理查德...</i>
<i>Richard...</i>

978
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,919
<i>我試著不去想你</i>
<i>I'm trying to keep you out of my thoughts,</i>

979
01:29:34,954 --> 01:29:37,079
<i>但是很奇怪</i>
<i>but it's strange.</i>

980
01:29:37,114 --> 01:29:40,191
<i>在沙漠每走一步我都在想著你</i>
<i>You are on my mind in every step of the desert.</i>

981
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:43,392
<i>我的廚師沒有時間的觀念</i>
<i>My cook does not have a notion of time.</i>

982
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,110
<i>他都不會煮雞蛋</i>
<i>He's never boiled an egg.</i>

983
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:51,060
<i>可以說我已經落後了，沒有按時到達</i>
<i>Already I've dropped back in the desert as if it were my own place.</i>

984
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:57,003
<i>寂寞和孤獨縈繞著我，像是個阻擋我的面紗一樣</i>
<i>Silence and solitude fowling around me like an impenetrable veil.</i>

985
01:29:58,070 --> 01:30:01,700
<i>比在城裡睡的深沉</i>
<i>Sleep more profound than civilization can thrive.</i>

986
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:05,120
<i>然後又是無際的沙漠</i>
<i>And then the roadless desert.</i>

987
01:30:05,155 --> 01:30:06,157
<i>繼續前進</i>
<i>Again.</i>

988
01:30:14,878 --> 01:30:17,905
部落戰爭前，這裡還很有生機
Before the tribal wars, this place was alive.

989
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:20,903
現在，這裡只剩下幽靈了
Now there are only ghosts here.

990
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:35,215
這是什麼？
What is this?

991
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:39,206
這怎麼可能？
How is this possible?

992
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:42,916
從領事那裡來的信？
Is it from the consul?

993
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:48,131
領事的信必須夜以繼日不停的被送出
The consul's messenger must have been riding day and night.

994
01:30:50,887 --> 01:30:52,935
我們今晚在這裡過夜
We shall stay here tonight.

995
01:30:58,342 --> 01:30:59,710
<i>我親愛的</i>
<i>My beloved,</i>

996
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:04,922
<i>沙漠有你，我的心也和你在一起</i>
<i>the desert has you and my heart is with you.</i>

997
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:08,803
<i>如果在一個美好的夜晚我能自由的話</i>
<i>If I was free and a very perfect night,</i>

998
01:31:09,251 --> 01:31:13,594
<i>我會帶上你並且吻你</i>
<i>it's be more fitting to take you and kiss you.</i>

999
01:31:13,629 --> 01:31:17,282
<i>上帝似乎給了我們結合的機會</i>
<i>God seems to have joined us for some divine moment.</i>

1000
01:31:19,955 --> 01:31:21,209
<i>啊，太高興了！</i>
<i>Ah, the ecstasy!</i>

1001
01:31:23,582 --> 01:31:24,905
<i>我們會再次見面的</i>
<i>We might reach it again,</i>

1002
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:27,434
<i>在下一個前哨站</i>
<i>on an outpost of time.</i>

1003
01:31:35,711 --> 01:31:39,019
<i>我無法入睡...我無法入睡</i>
<i>I can't sleep... I can't sleep.</i>

1004
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:41,132
<i>已經是早上了</i>
<i>It is one in the morning.</i>

1005
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:47,202
<i>你和我之間還有少許的安寧</i>
<i>You and you and you are between me and any rest.</i>

1006
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:50,534
<i>你喚醒了我的生命</i>
<i>You once called me life.</i>

1007
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:55,583
<i>火焰，焰火，我燃燒殆盡</i>
<i>And fire. I flame and I'm consumed.</i>

1008
01:31:56,504 --> 01:31:59,382
<i>有句話我一直想說，那就是...</i>
<i>There is a voice in me I try to chase away. It says...</i>

1009
01:31:59,383 --> 01:32:03,305
<i>「在我有生之年，說出來，帶我走吧」</i>
<i>"Before all other world, claim me and take me."</i>

1010
01:32:06,026 --> 01:32:07,480
<i>可是...</i>
<i>And yet...</i>

1011
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,384
<i>理查德...</i>
<i>Richard...</i>

1012
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:15,735
<i>我覺得世界上所有人都和我一樣高興了</i>
<i>I doubt there is anyone in the world so happy as I am now.</i>

1013
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:19,095
<i>你在沙漠中接受洗禮</i>
<i>You were baptised in the desert</i>

1014
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,632
<i>這裡沒有你的救世主</i>
<i>and there is no another salvation for you.</i>

1015
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:26,877
<i>當我們前進的時候，我感覺</i>
<i>When we are on the move, I feel</i>

1016
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:30,095
<i>所有事情都過去了</i>
<i>everything is behind us.</i>

1017
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:33,072
<i>唯有我的影子一直跟著我</i>
<i>Only our shadows follow.</i>

1018
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:35,018
<i>這讓我們想起</i>
<i>As if to remind us</i>

1019
01:33:35,963 --> 01:33:37,732
<i>我們過去的生活</i>
<i>of our past lives.</i>

1020
01:36:24,878 --> 01:36:28,752
你很勇敢，像貝都因人一樣
The lady is bold, as bold as any Bedouin man.

1021
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:33,161
- 你的目的地是哈里？  - 是的
- Is your destination Hayri? - It is.

1022
01:36:33,817 --> 01:36:36,119
我想見見本 拉什德
I want to meet bin Rashid.

1023
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:41,435
我們可以好好說說本 拉什德
We have to talk a lot about bin Rashid.

1024
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:42,936
他是個很強大的敵人
It has powerful enemies.

1025
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:44,240
沙特阿拉伯？
Ibn Saud?

1026
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:47,728
還有其他的
Yes, and many others.

1027
01:36:47,763 --> 01:36:50,335
- 你在哈里見不到他的 - 他在哪兒？
- You will not find him in Hayri. - Where is he ?

1028
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:52,502
他在南部打仗呢
He's at war in the South.

1029
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:56,248
我以為已經和平了
I thought he was at peace.

1030
01:36:56,283 --> 01:37:01,688
不再是了。在哈里要特別小心，那裡還有各種謀殺
Not any longer. Beware of Hayri. There is a lot of murdering going on.

1031
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:07,158
給我的？ - 是的
- For me? - Yes.

1032
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:38,574
你這樣熱情的款待我
You've shown me such gratious hospitality.

1033
01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:43,134
你還給我講述了精彩的沙漠故事
And you have entertained me with wonderful desert stories.

1034
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:45,592
每一個貝都因人都擅長講故事
Every Bedouin is a storyteller.

1035
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:52,026
但是你還給我了很多關於哈里部落的信息
But you have also given insight into the tribes and the tribes of Hayri.

1036
01:37:53,206 --> 01:37:56,343
為了這個...我要好好感謝你
And for that... I want to thank you.

1037
01:37:57,298 --> 01:37:59,651
我想把這個送給你
I would like to give you these.

1038
01:37:59,973 --> 01:38:01,908
這是我的望遠鏡
These are my binoculars.

1039
01:38:03,273 --> 01:38:05,487
我現在可以看的很清楚了，所以我不再需要這個了
I can see clearly now, so I do not need him.

1040
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,390
這是給你的禮物
These are a gift.

1041
01:38:09,127 --> 01:38:13,068
我將成為一個富有的旅行者
I've become a desert traveler who is very rich.

1042
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:15,659
謝謝
Thank you.

1043
01:38:16,094 --> 01:38:19,068
我的嚮導，哈米德，會護送你們的
And my guide, Ahmed, will be your escort.

1044
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,949
你一路上不會有事的
No harm will be done to you on your way.

1045
01:38:21,984 --> 01:38:25,189
但是到了哈里，可能就出不來了
But once in Hayri, no one gets out.

1046
01:38:25,570 --> 01:38:30,184
但憑天意，我很想再見到你...活著的
Inshallah. We want to see you again... alive.

1047
01:38:31,219 --> 01:38:32,440
但憑天意
Inshallah.

1048
01:38:35,397 --> 01:38:37,062
你可以看得非常遠
You can see very far.

1049
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:49,007
奴隸，我不知道準確的含義
Slaves, I don't know exactly what this means.

1050
01:40:49,042 --> 01:40:51,039
但是，這是一種侮辱，我確定
But it's an insult, I'm sure.

1051
01:40:52,257 --> 01:40:53,277
只有女人可以
Only the woman.

1052
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:55,872
男人留下來
Men will stay behind.

1053
01:40:55,907 --> 01:40:58,415
只有女人可以進去
Only the woman is invited here.

1054
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:28,655
我是易卜拉欣
My name is Ibrahim.

1055
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:19,902
我是法蒂瑪，埃米爾的姨媽
I am Fatima, the aunt of the emir.

1056
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:22,402
她是突卡婭，她會接待你們的
This is Turkia, who will entertain you.

1057
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,301
歡迎來到哈里
Welcome to Hayri.

1058
01:43:24,336 --> 01:43:25,965
你一定是沙漠女王
You must be the Lady of the desert.

1059
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:28,373
傳聞比你的駱駝來的快啊
Rumor has been faster than your camels.

1060
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:30,185
我是格特魯德 貝爾
I'm Gertrude Bell.

1061
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,034
誰帶你來的？
Who has sent you?

1062
01:43:34,330 --> 01:43:35,778
沒有人
No one.

1063
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,914
不，我自己來的
No, I'm here on my own.

1064
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:41,516
你自己？
On your own?

1065
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,028
我很通情達理
I know the world.

1066
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:47,261
我從伊斯坦布爾來
I come from Istanbul.

1067
01:43:47,964 --> 01:43:50,741
蘇丹把我作為禮物送給了埃米爾 拉什德
The Sultan has sent me as a gift to Emir Rashid.

1068
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:53,052
你有什麼計劃？
What are your plans?

1069
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:57,941
我想見見埃米爾 拉什德
I would like to meet Emir Rashid.

1070
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,805
埃米爾 拉什德被趕出哈里了
Emir Rashid has been driven off Hayri.

1071
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:30,378
他的女人跟隨著他
His women followed him.

1072
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,754
還有他的部落成員
And all tribe's men.

1073
01:44:33,789 --> 01:44:36,052
但是他卻把我留下了
But he left me behind.

1074
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:40,076
- 他是埃米爾的客人？ - 是的
- He was a guest of the Emir? - Yes.

1075
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:42,207
埃米爾 胡裡德，六年前
The Emir Harrud, six years ago.

1076
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:44,165
發生什麼事情了？
What happened?

1077
01:44:46,090 --> 01:44:48,772
這個皇宮充滿了陰謀
This palace is full of conspiracies.

1078
01:44:48,807 --> 01:44:50,100
到處是暗殺
Full of murder.

1079
01:44:52,222 --> 01:44:53,849
埃米爾怎麼樣了？
What happened to the Emir?

1080
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:56,080
他被謀殺了
He was assassinated.

1081
01:44:57,130 --> 01:45:00,574
他的繼承人也被謀殺了，之後的繼承人也被謀殺了

1082
01:45:00,609 --> 01:45:02,318
所有人，在這幾年時間裡

1083

大臣也被殺了
The Eunuchs were killed with them

1084
01:45:07,889 --> 01:45:11,921
所有的女人都在男人之間被轉來轉去
and the entire harem was passed from man to man to man.

1085
01:45:15,133 --> 01:45:16,824
現在誰統治帝國呢？
Who is the ruling Emir now?

1086
01:45:16,859 --> 01:45:19,835
他的家族裡都沒什麼人了
There was hardly anyone left in his family.

1087
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:21,855
他也很年輕
So, he's young.

1088
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:24,262
他在北方打仗
He's raiding in the North.

1089
01:45:24,297 --> 01:45:26,639
法蒂瑪，他的姨媽
Fatima, his aunt,

1090
01:45:26,674 --> 01:45:30,412
是真正的統治者，她是真正的皇帝

1091
01:45:40,091 --> 01:45:41,091
太美了
It's beautiful.

1092
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:54,228
我在這裡作為犯人被關了三個星期了
I have been a prisoner here for three weeks now.

1093
01:45:55,410 --> 01:45:57,499
你不是個犯人
You are not a prisoner.

1094
01:45:58,030 --> 01:45:59,836
你的人也被招待的很好
Your men are taken care well.

1095
01:46:00,362 --> 01:46:03,289
你只需待在這裡等待埃米爾的決定
You are only required to stay until the Emir decides.

1096
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:06,862
決定什麼？
Decides what?

1097
01:46:07,770 --> 01:46:09,531
是否你待在這裡比較好
If it would be good to have you here.

1098
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:12,116
為了什麼？
For what?

1099
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:18,036
我希望你能留下來，做為埃米爾的妻子
My wish is to keep you here, in the harem of the Emir.

1100
01:46:18,398 --> 01:46:20,048
他會很高興的
He would be delighted.

1101
01:46:25,557 --> 01:46:26,795
法蒂瑪...
Fatima...

1102
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:29,794
那不是我的願望
That is not my wish.

1103
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:34,688
他什麼時候回來？
When does he get back?

1104
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:38,910
你知道嗎？
Do you know?

1105
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:09,739
我很高興歡迎我的客人
I am delighted to greet my guest.

1106
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:13,249
他的意思是：「我很高興歡迎他的妻子」
He means: "I am delighted to greet his wife

1107
01:48:13,284 --> 01:48:14,573
「來到我的後宮」
"into my harem."

1108
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:16,829
是的，我的妻子
Yes, my wife.

1109
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:22,256
埃米爾...
Emir...

1110
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:25,607
很榮幸見到你
It is an honor to meet you.

1111
01:48:26,543 --> 01:48:28,848
可是，我已經結婚了
However, I am already married.

1112
01:48:29,570 --> 01:48:32,103
和一個英國領事
I am a member of the British Consul.

1113
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:36,408
這會給一個男人和他的國家帶來麻煩的
And this will cause a problem both for a man and his country.

1114
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:39,180
我已經說過了
I was told otherwise.

1115
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:47,188
「沒有人能碰一個已婚女人」
"No man ever touches a married woman",

1116
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:53,434
預言家告訴我們，要和平相處
the Prophet, peace be upon him, has taught us.

1117
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:59,367
<i>親愛的理查德，我看到的事情已經很明確了</i>
<i>Dear Richard, it's clear from what I've seen</i>

1118
01:49:59,467 --> 01:50:02,035
<i>在哈里，莫哈默德的國家的確正在走向滅亡</i>
<i>that the house of Rashid is moving towards its demise.</i>

1119
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,921
<i>現在阿拉伯半島卻發展迅速</i>
<i>It now appears that Ibn Fold'star is in the ascendant.</i>

01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:11,819
<i>阿拉伯半島的未來就取決於他</i>
<i>And the future of Central Arabia lies with him,</i>

1121
01:50:11,970 --> 01:50:14,450
<i>並不是哈里人</i>
<i>not the people of Hayri.</i>

01:50:14,485 --> 01:50:17,850
<i>我應該把這些告訴英國阿拉伯管理局</i>
<i>I should communicate this to the British Arab Bureau.</i>

1123
01:50:23,872 --> 01:50:27,698
<i>在我探索世界的這些年裡</i>
<i>The explorations that I have undertaken these past years,</i>

<i>展示出了一副美好的畫卷，只有我才能描繪出來</i>
<i>have culminated in a unique picture, one that only I can paint.</i>

1126
01:50:52,699 --> 01:50:56,176
<i>對於我自己，我感覺經過多年的準備</i>
<i>As for myself, I sense that long years of preparation,</i>

1127
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:00,527
<i>準備什麼我也說不好，但已經接近尾聲了</i>
<i>preparation for what I do not know, have ended.</i>

1128
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:03,749
<i>一個新的命運</i>
<i>And a new destiny</i>

1129
01:51:03,784 --> 01:51:05,213
<i>向我駛來</i>
<i>is infolding before me.</i>

1130
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:13,479
<i>我只需要回到你的身邊</i>

1131
01:51:47,454 --> 01:51:48,979
讓我們找個安靜的地方
Let's find somewhere quiet.

1132
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:02,191
我閱讀了你的日記
I've read your diary.

1133
01:52:03,604 --> 01:52:05,955
這是給你寫的
It was meant for you.

1134
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,920
世界在改變
The world is changing.

1135
01:52:11,024 --> 01:52:14,662
當我在沙漠裡的時候，戰爭已經發展為世界大戰
While I was in the desert, the war turned into a World Wide War

1136
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:17,187
我都沒注意到
and I didn't even notice.

1137
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:19,491
所有的歐洲國家
All of Europe now.

1138
01:52:22,230 --> 01:52:23,874
俄國，日本...
Russia, Japan...

1139
01:52:27,611 --> 01:52:30,008
美國也加入了
And America now. They will have it too.

1140
01:52:35,052 --> 01:52:36,789
格特魯德，有件事我要告訴你
Gertrude, there's something that I wanted to tell you.

1141
01:52:41,473 --> 01:52:43,359
我要再次服役

1142
01:52:54,488 --> 01:52:56,060
我也期望
I expected it.

1143
01:52:58,650 --> 01:53:00,326
當我從戰爭中返回時
The moment I'm back from war,

1144
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:02,845
我會處理好和朱迪斯的一切
I shall put everything in order with Judith.

1145
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:06,579
那樣我就自由了
Thus should be free.

1146
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:11,878
沒有你，我寧願...
I'd rather put a bullet in my head...

1147
01:53:11,913 --> 01:53:13,219
開槍自殺
than live without you.

1148
01:53:17,118 --> 01:53:18,641
你為什麼要這樣說？
Why do you say that?

1149
01:53:26,738 --> 01:53:28,579
格特魯德...
Gertrude...

1150
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:32,348
有件事你得知道
There is something you should know.

1151
01:53:34,498 --> 01:53:36,521
朱迪斯有點想不開...
Judith has been making ominous remarks about...

1152
01:53:39,003 --> 01:53:42,236
如果我和她離婚，她要自殺
about committing suicide if I should try to divorce her.

1153
01:53:43,848 --> 01:53:44,979
我明白
I see.

1154
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:46,649
我真不敢相信，但是...
I do not believe it, but...

1155
01:53:53,422 --> 01:53:57,546
愛是自私的
Love is a tyrant.

1156
01:54:14,150 --> 01:54:19,350
1915年7月 開羅，英國阿拉伯事物管理局

01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:37,832
格特魯德...東亞事物大臣，恭喜啊
Gertie... Oriental secretary. Congratulations.

1158
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:40,623
這就是他們發明的郵政快件
It's as if they invented the post foil.

1159
01:54:43,172 --> 01:54:46,009
- 這些都是你的員工？ - 是的
- All this is your staff? - It is.

1160
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:51,222
你也成為高級顧問了，勞倫斯
You have become senior advisor, Lawrence.

1161
01:54:52,297 --> 01:54:54,474
你變成政治家了
You've moved into a political animal.

1162
01:54:55,187 --> 01:54:58,600
- 嚴格講，就像你說的，但是... - 什麼？
- Technically, I'm onto you, but... - What?

1163
01:54:59,590 --> 01:55:02,925
這裡沒有像我這樣的男人，也沒有像你這樣的女人
There are no men like me and no women like you, of course.

1164
01:55:02,926 --> 01:55:06,068
你已經成為了某種女王
You've become some kind of queen.

1165
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:11,140
不，只是個想念自己男人的女兒而已
No, just a woman who misses her man.

1166
01:55:11,175 --> 01:55:13,316
你是說你的男人去參加偉大的戰爭了
You mean your officer who joined the glorious war.

1167
01:55:15,685 --> 01:55:16,685
是的
Yes, I do.

1168
01:55:21,083 --> 01:55:24,115
貝爾小姐...能靠近一點嗎？ 我們想讓
Miss Bell... could you get closer, please? We'd like to get

1169
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:25,739
- 吉薩 皮拉米德進入鏡頭 - 丘吉爾先生！
- the Giza Pyramids in the frame. - Mr Churchill!

1170
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:27,874
請不要動
Still, please.

1171
01:55:27,909 --> 01:55:31,572
丘吉爾先生，您對會議有什麼期望呢？
Mr. Churchill, what are you expecting from the conference?

1172
01:55:31,708 --> 01:55:33,644
先生們，讓我們來面對...
Boys, let's face it...

1173
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:35,546
一個全新的阿拉伯世界
a new order in the Arab World.

1174
01:55:35,581 --> 01:55:38,664
丘吉爾先生，新的政策將在中東實施
Mr. Churchill, with this new emphasis on the Middle East,

1175
01:55:38,699 --> 01:55:41,230
放棄政策要針對印度實施嗎？
where does that leave off policy towards British India?

1176
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:46,112
邱吉爾試圖說明這是大英帝國的一個新的成就
Churchill has tried to sell this as a new achievement of the British Empire.

1177
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:49,576
- 還用問嗎？  - 好了，勞倫斯
- What else is it? - Come on, Lawrence.

1178
01:55:49,676 --> 01:55:51,262
我們沒辦法讓他們自治
We are not leading them towards autonomy.

1179
01:55:51,263 --> 01:55:54,268
這是阿拉伯國家的覺醒，這是他們的成就
It's the Arab nations who are awakening. This is their achievement.

1180
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,572
當然
Of course.

1181
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:02,632
大英帝國之獅
The Lions of the British Empire.

1182
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:05,508
勞倫斯先生，請走這邊
Mr Lawrence, over this way please.

1183
01:56:05,509 --> 01:56:07,956
金字塔作為拍照的背景。先生們...
The pyramids in the background, for the photographers. Gentlemen...

1184
01:56:07,957 --> 01:56:10,506
要拍照，再往左邊一點，先生
You're having a shot. A little to the left, sir.

1185
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:15,399
保持住，勞倫斯先生
Hold tight, Mr. Lawrence.

1186
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:18,005
先生們，我們準備好了嗎？ 這張照片會很驚人的
Gentlemen, are we getting this camp? The shot is marvelous.

1187
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,399
勞倫斯先生！
Mister Lawrence!

1188
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:27,095
天那，先生們，你們拍到了嗎？
Marvelous. Boys, are you getting this?

1189
01:56:27,096 --> 01:56:28,843
就像這樣，再來一次，丘吉爾先生
One more like that, please, Mr. Churchill.

1190
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:33,205
我的雪茄滅了
My cigar... my cigar went out.

1191
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:35,559
真是世界末日啊
That is the end of the world.

1192
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:39,404
再來一次，丘吉爾先生，你們看起來很壯觀
One more, Mr. Churchill. You're all looking splendid.

1193
01:56:41,502 --> 01:56:43,287
你們站在4000年的歷史面前
4,000 years of history upon you.

1194
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:45,577
勞倫斯，閉嘴
Lawrence, shut up.

1195
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,707
拿破侖在你之前說過
Napoleon said that before you.

1196
01:56:47,708 --> 01:56:50,409
好了，好極了！
Yes, all together now. Excellent!

1197
01:57:15,985 --> 01:57:17,955
我們在加利波利的損失很大
Our losses at Gallipoli are staggering.

1198
01:57:17,955 --> 01:57:22,567
澳大利亞遠征軍一天也損失了將近3萬人
and the Australian expedition force has lost 30,000 men in one single day.

1199
01:57:23,768 --> 01:57:25,515
將軍，這是保密的
General, this is classified.

1200
01:57:25,516 --> 01:57:29,401
我不管，明天整個世界都會打開窗戶大聲呼喊的
I don't care. By tomorrow, the whole world will shout of its window.

1201
01:57:29,411 --> 01:57:32,207
道蒂-懷利，指揮的戰鬥
Doughty-Wylie , who led the assault,

1202
01:57:32,208 --> 01:57:34,444
他已經得到了維多利亞十字勳章
has already been awarded the Victoria Cross.

1203
01:57:35,472 --> 01:57:37,201
你是說理查德？
Did you said Richard?

1204
01:57:37,236 --> 01:57:39,125
理查德 道蒂-懷利
Richard Doughty-Wylie ?

你的獵鷹...你的獵鷹配得上國王
