今早11点半 已经到达

中间海滩路44号现场
since about 11:30 this morning.

25
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:54,278
我们来看一下 可以看到
Let’s take a look, you can see 

26
00:00:54,384 --> 00:00:56,101
这条路已经被警方封锁了
the road is blocked off by police, 

27
00:00:56,176 --> 00:00:58,115
他们将这起案件 定性为谋杀案
they are treating this case as a homicide. 

28
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,349
这个位置 视野很模糊
It’s hard to see 44 Middle Beach Road

29
00:01:00,456 --> 00:01:01,814
很难看清 中间海滩路44号的情况
from this vantage point. 

30
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:03,395
已知情况为 一名年近50岁的女性
Here’s what we do know: a woman in 

31
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:06,251
在自家院子中 受到伤害

她被当场宣布死亡

警方没有公布 受害者的姓名

34
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:11,197
但是新闻8号频道得知

35
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,705
一位名叫Barbara Hamburg的女性 租下这座房子
that a woman named Barbara Hamburg rents the house.

36
00:01:14,757 --> 00:01:17,146
我说 不 这不可能是真的
I said no, you’re not telling me, that’s not real. 

37
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:20,023
但这是真的
And it was real. 

38
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:23,151
{\an8}Barbara Lund *Barbara的妈妈

39
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:22,518
感觉自己 遭到当头一棒
It was like being hit by a boulder.

40
00:01:23,662 --> 00:01:26,970
我收到我父亲的 两条语音留言
I had two voicemails from my father, 

41
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:29,377
Leu的两条 Chris的三条
two voicemails from Leu, and three from Chris, 

42
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:31,855
我心想 "要么是中彩票了"
and I went, "Well, either we hit the lottery 

43
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:33,734
"要么是 发生了非常坏的事"
or something awful has happened."

44
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:35,951
你的第一反应是什么
What was your first reaction?

45
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:38,168
我在路上 一直有不祥的预感
Didn’t sound right the whole way up here. 

46
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:43,240
{\an8}Richard Beach *Barbara的哥哥

47
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:39,844
所以事实就是
You know, essentially saying that 

48

我的妹妹 被人谋杀了
my sister had been murdered.

49
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:42,963
呃
Um…

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,479
我记得妈妈 给我发短信
I remember my mom texted me, and 

51
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,860
我当时 正站在航站楼
I was just, like, standing in the middle of

52
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:54,955
心想 "怎么会这样"
the terminal like, "What the fuck."

53
00:01:55,923 --> 00:01:57,545
你回家之后 发生了什么
What happened when you got home?

54
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:01,746
{\an8}Chris Platt
Barbara的表兄

55
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,189
天呐 接着就是一片昏天黑地
Oh man, like the, the chaos begins.

56
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,571
法医判定这是一起凶杀案
The medical examiner ruling the killing a homicide, 

57
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,578
将死者死因 描述为
describing the cause of death as 

58
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:10,640
"钝器创伤和锐器致伤"
"blunt force trauma and sharp force injury."

59
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,736
她的伤口 是什么样的
What kind of wounds did she have?

60
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:15,369
{\an8}Conway Beach

她被人捅了 头部受了重伤
She was stabbed, she had a terrible head wound, 

62
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:23,175

63
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:27,834
他们说她有18处伤

69
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:40,505
还是有目标作案

70

{\an8}Jill Platt
Barbara的大姨

71
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:42,375
这是一场激情犯罪
This is a crime of passion. 

72
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:45,005
要不是因为 私人恩怨
People don’t get murdered, and that brutally, 

73
00:02:45,557 --> 00:02:48,064
人们不会下此毒手
without it being a very personal thing.

74
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:49,578
Barbara Hamburg当时48岁
Stunned and shocked, friends of 

75
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,208
她的朋友 听闻消息后极为震惊

83
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:04,543
我有一些问题
I just have a couple questions.

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,302
你回家时 印象最深刻的是什么事
What was your best recollection of coming home?

86
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:11,466
我感觉不对劲
Something wasn’t right. 

87
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:14,129
我们给她打电话 但联系不到她
We were calling her, we couldn’t get in touch with her..

88
00:03:15,432 --> 00:03:17,673
Ali和我停下车 Ali说
Ali and I pulled up and Ali’s like, 

89
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:19,369
"妈妈的车 为什么停在车道上"
"Why is Mom’s car in the driveway?" 

90
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:21,076
我说 "我不知道"
And I said, "I don’t know. 

91
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:22,665
"Ali 我不知道"
I don’t know, Al."

92
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:26,069
她的钥匙插在门上 但是门还锁着
Her keys were in the door, but the door was locked. 

93
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:29,185
我们进屋之后 大喊她的名字
And we go inside, and we’re screaming her name. 

94
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:31,616
我们在喊她 但不知道她在哪
We’re calling out for her, we don’t know where she is.

95
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,635
哪也找不到她
She’s nowhere to be found. 

96
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:39,093
一切都不对劲
Nothing is making sense.

97
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:42,293
我绕着房子转 听到Conway在尖叫
I go around the house, and I hear Conway screaming.

98
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:45,805
我看到垫子 堆叠在一起
I see these cushions up against the bushes, 

99
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:47,530
我心想 "怎么回事"
and I’m like, "What the hell?"

100
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:50,294
我扯开一个垫子 心想"啊"
So I pull one cushion off and I’m like, "Ah. 

101
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:52,516
"底下是小动物吧"
It’s an animal."

102
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,047
你为什么觉得 会是小动物
Why did you think it was an animal?

103
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,931
我看到的 全是乱糟糟的血和毛发
All I could see was, like, mushedCup hair and blood.

104
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:01,514
你掀开第二个垫子后 看到了什么
So, you pull back the second cushion, what happens?

105
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:03,659
是你妈妈
It’s your mom.

106
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:11,784
嗨 麦迪逊
Hi, Madison.

她说 "妈妈死了"

我想让自己醒过来

因为我知道 这一切不是真的
‘cause I knew that that couldn’t be real.

我生命中 重要的一切
Everything that was important in my life 

116
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:53,624
都在顷刻之间

We’re about to take a brief tour of Connecticut. 

123
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:38,372
在身处外太空的宇航员看来 
In this astronaut’s eye view from outer space,

124
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:40,483
从占地面积上来看 它很渺小
it appears small,  geographically,

125
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:43,583
但越靠近它 它看起来就越大
but it looms increasingly large the closer one approaches.

126
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:46,110
康涅狄格地理位置优越
Connecticut is strategically located 

127
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,881
位于纽约和波士顿之间

位于东北部市场中心 经济发达

00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,932
就是关于她的生活
Just, about, like her life.

149
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:43,992
你妈妈 是个很复杂的人
Well, your mother was a very complicated person. 

150
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:46,709
有一些事 你可能
Things that youC you

152
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,171
甚至都不知道 这些事
or were even cognizant of. 

153
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,820
她有一部分生活
She had a life that I had no

154
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,190
我完全不了解 所以
idea she had, so…

155

你什么意思
What do you mean?

156
00:06:57,488 --> 00:06:58,988
我不知道 能不能说
I’m not sure I can talk about... 

157

我不喜欢说三道四
I certainly don’t want to say things, you

158
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:06,379
有些事我是道听途说 但也许是真的
know, that I heard secondhand, or… but may be true. 

159
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:08,626
这件事情的真相 远远比我们
There’s obviously more to the story than

160
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:10,523
所了解的 更复杂
any of us really know.

161

There they are.

其中两位 已经离我们而去了
And two of them are no longer with us. 

178
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:06,400
不敢相信这样的事实
It’s hard to believe that part. 

179
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:12,146

188
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:31,082
我去参加外婆日的时候
I would go down to Grandparent’s Day, and people

189
00:08:31,183 --> 00:08:33,539
会有人过来跟我说 "我知道你是谁"
would come along and they’d say, "I know who you are."

190
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,258
对
Yeah.

191

" Barbara和你一模一样"

194
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:43,475
你最后一次和她说话 是什么场景
Can you describe the last time you talked to her?

195
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,959
你妈妈吗
Your mom? 

196
00:08:47,141 --> 00:08:49,848
最后一次见她时的场景 我记得更清楚
Well, I can describe the last time I saw her better.

197
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:52,090
她就在那里 她来看我
She was here, she was visiting,

198
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,236
她和我坐在床上
and she and I sat in that bed, 

199
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:57,896
她走之前 我们聊了很久
and talked a long time that night before

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,085
聊了生活近况 等等
she left, about life, and you know. 

201
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:07,785
我清楚地记得 她离开时的样子
I remember distinctly her walking away, um…

202
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:10,281
大家笑一下
Everybody smile!

203
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:14,526
我记得 之后我和你妈妈
And I know I talked to your mom on the phone 

204
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:16,222
通过很多次电话
after that, many times, but

205
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:18,099
但当时的场景 我一直忘不了
that image sticks with me. 

206
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:20,178
那个场景 非常重要
That’s a- that’s a important image. 

207
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,787
那件事之后不久
And that was not too long before

208
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:24,735
她就被谋杀了
she was murdered. 

209
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:27,309
我和你妈妈 关系很好
We had a great relationship, your mom and I, 

210
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,426
我们真的很好
we truly, truly did,

211
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:31,713
所以我非常想她
so I miss her terribly.

212
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:35,663
希望我说的这些
And hopefully this will... 

213
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:37,411
会让你的作品 取得好成绩
you’ll get a good grade.

214
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,615
姥姥 拍这个不是为了交作业
That’s not what this is about, Grammy.

215
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,635
不是吗
Oh, it’s not?

216
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,766
不是 远不止如此
No, this is way more…

217
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,087
我知道了
Oh, I know. 

218
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:45,577
我爱你
I love you.

219
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:46,724
我也爱你
I love you, too.

220
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:51,396
对我来说 最难受的就是看着你
The hardest thing for me was to watch you have to, 

221
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:53,026
不得不经历这些痛苦
have to go through all

222
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:54,711
因为你当时才18岁 但你必须
that, ‘cause you were 18 and you had to 

223
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,457
表现得像 21 22 23 
act like you were 21, 22, 23, 

224
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,154
Maddie 这一定非常难
and that had to be very, very hard, Maddie.

225
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:02,399
其他人不能代你受苦
The rest of us couldn’t do it for you, 

226
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:04,169
必须一个人承受
you had to do it.

227
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,940
半小时前 守夜开始了
The vigil started about a half-hour ago,

228
00:10:09,056 --> 00:10:11,159
家人和朋友们都凑在一起了
with family and friends gathering around.

229
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:12,908
他们点燃蜡烛 以此纪念她
They lit candles in her memory, 

230
00:10:12,998 --> 00:10:15,036
他们想让公众对此事记忆犹新
they want to keep it fresh in the public’s memory 

231
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:16,940
好让有人站出来
in case somebody comes forward.

232
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:19,038
总是有关于你母亲谋杀案的
It’s just always that unanswered question out

233
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:20,970
悬而未决的问题冒出来
there about your mom’s murder.

234
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:24,517
这影响了整个家庭
And, um, it affects the entire family

你注意到她生活中 有什么异常的地方吗

你妈妈有秘密 我不知道
Your mother had secrets, so I don’t know, 

256
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,167
她不会把所有秘密 告诉我
she didn’t share all her secrets with me. 

257
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:29,824
但我一直都知道 她有秘密
But I always knew she had secrets that were, 

258
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:32,729
这些秘密很阴暗 因为她
that were dark secrets, because she had this

259
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:36,947
喘息或者笑起来的时候
way of breathing and smiling that, um, to me, 

260
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:39,205
都是为了掩盖内心
it was a cover up for something that was very

261
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:40,953
很沉重的东西
heavy in her heart. 

262

我不知道那是什么
So, I don’t know what that was,

但我一直知道 有事发生

268
00:11:58,581 --> 00:12:00,592
也会阻碍你
of growing to be a man. 

269
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:03,875
先说说你爸爸妈妈吧

305
00:13:51,754 --> 00:13:54,072
深深地相信
in her heart of hearts that she

306
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:56,972
她嫁给了自己的梦中情人

我觉得她是个很棒的妈妈 真的
I think she was a great mother, I really do.

320
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:51,802
如果她连我都能忍受得了
I mean, if she could put up with me, she was… 

321
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:54,309
任何能忍受得了我的人 都是好妈妈
anyone who could put up with me was a good mom.

322
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:56,475
Madison 你不是个坏孩子
Maddie, you were not a bad child. 

323
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:58,087
我不知道 你为什么这么想
I don’t know where you get that.

324
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:01,191
你喜欢吗 这个好吗
Do you like it? Is it good?

325
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:04,734
我一直知道 你以后会拍东西
I always knew you’d be doing this 

326
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:06,627
因为你总是像个小导演
because you were always the little director. 

327
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:08,249
真的很有意思
It was hysterical. 

328
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:09,814
你就是镜头背后的男人
You were the man behind the camera.

329
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:10,777
好了
That’s it.

330
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:11,488
很奇怪吗
Isn’t that weird?

331
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:12,813
看看我的牙齿
It’s - Look at my teeth.

332
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:14,422
很高兴 看到你在做这些
I’m glad to see you’re doing it.

333
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,401
他们有了你和Ali
They had you and Ali. 

334
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,241
所以一开始 生活是很美好的
And, um… so, I think in the beginning it was very good. 

335
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:32,647
但是世事难料对吧 世事无常
But, you know, stuff happens, right? Things change.

336
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:37,315
这是关于Barbie被杀的纪录片
Is the documentary about Barbie being murdered, 

337
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:38,390
还是关于Barbie是谁的
or is the documentary about

338
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:39,808
纪录片
who Barbie was?

339
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:40,818
关于她是谁
Who she was.

340
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:41,552
是吗
Yeah?

341
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:43,811
那只是一部分
It’s, it’s about, I mean, that’s a part, 

342
00:15:43,915 --> 00:15:45,815
这是关于她的人生的 那是她
it’s about her life, and that is a part

343
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:47,659
人生中的一部分 然后
of her life, and then that…

344
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:49,724
这部纪录片 也是关于整个家庭的
it’s also kind of about the family, too.

345
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,061
她来了
There she is. 

346
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:04,598
白色内搭 紫色外套
Purple on white.

347
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:06,305
我不知道什么变了
I don’t know what had turned 

348
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,884
但有些事情变了
but something had turned. 

349
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,516
我记得有一次 我看着她
I remember looking at

350
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:13,076
她看起来 非常不同寻常
her one time and she looked so different, 

351
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:19,734
她好像很伤心 但又假装没事
she seemed hurt, like she was pretending. 

352
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,275
我能看出来 他们的感情 发生了变化
And I could tell that their relationship was different. 

353
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:25,125
后来我们去她家 看她的时候
And then when we would visit, 

354
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:26,708
Jeff都没在家里
Jeff wasn’t even there,

355
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:28,718
我们只是看到了 Barbie
it was just visiting Barbie.

356
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:29,998
我没有过问这件事
And I didn’t ask her about it, 

357
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:31,911
我没有过问这件事
I didn’t talk about it, 

358
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:33,855
很后悔我没有这样做
and I’m sorry I didn’t.

359
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:37,677
她遇到你爸爸的时候
I mean, she hadC was living such a privileged life 

360
00:16:37,784 --> 00:16:39,063
过着如此优渥的生活
when she met your father, 

361
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:41,412
你们也过着 如此优渥的生活
and you guys were living such a privileged life.

362
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:43,923
这是爸爸
There’s daddy. 

363
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:46,395
他是个很棒的人 很勤奋工作的人
What a wonderful man, and a hard worker.

364
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:50,163
但是你爸爸 
But your dad got in trouble, 

365
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,555
在南方电气工作时 惹了麻烦
when he was working at Southern Electric, and

366
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:57,127
因为他在海外非法交易
they fired him for making 

367
00:16:57,245 --> 00:17:00,390
公司解雇了他
an illegal deal out of the country,

368
00:17:01,383 --> 00:17:03,800
但他把他们 告上法庭
but he took them to court, and he

369
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:06,556
他应该是 以诽谤人格罪提起诉讼
won $3.5 million I believe, 

370
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:09,268
赢得了350美元赔偿金
for defamation of character.

371
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:13,406
也为了纪念 爸爸在法庭上打赢官司
It’s also dedicated to daddy’s victory, in court.

372
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:18,347
经历过在南方电气这些事情后
I think after what happened at Southern, 

373
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:21,863
他发生了变化
something changed him.

374
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,369
你妈妈总说 这对他打击很大
Your mom always said that that was such a blow to him. 

375
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:26,889
他总是试着
He was always trying to

376
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:29,757
通过各种商业冒险 证明自己
prove himself by doing other ventures. 

377
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:31,553
之后 当他开始旅行时
And then, when he started to travel, 

378
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:34,530
他就不回家了 那时候问题开始出现
and not come home, that’s when the problems began 

379
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,141
因为你妈妈 总是被孤零零丢在家里
because your mother was left alone all the time. 

380
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:40,242
她感觉自己 就像个单亲妈妈
And she was feeling like a single mother, 

381
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:42,912
她感觉自己
and, uh… she was feeling 

382
00:17:43,014 --> 00:17:44,358
好像被遗弃了
as though she had been deserted.

383
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,145
你爸爸 差不多就是抛弃了她
Your dad pretty much abandoned her, 

384
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,671
所以她提起离婚诉讼
so she filed for divorce. 

385
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:53,885
那对她来说
That was really a tough decision 

386
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:55,750
是个很艰难的决定
for her to make, you know?

387
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:59,457
你爸爸迁怒于你妈妈
The anger that your father had  over your mother

388
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:03,909
导致婚姻破裂 主要是因为他没有在物质上支持她
ending the marriage came out in not supporting her, physically. 

389
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:05,541
没有帮她 抚养孩子
Not giving child support, 

390
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,492
没有支付账单 没有处理
not paying for the bills, not taking care

391
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,403
任何家庭经济问题
of any of the financial, uh, 

392
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,805
有一部分开支 是他理应承担的
parts that he was supposed to take care of. 

393
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:14,849
他只想 让她倾家荡产
He just wanted to impoverish her;

394
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,386
这好像 就是他设定的目标
it seemed like a goal that he had set for himself.

395
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:21,860
看到发生的这一切 真的很让人难过
And it was very sad to see that all happen, 

396
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,145
因为他们还有 这么多
because there are so many more

397
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:26,433
美好的事情值得注意 而不是复仇和愤怒
wonderful things to focus on than revenge and anger.

398
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:28,775
再见 我爱你
Bye-bye! I love you.

399
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,289

Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

根据记录 屋主正是Jeffrey Hamburg

429
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:22,401
他们在那 也找不到他
They could not find him there as well. 

430
00:19:22,518 --> 00:19:23,511
跟我们交谈的邻居说
Now, the neighbors we talked 

431
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:25,629
Hamburg住在这栋公寓大楼
to say Hamburg lives in this condo complex,

432
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:27,627
他在这里 住了大概一年了
he’s lived in this unit here for about a year,

433
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,958
但是在一年时间里
though in that year-time, 

434
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,470
他们只见过他一次
they’ve only seen him once.

435
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,002
在门前台阶上 他的报纸没有被动过
On his front doorstep, the newspapers sit unread, 

436
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:34,962
这个地方的人 感到很惊讶
and the people in the area were surprised,

437
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,073
特别是当他们看到州警
especially when they saw the State Police come up

438
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,157
过来按前门铃 来找他的时候

439
00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:43,790

干了这件事
you think could have done this?

441
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:50,488
在我看来 如果她活下来
Well, it seems to me that your father 

442
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:54,524
你爸爸似乎是那个
was in the position to lose the most if she…

443
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:56,374
损失最大的人
if she lived. 

444
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:59,593
那天他本来应该去坐牢的
And, um, that was the day he was supposed to go to jail.

445

447
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:07,270
但那天听证会 她再也没出现过
but she never showed up for that court hearing.

448
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:09,212
这对夫妻 2005年离婚了
The couple divorced in 2005, 

449
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:11,029
之后很多年 存在法律纠纷
followed by years of legal wrangling,

450
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:13,608
他还欠孩子的抚养费
and he owed backCchild support.

451
00:20:14,397 --> 00:20:17,191
他一直不给钱
I mean, he had been withholding money. 

452
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,868
按照Barb对我说的 她要把他
From what Barb told me, she was going

453
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:21,042
送进监狱

457
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:29,547

while living a lavish lifestyle.

458
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:31,672

{\an8}Richard Callahan

I’ll tell you what I told the State Police that day. 

462
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:39,357
法院要求你爸爸
Your father had been ordered,

463
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,875
你爸爸也答应 给你们一些钱
and had promised to make certain payments.

464
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:44,486
你爸爸 要么带着钱来
Either your dad showed up with the money

465
00:20:44,565 --> 00:20:47,430
不然我就会通知法庭
or I’d be asking the court to find him

466
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:50,628
他蔑视法庭命令
in contempt of the court’s orders 

467
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:53,160
法院会把他关起来 直到他付钱为止
and incarcerate him until he, until he paid.

468
00:20:53,597 --> 00:20:55,247
他一共欠多少钱

and $324,000 to you and your sister. 

471
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:03,919
毫无疑问
There was no question 

472
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,115
他在3月3号 没拿出那笔钱
he did not have the money on March 3rd.

473
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:08,653
警方说Jeff Hamburg
Police say Jeff Hamburg was stealing money 

474
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,402
和Barbara离婚之后 四年来
from his daughter’s college fund

475
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:13,423
一直从自己女儿的大学基金中偷钱
about four years after he and his wife Barbara divorced.

476
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:15,695
那天什么时候开庭
What time did court start that day?

477
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,333
9点半
9:30. 

478
00:21:17,431 --> 00:21:20,201
一般你妈妈会在9点 9点15赶到
Normally, your mom’s there at 9, 9:15.

479
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,932
我爸爸 是什么样的举止
What was my dad’s demeanor like?

480
00:21:23,037 --> 00:21:24,146
我不知道这样说 合不合适
I don’t know whether I could say 

481
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,767
他的举止 当时发生了一些变化
there was a change in his demeanor,

482
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:29,466
但是他和他的律师
but there was no complaint to me 

483
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:32,009
都没有和我抱怨什么
from him or his lawyer saying, 

484
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:34,139
没有问"你客户在哪 为什么还没来"
"Where is your client, why isn’t she here?" 

485
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,773
这很让我惊讶
And that is what struck me. 

486
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:40,293
但我的话要说周全
But I should back up, because… 

487
00:21:40,362 --> 00:21:45,565
因为这好像在暗示 我知道你爸爸
that suggests that I-I know that your father…

488
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,526
做了什么 但是我并不知道
did something, which I do not know. 

489
00:21:48,637 --> 00:21:50,096
他只是因为那天的情况
He just was the prime suspect

490
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,118
被定性为头号嫌疑犯
because of the circumstances of that day.

491
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:58,396
所有父母都有梦想
All parents have dreams, 

492
00:21:58,491 --> 00:21:59,780
他们很明确
and they have definite ideas of

493
00:21:59,857 --> 00:22:01,895
想让你成为什么样的人
what they want you to be. 

494
00:22:02,095 --> 00:22:05,261
一位永不满足的父亲 让生活艰难
It isn’t easy with a father who is never satisfied, 

495
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:07,721
他总是想让你 与众不同
always wants you a little different,

496
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:10,735
更出众一点 更符合他的期望
and a little better, more like his dream.

497
00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:14,408
我遇到你的时候
From the time that I met you, 

498
00:22:14,477 --> 00:22:18,147
我 *你和你爸爸的关系并不好
the relationship with your dad, um, was not good. 

499
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,789
{\an8}Erin Corbett
我的高中心理辅导老师

500
00:22:18,264 --> 00:22:23,250
他很有控制欲

501
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,969
{\an8}生日快乐

502
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:27,856
我觉得 你和你妈妈很亲
I think you had a really close relationship with your mom,

503
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:31,327
可能比大多数少年和妈妈的关系都好
probably closer than most teenage boys.

504
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:34,450
在某些方面 你和同龄人一样
You were more like peers in some ways, 

505
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:36,052
所以她给你立规矩时
so you had a hard time

506
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:40,229
你感觉自己很难受
when she tried to lay down the law with you.

507
00:22:41,524 --> 00:22:43,683
你在嗑药
You were using substances and

508
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:46,109
然后被学校开除
you were expelled from school.

509
00:22:47,537 --> 00:22:50,417
你爸爸因为我写的一封信 大发雷霆
Your dad got angry about a letter I had written 

510
00:22:50,523 --> 00:22:53,281
我在写给法庭的信中 写道
to the court that stated that

511
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:56,616
你不想在他的房子里生活 不想去他家
you didn’t want to liveC go to his house. 

512
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,411
也不想 和他待在一起
Or be, spend time with him. 

513
00:23:00,516 --> 00:23:02,433
他觉得 那是我的一面之词
He thought that that was my opinion. 

514
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,010
我们澄清了事实
So, once we clarified really that 

515
00:23:06,122 --> 00:23:09,793
我其实 复述的是你的原话
I was stating something that you had stated, 

516
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:12,693
解释清楚了
it was cleared up. 

517
00:23:12,842 --> 00:23:17,597
但我收到了 他的律师发来的传票
But I got a- a subpoena from a lawy-from his lawyer.

518
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:20,405
对 我记得
Yeah, I remember it. 

519
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:22,286
他吓坏了
He, like, freaked out. 

520
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,813
他开始
He, like, started like

521
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,125
攻击你
attacking you, kinda.

522
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:27,080
然后你妈妈 第二天打来
And then your mom called me the next day, 

523
00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:30,673
告诉我 你很担心我
to tell me that you were worried

524
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,345
你不喜欢你爸爸
about me, that you didn’t like 

525
00:23:34,424 --> 00:23:36,340
这样对待我
the way your dad was treating me.

526
00:23:37,937 --> 00:23:40,509
你能说一下 谋杀案
Can you talk about afterC 

527
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:43,099
发生后几个月 是什么样的吗
like, months after the murder?

528
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,439
你来找我
You came to see me. 

529
00:23:45,536 --> 00:23:50,459
你离开了学校 但你回来找我
You left school and you came back to see me. 

530
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:53,905
不过只接受了几个疗程的治疗
Only for a few sessions though. 

531
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:57,458
因为你当时的状态
Because, you know, you were not in a place 

532
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,529
没办法正常上学
that you could function in school. 

533
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:02,221
你有点担心 自己的安全

之后不久 你就中断了

和你父亲的 所有联系
your dad stopped.

536
00:24:10,102 --> 00:24:14,153
我知道 你爸爸有些过去
I knew that there were things in your dad’s history.

537
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:16,902
嗨 够了
Hi! Enough!

538
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,167
你妈妈和我说过

539
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:22,790
他参与过国外的一些事情
involved in something overseas. 

540
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:25,892
我不知道他有多少护照 五个吗

541
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:29,689
我们很惊讶

542

从南方电气的总裁
To go from the CEO of Southern Electric

543
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:35,973
变成了鲜少有人了解的人

544

电气能源

在本月早些时候 被人谋杀

554
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:09,769
这位前夫 聘请了知名

555
00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:11,754
刑事辩护律师 Hugh Keefe

embezzlement, tax evasion, conspiracies.

561
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:23,088
你爸爸立刻聘请了 一名律师
Your father immediately got an attorney 

562
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:25,182
这样他就 不用被警方带走了
so that he wouldn’t have to go to the police. 

563
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:27,006
如果我有所隐瞒的话
If I thought I had something to hide, 

564
00:25:27,114 --> 00:25:29,024
我肯定不想 和警方谈话
I wouldn’t be wanting to talk to the police.

565
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:32,770
今天出庭的还有 警察
Also in court today: police.

566
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,578
这是一个例行的 多方听证会
This is a routine, ah, support hearing. 

567
00:25:35,688 --> 00:25:37,295
今天法庭里的警察
There are more police officers than

568
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:38,840
比律师还多
lawyers in that courtroom today.

569
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:40,846
警察遇到这样的情况时
The police, when they have a situation like this, 

570
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:43,491
会自然而然地 想到配偶或者前任
automatically look at the spouse or ex-spouse.

571
00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:46,688
你爸爸 聘请的律师
The attorney that your dad hired, 

572
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:48,598
在法庭里 让人们感到害怕
people were afraid of him in the courtroom. 

573
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:50,890
他控制力很强
He was pretty masterful.

574
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:52,507
Keefe说Hamburg上周 给了警方
Keefe says Hamburg gave police 

575
00:25:52,591 --> 00:25:55,309
一份他的 DNA和毛发样本
a sample of his DNA and hair last week.

576
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:57,221
肯定是所有检测结果都不匹配
I assume everything came back negative 

577
00:25:57,294 --> 00:25:59,022
否则他早就被逮捕了
or he would have been arrested.

578
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:00,847
出席今天离婚后听证会的还有

580
00:26:03,214 --> 00:26:04,540
你和Jeffrey聊过了吗
Have you spoken to Jeffrey at all?

581
00:26:04,635 --> 00:26:06,458
没有 我只知道这么多
No, I have not, and that’s all I have.

582
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:07,671
你的外甥和外甥女 还好吗
How’s your niece and nephew?

583
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:09,570
你觉得 警方为什么没有
Why do you think the police haven’t 

584
00:26:09,674 --> 00:26:12,444
就我父亲的情况立案
opened a case against my father about the murder?

585
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,963
我觉得警察
I think the police were... 

586
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:15,960
在处理你母亲的谋杀案时 失误了
dropped the ball on your mother’s murder, 

587
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:17,865
这就是事实
if you want the truth.

588
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,622
很难想象 在麦迪逊这样的小城
I mean, it’s very difficult to think of a small town,  like Madison,

589
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:28,190
警方无法破解这一惊人的罪行
not being able to solve this egregious crime. 

590
00:26:29,128 --> 00:26:31,413
感觉警察好像是 搞砸了
It sounds like there was a sort of screw-up

591
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:33,762
或者是DNA出了问题 我不太清楚
or something with the DNA, I’m not really sure.

592
00:26:30,362 --> 00:26:33,861
{\an8}警察母亲
有谋杀嫌疑

593
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:36,044
{\an8}谋杀发生日
2010年3月3日

594
00:26:37,852 --> 00:26:41,227
{\an8}康涅狄格开了一所新的 尸检实验室
2010年4月23日

595
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,237
他们让我们家人 等DNA检测结果
We were asked, as a family, to wait to run the DNA 

596
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:41,188
因为新建了 一所DNA实验室
because apparently there was a new DNA lab being built, 

597
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:43,740
那个实验室会是最棒的
and it was gonna be the best.

598
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,266
{\an8}康涅狄格尸检实验室

599
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,740
下午好 女士们先生们
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, 

600
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:47,658
很高兴来到梅里登
it is a pleasure to be here in Meriden

601
00:26:47,751 --> 00:26:49,563
庆祝州尸检实验室
to celebrate the groundbreaking

602
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:52,117
动土开工仪式
for the State Forensic Science Laboratory.

603
00:26:52,214 --> 00:26:54,572
众所周知 康涅狄格州
Connecticut is a known leader 

604
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,352
在尸检领域 是著名领先者
in the field of forensic science, 

605
00:26:56,445 --> 00:26:59,889
这个项目 将强化这样的优势
and this project will reinforce this distinction.

606
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:03,189
所以我们等着新DNA实验室建成
So we waited for this new DNA lab to be built.

607
00:27:03,774 --> 00:27:06,882
我们相信 它是全美国
We believe we are the premier laboratory 

608
00:27:06,983 --> 00:27:09,203
乃至全世界 最先进的实验室
in the United States and in the world...

609
00:27:09,318 --> 00:27:16,267
他们做了DNA检测 但试剂盒出了问题
They ran the DNA, and, um, the DNA kit was faulty.

610
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,893
{\an8}DNA证据提取需要数月

611
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:20,533
对方有罪或者无罪
...And the difference between verdicts of guilty 

612
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:23,912
很大程度上取决于
and verdicts of not guilty depends to a great extent 

613
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,242
我们这样的实验室能否公正无私
upon the integrity of a laboratory such as ours.

614
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:29,510
现在州犯罪实验室
Now the state crime lab is under 

615
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,083
现在被施加了 额外的压力
some extra pressure right now 

616
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:34,249
因为最近 对DNA检测过程的审查
because a recent audit of its DNA processes

617
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,074
发现了一些问题
came up with some problems

618
00:27:36,175 --> 00:27:39,912
它的认证资质也过期了
and its accreditation also has expired.

619
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:41,797
说实话 madison
To be quite honest with you, Madison, 

620
00:27:41,878 --> 00:27:44,136
我都不知道 有没有DNA保存下来
I don’t even know if there is any DNA left. 

621
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:46,626
这真是把我吓坏了
And it scares the shit out of me.

622
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:51,672
尸检结束后 她就被火化了
After the medical examiner finished, she was cremated. 

623
00:27:51,858 --> 00:27:54,511
这是家族传统
I mean, that’s a family tradition. 

624
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:56,993
早知道是这样
Knowing what I know now, 

625
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,744
我应该再多等一阵子
one should wait a little longer 

626
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:01,795
直到所有证据 在尸体火化前
until all evidence has been collected properly,

627
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,499
都收集完毕
before you cremate them,

628
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:06,587
因为现在DNA很重要了
because DNA is so important now.

629
00:28:10,926 --> 00:28:12,239
你还好吗
You alright? 

630
00:28:12,898 --> 00:28:14,141
抱歉 姥姥
I’m sorry Grammy.

631
00:28:14,252 --> 00:28:15,643
没事
Yeah.

632
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:18,640
有人漏掉了什么东西
Somebody’s missing something. 

633
00:28:21,572 --> 00:28:24,238
不用DNA也能破案的
Cases can be solved without DNA.

634
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,137
{\an8}谋杀案发生当日
2010年3月3日

635
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:26,360
麦迪逊警察局
There’s been some scuttlebutt about 

636
00:28:26,476 --> 00:28:29,366
出了一些流言蜚语 不怎么光彩
the Madison Police Department being less than ethical,

637
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:32,554
我觉得 需要调查一下
that, um, I think needs to be investigated.

638
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:35,243
{\an8}六名警察被辞退 警长被迫停职
2006-2009

639
00:28:34,164 --> 00:28:35,511
你也知道 州检察官
As you know, the State’s Attorney

640
00:28:35,594 --> 00:28:37,391
现在正在调查 麦迪逊警察局
now investigating the ongoings here 

641
00:28:37,473 --> 00:28:38,762
出现的各种事情
at the Madison Police Department.

642
00:28:38,846 --> 00:28:40,110
他们没有抓捕犯人
Instead of making arrests, 

643
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:42,573
两名警察反而被 逮了起来
two Madison police officers are placed under arrest.

644
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,063
三名警察被开除
Three police officers have been fired. 

645
00:28:45,153 --> 00:28:46,715
警察被控

646
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:48,895
招妓 光顾脱衣舞会
prostitutes, frequenting strip clubs 

647
00:28:48,973 --> 00:28:51,904
按摩院 还成立了摩托车帮派
and massage parlors, and establishing a motorcycle gang.

648
00:28:52,015 --> 00:28:55,603
咖啡店里 人们常谈的就是坏警察
Conversation at the coffee shop is often about bad cops.

649
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,335
人们有点厌倦了 警察局里
People here are tired of the little bit of corruption 

650
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:00,830
日渐猖獗的腐败问题
that keeps cropping up in the police department.

651
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:02,955
一名麦迪逊警官被剥夺了警徽
A Madison police officer is stripped of his badge.

652
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:06,062
因为滥用警局数据 被停职逮捕
...Suspended and arrested for abusing police data, 

653
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:08,098
被指控从餐厅偷海鲜

654
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:10,880
现在被控从镇上的加油站偷汽油
now accused of stealing gasoline from the town pump.

655
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:15,891
真是个问题 你需要信任的人
It's a concern when the people you trust to, 

656
00:29:17,198 --> 00:29:19,017
需要托付要事的人
um, to take care of things are less

657
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:21,768
自己本来就不诚实
than honest themselves. 

658
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:26,324
我没有证据 但是很担心
I have no proof of that, only a lot of concern.

659
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,349
这是你长大的地方
This is the town you will grow up in. 

660
00:29:32,469 --> 00:29:34,280
一个温暖美好的世界

找到自己在世界上的归宿

充满自信 发挥自己的才能

665
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:54,097
你好
Hello?

666
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,937

嘿 怎么了
Hey, what’s going on?

668
00:29:57,454 --> 00:29:59,349
{\an8}通话中
警探Neal Mulhern

669
00:29:57,579 --> 00:29:59,500
我之前和你说过
I told you before, I’m doing a documentary 

670
00:29:59,586 --> 00:30:01,626
我在拍一部 有关妈妈的纪录片
on my mother for a class...

671
00:30:01,705 --> 00:30:02,800
对
Yeah.

1
00:30:02,736 --> 00:30:04,332
我在想
{\fs22}Um, and I was just seeing, um,{\r}

2
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:09,332
有什么办法可以进行采访
{\fs22}if there is any way I could get an interview with someone,{\r}

3
00:30:09,388 --> 00:30:12,098
就是用一些
{\fs22}just about... just to go over like what the...{\r}

4
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:15,930
犯罪现场的内容 可以放在纪录片里
{\fs22}crime scene or something that I can use for my documentary.{\r}

5
00:30:16,587 --> 00:30:19,306
我得先和领导商量下
{\fs22}Um, I'l have to check with the chief,{\r}

6
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,808
也许他会愿意 这我不清楚
{\fs22}maybe he'd be willing to, it's beyond me, you know...{\r}

7
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,514
-好的  -他说了算 但是
{\fs22}-Okay. -He's the boss of bosses, but, I mean,{\r}

8
00:30:26,445 --> 00:30:29,029
你知道我们不能说得太细
{\fs22}you know we really can't get into much detail, you know?{\r}

9
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:30,704
-对  -我是说 问题是案件还在审理
{\fs22}-Right. -I mean, the problem is it's open.{\r}

10
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:32,643
如果我们开始公布任何细节
{\fs22}If we start releasing any details,{\r}

11
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:34,367
毕竟案子还在审理中
{\fs22}you know, it's an active case{\r}

12
00:30:34,412 --> 00:30:36,961
所以我们不能泄露出去
{\fs22}so we can't just give stuff out{\r}

13
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:39,272
因为这可能会给我们造成困扰
{\fs22}because it could come back to haunt us.{\r}

14
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:43,037
我们刚刚又对整个案件做了全面梳理
{\fs22}We just did another comprehensive review of the entire case again, um,{\r}

15
00:30:43,814 --> 00:30:46,601
-我们还要再跟很多人面谈  -好的
{\fs22}-we're going to be going back and interviewing a lot of people. -Okay.{\r}

16
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,461
你知道我们也有一些问题
{\fs22}And, uh, you know we have some questions{\r}

17
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,391
想问你
{\fs22}that have popped up for you, too.{\r}

18
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,980
好 你周五早上
{\fs22}Alright, um, Is there any way you could{\r}

19
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:55,305
能过来见我吗
{\fs22}come in and meet with me Friday morning?{\r}

20
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:56,930
是的 当然
{\fs22}Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.{\r}

21
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,458
好的
{\fs22}Okay.{\r}

22
00:31:00,856 --> 00:31:03,463
他不知道我们能否接受采访 但是
{\fs22}He doesn't know if we can do an interview, but like, what if...{\r}

23
00:31:05,752 --> 00:31:09,140
我周五要接受审问
{\fs22}I...I'm going in for questioning on Friday.{\r}

24
00:31:09,187 --> 00:31:11,339
我带录音机怎么样
{\fs22}What if I, like, brought in  a recorder?{\r}

25
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:13,294
这很冒险
{\fs22}Risky.{\r}

26
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:17,773
{\an8}制片人的声音


27
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:15,648
或者我可以用手机录下来
{\fs22}Or I could record it with my phone.{\r}

28
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:17,591
很冒险的
{\fs22}Risky.{\r}

29
00:31:19,117 --> 00:31:20,194
这是值得的
{\fs22}It'd be worth it.{\r}

30
00:31:20,783 --> 00:31:23,827
是的 看看他们在问你什么问题吧
{\fs22}Yeah, it would. See what kind of questions they're asking you.{\r}

31
00:31:22,974 --> 00:31:23,780
{\an8}距麦迪逊一英里


32
00:31:24,661 --> 00:31:26,936
{\an8}麦迪逊镇学校


33
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:55,443
{\an8}麦迪逊警察局


34
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:35,484
Madison 今天我们怎么来警局了
{\fs22}Madison, what brings us to the police station today?{\r}

35
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:39,779
我要接受审问
{\fs22}I am, uh, about to get interrogated,{\r}

36
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:45,530
这算是我所忍受的众多事情之一
{\fs22}it's just one of the many things that I have to put up with,{\r}

37
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:51,419
自从有人杀害了我母亲
{\fs22}since someone came and killed my mother.{\r}

38
00:32:02,665 --> 00:32:03,619
你好 需要帮忙吗
{\fs22}Hi, can I help you?{\r}

39
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:06,100
嘿 我来找Mulhern警探

44
00:32:09,612 --> 00:32:10,899
这是你的姓还是你的名
{\fs22}Is that your last name or your first name?{\r}

45
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:11,723
我的名
{\fs22}Uh, that's my first name.{\r}

46
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,476

49
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:16,129
好的 谢谢你
{\fs22}Okay, thank you.{\r}

50
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:24,324
我都不知道自己有没有准备好
{\fs22}I don't even know if I'm, like, prepared for this.{\r}

51
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:28,588
请坐
{\fs22}Have a seat.{\r}

52
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:31,549
你最近在忙什么
{\fs22}What you been up to?{\r}

53
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:34,588
{\an8}Christopher Sudock警探


54
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:56,469
{\an8}Neal Mulhern警探


55
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:34,549
没忙什么 就是学校的事
{\fs22}Um, not much, just like, school and stuff.{\r}

56
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,391
还在佐治亚州吗*
{\fs22}Still down in Georgia?{\r}

57
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,494
是的
{\fs22}Yeah.{\r}

58
00:32:37,261 --> 00:32:38,480
今天有什么事吗
{\fs22}So, what's up today?{\r}

59
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:40,404
你来找我们什么事吗
{\fs22}What're you looking for from us?{\r}

60
00:32:40,957 --> 00:32:44,519
我们只是想看看 能不能给一个采访的机会
{\fs22}Um, we're just seeing if there's any way we can get an interview?{\r}

61
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,865
现在还不行
{\fs22}Yeah, we're not, that's, you know,{\r}

62
00:32:46,904 --> 00:32:48,546
案子还没结 不能接受采访
{\fs22}with an open case they'l never let that happen.{\r}

63
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,742
还没到那一步
{\fs22}We're not there yet.{\r}

64
00:32:49,813 --> 00:32:52,147
这案子很棘手 确实很棘手
{\fs22}It's just a tough case. Tough case.{\r}

65
00:32:52,185 --> 00:32:55,416
你还记得你那天做了什么吗
{\fs22}Do you remember any more about what you did that day, or...?{\r}

66
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,458
我去了Chick-Fil-A快餐店*
I went to ChickCFilCA.

67
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,619
那天我没去上课 至少别人是这么告诉我的
{\fs22}I didn't go to class that day. Or so I'm told.{\r}

68
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:01,550
你记得那天有没有去便利店
{\fs22}Did you remember going to any convenience stores that day?{\r}

69
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:02,734
买烟
{\fs22}Cigarettes?{\r}

70
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:05,213
我当时在抽烟
{\fs22}I was still smoking.{\r}

71
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:08,253
肯定他们已经告诉你DNA的事了
{\fs22}I'm sure they've told you some of the DNA stuff.{\r}

72
00:33:08,698 --> 00:33:10,160
现场有一根香烟
{\fs22}Well, there's a cigarette there.{\r}

73
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,628
跟你父亲的DNA不匹配
{\fs22}Doesn't come back to your father.{\r}

74
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:15,143
跟我的匹配
{\fs22}Goes back to me?{\r}

75
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:15,906
是的
{\fs22}Yeah.{\r}

76
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:18,976
在你母亲的指甲里有DNA
{\fs22}There's DNA under your mother's fingernails.{\r}

77
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,248
我的吗
{\fs22}Of me?{\r}

78
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:22,527
Hamburg家族男性的
{\fs22}Male Hamburg lineage.{\r}

79
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:25,432
就你所知 你觉得是谁干的
{\fs22}With everything you know, who do you think did this?{\r}

80
00:33:25,705 --> 00:33:26,860
我不知道
{\fs22}I have no idea.{\r}

81
00:33:27,363 --> 00:33:29,013
我们不能排除你父亲的可能
{\fs22}We can't eliminate your father.{\r}

82
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:30,405
不能排除
{\fs22}We can't.{\r}

83
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,456
排除他的唯一办法是 他接受审讯
{\fs22}The only way we can eliminate him is him talking to us,{\r}

84
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:35,090
提供他那天的行踪
{\fs22}providing his whereabouts for that day.{\r}

85
00:33:35,128 --> 00:33:37,465
我们需要些证据 来排除他的嫌疑
{\fs22}Something we can verify to put him out of the picture.{\r}

86
00:33:37,794 --> 00:33:41,316
话虽如此 这并不能彻底排除他的嫌疑
{\fs22}With that said, that doesn't even eliminate him from involvement.{\r}

87
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:44,050
你比任何人都了解你父亲
{\fs22}You know your father better than anybody.{\r}

88
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:46,227
他会干出这种事吗
{\fs22}Is he capable of something like this?{\r}

89
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:49,941
我从没见过他对任何人有暴力行为
{\fs22}I've never seen him be violent towards anyone.{\r}

90
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:51,587
控制欲强吗
{\fs22}Controlling?{\r}

91
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:53,094
很强
{\fs22}He's very controlling.{\r}

92
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,491
还好指使人且自私自利
{\fs22}And manipulative. And selfish.{\r}

93
00:33:56,854 --> 00:33:58,972
你父亲欠你母亲一大笔钱
{\fs22}Your father owed your mother a huge amount of money.{\r}

94
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:01,111
是的 几十万吧
{\fs22}Yeah, hundreds of thousands of dollars.{\r}

95
00:34:01,574 --> 00:34:02,554
他的钱都干嘛用了
{\fs22}Where did all his money go?{\r}

96
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,138
这是我想知道的一个大问题
{\fs22}That's a big question I want to know.{\r}

97
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:07,391
你觉得你爸爸有海外银行账户吗
{\fs22}Do you think your dad has offshore bank accounts?{\r}

98
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,863
我不知道
{\fs22}I have no idea.{\r}

99
00:34:12,685 --> 00:34:16,582
{\an8}麦迪逊警察局


100
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:12,417
他在海外做什么 对我一直是保密的
{\fs22}It's...what he does overseas has always been a secret to me.{\r}

101
00:34:12,952 --> 00:34:16,293
我觉得目前最重要的问题是 过来 坐下来
{\fs22}The big problem I have is, come in and sit down,{\r}

102
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:18,256
洗清罪名
{\fs22}and clear your name.{\r}

103
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:22,741
我不能 我和他联系不多 知道的不多
{\fs22}I can't...I just...I don't have enough contact with him to know.{\r}

104
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:24,251
你和他没有联系了吗
{\fs22}You don't have contact with him anymore?{\r}

105
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,788
联系过 我跟他聊过 但是
{\fs22}No, I talk to him, but like,{\r}

106
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:31,148
心底里很难问他这样的问题
{\fs22}emotionally it's pretty hard to ask him questions like that.{\r}

107
00:34:32,014 --> 00:34:33,893
你跟他说纪录片的事了吗
{\fs22}Have you told him about the documentary?{\r}

108
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:36,659
说了 最近 因为我想采访他
{\fs22}Yeah, recently, because I wanted to interview him.{\r}

109
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:37,785
他怎么说的
{\fs22}What did he say about that?{\r}

110
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,685
他说 他真的很想帮我
{\fs22}He said, he really wants to help me{\r}

111
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:42,923
但他不知道自己能做什么
{\fs22}but he just doesn't know what he can do.{\r}

112
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:46,789
我猜是他律师说他不能去
{\fs22}I guess it's his lawyer, like, saying he can't.{\r}

113
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:49,024
是的 我让他跟他律师谈过很多次
{\fs22}Yeah, I've had him talk to his lawyer, like,{\r}

114
00:34:49,068 --> 00:34:52,410
也说了他可以和律师一起接受采访
{\fs22}many times, told I'l do an interview with his lawyer in the room,like,{\r}

115
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:55,726
我还在想办法采访他
{\fs22}I... I'm still working on getting an interview with him.{\r}

116
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,947
当你在拍纪录片时
{\fs22}When you're doing your documentary is it on video,{\r}

117
00:34:58,995 --> 00:34:59,880
你是录音吗
{\fs22}or is it a...Are you recording it?{\r}

118
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:00,745
会拍摄视频
{\fs22}It's a video.{\r}

119
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,170
你愿意把视频交给我们看吗
{\fs22}Is that something you'd be willing to turn over to us to look at?{\r}

120
00:35:03,622 --> 00:35:06,290
你知道 有时候人们会犹豫要不要跟警察聊
{\fs22}You know, sometimes people are hesitant to talk to the police,{\r}

121
00:35:06,324 --> 00:35:08,758
但他们很愿意告诉你一些
{\fs22}but they're more than willing to tell you something,{\r}

122
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:10,625
我们不知道的事
{\fs22}uh, that we don't know.{\r}

123
00:35:12,618 --> 00:35:15,550
你爸爸 他有没有直接告诉你
{\fs22}Your dad, has he ever point blank told you{\r}

124
00:35:15,586 --> 00:35:17,190
"我跟这事一点关系都没有"
{\fs22}"I had nothing to do with this?"{\r}

125
00:35:17,652 --> 00:35:19,605
我从来没有问过他
{\fs22}I've never, like, asked him.{\r}

126
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:21,378
我想问他呢
{\fs22}I want to ask him.{\r}

127
00:35:21,935 --> 00:35:24,809
我觉得这部纪录片是我唯一的机会 可以那样问他
{\fs22}This documentary is the only chance I feel like I can.{\r}

128
00:35:24,847 --> 00:35:26,902
如果我问他 我想当面问
{\fs22}If I ask him that, I want to do it in person.{\r}

129
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:31,362
我害怕那样问他
{\fs22}And it...it scares me to do that.{\r}

130
00:35:31,871 --> 00:35:35,141
如果有任何可能是他干的
{\fs22}If there's any possibility that he's capable of doing that,{\r}

131
00:35:35,662 --> 00:35:37,332
这会让我很害怕
{\fs22}it just scares the shit out of me.{\r}

132
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,653
进展如何
{\fs22}So how'd it go?{\r}

133
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:45,769
还好吧 他们什么都不想提供给我们
{\fs22}Uh, good. I mean, they don't want to give us anything,{\r}

134
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,654
但他们想要纪录片
{\fs22}but they want the doc.{\r}

135
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,690
-他们想要我们的纪录片  -你有没有告诉他们
{\fs22}-They want like all of our files. -Did you tell them...{\r}

136
00:35:51,254 --> 00:35:52,536
这对他们有什么帮助
{\fs22}What would it, what would it help them?{\r}

137
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,965
他们认为
{\fs22}They think that, like,{\r}

138
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:58,632
人们会在采访中 告诉我们一些不会对他们说的事
{\fs22}people would tell us things in interviews that they wouldn't tell them.{\r}

139

166
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:31,661
你想这案子破案吗
{\fs22}Do you, do you want this case to get solved?{\r}

167
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,752
Madison 我不想再回答你的问题了

{\fs22}If...I don't know if you care more{\r}

173
00:37:48,842 --> 00:37:52,764
你是否更想掩护自己
{\fs22}about covering yourself than this case being solved,{\r}

174
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:55,120
这没道理啊 因为这
{\fs22}which doesn't make any sense, because this, this,{\r}

175
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:56,913

182
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:16,539
Madison 这是你必须做的决定
{\fs22}Madison, that's a decision you have to make.{\r}

183

这决定由你来做
{\fs22}I mean, that's your decision.{\r}

188
