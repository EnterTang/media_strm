啊，你好啊，奈夫先生
Why, hello there, Mr. Neff.

5
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,960
工作到很晚啊，奈夫先生？
Working pretty late, aren't you, Mr. Neff? 

6
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,040
是很晚,上去吧
Late enough. Let's ride.

7
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,280
-你看来面色很差     -我没事
You look kind of all in, at that. I'm fine.

8
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,810
-保险生意如何，奈夫先生？   -很好
How is the insurance business, Mr. Neff? Okay.

9
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,490
他们不肯卖我保险
They wouldn't ever sell me any.

10
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,290
他们说我的心难以捉摸
They said I have something loose in my heart.

11
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,860
-我心脏确实不好    -是吗? 
I say it's rheumatism. Yeah?

12
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,990
12楼
Twelve.

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,410
办公室备忘录
Office memorandum.

14
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,420
沃特.奈夫致巴顿.基斯，索赔经理
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes, Claims Manager.

15
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,920
洛杉矶，1938年7月16日
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.

16
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,360
亲爱的基斯
Dear Keyes...

17
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,950
我猜你听到后会说这是招认
I suppose you'll call this a confession when you hear it.

18
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,400
其实，我不喜欢  "招认"  这词
Well, I don't like the word confession.

19
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,600
我只是想让你了解一些事情的真相
I just want to set you right about something you couldn't see...

20
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,370
毕竟你正在为之头疼
because it was smack up against your nose.

21
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,630
你以为自己是个一流索赔经理
You think you're such a hot potato as a Claims Manager...

22
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,900
能一眼看穿虚假索赔
such a wolf on a phony claim.

23
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,910
也许你确实是，但是看看迪崔克森的案子
Maybe you are, but let's take a look at that Dietrichson claim.

24
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,310
意外和双倍赔偿
Accident and double indemnity.

25
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,350
这事儿上你曾表现不错，基斯
You were pretty good in there for a while, Keyes.

26
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,250
你说那不是意外。说对了。
You said it wasn't an accident. Check.

27
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,090
你说那不是自杀。说对了。
You said it wasn't suicide. Check.

28
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,090
你说那是谋杀。说对了。
You said it was murder. Check.

29
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,760
你感觉十拿九稳了，是吗？ 
You thought you had it cold, didn't you?

30
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,030
真相用包装纸包裹，附加粉红蝴蝶结
All wrapped up in tissue paper, with pink ribbons around it.

31
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,630
堪称完美
It was perfect.

32
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,240
但却不是，因为你犯了个错
Except it wasn't, because you made one mistake...

33
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,210
只一个小小错误
just one little mistake.

34
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,250
到确定凶手的那步，你搞错了人
When it came to picking the killer, you picked the wrong guy.

35
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,920
你想知道是谁杀了迪崔克森？  
You want to know who killed Dietrichson?

36
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,620
拿稳你的廉价雪茄，基斯
Hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.

37
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,620
我杀了迪崔克森
I killed Dietrichson.

38
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,560
我，沃特.奈夫，保险推销员
Me, Walter Neff, insurance salesman.

39
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,770
35岁，未婚，没有前科
35 years old, unmarried, no visible scars...

40
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,030
直至不久之前，我是说
until a while ago, that is.

41
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,170
对，我杀了他
Yes, I killed him.

42
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,900
我杀他是为了钱...
I killed him for money...

43
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,570
和一个女人
and for a woman.

44
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,550
而我没得到钱，而我没得到那女人
And I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman.

45
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,380
很有趣，是吧？
Pretty, isn't it?

46
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,100
一切始于去年5月
It all began last May.

47
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,570
那是5月底了
Around the end of May, it was.

48
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,470
我去了格伦戴尔
I'd been out to Glendale 

49
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,880
送一些乳业卡车的保单
to deliver a policy on some dairy trucks.

50
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,050
回来路上  
On the way back 

51
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,440
我记起洛斯菲利大道有宗汽车续保的事
I remembered this auto renewal near Los Feliz Boulevard.

52
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,450
于是我开车过去
So I drove over there.

53
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,490
那是一幢那种十来年前人们热衷的...
It was one of those California Spanish houses...

54
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,460
加州-西班牙风格房子
everyone was nuts about 10 or 15 years ago.

55
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,960
这一幢一定让某人花了3万块
This one must've cost somebody about $30,000.

56
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,500
那是说，他已经付款完毕的话
That is, if he ever finished paying for it.

57
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,870
迪崔克森先生在吗？
Is Mr. Dietrichson in?

58
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,460
-谁要找他？    -我叫奈夫，沃特.奈夫
Who wants to see him? My name is Neff. Walter Neff.

59
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,150
如果你想推销...  
If you're selling something... 

60
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,770
你看，我是想跟迪崔克森先生谈...
Look, it's Mr. Dietrichson I want to talk to...

61
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,000
不是来收杂志费的
and it's not magazine subscriptions.

62
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,480
-听着，迪崔克森先生不在家     -他多久回来？  
Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not in. How soon do you expect him?

63
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,740
他回来时就回来了，这么说有用吗？
He'll be home when he gets here, if that's any help to you.

64
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,550
什么事，妮蒂？是谁？ 
What is it, Nettie? Who is it?

65
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,420
有人来找迪崔克森先生
It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

66
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,580
我是迪崔克森太太，什么事？ 
I'm Mrs. Dietrichson. What is it?

67
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,720
你好，迪崔克森太太
How do you do, Mrs. Dietrichson?

68
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,720
我是沃特.奈夫，太平洋保险的
I'm Walter Neff, Pacific All Risk.

69
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,960
-太平洋什么？   -太平洋保险公司
Pacific all what? The Pacific All Risk Insurance Company.

70
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,020
是汽车保险续保的事
It's about some renewals on the automobiles.

71
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,080
过去两星期里...
I've been trying to contact your husband 

72
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,660
我一直想联系你先生
for the past two weeks...

73
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,900
-但他从不在办公室    -我能做些什么？ 
but he's never in his office. Is there anything I can do?

74
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,460
保险15号到期
The insurance ran out on the 15th.

75
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,670
我不愿去想象...
I'd hate to think of your having a smashed fender...

76
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,370
您出什么状况却无任何保险...
or something while you're not...

77
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,700
这种情况
fully covered.

78
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,180
也许我明白您的意思，奈夫先生
Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr. Neff.

79
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,080
-我正在晒日光浴   -希望附近没鸽子
I've just been taking a sunbath. No pigeons around, I hope.

80
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,420
关于那些保单， 
About those policies, 

81
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,210
迪崔克森太太，抱歉打扰您，但是...
Mrs. Dietrichson, I hate to take up your time, but...

82
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,620
没关系
Oh, that's all right.

83
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,180
如果您能稍等我更衣，我马上下来
If you'll wait till I put something on, I'll be right down.

84
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,160
妮蒂，带奈夫先生到客厅
Nettie, show Mr. Neff into the living room.

85
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,160
客厅会在哪儿？  
Where would the living room be?

86
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,670
那里，但他们把酒锁起来了
In there, but they keep the liquor locked up.

87
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,730
没关系，我一向自有办法
It's all right. I always carry my own keys.

88
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,770
客厅依然充斥着...
The living room was still stuffy...

89
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,510
昨晚的雪茄气味
from last night's cigars.

90
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,540
窗户紧闭...
The windows were closed...

91
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,640
阳光从百叶窗透射进来...
and the sunshine coming in through the venetian blinds...

92
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,950
让空气中的尘埃显现
showed up the dust in the air.

93
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,020
钢琴上，几个精致相框里，  
On the piano, in a couple of fancy frames, 

94
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,920
是迪崔克森先生和萝拉...
were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...

95
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,220
他和第一位妻子的女儿
his daughter by his first wife.

96
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,730
他们有一缸那种小红金鱼...
They had a bowl of those little red goldfish...

97
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,200
放在大沙发后面的桌子上
on the table behind the big davenport.

98
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,630
但说实话，基斯
But to tell you the truth, Keyes...

99
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,730
我当时对金鱼毫无兴趣
I wasn't a whole lot interested in goldfish right then.

100
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,770
对汽车续保、迪崔克森先生和他女儿萝拉也是
Or in auto renewals, or in Mr. Dietrichson and his daughter Lola.

101
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,070
我一心想着楼上那女的
I was thinking about that dame upstairs, 

102
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,750
以及之前她看我的方式
and the way she had looked at me...

103
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,510
我想再见到她，近一些...
and I wanted to see her again, close...

104
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,310
而不是隔着那蠢楼梯
without that silly staircase between us.

105
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,030
-没让您久等吧？   -一点没有，迪崔克森太太
I wasn't long, was I? Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

106
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,590
-希望我脸色还好    -很完美，在我看来
Hope I've got my face on straight. It's perfect, for my money.

107
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,100
-你叫奈夫是吧？   -对  
Neff is the name, isn't it? Yeah.

108
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,460
两个F，像费城那样，如果你知道那故事...
With two "F's," like in Philadelphia, if you know the story.

109
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,100
-什么故事？     -费城故事啊
What story? The Philadelphia Story.

110
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,330
不如坐下，你谈谈保险的事
Suppose we sit down and you tell me about the insurance.

111
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,900
我丈夫什么也不告诉我
My husband never tells me anything.

112
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,340
是关于你们的两部车，那凯迪拉克和克莱斯勒
Well, it's on your two cars, the LaSalle and the Plymouth.

113
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,310
我们为迪崔克森先生负责这单保险...
We've been handling this insurance for Mr. Dietrichson 

114
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,810
已三年了
for three years...

115
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,410
我们不希望出现断供情况
and we'd hate to see the policies lapse.

116
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,620
你的脚链很别致啊，迪崔克森太太
That's a honey of an anklet you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

117
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,350
我刚说过，我们不希望保单断供
As I was saying, we'd hate to see the policies lapse.

118
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,290
当然 ， 
Of course, 

119
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,230
我们有三十天宽限期，最多了
we give them 30 days. That's all we're allowed to give.

120
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,790
我猜他是在长滩的油田那边太忙了
I guess he's been too busy down at Long Beach in the oil fields.

121
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,060
我能哪天晚上和他谈几分钟吗？ 
Couldn't I catch him at home some evening for a few minutes?

122
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,070
应该可以， 但他8点前很少回家
I suppose so. But he's never home much before 8:00.

123
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,470
我倒没问题
That's fine with me.

124
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,560
你和汽车俱乐部没关系吧？  
You're not connected with the Automobile Club, are you?

125
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,040
没，我是太平洋保险，怎么了？
No, the All Risk, Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

126
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,080
有个汽车俱乐部的人一直在找他
Somebody from the Automobile Club has been trying to get him.

127
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,980
-他们的性价比更好吗？   -如果你丈夫是会员的话
Do they have a better rate? If your husband's a member.

128
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,110
他不是
No, he isn't.

129
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,020
那，他得先加入会员
Well, then he'd have to join the club 

130
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,350
先交会员费
and pay the membership fee to start with.

131
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,120
我从不抢人买卖，迪崔克森太太
I never knock the other fellow's merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

132
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,280
汽车俱乐部服务很好  
The Automobile Club's fine. 

133
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,150
但我的服务也很好
I can do just as well for you, though.

134
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,420
我这份保单很有吸引力
I have a very attractive policy here.

135
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,640
两分钟都用不了...
It wouldn't take me two minutes 

136
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,160
就能向您丈夫解释明白
to put it in front of your husband.

137
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,790
举个例子，我们有个新规，撞车赔偿...
For instance, we're writing a new kind of 50% retention feature...

138
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,890
有50％保留额度
in the collision coverage.

139
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,870
你是个聪明的保险员，是吗？
You're a smart insurance man, aren't you, Mr. Neff?

140
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,500
-我已经入行11年     -干的不错？ 
Well, I've been at it 11 years. Doing pretty well?

141
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,940
够谋生了
It's a living.

142
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,240
你只做汽车保险还是全部都做？ 
You handle just automobile insurance, or all kinds?

143
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,420
全部。火灾险，地震险，盗窃险， 
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft, 

144
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,750
公共债务，集体保险...
public liability, group insurance...

145
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,250
工业事故等等，无所不包
industrial stuff and so on, right down the line.

146
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,650
意外保险？ 
Accident insurance?

147
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,950
意外保险？当然了，迪崔克森太太
Accident insurance? Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

148
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,090
希望您告诉我那脚链上刻的什么？
Wish you'd tell me what's engraved on that anklet.

149
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,050
-只是我的名字    -未请教？
Just my name. As, for instance?

150
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,360
-菲莉丝    -菲莉丝啊？ 
Phyllis. Phyllis, huh?

151
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,830
-我想我很喜欢  -但你不确定？
I think I like that. But you're not sure?

152
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,070
我得开上几圈才知道
I'd have to drive it around the block a couple of times.

153
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,870
奈夫先生，不如你明天晚上八点半左右来
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by tomorrow evening around 8:30?

154
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,810
-他会在家    -谁？
He'll be in then. Who?

155
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,110
我丈夫啊，你不是着急想跟他谈吗？ 
My husband. You were anxious to talk to him, weren't you?

156
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,080
是，曾经是，但我又觉得那不重要了...
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of getting over the idea...

157
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,520
如果你懂我意思  
if you know what I mean.

158
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,020
这个州可是限速啊，奈夫先生。每小时45英里
There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

159
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,360
-我时速多少，警官？    -我得说快90了
How fast was I going, officer? I'd say around 90.

160
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,060
我猜你要下摩托给我罚单啊
Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket.

161
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,360
我猜我这次就警告后放行吧
Suppose I let you off with a warning this time.

162
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,160
我猜我不会听警告 
Suppose it doesn't take.

163
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,600
我猜我会给你一拳
Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles.

164
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,570
我猜我会嚎啕大哭，趴在你的肩膀上
Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder.

165
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,770
我猜你会想趴在我丈夫肩膀上
Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder.

166
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,330
那拉倒吧
That tears it.

167
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,020
-明晚八点半     -那正是我说的
8:30 tomorrow evening then. That's what I suggested.

168
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,750
-你也会在家？    - 应该是，一般都会
Will you be here, too? I guess so, I usually am.

169
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,150
相同椅子，相同香水，相同脚链？ 
Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?

170
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,250
我不确定是否明白你的意思
I wonder if I know what you mean.

171
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,160
我不确定你是否真不确定
I wonder if you wonder.

172
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,230
那是个炎热的下午...
It was a hot afternoon and I can still remember...

173
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,240
至今我仍记得沿街金银花的味道
the smell of honeysuckle all along that street.

174
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,130
我怎么会知道谋杀有时...
How could I have known that murder can sometimes 

175
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,540
闻起来像是金银花？
smell like honeysuckle?

176
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,800
也许你会知道，基斯...
Maybe you would have known, Keyes...

177
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,510
当她提到意外险的时候，但我没意识到
the minute she mentioned accident insurance, but I didn't.

178
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,450
我心情愉快
I felt like a million.

179
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,420
我回办公室，看是否有邮件
I went back to the office to see if I had any mail.

180
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,990
就是有个英格伍德卡车司机
It was the day you had that truck driver 

181
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,780
来找你的那天
from Inglewood on the carpet.

182
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,150
记得吗，基斯？  
Remember, Keyes?

183
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,630
奈夫先生，基斯先生想见你
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes wants to see you.

184
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,590
他嚷着要找你一下午了
He's been yelling for you all afternoon.

185
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,630
他是不是只想找人发发火？  
Is he sore, or just frothing at the mouth a little?

186
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,720
帮我放好，好吗？
Park this for me, will you, sweetheart?

187
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,240
-嗨，沃特    -嗨，乔治
Hello, Walter. Hi, George.

188
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,470
拜托，戈罗皮
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.

189
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,410
你别想忽悠任何人
You're not kidding anybody with that line of bull.

190
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,540
-你走投无路了，你知道。  -那是你说的。  
You're in a jam and you know it. Says you.

191
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,840
-我只要我的钱。   -那是你说的
All I want is my money. Says you.

192
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,540
你只会招来警察。嗨，沃特
All you're gonna get is the cops. Hello, Walter.

193
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,780
-这是英格伍德来的山姆.戈罗皮    -我认识戈罗皮先生
This is Sam Garlopis from Inglewood. Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.

194
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,790
帮他写过卡车保单。你好吗，戈罗皮先生？  
Wrote a policy on his truck. How are you, Mr. Garlopis?

195
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,130
-我不好，卡车被烧了    -对，听着
I ain't so good. My truck burned down. Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.

196
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,370
我每个月都收到上百份索赔
Every month hundreds of claims come to this desk.

197
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,730
有些是假的，我一看就知道
Some of them are phonies, and I know which ones.

198
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,790
怎么知道？我的小人儿告诉我的
How do I know? Because my little man tells me.

199
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,910
-什么小人儿？   -在这里的小人儿
What little man? The little man in here.

200
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,740
每次一有虚假索赔出现  
Every time one of these phonies comes along, 

201
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,200
他就在我胃里打个结
it ties knots in my stomach.

202
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,710
我就吃不了饭
I can't eat.

203
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,030
你就是其中一个结
Yours is one of them, Garlopis. 

204
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,010
所以我知道你是虚假索赔
That's how I knew your claim was crooked.

205
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,610
那我怎么办了呢？ 
So what did I do?

206
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,280
下午我派了拖车去你车库...
I sent a tow car over to your garage this afternoon...

207
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,220
他们抬起了你那烧掉的卡车
and they jacked up that burned-out truck of yours.

208
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,810
他们发现了什么呢？  
And what did they find?

209
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,190
他们找到一堆碎屑的余烬
They found what was left of a neat pile of shavings.

210
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,820
什么碎屑？  
What shavings?

211
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,460
你浸过油，又扔上火柴的那些
The ones you soaked with kerosene and dropped a match on.

212
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,230
你看，先生，我只是个穷人，也许犯了错
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor guy. Maybe I made a mistake.

213
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,600
这算是一种说法
That's one way of putting it.

214
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,910
我感觉不好，基斯先生
I ain't feeling so good, Mr. Keyes.

215
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,210
这里，签了字你感觉就会好了
Here. Just a minute. Sign this and you'll feel fine.

216
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,150
-签什么？    -放弃索赔声明，这里
Sign what? It's a waiver on your claim. Right here.

217
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,750
-这里？   -这里
Here? Here.

218
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,520
现在你又有诚信了。 再见
Now you're an honest man again. Goodbye, Garlopis.

219
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,530
但我没卡车了
But I ain't got no more truck.

220
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,990
在我那片儿，2600是笔大钱
$2,600 is lot of dough where I live.

221
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,550
怎么了，戈罗皮？你不会开门吗？
What's the matter, Garlopis, don't you know how to open the door?

222
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,930
将手放在把手上，向左转动
Just put your hand on the knob, turn it to the left.

223
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,770
拉向自己
Now pull it toward you.

224
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,530
-对了     -谢谢，基斯先生
That's the boy. Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

225
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,170
我们算是干嘛的？  
What kind of an outfit is this, anyway?

226
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,420
是保险公司...
Are we an insurance company, 

227
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,980
还是一群门外汉...
or just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...

228
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,280
竟给这种人保险？ 
to write a policy on a mug like that?

229
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,980
等等，基斯，他不是我评估的
Now, wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate this beef.

230
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,610
我在戈罗皮的申请表上标注了...
I clipped a note to that Garlopis application...

231
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,680
同意他的申请之前...
to have him thoroughly investigated...

232
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,490
要做详细评估.     -我知道，沃特
before we accepted the risk. I know you did, Walter.

233
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,030
我不是针对你
I'm not beefing at you. 

234
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,220
我是说公司。他们做事的方式就是...
It's the company. It's the way they do things.

235
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,390
什么事也不做！
The way they don't do things!

236
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,550
就为了满足销售额
The way they'll write anything 

237
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,190
胡写乱填一通
just to get it down on the sales sheet.

238
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,760
而我就是那个...
And I'm the guy 

239
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
在这梗着脖子紧盯虚假索赔的人
that has to sit here up to my neck in phony claims...

240
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,460
来防止...
so they won't 

241
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,770
他们从窗户扔出去的钱比从门外带来的还多
throw more money out the window than they take in at the door.

242
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,670
这页揭过去，下个话题吧
Okay, turn the record over, let's hear the other side.

243
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,160
我受够了给一群...
Well, I get darn sick of trying to 

244
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,070
口若悬河的销售员擦屁股了
pick up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen...

245
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,840
他们能蠢到将人身险卖给...
dumb enough to sell life insurance to a guy...

246
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,780
和四条响尾蛇睡一个被窝的人
who sleeps in the same bed with four rattlesnakes.

247
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,460
沃特，我干这个26年了，我告诉你...  
Walter, I've had 26 years of this and let me tell you, 

248
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,440
我变的...
I'm getting...

249
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,480
你每分钟都乐在其中，基斯
Yeah, and you've loved every minute of it, Keyes.

250
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,770
你爱这行当  
You love it, 

251
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,390
你只是太紧张了，你和你的小人儿
only you worry about it too darn much, you and your little man.

252
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,790
你太过谨慎行事，会把自己搞疯的
You're so darn conscientious, you're driving yourself crazy.

253
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,420
你不看日历来确定...
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday 

254
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,590
都不敢说今天是周二
unless you looked at the calendar.

255
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,960
然后你还得检查那是今年的...
Then you'd check to see if it was this year's 

256
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,260
还是去年的日历
or last year's calendar.

257
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,730
你还得研究日历是哪里印的
Then you'd find out who printed the calendar...

258
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,070
看他们是否...
and find out if their calendar 

259
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,600
能对上世界标准日历
checked with the World Almanac's calendar.

260
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,860
够了,沃特
Now, that's enough from you, Walter.

261
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,170
在我扔桌子砸你之前，快滚
Now, get out of here before I throw my desk at you.

262
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,200
我也爱你
I love you, too.

263
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,180
我是说真的，你这老家伙...
I really did, too, you old crab...

264
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,550
总是大叫大嚷，对人呼来喝去
always yelling your head off, always sore at everybody.

265
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,420
但你这些花招从来都骗不了我
But you never fooled me with your song and dance. Not for a second.

266
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,960
可以说我一直知道，在你那满是烟灰的马甲之后...
I kind of always knew that behind the cigar ashes on your vest...

267
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,430
你有颗房子那么大的心
you had a heart as big as a house.

268
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,550
我回到办公室，电话有留言 
Back in my office there was a phone message 

269
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,660
迪崔克森太太的
from Mrs. Dietrichson...

270
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,460
关于续保
about the renewals.

271
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,740
她又不让我第二天晚上去了
She didn't want me to come tomorrow evening.

272
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,500
想让我周四下午3点半去
She wanted me to come Thursday afternoon at 3:30 instead.

273
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,310
我周四下午日程排的满满的
I had a lot of stuff lined up for that Thursday afternoon...

274
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,350
包括得去趟圣塔莫妮卡
including a trip down to Santa Monica...

275
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,180
去推销一些集体保险
to see a couple of live prospects about some group insurance.

276
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,350
但我总是想着菲莉丝.迪崔克森
But I kept thinking about Phyllis Dietrichson...

277
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,960
和那脚链戴在她腿上的样子
and the way that anklet of hers cut into her leg.

278
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,060
嗨，奈夫先生，你不进来吗？ 
Hello, Mr. Neff. Aren't you coming in?

279
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,700
我在考虑
I'm considering it.

280
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,910
希望你别介意我改了时间
I hope you didn't mind my changing the appointment.

281
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,950
-昨晚不太方便     -没关系
Last night wasn't so convenient. That's all right.

282
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,110
反正我只是在弄我的集邮册
I was working on my stamp collection anyway.

283
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,340
我在弄冰茶，你要一杯吗？ 
I was just fixing some iced tea. Would you like a glass?

284
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,680
好，除非你有多余的啤酒
Yeah, unless you've got a bottle of beer that's not working.

285
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,350
也许有，我从不知道冰箱里有什么
There may be some. I never know what's in the icebox.

286
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,620
妮蒂
Nettie.

287
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,220
关于续保，奈夫先生，我跟丈夫谈过了
About those renewals, Mr. Neff. I talked to my husband about it.

288
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,030
-是吗？   -对，他说他会续保
Oh, you did? Yes. He'll renew with you, he told me so.

289
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,660
事实上，我以为他今天下午在家
As a matter of fact, I thought he'd be here this afternoon.

290
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,900
-但他不在？    -不在
But he's not? No.

291
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,660
真可惜
That's terrible.

292
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,300
妮蒂
Nettie!

293
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,670
哦，我忘了，今天女佣放假
Oh, I forgot, today's the maid's day off.

294
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,650
不用啤酒了，冰茶也行
Never mind the beer. Iced tea will be fine.

295
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,020
-柠檬？糖？     -按你的来吧
Lemon? Sugar? Fix it your way.

296
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,910
既然女佣放假， 
As long as it's the maid's day off, 

297
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,280
也许我能帮你做点什么。
maybe there's something I can do for you.

298
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,520
-例如吸尘。  -有趣
Like running the vacuum cleaner. Fresh.

299
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,400
我以前推销过吸尘器
I used to peddle vacuum cleaners.

300
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,400
赚得不多，但能学到很多人生哲理
Not much money, but you learn a lot about life.

301
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:13,160
我觉得那在课堂上可学不到
I didn't think you'd learned it from a correspondence course.

302
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,940
你在哪里养成喝茶的习惯？ 
Where'd you pick up this tea drinking?

303
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,200
-你不是英国人吧？     -不，我是加州人
You're not English, are you? No. Californian.

304
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,340
在洛杉矶土生土长
Born right here in Los Angeles.

305
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,510
他们说加州本地人都来自爱荷华
They say all native Californians come from Iowa.

306
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,110
-奈夫先生，我...     -叫我沃特
Mr. Neff, I... Make it Walter, huh?

307
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,050
-沃特     -是的
Walter. That's right.

308
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,690
告诉我，沃特  
Tell me, Walter, 

309
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,820
卖出保险后，你拿多少提成？
on this insurance, how much commission do you make?

310
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,490
20％，怎么了？  
Twenty percent. Why?

311
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,190
我想也许我能再给你点生意
I thought perhaps I could throw a little more business your way.

312
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,860
-我不嫌多啊      -我想起我丈夫
I can always use it. I was thinking about my husband.

313
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,330
我很担心他在油田的工作
I worry a lot about him down in those oil fields.

314
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,700
-工作性质很危险    -身为管理人员不会吧？ 
It's very dangerous. Not for an executive, is it?

315
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,170
他不只是坐办公室
He doesn't just sit behind a desk.

316
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,540
他要跟钻油人员到油田
He's right down there with those drilling crews.

317
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,840
这令我担心不已
It's got me worried sick.

318
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,240
你是说，钻油塔可能倒了砸到他？  
You mean, some dark night a crown block might fall on him?

319
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,780
-请别这么说    -就这么回事啊
Please don't talk like that. But that's the idea.

320
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,840
有一次一根管子击中了工头
The other day a casing line snapped and caught the foreman.

321
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,720
-他脊椎骨折住院了    -真糟糕
He's in the hospital with a broken back. That's bad.

322
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,280
我想起来就觉得不安
It's got me jittery just thinking about it.

323
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,590
如果我丈夫也遇上这种事呢
Suppose something like that happened to my husband.

324
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,350
有可能
It could. Well...

325
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,030
-你不认为他应该买意外险吗？   -嗯
don't you think he ought to have accident insurance? Mmm-hmm.

326
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,400
他买哪种险合适？  
What kind of insurance could he have?

327
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,700
足够支付医疗费用的都行
Enough to cover doctors and hospital bills.

328
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,830
例如每周125现金保障
Say $125 a week cash benefit.

329
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,310
最高赔偿达5万元
And he'd rate around $50,000 capital sum.

330
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,640
-最高赔偿？什么意思？     -如果他死了  
Capital sum? What's that? In case he gets killed.

331
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,850
也许我不该这么说
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

332
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,280
我猜你做这一行要想得面面俱到
I suppose you have to think of everything in your business.

333
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,750
你丈夫会理解的
Well, your husband would understand.

334
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,600
我觉得我可以让他考虑...
I'm sure I could sell him on the idea of 

335
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,620
购买意外险
some accident protection.

336
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,250
不如我跟他谈谈？ 
Why don't I talk to him about it?

337
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,480
你可以试试，但他很固执
You could try, but he's pretty tough-going.

338
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,650
人们起初都很固执
They're all tough at first.

339
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,690
他头脑很复杂
He has a lot on his mind.

340
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,490
他不懂什么是倾听...
He doesn't seem to want to listen to anything...

341
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,400
除了收音机里的棒球赛
except maybe a baseball game on the radio.

342
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,850
有时候我们坐个整晚
Sometimes we sit here all evening 

343
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,670
相互之间却不吐一字
and never say a word to each other.

344
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,400
-听起来挺沉闷      -我只是坐这织毛衣
Sounds pretty dull. So, I just sit and knit.

345
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,110
你嫁他是为了这个吗？  
Is that what you married him for?

346
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,340
也许我喜欢他手持毛线的样子
Maybe I like the way his thumbs hold up the wool.

347
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,080
如果他的手累了...
Anytime his thumbs get tired...

348
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,520
有我在，你不用织什么毛衣
Only, with me around, you wouldn't have to knit.

349
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,680
-不用吗？     -你尽管放心，不用
Wouldn't I? You bet your life, you wouldn't.

350
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,190
加点朗姆酒也许更好一点
Wonder if a little rum would get this up on its feet.

351
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,790
我想问你件事，沃特
I want to ask you something, Walter.

352
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,830
我能够不去打扰他...
Could I get an accident policy for him 

353
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,630
而给他买份意外险吗？
without bothering him at all?

354
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,730
再说一次？
How's that, again?

355
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,500
这对你也更容易了 
It would make it easier for you, too. 

356
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,780
你都不用和他谈了
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.

357
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,370
我有点私房钱
I have a little allowance of my own.

358
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,640
我可以付款，他不用知道这事
I could pay for it and he needn't know anything about it.

359
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,280
为什么他不用知道？  
Why shouldn't he know?

360
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,750
因为他不想要意外险
Because he doesn't want accident insurance.

361
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,290
他对此有点迷信 
He's superstitious about it. 

362
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,760
很多人都是。真有趣，对吗？
A lot of people are. That's funny, isn't it?

363
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,740
如果能那样办的话
If there was a way to get it like that, 

364
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,990
能省掉不少麻烦
all the worry would be over.

365
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,020
-懂我意思吗，沃特？    -当然，我眼睛雪亮
See what I mean, Walter? Sure. I got good eyesight.

366
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,830
你是说，你希望他在不知情的情况下拥有保险
You mean you want him to have the policy without him knowing it.

367
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,920
那意味着，他不知情这事...
And that means without the insurance company knowing 

368
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,930
保险公司那边也不能知道
that he doesn't know it.

369
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,800
-是这么设想的吧？   -有什么问题吗？ 
That's the setup, isn't it? Is there anything wrong with it?

370
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,210
没有，我看很好
No, I think it's lovely.

371
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,410
然后，如果某个雨夜，
Then, if some dark, wet night, 

372
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,710
那钻油塔确实砸向他...
that crown block did fall on him...

373
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,840
什么钻油塔？  
What crown block?

374
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,820
但有时钻油塔自己办不到  
Only sometimes it can't quite make it on its own, 

375
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,010
它得需要一点帮助
it has to have a little help.

376
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,410
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

377
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,920
当然，不一定非是钻油塔
Of course, it doesn't have to be a crown block.

378
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,050
也可能是汽车撞了他
It can be a car backing over him, 

379
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,080
也可能从楼上窗口坠楼
or he could fall out of the upstairs window.

380
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,250
诸如此类，下面就是太平间接手了
Any little thing like that, just so it's a morgue job.

381
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,560
-你疯了？    -没那么疯
Are you crazy? Not that crazy.

382
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,360
-再见，迪崔克森太太    -怎么了？  
Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson. What's the matter?

383
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,330
听着宝贝，你没法全身而退
Look, baby, you can't get away with it.

384
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,800
你想干掉他，不是吗？
You want to knock him off, don't you?

385
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,340
你太含血喷人了
That's a horrible thing to say.

386
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,700
你以为我是什么人? 
What'd you think I was, anyway?

387
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,350
直接走进...
A guy that walks into 

388
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,140
一个漂亮少妇家的客厅然后说：
a good looking dame's front parlor and says:

389
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,180
“下午好，我给做丈夫的卖意外险”
"Good afternoon, I sell accident insurance on husbands.

390
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,510
“您对您丈夫厌烦了吗？” 
"You got one that's been around too long?

391
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,240
“是不是想将他变成钱？”
"One you'd like to turn into a little hard cash?

392
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,220
“对我笑一个 ，我就帮你搞定”
"Just give me a smile and I'll help you collect. "

393
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,950
-你认为我是蠢蛋啊    -我认为你是坏蛋
Boy, what a dope you must think I am. I think you're rotten.

394
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,220
我认为你很棒，只要我不是你丈夫
I think you're swell, so long as I'm not your husband.

395
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,230
-给我滚    -不用你说
Get out of here. You bet I'll get out of here, baby.

396
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,490
我会走的，尽快
I'll get out of here, but quick.

397
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,910
我态度坚决，直截了当
So I let her have it straight between the eyes.

398
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,500
我没上当，这次没有
She didn't fool me for a minute, not this time.

399
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,210
我知道这是个烫手山芋
I knew I had hold of a red-hot poker...

400
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,010
必须在烫烂我的手之前扔掉
and the time to drop it was before it burned my hand off.

401
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,020
我停在汽车餐厅，要了瓶啤酒
I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of beer, 

402
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,650
这半天一直想喝的
the one I had wanted all along...

403
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,120
现在更想了
only I wanted it worse now, 

404
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,590
来除掉她那冰茶的味道
to get rid of the sour taste of her iced tea...

405
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,560
以及和它有关的一切
and everything that went with it.

406
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,010
我不想回办公室
I didn't want to go back to the office 

407
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,820
就去了三街和西街...
so I dropped by a bowling alley...

408
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,420
的保龄球馆，打了几局...
at Third and Western and rolled a few lines...

409
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,590
使自己分散注意力
to get my mind thinking about something else for a while.

410
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,700
走时我没胃口吃饭
I didn't feel like eating dinner 

411
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,670
也不想去什么娱乐
when I left, and I didn't feel like a show.

412
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,140
于是开车回家，停车，上楼
So, I drove home, put the car away and went up to my apartment.

413
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,380
天开始下雨，我眼看天色渐黑
It had begun to rain outside and I watched it get dark...

414
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,510
却连灯都没开
and didn't even turn on the light.

415
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,380
那也对我毫无帮助
That didn't help me either.

416
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,280
我心乱如麻
I was all twisted up inside...

417
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,190
烫手山芋还在我手里捧着
and I was still holding on to that red-hot poker.

418
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,000
当时我才意识到
And right then it came over me 

419
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,320
我还一点都没走出来
that I hadn't walked out on anything at all.

420
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,860
那诱惑太过强烈...
That the hook was too strong...

421
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,490
我和她之间还没有结束
that this wasn't the end between her and me.

422
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,230
反而才刚刚开始
It was only the beginning.

423
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,470
所以，8点门铃响起...  
So at 8:00 the bell would ring 

424
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,740
我不假思索就知道来人是谁
and I'd know who it was without even having to think.

425
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,740
好像这是最自然不过的事
As if it was the most natural thing in the world.

426
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,450
嗨，你今天下午忘拿帽子
Hello. You forgot your hat this afternoon.

427
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,880
-是吗？     -不想让我拿进来吗？  
Did I? Don't you want me to bring it in?

428
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,710
好
Sure.

429
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,220
放椅子上
Put it on the chair.

430
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,400
-你怎么知道我住址？    -电话薄
How'd you know where I live? It's in the phone book.

431
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,000
-正在下雨    -对
It's raining. Yeah.

432
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,940
脱下外衣坐下吧
Peel off your coat and sit down.

433
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,100
你丈夫出去了？ 
Your husband out?

434
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,170
对，长滩，要建一座新井
Yes. Long Beach. They're spudding in a new well.

435
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,410
他说晚点回来，大约9点半
He phoned he'd be late. About 9:30.

436
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,780
该说你很高兴见到我了吧？
It's about time you said you were glad to see me.

437
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,290
我知道你不会那样就拉倒的
I knew you wouldn't leave it like that.

438
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,350
-哪样？     -今天下午那样
Like what? Like it was this afternoon.

439
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,070
我一定是说错话
I must have said something 

440
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,720
让你严重误会了
that gave you a terribly wrong impression.

441
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,700
你千万不能那么看我，沃特
You must never think anything like that about me, Walter.

442
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,030
-好的     -不好
Okay. No, it's not okay.

443
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,930
-如果你不信我就不好    -你想让我怎样？  
Not if you don't believe me. What do you want me to do?

444
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,630
我想你对我好一些
I want you to be nice to me.

445
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,930
像你第一次来我家那样
Like the first time you came to the house.

446
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,240
回不去了
It can't be like the first time.

447
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,110
-发生了一些事    -我知道
Something's happened. I know it has.

448
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,680
在我们之间
It's happened to us.

449
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,210
我觉得他在盯着我，但不是出于关心
I feel as if he was watching me. Not that he cares. Not anymore.

450
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,530
他勒住我让我无法呼吸
He keeps me on a leash so tight I can't breathe.

451
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,120
他不是在长滩吗？放松
He's in Long Beach, isn't he? Relax.

452
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,520
也许我不该来
Maybe I oughtn't to have come.

453
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,290
-也许不该     -你想我走？  
Maybe you oughtn't. You want me to go?

454
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,670
-如果你想     -现在？  
If you want to. Right now?

455
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,030
当然，现在...
Sure, right now.

456
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,550
-我为你疯狂，宝贝     -我也为你疯狂，沃特
I'm crazy about you, baby. I'm crazy about you, Walter.

457
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,350
你头发上的香水，叫什么名字？  
That perfume on your hair. What's the name of it?

458
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,390
我不知道，我在昂塞纳达买的
I don't know. I bought it in Ensenada.

459
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,660
你应该喝点那种玫瑰红葡萄酒来搭配
You ought to have some of that pink wine to go with it.

460
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,630
起泡的那种，但我只有波本
The kind that bubbles. All I got is bourbon.

461
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,670
波本也行啊，沃特
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

462
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,580
拿两个杯子，好吗？
Get a couple of glasses, will you?

463
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,160
-加苏打水？    -白水，谢谢
Club soda? Plain water, please.

464
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,050
知道吗？ 六个月前...
You know, about six months ago 

465
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,020
有人在浴缸里踩肥皂滑倒
a guy slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub...

466
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,430
摔晕了然后淹死了
and knocked himself cold and was drowned.

467
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,870
而他买了意外险
Only he had accident insurance.

468
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,460
他们验尸了，她就没跑掉
So they had an autopsy and she didn't get away with it.

469
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,630
-谁没跑掉？    -他老婆
Who didn't? His wife.

470
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,210
还有个男的被枪打死的保险案子
Then there was a case of a guy who was found shot.

471
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,650
他老婆说他在擦枪  
His wife said he was cleaning a gun 

472
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,510
不小心打中肚子
and his stomach got in the way.

473
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,210
最后她得到3平米大的监狱单间
All she collected was a three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

474
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,080
也许她觉得值得
Perhaps it was worth it to her.

475
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,920
看你能不能拿到客厅
See if you can carry that as far as the living room.

476
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,890
这地方不错，谁替你收拾？ 
It's nice here, Walter. Who takes care of it for you?

477
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,560
一个黑人妇女每周来打扫两次
A colored woman comes in a couple of times a week.

478
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,700
-自己做早饭吗？    -有时榨点橙汁
Cook your own breakfast? Squeeze a grapefruit once in a while.

479
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,710
-其余的在街角杂货店买    -听起来不错
Get the rest down at the corner drugstore. Sounds wonderful.

480
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,500
周围仅有陌生人
Just strangers beside you.

481
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,280
你不认识他们 就不会恨他们
You don't know them and you don't hate them.

482
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,970
你不用早上坐在餐桌...
You don't have to sit across the table...

483
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,600
向着他和他女儿微笑...
and smile at him and 

484
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,240
日复一日的
that daughter of his every morning of your life.

485
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,580
什么女儿？ 钢琴上的女孩？ 
What daughter? You mean the little girl on the piano?

486
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,680
萝拉，她跟我们同住
Lola. She lives with us.

487
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,280
他替她想的更多
He thinks a lot more of her than he does of me.

488
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,090
-你想过离婚吗？    -他不会同意离婚
You ever think of a divorce? He wouldn't give me a divorce.

489
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,590
我猜是因为他得付笔钱
I suppose because it'd cost him too much money.

490
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,220
他没什么钱，自从做油田生意以来
He hasn't got any money. Not since he went into the oil business.

491
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,060
但你嫁给他时他很有钱？  
But he had when you married him?

492
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,660
是的。而我只想要一个家，不行吗？  
Yes, he had. And I wanted a home. Why not?

493
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,140
但那不是唯一原因。我是他老婆的看护
But that's not the only reason. I was his wife's nurse.

494
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,680
她长期卧病  
She was sick a long time. 

495
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,800
她死去时，他非常绝望
When she died, he was terribly broken up.

496
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,340
-我同情他      -现在却恨他
I pitied him so. And now you hate him.

497
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,310
是的，沃特，他对我很刻薄
Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me.

498
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,210
每次我买件衣服买双鞋
Every time I buy a dress or a pair of shoes 

499
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,350
他喉咙都得吼破
he yells his head off.

500
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,150
他哪儿也不让我去，不让我说话
He never lets me go anywhere. He keeps me shut up.

501
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,920
一直对我很刻薄
He's always been mean to me.

502
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,890
连他的人身保险受益人也是他女儿
Even his life insurance all goes to that daughter of his.

503
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,100
-那个萝拉。   -屁也没给你？  
That Lola. Nothing for you at all?

504
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,600
没，因为我对他来说屁都不是
No. And nothing is just what I'm worth to him.

505
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,800
所以你在黑暗中躺着
So you lie awake in the dark 

506
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,070
听着他呼噜声，有了念头
and listen to him snore and get ideas.

507
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,140
沃特，我没想杀他，从来没想
Walter, I don't want to kill him. I never did.

508
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,540
就算他喝醉了打我耳光
Not even when he gets drunk and slaps my face.

509
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,440
-只是你有时恨不得他去死    -也许
Only sometimes you wish he was dead. Perhaps I do.

510
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,970
然后你希望那是个意外，  
Then you wish it was an accident, 

511
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,250
而你手握那份5万元的保单
and you had that policy for $50,000.

512
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,850
-是吗？    -也许
Is that it? Perhaps that, too.

513
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,120
一晚我们开车从派对回家，他又醉了
The other night we drove home from a party. He was drunk again.

514
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,710
他开进车库时， 
When we drove into the garage, 

515
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,030
就那么坐在那里头倒在方向盘...
he just sat there with his head on the steering wheel...

516
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,830
汽车还没熄火
and the motor still running.

517
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,900
我当时想，若我不熄火，就这么关门走了，
And I thought what it would be like if I didn't switch it off...

518
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,340
把他留在那里，将会如何
just closed the garage doors and left him there.

519
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,570
我来告诉你会如何
I'll tell you what it'd be like.

520
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,940
如果你买了意外险  
If you had that accident policy 

521
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,240
然后让一氧化碳办事儿
and tried to pull a monoxide job...

522
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,410
我们公司有个叫基斯的
We've got a guy in our office named Keyes.

523
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,680
骗局对他来说  
For him a setup like 

524
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,480
像传说中的小菜一碟
that'd be just like a slice of rare roast beef.

525
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,380
3分钟内他就知道不是意外
In three minutes he'd know it wasn't an accident.

526
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,550
10分钟内你到了警局审讯室
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting under the hot lights.

527
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,790
半小时内你就在认罪书上签字了
In a half-hour you'd be signing your name to a confession.

528
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,690
但，沃特，我没干啊，也不会干
But, Walter, I didn't do it and I'm not going to do it.

529
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,030
只要牵涉保险公司就不能干
Not if there's an insurance company in the picture, baby.

530
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,190
他们的把戏比一群猴子加起来还多
They know more tricks than a carload of monkeys.

531
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,760
如果牵涉到死人，他们立马吊死你
And if there's a death mixed up in it, you haven't got a prayer.

532
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,900
就像10个一角能换一元一样确定
They'll hang you just as sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar.

533
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,260
而我不想你被吊死，宝贝
And I don't want you to hang, baby.

534
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,250
别再想了，好吗？
Stop thinking about it, will you?

535
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,480
于是我们就坐着，
So we just sat there.

536
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,440
她开始温柔哭泣，如同窗上雨滴  
She started crying softly, like the rain on the window, 

537
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,910
而我们未发一言
and we didn't say anything.

538
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,990
也许她已经不再想了，但我还在想...
Maybe she had stopped thinking about it, but I hadn't.

539
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,280
我没法不想
I couldn't.

540
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,390
因为这与我多年来的...
Because it all tied up with something 

541
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,800
一个想法联系起来
I'd been thinking about for years.

542
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,590
远在我遇到菲莉丝.迪崔克森之前
Since long before I ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

543
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,540
你应该明白，基斯
Because you know how it is, Keyes.

544
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,230
干这行，你总废寝忘食的...
In this business you can't sleep...

545
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,140
去试图识破别人给你的诡计
for trying to figure out all the tricks they could pull on you.

546
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,670
你就像站在轮盘后的庄家
You're like the guy behind the roulette wheel...

547
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,040
盯紧客人，避免他们连场子都骗走
watching the customers to make sure they don't crook the house.

548
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,790
然后突然一夜，你在想
And then one night, you get to thinking 

549
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,780
自己如何骗走场子
how you could crook the house yourself.

550
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,370
如何做得精明
And do it smart.

551
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,540
因为轮盘你已尽在掌握
Because you've got that wheel right under your hands.

552
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,750
其中机关一清二楚
You know every notch in it by heart.

553
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,510
你发现你只需一个搭档
And you figure all you need is a plant out front.

554
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,660
一个实施赌局的托
A shill to put down the bet.

555
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,820
而门铃突然响起
And suddenly the doorbell rings...

556
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,330
整个布局来到你的房间里了
and the whole setup is right there in the room with you.

557
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,260
基斯，我不是想为自己推脱
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying to whitewash myself.

558
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,700
我抵抗过，但我猜我抵抗不够坚决
I fought it, only I guess I didn't fight it hard enough.

559
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:05,010
赌注是5万块，以及一个男人的性命
The stakes were $50,000, but they were the life of a man, too.

560
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,380
一个没得罪过我的人，除了...
A man who'd never done me any dirt, except...

561
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,680
他娶了一个她毫不在乎的女人
he was married to a woman he didn't care anything about.

562
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,450
却是我在乎的
And I did.

563
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,600
你会打给我吗？沃特？ 
Will you phone me? Walter?

564
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,310
我恨他，我讨厌回去
I hate him. I loathe going back to him.

565
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,310
-你相信我，是吗沃特？    -我当然相信
You believe me, don't you, Walter? Sure I believe you.

566
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,280
我受不了。吊死又有什么可怕？
I can't stand it anymore. What if they did hang me?

567
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,690
他们不会吊死你的，宝贝
They're not going to hang you, baby.

568
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,310
吊死也比这样好
It's better than going on this way.

569
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,550
他们不会吊死你的，因为...
They're not gonna hang you because...

570
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,420
你会下手而我会帮你
you're gonna do it and I'm gonna help you.

571
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,190
-你知道自己在说什么吗？  -我当然知道...
Do you know what you're saying? Sure, I know what I'm saying.

572
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,750
我们会下手，而且要做得漂亮
We're gonna do it and we're gonna do it right.

573
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,960
-而我知道门道    -沃特，你在伤害我
And I'm the guy that knows how. Walter, you're hurting me.

574
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,830
不会有丝毫差错  
There's not going to be any slip-up. 

575
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,030
毫无破绽，无懈可击
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.

576
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,540
完美无暇
It's got to be perfect.

577
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,910
明天打给我，别用家里座机，去电话亭
Call me tomorrow. But not from your house. From a booth.

578
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,850
时刻小心自己举动
And watch your step every single minute.

579
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,000
必须天衣无缝，明白吗？ 
This has got to be perfect, you understand? 

580
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,050
彻头彻尾
Straight down the line.

581
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,290
彻头彻尾
Straight down the line.

582
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,530
就是这样，基斯
That was it, Keyes.

583
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,630
机器开始运作，势不可挡
The machinery had started to move and nothing could stop it.

584
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,780
第一步...
The first thing we had to do 

585
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,800
设计让他买意外险
was fix him up with that accident policy.

586
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,680
我知道他不肯  
I knew he wouldn't buy, 

587
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,010
但我只需他在申请表上签名
but all I wanted was his signature on an application.

588
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,360
所以我要让他在不知签的是什么...
So I had to get him to sign without his knowing 

589
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,580
的情况下签名
what he was signing.

590
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,060
还另需一个证人  
And I wanted another witness 

591
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,660
和菲莉丝一起，听见我向他推销
besides Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.

592
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,160
我在试着用你的脑袋思考，基斯...
I was trying to think with your brains, Keyes...

593
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,360
因为我得准备好所有答案
because I wanted all the answers ready...

594
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,130
面对你在迪崔克森死后
for all the questions you were gonna spring 

595
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,930
提出的所有问题
as soon as Dietrichson was dead.

596
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,470
几天后，我去了他们家
A couple of nights later I went to the house.

597
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,590
一切顺利 ， 
Everything looked fine, 

598
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,300
但我不喜欢菲莉丝带来的证人
except I didn't like the witness Phyllis had brought in.

599
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,870
是迪崔克森先生的女儿萝拉
It was Dietrichson's daughter, Lola.

600
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,440
情况令我心里有些别扭
And it made me feel a little queer in the belly...

601
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,560
就让她那么坐在房间
to have her sitting right there in the room, 

602
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,580
玩着跳棋
playing Chinese checkers...

603
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,250
好像不会发生任何事情
as if nothing were going to happen.

604
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,820
你应该知道，迪崔克森先生
I suppose you realize, Mr. Dietrichson...

605
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,190
由于你不是雇员
that, not being an employee...

606
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,560
你不受州赔偿保险条例保障
you are not covered by the State Compensation Insurance Act.

607
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,400
你保护自己的唯一办法
The only way you can protect yourself is 

608
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,930
就是买个人保险
by having a personal policy of your own.

609
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,160
对 ，我都懂
Yeah, I know all about that.

610
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,700
你接下来会说我需要...
The next thing you'll tell me I need...

611
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:17,300
地震险，雷电险，冰雹险
earthquake insurance and lightning insurance and hail insurance.

612
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,100
如果我们买下所有险种...
If we bought all the insurance they can think up...

613
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,970
就成穷光蛋了，不是吗宝贝？
we'd stay broke paying for it, wouldn't we, honey?

614
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,420
令我们成穷光蛋的是你
What keeps us broke is you going out 

615
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,910
一出去就买五顶帽子
and buying five hats at a crack.

616
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,680
在加州用帽子干嘛？  
Who needs a hat in California?

617
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,440
一分钱一分货，迪崔克森先生
Dollar for dollar, Mr. Dietrichson...

618
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,950
意外险是价钱最便宜的保险
accident insurance is the cheapest coverage you can buy.

619
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,890
下次谈吧，奈夫先生，我今天很累
Well, maybe some other time, Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.

620
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,050
那好吧
Just as you say.

621
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,920
要不今晚先解决汽车保险的事吧
Suppose we just settle that automobile insurance tonight.

622
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,220
好
Sure.

623
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,400
那件事只需您签名
All we'll need on that is for you to sign 

624
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,860
来申请续保
the application for renewal.

625
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,830
菲莉丝，不玩了你不介意吧？
Phyllis, do you mind if we don't finish this game?

626
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,270
-我觉得很无聊     -有别的可做吗？  
It bores me stiff. Got something better to do?

627
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,600
是的
Yes, I have.

628
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,700
父亲，我现在走行吗？  
Father, is it all right if I run along now?

629
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,900
-去哪里？跟谁？     -只是安妮，去滑旱冰
Run along where? Who with? Just Anne. We're going roller-skating.

630
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,740
-哪个安妮？     -安妮.马修斯
Anne who? Anne Matthews.

631
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,780
不会又是那个尼诺.扎切提吧？
It's not that Nino Zachetti again, is it?

632
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,250
最好别是扎切提
It better not be that Zachetti guy.

633
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,540
如果我抓到你和那...
If I ever catch you with that...

634
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,980
是安妮.马修斯，告诉你了
It's Anne Matthews, I told you.

635
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,150
也告诉你了是滑旱冰
And I also told you we're going roller-skating.

636
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,410
我约了她在
I'm meeting her 

637
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,320
维蒙特和富兰克林交界西北角见面
at the corner of Vermont and Franklin, the northwest corner...

638
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,860
如果你有兴趣的话。而我已经晚了
in case you're interested, and I'm late already.

639
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,490
我希望够清楚了。晚安，父亲
I hope that's all quite clear. Good night, Father.

640
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,930
-晚安，菲莉丝         -晚安，迪崔克森小姐
Good night, Phyllis. Good night, Miss Dietrichson.

641
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,990
-对不起，晚安...      -奈夫
I'm sorry. Good night, Mr... Neff.

642
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,730
晚安，奈夫先生
Good night, Mr. Neff.

643
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,740
人小鬼大呀
A great little fighter for her weight.

644
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,240
请你在这里签名，迪崔克森先生
Now, if you'll just sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.

645
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,710
-签什么？    -汽车续保申请
Sign what? The applications for the auto renewals.

646
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,750
您就能在新保单发出前得到保障了
So you'll be covered until the new policies are issued.

647
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,510
-那得何时？    -大约一星期
When will that be? About a week.

648
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,520
那我驾车往北时会得到保障
Just so I'm covered when I drive up north.

649
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,420
-旧金山？      -帕洛阿尔托
San Francisco? Palo Alto.

650
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,220
他是斯坦福毕业，奈夫先生
He was a Stanford man, Mr. Neff.

651
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,720
仍每年出席校友会
And he still goes to his class reunion every year.

652
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,370
那有什么问题？ 
What's wrong with that? 

653
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,350
我不能开心一下吗，哪怕一年才一次？
Can't I have a little fun, even once a year?

654
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,090
斯坦福的足球很厉害
Great football school, Stanford.

655
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
-你踢足球吗，迪崔克森先生？     -左卫
Did you play football, Mr. Dietrichson? Left guard.

656
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,860
-几乎入选校队。签哪里？  
Almost made the varsity, too. Where do I sign?

657
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,270
那条线
The bottom line.

658
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,930
-两份都签      -签两次？
Both copies, please. Sign twice, huh?

659
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,310
对，一份是业务员的
Yes. One is the agent's copy.

660
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,340
-我自己要存档     -存档，两份，三份，真麻烦
I need it for my files. Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

661
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,550
谢谢，迪崔克森先生
Thank you, Mr. Dietrichson.

662
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,830
别担心支票  
Don't worry about the check, 

663
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,460
我改天去你办公室取
I can pick it up at your office some morning.

664
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,760
-要多少钱?    -147.5元
How much you taking me for? $147.50.

665
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,520
我觉得今晚说够了保险的事了，奈夫先生
I think that's enough insurance for one evening, Mr. Neff.

666
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,790
足够了
Plenty.

667
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,960
上来时给我带些苏打水  
Bring me some soda when you come up, 

668
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,360
菲莉丝。  晚安，奈夫先生
Phyllis. Good night, Mr. Neff.

669
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,460
晚安，迪崔克森先生
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.

670
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,130
你的帽子在走廊，奈夫先生
I think you left your hat in the hall, Mr. Neff.

671
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,450
晚安，奈夫先生
Good night, Mr. Neff.

672
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,320
-好了吗，沃特？   -好了
All right, Walter? Fine.

673
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,300
-他签了，是不是？    -当然，你亲眼看见
He signed it, didn't he? Sure he signed it. You saw him.

674
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,300
现在听着，去帕洛阿尔托的事，他何时出发？  
Now, listen. That trip to Palo Alto. When does he leave?

675
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,360
月底
End of the month.

676
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,420
-开车去？     -一向都是
He drives, huh? He always drives.

677
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,130
这次不行，你要让他坐火车
Not this time. You're gonna make him take the train.

678
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,760
-为什么？     -因为坐火车会更完美
Why? Because it's all worked out for a train.

679
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,210
听着宝贝，每桩意外险都会有个条款...
Listen, baby. There's a clause in every accident policy...

680
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,140
叫做双倍赔偿
a little thing called double indemnity.

681
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,900
算是保险公司给顾客
The insurance companies put it in 

682
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,110
的额外优惠
as a sort of come-on for the customers.

683
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,340
意思是他们在特定事故时会付双倍
That means they pay double on certain accidents.

684
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,040
那种几乎不会发生的事故
The kind that almost never happen.

685
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,610
比如说，顾客在火车上死亡
Like for instance, if a guy is killed on the train...

686
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,120
他们就会付10万而不是5万
they pay $100,000 instead of $50,000.

687
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,620
-我明白了   -我们要做到极限
I see. We're hitting it for the limit, baby.

688
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,220
所以必须是火车
That's why it's got to be the train.

689
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,360
他会坐火车的，沃特，就像你需要的
It'll be the train, Walter. Just the way you want it.

690
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,330
彻头彻尾
Straight down the line.

691
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,310
嗨，奈夫先生
Hello, Mr. Neff.

692
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,950
是我
It's me.

693
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,060
-有什么事？    -我在等你
Is anything wrong? I've been waiting for you.

694
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,220
等我？为什么？
For me? Why?

695
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:01,590
我想让你捎我一段，如果顺路
I thought you could let me ride with you, if you're going my way.

696
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,190
-你走哪条路？    -下山，去维蒙特
Which way would that be? Down the hill. Down Vermont.

697
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,270
当然，维蒙特街与富兰克林街西北角，是吗？  
Sure. Vermont and Franklin. Northwest corner, wasn't it?

698
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,670
没问题，迪崔克森小姐
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

699
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,080
去溜冰？  
Going roller-skating, huh?

700
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,580
-你喜欢溜冰？   -溜不溜都行
You like roller-skating? I can take it or leave it.

701
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,660
-但今晚不会溜？    -是的  
Only tonight you're leaving it? Yes, I am.

702
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,690
我在家里很难熬
I'm having a very tough time at home.

703
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,130
我爸不懂我，菲莉丝恨我
My father doesn't understand me and Phyllis hates me.

704
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:40,090
-听起来真糟      -所以我得偶尔撒谎
Sounds tough, all right. That's why I have to lie sometimes.

705
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,570
你是说不去维蒙特街与富兰克林街 ？ 
You mean it's not Vermont and Franklin?

706
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,570
地点倒是真的
It's Vermont and Franklin all right.

707
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,770
但不是安妮.马修斯，而是尼诺.扎切提
Only it's not Anne Matthews. It's Nino Zachetti.

708
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,910
你不会告发我，对吧？  
You won't tell on me, will you?

709
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,710
-我要考虑一下     -尼诺不是我爸说的那么差
I'd have to think it over. Nino's not what my father says at all.

710
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,880
他只是运气差，他在南加州大学读医科
He's just had bad luck. He was doing premed at USC...

711
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,920
晚上在剧院做引座员
and working nights as an usher in a theater downtown.

712
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,650
因为学分不足而被退学
Got behind in his credits, flunked out.

713
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:05,750
然后与上司顶嘴被解雇，他太鲁莽
Then he lost his job for talking back. He's so hot-headed.

714
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,260
代价真大，不是吗？
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?

715
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,820
我爸大概认为没人配得上他女儿
Guess my father thinks nobody's good enough for his daughter...

716
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,130
除了标准石油公司老板
except maybe the guy that owns Standard Oil.

717
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,970
我希望他理解我，我不能放弃尼诺
I wish he'd see it my way. I can't give Nino up.

718
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,570
船到桥头自然直，迪崔克森小姐
It'll all straighten out, Miss Dietrichson.

719
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,300
我想会吧  
I suppose it will sometime. 

720
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,810
就是这里，奈夫先生
This is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

721
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,010
尼诺？过来，尼诺
Nino? Over here, Nino.

722
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,250
-这是奈夫先生，尼诺...     -你好，尼诺
This is Mr. Neff, Nino. Hello, Nino.

723
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,960
我大名扎切提
The name is Zachetti.

724
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,690
尼诺，别这样，奈夫先生送我来的
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave me a ride from the house.

725
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,860
我告诉了他我们的事
I told him all about us.

726
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,300
何必要告诉他？  
Why does he have to get told about us?

727
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,360
不用担心奈夫先生
We don't have to worry about Mr. Neff, Nino.

728
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,000
我不是担心
I'm not doing any worrying.

729
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,370
只是别四处张扬
Just don't you broadcast so much.

730
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,170
你怎么回事，尼诺？ 
Well, what's the matter with you, Nino?

731
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,740
-他是朋友     -我没有朋友
Why, he's a friend. I don't have any friends.

732
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,080
就算有，我喜欢自己选择
If I did, I like to pick them myself. Come on.

733
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,480
听着，她要搭车，我就捎她一段而已 
Look, sonny, she needed a ride, so I brought her along.

734
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,710
有什么不好吗？  
Is that anything to get tough about?

735
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,260
好了，萝拉，决定吧，你来不来？  
All right, Lola, make up your mind. Are you coming or aren't you?

736
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,120
当然来
Of course I'm coming.

737
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,960
别介意他，奈夫先生，谢谢载我一程
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff. And thanks a lot for the ride.

738
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,360
你真好。  尼诺？  
You're awfully sweet. Nino?

739
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,470
她是个好女孩
She was a nice kid.

740
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,710
他可能也比表面上好一些
Maybe he was a little better than he sounded.

741
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,060
但当时
But right then 

742
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,210
想起我身后的公文包...
it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all...

743
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,130
和里面她父亲的签名...
with that briefcase right behind my head 

744
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,980
以及签名的含义时
that had her father's signature in it...

745
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,180
我浑身不自在
and what that signature meant.

746
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,480
签名的含义是他离死不远了
It meant he was a dead pigeon.

747
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,620
那只是时间问题，而且时间不长了
It was only a question of time, and not very much time at that.

748
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,420
知道洛斯菲利兹的大市场吗，基斯？  
You know that big market up on Los Feliz, Keyes?

749
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,720
那是菲莉丝和我挑选的碰头处
That's the place Phyllis and I had picked for a meeting place.

750
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,890
我脑中计划已经成型
I already had most of the plan in my head...

751
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,270
但好多细节仍需理清
but a lot of details had to be worked out.

752
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,900
而日子到时她必须了然于心
And she had to know them all by heart when the time came.

753
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,940
从今我们必须小心翼翼
We had to be very careful from now on.

754
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,710
不能让人看见我们一起
We couldn't let anybody see us together.

755
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,680
连通电话也不行
We couldn't even talk to each other on the telephone.

756
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,620
至少不能用双方座机
Not from her house or at my office, anyway.

757
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,790
所以她每天上午11点去市场
So she was to be in the market every morning about 11:00, 

758
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,620
买些东西
buying stuff.

759
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,290
而我需要时可以在那里碰到她
And I could sort of run into her there any day I wanted to.

760
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,690
装作偶然
Sort of accidentally on purpose.

761
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,060
-沃特，我想...      -别那么大声
Walter, I wanted to... Not so loud.

762
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,200
我从昨天起就想和你谈谈
I wanted to talk to you, ever since yesterday.

763
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,400
-让我先说，事情已搞定
Let me talk first. It's all set.

764
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,960
意外险批下来了，保单在我口袋里
The accident policy came through. I've got it in my pocket.

765
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,980
支票我也拿到，我在油田见过他
I got his check, too. I saw him down in the oil fields.

766
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,170
他以为支付的是汽车保险
He thought he was paying for the auto insurance.

767
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,390
支票抬头只写了保险公司
The check's just made out to the company, 

768
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,110
所以支付什么都行
so it could be for anything.

769
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,980
但你得寄出一张汽车保险支票，明白吗？
But you have to send a check for the auto insurance, see?

770
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,310
那就没问题了  
It'll be all right that way, 

771
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,110
因为其中一辆车在你的名下
because one of the cars is in your name.

772
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,950
打开包，快点
Open your bag. Quick.

773
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,530
你能打开保险箱吗？  
Can you get in the safe-deposit box?

774
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,590
-能，我俩都有钥匙     -好
Yes. We both have keys. Fine.

775
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,960
但先别放保单进去，我再告诉你时间
But don't put the policy in there yet. I'll tell you when.

776
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,140
记住，你从没见过它，更没碰过它  
Remember, you never saw it, you never even touched it, 

777
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,170
明白吗？
you understand?

778
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,430
-我不是傻瓜      -好的，他何时搭火车？  
I'm not a fool. Okay. When is he leaving on the train?

779
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,980
-问题就在这，他不去了     -什么？ 
That's just it. He isn't going. What?

780
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,940
我一直想说的就是这事，行程取消了
That's what I've been trying to tell you. The trip is off.

781
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,600
发生什么事？ 
What happened?

782
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,180
先生，可以帮我拿那包婴儿食品吗？ 
Mister, could you reach me that package of baby food?

783
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,910
上面那一包？
That one up there?

784
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,690
真不懂干吗老把我需要的放顶层
I don't know why they always put what I want on the top shelf.

785
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,650
继续说，我在听
Go ahead. I'm listening.

786
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,090
他从油井掉下，腿断了，打了石膏
He had a fall-down at the well. Broke his leg. It's in a cast.

787
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,890
-腿断了？     -现在怎么办，沃特？  
Broke his leg? What do we do now, Walter?

788
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,590
-只有等了     -等什么？  
Nothing. We just wait. Wait for what?

789
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,140
等他能搭火车
Until he can take the train.

790
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,430
我说过必须是火车
I told you it's got to be the train.

791
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,840
但我们不能等， 我受不了了
But we can't wait. I can't go on like this.

792
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,100
听着，我们不能只图快
Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer 

793
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,900
不能拿个锤子就把他砸死
and do it quick, just to get it over with.

794
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,740
-还有其他办法    -我们不用其他方法
There are other ways. We're not gonna do it other ways.

795
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,900
但我们不能就此拉倒
But we can't leave it like this.

796
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,040
如果他发现意外险的事
What do you suppose would happen 

797
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,920
你觉得会发生什么？
if he found out about the accident policy?

798
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,040
很多事，但比站在死刑场上好
Plenty. But not as bad as sitting in that death house.

799
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,750
别这么说话  
Don't ever talk like that. 

800
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,920
别就此失去理智，就这样
Don't let's start losing our heads, that's all.

801
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,180
不是理智，我们在失去勇气
It's not our heads. It's our nerve we're losing.

802
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,430
借过
Excuse me.

803
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,120
我们一定要做的完美，我一直在说
We're gonna do it right. That's all I said.

804
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,690
是等待让我难过
It's the waiting that's getting me.

805
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,240
我也一样难过，宝贝
It's getting me just as bad, baby.

806
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,330
-但我们一定得等     -也许是，但，沃特...
But we've got to wait. Maybe we have, Walter, only...

807
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,870
没有你日子很难过，好像我们之间有一道墙
it's so tough without you. It's like a wall between us.

808
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,980
我得走了，宝贝。我无时无刻不想念你
I better go, baby. I'm thinking of you every minute.

809
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,580
那之后整整一周，我再没见她
After that, a full week went by and I didn't see her once.

810
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,150
我试着忘记她，和整个计划
I tried to keep my mind off her and off the whole idea.

811
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,530
我不断告诉自己
I kept telling myself 

812
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,130
是我的所谓宿命
that maybe those Fates they say watch over you...

813
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,930
弄断了他的腿，给我一条出路
had gotten together and broken his leg to give me a way out.

814
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,990
那天是6月15日，你或者记得，基斯
Then it was the 15th of June. You may remember that date, Keyes.

815
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,740
你下午3点左右来我的办公室
You came into my office around 3:00 in the afternoon.

816
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,710
嗨，基斯
Hello, Keyes.

817
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,010
我刚从诺顿办公室回来
I just came from Norton's office.

818
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,570
半年度营业报告公布了
The semiannual sales records are out.

819
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,100
你是最佳销售员，沃特  
You're high man, Walter. 

820
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,550
连续第二次了，恭喜
That's twice in a row. Congratulations.

821
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,320
-谢谢    有兴趣喝一杯吗？  
Thanks. How would you like a cheap drink?

822
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,880
有兴趣减薪50元吗?  
How would you like a $50 cut in salary?

823
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,220
-我应该现在就笑还是等等？   -我说真的
Do I laugh now or wait till it gets funny? No, I'm serious.

824
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,030
我刚跟诺顿谈过  
I've just been talking to Norton. 

825
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,590
我的文件堆积如山
Too much stuff piling up on my desk.

826
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,990
工作压力太大
Too much pressure on my nerves.

827
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,090
半晚上在辗转反侧
I spend half the night walking up and down in my bed.

828
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,070
我得有个助手，于是想到你
I've got to have an assistant and I thought of you.

829
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,530
我？为什么找我？  
Me? Why pick on me?

830
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,130
那，我有个离奇的想法，觉得你很合适
Well, because I've got a crazy idea you might be good at the job.

831
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,610
是很离奇，我是个销售员
That's crazy, all right. I'm a salesman.

832
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,870
对 ，你长袖善舞 ，能文能武
Yeah. A peddler, a gladhander, a backslapper.

833
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,710
做销售员实在太浪费
You're too good to be a salesman.

834
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,910
没人做销售员会浪费
Nobody's too good to be a salesman. Phooey!

835
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,070
你们的工作就是按门铃  
All you guys do is just ring doorbells 

836
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,470
说一番机械套话
and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.

837
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,710
你是介意降薪50，是吗？ 
What's troubling you is that $50 cut, isn't it?

838
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,310
-谁都会介意     -听着，沃特
Well, that'd trouble anybody. Now look, Walter.

839
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,360
我说的工作需要头脑与正义感
The job I'm talking about takes brains and integrity.

840
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,330
和比50个销售员加起来还多的胆量
It takes more guts than there is in 50 salesmen.

841
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:39,520
这是保险业中的热门
It's the hottest job in the business.

842
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,820
对，但还是个办公室工作
Yeah, but it's still a desk job.

843
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,020
-我不想被困在办公室     -办公室工作？
I don't want to be nailed to a desk. Desk job?

844
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,690
你就看到这些？  
Is that all you can see in it?

845
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,740
只有朝九晚五放你屁股的破椅子？
Just a hard chair to park your pants on from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?

846
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,160
只有大堆文件...
Just a pile of papers to shuffle around, 

847
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,530
几根铅笔...
and five sharp pencils...

848
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,180
算数的黑板...
and a scratch pad to make figures on, 

849
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,980
胡乱的涂鸦
maybe a little doodling on the side.

850
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,070
但，我不是这么看的，沃特
Well, that's not the way I look at it, Walter.

851
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,040
我说，索赔员是外科医生  
To me, a claims man is a surgeon, 

852
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,240
办公桌是手术台
that desk is an operating table...

853
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,150
铅笔是手术刀和骨锯
and those pencils are scalpels and bone chisels.

854
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,800
那些纸不只是
And those papers are not just 

855
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,020
赔偿声明、表格和数据
forms and statistics and claims for compensation.

856
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:11,220
他们是活生生的，充满戏剧性
They're alive. They're packed with drama...

857
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:13,620
充满纠结的希望和扭曲的梦想
with twisted hopes and crooked dreams.

858
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,930
索赔员，沃特，是医生、侦探和...
A claims man, Walter, is a doctor and a bloodhound and a...

859
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,530
谁？好，等一下
Who? Okay, hold on a minute.

860
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,360
索赔员是医生  
A claims man is a doctor 

861
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,930
侦探、警察、法官、陪审团
and a bloodhound and a cop and a judge and a jury...

862
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,700
和告解神父，集于一身
and a father confessor, all in one.

863
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,330
而你想告诉我你没兴趣？ 
And you want to tell me you're not interested?

864
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,570
你不想用脑袋工作？ 
You don't want to work with your brains?

865
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,700
你只想用手按门铃来工作？
All you want to work is with your finger on the doorbell...

866
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,310
就为一周多几块钱？   有个女人找你
for a few bucks more a week. There's a dame on your phone.

867
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,910
-我是沃特.奈夫     -我必须打给你，沃特
Walter Neff speaking. I had to call you, Walter.

868
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,350
事关紧急，有人在旁边吗？  
It's very urgent. Are you with somebody?

869
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,980
是，我是。我再打给你好吗，麦姬 ？ 
Yes, I am. Can't I call you back, Margie?

870
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,890
不行，我没时间，很紧急
No, you can't. I've only got a minute. It can't wait.

871
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,260
听着，他今晚出发，坐火车，你在听吗？  
Listen. He's going tonight. On the train. Are you listening?

872
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,930
-沃特？     -我在听，麦姬
Walter? Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.

873
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,160
-有话快说好吗？    -他拄拐杖
Only, make it snappy, will you? He's on crutches.

874
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,070
医生说
The doctor says 

875
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,570
如果小心点他能去，活动对他有好处
he can go if he's careful. The change will do him good.

876
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,410
太好了，沃特，如你所愿，坐火车
It's wonderful, Walter. Just the way you wanted it, on a train.

877
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,040
而且拄拐杖会更有利，是吗？  
Only with the crutches it makes it much better, doesn't it?

878
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,550
对，好多了
Yeah. Yeah, that's 100% better.

879
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,450
稍等一下好吗？
Hold the line a minute, will you?

880
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,210
基斯，等会我去找你？  
Keyes, suppose I join you in your office? 

881
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,250
没关系，我等你
That's all right. I'll wait.

882
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,760
只是告诉她别说上一天
Only tell her not to take all day.

883
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,650
继续
Go ahead.

884
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,060
是格伦戴尔10点15分的火车，我开车送他
It's the 10:15 from Glendale. I'm driving him.

885
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,960
还是那条黑暗的街道，是吗？ 
It's still the same dark street, isn't it?

886
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:28,300
-信号是三声喇叭     -好，还有事吗？  
And the signal is three honks on the horn. Okay. Anything else?

887
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,100
没有
No.

888
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,360
哦...
Oh, uh...

889
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,530
你选了什么颜色？ 
what color did you pick?

890
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:36,510
蓝色，海军蓝。 他左腿打石膏
Blue. Navy blue. And the cast is on his left leg.

891
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,440
恩
Mmm-hmm.

892
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,510
好，很适合我
Yeah, that suits me fine.

893
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,850
事到临头了，沃特，我浑身发抖
This is it, Walter. I'm shaking like a leaf.

894
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,940
但我们会彻头彻尾
But it's straight down the line for both of us.

895
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,150
-我爱你，沃特。   -再见
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

896
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,130
-对不起，基斯      -怎么了？
Sorry, Keyes. What's the matter?

897
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:54,920
有女孩追你吗？有新欢？还是说与我无关？
Dames chasing you again? Or still? Or is it none of my business?

898
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,860
如果我告诉你是个客人...
If I told you it was a customer...

899
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:59,090
麦姬，我猜她喝酒对瓶吹
Margie. I bet she drinks from the bottle.

900
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:01,030
你为什么不安定下来结婚，沃特？ 
Why don't you settle down and get married, Walter?

901
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:05,160
-你为什么不呢？      -我曾经差点，很久以前
Why don't you, for instance? I almost did, once. Long time ago.

902
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,000
基斯，我得打电话给客人
Now look, Keyes, I've got to call on a prospect.

903
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,600
我俩连教堂都选好了
Even had the church picked out, the dame and I.

904
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,910
她有一件带荷叶边的丝裙
She had a white satin dress with flounces on it.

905
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,810
我正在去珠宝店买戒指的路上
I was on my way to the jewelry store to buy the ring.

906
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,480
然后这里突然有个小人开始活动
And then suddenly that little man in here started working on me.

907
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,080
所以你回去把她调查一番？
So you went back and had her investigated?

908
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,590
对，事情终于水落石出
Yeah. And the stuff that came out...

909
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,920
她自从16岁就开始染发
She'd been dyeing her hair ever since she was 16.

910
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,520
她家有个躁郁症患者，她母亲那边
There was a manic depressive in her family, on her mother's side.

911
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,220
她已经有个丈夫
She already had one husband.

912
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,390
他是巴尔的摩的职业台球手...
He was a professional pool player in Baltimore.

913
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:33,530
-至于她哥...       -我大致明白了
And as for her brother... I get the general idea.

914
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,710
她是众多骗子中的一个  
She was a tramp from a long line of tramps. 

915
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,230
对，好了，好了
Yeah. All right, all right.

916
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:40,040
-那我怎么对诺顿说？关于我说的那份工作？  
Now what do I say to Norton? What about this job I want you for?

917
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:41,670
我想我不想要，基斯
I don't think I want it, Keyes.

918
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,230
-但非常感谢      -好吧
Thanks just the same. Fair enough.

919
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,410
你得明白，我选择你，
Only get this, I picked you for the job...

920
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,640
不是认为你很聪明
not because I think you're so darn smart...

921
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,100
而是因为我以为你没有...
but because I thought you were a shade less dumb 

922
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,050
表面看起来那么笨
than the rest of the outfit.

923
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:03,220
大概我错了。 你并不聪明，沃特
Guess I was wrong. You're not smarter, Walter.

924
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,590
只是比较高
You're just a little taller.

925
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,880
是的，基斯
Yes, Keyes.

926
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:21,540
我说到的宿命只是拖延了我
Those Fates I was talking about had only been stalling me off.

927
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,980
现在它已启动开关，运转齿轮
Now they had thrown the switch. The gears had meshed.

928
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:27,720
用来思考的时间已用尽
The time for thinking had all run out.

929
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,890
我希望从始至终
I wanted my movements accounted 

930
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,190
我的行动都无懈可击
for up to the last possible moment.

931
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,030
所以我离开办公室时  
So when I left the office 

932
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:36,390
把计算本放到办公桌上，假装遗落
I put my rate book on the desk as if I had forgotten it.

933
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,490
那是我的伏笔之一
That was part of my alibi.

934
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,670
从此开始，只需按照时间表...
From here on, it was a question of following the timetable...

935
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,760
按部就班
move by move.

936
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:48,700
我大约7点到家，停车入库
I got home about 7:00 and drove right into the garage.

937
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,710
这又是制造不在场证明的伏笔
This was another item to establish my alibi.

938
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,380
-嗨，奈夫先生     -你好，查理
Hi, Mr. Neff. Hello, Charlie.

939
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:57,280
帮我洗车好吗？
How about giving the heap a wash job?

940
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,510
你何时要？  
How soon you gonna want it?

941
00:47:58,590 --> 00:47:59,990
前面有几辆了
I got a couple cars ahead of you.

942
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,580
随你方便，查理
Any time you get to it, Charlie.

943
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,890
-晚上我待在家     -好
I'm staying in tonight. Okay.

944
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,960
回公寓后我打给路.舒华兹...
Up in my apartment I called Lou Schwartz...

945
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,330
我办公室的另一销售员
one of the salesmen that shared my office.

946
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,760
他住在威斯伍德  
He lived in Westwood, 

947
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,800
所以那算长途电话，会有记录
so it was a toll call and there'd be a record of it.

948
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:14,170
我告诉他我忘带计算本，我需要...
I told him I'd forgotten my rate book and needed some dope...

949
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,170
一些我在弄的公债事务的资料...
on the public liability bond I was figuring.

950
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,430
我换上...
I changed into 

951
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,070
迪崔克森将会穿的海军蓝衣服
a navy blue suit like Dietrichson was going to wear.

952
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,240
路.舒华兹回电，给了我很多数据
Lou Schwartz called me back and gave me a lot of figures.

953
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,750
我将毛巾，胶带装进衣兜
I stuffed a hand towel and a roll of adhesive into my pockets...

954
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,810
可以用来做成...
so I could fake something 

955
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,810
像断腿上石膏的东西
that looked like a cast on a broken leg.

956
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:32,910
接着，我在电话里插了张卡片
Next, I stuck a card inside the telephone box...

957
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,820
如果铃响，卡片就会掉
so that it would fall down if the bell rang.

958
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,380
那样我就知道我不在时是否有来电
That way I'd know if anybody had called me while I was away.

959
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,210
门铃也如法炮制
Then I did the same thing to the doorbell 

960
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,660
以防有人上门找我
in case anybody came to see me.

961
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:47,800
我走保洁楼梯离开住所，没人看见我
I left the apartment by the service stairs. Nobody saw me.

962
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,070
我步行从公寓走到迪崔克森家
I walked all the way from my apartment to the Dietrichson house.

963
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,510
我不想搭巴士
I didn't want to take the bus...

964
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,670
因为有可能...
because there was always the chance 

965
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,240
有人会记得在巴士上见过我
that someone might remember seeing me on it.

966
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,300
我谨慎到这种程度
I was being that careful.

967
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,310
我又问到金银花的味道
I could smell that honeysuckle again.

968
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,580
只是这次更加强烈，而这次是晚上
Only it was even stronger, now that it was night.

969
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:13,190
我尽可能安静的打开车库门
I slid the garage door open as quietly as I could.

970
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:16,590
她已按我说的，将车头朝外停好
She'd backed the sedan in, just the way I told her to.

971
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,160
我认为这样停更安全
I'd figured it was safer that way...

972
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:21,290
以防他在她将车开出前就上车
in case he got into the car before she drove it out.

973
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,670
我进到车后部
I got into the back of the car.

974
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,210
躺在地上等待
I lay there on the floor and waited.

975
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,590
我一直在想着...
All the time I was thinking about 

976
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,370
通往火车站的黑暗街道
that dark street on the way to the station...

977
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,240
我的动手之处...
where I was to do it...

978
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:34,080
以及作为信号的三声喇叭
and the three honks on the horn that were to be the signal.

979
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,550
十分钟后，他们下来了
About 10 minutes later they came down.

980
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,350
-还好吗，亲爱的？    -是的，还好
All right, honey? Yeah, I'm all right.

981
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,850
我马上把车开出来
I'll have the car out in a second.

982
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,960
-慢慢来，还有很多时间     -对
Take it easy, honey. We've got lots of time. Yeah.

983
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,410
牢记医生的话。如果你不小心...
Remember what the doctor said. If you get careless...

984
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,210
以后会成为长短腿
you might end up with a shorter leg.

985
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:48,090
那又怎样？我可以打断另一条让它们一样长
So what? I could break the other one and match them up again.

986
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,950
摆脱我让你感觉不错，是吗？  
It makes you feel pretty good to get away from me, doesn't it?

987
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:54,720
只是四天，最迟周一我就回来
It's only for four days. I'll be back Monday at the latest.

988
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:14,110
不是这条街，干嘛在这转弯？  
This is not the right street. Why did you turn here?

989
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,180
你这是干吗？ 
What are you doing that for?

990
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,660
按喇叭干吗？  
What are you honking the horn for?

991
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,810
你应付搬运工和售票员
You take care of the redcap and the conductor.

992
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,220
-不用担心      -尽量离我远点
Don't worry. Keep away from me as much as you can.

993
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:29,570
告诉他们我不想被帮助  
Tell them I don't want to be helped. 

994
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:30,760
我说过，不用担心，沃特
I said, don't worry, Walter.

995
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,060
火车一走你就出发，
You start as soon as the train leaves.

996
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,370
到达冶炼厂后，  
When you get to the refinery, 

997
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:35,790
离开公路开上土路
turn off the highway onto the dirt road.

998
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,420
从那开始整五分之四英里...
From there it's exactly eight-tenths of a mile...

999
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,930
就到铁轨旁的垃圾场。记住  
to the dump beside the tracks. Remember.

1000
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,530
-我全都记得。    -不要超速
I remember everything. No speeding.

1001
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:45,570
你不想被警察截停，而他在后面
You don't want any cops stopping you with him in the back.

1002
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,010
沃特，我们排练过很多次了。
Walter, we've been through all that so many times.

1003
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,340
离开公路时，关闭所有灯光
When you leave the highway, turn off all your lights.

1004
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,540
我会到后面的观景台
I'll be back on the observation platform.

1005
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:55,280
我会在预定位置附近跳车
I'll drop off as close to the spot as I can.

1006
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:58,410
等火车经过后，闪两次灯
Let the train pass, then dim your lights twice.

1007
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,340
-旧金山，女士？    -9车厢，11室  
San Francisco train, lady? Car 9, section 11. 

1008
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:03,890
只有我丈夫
Just my husband.

1009
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,450
9车厢，11室？这边请
Car 9, section 11? This way please.

1010
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,470
谢谢。我丈夫不希望别人帮忙
Thank you. My husband doesn't like to be helped.

1011
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,400
8车厢。在那里
Car number 8. Up there.

1012
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:27,310
9车厢，11室。 谢谢
Car 9, section 11. Thank you.

1013
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,320
这是车票，一定要小心腿
Here're the tickets. Take good care of yourself with that leg.

1014
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:33,750
好，你开车回家要小心
Yeah. You take it easy driving home.

1015
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:37,260
-我会想你的，宝贝    -11室，先生
I'll miss you, honey. Section 11, sir.

1016
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,030
-全部登车！    -谢谢
All aboard! Thank you.

1017
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,260
-再见，亲爱的      -全部登车！
Goodbye, honey. All aboard!

1018
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:50,700
好运，亲爱的
Good luck, honey.

1019
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,910
服务员，帮我弄好铺位好吗？
Porter, will you make up my berth right away?

1020
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,040
是，先生
Yes, sir.

1021
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,810
我去后面观景台抽一口烟
I'm going back to the observation car for a smoke.

1022
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:05,580
这边，先生
Right this way, sir.

1023
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,890
要椅子吗？ 
Like a chair?

1024
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:44,020
不，谢谢，我想站一下
No, thanks. I'd rather stand.

1025
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:48,830
-你去很远吗？     -帕洛阿尔托
You going far? Palo Alto.

1026
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,760
我叫杰克逊
My name's Jackson.

1027
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:54,030
我要一路去梅德福，俄勒岗州梅德福
I'm going all the way to Medford. Medford, Oregon.

1028
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,430
我曾断过胳膊
I had a broken arm once.

1029
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,240
石膏令人奇痒难忍，是不是？  
That darn cast itches something fierce, doesn't it?

1030
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,640
我的让我快疯了
I thought I'd go crazy with mine.

1031
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:06,770
帕尔阿尔托是个不错的小镇，你是斯坦福的？  
Palo Alto's a nice little town. You a Stanford man?

1032
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:11,780
-我以前是    -我猜你落下东西了
I used to be. I'll bet you left something behind.

1033
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,950
我经常如此
I always do.

1034
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,430
我的雪茄盒  
My cigar case. 

1035
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:17,490
可能落在我车厢里的外衣里
I guess I left it in my overcoat back in the section.

1036
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,890
你想自己卷支烟吗，未请教...
Would you care to roll yourself a cigarette, Mister...

1037
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,950
迪崔克森
Dietrichson.

1038
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,960
不，谢谢，我想抽雪茄
No thanks, I really prefer a cigar.

1039
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:28,860
也许服务员可以...，好吧，我可以给你拿来
Maybe the porter could... Well, I could get your cigars for you.

1040
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,300
-很乐意，迪崔克森先生     -希望不会麻烦到你
Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson. If it's not too much trouble.

1041
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,580
-9车厢，11室    -9车厢，11室
Car 9, section 11. Car 9, section 11. 

1042
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,170
乐意效劳
With pleasure.

1043
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,010
好了， 必须快点
Okay. This has gotta be fast.

1044
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:25,580
这儿，拿着他的帽子，去前边铁轨拾回拐杖
Here, take his hat. Pick up the crutches back on the tracks.

1045
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,720
好了，宝贝。 行了
Okay, baby. That's it.

1046
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:56,810
好的，走吧
All right. Let's go.

1047
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,530
回去路上，我们又排练一次...
On the way back, we went over once more...

1048
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,030
审讯时她该如何表现...
what she was to do at the inquest...

1049
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,830
如果有审讯的话，以及保险的事，肯定会提及
if they had one, and about the insurance, when that came up.

1050
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,330
我曾担心她可能会有些崩溃，
I was afraid she might go to pieces a little, 

1051
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,030
在我们行事完毕后
now that we had done it.

1052
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,250
但她表现完美，毫不紧张  
But she was perfect. No nerves. 

1053
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,700
没一滴泪，甚至眼都没眨 
Not a tear, not even a blink of the eyes.

1054
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,770
她在离我公寓一个街区外放下我
She dropped me a block from my apartment house.

1055
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:30,040
沃特，怎么了？你不打算吻我吗？ 
Walter, what's the matter? Aren't you going to kiss me?

1056
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,580
彻头彻尾，不是吗？  
It's straight down the line, isn't it?

1057
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:45,790
-我爱你，沃特     -我爱你，宝贝
I love you, Walter. I love you, baby.

1058
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:00,700
11点2分了  
It was two minutes past 11:00, 

1059
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,710
我又从保洁楼梯上楼
as I went up the service stairs again.

1060
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,000
这次也没人看见我  
Nobody saw me this time either. 

1061
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,780
我检查了门铃、电话
In the apartment I checked the bells.

1062
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:09,850
卡片没动，没人来电，没人上门
The cards hadn't moved. No calls. No visitors.

1063
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,340
然后我又换了衣服  
Then I changed my clothes again. 

1064
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,320
还剩最后一件事
That left one last thing to do.

1065
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:20,290
我得下去车房。我想让查理再看到我。
I had to go down to the garage. I wanted Charlie to see me again.

1066
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,880
你又要用车吗？我还没洗好
You gonna use your car, after all? I'm not quite through.

1067
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,810
没关系，查理
Well, that's all right, Charlie.

1068
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,970
只是去杂货店买点吃的
Just going up to the drugstore to get something to eat.

1069
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:36,030
工作了一整夜  
Been working upstairs all night. 

1070
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,020
肚子有点抗议啊
My stomach's getting a little sore at me.

1071
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:38,680
是的，先生
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.

1072
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,610
事情终于告一段落
That was all there was to it.

1073
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:45,350
没有错误，没有疏漏
Nothing had slipped, nothing had been overlooked.

1074
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:47,830
没什么能暴露我们
There was nothing to give us away.

1075
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,450
然而，基斯
And yet, Keyes, 

1076
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:51,520
当我走向杂货店时...
as I was walking down the street to the drugstore...

1077
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,040
我突然觉得一切都将坍塌
suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong.

1078
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,300
听来很疯狂，但这是真的，帮帮我
It sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true, so help me.

1079
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,870
我听不见自己的脚步声
I couldn't hear my own footsteps.

1080
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:06,280
因为那是死人的脚步
It was the walk of a dead man.

1081
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:16,750
那是我毕生最漫长的一夜
That was the longest night I ever lived through, Keyes...

1082
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,970
接下来一天更难熬  
and the next day was worse, 

1083
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:20,690
因事情已经上报纸
when the story had broke in the papers...

1084
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,660
公司的人开始讨论这事
and they started talking about it at the office...

1085
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:25,960
那天之后，你开始接手
and the day after that, when you started digging into it.

1086
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,390
我将手放进衣兜
I kept my hands in my pockets 

1087
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:29,970
因为我觉得它们颤抖不已
because I thought they were shaking.

1088
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,270
我带上墨镜，不让人看我眼睛
I put on dark glasses so people couldn't see my eyes.

1089
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,180
然后又摘下来  
And then I took them off again 

1090
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:36,300
以免他们觉得奇怪
so they wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

1091
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,070
我尝试保持冷静，但是...
I tried to hold myself together, but...

1092
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:42,410
又感觉我的紧张将我撕裂
I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces.

1093
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,990
-噢，沃特？     -嗨，基斯
Oh, Walter? Hello, Keyes.

1094
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,420
过来，大老板想见我们
Come along. The big boss wants to see us.

1095
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:52,790
-迪崔克森的案子？    -一定是
The Dietrichson case? Must be.

1096
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,930
-有问题吗？     -他死了
Anything wrong? Well, the guy is dead.

1097
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,030
我们保的险，我们要赔大了  
We had him insured and it's gonna cost us dough. 

1098
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:58,900
这一直是问题
That's always wrong.

1099
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,230
-他们掌握什么情况了？    -验尸报告
What have they got so far? Autopsy report.

1100
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,110
没有心脏病，没中风  
No heart failure, no apoplexy, 

1101
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:04,930
或任何疾病原因 
no predisposing medical cause of any kind.

1102
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:06,870
死于脖子断了
Died of a broken neck.

1103
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,030
-几时审讯？      -早晨审过了
When's the inquest? Had it this morning.

1104
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,170
他的妻女认尸完毕
His wife and daughter made the identification.

1105
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,640
火车职员
The train people 

1106
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,040
及一些乘客说...
and some of the passengers told how he went through...

1107
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,380
他走到了观景台
to the observation car.

1108
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:19,010
45分钟内就结束了    裁决呢？   意外死亡
It was all over in 45 minutes. Verdict? Accidental death.

1109
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,090
警方认为呢？  
What do the police figure?

1110
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,820
认为他被拐杖绊倒，摔下火车
That he got tangled up in his crutches and fell off the train.

1111
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,520
觉得事实如此
They're satisfied.

1112
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:29,220
又不是他们赔钱。来吧，沃特
It's not their dough. Come on, Walter.

1113
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,560
好。   非常感谢，各位
All right. Thank you very much, gentlemen.

1114
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,860
我相信法律立场已经很清晰了
I believe the legal position is now clear.

1115
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,270
请待命，我也许需要你们
Please stand by. I may need you later.

1116
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,210
请进，基斯先生，还有你，奈夫先生
Come in, Mr. Keyes. You, too, Mr. Neff.

1117
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:46,840
你觉得今天暖和的不舒服吗，基斯先生？  
You find this an uncomfortably warm day, Mr. Keyes?

1118
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:49,910
抱歉，诺顿先生，我不知道这是正式会议
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton, but I didn't know this was formal.

1119
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,350
-两位请坐    -谢谢
Sit down, gentlemen. Thank you.

1120
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,440
有新进展吗？  
Any new developments?

1121
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,220
我刚打长途电话给杰克逊 
I just talked to this Jackson long distance, 

1122
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:55,150
在俄勒冈，梅德福
up in Medford, Oregon.

1123
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,250
那是谁？ 
Who's Jackson?

1124
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,850
他是最后看见迪崔克森活着的人
He's the last man who saw Dietrichson alive.

1125
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:00,490
他们一起在观景台，聊天
They were out on the observation platform together, talking.

1126
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,620
迪崔克森想抽雪茄，于是杰克逊回去...
Dietrichson wanted a cigar and so Jackson went back...

1127
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,360
帮迪崔克森拿雪茄盒
to get Dietrichson's cigar case for him.

1128
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,800
他返回观景台时，迪崔克森没了
When he returned to the observation platform, no Dietrichson.

1129
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:08,730
杰克逊当时没觉得有什么不对
Well, Jackson didn't think anything was wrong until...

1130
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,770
直到电报在圣巴巴拉送至火车
a wire caught up with the train at Santa Barbara.

1131
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,570
他们在伯班克附近的铁轨旁发现迪崔克森的尸体
They found Dietrichson's body on the tracks near Burbank.

1132
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,130
雪茄盒的事很有趣
Very interesting about the cigar case.

1133
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,200
-还有别的吗？     -没什么了
Anything else? No, not much.

1134
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,670
迪崔克森的秘书说
Dietrichson's secretary says 

1135
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:21,270
她不知道保险的事
she didn't know anything about the policy.

1136
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:23,030
还有女儿
There's a daughter, 

1137
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,720
但她只记得奈夫和她父亲...
but all she remembers is Neff talking to her father...

1138
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:27,020
有一晚在他们家中谈过意外险
about accident insurance at their house one night.

1139
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:28,450
我起初说服不了他
I couldn't sell him at first.

1140
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,460
迪崔克森拒绝了，他说他再考虑
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it. He said he'd think it over.

1141
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:34,720
后来我在油田见他时把他搞定了
Later I saw him in the oil fields and closed him.

1142
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,820
他签了申请表，给了我支票
He signed the application and gave me his check.

1143
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,300
这单买卖干的不错啊，奈夫先生
A fine piece of salesmanship that was, Mr. Neff.

1144
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:40,990
得了，没必要责怪奈夫
Well, there's no sense in pushing Neff around.

1145
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:43,040
他在全公司销售业绩最好
He's got the best sales record in the office.

1146
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,730
难道销售员还得预料到顾客...
Are your salesmen supposed to know a customer 

1147
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,370
会摔下火车吗？
is going to fall off the train?

1148
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,240
摔下火车？你肯定迪崔克森是摔下火车吗 ？ 
Fall off a train? Are we sure Dietrichson fell off the train?

1149
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:52,910
-我没听懂    -没听懂，基斯先生？  
I don't get it. You don't, Mr. Keyes?

1150
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,470
那你对案子怎么看？  
Then what do you think of this case?

1151
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:56,310
这份保单将会让我们赔一大笔
This policy might cost us a great deal of money.

1152
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,510
你知道，它包含双倍赔偿条文
As you know, it contains a double indemnity clause.

1153
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:00,350
你有什么观点？  
Just what is your opinion?

1154
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,150
-没有任何观点。    -没有任何预感？  
No opinion at all. Not even a hunch?

1155
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,590
你那些有趣的预感之一？  
One of those interesting little hunches of yours?

1156
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,990
没有，无任何预感
Nope. Not even a hunch.

1157
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:09,760
我很意外，基斯先生。我形成了一个很确定的观点。
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've formed a very definite opinion.

1158
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:12,020
我觉得我知道。事实上，
I think I know. In fact, 

1159
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,490
我确定我知道迪崔克森发生了什么事
I know I know what happened to Dietrichson.

1160
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:16,940
-你确定你知道什么？     -我知道这不是意外
You know you know what? I know it was not an accident.

1161
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,870
-你有什么看法？      -我？  
What do you say to that? Me?

1162
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,650
对，球到你手了，看看你的表现
Well, you've got the ball. Let's see you run with it.

1163
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:29,090
有种普遍的看法...
There's a widespread feeling 

1164
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:30,280
就因为一个人有间大办公室...
that just because a man has a large office...

1165
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:36,050
是吗？请叫她进来
Yes? Have her come in, please.

1166
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:38,150
有种普遍的看法...
There's a widespread feeling that...

1167
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:41,530
就因为一个人有间大办公室，他就肯定是白痴
just because a man has a large office, he must be an idiot.

1168
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,530
我有访客，希望你们别介意
I'm having a visitor, if you don't mind.

1169
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,570
不，不，我想你们留下看我处理
No, no. I want you to stay and watch me handle this.

1170
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:48,260
迪崔克森太太
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1171
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,870
非常感谢你能来，迪崔克森太太
Thank you very much for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1172
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:57,710
请相信我很感激。这位是基斯先生
I assure you I appreciate it. This is Mr. Keyes.

1173
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,250
-你好      -你好
How do you do? How do you do?

1174
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:01,340
-还有奈夫先生    -我见过奈夫先生，你好
And Mr. Neff. I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do?

1175
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,980
迪崔克森太太，请坐好吗？
Mrs. Dietrichson. Won't you sit down?

1176
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,450
对您的丧亲之痛我们深感同情
May I extend our sympathy in your bereavement?

1177
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,400
我曾犹豫过
I hesitated before 

1178
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:11,010
这么快就叫您来是否合适
asking you to come here so soon after your loss.

1179
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:13,180
但既然您来了  
But now that you're here 

1180
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,760
希望您别介意我直入主题？
I hope you won't mind if I plunge straight into business?

1181
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:16,390
你知道我们为何叫你来，是吗？ 
You know why we asked you to come, don't you?

1182
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,060
不，我只知道你的秘书语气很紧急
No. All I know is that your secretary made it sound very urgent.

1183
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:21,260
你丈夫向本公司购买了意外险
Your husband had an accident policy with this company.

1184
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,030
很明显你不知道，迪崔克森太太
Evidently you don't know that, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1185
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,970
是的，我记得在家讨论过 
No. I remember some talk at the house, 

1186
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:25,830
但他好像不想买
but he didn't seem to want it.

1187
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:28,500
你丈夫几天后购买了，  
Your husband took the policy out a few days later, 

1188
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,210
迪崔克森太太
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1189
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,770
你可能会在他的私人物品中找到保单
You'll probably find the policy among his personal effects.

1190
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:33,610
他的保险箱还没打开
His safe-deposit box hasn't been opened yet.

1191
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,670
那好像需要税务审查员在场
It seems a tax examiner has to be present.

1192
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,450
对不起，迪崔克森太太，我不想让你觉得...
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson, I don't want you to think...

1193
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,950
你在遭受盘问...
you're being subjected to any questioning...

1194
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:40,650
但我们想知道几件事
but there are a few things we should like to know.

1195
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,750
哪方面的？ 
What sort of things?

1196
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,320
我们收到验尸官的报告
We have the report of the coroner's inquest.

1197
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:47,450
意外死亡。我们并不完全满意
Accidental death. We are not entirely satisfied.

1198
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:50,120
事实上，我们一点都不满意
In fact, we are not satisfied at all.

1199
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:54,690
坦白说，迪崔克森太太，我们怀疑...
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect...

1200
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:57,270
他是自杀
a suicide.

1201
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:04,040
-对不起。要杯水吗？    -好
I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of water? Please.

1202
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,150
谢谢
Thank you.

1203
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,730
你丈夫最近有否情绪低落，喜怒无常，
Had your husband been depressed or moody lately, 

1204
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,680
迪崔克森太太？
Mrs. Dietrichson?

1205
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,520
比如说，他有没有财务问题？
Did he have financial worries, for instance?

1206
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,260
他状态很好  
He was perfectly all right 

1207
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:25,930
我也不知道有什么财政问题
and I don't know of any financial worries.

1208
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,130
让我们研究一下这所谓的意外
Let us examine this so-called accident.

1209
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,500
首先，你丈夫在保密情况下...  
First, your husband takes out 

1210
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,330
购了保险，为什么？
this policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

1211
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,520
因为他不希望家人...
Because he doesn't want his family 

1212
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,410
怀疑他的用意
to suspect what he intends to do.

1213
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,140
-什么用意？     -接着，他独身一人出门
Do what? Next, he goes on this trip entirely alone.

1214
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:39,890
他必须独身一人  
He has to be alone. 

1215
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:41,810
他蹒跚一路，走到观景台
He hobbles all the way out to the observation platform.

1216
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,710
腿打了石膏很不方便  
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast, 

1217
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,550
他必有很重要的理由
unless he has a very strong reason.

1218
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:48,880
到达后，发现不只他一人，有个人在那
Once there, he finds he is not alone. There is a man there.

1219
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,900
他叫什么名字，基斯？
What was his name, Keyes? 

1220
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,690
他叫杰克逊    可能还叫这名
His name was Jackson. Probably still is.

1221
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,180
于是他打发了杰克逊
So he gets rid of this Jackson 

1222
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,890
用些关于雪茄的简单借口
with some flimsy excuse about cigars.

1223
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,260
然后他就独自一人了，然后他就做了。    -做什么？  
And then he is alone. And then he does it. Does what?

1224
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:04,030
跳了，自杀。这种情况下，公司不负责。
He jumps. Suicide. In which case, the company is not liable.

1225
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:07,270
当然你知道。现在，我们可以上法庭...
You know that, of course. Now, we could go to court...

1226
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:11,140
我一无所知，事实上，我都不知道为何来这里
I don't know anything. In fact, I don't know why I came here.

1227
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:12,290
请稍等一下  
Just a moment, please. 

1228
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:14,640
我说可以上法庭，没说我们想上
I said we could go to court. I didn't say we want to.

1229
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,620
我的建议是双方都妥协一下，
What I want to suggest is a compromise on both sides.

1230
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:20,150
一定金额的协议，一部分的保单价值
A settlement for a certain sum, a part of the policy value.

1231
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,820
别麻烦了，诺顿先生  
Don't bother, Mr. Norton. 

1232
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,920
我进来时，不知道你们欠我钱
When I came in here, I had no idea you owed me any money.

1233
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:26,020
你说你们欠我钱，又说你们没有
You told me you did. Then you told me you didn't.

1234
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:28,530
现在又告诉我你们想付一部分，还是什么的
Now you tell me you want to pay me a part of it, whatever it is.

1235
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,930
你居然在这时候跟我讨价还价
You want to bargain with me, at a time like this.

1236
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,350
我不喜欢你对我丈夫的猜测  
I don't like your insinuations about my husband, 

1237
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,370
也不喜欢你的手法
and I don't like your methods.

1238
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:38,170
事实上，我不喜欢你，诺顿先生。再见，各位
In fact, I don't like you, Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.

1239
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:46,240
干的漂亮，诺顿先生。你带球不错，
Nice going, Mr. Norton. You sure carried that ball.

1240
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:47,680
不过射门时摔倒
Only you fumbled on the goal line.

1241
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:48,980
又因为非法向前传球犯规
Then you heaved an illegal forward pass 

1242
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,950
被处分后退40码
and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.

1243
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,580
现在你爬不起来了 
Now you can't pick yourself up 

1244
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:53,950
因为你站不住脚
because you haven't got a leg to stand on.

1245
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:55,930
是吗？她可以上法庭  
I haven't, eh? She can go to court 

1246
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:57,050
我们来证明是自杀
and we can prove it was suicide.

1247
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,610
哦，可以吗？  
Oh, can we?

1248
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,060
诺顿先生  
Mr. Norton, 

1249
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:02,530
我的第一反应也是自杀
the first thing that struck me was that suicide angle.

1250
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,080
但三秒之后，我就将这个想法
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper basket 

1251
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,330
扔进废纸篓
just three seconds later.

1252
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,340
你看，你有时也要看看...
You know, you ought to take a look 

1253
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,960
自杀的统计数据
at the statistics on suicide sometime.

1254
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,510
你也许会学到有关保险业的一点东西
You might learn a little something about the insurance business.

1255
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,700
基斯先生，我在保险业中长大
Mr. Keyes, I was raised in the insurance business.

1256
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,540
是啊，在前台。
Yeah, in the front office.

1257
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,360
你一辈子没看过一张保险精算表，
Come now, you've never read an actuarial table 

1258
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,770
不是吗？
in your life, have you?

1259
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:22,110
怎么呢，他们在自杀方面就有10大卷
Why, they've got 10 volumes on suicide alone.

1260
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,980
自杀按种族、肤色、职业
Suicide by race, by color, by occupation...

1261
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:26,040
性别、年中季节、日中时刻分类
by sex, by seasons of the year, by time of day.

1262
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,140
自杀方法呢？  
Suicide, how committed? 

1263
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:29,490
服毒，枪击，溺水，跳跃
By poisons, by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.

1264
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:32,220
服毒自杀，按毒药品种分类...
Suicide by poison, subdivided by types of poison...

1265
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,920
腐蚀性的，刺激性的，全身性的，气体性的，麻醉性的
such as corrosive, irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic...

1266
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,460
生物碱类，蛋白类等等
alkaloid, protein, and so forth.

1267
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:39,230
跳跃自杀，分为从高处跳...
Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps from high places...

1268
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,430
往火车轮下跳，往卡车轮下跳...
under the wheels of trains, under the wheels of trucks...

1269
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,770
往马蹄下跳，从轮船上跳。但，诺顿先生...
under the feet of horses, from steamboats. But, Mr. Norton...

1270
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:46,610
在所有过往案例中，  
of all the cases on record 

1271
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,530
没有一个自杀案件...
there's not one single case of suicide by leap...

1272
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:49,970
是从移动中的火车尾部跳
from the rear end of a moving train.

1273
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,810
你知道路过尸体发现地时...
And do you know how fast that train was going...

1274
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,850
火车时速多少吗？  每小时15英里
at the point where the body was found? 15 miles an hour.

1275
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,080
怎么会有人从这么慢的火车上跳下...
Now how can anybody jump off a slow moving train like that...

1276
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:00,020
还期望能够杀死自己呢？  
with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself?

1277
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,780
没什么里格楞了，诺顿先生
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.

1278
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,090
我们栽了，这次得大出血了
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay through the nose, 

1279
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:04,950
你明知道
and you know it.

1280
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:06,620
我可以喝吗？  
May I have this?

1281
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,560
走吧，沃特
Come on, Walter.

1282
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,900
下次我会租套燕尾服
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

1283
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,790
当时我真该拥抱你，基斯
I could have hugged you right then and there, Keyes...

1284
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:37,410
你和你的数据
you and your statistics.

1285
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:40,220
你是我们唯一真正害怕的人
You were the only one we were really scared of...

1286
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:43,020
但你却几乎成了我们的队友
and instead you were almost playing on our team.

1287
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:46,260
那晚我到家时，已不再紧张了
That evening when I got home, my nerves had eased off.

1288
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,360
我再次感到脚踏实地
I could feel the ground under my feet again.

1289
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:51,230
看来将来会一帆风顺
And it looked like easy going from there on in.

1290
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:53,570
那10万块对我们来说就像...
That $100,000 looked as safe for Phyllis and me...

1291
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,300
已经拿到了银行支票
as if we had the check already deposited in the bank.

1292
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:07,120
喂？   嗨，宝贝。   当然，一切顺利
Hello? Oh, hello, baby. Sure, everything is fine.

1293
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,510
你在诺顿面前表现很好
You were wonderful in Norton's office.

1294
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:12,820
感觉很怪，我一直想看你
I felt so funny, I wanted to look at you all the time.

1295
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:15,420
你以为我不是吗，宝贝？ 你在哪？ 
How do you think I felt, baby? Where are you?

1296
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,090
在杂货店，一街区以外
At the drugstore. Just a block away.

1297
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:20,430
-我能上来吗？   -好，但要小心
Can I come up? Okay. But be careful.

1298
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,260
不要让人看见
Don't let anybody see you.

1299
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,030
嗨，基斯
Hello, Keyes.

1300
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,330
-你有什么心事？  -那只断腿
What's on your mind? That broken leg.

1301
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:01,970
-那人的腿断了     -你在说什么？  
The guy had a broken leg. What are you talking about?

1302
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,570
迪崔克森的事，他有意外险，对吗？
Talking about Dietrichson. He had accident insurance, didn't he?

1303
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:07,910
-对     -然后他断了腿，对吗？
Yeah. Then he broke his leg, didn't he?

1304
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,920
-那又怎样？    -他却没索赔 
So what? And he didn't put in a claim.

1305
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:13,750
-他为什么不索赔？为什么？    -你想说什么？  
Why didn't he put in a claim? Why? What are you driving at?

1306
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,720
沃特，我俩小时前吃的饭，现在还在噎着
Walter, I had dinner two hours ago and it stuck half way.

1307
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:20,490
你的小人儿又开始活动了，是吗？  
That little man of yours is acting up again, huh?

1308
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,890
迪崔克森的案子有问题
There's something wrong with the Dietrichson case.

1309
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,450
为什么？因为他没索赔？
Why? Because he didn't file a claim? 

1310
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:26,800
也许他只是没时间
Maybe he just didn't have time.

1311
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:29,860
也许他不知道自己有保险
Maybe he just didn't know that he was insured.

1312
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,530
不 ，不，不会是那样
No. No, that couldn't be it.

1313
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,800
你亲自把保单给他的，是吗？  
You delivered the policy to him personally, didn't you?

1314
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,900
-是的    -拿到他的支票了？
Yeah. You got his check?

1315
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,140
当然
Sure I did.

1316
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:41,880
-有没有苏打水？    -没有
Got any bicarbonate of soda? No, I haven't.

1317
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:46,280
沃特，我跟我的小人儿生活26年了
Walter, I've been living with this little man for 26 years.

1318
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:49,450
他从没令我失望。这案件肯定有问题
And he's never failed me yet. There's got to be something wrong.

1319
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,960
也许诺顿说的对。也许是自杀
Well, maybe Norton was right. Maybe it was suicide.

1320
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:53,620
不，不是自杀
No. Not suicide.

1321
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:57,290
-但也不是意外。  -那是什么？  
But not an accident, either. What else?

1322
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,060
听好，沃特
Now look, Walter.

1323
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:02,100
有人购买了一份如果死在火车上...
A guy takes out an accident policy that's worth $100,000...

1324
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:03,230
会获赔10万的保险
if he's killed on a train.

1325
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,200
两周后，他死在了火车上
Then two weeks later, he is killed on a train.

1326
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:07,270
但不是火车事故 
And not in a train accident, mind you, 

1327
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:09,270
而是从什么观景台摔下来
but falling off some silly observation car.

1328
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:12,010
你知道这个几率有多高？  
Do you know what the mathematical probability of that is?

1329
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,980
不知道几十亿分之一
One out of I don't know how many billions.

1330
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:18,540
那人还是断腿的  
And add to that the broken leg. 

1331
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,410
不，不会是表面这个样子
No, it just can't be the way it looks.

1332
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,980
-事情有蹊跷   -例如什么？  
Something has been worked on us. Such as what?

1333
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,190
谋杀？  
Murder?

1334
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,570
你有没有薄荷糖什么的？  
Don't you have any peppermint or something?

1335
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,440
-对不起。要点苏打水？    -不用了
Sorry. Want a little soda water? No, no, no.

1336
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:41,800
你怀疑谁 ？ 
Who do you suspect?

1337
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,810
也许我喜欢为自己省点事
Maybe I like to make things easy for myself.

1338
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,900
但我总是倾向怀疑受益人
But I always tend to suspect the beneficiary.

1339
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,070
-你是指他妻子？   -对  
You mean the wife? Yeah.

1340
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:47,790
那个两眼无辜  
That wide-eyed dame 

1341
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:49,710
对什么都一无所知的妇人
that just didn't know anything about anything.

1342
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:51,810
你疯了，基斯，她都不在火车上
You're crazy, Keyes. She wasn't even on the train.

1343
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,150
我知道，沃特
I know she wasn't, Walter.

1344
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,450
我没说我知道是怎么干的，或谁干的。。。
I don't claim to know how it was worked, or who worked it...

1345
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,960
但我知道事情的确发生了
but all I know is that it was worked.

1346
01:11:58,030 --> 01:11:59,750
我要去药店了
I've got to get to a drugstore.

1347
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:02,800
这事感觉就像心里有块大石头
This thing feels like a hunk of concrete inside me.

1348
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,560
-晚安，沃特。  -晚安，基斯
Good night, Walter. Good night, Keyes.

1349
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,830
-明早公司见   -好
See you at the office in the morning. Yeah.

1350
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:12,460
我本想今晚立刻就对付她
I'd like to move in on her right now, tonight.

1351
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:15,310
要不是诺顿和他公司政策的那些...
If it wasn't for Norton and his striped-pants ideas 

1352
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:16,700
条条框框
about company policy...

1353
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,440
我会派警察监视，令她晕头转向
I'd have the police after her so fast it'd make her head spin.

1354
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:21,070
他们会将她放进榨汁机
They'd put her through the wringer...

1355
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:23,980
把事情都给榨出来
and, brother, the things they would squeeze out.

1356
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:26,080
只是你没任何证据去进行，基斯
Only you haven't got a single thing to go on, Keyes.

1357
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:28,450
不多，只有26年的经验
Not too much. Just 26 years experience...

1358
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,490
所有的百分比
all the percentage there is, 

1359
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:32,750
以及心里这块大石头
and this hunk of concrete in my stomach.

1360
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:37,190
能给我一个吗？ 
Can I have one of those things?

1361
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,530
-晚安，基斯     -再见，沃特
Good night, Keyes. So long, Walter.

1362
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,150
-他知道多少？    -他什么也不知道
How much does he know? He doesn't know anything.

1363
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,960
只有他该死的预感
It's those stinking hunches of his.

1364
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:11,360
但他证明不了什么，是吗？
And he can't prove anything, can he?

1365
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:15,430
只要我们小心，只要我们暂时别见面
Not if we're careful. Not if we don't see each other for a while.

1366
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,000
-要多久？      -直到风头过去
How long a while? Until this dies down.

1367
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:21,060
你不了解基斯
You don't know Keyes.

1368
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:23,200
他一咬住就不会放开
Once he gets his teeth into something, he never lets go.

1369
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,970
他会调查你，派人跟踪你
He'll investigate you, have you shadowed.

1370
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:27,840
他会从现在起时刻盯着你
He'll watch you every minute from now on.

1371
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,410
-你害怕吗，宝贝？  -我很害怕
You afraid, baby? Yes, I'm afraid.

1372
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,050
不是怕基斯，而是害怕我们  
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of us. 

1373
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:35,480
我们已经变了
We're not the same anymore.

1374
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,510
我们干这事是为了在一起  
We did it so we could be together, 

1375
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:38,720
但这却将我们分开
but instead of that it's pulling us apart.

1376
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,560
-不是吗，沃特？     -你在说什么？  
Isn't it, Walter? What are you talking about?

1377
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:44,320
而且你并不真在乎我们是否见面
And you don't really care whether we see each other or not.

1378
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,290
别这样说，宝贝
Shut up, baby.

1379
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,940
太平洋保险。午安
Pacific All Risk. Good afternoon.

1380
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,840
你好，奈夫先生
Hello, Mr. Neff.

1381
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:00,870
-你好     -我是萝拉.迪崔克森
Hello. Lola Dietrichson.

1382
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:04,180
-你不记得我吗？   -当然记得
Don't you remember me? Yes. Yes, of course.

1383
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,510
我能跟你谈一会儿吗？  
Could I talk with you just a few minutes?

1384
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:09,020
有没有地方可以单独谈？
Somewhere where we could be alone?

1385
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:11,450
有，来我的办公室
Oh, yes. Come into my office.

1386
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,960
是关于最近的事吗？ 
Is it something about what happened?

1387
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:23,630
是，奈夫先生，有关我父亲的死
Yes, Mr. Neff. It's about my father's death.

1388
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,300
我很抱歉，迪崔克森小姐
I'm terribly sorry, Miss Dietrichson.

1389
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,640
路，我可以单独用一会儿办公室吗？ 
Lou, do you mind if I use the office alone for a few minutes?

1390
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,610
没问题，沃特
No. It's all yours, Walter.

1391
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,150
看着我，奈夫先生
Look at me, Mr. Neff.

1392
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:46,680
我没疯，没歇斯底里，甚至没哭
I'm not crazy. I'm not hysterical. I'm not even crying.

1393
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,220
但我有种事有蹊跷的糟糕感觉
But I have the awful feeling that something is wrong...

1394
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:55,330
我曾有过这种感觉，在我母亲死时
and I had that same feeling once before, when my mother died.

1395
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,430
你母亲死时？
When your mother died?

1396
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,900
那时我们在箭头湖，六年前了
We were at Lake Arrowhead. That was six years ago.

1397
01:14:58,970 --> 01:14:59,960
我们有栋小屋
We had a cabin there.

1398
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,030
那是一个冬天，天很冷 
It was winter and very cold. 

1399
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:04,370
我母亲因为肺炎病重
My mother was very sick with pneumonia.

1400
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,410
她有一名护士
She had a nurse with her.

1401
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:09,510
小屋里就我们三个
There were just the three of us in the cabin.

1402
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:12,310
有一晚我起床，去到母亲的房间
One night I got up and went into my mother's room.

1403
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:14,250
她因高烧在胡言乱语
She was delirious with fever.

1404
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,780
所有的被褥都在地上  
All the bed covers were on the floor 

1405
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,020
所有窗户大开
and the windows were wide open.

1406
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:19,290
护士不在房间
The nurse wasn't in the room.

1407
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,550
我赶紧尽快替母亲盖上被子
I ran and covered my mother up as quickly as I could.

1408
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:24,360
此时我听见身后的开门声
Just then I heard a door open behind me.

1409
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,860
护士站在那里
The nurse stood there.

1410
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:31,030
她默不作声，但她的眼神
She didn't say a word, but there was a look in her eyes...

1411
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:32,870
令我无法忘记
I'll never forget.

1412
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:38,040
两天后，我母亲死了
Two days later, my mother was dead.

1413
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:43,680
你知道那护士是谁？  
Do you know who that nurse was?

1414
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,550
-不，谁？    -菲莉丝
No. Who? Phyllis.

1415
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:48,390
我试图告诉爸爸，但那时我只是个孩子
I tried to tell my father, but I was just a kid then.

1416
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:51,620
他不听我的，半年后，他们结婚了
He wouldn't listen to me. Six months later she married him...

1417
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:54,210
我一直安慰自己说
and I kind of talked myself out of the idea 

1418
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:56,100
她不会做那种事
she could have done anything like that.

1419
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,940
但现在这感觉回来了  
But now it's all back again, 

1420
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:00,620
现在我爸爸也出事了
now that something's happened to my father, too.

1421
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,620
这么说没道理，迪崔克森小姐  
You're not making sense, Miss Dietrichson. 

1422
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:04,540
你爸爸是摔下火车
Your father fell off a train.

1423
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:06,220
对，他摔下火车两天前
Yes, and two days before he fell off that train, 

1424
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:07,630
菲莉丝在干嘛？
what was Phyllis doing?

1425
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,200
她在她房间面对镜子，头戴黑帽
She was in her room in front of a mirror, with a black hat on...

1426
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,610
往上披一块黑纱
pinning a black veil to it.

1427
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:15,080
好像她等不及要看自己服丧的样子
As if she couldn't wait to see how she would look in mourning.

1428
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:17,210
您饱受打击，迪崔克森小姐
You've had a pretty bad shock, Miss Dietrichson.

1429
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,910
这些事是不是你的想象？ 
Aren't you just imagining these things?

1430
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:20,450
我在镜子里看到她的眼睛
I caught her eyes in the mirror.

1431
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,550
有着我母亲死前有过的那种眼神
They had that look in them they had before my mother died.

1432
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,110
一样的眼神
That same look.

1433
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,590
你不喜欢你继母，是吗？  
You don't like your stepmother, do you?

1434
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:29,490
是不是就因为她是继母？ 
Isn't it just because she is your stepmother?

1435
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,000
我恨她是因为是她干的，她是为了钱
I loathe her because she did it. She did it for the money.

1436
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:34,400
但你不会赔钱给她，是吗，奈夫先生？
Only you're not going to pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?

1437
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:36,620
她这次没法逍遥法外  
She's not going to get away with it this time, 

1438
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,600
因为我会揭发她
because I'm going to speak up.

1439
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:39,160
我要将我知道的告诉大家
I'm going to tell everything I know.

1440
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,160
你得小心，说这些事..  
You'd better be careful, saying things like... 

1441
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,570
我不害怕，你看着吧
I'm not afraid. You'll see.

1442
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:53,220
对不起
I'm sorry.

1443
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:58,890
我不是有意这样的
I didn't mean to act like this.

1444
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,220
你和我说过的这些，还和谁说过？  
All this that you've been telling me, who else have you told?

1445
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:04,490
没人
No one.

1446
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:07,120
-你的继母呢？   -当然没有
How about your stepmother? Of course not.

1447
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,630
我搬出来了
I've moved out.

1448
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:12,860
我不再住家里了
I'm not living at home anymore.

1449
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:15,500
你还没告诉你男朋友吧？那个扎切提？ 
And you haven't told that boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?

1450
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:18,480
我和他分了，我们吵架了
I'm not seeing him anymore. We had a fight.

1451
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,910
你现在住哪？  
Where are you living now?

1452
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:24,970
我在好莱坞有个小公寓
I got myself a little apartment in Hollywood.

1453
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,220
四堵墙，你就那么呆坐着？  
Four walls, and you just sit and look at them?

1454
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:30,580
是，奈夫先生
Yes, Mr. Neff.

1455
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:34,950
于是那晚我带她去吃饭...
So that evening I took her to dinner...

1456
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:36,860
去了没人会看见我们的...
at a Mexican restaurant down on 

1457
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,690
奥尔韦拉街的一家墨西哥餐馆
Olvera Street where nobody would see us.

1458
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:40,760
我想让她高兴
I wanted to cheer her up.

1459
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:44,600
第二天是周日，我们开车去了海滩
The next day was Sunday and we went for a ride down to the beach.

1460
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:47,400
她心情好了一点，甚至会笑
She had loosened up a bit, she was even laughing.

1461
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:48,840
我得确保她
I had to make sure that 

1462
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,040
不会将菲莉丝的那些事告诉别人
she wouldn't tell that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.

1463
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:54,050
那像炸药，无论真伪
It was dynamite, whether it was true or not.

1464
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,080
而我没机会和菲莉丝交谈
And I had no chance to talk to Phyllis.

1465
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:58,340
你像老鹰般盯着她，基斯
You were watching her like a hawk, Keyes.

1466
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,450
我甚至不能打给她  
I couldn't even phone her 

1467
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:02,750
因为我怕你会监听
because I was afraid you had the wires tapped.

1468
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,170
周一早上我桌上有个便条  
Monday morning there was a note on my desk 

1469
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:06,950
是你想见我，基斯
that you wanted to see me, Keyes.

1470
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:10,000
闪念间我以为是萝拉的事
For a minute I wondered if it could be about Lola.

1471
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,530
事实更糟
It was worse.

1472
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:16,060
你门外是我世上最不愿见的人
Outside your door was the last guy in the world I wanted to see.

1473
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:27,200
进来，进来，沃特
Come in. Come in, Walter.

1474
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,620
-嗨，基斯。    -我想问你点事
Hello, Keyes. I want to ask you something.

1475
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,920
既然我们相识多年...
After all the years we've known each other...

1476
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:35,920
介意我来个直截了当的声明吗？ 
do you mind if I make a rather blunt statement?

1477
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:37,580
-关于什么？     -关于我
About what? About me.

1478
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:40,850
-沃特，我是个伟大的人。  -是吗？
Walter, I'm a very great man. Yeah?

1479
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:43,690
迪崔克森的事，是谋杀...
This Dietrichson business, it's murder...

1480
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,760
而谋杀不会天衣无缝
and murders don't come any neater.

1481
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:48,700
一个毕生难逢的周密谋杀
As fancy a piece of homicide as anybody ever ran into...

1482
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:51,030
聪明、狡猾、近乎完美，只是...
smart, tricky, almost perfect, but...

1483
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:54,410
我想我已全部想通
I think Papa has it all figured out.

1484
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,260
想通并用包装纸包裹
Figured out and wrapped up in tissue paper 

1485
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:58,310
附加粉红蝴蝶结
with pink ribbons on it.

1486
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:01,110
-继续说，我在听    -知道吗？
Go ahead. I'm listening. You know what?

1487
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:04,420
迪崔克森就没上过火车
That guy Dietrichson was never on the train.

1488
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:07,610
-他没有？     -没有
He wasn't? No, he wasn't.

1489
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:11,490
你看，沃特，在时速15英里的火车上...
Now look, Walter. You can't be sure of killing a man...

1490
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:14,690
将人推下，不确定就能杀死他
by throwing him off a train that's going 15 miles an hour.

1491
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,230
唯一保险的办法是之前就杀死他
The only way you can be sure is to kill him first...

1492
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,230
再将尸体丢在铁轨旁
and then throw his body on the tracks.

1493
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,490
那就是说，要么在火车上杀他...
Now that would mean either killing him on the train...

1494
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:22,500
要么...真正聪明之处就在这里，
or, and this is where it really gets fancy, 

1495
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,300
你在别处杀了他...
you kill him somewhere else...

1496
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:26,570
然后将他放在铁轨旁
and put him on the tracks.

1497
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,910
两个可能性，我认为是第二个
Two possibilities, and I personally buy the second.

1498
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,670
你比我厉害多了，基斯
You're way ahead of me, Keyes.

1499
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,540
你看，沃特，是这样...
Well, look, Walter, it was like this.

1500
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:38,480
他们杀掉那人，他妻子和某人...
They killed the guy, the wife and a somebody else...

1501
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,560
然后那人拿着拐杖...  
and the somebody else took the crutches 

1502
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,150
假扮迪崔克森先生上车...
and went on the train as Dietrichson...

1503
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:43,990
然后那人跳车...
then the somebody else jumped off...

1504
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:46,620
然后他们将尸体放在火车经过的铁轨旁
then they put the body on the tracks where the train had passed.

1505
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:49,360
一次扮演，懂吗？易如反掌
An impersonation, see? A cinch to work.

1506
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,290
因为当时是夜晚，很少有人
Because it was night, very few people were about...

1507
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:53,890
他们忙着留意拐杖
they have the crutches to stare at...

1508
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:56,440
反而留意不到人本身
they never really looked at the man at all.

1509
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,660
是很周密，基斯，但可能有点太戏剧化了
Fancy all right, Keyes, but maybe it's a little too fancy.

1510
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:02,110
是吗？告诉你，契合度就像手表齿轮
Is it? I tell you, it all fits together like a watch.

1511
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,680
现在来看我们求证方面的王牌
Now let's see what we have in the way of proof.

1512
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:06,080
唯一曾真正好好看过...
The only guy who really got a good look 

1513
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,650
冒牌迪崔克森先生的人...
at this supposed Dietrichson...

1514
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:09,840
就坐在我门外
is sitting right outside my office.

1515
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,350
我费力将他从俄勒冈请来
I took the trouble to bring him down here from Oregon.

1516
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:17,920
-进来，杰克逊先生    -好的，基斯先生
Come here, Mr. Jackson. Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.

1517
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:19,690
你的雪茄不错
These are fine cigars you smoke.

1518
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,490
-一毛多一根    -就是这意思
Two for a quarter. That's what I said.

1519
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,120
好了，你研究过照片吗？ 
Well, did you study those photographs?

1520
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,220
是的，我仔细研究过
Yes, indeed. I studied them thoroughly.

1521
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,130
-很彻底。    -你有结论了吗？  
Very thoroughly. Have you made up your mind?

1522
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,190
基斯先生，我是个梅德福人，俄勒岗州梅德福
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon.

1523
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:31,430
在梅德福我们不着急下结论
Up in Medford we take our time making up our mind.

1524
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:34,530
这里不是梅德福，这里是急得很，快说吧
Well, we're not in Medford now. We're in a hurry. Let's have it.

1525
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:36,840
这是迪崔克森先生最近的照片？  
Are these photographs of the late Mr. Dietrichson?

1526
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:37,900
是
Yes.

1527
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:40,640
-那我的答案是不。  -什么意思，不？
Then my answer is no. What do you mean, no?

1528
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,910
我是说，这不是火车上那人
I mean, this is not the man that was on the train.

1529
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:44,180
你愿意发誓吗？  
Will you swear to that?

1530
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:46,240
基斯先生，我是个梅德福人，俄勒岗州梅德福
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon.

1531
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,690
开口无妄言，既非妄言，我当然愿意发誓
If I say it, I mean it. If I mean it, of course I'll swear it.

1532
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,380
你看，沃特，这就是证据
There you are, Walter. There's your proof.

1533
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,120
这是奈夫先生，我们的销售员
This is Mr. Neff, one of our salesmen.

1534
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:54,180
幸会，奈夫先生，非常荣幸。
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff. Pleased, indeed.

1535
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:55,630
-你好吗？    -很好，谢谢
How are you? Very fine, thank you.

1536
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:58,060
-不能更好了。     -请坐，杰克逊先生
Never was better. Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

1537
01:20:58,130 --> 01:20:59,810
可以形容一下
Just how would you describe 

1538
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:01,500
你在观景台看到的那人吗？
the man you saw on the observation platform?

1539
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:04,300
我肯定他比较年轻
Well, I'm pretty sure he was a younger man...

1540
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,370
比照片中人年轻10至15岁
about 10 or 15 years younger than the man in these photographs.

1541
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,470
迪崔克森先生快50了，是吗，沃特？
Dietrichson was about 50, wasn't he, Walter?

1542
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:11,940
保单上写的51岁
Fifty-one, according to the policy.

1543
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:14,880
我看见的人绝对不像是51岁
The man I saw was nothing like 51 years old.

1544
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,610
当然，观景台很昏暗
Of course, it was pretty dark out on that platform.

1545
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,950
现在回想，他还刻意背对着我
Come to think of it, he tried to keep his back towards me.

1546
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:22,650
-但我仍很肯定。   -谢谢你，杰克逊
But I'm positive just the same. Thank you, Jackson.

1547
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,160
当然，你明白此事必须绝对保密吧？  
Of course, you understand this matter is strictly confidential?

1548
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:26,460
我们在洛杉矶可能还需要你 
We may need you again down here in Los Angeles, 

1549
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:28,320
如果要上法庭
if the case comes to court.

1550
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,160
随时奉陪，我愿意为你效劳，先生们
Any time you need me, I'm entirely at your disposal, gentlemen.

1551
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:34,530
-只要费用由你支付，当然      -哦，当然
Expenses paid, of course. Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.

1552
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,730
找鲁宾，出纳部的
Get me Lubin, in the cashier's office.

1553
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:41,470
喂，鲁宾，我是基斯
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

1554
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:44,370
听着，我现在让一个叫杰克逊的去你那
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson down to you 

1555
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:45,640
带着报销单
with an expense account.

1556
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:46,830
我们把他从俄勒冈梅德福找来，
Well, we brought him down here from Medford, 

1557
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:48,510
是为了...
Oregon in connection with...

1558
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,350
迪崔克森的案子
the Dietrichson claim.

1559
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,550
支付他的酒店账单，好吗？
Well, take care of his hotel bill, will you?

1560
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:54,710
去过俄勒冈吗，奈夫先生？ 
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?

1561
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:55,810
是的，他马上下去
Yeah. He'll be right down.

1562
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:57,410
没有，从没去过
No. Never been up there.

1563
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,220
等等，你玩钓鳟鱼吗？  
Wait a minute. You go trout fishing?

1564
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:03,960
-我也许在克拉马斯瀑布见过你     -不，我不钓鱼
Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way. Nope. I don't fish.

1565
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:07,560
你不钓鱼，奈夫先生。奈夫...是这名字
You don't go fishing, Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.

1566
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,700
-在科瓦利斯有个奈夫家族    -和我没关系
There's a family of Neffs in Corvallis. No relation.

1567
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:13,170
我想想，那个奈夫是汽车经纪
Let me see. This man's an automobile dealer in Corvallis.

1568
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,570
-听说也很受尊敬        -好了，杰克逊先生
A very reputable man, too, I'm told. All right, Mr. Jackson.

1569
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,170
请去出纳部
Suppose you go down to the cashier's office.

1570
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,710
11楼27室
Room 27 on the 11th floor.

1571
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:20,550
他们会处理你的报销单
He'll take care of your expense account 

1572
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:22,080
及今晚火车票
and your ticket for the train tonight.

1573
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:23,140
今晚 ？ 
Tonight?

1574
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:24,860
明早更好一些。
Tomorrow morning would suit me better. 

1575
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,480
镇上有个很好的整骨疗法专家...
There's a very good osteopath in town...

1576
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:29,350
-我走前想去看看     -整骨疗法专家？ 
I'd like to see before I leave. Osteopath?

1577
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:32,950
好吧，只是这个不报销
Well, just don't put her on the expense account.

1578
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:35,380
好了，再见，先生们
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.

1579
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,760
幸会，再见
It's been a pleasure. Goodbye.

1580
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:42,280
太好了，沃特  
There it is, Walter. 

1581
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,000
纸快包不住火了
It's beginning to come apart at the seams already.

1582
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:46,800
没有完美的谋杀，早晚会露馅
Murder's never perfect. Always comes apart sooner or later.

1583
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:49,340
若有两人参与，一般会早露馅
And when two people are involved, it's usually sooner.

1584
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:52,310
现在，我们知道迪崔克森太太参与了，还有一个人
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame is in it, and a somebody else.

1585
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,400
很快就会知道那人是谁
Pretty soon we'll know who that somebody else is.

1586
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,680
他会出现，一定会的
He'll show. He's got to show. 

1587
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,350
他们总要在某时某处见面
Sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet.

1588
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,710
他们将情绪激动
Their emotions are all kicked up.

1589
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:00,420
是爱是恨并不重要  
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter. 

1590
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,220
他们无法保持距离
They can't keep away from each other.

1591
01:23:02,290 --> 01:23:04,760
他们可能以为两人参与就会双倍安全
They may think it's twice as safe because there are two of them.

1592
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:06,220
但不会双倍安全
But it isn't twice as safe.

1593
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:09,460
而是二十倍危险。他们犯下谋杀罪...
It's 10 times twice as dangerous. They've committed a murder...

1594
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:11,660
而这不像一起乘电车...
and it's not like taking a trolley ride together...

1595
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:13,490
可以在不同站下车
where they can get off at different stops.

1596
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:15,830
他们被捆在一起一路前行
They're stuck with each other and they've got to ride...

1597
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,370
直至到达终点
all the way to the end of the line.

1598
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,770
而这是一趟单程，终站是坟墓
And it's a one-way trip, and the last stop is the cemetery.

1599
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,640
她已经申请索赔
She put in her claim.

1600
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,870
我将会扔回给她
I'm gonna throw it right back at her.

1601
01:23:30,450 --> 01:23:32,210
如果她敢，尽管告我们
Let her sue us if she dares.

1602
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:35,080
我静待她和那个人
I'll be ready for her and that somebody else.

1603
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,680
他们会一起自掘坟墓
They'll be digging their own graves.

1604
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:48,790
迪崔克森太太？这里是杰利店
Mrs. Dietrichson? This is Jerry's Market.

1605
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,770
您需要的英国肥皂
We just got in a shipment of that English soap 

1606
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:51,860
刚刚到货了
you were asking about.

1607
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:55,500
您今天来取吗？谢谢，迪崔克森太太
Will you be coming by today? Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1608
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:25,200
-嗨，沃特    -过来
Hello, Walter. Come over here.

1609
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:31,840
-什么事？  -出大事了
What's the matter? Everything's the matter.

1610
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,210
基斯要拒绝你的索赔
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

1611
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,480
他虎视眈眈等着
He's sitting back with his mouth watering, 

1612
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,880
等待你提出控告
waiting for you to sue.

1613
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:39,750
他希望你提出，但你不可以
He wants you to sue, but you're not going to.

1614
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:42,720
-他凭什么阻止我？    -凭很多
What's he got to stop me? He's got plenty.

1615
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:46,960
他弄清了事发过程
He's figured out how it was worked.

1616
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:48,820
知道火车上的是另有其人
He knows it was somebody else on the train...

1617
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,730
还挖到一个可以作证的目击者
and he's dug up a witness he thinks can prove it.

1618
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,160
怎么证明？ 如果他拒绝赔偿，我就提出控告
Prove it how? If he rejects that claim, I have to sue.

1619
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:55,330
是吗 ？然后你就得上法庭...
Yeah? And then you're in court 

1620
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:56,730
很多其他事就会浮出水面
and a lot of other things are going to come up.

1621
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,640
例如，关于你和首任迪崔克森太太
Like, for instance, about you and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

1622
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:02,640
我和首任迪崔克森太太怎么了？  
What about me and the first Mrs. Dietrichson?

1623
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:03,730
她是怎么死的 
The way she died.

1624
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:05,320
还有你在需要黑帽子之前
And about that black hat you were trying on 

1625
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,840
就试戴黑帽子的事
before you needed a black hat.

1626
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:08,680
萝拉在和你说她那些荒唐故事
Lola's been telling you some of her cockeyed stories.

1627
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:11,080
-她是在见你      -是我在见她，坦白说
She's been seeing you. I've been seeing her, if you want to know.

1628
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:12,850
以防她四处宣扬她知道的那些事
So she won't yell her head off about what she knows.

1629
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,510
她只是在做戏，
She's putting on an act for you, 

1630
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:15,650
在你肩膀哭泣，撒谎...
crying all over your shoulder, the lying...

1631
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,270
别把她扯进来
Keep her out of this. 

1632
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:18,050
我在说的是我们不能提出控告
All I'm telling you is we're not going to sue.

1633
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,320
因为你不想要钱了...
Because you don't want the money anymore...

1634
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:20,590
即使你能要，因为她...
even if you could have it, because she's...

1635
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:21,850
让你突然感觉自己卑鄙无耻？
made you feel like a heel all of a sudden?

1636
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:24,100
已经不是钱的事了 
It isn't the money anymore. 

1637
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,190
是我们的命。得退出了，懂吗？
It's our necks. We're pulling out, do you understand?

1638
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:28,200
因为基斯的威胁？别骗我了，沃特。
Because of what Keyes can do? You're not fooling me, Walter.

1639
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:30,530
是因为萝拉，你对她父亲所做的
It's because of Lola, what you did to her father.

1640
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,640
你害怕她...
You're afraid she 

1641
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,470
终有一天会发现，而你承受不了，你能吗？
might find out someday and you can't take it, can you?

1642
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:35,470
我说过，别把她扯进来
I said, leave her out of this.

1643
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:41,710
我在说我
It's me I'm talking about.

1644
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:43,940
-我不想被抛弃    -别那么说
I don't want to be left out of it. Stop saying that.

1645
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:45,420
只是事情未能如我们所愿
It's just that it hasn't worked as we wanted.

1646
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:46,980
我们无法完成，就这些  
We can't go through with it, that's all. 

1647
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,110
我们已经完成了
We have gone through with it.

1648
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:49,280
困难的部分已经过去
The tough part is all behind us.

1649
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:51,860
现在只需坚持别心软
We just have to hold on now and not go soft inside...

1650
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:54,660
像开始时那样齐心协力
stick close together the way we started out.

1651
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:55,990
小心
Watch it.

1652
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:16,370
我爱你，沃特，而我恨他
I loved you, Walter, and I hated him.

1653
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:19,940
但我没想过要去做什么，直到遇到你
But I wasn't going to do anything about it, not until I met you.

1654
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:23,650
是你一手计划。我只是希望他死。
You planned the whole thing. I only wanted him dead.

1655
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,890
而真正动手杀死他的是我
And I'm the one that fixed it so he was dead.

1656
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,660
-你是想说这个吗？  -没人可以退出
Is that what you're telling me? And nobody's pulling out.

1657
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:33,390
我们一起参与的，也要一起抽身
We went into this together, we're coming out at the end together.

1658
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:37,200
我们要彻头彻尾，记得吗？
It's straight down the line for both of us, remember?

1659
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:45,570
是，我记得
Yes, I remembered.

1660
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:50,210
就像我记得的你的话，基斯...
Just like I remembered what you had told me, Keyes...

1661
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,750
关于乘电车的事...
about that trolley car ride...

1662
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:55,220
在终点站之前无法下车...
and how there was no getting off till the end of the line...

1663
01:26:56,860 --> 01:26:58,760
而终点站是坟墓
where the cemetery was.

1664
01:27:00,190 --> 01:27:03,460
然后我想到坟墓的用途
And then I got to thinking what cemeteries are for.

1665
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:06,360
是用来放死人的
They're to put dead people in.

1666
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:09,930
我猜那是我第一次
I guess that was the first time 

1667
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:11,760
我那样想到菲莉丝
I ever thought about Phyllis that way.

1668
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,360
死亡，我是说
Dead, I mean.

1669
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:17,130
以及她死了会怎样
And how it would be if she were dead.

1670
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:21,240
我那周见过萝拉三四次
I saw Lola three or four times that week.

1671
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,750
有一晚我们去了露天剧场后的山上
One night we went up into the hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.

1672
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:28,790
也许听来疯狂，基斯，但只有和她一起...
I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, but it was only with her that...

1673
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:31,290
我才能放松一点
I could relax and let go a little.

1674
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:03,180
你哭什么？  
Why are you crying?

1675
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:07,320
不会告诉我，是吗？
Not gonna tell me, huh?

1676
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:11,400
当然会，沃特，我只会告诉你一人
Of course I will, Walter. I wouldn't tell anybody else but you.

1677
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:15,530
-是尼诺.扎切提     -他怎么了？  
It's about Nino. Zachetti? What about him?

1678
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:18,570
他们合谋杀了我父亲，他和菲莉丝
They killed my father together. He and Phyllis.

1679
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:21,130
他是帮凶，我肯定
He helped her do it. I know he did.

1680
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:23,910
为什么这样说？  
What makes you say that?

1681
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:25,630
我在跟踪他  
I've been following him. 

1682
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:27,610
他每晚都去她那里
He's been to her house, night after night.

1683
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:30,080
菲莉丝和他一直是同伙
It was Phyllis and him all along.

1684
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:33,160
也许他和我交往只是为了掩饰 
Maybe he was just going with me as a blind. 

1685
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:34,410
谋杀当晚
And the night of the murder...

1686
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:36,580
你答应过我不再这么讲话  
You promised me you weren't gonna talk like this anymore.

1687
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:40,180
他本应在大学讲座后来接我
He was supposed to pick me up after a lecture at UCLA.

1688
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:43,160
但他没来，他说他病了
But he never showed up. He said he was sick.

1689
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,060
病了！
Sick!

1690
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:48,820
他来不了
He couldn't show up, 

1691
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:51,540
因为我爸的火车要开了
because the train was leaving with my father on it.

1692
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:00,440
也许我只是疯了，也许都是幻想
Maybe I'm just crazy. Maybe it's all in my mind.

1693
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,510
当然，都是幻想
Sure, it's all in your mind.

1694
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:07,680
我真希望是，沃特， 因为我还爱他
I only wish it were, Walter, 'cause I still love him.

1695
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:17,460
扎切提，菲莉丝与扎切提
Zachetti. Phyllis and Zachetti.

1696
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:22,070
他去她家做什么 ？ 
What was he doing up at her house? 

1697
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:23,230
我想不出
I couldn't figure that one out.

1698
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:27,970
我试着理出头绪，但没用
I tried to make sense out of it and got nowhere.

1699
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:31,470
但第二天才是心乱如麻
But the real braintwister came the next day.

1700
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:33,200
是你搞的，基斯 
You sprang it on me, Keyes, 

1701
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:36,040
下班后，你在...
after office hours, when you caught me...

1702
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,020
大堂遇到我时
down in the lobby of the building.

1703
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,310
沃特，等一下
Walter. Walter, just a minute.

1704
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,980
-嗨，基斯     -站稳了，沃特
Hello, Keyes. Just hang on to your hat, Walter.

1705
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:50,030
-什么事？   -小事一桩
What for? Oh, nothing much.

1706
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:53,160
迪崔克森的案子刚水落石出
That Dietrichson case just busted wide open.

1707
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:56,460
-怎么回事？   -那人露面了，就这回事
How do you mean? The guy showed. That's how.

1708
01:29:57,670 --> 01:29:59,900
-什么人？     -她的帮凶
What guy? The guy who helped her do it.

1709
01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:01,670
那另一个人？  
The somebody else?

1710
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:05,270
-真的吗？    -对，她刚对我们提起诉讼
No kidding? Yeah. She just filed suit against us.

1711
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:06,640
我准备好了
It's okay by me.

1712
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:08,020
等他们上法庭时  
When we get them in that courtroom, 

1713
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:09,770
我会把他俩撕碎
I'll tear them to pieces, both of them.

1714
01:30:09,850 --> 01:30:12,080
-来，来杯马蒂尼，沃特   -不了，基斯 
Come on. I'll buy you a martini, Walter. No thanks, Keyes.

1715
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:13,140
加两片橄榄叶
With two olives.

1716
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:15,520
不，我得剃须擦鞋，有约会
No, I've got to get a shave and a shoeshine. I've got a date.

1717
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:18,680
麦姬，我还是认为她喝酒对瓶吹
Margie. I still bet she drinks from the bottle.

1718
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:21,020
你买雪茄时他们会给你火柴
They give you matches when you buy cigars, you know.

1719
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:22,390
你只需开口要
All you have to do is ask for them.

1720
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:23,580
我不喜欢  
Don't like them, 

1721
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:26,590
总是在我口袋爆炸。再见，沃特
they always explode in my pocket. So long, Walter.

1722
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:32,960
我吓坏了，基斯
I was scared stiff, Keyes.

1723
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:36,110
也许你在跟我学猫玩老鼠
Maybe you were playing cat-and-mouse with me.

1724
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:39,340
也许你一直知道我就是那个人
Maybe you knew all along I was the somebody else.

1725
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:43,940
我得查明白，而我知道去哪查。你的办公室
I had to find out, and I knew where to look. In your office.

1726
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,010
致诺顿先生的备忘录
Memo to Mr. Norton.

1727
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,750
机密。  迪崔克森档案
Confidential. Dietrichson file.

1728
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:21,930
关于你建议
With regard to your proposal to 

1729
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:23,320
监视沃特.奈夫
put Walter Neff under surveillance...

1730
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:25,080
我坚决反对
I disagree absolutely.

1731
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,520
我已调查过他在案发当晚的行踪
I have investigated his movements on the night of the crime...

1732
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:31,430
确定他从下午7：15起一直在公寓
and he's definitely placed in his apartment from 7:15 p.m. On.

1733
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:35,470
况且，我与沃特深交11年...
In addition to this, I have known Neff intimately for 11 years...

1734
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:38,830
我愿意毫无保留的为他担保
and I personally vouch for him without reservation.

1735
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:47,480
而且，沃特.奈夫和菲莉丝.迪崔克森太太
Furthermore, no connection whatsoever has been established...

1736
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:49,910
没有建立任何联系
between Walter Neff and Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...

1737
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,880
而我现在可以指出
whereas I am now able to report 

1738
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,780
她和另一男子
that such a connection has been established...

1739
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:55,980
确有联系
between her and another man.

1740
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:59,020
这人曾被目睹在7月9、10、11
This man has been observed to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...

1741
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:02,460
12、13日晚探访迪崔克森太太
on the nights of July 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.

1742
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,930
我们成功确认该人是尼诺.扎切提
We have succeeded in identifying him as one Nino Zachetti...

1743
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:09,520
前医科学生，28岁...
former medical student, age of 28...

1744
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,870
住在紫丁香苑
residing at Lilac Court Apartments...

1745
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:14,840
北拉布雷亚大道1228号
12281/2 North La Brea Avenue.

1746
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:18,830
我们调查过他在案发当晚的行踪
We have checked Zachetti's movements on the night of the crime...

1747
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:21,710
发现他没有不在场证据
and have found that they cannot be accounted for.

1748
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:25,380
我正准备一份详细报告给你参考
I am preparing a more detailed report for your consideration.

1749
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:27,600
我深信
It is my belief that 

1750
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,150
针对扎切提和迪崔克森太太，我们有足够证据...
we already have sufficient evidence against Zachetti...

1751
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:32,280
让警方采取行动
and Mrs. Dietrichson to justify police action.

1752
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,420
我强烈要求
I strongly urge 

1753
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:35,550
将本案移交...
that this whole matter be turned over to the office...

1754
01:32:35,630 --> 01:32:37,560
地方检察官
of the district attorney.

1755
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:39,720
巴顿.基斯敬上
Respectfully, Barton Keyes.

1756
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:19,630
菲莉丝？是沃特。我得见你。今晚
Phyllis? It's Walter. I've got to see you. Tonight.

1757
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:23,100
是的，必须是今晚
Yes, it has to be tonight.

1758
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:25,110
11点如何？  
How's 11:00?

1759
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:28,080
不用担心基斯
Don't worry about Keyes.

1760
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:31,120
前门不要锁上，把灯关掉就行
Just leave the front door unlocked and put the lights out.

1761
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:34,120
不，没人监视房子，不再有了
No, nobody's watching the house. Not anymore.

1762
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:38,680
只是不想邻居看见。我说过不用担心基斯
It's just for the neighbors. I told you not to worry about Keyes.

1763
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,660
今晚11点见。是的
I'll see you at 11:00. Yeah.

1764
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:45,950
再见，宝贝
Goodbye, baby.

1765
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:51,630
我想我不用告诉你
I guess I don't have to tell you...

1766
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:54,370
11点时我打算干嘛
what I intended to do at 11:00, Keyes.

1767
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:55,960
这是第一次，
For the first time, 

1768
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:58,000
我看到了摆脱这团麻烦的方法...
I saw a way to get clear of the whole mess I was in...

1769
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,910
同时摆脱菲莉丝
and of Phyllis, too, all at the same time.

1770
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:03,370
对，我就是那样想的
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1771
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:07,380
我不知道的是她自有打算
What I didn't know was that she had plans of her own.

1772
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,470
这里，沃特
In here, Walter.

1773
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:24,730
嗨，宝贝
Hello, baby.

1774
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:29,660
-屋里有别人吗？    -没有，怎么了？  
Anybody else in the house? Nobody. Why?

1775
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,100
-什么音乐？    -街外的收音机
What's that music? A radio up the street.

1776
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:45,550
跟我初次来时一样，不是吗？
Just like the first time I came here, isn't it?

1777
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:48,450
我们谈着汽车保险
We were talking about automobile insurance.

1778
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:51,350
你心里却想着谋杀
Only you were thinking about murder.

1779
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:54,330
我在想着那脚链
I was thinking about that anklet.

1780
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:56,260
现在你在想什么？  
And what are you thinking about now?

1781
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:58,630
我已经想清楚了，宝贝
I'm all through thinking, baby.

1782
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:01,100
-我只是来道别     -道别？  
I just came to say goodbye. Goodbye?

1783
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:05,330
-你去哪里？    -要去的是你，宝贝，不是我
Where are you going? You're the one that's going, baby. Not me.

1784
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:08,200
这个街角我就要下电车了
I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner.

1785
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:10,770
别拽词了。有话直说吧。
Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's have it, whatever it is.

1786
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,280
好，我告诉你。我一个朋友有个有趣的理论，
All right, I'll tell you. A friend of mine's got a funny theory.

1787
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,300
他说当两人犯下谋杀
He says when two people commit a murder, 

1788
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:17,650
就像是他们...
it's sort of like they're riding...

1789
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:20,340
一起坐上了电车，谁也不能单独下车
on a trolley car together. One can't get off without the other.

1790
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:22,720
他们被捆在一起，必须继续...
They're stuck with each other and they have to go on...

1791
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:25,090
一路前行直到终点
riding together clear to the end of the line.

1792
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,460
而终站就是坟墓
And the last stop is the cemetery.

1793
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:30,690
-也许他说的有道理     -确实
Maybe he's got something there. You bet he has.

1794
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,530
两个人要一路到终点，好吧
Two people are gonna ride to the end of the line, all right.

1795
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,630
只是我不会是其中一人  
Only I'm not gonna be one of them. 

1796
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:38,040
我找到另一个人替我完成旅程
I've got another guy to finish my ride for me.

1797
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:41,560
-你在说谁？      -一个你的熟人
Just who are you talking about? An acquaintance of yours.

1798
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:42,970
一位扎切提先生
A Mr. Zachetti.

1799
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,840
得了，宝贝，我得以参与此事...
Come on, baby, I just got into this thing...

1800
01:36:44,910 --> 01:36:45,890
只因为我碰巧知道...
because I happen to know 

1801
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:47,540
一些关于保险的事，不是吗？
a little something about insurance, didn't I?

1802
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:48,640
我被利用了
I was a sucker.

1803
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:50,090
钱到手的瞬间
I'd have been brushed off 

1804
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:51,480
你就会甩掉我
just as soon as you got your hands on the money.

1805
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:54,210
-没人想甩掉你     -省省吧，让我来说
Nobody wanted to brush you off. Save it. I'm telling this.

1806
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:56,710
你和那扎切提一直是同伙，不是吗？  
It's been you and that Zachetti guy all along, hasn't it?

1807
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:58,380
那不是真的
That's not true.

1808
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:01,590
真假都没什么不同了
Doesn't make any difference if it's true or not.

1809
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:05,270
重点是，基斯认为扎切提
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti is 

1810
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:06,350
是他要找的人
the one he's been looking for.

1811
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:08,070
没等他搞明白状况
He'll have him in that gas chamber 

1812
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:09,490
他就会送他进毒气室
before he knows what's happened to him.

1813
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:12,940
-我会怎么样呢？    -别傻了，宝贝
What's happening to me all this time? Don't be silly, baby.

1814
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:19,670
你以为你会怎么样？ 
What do you think is gonna happen to you? 

1815
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:22,370
你是他的帮凶，不是吗？
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?

1816
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:23,750
那是基斯的想法
That's what Keyes thinks.

1817
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:26,080
基斯满意我也满意
And what's good enough for Keyes is good enough for me.

1818
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:28,320
也许我不满意，沃特
Maybe it's not good enough for me, Walter. 

1819
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,490
也许我不认可这思路
Maybe I don't go for the idea.

1820
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,420
也许我宁愿开口
Maybe I'd rather talk.

1821
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,200
有时人们会身处无法开口的地方
Sometimes people are where they can't talk. 

1822
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:37,050
比如6尺深的地底
Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

1823
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,250
如果那是你，  
And if it was you, 

1824
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:41,420
他们也会认为是扎切提干的，不是吗？
they'd charge that up to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?

1825
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:45,200
他们当然会，而那就是将要发生的事，宝贝
Sure they would, and that's just what's gonna happen, baby.

1826
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:48,130
因为他今晚会来，15分钟之内
'Cause he's coming here tonight, in about 15 minutes.

1827
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:51,670
警察紧随其后。万事俱备了
With the cops right behind him. It's all taken care of.

1828
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:55,040
那对你来说就万事大吉了，不是吗？ 
That would make everything lovely for you, wouldn't it?

1829
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:56,820
是，必须这样
Right. And it's got to be done 

1830
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:59,020
在你的诉讼开庭前...
before that suit of yours comes to trial...

1831
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:00,550
萝拉有机会开口前...
and Lola gets a chance to sound off...

1832
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:02,700
在他们在庭上让你犯错...
before they trip you up on the stand, 

1833
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:03,850
开始把我一起拖下去前
and you start to go in drag me down with you.

1834
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,320
也许我叫扎切提来  
Maybe I had Zachetti here 

1835
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,260
他们就没机会让我犯错
so they won't get a chance to trip me up...

1836
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:07,760
我们就能拿了钱在一起
so we can get the money and be together.

1837
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:09,440
很动听。再说一遍  
That's cute. Say it again. 

1838
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,290
他初次来这是问我萝拉去哪了
He came here first to ask where Lola was.

1839
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,420
我让他再来。我在做他工作
I made him come back. I was working on him.

1840
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,490
他是那种急性子，很冲动
He's a crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered.

1841
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:17,760
我不断骗他说她另结新欢
I kept hammering into him that she was with another man...

1842
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,770
所以他会因嫉妒而狂怒 
so he'd go into one of his jealous rages, 

1843
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:22,240
然后我会告诉他她在哪儿
and then I'd tell him where she was.

1844
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:25,000
你知道他会怎么对她，是吗，沃特？  
And you know what he would've done to her, don't you, Walter?

1845
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:27,870
是，我这次相信你  
Yeah, and for once I believe you, 

1846
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:29,140
因为这够卑鄙
because it's just rotten enough.

1847
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:31,680
我们都很卑鄙
We're both rotten.

1848
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,450
只是你更卑鄙一点
Only you're a little more rotten.

1849
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,610
你让我去为你搞定你丈夫...
You got me to take care of your husband for you...

1850
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:38,460
然后让扎切提去搞定萝拉， 
and then you got Zachetti to take care of Lola, 

1851
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,220
或许还有我
maybe take care of me, too.

1852
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:40,600
然后又会有人...
Then somebody else would have come along 

1853
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,350
为你搞定扎切提
to take care of Zachetti for you.

1854
01:38:42,430 --> 01:38:45,120
-那就是你的方式，不是吗，宝贝？    -就当是吧
That's the way you operate, isn't it, baby? Suppose it is.

1855
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:48,500
你今晚编的会更好吗？
Is what you've got cooked up for tonight any better?

1856
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:53,030
我不再喜欢这音乐了，介意我关窗户吗？  
I don't like that music anymore. Mind if I close the window?

1857
01:39:13,330 --> 01:39:16,260
你能做的更好，不是吗，宝贝？
You can do better than that, can't you, baby?

1858
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,260
最好再试试
Better try it again.

1859
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:23,370
或许我走近一点儿？
Maybe if I came a little closer?

1860
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:36,370
这样呢？觉得能动手了吗？
How's this? Think you can do it now?

1861
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:47,790
为什么不再开枪，宝贝？ 
Why didn't you shoot again, baby?

1862
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,190
别告诉我...
Don't tell me 

1863
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:57,460
是因为你一直深爱着我
it's because you've been in love with me all this time.

1864
01:39:57,540 --> 01:40:00,990
不，我从没爱过你，沃特，你或任何人
No, I never loved you, Walter, not you or anybody else.

1865
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:04,470
我坏透顶了。像你说的，我利用了你
I'm rotten to the heart. I used you, just as you said.

1866
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,980
那就是你对我的意义
That's all you ever meant to me...

1867
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:09,880
直到一分钟前...
until a minute ago...

1868
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:13,640
当我无法开第二枪
when I couldn't fire that second shot.

1869
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:17,980
我从没想过这会发生在我身上
I never thought that could happen to me.

1870
01:40:18,990 --> 01:40:21,550
-对不起，宝贝，我不相信     -我不是在求你相信
Sorry, baby. I'm not buying. I'm not asking you to buy.

1871
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:23,360
抱着我
Just hold me close.

1872
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,290
再见，宝贝
Goodbye, baby.

1873
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:27,190
扎切提
Zachetti.

1874
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:30,690
过来
Come here.

1875
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:38,230
我叫你过来
I said, come here.

1876
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:44,000
-我叫奈夫    -是的，我还是不喜欢
My name is Neff. Yeah, and I still don't like it.

1877
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,700
你想怎样？  
What do you want?

1878
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:47,080
听着， 孩子
Look, kid.

1879
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:51,510
我想给你个礼物，这个崭新的硬币
I want to give you a present. This nice new nickel.

1880
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:53,740
-搞什么？   -如果你能到山下...  
What's the gag? Suppose you go on back down the hill...

1881
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:55,410
去杂货店打个电话
to the drugstore and make a phone call.

1882
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:57,580
留着你的硬币给自己买个甜筒吧
Keep your nickel and buy yourself an ice-cream cone.

1883
01:41:57,660 --> 01:41:59,420
号码是G0386
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.

1884
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:02,050
找萝拉.迪崔克森小姐，
Ask for Miss Dietrichson. First name is Lola.

1885
01:42:02,130 --> 01:42:03,220
她不值个硬币
She isn't worth a nickel.

1886
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:05,790
如果我要和她谈，绝不会通过电话
If I ever talk to her, it's not going to be over any telephone.

1887
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:06,890
挺牛的，是吗？  
Tough, aren't you?

1888
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:08,990
拿着，去打给她。她需要你
Here, take the nickel and call her. She wants you to.

1889
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:10,830
她一点都不需要我
She doesn't want any part of me.

1890
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:13,660
我知道是谁告诉你的，那不是真的
I know who told you that. It's not true.

1891
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:16,260
萝拉爱你，一直都是
Lola's in love with you. She always has been.

1892
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:18,570
别问我为什么。我也不知道
Don't ask me why. I couldn't even guess.

1893
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:21,910
拿着，G0386，快去打给她
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6. Now go on and call her.

1894
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:24,170
走吧。那边
Go on. That way.

1895
01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:36,590
现在差不多4点半
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

1896
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:39,020
天很冷
It's cold.

1897
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:44,690
我在想她是否仍然独自躺在房中
I wonder if she's still lying alone up there in that house...

1898
01:42:44,770 --> 01:42:46,900
还是他们已经发现了她
or if they've found her by now.

1899
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:51,870
我在想很多事，但已不再重要
I wonder a lot of things. They don't matter anymore.

1900
01:42:56,150 --> 01:42:59,140
除了我想你帮我个忙
Except I want you to do a favor for me, Keyes.

1901
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:03,440
我想由你去告诉萝拉真相
I want you to be the one to tell Lola, 

1902
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:04,960
在闹的满城风雨之前
kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.

1903
01:43:06,630 --> 01:43:10,320
我想你照顾她和那个扎切提
And I want you to take care of her and that guy Zachetti...

1904
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:17,730
让他不用四处碰壁
so he doesn't get pushed around too much.

1905
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:21,170
嗨，基斯
Hello, Keyes.

1906
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,240
起的很早啊，不是吗？
Up pretty early, aren't you?

1907
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:38,020
我一直想知道你几点来办公室
I always wondered what time you got down to the office.

1908
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:41,920
还是你的小人儿叫醒了你？
Or did that little man of yours pull you out of bed?

1909
01:43:41,990 --> 01:43:43,590
看门的找的我
The janitor did.

1910
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:47,060
他看见你来时留下的血迹
Seems you leaked a little blood on the way in here.

1911
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:48,220
对
Yeah.

1912
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:50,570
不算意外
Wouldn't be surprised.

1913
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,570
我想向你解释迪崔克森案子的内情
I wanted to straighten you out on that Dietrichson case.

1914
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:57,340
我明白
So I gather.

1915
01:43:59,010 --> 01:44:02,380
-你站在这里多久了？    -够久了
How long have you been standing there? Long enough.

1916
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:05,440
峰回路转的疯狂故事
Kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it.

1917
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:08,340
你还未完全搞清
One you didn't quite figure out.

1918
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:10,850
不可能全都搞清，沃特
You can't figure them all, Walter.

1919
01:44:11,490 --> 01:44:14,220
对，我猜你不能
That's right. I guess you can't at that.

1920
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:18,090
我猜现在该对我演说了
Now I suppose I get the big speech...

1921
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:22,070
全是重要字眼的那种
the one with all the two-dollar words in it.

1922
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:25,070
来吧，基斯
Let's have it, Keyes.

1923
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:29,640
沃特，你全身湿透
Walter, you're all washed up.

1924
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,770
谢谢，基斯，很快就结束了
Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.

1925
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:38,240
我要叫医生来
I'm gonna call for a doctor.

1926
01:44:40,450 --> 01:44:43,080
干什么？给我包扎？ 
What for? So they can patch me up?

1927
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:46,820
为我治疗，直到我能站稳？
So they can nurse me along till I get back on my feet?

1928
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:48,590
让我能用自己的力气
So I can walk into that gas chamber up 

1929
01:44:48,590 --> 01:44:50,290
走进圣昆廷的毒气室？
at San Quentin on my own power?

1930
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:51,950
是不是，基斯？
Is that it, Keyes?

1931
01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:53,690
差不多
Something like that.

1932
01:44:54,670 --> 01:44:56,960
-我有另一个提议   -是吗？
I've got a different idea. Yeah?

1933
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:58,400
听着，基斯
Look, Keyes.

1934
01:44:58,770 --> 01:45:01,170
不如你回床上，假装明早来上班时，
Suppose you went back to bed and didn't find these cylinders...

1935
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,610
才发现这些录音带
till tomorrow morning, when the office opens...

1936
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:06,270
然后你想怎么干都行
After that you can play it any way you like.

1937
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:08,940
能为我这么做吗，基斯？
Would you do that much for me, Keyes?

1938
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:10,890
给我一个好理由  
Give me one good reason. 

1939
01:45:10,890 --> 01:45:13,150
我要4小时才能到达目的地
I need four hours to get where I'm going.

1940
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:16,420
-你哪里也去不成，沃特      -我能
You're not going anywhere, Walter. You bet I am.

1941
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:20,220
-我要越过边境     -你没有机会的，沃特
I'm going across the border. You haven't got a chance, Walter.

1942
01:45:20,290 --> 01:45:21,850
试试无妨
Good enough to try for.

1943
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:25,360
-你到不了边境        -那是你以为
You'll never make the border. That's what you think.

1944
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:27,550
看我的吧
Just watch me.

1945
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,160
你连电梯都到不了
You'll never even make the elevator.

1946
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:31,390
再见，基斯
So long, Keyes.

1947
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:02,330
喂  
Hello...

1948
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:05,030
派救护车到橄榄街的太平洋大厦
send an ambulance to the Pacific Building on Olive Street.

1949
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,210
对，需要报警
Yeah. It's a police job.

1950
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:31,590
-你还好吗，沃特？     -还好
How you doing, Walter? Fine.

1951
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:37,360
只是有人将电梯移到几里外了
Only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away.

1952
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:39,670
他们正赶来
They're on the way.

1953
01:46:44,010 --> 01:46:46,640
你知道你为什么搞不清这案子吗，基斯？
You know why you couldn't figure this one, Keyes?

1954
01:46:46,710 --> 01:46:48,200
我告诉你
I'll tell you.

1955
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:52,010
因为你要找的人太近了
Because the guy you were looking for was too close.

1956
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,710
他就坐在你办公桌对面
He was right across the desk from you.

1957
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:56,910
比那更近，沃特
Closer than that, Walter.

1958
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:02,580
我也爱你
I love you, too.
