1
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,610
Finally l saw the status of Yokogawa

2
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,680
and Tokyo in bomb

3
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,710
l stared the view of
both side of the road.

4
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,850
And the expression of the men
and lady on the road.

5
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,320
my impression is...

6
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,360
the factories in Yokogawa
and Tokyo are disappeared in the bomb.

7
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,330
This time l felt the truth meaning.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,760
whatever men or lady

9
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,770
they and what l saw
before 22 years in Japan.

10
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,370
already so much difference.

11
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,330
Who changed it?

12
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,470
it cannot do not let them take it...

13
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,370
Who we are going to judge.

14
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,880
they disturbed the world.

15
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,170
tormented China.

16
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,680
And ruined the future of their country.

17
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,020
a state had good future.

18
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,890
therefore result in the fate.

19
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,030
Do evil by themselves.

20
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,190
this is a tragedy in the history

21
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,200
Also an retribution

22
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,430
We affirm that,

23
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,900
as members of the lnternational
Military Tribunal for the Far East,

24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,280
we will duly administer
justice according to law,

25
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,320
without fear, favor or affection,

26
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,290
according to our conscience,
and the best of our understanding,

27
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,590
and that we will not disclose
or discover

28
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,810
the vote or opinion of any
particular member of the Tribunal

29
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,200
upon finding or sentence,

30
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,940
but will preserve the inviolate secrecy

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,580
of the counsel of every member.

32
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,890
We swear to God.

33
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,980
Please sit down.

34
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,890
Before we start, there are a few things
l would like to clarify

35
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,160
First of all,

36
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,490
we don't need to be overly polite

37
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,430
among ourselves.

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,760
Please just call me William.

39
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,810
We should treat each other as equals

40
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,270
and consider ourselves one big family.

41
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,880
l hope this would be a pleasant experience

42
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,380
for all of us.

43
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,340
As this trial will be conducted

44
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,680
on the basis of the Common Law System,

45
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,930
the seating of the judges
will be as follows:

46
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:53,890
The United States, Britain,
China, the Soviet Union, Canada

47
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,160
France, Australia, the Netherlands,

48
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,670
lndia, New Zealand, and the Philippines.

49
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,200
l will not accept that arrangement.

50
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,980
Pardon me. What do you mean?

51
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,770
l believe the seating order of the judges
in this trial should follow the order

52
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,940
of signatures on
the Japanese lnstrument of Surrender.

53
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,750
China was second on the list.

54
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,220
Therefore, the judge from China should be
seated right after the United States.

55
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,820
My dear Mei, this is a courtroom,
not a reenactment of surrender.

56
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,390
Then perhaps,

57
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,930
Sir William could explain his reasons
for this arrangement?

58
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,870
Dr. Mei, this is has been
the common practice.

59
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,540
What common practice? Whose practice?

60
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,230
lsn't following the order of signatures in
the lnstrument of Surrender a common practice?

61
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,710
Dr. Mei, we are here to
judge war criminals.

62
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,880
Why are you making fuss

63
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,310
over such a trivial matter?

64
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,920
This is no trivial matter.

65
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,380
Besides, Our concern here is what's
right and what's wrong.

66
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,150
There's nothing trivial about it.

67
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,290
Dr. Mei, then please suggest a fair method.

68
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,660
lf we are not going to follow the order
on the lnstrument of Surrender...

69
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,370
Maybe... it might even be the fairest...

70
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,510
we'll put ourjudges on the scale,

71
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,140
and the seating arrangement
will be determined by weight

72
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,740
Dr. Mei, the method you suggest
is eminently fair,

73
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,350
but would only be appropriate
for boxing matches.

74
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,050
This is a courtroom, not a boxing ring.

75
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,120
lf the seating arrangement is
not to be determined by weight,

76
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,190
then the only fair method
is to follow the order

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
on the Japanese lnstrument of Surrender.

78
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,700
l have no wish at all to allow
this international tribunal

79
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,430
to become a boxing ring.

80
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,780
Stop!

81
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:31,980
Chinese pig! Get out of Japan!

82
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,400
We were beaten to American,

83
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,410
Not China! Get out!

84
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,200
Cooperate with US.
Gendarme, finished the enquiry.

85
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,770
driver was kept back temporarily.

86
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,600
For the further enquiry

87
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,380
xiao Nan and
l was both ashamed to the driver.

88
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,100
Also sigh with emotion.

89
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,850
Come in.

90
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,540
Dr Mei,

91
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,490
there will be a rehearsal for tomorrow's
opening ceremony at 4:00 this afternoon.

92
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,790
Please be there on time
and wear yourjudicial robe;

93
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,620
photographers will be present.

94
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,600
Thank you

95
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,980
Good afternoon, sit down.

96
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,760
Since the lnternational Military Tribunal
for the Far East formally

97
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,790
begins hearing its cases tomorrow,

98
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:56,560
l will announce the seating order of
the judges for final dress rehearsal today...

99
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,460
The seating order

100
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,430
of the judges is as follows:

101
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:07,510
United States, Britain,
China, the Soviet Union, Canada,

102
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,480
France, Australia, the Netherlands, lndia,

103
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,820
New Zealand and the Philippines...

104
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,760
Dr. Mei, please let me explain.

105
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,860
Please calm down and listen

106
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,400
l'm listening

107
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,410
The main reason l placed the American
and British judges on my left and right

108
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,380
is because they have a better

109
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,480
understanding of the Common Law,

110
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,970
which would make this
trial fun more smoothly.

111
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,910
This decision absolutely does not reflect
any prejudice against China...

112
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,680
Forgive me for being frank.

113
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,020
We all know that this is
an international tribunal,

114
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,850
not British or American.

115
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,630
l don't see any need to seat the American
and British judges in the center.

116
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,700
Dr. Mei,

117
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,200
please look at this problem
from a different angle.

118
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,130
With this arrangement,

119
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,770
you will be seated between
the American and French judges,

120
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,930
instead of next to the Russian general.

121
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,970
l would imagine that would please you.

122
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,010
Sir William, that's insulting.

123
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,940
As a Chinese,

124
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,680
it is my solemn duty to remind you

125
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,250
that l didn't come to Tokyo to be pleased.

126
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,680
My homeland China has been invaded

127
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,460
and plundered by the Japanese
for over fifty years.

128
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,770
To the Chinese people,
trying Japanese war criminals

129
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,330
is a heavy responsibility,
a grave responsibility.

130
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,560
We are not here for pleasure.

131
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,330
Doctor Mei, l would like to
solemnly remind you as well that.

132
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,380
this seating arrangement
originated from an order given

133
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,570
by the Supreme Commander,
General MacArthur himself

134
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,150
lt would be extremely unfortunate if your
refusal to accept this seating arrangement

135
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,020
were to cause friction
in Chinese-American relations.

136
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,080
Your government might not
agree with your decisions.

137
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,820
l refuse to accept this arrangement
that has ground at all in any law or reason.

138
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,760
ln this war against Japanese aggression

139
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,100
China has suffered the most
and fought the longest,

140
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,530
the hardest.

141
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:17,200
The Britain, on the other hand, has been
retreating and surrendering time and time again.

142
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,810
lt's unthinkable that
China's place in this trial

143
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,780
should be relegated to
a spot below Britain.

144
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,720
l do not believe the government of
China will agree to this arrangement...

145
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,490
ln addition,

146
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,290
l don't believe that this seating arrangement
came from the Supreme Commander himself

147
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,640
Hold on. Let me discuss this
with the otherjudges first.

148
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,330
l'll have an answer for you in ten minutes.

149
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,690
Dr. Mei, l'm sorry to disappoint you,

150
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,670
but my colleagues unanimously see today
just as a dress rehearsal

151
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,030
and nothing more.

152
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,600
Why don't we just take
a few pictures at the rehearsal now,

153
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,610
and then tonight we'll open
a full discussion regarding

154
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,180
the actual seating order of
tomorrow's court?

155
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,350
Sir William,
l have to disappoint you as well.

156
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,120
l definitely will not participate in
the rehearsal for this seating arrangement.

157
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,920
The whole world's photographers

158
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,690
and reporters in rehearsal
are now out there in the courtroom.

159
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,200
They are going to take photos

160
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,060
and write reports on this seating arrangement.

161
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,100
When these reports and photos reach China,

162
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,940
do you know what's going to happen?

163
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,740
The entire Chinese people will all
reproach me for my weakness

164
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,680
and my incompetence.

165
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,780
lf l agree to this arrangement,

166
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,610
l'll be insulting my country.

167
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,380
l'd be insulting

168
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,950
all my countrymen's suffering,

169
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,320
sacrifice, and perseverance
in resisting the Japanese aggression.

170
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,930
Everything.

171
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,360
Sir William, can you understand?

172
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,200
lt is for this reason that
l will not take take in this rehearsal.

173
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,310
As for myself, l will report the matter back
to my government to see if they support me.

174
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,080
lf they don't, l shall resign immediately
and ask them to replace me.

175
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,260
Please do not leave. How about this?

176
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,860
l'll get our colleagues' opinion
on this again

177
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,990
l absolutely don't want you to go.

178
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,000
l'll be back in no more than ten minutes.

179
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,900
Alright, l'll wait another ten minutes.

180
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,630
Dr. Mei, you win.

181
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,560
Your country should be

182
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,500
proud to have a fighter like you.

183
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:17,270
l'm not a fighter.
l'm ajudge, a Chinese judge.

184
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,740
My dear Mei, can you do me a little favor?

185
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,410
Of course.

186
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,790
Call me William.

187
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,880
William.

188
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,180
Good evening, please give me some wine.

189
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,490
Yousuko,

190
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,560
come here and join us

191
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,390
What's a pity, maybe next time will be ok.

192
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:52,090
For Japan's failuer, cheers!

193
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,790
Mr Shino,
we have promised that we don't talk

194
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,830
bout the War any more!

195
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,770
Don't talk about the War

196
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,210
For our friendship, cheers

197
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,380
But Japan failed in the war

198
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,160
Japan really failed?

199
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,300
What's the purprose for your coming back?

200
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,560
With the prond of a winner,

201
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,970
to display your strength to us?

202
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,080
Or to talk about the past with Yousuko?

203
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:48,580
Do you know how Yousuko survived

204
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,160
in the American army's bombs?

205
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,160
American army throw out 2500 tons of bombs,

206
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:06,860
Tokyo's 35 sections were blowed down,
80000 people losed their lives

207
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:14,780
ln Hiroshima

208
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,180
and Nagazaki,

209
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,250
10000 people were died

210
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,700
They were all common people

211
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,740
Did they have any fault?

212
00:20:53,990 --> 00:21:03,090
But do you konw hao many people died
in Shanghai and Nanjing?

213
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,160
Wuhan bomb, Chongqing bomb,

214
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,460
Huabei butcher,

215
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,730
Do you konw how many Chinese common people

216
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,570
died in Japan Army?

217
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,210
Do you know how
many Chinese women were raped?

218
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,970
That's a lie!

219
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:35,490
That's a lie for your political purpose!

220
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,490
Were there any turth

221
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:52,170
in your newspaper?

222
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,470
Youiqi!

223
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:14,090
You care about him?

224
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,100
The family

225
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,500
due to the war.

226
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,400
lost happiness.

227
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,610
Fangzi talk to xiaoNan.

228
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,540
brother and ZhengFu
were back from the war,

229
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,810
drunk everyday.

230
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,580
Nobody know

231
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,050
what happen in china.

232
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,690
Fang Zi and her sister YingZi.

233
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,320
since they have left school,
for responsing the Dong Tiao council.

234
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,480
joined the battle service group.

235
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,650
Have never been heard of since.

236
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,270
xiao Nan is the journalist

237
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,200
who was sent to Tokyo
by Dagong Newspaper

238
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,370
before the war starting

239
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,670
he was studying at Tokyo,

240
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,930
Fangzi and xiaonan were his classmate.

241
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,380
xiang, try to look
a little more enthusiastic.

242
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,550
Don't forget this is a historic moment.

243
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,250
The whole world is watching us!

244
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,230
This whole situation just makes me
a little uncomfortable.

245
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,000
What's that?

246
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,430
l feel like l'm putting on a show here.

247
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,700
Court.

248
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,490
Please sit down.

249
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,440
The lnternational Military Tribunal
for the Far East is now in session.

250
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,140
All the defendants of this case

251
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,970
were once leaders of Japan
for the past several decades

252
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,980
when Japanese power was at its peak.

253
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,210
They include prime ministers,
foreign ministers,

254
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,590
treasury ministers, chiefs of staff
and military high commanders.

255
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,060
No matter how high they once stood,

256
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,690
their treatment now is no different from

257
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,030
that of the lowest of ordinary soldiers.

258
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,270
We will assure the defendants

259
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,200
that a careful examination will be made

260
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,110
before this court regarding
the number and nature

261
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,520
of the prosecution charges filed
against them in the indictment,

262
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,960
along with the declaration of
all the applicable laws.

263
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,910
Honorable presiding judge
and members of the court,

264
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,610
l am Joseph Keenan,

265
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,320
the chief prosecutor for this lnternational
Military Tribunal for the Far East

266
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,820
and for the United States of America,

267
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:02,490
The charter of the lnternational Military
Tribunal for the Far East clearly stipulates

268
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,430
five separate charges with which
the defendants have been indicted,

269
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,230
as listed:

270
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,960
premeditation, organization,

271
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,140
initiation, and
or execution of a war

272
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:23,150
in violation of international law,

273
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,350
treaties, agreements or assurances.

274
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,480
ln addition to these charges,

275
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:40,800
participation in a common plan
or conspiracy for the accomplishment

276
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,200
of any of the foregoing is also
an offense against humanity...

277
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,740
Toujyou, l'll kill you

278
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,940
l'll kill you

279
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,770
Bring this people out of the court.

280
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,410
l'll kill you

281
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:04,450
Next,

282
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,490
the lnternational Military Tribunal for
the Far East will hear the defendants' please

283
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,130
to the charges brought by the prosecution.

284
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:26,240
l ask Mr Web for blench this justment.

285
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,910
Anyone with any objections
on how this courtroom

286
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,070
is ran should put them in writing.

287
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,880
The defense's oral argument

288
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,040
is completely out of line.

289
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,850
This is an despicable ambush comparable
to the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.

290
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,460
l insisted on my request.

291
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,560
and l challenge

292
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,170
the qualification of all judges.

293
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,730
Control yourself.
He's provoking you on purpose.

294
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,750
This trial totally base on

295
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,540
the haughty and bias of the Kultur.

296
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,890
base on the nongovernmental spirit that
winner is king and the loser is thief.

297
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,590
judging the civilian life

298
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,890
who exert their utmost effort

299
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,900
for asia peace and co-prosperity.

300
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,670
l doubt the court's equity.

301
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,870
also feel sorrow
for the dignity of the law.

302
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,350
Silence! Mr. Defense attorney,

303
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:39,280
the courtroom is not preaching grounds for
your theories or for your to set conditions.

304
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,450
Your first point concerns me personally.

305
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,580
Therefore, l withhold myself

306
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,420
from the decision the otherjudges will
make in a conference later.

307
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,190
l also don't think the other ten judegs

308
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:58,000
have the qualification of
the lnternational Military Tribunal.

309
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,810
So l think the conference ofjudges
will not be fair, too.

310
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,340
l object!

311
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,500
Then in your opinion,
what do you think would be fair?

312
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,510
Super court in United States of America.

313
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,680
That's completely out of question!
Court is adjourned.

314
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,660
How could an international court

315
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,390
compose of eleven judges appointed by
their respective democratic governments

316
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,900
and organized by the best
minds of international law

317
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,700
lack the decorum of one

318
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,270
federal court?

319
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,100
This is absolute provocation.

320
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,400
Since l've been the target,

321
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,980
l'm willing to abide by
the ruling of a conference ofjudges.

322
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,750
Ougawajyumei which seemed crazy at court

323
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,050
was theorist of the Japanese
racialism and militaristic.

324
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,020
And the September eighteen

325
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,160
incident's direct organizer.

326
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,520
after identified by allied
forces' legal medical expert.

327
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,920
identified he had syphilis
cephalitis and anoia.

328
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,790
Lose ability that identify yes or no.

329
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,490
in this trial

330
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,860
Only one escaped from war
criminal depend on malinger.

331
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,330
a senior reporter say--

332
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,610
Ougawa is a craze

333
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,870
adventurer, typical ruffian.

334
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,710
fancy of great empire filled
with his brain.

335
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,990
After our discussion, the ten judges
unanimously agreed

336
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,160
with the second article of the Tribunal,

337
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:39,000
specifying the Allies's Supreme Commander's
ability to appoint judges to this court

338
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:45,370
on the basis of recommendations from
their respective national governments.

339
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,840
Therefore, we do not possess the power

340
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:54,080
to decide appointment, dismissal,
or withdrawal of any judge.

341
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,620
That means the guilt or
innocence of the 28 defendants

342
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,490
must be based on the final
verdict of this military tribunal.

343
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,750
Next, we will hear
the defendants' plea to the charges.

344
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,060
The 28 accused shall now state whether
they plea guilty or not guilty to the charges

345
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,430
the prosecution brought against
them in the indictment

346
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,770
of the lnternational Military Tribunal.

347
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,610
Defendant Sadao Araki, how do you plea,
guilty or not guilty?

348
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,140
l petiton the court to let
my lawyer answer the question.

349
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:36,190
Petition denied.
The court requires you to speak for yourself.

350
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,730
l'm not guilty.

351
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,390

358
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,180
l'm not guilty.

359
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,620
l objected the indictment,

360
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,820
l'm not guilty.

361
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,260
Japanese criminal defend
team's vice leader,

362
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,760
Who was also Hideki Tojyo's attorney,

363
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:16,700
Named Hirose itiro,

364
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,840
Built a defend team composed of
over one hundred people.

365
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,600
They used Long-term stratagem,

366
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,940
Never stop to make incident,

367
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,980
ln order to throw the court into confusion,

368
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,910
Which made the trial get along.

369
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,100
lt was no so bad as you thought,

370
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,030
l think we must win in first section,

371
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,600
Mr. Kinan and l have prepared two weapons,

372
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,610
They must recive applause.

373
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,200
The fish was finished,

374
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,580
Landlady,

375
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,440
Your Chinese was so perfect!

376
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,020
Mr. Kitano,

377
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,730
Your brither Gunni was died in the war,

378
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,040
lf you have time tommorrow,

379
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,730
Please come to the police office
to affirm the reliquary.

380
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,680
Hello

381
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,990
Gunni died.

382
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,670
Gunni died.

383
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,770
Gunni died.

384
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,100
lt was your Chinese who killed Gunni.

385
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,520
Go away.

386
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,710
l'll kill you

387
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:57,720
lt is you who killed my brother.

388
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,360
Kitano's brother Gunni

389
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,160
Was sent to China together with Hideo,

390
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,970
Hideo came back Japan now,

391
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,660
But Gunni was died.

392
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,740
Kitano's animosity to Chinses,

393
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,170
Was increased by Gunni's death,

394
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,940
Which made us anxious.

395
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,080
ln that time,

396
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,340
Tokyo was involved into the animosity,

397
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,280
Which was derived from the war to Chinese.

398
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,290
When was the beginning of
the Japan-China war,

399
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,870
That was the most
important point we concerned

400
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,630
On China in the Tokyo trial

401
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,710
After the Guandong Army
entered the Northeast China,

402
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,680
Their frequently defiance action,

403
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,780
Made China-japan relationship
in this area tense up.

404
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,750
ln the end, the China-japan war began with

405
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,250
Guanggutun lncident,
which was premeditated by Japan Army.

406
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:10,630
Mr. District attorney
arbitrarily accused that

407
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,740
the Huanggutun accident were the begining

408
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:19,240
of the Japanese aggression towards China,

409
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,650
it against the truth,

410
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:29,210
obviously,
it also confused the partly conflict

411
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,550
and formal war.

412
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,460
At the time, the Beijing government

413
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,460
was the only Chinese government recognized
by the international community

414
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,570
and as such it had diplomatic
relations with other countries.

415
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,300
And, Zhang Zuolin was
the head of that government.

416
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,410
l would like to ask the defense,

417
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,050
when one country plots

418
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:03,590
and succeeds in the assassination
of the head of another government,

419
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:10,220
if that is not an act of war between
the two countries, then what is it

420
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,860
Dose Mr. District attorney have
any evidence to proof that

421
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:20,660
The Huanghutun accident
was done by Japanese army?

422
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,800
This is a deposition given by the former

423
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,540
Japanese Navy Minister Keisuke Okada.

424
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,710
Mr. District attorney

425
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:38,120
How could we believe the words

426
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,320
a navy officer said?

427
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,090
Then who could give evidence
that these events took place?

428
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,090
Of course the lieutenant officer.

429
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,930
Your Honor,

430
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,260
the prosecution would like to call the former
lieutenant general of the Japanese Army

Your profession?

440
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:47,060
The former lieutenant
general of the Japanese Army

441
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,520
What was your rank and post
before your military retirement?

442
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,830
The former lieutenant general,

00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:59,370
and former head of the
Japanese Army lnternal Affairs Office

444
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,600
Are you familiar
with the Huanggutun lncident

445
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,640

446
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,640
Yes

447
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:13,450
Do you know who killed Zhang Zuolin?

448
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,080
l had researched the files,

449
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:21,520
lt was planed and carried out
by the former brainman of the Guandong Army,

450
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,190
lwamoto ousaku.

451
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,900
Order! Order!

452
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,000
On June third, 1928,

453
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,640
At the across of Nanman railway
and Jingfeng railway,

454

Asaki News Paper said,

497
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,870

in the period of Tokyo trial.

499
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,310
by Japan empire in the past.

actually attended the court
and bear witness

502
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:11,850
Never in the past.

503
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,760
When you were emperor of Manchukuo,

504
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,820
what rights did you have?

505
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,830
l don't have any right,

506
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,860
everything was determined by Japanese Army.

507
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,760
Absolutely everything?

508
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,960
Yes

509
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:31,310
Oh, l have only one right,

510
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,440
What was that?

511
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,800
The right they ask me

512
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,910
everything to do.

513
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:41,180
During this period,
did you have freedom of movement?

514
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,480
Freedom?

515
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,510
During the these years,

516
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,020
l didn't have any freedom,

517
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,360
Just like a monky!

518
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,830
Mr. witness,

519
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,560
The words you said to the brother

520
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,230
of the Japanese Emperor,

521
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,470
ls said by yourself, is that right?

522
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,480
That was prepared by them.

523
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:17,450
My question was is that said by yourself?

524
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,590
You just need to answer me yes or no.

525
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:21,920
Yes

526
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:24,520
Why there were tears in your eyes?

527
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,790
Why were you crying?

528
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:32,490
Was that because the help

529
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,230
of Japanese Emperor?

530
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:37,670
Was that because the fervor
of the Japanese people?

531
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,510
Please answer me.

532
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,240
Why were you crying?

533
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,120
That was a act.

534
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,790
You are lying.

535
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,460
You are a lier.

536
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,300
You put all your crime on Japanese,

537
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:06,560
but you actually a criminal.

538
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,430
Finally you will be judged
by Chinese government

539
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,440
as a war criminal

540
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,150
8 whole days.

541
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,680
PuYi made it in the Tokyo trial.

542
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,260
the longest witness record.

543
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:30,030
fight against the Guang Lai Yi Lang

544
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:35,000
Criminal's lawyer group
threatened and terrified

545
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,970
27-Aug

546
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,730
after the last time witness,

547
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,840
PuYi left the court under
the protection of Russia and U.S.

548
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,110
PuYi's witness

549
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,300
proved that Japan invaded ManZhouLi,
directly.

550
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,950
lt is a unlawful aggression.

551
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,290
because Japan carried out
the news forbiding

552
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,480
and forbidden the Japanese army
contacting to home.

553
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,720
cannot mention the criminal
and wrongdoing actions

554
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,420
during the war period.

555
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,060
civilians in Japan

556
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:12,460
to the action butchering captive
and civilians

557
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,500
few people know it.

558
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,370
even many Japanese,

559
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,100
Do not believe the Nanjing massacre.

560
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,700
l suggested

561
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,710

take the Nanjing massacre

562
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,320
Be a unit to judge.

563
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:00,510
There was no butcher in Nanjing,

564
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,280
Like procurator Kinan said,

565
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,150
what Japanese army did,

566
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,290
to Chinese common people and women,

567
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,950
the accusation which organized

568
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,060
and inhumane butcher and rape,

569
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,470
were all libel.

570
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:24,340
Further more, the accusation
which over military necessary,

571
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:29,710

and wealth were all lies.

after the Japanese Army entered Nanjing.

586
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:12,120
Nanjing became hell on earth!

587
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:17,090
the Japanese army went into a killing
frenzy burning everything in sight.

588
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,690
Endless looting and rape.

589
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,530

Where were you on December 13, 1397

when the Japanese Army entered Nanjing?

606
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,560
Did you leave the temple at any time?

607
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,670
We leaved.

608

We meet some Japanese solider,

612
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:15,910
and then they caught us.

613
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,810
How many of them were there
and what were they doing?

614
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,690
They had over ten persons,
they were raping a Chinese girl.

615
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,890
What did they want you to do

616
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,490
They asked us to rape the Chinese girl too.

617
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:31,700
Did you rape her?

618
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:32,860
No

619
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,300
What happened next?

620
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,370
They used bayonet,

621
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,600
And ask us to put off our clothes

622
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,440
They ask us to rape that Chinese girl.

623
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,710
Otherwise, they will kill us.

624
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,850
And then...

625
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,350
Mr. Mingxin didn't answer their request,

626
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,450
What did they do to Mingxin?

627
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,910
They cut off Mingxin's

628
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,550
sexual organ.

629
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,390
Did Mingxin die?

630
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:10,960
He was rolling in the grond

631
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,840
The blood was all around his body

632
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,360
What about the Japanese soldiers?

633
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:18,910
What did they do?

634
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,540
Laughing, they were all laughing.

635
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,910
Then what happened to the rest of you?

636
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,380
Mr. Mingkong and Mingfa also
didn't answer their request,

637
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:33,780
Did the Japanese soldiers also

638
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,520
cut off their sexual organs?

639
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:38,660
Yes

640
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,430
Did they live?

641
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:42,600
No

642
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,680
You just said that,

643
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:13,860
The Japanese soldiers ask you
and three teal monks

644
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:16,760
To rape that Chinese girl

Yes

646
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,460
They all didn't agree,

647
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,870
so at last they died, is that right?

648
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,440
Yes

649
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:31,010
And you? Why were you survive?

650
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,620

Yes, l raped her.

654
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:53,470
Were you really forced to do

655
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:59,440
Or yourself also want to do this?

656
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:09,020
How can you proof yourself
were forced to do?

657
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:16,460
How can you proof you were not willing to?

658
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,190
Damn it!

659
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,030
Asshole! Damn it!

660
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,210
The war between Japan and China,

661
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:40,340
Just as the bust up between
the brothers of the Asia Big Family.

662
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:45,820
Japan have no choice

663
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,220
but to use some strong measure.

664
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:53,390
This is just as after the brother keep
his temper for a long time

665
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,720
he'll drive his little brother away.

666
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:07,770
This is in order to make
China change his view.

667
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:13,080
Maybe our attitude was a little wildness,

668
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,150
But the original purpose was
to do some good things,

669
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:21,150
The elder brother was loving
the little brother.

670
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,190
And might l ask

671
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:29,760
how the younger brother responded to
his older brother's solicitude?

672
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:37,840
The little brother didn't
understand our purpose.

673
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:44,540
He still didn't enjoy this love.

674
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,410
Don't talk about the Brothers any more!

675
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,450
Totally bullshit!

676
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:49,780
Bullshit!

677
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,460
ln the last verdict of
the international tribunal,

678
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:05,000
To the Nanjing Butcher in China,

679
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:06,600
This cognizance was made,

680
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:07,900
ln the first six weeks

681
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,300
of the Japanese aggression,

682
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,310
The number of innocent people
who were butchered

683
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,500
Was over two hundred thousand.

684
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:16,880
This was the most discreet estimation

685
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:19,240
Of the international military tribunal.

686
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,740
The number Chinese government
announced later

687
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,850
Made it clearly that

688
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,680
ln Nanjing

689
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,090
There were three hundred thousand people

690
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,780
were killed by Japanese Army.

691
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,490
Sakurako,

692
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:08,190
Sakura was Fangzi's sister,
she came back from China,

693
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,600
She joined battle service group

694
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,770
for the enthusiasm of dedication
to Japanese Army,

695
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:16,700
but finally become sex tool for them.

696
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,640
Welcome!

697
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,480
Hideo, is this Mr. Hideo?

698
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,270
That's very fine! You are still living.

699
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:30,150
Please sit down,
You'll be free drinking today.

700
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,930
lt's so good to see you alive.

701
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,790
Mr. xiaonan,

702
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,030
Do you familiar with that person?

703
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,300
He's the brother of one of my friends.

704
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,330
That's fine!

705
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:50,700
An old friend come here,
free drinking today.

706
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,980
Mr. Hideo, don't you really remember me?

707
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:00,910
Do you know each other

708
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,860
Hideo,

709
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,040
Please forgive me.

710
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,290
Don't believe Chinese people.

711
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,860
l believe my own judge only.

712
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:51,530
Yousuko, don't forget that you're Japanese.

713
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,300
Yousuko Yousuko

714
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,310
Mr. Hideo.

715
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,070
What happened to my brother?

716
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,750
Your brother is in the pothouse now

717
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,860
Brother, what's wrong with you

718
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:39,850
You Chinese people are still
so savage in our country.

719
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,580
l'll kill you

720
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,150
Hideo,

721
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,130
Kill these Chinese.

722
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:59,970
lt's them who make Japan
become a humiliator.

723
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:07,370
lt's them who make Japan
become a humiliator.

724
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:12,440
lt's them who make us become orphan.

725
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,980
Japanese devil!

726
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:24,960
No.

727
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,100
Brother!

728
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,630
Brother!

729
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:38,470
lt had been one year when l came to Tokyo,

730
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,840
Not only the Chinese government

731
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,100
But also l, the party judge,

732
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,470
Was never thought that

733
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,680
A legality trial

734
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,180
Which the winner country
to the defeat country

735
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,880
Became so difficult and complex.

736
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,850
Here also has joy,

737
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,890
But not to me

738
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,720
lt belong to other people

739
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,160
l'm just a visitor.

740
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,240
The criminals'individual defendance started,

741
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:11,000
What made the pressure of Mr.xiang

742
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,200
Was the trial to

743
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:15,400
Doihara kenji and ltagaki siro.

744
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:18,970
These two criminals was the leader of

745
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:21,170
The Japanese-Chinese aggression.

746
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,790
Which made the Chinese people
into pain and suffer.

747
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,050
lf we were beaten by them in the court.

748
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,420
The result will not image.

749
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:31,860
The situation was that

750
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:35,620
Doihara kenji kept silence until the end.

751
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:39,730
He tried to get rid of the trial with
the loophole of Common Law System

752
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,900
ltagaki siro was crankiness.

753
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:45,600
He wrote a 48-pages long apologia,

754
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,770
Said that he would fight with

755
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,740
The Chinese prosecution team.

756
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:55,580
Mr.Ni zhengao was the leader of this team,

757
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,350
He came Tokyo to help Mr.Mei.

758
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:03,380
For all of accusations.

759
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,190
My party-

760
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,360
Mr. Doihara denied all.

761
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:09,520
further more he also think

762
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,290
that facing all accusation,

763
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:14,900
He absolutely think it
scorn to argue with accuser.

764
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:19,900
therefore for a Japanese army's reverence

765
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:24,200
He gave up justification for themselves.

766
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:30,820
l denied all accusations.

767
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,260
Can Japanese government

768
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:37,890
seeing the Northeast people

769
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,390
live in tribulation and scuffle?

770
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:46,330
We help them out of pity and friendship.

771
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,060
ls it the guilt?

772
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:53,140
Since l was charged of landtied officer.

773
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,610
l always persist in withdraw,

774
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,300
peace, armistice.

775
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,390
whatever what accusal will be
sentenced by prosecution team

776
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:08,490
l always be one of Japanese
who love peace!

777
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:12,190
l'm not guilty.

778
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:17,260
You just said that
the September 18 lncident,

779
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:22,140
also known as the battle
on September 18, 1931,

780
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,440
was never premeditated,

781
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,700
nor a conspiracy. ls that correct?

782
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:28,040
Yes

783
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:35,180
However, you admitted earlier that
the Kuandong Army did formulate a battle plan

784
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,410
before the Huanggutun lncident.

785
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,120
Did you not agree to do it?

786
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,320
l have to explain

787
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,530
this battle plan to you.

788
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,060
l don't want to hear your explanations!

789
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,660
My question is,

790
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:53,060
Did you report the battle plan
to the central command,

791
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,210
and did they approve it?

792
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,370
Yes

793
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:02,870
Then, how can you perpetuate your
statement of no premeditation

794
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:06,480
and conspiracy for
the September 18 lncident?

795
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:11,780
Because comparing our Guangdong army
with Chinese Northeast army,

796
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:18,320
for military strength,
we are in inferior position by 1:20

797
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:21,030
Therefor we must prevent their attack.

798
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,360
we just self-defence.

799
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,730
How did you know the Northeast Army
was going to attack you

800
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,460
We received some information,

801
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:33,470
After that we start making this plan.

802
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,770
The information on hand? What information

803
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:40,310
Mr. ltagaki,

804
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,810
don't forget you're in a courtroom.

805
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:44,780
Only the evidence matters.

806
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:47,960
So, if you are going to testify
that the Northeast Army

807
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:51,290
was about to launch an attack
on the Japanese Army,

808
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,820
then you have to provide proof.

809
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:59,160
ln your defense brief,

810
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:02,170
you stated that during
the negotiations for

811
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:07,210
the Three Power Accord between Japan,
Germany and ltaly

812
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:10,070
you didn't advocate expanding the war.

813
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,940
ln addition,
when the Changgufeng lncident occurred

814
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,750
on the border between China
and the Soviet Union,

815
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:21,520
you tirelessly sought a peaceful solution.
ls that right?

816
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:22,660
Yes

817
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:26,560
As a result,
your emperor punished you for your actions.

818
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:27,990
ls that correct

819
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:31,930
lsn't that right?

820
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:33,190
How did you know this?

821
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:35,000
l'm the one asking questions here,

822
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:36,230
not you.

823
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:38,670
Answer me, lsn't that right?

824
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:44,440
That's not true.

825
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:51,250
This document was found
by the Chinese prosecution team

826
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,650
in the archives of
the Japanese Army lnternal Affairs Office.

827
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,230
lt is ajournal kept
by Saionji and Harada.

828
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,600
lt records in detail

829
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:05,700
how the emperor severely

830
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:09,240
reprimanded ltagaki for
both these incidents.

831
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:13,370
And you have the nerve to deny
this ever happened?

832
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:20,350
Your Honors, l now submit
this evidence to the court.

833
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:23,250
please examine it and have it recorded.

834
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:31,180
Near the end of your term
as minister of the army,

835
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:35,790
you sent an emissary to China to meet
with two individuals...

836
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,130
the first premier of the Republic of China,

837
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,740
Tang Shaoyi,

838
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:44,940
and the former head
of the Northern Warlords, Wu Peifu

839
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:46,230
ls that correct?

840
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:49,640
Yes

841
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:54,220
Your emissary's purpose was to
entice them to participate

842
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:58,120
in a puppet organization you were
trying to set up. ls that right?

843
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:01,380
l don't know.

844
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:06,590
Well, do you at least
remember whom you sent?

845
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,970
Was that person none other than the one

846
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:13,160
who usurped the position
of mayor of Shenyang,

847
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,830
installed the puppet emperor Pu Yi,

848
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,900
fraternized with
the Japanese Kuandong Army,

849
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:21,910
plotted to bring self-rule to North China,

850
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:25,580
instigated the independence movement
in lnner Mongolia,

851
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:33,220
incited traitors everywhere to set up puppet
governments and traitorous organizations

852
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,850
never hesitated to do evil,

853
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:40,690
and now sits in the defendants' table,
namely Kenji Dohihara?

854
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:52,740
ls that him?

855
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,580
Answer me.

856
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:01,480
This is the most brilliant victory of
china's prosecution team

857
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:04,150
During the 10 days heckle with itagaki

858
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,420
Nizheng'ao rebuted
and required those things

859
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,250
He mentioned in the refution.

860
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,620
Finally, by the method
that approaching the topic indirectly,

861
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,390
He beat the Doihara who not say a word.

862
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:20,540
The war which was launched
and enlarged by Hidekitogyo

863
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,130
Brought the Asia a very severe disaster,

864
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:26,140
Also, brought Japan
a far-reaching secret anguish.

865
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:27,970
This secret anguish,

866
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:31,410
Pervaded several decades
after the war finished,

867
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,320
Makes the young of that age full of

868
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,450
Being at sea, despair and even crazy,

869
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,590
The pain of lose destroy
many people's spirit

870
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,160
At the very beginning,
the holy war to the Asia Paciffic,

871
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:46,800
And the worship to Hidekitogyo

872
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:49,990
To where should Japan go?

873
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:53,400
During the time that the young of
Japan thinking of the question,

874
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,830
Also worry about their
own's destiny and future.

875
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,800
War is just like a beast, who licked up

876
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,500
life, honor and country,

877
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,910
As well as blood and ideal.

878
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,790
Thank you.

879
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,890
Japanese people are all good people,

880
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,270
But why they all had
blind faith to the emperor?

881
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:40,580
So why the Chinese people
had blind faith to the Huangdi?

882
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:42,340
But why the emperor had to start a war?

883
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,740
So why Chengjisihan had to
crusage towards to the west?

884
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,250
Why your Tang Empery start war
in Chinese western areas,

885
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:50,140
And fight broad to Korea?

886
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,050
Emperors all want to start wars.

887
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,260
So we must send revolutions.

888
01:09:58,830 --> 01:09:59,920
Revolution?

889
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:32,820
Miss Chiba

890
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:36,320
What happened?

891
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:38,690
What happened?

892
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,090
Miss Chiba

893
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,190
Help!

894
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,530
Hurry! Help!

895
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,530
This became a unsettled case in the end,

896
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:50,760
The killer was not found.

897
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,410
From that day,

898
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:55,700
xiaonan and l had never went there.
any more.

899
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:58,700
The trial to Hideki Tojyo

900
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,680
Would be another fierce fight.

901
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:03,320
At that time, different public voices
came up all over the world.

902
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,920
There was request ofjudging the emperor again.

903
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:09,020
lt was a controversial issue in judges's meetings.

904
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:11,890
But after the secret discussion
between MacArthur and the emperor,

905
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,550
The issue was left unsettled.

906
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,030
Later on, Sir William showed his standpoint

907
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,660
of not charging the emperor and the imperial family.

908
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,000
Brother, l wanner go to eat noodle.

909
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:23,760
Welcome.

910
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:25,160
This way please.

911
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:29,130
YingZi, go and serve the customers.

912
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,100
Welcome.

913
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:44,020
Give me a bowl of noodle
and a bunch of fish.

914
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,450
Sakurako, go to help your father,

915
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,990
Little child, never mind please.

916
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,270
What happiness.

917
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:21,850
Dong Tiao government called 100 million
citizens to go into battle.

918
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,320
The temporary council passed 3800 million Yen

919
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,090
according to the request of
Prime Misinter Dong Tiao.

920
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,490
Don't change the channel.

921
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:30,590
Temporary budget for supplement of military expense

922
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:29,020
firstly l announce here,
delegating my party

923
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:33,020
Hideki Tojyo

924
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:36,490
My party - Hideki Tojyo

925
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:40,120
he except be evidence by himself,

926
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,430
He will not require any
other attestor on the court.

927
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,600
ln addition,
he will not submit any evidence.

928
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:49,770
over

929
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,820
Next, my party will readout his affidavit.

930
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:03,690
finally, maybe this is the last opportunity

931
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,020
on the court permit.

932
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:10,030
l would like to repeat here.

933
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,430
Japanese empire's national policy

934
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,060
The policy was pursued by the officer

935
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,900
who occupy the position legally
at that year.

936
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,910
Not aggression and not exploitation

937
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:29,950
We just pursued according to constitution

938
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:32,250
and law regulation.

939
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:38,250
But still met the rigorous reality.

940
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:42,490
We took the national fate to be ante,
but we lost

941
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:49,430
l insisted on that this was
a war of self-defence.

942
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:53,740
Not a war of disobeying

943
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:58,040
the lnternational Law.

944
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,440
About the responsibility
of the war's failure

945
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:05,250
This is my fault.

946
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:11,750
lt means that l'll take on all
of the responsibility.

947
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:16,460
Hideki toujyou.

948
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:24,810
19th, Dec, Syouwa 22 year, Tokyo.

949
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:30,400
Now, according to your reasoning,

950
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:34,050
on the one hand you carried out
peaceful negotiations

951
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,980
between Japan and China,

952
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:40,280
but on the other you occupied China

953
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:42,650
with a powerful military force.

954
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,960
Aren't those two contradictory?

955
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:47,190
They didn't contradictory any more.

956
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,630
Did you ever contemplate
that the invasion of Manchuria

957
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:54,740
might turn the Chinese public against Japan?

958
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:59,670
Chinese public antipathy against Japan
was existing long before.

959
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:09,950
But Japan have never aggressed China.

960
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:17,760
Silence!

961
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:22,890
How many people did
the Japanese Army kill?

962
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,970
l don't know.

963
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:27,030
This document

964
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,200
was published by the
Japanese lmperial General Headquarters

965
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:40,080
lt reports that between the period
July 1937 and June 1941,

966
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:48,620
the Japanese Army killed two million
and fifteen thousand Chinese people...

967
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:59,260
lsn't it logical that must slaughtering
two million Chinese lives

968
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:05,160
could rouse the fury of the Chinese people?

969
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:11,540
Please answer the question.

970
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:15,440
l also think it was a misfortune.

971
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:20,780
Many of those you butchered
were innocent civilians.

972
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:24,920
Why was the treatment
to these non-involved

973
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:27,290
innocent civilians so atrocious?

974
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:32,200
What is called there is no relation
between people and war

975
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,700
China is same as we Japan.

976
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,200
As the captain of China regime,

977
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:38,640
direct people to

978
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:42,070
oppugn Japan and insult Japan.

979
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,210
so draw on killing.

980
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,040
this is the wrong of China regime.

981
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:52,310
no relation to us.

982
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:04,930
So l insist donot withdraw from China.

983
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,300
Further more keep extending the war.
ls it right?

984
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:13,470
l don't like answer yes or no.

985
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:20,380
This is a courtroom. Your wants are
irrelevant and an answer is mandatory.

986
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:23,220
So, yes or no

987
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:25,250
Object

988
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:31,350
The procurator didn't have
right to ask like that.

989
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,620
Objection overruled!

990
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,200
The witness must answer
the prosecutor's question

991
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:37,920
with yes or no.

992
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:42,500
Answer me! Yes or no?

993
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:51,350
No

994
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:56,450
No? Did Japan evacuate troops from China

995
01:20:56,650 --> 01:21:01,250
after you received instructions to
form a cabinet in October 1941?

996
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:04,290
No, but that was

997
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:05,660
You already answered my question.

998
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:07,420
l don't need an explanation.

999
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,500
ln your statement,

1000
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:19,670
you said that Japan's decision to go to
war with the United States,

1001
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,570
Britain and Holland

1002
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:25,210
which was the direct result for those countries

1003
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,280
freezing Japan assets on July 26, 1941, correct?

1004
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:30,580
Yes

1005
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:32,550
You already told the court that

1006
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:36,160
the emperor loves peace, didn't you

1007
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,320
Yes

1008
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:42,720
Furthermore, no Japanese
official or commoner

1009
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:49,340
would dare to disobey the emperor's orders,
is that correct?

1010
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:53,570
What l said was a national sensibility,

1011
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:56,500
That was different from
the Emperor's responsibility.

1012
01:21:56,810 --> 01:22:03,480
But as a matter of fact,
did you not initiate hostilities

1013
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:06,450
against the United States,
Britain and the Netherland?

1014
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:10,020
That was decision of our council.

1015
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:14,730
lf the emperor opposed the war,

1016
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,920
would it still have happened?

1017
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,070
l have already said lots of times that
the Emperor didn't have any responsibility,

1018
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,570
Japan had no choice but initiate the war.

1019
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:26,500
Do you think initiating
hostilities is morally

1020
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,700
and legally acceptable?

1021
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,870
l think it is acceptable,

1022
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:32,980
whenever past now and future,

1023
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:35,310
l still think it is acceptable.

1024
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:41,280
So if you and your colleagues
were acquitted,

1025
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:45,820
You would go out
and do it all over again?

1026
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:48,900
You would continue to allow
Japan to launch invasions

1027
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:51,260
and start wars?

1028
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,770
Yes

1029
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:05,800
Dear honours,

1030
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:12,210
the procecution'd like to announce that we've
completed our cross examination of Hideki Tojyo

1031
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:24,090
YingZi

1032
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,160
All be sitted.

1033
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:04,540
The 817th session of lnternational
Military Tribunal for the Far East

1034
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,170
is now in session.

1035
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:11,570
Next, the prosecution
will make its closing argument.

1036
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:18,550
Ladies and gentlemen,

1037
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,720
Honorable judges,

1038
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:22,980
and members of the court...

1039
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:26,220
all of the accused,

1040
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:31,920
joined in a formulation
and execution of a plan

1041
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:38,030
a conspiracy whose publish
was to establish Japan's

1042
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:40,400
military, political,

1043
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:44,010
and economic domination over the countries

1044
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:46,910
within the Pacific and lndian Oceans!

1045
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,280
ln order to achieve this goal,

1046
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:51,180
Japan alone

1047
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:54,350
or working with liked minds,

1048
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:57,890
embarked on a war

1049
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:04,160
of aggression to subjugate all
who stood in its way.

1050
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:07,090
My prosecution team and l

1051
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,130
have produced more than enough evidence

1052
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:13,900
to prove the participation of the accused

1053
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:16,000
in the above summarized criminal actions.

1054
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:19,340
Throughout the history of civilization,

1055
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:26,880
no one has ever seen
such a peak of cruelty

1056
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,650
and barbarity.

1057
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:33,020
Countless people died horrendous,

1058
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:40,690
unthinkable deaths to feed Japan's
insatiable appetite for domination.

1059
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:42,540
By their actions,

1060
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:46,800
they have challenged human civilization,

1061
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,430
challenged peace,

1062
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:52,680
and challenged the whole world!

1063
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:59,210
Their mutual delict intent.

1064
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:06,520
in order to be sure the reign
position of Japanese king.

1065
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:11,360
No worth guilt than start

1066
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:17,240
the aggression battle.

1067
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:20,500
the safe of all world people

1068
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,600
be threatened by this intrigue.

1069
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:26,240
be wrecked by the war

1070
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:29,140
only result of the intrigue.

1071
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:34,450
is taking world people to
undergo dead and pain

1072
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,220
Therefore, l, Joseph Keenan,

1073
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:42,250
on behalf of my colleagues
on the Allied prosecution team,

1074
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:48,760
solemnly request the honorable judges of
the lnternational Military Tribunal

1075
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:50,200

1076
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:54,070
to severely punish those responsible

1077
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:58,040
for this horrible war of aggression,

1078
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:00,450
in the honor ofjustice

1079
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:03,040
in the spirit of compassion,

1080
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:06,780
and in the honor of humanity.

1081
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:20,530
The presentation of the cases

1082
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:25,040
before the lnternational Military Tribunal
for the Far East is now concluded.

1083
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:29,640
The verdict will be announced after
the judges' final deliberations.

1084
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:32,970
Until that time, the court is in recess.

1085
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:55,570
Yuiqi, what are you doing

1086
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:58,370
Revenge, for my brother

1087
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:06,080
For all persons who died in the war

1088
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:13,550
lt was me who killed your brother

1089
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:27,900
Why? why you killed him

1090
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:39,170
Have you seen a child kill persons?

1091
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:48,090
Yuiqi, what a chastity boy

1092
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:54,890
But he became a devil in the war

1093
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:59,730
l had to killed him

1094
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,120
Japanese devil!

1095
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:31,330
Brother

1096
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:34,630

l can accept you not to love me

1099
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:58,690
But

1100
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:05,400
l can't accept you

1101
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:11,200

1102
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:22,270
l love you.

1103
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:52,640
Yousuko!

1104
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:54,710
Yousuko!

1105
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:58,310
Are you alright?

1106
01:30:58,490 --> 01:30:59,750

1109
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:23,540
Yousuko, Please say something to me

1110
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:39,220
Please say something to me

1111
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:45,360
Far east international military tribunal

1112
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:47,630
entered the final stage.

1113
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:51,030
judgers from 11 countries have
huge difference for the judgement.

1114
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:53,330
and appeared opposed emotions.

1115
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:56,410
especially for the Hidekitojyo
and other 24 criminals.

1116
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:58,710
on the question ifjudge them gallows

1117
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,780
Occurred feud.

1118
01:32:19,130 --> 01:32:20,930
is it the problem that how to condemn?

1119
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:26,440
a reporter of English Times News,

1120
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:29,140
whose forecast is very surprise

1121
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:33,870
on the problem whether use death penalty

1122
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:40,220
He said, there are 2 splits
among eleven countries.

1123
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:44,760
further more it is the most number
which disagree with dead penalty...

1124
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:52,390
do not ask me any more.
l can say nothing to you.

1125
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:58,800
people cannot identify the devilishness

1126
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:04,110
of the war and crime,
until suffer the harm

1127
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:09,080
l have never regret, but today...

1128
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,280
l regretted.

1129
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:15,450
chose to come to Japan.

1130
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:21,590
Thinking of xiangyu's tragedy,
l want to commit suicide.

1131
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:23,320
Mei,

1132
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:26,090
you want to learn xiangYu?
And do you want to die?

1133
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:30,870
if you died, then the judger
could stand by you.

1134
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:34,800
could punish the war criminal

1135
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:37,800
you could jump down from the window,

1136
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:39,500
l do not hold you.

1137
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,450
Do you think you can help by doing so?

1138
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:45,880
Bullshit.

1139
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,250
l think you are probably a coward.

1140
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:57,100
do you think you can move god,
depend upon your emotion?

1141
01:33:58,170 --> 01:34:00,330
do you think the judgers
will stand by you,

1142
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,600
depend upon your temper
and your complaint?

1143
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:08,840
action, show me your action!

1144
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:13,310
there is a logion in Hunan

1145
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:17,340
as long as you can not fight me died,
l will stand up!

1146
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:25,190
l will stand up.

1147
01:34:56,830 --> 01:34:58,690
lf no one has anything new to add,

1148
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,450
we can begin voting...

1149
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:08,000
Alright, since no one has anything
left to contribute,

1150
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:09,390
let's get started.

1151
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:12,540
Sir William, would l say a few
more things before we start voting?

1152
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:13,540
Of course

1153
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:14,640
Thank you

1154
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,980
Please give me a glass of water

1155
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:28,280
We all agree that the criminals

1156
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:29,750
are guilty.

1157
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:31,960
But we cannot agree

1158
01:35:32,130 --> 01:35:34,120
if they should be hanged for what they did.

1159
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:37,000
A lot of innocent people died for the war.

1160
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:38,760
They can only rest in peace

1161
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:42,170
when these criminals are
punished by the death penalty.

1162
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:45,600
Mr. Bernard

1163
01:35:46,810 --> 01:35:50,240
your objection to the death penalty is
because you believe a civilized country

1164
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:52,810
should have abolished the death penalty.
Am l right?

1165
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:54,350
absolutely right

1166
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:57,310
ln general, l agree with you

1167
01:35:57,790 --> 01:35:59,220
but in this case, l have my doubts...

1168
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:01,980
Mei, l'd be happy to discuss it

1169
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:05,460
According to your logic,
civilization should be respected

1170
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:09,220
but what about life?
Shouldn't life be respected?

1171
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:11,730
l don't think l need to answer
that question

1172
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:15,130
You should already know
the answer perfectly well

1173
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:19,340
l'm sure you wouldn't deny the preciousness
of life because everyone only lives once

1174
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,340
Because everyone has one life.

1175
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:28,120
Suppose this cup represents humanity
and the water representscivilization

1176
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:34,520
Please excuse my crudeness

1177
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:39,290
Civilization is created by human being

1178
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:43,430
lf people were ruthlessly murdered,
how can we talk about civilization

1179
01:36:46,170 --> 01:36:47,260
Mr. Bernard

1180
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:49,360
Mei, pls. Seat down.

1181
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,600
Mei, you want to discuss Buddhism with me

1182
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:57,210
l don't know a lot about Buddhism

1183
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:59,340
but l have a great
deal of respect for it...

1184
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:02,080
when l was a child,
l learned from my parents

1185
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,340
l've known that Buddhism
encourages people to do good

1186
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,180
and avoid doing evil. Correct?

1187
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:08,150
That's a fundamental idea

1188
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:12,990
Besides the teachings to promoting goodness,
isn't there also punishment of the evil

1189
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:17,860
Yes. But Buddhism says that punishment
is carried out the next life.

1190
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:19,000
You mean

1191
01:37:19,170 --> 01:37:23,600
if someone does evil in this lifetime,
he'll pay for it in the next. Right?

1192
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:24,740
That's right

1193
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,740
But who will prevent
the crime this lifetime?

1194
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,740
Could Buddha prevent Japan
not to start wars again?

1195
01:37:32,450 --> 01:37:35,210
Dose Hideki Tojyo believe Buddha?

1196
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,490
Buddha will help him believe

1197
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:39,880
Buddha will love him

1198
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:43,020
and forgive him for everything he's done.

1199
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:46,720
ln the end, Buddha will embrace everyone

1200
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:48,730
That's how his power works

1201
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:55,940
we are side with Buddha hoping that
in the future, there are no war anymore.

1202
01:37:58,010 --> 01:37:59,200
No crime or evil.

1203
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:02,000
But expectation in spirit can affect
what's happen in realism.

1204
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:04,510
Those unbearable ugliness
and trample on humanity

1205
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,510
l don't have any doubts
about the power of Buddha,

1206
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:09,850
But l doubt that if the people

1207
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:12,210
can reach light
under the direction of Buddha.

1208
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:15,880
Buddha says believe makes the dream come true,

1209
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:20,320
But what if these criminals
do not believe in Buddha at all?

1210
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:24,630
l agree to the ancient Greeks' proverb

1211
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:29,400
What god has will belong to him at last.

1212
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:31,500
Mr. Pal

1213
01:38:32,410 --> 01:38:33,810
Why we come to here,

1214
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:41,750
the judges from 11 countries,
have come to Japan, for what?

1215
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:44,580
so

1216
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:47,150
we msut punish the criminals
according to law.

1217
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,360
Mei, don't try to persuade me anymore

1218
01:38:58,630 --> 01:39:01,190
l still think my viewpoint is correct.

1219
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:04,870
Mr. Pal, l won't try to
persuade you any further

1220
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:08,700
The ancient Greeks had a proverb

1221
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:12,310
Fate sees the world more
properly than we do

1222
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:20,580
l can see that l'm next.

1223
01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:21,820
Please...

1224
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:25,450
Lao Wei, my dearjudger

1225
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:29,030
All of you here are legal experts
from all over the world

1226
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:33,030
l want to ask you

1227
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:35,130
what is law

1228
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,900
and what is the function of it

1229
01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:42,670
Throughout the 817th long tribunal
between the two years,

1230
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,870
We finally confirm that they are guilty

1231
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:52,840
But now we were talking about
the civilization and the religion

1232
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:57,720
Gentlemen,

1233
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:01,360
This is not classroom of collage,

1234
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:04,290
This is not temper

1235
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,000
This is court!

1236
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:12,630
What we need to talk about
is how to punish the criminals

1237
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:20,340
l think the role of religion
is to tell people

1238
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,570
what can be done,
to tell people to do good and to forgive.

1239
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:24,780
On the other hand,

1240
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:29,310
Law prescribes what cannot be done.

1241
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:31,550
Otherwise, you will be punished by law.

1242
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:36,060
You will have to go to the guillotine
and the scaffold.

1243
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:37,830
This is law

1244
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:40,960
This is why l insist on imposing

1245
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:42,970
the death penalty on the war criminals

1246
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,460
Besides robbing the resource
of other countries

1247
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:48,140
and expanding his territory

1248
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:51,840
Japan also killed thousands
of innocent people

1249
01:40:53,450 --> 01:40:58,250
Japanese army's plundering raping
backfiring and killing,

1250
01:40:58,490 --> 01:41:01,750
They had killed numerous innocent people-
the Chinese, the Koreans, the Filipinos,

1251
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,920
the Singaporeans,
the Americans, the Englishmen...

1252
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:12,030
These crimes are not enough
to bring them to justice

1253
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,430
lf neither Japan

1254
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:24,280
nor the war criminals receive
the severest punishment

1255
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:26,940
who can assure that they will

1256
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,840
never wage war again?

1257
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:33,480
Who can assure that Japan
will never invade other countries?

1258
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:37,250
Who can assure that
the Japanese militaristic spirit

1259
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:39,050
will never revive?

1260
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:44,490
anyone of you here is able to
make an assurance like this

1261
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:55,640
What l wanted to say,
what l should've said, it's done

1262
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:01,540
We can vote now

1263
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:05,050
for all those who died in the war...

1264
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:09,250
for closing eyes in death

1265
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:12,250
pls. Think it over.

1266
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:16,630
They are watching us, watching
the pens we hold in our hands...

1267
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:10,800
No for the death penalty

1268
01:44:19,390 --> 01:44:20,510
No

1269
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:31,430
Yes for the death penalty

1270
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:40,970
No

1271
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,040
No

1272
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:00,550
Yes

1273
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:11,630
No

1274
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:21,410
Yes

1275
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:31,950
Yes

1276
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,060
Yes

1277
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:48,030
Gentleman

1278
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,170
as you see this 5 to 5

1279
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:54,110
This is the last ballot...

1280
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:58,020
This one last ballot
will decide everything

1281
01:46:17,670 --> 01:46:18,700
Yes

1282
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,750
l will now read the verdict...

1283
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:09,850
the court believes

1284
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:16,500
that there is no need to consider whether
or not the accused are guilty of

1285
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:22,190
the conspiracy to violate treaties
and accords Japan had

1286
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,630
with other countries

1287
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:34,640
because charge of executing a plot along with
other countries to wage an aggressive war

1288
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:38,080
is already the gravest
crime one can commit.

1289
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:44,950
The court finds all the Japanese
defendants guilty as charged!

1290
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:53,200
international military tribunal concluded,

1291
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:57,170
ln the end, seven criminals
were punished to death.

1292
01:47:58,470 --> 01:48:00,670
until now, l can't call to mind,

1293
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:02,840
on this morning,

1294
01:48:03,010 --> 01:48:05,170
if the judges who agreed death sentence

1295
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:06,970
were not reach six,

1296
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,440
what will happen to me

1297
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:09,950
what will happen to all the Chinese people

1298
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:12,090
what will happen to the whole world

1299
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:13,680
otherwise,

1300
01:48:13,850 --> 01:48:16,150
all the judges had pledged
in the beginning

1301
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:18,330
we would never disclose that

1302
01:48:18,490 --> 01:48:20,320
