00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:12,036
NICKY: When we got local merch...

154
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:15,100
we'd usually send it to Palm Springs,
or Arizona, L.A.

155
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:18,213
I had a couple of sand niggers out there.
You know, Arabs.

156
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:20,841
Are you gonna have a meeting
or buy some diamonds?

157
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,044
I know his language. I'm talking with him.

158
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,019
$40,000, you buy the whole package.

159
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,215
$20,000. That's my final offer.

160
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,283
He suddenly talks English.
Let's talk turkey. $25,000.

161
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,631
NICKY: I actually turned my bedroom into
a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.

162
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:42,863
I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush
in case we got raided by the cops...

163
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,804
or if my crew got cute.

164
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:47,742
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.

165
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:50,803
She fell asleep on the couch
watching TV every night.

166
00:08:50,914 --> 00:08:54,611
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.

167
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:57,847
Actually, I couldn't,
because I wasn't supposed to be doing it.

168
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:00,719
The bosses were making
so much money with the casinos...

169
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,816
that they didn't want anybody
making any waves.

170
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:07,319
You've all given your crew a piece of that?

171
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,057
I took care of everybody.

172
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:14,035
NICKY: That's why there was no real
organized street stuff in Vegas before I came.

173
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,799
But how much cash could I bury
in my closet, right?

174
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:18,966
You have to understand,
and I'm sure you do...

175
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,771
that in a venture of this kind...

176
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:23,540
you must be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

177
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:28,116
NICKY: I put some money in legitimate
deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.

178
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:31,143
-You will try to push it through, won't you?
-Yes.

179
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:33,621
You got to understand,
I'm giving you $50,000 cash.

180
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,490
NICKY: Then I put more money
in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.

181
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:39,461
DOMINICK: Is that the last one?
COOK: Yeah.

182
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:42,327
NICKY: I had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it.

183
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:44,864
Fuckers.

184
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,239
DOMINICK: Here you go, guys.

185
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:53,868
-Thanks a lot.
-Enjoy it. Have a good time.

186
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:55,774
-Choke on it, motherfucker.
-Hi, Dom.

187
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,142
How you doing?

188
00:09:57,213 --> 00:10:01,047
SAM: Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

189
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:03,845
And over the years,
he always made money with them.

190
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,356
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.

191
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:11,554
He had politicians, showgirls
and movie stars hanging out all over.

192
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:14,260
That show at The Flamingo
gets better and better.

193
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:17,926
By the way, Sammy said whenever
you have a minute, give him a call.

194
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:20,799
-Made you a messenger, too?
-I'll do anything for a buck.

195
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,067
-He does it to everybody. Enjoy your dinner.
-Thanks.

196
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:27,940
SAM: I got to tell you, the thing Nicky
liked most was the showgirls.

197
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,171
To them, Nicky was the movie star.

198
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:33,079
-You walk past me?
-This is Shelly.

199
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:35,174
-Hi, Shelly. How are you?
-Hi.

200
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:36,775
This is Stacy.

201
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,080
-This is Nick. Wanna have dinner? Come on.
-All right.

202
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,852
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

203
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:46,327
NICKY: Come on, I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.

204
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:49,728
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

205
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,633
You can always tell a great kitchen
like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

206
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:56,695
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

207
00:10:56,773 --> 00:11:00,265
Out here, they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

208
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:04,142
Now, pink veal you can pound for two days.

209
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,614
NICKY: It'll never ever get tender.
You know what I mean?

210
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:10,810
AL: I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

211
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:14,118
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.

212
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,316
-That's what I did.
-Yeah?

213
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:18,457
You call yourself a man?

214
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:22,930
You know you're a lying lowlife,
motherfucking gambling degenerate prick?

215
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,695
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.

216
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,999
I gave you money to pay the fucking rent...

217
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:30,096
and buy groceries, put the heat on.

218
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:33,665
You know your wife called Frankie
and told him the fucking heat's off?

219
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:36,211
You didn't gamble that money?
Can you tell me that?

220
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,871
-No, you didn't?
-I didn't.

221
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,474
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck out of me.

222
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:44,917
You wanna make a fool out of me?
You didn't gamble?

223
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:49,687
Tell me you gambled the money and
I'll give you the money to put the heat on!

224
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,420
Did you gamble?

225
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:57,792
Fucking degenerate, you.

226
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:00,133
Fucking kids at home.

227
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,839
Here. Get the fuck out of here.

228
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:08,071
AL: Thanks, Nick.
NICKY: Yeah, thanks.

229
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,375
If I find out you fucked up,
I'll leave you where I find you.

230
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:14,510
NICKY: How many of these you gonna eat?
NICKY JR.: Two.

231
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:18,210
SAM: At around 6:30 a.m.,
when he finished his day...

232
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,414
no matter where he was
or what he was doing...

233
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,857
he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

234
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,058
NICKY: I know you like this.

235
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:29,530
NICKY: A little butter, right?
Not a lot. You know why, right?

236
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,968
NICKY: Why?
NICKY JR.: 'Cause it clogs up your heart.

237
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:35,129
What a smart kid you are.

238
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,233
NICKY: Okay, eat.

239
00:12:37,307 --> 00:12:40,276
NICKY: Every couple of weeks,
I sent Marino back to the bosses...

240
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:44,336
BACK HOME
with a piece of what I made.
Not a big piece, but what did they know?

241
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:48,508
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't
know anybody who can see that far.

242
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:50,485
Their drop was a truck stop garage...

243
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:54,148
where Remo and the guys
used to hang out and count their millions.

244
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:57,822
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck.
They worked it out.

245
00:12:57,894 --> 00:12:59,828
Nicky sends his warmest regards.

246
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:01,830
NICKY: I knew how to keep
the bosses happy.

247
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:05,334
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do,
you know, to send a message...

248
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:08,859
I would carry things out to a "T."

249
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:13,302
Like the time Tony Dogs, who was supposed
to be the new maniac tough guy in town...

250
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,537
shot up one of Remo's bars.

251
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,882
Here's a fucking guy
who kills two of Remo's guys...

252
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:27,218
and a poor fucking waitress
who was just working on her night off.

253
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:33,124
This guy's just begging
to be made an example of.

254
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:36,764
I want the names of all the other people
he had with him.

255
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:40,529
I don't care what you have to do to them
to get them. You understand?

256
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:42,434
FRANK: I'll take care of it.

257
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:46,037
NICKY: To be truthful with you,
I had to admire this fucking guy.

258
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:48,907
He was one of the toughest
Irishmen I ever met.

259
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:51,310
This son of a bitch was tough.

260
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,778
For two days and two nights,
we beat the shit out of him.

261
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:57,011
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.

262
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,078
NICKY: Hope he gives me a name,
or I'll give him yours, Frank.

263
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,248
FRANK: Thanks a lot.

264
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:02,416
NICKY: But he never talked.

265
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:04,483
NICKY: I know you would've ratted by now.

266
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:07,826
NICKY: In the end,
I had to put his fucking head in a vice.

267
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:09,825
NICKY: Can you hear me?

268
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,000
Listen to me. I got your head in a vice.

269
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:17,232
I'll squash your head like a grapefruit
if you don't give me a name.

270
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:19,707
NICKY: Don't make me do this.
Please, come on.

271
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,937
Don't make me be a bad guy.

272
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:24,977
Fuck you.

273
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:28,209
Motherfucker. You believe this?
Two fucking days and nights.

274
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,276
Fuck me? You motherfucker!

275
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:34,084
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're telling me?

276
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:35,852
You motherfucker!

277
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,323
Oh, God. Give me the fucking name!

278
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,795
Charlie M.

279
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,464
-Charlie M.
-Charlie M?

280
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:47,463
You make me pop your eye out your head...

281
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:49,869
to protect that piece of shit?

282
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,440
You dumb motherfucker!

283
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:54,271
Kill me, you fuck!

284
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:56,539
You motherfucker!

285
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:59,311
Frankie, do him a fucking favor.

286
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:02,116
SAM: Word got around that finally...

287
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,676
there was a real gangster in town.

288
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:07,816
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.

289
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:09,256
NICKY: Charlie M.

290
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,795
[Coins clinking]

291
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:17,196
SAM: Four reels, sevens across.
Three $15,000 jackpots.

292
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,234
You have any idea what the odds are?

293
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:21,600
It's gotta be in the millions. Maybe more.

294
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,933
Three jackpots in 20 minutes?

295
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,770
Why didn't you pull the machines?
Why didn't you call me?

296
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,572
It happened quick. Three guys won.
I didn't have a chance.

297
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:30,545
You didn't see the scam?

298
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:32,478
There's no way to determine that.

299
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,607
Yes, there is. An infallible way. They won!

300
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,380
It's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.

You're insulting my intelligence.

Somebody had to get into those machines
and set the reels.

The probability on one machine
is a million and a half to one.

-I'll regret it if I keep you.

-If you didn't know about the scam...

If you did, you were in on it.

Either way, you're out. Go on.

The guy is history as far as I'm concerned.

You can't fire him.
His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.

319
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,632
Everyone out here with cowboy boots
is a commissioner or related to one.

320
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,142
I'm sick of this.

321
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,405
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge.

322
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,880
His brother-in-law runs
the County Commission.

323

There's gotta be a way to work him back in.

24 hours a day.

all the details all the time.

335
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:19,919
SAM: From now on, I want you to put an
equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.

336
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:23,117
An equal amount of blueberries
in each muffin.

337
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,890
Do you know how long that will take?

338
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:29,796
I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.

-Got her?

344

I need a lot. I need more than usual.

Why don't you take it out of your account?

346
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,519
I would, it's just that...

347
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,628
I need more than that. I need $25,000.

-For yourself?
-Yeah.

What's the difference? I just need it.

352

I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money.
It's not a box of popcorn.

Why can't you tell me what it's for?

Now I want you to tell me.

359
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:46,039
My wife comes to me and asks me
for $25,000. Do you want a coat?

00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:48,543
GINGER: No.
SAM: If you want a coat, you got it.

361
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:51,307
It's not the money.
It's just, why do you want it?

362
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,143
Am I not entitled to ask that?

363
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,811
I've been independent all my life.
I never had to ask anybody for anything.

364
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,286
Now you're making me beg you for this.

-Okay? And you're embarrassing me.

I'm not out to make you feel bad.
I want to just be able to trust you.

he's jealous and worries.

Maybe you didn't know it...

in this town.

He's got lots of friends. His family

maybe he did not deserve to be fired.

and he did nothing about it.

Either he was in on it
or, forgive me, he was too dumb to see it.

Either way, I cannot have
a man like that working here.

606
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:52,679
BOSS: What were you doing?

607
00:33:52,748 --> 00:33:53,874
I was with my cumari.

608
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,974
BOSS: What were you doing
with your cumari?

609
00:33:56,051 --> 00:33:57,211
I gave her a schiaffo.

610
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,879
NICKY: The only trouble was,
Piscano was a disaster.

611
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,082
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.

612
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:05,251
BOSS: What you been doing?
ARTIE: I'm out there more than I'm here.

613
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:07,761
NICKY: Little did anybody know
where this would lead.

614
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:11,390
If they did, they would've
been better off making fucking novenas.

615
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,730
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.

616
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,828
-My expenses weren't paid for the last trip.
-What expenses?

617
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:20,773
I'm laying money out of my own pocket,
and I never get anything back.

618
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:22,571
You gotta go back out there.

619
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,238
From now on,
I'm gonna start keeping records.

620
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,407
What are you gonna do with records,
pay taxes?

621
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,975
I can't keep laying out
my own fucking dough for these trips.

622
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,213
What the hell are we doing over here?

623
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:37,190
You're going to Las Vegas and having
a good time at my expense.

624
00:34:37,259 --> 00:34:39,124
What the fuck? I mean, after all....

625
00:34:39,194 --> 00:34:41,355
SAM: No matter how many
novenas you could make...

626
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,990
nothing was gonna stop
what came up next at the casino.

627
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:47,058
PHILIP: I can't believe you're doing this.
ANNA: We made a deal.

628
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:49,603
SAM: It turned out Phil Green,
"Mr. Integrity"...

629
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,764
had a partner nobody knew about...

630
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,037
and when she showed up
and demanded money from Tangiers...

631
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:57,737
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Because you're wrong.

632
00:34:57,813 --> 00:34:59,212
ANNA: I'm not.
PHILIP: You are.

633
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:00,475
No, I am not wrong.

634
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:02,449
...Green tried to stonewall her.

635
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,985
ANNA: I will see that
you don't get away with this.

636
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:07,021
So, she sued him in court.

637
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:09,716
The court will now hear the matter
of Anna Scott...

638
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:13,056
against Tangiers Corporation
and its President, Philip Green.

639
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:17,224
OBERON: Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
LOGAN: Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.

640
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,391
JUDGE: Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
OBERON: Thank you.

641
00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:23,630
I believe he was fair,
and I'm delighted with the decision.

642
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,400
We got a problem.

643
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,003
It didn't go too well.

644
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:31,670
Green has to open up the books...

645
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:34,146
has to show how he got the financing.

646
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,047
That's not good.

647
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:42,153
NICKY: She was doing pretty good
with her lawsuit.

648
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,590
But before she could start
counting her money...

649
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:47,594
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court.

650
00:35:47,662 --> 00:35:49,323
So they sent me.

651
00:36:05,547 --> 00:36:07,606
REPORTER: Any comment on
the murder of Anna Scott?

652
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:08,979
What are you talking about?

653
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,280
REPORTER: She was found last night
shot in the head.

654
00:36:11,353 --> 00:36:13,446
MAN: Was this just
a real estate partnership?

655
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:15,615
MAN 2: Her lawyer said you were partners.

656
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,456
We were involved
in minor real estate deals many years ago.

657
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:21,722
It was never a partnership.

658
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,097
MAN: Did you ever hear
of the.22 caliber killer?

659
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,135
SAM: Now, Instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky...

660
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:30,228
they started looking at Green, too.

661
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:32,967
And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

662
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:36,306
I had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew...

663
00:36:36,378 --> 00:36:37,811
the casino was on the up-and-up.

664
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:40,439
So how often do you really fill in for him?

665
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:45,718
Green's here about two or three times
a month...

666
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,881
and he's busy
with other real estate deals, and things.

667
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:52,220
So in Green's absence,
then, you're the boss?

668
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:55,787
I serve at the pleasure
of the Chairman of the Board.

669
00:36:56,398 --> 00:37:00,129
My responsibilities are
to run the day-to-day operations.

670
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,865
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?

671
00:37:02,938 --> 00:37:06,806
Well, in a sense, you could say
that I am the boss...

672
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:09,066
when Mr. Green is away.

673
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,113
You could say that.

674
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:16,211
PAT: Have you read this?

675
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:18,182
About Mr. Rothstein.

676
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,853
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker
with mob ties...

677
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:26,291
"says that he is the real boss
of the $100 million Tangiers casino empire."

678
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,592
PAT: Do you believe that?
OFFICIAL: Did he really say that?

679
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,758
Why, of course he really said that.
It's right here.

680
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:36,327
Has that man even filed for his license yet?

681
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:38,869
I don't know. We have to check the files.

682
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,909
Without getting your shorts in a knot,
would you do that?

683
00:37:41,977 --> 00:37:45,879
And check closely, 'cause we may
have to kick a kike's ass out of town.

684
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:48,714
PAT: Thank you.

685
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:53,549
A Gaming Control Board investigation
of Tangiers executive...

686
00:37:53,622 --> 00:37:56,716
Sam Rothstein's application
for a gaming license is underway.

687
00:37:56,791 --> 00:38:01,194
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers casino
operation and is a boyhood friend...

688
00:38:01,296 --> 00:38:04,026
of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro...

689
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:06,999
could lose his ability
to work in the casino....

690
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,059
[Phone rings]

691
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:11,629
Hello?

692
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:16,075
I gotta meet Charlie the Banker
right away at your house, okay?
I gotta meet Clean Face right away.
What about the Chez Paris?

693
00:38:16,144 --> 00:38:18,339
You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.

694
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:19,471
NICKY: No, it's okay.

695
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:23,540
I don't want a meeting at my house.
It's impossible. It's booked up,
and it's very difficult to get in.

696
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:27,179
I'll come in from the golf course side.
See you at six.
It's okay, I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at nine.

697
00:38:27,255 --> 00:38:28,552
All right.

698
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,953
The battle between state gaming
officials and Tangiers casino boss...

699
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:36,429
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.

700
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:40,729
Tonight, a look at Ace Rothstein's
attempt to get state licensing...

701
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:45,101
despite law-enforcement allegations of
Rothstein's organized crime connections.

702
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:49,571
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship
with organized crime figure, Nicky Santoro...

703
00:38:49,678 --> 00:38:52,340
keep Rothstein
from running the Tangiers casino?

704
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:56,441
And can the integrity of state gaming laws
be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?

705
00:38:56,518 --> 00:38:59,385
SAM: Why don't you take it easy
on that stuff?

706
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:02,683
Come on. Let me help you down.

707
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,190
We're talking about some stuff.

708
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,386
NEWSCASTER: At 6:00,
will a boyhood friendship...

709
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:08,861
unseat Rothstein
as the Tangiers casino boss?

710
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,865
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.

711
00:39:13,735 --> 00:39:16,260
Go down. Just go downstairs.

712
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:25,072
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry about that stuff.

713
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:27,614
It's just a political witch hunt.

714
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:36,652
SAM: Do you want something to drink?

715
00:39:36,725 --> 00:39:39,193
-Charlie, you want a refill?
-Yeah, that would be great.

716
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,718
I don't want nothing. Hi, Mr. Clark.
I've been trying to reach you.

717
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,595
-You're tougher to get than the President.
-I've been busy.

718
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:48,329
Yeah? At least you could return
my phone calls, though.

719
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:51,304
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.

720
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:56,410
And I explained to you that you might
have to take some kind of loss.

721
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,103
Yeah.

722
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,116
I think I want my money back.

723
00:40:03,184 --> 00:40:05,914
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?

724
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:10,513
I think you've gotten
the wrong impression about me.

725
00:40:11,259 --> 00:40:13,124
I think, in all fairness...

726
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:16,686
I should explain to you
exactly what it is that I do.

727
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:21,196
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice
and early, take a walk to the bank...

728
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:25,294
and walk in and see,
and if you don't have my money for me...

729
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:28,865
I'll crack your fucking head
wide open in front of everybody.

730
00:40:29,544 --> 00:40:32,672
And just about the time
that I'm coming out of jail...

731
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:35,939
hopefully, you'll be coming
out of your coma.

732
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,279
And guess what? I'll split
your fucking head open again.

733
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:44,455
'Cause I'm fucking stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.

734
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:47,220
That's my business. That's what I do.

735
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:49,729
We know what you do.

736
00:40:49,798 --> 00:40:52,164
You fuck people out of money
and get away with it.

737
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:53,632
You can't talk to me like that.

738
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,998
NICKY: You fat Irish prick!

739
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:58,561
You put my money to sleep.
Get it, or I'll put your brain to sleep.

740
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,608
Never mind Sam. This is personal.

741
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:04,111
I'll be there in the morning.
You can try me, fatso.

742
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:09,342
-You think he got the point?
-What are you doing?

743
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:13,080
He's a square guy, for Christ's sakes.
He's gonna run to the FBI.

744
00:41:13,188 --> 00:41:15,884
That prick's been dodging me
for three weeks.

745
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,992
-You're trying to tell me what to do?
-I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

746
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,757
You're way out of line. Where's your head?

747
00:41:22,864 --> 00:41:25,526
Where's my head?
Where's your fucking balls?

748
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,333
I'm trying to put something big together.
You know what I'm talking about.

749
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,033
If you're acting like this now,
how can I depend on you?

750
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:36,133
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me...

751
00:41:36,211 --> 00:41:38,111
you're gonna have to go my way.

752
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:41,910
You got to understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.

going through the place.

It's all over if I don't get that license.

755
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:51,256
Believe me, if it goes bad for me,
it's gonna go bad for a lot of people.

756
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:52,987
Forget about your fucking license.

757

I plant my own flag out here,
you ain't gonna need a license.

758
00:41:58,066 --> 00:42:01,092
I don't know what it is,
but the more I talk to you...

759
00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:04,296
the more I feel like you just
don't want to go along with me.

760
00:42:04,372 --> 00:42:07,273
-No, I don't want to come along with you.
-All right.

I don't want to be involved
in anything you're talking about, okay?

762
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,269
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.

I want everything quiet. That's it!

764

Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"? That's quiet?

765
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:19,644
It's taken out of context. I had no control.

766

Ronnie and Billy will tell you
exactly what happened.

767

Back home that looks bad.

768

Looks bad? Every time you're on television,
I get mentioned. That looks bad.

-I lost control?

You're fucking walking around
like John Barrymore.

I lost control?

I don't wanna bring this up, but you treat
people with disrespect. Even your own wife.

My wife? What does she have
to do with this?

775
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:54,319
She was upset about a lot of things,
especially that Lester Diamond incident.

776
00:42:55,056 --> 00:42:58,890
You're the shoulder to cry on?
Did you tell her about your role in that?

777

No, that's not the fucking point.

778
00:43:01,396 --> 00:43:04,229
The point is, she's upset,
and you've got a problem.

I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out

You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.

She came to talk to me.
Was I supposed to throw her out?

Stay away from her.
It's none of your business.

A week ago it was. Now it's not.
When you need me, you need me.

Right, the way you need me
to vouch for you as a citizen.

He wanted to take over.

790
00:43:36,598 --> 00:43:41,433
He wanted to go after Gaggi,
the skim, everything and everybody.

791
00:43:41,502 --> 00:43:45,302
He also stopped asking permission
from back home for every little thing.

792

A casino boss and his wife were killed.

A dealer from the Scirocco.
They questioned Nicky.

of their cars. They questioned Nicky.

Nicky's name was in every newspaper.

Nicky was questioned in two dozen
murders, but they always had to let him go.

There were never any witnesses.

NICKY: The bosses were no better.

806
00:44:34,055 --> 00:44:36,182
They complained because things
don't run smooth.

807

In my line of work,
things don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.

a big deal out of it. It's in all the papers.

on himself, but on me, too.

The FBI watched every move he made,
but he just didn't care.

I'm gonna watch them back.

I spent a few bucks. Top dollar.

I got the latest anti-bugging equipment
from the same places that sell to the CIA.

I had all the special police frequency radios,
FBI de-scramblers, night-vision cameras....

basically sunk the whole world.

MA: There are some that are good
and some that are bad.

COUNSELOR: Members
of the Commission...

901
00:50:09,557 --> 00:50:11,491
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.

902
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:14,221
SAM: When the day finally came, I was ready.

903
00:50:14,328 --> 00:50:17,991
I felt so confident that all I had
to do was present my case.

904
00:50:18,065 --> 00:50:22,661
COUNSELOR: We have documents, one of
which is a report by retired FBl agents...

905
00:50:22,737 --> 00:50:25,865
which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein
from any wrongdoing.

906
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,842
-Counselor, before you continue...
-I want to have this marked....

907
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:33,710
...this Commission acts on a motion
denying the Rothstein application.

908
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:36,944
COUNSELOR: Denying?
SENATOR: Do I hear a motion seconded?

909
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,813
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

910
00:50:38,886 --> 00:50:40,649
Do I have a vote on the motion?

911
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:41,847
-Aye!
-Aye!

912
00:50:41,922 --> 00:50:42,946
Aye!

913
00:50:43,157 --> 00:50:45,284
The ayes have it. This hearing is adjourned.

914
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,920
-You have to be kidding.
-Adjourned? What do you mean?

915
00:50:49,196 --> 00:50:53,690
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the FBl reports.

916
00:50:53,868 --> 00:50:58,828
When you were my guest at the Tangiers
Hotel, didn't you promise me a fair hearing?

917
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,635
SENATOR: I was never your guest.
SAM: Never my guest? I never comped you?

918
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:05,042
I don't comp you
at least three times a month?

919
00:51:05,112 --> 00:51:07,376
I'd like to answer that at this time.

920
00:51:07,581 --> 00:51:11,017
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical
to this point. He's lying.

921
00:51:11,085 --> 00:51:15,078
The only time I was at the Tangiers
was a dinner with Barney Greenstein.

922
00:51:15,189 --> 00:51:16,281
Was I at the dinner?

923
00:51:16,357 --> 00:51:17,881
SENATOR: You were wandering around.

924
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:21,052
SAM: Was I at that dinner?
SENATOR: You were wandering.

925
00:51:21,128 --> 00:51:24,188
SENATOR: You were in the building.
SAM: I was in the building?

926
00:51:24,265 --> 00:51:28,201
You know damn well I was there.
You swore I would have a fair hearing.

927
00:51:28,803 --> 00:51:30,930
Did you not?

928
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:36,039
Tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.

929
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,304
SAM: Give me that much at least!
SENATOR: Yes, you were.

930
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,872
Thanks for not calling me a liar,
you son of a bitch.

931

A routine licensing hearing
turned into bedlam yesterday...

932
00:51:47,755 --> 00:51:51,213
when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino
executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...

933
00:51:51,292 --> 00:51:54,284
accused top gaming officials of corruption.

934
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:57,262
...promised me a fair hearing
when you were comped at my hotel?

935
00:51:57,331 --> 00:52:00,892
And you asked for copies of your bill
to put on your expense account.

936
00:52:00,968 --> 00:52:04,028
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming
license denial...

937
00:52:04,105 --> 00:52:05,163
Bullshit!

938
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:06,433
...Rothstein followed several...

939
00:52:06,507 --> 00:52:10,204
stunned commissioners into the hallway
where he continued his harangue...

940
00:52:10,277 --> 00:52:12,905
until his own lawyers and friends
urged him to leave.

941
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,973
You have a past. I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.

You guys think you have
the right to pass judgment!

NEWSREADER: Long suspected
of running Tangiers without a license...

944
00:52:23,023 --> 00:52:27,551
yesterday's hearing was to determine
if someone with Rothstein's history...

945
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:30,654
was qualified to officially hold
a top gaming post.

-I don't know.

948
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:38,470
What's he doing?

949
00:52:38,606 --> 00:52:41,541
He knows all those guys he yelled at
are friends of ours.

950
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:43,975
What's the matter with him,
making all this mess?

951
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:46,376
Maybe he could run things
with another job title.

952
00:52:46,447 --> 00:52:48,938
Won't be the best,
but what are we gonna do?

953
00:52:49,049 --> 00:52:53,383
REMO: However he runs things, it's gotta be
quiet. Let him hide upstairs in the office.

954
00:52:53,454 --> 00:52:55,888
Say he's a janitor. I don't give a shit.

Our first guest this evening...

00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:17,098
is Frankie Avalon.

PAT: Keep an eye on him.
FRANKIE: I've got a large family.

SAM: How many kids do you have?

976
00:54:27,548 --> 00:54:30,483
I'm very proud to say, eight children.

-That's amazing.
-There's nothing to it. It was my pleasure.

SAM: Let's not take County Commissioner
Pat Webb too seriously.

983
00:54:52,906 --> 00:54:56,535
I recently challenged him to a debate
on this program, and he declined.

984
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:01,240
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.

You can ask me anything you want.

ANDY: What the hell is he doing
on television?

987
00:55:07,154 --> 00:55:11,921
He's on all night, screaming about
taking his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.

988
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:15,917
He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?

989
00:55:16,363 --> 00:55:18,228
He's out of his fucking mind.

990
00:55:18,299 --> 00:55:21,962
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.

00:55:22,036 --> 00:55:24,937
Other people have to pay
through the nose. Such is life.

Andy, go see him. Tell him
maybe it's time he should quit.

993
00:55:36,016 --> 00:55:38,746
SAM: First, what they did
was totally unconstitutional.

994
00:55:38,819 --> 00:55:42,516
SAM: We're on the list to be heard before
the U.S. Supreme Court.

995
00:55:42,623 --> 00:55:44,921
These guys don't care
about the Supreme Court.

996
00:55:44,992 --> 00:55:48,018
They want things to quiet down.
They want you to walk away.

997
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:53,055
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious.
Don't you see what's at stake?

998
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:56,168
The old man said maybe
your friend should give in.

999
00:55:56,236 --> 00:55:59,069
When the old man says "maybe,"
that's like a papal bull.

Not only should you quit, you should run.

1001

Every time they mention my name
in the papers, they mention Nicky, too.

-What are you proposing?
-I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.

1008
00:56:20,894 --> 00:56:23,795
Maybe he should get lost for a while.
Would that be so bad?

-They ain't sending Nicky nowhere.
-If he took a break...

1010
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:28,658
it would give everybody time to maneuver.

1011
00:56:28,736 --> 00:56:32,672
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.

SAM: Of course, as soon as Andy got home,
Nicky heard about our talk in the car.

Next morning, bright and early,
I get the call.

to get around anymore.

00:59:11,031 --> 00:59:13,829
-What people?
-Did you think I wouldn't find out?

1047
00:59:13,901 --> 00:59:16,062
I don't even know what you're talking about.

1048
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:21,096
You said I'm bringing heat on you?
I gotta listen to people because of you?

1049
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:24,369
You're ordering me out? You better get
your own fucking army!

1050
00:59:24,444 --> 00:59:26,002
I didn't order you or anybody.

1051
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,105
I told Andy Stone that you had heat,
and that was a problem.

1052
00:59:29,182 --> 00:59:31,309
You want me to get out
of my own fucking town?

1053
00:59:31,385 --> 00:59:34,684
Yeah, let the bullshit blow over
so I can run the casino.

1054
00:59:34,755 --> 00:59:38,020
Anything goes wrong
with the casino, it's my ass, not yours.

1055
00:59:38,091 --> 00:59:43,051
You know that you only have your fucking
casino because I made that possible!

1056
00:59:43,263 --> 00:59:44,855
I'm what counts out here.

1057
00:59:44,932 --> 00:59:49,028
Not your fucking country clubs
or your fucking TV shows.

1058
00:59:49,102 --> 00:59:51,662
And what the fuck
are you doing on TV anyhow?

1059
00:59:51,738 --> 00:59:55,834
I get calls from back home every day.
They think you went batshit!
