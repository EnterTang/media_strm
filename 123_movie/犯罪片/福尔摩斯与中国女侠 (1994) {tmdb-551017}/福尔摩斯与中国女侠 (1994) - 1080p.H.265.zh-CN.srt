你不该那麽做
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   You shouldn't do that.

13
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,960
敲打玻璃
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Tap the glass.

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,620
你怎麽知道我这麽打算的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   How did you know I was going to?

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,980
还请见谅  我儿子很爱蜜蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  You must forgive my son. He loves bees.

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,900
这不是蜜蜂  这是黄蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   It isn't a bee. It's a wasp.

17
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,720
完全不是一回事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Different thing entirely.

18
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,220
那是他吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Was that him?

19
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,940
啊  浪子归巢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Ah, the prodigal returns.

20
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,360
出去  罗杰  你知道不能进这里的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Outside, Roger. You know you're not allowed.

21
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,260
跟养了一匹威尔士小马驹一样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Like having a Welsh pony.

22
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,020
你要上楼去书房吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Will you be going up to your study?

23
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,860
不  先不上去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   No, not as yet.

24
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,340
啊  舒服  又回家了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Ah, yes. Home again.

25
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,600
终于回家了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Home again.

26
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,460
门罗太太
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Mrs. Munro!

27
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,480
我们遭遇了人口减少事件
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   It would appear we've had a decrease in population.

28
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,620
我不在的时候希利先生有来照料蜂房吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Did Mr. Healy not come by to take care of the apiary whilst I was gone?

29
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,480
来了  不过他下次就不能帮忙了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Yes, but he won't be able to do it next time.

30
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,620
- 他说的吗  - 不是  他女儿说的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Did Mr. Healy say that?  - No, his daughter did.

31
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,140
她带他搬走一起住了  她说他太虚弱了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   She's taken him to live with her. Too feeble, she said.

32
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,660
-  他很虚弱吗  - 看著精神头倒是挺好的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Is he too feeble?  - Seemed spry enough.

33
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,560
- 比以前爱聊天了  也许  - 和你吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Chattier, maybe.  - With you?

34
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,080
自言自语
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  With himself.

35
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,460
书房钥匙
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Key to the study.

36
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,920
- 那是午饭吗  - 嗯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Is that lunch?  - Mm.

37
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,040
华生已经结婚了  我还是孤身一人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Watson had married and I was alone.

38
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,500
事实上  就是在那天  他离开了贝克街
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  In fact, it was on the very day he left Baker Street

39
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,820
也是在那天  我的最后一案拉开序幕
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   that the case which was to be my last began to unfold.

40
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,720
大约30年前  一战结束
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   It was almost 30 years ago. The Great War had ended

41
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,040
游客们也来到贝克街观光
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   and the tourists had come back to Baker Street

42
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,920
想看一眼真实的夏洛克·福尔摩斯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   to catch a glimpse of the real Sherlock Holmes.

43
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,200
还好在华生在故事里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Thankfully, in his stories,

44
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,400
用假地址
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Watson had always published a false address

45
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,160
代替了我们真实的住所
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   for our actual quarters.

46
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,960
看来你找到了正确的地址
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  So you found the right address.

47
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,620
- 你为什麽要这麽做呢  - 先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Why did you do it?  - Sir?

48
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,480
闯进我的书房
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Break into my study.

49
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,300
我的书房是至圣之所
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   My study is my sanctum sanctorum.

50
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,520
私人领地
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Private place.

51
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,740
你去日本之前  我看到你在写那个故事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Before you went to Japan, I saw you writing that story.

52
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,080
我不知道你竟然写故事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I didn't know you wrote stories.

53
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,380
噢  华生医生  他是作者
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Oh, Dr. Watson, yes, he was the writer.

54
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,260
所以  我跟妈妈借了钥匙进了你的书房
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Well, so I borrowed Mum's key and went into your study,

55
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,200
它就在那里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  and there it was.

56
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,540
你看了多少了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   And how much did you read?

57
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,420
就到你停下来的那里  那部分很好看
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Just to where you stopped. It was a good part too.

58
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,740
一个男人来到贝克街
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  A man comes to Baker Street.

59
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,280
你说  你是为你妻子而来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You say, "You've come about your wife."

60
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,020
你怎麽看出来的  你有没有做那件事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} How could you tell? Did you do the thing?

61
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,100
做什麽事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   What thing would that be?

62
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,900
手杖上有狗的牙印
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   "The cane shows the marks of a dog's teeth.

63
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,240
木材来自马德拉西南部的一个岛上
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The wood is from an island southwest of Madeira."

64
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,540
这种事情
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} That thing.

65
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,760
你怎麽知道那个男人是为他妻子来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  And how would you tell that a man's visit was about his wife?

66
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,060
他戴了婚戒吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   He wears a wedding ring?

67
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,060
没  线索都在那一页上
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  No. The clues are all on that page.

68
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,620
确切来说  在这句话里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} This sentence, to be exact.

69
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,960
一天  房间里进来一个年轻人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  "One day, into the room came a young man,

70
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,400
穿著一身刚刚熨烫过  却不甚昂贵的衣服
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} in newly-pressed, albeit inexpensive clothes."

71
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,180
衣服刚熨烫过  但他是个年轻的男性
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The clothes are freshly-pressed. He's a young man, though.

72
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,080
衣服不贵
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Not expensive clothes.

73
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,480
所以一定是他妻子给他熨衣服  男人没这个才能
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Then his wife must press them. Men don't have the talent

74
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,160
他也请不起僕人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and he can't afford a servant to do so.

75
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,640
很不错
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Very good.

76
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,740
- 你是这麽知道他是为妻子而来的  - 嗯  并不是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - That's how you knew it was about the wife.  - Well, no.

77
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,520
如果你是个侦探  而一个男人来找你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} When you're a detective and a man comes to visit you...

78
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,300
通常都是为了他的妻子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} it's usually about his wife.

79
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,000
所以你为什麽到这就停了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   So why did you stop where you did?

80
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,680
你从药店那把东西拿来了吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Ah, did you get the things from the chemist?

81
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,740
下订单了  说需要等几天
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   On order. Said it would be a few days.

82
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,240
我们得盯著他们弄好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   We'll hold them to that.

83
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,640
除此之外一切都非常成功是吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Otherwise, triumphant, were you?

84
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,940
成功得和二战胜利日一样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Like V-E Day.

85
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,300
噢  医生来了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Oh. Doctor's here.

86
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,240
- 你在日本感冒了吗  - 像是这样吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Did you catch cold in Japan? - Does it sound it?

87
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,080
我以为你终于了结了什麽事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I thought you might be coming off the tail end of something.

88
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,560
- 体重也轻了  - 嗯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Lost some weight as well. - Hmm.

89
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,800
你找到你要的了吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Did you find what you were looking for,

90
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,840
神秘的椒山岩
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} the mysterious ashy prick?

91
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,300
岩山椒
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Prickly ash.

92
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,180
噢  不好意思 那家伙就是为了这个邀你去日本的  对吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Oh, yes, sorry. That was the reason the fellow invited you to Japan, wasn't it?

93
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,460
挖出一堆东西  走私回家
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Dig up a pile of the stuff, smuggle it home?

94
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,420
它不会影响到你开的药物的作用
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  It can't interfere with anything you've prescribed.

95
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,800
- 但是它也不可能让我生病吧  - 单凭它  不会
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - But surely it can't do me ill.  - In and of itself, no.

96
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,520
- 你是说有副作用  - 有可能
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - You mean there might be side effects?  - Perhaps.

97
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,900
- 比如呢  - 希望
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Such as?  - Hope.

98
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,580
请你去日本的那个人叫什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} What was the name of the fellow who invited you to Japan?

99
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,180
你刚和那个人一起呆了一个星期
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You just spent a week with the man,

100
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,740
书信来往有几个月了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} corresponded with him for months.

101
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,840
你还记得他的名字吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Do you recall his name?

102
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,260
我诊所附近的一间公寓马上要出租了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} There's a flat adjacent to my surgery that's gone to let...

103
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,240
不要
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  No!

104
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,720
要是你不记得电话在哪怎麽办
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   What happens when you don't recall where the telephone is,

105
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,200
或者你忘了把煤气关上
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} or you forget to turn off the gas?

106
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,220
- 你不能一个人住著  - 我不是一个人住
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - You can't live alone.  - I don't live alone.

107
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,180
我有管家
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I have the housekeeper.

108
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,160
拿著这本日记
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Take this diary.

109
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,380
每次你不记得一个名字或者地方
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Each day you don't recall a name or place,

110
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,860
就在日记本上的那天做个记号
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} make a mark on the page for that day's date.

111
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,700
要是我忘记做记号呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   And if I forget to make the mark?

112
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,540
不 不 不 不要
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} No, no, no. No. No, no, no.

113
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,320
- 这是蜂王浆  - 以后我们不用这个了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - It's the royal jelly.  - Yes, well, we're not using it anymore.

114
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,120
我们用这个
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Instead, we're going to use this.

115
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,800
- 它叫岩山椒  - 这是吃的吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - It's called prickly ash.  - Is it food?

116
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,380
唉  看著像是下水道里挖出来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Eurgh. Looks like it came out the down-spout.

117
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,820
从日本来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   It came from Japan.

118
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,720
难怪这麽可怕
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   That makes all the difference.

119
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,840
像用蜂王浆一样把它加到茶和咖啡里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   You add it in as you would the royal jelly, in the tea or the coffee.

120
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,560
而且你应该试试用这个做饭
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And you should try cooking with it

121
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,160
让你的拿手菜更上一层楼
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} to enhance your specialities.

122
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,600
福尔摩斯先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Mr. Holmes?

123
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,480
福尔摩斯先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mr. Holmes?

124
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,300
民喜梅崎
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Tamiki Umezaki.

125
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,310
欢迎来日本
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Welcome to Japan.

126
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,120
您能接受邀请  我真是深感荣幸
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I am so honoured you have accepted my invitation.

127
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,360
今晚在我家过夜  明天我们开始搜寻
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} We spend tonight at my house. Tomorrow we begin our search.

128
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,040
您的这本书我收藏二十年了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I have owned your book for 20 years.

129
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,860
第一次印刷出版的时候我就买了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I purchased my copy when it first appeared in print.

130
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,820
我希望您赐我一个签名
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I hope you'll do me the honour of a personal inscription.

131
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,520
噢  好  当然了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Oh, yes. Of course.

132
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,420
梅崎先生  岩山椒生长的地方离这儿多远
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mr. Umezaki, how close to the city does the prickly ash grow?

133
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,080
大部分生长在海边
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   It is found mostly near the sea.

134
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,020
我们得走多远
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  And how far shall we have to go?

135
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,160
坐火车需要两天
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Where I am thinking is two days' journey by train.

136
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,240
您很心急吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You are very eager?

137
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,280
有个项目我正进行到一半  我想早点完成
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I'm in the middle of a project that I'm keen to finish

138
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,400
我的思维得保持在最佳状态
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and my wits must be at their sharpest.

139
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,500
我希望能尽快从它的药效中获益
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I want to be able to benefit from the effect as soon as possible.

140
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,100
- 有那麽急吗  - 恐怕是的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - It's that urgent?  - I fear it's so.

141
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,580
您是个很伟大的侦探
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   You are very great detective!

142
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,280
非常感谢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Thank you very much.

143
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,980
我妈妈想知道你您有没有带那顶大名鼎鼎的帽子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   My mother, she wonders if you have brought your famous hat.

144
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,380
噢  那顶猎鹿帽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Oh, the deer stalker.

145
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,840
那是插画师臆想出来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  That was an embellishment of the illustrator.

146
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,960
我从没戴过
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I've never worn one.

147
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,260
- 那烟斗呢  - 我更喜欢雪茄
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - And the pipe?  - I prefer a cigar.

148
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,100
我和华生说过  如果我哪天要亲自写点什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I told Watson, if I ever write a story myself,

149
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,840
那一定是为了纠正因为他的想像而造成的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} it will be to correct the million misconceptions

150
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,100
那些成百上千的错误认识
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} created by his imaginative licence.

151
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,140
您写了吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Did you write such a story?

152
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,520
我现在打算写了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   But I'm trying to do so now.

153
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,060
我必须在死之前瞭解此事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I must finish with you before I die.

154
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,180
所以你是为你妻子来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} "So you've come about your wife."

155
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,500
你是为你妻子来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  "You've come about your wife."

156
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,560
你是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} "You've come..."

157
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,640
罗杰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Roger.

158
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,580
这儿
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Here.

159
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,060
午饭后见
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'll see you after lunch.

160
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,120
我需要你帮忙料理蜜蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'm going to need some help with the bees.

161
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,680
所以你找到正确的地址了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} So you found the right address.

162
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,260
221B好心的门卫告诉了我地址
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   A friendly porter at 221B.

163
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,460
只是为了误导好奇的人们  小小地虚构了一下
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  It's just a minor fiction to mislead the curious.

164
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,020
大部分都是美国人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Most of them seem to be American.

165
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,140
请坐  凯尔默先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Have a seat, Mr. Kelmot.

166
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,710
那麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} So...

167
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,520
你是为你妻子来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} you've come about your wife.

168
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,620
- 你怎麽知道的  - 不重要
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - How did you know? - It doesn't matter.

169
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,600
把你要说的都告诉我吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Tell me what you have to say.

170
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,560
我的妻子名叫安
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   My wife is named Ann.

171
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,160
她母亲在生产时去世了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Her mother died in childbirth.

172
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,980
她爸爸是个上校
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Her father was a colonel,

173
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,840
在瓦济里斯坦的一次行动里丧生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} killed in that business at Waziristan.

174
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,320
我们非常想要孩子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   We wanted very much to have children.

175
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,340
怀第一个孩子的时候  她3个月就流产了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} She lost our first child in her third month...

176
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,700
第二个孩子4个月流产
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Our second in her fourth.

177
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,340
他们说  再怀孕会很危险
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   We were told it was too dangerous to try again.

178
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,400
安为此心烦意乱
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Ann was... distraught.

179
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,740
就好像每次失去的都是一个真正的孩子  而不是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  It was as though each of them lost had been a real child, as opposed to...

180
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,710
谢谢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Thank you.

181
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,020
有一次  她甚至坚持让我准备了一对刻好的墓碑
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} For a time, she even insisted I have a pair of headstones carved

182
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,360
放倒我们的墓地里去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and placed in our cemetery plot,

183
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,160
就好像他们的身体真的埋在下面一样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} as if their bodies were buried beneath.

184
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,680
她极其需要做点什麽来缓解这种危险的忧鬱
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} She was in desperate need of something to soothe this dangerous melancholy.

185
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,220
她喜欢音乐  于是我建议她学学玻璃琴
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} She liked music so I suggested the glass armonica.

186
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,430
玻璃琴
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   The armonica?

187
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,180
我父亲最珍爱的物件
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   My father's most prized possession.

188
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,120
他每天都弹  直到他去世的那天为止
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   He played it constantly till the day he died.

189
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,560
我把琴带回家
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  I had it brought to the house

190
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,600
安排了一个月的课程
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   and arranged a month's worth of lessons.

191
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,600
每周一个小时
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   One hour per week.

192
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,880
很快  安就问我能不能增加课时  每周两次
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Soon Ann asked me if she could increase the lessons to twice a week.

193
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,600
后来变成三次  再后来变成每天
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Then three times. Then every day.

194
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,560
她培养起了这项新爱好  你也希望她这麽做
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  So, she took up the avocation you hoped she would.

195
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,680
你为什麽来找我  凯尔默先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Why are you here, Mr. Kelmot?

196
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,200
福尔摩斯先生  我的安变了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Mr. Holmes, my Ann has changed.

197
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,860
而且不光是那些课 也不光是她对乐器的痴迷
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And it isn't just the lessons or her obsession with the instrument.

198
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,160
有一次我在房间外面
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  One day I was outside the room

199
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,840
突然弹奏的声音停了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   and suddenly her playing stopped.

200
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,580
接著我听到她说  声音很清晰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   And I heard her saying, quite clearly...

201
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,580
格蕾丝  詹姆斯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Grace? James?

202
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,480
这是你们给孩子准备的名字
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Those were to be the names of your children?

203
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,600
我当面问安的时候  她否认了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   When I confronted Ann, she denied it.

204
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,180
所以我不再让她弹玻璃琴  也不再允许她上课
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} So I forbad her playing the armonica and I forbad her taking the lessons.

205
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,580
给她上课的那个女人  西莫尔女士
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The woman who teaches them, Madame Schirmer,

206
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,400
是有危险信仰的人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} is a person of dangerous beliefs.

207
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,840
一个音乐老师的危险信仰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  The dangerous beliefs of a music teacher?

208
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,560
她给安施咒了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   She's put a spell on Ann,

209
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,040
玩弄她本就脆弱的思想 我不知道原因
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} preying upon her weak frame of mind, for what reason I cannot say.

210
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,060
你有证据吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Have you proof of this?

211
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,300
遵从我的要求 她不再见西莫尔女士了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Following my instructions, she stopped seeing Madame Schirmer.

212
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:21,220
但我在信箱里收到了3张这个女人发来的收据
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I received in the post...three receipts from the woman.

213
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,420
每张对应一节玻璃琴课
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Each for the payment of one armonica lesson.

214
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,740
又一次  安否认了这件事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Again Ann denied it.

215
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,700
因此  我禁止她再从银行里取钱了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Consequently, my wife is no longer permitted to withdraw money from the bank.

216
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,880
昨天  我跟踪了安
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Then yesterday, I followed Ann

217
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,960
去了那个女人给她上课的地方
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   to the place where the woman gives her lessons.

218
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,280
我在人行道上都能听到她弹奏的声音
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Even on the pavement below I could hear her playing.

219
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,240
于是我走进去  但那个西莫尔说她不在
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Naturally, I went inside, but the Schirmer woman said,

220
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,860
你妻子不在这
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} "Your wife is not here."

221
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,840
昨晚  我质问安
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Last night, I questioned Ann.

222
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,020
她说她没去过西莫尔女士的家
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   And she said that she hadn't been to Madame Schirmer's rooms.

223
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,020
近几周都没去过了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Not for weeks.

224
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,080
你有你妻子的肖像吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Do you have a portrait of your wife?

225
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,620
回答最后一个问题  我就接你的案子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I shall take your case if you answer just one last question.

226
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,320
好的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Certainly.

227
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,600
你妻子用什麽香水
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  What perfume does your wife wear?

228
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,580
罗杰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Roger.

229
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,180
很晚了  外面亮得像那场大空袭一样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It's late. Lights out like it's the Blitz.

230
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,270
看看你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Look at you.

231
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,160
你还记得你爸爸吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Do you remember your dad?

232
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,160
我记得他拉著我的手  带我去海边
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I remember him holding my hand and taking me to the sea.

233
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,940
你不记得  那是照片里的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   You're not remembering. That's the picture.

234
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,220
那些睡前现编的故事呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} What about the invisible stories?

235
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,260
有时候在睡前  你爸爸会编一些故事 他会
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Some nights at bedtime, your dad would make up stories. He'd...

236
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,120
他会说  说三个东西
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  he'd say, "Give me three things."

237
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,120
你会说  球 猫和罗杰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And you'd say, "A ball, a cat and Roger."

238
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,680
然后他会
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} So then he'd...

239
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,660
他会编一些故事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} he'd make up some tale

240
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,940
一个球有一隻猫  猫的名字叫罗杰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} about a ball that had a pet cat named Roger.

241
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,080
从来都是一个这个  一个那个  和罗杰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Always a something and something and Roger.

242
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
你一个故事都不记得了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You don't remember any of the invisible stories?

243
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,920
不记得了  你记得吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   No. Do you?

244
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,460
我一直都不擅长讲故事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I was never any good at stories.

245
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,150
睡个好觉
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Sleep well.

246
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,180
首先你得知道  这并不危险
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   The first thing to know is there's no danger.

247
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,480
蜜蜂没兴趣伤害你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Bees aren't interested in harming you.

248
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,620
它们唯一关心的就是自我保护
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Their only concern is self-preservation.

249
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,080
- 避开人类吗  - 它们太聪明了 人类伤不了他们
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - From people?  - They're much too clever for people.

250
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,900
他们的敌人是黄蜂  疾病和捕食者
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Their enemies are the weather, disease and predators.

251
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,560
黄蜂是他们的头号天敌
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The wasp is their particular antagonist.

252
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,020
你知道吗  一隻黄蜂可以在一分钟内杀死40只蜜蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Did you know that one wasp can kill 40 honey bees in under a minute?

253
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,220
因此  我们一点都不喜欢黄蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} In consequence, we do not like wasps.

254
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,940
是  先生  我们不喜欢黄蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Yes, sir. We do not like wasps.

255
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,160
蜂后掌管整个群体
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The queen runs the colony.

256
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,200
工蜂伺候蜂后
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The drones service the queen.

257
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,920
手抬起来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Hands up.

258
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,560
工人就是要干活  理所应当
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Workers do the work. As it should be.

259
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,140
我们需要关注的是最近蜂群数量的减少
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Of concern is the latest decrease in the bee population.

260
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,160
找到了问题所在  现在我们得解决它
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} We've identified the problem, and now we must solve it.

261
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,900
好  找到了  走吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Right. There you are. Off you go.

262
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,320
你被蜜蜂咬过吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Have you ever been bitten by a bee?

263
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,200
是蛰  蜜蜂没有牙齿
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Stung. Bees don't have teeth.

264
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,120
我被蛰过
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Yes, I have.

265
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,080
不是经常发生吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Well, not often, though.

266
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,560
7,816次
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   7,816 times.

267
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,100
我会计数的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I keep a record.

268
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,640
你看上去一点儿也不害怕
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You're not entirely dreadful.

269
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,660
你被咬过吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  You ever been bit?

270
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,880
没  我还没被咬过
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  No. I have never been bit.

271
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,300
人们总是在和蜜蜂打交道  不是吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Well, people work with bees all the time, don't they?

272
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,400
蜂王浆是什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   What is royal jelly?

273
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,300
是工蜂的一种特殊分泌物
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}    It's a special secretion of the worker bees.

274
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,540
- 名字里有个王是因为  - 这是给蜂后吃的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - And it's royal because?  - It feeds the queen.

275
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,920
对啦
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Bravo.

276
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,700
蜂王浆的治癒能力促成了我的专著
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It was the jelly's curative powers that prompted my monograph,

277
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,240
《蜂王浆的价值》一书
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The Value of Royal Jelly

278
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,320
还有《有关岩山椒的潜在保健功能》
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} with Further Comments on the Potential Health Benefits of Prickly Ash.

279
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,820
- 那是什麽  - 岩山椒吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - What's that?  - Prickly ash, hmm?

280
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:15,900
在日语里  这是是山椒的通称
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Well, in Japanese,  hire sansho is the common word for zanthoxylum piperitum.

281
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,520
以前被拿来治疗各种退化性疾病
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It's used to treat various degenerative diseases.

282
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,200
贫血  血液循环病  关节炎
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Anaemia, circulatory conditions... arthritis and...

283
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,940
那个叫什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Hmm. What's it called?

284
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,280
噢  还有衰老
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Oh. Senility.

285
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,080
那是在开玩笑
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} That was a witticism.

286
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:45,020
最近的研究表明岩山椒比蜂王浆还有营养
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The newest research suggests that prickly ash has far more promise than royal jelly.

287
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,980
以后我们就认准它了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Henceforth, prickly ash is all that we should use.

288
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,820
你还写了关于这对夫妇的什麽了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Have you written more about the man and his wife?

289
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,220
- 别心急  - 是真的吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - All in good time. - Is it real?

290
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,680
当然了 捏造的故事不值一钱
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Of course. Fiction is worthless!

291
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,260
你停下的地方
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The place you stopped.

292
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,760
为什麽你想知道他妻子的香水是什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Why do you want to know the wife's perfume?

293
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,680
- 玫瑰庄园是吗  - 对的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Cameo Rose, is it?  - Yes.

294
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,660
总是会留香
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Always leaves a trace.

295
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,220
西莫尔女士
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Madame Schirmer.

296
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,900
西莫尔女士 我是托马斯·凯尔默 让我进去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Madame Schirmer, this is Thomas Kelmot. Let me in.

297
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,800
西莫尔女士
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Madame Schirmer!

298
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,120
凯尔默 我警告过你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Herr  Kelmot, I did warn!

299
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,740
你再来我就要报警了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You come, I call the Metropolitan Police!

300
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,300
女士 我朋友是那种 如果你拒绝让我们进去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Madame, my friend's emotional state is such that, if denied entry,

301
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,240
他就可能会发脾气的人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} he might not be able to restrain his passions.

302
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,080
让我们俩进去吧 我来负全责
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Allow us both in, and I will take full responsibility.

303
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,760
- 感激不尽  - 这是哪位
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Thank you so much.  - Who is this?

304
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,960
- 这位先生是个侦探  - 是吗 请让我看看他的证件
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - This gentleman is a detective. -  Ja?  His badge, please?

305
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,660
他的名字是夏洛克·福尔摩斯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} His name is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

306
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,980
你介意我关门吗 风好大
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You don't mind if I close this, do you? Such a draught.

307
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,880
不介意 我在杂志上看过夏洛克·福尔摩斯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} No. I have seen Sherlock Holmes in the magazines.

308
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,020
他是戴著帽子叼著烟斗的 绝对不是这个人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} With the hat and the pipe. It was never this person.

309
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,400
西莫尔女士 我看到安进来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Madame Schirmer, I saw Ann enter this place,

310
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,900
我命令你交出她
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I demand you produce her.

311
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,160
你妻子不在这里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Your wife is not here.

312
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,680
- 你上次就这麽说过  - 你是在质疑我的诚实度吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - You said that last time. - You question my truth?

313
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,300
奥斯瓦尔德 亲爱的 我们想知道你是不是这位男士的妻子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Oswald, my dear, it is a wish to know if you are this man's wife.

314
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,760
- 不是  - 你可能在伪装
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - No. - You could be in disguise.

315
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,280
- 我不这麽认为  - 看吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - I don't think so. -  Voila!

316
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,660
那是英国人叫做厕所的地方
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It is, I believe, what the English call a water closet.

317
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,900
她就在这 我看到过她
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} She was here! I saw her!

318
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,240
凯尔默先生 如果你坚持要找你妻子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mr. Kelmot, if you insist on following your wife

319
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,480
而你又雇我去做同样的事情的时候
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} when you have employed me to do the same,

320
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,400
我们中的一个就会被解雇
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} one or the other of us will find himself made redundant.

321
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,600
- 他疯掉了  -他是个蠢货
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - He is distraught.  - He is a fool.

322
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,240
玻璃琴过去被认为是用于黑魔法的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The armonica used to be thought of as an instrument of the black arts,

323
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,780
说是用于召唤死去的人的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} said to be used to call for the dead.

324
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,800
这似乎和玻璃的特质有关
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Something to do with the nature of the glasses.

325
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,940
你不会真觉得这是真的吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You don't believe that, surely?

326
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,140
我信不信并不重要
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} What I believe plays no part in this matter.

327
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,820
凯尔默女士最后一次什麽时候来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} When was Mrs. Kelmot last here?

328
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,290
好几周之前
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Weeks now.

329
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,760
所以你给她寄的是奥斯瓦尔德课程的收据
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Then the receipts you posted to her address were for Oswald's lessons.

330
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,020
凯尔默在为他们买单
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mrs. Kelmot is paying for them.

331
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:03,200
弗拉·凯尔默很有热情 但依然不专业
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Frau  Kelmot is passionate, but an amateur.

332
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,940
她知道奥斯瓦尔德有这个天赋
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} She knew it was Oswald who has the gift.

333
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,060
- 你知道她之前不在这里  - 当然
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - You knew she was not here.  - Of course.

334
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,620
奥斯瓦尔德身上没有她的味道
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Oswald doesn't wear her scent.

335
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,680
我还是不信你就是夏洛克·福尔摩斯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You are still not Sherlock Holmes!

336
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,460
真贴心
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} How considerate.

337
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,820
你在等我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You waited for me.

338
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,120
你在干嘛
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} What are you doing?

339
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,480
试试看能不能分辨出我去过哪里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Trying to see if I can tell where I've been.

340
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,680
你自己不知道吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Don't you know?

341
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,360
福尔摩斯先生能通过观察一个人知晓很多事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mr. Holmes can tell things like that just from looking at a person.

342
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,800
- 你上哪去  - 去看看蜜蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Where are you off to?  - See to the bees!

343
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,500
你必须先把早餐吃掉
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You'll eat your breakfast first!

344
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,180
我那天收到你阿姨的一封信
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Got a letter from your aunt the other day.

345
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,540
她说在朴次茅斯有对夫妻开了一间旅馆
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} She says there's a couple in Portsmouth opening a hotel there.

346
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,180
正需要个管家
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Need a housekeeper.

347
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,380
我们为什麽会想去住在朴次茅斯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Why would we want to live in Portsmouth?

348
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,180
- 我们不能永远呆在这里  - 为什麽不能
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Can't stay here forever.  - Why not?

349
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,880
- 我们就是不能  - 朴次茅斯有什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Because we can't.   - What's in Portsmouth?

350
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,380
- 这对夫妻在那开了间旅馆  - 你说过了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - This couple are opening a hotel there...  - You said that.

351
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,460
你得把所有东西吃完了才能离开这张桌子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You'll leave the table when you're finished and not before.

352
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,680
我没吃完呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'm not finished.

353
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,000
你别吃那个日本垃圾
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You don't eat that Japanese muck.

354
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,620
这可是岩山椒
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It's  hiro sansho.

355
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,160
- 我知道你喜欢你喜欢在蜂房工作  - 那是个养蜂场
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - I know you like working with the hive...  - It's an apiary.

356
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,780
并且你喜欢冒险 当然我们不该靠得太近
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And you like being given responsibility, but I shouldn't get too close.

357
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,460
- 蜜蜂不咬人的  - 我不是在说蜜蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Bees don't bite.  - I don't mean the bees.

358
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,520
福尔摩斯先生不可能永远呆在这里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mr. Holmes won't be here forever.

359
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,480
你阿姨说旅馆说不定还能给你留个位置
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Your aunt says this hotel might even take you on.

360
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,300
- 他们有行李搬运工和  - 他们已经有了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - They got porters and...  - Have porters.

361
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,260
好了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Finished.

362
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,360
药商把你的东西送来了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Chemist delivered your things.

363
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,680
要我叫罗杰来打开这个木箱吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Shall I have Roger open the crate?

364
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,360
不用 我弄完自己来开
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} No. I'll see to it when I'm finished.

365
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,860
好的 先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Yes, sir.

366
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,460
先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Sir?

367
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,520
我知道罗杰是您的帮手  他是个好孩子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I know Roger's been a help to you. He's a good boy.

368
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,860
他总是那麽聪明伶俐
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He's always been clever.

369
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,900
我和他父亲都不瞭解他感兴趣的事情
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} His dad and I weren't the sort to know the things a boy like Roger takes interest in.

370
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,740
杰出的孩子都有著平庸的父母
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Exceptional children are often the product of unremarkable parents.

371
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,440
我有一个住在朴茨茅斯的姐姐
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I've got a sister. She lives in Portsmouth.

372
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,960
她的几个熟人朋友在那里开了一家酒店
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} A couple of her acquaintants are opening a private hotel there,

373
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,600
他们想让我和罗杰过去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} say they're willing to take Roger and me on.

374
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,400
你有一个姐姐
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You have a sister?

375
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,340
真是没想到
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Never would have thought it.

376
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,720
是薪水太少吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Is this a matter of wages?

377
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,500
不
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} No.

378
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,860
我会考虑下这个提议
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I shall take this under advisement.

379
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,560
你走的话  我妈妈会伤心的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} My mother was sad to see you leave.

380
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,220
我现在为我没有戴猎鹿帽而感到抱歉
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'm rather sorry now I didn't bring the deerstalker.

381
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,360
你说过你从不戴那个
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You said you never wore one.

382
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,100
是的  但这可能让她开心
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Well, yes, but it would've pleased her.

383
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,240
她喜欢小说里的那个  而你是真实的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} She wanted the fictional. You are the real.

384
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,920
我不这麽认为
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Well, I'm not sure that's true.

385
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,720
我一直很真实  直到约翰将我变成小说人物
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I think I was real once until John made me into fiction.

386
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,480
那之后我就没什麽选择了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And then after that, I had little choice.

387
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,840
要麽扮演成他描绘的角色
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Play the part as he'd fashioned it,

388
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,280
要麽变得完全不同
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} or become its contradiction.

389
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,480
我其实很喜欢烟斗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'm actually quite fond of a pipe,

390
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,040
但在烟斗成为我的标志后
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} but to smoke it, especially in public,

391
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,920
在公共场合抽看上去就很庸俗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} after it became so well known a prop, seemed vulgar.

392
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,060
所以华生医生的想像影响了你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} So, Dr. Watson's imagination changed you?

393
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,920
我不喜欢想像
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I've never had much use for imagination.

394
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,640
我更喜欢事实
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I prefer facts.

395
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,160
当我还是个孩子时  我父亲带我来这里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} My father would bring me here as a child.

396
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,900
这里被设计成微缩景观
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It was designed as a miniature.

397
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,800
我们在这里像巨人一般
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} We walk as giants.

398
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,440
这些石头代表他所失去的生命
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The stones represent the lives of those he has lost.

399
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,900
夏洛克先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Sherlock-san!

400
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,860
- Hire sansho  - 岩山椒
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Hire sansho?  - Prickly ash.

401
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,020
- 福尔摩斯先生  - 嗯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Mr. Holmes. - Hmm?

402
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,940
现在检查蜜蜂太迟了吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Too late to check on the bees?

403
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,000
一点儿也不
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Not in the least.

404
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,160
蜜蜂检查
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Bee check!

405
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,120
- 它们很淡定   - 是的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - They're quiet.  - Yes.

406
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,620
当蜜蜂死后会怎麽样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} What happens when the bees die?

407
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,200
这算是一个玄学问题吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Is this a metaphysical question?

408
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,600
我的意思是 你会悼念他们吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I mean, do you mourn them?

409
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,080
我从未悼念过他们
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Oh, I can't say that I've ever mourned

410
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,580
不管是蜜蜂的死亡还是其他的灭亡
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} the dead, bees or otherwise.

411
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,800
我更关注当下
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I concentrate on circumstances.

412
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,120
他们怎麽死的 谁要为此负责
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} How did it die? Who was responsible?

413
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,900
死亡 悲伤 悼念 这都很常见
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Death, grieving, mourning, they're all commonplace.

414
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,080
而逻辑十分稀有
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Logic is rare, and so...

415
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,560
我专注于逻辑
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I dwell on logic.

416
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,880
谢谢 好心的先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Well, thank you, kind sir.

417
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,820
- 晚安 蜜蜂  - 好梦  蜜蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Night, bees.  - Sweet dreams, bees.

418
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,260
我们明天去游泳怎麽样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Now, what do you say we go for a dip tomorrow?

419
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,340
- 在海里  - 是的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - In the sea? - Yes.

420
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,080
- 水可能会凉的  - 对血液循环好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - It'll be brisk.  - Good for the blood!

421
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,660
好吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} All right, then.

422
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,840
你喜欢什麽类型的书
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} What sort of books do you like, hmm?

423
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:14,540
除了华生的故事和与蜜蜂相关的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Apart from Dr. Watson's stories and books about bees.

424
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,140
我只有这两种书
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Those are all the books I have.

425
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,180
这里就有一个很好的图书馆
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Well, there's a perfectly good library right here, inside.

426
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,500
你可以拿走任何你喜欢的书
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You can take any book you like.

427
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,120
福尔摩斯先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mr. Holmes?

428
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,740
我们要去游泳了吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Are we going for our swim?

429
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,960
我已经检查过蜜蜂了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I've already seen to the apiary.

430
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,240
你还好吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Are you all right?

431
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,700
我很好 我很
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'm perfectly... I'm quite...

432
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,540
特别好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Perfectly fine.

433
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,980
好吧 罗杰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} All right, Roger.

434
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,940
你先走  我一会儿赶上你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You go along. I'll catch you up.

435
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,240
罗杰 快来  要不今天要浪费了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Roger! Come along or we'll lose the day.

436
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,000
很好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Well done.

437
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,540
这是她的照片吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The photograph is her, isn't it?

438
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,000
故事里的那个女人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The woman in the story.

439
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,000
是的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Yes.

440
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,040
她是你写书的原因吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Is she why you're writing it?

441
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,840
我并不是在写
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I wouldn't say I was writing it...

442
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,880
我在试著记起它们
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It's more I'm trying to remember it.

443
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,640
谢谢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Ah, thank you.

444
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,580
几个月前 我的哥哥麦考夫去世了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} A few months ago, my brother Mycroft died.

445
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,480
他的第欧根尼俱乐部
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} His club, the Diogenes,

446
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,920
让我去伦敦取回他的东西
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} asked that I go up to London to retrieve his things.

447
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,160
他们给我一个小箱子 里面有华生写的故事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I was given a small chest  containing the Watson stories,

448
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,380
我一则都没有读过
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} none of which I'd ever actually read.

449
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,440
就像约翰通常说的那样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} They were as John  always described them,

450
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,720
它们是用散文形式写出来的惊悚小说
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} penny dreadfuls with an elevated prose style.

451
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,620
但是其中过一个标题 激发了我的兴趣
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} But one of the titles  piqued my interest.

452
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,540
故事很熟悉
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The story was familiar,

453
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,100
但结局很不对劲
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} but its ending felt very,very wrong.

454
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,800
我从没看过任何电影改编
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'd not seen any of the cinematic depictions.

455
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,440
但幸运的是  很快就有了这样一个机会
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} But by a fortunate chance, an opportunity soon arose.

456
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,600
看到一个人在银幕上有十二米高
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It's strange to see a semblance  of one's self 40 feet high...

457
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,820
- 我为安的清醒感到担忧  - 因为她的神智清晰而担忧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} -  I fear for my Ann's sanity.   -  Fear for her sanity?

458
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,880
年轻人  你应该担心自己的生命
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Dear man, you should fear for your life.

459
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,300
什麽意思
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Whatever do you mean?

460
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,100
谋杀 凯尔莫先生  这是谋杀
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Murder, Mr. Kelmot. Murder.

461
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,000
然后像演哑剧一样被演出来的感觉很奇怪
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} ...and played as a character out of pantomime.

462
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,380
下毒
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Poisoned?

463
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,340
到底什麽意思
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} With what means have I?

464
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,620
你的玻璃琴 西莫尔女士
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Your armonica,  Madame Schirmer.

465
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,140
- 荒唐  - 或者说是玻璃
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} -  Preposterous!   -  Or rather, the glasses.

466
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,540
是玻璃里的导线让它有了独特的声音
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It is the lead in the crystal that creates the unique tone.

467
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,820
毒药通过皮肤被血液吸收
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Absorbed into the blood  through the skin,

468
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:55,420
很少的量就可以让人产生幻觉
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} small exposure can produce  confusion, hallucinations.

469
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:02,480
持续接触导致精神错乱与死亡
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} But constant, obsessive contact  can end in insanity and death.

470
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,400
每个转折点都以捻鬍鬚来标志开始
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Every plot twist  came with a twirl of a moustache

471
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,560
又以感叹号代表结束
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and ended  in an exclamation mark.

472
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,540
这场未遂的谋杀设计得十分巧妙
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Our would-be murderer is ingenious.

473
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,800
你不会是说
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Surely you're not  referring to...

474
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,160
凯尔莫夫人  您需要为您自己
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'm afraid, Mrs. Kelmot,  you will have to find yourself

475
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,520
找一个新的音乐老师了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} a new music teacher.

476
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:23,900
哦
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Oh.

477
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,640
全是垃圾
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Absolute rubbish!

478
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,800
那个德国女人有什麽动机杀安呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} What possible motive could that German woman have had to kill Ann?

479
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,680
那晚我一直在寻找
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} That night I searched for something

480
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,500
试图记起原本的案件
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} to jog my memory of the actual case.

481
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,180
找到了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And there it was...

482
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,020
她的照片
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Her picture.

483
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,640
你知道 几年前 我能告诉你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You know, a few years ago, I could have told you everything

484
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,300
照片里的女人的任何事情
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} about the woman in that photograph.

485
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,500
当然 我能记起她最后是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Certainly I'd recall what had become of her,

486
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,660
受害者还是凶手
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} whether she was victim or culprit.

487
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,460
但是那晚
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} But that night...

488
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,180
我不记得任何事了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I couldn't remember any of it.

489
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,700
我唯一记得就是那是我的最后一案
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} All I knew for certain was that the case was my last

490
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,740
是我退出侦探生涯  到这里来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and it was why I left the profession, came down here,

491
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,060
养蜜蜂的原因
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} retired to my bees.

492
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,700
所以我决定把这个案子原原本本地写下来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} So, I decided to write the story down on paper

493
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,000
而不是像约翰写的那种
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} as it was, not as John made it.

494
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,320
在我死前纠正它
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Get it right before I die.

495
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,300
你不会死的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You're not going to die.

496
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,740
罗杰 我已经93岁了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Roger. I'm 93.

497
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,760
我有一个叔叔活到了102岁
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I had a great uncle who lived to be 102.

498
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,420
噢  这可决定了我的命运
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Well, then, that seals my fate.

499
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,140
你认识两个人都活这麽久的几率能有多少
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} What are the odds that you would know two men who would live that long?

500
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,580
好吧 那我不认识他
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Well, I didn't actually know him.

501
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,280
我要去检查蜜蜂了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'll see to the bees.

502
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,520
- 哦 福尔摩斯先生  - 福尔摩斯先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Ow! Mr. Holmes!  - Mr. Holmes!

503
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,360
啊  啊
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Aargh. Aargh.

504
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,060
我被蛰了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I've been stung.

505
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,940
与黄蜂不同 蜜蜂会把刺留下
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Unlike the wasp, the bee always leaves its sting.

506
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,700
我一定是做了什麽蠢事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I must have done something stupid.

507
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:41,040
不 没有 有时候就会无缘无故被蛰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Oh, no. Sometimes... there's no reason at all.

508
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,100
喝点儿盐水
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Right. Salt water, you drink that.

509
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,600
或者用洋葱汁以防感染
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Or onion juice to prevent serious consequences.

510
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,780
不要告诉你妈妈
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And no need to tell your mother about all this.

511
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,500
我们可不想让她担心  对吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} We don't want to worry her, do we?

512
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,780
你会继续写那个故事的吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You going to go back to the story?

513
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,960
这算是你的封口费吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Is that the price for your silence?

514
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,200
我什麽都不说
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Tight lips.

515
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,420
下午好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Good afternoon.

516
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,380
- 先生您需要什麽  - 要点茶  靠窗的位置
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Sir? - Tea for one in the window.

517
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,760
没问题先生  小心台阶
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Certainly, sir. Mind the step.

518
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,480
你是说他病了吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Ill, do you say?

519
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,020
只是写张支票就花费了他全部力气
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Took all the strength he had just to write out the cheque.

520
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,720
- 您的茶 先生  -谢谢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - There you are, sir. - Thank you.

521
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,880
您的现金
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Well, here we are.

522
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,820
- 你以前用过这个吗  -从没有
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Have you used this before? - No. I haven't.

523
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,560
这个毒性强劲  只要一滴就绰绰有馀
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It is highly poisonous. A drop will more than suffice.

524
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,240
谢谢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Thank you.

525
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,900
只是托马斯现在
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It's just Thomas is in such a state.

526
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,560
非要让我确定一下
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He insisted I made certain.

527
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,560
请告诉科尔莫先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Reassure Mr. Kelmot

528
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,240
自从他口授遗嘱以来没有改动过任何细节
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} that the particulars of the will have not changed since he dictated them.

529
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,420
你的财产会指定赠予给他  他的会给你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Your possessions are bequeathed to him, as his are to you.

530
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,280
- 抱歉  打扰一下  - 小姐  怎麽啦
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Excuse me. - Yes, miss?

531
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,960
8:10的那趟是快车吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Is the 8:10 the fast service?

532
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,180
8:10那趟是慢车  中间经停的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   The 8:10's the slow one, makes local stops.

533
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,980
那9:05那趟呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And the 9:05?

534
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,580
那趟是快车  直达的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  That's the fast train, goes right on through.

535
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,020
- 全部上车  -谢谢您
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - All aboard! - Thank you.

536
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,220
全部上车
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  All aboard.

537
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,720
啊  蜜蜂都被你吸引了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Honeybees are attracted to you.

538
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,400
是香味  玫瑰庄园的味道
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It's the scent. Cameo Rose.

539
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,780
- 哦  -她以为你是朵花呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Oh. - She thinks you're a flower.

540
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,980
这个小家伙现在肯定已经晕头转向了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Must confuse the little thing no end.

541
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,040
我能坐下吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} May I?

542
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,320
坐吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Oh.

543
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,180
非常感谢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Very kind.

544
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,200
啊  鸢尾花  生长能力惊人的东西
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Ah. The iris. Amazing resilience.

545
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,280
只要有足够的阳光  它们就能长得飞快
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Enough light and they will grow

546
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,000
即使在最贫瘠的地方也是如此
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} in the most uninhabitable regions,

547
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,720
不管是沙漠  冻土  还是石缝里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} desert, cold, rock.

548
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,940
你觉得为什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Why do you suppose it is

549
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,800
像鸢尾一样渺小不起眼的植物
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} that something as small and insignificant as the iris

550
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,230
比我们更强大呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} should be so much stronger than we are?

551
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,460
也许是因为他们更少受到外界的影响
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Perhaps they're less affected by what goes on around them.

552
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,760
- 你是个植物学家吗  - 只是业馀爱好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Are you a botanist?  - Amateur only.

553
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,620
我经常沉溺在某种爱好当中不能自拔
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I am, by disposition, a hobbyist.

554
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:43,680
事实上  我有一个特殊的爱好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} In fact, if I may, there is one particular hobby

555
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,020
大概能博您一笑
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} of mine that might amuse you.

556
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,200
我能预见未来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I can see the future.

557
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,540
我能看看你的掌纹吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Shall I read your palm?

558
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,080
我发誓不会有什麽可怕的事情
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I promise I'll find nothing dreadful.

559
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,740
那我们的蜜蜂朋友怎麽办
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   What about our friend?

560
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:19,460
- 哦  -哦
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Oh.  - Oh.

561
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,640
你的父母都已经不在了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Your parents are gone.

562
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,640
你母亲很早就去世了  你的父亲最近才离世
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Your mother long ago, your father more recently.

563
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,260
你一直爱著一个
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You had love in your heart for someone...

564
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:56,080
不  不止一个人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} No, for more than one person.

565
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,460
但是他们都离开了你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} But they have left you,

566
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,080
所以你的爱无处可去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and your love for them has nowhere to go.

567
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,240
你很痛苦
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You're in pain.

568
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,200
但是你又不能让痛苦左右你的行为
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} But you must not allow your pain to guide your actions.

569
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,700
你会被引向哪儿呢  你的掌纹模糊不清
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Where that leads... The lines are not so distinct.

570
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,200
- 为什麽  -什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Why? - I beg your pardon?

571
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,960
你能看到这麽多
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   You see so much.

572
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,480
可你为什麽看不到接下来会发生什麽呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Why can't you see what happens next?

573
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,540
-你的掌纹  -你说过了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - The lines... - Yes, you said.

574
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,400
把你那套夸夸其谈的小伎俩用到别处去吧  福尔摩斯先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Ply your parlour tricks elsewhere, Mr. Holmes.

575
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,140
等等
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Wait.

576
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,020
不行
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I can't...

577
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,820
我什麽都不记得了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I can't remember.

578
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,700
妈妈  妈妈
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Mum! Mum!

579
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,280
福尔摩斯先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Mr. Holmes!

580
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,260
他是吸了那阵烟才昏过去的吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Was it the smoke knocked him out?

581
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,080
有可能
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Could have done.

582
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,160
更有可能是他站起来的时候太快了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Most likely he stood up too quickly

583
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,440
一下子失去了意识
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and lost consciousness.

584
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,240
这已经不是第一次了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It isn't the first time.

585
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:25,860
上一个管家遇到这种情况直接手足无措
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The last housekeeper didn't know what to do.

586
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,700
他肯定是打算给自己注射这个来著
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He must have decided to take it subcutaneously.

587
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,460
好吧  现在我们走不了了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Well, now we can't leave.

588
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,780
他倒是保证了这一点
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   No. Made sure of that, didn't he?

589
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,440
岩山椒呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Where's the hire sansho?

590
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,580
就是那些美洲花椒
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The prickly ash.

591
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,660
如果它不在那儿  那我也不知道
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   If it's not there, I'm sure I don't know.

592
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,400
- 你是把它扔了吗  - 我干嘛扔它
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Did you throw it out?  - Why would I do that?

593
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,520
因为你对它怀有愤怒和厌恶
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  For spite and malice.

594
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,920
你从哪儿学到的这种词
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Where'd you get words like that?

595
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,040
字典上
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The dictionary.

596
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,360
十有八九他拿著那些垃圾
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Like as not, he took the muck himself.

597
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,620
把它们和信一起全烧了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Got burnt up with the rest of it.

598
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,220
那玩意可助燃了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Those can go on the fire.

599
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,900
是福尔摩斯先生让你烧的吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Did Mr. Holmes say you were to do this?

600
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,980
他经常那样烧信的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He always disposes of that sort.

601
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,840
你怎麽知道那些信里都有什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} How do you know what sort these are?

602
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,380
你想知道都是谁在给他写信
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You want to know who writes to him?

603
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,960
自以为破了开膛手杰克案的老年人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Pensioners who think they've solved Jack the Ripper.

604
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,500
丢了猫的寡妇
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Widows who've lost their cats

605
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,960
觉得全世界只有福尔摩斯能帮她们把猫找回来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and just know he's the only man on Earth who can find them.

606
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,740
他是疯子们的最后一根救命稻草
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He's the last resort for every lunatic out there.

607
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,320
- 这不是你能决定的  - 这就是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - It's not your decision. - It is...

608
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,240
如果我一直要充当拿厨子薪水的医护人员的话
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} If I'm to be a full-bore medical staff at cook's wages.

609
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,820
他是个病人  他需要的是护士  不是管家
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He's an invalid. Needs a nurse, not a housekeeper.

610
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,320
他只不过是昏倒了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} All he did was took a fall.

611
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,640
你爷爷精神矍铄  老当益壮了60年
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Your granddad was hale and hearty

612
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,200
然后一下子摔倒了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} 60 summers then he took a fall.

613
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,020
之后只活了三个星期
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It was three weeks to the day he died.

614
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,060
他应该在医院或者护理中心之类的地方
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Should be in hospital. That or one of them places.

615
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,120
他会好起来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He'll get better!

616
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,760
他好起来的时候我们就走
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And the day he does is the day we go.

617
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:40,540
明白了吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Is that clear?

618
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,180
- 哦  -你有一封日本寄来的信
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Oh.  - Got a letter from Japan.

619
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,620
梅崎先生寄来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It's from Mr. Umezaki.

620
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,820
- 你读过吗  -没  本来想读的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Have you read it?  - No. Wanted to.

621
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,040
欲望是罪  你可是个天主教徒
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Sin of desire. You're a Catholic.

622
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,780
妈妈说大部分寄给你的信都被你扔了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mum says you throw out most of the letters you get.

623
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,280
你觉得这是为什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And why do you think that is?

624
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,980
给你写信的那些人想让你帮忙
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The people who write want you to solve things.

625
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,600
你一旦读了他们的信  你就会忍不住想帮他们的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} If you read their letters, you'd want to help.

626
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,540
哦  不  你太过奖了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Oh, no. You give me too much credit.

627
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,800
原因很简单  要是我读了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It's just if I were to read them,

628
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,840
我就会觉得有必要回信
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'd feel obliged to respond.

629
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,300
说不定梅崎先生是想让你回日本呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Perhaps Mr. Umezaki's asking you to go back to Japan.

630
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:54,900
哦  我不会再回日本的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Oh. I'll never go back to Japan.

631
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,340
- 为什麽  - 旅途漫漫而年力衰微
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Why not?  - Long journey, old man.

632
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:02,680
- 可你之前就去了  - 那是以前
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - You made it before.  - That was before.

633
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,040
说不定你还能再弄到些岩山椒呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Maybe you could get more prickly ash.

634
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,240
那对我恢复记忆一点用都没有
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The prickly ash hasn't made a bit of difference to my memory,

635
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,980
不比蜂王浆管用到哪儿去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} any more than the royal jelly did.

636
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:15,600
好吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Yes.

637
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,820
唯一能够对我的记忆有点帮助的就是你了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The only inspiration for any sort of recollections has been you.

638
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,660
继续  打开它
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Go on. You open it.

639
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,700
他肯定是要告诉我他母亲去世了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He's writing to say his mother is dead.

640
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,100
你怎麽知道
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} How could you tell?

641
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:38,380
梅崎先生曾发誓永远不再联繫我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mr. Umezaki swore that he would never contact me again.

642
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,440
唯一能够让他改变主意的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The only thing that would make him change his mind

643
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,160
就是他母亲的遗言了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} would be a deathbed instruction from his mother.

644
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,460
一个好孩子总是会听妈妈话的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} A good son always does what his mother asks.

645
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,720
福尔摩斯先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mr. Holmes!

646
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,900
你不该下床的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You're not to be out of bed!

647
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:01,120
门罗太太  我刚刚数了一下台阶
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mrs. Munro, I have counted the steps

648
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,160
从床到窗户  从窗户到
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} from the bed to the window, from the window to the...

649
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,980
不行 没有人看著  你什麽都不能干
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You're not to do anything on your own.

650
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,160
就该把你捆在床上的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You're to ring.

651
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,420
你应该摇铃的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I thought it was an imposition.

652
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,360
你要是没办法自理就更过分了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It will be an imposition if you lose your bearings

653
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,300
然后你又会倒在地板上  还得我来收拾你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and end up on the floor for me to collect!

654
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,620
没想到这居然已经成了劳资纠纷
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I hadn't realised that this had become an industrial dispute.

655
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,320
我一直在试著
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I've been trying to calculate the likelihood

656
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:57,760
计算在一个不毛之地发现岩山椒的可能性
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} that we should find hire sansho in a place so utterly devoid of life.

657
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,660
这种植物十分顽强也说不定呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Perhaps it is life reasserting itself.

658
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,820
您的岩山椒
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Hire sansho.

659
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,180
味道怎麽样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} How does it taste?

660
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,280
我们可不是为了味道去找它的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It isn't for the taste that we sought it.

661
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,680
啊  走之前
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Ah, now, before we leave,

662
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,560
有件事一定不能忘
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} there's something that I mustn't forget.

663
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:44,220
按照你要求的  我已经签好了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I've signed it, as you requested.

664
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,400
我并不确定你能不能看懂我的草书
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Not certain you can read my scrawl.

665
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:57,140
致梅崎先生  其实并没有拥有这本书很久
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} "To Mr. Umezaki, who has not owned this book for long."

666
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,880
这本书在你手上的历史并没有20年
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You haven't had this book for 20 years.

667
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,360
你是从图书馆弄来的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It came from the library.

668
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,360
这还有胶水的痕迹
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The glue mark shows where you removed

669
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,720
说明你把贴在这的封装卡给撕掉了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} the card jacket.

670
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,960
你对蜜蜂  蜂王浆  还有美洲胡椒根本一窍不通
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You know nothing about bees or royal jelly or prickly ash.

671
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,720
能让你来这儿就够了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Enough to bring you here.

672
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,760
过去几个月来咱们一直通信
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} During our correspondence over the last few months...

673
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,000
你不熟悉我的名字吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} was my name not familiar to you?

674
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:22,220
-并没有  -那我父亲的名字呢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - No. - My father's, then?

675
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,480
益男梅崎
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Masuo Umezaki?

676
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,220
我不认识你父亲
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I never knew your father.

677
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,840
他曾经是个外交官  在伦敦工作  很多年前了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He was a diplomat in London, years ago.

678
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,120
他喜欢跟英国文化有关的一切
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He loved all things English.

679
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,800
他送我的第一个礼物是个板球拍
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The first gift he gave to me was a cricket bat.

680
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,360
这是第二个
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The second was this.

681
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:46,360
英文版的  他说这对我的学习有帮助
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} In English, so as to "assist my education."

682
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:04,100
我咨询了一位伟大的侦探  夏洛克·福尔摩斯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} "After consulting with the very great detective Sherlock Holmes,

683
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:07,800
我发现最好的办法
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} "I realise it's in the best interests of us all

684
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,300
就是我无限期地留在英国
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} "that I remain in England indefinitely.

685
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,820
从这本书里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} "You will see from this book

你会发现他非常聪明睿智
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} "that he is a very wise and intelligent man,

687
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,940
并且他说  这件事绝不能掉以轻心
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and that his say in this matter should not be taken lightly."

688
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,920
从那以后我们再也没有收到他的消息
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} We never heard from him again.

689
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,360
- 对不起  -我母亲已经快要去世了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - I'm sorry. - My mother is dying.

690
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:30,080

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} She grew old without a husband. All because of you.

691
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,360

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Masuo vanished from your life and

695
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,520

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  I arrived... in the form of a book.

696
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,020
一个取代了另一个  就是这样
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} One replaced the other, as it were.

697
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,440
我建议你和你妈妈面对这个事实
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I suggest you and your mother take whatever time you have

698
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,980
花多长时间都不为过
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} to come to terms with the facts of the case.

699
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,220

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} A man abandoned his family and wrote his son a story.

700

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He wouldn't be the first to cloak his cowardice in a flag of sacrifice.

701
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:14,580
我很抱歉
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'm sorry.

702
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,500
但我和你父亲从未相识过
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} But I never knew your father.

703
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,900
我不该再继续用疑问打扰您了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  I shall not bother you any longer with my questions.

704
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:34,860

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} But if the prickly ash succeeds, you will let me know?

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I look like I've been attacked by the Hound of the Baskervilles.

爆发式的死亡
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   An outbreak of mortality.

725
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,960

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Of what?

734

让我们损失了大量蜜蜂居民

妈妈  等一下
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Mum, wait.

738

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I bet if we asked, Mr. Holmes would... do his thing.

739
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,700
就是只凭观察就推断出别人是谁
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The thing he does where he tells people

740
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,220
以及他们去过哪里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} who they are and where they've been, just from looking.

741
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,400

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Do Mum for her.

743
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:35,060
别拿蠢事打扰福尔摩斯先生

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The soot on your dress attests that you went by train to Portsmouth,

753
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,860

01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:36,220
噢  那不是我的书桌  那是约翰的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Oh, that's not my desk, it's John's.

796
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:39,720
他离开贝克街去成婚了  把书桌留在了那里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He left it at Baker Street when he went off to get married.

797
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,460
是的  它有一个隔层
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Yes, and there's a secret compartment

798
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,540
里面就装著你笔下的那隻手套
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} containing the very glove you've been writing about.

799
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,560
我知道你说过华生医生并不能总是说对
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I know you say Dr. Watson didn't always get things right,

800
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,180
但在那个故事中
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  but in the story...

801
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,220
我不再研究那个故事了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I am not working on that story anymore.

802
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:54,360
我知道  但在华生的故事中  的确有玻璃琴
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}    Yes, but in Watson's story, he does have the armonica in it.

803
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,380
和德国女士以及那个手套
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And the German lady. And that glove.

804
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,800
所以也许他说对了的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} So maybe he did get things right.

805
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,540
不  这不可能
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   No, that's not possible.

806
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,760
约翰那时已经不在贝克街了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} John had gone from Baker Street by then.

807
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,960
那为什麽它会在那里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Well, then why was it in there?

808
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,180
我不知道  就算我曾经知道  我也不记得了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I don't know! And if I ever did know, I don't remember.

809
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,660
如果不记得了 那你为什麽说它并不像
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}If you can't remember, then why couldn't the case have been a success

810
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:13,080
- 华生医生写的那样成功  - 因为这是我最后的案子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} like Dr. Watson wrote it? - Because it was my last case.

811
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,460
如果我最后成功地了结了它
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And if I'd brought it to a successful conclusion,

812
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,120
我就不能逃离我的职业
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I wouldn't have left the profession

813
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:21,740
在与世隔绝的这里度过35年
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and spent 35 years here, in this place, away from the world!

814
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:31,040
我选择被放逐  作为给自己的惩罚  但这是为了什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I chose exile for my punishment, but what was it for?

815
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,100
我肯定是犯了特别可怕的错误
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I must have done something terribly wrong...

816
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:37,180
而我不知道它究竟是什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And I've no evidence of what it was.

817
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,840
只能感受到痛苦  愧疚
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Only pain, guilt...

818
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,280
无用  一无是处
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Useless, worthless feelings!

819
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:49,260
我真希望我从没接手过梅崎的案子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I wish to God I'd never even taken Umezaki's case!

820
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,640
- 凯尔默的  - 什麽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - Kelmot's. - What?

821
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,040
是凯尔默的案子  你刚刚说了梅崎
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Kelmot's case. You said Umezaki.

822
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:04,360
罗杰  茶泡好了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Roger. Tea's ready.

823
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,220
最好把这里收收
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Best clear this up.

824
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,900
福尔摩斯先生  你现在想喝茶吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mr. Holmes. Would you like your tea now?

825
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:41,420
福尔摩斯先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Mr. Holmes?

826
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:49,780
如果你死了  蜜蜂怎麽办
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} If you die... what'll happen to the bees?

827
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,700
我不知道
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I haven't a clue.

828
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:02,080
一个人不可能解决所有问题
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} One can't solve everything.

829
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,920
据说这是用来召唤往生者的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Said to be used  to call for the dead.

830
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,680
死亡  哀悼  悲伤
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Death, mourning, grief...

831
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,080
它们都平淡无奇
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   They're all commonplace.

832
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,400
而逻辑则很罕见
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Logic is rare.

833
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,620
死者并不远
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   The dead are not so very far away.

834
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,220
他们只是在牆的另一面
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} They're just on the other side of the wall.

835
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:03,220
你究竟什麽时候说的这些
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Now, whenever did you say that?

836
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,080
把你的小把戏用在别处吧  福尔摩斯先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Ply your parlour tricks elsewhere, Mr. Holmes.

837
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,620
只要我还为我的丈夫洗衣服
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} My husband could never succeed at deception

838
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,340
他就不可能骗得过我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} so long as I do his laundry.

839
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,520
我不太知道你是做什麽的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I don't know much about your profession,

840
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,120
但我猜测你常常受雇去跟踪女人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} but I doubt predicting the future of women you're engaged to follow

841
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,420
预测她们的未来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} is common practice.

842
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:33,340
这只是为了达到期待结果的一种手段
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   It was intended only as a means to achieve a desired result.

843
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,620
- 这是为了什麽  - 为了拖延你的行动
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - That being what? - To delay your actions.

844
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:39,300
为了不让你去那个急于达成的会面
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} To keep you from this appointment you seem so eager to make.

845
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,540
在我今天瞥见你之前
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Even before I glimpsed you today,

846
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,040
我就察觉到你对你丈夫的强烈情感
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'd gleaned some of the passionate feelings you have for your husband.

847
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,420
他夺走了你深爱的音乐
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The man who took away the music you loved,

848
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:52,240
否定你从课堂中收穫的快乐
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} denied you the pleasures of your lessons,

849
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,800
甚至拒绝为孩子刻墓碑
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} even refused even to mark a child's grave.

850
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,800
所有这些都体现了你深深的厌恶
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} All these predicted your antipathy.

851
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,140
接下来我就看到了你的举动
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And then I witnessed your actions.

852
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,160
假冒他签名
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Forging his signature,

853
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,100
提取他的账户
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   drawing down his account,

854
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,040
购买毒药  咨询他的遗嘱
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   purchasing poison,  consulting his will,

855
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:11,600
计划和一个神秘男子逃跑 而他得到了不菲的报酬
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   planning an escape  with a mystery man who was paid a handsome fee.

856
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,020
在我看来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And all for my benefit.

857
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,540
这一系列有说服力的情况
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} A convincing set of circumstances,

858
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:20,600
表明了你谋杀你丈夫的动机
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} signalling your intention to murder your husband.

859
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:26,260
但有两处破绽
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} But for two errors.

860
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:33,300
首先要怪你的丈夫
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} We must place blame on your husband for the first.

861
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:38,120
如果凯尔默先生没有闯入西莫尔女士的工作室
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} If Mr. Kelmot had not blundered into Madame Schirmer's atelier...

862
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,020
把我从原计划中引开
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  and so taken me from my course,

863
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,840
你就不会在街上閒逛那麽久
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   you wouldn't have had  to loiter on the street

864
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,280
以致于十分可疑
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   for such a suspiciously long  period of time.

865
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,320
但你没有其他选择  只能閒逛
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   But you had no choice,   so loiter you did.

866
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:53,860
我也留意到你身上并没有任何迹象
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I would also make the observation that there is nothing about you

867
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:57,120
表明你是那种逛橱窗只看不买的女人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} that signifies the type of woman who enjoys window shopping,

868
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,000
特别当你所看的是一个动物标本剥制店的橱窗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} especially the window of a taxidermist.

869
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:03,020
这就是第二个错吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Was that the second error?

870
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:05,080
不  这只是第一个错误的证实
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   No, merely confirmation of the first.

871
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:08,860
第二个是无法避免的  也是更确凿的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The second was unavoidable, and all the more damning.

872
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,900
车站的那个男人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The man at the station.

873
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,720
他身上的一切 他的衣服  裤子上的补丁
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Everything about him, his clothes,  the patches on his trousers,

874
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,800
他的双手  满是酸留下的疤痕和灼伤
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   his hands,  scarred and burned with acid,

875
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,360
表明了他的职业
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   announced his profession.

876
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,300
石匠
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Stonemason.

877
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:29,060
金钱肯定是他最急迫需要的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Money must have been a dire necessity,

878
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,940
否则你绝对不会模仿你丈夫的签字
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} else you would never have forged your husband's signature.

879
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,640
这笔钱是为了买墓碑
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The money was to pay for the headstones

880
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,140
这是你丈夫决不允许的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} your husband would not allow.

881
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:40,040
为了格蕾丝和詹姆斯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} For Grace. For James.

882
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:42,920
以及你自己
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} For you.

883
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:49,100
这样安排事情
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Was arranging things to

884
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:52,840
让凯尔默先生看起来像是被蓄意谋杀的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} make it look as if Mr. Kelmot was the intended victim

885
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:55,860
只是为了躲避我的追踪吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} simply to keep me off the trail?

886
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:02,440
当我看到那张卡片时  我太生气了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   When I found the card... I was furious.

887
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,780
因为托马斯竟是那麽不瞭解我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} That Thomas should know me so little

888
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:09,580
以致于需要雇一个侦探来调查真相
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} that he had need to employ a detective to uncover the truth.

889
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,780
然后我就想到了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Then it struck me,

890
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:17,700
如果有人能够瞭解  那个人肯定是你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} if anyone could understand, it would be you.

891
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,460
托马斯觉得我疯了  因为我和我的孩子们讲话
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Thomas thinks I'm mad because I speak to my children.

892
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,160
他不理解
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He doesn't understand.

893
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:31,000
往生者们其实并不远
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The dead are not so very far away.

894
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:34,620
他们只是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} They're just...

895
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,700
在牆的另一边
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} on the other side of the wall.

896
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:44,420
而我们  就在这边  我们所有人都太
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It's us, on this side, who are, all of us so...

897
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,220
孤独
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Alone?

898
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:52,240
我一直都很孤独
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I have been alone...

899
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,240
这辈子都是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} all my life.

900
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,480
但我的思维能力是一种补偿
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} But with the compensations of the intellect.

901
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:04,760
- 这就足够了吗  - 可以说是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - And is that enough? - It can be.

902
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,340
只要他足够幸运能在这世上找到一个地方
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} If one is so fortunate as to find a place in the world.

903
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:17,160
在这里  他的孤独能够和另一个灵魂共处
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And another soul with whom one's loneliness can reside.

904
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:24,500
你知道这样的地方吗  两个灵魂可以住在一起
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Do you know a place where two such souls might reside?

905
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:37,900
这是个我从未接到过的邀请
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   It was an offer  unlike any I had ever received.

906
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:42,160
她想和我分享她的孤独
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   She wanted to share  her solitude with me.

907
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:48,500
之后我才意识到我的决定多麽可怕
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   It was only later I realised how fateful  my decision would be.

908
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,260
你有一个爱你的丈夫
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You have a husband who loves you.

909
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,420
回家找他吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Go home to him.

910
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,240
福尔摩斯先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Mr. Holmes...

911
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:42,880
我感激你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You have my thanks.

912
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,280
女士  我还可以为你做点什麽吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   What more, madam, could I do?

913
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,080
她将瓶子里的东西倒了出来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   She had poured out   the contents of the bottle

914
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,080
并非蓄意地
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   and,  with no malice aforethought,

915
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:17,140
给那个无辜的目击者下了毒
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  poisoned the innocent witness.

916
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,260
如果这是约翰故事中的一个
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   If it had been  one of John's stories,

917
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,460
他会将它称为一个预示
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   he would have called it  a foreshadowing.

918
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,900
我和她共处的时间极为短暂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Our time together was fleeting.

919
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,480
事实上还不满一小时
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Less than an hour, really.

920
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:00,900
但她的死却让我明白人性
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Yet her death made me see that human nature was a mystery

921
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,420
是一个不能仅用逻辑去解释的谜
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   that logic alone could not illuminate.

922
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,980
我曾成功推理出她案件的来龙去脉
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I had successfully deduced the facts of her case,

923
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,440
但我没有领会其中的深意
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   but I had failed to grasp their meaning.

924
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,260
我从没有如此感受到
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Never had I felt

925
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:26,480
心中这样一种无法琢磨的空虚
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   such an incomprehensible emptiness within myself.

926
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,700
那之后我开始明白
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Only then did I begin to understand

927
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:35,140
自己在这世上是多麽孤独
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   how utterly alone I was in the world.

928
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:43,500
哈德森太太写信给华生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Mrs. Hudson wrote to Watson.

929
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:45,220
他立刻就来了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   He came at once.

930
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:50,160
我们一起在曾经的屋子里  度过了一个多月的时光
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   He stayed with me, in our old rooms, for a month more.

931
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:03,720
我将那个案子的所有细节都告诉了他
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I told him about the case, everything in great detail.

932
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,320
他将我从绝望的边缘拉了回来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   He brought me back from the brink.

933
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,960
之后  华生把这个故事写了下来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   And then Watson wrote the story.

934
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,420
他将我描绘成一个英雄
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   He made me the hero.

935
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,740
那是他对我表示善意的方式
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   It was his way of bestowing a kindness.

936
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,520
除此之外他不知道还有什麽方法
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   He knew no other manner

937
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,360
能让他描述出此刻笔下的人物
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   in which to write the character he had created.

938
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:31,120
经过了这麽多年  约翰依旧不瞭解我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   After all those years, John didn't know me at all.

939
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:34,160
为什麽他会把手套收起来  我只能靠猜了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Why he took the glove I can only surmise,

940
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,240
是不是担心它会勾起我的回忆
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   was it to prevent it becoming  too powerful a reminder,

941
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,880
担心它成为一口悲伤之井
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   to keep it from being  a well of sadness

942
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,300
引我重陷悲伤
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   to which I might return?

943
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:46,780
但他也没办法毁了它
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  But he could not bring himself to destroy it either.

944
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:49,720
在那之后  约翰和我渐渐疏远了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   After that,  John and I were estranged.

945
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,120
三年后  他也离开了人世
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Three years later,  he too was gone,

946
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:55,920
我们都不曾互相道别
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   without us ever having said goodbye.

947
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:14,200
这也是故事的真实结局
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   And thus concludes  the true story

948
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:16,800
女人不终天年
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   of a woman  who died before her time,

949
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:19,040
而男人  直到最近
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  and a man who, until recently,

950
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:22,360
才寿终正寝
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   was certain  he had outlived his.

951
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,160
罗杰又去看蜜蜂了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Roger with the bees?

952
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:34,860
很可能是的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Like as not.

953
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:37,000
我有些重要的事情要交代他
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Must tell him something important.

954
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,880
你继续忙你的吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You continue with whatever it was you were doing.

955
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:45,540
你问问他把洒水壶放哪儿去了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  You might ask him where the watering can's got to!

956
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,820
救护车吗  对  这里是海德里庄园
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Ambulance? Yes, this is Headly House.

957
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:45,340
- 海德里  - 对  麻烦快点
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   - Headly?   - Yes, quickly!

958
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,380
请带点肾上腺素液过来
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And bring some supplies of adrenaline.

959
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:49,640
- 海德里庄园  - 对  海德里
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} -  Headly House?   - That's right, Headly!

960
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:19,400
罗杰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Roger?

961
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:21,920
罗杰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Roger!

962
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:24,160
罗杰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Roger?

963
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:30,060
噢  罗杰  噢  不 不不不不不不
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Oh, Roger. Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no!

964
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,760
罗杰  噢  罗杰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Roger. Oh, Roger!

965
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:56,600
福尔摩斯先生吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Mr. Holmes?

966
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:00,700
我是吉尔伯特探长
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It's Inspector Gilbert.

967
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,440
福尔摩斯先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mr. Holmes?

968
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,300
我在这  探长
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  Yes, Inspector?

969
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,120
他们正在给那个男孩注射肾上腺素
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   They're giving the boy injections of adrenaline,

970
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:15,600
就像您说的那样  但是
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} as you said to, but...

971
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,380
他并不见转好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} he's not looking good.

972
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,260
他当时正在躲那些蜜蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   He was fleeing his attackers.

973
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,100
从他的脚印来看
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} His footprints.

974
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:30,060
看得出他当时非常惊慌失措
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Their pattern shows that his flight was disorientated.

975
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,380
蜂群肯定一直追著他叮咬
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The must have followed him in their attack.

976
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,260
而在他失去意识之前
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And before he lost consciousness,

977
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,820
他的皮肤一定出现过潮红
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} his skin would have flushed,

978
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,480
同时伴随著灼痛感
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} accompanied by burning pain...

979
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:42,220
血压迅速下降  导致虚弱
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} A drop in blood pressure, weakness.

980
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:45,840
他的喉咙和嘴巴也会红肿
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} His throat and mouth would be swollen

981
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:48,080
这也是为什麽他无法呼救
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} which explains why he didn't call for help.

982
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,400
然后心率下降
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Then a drop in heart rate...

983
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:55,000
呼吸困难
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Inability to breathe...

984
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:58,400
陷入休克
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Shock.

985
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,160
您知道他对蜜蜂过敏吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Did you know he was allergic to bees?

986
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:10,380
我确定他不会
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  I was certain he wasn't.

987
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:35,900
不  不  门罗夫人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} No, no! No, Mrs. Munro, no!

988
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,780
你不能那样做
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You mustn't do that!

989
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:42,300
我的儿子  醒不过来了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   My son... won't wake.

990
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:46,080
他可能永远也不会醒来了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He may never wake.

991
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,160
他们在早上之前一直把我支开
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} They sent me away till morning.

992
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,480
你甚至都没有打算
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You didn't even have the decency

993
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,020
告诉我他究竟怎麽了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} to tell me what'd happened to him!

994
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:56,720
我不觉得这能有什麽帮助
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  I didn't think it would make a difference.

995
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,300
我是他的母亲
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I'm his mother!

996
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:01,260
我是他的母亲
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'm his mother...

997
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:04,660
你把他从我身边偷走了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And you stole him from me!

998
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:05,940
他是我的全部
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He's all I had!

999
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,240
现在我失去他了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And I've lost him now.

1000
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,600
为什麽承受这一切的不是你
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Why wasn't it you they did it to?

1001
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:15,720
- 这都该由你承受  - 这不是那些蜜蜂的错
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  It should've been you!  - The bees were not to blame.

1002
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,180
你只在乎那些蜜蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} They're all you care about!

1003
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,180
不  我在乎的是罗杰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  No! I care about Roger.

1004
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,960
我非常在乎他
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I care about him very much.

1005
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:37,380
我养的那些蜜蜂  并没有蛰他
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The bees... didn't do it.

1006
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,420
不是那些蜜蜂的错
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} The bees were not to blame.

1007
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:52,420
蛰他的是黄蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} It was the wasps!

1008
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:55,960
罗杰试著弄清楚谁杀死了那些蜜蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Roger was trying to find out what was killing the bees.

1009
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:58,540
于是他就到处找  他找到了黄蜂的巢
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And he did. He found the wasps' nest.

1010
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:00,560
他想要阻止它们捕杀蜜蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He had to stop them wiping out the bees.

1011
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:03,580
所以他可能做了最糟糕的事情
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And so he did the worst possible thing.

1012
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:06,640
他想用洒水壶浇那些黄蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He tried to drown them with water from his can.

1013
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:08,770
你怎麽知道是黄蜂蛰的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   How do you know it was them?

1014
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,240
蜜蜂蛰人的时候会射出刺  而黄蜂不会
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Bees leave their stings. Wasps don't.

1015
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:14,600
罗杰的脸上没有刺
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} There were no stings left in Roger's face.

1016
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,680
当他们发起攻击的时候  他用洒水壶朝它们洒水
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And when they attacked, he dropped the watering can

1017
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,170
然后跑去保护那些蜜蜂
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and ran up to protect the bees.

1018
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:21,700
他的脚印显示他从蜂房到了黄蜂巢  然后又回到了蜂房
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} There are his footprints from the apiary to the nest and back.

1019
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:25,300
- 他想救那些蜜蜂  - 是的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - He was trying to save the bees.  - Yes.

1020
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:28,400
是的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Yes.

1021
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:13,020
从前  有一个女人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} There was a woman, once.

1022
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,020
我认识她不到一天
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I knew her less than a day.

1023
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:18,060
只聊过一刻钟的天
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} A quarter of an hour's conversation.

1024
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:21,920
她需要我的帮助
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} She needed my help.

1025
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,660
她是如此渴望被人理解
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} She needed so desperately to be understood by someone...

1026
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:28,960
被我理解
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Me.

1027
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:34,060
所以我仔细研究了她那个案件的细节
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} So, I laid out the particulars of her case as I saw them...

1028
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,220
我想是为了取悦她
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} To her satisfaction, I thought.

1029
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:39,260
我看著她离开
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I watched her walk away.

1030
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:43,000
几个小时之后  她结束了自己的生命
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And within hours she'd ended her life.

1031
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:49,080
为了搞清楚她为何如此绝望
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} By identifying the cause of her despair with such clarity,

1032
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:52,780
我曾经给了她一份她想要的全权委託书
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'd given her carte blanche to do just as she intended.

1033
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:58,200
我当时应该倾我所能救她的命的
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I should've done whatever it took to save her.

1034
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:02,000
当时我应该骗她  编造一个故事
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Lie to her, make up a story.

1035
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:07,060
当她哭泣的时候陪在她身边
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Take her by the hand and hold her as she wept,

1036
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:09,580
跟她说  来跟我一起住吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} and said, "Come live with me.

1037
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,660
让我们两个人一起孤独吧
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Let us be alone together."

1038
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,720
但我当时很害怕
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} But I was fearful.

1039
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:25,160
也很自私
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Selfish.

1040
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,260
她是我
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} She's the reason...

1041
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,380
到这里来养蜜蜂的原因
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I came here to my bees,

1042
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,240
正因那样  我不能再伤害任何一个人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} so that I couldn't harm anyone ever again.

1043
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,300
我会搬出去住
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} I'm leaving you the house.

1044
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:47,920
离开你  还有罗杰
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} You and Roger.

1045
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:55,000
房子  土地  蜂房  这里的一切一切
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} House, grounds, apiary, everything within and without.

1046
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,900
我心意已决
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} And as I shan't change my mind

1047
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,600
我相信你会理解  这样的话
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} on this point, you will see, I trust,

1048
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:02,780
一切都会简单许多
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} that it will be greatly less complicated for all concerned

1049
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:06,580
只要你们俩不要去
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} if the two of you don't go off to...

1050
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:09,580
某些地方  比如  朴茨茅斯
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} ... somewhere like... Portsmouth.

1051
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,880
门夫人
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Mrs. Munro?

1052
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:16,800
罗杰醒了
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Roger's awake.

1053
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,820
尊敬的梅崎先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Dear Mr.Umezaki,

1054
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,740

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I write to tell you that I have at last

1055
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:09,080
回想起与你父亲的会面
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   recalled my meeting  with your father.

1056
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:15,160
有个女人  因为没能帮她侦破案件而死
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   A woman had died because I failed to solve her case.

1057
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,040
我的心中满是罪恶感与愧疚
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Guilt and recrimination  having taken their toll on me,

1058
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:23,000
因为我远远没有人们想像的那麽厉害
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   my powers  were far from at their best

1059
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,740
当我收到一封加急信
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   when I received  an urgent message

1060
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:28,160
通知我去第欧根尼俱乐部
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   summoning me to the Diogenes Club

1061

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   to meet  with my brother Mycroft.

1062

这位先生想要提供服务
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}  This gentleman has made an offer of service.

1063
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:37,780
他希望能为国王效力
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He wishes to work for the Crown.

1064

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I'm here to be tested, Mr. Holmes.

1065

1066
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,040
您觉得我合适吗
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Do you think that I am suited?

1067
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:48,600
当然了  先生
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   I'm sure, sir.

1068
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:52,100
很好  还有一件小事情要说
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Good. There is one minor issue.

1069
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:55,240
梅崎先生已在日本成家  还有了一个孩子
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} Mr. Umezaki has a wife and child in Japan.

1070
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:58,120
他想知道让孩子修什麽课程好
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} He wonders what would be the best course.

1071
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:11,360
写一封信告诉他  你打算继续留在伦敦
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   Write a letter saying you plan to stay on in England.

1074

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10}   in absolute secrecy and with the greatest distinction,

1075

一直到阿拉伯海

1078

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs10} - The queen runs the colony.  - Mm-hmm.

1101
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,440
雄蜂为蜂后效力
