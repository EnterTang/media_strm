37
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:05,690
The phone has been ringing
for like two hours.

38
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:06,952
And I'm working.

39
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,606
Yeah, answering
the phone is working.

00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,000
CHUCK: Chill out, Mr. I'm
Going Off the Grid for a While.

41
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:12,741
What, you lasted like two days?

42
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:15,700
SAM: Yeah, well, things haven't
worked out quite as I planned.

43
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:18,312
Being responsible for
an entire summer camp,

44
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,052
what could possibly go wrong?

45
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,706
SAM: Oh, you have no idea.

46
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,144
No, actually, you might
have the exact idea, which

47
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,494
is why I'm calling you,
'cause everything started out

48
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:29,236
so great, and now there's
this crazed killer

49
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,019
roaming the campground.

00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:33,065
[tense music]

51
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:34,241
Wait, really?

52
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:35,981
Yes, Chuck, really.

53
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:39,115
Everyone is dead,
or almost everyone.

54
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,377
Whoa.

55
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:42,205
Damn.

56
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:45,600
I mean, that sometimes happens,
especially the camp counselors.

57
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:46,601
But I just never thought--

58
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:47,776
SAM: I know, I know.

59
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,212
It's terrible.

60
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,475
It really is terrible,
and I'm really scared.

61
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,216
So I thought maybe
you can help me

62
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,177
out, give me some king of advice
so I'm not, you know, dying.

63
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,482
Oh, OK.

64
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:00,528
Uh, yeah, well, first
of all, your phone

65
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,225
seems to be working fine.

66
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,661
Wouldn't you rather
call the cops?

67
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:04,532
I did.

68
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:05,402
I called the sheriff.

69
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:06,403
I left a voicemail.

70
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:07,839
Wait, a voicemail?

71
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:08,840
SAM: Yeah, a voicemail.

72
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,146
I mean, he's 76.

73
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,756
He doesn't really
work nights anymore,

74
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,064
and-- and given that and the
town being 25 miles away,

75
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:17,893
I mean, I don't think anyone's
getting here before I'm dead.

76
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:19,764
How far off the
grid did you go?

77
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:20,939
Far.

78
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,419
25 miles.

79
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:24,204
Ah, gotcha.

80
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:28,164
All right, well-- well, first,
I got to ask how many so far.

81
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,253
Uh, what-- what do you mean?

82
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:31,123
Like, body count.

83
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:31,950
How many dead?

84
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:34,214
Oh, uh, I don't know.

85
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,084
I don't know, you know.

86
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,433
I'm a little flustered.

87
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:37,913
Counting's not, like,
my thing right now.

88
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:39,871
How did this even start?

89
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:42,439
I'm not sure.

90
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:44,528
All I remember is that
everything started out so

91
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:46,095
great when we first got here.

92
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:49,446

Step right up.

96
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,957
And I designed the
logo myself this year.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,175
I think they're pretty cool.
Hm?

00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:24,307
What do you think, Carol?
Yeah?

99
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:24,873
OK.

100

Yeah?

101
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:26,222
It's all right.

Hey, Ted.

103
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,312
Hey, thank you for choosing
Clear Vista this year.

Good to be back.

111
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:40,802
Here you go.

112
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,325
One thing, and
it's not a big deal.

113
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:46,111
It's not a big deal, but,
um, they're canoes, so--

114
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:47,287
don't even worry about it.

115
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,157
It's fine.

116
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,332
Yeah, not a big deal.

117
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:50,420
What's up, Sam?

118
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:51,291
SAM: Hey.

119
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:51,987

120
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,683
DREW: Yeah.

121
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:53,380
Find you one.

There you are.

DREW: I'm totally ready to
just unplug from the world

124
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:56,774
and catch a vibe
with this place.

Super peaceful.

128
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:02,432
That's the spirit.

129
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,912
You guys hear that?

132
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:18,361
Imani's there?

133
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:21,146
Well, I mean, I couldn't not
hire her because she dumped me.

134
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,539
That's discrimination.

135
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,454
Oh, god.

136
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:25,760
Hi, Imani.

137
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:27,327
I don't wanna be
a whiny bitch, but--

138
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,678
Oh, might wanna just
leave it there then.

139
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,070
SAM: Thank you, Freddie.
STEVE: Here you go.

140
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:33,115
COUNSELOR: Thanks.

141
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:34,812
Is this unplugging necessary?

142
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:37,380
Nature is our nature.
Come on.

143
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:39,469
It's going to be a fun awesome--
- OK, whatever.

Here you go.

146
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:46,694
If you're look for other
ways to stimulate yourself,

147
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:47,956
just you let me know.

148
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,310
OK.
Here you are.

149
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,705
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Brad.

150
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:01,317
Guess I'll have to give that
harassment speech after all.

151
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,451
Look, guys, when the kids get
here, it's really hard work.

152
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:08,455
So you're going to want to
appreciate every moment.

153
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:11,414
[light music]

154
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,894
Yeah.

155
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:14,286
Uh, being in nature?

156
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:19,291
Huh?

157
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:20,205
That's what you are saying.

158
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:20,945
You know?

159
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,294
SAM: Oh, right.

160
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:23,295
JAMIE: Commune with nature.
SAM: Right.

161
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:24,209
Thank you.

162
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:26,037
That's what, uh-- exactly.

163
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:27,778
Jamie, right?

164
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:29,519
You gotta give these kids the
best summer they've ever had.

165
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:32,435
[tense music]

166
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,349
Wait, hold on a second.

167
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:41,444
OK.

168
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:43,968
So of the group,
who's dead so far?

169
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:45,056
SAM: OK, I wanna
say all of them,

170
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,015
but definitely most of them.

171
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:49,626
And-- and when we say
dead, you mean killed.

172
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,845
Yeah.

173
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,977
Stabbed, mutilated,
ripped apart.

174
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,414
And now he's hunting me.

175
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,937
Oh, and you've seen him?

176
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,982
SAM: Oh, yeah, freaky
looking dude, really scary.

177
00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:58,983
Ugly, ugly.

178
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:00,463
I mean, hideously ugly dude.

179
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:04,859
Like Freddy ugly
or Matt Cordell ugly?

180
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:06,338
Uh.

181
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:08,166
Maniac Cop.

182
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,516
I'm just gonna say ugly.

sure it's a dude?

184

it always a dude?

185
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,521
Aw, just ask Jason's mother.

[ominous music]

189
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,140
Oh my god.

190
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,620
I think he's found me.

191
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,143
Oh my god.

192
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:29,187
Chuck.

193
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:30,493
Got your Serial Slasher card?

194
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:31,320
SAM: Oh, god.

195
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:31,886
[voices whispering]

196
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:32,843
Oh.

VOICES: [WHISPERING] Kill.

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,283
CUSTOMER 2: Because that's
like the classic bag that you--

00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:40,634
[voices whispering]

202
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,418
Chuck, do you hear that?

203
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,593
Hear what?

204
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:44,768
Voices, voices.

205
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,553
The store is
full of customers.

206
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:48,032
I hear tons of voices.

207
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,339
No, no, no, not them.

208
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,646
[liquid splashing]

209
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:56,214
Gas.

210
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:59,609
I smell gasoline.

211
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:00,610
CHUCK: Gas?

212
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:02,133
Sam, what is going on there?

213
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:03,004
[lighter flicks]

00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:03,700
[intense dramatic music]

00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,136
SAM: Oh my god.

216
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,573
Oh.

217
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,096
Oh, shit.

218
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:09,097
Oh, shit.
- Sam?

219
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,924

[phone disconnects]

221
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,013
Hello?

222
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:12,666
Sam?

223
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:13,405
Oh my god.

Oh, shit.

231
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,668
OK.

[phone buzzes, ring tone plays]

233
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:19,167
[phone ringing]

234
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:23,258
What?

235
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:24,433
Sam.

236
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:25,826
You almost gave
me a heart attack

237
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:27,175
hanging up on me like that.

238
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:29,090
You gave me a heart
attack blowing up

239
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:31,048
my phone for everyone
in this camp to hear.

240
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:34,138
CHUCK: Well, OK-- well, in the
spirit of offering you advice,

241
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:37,577
I'd suggest maybe
silencing your phone.

242
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,927
You don't think I already
thought to silence my--

243
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,754
[phone buzzes]

244
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:41,798
CHUCK: OK, look.

245
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:43,234
I had a thought.

246
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,976
OK, you said this crazed
killer is a guy, right?

247
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,327
OK, so maybe we should talk
about the guys out there,

248
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:50,677
you know?

249
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,504
See if we can figure
out who this asshole is.

250
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:54,985
How does knowing who
it is help me not die?

251
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,335
Well, I think figuring
out what they want

252
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,989
could help you not die.

253
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,512
Smart.

254
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:02,384
Like, is it an old camper
who got teased as a kid

255
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:03,603
and is back for blood?

256
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:04,734
No.

257
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,344
Or is it a parent
who's looking

258
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:09,434
for revenge after a counselor
let their kid drown?

259
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,175
Jesus, I hope not, no.

260
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:14,744
Or does one of the counselors
have a formerly conjoined twin?

261
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,093
What movie is that from?

262
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:17,442
That could be a huge problem.

263
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:18,792
No, it's nothing
like that, Chuck, OK?

264
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,184
It's-- it's nothing
like that, I promise.

265
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:20,881
OK?

266
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,013
OK.

267
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,275
OK, let me think.

268
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:26,103
Um.

269
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,671
Oh, you mentioned
some guy named Steve.

270
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:29,585
Yeah.

271
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,719
Steve, the Kayak King.

272
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:33,633
But it's not him.

273
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:36,679
[heavy dramatic music]

274
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:39,160
[imani coughs]

275
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,901
Oh my god.

276
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:44,165
Steve, the Kayak King.

277
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,430
He's up shit's creek now, and
I'd say without a paddle, but--

278
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:49,823
JAMIE: Who does this?

279
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,041
What kind of psycho?

280
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:00,921
Holy shit.

281
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:01,835
Is that Ted?

282
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:02,618
JAMIE: It's Steve.

283
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,228
The Kayak King.

284
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:05,665
IMANI: Guys, he
isn't the only one.

285
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,884
We found Bob and Carol's
bodies in the kitchen.

286
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:08,972
Ted and Alice are missing.

287
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,017
So is Drew.

288
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,148
BRAD: Who's Drew?

289
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:12,541
[inaudible] from the city.

290
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:13,411
JAMIE: Missing.

291
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:14,630
Not necessarily dead.

292
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,631
FREDDIE: So you're an optimist.

293
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,676
NANCY: Wait.

294
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:17,938
What if one of them did this?

295
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:20,331
JAMIE: This is insane.

296
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,376
We have to do something.

297
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,552
Sam, what do we do?

298
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:24,901
Oh.

299
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,381
IMANI: What?

300
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,252
Well, we all gotta--

301
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:29,427
OK, we all need to--

302
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:30,037
[gags]

303
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,041
We all just need to--

304
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,651
we really gotta--

305
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,784
Put an end to this [inaudible]
bullshit, get our cell

306
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:40,787
phones and call the police.

307
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,616
[tense music]

308
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,443
SAM: What the hell?

309
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:46,836
No.

310
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,185
No, no, no, no.

311
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:49,360
FREDDIE: Somebody
better explain quick.

312
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,144
IMANI: Sam, where
are the phones?

313
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,014
It's impossible.

314
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:51,711
I put them all in here.

315
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:52,755
I locked it.

316
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,800
No one knows the combo but me.

317
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:55,149
You mean your birthday?

318
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:58,065
Hey.

319
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:01,459
[tense music]

00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:12,296
[engine struggles]

321
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:14,385
Come on!

322
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,344
What the hell's going on?

323
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:18,738
[engine hissing]

324
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,785
NANCY: That's bad.

325
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,091
Right?

326
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:25,570
BRAD: What now, Sam?

327
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,659
Are there any other
vehicles on the property?

328
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,749
No, no, this was it.

329
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:30,793
Great.

330
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,229
Looks like we're walking.

331
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:33,448
No, no, no, I--

332
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,405
I don't think
that's a good idea.

333
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,885
I mean, guys, look around.

334
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,192
There's swamp and marshland
in every direction.

335
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,802
A town's not for 25 miles.

336
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:40,803
BRAD: OK, so we hump it.

337
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,196
We can take that.

338
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,111
Maybe when the sun
comes up, but not now.

339
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:46,069
There's snakes and
gators out there--

340
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:48,245
poisonous snakes, giant gators.

341
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:49,812
Great.

342
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,335
So we get sliced up by a
madman or eaten by reptiles.

343
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,467
FREDDIE: Did you see Steve?

344
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,816
I vote reptiles.

345
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,426
HEATHER: There's gotta
be a third choice.

346
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,515
JAMIE: What if we hole up
in the cabins until morning?

347
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,649
Yeah, 'cause those old
ass cabins are super secure.

348
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:01,824
No, no, no.

349
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,260
Jamie, that's a good
idea, all right?

350
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:04,131
We can find an area, and
we can make it as safe

351
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,132
and secure as possible.

352
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:06,263
No, Sam, no.

353
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:07,438
Look, that's not enough.

354
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:08,526
I wanna take the
fight to this guy.

355
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,137
SAM: Uh, fair enough, OK?

356
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,834
We'll-- we'll divided
into teams, OK?

357
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:14,619
Half of us on defense to make
a safe place, the other half

358
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:15,751
of us on offense.

359
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,839
We'll set up traps.

360
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,362
We'll take it to this guy.

361
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:19,363
Huh?

362
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:22,758
[tense dramatic music]

363
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:56,096
[ominous music]

364
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,140
Wait, wait wait.

365
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,055
You went patrolling by yourself?

366
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,710
SAM: Well, it's pretty logical
in the heat of the moment.

367
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:02,885
Ugh, yeah.

368
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:04,626
OK, that's fair and
all, but it also

369
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:05,932
means you get killed quicker.

370
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,150
SAM: Can we just
move on, please?

371
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:12,982
FREDDIE: Come on.

372
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:15,245
NANCY: I don't think
this is a good idea.

373
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,856
FREDDIE: Why, 'cause
Sam didn't say so?

374
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:17,987
NANCY: Yeah, kinda.

375
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,554
FREDDIE: Look.

376
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:22,513
They're trying to fight
a maniac with toothpicks

377
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:24,864
and pots and pans.

378
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,866
All right, if I'm gonna
die, I'm gonna die trying.

379
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,606
NANCY: Yeah, die running.

380
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,608
Come on, man, that's
what you're saying.

381
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:33,002
Good people don't run
away from a fight.

382
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:34,699
And guess what, Nancy?

383
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:36,701
You're not not gonna be good
for anything if you're dead.

384
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,181
Hey, what's going on, guys?

385
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:39,879
NANCY: Sam already said
it's too dark out there

386
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:40,531
for us to go out.

387
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:41,315
Sam.

388
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:42,838
Right, yeah, Sam.

389
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,491
NANCY: Plus, I don't wanna
just desert everyone.

390
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:44,492
Deserting?

391
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:45,493
Whoa, you guys, I told you--

392
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:46,668
We're not deserting anyone.

393
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,235
All right, you're
saving yourself.

394
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:48,931
SAM: --there's swap and
marshland in every direction,

395
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:49,540
poisonous--

396
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:50,933
[ringing]

397
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:51,934
FREDDIE: You know what?

398
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:52,804
I don't have time for this.

399
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:54,415
I'm getting out of here.

400
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,853
[heavy dramatic music]

401
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,506
[freddie grunts]

402
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:02,336
Holy shit!

403
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:03,772
[nancy gasps]

404
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,819
Nancy, run!

405
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:09,821
Ah, Jesus!

406
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,171
[gurgling]

407
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:13,695
[sam shouts]

408
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:23,400
It was beyond traumatic.

409
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:24,880
And that's it?

410
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,099
Yeah, yeah.

411
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:27,535
Horrifying.

412
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:28,971
But why didn't he kill you?

413
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:29,711
I don't know.

414
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:30,712
You know, I--

415
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:31,582
I don't-- I just don't know.

416
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:32,409
Well, think about it.

417
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:33,758
Why?

418
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:37,762
Why-- why did he
kill Freddie or Nancy

419
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,155
or Steve or any of the others?

420
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,504
Why-- why does it even matter?

421
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:43,159
OK, here's a different
question for you.

422
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:44,552
Are you covered in blood?

423
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,293
SAM: Chuck, are you
even listening to me?

424
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,121
Just answer the question, Sam.

425
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,340
No.

426
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:53,213
Uh, um, a little.

427
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:54,736
Why?

428
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,173
So if you were just a
witness to these murders,

429
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,219
then how come you're
covered in blood?

430
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:00,002
SAM: You know, I don't--

431
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,612
I just don't know.

432
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,484
I'm, uh, helping my niece
with her creative writing

433
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:04,876
assignment.

434
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,575
Man, the crap education
kids get this days.

435
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:08,706
Whose blood is it?

436
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,838
SAM: What do you mean?

437
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,144
Well, is it your blood?

438
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:13,102
How-- how-- how would
I be able to tell?

439
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:15,583
CHUCK: Well, are you bleeding?

440
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,584
Uh, no, I don't--

441
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:17,280
I don't-- I don't think so.

442
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:18,760
No.

443
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,675
If you were just a
witness to these murders,

444
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:22,546
why are you covered in blood?

445
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,592
Because I was a close witness.

446
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,897
I mean, I was--

447
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,030
I was, like, a very
hands-on witness.

448
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:30,163
I was really, like, right there.

449
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:30,641
OK, what else?

450
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,257
Are you holding a
weapon of any kind?

451
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,345
Probably a sharp one?

452
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:39,389
No, no.

453
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,609
I mean, just this baseball bat.

454
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:43,393
Wait.

455
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,047
I mean, a knife.

456
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:45,874
Sort of.

457
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:46,701
Sort of knife?

458
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:47,876
Well, I don't know.

459
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,877
Would you consider
this a weapon?

460
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,487
CHUCK: In this context, yes.

461
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:52,228
But you could have
had it because you

462
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:53,838
were protecting yourself.

463
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,275
Where did you get it?

464
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:56,624
SAM: I don't know.

465
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:57,886
You really don't know?

466
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,279
No, I don't know.

467
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:00,497
I mean, I thought I was
holding a baseball bat,

468
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,847
but now I have a
really weird knife.

469
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:04,806
CHUCK: Weird how?

470
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,112
I don't know.

471
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:08,070
I mean, it's like
made of like jawbone,

472
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,377
like the serrations are teeth.

473
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,336
[chuckles] It's got like
a real sacrificial vibe.

474
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,164
And I don't know, it's
hard to place the era.

475
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:19,168
Like the knife that you
described the killer carrying?

476
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:23,477
Yes.

477
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,262
Sam.

478
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:27,220
OK.

479
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,004
Look.

480
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:34,357
I hate to ask you this, but are
you sure you're not the killer?

481
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:39,971
I can't be 100% sure.

482
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:45,673
Maybe this is like a Jacob's
Ladder kind of thing,

483
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:47,544
and I'm already dead,
and none of this is real.

484
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:49,851
CHUCK: Well, that's not
possible because I'm here

485
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:51,635
and I'm very much alive.

486
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,854
SAM: Damn it.

487
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,899
Not that, you
know, you're alive.

488
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,031
But, uh, you know what I mean.

489
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,598
OK, look.

490
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:00,166
I mean, you're-- you're
definitely not the killer type.

491
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,645
You know, this is just not you.

492
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,213
Maybe you're like out of
your mind or something.

493
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:05,432
Did somebody drug you?

494
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,129
Uh, no, I don't think so.

495
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,131
Well, and you keep
saying that the killer's

496
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:13,875
like hideously ugly, and
you are definitely not that.

497
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,703
- Aw.
- Wait.

498
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:20,534
Are you wearing a mask?

499
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:22,188
SAM: No.

500
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:23,145
Are you sure?

501
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,669
SAM: Um.

502
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:26,540
I'm pretty sure.

503
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,802
Damn.

504
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:30,457
That would've
explained everything.

505
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,155
'Cause, like, if you're
physically killing somebody

506
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,070
but that's not
really you, then this

507
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,594
could've been the case where
the consciousness of the killer

508
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:43,905
was like possessed by an
object, like an evil mask.

I'm the killer.

Oh my god.

529
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,484
What am I gonna do?

530
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:11,008
You didn't realize
you were murdering him?

531
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:12,619
Stabbing, tying him up?

532
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:14,273
SAM: No.

533
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:17,406
I just remember standing in
front of him already dead.

534
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,321
Well, what did you
think you were doing?

535
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,670
SAM: I don't know.

536
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:24,935
Talking to you now, it's
coming more into focus.

537
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:27,242
Honestly, I don't think
I was thinking anything

538
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,809
until the mask came off.

539
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:31,681
You really didn't know that
you were murdering Steve?

540
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,509
No, no.

541
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:35,424
I was staring at him like
you'd stare at anyone

542
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:38,253
you found diced up and
dead hanging from a tree.

543
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,602
It was just horrible.

544
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:41,561
But you know now that
it was you doing it.

545
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:45,042
SAM: [sighs] I saw
what the mask saw.

546
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:47,088
You forcing me to
remember everything

547
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:50,526
is bringing up stuff that I
didn't even know was there.

548
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,223
It's kinda freaking me out.

549
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,616
So, yeah.

550
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,358
I'm pretty sure it was me.

551
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:59,230
I'm sorry I dragged
you into this, Chuck.

552
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:00,014
No.

553
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:01,363
Don't apologize.

554
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:03,234
You know I live for
this kind of thing.

555
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:04,758
Look.

556
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:06,499
I found some reference
books, some really old stuff

557
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:09,023
that-- that we had in the
storage room in storage,

558
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,633
stuff that never sold.

559
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:13,201
You mean stuff you stashed
away so you could keep it.

560
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:14,376
Maybe.

561
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,247
Um, anyway, I know
that we're going

562
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,902
to get to the bottom of this.

563
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:20,991
So what should I do now?

564
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:22,384
Lock myself away?

565
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,864
I mean, I don't want to
kill any more people.

566
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,213
Is there anyone left to kill?

567
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:26,432
Oh, yeah.

568
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:27,824
Yeah, I mean, there's tons.

569
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:29,957
I mean, you know, I
think-- yes, I think so.

570
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,828
There are people
alive technically,

571
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,047
which is good, and we wanna--

572
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,701
we wanna keep them that way.

573
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:37,007
This conversation's harder
knowing that I'm the killer.

574
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:40,620
What about Imani?

575
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,012
SAM: Oh.

576
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:44,145
Still can't believe
you invited her back.

577
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:44,885
[sighs]

578
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:46,408
How's that going?

579
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,454
You guys cool?

580
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:50,412
Can't we just keep talking
about me killing people?

581
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,022
CHUCK: Well, yeah.

582
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,284
Yeah, I mean-- well, that--
that's where I was going.

583
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:55,069
I-- I was gonna say like, if--

584
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:57,288
if she still cares about you,
you could confide in her,

585
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:59,290
and then maybe she can help you.

586
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:00,030
Yeah.

587
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:00,509
Yeah.

588
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:02,032
Um.

589
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:02,729
OK.

590
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:04,252
I just-- I'm--

591
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:05,471
I'm really not really sure
where she is right now.

592
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:07,777
[dramatic music]

593
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:09,257
OK, I think Imani's dead.

594
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,258
Wait, what?

595
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:11,172
Why didn't you tell me that?

596
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:12,521
I don't know.

597
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:13,479
I just--

598
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,828
Oh, you just remembered.

599
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:15,829
Yes.

600
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,526
Oh, damn it!

601
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:27,667
God, she was-- she
was really something.

602
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,061
[gentle music]

603
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:40,593
STEVE: OK, guys, well--

604
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,899
hold on.

605
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:44,727
OK, guys.

606
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:46,468
OK, I don't think-- here,
can you hold that for me

607
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:47,251
real quick?

608
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,557
It's not working.

609
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,124
Maybe try to get it
to work if you can.

610
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,081
All right, guys, well,
welcome to Camp Clear Vista.

611
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,822
My name is Steve.

612
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:53,997
Some of you know that already
'cause you're in the best cabin

613
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:54,694
ever.

614
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:55,695
My cabin, right?

615
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:58,219
[steve talking in distance]

616
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:02,528
SAM: This is perfect.

617
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:06,096
The camp, the kids,
the counselors.

618
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,229
Yeah, Steve's
really good with kids.

619
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:09,404
And those kayaks.

620
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,927
But these are in fact what?

621
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:11,798
KIDS: Canoes.

622
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:12,799
Great, that's right.

623
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:13,800
I'm glad you guys knew that.

624
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:16,150
SAM: So camp ends on Friday.

625
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,631
What are we going to do then?
- I don't know.

626
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:22,504
You know this is just
a summer fling for me.

627
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:23,462
It's more than that.

628
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,820
What?

629
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:35,212
Oh, come on.

630
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:35,952
Are you worried about
the kids seeing us?

631
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:36,823
No.

632
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:37,737
Have to learn sometime.

633
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:41,741
Then what?

634
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,837
I don't know.
Why can't you just relax?

635
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,664
You know?

636
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:53,187
Have a good time.

637
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,405
And when it's all done,
you'll have a good memory.

638
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:02,022
Just enjoy it.

639
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:04,807
STEVE: Now these are only
to be used to the water, OK?

640
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:06,505
It's not for hitting people, OK?

641
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:09,769
It can also be used for
air guitar or as a golf--

642
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:12,946
you know, like a, um,
club there, OK, guys?

643
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:14,643
But not for hitting,
definitely, OK?

644
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,384
And don't worry if you end up
in the water 'cause we send

645
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:18,255
a scuba diver out
there about a week ago

646
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,910
to check for alligators, and,
uh, he hasn't come back yet,

647
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:22,999
so I think he's doing
a very thorough job.

648
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:25,654
If you see him, you
know, let us know.

649
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:26,655
You know, people were worried.

650
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:29,223
So all right.

651
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,616
Don't look like a sad puppy.

652
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,182
Why do people think I
look like a puppy dog?

653
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:33,923
IMANI: 'Cause you do.

654
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,969
Come here.

655
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:36,839
Come here.

656
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,279
SAM: Whoa, hey!

657
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:43,672
[imani laughs]

658
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:45,065
Oh, no.

659
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,588
How could you?

660
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:48,068
Everybody, we're gonna
play and laugh at Sam, OK?

661
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,373
He just fell in the water there.

662
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,374
[all laugh]

663
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,598
Steve, save me!

664
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:57,991
That's why you wear
the life preservers.

665
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,819
That's why you wear
the life preservers.

666
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:00,820
IMANI: You fell for it.

667
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:01,734
[imani laughs]

668
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:07,087
I'm gonna destroy this thing.

669
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,784
CHUCK: Be very careful
how you do that.

670
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:12,179
[tense music]

671
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:30,980
[voices whispering]

672
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,549
[exclaims]

673
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:37,639
Ow, ow, ow.
Ow.

674
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:38,205
Ow.

675
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:38,858
Ow, ow.

676
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:41,469
CHUCK: Sam.

677
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:42,601
Sam, what's going on?

678
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:48,476
I tried to burn the mask.

679
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,130
CHUCK: Your face is
burning, isn't it?

680
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:51,697
Yeah.

681
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,047
I was worried about that.

682
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,485
I'm afraid the thing
probably imprinted on you.

683
00:26:57,528 --> 00:27:01,097
There's plenty of instances
of that happening in here.

684
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:02,446
How do you know that?

685
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,145
Sam, please, you
called me for a reason.

686
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:07,103
[rustling]

687
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:07,800
Wait.

688
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,584
Shh, shh, shh.

689
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,151
BRAD: Hey.

690
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:12,413
I think I saw that son of
a bitch heading this way.

691
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,763
HEATHER: Do we really
wanna find him?

692
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:17,723
BRAD: When I catch this guy, I'm
gonna beat him till he's dead.

693
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:18,811
Then revive him
so I can chop him

694
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:20,595
up into little bitty pieces.

695
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,554
[tense music]

696
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:24,555
They're on to me.

697
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,687
They're coming after me.

698
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:26,601
CHUCK: Who?

699
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,907
Whoever's still alive.

700
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,430
CHUCK: How do they
know you're the killer?

701
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:30,561
They tried to burn the
cabin down with me in it.

702
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:31,911
That's a pretty
goddamn good clue.

703
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,173
HEATHER: This doesn't
make any sense.

704
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:34,000
Why would Sam do this?

705
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:35,262
BRAD: I don't care.

706
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:36,959
I just want him dead.

707
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:38,613
CHUCK: What about
giving yourself up?

708
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,397
Like, explain the situation.

709
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:44,053
Maybe they can restrain you so
you don't kill anybody else.

710
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:45,098
Brad would kill me.

711
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:46,360
He'd ripped my head off, Chuck.

712
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:47,883
I'm trying to stay alive.

713
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:51,234
[suspenseful music]

714
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,065
[sam panting, whimpering]

715
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:03,420
CHUCK: OK, where are you now?

716
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:04,247
Still hiding.

717
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:04,944
Hold on.

718
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:08,121
[tense music]

719
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:38,194
[sam exclaims]

720
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:39,326
Yeah, OK, I think I'm--

721
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:40,370
I think I'm good for now.

722
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:40,980
OK.

723
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:41,720
OK, good.

724
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,373
All right.

725
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:47,595
So just-- just stay where you
are and-- and hunker down.

726
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:48,901
OK.

727
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:49,336
Um.

728
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:02,697
OK, I'm hunkered.

729
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,046
CHUCK: OK, good.

730
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,918
I think we just need
to regroup and focus.

731
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:06,701
Yeah.
Right.

732
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,833
OK.

733
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,051
CHUCK: And-- and
maybe we can come

734
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:11,271
up with like a
timeline of exactly

735
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:13,186
what you did with the mask on.

736
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:13,882
OK.

737
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:15,318
OK.
Yeah.

738
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,016
CHUCK: OK, what is your
first memory of things

739
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,670
going wrong or going weird?

740
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:22,848
OK, I remember being confused
as to why I was running.

741
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:23,979
Running.

742
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:24,806
Running where?

743
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,460
Uh.

744
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:28,375
Away from a dead tree.

745
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:30,290
CHUCK: Huh?

746
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,900
Yeah.

747
00:29:31,944 --> 00:29:33,554
I-- I remember something bad
happened near a dead tree,

748
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:35,077
and--

749
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,078
What?

750
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:37,601
Oh, shit.

751
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,429
Oh, it's right
there, and I just--

752
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:41,083
I can't remember.

753
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,128
Shit.

754
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:42,781
CHUCK: OK, what do you remember?

755
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:47,481
I remember a pool.

766
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:55,418

everybody around

777
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:45,991
here, get them to all come in
here and get to the good stuff

778
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,644
before us?

779
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:48,994
Come on, they're all out
looking for that grave thing

780
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:50,430
anyway.

782
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:53,346
So help me out, huh?

783
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:59,134
Oh, yes.
Jackpot.

Eh?

785
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:05,184

00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,019
I hate myself.

794
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:59,716
CHUCK: Well, is it too
obvious to ask why didn't

795
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,414
you just take the mask off?

796
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:03,111
When it's on, I don't want to.

797
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:04,243
Oh, yeah.

798
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:05,418
Shoulda figured.

799
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,028
SAM: But this kill
was different.

800
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,812
I think it pushed
me a little too far.

801
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:13,252

So how many do you
think you've killed?

know what I think?

831
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,763
This asshole should
kill himself.

00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:16,331
How long have
you been listening?

833
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,854
Long enough.

834
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:20,335
You should choose your
friends more wisely.

835
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:23,164
Have fun being an accomplice
to murder, sweetie.

836
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,731
I'll have you
know it's a killer

837
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:28,082
mask doing it, not my friend.

838
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,302
Oh, don't act like
that sounds so weird.

839
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:32,304
SAM: They're right, you know.

840
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:34,219
I should just kill myself.

841
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:36,743
You found an evil
mask, and you put it on.

842
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:39,354
What in God's name did
you think would happen?

843
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:41,835
I don't need your
judgment right now, Chuck.

844
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:45,404
Can you at least remember
where you found this thing?

845
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,587
FREDDIE: We were
scared shitless.

846
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,241
And we'd been
looking everywhere.

847
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:58,460
We even called the police.

848
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,201
When we finally
found him, his body--

849
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:02,856
or what was left of him--

850
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:05,728
his body was just lying
there limp and lifeless,

851
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:08,209
his eyes glazed over.

852
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:13,954
We realized that Brad had gotten
so drunk that he locked himself

853
00:36:13,997 --> 00:36:15,869
in his car and fell asleep.

854
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:19,220
[all laugh]

855
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:19,960
Thank you.

856
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:20,656
Thanks, Freddie.

857
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,615
Thank you, Brad.

858
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:24,443
All right, I'm gonna--

859
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:27,010
I'm gonna tell a
different kind of story.

860
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:28,490
OK?

861
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:30,188
It's sort of, um-- sort
of like a history lesson.

862
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:33,234
It's about this camp,
and it's all true,

863
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:37,804
and it happened right
here on this very land.

864
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:40,328
So long before the French
Cajuns arrived here,

865
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:42,461
the natives lived in
harmony with the land.

866
00:36:42,504 --> 00:36:45,028
It was peaceful back then.

867
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:48,249
But when the Cajun settlers
came with their gris-gris

868
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,078
and their potions
and black magic,

869
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:55,604
they awoke something,
something dark, sinister.

870
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,824
And it struck with a vengeance.

871
00:36:57,867 --> 00:37:00,740
Suddenly, these Cajun settlers
started dying in the most

872
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:02,829
horrific ways, right?

873
00:37:02,872 --> 00:37:04,265
Killing each other.

874
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:05,701
Killing themselves.

875
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:08,269
It went on this
way for many months

876
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:12,752
till finally a [inaudible],,
a medicine man,

877
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:16,843
was able to trap the dark
spirit in an old red oak tree

878
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:19,628
somewhere in these woods.

879
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:23,328
And there it stayed
locked up for 100 years,

880
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:26,418
and people were safe.

881
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:32,424
Until one winter day when a
woodcarver came upon the tree

882
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:35,557
right here in these
woods and he chopped

883
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,559
the tree down to get his wood.

884
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:41,781
But something happened
'cause this woodcarver,

885
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:45,306
his trade was furniture,
children's toys.

886
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:49,963
But that day, something
compelled him to carve a mask.

887
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:53,619
And this mask was unlike--

888
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:55,751
unlike any other.

889
00:37:55,795 --> 00:38:00,626
It had dark empty eyes
that drank in the light,

890
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:02,584
sucking the goodness
out of the world.

891
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,760
JAMIE: Do we have
to listen to this?

892
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:08,895
Aw, somebody's spooked.

893
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:10,418
SAM: Guys, guys, listen.

894
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:12,942
I'd-- I'd stop, but this
isn't just some story.

895
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,466
This is the real
history of this place.

896
00:38:18,774 --> 00:38:19,949
CHUCK: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

897
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:21,255
Wait a minute.

898
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,953
So you're saying
you knew all along

899
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:26,739
that your family's campground
had this creepy history

900
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:28,958
with the evil mask?

901
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:31,352
Not to sound like
a broken record,

902
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:33,354
but why the hell did
you put that mask on?

903
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:35,530
SAM: Would you just
listen to me please?

904
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:41,580
So finally one night when the
woodcarver couldn't sleep,

905
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:44,887
every night he'd
have nightmares.

906
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:47,542
Said to his wife he
was hearing voices.

907
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:50,632
Ever since he carved this
mask, he'd been restless.

908
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:52,591
So he took it out
into the woods,

909
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:54,810
and he goes to destroy the mask.

910
00:38:54,854 --> 00:38:58,031
And as he raises his ax,
again something compels

911
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:02,252
him instead to put the mask on.

912
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:05,299
And although this man was
known as the kindest person

913
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,085
in his town, that
night he killed

914
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:12,001
everybody in the village,
including his own family.

915
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:19,400
There was one survivor.

916
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:21,576
It was a young woman who
happened to be out butchering

917
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,405
chickens, and when
she came back,

918
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:28,061
she used the butcher's ax
to kill the woodcarver.

919
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:29,410
FREDDIE: Wow.

920
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:30,324
Goosebumps.

921
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,978
OK.

922
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,328
But I'm telling you, ever since
this land has been plagued

923
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,765
with all kinds of
weird accidents,

924
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,463
unexplained deaths, murders.

925
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:41,422
I'm sure you guys
have heard stories.

926
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:45,861
But to this day, the evil
mask has never been found.

927
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:48,211
[steve screams]
[all scream]

928
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:49,561
BRAD: Steve!

929
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:50,953
Come on, Steve.

930
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:54,348
You know we don't play
those crazy games.

931
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,436
Crazy white boy Steve.

932
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,481
Come on now.

933
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:57,917
STEVE: Yeah, so, guys, in, uh--

934
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,440
in all seriousness, the
murders were horrendous.

935
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:02,138
So, you know, be
careful out there.

936
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:05,011
And it's also true that
the mask was never found,

937
00:40:05,054 --> 00:40:06,795
and the legend has
it that it's buried

938
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:11,278
at the woodcarver's grave, which
is somewhere on this property.

939
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:12,061
[laughs]

940
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:13,759
OK.

941
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:15,151
Let me get this right.

942
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:19,460
We have a creepy mask
and a cursed grave.

943
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:20,766
Two words, guys.

944
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,942
Treasure hunt.

945
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:23,943
CAROL: Right?

946
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:24,813
Come on.

947
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:25,510
SAM: No, no, no, guys.

948
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:26,554
CAROL: Come on.

949
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:28,121
We're gonna make this fun, Sam.

950
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:29,470
SAM: Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

951
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:30,993
NANCY: Stop being
little boys, seriously.

952
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:32,473
STEVE: Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait wait, wait.

953
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,475
You guys, that's not
the point of the story.

954
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,869
IMANI: Sam, I don't think
your story had a point anyway.

955
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:38,174
It's a cool legend.

956
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:38,827
Guys.

957
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:40,481
CAROL: Yeah.

958
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:41,177
BRAD: He was just trying to
scare us with that story.

959
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:42,004
Come on, baby.

960
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:44,442
[indistinct chatter]

961
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,358
Hi.

962
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:49,751
Hi.

963
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:52,232
Shall we go?

964
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:54,016
What are you talking about?

965
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,802
Your parents have owned this
land for how many years now?

966
00:40:56,845 --> 00:41:00,501
Like you don't know
where the grave is.

967
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:03,504
I-- I mean, maybe.

968
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:04,549
[chuckles]

969
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:05,158
I guess I'll meet you there.

970
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:11,904
No, um--

971
00:41:11,947 --> 00:41:12,774
[chuckles]

972
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:17,083
I mean, I'm sorry.

973
00:41:17,126 --> 00:41:19,738
You know, I'm responsible
for these wackos, so.

974
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:20,782
I understand.

975
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:21,522
Look, I got the fire.

976
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:23,002
I'm cozy.

977
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:23,959
I'll just stay here.

978
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:24,873
You go on.

979
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:31,619
SAM: Uh, hey, guys?

980
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:32,446
Drew.

[foreboding music]

982
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:38,974
Hey, Drew.

983
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:42,238
Come on.

984
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:47,505
This is not funny, guys.

985
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,826
[tense music]

986
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:17,491
Drew?

987
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:21,756
Drew?

988
00:42:26,848 --> 00:42:28,241

989
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:39,905

990
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:41,733
Oh, god!

991
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:42,472
Drew.

992
00:42:42,516 --> 00:42:44,649
DREW: Gotcha.

993
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:46,607
Not funny.

994
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:48,391
Come on.

995
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:50,611
This place is
like creepy cool.

996
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:52,787
So you didn't
actually have any idea

997
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:54,702
what this was, did you?

998
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:58,010
I didn't need to, did I?

999
00:42:58,053 --> 00:42:58,880
[sighs]

1000
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,014
OK, you got me.

1001
00:43:02,057 --> 00:43:02,841
Can we go now?

1002
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,801
Drew, come on.

1003
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:10,152
Let's go back to the
others, all right?

1004
00:43:10,196 --> 00:43:11,893
Do you know if
this says anything?

1005
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:14,635
SAM: Yeah, it says,
"Congratulations, you found me.

1006
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:16,028
Now get the hell out of here."

1007
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:17,333
DREW: Huh.

1008
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:19,640
SAM: You can go brag
to everyone else.

1009
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:21,555
Come on, Drew.

1010
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,991
Seriously, I've
been here a bunch.

1011
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:24,297
It's not a big deal.

1012
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,341
There's a tree.

1013
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:26,473
There's a saddle, the headstone.

1014
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:29,955
DREW: What is this?

1015
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:35,874
SAM: That's the ground.

[voices whispering]

1017
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:41,488
Good one.

1018
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:44,143
What a surprise.

1019
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:44,970
So scared.

1020
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:45,840
Oh my god.

Hey, hey, don't touch that.

00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:53,369
Dude, I know the whole
first night initiation thing.

1024
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:54,806
I've been going to
camps since I was eight.

No, this is not that, OK?

1026

Trust me, please.

1027
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,637
Can we just get out of here?

1028
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,859
Please, just put that
down, and let's go, OK?

1029
00:44:04,903 --> 00:44:05,860
Drew, come on.

1030
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:12,432
Hey, don't put that on.

1031
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:14,739
OK.

00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:16,523

all this craziness,

00:45:34,122 --> 00:45:38,126
it just goes to show you that
history loves repeating itself.

You know, Sleepaway
Camp and killer masks.

00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:51,792
Right.

1064
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:52,924
All right.

1065
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:54,534
Let me see if I
got this straight.

1066
00:45:54,577 --> 00:45:57,929
Drew was your first kill,
and then the skinny dipper.

1067
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:01,584
Then what?

1068
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:05,632
Oh, uh-- And then--

1069
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:09,244
Steve, the Kayak King.

1070
00:46:09,288 --> 00:46:10,071
Did I forget anyone?

1071
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:13,988
Right.

1072
00:46:14,032 --> 00:46:16,686
So without knowing
about the others,

1073
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,558
you've killed eight so far.

1074
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:19,820
Nine.

00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:23,389
Oh.

1077
00:46:23,432 --> 00:46:25,086
OK, so nine.

1078
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,958
SAM: This is so bad.

1079
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:28,829
None of them deserve this.

1080
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:33,442
Well, I think it's
only gonna get worse.

1081
00:46:33,486 --> 00:46:36,141
I think you're
probably gonna die.

1082
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:37,185
Wow.

1084
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:41,276
It's just that's how
these things seem to go.

1085
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,410
On the bright side, though,
in a lot of these cases,

1086
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:46,673
the killer comes back
in a couple of years.

1087
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:48,501
You know, lightning
strikes their grave,

1088
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:52,635
and then they're
back from the dead.

1089
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:53,680
That's not funny.

1090
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:56,944
CHUCK: You know it could happen.

1091
00:46:56,988 --> 00:46:59,642
There's got to be something
that we're missing.

1092
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:03,168
There's just got to be.

1093
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:05,866
How did Imani die?

1094
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:09,783
SAM: OK, uh, after we found
Steve hanging from that tree,

1095
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,176
that's when we all
started making traps.

1096
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:14,179
We figured we had
to catch the killer.

1097
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:14,701
Catch me.

1098
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:23,101
Holy shit, Jamie.

1099
00:47:23,144 --> 00:47:24,232
Did you just do that?

1100
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:25,233
Good job.

1101
00:47:25,277 --> 00:47:27,148
You guys dig a lot of holes?

1102
00:47:27,192 --> 00:47:28,889
It's not quite
the arts and crafts

1103
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:31,152
project I was hoping for, but
we're getting through this.

1104
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:34,460
You know, to be honest, I
liked last summer way better.

1105
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:35,417
Yeah, me too.

1106
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:42,642
My girlfriend and I are going
to culinary school together.

1107
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:47,429
That's the plan anyway
if, uh, I get in.

1108
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:49,040
What are you gonna do?

1109
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:51,433
Marry a rich guy.

1110
00:47:51,477 --> 00:47:52,217
Smart.

1111
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,307
[foreboding music]

1112
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,106
Well, that works.

1113
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,716
OK.

1114
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,717
So we checked the perimeter.

1115
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:15,936
Everything's clear.

1116
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,155
Yeah, there's no
one in that patch,

1117
00:48:17,198 --> 00:48:18,547
so we should be
safe for now, guys.

1118
00:48:18,591 --> 00:48:19,984
IMANI: Guys, what
was all that noise?

1119
00:48:20,027 --> 00:48:22,247
JAMIE: We were just
testing the alert system.

1120
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,465
OK, good.

1121
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:24,902
Sam, what do we do now?

1122
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:28,688
Uh, uh, well, we've
got a secure perimeter.

1123
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:30,168
IMANI: OK, that doesn't
answer our question.

1124
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:31,343
What do we do now?

1125
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:33,954
SAM: Well, I think now we--

1126
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:35,260
you know, we just
circle the wagons.

1127
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,438
Oh, you know, circle the wagons.

1128
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:40,743
Stay inside the safe zone.

1129
00:48:40,787 --> 00:48:42,136
There's a killer out there.

1130
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,833
We circle the wagons,
we'll be sitting ducks.

1131
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:45,009
We need to go after this guy.

1132
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:46,662
Uh.

1133
00:48:46,706 --> 00:48:47,185
OK.

1134
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:48,577
Yeah.

1135
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:51,058
Yeah, let's-- let's
kick it up a notch, man.

1136
00:48:51,102 --> 00:48:55,454
Hey, why don't we combine
offense and defense, huh?

1137
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:56,977
Yeah.

1138
00:48:57,021 --> 00:48:59,327
Um, I'll-- I'll run outside
the perimeter, right?

1139
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:00,111
I'll run around.

1140
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:01,155
I'll be like bait.

1141
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:02,548
OK, and then the killer sees me.

1142
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:04,942
I'll run back, trip the alarm.

1143
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:06,421
He'll come in.

1144
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:08,902
You guys converge on him,
force him into the pit.

1145
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,426
JAMIE: What?
- Y'all seen Jamie's pit?

1146
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,341
NANCY: What if you end up
coming from the other direction?

1147
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:15,561
There's no alarm there.

1148
00:49:15,604 --> 00:49:16,997
How many pots and pans?

1149
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,217
I can go 100 feet that
way and be a lookout.

1151
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,567
Jamie.

1152
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,742
I'll go with her.

1153
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:23,917
SAM: Yeah, that
makes more sense.

00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:24,787

her dig, but she's really,

1264
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:51,260
really gentle.

1265
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:52,610
She loves to paint.

1266
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:54,176
I mean, she wanted to
run arts and crafts.

1267
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,482
CHUCK: Haven't
you learn anything

1268
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:56,962
from the thousands
of hours we've

1269
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:58,746
spent watching horror movies?

1270
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:02,794
If you're the killer,
Jaime's your final girl.

1271
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:04,361
Final--

1272
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:06,145
CHUCK: Laurie in Halloween,
Nancy from Nightmare,

1273
00:56:06,188 --> 00:56:07,102
Sally from Chainsaw.

1274
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:08,756
It happens all the time.

1275
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,411
It's-- it's always
the purest soul.

1276
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:14,283
It's always the last
girl to survive.

1277
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:16,938
Listen, Chuck, I take back
whatever I said about you

1278
00:56:16,982 --> 00:56:18,462
over explaining stuff.

1279
00:56:18,505 --> 00:56:20,986
Well, exposition
is my middle name.

1280
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:25,294
So let's say I kill Jaime.

1281
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:26,208
My god.

1282
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:28,428
I-- I can't kill Jaime.

1283
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:29,429
What am I talking about?

1284
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:31,039
This is crazy.

1285
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:32,345
CHUCK: Well, Is there anyone
left that could kill you,

1286
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,607
anyone at all?

1287
00:56:33,651 --> 00:56:37,350
Uh, whoever lit
that cabin on fire.

1288
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,960
That-- that could be Brad.

1289
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:40,788
You know, it probably
was Brad, and I don't

1290
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:42,399
remember killing him either.

1291
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,792
Well, as soon as you put
that mask on, he's toast.

1292
00:56:44,836 --> 00:56:46,141
Bloody toast.

1293
00:56:46,185 --> 00:56:47,534
SAM: That's insane.

1294
00:56:47,578 --> 00:56:49,623
You're-- you're saying
if I put on this mask,

1295
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:53,975
I can kill some muscle bound
meat head like Brad, but a--

1296
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:56,456
a sweet girl like
Jaime's gonna kill me?

1297
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,763
CHUCK: Yep.

1298
00:56:58,806 --> 00:57:00,634
Wow.

1299
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:03,463
[rustling]

1300
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:05,291
BRAD: There he is.

1301
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:07,336
All right.

1302
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,687
So let me get this straight.

1303
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,341
Only one person walks
out of here alive,

1304
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:13,691
and that's the most pure person.

1305
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:15,388
Always.

1306
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,563
And that's never the killer?

1307
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:17,564
No.

1308
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:18,913
And not just in the movies.

1309
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:20,480
Do you remember
Boondock Butcher?

1310
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:21,786
No, Chuck, I don't remember
the Boondock Butcher.

1311
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:23,222
CHUCK: A kindergarten
teacher put a stop

1312
00:57:23,265 --> 00:57:24,963
to his killing spree,
and she must've weighed

1313
00:57:25,006 --> 00:57:27,400
like 98 pounds soaking wet.

1314
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,446
Captain Howdy, 'member?

1315
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:32,536
Yeah, a nun crushed him
with the steeple bells.

1316
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:35,930
Meaty Face-- oh,
guess who stopped him.

1317
00:57:35,974 --> 00:57:37,671
A paraplegic.

1318
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:41,632
Rolled over him again and again
with spiked wheelchair tires.

1319
00:57:41,675 --> 00:57:43,329
Must've taken like two hours.

1320
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:44,722
All right, all right, enough.
Thank you.

1321
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:45,374
I get it.

1322
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:46,332
I get it.

1323
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,072
OK, Jamie's gonna kill me.

1324
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:47,768
That's great.

1325
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:48,552
That's awesome.

1326
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:49,901
CHUCK: Sorry, Sam.

1327
00:57:49,944 --> 00:57:51,816
Of all the possible
parallel universes,

1328
00:57:51,859 --> 00:57:53,339
you've got to live
and die in this one.

1329
00:57:58,126 --> 00:57:59,345
JAMIE: What are you gonna do?

1330
00:57:59,388 --> 00:58:00,041
Kill the bastard.

1331
00:58:15,056 --> 00:58:18,407
[heavy foreboding music]

1332
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:31,551
No, I don't wanna kill Brad.

1333
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:34,119
I wish this goddamn
mask would kill me.

1334
00:58:34,162 --> 00:58:37,470
[tense music]

1335
00:58:48,786 --> 00:58:49,613
Wait a minute.

1336
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:50,265
I have an idea, Chuck.

1337
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:54,487
Yeah.

1338
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,444
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1339
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:55,923
I have a pretty good idea.

Sam, what's going on?

SAM: It was a bad idea, Chuck.

1345
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:36,790
It didn't work.

1346
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,009
It didn't work.

00:59:38,052 --> 00:59:42,622

But, hey, I figured if
he thought I was dead,

1401
01:02:38,145 --> 01:02:39,190
I'd be off his list, right?

1402
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:40,887
Give me an advantage.

01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:42,671

01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:24,382
Think quick.

1444
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:25,165
JAMIE: Imani.

1445
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:27,167
IMANI: Hold on.

1446
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,168
Ugh, what's this?

1447
01:04:28,212 --> 01:04:30,170
Wait.

1448
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:31,171
Shovel.

1449
01:04:31,215 --> 01:04:31,824
Shovel.

1450
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:32,694
JAMIE: OK.

01:04:38,178 --> 01:04:39,136
JAMIE: Go, go.

1454
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:40,137
Come on.

1455
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:43,140
Let's go.

1456
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:45,055
[sam grunts]

1457
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:51,104
IMANI: There you are, Sam.

1458
01:04:51,148 --> 01:04:52,410
Caged, no other way out.

1459
01:04:52,453 --> 01:04:54,020
SAM: I thought you were dead.

1460
01:04:54,064 --> 01:04:55,848
Oh, and I thought
you were a nice guy,

1461
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,502
but now I want you
to rot in hell.

1462
01:04:57,545 --> 01:04:58,416
Let's go.

1463
01:04:58,459 --> 01:04:59,591
SAM: No.

1464
01:04:59,634 --> 01:05:01,201
No, no, no, no,
no, it wasn't me.

1465
01:05:01,245 --> 01:05:02,594
It was the mask.

1466
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:05,118
The mask made me do it.

1467
01:05:05,162 --> 01:05:05,989
The mask?

1468
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:07,642
SAM: Yes, yes, Jaime.

1469
01:05:07,686 --> 01:05:12,386
Jaime, I swear, I swear I
have fought with every fiber

1470
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,910
of my being against it.

1471
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:14,823
You're such a liar.

1472
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:15,955
SAM: No, I-- I promise.

1473
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:17,130
I've struggled!

1474
01:05:17,174 --> 01:05:19,393
You kept your phone.

1475
01:05:19,437 --> 01:05:20,438
What?

1476
01:05:20,481 --> 01:05:21,178
We had to lock our phones up.

1477
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:21,918
You kept yours.

1478
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:22,962
It's my camp.

1479
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:24,355
I'm responsible for everyone.

1480
01:05:24,398 --> 01:05:26,096
I have to have my phone
in case of an emergency.

1481
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:28,228
It's selfish and two-faced.

1482
01:05:28,272 --> 01:05:30,970
Letting people think you're
dead is pretty damn selfish.

1483
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:31,710
Really?

1484
01:05:31,753 --> 01:05:32,363
Is that right?

1485
01:05:32,406 --> 01:05:34,278
Yeah, yeah.

1486
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:37,542
I was heartbroken enough
when you dumped me.

1487
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:38,586
OK?

1488
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,284
It wasn't just a summer fling.

1489
01:05:40,327 --> 01:05:43,417
You-- you don't think I
wouldn't care if you were dead?

1490
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:44,592
You tried to kill me!

1491
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:45,898
I was not trying
to kill anyone!

1492
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,334
IMANI: Yes, you were!

1493
01:05:47,378 --> 01:05:48,857
Oh my god.

1494
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:50,598
Look, look, look.

1495
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:54,254
You know me better than anyone,
except maybe my friend Chuck.

1496
01:05:54,298 --> 01:05:55,821
You know I'm telling the truth.

1497
01:05:55,864 --> 01:05:59,085
I could never do these
things that I've been doing.

1498
01:05:59,129 --> 01:06:03,350
This-- this thing
makes me do them.

1499
01:06:03,394 --> 01:06:05,570
It-- it's the story
that I told you.

1500
01:06:05,613 --> 01:06:07,746
It has some awful power
when you put it on.

1501
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:11,054
Its evil takes hold of you.

1502
01:06:11,097 --> 01:06:13,012
The legend is true.

1503
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:15,536
If you knew the legend was
true, why'd you put it on?

1504
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,321
That's the thing!

1505
01:06:17,364 --> 01:06:20,977
I didn't put it on.

1506
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:22,674
Drew did.

1507
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:23,631
Yeah.

1508
01:06:23,675 --> 01:06:25,546
Drew put it on me.

1509
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:26,460
IMANI: Drew.

1510
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:27,809
Yes.

1511
01:06:27,853 --> 01:06:29,072
Yes.

1512
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:32,684
We found it at the
woodcarver's grave.

1513
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:34,729
What were you doing with
Drew alone in a forest?

1514
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:36,427
Oh, Jesus.

1515
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:39,038
It would've been nothing if
you didn't have your dumb let's

1516
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:41,127
go on a treasure hunt idea.

1517
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:44,043
You know, Jamie, one
could make the argument

1518
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:46,263
that this whole mess
is Imani's fault.

1519
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:46,915
My fault?

1520
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:47,612
SAM: Yes.

1521
01:06:47,655 --> 01:06:48,874
[imani laughs]

1522
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:50,615
I'm not the one
with the crazy knife,

1523
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:52,182
and I'm not the one who mistakes
a summer fling with something--

1524
01:06:52,225 --> 01:06:53,444
It was more than
a summer fling!

1525
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:54,662
You guys!

1526
01:06:54,706 --> 01:06:57,013
This is not the time.

1527
01:06:57,056 --> 01:06:59,972
Sam, you need to
promise no more killing.

1528
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,452
Oh, no more killing.

1529
01:07:01,495 --> 01:07:04,107
I swear.

1530
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,805
Look, I need you guys to stay
alive so I can stay alive.

1531
01:07:06,848 --> 01:07:08,328
I'm not following
your logic, Sam.

1532
01:07:08,372 --> 01:07:10,504
SAM: Look, I've been
talking to my friend Chuck,

1533
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:12,158
and she says the
way these things

1534
01:07:12,202 --> 01:07:15,727
always go is that it's the
final girl who kills the killer.

1535
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:20,123
So as long as you two
are alive, you know?

1536
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:21,211
No final girl.

1537
01:07:21,254 --> 01:07:22,864
We-- we all stay safe.

1538
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,696
Your friend must be
as crazy as you are.

[sam grunts]

1540
01:07:32,222 --> 01:07:33,179

01:07:33,223 --> 01:07:34,311
OK.

Are you OK?

Well, no, I'm-- I'm
locked up, but that's--

I-- I-- I called the
sheriff by the camp.

should just retire.

Oh.

Um, hey, Chuck.

This is, uh, Imani,
Sam's friend.

Oh.

Hi.

SAM: So, Chuck, I--

1566
01:08:18,268 --> 01:08:20,008
I need you to back
me up here and tell

1567
01:08:20,052 --> 01:08:23,360
these ladies about this whole
final girl thing because I'm--

1568
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:25,144
I'm looking pretty
crazy right now.

01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:28,234
Jamie, she's there too?

1571

Oh, yeah, yeah, Jamie.
Jamie.

01:08:30,193 --> 01:08:32,108
Chuck, Jamie, Jamie, Chuck.

1573
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:33,370
Yeah, yeah, Jamie's here.

1574
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:35,981
Um, Jamie hit me with a shovel.

1575
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:36,808
OK.

1576
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:38,375
OK, um, well, yeah.

1577
01:08:38,418 --> 01:08:43,684
Uh, first of all, ladies,
I know this is all insane.

1578
01:08:43,728 --> 01:08:45,208
Just bear with me for a minute.

1579
01:08:45,251 --> 01:08:49,690
But, OK, whatever you
do, do not let Sam put

1580
01:08:49,734 --> 01:08:52,606
the mask on his face again, OK?

1581
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:57,481
The mask is responsible
for all this, not Sam.

Come on.

01:09:24,464 --> 01:09:26,814
Do it.

01:09:26,858 --> 01:09:29,774
And, Jamie, from
what Sam says,

1593
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:31,210
that-- that sounds like you.

1594
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:35,562
No offense, Imani.

IMANI: Um, Sam's
getting the mask.

01:09:51,491 --> 01:09:53,798
Guys, run.

01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:56,235

01:10:17,865 --> 01:10:19,258
Nope.

1607
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:20,607
I know where you're going.

1608
01:10:20,651 --> 01:10:22,348
Imani, what the
hell are you doing?

1609
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:23,871
We're not gonna
be able to stop him.

1610
01:10:23,915 --> 01:10:25,482
Well, it's not gonna
help if you turn on me.

1611
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:27,527
CHUCK: I'm not sure
there's much either of you

1612
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:30,182
can do to alter the
course of these events.

1613
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,836
So it goes.

1614
01:10:31,879 --> 01:10:34,360
Oh, no, Chuck, we can make
this happen any kind of way.

1615
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:36,362
And I know I'm more equipped
to kill Sam than Little

a logic problem, Imani.

No matter how strong or
smart you think you are,

01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:47,852
no matter how determined,
you just can't outplay this.

1620
01:10:47,895 --> 01:10:51,595
There's just no way that
you're the pure soul that

1621
01:10:51,638 --> 01:10:53,379

1622

I'm sorry.

1623
01:10:54,162 --> 01:10:55,468
You just aren't.

1624
01:10:55,512 --> 01:10:56,991
Yeah?

1625
01:10:57,035 --> 01:10:58,297
Well, there's more to
purity than meets the eye,

1626
01:10:58,341 --> 01:11:00,256
and I know she's not
this perfect image

1627
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:01,387
she shows everybody.

1628
01:11:06,827 --> 01:11:07,524
Do you party?

1629
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:13,791
- Why?
- Drugs, alcohol, caffeine even?

1630
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:14,661
No.

1631
01:11:14,705 --> 01:11:16,141
Just face it, Imani.

1632
01:11:16,184 --> 01:11:17,360
You're not a virgin, are you?

1633

JAMIE: That's personal.

1634
01:11:18,752 --> 01:11:20,276
IMANI: Yeah, so is
life and death, baby.

1635
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,451
And it's down to me and you.

1636
01:11:21,494 --> 01:11:22,669
So are you a virgin?
JAMIE: Yes!

1637
01:11:25,977 --> 01:11:27,370
Are you happy now?

1638
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:29,023
Nope.

JAMIE: What do I do now?

You-- you've got to kill Sam.

should be running.

01:12:25,993 --> 01:12:27,908

How are you gonna do that?

JAMIE: I have a shovel.

1662
01:12:37,222 --> 01:12:38,702
No.

1663
01:12:38,745 --> 01:12:40,965
No, you can't possibly
take out evil this powerful

with a shovel.

1665
01:12:42,314 --> 01:12:43,315
I'm sorry.

1666
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,403
You're just not.

1667
01:12:44,447 --> 01:12:46,100
Then what am I supposed to do?

1668
01:12:46,144 --> 01:12:48,364

Just go there.

I don't know where that is.

01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:02,334
OK, uh.

01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,858
After Sam killed
Drew, he-- he, uh--

01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:07,252
he killed Ted and Allison
in a swimming pool.

around there somewhere.

You just let me know.

1799
01:19:43,604 --> 01:19:44,518
VOICES: [WHISPERING] Put it on.

1800
01:19:49,045 --> 01:19:50,524
SAM: You good?

1801
01:19:50,568 --> 01:19:52,135
How you doing?

1802
01:19:52,178 --> 01:19:54,746
Just an appropriate size hole.

1803
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,880
[tense music]

1804
01:20:01,579 --> 01:20:05,801
Put it in the hole and bury it.

1805
01:20:05,844 --> 01:20:07,585
Right?

1806
01:20:07,628 --> 01:20:10,022
Then we'll be done.

1807
01:20:10,066 --> 01:20:11,415
We'll be done.

1808
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:13,678
Now you just let me
know when you're done.

1809
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:17,769
Just tap me on the shoulder or
just whistle or-- or something

1810
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,685
so I don't risk look--
looking at it, OK?

1811
01:20:20,728 --> 01:20:23,035
[footsteps]

1812
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,258
Jamie?

1813
01:20:28,301 --> 01:20:29,215
Are you done?

1814
01:20:29,259 --> 01:20:32,653
[tense music]

1815
01:20:35,743 --> 01:20:36,092
Jaime?

[phone vibrates]

1821
01:21:26,446 --> 01:21:27,012
Hello?

1822
01:21:27,056 --> 01:21:27,447
Sam?

1823
01:21:30,755 --> 01:21:31,712
It's over.

1824
01:21:31,756 --> 01:21:33,932
I finished it.

1825
01:21:33,976 --> 01:21:36,500
Oh.

1826
01:21:36,543 --> 01:21:39,416
OK.

1827
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:42,071
May he rest in peace.

1828
01:21:42,114 --> 01:21:42,985
Bye, Chuck.

SHERIFF JAMES: Sam,
Sheriff James here.

1833
01:22:17,454 --> 01:22:19,543
Just got in the office
and I heard your voicemail

1834
01:22:19,586 --> 01:22:21,327
and your friend's too.

1835
01:22:21,371 --> 01:22:23,242
Look, I know you kids
love messing around,

1836
01:22:23,286 --> 01:22:25,810
but I don't think that land's
something to joke about.

1837
01:22:25,853 --> 01:22:28,769
Things have been good out there
since your family took over,

1838
01:22:28,813 --> 01:22:30,641
and I can't imagine
you doing anything

1839
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:32,556
to screw that up, right?

1840
01:22:32,599 --> 01:22:34,166
My granddaughter will
be at camp this year,

1841
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:36,821
so keep an eye on her.

1842
01:22:36,864 --> 01:22:38,475
I'll be sure to come by
and make sure everyone's

1843
01:22:38,518 --> 01:22:39,998
staying out of trouble.

1844
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:41,521
Bye, Sam.

1845
01:22:41,565 --> 01:22:44,916
[heavy ominous music]

1846
01:23:02,934 --> 01:23:06,372

Rings of Saturn.

1849
01:23:24,869 --> 01:23:26,044
This is Chuck.

1850
01:23:26,088 --> 01:23:27,132
SAM: Chuck!

1851
01:23:27,176 --> 01:23:28,133

[upbeat rock music]

1854
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:51,069
SINGER: [SINGING] I was
on the hunt for blood.

1855
01:23:51,113 --> 01:23:53,985
You were feeling lost in love.

1856
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:59,991
All it took was just one
look and you were into me.

1857
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,994
I wish that I
could cut you free.

1858
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,953
But you're already in too deep.

1859
01:24:05,997 --> 01:24:10,436
You feel the curiosity
of what we could be.

1860
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,439
Baby, if it's on,
don't hesitate.

1861
01:24:13,483 --> 01:24:16,442
I promise you I'll
be your best mistake.

1862
01:24:16,486 --> 01:24:17,922
You found me for a reason.

1863
01:24:17,965 --> 01:24:19,358
Call it fate.

1864
01:24:19,402 --> 01:24:22,405
Call-- call it fate.
'Cause it's feeling great.

1865
01:24:22,448 --> 01:24:25,408
The night's about to get real.

1866
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:28,411
We're going in for the kill.

1867
01:24:28,454 --> 01:24:29,934
This is power.

1868
01:24:29,977 --> 01:24:32,371
It's not cold-hearted.

1869
01:24:32,415 --> 01:24:35,896
And we're just getting started.

1870
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,899
We've been having so much fun.

1871
01:24:38,943 --> 01:24:41,902
This night's been a thriller.

1872
01:24:41,946 --> 01:24:44,862
Don't think about
what we've done.

1873
01:24:44,905 --> 01:24:47,865
You might be the killer.

1874
01:24:47,908 --> 01:24:50,868
You can take your hands off me.

1875
01:24:50,911 --> 01:24:53,871
This night's been a thriller.

1876
01:24:53,914 --> 01:24:56,874
As long as you see what I see.

1877
01:24:56,917 --> 01:24:59,833
You might be the killer.

1878
01:24:59,877 --> 01:25:02,836
We've been having so much fun.

1879
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,839
This night's been a thriller.

1880
01:25:05,883 --> 01:25:08,842
Don't think about
what we've done.

1881
01:25:08,886 --> 01:25:12,324
You might be the killer.

1882
01:25:12,368 --> 01:25:14,805
You can take your hands off me.

1883
01:25:14,848 --> 01:25:17,808
This night's been a thriller.

1884
01:25:17,851 --> 01:25:20,811
As long as you see what I see.

1885
01:25:20,854 --> 01:25:24,293
You might be the killer.

1886
01:25:24,336 --> 01:25:30,081
Baby, after just one touch,
I knew I'd never get enough.

1887
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:36,087
You should know I like it rough,
but you'll get used to me.

1888
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:39,090
Baby, you can count me dead.

1889
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:42,093
Sleep by all the
things you said.

1890
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:48,055
But, baby, you look good in
red, so just keep killing me.

1891
01:25:48,099 --> 01:25:50,754
We've been having so much fun.

1892
01:25:50,797 --> 01:25:53,757
This night's been a thriller.

1893
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,760
Don't think about
what we've done.

1894
01:25:56,803 --> 01:26:00,067
You might be the killer.

1895
01:26:00,111 --> 01:26:02,766
You can take your hands off me.

1896
01:26:02,809 --> 01:26:06,073
This night's been a thriller.

1897
01:26:06,117 --> 01:26:08,772
As long as you see what I see.

1898
01:26:08,815 --> 01:26:10,165
You might be the killer.

1899
01:26:14,821 --> 01:26:16,171
You might be the killer.

1900
01:26:21,132 --> 01:26:22,177
And we're just getting started.

1901
01:26:36,103 --> 01:26:38,758
We've been having so much fun.

1902
01:26:38,802 --> 01:26:41,761
This night's been a thriller.

1903
01:26:41,805 --> 01:26:44,764
Don't think about
what we've done.

1904
01:26:44,808 --> 01:26:48,072
You might be the killer.

1905
01:26:48,115 --> 01:26:50,770
You can take your hands off me.

1906
01:26:50,814 --> 01:26:54,078
This night's been a thriller.

1907
01:26:54,121 --> 01:26:56,776
As long as you see what I see.

1908
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:58,213
You might be the killer.

1909
01:27:02,782 --> 01:27:04,175
You might be the killer.
