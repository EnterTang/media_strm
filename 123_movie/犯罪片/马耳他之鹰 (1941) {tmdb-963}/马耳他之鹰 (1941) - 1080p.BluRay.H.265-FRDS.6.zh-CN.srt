1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,620
片名：马耳他之鹰/枭巢喋血战

2
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:04,950
1539年，马耳他圣殿骑士
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}向西班牙查理五世朝贡

3
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:12,950
送给他一只浑身上下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}包裹着稀世珍宝的金鹰

4
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,950
但海盗拦截了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}这艘载有无价之宝的船只

5
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,990
马耳他之鹰的命运至今仍是谜团

6
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,960
三藩市

7
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,990
金门大桥

8
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,600
怎样，小甜心？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Yes, sweetheart? -There's a girl wants to see you.

9
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,310
有个叫旺德莉的女子来找你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Her name's Wonderly.

10
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,350
客户吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Customer? -I guess so.

11
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,640
我想是吧，你会很想见她的 她是大美女
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'll want to see her, anyway. She's a knockout.

12
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,560
请她进来吧，爱菲，请她进来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shoo her in, Effie, darling. Shoo her in.

13
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,130
请进，旺德莉小姐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}EFFIE: Will you come in, Miss Wonderly?

14
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,920
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

15
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,840
- 请坐，旺德莉小姐 - 谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Won't you sit down, Miss Wonderly? -Thank you.

16
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,810
我跟旅馆打听过可靠私家侦探的消息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I inquired at the hotel for the name of a private detective.

17
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,070
他们提到你的名字
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They mentioned yours.

18
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,970
请从头跟我讲起吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Suppose you tell me about it from the very beginning.

19
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,730
我是纽约人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I'm from New York. -Uh-huh.

20
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,400
我在找我妹
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm trying to find my sister.

21
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,660
我相信她人在三藩市这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have reason to believe that she's here...

22
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,880
跟一个名字叫佛洛德?德斯派的人在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...with a man by the name of Thursby. Floyd Thursby.

23
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,900
我不晓得他们是在哪认识的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know where she met him.

24
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,840
我们一直不很亲近
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We've never been as close as sisters ought to be.

25
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,720
如果亲近点，柯琳就会告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If we had, perhaps Corinne would have told me

26
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,470
她计划和他私奔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}she was planning on running away.

27
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,720
爸妈去了檀香山
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mother and Father are in Honolulu.

28
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,020
他们会急死的 我必须在我爸妈回来前找到她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've got to find her before they get back.

29
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,350
他们下月一号回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-They're coming home the first.

30
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,020
你收到过你妹的消息吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You've had word of your sister?

31
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,400
两周前她给我写过一封信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A letter from her about two weeks ago.

32
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,860
她只说她没事，很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It said nothing except that she was all right.

33
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,130
我曾发电报给她，求她回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I sent her a telegram, begging her to come home.

34
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,130
我是寄到这里存局候领的 那是她唯一给我的地址
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I sent it to General Delivery. That was the address she gave.

35
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,790
等了一个星期，还是没回音 所以就决定自己来看看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I waited a week and no answer came, so I decided to come out here myself.

36
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,780
我曾写信告诉她我会来 我不该那样，是吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wrote her that I was coming. I shouldn't have done that, should I?

37
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,230
知道该做什么可没那么容易
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's not always easy to know what to do.

38
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,690
还是没找到？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You haven't found her?

39
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,860
没，我在信里要她在圣马克见面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. I told her in my letter that I'd be at the St. Mark and for her to meet me there.

40
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,790
我等了三天，她没来 就连口信也没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I waited three whole days. She didn't come, didn't even send a message.

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,100
等待是可怕的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It was horrible, waiting.

42
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,490
我又寄了封存局候领
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I sent her another letter.

43
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,900
昨天下午，我去了邮局一趟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yesterday afternoon, I went to the post office.

44
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,280
柯琳没有去拿她的信，但佛洛德去了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Corinne didn't call for her mail, but Floyd Thursby did.

45
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,730
他不告诉我柯琳在哪里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He wouldn't tell me where Corinne was.

46
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,840
他只说她不想见我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He said she didn't want to see me.

47
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
真不敢相信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't believe that.

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,940
他还答应如果她肯来，就今晚带她来旅馆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He promised to bring her to the hotel, if she'd come.

49
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,340
他说他知道她不肯来的 他应承说如果她不来，他自己也会来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He said he knew she wouldn't. He promised to come himself if she didn't. He--

50
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,250
抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, excuse me.

51
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,050
没事，进来吧，麦尔斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, it's all right, Miles. Come in.

52
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,820
旺德莉小姐，这位是我搭档，麦尔斯?阿契尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miss Wonderly, my partner, Miles Archer.

53
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,880
旺德莉小姐的妹妹从纽约家里逃出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miss Wonderly's sister ran away...

54
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,420
跟一个名叫佛洛德?德斯派的家伙跑了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...with a fellow named Floyd Thursby.

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,260
他们目前人在三藩市这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They're here in San Francisco.

56
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,660
旺德莉小姐见过德斯派，约好今晚碰面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miss Wonderly has seen Thursby, has a date to meet him.

57
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,460
他也许会带她妹去，极有可能他不会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe he'll bring the sister with him. Chances are he won't.

58
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,430
她要我们帮她找妹妹，带她回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miss Wonderly wants us to find the sister, get her away from him and back home.

59
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,910
- 是吧？- 是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Right? -Yes.

60
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,840
很简单，今晚找个人去旅馆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, it's simply a matter of having a man at the hotel this evening...

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,340
跟着他到你妹妹那里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...to shadow him when he leads us to your sister.

62
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,680
如果她还是不想离开他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If, after we've found her, she still doesn't want to leave him....

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,310
- 我们自有办法 - 没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Well, we have ways of managing that. -Yeah.

64
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,580
但请小心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But you must be careful.

65
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,140
我很怕他，怕他做出什么事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm deathly afraid of him, of what he might do.

66
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,990
她这么年轻，他把她从纽约 带到这里是很严重的…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's so young. His bringing her here is a serious--

67
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,320
他不会对她做什么吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mightn't he do something to her?

68
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,780
别担心，我们会处理的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Leave that to us. We'll know how to handle him.

69
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,220
但他这个人很危险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I want you to know he's a dangerous man.

70
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,780
我真的认为他这个人什么都干得出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I honestly don't think he'd stop at anything.

71
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,460
他会毫不犹豫杀死柯琳自救
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't think he'd hesitate to kill Corinne if he thought it would save him.

72
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,930
他会不会用和她结婚来掩饰？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Could he cover up by marrying her?

73
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,530
他在英国有妻小
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He has a wife and three children in England.

74
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,210
他们常常住英国，但不尽然 形容一下他吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They usually do, though not always in England. What's he look like?

75
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,100
他的头发很黑，眉毛很浓密
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He has dark hair and thick, bushy eyebrows.

76
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,410
讲话音量很大
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He talks in a loud, blustery manner.

77
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,750
看起来就很暴力的样子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He gives the impression of being violent.

78
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,590
今天早上他穿了一套灰色行头
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He was wearing a light gray suit and a gray hat when I saw him this morning.

79
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,680
- 他是干哪一行的？ - 不晓得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What does he do for a living? -I haven't the faintest idea.

80
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,250
- 你们约几点见面？ - 八点以后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What time's he coming to see you? -After 8:00.

81
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,250
好的，旺德莉小姐，我们会派人过去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, Miss Wonderly. We'll have a man there.

82
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,350
我亲自出马
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll look after it myself.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,290
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, thank you.

84
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,970
对了…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yes.

85
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,580
够吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Will that be enough?

86
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,540
- 谢谢 - 不客气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Thank you. -Not at all.

87
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,640
如果你跟德斯派在大厅碰面会有所帮助的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It'll help some if you meet Thursby in the lobby.

88
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,440
- 我会的- 到时别找我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I will. -You don't have to look for me.

89
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,940
- 我会暗中保护你的- 谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I'll see you all right. -Thank you.

90
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,420
- 非常感激 - 再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Thank you so much. -Goodbye.

91
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,730
真金白银
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They're right enough.

92
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,260
我看她包里还不少
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They have brothers in her bag.

93
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,200
- 你觉得她怎样？- 很可爱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What do you think of her? -Oh, she's sweet.

94
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,000
也许是你先看到她的 山姆，但是我先开口的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe you saw her first, Sam, but I spoke first.

95
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,500
你还真会动脑筋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've got brains.

96
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,210
没错，是这样的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, you have.

对，请讲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Speaking.

101
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,940
麦尔斯?阿契尔死了？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miles Archer dead?

102
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,310
哪里？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Where?

103
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,580
斯托克顿布什街
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bush and Stockton?

104
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,670
好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah.

105
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,600
15分钟赶到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In 15 minutes.

谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thanks.

107
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,630
爱菲吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello, Effie?

108
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,000
是我！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's me.

109
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,510
听我讲，宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, listen, precious.

110
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,310
麦尔斯被枪杀了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miles has been shot. [EFFIE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

111
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,450
对…死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Dead.

112
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,580
别激动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, don't get excited.

113
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,250
对…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah.

114
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,290
你负责告诉伊娃这个噩耗，我先行动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, you'll have to break the news to Iva. I'd fry first.

115
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,780
不要告诉她我的行踪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And keep her away from me.

116
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,790
这样才乖嘛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's a good girl.

117
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,320
赶快过去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now get right over there.

118
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,890
你简直是太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're an angel.

119
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,100
再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bye.

120
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,050
- 你想干嘛？- 我叫山姆?史派特，汤姆?柏郝斯打过电话给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What do you want here? -I'm Sam Spade. Tom Polhaus phoned.

121
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,080
我刚刚还认不出你他们在后面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I didn't know you at first. They're back there.

122
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,760
你好，山姆，我想在我们带走他前，你会想看看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}POLHAUS: Hello, Sam. I figured you'd want to see it before we took him away.

123
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,330
谢谢，汤姆，怎么回事？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Well, thanks, Tom. What happened?

124
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,780
被这把威布利
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Got him right through the pump with this.

125
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,210
枪杀的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's a Webley.

126
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,380
英制品，对吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}English, ain't it?

127
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,140
对，威布利福斯裴利点45自动手枪，8发，绝版了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. A Webley-Fosbery .45 automatic, eight shot. They don't make them anymore.

128
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,650
- 开了几枪？- 一枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-How many gone out of it? -Just one.

129
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,590
往这里开，对吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}SPADE:Let's see. Shot up here, huh?

130
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,910
就跟你一样这样站着，背对着围栏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Standing like you are, with his back to the fence.

131
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,160
开枪的人站在这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The man who shot him stood here.

132
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,380
他后仰翻过围栏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He went over, taking the top of the fence.

133
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,590
掉下山，被那块石头接住，对吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Went on down the hill and got caught on that rock.

134
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,500
枪爆烧到他的外套
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's it. The blast burnt his coat.

135
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,800
- 是谁发现的？ - 巡逻的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Who found him? -Man on the beat.

136
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,990
- 还有没有别人听到枪声？- 一定有，我们刚到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Anybody hear the shot? -Somebody must've. We just got here.

137
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,560
在我带走他以前，你还想看看他吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You want to go down and have a look at him?

138
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,840
不了，该看的你都看到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, you've seen everything I could.

139
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,170
他的枪还插在身后没开过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}His gun was tucked away. Hadn't been fired.

140
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,680
他的外套扣着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}His overcoat was buttoned.

141
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,510
我在他的背心口袋里找到一张百元钞票，裤袋里还有三十几块
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I found a $100 bill in his vest pocket and 30-some bucks in his pants.

142
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,340
他在执行任务，是吧，山姆？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Was he working, Sam?

143
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,580
怎样？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well?

144
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,350
- 对，他在跟踪一个名叫德斯派的家伙 - 干嘛？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Yeah, he was tailing a guy named Thursby. -What for?

145
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,210
干嘛？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What for?

146
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,520
想知道他住哪里，别盘问我了，汤姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He wanted to find out where he lived. Don't crowd me, Tom.

147
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,720
我要去通知麦尔斯的太太噩耗了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm going on down and break the news to Miles' wife.

148
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,530
一定很为难吧？他死得那么惨
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's tough, him getting it like that, ain't it?

149
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,490
麦尔斯自己也有错，就像我们所有人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miles had his faults, like any of us...

150
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,770
但我想他的优点也不少
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but I guess he must've had some good points too, huh?

151
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,400
我想是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I guess so.

152
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,910
请找旺德莉小姐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miss Wonderly, please.

153
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,200
退房了吗？几点？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh? Checked out? What time?

154
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,740
有没有留回信地址？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Any forwarding address?

155
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,540
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thanks.

156
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,900
你好，汤姆，你好啊，警探，请进
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}SPADE: Oh, hello, Tom. Hello, lieutenant. Come in.

157
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,750
请坐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sit down.

158
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,290
请坐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sit down.

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,160
想喝什么？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Drink?

160
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,630
你跟麦尔斯的太太讲过了吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did you break the news to Miles' wife, Sam?

161
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,270
她承受得了吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Uh-huh. -How'd she take it?

162
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,700
- 我不了解女人 - 从何时开始？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I don't know anything about women. -Since when?

163
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,260
你配什么枪？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What kind of a gun do you carry?

164
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,380
没，我不喜欢枪，当然办公室里有几把
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-None. I don't like them. -Course, there are some at the office.

165
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,370
这里没有吗？你确定？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You don't have one here?

166
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,540
到处看啊 可以把垃圾桶翻个底朝天啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You sure about that? -Look around. Turn the dump upside down.

167
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,640
如果你有搜查令的话，我不会抗议的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I won't squawk, if you got a search warrant.

168
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,700
我们不想搞出…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-We don't wanna-- -What are you birds sucking around for?

169
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,640
我不喜欢这样！你们来究竟为什么，直说，要不走人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell me or get out.

170
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,020
你不能这样待我们 山姆，我们有公务在身
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can't treat us like that. It ain't right. We got our work to do.

171
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,650
你干嘛跟踪德斯派？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why were you tailing Thursby?

172
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,980
我没有，麦尔斯在跟 原因很简单，我们的客户…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miles was, and for the simple reason we had a lient--

173
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,920
- 谁？- 这一点我不能讲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Who's the client? -Sorry, I can't tell you that.

174
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,380
拜托，山姆，说吧，你查到什么线索
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Be reasonable, Sam. Give us a break, will you?

175
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,760
要不我们怎么查麦尔斯被杀的案子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How we gonna turn up anything if you don't tell us what you got?

176
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,570
汤姆说，你匆忙得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tom says you were in too much of a hurry

177
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,830
看都不看一眼死去的搭档
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to stop and look at your dead partner.

178
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,360
你也没去阿契尔的家和他太太讲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And you didn't go to Archer's house to tell his wife.

179
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,070
我们打过电话去你办公室 那个女孩说，是你要她那样做的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We called your office and the girl there said you told her to do it.

180
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,140
我给你十分钟打电话给那个女孩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll give you 10 minutes to get a phone and do your talking to the girl.

181
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,600
给你十分钟联络德斯派的住所
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll give you 10 minutes to get to Thursby's. Geary and Leavenworth.

182
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,710
GL那里，你轻而易举可以做到的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You could do it easily.

183
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,810
你男朋友说什么啊，汤姆？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What's your boyfriend getting at, Tom?

184
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,870
德斯派在他的旅馆外被枪击了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just this, Thursby was shot down in front of his hotel...

185
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,110
你离开布什街半小时后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...about a half an hour after you left Bush Street.

186
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,450
把你的爪子拿开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Keep your paws off me.

187
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,260
你到家时几点？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What time did you get home?

188
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,120
比你早到就是了，我闲逛了一下想事情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just a few minutes ahead of you. I was walking around, thinking.

189
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,990
我们知道你去了那里，我们在电话上找过你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We know you weren't here. Where did you walk to?

190
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,590
- 你去了哪里？- 布什街
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Up Bush Street. -You see anybody--?

191
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,360
- 你看到什么人…- 不，没有目击证人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}SPADE: No. No witnesses.

192
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,930
我知道自己的处境了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I know where I stand, now.

193
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,230
抱歉我站起来了，伙计们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry I got up on my hind legs,

194
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,220
但你们想吊死我，让我很紧张
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but you fellas trying to rope me made me nervous.

195
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,300
麦尔斯的死本来就让我心烦意乱 你们又来搅局
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miles getting bumped off upset me, and then you birds cracking foxy.

196
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,710
但没事，我现在了解情况了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's all right, now I know what it's all about.

197
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,100
算了，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Forget it, Sam.

198
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,580
德斯派死了？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Thursby die? -Yeah.

199
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,040
我是怎么干掉德斯派的？我忘了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How'd I kill him? I forget.

200
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,710
他背后中四枪，点44或点45手枪 街对面开的枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He was shot in the back four times with a .44 or .45 from across the street.

201
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,150
没人看到，但看得出来是这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nobody saw it, but that's how it figures.

202
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,680
旅馆服务员知道他什么吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Hotel people know anything?

203
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,280
没什么，就知道他在那里住了一周
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Nothing, except that he lived there a week.

204
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,850
- 一个人？- 对，一个人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Alone? -Yeah, alone.

205
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,480
他是什么人？他搞什么把戏？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did you find out who he was? What his game was? Well, did you?

206
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,690
- 我们以为你知道- 我从没见过德斯派，不管死的活的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-We thought you could tell us that. -I've never seen Thursby, dead or alive.

207
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,160
你了解我的，史派德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, you know me, Spade.

208
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,420
不管是不是你干的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you did it, or if you didn't...

209
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,290
我还是会和你公平交易，提供给你线索
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...you'll get a square deal and most of the breaks.

210
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,570
我不会怪你，别人干掉了你的搭档…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't know as I'd blame you much. The man that killed your partner.

211
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,200
但我还是会盯着你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But that won't stop me from nailing you.

212
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,330
很公平
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fair enough.

213
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,770
但你们和我喝一杯我会感觉好点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I'd feel better about it if you'd have a drink with me.

214
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,210
祝成功破案
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Success to crime.

215
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,220
德斯派，阿契尔谋杀案并案

216
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:33,220
私家侦探在跟踪德斯派

217
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,360
她在里面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}EFFIE: She's in there.

218
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,890
- 我让你帮我挡她的 - 你没教我方法嘛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I told you to keep her away from me. Yes, but you didn't tell me how.

219
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,630
别对我发脾气，山姆，我受了她一整晚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, don't be cranky with me, Sam. I've had her all night.

220
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,740
抱歉，亲爱的，我不是想…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry, angel. I didn't mean--

221
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,870
你好，伊娃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello, Iva.

222
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,480
山姆…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, Sam.

223
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,920
亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Darling.

224
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,320
爱菲都处理得很好吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Effie take care of everything?

225
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,720
我想是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think so.

226
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,620
山姆，是你杀的他吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sam, did you kill him?

227
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,320
是谁这样跟你讲的啊？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who put that bright idea in your head?

228
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,430
我还记得你说过 要不是为了麦尔斯，你已经…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I thought you said if it wasn't for Miles, you'd....

229
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,070
对我好点，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Be kind to me, Sam.

230
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,470
你杀了我丈夫，山姆…对我好点！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}"You killed my husband, Sam. Be kind to me."

231
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,320
不要，伊娃，不要！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't, Iva. Don't.

232
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,190
你不该来这里的，你必须待在家里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You shouldn't have come here today, darling. You ought to be home.

233
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,860
你会很快到，是吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'll come soon?

234
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,490
尽快就是了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Soon as I can.

235
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,390
再见，伊娃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Goodbye, Iva.

236
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,650
怎样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}EFFIE: Well?

237
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,410
你跟那个寡妇搞得怎样？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How did you and the widow make out?

238
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,290
她以为麦尔斯是我干掉的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-She thinks I shot Miles.

239
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,130
- 这样你就可以娶她了？ - 条子以为德斯派是我干掉的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-So you could marry her?The cops think I killed Thursby,

240
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,780
那个麦尔斯帮旺德莉女士跟踪的家伙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the guy Miles was tailing for that Wonderly dame.

241
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,320
你觉得我干掉谁啦？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who do you think I shot?

242
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,860
你会娶伊娃吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you going to marry Iva?

243
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,860
别傻了，真希望我从没看到过她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't be silly. I wish I'd never laid eyes on her.

244
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,530
她会不会干掉他啊？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you suppose she could have killed him?

245
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,090
真有你的，简直就是笨得可爱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're an angel. A nice, rattlebrained little angel.

246
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,090
- 是吗？ - 谢谢，甜心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Oh, am I? -Thanks, honey.

247
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,010
如果我告诉你你的伊娃没回家多久
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Suppose I told you Iva hadn't been home many minutes...

248
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,070
当我凌晨3点给她带去噩耗时…？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...when I arrived to break the news at 3:00 this morning?

249
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,310
你会告诉我吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you telling me?

250
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,640
她脱衣服时要我在门边等她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She kept me waiting while she undressed.

251
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,700
她的衣帽，内衣扔在椅子上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Her clothes were on a chair where she'd dumped them, hat and coat underneath.

252
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,810
她的内衣还是温的咧！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Her slip, on top, was still warm.

253
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,450
她弄皱了床，但皱纹也没压扁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She'd wrinkled the bed, but the wrinkles weren't mashed down.

254
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,380
你真有侦探的料，但不是她干的，亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're a detective, darling, but she didn't kill him.

255
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,250
条子真以为那个谁是你干掉的吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do the police really think you shot this what's-his-name?

256
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,730
看着我，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do they? Look at me, Sam.

257
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,520
我很担心你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You worry me.

258
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,220
你总以为一切尽在掌握
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You think you know what you're doing,

259
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,860
你太精于为自己打算
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but you're too slick for your own good.

260
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,490
你有天会发现的 史派特和阿契尔事务所
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Someday you're going to find it out. Spade and Archer.

261
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,560
旺德莉小姐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yes, Miss Wonderly.

262
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,540
喂…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello?

263
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,480
是，我是山姆?史派特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, this is Sam Spade.

264
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,110
哪里？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Where?

265
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,340
加利福尼亚巷柯罗纳特公寓，1001室
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Coronet Apartments, California Avenue, apartment 1001.

266
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,180
叫什么名？李白朗小姐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's the name? Miss LeBlanc.

267
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,050
我马上过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, I'll be right over.

268
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,750
把麦尔斯的桌子搬出办公室
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, have Miles' desk moved out of the office...

269
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,390
换掉门上和窗上的 “史派特和阿契尔”字样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and have "Spade and Archer" taken off all the doors and windows...

270
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,620
改成“山姆?史派特”
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and have "Samuel Spade" put on.

271
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,140
进来吧，史派特先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, come in, Mr. Spade.

272
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,340
一团乱，都还没整理好，请坐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Everything's upside down. I haven't finished unpacking. Sit down.

273
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,780
史派特先生，我…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mr. Spade, I....

274
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,720
我必须要跟你忏悔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have a terrible, terrible confession to make.

275
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,960
我昨天跟你讲的那一切…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That story I told you yesterday...

276
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,990
是捏造的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...was just a story.

277
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,530
我们也没太相信…小姐…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, that. Well, we didn't exactly believe your story, Miss....

278
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,200
你名叫旺德莉还是李白朗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What is your name, Wonderly or LeBlanc?

279
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,430
说真的，是奥夏克尼希 布瑞怡特?奥夏克尼希
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's really O'Shaughnessy. Brigid O'Shaughnessy.

280
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,000
我们没相信你讲的那些 布瑞怡特?奥夏克尼希
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We didn't believe your story, Miss O'Shaughnessy.

281
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,600
- 我们只是相信你的两百块 - 你是指…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-We believed your $200. -You mean that....

282
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,070
如果你讲的是实话，就不会付这么多钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You paid us more than if you'd been telling the truth...

283
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,380
付得太多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and enough more to make it all right.

284
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,810
史派德，昨晚的事怪我吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell me, Mr. Spade, am I to blame for last night?

285
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,050
你警告过我们德斯派是危险人物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You warned us that Thursby was dangerous.

286
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,180
关于你妹的事，你撒了谎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course, you lied to us about your sister,

287
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,920
但那不算，我们没上当
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but we didn't believe you.

288
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,450
不，我不会说是你的错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I wouldn't say that you were at fault.

289
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,750
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

290
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,420
阿契尔先生昨天还活生生的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mr. Archer was so alive yesterday...

291
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,900
- 如此立体和亲切…- 够了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-...so solid and hearty, and-- -Stop it.

292
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,090
他很清楚出来混，迟早要还的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He knew what he was doing. Those are the chances we take.

293
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,300
他成家了没？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Was he married?

294
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,230
他保了1万块的险，膝下无子 一个不喜欢他的太太
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, with 10,000 insurance, no children and a wife that didn't like him.

295
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,730
- 请别…- 本来就是这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Please don't. -That's the way it was.

296
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,800
现在没时间去担心那个了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anyway, there's no time for worrying about that now.

297
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,930
外面有一大群警察和副地方检察官…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Out there's a flock of policemen and assistant district attorneys...

298
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,930
出动，鼻子在地上嗅
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...running around with their noses to the ground.

299
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,270
他们知道我吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mr. Spade, do they know about me?

300
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,080
还不知道，见到你以前我一直在敷衍他们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not yet. I've been stalling them until I could see you.

301
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,420
他们非得知道不可吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do they have to know?

302
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,480
你就不能隐瞒我吗？这样我就不会被盘问
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can't you shield me so I won't have to answer their questions?

303
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,290
如果我知道真相的话 也许还做得到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe, but I gotta know what it's all about.

304
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,580
我不能告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't tell you.

305
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,360
现在不能告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't tell you now.

306
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,150
等到可以时，我会跟你讲的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I will later, when I can.

307
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,560
请你信任我，史派特先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've got to trust me, Mr. Spade.

308
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,540
我很孤单和害怕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I'm so alone and afraid.

309
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,490
如果你不帮我的话，就没人能帮我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've got nobody to help me if you won't help me.

310
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,440
请你慷慨一点吧，史派特先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Be generous, Mr. Spade.

311
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,910
你很勇敢，还很坚强
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're brave. You're strong.

312
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,860
你可以给我些勇气和力量，我肯定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can spare me some of that courage and strength, surely.

313
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,310
帮我，我真的很需要你的帮忙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Help me, Mr. Spade. I need help so badly.

314
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,740
我没权力求你，但我还是求了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have no right to ask you. I know I haven't, but I do ask you.

315
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,050
帮我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Help me.

316
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,740
你不需要什么帮忙，你很厉害了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You won't need much of anybody's help. You're good.

317
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,090
都是你的眼神，还有你那悸动的声音
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's chiefly your eyes, I think, and that throb you get in your voice...

318
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,260
你说“请你慷慨一点吧，史派特先生”时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...when you say things like, "Be generous, Mr. Spade."

319
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,850
我活该
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I deserve that.

320
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,890
我讲话方式挺虚假的 但我讲的事是真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But the lie was in the way I said it, not at all in what I said.

321
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,460
如果你不信任我的话，都是我的错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's my own fault if you can't believe me now.

322
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,860
你现在变得很危险哦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now you are dangerous.

323
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,270
我恐怕帮不上你的忙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I'm not going to be able to be of much help to you...

324
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,240
除非我知道真相
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...unless I've got some idea what it's all about.

325
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,770
我需要你那佛洛德?德斯派的一些线索
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For instance, I've gotta have some sort of a line on your Floyd Thursby.

326
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,240
我们是在东方认识的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I met him in the Orient.

327
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,070
上个礼拜我们从香港飞到这里 他本来答应要帮我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We came here from Hong Kong last week. He promised to help me.

328
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,570
但他却利用我的无依无靠背叛了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He took advantage of my dependence to betray me.

329
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,680
背叛你？那你为什么还找人跟踪他？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Betray you? How? Why did you want him shadowed?

330
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,820
这样我才能了解他到了 哪一步，在见谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wanted to find out how far he'd gone, whom he was meeting, things like that.

331
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,020
- 阿尔契是他杀的吗？- 肯定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Did he kill Archer? -Certainly.

332
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,360
他有一把鲁格尔手枪 阿契尔不是被鲁格尔枪杀的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He had a Luger in his shoulder holster. Archer wasn't shot with a Luger.

333
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,930
你不会是以为是我干的吧？！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mr. Spade, you don't think I had anything to do with the death of Mr. Archer?

334
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,500
- 是你吗？- 当然不是！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Did you? -No.

335
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,830
很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's good.

336
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,800
佛洛德常会多带一把左轮手枪在外套口袋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Floyd always carried an extra revolver in his overcoat pocket.

337
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,600
干嘛老带枪？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why all the guns?

338
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,150
他是靠枪吃饭
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He lived by them.

339
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,610
他第一次去香港时，就是当一个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The story is that he first came to the Orient...

340
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,520
不得不离开美国的赌客的保镖的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...as bodyguard to a gambler who'd had to leave the States.

341
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,180
赌客从此失踪，佛洛知道了…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The gambler had disappeared. Floyd knew about the disappearance.

342
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,550
我不晓得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know.

343
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,220
我只知道总会全副武装，他睡觉时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I do know he always went heavily armed, and that he never went to sleep...

344
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,480
床周围地板上总是铺着弄皱的报纸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...without covering the floor around his bed with crumpled newspapers...

345
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,080
这样就没人能静悄悄的走进他的房间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...so that nobody could come silently into his room.

346
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,990
你挑了一个不错的玩伴哦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You picked a nice sort of a playmate.

347
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,130
他本来是能帮上我的忙的，如果他够忠诚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Only that sort could have helped me, if he'd been loyal.

348
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,150
- 你的情况有多糟？- 要多糟有多糟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-How bad a spot are you actually in? -Bad as could be.

349
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,530
生命有危险？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Physical danger?

350
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,130
我可不是什么英雄，死最糟了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not heroic. I don't think there's anything worse than death.

351
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,870
- 就这样了？- 就这样了，真的和我们就坐在这里一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Then it's that? -It's that, as surely as we're sitting here.

352
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,870
除非你帮我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Unless you help me.

353
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,560
德斯派是谁杀的？是你的还是他的敌人？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who killed Thursby, your enemies or his?

354
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,560
不晓得…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know.

355
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,370
我想是他的敌人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}His, I suppose.

356
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,810
我很害怕，不晓得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm afraid. I don't know.

357
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,410
根本无望，我不晓得你想怎样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is hopeless. I don't know what you want done.

358
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,150
甚至不晓得你知不知道要怎样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I don't even know if you know.

359
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,320
你不会去报警吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You won't go to the police?

360
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,250
报警？我只要站直了他们就会蜂拥而至
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Go to them? All I gotta do is stand still, they'll be all over me.

361
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,100
好啦，我会告诉他们我知道的 你必须冒险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll tell them all I know, and you'll take your chances.

362
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,590
你很有耐性，你想帮我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've been patient with me. You've tried to help me.

363
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,590
没用的吧，我想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's useless and hopeless, I suppose.

364
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:36,630
谢谢你，我会冒自己的险的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I do thank you for what you've done. I'll have to take my chances.

365
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,090
- 你有多少钱？- 我剩下5百块
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How much money have you got? I've got about $500 left.

366
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,480
给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Give it to me.

367
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,150
- 这里只有4百块 - 我还得生活
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-There's only $400 here. -I had to keep some to live on.

368
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,790
- 筹得到钱吗？- 不行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Well, can't you get some more? -No.

369
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,920
没东西可换钱吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Got anything you can raise some money on?

370
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,670
- 我有貂皮大衣和珠宝 - 当掉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I've got some furs and a little jewelry. -You'll have to hock them.

371
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,070
给你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There you are.

372
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,740
我马上回来，带最好的消息给你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll be back as soon as I can with the best news I can manage.

373
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,150
我会按四声门铃… 长…短…长…短…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll ring four times. Long, short, long, short.

374
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,940
你不用去开门，我自己会进来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And no, you needn't bother to come to the door. I'll let myself in.

375
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,190
有好消息吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anything stirring?

376
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,720
花是你送来的吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did you send the flowers?

377
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,690
你真是无价之宝，亲爱的 帮我接律师，好吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're invaluable, darling. Say, get my lawyer on the phone, will you?

378
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,470
喂，锡德？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello, Sid?

379
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,780
我要让一个验尸官去死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think I'm going to have to tell a coroner to go to blazes, Sid.

380
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,350
我可不可以像牧师或律师那样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can I hide behind the sanctity of my client's identity...

381
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,720
保留客户的神圣秘密？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...secrets and what-nots all the same, priest or lawyer?

382
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,080
我知道，但邓迪变得有点粗暴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, but Dundy's getting rambunctious

383
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,180
这次有点过分
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and maybe it is a bit thick this time.

384
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,960
站在安全这一边要付出多少代价？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. What'll it cost to be on the safe side?

385
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,760
好吧，也许值得，就这么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, maybe it's worth it. Okay, go ahead.

386
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,490
栀子花
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Gardenia.

387
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,400
快，亲爱的，带他进来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Quick, darling, in with him.

388
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,530
进来吧，开罗先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Will you come in, Mr. Cairo?

389
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,170
请坐，开罗先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Will you sit down, Mr. Cairo?

390
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,970
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you, sir.

391
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,350
有何贵干，开罗先生？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, what can I do for you, Mr. Cairo?

392
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,650
身为一名陌生人 我可不可以向你搭档的意外致哀？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}May a stranger offer condolences for your partner's unfortunate death?

393
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,190
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thanks.

394
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,390
情况正如报纸暗示的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is there, Mr. Spade, as the newspapers imply...

395
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,320
那件不幸事件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...a certain relationship between that unfortunate happening...

396
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,490
真的跟稍后德斯派的死有关吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and the death a little later of the man Thursby?

397
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,680
很抱歉，无关！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I beg your pardon. No.

398
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,870
我不是闲得无聊问这个问题的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}More than idle curiosity prompted my question.

399
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,840
这样讲好了，史派特先生，我在找
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}See, Mr. Spade, I'm trying to recover...

400
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,780
一件饰品，就说它遗失了好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...an ornament that, shall we say, has been mislaid.

401
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,010
我想…也希望你能帮我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Uh-huh. -I thought and hoped you could assist me.

402
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,010
那件饰品是一尊雕像
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The ornament is a statuette.

403
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,980
一只黑鸟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A black figure of a bird.

404
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,010
我谨代表物主
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am prepared to pay, on behalf of the figure's rightful owner...

405
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,810
打算高价找回它，酬劳是5千块
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...the sum of $5,000 for its recovery.

406
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,160
我答应…那句话是怎么讲的？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am prepared to promise that-- What is the phrase?

407
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,830
不问任何问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No questions will be asked.

408
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,030
5千块不算少
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}$5,000 is a lot of money.

409
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,300
什么，爱菲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, Effie?

410
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,510
不，行了，出去时候锁好门就行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, that'll be all. Just be sure to lock the door behind you on your way out.

411
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,810
晚安
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Good night.

412
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,930
5千块很…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}$5,000 is--

413
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,640
手放在脖子后面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Clasp your hands together at the back of your neck.

414
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,610
我要搜你的办公室，史派特先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I intend to search your offices, Mr. Spade.

415
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:12,080
我警告你哦 如果你想阻止我，我会开枪哦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I warn you, if you attempt to prevent me, I shall certainly shoot you.

416
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,280
搜吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Go ahead and search.

417
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,190
麻烦你到中间来一下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Will you please come to the center of the room?

418
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,450
我要确定你没配枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I have to make certain that you are not armed.

419
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,590
护照：乔伊?开罗

420
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,180
法国护照

421
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,770
你看看你，把我衣服搞成这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look what you did to my shirt.

422
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,000
很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry.

423
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,240
但请你想一下 我发现5千块是骗人的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But imagine my embarrassment when I found out that $5,000 offer...

424
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,400
我多狼狈啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-...was just hooey.

425
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,740
我讲的是真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Mr. Spade, my offer is genuine.

426
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,570
我会付你5千块，如果找得到它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am prepared to pay $5,000 for the figure's return.

427
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,410
- 在你手上吗？- 没
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Do you have it? -No.

428
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,920
如果没有的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But if it isn't here...

429
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,040
干嘛还要冒受伤的险阻止我搜查
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...why did you risk injury to prevent my searching for it?

430
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,210
我能让别人随便在我这里撒野吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why should I sit around here and let people come in and stick me up?

431
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,560
如果可以的话，帮物主省点钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But certainly it is only natural that I try to save the owner...

432
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,790
是很自然的一件事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...such a considerable expense, if possible.

433
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,060
谁？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who is he?

434
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,660
很抱歉，我不能回答你这个问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mr. Spade, you'll forgive my not answering that question.

435
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,900
我们最好看看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I think we'd be better off all around

436
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,410
大家的牌是不是都在桌子上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if we'd put our cards on the table.

437
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,030
最好不要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I do not think it would be better.

438
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,200
这样讲好了，如果你知道的比我还多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You see, Mr. Spade, if you know more than I do...

439
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,340
我会因此而得利
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...then I shall profit by your knowledge.

440
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,300
所以，就到5千块的程度吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So will you, to the extent of $5,000.

441
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,680
好像没看到5千块啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, there's nothing like $5,000 here.

442
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,580
原来你希望我的诚恳要有某程度的保证
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, you want some assurance of my sincerity?

443
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,980
- 一点聘金？怎么样？- 可以
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-A retainer? Would that do? -It might.

444
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,040
你就先拿…1百块，怎样？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You will take, say, $100?

445
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,460
不…我要…两百块
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. I will take, say, $200.

446
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,580
你的第一个猜测是那只鸟在我手上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's see, your first guess was that I had the bird.

447
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,680
答案是不在我手上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's nothing to that.

448
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,220
你的第二个猜测是什么？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's your second guess?

449
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,360
你知道在哪里或者至少拿回来的方法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That you know where it is, or at least you know it is where you can get it.

450
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,960
你不是请我来杀人越货
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're not hiring me to do any murders or burglaries...

451
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,370
而是在合法的情况下把它找回来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but simply to get it back if possible, in an honest, lawful way?

452
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,660
如果可以的话当然最好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If possible.

453
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,870
但你自己决定就好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But in any case, with discretion.

454
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,700
如果你想联络我的话 我住在了望楼旅馆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When you wish to contact me, sir, I'm staying at the Hotel Belvedere.

455
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,050
635室
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Room 635.

456
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,040
我诚恳希望能合作愉快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I sincerely expect the greatest mutual benefit...

457
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,650
互惠互利，史派特先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...from our association, Mr. Spade.

458
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,350
枪可以还我了吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, may I please have my gun, now?

459
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,880
当然，我全忘光了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, sure. I'd forgotten all about it.

460
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,190
请你把手放在脖子后面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Will you please clasp your hands together at the back of your neck?

461
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,430
我要搜你的办公室
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I intend to search your offices.

462
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,870
要不，我会…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I'll be.

463
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,560
好啊…搜吧…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why, sure.

464
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,390
我不会阻止你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Go ahead. I won't stop you.

465
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,210
右转，开上山，司机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Turn to the right and go up the hill, driver. -Okay.

466
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,540
史派特先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mr. Spade.

467
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,850
你有没有什么消息？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you bring any news?

468
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,040
你有没有搞定，让警方不知道我？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did you manage it so that the police won't have to know about me?

469
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,850
一段时间内他们是不会知道的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, they won't for a while, anyway.

470
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,520
你太棒了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are wonderful.

471
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,750
你不会有麻烦吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You won't get into any trouble, will you?

472
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,560
某个程度内的麻烦也不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}SPADE: I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble.

473
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,290
请坐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do sit down.

474
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,760
你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You, uh....

475
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,570
你不是你假装的那种人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You aren't exactly the sort of a person you pretend to be, are you?

476
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,380
我不大明白你的意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why, I'm not sure I know exactly what you mean.

477
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,180
小女生的态度，你知道的 忸怩、吞吞吐吐什么的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The schoolgirl manner. You know, blushing, stammering and all that.

478
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,610
我没过过好生活，我过得很糟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I haven't lived a good life. I've been bad.

479
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,650
比你想像的还要糟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Worse than you could know.

480
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,950
很好，因为如果你真的就像自己装的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's good, because if you actually were as innocent as you pretend to be...

481
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,820
那么无辜的话 我们就不会有什么发展
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...we'd never get anywhere.

482
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,230
我不会再扮天真了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I won't be innocent.

483
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,430
很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Good.

484
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:23,250
对了，今晚我见过乔伊?开罗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, by the way, I saw Joel Cairo tonight.

485
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,370
- 你认识他吗？ - 点头之交
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Do you know him? -Only slightly.

486
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,790
你行啊，真行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're good. You're very good.

487
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,530
- 他怎么说？- 说什么？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What did he say? -About what?

488
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,330
- 说我 - 没什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-About me. -Nothing.

489
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,760
- 那你们说什么了？- 他想付我5千块找回那只黑鸟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What did you talk about then? -He offered me $5,000 for the black bird.

490
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,540
你不会是又想去走过去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're not gonna go around straightening things

491
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,740
拨火吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and poking the fire again, are you?

492
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,140
当然不是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I'm not.

493
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,280
- 你怎么说？- 我说5千块不算少
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What did you say? -I said $5,000 was a lot of money.

494
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,510
那是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It is.

495
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,810
比我付你的还多 如果我得争取你的忠诚的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's more than I can ever offer you if I have to bid for your loyalty.

496
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,910
你说得很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's good coming from you.

497
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,080
除了钱外，你还给了我什么？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What have you ever given me beside money?

498
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,220
你给过我信任和真相吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You ever given me any of your confidence, any of the truth?

499
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,790
你不就是用钱来买我的忠诚吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Haven't you tried to buy my loyalty with money and nothing else?

500
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,290
我还有什么能付出的？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What else is there I can buy you with?

501
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,370
我不管你的秘密是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't care what your secrets are...

502
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,660
但如果我对你没有更多信心就不行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but I can't go ahead without more confidence in you than I've got now.

503
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,640
你得说服我是怎么回事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've got to convince me that you aren't fiddling around...

504
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,100
你不是在瞎混，等着天上掉馅饼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...hoping it'll all come out right in the end.

505
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,290
你就不能再信任我久点吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Can't you trust me a little longer?

506
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,690
久点是多久？你还在等什么呢？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What are you waiting for?

507
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,420
我必须找乔伊?开罗谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've got to talk to Joel Cairo.

508
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,850
今晚你可以去找他 他会去看戏，很快要停演了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can see him tonight. He's at the theater. It'll be out soon.

509
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,950
- 我会在他的旅馆里留言 - 他不能来这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I'll leave a message at his hotel. -He can't come here.

510
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,130
我不能让他知道我在哪里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't let him know where I am. I'm afraid.

511
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,690
那就去我那里好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My place, then.

512
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,800
喂？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello?

513
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,330
- 我想留言给乔伊?开罗 - 好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I want to leave a message for Joel Cairo. -All right.

514
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,180
如果我无法完全信任你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I never would've placed myself in this position

515
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,130
我就不会让自己处于这个境地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if I didn't trust you completely.

516
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,560
又来了？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That again?

517
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,550
这是真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you know that's true, though?

518
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,170
你不必这么辛苦，设法说服我信任你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't have to trust me, so long as you can persuade me to trust you.

519
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,440
不必再担心这件事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But don't worry about that now.

520
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,400
他随时会到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He'll be along any minute.

521
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,410
解决掉你跟开罗的事 然后我们的情况就会明朗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You get your business with Cairo over with, then we'll see how we stand.

522
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,610
你会让我用自己的方法处理他？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And you'll let me go about it with him in my own way?

523
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,880
当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}SPADE:
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, sure.

524
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,320
你简直就是上帝的恩赐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are a godsend.

525
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,080
不要做得太过火
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, now don't overdo it.

526
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:35,940
史派特先生，外面有人在监视
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mr. Spade, there is a boy outside. He seems to be watching the house.

527
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,360
我知道，我看到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, I know. I spotted him.

528
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,420
怎样？什么监不监视的？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What? What's that? What boy?

529
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,060
有个年青人一直在跟踪我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know. A kid. He's been trailing me all evening.

530
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,230
- 他有没有一直跟踪你到我公寓？- 我早把他甩掉了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Did he follow you to my apartment? -I shook him long before that.

531
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,040
进来吧，开罗先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come in, Mr. Cairo.

532
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,910
- 很高兴再见到你，夫人 - 我想你也是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I'm delighted to see you again, madam. -I was sure you would be, Joel.

533
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,110
史派特先生跟我提过你关于鹰的提议
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mr. Spade told me about your offer for the falcon.

534
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,460
- 钱你多快能筹得到？- 钱已经准备好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-How soon can you have the money? -The money is ready.

535
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,790
- 现金？- 是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}O'SHAUGHNESSY: In cash? -Oh, yes.

536
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,820
你真的愿意付5千块找回那只鹰？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're ready to pay $5,000 if we turn over the falcon to you?

537
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,790
抱歉！我一定是没有把意思讲清楚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Excuse me, please. I must have expressed myself badly.

538
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,460
钱不在我的口袋里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I did not mean to say that I have the money in my pocket...

539
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,560
银行上班时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but I am ready to get it for you on a minute's notice...

540
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,400
我随时可以提
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...anytime during banking hours.

541
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,100
也许是吧，我下午在办公室搜他时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's probably true. He only had a couple of hundred...

542
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,730
他身上有几百块
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...when I searched him this afternoon at my office.

543
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:30,510
我会把钱送过来的，早上十点半？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I shall be able to have the money for you at, say, half past 10 in the morning.

544
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,670
我还没拿到鹰呢！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I haven't got the falcon.

545
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,050
再给我一个礼拜吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll have it in another week at the most, though.

546
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,710
到底在哪里？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then where is it?

547
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,750
- 佛洛德藏起来了 - 佛洛德藏…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Where Floyd hid it. -Floyd hid....

548
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,230
你知道在哪里吗？干嘛还要等一个礼拜？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And you know where he hid it? Then why do we have to wait a week?

549
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,780
也许不必一整个礼拜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, perhaps not a whole week.

550
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,850
再问个问题，为什么你会愿意卖给我？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And why, if I may ask another question, are you willing to sell it to me?

551
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,390
佛洛德发生那些事后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Because I'm afraid. After what happened to Floyd...

552
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,890
我很怕碰它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...I'm afraid to touch it,

553
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,500
只想摆脱它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}except to turn it over to somebody.

554
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,770
佛洛德怎么了？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What exactly did happen to Floyd?

555
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,670
那个胖男人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The fat man.

556
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,440
那个胖男人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fat man.

557
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,700
- 他在这里？ - 我想是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Is he here? O'SHAUGHNESSY: I don't know.

558
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,600
有什么差别？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I suppose so. What difference does it make?

559
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,850
差别可大了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It might make a world of difference.

560
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,120
对你还是对我？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Or you or me.

561
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,280
要不要处理掉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Precisely. But, shall we add,

562
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,890
外面那家伙？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}more certainly the boy outside?

563
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,380
好，但你应该能很好的处理掉他，乔伊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes. But you might be able to get around him, Joel...

564
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,380
就像伊斯坦布尔那一回
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...as you did the one in Istanbul.

565
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,130
他叫什么名字来着？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What was his name?

566
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,170
你是指那个你无法…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You mean the one you couldn't get to come to--

567
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,770
这是你第二次攻击我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is the second time that you have laid hands on me.

568
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,550
你挨抽的时候就受着吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it.

569
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,380
那是谁？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who's that?

570
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,410
不晓得，安静
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know. Keep quiet.

571
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,550
你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}SPADE: Hello.

572
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,780
你们可真会挑时间上门啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You guys pick swell hours to do your visiting in.

573
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,120
- 几点啦？- 我们要事找你聊，史派特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What is it? -We want to talk to you, Spade.

574
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,360
那就说吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Go ahead and talk.

575
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,050
不会让我们站在走廊说吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-We don't have to do it in the hall, do we?

576
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,190
- 你们不能进来 - 别瞎掰了，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You can't come in. -Oh, come off it now, Sam.

577
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,720
你不会是想暴力相向吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You aren't trying to strong-arm me, are you, Tom?

578
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,290
讲点道理啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why don't you be reasonable?

579
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,460
跟我们玩你会付出代价的，史派德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It would pay you to play along with us.

580
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,100
你逃得过初一
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You got away with this and that...

581
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,810
逃不过十五
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but you can't keep it up.

582
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,750
- 行的时候就阻止我 - 我很想这么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Stop me when you can. -That's what I intend to do.

583
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,200
有关于你和阿契尔妻子的闲言碎语
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's talk going around about you and Archer's wife.

584
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,440
- 有这回事吗？- 无稽之谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Is there anything to it? -Not a thing.

585
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,470
谣言说，阿契尔的太太很想离婚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The talk is she tried to get a divorce

586
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,750
这样才能跟你在一起，他不想离
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so she could put in with you. He wouldn't give it.

587
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,190
- 有这回事吗？- 没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Anything to that? -No.

588
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,320
谣言说，这就是他被杀的原因
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's talk that that's why he was put on the spot.

589
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,010
别太贪了，邓迪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't be a hog, Dundy.

590
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,820
如果你觉得是我杀了麦尔斯的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your idea that I killed Thursby because he killed Miles...

591
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,260
那么你起初怀疑我为了麦尔斯 而杀德斯派的假设就不攻而破了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...falls to pieces if you blame me for killing Miles.

592
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,380
我没说过你杀了任何人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You haven't heard me say you killed anybody.

593
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,830
你倒是老提这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You're the one bringing that up.

594
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,560
除了老到我这里来 你们就没别的事可干了吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Haven't you anything better to do than to keep popping in here every morning,

595
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,010
老是一大早来问堆蠢问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}asking fool questions?

596
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,130
- 还想要得到假答案 - 不要冲动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-And getting a lot of lying answers. -Take it easy.

597
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,190
如果你说跟阿契尔太太之间是清白的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you say there's nothing between you and Archer's wife,

598
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,000
那你就是撒谎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you're a liar.

599
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,670
这就是你们会大半夜登门来找我的线索？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is that the hot tip that brought you up here at this ungodly hour?

600
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,970
这是其中之一
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-That's one of them.

601
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,480
其它的呢？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-And the other?

602
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,210
让我们进去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let us in.

603
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,070
好吧，史派特，我们走就是了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, Spade, we'll go.

604
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,410
也许你顶撞我们是对的 再考虑看看吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe you're right in bucking us. Think it over.

605
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,290
救命啊！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}[THUDDING]CAIRO: Help!

606
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,450
- 看来我们得进去了 - 我猜是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I guess we're going in. -I guess you are.

607
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,660
怎么回事啊？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}DUNDY: What's going on in here?

608
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,190
警官！看看她干了什么好事！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}CAIRO: Look. Look, officer. Look what she did.

609
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,950
- 你干的？- 不得不这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Did you do that? O'SHAUGHNESSY: I had to.

610
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,090
我和他独处，他想袭击我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was alone with him. He tried to attack me.

611
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,160
我得让他走开，但我没办法朝他开枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I couldn't bring myself to shoot him.

612
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,230
你这个肮脏的大骗子！你…不是这样的！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You dirty, filthy liar, you. It isn't true.

613
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,270
我来这里没恶意，他们俩攻击我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I came up here in good faith, and then both of them attacked me.

614
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,880
他出去和你们讲话时 留她和一把手枪在这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And then when he went out to talk to you, he left her here with a pistol.

615
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,310
她说你们一走，他们就会杀了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She said as soon as you leave, they are going to kill me...

616
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,740
我才会喊救命 因为我不想你们让我被谋杀
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...so I called for help because I didn't want you to leave.

617
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,020
她用手枪敲我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And then she struck me with a pistol.

618
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,390
为什么不逼他讲真话！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}O'SHAUGHNESSY: Why don't you make him tell the truth?

619
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,450
注意你的行为，大姐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}CAIRO: Look. Look what she.... -Behave yourself, sister.

620
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,960
别演戏了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's no way to act.

621
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,690
看来我们得带大队人马来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't guess we'll be wrong running the lot of them in.

622
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,280
别急，年青人，一切都好解释
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't be in a hurry. Everything can be explained.

623
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,480
我敢打赌
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll bet.

624
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,930
这位是奥夏克尼希小姐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miss O'Shaughnessy, may I present

625
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,490
邓迪警探，柏郝斯警探
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Lieutenant Dundy and Detective Polhaus?

626
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,360
奥夏克尼希小姐昨天起是我的手下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miss O'Shaughnessy is an operative in my employ since yesterday.

627
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,570
骗人！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's a lie too.

628
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,260
那是乔伊?开罗先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That is Mr. Joel Cairo.

629
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,580
开罗跟德斯派很熟 他今天下午来我办公室
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Cairo was an acquaintance of Thursby's. He came into my office late this afternoon...

630
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,330
他雇我找东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...hired me to find something that

631
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,640
德斯派被杀时东西在他手上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thursby was supposed to have on him.

632
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,040
他说话方式很滑稽，所以我没接手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It looked funny to me the way he put it, so I wouldn't touch it.

633
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,150
他用枪指着我，但这没有关系
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then he pulled a gun on me. Well, that's neither here nor there...

634
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,380
除非我们相互指控
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...unless we start preferring charges against each other.

635
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,650
奥夏克尼希小姐和我讨论情况
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miss O'Shaughnessy and I discussed the matter...

636
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,210
决定了解他知道多少
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and decided to find out how much he knew...

637
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,110
麦尔斯和德斯派被杀的内情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...about Miles' and Thursby's killings,

638
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,130
所以我们请他上来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so we asked him to come up here.

639
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,620
可能我们询问的时候的确粗暴了点儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, maybe we did put the questions to him a little roughly.

640
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,890
你是了解状况的，警探
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know how that is, lieutenant.

641
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,800
但我们还没有把他伤到要喊救命
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But we didn't hurt him enough to make him cry for help.

642
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,860
- 你想解释什么的吗？- 不知道该说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What have you got to say to that? -I don't know what to say.

643
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,340
说实话吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Try telling the facts.

644
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,370
- 实话？ - 罗罗嗦嗦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What? Facts? -Oh, quit stalling.

645
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,210
你只需发誓说他们打了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All you have to do is swear out a complaint

646
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,610
我就把他们扔进号子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I'll throw them in the can.

647
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,670
说啊，开罗，告诉他，他会这样的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Go ahead, Cairo. Tell him, he'll do it.

648
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,600
然后我们再发誓指控你 他就把我们都抓住了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then we'll swear out a complaint against you, and he'll have the lot of us.

649
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,210
去把帽子戴好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Get your hats.

650
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,650
姑娘小伙子们，我们好好解决下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, boys and girls, we put it over nicely.

651
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,980
去，拿你的帽子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Go on, get your hats.

652
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,850
你不知道自己被耍笑了？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Don't you know when you're being kidded?

653
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,290
不，我们等到了局子再说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, but that can wait till we get down to the hall.

654
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,810
醒醒吧，邓迪，你被耍笑了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wake up, Dundy, you're being kidded.

655
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,760
一听到警笛，我就对他们两位说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When I heard the buzzer, I said to Miss O'Shaughnessy and Cairo:

656
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,960
警察又来了，他们还真是讨厌
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}"There's the police. They're getting to be a nuisance.

657
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,520
听到他们来，你们中的一个就叫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When you hear them going, scream.

658
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,600
然后看把他们耍得团团转能耍多久
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We'll see how far we can string them until they tumble."

659
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,160
住嘴，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Stop it, Sam.

660
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,370
他头上是怎么受伤的？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That cut on his head. How did that get there?

661
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,490
- 问他啊，也许是刮胡子时受的伤 - 伤口？不是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Ask him. Maybe he cut himself shaving. -The cut? No.

662
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,900
我们装着抢手枪 我摔在地毯上，摔的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When we pretended to be struggling for the gun, I fell over the carpet. I fell.

663
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,260
胡说八道！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Horsefeathers.

664
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,080
把他带走，非法持枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Take him along, anyway, for packing a gun.

665
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,640
别傻了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't be a sap.

666
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,680
那枪是个局，枪是我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That gun was a plant. It was one of mine.

667
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,740
可惜，只是点25，要不你就得证明
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Too bad it was only a .25. You could prove that was the gun...

668
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,290
那是凶枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...Miles and Thursby were shot with.

669
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,480
- 不…山姆…不… - 带他走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-No, Sam. No. -Well, then get him out of here.

670
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,500
- 记下他们的名字和地址 - 乔伊?开罗，了望楼旅馆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Get their names and addresses. -My name is Joel Cairo, Hotel Belvedere.

671
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,280
奥夏克尼希小姐的地址就是我的办公室
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miss O'Shaughnessy's address is my office.

672
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,320
- 你住哪？ - 让他走！我受够了！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Where do you live? -Get him out of here.

673
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,960
放松，山姆，这是你想要的，警探？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Take it easy, will you? Is that all you want?

674
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,480
我要走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Yeah. -I think I'll be going now.

675
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,970
干嘛那么急？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's the hurry, Cairo?

676
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,130
不是着急，太晚了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There is no hurry. It's getting quite late, and....

677
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,590
跟他讲不要带走手枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell him to leave the gun.

678
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,710
希望你很清楚自己在干什么，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I hope you know what you're doing, Sam.

679
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:38,620
你是我这辈子所碰过最野 最难以预料的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're absolutely the wildest, most unpredictable person I've ever known.

680
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,280
你总是这么横吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you always carry on so high-handed?

681
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,500
你已经跟开罗谈过了嘛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, you've had your talk with Cairo.

682
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,630
现在你可以跟我谈！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now you can talk to me.

683
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,900
当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yes, of course.

684
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,670
我在听
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm listening.

685
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,490
我还在听
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm still listening.

686
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:58,900
- 看时间，我该走了 - 不行，统统告诉我了再走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Oh, look at the time. I must be going. -Oh, no. Not till you've told me all about it.

687
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,600
我是囚犯吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Am I a prisoner?

688
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,540
也许外面那家伙还没回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe the boy outside hasn't gone home yet.

689
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,240
他还在那里？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you suppose he's still there?

690
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,540
可能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Likely.

691
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,150
开始说吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can start now.

692
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,280
你这家伙太固执了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are the most insistent person.

693
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,930
不但野而且还很难预料，不是吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And wild and unpredictable, huh?

694
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:25,580
这只鸟…这只鹰怎么回事？ 为什么大家这么热衷？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Say, what's this bird, this falcon that everybody's all steamed up about?

695
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,160
如果我什么都不跟你讲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Supposing I wouldn't tell you anything about it at all?

696
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,360
你会怎样？干撒野和难以预料的事？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What would you do? Something wild and unpredictable?

697
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,960
可能喔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I might.

698
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,940
那是一个黑色雕塑，光滑、闪亮…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's a black figure, as you know, smooth and shiny...

699
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,740
那是一只鸟、鹰，大约这么高
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...of a bird, a hawk or falcon, about that high.

700
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,110
我来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, here.

701
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,480
- 它为什么这么重要？- 不晓得，他们不告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What--? What makes it so important? -I don't know. They wouldn't tell me.

702
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:52,140
他们付我5百块，如果我能从持有的那个人那里找回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They offered me ￡500 if I'd help them get it away from the man who had it.

703
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,750
在伊斯坦布尔？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That was in Istanbul?

704
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,060
马尔马拉海
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Marmara.

705
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,950
继续说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Go ahead.

706
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,520
就这样了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But that's all.

707
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,430
他们答应，帮他们的话付我5百，我就来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They promised me ￡500 if I'd help them, and I did.

708
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,220
我们发现乔伊想背弃我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then we found out that Joel Cairo intended to desert us...

709
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,440
独吞那只鹰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...taking the falcon with him and leaving Floyd and me nothing.

710
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,610
所以我们就那样对付他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So we did exactly that to him.

711
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:14,370
但情况一点没好转
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then I wasn't any better off than before.

712
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,830
因为佛洛德也不打算信守诺言
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Floyd hadn't any intention of keeping his promise...

713
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:20,040
平分，我们到这里后我才了解的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...about sharing. I learned that by the time we got here.

714
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,840
那只鸟什么材质？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's the bird made of?

715
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,650
瓷或者黑石…不晓得 我只看过一次，而且只几分钟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Porcelain or black stone. I don't know. I only saw it for a few minutes.

716
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,440
我们第一次拿到的时候佛洛德给我看过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Floyd showed it to me when we first got hold of it.

717
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,010
你撒谎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are a liar.

718
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,320
没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am.

719
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,960
我一直在撒谎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've always been a liar.

720
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,880
别自吹自擂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't brag about it.

721
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,960
这奇谈里有没有什么值得相信的？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Was there any truth at all in that yarn?

722
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,530
一些些
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Some.

723
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,660
不多就是了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not very much.

724
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:50,370
我们有的是时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, we got all night.

725
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,200
咖啡马上准备好，喝了咖啡重新再来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Coffee'll be ready soon. We'll have a cup and try again.

726
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,070
我很累了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I'm so tired.

727
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,630
厌倦了撒谎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So tired of lying and making up lies.

728
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,640
我已经分不清哪些是谎言 哪些是真话了，我希望…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not knowing what is a lie and what's the truth. I wish....

729
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:30,030
我要跟开罗先生谈，乔伊?开罗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I want to talk to Mr. Cairo, Joel Cairo.

730
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,040
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh. Thanks.

731
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,050
他在哪里？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Where is he?

732
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,590
- 什么？- 他在哪里？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What? -Where is he?

733
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,650
- 谁啊？- 开罗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Who?
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Cairo.

734
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,220
你想干嘛？逗我玩吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you think you're doing, Jack, kidding me?

735
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,990
我要逗你的时候会告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll tell you when I am.

736
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,850
纽约，不是吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}New York, aren't you?

737
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,160
走开！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shove off.

738
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,770
你必须先开口跟我讲，年青人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're gonna have to talk to me before you're through.

739
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,100
你们有人会的，转告那个胖男人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Some of you will, and you can tell the fat man I said so.

740
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,470
继续问吧，你会得到的，很多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Keep asking for it and you're gonna get it. Plenty.

741
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,980
我叫你走开！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I told you to shove off.

742
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,570
走开！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shove off.

743
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,250
很多人这样讲话没了牙齿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}People lose teeth talking like that.

744
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,910
你想在这里混，就礼貌点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You wanna hang around, you'll be polite.

745
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,580
卢克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Luke.

746
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,320
- 你好，山姆 - 你好，卢克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Hello, Sam. -Hello, Luke.

747
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,820
麦尔斯的事太遗憾了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Say, that was too bad about Miles.

748
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,830
是啊，是个惊天意外
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. It was a tough break.

749
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,790
我有东西给你看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I want to show you something.

750
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,540
你干嘛让这些廉价的枪手在大厅里晃荡
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you let these cheap gunmen hang around for...

751
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,300
他们的铳子都凸出来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...with their heaters bulging in their clothes?

752
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,670
你想干嘛？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you want here?

753
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,340
如果没什么事的话，闪人吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, if you don't want anything, beat it

754
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,050
不要再来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and don't come back.

755
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,150
我不会忘记你们的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I won't forget you guys.

756
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:21,060
- 什么状况？- 不晓得，我刚刚发现他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What is it? -I don't know. I just spotted him.

757
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,200
- 麦尔斯那里怎样？- 回见，卢克
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Say, what about Miles? -I'll see you, Luke.

758
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,570
- 603 - 是，先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Six-oh-three. -Yes, sir.

759
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,070
早安
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Good morning.

760
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,470
- 早安 - 给你，先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Good morning.-There you are.

761
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,210
找个地方聊聊吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's go someplace where we can talk.

762
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,540
不，我可没什么兴趣继续
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Our conversations have not been such that

763
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,170
我们的私下谈话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm anxious to continue them.

764
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,710
原谅我的粗鲁，但事实如此
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Forgive my speaking so bluntly, but it is the truth.

765
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,210
你是指昨晚的事？我能怎么样？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You mean last night?

766
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,180
我必须站在她那边，我不知道鸟在哪里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I had to throw in with her.

767
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,810
你也不知道，只有她知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know where the bird is. She does.

768
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,550
如果我不和她周旋我们怎么搞得到？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How we gonna get it if I don't play along?

769
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:50,280
你总是能自圆其说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You always have a very smooth explanation ready, huh?

770
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,320
难道要我口吃不成？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you want me to do? Learn to stutter?

771
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,060
邓迪带你去警局了？他们盘问了你多久？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Dundy take you to the station? How long they work on you?

772
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,860
直到刚才
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Till a little while ago.

773
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:00,290
- 他们抖落出你什么没有？- 抖落？没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What'd they shake out of you? -Shake out? Not one thing.

774
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:03,430
我坚持你晚上的说辞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I adhered to the course you indicated earlier in your rooms...

775
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,930
但我真希望你编得更像一点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but I certainly wish you would have invented a more reasonable story.

776
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,270
重复那些我自己都觉得蠢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I felt distinctly like an idiot repeating it.

777
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,570
别在意那些胡扯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't worry about the story's goofiness.

778
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:14,300
编得太合理可能害我们都坐牢了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A sensible one would have had us all in the cooler.

779
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,940
- 你确定什么都没讲吗？- 没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You sure you didn't tell them anything? -I did not.

780
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,180
你现在肯定想睡了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, you'll want sleep

781
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,980
如果你整晚都被警察盘问
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if you've been standing up under a police grilling all night.

782
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:23,080
- 回见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}See you later.

783
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,840
- 不，还不行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, not yet.

784
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:29,460
他来后我会请他给你打电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, I'll have him call you the minute he comes in.

785
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:32,080
这是她今天早上的第三通电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's the third time she's called this morning.

786
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,550
- 奥夏克尼希小姐在里面 - 还有呢？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Miss O'Shaughnessy's in there. -Anything else?

787
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,290
区检察官打过电话来，布莱恩想见你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The district attorney's office called. Bryan would like to see you.

788
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:40,160
还有个叫顾德曼的打过电话给你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And a Mr. Gutman called. When I told him you weren't in...

789
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,480
我说你不在，他说：请你转告他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...he said, "Tell him the young man...

790
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,070
那个年青人给我留了口信 我打过电话，还会再打来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...gave me his message, and that I phoned and will phone again?"

791
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:48,970
顾德曼？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Gutman, huh?

792
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,610
谢啦，亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thanks, darling.

793
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,970
亲爱的，有人去过我公寓
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Darling. Somebody's been in my apartment.

794
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:57,850
到处翻得乱七八糟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's all upside down, every which way.

795
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,180
我一换好地方就来这里了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I changed as fast as I could and came right over here.

796
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,970
你肯定是被那家伙跟踪了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You must have let that boy follow you. -No, angel.

797
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:06,290
不，亲爱的，我到你那儿 之前很久就甩掉他了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I shook him off long before I ever went to your place.

798
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:09,020
可能是开罗，他昨晚不在酒店
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It might have been Cairo. He wasn't at the hotel last night.

799
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,320
开罗说，他一整夜都被警察盘问
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He told me he'd been standing up under a police grilling. I wonder.

800
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,280
- 今天早上有没有看到乔伊？- 看到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You saw Joel this morning? -Yeah.

801
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,480
干嘛？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why?

802
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:17,860
因为，我亲爱的，我得跟进各种线索
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Because I've gotta keep in some sort of touch...

803
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:22,390
才能从这一团乱麻中理出头绪来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...with all the loose ends of this dizzy affair if I'm ever gonna make heads or tails of it.

804
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,710
现在我们得给你找个新家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now we've got to find a new home for you.

805
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,640
我不想回去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I won't go back there.

806
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,430
我想到了，等等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I got an idea. Wait a minute.

807
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,470
凭你的女性直觉，你觉得她怎样？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What does your woman's intuition tell you about her?

808
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,580
她还好，也许出这些麻烦是她自找的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's all right. Maybe it's her own fault

809
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,240
但她还好，如果你是这意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}for being in trouble, but she's all right.

810
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,310
我就是这意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you strong enough for her

811
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,450
你有没有能力藏她几天？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to put her up for a few days?

812
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,220
- 你是说在家 - 是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You mean at home? -Yeah.

813
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,090
- 她有危险，山姆？- 是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Is she in any danger, Sam? -I think she is.

814
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,760
会吓死我妈的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Gee, that'd scare Mom into a green hemorrhage.

815
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,950
我得说她是目击证人之类的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd have to say she's a surprise witness

816
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,360
你得一直瞒着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you're keeping undercover.

817
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:55,790
你真体贴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're a darling.

818
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,830
布瑞怡
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, Brigid.

819
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,660
爱菲说她可以收容你住几天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Effie offered to put you up for a few days.

820
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,970
谢谢好意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's very kind.

821
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,170
你们最好动身，从后面出去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'd better start now. Go out the back.

822
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,220
小巷里通常有辆出租停着的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's usually a cab parked there.

823
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,010
在半路桥上下车，确认没人跟踪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Ride partway with her and make sure you're not followed.

824
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,340
最好多换几辆计程车，以确保安全
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Change cabs a couple of times, just to be safe.

825
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,510
我会打电话给妈妈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll give Mom a ring.

826
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,280
等你回去大把时间可以
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's time enough for that when you get back.

827
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,070
待会儿再联络
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll call you later.

828
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,820
喂？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello?

829
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,700
我是山姆?史派特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is Samuel Spade.

830
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:43,760
我的秘书说布莱恩先生要见我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Say, my secretary tells me Mr. Bryan wants to see me.

831
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,970
是的，请问他什么时间最合适
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Ask him what time's most convenient for him.

832
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:51,240
史派特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Spade. S-P-A-D-E.

833
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,040
嗨，甜心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello, honey.

834
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,340
嗯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah.

835
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,610
两点半，好，谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Two-thirty. All right. Thanks.

836
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,710
山姆，请原谅我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, Sam, forgive me. Please forgive me.

837
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,650
是我昨晚叫警察到你那里的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I sent those policemen to your place last night.

838
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:05,890
我被醋意冲昏头了 我打电话叫他们过去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was mad, crazy with jealousy.

839
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:08,420
说会发现麦尔斯谋杀的线索
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I phoned that if they went there they'd learn something about Miles' murder.

840
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,430
- 你怎么会这么想？- 我疯了，山姆，我想伤害你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-What made you think of that? -I was mad. I wanted to hurt you.

841
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,950
你打电话时告诉警察你的身份吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did you tell them who you were?

842
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,330
- 没有，山姆，最亲爱的，我…- 你从哪里打电话的？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-No. Sam, dearest, I--Where'd you phone from?

843
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,160
你街对过的药店
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-The drugstore across from your place.

844
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,790
你最好赶紧回家想一些话来应付警察
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You better hurry home...and think of something to tell the police.

845
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,200
他们会找你的，顺便问下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And by the way...

846
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,960
麦尔斯遇害那晚，你在什么地方？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...where were you the night Miles was murdered?

847
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:26,570
家里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Home.

848
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,470
- 我真的在家！- 没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I was. -No.

849
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:31,380
但我不会追究你的故事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But if that's your story, it's all right with me.

850
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,810
你走吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now you run along.

851
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,350
喂？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello?

852
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,220
我是史派特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, this is Spade.

853
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:50,180
是的，顾德曼先生，我拿到了 一直在等你的消息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yes, Mr. Gutman, I got it. I've been waiting to hear from you.

854
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,820
越快越好，15分钟如何？好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, now. The sooner, the better. Say, 15 minutes? Right.

855
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,190
好，12C
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Twelve-C.

856
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,060
你左边的12C
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Twelve-C to your left, sir.

857
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,510
- 啊，史派特先生- 你好，顾德曼先生？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Mr. Spade. -How do you do, Mr. Gutman?

858
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,040
你开局不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You begin well, sir.

859
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,340
我不相信说“何时”的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I distrust a man who says when.

860
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,740
他得当心酒后失言
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's got to be careful not to drink too much...

861
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,110
因为他这样做的时候，是不被信任的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...because he's not to be trusted when he does.

862
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,340
好吧，先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir...

863
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:50,840
我们就为开诚布公与清楚的沟通干一杯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...here's to plain speaking and clear understanding.

864
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,260
- 你是个守口如瓶的人吗？- 不，我喜欢说话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You're a close-mouthed man? -No, I like to talk.

865
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,480
我越来越欣赏你 我不信任守口如瓶的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Better and better. I distrust a close-mouthed man.

866
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,560
这种人开口的时机通常都会不对，也通常会说错话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He generally picks the wrong time to talk and says the wrong things.

867
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,760
明智的说话并不容易 除非时常练习
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Talking's something you can't do judiciously unless you keep in practice.

868
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:17,610
现在，先生，我们就开说吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, sir. We'll talk, if you like.

869
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,970
直说吧，我喜欢跟爱说话的人说话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll tell you right out. I am a man who likes talking to a man who likes to talk.

870
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,100
很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Swell.

871
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,540
谈谈黑鸟怎么样？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Will we talk about the black bird?

872
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,800
你正合我的胃口
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}[CHUCKLES] You're a man for me, sir.

873
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,510
不会拐弯抹角，说话直截了当
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No beating about the bush. Right to the point.

874
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,880
我们就来谈黑鸟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's talk about the black bird, by all means.

875
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,520
请先回答一个问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But first, answer me a question.

876
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:37,480
你代表奥夏克尼希小姐吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you here as Miss O'Shaughnessy's representative?

877
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,140
并不一定，视情况而定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, there's nothing certain either way. It depends.

878
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,490
看什么情况？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Depends on?

879
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,280
也许要看乔伊?开罗的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe it depends on Joel Cairo.

880
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,450
也许
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe.

881
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:48,660
问题是你代表谁？非此即彼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The question is then which you represent. It'll be one or the other.

882
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,250
我没有这么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't say so.

883
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,220
- 还有谁呢？- 还有我自己
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Who else is there? -There's me.

884
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,840
了不起，先生，了不起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Ah. Ha-ha. That's wonderful, sir, wonderful.

885
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:01,400
我喜欢一个人坦白地表示他为自己着想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I do like a man who tells you right out he's looking out for himself.

886
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,930
我们不都是如此吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't we all?

887
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:05,340
我不信任自称不自私的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't trust a man who says he's not.

888
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,140
让我们来谈黑鸟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh-huh. Now, let's talk about the black bird.

889
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,240
来吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's.

890
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,920
史派特先生，你了不了解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mr. Spade, have you any conception...

891
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,240
那只黑鸟可以弄来多少钱吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...of how much money can be got for that black bird?

892
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:17,500
不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No.

893
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,920
我说个半价，你都会觉得我在骗人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir, if I told you, if I told you half, you'd call me a liar.

894
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:23,750
不会，就算我这么想也不会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, not even if I thought so.

895
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:27,090
你告诉我那是什么 我自己会算出来价码
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But you tell me what it is, and I'll figure out the profit.

896
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,630
你不知道黑鸟是什么？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You mean, you don't know what the bird is?

897
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,150
我知道它什么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I know what it's supposed to look like...

898
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,340
我也知道你们不惜杀人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and I know the value in human life you people put on it.

899
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,560
她没有告诉你那是什么？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She didn't tell you what it is?

900
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,640
- 开罗也没有告诉你？- 他出价1万元
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Cairo didn't, either? -He offered me 10,000 for it.

901
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,940
1万元
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Ten thousand.

902
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,610
是美元，不是英镑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Dollars, mind you, not even pounds.

903
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,260
他们知道黑鸟是什么吗？你的印象是怎样的？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do they know what that bird is, sir? What is your impression?

904
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,770
没什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not much to go by.

905
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,720
开罗没有说他知道，也没说不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Cairo didn't say he did, didn't say he didn't.

906
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:59,090
而她说她不知道，但我认为她在说谎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She said she didn't, but I took it for granted she was lying.

907
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,150
我的判断不是没理由的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not an injudicious thing to do.

908
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,720
如果他们都不知道 那我是全世界唯一知道的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If they don't know, I'm the only one in the whole wide sweet world who does.

909
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,660
告诉了我就只有我们俩知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Swell. When you've told me, that'll make two of us.

910
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:14,130
算术上是正确的 先生，但我不确定是否要告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mathematically correct, sir, but I don't know for certain that I'm going to tell you.

911
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:17,260
别傻了，你知道它是什么 我知道它在哪里，所以我才在这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't be foolish. I know where it is. That's why I'm here.

912
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,100
它在哪里？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir, where is it?

913
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:23,710
我必须告诉你我所知道的，但你却不肯告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You see, I must tell you what I know, but you won't tell me what you know.

914
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,910
太不公平了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's hardly equitable, sir.

915
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,610
不行，不行，我们这样子是无法交易的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, no. I don't think we can do business along those lines.

916
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:31,840
再考虑考虑，而且要快！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, think again, and think fast.

917
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:34,550
我告诉过你的打手 你想搞定这事就得先告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I told that gunsel you'd talk to me before you're through.

918
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,110
我现在告诉你，你要不今天告诉我，要不你自己搞定！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'll talk to me today, or you are through.

919
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,980
不要浪费我的时间！没有你我也可以干
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you wasting my time for? I can get along without you.

920
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,290
还有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And

921
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,690
你在下决心的时候别让那打手靠近我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}keep that gunsel out of my way while you're making up your mind.

922
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,650
我会杀了他！我会杀了他！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll kill him if you don't. I'll kill him.

923
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:48,860
你的性格真是暴力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir, I must say you have a most violent temper.

924
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,230
好好考虑，给你到五点钟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}SPADE:Think it over. You've got till 5:00.

925
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,500
到时候你不是加入就是退出，永远！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then you're either in or out, for keeps.

926
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:22,420
- 谁杀了德斯派？- 我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Who killed Thursby? SPADE: I don't know.

927
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,650
可能你没有，但你可以猜得很准
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Perhaps, but you could make an excellent guess.

928
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,860
我的猜想可能很准，可能毫无价值
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My guess might be excellent or crummy,

929
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:33,780
但史派德养出的小孩可不会笨到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but Mrs. Spade didn't raise any children...

930
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:33,460
在检察官，助理检察官和速记员面前乱猜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...dippy enough to make guesses in front of a district attorney and a stenographer.

931
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,260
你为什么不猜呢？如果你没有什么想隐瞒的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why, if you've nothing to conceal?

932
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:37,230
每个人都有所隐瞒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Everybody has something to conceal.

933
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:40,190
我是宣过誓的执法官，一天24小时都是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm a sworn officer of the law, 24 hours a day...

934
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,810
你没有权利向我隐瞒犯罪证据
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and neither formality nor informality justifies you withholding...

935
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,670
当然除了基于宪法权利之外
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...evidence of crime from me except, of course, on constitutional grounds.

936
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,880
你与警方都指控我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Both you and the police have accused me...

937
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,010
涉及这桩谋杀案
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...of being mixed up in the murders.

938
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:55,320
我和你们俩以前都有过节，在我看来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've had trouble with both of you before, and as far as I can see...

939
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,310
要想洗清你们泼给我的脏水
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...my best chance of clearing myself of the trouble...

940
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,490
我只能自己将凶手绳之以法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...is bringing in the murderers all tied up.

941
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:01,990
如果想抓住凶手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The only chance I've got of tying them up

942
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,800
绳之以法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and bringing them in...

943
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,850
我就必须尽量躲开你与警察
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...is by staying away from you and the police.

944
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,260
你们只会坏事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'd gum up the works.

945
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:09,430
你都记下了，还是我说得太快了吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You getting this all right? Am I going too fast?

946
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,200
- 我都记下来了- 不简单
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, sir. I'm getting it all right.

947
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,340
如果你想告诉委员会我妨碍司法公正
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Good work. If you want to go to the board and tell them I'm obstructing justice...

948
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,560
要求他们撤销我的执照，就快去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and ask them to revoke my license, hop to it.

949
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,440
你们以前试过，结果只换来嘲笑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You tried it before, and it didn't get you anything.

950
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,910
- 你给我听着…- 我不想再进行非正式谈话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Now, look here. -I don't want any more informal talks.

951
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,610
我对你或警察都无话好说 我已经厌倦了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've nothing to say to you, and I'm tired of being called things...

952
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,210
被每个想入非非的公务员呼来唤去，如果想见我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...by every crackpot on the city payroll. So, if you want to see me...

953
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,420
拘留我或者传唤我 我会找律师一起来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...pinch me or subpoena me or something, and I'll come down with my lawyer.

954
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,650
也许我会在审讯时见到你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll see you at the inquest, maybe.

955
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:40,850
来吧，他要见你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on. He wants to see you.

956
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:44,780
我还以为5：25之前你不会来 希望你没有久等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't expect you till 5:25. I hope I haven't kept you waiting.

957
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,360
如果继续嘲弄我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Keep on riding me,

958
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,230
别人就得从你的肝脏找枪子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}they're gonna be picking iron out of your liver.

959
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,460
越低级的混混，越爱装腔作势
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}[SPADE CHUCKLES] The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter, huh?

960
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,220
我们走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, let's go.

961
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:18,060
走啊，这会让你在老板面前受宠的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on. This'll put you in solid with your boss.

962
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:29,090
请进，先生，谢谢你过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come in, sir. Thank you for coming. Come in.

963
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,540
给，你不应该让他带着这些走来走去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You shouldn't let him go around with these on him.

964
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,630
他也许会弄伤自己
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He might get himself hurt.

965
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,610
啊，这是什么？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, well, what's this?

966
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,340
被一个跛脚的报童抢走了 后来又被我抢回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A crippled newsie took them away from him. I made him give them back.

967
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:48,250
哎呀，你是个值得交往的人物 性格迷人，把帽子给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}By gad, sir, you're a chap worth knowing. An amazing character. Give me your hat.

968
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,020
坐下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sit down.

969
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,520
- 我必须向你道歉，先生- 别介意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I owe you an apology, sir. SPADE: Now, never mind that.

970
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:04,890
让我们谈谈黑鸟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's talk about the black bird.

971
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,690
好吧，我们来谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, sir, let's.

972
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,030
我们来谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's.

973
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,310
这将是你所听过最令人吃惊的一件事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is going to be the most astounding thing you've ever heard of, sir.

974
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:18,610
即使我知道你是这样见多识广的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I say this knowing that a man of your caliber and profession...

975
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,700
你一定知道许多令人惊讶的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...must have known some astounding things in his time.

976
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,750
你有没有听说过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you know about the Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem...

977
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,980
耶路撒冷圣约翰骑士团？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...later known as the Knights of Rhodes?

978
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:31,440
- 他们是十字军什么的，是不是？- 很好，坐下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Crusaders or something, weren't they? -Very good. Sit down.

979
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:36,380
1539年，这些十字军骑士
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In 1539, these crusading knights...

980
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,800
说服查理五世赐给他们马耳他岛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...persuaded Emperor Charles V to give them the island of Malta.

981
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,750
他只提出一个条件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He made but one condition,

982
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:44,320
他们每年进贡一只老鹰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that they pay him each year the tribute of a falcon...

983
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:47,060
借此承认马耳他岛仍然属西班牙治下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...in acknowledgement that Malta was still under Spain.

984
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,730
你明白我说的吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Do you follow me? -Uh-huh.

985
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,730
你能想像当时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Have you any conception of the extreme,

986
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,170
骑士团有多富裕吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the immeasurable wealth of the Order?

987
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:56,870
我想他们混得相当不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I imagine they were pretty well fixed. -"Pretty well" is putting it mildly.

988
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:00,860
他们富可敌国，先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They were rolling in wealth, sir.

989
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:04,130
他们数年来掠夺东方 没有人知道多有少珠宝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For years they'd taken from the East nobody knows what spoils of gems...

990
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:06,500
贵重金属，丝绸与象牙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...precious metals, silks, ivory, sir.

991
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,650
圣战对他们来说就是烧杀抢掠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We all know the holy wars to them were largely a matter of loot.

992
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:14,360
武士们都很感激查理五世
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The knights were profoundly grateful to the Emperor Charles...

993
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:16,560
对他们的慷慨
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...for his generosity toward them.

994
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:18,510
他们偶尔想到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They hit upon the thought of sending him for his first year's tribute...

995
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:22,970
第一年的进贡，不是一只微不足道的活鸟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...not an insignificant live bird...

996
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,850
而是一只黄金老鹰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but a glorious golden falcon

997
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,020
从头到脚镶满了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}crusted from head to foot...

998
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,630
最好的珠宝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...with the finest jewels in their coffers.

999
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,720
先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Well, sir,

1000
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,030
- 你觉得怎样？- 我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}what do you think of that? -I don't know.

1001
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,040
这都是事实，历史事实
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}These are facts, historical facts.

1002
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:40,340
不是教科书的历史，但是历史没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not schoolbook history, not Mr. Wells' history, but history, nevertheless.

1003
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,220
他们把这只一英尺高的珠宝 老鹰进贡给西班牙国王查理
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They sent this jeweled bird to Charles, who was then in Spain.

1004
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:46,550
骑士团一名成员驾船运送这只金鹰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They sent it in a galley commanded by a member of the Order.

1005
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,500
但从未抵达西班牙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It never reached Spain.

1006
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:52,110
一个著名的海盗骑劫了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A famous admiral of buccaneers

1007
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:55,020
骑士的船和金鹰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}took the knights' galley and the bird.

1008
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,360
1713年金鹰出现在意大利西西里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In 1713, it turned up in Sicily.

1009
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:01,750
1840年又出现在巴黎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In 1840, it appeared in Paris.

1010
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:05,090
被人涂上一层黑瓷釉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It had, by that time, acquired a coat of black enamel...

1011
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:09,270
看起来像个很古怪的黑色雕像
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...so that it looked nothing more than a fairly interesting black statuette.

1012
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,170
在这种伪装下，它在巴黎到处流落
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In that disguise, sir, it was, as you may say, kicked around Paris...

1013
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:16,730
超过了60年，拥有者都非常愚蠢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...for over three score years by private owners too stupid...

1014
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:18,730
看不出表面下的宝藏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...to see what it was under the skin.

1015
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:19,980
直到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then, heh-heh,

1016
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,280
1923年
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}in 1923,

1017
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:27,870
一位希腊商人，名叫卡罗斯康 斯坦丁在一家小店里发现它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}a Greek dealer named Charilaos Konstantinides ...found it in an obscure shop.

1018
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:33,280
不论是多么厚的瓷釉掩盖 都逃不过他的精明眼光
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No thickness of enamel could conceal value from his eyes.

1019
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:39,760
- 你开始有点相信我了吗？ - 我没有说我不相信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You begin to believe me a little? -I haven't said I didn't.

1020
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,650
为了在研究它的历史时，又能保证安全
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir, to hold it safe while pursuing his researches into its history...

1021
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:47,200
他给它重新上了一层漆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...Charilaos re-enameled the bird.

1022
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:51,470
尽管有这层保护措施，我还是收到了风
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Despite this precaution, however, I got wind of his find.

1023
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,100
如果早几天知道就好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If I'd only known a few days sooner.

1024
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,740
我听说此事时在伦敦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was in London

1025
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,050
我立刻收拾行李，踏上港口联运列车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}when I heard. I packed a bag, got on the boat train immediately.

1026
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,920
在火车上，我打开泰晤士报
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}On the train I opened the paper,

1027
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,510
看到卡罗斯的家遭劫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and read that Charilaos' establishment...

1028
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,040
他被谋杀了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...had been burglarized and him murdered.

1029
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:10,110
果不其然，等我到达那里后发现鸟儿已经不见了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sure enough, on arriving there, I discovered the bird was gone.

1030
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,380
那是17年前的事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That was 17 years ago.

1031
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,420
我花了17年才找到那只鸟的踪迹，但我找到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir, it took me 17 years to locate that bird, but I did.

1032
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,100
我要得到它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wanted it.

1033
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,180
我不会轻言放弃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm a man not easily discouraged when I want something.

1034
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:25,360
一直追查到一位俄国将军身上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I traced it to the home of a Russian general, one Kemidov...

1035
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,930
他叫卡马多夫，住在伊斯坦布尔，他一无所知
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...in an Istanbul suburb. He didn't know a thing about it.

1036
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:31,880
对他而言，那只是个油漆雕像
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It was nothing but a black-enameled figure to him...

1037
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:34,600
但他天生爱唱反调，所以不愿意卖给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but his contrariness kept him from selling it...

1038
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,570
我派出一些“干员”去取得它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...when I made him an offer. So I sent him some agents to get it.

1039
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,140
先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir,

1040
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,740
他们弄到了，但还没到我手上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}they got it and I haven't got it.

1041
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:45,520
我一定会得到它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I'm going to get it.

1042
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,180
你的酒杯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your glass.

1043
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:52,390
那么鸟儿并不属于你们而是属于卡马多夫将军
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then the bird doesn't really belong to any of you, but to a General Kemidov?

1044
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:56,050
你为何不干脆说它属于西班牙国王
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir, you might as well say it belonged to the King of Spain.

1045
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:00,150
你又能说谁真正拥有它呢？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't see how you can honestly grant anyone else a clear title to it...

1046
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:02,320
只能是谁有就是谁的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...except by right of possession.

1047
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:04,270
现在
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And now, sir...

1048
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,970
在我们谈价码前，你需要多少时间…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...before we start to talk prices,

1049
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:10,600
才能拿到或者说愿意给出那只鸟？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}how soon can you, or how soon are you willing...

1050
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:13,390
- 几天吧 - 这我可以接受
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-...to produce the falcon? -Couple of days. That is satisfactory.

1051
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,040
祝我们的公平交易顺利，大家有钱赚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir, here's to a fair bargain. Profits large enough for both of us.

1052
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,370
你所谓公平交易是什么？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's your idea of a fair bargain?

1053
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,040
等你给我金鹰后 我会给你美金2万5千元
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I will give you $25,000 when you deliver the falcon to me...

1054
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,270
稍后再给你2万5千元
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and another 25,000 later on.

1055
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,780
或者我会给你那只金鹰价值的四分之一
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Or I will give you one quarter of what I realize on the falcon.

1056
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:31,690
那将是一笔庞大的数目
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That would amount to a greater sum.

1057
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,790
- 多么庞大？ - 谁知道呢？10万美元？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-How much greater? -Who knows? Shall we say 100,000?

1058
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:37,660
如果我说出个可能的最低价 你会相信我吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Would you believe me if I name a sum that seems probable?

1059
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:38,960
有何不可？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why not?

1060
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:41,630
25万美元怎么样？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What would you say to a quarter of a million?

1061
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,070
你认为那玩意儿值1百万？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then you think the dingus is worth a million, huh?

1062
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,970
以你的话说，有何不可？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In your own words, why not?

1063
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:54,810
- 那是一大笔钱 - 一大笔钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-That's a lot of dough. -A lot of dough.

1064
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,840
最低价？那么最高价呢？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Minimum, huh? What's the maximum?

1065
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,250
我拒绝猜测最高价
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-The maximum, I refuse to guess.

1066
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:03,870
你会认为我疯了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'd think me crazy.

1067
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,350
我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know.

1068
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,690
谁也不知道它会去到多高价，先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's no telling how high it could go, sir.

1069
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:11,590
这是我唯一确知的事实
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That is the one and only truth about it.

1070
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,900
威曼！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wilmer.

1071
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:59,700
喂，爱菲，是我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello, Effie. It's me.

1072
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:02,170
让我跟奥夏克尼希小姐说话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let me talk to Miss O'Shaughnessy.

1073
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,500
不在？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Isn’t there?

1074
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,180
什么？她没出现？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What? She didn't show up?

1075
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:15,250
回到办公室等我回来或打电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh. You get on back to the office and wait there till I come or you hear from me.

1076
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:18,160
这次我们要做对事情来倒倒运了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, let's do something right for a change.

1077
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:59,180
船运消息：今天到埠 下午5：35香港出发的鸽子号

1078
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:13,300
舱尾开始起火，在底舱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It started in the hold aft, in the rear basement.

1079
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,070
她保了什么险？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What insurance was she carrying?

1080
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,290
- 有人烧伤吗？ - 没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Anybody burnt? -No.

1081
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:18,470
只有碇泊值班在船上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Only the harbor watch was aboard.

1082
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,640
- 我认识的一个人来… - 什么？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Someone I know came-- -Huh?

1083
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:23,840
我认识的一个人下午上了船
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Someone I know came aboard this afternoon...

1084
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,140
我一直没见她，我很担心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and I haven't seen her since. I'm worried.

1085
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:29,050
不需要担心，先生，大家都脱险了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No reason to be, mister. Everybody got off all right.

1086
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:32,940
不知道你有没有看到她？ 个子小小的，大约1米6高…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wonder if you saw her. She's kind of small, about 5-foot--

1087
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:37,680
不好说，但如果她上了船，她也下了船
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I couldn't tell you, mister. But if she come aboard, she got off all right.

1088
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,020
火灾开始时，船上只有碇泊值班
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Only the harbor watch was aboard when the fire started.

1089
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:45,720
现在你知道得跟我一样多，亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now you know as much about it as I do, precious.

1090
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,360
也许他们上船了，也许没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe they went down to the ship. Maybe they didn't.

1091
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,700
关于鸟的故事很惊人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The part about the bird is thrilling.

1092
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,140
或者很荒唐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Or ridiculous.

1093
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:05,910
你知道…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know.

1094
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:09,880
老鹰…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Falcon.

1095
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:17,750
锁上门！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Lock that door.

1096
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,330
他…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is...?

1097
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:40,340
- 他是不是… - 没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is he...? Yeah.

1098
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:44,470
身上有这么多洞，他也走不远
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He couldn't have come far with those holes in him.

1099
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,820
他为什么不能活久一点，告诉我们一些事情？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why couldn't he have stayed alive long enough to tell us something?

1100
01:07:56,690 --> 01:08:00,030
看这里，别看那里了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Here, here, here, none of that now. Come on.

1101
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,890
- 你可不要给我昏倒 - 好的，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You can't pass out on me now. -All right, Sam.

1102
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:14,540
你想是不是…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you really think it's...?

1103
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:31,550
- 我们拿到了，天使我们拿到了！- 你弄疼我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-We've got it, angel, we've got it. -You're hurting me.

1104
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:34,880
接电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Answer the phone.

1105
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,960
喂？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello.

1106
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:40,120
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}[WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PHONE]

1107
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:41,790
谁？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes. Who?

1108
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,100
噢，是的！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yes.

1109
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:47,070
哪里？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Where?

1110
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,140
好的，好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, yes.

1111
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:52,960
喂？喂？喂？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello? Hello. Hello.

1112
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,700
奥夏克尼希小姐需要你，她正身处危险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That was Miss O'Shaughnessy. She's in danger.

1113
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,640
- 她在什么地方？- 柏林根安萧路26号
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Where is she? -Burlingame, 26 Ancho.

1114
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,200
山姆，她的嗓音很糟糕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sam, her voice, it was awful.

1115
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:02,270
她还没说完话就出事了 去救她，山姆！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Something happened to her before she could finish. Go help her.

1116
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:05,770
你得去救她，他要救她，结果被杀了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've got to go to her. He was helping her, and they killed him.

1117
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:07,310
你一定要去，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've got to go, Sam.

1118
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:08,940
好，我去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, I'll go.

1119
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,380
等我走了，打电话报警
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}After I've gone, you phone the police.

1120
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,850
告诉他们事情经过 但不要扯出任何名字，你不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell them how it happened, but don't drag names in.

1121
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:16,850
我接到电话就告诉你要出去了 但没说去哪里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I got the phone call and told you I had to go, but didn't say where.

1122
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:19,780
这个先别管了，告诉他们事情经过 但不要提到这个包裹
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Forget this. Tell them how it happened, without the bundle.

1123
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:22,950
现在理顺下，发生的事情照实说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Get that straight. Everything happened exactly as it did...

1124
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:26,020
但别提包裹，是我接到电话，不是你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but without the bundle, and I got the phone call, not you.

1125
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,090
- 好，山姆 - 好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Yes, Sam. -Okay.

1126
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:35,040
锁好门，警察来后再开门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shut this door and lock it behind me. Don't open it till the police come.

1127
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:36,370
他是谁？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you know who he is?

1128
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:39,680
耶哥船长，鸽子号的主人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Yeah, he's Captain Jacoby, master of the La Paloma.

1129
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:42,440
你是个好女孩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're a good man, sister.

1130
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:05,100
- 借支笔好吗？- 好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Can I borrow your pencil? -Sure.

1131
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,820
- 喂，法兰克 - 嗨，史派特先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Say, Frank. -Oh, hello, Mr. Spade.

1132
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:34,580
- 气还足够用吗？- 当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You got plenty of gas? -Sure thing.

1133
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,780
知不知道柏林根安萧路？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you know where Ancho Street is in Burlingame?

1134
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:38,260
不知道，但可以找得到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Nope, but we can find her.

1135
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:39,990
去26号，越快越好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Twenty-six is the number...

1136
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,260
好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-...and the sooner the better. -All right.

1137
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:52,370
不要熄火
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Keep your motor running.

1138
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,690
- 假情报，史派特先生？- 是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Bum steer, Mr. Spade? -Yeah.

1139
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:28,940
去找个电话亭
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's get to a phone booth.

1140
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:31,700
喂，柏琳太太？爱菲在吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello, Mrs. Perine? Is Effie there?

1141
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:33,110
请叫她来听电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, please.

1142
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,800
嗨，亲爱的，有什么好消息？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello, precious. What's the good news?

1143
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:40,570
没有，那是假情报，你确定那是她的声音？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, no. It was a bum steer. Are you sure that was her voice?

1144
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,580
是骗人的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, it was hooey.

1145
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,420
一切都没有问题？没有提到包裹吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Everything go all right? Nothing said about the bundle, huh?

1146
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:47,920
好极了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's swell.

1147
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:50,150
他们有没有带你到局子里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They take you down to the hall?

1148
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:52,490
好，亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right.

1149
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:56,340
好好睡一觉，你听上去疲惫极了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You better hit the hay and get a good night's rest. You sound all in.

1150
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:59,270
不，等明天再说，我要回家了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, no. Save it till tomorrow. I'm going on home.

1151
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:08,190
- 谢谢，晚安，法兰克 - 晚安，史派特先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Thanks. Good night, Frank. -Good night, Mr. Spade.

1152
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,510
我一直躲在街上门边
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}O'SHAUGHNESSY: I've been hiding in a doorway up the street.

1153
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:19,380
还以为你不回来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I thought you'd never come.

1154
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:31,180
你走得动吗？还是要我背你？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can you make it, or shall I carry you?

1155
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:35,120
等我躺下来就没事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll be all right as soon as I can get some place where I can lie down.

1156
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:49,700
先生，我们都到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir, we're all here.

1157
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:52,570
让我们坐下舒舒服服地谈谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, let's come in and sit down and be comfortable and talk.

1158
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,830
当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}SPADE:Sure.

1159
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:58,070
- 走开，休想搜我身 - 站好，闭嘴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Get away. You're not gonna frisk me. -Stand still. Shut up.

1160
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:00,740
把你的爪子拿开，要不你就开枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Take your paws off me, or I'll make you use that gun.

1161
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:03,740
问问你老板想不想我说话前就中枪？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Ask your boss if he wants me shot up before we talk.

1162
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,520
算了，威曼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Never mind, Wilmer.

1163
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,050
你简直顽固到家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You certainly are a most headstrong individual.

1164
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,260
让我们坐下来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, let's be seated.

1165
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:18,690
你准备付头期拿走老鹰吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you ready to make the first payment and take the falcon off my hands?

1166
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,960
先生，关于这交易…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir, as to that....

1167
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,420
关于…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}As to that....

1168
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:31,140
1万元？我们谈的时候比这更多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Ten thousand? We were talking about a lot more money than this.

1169
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:34,270
此一时彼一时，但这可是真金白银啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, sir, we were. But this is genuine coin of the realm.

1170
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:36,740
一块钱能买十块钱的情报
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}With a dollar of this, you can buy $10 of talk.

1171
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:39,210
现在我们可有更多人要照料了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And there are more of us to be taken care of now.

1172
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,440
也许，但老鹰在我手上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That may be, but I've got the falcon.

1173
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,110
史派特先生，我不必提醒你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I shouldn't think it necessary to remind you, Mr. Spade...

1174
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:47,110
你有老鹰，但我们有你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...that you may have the falcon, but we certainly have you.

1175
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:50,680
我正想忘记这烦心事呢 我们等下再谈钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm trying not to let that worry me. We'll get back to the money later on.

1176
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,460
先要讨论一件事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's something else to be discussed first.

1177
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,370
我们必须要有替罪羊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We've got to have a fall guy.

1178
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,730
警方需要有人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The police have gotta have a victim,

1179
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:01,100
为三件谋杀案顶罪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}somebody they can pin those murders on.

1180
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:04,770
三件？只有两件啊 你的同事是被德斯派杀的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Three? But there's only two, because Thursby certainly killed your partner.

1181
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,570
好吧，就两件，那有什么区别？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Only two, what difference does it make?

1182
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,230
关键是，我们必须给警方…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-We've got to give the police-- -Come, come, Mr. Spade.

1183
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:12,440
得了，史派德先生 别指望我们相信这个时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can't expect us to believe at this late date...

1184
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,930
你会害怕警察
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...that you're the least bit afraid of the police.

1185
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:18,110
- 或你没有办法处理…- 我已经陷得太深了，顾德曼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Or that you're not able to handle-- -I'm in this up to my neck.

1186
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:21,670
到时候一定要找一个替罪羊 如果没有，我就会成为替罪羊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've got to find somebody, a victim, when the time comes. If I don't, I'll be it.

1187
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:29,050
让我们把这位杀手给警方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's give them the gunsel.

1188
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,190
他杀了德斯派与耶哥，对不对？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He actually did shoot Thursby and Jacoby, didn't he?

1189
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:35,030
他简直像是订做的，看看他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anyway, he's made to order for the part. Look at him.

1190
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,720
交出他吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's give him to them.

1191
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:41,630
天，你真有性格
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}By gad, sir, you are a character.That you are.

1192
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,530
没有人能猜得出你下一步会怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's never any tellingwhat you'll say or do next...

1193
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:46,600
但一定会叫人吃惊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...except that it's boundto be astonishing.

1194
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:48,630
这是最好的办法，把他交给他们…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-It's our best bet. With him in their hands--

1195
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:51,870
我根本不会想这种事，哪怕一瞬间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-My dear man, can't you see...

1196
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:54,540
简直荒谬透顶
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...that if I, even for a moment thoughtof doing such a thing.... That's ridiculous.

1197
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:58,240
威曼就像是我的儿子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I feel towards Wilmer here just exactlyas if he were my own son.

1198
01:14:58,310 --> 01:14:59,440
真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Really, I do.

1199
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,440
就算我考虑到了你的建议
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But if I even for a momentthought of doing what you propose...

1200
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,860
要怎么样才能使威曼不告诉警方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...what in the world would keep Wilmer from telling the police...

1201
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:08,380
所有关于老鹰的事情？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...every last detailabout the falcon and all--

1202
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,850
随便他讲破天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let him talk his head off.

1203
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:13,060
我保证没有人会理会他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll guarantee you nobody'll do anything about it.

1204
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:16,200
你觉得如何，威曼？真好笑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, well, what do you think of this,Wilmer? Mighty funny.

1205
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:17,720
真好笑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mighty funny.

1206
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:23,830
感觉好些吗，亲爱的？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How do you feel now?Any better, precious?

1207
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,270
好多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}[WHISPERING]Much better.

1208
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:27,300
但我害怕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I'm frightened.

1209
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:30,230
不要害怕，不会发生什么坏事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, don't be.Nothing very bad's going to happen here.

1210
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:32,500
想喝点什么吗，亲爱的？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You want a drink, angel?

1211
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:34,440
小心点，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Be careful, Sam.

1212
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:38,370
怎么样？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well?

1213
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,120
看你这么认真
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you're really serious,

1214
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:42,920
我们礼貌上应该听你说说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the least we can doin common politeness is hear you out.

1215
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:45,510
但你要怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, how would you be able to fix it

1216
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,120
才不会让威曼牵累我们？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so that Wilmer couldn't do us any harm?

1217
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,780
我可以告诉区检察官布莱恩 如果他想要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can show our district attorney, that if he goes around...

1218
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:53,420
大肆拉人，他就会有件棘手案子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...trying to collect everybody,he's gonna have a tangled case...

1219
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:56,350
但如果就他钉死这个威曼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but if he sticks to Wilmer here...

1220
01:15:56,570 --> 01:15:59,520
他就可以不费吹灰之力定罪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...he can get a conviction standing on his head.

1221
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:04,440
站起来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Get up on your feet.

1222
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:07,460
我受够你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've taken all the riding from you I'm gonna take.

1223
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,310
起来，拼个你死我活
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Get up and shoot it out.

1224
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:11,040
西部枪神
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Young Wild West.

1225
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:12,910
也许你最好告诉他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell him that shooting me before you get your hands on the falcon...

1226
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:16,150
没拿到老鹰前就杀了我 是很糟糕的做法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...is gonna be bad for business.

1227
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:18,440
好了，好了，威曼，不能再闹了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, now, Wilmer. We can't have any of that.

1228
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,970
你不该让自己扯上这么重要的事情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You shouldn't let yourself attach importance to these things.

1229
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:22,580
叫他别扯我进来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Then tell him to lay off me.

1230
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:23,950
好了，威曼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, Wilmer.

1231
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:30,890
你的计划完全行不通，我们不要再说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your plan is not at all satisfactory, sir. Let's not say anything more about it.

1232
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:33,030
好吧，那我有另一个建议
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right. I've got another suggestion.

1233
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:36,150
也许没有第一个好，至少聊胜于无
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It may not be as good as the first, but it's better than nothing.

1234
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,800
- 你要不要听？- 当然要听
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You want to hear it? -Most assuredly.

1235
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:44,390
把开罗交给警方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Give them Cairo.

1236
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,240
天哪，先生…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, by gad, sir.

1237
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,930
假如我们把你或奥夏克尼希小姐交给警方如何？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Suppose we give them you or Miss O'Shaughnessy? How about that?

1238
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:50,810
你要老鹰，我有老鹰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You want the falcon. I've got it.

1239
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,550
替罪羊是我要求的代价 至于奥夏克尼希小姐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The fall guy's part of the price I'm asking.

1240
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:59,150
如果你们认为她可以充当替罪羊 我愿意加以考虑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}As for Miss O'Shaughnessy, if you think she can be rigged for the part......I'm willingto discuss it with you.

1241
01:16:58,590 --> 01:17:02,380
你似乎忘记了你根本没有资格讨价还价
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You seem to forget that you are not in a position at all to insist upon anything.

1242
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:03,680
现在，先生们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, come, gentlemen.

1243
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,390
让我们基于友善的态度讨论
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's keep our discussion on a friendly basis.

1244
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,220
开罗先生说得有一定道理
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There certainly is something in what Mr. Cairo said.

1245
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:14,320
如果你们杀了我，你们怎么拿到鸟？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you kill me, how are you gonna get the bird?

1246
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,090
如果我知道你们不敢杀我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If I know you can't kill me,

1247
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:18,230
你们要怎么吓唬我给你们？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}how are you going to scare me into giving it to you?

1248
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:22,470
除了杀人与威胁之外 还有其他说服人的方法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sir, there are other means of persuasion besides killing and threatening to kill.

1249
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:23,980
是的…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}SPADE: Yes, that's....

1250
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,610
此话说得没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's true.

1251
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:32,200
但是，如果没有死亡威胁一切都不管用
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But they're none of them any good unless the threat of death is behind them.

1252
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,640
你明白我意思吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You see what I mean?

1253
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:37,080
如果你轻举妄动，就必须杀了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you start something, I'll make it a matter of your having to kill me,

1254
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:38,610
或算了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}or call it off.

1255
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:43,850
这种态度需要双方非常谨慎的判断
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's an attitude, sir, that calls for the most delicate judgment on both sides.

1256
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:46,180
因为在白热化中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Because, as you know, in the heat of action...

1257
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:49,220
人们往往会忘记最好的做法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...men are likely to forget where their best interests lie...

1258
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,630
而被情绪所左右
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and let their emotions carry them away.

1259
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,970
那我这方要做的就是跟你牢牢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then the trick from my angle is to make my play strong enough...

1260
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,960
拴在一条线上 别激怒你，让你失去理智
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...to tie you up, but not make you mad enough to bump me off...

1261
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,300
宰了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-...against your better judgment.

1262
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:02,290
天，先生，你真是个人物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-By gad, sir, you are a character.

1263
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:10,450
大只佬，他们要出卖你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Six-two uneven. They're selling you out, sonny.

1264
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:13,510
我希望你不会顾忌…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I hope you're not letting yourself be influenced by the guns...

1265
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:16,410
这些袖珍版亡命徒挥舞的手枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...these pocket-edition desperadoes are waving around.

1266
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,690
我练过从他们身上取走武器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Because I've practiced taking guns away from these boys before...

1267
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,090
一点也不会困难
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...so we'll have no trouble there.

1268
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:23,790
- 我们的威曼将是…- 好了！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Wilmer here is-- -All right.

1269
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:26,310
威曼！威曼！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wilmer. Wilmer!

1270
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:28,220
威曼！威曼！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wilmer!

1271
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:31,410
威曼！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wilmer.

1272
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:58,930
我们有了替罪羊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's our fall guy.

1273
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:02,200
现在就答应我，否则我就要把老鹰与你们都交给警方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Either you'll say yes, or I'll turn the falcon and the whole lot of you in.

1274
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,530
这样不好，先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't like that, sir.

1275
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:05,730
你不喜欢，是吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You won't like it. Well?

1276
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:12,140
你可以把他交给警方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can have him.

1277
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,410
要等到天亮以后我才能拿到老鹰，或者稍后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I won't be able to get the falcon till daylight, or maybe later.

1278
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:19,790
我想到为了大家好 最好彼此都不离开对方视线
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It strikes me it'd be best if we did not get out of each other's sight...

1279
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:23,250
等到交易完成，你有那个信封吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...until our business has been transacted. You have the envelope?

1280
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:25,700
在奥夏克尼希小姐手上 没事，抓紧喽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miss O'Shaughnessy has it. Hang on to it.

1281
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,960
我们不用看不到对方 那玩意儿会送被到这里的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We don't have to lose sight of each other. The dingus'll be brought here.

1282
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,670
好极了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Excellent, sir, excellent.

1283
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:33,070
作为1万元与威曼的交换
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And in exchange for the 10,000 and Wilmer...

1284
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:35,770
你给我们老鹰和1、2个小时的宽限
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...you'll give us the falcon and an hour or two of grace.

1285
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:38,210
我们先谈清楚细节
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's get the details fixed, first.

1286
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:42,630
他为什么要杀德斯派以及在哪里杀死的耶哥船长？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why did he shoot Thursby and why, where and how did he shoot Captain Jacoby?

1287
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,770
我必须知道详情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've got to know all that happened, so I can be sure...

1288
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,750
才能掩饰好不符合的细节
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-...the parts that don't fit are covered up.

1289
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:48,850
我会坦诚相告，先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I shall be candid with you, sir.

1290
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:51,380
德斯派是奥夏克尼希小姐的帮手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thursby was Miss O'Shaughnessy's ally.

1291
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:53,560
我们认为那样做掉他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We believed that disposing of him...

1292
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:57,560
就会使她摒弃异见与我们合作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...would cause Miss O'Shaughnessy to stop and think that it would be best...

1293
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:00,930
解决老鹰的问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...to patch up her differences with us regarding the falcon.

1294
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:04,130
你们没有试图跟他谈生意就先宰了他？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You didn't try to make a deal with him before giving him the works?

1295
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:06,400
我们当然试图说服他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We did. Yes, sir. We most certainly did.

1296
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:09,980
当晚我亲自与他谈话，但他油盐不进
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I talked to him myself that very night, but I could do nothing with him.

1297
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:13,040
他对奥夏克尼希小姐忠心耿耿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He was quite determinedly loyal to Miss O'Shaughnessy.

1298
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:17,580
于是威曼就跟踪他，解决了他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So Wilmer followed him back to the hotel and did what he did.

1299
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,890
这听起来不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That sounds all right.

1300
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,120
现在轮到耶哥
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now Jacoby.

1301
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:27,360
耶哥船长会死 全是奥夏克尼希小姐的过错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Captain Jacoby's death was entirely Miss O'Shaughnessy's fault.

1302
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,140
告诉我事情经过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}SPADE: Tell me what happened.

1303
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:32,700
如你所猜测的，开罗先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Cairo, as you must have surmised, got in touch with me...

1304
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,580
昨天离开警局后就来找我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...after he left police headquarters yesterday night.

1305
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:38,910
他明白共同合作的好处
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He recognized the mutual advantage of pooling forces.

1306
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:41,550
开罗先生的判断力很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mr. Cairo is a man of nice judgment.

1307
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:45,150
鸽子号是他想出来的 他读到船进港的消息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The Paloma was his thought. He saw the notice of its arrival in the papers...

1308
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,530
想起他在香港听说的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and remembered he had heard in Hong Kong...

1309
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:50,830
耶哥与奥夏克尼希小姐碰过头
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...that Jacoby and Miss O'Shaughnessy were seen together.

1310
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:55,830
他看到那消息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir, he saw that notice and,

1311
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:58,470
便想出了整个内幕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}putting two and two together, guessed the truth.

1312
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:01,210
她把鸟交给耶哥，叫他带来这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She had given the bird to Jacoby to bring here for her.

1313
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:03,740
在那个关头，你决定迷昏我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And at that juncture, you decided to slip me a Mickey?

1314
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:06,240
我们完全不需要你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There was no place for you in our plan, sir.

1315
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,950
我们决定不使自己陷入窘境
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So we decided to spare ourselves any possible embarrassment.

1316
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:14,060
开罗、威曼与我联络了耶哥船长
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mr. Cairo and Wilmer and I went to call on Captain Jacoby.

1317
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:18,080
我们抵达时正好碰上奥夏克尼希小姐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We were lucky enough to arrive while Miss O'Shaughnessy was there.

1318
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:21,630
会谈十分不顺利，但我们终于说服了她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In many ways, the conference was difficult, but we finally persuaded...

1319
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,800
接受我们的条件，至少我们这么认为
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...Miss O'Shaughnessy to come to terms, or so we thought.

1320
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,330
我们下了船，准备回旅馆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We then left the boat and set out for my hotel...

1321
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:30,830
我准备要付钱给奥夏克尼希小姐买下那只老鹰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...where I was to pay Miss O'Shaughnessy and receive the bird.

1322
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:33,600
我们应该更聪明些
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir, we mere men should have known better.

1323
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,240
在路上，她与耶哥船长还有老鹰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}En route, she, Captain Jacoby and the falcon...

1324
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,950
从我们指缝中逃脱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...slipped completely through our fingers.

1325
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,610
干得很俐落，真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It was neatly done, sir. Indeed, it was.

1326
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,660
你们在离开之前就烧了船？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You touched off the boat before you left?

1327
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:46,190
不是故意的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, not intentionally.

1328
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:50,000
但我们必须承认，我们至少是威曼要为火灾负责
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Though, I daresay, we, or Wilmer at least, were responsible for the fire.

1329
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:54,600
我们在船上会谈时，威曼出去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}While the rest of us were talking in the cabin, Wilmer went about the boat...

1330
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,000
寻找老鹰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...trying to find the falcon.

1331
01:21:57,950 --> 01:22:00,170
显然他对火柴很不小心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No doubt, he was careless with matches.

1332
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,810
那枪击呢？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How about the shooting?

1333
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:05,410
我们在奥夏克尼希小姐公寓里追上她与耶哥
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We caught up with Miss O'Shaughnessy and Jacoby at her apartment.

1334
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:09,480
我叫威曼守着防火梯 }然后才去按门铃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I sent Wilmer downstairs to cover the fire escape before ringing the bell.

1335
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:13,500
当她透过门问我们是什么人时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And, sure enough, while she was asking us who we were through the door...

1336
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:16,270
我们在告诉她时 听到一扇窗户被打开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and we were telling her, we heard a window go up.

1337
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:19,360
威曼在耶哥爬下防火梯时射杀了他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wilmer shot Jacoby as he was coming down the fire escape...

1338
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:23,440
开了几枪，但耶哥非常健壮 没有丢掉老鹰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...shot him more than once, but Jacoby was too tough to fall or drop the falcon.

1339
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:27,330
他爬下去，撞倒威曼逃走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He climbed down the rest of the way, knocked Wilmer over and ran off.

1340
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:32,520
我们“说服”了奥夏克尼希小姐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We persuaded-- That is the word, sir. We persuaded Miss O'Shaughnessy...

1341
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:35,650
告诉我们耶哥会带老鹰去何处
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...to tell us where she had told Captain Jacoby to take the falcon.

1342
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:38,180
然后又“说服”她打电话引你出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And we further persuaded her to phone your office...

1343
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:41,390
趁耶哥还没有找到你引开你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...in an attempt to draw you away before Jacoby got there...

1344
01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:43,060
但我们不走运
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but, unfortunately for us...

1345
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:46,400
“说服”她用了太长时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...it had taken us too long to persuade Miss O'Shaughnessy.

1346
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:48,830
你抢先拿到了老鹰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And you had the falcon before we could reach you.

1347
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:07,060
威曼，很抱歉要失去你，但我要你知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wilmer, I'm sorry indeed to lose you, but I want you to know...

1348
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:09,860
我把你视为己出
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...I couldn't be fonder of you if you were my own son.

1349
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:12,960
如果失去一个儿子，总还可以再生一个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But, well, if you lose a son, it's possible to get another.

1350
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,690
但世上只有一只马耳他之鹰
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's only one Maltese Falcon.

1351
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:20,270
人还年青时，不会了解这种事情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When you're young, you simply don't understand these things.

1352
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,910
要不要来点咖啡？煮点水，天使
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How about some coffee? Put the pot on, will you, angel?

1353
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:27,080
我不想撇下我们的客人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't like to leave our guests.

1354
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,320
当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}O'SHAUGHNESSY: Surely. -Just a moment, my dear.

1355
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:32,330
等等，把信封留下不是更好吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hadn't you better leave the envelope in here?

1356
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,770
你担心没有了，干脆坐上面得了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sit on it, if you're afraid of losing it.

1357
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,790
你误会了，根本不是那么回事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You misunderstand me. It's not that at all.

1358
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:41,330
但做生意就必须遵守生意的规矩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But business should be transacted in a businesslike manner.

1359
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:46,170
譬如说，现在这里只有九张钞票
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For instance, there are only nine bills here now.

1360
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:49,770
当我交给你时本来是十张，你很清楚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There were 10 when I handed them to you, as you very well know.

1361
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:57,640
怎样？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well?

1362
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,600
怎么回事？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I want to know about this.

1363
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:08,700
你摸走了一张
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You palmed it.

1364
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:09,890
- 我摸走了一张？- 是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I palmed it? -Yes.

1365
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:12,030
你是想认了，还是要搜身？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you want to stand for a frisk?

1366
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:15,260
你承认了吧，要不我要搜身了 没有第三条路
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're going to admit it, or I'm gonna search you. There's no third way.

1367
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:17,120
我相信你会，我真的相信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I believe you would. I do.

1368
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:19,200
你是个人物，如果你不介意我这么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are a character, if you don't mind my saying so.

1369
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:20,750
你偷摸了一张
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You palmed it.

1370
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,190
是的，先生，我承认
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, sir, that I did.

1371
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,230
我必须时不时开个小玩笑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I must have my little joke now and then.

1372
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:33,350
我很好奇在这种情况下你会有什么反应
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was curious to know what you would do in a situation of this sort.

1373
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:35,790
你成功地通过考验
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I must say you passed the test with flying colors.

1374
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:38,290
如果是威曼这年纪的人这么干还说得过去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's the sort of thing I'd expect from somebody Wilmer's age.

1375
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:41,140
这钱很快就是你的了，收下吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This will soon be yours. You might as well take it.

1376
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:42,900
我那份应该超过1万元
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I ought to have more than 10,000.

1377
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:45,370
这是头期，稍后还有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You understand this is the first payment. Later.

1378
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:48,110
稍后你会给我1百万
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yes. Later you'll give me millions,

1379
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:50,080
现在给我1万5，如何？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but how's about 15,000 now?

1380
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:53,740
坦白说，我用我名誉担保
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Frankly and candidly, upon my word of honor as a gentleman...

1381
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,860
目前我只能凑到1万元，不能再多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}... 10,000 is all the money I can raise.

1382
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,020
但你没有说“绝对不能”
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But you didn't say positively.

1383
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:01,730
绝对不能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Positively.

1384
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:09,300
我想给你一些忠告
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd like to give you a word of advice.

1385
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:10,400
请讲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Go ahead.

1386
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:13,540
你要给她一些钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I daresay you're going to give her money...

1387
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:16,080
但如果你给她的钱没有如她所期待的一样多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but if you don't give her as much as she thinks she ought to have...

1388
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,610
我的忠告是“要小心”
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...my word of advice is be careful.

1389
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,320
有危险？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Dangerous?

1390
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:25,050
非常危险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Very.

1391
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:29,260
- 咖啡煮得如何，天使？- 几分钟就好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-How's the coffee coming, angel? O'SHAUGHNESSY: In a few minutes.

1392
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:31,630
天快亮了，史派特先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's almost daylight, Mr. Spade.

1393
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:34,030
你能不能现在去拿？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can you start getting it now?

1394
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:35,680
我想可以
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I guess so.

1395
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:49,910
喂？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello?

1396
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:53,250
喂，亲爱的，很抱歉大清早吵醒你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello, precious. I'm sorry to get you up so early.

1397
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:56,000
现在仔细听我，是这么回事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, listen carefully. Here's the plot.

1398
01:25:56,060 --> 01:26:00,060
在我们邮局的信箱中有一个信封上面有我的笔迹
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In the holland box at the post office there's an envelope with my scrawl.

1399
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:04,870
里面有一个寄物箱的收据 可以拿到我们昨天收到的包裹
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In that envelope, there's a parcel-room check for the bundle we got yesterday.

1400
01:26:05,650 --> 01:26:08,640
立刻把那个包裹拿到饭店这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh-huh. Now, get that bundle and bring it here, pdq.

1401
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:11,880
好女孩，动身吧，再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's a good girl. Now hustle. Goodbye.

1402
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,540
谢谢你，抱歉破坏了你的休假日
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thanks, lady. Sorry to spoil your day of rest.

1403
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:05,770
你也不是第一次破坏了 还有什么事吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not the first one you've spoiled. Anything else?

1404
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:08,180
- 没有，谢谢 - 那就再见了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-No. No, thanks. -Bye-bye, then.

1405
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:29,500
交给你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}SPADE:There you are.

1406
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,680
经过了17年…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, after 17 years....

1407
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:23,830
就是它了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It is it.

1408
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,010
但我们要确定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But we'll make sure.

1409
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:45,740
是假的！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fake.

1410
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:47,830
假货！铅做的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's a phony. It's lead.

1411
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:49,600
铅做的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's lead.

1412
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:51,370
这是假的！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's a fake.

1413
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:54,800
你的玩笑开够了吗？说话啊！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've had your little joke. Now, tell us about it.

1414
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,280
不，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, Sam. No.

1415
01:28:56,730 --> 01:28:59,020
这就是我从卡马多夫那里得到的，我发誓
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's the one I got from Kemidov. I swear it.

1416
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:00,210
你…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You.

1417
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:03,590
是你搞砸的！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's you who bungled it.

1418
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:07,030
你的笨计划！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You and your stupid attempt to buy it.

1419
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,080
卡马多夫发现了它的价值
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Kemidov found out how valuable it was.

1420
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:12,830
难怪我们这么容易偷到它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No wonder we had such an easy time stealing it.

1421
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,400
你这个白痴！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You imbecile.

1422
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,710
胖笨瓜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You bloated idiot.

1423
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:18,670
你这个猪头，你…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You stupid fathead, you.

1424
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:50,240
不错，是俄国人搞的鬼，毫无疑问
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, it's the Russian's hand. There's no doubt about it.

1425
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,780
你有什么建议？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, sir, what do you suggest?

1426
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:54,440
我们可以在这里哭泣或互相叫骂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We shed tears and call each other names...

1427
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,620
我们也可以去伊斯坦布尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...or shall we go to Istanbul?

1428
01:29:58,050 --> 01:29:59,680
你要去吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you going?

1429
01:29:59,890 --> 01:30:03,850
我花了17年找这玩意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Seventeen years I've wanted that little item and have been trying to get it.

1430
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:06,520
如果必须再花一年时间追寻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If we must spend another year on the quest...

1431
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,900
也不过是百上加斤罢了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...well, sir, it will be an additional expenditure in time...

1432
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:13,670
只占个5.57%
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...of only five and fifteen-seventeenths percent.

1433
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:15,930
我要跟你去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm going with you.

1434
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:33,580
威曼？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wilmer.

1435
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,930
好大一群贼啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}[SPADE LAUGHS] A swell lot of thieves.

1436
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:41,170
你没什么好得意的 先生，还没到山穷水尽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}GUTMAN: We've little to boast about, but the world hasn't come to an end...

1437
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,230
只不过是小小挫败
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...just because we've run into a setback.

1438
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:46,690
- 我必须索回那笔钱 - 我达成了我的协议，你拿到了那玩意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I must ask you for that envelope. -I held up my end. You got your dingus.

1439
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:49,070
你自己运气不好 不是我的，这不是你想要的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's your hard luck it wasn't what you wanted.

1440
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:51,140
先生，我们都失败了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, come, sir, we've all failed...

1441
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:55,220
你不能要我们负担全部损失
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and there's no reason for expecting any of us to bear the whole brunt.

1442
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:58,260
简而言之，请把1万元还给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In short, sir, I must ask you for my 10,000.

1443
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:05,090
这算是偿付我的时间与精神
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This'll take care of my time and expenses.

1444
01:31:08,150 --> 01:31:10,100
现在让我们道别
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, sir, we'll say goodbye to you...

1445
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:13,640
除非你想跟我们去伊斯坦布尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...unless you care to undertake the Istanbul expedition with us.

1446
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,970
你不去？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't?

1447
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:17,530
我倒希望你能同行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, frankly, sir, I'd like to have you along.

1448
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:20,250
你是个足智多谋的角色
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're a man of nice judgment and many resources.

1449
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,780
既然没得选择了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now that there's no alternative...

1450
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:23,830
我想你能够应付警察的 不需要替罪羊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...I daresay you'll manage without a fall guy.

1451
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:25,090
我会没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-I'll make out all right. -Well, sir, the shortest farewells are best.

1452
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:29,270
道别不需冗长，拜拜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Adieu.

1453
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:36,090
你也是，奥夏克尼希小姐 那件珍品就留给你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And to you, Miss O'Shaughnessy, I leave the rara avis on the table there...

1454
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,800
作为纪念好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...as a little memento.

1455
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,950
喂，柏郝斯警探在吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello. Is Sergeant Polhaus there?

1456
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,500
请找他听电话我是山姆?史派特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Put him on. This is Sam Spade.

1457
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:07,110
听好，我有情报要告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello. Tom? Now, listen. I've got something for you. Here it is.

1458
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:10,270
一个叫威曼的小子杀了耶哥与德斯派
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jacoby and Thursby were killed by a kid named Wilmer Cook.

1459
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:13,910
他年约20，1米68，穿灰色大衣
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. He's about 20 years old, 5'6", wearing a gray overcoat.

1460
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,250
他替一个叫顾德曼的工作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's working for a man named Kasper Gutman.

1461
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,990
他重达136公斤，很好认
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, you can't miss Gutman. He must weigh 300 pounds.

1462
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:20,920
开罗也跟他们在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That fellow Cairo's in with him too.

1463
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:22,780
他们刚离开亚力山卓旅馆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They just left for the Alexandria Hotel.

1464
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:25,200
你得快行动，他们想要溜出城外
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'll have to move fast. They're blowing town.

1465
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:27,400
要小心那个威曼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Watch yourself when you go up against the kid.

1466
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:29,200
就这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, that's right. Very.

1467
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,860
祝你好运
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, good luck, Tom.

1468
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:33,460
他们一旦被抓，就会供出我们 我们坐在火药桶上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They'll talk, when they're nailed. We're sitting on dynamite.

1469
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:36,680
我们只有几分钟应付警察 告诉我一切，要快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We've only got minutes to get set. Give me all of it.

1470
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,310
你第一次来我办公室时 为何想要跟踪德斯派？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When you came to my office, why did you want Thursby shadowed?

1471
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:41,910
我告诉你了，我以为他要背叛我，我想查明
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I told you, Sam. I thought he was betraying me.

1472
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:43,270
别说谎！你已经钩住德斯派了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You had Thursby hooked.

1473
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:46,410
你知道的，你想在船长带着赃物来前，干掉德斯派
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You wanted to get rid of him before Jacoby came...

1474
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,260
这样你就不需要跟他瓜分 你的计划是什么？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...with the loot so you wouldn't have to split it with him. Isn't that so?

1475
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:51,010
我以为如果他知道有人跟着他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I thought if he knew someone was following him

1476
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,400
他会被吓走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}he'd be frightened into going away.

1477
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:55,170
麦尔斯没有笨到会第一晚就被发现
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miles wasn't clumsy enough to be spotted the first night.

1478
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:57,700
你告诉了德斯派他被人跟踪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You told Thursby he was being followed.

1479
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,460
我告诉了他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I told him.

1480
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:04,040
我告诉了他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I told him.

1481
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:06,230
是的，但请相信我，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, but please believe me, Sam.

1482
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,670
如果我知道佛洛德会杀麦尔斯 我就不会告诉他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wouldn't have if I thought Floyd would kill him.

1483
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:11,200
不错，他不会杀麦尔斯，亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you thought he wouldn't kill Miles, you were right.

1484
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,660
麦尔斯没有什么大脑，但他作为侦探
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miles hadn't many brains, but he'd had too many years as a detective...

1485
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:18,920
经验丰富，不会那样被他跟踪的人逮到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...to be caught by a man he was shadowing

1486
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:19,240
跑到死胡同里 枪都没拔出来，外套还扣着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}up a blind alley with his gun on his hip.

1487
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:21,740
他肯定是和你去那里的，亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But he'd have gone up there with you, angel.

1488
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:24,090
他色迷心窍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He was just dumb enough for that.

1489
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:27,360
他跟着你，流着口水
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He'd have looked you up and down, licked his lips

1490
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,260
咧着嘴笑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and gone grinning from ear to ear.

1491
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,790
你在黑暗中可以靠近他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You could have stood as close to him as you liked...

1492
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:34,420
然后开枪杀了他，用德斯派给你的枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and put a hole through him with a gun you got from Thursby.

1493
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:35,510
别，山姆，别那样说！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Don't, Sam.

1494
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:37,300
闭嘴！警察随时就到！说啊！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-The police'll be here any minute, now talk.

1495
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:38,530
你为什么指控我…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Why do you accuse me?

1496
01:33:38,610 --> 01:33:40,350
现在没时间扮纯情女学生了！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-This isn't the time for that act.

1497
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:41,990
我们两个都岌岌可危
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We're both of us sitting under the gallows.

1498
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:44,250
你为什么要杀麦尔斯？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, why did you shoot Miles?

1499
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:48,330
我本来不想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't mean to at first, really, I didn't.

1500
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:52,240
但当我后来发现德斯派没那么容易害怕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But when I found out that Floyd couldn't be frightened....

1501
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:54,370
看着你我实在说不出来，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't look at you and tell you this, Sam.

1502
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:57,450
你以为德斯派会擒住麦尔斯 他们有一人会被干掉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You thought Thursby would tackle Miles and one would go down.

1503
01:33:57,530 --> 01:33:59,090
如果德斯派死了，你就摆脱他了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If Thursby was killed, you were rid of him.

1504
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:01,390
如果是麦尔斯 你就会设局让德斯派被逮住
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If it was Miles, you'd see Thursby set up for it.

1505
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:02,880
- 对吗？- 差不多吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Something like that.

1506
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,680
结果德斯派没有攻击他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-When Thursby wasn't going to...

1507
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:07,000
所以你就借了他的枪自己下手，对不对？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...you borrowed his gun and did it yourself.

1508
01:34:07,070 --> 01:34:09,330
当你听说德斯派被杀后 你知道顾德曼来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When you heard Thursby was shot, you knew Gutman was in town.

1509
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:10,980
你需要另一个保护者
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You needed somebody

1510
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:14,430
顶替德斯派的人，所以就回来找我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to fill Thursby's boots, so you came back to me.

1511
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:17,560
是的！甜心，不仅是如此
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes. Oh, sweetheart, it wasn't only that.

1512
01:34:18,050 --> 01:34:20,290
我迟早都会来找你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd have come back to you, sooner or later.

1513
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:23,190
当我第一次见到你，我就知道…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}From the very first instant I saw you, I knew.

1514
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:29,680
如果你运气好，20年后就会出狱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, if you get a good break, you'll be out of Tehachapi in 20 years...

1515
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,950
那时候就可以来找我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and you can come back to me then.

1516
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:35,790
我希望他们不会吊死你 爱的，那么美的脖子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck.

1517
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:41,170
- 你不会…- 是的，亲爱的，我要把你交出去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-You're not.... -Yes, angel, I'm gonna send you over.

1518
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,610
也许会被判无期徒刑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The chances are you'll get off with life.

1519
01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:46,250
如果行为良好，20年就可以出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That means, if you're a good girl, you'll be out in 20 years.

1520
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,040
我会等待你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll be waiting for you.

1521
01:34:48,110 --> 01:34:50,710
如果他们吊死你，我就永远怀念你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If they hang you, I'll always remember you.

1522
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:54,740
不要这么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't, Sam.

1523
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:57,240
别这样说，哪怕是玩笑
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't say that, even in fun.

1524
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:01,970
我有一刻被吓住了，我以为…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was frightened for a minute. I really thought....

1525
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:04,950
你真的会做这种最野最难以预料的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You do such wild and unpredictable things.

1526
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:06,740
别傻了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, don't be silly.

1527
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:08,730
你要去俯首认罪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're taking the fall.

1528
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:16,600
你一直在玩弄我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've been playing with me.

1529
01:35:17,130 --> 01:35:19,900
假装你关心这样设计我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just pretending you cared to trap me like this.

1530
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:21,840
你一点也不关心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You didn't care at all.

1531
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:24,110
你不爱我！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't love me.

1532
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:26,050
我才不上你的当！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I won't play the sap for you.

1533
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,700
不是这样的，你不能这么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's not like that. You can't say that.

1534
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:29,810
自从我认识你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You never played square with me

1535
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:30,880
你一刻都没有对我诚实过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}since I've known you.

1536
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:34,530
你内心很清楚我爱你 尽管我做了这些事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know deep in your heart that in spite of anything I've done, I love you.

1537
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,700
我不管谁爱谁！我不会上你的当！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't care who loves who. I won't play the sap.

1538
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:40,220
我不会步上德斯派的后尘 我不知道还有多少前车之鉴！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I won't walk in Thursby's and I don't know how many others' footsteps.

1539
01:35:40,290 --> 01:35:43,290
你杀了麦尔斯，所以你要为此负责
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You killed Miles, and you're going over for it.

1540
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:58,440
你怎么可以这样对我，山姆？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How can you do this to me, Sam?

1541
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:02,690
当然，麦尔斯不会比我还要…
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Surely Mr. Archer wasn't as much to you as....

1542
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:16,670
听着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Listen.

1543
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:19,470
这样是没有用的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This won't do any good.

1544
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:23,710
你永远不会了解我 但我要试一次，然后就不会再试了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'll never understand me, but I'll try once and then give it up.

1545
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:27,050
当一个人的拍档遇害 就必须要设法做点事情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When a man's partner is killed, he's supposed to do something.

1546
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,350
不管你对那个人有什么评价
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Doesn't make any difference what you thought of him.

1547
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:32,950
他是你的搭档，你该为此做些事情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He was your partner, and you're supposed to do something about it.

1548
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:36,230
这是私家侦探这行的规矩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And it happens we're in the detective business.

1549
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:39,460
如果伙伴被人杀害
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, when one of your organization gets killed, it's....

1550
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:42,960
就不应该轻易放过凶手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's bad business to let the killer get away with it.

1551
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,670
这对所有私家侦探都不好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bad all around, bad for every detective everywhere.

1552
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:48,080
你不会指望我相信这就是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't expect me to think these things...

1553
01:36:48,150 --> 01:36:49,610
送我给警方的充足理由吧？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-...are sufficient reason for sending me--

1554
01:36:49,690 --> 01:36:52,210
让我说完，然后你再说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Wait till I'm through. Then you can talk.

1555
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:54,480
我没有理由信任你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've no earthly reason to think I can trust you.

1556
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,550
如果我们这次能逃过 我就有把柄在你手中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If I do this and get away with it, you'll have something on me...

1557
01:36:57,630 --> 01:36:59,850
你就可以随时利用我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...that you can use whenever you want to.

1558
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:01,420
既然我也有你的把柄
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Since I've got something on you...

1559
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:05,060
有一天也许你也会赏我一颗子弹
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...I couldn't be sure that you wouldn't put a hole in me someday.

1560
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:07,590
这些问题全是事情的一面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All those are on one side.

1561
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,400
也许有些并不重要，我不会去争论
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe some of them are unimportant. I won't argue about that.

1562
01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:14,210
但看看有多少问题？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But look at the number of them.

1563
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:16,950
而事情的另一面呢？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And what have we got on the other side?

1564
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:21,250
我们有的，也许是你爱我 也许是我爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All we've got is that maybe you love me and maybe I love you.

1565
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:24,840
你知道你是否爱我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know whether you love me or not.

1566
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:31,160
也许我爱你，把你交出后，我会有几天睡不好觉，但一切都会过去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe I do. I'll have some rotten nights after I've sent you over, but that'll pass.

1567
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:38,370
如果我说的一切都没意义
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If all I've said doesn't mean anything to you

1568
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:41,070
就忘了一切，我们就这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}then forget it and we'll make it just this.

1569
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:44,700
我不会，因为我全心想要罔顾后果
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I won't because all of me wants to regardless of consequences.

1570
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:46,650
因为你依赖我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You counted on that with me the same

1571
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:49,210
就像你依赖其他人一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}as you counted on that with all the others.

1572
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:52,710
如果老鹰是真的，你拿到钱了 你会这样对我吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Would you have done this if the falcon had been real and you'd got your money?

1573
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:55,460
不要认为我真的那么坏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't be too sure I'm as crooked as I'm supposed to be.

1574
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:57,950
恶名昭彰也许能带来好生意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That sort of reputation might be good business...

1575
01:37:58,030 --> 01:38:02,090
带来高价位的生意和敌人打交道更容易
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...bringing high-priced jobs and making it easier to deal with the enemy...

1576
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:07,360
更多钱当然是另一件事 比较对你有利
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...but a lot more money would have been one more item on your side of the scales.

1577
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:11,370
如果你爱我，就不需要更多理由
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you'd loved me, you wouldn't have needed any more on that side.

1578
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:24,260
请进
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come in.

1579
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:30,890
嗨，汤姆，逮到他们了吗？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello, Tom. Got them?

1580
01:38:30,970 --> 01:38:32,060
逮到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}POLHAUS: Got them. -Swell.

1581
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:36,400
好极了，这里还有一个，她杀了麦尔斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Here's another one for you. She killed Miles.

1582
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:39,840
我还有一些证据，小子的枪，开罗的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, and I've got some exhibits. The boys' guns, one of Cairo's...

1583
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:42,750
想要贿赂我的1千元
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...and a $1,000 bill I was supposed to be bribed with.

1584
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:46,410
还有那个黑雕像，一切都是因它而起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And this black statuette here that all the fuss was about.

1585
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:48,660
你的同伴怎么了？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's the matter with your playmate?

1586
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:50,120
看起来心碎了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He looks brokenhearted.

1587
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:52,680
我打赌他听到顾德曼的故事后 以为逮住我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I bet when he heard Gutman's story, he thought he had me.

1588
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,330
别说了，山姆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Cut it out, Sam.

1589
01:38:55,570 --> 01:38:58,200
我们走吧，回去局子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, shall we be getting down to the hall?

1590
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:10,910
真重
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's heavy.

1591
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:12,650
这是什么？
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What is it?

1592
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,550
这是人类梦想的原料
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The stuff that dreams are made of.
