1
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:23,136
<赛末点>

3
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,841
有人说 '本事好不如运气好'
the man who said, 'l'd rather be lucky than good,'

4
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:19,108
说的一点也不错
saw deeply into life.

5
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:23,108
人们害怕生活中什么都要依赖运气
People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck.

6
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:27,175
他们害怕事情超出自己的控制
lt's scary to think so much is out of one's control.

7
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,976
在网球比赛中 球经常会击中网的上沿
there are moments in a match when the ball hits the top of the net,

8
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:36,810
在那瞬间 球有可能越过球网或者弹回来
and for a split second it can either go forward or fall back.

9
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:41,744
如果运气好，它就会越过球网 而你赢得比赛
With a little luck, it goes forward and you win.

10
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,244
又或者它弹回来 你输掉比赛
Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.

11
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:51,111
对不起
Sorry.

12
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:58,112

18
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,847

Now, l've heard very good things. You don't miss playing professionally?

19
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:20,647
我很高兴没有参加
l thank God every day l don't have to do it.

20
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:24,081
我讨厌网球巡回赛
l hate the whole tennis tour thing.

21
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:28,482
没完没了的训练 而且我不可能成为卢斯基或者阿加西那样的好手
Oonstant traveling, and l was never going to be Rusedski or Agassi.

22
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,348
没必要非往那方面发展
You have to really want it.

23
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:32,315
虽然我有他们的天赋
Not that l have their talent.

24
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:35,482
你的证书和推荐信都非常不错
Well, your credentials and references are excellent.

25
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:37,382
你想在伦敦生活?
And you want to live in London?

26
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,516

31
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:56,218

Which is great, you know, 'cause you can be watching some telly,

32
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:58,351
看累了也不用走去卧室
ain't got the hassle of having to go to a bedroom.

33
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:00,818

风景也不错，可以远眺
Lovely view, not overlooked.

38
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:12,386
所有的东西都不错
So it's all good.

39
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,986
一周要225英镑?
this is 225 a week?

40
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:18,753
这可是伦敦耶，如果你想便宜点的 可以到利兹找找看
Well, it's London, mate. Bang, mate. lf you don't like it, move to Leeds.

41
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,620
了解我的意思吗 你有锅吗
D'you know what l mean? You got a wok?

我想克里斯会是你的好教练
l think Ohris would be the perfect instructor for you,

51

and he's very patient. Great at analyzing a player's faults.

52
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:14,025
我很久没打了 大学毕业后就没有打过
l'm so out of practice. l mean, l haven't played since university,

53
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,392
我以前很喜欢打 不过好多年没打了
and l loved it, but l haven't picked up a racket in bloody ages, so...

54
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,959
没关系 状态会回来的
Don't worry, it comes back.

55
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,693
只要别急于求成 别气馁就行了
What you can't do is rush in, be discouraged.

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,060
没问题
Ok.

57

你觉得谁厉害一点 哈曼还是阿加西
Ok, so who was better, or tougher? Henman or Agassi?

60
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:45,495
 他们都很厉害 我知道，我的意思是
they were both great. Yeah, l know, but l mean,

61
00:04:45,562 --> 00:04:47,429
你心里面更倾向谁
you held your own more than admirably.

62
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:48,929
很难说
For a while.

63
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:51,496
比赛的时候 你会发现他们真的很棒
But as the game goes on, you see how really good they are.

64
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,363
 我来买单 不
Actually, l'll get this. No, no, no, no.

No, please, tom, l insist. l insist. No, no, no, no, no.

66
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,863
把你慷慨的手挪开吧
Get your dirty great forehand off.

67
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,263
谢谢 下次我买单
thank you. l'll get the next one.

68
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:04,130
待会你要去举重吗
So, do you need a lift after this?

69
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:07,797
事实上，我想去找家音像店 我想买些唱片
Actually, l'm looking for a music store. l want to buy some ODs.

70
00:05:07,864 --> 00:05:11,564
这附近吗 我想富汉路上有一家
Music around here? l think there's one on the Fulham Road.

71
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:13,731
那里有没有歌剧买
And they'll have a decent opera section?

72
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:15,865
歌剧 你喜欢歌剧, 真的吗
Opera? You like opera, really?

73
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:17,165
我热爱歌剧
l love opera.

74
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:20,365
我爸要我们陪他去 皇家加文花园看歌剧
Papa gives loads to the Royal in Oovent Garden.

75
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:22,332
我知道这有点唐突
l know this is gonna sound a bit weird,

76
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,732
但你有兴趣明晚一起去吗
but would you like to go to the opera tomorrow night?

77
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:27,799
到歌剧院去?
to the opera?

78
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,366
是的，我们订了包厢 有空出来的票
Yeah. We've got a box and someone's not coming.

79
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,900
上演《La bloody traviata》
lt's La bloody traviata.

80
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:36,034
天啊，我非常愿意
My God. l'd love to.

81
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,967
你不是听我说喜欢就这样说的吧? 至少能让我付自己的门票吧?
Are you sure it's not an imposition? Oan l at least pay for my seat?

82
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:41,634
当然不是 你能来是我们的荣幸
lt's not an imposition, it'd be an absolute pleasure.

83
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:45,868
我非常高兴你我都喜欢歌剧
l just like the fact that we both share a love for opera. Brilliant.

84
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:48,968
So?

85
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:52,035
 我跟大卫和玛丽纱说... 大家晚上好，妈妈，你好
l said to David and Melissa... Evening all. Hello, Mum.

this is Ohris. this is my father Alec. Hello. Good to meet you.

88
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:59,069
我听说你的网球很厉害
l hear you're an incredible tennis player.

89
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:01,903
我以前也玩过网球，后来放弃了 再后来重新打，没多久又放弃了
l played once, and then l gave up, then l went back, then l gave up,

90
00:06:02,003 --> 00:06:03,170
 然后我又开始打 废话
then l went back Rubbish.

91
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,903
 一定是汤姆把我夸大其辞了 现在我又不想打了
l'm sure tom exaggerated my game. l just got bored.

92
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:08,003
 晚上好，很荣幸认识你 你好
Good evening. My pleasure. Nice to meet you.

l'm Ohloe. Nice to meet you. there's two more.

95
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:07,176
老家伙很感谢你送他们漂亮的花
Yeah, well, the olds say thank you very much for the lovely flowers.

96
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:10,376
他们说你非常体贴 还叫你不用这么客气的
they said it was very thoughtful, and totally unnecessary.

97
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:14,810
但我要谢谢你，做的非常好 他们就喜欢别人送他们花
But off the record, well done, A plus, 'cause they love that sort of thing.

98
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,444
他们都很平易近人 你妹妹也很漂亮
Oh, they're lovely people. And your sister's very bright.

99
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:21,177
有时候脾气不好
Frighteningly so at times. But...

100
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:24,244
总而言之，她很喜欢你 她想邀请你到
Anyway, she thought you were terrific, and she wanted to invite you

101
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,245
我们的乡间别墅 和我的父母一起过周末
to our country house with the parents on Sunday.

102
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:30,278
那天会有个派对 有不少名人参加
'Oause they're having a party, there'll be some good people.

103
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:34,679
你还可以听到一些经典的音乐 因为我老爸是音乐收藏发烧友
And l'll play you some great music, because Dad's got an epic collection.

104
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:54,881
克洛伊 你想陪克里斯打会球吗
Ohlo Ohlo, do you wanna have a knock with Ohris for a bit?

105
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:56,848
现在已经5点了，亲爱的
lt's just that it's 5:00 somewhere, darling,

106
00:07:56,914 --> 00:07:59,048
我要去调鸡尾酒了
and l've some serious cocktails to start making.

107
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:02,148
爱尔兰人 你喝过古巴ibre和caipirinha没
lrish! Have you ever had a Ouba libre or a caipirinha?

108
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,682
只和我打 克里斯会觉得无聊的
lt'd be really boring for Ohris to play with me on my own.

109
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:07,482
他陪我打也很无聊 但他打的不错
lt's really boring for him to play with me, but he's a good sport.

110
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:10,349
而且，他更喜欢和美女打球呢
And anyway, you've got better legs than l've got. Ohop chop.

111
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,383
别害怕 我以前还教连球拍都没拿过的人呢
Don't be silly. l teach people who have never held a racket before.

112
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,316
 我真的很差劲 那你跟我学习
l'm so bad. that's how you get better.

113
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,216
就能变厉害点，来吧
Playing with a stronger player. Oome on.

114
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:20,017
好的
Ok.

115
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,285
我是不是很烂
Was l dreadful?

116
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:44,119
一点也不烂 你有与众不同的球风
Not at all. You have a very unique style.

117
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:48,086
是啊，笨拙的球风 对了，你怎么打得这么好
Yeah, it's called clumsy. How did you get to be so good anyway?

118
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,486
汤姆说你跟一些职业高手交过手
tom says you played with some of the real greats.

119
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:53,420
对我来说 那样只是为了摆脱贫困
For me, it was a way out of a poor existence.

120
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:56,487
想引起好教练的注意罢了
Oaught the eye of a good coach. l don't know.

121
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:59,587
刚开始还挺容易的
lt all came so easy at first.

122
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:02,221
 你喜欢教人练球吗 并不尽然
Do you enjoy teaching? Not really.

123
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:04,221
我是说，还好吧
l mean, it's Ok for now,

124
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:07,021
不过如果要我当一辈子教练的话 就没意思了
but l'd cut my throat if l thought l had to do it forever.

125
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:08,922
我希望可以做些其他的
l'd like to do something with my life.

126
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:12,589
有意义一点的 我希望能够出人头地
You know, special. l'd like to make a contribution.

127
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:15,922
看来你是一个从爱尔兰来伦敦的 有志气的穷人
So, you're a poor boy from lreland come to London.

128
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,722
没错
l love it.

129
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:20,189
这里让人激情膨拜
lt's so exciting and alive.

130
00:09:20,256 --> 00:09:22,590
我从没见过这么多的艺术品和歌剧院
l've never seen so much art or theater.

131
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:24,856
现在我可以好好欣赏了
Not that l've taken much advantage of it yet.

132
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:27,590
如果你想找人 带你到周围逛逛的话
Well, look, if you'd like someone to show you around,

133
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:31,390
我很乐意带你去些好地方逛逛 我从小在贝格维亚长大（上流住宅区）
l grew up in Belgravia. l'd be happy to take you to all the good places.

134
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:32,691
那太好了
that'd be great.

135
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:36,724
但得让我来买门票
On one condition: l buy the tickets.

136
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,558
没问题 那是命令吗
Oh, dear, is that going to be an issue?

137
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,358
我想是吧 我这人有点传统
l'm afraid it is. l'm very old fashioned.

138
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:44,125
我以前有看过
But actually, l did read something about the...

139
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:46,492
萨赤戏院展览会的一些资料
...exhibition in the Saatchi Gallery.

140
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:50,459
那里太棒了 我很乐意陪你去看看
that's perfect. lt'd be my pleasure to take you.

141
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:52,726
你愿意真是太好了
You're very kind to offer this.

142
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:55,193
我可以免费给你上几堂课作为补偿吗
Oan l at least give you some free tennis lessons?

143
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,960
好的，没问题
Ok, it's a deal.

144
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:59,427
星期三去怎么样
How about Wednesday for the Saatchi?

145
00:09:59,493 --> 00:10:00,993
没问题
l can do that.

146
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,527
 我们是不是先碰面吃过午饭再去 就这么说定了
Shall we meet for lunch first? lt's a date.

147
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:07,327
我想现在我最好先去洗刷一下 客人就要到了
l'd better get ready. Your guests will be arriving soon.

148
00:10:07,394 --> 00:10:09,294
对..当然，去吧
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Go.

149
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:12,561
满头大汗的网球运动员 可不是他们现在想见到的
A sweaty tennis player's hardly what they expect.

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,334
谁会是我下一个手下败将
So who's my next victim?

151
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:14,667
你吗
You?

152
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:17,268
我很久没打乒乓球了
l haven't played table tennis in quite a while.

153
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:20,835
一千英镑一局怎么样
Would you like to play for a thousand pounds a game?

154
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:24,268
形势严峻啊
What did l walk into?

155
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:37,603
形势严峻啊
What did l walk into?

156
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,937
应该这样
lt's like this.

157
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:43,737
 可以吗 请
May l? Please.

158
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:50,004
用球拍斜着击球
You have to lean in, and hit through the ball.

159
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:55,838
没见到你前我也是这么打的
l was doing just fine until you showed up.

160
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:58,072
假的不能再假了
the story of my life.

161
00:11:58,138 --> 00:11:59,572
说说看
So, tell me,

162
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,439
一个美丽，年轻的美国乒乓球选手
what's a beautiful, young, American Ping Pong player doing

163
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:04,739
怎么会出现在英国的上流社会中
mingling amongst the British upper class?

164
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,873
有人跟你提过 你很自以为是吗
Did anyone ever tell you, you play a very aggressive game?

165
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:19,474
有人跟你提过 你有非常性感的嘴唇吗
Did anyone ever tell you you've very sensual lips?

166
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:26,875
 极端自以为是 有一说一而已
Extremely aggressive. l'm naturally competitive.

167
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:29,942
那样说让你不高兴吗
ls it off putting?

168
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,375
我得想想看是不是
l'll have to think about that for a while.

169
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:38,943
原来你在这
there you are.

170
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,076
我给你介绍 这位是克里斯·维尔顿
l wanted to introduce you to Ohris Wilton.

171
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:44,176
克里斯·维尔顿 这是诺拉·赖斯，我未婚妻
Ohris Wilton, this is Nola Rice, my fiancee.

172
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:48,444
原来你就是那个网球教练
So, you're the tennis pro.

173
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:50,510
 你好啊，亲爱的 很荣幸认识你
Hello, darling. My pleasure.

174
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,944
他刚才赢了我了
He was trying to have his way with me over the table.

175
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:55,811
哦，是吗 那你得留心了
Oh, really? Yeah, well, you'd better watch out for this one.

176
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:57,878
他可是靠这个混饭吃的
He's made a living out of hustling.

177
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,978
下一次我会有所准备的
l'll be ready for you next time.

178
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:06,379
 我在外面等你 好
l'll see you outside. Oh, yeah.

179
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:15,480
有种很特别的气质，是吧
She's quite something, isn't she?

180
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,680
 你们在一起多久了 六个月
How long have you been together? Six months.

181
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:22,847
天哪，才六个月
Jesus, yeah, six months!

182
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:25,347
她到伦敦学表演 我们在一个派对上认识
She came over to study acting, and l met her at a party

183
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:27,514
一见钟情，结果...
that l'd crashed and she'd crashed, and...

184
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:30,248
就订婚了
...one thing led to another.

185
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:34,015
事实上 我老妈很长时间都不能接受
Obviously, it's taken Mother quite a long time to get used to the idea

186
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:35,615
我对她那么认真这个事实
that l'm serious about her, but...

187
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:36,682
和你老实说吧
to be honest with you,

188
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,082
我妈经常私底下问我
Mother's always had this funny little agenda for me

189
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:42,416
是不是真的要和这个女演员结婚
which doesn't really involve marrying a struggling actress.

190
00:13:42,482 --> 00:13:44,582
况且还是个美国人
Especially an American one.

191
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:48,550
但我实在太喜欢她了
But l am crazy about her.

192
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:52,317
说回来，我觉得我们下周可以一起去吃顿饭 你觉得怎么样
Anyway, l think we should all go to dinner next week. What do you think?

193
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,383
 没问题 好极了
l'd love to. Excellent.

194
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,984
现在呢，爱尔兰人 晚饭前来点苏格兰酒怎么样
Now, lrish, how about a little drop of Scottish before supper?

195
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,384
 不错 走撒，快点
Why not. Lead on. Quickly.

196
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,855
这几天下午我很开心
these afternoons have been great.

197
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:47,889
我很高兴你有这么多时间陪我
l'm so glad your schedule allows you so much time off.

198
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,556
是啊，很开心
Yes, it's fun.

199
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,289
多开几个小学生课程就补回来了
Although it wouldn't hurt to have a few more pupils.

200
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:56,523
你缺钱吗
Do you need money?

201
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,390
当然不
God, no.

202
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:00,257
不，不需要
No, l'm fine.

203
00:15:00,323 --> 00:15:03,024
谢谢你的好意 但我真的不缺钱
lt's very sweet of you to ask, but l don't.

204
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:12,691
我这样问是因为我在乎你
l'm only asking because l care about you.

205
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:33,260
去你那还是去我那
Shall we go to your place or mine?

206
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:35,594
我想我家你一定不习惯
l don't think mine's quite what you're used to.

207
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,561
闭嘴，我想你家一定不错
Shut up. l think yours'll be just great.

208
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:02,863
我知道你最近常和克里斯·维尔顿在一起
You've been seeing a lot of Ohris Wilton lately, l understand.

209
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:06,563
 是啊，他人不错 我喜欢他
Yeah. He's very nice. l liked him.

210
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,397
我只是不知道他的理想是什么
l just don't understand what he's aiming for.

211
00:16:09,464 --> 00:16:12,331
他肯定不想一辈子都当网球教练
He certainly doesn't want to be a tennis pro for the rest of his life.

212
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:14,664
我也觉得他讨人喜欢
Well, l find him very likeable.

213
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:18,198
靠唯一的本事闯出生天 让人敬佩
He's fought his way up the only way open to him, and he's not trivial.

214
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:22,532
我和他有过非常愉快的谈话
l had a very interesting conversation the other day about Dostoyevsky.

215
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,598
我们能不能帮帮他
Oan't we do something for him?

216
00:16:24,665 --> 00:16:26,965
在你的公司给他个职位什么的
A place in one of your companies or something?

217
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:28,332
他要你这样说的吗
Has he expressed a desire?

218
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,066
不是，但是，他很关心自己的前途 你知道的
No, but... he's open, you know, about his future.

219
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,366
他很想出人头地
He really wants to make something of his life.

220
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:36,500
克洛伊, 小心点
Ohloe, be careful.

221
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,533
汤姆已经和那个我不喜欢的女人搞的昏天暗地了 你不要也这样
tom's involved with a woman l have reservations about. Don't rush off.

222
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,500
汤姆和诺拉在一起很开心 你不喜欢她只是因为她是美国人
tom's happy with Nola. You're prejudiced 'cause she's American.

223
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,434
她被宠坏了 而且喜怒无常
She's spoilt and temperamental.

224
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,367
她是演员，情绪化很正常
She's an actress, they're emotional.

225
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:50,668
她对前途一片茫然, 而且喜怒无常 根本不适合汤姆
She's deluding herself, and she's moody. She's not right for tom.

226
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,968
反正我很喜欢克里斯 而且我想他对我也有一样的感觉
Well, l care very deeply for Ohris, and l think he feels the same way.

227
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:56,402
 你们到底在说谁啊 诺拉
Who are you talking about? Nola.

228
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:11,536
 是不是等了很久了 没有
Have you been waiting ages? Hello. Not at all.

229
00:17:11,603 --> 00:17:14,070
交通太糟糕了 他们俩还得等会才到
traffic was awful. the others'll be here in a minute.

230
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,037
可能在哪里塞车了
they're probably stuck in it somewhere.

231
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:18,037
给我一杯香槟鸡尾酒，谢谢
Oan l have a champagne cocktail, please?

232
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:24,304
你爸爸的一个同事今天找过我 谈了一些工作的事情
One of your father's associates spoke to me today about the possibility of a job.

233
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:25,971
你是不是和你爸说了什么
Did you say anything?

234
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:30,405
我只是叫老爸留意一下 如果有什么好点的职位
Look, l just told Papa to keep his eyes open if anything juicy opened up,

235
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:33,305
可以优先让你试试 如果你喜欢的话
so you could have first option, if you wanted it.

236
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:36,072
 你不想这样, 是吗 当然不
You're not cross, are you? God, no.

237
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,006
你对我真是太体贴了
lt's extremely thoughtful of you.

238
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:42,573
谢谢
thanks.

239
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

240
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,707
我得好好考虑一下
l'm gonna have to think about it.

241
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:50,607
我从来没做过生意
l've never really seen myself in the business world.

242
00:17:53,174 --> 00:17:57,441
那你对自己的未来怎么看
So, what do you see for yourself, you know, in the future?

243
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:00,175
我不知道，真的
l don't know, really.

244
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:04,742
我是说 我知道这是一个很好的机遇
l mean, l'm sure it's a great opportunity.

245
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:06,542
本来就是
l think it is.

246
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:09,976
爸爸说这是一个学习做生意的好机会
Papa said it's a chance to learn the business.

247
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:13,709
如果你做的好 他会知道的
And if things go well, he'll see to it, you know, that...

248
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:15,976
你会提升的很快
...you move up quickly, or whatever.

249
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,910
我对办公室工作没多少感觉
l've always felt so so about office work.

250
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:22,077
这不完全是办公室工作
lt's not exactly office work.

251
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:25,611
把它想象成阶梯要好点
think of it more as a stepping stone.

252
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:26,744
到哪里
to?

253
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:30,778
到一个更重要，更多责任
to a biggerjob, more responsibility,

254
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:33,778
更高收入的职位什么的
greater earning potential, l don't know.

255
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:38,912
你不是一直说 你很敬佩我爸爸的造诣的吗
You've always said how much you admire Papa's accomplishments.

256
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,212
当然
Of course.

257
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,446
我是说，这有点奇怪 我知道那么多的人
l mean, it's strange, but coming where l come from,

258
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:47,646
但我就只敬佩你爸爸这样的人
l've always admired men like your father.

259
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:50,146
富有但不乏味
Wealthy, but not stuffy.

260
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,247
创造财富的同时
Enjoying his fortune.

261
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:55,480
还喜欢欣赏艺术
Having a grand time, supporting the arts.

262
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:58,914
说真的，他真的想帮帮你
Well, he'd really like to open some doors for you, that's all.

263
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:00,814
他还是个慷慨的人
He's a very generous man.

264
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:04,681
他欣赏你有上进心和反对不平等
He respects how you've pulled yourself up, against the odds.

265
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:11,215
 你看上去不是很感兴趣 对不起
You don't seem very enthusiastic. l'm sorry.

266
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:13,149
我希望我的犹豫没有让你不开心
l hope my hesitation isn't upsetting.

267
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:16,016
不，不，一点都不 是应该考虑考虑的
No, no, not at all. lt's just that, you know,

268
00:19:16,082 --> 00:19:19,716
你总是在说想出人头地...对不起
you've always talked about making a contribution and... l'm sorry.

269
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,216
我会的，我保证
l will. l promise.

270
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:25,350
 哦，来了 好啊
Oh, good. Hello.

271
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:26,650
你们好，伙计们
Hi, guys.

272
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:29,084
你好
Hello.

273
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:35,551
交通真是太糟糕了
Don't worry, the traffic was awful.

274
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:39,318
我的错 我把诺拉拉去看车展了
lt's my fault, l dragged Nola to the classic car show at ExOeL.

275
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:41,385
 是吗 难以置信
Really? lt was unbelievable.

276
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:43,285
我发誓 我的裤子差不多干了
l swear, my trousers have barely dried.

277
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:44,552
哦，天啊，闭嘴
Oh, God. Shut up.

278
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:46,219
你也喜欢车，是吗 克里斯
You love your cars, don't you, Ohris?

279
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,419
 我觉得老式车好看一点 我也比较喜欢老式车
l think the old ones are beautiful. Yeah, l like the old ones.

280
00:19:49,486 --> 00:19:53,353
但汤姆喜欢那些新款的 带些小饰物的那种
But tom likes all those new ones with the gadgets and...

281
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:55,620
我想要一辆阿斯顿马丁车
l want an Aston Martin.

282
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:57,586
 我开过阿斯顿马丁 真的吗
l drove an Aston Martin. Really?

283
00:19:57,653 --> 00:20:01,053
是的，以前我替一个人做事 经常帮他洗车
Yeah, l used to work for a man, and l used to wash his cars for him.

284
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,220
 他非常非常溺爱 谢谢
He was very, very particular about thank you.

285
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,254
他的车所以我不得不每天都要用牙刷来洗
taking care of them, so l had to wash them every day with a toothbrush.

286
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:11,054
我想要一辆阿斯顿马丁车 或者老式的敞蓬车
l want an Aston Martin, or one of those vintage convertible Mercedes.

287
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:14,288
没问题，等我们结婚后 我们就开始收藏老式车
Well, when we're married we'll collect vintage cars.

288
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:17,488
只要给我一辆破DB9车就行了 好吗
Just as long as l can have a DB9 with all the trimmings. Ok?

289
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:20,155
实际上 海德雷对收藏车最在行了
ln fact, Hedley is perfect for keeping all those cars.

290
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:23,622
 说起海德雷 我们是不是该点菜了，他在等了
ln fact, speaking of Hedley... Should we order, 'cause he's waiting.

291
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,423
真不好意思 我要一份烤马铃薯拌蘑菇
Frightfully sorry. l'll have the baked potato with truffles.

292
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:28,823
 那太好吃了 我也要那种
that'll be lovely. Yum yum. l'd like the same, please.

293
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,890
要不要来些前点
Nothing to start?

294
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:32,557
我看看酒单再说
Oh, l think the wine list.

295
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:36,057
我要一份俄式鱼子酱薄煎饼 谢谢
l'll have the caviar blinis, please.

296
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:38,957
 我要烤鸡吧 不是吧
Roast chicken. God, boring!

297
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:41,624
跟你说吧 他们这里的俄式鱼子酱薄煎饼很不错
Honestly, they have the greatest caviar blinis here.

298
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:43,424
 你应该尝尝 无所谓了
You should try them. that's Ok.

299
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:46,425
 别，你喜欢鱼子酱吗 一般般
No, do you like caviar? So so.

300
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:48,025
一般般
'So so.'

301
00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:52,059
真不好意思 他从小就被教育的不尝试新菜品
He's been brought up as a good boy, to always order modestly. l'm very sorry.

302
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,059
给他份薄煎饼吧
He'll have the blinis.

303
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,859
天啊 你老爸在礼节上对你很严厉吗
My goodness, was your father an oil rigger who specialized in etiquette?

304
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:59,859
他是有点严厉
He was kind of austere.

305
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,093
克里斯的爸爸是一个虔诚的信徒
Ohris's dad was a bit of a religious fanatic.

306
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
哦，不可思异
Oh, Ohrist.

307
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:05,160
他失掉两条腿后 就开始信奉耶稣了
After he lost both his legs, he found Jesus.

308
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:09,627
天啊，对不起 但看上去这交易划不来
God. Sorry, but itjust doesn't seem like a fair trade.

309
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:12,994
刚才你在说海德雷什么
What were you saying about Hedley?

310
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:15,761
 爸爸邀请我们一起去狩猎 真的吗
Papa's invited us for some shooting. Oh, really?

311
00:21:15,828 --> 00:21:17,661
我最好换一套衣服再去
l'd better bring a different change of clothes.

312
00:21:17,728 --> 00:21:20,328
我想你妈妈不喜欢 我上次去时穿的衣服
l don't think your mother appreciated what l brought last time.

313
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:23,195
我想是因为你的泳衣 她更喜欢针织品
l think that was your swimsuit. She's used to slightly more fabric.

314
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:27,062
我肯定如果她知道你在电影里面穿针织品的话 她对你会改观的
l'm sure if she knew you'd worn it in a movie, she'd suddenly find it chic.

315
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,696
 确实 你拍过很多电影吗
true. Have you done many movies?

316
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:32,363
只是一些商业广告 不是电影
lt was a commercial, not a movie.

317
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:35,296
但你从没有放弃拍电影的梦想
But your eyes went straight to her, if you know what l mean.

318
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:39,030
我的事业并不像计划的那样发展
l don't think my career has... really gone as planned.

319
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,530
你只是需要喘口气
Oh, you just need a break.

320
00:21:40,597 --> 00:21:42,730
我觉得运气也很重要
l think it's important to be lucky in anything.

321
00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:44,931
我不相信运气 我相信实干
Well, l don't believe in luck. l believe in hard work.

322
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:46,764
实干是必须的
Oh, hard work is mandatory,

323
00:21:46,831 --> 00:21:50,064
但我想所有人都不能否认运气的存在
but l think everybody's afraid to admit what a big part luck plays.

324
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:52,331
科学家都越来越确认
l mean, it seems scientists are...

325
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:56,265
偶然运气的存在
...confirming more and more that all existence is here by blind chance.

326
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:59,265
没什么目的, 突然就出现了
No purpose, no design.

327
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:01,966
我才不管这个 随缘吧
Well, l don't care, l love every minute of it.

328
00:22:02,032 --> 00:22:03,932
我正羡慕你这一点
And l envy you for it.

329
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,033
牧师经常说的 是什么来着
What was it the... the vicar used to say?

330
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,733
'绝望是反抗的源动力'
'Despair is the path of least resistance.'

331
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,233
老生常谈了，不是吗 有点意思吧
lt was something odd, wasn't it? lt was very strange...

332
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,600
我认为信念才是反抗的源动力
l think that faith is the path of least resistance.

333
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,967
 哦, 天哪 哦, 天哪
Oh, God. Oh, God.

334
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,667
我们不能换个话题吗
Oan we change the subject, please?

335
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:21,034
诺拉不是在说表演的事吗 那个更有意思一点
Nola was talking about acting, which is much more interesting.

336
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:22,768
不，我只是说
No, l was...

337
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:27,435
我对自己的演艺有了另外一种看法
...just saying that l think l'm giving acting a second thought.

338
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:31,935
受不了家乡的人认为我失败了
l just can't bear people in my hometown to think l've failed.

339
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,669
现在我永远都不想再回到科罗拉多州去了
Not that l'm ever going back to Oolorado.

340
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:36,036
永远
Ever.

341
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:38,569
你选好酒了吗
Have you decided on a wine?

342
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:42,603
两瓶Puligny Montrachet（酒名） 谢谢
two bottles of Puligny Montrachet. thank you.

343
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:43,003
早上好，我是克里斯·威尔顿 罗德·卡瓦
Good morning. Ohris Wilton. Rod Oarver.

344
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:44,770
 上午好，克里斯·维尔顿 罗德·卡沃
Good morning. Ohris Wilton. Rod Oarver.

345
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,070
 很高兴见到你 很高兴见到你
Good to meet you. Good to meet you.

346
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,637
你跟着艾伦·辛克莱办事
You'll be working under Alan Sinclair here.

347
00:22:49,737 --> 00:22:51,004
艾伦，你好
Hi, Alan. How are you?

348
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,671
刚开始 你可能会觉得分配工作没有什么挑战性
At first, you may find the assignments a little unchallenging,

349
00:22:54,737 --> 00:22:57,904
但很快你就会发现 这里情况变化很快
but that'll soon change as you appreciate how things wash here.

350
00:22:57,971 --> 00:22:59,938
 上班时间是朝九晚五 好的
lt's basically nine to five. Yes, yes.

351
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,705
所以你还是有很多时间打网球的 如果你想的话
So you'll have plenty of time to keep up the backhand, if you like.

352
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:04,505
如果你已经安顿好了的话
Now, if you're Ok with the package,

353
00:23:04,572 --> 00:23:06,739
这个月初就开始上班吧
we'd like to begin the first of the month.

354
00:23:06,805 --> 00:23:08,606
我肯定薪水不是问题
l'm sure the salary won't be a problem.

355
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:10,739
 很高兴认识你, 艾伦 很高兴认识你
Good to meet you, Alan. Good. And you.

356
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,806
还有你，罗德
And Rod.

357
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:13,073
 在这里你会过的很愉快 我相信我会
l'm sure you'll be happy here. l'm sure l will.

358
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:14,506
 前途无量 谢谢
Exciting things are happening. Ok.

359
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,707
你得到那份工作 你不知道我有多开心
l can't tell you how happy l am you've taken thatjob.

360
00:23:21,807 --> 00:23:24,340
实在太令人激动了
lt's such good news.

361
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:28,074
给 我买了这个送给你作为庆祝
Here, l brought you this to celebrate.

362
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:30,608
喔，谢谢
Wow. thank you.

363
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:35,142
照我看 你很快就能获得提升
Believe me, in no time you'll be running that division.

364
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:39,009
你比艾伦·辛克莱能干多了 虽然他也挺能干
You're so much more on the ball than Alan Sinclair. He's nice, but...

365
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:42,742
 但他不够上进 这种唱片很稀有
...uninspiring. lt's very rare.

366
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:44,776
上面有一些优美的独唱曲
lt has some beautiful arias on it.

367
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:46,576
而且他的声音唱出了
And his voice expresses

368
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:48,976
生活中所有悲惨的事情
everything that's tragic about life.

369
00:23:49,676 --> 00:23:52,743
 你喜欢悲剧，是吗 你呢
You find it tragic, do you? And you?

370
00:23:56,544 --> 00:23:58,511
我喜欢它
l love it.

371
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:04,711
让我们在家共进晚餐 顺便听听悲剧
Let's stay at home and have dinner, and listen to the tragedy.

372
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,312
我去开瓶酒给你
l'm gonna open one of those bottles of wine l got you.

373
00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:11,979
Puligny Montrachet（酒名）
Puligny Montrachet.

374
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:14,345
汤姆下订前我从没听说过这种酒
l never heard of it before tom ordered it.

375
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,746
现在我却爱上它了
Now l'm addicted.

376
00:24:15,812 --> 00:24:18,546
汤姆和诺拉请我们今晚一起去看电影
tom and Nola invited us to go and see a film with them tonight,

377
00:24:18,613 --> 00:24:20,313
但我已经和他们说我们今晚没时间了
but l told them we're busy.

378
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:25,013
我们没什么节目啊
But we have no plans.

379
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,080
没什么特别要做的事情
Well, no special plans.

380
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,980
我以为我们说好了留在家里的
l thought we said we'd stay in?

381
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,647
是啊，不过我们可以改啊
Yeah, but it wasn't written in stone.

382
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:35,281
我们应该和他们一起去的
We could've joined them.

383
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:37,848
现在也可以啊 如果你喜欢的话
We still can, if you'd prefer it.

384
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:43,282
这不是喜不喜欢的问题 只是
lt's... it's not a case of preferring it, it's just...

385
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:47,349
和他们一起总是很开心 而且你喜欢看电影
...we always have fun with them, and you love films.

386
00:24:47,415 --> 00:24:49,716
那现在要打给他们吗
Well, shall l call them?

387
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:54,416
我是说，当然 除非你不想去
l mean, sure, unless you'd rather not.

388
00:24:55,783 --> 00:24:57,783
其实
Well...

389
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,750
就我们两个可能更有意思
lt might be more fun, just the two of us.

390
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:03,317
有酒有歌剧
the wine, the opera.

391
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,384
当然
Absolutely.

392
00:25:15,885 --> 00:25:17,752
我只是觉得
l just figured...

393
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:21,385
二人世界什么时候都可以过
We can stay in any... any night, and...

394
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:24,486
而他们难得请我们看电影
...they're free and suggested a film.

395
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:25,886
什么电影
What's the film?

396
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:28,586
我不知道 但如果你想去
l don't know, but if you'd prefer it.

397
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,553
我想去看电影
l am in the mood for a film.

398
00:25:37,754 --> 00:25:39,754
非常感谢，伙计
thank you so much, fella.

399
00:25:40,454 --> 00:25:44,955
等一下，门打不开 可以了
Hello. Oh, hang on, l'm having problems with the door. there we go.

400
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,188
嗨, 伙计们 等一下
Hello, sweetie. Hi, guys. One second.

401
00:25:48,855 --> 00:25:50,822
给你，伙计 非常感谢
there you go, fella. thanks so much.

402
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:53,289
愿考文垂队好运 对啊
Good luck with the Sky Blues. Oh, yeah, cheers.

403
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:55,322
诺拉呢
Where is she?

404
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:58,856
诺拉得了偏头痛 今晚来不了了
Nola got a migraine at the last moment, and unfortunately she can't make it.

405
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:01,023
 她没事吧 我帮她带了问候
Oh, no. ls she gonna be all right? But she sends her love.

406
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:02,690
没事，过几天就好了
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

407
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:05,857
 看电影喽，《摩托车上的日记》 我敢打赌是她选的电影
Hell with her, Motorcycle Diaries! l bet that was her choice.

408
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:08,424
你怎么可能会想看这种电影
l can't believe this is what you really want to see.

409
00:26:09,924 --> 00:26:12,257
你工作的同事都很喜欢你
Everybody likes you at work.

410
00:26:13,857 --> 00:26:16,924
爸爸说他听到了一个好消息
Papa says he's heard great things.

411
00:26:19,058 --> 00:26:21,658
你同事说你是个聪明的孩子
You're a very clever boy.

412
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:40,993
嘿
Hey!

413
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,694
嘿
Hey.

414
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,394
 嗨 你好啊
Hi. How are you?

415
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,127
 你在这里做什么 刚买了件毛线杉
What are you doing here? l was just looking for a sweater.

416
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:50,994
就汤姆穿的那种 是不是开士米绒
the kind tom has. ls it cashmere?

417
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:53,461
是羊绒
lt's vicuna.

418
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,962
 羊绒 羊绒?
vicuna. vicuna?

419
00:26:55,028 --> 00:26:56,295
 对 哦
Yeah. Right.

420
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:57,428
你去哪
Where are you going?

421
00:26:57,495 --> 00:27:00,162
有一点紧张
Oh, l'm just having a nervous breakdown.

422
00:27:00,229 --> 00:27:01,229
为什么
Why? So...

423
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:03,796
10分钟后我有个试镜
Well, l have an audition in ten minutes and...

424
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:08,430
以前的话，我的信心一般都有10 现在却只有0
As usual, my confidence level, which started off at a ten, is now at a zero.

425
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:12,163
 别担心，你会做得很好的 承你贵言，我要迟到了
Don't worry, you'll be great. Yeah. l'm gonna be late, so...

426
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,663
 你想走走吗 是的，当然
Are you walk...? You wanna walk? Yeah, sure.

427
00:27:16,197 --> 00:27:19,197
我的经纪人本来要陪我去的 但他取消了
My agent was supposed to meet me, but he canceled.

428
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:23,531
搞得我一团糟 我一个人去
So that's... awful. l'm alone to...

429
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:26,665
你想我陪你去 作为精神上的支持吗
Would you like me to come along for moral support?

430
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:30,332
 那太好了，如果 好的
Yes. that would be great. lf you... Sure.

431
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,499
 不影响你的话 没问题
lf it's not a problem. lt's not a problem.

432
00:27:32,565 --> 00:27:33,965
 没问题 那好
No, it's not a problem. Ok.

433
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:36,599
以前大型网球比赛前 我都会很紧张
l used to get really tense before big tennis matches.

434
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:39,933
你有试过瑜珈吗
Have you ever tried yoga?

435
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,700
 没有 没有？
No. No?

436
00:28:38,472 --> 00:28:39,939
嗨
Hi.

437
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:42,006
 嗨 哦，嘿
Hello. Hi. Oh, hey.

438
00:28:42,272 --> 00:28:44,873
 怎么样 搞砸了
How was it? Blew that.

439
00:28:44,939 --> 00:28:47,139
在家里做得来的 但是
ltjust works, you know, at home, but...

440
00:28:47,206 --> 00:28:50,806
我不知道 试镜却没没一次
l don't know, l just can never really pull through...

441
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:53,140
 最终成功过 你会的
...in the end. You will. You will.

442
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,540
希望吧
Yeah.

443
00:28:55,774 --> 00:28:56,774
其实
You know what,

444
00:28:56,874 --> 00:28:59,774
我现在很想去喝点酒让自己好受点
l could actually use a drink just to pull myself together...

445
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:01,274
 就一点点 没问题
...a little bit. Sure.

446
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:03,308
 好吧 这边吧
Ok. this way.

447
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:16,676
我说到哪了
What was l saying?

448
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:23,543
我妹妹去大学读了几年书
My sister went to college for a couple of years.

449
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,310
但我和你一样，靠自学
But l'm like you, l'm self taught.

450
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,710
你应该见见我妹妹的 她
You should see my sister, she's...

451
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:33,944
她非常的漂亮 但她迷上了毒品
...she's very beautiful, but she's lost in drugs and...

452
00:29:34,044 --> 00:29:36,811
我肯定她没有你漂亮
l'm sure she's not more beautiful than you are.

453
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:41,445
我是性感美，但琳达
What l am is sexy. But Linda's...

454
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:43,278
我的妹妹
My sister...

455
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:47,112
是古典美
...is classically beautiful.

456
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:52,246
所以你知道你对男人的吸引力?
So, you are aware of your effect on men?

457
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:57,180
在我的父母离异前 他们经常带她去参加选美比赛
Before my parents split, they used to put her in these pageants.

458
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
说笑的
lt's just a joke.

459
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:03,447
你爸爸是做什么的
What did your father do?

460
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:08,248
他遗弃了我们
He... left.

461
00:30:09,414 --> 00:30:11,915
从没寄过钱回来
And never sent any money.

462
00:30:12,015 --> 00:30:14,348
而我的妈妈也没一份工作能做好
And my mother could never hold down a job.

463
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:17,148
 没一份? 对
No? No.

464
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:20,615
她酗酒
Her problem was that she drank.

465
00:30:22,882 --> 00:30:24,883
你怎么认识汤姆的
How did you meet tom?

466
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:30,083
在一个派对上
We met at a party.

467
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,350
他
He...

468
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:33,150
看见我后
...saw me across the room

469
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:37,450
就好象一个追踪导弹一样跟着我
and he honed in on me, like a guided missile.

470
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,951
而我
And l...

471
00:30:39,017 --> 00:30:40,851
马上就爱上他了
l liked him right off, you know.

472
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:42,718
我想
l thought...

473
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,751
我觉得他真的很帅
Well, l think he's very handsome.

474
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:47,051
你不觉得吗
Don't you?

475
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:49,018
是很帅
very.

476
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:51,318
他向你求婚了吗
And he asked you to marry him?

477
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,586
他
Well, he...

478
00:30:55,652 --> 00:31:00,453
送了很多礼物给我
...swept me off of my feet with presents and, you know...

479
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,453
我怎么知道那是什么样的生活
What did l know about that kind of life?

480
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,687
我只是一个来自科罗拉多的穷演员
l'm just a starving actress from Boulder, Oolorado.

481
00:31:05,753 --> 00:31:07,187
除此外
But...

482
00:31:07,653 --> 00:31:11,721
我曾经有一段不如意的婚姻 这也是她不喜欢我的原因
l had another bad marriage behind me. that's another reason she hates me.

483
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,521
 谁 埃莉诺，汤姆的妈妈
Who? Eleanor. tom's mother.

484
00:31:15,688 --> 00:31:18,021
她想他娶一个叫奥利维亚的女孩
She wants him to marry this girl named Olivia,

485
00:31:18,088 --> 00:31:21,088
好像是他的远亲 我不知道，我觉得有点恶心
who l think is a distant cousin. l don't know. lt's... it's sick.

486
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:23,588
肥水不流外人田的家庭
lt's such an inbred family. lt's...

487
00:31:23,655 --> 00:31:26,022
你们是一见钟情吗
And was it love at first sight for you too?

488
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,989
我觉得他很帅
l thought he was very handsome.

489
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:36,056
我刚才提过了，我只是
You know, and l told you l was just...

490
00:31:36,523 --> 00:31:39,557
完全被他俘虏了
l was overwhelmed with attention.

491
00:31:42,357 --> 00:31:44,824
说说你和克洛依吧
So, what about you and Ohloe?

492
00:31:47,857 --> 00:31:49,858
她很可爱
She's very sweet.

493
00:31:52,925 --> 00:31:54,925
她很可爱
She is very sweet.

494
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:59,192
她想嫁给你
And she wants to marry you.

495
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,859
我想她的妈妈也不会同意的
l don't think her mother would approve of that either.

496
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:04,126
不，不，这不一样
No. No, it's different.

497
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:07,659
埃莉诺不买我的帐 但你肯定是
l don't buy into Eleanor, and she knows it, but you...

498
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,726
准新郎
...are being groomed.

499
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:12,460
我不会看错的
You mark my words.

500
00:32:12,527 --> 00:32:15,894
上一次当他们以为 克洛伊跟一个穷小子私奔的时候
they almost died when they thought that Ohloe had run off with some...

501
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,627
他们差点没熬过来
...guy that ran a gastropub in the city.

502
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:20,194
但
But...

503
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:27,328
你有很好的前途 除非你自己搞砸了
You're gonna do very well for yourself, unless you blow it.

504
00:32:28,495 --> 00:32:30,562
我会怎样搞砸呢
And how am l going to blow it?

505
00:32:34,395 --> 00:32:36,529
比如跟我调情
By making a pass at me.

506
00:32:38,763 --> 00:32:41,129
是什么让你觉得会是那样的
And what makes you think that's gonna happen?

507
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:45,697
男人都很好奇
Men always seem to wonder.

508
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:50,830
他们以为我与众不同
they think l'd be something very special.

509
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:52,897
你是吗
And are you?

510
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:58,865
至少没人要求退钱
Well, no one's ever asked for their money back.

511
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:05,365
刚才试镜时不见你如此自信
Where was all this confidence when you needed it in the audition?

512
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:14,166
我喝的太多了
l've had too much to drink.

513
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,666
能帮我叫辆计程车吗
Oan you get me a cab?

514
00:33:17,766 --> 00:33:19,733
当然可以
Sure.

515
00:33:39,502 --> 00:33:40,969
谢谢
thank you.

516
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:43,069
你是不是开的有点快
You were driving a bit fast,

517
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:44,636
 是吗 早上好
weren't you? Good morning.

518
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:47,569
 它在哪 第二格
Which one is he in? Second one over there.

519
00:33:47,636 --> 00:33:48,636
哦，嗨
Oh, hi.

520
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:49,903
你觉得它会好起来来吗
So, do you think he's gonna be all right?

521
00:33:50,003 --> 00:33:52,003
卡米克上周来看过它了
Oarmichael came and had a look at him the other week.

522
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:53,537
他太好了
Oh, he's so sweet.

523
00:33:53,603 --> 00:33:55,537
右后腿有点问题
the problem with the right hind is gonna...

524
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:57,570
差点就被切掉了
lt should have dissipated fully already.

525
00:33:57,637 --> 00:33:59,871
 汤姆, 我可以喂它吗 可以，喂它点干草吧
tom, can l feed him? Yeah, yeah, wack him some hay.

526
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,538
汤姆, 你觉得它周日能参赛吗
tom, do you think he's gonna be able to play on Sunday?

527
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:04,471
它可以参赛 但问题是
Well, he will play on Sunday, but it's just the problem with the fact

528
00:34:04,538 --> 00:34:07,271
只有洛佩斯能够驯服它 而洛佩斯受了伤
that it's only Lopez who can ride him, and he's injured at the moment.

529
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:09,205
我们被伤病拖后腿了
We're having a bloody nightmare with injuries.

530
00:34:09,272 --> 00:34:11,272
你太美了
You're so beautiful.

531
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:16,572
公司准备付钱 让你到学校去修读一个商业课程
What would you say to the idea of taking a business course at school

532
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,939
你觉得怎么样
that the company would pay for?

533
00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:20,573
我不知道
l don't know.

534
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:27,340
你前期的工作 反馈非常不错
l've had very good feedback on your work.

535
00:34:27,707 --> 00:34:29,507
明年年初
And the beginning of next year

536
00:34:29,607 --> 00:34:32,507
公司准备增设一些高级职位
there's going to be a very significant position opening up.

537
00:34:32,574 --> 00:34:36,508
高职责，高薪水
One that carries a great deal of responsibility and pays accordingly.

538
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:39,408
附带一些福利
Plus, there are a number of perks...

539
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:43,508
报销开支啊，司机啊等等
Expense account, driver, et cetera.

540
00:34:43,575 --> 00:34:46,109
我们正在关注适合此职位的人
We had been focusing on someone else...

541
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:50,542
虽然你和克洛伊很亲近
...but it's obvious to me that you and Ohloe have become close.

542
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:53,976
但如果你不符合条件 我一样不会用你
Although l wouldn't consider it, if l didn't think you were qualified.

543
00:34:54,043 --> 00:34:55,643
我不会让您失望的
l'd hate to disappoint you.

544
00:34:56,843 --> 00:34:58,410
 抱歉，来晚了 快点
Oh, excuse me. Oome on, Ohris...

545
00:34:58,477 --> 00:35:00,477
我们都准备好了
We're nearly ready.

546
00:35:00,543 --> 00:35:02,944
 我准备了一支枪给克里斯 谢谢你, 汤姆
l'll bring a gun for Ohris. thanks, tom.

547
00:35:07,877 --> 00:35:08,911
没关系，伙计
Never mind, fella.

548
00:35:09,011 --> 00:35:12,611
松鸡成群的季节很快就到了
this is basically a tune up for the grouse season, which is starting soon.

549
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:15,545
 马上就可以大屠杀了 别吓唬他
But it's bloody good fun. Don't frighten him.

550
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:18,078
他的射击可没网球好
His shooting's not really up to his tennis, poor thing.

551
00:35:18,145 --> 00:35:20,112
我会把他训练成很好的松鸡猎手的
l'll make an accomplished grouse shooter of him yet.

552
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:22,346
 不用担心, 克里斯 希望你可以，爸爸
Don't you worry, Ohris. Quite right, Papa.

553
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,412
到你了, 克洛伊
Oome on, Ohloe.

554
00:35:26,946 --> 00:35:28,213
嗨，亲爱的
Hi, darling.

555
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,913
你看到我的书了吗
Have you seen my Strindberg book?

556
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,313
没有
No.

557
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,147
你的试镜怎么样了
How did your audition go?

558
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:36,480
恐怕非常的糟糕
Oh, it was pretty awful, l'm afraid.

559
00:35:36,547 --> 00:35:39,414
她自己搞砸了，祝福她吧 她正在加强
lt's her own fault, bless her. She just tightens up.

560
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:42,314
我相信事情总会好起来的
Well, l'm sure something worthwhile will come along.

561
00:35:42,414 --> 00:35:46,848
不幸的是 没有其他什么让我感兴趣
Unfortunately, there's just not anything right now that l'm that great for.

562
00:35:48,915 --> 00:35:51,182
那么你还想坚持多久
So, how long do you keep it up?

563
00:35:53,515 --> 00:35:55,082
多久?
How long?

564
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:58,449
如果花了那么多时间 而又没什么收获的话
Well, if time passes and nothing significant materializes,

565
00:35:58,516 --> 00:36:03,050
在你决定去做其他的事前
how long do you keep on going before you decide that...?

566
00:36:03,116 --> 00:36:05,783
你还想坚持多久
to try something else?

567
00:36:06,117 --> 00:36:08,517
我不觉得诺拉到了那个地步，妈妈
l hardly think Nola's reached that point, Mother.

568
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:09,584
我没有说那个
l'm not saying that.

569
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,351
我说的是 你尝试演艺已经有一段时间了
All l'm saying is you give acting a try for a time,

570
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:16,118
如果还是这样没什么成绩 你就得问问自己
and if you keep being disappointed you have to ask yourself the question,

571
00:36:16,184 --> 00:36:20,318
'我到底想要什么，这是我想要的吗'
'ls this really what l want in my life? ls this what l want?'

572
00:36:20,418 --> 00:36:22,685
其实我有问过我自己
Well, l do ask myself that.

573
00:36:22,752 --> 00:36:24,852
听到了吗，逻辑上要这样, 汤姆
See? lt's only logical, tom.

574
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:27,252
尤其是对女性来说
Especially for a woman.

575
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:30,152
对女性来说 这是特别残酷的事情
lt's a particularly cruel business for a woman,

576
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:32,953
当时光流逝，你渐渐变老
and as you get older and time passes,

577
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:35,286
如果年轻时没什么成绩的话 年老时就会变的越来越难
if nothing happens it gets harder and harder.

578
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,853
埃莉诺，诺拉还很年轻
Eleanor, Nola isn't exactly over the hill.

579
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,520
我又不是说现在
l'm not saying now.

580
00:36:42,587 --> 00:36:46,521
我是一个勇于面对现实的人
But l'm a great one for facing up to realities.

581
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:49,621
你接受现实是你自己的观点 与朋人无关
Your take on these realities is your own opinion and nothing else.

582
00:36:49,688 --> 00:36:52,188
坦白说 并不是所有人都愿意听你说这个
Frankly, not everybody else is interested in hearing about it.

583
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:54,421
汤姆, 别这样大声对你妈说话
tom, don't raise your voice to your mother, please.

584
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:56,522
我没有大声说话 对不起，爸爸
l'm not raising my voice. And l'm sorry, Papa,

585
00:36:56,622 --> 00:37:00,555
但这是诺拉自己的事情 不要老是这样
but she's always on Nola's case, continually discouraging her via...

586
00:37:00,622 --> 00:37:01,989
含沙射影
...innuendos.

587
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:04,722
我只是在说演艺很能迷惑人
All l'm saying is acting's so will o' the wisp.

588
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,823
试过的人就知道
those that have it, know it right off.

589
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:09,423
盲目追崇只是不想回到家
to pursue it because you don't want to admit defeat

590
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,357
向朋友承认失败 坦白说，演艺是不切实际的
to friends back home is, frankly, unrealistic.

591
00:37:12,423 --> 00:37:14,423
很遗憾这样说 但我就是这样看问题的
l'm sorry, but that's the way l feel.

592
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,357
失陪了
Excuse me.

593
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,990
诺拉
Nola.

594
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:20,257
没事 我只是想自己静静
lt's Ok. l'd like to be alone, thanks.

595
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:23,258
拜你所赐 如果我大声说话了我表示遗憾
Well, thank you very much. And l'm sorry if l'm raising my voice now,

596
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,525
你明知道那是她的痛点的
but you know that's her Achilles heel, emotionally.

597
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:29,158
他说的对, 埃莉诺 你说的是有点过火了
He's right, Eleanor. l think you've had one too many G and t's.

598
00:38:44,966 --> 00:38:46,466
我正想找你
l was looking for you.

599
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:50,600
我心情不好 想一个人静静
l was upset. l just wanted to be alone.

600
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,667
我无意干扰
l don't mean to intrude.

601
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,834
我想喝酒
l need a drink.

602
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,667
我喜欢你喝酒的样子 有点轻佻
l like you when you drink. You get flirtatious.

603
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:00,734
 是吗 是的
Do l? Yeah.

604
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:03,134
 我非常肯定 我觉得你跟到这来
Oonfident. l don't think this was a good idea.

605
00:39:03,201 --> 00:39:04,835
并不是一个好主意
You shouldn't have followed me here.

606
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:06,901
你觉得心虚吗
Do you feel guilty?

607
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:10,202
你呢
Do you?

608
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:20,169
不能让别人知道
We can't do this.

609
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:22,836
我知道
l know.

610
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:32,004
这不能代表什么
this can't lead anyplace.

611
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:48,878
你好
Hello.

612
00:40:49,978 --> 00:40:51,979
亲爱的，找你的
Darling, l think it's for you.

613
00:40:52,945 --> 00:40:54,812
去外面听
But take it outside.

614
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,447
至少还有希望
Well, there's hope, at least.

615
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:14,714
什么时候会有回复
When's the callback?

616
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:18,948
你有消息就尽快通知我
Just let me know when you hear anything at all,

617
00:41:19,048 --> 00:41:22,248
我真的觉得我很适合这个角色
'cause l really think l could be great in this part.

618
00:41:23,382 --> 00:41:26,115
对，好
Yeah. Ok.

619
00:41:26,182 --> 00:41:27,282
再见
Bye.

620
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:30,049
为什么你对我这么冷漠
Why have you been so cold to me?

621
00:41:30,116 --> 00:41:32,849
 没有啊 不，你有
l haven't been cold. Yes, you have.

622
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:35,083
自从我们从乡下别墅回来以后
Ever since we came back from the countryside

623
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,550
你就在疏远我，逃避我
you've been distant, evasive.

624
00:41:37,616 --> 00:41:39,750
我不想助长什么
l don't want to encourage anything.

625
00:41:39,817 --> 00:41:42,150
过去的已经过去了, 克里斯
What happened, happened, Ohris.

626
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:45,184
当时大家都不理智
l mean... the moment was very out of control for many reasons.

627
00:41:45,251 --> 00:41:47,951
我心烦意乱，风雨又大
l was upset, l was drinking, and the storm was overpowering.

628
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:50,718
 哦，别找借口了 我没找借口
Oh, stop rationalizing. l'm not rationalizing.

629
00:41:50,784 --> 00:41:54,852
那只是一时冲动 我们都有自己的伴侣
Passions are passions, but we're both very involved with other people.

630
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:58,219
你别演戏了 不可能的
You're not such a good actress, you know. lt's not possible.

631
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:01,952
你老是在想我们做爱的事
Look, you daydreamed about making love to me,

632
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,819
我并不是说我没有想过
and l'm not saying the fantasy didn't cross my mind, Ok?

633
00:42:04,886 --> 00:42:06,186
我们是待过
We had our moment.

634
00:42:06,253 --> 00:42:08,753
但，生活还得继续 我们回到现实中来吧
But, you know, let's move on, get back to reality.

635
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,086
克里斯 我快要成为你的嫂子了
Ohris, we're gonna be brother and sister in law.

636
00:42:11,587 --> 00:42:14,120
你口是心非
You were exactly as l pictured you'd be making love.

637
00:42:14,187 --> 00:42:16,420
克里斯, 忘了吧 结束了
Ohris, forget it. lt's over.

638
00:42:29,522 --> 00:42:32,055
谢谢 亨利
thanks. Henry!

639
00:42:32,155 --> 00:42:34,789
 嗨，你好吗 克里斯，还好
Hey. How are you? Ohris. All right.

640
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:36,389
 看看你 见到你真高兴
Look at you. Good to see you.

641
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:38,756
混的还不错嘛
Looks like you're doing all right for yourself, aren't you?

642
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:40,556
 谢谢 你还在打巡回赛吗
thanks. You still doing the tennis tour?

643
00:42:40,623 --> 00:42:42,356
是啊, 乐此不疲 看看这车
Yeah, l love it. l love it. Look at this car.

644
00:42:42,423 --> 00:42:44,790
不是我的 公司的车
Oh, don't worry, it's not mine. lt's the company's.

645
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:47,457
我知道你已经转行了
Yeah, l know you found it a bit of a grind, didn't you?

646
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,257
而我还在为比赛全球奔波
But l'm still circling the globe, deluding myself.

647
00:42:50,324 --> 00:42:52,057
我受不了那样
l just couldn't stand it.

648
00:42:52,124 --> 00:42:54,457
是啊 我听说你做起了生意
No. No, l heard you went into business.

649
00:42:54,524 --> 00:42:56,758
只是办公室里跑腿的轮子而已 如果你信的话
l'm a wheel in an office, if you can believe it.

650
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,258
 那也是只大轮子啊 原来你知道啊, 亨利
A big wheel. lt's who you know, Henry.

651
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:01,858
我攀上了一个女孩 人还不错
l got involved with a woman. very nice.

652
00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:03,525
家里很有钱
Family's got nothing but money.

653
00:43:03,592 --> 00:43:06,792
不动产，仆人，马球场 挺吸引人的
Big estate, servants, polo ponies. All quite lovely.

654
00:43:06,892 --> 00:43:07,925
看的出来
Hey, look, l understand.

655
00:43:08,025 --> 00:43:10,692
种子选手给你带来的心灵创伤 还没有消失殆尽啊
lt beats getting your heart broken all the time by the top seeds.

656
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:13,293
生活就像网球那样
lsn't it amazing how much of life turns on whether the ball

657
00:43:13,393 --> 00:43:14,860
要么过网，要么弹回来 不是很神奇的事吗

我跟你也只不过半斤八两
l lost to you as much as l beat you.

663
00:43:23,827 --> 00:43:25,627
不，你和我打的时候 只是输给了自己
No. When l played you, you never beat yourself.

664
00:43:25,694 --> 00:43:27,694
我跟你说吧 如果你没改行
l'm telling you, a couple of bounces the other way,

665

你可能已经打败一些种子选手了

 她还戴了眼镜 为什么
She's got glasses on. But why on earth...?

679
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:56,597
为什么你妈要请她来这里
Why on earth would your mother invite her here?

680
00:43:56,664 --> 00:43:59,197
她昨天在超级市场遇见她 就邀请她了

You've been like two peas in a pod for a long time now.

00:44:16,632 --> 00:44:18,933
埃莉诺喝多了就有一些神经质
Eleanor doesn't hold back when she's had a few.

691
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:22,066
其实也没什么 克洛伊和我也商量过了
Look, it's a reasonable question. Ohloe and l have discussed it.

不好意思，别介意
l'm sorry. Who'd have thought?

699
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:21,039
至于我们躲在这里
What, that we were hiding in the pantry?

700
00:45:21,105 --> 00:45:22,472
都是她的鬼主意
lt was all her fault, you know.

701
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:25,306
她性欲来了我还能怎么办
Like, how can l help it if she gets turned on by sexual intimacy

702
00:45:25,373 --> 00:45:27,373
我们也没有想到这里会被发现
in places that we know we're gonna get caught?

703
00:45:27,439 --> 00:45:29,873
说谎 这个危险的游戏可是你的主意
You were... You! the risky business was your idea.

723
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,580

这和我跟不跟奥利维亚结婚

Although the fact that my mother is in seventh heaven about her,

852
00:56:11,471 --> 00:56:14,571
现在才找到 不好意思
We can't find it at all. Will you excuse us?

853
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,971
我想在三楼，是吗

861
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,007
再见
Bye.

862
00:56:45,607 --> 00:56:47,574
我想他医术不错
l think he really knows what he's doing.

863
00:56:47,674 --> 00:56:49,608
你对他没好感吗
Didn't you get a good feeling about him?

864
00:56:49,674 --> 00:56:52,341
对我来说 妇科医生只比巫医好一点
to me, fertility doctors are a cut above witch doctors.

865
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,541
他和上次那个不一样
Oh, yeah. Well, he's not like that last one.

866
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:55,908
不用了，约翰
lt's Ok, John.

867
00:56:55,975 --> 00:56:57,775
我觉得这次会怀上的
l feel like it's gonna happen this time.

868
00:56:57,842 --> 00:56:59,609
你先回去 我得去开会
You go ahead, l've got a few meetings.

869
00:56:59,675 --> 00:57:02,209
 我送你吧 不用了，就在这附近，走过去就行了
l'll drop you. No, it's Ok. lt's nearby. l'll walk.

870
00:57:02,276 --> 00:57:03,442
 好吧 家里见

871
00:57:03,509 --> 00:57:04,509
再见
Bye.

872
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,113
你的公寓很不错啊
You have a very charming flat.

873
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:42,980
并没有像你上次说的那样被拆掉
the area's not as run down as you said it was.

874
00:57:45,147 --> 00:57:47,880
运气不错 短时间内找到这样的房子
l was lucky to find it on such short notice.

875
00:57:49,247 --> 00:57:50,680
只是觉得不够完美
l mean, it's not perfect.

876
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:53,714
这房子被盗好多次了
the building's been burglarized a couple of times and the...

877
00:57:53,781 --> 00:57:55,914
住那边的那个女的家里犯鼠害
...woman down the hall has mice, but...

878
00:57:56,781 --> 00:57:59,781
但大堂还是可以的
...you know, the lobby's decent.

879
00:58:00,448 --> 00:58:02,815
关键是它便宜
the key word is it's cheap.

880
00:58:04,115 --> 00:58:05,682
几点了
What time is it?

881
00:58:06,315 --> 00:58:07,915
你该回去了
time for you to go.

882
00:58:09,482 --> 00:58:11,483
真舍不得离开你
lt's so hard to leave you.

883
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,750
迷人的尤物
Beautiful woman.

884
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,450
睡得好吗
How'd you sleep?

885
00:58:25,617 --> 00:58:26,984
不错
Good.

886
00:58:30,418 --> 00:58:32,818
你昨晚有看新闻吗
God, did you see that stuff on the news last night

887
00:58:32,918 --> 00:58:34,885
关于中国的地震
about that earthquake in Ohina?

888
00:58:36,852 --> 00:58:38,485
惨不忍睹
terrible.

889
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:42,586
还有他们说的没完没了的
And there was this whole thing about how they've discovered

890
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:45,586
 发现新行星的事 是吗
an entirely new planet. Yeah?

891
00:58:45,653 --> 00:58:47,086
嗯
Yeah.

892
00:58:59,721 --> 00:59:02,821
昨天我去了找合适新画廊的地方
l went looking for space to rent for the new gallery yesterday.

893
00:59:02,888 --> 00:59:05,255
爸爸在这方面很支持
Papa's getting so into the idea.

894
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:07,521
相信对你有好处
lt should be good for you.

895
00:59:09,422 --> 00:59:11,889
 我得去上班了 是吗
l've got to go to work. Oh, really?

896
00:59:13,422 --> 00:59:16,189
我在想我们是不是可以 你知道的
l was kind of hoping we might, you know...

897
00:59:16,256 --> 00:59:18,223
在你上班之前
...before you went to work.

898
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:21,390
现在是排卵期 而且医生说了
lt's my time of the month, and remember the doctor said

899
00:59:21,456 --> 00:59:24,923
我们要尽可能的在早上多做做
we really should try and do it as often as we possibly can in the morning.

900
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:29,924
 亲爱的，我会迟到的 别这样，会很有意思的
Darling, l'm gonna be late. Oome on, it'll be fun.

901
00:59:30,324 --> 00:59:32,624
等等，我要先量一下的体温
Wait, l've got to take my temperature first.

902
00:59:45,459 --> 00:59:47,959
你想下周同一时间见面吗
So, you wanna meet the same time next week?

903
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:49,492
让我上去吧
Let me come up.

904
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:52,426
我们刚在旅馆消魂了一个多小时 不要告诉我你现在又...
We just spent an hour at the hotel. Don't tell me that you...

905
00:59:52,493 --> 00:59:54,893
对不起，我情不自禁 你让我疯狂
l'm sorry. l can't help it. You drive me crazy.

906
00:59:57,793 --> 01:00:00,027
 你上班要迟到了 我才不管
You're gonna be late for work. l don't care.

907
01:00:03,094 --> 01:00:04,594
快点
Oome on.

908
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:12,061
 哦，艾斯比太太，你好 你好
Oh, Mrs. Eastby, hello. Oh, hello.

909
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:14,528
你的鼠害得到控制了吗
Hey, did you get that pest control...?

910
01:00:14,595 --> 01:00:15,762
哦，当然
Oh, yes. Yes.

911
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,295
用一点花生酱就搞定了
the traps work better with a little peanut butter.

912
01:00:18,362 --> 01:00:19,829
它比干酪好多了
lt's much better than cheese,

913
01:00:19,895 --> 01:00:22,229
虽然大家都认为干酪是最好的
despite the popular notion that cheese is best.

914
01:00:22,296 --> 01:00:24,696
 这是哈里斯先生 下午好，你好
Oh, this is Mr. Harris. Good afternoon. How are you?

915
01:00:24,763 --> 01:00:26,263

917

再见
Bye.

918
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:03,900
我认为画廊座落在布鲁顿街的话 会很完美
But l think that Bruton Street would be perfect for the gallery

919
01:01:03,966 --> 01:01:06,033
因为那里是商贸中心
because it's just right in the thick of things and...

920
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,567
人多的话效果自然好点
lt'll just be a natural success, l think,

921
01:01:07,633 --> 01:01:10,000
而且你善于挑选油画和捣弄小古董
because you're great at picking out paintings and bric a brac.

922
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:11,334
是啊
Yeah.

923
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:14,001
希望开张的时候 我就可以怀上BB
knowing my luck, l'll get pregnant the minute it opens.

924
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:16,001
当然，你可以两者兼得的 我是说
Yeah, well, you can manage both. l mean...

925
01:01:16,068 --> 01:01:17,434
黑德丝怀上罗丝的时候
Heths didn't have a problem

926
01:01:17,501 --> 01:01:19,435
也没有什么问题
giving up Adair, when we first had Rosie.

927
01:01:19,501 --> 01:01:21,468
当然，有很多人帮我们
Remember, we did have a lot of help though.

928
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,735
但是保姆后来走了 她在一部电影里找了个角色
But the nanny left us. She got a part in a movie.

929
01:01:23,835 --> 01:01:24,969
 不是吧 是的
No. Yeah.

930
01:01:25,069 --> 01:01:27,735
你们知道我前几天碰见谁了吗
Actually, you know who we bumped into the other day?

931
01:01:28,169 --> 01:01:30,736
你显然知道, 是诺拉
Obviously you know, but... Nola. Yeah.

932
01:01:30,836 --> 01:01:33,469
我跟你说，我们也碰见过她 什么时候来着，就不久前
Well, l told you, we saw her. When was it? Ages ago now.

933
01:01:33,536 --> 01:01:37,236
她现在在拉伯瑞街的一家专卖店上班
Yeah. Well, l think she's now working in a boutique on Ledbury Road.

934
01:01:37,303 --> 01:01:39,403
我想那是保罗和乔的店
l think it's Paul and Joe's or something.

935
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,837
她居然还是单身
But she's just such an odd girl.

936
01:01:41,904 --> 01:01:44,771
她看上去还是那么漂亮 抱歉，但事实是那样
l mean, she still looks great. Sorry, but it's true.

937
01:01:45,637 --> 01:01:47,637
但有些只是...
But something's just...

938
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,404
感觉她和以前有些不一样 我只和她聊了两句
...changed in her face. l mean, l... We barely spoke.

939
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:52,005
汤姆说她看起来很辛苦的样子
tom said she looked a bit hard.

940
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:55,238
对的，她看上去 有点像做沙司的女人
Yeah, well, she's always, you know, been a lady of the sauce, so to speak.

941
01:01:55,305 --> 01:01:57,072
但我认为这一点是世代相传的
And l think it kind of runs in the family,

942
01:01:57,138 --> 01:01:59,272
怎么说呢
but, l don't know...

943
01:02:00,072 --> 01:02:02,639
她看上去还是那么迷人
l mean she's still got that 'come hither' look.

944
01:02:03,439 --> 01:02:06,806
 她有男朋友吗 奇怪的是，我居然忘了问这个
ls she going out with anyone? Strangely, l forgot to ask.

945
01:02:06,873 --> 01:02:08,906
我知道一定会告诉你的 卡洛伊
But l'll keep you in touch with that, Ohloe, let you know.

946
01:02:09,006 --> 01:02:10,273
 你好, 汤姆 你好
Hello, tom. Hello.

947
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:13,173
 你怎么会在这里
Hello, fella. What are you doing here?

948
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,074
我们才过来不久 听说这里的意大利面很地道
We just popped in for a bit of, you know, local tagliatelle.

949
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:18,274
见到你太好了 多么温馨的家庭聚会啊
Good to see you. What a lovely family gathering.

950
01:02:18,341 --> 01:02:19,674
你应该告诉我的 我们就可以来个六人组合了
You should have told us. We'd have made a sextet.

951
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:20,741
六人组合？ 下次就来个六人组合吧
A sextet. We could have had one of those.

952
01:02:20,807 --> 01:02:22,874
 你们下个月去海力？ 是啊，有此打算
You guys going to Hedley next month? Yeah, we're gonna try. Aren't we?

953
01:02:22,941 --> 01:02:24,274
我知道汤姆很不想去
l know tom's dying to get away.

954
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:25,941
有一天我看见你了 叫你你没有听见
l was yelling at you the other day. You didn't hear me.

955
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,008
我?
Me?

956
01:02:27,075 --> 01:02:30,175
是啊，你正在米堪宝街截计程车 5点的样子
Yeah, you were hailing a cab on Melcombe Street about, what, 5:00.

957
01:02:30,242 --> 01:02:33,309
 本想搭你一程的 有吗
l'd have given you a lift. l was?

958
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,142
 米堪宝街在哪 不，不是我
Where's Melcombe Street? No, not me.

959
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:37,409
是你 我是说看上去和你一模一样
Yes, l mean it certainly looked like you.

960
01:02:37,509 --> 01:02:40,509
 米堪宝街在哪 不可能，我想你认错了
Where is Melcombe Street? No, l'm afraid you're mistaken.

961
01:02:40,609 --> 01:02:43,010
认错人的事多如牛毛
But people are always taking me for other people. So...

962
01:02:43,076 --> 01:02:44,176
我发誓就是你
l'd have sworn it was you.

963
01:02:44,276 --> 01:02:46,443
克里斯不可能截计程车的
Well, it certainly wouldn't be Ohris hailing a cab.

964
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,377
他到哪都和司机一起的
He's completely dependant on our driver.

965
01:02:48,444 --> 01:02:49,710
 没错 不可能的
Quite right. very annoying.

966
01:02:49,777 --> 01:02:53,544
你好好想想，你可能是忘记了 我肯定我没有认错人
You should check for early Alzheimer's. You're forgetting. l'm sure l'm right.

967
01:02:53,611 --> 01:02:56,778
不, 你搞错了 不过还是谢谢你
No, you are mistaken. But thank you for thinking of me.

968
01:02:56,844 --> 01:03:00,378
我觉得你们不是在胡扯
l think the only thing that comes out of this conversation is you're both nuts.

969
01:03:00,445 --> 01:03:03,645
 你知道我不会 就是喝多了，怎么可能
Well, you're an authority on that. Or drunk. How dare you?

970
01:03:03,712 --> 01:03:05,079
我们得走了 打给我
Look, we'd better be going on. Look, call me.

971
01:03:05,145 --> 01:03:06,512
 没问题 享受你的晚餐吧
l will do. Enjoy your supper.

972
01:03:06,579 --> 01:03:07,712
 再见，后会有期 谢谢
Bye. See you. thanks.

973
01:03:07,779 --> 01:03:08,779
疯子
Nuts.

974
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,479
下午好，玛丽亚
Good afternoon, lngrid.

975
01:03:12,213 --> 01:03:14,413
萨曼塔, 下午有什么安排
Samantha, what do we have for this afternoon?

976
01:03:14,513 --> 01:03:16,680
两点钟会见萨拉族人
Just the Sarazin people at two.

977
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,880
 可以推迟一个小时吗 好的
Oan we push it an hour? Yeah.

978
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:21,213
我应该能赶回来，没有的话 好好招待他们
l should be back in time, but if l'm not, please make them comfortable.

979
01:03:25,281 --> 01:03:26,947
克里斯，你去哪
Ohris. Where are you off to?

980
01:03:27,014 --> 01:03:29,081
抱歉, 罗德 我得去应个约
l'm sorry, Rod, l've got an appointment.

981
01:03:29,148 --> 01:03:31,348
下午要会见萨拉族人
We have Sarazin and company this afternoon.

982
01:03:31,415 --> 01:03:34,315
我应该能赶回来，没有的话 不用等我
l should be back in time but if l'm not, please start without me.

983
01:03:34,448 --> 01:03:38,282
 是吗 没问题的，我有急事，真的
Really? lt's Ok. lt's important, trust me.

984
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:41,115
到我那去有点可笑
lt's ridiculous to go back to my place.

985
01:03:41,182 --> 01:03:43,049
每次你去 都待不到一小时
Once we get there, you'll have less than an hour.

986
01:03:43,116 --> 01:03:45,583
听着，并不是说和克洛伊一起不痛苦 只是
Look, it's not that l'm miserable with Ohloe, it's just...

987
01:03:45,649 --> 01:03:47,149
我不想再谈论克洛伊
l don't wanna talk about Ohloe anymore!

988
01:03:47,216 --> 01:03:49,350
我只是感到无聊 她人还是不坏的
Listen, it's just l'm bored! l mean, she's very nice, but...

989
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:51,316
 克里斯 你心情不好吗
Ohris! Are you in a bad mood?

990
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:53,783
是的，我心情不好 我刚把一个试镜搞砸了
Yes, l am in a bad mood. l just blew another audition.

991
01:03:53,883 --> 01:03:56,250
我厌倦了表演 永远都没有出路
l'm so sick of this acting thing, it's just not working out.

992
01:03:56,317 --> 01:03:57,350
做演员并不容易
lt's a hard field.

993
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:59,917
 你得不停的努力 我讨厌不停的试
You have to keep plugging at it. l'm sick of plugging.

994
01:04:00,017 --> 01:04:02,851
汤姆的妈妈是对的 她说的一点都没错
tom's mother was right. ltjust gets to a point, you know?

995
01:04:02,918 --> 01:04:04,685
也许我该称呼她为你岳母
Or should l say your mother in law?

996
01:04:04,751 --> 01:04:07,751
我们不要说这些了好吗
Hey, look. Let's not go into one of those, Ok?

997
01:04:08,918 --> 01:04:12,852
我不知道和你在一起为了什么 你从没想过要离开克洛伊
l don't know what l'm doing with you. You're never gonna leave Ohloe.

998
01:04:14,552 --> 01:04:16,586
也许我会的
Maybe l will.

999
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:21,053
不要空口说白话
Don't say that unless you mean it.

1000
01:04:22,553 --> 01:04:25,153
克洛伊只是发了疯的想怀上孩子
Ohloe's just so desperate to get pregnant.

1001
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,287
我们已没有激情可言
l mean, it's... mechanical.

1002
01:04:32,487 --> 01:04:34,654
没有你 我不知道我会怎样
l don't know what l'd do if l couldn't see you.

1003
01:04:36,621 --> 01:04:39,021
我是认真的
Really. l mean it.

1004
01:04:41,855 --> 01:04:44,522
 圣诞快乐 调皮鬼
Merry bloody Ohristmas. Lovely.

1005
01:04:44,588 --> 01:04:46,289
你今天想抽几根烟
How many cigarettes are you gonna smoke today?

1006
01:04:46,355 --> 01:04:48,556
 一百万, 至少 不要学抽烟
A million, at least. Please don't start smoking.

1007
01:04:48,622 --> 01:04:50,489
 随他吧，今天是圣诞节 对身体不好
Well, it is Ohristmas. lt's such a pity.

1008
01:04:50,556 --> 01:04:51,723
 别这样，只抽几支 你会变得...
Oome on, just a little one. lt's gonna...

1009
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:54,256
你觉得没什么 其实不尽然
You think you're going to be living forever, you're not.

1010
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:55,956
嗨
Hi.

1011
01:04:56,023 --> 01:04:58,357
祝你圣诞快乐
l wanted to wish you a merry Ohristmas.

1012
01:04:59,523 --> 01:05:01,957
我一直在想你
l've been thinking about you.

1013
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:07,691
我明天可以离开一个小时左右
l may be able to get away tomorrow, for an hour or so.

1014
01:05:09,191 --> 01:05:11,625
好的，到时见
Ok. See you then.

1015
01:05:11,691 --> 01:05:13,225
再见
Bye bye.

1016
01:05:13,925 --> 01:05:15,825
你在这啊, 克里斯
there you are, Ohris.

1017
01:05:15,892 --> 01:05:19,259
克洛伊跟我说过去几个月
Ohloe tells me you've sustained some personal loss in the market

1018
01:05:19,325 --> 01:05:21,092
你在市场规划上犯了些错误
over the past few months.

1019
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:24,092
我想我有点粗心了 精力 不够集中
Well, l guess l've been a little bit careless, not concentrating.

1020
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:25,959
我认为我做了好的决定 没想到...
And, of course, l thought l made good decisions, but...

1021
01:05:26,026 --> 01:05:27,859
谁都想不到会这样
Well, who could have predicted these...?

1022
01:05:27,926 --> 01:05:30,193
我不想你和克洛伊担心什么
Look, l don't want you and Ohloe to worry.

1023
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,127
 我们会照看你的 你太好了，先生
You'll always have a safety net. You're too generous, sir.

1024
01:05:33,193 --> 01:05:34,727
你让克洛伊快乐
Oh, no, you've made Ohloe happy,

1025
01:05:34,794 --> 01:05:36,860
就是对我和埃莉诺最好的报答了
and that means a great deal to Eleanor and me.

1026
01:06:38,033 --> 01:06:42,000
我想这会是个令人向往的假期 是吗, 克里斯
Well, l think it's gonna be an amazing holiday. Don't you, Ohris?

1027
01:06:42,067 --> 01:06:43,434
当然
Yes.

1028
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,201
我们可以选择在船上或者旅馆过夜
We have a choice of sleeping on the boat or in the different hotels.

1029
01:06:47,267 --> 01:06:48,268
 船上 船上
Boat. Boat.

1030
01:06:48,334 --> 01:06:49,534
 每晚都是 好极了，我也选船上
Every time. Good. l say the boat.

1031
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:50,968
他从来没有去过希腊岛
Do you know he's never been to the Greek lslands.

1032
01:06:51,034 --> 01:06:52,268
 什么 不是吧
What? No.

1033
01:06:52,335 --> 01:06:53,868
是的, 他从没去过
No, he's never been. You'll love it.

1034
01:06:53,935 --> 01:06:56,802
是的，我去过雅典 我听说那个岛简直就是个天堂
No. l have been to Athens, but l hear the lslands are paradise.

1035
01:06:56,868 --> 01:06:57,868
我想起来了
Oh, that reminds me,

1036
01:06:57,968 --> 01:07:00,435
我们可以去温斯顿和布鲁克的撒丁岛
we have to go to Sardinia to pop in on Brook and Dougie Winston.

1037
01:07:00,502 --> 01:07:01,469
 不是吧 天哪
Oh, good. Oh, God.

1038
01:07:01,569 --> 01:07:04,069
 那里房子很漂亮 布鲁克还行，温斯顿就免了吧
No, no, the house is beautiful. Brook's fine, Dougie's a nightmare.

1039
01:07:04,169 --> 01:07:06,003
听起来很浪漫 克利特岛
Sounds so romantic, doesn't it? Mkonos and Orete.

1040
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:07,036
 是啊 是的
Yeah. Yeah.

1041
01:07:07,136 --> 01:07:09,670
我很想快点见到 美丽古老的寺庙和剧院
l'm so anxious to see all the beautiful old temples and theaters.

1042
01:07:09,736 --> 01:07:10,736
天哪
Oh, God.

1043
01:07:10,803 --> 01:07:12,237
是啊 我可以和你一起去
Yeah. Oh, l'll do that with you. tom can stay...

1044
01:07:12,303 --> 01:07:15,270
我给克里斯买了 一个古老的希腊生育符咒
You know, l bought Ohris an ancient Greek fertility charm.

1045
01:07:15,337 --> 01:07:17,204
 你还记得吗 永远也忘不了
Do you remember? l'll never forget.

1046
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:18,971
我邮寄给他
l sent off for that fertility thingy.

1047
01:07:19,037 --> 01:07:21,971
叫他放在枕头下两个月
He had to put it under his pillow for two months.

1048
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,038
当然什么也没发生
And absolutely nothing happened, of course.

1049
01:07:25,105 --> 01:07:26,105
太可惜了
Poor thing.

1050
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:28,772
我把他整惨了 有人说他是个空枪王子
l'd just subjected him to the torture. they think he's firing blanks.

1051
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:29,838
喂
Oh, shut up! Hello?

1052
01:07:29,905 --> 01:07:31,605
我想见你
l miss you.

1053
01:07:32,139 --> 01:07:34,405
 笑一个，笑一个 不，一点都不好笑
Love me. Just love me. No, because it's not funny.

1054
01:07:34,505 --> 01:07:35,972
对不起
lt's not funny. l'm sorry.

1055
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:38,173
我没法以身试之 所以言之不可信
Proof is in the pudding, and there ain't been any pudding.

1056
01:07:38,273 --> 01:07:40,306
 我现在走不开 我不管
l can't get away right now. Well, you have to.

1057
01:07:40,406 --> 01:07:42,040
你什么时候能来
When can you get here?

1058
01:07:43,206 --> 01:07:45,440
明天，不 星期一
tomorrow. No, Monday.

1059
01:07:45,507 --> 01:07:46,873
听着
Look...

1060
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:49,274
现在是三天假期的周末
lt's a three day weekend.

1061
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,107
星期二吧
tuesday.

1062
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:53,641
克里斯 我现在就得见到你
Ohris, l need to see you.

1063
01:07:54,808 --> 01:07:57,508
我看看能不能离开 待会再打给你
l'll see what l can do. l'll call you right back.

1064
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,008
能见到芭芭拉·史翠珊太好了
l would love to meet Barbra Streisand.

1065
01:08:00,075 --> 01:08:03,042
她很友善 她和其他美国朋友一起来的
She's meant to be really lovely. She's with that other American fella.

1066
01:08:03,108 --> 01:08:04,675
 是谁啊 我真是个笨蛋
Who was that? Oh, l'm such an idiot.

1067
01:08:04,742 --> 01:08:07,142
我忘记签一些文件了 可能要去城里一趟
l forgot to sign some papers. l may have to drive into town.

1068
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:08,209
杰克·加纳
Jack Garner?

1069
01:08:08,276 --> 01:08:10,309
你不能去 银行都休假了
You can't go, it's a bank holiday weekend.

1070
01:08:10,376 --> 01:08:11,676
交通很烂的
the traffic'll be terrible.

1071
01:08:11,776 --> 01:08:14,176
我们都计划好了的
James Garner, that's it. l mean, we've all got plans.

1072
01:08:14,243 --> 01:08:15,210
不一定今天去
l don't mean today.

1073
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:16,943
他们给自己的狗起名伊莲·佩姬
they named their little dog after Elaine Paige.

1074
01:08:17,043 --> 01:08:18,377
过几天再签肯定也没问题
Well, surely it can wait a couple of days.

1075
01:08:18,443 --> 01:08:20,277
他们为什么这么做？ 因为它晚上一直叫唤
Why did they do that? 'Oause it howls all night long.

1076
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:21,844
我也这么觉得
Yes, l'm sure it can. Oh, that's mean.

1077
01:08:21,944 --> 01:08:23,710
同感，那是只很小的毛茸茸的狗
l know. And it's terribly small and furry.

1078
01:08:23,777 --> 01:08:24,777
太恶劣了
that's mean.

1079
01:08:25,344 --> 01:08:27,877
我想明天早上我们可以去骑骑马
l think tomorrow we should go for a morning ride.

1080
01:08:27,944 --> 01:08:29,411
我买了几匹新马
l've some lovely new horses.

1081
01:08:29,478 --> 01:08:31,078
你还记得克里斯第一次来这吗
Do you remember when Ohris came here first,

1082
01:08:31,144 --> 01:08:33,111
他不敢骑马
and he had some serious qualms about riding?

1083
01:08:33,178 --> 01:08:34,278
我跟泰德谈过 他怎么样？
l spoke to teddy. How is he?

1084
01:08:34,345 --> 01:08:36,178
今天上午他还在说想给自己买匹马呢
Well, this morning he was talking about buying a horse of his own.

1085
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:37,845
 不是吧 真的
No. Yeah.

1086
01:08:37,912 --> 01:08:39,445
我不知道，这很有趣
l don't know, it was all in good fun.

1087
01:08:39,512 --> 01:08:40,645
从哪里买？ 随便...
Where from? Anyway...

1088
01:08:40,712 --> 01:08:43,112
南希有一匹很漂亮的马
l think Nan's got a really nice mare. ...he's a wonderful new horse.

1089
01:08:43,179 --> 01:08:46,013
你的电话，先生 她说有急事
telephone call, sir. She said it was important.

1090
01:08:49,113 --> 01:08:50,580
失陪一下
Excuse me.

1091
01:08:51,947 --> 01:08:53,913
 明天上午吗 你来不来
tomorrow morning? Do you wanna come?

1092
01:08:54,013 --> 01:08:56,714
该死的电话 整个周末就没有停过
that bloody phone has not stopped ringing all weekend.

1093
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,781
 没错 太烦人了
l know. lt's so irritating.

1094
01:08:59,247 --> 01:09:00,214
喂
Hello?

1095
01:09:00,314 --> 01:09:02,514
我打过你手机 但你关机了
l tried to call your mobile, but it's off.

1096
01:09:02,981 --> 01:09:04,948
你疯了? 打到这里来
Are you mad calling me here?

1097
01:09:05,548 --> 01:09:07,181
你什么时候过来
When are you coming over?

1098
01:09:07,248 --> 01:09:09,248
我尽量明天过去
l'm trying to make it for tomorrow.

1099
01:09:09,315 --> 01:09:11,415
我等不到明天了 我快要疯了
l can't wait till tomorrow, l'm going crazy.

1100
01:09:11,482 --> 01:09:14,315
 到底是什么事 我怀孕了
What the hell's the matter? l'm pregnant.

1101
01:09:20,483 --> 01:09:22,483
我明天过去
l'll talk to you tomorrow.

1102
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:25,017
我们要去试骑
'Oause we've got to go and try and look at this...

1103
01:09:25,117 --> 01:09:28,184
为克里斯选马 他们是从海军部门买来的
...horse for Ohris. they got it in the navy?

1104
01:09:28,984 --> 01:09:31,917
它缺乏蔬菜喂养
Yeah, the... lt was lack of enough vegetables, or something.

1105
01:09:31,984 --> 01:09:34,484
我想这也许是他们 采购柠檬和橘子的原因
l wonder if that's why they took lemons and oranges...

1106
01:09:34,584 --> 01:09:35,918
他们只有饼干
Well, they only had biscuits.

1107
01:09:35,984 --> 01:09:38,351
柠檬汁就是这样发明的
Well, that's where Rose's Lime Oordial originated...

1108
01:09:38,418 --> 01:09:42,185
 谁打来的 萨曼塔, 我秘书
Who keeps calling? lt was Samantha, my secretary.

1109
01:09:42,252 --> 01:09:45,385
恐怕明天我不能骑马了 有些事要处理
l'm afraid l won't be able to go riding tomorrow. l can't help it.

1110
01:09:45,452 --> 01:09:47,719
萨曼塔不是说她这个周末 去看他父母的吗
l thought Samantha said she was going to her parents this weekend.

1111
01:09:47,785 --> 01:09:50,052
我知道，我把留下来工作了 可怜的孩子
l know, it's all my fault. Poor girl.

1112
01:09:50,952 --> 01:09:52,286
没什么大不了的
lt's no big deal.

1113
01:09:52,353 --> 01:09:53,519
我赶去城里
l'll pop back into town.

1114
01:09:53,653 --> 01:09:57,620
几个小时就可以搞定 不会再让它烦我了，我保证
the whole thing'll take a few hours, and it'll be off my mind. l promise.

1115
01:09:57,686 --> 01:09:59,353
 真可惜 真不爽
that's a shame. lt's really sad.

1116
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:01,053
太可怜了，因为
Well, it is a pity because l...

1117
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,320
我也认为对萨曼塔是不公平的 坦白说
l think it's unfair on Samantha too, frankly.

1118
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,754
是不应该
Yeah. Well, it's unfortunate,

1119
01:10:04,854 --> 01:10:06,954
但是 克里斯有太多事要处理了
but, you know, Chris has a lot of responsibility.

1120
01:10:07,054 --> 01:10:08,688
我们别说这个了
Well, anyway, let's not worry about it. Let's...

1121
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:10,254
你这奴隶主 自从有人类文明以来
Slave driver. Look, as long as we make lamb bone.

1122
01:10:10,354 --> 01:10:11,321
你能... 行了，我认输
Oan you, can you...? Well, l think so.

1123
01:10:11,488 --> 01:10:14,188
 怎么可能会怀上的 我跟你说了上个月的那个周末
How the hell did you get pregnant? l told you that weekend last month

1124
01:10:14,255 --> 01:10:16,055
我们要小心点 我没有做保护措施
that we needed to be careful and l didn't have protection,

1125
01:10:16,122 --> 01:10:17,688
但你不肯等
but you couldn't wait.

1126
01:10:19,589 --> 01:10:21,489
难以置信的背
What unbelievable bad luck.

1127
01:10:21,556 --> 01:10:24,356
天啊, 无论我怎么努力 都不能让我老婆怀孕
Ohrist, l can't get my wife pregnant no matter how hard l try,

1128
01:10:24,422 --> 01:10:26,256
而你没防范一会儿 我就中招了
and the minute you're unprotected l knock you up.

1129
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:28,123
因为你爱我 不爱她
lt's 'cause you love me, and you don't love her.

1130
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,223
那是你的理由吗
ls that your interpretation?

1131
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:31,357
孩子是真正爱情的结晶
lt's a child conceived out of genuine passion,

1132
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:34,023
而不是例行公事那样得来的
not as part of some fertility project.

1133
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:35,990
好吧 我陪你去打掉它
Ok. Well l'll go with you, and we'll get it sorted.

1134
01:10:36,057 --> 01:10:37,824
 我不能再那样做了 再?
l'm not doing that again. Again?

1135
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:40,457
 那是什么意思 这是第三次了
What's that supposed to mean? lt's the third time.

1136
01:10:40,557 --> 01:10:43,058
我年轻的时候做过一次 又为汤姆堕了一次
l did it once when l was younger, and then l did it for tom.

1137
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:44,958
我不想打掉的 但他非要
l didn't want to, but he insisted.

1138
01:10:45,025 --> 01:10:46,991
诺拉 我想不出还有什么办法
Nola, l really can't see any other way.

1139
01:10:47,058 --> 01:10:49,025
 为什么不能生下来 怎么养
Why can't l just have it? And what?

1140
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:52,059
 我们可以一起带大他 那是绝对不可能的
And we'll raise it together. that's obviously not possible.

1141
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:54,092
为什么，你讨厌你的工作 你讨厌你的生活
Why? You hate yourjob, you hate your life.

1142
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,859
我是说我们可以一起生活 孩子就是个祝福
l mean, it seems like a blessing. lt's a sign.

1143
01:10:56,926 --> 01:10:58,626
诺拉, 我得走了
Look, Nola, l have to go.

1144
01:10:58,693 --> 01:11:00,659
我编了六个谎言才能来这
l'm juggling six things at the same time

1145
01:11:00,726 --> 01:11:03,293
我得让事情看上去我没有骗人
just to make this trip to the city look legit.

1146
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,260
我们星期二再谈
l'll talk to you on tuesday.

1147
01:11:06,327 --> 01:11:07,560
克里斯
Ohris...

1148
01:11:07,627 --> 01:11:10,760
你一定要... 我希望你可以快点解决这个
You must... l expect you to do the right thing, Ok?

1149
01:11:10,827 --> 01:11:13,361
我是不会罢休的
l'm not walking away from this.

1150
01:11:14,994 --> 01:11:17,995
是不是有什么事啊 整个周末都见你不开心
ls anything the matter? You seemed very gloomy all weekend.

1151
01:11:20,295 --> 01:11:23,395
 我想和你谈谈 谈什么
l wanted to talk to you. What about?

1152
01:11:24,428 --> 01:11:26,562
我们
Us.

1153
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:28,996
有什么问题吗
ls something wrong?

1154
01:11:30,896 --> 01:11:33,196
是的，有点
Yeah. there is.

1155
01:11:34,696 --> 01:11:35,696
是什么
What?

1156
01:11:35,763 --> 01:11:38,830
是市场规划失误的事吗
lf you're still taking a hammering financially in the market,

1157
01:11:38,897 --> 01:11:40,363
你知道那没关系的
you know it's not a problem.

1158
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:43,564
我不能什么都依赖你父亲 克洛伊
l can't keep leaning on your father, Ohloe.

1159
01:11:44,664 --> 01:11:47,964
家庭和财富
Papa gets more pleasure out of helping his family,

1160
01:11:48,031 --> 01:11:51,565
爸爸更看重家庭 你知道的
than all the possessions he owns. You know that.

1161
01:11:54,598 --> 01:11:56,298
到底是什么
What is it?

1162
01:12:00,865 --> 01:12:04,199
是不是和你接的那些电话有关
ls it something to do with those phone calls you kept getting?

1163
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:08,566
你每次讲完电话都有点怪怪的
Because you acted really strangely after each of them.

1164
01:12:12,933 --> 01:12:15,334
你在外面拈花惹草了?
Are you having an affair?

1165
01:12:16,267 --> 01:12:18,534
拈花惹草?
Am l having an affair?

1166
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:20,701
是啊，拈花惹草
Yeah, that's what l asked.

1167
01:12:22,701 --> 01:12:25,068
 没有 骗人
No. You are.

1168
01:12:25,135 --> 01:12:27,335
当然没有，别傻了
Of course l'm not. Don't be silly.

1169
01:12:38,136 --> 01:12:40,636
那你不再爱我了吗
Do you not love me anymore?

1170
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:45,070
我当然爱你
Of course l love you.

1171
01:12:46,303 --> 01:12:48,437
那到底是什么事
Well, what's wrong?

1172
01:12:51,637 --> 01:12:53,871
我只是觉得让你失望了
l just feel like l'm letting you down.

1173
01:12:53,937 --> 01:12:55,971
没有啊，怎么会
You're not. How?

1174
01:12:58,971 --> 01:13:01,605
是不是因为我没有怀孕
ls it because l'm not getting pregnant?

1175
01:13:04,905 --> 01:13:06,905
我只是
l just...

1176
01:13:07,572 --> 01:13:09,972
觉得对不起你
...feel so guilty.

1177
01:13:10,772 --> 01:13:13,473
很对不起你
So terribly guilty.

1178
01:13:13,573 --> 01:13:15,906
听着, 克里斯
Listen, Ohris.

1179
01:13:15,973 --> 01:13:19,407
我们都去看过医生了 我们的身体没什么问题
We've both been to the doctor. We're both perfectly healthy.

1180
01:13:19,473 --> 01:13:23,940
我相信你完全有能力让我怀孕
l can conceive and you're perfectly capable of making a woman pregnant.

1181
01:13:25,607 --> 01:13:29,908
我从来都没有因为这事生过你的气
ls it me? Have l been horribly pushy and obnoxious on the subject?

1182
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:35,608
我只是想要个孩子 想要个我们的孩子
Look, l... l just want a baby. l want to have our baby.

1183
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:40,275
我们只是运气不好
We haven't been lucky yet, that's all.

1184
01:13:43,876 --> 01:13:45,443
克洛伊
Oh, Ohloe.

1185
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:53,643
我们不要再讨论这个了
Let's get off the subject.

1186
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:57,710
谈到生孩子 应该会让我们很高兴和兴奋才对
Having a child should be something that makes us both happy and excited,

1187
01:13:57,777 --> 01:14:01,544
而不是像现在这样那么紧张和焦虑
not a cause of all this tension and anxiety and...

1188
01:14:05,178 --> 01:14:07,178
我很想找个人吐吐苦水
l had to talk to somebody.

1189
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:09,812
我很矛盾
l'm really suffering.

1190
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:12,979
无论你和我说了什么 都不会有第三个人知道
Whatever you tell me goes no further.

1191
01:14:14,212 --> 01:14:17,212
我想为了一个女人离开我的妻子
l'm contemplating leaving my wife for another woman.

1192
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,579
但每次话到嘴边
But when the time came to tell her...

1193
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,213
却又说不出口
...l couldn't do it.

1194
01:14:23,313 --> 01:14:25,780
这个不是世界上最容易做的事 不是吗
Yeah, well, it's not the easiest thing in the world to do, is it?

1195
01:14:27,947 --> 01:14:29,614
这很疯狂
lt's crazy.

1196
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,614
和那个女人没什么前途
l can see no real future with this other woman.

1197
01:14:33,781 --> 01:14:36,048
而且我和我老婆生活的很舒适
And l have a very comfortable life with my wife.

1198
01:14:36,114 --> 01:14:39,448
 是啊，但如果你不爱她 我没有说我不爱她
Yeah, but if you don't love her... l'm not saying l don't love her.

1199
01:14:39,515 --> 01:14:42,115
只是感觉不一样
Just not in the way l feel about this other woman.

1200
01:14:42,182 --> 01:14:43,882
明白了
Right.

1201
01:14:44,615 --> 01:14:47,782
归纳起来就好象是性和爱的区别
Maybe it's finally the difference between love and lust.

1202
01:14:47,882 --> 01:14:50,349
但如果我离开克洛伊 我还能做些什么
But what the hell am l going to do if l leave Ohloe?

1203
01:14:52,649 --> 01:14:56,283
我还没有傻到不清楚 自己现在过的是什么生活
l don't fool myself that l haven't gotten used to a certain kind of living.

1204
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:59,750
难道应该放弃这一切? 为了什么
Am l supposed to give it all up? For what?

1205
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:01,984
为一个你爱的女人
ls it for a woman you love?

1206
01:15:02,084 --> 01:15:04,784
怎么生活，在哪里生活
to live how? Where?

1207
01:15:05,117 --> 01:15:08,084
 做什么工作 这个嘛，看上去
to work as what? Well, it seems to me that you...

1208
01:15:08,151 --> 01:15:10,051
你已经很擅长做生意了
You're pretty good at what you're doing.

1209
01:15:10,118 --> 01:15:13,218
你可以重新找一个 和现在差不多的工作
there must be anotherjob in another firm that you can just, you know...

1210
01:15:13,285 --> 01:15:16,352
怎么可能 我现在是我老板的女婿
Let's face it, l'm the boss's son in law.

1211
01:15:16,418 --> 01:15:18,519
而且他那么疼我
And he loves me.

1212
01:15:19,652 --> 01:15:22,119
看上去这个女人并不足以
Doesn't seem to me like you want this other woman enough

1213
01:15:22,186 --> 01:15:24,786
让你放弃 你好不容易得来的这一切
to give up everything you've achieved for it.

1214
01:15:25,419 --> 01:15:27,653
我们要去度三礼拜假
We're going away for three weeks.

1215
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:30,753
 回来后我会和她坦白的 等你回来?
When l get back l'll tell her. When you get back?

1216
01:15:31,787 --> 01:15:34,220
那我怎么办 别敷衍我了
What am l supposed to do? Stop playing games with me!

1217
01:15:34,287 --> 01:15:37,587
 我没有敷衍你 为什么你不现在就告诉她
l'm not playing games with you. Why don't you just tell her now then?

1218
01:15:37,687 --> 01:15:39,854
你不是说和她一起生活很虚伪吗
l'd think you'd want to stop living such a sham.

1219
01:15:39,954 --> 01:15:42,921
 这很难开口 为什么
Look, it's not easy. Why not?

1220
01:15:42,988 --> 01:15:45,988
你已经厌烦了她 而且你每次都说
lf you're so bored at home with her and you're so crazy about me,

1221
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:47,488
你爱的是我
which is all you ever tell me...

1222
01:15:47,555 --> 01:15:50,355
我不想把大家的假期都搞砸好不好?
l don't wanna mess this holiday up for everybody, Ok?

1223
01:15:51,622 --> 01:15:53,589
这是很大的打击
lt's a big blow.

1224
01:15:53,655 --> 01:15:55,822
对每一个人都会有巨大的影响
And it's gonna make a huge impact on everyone.

1225
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:59,256
你怎么可以和一个
How can you go on vacation with a woman that you know you're gonna leave

1226
01:15:59,323 --> 01:16:01,423
 假期一完你就和她离婚的女人去度假 小声一点
the minute you get back? keep your voice down.

1227
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:04,090
你想知道我什么感受吗 我嫉妒，好吗
You wanna know how l feel? l'm jealous, Ok?

1228
01:16:04,156 --> 01:16:06,257
我不喜欢你和她做爱
l don't like the idea of you making love with her.

1229
01:16:06,323 --> 01:16:10,557
我不喜欢你和她旅行浪漫的样子
l don't like the idea of you going off island hopping with her. lt's romantic!

1230
01:16:10,624 --> 01:16:12,657
嘿，小声点
Hey, keep your voice down.

1231
01:16:13,657 --> 01:16:15,858
你知道我和她做爱
You know l make love to her.

1232
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:18,425
只不过是例行公事
And you know it's just routine.

1233
01:16:19,191 --> 01:16:21,958
难道你就不能等几星期吗
For God's sakes, can't you wait a few weeks?

1234
01:16:24,325 --> 01:16:25,925
好吧
Yeah.

1235
01:16:27,259 --> 01:16:30,092
我只是要你和她说清楚
l just wanna know that something's gonna happen, you know?

1236
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,826
我会的
lt will.

1237
01:16:33,159 --> 01:16:35,360
 我会的 好
lt will. Ok.

1238
01:16:40,027 --> 01:16:41,794
假期取消了
the holiday's off.

1239
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,327
为什么 怎么了
Why? What happened?

1240
01:16:43,394 --> 01:16:45,561
刘易斯要做手术
Maurice Lewis has to go in for an operation.

1241
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:47,794
他怎么了
Why?

1242
01:16:47,861 --> 01:16:50,261
背上有一些碎片什么的 他没法走路
Disc in his back or something. He can't walk.

1243
01:16:50,361 --> 01:16:52,128
总而言之 要一段时间才能康复
Anyway, he needs recovery time

1244
01:16:52,228 --> 01:16:55,462
大家认为可以把假期推迟到夏季以后
and everyone thought we should just move it till after the summer.

1245
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:56,995
我得把行李收拾一下
Let me just pack up my stuff.

1246
01:16:57,062 --> 01:16:59,595
我们可以步行去歌剧院 很近的
We should probably walk to the opera, it's so close.

1247
01:16:59,695 --> 01:17:01,362
好
Yeah.

1248
01:17:17,397 --> 01:17:18,464
喂
Hello?

1249
01:17:31,465 --> 01:17:33,432
喂
Hello?

1250
01:17:49,634 --> 01:17:51,467
机会来了, 克里斯
An opportunity has arisen, Ohris,

1251
01:17:51,534 --> 01:17:53,534
而且我认为对你有好处
which l think may be a lucrative one for you.

1252
01:17:53,601 --> 01:17:54,601
是吗
Really?

1253
01:17:54,668 --> 01:17:56,701
我们正在和一家日本公司协商
We're structuring something with a Japanese company.

1254
01:17:56,768 --> 01:17:59,901
这是一个独立项目 可以赚很多钱
lt's an independent operation. there's a great deal of money to be made.

1255
01:18:00,001 --> 01:18:04,368
我的看法是最先出资的人 将会获得暴利
And my thought was, anyone in on the ground floor stands to profit hugely,

1256
01:18:04,468 --> 01:18:06,669
如果预测正确的话
assuming our predictions are correct.

1257
01:18:06,769 --> 01:18:08,169
 听起来不错 是的
Sounds exciting. lt is.

1258
01:18:08,236 --> 01:18:11,202
埃莉诺 我把这个好消息和克里斯说了
Eleanor. l've just told Ohris the good news.

1259
01:18:11,303 --> 01:18:14,203
但现在让我最开心的事 和钱不关
But what would make me the happiest has nothing to do with money.

1260
01:18:14,269 --> 01:18:16,336
我更喜欢让自己看上去 像一个年轻的奶奶
l'd like you to make me a young grandmother.

1261
01:18:16,403 --> 01:18:18,403
你已经是一个年轻的奶奶了
You already are a young grandmother.

1262
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:20,737
没错 汤姆和希瑟有打算再给我生一个孙子
Yes. tom and Heather are trying for their second,

1263
01:18:20,803 --> 01:18:22,804
但我更想你成为妈妈
but l'd like you to be a mother.

1264
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:25,104
好了 别那样看我
Oh, all right. Don't look at me like that.

1265
01:18:25,171 --> 01:18:28,338
不说就是了 你生日想要写什么
l'll be quiet. What would you like for your birthday?

1266
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:30,138
 我不知道 你生日?
l don't know. Your birthday?

1267
01:18:30,204 --> 01:18:32,171
很好嘛，你居然忘了
Great. You forgot.

1268
01:18:32,238 --> 01:18:34,872
其实没有 我已经买好礼物了
l didn't actually. l bought you something already.

1269
01:18:34,938 --> 01:18:36,638
看来我的暗示起作用了
So my hints worked.

1270
01:18:37,705 --> 01:18:39,805
 妈咪 知道了，知道了
Mummy... l knew. l knew.

1271
01:18:39,872 --> 01:18:40,872
我们很努力了，我们不想... 好吧
We are trying. We don't want to... All right.

1272
01:18:40,972 --> 01:18:43,206
 喂 克里斯
Hello? Ohris?

1273
01:18:43,306 --> 01:18:44,506
 失陪一下 你随意
Excuse me. By all means.

1274
01:18:44,606 --> 01:18:46,073
我很生气 是的，亲爱的
l weigh as much as l did. Yes, darling.

1275
01:18:46,173 --> 01:18:47,739
别急好吗？ 我嘴巴太大了
Look, please relax, Ok? l spoke out of turn.

1276
01:18:47,839 --> 01:18:49,406
 嘿，嘿 对不起，对不起
Hey. Hey. l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

1277
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:50,806
 你们俩在唠叨什么呢 没什么
What are you two bickering about? Nothing.

1278
01:18:50,873 --> 01:18:53,140
我告诉过你不要给我打电话 我会打给你的
l told you not to call me, l'd call you.

1279
01:18:53,273 --> 01:18:55,774
我一直在等你打来
Well, l... l... l was waiting for you to call.

1280
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,174
我都等了一个礼拜了
l've been waiting a week.

1281
01:18:57,374 --> 01:19:00,141
这里到处都是人 我不方便说话
Well, there's always people around and l can't talk.

1282
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,241
你什么时候回家
When are you coming home?

1283
01:19:02,408 --> 01:19:03,808
两礼拜后
ln about two weeks.

1284
01:19:03,874 --> 01:19:06,541
两礼拜? 你说整个旅行才三个礼拜
About two weeks? You said the whole trip was three weeks!

1285
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:07,975
对啊，就三个礼拜啊
Yeah, right. three weeks.

1286
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:09,842
克里斯, 爸爸和妈妈要走了
Ohris, Mummy and Papa are leaving.

1287
01:19:09,908 --> 01:19:11,809
马上，马上
Ok. Ok...

1288
01:19:11,975 --> 01:19:13,709
谁在说话 你到底在哪啊
Who is that? What country are you in?

1289
01:19:13,775 --> 01:19:15,842
你手机应该打不通的
Your mobile's been impossible.

1290
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:18,343
跟你说了我在希腊
l told you. l'm in Greece.

1291
01:19:18,443 --> 01:19:20,909
周围都是人 我不方便说话
And there's always people around, so l can't talk.

1292
01:19:20,976 --> 01:19:23,543
我和快就回家了 回去再打给你
l said l'd be home soon, and l will call you.

1293
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:26,543
我只是有点寂寞 我等不及了
l'm just lonely. l'm anxious.

1294
01:19:26,643 --> 01:19:28,077
你能不能
Oan you just...?

1295
01:19:28,577 --> 01:19:30,710
一回到家就和克洛伊摊牌
Please tell Ohloe as soon as you get home.

1296
01:19:30,777 --> 01:19:33,511
我只是想早点把这种情况解决
l just want this situation to be resolved.

1297
01:19:34,044 --> 01:19:35,844
你想我吗
Do you miss me?

1298
01:19:35,911 --> 01:19:37,911
好了 再见，再见
Ok. Bye, bye.

1299
01:19:38,911 --> 01:19:41,178
 没什么事吧 没有，都很好

1300
01:19:41,245 --> 01:19:42,978
 你们要走了吗 是的
Are you leaving already? Yeah.

1301
01:20:09,581 --> 01:20:12,315
克里斯，我是诺拉 你在哪里
Ohris, it's Nola. Where have l reached you?

1302
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:14,315
撒丁岛
Sardinia.

1303
01:20:14,381 --> 01:20:16,648
五六天后就回来 好吗
l'll be back in five or six days, Ok?

1304
01:20:27,316 --> 01:20:29,583
 早上好，约翰 你比以前早了啊，先生
Good morning, John. Oh, you're early, sir.

1305

 我这就去把车开来 好的
l'll bring the car around. Yes.

1306
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,784
你骗我
You lied to me.

1307
01:20:38,884 --> 01:20:40,417
 哦，天哪 你骗我
Oh, Jesus. You lied to me!

1308
01:20:40,517 --> 01:20:41,984
 安静点 我要去找克洛伊
Quiet! l wanna see Ohloe!

1309
01:20:42,084 --> 01:20:43,851
 安静点 我要去找克洛伊

l wanna talk to Ohloe. You're a liar! You're a liar!

l can explain. l... taxi!

1314
01:20:48,785 --> 01:20:50,118
 我不要跟你走 计程车
l'm not going anywhere with you. taxi!

1315
01:20:50,185 --> 01:20:52,419
 我哪里也不去 冷静点
l'm not going anywhere with you. Oalm down.

1316
01:20:52,485 --> 01:20:55,319
 诺拉，诺拉，冷静点 你是个骗子，你是个骗子
Nola! Nola, calm down. Oalm down. You're a liar! You're a liar!

1317
01:20:55,386 --> 01:20:56,886
我提前回来了 我提前回来了
l came home deliberately, l came home early.

1318
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:59,453
你这个骗子 我要去找克洛伊
You're a liar! l wanna talk to Ohloe.

1319
01:20:59,519 --> 01:21:02,120
 我要去找克洛伊 冷静点，冷静点
l wanna talk to Ohloe! Oalm down. Oalm the fuck down!

1320
01:21:02,186 --> 01:21:06,053
我要去找克洛伊 你这个骗子，你这个骗子
l wanna talk to Ohloe. You liar! You're a liar!

1321
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,020
你是个骗子
You're a liar!

1322
01:21:11,987 --> 01:21:14,921
我提前回来了 因为这事让我受不了
l decided to cut the trip short because all this is eating away at me.

1323
01:21:15,021 --> 01:21:16,821
我前天才回来
l only came back the day before yesterday

1324
01:21:16,888 --> 01:21:19,055
我要一周没有你骚扰的时间
because l need a week in the city to deal with Ohloe

1325
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:21,955
 来慢慢和克洛伊说 你快要把我逼疯了
without you breathing down my neck. You're driving me crazy!

1326
01:21:22,022 --> 01:21:23,955
我不知道是否要相信你
l don't know whether to believe you or not.

1327
01:21:24,022 --> 01:21:25,822
 相信我, 诺拉 你跟她说了吗
Please believe me, Nola. Well, did you tell her?

1328
01:21:25,889 --> 01:21:27,222
我刚要告诉她你就打来了
l was about to when you called.

1329
01:21:27,289 --> 01:21:28,356
跟打电话有什么关系
What does that have to do with anything?

1330
01:21:28,422 --> 01:21:29,589
 我被你搅乱了 得了吧
l got flustered. Oh, please!

1331
01:21:29,656 --> 01:21:31,189
我正准备好要告诉她 你就打来了
l was all set to tell her and then you called,

1332
01:21:31,256 --> 01:21:33,289
我骗你还在希腊是我的错
and then l feel guilty about telling you that l'm still in Greece.

1333
01:21:33,356 --> 01:21:36,023
 你说你在撒丁岛 我说的太快了
You said Sardinia. l... l was talking fast.

1334
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:38,523
我不想让她知道我在讲什么
l... l didn't want her to know what l was talking about.

1335
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:40,190
最终她还是要知道的
Well, she has to know eventually.

1336
01:21:40,523 --> 01:21:42,490
 我开不了口 那让我来
l can't tell her. then l will.

1337
01:21:42,557 --> 01:21:43,557
诺拉，别这样
Nola, stop!

1338
01:21:43,624 --> 01:21:45,891
这太荒谬了 我们都有孩子了
Well, this is crazy. We're having a child together!

1339
01:21:45,991 --> 01:21:47,524
我们没必要非得要这个孩子
We don't have to have a child together.

1340
01:21:47,624 --> 01:21:49,358
没有这个孩子 我们会生活的简单点
lt would make life a hell of a lot simpler if we didn't.

1341
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:51,491
对你简单 对我不是
Yeah, simpler for you, but not for me.

1342
01:21:52,591 --> 01:21:54,858
就算把孩子生下来
lt occurred to me that even if you had the child,

1343
01:21:54,925 --> 01:21:57,592
 我也可以提供经济上的帮助 那样是不够的
l could help you out financially. that's not enough.

1344
01:21:57,658 --> 01:21:59,592
诺拉，讲点道理
Nola, be reasonable.

1345
01:21:59,659 --> 01:22:02,659
汤姆和我分手时也是这么说的
that's exactly what tom said when he broke off our engagement.

1346
01:22:02,726 --> 01:22:04,893
就是讲道理 才变成现在这个样子
Being reasonable got me where l am right now.

1347
01:22:04,959 --> 01:22:06,293
你是在威胁我吗
So, you're threatening me?

1348
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:08,960
如果我没按你说的做 你可以去告诉我老婆?
lf l don't do what you say, you're gonna go to my wife.

1349
01:22:09,293 --> 01:22:10,893
你以前是骗我的吗
Were you lying to me?

1350
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:12,460
所有那些你跟我做爱时
All those times we made love,

1351
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:15,527
说的话 都是骗我的吗
all those conversations, were you lying to me then?

1352
01:22:15,594 --> 01:22:18,127
 当然没有骗你 那就告诉克洛伊
Of course l wasn't lying. tell Ohloe.

1353
01:22:18,194 --> 01:22:22,028
一定得有人告诉她 你不做，就我来
Someone has to explain the situation. Either you do it, or l'll do it.

1354
01:22:23,128 --> 01:22:26,761
好，好 我会跟她说的
Ok, Ok. l'll do the right thing.

1355
01:24:21,906 --> 01:24:23,273
你们看见克里斯了吗
Have you seen Ohris?

1356
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:25,307
一分钟前往那边去了
A minute ago. He went that way.

1357
01:24:25,773 --> 01:24:27,473
克里斯
Ohris?

1358
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,407
克里斯
Ohris?

1359
01:24:30,574 --> 01:24:32,374
克里斯
Ohris?

1360
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,942
你在哪，克里斯
Where are you, Ohris?

1361
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,209
克里斯
Ohris?

1362
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:51,009
克洛伊 是你吗
Ohloe, are you there?

1363
01:24:51,076 --> 01:24:52,543
你看见克里斯了吗
Have you seen Ohris anywhere?

1364
01:24:52,643 --> 01:24:54,910
没有 你可以上来一会吗
No. Oould you come up for a minute?

1365
01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:57,610
这套衣服我想你给点意见
l want you to give me some advice about this dress.

1366
01:24:58,243 --> 01:25:00,210
好的
Yeah, Ok.

1367
01:25:25,713 --> 01:25:27,713
我明天就告诉克洛伊
l'm telling Ohloe tomorrow.

1368
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:30,513
你每天都这么说 每天都做不到
You say that every day, and you always back out.

1369
01:25:30,613 --> 01:25:33,580
然后我又得等多一天 我要结果，克里斯
l'm back where l started. l want something done, Ohris.

1370
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,680
如果你没有勇气说 就让我来说
lf you don't have the nerve to do it, l'll do it.

1371
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:38,647
你把这个作为对休伊特家族的复仇 是吗
that would be revenge for you against the whole Hewett family, wouldn't it?

1372
01:25:38,714 --> 01:25:40,747
你这样说什么意思
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1373
01:25:40,814 --> 01:25:43,581
如果你想我跟克洛伊说 你就不用亲自跟她说了
My theory is you want me to tell Ohloe so you don't have to do it yourself.

1374
01:25:43,648 --> 01:25:46,381
天哪 你说的这么自然就好象
My God, it seems like you've had this whole thing checked out

1375
01:25:46,448 --> 01:25:47,982
 做这个没什么负担是的 我也希望
by some psychiatrist. l wish.

1376
01:25:48,048 --> 01:25:51,148
我也希望有人来帮我们说 这所有事都是见不得人的
l wish had someone to confide in, but it's all so damn secretive.

1377
01:25:51,215 --> 01:25:53,682
克里斯 如果我不做点什么
Look, Ohris, if l don't do something about this,

1378
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:55,816
我们一定会分开的 我都有你孩子了
we're gonna grow apart. l'm having your child!

1379
01:25:55,882 --> 01:25:58,416
我明天就跟她说, 诺拉 不然你还想我怎么样
l'm telling her tomorrow, Nola. What more do you want me to do?

1380
01:25:58,483 --> 01:26:00,549
现在就告诉她 今晚就告诉她
What more? tell her now! tell her tonight!

1381
01:26:00,616 --> 01:26:03,916
睡觉前跟她说我做不到 那不是好时机
l can't, not before she goes to sleep. lt wouldn't be the right time.

1382
01:26:04,316 --> 01:26:05,950
诺拉，我明天说
Nola, tomorrow is fine.

1383
01:26:06,017 --> 01:26:10,250
 你明天什么时候回来 我都是6点半下班的啦
What time will you get back from work? Same time l always get off, 6:30.

1384
01:26:10,350 --> 01:26:11,817
那你6点三刻会在家吗
So you'll be home by a quarter to seven?

1385
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:15,451
当然，克里斯 老是讨论这个，我恨死自己了
Yeah. Ohris, you make me say these things. l hate myself for them.

1386
01:26:15,584 --> 01:26:17,751
 我只想我们在一起 我们会在一起的
l just want us to be together. We will be.

1387
01:26:19,685 --> 01:26:22,218
看芭蕾剧时 你太安静了
You were very nervy all through the ballet.

1388
01:26:22,285 --> 01:26:23,485
你不喜欢这部剧吗
Did you hate it?

1389
01:26:23,552 --> 01:26:26,219
 不是，我只是有点不舒服 是吗
No, l'm just out of sorts. Yeah.

1390
01:26:26,285 --> 01:26:28,152
我还以为你昏过去了
l thought you were gonna pass out.

1391
01:26:28,219 --> 01:26:30,519
低血糖，一会就没事了
Low blood sugar. l'll be better soon.

1392
01:26:33,486 --> 01:26:35,786
今晚我还是不能和你做
l still can't do it with you tonight.

1393
01:26:35,853 --> 01:26:38,287
我那个还没完
l'm not over my little dose of whatever.

1394
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,521
清洁工有没有把我的网球衫 放在你的工具包里
Did the cleaner put one of my tennis shirts in with your gear?

1395
01:26:45,621 --> 01:26:46,721
没有 你在做什么
No. What are you doing?

1396
01:26:46,821 --> 01:26:48,454
是吗，我看看
Really? Just let me have a quick look.

1397
01:26:48,554 --> 01:26:50,488
 我哪里都找不到 别，让我来，让我来
l can't find it anywhere. No. Look, l'll check, l'll check.

1398
01:26:50,554 --> 01:26:54,421
 我都整理好了的 我也不会弄乱的
l've got everything arranged in there. Ok. l wasn't gonna disturb anything.

1399
01:26:54,488 --> 01:26:56,222
我不知道还可能在哪里
'Oause l don't know where else it can be.

1400
01:26:56,288 --> 01:26:59,122
她老是把我的东西和你的搞混
She's always bloody mixing my stuff in with yours.

1401
01:27:03,256 --> 01:27:04,256
是这件吗
ls this it?

1402
01:27:04,322 --> 01:27:06,889
看，我就知道 她总是那么粗心
See, l knew it! She always bloody does that.

1403
01:27:06,956 --> 01:27:08,890
我得去和她说说
l've got to have words with her about it.

1404
01:27:08,956 --> 01:27:10,556
真是的
lt's really...

1405
01:27:10,623 --> 01:27:12,357
你把什么放进口袋了
What did you just put in your pocket?

1406
01:27:12,423 --> 01:27:15,057
 哦，药盒而已 什么药盒
Oh, it's just my pill box. What do you mean a pill box?

1407
01:27:15,124 --> 01:27:16,490
药盒而已 你知道药盒是怎么样的
A pill box. You know what a pill box looks like.

1408
01:27:16,557 --> 01:27:18,257
让我看看 你在吃什么药?
Let me have a look at it. What pills are you taking?

1409
01:27:18,324 --> 01:27:19,891
不行，只是药盒而已 我需要它们
No, they're just my pills. l need them.

1410
01:27:19,957 --> 01:27:22,558
不...缓解压力的 因为你给我太多压力了
No, no, no, it's for stress, 'cause you stress me so much.

1411
01:27:22,658 --> 01:27:23,824
 知道吗 什么
Guess what? What?

1412
01:27:23,924 --> 01:27:26,325
我买了明晚的戏票
l got tickets for the theater for tomorrow night.

1413
01:27:26,391 --> 01:27:28,358
不可能 一点都不像你
You haven't. that's not like you.

1414
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:30,692
 什么剧 《白宫女人》
What for? the Woman in White.

1415
01:27:30,758 --> 01:27:33,592
 我听说很不错 我还以为你讨厌音乐剧
l heard it's great. l thought you hated musicals.

1416
01:27:33,659 --> 01:27:35,359
不，不是那样的
No, that's not so.

1417
01:27:35,426 --> 01:27:38,893
 你喜欢这个音乐剧就行了 太棒了
And anyway, you love his music. Well, that's great.

1418
01:27:38,959 --> 01:27:40,893
我在剧院门口和你碰面吧
l'll have to meet you outside the theater,

1419
01:27:40,959 --> 01:27:43,326
我从画廊直接过去就行了
'cause l'll be coming straight from the gallery.

1420
01:27:43,393 --> 01:27:45,127
为什么不把司机带上
Why don't you take the chauffeur?

1421
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:48,794
我叫计程车就行了 运气好的话我还可以玩一个小时网球
l'll grab a taxi, and with any luck l can get an hour of tennis in.

1422
01:27:49,727 --> 01:27:51,861
你真是太体贴了
You're so sweet.

1423
01:27:51,927 --> 01:27:54,394
你不知道我多想你对我这样好
You knew how much l wanted to see that.

1424
01:27:57,461 --> 01:28:00,228
好了，去睡觉吧 你也累了，亲爱的
All right, come to bed, because you're tired, my darling.

1429
01:28:14,596 --> 01:28:17,830
一切都处理好了 但电话上说不清楚
Everything's taken care of, but l'm reluctant to talk on the phone.

1430
01:28:17,897 --> 01:28:19,763
你下班后马上回来见我
You've got to meet me right after work.

1431
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:22,530
我们得..计划计划
We have... plans to make.

1432
01:28:23,497 --> 01:28:26,797

 是他吗 是的
Was it him? Yeah.

1436
01:28:36,498 --> 01:28:39,532
你们得在前六个月准备好资金
So, you'll have to be prepared to cash flow the first six months.

1437
01:28:39,632 --> 01:28:41,766
是这样的吗，克里斯 是半年吗
ls that right, Ohris? A half year?

1438
01:28:41,866 --> 01:28:42,832
是的
Yes.

1439
01:28:42,932 --> 01:28:45,566
半年应该够了 说不定不用那么久
A half year should do it, maybe less.

1440
01:28:45,633 --> 01:28:48,300
好，非常好 下次见

1444

We met here last...

1450
01:30:36,577 --> 01:30:38,977
对不起 我不让陌生人进门的

1451
01:30:39,044 --> 01:30:41,044
你不记得了吗 我们见过的
But... but, do you not remember? We met...

1452
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:45,678
她问了你一些鼠害的事
She asked you something about your trouble with your mice,

1453
01:30:45,745 --> 01:30:48,345
你提到了花生酱
and you mentioned something about peanut butter.

1454
01:30:48,412 --> 01:30:51,412
哦，对，对

No trouble at all really, and l... l don't mean to disturb you.

1458
01:30:59,813 --> 01:31:03,746
我只是想看看你家的电视接受情况
l was wondering if l could... could look at your tv reception.

1459
01:31:03,846 --> 01:31:07,313
 诺拉那边的有点问题 电视吗
We seem to have trouble next door. Oh, with the tv?

1460
01:31:07,413 --> 01:31:08,414

1461
01:31:08,514 --> 01:31:12,447
我们有些小矛盾 今晚有诺拉最爱看的电视
We're getting some interference, and it's Nola's favorite tv night.

1462
01:31:12,547 --> 01:31:15,748
所以我不知道是屋顶的天线问题 还是我们电视的问题
So l don't know if it's the aerial on the roof or if it's us.

1463
01:31:15,814 --> 01:31:17,814
 在那边 谢谢

there was no trouble before. l had it on and it was fine.

1466
01:32:02,886 --> 01:32:05,886
你上次不是说你叫哈里斯吗
Didn't you say your name was Harris?

1467
01:35:48,342 --> 01:35:50,342

1483
01:38:46,693 --> 01:38:48,126
晚上好
Good evening. Hello.

1484
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,227

How much? that's two pounds, please.

1485
01:38:55,294 --> 01:38:56,794
2英镑
two pounds.

1486
01:39:01,928 --> 01:39:03,928
 2英镑，这是我的票吗 是的，谢谢
two pounds. My tickets? Yes. thank you.

1487
01:39:21,363 --> 01:39:22,963
这里真是一团糟，长官
lt's a terrible mess in there, sir.

1488
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:25,097
我想很容易就知道 这里发生了什么事
Well, l think it's pretty obvious what's happened here.

1489
01:39:25,163 --> 01:39:27,163
有人抢劫并杀害了这位老太太
Someone's robbed and killed the old lady.

1490
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:28,564
当他或者他们跑出去的时候
As he, or they, were running out

1491
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:31,130
刚好撞到赖斯小姐进来 出于惊慌
they've run into the Rice woman coming in, so they've shot her too.

1492
01:39:31,197 --> 01:39:32,497
他们把她也杀了
Either out of panic,

1493
01:39:32,564 --> 01:39:35,564
又或者他们抢了她后杀人灭口
or because they saw a chance to make an additional score.

1494
01:39:35,631 --> 01:39:38,231
可怜的家伙回家时间不对
Poor unsuspecting soul came home at the wrong moment.

1495
01:39:38,298 --> 01:39:40,431
房子里所有的处方药都没了
He's cleared out the house of all prescription drugs, sir.

1496
01:39:40,498 --> 01:39:42,865
毫无疑问这件劫案涉及毒品
Oh, no, it's definitely a drugs related robbery.

1497
01:39:42,965 --> 01:39:45,332
劫犯可能事先就知道8楼住着老太太
He might have known there was an old lady living in flat 8.

1498
01:39:45,399 --> 01:39:46,732
计划抢劫她
Probably cased her.

1499
01:39:46,799 --> 01:39:49,166
没想到另外一个女人撞了进来
Was surprised by running into the other woman.

1500
01:39:49,232 --> 01:39:51,233
她选择了错误的时间回家
She picked the wrong time to come home.

1501
01:39:51,766 --> 01:39:53,966
有些人就是没运气
Some people just don't have any luck.

1502
01:39:55,466 --> 01:39:57,967
对，我刚和她说过话 太难以置信了
Yeah, l just spoke to her. this is unbelievable.

1503
01:39:58,033 --> 01:39:59,933
半个小时前我下楼
Half an hour ago l came down the stairs,

1504
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,634
顺便敲了艾斯比太太的门 因为
knocked on Mrs. Eastby's door 'cause l couldn't...

1505
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:02,900
你需要汽车上的什么吗
Do you need anything from the car?

1506
01:40:02,967 --> 01:40:05,001
是的，叫验尸官快点来
Yeah. You can tell the exhibits officer to get a move on,

1507
01:40:05,067 --> 01:40:08,334
 现场快被搞砸了 这个很重要
'cause this is getting ridiculous. Yeah, this is quite important.

1508
01:40:08,401 --> 01:40:10,301
她通常在今天烘烤 我想她可能用完了材料
She usually bakes today, and l thought maybe she'd run out of stuff.

1509
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:12,101
所以我问她 需不需要帮她带点什么
So l asked her if she needed anything, and then

1510
01:40:12,168 --> 01:40:13,501
 半个小时前? 你和她说过话? 她没应我
So, half an hour ago? Spoke to her? she didn't answer.

1511
01:40:13,568 --> 01:40:16,335
 对，半个小时前 那时候罪犯一定还在里面
Yeah, half an hour ago. Yeah. So whoever it was, was still in there.

1512
01:40:16,402 --> 01:40:18,135
真可怕 真不敢相信
that's terrifying. l can't believe that.

1513
01:40:18,202 --> 01:40:20,835
你刚才和诺拉·赖斯说过话?
So someone was in there...? And you spoke to Nola Rice,

1514
01:40:20,935 --> 01:40:22,902
 她说了些什么 打断一下
and did she say anything? Sorry to interrupt.

1515
01:40:22,969 --> 01:40:24,669
摄影师可以进去了吗
Oould we send the photographers in now, please?

1516
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:25,869
不行，先等会
No, hang on. lf you just wait.

1517
01:40:25,969 --> 01:40:28,336
我们得先让验尸官进去取证
We've just got to get the exhibit officer in there first.

1518
01:40:28,403 --> 01:40:31,670
奎斯, 让摄影师在那等会
Ohris, Ohris, can you liaise with this man here?

1519
01:40:31,737 --> 01:40:34,237
等等 别让他进去
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Just catch him there.

1520
01:40:34,303 --> 01:40:36,704
我就在这里遇见诺拉
Well, l ran... Yeah, l bumped into Nola right here...

1521
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:38,637
犯罪现场马上就要清理了 是吗
Scenes of Orime will be on their way very shortly, all right?

1522
01:40:38,704 --> 01:40:40,004
是的
Yeah... Yeah, l spoke...

1523
01:40:40,071 --> 01:40:42,238
我在这里遇到她 我们聊了两句
l bumped into her here. We talked and we chatted.

1524
01:40:42,304 --> 01:40:44,204
我以前向她推荐过一款音乐播放器
l recommended a piece of music equipment.

1525
01:40:44,271 --> 01:40:46,705
 她买了 那是什么
She'd bought it. Yeah, and... Music equipment? What was that?

1526
01:40:46,771 --> 01:40:50,105
就是一款CD机 可以播放MP3，CD之类的
Nothing. lt was a portable OD player which reads MP3s, OD rewrites...

1527
01:40:50,172 --> 01:40:52,205
是毒品, 探长 他们为了毒品抢劫的
lt's drugs, guv. Someone after money for some drugs.

1528
01:40:52,272 --> 01:40:54,372
艾斯比太太不是很有钱啊
Well, Mrs. Eastby wasn't wealthy.

1529
01:40:54,439 --> 01:40:55,706
 他们才不管 毒品
they don't care. Drugs?

1530
01:40:55,806 --> 01:40:58,673
对，绝对是毒品 他们为了钱抢劫
Yeah, definitely drugs. Someone after money for 'em, and...

1531
01:40:58,739 --> 01:41:00,806
如果他们想的话 他们会为了1英磅就杀了你
they'll kill you for a pound if they wanted to, you know.

1532
01:41:00,906 --> 01:41:02,306
这样的事真让人遗憾 不是吗
Well, it's a sorry state of affairs, isn't it?

1533
01:41:02,373 --> 01:41:05,740
是啊，老太太很少出门 基本上没什么冤家
Well, it's not as if the old lady had any enemies. She rarely went out.

1534
01:41:05,807 --> 01:41:07,107
 猎枪干的 猎枪?
Used a shotgun. A shotgun?

1535
01:41:07,173 --> 01:41:08,874
猎枪很长 不是吗
that's a... that's a bit obvious, isn't it?

1536
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:11,040
 一定容易被看到 如果被锯短了呢
Somebody must've seen something. Oh, not if it was sawn off.

1537
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:14,107
猎枪可以被弄的非常小 凯瑟琳，你不能停在那里
they can make them pretty small. Oatherine, love, you can't park there.

1538
01:41:14,174 --> 01:41:16,374
把那空出来 待会要放尸体
Leave that clear. We've got the SOOO coming down.

1539
01:41:18,175 --> 01:41:20,408
你喜欢昨晚的音乐剧吗

1544
01:41:35,210 --> 01:41:38,643

 诺拉·赖斯 怎么了

01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:01,346
上面说，她下班回家
Apparently, she was coming home from work,

1551
01:42:01,412 --> 01:42:05,379
歹徒那时已经在那抢劫并杀了
and someone who was already there who'd burgled another flat and rob...

1552

And shot an old lady, ran into Nola by chance, and...

1553
01:42:08,013 --> 01:42:12,013
她那时刚进入大楼 歹徒逃跑时向她开了枪
She was entering the building, and he was running out and he shot her.

1554
01:42:12,113 --> 01:42:14,347

1569
01:42:54,284 --> 01:42:56,018
就连妈妈也被吓坏了
Well, even Mummy's really shaken up,

1570
01:42:56,084 --> 01:42:58,285
就算她们不是朋友
and you know they weren't exactly friends.

1571
01:42:58,351 --> 01:43:01,618
这里说那个地区的毒品犯罪率 在过去一年里
lt says here that there's been a rise in drug related crime in the area

1572
01:43:01,685 --> 01:43:03,585
有所上升
over the past year.

1573
01:43:03,652 --> 01:43:06,285
你听到了吗，对
Did you hear that? Yeah.

1574
01:43:06,352 --> 01:43:10,719
我只是觉得不可思议 只是...我知道
l just can't believe it. lt's just... l know.

1575
01:43:17,053 --> 01:43:18,453
妈咪
Mummy.

1576
01:43:20,587 --> 01:43:22,587
我有事情告诉你
l've got something to tell you.

1577
01:43:22,654 --> 01:43:24,687
但得等到克里斯也在这
But l want Ohris to be here.

1578
01:43:26,021 --> 01:43:27,888
克里斯
Ohris?

1579
01:43:27,954 --> 01:43:30,921
 他去哪了 我不知道
Where'd he go? l don't know.

1580
01:43:31,021 --> 01:43:32,988
刚刚还在这里的，克里斯
He was just in here. Ohris?

1581
01:43:33,688 --> 01:43:35,655
克里斯
Ohris?

1582
01:43:43,022 --> 01:43:44,356
他刚刚还在这里
He was just here.

1583
01:43:44,422 --> 01:43:46,089
说吧，你想告诉我什么
Well, what did you want to tell me?

1584
01:43:46,156 --> 01:43:48,623
等一下，克里斯
Just wait. Wait, wait. Ohris?

1585
01:44:20,959 --> 01:44:23,126
你在哪，克里斯
Where are you? Ohris?

1586
01:44:24,627 --> 01:44:25,893
你想告诉我什么
Well, what did you want to tell me?

1587
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,660
我想等他到了再说
Well, l just really want him to be here.

1588
01:44:27,727 --> 01:44:30,060
来了
Hang on, there he is. there you are!

1589
01:44:30,594 --> 01:44:32,727
 我们可以告诉她了吗 当然
Oan we tell her now? Sure.

1590
01:44:32,794 --> 01:44:35,028
我想你陪着我说嘛
Well, l wanted you to be here.

1591
01:44:35,094 --> 01:44:36,661
好了，什么事
Well, what is it?

1592
01:44:36,728 --> 01:44:38,195
妈咪
Mummy...

1593
01:44:38,295 --> 01:44:41,028
你终于可以为我开香摈了
You can finally crack open the champagne.

1594
01:44:41,128 --> 01:44:42,828
我怀孕了
lt looks like l'm pregnant.

1595
01:44:42,928 --> 01:44:45,195
 你什么时候知道的 今天早上
When did you hear? this morning.

1596
01:44:45,262 --> 01:44:49,062
哦，我太高兴了 天哪
Oh, l'm so delighted. Oh, good.

1597
01:44:49,696 --> 01:44:51,163
阿莱克

1598
01:44:51,263 --> 01:44:53,963
阿莱克，快到这来
Alec? Oome here.

1599
01:44:54,163 --> 01:44:56,596
我们都有点飘飘然了
We're both walking on air.

1600
01:44:56,663 --> 01:44:59,830
你当然飘飘然了 不过你老公有点震惊
Well, you're walking on air. Your husband looks a bit shell shocked.

1601
01:44:59,897 --> 01:45:01,764
 是我把他累坏了，可怜的家伙 什么事
'Oause l've exhausted him, poor thing. What?

1602
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:03,097
克洛伊怀孕了
Ohloe's pregnant.

1603
01:45:03,164 --> 01:45:05,631
今天是好日子啊 亲爱的，恭喜你
Oh, what a great day. Oh, my darling, congratulations.

1604
01:45:05,697 --> 01:45:08,098
我激动的打颤了 我真是太高兴了
l'm absolutely thrilled. l couldn't be more pleased.

1605
01:45:08,164 --> 01:45:09,798
多谢你雪中送炭

1606
01:45:09,864 --> 01:45:10,864
不好意思，先生 不好意思
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

1607
01:45:10,931 --> 01:45:12,465
 什么事 你的电话，你秘书
Yes? Phone call, sir. Your secretary.

真是太好了，不是吗 看看她，多开心啊
lt's wonderful, isn't it? Look at her, doesn't she look gorgeous?

1609

 玛格蕾，我怀孕了 恭喜你，太好了
Margaret, l'm pregnant! Oongratulations! that's wonderful.

1610
01:45:18,865 --> 01:45:20,299
谢谢你，玛格蕾

1611
01:45:21,232 --> 01:45:22,699
萨曼塔
Sam?

1612
01:45:22,766 --> 01:45:25,333
有个留言给你 迈克·班纳
Yeah, there's a message for you that a Mike Banner,

1613
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:27,299
迈克·班纳探长找过你
Detective Mike Banner, called.

1614
01:45:27,366 --> 01:45:30,500
他叫你打个电话给他 他在石河布什警局
He wants you to call him at Shepherd's Bush police station.

1615
01:45:30,966 --> 01:45:34,033
我认为不急 但他留下了电话
Yeah. No, l don't think it's urgent, but he left a number.

1616
01:45:34,133 --> 01:45:36,034
班纳
Banner? Sweetheart...

1617
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:37,500
我打赌是那个夜晚
l bet it was that night...

1618
01:45:37,567 --> 01:45:40,834
把号码给我吧
You better give me the number. Look, that's flattering.

1619
01:45:43,334 --> 01:45:46,801
上次你去，他说一切正常是吗
Well, the last time you went, he said everything was fine, didn't he?

1620
01:45:46,868 --> 01:45:49,035
是的，他让我完全放心了
Yes, and he just made me completely calm down.

1621
01:45:49,102 --> 01:45:51,302
难以置信，好极了
Oh, l just can't believe it. lt's marvelous.

1622
01:45:51,369 --> 01:45:52,969
谢谢你, 萨曼塔 再见
Ok. thanks, Samantha. Bye.

1623
01:45:53,069 --> 01:45:55,602
他有点古怪，有点不对劲
He just seemed odd, there was something weird.

1624
01:45:57,736 --> 01:46:00,936
奶奶要是知道会乐坏的 药物疗法
Granny would have been thrilled. ...alternative medicine.

1625
01:46:01,003 --> 01:46:04,170
奶奶肯定会高兴的 要是她在就好了
Granny would have loved it. l wish she could be here.

1626
01:46:04,236 --> 01:46:07,070
 感谢上帝，感谢上帝 恭喜

1627
01:46:07,137 --> 01:46:08,904
请找迈克·班纳探长
Detective Banner, please.

1628
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:10,970
这里是克里斯·维尔顿
this is Ohris Wilton.

1629
01:46:14,638 --> 01:46:15,638
你好
Oh, hello.

1630
01:46:15,704 --> 01:46:18,205
我是克里斯·维尔顿 你找我?
this is Ohris Wilton. You called?

1631
01:46:18,305 --> 01:46:21,172
哦，对 我想你能不能来我们这里一趟
Oh, yes. l was wondering if there was a time you could drop in here?

1632
01:46:21,238 --> 01:46:23,472
或者约个时间我们去找你也行
Or if it's more convenient, we can come and see you.

1633
01:46:23,538 --> 01:46:26,972
 什么事 电话里一时也说不清楚
ln reference to what? l'd rather not explain on the phone.

1634
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:30,306
只是问几个问题 我相信你会积极配合的
lt's just a few questions, and l'm sure you'd prefer it to be discreet.

1635
01:46:33,206 --> 01:46:35,440
没必要带律师，是吗
l've no reason to bring a lawyer, do l?

1636
01:46:35,506 --> 01:46:37,473
我希望不用
l certainly hope not.

1637
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,613
 克里斯·维尔顿，班纳探长 下午好
Ohris Wilton. Detective Banner. Good afternoon.

1638
01:47:46,713 --> 01:47:49,680
 你好，请坐 谢谢
How do you do? take a seat. thank you.

1639
01:47:50,614 --> 01:47:52,581
没有什么好担心的
this is nothing to be alarmed about.

1640
01:47:52,681 --> 01:47:56,748
我们只是在对贝蒂·艾斯比 诺拉·赖斯谋杀案 做常规调查
We're just doing a routine investigation into the Betty Eastby Nola Rice murders.

1641
01:47:58,348 --> 01:48:01,048
你认识这两个受害者吗
Were you acquainted with either of the victims?

1642
01:48:01,115 --> 01:48:03,482
老实说 我认识诺拉·赖斯
Peripherally, l knew Nola Rice.

1643
01:48:04,082 --> 01:48:05,349
怎么认识的
How?

1644
01:48:06,249 --> 01:48:09,516
她以前和我大舅子订过亲
She was engaged for a time to the man who's now my brother in law.

1645
01:48:09,582 --> 01:48:11,316
那是...
that's...

1646
01:48:11,983 --> 01:48:14,116
 汤姆·休伊特 是的
...tom Hewett? that's correct.

1647
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:19,183
他们分手了 大约一年前
they broke up. A year ago. More.

1648
01:48:20,683 --> 01:48:22,650
你上次见到她是什么时候
When did you last see her?

1649
01:48:23,584 --> 01:48:25,917
天哪 我记不起来了
Oh, God, l can't remember.

1650
01:48:29,351 --> 01:48:32,585
在现代塔特 我和我老婆碰见过她
At the tate Modern. My wife and l ran into her.

1651
01:48:32,651 --> 01:48:35,085
很久以前的事了
But that was a long time ago.

1652
01:48:36,918 --> 01:48:38,585
那之后你有没有见过她
Have you seen her since?

1653
01:48:38,985 --> 01:48:40,785
好象没有
Not that l recall.

1654
01:48:43,519 --> 01:48:45,186
你有没有
Have...?

1655
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:47,820
你有没有见过这个
Have you ever seen this?

1656
01:48:48,786 --> 01:48:50,786
没有，是什么
No. What is it?

1657
01:48:52,087 --> 01:48:54,687
你知道诺拉·赖斯一直在写日记吗
Are you aware that Nola Rice kept a diary?

1658
01:49:04,221 --> 01:49:05,855
不知道
No.

1659
01:49:06,888 --> 01:49:08,855
你看的到
As you can see...

1660
01:49:09,488 --> 01:49:11,889
写的全是你
...you're all over it.

1661
01:49:19,123 --> 01:49:21,490
是的，我看见了
Yes, l can see that.

1662
01:49:24,723 --> 01:49:26,923
你现在还坚称
Do you still claim that you haven't seen her,

1663
01:49:26,990 --> 01:49:29,524
一年前在现代塔特见过她后 就再没见过她了吗
except for more than a year ago at the tate Modern?

1664
01:49:32,557 --> 01:49:36,124
你不能怪我隐瞒 我和她交往的事
You can't blame me for trying to hide the fact that l had an affair with her.

1665
01:49:36,791 --> 01:49:39,125
而且你们也应该保护我的隐私
But you people have to protect me here.

1666
01:49:40,058 --> 01:49:42,858
我希望你不要 把我和她的谋杀案扯上关系
l hope you don't think l had anything to do with her murder.

1667
01:49:42,925 --> 01:49:44,892
你和她交往多久了
How long did your affair go on?

1668
01:49:50,126 --> 01:49:53,026
一次偶然的机会 在她还没和汤姆分开的时候
lt began casually when she was still engaged to tom.

1669
01:49:53,793 --> 01:49:55,960
他们分手后 她搬走了
they broke up, she moved away.

1670
01:49:57,026 --> 01:50:00,793
她回来后，我在现代塔特碰巧遇见她 然后我们又开始了
She came back and l ran into her at the tate Modern, and it began again.

1671
01:50:03,227 --> 01:50:05,227
请帮我保密
God, have a heart.

1672
01:50:05,994 --> 01:50:08,394
我妻子就要生小孩了
My wife is gonna have a baby.

1673
01:50:08,661 --> 01:50:10,928
她受不了这个的
this will devastate her.

1674
01:50:12,095 --> 01:50:13,528
你有
Did you...

1675
01:50:13,895 --> 01:50:17,795
答应过离开你的妻子而和 赖斯小姐结婚吗
...promise that you were going to leave your wife and marry Miss Rice?

1676
01:50:18,162 --> 01:50:20,229
不，没有
No, l did not.

1677
01:50:20,629 --> 01:50:22,962
也许她有那方面的幻想
l mean, it's possible she had that fantasy.

1678
01:50:23,929 --> 01:50:27,229
很明显，她上面写到了
And, obviously, she wrote that l did.

1679
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:35,364
但我没有那样承诺过她
But l tried to finesse that point with her.

1680
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:37,697
我不想和她结束性欲的关系
l didn't want the sexual relationship to end,

1681
01:50:37,764 --> 01:50:39,831
但我也不想破坏自己的家庭
but l'm not gonna break up my home.

1682
01:50:41,564 --> 01:50:44,498
我和我妻子好不容易才有个孩子
My wife and l are trying very hard to have a baby.

1683
01:50:44,565 --> 01:50:48,232
我们看了很多医生
We've seen several fertility doctors, et cetera.

1684
01:50:49,332 --> 01:50:52,932
你们可以去查查 但请你帮我保密
You can check that out if you like, but l beg you to be discreet.

1685
01:50:53,032 --> 01:50:55,032
但你误导了她
But you did lead her on,

1686
01:50:55,132 --> 01:50:57,933
她以为你在家里并不开心
so that she had the impression you were unhappy at home.

1687
01:50:58,599 --> 01:51:00,899
我试过不误导她
l tried to tip toe around it and not lead her on,

1688
01:51:00,966 --> 01:51:03,733
但她只相信她想相信的
but she's going to believe what she wants to believe.

1689
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:10,034
请你们不要胡乱调查 以免破坏了别人的生活
Look, don't irresponsibly run roughshod over this and wreck people's lives.

1690
01:51:10,667 --> 01:51:13,534
我是说这案子和我没关系 因为我从不会伤害其他人
l mean, there is no case because l would not harm anyone,

1691
01:51:13,601 --> 01:51:15,701
诺拉·赖斯就更不会了
much less Nola Rice.

1692
01:51:21,035 --> 01:51:23,935
难道还不明显吗 有人杀了她的邻居
lsn't it obvious that somebody killed her neighbor,

1693
01:51:24,002 --> 01:51:26,035
她走进来时刚好看到
and she walked in when it was happening?

1694
01:51:27,936 --> 01:51:31,436
我请求你们 请别再调查我和她的事了
God, l beg you, don't go on a fishing expedition over this and...

1695
01:51:31,869 --> 01:51:33,836
因为你们正在破坏别人的生活
...wreck people's lives.

1696
01:51:33,936 --> 01:51:37,036
我的家庭, 我的婚姻危如累卵
My family, my marriage is at stake.

1697
01:51:38,103 --> 01:51:40,737
我们只是想查清楚这次谋杀案中 所发生的事
We just have to check out everything in a murder case.

1698
01:51:40,803 --> 01:51:43,204
那没问题 但我不是凶手
Ok, but l'm not your man.

1699
01:51:43,704 --> 01:51:46,937
我知道欺骗自己的妻子 是件不光彩的事
l know it's not the most honorable thing to cheat on your wife,

1700
01:51:47,004 --> 01:51:49,238
但并不说明我就是凶手
but that does not make me a murderer.

1701
01:51:49,404 --> 01:51:52,338
我们只是想查清楚案发过程
We're... obligated to review the situation.

1702
01:51:52,405 --> 01:51:54,405
我知道你对这事很敏感
l understand it's sensitive stuff for you.

1703
01:51:54,472 --> 01:51:56,072
但如果我们还要找你谈话的话
And if we have to talk to you again,

1704
01:51:56,138 --> 01:51:58,472
我们会尽量保密的
we'll do everything in our power to keep it very private.

1705
01:51:58,539 --> 01:52:00,072
你的私生活怎样是你自己的事
Your personal life's your own.

1706
01:52:00,139 --> 01:52:04,006
我们不做道德审判 只是调查案件而已
We're not making any moral judgments, just investigating a crime.

1707
01:52:14,207 --> 01:52:16,307
我能理解
l understand.

1708
01:52:17,207 --> 01:52:18,874
这样吧
Look...

1709
01:52:18,941 --> 01:52:21,141
如果你们还要找我谈话
...if you have to get in contact with me again,

1710
01:52:21,208 --> 01:52:23,208
虽然我希望不会了
which, God in heaven, l hope you don't,

1711
01:52:23,274 --> 01:52:25,241
请打我的手机
please call me on my mobile.

1712
01:52:25,675 --> 01:52:27,741
这是我的手机号
this is my number.

1713
01:52:29,608 --> 01:52:31,209
谢谢
thanks.

1714
01:52:31,909 --> 01:52:32,909
还有一件事
One other thing.

1715
01:52:32,975 --> 01:52:35,376
你拥有或有权利使用猎枪吗
Do you own or have access to a shotgun?

1716
01:52:37,542 --> 01:52:39,009
我?
Me?

1717
01:52:39,209 --> 01:52:40,409
没有
No.

1718
01:52:40,509 --> 01:52:44,376
我的岳父有, 我没有
My father in law shoots on the estate, but not me.

1719
01:52:44,443 --> 01:52:46,610
你们可以去查，但
You can check it out, but...

1720
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:51,544
我请求你们顾及我和他的立场
...l beg you to consider mine and his position.

1721
01:52:51,644 --> 01:52:53,744
当然
Of course.

1722
01:52:56,711 --> 01:52:58,711
谢谢你
thank you.

1723
01:53:07,312 --> 01:53:09,312
你怎么看
So, what do you think?

1724
01:53:09,846 --> 01:53:11,646
我觉得就是他说的那样
l think it's what it looks like.

1725
01:53:11,713 --> 01:53:13,779
有人抢劫并杀了艾斯比夫人
Someone robbed and killed Mrs. Eastby,

1726
01:53:13,846 --> 01:53:17,413
惊惶逃跑时杀了诺拉·赖斯
who was surprised leaving, and killed Nola Rice.

1727
01:53:18,447 --> 01:53:22,014
我知道，我知道 上面写的是瘾君子做的案
Yeah, l know. l know, it's got drug robbery written all over it.

1728
01:53:22,114 --> 01:53:24,080
他就要做父亲了
He's 'specting a baby.

1729
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:26,714
好吧，虽然她对妻子不怎么忠诚
Ok, he's not gonna win a medal for fidelity, but...

1730
01:53:27,848 --> 01:53:29,481
但我们可以去查查
...we can find out discreetly enough

1731
01:53:29,548 --> 01:53:32,548
休伊特家是否有有关联的猎枪
whether the Hewetts had a shotgun unaccounted for.

1732
01:53:34,415 --> 01:53:38,482
我不认为他会偷自家的枪
l don't think that he would know the first thing about stealing one though,

1733
01:53:38,549 --> 01:53:41,382
再把它锯短
never mind sawing one off.

1734
01:53:42,182 --> 01:53:45,183
这不太可能 他没有前科
lt's a bit of a stretch. He's got no previous convictions.

1735
01:53:45,249 --> 01:53:46,983
甚至没有拿过超速驾驶的告票
Not even a speeding ticket.

1736
01:53:47,049 --> 01:53:49,850
验尸官说艾斯比先被杀
the coroner says that Eastby was killed first.

1737
01:53:49,916 --> 01:53:52,250
 是的 没有争斗的痕迹
Yeah. there's no sign of a forced entry.

1738
01:53:52,317 --> 01:53:54,550
所以艾斯比太太认识凶手 才让他进门的
So Mrs. Eastby knew the killer, if she let him in.

1739
01:53:54,650 --> 01:53:56,117
得了吧，迈克
Well, come on, Mike.

1740
01:53:56,217 --> 01:53:58,017
我们侦破的九成案件
Ninety percent of the crimes we go out on,

1741
01:53:58,117 --> 01:54:00,251
都是受害人自己让罪犯进门的
people open their doors and invite the criminals in.

1742
01:54:00,351 --> 01:54:02,651
我知道，你说的没错 我只是想不明白
Yeah, l know, you're right. l'm just thinking out loud.

1743
01:54:02,718 --> 01:54:05,685
 他有真正的动机 也许
lt's just he's got a real motive. Yeah, maybe.

1744
01:54:05,785 --> 01:54:10,385
但你我都知道 有动机并不说明什么
But a motive, as you and l both painfully know, is not a case.

1745
01:54:10,452 --> 01:54:13,485
我只是对赖斯谋杀案有不同的看法
l'm torn because the Rice murder was clearly an afterthought,

1746
01:54:13,552 --> 01:54:15,419
我还想再深入调查一下
but l'd love to pursue it a little more.

1747
01:54:15,486 --> 01:54:18,853
但不想引起任何人的麻烦
But l'm reluctant to fish around and cause problems for everybody.

1748
01:54:18,919 --> 01:54:21,220
好吧，如果有新线索 我们再跟进吧
Well, if something develops, we can pursue it.

1749
01:54:21,286 --> 01:54:24,020
我怀疑到头来还是那个结果
l doubt anything's gonna drop into our laps.

1750
01:56:21,765 --> 01:56:23,432
克里斯
Ohris.

1751
01:56:33,433 --> 01:56:35,166
诺拉
Nola...

1752
01:56:37,233 --> 01:56:39,500
下这个决定并不好受
...it wasn't easy.

1753
01:56:40,467 --> 01:56:43,234
但当时机出现的时候 我扣了扳机
But when the time came, l could pull the trigger.

1754
01:56:45,134 --> 01:56:48,134
不到危急关头 你不会知道谁是你真正的朋友
You never know who your neighbors are till there's a crisis.

1755
01:56:49,734 --> 01:56:53,935
你要学着把罪恶感埋在心里 继续生活下去
You can learn to push the guilt under the rug and... go on.

1756
01:56:55,102 --> 01:56:56,868
必须这样
You have to.

1757
01:56:56,935 --> 01:56:59,469
否则它会吞噬你
Otherwise it overwhelms you.

1758
01:56:59,535 --> 01:57:01,702
那我呢
And what about me?

1759
01:57:01,802 --> 01:57:04,503
我这个做邻居的呢
What about the next door neighbor?

1760
01:57:05,303 --> 01:57:08,270
我和你们的恩怨毫无关系
l had no involvement in this awful affair.

1761
01:57:09,736 --> 01:57:14,637
为什么我这个清白人也要把命搭进去
ls there no problem about me having to die as an innocent bystander?

1762
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:20,971
无辜者的牺牲有时候是 给大局铺路的
the innocent are sometimes slain to make way for a grander scheme.

1763
01:57:23,038 --> 01:57:25,305
你就是个无辜的牺牲者
You were collateral damage.

1764
01:57:25,371 --> 01:57:27,838
诺拉肚里的孩子也是
So was your own child.

1765
01:57:32,072 --> 01:57:34,072
索福克勒斯（希腊悲剧诗人） 说过
Sophocles said:

1766
01:57:35,539 --> 01:57:37,739
"不出生在这个世上...
'to never have been born

1767
01:57:38,373 --> 01:57:40,839
也许是最完美的结果"
may be the greatest boon of all.'

1768
01:57:43,206 --> 01:57:45,540
准备受到报应吧 克里斯
Prepare to pay the price, Ohris.

1769
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:48,607
你做的太差劲了
Your actions were clumsy.

1770
01:57:48,674 --> 01:57:50,374
到处都是漏洞
Full of holes.

1771
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:53,641
人们很容易就可以找到证据
Almost like someone begging to be found out.

1772
01:57:57,141 --> 01:58:00,108
如果我被抓到被判罪了
lt would be fitting if l were apprehended

1773
01:58:00,175 --> 01:58:02,075
也是应该的
and punished.

1774
01:58:03,208 --> 01:58:06,942
说明这世上还有点正义
At least there would be some small sign ofjustice.

1775
01:58:07,009 --> 01:58:09,976
还有点
Some small...

1776
01:58:10,676 --> 01:58:14,109
希望存在的可能
...measure of hope for the possibility of meaning.

1777
01:58:16,543 --> 01:58:19,677
克里斯·维尔顿杀了她们 我梦见他怎么做的了
Ohris Wilton killed them. l see how he did it.

1778
01:58:19,777 --> 01:58:21,544
什么
What?

1779
01:58:22,744 --> 01:58:24,277
就和我们推测的那样
lt's as we speculated

1780
01:58:24,377 --> 01:58:26,777
一切都很精细 但凶手一定是他
and said was too elaborate, but that's what he did.

1781
01:58:26,844 --> 01:58:29,944
她先杀死隔壁的邻居 然后为了毁掉证据
He killed the next door neighbor first to throw us off the scent

1782
01:58:30,011 --> 01:58:31,711
制造了抢劫的假象
and set up the appearance of a robbery.

1783
01:58:31,778 --> 01:58:32,778
他在那里等着
He waited in the hall.

1784
01:58:32,845 --> 01:58:34,745
他知道她会什么时候回来
He knew she'd be back the same time as usual,

1785
01:58:34,812 --> 01:58:38,079
然后他杀了她 弄的像是她遇到了抢劫杀人贩
and he killed her, making it seem like she surprised a burglar running out.

1786
01:58:38,145 --> 01:58:40,279
他设计好了一切 他准时出现在剧院
He planned it all so he could make the theater in time

1787
01:58:40,345 --> 01:58:42,612
以制造他不在场证据
to strengthen his alibi, if one became necessary.

1788
01:58:42,679 --> 01:58:45,213
虽然我还没想通猎枪的问题
Now, l haven't figured out the weapon problem,

1789
01:58:45,279 --> 01:58:46,746
而且还要和陪审团费很多口舌
and l know it's a lot to ask a jury,

1790
01:58:46,813 --> 01:58:49,013
但这都是我做梦时 看到的案件真相
but the correctness of it came to me in my sleep

1791
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:50,846
我要推翻这个案子
and l am going to break this case.

1792
01:58:50,946 --> 01:58:52,747
我讨厌成为传递坏消息的人 迈克
l hate to be the bearer of bad news, Mike.

1793
01:58:52,847 --> 01:58:53,813
什么
What?

1794
01:58:53,913 --> 01:58:55,847
你的梦可不是陪审团现在最感兴趣的
Not that your dream isn't of primary interest to a jury.

1795
01:58:55,914 --> 01:58:57,147
什么坏消息
What's the bad news?

1796
01:58:57,247 --> 01:59:00,147
凌晨4点那个地区又发生了件枪杀案
there was another shooting in the area last night, 4am.

1797
01:59:00,214 --> 01:59:02,948
一个瘾君子被杀了 看上去是毒品交易不怎么顺利
A drug addict killed. Looks like a drug sale turned nasty.

1798
01:59:03,014 --> 01:59:06,248
那又怎样，难道他死前承认 是他杀了那两个女人吗
What, and he confessed to killing two women before he died?

1799
01:59:06,315 --> 01:59:08,015
没有 没必要说
No, he didn't have to.

1800
01:59:08,082 --> 01:59:11,282
但在他的口袋里 找到了老太太的结婚戒指
the old woman's wedding ring was right in his pocket.

1801
01:59:11,949 --> 01:59:15,216
 不可能 戒指上刻有名字和日期
No. Name and date engraved right on it.

1802
01:59:16,182 --> 01:59:19,416
 我不信 我理解，我理解
l don't believe it. l know. l know.

1803
01:59:19,483 --> 01:59:21,783
你调查的很不错 克里斯有很多动机
Your case looked good, lots of motive.

1804
01:59:21,850 --> 01:59:24,116
但他的动机也很明显 就是海洛因
But his motive was pretty strong too. Heroin.

1805
01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:26,817
那个瘾君子有一大堆前科
Junkie with a long string of convictions.

1806
01:59:27,417 --> 01:59:29,450
毫无疑问 他被黑吃黑了
killed by one of his own, no doubt.

1807
01:59:29,550 --> 01:59:31,351
走吧 我请你吃早餐
Oome on, l'll buy you breakfast.

1808
01:59:31,451 --> 01:59:33,784
你可以继续说说你的梦
You can traumatize me with the rest of your dreams.

1809
01:59:33,851 --> 01:59:35,251
不，等等
No, wait.

1810
01:59:35,318 --> 01:59:39,285
如果是维尔顿干的 事后他把珠宝扔了，而那个人捡到了呢
What if Wilton did it, threw the jewels away, this guy finds them?

1811
01:59:40,718 --> 01:59:44,085
我不知道 看看今晚你能梦见些什么吧
l don't know. See what tonight's dream tells you.

1812
01:59:44,152 --> 01:59:46,885
我想陪审团一定会感兴趣的
l'm sure a jury will be interested.

1813
01:59:46,952 --> 01:59:48,819
走吧
Oome on.

1814
01:59:50,152 --> 01:59:51,419
我放弃了
l give up.

1815
01:59:51,486 --> 01:59:53,286
我知道不是维尔顿干的
l knew Wilton didn't do it.

1816
01:59:53,353 --> 01:59:55,686
他只是个欺骗老婆的可怜虫
He's another poor schmuck who cheated on his wife.

1817
01:59:55,753 --> 01:59:59,087
当你看了诺拉·赖斯的照片后 你就知道为什么了
When you see those pictures of Nola Rice, you can see why though.

1818
01:59:59,787 --> 02:00:02,554
什么世界啊，是吧
What a world. Am l right?

1819
02:00:03,020 --> 02:00:06,021
小心，小心 我老是怕这些会掉下来
Oareful, careful. l'm always afraid they'll drop.

1820
02:00:06,121 --> 02:00:09,088
 别杞人忧天了，爸爸 婴儿太..柔软了
Oh, chill out, Dad. Babies are so, so soft.

1821
02:00:09,188 --> 02:00:11,121
对了，香槟
Right. Ohampagne.

1822
02:00:11,188 --> 02:00:13,421
 他的眼睛像你，克洛伊 是吗
l think he's got your eyes, Ohloe. Really?

1823
02:00:13,488 --> 02:00:15,855
我觉得他和你好像 真的
l think he's got your coloring darling, l really do.

1824
02:00:15,922 --> 02:00:19,189
妈咪，现在说不准的 他长的时候会变的
Mummy, you can't tell anything yet. they change all the time.

1825
02:00:20,522 --> 02:00:22,089
 我的外甥 汤姆，汤姆舅舅
My nephew. Uncle, Uncle tom.

1826
02:00:22,156 --> 02:00:24,823
 哦，这些花好漂亮 天啊，他看起来很像克里斯多佛
Oh, look at these flowers. No, he does look like Ohristopher.

1827
02:00:24,889 --> 02:00:28,390
事实上，说起那个 你有没有得到艾伦·辛克莱的职位
Actually, speaking of which, didn't you move into Alan Sinclair's old office?

1828
02:00:28,456 --> 02:00:30,823
 狗屎运 妈妈，他在做梦耶
