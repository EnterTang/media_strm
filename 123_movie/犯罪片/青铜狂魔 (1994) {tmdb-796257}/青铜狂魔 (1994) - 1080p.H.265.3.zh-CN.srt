1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,300
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,140
In this segment we'll briefly described
the latest video

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,960
compression standards, the high efficiency
video coding standard, HGVC.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,100
It's a result of the effort by the joint
collaborative

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,393
team on video coding and it is therefore
additional names.

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:25,470
It's called H.265 by ITU-T, and MPEG-H
part two by MPEG.

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,380
As computers become more powerful, more
involved ideas from

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,160
the literature, or new ideas can be
implemented and tested.

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,716
So the old idea of breaking a frame

10
00:00:38,716 --> 00:00:42,392
into blocks of various sizes using a
[INAUDIBLE] structure.

11
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:45,152
To perform motion estimation and
compensation

12
00:00:45,152 --> 00:00:47,185
can now become part of a standard.

13
00:00:47,185 --> 00:00:50,360
Since adequate computational resources are
available.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,030
Similarly, instead of the eight spatial
prediction

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,467
modes used in H.264 33 plus 235.

16
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:05,042
Such prediction modes can be implemented
in H.265.

17
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:09,712
The overall result is that the latest
standard is a very powerful one.

18
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:12,280
Especially for large spatial resolutions.

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,429
As a matter of fact, it supports

20
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:21,050
resolution up to 8k UHD, ultra high
definition.

21
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,080
It's really fascinating to watch the

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,810
progress the video compression standards
are making.

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,844
They bring of course up the important
question of

24
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:33,793
how much longer can we be push in the
envelope.

25
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,349
By having the rate of the previous
standard

26
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:39,899
while maintaining the quality of the
constructed video.

27
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,180
Maybe some of you might be the ones to
further push this envelope.

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,550
So let us look into some of the details of
this exciting standard.

29
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,110
High efficiency video coding standard is
the latest standard

30
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,180
out of the Joint Collaborative Team on
Video Coding.

31
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,382
That initial objective can be to reduce
the bit rate by 50%

32
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:12,640
of the same quality when compared to H.264
High Profile.

33
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,894
Since it's a joint def it has various
names; in ITU is referred

34
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:25,190
to as an H.265 or an H Next Generation
Video Coding.

35
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:32,050
Whereby the ISO is referred to as MPEG-H
Part 2.

36
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,810
In comparing HEVC to H.264 it provides in
practice better

37
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,610
coding efficiency by more than 35% at the
same quality level.

38
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:51,880
It supports resolutions up to 8K UHD while
H.264 supporting resolutions up to 4K UHD.

39
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,090
It also supports stereo and multi-view
video encoding and also it

40
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,690
supports increased use of parallel
processing, as we are going to see.

41
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:14,420
One of the novelties of ATVC is the use of
coding tree units and coding tree blocks.

42
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,790
The CTU contains the lumen and chromacity
B as well as syntax element.

43
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,020
So this is a departure from the standard
16 by 16 microblock used by all standards.

44
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:34,070
Of course, we saw that H.264 subdivides
this microblock into various sizes.

45
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,410
This CTU however can be as large as 64 by
64 pixels.

46
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,930
And therefore, it's suitable for encoding
high

47
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,130
definition content and results in better
coding efficiency.

48
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,826
The CTU is subdivided into coding blocks,
which can be

49
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:58,495
as small as four by four, based on their
[UNKNOWN] structure.

50
00:03:58,495 --> 00:04:02,450
And of course some rate control logic.

51
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,889
What we see in this table is how the CTU
maximum size affects

52
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:13,750
the bit rate, the encoding time and the
decoding time.

53
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,789
So when the largest possible CTU is used,
we are saving bits.

54
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:22,218
Because there are many more choices in sub
dividing

55
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:26,445
the CTU and adopting to the content of the
frame.

56
00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:34,052
So with the smaller CTU sizes the bit rate
increased by 2.2 here and 11%.

57
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:36,262
If we consider the smaller one, which is

58
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:39,122
concise with the standard size of the
macro blocks.

59
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:42,304
The encoding time however is higher here,
because

60
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:45,330
again there are more choices to be made.

61
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,815
The decoding time however is smaller than
the other choices of the CTU's.

62
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:54,300
Because there are larger now blocks and
not so many blocks to be decoded.

63
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:02,520
The idea of course of using a quad-32
segment or tesselate the frame is not new.

64
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Here's an old result and we see here the
segmentation for this particular frame.

65
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,480
And those are the associated motion
vectors for each of these specific blocks.

66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,958
The actually segmentation as well as the
bit allocation

67
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,050
was done in the [UNKNOWN] in this
particular work.

68
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,250
Behind the segmentation I showed you the
previous frame, there's

69
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,330
this multilevel trellis that one hand
shows the [UNKNOWN] structure.

70
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,415
So a 32 by 32 block is potentially broken
down into

71
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:41,870
four 16 by 16, 16 by 16 and four 8 by 8
and so on.

72
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,020
But this Trellis also allows us to perform
optimal

73
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,600
bit relocation for encoding the
segmentation, the motion vectors.

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,660
As well as the texture so that the overall

75
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,210
performance is optimized or the overall
distortion is minimized.

76
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,068
We see here the coding three unit idea
being demonstrated.

77
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:10,596
Based on this segmentation or tessellation
of the

78
00:06:10,596 --> 00:06:13,744
space or the coding decisions will be
made.

79
00:06:13,744 --> 00:06:16,400
How the bits will be allocated again,

80
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,850
amongst segmentation, motion vectors, as
well as texture.

81
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,010
Here's an example showing that the
tessellation of this

82
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,720
frame from the Foreman sequence by H.264
and H.265.

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,320
Clearly seems many more choices available

84
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,498
with H.265, their coding efficiency only
increases.

85
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:46,258
So here we see that there are large blocks
64 by

86
00:06:46,258 --> 00:06:52,046
64, smaller ones all the way down to 4 by
4.

87
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:55,701
Their choices again are not as many when
we work with

88
00:06:55,701 --> 00:07:01,360
H.264 we talked about the various choices
in the previous presentation.

89
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,992
When it comes to motion estimation and
compensation,

90
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:11,346
quarter sample precision is used for
motion estimation.

91
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:15,816
And this was the case also with H.264.

92
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:23,483
H.265 however uses 7-tap or 8-tap filters
for this fractional sample interpolation.

93
00:07:23,483 --> 00:07:30,032
While H.264 uses a 6-tap filter to go to
half-sample precision

94
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:36,069
and then linear interpolation for quarter
[UNKNOWN] precision.

95
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,610
Regarding motion vector signaling.

96
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,300
An advanced motion vector prediction
scheme is used.

97
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,850
According to which candidate motion
vectors

98
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,510
have derived from neighbouring prediction
blocks.

99
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,500
In addition there's the option to merge or

100
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,880
inherit motion vectors from the temporal
or spatial neighbors.

101
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,880
And this compared to HW64 then it's an
improved skip or direct motion mode.

102
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:12,937
As far as interprediction goes AW65s
supports 33 different directional modes.

103
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:16,826
As compared to the eight ones that are
supported by AW64.

104
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:21,721
And this directional modes applied,
they're applied to blocks

105
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:24,649
from 44 or the way up to 32 by 32.

106
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:29,220
In addition, there is the planar mode
prediction.

107
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,230
And it's done by assuming an object
service with the

108
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,580
horizontal and vertical slope that is
derived from the boundaries.

109
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,960
And finally there's another mode, the DC
prediction or flat mode prediction.

110
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,490
According to which a flat surface with a
value

111
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,280
matching the min value of the boundary
samples is utilized.

112
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:59,380
We see here a pictorially the 33
prediction directions, and direction

113
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,850
zero is the planar prediction and one the
DC prediction we just mentioned.

114
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,860
It should be noted here that all these
directions are

115
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,110
not equally spaced and some directions are
more popular than others.

116
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,800
So we see here schematically that
intra-prediction by the direction

117
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,620
of mode 29 as goes numbered in the
previous slide.

118
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,812
When using this intra-angular mode each
block is

119
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:32,472
predicted directionally from spatially

120
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:35,703
neighbouring samples that are
reconstructed.

121
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:39,340
But not get filtered by the in loop
filters.

122
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,380
For a block N by N, a total of four N

123
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,280
plus one spatially neighbouring samples
may be used for this prediction.

124
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,812
When it comes to entropy coding a CABAC
encoder, context adapting binary

125
00:09:54,812 --> 00:10:00,380
arithmetic code that is used to in, in 265
as is the with 264.

126
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,572
The one H.265; however, has undergone

127
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:07,660
several improvements to improve its
throughput speed.

128
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,514
Especially when its used for parallel
processing, its

129
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:16,764
compression performance and to reduce its
context memory requirements.

130
00:10:16,764 --> 00:10:22,476
And in 265 no variable length codes are
used as opposed

131
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:28,080
to [INAUDIBLE] and variable length coding
in H.264.

132
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,870
With respect to the in-loop filters.

133
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,040
They're used in the inter-picture
prediction loop.

134
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,590
It's similar to the one used in H.264
however it's simpler

135
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:45,820
than the one used in 264 and it better
supports parallel processing.

136
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:53,330
And also a different filter, this sample
adaptive offset filter is used.

137
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,190
It's applied after the deblocking filter
so that a better reconstruction

138
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:02,750
of original signal amplitude by using an
offset from a look-up table.

139
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,490
HEVC supports slices and tiles.

140
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,750
Slices are rows of CTUs, as shown here.

141
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,170
This is an example of a slice.

142
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,923
And as mentioned multiple times during
this

143
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:25,208
week, slices are needed for terminating
error propagation.

144
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:29,254
Since they're independently decoded,
decodable.

145
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:34,564
In addition to slices, HDVC supports
tiles.

146
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:37,504
And tiles are self-contained and
independently

147
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:40,590
recordable rectangular regions in the
pictures.

148
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:48,010
So this is one tile here, this is another
tile and so on.

149
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,350
The main purpose of tiles is to enable

150
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,150
the use of parallel processing for
encoding and decoding.

151
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,840
Now the slice is divided into rows of
CTU's.

152
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,650
So the decoding of each row can begin as
soon as some, the decisions are made.

153
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,330
And therefore this supports parallel
processing in

154
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,650
the form of threads as shown here.

155
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,970
So all this threads can be processed at
the same time.

156
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,060
So there are two different mechanisms,

157
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,580
if you will, that support parallel
processing.

158
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,410
The use of tiles and the use of threads.

159
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,120
We show here an experiment of comparison,
of some of the more recent standards.

160
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,504
So HDVC is compared against 264, 263,
MPEG-4, and MPEG-2.

161
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:48,090
So the rate distortion curves are shown
here for this particular sequence.

162
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,322
So, the bitrate is down here, from 0 to 10
megabits

163
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:57,699
per second, and the PSNR improvement is
shown on the vertical axis.

164
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,886
So as expected you see kind of

165
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:04,720
the chronology of a development of these
standards.

166
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,836
The older standard has a registration
curve shown here and

167
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:13,280
the newest one has the registration curve
shown here in blue.

168
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,846
So there are considerably savings involved
as the newer standards

169
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:25,660
arrive and the savings are shown on the
plot here on the right.

170
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,400
So what's shown here, is the bitrate
savings with respect to HEVC.

171
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,920
And we say that with respect to the

172
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:40,060
older standards, there's savings anywhere
between 85% and 70%.

173
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:48,570
Y with respect to AW64 the savings range
from 55% to around 40% down here.

174
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,410
So in

175
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,880
some sense, we can, we have come to full
circle.

176
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,710
If you recall at the very beginning of
this week's lecture.

177
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,365
I show the similar rate distortion
comparison with

178
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:07,970
some of the earlier standards with also
smaller sequences.

179
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,376
We use their format, a QCIF image.

180
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:17,046
At frame rate I believe it was ten frames
per second.

181
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:21,500
Nevertheless the philosophical question
still remains.

182
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,560
As time goes on these curves keep being
pushed this direction

183
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,940
and we see here that there's not that much
space left.

184
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,196
So the obvious question is will there then
be

185
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:39,485
a next standard that can push the envelope
even further.

186
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:43,900
Or in other words, what is really the
limit of compression?

187
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,430
How far can we compress a given video?

188
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,260
This is a question that we can not really
answer.

189
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,550
We have to wait and see.

190
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,700
You know for the reduction of the bit rate
is going

191
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,100
to be with the new standard while keeping
the same quality.

192
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,690
Of course, the objectives change as well.

193
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,850
We have the proliferation of large
displays and

194
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,330
large formats the 4K and And 8K formats.

195
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:20,800
And clearly, we need new tools and new
approaches to handle these larger formats.

196
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,670
At the same time, the computational speed

197
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,180
and capabilities increase tremendously as
time goes on.

198
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,400
And it's only natural that more
sophisticated

199
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,680
algorithms will be able to be implemented.

200
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,150
That will of course provide the additional
gains that are needed.

201
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,610
So we reached the end of week ten, two
more weeks to go.

202
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,520
During this week the third week out of
three

203
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,200
dedicated to compression we talked about
[UNKNOWN] video compression.

204
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,320
This is probably the most important topic
from an application point

205
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,130
of view since we are surrounded by
application used in video compression.

206
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,790
This is also reflected by the large number
of video compression standards.

207
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,460
We discussed and analyzed the important
topics and covered

208
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,340
some of the intellectually interesting and
practically useful techniques.

209
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,380
We talked about the important concept of
temporal prediction

210
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,280
and also of the concept of intra and inter
prediction.

211
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,310
We described the evolution in video
cooperation standards which represents

212
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,960
a history of the research and development
in this area.

213
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,100
I repeat here a comment I made last week,
that

214
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,555
is, there was nothing really terribly
mathematical in this part.

215
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:39,430
So I hope everybody feels comfortable with
this material.

216
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,330
You're now knowledgable to also follow the
future development in this exciting film.

217
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,130
Next week we'll talk about a different
topic.

218
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,930
The topic of image and video segmentation.

219
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,510
So, see you next week.
