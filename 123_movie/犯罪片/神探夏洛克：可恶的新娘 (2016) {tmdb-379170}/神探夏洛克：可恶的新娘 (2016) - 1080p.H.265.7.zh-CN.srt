00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:23,989
他就是勒索界的拿破仑
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.

146
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:27,156
你这次当不成英雄了  福尔摩斯先生
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.

147
00:01:27,156 --> 00:01:29,729
我是高智商反社会人格
I'm a high-functioning sociopath!

148
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,239
不论我们把夏洛克关在哪
There is no prison in which we could incarcerate Sherlock

149
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,947
他都会每天制造暴乱
without causing a riot on a daily basis.

150
00:01:35,947 --> 00:01:39,333
而另一个办法  则需要你的获准
The alternative, however, would require your approval.

151
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,593
敬那些美好的时光  约翰
To the very best of times, John.

152
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,145
想我了吗
Did you miss me?

153
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:45,312
想我了吗
Did you miss me?

154
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:46,406
这怎么可能
How is this possible?

155
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,781
流放感觉如何
How is the exile going?

156
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:49,166
我才走了四分钟
I've only been gone four minutes.

157
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:51,458
希望你吸取教训了
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.

158
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,781
这次又是谁需要我
Who needs me this time?

159
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:53,937
想我了吗
Miss me?

160
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,041
英国需要你
England.

161
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:12,427
第二次阿富汗大战令很多人载誉而归  加官进爵
"The Second Afghan War brought honours and promotion to many.

162
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:19,145
但对我而言  这无疑是一场彻头彻尾的灾难
"But, for me, it meant nothing but misfortune and disaster."

163
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:32,687
好了  上尉
All right, Captain.

164
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,677
我重返英国  身体落下了终身的伤痛
"I returned to England with my health irretrievably ruined

165
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:48,364
前途一片黯淡
"and my future bleak.

166
00:02:48,572 --> 00:02:52,760
鉴于此  我自然搬来了伦敦
"Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London.

167
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:55,979
这是众多游手好闲者
"That great cesspool into which all the loungers..."

168
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:58,718
-华生  -及闲散人士的游走之所
- Watson! - "..and idlers of the empire are drained."

169
00:02:58,718 --> 00:02:59,875
华生
Watson!

170
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:02,354
我是史丹佛
Stamford.

171
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:03,718
还记得我吗
Remember?

172
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,802
我们以前一起在巴茨医院共事
We were at Barts together.

173
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:09,677
当然记得  史丹佛
Yes, of course. Stamford.

174
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:11,979
老天爷  你这是跑哪混去了
Good Lord! Where have you been?

175
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:13,760
搞得骨瘦如柴的
You're as thin as a rake!

176
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:18,500
我起码活着回来了  许多人还没这个福气
I made it home. Many weren't so lucky.

177
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,708
那现在呢
So what now?

178
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:22,604
我得找个住处落脚
I need a place to live.

179
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:26,552
条件好  价格优  这种地方可不好找
Somewhere decent at an affordable price. It's not easy.

180
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:31,291
今天还有个人和我这么说过
You know, you're the second person to say that to me today.

181
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:33,270
是谁
Who was the first?

182
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:41,552
老天爷
Good Lord.

183
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,625
据说是个实验
It's an experiment, apparently.

184
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:49,635
鞭笞尸体  以确立在死亡后多久
Beating corpses to establish how long after death

185
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:51,812
人体仍能形成瘀伤
bruising is still possible.

186
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,177
这有何医学意义吗
Is there a medical point to that?

187
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:56,958
我不确定
Not sure.

188
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:01,843
我也不确定  你所说的那位朋友呢
Neither am I. So, where's this friend of yours, then?

189
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:10,656
不好意思
Excuse me.

190
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:15,416
但愿我们没打扰到你
I do hope we're not interrupting.

191
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:23,322
你应该去过阿富汗吧
You've been in Afghanistan, I perceive.

192
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:25,614
华生医生  这位是夏洛克先生
Dr Watson, Mr Sherlock...

193
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:28,468
反应敏捷  你是个合适人选
Excellent reflexes, you'll do.

194
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:29,781
你说什么
I'm sorry...?

195
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:31,635
我看上了摄政公园附近的一套房子
I have my eye on a suite of rooms near Regent's Park.

196
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:33,177
我们一起应该能付得起房租
Between us we could afford them.

197
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:35,125
房子  谁说过房子的事情了
Rooms? Who said anything about rooms?

198
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,364
是我  我今早跟史丹佛提过
I did, I mentioned it to Stamford this morning,

199
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:37,593
我需要一位合租者
I was in need of a fellow lodger.

200
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:38,645
而他在午饭后
Now he appears after lunch

201
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,479
便带来了一位军人模样的男子
in the company of a man of military aspect

202
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,770
皮肤黝黑  最近受过伤
with a tan and a recent injury,

203
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,135
这两个特点都暗示了你参加过阿富汗战争
both suggestive of the campaign in Afghanistan

204
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:45,708
并被迫离开了战场
and an enforced departure from it.

205
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,729
这似乎是个必然的结论
The conclusion seemed inescapable.

206
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:50,385
我们明晚再敲定细节
We'll finalise the details tomorrow evening.

207
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:51,250
失陪了
Now, if you'll excuse me,

208
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,479
旺兹沃思有一场绞刑
I have a hanging in Wandsworth

209
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,552
我可不想错过
and I'd hate them to start without me.

210
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:57,604
-绞刑  -这属于我的职业范畴
- A hanging? - I take a professional interest.

211
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:00,364
我还拉小提琴  抽烟斗
I also play the violin and smoke a pipe.

212
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:01,833
这应该不成问题吧
I presume that's not a problem.

213
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,697
是的
Er, no, well...

214
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:05,604
你显然习惯了从来不把话说完
And you're clearly acclimatized to never getting to the end of a sentence.

215
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,135
我们会相处得非常愉快
We'll get along splendidly.

216
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,489
那就约好明晚七点
Tomorrow evening, seven o'clock, then.

217
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,416
对了  我叫夏洛克・福尔摩斯
Oh, and the name is Sherlock Holmes

218
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:16,781
地址是贝克街221B
and the address is 221B, Baker Street.

219
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,229
是的  他一直都是这个样子
Yes...he's always been like that.

220
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:03,375
卖报  卖报
Papers! Papers!

221
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:10,479
卖报  卖报
Papers! Papers!

222
00:06:11,197 --> 00:06:13,906
喂  《蓝宝石奇案》卖得怎么样
Here, how's The Blue Carbuncle doing?

223
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,989
非常受欢迎  华生医生
Very popular, Dr Watson.

224
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:18,583
下个月会有正经的谋杀案吗
Is there going to be a proper murder next month?

225
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,416
我会跟罪犯们谈一谈
I'll have a word with the criminal classes.

226
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,895
那就拜托你了
If you wouldn't mind.

227
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,062
那是他吗  他在车里吗
Is that him? Is he in there?

228
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,333
不  不不  车里不是他
No. No, no, not at all.

229
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:29,843
再见
Er, good day to you.

230
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:31,135
走吧
Let on, walk.

231
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:35,052
圣诞快乐  福尔摩斯先生
Merry Christmas, Mr Holmes!

232
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,541
福尔摩斯先生
Mr Holmes!

233
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:59,208
我希望你打算回家之前能跟我打声招呼
I do wish you'd let me know when you're planning to come home!

234
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,239
连我自己都说不准  赫德森太太
I hardly knew myself, Mrs Hudson.

235
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,989
这就是乡绅分尸案的棘手之处
That's the trouble with dismembered country squires.

236
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:06,145
想提前安排日程真是难如登天
They're notoriously difficult to schedule.

237
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,062
-这里面是什么  -别管了
- What's in there? - Never mind.

238
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:09,187
谢谢
Thank you.

239
00:07:09,437 --> 00:07:11,281
你抓到杀人凶手了吗  福尔摩斯先生
Did you catch the murderer, Mr Holmes?

240
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:13,010
凶手抓到了  但还在找被肢解的腿
Caught the murderer, still looking for the legs.

241
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,468
就算是打了个平手吧
I think we'll call it a draw.

242
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,843
我看到你又发表了一篇故事  华生医生
And I noticed you've published another of your stories, Dr Watson.

243
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:19,468
是的  你喜欢吗
Yes, did you enjoy it?

244
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:20,875
不喜欢
No.

245
00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:25,239
-我一直都不喜欢  -为什么
- I never enjoy them. - Why not?

246
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:28,979
我从来连句台词都没有
Well, I never say anything, do I?

247
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,375
据你所写  我就只负责带人上楼
According to you, I just show people up the stairs

248
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,718
给你们做早餐而已
and serve you breakfasts.

249
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:33,791
在故事当中
Well, within the narrative,

250
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,687
这大致上就是你的职能
that is, broadly speaking, your function.

251
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,031
我的什么
My what?!

252
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:39,635
别觉得受了针对  赫德森太太
Don't feel singled out, Mrs Hudson,

253
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:42,020
-写狗的那篇我都没太露脸  -写狗的那篇
- I'm hardly in the dog one. - "The dog one?"

254
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,968
我是你们的房东  而不是情节设置
I'm your landlady, not a plot device.

255
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:46,520
你是指《巴斯克维尔的猎犬》吗
Do you mean The Hound Of The Baskervilles?

256
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,177
而且你把房子搞得那么沉闷昏暗
And you make the rooms so drab and dingy.

257
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,479
这你得怪插画家  他简直胡来
Oh, blame it on the illustrator, he's out of control!

258
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:54,458
我还得留着八字胡  好让大家能认出我来
I've had to grow this moustache just so people will recognise me.

259
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,083
这些年来  我很荣幸能够记录
"Over the many years it has been my privilege to record

260
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,395
我非凡的朋友夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生的功绩
"the exploits of my remarkable friend, Mr Sherlock Holmes,

261
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:06,822
在其众多的案件中择一呈现给读者
"It has sometimes been difficult to choose which of his many cases

262
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:08,937
有时并非易事
"to set before my readers.

263
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,520
有些过于敏感  不便详述
"Some are still too sensitive to recount,

264
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,760
而有些则尚未淡出公众脑海
"whilst others are too recent in the minds of the public.

265
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:18,708
但在我们共同经历的众多冒险中
"But in all our many adventures together,

266
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,791
还没有哪件案子
no case pushed my friend

267
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,968
像《恐怖新娘》那样
to such mental and physical extremes

268
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:27,614
挑战了我朋友的心理及生理极限
"as that of The Abominable Bride!"

269
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:29,510
老天爷
Good Lord!

270
00:08:30,072 --> 00:08:33,541
赫德森太太  我的客厅里有个女人
Mrs Hudson, there is a woman in my sitting room!

271
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:35,333
这是故意的吗
Is it intentional?

272
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,093
她是客户
She's a client.

273
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:40,135
我说你出去了  她坚持要等
Said you were out, insisted on waiting.

274
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,697
你想坐下吗
Would you, er, care to sit down?

275
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,625
你有没有问她想要什么
Didn't you ask her what she wanted?

276
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,270
你去问她
You ask her!

277
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,062
你为什么不问她
Why didn't you ask her?

278
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:52,614
我怎么问  我又不说话
How could I, what with me not talking and everything?!

279
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,718
老天爷啊  给她点台词
For God's sake, give her some lines,

280
00:08:54,718 --> 00:08:56,729
她完全可以把我们饿死
she's perfectly capable of starving us!

281
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:59,708
下午好  我是夏洛・克福尔摩斯
Good afternoon. I am Sherlock Holmes,

282
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,770
这是我的朋友兼同事  华生医生
this is my friend and colleague, Dr Watson.

283
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:02,822
你可以在他面前畅所欲言
You may speak freely in front of him,

284
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:04,760
-因为他基本听不懂  -福尔摩斯
- as he rarely understands a word. - Holmes!

285
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,562
但在你开口之前
However, before you do,

286
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:07,864
请容我先说一些我小小的观察
allow me to make some trifling observations.

287
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:09,510
你有一种恶作剧般的幽默感
You have an impish sense of humour,

288
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,927
你现在就在以此
which currently you are deploying

289
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,500
减轻你个人的痛苦
to ease a degree of personal anguish.

290
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,718
你最近嫁给了一个
You have recently married a man

291
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:16,875
看起来性格很好的人
of a seemingly kindly disposition,

292
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,979
而他现在因为一个
who has now abandoned you

293
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:21,729
品行有问题的同伴而抛弃了你
for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals.

294
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:24,135
你把来到这里当做最后的手段
You have come to this agency as a last resort,

295
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:26,625
以期你们的关系可以得到调解
in the hope that reconciliation may still be possible.

296
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,177
我的天啊  福尔摩斯
Good Lord, Holmes!

297
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:32,093
当然  所有这些都是从你的香水推测而来
All of this is, of course, perfectly evident from your perfume.

298
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,343
她的香水
Her perfume?

299
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:39,041
对  香水  让我洞悉一切  给你带来灾难
Yes, her perfume, which brings insight to me and disaster to you.

300
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,062
为什么
How so?

301
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:42,343
因为我认出了它
Because I recognised it

302
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:44,197
而你没有
and you did not.

303
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:46,583
-玛丽  -约翰
- Mary! - John.

304
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:50,187
我的天  你为什么要扮成客户
Why, in God's name, are you pretending to be a client?

305
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:54,770
因为我想不出别的办法能见我丈夫  丈夫
Because I could think of no other way to see my husband, husband.

306
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,750
那是个国际阴谋事件
It was an affair of international intrigue.

307
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,750
就是个被谋杀的乡绅
It was a murdered country squire.

308
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,083
虽然如此  但事情紧急
Nevertheless, matters were pressing.

309
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,916
我不介意你走  亲爱的
I don't mind you going, my darling,

310
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,427
-我介意的是你扔下我  -但你能做什么
- I mind you leaving me behind. - But what could you do?!

311
00:10:07,427 --> 00:10:08,520
那你能做什么
Well, what do you do,

312
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,614
除了晃来晃去做笔记  表现得很惊讶
except wander around taking notes, looking surprised?!

313
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:12,593
够了
Enough!

314
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,510
舞台已经准备好  大幕升起
The stage is set, the curtain rises.

315
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:20,072
我们要开始了
We are ready to begin.

316
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:22,437
开始什么
Begin what?

317
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:26,375
有时为了破一个案子  必须先破另一个
Sometimes to solve a case, one must first solve another.

318
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,041
你有案子吗  一个新案子
Oh, you have a case, then, a new one?

319
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,020
一个老案子  非常老
An old one, very old.

320
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:33,697
我必须得深入
I shall have to go deep.

321
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,291
深入什么
Deep? Into what?

322
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:37,156
我自己
Myself.

323
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,260
雷斯垂德  别在门外晃了  进来吧
Lestrade! Do stop loitering by the door and come in.

324
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,739
你怎么知道是我
How did you know it was me?

325
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:47,843
脚步声是不会错的
The regulation tread is unmistakable.

326
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:50,302
比琼斯轻  被格雷格森重
Lighter than Jones, heavier than Gregson.

327
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:54,031
我刚上来  哈德森太太不肯说话
I, I just came up... Mrs Hudson didn't seem to be talking.

328
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:56,666
恐怕她是在用讽刺的方法
I fear she has branched into literary criticism

329
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,145
进行文学批评
by means of satire.

330
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:00,677
这是现代房东烦人的发展趋势
It is a distressing trend in the modern landlady.

331
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:03,541
你为何事在下班时间过来
What brings you here in your off-duty hours?

332
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,833
-你怎么知道我下班了  -从你来之后
- How do you know I'm off duty? - Well, since your arrival,

333
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,250
你超过40%的注意力都在我的酒瓶上
you've addressed over 40% of your remarks to my decanter.

334
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,781
华生  给探长拿点他显然想要的东西
Watson, give the Inspector what he so clearly wants.

335
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:18,312
雷斯垂德  我们能为你做什么
So...Lestrade, what can we do for you?

336
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,718
我不是为公事来的  我只是想过来看看
Oh, I'm not here on business, I just thought I'd drop by.

337
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,802
社交拜访吗
A social call?

338
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:27,510
当然  只是想给你带来节日问候
Yeah, of course, just to wish you the compliments of the season.

339
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:32,468
-圣诞快乐  -圣诞快乐
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

340
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:34,239
-圣诞快乐  -圣诞快乐
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

341
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,010
可算客套完了
Thank God that's over.

342
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,072
说吧  探长  是什么奇怪的事让你来到我家
Now, Inspector, what strange happening compels you to my door,

343
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,968
又让你尴尬得说不出口
but embarrasses you to relate?

344
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:42,010
谁说出事了
Who said anything happened?

345
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,416
你  虽然你没有真正说出来
You did. By every means short of actual speech.

346
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,031
福尔摩斯  你误判了
Holmes, you have misdiagnosed.

347
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:51,989
那纠正我一下  医生
Then, correct me, Doctor.

348
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,395
他不是想要喝一杯  而是需要喝一杯
He didn't want a drink, he needed one.

349
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,260
他不是尴尬  他是害怕
He's not embarrassed, he's afraid.

350
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:06,427
我的传记作者学到了东西  他们进步得真快
My Boswell is learning. They do grow up so fast.

351
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,270
华生  给苏格兰场恢复一下勇气
Watson, restore the courage of Scotland Yard.

352
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:10,843
探长  坐下吧
Inspector, do sit down.

353
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:15,250
我并不是害怕
I'm, I'm not afraid, exactly.

354
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:17,468
恐惧是面对危险时的智慧
Fear is wisdom in the face of danger,

355
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:19,270
这没什么难为情的
it is nothing to be ashamed of.

356
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,656
谢谢
Thank you.

357
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:22,968
从头开始讲吧
From the beginning, then.

358
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,364
你
You!

359
00:12:31,156 --> 00:12:32,666
不要  拜托
No, please!

360
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:42,729
你
You?!

361
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:47,864
等一下
A moment.

362
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:57,125
这是什么时候的事
When was this?

363
00:12:58,427 --> 00:12:59,750
昨天早上
Yesterday morning.

364
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,760
那个新娘的脸  是怎样描述的
The bride's face, how was it described?

365
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:10,562
"像死人一样苍白  嘴像一道绯红的伤口"
"White as death, mouth like a crimson wound."

366
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,083
这是创作还是事实
Poetry or truth?

367
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:18,781
很多人会说它们是一样的
Many would say they're the same thing.

368
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:21,656
对  他们都是白痴  创作还是事实
Yes, idiots. Poetry or truth?

369
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,385
我看到过她的脸  是在后来
I saw her face myself. Afterwards.

370
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,031
什么的后来
After what?

371
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:29,145
你
You?

372
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:33,250
还是我
Or me?

373
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:43,041
不是吧  雷斯垂德  一个女人当众饮弹
Oh, really, Lestrade, a woman blows her own brains out in public

374
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:45,583
而你需要我帮助找出罪犯
and you need help identifying the guilty party?

375
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:48,760
恐怕苏格兰场又刷低了下限
I feel Scotland Yard has reached a new low.

376
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:50,520
那不是我来的原因
That's not why I'm here.

377
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,270
-我猜也是  -她叫什么名字  那个新娘
- I surmised. - What was her name, the bride?

378
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:56,895
艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂  昨天是她的结婚纪念日
Emelia Ricoletti. Yesterday was her wedding anniversary.

379
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:59,333
当然  有人报了警
The police, of course, were called.

380
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:02,708
她的尸体被送到了停尸房
And her body taken to the morgue.

381
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:05,791
这是标准程序  你为什么要告诉我们这些
Standard procedure. Why are you telling us what may be presumed?

382
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:09,354
因为接下来发生的事
Because of what happened next.

383
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:14,791
在莱姆豪斯  就几小时之后
Limehouse. Just a few hours later.

384
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,562
托马斯・瑞克莱蒂  艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂的丈夫
Thomas Ricoletti. Emelia Ricoletti's husband.

385
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:34,385
大概是在去停尸房辨认遗体的路上吧
Presumably on his way to the morgue to identify her remains?

386
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,885
结果他省了这麻烦
As it turned out, he was saved the trip.

387
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:49,583
*别忘了我*
*Do not forget me*

388
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:54,052
*别忘了我*
*Do not forget me*

389
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:57,843
{\an8}*记住那少女*
*Remember the maid...*

390
00:14:57,322 --> 00:14:58,552
你是谁
Who are you?

391
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:02,177
{\an8}*磨坊的少女*
*The maid of the mill...*

392
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,968
你为什么要这样做  告诉我你是谁
Why are you doing this? Just tell me who you are!

393
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,343
你听出了我们的歌吗  亲爱的
You recognise our song, my dear?

394
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:09,427
我在婚礼上唱过
I sang it at our wedding.

395
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:15,625
艾米丽娅
Emelia?

396
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:20,260
你死了  你不可能在这里  你死了
You, you're dead, you can't be here, you died!

397
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:23,114
我美吗  托马斯
Am I not beautiful, Thomas?

398
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,427
跟你娶我那天一样美
As beautiful as the day you married me?

399
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:28,395
-谁...  -这是怎么回事
- Who... - What the hell is all this about?!

400
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:34,041
看起来像是什么样  我英俊的朋友
What does it look like, my handsome friend?

401
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,979
这是"枪杆"下的婚姻
It's a shotgun wedding.

402
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:50,802
不至死亡  永不分离  他们各死了一次
Till death us do part. Twice in this case.

403
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:09,854
真离奇
Extraordinary.

404
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,229
不可能
Impossible.

405
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:13,625
太棒了
Superb.

406
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,500
在街头自杀  被尸体谋杀
Suicide as street theatre, murder by corpse.

407
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,739
雷斯垂德  你简直宠坏我们了
Lestrade, you're spoiling us.

408
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:17,937
华生  你的帽子和外套
Watson, your hat and coat.

409
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:19,145
-我们去哪里  -停尸房
- Where are we going? - To the morgue.

410
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:20,635
一刻也不能耽搁了
There's not a moment to lose,

411
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,322
很少有人会这样说停尸房
which one can so rarely say of a morgue.

412
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,500
那我就坐在这里吗
And am I just to sit here?

413
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,333
当然不是  亲爱的  我们之后会饿的
Not at all, my dear. We'll be hungry later.

414
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,052
福尔摩斯  有个问题  穿花呢衣服去停尸房吗
Holmes, just one thing, tweeds in a morgue?

415
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:32,520
没时间换衣服了  华生
Needs must when the devil drives, Watson.

416
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,916
太太
Ma'am.

417
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,666
我参与了一项活动
I'm part of a campaign, you know.

418
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,052
活动
Oh, campaign?

419
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,791
为女性争取投票权
Votes for women.

420
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,041
你是支持还是反对
And are you for or against?

421
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,666
出去
Get out.

422
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,656
他们又走了  对吧
Have they gone off again, have they?

423
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:09,781
那些绅士过着什么样的生活啊
I don't know, what a life those gentlemen lead.

424
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:12,666
是啊  那些绅士
Yes. Those gentlemen!

425
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:14,604
算了
Never you mind.

426
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:17,500
差点忘了  这是给你的
Almost forgot, that came for you.

427
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,760
赫德森太太  告诉我丈夫我会晚归
Mrs Hudson, tell my husband I'll be home late,

428
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,968
我有些急事
I have some urgent business.

429
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,364
一切还好吧
Is everything all right?

430
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,489
只是一个需要帮助的朋友
Oh, you know, just a, er, friend in need.

431
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,625
天啊  什么朋友
Oh, dear. What friend?

432
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:41,583
英格兰
England.

433
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,687
还真是含糊
Well, that's not very specific.

434
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,677
停尸房谁当班
Who's on mortuary duty?

435
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,979
你知道的
You know who.

436
00:17:54,979 --> 00:17:56,385
总是他
Always him.

437
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,114
拜托告诉我是哪个傻瓜干的
Please tell me which idiot did this!

438
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:11,302
这是为了大家的安全
It's for everyone's safety.

439
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:16,791
这女人死了  她半边头都不见了
This woman is dead, half her head is missing.

440
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,541
她对谁都不是威胁
She's not a threat to anyone.

441
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,687
跟她的丈夫说去吧  他在那边的罩单下
Tell that to her husband, he's under a sheet over there.

442
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:23,072
不管昨晚在莱姆豪斯发生了什么
Whatever happened in Limehouse last night,

443
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:26,322
我们能断定那不是一个死去的女人干的
I think we can safely assume it wasn't the work of a dead woman.

444
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,958
比这更奇怪的事都发生过
Stranger things have happened.

445
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,593
比如呢
Such as...?

446
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:34,072
奇怪的事
Well... Strange things.

447
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,666
你说话跟小孩一样
You're speaking like a child.

448
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,864
这显然是活人干的  他在哪里
This is clearly man's work. Where is he?

449
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:43,656
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

450
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:46,937
霍普
Hooper.

451
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,468
你  继续工作
You, back to work!

452
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:58,375
你是来用魔术震撼我们了吧
So, come to astonish us with your magic tricks, I suppose?

453
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,625
你想提醒我注意什么事吗
Is there anything to which you would like to draw my attention?

454
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,479
完全没有  福尔摩斯先生
Nothing at all, Mr Holmes.

455
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,729
你想什么时候走都行
You may leave any time you like.

456
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:09,291
霍普医生  是我请福尔摩斯先生来的  合作点
Dr Hooper, I asked Mr Holmes to come here. Cooperate.

457
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,562
这是命令
That's an order.

458
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,635
有两点"值得注意"
There are two "Features of interest",

459
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:17,406
正如你在华生医生的故事里经常说的
as you are always saying in Dr Watson's stories.

460
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,541
我从来没说过
I never say that.

461
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,187
你说过  很多次
You do, actually, quite a lot.

462
00:19:22,312 --> 00:19:25,197
首先  这绝对是艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂
First of all, this is definitely Emelia Ricoletti.

463
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,083
她已经被确定身份了
She has been categorically identified.

464
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,322
这肯定是她  无可置疑
Beyond a doubt, it is her.

465
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,343
那昨晚在莱姆豪斯是谁
Then who was that in Limehouse last night?

466
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,458
也是艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂
That was also Emelia Ricoletti.

467
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,989
不可能  她死了  躺在这里
It can't have been. She was dead, she was here.

468
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:37,468
是她自己的丈夫
She was positively identified

469
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,093
在死去的前几秒确认的
by her own husband, seconds before he died.

470
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:42,968
他没理由撒谎  几乎不可能搞错
He had no reason to lie, could hardly have been mistaken.

471
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:45,708
车夫也认识她  那就是她
The cabbie knew her, too, there's no question it's her.

472
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:49,895
但她不可能同时出现在两个地方  对吧
But she can't have been in two places at the same time, can she?

473
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:51,770
不  华生  对于刚死的人来说
No, Watson, one place is strictly the limit

474
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,270
他们只能去一个地方
for the recently deceased.

475
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:54,302
福尔摩斯
Holmes!

476
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:56,354
-可能是双胞胎吗  -不
- Could it have been twins? - No.

477
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,083
为什么
Why not?

478
00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:59,062
因为从来都不是双胞胎
Because it's never twins.

479
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:01,343
艾米丽娅没有双胞胎  也没有姐妹
Emelia was not a twin, nor did she have any sisters.

480
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:04,062
她有一个哥哥  四年前去世了
She had one older brother who died four years ago.

481
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:07,968
也许是秘密的双胞胎
Hmm, maybe it was a secret twin.

482
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,447
什么
A what?!

483
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:11,729
秘密的双胞胎
A secret twin.

484
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,208
知道吗
Hmm? You know?

485
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,666
没人知道的双胞胎
A twin that nobody knows about.

486
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,385
这一切可能是策划好的
This whole thing could have been planned.

487
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,427
从怀孕时开始
Since the moment of conception.

488
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,541
她真是太有先见之明了
How breathtakingly prescient of her.

489
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,604
从来不是双胞胎  华生
It is never twins, Watson!

490
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,760
那你怎么看
Then what's your theory?

491
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,604
更重要的是  你什么毛病
More to the point, what's your problem?

492
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,489
-我不明白  -你为什么这么害怕
- I, I don't understand... - Why were you so frightened?

493
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:33,083
到现在为止  没什么能说明你为什么要喝酒
Nothing so far has justified your assault on my decanter,

494
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,635
还有为什么允许一个死去的女人被逮捕
and why have you allowed a dead woman to be placed under arrest?

495
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,697
因为还有一点"值得注意"
Ah, that would be the other feature of interest.

496
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,187
她指尖上有一些血迹
A smear of blood on her finger.

497
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,385
血迹的由来可以有多种解释
That could have happened any number of ways.

498
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:46,645
没错
Indeed.

499
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,854
还有一点
There's one other thing.

500
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,072
之前没有血迹
It wasn't there earlier.

501
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:54,656
那个也是新的
Neither was that.

502
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:05,802
你
You!

503
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:07,156
你
You?

504
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,093
你
You?!

505
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:10,125
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

506
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,583
吞枪自尽  子弹贯穿头部...
Gun in the mouth, a bullet through the brain...

507
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:20,927
后脑被轰掉
Back of the head blown clean off.

508
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,812
他是怎么活下来的
How could he survive?

509
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,614
你是说"她"吧
"She", you mean.

510
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,614
什么
I'm sorry?

511
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:32,135
不是"他"  是"她"
Not "He", "She".

512
00:21:32,218 --> 00:21:34,104
是  当然了
Yes, yes of course.

513
00:21:36,072 --> 00:21:38,604
谢谢你们给了我这么吸引人的案子
Well, thank you all for a fascinating case.

514
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:41,447
我破案之后会给你们发电报的  华生
I'll send you a telegram when I've solved it. Watson.

515
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,552
死因明显是枪伤
The gunshot wound was obviously the cause of death,

516
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:48,677
但同时有肺痨的明显迹象
but there are clear indicators of consumption.

517
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:50,072
还是验一下尸吧
It might be worth a postmortem.

518
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:52,052
我们需要所有能收集到的线索
We need all the information we can get.

519
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:55,187
老爸一走  他就开始显摆观察力了
Oh, isn't he observant, now that Daddy's gone

520
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,687
我在某些方面观察力确实很强
I am observant in some ways,

521
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,343
就像福尔摩斯在某些方面没有眼力见一样
just as Holmes is quite blind in others.

522
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:09,302
-是吗  -没错
- Really? - Yes, really.

523
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:15,302
为了混进男人的天下  也是蛮拼的啊
Amazing...what one has to do to get ahead in a man's world.

524
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:25,979
他这话什么意思
What's he saying that for?

525
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,281
干你的活儿去
Get back to work!

526
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:39,604
说吧  福尔摩斯  你肯定有些想法吧
Well, Holmes? Surely you must have some theory?

527
00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:40,854
还没有
Not yet.

528
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:44,989
此案非常复杂  华生  很棘手
These are deep waters, Watson, deep waters.

529
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:49,500
但我还得继续深入
And I shall have to go deeper still.

530
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,260
几个月后  我们才又继续
It was not for several months that we were to pick up

531
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,843
调查这件奇案
the threads of this strange case again.

532
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,114
还是在出乎意料的情况之下
And then under very unexpected circumstances.

533
00:23:08,812 --> 00:23:12,000
现在已经五起案子了  每起都一样
Five of them now, all the same, every one of them.

534
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,645
请安静  这件事事关重大
Hush, please, this is a matter of supreme importance.

535
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:16,583
-什么  -黄赤交角
- What is? - The obliquity of the ecliptic.

536
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:17,770
我必须要理解它
I have to understand it.

537
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:18,489
什么东西
What is it?

538
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:20,958
不知道  我还在努力弄懂它
I don't know, I'm still trying to understand it.

539
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,739
-我以为你无所不知  -当然不是了
- I thought you understood everything. - Of course not,

540
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:24,395
那多浪费我大脑的记忆空间
that would be an appalling waste of brain space.

541
00:23:24,395 --> 00:23:25,489
我是专攻类型的
I specialise.

542
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,812
这事为什么重要
And what's so important about this?

543
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:29,062
五起无聊的谋杀案又怎么重要了
What's so important about five boring murders?

544
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:31,645
这可不无聊  五个男人被害
They're not boring. Five men dead,

545
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:34,260
死在家中  地上洒满了生米
murdered in their own homes, rice on the floor

546
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,104
就像在婚礼上一样
like at a wedding,

547
00:23:35,104 --> 00:23:38,072
墙上用血着"你"
and the word "You" written in blood on the wall!

548
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,916
是她  那个鬼新娘
It's, it's her, it's the Bride.

549
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,020
她又复活了
Somehow she's risen again.

550
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,968
解决了
Solved it.

551
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:47,468
你怎么就破案了
You can't have solved it!

552
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,343
我当然破了  非常简单
Of course I've solved it, it's perfectly simple.

553
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:51,062
神秘的瑞克莱蒂太太事件
The incident of the mysterious Mrs Ricoletti,

554
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,343
这位来自阴间的凶手
the killer from beyond the grave,

555
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:54,156
被媒体大肆渲染
has been widely reported in the popular press.

556
00:23:54,156 --> 00:23:56,479
现在有人将自己实施的谋杀
Now people are disguising their own dull little murders

557
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,750
伪装成是鬼魂杀人
as the work of a ghost,

558
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,791
借此迷惑愚蠢的苏格兰场
to confuse the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard.

559
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,093
瞧  我破案了
There you are, solved.

560
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:03,864
你走前跟赫德森太太聊一下
Pay Mrs Hudson a visit on your way out,

561
00:24:03,864 --> 00:24:05,479
她喜欢有参与感
she likes to feel involved.

562
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:06,635
你确定
You sure?

563
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,343
确定  你走吧
Certainly. Go away.

564
00:24:08,343 --> 00:24:10,250
华生  我准备好了
Watson! I'm ready.

565
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,760
戴好帽子穿好鞋  我们有个重要约会
Your hat and boots, we have an important appointment.

566
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,708
华生医生几个月前不是搬走了吗
Didn't Dr Watson move out a few months ago?

567
00:24:17,677 --> 00:24:18,958
他确实搬走了  对吧
He did, didn't he?

568
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,614
那我一直是在跟谁说话来着
Who have I been talking to all this time?

569
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:25,239
我代表愚蠢至极的苏格兰场说一句
Well, speaking on behalf of the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard,

570
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:27,031
那张椅子上没人
that chair is definitely empty.

571
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,760
确实没人吧
It is, isn't it?

572
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,510
但我这些日子过得挺不错的
Works surprisingly well, though.

573
00:24:32,614 --> 00:24:34,458
我还以为他有进步了
I actually thought he was improving.

574
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:13,500
你去哪了
Where have you been?

575
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,375
抱歉  老爷  我今早有些迟了
Sorry, sir, I'm rather behind my time this morning.

576
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,468
你连蛋都不会煮吗
Are you incapable of boiling an egg?!

577
00:25:18,312 --> 00:25:21,041
炉里没有火  到处是灰尘
The fires are rarely lit, there is dust everywhere

578
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:24,000
你清理我靴子上的泥时差点毁了那双鞋
and you almost destroyed my boots scraping the mud off them.

579
00:25:24,187 --> 00:25:26,312
如果不是我妻子掌管佣人的事
If it wasn't my wife's business to deal with the staff,

580
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:27,489
我会亲自管教你
I would talk to you myself.

581
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:28,729
我妻子人呢
Where is my wife?

582
00:25:28,843 --> 00:25:30,760
很抱歉  老爷  夫人出去了
Begging your pardon, sir, but the mistress has gone out.

583
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,187
这么早就出门了吗
Out? At this hour of the morning?

584
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:34,291
是的  老爷  您不知道吗  老爷
Yes, sir. Did you not know that, sir?

585
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:36,552
她去哪了  她最近总出去
Where did she go? She's always out these days.

586
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,145
跟您正好相反  老爷
Not unlike yourself...sir.

587
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:40,312
什么
I'm sorry...?

588
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:42,718
-就是说说我的观察  老爷  -够了
- Just observing, sir. - Well, that's quite enough,

589
00:25:42,718 --> 00:25:43,968
谁让你观察的
nobody asked you to be observant.

590
00:25:43,968 --> 00:25:44,895
抱歉  老爷  我就是说
Sorry, sir, I just meant

591
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:47,000
你们很少一起待在家里了
you're hardly ever home together any more, sir.

592
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,489
你的言行近乎无礼
You are dangerously close to impertinence.

593
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:52,062
我要跟我妻子谈下  让她管教下你了
I shall have a word with my wife to have a word with you.

594
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:56,125
好  老爷  那您什么时候见她呢
Very good, sir. And when will you be seeing her?

595
00:25:57,552 --> 00:25:59,395
-听着...  -我差点忘了  老爷
- Now, listen... - Oh, I nearly forgot, sir.

596
00:25:59,395 --> 00:26:01,614
-有封您的电报  -你忘了
- A telegram came for you. - You forgot?!

597
00:26:01,614 --> 00:26:03,135
没有  只是差点忘了
No, I nearly forgot.

598
00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:04,593
你一上午都在干什么
What have you been doing all morning?

599
00:26:04,593 --> 00:26:06,791
读您《斯特兰德月刊》上的新文章  老爷
Reading your new one in The Strand, sir.

600
00:26:07,718 --> 00:26:08,906
你喜欢吗
Did you enjoy it?

601
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:10,614
您为什么从不提我  老爷
Why do you never mention me, sir?

602
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:11,500
下去吧
Go away.

603
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:31,250
-什么的什么  -黄赤交角
- The what of the what? - The obliquity of the ecliptic.

604
00:26:31,364 --> 00:26:33,729
你说"速来"  我以为是很重要的事
"Come at once," You said. I assumed it was important.

605
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:36,406
是很重要  那是地球的赤道面
It is. It's the inclination of the earth's equator

606
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,854
与其绕太阳运行的轨道平面的夹角
to the path of the sun on the celestial plane.

607
00:26:39,854 --> 00:26:40,677
你是刚学的吧
You been swotting up?

608
00:26:40,677 --> 00:26:42,083
-我为什么要这么做  -为了显得聪明
- Why would I do that? - To sound clever.

609
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:44,395
-我本就聪明  -我懂了
- I am clever. - Oh, oh, I see.

610
00:26:44,656 --> 00:26:45,729
懂什么了
You see what?

611
00:26:46,114 --> 00:26:50,322
我推理我们是要去见某个比你聪明的人
I deduce we're on our way to see someone cleverer than you.

612
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:52,708
闭嘴
Shut up.

613
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:07,479
什么
Sorry, what?

614
00:28:26,552 --> 00:28:30,677
对想研究人类的人来说  这里最合适
To anyone who wishes to study mankind, this is the spot.

615
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:32,645
也很方便  毕竟你那不断扩张的屁股
Handy really, as your ever-expanding backside

616
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:33,937
永远粘在了这里
is permanently glued to it.

617
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:34,947
早上好  我的哥哥
Good morning, brother mine.

618
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:37,270
夏洛克  华生医生
Sherlock. Dr Watson.

619
00:28:38,437 --> 00:28:40,135
您看上去  很不错  先生
You look...well, sir.

620
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,729
真的吗  我觉得我看上去很巨大
Really? I rather thought I looked enormous.

621
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,687
既然您提到了  这种程度的暴饮暴食
Well, now you mention it, this level of consumption

622
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:49,322
对您的健康危害极大
is incredibly injurious to your health.

623
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,281
-您的心脏  -不用担心那个  华生
- Your heart... - No need to worry on that score, Watson.

624
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:54,531
-不吗  -那个器官只会待在一个宽敞的地方
- No? - There's only a large cavity where that organ should reside.

625
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:57,489
-家族通病  -我不是故意说话尖刻
- It's a family trait. - Oh, I wasn't being critical.

626
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,770
如果您继续这样  先生
If you continue like this, sir,

627
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,020
我觉得您最多能活五年
I give you five years at the most.

628
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,208
五年  我们觉得也就是三年
Five? We thought three,

629
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,218
对吧  夏洛克
did we not, Sherlock?

630
00:29:04,218 --> 00:29:05,406
我还是倾向于四年
I'm still inclined to four.

631
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:08,208
还是这样  你看到了却不懂观察
As ever, you see but you do not observe.

632
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:10,135
注意我眼白的颜色发生了变化
Note the discolouration in the whites of my eyes,

633
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:12,541
角膜周围出现可见的脂肪圈
the visible rings of fat around the corneas.

634
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:13,854
你是对的  我改赌三年
Yes, you're right. I'm changing my bet to three years,

635
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:15,510
-四个月零十一天  -打赌
- four months and 11 days. - A bet?!

636
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,229
我理解你不赞同  华生
I understand your disapproval, Watson,

637
00:29:17,343 --> 00:29:18,510
但他好胜心强
but if he's feeling competitive,

638
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,645
可以自己控制早点死亡
it's perfectly within his power to die early.

639
00:29:20,645 --> 00:29:22,437
这也是要冒的风险
That's a risk you'll have to take.

640
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:24,260
你在拿自己的性命打赌
You're gambling with your own life?

641
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,406
为什么不  比拿别人的命打赌有意思多了
Why not? It's so much more exciting than gambling with others'.

642
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,416
整三年  如果你吃了那个葡萄干布丁的话
Three years flat - if you eat that plum pudding!

643
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:29,989
就这么定了
Done.

644
00:29:36,635 --> 00:29:40,333
我以为几天前会因为领主庄园的案子见到你呢
I expected to see you a few days ago about the Manor House case.

645
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,427
我觉得那案子你会有点力不从心
I thought you might be a little out of your depth there.

646
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:43,906
没有  我解决了
No. I solved it.

647
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:46,500
-肯定是亚当斯  -是亚当斯
- It was Adams, of course. - Yes, it was Adams.

648
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,062
嫉妒杀人
Murderous jealousy.

649
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:50,645
他给皇家天文学会写了一篇
He'd written a paper for the Royal Astronomical Society

650
00:29:50,645 --> 00:29:52,906
关于黄赤交角的论文
on the obliquity of the ecliptic,

651
00:29:52,906 --> 00:29:54,052
然后又读到另一篇
and then read another

652
00:29:54,052 --> 00:29:55,718
比他写的好的
that seemed to surpass it.

653
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:56,718
我知道  我读了
I know, I read it.

654
00:29:56,718 --> 00:29:58,052
你看明白了吗
Did you understand it?

655
00:29:58,104 --> 00:30:00,520
我当然明白了  很浅显易懂
Yes, of course I understood it, it was perfectly simple.

656
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,020
不是  你明白嫉妒杀人吗
No, did you understand the murderous jealousy?

657
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:04,375
一个伟大的大脑
It is no easy thing

658
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,718
去考虑一个更伟大的大脑可不容易
for a great mind to contemplate a still greater one.

659
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,760
你召我来就是为了羞辱我吗
Did you summon me here just to humiliate me?

660
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,937
是的
Yes.

661
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,645
当然不是  但这是最大的乐趣
Of course not, but it is by far the greater pleasure.

662
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:17,291
那你能不能解释下为什么要召
Then would you mind explaining exactly why you did summon...?

663
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:20,604
我们的生活方式受到了一个无形敌人的威胁
Our way of life is under threat from an invisible enemy.

664
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:23,843
他们每天都常伴我们身边
One that hovers at our elbow on a daily basis.

665
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:25,895
这些敌人无处不在
These enemies are everywhere...

666
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,885
无人发现
undetected...

667
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,614
无法阻止
and unstoppable.

668
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,031
社会主义者
Socialists?

669
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,666
不是社会主义者  医生  不是
Not socialists, Doctor, no.

670
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,989
-无政府主义者  -不是
- Anarchists? - No.

671
00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:38,458
法国人  妇女参政权论者
The French? The suffragists?

672
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,375
还有什么大规模团体是你不担心的吗
Is there any large body of people you're not concerned about?

673
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:44,458
华生医生永远心怀警惕  详说
Dr Watson is endlessly vigilant. Elaborate...

674
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,854
不  去调查
No. Investigate.

675
00:30:45,854 --> 00:30:48,604
这是我的推测  我需要你去证实
This is a conjecture of mine, I need you to confirm it.

676
00:30:48,604 --> 00:30:50,250
我给你个案子
I'm sending you a case.

677
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,343
-苏格兰人  -苏格兰人
- The Scots? - The Scots?!

678
00:30:52,614 --> 00:30:54,447
你是否知道最近
Are you aware of recent theories concerning

679
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:55,937
关于妄想症的理论
what is known as paranoia?

680
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,625
听着像是塞尔维亚人
Oh, sounds Serbian.

681
00:30:57,927 --> 00:31:00,666
会有个女人去找你  卡迈克夫人
A woman will call on you. Lady Carmichael.

682
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,093
你得接她的案子
I want you to take her case.

683
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:04,083
但这些敌人  如果你不告诉我们
But these enemies, how are we to defeat them

684
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:05,510
我们怎么打败他们
if you won't tell us about them?

685
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,427
我们不会打败他们
We don't defeat them.

686
00:31:07,427 --> 00:31:09,583
我们几乎绝对要输给他们
We most certainly lose to them.

687
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:11,125
为什么
Why?

688
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:16,833
因为他们是正确的  我们是错的
Because they are right. And we are wrong.

689
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,989
卡迈克夫人的案子  是什么
Lady Carmichael's case, what is it?

690
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:22,625
放心  会有值得你注意的地方
Rest assured, it has features of interest.

691
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,968
-我从没这么说过  -你真说过
- I never really say that. - You really do.

692
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:26,625
我估计你已经解决了
And you've solved it already, I assume?

693
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:30,916
只是设想而已  我要你去跑腿
Only in my head. I need you for the, er, legwork.

694
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,770
为什么不告诉我们你的答案
Why not just tell us your solution?

695
00:31:32,781 --> 00:31:34,687
那还有什么意思呢
And where would be the sport in that?

696
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,218
你愿意接吗  夏洛克
Will you do it, Sherlock?

697
00:31:36,218 --> 00:31:38,906
这绝对是极好的消遣
I can promise you a superior distraction.

698
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:41,479
我有一个条件  你再吃一个葡萄干布丁
On one condition. Have another plum pudding.

699
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:42,812
本来就准备吃了
There's one on the way.

700
00:31:42,812 --> 00:31:44,500
两年十一个月四天
Two years, 11 months and four days.

701
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,145
开始好玩喽  滴答  滴答  滴答
Ha, it's getting exciting now! Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

702
00:31:52,822 --> 00:31:54,885
谢谢  怀尔德
Thank you, Wilder.

703
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:57,979
有一位梅尔斯先生要见你  福尔摩斯先生
Also, a Mr Melas to see you, Mr Holmes.

704
00:31:57,979 --> 00:32:01,322
等我五分钟  我还有一场赌局要赢呢
Give me five minutes, I have a wager to win.

705
00:32:04,093 --> 00:32:06,927
还是十五分钟吧
Better make that 15.

706
00:32:08,322 --> 00:32:09,791
滴答
Ticktock.

707
00:32:13,604 --> 00:32:16,197
福尔摩斯先生  我是来请您出主意的
Mr Holmes, I have come here for advice.

708
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:18,541
-这个不难  -还有您的帮助
- That is easily got. - And help.

709
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:20,072
这就未必容易了
Not always so easy.

710
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:24,864
有古怪的事发生了  福尔摩斯先生
Something has happened, Mr Holmes, something...unusual

711
00:32:24,864 --> 00:32:27,531
而且很可怕
and...terrifying.

712
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:28,885
那你真是太幸运了
Then you are in luck.

713
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:29,927
幸运吗
Luck?!

714
00:32:30,072 --> 00:32:32,895
那是我的专长  真的是很有前途啊
Those are my specialisms. This is really very promising.

715
00:32:32,895 --> 00:32:34,031
福尔摩斯...
Holmes...

716
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,854
请说说  您究竟在担忧什么
Please...do tell us what has so distressed you.

717
00:32:40,468 --> 00:32:43,572
我想了很久该怎么办
I, I thought long and hard as to what to do,

718
00:32:43,572 --> 00:32:46,604
后来突然想起  我丈夫
but then it occurred to me that my husband was

719
00:32:46,604 --> 00:32:49,604
是您哥哥相识  也许通过他...
an acquaintance of your brother and that perhaps through him...

720
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:52,510
其实我也不确定
The fact is, I'm not sure

721
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,125
这事是否该找您  福尔摩斯先生
this comes within your purview, Mr Holmes.

722
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:54,927
是吗
No?

723
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:58,875
天啊  这或许是驱魔牧师的事
Lord help me, I think it may be a matter for a priest.

724
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:03,875
你的晨间危机是什么  亲爱的
And what does your morning threaten, my dear?

725
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:08,020
绣花绣得停不下来
A vigorous round of embroidering?

726
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,937
还是跟女帽匠频繁的见面
An exhausting appointment at the milliners?

727
00:33:09,937 --> 00:33:12,104
你就爱戏弄我  尤斯塔斯
I hope you are teasing, Eustace.

728
00:33:23,562 --> 00:33:24,500
怎么了
What is it?

729
00:33:25,718 --> 00:33:26,718
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?

730
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:29,989
丹尼尔  索菲  出去玩会儿
Daniel, Sophie, go out and play.

731
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:30,708
妈妈...
But, Mama...

732
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:32,416
听话  快去
Look, do as I tell you, quickly now.

733
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:50,875
尤斯塔斯  这是什么意思
Well, Eustace, what does this mean?

734
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:56,145
死亡
Death.

735
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:57,697
什么
What?

736
00:33:58,114 --> 00:33:59,875
这意味着死亡
It means death.

737
00:34:03,864 --> 00:34:07,541
没什么  没什么
Er, nothing, it's, it's nothing.

738
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:10,000
我弄错了
I was...mistaken.

739
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,250
亲爱的  你的脸色怎么这么苍白
My dear, you've gone quite pale.

740
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,552
没事的
It's nothing!

741
00:34:17,843 --> 00:34:18,583
尤斯塔斯
Eustace...

742
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,062
信封您留着吗
Did you keep the envelope?

743
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:23,250
被我丈夫毁了  但上面什么也没有
My husband destroyed it, but it was blank.

744
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,979
没有姓名  地址  任何信息
No name or address of any kind.

745
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:28,145
尤斯塔斯爵士在美国待过吗
Tell me, has Sir Eustace spent time in America?

746
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:31,468
-没有  -你们结婚前也没有吗
- No. - Not even before your marriage?

747
00:34:31,468 --> 00:34:33,020
据我所知没有
Well, not to my knowledge.

748
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,729
请您继续往下说吧
Pray, continue with your fascinating narrative.

749
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,593
这是上周一早上的事
Well, that incident took place last Monday morning.

750
00:34:42,937 --> 00:34:44,781
两天后的周三
It was two days later on the Wednesday

751
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:46,625
我丈夫第一次看见了她
that my husband first saw her.

752
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:48,572
谁
Who?

753
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,625
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?

754
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,687
她来找我了  路易莎
She's come for me, Louisa!

755
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:06,197
天啊  帮帮我  我的罪来找我了
Oh, God, help me, my sins have found me out!

756
00:35:06,197 --> 00:35:10,145
谁来找你了  尤斯塔斯  你吓到我了
Who's come for you? Eustace, you're frightening me.

757
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:12,364
看啊  看啊
Well, look, look!

758
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:17,750
你没看见吗
Don't you see her?

759
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:20,250
我什么也没看见
No, I see no-one.

760
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:27,010
走了
Gone.

761
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:34,437
你对我隐瞒了那么多秘密  这是另一个吗
You keep so many secrets from me, is this another?

762
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,958
你看到了谁
Who have you seen?

763
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:38,875
是她
It was her!

764
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,864
是鬼新娘
It was the Bride!

765
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:47,031
而您什么也没看见
And you saw nothing?

766
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,135
是的
Nothing.

767
00:35:48,135 --> 00:35:52,229
-您丈夫描述过...  -没有  直到今早
- Did your husband describe...? - Nothing, until this morning.

768
00:36:08,135 --> 00:36:09,666
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

769
00:36:22,895 --> 00:36:24,354
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

770
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:35,260
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?

771
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,166
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

772
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,385
该死
Blast!

773
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,656
尤斯塔斯
Eustace?!

774
00:36:49,364 --> 00:36:51,239
你在哪  是我
Where are you? It's me!

775
00:36:53,822 --> 00:36:57,635
*别忘了我*
*Do not forget me*

776
00:36:58,145 --> 00:37:03,260
*别忘了我*
*Do not forget me*

777
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,302
*记住那少女*
*Remember the maid*

778
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:11,968
*磨坊的少女*
*he maid of the mill*

779
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,510
你是谁
Who are you?

780
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:32,302
我命令你  报上姓名
I demand you speak, who are you?!

781
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,791
尤斯塔斯  跟我说说话  天啊
Eustace, speak to me. In the name of God!

782
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:43,645
她是...
She's...

783
00:37:44,552 --> 00:37:46,843
她是艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂
She is Emelia Ricoletti.

784
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:57,302
不  不是你
No, not you.

785
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:00,656
不
No...

786
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,104
求你了
Please!

787
00:38:03,229 --> 00:38:05,989
今晚  尤斯塔斯・卡迈克
This night, Eustace Carmichael,

788
00:38:06,427 --> 00:38:09,927
你将必死
you will die!

789
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:40,291
-福尔摩斯  -别说话  华生
- Holmes? - Hush, Watson.

790
00:38:40,364 --> 00:38:42,541
艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂  那个新娘
But Emelia Ricoletti, the Bride.

791
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:44,729
-你知道她  -请原谅华生
- Well, you know the name? - You must forgive Watson,

792
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:47,270
他就喜欢说出一些显而易见的事实
he has an enthusiasm for stating the obvious,

793
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,364
近乎狂热
which borders on mania.

794
00:38:48,364 --> 00:38:50,385
容我问一句  您丈夫今早怎么样
May I ask, how is your husband this morning?

795
00:38:50,447 --> 00:38:52,395
他不肯谈这件事
He refuses to speak about the matter.

796
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,750
当然了  我敦促他离开家
Obviously, I have urged him to leave the house.

797
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,354
不不  他得待在家里
No, no, he must stay exactly where he is.

798
00:38:56,364 --> 00:38:57,791
你不认为他有生命危险吗
Well, you don't think he's in danger?

799
00:38:57,947 --> 00:38:59,604
当然有  是有人想要他的命
Oh, no, somebody definitely wants to kill him,

800
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:02,322
但这对我们是好事  没有饵就钓不到鱼
but that's good for us. You can't set a trap without bait.

801
00:39:02,781 --> 00:39:04,718
我丈夫可不是诱饵  福尔摩斯先生
My husband is not bait, Mr Holmes.

802
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,343
如果我们做对了  他可以做诱饵
No, but he could be if we play our cards right.

803
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:08,875
听着  您现在立刻回家
Now, listen, you must go home immediately.

804
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:10,729
华生医生和我会乘下一班火车跟上
Dr. Watson and I will follow on the next train.

805
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:11,770
一刻也不能耽搁了
There's not a moment to lose,

806
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,322
尤斯塔斯爵士今晚就要死了
Sir Eustace is to die tonight.

807
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:13,875
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

808
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,437
我们也许该阻止此事
And we should...probably avoid that.

809
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,020
-一定要  -一定要避免
- Definitely. - Definitely avoid that.

810
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:28,770
我弟弟接了这案子  当然了
Little brother has taken the case, of course.

811
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,260
那就拜托你留意情况了
I now rely on you to keep an eye on things,

812
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,645
但绝不能让他怀疑你在帮我
but he must never suspect you are working for me.

813
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,947
清楚了吗  华生
Are you clear on that, Watson?

814
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,687
你可以相信我  福尔摩斯先生
You can rely on me, Mr Holmes.

815
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:47,218
-你说会不会...  -不会
- You don't suppose... - No, I don't

816
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,104
你也不该这么想
and neither should you.

817
00:39:48,104 --> 00:39:49,447
你不知道我要说什么
You don't know what I was going to say.

818
00:39:49,447 --> 00:39:51,770
你是想说  可能有什么超自然的东西
You were about to suggest there may be some supernatural agency

819
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,500
牵扯其中  而我打算当面嘲笑你
involved in this matter. And I was about to laugh in your face.

820
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,833
可那个新娘  福尔摩斯
But the Bride, Holmes,

821
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,562
又是艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂
Emelia Ricoletti again.

822
00:39:57,614 --> 00:39:59,312
一个死去的女人活过来了
A dead woman walking the earth.

823
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,197
-你真让我惊讶  华生  -是吗
- You amaze me, Watson. - I do?

824
00:40:02,687 --> 00:40:04,739
你什么时候开始有想象力了
Since when have you had any kind of imagination?

825
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:08,593
或许是从我让读者相信
Perhaps since I convinced the reading public that

826
00:40:08,593 --> 00:40:11,197
某个不道德的吸毒者是个绅士英雄开始
an unprincipled drug addict was some kind of gentleman hero.

827
00:40:11,552 --> 00:40:14,156
是啊  说到这个  还真是了不起
Yes, now you come to mention it, that was quite impressive.

828
00:40:14,864 --> 00:40:18,458
但你可以确信  这世上没有鬼
You may, however, rest assured there are no ghosts in this world.

829
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,510
除了我们自己想象的
Save those we make for ourselves.

830
00:40:26,395 --> 00:40:27,822
抱歉  你说什么
Sorry, what did you say?

831
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:31,375
我们自己想象的鬼  是什么意思
Ghosts we make for ourselves, what do you mean?

832
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,562
梦游症
Somnambulism.

833
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,291
抱歉  什么
I beg your pardon?

834
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:43,229
我会梦游  就这样
I sleepwalk, that's all.

835
00:40:43,572 --> 00:40:44,854
这再正常不过了
It's a common enough condition.

836
00:40:44,854 --> 00:40:46,239
你不是医生吗
I thought you were a doctor!

837
00:40:46,385 --> 00:40:49,437
这整件事就是一场噩梦
The whole thing was a...bad dream.

838
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:52,270
包括你收到的信封里的东西吗
Including the contents of the envelope you received?

839
00:40:52,927 --> 00:40:54,947
那是个古怪的玩笑
Well, that's a grotesque joke.

840
00:40:54,947 --> 00:40:57,177
你在你妻子面前的表现可并非如此  先生
Well, that's not the impression you gave your wife, sir.

841
00:40:57,666 --> 00:41:00,916
-她有癔病  会妄想  -不
- She's an hysteric, prone to fancies. - No.

842
00:41:03,197 --> 00:41:04,583
不好意思  你说什么
I'm sorry, what did you say?

843
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:06,562
我说不  她没有癔病
I said no, she's not an hysteric.

844
00:41:06,562 --> 00:41:08,968
她是个非常聪明的女人  有着少见的洞察力
She's a highly intelligent woman of rare perception.

845
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,052
我妻子从桔核里看出了恐惧
My wife sees terror in an orange pip.

846
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:15,093
你的妻子能在旁人看不见任何价值的地方
Your wife can see worlds where no-one else can see

847
00:41:15,093 --> 00:41:16,885
看出很多东西
anything of value whatsoever.

848
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,302
真的吗
Can she really?

849
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:22,635
那你是如何"推理"出来的呢  福尔摩斯先生
And how do you "Deduce" that, Mr Holmes?

850
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,062
她嫁给了你
She married you.

851
00:41:24,062 --> 00:41:26,187
我想她一定有个合理的理由
I assume she was capable of finding a reason.

852
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,770
今晚我会尽力保护你的安全
I'll do my best to save your life tonight,

853
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,531
但如果你能解释一下
but first it would help

854
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:32,354
你和瑞克莱蒂一案的关系  会大有帮助
if you would explain your connection to the Ricoletti case.

855
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,406
瑞克莱蒂
Ricoletti?

856
00:41:35,531 --> 00:41:37,718
是的  拜托具体些
Yes. In detail, please.

857
00:41:38,677 --> 00:41:39,843
我从没听说过她
I've never heard of her.

858
00:41:39,843 --> 00:41:42,041
有意思  我没说瑞克莱蒂是个女人
Interesting. I didn't mention she was a woman.

859
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,093
我们告辞了  希望明早能再见到你
We'll show ourselves out. I hope to see you again in the morning.

860
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:46,802
不会的
You will not.

861
00:41:46,802 --> 00:41:49,541
那真不幸  我就得破你的谋杀案了  日安
Then sadly I shall be solving your murder. Good day.

862
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:56,906
你尽力了
Well, you tried.

863
00:41:58,822 --> 00:42:00,958
请把这个交给卡迈克夫人  谢谢
Will you see that Lady Carmichael receives this. Thank you.

864
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:02,104
-再见  -没问题  先生
- Good afternoon. - Certainly, sir.

865
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:04,510
那是什么
What was that?

866
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,947
卡迈克夫人今晚单独睡
Lady Carmichael will sleep alone tonight,

867
00:42:05,947 --> 00:42:07,520
假装头痛难忍
upon the pretence of a violent headache.

868
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:09,645
整个宅子的门窗都要紧锁
All the doors and windows of the house will be locked.

869
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:14,677
你觉得那幽灵  鬼新娘
You think the spectre, er, Bride,

870
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:17,697
会试图再次把尤斯塔斯引到外面吗
will attempt to lure Sir Eustace outside again?

871
00:42:18,031 --> 00:42:20,229
当然了  否则为什么放出威胁
Certainly. Why else the portentous threat?

872
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:21,729
"今晚  你将必死"
"This night you will die!"

873
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,479
但他不会跟她去吧
Well, he won't follow her, surely?

874
00:42:23,552 --> 00:42:25,395
他会怎么做  很难说
Hmm, it's difficult to say quite what he'll do.

875
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,229
愧疚在吞噬他的灵魂
Guilt is eating away at his soul.

876
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:29,229
愧疚  关于什么
Guilt? About what?

877
00:42:29,229 --> 00:42:31,958
他过去的某件事  那些桔核是一个提醒
Something in his past. The orange pips were a reminder.

878
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:33,770
-不是玩笑吗  -完全不是
- Not a joke? - Not at all.

879
00:42:34,114 --> 00:42:36,458
桔核是传统中用来预警偿命的
Orange pips are a traditional warning of avenging death,

880
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,812
起源于美国
originating in America.

881
00:42:37,906 --> 00:42:39,625
尤斯塔斯爵士对此再了解不过了
Sir Eustace knows this only too well,

882
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:42,406
他也很清楚自己为什么要受惩罚
just as he knows why he is to be punished.

883
00:42:42,822 --> 00:42:44,625
和艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂有关吗
Something to do with Emelia Ricoletti?

884
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,489
我想是的
I presume.

885
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:48,812
我们都有过去  华生  有"鬼"
We all have a past, Watson. Ghosts.

886
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,427
它们是我们每个晴天里无法驱走的阴影
They are the shadows that define our every sunny day.

887
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:54,031
尤斯塔斯爵士知道自己逃不过了
Sir Eustace knows he's a marked man.

888
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,479
他恐惧的不仅仅是死亡
There's something more than murder he fears.

889
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:00,270
他认为死去的瑞克莱蒂太太复活的尸体
He believes he is to be dragged to hell by the risen corpse

890
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,083
会把他拖进地狱
of the late Mrs Ricoletti.

891
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,614
这太荒谬了  不是吗
That's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?

892
00:43:06,614 --> 00:43:08,583
老天  是啊  你的左轮手枪带了吗
God, yes. Did you bring your revolver?

893
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:10,093
手枪在幽灵面前有什么用
What good would that be against a ghost?

894
00:43:10,093 --> 00:43:11,875
-对极了  你带了吗  -当然了
- Exactly. Did you bring it? - Yeah, of course.

895
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:13,697
那就来吧  华生  来吧
Then come, Watson, come.

896
00:43:13,937 --> 00:43:15,552
游戏开始了
The game is afoot.

897
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,416
-蹲下  华生  老天爷  -抱歉  抽筋了
- Get down, Watson, for heaven's sake! - Sorry. Cramp.

898
00:43:31,906 --> 00:43:34,343
-灯还亮着吗  -是的
- Is the lamp still burning? - Yes.

899
00:43:37,729 --> 00:43:39,291
尤斯塔斯爵士的灯灭了
There goes Sir Eustace.

900
00:43:41,187 --> 00:43:43,041
卡迈克夫人的也灭了
And Lady Carmichael.

901
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:45,979
宅子睡下了
The house sleeps.

902
00:43:48,854 --> 00:43:51,343
老天  这是我这辈子最漫长的一夜了
Hmm, good God, this is the longest night of my life.

903
00:43:51,343 --> 00:43:53,322
耐心点  华生
Have patience, Watson.

904
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:56,625
才到午夜
Only midnight.

905
00:43:58,718 --> 00:44:02,093
我们很少这样坐在一起
You know, it's rare for us to sit together like this.

906
00:44:02,197 --> 00:44:04,968
希望如此  我们在等待谋杀案
I should hope so. It's murder on the knees.

907
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:11,114
两个老朋友说着话  聊着天
Two old friends just talking. Chewing the fat.

908
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:13,510
男人对男人
Man-to-man.

909
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,427
非凡的女人
So, a remarkable woman.

910
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:22,395
-谁  -卡迈克夫人
- Who? - Lady Carmichael.

911
00:44:22,395 --> 00:44:24,416
女性是你的专长  华生
The fair sex is your department, Watson.

912
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:25,520
你说什么就是什么
I'll take your word for it.

913
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:28,031
你挺喜欢她  "她有着少见的洞察力"
Well, you liked her. "A woman of rare perception."

914
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,718
和美妙的高足弓
And admirably high arches.

915
00:44:29,729 --> 00:44:31,572
她一进房间  我就注意到了
I noticed them as soon as she stepped into the room.

916
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:33,906
-她太好了  他配不上  -你这么认为吗
- Huh, she's far too good for him. - You think so?

917
00:44:33,906 --> 00:44:35,614
不  是你这么认为  我看得出来
No. You think so. I could tell.

918
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,718
恰恰相反  我对此毫无看法
On the contrary, I have no view on the matter.

919
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:38,864
不  你有
Yes, you have.

920
00:44:41,187 --> 00:44:43,572
婚姻不是我会思考的问题
Marriage is not a subject upon which I dwell.

921
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:45,406
-为什么  -你今晚是怎么回事
- Oh, why not? - What's the matter with you this evening?

922
00:44:45,406 --> 00:44:48,927
你戴的那块表  里面有张照片
That watch that you're wearing, there's a photograph inside it.

923
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:52,656
我瞥过一眼  我想那是艾琳・阿德勒
I glimpsed it once. I believe it is of Irene Adler.

924
00:44:52,697 --> 00:44:54,781
你不只是瞥了一眼  你是等我睡着了
You didn't glimpse it, you waited till I'd fallen asleep

925
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:56,760
-才拿去看的  -是这样没错
- and looked at it. - Yes, I did.

926
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,552
-你真以为我不会发现吗  -艾琳・阿德勒
- You seriously thought I wouldn't notice? - Irene Adler.

927
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,958
一位强大的对手  一次了不起的冒险
Formidable opponent, a remarkable adventure.

928
00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:04,010
-一张漂亮的照片  -你为什么要谈这些
- A very nice photograph. - Why are you talking like this?

929
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,552
你为什么坚决要独身
Why are you so determined to be alone?

930
00:45:05,552 --> 00:45:06,843
你没事吧  华生
Are you quite well, Watson?

931
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:08,239
这问题就这么奇怪吗
Is it such a curious question?

932
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:09,697
对于维也纳精神病医生来说  不奇怪
From a Viennese alienist, no.

933
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:12,187
对于退役的军医来说  当然奇怪
From a retired army surgeon, most certainly.

934
00:45:12,354 --> 00:45:16,114
福尔摩斯  我是毫无竞争对手的
Holmes, against absolutely no opposition whatsoever,

935
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:18,947
-你最亲密的朋友  -我承认
- I am your closest friend. - I concede it.

936
00:45:19,218 --> 00:45:21,562
我现在是想和你
I am currently attempting to have a perfectly

937
00:45:21,614 --> 00:45:23,000
再正常不过地交谈
normal conversation with you.

938
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,114
别这样
Please don't.

939
00:45:24,114 --> 00:45:26,822
你为什么非要独身
Why do you need to be alone?

940
00:45:27,229 --> 00:45:29,197
如果你指的是感情纠葛  华生
If you are referring to romantic entanglement, Watson,

941
00:45:29,197 --> 00:45:31,968
恐怕你就是  正如我以前常说过的
which I rather fear you are, as I have often explained before,

942
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:34,187
我憎恶一切感情
all emotion is abhorrent to me.

943
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:37,114
感情是干扰灵敏仪器的沙粒
It is the grit in a sensitive instrument.

944
00:45:37,322 --> 00:45:39,458
-镜片上的裂纹  -镜片上的裂纹  对
- The crack in the lens. - The crack in the lens. Yes.

945
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:40,708
这就是了
Well, there you are, you see,

946
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:42,875
-我之前都说过  -不  这都是我写的
- I've said it all before. - No, I wrote all that.

947
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:44,968
你在援引《斯特兰德月刊》中你自己的话
You're quoting yourself from The Strand Magazine.

948
00:45:44,968 --> 00:45:45,833
说得对
Well, exactly.

949
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:48,479
那些是我的话  不是你的
Those are my words, not yours!

950
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,770
那是我向公众展示的你
That is the version of you that I present to the public.

951
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,343
没有感情的头脑  计算机器
The brain without a heart. The calculating machine.

952
00:45:55,343 --> 00:45:57,322
那些都是我写的  福尔摩斯
I write all of that, Holmes,

953
00:45:57,322 --> 00:45:59,947
读者们也欣然接受  但我不相信
and the readers lap it up. But I do not believe it.

954
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:01,302
我非常想给你的编辑写信
Well, I've a good mind to write to your editor.

955
00:46:01,312 --> 00:46:02,885
你是一个活生生的人
You are a living, breathing man.

956
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:05,656
-你也有生活  也有过去  -有什么
- You've lived a life, you have a past. - A what?!

957
00:46:05,656 --> 00:46:07,614
-你肯定有过...  -有什么
- Well, you must have had... - Had what?

958
00:46:09,927 --> 00:46:11,218
-你懂的  -不懂
- You know. - No.

959
00:46:13,072 --> 00:46:14,333
经历
Experiences.

960
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:17,041
把左轮手枪递给我  我突然需要用一下
Pass me your revolver, I have a sudden need to use it.

961
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:18,916
见鬼  福尔摩斯  你也是血肉之躯
Damn it, Holmes, you are flesh and blood,

962
00:46:18,927 --> 00:46:20,854
也有感情  你有...
you have feelings, you have...

963
00:46:20,854 --> 00:46:24,156
你肯定有...冲动
You must have... impulses.

964
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,885
天啊  我从未如此盼望
Dear Lord, I have never been so impatient

965
00:46:25,885 --> 00:46:27,729
被杀人不眨眼的鬼魂攻击
to be attacked by a murderous ghost.

966
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:32,031
作为你的朋友  作为担心你的人
As your friend, as someone who worries about you...

967
00:46:33,812 --> 00:46:35,281
是什么让你变成这样的
What made you like this?

968
00:46:37,468 --> 00:46:38,854
华生...
Oh, Watson...

969
00:46:40,822 --> 00:46:42,697
没什么塑造了我
Nothing made me.

970
00:46:44,822 --> 00:46:46,416
我塑造了自己
I made me.

971
00:46:48,187 --> 00:46:49,364
红胡子
Redbeard?

972
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:51,322
我的天啊
Good God!

973
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,239
我们该怎么办
What are we to do?

974
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:05,250
我们去跟她聊聊吧
Why don't we have a chat?

975
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:14,416
是瑞克莱蒂太太吧
Mrs Ricoletti, I believe!

976
00:47:15,437 --> 00:47:17,562
就这个时节来说  真是宜人的一晚
A pleasant night for the time of year, is it not?

977
00:47:17,604 --> 00:47:19,750
这不可能  福尔摩斯  不可能
It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot!

978
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:20,833
是不可能
No, it can't.

979
00:47:31,197 --> 00:47:33,000
-锁上了  -按照要求锁着
- Is it locked? - As per instruction.

980
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:34,364
那是打破窗户的声音  是吗
That was a window breaking, wasn't it?

981
00:47:34,364 --> 00:47:36,677
我们只需要担心一扇打破的窗户
There's only one broken window we need concern ourselves with.

982
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,093
-待在这儿  华生  -什么  不
- Stay here, Watson. - What? No.

983
00:47:50,093 --> 00:47:52,052
进出房子所有的门窗都锁着
All the doors and windows to the house are locked.

984
00:47:52,104 --> 00:47:54,020
这是他们唯一的出口  我需要你在这儿守着
This is their only way out, I need you here!

985
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,052
但那声音很接近了
But the sound was so close.

986
00:47:55,052 --> 00:47:57,343
-肯定是从房子这一侧传来的  -守在这儿
- It had to be from this side of the house. - Stay here!

987
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:13,833
不
No!

988
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:24,927
你答应过保护他安全的  你答应过的
You promised to keep him safe. You promised!

989
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,114
你...
You...

990
00:48:51,677 --> 00:48:53,531
你是人  我知道的
You're human, I know that.

991
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,083
你肯定是
You must be.

992
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:06,510
我们这样站在黑暗中也没什么用
Little use us standing here in the dark.

993
00:49:07,927 --> 00:49:11,562
毕竟  这是十九世纪
After all, this is the 19th century.

994
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,156
别忘了我
Do not forget me!

995
00:49:58,822 --> 00:50:03,729
别忘了我
Do not forget me!

996
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:12,947
-华生  -她在那儿  她就在那边
- Watson! - She's there! She's down there!

997
00:50:12,947 --> 00:50:14,395
别告诉我你擅离职守了
Don't tell me you abandoned your post!

998
00:50:14,395 --> 00:50:16,322
什么  福尔摩斯  她在那儿  我看见她了
What? Holmes, she's there, I saw her!

999
00:50:20,781 --> 00:50:22,208
没人了  都怪你
Empty, thanks to you!

1000
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:24,416
煮熟的鸭子飞了
Our bird is flown!

1001
00:50:24,427 --> 00:50:27,083
不  福尔摩斯  不是你想的那样
No! No, Holmes, it wasn't what you think.

1002
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:28,489
我看见她了  鬼魂
I saw her! The ghost!

1003
00:50:28,489 --> 00:50:31,031
根本没有鬼魂
There are no ghosts!

1004
00:50:34,645 --> 00:50:37,739
发生什么了  尤斯塔斯爵士在哪
What happened? Where is Sir Eustace?

1005
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,125
死了
Dead.

1006
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,864
你不能怪自己
You really mustn't blame yourself, you know.

1007
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:49,458
是  你说得对
No, you're quite right.

1008
00:50:50,145 --> 00:50:51,447
很高兴你在逐渐开悟
I'm glad you're seeing sense.

1009
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:52,750
华生也应该受谴责
Watson is equally culpable.

1010
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,218
我们搞砸了整个案子
Between us, we've managed to botch this whole case.

1011
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:57,052
我做出承诺  要保护那个人
I gave an undertaking to protect that man,

1012
00:50:57,062 --> 00:50:58,895
结果他现在胸口插着匕首  倒在那里
now he's lying there with a dagger in his breast.

1013
00:50:58,895 --> 00:51:01,500
其实  你承诺的是调查他的谋杀案
In fact, you gave an undertaking to investigate his murder.

1014
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,833
满怀没这个必要的自信
In the confident expectation I would not have to!

1015
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:08,166
你能告诉我们什么吗  医生
Anything you can tell us, Doctor?

1016
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:12,583
凶手刺杀他的力度可不小
Well, he's been stabbed with considerable force.

1017
00:51:12,677 --> 00:51:13,906
这么说  是男性
It's a man, then?

1018
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:15,906
可能是
Possibly.

1019
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,875
刀刃非常锋利  也可能是女性
A very keen blade, so it could conceivably have been a woman?

1020
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,979
从理论上说  是的
In theory, yes,

1021
00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:21,697
但我们知道是谁  我看见她了
but we know who it was, I saw her.

1022
00:51:21,697 --> 00:51:23,760
-华生  -我看见鬼魂了  亲眼所见
- Watson! - I saw the ghost, with my own eyes!

1023
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,895
你什么也没看见  你看到了别人演的
You saw nothing! You saw what you were supposed to see!

1024
00:51:25,895 --> 00:51:27,812
你自己说过的  我没有想象力
You said yourself, I have no imagination.

1025
00:51:27,812 --> 00:51:29,968
那就动动脑  去掉不可能的情况
Then use your brain, such as it is, to eliminate the impossible,

1026
00:51:29,968 --> 00:51:31,385
在这桩案子中就是鬼魂
which in this case is the ghost,

1027
00:51:31,395 --> 00:51:33,718
并且观察余下的  就此而言  就是答案
and observe what remains, which in this case is a solution

1028
00:51:33,718 --> 00:51:36,364
十分明显  就连雷斯垂德也能想明白
so blindingly obvious even Lestrade could work it out!

1029
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:37,281
谢谢
Thank you!

1030
00:51:37,281 --> 00:51:39,375
别去想什么来自冥界的幽灵了
Forget spectres from the other world!

1031
00:51:39,677 --> 00:51:42,520
只有一个嫌疑人有作案动机和机会
There is only one suspect with motive and opportunity.

1032
00:51:42,614 --> 00:51:43,843
他们简直与留了字条无异
They might as well have left a note.

1033
00:51:43,843 --> 00:51:45,093
他们确实留下了字条
They did leave a note.

1034
00:51:45,156 --> 00:51:47,239
然后还有另一扇破窗的问题
And then there's the matter of the other broken window.

1035
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:50,166
-什么另一扇破窗  -说得对  根本没有
- What other broken window? - Precisely! There isn't one.

1036
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:52,802
唯一一扇破窗就是我和华生进来的那扇
The only broken window is the one that Watson and I entered through,

1037
00:51:52,812 --> 00:51:54,947
但在那之前  我们清楚地听见了声音...
yet, prior to that, we distinctly heard the sound of...

1038
00:51:54,947 --> 00:51:56,645
-你刚才说什么  -你说什么
- What did you just say? - Sorry?

1039
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,854
关于字条  你刚才说什么
About a note, what did you just say?

1040
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,625
-我说凶手确实留下了字条  -不  没有
- I said the murderer DID leave a note. - No, they didn't.

1041
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,583
匕首上系了张字条  你肯定看见了
There's a message tied to the dagger. You must have seen it!

1042
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:05,729
-没有什么字条  -有的
- There's no message. - Yes!

1043
00:52:05,729 --> 00:52:07,583
我发现尸体的时候上面没有字条
There was no message when I found the body.

1044
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:26,645
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

1045
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:31,843
上面写了什么
What is it?

1046
00:52:51,218 --> 00:52:52,479
你想吗
Do you?

1047
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,468
我想什么
Do I what?

1048
00:52:57,656 --> 00:52:59,656
你怎么拿到这个的
H-how did you get that?

1049
00:52:59,656 --> 00:53:01,927
我把它留在犯罪现场了
I left it at the crime scene.

1050
00:53:02,395 --> 00:53:03,656
犯罪现场
"Crime scene"?

1051
00:53:03,906 --> 00:53:06,729
你从哪学来的这些词汇
Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions?

1052
00:53:06,864 --> 00:53:08,135
你想他吗
Do you miss him?

1053
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:10,052
莫里亚蒂已经死了
Moriarty is dead.

1054
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,500
但是
And yet...?

1055
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,229
我们没找到他的尸体
His body was never recovered.

1056
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:19,770
一个被推下瀑布的数学教授是该找不到
To be expected when one pushes a maths professor over a waterfall.

1057
00:53:20,177 --> 00:53:23,125
纯粹理性被惊险的情节推翻
Pure reason toppled by sheer melodrama.

1058
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,760
一句话概括了你的生活
Your life in a nutshell.

1059
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:28,937
你从哪学来的这些词汇
Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions?

1060
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:44,906
你又胖了吗
Have you put on weight?

1061
00:53:45,593 --> 00:53:48,427
你昨天才见过我  你觉得可能吗
You saw me only yesterday. Does that seem possible?

1062
00:53:48,552 --> 00:53:49,520
不可能
No.

1063
00:53:49,531 --> 00:53:51,562
但我的确又胖了
Yet here I am, increased.

1064
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:52,739
全英格兰
What does that tell

1065
00:53:52,822 --> 00:53:55,520
最好的犯罪调查专家能从中悟到什么
the foremost criminal investigator in England?

1066
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,500
全英格兰
In England?

1067
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,697
你陷得很深  夏洛克
You're in deep, Sherlock,

1068
00:53:57,697 --> 00:53:59,718
比你预想的要深得多
deeper than you ever intended to be.

1069
00:53:59,854 --> 00:54:02,041
-你列清单了吗  -列些什么
- Have you made a list? - Of what?

1070
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:05,781
所有的  我们需要个清单
Everything. We will need a list.

1071
00:54:10,885 --> 00:54:12,166
好样的
Good boy.

1072
00:54:13,145 --> 00:54:15,968
不  我还没完事
No, I haven't finished yet.

1073
00:54:15,968 --> 00:54:18,479
莫里亚蒂可能不敢苟同
Moriarty may beg to differ.

1074
00:54:20,197 --> 00:54:24,416
他想让我分心  转移我的视线
He's trying to distract me. To derail me.

1075
00:54:24,614 --> 00:54:27,979
没错  他是镜片上的裂纹  药膏里的苍蝇
Yes. He's the crack in the lens, the fly in the ointment,

1076
00:54:28,312 --> 00:54:30,197
数据里的病毒
the virus in the data.

1077
00:54:34,052 --> 00:54:36,510
我必须完成
I have to finish this.

1078
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:41,406
如果莫里亚蒂从莱辛巴赫大锅里爬了出来
If Moriarty has risen from the Reichenbach cauldron,

1079
00:54:41,854 --> 00:54:43,541
他会找到你的
he will seek you out.

1080
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:45,916
那我等着
I'll be waiting.

1081
00:54:53,104 --> 00:54:54,406
是啊
Yes.

1082
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,145
恐怕你会的
I'm very much afraid you will.

1083
00:55:44,145 --> 00:55:46,645
他已经这样两天了
Two days he's been like that.

1084
00:55:47,406 --> 00:55:48,322
他吃东西了吗
Has he eaten?

1085
00:55:48,322 --> 00:55:50,270
没有  一口都没吃
No, not a morsel.

1086
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,520
媒体都乐疯了
Press are having a ruddy field day.

1087
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,000
外面还有记者蹲守
There's still reporters outside.

1088
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,572
他们一直在那里  我赶不走他们
Oh, they've been there all the time, I can't get rid of them.

1089
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:01,083
我一直忙着给他泡茶
I've been rushed off my feet making tea.

1090
00:56:01,479 --> 00:56:02,906
你为什么要给他泡茶
Why do you make him tea?

1091
00:56:03,979 --> 00:56:06,750
我不知道  我就这么做了
I dunno, I just sort of do.

1092
00:56:08,395 --> 00:56:11,218
他说"只有一个嫌疑人"  然后就走了
He said, "There's only one suspect," and then he just walks away

1093
00:56:11,218 --> 00:56:12,270
现在又不肯解释
and now he won't explain.

1094
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:15,145
这很奇怪  他最喜欢解释了
Which is strange, because he likes that bit.

1095
00:56:15,145 --> 00:56:17,270
他说这案子很简单  我都能解开
Said it was so simple I could solve it.

1096
00:56:18,427 --> 00:56:20,833
他肯定是在夸大其词
I'm sure he was exaggerating.

1097
00:56:23,197 --> 00:56:24,708
你觉得他在做什么
What's he doing, do you think?

1098
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:27,093
-他说他在等待  -等什么
- He says he's waiting. - For what?

1099
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,489
等魔鬼
The devil.

1100
00:56:29,906 --> 00:56:31,864
这可难说
I wouldn't be surprised.

1101
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:33,802
来这儿的什么人都有
We get all sorts here.

1102
00:56:35,093 --> 00:56:39,000
-有变化的话就给我发电报  -好的
- Well, wire me if there's any change. - Yeah.

1103
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,010
我要说的你都想到了吧
Everything I have to say has already crossed your mind.

1104
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:28,031
或许我的回答也已在你脑中浮现过
Then possibly my answer has crossed yours.

1105
00:57:28,531 --> 00:57:29,791
像颗子弹一样
Like a bullet.

1106
00:57:37,427 --> 00:57:38,885
这个习惯很危险
It's a dangerous habit,

1107
00:57:38,885 --> 00:57:43,000
摸着睡衣口袋里上膛的手枪
to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one's dressing gown.

1108
00:57:43,854 --> 00:57:46,218
还是你看到我太高兴了
Or are you just pleased to see me?

1109
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:53,083
请原谅我准备了些预防措施
You'll forgive me for taking precautions.

1110
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,760
你没准备的话我会生气的
I'd be offended if you didn't.

1111
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,333
当然  我也礼尚往来了
Obviously, I've returned the courtesy.

1112
00:58:06,979 --> 00:58:08,937
我喜欢你的房间
I like your rooms.

1113
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,635
散发着如此
They smell so...

1114
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,104
阳刚的气息
manly.

1115
00:58:16,062 --> 00:58:19,020
我相信你在此之前就来过了
I'm sure you acquainted yourself with them before now.

1116
00:58:19,031 --> 00:58:20,750
毕竟你总不在这里
Well, you are always away,

1117
00:58:20,781 --> 00:58:23,083
总在为《斯特兰德月刊》探险
on your little adventures for The Strand.

1118
00:58:23,312 --> 00:58:26,000
跟我说说  插画师和你一起出行吗
Tell me, does the illustrator travel with you?

1119
00:58:26,072 --> 00:58:29,656
你在推理的时候  要摆造型吗
Do you have to pose... during your deductions?

1120
00:58:29,666 --> 00:58:32,531
你六次趁我不在来拜访我的公寓
I'm aware of all six occasions you have visited these apartments

1121
00:58:32,531 --> 00:58:34,614
-我都发现了  -我知道
- during my absence. - I know you are.

1122
00:58:36,593 --> 00:58:39,958
顺便一提  你的床意外地舒服
By the way, you have a surprisingly comfortable bed.

1123
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,583
你知道灰尘主要由人的皮肤组成吗
Did you know that dust is largely composed of human skin?

1124
00:58:47,593 --> 00:58:48,791
知道
Yes.

1125
00:58:50,822 --> 00:58:53,322
不过味道不一样  皮肤还是新鲜的好
Doesn't taste the same, though, you want your skin fresh.

1126
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:56,166
-脆一点  -你不坐下吗
- Just a little crispy. - Won't you sit down?

1127
00:58:56,177 --> 00:58:57,979
人们本质上就是这样
That's all people really are, you know,

1128
00:58:58,281 --> 00:59:00,114
随时会飘散的灰尘
dust waiting to be distributed.

1129
00:59:00,114 --> 00:59:01,593
而且能飘散到各处
And it gets everywhere.

1130
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:04,895
在呼吸的每口气里  在每束阳光里跳动
In every breath you take, dancing in every sunbeam,

1131
00:59:04,895 --> 00:59:07,312
那些精疲力竭的人啊
all the used-up people.

1132
00:59:07,312 --> 00:59:09,104
引人入胜  你坐下吧
Fascinating, I'm sure. Won't you sit...

1133
00:59:09,104 --> 00:59:11,625
人啊  人啊  人啊
People, people, people!

1134
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:13,218
什么东西都要落灰
Can't keep anything shiny.

1135
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:17,041
你介意我开一枪吗
Do you mind if I fire this?

1136
00:59:17,635 --> 00:59:19,250
好清理下灰尘
Just to clean it out.

1137
00:59:36,843 --> 00:59:38,281
没错  我们别玩了
Exactly, let's stop playing.

1138
00:59:38,281 --> 00:59:39,968
我们要杀彼此不需要玩具
We don't need toys to kill each other.

1139
00:59:39,968 --> 00:59:42,729
-那样可不够亲密  -坐下
- Where's the intimacy in that? - Sit down.

1140
00:59:42,739 --> 00:59:44,937
-为什么  你想要什么  -你自己要来的
- Why? What do you want? - You chose to come here.

1141
00:59:44,937 --> 00:59:46,750
假话  你知道那是假话
Not true, you know that's not true.

1142
00:59:47,864 --> 00:59:49,135
你想要什么  夏洛克
What do you want, Sherlock?

1143
00:59:50,729 --> 00:59:51,760
真相
The truth.

1144
00:59:53,104 --> 00:59:56,270
那个啊  真相很无聊
That. Truth's boring!

1145
00:59:59,531 --> 01:00:00,614
你没料想到
You didn't expect me to

1146
01:00:00,614 --> 01:00:02,895
我会出现在犯罪现场  是吗
turn up at the scene of the crime, did you?

1147
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:06,739
可怜的尤斯塔斯爵士  他罪有应得
Poor old Sir Eustace. He got what was coming to him.

1148
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:08,083
但他不可能是你杀的
But you couldn't have killed him.

1149
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:12,010
那又怎样  这重要吗  够了  别这样
Oh, so what? Does it matter? Stop it. Stop this.

1150
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:14,645
你才不关心尤斯塔斯爵士  还有什么新娘
You don't care about Sir Eustace, or the Bride, or any of it.

1151
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:16,437
整个事件中只有一样
There's only one thing in this whole business

1152
01:00:16,437 --> 01:00:17,822
引起了你的注意
that you find interesting.

1153
01:00:18,229 --> 01:00:20,322
我知道你在干什么
I know what you're doing.

1154
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:24,406
新娘把枪口伸进嘴里
The Bride put a gun in her mouth

1155
01:00:24,406 --> 01:00:25,604
把自己的后脑勺打开了花
and shot the back of her head off

1156
01:00:25,614 --> 01:00:27,145
然后她复活了
and then she came back.

1157
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:32,052
不可能  但她做到了
Impossible. But she did it.

1158
01:00:32,572 --> 01:00:34,729
你想知道是怎么做到的
And you need to know how.

1159
01:00:35,281 --> 01:00:36,406
到底怎么回事
How?

1160
01:00:36,406 --> 01:00:37,302
对不对
Don't you?

1161
01:00:37,645 --> 01:00:39,968
因为不知道  你的世界都要崩溃了
It's tearing your world apart, not knowing.

1162
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,760
你想阻止我
You're trying to stop me...

1163
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:46,125
想让我分心  转移我的视线
To distract me, derail me.

1164
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:48,468
因为你是不是想起了另一个案子
Because doesn't this remind you of another case?

1165
01:00:49,427 --> 01:00:51,541
以前是不是发生过类似的事
Hasn't this all happened before?

1166
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:54,958
太阳底下无新事  到底是什么
There's nothing new under the sun. What was it?

1167
01:00:55,135 --> 01:00:57,500
是什么呢   是哪个案子
What was it? What was that case?

1168
01:00:58,593 --> 01:00:59,458
你记得吗
Do you remember?

1169
01:01:01,843 --> 01:01:04,760
就在嘴边了  就在嘴边了
It's on the tip of my tongue. It's on the tip of my tongue.

1170
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,333
就在我的嘴边
It's on the tip of my tongue.

1171
01:01:07,656 --> 01:01:09,197
就在...
It's on the tip...

1172
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,625
嘴边
..Of my tongue.

1173
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:22,166
为了赫德森太太的壁纸着想  我必须提醒你
For the sake of Mrs Hudson's wallpaper, I must remind you

1174
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:25,208
你的手指稍微动一下  你就会死
that one false move with your finger and you will be dead.

1175
01:01:27,552 --> 01:01:28,458
什么
I'm sorry?

1176
01:01:30,614 --> 01:01:35,000
死亡  是新的潮流
Dead...is the new sexy.

1177
01:01:44,562 --> 01:01:47,375
说真的  这么一来脑子挺清爽的
Well, I'll tell you what, that rather blows the cobwebs away.

1178
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,520
你怎么还活着
How can you be alive?

1179
01:01:49,531 --> 01:01:50,489
我看起来怎么样
How do I look?

1180
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,572
老实说  是不是很显眼
You can be honest, is it noticeable?

1181
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:03,239
你把脑袋打爆了  怎么可能活下来
You blew your own brains out, how could you survive?

1182
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:04,510
也许我该梳个大背头
Or maybe I could backcomb.

1183
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:06,395
我亲眼看到你死了
I saw you die.

1184
01:02:08,072 --> 01:02:10,270
为什么没死呢
Why aren't you dead?

1185
01:02:10,302 --> 01:02:13,406
因为丧命不是因为坠落  夏洛克
Because it's not the fall that kills you, Sherlock.

1186
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:17,739
你应该比别人更清楚  坠落不死人
Of all people, you should know that, it's not the fall,

1187
01:02:17,906 --> 01:02:19,895
从来如此
it's never the fall.

1188
01:02:21,843 --> 01:02:23,708
人是落地摔死的
It's the landing!

1189
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:41,302
我们落地了  先生
We've landed, sir.

1190
01:02:41,812 --> 01:02:42,802
我们落地了
We've landed.

1191
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:44,781
不不  现在不行  还不行
No, no, not now, not now!

1192
01:02:48,947 --> 01:02:50,729
现在不行  不行
Not now, not now.

1193
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:52,468
您的旅程还舒适吧  先生
I trust you had a pleasant flight, sir?

1194
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:54,343
嗯  这次流放的时间
Well, a somewhat shorter exile

1195
01:02:54,343 --> 01:02:55,697
没有我们想的长  弟弟
than we'd imagined, brother mine,

1196
01:02:55,697 --> 01:02:58,041
但考虑到你强迫症的程度  可能足够了
but probably adequate, given your levels of OCD.

1197
01:02:58,041 --> 01:02:59,375
-我得回去  -什么
- I have to go back! - What?

1198
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,281
我就快想出来了  就差一点点
I was...I was nearly there, I nearly had it!

1199
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:02,635
你到底在说什么
What on earth are you talking about?

1200
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:05,187
回哪里去  你都没飞多远
Go back where? You didn't get very far.

1201
01:03:05,187 --> 01:03:07,583
瑞克莱蒂和他的恐怖新娘  你们不明白吗
Ricoletti and his abominable wife! Don't you understand?!

1202
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,281
我们当然不明白  你说什么胡话呢  夏洛克
No, of course we don't, you're not making any sense, Sherlock.

1203
01:03:10,281 --> 01:03:13,229
是一个案子  一百年前很有名的案子
It was a case, a famous one from 100 years ago.

1204
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:14,781
存在我硬盘里
Lodged in my hard drive,

1205
01:03:14,781 --> 01:03:17,260
本来她应该死了  但又复活了
she seemed to be dead, but then she came back.

1206
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,291
什么  跟莫里亚蒂一样
What, like Moriarty?

1207
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:20,406
打爆了自己的脑袋  完全和莫里亚蒂一样
Shot herself in the head, exactly like Moriarty.

1208
01:03:20,406 --> 01:03:21,531
但你刚刚才知道
But you've only just been told.

1209
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:22,468
我们也是才发现
We've only just found out,

1210
01:03:22,468 --> 01:03:24,916
他出现在全国每一块电视屏幕上
he's on every TV screen in the country.

1211
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:28,104
是啊  怎么  麦考夫是五分钟前打的电话
Yes? So? It's been five minutes since Mycroft called.

1212
01:03:28,385 --> 01:03:30,447
你们有什么进展  你们做了什么
What progress have you made? What have you been doing?

1213
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:31,833
更重要的是  你做了什么
More to the point, what have YOU been doing?

1214
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:33,562
-我当然在思维殿堂了  -那当然
- I've been in my Mind Palace, of course. - Of course.

1215
01:03:33,562 --> 01:03:35,510
正在做思维实验  假设我在1895年
Running an experiment. How would I have solved the crime,

1216
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:40,072
-应该如何破案  -夏洛克啊
- if I'd been there in 1895? - Oh, Sherlock.

1217
01:03:40,072 --> 01:03:41,947
所有的细节都很清楚
I had all the details perfect.

1218
01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:44,781
我完全沉浸在里面  全身心的
I was there, all of it, everything. I was immersed.

1219
01:03:44,781 --> 01:03:45,645
当然了
Of course you were.

1220
01:03:45,645 --> 01:03:48,541
你在看约翰的博客  你们相遇的故事
You've been reading John's blog. The story of how you met.

1221
01:03:49,687 --> 01:03:52,010
有时候通过他的眼睛看我自己有好处
It helps me if I see myself through his eyes sometimes.

1222
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:53,322
那样我聪明多了
I'm so much cleverer.

1223
01:03:54,614 --> 01:03:56,208
你真以为有人会相信你的说法
Do you really think anyone is believing you?

1224
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,614
不  他可以做到  我见过
No, he can do this, I've seen it.

1225
01:03:57,614 --> 01:04:00,083
思维殿堂  大脑中有整个世界
The Mind Palace, it's like a whole world in his head.

1226
01:04:00,093 --> 01:04:01,750
是的  我需要再回去
Yes, and I need to get back there.

1227
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:05,635
思维殿堂是一种记忆手段  我知道它的功用
The Mind Palace is a memory technique, I know what it can do

1228
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:08,343
也知道它的局限
and I know what it most certainly cannot.

1229
01:04:08,854 --> 01:04:13,093
也许有那么一两件事  我知道而你不知道
Maybe there are one or two things that I know that you don't.

1230
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,708
当然有了
Oh, there are.

1231
01:04:15,739 --> 01:04:17,145
你列了清单吗
Did you make a list?

1232
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
你又胖了
You've put on weight.

1233
01:04:22,031 --> 01:04:23,531
马甲显然比外套新
That waistcoat is clearly newer than the jacket.

1234
01:04:23,531 --> 01:04:26,166
-别说了  你列清单了吗  -什么清单
- Stop this! Just stop it! Did you make a list?! - Of what?

1235
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:28,291
所有的  夏洛克  你服的所有药物
Everything, Sherlock. Everything you've taken.

1236
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:30,270
不  不是那样  他就是出神了
No, it's not that, he goes into a sort of trance.

1237
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:31,250
我见过他那样做
I've seen him do it.

1238
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:45,312
从那天起  弟弟和我达成了协议
We have an agreement, my brother and I, ever since that day.

1239
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:49,781
不管在哪里找到他
Wherever I find him,

1240
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,479
背街小巷也好  小客栈也罢
whatever back alley or doss-house...

1241
01:04:54,729 --> 01:04:56,552
一定要有张清单
..There will always be a list.

1242
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,437
他不可能在五分钟内服这么多
He couldn't have taken all that in the last five minutes.

1243
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:02,541
他上飞机前就嗨了
He was high before he got on the plane.

1244
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:04,010
看起来不像
He didn't seem high.

1245
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:06,656
瘾君子最能骗人
Nobody deceives like an addict.

1246
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:08,489
我不是瘾君子  我只是服用药物
I'm not an addict, I'm a user.

1247
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:10,312
减缓我无聊的情绪
I alleviate boredom and

1248
01:05:10,312 --> 01:05:12,895
或者偶尔提高我的思考效率
occasionally heighten my thought processes.

1249
01:05:12,895 --> 01:05:14,708
老天  这可能要了你的命
For God's sake! This could kill you!

1250
01:05:14,708 --> 01:05:17,770
-你可能会死  -控制剂量就不会致命
- You could die! - Controlled usage is not usually fatal

1251
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:20,312
节制的生活也不能永生
and abstinence is not immortality.

1252
01:05:20,312 --> 01:05:21,281
你在做什么
What are you doing?

1253
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:23,166
艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂  我在搜她
Emelia Ricoletti, I'm looking her up.

1254
01:05:23,864 --> 01:05:25,375
好吧  也许是应该看看
Oh, I suppose we should.

1255
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:28,510
我有权查询军情五处的最高机密资料库
I have access to the top level of the MI5 archive.

1256
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:30,145
对  我正在那儿搜索
Yep, that's where I'm looking.

1257
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:34,250
你认为军情五处的防火墙怎么样
What do you think of MI5 security?

1258
01:05:35,093 --> 01:05:37,375
弄一个也挺好的
I think it would be a good idea.

1259
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:40,562
艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂  "悬案"
Emelia Ricoletti, "Unsolved",

1260
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:41,833
跟他说的一样
like he says.

1261
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:43,562
你们能不能闭嘴五分钟
Could you all just shut up for five minutes!

1262
01:05:43,562 --> 01:05:44,802
我必须回去
I have to go back.

1263
01:05:44,989 --> 01:05:45,750
我就快破案了
I was nearly there before

1264
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,666
结果让你们跑进来吵没了
you stepped on and started yapping away!

1265
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:50,250
吵  抱歉  我们是打扰你治疗了吗
"Yapping?" Sorry, did we interrupt your session?

1266
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:51,677
夏洛克  听我说
Sherlock, listen to me.

1267
01:05:51,677 --> 01:05:53,156
不想听  你越说越来劲
No, it only encourages you.

1268
01:05:53,156 --> 01:05:55,281
-我没生你的气  -我真松了口气啊
- I'm not angry with you. - Oh, that's a relief!

1269
01:05:55,281 --> 01:05:57,802
我本来还一直担心呢  不  等等
I was really worried... No, hold on,

1270
01:05:57,802 --> 01:05:58,937
我真没担心
I really wasn't.

1271
01:06:00,093 --> 01:06:01,687
我以前救过你
I was there for you before.

1272
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,010
下一次我还会救你
I'll be there for you again.

1273
01:06:06,406 --> 01:06:08,218
不论多少次我都会救你
I'll always be there for you.

1274
01:06:10,489 --> 01:06:11,770
这是我的错
This was my fault.

1275
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:14,406
这与你无关
It was nothing to do with you.

1276
01:06:15,218 --> 01:06:16,458
入狱一周
A week in a prison cell,

1277
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:18,437
-我该意识到的  -意识到什么
- I should have realised. - Realised what?

1278
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:19,593
对你来说
That, in your case,

1279
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:23,010
单独监禁其实是和死敌关在一起
solitary confinement is locking you up with your worst enemy.

1280
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:24,468
我的神啊
Oh, for God's sake!

1281
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:26,010
吗啡还是可卡因
Morphine or cocaine?

1282
01:06:28,729 --> 01:06:29,843
你说什么
What did you say?

1283
01:06:30,343 --> 01:06:31,520
我什么也没说
I didn't say anything.

1284
01:06:31,802 --> 01:06:33,000
不  你说了  你说
No, you did, you said...

1285
01:06:33,802 --> 01:06:36,406
今天是什么  吗啡还是可卡因
Which is it today? Morphine or cocaine.

1286
01:06:39,572 --> 01:06:40,406
福尔摩斯
'Holmes?'

1287
01:06:40,572 --> 01:06:42,989
吗啡还是可卡因  今天是什么
Morphine or cocaine - which is it today?

1288
01:06:43,843 --> 01:06:45,364
回答我  该死的
Answer me, damn it!

1289
01:06:47,052 --> 01:06:48,531
莫里亚蒂来过
Moriarty was here.

1290
01:06:49,562 --> 01:06:50,666
莫里亚蒂死了
Moriarty's dead.

1291
01:06:53,604 --> 01:06:54,989
我刚刚在飞机上
I was on a jet.

1292
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:56,697
什么上
A what?

1293
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,625
你也在  还有麦考夫
You were there, and Mycroft.

1294
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:01,593
你就没出过门  福尔摩斯
You haven't left these rooms, Holmes.

1295
01:07:02,781 --> 01:07:05,656
连动都没动一下
You...haven't...moved.

1296
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:08,583
告诉我  是吗啡还是可卡因
Now, tell me, morphine or cocaine?

1297
01:07:10,156 --> 01:07:13,416
可卡因  7%的
Cocaine. A 7% solution.

1298
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:15,895
-想来点吗  -不想
- Would you care to try it? - No.

1299
01:07:16,177 --> 01:07:18,364
但我十分想把这儿所有的
But I would quite like to find every ounce of the stuff

1300
01:07:18,364 --> 01:07:20,229
这破玩意儿都找到然后倒窗外
in your possession and pour it out of the window.

1301
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:22,375
那我会想阻止你
I should be inclined to stop you.

1302
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:25,385
那我将用强有力的方式提醒你
Then you would be reminded, quite forcibly,

1303
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,687
我们两个中谁是军人  谁是瘾君子
which of us is a soldier and which of us a drug addict.

1304
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:31,114
你不是军人  你是个医生
You're not a soldier, you are a doctor.

1305
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:32,614
我是个军医  也就是说我可以
I'm an army doctor, which means I could break

1306
01:07:32,614 --> 01:07:34,979
在掰断你每一根骨头时顺便叫出它的学名
every bone in your body while naming them.

1307
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:39,625
亲爱的华生  你的感情干扰了你的判断
My dear Watson, you are allowing emotion to cloud your judgment.

1308
01:07:39,635 --> 01:07:40,750
办案不吸毒
Never on a case.

1309
01:07:41,656 --> 01:07:43,385
你保证过的  办案不吸毒
You promised me, never on a case.

1310
01:07:43,385 --> 01:07:45,083
不  那是出自
No, I just said that

1311
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:46,645
-你的一篇故事  -听着
- in one of your stories. - Listen,

1312
01:07:47,552 --> 01:07:49,718
我很乐意为你扮演捧哏
I'm happy to play the fool for you.

1313
01:07:49,802 --> 01:07:52,687
我可以笨蛋一样跟着你到处跑
I will run along behind you like some halfwit,

1314
01:07:52,687 --> 01:07:54,562
衬托出你的聪明  如果你需要如此
making you look clever, if that's what you need.

1315
01:07:54,562 --> 01:07:56,416
但看在上帝分上
But dear God above,

1316
01:07:56,562 --> 01:07:59,791
你得给自己定个更高的标准
you will hold yourself to a higher standard!

1317
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:02,020
-为什么  -因为人们需要你
- Why? - Because people need you to.

1318
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:04,208
什么人  为什么  就因为你的蠢故事
What people, why? Because of your idiot stories?

1319
01:08:04,208 --> 01:08:06,760
没错  就因为我的蠢故事
Yes, because of my "Idiot stories".

1320
01:08:06,947 --> 01:08:08,135
福尔摩斯先生
Mr Holmes!

1321
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,781
福尔摩斯先生  电报  福尔摩斯先生
Mr Holmes, telegram, Mr Holmes.

1322
01:08:20,427 --> 01:08:21,677
怎么了  出什么事了
What is it? What's wrong?

1323
01:08:22,677 --> 01:08:25,208
-是玛丽  -玛丽  她怎么了
- It's Mary. - Mary? What about her?

1324
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:27,447
-她很有可能陷入了危险  -危险
- It's entirely possible she's in danger. - Danger?

1325
01:08:27,447 --> 01:08:28,812
一刻也不能耽误了
There's not a moment to lose.

1326
01:08:29,468 --> 01:08:31,479
这是你吸毒的幻觉吗
Is this the cocaine talking?

1327
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,125
玛丽能有什么危险
What danger could Mary be in?

1328
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:36,229
-她肯定只是去拜访朋友了  -快走
- I'm sure she's just visiting with friends. - Come on!

1329
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:43,500
到底怎么了
What is happening?

1330
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:45,437
你这状况真的可以吗
Are you even in a fit state?

1331
01:08:45,927 --> 01:08:48,552
为玛丽当然可以  这毋庸置疑  华生
For Mary, of course. Never doubt that, Watson.

1332
01:08:49,614 --> 01:08:50,666
毋庸置疑
Never that.

1333
01:08:51,864 --> 01:08:52,770
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

1334
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,187
我没事  我没事
I'm fine. I'm fine!

1335
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:57,437
别戴那顶
Not that one!

1336
01:08:58,781 --> 01:08:59,614
戴这顶
This one.

1337
01:09:00,635 --> 01:09:02,260
-为什么  -你是夏洛克・福尔摩斯
- Why? - You're Sherlock Holmes.

1338
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:03,468
戴你该戴的帽子吧
Wear the damn hat.

1339
01:09:10,822 --> 01:09:13,062
出租马车  马车
Cab! Cab!

1340
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:17,927
说吧  她在哪
So tell me, where is she?

1341
01:09:18,635 --> 01:09:20,822
告诉我  到底是怎么回事
You must tell me, what's going on?!

1342
01:09:20,822 --> 01:09:21,927
我的好华生啊
Oh, good old Watson!

1343
01:09:21,927 --> 01:09:24,416
你不问问题我们这些闲暇时间该怎么过啊
How would we fill the time if you didn't ask questions?!

1344
01:09:24,416 --> 01:09:27,104
夏洛克  快告诉我  我妻子在哪
Sherlock, tell me where my bloody wife is,

1345
01:09:27,104 --> 01:09:28,156
你这个自大的混蛋
you pompous prick,

1346
01:09:28,156 --> 01:09:29,750
否则我真跟你动手
or I'll punch your lights out!

1347
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,864
福尔摩斯  她在哪
Holmes, where is she?

1348
01:09:34,781 --> 01:09:36,364
一个废弃教堂
A de-sanctified church.

1349
01:09:36,364 --> 01:09:37,885
她觉得她找到了答案
She thinks she's found the solution and,

1350
01:09:37,885 --> 01:09:39,062
也正因此
for no better reason than that,

1351
01:09:39,062 --> 01:09:41,562
她让自己陷入了巨大的危险
she's put herself in the path of considerable danger.

1352
01:09:42,135 --> 01:09:43,760
这妻子真是选的好啊
What an excellent choice of wife.

1353
01:09:56,802 --> 01:09:58,010
搞什么
What the devil?!

1354
01:09:58,093 --> 01:09:59,218
我找到他们了
I've found them.

1355
01:10:08,177 --> 01:10:09,145
这是什么啊  玛丽
What is all this, Mary?

1356
01:10:09,145 --> 01:10:11,354
是一切的核心  约翰
This is the heart of it all, John.

1357
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,062
阴谋的核心
The heart of the conspiracy.

1358
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,291
神啊  这是什么地方啊
Great God, what is this place?

1359
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:38,708
而且你又来这儿干什么
And what the devil are you doing here?!

1360
01:10:38,708 --> 01:10:40,614
我一直在调查
I've been making enquiries.

1361
01:10:41,156 --> 01:10:42,947
应福尔摩斯先生之请
Mr Holmes asked me.

1362
01:10:43,052 --> 01:10:44,156
福尔摩斯  你怎么能这么做
Holmes, how could you?

1363
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:46,270
不  不是他  聪明的那位
No, not him, the clever one.

1364
01:10:46,906 --> 01:10:47,916
我认为很明显
It seemed obvious to me

1365
01:10:47,916 --> 01:10:50,427
这件事一个人无法完成
that this business could not be managed alone.

1366
01:10:50,427 --> 01:10:53,312
我认为瑞克莱蒂太太有帮手
My theory is that Mrs Ricoletti had help.

1367
01:10:53,312 --> 01:10:54,770
她的朋友
Help from her friends.

1368
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:57,625
-漂亮  玛丽  "聪明的那位"  -我
- Bravo, Mary. "The clever one?" - I...

1369
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:00,083
我以为我要失去你了
I thought I was losing you.

1370
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,104
我以为我们
I thought perhaps we were...

1371
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:05,864
-在冷战  -是你先搬出去的
- neglecting each other. - Well, you're the one who moved out.

1372
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:08,020
我是在跟玛丽说话
I was talking to Mary.

1373
01:11:09,114 --> 01:11:10,635
你怎么为麦考夫办事了
You're working for Mycroft?

1374
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:12,916
他想监督他的疯弟弟
He likes to keep an eye on his mad sibling.

1375
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:15,447
而且手头正好有间谍  你从来没发现
And he had a spy to hand. Has it never occurred to you

1376
01:11:15,447 --> 01:11:17,541
你妻子的能力远超普通护士吗
your wife is excessively skilled for a nurse?

1377
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:18,572
他当然没发现
Of course it hasn't,

1378
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,197
因为他知道护士该有的能力
because he knows what a nurse is capable of.

1379
01:11:21,218 --> 01:11:22,427
你又是什么时候发现的
When did it occur to you?

1380
01:11:22,427 --> 01:11:23,739
刚发现  不好意思
Only now, I'm afraid.

1381
01:11:23,791 --> 01:11:25,250
肯定很痛苦吧
Must be difficult,

1382
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,208
当天才的笨弟弟
being the slow little brother.

1383
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,697
也该跟上节奏了  聊够了  办正事
Time I sped up. Enough chatter, let's concentrate.

1384
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:32,625
好吧  这是干什么
Yes, all right. What's all this about?

1385
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,562
他们想做什么
What do they want to accomplish?

1386
01:11:34,562 --> 01:11:36,177
进去弄个明白吧
Why don't we go and find out.

1387
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,583
抱歉  见到锣不敲就难受
Sorry! I can never resist a gong.

1388
01:11:57,583 --> 01:12:00,031
-少了戏剧性也难受  -谁能想到呢
- Or a touch of the dramatic. - Never have guessed!

1389
01:12:00,614 --> 01:12:03,822
你们好像跟我一样  喜欢戏剧性
Though it seems you share my enthusiasm in that regard.

1390
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,635
真棒
Excellent.

1391
01:12:07,187 --> 01:12:08,937
一流的剧场
Superlative theatre.

1392
01:12:09,697 --> 01:12:12,072
场面令人赞叹
I applaud the spectacle.

1393
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,791
艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂饮弹自尽
Emelia Ricoletti shot herself,

1394
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:20,458
然后起死回生  杀死了她丈夫
then apparently returned from the grave and killed her husband.

1395
01:12:20,864 --> 01:12:21,822
那么...
So...

1396
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:23,927
是怎么回事呢
how was it done?

1397
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:26,906
按时间顺序回顾一下吧
Let's take the events in order.

1398
01:12:29,958 --> 01:12:31,989
瑞克莱蒂太太用最快的速度
Mrs. Ricoletti gets everyone's attention

1399
01:12:31,989 --> 01:12:34,104
-吸引了所有人的注意力  -你
- in very efficient fashion. - You!

1400
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:38,156
你
You?!

1401
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,843
还是我
Or me?

1402
01:12:40,843 --> 01:12:42,833
她把一把枪塞进嘴里
She places one of the revolvers in her mouth,

1403
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,958
开火的却是枪口朝下的另一把枪
while actually firing the other into the ground.

1404
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:47,062
她的同谋向窗帘上喷血
An accomplice sprays the curtains with blood

1405
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:48,406
这样楼下惊慌失措的民众
and thus her apparent suicide

1406
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:50,822
就都看到了她自杀的景象
is witnessed by the frightened crowd below.

1407
01:12:52,729 --> 01:12:53,614
另找一具
A substitute corpse,

1408
01:12:53,614 --> 01:12:55,625
跟瑞克莱蒂太太非常相似的尸体
bearing a strong resemblance to Mrs. Ricoletti

1409
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:58,156
来代替她  稍后被送进停尸房
takes her place and is later transported to the morgue,

1410
01:12:58,156 --> 01:13:01,677
这种自杀的小案子苏格兰场也没什么兴趣
a grubby little suicide of little interest to Scotland Yard.

1411
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:05,885
同时真的瑞克莱蒂太太悄悄溜走
Meanwhile, the real Mrs. Ricoletti slips away.

1412
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:12,385
真正聪明的是这步
Now comes the really clever part.

1413
01:13:12,385 --> 01:13:15,437
瑞克莱蒂太太说服一位认识她的马车夫
Mrs. Ricoletti persuaded a cab driver, someone who knew her,

1414
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:18,583
拉她去丈夫最喜欢的鸦片馆外等他
to intercept her husband outside his favourite opium den.

1415
01:13:18,989 --> 01:13:22,031
完美的舞台  完美的一出戏
The perfect stage for a perfect drama.

1416
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:24,104
你是谁  你要干什么
Who are you? What do you want?

1417
01:13:26,666 --> 01:13:27,541
艾米丽娅
Emelia?

1418
01:13:28,645 --> 01:13:29,177
救命
Help!

1419
01:13:29,177 --> 01:13:31,375
身份得到完全确认
A perfect positive identification.

1420
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:33,864
已故的瑞克莱蒂太太起死回生
The late Mrs. Ricoletti has returned from the grave

1421
01:13:33,864 --> 01:13:36,020
加上化妆师的手笔
and a little skilled make-up

1422
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:39,177
写就了一出怨灵复仇的戏码
and you have nothing less than the wrath of a vengeful ghost.

1423
01:13:52,385 --> 01:13:54,552
还剩最后一件事
There was only one thing left to do.

1424
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:57,781
快点  别落泪
Swiftly now. No tears.

1425
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,395
最后一步就是把真的瑞克莱蒂太太
All that remained was to substitute the real Mrs. Ricoletti

1426
01:14:04,395 --> 01:14:05,812
跟假尸体掉包
for the corpse in the morgue.

1427
01:14:05,812 --> 01:14:08,604
这次再有人来验尸
This time, should anyone attempt to identify her,

1428
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:11,916
就能确认的确是她
it would be positively, absolutely her.

1429
01:14:11,916 --> 01:14:13,447
但她为什么要这样
But why would she do that?

1430
01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:15,406
用死来证明什么
Die to prove a point?

1431
01:14:15,406 --> 01:14:17,364
大业都需要殉道者
Every great cause has martyrs.

1432
01:14:17,822 --> 01:14:22,187
战争也都需要献身  没错  这就是战争
Every war has suicide missions and make no mistake, this is war.

1433
01:14:22,531 --> 01:14:25,312
半边天向另一半宣战
One half of the human race at war with the other.

1434
01:14:26,697 --> 01:14:29,937
这支常伴身边的无形军队
The invisible army hovering at our elbow,

1435
01:14:30,416 --> 01:14:31,989
打理家事
tending to our homes,

1436
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,072
养育孩子
raising our children.

1437
01:14:34,968 --> 01:14:37,906
没人注意  不受重视
Ignored, patronised,

1438
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,666
被人忽略
disregarded.

1439
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:43,885
投一票的权利都没有
Not allowed so much as a vote.

1440
01:14:52,135 --> 01:14:53,947
但依然是支军队
But an army nonetheless,

1441
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,937
准备为崇高的事业而战
ready to rise up in the best of causes.

1442
01:14:57,604 --> 01:15:02,197
反抗由来已久的不平等
To put right an injustice as old as humanity itself.

1443
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:06,843
所以  华生  麦考夫说对了
So you see, Watson, Mycroft was right.

1444
01:15:07,239 --> 01:15:09,052
这场战争我们必须输
This is a war we must lose.

1445
01:15:09,052 --> 01:15:10,885
她要死了
She was dying.

1446
01:15:11,979 --> 01:15:14,083
-谁  -艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂
- Who was? - Emelia Ricoletti.

1447
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:15,947
能看出明显的肺痨症状
There were clear signs of consumption -

1448
01:15:15,947 --> 01:15:18,739
她应该是活不长了
I doubt she was long for this world.

1449
01:15:18,854 --> 01:15:21,604
所以她想死得有意义点
So she decided to make her death count.

1450
01:15:23,437 --> 01:15:26,479
她已经跟美国的秘密社团很熟悉了
She was already familiar with the secret societies of America.

1451
01:15:26,697 --> 01:15:28,510
还使用了她们那套恐怖
And was able to draw on their methods of fear

1452
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:30,833
威胁的手法  在非常公开的场合下
and intimidation to publicly, very publicly,

1453
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:34,333
跟尤斯塔斯・卡迈克爵士对峙他过去的罪行
confront Sir Eustace Carmichael with the sins of his past.

1454
01:15:34,406 --> 01:15:36,333
他在美国就结识了她
He knew her out in the States.

1455
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:39,843
给她许诺了一切
Promised her everything.

1456
01:15:40,406 --> 01:15:42,864
婚姻  地位
Marriage, position.

1457
01:15:44,906 --> 01:15:47,010
然后玩弄过她...
And then he had his way with her...

1458
01:15:48,312 --> 01:15:49,781
就抛弃了她
..and threw her over.

1459
01:15:50,447 --> 01:15:52,760
丢下身无分文的她
Left her abandoned and penniless.

1460
01:15:53,354 --> 01:15:54,291
霍普
Hooper!

1461
01:16:00,281 --> 01:16:01,197
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

1462
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:06,583
正式声明  福尔摩斯  她可没瞒过我
For the record, Holmes, she didn't have me fooled.

1463
01:16:10,583 --> 01:16:12,468
您为什么从不提我  先生
Why do you never mention me, sir?

1464
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:19,406
艾米丽娅以为跟瑞克莱蒂会幸福
Emelia thought that she'd found happiness with Ricoletti,

1465
01:16:20,145 --> 01:16:22,666
但他也是个畜生
but he was a brute too.

1466
01:16:28,864 --> 01:16:31,343
艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂是我们的朋友
Emelia Ricoletti was our friend.

1467
01:16:31,822 --> 01:16:34,635
你不知道那个混账是怎么对她的
You have no idea how that bastard treated her.

1468
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:39,625
可是新娘  福尔摩斯  我们看到她了
But the Bride, Holmes, we saw her.

1469
01:16:40,031 --> 01:16:41,593
是啊  华生  看到了
Yes, Watson, we did.

1470
01:16:42,447 --> 01:16:44,052
打碎镜子的声音
The sound of breaking glass?

1471
01:16:44,489 --> 01:16:45,541
碎的不是窗户
Not a window,

1472
01:16:46,177 --> 01:16:48,583
不过是个剧院的老把戏
just an old theatrical trick.

1473
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:50,656
这不可能  福尔摩斯  不可能
It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot!

1474
01:16:50,656 --> 01:16:51,979
是不可能
No, it can't.

1475
01:16:52,104 --> 01:16:55,135
叫做佩珀尔幻象
'It's called Pepper's Ghost.

1476
01:16:55,687 --> 01:16:58,437
一个活人
'A simple reflection in glass

1477
01:16:58,437 --> 01:17:00,937
在玻璃镜的倒影
of a living, breathing person.

1478
01:17:01,354 --> 01:17:05,416
只是她们搬玻璃镜时  把它给弄碎了
'Their only mistake was breaking the glass when they removed it.'

1479
01:17:07,812 --> 01:17:08,864
看看四周
Look around you.

1480
01:17:10,072 --> 01:17:12,510
这屋里都是新娘
This room is full of brides.

1481
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:19,781
她站了起来
Once she had risen,

1482
01:17:20,666 --> 01:17:21,989
可能成为任何人
anyone could be her.

1483
01:17:23,937 --> 01:17:26,072
复仇的鬼魂
The avenging ghost.

1484
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:29,187
一个传说  令心怀不轨的男人
A legend to strike terror into the heart of any man

1485
01:17:29,187 --> 01:17:30,979
恐惧战栗
with malicious intent.

1486
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:32,583
纠缠不休的鬼魂
A spectre to stalk those

1487
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:36,625
与犯下罪孽却未遭惩戒的人清算过去
unpunished brutes whose reckoning is long overdue.

1488
01:17:37,093 --> 01:17:39,666
一支愤怒军团觉醒了
A league of furies awakened.

1489
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:41,572
那位我...
The women I...

1490
01:17:42,093 --> 01:17:45,281
我们欺骗过  背叛过的女人
WE have lied to, betrayed.

1491
01:17:46,812 --> 01:17:50,406
我们忽略过  蔑视过的女人
The women we have ignored and disparaged.

1492
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,885
一旦产生了这种想法
Once the idea exists,

1493
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,031
就难以消除了
it cannot be killed.

1494
01:18:03,197 --> 01:18:05,562
想出这个主意的人意志坚定
This is the work of a single-minded person.

1495
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:10,177
并且非常了解尤斯塔斯爵士的精神虐待
Someone who knew first-hand about Sir Eustace's mental cruelty.

1496
01:18:10,729 --> 01:18:12,291
阴暗的秘密
The dark secret,

1497
01:18:13,093 --> 01:18:15,395
只告诉了她最好的朋友
kept from all but her closest friends,

1498
01:18:15,395 --> 01:18:17,833
包括艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂
including Emelia Ricoletti...

1499
01:18:18,354 --> 01:18:22,291
那个多年之前遭她丈夫亏待的女人
..the woman her husband wronged all those years before.

1500
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:25,677
如果排除鬼魂
If one disregards the ghost,

1501
01:18:26,072 --> 01:18:28,406
就只剩一个嫌疑人
there is only one suspect.

1502
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:32,083
是不是  卡迈克夫人
Isn't that right, Lady Carmichael?

1503
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:37,822
但是有一个小地方我不太明白
One small detail doesn't quite make sense to me, however.

1504
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,875
为什么要找我阻止一桩
Why engage me to prevent a murder

1505
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:45,104
你打算实施的谋杀
you intended to commit?

1506
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:49,333
不太明白
"Doesn't quite make sense,

1507
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:50,322
不太明白
doesn't quite make sense."

1508
01:18:50,322 --> 01:18:53,187
你当然明白不了  这不是真的
Of course it doesn't make sense, it's not real.

1509
01:18:54,302 --> 01:18:55,968
夏洛克啊
Oh, Sherlock.

1510
01:18:58,916 --> 01:18:59,864
躲躲猫
Peek-a-boo.

1511
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:01,833
不
No.

1512
01:19:02,906 --> 01:19:04,822
不  不是你
No, not you.

1513
01:19:06,406 --> 01:19:07,604
不可能是你
It can't be you.

1514
01:19:07,729 --> 01:19:09,927
得了  好好想想
I mean, come on, be serious.

1515
01:19:10,052 --> 01:19:12,322
扮装  锣
The costumes, the gong?

1516
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:14,562
作为犯罪大师
Speaking as a criminal mastermind,

1517
01:19:14,562 --> 01:19:18,625
我得说我们可不会用锣  或是扮装
we don't really have gongs or special outfits.

1518
01:19:19,562 --> 01:19:21,197
这是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

1519
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:24,937
这对你来说够蠢了吗
Is this silly enough for you yet?

1520
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:29,177
够哥特了吗  够疯狂了吗  即使对你而言
Gothic enough? Mad enough, even for you?

1521
01:19:29,437 --> 01:19:31,364
你不明白  夏洛克
It doesn't make sense, Sherlock,

1522
01:19:31,916 --> 01:19:33,479
因为这不是真的
because it's not real.

1523
01:19:34,104 --> 01:19:36,270
-都不是真的  -他在说什么
- None of it. - What's he talking about?

1524
01:19:37,156 --> 01:19:38,843
这都是你自己在瞎想
This is all in your mind.

1525
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:41,593
夏洛克
Sherlock?

1526
01:19:42,697 --> 01:19:43,625
福尔摩斯
Holmes!

1527
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:45,739
你在做梦
You're dreaming.

1528
01:19:47,072 --> 01:19:48,104
他是在做梦吗
Is he dreaming?

1529
01:19:50,072 --> 01:19:51,750
他醒了
And there he is.

1530
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:53,406
还以为你已经去了
Thought we'd lost you for a moment.

1531
01:19:53,406 --> 01:19:56,625
我问一下  这就是你说的"控制剂量"吗
May I just check, is this what you mean by "controlled usage"?

1532
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:59,781
艾米丽娅・瑞克莱蒂太太  告诉我她埋在哪
Mrs Emelia Ricoletti, I need to know where she was buried.

1533
01:19:59,781 --> 01:20:03,072
-你是说120年前吗  -是的
- What, 120 years ago? - Yes.

1534
01:20:03,468 --> 01:20:06,583
那要找上几周才能找到  前提是有记录
That would take weeks to find, if those records even exists.

1535
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:09,145
-即使借用我的资源  -查到了
- Even with my resources. - Got it.

1536
01:20:11,729 --> 01:20:13,260
我不明白  和这有什么关系
I don't get it, how is this relevant?

1537
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,343
我得先知道我是对的  然后我才能肯定
I need to know I was right, then I'll be sure.

1538
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:17,156
-你是说莫里亚蒂怎么做到的  -没错
- You mean how Moriarty did it? - Yes.

1539
01:20:17,156 --> 01:20:19,062
但那些并没有发生  都是你自己想的
But none of that really happened, it was in your head.

1540
01:20:19,062 --> 01:20:20,708
我的调查是想象的
My investigation was the fantasy,

1541
01:20:20,708 --> 01:20:22,458
但犯罪方式就如我刚刚所说的那样
the crime happened exactly as I explained.

1542
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:24,541
她的墓碑是她的一群朋友给她立的
The stone was erected by a group of her friends.

1543
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:27,520
-我不知道你想在这儿找到什么  -我得试试
- I don't know what you think you'll find here. - I need to try!

1544
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:37,750
瑞克莱蒂太太埋在这里
Mrs Ricoletti was buried here,

1545
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,822
但是另外一具尸体呢
but what happened to the other one?

1546
01:20:38,822 --> 01:20:41,927
在所谓的自杀之后用来替换她的那具尸体
The corpse they substituted for her after the so-called suicide?

1547
01:20:41,927 --> 01:20:44,354
-他们肯定给移走了  -移去哪了
- They'd move it, of course they would. - But where?

1548
01:20:44,354 --> 01:20:45,437
不在这里
Well, not here.

1549
01:20:45,614 --> 01:20:47,979
但是  他们肯定会这么做
But that... that's exactly what they must have done.

1550
01:20:47,979 --> 01:20:49,854
同谋有内应
The conspirators had someone on the inside.

1551
01:20:49,854 --> 01:20:50,500
他们找到一具尸体
They found a body,

1552
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:52,552
就像茉莉・霍普给我找了具尸体
just like Molly Hooper found a body for me, when...

1553
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,875
这不需要再说了  对吧
Yeah, well, we don't need to go into all that again, do we?

1554
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:57,468
你不会真的想这么做吧
You're not seriously going to do this?

1555
01:20:57,468 --> 01:21:00,114
我们正是为此而来  我必须知道
It's why we came here. I need to know.

1556
01:21:00,114 --> 01:21:01,604
真是瘾君子的口气
Spoken like an addict.

1557
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:02,822
这对我来说很重要
This is important to me!

1558
01:21:02,822 --> 01:21:04,572
不  你这是在嗑药
No, this is you needing a fix.

1559
01:21:04,572 --> 01:21:05,947
-约翰  -莫里亚蒂回来了
- John... - Moriarty's back.

1560
01:21:05,947 --> 01:21:08,739
我们有案子要解决  我们有现实问题
We have a case, we have a real-life problem right now.

1561
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:10,343
我下一个就解决它  就快了
Getting to that, it's next on the list.

1562
01:21:10,343 --> 01:21:11,093
我要先把这事做了
Just let me do this.

1563
01:21:11,104 --> 01:21:13,104
不  我们总是让你为所欲为
No, everyone always lets you do whatever you want.

1564
01:21:13,104 --> 01:21:15,197
-所以你才落得这个样子  -约翰  求你了
- That's how you got in this state! - John, please...

1565
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:17,875
我这次不会陪你玩了  夏洛克  别想了
I'm not playing this time, Sherlock. Not any more!

1566
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:20,864
你什么时候准备好工作了  给我打电话
When you're ready to go to work, give me a call.

1567
01:21:21,093 --> 01:21:22,593
-我要带玛丽回家了  -你要什么
- I'm taking Mary home. - You're what?

1568
01:21:22,593 --> 01:21:24,197
-玛丽要带我回家了  -这还差不多
- Mary's taking me home. - Better.

1569
01:21:26,947 --> 01:21:28,302
-他是对的  你知道  -对又怎么样
- He's right, you know. - So what if he's right?!

1570
01:21:28,302 --> 01:21:30,125
他总是对的  很无聊
He's always right, it's boring!

1571
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:34,312
你能帮我吗
Will you help me?

1572
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:40,395
{\an3}法国谚语
原意是如果一个男人行为怪异
就"去找到在与他偷情的女人吧"

1573
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:40,395
找到这个女人吧
Cherchez la femme.

1574
01:22:26,416 --> 01:22:27,479
上帝啊
Oh, dear.

1575
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:29,833
不在里面
The cupboard is bare.

1576
01:22:31,885 --> 01:22:33,437
肯定埋在下面了
They must have buried it underneath.

1577
01:22:34,062 --> 01:22:36,343
肯定埋在棺材下面了
They must have buried it underneath the coffin.

1578
01:22:51,281 --> 01:22:52,781
不走运  夏洛克
Bad luck, Sherlock.

1579
01:22:55,031 --> 01:22:57,145
也许他们用其他方式处理了尸体
Maybe they got rid of the body in another way.

1580
01:22:57,145 --> 01:22:58,718
-不  -很有可能
- No... - More than likely.

1581
01:22:58,854 --> 01:23:00,729
毕竟这是很久之前的事了
At any rate, it was a very long time ago.

1582
01:23:00,729 --> 01:23:04,062
而我们可还有更重要的事需要办  弟弟
We do have slightly more pressing matters to hand, little brother.

1583
01:23:04,395 --> 01:23:06,687
莫里亚蒂  死而复生
Moriarty? Back from the dead?

1584
01:23:06,687 --> 01:23:10,187
别忘了我
'Do not forget me.

1585
01:23:11,104 --> 01:23:15,447
别忘了我
'Do not forget me!'

1586
01:23:29,864 --> 01:23:30,770
这是
This?

1587
01:23:31,593 --> 01:23:32,916
我明白了
Oh, I see.

1588
01:23:34,572 --> 01:23:36,427
还是没醒  是吗
Still not awake, am I?

1589
01:24:03,927 --> 01:24:06,281
太深了  夏洛克  太深了
Too deep, Sherlock, way too deep.

1590
01:24:07,364 --> 01:24:09,906
恭喜  你将是史上第一个被活埋在
Congratulations, you will be the first man in history

1591
01:24:09,906 --> 01:24:12,708
自己的思维殿堂里的人
to be buried in his own Mind Palace.

1592
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:17,343
场景布置的有点夸张了  你不觉得吗
The setting is a shade melodramatic, don't you think?

1593
01:24:17,489 --> 01:24:18,572
对你我而言
For you and me?

1594
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:21,166
一点都不夸张
Not at all.

1595
01:24:24,364 --> 01:24:25,614
你到底是什么
What are you?

1596
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,864
你知道我是什么
You know what I am.

1597
01:24:28,552 --> 01:24:29,875
我是莫里亚蒂
I'm Moriarty.

1598
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:32,302
犯罪界的拿破仑
The Napoleon of Crime.

1599
01:24:32,302 --> 01:24:34,791
-莫里亚蒂已经死了  -在你脑中可没有
- Moriarty's dead! - Not in your mind.

1600
01:24:34,791 --> 01:24:36,583
在你脑中我永远都不会死
I'll never be dead there.

1601
01:24:37,187 --> 01:24:39,958
你曾说你的大脑是块硬盘
You once called your brain a hard drive.

1602
01:24:40,104 --> 01:24:42,322
跟病毒打个招呼吧
Well, say hello to the virus.

1603
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,104
这就是我们的结局  你和我
This is how we end, you and I.

1604
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,229
总是在这里
Always here,

1605
01:24:48,135 --> 01:24:49,489
总是你和我一起
always together.

1606
01:24:51,989 --> 01:24:55,093
你的脑子很不错  莫里亚蒂
You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty.

1607
01:24:55,427 --> 01:24:56,791
我很敬佩
I admire it.

1608
01:24:57,406 --> 01:25:00,760
我认为它甚至可能与我相当
I concede it may even be the equal of my own.

1609
01:25:01,177 --> 01:25:02,291
我很感动
I'm touched.

1610
01:25:04,989 --> 01:25:06,093
我很荣幸
I'm honoured.

1611
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:09,145
但说到在悬崖边缘
But when it comes to the matter of unarmed combat

1612
01:25:09,156 --> 01:25:11,156
徒手搏斗
on the edge of a precipice...

1613
01:25:12,718 --> 01:25:14,406
你等着入水吧
You're going in the water,

1614
01:25:15,302 --> 01:25:17,010
小个子
short-arse.

1615
01:25:29,718 --> 01:25:32,593
你觉得自己高大威猛吗  夏洛克
Oh, you think you're so big and strong, Sherlock!

1616
01:25:32,593 --> 01:25:33,802
在我面前可不是
Not with me.

1617
01:25:47,572 --> 01:25:49,500
我是你的弱点
I am your weakness!

1618
01:25:51,697 --> 01:25:53,072
我能打倒你
I keep you down!

1619
01:25:54,822 --> 01:25:58,572
每次你失足  每次你失败
Every time you stumble, every time you fail,

1620
01:25:58,791 --> 01:26:00,447
每当你势弱
when you're weak,

1621
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:02,270
我都
I...am...

1622
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:03,979
在那儿
there!

1623
01:26:06,781 --> 01:26:07,645
不
No,

1624
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:09,677
别抵抗
don't try to fight it.

1625
01:26:09,895 --> 01:26:11,864
躺好  认输吧
Lie back and lose!

1626
01:26:17,697 --> 01:26:19,354
我们一起跳下去吧
Shall we go over together?

1627
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:21,947
必须是我们一起  是吧
It has to be together, doesn't it?

1628
01:26:21,947 --> 01:26:24,812
到最后  永远是你
At the end it's always just you

1629
01:26:25,343 --> 01:26:26,718
和我
and me!

1630
01:26:32,927 --> 01:26:35,354
教授  麻烦你离我朋友远点
Professor, if you wouldn't mind stepping away from my friend,

1631
01:26:35,354 --> 01:26:39,531
我相信  他有点反感你的纠缠
I do believe he finds your attention a shade annoying.

1632
01:26:41,843 --> 01:26:43,666
这不公平  你们二对一
That's not fair, there's two of you!

1633
01:26:44,927 --> 01:26:47,343
我们总是两个人  你不看《斯特兰德月刊》吗
There's always two of us. Don't you read The Strand?

1634
01:26:49,447 --> 01:26:51,062
跪下  教授
On your knees, Professor.

1635
01:26:55,562 --> 01:26:58,468
手背到头后
Hands behind your head.

1636
01:26:59,208 --> 01:27:00,302
谢谢你  约翰
Thank you, John.

1637
01:27:02,604 --> 01:27:04,125
你什么时候开始叫我约翰了
Since when do you call me John?

1638
01:27:05,406 --> 01:27:06,822
你肯定想不到
You'd be surprised.

1639
01:27:07,062 --> 01:27:08,083
未必
No, I wouldn't.

1640
01:27:11,031 --> 01:27:12,583
你该醒来了  夏洛克
Time you woke up, Sherlock.

1641
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,916
我是个讲故事的  我分得出自己是在故事里
I'm a story-teller, I know when I'm in one.

1642
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:18,489
当然
Of course.

1643
01:27:19,302 --> 01:27:20,895
当然了  约翰
Of course you do, John.

1644
01:27:21,812 --> 01:27:22,937
他什么样
So what's he like?

1645
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:26,166
另一个世界的我
The other me in the other place?

1646
01:27:27,187 --> 01:27:28,822
比看上去聪明
Smarter than he looks.

1647
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:30,520
那一定很聪明了
Pretty damn smart, then.

1648
01:27:31,989 --> 01:27:33,395
很聪明
Pretty damn smart.

1649
01:27:33,479 --> 01:27:37,187
你俩直接私奔得了
Ugh, why don't you two just elope, for God's sake?!

1650
01:27:37,562 --> 01:27:38,833
无礼
Impertinent.

1651
01:27:39,656 --> 01:27:40,760
过分
Offensive.

1652
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:43,552
其实  你介意吗
Actually, would you mind?

1653
01:27:43,843 --> 01:27:44,854
完全不
Not at all.

1654
01:27:54,979 --> 01:27:56,875
-本来就该我了  -是啊
- It was my turn. - Quite so.

1655
01:27:57,645 --> 01:27:59,729
你打算怎么醒过来
So how do you plan to wake up?

1656
01:28:03,187 --> 01:28:04,552
就这样吧
I should think like this.

1657
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,447
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1658
01:28:08,437 --> 01:28:11,239
偷偷告诉你  约翰  坠落是杀不死我的
Between you and me, John, I always survive a fall.

1659
01:28:11,781 --> 01:28:12,635
可你是怎么做到
But how?

1660
01:28:14,614 --> 01:28:16,479
很简单的  亲爱的华生
Elementary, my dear Watson.

1661
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:51,895
-想我了吗  -夏洛克  你没事吧
- Miss me? - Sherlock, are you all right?

1662
01:28:51,895 --> 01:28:53,677
是的  当然  我怎么会有事呢
Yes. Of course I am, why wouldn't I be?

1663
01:28:53,677 --> 01:28:56,020
因为你可能刚服药过量  你该入院
Because you probably just OD'd. You should be in hospital.

1664
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:57,239
没时间了
Hm, no time.

1665
01:28:57,968 --> 01:29:00,687
我得赶紧去贝克街  莫里亚蒂回来了
I have to go to Baker Street now, Moriarty's back.

1666
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:03,041
我都希望他是真回来了
I almost hope he is,

1667
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:05,364
如果能让你不再沉迷于此
if it'll save you from this.

1668
01:29:07,677 --> 01:29:09,010
现在用不着这个了
No need for that now,

1669
01:29:09,718 --> 01:29:10,760
我有真正好玩的了
I've got the real thing.

1670
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,979
-我有工作了  -夏洛克
- I have work to do. - Sherlock...

1671
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,520
保证我
..Promise me.

1672
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:19,041
你还站这儿干什么
What are you still doing here?

1673
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:21,020
你不是该去帮我搞个赦免还是什么的吗
Shouldn't you be off getting me a pardon or something,

1674
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:22,604
像个好大哥那样
like a proper big brother?

1675
01:29:28,322 --> 01:29:29,406
华生医生
Dr Watson...

1676
01:29:34,052 --> 01:29:35,187
照顾好他
Look after him.

1677
01:29:37,072 --> 01:29:37,916
拜托
Please.

1678
01:29:59,812 --> 01:30:01,395
夏洛克  等等  解释一下
Sherlock, hang on, explain.

1679
01:30:01,666 --> 01:30:02,937
莫里亚蒂还活着吗
Moriarty's alive, then?

1680
01:30:02,937 --> 01:30:05,260
我没说他活着  我说他回来了
I never said he was alive, I said he was back.

1681
01:30:05,354 --> 01:30:06,531
那么他死了吗
So he's dead?

1682
01:30:06,697 --> 01:30:07,385
他当然死了
Of course he's dead,

1683
01:30:07,385 --> 01:30:09,604
他开枪爆了自己的头  不可能活下来
he blew his own brains out, no-one survives that.

1684
01:30:10,156 --> 01:30:12,635
我刚刚为了证明这点而服药过量
I just went to the trouble of an overdose to prove it.

1685
01:30:13,781 --> 01:30:16,697
莫里亚蒂死了  毫无疑问
Moriarty is dead, no question.

1686
01:30:17,843 --> 01:30:22,010
但更重要的是  我很清楚他接下来要做什么
But more importantly, I know exactly what he's going to do next.

1687
01:30:32,635 --> 01:30:33,875
飞行机
Flying machines,

1688
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:36,239
还有什么...电话
these, er, telephone contraptions?

1689
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:38,291
这是什么疯狂的幻想啊
What sort of lunatic fantasy is that?

1690
01:30:38,291 --> 01:30:39,406
只是我对
It was simply my conjecture

1691
01:30:39,406 --> 01:30:40,958
未来世界
of what a future world might look like

1692
01:30:40,968 --> 01:30:43,489
和你我在其中角色的猜想
and how you and I might fit inside it.

1693
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:45,989
一个逻辑学家应该可以从一滴水
From a drop of water a logician should be able to infer

1694
01:30:45,989 --> 01:30:48,593
推断出是大西洋还是尼亚加拉河
the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara.

1695
01:30:48,593 --> 01:30:50,031
或是莱辛巴赫瀑布
Or a Reichenbach?

1696
01:30:50,343 --> 01:30:53,000
-你把这桩案子写好了吗  -是的
- Have you written up your account of the case? - Yes.

1697
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:55,541
经过修改把它写成了
Modified to put it down as

1698
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:58,333
-罕见的我未能破案的案例了吧  -当然
- one of my rare failures, of course? - Of course.

1699
01:31:01,635 --> 01:31:03,093
《无形军队
The Adventure Of...

1700
01:31:03,593 --> 01:31:05,156
历险记》
The Invisible Army.

1701
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:08,343
或者愤怒军团
The League Of Furies?

1702
01:31:09,406 --> 01:31:10,958
恐怖军团
The Monstrous Regiment?

1703
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:14,864
我倒想起名为《恐怖新娘》
I rather thought The Abominable Bride.

1704
01:31:15,697 --> 01:31:17,208
-有点庸俗  -但会畅销的
- A trifle lurid. - It'll sell.

1705
01:31:17,208 --> 01:31:18,854
而且还包含了正式八经的谋杀
It's got proper murders in it too.

1706
01:31:18,854 --> 01:31:20,072
你是这方面的专家嘛
You're the expert.

1707
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:22,322
至于你的故事
As for your own tale,

1708
01:31:23,593 --> 01:31:27,270
你还确定你只用了7%的溶剂吗
are you sure it's still just a 7% solution that you take?

1709
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:29,562
我觉得你是不是调高用量了
I think you may have increased the dosage.

1710
01:31:29,572 --> 01:31:31,552
或许我是有点异想天开了
Perhaps I was being a little fanciful.

1711
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:35,541
但或许  这种事真的会发生
But perhaps such things could come to pass.

1712
01:31:36,906 --> 01:31:39,531
不管怎样  我相信我在那个世界会很自在的
In any case, I know I would be very much at home in such a world.

1713
01:31:39,531 --> 01:31:42,458
-我看我不会的  -我不敢苟同
- Huh, I don't think I would be. - I beg to differ.

1714
01:31:44,218 --> 01:31:46,843
但我一向知道自己是个先于时代之人
But then I've always known I was a man out of his time.
