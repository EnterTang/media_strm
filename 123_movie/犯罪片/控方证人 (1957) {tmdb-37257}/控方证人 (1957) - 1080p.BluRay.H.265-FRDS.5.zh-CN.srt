1
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:17,099
Silence. Be upstanding in court.

2
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:20,776
All persons who have anything
to do before my lords,

3
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:25,922
the queen's justices of oyer and
terminer and general jail delivery

4
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:29,464
for the jurisdiction of the
Central Criminal Court

5
00:00:29,716 --> 00:00:34,165
draw near and give your attendance.
God save the queen.

6
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:07,569
What a beautiful day. I've been hoping
for a bit of sun for our homecoming.

7
00:02:07,856 --> 00:02:10,785
It's worth having the
fog just to appreciate

8
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,738
the sunshine. Is
there a draught?

9
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:18,879
- Shall I roll up the window?
- Roll up your mouth. You talk too much.

10
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:22,603
If I'd known how much you talked
I'd never have come out of my coma.

11
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:25,078
- This thing weighs a ton.
- Now, now.

12
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,740
We've been flat on our back for two
months, we'd better be careful.

13
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:46,059
Lovely, lovely. It must be perfectly lovely
to live and work in the Inns of Court.

14
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:48,841
How lucky you lawyers are.

15
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:53,505
I almost married a lawyer. I was
in attendance for his appendectomy

16
00:02:53,777 --> 00:02:56,383
and we became engaged as
soon as he could sit up.

17
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:59,537
And then peritonitis set
in and he went like that.

18
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:02,753
He certainly was a lucky lawyer.

19
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:18,477
Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember
we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.

20
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,808
Oh, shut up!

21
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:22,981
Williams, my cane.

22
00:03:29,313 --> 00:03:31,281
Here he comes!

23
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:46,467
Good afternoon. Thank you very
much. Everybody back to work.

24
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:50,752
Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like
to read you a poem to welcome you back.

25
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:55,048
Very touching. You can recite it
after office hours in your own time.

26
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:57,706
Now back to work.
What's the matter with you?

27
00:03:57,925 --> 00:04:00,974
Nothing. I'm just happy that
you're your old self again.

28
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:05,269
Any more sentimentality around here,
I shall go back to the hospital!

29
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:09,004
They won't take him back. He wasn't
really discharged, you know,

30
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,512
he was expelled for conduct
unbecoming a cardiac patient.

31
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:17,222
Put these in water, blabbermouth!
Come on in, Carter.

32
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:27,107
Look at this room.
It's ugly, old and musty.

33
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:31,178
But I never knew I could
miss anything so much.

34
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,621
- Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

35
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:37,051
I'm not a religious
man, but when they

36
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:39,247
carted you off, I went
out and lit a candle.

37
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:41,358
Why, thank you, Carter.

38
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:43,190
Actually, sir, I was
lighting it for myself.

39
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,156
If anything happened to you, what
would happen to me, after 37 years?

40
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:50,402
37 years!
Has it been all that long?

41
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:55,445
Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October
1915. The Shepherd's Bush murder.

42
00:04:55,774 --> 00:05:00,496
The chemist accused of putting
cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.

43
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:05,622
My first murder trial. I was more
frightened than the defendant.

44
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:10,593
First time I rose to make an objection,
my wig fell off. Where's my wig?

45
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:12,882
Right here.

46
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:17,892
- I've guarded it with me life.
- I hope it still fits.

47
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:20,936
I lost 30lbs in that
wretched hospital.

48
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:24,735
Still, I suppose my
head isn't any smaller.

49
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,935
What's all this?

50
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:36,547
- We've put it in mothballs.
- Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?

51
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:40,179
Of course. The solicitors have
been breaking down our doors.

52
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:44,051
- I've got some interesting briefs for you.
- That's better.

53
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:48,772
Divorce case, a tax appeal, and an
important marine insurance claim.

54
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:52,286
- Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.
- No, Carter.

55
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:56,703
I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake
any criminal cases. Your doctors have...

56
00:05:57,002 --> 00:06:01,371
Doctors! They've deprived me of
alcohol, tobacco, female companionship.

57
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:04,199
If only they'd let me do
something worthwhile!

58
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:05,427
Sorry, sir.

59
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:09,121
Might as well get a bigger box,
more mothballs, put me away too.

60
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:11,198
2:30, Sir Wilfrid.
Time for our little nap!

61
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:13,030
Oh, get out!

62
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,440
Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs
now, get undressed and lie down.

63
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:21,338
- We? What a nauseating prospect.
- Upstairs, please.

64
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,056
Are you aware that,
while on my sickbed,

65
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:29,490
I seriously considered strangling you
with one of your own rubber tubes.

66
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:35,549
I would then have admitted the crime,
retained myself for the defence.

67
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:41,844
My lord, members of the jury, I hereby
enter a plea of justifiable homicide.

68
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:47,061
For four months this alleged angel
of mercy has pored, probed,

69
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:51,357
punctured, pillaged and
plundered my helpless body

70
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,611
while tormenting my mind with
a steady drip of baby talk.

71
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:58,465
Come along now,
like a good boy. Oh, no.

72
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:01,374
Take your hands off me,
or I'll strike you with my cane.

73
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:04,896
- You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.
- What cigars?

74
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:08,441
- The ones you're smuggling in your cane.
- Cane?

75
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:18,664
You could be jailed for this.
You had no search warrant.

76
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:22,080
In hospital he'd hide cigars
and brandy all over the place.

77
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:25,022
We called him Wilfrid the fox.

78
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:29,307
- I'm confiscating these.
- Can't I have just one?

79
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:31,882
No. Upstairs.

80
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:35,863
A few puffs after meals? Please.

81
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:41,236
I'll do it. Some dark night when her back
is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer

82
00:07:41,523 --> 00:07:45,289
and plunge it between her shoulder
blades. So help me, I will.

83
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,658
Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up.
We've

84
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:51,770
installed something for you here.
It's a lift.

85
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,880
A lift? I'm sick of this plot
to make me a helpless invalid.

86
00:07:56,163 --> 00:08:00,088
I think it's a splendid idea.
Let's try it, shall we?

87
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:04,983
Out of there. I'll try it. It's my
lift because it was my heart attack.

88
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:08,983
Here you are. Simply press this
button for up and this one for down.

89
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,229
Carter, I warn you, if this
contraption should collapse,

90
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:16,601
if the barrister should
fall off the bannister...

91
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:26,762
Remarkable. Smoothest
flight I've had in years.

92
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:29,334
Upsy-daisy!

93
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:31,707
Once more to get the
feel of the controls.

94
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:48,492
Good afternoon. Is it
possible to see Sir Wilfrid?

95
00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:51,400
I didn't make an appointment,
but this is urgent.

96
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:53,904
If it's about a brief,
I'm sorry, but we're

97
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:56,197
full. Sir Wilfrid has
all that he can handle.

98
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,597
I'm sure he'll want this brief.

99
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:01,289
Serious criminal matter.

100
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:06,731
Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.
Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.

101
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:09,954
He can't accept anything of
an overstimulating nature.

102
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:13,278
Put me on a diet of bland
civil suits. Hello, Mayhew.

103
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:16,012
Hello. Distressing news
about your health.

104
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:19,770
It's tragic. You'd better get
a man with younger arteries.

105
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:23,759
If you could just give us a few minutes.
This is Mr Leonard Vole.

106
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:26,653
He's in rather a ghastly
mess, I'm afraid.

107
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,287
How do you do, Mr Vole?

108
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:32,601
Well, according to Mr Mayhew,
I'm not doing at all well.

109
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:35,449
Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!

110
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,762
- You're dawdling again!
- Oh, shut up!

111
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:43,021
Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when
you've something not too stimulating.

112
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:46,282
Like a postman bitten
by a stray dog.

113
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:57,407
I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but I
quite understand. Take care of yourself.

114
00:09:58,702 --> 00:10:01,785
Mayhew! Mayhew!

115
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:04,690
Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.

116
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:08,319
Don't worry, we won't take the
brief, but an old friend needs help.

117
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:11,318
Surely I can give him
a word of advice.

118
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:15,348
Come on, I'll give you five minutes.
No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.

119
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:18,242
Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!

120
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:21,078
You go ahead. Start it without me.

121
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:25,036
This is your fault. You
should not have permitted it.

122
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,877
It is not my fault. I distinctly
told Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.

123
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:31,516
Well, if it's anyone's fault,
I expect it's mine.

124
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:34,818
Seems silly to me, but Mr
Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.

125
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:38,872
- He thinks I may be arrested any minute.
- Arrested for what?

126
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,207
Well, for murder.

127
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:42,901
Oh!

128
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,687
It's the case of Emily French. You've
probably seen reports in the press.

129
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,645
Middle-aged widow, well-off, living
with a housekeeper at Hampstead.

130
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:52,969
Mr Vole had been with her earlier.

131
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:55,983
When the housekeeper returned,
she found her dead,

132
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:58,425
struck on the back of
the head and killed.

133
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:01,686
Vole seems caught in a web
of circumstantial evidence.

134
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:05,653
Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd
suggest the strongest line of defence.

135
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:09,383
- I'd probably think better with a cigar.
- Of course.

136
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:13,573
No previous convictions. He's of good
character with an excellent war record.

137
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,990
- You'd like him a lot.
- They've confiscated the matches. A light.

138
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:22,332
The defence may tum on establishing
an alibi for the night of the murder.

139
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:27,181
- I haven't got any. Let me get you some.
- Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.

140
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:30,070
This will take all our cunning.

141
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:36,854
Young man!

142
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,859
Come here, please.

143
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:43,182
Your solicitor and I feel you may be able
to enlighten me on an important point.

144
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:45,521
- Yes. Thank you.
- Sir Wilfrid!

145
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:48,696
You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!

146
00:11:52,107 --> 00:11:54,474
- Give me a match.
- Sorry, I never carry them.

147
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:57,537
- What? You said I'd like him.
- But I do have a lighter.

148
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:01,067
You're quite right, Mayhew,
I do like him. Thank you.

149
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:05,649
Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's
face if she saw me now?

150
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:10,118
Then let's make absolutely
sure that she doesn't.

151
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:14,308
Splendid. All the instincts
of a skilled criminal.

152
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:17,353
- Thank you, sir.
- Here.

153
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:24,330
Whether or not you murdered
a middle-aged widow,

154
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:28,197
you certainly saved the life
of an elderly barrister.

155
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:30,639
I haven't murdered anybody.
It's absurd.

156
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:34,825
Christine, that's my wife, she thought
I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.

157
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:38,237
That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.
Now he thinks he needs a lawyer

158
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:40,967
and now I have two lawyers.
It's rather silly.

159
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:43,360
I am a solicitor.
Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.

160
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:46,579
Only a barrister can actually
plead a case in court.

161
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:50,753
- Oh, I see.
- She shall not even find the ashes.

162
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,729
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

163
00:12:56,964 --> 00:13:00,810
I saw in the paper that Mrs French had
been found dead with her head bashed in.

164
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:05,815
It also said the police were anxious to
interview me since I visited that evening.

165
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:09,905
- Naturally, I went to the police station.
- Did they caution you?

166
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:13,667
I don't quite know. They asked
if I'd like to make a statement

167
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:18,183
and said they'd write it down and it might
be used against me. Is that a caution?

168
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:20,567
Well, it can't be helped now.

169
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:25,023
- They seemed quite satisfied.
- They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.

170
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:29,011
He thinks that he made a statement and
that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious

171
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:33,976
that you will be regarded as the principal
suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.

172
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,534
I've done nothing!
Why should I be arrested?

173
00:13:36,753 --> 00:13:40,838
This is England! You don't get arrested
or convicted for crimes you haven't done.

174
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:43,659
We try not to make a habit of it.

175
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:47,360
But it does happen,
though, doesn't it?

176
00:13:47,598 --> 00:13:52,047
Of course. There was that case of that
fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.

177
00:13:52,352 --> 00:13:55,515
In jail for years and they suddenly
found it was another chap.

178
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:59,254
- He'd been innocent!
- Unfortunate, but restitution was made.

179
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:03,656
He received a pardon, a bounty from the
crown, and was restored to normal life.

180
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:07,588
That's all right for him. What if it
had been murder? What if he'd hanged?

181
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:10,951
How would they have restored
him to his normal life then?

182
00:14:11,204 --> 00:14:15,414
Mr Vole, you must not take
such a morbid point of view.

183
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:19,600
It's just when you say these things are
closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.

184
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,408
Relax. You're in the hands of the finest,
most experienced barrister in London.

185
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:28,165
Let's get this straight. I may have
done something highly unethical.

186
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,912
I've taken your cigar but I'm
not taking your case. I can't.

187
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:37,111
I'm forbidden. My doctors would never
allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.

188
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:40,249
But if you'd like the case
handled by these chambers,

189
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:44,170
- I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.
- Yes. A very able man.

190
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:49,816
- I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.
- All right, sir, if you say so.

191
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:55,215
Hold this.

192
00:14:58,585 --> 00:14:59,746
Carter?

193
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,686
I would like to see Brogan-Moore here
as soon as he comes in from court.

194
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:06,776
Sir Wilfrid, I have never
known such insubordination.

195
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,251
Not even as a nurse during the war.

196
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:13,112
What war was that?
The Crimean War, no doubt.

197
00:15:14,268 --> 00:15:17,590
You'll like Brogan-Moore, he's had
excellent training. Under me.

198
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:21,654
This morning I had no lawyers at
all and now suddenly I have three.

199
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:24,593
We should explain that I
have very little money.

200
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,061
I shan't be able to pay
all the costs and fees.

201
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:29,488
We'll get a fourth
lawyer to sue you.

202
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,704
He won't get very much.
I haven't had a job in four months.

203
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:35,877
- What sort of work do you do?
- Well, uh...

204
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:41,368
My last job was as a mechanic. The
foreman kept riding me all the time.

205
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:43,305
I took it as long as
I could, then I quit.

206
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,921
And before that?

207
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:49,303
I worked in a department store, in toys,
demonstrating children's building sets.

208
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:54,317
Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.
Before that I tested electric blankets.

209
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:56,910
Electric blankets?

210
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,203
I suppose you think
I'm a bit of a drifter.

211
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:02,001
It's true, in a way,
but I'm really not like that.

212
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:06,601
My army service unsettled me. That and
living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.

213
00:16:06,904 --> 00:16:09,510
It was fine there, though.
That's where I met my wife.

214
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,189
She was an actress, and a good one.
She's a wonderful wife to me, too.

215
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:17,100
But I haven't been much of
a provider, I'm afraid.

216
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:21,734
Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle
down now I've come back to this country.

217
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:25,969
- If I could just put my eggbeater across.
- Eggbeater?

218
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:31,721
Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.
Nothing big, just little household things.

219
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:35,103
Pocket pencil sharpeners,
key chain flashlights.

220
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:37,556
But my best is really
this eggbeater.

221
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:41,090
It not only beats, it also
separates the yolk from the white.

222
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:43,676
Is that really desirable?

223
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:46,345
If you were a housewife,
you'd see it right away.

224
00:16:46,568 --> 00:16:49,697
The trouble is, I need money for
manufacturing and promotion.

225
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:53,838
I was really hoping that's what Mrs
French might do for me after I met her.

226
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:59,283
- Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?
- That's rather funny in itself.

227
00:16:59,623 --> 00:17:03,264
It was 3 September. I remember
because it's my wife's birthday.

228
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:06,274
I was window-shopping
in Oxford Street,

229
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:11,272
daydreaming about what I'd buy
for her, if I had any money.

230
00:17:58,473 --> 00:18:00,475
- You really like this one?
- Very much.

231
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:03,130
- You don't think it's too mad?
- Mad?

232
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:07,642
Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't
recommend it to every woman. But you?

233
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:10,706
- Why shouldn't you attract attention?
- You think so?

234
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:14,232
Absolutely. But if I could
suggest one little thing.

235
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:18,653
Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back
a bit like that. Show more of your face.

- Good...

00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,612
You buy that hat. I insist.

239
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:32,190
Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat-
a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.

240
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:36,796
I'm constantly surprised that women's
hats do not provoke more murders.

Go on, please.

I was only trying to be nice
to make her feel good.

243
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:43,473
I never dreamed I'd see
her again. Or the hat.

244
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:45,847
- But you did?
- Yes, a few weeks later.

245
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:51,513
Again, by accident. I was peddling my
eggbeaters and business was a little slow.

You chose it yourself.

- May I?
- Sure, if you like.

251
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:35,007
Thank you. It's such a bother taking
it off and putting it back on again.

252

That chap is Jesse James. They've led him
into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.

- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.
- He does?

254
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,805
- I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.
- You do?

255
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:51,170
I get restless so I go out. Then I find
I've no place to go so I go to the movies.

256
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:55,553
Sometimes I see the same one
two or three times. Ooh.

At this time you had no idea
that Mrs French was well-off?

259
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:04,771
No. Absolutely not. We were
sitting in the cheap seats.

260
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:08,703
All I knew was she seemed to be very
lonely, had no friends whatsoever.

261
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:11,664
She and her husband lived
abroad in British Nigeria.

262

He was in the colonial service.
He died in '45, of a heart attack.

Please, Mayhew, not when
I'm smoking. Go on, young man.

Well, they finally
polished off Jesse James,

I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.

But this beats so quickly
and it separates too!

It must be cen-trifugal or
centrifugal, which is it?

Did you hear that, Janet?
It whips cream too.

We must have one. Is it expensive?

Compliments of the inventor,

Well, now, there's a loveable chap.

He wore it when he pulled
our servants' teeth.

286

So Hubert used to call
him a witch dentist.

00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:56,435
- Let's use our good silver and china.
- Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.

290
00:21:56,753 --> 00:21:59,643
- This is perfectly all right.
- Lemon or milk, please?

291
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:02,248
- I don't really care.
- Would you prefer sherry?

292
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:04,435
- That'd be fine.
- We've no' got any.

293
00:22:04,636 --> 00:22:08,800
Oh, but we have. There's that bottle,
the one we bought last Christmas.

294
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:13,900
If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted
egg in the kitchen ready and separated.

295
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:18,917
Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.
It's just that she's terribly Scotch.

296
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:22,636
Oh, is she? I thought she
came with the collection.

297
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:27,664
You know, maybe I'll take
a glass of sherry myself.

298
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:30,636
I feel like Christmas, somehow.

299
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:36,438
After that I saw her once or twice a week.
She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.

300
00:22:36,752 --> 00:22:39,676
We'd talk, play canasta,
listen to gramophone records,

301
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:42,050
Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.

302
00:22:42,257 --> 00:22:46,421
It's so weird to think of her now,
lying in that living room, murdered.

303
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,089
I assure you she's been moved by now.
To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful,

304
00:22:51,391 --> 00:22:53,359
and unsanitary.

305
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:58,627
Tell Sir Wilfrid about the
evening of the murder.

306
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:02,009
I went around to see her
about eight o'clock.

307
00:23:02,236 --> 00:23:05,080
She fixed a sandwich,
we talked, listened to The Mikado.

308
00:23:05,322 --> 00:23:09,247
I left about nine. I walked home.
I got there about half past.

309
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:13,505
I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or
out of court, in the witness box, anywhere!

310
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:16,360
How much money did you
get from Mrs French?

311
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,585
- Nothing.
- The truth. How much?

312
00:23:18,794 --> 00:23:22,401
- Why should she give me any money?
- Because she was in love with you.

313
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:24,641
That's ridiculous. She liked me.

314
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:27,765
She pampered me like an aunt.
But that's all, I swear.

315
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:30,662
- Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?
- I did!

316
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:34,098
But you never took your wife along
when you went there. Why not?

317
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:36,115
- Because...
- Because what?

318
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:39,758
Because she was under the impression
we didn't get along too well.

319
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:42,344
- Is that true?
- No! We love each other.

320
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:46,368
- Then how did she get that impression?
- She just seemed to want to believe it.

321
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:49,943
- You never corrected her. Why?
- I was afraid she'd lose interest.

322
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,443
Because she was rich, and
you were after her money.

323
00:23:53,704 --> 00:23:55,706
Well, yes, in a way.

324
00:23:56,415 --> 00:24:01,057
I was hoping for a loan for my new
invention. Just a few hundred pounds.

325
00:24:01,378 --> 00:24:04,541
An honest business proposition,
that's all. Is that so wicked?

326
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:06,880
You knew it was the
housekeeper's day off?

327
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:09,698
- Well, yes.
- You went there because she'd be alone?

328
00:24:09,928 --> 00:24:12,374
No, because I thought
she might be lonely.

329
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:16,239
All right, lonely. You and the rich
lonely widow all alone in that house

330
00:24:16,518 --> 00:24:19,283
with a gramophone
blaring The Mikado.

331
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:22,092
Perhaps you turned up the
volume to drown her cries.

332
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:26,765
- When I left her she was alive!
- When Janet came back she was dead.

333
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,870
The house had been ransacked! It said
in the papers. It must've been a burglar.

334
00:24:31,158 --> 00:24:34,367
I didn't do it. No matter how bad
things look, I didn't do it!

335
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,784
You must believe me.
You do believe me, don't you?

336
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:42,006
I do now, but I wasn't sure.

337
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,578
That's why I subjected your eyes
and my arteries to that ordeal.

338
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,046
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

339
00:24:48,258 --> 00:24:52,024
As for things looking bad, they don't
look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.

340
00:24:52,304 --> 00:24:56,468
- Apparently you've no alibi at all.
- But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.

341
00:24:56,767 --> 00:24:59,976
- By bus or underground?
- No, I walked. It was a fine night.

342
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:03,153
- Did anyone see you?
- Christine saw me when I got home.

343
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:08,359
It was 9.26. I know because I went right to
work on a clock I've been tinkering with.

344
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:11,346
- My wife will tell you.
- Your wife loves you, yes?

345
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:13,814
Very much. We're
devoted to each other.

346
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:19,074
You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a
devoted wife does not carry much weight.

347
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:22,065
People might think Christine
would lie on my account?

348
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:26,092
It has been known, Mr Vole.
Blood is thicker than evidence.

349
00:25:27,464 --> 00:25:32,072
- Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.
- So good to have you out of hospital.

350
00:25:32,386 --> 00:25:37,074
I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on
parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.

351
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:40,076
- This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.
- How do you do?

352
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,597
- How do you do?
- The Emily French murder.

353
00:25:42,813 --> 00:25:45,100
- Oh, how do you do?
- Badly, thank you.

354
00:25:45,315 --> 00:25:49,206
A mass of circumstantial evidence.
No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.

355
00:25:49,486 --> 00:25:51,727
- Tossing it into your lap.
- Much obliged.

356
00:25:51,947 --> 00:25:54,951
Your line of defence,
however, will be lack of motive.

357
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,204
You will agree that we can rule
out a crime of passion, hm?

358
00:25:58,453 --> 00:26:01,138
That leaves us with a
murder for profit.

359
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:05,344
If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs
French, why cut off the source of supply?

360
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:10,076
Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg,
why kill the goose before it was laid?

361
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:13,306
No motive. No motive whatsoever.

362
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,359
You find some flaw
in this reasoning?

363
00:26:17,372 --> 00:26:19,771
No, no, it's very sound
as far as it goes.

364
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,310
Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole
very responsive and quite candid.

365
00:26:24,605 --> 00:26:27,848
So candid, he's already told me
we'll have to sue him for our fees.

366
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:31,794
Oh, we'll simply put a
lean on Mr Vole's £80,000.

367
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,314
- What £80,000?
- The £80,000 Mrs French left you.

368
00:26:36,617 --> 00:26:37,743
Left me?

369
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,871
They opened Mrs French's bank
vault today and found her will.

370
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:48,080
- Congratulations.
- £80,000!

371
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:51,825
And I was worried about a couple of
hundred for that silly eggbeater.

372
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,058
I must call Christine.

373
00:26:58,222 --> 00:26:59,667
Oh.

374
00:26:59,848 --> 00:27:02,738
This doesn't make things look
any better for me, does it?

375
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:06,298
- No. I wouldn't think so.
- So now they'll say I did have a motive.

376
00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:11,888
They will indeed. £80,000 makes
for a very handsome motive.

377
00:27:12,236 --> 00:27:14,807
I thought you were crazy but
now they will arrest me!

378
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,998
It's not unlikely.

379
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:20,476
<font color="#808080">(CAR PULLS UP)</font>

380
00:27:24,414 --> 00:27:27,702
As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.
They're on their way up now.

381
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,329
I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea
she'd any intention of leaving me money.

382
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:36,875
- If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?
- We'll certainly bring that out in court.

383
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:41,546
- It's our old friend Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector as of last month.

384
00:27:41,848 --> 00:27:45,375
Chief Inspector? They must think
a lot of you at Scotland Yard.

385
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:48,215
You're getting the
deluxe treatment.

386
00:27:48,438 --> 00:27:53,604
- Oh, in here, Chief Inspector.
- Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.

387
00:27:53,944 --> 00:27:57,551
That's perfectly all right. I never
object to the actions of the police

388
00:27:57,823 --> 00:28:01,509
- except once in a great while in court.
- Yes, sir, I still have the scars.

389
00:28:01,785 --> 00:28:04,152
You know Mr Mayhew,
Mr Brogan-Moore.

390
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:08,774
This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search
him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.

391
00:28:09,084 --> 00:28:11,655
- Is your name Leonard Vole?
- Yes, it is.

392
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:17,362
I have a warrant for your arrest on
the charge of murdering Emily French.

393
00:28:17,718 --> 00:28:22,519
I must warn you that anything you say
may be taken down and used in evidence.

394
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:25,692
Well, I'm ready.
Must I be handcuffed?

395
00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:28,335
That won't be necessary, sir.

396
00:28:28,562 --> 00:28:31,964
I've never been arrested before,
not even for walking a dog off a lead

397
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:35,918
- or having a beer after hours.
- There's no disgrace in being arrested.

398
00:28:36,194 --> 00:28:41,360
Kings, prime ministers, archbishops,
even barristers have stood in the dock.

399
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:49,884
- Somebody better call my wife.
- I will, don't worry.

400
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:52,295
I'll go too, see you're
properly charged.

401
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:53,895
You will see to it
that he is well-treated?

402
00:28:53,908 --> 00:28:55,312
We will.

403
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:59,188
Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.

404
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:02,799
That's very kind
of you, Sir Wilfrid.

405
00:29:02,812 --> 00:29:05,194
I'd better not. It would
constitute a bribe.

406
00:29:07,017 --> 00:29:08,985
We ought to be going, Mr Vole.

407
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:17,203
One thing I've learned for sure, never
look in a window with women's hats.

408
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:19,454
Good day, sir.

409
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,697
Makes a very nice
impression, doesn't he?

410
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:28,039
- Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?
- Passed with flying colours.

411
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,732
I hope he does as well in the dock.
This is sticky, you know.

412
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,686
Of course. The prosecution will blast
in with their heaviest artillery.

413
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:40,332
All you'll have is one little popgun,
an alibi furnished by his wife.

414
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:42,636
Isn't that an intriguing challenge?

415
00:29:42,844 --> 00:29:46,690
I think I'd like it more if it was less
of a challenge and less intriguing.

416
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:52,685
Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.
In bed in one minute or she'll resign.

417
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:56,264
Splendid. Give her a month's pay
and kick her down the stairs.

418
00:29:56,525 --> 00:29:59,529
Either you take care of yourself
or I, too, shall resign.

419
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:02,258
This is blackmail.
But you're quite right.

420
00:30:02,489 --> 00:30:06,460
For my first day this has already been
rather hectic. I should be in bed.

421
00:30:10,664 --> 00:30:14,430
I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole
and have her come over. Will you sit in?

422
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:20,672
Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope
with emotional wives drenched in tears.

423
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:26,965
Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look,
waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.

424
00:30:27,306 --> 00:30:29,468
Take me, I'm yours.

425
00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:32,411
Oh!

426
00:30:32,436 --> 00:30:36,839
About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently,
especially when you tell her of the arrest.

427
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:41,711
Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare
for hysterics, even a fainting spell.

428
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:46,034
Better have smelling salts ready,
box of tissues and a nip of brandy.

429
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:49,727
<font color="#804040">WOMAN</font>: I do not think
that will be necessary.

430
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:55,395
I never faint in case
I don't fall gracefully,

431
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:59,312
and I never use smelling salts
because they puff up the eyes.

432
00:30:59,588 --> 00:31:01,989
I'm Christine Vole.

433
00:31:02,215 --> 00:31:04,741
How do you do?
This is Mr Brogan-Moore.

434
00:31:04,968 --> 00:31:06,936
How do you do?

435
00:31:07,137 --> 00:31:10,061
- I am Wilfrid Robarts.
- How do you do?

436
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:13,117
My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid
we have bad news for you.

437
00:31:13,352 --> 00:31:18,153
- Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.
- There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.

438
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:21,929
Leonard has been arrested and
charged with murder. Is that it?

439
00:31:22,194 --> 00:31:25,516
- Yes.
- I knew he would be, I told him so.

440
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:28,307
I'm glad you're showing
such fortitude.

441
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:31,503
Call it what you like.
What is the next step?

442
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:34,730
Your husband will have to
stand trial, I'm afraid.

443
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:39,963
Will you explain the procedure?
Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.

444
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:41,626
Oh?

445
00:31:41,797 --> 00:31:44,528
- You will not defend Leonard?
- Regrettably not.

446
00:31:44,758 --> 00:31:47,238
My health, or, rather,
the lack of it, forbids me.

447
00:31:47,469 --> 00:31:52,714
It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described
you as champion of the hopeless 'cause.

448
00:31:56,103 --> 00:31:59,903
Is it, perhaps, that this
'cause is too hopeless?

449
00:32:07,114 --> 00:32:11,915
I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison.
It was a mistake to let you come back here.

450
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:14,770
I should have taken you to
a rest-home or a resort.

451
00:32:14,997 --> 00:32:17,364
Some place quiet,
far off, like Bermuda.

452
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:20,427
Shut up. You just want to see
me in those nasty shorts.

453
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:23,832
Come now, Sir Wilfrid,
you must not think of it.

454
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:27,935
You must get ready for sleep,
think beautiful thoughts.

455
00:32:28,969 --> 00:32:34,214
Now, let's get undressed. Put these on,
tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.

456
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,482
After your rest we'll
have a nice cup of cocoa.

457
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:40,698
Then perhaps we'll have a
walk around the square.

458
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:43,510
You know, I feel sorry
for that nice Mr Vole.

459
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:48,103
And not just because he was arrested,
but that wife of his. She must be German.

460
00:32:48,405 --> 00:32:52,888
That's what happens when we let our
boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.

461
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:57,604
The government should do something
about foreign wives. Like an embargo.

462
00:32:57,915 --> 00:33:01,681
How else can we take care of our own
surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?

463
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,281
All right. Hop in!

464
00:33:05,464 --> 00:33:07,785
Sir Wilfrid?

465
00:33:10,677 --> 00:33:12,361
Sir Wilfrid!

466
00:33:12,554 --> 00:33:14,283
Come back!

467
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:19,285
Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had
been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.

468
00:33:19,603 --> 00:33:20,729
Go on.

469
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,503
I knew when he came home with a pair
of green socks she'd knitted for him.

470
00:33:24,775 --> 00:33:27,858
That's quite natural. I'm sure
a jury will find it endearing.

471
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:31,957
Leonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of green

472
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:34,323
and the socks were
two sizes too large,

473
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:37,140
but he wore them just the
same to give her pleasure.

474
00:33:37,371 --> 00:33:39,339
Leonard has a way with women.

475
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:45,103
I only hope he has an all-woman jury.
They will carry him from court in triumph.

476
00:33:45,462 --> 00:33:50,309
A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know
Mrs French left your husband money?

477
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:52,636
Yes. A lot of money.

478
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:57,532
Of course, your husband had no
previous knowledge of this bequest?

479
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:00,011
Is that what he told you?

480
00:34:00,227 --> 00:34:02,628
Surely you're not
suggesting different?

481
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:06,745
Oh, no, no. I do not
suggest anything.

482
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:12,668
Clearly, she had come to look upon your
husband as a son or favourite nephew.

483
00:34:13,532 --> 00:34:17,218
You think Mrs French looked upon
Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?

484
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:21,021
I do. An entirely natural and
understandable relationship.

485
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,533
What hypocrites you
are in this country.

486
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:28,748
Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.

487
00:34:28,964 --> 00:34:33,413
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.

488
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:37,610
You realise your husband's entire
defence rests on his word and yours?

489
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:41,178
- I realise that.
- And that the jury will be quite sceptical

490
00:34:41,435 --> 00:34:45,406
of the word of a man accused of murder
when supported only by that of his wife?

491
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:48,420
- I realise that too.
- Let us, then, at least make sure

492
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:52,336
- the two are not in conflict.
- By all means, let's.

493
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:55,184
I assume you want to
help your husband?

494
00:34:55,407 --> 00:35:00,857
Of course I want to help Leonard. I want
to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.

495
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:05,175
There. Isn't that more
comfortable for you?

496
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:09,122
Now, Mrs Vole.
This is very important.

497
00:35:09,379 --> 00:35:13,145
On the night of the murder your husband
came home before 9:30. Correct?

498
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:16,713
Precisely. Isn't that
what he wants me to say?

499
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,859
Isn't it the truth?

500
00:35:19,056 --> 00:35:20,865
Of course.

501
00:35:21,058 --> 00:35:23,868
But when I told the police,
I do not think they believed me.

502
00:35:24,102 --> 00:35:27,185
Maybe I didn't say it well.
Maybe because of my accent.

503
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:29,646
My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts

504
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:33,021
we accept the evidence of witnesses
who speak only Bulgarian

505
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:35,804
and who must have an interpreter.

506
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:39,194
We accept the evidence of
deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,

507
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:41,738
as long as they tell the truth.

508
00:35:41,954 --> 00:35:45,197
You're aware that when you're in
the witness box you will be sworn

509
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:48,427
- and you will testify under oath?
- Yes.

510
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:52,390
Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely
and did not go out again.

511
00:35:52,673 --> 00:35:57,634
The truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth. Is that better?

512
00:35:59,346 --> 00:36:04,307
- Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?
- Leonard thinks I do.

513
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:08,250
- Well, do you?
- Am I already under oath?

514
00:36:08,522 --> 00:36:11,731
Whatever your gambit may be,
do you know that, under British law,

515
00:36:11,984 --> 00:36:15,875
you cannot be called to give
testimony damaging to your husband?

516
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:18,282
How very convenient.

517
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,572
We are dealing with
a capital crime.

518
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:24,425
The prosecution will try
to hang your husband.

519
00:36:25,664 --> 00:36:28,235
He is not my husband.

520
00:36:34,673 --> 00:36:37,074
Leonard and I went through
a form of marriage,

521
00:36:37,301 --> 00:36:41,067
but I had a husband living somewhere
in East Germany, in the Russian zone.

522
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:45,146
- Did you tell Leonard?
- I did not. It would have been stupid.

523
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:49,405
He would not have married me and I'd
have been left to starve in the rubble.

524
00:36:49,688 --> 00:36:52,214
But he did marry you and
brought you safely here.

525
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:54,648
Don't you think you
should be grateful?

526
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,908
One can get very
tired of gratitude.

527
00:36:57,112 --> 00:36:59,718
Your husband loves you
very much, does he not?

528
00:36:59,948 --> 00:37:03,111
Leonard? He worships
the ground I walk on.

529
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:05,496
And you?

530
00:37:05,704 --> 00:37:07,991
You want to know too much.

531
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:10,573
Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.

532
00:37:11,752 --> 00:37:16,963
Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.
Your visit has been most reassuring.

533
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:21,827
Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him
an alibi and I shall be very convincing.

534
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:26,938
There will be tears in my eyes when I say
"Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely."

535
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:30,988
You're a very remarkable
woman, Mrs Vole.

536
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:34,598
And you're satisfied, I hope?

537
00:37:36,026 --> 00:37:41,430
- I'm damned if I'm satisfied!
- Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?

538
00:37:41,782 --> 00:37:44,228
That woman's up to something.
But what?

539
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:48,342
The prosecution will break her down in
no time when she's in the witness box.

540
00:37:48,622 --> 00:37:51,990
This case is going to be rather like
the charge of the Light Brigade

541
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:55,892
or one of those Japanese
suicide pilots. Quite one-sided.

542
00:37:56,171 --> 00:37:58,492
With the odds all
on the other side.

543
00:37:58,715 --> 00:38:01,161
I haven't got much
to go on, have I?

544
00:38:01,385 --> 00:38:03,865
The fact is, I've got nothing.

545
00:38:05,055 --> 00:38:07,183
Let me ask you something.

546
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:10,759
Do you believe Leonard
Vole is innocent?

547
00:38:13,855 --> 00:38:15,823
Do you?

548
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:19,597
Do you?

549
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,788
I'm not sure.

550
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:25,436
Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.
Of course, I'll do my best.

551
00:38:25,701 --> 00:38:28,386
It's all right, Brogan-Moore.

552
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,191
I'll take it from here.

553
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:37,430
I have called Dr Harrison and given him
a report on your shocking behaviour.

554
00:38:37,754 --> 00:38:40,121
- Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.
- Sir Wilfrid!

555
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,264
Did you hear me? A match!

556
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:20,936
Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are
going to represent me. I'm very grateful.

557
00:39:21,298 --> 00:39:26,464
I struck a bargain with my doctors. They
exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.

558
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:29,329
- Thank you.
- There's hope that we'll both survive.

559
00:39:29,556 --> 00:39:31,718
- Get into these. We need a photograph.
- Why?

560
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:33,902
This is what you were
wearing that night.

561
00:39:34,102 --> 00:39:37,868
We'll circulate a photo on the chance
that someone saw you on your way home.

562
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:40,515
Over here against the wall, please.

563
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:45,876
Hold it. One more
in profile, please.

564
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:49,516
Do we really need this? My wife knows
what time I came home that night.

565
00:39:49,785 --> 00:39:52,391
A disinterested witness
may be of more value.

566
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:55,386
Yes, of course, Christine
is an interested witness.

567
00:39:55,624 --> 00:39:57,831
I'll pick up the negatives later.
Thank you.

568
00:39:58,043 --> 00:40:02,014
I don't understand it.
Why hasn't she come to see me?

569
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,742
Won't they let her see me?
I mean, it's been two weeks now.

570
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,536
Mayhew, give me the reports.

571
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:12,812
Have you been talking to her?
Is there something the matter?

572
00:40:13,058 --> 00:40:17,985
I want to read a portion of the evidence
of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.

573
00:40:22,234 --> 00:40:25,681
"Mr Vole helped Mrs French
with her business affairs,

574
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:27,994
particularly her
income tax returns."

575
00:40:28,198 --> 00:40:31,008
Oh, yes, I did. Some of those
forms are very complicated.

576
00:40:31,243 --> 00:40:34,406
There's also a hint you may have
helped her draft her new will.

577
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:37,553
Well, that's not true!
If Janet said that she's lying.

578
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:40,397
She was always against me,
I don't know why!

579
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:46,589
It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into
the wheels of her Victorian household.

580
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:50,574
Now, this cut in your wrist. You
say you cut yourself with a knife?

581
00:40:50,846 --> 00:40:54,407
Well, that's true, I did. I was
cutting bread and the knife slipped.

582
00:40:54,683 --> 00:41:01,134
But that was two days after. Christine was
there. She'll tell them in her evidence.

583
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:06,654
Are you keeping something from me?
Is she ill? Was she shocked?

584
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:10,836
All things considered, she took it well.
Though that may be only on the surface.

585
00:41:11,116 --> 00:41:14,484
Wives are often profoundly
disturbed at such a time.

586
00:41:14,745 --> 00:41:17,635
Yes, it must be hard. We've
never been separated before.

587
00:41:17,873 --> 00:41:22,037
- Not since our first meeting.
- How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?

588
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:24,304
In Germany in 1945.

589
00:41:25,505 --> 00:41:30,955
It's rather funny. The very first time
I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.

590
00:41:31,303 --> 00:41:34,910
I was stationed outside Hamburg,
with an RAF maintenance unit.

591
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:37,833
I'd just installed a
shower in the officers'

592
00:41:37,846 --> 00:41:40,507
billet, so they gave
me a weekend pass.

Well, it's your own fault. That costume
in the picture gave the boys ideas

635
00:45:24,494 --> 00:45:28,704
- then those trousers let them down hard.
- That costume went in the first raid.

Then raid by raid, my other dresses,

I've got a tin of coffee.

How much?

642
00:45:53,065 --> 00:45:55,147
I don't know. What's
the rate of exchange?

643
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,159
- Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.
- It's instant coffee.

644
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:01,414
Got any hot water at your place?

645
00:46:01,615 --> 00:46:04,903
- Sometimes.
- Let's take a chance. Where do you live?

646
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,730
Nearby.

Come.

Sorry, it's the maid's night off.

649
00:46:18,131 --> 00:46:21,613
This is pretty horrible.
In a gemütlich sort of way.

650
00:46:21,885 --> 00:46:25,332
Oh, it's fine now. I used to
have a roommate. A dancer.

651
00:46:25,597 --> 00:46:28,840
She had luck, she married a Canadian.
She now lives in Toronto.

652
00:46:29,101 --> 00:46:31,752
She has a Ford automobile.

653
00:46:31,979 --> 00:46:34,949
Make yourself comfortable,
the stove is slow these days.

654
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,319
That's all right,
I've got a weekend pass.

655
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:42,051
No, not that chair. It holds up the
beam and that holds up the ceiling.

656
00:46:42,322 --> 00:46:44,609
You'd better sit down on the cot.

657
00:46:44,825 --> 00:46:46,475
The cot?

658
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,062
Getting more gemütlich all
the time. Are you married?

659
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:52,173
- Why?
- Well, the, um...

660
00:46:52,374 --> 00:46:54,900
Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.

661
00:46:55,127 --> 00:46:58,893
I just wear it when I'm working. Gives
a little protection with all the men.

- Didn't work too well tonight, did it?
- No, tonight was bad.

00:47:04,052 --> 00:47:06,214
But it's getting better.

664
00:47:10,017 --> 00:47:13,066
- Where's the coffee?
- Ah, coffee, ja voll.

665
00:47:13,312 --> 00:47:19,274
Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand
that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.

666
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:38,652
Is that a fair rate of exchange?

667
00:47:38,879 --> 00:47:40,847
Very fair.

668
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,970
Would you be interested
in having the whole tin?

669
00:47:46,261 --> 00:47:48,229
I would.

powdered eggs,

689
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:19,030
It was wonderful. I rented
a little flat, Edgware Road.

690
00:49:19,313 --> 00:49:22,681
First time she saw it, she was so
happy she broke down and cried.

691
00:49:22,941 --> 00:49:27,469
Naturally. She had a solid roof over

You don't know her, how she feels about

You're not? Why not?

695
00:49:41,501 --> 00:49:45,108
She's a foreigner, unfamiliar with

698
00:49:51,178 --> 00:49:55,228
Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll

00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:50,908
except what will take
place in this court.

724
00:51:51,173 --> 00:51:54,575
You may proceed for the
prosecution, Mr Myers.

725
00:51:54,843 --> 00:51:58,245
May it please you, my lord.
Members of the jury,

726
00:51:58,513 --> 00:52:03,075
I appear in this case with my learned
friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.

727
00:52:03,393 --> 00:52:07,159
And my learned friends Sir Wilfrid
Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore

728
00:52:07,439 --> 00:52:09,407
appear for the defence.

729
00:52:13,487 --> 00:52:15,728
I trust we are not to be deprived

730
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:18,758
of the learned and stimulating
presence of Sir Wilfrid?

731
00:52:18,992 --> 00:52:23,156
My lord, may I assure my learned friend
that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.

732
00:52:23,455 --> 00:52:26,538
He's slightly incapacitated,
but will be in his seat presently.

733
00:52:26,792 --> 00:52:31,753
My lord, may I express my regret that Sir
Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.

734
00:52:32,089 --> 00:52:37,300
You may, Mr Myers. You may also proceed
with the case for the prosecution.

735
00:52:37,636 --> 00:52:39,798
Thank you, my lord.

736
00:52:40,013 --> 00:52:43,813
The facts in this case are simple
and, to a point, not in dispute.

737
00:52:44,101 --> 00:52:48,072
You will hear how the prisoner made
the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French,

738
00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:49,880
a woman of 56.

739
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:54,309
How he was treated by her with
kindness and even affection.

740
00:52:54,611 --> 00:52:57,091
On the night of October 14 last,

741
00:52:57,322 --> 00:53:01,168
between 9:30 and 10,
Mrs French was murdered.

742
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:04,857
Medical testimony will
be introduced to prove

743
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,289
that death was caused by a blow
from a blunt and heavy instrument,

744
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:11,068
and it is the case
for the prosecution

745
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:14,378
that the blow was dealt by
the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

746
00:53:14,631 --> 00:53:16,599
That's not true! I didn't do it!

747
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,800
<font color="#808080">(MURMURING)</font>

748
00:53:19,344 --> 00:53:21,995
Among the witnesses,
you will hear police evidence,

749
00:53:22,222 --> 00:53:25,908
also the evidence of Mrs French's
housekeeper, Janet McKenzie,

750
00:53:26,184 --> 00:53:28,869
and from the medical and
laboratory experts,

751
00:53:29,104 --> 00:53:34,554
and the evidence of the murdered woman's
solicitor, who drew her final will.

752
00:53:34,902 --> 00:53:38,543
I now call Chief Inspector Hearne,
Criminal Investigation Department,

753
00:53:38,822 --> 00:53:41,553
- New Scotland Yard.
- <font color="#804040">MAN</font>: Chief Inspector Hearne.

754
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:44,753
- Chief Inspector Hearne.
- Chief Inspector Hearne.

755
00:54:02,804 --> 00:54:07,287
This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.
I always get it the first day of a trial.

756
00:54:07,601 --> 00:54:10,172
240 above 130. You
shouldn't be here at all.

757
00:54:10,395 --> 00:54:13,399
- I should be in court, the trial's begun.
- Syringe, please.

758
00:54:13,649 --> 00:54:15,970
Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.

759
00:54:16,193 --> 00:54:19,879
It may interest you to know that I
am descended from a warrior family

760
00:54:20,155 --> 00:54:25,321
which traces it's brave past back
to Richard the Lion-Hearted.

761
00:54:27,913 --> 00:54:30,041
You're to have a calcium
injection daily,

762
00:54:30,249 --> 00:54:33,970
- tranquillising pill every hour.
- I'll set my wristwatch alarm.

763
00:54:34,253 --> 00:54:38,099
Any pain or shortness of breath, pop
one of these nitroglycerin tablets

764
00:54:38,382 --> 00:54:41,033
under your tongue. Oh, and
I'll leave you some...

765
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,345
That's enough, Doctor. The judge
will be asking for a saliva test.

766
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:50,042
Carter, I'd better take that
Thermos of cocoa with me.

767
00:54:50,352 --> 00:54:53,083
- Helps me wash down the pills.
- Let me see it, please.

768
00:54:53,313 --> 00:54:58,479
My learned patient is not above
substituting brandy for cocoa.

769
00:54:58,819 --> 00:55:01,265
It is cocoa. So sorry.

770
00:55:01,488 --> 00:55:04,412
If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,
I would strike you.

771
00:55:04,658 --> 00:55:07,229
Take care of this, Carter.

772
00:55:08,996 --> 00:55:12,523
Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom,
you must avoid overexcitement.

773
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:14,156
Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.

774
00:55:14,334 --> 00:55:16,940
Watch your temper. Keep
your blood pressure down.

775
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:21,539
Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe,
what with the pills and the cocoa.

776
00:55:21,842 --> 00:55:23,810
Come along, Carter.

777
00:55:25,053 --> 00:55:27,943
From the body temperature
and other factors,

778
00:55:28,181 --> 00:55:31,788
we placed the time of death
at between 9:30 and 10pm,

779
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:37,351
approximately 30 minutes before Janet
McKenzie returned home and called us.

780
00:55:38,191 --> 00:55:43,595
Death was instantaneous, caused by one
blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.

781
00:55:43,947 --> 00:55:46,029
Were there any signs of a struggle?

782
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:48,482
None. Just the one blow.

783
00:55:48,702 --> 00:55:52,502
Would that indicate that the murderer
had taken Mrs French by surprise?

784
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:55,952
My lord, I must object.

785
00:55:56,919 --> 00:56:00,446
My learned friend refers to the
assailant as "the murderer".

786
00:56:00,714 --> 00:56:04,161
We have not yet determined whether
the assailant was a man or a woman.

787
00:56:04,426 --> 00:56:07,270
It could quite conceivably
have been "the murderess".

788
00:56:07,512 --> 00:56:13,235
Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in
time to catch you on a point of grammar.

789
00:56:13,602 --> 00:56:15,684
Please rephrase your question.

790
00:56:15,896 --> 00:56:21,699
Yes, my lord. Inspector, is it
your opinion that the assailant,

791
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:26,074
whether he, she or it, had
taken Mrs French by surprise?

792
00:56:26,365 --> 00:56:28,493
My lord, I am taken by surprise

793
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,032
that my learned friend
should try to solicit

794
00:56:31,045 --> 00:56:33,388
from the witness an
opinion, not a fact.

795
00:56:33,705 --> 00:56:36,515
Quite so. You'll have to do
better than that, Mr Myers.

796
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,991
My lord, I withdraw the
question entirely.

797
00:56:39,211 --> 00:56:41,782
- Is that better?
- That's much better.

798

<font color="#808080">(MURMURING)</font>

799
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:49,528
Silence! Silence!

800

<font color="#808080">(GAVEL)</font>

801
00:56:52,891 --> 00:56:55,701
Very well, Inspector, let
us proceed with the facts.

802
00:56:55,936 --> 00:57:00,180
After establishing the 'cause and the
time of death, what did you then do?

803
00:57:00,482 --> 00:57:04,168
A search was made, photographs were
taken and the premises fingerprinted.

804
00:57:04,444 --> 00:57:08,449
- What fingerprints did you discover?
- I found the fingerprints of Mrs French,

805
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:13,029
those of Janet McKenzie, and some which
later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.

806
00:57:13,328 --> 00:57:15,456
- No others?
- No others.

807
00:57:15,664 --> 00:57:20,272
Did you say the room had the appearance
that a robbery had been committed?

808
00:57:20,586 --> 00:57:25,752
Yes. Things were strewn about and the
window had been broken near the catch.

809
00:57:26,091 --> 00:57:29,937
There was glass on the floor,
and fragments were found outside.

810
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:35,465
The glass outside was not consistent with
the window being forced from the outside.

811
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:42,260
You're saying that someone made it look as
if it had been forced from the outside?

812
00:57:42,649 --> 00:57:46,859
My lord, I must object. My learned friend
is putting words in the witness' mouth.

813
00:57:47,154 --> 00:57:49,964
After all, if he insists on
answering his own questions,

814
00:57:50,198 --> 00:57:53,486
the presence of the witness
would seem superfluous.

815
00:57:53,744 --> 00:57:56,111
Quite. Don't you
think so, Mr Myers?

816
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:58,298
Yes, my lord.

817
00:57:59,499 --> 00:58:00,864
Inspector,

818
00:58:01,043 --> 00:58:04,525
did you ascertain if any of the
murdered woman's property was missing?

819
00:58:04,796 --> 00:58:07,766
According to the housekeeper,
nothing was missing.

820
00:58:08,008 --> 00:58:13,412
In your experience, Inspector,
when burglars or burglaresses

821
00:58:13,764 --> 00:58:17,530
break into a house, do they
leave without taking anything?

822
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:18,890
No, sir.

823
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:21,871
- Do you produce a jacket, Inspector?
- Yes, sir.

824
00:58:22,105 --> 00:58:24,267
Is that the jacket?

825
00:58:27,569 --> 00:58:31,255
- Yes, sir.
- That is exhibit P1, my lord.

826
00:58:31,531 --> 00:58:33,499
Where did you find this, Inspector?

827
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,180
That is the jacket found
in the prisoner's flat,

828
00:58:36,411 --> 00:58:38,812
which I handed to our lab
to test for bloodstains.

829
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:41,406
- And did you find any bloodstains?
- Yes.

830
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:44,105
Though an attempt had been
made to wash them out.

831
00:58:44,336 --> 00:58:46,145
What tests were made?

832
00:58:46,338 --> 00:58:50,388
First to determine if the
stains were human blood,

833
00:58:50,676 --> 00:58:52,997
then to classify it
by group or type.

834
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,791
And was the blood of a
particular group or type?

835
00:58:56,014 --> 00:58:58,824
Yes, sir. It is type O.

836
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:02,222
And did you subsequently test
the blood of the dead woman?

837
00:59:02,479 --> 00:59:04,720
- Yes, sir.
- What type was that?

838
00:59:06,233 --> 00:59:08,554
- The same. Type O.
- <font color="#808080">(MURMURING)</font>

839
00:59:08,777 --> 00:59:12,418
Thank you, Inspector.
No further questions.

840
00:59:12,698 --> 00:59:17,545
Inspector, you say the only fingerprints
you found were those of Mrs French,

841
00:59:17,869 --> 00:59:20,190
Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.

842
00:59:20,414 --> 00:59:25,181
In your experience, when a burglar breaks
in, does he usually leave fingerprints

843
00:59:25,502 --> 00:59:27,789
- or does he wear gloves?
- He wears gloves.

844
00:59:28,005 --> 00:59:30,246
So the absence of
fingerprints in a robbery

845
00:59:30,465 --> 00:59:32,593
- would hardly surprise you?
- No, sir.

846
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:36,647
Can't we surmise the burglar might
have entered a presumably empty house,

847
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:39,536
suddenly encountered Mrs
French and struck her,

848
00:59:39,766 --> 00:59:42,975
then, realising she was dead,
fled without taking anything?

849
00:59:43,228 --> 00:59:45,708
I submit, my lord, that
it is entirely impossible

850
00:59:45,939 --> 00:59:50,342
to guess what went on in the mind
of some entirely imaginary burglar.

851
00:59:50,652 --> 00:59:52,814
With or without gloves.

852
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:56,796
Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid,
but confine ourselves to facts.

853
00:59:59,286 --> 01:00:03,371
Inspector, when you questioned the
prisoner as to the stains on his jacket,

854
01:00:03,665 --> 01:00:07,556
did he not show you a
recently-healed scar on his wrist,

855
01:00:07,836 --> 01:00:12,398
- saying he had cut himself slicing bread?
- Yes, sir, that is what he said.

856
01:00:12,716 --> 01:00:15,367
And were you not told the
same thing by his wife?

857
01:00:15,594 --> 01:00:19,315
- Yes, sir. But afterwards...
- Just a simple yes or no, please.

858
01:00:19,598 --> 01:00:21,885
Did the prisoner's
wife show you a knife

859
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:25,991
and tell you that her husband had
cut his wrist while slicing bread?

860
01:00:26,271 --> 01:00:30,720
- Yes, sir.
- I will ask you to examine this knife.

861
01:00:35,113 --> 01:00:38,640
Just test the edge of it
with your finger. Carefully!

862
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:42,755
You agree that the point and the
cutting edge are razor-sharp?

863
01:00:43,038 --> 01:00:45,405
- Yes, sir.
- Now, if such a knife were to slip,

864
01:00:45,624 --> 01:00:48,548
might it not inflict a cut
that would bleed profusely?

865
01:00:48,794 --> 01:00:49,955
Yes, sir, it might.

866
01:00:50,128 --> 01:00:55,055
Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains
on the prisoner's jacket were analysed,

867
01:00:55,384 --> 01:01:00,151
as was the blood of Mrs French, and
they were both found to be of group O.

868
01:01:00,472 --> 01:01:02,839
- That is correct.
- However,

869
01:01:03,058 --> 01:01:06,380
if the prisoner's blood were
also of this same group,

870
01:01:06,645 --> 01:01:09,251
then the stains on his jacket
may well have resulted

871
01:01:09,481 --> 01:01:12,087
from the household accident
he described to you.

872
01:01:12,317 --> 01:01:14,638
Yes, sir.

873
01:01:14,861 --> 01:01:18,502
Did you examine the
prisoner's blood, Inspector?

874
01:01:18,782 --> 01:01:20,272
No, sir.

875
01:01:22,035 --> 01:01:24,800
I have here a certificate

876
01:01:25,038 --> 01:01:29,168
stating that Leonard Stephen
Vole is a blood donor

877
01:01:29,459 --> 01:01:31,666
at the North London Hospital.

878
01:01:31,879 --> 01:01:35,167
And that his blood is group O.

01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:42,337
Thank you, Inspector.

881
01:01:45,392 --> 01:01:49,920
Inspector, granted that the cut on
the wrist was caused by that knife,

882
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:53,200
is there anything to show
whether it was an accident

883
01:01:53,442 --> 01:01:57,367
or done deliberately after the murder
to account for the bloodstains?

884
01:01:57,654 --> 01:02:00,339
- Oh, really, my lord!
- I withdraw the question.

885
01:02:00,574 --> 01:02:01,939
You may stand down.

886
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:07,760
- Call Janet McKenzie.

- Your name is Janet McKenzie?
- Aye, that's my name.

893
01:02:49,957 --> 01:02:54,758
- When did you first come to London?
- That was many years ago. 28 years ago.

894
01:02:55,087 --> 01:02:59,411
- Where do you live?
- Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,

895
01:02:59,716 --> 01:03:03,323
I've moved in with my niece
at 19 Glenister Road.

896
01:03:03,595 --> 01:03:06,724
You were companion-housekeeper
to the late Mrs Emily French?

897
01:03:06,974 --> 01:03:10,023
I was her housekeeper!
I've no opinion of companions,

898
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:13,432
poor feckless bodies, afraid of
a bit of honest domestic work.

899
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:18,695
I meant you were on friendly terms, not
altogether those of mistress and servant.

900
01:03:19,027 --> 01:03:22,031
Aye. Ten years I was with
her and looked after her.

901
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:24,852
She knew me and she trusted me.

902
01:03:25,075 --> 01:03:27,840
Many's the time I prevented
her doing a foolish thing.

903
01:03:28,078 --> 01:03:32,766
Please tell us, in your own words, about
the events of the evening of October 14.

904
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:37,558
It was a Friday and my night out. I was
going to see my niece at Glenister Road,

905
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:42,127
which is about five minutes' walk.
I left the house at half past seven.

906
01:03:42,426 --> 01:03:46,511
I promised to take her a dress
pattern that she admired.

907
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:50,287
- Och, is this thing necessary?
- An excellent question.

908
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,803
However, it has been installed at
considerable expense to the taxpayers,

909
01:03:55,105 --> 01:03:58,632
so let us take advantage of it.
Please continue.

910
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:02,542
Well, when I got to my niece's,
I found I'd left the pattern behind.

911
01:04:02,821 --> 01:04:06,109
So after supper I slipped back
to get it as it was no distance.

912
01:04:06,366 --> 01:04:09,529
I got back to the
house at 25 past 9.

913
01:04:09,786 --> 01:04:12,027
I let myself in and went
upstairs to my room.

914
01:04:12,247 --> 01:04:17,253
As I passed the sitting room, I heard the
prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.

915
01:04:17,586 --> 01:04:21,557
- No, it wasn't me! It wasn't my voice!
- <font color="#808080">(COURT MURMURS)</font>

916
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,808
Talking and laughing they were.

917
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:27,411
But it was no business of mine, so I
went upstairs to fetch my pattern.

918
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:30,967
Now, let us be very
exact as to the time.

919
01:04:31,225 --> 01:04:34,991
You say that you re-entered
the house at 25 past 9?

920
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:39,514
Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my
room next to my clock so I saw the time.

921
01:04:39,816 --> 01:04:44,105
- And it was 25 past 9.
- Go on, please.

922
01:04:44,404 --> 01:04:50,173
I went back to my niece. Och, she was
delighted with the pattern. Si...

923
01:04:52,287 --> 01:04:58,374
Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 11,
then I said good night and I come home.

924
01:04:58,752 --> 01:05:02,393
I went into the sitting room to see
if the mistress wanted anything

925
01:05:02,673 --> 01:05:04,641
before she went to bed.

926
01:05:04,841 --> 01:05:09,210
And there she was, dead. And
everything tossed hither and thither.

927
01:05:09,513 --> 01:05:12,323
Did you really think that a
burglary had been committed?

928
01:05:12,558 --> 01:05:14,526
My lord, I must protest!

929
01:05:14,726 --> 01:05:18,731
I will not allow that question
to be answered, Mr Myers.

930
01:05:19,022 --> 01:05:22,788
Miss McKenzie, were you aware that
Leonard Vole was a married man?

931
01:05:23,068 --> 01:05:25,833
No, indeed. And neither
was the mistress.

932
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:28,039
- Janet!
- My lord, I must object.

933
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:33,007
What Mrs French knew or did not know is
pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.

934
01:05:34,705 --> 01:05:36,992
Let me put it this way.
You formed the opinion

935
01:05:37,207 --> 01:05:40,575
that Mrs French thought Leonard
Vole was a single man?

936
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:44,204
- Have you any facts to support this?
- The books that she ordered.

937
01:05:44,464 --> 01:05:49,152
A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
and the one about Disraeli and his wife.

938
01:05:49,469 --> 01:05:53,360
Both of them about women that married
men years younger than themselves. Oh!

939
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,167
- I knew what she was thinking.
- I'm afraid we cannot admit that.

940
01:05:57,436 --> 01:05:59,962
- Why?
- <font color="#808080">(LAUGHTER)</font>

941
01:06:00,188 --> 01:06:05,194
Members of the jury, it is possible for
a woman to read The Life of Disraeli

942
01:06:05,527 --> 01:06:09,498
without contemplating marriage
with a man younger than herself.

943
01:06:09,781 --> 01:06:11,863
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHTER)</font>

944
01:06:12,075 --> 01:06:17,206
Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs
French made to dispose of her money?

945
01:06:17,539 --> 01:06:20,907
She had her old will revoked
and a new one drawn up.

946
01:06:21,168 --> 01:06:23,489
I heard her calling Mr Stokes,
her solicitor.

947
01:06:23,712 --> 01:06:26,556
He was there at the time.
The prisoner, I mean.

948
01:06:27,174 --> 01:06:30,496
You heard Mrs French and the
prisoner discussing her new will?

949
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:33,492
Yes. He was to have all
her money, she told him,

950
01:06:33,722 --> 01:06:37,966
as she had no near relations nor
anybody that meant to her what he did.

951
01:06:38,268 --> 01:06:41,556
- When did this take place?
- On October 8.

952
01:06:41,813 --> 01:06:44,976
One week to the day
before she was murdered.

953
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:48,363
Thank you. That concludes
my examination.

954
01:06:49,404 --> 01:06:51,975
Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.

955
01:06:53,158 --> 01:06:56,207
Would you...? Thank you.

956
01:06:56,453 --> 01:07:00,663
Miss McKenzie, you have given
evidence about two wills.

957
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:02,926
In the old will, that
which was revoked,

958
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:06,812
were you not to receive the
bulk of Mrs French's estate?

959
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:08,250
That's so.

960
01:07:08,423 --> 01:07:12,553
Whereas in the new will, except for a
bequest to you of a small annuity,

961
01:07:12,844 --> 01:07:16,371
the principal beneficiary is
the prisoner, Leonard Vole.

962
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:20,281
It'll be a wicked injustice if he
ever touches a penny of that money.

963
01:07:20,561 --> 01:07:24,725
It is entirely understandable that you
are antagonistic to the prisoner.

964
01:07:25,023 --> 01:07:27,503
I'm not antagonistic to him.

965
01:07:27,734 --> 01:07:31,580
He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.
But I'm not antagonistic to him.

966
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:32,756
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHTER)</font>

967
01:07:32,781 --> 01:07:34,749
I suggest you formed this opinion

968
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:38,591
because his friendship with Mrs French
cost you the bulk of her estate.

969
01:07:38,871 --> 01:07:42,876
- I've never liked him.
- Your candour is refreshing.

970
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:45,772
Now. On the night of October 14

971
01:07:46,003 --> 01:07:49,166
you say you heard the prisoner
and Mrs French talking together.

972
01:07:49,423 --> 01:07:52,745
- What did you hear them say?
- I didn't hear what they actually said.

973
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:55,456
You mean you only heard the voices?

974
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:58,410
- The murmur of voices?
- They were laughing.

975
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,644
What makes you say the man's
voice was Leonard Vole's?

976
01:08:01,894 --> 01:08:06,104
- I know his voice well enough.
- The door was closed, was it not?

977
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:09,720
- Aye, that's so.
- You were in a hurry to get the pattern

978
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:12,795
so you probably walked quickly
past the closed door,

979
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:15,636
yet you are sure you heard
Leonard Vole's voice?

980
01:08:15,866 --> 01:08:18,551
I was there long enough
to hear what I heard.

981
01:08:18,785 --> 01:08:24,747
Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest
to the jury that you were eavesdropping.

982
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:27,571
It was him in there.
Who else could it have been?

983
01:08:27,794 --> 01:08:31,924
What you mean is that you wanted it to
be him. That's the way your mind worked.

984
01:08:32,216 --> 01:08:36,141
Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes
watch television in the evening?

985
01:08:36,428 --> 01:08:39,318
Yes. She was fond of a
talk or a good play.

986
01:08:39,556 --> 01:08:42,685
Wasn't it possible when you
returned home and passed the door,

987
01:08:42,935 --> 01:08:45,017
what you really heard
was the television

988
01:08:45,229 --> 01:08:47,709
and a man and woman's
voices and laughter?

989
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:52,229
There was a play called Lover's
Leap on the television that night.

990
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:57,814
- It was not the television.
- Oh, why not?

991
01:08:58,116 --> 01:09:02,963
Because the television was away being
repaired that week, that's why.

992
01:09:03,288 --> 01:09:04,938
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHTER)</font>

994
01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:15,608
Silence! Silence!

995
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:20,390
Odd. It's not time yet.

996
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:23,563
If my learned friend has no
further questions, I'd like...

997
01:09:23,809 --> 01:09:26,779
I have not quite finished.

998
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:31,469
You are registered, are you not, under
the National Health Insurance Act?

999
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:35,382
Aye, that's so. Four and
sixpence I pay out every week.

1000
01:09:35,654 --> 01:09:38,578
That's a terrible lot of money
for a working woman to pay.

1001
01:09:38,824 --> 01:09:41,634
I am sure that many agree with you.

1002
01:09:41,869 --> 01:09:48,036
Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply
to the National Health Insurance for...

1003
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,899
- <font color="#808080">(QUIETLY)</font> ...a hearing aid?
- For... for what?

1004
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:55,060
I protest against the way in
which this question was put!

1005
01:09:55,299 --> 01:09:58,269
I will repeat the
question, my lord.

1006
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:04,233
I asked you in a normal tone of voice,
audible to everyone in open court,

1007
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,288
did you apply to the National
Health Insurance for a hearing aid?

1008
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:10,606
Yes, I did.

1009
01:10:10,772 --> 01:10:13,093
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.

1010
01:10:13,317 --> 01:10:18,403
However, you state that you walked past
a door, which is four inches of solid oak,

1011
01:10:18,739 --> 01:10:21,822
you heard voices,
and you are willing to swear

1012
01:10:22,075 --> 01:10:25,045
that you could distinguish
the voice of...

Och, maybe you could
help me, Your Lordship.

1018
01:10:37,799 --> 01:10:41,724
Six months ago I applied for my hearing

1019
01:10:42,012 --> 01:10:46,779
My dear Miss McKenzie, considering the
rubbish that is being talked nowadays,

1020

Call Police Constable Jeffries.

1023
01:10:56,109 --> 01:11:00,239
- Police Constable Jeffries.
- Police Constable Jeffries.

1024
01:11:10,958 --> 01:11:13,689
I swear by Almighty God that
the evidence I shall give

1025
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:18,800
shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

1026
01:11:32,271 --> 01:11:35,036
Mr Myers, does that
conclude your case?

1027
01:11:35,274 --> 01:11:40,075
No, my lord. I now call the final witness
for the prosecution, Christine Helm.

1028
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:44,067
- Christine Helm!
- Christine Helm.

1029
01:11:55,836 --> 01:11:57,804
Christine.

1030
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:11,330
I swear by Almighty God that
the evidence I shall give

1031
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,042
shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

1032
01:12:15,314 --> 01:12:17,840
My lord, I have the
most serious objection

1033
01:12:18,066 --> 01:12:21,991
to this witness being summoned,
as she is the wife of the prisoner.

1034
01:12:22,279 --> 01:12:24,281
I call my learned
friend's attention

1035
01:12:24,489 --> 01:12:28,858
to the fact that I summoned
not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.

1036
01:12:29,161 --> 01:12:33,086
- Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?
- Yes. Christine Helm.

1037
01:12:33,373 --> 01:12:36,855
And you have been living as the
wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?

1038
01:12:37,127 --> 01:12:39,698
- Yes.
- Are you actually his wife?

1039
01:12:40,339 --> 01:12:41,829
No.

1040
01:12:42,007 --> 01:12:46,331
I went through a marriage ceremony
with him, but I already had a husband.

1041
01:12:46,637 --> 01:12:49,163
- He's still alive.
- Christine, that's not true!

1042
01:12:49,389 --> 01:12:52,711
There is proof of a marriage between
the witness and the prisoner,

1043
01:12:52,976 --> 01:12:55,820
but is there any proof of a
so-called previous marriage?

1044
01:12:56,063 --> 01:13:01,467
My lord, the so-called previous
marriage is, in fact, well-documented.

1045
01:13:01,818 --> 01:13:07,587
Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage
between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm,

1046
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:12,478
the ceremony having taken place
in Breslau on 18 April 1942?

1047
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:15,519
Yes, that is the paper
of my marriage.

1048
01:13:15,749 --> 01:13:21,438
I don't see any reason why this witness
should not be qualified to give evidence.

1049
01:13:25,884 --> 01:13:30,253
You're willing to give evidence against
the man you've been calling your husband?

1050
01:13:30,556 --> 01:13:31,967
Yes.

1051
01:13:32,683 --> 01:13:36,290
You stated to the police that on the
night that Mrs French was murdered,

1052
01:13:36,562 --> 01:13:41,602
Leonard Vole left the house at 7:30
and returned at 25 minutes past 9.

1053
01:13:41,942 --> 01:13:44,468
Did he, in fact,
return at 25 past 9?

1054
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:49,287
No. He returned at ten
minutes past ten.

1055
01:13:49,533 --> 01:13:54,016
Christine, what are you saying?
It's not true. You know it's not true!

1056
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:55,740
<font color="#808080">(MURMURING)</font>

1057
01:13:57,791 --> 01:13:59,839
Silence!

1058
01:14:00,043 --> 01:14:02,011
I must have silence.

1059
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:06,395
As your counsel will tell you,
Vole, you will very shortly

1060
01:14:06,633 --> 01:14:09,477
have an opportunity of
speaking in your own defence.

1061
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:13,691
Leonard Vole returned, you say,
at ten minutes past ten.

1062
01:14:13,974 --> 01:14:17,376
- And what happened next?
- He was breathing hard, very excited.

1063
01:14:17,644 --> 01:14:20,250
He threw off his coat and
examined the sleeves.

1064
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,608
Then he told me to wash the cuffs.

1065
01:14:22,816 --> 01:14:24,898
- They had blood on them.
- Go on.

1066
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:28,000
- I said "What have you done?"
- What did the prisoner say?

1067
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:30,400
He said "I've killed her."

1068
01:14:30,616 --> 01:14:34,940
Christine! Why are you lying?
Why are you saying these things?

1069
01:14:35,245 --> 01:14:39,250
- What an awful woman.
- She's evil. I've known it all along.

1070
01:14:42,669 --> 01:14:45,991
If the defence so desires,
I will adjourn for a short time

1071
01:14:46,256 --> 01:14:49,305
so that the prisoner may
gain control of himself.

1072
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:53,158
My lord is most gracious, but
pray let the witness continue.

1073
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:57,515
We are all of us caught up in the
suspense of this horror fiction.

1074
01:14:57,809 --> 01:15:01,530
To have to hear it in instalments
might prove unendurable.

1075
01:15:01,813 --> 01:15:04,623
- Proceed, Mr Myers.
- Mrs Helm,

1076
01:15:04,858 --> 01:15:09,466
when the prisoner said "I have killed her",
did you know to whom he referred?

1077
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:12,511
It was that woman he had
been seeing so often.

1078
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:17,303
When questioned by the police, you told
them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.

1079
01:15:17,621 --> 01:15:19,908
Yes. Because Leonard
asked me to say that.

1080
01:15:20,123 --> 01:15:22,125
But you've changed
your story now. Why?

1081
01:15:22,334 --> 01:15:24,462
I cannot go on lying to save him.

1082
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:27,879
I said to the police what he wanted
because I'm grateful to him.

1083
01:15:28,131 --> 01:15:30,782
He married me and brought
me to this country.

1084
01:15:31,009 --> 01:15:33,933
What he has asked me to do I
have because I was grateful.

1085
01:15:34,179 --> 01:15:37,103
It was not because he was your
husband and you loved him?

1086
01:15:37,349 --> 01:15:39,317
I never loved him.

1087
01:15:39,893 --> 01:15:42,942
It was gratitude, then, that
prompted you to give him an alibi

1088
01:15:43,188 --> 01:15:46,556
- in your statement to the police?
- That is it. Exactly.

1089
01:15:46,817 --> 01:15:50,219
- But now you think it was wrong to do so.
- Because it is murder.

1090
01:15:50,487 --> 01:15:52,535
That woman, she was a
harmless old fool,

1091
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:55,185
and he makes of me an
accomplice to the murder.

1092
01:15:55,409 --> 01:15:59,255
I cannot come into court and swear that
he was with me at the time it was done.

1093
01:15:59,538 --> 01:16:02,109
I cannot do it! I cannot do it!

1094
01:16:02,332 --> 01:16:04,494
Then this is the truth?

1095
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:08,112
That Leonard Vole returned that
night at ten minutes past ten,

1096
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:10,382
he had blood on the
sleeves of his coat,

1097
01:16:10,591 --> 01:16:14,562
and that he said to you
"I have killed her"?

1098
01:16:16,388 --> 01:16:18,072
That is the truth.

1099
01:16:18,265 --> 01:16:21,314
That is the truth, before God?

1100
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,608
That is the truth.

1101
01:16:24,187 --> 01:16:26,155
Thank you.

1102
01:16:31,445 --> 01:16:34,847
Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm, which
do you prefer to be called?

1103
01:16:35,115 --> 01:16:37,083
- It does not matter.
- Does it not?

1104
01:16:37,284 --> 01:16:41,175
In this country we are inclined to take
a rather more serious view of marriage.

1105
01:16:41,455 --> 01:16:46,461
However, it would appear that when you
first met the prisoner in Hamburg

1106
01:16:46,793 --> 01:16:48,943
you lied to him about
your marital status.

1107
01:16:48,956 --> 01:16:51,117
I wanted to get out
of Germany, so...

1108
01:16:51,423 --> 01:16:54,393
You lied, did you not?
Just yes or no, please.

1109
01:16:54,635 --> 01:16:56,603
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1110
01:16:56,803 --> 01:16:59,773
And in arranging the marriage,
you lied to the authorities?

1111
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:02,825
I, um, did not tell the
truth to the authorities.

1112
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:05,222
- You lied to them?
- Yes.

1113
01:17:05,437 --> 01:17:09,647
And in the ceremony, when you swore to
love, honour and cherish your husband,

1114
01:17:09,942 --> 01:17:12,343
- that too was a lie?
- Yes.

1115
01:17:12,569 --> 01:17:15,698
And when the police questioned
you about this wretched man

1116
01:17:15,948 --> 01:17:18,269
who believed himself
married and loved,

1117
01:17:18,492 --> 01:17:20,893
- you told them...
- I told them what he wanted me to.

1118
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:24,805
You told them that he was at home
with you at 25 minutes past 9,

1119
01:17:25,082 --> 01:17:29,212
- and now you say that that was a lie?
- Yes, a lie!

1120
01:17:29,503 --> 01:17:33,713
And when you said that he had accidentally
cut his wrist, again, you lied?

1121
01:17:34,007 --> 01:17:38,695
- Yes!
- And today you told a new story entirely.

1122
01:17:39,012 --> 01:17:42,414
The question is, Frau Helm, were
you lying then, are you lying now?

1123
01:17:42,683 --> 01:17:46,290
Or are you not, in fact,
a chronic and habitual liar?!

allowed to bully and insult the witness?

1128

Mr Myers, this is a capital charge
and, within the bounds of reason,

1129
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:07,341
I should like the defence
to have every latitude.

1130
01:18:10,669 --> 01:18:13,149
My lord, may I also
remind my learned friend

1131
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:17,146
that his witness, by her own admission,
has already violated so many oaths

1132
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:21,192
that I am surprised the Testament
did not leap from her hand

1133
01:18:21,471 --> 01:18:24,042
when she was sworn here today.

1134
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:28,396
I doubt if anything is to be gained
by questioning you any further.

1135
01:18:28,687 --> 01:18:30,735
That will be all, Frau Helm.

1137
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:40,066
Mrs Helm, I presume you know the
meaning of the English word "perjury"?

1138
01:18:40,365 --> 01:18:43,847
- In German, the word is Meineid.
- Yes. Meineid.

1139
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:46,121
It means to swear
falsely under oath.

1140
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:48,059
And are you aware, Mrs Helm,

1141
01:18:48,248 --> 01:18:53,015
that the penalty in this country for
perjury is a heavy term of imprisonment?

1142
01:18:53,337 --> 01:18:55,704
Yes, I'm aware.

1143
01:18:55,923 --> 01:19:00,485
Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more,
is the evidence that you have given

1144
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:04,284
the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1145
01:19:04,556 --> 01:19:06,445
So help me, God.

1146
01:19:07,684 --> 01:19:11,928
Then that, my lord, is the
case for the prosecution.

1147
01:19:29,873 --> 01:19:33,559
- Want a tissue?
- Yes, thanks.

1148
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:38,363
It's the first murder trial
I've ever been to. It's terrible.

1149
01:19:38,674 --> 01:19:39,674
Silence.

1150
01:19:41,885 --> 01:19:45,446
Sir Wilfrid. Are you
ready for the defence?

1151
01:19:47,766 --> 01:19:51,407
My lord, members of the jury,

1152
01:19:51,687 --> 01:19:56,648
the prosecution has very ably presented
against the prisoner, Leonard Vole,

1153
01:19:56,984 --> 01:20:01,194
a case with the most overwhelming
circumstantial evidence.

1154
01:20:01,488 --> 01:20:04,890
Among the witnesses you have
heard Chief Inspector Hearne,

1155
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:10,039
who has given his testimony in a fair and
impartial manner, as he always does.

1156
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:15,094
He has put before you a clever theory
of how this crime was committed.

1157
01:20:15,419 --> 01:20:19,219
Whether it is theory or
actual fact, however,

1158
01:20:19,506 --> 01:20:21,952
you will decide for yourselves.

1159
01:20:23,093 --> 01:20:26,097
And then you have heard the
evidence of Janet McKenzie,

1160
01:20:26,346 --> 01:20:30,351
a worthy and devoted housekeeper who
has suffered two most grievous losses.

1161
01:20:30,642 --> 01:20:32,883
One, the death of her
beloved mistress

1162
01:20:33,103 --> 01:20:38,553
and, second, in being deprived
of an inheritance of £80,000,

1163
01:20:38,901 --> 01:20:41,586
which she'd fully
expected to receive.

1164
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:45,506
I will not comment
further on her evidence,

1165
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:50,546
but will express only my
deepest sympathy for her

1166
01:20:50,829 --> 01:20:53,594
in both these... mishaps.

1167
01:20:54,666 --> 01:21:00,150
And most damaging of all, the prosecution
has produced a surprise witness,

1168
01:21:00,505 --> 01:21:04,988
one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner
brought from the rubble of her homeland

1169
01:21:05,302 --> 01:21:09,830
to the safety of this country, giving her
his love and the protection of his name.

1170
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:13,747
I objected to her testimony because
a wife cannot give evidence

1171
01:21:14,019 --> 01:21:16,420
harmful to her husband.

1172
01:21:16,647 --> 01:21:23,053
But it has been proven that her marriage
to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.

1173
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:29,373
Therefore, her evidence must be
admitted and you must consider it.

1174
01:21:29,743 --> 01:21:32,508
For what it is worth.

1175
01:21:34,248 --> 01:21:38,492
Such is the prosecution's case.
Now it is the tum of the defence.

1176
01:21:38,794 --> 01:21:42,719
We could present, on behalf of the
prisoner, witnesses to his character,

1177
01:21:43,006 --> 01:21:46,806
his war record, the lack of criminal
or evil association in his past.

1178
01:21:47,094 --> 01:21:52,578
However, only one witness
can shed new light

1179
01:21:52,933 --> 01:21:55,698
on this tragic riddle.

1180
01:21:56,895 --> 01:21:58,863
The prisoner himself.

1181
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:02,481
Members of the jury,

1182
01:22:02,693 --> 01:22:06,140
I call Leonard Stephen Vole.

1183
01:22:25,549 --> 01:22:28,758
I swear by Almighty God that the
evidence I give will be the truth,

1184
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:30,524
the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.

1185
01:22:30,537 --> 01:22:32,060
No.

1186
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:37,395
- Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?
- It is.

1187
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:40,656
- Where do live?
- 620 Edgware Road.

1188
01:22:40,898 --> 01:22:45,984
Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did you
not on the night of October 14 last,

1189
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,482
murder Emily Jane French?

1190
01:22:49,156 --> 01:22:52,922
- I did not.
- Thank you, that will be all.

1191
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:55,045
<font color="#808080">(MUTTERING)</font>

1192
01:22:55,245 --> 01:22:59,534
Have you, in fact, concluded your
examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?

1193
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:04,919
The prisoner has endured three days
of profound mental agony and shock.

1194
01:23:05,255 --> 01:23:07,656
The defence feels his
faculties should be spared

1195
01:23:07,883 --> 01:23:11,330
for the cross-examination by my
learned friend for the prosecution.

1196
01:23:11,595 --> 01:23:14,360
This is not a plea
for any indulgence.

1197
01:23:14,598 --> 01:23:17,522
I am confident that no matter
how searching this may be,

1198
01:23:17,768 --> 01:23:20,533
the prisoner will withstand it.

1199
01:23:22,147 --> 01:23:25,674
At the time you made the acquaintance
of Mrs French, were you employed?

1200
01:23:25,943 --> 01:23:27,911
- No, sir.
- How much money did you have?

1201
01:23:28,111 --> 01:23:30,113
- A few pounds.
- Did she give you any?

1202
01:23:30,322 --> 01:23:31,084
No.

1203
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,368
- Did you expect to receive any?
- No, sir.

1204
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:38,297
Did you know that in her new will,
you were the beneficiary of £80,000?

1205
01:23:38,622 --> 01:23:39,783
No, I didn't.

1206
01:23:39,957 --> 01:23:44,645
Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit
Mrs French for the last time,

1207
01:23:44,962 --> 01:23:48,125
did you wear a trench
coat and a brown hat?

1208
01:23:49,216 --> 01:23:52,743
- Yes, I did.
- Was it this coat and hat?

1209
01:23:54,555 --> 01:23:55,555
Yes, sir.

1210
01:23:55,681 --> 01:24:00,687
My lord, the defence, in it's efforts
to establish an alibi for the prisoner,

1211
01:24:01,019 --> 01:24:04,148
circulated this photograph,
hoping to bring forth a witness

1212
01:24:04,398 --> 01:24:07,481
who had seen him leaving Mrs
French's house or entering his own

1213
01:24:07,734 --> 01:24:10,214
at the times that he has stated.

1214
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:13,767
Apparently, this splendid
effort was without results.

1215
01:24:14,032 --> 01:24:16,319
However, the defence
will be pleased to learn

1216
01:24:16,535 --> 01:24:19,618
that, at the last moment,
a witness has come forward,

1217
01:24:19,872 --> 01:24:24,355
and that the prisoner had been seen
wearing this coat and this hat.

1218
01:24:24,668 --> 01:24:29,879
Lamentably, he had not been seen on the
night of the murder but one week before.

1219
01:24:30,215 --> 01:24:34,345
On the afternoon of October 8, were you
not in a travel agency in Regent Street?

1220
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:38,527
And did you not make inquiries about
prices and schedules of foreign cruises?

1221
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:41,970
Supposing I did?
It's not a crime, is it?

1222
01:24:42,227 --> 01:24:46,198
Not at all. Many people go on a cruise
when they can afford to pay for it.

1223
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:51,328
- But you couldn't pay for it, could you?
- Well, I was hard up. I told you that.

1224
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:56,693
And yet you came to this particular
travel agency with a clinging brunette?

1225
01:24:57,034 --> 01:24:59,355
A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?

1226
01:25:00,245 --> 01:25:02,247
My lord, the lady was
so described to me.

1227
01:25:02,456 --> 01:25:06,745
She was very affectionate with the
prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.

1228
01:25:07,044 --> 01:25:08,933
Oh.

1229
01:25:09,755 --> 01:25:14,158
You then admit that you made inquiries
about expensive and luxurious cruises?

1230
01:25:14,468 --> 01:25:16,550
How did you expect to
pay for such a thing?

1231
01:25:16,762 --> 01:25:19,891
- I don't know. It was...
- If you don't know, perhaps I can help.

1232
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:24,350
On the morning of the very same day,
you heard Mrs French change her will,

1233
01:25:24,645 --> 01:25:26,932
- leaving you the bulk of her money.
- I didn't!

1234
01:25:27,147 --> 01:25:30,117
And in the afternoon, you
started plans to dispose of it.

1235
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:32,487
No! It was nothing of the kind.

1236
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:35,743
I was in a pub and I met a girl.
I don't even remember her name.

1237
01:25:35,989 --> 01:25:38,037
We had a drink and
walked out together.

1238
01:25:38,242 --> 01:25:44,045
We passed the window and saw the fancy
posters, all blue seas and palm trees.

1239
01:25:44,414 --> 01:25:49,500
The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went in
for fun and I started asking for folders.

1240
01:25:49,836 --> 01:25:53,557
Well, the man gave me a funny look
because I did look a bit shabby.

1241
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:57,128
Anyway, it irritated me, so I kept
asking for the swankiest tours,

1242
01:25:57,386 --> 01:26:00,754
all deluxe and cabin on the boat
deck, but it was just an act!

1243
01:26:01,014 --> 01:26:05,019
An act? You knew that in a week
you were going to inherit £80,000!

1244
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:09,679
No! It wasn't that way at all. It was
make-believe and childish but...

1245
01:26:09,982 --> 01:26:12,092
it was fun and I enjoyed it.
I never thought

1246
01:26:12,105 --> 01:26:14,226
of killing anyone or
inheriting any money.

1247
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:18,328
It's just a coincidence that Mrs French
should be killed only one week later?

1248
01:26:18,615 --> 01:26:20,982
I told you! I didn't kill her!

1249
01:26:21,702 --> 01:26:25,627
Do you know any reason why Christine
Helm should give the evidence she has

1250
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:29,600
- if it were not true?
- No. I don't know why my wife...

1251
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:35,500
I don't know why I still call her my wife.
She must be lying or out of her mind.

1252
01:26:35,841 --> 01:26:38,367
She seemed remarkably
sane and self-possessed.

1253
01:26:38,594 --> 01:26:42,918
- But insanity is all you can suggest?
- I don't understand it.

1254
01:26:43,223 --> 01:26:45,669
Oh, God! What's happened?
What's changed her?

1255
01:26:45,893 --> 01:26:49,818
Very effective, I'm sure. But in
this court we deal with fact.

1256
01:26:50,105 --> 01:26:52,915
And the fact, Mr Vole, is that
we've only your word for it.

1257
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:55,960
That you left Mrs French's
house at the time you say,

1258
01:26:56,195 --> 01:27:00,803
that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes
past 9, and that you did not go out again!

1259
01:27:01,116 --> 01:27:04,165
Somebody must have seen me in the
street or going in the house!

1260
01:27:04,411 --> 01:27:08,621
One would think so. But the only person
who did see you come home that night

1261
01:27:08,916 --> 01:27:12,079
says it was ten past ten and that
you had blood on your hands.

1262
01:27:12,336 --> 01:27:15,226
- I cut my wrist!
- You cut your wrist deliberately!

1263
01:27:15,464 --> 01:27:17,432
No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.

1264
01:27:17,633 --> 01:27:20,443
But you make it sound as though
I did. I can hear it myself.

1265
01:27:20,677 --> 01:27:22,805
You came home at ten past ten!

1266
01:27:23,013 --> 01:27:27,223
No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.
You've got to believe me!

1267
01:27:27,517 --> 01:27:29,645
You killed Emily French!

1268
01:27:29,853 --> 01:27:32,094
No, I didn't! I didn't do it!

1269
01:27:32,314 --> 01:27:36,035
I didn't kill her!
I never killed anybody!

1270
01:27:36,318 --> 01:27:40,721
God, it's like a nightmare.
Some ghastly, horrible dream.

1271
01:27:46,578 --> 01:27:48,945
Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.
How did it go today?

1272
01:27:49,164 --> 01:27:51,326
Oh, Sir Wilfrid.

1273
01:27:51,542 --> 01:27:56,673
I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've
brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.

1274
01:27:57,923 --> 01:27:58,923
What?

1275
01:27:59,049 --> 01:28:03,418
- You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.
- I'm in the middle of a murder trial.

1276
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:07,611
It'll all be over by the afternoon, and
the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.

1277
01:28:07,891 --> 01:28:11,179
You work it out. You know my shape,
you've stabbed it often enough.

1278
01:28:11,436 --> 01:28:15,805
Upstairs. You need a lukewarm
bath and your calcium injection.

1279
01:28:16,108 --> 01:28:18,952
And there's a lot more
packing to be done.

1280
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:24,670
It's ridiculous having boat reservations.
The jury may be out for days.

1281
01:28:24,992 --> 01:28:29,156
Not on this case, I'm afraid.
It seems too open-and-shut.

1282
01:28:31,373 --> 01:28:34,855
I watched when Frau Helm was on
the stand. They didn't like her.

1283
01:28:35,127 --> 01:28:39,212
No, but they believed her. They liked
Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.

1284
01:28:39,506 --> 01:28:42,635
And that travel agency business
doesn't help either. Cigar?

1285
01:28:42,819 --> 01:28:43,819
No.

1286
01:28:43,844 --> 01:28:46,529
- Wilfrid, do you think she lied?
- Well, don't you?

1287
01:28:46,763 --> 01:28:48,049
I'm not sure.

1288
01:28:48,223 --> 01:28:51,830
I am. She lied. Whether she calls
it Meineid or perjury, she lied.

1289
01:28:52,102 --> 01:28:56,949
The only question is why. What's
her game? What is she up to? What?

1290
01:28:57,733 --> 01:29:02,694
I hope that in your final speech you
won't become too emotionally involved.

1291
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:05,840
- You must think of your condition.
- He's right.

1292
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:09,476
I want to see you save yourself.
This isn't going to be your last case.

1293
01:29:09,745 --> 01:29:13,352
Yes, it is. But until it's over,
I'm still a barrister.

1294
01:29:13,624 --> 01:29:17,310
My client's life is at stake.
That's all that matters... his life.

1295
01:29:17,586 --> 01:29:20,351
He's entitled to the
best that I can do.

1296
01:29:20,589 --> 01:29:24,480
If I can't stand up to make my final
appeal for him, I'll make it sitting down.

1297
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,830
If I become short of

- Who is this speaking, please?
- Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im.

1303
01:29:48,242 --> 01:29:51,644
I'm afraid that's impossible. What
is the nature of your business?

1304
01:29:51,912 --> 01:29:55,075
It's business all right. I've got
something to sell 'im, I 'ave.

1305
01:29:55,332 --> 01:29:56,538
Well, really, madam!

And what I want to sell 'im,
believe me, 'e'll want to buy.

- It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.
- Leonard Vole?

1308
01:30:03,674 --> 01:30:05,836
It's about that German wife.

1309
01:30:06,051 --> 01:30:09,453
I've got the goods on
her and it's for sale.

Well, hello, ducky.

What is this you said
about Mrs Leonard Vole?

1313
01:30:20,941 --> 01:30:24,662
I'm not just saying.
I've got it in black and white.

1314
01:30:24,945 --> 01:30:27,789
- You've got what?
- Listen to this carefully, ducks.

1315
01:30:28,031 --> 01:30:31,399
I'm at the buffet at Euston Station
at the far end of the bar.

that's when me train leaves.

German bag, get yourself here.

What lowdown?
What do you know about her?

1319
01:30:41,295 --> 01:30:43,377
Uh-uh. Not on the phone.

- Where to, Sir Wilfrid?

- Well, that's all right, then.
- And your name, please?

1340
01:32:18,267 --> 01:32:23,512
No need for mine. If did give you a name
it mightn't be the right one, might it?

01:32:23,855 --> 01:32:27,940
'Ave a drink, boys. Two whiskies
for me gen'lmen friends.

1342
01:32:28,235 --> 01:32:30,715
Now what is this information
you allegedly have?

1343
01:32:30,946 --> 01:32:35,235
You realise that you're duty-bound to
give any evidence that you might have?

1344
01:32:35,534 --> 01:32:39,983
- Come off it. Did you bring any money?
- What is it you have, madam?

1345
01:32:40,289 --> 01:32:44,613
Letters. Letters that German wife
of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.

1346
01:32:44,918 --> 01:32:49,560
- Letters written to the prisoner?
- To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.

1347
01:32:49,882 --> 01:32:53,648
Poor bleeder, he's been took in by 'er
all right. And these letters prove it.

1348
01:32:53,927 --> 01:32:58,888
If we could see these letters, we could
advise you as to how pertinent they are.

1349
01:32:59,224 --> 01:33:01,875
Well, I don't expect you...

1350
01:33:05,188 --> 01:33:09,079
Well, as I say, I don't expect you to
buy without seeing, but fair's fair.

1351
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:13,728
If these letters get the boy off,
it's £100 for me, right?

1352
01:33:14,031 --> 01:33:18,719
If these letters contain information useful
to the defence, I'm prepared to offer £10.

1353
01:33:19,036 --> 01:33:22,324
What? Ten bleeding pounds
for letters like these?

1354
01:33:22,581 --> 01:33:25,312
Take that piece of glass
out o' yer eye. Good night.

1355
01:33:25,542 --> 01:33:27,590
If these help prove my
client's innocence,

1356
01:33:27,794 --> 01:33:31,196
£20 should, I think, not be an
unreasonable sum for your expenses.

1357
01:33:31,465 --> 01:33:34,389
50 and it's a bargain. That's
if you're satisfied with 'em.

1358
01:33:34,635 --> 01:33:36,922
- £40.
- All right, blast yer.

1359
01:33:37,137 --> 01:33:39,902
'Ere, take 'em.
Nice little lot there.

1360
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:42,108
How do we know these
are from Mrs Vole?

1361
01:33:42,309 --> 01:33:46,473
Oh, she wrote 'em all right.
It's all fair an' square.

1362
01:33:49,233 --> 01:33:51,998
I 'ope they fix 'er
good and proper.

1363
01:33:53,987 --> 01:33:57,708
I've had messages from Mrs Vole.
It looks like her handwriting.

1364
01:33:57,991 --> 01:34:00,358
Good heavens, look at this.

1365
01:34:03,038 --> 01:34:05,006
Juicy, ain't they?

1366
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:09,007
- There's one that's even better.
- How did you get hold of these?

1367
01:34:09,294 --> 01:34:12,264
What's the difference so long
as she gets what's coming?

1368
01:34:12,506 --> 01:34:15,555
- What have you got against her?
- Ha!

1369
01:34:15,801 --> 01:34:19,089
I'll give you something
to dream about, mister.

1370
01:34:20,305 --> 01:34:22,672
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1371
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:27,329
Ha!

1372
01:34:27,354 --> 01:34:31,154
- I didn't suppose you would.
- Christine Vole did that to you?

1373
01:34:31,441 --> 01:34:36,208
Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was
a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.

1374
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:41,331
Then she come along, started seeing 'im
on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.

1375
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:46,871
I found 'em together. I said what I thought
of 'er and he cut me face up proper.

1376
01:34:47,207 --> 01:34:51,417
- Did you go to the police about it?
- Who, me? Not likely.

1377
01:34:51,712 --> 01:34:54,465
It wasn't 'is fault. It
was all 'ers, gettin'

1378
01:34:54,478 --> 01:34:57,242
'im away from me,
turnin' 'im against me.

1379
01:34:57,593 --> 01:35:02,315
But I waited me time to pay
'er back. And it's come now.

1380
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:07,725
I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry. We'll
make it another £5 for the letters.

1381
01:35:08,061 --> 01:35:12,225
'Olding out on me, were yer?
I knew I was being soft with yer.

1382
01:35:12,524 --> 01:35:15,971
Cold-blooded vindictiveness.
Read this one.

1383
01:35:18,071 --> 01:35:20,551
Unbelievable.

1384

We'd better have the full name of the man
to whom these were addressed, Miss...

1385

Miss, um...

1386
01:35:27,331 --> 01:35:29,140
Where is she?

1387
01:35:35,214 --> 01:35:40,778
On that train, I should think. Doesn't want
her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.

1388
01:35:43,388 --> 01:35:45,390
- Care for another, sir?
- Hm?

1389

God save the queen.

1397
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:32,013
Since the defence has called
but one witness, the prisoner,

1398
01:36:32,271 --> 01:36:34,592
it has the right to be heard last.

Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have
the final address for the prosecution.

1400
01:36:41,238 --> 01:36:45,448
My lord, members of the jury,
I will be brief in my final speech

1401
01:36:45,742 --> 01:36:50,270
because I think we've proved so obvious
a case of murder against Leonard Vole,

1402
01:36:50,581 --> 01:36:53,869
that a verdict of guilty must be
the only possible conclusion.

1403
01:36:54,626 --> 01:36:58,187
- I will briefly summarise these facts...
- <font color="#808080">(FOOTSTEPS)</font>

1404
01:37:04,094 --> 01:37:06,301
You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.

1405
01:37:06,972 --> 01:37:11,102
That is, if Sir Wilfrid is at all
interested in our proceedings.

1406
01:37:11,393 --> 01:37:15,682
I am, indeed, my lord. The speech for
the crown, however, is premature.

1407
01:37:15,981 --> 01:37:20,782
I ask that the case for the defence be
reopened. And that a witness be recalled.

1408
01:37:21,111 --> 01:37:24,832
I most strenuously object to the case
being reopened at this final stage.

1409
01:37:25,115 --> 01:37:28,244
Evidence of a startling nature
has come into my possession.

1410
01:37:28,493 --> 01:37:31,781
The course my learned friend
proposes is quite unprecedented.

1411
01:37:32,039 --> 01:37:35,680
I have anticipated this objection and
can meet it with ample precedent.

1412
01:37:35,959 --> 01:37:41,523
There is the king vs Stillman, reported
in the criminal appeal reports of 1926

1413
01:37:41,882 --> 01:37:44,203
at page 463.

1414
01:37:44,426 --> 01:37:48,511
Also, the king vs Porter in volume one
of the king's bench division reports,

1415
01:37:48,805 --> 01:37:52,093
1942 at page 153.

1416
01:37:52,351 --> 01:37:55,116
And lastly there is the case
of the king vs Sullivan

1417
01:37:55,354 --> 01:37:59,279
in which this issue was raised, which
I'm sure Your Lordship will remember,

1418
01:37:59,566 --> 01:38:02,046
since you appeared
for the prosecution.

1419
01:38:02,277 --> 01:38:06,805
I did? Oh, yes, before
Mr Justice Swindon.

1420
01:38:07,115 --> 01:38:09,277
What is this new
evidence, Sir Wilfrid?

1421
01:38:09,493 --> 01:38:11,495
Letters, my lord.

1422
01:38:11,703 --> 01:38:14,673
Letters written by Christine Helm.

1423
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:20,572
My lord, the prosecution
continues it's objection.

1424
01:38:20,837 --> 01:38:24,239
If my memory serves me well,
Your Lordship's similar objection

1425
01:38:24,508 --> 01:38:28,115
in the king against
Sullivan was sustained.

1426
01:38:30,138 --> 01:38:33,585
Your memory, for once,
serves you ill, Mr Myers.

1427
01:38:33,850 --> 01:38:38,219
My objection then was overruled
by Mr Justice Swindon.

1428
01:38:38,522 --> 01:38:41,571

Mrs Helm, you appreciate

Yes.

- Do you know a man named Max?
- I don't know what you mean.

1437
01:39:28,697 --> 01:39:32,543
It's a simple question. Do you or
do you not know a man called Max?

1438
01:39:32,826 --> 01:39:35,033
Max? Certainly not.

1439
01:39:35,245 --> 01:39:38,931
It's a fairly common name and yet
you've never known a man named Max?

1440
01:39:39,208 --> 01:39:41,609
In Germany, perhaps,
but a long time ago.

1441
01:39:41,835 --> 01:39:48,445
I shall not ask you to go back that far.
Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.

1442
01:39:50,344 --> 01:39:53,188
- What have you got there?
- A letter.

1443
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:55,671
I suggest that on October 20

1444
01:39:55,891 --> 01:39:59,100
- you wrote a letter...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1445
01:39:59,353 --> 01:40:02,721
- ...Addressed to a man named Max.
- I did nothing of the sort.

1446
01:40:02,981 --> 01:40:06,906
The letter was but one of a
series written to the same man.

1447
01:40:07,903 --> 01:40:09,951
Lies! All lies!

1448
01:40:10,155 --> 01:40:14,126
You seem to have been, well, let us
say, on intimate terms with this man.

1449
01:40:14,409 --> 01:40:17,060
How dare you say a thing like that?
It isn't true!

1450
01:40:17,287 --> 01:40:22,578
I'm not concerned with the general trend
of this correspondence, only one letter.

1451
01:40:22,918 --> 01:40:27,606
"My beloved Max, an extraordinary
thing has happened."

1452
01:40:27,923 --> 01:40:30,767
"I believe all our
difficulties may be ended."

1453
01:40:31,009 --> 01:40:33,489
I will not stand here and
listen to a pack of lies!

1454
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:37,406
That letter's a forgery.
It isn't even my letter paper!

1455
01:40:37,683 --> 01:40:39,890
- It isn't?
- No!

1456
01:40:40,102 --> 01:40:43,390
I write my letters on small blue
paper with my initials on it.

1457
01:40:47,609 --> 01:40:49,099
Like this?

call him and that's what he is.

1462
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:07,539
Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind
enough to identify your letter paper.

1463
01:41:07,838 --> 01:41:12,560
Now, if you like, I can have an
expert identify your handwriting.

1464
01:41:12,885 --> 01:41:14,694
Damn you!

1465
01:41:15,262 --> 01:41:18,152
- Damn you!
- Leave her alone!

1466
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:20,518
- Damn you!
- Mrs Helm!

1467
01:41:20,726 --> 01:41:24,094
Let me go! Let me get
out of here! Let me go!

1468
01:41:24,354 --> 01:41:25,719
- Mrs Helm!
- Let me go!

1469
01:41:25,898 --> 01:41:28,504

1471
01:41:34,907 --> 01:41:40,869
Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter
in question so that the jury may hear it?

1472
01:41:46,168 --> 01:41:51,254
"My beloved Max, an extraordinary
thing has happened."

1473
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:55,117
"All our difficulties
may soon be solved."

1474
01:41:55,385 --> 01:42:00,266
"Leonard is suspected of murdering
the old lady I told you about."

1475
01:42:00,599 --> 01:42:06,208
"His only hope of an alibi
depends on me and me alone."

1476
01:42:07,481 --> 01:42:13,488
"Suppose I testify that he was not at
home with me at the time of the murder,"

1477
01:42:13,862 --> 01:42:17,583
that he came home with
blood on his sleeves,

1478
01:42:17,866 --> 01:42:21,632
"and that he even admitted to
me that he'd killed her?"

1479
01:42:21,912 --> 01:42:25,234
"Strange that he always said he
would never let me leave him."

1480
01:42:25,499 --> 01:42:28,981
"But now, if this succeeds,
he will be leaving me"

1481
01:42:29,253 --> 01:42:32,974
because they will
take him away forever

1482
01:42:33,257 --> 01:42:37,819
"and I shall be free and
yours, my beloved."

1483
01:42:38,136 --> 01:42:42,778
"I count the hours until we
are together. Christine."

1484
01:42:46,019 --> 01:42:49,819
Mrs Helm? Will you go
back to the witness box?

1485
01:43:00,158 --> 01:43:05,198
I now ask you again, Christine
Helm, did you write this letter?

1486
01:43:05,539 --> 01:43:08,668
Christine, tell him you didn't
write it. I know you didn't.

1487
01:43:08,917 --> 01:43:12,888
Please answer my question.
Did you write this letter?

1488
01:43:13,171 --> 01:43:14,900
Before answering, Mrs Helm,

1489
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:20,256
I wish to warn you that the law regarding
perjury in this country is very severe.

1490
01:43:20,596 --> 01:43:24,043
If you have already committed
perjury in this courtroom,

1491
01:43:24,308 --> 01:43:27,790
I strongly advise you not
to add to your crime.

1492
01:43:28,061 --> 01:43:31,668
But, if this letter has
not been written by you,

1493
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:35,501
then now is the time
to state this fact.

1494
01:43:38,155 --> 01:43:40,237
I wrote the letter.

1495
01:43:40,449 --> 01:43:42,611
<font color="#808080">(MUTTERING)</font>

1496
01:43:42,826 --> 01:43:46,592
And that, my lord, is the
case for the defence.

1497
01:43:54,588 --> 01:43:57,876
I keep asking which is harder,
your head or your arteries?

1498
01:43:58,133 --> 01:44:00,215
Stop pressing your luck,
you're overdue.

1499
01:44:00,427 --> 01:44:04,398
We're all packed and ready. I hope
the jury won't take all afternoon.

1500
01:44:04,681 --> 01:44:05,842
I concede.

1501
01:44:06,016 --> 01:44:09,099
- Congratulations, here are your cigars.
- Not yet.

1502
01:44:09,353 --> 01:44:12,721
Come on, it's all over,
wrapped up neat and tidy.

1503
01:44:12,981 --> 01:44:16,269
- What's wrong?
- It's a little too neat, too tidy,

1504
01:44:16,527 --> 01:44:20,498
and altogether too symmetrical,
that's what's wrong with it.

1505
01:44:20,781 --> 01:44:23,910
- The jury is back.
- You're not worried about the verdict?

1506
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:28,164
It's not their judgment
that worries me, it's mine.

1507
01:44:28,539 --> 01:44:30,303
Come along.

1508
01:44:31,333 --> 01:44:33,301
Where's my Wig?

1509
01:45:02,322 --> 01:45:04,689
The prisoner will stand up.

1510
01:45:07,327 --> 01:45:12,094
Members of the jury, are you
all agreed upon your verdict?

1511
01:45:13,834 --> 01:45:15,040
We are.

1512
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:19,295
Do you find the prisoner at the
bar, Leonard Stephen Vole,

1513
01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:23,959
guilty or not guilty of the
murder of Emily Jane French?

1514
01:45:28,056 --> 01:45:29,421
Not guilty, m'lord.

1524

Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.
Thank you, Mr Mayhew.

1525

Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.

Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.
You were wonderful.

1527
01:46:49,304 --> 01:46:52,990
- I'd say we were lucky all around.
- Yeah.

1528
01:46:53,267 --> 01:46:56,953
I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,
Mr Vole, and we can release you.

1529
01:46:57,229 --> 01:47:00,233
"Mr Vole." They didn't call
me Mr when they charged me.

1530
01:47:00,482 --> 01:47:02,951
I'll go with you, I
have your hat and coat.

Let's go before they
change their mind!

he had one foot on the gallows

1533
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:20,548
and the other on a banana peel.

1534
01:47:20,752 --> 01:47:23,835
You ought to be very proud,
Wilfrid. Aren't you?

1535
01:47:24,089 --> 01:47:26,979
Not yet. We've disposed
of the gallows,

1536
01:47:27,217 --> 01:47:31,142
but there's still that banana peel
somewhere, under somebody's foot.

Ready, sir?
Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.

1542
01:48:02,377 --> 01:48:07,702
Let me finish the last of the cocoa while
I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.

1543
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:12,260
Would you excuse me,
Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.

1544
01:48:39,373 --> 01:48:43,298
I never thought you British could get
so emotional. Especially in public.

1545
01:48:43,585 --> 01:48:46,031
- I apologise for my compatriots.
- It's all right.

1546
01:48:46,255 --> 01:48:50,021
I don't mind being called names or pushed
around or even kicked in the shin.

1547
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:52,541
But I have a ladder in
my last pair of nylons.

1548
01:48:52,761 --> 01:48:56,891
In case you are not familiar with our
prison regulations, no silk stockings.

1549
01:48:57,182 --> 01:48:59,310
Prison? Will I go to prison?

1550
01:48:59,518 --> 01:49:03,000
You heard the judge. You will
certainly be charged with perjury,

1551
01:49:03,272 --> 01:49:07,436
- tried for it, and to prison you shall go.
- Well, it won't be for life, will it?

1552
01:49:07,734 --> 01:49:11,216
If I were appearing for the
prosecution, it would be.

1553
01:49:11,488 --> 01:49:15,334
You loathe me, don't you?
Like the people outside.

1554
01:49:15,617 --> 01:49:18,621
What a wicked woman I am,
and how brilliantly you exposed me

1555
01:49:18,871 --> 01:49:23,399
and saved Leonard's life. The great
Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.

1556
01:49:23,709 --> 01:49:29,239
Well, let me tell you something.
You didn't do it alone. You had help.

1557
01:49:30,549 --> 01:49:32,199
What are you driving at?

1558
01:49:32,384 --> 01:49:35,228
I'm not driving at anything.
Leonard is free and we did it.

1559
01:49:35,470 --> 01:49:36,835
- We?
- Remember?

1560
01:49:37,014 --> 01:49:40,541
When you said that no jury would believe
an alibi given by a loving wife,

1561
01:49:40,809 --> 01:49:44,734
no matter how much she swore he was
innocent? That gave me the idea.

1562
01:49:45,022 --> 01:49:46,547
What idea?

1563
01:49:46,732 --> 01:49:51,056
The idea that I should be a witness, not
for my husband, but for the prosecution.

1564
01:49:51,361 --> 01:49:55,161
That I should swear Leonard was guilty
and that you should expose me as a liar

1565
01:49:55,449 --> 01:49:59,534
because only then would they
believe Leonard was innocent.

1566
01:49:59,828 --> 01:50:03,389
So now you know the whole
story, Sir Wilfrid.

1567
01:50:08,837 --> 01:50:12,887
I'll give yer something
to dream about, mister.

1568
01:50:13,175 --> 01:50:15,746
Want to kiss me, ducky?

1569
01:50:19,598 --> 01:50:23,523
I suspected something,
but not that.

1570
01:50:23,810 --> 01:50:26,700
- Never that!
- Thank you for the compliment.

1571
01:50:26,939 --> 01:50:30,546
It's been a long time since I acted
and I never played such a vital role.

1572
01:50:30,817 --> 01:50:33,582
All those blue letters!

1573
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:37,302
It took me hours to write them,
to invent Max. There never was a Max.

1574
01:50:37,574 --> 01:50:39,941
There's never been
anyone but Leonard.

1575
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,322
My dear, could you
not have trusted me,

1576
01:50:42,538 --> 01:50:46,338
worked with me truthfully and
honourably? We would have won.

1577
01:50:46,625 --> 01:50:49,435
I could not run that risk.
You thought he was innocent.

1578
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:52,719
And you knew he was innocent.
I understand.

1579
01:50:52,965 --> 01:50:56,128
No, Sir Wilfrid, you do
not understand at all.

1580
01:50:56,385 --> 01:50:58,752
I knew he was guilty.

1581
01:51:02,266 --> 01:51:05,110
That can't be true! No!

1582
01:51:06,436 --> 01:51:08,757
Listen to me, once and for all.

1583
01:51:08,981 --> 01:51:11,587
He came home after ten,
he had blood on his sleeves,

1584
01:51:11,817 --> 01:51:15,139
he said he had killed the woman,
only I could save him. He pleaded.

1585
01:51:15,404 --> 01:51:18,408
And you saved him? A murderer?

1586
01:51:18,657 --> 01:51:20,705
Again, you don't understand.

1587
01:51:20,909 --> 01:51:22,877
I love him.

1588
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:31,037
I told you she was an actress.
And a good one.

1589
01:51:31,253 --> 01:51:32,823
Leonard!

1590
01:51:33,005 --> 01:51:36,054
I knew she'd do something,
but I just didn't know what or how.

1591
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,268
Leonard, Leonard.

1592
01:51:40,387 --> 01:51:45,678
- Fooled you completely, didn't she?
- It was you, Vole, who fooled me.

1593
01:51:46,018 --> 01:51:51,468
Oh, easy. Easy. We both got out of
this alive, let's stay this way.

1594
01:51:51,815 --> 01:51:55,183
- Where are your pills?
- You've made a mockery of English law.

1595
01:51:55,444 --> 01:51:58,573
Who did? You got me off and
I can't be tried again for this.

1596
01:51:58,822 --> 01:52:03,225
- That's English law too, isn't it?
- You can't touch him now. Nobody can.

1597
01:52:03,535 --> 01:52:06,141
The scales of justice may
tip one way or another,

1598
01:52:06,371 --> 01:52:09,375
but ultimately they balance out.
You'll pay for this.

1599
01:52:09,625 --> 01:52:13,630
Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather pay
for it as soon as possible and in cash.

1600
01:52:13,921 --> 01:52:18,290
Suppose we double your fee? There'll be
lots of money once the will goes through.

1601
01:52:18,592 --> 01:52:21,436
I'm not cheap, I want everybody
to get something out of it.

1602
01:52:21,678 --> 01:52:25,125
There's Janet McKenzie.
We'll get her that new hearing aid.

1603
01:52:25,390 --> 01:52:30,191
And we'll get you a new one of these.
18-carat gold if they make them.

1604
01:52:30,521 --> 01:52:34,082
And when they try you for perjury
there'll be £5,000 for the defence.

1605
01:52:34,358 --> 01:52:38,920
I don't care, just so we'll be together.
You don't know what I've been through.

1606
01:52:39,238 --> 01:52:44,005
Standing in the witness box, having to
face you, saying I never loved you.

1607
01:52:44,326 --> 01:52:45,487
What is it, Leonard?

1608
01:52:45,661 --> 01:52:49,382
The luggage is in the car and we've only
20 minutes to catch the boat train.

1609
01:52:49,665 --> 01:52:52,145
This is a nice young lady
I met during the trial.

1610
01:52:52,376 --> 01:52:53,662
Len!

1611
01:52:53,835 --> 01:52:55,439
Oh, Len!

1612
01:52:55,629 --> 01:52:57,199
Len...

1613
01:52:58,882 --> 01:53:02,443
Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep
me away. It's had me nearly crazy.

1614
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:05,120
Leonard, who's this girl?

1615
01:53:05,347 --> 01:53:07,953
I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.

1616
01:53:08,183 --> 01:53:09,947
Tell her, Len.

1617
01:53:10,143 --> 01:53:13,511
Leonard, is this the girl who was
with you in the travel bureau?

1618
01:53:13,772 --> 01:53:16,821
The girl you said you hardly knew,
didn't even know her name?

1619
01:53:17,067 --> 01:53:21,550
That's right. That's who I am and I know
all about you. You're not his wife.

1620
01:53:21,864 --> 01:53:25,994
Never have been. You're years older than
he is. We've been together for months

1621
01:53:26,285 --> 01:53:31,974
and we're going away on a cruise, just
like they said in court. Tell her, Len.

1622
01:53:32,332 --> 01:53:37,133
- Yes, Len, tell me yourself.
- All right, Diana, come along.

1623
01:53:37,462 --> 01:53:40,068
You can't, not after what
I've done. I won't let you.

1624
01:53:40,299 --> 01:53:43,143
I saved your life getting
you out of Germany,

1625
01:53:43,385 --> 01:53:46,468
you got me out of this mess,
so we're even. It's over now.

1626
01:53:46,722 --> 01:53:51,091
Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!
Don't, Leonard! Don't!

1627
01:53:51,393 --> 01:53:54,158
Full yourself together. They'll
have you up for perjury.

1628
01:53:54,396 --> 01:53:58,799
Don't make it worse or they'll
try you as an accessory.

1629
01:53:59,109 --> 01:54:01,316
And you know what that means.

1630
01:54:01,528 --> 01:54:06,011
I don't care. Let them. Let them try me
for perjury, or an accessory, or...

1631
01:54:07,201 --> 01:54:09,772
- Ready?
- Or better yet...

1632
01:54:09,995 --> 01:54:11,918
let them try me for...!

1633
01:54:12,122 --> 01:54:13,886
Argh!

1634
01:54:17,252 --> 01:54:19,016
<font color="#808080">(DIANA SCREAMS)</font>

1635
01:54:20,797 --> 01:54:22,561
<font color="#808080">(GOBS)</font>

1636
01:54:35,521 --> 01:54:39,890
- Call a doctor.
- It's no use. No doctor can help now.

1637
01:54:41,109 --> 01:54:43,430
- What happened?
- She killed him.

1638
01:54:43,654 --> 01:54:45,577
Killed him?

1639
01:54:45,781 --> 01:54:47,943
She executed him.

1640
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:52,140
Carter, what have you
done with the luggage?

1641
01:54:52,371 --> 01:54:57,855
I sent it on ahead to the station,
and I've got a cab waiting outside.

1642
01:55:04,633 --> 01:55:08,433
- A remarkable woman.
- You can just barely catch the boat train.

1643
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:12,361
Better bring the luggage back,
and you can dismiss the cab.

1644
01:55:12,641 --> 01:55:15,611
We are not going yet, are we?

1645
01:55:18,146 --> 01:55:20,911
Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.

1646
01:55:21,149 --> 01:55:23,720
Get Brogan-Moore to my
chambers, and Mayhew too.

1647
01:55:23,944 --> 01:55:28,074
We're appearing for the defence
in the trial of Christine Vole.

1648
01:55:28,365 --> 01:55:30,129
Sir Wilfrid?

1649
01:55:30,325 --> 01:55:32,896
You've forgotten your brandy.

1650
01:55:55,684 --> 01:55:57,527
The management of
this theatre suggests

1651
01:55:57,728 --> 01:56:01,813
that for the greater entertainment of
friends who have not yet seen the picture,

1652
01:56:02,107 --> 01:56:05,156
you will not divulge to anyone
the secret of the ending

1653
01:56:05,402 --> 01:56:08,053
of "Witness For The Prosecution".
