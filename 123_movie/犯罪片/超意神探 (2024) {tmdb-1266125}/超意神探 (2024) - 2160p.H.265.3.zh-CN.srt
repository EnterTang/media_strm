那都是因为他们很喜欢我

143
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:18,311
They just don't want to admit it.
他们只是不愿承认而已

144
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:19,812
Yeah. No.

145
00:09:19,814 --> 00:09:21,948
I don't like you. 
我不喜欢你

146
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,584
You'll have the case files by the end of the day.

147
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:26,536
Listen, there's this poker game we got going on.
嘿 我们要打扑克牌

148
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:28,321
It's a friendly game, mostly law enforcement, 
友谊赛 大部分都是法院的人

149
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:29,506
State Department, FBI.

150
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:30,623
You want in?

I'll call you with the details.

155
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:40,934
You boys leave tonight. Don't come back.

I don't want to see you again. Understood?

157
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:59,319
Well, that was a complete waste of time.
哎 这完全就是浪费时间

158
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:02,338
Not one security camera near SAC Federal caught the robbery.
萨克拉门托联邦银行附近没有一个监控捕捉到劫案的画面

159
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,689
Thanks.
谢了

160
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:05,458
Sure. What's all this?
不客气 这都是什么?

161
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,660
Case files and footage from the other robberies.
案件资料和其他几起劫案拍到的画面

162
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:08,995
Check this out.
看看这个

163
00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:11,464
The SAC Fed job was by far the largest haul...
萨克拉门托联邦银行是目前最大的目标...

164
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:13,500
more than double any of the other robberies.
现金额度是其他劫案的两倍多

165
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:15,151
- They're getting ambitious.  - Not they.
- 这些人开始野心勃勃了  - 不是这些人

166
00:10:15,153 --> 00:10:17,387
He. Now in each one of the robberies, there's maybe
只是一个人 在每个劫案里 摄像头被涂黑之前

167
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,839
30 seconds of footage before the cameras were blacked out.
总有30秒左右的图像

168
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:21,508
That was enough to analyze
这就足够拿来分析

169
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,993
the suspects' height, weight, build, and skin color, so I did.
疑犯的身高 体重 体形和肤色 我试了一下

170
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:25,395
And guess what.
猜猜怎么着

171
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:28,932
Only one of the robbers was involved in all four crimes.
4次劫案里只有一个劫匪是吻合的

172
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:30,883
That's him.
就是他

173
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:33,319
So the other robbers... they were work for hire?
这么说来其他的劫匪... 都是临时雇来的?

174
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:34,821
Exactly. They do one job and then they disappear.
正是如此 他们做完一次就消失

175
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:35,855
But if we can find this guy, 
但如果我们能找到这个主谋

176
00:10:35,857 --> 00:10:38,141
we find them all. He's the key.
就能一网打尽了 他就是关键

177
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:40,210
Do you remember anything about the men who did this?
你记得劫匪的样子吗?

178
00:10:40,212 --> 00:10:41,611
No. Not a thing.
不 一点都不记得

179
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:43,930
You know Ernie and I were up for the same promotion?
你们应该知道我和Ernie当时都在争取同一个升职机会?

180
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:46,032
I was mad when I didn't get it.
当我失败的时候 我快疯了

181
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:48,001
But not now.
但现在我不这么想了

182
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:49,619
That could've been me in there.
不然那里面死的人就是我了

183
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:53,006
Ernie was a good man.
Ernie是个好人

184
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:55,375
He didn't deserve this.
他不该这么英年早逝

185
00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:57,377
What were you doing during the robbery?
劫案发生时你在做什么?

186
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,128
What they told me to.
照他们要求趴着

187
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,298
I am not trying to get shot over this job.
我可不想为了这份工作就把命丢了

188
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,051
Ernie must've done something wrong. Poor fool.
Ernie肯定做错了什么事 真是可怜的傻瓜

189
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:07,420
And that's when the robbers ordered you to the ground?
就是劫匪命令你们趴在地上的时候?

190
00:11:07,422 --> 00:11:09,856
Yeah. He stuck a gun right in my face.
是的 他拿着把枪直指着我的脸

191
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:13,259
I was gonna grab it and take those guys down, 
我本想拔枪 然后放倒他们

192
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:14,760
but I just had back surgery, 
可惜我背上刚好有伤

193
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:18,948
so I didn't want to risk the loss of innocent lives.
所以我不能冒险伤害到无辜的生命

194
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,533
After that, one of the robbers
之后 其中一个劫匪

195
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:24,270
took assistant manager Ernie Wright into the vault.
就把副经理Ernie Wright带到了金库里面

196
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:27,073
I think so. I don't really know. I was in the back.
应该是的 我不太清楚 我当时在后面

197
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:28,374
During the robbery?

In the men's room.
我当时在厕所里

199
00:11:29,494 --> 00:11:31,227
Is this really necessary?

200
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:32,155
I've already been through...

You were in the men's room the whole time?

202
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:35,114
Yes.
是

203
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:39,135
I was, uh, washing up when I heard the gunshot.
我当时正在洗脸 突然听见一声枪响

204
00:11:39,137 --> 00:11:41,988

当然 我一开始不知道是枪声

205
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,473
It wasn't until I stepped into the hall
直到我走到大厅 听到一声尖叫

206
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:45,325
that I heard the screaming.
我才意识到的

207
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:46,859
Was anyone back there with you?

208
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:48,194
Not that I saw.

Ernie and I had lunch plans.

when I went into the back to use the restroom.

212
00:11:55,537 --> 00:11:58,771
Yes, we saw as much on the security footage.

214
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:03,927
heading into the men's room just behind you.
在你后面进了男厕所

215
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,228
Do you remember seeing him?
你看到过他吗?

216
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,979

00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:09,782
Not until after I heard the shot.
我听见枪声以后看到了 

218
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:13,419
I opened the door, and Armin was standing there.
听见枪声我打开门 看到Armin就站在那

219
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:16,122
Then I heard the robbers shouting, so I closed the door, 
然后我听见劫匪在喊叫 所以我把门给关上了

220
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:19,442
and I... I hid in the stall until they left.
然后... 然后我就躲在里面直到他们跑了

221
00:12:19,444 --> 00:12:22,328
Mr.Gagnon was in the hallway?
Gagnon先生站在走廊里?

222
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,429
Here?

00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:28,418
Just trying to get the facts straight, ma'am.
只是想弄清到底发生什么了

226
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,304
Was Ernie the type to fight back?

No.
不是

00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:36,309
Ernie was a big Teddy bear.
Ernie就像大一点的泰迪熊

229
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:40,396
He'd never fight unless it was to protect someone he loved.
我想 他要不是为了保护所爱的人 一定不会去和劫匪争斗的

230
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,203
Hey. How's it going?

233
00:12:50,024 --> 00:12:51,357
This ringleader...

234
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,992
he had to have planned the robberies, right?
他是计划所有抢劫案的人 对吧?

235
00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:54,193
Right.
没错

236
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:56,362
Which means he probably visited each of the banks
这就意味着他可能在抢劫之前

237
00:12:56,364 --> 00:12:57,697
before he robbed them.
就去过银行调查过

238
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,699
On camera and without a mask, yeah.
可能会被摄像头拍下来

239
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:01,668
So we run all the security footage
所以我们把这几家银行的

240
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,536
through facial recognition software, and when we find
保安录像做一遍脸部比对 可能会找到

241
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:06,005
the man that visited all four banks before the robberies, 
在四家银行被抢劫前都出现过的人

242
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:07,206
we find our ringleader.
那人就是主谋了

243
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,725
Great idea.
绝妙的方法

244
00:13:08,727 --> 00:13:11,811
It's an idea. I don't know if I'd call it great.
是个方法 但是不能说很绝妙

245
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:14,731
Ah, he's just jealous.
别理他 他嫉妒而已

246
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:15,999
What are you wearing?

247
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:18,151
Oh, these things?
这双鞋吗?

00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:20,720

只是替代品

249
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:22,054
How about this?
这样如何?

250
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:24,223
Whoever figures out the bank robber's name first

251
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:25,675
wins lunch for a week.
谁就请客吃一个星期午饭

252
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:28,895
Yeah, that usually doesn't end well for us.
每次一打赌 结局可能就不会很好

253
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:31,247
What do you say, Grace? You feeling lucky?
你接受吗 Grace? 觉得会赢吗?

254
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:33,899
You're on.
没问题

255
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:39,605
萨克拉门托联邦银行

255
00:13:39,606 --> 00:13:41,207
It was closed.

Must've been closed.

The safe deposit vault is always closed.

259
00:13:48,782 --> 00:13:51,601
I think it was closed.

260
00:13:51,603 --> 00:13:53,102

是

261
00:13:53,104 --> 00:13:55,021
I want you to close your eyes.
我想让你闭上眼睛

262
00:13:56,473 --> 00:13:58,591
Hey, we're grown-ups. Come on.

263
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:03,379
Now put your mental self back in this very spot, 
现在 将自我意识聚焦在这里

264
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:06,783
in that very moment.
在那个时候

265
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:09,402
I want you to hear the sound that your shoes made
我想让你回忆起来你走过这里时 

266
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:11,571
on this marble floor.

267
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:13,990
Now without opening your eyes, 
别睁开眼睛

268
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:17,944
I want you to picture the door as you pass by.

Can you see the door?
看见门了吗?

看见了

272
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:23,783
And?

273
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:26,135
It was open.
是开着的

274
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:27,887
A-ha.
没错

275
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:30,890
Which means someone
这就意味着

276
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:34,577
went inside the safe deposit vault during the robbery.
有人在抢劫过程中进过这个保险库

278
00:14:36,097 --> 00:14:38,181
trying to take something from a deposit box.

Oh, my. What if they did?

Let's find out, shall we?

That's impossible.
这不太可能

282
00:14:42,637 --> 00:14:43,653
It is?

The safe deposit boxes are legal property

of the individuals who rent them.

Only the owners do.

Oh, good morning to you, too.

Oh, I'm not gonna fall

306
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:29,682
for that old trick, Grace.

Write it down on a piece of paper

within weeks of you visiting.

Which is conclusive evidence of what?

I think it's evidence that your client

342
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:14,220
planned to commit armed robbery.
参与持枪抢劫的证据

And you've been smart so far.

Blacking out security cameras, going straight for the vault.

但这次你搞砸了 有人死了

351
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:39,612
Maybe the SAC Fed job was too big for you.
也许萨克拉门托联邦银行的这次抢劫太大了

352
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:43,115
O... or maybe the murder was a part of the plan all along.
或者... 也许谋杀本来就是计划里的一环

I didn't rob Sacramento Federal.
我没有抢劫萨克拉门托联邦银行

I didn't rob any bank.

355
00:18:48,373 --> 00:18:50,923
But if I did, I certainly wouldn't need to kill someone.
但如果我要抢 肯定就不会杀人

356
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:53,075
That's just sloppy.
这太草率了

357
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:58,197
Now I've had my brushes with the law, 
法律的确让我吃过亏

358
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,132
but I've learned some things from them, 
但我也学到了东西

359
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:04,653
like the fact that you can't use my past against me in court
比如说 在法庭上 你不能用我的过去来当证据

360
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:09,725
and no matter what you say inside this little room, 
还有 你在这个小房间里无论讲了什么

361
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:12,194
you have nothing on me.
都是没证据的

362
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:15,097
So unless there's something else, Agent Lisbon,

363
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:17,366
I think I should be getting back to work.

呃 我就提一句 提醒一下你

370
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:40,222
that large mirror is, in fact, a window.
那面大镜子 其实是个窗户

371
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:42,675
What do you want?

Uh, I can see that you're a professional,

373
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:46,328
but, uh, Agent Lisbon was correct. Uh, 
但Lisbon探员说得没错

374
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,848
this last robbery was a break in pattern.
最近这起抢劫和以往的不同

375
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,650
Uh, I don't mean that just because someone was killed.

I'm talking about the entire job.

377
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,513
How's that?
怎么不同了?

378
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:57,538
Well, the other three robberies were simple...

small town banks, very little security,

380
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,478
straightforward.
一击必中

381
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,247
But SAC Federal... bigger.
但萨克拉门托联邦银行... 比较大

382
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:06,465
Much bigger.

Mr. Jane, we've already answered...
Jane先生 我们已经回答了...

384
00:20:08,035 --> 00:20:09,418
Now there had to be something

385
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,604
that gave you that extra bit of confidence

I should've known.

拜托 你工资买得起这个包? 它彻底出卖了你

442

And you bite your nails. Sure sign of anxiety.

Yet someone as anxious as you

to pull off a crime like this.

What'd you say to me?

- Hello?  - Hey, boss.

We checked out the Arroyo brothers' apartment.

Place is empty.
人去楼空了

483
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:12,894
According to the building manager,

they took off late last night.

they were headed to Mexico to visit family.

It was torched pretty bad.

492
00:24:26,627 --> 00:24:27,710
All right.
好吧

493
00:24:27,712 --> 00:24:28,961
Flag the Arroyo brothers with customs.

If they're on their way to Mexico,

maybe we can get them before they cross the border.

496

499
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:45,320
You will never believe who was working with the bank robbers.

500
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:47,456
Ernie Wright.
就是Ernie Wright

501
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:52,928
Probably shouldn't discuss it here.

We're very sorry for your loss.

There's no way Ernie could do something like this.

There's just no way.

太荒谬了

508
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:21,438
Ernie?
你说Ernie?

509
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,840
Robbing a bank? I mean, he wasn't the type.

He was exactly the type.

Judging from these photographs here,

I'd say Ernie became a different man.

started dressing sharper.
穿着也注意了很多

515
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:38,472
Powerful external transformations

516
00:26:38,474 --> 00:26:41,958
can often coincide with even larger internal ones.

517

He was trying to better himself.

518
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:45,445
Why? Because of you?

519
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:48,215
I encouraged him, of course.

I saw that he was sweet

that could be traced back to him,

but, uh, I got it all backwards.

They didn't take anything.
