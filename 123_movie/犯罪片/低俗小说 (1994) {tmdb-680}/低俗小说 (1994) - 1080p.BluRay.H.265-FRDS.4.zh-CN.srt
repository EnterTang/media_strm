147
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,140
我们真该带带猎枪来处理这种事情
We should have shot guns for this kind of deal

148
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,610
上面有多少人？
How many up there?

149
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,180
三、四个吧
Three or four

150
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,240
包括我们的人?
That's counting our guy?

151
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,900
不确定
I'm not sure

152
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,570
所以有可能五个人
So that means it could be up to five guys up there?

153
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,110
很有可能
It's possible

154
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,710
真他妈该拿猎枪来的！
We should have fucking shotguns

155
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,750
她叫什么?
What's her name?

156
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,720
米娅        米娅?
Mia  Mia?

157
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,690
马瑟勒斯怎么认识她的
How did Marsellus and her meet?

158
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,880
谁知道呢 就这么认识的
I don't know  However people meet people

159
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,520
她当过演员
She used to be an actress

160
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,960
是吗?她演过什么?
Oh, really? She do anything I'd have seen?

161
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,790
我想她最重要的演出就是一个样片儿吧
I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot

162
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,520
“样片”是什么玩意?
Pilot? What's a pilot?

163
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,530
呃…看过电视剧吧?
Well, you know the shows on TV?

164
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,100
我从不看电视的
I don't watch TV

165
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,000
那你知道有一种发明叫电视机…
Yeah, but you are aware that there's an invention called television

166
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,000
电视机上面要演电视节目吧？
and on this invention they show shows, right?

167
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,100
知道
Yeah

168
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,540
他们选择电视剧的方式就是先拍一集 这第一集就叫"样片"
The way they pick TV shows, they make one show  That show's called a pilot

169
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,910
拍好就给选片的人看
Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows

170
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,110
根据样片决定哪个可以继续拍下去
and on the strength of that one show they decide if they want to make more shows

171
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,810
被选中的就成为电视节目
Some get chosen and become television programs

172
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,750
没被选上就什么也不是
Some don't, become nothing

173
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,550
她演的就什么也不是
She starred in one of the ones that became nothing

174
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,500
你记得那个安特万・罗卡莫拉吗？
You remember Antwan Rockamora?

175
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,730
黑人和萨摩亚人混血的绰号叫“恐怖东尼”的那个
Half-black, half-Samoan used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror".

176
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,730
呃…那个胖子吗?
Yeah, maybe  Fat, right?

177
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,830
我才不会叫这哥们儿胖子呢 他确实有点超重
I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat  I mean, he got a weight problem

178
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,490
可这黑鬼能做什么？他是个萨摩亚裔！
（萨摩亚裔通常都超肥的）
What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan

179
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,540
我知道你说的是谁了他怎么了？
Yeah, I think I know who you mean  What about him?

180
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,830
马瑟勒斯把他修理惨了
Well, Marsellus fucked him up good

181
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,000
据说是因为马瑟勒斯・华莱士的老婆
Word around the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife

182
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,280
他做了什么？操她了？      不不不 没这么糟
So, what'd he do, fuck her? No, no, no, no, no  Nothing that bad

183
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,020
那是怎么一回事?
Well, then, what, then?

184
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,520
替她做了脚部按摩
Gave her a foot massage

185
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,620
脚部按摩？
A foot massage?

186
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,730
仅此而已?
That's it?

187
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,820
马瑟勒斯怎么整的他?
Then what did Marsellus do?

188
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,660
派了几个手下去他的住处把他弄到公寓楼的露台上
Sent a couple of cats over to his place They took him out on his patio,

189
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,770
然后拖上阳台 黑鬼从四楼摔了下来
threw his ass over the balcony  Nigger fell four stories

190
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,040
楼下有个玻璃顶棚的小花园 像一个温室
They had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse

191
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,540
那黑鬼就摔里面去了
Nigger fell through that

192
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,840
从那以后 他就变得口吃了
Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment

193
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,280
太丢脸了！
That's a damn shame

223
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,610
几点了
What time you got?

224
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,820
七点二十二分
7:22 in the a m

225
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,590
还早 来 我们走走
No, it ain't quite time yet  Come on  Let's hang back

226
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,140
我不给男人做脚部按摩不代表马瑟勒斯是对的 
Just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus

227
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,640
把安特万从楼上仍进该死的玻璃花房摔成结巴太他妈过份了
to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfucking house fucking up the way the nigger talks

228
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,180
谁他妈要敢这样对我 他最好快来添我的屁股
That shit ain't right Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass

229
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,180
因为我绝对要杀了那狗杂种报仇懂吗？
cause I'd kill the motherfucker you know what I'm saying?

230
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,800
我没说他是对的 
I ain't saying it's right

231
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,010
但是你说脚部按摩根本没什么 这我不同意
But you're saying a foot massage don't mean nothing and I'm saying it does

232
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:10,680
我替很多女人做过脚部按摩 都“有什么”！
I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant something

233
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,590
大家都心照不宣 所以才他妈很爽！
Now, we act like they don't, but they do  That's what's so fucking cool about 'em

234
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,460
大家都能感觉到 但不会说破
There's a sensuous thing going on where, you know you don't talk about it

235
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,120
男女各自心知肚明
but you know it, and she knows it

236
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,890
马瑟勒斯很清楚 安特万更他妈清楚
Fucking Marsellus knew it and Antwan should've fucking better known better

237
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,660
伙计 那可是他老婆！可不能拿这事儿开玩笑！
I mean, that's his fucking wife, man  This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit

238
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,640
懂我的意思了吗?
You know what I'm saying?

239
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,680
很有意思…走吧 该干活了
It's an interesting point  Come on  Let's get into character

240
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,480
她叫什么来着?
What's her name again?

241
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,850
米娅  米娅
Mia  Mia

242
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,710
干嘛对老大的女人感兴趣?
Why you so interested in big man's wife?

243
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,850
老大要去趟弗罗里达 叫我搞定她
Well, he's going out of town, Florida and he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone

244
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,080
搞定她?      别想歪 老兄
Take care of her? No, man  Just take her out

245
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,220
我只是负责陪她寻乐子 不让她无聊而已
You know, show her a good time  Make sure she don't get lonely

246
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,860
你要带米娅・华莱士出去约会?
You're gonna be taking Mia Wallace out on a date?

247
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,660
不是约会
It is not a date

248
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,900
就像陪好友老婆出去玩玩
It's just like if you were going to take your buddy's wife to a movie or something

249
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,470
大家开开心罢了
It's just good company, that's all

250
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,510
这不算约会 绝对不算
It's not a date  It's definitely not a date

251
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,450
小崽子们 你们好吗?
Hey, kids  How you boys doing?

252
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,620
嘿…放轻松点
Hey, keep chilling

253
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,460
知道我们是谁吗?
You know who we are?

254
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:49,490
我们是你们的合伙人马塞勒斯・华莱士的朋友
We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace

255
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,970
你们一定记得你们的合伙人 对吗?
You do remember your business partner, don't you?

256
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,140
让我来猜猜看
Let me take a wild guess here

257
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,110
你是布莱特?
You're Brett, right?

258
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,510
是的  我就知道
Yeah  I thought so

259
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,880
记得你合伙人马瑟勒斯・华莱士吗？布莱特?
You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace don't you, Brett?

260
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,920
嗯…记…记得
Yeah, I remember him

261
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,500

262
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,200

Sorry about that

263
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,780

营养丰富的早餐哦！
The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast

266
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,730
哪种汉堡?
What kind of hamburgers?

267
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,770
吉…吉士汉堡…
Ch-ch-cheeseburgers

268
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,860

No, no, no, no  Where'd you get 'em? McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box, where?

269
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,670
大魔法师汉堡
Um, Big Kahuna Burger

270
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,800
大魔法师汉堡！那家夏威夷汉堡店
Big Kahuna Burger  That's that Hawaiian burger joint

271
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:44,110
我没试过 听说很棒 好吃吗?
I hear they got some tasty burgers  I ain't never had one myself  How are they?

272
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,110
好吃      介意我尝尝你的吗?
They're good  You mind if I try one of yours?

273
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,580
这是你的吧?  是的…

274
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,620
嗯！这汉堡真棒！
Mmm! This is a tasty burger

275
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,670
文森 你吃过大魔法师汉堡吗?
Vincent, you ever had a Big Kahuna Burger?

276
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,070
尝一口 好吃极了
Want a bite? They're real tasty

277
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,430
我不饿
I ain't hungry

278
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,500
喜欢吃汉堡的人 一定得尝尝这个
If you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime

279
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,200
我…
Me,

280
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,200
我不能经常吃因为我马子是素食主义者
I can't usually get 'em ' cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian

281
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,600
她很想把我也变成素食主义者
which pretty much makes me a vegetarian

282
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,110
不过这汉堡真的很赞!
But I do love the taste of a good burger

283
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,540

知道为什么吗?
You know why they call it that?

288
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,660
因为他们用的是公制?
Because of the metric system?

289
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,000
你真是天才布莱特！
Check out the big brain on Brett!

290
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,760
你真他妈的聪明 公制 一点也不错
You're a smart motherfucker  That's right  The metric system

291
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,430
这是什么?
What's in this?

You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?

294
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,670
请便
Go right ahead

296
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,020
你 睡美人 知道我们为什么来吗？
You, Flock of Seagulls  You know why we're here?

297
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,030
最好告诉我兄弟文森特你们把那东西藏哪儿了?
Why don't you tell my man Vince here where you got the shit hid at?

298
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,690
在那里…     我他妈问你了吗？
It's over there  I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing!

299
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,730
