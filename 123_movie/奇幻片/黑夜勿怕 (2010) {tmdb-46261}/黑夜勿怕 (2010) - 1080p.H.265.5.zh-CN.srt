1
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,980
Mr. Blackwood?

2
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,110
Sir?

3
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,060
Mr. Blackwood, I'm sorry. You did ring, sir?

4
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,730
Come down.

5
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm so...

6
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,240
So very sorry.

7
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,210
I didn't see the steps.

8
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,620
They made me do it.

9
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,910
I didn't...

10
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,470
If I want to see my child again,

11
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,920
I must comply.

12
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,130
Mr. Blackwood.

13
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,590
Please understand.

14
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,460
Precious teeth. Beautiful teeth.

15
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,090
Ransom for my boy.

16
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,510
Yes.

17
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,560
Daddy.

18
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,670
I brought you something more to eat.

19
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,220
Not children's teeth like you wanted,

20
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,440
but please accept them

21
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,310
in exchange for him.

22
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,140
Children's teeth.

23
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,160
Oh, no, that's the best I could do.

24
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,490
And they're my own. You see?

25
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,410
My own.

26
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,740
Please. Give me back my son!

27
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,250
Yes, your son is down here. Reach for him.

28
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,880
Son? Son!

29
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,540
Son!

30
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,590
Grab my hand!

31
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,330
<i>We've now begun our descent into T.F. Green Airport.</i>

32
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,540
<i>Please return to your seat, make sure it is in...</i>

33
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,390
She's landed.

34
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,760
What do you think? Too much?

35
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,560
No, it's perfect. Just like you.

36
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,680
There's my girl.

37
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,810
Sally?

38
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,780
Wow! Look how tall you are!

39
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,780
What are you, 17 now?

40
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,830
Dad, you know how old I am.

41
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,280
I know. I'm being silly.

42
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,910
- Hey.  - Good morning, sir.

43
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,120
Thank you.

44
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,330
Come on.

45
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,410
Sally, this is Kim. Kim, Sally.

46
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,000
Hi, Sally. It's nice to meet you.

47
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,170
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

48
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,750
Thanks.

49
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,010
What about a picture? You got your camera?

50
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,560
It's good to see you.

51
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,270
<i>Good morning, Rhode Island!</i>

52
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,280
- Everything okay?  - Yeah.

53
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,570
<i>We've got fog this morning and a slight chance of a shower later on.</i>

54
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,980
Smell that fresh air, kiddo?

55
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,950
Sure beats the smog of LA, huh?

56
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,380
I have to call Mom now.

57
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,960
Just press one and the green.

58
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,600
<i>Hi, you've called Joanne and the magical Sally! Leave us a message.</i>

59
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,340
L.C. delivered the flooring. If it rains, I'm afraid it's going to warp.

60
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,430
Well, just put it in the garage.

61
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,720
Sally, say hello to Mr. Harris.

62
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,850
Nice to meet you.

63
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,690
Come take a look at the house.

64
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,660
Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris, would you give me a hand...

65
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,960
- How's it going?  - Good.

66
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,460
- When do you think you'll be finished?  - No problem.

67
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,030
Good, huh?

68
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,920
- It smells funny.  - You should have smelled it before.

69
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,960
They had moldy newspapers everywhere,

70
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,010
and dead pigeons all over the floor and poop.

71
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,210
- Lots of it.  - It's Jacoby's office.

72
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,590
Mr. Jacoby.

73
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,550
Oh, hey, Michelle. Sorry.

74
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,390
I don't know. Hold on. I'll check.

75
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,270
You got the photographs?

76
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,080
I like to draw, too.

77
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,420
You work here?

78
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,210
No, Sally, I live here.

79
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,090
I'm the interior designer. Do you know what that is?

80
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,100
Of course you do.

81
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,890
You see all the animal paintings and friezes?

82
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,150
They're by Emerson Blackwood, a man who once lived here.

83
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,240
He was a very famous wildlife painter.

84
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,940
Hey, Sally, look.

85
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,120
You want to try?

86
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,620
What do you have there?

87
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,950
- I found it.  - That's mine.

88
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,790
It was my grandmother's. When I was little, my mother gave it to me.

89
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,130
My mom gave me to my dad.

90
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,960
Sally?

91
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,180
You want to see your room?

92
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,200
What do you think?

93
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,830
Kim and I worked really hard to get it ready. Check this out.

94
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,550
It's pretty great, huh?

95
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,050
It looks better at night.

96
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,800
How long am I staying here?

97
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,770
What did your mother tell you?

98
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,030
She told me I was coming to visit. But then she packed all my clothes.

99
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,360
She didn't explain anything to you?

100
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,160
- No.  - Sally.

101
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,910
Your mother and I are worried about you.

102
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,990
She thinks that maybe you're feeling sad

103
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,080
and she thought that... Well, we thought that perhaps a change

104
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,960
might be good for you and that you could come and live here with Kim and me

105
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,630
until we finish the work on the house and sell it.

106
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,180
Then we could move somewhere else and...

107
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,510
Sally? Come on. Open the door.

108
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,690
Come on. Let me in.

109
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,520
Are you going to marry her?

110
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,270
That's between Kim and me.

111
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,610
Mom said you only liked her because she was young.

112
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,370
But she isn't. She's old.

113
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,030
Sally.

114
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,000
Open the door.

115
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,500
Come on, sweetheart. Open the door. Sally, please, let's talk about this.

116
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,470
Look, I know...

117
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,970
I know it must be tough.

118
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,020
You've had a long flight, and it's strange being in a new house.

119
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,690
I want to go to bed now.

120
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,140
Okay.

121
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,690
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

122
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,750
You'd be a terrible poker player.

123
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,840
You've been ironing that shirt for half-an-hour.

124
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,810
She sure didn't take to me.

125
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,730
I wouldn't take it personally. She's like that with everybody.

126
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,060
Those pills she takes, what are they?

127
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,690
Adderall, I think.

128
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,520
Jesus.

129
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,320
That's her mother for you. That woman medicated our dogs.

130
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,320
So, what about Jacoby?

131
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,460
His assistant said he still hasn't looked at the new photographs yet.

132
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,880
- He's had them for a week.  - I know.

133
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,300
We're still in the running, and he's still coming to the dinner.

134
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,120
- He should just give us the cover.  - Yes, he should.

135
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,300
He gave it to the Spencer restoration two years ago

136
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,300
and you have done miracles here.

137
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,680
We have done miracles here. It's not all about me.

138
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,180
Thank you.

139
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,810
These are new?

140
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,100
- Yeah.  - Great.

141
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,230
<i>If we get the cover of Architectural Digest,</i>

142
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,900
we won't need to take out another bank loan, will we?

143
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,700
You know what your daughter told me today?

144
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,860
What?

145
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,820
She said your wife gave her to you.

146
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,080
Kids say all kinds of things they don't mean.

147
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,920
It couldn't have gone any worse today.

148
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,050
I feel like the evil stepmother.

149
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,640
The evil and very old stepmother. Let's not forget the old part.

150
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,100
Because I was kind of thinking you were looking a little ancient.

151
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,600
- Oh, yeah?  - Oh, yeah.

152
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,440
The stuffed bear? What was I thinking?

153
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,150
Come on. It's great. She likes it. I saw it in her room.

154
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,570
On her bed?

155
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,700
Well, above the bed. Hanging by a noose.

156
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,860
That's okay. Nice sign of affection, I think.

157
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,970
Sally. Her name is Sally.

158
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,690
Sally!

159
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,220
What do you think?

160
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,310
Yeah. Looks great.

161
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,480
- Have you seen Sally?  - Yeah, she's on the bench.

162
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,110
Sally!

163
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,390
It is not safe for you back here.

164
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,810
Hey. What's going on? Everything okay?

165
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,610
Keep her out from the back of the house.

166
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,980
She could fall in. We'd be in a hell of a mess.

167
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,860
I didn't do anything.

168
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,690
There's pits. Old wells. It's dangerous for a child.

169
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,780
Mr. Harris is right, Sally. He knows. His grandfather worked at the house.

170
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,830
- You shouldn't be back here.  - But I found a basement.

171
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,370
There is no basement.

172
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,370
Easy, Harris. I'll take her. It's okay.

173
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,920
It's there! It's right there!

174
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,460
There's a reason this house is called Fallen Mill.

175
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,170
The English had a mill here, and it fell into a sinkhole.

176
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,760
That's why most of the houses around here don't have basements.

177
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,010
This one does.

178
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,100
- You may want to check this out.  - It's unsafe for a child.

179
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,220
Pull on that.

180
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,100
Look! I told you it was here!

181
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,530
Can you believe this?

182
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,030
This is definitely hollow.

183
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,080
I'm going to get some tools.

184
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,540
- You sure you want to do this now?  - Of course! You kidding?

185
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,960
We can fix this easy if we have to.

186
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,170
You may want to step back.

187
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,470
Mr. Hurst, I...

188
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,660
There's a door in here.

189
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,780
Where did you put the old house keys?

190
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,660
They're in your junk drawer in the office.

191
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,830
Okay.

192
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,170
Have a look.

193
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,360
Oh, wow.

194
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,200
- You be careful, Sally. Okay?  - Okay.

195
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,580
How the hell did we miss this?

196
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,630
That must be the garden window.

197
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,310
It's all of his paints and old color pencils. This is amazing.

198
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,660
Wow. Alex, look at this.

199
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,500
Harris, did you know about this?

200
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,460
This place isn't safe. Especially for kids.

201
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,050
It's okay. I'll keep an eye on her.

202
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,100
This must be where Blackwood worked.

203
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,390
I found another door.

204
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,730
- Look at these sketches.  - It's an ash pit, I think.

205
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,850
Yeah. It's bolted shut.

206
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,940
These are incredible.

207
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,120
Okay. Let's go, Sally.

208
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,630
Come on, Sally. Let's go.

209
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,960
Sally, come on.

210
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,130
This must be like King Tut's tomb for you.

211
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:07,140
Which is why we shouldn't be touching anything. This stuff must be valuable.

212
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,550
- She's gone.  - No, she will come back.

213
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,560
They always do.

214
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,110
Yes, they always do.

215
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,020
I don't think that's important, Alan.

216
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,070
No, I just need to make sure I get the paintings and furniture

217
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,610
back in time for the dinner.

218
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,190
You told me you could.

219
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,490
Come on. How long have we known each other?

220
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,490
I'll write you a post-dated check.

221
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,450
Hold on.

222
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,960
It's either walnut or mahogany, I think. Yeah.

223
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,960
There you are. I thought maybe we could bake scones.

224
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,300
I promised Mrs. Underhill we wouldn't make too much of a mess.

225
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,720
No. That's all right.

226
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,640
What have you got there?

227
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,720
My doll. And my drawing stuff.

228
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,530
Looks like it's just you and I baking scones today.

229
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,910
I made sandwiches for everyone.

230
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,540
Sally, open the grate.

231
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,120
Yes, open the grate. Set us free.

232
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,640
Who are you?

233
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,270
What do you look like?

234
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,800
We've been locked up for so long.

235
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,430
Set us free.

236
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,940
Come down. You'll see what it's like down here.

237
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,610
Wait a minute, will ya?

238
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,080
There's other children down here. They're just like you.

239
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,370
Come and play with them.

240
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,490
Sally?

241
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,160
Sally.

242
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,960
What are you doing down here?

243
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,090
- I heard something.  - Rats, probably. It's time for dinner.

244
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,100
- It was a voice.  - Really smart rats, then.

245
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,770
No! Listen.

246
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,530
Nothing. Come on. Let's go, kiddo.

247
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,800
- I forgot my bag.  - Hurry it up, then.

248
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,050
Sally, now!

249
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,750
We can get this tomorrow. We can't get the rest of these for two weeks.

250
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,460
What about the burnt umber?

251
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,840
It's much warmer, and we can get it for half the price.

252
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,550
You not hungry? Sally?

253
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,770
Don't you like rice?

254
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,970
Mrs. Underhill made apple pie for dessert.

255
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,520
Apple pie has gluten, and Mommy says gluten is bad for my concentration.

256
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,650
Oh, come on. You love apple pie.

257
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,350
We can worry about your concentration tomorrow.

258
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,190
Mommy says no gluten.

259
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,190
What's your mother filling your head with?

260
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,780
- How about some chocolate milk?  - No.

261
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,280
- I'll make something else.  - Hold on.

262
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,280
Sally, you need to eat this, or you can go to your room. Okay?

263
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,830
Good night, Dad.

264
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,260
What?

265
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,590
- Did that work on you when you were a kid?  - She's testing us, Kim.

266
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,340
That's what kids do. Who's the parent here?

267
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,180
Certainly not me.

268
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,810
I didn't mean that.

269
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,890
No. You're right. I'm not a parent.

270
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,780
- We talked about this, remember?  - No, you told me about this, Alex.

271
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,110
I'm not sure I'm ready to be anybody's mother.

272
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,690
I had a hard enough time getting over my own childhood

273
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,570
to have to deal with somebody else's.

274
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,320
Listen, will you help me with this, please?

275
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,870
I realize this is terrible timing, but I don't have a choice.

276
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,660
I can't just send her back.

277
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,540
That's not what I'm asking you to do.

278
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,340
Apple pie.

279
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,180
Thanks.

280
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,360
<i>- Hello?  - Hi, Alex. It's Joanne.</i>

281
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,990
<i>- Hi, Joanne.  - Can I speak to Sally?</i>

282
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,620
<i>- No, you can't.  - Why not?</i>

283
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,450
Because she's asleep. We're three hours ahead, remember?

284
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,410
What were you thinking not telling her she was going to be living here?

285
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,210
You and I had a conversation. I asked you if you wanted me to tell her.

286
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,710
<i>Don't do this every time I have...</i>

287
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,090
You're the one who wanted her here.

288
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,070
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

289
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,860
Did you just speak to me?

290
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,460
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

291
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,500
<i>I love you.</i>

292
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,800
<i>I love you.</i>

293
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,920
<i>I love you.</i>

294
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,050
<i>I love you.</i>

295
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,390
The light, it hurts us.

296
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,940
Yeah. Turn out the light.

297
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,990
<i>I love you.</i>

298
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,030
Turn out the light.

299
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,250
We want to be friends.

300
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,540
Where's my doll?

301
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,040
With us. Sally's doll is with us.

302
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,260
Who are you?

303
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,470
We're your friends.

304
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,020
Friends?

305
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,970
Where?

306
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,010
Come down to the basement and play with us.

307
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,440
Where are you?

308
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,420
What are you?

309
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,960
Hungry.

310
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,630
Hungry.

311
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,010
Very hungry.

312
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,640
I have food.

313
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,860
Let me see you.

314
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,020
I won't hurt you, I promise.

315
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,150
Sally?

316
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,830
- What are you doing under there?  - I'm looking for my doll.

317
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,580
- Looking for what?  - I'm looking for my doll.

318
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,500
How about Teddy instead?

319
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,340
No. That's all right.

320
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,310
- Did you lose a tooth?  - That's not mine.

321
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,760
- I found it.  - You found it? Here in the house?

322
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,650
Yeah.

323
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,570
Can I call Mommy now?

324
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,070
No, it's too late. She's probably asleep.

325
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,900
I don't think you should keep this. It's not very sanitary.

326
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,860
What about this light? Should I...

327
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,830
Leave it on, please.

328
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,320
All right, well, sleep well.

329
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,920
Sally, would you do me a favor?

330
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,290
Would you try to, maybe, be friends with Kim?

331
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,510
- Yes.  - Thanks, kiddo.

332
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,580
Kim, have you seen my razor?

333
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,210
We have to leave in five minutes.

334
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,630
- Yeah. Have you seen my razor?  - Here, take mine.

335
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,590
Five minutes.

336
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,720
My dress.

337
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:54,040
Sally. I want to talk to you downstairs right now.

338
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,630
I cannot believe you cut up Kim's clothes.

339
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,010
I didn't do it.

340
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,810
- I didn't do anything. I swear.  - Stop lying.

341
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,810
It was a horrible thing to do. And it was dangerous.

342
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,360
You could have cut yourself. What did you use, my razor?

343
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,030
Let me see your hands.

344
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,150
- It's mine.  - What is this?

345
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,570
Where did you get this?

346
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,400
- Let me go home.  - You can't go home.

347
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,980
Just let me go home.

348
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,910
I'm sorry about this.

349
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,000
She's never done anything like this before. She's obviously very angry about something.

350
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,790
Alex, that is not anger. That is fear.

351
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,790
We need to go. Mrs. Underhill,

352
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,970
Kim and I have an appointment at the historical society.

353
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,710
We'll be back this afternoon.

354
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,340
Sally, we're going out.

355
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,430
Listen to Mrs. Underhill and do what she says.

356
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,180
And you think about what you need to say to Kim, okay?

357
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,990
Sally.

358
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,710
Are you there?

359
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,050
Did you cut Kim's clothes?

360
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,770
Do you have my dad's razor?

361
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,060
You have to tell me the truth.

362
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,230
If you want to be friends.

363
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,620
I won't be angry.

364
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,320
Sally's not angry.

365
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,910
They're angry.

366
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,460
No, I'm not angry.

367
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,090
They don't want to, but we do.

368
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,720
Come down here, Sally.

369
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,340
Come down and play.

370
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,110
You said you were hungry.

371
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,620
Do you like raisins?

372
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,870
We said we liked them.

373
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,040
See? Delicious.

374
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,930
Delicious. Yeah.

375
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,460
So delicious.

376
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,220
Did you do something bad?

377
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,100
You have to answer if you want to be friends.

378
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,270
Yes, friend.

379
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,980
Sally?

380
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,740
What are you doing down here in the dark?

381
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,990
Were you talking to someone?

382
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,990
Is there someone here with you?

383
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,960
No. I'm all alone.

384
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,370
There's nobody here.

385
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:24,260
Why don't you go help Mrs. Underhill make lunch?

386
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,850
Go on. Off you go now.

387
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,100
That's right. Up those steps! Quick as you can, now!

388
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,320
Harris. You old fool.

389
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:41,370
I swear. I didn't tell them anything!

390
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:14,360
No.

391
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,450
No, please!

392
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,190
Get away!

393
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,410
I had an accident! Call for help!

394
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,770
Don't look.

395
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,820
I could hear screams down there.

396
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,700
- Noises.  - Did you see anything?

397
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,400
He asked me to leave the cellar.

398
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,660
It was so dark in there, he must have stumbled.

399
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,610
- Mr. Hurst, thank God!  - What happened?

400
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,540
- Are you William Harris' employer?  - Yeah.

401
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,870
There's been an accident.

402
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:45,000
- Are you okay? Where's Sally?  - I'm sorry. She saw him.

403
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,210
I tried to cover her eyes, and I was too late.

404
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,960
- Where is she?  - She's in the garden.

405
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,470
I am sorry!

406
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,470
Sally?

407
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,570
Hi.

408
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,990
Are you scared?

409
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,750
Do you want to talk about it?

410
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,830
Is Mr. Harris going to die?

411
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,000
No, Sally.

412
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,840
He is going to be okay.

413
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,650
Can I show you something?

414
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,470
This is my favorite part of the house.

415
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,230
Blackwood loved nature.

416
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,030
He imported these fish from Japan. And so did we.

417
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,990
They're called koi.

418
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,980
They're considered magical.

419
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,950
Badgers can spot them against the mud at the bottom

420
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,530
because of their bright colors.

421
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:50,590
So what makes them special is also what makes them vulnerable.

422
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:53,130
They have to be tough.

423
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,460
And you, too, Sally.

424
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,010
I didn't touch your clothes.

425
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,260
I swear to God, I never touched them!

426
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,780
- I didn't touch them.  - Sally.

427
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:16,780
I didn't! Didn't cut them, I promise.

428
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,110
I don't care about my clothes.

429
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:27,120
I can't really tell. 1804, I think.

430
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,620
It's hard to see. The coin is pretty worn down.

431
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,380
She probably found it in Blackwood's studio.

432
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,630
I don't want her going down there anymore.

433
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,720
I'm worried about her, Kim. It's not safe.

434
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,030
<i>- This is Joanne.  - Mommy?</i>

435
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,860
<i>Oh, sweetie, it's you! How are you?</i>

436
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,990
Can I come home?

437
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,150
<i>You want to come... The sashimi. Stuart, the sashimi.</i>

438
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,490
<i>- I don't like it here.  - You what?</i>

439
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:11,500
<i>Honey, don't fret. It's so beautiful there. You just need to get used to it.</i>

440
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,170
But it's cold.

441
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,580
<i>- Honey, what?  - My bed is too big.</i>

442
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,840
<i>- Sweetheart.  - And I think I'm getting sick.</i>

443
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,630
<i>You're not getting sick.</i>

444
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,560
<i>It will take a little tiny bit of getting used to, but you are going to be so happy there.</i>

445
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,680
<i>Okay? I promise. You'll get used to it.</i>

446
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,100
<i>I got to go, honey. Mommy's got to go.</i>

447
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,760
<i>I'll see you soon. Bye!</i>

448
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,660
Kim?

449
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:43,460
- Don't leave.  - What's wrong?

450
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:46,680
Even when I'm asleep.

451
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,560
And don't turn off the lights.

452
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,850
I'll be right here.

453
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,350
Come on.

454
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:24,980
Kim?

455
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,160
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

456
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,890
Daddy! Daddy!

457
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,190
Daddy, please!

458
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,850
Daddy!

459
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,570
Sally, what's the matter?

460
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:56,530
I don't want them to come anymore.

461
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,610
Who, Sally?

462
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,610
The little things.

463
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,540
They live in the basement. They gave me the silver dollar.

464
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:09,420
They said they wanted to be my friend. But they're horrible and mean.

465
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,880
- You just had a nightmare.  - Don't say that!

466
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,670
It's okay.

467
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:20,050
My bear.

468
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,100
Look what they did to my bear.

469
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:58,390
Your dad tells me art is your favorite subject. I wish I could draw.

470
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,920
Drawing is easy.

471
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,600
The other kids can't do feet and hands.

472
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,350
When you say "the other kids," do you feel they're different from you?

473
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,150
My doctor back home asked me that.

474
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,940
What was your answer?

475
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:20,290
Okay. Let's start with something easier.

476
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,950
What's your favorite color?

477
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,120
What is that? Purple?

478
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,780
Black.

479
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:33,590
How about these little things you saw? What do you think they are?

480
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,060
Fairies.

481
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,010
Or gnomes.

482
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:46,350
But scary ones?

483
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,320
And you say they know your name?

484
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,320
They talk to you?

485
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:00,690
Yes.

486
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,830
What do they say?

487
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,160
They want to play with me.

488
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:11,040
Is that all?

489
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:18,010
They say my parents don't love me.

490
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,550
Can I go now?

491
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,560
<i>Just a few more questions, okay?</i>

492
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:49,160
<i>There is a lot of anxiety in that little girl and a deep belief that she's not wanted.</i>

493
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:52,880
I believe that's what's triggering these fantastic episodes.

494
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:56,880
She told me she found a little tray filled with teeth right inside that fireplace.

495
00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:00,420
Yeah. She found a tooth, but that doesn't mean anything, does it?

496
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,720
She's constructing this elaborate fantasy about wrinkles, claws, fangs.

497
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:08,390
She's individuated each one of those things,

498
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,390
her imaginary world, its inhabitants.

499
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,320
It's as detailed as any I've ever encountered.

500
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,610
What do we do?

501
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,020
I'd like to try her on a stronger medication, for a start.

502
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,320
I'll ask her doctor in LA to send me a copy of her charts.

503
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,370
You call my office, make another appointment.

504
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:23,440
Okay, great.

505
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,740
Meanwhile, I'll give you something to help her sleep.

506
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,340
I'm going to be late. I can't believe it.

507
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,290
If we don't get the extension on this loan, we're not going to get the paintings

508
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,250
or the furniture back on time.

509
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:43,720
We forgot the invitations for the historical society.

510
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:47,170
Maybe we should just postpone the dinner.

511
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,720
<i>Kim, it's Architectural Digest. We have to get the house on the cover.</i>

512
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:51,890
- I know.  - If we don't,

513
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,690
I'm never going to get my career back, and we're not going to sell the place.

514
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,190
- How often have we talked about this?  - What about what's been happening?

515
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,520
Harris? That was an accident.

516
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:01,700
- I'm talking about Sally.  - It's all in her head!

517
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,700
It's real to her. It doesn't matter if we see it.

518
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,620
- Come on!  - Calm down!

519
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:11,490
I'm going to walk. It'll be faster. I'll see you back at home.

520
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,650
I'm not sure how lucid he'll be. He's pretty heavily sedated.

521
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:14,690
Mr. Harris, I know this is difficult,

522
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,690
but I need to understand something.

523
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,320
I need to know what Sally saw so that I can help her.

524
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:26,860
Is she out of the house?

525
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:28,730
No.

526
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,360
Out.

527
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:36,370
She needs to be out of there.

528
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:39,750
Why?

529
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,710
Why was that room sealed up?

530
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,510
Grandfather.

531
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,720
Your grandfather closed it up?

532
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,560
- Yes.  - Why?

533
01:00:58,610 --> 01:00:59,720
After...

534
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:02,730
After...

535
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:07,660
After what?

536
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:10,910
Blackwood.

537
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,870
What about Blackwood?

538
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:22,250
Lot 1134.

539
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,260
Public library.

540
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:31,550
<i>Get her out of the house.</i>

541
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:03,460
<i>The library will be closing in 15 minutes.</i>

542
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:07,970
<i>The library will be closing in 15 minutes. Thank you.</i>

543
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:10,930
Excuse me.

544
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,890
- Can I help you?  - I'm looking for the librarian.

545
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:18,810
Lot 1134.

546
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:23,980
Emerson Blackwood, Special Collections. One sec.

547
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,240
Right this way.

548
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,430
Can't remember the last time anyone requested these. They're beautiful.

549
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,970
I'm a designer. I've been working at Fallen Mill.

550
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,520
Wow. Now, that's a privilege.

551
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:02,560
Personally, I think Emerson Blackwood rivaled Audubon.

552
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,360
Come across his mural?

553
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:07,680
A mural? Where?

554
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:11,270
There in the house, supposedly. If you do, I'd love to see it.

555
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,850
Hello?

556
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:11,170
Now, it's pretty ironic, really.

557
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:15,970
For a committed realist, someone who insisted on drawing only from nature,

558
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,300
to do these at the end of his life.

559
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:21,350
I've looked at everything by Blackwood, and I've never seen any of these.

560
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,180
You wouldn't. The family made it a restricted donation.

561
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:26,980
- These may never be published.  - Is it possible to get copies?

562
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,440
I'll see what I can do.

563
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:33,070
"Wrinkles, claws, teeth?"

564
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,650
Have you ever read Machen?

565
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:37,780
Arthur Machen. Welsh.

566
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,950
He believed in fairy folk,

567
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:44,160
these ancient entities from the netherworld, predating mankind.

568
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:48,500
Blackwood quotes him extensively. Here, that line. There.

569
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,630
"One life must be taken."

570
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,170
These creatures had to take one human life every time they emerged.

571
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,500
to replenish their ranks.

572
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,880
Many of these creatures fed on the bones, the teeth of young children.

573
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:03,300
And then there's a truce, a pact of sorts,

574
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,560
between Pope Sylvester II and these ancient beings

575
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,480
in the year 999.

576
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,980
In exchange for human teeth, they start leaving silver pieces under the pillow.

577
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:23,990
Now, this is the last known drawing by Emerson Blackwood,

578
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,660
made shortly before his disappearance and the loss of his child.

579
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,590
His child?

580
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,920
Blackwood's only son vanished, lost.

581
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:37,720
Not long after, Blackwood himself disappeared without a trace.

582
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,190
No!

583
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:40,440
No! No! Please!

584
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,000
No!

585
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,100
Sally, what's wrong?

586
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,900
Sally, open the door!

587
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,450
Oh, my God!

588
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,590
Dear, thank goodness you're home.

589
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,130
- Where is she?  - I put her to bed.

590
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:48,050
She wouldn't stop screaming.

591
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:00,980
Sally?

592
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:44,490
Kim!

593
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:46,660
She's not down here.

594
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:49,400
I think she's run away. She's done it before.

595
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,740
Once she tried to walk all the way back to LA from our family home in Boston.

596
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,080
I wouldn't be surprised if that's what she's doing.

597
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:10,880
I went and visited Harris today.

598
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,890
Blackwood had a son. Did you know that?

599
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:17,220
And when he was eight, he disappeared.

600
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,180
And Blackwood vanished a few days later.

601
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,020
Why are you telling me this?

602
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,190
A lot of what Blackwood wrote at the end of his life,

603
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:27,270
it's awfully close to Sally's story, gnomes, creatures, all of it.

604
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:28,780
Kim, don't tell me you believe this.

605
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:30,980
Something terrible happened in that basement.

606
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,320
- We need to leave.  - What are you talking about?

607
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,330
Put a million miles between us and that house.

608
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:39,000
Every cent I have is in that house. And you're saying that we just walk away?

609
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:42,170
I accept that my daughter has problems, okay?

610
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,120
Thank you. We all know that.

611
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,500
But they do not involve monsters in the basement.

612
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,970
There she is.

613
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:06,440
Come on, Sally. Get in the car.

614
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:14,280
Sally, please, just tonight, and after the party we'll talk, okay?

615
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:44,320
Four, three, two and one.

616
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,980
There.

617
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:51,820
After the party, I will get you out of here.

618
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:53,650
No matter what. I promise.

619
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,160
- Sally!  - No.

620
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,620
I took it from them.

621
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,370
- You can't have this.  - They stole it. You don't understand.

622
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,710
- I need it to fight back.  - Absolutely not.

623
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,840
Please!

624
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,220
Nobody believes me.

625
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:18,930
Sally, I trust you,

626
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,060
and you can tell me anything at all.

627
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:30,230
They don't like bright lights.

628
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,820
Those things.

629
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,520
They don't?

630
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:41,910
Then I have a good idea.

631
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,630
Mr. Jacoby, I am so glad you could make it.

632
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,580
- Alex, call me Charles.  - Charles.

633
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,170
- My wife, Evelyn.  - Hello, Alex.

634
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:54,800
It's a pleasure. Come on in.

635
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:58,510
The house looks absolutely fantastic.

636
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,020
You've done a remarkable job.

637
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:02,390
Well, thank you.

638
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,600
- We'd love the nickel tour.  - Of course. That's the whole point.

639
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,190
The foyer, obviously.

640
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,690
The mahogany, we shipped from the very same vendor

641
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:13,570
that Blackwood used in London. It's been in business since 1865.

642
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:16,490
You know Bill from the heritage board.

643
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:19,450
Easy, Sally. Not everybody wants to have their photograph taken.

644
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,090
So, Alex, where's Kim?

645
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:39,600
I think she's still upstairs.

646
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,680
Why don't you step into the library, grab a drink, and I'll join you in a moment.

647
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:11,880
Kim, hey, what's going on?

648
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,380
Her drawings. They're exactly Blackwood's sketches.

649
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:18,800
Yeah, I'm sure she probably saw your photographs and copied them.

650
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:20,470
No, she didn't.

651
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,640
Kim, please, Jacoby's here.

652
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:25,970
- Alex, this is your daughter!  - I know.

653
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:28,140
This is serious!

654
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,770
Just because you keep denying it does not mean

655
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,480
- it's not happening.  - Kim, I can't do...

656
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:35,280
Excuse me, Mr. Hurst. When should we serve dinner?

657
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,900
Ten minutes, please. Kim, everybody is waiting. Will you come downstairs?

658
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:41,230
- We can talk about this later.  - No.

659
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,340
- I have proof, Dad. Look!  - Not now, honey.

660
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:57,840
- Please!  - Not now. Come on!

661
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,090
Welcome, everybody.

662
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:06,890
Please, have a seat.

663
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:13,560
If I could just say a few words to all of you friends of Fallen Mill,

664
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:15,740
both big and small.

665
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:19,440
Thank you for joining us this evening. It means a great deal to us.

666
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:24,990
Every aspect of this restoration has followed the exact specifications

667
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:28,240
and materials used in the original construction of the house,

668
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:32,250
including the wood assembling techniques, the layout in the kitchen,

669
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:34,580
even the lacquering process for all the timber.

670
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,170
It's something Kim and I are very proud of, and I'm sure all of you,

671
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:43,340
with your vast array of expertise, will appreciate the attention to detail.

672
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,060
The art you see on the walls, the friezes,

673
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:50,180
even the furniture that you're sitting on,

674
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:54,270
has all been meticulously chosen, reassembled or restored,

675
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,400
depending on its condition,

676
01:14:56,570 --> 01:15:00,690
to, I think, truly represent the essence of the Blackwood collection.

677
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:02,730
So, thank you to the heritage board

678
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:06,150
for their assistance, and to the historical society,

679
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:11,620
and, of course, to our guest of honor, Charles Jacoby.

680
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:17,840
Your interest in our projects is nothing short of inspirational. So, thank you.

681
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:21,170
And finally, to the house itself.

682
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,340
May its newly restored life be long and happy.

683
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:33,770
I guess not everybody is a fan of tonight's menu.

684
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:02,420
Poor Sally. No one believes you.

685
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,630
What do you want?

686
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,460
Please just tell me what you want!

687
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:25,880
We want you!

688
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:32,770
Daddy! Daddy, please!

689
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:37,770
Daddy!

690
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,520
Sally?

691
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,860
- Daddy!  - Sally?

692
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:53,820
Daddy, they're in here!

693
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,080
Open the door!

694
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,170
- Charles.  - What's going on in there?

695
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,310
No! Get off of me! Stop it!

696
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:55,710
Sally!

697
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:02,180
Sally. Sally.

698
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,560
Look at me. Sally, look at me. Look at me.

699
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,190
Picture, I took a picture.

700
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,990
- I think we better call it a night.  - I think we should.

701
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:31,090
It's okay. It's okay.

702
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,780
Alex, can I talk to you?

703
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,500
I feel like I have no idea what to do.

704
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,310
I love my daughter, Kim,

705
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,730
and I love you.

706
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,650
I love you, too.

707
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,070
We should go, right?

708
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:39,910
- I'll get Sally ready.  - I'll get the car.

709
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,100
- Will you put this in the car?  - Yeah.

710
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:39,090
Kim?

711
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:42,010
Hi.

712
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:45,510
Where are we going?

713
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:50,610
We're going to go to a hotel downtown. We're going to get you out of here.

714
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:06,130
Alex?

715
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,920
Alex?

716
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,640
Alex?

717
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:06,280
It's okay, it's okay.

718
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:33,560
A life will be taken.

719
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:36,310
One life must be taken.

720
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,190
A life will be taken.

721
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:48,110
One life must be taken.

722
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:56,660
Sally.

723
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,340
Sally!

724
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,340
Child's teeth!

725
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:08,590
Kim?

726
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:20,850
Kim?

727
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:26,690
Kim?

728
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,200
Daddy?

729
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,880
Kim?

730
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,640
Kim?

731
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:31,510
Kim!

732
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,050
Kim! Please.

733
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:38,010
Kim.

734
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:39,850
Wake up, please!

735
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:43,020
Wake up, Kim. Wake up, Kim.

736
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:46,360
- Wake up, Kim.  - Wake up, Kim.

737
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:47,900
Wake up, Kim.

738
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,880
The key. The key.

739
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,080
Kim, please!

740
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,910
Daddy! No!

741
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,500
Kim!

742
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,680
Kim, please!

743
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:31,130
Sally?

744
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:47,560
Sally? Sally!

745
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:50,560
Kim!

746
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:02,150
Let go of me!

747
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:04,660
Don't make me go in there!

748
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,330
Kim! Please!

749
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:21,920
Kim?

750
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,470
Kim?

751
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,520
- Please, Kim!  - I'm here, Sally!

752
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,280
No, please!

753
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:47,620
Sally!

754
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:54,620
Kim?

755
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,970
No! Go away!

756
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:03,810
Hold on! Hold on! I got you.

757
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:07,390
Keep them away, Sally. Use the light. Use the light.

758
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,890
Kim!

759
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:11,970
Get him.

760
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,240
No! Please!

761
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:25,900
- Get away from me!  - Get off of me!

762
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:38,300
When I cut this rope, Sally, you run!

763
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:39,510
Please!

764
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:41,010
You run! You got that?

765
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:42,840
No, what about you?

766
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,470
- No! Please!  - Be strong.

767
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:07,360
Kim!

768
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:10,870
No!

769
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,550
Sally?

770
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,060
Sally?

771
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:36,850
Sally, are you okay? Sally.

772
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:41,520
Alex?

773
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:48,650
Kim!

774
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:53,450
Kim!

775
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:01,340
Kim!

776
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:07,260
Dad?

777
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:09,670
Daddy?

778
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:15,760
Daddy.

779
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,560
Please!

780
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,130
That's far enough, Sally.

781
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:21,220
I love you, Kim.

782
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:28,880
They will find us. They will find us and hurt us. We must fight.

783
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:34,710
No, we will go deeper, and we will wait.

784
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:38,550
They will forget, and others will come.

785
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:41,270
When will they come? When will we get them?

786
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:44,150
Soon, soon.

787
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,650
- We have all the time in the world.  - Yes.

788
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:54,650
All the time in the world.
