{1435}{1513}Just packed up a real money load,|and it's coming your way.
{1515}{1615}Look for "Rodgers" on the truck's side.|Don't forget my share of the deal.
{5691}{5705}Shit!
{6696}{6779}-Tuna on white, no crust, right?|-I don't know. How is it?
{6795}{6898}Every day, for the last three weeks,|you've come here, asking how the tuna is.
{6900}{6990}Now, it was crappy yesterday.|It was crappy the day before.
{6992}{7059}And guess what? It hasn't changed.
{7074}{7120}-I'll have the tuna.|-No crust?
{7122}{7148}No crust.
{7729}{7756}Thank you.
{8884}{8941}Talk to me, Jesse.|This ain't working, brother.
{8943}{9006}It's your fuel map. It's got a nasty hole.
{9016}{9082}-That's why you're unloading in third.|-Told you.
{9084}{9207}I lengthen the injector pulse a millisecond.|Just tune the NOS timer, you'll run nines.
{9395}{9458}What's up with this fool?|Is he sandwich-crazy?
{9460}{9571}-No. He ain't here for the food, dog.|-Chill out. He's slinging parts for Harry.
{9573}{9657}-I know what he's slinging.|-He's trying to get in Mia's pants, dog.
{9659}{9713}-What's up, guys?|-How you doing, Mia?

{10298}{10346}-What?|-Can I get you anything?
{10388}{10419}You look good.
{10519}{10583}-Thanks a lot, Mia. See you tomorrow.|-Sure.
{10653}{10700}-Tomorrow?|-I love this part.
{10814}{10925}Try Fatburger from now on. Get yourself a|Double Cheese with fries for $2.95, faggot.
{10927}{11011}-I like the tuna here.|-Bullshit. No one likes the tuna here.
{11013}{11047}Yeah, well, I do.
{11347}{11432}Jesus Christ, Dom! Would you get out|there? I'm sick of this shit.
{11434}{11490}I'm not kidding, Dom. Get out there!
{11595}{11655}-What did you put in that sandwich?|-That's funny.
{11657}{11710}-Dom!|-All right.
{12154}{12223}-Hey, man. He was in my face.|-I'm in your face.
{12262}{12332}Relax! Don't push it! You embarrass me!
{12396}{12427}Get over there!
{12463}{12506}Jesse, give me the wallet.
{12575}{12656}"Brian Earl Spilner."|Sounds like a serial killer name.
{12659}{12702}-ls that what you are?|-No, man.
{12704}{12751}Don't come around here again.
{12809}{12855}Hey, man. This is bullshit.
{12880}{12952}-You work for Harry, right?|-Yeah. I just started.
{12957}{12994}You were just fired.
{13304}{13379}Hey, Dominic.|I appreciate what you did, in a big way.
{13391}{13427}Dominic, I owe you.
{13473}{13582}Brian, you're messing with my business.|When Dominic drives, he's golden.
{13585}{13696}Kids pour in. They want everything he has.|Every performance part. They pay cash!
{13709}{13775}-What did Dominic say?|-You don't want to know.
{13783}{13852}-What did Dominic say?|-He wants you out of here.
{13866}{13913}-He wants me out of here?|-Yes.
{13915}{13994}-And what did you say to Dom?|-What do you think I said?
{14001}{14061}I told him, "Good help is hard to find."
{14137}{14162}Relax.
{14250}{14280}I need NOS.
{14293}{14346}-I need NOS.|-No.
{14350}{14417}My car topped out at 140 miles per hour,|this morning.
{14419}{14525}Amateurs don't use nitrous oxide. I've|seen how you drive. You've a heavy foot.
{14544}{14619}-You'll blow yourself to pieces.|-I need one of these.
{14625}{14706}One of the big ones.|Actually, let's make it two.
{14718}{14770}And, Harry, I need it by tonight.
{16491}{16570}Hold up, hold up.|Look at this snowman right here, man.
{16674}{16742}Sweet ride.|What you running under there, man?
{16808}{16877}-Going to make me find out the hard way?|-Hell, yeah.
{16879}{16948}You brave. You brave.|They call me Hector.
{16963}{17030}I got a last name, too,|but I can't pronounce it.
{17032}{17091}-Brian Spilner.|-Typical white-boy name.
{17099}{17144}Know what I'm saying?
{17199}{17316}See that over there? That's mine.|My baby. I ain't cutting her loose tonight.
{17323}{17367}-Why not?|-I'm going legit, homey.
{17369}{17433}Trying to get on the NIRA circuit.|Heard about that?
{17435}{17507}-Hell, yeah.|-So, what's up with you, man?
{17512}{17612}-I'm just waiting for Toretto.|-Shit. Better get in line. This yours?
{17640}{17700}-I'm standing next to it.|-That's funny.
{17703}{17767}You know,|Edwin happens to know a few things.
{17819}{17872}And one of the things Edwin knows is:|It's not how you stand by your car...
{17882}{17952}...it's how you race your car.|You better learn that.
{18095}{18165}Oh, shit. Here they come. It's on.
{18534}{18577}-Dom.|-Marvin.
{18618}{18704}-Hey, Dom. How you doing?|-Hey, Camille. You been doing yoga?
{18809}{18879}You did? Of course you did. Monica.
{18948}{18996}I smell skanks.
{19013}{19106}Why don't you girls pack it up,|before I leave tread marks on your face?
{19108}{19130}Okay.
{19136}{19200}-Letty, I was just talking.|-Yeah. Whatever.
{19210}{19282}-Okay, Hector.|-Yeah? What's up, man?
{19323}{19360}-Yo. What's up?|-Edwin.
{19362}{19419}-How we doing this tonight?|-One race.
{19431}{19530}$2,000 buy-in. Winner takes all.|Hector, you're going to hold the cash.
{19542}{19614}-Why Hector?|-Too slow to make away with the money.
{19673}{19737}-Okay. Good luck, guys.|-Hey, wait. Hold up.
{19749}{19842}I don't have any cash.|But I do have the pink slip to my car.
{19853}{19945}You just can't climb in the ring with Ali,|'cause you think you box.
{19950}{20028}He knows I can box. Check it out.|It's like this.
{20052}{20127}I lose, the winner takes my car.|Clean and clear.
{20137}{20218}But if I win, I take the cash,|and I take the respect.
{20233}{20258}Respect.
{20314}{20371}To some people, that's more important.
{20422}{20454}That your car?
{20545}{20661}I see a cool air intake. It's got a NOS|fogger system and a T 4 turbo, Dominic.
{20665}{20784}I see an AIC controller.|It has direct port nitrous injection.
{20790}{20857}Yeah. And a stand-alone|fuel management system.
{20881}{20931}Not a bad way to spend $10,000.
{21003}{21038}You see that shit?
{21059}{21138}He's got enough NOS in there|to blow himself up. Period.
{21160}{21236}-So, what do you say? Am I worthy?|-We don't know yet.
{21253}{21296}But you're in. Let's go.
{21317}{21354}-All right.|-Let's go!
{22899}{22991}-What the hell is going on around here?|-Street's closed, pizza boy.
{23003}{23073}-Find another way home.|-Goddamn street racers.
{23091}{23194}"Log on, 22. Code 3. Tension is high".|"They've blocked the street".
{24301}{24334}Edwin.
{24371}{24442}This is yours, whether you win or lose.
{24463}{24526}But if you win, you get her, too.
{24754}{24791}You're going to win.
{24824}{24862}I'm going to win.
{25926}{25995}"We had a reported homicide".|"187, at Barabian Liquors".
{25997}{26102}I've got a 187 in Glendale.|Cops are all over it. We're good to roll.
{26119}{26153}-All right.|-Let's race!
{26155}{26180}Right.
{26414}{26433}Go!
{26772}{26799}Hell, yeah!
{27184}{27223}Damn, that guy's fast.
{27419}{27471}Let's go! Ménage!
{28119}{28186}No! Monica!
{28564}{28599}Shut up!
{29911}{29947}Well done, baby!
{30172}{30218}Come on. Come on. Back up.
{30237}{30317}Here's what you won, right here.|There you go.
{30319}{30388}You were racing a bunch of skateboards.|Know what I mean?
{30422}{30486}My sister holds the money. Count it.
{30559}{30597}And you're my trophy.
{30675}{30770}-Hey, Monica. What's up, baby?|-What's your problem? You didn't win.
{30841}{30872}Fuck you then!
{31191}{31222}Was that fun?
{31227}{31273}Got a problem there, buddy?
{31434}{31512}-What are you smiling about?|-Dude. I almost had you.
{31580}{31623}You almost had me?
{31639}{31698}You never had me.|You never had your car.
{31777}{31853}Granny-shifting.|Not double-clutching, like you should.
{31875}{31975}You're lucky that 100-shot of NOS|didn't blow the welds on the intake.
{32005}{32110}-Almost had me?|-You tell him, Dominic. Get out of here.
{32143}{32217}Now, me and the mad scientist|got to rip apart the block...
{32219}{32281}...and replace the piston rings you fried.
{32467}{32516}Ask any racer. Any real racer.
{32534}{32641}It don't matter if you win by an inch|or a mile. Winning's winning.
{32648}{32680}Yeah!
{32814}{32888}{y:i}All available units,|"we have street-racing along Hawthorne"...
{32890}{32936}Oh, shit! We got cops. Cops!
{32943}{32973}Go!
{33254}{33297}Cops! Get in the car! Go!
{35317}{35370}{y:i}Toretto, stop right there!
{35411}{35438}{y:i}Toretto!
{35798}{35827}Get in!
{36942}{37022}You're the last person in the world|I expected to show up.
{37050}{37144}I thought if I got in your good graces,|you might let me keep my car.
{37150}{37230}You are in my good graces,|but you ain't keeping your car.
{37251}{37323}You drive like you've done this before.|Are you a wheelman?
{37325}{37382}-No.|-You boost cars?
{37440}{37492}-No. Never.|-Ever done time?
{37501}{37557}Couple of overnighters. No big deal.
{37575}{37648}What about the two years|in juvie for boosting cars?
{37719}{37755}Tucson, right?
{37772}{37846}I had Jesse run a profile on you,|Brian Earl Spilner.
{37883}{37959}He'll find anything on the Web.|Anything about anybody.
{37976}{38010}So, why bullshit?
{38051}{38087}So, what about you?
{38146}{38182}Two years in Lompoc.
{38255}{38298}I'll die before I go back.
{38445}{38493}-Oh, great.|-What?
{38563}{38620}It's going to be a long-ass night.|That's what.
{38723}{38756}Follow us.
{39972}{40073}I thought we had an agreement.|You stay away. I stay away.
{40107}{40146}Everybody stays happy.
{40149}{40205}We got lost.|What do you want me to tell you?
{40207}{40277}-Who's "we"?|-My new mechanic.
{40286}{40330}Brian, meet Johnny Tran.
{40333}{40405}The guy in the snakeskin pants.|That's his cousin. Lance.
{40407}{40496}So, when are you going to give me a shot|at that Honda 2000 of yours?
{40498}{40556}-This your ride?|-lt was. It's his now.
{40566}{40626}No, it's not. I haven't taken delivery.
{40678}{40767}Then, it's nobody's car.|But somebody put in the wrench time.
{40840}{40927}-What do you think, Lance?|-lt's an amazing machine.
{40943}{40978}Yes, indeed.
{41031}{41065}Let's go.
{41117}{41223}I'll see you in the desert next month.|Be ready to have your ass handed to you.
{41229}{41322}-You'll need more than that crotch rocket.|-I got something for you.
{41655}{41740}-What the hell was that all about?|-Long story. I'll tell you later.
{41742}{41781}Let's get out of here.
{42438}{42465}NOS!
{42757}{42839}-So, what the hell was that all about?|-lt's a long story.
{42860}{42906}Well, we got a 20-mile hike. Humor me.
{42930}{42981}A business deal that went sour.
{43004}{43078}Plus, I made the mistake|of sleeping with his sister.
{43706}{43736}Take care.
{43858}{43895}Yo, Spilner.
{43929}{43982}-You want a beer?|-Yeah, sure.
{43998}{44036}Oh, shit.
{44613}{44684}We were all there, right? Falling behind.
{44686}{44745}-With all that nitrous.|-Yeah.
{44910}{44993}Yo, Dom. We were just about to go|looking for you, brother.
{45135}{45166}Where were you?
{45168}{45270}There were mass cops there. They came in|from every direction. It was orchestrated.
{45272}{45329}-This your beer?|-Yeah, that's my beer.
{45403}{45463}Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs.
{45479}{45540}You can't detail a car with the cover on.
{45560}{45629}-Can't even get that right.|-You all right?
{45681}{45750}-Am I all right?|-lt was just a question.
{45840}{45871}Yo, Dom.
{45877}{45975}-Why did you bring the buster here?|-'Cause he kept me out of handcuffs!
{45981}{46073}He didn't just run back to the fort!|The buster brought me back.
{46214}{46304}You can have any brew you want,|as long as it's a Corona.
{46320}{46383}-Thanks, man.|-That's Vince's. So, enjoy it.
{46431}{46461}You.
{46632}{46730}-Hey, bro. You got a bathroom?|-Upstairs. First door on the right.
{47119}{47201}He's got no call being up in here.|You don't know that fool for shit.
{47203}{47287}-He's right, Dom.|-There was a time when I didn't know you.
{47291}{47337}That was in the third grade!
{47414}{47498}-Yeah. So, what girls are here?|-You name it. You want mine?
{47500}{47558}-You need to shut the...|-You want two?
{47563}{47627}-You don't have anything?|-You look a bit tired.
{47629}{47696}I think you should go upstairs|and give me a massage.
{47698}{47779}-Look at all our guests.|-How about you give me a massage?
{47859}{47894}Crazy lady.
{48078}{48142}You know you owe me|a 10-second car, right?
{48253}{48284}Oh, shit.
{48422}{48461}Did you wipe the seat?
{48539}{48620}Jesus Christ! Would you cut this shit?|Come on!
{48730}{48762}-Come on. Let's go get me a drink.|-We were just about to get along.
{48960}{49036}-So, what do you want?|-Anything, as long as it's cold.
{49075}{49161}You know, my brother likes you.|He usually doesn't like anybody.
{49163}{49241}-He's a complicated guy.|-Yeah? What about you?
{49318}{49374}-I'm simpler.|-You're a shitty liar.
{49415}{49471}Well, I'll take that as a compliment.
{49511}{49575}-But there's a problem.|-What's that?
{49577}{49630}You need to get some sleep.
{49644}{49739}And you definitely,|definitely need a shower.
{49762}{49817}Come on. I'll take you home.
{50340}{50410}"Show me your hands".|"Very good. Now open the door".
{50422}{50497}"Put your hands on your head".|"Behind your head".
{50510}{50596}{y:i}Face the front of the vehicle,|"walk backwards towards the rear".
{50601}{50682}"Take two steps to your right".|"Stop right there".
{50755}{50850}-What did I do?|-Shut up. He's clean, Sarge.
{51108}{51164}Damn!|Muse, will you take these things off?
{51166}{51236}-Shit. You put them on so tight.|-I like realism.
{51251}{51307}You never know who's watching, Brian.
{51410}{51501}Nice crib, Sergeant. It's a lot nicer|than the last place you confiscated.
{51503}{51604}Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house|for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.
{51608}{51678}You see, even the cops|are Hollywood in Hollywood.
{51768}{51848}Okay, here he is,|fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven.
{51850}{51906}That was an $80,000 vehicle, Officer.
{51908}{51961}-You told him what happened?|-He knows.
{51963}{52057}-Send the bill to Johnny Tran.|-The kid's giving me attitude?
{52059}{52125}It doesn't speak well|for police/FBI relations, Tanner.
{52127}{52214}-I walk in the door and the guy's already...|-All right, all right.
{52216}{52269}We'll talk, okay? Let's talk about it.
{52271}{52350}Muse, why don't you make us|four iced cappuccinos, please?
{52352}{52408}-Come on.|-Regular or decaf, Sarge?
{52446}{52480}Decaf, I think.
{52488}{52553}Four hijackings in two months,|and we have nothing.
{52555}{52629}The DVD players and digital cameras|are worth $1.2 million...
{52631}{52698}...which brings the grand total|to $6 million plus.
{52700}{52768}We're in the political crosshairs now, Brian.
{52786}{52830}That's why you're undercover.
{52832}{52927}You want that detective badge fast, kid.|And you want to know something?
{52935}{53003}The FBI can help,|if you come through for us.
{53028}{53075}What does the truckdriver say?
{53077}{53162}He gave us the same M.O.:|Three Honda Civics, precision driving...
{53164}{53235}...the same green neon glow|from under the chassis.
{53237}{53344}Lab says the skidmarks came back|the same: Mashamoto ZX tires.
{53346}{53411}So, we know it's somebody|in the street-racing world.
{53413}{53520}If we don't make this case, the truckers|will take matters into their own hands.
{53522}{53563}I tell them we're close.
{53592}{53638}Are you going to make me a liar?
{53640}{53677}Look, what do we know?
{53679}{53739}We know this world|revolves around Toretto, right?
{53741}{53815}I'm not saying that he's the one|that's popping these trucks...
{53817}{53921}...but I can guarantee he knows who is.|It's just a matter of time until I win...
{53923}{54018}You want time, buy the magazine.|We don't have time.
{54061}{54111}Just get me something I can use.
{54155}{54195}Is Harry cooperating?
{54197}{54283}Like a guy that'll do time|for receiving stolen property if he doesn't.
{54285}{54336}What kind of vibe|is he getting from Toretto?
{54338}{54413}He's scared of him,|but he doesn't think he's jacking trucks.
{54415}{54472}-He's too controlled for that.|-Wait.
{54474}{54549}Not that I want to contradict|Harry's fine judge of character...
{54551}{54636}...but Toretto did hard time|for nearly beating a guy to death.
{54638}{54713}He's got nitrous oxide in his blood|and a gas tank for a brain.
{54715}{54761}Do not turn your back on him.
{54771}{54808}Tanner, I'm gonna need another car.
{54941}{54999}-What about parts and service?|-Hold off on it.
{55001}{55057}Dom, I don't know what to do with it.
{55131}{55223}All right, what the hell is this?|What do you got there?
{55265}{55323}-This is your car.|-My car?
{55338}{55409}I said a 10-second car, not a 10-minute car.
{55411}{55503}You could push this across the finish line,|or tow it.
{55534}{55604}You couldn't even tow that|across the finish line.
{55622}{55651}No faith.
{55653}{55711}I have faith in you,|but this isn't a junkyard.
{55713}{55767}-This is a garage.|-Pop the hood.
{55774}{55804}-Pop the hood?|-Pop the hood.
{55879}{55967}-2JZ engine. No shit.|-And what did I tell you?
{55969}{56035}-I retract my previous statement.|-You know what?
{56037}{56147}This will decimate all|after you put about $15,000 in it.
{56149}{56239}Or more,|if we have to overnight parts from Japan.
{56250}{56315}-We'll put it on my tab at Harry's.|-Yes!
{56325}{56416}I gotta get you racing again|so I can make some money off your ass.
{56429}{56494}There's a show down in the desert|called Race Wars.
{56496}{56551}That's where you'll do it.
{56560}{56640}When you're not working at Harry's,|you're working here.
{56646}{56736}If you can't find the right tool|in this garage, Mr. Arizona...
{56768}{56798}...you don't belong near a car.
{56884}{56917}He owns you now.
{57572}{57615}Tell me what you think about this.|Koni adjustables.
{57635}{57688}Gonna save us about 2 pounds.
{57693}{57773}And they're gonna give us|better traction for the hole shot.
{57775}{57805}All right?
{57825}{57875}This is your basic layout of the car.
{57877}{57969}And that's pretty much|what it could look like when it's finished.
{57987}{58020}Red, green.
{58035}{58120}-You should be going to MIT or something.|-Yeah, right.
{58136}{58204}No, I got that... What's it called?
{58230}{58282}That attention disorder...
{58284}{58373}-ADD?|-Yes, that shit. Yeah.
{58400}{58494}You know, I was good in algebra|and like math and shit.
{58514}{58604}Everything else I failed.|Dropped out of school.
{58625}{58700}I don't know.|It's just something about engines...
{58702}{58777}...that calms me down, you know.
{59277}{59336}-I'm outta here.|-Come on, dog.
{59351}{59415}-Yo, Dom.|-Vince, get over here and give us a hand.
{59417}{59487}Looks like you got|all the help you need, brother.
{59815}{59890}-Mia! The chicken's dry.|-All right. I'm coming out already.
{60018}{60054}Here you go.
{60100}{60134}Hey, hold up.
{60146}{60272}Because you were the first to reach in|to get the chicken, you say grace.
{60416}{60481}-Dear heavenly...|-Spirit.
{60521}{60561}Spirit. Thank you.
{60574}{60699}Thank you for providing us|with a direct port nitrous injection...
{60722}{60814}...four core intercoolers|and ball-bearing turbos...
{60818}{60878}...and titanium valve springs.
{60896}{60935}-Thank you.|-Amen.
{60962}{61009}-Not bad.|-Amen.
{61011}{61065}He was praying to the car gods, man.
{61097}{61134}He's not the best.
{61136}{61188}-What do you want?|-Practice.
{61190}{61222}Thank you, girl.
{61224}{61310}Look who it is. "Old Coyotes 'R' Us."
{61312}{61378}I thought you weren't hungry, pumpkin.
{61382}{61453}-You know, I gotta eat.|-He's always hungry.
{61455}{61504}All right, sit down.
{61681}{61727}How you doing, Mia?
{61803}{61842}Here you go.
{61997}{62063}-Jesse, hand me that chicken.|-Let's eat some grub, man.
{62065}{62140}-Want some of that chicken?|-What, you rent a movie or something?
{62310}{62356}Need a hand with anything else?
{62358}{62441}No, I'm good. You can go join the boys|and watch the movie.
{62453}{62541}-The cook doesn't clean where I come from.|-I'd like to go there.
{62665}{62766}-I think we should go out sometime.|-No, I don't date my brother's friends.
{62783}{62819}That sucks.
{62821}{62901}-I'll have to kick his ass then.|-I'd love to see that one.
{62903}{62982}I would pay to see that one, actually.
{63316}{63357}Wash my car when you get done.
{63359}{63447}-What was that?|-No, Mia. I'm talking to the punk.
{63467}{63526}Wear your favorite dress,|'cause when you're done...
{63528}{63607}...l'm putting you on the street|where you belong, cutie.
{63686}{63775}Is this thing broken?|What's wrong with this thing?
{63805}{63901}What was that Cuban restaurant|you wanted to take me to?
{63905}{63953}The one with the picadillo and...
{63955}{64046}-With red candles, wooden tables...|-The plantain, food all over the place.
{64048}{64093}-What it's called?|-Cha Cha Cha.
{64095}{64142}-Yeah, that's it.|-Yeah.
{64170}{64218}Well, you can take me there.
{64221}{64284}Friday night at 10:00. Is that good for you?
{64299}{64348}-Yeah, it's perfect.|-Good.
{64502}{64596}-There's no popcorn.|-Make your own goddamn popcorn!
{64932}{64994}All right. Now that's valet parking.
{65088}{65143}-Harry. What's up, dog?|-Nice to see you.
{65145}{65189}Excellent. Come on in, man.
{65191}{65266}-Check it. It's yours.|-Damn. What do we got here?
{65293}{65353}-Hired some new help?|-Don't even think about it.
{65355}{65414}-What's up?|-What's up, Brian? How you feeling?
{65416}{65486}-Pretty good. What do you need?|-What's up, man?
{65488}{65573}I need you to hook me up.|Three of everything. I made a list.
{65612}{65659}Why don't you look that over?
{65666}{65742}-When do you need this stuff by?|-Tomorrow, today, now.
{65752}{65806}-Right.|-White boys work fast, don't they?
{65884}{65916}That's right.
{65985}{66069}-You said you need three of each?|-Yeah, three of everything.
{66088}{66152}What do you think about that?|Check this out.
{69224}{69261}He moans like a cop.
{69484}{69584}Brian, this is one of those times|you need to be clear about what you say.
{69602}{69650}Nod if you understand me.
{69652}{69683}Nod!
{69727}{69761}Sit up.
{69911}{69975}Tell me what the hell you're doing|down here.
{69982}{70041}Shit. What I'm doing?
{70103}{70136}Dom.
{70190}{70255}I owe you a 10-second car.
{70278}{70365}And what this is about,|this is about Race Wars.
{70441}{70534}I just went in there,|and Hector is gonna be running...
{70545}{70606}...three Honda Civics with Spoon engines.
{70609}{70677}And on top of that,|he just came into Harry's...
{70679}{70781}...and he ordered three T66 turbos,|with NOS...
{70820}{70870}...and a MoTeC system exhaust.
{70954}{70995}So, what are you saying?
{71024}{71133}You're gonna check everybody's shit out,|one garage after another?
{71202}{71237}Yeah.
{71305}{71399}Because, Dom, you know I can't lose again.
{71447}{71480}He's a cop.
{71536}{71563}He's a cop!
{71642}{71674}You a cop?
{71830}{71874}Let's go for a little ride.
{71946}{71979}Walk!
{72444}{72485}Okay. You stand watch.
{73222}{73262}Yo, Dominic.
{73304}{73344}There's no engines.
{73371}{73437}What are they planning on racing with,|hopes and dreams?
{73439}{73497}I don't know, but they're sneaky as shit...
{73499}{73567}...and they've got enough money|to buy anything.
{73691}{73714}What?
{73933}{73965}We got a wolf pack.
{73977}{74065}/"t's Johnny Tran,"|"and he's coming your way really fast".
{74076}{74139}All right, we got company. Spilner.
{74762}{74817}Come on. Move!
{74823}{74872}Let me ask you a question, Ted.
{74908}{74985}-Do you see anything wrong here?|-No.
{75078}{75136}-We got no engines, do we?|-No.
{75138}{75169}-Do we?|-No.
{75243}{75305}A couple of Nissan SR20 motors|will pull a premium...
{75307}{75380}-...one week before Race Wars, huh?|-Yeah, probably.
{75389}{75461}You're a smart fence, Ted.|Maybe too smart.
{75497}{75543}What are you feeling, Lance?
{75579}{75616}40-weight?
{75628}{75672}50-weight?
{75687}{75728}A 40-weight sounds nice.
{76102}{76139}Where are they, Ted?
{76143}{76187}-Where are they?|-Enough!
{76191}{76251}-Where are they?|-They're in a warehouse.
{76264}{76310}They're in a warehouse, man!
{76700}{76731}Ted.
{76733}{76773}Kiss my shoes?
{77067}{77112}Let's go get our engines.
{77133}{77200}My superiors are flying in from D.C.,|in two days.
{77202}{77241}I want something to show.
{77243}{77303}We've got a fence|with a lube hose in his mouth...
{77305}{77392}...automatic weapons,|priors on every one of these Asian punks...
{77394}{77474}...a garage full of DVD players|and generally psychotic behavior.
{77476}{77557}Tell me why we shouldn't move|on Tran now and figure it out later?
{77559}{77601}Because all we have is behavior.
{77603}{77677}Let me get hard evidence,|because what we have now is just...
{77679}{77727}What we have is probable cause.
{77729}{77822}And truckers arming themselves for some|good old-fashioned vigilante mayhem.
{77824}{77922}-Tell us about Hector, Brian.|-Latinos with spear guns. Give me a break.
{77928}{78014}Hector's still working on the engines,|but the tires don't match.
{78016}{78059}Will somebody give me a cigarette?
{78061}{78112}-Get him a cigarette.|-Don't give him one.
{78118}{78177}-I thought you quit.|-I did. Just give me one.
{78179}{78221}-Get him a cigarette.|-No!
{78276}{78315}Tell me about Toretto.
{78321}{78388}I told you,|I think he's too controlled for this.
{78390}{78501}Going suicidal on semi-trucks? No way.|Maybe Vince. But he's too dumb to do it.
{78510}{78598}-I think the kid sister's blurring your vision.|-What did you say?
{78600}{78686}I don't blame you.|I'd get off on her surveillance photos, too.
{78753}{78783}Knock it off!
{78811}{78872}What? Are you going native on me, Brian?
{78984}{79038}Have you read Toretto's file lately?
{79044}{79100}-Yeah. I memorized that file.|-Read it again.
{79102}{79160}No, better still, take a look at these.
{79203}{79284}Remember I told you about the guy|he nearly beat to death?
{79294}{79373}Toretto did this|with a three-quarter-inch torque wrench.
{79385}{79432}He's a model of self-control.
{79502}{79543}I need a few more days.
{79609}{79638}I need a few more days.
{79708}{79746}Got a TR7 here,|with a ball-bearing upgrade.
{79779}{79872}What it's going to do is,|it's going to spool up really quick.
{79876}{79936}-I got this set up for 24 psi.|-Got it.
{80020}{80063}You got big plans tonight?
{80114}{80166}Yeah. We're going out to dinner.
{80204}{80266}You break her heart, I'll break your neck.
{80281}{80317}That's not gonna happen.
{80441}{80485}I want to show you something.
{80827}{80868}Me and my dad built her.
{80889}{80946}Nine hundred horses of Detroit muscle.
{80977}{81007}It's a beast.
{81021}{81090}-You know what she ran in Palmdale?|-No. What?
{81094}{81129}Nine seconds flat.
{81165}{81216}-God.|-My dad was driving.
{81229}{81330}So much torque,|the chassis twisted coming off the line.
{81356}{81403}Barely kept her on the track.
{81421}{81491}-So, what's your best time?|-I've never driven her.
{81493}{81519}Why not?
{81585}{81632}It scares the shit out of me.
{81690}{81720}That's my dad.
{81756}{81821}He was coming up|in the pro stock-car circuit.
{81831}{81872}Last race of the season.
{81899}{82000}A guy named Kenny Linder|came up from inside, in the final turn.
{82020}{82104}He clipped his bumper|and put him into the wall at 120.
{82180}{82237}I watched my dad burn to death.
{82298}{82348}I remembered hearing him scream.
{82424}{82533}But the people that were there|said he had died before the tanks blew.
{82686}{82743}They said it was me who was screaming.
{82828}{82886}I saw Linder about a week later.
{82919}{83001}I had a wrench, and I hit him.
{83009}{83122}And I didn't intend to keep hitting him,|but when I finished, I couldn't lift my arm.
{83251}{83306}He's a janitor at a high school.
{83333}{83394}He has to take the bus to work every day.
{83423}{83488}And they banned me|from the tracks for life.
{83623}{83683}I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.
{83727}{83794}Nothing else matters.|Not the mortgage, not the store...
{83796}{83856}...not my team and all their bullshit.
{83897}{83954}For those 10 seconds or less...
{83990}{84030}...l'm free.
{84521}{84599}So, how is it, anyways,|that the gang came to be?
{84605}{84632}-What?|-The gang.
{84634}{84692}The gang?|No, they don't call themselves a gang.
{84694}{84750}-What do they call themselves?|-They're a team.
{84752}{84848}-They call themselves a team.|-All right. How did the team come to be?
{84859}{84914}Well, that's a whole lot of history.
{84948}{85037}-I've got time.|-Okay. Vince grew up with my brother.
{85060}{85135}Actually, he didn't ever actually grow up,|as you can tell.
{85137}{85185}But they were friends as kids.
{85190}{85252}And Letty, she just lived down the street.
{85256}{85334}Always into cars, though.|Ever since she was, like, 10 years old.
{85336}{85422}So, naturally, you know,|my brother always had her attention.
{85438}{85526}-And then she turned 16...|-And then she had Dom's attention.
{85533}{85603}Yeah. It's funny how that works, isn't it?
{85621}{85651}Yeah.
{85730}{85790}How does Jesse fit into the whole thing?
{85793}{85912}Jesse. Well, Jesse and Leon just sort of|showed up one night and never, ever left.
{85932}{86011}It's just the way my brother is, you know.|Dom's like...
{86048}{86095}He's like gravity.
{86122}{86175}Everything just gets pulled to him.
{86214}{86247}Even you.
{86300}{86333}No.
{86336}{86369}No.
{86380}{86448}The only thing that pulled me in was you.
{86450}{86518}Being friends with your brother|is just a bonus.
{86584}{86621}That's good.
{86665}{86750}That's good. It's nice to come first|every once in a while.
{86837}{86862}Want to go for a drive?
{87790}{87844}-Yeah?|"-The hijackers have hit again".
{87846}{87968}{y:i}Bilkins has decided that we're gonna move|"on Johnny Tran and his guys at 17:00".
{87970}{88015}"Unless you say otherwise".
{88017}{88062}/"f you agree, just say yes".
{88077}{88125}-Yeah.|-Who is that?
{88179}{88221}It's just a wrong number.
{92350}{92402}Yes, sir. Yeah, I know, but...
{92407}{92471}Yeah. Yes, sir.
{92476}{92510}Yeah. I got it.
{92615}{92664}The DVD players were purchased legally.
{92666}{92744}All we've got are a couple|of low-rent weapons charges...
{92746}{92801}...and some outstanding speeding tickets.
{92803}{92843}-So, they're out.|-Yeah.
{92848}{92886}Father bailed them out.
{92913}{93003}Is this the kind of intelligence|I can expect from you, O'Conner?
{93119}{93195}-You're gonna put this on me?|-I can put it on whoever I want to.
{93197}{93262}-Perks of the job.|-No, you can't put this on me...
{93264}{93309}No, wait a minute. Let me tell you.
{93311}{93412}I don't care if you have to aim at someone|and blow your cover to smithereens.
{93414}{93475}You've got 36 hours to crack this bastard...
{93477}{93551}...or you might want to think|about another career.
{93816}{93898}It's Toretto, Brian.|It always has been Toretto.
{93931}{93976}Tran and Hector are...
{93986}{94029}They're just fumes.
{94107}{94172}I know you've been lying to me.|My question is this:
{94174}{94262}Have you been lying to yourself|because you can't see past Mia?
{94325}{94373}He won't go back to prison.
{94396}{94465}Well, that's a choice|he's going to have to make.
{94563}{94621}There's all kinds of family, Brian.
{94655}{94722}And that's a choice|you're gonna have to make.
{95154}{95202}You ready for this?
{95835}{95903}Nice car.|What's the retail on one of those?
{95918}{95980}More than you can afford, pal. Ferrari.
{96128}{96164}Smoke him.
{97481}{97524}So, what's wrong, Brian?
{97547}{97588}Nothing, man, I'm fine.
{97599}{97677}Come on. Obviously something's off.
{97690}{97779}Look, I have my good days and bad days|just like anybody else.
{97795}{97881}Brian, don't lose that cool of yours.|That's your meal ticket.
{97928}{97996}My meal ticket?|I can't pay for my own shrimp?
{98000}{98035}I got the shrimp.
{98045}{98107}No, that's one thing about me|you don't understand.
{98109}{98197}I don't take handouts.|I earn my way, every step.
{98219}{98276}I need something extra on the side,|like you.
{98278}{98325}What do you mean, like me?
{98332}{98401}-What's that supposed to mean?|-That's what I mean.
{98403}{98468}-What does that mean, like me?|-Don't try...
{98475}{98521}I'm not stupid, all right?
{98530}{98628}I know that there's no way you paid|for all that shit you got under the hood...
{98630}{98711}There's no way you paid for|what's under the hood of those cars...
{98713}{98779}...by doing tune-ups and selling groceries.
{98799}{98871}Whatever it is you're in on,|I want in on it, too.
{99419}{99469}-Well, what is this?|-Read it.
{99488}{99543}-What is this for?|-lt's directions.
{99591}{99632}To Race Wars.
{99644}{99687}We'll see how you go.
{99711}{99750}Then we'll talk.
{100860}{100899}-How's it going?|-What's up?
{100901}{100965}-Welcome to Race Wars.|-Great. Thanks a lot.
{101526}{101567}Baby. Hey, baby.
{101595}{101639}You should watch from the side.
{101641}{101700}I wouldn't want to get exhaust|on that pretty face.
{101702}{101800}-Put your money where your mouth is.|-I'll race you for that sweet little ass.
{101802}{101861}You want ass,|why don't you hit Hollywood Boulevard?
{101863}{101937}You want an adrenaline rush,|it'll be two large.
{101939}{102011}Right here. Right now.|What's it gonna be?
{102075}{102109}You got it.
{102589}{102638}"Another one bites the dust"
{102717}{102763}Come on. What you got?
{102780}{102815}See ya.

{104109}{104218}That way, me and my dad can roll|when he gets out of prison. It's all good.
{104220}{104307}They're gonna throw him right back|in prison after he kills you.
{104490}{104537}You visualize the win.

{109433}{109502}-I'm doing this for both of us.|-Don't give me that crap.
{109504}{109539}You're doing this for you.

{109927}{109987}-Mia, what's going on?|-What?
{109989}{110049}-You know what I'm talking about.|-No, I don't.
{110051}{110129}You always have tears in your eyes|when Dom drives away?
{110132}{110169}What's the matter with you?
{110171}{110233}What's he racing off|in the middle of the night for?
{110235}{110311}-You know about the trucks?|-No, Brian! What trucks?
{110313}{110406}-Jesus Christ. What?|-Listen to me.

{111368}{111451}We're running out of time. Those truckers|aren't laying down anymore.
{111453}{111543}Maybe they'll make it through tonight,|but every law enforcement agency...
{111545}{111586}...is coming down on them.
{111588}{111658}If you don't want anything to happen|to them...
{111660}{111734}...you have to get in that car|with me right now and help me.
{111771}{111851}Mia, you are the only person|that can help me right now.
{111870}{111950}Please, Mia. Please help me.
{112236}{112304}Civics are stashed somewhere|outside of Thermal.
{112306}{112385}They wouldn't double back,|and Highway 10 is too well patrolled.
