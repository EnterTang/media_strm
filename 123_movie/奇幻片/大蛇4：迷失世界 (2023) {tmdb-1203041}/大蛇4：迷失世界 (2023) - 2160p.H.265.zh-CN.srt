1
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,389
Up you go.

2
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:32,389
Increase your rate of climb.

3
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:57,200
Our communication equipment's
been destroyed.

4
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:01,329
And if your radio and satellite phone
were in those trailers--

5
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:03,832
-They were.
-Then we're stuck here.

6
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,418
And stuck together, thanks to you people.

7
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:09,338
We came to watch.
You came to strip-mine the place.

8
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,757
-Back off.
-At least we came prepared.

9
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,636
Five years of work and electrified fence
couldn't prepare the other island.

10
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:21,016
-You think your Marlboro men will help?
-You're looters. You came to take.

11
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:22,267
You have no rights.

12
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:24,978
An extinct animal brought
back to life has no rights.

13
00:05:25,062 --> 00:05:28,357
It exists because we made it.
We patented it. We own it.

14
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:32,611
-You looking for a problem?
-And I found you, didn't l?

15
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:38,658
I know you.

16
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:41,578
You're that Earth First bastard.

17
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:44,081
-What's Earth First?
-Professional saboteurs.

18
00:05:44,206 --> 00:05:45,582
-Environmentalists!
-Criminals.

19
00:05:45,707 --> 00:05:47,417
Knock it off! Listen to me.

20
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:51,338
moving the baby to our camp may have
changed the adults' perceived territory.

21
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:52,631
Their what?

22
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:55,550
That's why they attacked the trailers.

23
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,221
-They're defending this entire area now.
-We have to move now.

24
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:03,684
To where? Our boat and their airlift
are waiting for orders we can't send.

25
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,606
There's a communications centre here
near the old operations building.

26
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:13,610
Everything ran on geothermal power.
It was never meant to need replenishing.

27
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:17,197
If we can get here,
we can send a radio call to the airlift.

28
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:20,409
-You know the frequency?
-Here in this book.

29
00:06:20,617 --> 00:06:23,120
-We'll mind those.
-How far is the village?

30
00:06:23,412 --> 00:06:25,163
A day's walk, maybe more.

31
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,211
-That's not the problem.
-What is?

32
00:06:32,587 --> 00:06:34,089
What is the problem?

33
00:06:35,048 --> 00:06:36,299
Velociraptors.

34
00:06:41,763 --> 00:06:46,101
Their nesting sites are
in the island's interior, which is why...

35
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:49,730
-...we were keeping to the outer rim.
-Wait. What's a Veloc--

36
00:06:49,813 --> 00:06:52,733
Velociraptor. Carnivore. Pack hunter.

37
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:55,569
Two meters tall, long snout...

38
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:59,823
...binocular vision, strong forearms,
killing claws on both feet.

39
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:04,786
The Rexes may track us, too,
if they feel we're a threat to their infant.

40
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:08,081
No, we'll lose them
once we leave their territory.

41
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:12,419
Don't bet on it. Tyrannosaur has the
largest proportional olfactory cavity...

42
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:15,339
...of any creature in fossil record,
except one.

43
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:20,469
The Turkey Vulture
could scent up to 10 miles.

44
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,098
Right. This is all very thrilling,
but I say we should head for the village.

45
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:27,559
We could head back down to the lagoon.

46
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:31,772
And sit out in the open,
near a heavily used water source...

47
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:35,359
-...hope that your captain comes back?
-He won't. He knows better.

48
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:39,321
Then we head for the village,
find shelter and call for help.

49
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,449
Rex just fed, so he won't stalk us for food.

50
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:45,577
Just fed? You mean Eddie?
Show some respect.

51
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:49,081
-He saved our lives by giving his.
-Then his troubles are over.

52
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:52,000
my point is predators don't hunt
when they're not hungry.

53
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:54,586
-No, only humans do.
-You're breaking our heart.

54
00:07:54,628 --> 00:07:57,172
Saddle up!
Let's get this moveable feast underway.

55
00:08:15,107 --> 00:08:16,566
Excuse me, cowboy.

56
00:08:18,068 --> 00:08:19,569
You want some gum?

57
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,659
You seem like you have common sense.
Why the hell are you here?

58
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:30,747
Somewhere on this island
is the greatest predator that ever lived.

59
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:33,667
The second greatest predator
must take him down.

60
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:36,712
-You going to use that?
-If he doesn't surrender, yes.

61
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:38,839
-Let me see it.
-No.

62
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:44,302
The animal exists for the first time
in tens of millions of years...

63
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:47,389
...and the only way you can express
yourself is to kill it.

64
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:50,517
Remember that chap about 20 years ago?
I forget his name.

65
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,687
Climbed Everest without any oxygen.
Came down nearly dead.

66
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:56,773
They asked him,
"Why did you go up there to die?"

67
00:08:56,982 --> 00:08:59,776
He said, "l didn't. I went up there to live."

68
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,869
I didn't wish you luck on your new venture.
You're off to a promising start.

69
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,830
my team is intact.
I'm sorry for the loss of your man.

70
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:16,293
It's easy to criticise someone
who generates an idea, assumes the risk.

71
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:19,421
When you try to sound like Hammond,
it comes off as a hustle.

72
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:22,758
It's not your fault.
They say talent skips a generation.

73
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:25,761
I'm sure your kids will be sharp as tacks.

74
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:29,139
Hammond's reach exceeded his grasp.
mine does not.

75
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:31,350
Taking dinosaurs off this island...

76
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:35,354
...is the worst idea in the long,
sad history of bad ideas.

77
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:37,981
And I'll be there when you learn that.

78
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:14,101
Take a break. Five minutes.

79
00:10:26,363 --> 00:10:27,739
Are you injured?

80
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:34,997
No, it's the baby's. I set its broken leg.
It won't dry in the humidity.

81
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,249
Roland, a word?

82
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:41,169
I'd love to know where we are.

83
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:48,468
making friends with Ahab?

84
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:06,153
Carter, I'm going to the ladies' room.

85
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:08,739
Wait for me here. Okay?

86
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:01,541
It's not polite to sneak up on people.

87
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:25,232
Carter! Where are you?

88
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:32,239
I got turned around in here.

89
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,742
Shit!

90
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:39,579
Carter, let me hear from you!

91
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:43,787
Okay, break's over. moving on!

92
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,213
Carry me.

93
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:25,829
Get off!

94
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:30,268
-When did you last see him?
-10, 15 minutes.

95
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:36,149
Come with me. And you.
If he's alive, we'll find him.

96
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:40,028
The rest of you go on.
You'll reach the ridge in 10 minutes.

97
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:41,738
Wait for us there.

98
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:46,994
No one tells the little girl.

99
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,419
Right. Let's carry on.

100
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,090
Everybody up.

101
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:03,468
Come on. Up, up.

102
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,848
All right guys, let's get the hell out of here.

103
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:01,109
Did you find him?

104
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:08,617
Just the parts they didn't like. map.

105
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:15,749
The operations building
is right down in there...

106
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,127
...about a mile and a half
from the base of these cliffs.

107
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:21,421
-How do you know that?
-I've seen it.

108
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:24,049
The climb down won't be easy.

109
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,886
We'll let them sleep one more hour.

110
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:30,806
Then we hit it.

111
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:41,061
What is that?

112
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:19,599
Stay down! Don't move!

113
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:21,059
Don't run!

114
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:31,778
Don't look, just run! Run!

115
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:48,128
Bastard!

116
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:28,311
You son of a bitch!

117
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:30,689
He can't reach you! Stay back!

118
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:34,443
He can't reach us!

119
00:23:46,496 --> 00:23:49,416
Oh, my God! A snake!

120
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,168
Stay back!

121
00:24:04,222 --> 00:24:05,349
It's okay.

122
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:07,851
It's coming back!

123
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:12,647
Dad!

124
00:24:14,816 --> 00:24:15,859
Thank you.

125
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:31,166
Don't go into the long grass!

126
00:24:36,838 --> 00:24:39,132
Not into the long grass!

127
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:43,697
Look at this.

128
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:46,408
-What is it?
-I think it's Ajay's bag.

129
00:26:02,758 --> 00:26:05,302
Go, as fast as you can.

130
00:26:06,928 --> 00:26:07,846
Go!

131
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,380
I see structures there.

132
00:26:42,547 --> 00:26:46,218
They said the communications centre
is in the operations building.

133
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:49,846
I'll get in there and send the radio call.
See you there.

134
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:51,807
-Wait for us.
-Every second counts.

135
00:26:51,848 --> 00:26:54,059
If you can keep up, you're welcome to try.

136
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:56,561
-Okay, here we come.
-No! Rest.

137
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:00,936
Damn it!

138
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:10,654
CQ, this is InGen Operations
Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.

139
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:13,824
Repeating, I'm calling
for InGen Harvest Leader...

140
00:29:13,991 --> 00:29:17,619
-...seeking InGen Harvest Base.
-Go ahead, Harvest Leader.

141
00:29:17,703 --> 00:29:20,288
The operation has suffered
severe casualties.

142
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,668
The survivors are now in mortal danger.
I need you to send rescue immediately.

143
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:27,379
Our co-ordinates here are...

144
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:31,842
...9?58' north, 85?...

145
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:07,479
Here, here!

146
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:10,482
Inside! Anywhere!

147
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:16,942
Go.

148
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,237
-Where do I go when I'm out?
-I'm right behind you--

149
00:33:47,222 --> 00:33:48,348
Look out!

150
00:33:52,144 --> 00:33:53,478
Up here!

151
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:19,796
Hey, you!

152
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:42,486
The school cut you from the team?

153
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:43,904
Get out of here!

154
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,821
Come on. Let's go!

155
00:36:10,657 --> 00:36:12,492
Let's go!

156
00:36:35,682 --> 00:36:39,019
-What about the other survivors?
-Another chopper's coming.

157
00:36:58,246 --> 00:36:59,831
It's okay. It's over.

158
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:05,128
That's one souvenir
they won't be taking with them.

159
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:15,847
Find the infant tyrannosaur.

160
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:19,142
Roland knows where the nest is.
I want it on my jet.

161
00:37:19,643 --> 00:37:22,771
I'll take it directly to the infirmary
in San Diego.

162
00:37:23,438 --> 00:37:26,942
Hurry. I want to be airborne
before the female knows.

163
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:36,618
You probably saved InGen.

164
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:39,287
We lost everything
we came after on this trip.

165
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:42,499
But this animal
and its infant will bail us out.

166
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:44,167
Congratulations.

167
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,420
You've got your trophy!

168
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:47,921
A buck.

169
00:37:48,797 --> 00:37:53,260
But it's alive! Everyone will line up
and appreciate it and what you did for us.

170
00:37:55,262 --> 00:37:56,722
What's the matter?

171
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:59,057
He didn't make it. Ajay.

172
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,601
I'm sorry.

173
00:38:02,686 --> 00:38:04,271
Really, I am.

174
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,319
I remember the people who help me.

175
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:13,238
There's a job for you in San Diego,
if you want it.

176
00:38:13,322 --> 00:38:14,573
No, thank you.

177
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,703
I've spent enough time
in the company of death.

178
00:38:33,592 --> 00:38:34,718
Oh, my God.

179
00:39:35,821 --> 00:39:38,448
Fifteen years ago,
John Hammond had a dream.

180
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,578
Like John himself, the dream was grand.
It was outsized. It was bold.

181
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:46,790
It was impractical. It was not to be.

182
00:39:47,499 --> 00:39:49,167
Half an hour from now...

183
00:39:49,376 --> 00:39:52,671
...John Hammond's dream,
re-imagined, will come true.

184
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,551
For .01 of the cost
of building a destination resort....

185
00:39:58,593 --> 00:40:00,429
Is this the Ludlow affair?

186
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,597
-This is private property.
-We're on the list.

187
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,266
Turn around, get back in your car.

188
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:08,020
-This is Dr. Harding, I'm Dr. Malcolm.
-We have Mr. Ludlow's test results.

189
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:09,896
There's good and bad news.

190
00:40:10,188 --> 00:40:12,858
Tonight we will christen
Jurassic Park, San Diego...

191
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:16,069
...a mega-attraction
that will drive turnstile numbers...

192
00:40:16,153 --> 00:40:18,613
...to rival any theme park in the world.

193
00:40:22,617 --> 00:40:26,747
I want to thank each one of you for coming
in these wee small hours of the morning.

194
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:30,751
-The ship is here.
-It's early?

195
00:40:32,169 --> 00:40:33,670
You better come now.

196
00:40:35,672 --> 00:40:37,090
It's so exciting!

197
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:41,636
-See that couple?
-Sir, you need to look at this.

198
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:43,513
Let them see this up close.

199
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:49,269
I need a direct line to the Coast Guard.

200
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:53,690
Look. That's their transponder signal,
Venture 5888.

201
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:57,611
-They're coming in, but I can't raise them.
-Try again.

202
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:02,908
Skipper, SS Venture, this is InGen
Harbour master. Do you copy? Over.

203
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:09,122
Skipper, SS Venture, you are approaching
the breakwater at flank speed.

204
00:41:09,247 --> 00:41:10,749
Reduce at once. Over.

205
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:27,933
SS Venture, reduce your speed at once.

206
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:32,479
SS Venture, this is InGen Harbour master.
You are entering a docking area.

207
00:41:33,313 --> 00:41:35,148
What's everybody looking at?

208
00:41:39,778 --> 00:41:41,446
We should've stayed in the car.

209
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:37,252
-You okay, Mr. Ludlow?
-I don't know. How do I look?

210
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,037
-Oh, my God.
-Where's the crew?

211
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:15,540
All over the place.

212
00:43:26,259 --> 00:43:27,761
I smell a fuel leak!

213
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:06,466
Check the cargo hold!

214
00:44:07,009 --> 00:44:10,470
-There may be crew down there.
-Everybody off the boat!

215
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,230
No! Get away from that!

216
00:44:54,097 --> 00:44:55,807
Now you're John Hammond.

217
00:45:26,171 --> 00:45:30,384
-Why wasn't it tranquillised?
-It was hit it with two darts of Carfentanil.

218
00:45:30,509 --> 00:45:32,969
-It was over 10 milligrams.
-That'd put it in a coma.

219
00:45:33,053 --> 00:45:35,889
It stopped breathing.
We gave it naltrexone to counteract.

220
00:45:35,972 --> 00:45:37,140
But we didn't know how much.

221
00:45:37,224 --> 00:45:39,851
You gave an antagonist
without knowing the dosage?

222
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:42,813
You put it in a narcoleptic state.
It's a locomotive now.

223
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:45,857
-We're prepared here.
-Any more dinosaurs on the boat?

224
00:45:45,899 --> 00:45:49,361
No, the infant was flown in.
We had this to tranquillise it.

225
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:55,951
Do you have the infant?

226
00:45:57,786 --> 00:45:58,912
It's safe.

227
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,086
The animal's dehydrated.
First, it'll go to a water source...

228
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:08,880
...then look for the next thing
its body needs.

229
00:46:09,047 --> 00:46:13,176
All the containment equipment is here.
We must get it back to the boat.

230
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:14,928
I know what you're gonna say.

231
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,556
When we brought the baby to the trailer,
it came.

232
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:21,059
There's no reason why it won't do
the same thing here.

233
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:27,232
Where's the infant?

234
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,487
In a secured facility. Why?

235
00:46:35,866 --> 00:46:37,409
Where's the facility?

236
00:48:02,202 --> 00:48:04,413
There's a dinosaur in our backyard.

237
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:12,921
Benjamin, what are you doing?

238
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,631
What are you doing?

239
00:48:15,507 --> 00:48:16,341
What?

240
00:48:17,676 --> 00:48:20,262
Come on. There's a dinosaur
in our backyard.

241
00:48:20,762 --> 00:48:23,348
The problem is, you need to read to him.

242
00:48:25,434 --> 00:48:28,103
If you serve him dinner,
he won't be up all night.

243
00:48:28,228 --> 00:48:29,938
It's the stupid fish tank!

244
00:48:30,022 --> 00:48:32,566
He needs a proper nightlight.

245
00:48:32,649 --> 00:48:35,819
-It may as well be daytime.
-Just turn it off.

246
00:48:57,549 --> 00:48:59,509
Slow down. Slow it down!

247
00:49:23,617 --> 00:49:24,826
There it is.

248
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:32,959
He's sedated.

249
00:49:35,128 --> 00:49:38,548
Really heavily. Give me a hand.

250
00:49:41,843 --> 00:49:46,056
When the adult sees us again
with his baby, isn't he going to be like:

251
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:47,182
"You!"

252
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,853
There may be some angry recognition.

253
00:49:53,438 --> 00:49:56,358
Who knows?
He may be just happy to see us.

254
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:59,152
What the hell are you doing?

255
00:50:00,821 --> 00:50:02,447
We're taking the kid.

256
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:06,118
If you really want to stop us, shoot us.

257
00:50:07,953 --> 00:50:11,039
-How will we find the adult?
-Follow the screams.

258
00:51:31,828 --> 00:51:33,747
-There.
-Oh, my God.

259
00:51:47,678 --> 00:51:48,762
It's too drugged.

260
00:51:48,887 --> 00:51:51,598
He won't know we have it
unless it makes some sound!

261
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,934
Wake up. Come on.

262
00:52:01,984 --> 00:52:03,068
He knows.

263
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:20,919
Ian, slow down a little.

264
00:52:23,046 --> 00:52:24,423
I don't think so.

265
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:48,196
This guy's almost fully awake.
You know where you're going?

266
00:52:49,323 --> 00:52:52,159
The waterfront's on the other side
of these warehouses.

267
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,370
-Is there a way through?
-There could be.

268
00:53:01,543 --> 00:53:02,711
There we go.

269
00:53:05,589 --> 00:53:07,382
You have to follow me now.

270
00:53:07,507 --> 00:53:08,759
There we go.

271
00:53:09,593 --> 00:53:11,178
-Got him?
-Yep.

272
00:53:12,971 --> 00:53:16,099
-Ready?
-Where's the Rex? Is it still behind us?

273
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:25,567
There's the water.

274
00:53:25,609 --> 00:53:28,278
Shoot it. Tell them to shoot it.

275
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:37,412
No, you idiot, the adult. Shoot the adult.
I want the baby back alive.

276
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,781
What have you done with it?
I want that infant!

277
00:54:44,563 --> 00:54:45,939
Are you there?

278
00:55:16,678 --> 00:55:18,096
There you are.

279
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:52,334
There's a first-rate shot
of the deck of the ship...

280
00:57:52,626 --> 00:57:55,337
...and the cargo hold that,
for the moment...

281
00:57:55,379 --> 00:57:59,549
...contains the animal itself,
presumably with the infant alongside.

282
00:58:00,092 --> 00:58:04,721
By our calculations, they are nearing
the halfway point of this trip.

283
00:58:04,846 --> 00:58:06,973
Jim, can you hear me there?

284
00:58:07,641 --> 00:58:10,727
Yes, I can, Bernard.
We are halfway to the island.

285
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:14,147
It is 206 nautical miles
from our present location.

286
00:58:14,189 --> 00:58:16,108
The ship is moving at 20 knots...

287
00:58:16,149 --> 00:58:19,486
...which will put it in at about 11:30 a.m.,
Eastern time.

288
00:58:19,569 --> 00:58:22,990
One of the Navy's primary concerns
has been safety.

289
00:58:23,198 --> 00:58:26,451
If we look at the ever-growing escort
around the ship...

290
00:58:26,618 --> 00:58:30,414
...they're taking no chances of a repeat
of the San Diego incident.

291
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,209
Let's take a moment to run the tape...

292
00:58:34,251 --> 00:58:37,337
...of our interview earlier today
with John Hammond.

293
00:58:37,462 --> 00:58:40,424
He's the former head
of InGen BioEngineering...

294
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:43,301
...the man who is now spearheading
this movement...

295
00:58:43,427 --> 00:58:46,096
...not only to return the animals
to their island...

296
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:48,807
...but to keep the island itself intact.

297
00:58:49,808 --> 00:58:52,936
It is absolutely imperative...

298
00:58:53,562 --> 00:58:57,858
...that we work with the Costa Rican
Department of Biological Preserves...

299
00:58:57,899 --> 00:59:00,068
...to establish a set of rules...

300
00:59:00,652 --> 00:59:04,531
...for the preservation and isolation
of that island.

301
00:59:05,949 --> 00:59:11,997
These creatures require our absence
to survive, not our help.

302
00:59:12,998 --> 00:59:16,168
And if we could only step aside...

303
00:59:18,003 --> 00:59:19,796
...and trust in nature...

304
00:59:20,881 --> 00:59:23,300
...life will find a way.

305
00:59:54,831 --> 00:59:56,958
