1
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:37,811
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.

2
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,147
Did you know him well?

3
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:41,982
I knew him.

4
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:46,070
<i>Well, nil nisi bonum.</i>

5
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:48,280
But did he really deserve...

6
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,783
...a place in here?

7
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:08,592
Lord Allenby, could you give
a few words about Lawrence?

8
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,844
What, more words?

9
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:14,515
The revolt in the desert...

10
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:18,394
...played a decisive part
in the Middle Eastern campaign.

11
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:21,397
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.

12
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:26,026
No, no. I didn't know him well,
you know.

13
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:32,241
Mr. Bentley, you know as much
about Lawrence as anybody.

14
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:35,202
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

15
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:38,080
And to make him known to the world.

16
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:42,710
He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.

17
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,044
Thank you.

18
00:04:44,211 --> 00:04:48,924
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

19
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:51,051
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:53,554
My name is Jackson Bentley.

21
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:57,933
I overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception.

22
00:04:58,225 --> 00:05:00,436
- He was a great man.
- Did you know him?

23
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:02,730
No, I can't claim to have known him.

24
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:05,399
I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

25
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:07,276
Knew him? I never knew him.

26
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:10,946
He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

27
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:32,301
Michael George Hartley...

28
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:35,888
...this is a nasty, dark little room.

29
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:37,139
That's right.

30
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:39,600
We are not happy in it.

31
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:43,687
I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark little trench.

32
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:47,316
- Then you're a big noble fellow.
- That's right.

33
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:52,529
Here is William Potter
with my newspaper.

34
00:05:52,946 --> 00:05:55,282
- Here you are, tosh.
- Thanks.

35
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:00,454
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

36
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:04,291
- Is it there?
- Of course.

37
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,126
Headlines.

38
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:09,838
But I bet it isn't mentioned
in the <i>Times.</i>

39
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:14,843
"Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."

40
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:19,473
I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.

41
00:06:19,723 --> 00:06:23,435
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

42
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,981
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes.

43
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,484
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.

44
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:40,828
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.

45
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:43,831
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

46
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,958
And you're balmy!

47
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:03,016
- It damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.

48
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:05,102
What's the trick, then?

49
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:09,398
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,609
By the way, if Captain Gibbon
should enquire for me...

51
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,196
...tell him I've gone
for a chat with the general.

52
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:20,117
- He's balmy.
- He's all right.

53
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,541
Lawrence.

54
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,543
Yes?

55
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:31,587
You're supposed to be...

56
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:34,381
Do you usually wear your cap
in the mess?

57
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:36,300
Always.

58
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,719
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?

59
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:41,388
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.

60
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:43,557
I'm going for a powwow
with the general.

61
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:47,269
I'm not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.

62
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:49,938
We don't want chaps in here
who should be on duty.

63
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,648
Where are you going?

64
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:56,403
I must say, Lawrence!

65
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:59,448
- Sorry.
- You're a clown, Lawrence.

66
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,076
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

67
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:06,747
Sorry.

68
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:09,583
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

69
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,045
I do not propose to let
an overweening, crass lieutenant...

70
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:16,757
...thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.

71
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:20,260
It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss, sir.

72
00:08:20,677 --> 00:08:23,931
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.

73
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,641
There is, indeed.

74
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,809
He's of no use here in Cairo.

75
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:31,146
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

76
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:32,940
Knows the books, you mean.

77
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:36,276
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

78
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:39,279
If Brighton thinks we should send
some arms, we will.

79
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,116
Well, what more do you want?

80
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:46,453
That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...

81
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:48,622
...giving military advice.

82
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,791
By God, I should hope not.

83
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:55,545
It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot to...

84
00:08:55,712 --> 00:08:56,797
To what?

85
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:59,508
To make our own appraisal
of the situation.

86
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:03,804
I'll tell you, it's my considered
opinion and that of my staff...

87
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:06,848
...that time spent on the Bedouin
will be time wasted.

88
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,476
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

89
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:12,604
They did attack Medina.

90
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:15,148
And the Turks made mincemeat
of them.

91
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,733
We don't know that.

92
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,488
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

93
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:26,159
In my opinion, this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow.

94
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:29,746
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.

95
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:32,833
Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.

96
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,502
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itself...

97
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:38,338
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

98
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:41,174
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

99
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:45,637
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

100
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:50,350
Does the bureau think they'll sit down
under us when this war is over?

101
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,522
The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.

102
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:58,400
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

103
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:01,361
- Lawrence, sir.
- Send him in.

104
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,448
Good morning, sir.

105
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:06,158
Salute.

106
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:11,705
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.

107
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:13,707
- It's my manner.
- Your what?

108
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:16,793
My manner. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't.

109
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,048
I can't make out whether you're
bad-mannered or just half-witted.

110
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:24,259
- I have the same problem, sir.
- Shut up.

111
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:27,888
The Arab Bureau thinks you
would be of use to them in Arabia.

112
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:29,806
Why, I can't imagine.

113
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:32,476
You can't perform
your present duties properly.

114
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:37,606
"I cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city."

115
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:40,067
- What?
- Themistocles, sir.

116
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:43,904
- A Greek philosopher.
- I know you've been well-educated.

117
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:46,406
It says so in your dossier.

118
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:51,745
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.

119
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:56,208
But I suppose I could be wrong.

120
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:59,586
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.

121
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:03,256
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!

122
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:06,593
Yes, what is it?

123
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:09,596
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

124
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,807
- Is that certain?
- Yes, sir.

125
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,102
There doesn't seem to be
any artillery.

126
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,105
But there must be artillery!

127
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:24,361
Sir, this is something
of an expedition.

128
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:28,782
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

129
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:31,618
He can't do that in six weeks.

130
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:34,955
- Two months, then.
- Three.

131
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:39,543
All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

132
00:11:39,793 --> 00:11:41,461
Thank you, sir.

133
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:47,300
I'd like to say, sir,
that I am grateful for this.

134
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,386
Shut up and get out.

135
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:56,852
Sir?

136
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:05,777
How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?

137
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:10,657
- How did you do it?
- Might better ask why I bothered to.

138
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:14,411
- Because I'm the man for the job.
- I just wonder about that.

139
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:17,539
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?

140
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,499
Find Prince Feisal.

141
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,585
Good. And when I've found him?

142
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:25,839
Find out what kind of a man he is.

143
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:29,843
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.

144
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,554
That is Colonel Brighton's business,
not yours.

145
00:12:32,846 --> 00:12:37,100
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.

146
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:41,897
That's new.

147
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,858
Where are they now?

148
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,944
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.

149
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:49,696
They're Hashemite Bedouins.

150
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:53,575
They can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day.

151
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,827
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

152
00:12:56,536 --> 00:13:00,248
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert:

153
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,044
Bedouins and gods,
and you're neither. Take it from me.

154
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:07,547
For ordinary men,
it's a burning fiery furnace.

155
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,551
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

156
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:18,642
It is recognised that you have
a funny sense of fun.

157
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:36,428
Here you may drink.

158
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,433
One cup.

159
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,817
You do not drink?

160
00:14:51,443 --> 00:14:52,485
No.

161
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:55,572
I'll drink when you do.

162
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:57,574
I am Bedu.

163
00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:02,198
Truly, now, you are a British officer?

164
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:03,825
Yes.

165
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:06,119
From Cairo?

166
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:07,996
Yes.

167
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:11,791
- You did not ride from Cairo?
- No.

168
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,962
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.

169
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:18,006
And before?

170
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:21,134
From Britain?

171
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:22,802
Yes.

172
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:25,513
Truly?

173
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:27,474
From Oxfordshire.

174
00:17:29,476 --> 00:17:30,977
Is that a desert country?

175
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:36,316
No. A fat country. Fat people.

176
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:39,110
You are not fat?

177
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:40,987
No.

178
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:44,115
I'm different.

179
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:13,520
Here...

180
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,772
...take it.

181
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:20,068
First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.

182
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,861
Take it now.

183
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:42,048
Bedu food.

184
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:58,731
Good.

185
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:00,233
More?

186
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:51,284
- Bedu.
- Where?

187
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:14,849
From here to Lord Feisal's camp
is Harith country.

188
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:16,309
Yes, I know.

189
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,478
- I am not Harith.
- No.

190
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:21,314
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.

191
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,020
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.

192
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:02,855
When you are ready to go...

193
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:06,192
...hit her on the shoulder
and say, "Hut-hut-hut."

194
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:27,463
Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.

195
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:48,067
I think we reach Masturah Well
tomorrow. Yes.

196
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:51,904
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.

197
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:53,281
NOW!

198
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,634
Good?

199
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,677
It's all right.

200
00:22:57,804 --> 00:23:00,014
This is a Harith well.

201
00:23:00,473 --> 00:23:02,975
The Harith are a dirty people.

202
00:24:24,557 --> 00:24:25,933
Turks?

203
00:24:52,418 --> 00:24:53,586
Bedu.

204
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:41,842
Who is he?

205
00:26:35,521 --> 00:26:37,148
He is dead.

206
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:39,025
Yes.

207
00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:41,360
Why?

208
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:45,698
This is my well.

209
00:26:47,283 --> 00:26:48,909
I have drunk from it.

210
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:51,662
You are welcome.

211
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:54,707
He was my friend.

212
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:57,752
- That?
- Yes, that.

213
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:11,098
- This pistol yours?
- No, his.

214
00:27:27,782 --> 00:27:29,075
His?

215
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,910
Mine.

216
00:27:31,577 --> 00:27:33,412
Then I will use it.

217
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:43,589
Your friend...

218
00:27:45,591 --> 00:27:47,802
...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.

219
00:27:48,094 --> 00:27:49,470
I know.

220
00:27:57,019 --> 00:27:58,312
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.

221
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:01,941
I have heard of you.

222
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:05,319
So...

223
00:28:07,655 --> 00:28:09,532
...what was a Hazimi doing here?

224
00:28:09,782 --> 00:28:13,285
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.

225
00:28:13,786 --> 00:28:17,248
- You've been sent from Cairo.
- Yes.

226
00:28:17,748 --> 00:28:21,168
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.

227
00:28:22,128 --> 00:28:24,505
I can both read and write.

228
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,263
My Lord Feisal already
has an Englishman.

229
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,306
What is your name?

230
00:28:35,266 --> 00:28:37,852
My name is for my friends.

231
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:45,401
None of my friends is a murderer.

232
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,363
You are angry, English.

233
00:28:58,164 --> 00:28:59,999
He was nothing.

234
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,042
The well is everything.

235
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:06,005
The Hazimi may not drink
at our wells.

236
00:29:06,297 --> 00:29:07,882
He knew that.

237
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:11,427
<i>Salaam.</i>

238
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:14,680
Sherif Ali.

239
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:18,100
So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...

240
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,853
...so long will they be
a little people...

241
00:29:21,103 --> 00:29:22,521
...a silly people-

242
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:27,193
Greedy, barbarous and cruel,
as you are.

243
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:42,374
Come.

244
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:45,044
I will take you to Feisal.

245
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:47,338
I do not want your company, sherif.

246
00:29:47,546 --> 00:29:50,883
Wadi Safra is another day from here.

247
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:54,220
You will not find it,
and you will die.

248
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,390
I Will find it With this.

249
00:30:06,982 --> 00:30:08,984
Good army compass.

250
00:30:09,568 --> 00:30:11,487
How if I take it?

251
00:30:11,904 --> 00:30:13,239
Then you would be a thief.

252
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:15,741
Have you no fear, English?

253
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:19,245
My fear is my concern.

254
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:21,080
Truly.

255
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:27,127
God be with you, English.

256
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:08,187
Hey, you!

257
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,708
- I've been waiting for you.
- Did you know I was coming?

258
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,211
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.

259
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:33,879
How did he know?

260
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:37,007
Not much happens within 50 miles
of Feisal that he doesn't know.

261
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:39,259
I'll give him that. No escort?

262
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,012
My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.

263
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:45,099
- Turks?
- No, an Arab.

264
00:32:45,391 --> 00:32:47,810
Bloody savages.

265
00:32:49,561 --> 00:32:52,648
- This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?
- Yes, they're over there.

266
00:32:52,898 --> 00:32:55,442
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?

267
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:59,738
Lawrence. I've been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.

268
00:33:02,408 --> 00:33:04,743
What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?

269
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:09,915
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.

270
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:14,545
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awful.

271
00:33:14,753 --> 00:33:17,923
Their morale, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...

272
00:33:18,132 --> 00:33:22,136
...the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.

273
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:24,763
They're fading away by dozens
every night.

274
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:26,640
What I want to say is this:

275
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:29,560
Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...

276
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:31,603
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.

277
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:35,607
When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.

278
00:33:35,774 --> 00:33:39,778
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I understand what you're saying.

279
00:33:39,945 --> 00:33:42,865
You'll make your appreciation
and get back to--

280
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:47,286
Oh, my God.

281
00:33:47,953 --> 00:33:49,788
Not again.

282
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,820
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.

283
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:25,199
"Move South," I've said.
"You're still in range."

284
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,662
They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!

285
00:34:57,189 --> 00:35:00,567
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

286
00:35:05,697 --> 00:35:07,157
Fire back at them.

287
00:36:19,146 --> 00:36:22,274
- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

288
00:36:22,524 --> 00:36:24,234
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

289
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:27,738
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.

290
00:36:27,946 --> 00:36:30,324
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

291
00:36:30,616 --> 00:36:33,452
You were right and I was wrong.

292
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:35,787
We must take some thought
for the wounded.

293
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:39,291
- We can take care of them at Yenbo.
- If they can get to Yenbo.

294
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:41,043
They can hardly come with us.

295
00:36:41,293 --> 00:36:45,631
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant...?

296
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:47,674
Lawrence.

297
00:36:47,966 --> 00:36:50,344
You understand,
Lieutenant Lawrence...

298
00:36:50,552 --> 00:36:55,641
...my people are unused to
explosives and machines.

299
00:36:56,183 --> 00:37:00,145
First the guns, and now this.

300
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:56,034
Cigarette?

301
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:57,703
I'm sorry.

302
00:38:08,422 --> 00:38:10,382
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

303
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:12,592
Umph off.

304
00:38:13,427 --> 00:38:16,263
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?

305
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:35,115
Hold it, Jenkins!

306
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:40,912
Jenkins!

307
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:51,923
Lawrence?

308
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:55,677
You have no servant.

309
00:38:55,927 --> 00:38:58,430
- I don't need a servant.
- No?

310
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,434
We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash clothes.

311
00:39:02,642 --> 00:39:04,644
- Yes, everything.
- I don't doubt it.

312
00:39:04,936 --> 00:39:07,981
- It will be very nice for you.
- I can't afford it.

313
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:35,509
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

314
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:39,471
God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...

315
00:39:40,347 --> 00:39:45,727
...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

316
00:39:47,062 --> 00:39:51,316
Others do battle in his cause.

317
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:55,862
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

318
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:59,324
And observe the prayers.

319
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:05,956
This will be best and richest
in the recompense.

320
00:40:07,082 --> 00:40:11,002
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

321
00:40:11,753 --> 00:40:16,842
Verily, God is forgiving, merciful--

322
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,510
Greetings, Ali.

323
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:20,512
- My lord.
- Sherif Ali.

324
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,975
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.

325
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:27,686
Yes, my lord.

326
00:40:30,188 --> 00:40:32,482
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

327
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:35,026
"By the noonday brightness...

328
00:40:35,235 --> 00:40:37,362
...and by the night
when it darkeneth...

329
00:40:37,612 --> 00:40:40,031
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

330
00:40:40,282 --> 00:40:42,701
...neither hath He been displeased.

331
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:47,247
And surely the future shall be better
for thee than the past."

332
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:51,042
"And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee...

333
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:53,545
...and thou be satisfied."

334
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:56,882
So?

335
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,051
Yes, colonel.

336
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:04,139
- I want a decision, sir.
- You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

337
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:07,058
Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.

338
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:11,229
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

339
00:41:11,438 --> 00:41:13,398
You could supply us through Aqaba!

340
00:41:13,815 --> 00:41:15,400
Aqaba!

341
00:41:16,234 --> 00:41:18,904
If you can get ahold of Aqaba,
we can supply you.

342
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,072
- But you can't!
- You could.

343
00:41:21,573 --> 00:41:24,159
You mean, the navy?

344
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:28,413
The Turks have 12-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.

345
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:30,624
Can you imagine what that means?

346
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:32,584
Yes, I can imagine.

347
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:37,047
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.

348
00:41:37,255 --> 00:41:39,758
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

349
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:44,179
The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.

350
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:46,264
You can see that, sir, surely.

351
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:49,434
I see that the canal is
an essential British interest.

352
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:51,645
It is of little consequence to us.

353
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:54,189
I must ask you not to speak like that.

354
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:57,108
British and Arab interests are
one and the same.

355
00:41:58,443 --> 00:42:00,111
Possibly.

356
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,074
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.

357
00:42:04,282 --> 00:42:06,952
Fall back on Yenbo and we will
give you equipment.

358
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:09,329
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

359
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:12,457
- Guns?
- A modern rifle for every man.

360
00:42:12,707 --> 00:42:15,627
No. Guns. Artillery.

361
00:42:15,835 --> 00:42:19,130
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.

362
00:42:19,297 --> 00:42:22,384
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

363
00:42:22,634 --> 00:42:26,304
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

364
00:42:26,596 --> 00:42:28,223
English will teach
Bedu to fight?

365
00:42:28,473 --> 00:42:32,602
We will teach them, Sherif Ali,
to fight a modern mechanised army.

366
00:42:34,229 --> 00:42:38,358
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?

367
00:42:42,195 --> 00:42:45,031
I think it is far from Damascus.

368
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:48,660
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.

369
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,871
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?

370
00:42:52,497 --> 00:42:53,873
Yes, my lord.

371
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:56,543
It is beautiful, is it not?

372
00:42:56,835 --> 00:42:58,503
- Very.
- That will do, Lawrence.

373
00:42:58,753 --> 00:43:02,841
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
but discipline will.

374
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:08,179
Look, Great Britain is a small
country, much smaller than yours.

375
00:43:08,388 --> 00:43:10,682
Small population compared with some.

376
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,060
It's small, but it's great. And why?

377
00:43:14,352 --> 00:43:17,188
- Because it has guns.
- Because it has discipline.

378
00:43:17,397 --> 00:43:19,691
Because it has a navy,
because of this...

379
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:21,568
...the English go
where they please...

380
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,404
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.

381
00:43:24,696 --> 00:43:26,781
- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

382
00:43:27,032 --> 00:43:29,284
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

383
00:43:29,534 --> 00:43:31,661
But I would like to hear his opinion.

384
00:43:32,078 --> 00:43:34,289
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?

385
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:37,959
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

386
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:43,465
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.

387
00:43:44,591 --> 00:43:48,261
My lord, I think...

388
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,389
I think your book is right.

389
00:43:51,723 --> 00:43:56,102
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.

390
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:58,396
On this ocean, the Bedu go
where they please...

391
00:43:58,563 --> 00:44:00,065
...and strike where they please.

392
00:44:00,315 --> 00:44:02,567
This is the way the Bedu has
always fought.

393
00:44:02,817 --> 00:44:05,737
You're famed through the world
for fighting this way.

394
00:44:05,987 --> 00:44:08,114
And this is the way you should
fight now.

395
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:09,949
I don't know.

396
00:44:10,241 --> 00:44:12,452
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

397
00:44:13,078 --> 00:44:17,415
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.

398
00:44:17,624 --> 00:44:19,793
- What is this to you?
- You're a traitor.

399
00:44:20,085 --> 00:44:22,087
No, colonel.

400
00:44:22,337 --> 00:44:25,590
He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.

401
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,927
They must say their say.

402
00:44:30,095 --> 00:44:35,100
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.

403
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:37,811
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.

404
00:44:38,103 --> 00:44:40,605
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

405
00:44:42,649 --> 00:44:44,609
You tread heavily...

406
00:44:45,652 --> 00:44:48,321
...but you speak the truth.

407
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:53,451
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

408
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:55,620
...it is late.

409
00:45:11,344 --> 00:45:13,847
Colonel Brighton means
to put my men...

410
00:45:14,013 --> 00:45:16,891
...under European officers,
does he not?

411
00:45:17,142 --> 00:45:19,018
In effect, my lord, yes.

412
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,312
And I must do it...

413
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:25,650
...because the Turks have
European guns.

414
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,570
But I fear to do it...

415
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:31,698
...upon my soul I do.

416
00:45:33,658 --> 00:45:37,829
The English have a great hunger for
desolate places.

417
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:41,207
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

418
00:45:41,499 --> 00:45:43,376
Then you must deny it to them.

419
00:45:43,668 --> 00:45:47,213
You are an Englishman.
Are you not loyal to England?

420
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,800
To England and to other things.

421
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:53,678
To England and Arabia both?

422
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:55,680
And is that possible?

423
00:46:02,437 --> 00:46:06,691
I think you are another of these
desert-loving English.

424
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,027
Doughty, Stanhope...

425
00:46:09,611 --> 00:46:11,946
...Gordon of Khartoum.

426
00:46:12,197 --> 00:46:14,449
No Arab loves the desert.

427
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:19,704
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

428
00:46:20,747 --> 00:46:23,208
And no man needs nothing.

429
00:46:26,336 --> 00:46:29,923
Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with...

430
00:46:30,215 --> 00:46:33,760
...because we are a little people,
a silly people...

431
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:38,223
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?

432
00:46:38,556 --> 00:46:41,851
Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...

433
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,562
...were two miles of lighting
in the streets...

434
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:46,481
...when London was a village.

435
00:46:46,731 --> 00:46:49,567
Yes, you were great.

436
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:51,903
Nine centuries ago.

437
00:46:52,153 --> 00:46:54,364
Time to be great again, my lord.

438
00:46:54,572 --> 00:46:57,867
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.

439
00:46:58,076 --> 00:47:01,871
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the English.

440
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:05,375
But my father is old...

441
00:47:06,376 --> 00:47:08,086
...and I...

442
00:47:09,754 --> 00:47:13,466
...I long for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.

443
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:18,263
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

444
00:47:19,597 --> 00:47:23,476
To be great again, it seems that we
need the English...

445
00:47:23,768 --> 00:47:24,769
---C)I"--.-...

446
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:26,437
Gr?

447
00:47:26,938 --> 00:47:30,608
What no man can provide,
Mr. Lawrence.

448
00:47:30,817 --> 00:47:33,278
We need a miracle.

449
00:50:38,588 --> 00:50:39,630
Aqaba.

450
00:50:43,134 --> 00:50:44,510
Aqaba.

451
00:50:45,344 --> 00:50:46,971
From the land.

452
00:50:47,972 --> 00:50:49,724
You are mad.

453
00:50:50,141 --> 00:50:54,520
To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nefud Desert.

454
00:50:54,729 --> 00:50:55,980
That's right.

455
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:58,483
The Nefud cannot be crossed.

456
00:50:58,691 --> 00:51:00,610
I'll cross it if you will.

457
00:51:00,818 --> 00:51:04,989
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.

458
00:51:05,198 --> 00:51:07,992
The Nefud is the worst place
God created.

459
00:51:08,242 --> 00:51:12,246
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.

460
00:51:12,663 --> 00:51:14,165
Fifty men?

461
00:51:14,415 --> 00:51:17,001
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

462
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,629
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...

463
00:51:19,837 --> 00:51:22,882
...they would be 50 men
other men might join.

464
00:51:23,674 --> 00:51:26,010
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

465
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:29,347
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.

466
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:31,849
- Good fighters, though.
- Good--

467
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:36,229
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

468
00:51:36,521 --> 00:51:40,650
<i>They face the sea, Shem A“,
and cannot be turned around.</i>

469
00:51:40,858 --> 00:51:44,570
From the landward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.

470
00:51:44,862 --> 00:51:49,867
With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.

471
00:51:50,076 --> 00:51:52,703
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.

472
00:51:56,165 --> 00:51:58,167
Aqaba's over there.

473
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:02,922
It's only a matter of going.

474
00:52:04,048 --> 00:52:06,384
You are mad.

475
00:52:13,558 --> 00:52:16,060
And where are you going, lieutenant?

476
00:52:17,395 --> 00:52:19,438
With 50 of my men.

477
00:52:21,065 --> 00:52:22,275
To work your miracle.

478
00:52:22,608 --> 00:52:26,904
Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.

479
00:52:27,613 --> 00:52:30,241
- Who told you?
- Ali did.

480
00:52:30,408 --> 00:52:32,118
Why not you?

481
00:52:33,744 --> 00:52:36,747
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?

482
00:52:36,998 --> 00:52:39,250
Yes, I must.

483
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,587
But I will spare these to you.

484
00:52:44,463 --> 00:52:47,592
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

485
00:52:48,217 --> 00:52:52,138
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance,
my lord.

486
00:52:53,097 --> 00:52:55,600
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.

487
00:52:55,808 --> 00:52:56,851
No.

488
00:53:08,738 --> 00:53:10,740
Since you do know...

489
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,785
...we can claim to arrive
in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

490
00:53:15,161 --> 00:53:18,456
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.

491
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:22,376
But in whose name do you ride?

492
00:55:50,941 --> 00:55:53,611
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

493
00:55:53,903 --> 00:55:56,113
They were here. I caught them.

494
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,200
Why are you here? Boy!

495
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:01,327
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

496
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:04,205
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.

497
00:56:04,455 --> 00:56:06,290
You have been tracking us.

498
00:56:06,957 --> 00:56:09,210
- You were told to stay.
- No, sherif.

499
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,504
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

500
00:56:11,796 --> 00:56:14,673
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.

501
00:56:14,965 --> 00:56:17,551
- It is the will of Allah.
- Blasphemy.

502
00:56:17,802 --> 00:56:19,053
Don't do that.

503
00:56:19,512 --> 00:56:24,225
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.

504
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:27,561
Be warned. They are not suitable.

505
00:56:27,812 --> 00:56:31,565
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.

506
00:56:33,192 --> 00:56:36,654
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

507
00:56:40,658 --> 00:56:43,494
One shilling, every week?

508
00:56:43,702 --> 00:56:45,329
That is fair.

509
00:56:45,996 --> 00:56:47,331
- Each?
- No.

510
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,166
- That is too much.
- All right.

511
00:56:57,758 --> 00:57:01,971
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.

512
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,611
There is the railway.

513
00:57:18,487 --> 00:57:21,407
And that is the desert.

514
00:57:22,867 --> 00:57:26,579
From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.

515
00:57:26,787 --> 00:57:30,082
For the camels, no water at all.

516
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:32,877
If the camels die...

517
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:35,546
...we die.

518
00:57:36,505 --> 00:57:39,300
And in 20 days they will start to die.

519
00:57:44,805 --> 00:57:48,058
There's no time to waste, then,
is there?

520
01:00:20,169 --> 01:00:21,879
I was thinking.

521
01:00:22,087 --> 01:00:23,797
You were drifting.

522
01:00:25,758 --> 01:00:29,428
Yes. It will not happen again.

523
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,390
Be warned, you were drifting.

524
01:00:34,058 --> 01:00:36,101
It will not happen again.

525
01:01:38,247 --> 01:01:40,124
That water is wasted.

526
01:01:45,546 --> 01:01:47,840
From now on,
we must travel by night...

527
01:01:48,132 --> 01:01:51,009
...and rest while it is
too hot to travel.

528
01:01:51,301 --> 01:01:53,679
A few hours each day.

529
01:01:55,514 --> 01:01:57,474
Why don't we start now?

530
01:01:57,641 --> 01:02:00,352
No. We will rest now.

531
01:02:02,187 --> 01:02:03,313
Three hours.

532
01:02:03,564 --> 01:02:04,982
Fine.

533
01:02:05,566 --> 01:02:07,025
I'll wake you.

534
01:04:25,539 --> 01:04:27,124
Do we rest here?

535
01:04:27,332 --> 01:04:30,502
There is no rest now short of water.

536
01:04:30,794 --> 01:04:32,796
The other side of that.

537
01:04:33,964 --> 01:04:36,133
And how much of that is there?

538
01:04:36,466 --> 01:04:38,010
I'm not sure.

539
01:04:39,136 --> 01:04:43,473
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.

540
01:04:44,558 --> 01:04:46,810
This is the sun's anvil.

541
01:06:19,403 --> 01:06:20,654
Have we done it?

542
01:06:20,904 --> 01:06:24,032
No, but we're off the anvil.

543
01:06:24,908 --> 01:06:26,451
Thank God for that anyway.

544
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,578
Yes, thank him.

545
01:06:28,829 --> 01:06:32,416
Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted him.

546
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:33,959
I know.

547
01:06:37,295 --> 01:06:38,797
We've done it.

548
01:06:39,089 --> 01:06:40,632
God willing.

549
01:06:42,759 --> 01:06:44,803
When do we reach the wells?

550
01:06:45,178 --> 01:06:48,348
God willing, midday.

551
01:06:48,849 --> 01:06:52,269
- Then we've done it.
- Thank him, Lawrence. Thank him.

552
01:06:55,939 --> 01:06:57,566
Gasim's.

553
01:07:01,445 --> 01:07:03,155
What's happened to him?

554
01:07:03,947 --> 01:07:05,449
God knows.

555
01:07:07,117 --> 01:07:08,994
Why don't you stop?

556
01:07:09,453 --> 01:07:12,956
For what? He will be dead by midday.

557
01:07:18,295 --> 01:07:20,088
We must go back.

558
01:07:20,297 --> 01:07:23,175
What for, to die with Gasim?

559
01:07:24,468 --> 01:07:26,720
In one hour comes the sun.

560
01:07:28,221 --> 01:07:32,893
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

561
01:07:33,143 --> 01:07:34,478
I can.

562
01:07:35,312 --> 01:07:36,980
Take the boys.

563
01:07:42,819 --> 01:07:45,322
If you go back, you kill yourself,
is all.

564
01:07:45,489 --> 01:07:47,824
Gasim you have killed already.

565
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:49,659
Get out of my way.

566
01:07:49,993 --> 01:07:53,830
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.

567
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:55,373
Nothing is written!

568
01:07:58,502 --> 01:07:59,920
Go back, then!

569
01:08:00,337 --> 01:08:03,673
What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?

570
01:08:04,674 --> 01:08:06,551
English blasphemer!

571
01:08:07,677 --> 01:08:09,262
Aqaba?

572
01:08:09,763 --> 01:08:11,556
Was it Aqaba?

573
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:15,143
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

574
01:08:17,187 --> 01:08:18,772
Go back, blasphemer...

575
01:08:19,356 --> 01:08:21,358
...but you will not be at Aqaba.

576
01:08:21,733 --> 01:08:23,443
I shall be at Aqaba.

577
01:08:23,693 --> 01:08:25,737
That is written.

578
01:08:26,363 --> 01:08:27,656
In here.

579
01:08:37,541 --> 01:08:39,292
English!

580
01:08:39,543 --> 01:08:41,211
English!

581
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:17,190
Lawrence! Daud!

582
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:27,737
Nothing is written.

583
01:17:59,936 --> 01:18:01,521
AI Lawrence.

584
01:18:05,942 --> 01:18:07,360
Farraj.

585
01:18:08,486 --> 01:18:09,654
Wash.

586
01:18:46,858 --> 01:18:48,568
AI Lawrence.

587
01:18:49,026 --> 01:18:53,656
Truly, for some men nothing is written
unless they write it.

588
01:18:58,327 --> 01:19:01,330
Not AI Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

589
01:19:01,539 --> 01:19:04,292
- AI Lawrence is better.
- True.

590
01:19:06,294 --> 01:19:08,880
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

591
01:19:15,219 --> 01:19:18,014
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

592
01:19:18,222 --> 01:19:21,017
- Is that a lord?
- A kind of lord.

593
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:24,103
Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.

594
01:19:24,353 --> 01:19:25,563
No.

595
01:19:27,732 --> 01:19:29,525
You have an elder brother.

596
01:19:29,692 --> 01:19:30,902
No.

597
01:19:31,068 --> 01:19:36,199
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.

598
01:19:37,742 --> 01:19:39,702
He didn't marry my mother.

599
01:19:41,204 --> 01:19:42,872
I see.

600
01:19:43,372 --> 01:19:44,749
I'm sorry.

601
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:50,630
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

602
01:19:53,216 --> 01:19:55,718
Yes, I suppose I am.

603
01:19:57,053 --> 01:19:58,763
AI Lawrence is best.

604
01:20:01,724 --> 01:20:05,853
All right, I'll settle for
AI Lawrence.

605
01:20:35,508 --> 01:20:38,594
They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.

606
01:20:51,274 --> 01:20:52,942
Very fine.

607
01:20:54,944 --> 01:20:59,031
- Great honour.
- The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

608
01:20:59,282 --> 01:21:01,701
- Is it permitted?
- Surely.

609
01:21:06,914 --> 01:21:11,961
He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan.

610
01:21:19,969 --> 01:21:23,222
They are good for riding. Try.

611
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:17,044
What are you doing, Englishman?

612
01:23:18,421 --> 01:23:19,964
As you see.

613
01:23:21,257 --> 01:23:22,299
Are you alone?

614
01:23:22,758 --> 01:23:24,343
Almost.

615
01:23:32,977 --> 01:23:35,438
Are you with those dogs
drinking at my well?

616
01:23:35,688 --> 01:23:37,106
Yours?

617
01:23:40,693 --> 01:23:42,486
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

618
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:47,116
I've heard of another man
of that name.

619
01:23:47,992 --> 01:23:49,702
Other? What other?

620
01:23:50,077 --> 01:23:54,290
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.

621
01:23:57,793 --> 01:23:59,962
He must be a great hero.

622
01:24:00,171 --> 01:24:01,881
He is.

623
01:24:02,131 --> 01:24:05,301
He wouldn't refuse water to men
coming out of Nefud Desert.

624
01:24:05,634 --> 01:24:07,720
Now, would he not?

625
01:24:10,306 --> 01:24:13,142
No, that must be some other man.

626
01:24:15,644 --> 01:24:17,521
Here is my help.

627
01:24:43,214 --> 01:24:45,883
Son, what fashion is this?

628
01:24:47,218 --> 01:24:50,888
- Harith, Father.
- What manner of Harith?

629
01:24:51,514 --> 01:24:52,848
A Beni Wejh sherif.

630
01:24:53,849 --> 01:24:55,351
And is he Harith?

631
01:24:55,559 --> 01:24:57,770
No, Father, English.

632
01:25:01,023 --> 01:25:02,358
Son...

633
01:25:03,192 --> 01:25:05,277
...they are stealing our water.

634
01:25:06,195 --> 01:25:08,030
Tell them we are coming.

635
01:25:08,781 --> 01:25:09,865
Tell them.

636
01:26:19,810 --> 01:26:21,478
- Empty that!
- Do not!

637
01:26:23,772 --> 01:26:25,941
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

638
01:26:26,734 --> 01:26:28,777
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.

639
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,253
Harith.

640
01:26:47,129 --> 01:26:48,297
Ali.

641
01:26:49,006 --> 01:26:51,258
Does your father still steal?

642
01:26:53,344 --> 01:26:54,553
No.

643
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,141
Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?

644
01:27:00,351 --> 01:27:03,520
No. There is no resemblance.

645
01:27:04,396 --> 01:27:06,815
Alas, you resemble your father.

646
01:27:07,274 --> 01:27:10,152
- Auda flatters me.
- You are easily flattered.

647
01:27:10,694 --> 01:27:13,155
I knew your father well.

648
01:27:13,572 --> 01:27:15,407
Did you know your own?

649
01:27:18,786 --> 01:27:23,499
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?

650
01:27:23,999 --> 01:27:27,086
Why, then you have a blood feud
with the Howeitat.

651
01:27:28,379 --> 01:27:31,423
- Do you desire it?
- Not the generals in Cairo...

652
01:27:31,924 --> 01:27:35,010
...nor the sultan himself desire that.

653
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:39,348
Call off your men.

654
01:27:44,895 --> 01:27:47,523
This honours the unworthy.

655
01:27:47,856 --> 01:27:49,942
I've only just begun to teach him.

656
01:27:50,192 --> 01:27:54,446
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?

657
01:27:54,697 --> 01:27:56,699
Be not clever with me, English.

658
01:27:58,409 --> 01:28:01,704
- Who is he?
- A friend of Prince Feisal's.

659
01:28:11,213 --> 01:28:14,383
- So you desire my hospitality?
- Yes.

660
01:28:14,591 --> 01:28:16,093
Is he your tongue?

661
01:28:16,844 --> 01:28:18,595
We do desire it.

662
01:28:21,765 --> 01:28:24,893
Then it is given, if you will take it.

663
01:28:26,395 --> 01:28:28,230
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

664
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:33,235
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.

665
01:28:33,986 --> 01:28:38,407
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the
Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.

666
01:28:39,658 --> 01:28:40,909
But...

667
01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:42,745
...dine with me.

668
01:28:44,121 --> 01:28:45,581
Dine with Auda, English.

669
01:28:46,415 --> 01:28:48,917
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

670
01:28:49,668 --> 01:28:54,423
It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

671
01:31:34,082 --> 01:31:37,753
This thing you work against Aqaba...

672
01:31:38,128 --> 01:31:40,547
...what profit do you hope from it?

673
01:31:40,756 --> 01:31:43,342
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

674
01:31:43,592 --> 01:31:45,677
The Harith do not work for profit.

675
01:31:46,845 --> 01:31:50,599
Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali...

676
01:31:51,099 --> 01:31:53,602
...he could find worse masters
than Feisal.

677
01:31:53,936 --> 01:31:56,772
But l...
I cannot serve.

678
01:31:57,648 --> 01:32:00,692
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

679
01:32:00,943 --> 01:32:02,945
Yes, it is my pleasure.

680
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:11,453
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

681
01:32:11,954 --> 01:32:12,955
No?

682
01:32:13,997 --> 01:32:16,667
- For the English, then?
- For the Arabs.

683
01:32:17,292 --> 01:32:18,710
The Arabs?

684
01:32:19,503 --> 01:32:23,799
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

685
01:32:24,007 --> 01:32:26,009
I have even heard of the Harith.

686
01:32:26,677 --> 01:32:28,178
But the Arabs?

687
01:32:28,637 --> 01:32:30,806
What tribe is that?

688
01:32:32,474 --> 01:32:36,645
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.

689
01:32:36,853 --> 01:32:38,897
Well, they are nothing to me.

690
01:32:39,147 --> 01:32:41,024
My tribe is the Howeitat.

691
01:32:41,233 --> 01:32:43,610
Who work only for profit.

692
01:32:43,819 --> 01:32:45,487
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

693
01:32:45,654 --> 01:32:48,323
And Auda's pleasure is
to serve the Turks.

694
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:49,658
Serve?

695
01:32:50,117 --> 01:32:51,159
I serve?

696
01:32:51,368 --> 01:32:54,037
It is the servant who takes money.

697
01:32:59,334 --> 01:33:01,044
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

698
01:33:01,336 --> 01:33:03,171
- Does Auda serve?
- No!

699
01:33:03,338 --> 01:33:06,508
- Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
- No!

700
01:33:11,179 --> 01:33:15,267
I carry <i>23</i> great wounds,
all got in battle.

701
01:33:15,726 --> 01:33:19,229
75 men have I killed with
my own hands, in battle.

702
01:33:19,438 --> 01:33:23,650
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.

703
01:33:23,859 --> 01:33:27,946
The Turks pay me a golden treasure,
yet I am poor!

704
01:33:28,196 --> 01:33:32,367
Because I am a river to my people.

705
01:33:41,043 --> 01:33:42,210
Is that service?

706
01:33:42,753 --> 01:33:44,046
No.

707
01:33:50,761 --> 01:33:54,264
And yet now it seems Auda
has grown old.

708
01:33:54,473 --> 01:33:57,225
And lost his taste for fighting.

709
01:33:57,392 --> 01:34:01,563
It is well you say it in my tent,
thou old tulip.

710
01:34:01,772 --> 01:34:05,567
Yet this is a tulip
that the Turks could not buy.

711
01:34:05,734 --> 01:34:07,569
Why should they wish to?

712
01:34:09,738 --> 01:34:10,781
Now...

713
01:34:11,406 --> 01:34:15,577
I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is...

714
01:34:15,786 --> 01:34:18,080
...a servant's wages.

715
01:34:18,246 --> 01:34:22,250
They pay me, month by month...

716
01:34:22,459 --> 01:34:26,588
...100 golden guineas.

717
01:34:27,756 --> 01:34:30,926
150, Auda.

718
01:34:31,134 --> 01:34:34,096
- Who told you that?
- I have long ears.

719
01:34:34,262 --> 01:34:36,598
And a long tongue between them.

720
01:34:36,765 --> 01:34:40,143
100, 150, what matters?
It's a trifle.

721
01:34:40,352 --> 01:34:44,147
A trifle which they take
from a great box they have.

722
01:34:44,356 --> 01:34:46,358
In Aqaba.

723
01:34:47,609 --> 01:34:50,320
- In Aqaba?
- Where else?

724
01:34:51,238 --> 01:34:54,116
You trouble me like women.

725
01:34:54,449 --> 01:34:57,619
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda will not come to Aqaba.

726
01:34:58,286 --> 01:34:59,454
- For money?
- No.

727
01:34:59,788 --> 01:35:00,956
- For Feisal?
- No!

728
01:35:01,164 --> 01:35:04,251
Nor to drive away the Turks.

729
01:35:05,001 --> 01:35:06,878
He will come...

730
01:35:07,796 --> 01:35:10,132
...because it is his pleasure.

731
01:35:12,134 --> 01:35:15,804
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

732
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:20,642
Make God your agent!

733
01:35:21,977 --> 01:35:24,146
Aqaba!

734
01:35:24,354 --> 01:35:26,022
Aqaba!

735
01:35:41,705 --> 01:35:43,707
God be with you.

736
01:35:46,668 --> 01:35:48,336
God be with you.

737
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:04,352
God be with you.

738
01:36:04,811 --> 01:36:06,855
God be with you.

739
01:39:02,405 --> 01:39:03,865
Yes.

740
01:39:04,199 --> 01:39:05,241
Aqaba.

741
01:39:06,868 --> 01:39:09,537
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

742
01:39:10,747 --> 01:39:13,708
- Do you think we shall?
- Yes.

743
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:16,628
If you are right about the guns.

744
01:39:44,572 --> 01:39:47,283
He killed. He dies.

745
01:39:48,034 --> 01:39:50,245
This is the end of Aqaba.

746
01:39:52,914 --> 01:39:54,749
One of our men
murdered Auda's man.

747
01:39:54,916 --> 01:39:55,917
Why?

748
01:39:56,126 --> 01:39:59,170
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.

749
01:39:59,629 --> 01:40:00,839
Ali!

750
01:40:01,256 --> 01:40:03,091
It is an ancient wound.

751
01:40:03,299 --> 01:40:06,261
I didn't come here to watch
a tribal bloodbath.

752
01:40:10,765 --> 01:40:12,934
It is the law, Lawrence.

753
01:40:13,101 --> 01:40:15,437
The law says the man must die.

754
01:40:16,354 --> 01:40:19,441
If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?

755
01:40:20,442 --> 01:40:21,693
Yes.

756
01:40:25,155 --> 01:40:26,781
Sherif Ali!

757
01:40:26,948 --> 01:40:29,951
If none of Lord Auda's men harms
any of yours...

758
01:40:30,326 --> 01:40:33,580
-...will that content the Harith?
- Yes.

759
01:40:39,711 --> 01:40:42,338
Then I will execute the law.

760
01:40:43,339 --> 01:40:45,467
I have no tribe.

761
01:40:46,718 --> 01:40:49,012
And no one is offended.

762
01:41:01,483 --> 01:41:02,484
Gasim.

763
01:41:06,988 --> 01:41:08,406
Did you do it?

764
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:37,018
Well, Lawrence...

765
01:41:44,526 --> 01:41:45,902
What ails the Englishman?

766
01:41:46,152 --> 01:41:49,572
That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nefud.

767
01:41:49,781 --> 01:41:51,783
It was written, then.

768
01:41:52,659 --> 01:41:54,661
Better to have left him.

769
01:41:58,289 --> 01:42:01,584
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.

770
01:42:02,043 --> 01:42:04,295
Besides, it was necessary.

771
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:07,590
You gave life and you took it.

772
01:42:08,174 --> 01:42:09,717
The writing is still yours.

773
01:42:46,921 --> 01:42:49,007
Auda Abu Tayi!

774
01:46:05,036 --> 01:46:07,288
The miracle is accomplished.

775
01:46:08,289 --> 01:46:09,916
Garlands for the conqueror.

776
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:34,190
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.

777
01:46:34,982 --> 01:46:36,692
I'm none of those things, Ali.

778
01:46:36,943 --> 01:46:39,570
- What, then?
- Don't know.

779
01:46:40,655 --> 01:46:41,948
Thanks.

780
01:46:43,491 --> 01:46:45,660
My God, I love this country.

781
01:46:47,328 --> 01:46:48,329
What!

782
01:46:49,372 --> 01:46:51,249
No gold in Aqaba!

783
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:55,002
Auda, I found it!

784
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:05,847
That's a pity.

785
01:47:09,392 --> 01:47:11,978
Ali, get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.

786
01:47:12,186 --> 01:47:14,689
Tell Feisal to find boats,
any boats...

787
01:47:14,856 --> 01:47:18,025
...and bring the Arab army here
to Aqaba, quickly.

788
01:47:18,234 --> 01:47:19,402
And you?

789
01:47:20,194 --> 01:47:22,738
I'm going to tell the generals...

790
01:47:23,197 --> 01:47:25,032
...in Cairo.

791
01:47:25,241 --> 01:47:27,577
Yes, cross Sinai.

792
01:47:27,869 --> 01:47:28,870
Come on!

793
01:47:29,203 --> 01:47:30,538
Sinai?

794
01:47:31,038 --> 01:47:32,373
Yes.

795
01:47:32,874 --> 01:47:36,544
- With these?
- They'll be all right with me.

796
01:47:41,799 --> 01:47:45,928
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:

797
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:49,056
"We've taken Aqaba,"
the generals would laugh.

798
01:47:49,807 --> 01:47:51,100
I see.

799
01:47:51,726 --> 01:47:54,896
In Cairo you will put off
these funny clothes.

800
01:47:55,062 --> 01:47:59,275
You'll wear trousers and tell stories
of our quaintness and barbarity...

801
01:47:59,901 --> 01:48:02,153
...and then they will believe you.

802
01:48:02,737 --> 01:48:04,906
You're an ignorant man.

803
01:48:24,926 --> 01:48:26,344
<i>Paper.</i>

804
01:48:27,261 --> 01:48:29,096
Papefl

805
01:48:31,807 --> 01:48:34,477
There is no gold in Aqaba.

806
01:48:35,603 --> 01:48:37,438
No gold.

807
01:48:38,814 --> 01:48:40,775
No great box!

808
01:48:44,946 --> 01:48:47,281
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?

809
01:48:47,823 --> 01:48:50,117
For my pleasure, as you said.

810
01:48:51,369 --> 01:48:53,871
But gold is honourable...

811
01:48:54,956 --> 01:48:57,625
...and Lawrence promised gold.

812
01:48:58,709 --> 01:48:59,877
Lawrence lied.

813
01:49:01,837 --> 01:49:03,297
See, Auda.

814
01:49:05,967 --> 01:49:08,094
"The Crown of England...

815
01:49:09,178 --> 01:49:11,639
...promises to pay...

816
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:17,019
...5000 golden guineas...

817
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:22,233
...to Auda Abu Tayi."

818
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:27,655
Signed in His Majesty's absence...

819
01:49:27,905 --> 01:49:29,323
"Dy..-

820
01:49:31,033 --> 01:49:32,243
...me.

821
01:49:33,327 --> 01:49:35,496
In 10 days...

822
01:49:36,205 --> 01:49:38,332
...I'll be back with the gold.

823
01:49:39,417 --> 01:49:44,171
With gold, with guns, with everything.

824
01:49:45,256 --> 01:49:46,841
Ten days.

825
01:49:48,134 --> 01:49:49,760
You'll cross Sinai?

826
01:49:50,052 --> 01:49:51,429
Why not?

827
01:49:52,179 --> 01:49:53,889
Moses did.

828
01:49:56,517 --> 01:49:58,728
And you will take the children?

829
01:50:00,021 --> 01:50:01,397
Moses did.

830
01:50:01,647 --> 01:50:03,357
Moses was a prophet...

831
01:50:03,858 --> 01:50:06,444
...and beloved of God.

832
01:50:11,741 --> 01:50:15,870
He said there was gold here.
He lied.

833
01:50:17,163 --> 01:50:20,041
He is not perfect.

834
01:50:30,092 --> 01:50:32,553
Lord, can we not rest?

835
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:35,890
I told you, no rest till
they know that I have Aqaba.

836
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:39,810
Have you two slept in beds?

837
01:50:40,061 --> 01:50:41,270
<i>F array?</i>

838
01:50:41,896 --> 01:50:43,189
Daud?

839
01:50:44,398 --> 01:50:46,067
With sheets?

840
01:50:47,985 --> 01:50:51,447
Tomorrow the finest sheets
in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.

841
01:50:51,697 --> 01:50:52,990
I promise.

842
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:55,910
Then it shall be so, lord.

843
01:51:17,264 --> 01:51:18,599
Look!

844
01:51:25,356 --> 01:51:26,941
Pillar of fire.

845
01:51:30,152 --> 01:51:32,154
No, lord. Dust.

846
01:52:21,787 --> 01:52:23,289
My compass.

847
01:52:25,082 --> 01:52:26,375
No matter.

848
01:52:26,834 --> 01:52:30,546
If we ride west,
we must strike the canal.

849
01:52:31,672 --> 01:52:33,048
Due west.

850
01:52:53,694 --> 01:52:55,196
Come on!

851
01:53:28,604 --> 01:53:31,232
Lawrence!

852
01:53:43,953 --> 01:53:45,246
<i>F array!</i>

853
01:53:55,506 --> 01:53:58,425
Farraj, don't! Don't!

854
01:53:59,468 --> 01:54:00,886
Don't!

855
01:55:36,357 --> 01:55:37,524
Why do you walk?

856
01:55:40,277 --> 01:55:42,196
But why, lord?

857
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:54,792
But why, lord?

858
01:55:55,042 --> 01:55:58,504
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.

859
01:56:24,238 --> 01:56:26,740
Lawrence, look!

860
01:57:35,642 --> 01:57:37,686
It's all right, Farraj.

861
01:57:37,895 --> 01:57:39,480
It's all right.

862
01:58:51,385 --> 01:58:53,262
Who are you?

863
01:58:55,389 --> 01:58:58,058
Who are you?

864
01:59:33,468 --> 01:59:36,096
- Daud!
- We're here, sir.

865
01:59:54,281 --> 01:59:55,824
You taking him in there?

866
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:58,327
Yes.

867
02:00:18,847 --> 02:00:20,265
Here!

868
02:00:22,184 --> 02:00:24,519
Here. You!

869
02:00:26,063 --> 02:00:29,566
And where the hell do you think
you're going to, Mustapha?

870
02:00:30,317 --> 02:00:31,818
We are thirsty.

871
02:00:33,654 --> 02:00:36,073
- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.

872
02:00:36,531 --> 02:00:39,660
- Are you going to the officers' bar?
- Yes.

873
02:00:40,869 --> 02:00:43,163
You can't take him in there, sir.

874
02:00:46,833 --> 02:00:49,378
What do you think you look like?

875
02:01:08,063 --> 02:01:09,690
No, no. You must go.

876
02:01:09,898 --> 02:01:11,525
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

877
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:16,113
Get out! You must get out! Get out!

878
02:01:17,739 --> 02:01:22,035
We want two large glasses
of lemonade.

879
02:01:22,244 --> 02:01:26,081
- This is a bar for British officers.
- We are not particular.

880
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:35,340
- Are you off your head?
- No. Oddly enough I'm not.

881
02:01:35,590 --> 02:01:39,219
- Just clear out of here, will you?
- Get that boy out of here.

882
02:01:39,553 --> 02:01:42,222
Corporal, we'll have
this one out anyway.

883
02:01:42,889 --> 02:01:45,434
- Get that wog out of here.
- Clear off.

884
02:01:47,561 --> 02:01:49,271
What's going on?

885
02:01:52,232 --> 02:01:56,153
- It's Lawrence, sir.
- Lemonade with ice.

886
02:01:57,487 --> 02:01:59,072
Explain yourself.

887
02:01:59,781 --> 02:02:01,575
We've taken Aqaba.

888
02:02:02,075 --> 02:02:04,745
- Taken Aqaba? Who has?
- We have.

889
02:02:04,995 --> 02:02:09,499
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.

890
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:11,585
We have.

891
02:02:13,378 --> 02:02:15,255
He likes your lemonade.

892
02:02:15,589 --> 02:02:17,507
You mean the Turks have gone?

893
02:02:17,799 --> 02:02:20,761
No, they're still there
but they've no boots.

894
02:02:21,261 --> 02:02:25,390
Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners. The entire garrison.

895
02:02:25,891 --> 02:02:28,101
That's not true. We killed some.

896
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:32,272
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.

897
02:02:33,607 --> 02:02:36,485
There's been a lot of killing
one way or another.

898
02:02:38,612 --> 02:02:42,115
Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.

899
02:02:42,324 --> 02:02:45,118
- It isn't possible.
- Yes, it is.

900
02:02:45,452 --> 02:02:47,287
I did it.

901
02:02:52,501 --> 02:02:54,169
You'd better talk to Allenby.

902
02:02:54,461 --> 02:02:57,214
- General Allenby?
- He's in command. Murray's gone.

903
02:02:57,464 --> 02:02:59,716
That's a step in the right direction.

904
02:03:00,467 --> 02:03:03,220
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.

905
02:03:03,512 --> 02:03:06,223
- Yes, of course.
- It's for him.

906
02:03:07,974 --> 02:03:10,852
Right. You want a bed yourself,
don't you?

907
02:03:11,144 --> 02:03:13,146
See Allenby first, though.

908
02:03:13,814 --> 02:03:15,440
Will he see me?

909
02:03:16,191 --> 02:03:17,692
I think so.

910
02:03:18,443 --> 02:03:19,986
Do that, then.

911
02:03:24,866 --> 02:03:27,494
- I'd better shave.
- Yes, you had.

912
02:03:27,702 --> 02:03:30,330
You'd better get into
some trousers too.

913
02:03:41,508 --> 02:03:43,343
"Undisciplined.

914
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:47,180
Unpunctual.

915
02:03:48,348 --> 02:03:50,267
Untidy.

916
02:03:52,102 --> 02:03:54,229
Several languages.

917
02:03:55,522 --> 02:03:57,524
Knowledge of music...

918
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:00,193
...literature.

919
02:04:01,236 --> 02:04:03,196
Knowledge of...

920
02:04:04,573 --> 02:04:06,366
Knowledge of..."

921
02:04:09,578 --> 02:04:12,539
You're an interesting man,
there's no doubt about it.

922
02:04:13,206 --> 02:04:16,293
- Who told you to take Aqaba?
- Nobody.

923
02:04:16,585 --> 02:04:19,254
- Sir.
- Sir.

924
02:04:19,546 --> 02:04:20,881
Then why did you?

925
02:04:21,047 --> 02:04:23,550
- Aqaba's important.
- Why is it important?

926
02:04:23,758 --> 02:04:26,303
- It's the Turkish route to the canal.
- Not anymore.

927
02:04:26,553 --> 02:04:30,724
- They're coming through Beersheba.
- I know, but we've gone to Gaza.

928
02:04:30,891 --> 02:04:35,520
- So?
- So that left Aqaba behind your right.

929
02:04:36,062 --> 02:04:37,105
True.

930
02:04:37,314 --> 02:04:41,943
And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.

931
02:04:42,819 --> 02:04:45,238
Am I going for Jerusalem?

932
02:04:45,572 --> 02:04:46,740
Yes.

933
02:04:49,075 --> 02:04:50,535
Very well.

934
02:04:50,744 --> 02:04:53,038
Aqaba behind my right.

935
02:04:53,246 --> 02:04:56,124
It threatened El' ArTsh and Gaza.

936
02:04:57,584 --> 02:04:58,835
Anything else?

937
02:04:59,085 --> 02:05:00,295
Yes.

938
02:05:00,587 --> 02:05:03,048
Aqaba's linked with Medina.

939
02:05:03,590 --> 02:05:06,593
Do you think we should shift them
out of Medina now?

940
02:05:06,843 --> 02:05:10,430
No. I think you should
leave them there.

941
02:05:10,597 --> 02:05:12,599
You acted without orders, you know.

942
02:05:13,308 --> 02:05:17,562
Shouldn't officers use
their initiative at all times?

943
02:05:17,771 --> 02:05:20,106
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.

944
02:05:20,315 --> 02:05:22,651
Yes, I know.

945
02:05:22,943 --> 02:05:24,486
Already?

946
02:05:24,778 --> 02:05:25,946
Yes.

947
02:05:27,697 --> 02:05:30,325
I'm promoting you major.

948
02:05:31,326 --> 02:05:33,620
I don't think that's a very good idea.

949
02:05:33,787 --> 02:05:36,873
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...

950
02:05:37,123 --> 02:05:40,794
...and carry on the good work.

951
02:05:41,294 --> 02:05:44,130
No. Thank you, sir.

952
02:05:44,631 --> 02:05:48,593
- Why not?
- Well, I, it's...

953
02:05:48,802 --> 02:05:50,136
Let me see now...

954
02:05:51,846 --> 02:05:55,600
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.

955
02:05:55,809 --> 02:05:58,019
One was a boy.

956
02:05:58,228 --> 02:05:59,688
That was...

957
02:06:01,314 --> 02:06:03,149
...yesterday.

958
02:06:03,358 --> 02:06:05,402
I led him into a quicksand.

959
02:06:05,652 --> 02:06:07,320
The other was a man.

960
02:06:07,654 --> 02:06:09,614
That was...

961
02:06:09,823 --> 02:06:12,242
...before Aqaba, anyway.

962
02:06:12,909 --> 02:06:15,620
I had to execute him with my pistol.

963
02:06:16,121 --> 02:06:19,165
There was something about it
I didn't like.

964
02:06:19,416 --> 02:06:22,544
- Well, naturally.
- No. Something else.

965
02:06:24,838 --> 02:06:27,173
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.

966
02:06:27,382 --> 02:06:29,509
No. Something else.

967
02:06:31,136 --> 02:06:32,721
What, then?

968
02:06:33,638 --> 02:06:36,016
I enjoyed it.

969
02:06:43,523 --> 02:06:47,027
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.

970
02:06:48,778 --> 02:06:52,407
What do you mean coming dressed
like that? Amateur theatricals?

971
02:06:52,657 --> 02:06:54,367
Yes. Entirely.

972
02:06:54,576 --> 02:06:57,704
Let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is.

973
02:06:58,038 --> 02:07:00,040
Fascinating gear they wear.

974
02:07:00,290 --> 02:07:02,542
How would I look in this, Harry?

975
02:07:02,751 --> 02:07:06,254
- Damn ridiculous, sir.
- Here, you keep it.

976
02:07:07,172 --> 02:07:11,259
What I'm trying to say
is I don't think I'm fit for it.

977
02:07:11,468 --> 02:07:14,387
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

978
02:07:15,388 --> 02:07:19,976
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said
it couldn't be done.

979
02:07:20,310 --> 02:07:23,313
- Brighton?
- I know what he thinks.

980
02:07:24,481 --> 02:07:27,817
I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

981
02:07:28,193 --> 02:07:31,071
I don't think it matters
what his motives were.

982
02:07:31,279 --> 02:07:34,407
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

983
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:37,827
- Mr. Perkins!
- Sir!

984
02:07:38,078 --> 02:07:40,705
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

985
02:07:44,751 --> 02:07:48,129
- You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
- Yes, sir.

986
02:07:48,338 --> 02:07:52,634
- What do you think about it?
- Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.

987
02:07:52,842 --> 02:07:55,929
- Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
- Sir!

988
02:08:01,601 --> 02:08:03,228
Come on, then.

989
02:08:06,815 --> 02:08:08,608
You're a clever man, sir.

990
02:08:08,942 --> 02:08:12,529
No, but I know a good thing
when I see one.

991
02:08:12,779 --> 02:08:15,490
That's fair, surely?

992
02:08:36,010 --> 02:08:41,141
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.

993
02:08:41,349 --> 02:08:43,643
- Bravo.
- You know better?

994
02:09:03,204 --> 02:09:06,040
I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

995
02:09:06,291 --> 02:09:08,668
We should do very well indeed,
shouldn't we?

996
02:09:45,246 --> 02:09:47,707
Easy, gentlemen, please.

997
02:09:48,875 --> 02:09:51,085
- Give us something to drink.
- Of course, sir.

998
02:09:51,586 --> 02:09:55,215
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

999
02:09:55,965 --> 02:09:57,133
Tracy.

1000
02:09:59,052 --> 02:10:00,887
Shall we go outside?

1001
02:10:12,065 --> 02:10:15,360
So you hold bound the Turkish
desert army?

1002
02:10:15,568 --> 02:10:16,611
Yes.

1003
02:10:16,861 --> 02:10:19,155
With 1000 Arabs?

1004
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:23,409
1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.

1005
02:10:23,576 --> 02:10:25,578
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

1006
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:27,789
It means 1000 camels.

1007
02:10:28,081 --> 02:10:32,377
That means 1000 packs of high
explosives and 1000 crack rifles.

1008
02:10:32,919 --> 02:10:36,673
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.

1009
02:10:37,257 --> 02:10:39,175
I'll smash his railways.

1010
02:10:39,425 --> 02:10:41,928
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

1011
02:10:42,178 --> 02:10:44,973
In 13 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.

1012
02:10:45,265 --> 02:10:47,600
You are going back, then?

1013
02:10:50,436 --> 02:10:51,688
Yes.

1014
02:10:52,105 --> 02:10:54,440
Of course I'm going back.

1015
02:10:58,778 --> 02:11:01,197
Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.

1016
02:11:01,447 --> 02:11:05,702
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits...

1017
02:11:05,952 --> 02:11:07,120
...he'll withdraw.

1018
02:11:07,287 --> 02:11:10,039
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

1019
02:11:10,290 --> 02:11:12,792
If he gets out now,
he'll never get back again.

1020
02:11:13,042 --> 02:11:15,545
- I wonder who will.
- No one will.

1021
02:11:16,170 --> 02:11:18,423
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

1022
02:11:24,429 --> 02:11:26,723
That's what I've told them anyway.

1023
02:11:27,181 --> 02:11:29,017
That's what they think.

1024
02:11:29,475 --> 02:11:32,729
- That's why they're fighting.
- Oh, surely.

1025
02:11:35,690 --> 02:11:37,984
They've only one suspicion.

1026
02:11:38,443 --> 02:11:42,822
That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

1027
02:11:43,031 --> 02:11:47,535
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1028
02:11:47,744 --> 02:11:48,828
Have we?

1029
02:11:49,329 --> 02:11:51,497
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1030
02:11:51,706 --> 02:11:54,834
Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?

1031
02:11:55,835 --> 02:11:58,087
Difficult question, sir.

1032
02:12:00,089 --> 02:12:03,885
I want to know, sir,
if I can tell them in your name...

1033
02:12:04,093 --> 02:12:07,513
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

1034
02:12:08,556 --> 02:12:10,058
Certainly.

1035
02:12:27,575 --> 02:12:31,037
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.

1036
02:12:31,245 --> 02:12:32,413
Right.

1037
02:12:32,705 --> 02:12:36,042
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.

1038
02:12:37,043 --> 02:12:40,421
- Instructors for the Lewis guns.
- Right.

1039
02:12:40,630 --> 02:12:42,215
More money.

1040
02:12:42,548 --> 02:12:45,718
- How much more?
-25,000 now. A lot more later.

1041
02:12:45,927 --> 02:12:48,638
- Dryden?
- It can be done, sir.

1042
02:12:48,888 --> 02:12:51,724
A couple of armoured cars.

1043
02:12:51,891 --> 02:12:53,267
Right.

1044
02:12:54,018 --> 02:12:55,561
Field artillery.

1045
02:12:57,730 --> 02:12:59,107
Right.

1046
02:13:02,068 --> 02:13:04,320
I'll give you every
blessed thing I can...

1047
02:13:04,570 --> 02:13:07,448
...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.

1048
02:13:07,657 --> 02:13:10,410
Thank you for your hospitality,
gentlemen.

1049
02:13:46,070 --> 02:13:47,947
Congratulations!

1050
02:13:58,207 --> 02:14:01,294
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?

1051
02:14:01,502 --> 02:14:03,337
I was wondering that, sir.

1052
02:14:03,588 --> 02:14:05,798
Might be difficult to get it back.

1053
02:14:06,007 --> 02:14:09,594
Give them artillery and you've made
them independent.

1054
02:14:09,802 --> 02:14:11,721
Then I can't give it to them, can I?

1055
02:14:11,971 --> 02:14:13,890
- For you to say.
- No, it's not.

1056
02:14:14,140 --> 02:14:16,893
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

1057
02:14:17,143 --> 02:14:19,103
Not like that poor devil.

1058
02:14:19,604 --> 02:14:21,147
He's riding the whirlwind.

1059
02:14:21,355 --> 02:14:23,608
Let's hope we're not.

1060
02:19:47,348 --> 02:19:50,601
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?

1061
02:19:51,143 --> 02:19:52,353
To Prince Feisal.

1062
02:19:52,603 --> 02:19:55,356
- You're not Prince Feisal?
- No.

1063
02:19:55,648 --> 02:19:56,982
You know him though?

1064
02:19:57,149 --> 02:20:00,653
He is my master. I am his servant.

1065
02:20:03,823 --> 02:20:05,157
Can you read?

1066
02:20:13,833 --> 02:20:18,337
Chicago Courier is my paper,
but my work is syndicated in America.

1067
02:20:18,587 --> 02:20:22,132
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.

1068
02:20:36,313 --> 02:20:37,481
Now...

1069
02:20:38,691 --> 02:20:42,653
- Where can I find Major Lawrence?
- Is that what you have come for?

1070
02:20:42,862 --> 02:20:44,989
Not altogether, sir, no.

1071
02:20:45,239 --> 02:20:49,618
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

1072
02:20:49,827 --> 02:20:52,913
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?

1073
02:20:53,205 --> 02:20:54,373
I don't know.

1074
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:57,710
- Last week they were near El Ghira.
- Ghira?

1075
02:20:57,918 --> 02:21:01,755
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

1076
02:21:02,715 --> 02:21:05,342
- I've never tried.
- Take a mule.

1077
02:21:05,885 --> 02:21:08,012
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.

1078
02:21:08,387 --> 02:21:11,015
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

1079
02:21:11,223 --> 02:21:12,516
They do.

1080
02:21:12,725 --> 02:21:15,895
But not so fast as we do,
you will find.

1081
02:21:16,228 --> 02:21:17,730
Myself...

1082
02:21:18,355 --> 02:21:20,232
...I am going to Cairo.

1083
02:21:20,441 --> 02:21:22,443
- As you know.
- Yes.

1084
02:21:22,693 --> 02:21:25,195
There's work for me there
of a different kind.

1085
02:21:25,738 --> 02:21:26,947
Yes.

1086
02:21:30,534 --> 02:21:32,912
I understand you've
been given no artillery.

1087
02:21:33,370 --> 02:21:35,915
- That is so.
- You're handicapped?

1088
02:21:36,081 --> 02:21:38,167
It restricts us to small things.

1089
02:21:38,375 --> 02:21:39,668
It's intended to.

1090
02:21:42,379 --> 02:21:43,964
Do you know General Allenby?

1091
02:21:44,965 --> 02:21:48,427
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.

1092
02:21:48,761 --> 02:21:51,430
- Excuse me?
- A clever man.

1093
02:21:51,722 --> 02:21:54,600
Slim customer. It's very good.

1094
02:21:54,892 --> 02:21:59,438
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.

1095
02:21:59,730 --> 02:22:03,233
Your Highness, we Americans were
once a colonial people.

1096
02:22:03,442 --> 02:22:05,819
We naturally feel
sympathetic to any people...

1097
02:22:06,070 --> 02:22:08,280
...who struggle for their freedom.

1098
02:22:08,447 --> 02:22:10,699
Very gratifying.

1099
02:22:13,452 --> 02:22:17,790
Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your story told.

1100
02:22:17,957 --> 02:22:20,292
I badly want a story to tell.

1101
02:22:20,501 --> 02:22:24,296
Ah, now you are talking turkey,
are you not?

1102
02:22:24,964 --> 02:22:27,800
I will give you a guide and a letter.

1103
02:22:28,008 --> 02:22:29,969
And before I leave here...

1104
02:22:30,260 --> 02:22:32,596
...which must be presently...

1105
02:22:32,805 --> 02:22:36,308
...I will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you.

1106
02:22:38,102 --> 02:22:41,355
You know that we are
destroying the Turkish railways.

1107
02:22:41,605 --> 02:22:42,731
I do, sir.

1108
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:45,859
Major Lawrence is in charge
of all this, is he?

1109
02:22:46,110 --> 02:22:48,612
My army is made up of tribes.

1110
02:22:48,821 --> 02:22:51,824
The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.

1111
02:22:51,991 --> 02:22:55,160
Your people do think very highly
of Major Lawrence?

1112
02:22:55,369 --> 02:22:58,455
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

1113
02:22:59,039 --> 02:23:02,376
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

1114
02:23:03,252 --> 02:23:06,672
...the man who gives victory
in battle is prized...

1115
02:23:06,839 --> 02:23:09,508
...beyond every other man.

1116
02:23:10,175 --> 02:23:13,345
One figure I can give you
from my head...

1117
02:23:13,512 --> 02:23:17,182
...because it never leaves my head.

1118
02:23:17,683 --> 02:23:21,770
Since starting this campaign
four months ago, we have lost...

1119
02:23:22,688 --> 02:23:25,149
...37 wounded...

1120
02:23:27,693 --> 02:23:31,030
...156 dead.

1121
02:23:32,573 --> 02:23:37,369
You remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded.

1122
02:23:37,578 --> 02:23:38,871
Yeah.

1123
02:23:39,204 --> 02:23:40,581
Four times as many.

1124
02:23:40,831 --> 02:23:45,544
That's because those too wounded
to bring away, we ourselves kill.

1125
02:23:45,794 --> 02:23:48,297
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1126
02:23:48,714 --> 02:23:52,384
- You mean...?
- We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1127
02:23:52,885 --> 02:23:56,305
In their eyes, we are not
soldiers but rebels.

1128
02:23:56,513 --> 02:24:01,018
Rebels, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code...

1129
02:24:01,226 --> 02:24:03,103
...and are treated harshly.

1130
02:24:03,812 --> 02:24:04,897
How harshly?

1131
02:24:05,189 --> 02:24:08,067
More harshly than I hope
you can imagine.

1132
02:24:08,859 --> 02:24:09,902
I see.

1133
02:24:10,069 --> 02:24:13,322
Our own prisoners are taken care of
until the British...

1134
02:24:13,530 --> 02:24:17,367
...can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.

1135
02:24:17,576 --> 02:24:21,622
- I should like you to notice that.
- Yes, sir.

1136
02:24:22,623 --> 02:24:25,250
Is that the influence
of Major Lawrence?

1137
02:24:25,709 --> 02:24:27,086
Why should you suppose?

1138
02:24:27,336 --> 02:24:29,755
It's just that I heard
in Cairo that...

1139
02:24:29,963 --> 02:24:32,424
...Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.

1140
02:24:32,633 --> 02:24:34,343
That is exactly so.

1141
02:24:34,551 --> 02:24:38,055
With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.

1142
02:24:38,388 --> 02:24:41,266
With me, it is merely good manners.

1143
02:24:41,433 --> 02:24:45,604
You may judge which motive
is the more reliable.

1144
02:24:46,230 --> 02:24:49,608
- And now, perhaps...
- Oh, sure, sure.

1145
02:24:53,737 --> 02:24:55,405
Thank you, sir.

1146
02:24:55,614 --> 02:24:57,366
Can you manage the letter--?

1147
02:24:57,616 --> 02:25:00,452
I'll do everything I have said...

1148
02:25:00,661 --> 02:25:04,248
...if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest...

1149
02:25:04,456 --> 02:25:06,875
...in my people and Major Lawrence.

1150
02:25:08,794 --> 02:25:11,922
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.

1151
02:25:12,131 --> 02:25:14,633
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.

1152
02:25:14,967 --> 02:25:15,968
Oh, no.

1153
02:25:16,260 --> 02:25:20,013
But influential men back home believe
it's time for America...

1154
02:25:20,264 --> 02:25:22,975
...to lend her weight to
the struggle against Germany.

1155
02:25:23,183 --> 02:25:25,185
And Turkey.

1156
02:25:25,477 --> 02:25:29,815
I've been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is...

1157
02:25:30,315 --> 02:25:32,776
- Enjoyable?
- Hardly that, sir.

1158
02:25:32,985 --> 02:25:35,988
But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

1159
02:25:36,196 --> 02:25:39,825
You look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.

1160
02:25:41,410 --> 02:25:43,203
All right. Yes.

1161
02:25:43,829 --> 02:25:45,497
Lawrence is your man.

1162
02:26:25,370 --> 02:26:26,371
Stop!

1163
02:26:45,766 --> 02:26:47,392
Stop it!

1164
02:26:48,227 --> 02:26:49,603
Stop it!

1165
02:26:57,778 --> 02:26:59,279
Come on, men!

1166
02:28:08,473 --> 02:28:09,808
Lawrence!

1167
02:28:30,495 --> 02:28:32,497
Good God! God!

1168
02:29:18,877 --> 02:29:23,673
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed
with a sword before.

1169
02:29:23,924 --> 02:29:26,176
Why don't you take a picture?

1170
02:29:26,551 --> 02:29:27,844
Wish I had.

1171
02:29:32,057 --> 02:29:34,267
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

1172
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:37,562
Am I in this?

1173
02:29:38,563 --> 02:29:40,273
Did you take his picture?

1174
02:29:40,524 --> 02:29:41,775
Yeah.

1175
02:29:46,196 --> 02:29:50,367
You are using up your nine lives
very quickly.

1176
02:29:52,869 --> 02:29:54,913
Charming company you keep.

1177
02:29:55,163 --> 02:29:56,415
Auda?

1178
02:29:57,207 --> 02:30:02,254
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue.

1179
02:30:02,587 --> 02:30:04,673
He thinks you're a kind of thief.

1180
02:30:04,923 --> 02:30:07,050
It's all right to take your picture?

1181
02:30:07,592 --> 02:30:09,094
- All right.
- Okay.

1182
02:30:09,302 --> 02:30:10,762
Just walk.

1183
02:31:10,989 --> 02:31:13,158
Major Lawrence!

1184
02:31:13,783 --> 02:31:16,495
Yes, sir, that's my baby.

1185
02:31:24,503 --> 02:31:27,130
This looting has got to stop!

1186
02:31:27,339 --> 02:31:28,673
It is customary.

1187
02:31:28,965 --> 02:31:32,511
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.

1188
02:31:32,802 --> 02:31:35,013
I would not say that to Auda.

1189
02:31:35,514 --> 02:31:38,308
- It is their payment, colonel.
- Payment.

1190
02:31:38,517 --> 02:31:41,311
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

1191
02:31:42,187 --> 02:31:45,524
- They don't go home when being paid.
- They are not free to.

1192
02:31:50,320 --> 02:31:54,407
Well, there's another lot you've
seen the last of.

1193
02:31:54,699 --> 02:31:56,326
They'll come back.

1194
02:31:57,160 --> 02:32:00,080
He says they'll come back.
Will they?

1195
02:32:00,372 --> 02:32:02,541
Not this year, Lawrence.

1196
02:32:03,291 --> 02:32:07,712
Look, Lawrence, how many men do
you think you'll have left? 200?

1197
02:32:07,921 --> 02:32:10,715
- Less.
- Well, then?

1198
02:32:11,049 --> 02:32:13,385
I said, they'll come back.

1199
02:32:14,094 --> 02:32:15,303
You badly hurt?

1200
02:32:16,846 --> 02:32:18,598
Not hurt at all.

1201
02:32:18,848 --> 02:32:23,019
Didn't you know? They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.

1202
02:32:38,743 --> 02:32:42,581
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.

1203
02:32:43,039 --> 02:32:46,585
- What are you learning from this?
- Politics.

1204
02:32:47,252 --> 02:32:51,756
You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

1205
02:32:52,424 --> 02:32:54,718
I will tell you that
when I have a country.

1206
02:32:56,970 --> 02:32:58,263
Did I answer well?

1207
02:32:58,638 --> 02:33:02,851
You answered without
saying anything. That's politics.

1208
02:33:04,102 --> 02:33:05,770
You learn quickly.

1209
02:33:07,105 --> 02:33:09,274
I have a good teacher.

1210
02:33:11,901 --> 02:33:13,278
Yeah.

1211
02:33:20,994 --> 02:33:22,871
- How's your hurt?
- Fine.

1212
02:33:23,079 --> 02:33:27,917
Before I return to the fleshpots,
which I shall be very glad to do...

1213
02:33:28,126 --> 02:33:31,171
...may I put two questions to you,
straight?

1214
02:33:31,463 --> 02:33:34,799
I'd be interested to hear you put
a question straight.

1215
02:33:35,008 --> 02:33:36,176
One.

1216
02:33:36,635 --> 02:33:40,597
What, in your opinion, do these people
hope to gain from this war?

1217
02:33:40,889 --> 02:33:43,308
They hope to gain their freedom.

1218
02:33:44,601 --> 02:33:45,644
Freedom.

1219
02:33:46,936 --> 02:33:49,773
"They hope to gain their freedom."

1220
02:33:49,981 --> 02:33:53,652
- There's one born every minute.
- They're going to get it.

1221
02:33:54,444 --> 02:33:56,655
I'm going to give it to them.

1222
02:33:58,323 --> 02:34:04,162
- The second question?
- Well, I was going to ask...

1223
02:34:04,663 --> 02:34:08,625
...what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert?

1224
02:34:10,627 --> 02:34:12,671
It's clean.

1225
02:34:15,507 --> 02:34:17,050
Well, now...

1226
02:34:17,926 --> 02:34:20,053
...that's a very illuminating answer.

1227
02:34:20,428 --> 02:34:22,055
May I...

1228
02:34:22,681 --> 02:34:25,183
...take one farewell picture?

1229
02:34:26,017 --> 02:34:29,062
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

1230
02:34:29,354 --> 02:34:32,315
One clock for two lamps.

1231
02:34:32,816 --> 02:34:34,025
A fair bargain.

1232
02:34:34,234 --> 02:34:36,861
Fair? I robbed him.

1233
02:34:48,331 --> 02:34:49,833
Trash.

1234
02:34:50,959 --> 02:34:53,378
I must find something honourable.

1235
02:34:53,670 --> 02:34:55,213
Honourable?

1236
02:34:55,839 --> 02:34:59,592
The year is running out, Brighton.

1237
02:35:04,013 --> 02:35:07,016
I must find something honourable.

1238
02:37:38,543 --> 02:37:40,712
Now you may blow up my train.

1239
02:37:41,004 --> 02:37:42,714
And what will you do now?

1240
02:37:42,922 --> 02:37:47,510
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.

1241
02:37:48,261 --> 02:37:50,263
They will carry my toys too, see?

1242
02:37:50,680 --> 02:37:53,725
Major Lawrence will campaign
this winter.

1243
02:37:54,017 --> 02:37:57,395
But you got what you wanted,
so you're going home, is that it?

1244
02:37:57,562 --> 02:38:02,233
Of course. When Lawrence has got
what he wants, he will go home.

1245
02:38:02,442 --> 02:38:05,028
When you've got what you want,
you will go home.

1246
02:38:05,236 --> 02:38:06,905
No, I shan't, Auda.

1247
02:38:07,697 --> 02:38:09,073
Then you are a fool.

1248
02:38:09,741 --> 02:38:12,744
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

1249
02:38:13,870 --> 02:38:16,080
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

1250
02:38:16,289 --> 02:38:19,417
...that when he made you a fool,
he gave you a fool's face.

1251
02:38:20,668 --> 02:38:22,754
You are an impudent rascal.

1252
02:38:24,255 --> 02:38:28,593
I must go, Lawrence, before I
soil myself with a fool's blood.

1253
02:38:38,978 --> 02:38:40,730
Like talking to a brick wall.

1254
02:38:49,405 --> 02:38:52,075
So what will you do now?
What can you do?

1255
02:38:52,742 --> 02:38:54,452
I'll go north.

1256
02:38:55,787 --> 02:38:57,622
That's what Allenby wants.

1257
02:38:57,830 --> 02:39:01,960
Allenby wanted the Arab army
behind Deraa.

1258
02:39:02,210 --> 02:39:04,462
Then that's where I'll take it.

1259
02:39:05,463 --> 02:39:10,301
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be
in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.

1260
02:39:10,593 --> 02:39:11,761
Won't we?

1261
02:39:44,252 --> 02:39:45,294
Train, Farraj.

1262
02:39:46,337 --> 02:39:47,839
Yeah, Lawrence.

1263
02:40:17,035 --> 02:40:18,870
Hide yourself, my friend.

1264
02:40:28,087 --> 02:40:29,547
Detonator.

1265
02:40:43,061 --> 02:40:44,729
All right, fetch another.

1266
02:40:44,937 --> 02:40:48,733
- Pardon, Lawrence. I put--
- Plenty of time. Fetch another.

1267
02:40:54,197 --> 02:40:55,573
<i>F array?</i>

1268
02:41:05,875 --> 02:41:08,920
- What happened?
- Detonator. A detonator!

1269
02:41:22,433 --> 02:41:24,936
He cannot ride, Lawrence. Look.

1270
02:41:34,445 --> 02:41:37,281
If they take him alive,
you know what they'll do to him.

1271
02:41:49,669 --> 02:41:52,130
Daud will be angry with you.

1272
02:41:53,131 --> 02:41:55,007
Salute him for me.

1273
02:42:14,819 --> 02:42:16,487
What will you do now?

1274
02:42:17,947 --> 02:42:19,448
Go north.

1275
02:42:19,657 --> 02:42:21,117
With twenty?

1276
02:42:21,993 --> 02:42:24,453
What would
you recommend me to do?

1277
02:42:26,164 --> 02:42:28,166
What would you recommend?

1278
02:42:33,171 --> 02:42:35,506
He hasn't 1/10 so many men, sir.

1279
02:42:35,673 --> 02:42:37,550
He's lied, in fact.

1280
02:42:38,926 --> 02:42:42,638
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have
done anything he hasn't done.

1281
02:42:42,847 --> 02:42:45,516
Then there is an Arab north army.

1282
02:42:47,018 --> 02:42:51,522
- No, sir, he has lied about that.
- Any idea Why?

1283
02:42:51,939 --> 02:42:55,943
- It's his army, I suppose.
- It's Prince Feisal's army.

1284
02:42:57,361 --> 02:42:59,864
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?

1285
02:43:01,199 --> 02:43:02,825
No.

1286
02:43:03,868 --> 02:43:07,580
He would if he could, I think.

1287
02:43:09,373 --> 02:43:12,835
- Not my line of country.
- It doesn't matter. Just curious.

1288
02:43:13,544 --> 02:43:15,755
What matters is I believed it.

1289
02:43:16,047 --> 02:43:17,715
The Turks believe it.

1290
02:43:18,007 --> 02:43:21,385
They are offering 20,000 pounds
for him.

1291
02:43:23,346 --> 02:43:25,097
Good heavens.

1292
02:43:25,556 --> 02:43:29,268
- Shouldn't say he had long to live.
- Whatever else, he's a brave man--

1293
02:43:29,518 --> 02:43:33,898
Surely, surely. If he's still going north
with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.

1294
02:43:35,066 --> 02:43:37,860
I wonder if they'd offer that much
for me.

1295
02:43:39,570 --> 02:43:43,699
What about next year?
Will they still come back?

1296
02:43:43,908 --> 02:43:45,910
I wouldn't be surprised.

1297
02:43:46,118 --> 02:43:49,747
- They think he's a kind of prophet.
- They do or he does?

1298
02:44:05,388 --> 02:44:07,932
- Now may I speak?
- Yes.

1299
02:44:08,599 --> 02:44:11,769
One more failure and you will find
yourself alone.

1300
02:44:13,145 --> 02:44:16,649
- I do not include myself.
- I do not include the others.

1301
02:44:16,941 --> 02:44:19,110
So say they love you.

1302
02:44:19,568 --> 02:44:22,071
The more reason to be thrifty
with them.

1303
02:44:22,280 --> 02:44:25,408
Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.

1304
02:44:25,616 --> 02:44:27,785
They must move mountains,
walk on water.

1305
02:44:28,035 --> 02:44:31,247
That's right. That's right.

1306
02:44:31,831 --> 02:44:34,333
Who are you to know
what can be done?

1307
02:44:34,792 --> 02:44:38,462
If we'd done what you thought could
be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.

1308
02:44:39,046 --> 02:44:43,467
Whatever I ask them to do can
be done. They know that if you don't.

1309
02:44:45,594 --> 02:44:48,556
Do you think I'm just anybody?

1310
02:44:49,056 --> 02:44:50,433
Do you?

1311
02:44:53,644 --> 02:44:56,981
My friends, who will walk on water
with me?

1312
02:45:00,443 --> 02:45:04,822
- Who will come with me into Deraa?
- Deraa is garrisoned.

1313
02:45:04,989 --> 02:45:07,116
Will you take 20 against 2000?

1314
02:45:07,325 --> 02:45:11,078
<i>- I'll</i> go by myself if I have to.
- Why?

1315
02:45:11,329 --> 02:45:13,164
Because I told the English generals...

1316
02:45:13,456 --> 02:45:17,084
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they'd be in Jerusalem.

1317
02:45:17,501 --> 02:45:19,628
Or perhaps you are here...

1318
02:45:20,212 --> 02:45:22,173
...for the English generals.

1319
02:45:24,216 --> 02:45:25,885
Who says this?

1320
02:45:26,177 --> 02:45:27,511
Rumour.

1321
02:45:28,846 --> 02:45:31,349
That is not an argument.

1322
02:45:31,599 --> 02:45:33,809
Oh, argument.

1323
02:45:34,018 --> 02:45:37,355
This afternoon I will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa...

1324
02:45:37,646 --> 02:45:40,024
...while the Arabs argue.

1325
02:45:41,984 --> 02:45:45,112
Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?

1326
02:45:45,488 --> 02:45:49,241
Yes. If one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes.

1327
02:45:58,501 --> 02:45:59,710
It's madness.

1328
02:46:03,214 --> 02:46:05,007
What are you looking for?

1329
02:46:05,216 --> 02:46:07,718
Some way to announce myself.

1330
02:46:07,927 --> 02:46:09,887
Be patient with him, God.

1331
02:46:23,275 --> 02:46:27,571
- Do you not see how they look at you?
- Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

1332
02:46:27,738 --> 02:46:29,073
Halt!

1333
02:46:29,281 --> 02:46:30,533
Walk on.

1334
02:46:30,741 --> 02:46:32,576
- Halt!
- Walk on.

1335
02:46:33,744 --> 02:46:35,913
You and you.

1336
02:48:17,056 --> 02:48:18,140
You.

1337
02:48:34,698 --> 02:48:36,700
You have blue eyes.

1338
02:48:37,576 --> 02:48:41,830
- I say you have blue eyes.
- Yes, effendi.

1339
02:48:42,039 --> 02:48:45,334
- Are you Circassian?
- Yes, effendi.

1340
02:48:46,210 --> 02:48:47,795
How old are you?

1341
02:48:48,045 --> 02:48:51,048
Twenty-seven, effendi.

1342
02:48:51,298 --> 02:48:53,175
I think.

1343
02:48:53,384 --> 02:48:57,930
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.

1344
02:48:59,223 --> 02:49:01,308
It's an interesting face.

1345
02:49:05,938 --> 02:49:08,399
I am surrounded by cattle.

1346
02:49:09,066 --> 02:49:12,736
He wouldn't know an interesting face
from a sow's belly.

1347
02:49:13,737 --> 02:49:17,741
I have been is Deraa now
for three and a half years.

1348
02:49:17,950 --> 02:49:22,371
If they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, I could not be more...

1349
02:49:22,580 --> 02:49:24,415
...isolated.

1350
02:49:26,333 --> 02:49:28,919
You haven't the least idea
what I'm talking about.

1351
02:49:29,211 --> 02:49:30,921
No, effendi.

1352
02:49:33,465 --> 02:49:34,883
Have you?

1353
02:49:36,093 --> 02:49:37,386
No.

1354
02:49:38,095 --> 02:49:39,930
That would be too...

1355
02:49:40,139 --> 02:49:41,765
...lucky.

1356
02:50:06,248 --> 02:50:08,000
Where did you get that?

1357
02:50:09,918 --> 02:50:14,089
- It's old, effendi.
- No, this is recent.

1358
02:50:16,133 --> 02:50:18,385
- You are a deserter.
- No, effendi.

1359
02:50:18,636 --> 02:50:20,512
Yes, you are a deserter.

1360
02:50:21,639 --> 02:50:23,891
But from which army?

1361
02:50:26,393 --> 02:50:28,646
Not that it matters at all.

1362
02:50:28,979 --> 02:50:31,315
A man cannot be always in uniform.

1363
02:50:42,826 --> 02:50:44,787
Your skin is very fair.

1364
02:51:03,681 --> 02:51:04,973
Beat him.

1365
02:52:39,526 --> 02:52:40,903
To me!

1366
02:54:43,400 --> 02:54:44,943
Sleep.

1367
02:54:46,737 --> 02:54:48,280
Sleep.

1368
02:55:00,083 --> 02:55:01,418
Eat.

1369
02:55:07,257 --> 02:55:08,550
Eat.

1370
02:55:12,387 --> 02:55:15,223
You have a body, like other men.

1371
02:55:23,732 --> 02:55:24,775
Good.

1372
02:55:25,943 --> 02:55:27,736
Then sleep.

1373
02:55:41,249 --> 02:55:42,501
Better?

1374
02:55:43,126 --> 02:55:45,837
Much better. You were right.

1375
02:55:46,129 --> 02:55:48,298
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

1376
02:55:49,257 --> 02:55:51,301
Oh, I've learned all right.

1377
02:55:57,099 --> 02:55:58,809
I'm going, Ali.

1378
02:55:59,851 --> 02:56:01,979
- Why?
- Why?

1379
02:56:03,271 --> 02:56:04,523
Heavens.

1380
02:56:04,815 --> 02:56:06,108
Why?

1381
02:56:06,984 --> 02:56:09,236
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.

1382
02:56:09,486 --> 02:56:11,488
And the end of the Arab revolt?

1383
02:56:11,780 --> 02:56:14,866
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.

1384
02:56:15,158 --> 02:56:18,161
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.

1385
02:56:18,453 --> 02:56:21,456
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

1386
02:56:21,665 --> 02:56:23,625
You proved it.

1387
02:56:23,834 --> 02:56:26,003
Look, Ali. Look.

1388
02:56:26,294 --> 02:56:30,048
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.

1389
02:56:30,841 --> 02:56:33,176
And there's nothing I can do about it.

1390
02:56:33,343 --> 02:56:36,013
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.

1391
02:56:37,806 --> 02:56:39,266
He can...

1392
02:56:39,474 --> 02:56:42,352
...but he can't want what he wants.

1393
02:56:43,311 --> 02:56:46,523
This is the stuff that decides what
he wants.

1394
02:56:49,359 --> 02:56:53,155
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.

1395
02:56:53,363 --> 02:56:57,325
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.

1396
02:56:57,534 --> 02:57:00,328
- I tried to.
- So would any man.

1397
02:57:00,537 --> 02:57:04,041
Well, any man is what I am.

1398
02:57:05,042 --> 02:57:09,046
And I'm going back to Allenby to
ask him for a job...

1399
02:57:09,337 --> 02:57:11,381
...that any man can do.

1400
02:57:11,673 --> 02:57:13,550
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

1401
02:57:13,842 --> 02:57:16,553
<i>- I'll</i> make easy stages.
- You?

1402
02:57:18,096 --> 02:57:21,558
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1403
02:57:23,351 --> 02:57:27,898
Look, Ali, I think I see
a way of being just...

1404
02:57:28,106 --> 02:57:29,733
...ordinarily...

1405
02:57:30,400 --> 02:57:31,818
...happy

1406
02:57:35,614 --> 02:57:37,240
Can I take this?

1407
02:57:37,866 --> 02:57:39,743
It is not clean.

1408
02:57:40,035 --> 02:57:43,080
No, but it's warm.

1409
02:57:43,455 --> 02:57:44,748
And these...

1410
02:57:44,956 --> 02:57:48,919
...having led them here,
have you no care for them?

1411
02:57:50,420 --> 02:57:55,592
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

1412
02:57:57,844 --> 02:58:00,055
And let me go back to mine.

1413
02:58:29,167 --> 02:58:32,295
- I say, don't forget those form fives.
- All right.

1414
02:58:38,135 --> 02:58:39,970
Mind if I join you?

1415
02:58:40,804 --> 02:58:42,472
Honoured, sir.

1416
02:58:44,808 --> 02:58:48,145
- Good to be back.
- We heard you were, sir.

1417
02:58:48,687 --> 02:58:51,273
- What's doing out there?
- Where?

1418
02:58:51,481 --> 02:58:53,775
- Arabia?
- Well, yes, sir.

1419
02:58:53,984 --> 02:58:57,320
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?

1420
02:58:57,612 --> 02:58:59,990
We're settling in.
We built a squash court.

1421
02:59:00,198 --> 02:59:01,658
Jolly good.

1422
02:59:02,492 --> 02:59:06,496
Well, I have to go up there.

1423
02:59:07,497 --> 02:59:09,958
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

1424
02:59:10,167 --> 02:59:11,918
Bloody wogs.

1425
02:59:13,336 --> 02:59:15,213
Yes, probably.

1426
02:59:15,964 --> 02:59:18,341
Jolly good about the squash court.

1427
02:59:21,052 --> 02:59:23,555
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

1428
02:59:36,818 --> 02:59:38,069
Morning.

1429
02:59:38,236 --> 02:59:40,030
- Good morning, sir.
- Good to be back.

1430
02:59:40,322 --> 02:59:43,366
- I'll believe you, sir.
- No, really it is.

1431
02:59:46,661 --> 02:59:47,996
Hello.

1432
02:59:48,580 --> 02:59:51,708
Morning. You're to go right in.

1433
03:00:03,720 --> 03:00:05,222
Lawrence.

1434
03:00:07,015 --> 03:00:09,559
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1435
03:00:10,227 --> 03:00:11,603
Sir.

1436
03:00:17,400 --> 03:00:19,236
Well, general, I will leave you.

1437
03:00:19,527 --> 03:00:22,405
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make...

1438
03:00:22,697 --> 03:00:26,493
...about my people
and their weakness...

1439
03:00:26,743 --> 03:00:31,539
...and the need to keep them weak
in the British interest.

1440
03:00:34,042 --> 03:00:37,587
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.

1441
03:00:37,754 --> 03:00:39,798
I told you, sir, no such treaty exists.

1442
03:00:40,090 --> 03:00:44,552
Yes, general, you have lied
most bravely, but not convincingly.

1443
03:00:44,761 --> 03:00:46,763
I know this treaty does exist.

1444
03:00:47,013 --> 03:00:48,932
Treaty, sir?

1445
03:00:51,101 --> 03:00:53,103
He does it better than you, general.

1446
03:00:53,395 --> 03:00:56,648
But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.

1447
03:01:10,829 --> 03:01:12,455
You really don't know?

1448
03:01:14,791 --> 03:01:16,793
Then what the devil's this?

1449
03:01:17,794 --> 03:01:21,673
It's my request
for release from Arabia, sir.

1450
03:01:21,923 --> 03:01:23,300
For what reason?

1451
03:01:23,466 --> 03:01:25,802
You sure you haven't heard
of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1452
03:01:25,969 --> 03:01:27,345
No.

1453
03:01:28,138 --> 03:01:31,308
- I can guess.
- Don't guess. Tell him.

1454
03:01:33,101 --> 03:01:34,477
Well, now...

1455
03:01:34,936 --> 03:01:37,981
Mr. Sykes is an English civil servant.

1456
03:01:38,189 --> 03:01:41,318
Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

1457
03:01:41,484 --> 03:01:45,697
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war...

1458
03:01:45,989 --> 03:01:49,326
...France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

1459
03:01:49,617 --> 03:01:51,328
Including Arabia.

1460
03:01:51,619 --> 03:01:55,665
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

1461
03:01:55,874 --> 03:01:59,002
An agreement to that effect.

1462
03:01:59,669 --> 03:02:03,214
There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

1463
03:02:03,506 --> 03:02:06,217
And let's have
no displays of indignation.

1464
03:02:06,509 --> 03:02:09,637
You may not have known,
but you certainly had suspicions.

1465
03:02:10,138 --> 03:02:13,475
If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.

1466
03:02:13,683 --> 03:02:18,146
And a man who tells lies, like me,
merely hides the truth.

1467
03:02:18,355 --> 03:02:23,109
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

1468
03:02:23,693 --> 03:02:26,988
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.

1469
03:02:27,489 --> 03:02:29,866
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1470
03:02:31,368 --> 03:02:33,370
And I want an ordinary job, sir.

1471
03:02:33,620 --> 03:02:35,914
That's my reason for resigning.

1472
03:02:37,207 --> 03:02:38,875
It's personal.

1473
03:02:39,042 --> 03:02:41,252
- Personal?
- Yes, sir.

1474
03:02:41,544 --> 03:02:44,631
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.

1475
03:02:44,881 --> 03:02:48,218
And as it happens, a damned
important one. Are you mad?

1476
03:02:48,510 --> 03:02:51,721
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

1477
03:02:51,930 --> 03:02:54,015
That's my reason too.

1478
03:02:54,182 --> 03:02:59,229
Look, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 16th of next month...

1479
03:02:59,396 --> 03:03:01,398
...and you are part of it.

1480
03:03:01,898 --> 03:03:05,568
Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!

1481
03:03:05,777 --> 03:03:09,697
I don't want to be part
of your big push!

1482
03:03:10,407 --> 03:03:12,450
What about your Arab friends?

1483
03:03:12,700 --> 03:03:16,538
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!

1484
03:03:16,746 --> 03:03:18,915
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

1485
03:03:19,165 --> 03:03:24,254
I've told you, I just want
my ration of common humanity.

1486
03:03:24,546 --> 03:03:27,424
- Lawrence.
- Yes?

1487
03:03:30,176 --> 03:03:32,929
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

1488
03:03:33,179 --> 03:03:35,265
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1489
03:03:35,557 --> 03:03:37,267
Thank you, sir.

1490
03:03:38,309 --> 03:03:40,562
Why don't we...?

1491
03:03:43,106 --> 03:03:44,941
There's blood on your back.

1492
03:03:46,234 --> 03:03:49,320
- Do you want a doctor?
- No.

1493
03:03:50,488 --> 03:03:52,699
Tell me what happened.

1494
03:03:57,620 --> 03:03:59,789
Say, what goes on in there?

1495
03:04:00,582 --> 03:04:02,459
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on!

1496
03:04:02,709 --> 03:04:06,129
- No, really. Nothing at all.
-ls the man in trouble?

1497
03:04:06,337 --> 03:04:10,300
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

1498
03:04:10,592 --> 03:04:14,471
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.

1499
03:04:14,721 --> 03:04:18,141
- What claim?
- I've made that boy a hero.

1500
03:04:18,349 --> 03:04:21,102
When the war's over,
he can be anything he wants.

1501
03:04:21,311 --> 03:04:25,648
Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.

1502
03:04:26,149 --> 03:04:28,985
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

1503
03:04:29,527 --> 03:04:31,988
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

1504
03:04:32,280 --> 03:04:35,033
Always walking away, aren't you?

1505
03:04:35,325 --> 03:04:36,826
Well, I'll tell you.

1506
03:04:37,035 --> 03:04:39,996
It's a clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

1507
03:04:40,246 --> 03:04:43,166
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...

1508
03:04:43,374 --> 03:04:46,169
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

1509
03:04:47,003 --> 03:04:50,006
I believe your name will
be a household word...

1510
03:04:50,507 --> 03:04:54,177
...when you'd have to go to the
war museum to find who Allenby was.

1511
03:04:55,053 --> 03:04:57,972
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.

1512
03:04:58,556 --> 03:05:00,058
Leave me alone.

1513
03:05:00,350 --> 03:05:02,852
- Leave me alone.
- That's a feeble thing to say.

1514
03:05:03,061 --> 03:05:05,688
- I know I'm not ordinary.
- That's not what I'm saying.

1515
03:05:05,897 --> 03:05:08,691
All right, I'm extraordinary.

1516
03:05:10,693 --> 03:05:11,778
What of it'?

1517
03:05:12,153 --> 03:05:14,864
Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.

1518
03:05:15,031 --> 03:05:18,201
It's a terrible thing
for a man to flunk it if he has.

1519
03:05:18,368 --> 03:05:20,537
Are you speaking from experience?

1520
03:05:20,828 --> 03:05:22,205
No.

1521
03:05:22,372 --> 03:05:24,207
You're guessing, then.

1522
03:05:25,375 --> 03:05:26,709
Suppose you're wrong.

1523
03:05:27,001 --> 03:05:30,046
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

1524
03:05:30,880 --> 03:05:33,841
- Yes. I said, yes.
- After all--

1525
03:05:36,386 --> 03:05:38,429
- The 16th?
- Can you do it?

1526
03:05:38,596 --> 03:05:40,723
I'll give you a lot of money.

1527
03:05:41,015 --> 03:05:43,851
- Artillery?
- I can't.

1528
03:05:45,061 --> 03:05:48,022
They won't be coming for money,
not the best of them.

1529
03:05:48,314 --> 03:05:50,525
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1530
03:05:51,568 --> 03:05:53,611
Which I'm going to give them.

1531
03:05:54,362 --> 03:05:56,114
That's all I want.

1532
03:05:57,198 --> 03:06:00,076
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

1533
03:06:00,326 --> 03:06:04,581
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

1534
03:06:04,872 --> 03:06:08,042
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.

1535
03:06:08,251 --> 03:06:10,628
Tell the politicians
to burn their paper now.

1536
03:06:10,878 --> 03:06:12,213
Fair enough.

1537
03:06:12,714 --> 03:06:15,592
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

1538
03:06:16,342 --> 03:06:18,261
It's going to happen.

1539
03:06:18,928 --> 03:06:21,055
I shall want quite a lot of money.

1540
03:06:21,764 --> 03:06:23,433
All there is.

1541
03:06:23,933 --> 03:06:25,560
Not that much.

1542
03:06:28,855 --> 03:06:31,608
The best of them
won't come for money.

1543
03:06:33,484 --> 03:06:34,902
They'll come for me.

1544
03:06:53,379 --> 03:06:54,631
No pictures!

1545
03:06:54,922 --> 03:06:57,258
It's not for you, it's for Major Lawrence.

1546
03:06:57,467 --> 03:07:01,638
He doesn't mind having his picture
taken. He doesn't mind at all.

1547
03:07:01,888 --> 03:07:04,140
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

1548
03:07:08,603 --> 03:07:11,189
Have you met Major Lawrence
since he's come back?

1549
03:07:11,481 --> 03:07:12,774
Yes.

1550
03:07:12,940 --> 03:07:15,318
- Changed, hasn't he?
- No.

1551
03:07:15,485 --> 03:07:18,404
Oh, I'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.

1552
03:07:23,159 --> 03:07:26,829
What did that Turkish general
do to him in Deraa?

1553
03:07:27,538 --> 03:07:32,335
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.

1554
03:07:34,003 --> 03:07:36,547
What did the English general
do to him in Jerusalem?

1555
03:07:36,839 --> 03:07:38,508
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

1556
03:07:38,716 --> 03:07:40,677
- I did.
- What did he say?

1557
03:07:40,927 --> 03:07:42,512
He laughed.

1558
03:07:43,012 --> 03:07:45,640
He told me to gather the Harith here.

1559
03:07:46,182 --> 03:07:47,725
He offered me money.

1560
03:07:48,017 --> 03:07:49,560
Did you take it?

1561
03:07:50,353 --> 03:07:52,980
No. But many did.

1562
03:08:30,727 --> 03:08:33,771
- What is this?
- This is my bodyguard.

1563
03:08:34,480 --> 03:08:37,108
There is not a man
without a price on his head.

1564
03:08:37,400 --> 03:08:41,028
- There's a price on my head too.
- But these are murderers.

1565
03:08:41,237 --> 03:08:43,239
The sheiks will hang these men.

1566
03:08:43,489 --> 03:08:45,241
These men are mine.

1567
03:08:45,742 --> 03:08:50,079
Lawrence, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.

1568
03:08:50,413 --> 03:08:53,875
- You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
- Sherif?

1569
03:08:54,083 --> 03:08:57,086
- Where do we ride?
- Damascus, sherif.

1570
03:08:57,295 --> 03:08:59,213
Aye, but for what?

1571
03:08:59,422 --> 03:09:01,591
Sherif, for Lawrence.

1572
03:09:04,719 --> 03:09:08,055
- You have bought these things.
- I bought half the men here, Ali.

1573
03:09:08,264 --> 03:09:11,058
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.

1574
03:09:11,267 --> 03:09:14,270
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!

1575
03:09:18,274 --> 03:09:20,109
Damascus!

1576
03:09:20,318 --> 03:09:22,445
Damascus! Damascus!

1577
03:09:22,653 --> 03:09:25,740
Damascus! Damascus!

1578
03:09:59,607 --> 03:10:03,152
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's
gone through Mazril and Deraa.

1579
03:10:03,444 --> 03:10:07,073
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.

1580
03:10:07,281 --> 03:10:10,952
If the enemy's retreating in
any order, which we'll assume--

1581
03:10:11,118 --> 03:10:12,161
Certainly.

1582
03:10:12,328 --> 03:10:14,080
He can't be far from Mallud...

1583
03:10:14,705 --> 03:10:19,001
...in which case I can have him
within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

1584
03:10:19,293 --> 03:10:21,295
Splendid. Philip.

1585
03:10:21,671 --> 03:10:24,340
These are the last infantry supports
going up now.

1586
03:10:24,632 --> 03:10:28,177
But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

1587
03:10:28,845 --> 03:10:32,306
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.

1588
03:10:32,473 --> 03:10:33,724
Any questions?

1589
03:10:34,183 --> 03:10:38,312
This Arab army on the right, sir,
what's it consist of?

1590
03:10:38,813 --> 03:10:41,023
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.

1591
03:10:41,190 --> 03:10:43,109
Where are they now?

1592
03:10:43,818 --> 03:10:48,698
- Can only know by being with them.
- Then get with them. I want to know.

1593
03:10:49,031 --> 03:10:51,325
Pound them, Charley.

1594
03:10:51,909 --> 03:10:53,327
Pound them.

1595
03:11:03,880 --> 03:11:06,716
God help the men who lie under that.

1596
03:11:06,924 --> 03:11:08,551
They're Turks.

1597
03:11:08,759 --> 03:11:10,428
God help them.

1598
03:11:53,179 --> 03:11:56,933
Well, he's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1599
03:11:57,183 --> 03:11:58,476
Cocky?

1600
03:11:58,684 --> 03:12:00,436
More than cocky, sir.

1601
03:12:00,728 --> 03:12:04,065
He's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1602
03:12:04,273 --> 03:12:07,777
I tell you, sir, I think
he'll get to Damascus before we do.

1603
03:12:08,444 --> 03:12:10,279
- Unless...
- Unless?

1604
03:12:10,446 --> 03:12:14,325
Well, there's a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.

1605
03:12:14,617 --> 03:12:17,578
- What do the Turks have in Mazril?
- A brigade, sir.

1606
03:12:20,581 --> 03:12:22,792
I wonder where they are now.

1607
03:14:04,852 --> 03:14:06,020
No prisoners.

1608
03:14:09,523 --> 03:14:11,609
Damascus, Lawrence.

1609
03:14:21,535 --> 03:14:24,371
Lawrence, not this.

1610
03:14:25,081 --> 03:14:29,085
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

1611
03:14:29,835 --> 03:14:31,420
No prisoners.

1612
03:14:41,555 --> 03:14:43,140
This was Talaal's village.

1613
03:14:47,394 --> 03:14:49,396
Talaal!

1614
03:14:59,406 --> 03:15:00,616
Talaal!

1615
03:15:09,667 --> 03:15:11,669
No prisoners!

1616
03:15:12,128 --> 03:15:13,254
No prisoners!

1617
03:15:25,141 --> 03:15:26,433
God.

1618
03:15:30,187 --> 03:15:31,522
God.

1619
03:15:33,440 --> 03:15:34,817
God!

1620
03:17:52,121 --> 03:17:55,291
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!

1621
03:19:32,679 --> 03:19:33,889
Major!

1622
03:19:34,556 --> 03:19:36,225
Major Lawrence!

1623
03:19:41,897 --> 03:19:43,524
Jesus wept.

1624
03:19:59,081 --> 03:20:00,374
Jesus wept.

1625
03:20:02,251 --> 03:20:04,294
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

1626
03:20:04,920 --> 03:20:07,714
Surely you know
the Arabs are a barbarous people.

1627
03:20:07,923 --> 03:20:09,758
Barbarous and cruel.

1628
03:20:10,592 --> 03:20:12,469
Who but they?

1629
03:20:12,886 --> 03:20:14,221
Who but they?

1630
03:20:16,557 --> 03:20:18,934
Oh, you rotten man.

1631
03:20:19,977 --> 03:20:24,398
Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.

1632
03:20:26,483 --> 03:20:28,610
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

1633
03:20:55,095 --> 03:20:58,599
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.

1634
03:20:59,016 --> 03:21:00,726
Damascus!

1635
03:21:00,934 --> 03:21:02,811
Take them to Sherif Ali.

1636
03:21:03,020 --> 03:21:04,438
Tell him.

1637
03:21:05,439 --> 03:21:07,149
Remind him.

1638
03:21:07,983 --> 03:21:11,111
- Is Allenby in Damascus?
- Neat

1639
03:21:11,945 --> 03:21:14,239
Tell Sherif Ali that.

1640
03:21:15,491 --> 03:21:17,326
They are not ripe.

1641
03:21:23,290 --> 03:21:25,334
General salute!

1642
03:21:25,501 --> 03:21:30,214
Present arms!

1643
03:21:42,142 --> 03:21:44,019
Port arms!

1644
03:21:46,813 --> 03:21:48,690
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

1645
03:21:48,899 --> 03:21:51,777
The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.

1646
03:21:58,075 --> 03:21:59,868
- When?
- A day and a night, sir.

1647
03:22:00,077 --> 03:22:01,995
They've been here a day and a night.

1648
03:22:02,204 --> 03:22:04,706
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.

1649
03:22:04,998 --> 03:22:08,877
He's set up his own headquarters
in the town hall.

1650
03:22:09,795 --> 03:22:11,588
What else beside the town hall?

1651
03:22:11,880 --> 03:22:14,716
Telephone exchange,
post office, powerhouse...

1652
03:22:15,008 --> 03:22:17,386
“hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.

1653
03:22:17,594 --> 03:22:20,556
They call themselves
the Arab National Council...

1654
03:22:20,722 --> 03:22:22,391
...and they're in the town hall.

1655
03:22:22,683 --> 03:22:25,561
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.

1656
03:22:27,229 --> 03:22:28,730
What should we do about it?

1657
03:22:28,939 --> 03:22:31,358
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

1658
03:22:32,234 --> 03:22:34,069
How about that, Dryden?

1659
03:22:35,862 --> 03:22:38,574
Not unless you want
a full-scale rising.

1660
03:22:39,366 --> 03:22:42,411
- What, then?
- When will Feisal be in Damascus?

1661
03:22:42,578 --> 03:22:44,621
By special train in two days' time.

1662
03:22:44,913 --> 03:22:46,206
Two days.

1663
03:22:46,373 --> 03:22:49,751
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.

1664
03:22:50,043 --> 03:22:52,087
-Isn't it enough?
- Yes.

1665
03:22:52,254 --> 03:22:55,716
- Ample, I should think.
- We can't just do nothing.

1666
03:22:55,924 --> 03:22:59,595
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.

1667
03:22:59,845 --> 03:23:04,099
And Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.

1668
03:23:04,474 --> 03:23:06,101
Does that apply to technical units?

1669
03:23:06,393 --> 03:23:08,478
Technical units particularly.

1670
03:23:08,770 --> 03:23:10,105
Yes, sir.

1671
03:23:10,647 --> 03:23:12,107
Medicals too, sir?

1672
03:23:12,357 --> 03:23:14,568
I'm afraid so, Harry.

1673
03:23:14,901 --> 03:23:16,612
Medicals too.

1674
03:23:56,985 --> 03:23:58,528
We here...

1675
03:23:58,779 --> 03:24:01,657
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

1676
03:24:01,823 --> 03:24:04,993
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

1677
03:24:05,327 --> 03:24:08,789
...of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.

1678
03:24:08,997 --> 03:24:11,041
He insulted me.

1679
03:24:12,167 --> 03:24:16,296
Sherif Ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat...

1680
03:24:16,505 --> 03:24:19,341
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.

1681
03:24:19,841 --> 03:24:23,553
They will not work because
they are given no electricity.

1682
03:24:23,804 --> 03:24:27,349
The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.

1683
03:24:29,810 --> 03:24:32,145
If you answer,
there will be bloodshed.

1684
03:24:33,021 --> 03:24:36,525
You speak to me of bloodshed?

1685
03:24:39,236 --> 03:24:43,198
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

1686
03:24:43,448 --> 03:24:44,991
Humbly?

1687
03:24:45,158 --> 03:24:46,535
Humbly, Harith?

1688
03:24:46,827 --> 03:24:48,829
Yes, humbly.

1689
03:24:49,204 --> 03:24:51,331
This is a new trick.

1690
03:24:52,332 --> 03:24:54,000
Why is there no electricity?

1691
03:24:54,960 --> 03:24:57,713
I have been to that
electrical house, Lawrence.

1692
03:24:57,963 --> 03:25:00,841
There are three large machines.

1693
03:25:01,049 --> 03:25:03,385
He means generators!

1694
03:25:03,885 --> 03:25:05,053
So.

1695
03:25:05,512 --> 03:25:07,222
One of them is burning.

1696
03:25:07,472 --> 03:25:10,559
They are of an incredible size,
but helpless.

1697
03:25:10,892 --> 03:25:13,603
It is so of all machines.

1698
03:25:13,854 --> 03:25:17,858
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?

1699
03:25:20,527 --> 03:25:23,697
- The need is absolute.
- Then we need English engineers.

1700
03:25:23,905 --> 03:25:27,576
No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.

1701
03:25:27,868 --> 03:25:29,077
Take--

1702
03:25:33,206 --> 03:25:34,416
Fire has broken out.

1703
03:25:34,624 --> 03:25:36,209
- Where?
- The Jinsibi district.

1704
03:25:36,418 --> 03:25:39,296
- It is not a district that matters.
- It will spread!

1705
03:25:39,588 --> 03:25:41,256
Then use the fire brigade!

1706
03:25:41,548 --> 03:25:44,426
We have tried,
but there is no force in the water.

1707
03:25:44,634 --> 03:25:46,136
Then you must carry it.

1708
03:25:46,428 --> 03:25:50,766
- The Ruala do not carry water.
- What else are they good for?

1709
03:26:03,069 --> 03:26:06,615
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

1710
03:26:09,451 --> 03:26:11,161
This afternoon!

1711
03:26:34,935 --> 03:26:38,939
<i>- I'll</i> take this up after the war.
- Surely we should do something, sir.

1712
03:26:39,147 --> 03:26:43,109
- It's an old man's sport.
- Are you an old man, sir?

1713
03:26:43,318 --> 03:26:46,196
All I can say is, sir,
it's a heavy responsibility.

1714
03:26:47,656 --> 03:26:48,990
Sorry, sir.

1715
03:26:51,201 --> 03:26:52,869
Maybe it's the bulb.

1716
03:26:57,582 --> 03:26:58,708
No, sir.

1717
03:26:59,167 --> 03:27:00,836
It's the power.

1718
03:27:16,017 --> 03:27:17,394
They're leaving.

1719
03:27:18,103 --> 03:27:19,813
That's it, then.

1720
03:27:20,313 --> 03:27:22,399
Marvellous-looking beggars,
aren't they?

1721
03:27:43,628 --> 03:27:46,506
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

1722
03:27:46,756 --> 03:27:48,758
- Come where?
- Back.

1723
03:27:53,221 --> 03:27:55,432
I know your heart.

1724
03:28:03,899 --> 03:28:05,525
What is it?

1725
03:28:06,526 --> 03:28:08,194
Is it this?

1726
03:28:10,906 --> 03:28:14,034
I tell you, this is nothing.

1727
03:28:27,213 --> 03:28:28,882
Is it the blood?

1728
03:28:29,674 --> 03:28:32,761
The desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of.

1729
03:28:34,304 --> 03:28:38,683
I pray that I may never
see the desert again.

1730
03:28:39,768 --> 03:28:41,061
Hear me, God.

1731
03:28:42,771 --> 03:28:46,608
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.

1732
03:29:03,458 --> 03:29:04,751
What about you?

1733
03:29:05,752 --> 03:29:09,339
No, I shall stay here
and learn politics.

1734
03:29:11,841 --> 03:29:13,259
A very low occupation.

1735
03:29:13,760 --> 03:29:16,805
I had not thought of it
when I met you.

1736
03:29:25,772 --> 03:29:28,650
You have tried very hard
to give us Damascus.

1737
03:29:28,858 --> 03:29:30,777
It's what I came for.

1738
03:29:34,280 --> 03:29:35,532
And then...

1739
03:29:37,951 --> 03:29:39,327
...it would be something.

1740
03:29:39,536 --> 03:29:40,787
Yes.

1741
03:29:41,454 --> 03:29:42,664
Much.

1742
03:30:01,683 --> 03:30:04,144
- He is your friend?
- Take your hand away.

1743
03:30:04,352 --> 03:30:05,645
- You love him.
- I fear him.

1744
03:30:05,854 --> 03:30:07,689
Then why do you weep?

1745
03:30:08,023 --> 03:30:10,191
If I fear him, who love him...

1746
03:30:10,358 --> 03:30:13,319
...how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?

1747
03:30:13,695 --> 03:30:16,823
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

1748
03:30:19,200 --> 03:30:22,537
So you are not yet entirely politician.

1749
03:30:22,704 --> 03:30:23,788
Not yet.

1750
03:30:24,039 --> 03:30:28,376
Well, these are new tricks,
and I am an old dog.

1751
03:30:28,918 --> 03:30:30,837
And Allah be thanked.

1752
03:30:31,337 --> 03:30:32,714
I'll tell thee what...

1753
03:30:33,006 --> 03:30:36,342
...being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.

1754
03:30:57,822 --> 03:31:01,117
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.

1755
03:31:01,409 --> 03:31:04,245
It comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.

1756
03:31:04,454 --> 03:31:08,833
Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.

1757
03:31:09,084 --> 03:31:12,087
Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.

1758
03:31:12,378 --> 03:31:13,922
No, sir, I will not.

1759
03:31:14,881 --> 03:31:16,466
Control yourself.

1760
03:31:16,966 --> 03:31:20,095
Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.

1761
03:31:21,054 --> 03:31:23,348
We did what we could
in the civic hospitals.

1762
03:31:23,556 --> 03:31:26,392
But you forgot
the Turkish Military Hospital.

1763
03:31:26,768 --> 03:31:31,231
It has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

1764
03:31:31,898 --> 03:31:36,486
All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.

1765
03:31:43,243 --> 03:31:44,661
What's it like?

1766
03:33:01,529 --> 03:33:03,573
This is outrageous!

1767
03:33:04,699 --> 03:33:06,576
Outrageous!

1768
03:33:09,829 --> 03:33:11,539
Outrageous!

1769
03:33:12,665 --> 03:33:14,876
You filthy little wog!

1770
03:33:25,386 --> 03:33:29,474
My friend Lawrence,
if I may call him that.

1771
03:33:29,724 --> 03:33:32,185
"My friend Lawrence."

1772
03:33:32,393 --> 03:33:37,023
How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.

1773
03:33:37,232 --> 03:33:39,901
He longs for the greenness
of his native land.

1774
03:33:40,109 --> 03:33:45,240
He pines for the Gothic cottages
of Surrey, is it not?

1775
03:33:45,490 --> 03:33:49,077
Already in imagination,
he catches trout...

1776
03:33:49,369 --> 03:33:52,872
...and all the activities
of the English gentleman.

1777
03:33:53,081 --> 03:33:56,584
That's me you're describing, sir,
not Colonel Lawrence.

1778
03:33:57,502 --> 03:33:59,712
You're promoted colonel.

1779
03:33:59,921 --> 03:34:02,382
Yes. What for?

1780
03:34:02,590 --> 03:34:05,760
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.

1781
03:34:06,010 --> 03:34:10,098
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home.

1782
03:34:10,723 --> 03:34:13,017
Then, thank you.

1783
03:34:17,230 --> 03:34:18,439
Well, then...

1784
03:34:19,065 --> 03:34:20,108
...Godspeed.

1785
03:34:20,608 --> 03:34:24,529
There's nothing further here
for a warrior.

1786
03:34:24,779 --> 03:34:28,908
We drive bargains. Old men's work.

1787
03:34:29,117 --> 03:34:31,452
Young men make wars,
and the virtues of war...

1788
03:34:31,619 --> 03:34:33,538
...are the virtues of young men.

1789
03:34:33,788 --> 03:34:37,250
Courage and hope for the future.

1790
03:34:37,458 --> 03:34:40,128
Then old men make the peace.

1791
03:34:41,254 --> 03:34:44,132
And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.

1792
03:34:44,340 --> 03:34:46,801
Mistrust and caution.

1793
03:34:47,760 --> 03:34:49,595
It must be so.

1794
03:35:05,987 --> 03:35:10,616
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.

1795
03:35:20,335 --> 03:35:24,005
The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these I concede.

1796
03:35:24,297 --> 03:35:26,007
The pumping plant I must retain.

1797
03:35:26,215 --> 03:35:28,801
If you retain it,
there will be no water.

1798
03:35:29,010 --> 03:35:32,722
- I shall be glad of assistance.
- Then you must bring down your flag.

1799
03:35:33,014 --> 03:35:36,851
I shall not, and if your men
attempt it, my men will resist it.

1800
03:35:37,143 --> 03:35:38,811
- Have you men?
- Enough for that.

1801
03:35:39,020 --> 03:35:41,397
It's a thing that
makes an ugly incident.

1802
03:35:41,731 --> 03:35:43,608
I'm sure your government...

1803
03:35:43,858 --> 03:35:47,695
...does not wish to appear at the peace
conference as an aggressor.

1804
03:35:49,989 --> 03:35:51,491
<i>L</i> say!

1805
03:35:52,867 --> 03:35:54,827
It's Lawrence, isn't it?

1806
03:35:57,163 --> 03:35:59,374
May I shake your hand, sir?

1807
03:36:00,541 --> 03:36:03,169
Just want to be able
to say I'd done it, sir.

1808
03:36:06,756 --> 03:36:09,008
Haven't we met before?

1809
03:36:09,217 --> 03:36:10,843
Don't think so, sir.

1810
03:36:11,052 --> 03:36:13,763
No, no, sir, I should remember that.

1811
03:36:19,018 --> 03:36:23,189
It is widely known the Arab Council
took power in my name.

1812
03:36:23,398 --> 03:36:25,400
They have no power. It's illusory.

1813
03:36:25,650 --> 03:36:28,069
Illusions can be very powerful.

1814
03:36:28,444 --> 03:36:30,071
Particularly...

1815
03:36:30,947 --> 03:36:33,574
...when they take this form.

1816
03:36:35,743 --> 03:36:38,746
The world is delighted
at the picture of Damascus...

1817
03:36:38,955 --> 03:36:40,915
...liberated by the Arab army.

1818
03:36:41,457 --> 03:36:44,544
Led, may I remind you,
by a British-serving officer.

1819
03:36:45,086 --> 03:36:50,091
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence
is a sword with two edges.

1820
03:36:50,383 --> 03:36:53,428
We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?

1821
03:36:57,056 --> 03:36:59,267
I thought I was a hard man, sir.

1822
03:37:00,101 --> 03:37:02,395
You are merely a general.

1823
03:37:04,939 --> 03:37:06,441
I must be a king.

1824
03:37:09,444 --> 03:37:11,320
Excuse me, sir.

1825
03:37:25,960 --> 03:37:27,253
Well?

1826
03:37:28,129 --> 03:37:29,505
Well...

1827
03:37:29,964 --> 03:37:32,842
...it seems we're to have
a British waterworks...

1828
03:37:33,092 --> 03:37:35,303
...with an Arab flag on it.

1829
03:37:35,511 --> 03:37:37,472
Do you think it was worth it?

1830
03:37:37,638 --> 03:37:40,308
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.

1831
03:37:40,641 --> 03:37:41,809
Yes, sir.

1832
03:37:42,101 --> 03:37:43,728
So you keep saying.

1833
03:37:43,936 --> 03:37:45,521
You, I suspect...

1834
03:37:46,022 --> 03:37:49,942
...are chief architect
of this compromise.

1835
03:37:50,359 --> 03:37:53,488
- What do you think?
- Me, Your Highness?

1836
03:37:54,155 --> 03:37:58,451
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

1837
03:38:36,489 --> 03:38:39,534
Well, sir. Going home.

1838
03:38:41,869 --> 03:38:43,538
Home, sir.
