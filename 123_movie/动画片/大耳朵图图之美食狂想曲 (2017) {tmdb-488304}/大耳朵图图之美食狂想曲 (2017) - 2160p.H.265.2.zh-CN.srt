I'll do it. I like ellen.

Yeah, well,
it's pretty emotional.

44
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:20,459
I tell my mother that I never
felt she really, um, loved me.

You're gonna yell
at each other?
Oh, I don't know.

I'm just gonna go with how I feel,
which is the scary part.

I'm not blaming anybody, wanda.

64

All I'm saying is that we left last night
and I knew we didn't get that scene.

65
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:50,049
I'm sorry, I thought
it was a great scene, Nick.

66

It was okay and I can use it.
It's gonna be all right.

00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:55,554
But today I'm not gonna
settle for okay.

I know, but let's try it anyway.

No, dolly.

back to a close-up.

I'll use the 35.
It'll minimize the distortion.

before we get started.

hoping he would
leave me alone.

108

and started hitting danny.

of this whatsoever.

110

You were just standing there
looking at me, mom.

111
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:24,203
Then you... then you pulled me up
and said, "you're not hurt."

for faking,

to keep him from hitting me again.

your boom's all over my frame.

00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:50,349
Okay, do I have a lockup?
Yes.

154
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:54,853
Is that a real lockup?
Yes.

155
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,855
Okay, here we go right away.

156
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,358
First positions, please.
[Walkie-talkie] okay.

157
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,361
All right, and roll sound.
Speed.

158
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,863
Roll camera.
Rolling. Scene six, take four.

159
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,868
[Walkie-talkie]
Set? Yeah.

160
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,371
Are we set?
All right.

161
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,873
Call it again, wanda.
All right, and roll sound.

162
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:16,875
Speed.
Roll camera. Roll...

163
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,877
second sticks.
Oh, shit.

164
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:20,879
Scene six...
everybody just settle!

165
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,382
Bert, get the hell
outta there!

166
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:26,885
Action.

167
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:30,389
Dad hit me first
and knocked me down.

168
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,392
It didn't hurt that much,
but...

169
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:38,897
I started crying anyway,
just hoping he would leave me alone.

170
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:41,400
Then he went over
and started hitting danny.

171
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,404
Ellen, I have no memory
of this whatsoever.

172
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,407
You were just standing there
looking at me, mom.

173
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,409
Then you came over and...
[wolf] Boom's in.

174
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:52,411
That's a cut.
[Sighs] Jesus christ!

175
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,913
[Les] where at?
The whole left side of the frame, les.

176
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:58,417
All right, all right.
Can we get a motherfucking frame line, please?

177
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,420
Yo, the frame line keep changing.

178
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,923
That's the idea, les.
May I make a suggestion?

179
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:08,427
Would it be possible
to maybe break the shot down?

180
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,929
Maybe we could make it two shots instead?
It might be easier for les.

181
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:15,434
No. Then I'm gonna need ten minutes
to switch to radio mics.

182
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:18,937
It's your call, Nick.
Will there be any more sound problems?

183
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:21,940
No more boom problems.

184
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,942
Switch to radios.

185
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:27,946
All right, that's a ten minute break.
Everybody please stand by.

186
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:30,449
Get me a coffee.

187
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,951
Half milk.
Here.

188
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,957
Oh, Nicole, I'm really sorry about all this.
[Laughs]

189
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:41,960
Oh, no, no, no. It's not your fault,
Nick. No.

190
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,463
[Sighs] Um, listen,
I was wondering,

191
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:48,467
Is there any way to use some of those
earlier takes?

192
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,969
Not unless I change the shot
and do a cutaway of cora...

193
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,971
and then find a way
to intercut the takes.

194
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:55,474
But I don't want to do that.
This is a really nice shot. No?

195
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:57,976
What you're doing is incredible.
Really?

196
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,978
Really incredible.
Okay.

197
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,980
All right?
Yeah.

198
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,982
Once we get the radio mics on,
it's gonna go smoother.

199
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:08,487
So you just... whatever. Take a moment.
Let all this shit go. Yeah.

200
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,489
Do whatever you, you know...
all right.

201
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,991
We're not gonna roll until you're ready, okay?
Yeah, thanks.

202
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:14,993
Okay.
Okay.

203
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,997
How was she in that
richard gere movie? [Woman sighs]

204
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:25,003
Eh... so-so.
Her career really took off, didn't it?

205
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:28,006
I saw her in a michael bolton video.
Oh, yeah?

206
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:31,510
Yeah, too bad.
She is... nice.

207
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,513
Yeah. I could have done
a better job though.

208
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:40,519
No, you still boom, les,
but keep it wide! Wide!

209
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,027
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where's that scrim going?

210
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:52,030
It's a flag.

211
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,534
Wolf? No, no, no. No more tweaking. No.
Two seconds, wanda.

212
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,536
Lock it up. Picture's up.
[Man] Closer to the light, bob.

213
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,540
Can we get Nick in here?
Nick? Nick? Nick! Bring it up against the bulb.

214
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,042
Call it, wanda.
All right. And roll sound.

215
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:05,544
- Speed.
- Roll camera.

216
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:08,547
- Rolling.
- Scene six, take five.

217
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:11,550
[Whispers] Shake it off.

218
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:18,056
Action.

219
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:22,561
Dad hit me first
and knocked me down.

220
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:26,064
It didn't hurt that much,
but...

221
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:30,068
I started crying anyway,
hoping he would leave me alone.

222
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:34,072
Then he went over and started hitting danny.
Ellen, I have no memory...

223
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,574
[cora screams]
Damn it!

224
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,577
[Man] The light! The light!
You blew the bulb!

225
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,079
Jesus fucking christ!
Kill it! Kill it! Pull the plug!

226
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,081
By your foot!
[Wanda] That's a cut! All right!

227
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:47,085
Is everybody hurt? Is anybody okay?
Okay, cora, are you all right?

228
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:50,589
Props. Props! Props, can we get
a broom in here, please?

229
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,592
All right,
clear the set... please.

230
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:57,095
[Walkie-talkie]
Are you rolling? Props!

231
00:14:57,095 --> 00:15:00,599
Props, get a broom in here right away!
Clear the set!

232
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,601
[Crew chattering, glass being swept]

233
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:06,605
Cora.
[Sighs, chuckles]

234
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:10,108
Cora.
What's gonna happen next?

235
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:12,110
I'm gonna have
a heart attack!

236
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,114
No, no, no, you're not.
If you do, save it for the end of the scene, okay?

237
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:18,116
[Laughing]
No, I'm kidding.

238
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:20,619
We're gonna go in there in two minutes,
and we are gonna nail this scene.

239
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,622
Then we're gonna be outta here. I swear.
Okay? Nicole...

240
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,624
[wanda]
Nick.

241
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,627
One second.

242
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,130
[Wanda] Nick.
Uh, okay.

243
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,132
I'll tell you one thing right now.

244
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:38,637
I am never, ever going to do another
fuckin' low-budget movie!

245
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,140
What's up?

246
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,643
Wolf and I were talking.

247
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,646
Ellen's...
losing it a little bit.

248
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:52,651
We have got three-quarters
of the scene really, really incredible.

249
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:54,653
All you need to do
is a quick cutaway,

250
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:57,656
and then we pick up
the last part of the scene.

251
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:01,159
[Sighs] Wolf?

252
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,162
Well, you know
how I feel.

253
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:08,166
I-I love the shot.
Hell, I designed it.

254
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,669
Okay, then can we just stick
with the game plan, please?

255
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,171
It's a simple shot.
I swear to god, we're gonna get it.

256
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:15,173
All right? I can feel it.
Okay.

257
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:18,677
Yeah, whatever it takes.
We're here for you. [Sighs]

258
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:23,181
Thanks.

259
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,185
[Wanda] Okay, and roll sound.
Speed.

260
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,688
- Roll camera.
- Rolling!

261
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,691
Scene six, take six.

262
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:37,696
Let's stay focused.
And... action.

263
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:43,702
Dad hit me first
and knocked me down.

264
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,204
It didn't hurt that much,
but...

265
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:50,709
I started crying anyway,
hoping he would leave me alone.

266
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:56,214
Then he started hitting danny.
Ellen, I... I...

267
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,220
cut!

268
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:07,225
Okay. That's okay.
Uh, cora, just give me the line.

269
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:10,729
No acting, just, just...
what's your line?

270
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:15,233
[Man coughs, mumbles]
Ellen...

271
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:19,237
I have no memory
of this line whatsoever.

272
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:21,239
[Crew laughing]
[Wanda] All right, all right.

273
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,742
Can we get the line please?
Script. Script. Script.

274
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:28,246
"Ellen, I have no memory
of this whatsoever." Okay?

275
00:17:28,246 --> 00:17:30,749
Thank you. All right,
picture up, people.

276
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,752
Back to one, camera.
Come on, guys, let's not lose the energy.

277
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,754
Right away!
Let's go. Whoa, whoa.

278
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,756
And keep the lockup.
Nicole, you all right?

279
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,258
Let's get what we had before.
Are we ready? All right.

280
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:42,260
And roll sound.
Speed.

281
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,262
Roll camera.
Rolling!

282
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:48,266
[Yawns]
Scene six, take seven.

283
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,770
[Exhales]

284
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,773
Action.

285
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:59,778
Dad hit me first
and, uh, knocked me down.

286
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,280
It didn't hurt that much,
but...

287
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,786
I started crying anyway,
hoping he would leave me alone.

288
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,788
Then he started hitting danny.

289
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,791
I was worried
about danny!

290
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,797
I'm sorry, I...
I'm lost.

291
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,799
Cut.
That's a cut.

292
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,802
All right,
uh, everyone just relax.

293
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,804
We're gonna run the lines,
okay? No acting.

294
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,806
We'll do a run-through
for the lines. That's it.

295
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,808
Then we're gonna shoot
the fucking scene.

296
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:42,821
I'm sorry I'm fucking
this up for you.

297
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,823
Cora, please,
don't even say that.

298
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:47,826
I'm the one who's
totally fucking this up.

299
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,828
I swear to god,
if I get through this,

300
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:53,832
I am never acting again.

301
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,358
Action on the run-through.

302
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:32,370
Dad hit me...
hit me first...

303
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,372
and knocked me down.

304
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:37,375
It didn't hurt
that much, but...

305
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:42,380
I started crying anyway,
hoping he would just leave me alone.

306
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,382
[Whispers] Roll camera.

307
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,385
Then he went over
and started hitting danny.

308
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:49,888
Shouldn't we wait
for wolf? [Nicole crying]

309
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:54,392
Ellen, I have no memory
of this whatsoever.

310
00:19:54,392 --> 00:20:00,398
Ma, you were just
standing there looking at me.

311
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,901
Then you pulled me up
and said,

312
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,404
"you're not hurt."
[Crying]

313
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,406
Like I was disgusting
for faking,

314
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,410
for doing the only thing I could think of to keep him
from hitting me again.

315
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,914
I was worried about danny.

316
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,920
[Nicole crying]
You do remember.

317
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,423
[Cora]
Well, he was
smaller than you.

318
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:29,928
You were so worried
about danny, ma.

319
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:34,933
What about me,
you know?

320
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,435
Why weren't you
worried about me?

321
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,444
[Crying]

322
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,451
Where the fuck is wolf?

323
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:56,454
One second.

324
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:58,957
[Vomits]

325
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,467
Okay, listen up.

326
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:13,471
Nobody drink the milk.
It appears to be bad.

327
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:18,977
Okay, I've had to...
I'm changing the shot.

328
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,981
I'm a little pressed for time,
so we start with a close-up of ellen...

329
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:26,484
for the last part of the scene,
starting with your line,
"I was worried about danny."

330
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:30,488
Mm-hmm. Then i'll find a way to cut
that into the fourth take.

331
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:34,492
[Sighs, laughs]
We almost had that.

332
00:21:34,492 --> 00:21:36,494
Almost. That was beautiful.
Both of you.

333
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,497
That was just, uh...

334
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:45,003
can't think about that, right?
That moment's gone and, uh,
we'll get another one, right?

335
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,505
Right? Okay.
Here we go.

336
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,013
I'm ready, Nick.

337
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,016
Call it, wanda.
And roll sound. Speed.

338
00:21:58,516 --> 00:22:01,519
Roll camera. Rolling!
Scene six apple, pickup, take one.

339
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,023
[Clapper snaps]
Action.

340
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,525
I was worried
about danny.

341
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:09,527
You do remember.

342
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:11,529
He's smaller
than you.

343
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:16,534
[Beeping]
You were s...

344
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:20,538
you were so worried about danny.
What about me? [Beeping continues]

345
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:24,542
Why weren't you worried
about me? Jesus christ! [Beeping continues]

346
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,545
Cut! What the fuck is that, sound?

347
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,547
- It's not me!
- It's the camera.

348
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:32,550
Fuck it is! It's off!
It wasn't even running, dick les!

349
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,553
What is going on down there?
Do I have a lockup? [Beeping continues]

350
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:41,059
You don't hear a beeping sound?
The street's quiet. [Beeping continues]

351
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,562
[Beeping continues]

352
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:47,065
What the fuck is it?

353
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,568
[Beeping continues]

354
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:53,071
It's somebody's watch.

355
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,073
[Beeping continues]

356
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:59,577
- It's not mine.
- It's not mine.
- It's not mine.

357
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:02,080
[Beeping continues]
Okay, where is it?

358
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,084
Cock-sucking, motherfucking
bastard! Where are you? [Beeping continues]

359
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:09,087
[Beeping continues]

360
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:12,590
Take a walk, les. Go get coffee
and don't come back, all right?

361
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,094
[Cora screams]
[Beeping continues]

362
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:19,097
I said no food on set!

363
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,099
[Beeping continues]

364
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,601
Where are you?

365
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:27,105
[Beeping continues]

366
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:30,608
[Panting] Could somebody help me, please?
[Beeping continues]

367
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:35,113
Huh? Do I have to do everything myself here?
[Beeping continues]

368
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:38,116
Huh, cora? Why don't you go learn
your lines, cora!

369
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:42,120
[Beeping continues]
Hey, script, how about paying
attention a little bit, okay?

370
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,122
[Beeping continues] Hey, focus puller,
I got some good thaI stick.

371
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,624
[Beeping continues]
You wanna go fuckin' smoke one
or you wanna pay attention?

372
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:50,628
What are you laughing at, wolf?
You fuckin' pretentious, beret-wearin' motherfucker!

373
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:52,630
[Beeping continues] Hey, I saw your reel, man.
It sucked!

374
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,633
[Beeping continues]
Who the fuck would hire you?
Hey, bob! Hey, bob!

375
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:58,636
[Beeping continues]
Can you make a little noise
on the fucking dolly? Huh?

376
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:00,638
[Beeping continues]
You creaky motherfucker!

377
00:24:00,638 --> 00:24:05,643
Wanda, next time can you wear
a shirt that's a little more
distracting to my actors?

378
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:08,646
[Beeping continues]
What is your name anyway? What
do you fucking do around here?

379
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:11,649
[Beeping continues]
Hey, speedo! You can't find
a little fucking beep?

380
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:15,153
Huh? You see what I have to fucking
deal with here, Nicole?

381
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,655
[Beeping continues]
Maybe do some of that magic on camera!

382
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:22,160
No, no, wait 'til fuckin' wolf
is pukin' his guts out! "Oh, now, i'll be good."

383
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,662
[Nick's voice echoing, beeping continues]

384
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:29,667
[Beeping continues]

385
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:33,171
[Screaming]

386
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,173
[Gasps]

387
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:40,678
[Beeping continues]

388
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:43,681
[Turns off alarm,
beeping stops]

389
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:49,687
[Panting]

390
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,190
Oh, god.

391
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:07,705
[Wolf]
So when did he ask you?

392
00:25:07,705 --> 00:25:11,209
Yesterday when I was helping him
check into his hotel.

393
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:15,213
What? The guy can't even check into his hotel room
by himself?

394
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,215
Listen, wolf...

395
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:22,720
having chad palomino in this movie
will be a benefit to us all.

396
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,724
If being there when he checks into his hotel
makes him feel better,

397
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:29,227
then I'm more than happy to do it.
[Horn honking]

398
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,729
Well, how did it come up?

399
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:35,233
He asked me if I liked jazz,
I said yes,

400
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:39,737
and he suggested we meet at a jazz
club tonight.

401
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:43,241
I like jazz.
He did not invite you.

402
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:47,745
[Sprays perfume] Why are you wearing
perfume to work?

403
00:25:47,745 --> 00:25:50,248
Because I feel like it.
You didn't wear it yesterday.

404
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:53,751
[Sighs] Oh, god, stop acting
like such a child.

405
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:56,754
Ow! My eye!
Oh!

406
00:25:56,754 --> 00:25:59,257
Oh, god, sweetheart, are you all right?
[Groaning]

407
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,759
Do I look all right?
Oh, well, let me see.

408
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,763
[Gasps] I don't see anything.

409
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:07,765
Well, it hurts.

410
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,768
Christ,
we're gonna be late.

411
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,774
Should we call up
to the room again?

412
00:26:16,774 --> 00:26:19,277
[Driver] He said he'd be
right down.

413
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:22,780
[Yawning]

414
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,783
Tired?
Oh, I'm exhausted.

415
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:28,786
I dreamt I was on set
all night.

416
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:33,791
I was just trying to get one shot,
and everything kept going wrong.

417
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:36,794
That's an anxiety dream.
Are you anxious about something?

418
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:38,796
I don't know. [Sighs]

419
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:42,300
Sometimes I wonder what the hell
I'm doing in this business.

420
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,803
It's all just one compromise
and disappointment after another.

421
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,306
I don't know if I have
the personality for it.

422
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,309
Sounds kind of like
an identity crisis.

423
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,312
[Laughs]
Yeah, maybe you're right.

424
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,815
Who am i?
What am I capable of?

425
00:26:57,815 --> 00:27:02,320
Maybe I should find a job teaching spanish
at a women's college somewhere.

426
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,323
How'd you get
into cinematography?

427
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:09,827
I'm not the cinematographer.

428
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:11,829
You're not?

429
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:15,333
No, I'm directing this movie.

430
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,835
How'd you get into directing?

431
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:22,640
[Engine idling]

432
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,643
[Operator] Your car is still waiting
for you, mr. Palomino.

433
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,645
Five minutes.
Okay, i'll tell him.

434
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,647
Bye.
[Water running]

435
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:34,152
They're downstairs. You go ahead.
I'm gonna take a taxi.

436
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,154
Okay.

437
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,156
[Water continues]

438
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,158
Uh, listen...

439
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:45,663
I had a lot of fun last night,
really, but I gotta tell you,

440
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:50,668
where I'm at right now
in my life, a relationship...

441
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,171
chad, hold on a second.
[Laughing]

442
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,174
Uh, this was just
a one-time deal.

443
00:27:56,174 --> 00:28:00,178
You know it, I know it.
You can cut the melodrama.

444
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,180
I just thought
you might want...

445
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,683
all I ask is that you don't
mention it to anyone.

446
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:09,687
That's not my style.
Good. That's good.

447
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:13,691
[Horn honking]

448
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:19,197
So, i'll see you
on the set.

449
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,199
Right.

450
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,701
[Footsteps, door opens, closes]

[Sighs]

452
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,706
[Horn honking]
Goddamn it.

453
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,718
[Brakes squeak]

454
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,723
[Nick] Hey, so what do you got
coming up after this?

455
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:49,227
Nick, I got two movies
right after yours.

456
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:53,731
One, I play a rapist that michelle pfeiffer
falls in love with.

457
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:58,236
The other one,
I play kind of a sexy...

458
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,239
serial killer that shacks up
with winona ryder.

459
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,242
That's great, man.

460
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:09,747
Yeah, I'm not into that hostess twinkie shit.
"Hostess twinkie"?

461
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,250
Hollywood shit, man.
You know, it's all fluff.

462
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,253
These are the kind of films
I wanna be doin'.

463
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,755
Hey, thanks, man.
Hey.

464
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,758
I gotta say, I'm really
glad you feel that way,

465
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,261
and I'm excited to be
working with you.

466
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,263
Yeah, me too.
You're a great director, man.

467
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:28,266
Your films
are totally whacked!

468
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,769
You know, I'm gonna be watching you, buddy,
like a hawk.

469
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:34,772
I wanna learn
from you, Nick.

470
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:36,774
I'm gonna pick your brain.

471
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:39,277
Good. Then you could
pick my nose.

472
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,280
[Laughing]

473
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,782
See what I mean?
You're whacked!

474
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,285
Yeah.
What are we waitin' here for?

475
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,788
Oh, waitin' on Nicole.
Nicole? She's tak...

476
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,790
what?

477
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,295
Probably takin' a shower
or something.

478
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:01,299
Hey, did anybody see that richard gere movie?
How was her shower scene in it?

479
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,801
- It was good.
- Really great.

480
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,809
[Exhaling]

481
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:14,812
[Hammering, crew chattering]
How boring.

482
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:17,815
I think we got nudity today.

483
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:20,818
It just says,
"ellen and damian kiss."

484
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:22,820
Well, it could be
a kiss with nudity.

485
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,323
[Crew chattering, phone ringing]
I like ellen.

486
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:29,327
She's my type.
Now, why is that?

487
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,330
She's, uh...
she's pretty.

488
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,834
She's smart.
She's kind of kooky. [Phone continues ringing]

489
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,837
Maybe i'll give her a part.

490
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:43,341
Yeah, I'm making my own movie pretty soon.

491
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,344
A feature.
Oh, yeah?

492
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:48,346
Brought the script.

493
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,849
Palomino is perfect for the lead.
[Sawing]

494
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:54,352
I'm gonna give it to him right during lunch.
[Sawing continues]

495
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,854
Maybe right after.
All right.

496
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:59,857
Yeah, I gotta be aggressive.
[Sawing continues]

497
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,360
Wanna shoot it?

498
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,862
[Caterer] Come and get it.
Sure.

499
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:07,865
Yeah? You ever shot anything before?

500
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:10,368
No.

501
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,370
All right.

502
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,372
You gotta start somewhere.

503
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,374
[Phone ringing]
[Woman] Good morning!

504
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:19,377
[Crew] Good morning.
Good morning.

505
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,879
[Nicole sighs] Look at these bags
under my eyes.

506
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:25,383
I can take care of that.

507
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,885
Does that work?

508
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:30,888
With skin?
It's gonna be great.
You just take it easy.

509
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:35,393
Jesus, what are you doing?
Shrinking tissue. That's what this stuff is for.

510
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,897
Let that sit for two minutes, pumpkin.
I'll be right back.

511
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:44,402
[Sighs] How'd you get here?
Oh, I took a taxi.

512
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,405
Oh, because we've been
waiting in front of your
apartment for half an hour.

513
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,407
Oh, god!
I'm sorry, Nick. I'm sorry.

514
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,911
I just... uh, something came up
and I forgot to call.

515
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,913
I feel like such an asshole.

516
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:59,417
You're just saying that
because you have preparation h
on your face.

517
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:04,922
Man, I never should have
gone out last night. I hate jazz.

518
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:07,925
God, I look terrible.

519
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:11,429
No, you don't.
Don't bullshit me, Nick.

520
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,931
I'm not.
You look beautiful.

521
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,935
[Footsteps]
Hey!

522
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:21,439
How did you get here,
Nicole?

523
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,941
I took a cab.

524
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:28,446
Oh, because we were wondering
how you got here.

525
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,452
Good, everybody's here.
We'll have a run-through
as soon as you guys are ready.

526
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,454
You got it, chief.

527
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:39,957
[Nick] Lorde, what are you doing?
Chad's ready for his makeup.

528
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:44,462
[Wanda] Okay, we're back in.
We are back. We are in.

529
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:49,967
Hold it down, people.
Hold it down! Actors working.

530
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:53,471
- Great shirt, wanda.
- Why, thank you, chad.

531
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,973
Okay, let's finish
working out this blocking.
Wolf!

532
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,976
- Hmm?
- What happened to your eye?

533
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,978
A little accident.

534
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:03,481
[Nick] You gonna be all right?
I think so.

535
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:07,485
Looks great, man.
Okay, Nicole is here
standing by the bed.

536
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,987
Chad, you're over there
by the chair. Okay.

537
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,990
And camera's close on ellen.
[Snaps fingers] first line.

538
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,993
I've always admired you
from afar.

539
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,997
Admired? That sounds...
rather professional.

540
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:21,999
Good. Okay, "professional,"
that's the cue.

541
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,502
Dolly comes in.
Damian, you come over to the bed. Right?

542
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:29,006
Scene continues.
Well, then, loved.
How does that sound?

543
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,009
Sounds like champagne talking.

544
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,012
I've loved you from the moment we met.

545
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,014
[Chad] Why didn't you tell me?

546
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,016
We were working together.
I didn't want anything to interfere.

547
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:43,020
God, and all this time
I thought...

548
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,022
then you kiss.

549
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,025
Don't do it now.
Okay, how's that feel?

550
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:51,529
Great. Nicole?
Good.

551
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,030
Wolf, any thoughts?
Nope.

552
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,032
I have a thought.

553
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:59,537
What if damian had
an eye patch like wolf?

554
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,540
Hmm, let me think
about that one, chad.

555
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,542
All right.
You're the genius.

556
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:09,046
Nick reve, living in oblivion,
scene six, take one! Let's shoot it!

557
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:11,549
One second, chad.
Wolf, you ready to shoot one?

558
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,051
I've been ready. Move aside.
[Chad] All right, wolfman!

559
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,054
[Grunting]
[Nick] Good. Okay, call it, wanda.

560
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,558
[Wanda] Camera, please.
All right, going for picture.

561
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,562
And lock it up!
And roll sound. Speed.

562
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,565
Roll camera.
Rolling. Scene six, take one.

563
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,567
[Nick]
And... action.

564
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:33,070
I've always admired you
from afar.

565
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,073
[Giggles] Admired?

566
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:39,076
That sounds rather professional.

567
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:43,080
Well, then, loved.
How does that sound?

568
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,082
Sounds like champagne talking.

569
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,587
[Nicole] Well, I've loved you
from the moment we met.

570
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:53,090
Then why didn't you
tell me? [Sighs]

571
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:58,596
We were working together.
I didn't want anything to interfere.

572
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:03,601
God...
and all this time...

573
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,103
I thought...

574
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,609
cut.

575
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,611
[Wanda]
That's a cut.

576
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:17,615
Very good. Not for camera.
Chad's completely out of my frame.

577
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:20,618
Yeah, what happened, buddy?
Did you forget your cue?
No, man.

578
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:24,622
I held back. I really feel it's something
that damian would do:

579
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,124
Hold back until
the last moment, you know?

580
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:29,126
Oh... I see.
Uh, how's that for you, wolf?

581
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,129
I don't care when he moves.
Just give me the fuckin' cue.

582
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:35,132
- Lone wolf!
- What line did he move on?

583
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:39,136
"Why didn't you tell me?"
Okay, "me." That'll be your new cue.

584
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,639
How's that feel for you, Nicole?
Oh, that's good.

585
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,641
Yeah, if that's
what chad wants.

586
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,143
Me, me, me.
That's the cue.

587
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:49,146
Shoot it!
One second, chad.

588
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:51,148
Come here, chad.

589
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,651
Okay, um...

590
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,653
chad...

591
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,657
how would you describe
this scene in one word?

592
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,659
It's great.
It's a great scene.

593
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,663
Okay. No, but I mean...
it's a love scene, right?

594
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,165
Definitely.
Right. Okay.

595
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,669
And these two people, they really love each other,
and we wanna see that.

596
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,672
Especially in the kiss.

597
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,175
I got it, chief.
All right. Nicole?

598
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:20,177
I understand, chief.
Good.

599
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:24,181
Call it, wanda. All right, going for picture.
Lock it up.

600
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:26,183
And roll sound.
Speed.

601
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:29,186
Roll camera. Rolling.
Scene six, take two.

602
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,190
Ellen, just push your...

603
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,694
and... action.

604
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,698
I've always admired you
from afar.

605
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,700
Admired?

606
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,203
That sounds...
rather professional.

607
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:50,207
[Dolly squeaking] Well, then, loved.
How does that sound?

608
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:52,710
Sounds like champagne talking.

609
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,715
I've loved you from the moment we met.

610
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,718
Then why didn't you tell me?

611
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:05,222
We were working together.
I didn't want anything to interfere.

612
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,225
God...

613
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,227
and all this time...

614
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,229
hmm.

615
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:20,237
And cut!

616
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:22,740
[Wanda] that's a cut.
[Nick] Very good. Wolf?

617
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,743
Chad missed his cue again.
The whole dolly's unusable.

618
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,747
Yeah, what happened there,
pal-o-mine-o-mino? [Chuckles]

619
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,249
I thought this time you were
gonna hold back until "me."

620
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:34,752
The more I thought about that,
it just didn't seem right.

621
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,754
You know,
and I'm thinkin'...

622
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:41,258
instead of comin' all
the way around the bed,

623
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:45,262
what if I just slip in here like this,

624
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,765
do the whole scene lying down?

625
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,769
I don't know.
That seems a little...

626
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,272
I'm just tryin' to throw out
ideas, get the creative
juices flowing.

627
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,274
- Nicole, how does that feel?
- [Chad clears throat]

628
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,277
Well... yeah,
I could turn to look at him,

629
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:02,279
but won't you be shooting
the back of my head?

630
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:05,783
Plus chad's completely
out of the light down there.

631
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,285
Hey, wolf, I don't care
about my face, man.
All right?

632
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:10,287
What I care about here
is the acting.

633
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:12,289
That's all I care about!
[Phone ringing]

634
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,793
It's your call, Nick.
His acting or his face?

635
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,796
For some reason,
I thought we can get both.

636
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:21,298
I thought that's what
we were trying to do here.

637
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,300
[Wolf] I'll have to set another light.

638
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,803
[Wanda] We're ahead of schedule, Nick.

639
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,807
I think we have a few moments
to set a light for mr. Palomino.

640
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,809
[Claps hands]
Good, let's do it.

641
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,812
Ellen, damian,
let's talk for a second.

642
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,815
[Wanda] We are going to pause
to set a little light,

643
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:41,318
and then we are going
to rush again right away. [Snaps fingers]

644
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,320
How long, wolf?

645
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,322
Wolf?

646
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,828
[Nick] Okay.

647
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,832
Let's just take a moment
and make sure we know what's going on here, right?

648
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:58,836
These two people, they've loved each other
for years, right?

649
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:01,839
Each of them not knowing
the other was in love with them, right?

650
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,843
And tonight, in this little room,
it all comes out.

651
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,846
It's like...
it's like a dam bursting.

652
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,349
Does that make sense?
Nicole?

653
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,852
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
It makes perfect sense.

654
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,855
I just, you know...
I haven't found it yet. I'll get it though.

655
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,857
Okay. What about you, chad?
I'm there, man.

656
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,861
I got the dam bursting,
the river, everything. You watch.

657
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,864
Changing the blocking's really
gonna open things up for me.

658
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,867
[Wanda] We're ready, Nick.
Okay, good.

659
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,869
Let's go.
[Woman] What are you talking about?

660
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,872
[Nick] Okay, here we go.
Number one.

661
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,876
[Wanda] Okay, we're gonna go very soon.
Have we done last looks?

662
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,879
Mr. Palomino is being checked
[Nick] ready? Don't lose the energy.

663
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,381
[Yawning] Stay in the scene.
Good.

664
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:46,884
Call it, wanda.
Lock it up. And roll sound.

665
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,386
- Speed.
- Roll camera.

666
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:53,390
Rolling. Scene six,
take three.

667
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:57,895
[Nick] Okay, dam bursting.
And... action.

668
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:01,398
I've always admired you from afar.

669
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,400
Admired?

670
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,905
That sounds...
rather... professional.

671
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,408
Well, then, loved.
How does that sound?

672
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:14,411
It sounds like champagne talking.

673
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:18,916
I've loved you from the moment we met.

674
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,418
Why didn't you tell me?

675
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:25,422
We were working together.
I didn't... I didn't want anything to interfere.

676
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:27,925
Nick, um... you know, this...
[laughs]

677
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,428
I'm turned all the way around.
I didn't... is that what you...
what's the problem?

678
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:34,431
[Nicole] sorry, can we cut?
Cut. That's a cut.

679
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,934
Damn it!

680
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,937
That was a good one.
I know. L...

681
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,941
I'm sorry, but this feels
really... awkward,

682
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,943
me turning all the way
around like this.

683
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,446
Yeah. You know, chad, I don't think the lying
on the bed is quite working.

684
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,448
Let's try one with
the original blocking.

685
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,452
What is that? Been so many changes.
Could somebody help me?

686
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:59,456
Cue for the original
blocking is "professional."

687
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:01,959
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

688
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,961
Right away, back to one.
Call it, wanda.

689
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,463
And picture's up.
Lock it up. Roll sound.

690
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:09,967
You know, actually, Nick...
could I have a moment? Just...

691
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,469
is that all right?
Of course, Nicole. Are you kidding me?

692
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,472
Hold the roll, wanda.
Holding the roll.

693
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:20,477
[Indistinct whispering,
chattering]

694
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:25,482
[Whispering continues]

695
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:27,985
What's the cue?
It's right there.

696
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,989
Okay, and did he print anything yet?
No.

697
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,492
[Sniffing]

698
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:40,497
Mmm. Someone smells
very, very good here.

699
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,002
[Sighs]
Okay.

700
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:50,507
[Wanda] Listen, you do your job,
and i'll do mine, okay?

701
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:53,510
[Indistinct walkie-talkie
transmission] Ready, Nick.

702
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,512
Okay.

703
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:58,015
Call it, wanda.
All right, going for picture.

704
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,017
Lock it up.
And roll sound.

705
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:03,020
Speed. Roll camera.

706
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,022
Rolling. Scene six,
take four.

707
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:09,526
And...
[chad] Nick!

708
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:12,029
I just had a great idea.
[Wanda] Hold the roll.

709
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,033
Hold the roll. Nobody move.
What is it, chad?
Stop me if I'm out of line.

710
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,536
She says, "admired from afar."

711
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:25,042
So doesn't it make sense to see
damian up close, her "afar"?

712
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,044
Now watch me.

713
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,047
We start on a close-up of me, right?

714
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,550
She declares her love,
she comes to me,

715
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,553
and she steps into this
beautiful two-shot...

716
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:38,555
that you and the wolfmeister
have set up here.

717
00:42:38,555 --> 00:42:42,059
What do you think, wolf?
I don't like it. It's ellen's scene.

718
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,062
[Nick] it sort of makes sense.
You did it, man. It's in the writing.

719
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:51,068
I'd have to relight.
We are ahead of schedule, Nick,
if that means anything to you.

720
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:54,571
Let's do it.

721
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:57,074
Get me a tweenie over here,
with diffusion. Okay, everyone.

722
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,577
Please stand by.
We are pausing briefly to set one little light.

723
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:03,080
And then we are going again
right away.

724
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,583
Stand-in, please, for mr. Palomino.
Oh, i'll do it.

725
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:09,086
Get the fuckin' light!

726
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:13,090
He's a bit of a prima donna,
but Nick is working... [crew chattering]

727
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,593
[Phone ringing]
That's cool.

728
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,596
[Ringing continues] Okay, thursday.
That's good.

729
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:21,598
[Script] I'm going to the ballet
next week.

730
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:26,103
Your hair could use some work.
Why don't you finish me on the set?

731
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,106
All right, I will.
Sugar? Just a bit.

732
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:33,110
He doesn't give a shit about me.
[Phone ringing]

733
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:37,614
You like jazz?
Very much.

734
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:42,119
We should go hear some tonight.
That'd be nice.

735
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,624
[Sighs] It's going well, I think.
Don't you think?

736
00:43:47,624 --> 00:43:49,626
Very well.
[Pouring coffee]

737
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:52,129
What time do you think we'll be finished?
Early, I hope.

738
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,132
I'm going to a jazz club tonight.
Really?

739
00:43:55,632 --> 00:44:00,637
So am i.
He's wonderful, isn't he?

740
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:03,140
So natural,
just like air.

741
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,642
Chad?

742
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:09,646
I wonder what his sign is.
Do you know, Nicole?

743
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:12,149
No, I don't know his sign, but...

744
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:18,155
I think his moon is in uranus.
[Laughs, coughing]

745
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,158
You don't have to be nasty.
Oh, I'm sorry.

746
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,662
Yo, wolfman, is this my new mark?

747
00:44:25,662 --> 00:44:28,665
Until you fuckin' change it.

748
00:44:28,665 --> 00:44:31,668
Where's my fuckin' eye patch?
Hey, lester!

749
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:33,670
Anybody seen my eye patch?

750
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,173
Admired? That sounds rather professional.
Hey, chad.

751
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,676
Hey. Hey. I'm bob.
I'm lighting the show.

752
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:43,180
Chad palomino, actor.
[Wolf] where's my goddamn eye patch?

753
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,683
Yeah, I know.
Uh... hey, what's your name?

754
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,687
Maurice. Maurice!
Hey, maurice chevalier!

755
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:53,690
Any relation? Probably not, huh?
Hey, chad, I'm...

756
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,693
smokin' crew, guys.
Thanks. Hey, thanks.

757
00:44:56,693 --> 00:45:01,198
I wrote a script,
and I thought you might want to take a...

758
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,701
hey, bill, you see the top
of that light there?

759
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:07,204
Uh... yeah.

760
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,707
Bring that down about three feet.

761
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:15,212
[Wolf] Anybody seen my eye patch?
[Phone ringing]

762
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,217
The dailies from last night
looked really...

763
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,719
[exhales] You look incredible, Nicole.

764
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,721
Hey, do you want to...
[clears throat]

765
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:28,725
Nicole, would you care to have a drink with me,
you know, tonight?

766
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:33,230
I just wanted to... we could talk about...
oh!

767
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,732
I'm sorry, Nick.
Oh, that's okay, Nicole.

768
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:39,736
I was just splashing
a little water on my face.
Oh.

769
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:43,740
Uh, listen, i...
it's going pretty well, right?

770
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,244
Is it? I don't know.
Something feels off.

771
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,247
Yeah, you seem a little tense.
Do I?

772
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,249
Don't worry about it.

773
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,752
Take the attention off yourself and put it on chad.
Work off him a little more.

774
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:58,755
Okay, i'll try that.
Good.

775
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:02,259
I know he's no olivier
or anything, but...

776
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,762
he's got something though.
Don't you think he's got
like a natural presence?

777
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:08,765
Yeah.
He's very natural.

778
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,767
Like air. [Laughs]

779
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:16,273
So... Is there anything else
I could help you with? [Phone ringing]

780
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,276
Uh... actually, there is.

781
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,279
Could you maybe ask him
to brush his teeth?

782
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,532
Sure. [Woman calling]
Nicole? Nicole?

783
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,285
Please get Nicole
to wardrobe.

784
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,287
[Walkie-talkie]
Yeah?

785
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,789
My eye's killing me.

786
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,791
Put your eye patch on.

787
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,793
I lost it.

788
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,297
Is that little light set yet?

789
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:43,300
The light was set about ten minutes ago.

790
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,305
Uh, get the a-team in here right away:
Nick, Nicole and mr. Palomino.

791
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,307
Why didn't you tell me?

792
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:54,811
Hey, you're not worried about the time,
I'm not worried about the time.

793
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:58,315
Oh, I am very worried about the time.
Oh, I know you are.

794
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,817
What is that supposed to mean?
What do you think?

795
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,819
I don't know what it means!
Yes, you do.

796
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,322
No, I don't!
I haven't done anything!
The hell you don't.

797
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,324
Wanda, please,
you have to understand...
why are you accusing me?

798
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,826
You don't understand me!
You don't even care!
I don't understand you?

799
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:12,829
All I do is take care of you constantly!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

800
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,832
Hey! What the fuck, wanda? Huh?

801
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:19,836
I'm trying to shoot an intimate
scene here. I don't need a lot
of tension on set, all right?

802
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:21,838
Damian,
you on your new mark?

803
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,840
Good.
All right.

804
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,842
Close-up of damian,
ellen in the back...

805
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:29,346
chad, what are you doing?
Hey, that's my fuckin' eye patch!

806
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,349
Can I borrow it, wolf?
Nick, it just feels right.

807
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,852
I've got this guy now!
No, chad, it doesn't work.

808
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:38,355
You're wrong, man.
I'm gonna fight you on this one.

809
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,358
Hey, that's my eye patch,
and I don't want anyone else
wearing it. It's insanitary!

810
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,361
Fine! I'll get my own eye patch!

811
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:48,865
Nick, send someone out, get me an eye patch.
I'll pay for it myself.

812
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,867
[Wanda whispering]
Get an eye patch for mr. Palomino.

813
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,869
[Nick] Chad, let me talk
to you for a second.

814
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,372
Look, I didn't want to say this
in front of wolf, but, uh,

815
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:59,376
it makes you look a little... gay.

816
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,878
Really?
A little bit.

817
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,880
Jesus.

818
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,387
Oh... you're right.

819
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,890
Good call. Thanks, buddy.
Sure.

820
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,893
[Wanda] We're ready, Nick.
Uh, wolf, you need a rehearsal?

821
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,895
Let's just fucking shoot it.

822
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:21,398
El lobo!

823
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,900
[Howling] Call it, wanda.
Lock it up.

824
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,403
And roll sound.
Speed.

825
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:30,407
Roll camera. Rolling.
Scene six, take four.

826
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,910
[Nick] Everybody, keep the energy up.
And... action.

827
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,413
I've always admired you
from afar.

828
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:39,916
Admired?
Sounds rather professional.

829
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,920
Well, then, loved.
How does that sound?

830
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,423
Sounds like champagne talking.

831
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:50,927
I've loved you from the moment we met.

832
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:53,930
Why didn't you tell me?

833
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:59,936
We were working together.
I didn't want anything to interfere. God!

834
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:02,439
Cut. That's a cut.
[Nicole] Sorry, Nick.

835
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:06,943
Sorry. I don't know why
I did that. I'm sorry.

836
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:10,947
Nick, can I talk to you for a second?

837
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,950
What?

838
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,453
Two seconds, wanda.
Everybody stand by.

839
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,456
All right, momentary delay.
Everyone stand by.

840
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,458
We're gonna go again right away.

841
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,461
Uh, excuse me, ellen.
You were a tad low on that.

842
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,963
Okay, i'll bring it up.

843
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,466
Actually, could I listen to the take before?

844
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,468
Sure.

845
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:36,973
Here it is.
It's coming up right now. [Tape rewinding]

846
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,477
[Tape] I've loved you from the moment we met.
Why didn't you tell...

847
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,979
chad, just one second, okay?
Talk to me. What's going on?

848
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,482
I cannot act with that woman!
Shh.

849
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,984
I know that she's a friend of yours,
but she cannot act worth a shit!

850
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,988
I'm giving her everything!
Did you see that whole thing
I just did with the hair?

851
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:56,493
That was great.
I came up with that on my own!
I thought it would help her!

852
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,495
Cut.
[Tape beeps] Thanks.

853
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:00,497
[Chad over microphone]
She's giving me nothing! Just a second.

854
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:05,502
I'm outta here! Why the hell did you cast her?
She sucked in that richard gere movie!

855
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:10,507
[Nick] you're right. She's not the best actress
in the world. I can see that.

856
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,509
But you've gotta help me out here, chad.
All right?

857
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:16,513
I'm asking you, please.
Work with me, all right?

858
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,515
[Chad] Let me tell you something, man.

859
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,518
Do you know why she took
a cab this morning?

860
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:26,022
[Nick] Something came up.
No, she was in my hotel room,

861
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:29,526
and she didn't want you
to know about it, okay?

862
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,528
Now, I'm sorry it had
to come out like this,

863
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,531
but I told her this morning,
I said, "thanks a lot.

864
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,534
"I had a lot of fun
last night.

865
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,536
"But let's get something
straight here, baby.

866
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:43,039
This is a one-time deal."

867
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:47,043
She didn't want to hear that.
She wanted more.

868
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:51,548
You see what I'm saying?
It's rejection.

869
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,050
Okay.
Hey, i'll talk to her, all right?

870
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:58,054
I'm here for you, man.
I appreciate that, man, because, you know,

871
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:01,057
you're one of the best actors
I've ever worked with.

872
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:05,061
All right? So, let's just...
we can do this, all right?

873
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:09,566
[Wanda] okay, here we go.
Director and actor are on set.
First positions please.

874
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:14,070
Nicole, listen...
Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't working.

875
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:18,575
I-I-I apologize.
Chad, I apologize to you too.

876
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:22,078
I just... I'm completely
unfocused here.

877
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:26,583
I think what we need to do
is to just loosen up the scene somehow.

878
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:30,086
What would you
like to do?

879
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:35,091
I was wondering... maybe could we try improvising
the scene a little bit?

880
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,594
More along the lines
of what chad's been doing.

881
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:41,598
Maybe that will help me find something.
That's a fantastic idea.

882
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,100
What do you think?
That's the only way I can work.

883
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,604
Let's take it apart. Let's cut it loose.
Good.

884
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,607
And we'll shoot it,
all right?

885
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,610
Hell, why not?
Roll that motherfuckin' camera, wolfie.

886
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,612
Kiss my ass!
Yeah!

887
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,614
All right!
Now we're making a fuckin' movie!

888
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,866
Call it, wanda.
Okay, lock it up.

889
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,118
Going for picture.
And roll sound. Look alive.

890
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,120
Speed.
Roll camera. Rolling!

891
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,623
Scene six, take five.

892
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,125
Action!

893
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,629
I've always admired you
from afar.

894
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,131
Have you?

895
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:17,634
That's...
wow.

896
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,636
That's incredible.

897
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,138
Admired?

898
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:26,142
Sounds kind of professional though, doesn't it?
Admired?

899
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:31,648
You're right.
How does, um... despised sound?

900
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,652
Great.
What does it mean? [Laughs]

901
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:41,658
Well, it's sort of like I think that you are
a slimy piece of shit.

902
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,661
That sounds like champagne talking.
Oh, no, no, no, it's not.

903
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:48,665
It's not.
I really do think you are a piece of shit.

904
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,668
No, you don't.
You love me.

905
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,671
Oh, no.
The fuck I do.

906
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,674
I can't stand looking at you.

907
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:01,678
[Chad] Then I guess I have nothing to say.

908
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,180
No, no, no, no. no.

909
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:09,185
I think you have a lot
more to say, damian.

910
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:12,689
Well, I'm a little surprised
that you feel this way, ellen,

911
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,691
because i'd always thought
you had admired me.

912
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:17,193
No, no, no,
that's not what I meant.

913
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:20,196
I think that you should tell everyone...

914
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:24,200
what you just told Nick behind the set.

915
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,203
Hey, wait a second.
This isn't part of the scene.

916
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,706
[Nicole] No, say it anyway.
Say it anyway, damian.

917
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,708
The reason that this scene isn't working...

918
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:36,212
is because you and I slept together
last night, right?

919
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,715
Did everyone hear that?

920
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,718
I fucked chad last night!

921
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,220
This is exactly what I was trying to tell you.
It's about rejection!

922
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,223
[Laughing]
Oh, you fucking asshole.

923
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,226
You think I give a fuck about you?

924
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:53,730
I was there to get laid.
And even that was a joke.

925
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,732
[Chad] You're really starting
to fuckin' piss me off!

926
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:59,235
Oh, I am? Does that mean
you're not gonna wiggle around on the bed anymore...

927
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:02,739
or stroke my hair all
soft and concerned...

928
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:06,242
or kiss me like a soap-opera-acting
piece of shit? Fuck!

929
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:09,245
- Hey, hey, hey! All right!
- Come on! I'll kick the fuckin' shit outta you!

930
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,247
[Nick] hey, cut that... cut, cut, cut!
[Nicole] fucking loser!

931
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:13,500
[Nick] I think we can
hold it right there.

932
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,253
Yeah, you bet we can hold it right there!
Wanda, call me a cab!

933
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,255
Hold on, chad. Just try and calm down.
Fuck you, man!

934
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,257
Hey, calm down.
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

935
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:23,760
First of all, I'm outta here!
This movie's bullshit!

936
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,763
Hey, one second there, chad.
No reason for hostility, okay?

937
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,765
Why don't you shut up,
you fuckin' loser.

938
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,267
The only reason
I took a part in this movie...

939
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,772
is because someone said that you were tight
with Quentin Tarantino!

940
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:40,276
You're nowhere, man!
Do you want to go?

941
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,278
Go! All right?

942
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:45,782
I am so sick of your shit,
you hostess twinkie motherfucker.

943
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,784
[Chad] What did you say?

944
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,286
You heard me.
Say it again!

945
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:55,291
You hostess twinkie motherfucker.

946
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,296
Ow! [Gasps]

947
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:04,300
[Nicole screaming]

948
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,804
Goddamn it.
Everyone, just stop it! Get off...

949
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,306
Nicole, get off!
Nicole, get off of him!

950
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:15,311
Come on! Get off of him!
Ow! God! Oh! [Nicole grunting]

951
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,313
I'm gonna kick your ass, chad.

952
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:22,318
[Wanda gasps]
Wolf! Oh, god! Oh, god.

953
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:24,821
[Panting, gasping]
Oh!

954
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,825
[Wanda gasping]
Oh, god. Wolf.

955
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,328
[Chad gasps]
[Nicole grunts]

956
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,331
Come here!
I'll kick your fuckin' ass!

957
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:38,835
Hey, hey, hey!
You wanna pick my brain, huh? [Gasping]

958
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:42,839
This is how I direct
twinkie motherfuckers like you!

959
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,341
You scumbag!
Come on, i'll kick your ass! [Chad groaning]

960
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,846
You wanna pick my brain?
Hold it, tiger! Get off!
Let go! Easy now!

961
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,849
[Voice quivering]
Chad.

962
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,852
[Nick] Have a nice flight home, buddy!
[Wanda] fucking killed him!

963
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,854
The only reason I cast you
is because of your name!

964
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:01,357
Yeah, get him outta here!
Take him back to his hotel!
[Wanda] shit!

965
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,360
[Nicole] Asshole.

966
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,364
Nicole, are you okay?
Don't touch me.

967
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:14,537
Can I help, guys?
Oh, shit, my back. I pulled my back, bob.

968
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:22,545
It's calledtsunami.
A japanese tidal wave hits new york.

969
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,548
You're an ex-navy seal frogman.
You're working undercover. You save the city.

970
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,551
You'd be perfect for the lead.
My number's there. [Engine revs]

971
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:31,554
You call me, I call you.
Either way, it's been great working with you!

972
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:36,059
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

973
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:40,063
You were great in that richard gere movie.
Shut up.

974
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,066
You are no different than he is.
You lie! You're deceitful!
I'm not lying!

975
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:48,071
Christ, I tell everybody
how great you are.

976
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,574
I've got nothing but respect
and admiration for you.

977
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:55,078
Christ, Nick, now you're doing
your own fucking script.

978
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,080
[Sighs]

979
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:03,086
Why do you think I wrote it?
I have no idea.

980
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,588
It's about you.

981
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,092
It's how I feel about you.

982
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,596
Did you get a bump on your head,
Nicky, 'cause you're talking like an idiot!

983
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:17,100
[Sighing] No.

984
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:22,105
Nicole, I've loved you
since the day we met.

985
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,612
Why didn't you tell me?

986
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:34,117
Because I didn't want anything
to interfere with us working together.

987
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,621
[Sighs] Oh, god.

988
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,127
And all this time
I thought...

989
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,634
[gasps] [Water running]

990
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,139
Oh, god.

991
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:02,145
[Water continues]

992
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,147
[Door closes]

993
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,653
Don't go out that door!
Why not?

994
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,656
Because it's part of the set, goddamn it!
Now go around.

995
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:17,160
Next time.
This is an emergency!

996
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,162
[Sighs] Has ellen arrived yet?
[Crew chattering]

997
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,665
[Walkie-talkie] check.
Well, get her into wardrobe right away!

998
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,667
Scene five?
No, scene six.

999
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,171
Scene five has been postponed.
I'm not gonna tell you again!

1000
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,674
Mr. Palomino isnotworking today.

1001
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,178
What are you talking about?
Where's my goddamn smoke machine?

1002
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:41,184
[Farts] Oh, god.

1003
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,687
[Sighs] Oh!

1004
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:49,192
What do you want?
[Stammering] I gotta use the bathroom, man.

1005
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,695
- It's really an emergency.
- Fuckin' knock!

1006
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,198
You're right.

1007
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:59,702
One of these days, I'm going
to punch somebody in the balls!

1008
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,205
[Woman] straighten up.
[Nick] you're not gonna believe this, Nicole.

1009
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,208
Just as we pull up in front of your apartment,
palomino tells me...

1010
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,711
he is suddenly so sick he can't
possibly work today.

1011
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:12,215
God. Was it something he ate?
Straighten up, please.

1012
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,717
I don't know.
Can he work tomorrow?

1013
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,719
Turn to your right.
Don't know that either.

1014
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,222
But you know what?
I'm not going to worry about it.

1015
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,724
I had this dream last night,
I was on set.

1016
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:26,229
You were in it, and another woman,
somebody older.

1017
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,731
Anyway, everything was going wrong...

1018
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,733
and no matter how hard
I tried to keep things together...

1019
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,735
the more they just fell apart.

1020
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,737
You know what that dream
was telling me, Nicole?

1021
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,739
That I just have
to roll with it.

1022
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,242
That's what I'm going to do today.
I am rolling with it.

1023
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,245
So we shoot the dream sequence.
[Clears throat]

1024
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:45,248
Hey, tito, man, you look great!
I feel like shit!

1025
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,250
No, no, no, you look good,
really.

1026
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,253
Hey, thank you so much
for coming in on such short notice.

1027
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:54,757
This is, ah, Nicole. She's playing ellen.
Hi. Toto, is it?

1028
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,759
Tito.

1029
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:00,263
Oh, I'm sorry.
Um, so listen.

1030
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,266
If there's anything I can do for you to...
you just let me know.

1031
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:07,770
Put a stool in the bathroom.
[Phone ringing]

1032
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,772
Don't move, I'll be right back.
Okay.

1033
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,775
Tito, tito, your costume length...
did I just offend him?

1034
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,778
Why, what'd you say?
"Short notice."

1035
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:19,782
Please, that was nothing.
My god, I'm the one
who called him "toto."

1036
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,785
You know, I am so out of it,
I dreamt I was on the set
last night too.

1037
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,787
Yeah?
Yep.

1038
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:28,291
You were in the dream.
Was I freaking out?

1039
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,294
[Laughs] Actually you were.

1040
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,296
Great.
I freak out in your dream.
I freak out in my dream.

1041
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,299
No wonder
I'm fucking exhausted.

1042
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,301
[Crew chattering]

1043
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:42,305
Nick?
Yeah?

1044
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:45,808
Nothing.
[Laughs]

1045
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:48,811
All right, guys.
Special effects today. Could be kind of fun.

1046
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,813
Who knows how
to work this baby?

1047
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,816
It's the old t160.
I used it once in '85.

1048
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,319
Damn. '85.
What's this?

1049
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,821
That's where the gas go.
Nah, that's where the oil go.

1050
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,823
Is it?
I'm pretty sure.

1051
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,326
How do you know?
No, he's right. It's coming back now.

1052
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,328
I'm gonna let you handle this, bob.
This is your baby.

1053
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,830
Les, if he needs any help,
give him a hand. Word.

1054
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,833
Okay, guys, we're all workin'
together today.

1055
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,838
Yeah, it's comin' back now.
It's like ridin' a bike.

1056
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:20,843
T160, 1985.
[Nick] Anybody seen wanda?

1057
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:24,347
1985, t160.
Wanda? Way to go, bob!

1058
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:27,350
[Crew chattering]

1059
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,352
How we doin', wanda?
Not good.

1060
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,354
Not bad, but not good.

1061
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,857
We have to finish this scene
today and do scene 31.

1062
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,360
Scene 31? Today?
Yeah.

1063
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,862
I don't even have my notes.
I left my notebook at home.

1064
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,864
Nobody told me we were doing scene 31.
I'll send someone...

1065
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,866
to your apartment
and they'll pick up the notes.

1066
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,868
Send someone to my apartment
to get my red notebook.
It's underneath the bed.

1067
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,871
Oh, fine. All right.
Okay. It's taken care of. Thank you.

1068
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:52,875
Hey, bob, get that smoke machine cranked up, buddy.
I want a lot of smoke today.

1069
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:56,379
We're smokin'. All right.
We're lit. The smoke machine's under control.

1070
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,882
We're ready to go.
Yeah, but what about the dolly?

1071
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,885
Hey, just need to see a little run-through
and we're all set.

1072
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:06,389
I'm gonna make your job
easy today, wanda. Hmm.

1073
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,892
Wandaful, wandaful,
wandaful. [Laughs]

1074
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:14,397
[Crew chattering] Mmm. I sure am glad
you wore that perfume.

1075
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:18,401
Hey, don't worry
about palomino.

1076
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:23,406
I'll take you to that jazz club tonight, yes.
Oh, I can't tonight.

1077
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:27,410
I promised i'd visit chad.
He's extremely ill. Oh.

1078
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:31,414
[Phone rings, crew chatters]
By the way, my eye's much better.

1079
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,916
Yeah?
[Sighs] Yeah.

1080
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,918
Listen, wolf, come here.

1081
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,921
[Sighs]

1082
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:43,426
I know this may not be the
best time to tell you this,

1083
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:48,931
but our relationship is going nowhere.
What do you mean?

1084
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:54,437
Please don't take this personally,
because I care for you, wolf. I really do.

1085
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,440
But I've been feeling
this way for quite awhile,

1086
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,945
and I really just think
that it's best if we just end it.

1087
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,948
Okay?

1088
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,951
Okay.
I think it's better.

1089
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,954
So do i.
Well, good.

1090
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,458
Yeah. Sure.
So we're still friends?

1091
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,461
Oh, well, great. Because, I mean,
we have to work together,

1092
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:21,464
and I don't think that
it has to be unpleasant.

1093
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,466
No, no.

1094
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,969
Well, give me a hug.

1095
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,971
[Sighs]

1096
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,975
You are a real special guy, wolf.
[Phone rings]

1097
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,478
Thanks.

1098
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,480
[Nick] you're gonna have to put the microphone forward.
Don't you hear that?

1099
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,485
Oh. Okay.
Can you hear me?

1100
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,987
[Wanda] I'd like to get the a-team
in here, please:

1101
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,990
Um, ellen and Nick
and mr. Tito.

1102
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:51,494
Everyone pay attention.
We are rehearsing scene six.
[Steam hisses]

1103
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:56,499
I want it absolutely quiet.
Director working with actors.
[Singes arm]

1104
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,001
Okay, listen up,
here's the shot.

1105
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:03,506
We start wide with ellen absolutely still
in the middle of the frame.

1106
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,008
Okay? You with me, wolf?
Yeah.

1107
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,011
What happened to your eye?
Nothing. It's just sensitive today.

1108
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,013
Can you see?
Of course I can see!

1109
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:16,519
Okay. Ellen is standing
still and the smoke is flowing in.

1110
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:20,022
And your first line?
"I am so hungry."

1111
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,024
Good. That's
your cue, tito.

1112
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:25,027
All right,
then you come in, and you circle her once.

1113
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:28,030
You hold that apple out,
just beyond her reach.
You're reaching for it.

1114
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,533
Good, and you're
staring at her hard. Harder.

1115
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:35,037
Good. Stop right there.
All right. Can we get a mark, please?

1116
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:38,541
All right, then we dolly in
with a medium shot.

1117
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:41,544
What do you think?
It should be hand-held.

1118
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:44,046
[Sighs] No, I think
it's better on the dolly.

1119
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,549
Nick, do I see him?
[Nick] no. You just see the apple.

1120
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:50,553
Tito, after that dolly in,
give me a little laugh there
at the end.

1121
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,556
A little laugh?
Big, little, whatever you feel like doing.

1122
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,558
Okay?
All right?

1123
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,561
Good. Let's shoot one.
Call it, wanda.

1124
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:02,064
Okay, here we go.
The dream sequence is up.

1125
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,567
Action
on the smoke machine. [Engine running]

1126
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:08,571
Okay, lock it up.
Here we go. Roll sound. Speed.

1127
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,073
Roll camera.
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

1128
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,576
Bob, could we get a little more smoke?
Is that possible?

1129
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,579
Oh, sure.
[Nick] all right, good.
Call it, wanda.

1130
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,581
[Wanda] and roll sound.
Speed.
Roll camera.

1131
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,083
Rolling.
Scene six, take one.

1132
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,588
[Nick]
And... action!

1133
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,090
I am so hungry.

1134
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,092
[Hinges squeak]

1135
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,608
Cut! That's a cut.
Nick, comments?

1136
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,110
Yeah, just a couple.

1137
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,613
Okay, that was, uh...
that was good.

1138
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:54,116
Tito, that was good, man,really.
You didn't feel like laughing?

1139
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,118
I laughed.
Oh. Okay, I guess I missed it.

1140
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,621
You can make it bigger.
All right?

1141
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:03,125
And, ellen, uh...
maybe a little more tension
when you see him.

1142
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:08,130
I thought I didn't see him.
Right. Maybe you see him a little bit.

1143
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,633
All right, wait,
do I see him or not?

1144
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,636
You see him.
Okay. Okay. Then what is the tension?

1145
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:17,139
I mean, who is toto?
It's tito.

1146
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,643
What did I say?
Oh, my god, I'm sorry. "Toto."

1147
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:26,148
Tito, I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm doing that.
Ellen, let's concentrate.

1148
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,651
Remember, tomorrow
you're marrying damian.

1149
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,153
You're a little anxious,
and you have this dream.

1150
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:36,158
Let's call it an anxiety dream.
And tito represents the anxiety.
Okay?

1151
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,661
Sounds pretty simple,
right? All right. Let's just try it.

1152
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,664
And, uh, bob, let's really
have some smoke on this one.

1153
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,666
All right?
Okay, more smoke.

1154
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,168
Good! Let's everybody
just relax. This is the one right here.

1155
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,171
I still think
it should be hand-held.

1156
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,674
Yeah, well, I don't want it hand-held.
I want it on the dolly.

1157
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,676
Where's my notebook, wanda?
It's on its way.

1158
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,178
All right. Call it, wanda.
All right, and roll sound.

1159
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,180
Speed.
Roll camera.

1160
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,182
Rolling.
Scene six, take two.

1161
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,686
Action!

1162
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,189
I am so hungry.

1163
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,191
[Hinges squeak]

1164
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,206
[Nick] Cut!
[Wanda] That's a cut.

1165
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,709
Nick, again?
Yes.

1166
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,711
[Wanda] All right, we're
going again right away.

1167
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:32,214
Okay, ellen, good. I think
you're on to something here.
Good?

1168
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,217
I'm sorry,
something's not right.
This all feels fake to me.

1169
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:38,220
It's not fake!
It's real!

1170
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,723
Just remember, you really
want that apple, okay?

1171
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,225
Tito, I still think
we could see more
of a laugh at the end.

1172
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,227
What kind of laugh?

1173
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:48,230
Just a laugh.
Show me.

1174
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:52,234
Oh. Okay, uh...
[exhales] [Walkie-talkie, indistinct]

1175
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:56,238
I'm thinking maybe something like this.
[Laughing]

1176
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,741
[Sighs]
Something like that.

1177
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,744
All right?
Now remember, tito, ellen, this is a dream.

1178
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,746
It doesn't have
to make sense.

1179
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,749
A laugh right there could
heighten our sense of, uh...

1180
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,251
anxiety.

1181
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:11,754
Exactly. Wolf,
how was that for you?

1182
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,756
I still think
it should be hand-held.

1183
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,758
Goddamn it!
It's not going to be!

1184
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,761
I want it on the dolly!
So why don't you just forget about it?

1185
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,763
And, bob, what the fuck
is with that smoke, man?

1186
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:24,266
You got a couple of hamsters
in there blowing smoke rings
for christ's sake?

1187
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:28,270
The left septic valve wasn't
open. I got it now. You're
gonna see some smoke now.

1188
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:32,775
Okay, good. All right.
Call it, wanda. Uh, and, lock it up.

1189
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,777
Nick, I need to talk to you for a minute.
What?

1190
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,279
In private.

1191
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,281
Okay,
release the lockup,

1192
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:43,035
and everyone stand by.
Yo, bob, you still ain't getting no smoke, man.

1193
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:46,789
I really don't like being
spoken to like this, Nick.
I don't like your attitude.

1194
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,291
I don't have an attitude.
The hell you don't!

1195
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,795
Every time I ask you to do
something, it's "no, no, no,
hand-held." I'm sick of it!

1196
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:56,298
I hired you to do a job.
If you're not going to do it,
let me know right now.

1197
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:59,301
[Crew chattering]
Nick... [sniffling]

1198
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:03,305
I'm...
I'm sorry, Nick.

1199
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:08,811
[Sighs]
I'm just going through some
really heavy shit right now.

1200
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,814
What do you mean?
I can't really talk about it,

1201
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:16,819
but it's pretty heavy.
Personal?

1202
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:25,828
Personal, professional
and emotional.

1203
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,832
It's really doing
a number on me, man.

1204
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,835
Now you're telling me
that you're gonna fire me.
I can't handle it.

1205
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:37,339
I never said that.
Wolf, I'm not gonna fire you.
You're doing a great job.

1206
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,342
Am i?
Yeah, man.

1207
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,846
I don't know what i'd do without you.
You've got a great eye.

1208
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,849
I just hope it's not the one
under that eye patch. [Laughs]

1209
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:52,855
Hey, listen, wolf.
Let me tell you something I've learned. All right?

1210
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,358
Sometimes you just have
to roll with things, you know?

1211
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:02,364
You're right.
Yeah, so just, just, just roll with it, man.

1212
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,366
It'll be okay.

1213
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,370
Thanks, bro.

1214
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,874
That's where the oil goes.
No, it's where the gas goes.

1215
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,376
I'm tellin' you, bob,
that's where the oil go.

1216
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,879
Lester, don't you think bob knows
where the oil goes?

1217
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:21,383
I don't remember
using oil in '85.

1218
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,385
[Wanda]
That's a hard one.

1219
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:26,889
Maybe that's where both the oil
and the gas go.

1220
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:31,393
[Crew chattering]

1221
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:35,397
I-I think he's right.
I think he is too.

1222
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,901
Three parts gas,
one part oil.

1223
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,904
[Nick] we're all set now.
Okay, everybody, come on,
let's look alive here.

1224
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,406
Okay.

1225
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,408
Is my notebook here yet?
Any minute, Nick.

1226
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,410
Good.
Call it, wanda.

1227
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:52,915
[Wanda] action on the smoke
machine, and roll sound. Speed.

1228
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:57,419
Roll camera.
Rollin'. Scene six, take three.

1229
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,922
Action.

1230
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,424
I am so hungry.

1231
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,426
[Hinges squeak]

1232
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:15,437
Oh... shit.
Uh... whoa! Jesus!

1233
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:18,941
[Actors coughing]
All right, cut, cut, cut!

1234
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:22,444
- [Explosion]
- [Wolf] bob, are you okay?

1235
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:23,946
[Fire alarm ringing]
Pull the plug!

1236
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,949
[Nick] You all right?
I can't find the switch.

1237
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,951
All right, okay, all right!
Clear the set!

1238
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:32,454
Ellen, tito, please step off the set!
[Alarm continues]

1239
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,456
[Man] what did you do?
[Tito] I'm off the set.

1240
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,458
[Ellen] So am i.
Well, who's that?

1241
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,961
Nick, wanda...
[wanda] who is that? Get off the set!

1242
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:42,464
[Alarm continues, crew clamoring]
I'm back with Nick's notebook.

1243
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,967
[Wanda] Please get us
some water in here!

1244
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:48,971
- Hi, Nicky.
- Mom?

1245
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:53,976
[Phone ringing]
Her name is cora reve. R-e-v-e.

1246
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:56,478
Blue housecoat,
blue slippers.

1247
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:00,482
How do I know that?
She's sitting 20 feet away from me.

1248
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,485
Yeah, well, sweetheart, that's gonna be a real
fuckin' problem...

1249
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,488
because I don't have
available people to go...

1250
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,491
she was waiting outside Nick's place when I went
to get his notebook.

1251
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,995
She said she was looking for him, so I figured
I should bring her here.

1252
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,497
[Phone continues ringing, wanda continues talking]
You look pretty in that dress.

1253
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:18,000
How did you get here?
I took a bus here.

1254
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,502
Went right to your apartment.
How did you get out of your room?

1255
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:24,006
Oh, I just went
right through the door.

1256
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:27,009
It was unlocked?
Oh, no, it was locked!

1257
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,511
I just went right through it.

1258
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:32,014
It's something
I've learned to do, Nick.

1259
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:36,018
I can walk through
just about anything, like air.

1260
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:39,521
Mom, you've got to stop this.
I'm serious, okay?

1261
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:44,026
I'm a little upset with you.
You could have gotten lost
or hurt.

1262
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:48,030
But I wanted to see you, Nick.
I miss you.

1263
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:53,535
Mom, I miss you too,
but this is not really a good time.

1264
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:01,043
Nick, they're sending a car.
It'll be here in a couple of hours

1265
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,546
they didn't even know she was gone.
Jesus, I don't believe this.

1266
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,049
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.

1267
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:12,054
If I knew there was gonna
be a wedding, I would have worn my fuckin' hat.

1268
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,056
Ho, ho, ho.

1269
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,060
Ha, ha, ha.

1270
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,564
- Ha, ha, ha.
- [Hissing]

1271
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,567
[Tito] Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.

1272
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,569
[Nick] Over here,
in this blue chair.

1273
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:31,073
All right, you just sit here.
Can you see? [Tito] ha, ha, ha.

1274
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,075
Is the little fellow
going to do gymnastics? Shh!

1275
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:35,577
No, mom!
Come on now.

1276
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:37,579
You've got to be quiet,
all right? Absolutely quiet.

1277
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,582
Okay.

1278
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:44,586
Okay, where the hell are we?
What's going on? How's the smoke machine?

1279
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,589
It's dead.
I've got calls to every effects house in the city.

1280
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:50,592
I can't locate one here, but in los angeles...
okay, forget it, forget it!

1281
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:53,095
We'll shoot without it.
But, Nick, it is a dream sequence.

1282
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:56,098
I know, wanda. It's okay.
We still have tito.

1283
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,600
All right?
We'll just gonna have to roll with it.

1284
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,103
Right, wolf?

1285
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,606
Yeah. All right.
Good, here we go.

1286
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,109
Ellen... all right, listen to me.
Nick, I... okay...

1287
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:10,612
you've got to reach for that apple.
Keep reaching for it.

1288
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,614
I don't feel like
you really want it.

1289
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:16,118
You're looking at it like, oh, it's an apple, yeah,
but you gotta want it.

1290
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,620
I don't know what you have to do,
how many times I have to tell you.

1291
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:23,625
But you've got to want that apple, all right?
Nicole, what...

1292
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,628
two seconds, wanda.
Then we shoot, goddamn it!

1293
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,633
[Door closes]
Nicole, what's the matter?

1294
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,136
You tell me.
You're the one with the bug up your ass.

1295
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:38,140
- Hey, wait just one second!
- You know, you've been picking
on me all day, Nick!

1296
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,643
I can't do anything right!
Well, I'm sorry if I've been
short with you, Nicole,

1297
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,645
but I think you can see
I'm under a little pressure.

1298
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,148
I'm shooting a dream sequence
without a smoke machine,

1299
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:49,151
I've got my mother thinking
she's at a circus wedding...

1300
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,153
and then you tell me
the whole movie seems fake!

1301
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:54,156
I never said that.
You did too! You said, "everything feels fake"!

1302
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:57,659
I meant me!
I feel fake!

1303
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,661
Everything I'm doing
feels fake!

1304
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,664
I can't act!
I should just do shower scenes...

1305
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:05,167
in richard gere movies
for the rest of my life!

1306
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:09,671
Nicole, that's ridiculous.
You're a fantastic actress.

1307
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:14,676
All you have to do is show me
you want that apple more than
anything else in the world.

1308
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:18,180
Don't give up.
Understand?

1309
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,183
Okay.

1310
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:25,187
You ready, Nick?
One second.
You ready?

1311
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,190
Yeah.
Come on.

1312
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,695
Look out.

1313
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:38,200
Sorry, Nick.
How's your dress?

1314
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,702
[Crew chattering]
[Door closes]

1315
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:44,706
Here we go.
Everybody concentrate and focus.

1316
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:47,709
Tito, we're still looking
for a little laugh, pal.

1317
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,711
[Tito] Heard you the first time.
Call it, wanda.

1318
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:54,716
Okay, picture's up.
There will be no smoke,
in this scene, all right?

1319
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:59,221
No smoke. No smoke
in the dream sequence.

1320
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,223
And lock it up.
[Indistinct walkie-talkie]

1321
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,725
Roll sound. Roll camera.
Speed.

1322
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,728
Rolling.
Scene six, take four.

1323
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,730
Action.

1324
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,233
I am so hungry.

1325
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,235
[Hinges squeak]

1326
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,750
Mom!

1327
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,753
[Crew] That was great.
What is the matter?

1328
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:34,756
Cut! [Wanda] Please stand by, people.
It's only a momentary delay.

1329
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,259
We're gonna be going again
right away.

1330
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:42,264
Listen to me, mom. Do not move from this chair.
Do you understand me?

1331
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:46,768
Jesus, you sound just like your father.
Mom, I'm serious!

1332
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:51,273
Okay.
Okay, I won't move.

1333
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,275
Thank you.

1334
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,277
[Softly] I won't move.
[Nick] Okay, good.

1335
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,279
Very good.

1336
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,782
Tito...
[chuckles]

1337
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:03,785
I think we're having
a little communication problem here.

1338
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:08,290
All I want you to do is laugh. Okay?
Why?

1339
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:12,794
I told you why.
[Sighs] Tell me again.

1340
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:16,298
[Nick] look, tito, you're overanalyzing this
whole thing. All right?

1341
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,800
[Tito]
I wanna be specific.

1342
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,305
Good.
Where'd you study?

1343
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,307
That's irrelevant,
where I studied.

1344
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,810
I just want you to know...
I'm just trying to get a feel...

1345
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,813
[tito, Nick continue,
indistinct]

1346
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,816
In order to laugh, you don't need a technique.
You just laugh.

1347
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,818
I want you to show me
how to laugh.

1348
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:40,822
I showed you.
I don't want you to copy my laugh.

1349
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,824
You just do whatever laugh.
Think of the funniest thing...

1350
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:46,828
what if I don't think anything's funny?
Think of something funny.

1351
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,831
Maybe you could give me something funny.
I don't know your life,

1352
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:53,835
so you're gonna have
to help me out here.
It's not a very fun life.

1353
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,839
[Tito, Nick continue, indistinct]
[Sniffling]

1354
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,841
Okay?
Why?

1355
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:03,345
Look, tito, it's not
that big of a deal.

1356
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:06,848
It's a dream.
Strange things happen in a dream.

1357
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:10,352
All I want you to do is laugh.
Why is that such a problem for you?

1358
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:13,855
Why does it have to be a dwarf?
What?

1359
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:17,859
Why does my character
have to be a dwarf?

1360
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,363
It doesn't have
to be a dwarf. Then why is he?

1361
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:25,367
Is that the only way you can make this a dream?
Put a dwarf in it?

1362
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:30,372
No, tito, i...
haveyouever had a dream
with a dwarf in it?

1363
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:34,876
Do you know anyone
who's had a dream
with a dwarf in it? No!

1364
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:38,380
I don't even have dreams
with dwarves in them.

1365
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:42,384
The only place I've
seen dwarves in dreams is
in stupid movies like this!

1366
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,386
Oh, make it weird.
Put a dwarf in it.

1367
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,388
Everyone will go,
"whoa, whoa, whoa!

1368
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,890
It must be a fuckin' dream!
There's a fuckin' dwarf in it!"

1369
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:53,895
Well, I'm sick of it!
You can take this dream sequence
and shove it up your ass!

1370
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:58,400
[Crew gasps]

[Door slams]

1372
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,930
Nick, I can get right
on the phone.

1373
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:32,434
We can try to get another
small person here...

1374
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,437
as soon as possible.

1375
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:38,940
No.
He's absolutely right.

1376
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:42,444
Do you wanna just shoot with
ellen, Nick? She could be
in the dream by herself.

1377
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,447
No.

1378
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,950
We're not gonna
shoot anything.

1379
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:50,952
I'm sorry.

1380
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:54,456
Thanks for all your help,
but... it's over.

1381
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:58,460
[Sighs]
I can't take it anymore.

1382
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,963
I tried to roll with it...

1383
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:05,467
but it's time
to face the music.

1384
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,469
I can't do this.

1385
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,971
The shoot is over.

1386
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,974
[Crew gasps]
I give up.

Shit.

01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,479

off the dolly, start putting it away.

I'm ready, Nick.

01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,506
[Crew]
What does that mean?

1396
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:48,510

Roll camera, wolf. Roll camera.

Cut! Whoa, whoa, wolf, talk to me, man.
Did you get that?

1404
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:35,557
Got it! Nick,
I'm tellin' ya, everything!

Yeah, see? Perfect!

Now that's what I meant about goin' hand-held.
You're a genius!

1407
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:43,565
[Nick] What about the focus?
[Maurice] nailed it!

1408
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,067
Yes! Okay! All right!

Going again, Nick?
How was the sound?

1410
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,574
I could use another,
but definitely acceptable.

Mom, you kook!
That was incredible!

1412

Did you know we were filming?
Of course I knew you were filming.

That was it! Come here.

that felt fake.

Can I really use this for the dream sequence?
That's the question.

1419
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:23,605
Does it work
for the dream sequence?

We're gonna go with it, wanda!

of silence.

01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,884
To all these people
and many more,

1488
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:08,389
[chuckling]
I-I would love to say thank you,

1489
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:11,392
but I can't...

1490
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:13,895
because what I really
feel like saying is...

1491
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,897
"go fu..."

1492
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:19,400
[ticking]

1493
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,903
[Ticking continues]

1494
01:27:24,856 --> 01:27:29,360
[Ticking] And... that's a cut
on room tone.

1495
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,863
Okay, strike the set!
Oh!
Sorry, mom.

1496
01:27:31,863 --> 01:27:36,367
Props, art department, we're moving on to scene 31.
Sit down over there.

1497
01:27:36,367 --> 01:27:39,370
Okay, let's go, people!
Come on! Where's my notebook?

1498
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:41,372
Nick? Nick!
Has anyone seen Nick?

1499
01:27:41,873 --> 01:27:44,375
[Crew chattering]

1500
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:46,878
[Wanda] can Nicole
get out of her wardrobe?

1501
01:27:46,878 --> 01:27:49,881
All right,
camera off the dolly!

1502
01:27:49,881 --> 01:27:54,385
Nick!
I want a twenty on Nick.
