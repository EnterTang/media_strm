Don't worry. You'll soon pick up on it and
come to understand everything around here.

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,430
What are all of you doing here? There's got to be
 some work you could instead be doing around the house!

43
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,160
Now please leave the room!
All of you! Out!

44
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,940
Here, have a bit of tea.

45
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,900
Well, there goes that glass of tea!
And for that matter, the glass too.

46
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,460

Don't look like you don't know what
I'm going to do about it.

49
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,710
As I've previously told you, if a glass gets broken, it comes out of your pay.

50
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,380
Chacha, how much pay have l
altogether now saved up with you?

51
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:04,504
Here, see for yourself

52
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,100
You've been wasting your life being on the streets.
You should be in school learning to read!

53
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,270
You've saved 5 rupees a day that you've earned.
That's a total of 150 rupees.

54
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,550
Less 10 rupees for the tea thats
been had by your pals around here.

55
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,980
Minus 2 rupees for the broken glass today.

56
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,270
So, its 150 rupees minus the twelve
as I've just explained .

57
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,780
How long then should it take
for me to save up 500 rupees?

58
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,280
Saving up now for your
 wedding in the future are you?

59
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,080
That sum will take a long
time to save, run along now!

60
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,680
Tea-boy, this tea is really
 watered down!

61
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,590
What do you expect me to do about it?
Water's plentiful around after all.

00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,040
Not until you're dead

158
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,340
I'm remembering that  foreigner!

159
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,570
You were as green when you first got here.

160
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,700
Do you remember that day?

161
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,550
When did you come to Bombay?

162
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,630
lt's ancient history, kid. l forgot.

163
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,000
How could you forget?

164
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,510
l was half your size
when l ran away from home.

165
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:31,070
When l was that high,
l had seen all of lndia three times.

166
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,520
By train, without paying the fare

167
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,940
Up, down...

168
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,690
left, right....

169
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,660
And then?

170
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,820
Forget it. Why spoil a good high?

171
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,920
So, what are your thoughts about?

172
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,920
Would you go back to 
the cold air of the village?

173
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,960
Yes. Just as soon as l
 have 500 rupees saved.

174
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,130
What's with this obsession with 
wanting to save up 500 rupees?

175
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,720
You know, my brother lied
to my mother about me.

176
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,600
He said l stole his money.

177
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,480
He beat me and did
 so whenever he felt like it.

178
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,530
When Father died, he became head of the family

179
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,030
l got upset.

180
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,780
He was a mechanic.
One day he came home with a client's bike.

181
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,200
l set it on fire.

182
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,220
Ma said l couldn't stay home anymore.

183
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:44,090
You bastard!

184
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,690
What happened next?

185
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,850
Ma took me to the circus...

186
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,220
and left me there. She said:

187
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,160
"Don't come back until you have earned
500 rupees to give your brother."

188
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,610
l said, "Fine.

189
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,360
"ln a month and 17 days,
l'll save 500 and come back home."

190
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,290
You stupid ass! You'll get burnt someday.

191
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,580
Forget them all!

192
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,120
Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, friends...

193
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,140
lovers, Sweet Sixteen.... Useless bloody lot.

194
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Me, too?

195
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,010
Aren't l your friend?

196
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,090
Chillum has no friends.

197
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,020
Mind your own business, or else....

198
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,300
Or else? The Chiller Room?

199
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,390
What's this Chiller Room?

200
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,480
Want to see it?

201
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,450
No problem.

202
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,540
l'll hand you over to a cop.

203
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,560
He'll show you in to the Chiller Room.

204
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,850
You'd never do that to me.

205
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,740
You've shown me paradise.

206
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,880
How many times must l tell you?

207
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,580
When l'm working, get lost!

208
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,130
-Scratching the door like an alley cat!
-No, l wasn't.

209
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,190
Now, what's wrong with this fuse?

210
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,570
Ma, Chaipau doesn't play with me.

211
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,950
Nobody does.

212
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,700
He gave Sweet Sixteen the baby chicken.

213
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,010
He didn't give it to me.
No one plays with me.

214
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:11,500
My heart, my sweet baby.

215
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,470
No one plays with you?

216
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,270
l'll play with you.

217
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,600
Want to hear a story?

218
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,830
Once upon a time, there lived a dog...

219
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,820
and a butterfly.
She'd fly here, she'd fly there.

220
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,710
The bad dog wanted to eat her up.

221
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,870
-And the butterfly?
-She'd fly here and there.

222
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,890
She flew away!

223
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,260
The lights are back on.

224
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,610
We had such fun in the dark.

225
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,500
We saw a butterfly and a dog.

226
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,820
Manju, scram.

227
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,630
Remember the last time the lights went out?

228
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,170
Do you remember 
my dear?

229
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:06,100
You shouldn't be sleeping out here

230
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,710
Hey, Bumpkin. One tea here.

231
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,080
l'll pay.

232
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,670
Prince, they're getting your virgin ready.

233
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,810
Where were you?

234
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,280
Can't come when you're sent for?

235
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,960
Think you're getting smart are you?

236
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,740
Your days are numbered.

237
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:49,990
Got your money.

238
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,950
Know Padmini in 103?

239
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,420
No. Why?

240
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,960
She died of an overdose.

241
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Really? l didn't know.

242
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,920
You should know.

243
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,300
l see you sell on this street, you're dead.

244
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,190
Scum, you know the rules, don't you?

245
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,760
Me? Sell Baba's drugs on Baba's street?

246
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,940
l don't do local business.

247
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:21,440
l only sell to foreigners
or to fools who say, as they die:

248
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,980
"Thank you, Baba."

249
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,000
Back off. This is my last warning.

250
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,210
Okay, Boss.

251
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,330
Bastard!

252
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,970
And you? Bitch!

253
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,590
What's going on here?

254
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,130
They set fire to the house.

255
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,650
Bouncer caught them.
This bastard brought her matches.

256
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:01,520
We paid a fortune for your virginity...

257
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,110
and you burn the house down?

258
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,270
You set the fire?

259
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,230
-She said what?
-She says she wants to die.

260
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,290
So die, you bitch!

261
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:15,030
Do you want the Police involved?

262
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,570
l'll cut you up into little pieces.

263
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:22,880
-Baba's here now.
-She's got some nerve.

264
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,170
lf l catch you here again...

265
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,800
l'll wring your neck. Get out!

266
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,010
Want something to drink?
Some tea? Some water?

267
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,300
Don't worry.

268
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,440
Baba's here. lt'll be all right.

269
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,950
Nobody will dare say a word.

270
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,940
Your tactics won't work
 here at number109.

271
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,670
Looking for more trouble? Calmly, now.

272
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,950
Want a job? Tame her for me.

273
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,580
Baba doesn't do that work anymore.

274
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,800
Think it over.

275
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,840
She's worth 10,000.

276
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,300
Once she's deflowered, 
it'll be 1000 for you. Well?

277
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,290
"Respected Mother, greetings.

278
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,170
"l'm well. Hope you are, too.

279
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,590
"l didn't run away.

280
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,010
"l went back to the circus,
but they had all left.

281
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,680
"l work in Chacha's tea shop.
l think of home."

282
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,770
Go on.

283
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,180
"l want to come home".

284
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,200
"As soon as l have the 500, l'll be back".

285
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,690
"They call me Chaipau here, not Krishna".

286
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,570
"Don't worry about me".

287
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,870
"When l go to sleep, l miss you".

288
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:29,260
That line will cost extra. 50 paisa more.

289
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,910
Then drop it.

290
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,800
"Your obedient son...." What's your name?

291
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,000
Krishna.

292
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,340
Mother's address?

293
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,390
Bijapur village. Near the riverbank.

294
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,760
Near Bholabhai's shop.

295
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,890
Ask for Krishna's mother, Sundari.

296
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,900
-That's an address?
-Yes.

297
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,270
Your "yes" won't get it there.

298
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,120
There are many Bijapurs all over lndia.

299
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,530
Which one do you mean?

300
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,910
lt's near Bangalore.

301
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,910
lt'll have to do. "Bijapur, near Bangalore."

302
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,040
Don't know where these
 suckers all come from

303
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,760
Waste of a stamp!

304
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,810
The crow flies, the bird flies,
the parrot flies, the house flies.

305
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,980
You lost that round.

306
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,980
Manju, do something for me.

307
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,790
Give this to Sweet Sixteen.

308
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,300
-You gave it to her?
-Yes.

309
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,270
This journalist wants to talk to you.

310
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,150
Tell her...

311
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,610
Baba's current woman
used to work the streets here.

312
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,910
l rescued her from the gutter.

313
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,700
This is my child.

314
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,530
Say hello.

315
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:59,500
He says the woman he lives with
was a prostitute.

316
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,890
And he rescued her and brought her here.

317
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,960
And that's his daughter.

318
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,920
My actions speak louder than words.

319
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,470
And tell her...

320
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,760
she's beautiful stuff.

321
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,030
You think I'll tell her that?

322
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,310
What did he say?

323
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,020
He said, "Would you like to have some tea?"

324
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,780
Order some tea.

325
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:31,400
Three teas, up here!

326
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,200
-The camera for sale?
-No.

327
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,550
Want a two-in-one?

328
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,170
Another white sucker!

329
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,200
Chillum, prince of my kingdom!

330
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,920
What's the hurry? We'll put on a little show.

331
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,750
Stand over here.

332
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,310
Okay, jump!

333
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,390
Good! Bravo!

334
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,480
Well done.

335
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,370
Please.

336
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,370
Hang on. Where are you going?

337
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,660
Look, wait! Listen....

338
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,470
Still here? This your father's house?

339
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,980
The bird's flown.

340
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:29,690
Shut your mouth!

341
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,450
Go on, laugh! You'll be crying soon.

342
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,240
What did l do?

343
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,450
You no longer work for Baba.

344
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,870
Firing me just for laughing?

345
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,240
l'm tired of your mug.

346
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,090
The same mug has sold
your drugs for years.

347
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,130
-Our accounts are clear.
- No they're not!

348
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,050
What about the 150 the tourist paid?

349
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,310
That was a slip.

350
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:58,090
People do make mistakes. l'll give you back the 150.

351
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,440
The dealings between
 you and I are at an end!

352
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,640
Take off. You're now retired.

353
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:10,110
What will Baba do? Start a new company?

354
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,900
Hook another bumpkin on drugs?

355
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,200
Listen, hero. Bullshit the others, not me.

356
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:20,660
-You going?
-l'm going, with pleasure.

357
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,790
Now you know what Baba is.

358
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,970
Baba, play with me.

359
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,070
Came with the child?

360
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,350
l couldn't leave her at home.

361
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:47,790
Sit here. Don't touch anything.

362
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,140
Chaipau...

363
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,980
this is Manju.

364
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,440
See how they dance.

365
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,160
How nicely they dance.

366
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:49,780
Here, look.

367
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,370
lsn't it nice?

368
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,840
l'm in the big room.
Will you come and see me?

369
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:04,710
Will you come?

370
00:53:04,834 --> 00:53:05,779
Come soon!

371
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:09,160
When will you come?

372
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,390
Chillum!

373
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,270
l'll finish him off!

374
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:24,190
The cops will come!

375
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,990
l'll kill that pimp!

376
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,860
Are you mad?

377
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,700
Who told Baba about the tourist?

378
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,460
lt wasn't me.

379
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,500
Who squealed?

380
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,430
Not me. l told only Chungal.

381
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,730
lf you'd told me not to,
I wouldn't have said anything

382
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,690
Got any money?
-No, pal. l swear it!

383
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,820
Come, get some sleep rest

384
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,990
l can't sleep!

385
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:07,450
l can't sleep without a fix.

386
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,650
Everyone it seems  looks
 very happy tonight.

387
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:40,980
Baba, look.

388
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,030
Go sleep outside.

389
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,820
l want to sleep here.

390
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,670
-No. Outside.
-Can't l sleep here?

391
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:58,330
l told you, go outside,
or you'll get a slap.

392
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,090
What would have been so wrong about 
letting Manju sleep here tonight?

393
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,480
You took her with you?

394
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,350
l couldn't leave her with
you in your state of mind.

395
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,350
Aren't you ashamed
to say such a thing to me?

396
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,190
Go on...

397
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,610
... answer me.

398
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,670
Her training started already?

399
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:40,500
You pimp. Get out of my life!
l'll finish you off!

400
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,470
How dare you touch me!

401
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:46,430
What did l say? Just don't take her with you.

402
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,050
ls this place any better for her?

403
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,840
What a louse you are!
 You promised me the world.

404
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:01,430
"When she's born,
we'll start a new life." New life!

405
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,390
Bloody liar!

406
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:11,480
Everyone thinks l'm a two-bit pimp.

407
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,110
What can l say now?

408
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,180
Spit out your anger, my angel.

409
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,060
What's happened has happened.
Bury your anger.

410
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,150
Tell me....

411
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,660
Where did you go, my jewel?

412
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,030
To Ravi's.

413
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,410
Doesn't matter.

414
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,810
A new nightie?

415
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,810
Think you're a whore's
who's  too fancy for me?

416
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,870
Just like any "John"

417
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:40,820
l told you to get lost!

418
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:58,670
Chillum's very sick.
We need money for medicine.

419
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,140
Take what you need.

420
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,830
l took out 20.

421
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,030
Fine.

422
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:35,420
Chillum said the souls
of Bombay's dead children...

423
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:38,630
wander under the bridge at night.

424
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,550
You believe everything Chillum says?

425
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:06,960
This drug racket isn't my scene.
So don't tell Chillum.

426
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,790
l won't.

427
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:13,610
Please come this way.

428
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,450
Now, be pleasant.
Don't think of other things.

429
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,120
Ready...

430
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,460
one, two, three.

431
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,960
Thank you.

432
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,900
Who said you could take her out?

433
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,490
Gungu Bai, you want her tamed, right?

434
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:10,160
You know Baba's style.
lf you don't trust me....

435
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:15,250
Never mind trust! All I can say
 is she'd better still be a virgin!

436
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,130
l don't cheat clients. A virgin is what 
they want, and a virgin is what I give them

437
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,820
Do a good job with those chickens.

438
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,030
You'll be paid 10 rupees each.
Here's the knife.

439
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,540
l can do it.

440
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,710
lt's very easy.

441
01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:59,710
Chaipau...

442
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,800
help me!

443
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,890
Ask the boss for an advance.

444
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:09,340
Ask him for a little. Please.

445
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:11,770
No.

446
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,340
You got paid?

447
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:46,100
Yes. Where were you?

448
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,090
Looking for money.

449
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,380
Had a smoke?

450
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:53,550
No, pal. No smoke.
l was waiting for you. Got any money?

451
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,860
lt's money to go home.

452
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,430
Listen fella, you are not coming?

453
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,450
We've been slaving all day.

454
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:02,980
l missed my tea rounds.

455
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,620
Chacha will beat me. And you!

456
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:09,490
Lecturing me for 2 lousy rupees.

457
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,820
-Let me have it, please
-No.

458
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:18,460
l'll go home with you.
Let me have it now.

459
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,420
-Forgive me!
-Don't touch me.

460
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,100
-One more chance.
-You stink!

461
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,600
Bloody pimp!

462
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,640
Lives off women!

463
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,560
Chacha, a tea, please.

464
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:55,510
He's been smoking too much.

465
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:20,120
Stop it! What's come over you?

466
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:27,220
l need it badly. l need some dope.

467
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,460
Chaipau, get me some!

468
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:36,560
lt feels tight inside.

469
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:49,480
Ask your mother for money.

470
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:55,080
She's not home.

471
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:21,590
l want to die. l want to die.

472
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:30,150
l don't want to die. Chaipau, save me.

473
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,700
Don't worry, l'll do something.

474
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,860
l'll save money. We'll go back to the village.

475
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:42,450
lt's lovely there.
We'll leave this Bombay, forever.

476
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:29,200
Stand straight!
Didn't l tell you to make it tighter?

477
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,590
But how will the poor girl breathe?

478
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:36,170
You won't stop breathing, will you?
Do as you're told.

479
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,880
The first client is vital.

480
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:39,800
Take it off.

481
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:53,270
You did your job. 
It's now over. Well done!

482
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:57,060
l'll send you your money.
Don't bother coming over here again.

483
01:07:58,110 --> 01:07:59,440
Keep the door open.

484
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,370
What a beauty you are.

485
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,490
So lovely.

486
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,800
So innocent.

487
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:18,960
Like a rose in the gutter.

488
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,930
l'll take you away from here.

489
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,100
As soon as l get money...

490
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,100
l'll buy off your "madam".

491
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,230
Do you understand?

492
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,280
l'll rescue you.

493
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:42,280
Be patient.

494
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:46,740
Tell me...

495
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,950
will you wait for me?

496
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,460
Will you?

497
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:12,510
And where were you?
Am l running a charity?

498
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:14,850
Where were you?

499
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:18,350
Working. l told a pal to do my rounds.

500
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:21,830
You told a pal of yours?
Like you've ever been on time!

501
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:25,330
Broke glasses, made trouble in 109...

502
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:28,360
lost me business. l've warned you before...

503
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,040
if you dont work out
 right, you're out!

504
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,660
Seen many like you 
come though here

505
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:39,210
Here's 300 minus 50...

506
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:41,420
for all the trouble you've caused.

507
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:46,760
Don't come back tomorrow. 
You no longer work here.

508
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,190
Can't ever collect trash these days.
They're guarding that, too.

509
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:04,330
l told you! Stop collecting trash.
Coolie work is best.

510
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,070
Shut up! You're like a broken record.

511
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:12,040
Chaipau! Why such a long face?

512
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:23,590
Chacha sacked me.

513
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:26,390
Hey, fellows, want to do a job?

514
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,840
We know your kind of job.

515
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:32,840
Cash. Hard cash!

516
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,650
No guts, no glory.

517
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,240
Count me in.

518
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,370
Need a boy to fetch milk?

519
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,780
Yes, that's right.

520
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,880
Little girl, what's your name?

521
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,960
-You go to school?
-Yes.

522
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:55,090
And who are you?

523
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:57,800
Brothers.

524
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:02,240
Sit down. l'll bring you kids
something to eat.

525
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:04,810
Like a sweet treat?

526
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,480
Nothing, sir!

527
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:15,110
How did you get in? Who are you? Thieves!

528
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:20,870
Chungal, leave him to me.

529
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,000
l've got to pee.

530
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,380
Run, Bumpkin!

531
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:28,390

533
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,560
l can even speak English.
Hello! Shut up! As you like!

534
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:42,180
Salaam to the King of Bombay,
salute, my buddy

535
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,740

eat, drink and be merry

536
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,540

537
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:10,670

538
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:15,670
l flee! l fly!

539
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:23,520
So what if the train's in! l'm not budging.

540
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,130
Be it whiskey or be it palm wine

541
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:43,130
Drinking is a must

542
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:48,170
Keep on drinking till you go bust

543
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:50,890
Fantastic! Bravo!

544
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:52,750
What poetry! Let's hear another.

545
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:56,100
My perfume lingers in your beard

546
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:59,720
My flower lingers in your crotch

547
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,140
How do you feel?

548
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:07,270
lf one had to live,
then life should be like this.

549
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,600
Not missing your mother?

550
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,780
l am! l'm going home tomorrow.

551
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:43,270
Baba, wake up!

552
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:49,680
What is it?

553
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,450
Chillum's very sick.

554
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:54,230
You woke me for that?

555
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,360
He's shaking like a leaf. He's ice-cold.

556
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:00,820
All that junkie needs is a fix.

557
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,220
What happened?

558
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:25,390
He overdosed.

559
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:35,230
The name of God is truth.

560
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,450
What are you up to?

561
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:53,120
You lousy thief!

562
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:55,540
Where's my money?

563
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:58,040
Give me back my money.

564
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:02,210
My money to go home.

565
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:04,380
Chillum took your money. l saw him.

566
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,150
Jerk! Accuse me of
 being a thief?

567
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,070
l want to go home.

568
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,530
Hey, there, wash the
 glasses properly.

569
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:57,530
Thats just what l'm doing?
 Don't pester me.

570
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,140
Mommy, he hit me.

571
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,000
Pass the food.

572
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:27,870
No tips for us?

573
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:29,590
Be grateful for what you get.

574
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:34,140
We're not beggars, sir.
Just 20 rupees for so much work?

575
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:36,470
Shut up and eat. Here, Manju.

576
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,050
Eat all you can. Now's your chance.

577
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:44,100
This bill looks torn.

578
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:46,850
Guess it'll do.

579
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:08,790
My stomach's bursting!

580
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,080
You ate enough for 20 meals.

581
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,010
Didn't you do the same?

582
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:16,640
No. ls that a stomach
or 
a large edifice you have?

583
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:20,090
Hey, Salim. You shouldn't have hit that kid.

584
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:21,980
We would've had it.

585
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:26,270
With rich kids, you can never win.

586
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,230
The rich don't scare me.

587
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:45,910
Stop!

588
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,420
What are you up to?

589
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,590
We're going home, sir.

590
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,170
We've just finished duty at a wedding.

591
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:58,970
What's this?

592
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:02,970
King of samosa thieves!

593
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,350
l didn't steal them, sir.

594
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,980
What's in there?

595
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:18,280
My money to go home.

596
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:21,400
lt's true, sir.

597
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:22,870
Sure it's true! Come on.

598
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,330
l'll take you home.

599
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:34,330
lt'll be all right.

600
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:37,380
One day...

601
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:42,050
in our lndia, things will be all right.

602
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:34,850
Come down!

603
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:56,430
Brothers!

604
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,130
Sing with one voice.

605
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,880
Yes, sir!

606
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:08,050
You are my father, you are my mother

607
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:17,410
You are my friend, you are everything to me

608
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:26,610
We're the flowers that never bloom

609
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:35,090
We're the dust that lies beneath your feet

610
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,710
Always look upon us
with mercy in your eyes

611
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,400
You are my friend, you are everything to me

612
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,740
Long live lndia!

613
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:08,450
What's your name?

614
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:09,860
Krishna.

615
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,340
Here for stealing butter like Lord Krishna!

616
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:15,040
So, what are you in for?

617
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:18,250
-What's it to you?
-Don't act smart. Answer.

618
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,330
-l did nothing.
-Liar.

619
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,890
Don't call me a liar.

620
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:04,840
They're off to another court hearing.

621
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:06,800
Show me your card.

622
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,560
What's on it?

623
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:17,610
Your court date is in six months.

624
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:21,190
So take it easy, relax. Be cool.

625
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,230
My name is Murtaza.

626
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:28,440
l saw you destroy Lalua Chor.

627
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:32,500
They're always picking on me.
l'm not even new.

628
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:34,160
Been here five years.

629
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:35,620
Five years!

630
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:38,410
Some boys have been here longer.

631
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:42,550
l didn't do anything. They can't keep me.

632
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:45,500
They can. See that buddy over there?

633
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,880
He was caught pissing on the street.

634
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,430
They got him.
He's been inside for three years.

635
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:58,180
l didn't do anything.
Even if l did, l've forgotten.

636
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:02,100
Five years, and they all forget us.

637
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:08,190
See that boy?

638
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,780
They pick on him all day.

639
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,570
He spends his time washing his shirt!

640
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:16,910
His screw is loose.

641
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:19,870
You know what I mean by a loose "screw"?

642
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,370
Krishna, teach me your kick.

643
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:28,470
Show me how you do it.

644
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:36,430
Like this?

645
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,890
Krishna, is this right?

646
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:27,200
Manju Golub!

647
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:45,080
Manju.

648
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:50,930
How are you?

649
01:29:58,220 --> 01:29:59,390
Are you all right?

650
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:06,560
Why don't you  respond?

651
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:17,070
How can l tell you
how lost l feel without you?

652
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:28,250
Your friends ask,
"Where's Manju?"

653
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:35,470
What a nice dress that is!

654
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:45,820
Want to play?

655
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:55,730
Don't worry, my dear

656
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:57,910
We'll take you home soon.

657
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,780
Don't worry.

658
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:12,290
Don't be scared.
We'll come back and take you home.

659
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:51,540
Long live Lord Ganesh

660
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:55,170
ln your presence,
all obstacles can be overcome

661
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,350
Krishna, have l got it right?

662
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:15,850
Get lost!

663
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:33,970
Come here, you retard!

664
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:35,680
Hiding like a mouse.

665
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:36,920
Leave him alone.

666
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:39,250
Think you're in charge?

667
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:43,550
Enough of your tough act.

668
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:45,880
Now watch me!

669
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,400
When can l take her home?

670
01:33:01,070 --> 01:33:02,570
Have a seat.

671
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:12,130
Children don't always know
what's best for them.

672
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:15,250
We have children whose parents beat them.

673
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,630
Yet they cling to their parents.

674
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,640
l've never hit her. 
What on earth are you on about?

675
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,420
Just an example.

676
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:26,260
Look at Manju. Why doesn't she speak?

677
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:30,510
She wants to go home.
She doesn't like it here.

678
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:33,890
She was fine. She used to talk a lot.

679
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,360
The past is irrelevant.

680
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:39,730
We're dealing with the present here.

681
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:42,980
You see, women like you....

682
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:45,400
Well, let's forget about that.

683
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,500
Your file's here. Let me look.

684
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:59,250
"Due to the fact
that the mother is a prostitute...

685
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,170
"the state has decided...

686
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:05,130
"for the child's welfare, she must be kept...

687
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:08,940
"in state custody until she comes of age."

688
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:20,400
Of course, you have the right to appeal.

689
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:23,110
But why would you?

690
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:28,110
Why not let her be adopted
by a good family?

691
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:31,740
She will have a life.

692
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,740
lt'll be easier on you, too. Won't it?

693
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,630
She's my daughter.

694
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:44,760
She's all l have in the world.

695
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:49,840
How can the State be her mother?

696
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,550
Sixer!

697
01:36:03,170 --> 01:36:04,960
Bad luck!

698
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,920
He can't play cricket.
He's better doing toothpaste ads on TV!

699
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:13,350
Go brush your teeth instead!

700
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:17,180
Quiet! Let me listen.

701
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:26,230
Silence! Silence!

702
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:44,010
Every night, l dream that l escape
from the Chiller Room.

703
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:49,590
lf anyone tries to stop me, l kick them.

704
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:58,400
Anyone gets in my way,
 l just kick them.

705
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,560
Right! Dream on!

706
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,990
Krishna, want to try?

707
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:10,490
Get lost, fool!

708
01:37:11,110 --> 01:37:13,490
l swear it. l'm not joking.

709
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:21,730
That way.

710
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:23,510
lt's seems so far.

711
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:44,330
Let's try our luck.

712
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,180
No luck!

713
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,300
Look over there.

714
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:40,840
Hurry! Come on.

715
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:23,380
-Just wat are you up to?
-lt's mine.

716
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,310
Who are you?

717
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:27,140
Chillum.

718
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,240
Where are the others?

719
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:38,830
On trash rounds.

720
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:40,440
You work for Baba?

721
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:42,620
-Yes.
-Sell his drugs?

722
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:47,080
-Do you smoke the stuff too?
- Mind your own business.

723
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,490
l'm going home.

724
01:41:57,690 --> 01:41:59,900
Will you come with me?

725
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:30,510
This way, please.

726
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:39,520
Just look at her! Stand up, dear.

727
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:48,110
Turn around, dear.

728
01:42:51,410 --> 01:42:53,280
lsn't she a pure bud?

729
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:57,920
l've kept her safely, especially for you.

730
01:42:58,380 --> 01:42:59,720
Beautiful!

731
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:07,010
Come, my dear.

732
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,830
Where are you going?

733
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:03,620
Are you leaving home?

734
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:08,430
-Without Manju there is no home.
-But l'm here.

735
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:13,300
You said this wasn't a good place for Manju.

736
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,350
l'll bring her back.

737
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:22,930
Promise. Baba's promise.

738
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,900
l know what trust to put into your promises.

739
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:28,690
Go to that gal "Sweet Sixteen".

740
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:32,480
That was work. Nothing else.
Must l refuse work?

741
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:33,820
Drop it.

742
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:37,500
lf you say drop it, l'll drop it.

743
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,050
Now l'm yours, full-time.

744
01:45:44,790 --> 01:45:48,040
Tired of work? lt happens, l understand.

745
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,880
Let's go out. Where shall we go?

746
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:52,920
Where will you live?

747
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:55,880
You won't survive out there in 
this merciless city of Bombay.

748
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,020
Out of my way!

749
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:06,140
What haven't l done for you? 
You're leaving with a valid reason.

750
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:14,490
Turning holy, whore?

751
01:46:15,070 --> 01:46:17,150
Think you can now perhaps 
just  wash away your sins?

752
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:20,580
Think you could now even
 become "Mother lndia"?

753
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:25,630
Look, l don't want trouble.
Get out of my way.

754
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:28,880
Or else what? Will you kill me?

755
01:46:33,550 --> 01:46:35,710
Finish me off, my angel.

756
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:38,350
Kill me! Go on!

757
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:41,510
Finish me off, kill me!

758
01:54:32,534 --> 01:54:40,334
