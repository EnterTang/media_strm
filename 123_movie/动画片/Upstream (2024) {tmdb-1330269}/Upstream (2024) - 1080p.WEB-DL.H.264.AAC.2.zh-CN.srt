1
00:01:17.622 --> 00:01:19.326
Kaoru!

2
00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:27.057
Come here!

3
00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:29.040
There is something to see.

4
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:42.810
Hanai,

5
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:47.512
didn't I warn you
not to fart?

6
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:11,450
Did you know that a carburetor * computer ?

7
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:17.386
- This one * usually *?
- Don't know.

8
00:02:22.036 --> 00:02:25.325
- Silver.
- Silver?

9
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:32.700
Yes, it turns out that you can fall in love with a bike.

10
00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:36.238
Cold! What are you doing!

11
00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:42.075
My love...

12
00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.670
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:56.405
Stupid, open your eyes!

14
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.924
School is not just for you!

15
00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:07.233
- *
- I accidentally.

16
00:03:07.577 --> 00:03:09.655
I'm sorry it happened.

17
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:14,447
Hey, am I a statue for you?

18
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:18,210
Do you have any money for repairs?
I am not kidding.

19
00:03:18.592 --> 00:03:21.639
Look at both! The motorcycle is brand new.

20
00:03:21.991 --> 00:03:25.381
And if it breaks, who will pay?

21
00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:29.061
Never mind... you're not evil, are you?

22
00:03:29.086 --> 00:03:31.272
Let's forget about it.

23
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:35,116
Everyone can make a mistake.
Let's start again?

24
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:37,748
Nothing bad happened.

25
00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:41.007
What is your name?

26
00:03:57.538 --> 00:04:01.319
Sensei, here is today's journal.

27
00:04:01.397 --> 00:04:05.147
You are on time.
We have a new one, Hanai.

28
00:04:11.482 --> 00:04:14.584
Are you out of your mind?

29
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:20,404
Sorry to say goodbye, but...

30
00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:25.370
We won't walk together anymore.

31
00:04:25.395 --> 00:04:27.527
I got a job.

32
00:04:27.573 --> 00:04:29.495
What are you talking about?

33
00:04:29.597 --> 00:04:31.397
Don't you understand?

34
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:33.912
I finally realized.

35
00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:37.182
What?

36
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:50,753
I'm still inexperienced in this, so I can not say.

37
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.456
Yes, we are not forcing you.

38
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:56,542
- Okay, I'll tell you.
- Well, speak!.

39
00:05:00.147 --> 00:05:02.287
Okay, let's go.

40
00:05:02.987 --> 00:05:05.256
- I fell in love.
- Bye.

41
00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:58.937
What are you smiling at
when you don't even stay afloat?

42
00:06:23.664 --> 00:06:26.939
I never found out your name.

43
00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:33.196
- I'm Hanai Kaoru. And you?
- I'm Ririko.

44
00:06:34,305 --> 00:06:35,650
My name?

45
00:06:36.422 --> 00:06:39.853
I'm not getting acquainted with anyone.
Bye.

46
00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:45.996
Wait a minute.

47
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:49,144
Wait.
Sonoko-kun.

48
00:06:52.316 --> 00:06:54.597
What was the point in asking then?

49
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,155
During the first meeting
it is mandatory to ask the name of the other person.

50
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,464
Let's go.

51
00:07:04.644 --> 00:07:06.707
See you.

52
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.669
(Kaoru) came.
He is waiting in the backyard.

53
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:34,489
- Let me borrow your bike.
- No.

54
00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:37.835
Why so?

55
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.328
Pu (name), who am I talking to?

56
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:51,312
- You have no patience.
- Damn, I don't have time.

57
00:07:52.794 --> 00:07:55.232
Busy...

58
00:07:56.137 --> 00:07:58.202
What are you busy with?

59
00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:00.179
With something.

60
00:08:05.521 --> 00:08:06.960
For example?

61
00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:09.810
Explain.

62
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:13,857
Can't say.
I already told you, with something.

63
00:08:15.755 --> 00:08:16.979
OK.

64
00:08:18.278 --> 00:08:19.338
Let it be.

65
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.533
I will pay.

66
00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:25.940
But I definitely won't leave empty-handed. *

67
00:08:27.721 --> 00:08:29.721
Do not humiliate yourself.

68
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.190
Stupid.

69
00:08:32.955 --> 00:08:35.333
I still have several of them.

70
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:45,232
Thank you.

71
00:08:49.832 --> 00:08:52.434
Would you like to thank me? *

72
00:08:53.193 --> 00:08:55.911
Did you say something?

73
00:08:57.099 --> 00:08:58.607
Call me on a date.

74
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:15,428
Masaki-san, good morning.

75
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,178
You are early today.
Sonoko is still sleeping.

76
00:10:29.583 --> 00:10:32.153
Masaki-san, even if you don't wear makeup,
you still look great.

77
00:10:34.115 --> 00:10:37.513
Don't suck up.
And don't call my mom by her first name.

78
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:39,333
It's not a problem.

79
00:10:39.443 --> 00:10:42.873
- Stop talking, sit down.
- I'll sit down, I'll sit down.

80
00:10:43.052 --> 00:10:46.685
- Like I have a choice.
- You have to listen to your mother.

81
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,130
- You're too cheeky...
- I see you're getting along.

82
00:10:50.155 --> 00:10:51.826
Where have you seen that?

83
00:10:51.859 --> 00:10:54.469
Sonoko, where did you get such words?

84
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,156
- Don't mess with your mom.
- Exactly.

85
00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:05.798
- Looks like everyone is athlete.
- You don't get it.

86
00:12:05.823 --> 00:12:09.267
- I'm still tonkachi. - Kanazuchi?
[both mean "hammer" like "axe in water"]

87
00:12:09.292 --> 00:12:12.367
[Tzh. tonkachi means "to be a noob"]
I will participate in the Olympics.

88
00:12:12.392 --> 00:12:14.753
- Cool.
"For your sake, Sonoko-kun.

89
00:12:14.778 --> 00:12:18.308
- Stop doing that...
- See you this Sunday?

90
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:22.417
- Nagai, get ready.
- OK. [Don't confuse Nagai with Hanai]

91
00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:25.441
- Who is he?
- Nagai-kun.

92
00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:27.845
Don't know him?

93
00:12:29.035 --> 00:12:31.910
Look and you will understand.

94
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.186
Understood? This is how a swimmer should be.

95
00:13:05.328 --> 00:13:08.039
And before that, don't even talk about the Olympics.

96
00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:51.319
I'm afraid of water.

97
00:13:55.281 --> 00:13:57.390
Why did you sign up then?

98
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,304
Just wondering.

99
00:14:07.812 --> 00:14:09.468
I want to swim.

100
00:14:12.132 --> 00:14:13.710
Cool.

101
00:14:36.785 --> 00:14:39.378
Lots of chlorine...

102
00:14:52.144 --> 00:14:54.152
One by one, let's dive in!

103
00:15:26.606 --> 00:15:29.965
Hurry, don't delay the others.

104
00:15:41.618 --> 00:15:43.595
What freak did this?

105
00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.325
Did you hear my command?

106
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:50.454
Damn old lady.
Little ones, shut up!

107
00:15:50.607 --> 00:15:54.013
- What did you say about my children?
- What?

108
00:15:54.107 --> 00:15:56.966
- What what?
- What's what?

109
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.216
He told you to shut up!

110
00:16:08.193 --> 00:16:10.099
Are you serious?

111
00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:20.669
Your name is Kaoru, right?

112
00:16:21.083 --> 00:16:24.146
Are you going to the Olympics by any chance?

113
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.724
- How did you guess?
- Hmmm...

114
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.076
But not only for this.

115
00:16:30.145 --> 00:16:34.567
Don't rant here.
I would explain myself.

116
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:37,177
I can do it myself.

117
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,630
I will definitely win.

118
00:16:41.013 --> 00:16:42.615
What?

119
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:58.787
- Gran, what nonsense!
- Takashi, call me grandmother! *

120
00:17:02.048 --> 00:17:05.806
Every time you bring *,
without asking anyone.

121
00:17:06.979 --> 00:17:09.643
Gran, you're to blame too.

122
00:17:33.838 --> 00:17:37.760
- There is no pool today; let's go together?
What about Kaoru-kun?

123
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:41,307
That's the point, until he noticed.

124
00:17:50.479 --> 00:17:53.042
Where is everyone?

125
00:17:59.979 --> 00:18:01.482
Pu.

126
00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.366
So are you going on a date?

127
00:18:13.523 --> 00:18:15.787
Don't push me like that.

128
00:18:18.054 --> 00:18:20.459
Where are you going?

129
00:18:25.585 --> 00:18:27.999
- Get the bike back.
- Why so suddenly?

130
00:18:28.062 --> 00:18:32.483
- You don't want to ride it with me.
- Is there anyone besides me?

131
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:35,796
You do not know me!

132
00:18:36.085 --> 00:18:41.327
When I ride it, everyone around shouts "honey"!

133
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,702
Do not laugh!
You are alone here!

134
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.053
You don't have any friends?

135
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,163
Who would want to be friends with someone like you?
- Got it, got it, go ahead. *

136
00:18:59.467 --> 00:19:02.334
You don't call me at all.

137
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:07,272
You was so busy that you couldn't even tell?

138
00:19:09.968 --> 00:19:12.202
Probably didn't have time to eat.

139
00:19:14.685 --> 00:19:17.599
- You didn't sleep, did you?
- * didn't do it either.

140
00:19:17.812 --> 00:19:19.398
Stupid, don't be rude.

141
00:19:23.796 --> 00:19:25.717
Pu, will you wait for me? *

142
00:19:25.913 --> 00:19:28.491
- Do not catch my eye!
- As you wish!

143
00:19:34.123 --> 00:19:36.920
- Do you know what it is?
- No.

144
00:19:37.006 --> 00:19:40.155
- Sweet potato.
- Strange.

145
00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.538
Potato.

146
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,226
Kaoru-kun goes to extra workout?

147
00:19:49.304 --> 00:19:52.726
It just sounds awesome.
He tries in vain.

148
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:56,304
So that's how it is...
I do not understand him.

149
00:19:57.296 --> 00:20:00.530
Does he feel something for you?
- Come on!

150
00:20:00.671 --> 00:20:03.663
I don't mind your jokes

151
00:20:03.733 --> 00:20:06.155
but there is nothing between me and him.

152
00:20:50.511 --> 00:20:53.832
It's great when someone loves you.

153
00:20:53.857 --> 00:20:56.472
Depends on who loves.

154
00:20:56.551 --> 00:21:01.332
- You're so naughty.
- Ririko, did someone think of me?

155
00:21:02.777 --> 00:21:04.722
Who knows?

156
00:21:08.402 --> 00:21:12.051
Good weather.
How about "warabimochi" [sweet jelly]?

157
00:21:12.214 --> 00:21:14.714
- My treat?
- Yeah.

158
00:22:11.135 --> 00:22:12.667
Date?

159
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:14,602
Such a coincidence.

160
00:22:14.642 --> 00:22:18.017
- Where are you going?
- So?

161
00:22:18.056 --> 00:22:20.633
- Where where...
- We're going to the cinema.

162
00:22:23.993 --> 00:22:26.563
- Who is this?
- My girlfriend.

163
00:22:26.751 --> 00:22:29.665
- You're a macho man.
- C'mon.

164
00:22:29.829 --> 00:22:32.306
How did you meet?

165
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.970
- Spontaneously.
- I see.

166
00:22:36.884 --> 00:22:38.969
Spontaneous, you heard?

167
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,350
But is it possible?

168
00:22:45.767 --> 00:22:47.438
Is it possible?

169
00:22:48.079 --> 00:22:49.876
This is how love is born. *

170
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:59,251
- We're going to a cafe.
- Cool.

171
00:23:06.922 --> 00:23:08.656
How are you behaving?

172
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:12,202
Wow, I've never been so embarrassed.
[second meaning "unlucky"]

173
00:23:12.227 --> 00:23:15.328
And we looked good together in front of Nagai.

174
00:23:15.734 --> 00:23:18.719
Of course, he is cool, but I will not give in.

175
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:25.022
Apparently you don't get it.
Didn't notice?

176
00:23:25.678 --> 00:23:28.558
Did you not understand what Nagai-kun was doing there?

177
00:23:29.214 --> 00:23:32.394
What will he think of us now,
when he sees us together?

178
00:23:32.803 --> 00:23:34.511
Sonoko-kun, I want to hate you.

179
00:23:34.847 --> 00:23:36.999
Then it will be much easier for me to live. *

180
00:23:37.581 --> 00:23:39.613
Is everything okay with your head?

181
00:23:45.159 --> 00:23:48.917
Don't skip!

182
00:23:49.426 --> 00:23:53.301
We're learning to swim, not sink!

183
00:23:53.371 --> 00:23:58.175
Kaoru-san is by far the worst
who came here.

184
00:23:59.207 --> 00:24:02.863
So, old woman, listen to me.

185
00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:07.370
You are my coach, and also a personal one.

186
00:24:08.848 --> 00:24:12.387
It's your fault that I swim like an axe.

187
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.988
I see...

188
00:24:21.027 --> 00:24:22.980
When?

189
00:24:25.902 --> 00:24:29.840
Understood.
Okay, be careful.

190
00:24:30.613 --> 00:24:32.777
Good night.

191
00:24:39.137 --> 00:24:41.441
Who's there, dad?

192
00:24:41,886 --> 00:24:45,316
Why doesn't he come?
- Wow, that doesn't sound like you.

193
00:24:45.702 --> 00:24:47.820
Sometimes I want to talk to him too.

194
00:24:48.133 --> 00:24:50.327
He says he will drop by for an o-bon (holiday).

195
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:53.015
Fatherless...

196
00:24:54.312 --> 00:24:56.873
Do not say that.

197
00:24:59.296 --> 00:25:02.609
You've been on pins and needles lately.

198
00:25:03.828 --> 00:25:06.279
Had a fight with Kaworu?

199
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.906
And I like him, he's so manly.

200
00:25:10.483 --> 00:25:13.576
Kaoru acts like a girl. *

201
00:25:29.617 --> 00:25:31.586
You will see!

202
00:25:53.776 --> 00:25:56.681
- *
- Wow!

203
00:25:56.713 --> 00:25:59.563
They stick well!

204
00:25:59.588 --> 00:26:01.969
*

205
00:26:01.994 --> 00:26:03.884
It's because * .

206
00:26:03.916 --> 00:26:07.329
Look how jealous Akeda-senpai is.

207
00:26:07.354 --> 00:26:10.057
Already the fire in the eyes is burning.

208
00:26:19.308 --> 00:26:22.339
I bet I'll outdrink you. *

209
00:26:53.236 --> 00:26:55.565
We start clapping when the fire starts.

210
00:29:20.805 --> 00:29:23.062
[Running - 10 laps]

211
00:29:25.937 --> 00:29:29.311
- Go all out.
- I'm trying.

212
00:29:30.508 --> 00:29:34.117
For a healthy guy, this is not enough.

213
00:29:35.211 --> 00:29:38.961
Actually, I still have to swim.

214
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:44,546
- My legs will fall off after this.
- Idiot!

215
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:48,172
You don't understand what you're exercising for?

216
00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:50.938
Do you think you'll make it to the Olympics without me?

217
00:30:13.994 --> 00:30:16.283
37...

218
00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:20.893
36...

219
00:31:01.887 --> 00:31:03.621
Nagai-kun...

220
00:31:03.658 --> 00:31:07.487
pays no attention to our
girls, although they are fun. *

221
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,442
It must be stressful for him.
- Because they often intersect?

222
00:31:11.489 --> 00:31:14.723
Yeah, it happens with people
that you don't want to see each other.

223
00:31:18.589 --> 00:31:22.034
- What did you think?
- Never mind.

224
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:47,862
Will you eat?

225
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:50,448
You ate something outside again?

226
00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:53.426
Here, put it on top.

227
00:31:58.378 --> 00:32:01.355
People don't slurp when they visit!

228
00:32:01.737 --> 00:32:04.174
I can't believe you're acting like this...

229
00:32:04.566 --> 00:32:06.374
Calm as a boa constrictor.

230
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.516
Far from it.

231
00:32:08.565 --> 00:32:10.140
I try my best.

232
00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:11.977
I am always serious.

233
00:32:12.031 --> 00:32:13.875
How can you not understand?

234
00:32:14.375 --> 00:32:17.047
I don't know how serious you are

235
00:32:17.072 --> 00:32:20.141
but how am I supposed to catch it
looking at your behavior?

236
00:32:21.094 --> 00:32:24.243
It doesn't bother me at all.

237
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:25,840
Stupid!

238
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,320
She must be ashamed.

239
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:42,195
Because I work so hard
and she chills.

240
00:32:46.736 --> 00:32:48.721
Never mind.

241
00:32:49.369 --> 00:32:51.885
Are you a little arrogant?

242
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,877
What are you doing with my car?

243
00:33:36.084 --> 00:33:39.334
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a breeze.

244
00:33:41.287 --> 00:33:42.912
Are you walking?

245
00:33:43,443 --> 00:33:46,326
Just started training.

246
00:34:14.714 --> 00:34:16.237
Bye bye!

247
00:34:24.116 --> 00:34:27.780
Disappear quickly.

248
00:34:30.576 --> 00:34:33.850
Only one of us will be the hero.

249
00:34:35.193 --> 00:34:39.076
I won't put up with
which I haven't been able to do yet.

250
00:34:49.912 --> 00:34:53.006
Why are you letting him in while I'm gone?

251
00:34:55.169 --> 00:34:57.013
And this and that.

252
00:34:57.239 --> 00:35:00.442
Don't you dare let him go again.
Understood?

253
00:35:00.857 --> 00:35:03.700
Don't worry like that.

254
00:35:04.693 --> 00:35:06.114
You understood?

255
00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.622
Understood?

256
00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:13.208
Everything is wrong.

257
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,958
One "yes" is enough.

258
00:36:22.234 --> 00:36:24.945
- Something happened?
- What do you want?

259
00:36:25.562 --> 00:36:29.281
- You don't look like yourself.
- Get out.

260
00:36:31.851 --> 00:36:34.453
And you don't smile.

261
00:36:34,633 --> 00:36:37,008
What are you sad about?

262
00:36:38.445 --> 00:36:43.085
Accepting your weaknesses is
first step towards improvement.

263
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,320
Don't comfort me.

264
00:36:45.711 --> 00:36:49.695
You can, of course, try
but you won't last long.

265
00:36:50.719 --> 00:36:52.906
Some new feeling.

266
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:55,878
Share it with me.

267
00:36:56.976 --> 00:36:58.484
I am not myself.

268
00:36:59.867 --> 00:37:02.203
I understand what it's like.

269
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:08,203
I want to learn how to swim.

270
00:37:08,484 --> 00:37:11,437
You have abilities.

271
00:37:11.648 --> 00:37:14.914
- I see it.
- Is it true?

272
00:37:15.133 --> 00:37:17.375
It is true.

273
00:37:17.469 --> 00:37:20.570
Your talent is visible to the naked eye.

274
00:37:27.796 --> 00:37:30.882
- Something wrong...
- What are you grumbling about?

275
00:37:30.914 --> 00:37:33.625
A haircut will help you "switch".

276
00:37:33.672 --> 00:37:38.664
I can see how you are going crazy
about that girl.

277
00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:43.664
It's time to change priorities.

278
00:37:43,898 --> 00:37:46,078
When you think about her again

279
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:48,148
look at this ribbon.

280
00:37:48.719 --> 00:37:52.062
- Don't let yourself go.
- And what will this ribbon do?

281
00:37:52.117 --> 00:37:54.023
Do you understand?

282
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,469
I'm going to tell her about it.

283
00:37:59.883 --> 00:38:02.578
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

284
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,851
Gran, what about the ribbon?

285
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,219
Little ones don't understand.

286
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,960
Senile!

287
00:38:23.289 --> 00:38:26.953
Don't think I'll appreciate your baldness.

288
00:38:29.523 --> 00:38:31.719
Listen carefully.

289
00:38:32.351 --> 00:38:34.672
We won't talk for a while.

290
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:38,453
I have hard training
before the Olympics.

291
00:38:39.422 --> 00:38:43.187
So when it'll be
hard and difficult for me

292
00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:46.726
I will remember us, looking at the ribbon.

293
00:38:52,594 --> 00:38:55,554
Most of all I don't like
being ignored.

294
00:38:56,328 --> 00:38:57,906
Do what you like.

295
00:38:57.953 --> 00:38:59.602
You think I care?

296
00:38:59.627 --> 00:39:01.039
I don't care.

297
00:39:01.064 --> 00:39:02.797
Don't care at all.

298
00:39:03.891 --> 00:39:07.274
Please do as you see fit.

299
00:39:09.656 --> 00:39:13.437
Don't talk to me politely, you bore.

300
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:19.383
- It's interesting.
He puts them in our box every day.

301
00:39:22.875 --> 00:39:25.922
Sonoko-kun, today I
looked at the ribbon three times.

302
00:39:25.969 --> 00:39:28.274
But even three times is already progress.

303
00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.297
Don't worry about my coach
she has a gold medal

304
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,266
- What is this?
- It's all scary.

305
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:43,203
Yesterday I saw a beautiful moon.
Sonoko-kun, can you see it from your window?

306
00:39:43,274 --> 00:39:45,313
And so every day.

307
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:51.827
Yesterday I had a dream about how I won
in upcoming competitions.

308
00:39:51.867 --> 00:39:54.789
You should agree, that it is shameful to see
such dreams.

309
00:39:54.906 --> 00:39:57.570
He went crazy, there's no help.

310
00:39:57.625 --> 00:40:00.735
Kaoru-kun doesn't give up...

311
00:40:00.805 --> 00:40:03.555
It's even worse if he was silent on the phone.

312
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,750
You don't even open envelopes.

313
00:40:06.133 --> 00:40:08.433
These are unhappy letters.

314
00:40:18.465 --> 00:40:21.742
Photo from our trip.

315
00:40:22.437 --> 00:40:25.070
The angle is not bad, but it looks ominous.

316
00:40:26.449 --> 00:40:28.963
Then he got drunk in the trash ...

317
00:40:28.988 --> 00:40:31.527
"Recklessness is the main enemy."

318
00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:03.125
Have you ever been in a sauna?

319
00:41:04.137 --> 00:41:07.941
Try it, it's very nice.

320
00:41:08.192 --> 00:41:11.223
Imagine first steaming in the sauna,

321
00:41:11.277 --> 00:41:14.356
and after that you'll drink cold beer!

322
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:58,402
They are from Ushikawa.

323
00:42:06.082 --> 00:42:07.777
What's happened?

324
00:42:09.192 --> 00:42:11.496
Nothing.

325
00:42:12.684 --> 00:42:14.988
Is it because of him?

326
00:42:18.574 --> 00:42:22.902
- Damn, who are you and where are you from?
- Hanai Kaoru from Hama School.

327
00:42:23.972 --> 00:42:28.519
"I'm Ushi Wakamaru from Ushikawa High.
- Stupid name.

328
00:42:29.559 --> 00:42:33.308
Doesn't matter. Do you hit on these girls?

329
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:35,254
Doesn't concern you.

330
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:38,027
Why did you make a face?

331
00:42:38.262 --> 00:42:41.637
One more word and you'll be sailing.

332
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:47,145
"Sonoko-kun, why are you running away from me?"
- Come on, stop.

333
00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:48.770
back off.

334
00:42:51,863 --> 00:42:55,262
He goes swimming with us.

335
00:42:55.902 --> 00:42:58.996
- Sorry.
- What are you apologizing for?

336
00:42:59.067 --> 00:43:00.926
You (kimi), don't apologize for him.

337
00:43:01.021 --> 00:43:05.310
- "Kimi" (familiar address)?
- I also go to the pool.

338
00:43:05.356 --> 00:43:08.777
- Hey, baldie.
- What?!

339
00:43:09.426 --> 00:43:14.112
Have you fallen for her?
Don't pretend, I see everything.

340
00:43:14.598 --> 00:43:18.762
Don't look with such lustful eyes
on my Sonoko.

341
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,699
Cause I want to puke right away.

342
00:43:26.711 --> 00:43:29.398
Well, sucked it?

343
00:43:29.781 --> 00:43:34.063
This is what happens when
you touch someone else's girl.

344
00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:40.925
Worthless.

345
00:45:31.186 --> 00:45:33.139
Tell me.

346
00:45:35.108 --> 00:45:36.732
Here?

347
00:45:50.116 --> 00:45:53.530
Nobody will bother us here.

348
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:09,709
Becaming an athlete...

349
00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:14.388
- Is it true, Mr. clown?
- Little by little...

350
00:46:17.006 --> 00:46:20.014
How's your girl (sono-ko)
Sonoko?

351
00:46:20.498 --> 00:46:22.662
Don't play with her name. *

352
00:46:35.216 --> 00:46:37.506
Have you touched her breasts?

353
00:46:38.067 --> 00:46:39.481
Kissed?

354
00:46:40.122 --> 00:46:42.130
Did you have your morning coffee with her?

355
00:46:42.926 --> 00:46:46.395
In my plans...

356
00:46:47.067 --> 00:46:49.255
You have me right here.

357
00:46:49.325 --> 00:46:50.567
Look!

358
00:46:51.223 --> 00:46:53.989
You don't notice me
even though I'm in front of you.

359
00:46:56.138 --> 00:46:58.185
I noticed.

360
00:47:06.693 --> 00:47:11.185
And how did I fall in love with such a mumbler?

361
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:14,114
Repeat.

362
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,630
Mumbler said.

363
00:49:01.488 --> 00:49:04.887
Damn, in these five minutes * .

364
00:49:06.051 --> 00:49:08.536
You could've confessed your love on the phone.

365
00:49:08.567 --> 00:49:10.724
Then I'll be here right away.

366
00:49:12.294 --> 00:49:14.685
You're in white today, right?

367
00:49:15.739 --> 00:49:17.669
We need to talk.

368
00:49:19.184 --> 00:49:20.911
All right, one time.

369
00:49:21.489 --> 00:49:23.450
Great place to make love. *

370
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,450
Something important?

371
00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:42.567
Sonoko-kun, let's get down to business.

372
00:49:42,668 --> 00:49:45,247
- Don't you understand yet?
- I'm talking to Sonoko.

373
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:49,394
What are you doing?

374
00:49:49.512 --> 00:49:51.691
- Are you dumb?
- Do not make fun!

375
00:49:52.551 --> 00:49:56.082
She's my girlfriend, as you can see.

376
00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.543
- You're out in the cold.
- Nagai, don't make me a fool!

377
00:50:00.629 --> 00:50:04.372
Don't bother Sonoko-kun again.

378
00:51:01.207 --> 00:51:03.895
- Is it true?
- It is true.

379
00:51:12.457 --> 00:51:15.137
- Why?
- Just because.

380
00:51:22.692 --> 00:51:25.379
Understood? Get away from her.

381
00:51:25.848 --> 00:51:28.606
- I understand.
- Understood?

382
00:51:28.631 --> 00:51:31.387
No, I understood something else.

383
00:51:32.207 --> 00:51:35.989
- You are dating.
- Well, so ... - What is it?

384
00:51:36,871 --> 00:51:38,340
I do not care.

385
00:51:38,676 --> 00:51:41,434
- We have mutual love.
- Don't care.

386
00:51:41.504 --> 00:51:42.981
Doesn't matter.

387
00:51:43.043 --> 00:51:44.457
Doesn't matter at all.

388
00:51:45.036 --> 00:51:47.129
- Let's go?
- Wait!

389
00:51:49.442 --> 00:51:51.582
Was that a joke?

390
00:51:55.137 --> 00:51:59.074
Stupid! And why did you call me here?

391
00:51:59.184 --> 00:52:01.293
You could have told me on the phone!

392
00:52:04.918 --> 00:52:07.082
Thought I'd be upset?

393
00:52:07.692 --> 00:52:09.465
Don't be  know-it-all!

394
00:52:42,691 --> 00:52:45,043
Maybe stop messing around with Kaworu?

395
00:52:45.238 --> 00:52:47.003
It's his choice.

396
00:52:47.059 --> 00:52:49.416
No one begged him on his knees.

397
00:52:49.441 --> 00:52:51.551
But he doesn't succeed.

398
00:52:52.512 --> 00:52:55.410
What a nasty girl...

399
00:52:55.981 --> 00:52:58.411
Just like her mother.

400
00:52:58.762 --> 00:53:01.707
And you fell down the stairs.

401
00:53:06.286 --> 00:53:08.293
How are you doing, Kaoru?

402
00:53:10.949 --> 00:53:14.715
- I'm ready for the Olympics, even tomorrow.
- Eat a watermelon.

403
00:53:16.082 --> 00:53:18.473
Everything inside me is on fire.

404
00:53:18.498 --> 00:53:20.887
Cool down until tomorrow.

405
00:53:31.332 --> 00:53:33.762
I can't delay!

406
00:53:34.082 --> 00:53:36.661
Feel better now, you moron?

407
00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:37.965
But...

408
00:53:39.059 --> 00:53:42.332
Look, it's not dirty here, you can eat.

409
00:55:20.169 --> 00:55:21.380
Hanai,

410
00:55:22.091 --> 00:55:25.856
will you swim with Nagai in competitions?

411
00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.309
Do not mind?

412
00:55:29.942 --> 00:55:31.598
It doesn't matter to me.

413
00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.778
Congratulations.

414
00:55:36.075 --> 00:55:38.028
Don't play with me...

415
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:40.075
I still have to study more.

416
00:57:24.437 --> 00:57:26.336
What's happened?

417
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,156
- Let's go together.
- OK.

418
00:57:39.015 --> 00:57:40.640
What do you want?

419
00:57:43.242 --> 00:57:45.039
Not hungry?

420
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,101
Not really.

421
00:57:59.547 --> 00:58:04.390
- Something with Sonoko, she is not at school.
- Yeah, what's wrong with her?

422
00:58:08.125 --> 00:58:10.797
Did you call me to talk about her?

423
00:58:11.273 --> 00:58:14.328
Just ask at school

424
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:17,476
rather than walk around.

425
00:58:19.382 --> 00:58:21.819
Her mother said she was staying at home.

426
00:58:21.906 --> 00:58:23.953
- Why?
- Don't know.

427
00:58:24.328 --> 00:58:28.242
You are her friend, but you don't worry at all.
- Shall we go bowling?

428
00:58:28.267 --> 00:58:29.821
It's closed. *

429
00:58:33.017 --> 00:58:35.727
You could just go to her house,
if you're so worried.

430
00:58:36.657 --> 00:58:38.688
You don't have the courage.

431
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:43,345
- You are coward.
- Agree.

432
00:58:44,368 --> 00:58:48,226
I understand that you want to present to her
gold medal, but not * ?

433
00:58:48.306 --> 00:58:50.915
A man can't do that.

434
00:58:52.626 --> 00:58:56.821
- Not funny.
- Okay, I'll go, I have more * .

435
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:56,163
Hey, where's Hanai?

436
00:59:58,218 --> 01:00:00,265
Got scared?

437
01:00:01.694 --> 01:00:04.046
Can you call Ushi?

438
01:00:04.827 --> 01:00:06.929
I'll be waiting outside.

439
01:00:25.947 --> 01:00:29.361
What are you standing for? Takeda-senpai is looking for you.

440
01:00:29.416 --> 01:00:32.689
"Sonoko-kun still missing?"
- Looks like it.

441
01:00:37.056 --> 01:00:39.103
Ririko,

442
01:00:40,158 --> 01:00:42,080
what do you think about me?

443
01:00:43,361 --> 01:00:46,205
You're cool.

444
01:01:02.703 --> 01:01:04.453
I'm participating *

445
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:08,447
Learn at least a little from our peers!

446
01:01:09.002 --> 01:01:12.486
If you're an athlete, how about showdown?

447
01:01:12.775 --> 01:01:14.346
Don't be stupid.

448
01:01:14,494 --> 01:01:18,096
Our school will die from shame if
we take you for an equal opponent.

449
01:01:19.471 --> 01:01:22.932
So, I asked whom she loves more.

450
01:01:23.439 --> 01:01:26.283
- I'm talking about Sonoko-kun.
- Don't lie!

451
01:01:26.494 --> 01:01:29.557
She said she would choose the one who wins.
- Really?

452
01:01:29.643 --> 01:01:32.134
- She likes strong guys.
And what she said about shaved heads?

453
01:01:32.299 --> 01:01:36.518
Forget it, she already did
bet on today's swim.

454
01:01:37.111 --> 01:01:38.846
I am also participating.

455
01:01:39.736 --> 01:01:41.540
And what about you?

456
01:02:22.623 --> 01:02:25.147
I have something to say
you before the swim.

457
01:02:30.218 --> 01:02:32.515
About Sonoko...

458
01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.718
It was staged.

459
01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:38.851
Nagai,

460
01:02:39.265 --> 01:02:43.187
you think i'm going to lose because of
"mental shock"?

461
01:02:56.249 --> 01:02:58.960
Kumihama High School.

462
01:02:59.155 --> 01:03:01.226
Number two.

463
01:03:01,343 --> 01:03:03,038
Shoji-kun.

464
01:03:03,101 --> 01:03:05,218
Takase High School.

465
01:03:05.921 --> 01:03:07.897
Number three.

466
01:03:07.999 --> 01:03:09.366
Nagai-kun.

467
01:03:09.499 --> 01:03:11.687
Hama High School.

468
01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:13.936
Number four.

469
01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:15.866
Hanai-kun.

470
01:03:15.905 --> 01:03:18.054
Hama High School.

471
01:03:18.421 --> 01:03:20.476
Number five.

472
01:03:20.538 --> 01:03:22.288
Ushi Wakamaru-kun.

473
01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:24.905
Ushikawa High School.

474
01:03:25.538 --> 01:03:27.616
Number six.

475
01:03:27.671 --> 01:03:29.437
Ojima-kun.

476
01:03:29.462 --> 01:03:31.491
Nishi-ga-ura high school.

477
01:06:02.601 --> 01:06:04.601
What happened to you?

478
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:07.179
I knew that you started it
because of a girl.

479
01:06:07,687 --> 01:06:11,460
- If you swam for yourself, then ...
- Gran... - Sit silently!

480
01:06:12.757 --> 01:06:15.187
Big goals aren't bad by themselves,

481
01:06:15,366 --> 01:06:18,413
but yours are simply out of touch with reality.

482
01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:21.804
Okay, do as you please.

483
01:06:22.756 --> 01:06:24.526
Are you leaving me out?

484
01:06:24.566 --> 01:06:27.358
Don't dump your dreams on me.

485
01:06:27.699 --> 01:06:30.699
Do not make me laugh.
What is left for me?

486
01:06:31.426 --> 01:06:33.574
Compete at the Olympics.

487
01:06:33.871 --> 01:06:35.996
Win a medal on your own.

488
01:06:36.543 --> 01:06:38.777
How? Sounds cool?

489
01:06:39.488 --> 01:06:42.707
I don't have many time left and I'm not going to
wait for nothing.

490
01:06:42.754 --> 01:06:45.707
Miki, leave that whiner
and let's go home!

491
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,426
Don't interfere!

492
01:08:06.996 --> 01:08:10.504
What are you doing? I'm not seeing you at all.
I miss you.

493
01:08:33.957 --> 01:08:36.558
Good afternoon
Sorry for no warning.

494
01:08:41.855 --> 01:08:46.746
Listen, sleeping so long and staying
indoors is bad for health.

495
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:49,144
It's like a greenhouse here.

496
01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:51.223
What are you hiding.

497
01:09:02.137 --> 01:09:03.832
Don't come.

498
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:05,652
Everything is over.

499
01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:07.621
End.

500
01:09:08.199 --> 01:09:10.902
I'm a laughing stock now.

501
01:09:11,543 --> 01:09:13,105
It's all because of you!

502
01:09:17,324 --> 01:09:19,848
Asshole, just die!

503
01:09:24.965 --> 01:09:27.121
I can't go to school.

504
01:09:32.456 --> 01:09:34.199
You want to go out with a fatty?

505
01:09:35.199 --> 01:09:37.418
This is your handiwork!

506
01:09:39.207 --> 01:09:41.378
Sonoko-kun, because you put some weight,

507
01:09:41,566 --> 01:09:43,496
changed nothing for me.

508
01:09:44.925 --> 01:09:48.183
You always like this!

509
01:09:48,854 --> 01:09:51,026
Said that fell in love with me,

510
01:09:51,332 --> 01:09:55,012
but immediately started to get angry,
when I wasn't interested

511
01:09:55.746 --> 01:09:59.137
You built all this for your own sake.

512
01:10:00.855 --> 01:10:03.816
Kaoru, you are selfish.

513
01:10:04,176 --> 01:10:07,168
You don't even think about how I feel.

514
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,941
It would be good for you to understand that
others have feelings too.

515
01:10:11.894 --> 01:10:13.965
See how big those cheeks are?

516
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:16.332
They contain my hatred for you!

517
01:10:17,457 --> 01:10:19,098
So much?

518
01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:22.355
Yes, I hate you as much as
you love me you.

519
01:10:22.558 --> 01:10:24.762
I hate you!

520
01:10:28.418 --> 01:10:29.840
And yet,

521
01:10:30.808 --> 01:10:32.402
My love...

522
01:10:33.355 --> 01:10:34.543
Love...

523
01:10:35.855 --> 01:10:36.949
Love...

524
01:11:29.238 --> 01:11:30.433
Mother...

525
01:11:32.098 --> 01:11:35.043
What will happen to me?

526
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,301
How to live on?

527
01:11:37,745 --> 01:11:40,026
What is my future?

528
01:12:22.902 --> 01:12:24.558
What?

529
01:12:28.457 --> 01:12:30.590
Thinking of something again?

530
01:12:31.426 --> 01:12:35.988
It's strange that you called me when
yesterday you ran away so fast.

531
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:38,949
We are breaking up.

532
01:12:39.668 --> 01:12:43.472
Yes, we've never been...
- I love another.

533
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:50,222
- I'm sorry for everything.
- I don't care.

534
01:12:52.082 --> 01:12:55.308
Sonoko-kun, are you honest with me?

535
01:12:57,394 --> 01:12:59,308
I'm serious.

536
01:13:01.793 --> 01:13:03.980
"We're breaking up."

537
01:13:04.832 --> 01:13:05.957
Say.

538
01:13:06.254 --> 01:13:08.598
- You don't want to date a fatty?
- I understand.

539
01:13:08.707 --> 01:13:10.394
I got it.

540
01:13:10.457 --> 01:13:11.558
I...

541
01:13:12,441 --> 01:13:15,129
I don't feel anything for you.

542
01:13:16.176 --> 01:13:19.074
I only think of myself.

543
01:13:19.824 --> 01:13:22.785
And I don't care about you.

544
01:13:26.082 --> 01:13:28.285
Let's end this.

545
01:13:29.644 --> 01:13:32.996
So that's how it is!
Yes, I knew it from the beginning.

546
01:13:33,863 --> 01:13:35,800
Don't try to stop me.

547
01:13:37,433 --> 01:13:39,183
It's already late.

548
01:13:51.734 --> 01:13:53.336
Good luck.

549
01:14:02.596 --> 01:14:05.283
Apparently, I was mistaken.

550
01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.783
Thought you were angry because

551
01:14:12.627 --> 01:14:14.853
that "your" Kaworu is with me.

552
01:14:17.158 --> 01:14:18.947
It turns out not.

553
01:14:19.924 --> 01:14:22.713
You just hated him so much,
that you transformed into "this".

554
01:14:24.025 --> 01:14:25.111
Bye bye.

555
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:45,001
Are you still at home?

556
01:17:45,104 --> 01:17:48,908
Don't act like a child, we're not your family.

557
01:17:48.955 --> 01:17:52.767
We have different blood.
- Gran, watch your tongue.

558
01:17:52.885 --> 01:17:55.486
That's right, don't speak for everyone.

559
01:17:57.893 --> 01:17:59.423
Don't you worry your head.

560
01:17:59.713 --> 01:18:02.689
Hubby, sucking up is your only strong suit.

561
01:18:32.721 --> 01:18:35.674
Excellent medal.

562
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:55,239
So you deceived me?

563
01:18:56.877 --> 01:18:59.775
Is this your gold medal?

564
01:18:59.908 --> 01:19:02.377
I am an Olympic athlete.

565
01:19:02.525 --> 01:19:05.213
The real thing.

566
01:19:16.596 --> 01:19:19.197
Gran, listen carefully.

567
01:19:21.872 --> 01:19:23.950
If a man tries,

568
01:19:23.975 --> 01:19:26.325
he will reach both the Moon and Mars.

569
01:19:27,403 --> 01:19:30,106
Until today, I was goldfish shit.

570
01:19:30.482 --> 01:19:32.215
But from now on...

571
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:35,505
you'll be the shit and I'll be the goldfish.

572
01:19:36.091 --> 01:19:37.497
Understood?

573
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:41,129
If you want to see me at the Olympics,
don't die. *

574
01:19:46.658 --> 01:19:48.955
Kaoru-san, you are so cool.

575
01:20:54.139 --> 01:20:55.592
What?

576
01:20:57,381 --> 01:21:00,349
Don't just stare at me.

577
01:21:01.349 --> 01:21:02.888
Not just.

578
01:21:04,951 --> 01:21:08,498
I'm looking at your face, it's important.

579
01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:14.771
As you wish.

580
01:21:19.849 --> 01:21:22.045
I'm in a skirt today.

581
01:21:23.803 --> 01:21:25.161
Do you understand?

582
01:21:27.943 --> 01:21:30.631
You love short skirts.

583
01:21:34.037 --> 01:21:35.857
Very much.

584
01:21:46.717 --> 01:21:49.123
You broke up by yourself.

585
01:21:52.139 --> 01:21:54.436
But you can't forget everything.

586
01:22:18.896 --> 01:22:20.310
Say something.

587
01:22:24.301 --> 01:22:26.895
Otherwise it will be awkward.

588
01:22:30.591 --> 01:22:33.646
- Sorry.
- One coffee, please.

589
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:49,450
Nagai-kun.

590
01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:51.528
Cool guy.

591
01:22:51.997 --> 01:22:53.552
Nice to meet.

592
01:23:05.652 --> 01:23:08.824
- Good...
- What's good?

593
01:23:11.121 --> 01:23:13.145
The reason for worry is gone.

594
01:23:14.004 --> 01:23:15.488
That is?

595
01:23:18.129 --> 01:23:19.777
May I have a cigarette?

596
01:23:30.778 --> 01:23:33.575
Indeed, good...

597
01:23:35.872 --> 01:23:37.075
You know I...

598
01:23:37.129 --> 01:23:40.606
really thought Kaoru was in love with you.

599
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:44,294
Happens.

600
01:24:04.567 --> 01:24:06.880
Sonoko, ask me.

601
01:24:11.005 --> 01:24:13.935
Oops, I can't tell.

602
01:24:15,614 --> 01:24:18,200
He is such a vulgar guy.

603
01:24:18.497 --> 01:24:19.880
Did you know?

604
01:24:24.395 --> 01:24:26.442
Not a simple fellow.

605
01:24:28.208 --> 01:24:30.770
I cannot even say such thing.

606
01:24:33.731 --> 01:24:35.223
Let's go.

607
01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:42.395
- Goodbye.
- Wait.

608
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:46,020
I...

609
01:24:47.778 --> 01:24:48.973
lost weight.

610
01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:53.114
I will be the best of the best.

611
01:24:54.176 --> 01:24:56.083
Nobody will compare to me.

612
01:24:56.512 --> 01:24:58.512
I will be professional.

613
01:24:58.653 --> 01:25:01.090
Nagai, I'll pass you too.

614
01:25:01.169 --> 01:25:03.153
I have training ahead of me.

615
01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:06.770
Don't talk nonsense.
Let's have some fun.

616
01:25:11.802 --> 01:25:14.239
Kaoru, look.

617
01:25:23.185 --> 01:25:24.896
Hey!

618
01:25:25.864 --> 01:25:28.106
Know when to stop!

619
01:25:29.755 --> 01:25:32.146
It doesn't matter if you're skinny or fat

620
01:25:32.224 --> 01:25:34.473
I won't give him to you.

621
01:26:57.347 --> 01:26:59.863
Do you know why I call you "the worst"?

622
01:26:59.888 --> 01:27:02.621
You make yourself look cool
but only in words not deeds...

623
01:27:02.707 --> 01:27:05.629
What do you want from me?

624
01:27:58.183 --> 01:28:01.082
You love me!

625
01:28:01.746 --> 01:28:03.668
You said it yourself.

626
01:28:18.814 --> 01:28:20.869
Now we're definitely breaking up.

627
01:28:21.119 --> 01:28:23.088
I won't even remember you.

628
01:28:23.588 --> 01:28:25.978
Good luck and goodbye.

629
01:28:57,683 --> 01:29:00,847
"I can't see you at all."

630
01:29:03.762 --> 01:29:05.050
"I miss you."

631
01:30:24.058 --> 01:30:26.222
Do you know that Hanai quit swimming?

632
01:30:26.818 --> 01:30:29.474
Finally some relaxing workouts.

633
01:30:29.677 --> 01:30:32.958
- Why did he leave?
- Says, he's tired.

634
01:30:55.138 --> 01:30:57.279
What does it mean?

635
01:31:02.939 --> 01:31:04.916
I can't do that.

636
01:31:06.307 --> 01:31:09.067
Let's keep some distance between us.

637
01:31:12.541 --> 01:31:16.197
This will be better for both of us.

638
01:31:24.833 --> 01:31:26.708
Or are you against my leave?

639
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:28.802
Are you serious?

640
01:31:29.888 --> 01:31:32.013
If so, then I can't stop you.

641
01:31:56.705 --> 01:31:59.244
What's up, Kaoru?

642
01:32:43.955 --> 01:32:45.330
You are bonkers.

643
01:32:46.541 --> 01:32:48.072
I love you.

644
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:58.000
