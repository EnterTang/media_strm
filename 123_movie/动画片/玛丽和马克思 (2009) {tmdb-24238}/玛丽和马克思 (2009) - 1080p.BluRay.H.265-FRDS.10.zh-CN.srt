但它们并不是在店里买来的真玩偶
They weren't the real ones you bought in the shops

She had to make all her own toys, and her favourites were Shrinkies -

她母亲告诉她 她只不过是个“意外”

34
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:20,749
拉尔夫爷爷告诉过玛丽 宝宝们是“蓄意”的

玛丽很想念爷爷

and often wondered why he had drunk ammonia.

47
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,540
很多事都令玛丽感到困惑

48
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:16,957
尤其是她母亲 维拉·洛林·丁寇

49
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:22,082
在玛丽看来 维拉总颤颤巍巍的
To Mary, Vera always seemed wobbly.

50
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,082
好一记发球 他出局了！

52

她蛋糕的主要成分也总少不了雪利酒

她告诉玛丽 这是一种给大人们喝的茶
She told Mary it was a type of tea for grown-ups

54

这茶呢还要不停地试喝

玛丽觉得她妈妈试喝得…实在是过头了

57
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:04,540
玛丽同样无法理解 为什么维拉老是“借”东西

58
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:09,665
昨天 她就在六号通道“借”了些鱼条
Yesterday, she borrowed some fish fingers from Aisle 6.

这公鸡是她父亲从高速公路边上发现的
Her father had found the rooster on the side of the freeway

64
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:48,790
那时它刚从一辆 给屠宰场运货的卡车上跌出来
after it had fallen off the back of a slaughter truck.

65
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,915
玛丽管他叫伊索

又到看“阿诺一家”的时候 她可喜欢“阿诺一家”了
lt was time to watch 'The Noblets'. She adored 'The Noblets'

67
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:03,165
因为他们都是棕色的 住在一个茶壶里

68
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,957
还有老多老多朋友

他现年44岁 痴迷“阿诺一家”
He was 44 and liked 'The Noblets'

81
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,457
因为这些卡通人物所处的社会结构 清楚明白
as they lived in a delineated and articulated social structure

82
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,832
而且始终连贯统一

83
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,790
也因为他们有老多老多的朋友

马克思无法入睡
Max had trouble sleeping

85
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:49,249

他在犹豫 是该上床数绵羊
He wondered if he should go to bed and count sheep

88
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:05,499
还是再吃一根巧克力热狗

89
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,957
他想那就两个一起来吧 可惜效果不佳

马克思厌恶周四-

141
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:36,124
这一天他要去参加每周举办的 “暴食者匿名见面会”
the day of his weekly Overeaters Anonymous meeting.

142
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,665
今晚 他尤其不安
And tonight he'd felt especially unsettled

143
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:44,290
因为就在去那里的路上 他已经解决了两根巧克力热狗
because he'd eaten two chocolate hotdogs on his way there.

144
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:44,541

吃巧克力可是坏规矩的事儿

150
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,124

152
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,040
马娇丽·巴特沃兹那奇怪的眼神
because of Marjorie Butterworth's strange glances.

153
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,749
下课
Class dismissed.

154
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:02,540
马克思读不懂别人的非语言暗示
Max had trouble understanding non-verbal signals.

155
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:06,374
调情对他来说 和慢跑一样陌生
Flirting was as foreign to him as jogging.

156
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,790
马克思觉得大多数人都令他迷惑
Max found most people very confusing.

157
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,749
但他想不到
But little did Max realise

158
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,374
这个夜晚即将变得更加迷离神秘
his night was about to become even more confusing and cryptic.

159
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:38,749
他读了玛丽的来信 四遍 然后采取了一贯的应对措施
He read Mary's letter four times and then did what he normally did

160
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:42,374
一旦遇到什么新奇而颇有压力的事 他就会这样
whenever confronted with something new and stressful.

161
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:59,499
马克思那渺小的存在再次变得飘忽不定
Max's fragile existence had once again become unsettled.

162
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,415
凝视窗外长达18小时后
And after staring out of the window for 1 8 hours

163
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,582
他终于下了决心

after my Overeaters Anonymous class.

167
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,540
我目前正在减肥
l am trying to lose weight

168
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,957
因为我的精神病医生 伯纳德·海兹霍夫说
because my psychiatrist, Dr Bernard Hazelhof,

169
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,624
健康的体魄相当于健康的精神
says a healthy body equals a healthy mind.

170
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,749
他说我的精神不太健康
He says my mind is not that healthy.

171
00:16:54,791 --> 00:17:00,290
你的画像是对你自身形象的有趣描绘
Your drawing is an interesting visual portrayal of yourself.

172
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,332
我之前从未遇到澳大利亚人
l have never met anyone from Australia.

173
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,415
首先 我来回答你的问题
Firstly, I will answer your question.

174
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:14,624
很不幸 在美国 宝宝不是从可乐罐里找到的
Unfortunately, in America, babies are not found in cola cans.

175
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,457
四岁时 我问过我的母亲
l asked my mother when I was four

176
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:22,874
她说 宝宝都是从拉比下的蛋里生出来的 （拉比：犹太教教士）
and she said they came from eggs laid by rabbis.

177
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,415
如果你是犹太人 就是天主教修女下的蛋
lf you aren't Jewish, they're laid by Catholic nuns.

178
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:31,415
如果你是无神论者 就是肮脏寂寞的妓女下的蛋
lf you're an atheist, they're laid by dirty, lonely prostitutes.

179
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:35,415
美国的宝宝就是这么来的
So this is where babies come from in America.

180
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,832
我的家里还有一条鱼
l share my home with a fish,

181
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:43,665
一些蜗牛 我给他们 取了一些著名科学家的名字

182
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:48,290
还有一只鹦鹉 叫“饼干”
...a parakeet called Mr Biscuit

183
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,207
最后一位 是一只猫 叫“哈儿”
and, finally, a cat called Hal.

184
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:57,915
“哈儿”是“哈口臭”的简称 它口臭的毛病不轻
'Hal' is an abbreviation for halitosis, from which he suffers.

185
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,457
一群野孩子用气枪打瞎了它一只眼睛
He followed me home after a gang of children

186
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,582
之后它就跟着我回到了家
shot his eye out with a beebee gun.

187
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,582
你有宠物袋鼠吗？
Do you have a pet kangaroo?

188
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:10,790
我出生后 父亲就不告而别 把我和母亲丢在基布兹（以色列集体农场）
When I was born, my father left my mother and me on a kibbutz.

189
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:14,207
我六岁时 她用我叔叔的枪自杀了
She shot herself with my uncle's gun when I was six.

190
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,040
你喜欢吃巧克力热狗吗？
Do you like chocolate hotdogs?

191
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:23,207
这个食谱是我发明的 现在就寄给你
l invented the recipe for them and can send it to you.

192
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:29,624
我小时候 想象了一个隐形的朋友 叫“拉维欧利”（意为“意大利方饺”）
When I was young, I invented an invisible friend called Mr Ravioli.

193
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,832
我的精神病医生说 我再也不需要他了
My psychiatrist says I don't need him anymore

194
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,665
所以他现在就坐在角落里 自己看书
so he just sits in the corner and reads.

195
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,666
【我好你也好】

198
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:54,707
我不懂 为什么他们要违法
l do not understand why people break laws.

199
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,957
烟屁股很不好 因为雨水会把他们冲到海里
Butts are bad because they wash out to sea

200
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:03,290
鱼儿会吸这些烟 然后尼古丁上瘾
and fish smoke them and become nicotine dependent.

201
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,874
我是在开玩笑 因为很显然
l am just joking because, of course,

202
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:11,915
香烟在水下是不可能点燃的
it is impossible for a cigarette to remain lit underwater.

203
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:16,624
另外 鱼儿也没有装打火机的口袋
Also, fish do not have pockets to keep cigarette lighters in.

证明了上帝只不过是我想象虚构出来的东西

我出门时常常塞上鼻子和耳朵

但是 我想我会理解、信任你

283
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,874
你看上去很开心 我猜你闻起来会像鲜虾

284
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:29,290

马克思希望玛丽能给他回信
Max hoped Mary would write again.

301
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:31,797
他一直想有个朋友

一个不是隐形的朋友 哪怕只是只宠物或者橡胶小人也好

305

【9天 6小时 47分钟后】

这疯子休想和自己的女儿 交上笔友 她想到
This nutcase would not be her daughter's penfriend, she thought.

309
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:12,246
这世上的丑恶已经够多的了
There was enough ugliness in the world.

310
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:14,998
再有一小时 玛丽就该放学回家了
Mary would be home from school in an hour -

311
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,960
还够时间喝杯“茶” 听听比赛 来舒缓一下神经
enough time for another cup of tea and a bit of cricket to soothe the nerves

312
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:24,380
够时间把关于马克思来信的可怕回忆从她那业已混乱的思绪中抹去
and dissolve the memory of Max's letter from her pickled mind.

313
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:29,385
【次日】

320
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:44,486

回见了 宝贝儿！
See ya, Toots!

322
00:27:47,156 --> 00:27:49,573
我的乖乖老天爷

323
00:28:03,753 --> 00:28:08,881
尽管马克思的来信 带着腥鱼头和霉橙皮的气味
Even though Max's letter smelt like fish heads and orange peel,

324
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:13,092
玛丽还是像品酒般品味着每一个单词
Mary drank his words like a bowl of alphabet soup

325
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:15,385
自从拉尔夫爷爷
and hadn't been this excited

326
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:20,848
从她鼻头上变出一个硬币以来 她还没有这么兴奋过
since Grandpoppy Ralph had found a coin up her nose.

327
00:28:20,891 --> 00:28:22,516
她马上就回了信
She wrote back immediately

328
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:27,103
信纸还是偷的包肉的油纸
on some butchers' paper she'd stolen from some chops.

329
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:31,231
亲爱的马克思 你能回信我真是太兴奋了
Dear Max, l'm so excited you've wroted back.

330
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:35,277
我想我爸妈可能不太喜欢你 所以以后呢
l don't think my parents like you so from now on

331
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,570
就把东西寄给我邻居莱恩·海斯洛浦吧
send stuff to my neighbour Len Hislop

332
00:28:38,571 --> 00:28:43,741
地址是韦弗利山 莱明顿大道 26号

333
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:46,744
他很老了 又失去了双腿
He's old with no legs.

334
00:28:46,745 --> 00:28:49,538
那是在二战时候被咬掉的
They got chew'd'ed off in World War ll

335
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:53,499
那会一些日本人把他们关在笼子里 吊在锯脂鲤上头
when some Japanese peoples kept him in a cage above piranhas.

336
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:58,920
锯脂鲤是些长了牙齿的金鱼
Piranhas are goldfish that have teeth.

337
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:06,009
他害怕外面的世界 这是一种病 学名叫“恐同症”哦
He's scared of outside, which is a disease called homophobia.

338
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:12,055
所以他每周给我50分 帮他取邮件
He's started giving me 50 cents a week to get his mail.

339
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:20,145
我存着钱 将来就可以在苏格兰买城堡嫁给一个叫厄尔·格蕾的人了
l'm saving to buy a castle in Scotland and marry a man called Earl Grey.

340
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:22,689
美国会播“阿诺一家”吗？
Do you get 'The Noblets' in America?

341
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,692
我最喜欢梵迪·诺博利
Well, my favourite Noblet is Vanity Noblet.

342
00:29:26,694 --> 00:29:32,572
他想成为所有人的朋友 甚至想跟男生做朋友！
He wants to be everyone's friend, even the boys'!

343
00:29:32,573 --> 00:29:36,240
你信里说 你没有朋友
ln your letter, you said you had no friends.

344
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:38,617
其实 我也没有
Well, neither do l.

345
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:45,415
昨天在学校 巴尼·克里福德 往我的火腿三明治上尿尿
Yesterday at school, Bernie Clifford weed on my spam sandwich

346
00:29:45,499 --> 00:29:49,668
还喊我“便便脸” 嘲笑我的胎记
and called me 'poo face' 'cos of my birthmark.

347
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,838
我真希望它能像创口贴一样撕下来
l wish I could peel it off like a bandaid.

348
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:56,173
他还笑话我 因为我没有纽扣
He also laughed 'cos I had no buttons.

349
00:29:56,175 --> 00:29:58,342
都是被伊索给啄掉的
Ethel pecked them off

350
00:29:58,344 --> 00:30:02,929
妈妈因为一直在试喝雪利 连线头都穿不过针眼
and Mum couldn't thread a needle 'cos she'd been testing the sherry

351
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,430
所以就用夹子充数了
so she used pegs instead.

352
00:30:07,726 --> 00:30:14,313
我回家之后 会爬进我的秘密地点 一直呆到晚饭时间
When I got home, I climbed into my secret place till dinner time.

353
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:17,190
其他小朋友还笑话我的发型

354
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,985
我的头发是爸爸剪的 因为妈妈说

355
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:23,112
那些理发师会把我的头发卖给中国佬

356
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,696
让他们拿去塞床垫

357
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:31,201
我老师 潘德格斯特夫人 说我应该多笑笑
My teacher, Mrs Pendergast, says I should smile more.

358
00:30:31,203 --> 00:30:36,205
我跟妈妈讲 于是 她就给我画了一张大大的笑脸
l told my mum and so she drawed a big smile on me.

359
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:42,210
我想潘德格斯特老师再也不会喜欢我了
l don't think Mrs Pendergast likes me anymore.

360
00:30:47,758 --> 00:30:52,593
差不多了 眼泪把字都弄花了

367
00:31:54,644 --> 00:31:56,644
你被别人嘲笑过吗？
Have you ever been teased?

368
00:32:00,982 --> 00:32:02,982
玛丽的来信勾起了太多回忆
Mary's letter triggered memories

369
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:06,693
太多已经被深深埋藏的回忆
Max had buried deep down in his shoes.

370
00:32:06,695 --> 00:32:11,113
我们围住他了 嘿嘿 小犹太佬 你得付出代价
We've got him cornered now. Hey. Jew-boy, you're gonna pay...

371
00:32:11,782 --> 00:32:16,617
尝尝这个！小犹太佬！
Take this, Jew-boy, Jew-boy, Jew-boy.

372
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:23,540
与往常一样 他用唯一的方式 来处理这个问题
And as usual, he coped in the only way he knew.

373
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,134
在吃掉了36根巧克力热狗…
And 36 chocolate hotdogs later...

374
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:41,387
和两小时的睡眠之后
..and after only two hours sleep,

375
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:48,685
马克思的不安渐渐退去 他突然灵机一动
Max's meltdown faded away and an idea popped into his brain.

376
00:32:50,771 --> 00:32:53,772
亲爱的玛丽·黛西·丁寇
Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

377
00:32:53,774 --> 00:32:59,736
谢谢你的来信 巧克力棒 莱明顿蛋糕和绒球
thank you for your letter, chocolate bar, lamington and pompom.

378
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:04,155
巧克力被压扁了 所以我把碎巧克力拌进牛奶和奶油
The chocolate got crushed, so I blended the bits with milk and icecream

379
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,867
现在正喝着
and now I am drinking it right now.

380
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:14,288
我想了很久 这个办法应该能让你不再受欺负
After much thought, I think I have a solution to your teasing.

381
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,457
告诉巴尼·克里福德 你的胎记是巧克力变的
Tell Bernie Clifford your birthmark is made of chocolate,

382
00:33:19,294 --> 00:33:21,419
【首席巧克力分配师】
也就是说 当你进天堂之后
which means when you get to heaven

383
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:25,089
你会掌管所有的巧克力
you will be in charge of all the chocolate.

384
00:33:25,091 --> 00:33:28,885
当然 这是个谎言 我不喜欢撒谎
This of course is a lie - I do not like lies -

385
00:33:28,886 --> 00:33:32,804
但在目前这种情况下 撒撒小慌是合理有利的
but in this case I think it will be of benefit.

386
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:36,766
我但愿自己能掌管所有巧克力
l wish I could be in charge of all the chocolate

387
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:41,477
可是 很显然 这不可能 因为我是无神论者
but, of course, I cannot because of my atheism.

388
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,314
我邻居艾维也是无神论者
My neighbour lvy is also an atheist.

389
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:52,819
她不太多话 却在每周六晚上 都给我炖好喝的汤
She doesn't talk much but makes me very good soup on Sunday nights.

390
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:54,863
她有些眼盲
She is partly blind

391
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:59,574
我偶尔会在汤里发现她掉的头发
and sometimes I find her hair in my soup. Eeugh!

392
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:07,080
我没有告诉她这些 因为伯纳德·海兹霍夫医生说这样很不礼貌
l do not tell her as Dr Bernard Hazelhof says this would be impolite.

393
00:34:07,082 --> 00:34:10,750
以下是我其他晚餐的菜单
Here is a list of what I eat on the other nights.

399
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:29,432
周六晚上 我会自创一些食谱
On Saturday nights I create my own recipes.

400
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:33,977
上周 我发明了“灌装意面汉堡”
Last week I invented canned spaghetti hamburgers.

401
00:34:33,978 --> 00:34:37,396
食谱犹如数学公式
Recipes are like mathematical equations.

402
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:44,360
伯纳德·海兹霍夫医生说 我绝对不能比我家冰箱重
Dr Bernard Hazelhof told me you should never weigh more than your refrigerator

403
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:49,280
也绝不能吃比我脑袋更大的东西
and to never eat anything bigger than your head.

404
00:34:49,282 --> 00:34:53,242
我有次还是吃了一个 比我脑袋还大的西瓜
l once ate a watermelon bigger than my head

405
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:56,286
不过不是一口吃下
but not all at once.

406
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:00,165
你有没有什么减肥的好办法？
Do you have any weight loss suggestions?

407
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:03,292
我那“暴食者匿名见面会” 似乎无甚成效
My Overeaters Anonymous meetings don't seem to be working

408
00:35:03,293 --> 00:35:06,419
只会叫我徒增紧张
and just make me tense.

409
00:35:12,926 --> 00:35:16,260
要是世上也有“肥仙”就好了
lt would be good if there was a 'Fat Fairy' .

410
00:35:18,055 --> 00:35:22,724
她应该和牙仙差不多 只是抽走的是脂肪
She would be a bit like the Tooth Fairy but would suck out your fat.

411
00:35:27,646 --> 00:35:33,483
艾维说自己只是“有点”盲 可我觉得是相当的
lvy says she is only a 'little bit' blind but I think she is very blind.

412
00:35:33,484 --> 00:35:37,361
她应该像其他那些视力障碍的人一样 弄根拐杖
She should get a cane like other vision-impaired people.

413
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:40,864
她可以把仗尖真的弄尖
She could make the end pointy.

414
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:43,407
顺便收收垃圾
and collect rubbish at the same time.

415
00:35:44,784 --> 00:35:48,703
我估计真会写信给市长 提提这个建议
l think I will write a letter to the Mayor and suggest this.

416
00:35:48,704 --> 00:35:52,413
他一定会很惊喜
He will be very impressed.

417
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:57,752
艾维说她不需要拐杖 因为她嗅觉灵敏
lvy says she doesn't need a cane because she has a good sense of smell.

418
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,924
她说就算把眼睛闭上 她也能找到我
She says she could find me with her eyes stapled shut.

419
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:09,427
因为我闻起来有甘草和旧书的气味
She says I smell like liquorice and old books.

420
00:36:13,391 --> 00:36:18,894
我觉得她闻起来像止咳药水和小便
l think she smells like cough medicine and urine.

421
00:36:18,895 --> 00:36:20,853
我从没对她这么说过
l have never told her this

422
00:36:20,855 --> 00:36:26,358
因为伯纳德·海兹霍夫医生说 这样会很不礼貌
as Dr Bernard Hazelhof said this would also be impolite.

423
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,031
别人总觉得我反应迟钝 行为粗鲁
People often think I am tactless and rude.

424
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:42,704
我想不通 做个诚实的人 怎么会…不妥当
l cannot understand how being honest can be...improper.

425
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:48,500
或许正因如此我才一个朋友也没有
Maybe this is why I don't have any friends

426
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:50,377
当然了 除你之外
of course except for you.

427
00:36:51,462 --> 00:36:54,755
交一个知心朋友是我人生的三大目标之一
A real friend has been one of my three goals in life.

428
00:36:56,758 --> 00:37:03,179
其他两个目标是集齐全套阿诺玩偶 买够吃一辈子的巧克力
The other two are to own every Noblet and a lifetime supply of chocolate.

429
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,181
【人生目标：1 朋友（不是隐形的） 2 阿诺一家；3 巧克力】
life goals:friend (not invisible) noblets, chocolates

430
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:09,767
伯纳德·海兹霍夫医生说 有目标是好事
Dr Bernard Hazelhof says it is good to have goals

431
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:14,897
但我这样愚蠢的目标不算
but not stupid ones like mine.

432
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:17,273
我暂时想不出还有什么好跟你说的了
l have now run out of things to tell you.

433
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,485
请早日回信
Please, write soon.

434
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:28,532
你的美国朋友 马克思·杰瑞·霍洛沃兹
Your friend in America, Max Jerry Horowitz.

435
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:32,953
附注 笑不起来也没关系
PS. Do not worry about not smiling.

436
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:35,538
我的嘴巴也很少笑
My mouth hardly ever smiles

437
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:40,333
但并不意味着我的脑子不笑
but it does not mean I am not smiling inside my brain.

438
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:46,754
附附注 随信附上一个飞盘
PPS. Please find enclosed a frisbee,

439
00:37:46,756 --> 00:37:50,091
一些“入口爆”巧克力 你得就着可乐喝
some Chocolate Pop Rocks, which you should eat with cola,

440
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:56,137
还有一只我从国家地理杂志上 临摹下来的海龟
and an illustration of a turtle from one of my National Geographics.

441
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:01,725
附附附注 你知道海龟还能用肛门呼吸吗？
PPPS. Did you know that turtles can breathe through their anuses?

442
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:07,938
亲爱的马克思
Dear Max,

443
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,982
我告诉巴尼·克里福德
when I told Bernie Clifford

444
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:13,901
我在天堂里会掌管所有的巧克力 而他一块也吃不到
l'll be in charge of all the chocolate in heaven and he wouldn't get any,

445
00:38:13,903 --> 00:38:15,362
他就哭鼻子了
he cried.

446
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:22,575
我还在他常玩的沙坑里埋了点狗屎
l also hide'd some dog's poo in his bit of the sandpit.

447
00:38:22,576 --> 00:38:26,870
你的建议棒极了 我现在有了一份发小册子的工作
Your advice was great and l've got a job delivering pamphlets

448
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:30,164
这样我就能存钱去看你了
so I can save to come and see you.

449
00:38:30,165 --> 00:38:32,290
听你说自己很胖 我很难过
l am sad to hear you are fat.

450
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:36,711
妈妈也说我胖 长大了肯定像头小雌牛
Mum says I am fat too and l'm growing up to be a heifer,

451
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:40,590
我想那应该是一种奶牛吧
which I think is a type of cow.

452
00:38:40,591 --> 00:38:45,051
也许你可以吃一些 和周几首字母一样的东西
Maybe you should only eat things beginning with the letter of each day.

453
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:47,594
比如周一（首字母M） 就可以吃
On Mondays you could only eat

454
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:53,349
奶昔、软糖还有…芥末
milkshakes, marshmallows and...mustard.

455
00:38:58,605 --> 00:39:03,274
我生日那天 妈妈给我做蛋糕 爸爸送我照相机
For my birthday, my Mum baked a cake and Dad gave me a camera.

456
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,903
希望你能喜欢我寄去的照片
l hope you like the photos I sent.

457
00:39:07,904 --> 00:39:11,363
第一张是伊索 它吃了箔片坏了肚子
The first one is of Ethel, who ate some tinsel.

458
00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:13,991
第二张是我自己
The next one is one of myself

459
00:39:13,992 --> 00:39:19,162
是在喝着可乐 吃完入口爆巧克力之后拍的
after I ate the Chocolate Pop Rocks with the cola, like you said.

460
00:39:19,163 --> 00:39:21,204
接下来是莱恩
Next is Len.

461
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:27,710
他还在努力不被外界吓到 努力征服“恐同症”
He's still trying hard not to be afraid of outside and conquer his homophobia.

462
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:34,882
然后是坐在小棚屋里的爸爸
The next one is of dad in his shed,

463
00:39:34,884 --> 00:39:38,177
这个呢 是有一次
and then one of the times I covered mum

464
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:42,305
我趁妈妈睡着 给她贴上了戒烟用的小贴纸
while she was asleep in her stickers that help her stop smoking.

465
00:39:42,307 --> 00:39:46,684
下一张 是我的头发被弹簧玩具缠住
Next, when I got my slinky caught in my hair.

466
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:51,645
然后是索尼挖出了他妻子 雪儿
Then one of the times Sonny digged up his wife, Cher.

467
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:58,443
最后一张 是我的邻居 达米·波波多波罗斯
And, finally, a photo of my other neighbour Damian Popodopolous.

468
00:39:58,485 --> 00:40:02,654
他是希腊人 闻起来像柠檬味的洗涤液
He's a Greek and smells like lemon dishwashing liquid

469
00:40:02,656 --> 00:40:08,076
他的皮肤光滑得像汤匙的背面
and his skin is smooth, like the back of a spoon.

470
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:14,288
妈妈说 他是个中东佬 而且口吃 连自己的姓他都说不好
Mum says he's a wog and has a stutter and can't even say his own surname.

471
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:19,584
妈妈还说只有给他后脑勺来一下
She says you have to hit him on the back of the head

472
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:20,961
他才能把名字说顺溜
to get his words out.

473
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,920
波…波…波波多波罗斯
P-P-P-P...Popodopolous.

474
00:40:22,964 --> 00:40:27,299
我希望他是我男朋友 那样我们就可以爱上对方 还能做爱爱
l wish he was my boyfriend and we can be in love and do sexing

475
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,176
就像凯瑟琳·拉姆齐 在自行车棚那儿跟我说的
like Katherine Ramsay told me behind the bike shed.

476
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,471
她说 做爱爱就两个人脱得“赤果果”
She said it's when two people go 'nuddy'

477
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,056
然后擦来擦去 生宝宝
and rub on each other to make babies.

478
00:40:37,058 --> 00:40:41,810
我说她是个骗子 死后会下地狱 再被当成烤肉烤
l told her she's a liar and would go to hell and burn like toast

479
00:40:41,812 --> 00:40:44,688
因为宝宝是从啤酒杯里出来的
'cos babies really come from beer glasses

480
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:49,066
还有拉比、修女 “鸡女”他们下的蛋里出来的
and eggs laid by rabbits and nuns and 'prosti-tubes'.

481
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,151
她说女人是被搞大了肚子
She said ladies get knocked up

482
00:40:51,152 --> 00:40:54,320
然后让宝宝在肚子里烘上两年
and bake babies in their stomachs for 2 years

483
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:58,116
直到最后宝宝才从“阴道”里喷出来 满身是血和罐装意大利面
till they spurt out their 'vag-eye-ners' with blood and tinned spaghetti.

484
00:40:59,326 --> 00:41:02,577
马克思 你有女朋友吗 或者一些妻子？
Have you got a girlfriend, Max, or some wives?

485
00:41:02,578 --> 00:41:05,078
你做过爱爱吗？
Have you done sexing?

486
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,497
情人节就快到了
Valentine's Day is soon

487
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:11,626
我想送礼物给达米 这样他就会爱上我了
and I want to give Damian a present so he can love me.

488
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,794
你能解释什么是爱情 还有怎样才能被“爱到”吗？
Can you explain love and how I can be 'lover'd'?

489
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,716
再一次 玛丽的来信引发了他的焦虑症
Once again, Mary's letter had triggered an anxiety attack.

490
00:41:22,177 --> 00:41:24,344
马克思对爱情一无所知
Max knew nothing about love.

491
00:41:24,346 --> 00:41:28,306
爱情对他来说 就如潜水一样陌生
lt was as foreign to him as scuba diving

492
00:41:28,307 --> 00:41:32,434
而且他还有过一段不堪回首的经历
and he'd had an appalling history of getting it all wrong.

493
00:41:33,311 --> 00:41:34,936
有一次情人节
One Valentine's Day

494
00:41:34,937 --> 00:41:39,332
他送给塞尔达·格鲁尼克一份礼物 他确信这份礼物是合宜的
he'd given Zelda Glutnik a gift he was sure was appropriate.

495
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:40,232
【猫科直肠体温计】

他送给塞尔达·格鲁尼克一份礼物 他确信这份礼物是合宜的
he'd given Zelda Glutnik a gift he was sure was appropriate.

496
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:41,233
【猫科直肠体温计】
felin rectal thermometer

497
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,948
马克思唯一的床上伴侣
The only companion that had ever warmed Max's bed

498
00:41:49,991 --> 00:41:52,116
是他的暖水袋
was his hot water bottle.

499
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:54,868
浪漫和爱情
Romance and love

500
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,163
太过神秘 对此他早已缴械投降
was a mysterious language he'd given up on.

501
00:41:58,873 --> 00:42:02,082
要是玛丽只是问他烤箱的工作原理
lf only Mary had asked how a toaster works

502
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:05,626
或者只是让他解释混沌理论 那该多好
or asked for an explanation of the Chaos theory.

503
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:10,172
要是爱情也有公式 那该多好
lf only there was a mathematical equation for love.

504
00:42:11,758 --> 00:42:15,593
他不停地吃 不停地想
He kept eating and thinking.

505
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,902
【纽约中央公园】
central park new York

506
00:42:30,565 --> 00:42:36,609
但爱情不像马克思的魔方 爱情永远也没法破解
But love was not like Max's Rubik's Cube. lt could not be solved.

507
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:40,196
无论他如何分析爱情 结果都不尽如人意
No matter how he analysed it, the results were negative.

508
00:42:40,614 --> 00:42:42,448
滚开 变态！
Beat it, creep!

509
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:45,866
他能感受到爱情 却无法言表
He felt love but couldn't articulate it.

510
00:42:45,868 --> 00:42:50,287
爱情的逻辑对于他来说 就像…沙拉三明治一样不可理喻
lts logic was as foreign to him as... as a salad sandwich.

511
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,790
星星倒显得更有意义
The stars made more sense.

512
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:05,216
12号 你有没有回过话？完毕
12, have you responded to the call? Over.

513
00:43:05,217 --> 00:43:08,634
焦虑和压力太过巨大
The anxiety and stress were too much.

514
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:14,764
神秘莫测的爱情终于胜利 马克思的大脑就此罢工
The inscrutability of love finally won, and Max's brain gave in.

515
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:23,873
【纽约时报-弱智肥男被举重机吊下！】
obese retarded man cranded out!

516
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,483
他被确诊为患有重度抑郁和肥胖
He was diagnosed with severe depression and obesity

517
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:33,029
此后八个月 他住院治疗 卧床不起
and spent the next 8 months institutionalised and bedridden.

518
00:43:33,156 --> 00:43:36,407
药山药海吃得他稀里糊涂
They marinated him in a cocktail of drugs

519
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:40,118
常规的“治疗”搞得他七荤八素
and performed the usual 'therapeutic' procedures.

520
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,125
与此同时 玛丽越等越奇怪
Meanwhile, Mary wondered and waited.

521
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:54,005
或许马克思的打字机没墨了
Maybe Max's typewriter had run out of ink.

522
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:57,882
【纽约时报-全美油墨告急 联合国出面干预】
或许全美国都没墨了
Maybe America had run out of ink.

523
00:43:58,468 --> 00:44:00,885
或许他的宠物已经把他给吃了
Maybe his pets had eaten him.

524
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:04,554
又或许都是因为自己
Maybe it was her.

525
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:09,183
自己是不是问太多、话太无聊、人…太丑？
Was she too demanding, too boring, too...ugly?

526
00:44:17,316 --> 00:44:21,318
她满腔愤懑、疑惑、自厌
Filled with anger, confusion and self-loathing,

527
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:26,238
玛丽试图彻底抹去 所有与她朋友相关的记忆
Mary tried to erase the memory of her friend forever.

528
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,244
【八个月后】
eight months later

529
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:16,904
马克思痊愈了
Max had recovered.

530
00:45:16,905 --> 00:45:21,824
生活重归平衡 安全而相称
And life was balanced, safe and symmetrical once again.

531
00:45:24,578 --> 00:45:29,080
但对玛丽 他仍念念不忘
But Mary still lingered in his mind.

532
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:31,916
一方面 他想立刻给玛丽回信
Half of him wanted to write to her immediately.

533
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:36,419
另一方面 他不想自己 到头来又沦落成精神病
The other half didn't want to end up a mental patient again.

534
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,506
【爱的毒药】
至少他还有个朋友 拉维欧利
At least there was always Mr Ravioli to be friends with.

535
00:45:41,507 --> 00:45:44,550
选他当朋友可安全多了
He was a much safer option.

536
00:45:45,553 --> 00:45:49,513
他好奇着 玛丽现在在做什么
He wondered what Mary was doing right now.

537
00:45:50,431 --> 00:45:53,182
但玛丽的生活远未如意
But she was far from content

538
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:59,312
她正一个人 拼命干活 多多攒钱 未雨绸缪
and struggled on by herself, saving her money for a rainy day.

539
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:09,027
对马克思来说 生活又回到了老路上
Life went on as usual for Max

540
00:46:09,029 --> 00:46:12,948
但尽管他追求生活的秩序与稳定
and even though he opted for order and stability,

541
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:16,408
不幸却总是徘徊左右
misfortune was never far away.

542
00:46:45,725 --> 00:46:49,727
万幸的是 对他过失杀人的指控被驳回
Luckily, his manslaughter charges were dismissed.

543
00:46:49,728 --> 00:46:52,687
因为他早就被贴上了“智力不足”的标签
because he was labelled mentally deficient

544
00:46:52,689 --> 00:46:56,900
所以与大部分人不同 他也就没有杀害哑剧表演家的…
and unlikely to have a motive for killing a mime artist...

545

她的世界还远未完美

于是玛丽决定去上大学 并致力于精神疾病的研究

l know love upsets you so I won't go on about it.

717
01:03:11,965 --> 01:03:16,509
我只是想说 很显然 谈情说爱并不适合我
All I want to say is that love is obviously not for me.
