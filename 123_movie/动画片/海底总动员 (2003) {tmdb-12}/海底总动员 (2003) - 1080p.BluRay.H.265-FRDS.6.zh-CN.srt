00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,750
-哇  -嗯
- Wow. - Mmm.

6
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,890
-哇  -嗯哼
- Wow. - Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,060
-哇  -是的  马林
- Wow. - Yes, Marlin.

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,190
我看到了  这真是太美了
No, I see it. It's beautiful.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,760
记得么  姗姗  当你说你想看到这个海洋的景色的时候...
So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view...

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,970
没想到我们会搬到海边来住  想过吗?
you didn't think you'd get the whole ocean, did you?

11
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,810
喔  耶  这里可是鱼的自由天地啊
Oh, yeah. A fish can breathe out here.

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,780
你说你老公我  说话算不算数啊?
Did your man deliver, or did he deliver?

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,110
-算数  行了吧  -我可是费了不少波折的啊
- My man delivered. - And it wasn't so easy.

14
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,450
因为有许多其他的小丑鱼也觊觎这块地方
Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.

15
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,920
你最好相信这点...  他们谁不想住这啊
You better believe they did... every single one of them.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,980
嗯  你做得很好
Mm-hmm. You did good.

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,650
还有邻居们是在是太棒了
And the neighborhood is awesome.

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,330
那么  你喜欢这里  是不是?
So, you do like it, don't you?

19
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,830
是的  是的  我喜欢  我喜欢  我真的很喜欢这里
No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it.

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,810
但是  马林  我知道住在这里会很惬意...
But, Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable...

21
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,110
伴随着大学校和这美妙的风景...
with the great schools and the amazing view...

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,920
但是我们真的需要这么大的地方吗?
but do we really need so much space?

23
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,050
姗姗  亲爱的  我们在说我们的孩子们
Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about.

24
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,250
他们应该得到最好的东西  看  看  看
They deserve the best. Look, look, look.

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,520
他们醒来  把他们小小的脑袋从这里探出来...
They'll wake up, poke their little heads out...

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,430
然后他们看到了一只鲸鱼!  就在他们卧房的窗户外面
and they see a whale! Right by their bedroom window.

27
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,620
然后他们看到了一只鲸鱼!  就在他们卧房的窗户外面
and they see a whale! Right by their bedroom window.

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,960
嘘  你会吵醒孩子们的
Shh. You'll wake the kids.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,790
喔  好的  好的
Oh, right, right.

30
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,300
噢  看  他们还在梦乡中
Aw, look. They're dreaming.

31
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,500
我们还要给他们起名字
We still have to name them.

32
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,310
你现在想给所有这些孩子起名字?
You want to name all of them right now?

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,610
好吧  我们把这一半叫做小马林...
All right, we'll name this half Marlin Junior...

34
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,770
这一半叫做小姗姗
and this half Coral Junior.

35
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,380
-好了  我们就这么决定了  -我喜欢尼莫这个名字
- OK, we're done. - I like Nemo.

36
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,180
尼莫  我们只能选其中的一个叫尼莫...
Nemo. We'll name one Nemo...

37
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,780
但是我愿意把其他的都叫做小马林
but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Junior.

38
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,190
只要一想  用不了几天...
Just think, in a couple of days...

39
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,720
-我们就要当爸爸妈妈了  -是啊
- we're going to be parents. - Yeah.

40
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,390
他们要是不喜欢我怎么办?
What if they don't like me?

41
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,960
-马林  -不  是真的
- Marlin. - No, really.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,960
这里有400多个蛋  按机率来算总会有一个会喜欢你的
There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one will like you.

43
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,300
怎么了?
What?

44
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,970
-你还记得我们是怎么认识的吗?  -我不想记起来了
- You remember how we met? - I try not to.

45
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,480
那好  我记得  对不起  小姐...
Well, I remember. "Excuse me, miss...

46
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,980
你能帮我看一下我嘴唇上是否有个鱼钩?
"can you check and see if I have a hook in my lip?"

47
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,380
你靠近一点呀  因为它还在晃动着
You got a little closer because it was wiggling.

48
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,550
-走开  走开!  -我来啦  美人在这呢
- Get away, get away! - Here he is. Cutie's here.

49
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,520
大家都去哪了?
Where did everybody go?

50
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,390
姗姗  快回房子里
Coral, get inside the house.

51
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,340
不  姗姗  别动  孩子们不会有事的
No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine.

52
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,970
快进去...  你快点  现在就进去
Just get inside... You, right now.

53
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,610
不!  噢!
No! Ow!

54
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,390
姗姗!

55
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,870
姗姗?
Coral?

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,370
姗姗?
Coral?

57
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,510
姗姗?
Coral?

58
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,290
姗姗?

59
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,990
姗姗?

60
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,550
好了  好了  好了
There, there, there.

61
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,080
没事了  爸爸在这里
It's OK. Daddy's here.

62
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,990
爸爸找到你了
Daddy's got you.

63
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,360
我保证  我不会再让你出什么事了...
I promise, I will never let anything happen to you...

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,160
尼莫

-你需要休息一下吗?  -不

78
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,560
有时候你会分辨不清  因为这个地区有急流
Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid rushes to the area.

79

There's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years.

88
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,850

91
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,030
-好的  -快擦

92
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,730
-好了  擦完了  -有一点没擦到
- OK, I'm done. - You missed a spot.

93
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,790
-哪?  -那里

94
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,740
哈哈!  就是那  还有这

好了  我们都很激动
All right, we're excited.

96
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,680
第一天去上学  我们走
The first day of school. Here we go.

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,680
我们要学一些知识
We're ready to learn to get some knowledge.

98
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,120
对于海洋我们要记住哪一点?
What's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?

99
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,590
-它并不安全  -好孩子
- It's not safe. - That's my boy.

100
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,890
首先  我们要检查一下是否畅通无阻
First, we check to see that the coast is clear.

101
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,330
我们出去...回来
We go out... and back in.

102
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,660
我们出去...  回来

104
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,600
有的时候  甚至你要来回四次...
And sometimes, if you want to do it four times...

105
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,000
-老爸...  -好吧  我们走  孩子
- Dad... - All right, come on, boy.

106
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,800
可能我在学校的时候  我会见到鲨鱼
Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark.

107
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,510
-我对这点表示非常的怀疑  -你曾经见到过鲨鱼吗?
- I highly doubt that. - Have you ever met a shark?

108
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,210
没有  我也不想见到
No, and I don't plan to.

109
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,450
-这些海龟有多大了?  -我不知道
- How old are sea turtles? - I don't know.

110
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,180
隔壁的山笛叔叔说...
Sandy Plankton from next door...

111
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,120
他说这些海龟已经活了大约100年了
he says that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old.

112
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,560
他说这些海龟已经活了大约100年了
he says that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old.

113
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,860
如果我见到海龟的话  我会问他的
lf I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him.

114
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,830
在我和鲨鱼谈完话以后  好吗?
After I'm done talking to the shark, OK?

115
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,430
哇!  等一下  等红灯亮再过
Whoa! Hold on. Wait to cross.

116
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,460
哇!  等一下  等红灯亮再过
Whoa! Hold on. Wait to cross.

117
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,690
抓住我的鳍
Hold my fin.

118
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,070
老爸  你又要像上次在宠物公园一样...
Dad, you're not going to freak out...

119
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,090
大惊小怪吧
like you did at the petting zoo, are you?

120
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,900
看好那只海螺  他正要向你扑过来
That snail was about to charge.

121
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,380
嗯  我在想我们要去哪
Hmm. I wonder where we're supposed to go.

122
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,900
再见  妈妈!
Bye, Mom!

123
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,040
放学后我会去接你们
I'll pick you up after school.

124
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,780
哈哈!
Ha ha!

125
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,880
快  你们这些家伙  不要!  把它还给我!
Come on, you guys, stop it! Give it back!

126
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,910
来  我们去那边
Come on, we'll try over there.

127
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,320
对不起  这里是见老师的地方吗?
Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?

128
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,880
喔  看看是谁从海葵里出来了
Well, look who's out of the anemone.

129
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,060
是的  你们很惊讶  我知道
Yes. Shocking, I know.

130
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,930
-玛蒂  是不是?  -马林
- Marty, right? - Marlin.

131
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,120
-鲍勃  -柯特

132
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,160
比尔  嘿  你是个小丑鱼
Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish.

133
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,760
你很搞笑  对不对?  给我们讲个笑话
You're funny, right? Tell us a joke.

134
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,100
-耶  -耶
- Yeah. - Yeah.

135
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,040
那个  事实上  这通常是个误解
Well, actually, that's a common misconception.

136
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,600
小丑鱼不会比其他鱼搞笑的
Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish.

137
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,630
-来吧  小丑  -来些有趣的
- Come on, clownie. - Do something funny.

138
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,150
好吧  我知道一个段子
All right, I know one joke.

139
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,240
有一个软体动物  知道吗?  他向大海走过去...
There's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea...

140
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,340
他不是走过去的  他是游过去的
He doesn't walk up, he swims up.

141
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,250
事实上  软体动物是不能动窝的
Actually, the mollusk isn't moving.

142
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,850
他就待在原地  然后那个海参...
He's in one place, and then the sea cucumber...

143
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,360
那个  他们...我弄混了
Well, they... I'm mixed up.

144
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,120
有一个软体动物  和一个海参
There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.

145
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,170
哎呀  我说乱了...
None of them were walking, so forget that l...

146
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,000
快离开那片院子
Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johannsen's yard now!

147
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,400
-哇!  -好吧  你们这些小家伙!
- Whoa! - All right, you kids!

148
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,500
喔  你们想往哪跑?
Ooh, where'd you go?

149
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,700
老爸  我也可以去玩吗?  可以吗?
Dad, can I go play, too? Can l?

150
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,740
如果你去玩那些海绵垫子我会感觉好一些
I would feel better if you'd play on the sponge beds.

151
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,290
我以前常去
That's where I would play.

152
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,360
-他的鳍是怎么了?  -他看起来很有趣
- What's wrong with his fin? - He looks funny.

153
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,760
喔!  嘿  我怎么了?
Ow! Hey, what'd I do?

154
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,760
不懂礼貌  这是他第一次来学校
Be nice. It's his first time at school.

155
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,490
他生来就有那个  我们叫它幸运鳍
He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin.

156
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,790
-老爸...  -看到这个触角了么?
- Dad... - See this tentacle?

157
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,960
事实上这个比我其他的触角短...
It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles...

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,130
但是你几乎看不出来
but you can't really tell.

159
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,600
尤其是我这样摆动的时候
Especially when I twirl them like this.

160
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,700
我对海水严重过敏
I'm H-2-O intolerant.

161
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,710
-啊-咻!  -我有过动症
- Ah-choo! - I'm obnoxious.

162
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,300
哦
Oh

163
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,180
让我们给这些地方起名字  这些地方  这些地方
Let's name the zones, the zones, the zones

164
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,380
让我们给广阔的海洋起名字
Let's name the zones of the open sea

165
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,610
雷老师来了!
Mr. Ray!

166
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,550
-来吧  尼莫  -你最好和我待在一起
- Come on, Nemo. - You better stay with me.

海洋中层  半深海  和深海区域
Mesopelagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic

168
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,930
其它的地方对于你我都太深了所以看不到
All the rest are too deep for you and me to see

169
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,290
哈  我想知道我的学生都哪去了?
Huh. I wonder where my class has gone?

170
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,060
我们在下面呢!
We're under here!

171
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,960
哦  你们在这
Oh, there you are.

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,560
上船了  探险家们
Climb aboard, explorers.

173
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,900
喔  充满知识的探险
Oh, knowledge exploring

174
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,430
喔  多么的愉快
is, oh, so lyrical

175
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,910
当你考虑你的想法的时候那是以经验为根据的
When you think thoughts that are empirical

176
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,100
老爸  你可以走了
Dad, you can go now.

177
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,240
-你好  这是谁?  -我是尼莫
- Hello. Who is this? - I'm Nemo.

178
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,940
尼莫  所有新来的探险者必须回答一个科学问题
Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.

179
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,780
-好的  -你住在一个什么样的房子里
- OK. - You live in what kind of home?

180
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,510
在海葵...葵

在海...海...葵...葵里
A nemenem-menome.

182

好了  闪了舌头就不好了  欢迎上船  探险家们
OK, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers.

183
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,590
就像你知道的那样  他的鳍很小
Just so you know, he's got a little fin.

184
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,290
游泳不方便...
I find if he's having trouble swimming...

185
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,300
游10到15分钟  我会让他休息一下
I let him take a break, 10, 15 minutes.

186
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,770
老爸  你该走了
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

187
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,860
不要担心  我们会像一个团队一样待在一起的
Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group.

188
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,300
好了  同学们  都向前看
OK, class, optical orbits up front.

189
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,790
还有要记住  上课时注意认真听讲  同学之间不准交头接耳
And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves.

190
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,810
我在说你呐  吉米
That means you, Jimmy.

191
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,930
噢  伙计!
Aw, man!

192
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,870
再见  尼莫!

注意安全
Be safe.

196
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,620
对第一次来说你已经做得很不错了
You're doing pretty well for a first-timer.

197
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,990
不能总守着他一辈子  是不是?
You can't hold on to them forever, can you?

198
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,260
不过他们经过峭壁的时候我总是不太放心
I had a tough time with my oldest out at the drop off.

199
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,560
他们的成长总是要经过...  峭壁?!
They got to grow up... The drop off?

200
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,470
他们要去峭壁?  你们是怎么了  精神不正常吗?
They're going to the drop off? What are you, insane?

201
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,800
我们为什么不现在就把他们来个油炸  然后切成小块端上去?
Why don't we fry them up now and serve them with chips?

202
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,100
嘿  玛蒂  冷静
Hey, Marty, calm down.

203
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,400
不要让我冷静  小马哥
Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy.

204
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,740
小马哥?
Pony boy?

205
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,640
对于一个小丑鱼来说  他的笑话很冷
For a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.

206
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,080
可惜
Pity.

207
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,980
哦
Oh

208

海草真有趣
Seaweed is fun

221
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,480
它自己做吃的
It makes its food

222
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,810
好了  峭壁到了
OK, the drop off.

223

来啊  尼莫  你能游多远?
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

249
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,960
我爸爸说那不安全
My dad says it's not safe.

250
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,920
-尼莫!  不!  -爸爸?
- Nemo! No! - Dad?

251
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,390
你要游到海面了
You were about to swim into open water.

252

不  我没有...
No, I wasn't...

253
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,530
多亏我在这里  如果我没出现...
Good thing I was here. lf I hadn't shown up...

254

不  我不怕
No, I wasn't.

256
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,630
这和你们没关系  孩子们...
This does not concern you, kids...

257
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,030
你们很幸运我不会告诉你们的家长
and you're lucky I don't tell your parents.

258
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,370
你知道你游泳技术还不行
You know you can't swim well.

259
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,340
我游得很好  老爸  行吗?
I can swim fine, Dad, OK?

260
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,280
不  那不好  你不应该靠近这里
No, it's not OK. You shouldn't be near here.

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,710
好了  我是对的  你还是过一两年再上学吧
OK, I was right. You'll start school in a year or two.

262
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,480
不  老爸!  只是因为你害怕大海...
No, Dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean...

263
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,370
已经很清楚了  你还没有准备好...
Clearly, you're not ready...

264
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,880
在你没准备好之前你要到这里来
and you're not coming back until you are.

265
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,180
你认为你可以做这些事...
You think you can do these things...

266
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,120
但是你还做不到  尼莫!
but you just can't, Nemo!

267
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,050
我恨你
I hate you.

268
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,890
那是
There's

269
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,760
没什么好看的  到这来  去那边
Nothing to see. Gather. Over there.

270
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,060
对不起  我可以帮你吗?
Excuse me. Is there anything I can do?

271
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,160
先生  我是他们的科学老师  出什么事了吗?
I am a scientist, sir. Is there any problem?

272
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,290
对不起  我不是故意要打断你
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things.

273
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,170
他游泳技术还不行  在没有允许的情况下就到那去
He isn't a good swimmer, and it's a little too soon...

274
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,930
我想对他来说还有点为时过早
for him to be out here unsupervised.

275
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,740
我向你保证  他和我在一起会很安全
I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.

276
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,740
我相信他会的  但是你有这么多学生...
I'm sure he is, but you have a large class...

277
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,610
他可能在你没有注意到的情况下  就会脱离你的视线的
and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking.

278
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,590
我不是说你没有注意
I'm not saying you're not looking.

279
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,820
噢  糟了!  尼莫正在游向海面!
Oh, my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!

280
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,880
尼莫!
Nemo!

281
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,990
你知道你在干什么吗?
What do you think you're doing?

282
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,820
你会被卡住的...
You'll get stuck out there...

283
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,350
我会在另一条鱼那么做之前把你抓住的
and I'll have to get you before another fish does.

284
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,300
快回来!
Get back here!

285
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,330
我说你现在回来!
I said get back here now!

286
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,200
停下!  你再敢往前游一下...
Stop! You take one more move, mister...

287
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,110
你敢!
Don't you dare!

288
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,200
如果你敢把一只鳍放放在那船上...
lf you put one fin on that boat...

289
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,740
你在听我说吗?
Are you listening to me?

290
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,410
不要碰那个船...尼莫!
Don't touch the bo... Nemo!

291
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,080
他碰了那个大屁股了
He touched the butt.

292
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,850
你赶快用你的小尾巴给我游回来  尼莫
You paddle your little tail right back here, Nemo.

293
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,050
这就对了
That's right.

294
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,780
你有大麻烦了  年轻人
You are in big trouble, young man.

295
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,620
你听见我说的了么  大...
Do you hear me? Big...

296
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,400
大...
Big...

297
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,690
老爸!  救我!
Daddy! Help me!

298
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,700
我来了  尼莫!
I'm coming, Nemo!

299
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,940
藏到我下面来  孩子们!
Get under me, kids!

300
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,370
噢!  不!
Oh! No!

301
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,100
老爸!
Dad!

302
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,540
老爸!
Daddy!

303
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,650
噢!  尼莫!
Oh! Nemo!

304
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,080
啊  尼莫!
Unh. Nemo!

305
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,750
尼莫  不!  尼莫!
Nemo, no! Nemo!

306
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,760
尼莫!  尼莫!  不!
Nemo! Nemo! No!

307
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,160
不!
No!

308
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,600
尼莫!  尼莫!
Nemo! Nemo!

309
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,120
哇!  坚持住
Whoa! Hold on.

310
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,130
噢  不
Oh, no.

311
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,770
不  不  不见了  不见了
No. No, it's gone. It's gone.

312
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,100
不  不  怎么会不见了
No, no, it can't be gone.

313
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,470
不!  不!  尼莫!
No, no! Nemo!

314
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,110
尼莫!  尼莫!
Nemo! Nemo!

315
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,700
尼莫!  尼莫!
Nemo! Nemo!

316
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,980
不!
No!

317
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,680
尼莫!  尼莫!
Nemo! Nemo!

318
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,520
不!  不  求你了  不!
No! No, please, no!

319
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,520
不  不!
No, no!

320
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,450
有人看到一艘船了吗?
Has anybody seen a boat?

321
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,330
求你们了!  一艘白色的船!
Please! A white boat!

322
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,030
他们带走了我的儿子!
They took my son!

323
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,570
我的儿子!  帮帮我  求你们了
My son! Help me, please.

324
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,470
-小心!  -什么?
- Look out! - What?

325
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,900
噢  哦
Ooh. Ohh.

326
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,540
噢  噢  噢  对不起  我没有看到你
Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry. I didn't see you.

327
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,880
-先生?  你还好吗?  -他不见了  他不见了
- Sir? Are you OK? - He's gone, he's gone.

328
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,350
好  好  没事了
There, there. It's all right.

329
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,640
-他不见了  -没事的
- He's gone. - It'll be OK.

330
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,240
不  不  他们把他带走了  我必须要找到那艘船
No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.

331
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,350
船?  嘿  我看到了一艘船
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.

332
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,690
-你看到了?  -刚刚过去不久
- You have? - It passed by not too long ago.

333
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,090
-白色的?  -嘿  我叫多莉
- A white one? - Hi. I'm Dory.

334
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,320
在哪?  哪个方向?
Where? Which way?

335
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,520
噢  噢  噢  往那边去了
Oh, oh, oh. It went this way.

336
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,960
往那边去了  跟我来
It went this way. Follow me.

337
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,370
谢谢你  谢谢你  真是太谢谢你了
Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much.

338
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,530
没关系
No problem.

339
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,120
嘿...
Hey...

340
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,560
等等!
Wait!

341
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,760
-你能不能别老跟着我?  -什么?
- Will you quit it? - What?

342
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,570
我想在这里游一会  海里这么大不够你游的吗?
I'm trying to swim here. Ocean isn't big enough for you?

343
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,520
你有麻烦了  伙计?  啊?  啊?
You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh?

344
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,540
是不是?  是不是?  你想要我?
Do you? Do you? You want a piece of me?

345
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,450
噢  我好害怕啊  那又怎么样?
Ooh, I'm scared now. What?

346
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,080
-等一下  -不要再跟着我  好吗?
- Wait a minute. - Stop following me, OK?

347
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,250
什么?  你在带我去找那艘船
What? You're showing me where the boat went.

348
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,890
船?  嘿  我看到了一艘船
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.

349
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,320
它才经过没多久  它朝那边去了
It passed by not too long ago. It went this way.

350
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,760
它朝那边去了  跟我来
It went this way. Follow me.

351
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,920
等一下  出什么事了?
Wait a minute. What is going on?

352
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,260
你已经告诉我船向什么方向去了
You already told me which way the boat was going.

353
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,500
我说过了么?  噢  不
I did? Oh, no.

354
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,830
如果这是什么玩笑的话  这并不好笑
lf this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny.

355
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,170
我是只小丑鱼  别想在我面前班门弄斧
And I know funny. I'm a clownfish.

356
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,610
不  不是的  我知道那不是玩笑  对不起
No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry.

357
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,610
看  我有短期失忆症
See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.

358
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,480
短期失忆症  我不信这个
Short-term memory loss. I don't believe this.

359
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,380
不  是真的  我几乎马上就会忘掉发生的事情
No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly.

360
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,380
是家庭遗传  至少  我是这么认为的
It runs in my family. At least, I think it does.

361
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,450
嗯  嗯  我家里人呢?
Um, hmm. Where are they?

362
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,630
要我帮忙吗?
Can I help you?

363
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,300
你确实有毛病...真的
Something's wrong with you... really.

364
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,200
你误了我的大事
You're wasting my time.

365
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,300
我必须要找到我的儿子
I have to find my son.

366
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,100
你好
Hello.

367
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,140
-噢  -那个  嗨!
- Ohh. - Well, hi!

368
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,210
我叫  布鲁斯
Name's Bruce.

369
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,010
没关系  我理解
It's all right. I understand.

370
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,780
为什么要相信一个鲨鱼  对不对?
Why trust a shark, right?

371
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,960
那么  这么晚了
So, what's a couple of bites like you...

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,660
你们两个还出来做什么  嗯?
doing out so late, eh?

373
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,730
我们没干什么  我们甚至没出去
We're not doing anything. We're not even out.

374
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,000
太好了!  那么你们两个是否愿意
Great! Then how'd you morsels...

375
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,300
参加我举行的一个小型的集会呢?
like to come to a little get-together I'm having?

376
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,540
你的意思是?  是派对吧?
You mean, like a party?

377
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,640
是的  很对  是派对  你怎么说?
Yeah, right. A party. What do you say?

378
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,840
我喜欢派对  那听起来很有意思
I love parties. That sounds like fun.

379
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,280
派对很有趣  还很有诱惑力  但是...
Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but...

380
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,220
噢  来吧  我坚持要求你们参加
Oh, come on, I insist.

381
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,450
好吧  既然那么重要
OK. That's all that matters.

382
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,260
嘿  看  气球  真是个派对
Hey, look, balloons. It is a party.

383
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,630
哈哈哈哈!  请不要靠近
Ha ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though.

384
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,330
那可不是闹着玩的
Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.

385
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,670
要是弄响了  麻烦可就大了
You wouldn't want one of them to pop.

386
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,250
安安!  小沈!
Anchor! Chum!

387
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,090
你回来了  布鲁斯  终于回来了
There you are, Bruce. Finally.

388
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,790
-有客人来了  -真不是时候  伙计
- We got company. - It's about time, mate.

389
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,690
我们已经吃过饭了...
We've already gone through the snacks...

390
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,290
我们已经吃过饭了...
We've already gone through the snacks...

391
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,890
但是我还是饿
and I'm still starving.

392
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,130
我几乎饿得要发疯了
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

393
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,890
来吧  让我们来解决他
Come on, let's get this over with.

394
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,730
好了  那么
Right, then.

395
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,070
会议正式开始
The meeting has officially come to order.

396
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,600
让我们来宣读誓言
Let us all say the pledge.

397
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,130
我是一只好鲨鱼  不是一只没有头脑只会吃的机器
I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine.

398
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,810
如果我要改变这个形象...
lf I am to change this image...

399
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,280
我必须要从改变自我开始
I must first change myself.

400
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,050
鱼类是朋友  不是食物
Fish are friends, not food.

401
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,420
除了那些臭海豚
Except stinkin' dolphins.

402
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,480
海豚  耶  他们自以为他们很可爱
Dolphins. Yeah. They think they're so cute.

403
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,250
看我  我是一只会跳的小海豚
"Look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin.

404
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,950
我跳一个给你看吧  我不像吗?
"Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?"

405
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,590
那么  接着  今天的会议到了第五个议程...
Right, then. Today's meeting is Step 5...

406
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,290
带一个鱼朋友来
Bring a Fish Friend.

407
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,820
你们都把朋友带来了吗?
Do you all have your friends?

408
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,030
我的到了
Got mine.

409
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,030
-嘿  你好  -你的呢  小沈?
- Hey, there. - How about you, Chum?

410
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,600
噢  我...可能把我的朋友放错地方了
Oh, l... seem to have misplaced my friend.

411
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,580
那没什么  小沈
That's all right, Chum.

412
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,140
我有个感觉  和鱼类做朋友确实很艰难
I had a feeling this would be a difficult step.

413
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,710
我先借你一个朋友吧
You can help yourself to one of my friends.

414
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,210
谢谢了  伙计  给小沈一个小朋友  嗯?
Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?

415
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,910
我先来开始陈述
I'll start the testimonies.

416
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,180
你们好  我的名字叫布鲁斯
Hello. My name is Bruce.

417
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,490
你好  布鲁斯
Hello, Bruce.

418
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,690
从我最后吃鱼是三周前的事了
It has been three weeks since my last fish.

419
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,160
我会履行承诺  否则割我的鱼翅做粥
On my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup.

420
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,960
-你给了我们莫大的鼓舞  -阿门
- You're an inspiration! - Amen.

421
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,630
好了  然后  谁是下一个?
Right, then. Who's next?

422
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,970
我  我
Pick me, pick me.

423
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,870
好的  前排那位女士
Yes. The little Sheila down the front.

424
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,960
-喔!  -到这上面来
- Whoo! - Come on up here.

425
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,810
嗨  我叫多莉
Hi. I'm Dory.

426
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,240
-你好  多莉  -然后  啊  那个...
- Hello, Dory. - And, uh, well...

427
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,440
我不认为我曾经吃过鱼
I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.

428
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,040
-那真是奇迹  -你太好了  伙计
- That's incredible. - Good on you, mate.

429
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,110
我很高兴我心里的石头终于落地了
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

430
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,490
好的  还有没有人?
All right, anyone else?

431
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,120
你怎么样  伙计?  你有什么问题?
How about you, mate? What's your problem?

432
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,390
我?  我没问题
Me? I don't have a problem.

433
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,790
噢  好的
Oh, OK.

434
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,420
否决
Denial.

435
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,300
从你的名字开始说
Just start with your name.

436
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,030
好吧  啊  你们好
OK. Uh, hello.

437
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,160
我叫马林  我是一只小丑鱼
My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish.

438
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,230
-小丑鱼?  真的吗?  -给我们讲个笑话
- A clownfish? Really? - Tell us a joke.

439
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,000
我喜欢笑话
I love jokes.

440
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,040
我只会讲一个很冷的笑话  还算不错的
I actually do know one that's pretty good.

441
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,110
有一个软体动物...
There was this mollusk...

442
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,480
他走着去找一个海参
and he walks up to a sea cucumber.

443
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,350
通常  他们都不说话  海参...
Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers...

444
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,350
但是在笑话里  每个人都说话...
but in a joke, everyone talks...

445
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,450
所以这个软体动物对那个海参说...
so the sea mollusk says to the cucumber...

446
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,750
老爸!
Daddy!

447
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,130
尼莫!
Nemo!

448
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,190
尼莫!  哈哈!  尼莫!  我没听明白
Nemo! Ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it.

449
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,130
作为一个小丑鱼  他真的很冷
For a clownfish, he's not that funny.

450
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,000
不  不  不  不  他是我的儿子
No, no, no, no. He's my son.

451
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,100
他被一个潜水员带走了
He was taken by these divers.

452
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,840
噢  我的天  你这只可怜的鱼
Oh, my. You poor fish.

453
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,840
人类...以为他们拥有所有的一切
Humans... think they own everything.

454
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,140
或许是美国人
Probably American.

455
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,180
现在  有一位父亲...  在寻找他的小孩
Now, there is a father... Looking for his little boy.

456
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,310
现在  有一位父亲...  在寻找他的小孩
Now, there is a father... Looking for his little boy.

457
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,840
这些记号是什么意思?
What do these markings mean?

458
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,220
我甚至不认识我的父亲!
I never knew my father!

459
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,650
-拥抱一下  -我们都在这陪着你呢  伙计
- Group hug. - We're all mates here, mate.

460
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,920
我看不懂人类的东西
I can't read human.

461
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,220
我们要找一个能看明白这个的鱼
We got to find a fish that can read this.

462
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,230
-嘿  看看  鲨鱼们  -不  不  不  多莉!
- Hey, look, sharks. - No, no, no, Dory!

That's mine. Give it to me.

465
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,270
给我!  噢!
Gimme! Ow!

466
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,270
噢  对不起  你没事吧?
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you OK?

467
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,700
-噢  噢  噢  -很对不起
- Ow, ow, ow. - I'm so sorry.

468
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,860
你真的打到我耳朵了  你喜欢看到流血吗?
You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?

469
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,810
-喔  -噢  噢  噢
- Ohh. - Ow, ow, ow.

470
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,400

471
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,980
喔  味道好极了
Ohh, that's good.

472
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,910
马上阻止!
Intervention!

473
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,540
-只要咬一口  -一起抓住他  伙计!
- Just a bite. - Hold it together, mate!

474
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,010
记住  布鲁斯  鱼是朋友  不是食物!
Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!

475
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,360
-食物!  -多莉  小心!
- Food! - Dory, look out!

476
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,150
-食物!  -多莉  小心!
- Food! - Dory, look out!

477
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,750
我今天晚上有鱼吃了!
I'm having fish tonight!

478
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,390
要记住守则  伙计!

479
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,470
只要一小口!

480
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,310
真是个好日子
G'day.

481
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,610
没有出路了!
There's no way out!

482
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,410
一定会有逃出去的路的!
There's got to be a way to escape!

483
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,950
是谁呀?
Who is it?

484
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,320
多莉  帮我找个出去的路!
Dory, help me find a way out!

485
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,880
谁啊?  对不起  改天再来吧  我们逃命要紧呢
Sorry. Come back later. We're trying to escape.

486
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,490
-应该有逃出去的路的!  -这有个东西
- There's got to be a way out! - Here's something.

487
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,260
"逃生舱"  我想知道那个是什么意思
"Es-cap-e." I wonder what that means.

488
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,820
真有趣  它跟"逃生"难道不是一个意思吗?
Funny. It's spelled just like "escape."

489
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,130
我们走
Let's go.

490
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,260
布鲁斯来了!
Here's Brucey!

491
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,000
等一下  你认识字吗?
Wait a minute. You can read?

492
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,030
我认识字吗?  对啊  我认识!
I can read? That's right. I can read!

493
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,200
那么  这个  给我念一念这个
Well, then, here. Read this now.

494
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,010
他真的不是故意要这么做的  因为他想念父亲才变成这样
He really doesn't mean it. He never even knew his father.

495
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,280
不要从车上掉下去!
Don't fall off the wagon!

497
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,320
不  布鲁斯  你要坚强
No, Bruce, focus.

498
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,490
关于布鲁斯的事很对不起  伙计
Sorry about Bruce, mate.

499
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,190
他真的是一个好人
He's really a nice guy.

500
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,460
我需要那个面罩
I need to get that mask.

501
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,090
你要那个面罩?  好的

505
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,840
怎么了?
What?

506
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,420
快逃命吧!
Swim away! Swim away!

507
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,180
喔  聚会结束了吗?
Aw, is the party over?

508
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,470
你厉害
Nice.

509
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,720
老爸?
Dad?

510
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,760
老爸?
Daddy?

511
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,560
-芭芭拉  -啊哈?
- Barbara. - Uh-huh?

512
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,420
请准备一下他的前牙牙冠好吗?
Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please?

513
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,890
我还需要一些棉花球
And I'm going to need a few more cotton rolls.

514
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,560
好的
OK.

515
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,030

Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he?

517
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,740
我在暗礁那里发现了这个小家伙
I found that guy struggling for life...

518
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,550
他正在拼命挣扎  于是我救了他
out on the reef, and I saved him.

519
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,700
那么  麻醉剂已经生效了吗?
So, has that Novocaine kicked in yet?

520
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,940
我认为是的  我们可以开始了
I think so. We're ready to roll.

521
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,700

你们知道我爸爸在哪吗?
Do you know where my dad is?

529
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,410
亲爱的  你爸爸可能已经回宠物店了

-是这样  -啊哈?
- Here's the thing. - Uh-huh.

796
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,950
我认为最好我能继续...
I think it's best if I carry on from here by...

797
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,360
一个人走的好
by myself.

798
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,590
好的
OK.

799
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,330
-你知道  一个人  -啊哈
- You know, alone. - Uh-huh.

800
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,390
没有...没有...  我是说  不想再和你一起
Without... without... I mean, not without you.

801
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,800
但是我不想你...跟着我
But I don't want you... with me.

802
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,170
-啊?  -我...
- Huh? - Am l...

803
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,370
我不想伤害你的感情
I don't want to hurt your feelings.

804
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,210
-你要我走?  -我的意思是  不...是的
- You want me to leave? - I mean, not... Yes.

805
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,680
我只是不能再有任何的耽搁了...
I just can't afford any more delays...

806
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,910
而你是那种能让人耽搁的鱼
and you're one of those fish that cause delays.

807
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,580
有的时候那是件好事
Sometimes it's a good thing.

808
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,650
有一大群鱼  他们都是那种拖拖拉拉的鱼
There's a whole group of fish. They're delay fish.

809
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,250
你的意思是...
You mean...

810
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,950
你的意思是你不喜欢我?
You mean you don't like me?

811
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,790
不  当然我喜欢你
No, of course I like you.

812
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,520
那是因为我喜欢你所以我才不想你和我一起走
It's because I like you I don't want to be with you.

813
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,730
那是种复杂的感情
It's a complicated emotion.

814
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:30,460
-噢!  -不要哭  我喜欢你
- Ohh! - Don't cry. I like you.

815
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,870
嘿  你!  女士  这个家伙找你的麻烦吗?
Hey, you! Lady, is this guy bothering you?

816
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,840
嗯...我不记得了  你做过么?
Um... I don't remember. Were you?

817
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,780
不  不  不  不  不  我们只是...
No, no, no, no, no. We're just...

818
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,580
你们知道我怎么才能到...
Do you guys know how I can get to...

819
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,950
看  伙计  我们在和女士说话  不是跟你说
Look, pal, we're talking to the lady, not you.

820
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,580
嘿  嘿  你喜欢模仿秀么?
Hey, hey. You like impressions?

821
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,020
要像预演的时候一样  先生们
Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.

822
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,610
那么我们是什么?  猜一下
So what are we? Take a guess.

823
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,950
哦  哦  我曾经见过一个
Oh, oh. I've seen one of those.

824
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,190
我是条长着利剑般鼻子的鱼
I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

825
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,200
-等等  -是剑鱼!
- Wait, wait, um... - It's a swordfish!

826
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,000
嘿  小丑鱼  让那女士猜
Hey, clown boy, let the lady guess.

827
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,260
嘿  小丑鱼  让那女士猜
Hey, clown boy, let the lady guess.

828
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,860
先生们  谁需要奶油?
Where's the butter?

829
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,300
啊!  就在嘴边!
Ooh! It's on the tip of my tongue!

830
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,330
-龙虾  -看这儿!
- Lobster. - Saw that!

831
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,200
有很多爪  并且生活在海里
Lots of legs! Live in the ocean.

832
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,640
-安静!  -时间到!
- Clam! - Close enough!

833
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,160
一个关于鲸鱼的传说
Oh, it's a whale of a tale

834
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,680
我会跟你讲的  嗯...
I'll tell you, lad...

835
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,700
不错
They're good.

836
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,040
有人愿意为我指一下路吗?!
Will somebody please give me directions?!

837
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,450
"有人愿意为我指一下路吗?!"
"Will somebody please give me directions?!"

838
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,510
-哈哈!  -我是认真的!
- Ha ha ha ha ha! - I'm serious!

839
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,540
呐呐呐  呢呢呐
"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!

840
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,780
呐呐呐呐  呢呢呢
"Blah blah blah, me, me, me!"

841
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,310
谢谢
Thank you.

842
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,850
啊  亲爱的  嘿!  嘿  回来!
Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back!

843
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,030
-嘿  什么事?  -什么事?
- Hey, what's the matter? - What's the matter?

844
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:27,550
-嘿  什么事?  -什么事?
- Hey, what's the matter? - What's the matter?

845
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,560
当他们在做着那些愚蠢的模仿秀时...
While they're doing their silly little impressions...

846
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,730
我正远离家乡  守着一条我连名字都记不起的傻鱼!
I am miles from home with a fish that can't remember her name!

847
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,060
我想这真是令人沮丧
I bet that's frustrating.

848
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,540
而且  我儿子还下落不明
Meanwhile, my son is out there.

849
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,560
-你的儿子吉莫?  -是尼莫?
- Your son Chico? - Nemo?

850
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,000
但也只能这样了  因为整个大海里...
But it doesn't matter because no fish...

851
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,010
都没有一条鱼肯帮我
in this entire ocean is going to help me.

852
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,810
嗯  我会帮你
Well, I'm helping you.

853
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,180
在这儿等着
Wait right here.

854
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,010
-嗨!  伙计们  -他又在烦你吗?
- Guys! - Is he bothering you again?

855
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,290
没有  他是好人
No, no. He's a good guy.

856
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,850
对他好点  他的儿子法比欧走失了
Go easy on him. He's lost his son Fabio.

857
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,760
你听说过悉尼袋鼠路42号  P.歇尔曼吗?
Any of you heard of P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

858
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,490
悉尼?  啊  当然!
Sydney? Oh, sure!

859
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,260
这儿的特克在悉尼有亲戚
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney.

860
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,920
-不是吗  特克?  -当然有!
- Don't you, Ted? - Sure do!

861
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,450
啊!  嘿!  他们知道悉尼!
Oh! Hey! They know Sydney!

862
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,190
你不知道去那里的路  是吧?
You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?

863
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,200
我会跟着东流一直走
You want to follow the E.A.C.

864
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,930
就是东澳洲暖流
That's the East Australian Current.

865
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,600
很大的洋流  不会找不到的
Big current. Can't miss it.

866
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,610
它现在是...朝那方向流的
It's in... that direction.

867
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,540
你跟着洋流走大约...
And then you follow that for about...

868
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,340
我不知道  你们认为呢?
I don't know. What do you guys think?

869
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,540
大约十海里吧?
About three leagues?

870
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,550
它正好能把你们带到悉尼的
That little baby will put you right past Sydney.

871
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,020
太好了!
That's great!

872
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,250
多莉  谢谢!
Dory, you did it!

873
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,120
啊  别这样  我是你的小助手
Oh, please, I'm just your little helper.

874
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,490
-一路帮忙  就是我  -伙计们  谢谢
- Helping along. That's me. - Fellas, thank you.

875
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:37,160
别客气!  放轻松  好吗  伙计?
Don't mention it! Just loosen up, OK, buddy?

876
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,190
啊  你们这些伙计  你们说到点子上了  再见
Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye.

877
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,060
啊  嘿  女士  还有一件事
Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing.

878
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,660
当你遇到这条海沟时  从下面游过去  别从上面过去
When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.

879
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,610
海沟...从下面过  别从上面过
Trench... through it, not over it.

880
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,340
我记住了  嘿  嘿!
I'll remember. Hey, hey!

881
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,040
嘿  等等  伙伴!  等等!
Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on!

882
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,810
等等!  我有话要说
Wait, wait, wait! I gotta tell you something.

883
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,550
哇
Whoa.

884
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,880
好漂亮的海沟
Nice trench.

885
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,620
你好!
Hello!

886
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:11,960
-好  出发  -不  不  我看这海沟有点玄
- OK, let's go. - No, no. Bad trench.

887
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,660
快点  我们还是从上面游过这东西
Come on, we'll swim over this thing.

888
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,830
嗨  搭档  上面肯定不行
Whoa, partner. Little red flag going up.

889
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:19,500
我记得好像有谁说过  只能走下面不能走上面
Something's telling me to swim through it, not over it.

890
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,170
嘿  我说你没有长眼睛吗?
Are you looking at this thing?

891
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,700
要是从下面过  那你就死定了
It's got death written all over it.

892
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,580
我真的  真的  真的  认为我们应该从下面穿过去
I really, really, really think we should swim through.

893
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,840
而我真的  真的认为不应该走下面  从上面过吧
And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go.

894
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,850
-相信我  -相信你?
- Trust me on this. - Trust you?

895
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,750
是的  信任  朋友之间就该这样
Yes, trust. It's what friends do.

896
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,690
瞧!  有东西在发光!
Look! Something shiny!

897
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,480
-哪儿?  -就在下面
- Where? - It just swam over the trench.

898
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,230
-快点  我们跟上来!  -好吧!
- Come on, we'll follow it! - OK!

899
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,890
天呐  这什么都没有
Boy, it sure is clear up here.

900
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:47,390
没错  瞧...  是洋流
Exactly. And look at that... there's the current.

901
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:50,030
我们一分钟也不能耽搁了
We should be there in no time.

902
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,870
嘿  小家伙
Hey, little guy.

903
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,670
你当时还说什么从下面游过那个海沟
You wanted to go through the trench.

904
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,730
我应该叫他柔柔  他是我的
I shall call him Squishy, and he shall be mine.

905
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,940
他将是我的小宝贝  过来  小柔柔
And he shall be my Squishy. Come here, Squishy.

906
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,480
过来  小柔柔
Come here, little Squishy.

907
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,460
-那是水母!  -你是个坏柔柔!
- That's a jellyfish! - Bad Squishy!

908
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,250
嘘  嘘!  快走开!
Shoo, shoo! Get away!

909
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,590
-让我瞧瞧  -别碰它
- Let me see that. - Don't touch it.

910
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,960
我不会碰它的  我只是想瞧瞧
I won't touch it. I just want to look.

911
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,020
嘿!  它怎么不刺你啊?
Hey! How come it didn't sting you?

912
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,580
刺了  只不过...
It did. It's just that...

913
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,320
别动
Hold still.

914
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,830
我生活在海葵区...
I live in this anemone...

915
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,730
经常被刺  已经习惯了
and I'm used to these kind of stings.

916
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,840
看上去还不太糟  你会好的
It doesn't look bad. You'll be fine.

917
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,730
但现在我们应该学乖一点了  我们...
But now we know, don't we...

918
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,970
我们不要再碰这些东西了
that we don't want to touch these again.

919
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:31,030
我们很幸运  这次只是个小家伙
Let's be thankful this time it was just a little one.

920
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,780
别动
Don't move.

921
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,870
-这下可坏了  多莉  -嘿  瞧!
- This is bad, Dory. - Hey, watch this!

922
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,480
多莉!
Dory!

923
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,850
你碰不到我
You can't catch me

924
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:46,360
别在上面跳!
Don't bounce on the tops!

925
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,520
它不...刺你?!
They will... not sting you!

926
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,230
-上面是不会刺你的!  -一次跳两个呀!  打呀!
- The tops don't sting you! - Two in a row! Beat that!

927
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:55,200
多莉  听我说  我有个主意...来玩一个游戏
Dory, listen to me. I have an idea... a game.

928
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,700
-一个游戏?  -是的
- A game? - Yes.

929
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,470
-我喜欢游戏!  我参加!  -游戏是这样的
- I love games! Pick me! - Here's the game.

930
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:02,960
谁最快跳离这些水母  谁就赢!
Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish wins!

931
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,640
-好  -规则是  规则是  规则是!
- OK. - Rules, rules, rules!

932
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,240
你不得碰这些触角  只能碰上面
You can't touch the tentacles. Only the tops.

933
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,150
不碰就不碰  知道了  出发!
Something about tentacles. Got it. Go!

934
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,120
等等!  千万不能碰!
Wait! Not something about 'em, it's all about 'em!

935
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:13,350
等等  多莉!
Wait, Dory!

936
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,140
如果想赢  你得再快点!
Gotta go faster if you want to win!

937
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,680
哇!  多莉!
Whoa! Dory!

938
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:21,590
等等!  多莉!
Wait a minute! Whoa! Dory!

939
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,460
这简直是在玩命啊  我们是在和死神赛跑
We're cheating death now. That's what we're doing.

940
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,160
但我们却乐在其中
But we're having fun at the same time.

941
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,630
我行的  但要小心
I can do this. Just be careful.

942
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:31,570
是的  小心  我赢了你别哭!
Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!

943
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,770
哭的是你!
I don't think so!

944
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:36,170
哇!
Whoa!

945
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,370
放弃吧  老家伙
Give it up, old man.

946
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,670
我天生就是小飞侠
You can't fight evolution. I was built for speed.

947
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,680
问题是  多莉  你饿吗?
The question is, Dory, are you hungry?

948
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,050
-饿?  -是的
- Hungry? - Yeah.

949
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,810
你要是饿就吃我的泡泡吧!
'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles!

950
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,010
向左下潜!  就这里!
Duck to the left! Right there!

951
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,820
小丑鱼赢了!
The clownfish is the winner!

952
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,920
我们成功了!  瞧我们!
Whoo-hoo! We did it! Look at us!

953
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,490
多莉?
Dory?

954
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,120
啊  不
Oh, no.

955
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,490
多莉!  多莉!
Dory! Dory!

956
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,620
多莉!
Dory!

957
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,830
多莉!
Dory!

958
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,740
我输了吗?
Am I disqualified?

959
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,740
不  你干得很好!  实际上你赢了!
No, you're doing fine! You're actually winning!

960
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,910
但你得保持清醒  P.歇尔曼住在哪里?
But you gotta stay awake. Where does P. Sherman live?

961
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,850
P.歇尔曼...  悉尼  袋鼠路...
P. Sherman... Wallaby Way, Sydney...

962
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,650
对了!
That's it!

963
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,580
-袋鼠路...  -保持清醒!
- Wallaby Way... - Uhh! Stay awake!

964
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,920
保持清醒!  啊!  保持清醒!
Stay awake! Ooh! Stay awake!

965
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,720
保持...清醒!

966
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,530
-醒醒  -P.歇尔曼

醒醒  尼莫...
Wake up. Nemo...

969
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,660
鲨鱼饵  想你老爸了  是吗?
You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait?

970
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:08,560
是的
Yeah.

971
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,050
是的
Yeah.

972
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:13,090
你可真幸运  外面有人在找你
You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you.

973
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,290
他不会找我的
He's not looking for me.

974
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:18,700
他害怕大海
He's scared of the ocean.

975
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,290
桃桃  有什么情况?
Peach, any movement?

976
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:23,270
他已经喝了至少四杯咖啡了  我看快了
He's had four cups of coffee. It's gotta be soon.

977
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,830
继续监视住他
Keep on him.

978
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,080
我第一次逃跑...  结果掉到了牙钻上
My first escape... landed on dental tools.

979
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,550
我本来想跳到马桶的
I was aiming for the toilet.

980
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,780
马桶?
Toilet?

981
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,410
条条水管通大海  孩子
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

982
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:38,720
你曾试图逃跑了多少次?
Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?

983
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,350
我已经记不清了
Ah, I've lost count.

984
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,330
鱼类不应该养在鱼缸里
Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid.

985
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,020
久了头脑会有问题
It does things to you.

986
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,190
泡泡!
Bubbles! Bubbles!

987
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,600
洗手间!  洗手间!  他拿起了读者文摘
Potty break! He grabbed the "Reader's Digest."

988
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,030
-我们有4分20秒!  -看你的了  鲨鱼饵
- We have 4.2 minutes! - That's your cue, Sharkbait.

989
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:54,180
-你能行的  孩子  -我们得快点
- You can do it, kid. - We gotta be quick.

990
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,040
一旦你进去  一直游到底...
Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the chamber...

991
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,840
剩下的听我的命令
and I'll talk you through the rest.

992
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,670
-好  -去吧  你没问题的
- OK. - It'll be a piece of kelp.

993
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,490
干得漂亮!
Nicely done!

994
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,250
-你听到我的话了吗?  -是的!
- Can you hear me? - Yeah!

995
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:15,780
鹅卵石来了
Here comes the pebble.

996
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:23,530
现在  你看到了一个小孔了吗?
Now, do you see a small opening?

997
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,200
进去  你会看到一个转动的风扇
Inside it, you'll see a rotating fan.

998
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,770
把这个鹅卵石塞进风扇  使它停转
Wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning.

999
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,810
-小心  鲨鱼饵!  -我不行!
- Careful, Sharkbait! - I can't do it!

1000
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,380
吉哥  这个主意不好
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

1001
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,180
他行的  再试试!
He'll be fine. Try again!

1002
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,920
好
OK.

1003
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,430
就是这样  鲨鱼饵
That's it, Sharkbait.

1004
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,760
又准又稳
Nice and steady.

1005
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,790
我成功了!  我成功了!
I got it! I got it!

1006
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:57,560
-他成功了!  -太好了  孩子!
- He did it! - That's great, kid!

1007
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,800
现在顺着水管游上  就出去了
Now swim up the tube and out.

1008
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:19,820
啊  不!  吉哥!
Oh, no! Gill!

1009
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,050
-鲨鱼饵!  -啊  糟了!

把他弄出来!
Get him outta there!

1011
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,890
-我们该怎么办?  -啊  不!
- What do we do? - Oh, no!

1012
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,900
冷静  孩子  千万别慌张!
Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic!

1013
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,330
救我!
Help me!

1014
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,730
鲨鱼饵  咬住这个!
Sharkbait, grab hold of this!

1015
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,210
-不!  不!  不!  -再多伸进去一些!
- No! No! No! - Feed me more!

1016
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,180
-就只能伸进去这么长了!  -鲨鱼饵!  咬住!
- That's it! - Sharkbait! Grab it!

1017
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,910

用力拉!
Pull!

1019
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,120
吉哥  别让他再去了
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

1020
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,390
好的  我不会再让他去了
No. We're done.

1021

1060
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,200
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1061
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:26,570
那都是我的错  是我的错
This is all my fault. It's my fault.

1062
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:31,570
29  30!  准备好了  我来了!
Twenty-nine, thirty! Ready or not, here I come!

1063
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:33,600
你在哪儿啊?!
There you are!

1064
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,150
多莉?
Dory?

1065
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,010
漂亮的水波!
Nice wave!

1066
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,200
送你上去!
Up you go!

1067
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,290
-啊  我的老天!  -没关系  伙计
- Oh, my goodness! - Kill the motor, dude.

1068
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,670
我们来看看小古的个人单飞表演
Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.

1069
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,140
哇!  这真酷!
Whoa! That was so cool!

1070
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,980
嘿  老爸  你看到了吗?
Hey, Dad, did you see that?

1071
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,350
你看到我了吗?  你看我我刚才做的事了吗?
Did you see me? Did you see what I did?

1072
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,360
你真棒  儿子!
You so totally rock, Squirt!

1073
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:23,920
来我们来击掌
So give me some fin.

1074
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,360
碰头
Noggin.

1075
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,760
-朋友  -朋友
- Dude. - Dude.

1076
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,190
啊...介绍一下
Oh... intro.

1077
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,130
水母游侠  这是我儿子
Jellyman, offspring.

1078
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:32,220
我儿子小古  水母游侠
Offspring, Jellyman.

1079
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,790
-水母游侠?!  厉害  -那当然
- Jellies?! Sweet. - Totally.

1080
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,070
那不算什么  承蒙各位夸奖
Apparently, I must've done something you liked... dudes.

1081
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,540
你很棒  朋友!
You rock, dude!

1082
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:46,310
去冲浪玩吧  孩子  养孩子可真是烦人
Curl away, my son. It's awesome, Jellyman.

1083
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,010
这些小家伙刚才还是蛋蛋
The little dudes are just eggs.

1084
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:49,810
我们把他们留在沙滩孵化...
We leave 'em on a beach to hatch...

1085
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,110
之后...
and then, coo-coo-cachoo...

1086
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,550
他们就自己找回了来大海的路
they find their way back to the big ol' blue.

1087
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,920
-全凭他们自己?  -是的
- All by themselves? - Yeah.

1088
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,950
但伙计  你如何知道他们自己就能行呢?
But, dude, how do you know when they're ready?

1089
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,220
嗯  其实你并不知道
Well, you never really know.

1090
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,660
但当他们回来  你就知道了  你懂吗?
But when they know, you'll know, you know? Ha.

1091
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,340
嘿  大家来看啊
Hey, look, everybody.

1092
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:12,070
我认识那个朋友!  他叫水母游侠!
I know that dude! It's the Jellyman!

1093
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:14,130
你们去吧  抱抱他吧!
Go on. Jump on him!

1094
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,370
-乌龟炸弹!  -等等!
- Turtle pile! - Wait, wait, wait!

1095
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:19,470
-你觉得好玩吗?  -你的壳在哪里?
- Are you funny? - Where's your shell?

1096
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,570
-我要透口气!  -你想逃跑吗?
- I need to breathe! - Are you running away?

1097
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,280
你真的穿过了水母群?
Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?

1098
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,290
-它们没有刺你吗?  -刺过一次!
- Did they sting you? - One at a time!

1099
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,980
鱼先生  那你死了吗?
Mr. Fish, did you die?

1100
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,550
抱歉  我也想听听
Sorry, I was a little vague on the details.

1101
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:30,750
那  你要去哪里?
So, where are you going?

1102
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,660
是这样的  我儿子被抓了
You see, my son was taken.

1103
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,530
我儿子被人类抓走了
My son was taken away from me.

1104
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,830
-胡扯  -发生了什么事?
- No way. - What happened?

1105
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:40,030
不  孩子们  我不想谈这件事
No, no, kids. I don't want to talk about it.

1106
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,400
求你  说吧
Aww! Please?

1107
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,770
求你
Please?

1108
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,540
嗯  好吧
Well, OK.

1109
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,380
我住在大堡礁  离这里很远很远
I live on this reef a long, long way from here.

1110
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:52,440
这故事会很有趣  我知道
This is gonna be good. I can tell.

1111
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,880
而我的儿子尼莫...
And my son Nemo...

1112
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,890
瞧  他故意和我闹别扭
See, he was mad at me.

1113
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,550
也许我不对他那么粗暴...
And maybe he wouldn't have done it...

1114
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,080
他不会那么做的
if I hadn't been so tough on him.

1115
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,350
谁知道呐
I don't know.

1116
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:03,380
总之  他朝深处的游艇游过去了...
Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat...

1117
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:06,290
当他到那里时  潜水员出现了...
and when he was out there, these divers appeared...

1118
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,960
我想阻止他们  但那游艇速度太快了
and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast.

1119
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,760
所以  我只好深入大海  一直跟踪...
So, we swam out in the ocean to follow them...

1120
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,130
尼莫的爸爸来不及追上它...
They couldn't stop 'em. And then Nemo's dad...

1121
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,930
他就游进了大海  碰到了...
he swims out to the ocean, and they bump into...

1122
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:17,270
...三条凶残的鲨鱼
...three ferocious sharks.

1123
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,400
他用水雷把鲨鱼吓跑了!
He scares away the sharks by blowing 'em up!

1124
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,770
天呐  他可真了不起
Golly, that's amazing.

1125
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,440
然后他下潜了几千英尺...
And then dives thousands of feet...

1126
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,210
...那里漆黑一片
...straight down into the dark.

1127
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,710
伸手不见五指
It's wicked dark down there.

1128
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,440
伸手不见五指  怎么办?
You can't see a thing. How's it going, Bob?

1129
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,140
在那里他唯一能看到的是...
And the only thing they can see down there...

1130
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,910
...来自这个巨大恐怖生物的光...
...is the light from this big, horrible creature...

1131
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:32,920
带着利刃般锋利的牙齿  躲得好  老家伙
with razor-sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man.

1132
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,320
他得尽快找到...
And then he has to blast his way...

1133
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,980
所以  这两条小鱼已经...
So, these two little fish have been...

1134
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:39,560
在东澳洋流中搜寻了几天了
searching the ocean for days on the East Australian Current.

1135
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,890
也就是说它也许现在就在这里
Which means that he may be on his way here right now.

1136
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:43,450
这可以带他到悉尼...
That should put him in Sydney Harbor...

1137
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,800
...一天之内  我是说  听起来...
...in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like...

1138
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,820
这家伙找不到他的儿子
this guy is gonna stop at nothing...

1139
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,630
是誓不罢休...  我真心地希望他能成功
...till he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it.

1140
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:52,660
我可以说这是个有责任心的父亲
That's one dedicated father, if you ask me.

1141
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,210
我的!  我的!  我的!  我的!  我的!
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1142
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:05,550
我的!  我的!  我的!  我的!  我的!  我的!
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1143
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,280
我的!  我的!  我的!  我的!  我的!  我的!
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1144
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,720
你们能住嘴吗?!
Would you just shut up?!

1145
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,230
你们简直是一群会飞的老鼠!
You're rats with wings!

1146
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,750
那条鱼一直在找他的儿子尼莫
Bloke's been looking for his boy Nemo.

1147
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,130
-尼莫?!  -他被人类带离了大堡礁...
- Nemo?! - He was taken off the reef...

1148
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:19,190
-拿去!  高兴了吧?  -我的!  我的!  我的!
- Take it! You happy? - Mine! Mine! Mine!

1149
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:22,030
嘿  再说一遍!  关于尼莫的事
Hey, say that again! Something about Nemo.

1150
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:23,230
我的!  我的!  我的!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1151
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,560
我的?
Mine?

1152
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,840
最新的消息是  他正在来这的路上
Last I heard, he's heading towards the harbor.

1153
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,310
啊!  太好了!
Ho ho! Brilliant!

1154
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:46,700
他没事吧?
Is he doing OK?

1155
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,220
他没事吧?
Is he doing OK?

1156
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,460
无论你做什么  不要提那个女孩的名字
Whatever you do, Don't mention D-a-r...

1157
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,370
没关系  我知道你们在说谁
It's OK. I know who you're talking about.

1158
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,710
吉哥?
Gill?

1159
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,910
吉哥?
Gill?

1160
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,610
嘿  鲨鱼饵
Hey, Sharkbait.

1161
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,880
对不起  我不能弄停那个...
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the...

1162
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,080
不  应该是我道歉
No, I'm the one who should be sorry.

1163
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,750
我太想出去了...
I was so ready to get out...

1164
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:19,560
太想尝尝大海的味道...
so ready to taste that ocean...

1165
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,030
为此我甚至要你去冒生命危险
I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there.

1166
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:27,020
绝对不值得这么做
Nothing should be worth that.

1167
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,300
对不起  我不能帮你会到你父亲身边  孩子
I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.

1168
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,910
好了  嘿  嘿  嘿...
All right. Hey, hey, hey...

1169
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,570
什么...
What the...

1170
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:42,350
那是拔牙的唯一方法
That's one way to pull a tooth.

1171
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,480
该死的小家伙
Huh. Darn kids.

1172
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,510
好消息是我拔对了牙  不是吗?
Good thing I pulled the right one, eh, Prime Minister?

1173
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,110
嘿!
Hey, psst!

1174
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,150
啊  祖哥!  你刚好错过了一次拔牙表演
Oh, Nigel! You just missed an extraction.

1175
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:53,820
他弄松了牙组织韧带了吗?
Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet?

1176
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,920
我在胡说些什么呀?  尼莫在哪里?
What am I talking about? Where's Nemo?

1177
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:58,300
-我有话要跟他说  -是什么?
- I've got to speak with him. - What is it?

1178
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,430
你的爸爸正在穿越整个大海...
Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean...

1179
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,100
-就为了找到你  -我父亲?  真的吗?
- looking for you. - My father? Really?

1180
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:07,270
他辗转数百海里  打败鲨鱼穿越水母群...
He's traveled hundreds of miles, battling sharks and jellyfish...

1181
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,800
鲨鱼?  那不可能是他
Sharks? That can't be him.

1182
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:12,440
它是什么鱼来着?  一种观赏鱼
What was his name? Some sort of sport fish.

1183
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,640
-金枪鱼?  鳟鱼?  -马林?
- Tuna? Trout? - Marlin?

1184
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,510
对  他的名字叫马林!  来自大堡礁的小丑鱼
Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef.

1185
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,150
是我老爸!  他打败鲨鱼了!
It's my dad! He took on a shark!

1186
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,520
我听说是三条
I heard he took on three.

1187
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,390
-三条鲨鱼?  -那可是四千八百颗牙齿!
- Three sharks? - That's 4,800 teeth!

1188
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,520
自从你被那条船抓走后...
After you were taken by Diver Dan over there...

1189
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,790
你父亲像疯了一样跟着那艘船
your dad followed the boat like a maniac.

1190
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:30,200
真的?
Really?

1191
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:32,030
他追啊追  不顾一切得追
He's swimming, giving it all he's got...

1192
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,130
突然三条鲨鱼碰到了他...
and then three gigantic sharks capture him...

1193
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,430
他炸飞了他们  然后潜到了几千英尺下面...
and he blows them up and dives thousands of feet...

1194
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:39,300
又被长着巨大牙齿的怪兽追捕!
and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth!

1195
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:41,970
他把那个怪兽绑在了岩石上  他得到了什么奖赏呢?
He ties this demon to a rock, and what's his reward?

1196
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:44,380
他和整个水母群战斗!
He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest!

1197
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:47,610
现在他正和一群海龟在东流上...
Now he's with a bunch of sea turtles on the E.A. C...

1198
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:51,140
顺着东澳暖流直奔悉尼!
and the word is he's headed this way right now... to Sydney!

1199
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:52,550
多么了不起的爸爸!
What a good daddy!

1200
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:55,150
他终于来找你了  鲨鱼饵
He was looking for you after all, Sharkbait.

1201
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,290
他向过滤器游去了!
He's swimming to the filter!

1202
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,820
-鲨鱼饵!  -别再这样了!
- Sharkbait! - Not again!

1203
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:06,300
鲨鱼饵!
Sharkbait!

1204
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,700
不!
No!

1205
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,930
你在拿你的生命冒险!
You got your whole life ahead of you!

1206
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:11,370
-我们会帮你的  孩子!  -把他弄出来!
- We'll help you, kid! - Get him out!

1207
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,340
把他弄出来!
Get him out of there!

1208
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,010
快点  孩子!  抓住末端!
Come on, kid! Grab the end!

1209
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,640
鲨鱼饵!
Sharkbait!

1210
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,710
-不!  -听到我的话了吗?
- No! - Can you hear me?

1211
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,240
尼莫!  你听得到吗?
Nemo! Can you hear me?

1212
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:27,310
是的  我听得到
Yeah, I can hear you.

1213
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,290
鲨鱼饵  你成功了!
Sharkbait, you did it!

1214
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,120
鲨鱼饵  你...  身上全都是细菌!  啊!
Sharkbait, you're... covered with germs!

1215
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,230
真勇敢  孩子
Ha ha! That took guts, kid.

1216
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,580
好了  弟兄们  达拉回来之前
All right, gang, we have less than 48 hours...

1217
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,950
到那时候这个水箱会脏乱不堪...
before Darla gets here.

1218
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:40,790
我们只有不到48小时的时间
This tank'll get plenty dirty in that time...

1219
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,670
我们要尽量努力搞脏它
but we have to help it along any way we can.

1220
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,970
-虾虾?  停止清理  -我尽力而为
- Jacques? No cleaning. - I shall resist.

1221
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:48,670
其他人尽可能搞脏这里
Everybody else, be as gross as possible.

1222
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:49,940
用肮脏的方法思维
Think dirty thoughts.

1223
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,170
我们要搞的这个水箱  脏到...
We're gonna make this tank so filthy...

1224
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:54,740
那个牙医不得不清理的地步
the dentist will have to clean it.

1225
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,880
干得好!
Good work!

1226
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,950
好了  我们到了  伙计们!
All right, we're here, dudes!

1227
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:09,190
准备!  你出口就要到了  伙计!
Get ready! Your exit's coming up, man!

1228
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,720
哪里?  我看不到!
Where? I don't see it!

1229
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:13,200
就在那边!  我看到了!  我看到了!
Right there! I see it! I see it!

1230
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,360
你是说那个恐怖的漩涡?
The swirling vortex of terror?

1231
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:18,700
-是的  伙计  -就是
- That's it, dude. - Of course it is.

1232
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:22,770
好了  首先  找一个冲出去的伙伴
OK, first, find your exit buddy.

1233
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:25,300
找到冲出去的伙伴了吗?
Do you have your exit buddy?

1234
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:26,580
是的!
Yes!

1235
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:31,350
小虎还会给你演示正确的起跳姿势
Squirt give you a rundown of proper exiting technique.

1236
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:34,910
下午好!  今天我们要进行最刺激的跳跃!
Good afternoon! We'll have a great jump today!

1237
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,650
好  碰到水壁时  要使劲的往回冲
OK, crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall.

1238
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:41,630
漩涡下面有厉害的回旋!
There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out!

1239
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,930
记住...  快接  快滑!
Remember... rip it, roll it, and punch it!

1240
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:48,090
我看出来了  它好像是跟我说话呐!
He's trying to speak to me, I know it!

1241
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:51,370
听着  你讲得很棒  但我一句也没听懂!
You're really cute, but I don't know what you're saying!

1242
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,670
你再重复一遍  好吗
Say the first thing again.

1243
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,230
好的  水母游侠!  出发!
OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!

1244
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:12,190
这很...有趣!
That was... fun!

1245
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,490
我真得觉得很过瘾啊
I actually enjoyed that.

1246
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,160
嘿  瞧  乌龟们!
Hey, look, turtles!

1247
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,130
很完美!
Ha ha! Most excellent!

1248
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,930
启动你的鱼尾吧...
Now turn your fishy tails around...

1249
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:24,170
直接游向悉尼吧!
and swim straight on through to Sydney!

1250
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,370
旅途愉快  伙计!
No worries, man!

1251
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,470
一路顺风!  谢谢  龟龟朋友!
No worries! Thank you, dude Crush!

1252
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:31,070
-再见!  -再见  水母游侠!
- Bye! - Bye, Jellyman!

1253
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:33,410
转告你的小家伙  我的问候  好吗?
You tell your little dude I said hi, OK?

1254
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,610
回头见  伙计们!
See ya later, dudes!

1255
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,380
再见  大家!
Bye, everyone!

1256
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,750
尼莫应该会喜欢这个的
Nemo would have loved this.

1257
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:42,120
啊!  嘿!  龟龟  我忘了!
Ooh! Hey! Crush, I forgot!

1258
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,720
你多大了?
How old are you?

1259
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,960
150岁  朋友!  还很年轻!
150, dude! And still young! Rock on!

1260
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,020
150岁!  150岁!  我可不会忘的
150! 150! I gotta remember that.

1261
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:53,260
哇
Whoa.

1262
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,700
-是往那边走吗?  -没错
- We going in there? - Yep.

1263
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,800
悉尼  袋鼠路  42号  歇尔曼?
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1264
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:08,480
没错  我们只要直着游就行了
Yep. We're gonna just swim straight.

1265
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,280
只要继续游  只要继续游
Just keep swimming, just keep swimming

1266
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,480
多莉...
Dory...

1267
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,890
天呐  这还要花一段时间
Boy, this is taking awhile.

1268
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:25,630
我们玩个猜谜游戏如何?
How about we play a game?

1269
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:26,930
好的
OK.

1270
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,030
好  我在想一种橙色的...
OK, I'm thinking of something orange...

1271
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:31,560
个子小的...
and it's small...

1272
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:33,900
-就是我  -对!
- It's me. - Right!

1273
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:37,500
橙色的  小的...
It's orange and small...

1274
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:38,840
就是我
It's me.

1275
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,780
没错  机灵鬼先生
All righty, Mr. Smartypants.

1276
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,680
橙色的  而且  有白条纹的...
And it's orange and small and white stripes...

1277
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,980
橙色的  而且  有白条纹的...
And it's orange and small and white stripes...

1278
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,250
我  我猜下一个谜语的答案
Me. And the next one, just a guess, me.

1279
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:48,810
-还是我  你吓坏我了  -等等
- That's just scary. - Wait, wait, wait.

1280
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,690
我之前肯定是见过这个漂浮物
I have definitely seen this floating speck before.

1281
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:52,250
也就是说  我们之前来过这里...
That means we've passed it before...

1282
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:53,660
也就是说  我们在兜圈...
and that means we're going in circles...

1283
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,250
也就是说  我们没有走直线!
and that means we're not going straight!

1284
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,460
-嘿  嘿!  -到水面去看看
- Hey, hey! - Get to the surface.

1285
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,090
上到那里我们会搞清楚的  走吧!
We'll figure it out up there. Let's go!

1286
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,330
-嘿!  放松点  -什么?
- Hey! Relax. - What?

1287
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,960
深呼吸
Take a deep breath.

1288
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:06,410
现在  我们去找个人问一下路
Now, let's ask somebody for directions.

1289
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:08,210
现在  我们去找个人问一下路
Now, let's ask somebody for directions.

1290
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,270
很好  你想问谁  那个漂浮物吗?
Fine. Who do you want to ask, the speck?

1291
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:12,680
-这儿没有其他鱼!  -一定有其他的鱼
- There's nobody here! - There has to be someone.

1292
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:15,580
这是大海  笨蛋  不会只有我们两个
It's the ocean, silly. We're not the only two in here.

1293
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,950
让我瞧瞧  是的  这边没有
Let's see. OK, no one there.

1294
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:22,450
空空如也
Nope. Nada.

1295
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,660
那里有鱼  嘿!  打扰
There's somebody. Hey! Excuse...

1296
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:27,530
多莉  多莉  多莉!  该我出题了
Dory, Dory, Dory! Now it's my turn.

1297
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,150
我想这是某种可怕神秘的东西
I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.

1298
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,560
是一种我们不了解的鱼  如果我们向它问路...
It's a fish we don't know. lf we ask it directions...

1299
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,630
他可能会把我们吞下去  再吐出我们的骨头!
it could ingest us and spit out our bones!

1300
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:36,140
一个大男人问个路怎么也这么麻烦?
What is it with men and asking for directions?

1301
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,970
我现在不想说男人和女人的问题
I don't want to play the gender card right now.

1302
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,940
我们只想说保命的问题
Let's play the "Let's Not Die" card.

1303
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,880
-你想离开这里吗?  -当然想
- You want to get out of here? - Of course I do.

1304
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:45,180
除非我们问他  不然我们怎么离开这里呢?
How are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot?

1305
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,200
多莉  你没有完全明白...
Dory, you don't fully understand...

1306
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,240
别这样  相信我
Come on. Trust me on this.

1307
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:01,160
好吧
All right.

1308
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,430
打扰了!  小家伙?
Excuse me! Whoo-hoo! Little fella?

1309
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:07,300
你好!  别没礼貌  打招呼呀
Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi.

1310
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,390
你好!  别没礼貌  打招呼呀
Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi.

1311
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,460
你好
Ha. Hello.

1312
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:12,030
-他的儿子槟格...  -是尼莫
- His son Bingo... - Nemo.

1313
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:15,100
-尼莫被抓到...  -悉尼
- Nemo was taken to... - Sydney.

1314
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:18,280
悉尼!  尽快赶到那里
Sydney! And it's really, really important...

1315
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,310
对我们来说真得很重要
that we get there as fast as we can...

1316
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,440
你能帮我们吗?
so can you help us out?

1317
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,010
别这样  小家伙  求你了
Come on, little fella. Come on.

1318
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,290
多莉  我才是小家伙
Dory, I'm a little fella.

1319
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,830
我不认为那是个小家伙
I don't think that's a little fella.

1320
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:36,730
啊!  大家伙  鲸  好
Oh! Big fella. Whale. OK.

1321
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:39,230
也许他只会说鲸语
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1322
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:42,500
我...我们  想...想要
Mooo! Weee neeed...

1323
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:46,630
-多莉?  -找...找到...到他的儿子
- Dory? - Tooo fiind his son.

1324
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,410
你在干什么?  你肯定你说的是鲸语?
What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale?

1325
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:52,770
你...你能告诉我们方...方向吗?
Can youuuu give us diiirectionsss?

1326
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:55,150
多莉!  只有鬼知道你在说什么!
Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying!

1327
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:58,780
-瞧  他游走了  -回...回...来...来
- See, he's swimming away. - Cooome baaack.

1328
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,080
他不会回来了  他一定生气了
He's not coming back. You offended him.

1329
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,320
-也许该用另一种鲸语
- Maybe a different dialect.

1330
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,550
多莉!
Dory!

1331
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:08,950
这根本不是鲸语  你说得是胡话
This is not whale. You're speaking upset stomach.

1332
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:11,100
-也许我应该试试座头鲸语  -别
- Maybe I should try humpback. - Don't.

1333
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:15,600
-难听死了  -也许该更大声点吗?
- You actually sound sick. - Maybe louder?

1334
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,100
别这样!
Don't do that!

1335
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,870
太像虎鲸了  听起来像虎鲸吗?
Too much orca. Didn't it sound orca-ish?

1336
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,240
行了  不像虎鲸
It doesn't sound orca.

1337
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,070
你说得什么鱼都不像
It sounds like nothing I've ever heard.

1338
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:25,210
也许此时  他正饿着呢
It's just as well. He might be hungry.

1339
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:26,580
也许此时  他正饿着呢
It's just as well. He might be hungry.

1340
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:29,610
鲸不吃小丑鱼  他们吃海虾
Whales don't eat clownfish. They eat krill.

1341
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:33,180
-快游开!  -啊  瞧  海虾!
- Swim away! - Oh, look, krill!

1342
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,560
快跑  多莉  快跑!
Move, Dory, move!

1343
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,120
快跑  多莉  快跑!
Move, Dory, move!

1344
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,930
瞧  你看到了吗?
Look at that. Would you look at that?

1345
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:50,930
肮脏  绝对肮脏
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1346
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,960
谢谢你  孩子  这都是你的功劳
All thanks to you, kid. You made it possible.

1347
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,030
虾虾  我说过不用清理
Jacques, I said no cleaning.

1348
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:57,910
我受不了
I am ashamed.

1349
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:00,410
瞧!  垃圾天使!
Look! Scum angel!

1350
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,550
泡泡!  我爱泡泡!
Bubbles! I love the bubbles!

1351
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:12,250
亮亮?  有人见过亮亮吗?
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?

1352
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:14,920
9:00  牙医来了
9:00 and cue dentist.

1353
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,230
你好  芭芭拉  对不起我迟到了
Hello, Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

1354
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:19,960
好  我们做好准备  我们做好准备  好的
OK, here we go. Here we go, OK.

1355
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,730
小大卫  雷诺斯  你好吗...
Little Davey Reynolds...

1356
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,360
走向工作台了  放下钥匙...
Walks to the counter, drops the keys...

1357
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,500
张开  真令人恶心!
Bloat, that's disgusting!

1358
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,570
对我来说味道不错
Tastes pretty good to me.

1359
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:32,280
人类哪知道这是我们鱼类的杰作!
Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own...

1360
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:33,410
嘘!  他来了!
Shh! Here he comes!

1361
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:38,750
奇怪  真是脏透了
Crikey. What a state.

1362
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:44,350
啊  芭芭拉  我明天最早的预约是几点?
Ohh. Barbara, what's my earliest appointment tomorrow?

1363
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:47,330
-10:00整  -10点之前不接病人  听到了吗?
- 10:00, luv. - Leave it open, would you?

1364
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,690
在达拉到这里之前  我得清理下鱼缸
I've gotta clean the fish tank before Darla gets here.

1365
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:51,820
你听到了吗  鲨鱼饵?
Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

1366
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:55,560
是的!  他要清理鱼缸!
Yay! He's gonna clean the tank!

1367
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,370
我们可以出去了!
We're gonna be clean!

1368
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:59,070
你准备好去见你老爸了吗  孩子?
You ready to see your dad, kid?

1369
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,040
你当然准备好了
Of course you are.

1370
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,710
我想他一定在海港那边的码头上
I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there...

1371
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:06,430
等着迎接你呐
in the harbor waiting for you right now.

1372
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,380
是的
Yeah.

1373
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:26,110
来了一个大浪
Here comes the big one.

1374
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:28,680
啊!  快点!  你别错过机会!
Ooh! Come on! You gotta try this!

1375
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,990
-你能不能别闹了?  -为什么?  有什么问题吗?
- Will you just stop it? - Why? What's wrong?

1376
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:34,320
我们在鲸鱼的肚子里面  你还不明白吗?
We're in a whale, don't you get it?

1377
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:35,520
-鲸鱼?  -一头鲸鱼!
- Whale? - A whale!

1378
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,290
这都怪你问什么路!  这就是问路的下场!
You had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here!

1379
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:41,100
鲸鱼  你知道的  我懂鲸语
Wow, a whale. I speak whale.

1380
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:43,470
不  你疯了!  你根本不会说鲸语!
No, you're insane! You can't speak whale!

1381
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,700
我得出去!  我得去找我儿子!
I have to get out! I have to find my son!

1382
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:52,150
我的告诉他海龟有多老!
I have to tell him how old sea turtles are!

1383
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,990
嘿...
Hey...

1384
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:08,290
你没事吧?
you OK?

1385
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:17,360
别这样  一切都会好起来的
There, there. It's all right.

1386
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:19,340
会没事的
It'll be OK.

1387
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:21,600
不  不  不会的
No. No, it won't.

1388
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,870
肯定会没事的  等着瞧
Sure it will. You'll see.

1389
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:30,040
不  我向他保证过  不会让他有任何事的
No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.

1390
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,490
真是奇怪的许诺
Huh. That's a funny thing to promise.

1391
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,890
什么?
What?

1392
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,360
你不可能不让他出任何事情
You can't never let anything happen to him.

1393
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:39,830
那等于不让他做任何事情
Then nothing would ever happen to him.

1394
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:45,630
那他什么乐趣也没有了
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1395
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,310
发生什么事了?
What's going on?

1396
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,640
不知道  我要问问他
Don't know. I'll ask him.

1397
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:07,210
-多莉...  -发...发生什么事了?
- Dory... - Whaaat's goooing onnn?

1398
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,850
我想他嫌我们太吵了
I think he says we've stopped.

1399
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:18,160
我们是够吵的了  不要再说什么鲸语了
Of course we've stopped. Stop trying to speak whale.

1400
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,000
你会令一切变得更糟  那是什么声音音?
You'll make things worse. What is that noise?

1401
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,900
啊  不  瞧你都干了些什么呀
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1402
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:32,900
水位在下降  在下降!
The water's going down. It's going down!

1403
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,050
真的?  你肯定吗?
Really? You sure about that?

1404
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:40,140
瞧!  水只剩下一半了!
Look! Already it's half empty!

1405
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:41,950
应该说还有一半
I'd say it's half full.

1406
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:43,460
够了!  还剩一半
Stop that! It's half empty!

1407
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:49,720
好  这句可不大好翻译
OK, that one was a little tougher.

1408
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,660
他或许在说我们应该进他的喉咙去...
He either said we should go to the back of the throat...

1409
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,860
或者他想喝点无酒精饮料
or he wants a root beer float.

1410
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,530
这话不是明摆着的嘛!
Of course he wants us to go there!

1411
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:58,500
他是要吃掉我们了!
That's eating us!

1412
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:02,050
我的味道如何  大家伙?  我的味道很好吧?
How do I taste, Moby? Do I taste good?

1413
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:03,810
告诉他我对成为他的午餐没兴趣!
Tell him I'm not interested in being lunch!

1414
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,310
-好的  他...他...  -别对他说了!
- OK. Heee... - Stop talking to him!

1415
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:13,650
怎么了?
What is going on?

1416
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:15,990
我看看  什么...么事...
I'll check. Whaaat...

1417
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,790
不要再说鲸语了!  你不会说鲸语了!
No more whale! You can't speak whale!

1418
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,160
-我会!  -你不会!
- Yes, I can! - No, you can't!

1419
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,760
你以为你会  但其实你不会  尼莫!
You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nemo!

1420
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:32,600
-好了  -多莉  别!
- OK. - Dory! Oof!

1421
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:38,770
他说是让我们离开的时候了
He says it's time to let go.

1422
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:40,780
一切都会没事的
Everything's gonna be all right.

1423
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:42,480
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

1424
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,610
你怎么知道我们不会碰上倒霉的事情?
How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen?

1425
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:47,550
我不知道!
I don't!

1426
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:12,940
我们还活着!
Ha ha ha! We're alive!

1427
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:16,880
瞧!  悉-尼...悉尼!
Look! Sy-d-ney... Sydney!

1428
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,350
悉尼!  又是悉尼!
Sydney! Sydney again!

1429
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,820
你是对的  多莉!  我们成功了!
You were right, Dory! We made it!

1430
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:26,790
我们会找到我儿子的!
We're gonna find my son!

1431
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,180
谢...谢...你...先...生!
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

1432
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,370
我真希望我会说鲸语
Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

1433
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,700
我们要做的是找到抓走他的那艘船
All we gotta do is find the boat that took him.

1434
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:40,830
-对!  -我们行的!
- Right! - We can do this!

1435
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:56,750
早
Morning.

1436
01:13:56,790 --> 01:14:00,060
是早晨了  大家!  今天就是那个逃亡日!
It's morning, everyone! Today's the day!

1437
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:02,260
阳光明媚  鱼缸乾净了...
The sun is shining, the tank is clean...

1438
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,360
我们就要出去了...  鱼缸乾净了
and we are getting out... The tank is clean.

1439
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,960
鱼缸乾净了!
The tank is clean!

1440
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,590
怎么会?
But how?

1441
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,330
当我们熟睡的时候  一定是牙医装了这个
Boss must've installed it while we were sleeping.

1442
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:15,830
-我们该怎么做?  -有什么办法  桃桃?
- What are we gonna do? - What's it say, Peach?

1443
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:18,540
我听不到  桃桃
I can't hear you, Peach.

1444
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,010
2003水得清  具有自动清洁
The Aquascum 2003 is an all-purpose, self-cleaning...

1445
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:23,020

that is guaranteed to extend the life of your aquarium fish.

1447
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:27,310
别说了!
Stop it!

1448
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:28,840
2003水得清设定为...
The Aquascum is programmed to scan...

1449
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:31,190
每五分钟扫瞄一次你的鱼缸
your tank environment every five minutes?!

1450
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:32,920
扫瞄?  那是什么意思?
Scan? What does that mean?

1451
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,280
温度...华氏82度...
Temperature... 82 degrees...

1452
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,060
酸硷值...正常
PH balance... normal.

1453
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,500
-啊  -不错

1454
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:48,100
啊...啊!  去死吧  水得清!
Ooh... Oh! Curse you, Aquascum!

1455
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:50,240
我们的逃跑计划又完了
That's it for the escape plan. It's ruined.

1456
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,710
那我们下步做什么...
Then what are we gonna do about...

1457

躲起来  孩子!
Stay down, kid!

1459
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:58,390
虚惊一场
False alarm.

1460
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:00,510
我的神经再也经受不了了
My nerves can't take much more of this.

1461
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,780
我们该怎么对付那个金鱼杀手?
What'll we do when that brat gets here?

1462
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:05,050
-我正在考虑  -啊!  吉哥!

1467
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,370
干得好!
Ha ha! Good work!

1468
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:19,930
吉哥!

1469
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:21,570
-尼莫!  -鲨鱼饵!

1470
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:25,010
-快打滚  孩子!  -翻过来!  翻过来!
- Roll, kid! - Lean! Lean!

1471
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,920
差点就掉下去了
Whoops. That would've been a nasty fall.

1472
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:34,550
吉哥!  我不想死!
Gill! Don't let me go belly-up!

1473
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:36,890
冷静  尼莫  你不会死的
Just calm down, Nemo. You won't go belly-up.

1474
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,320
我保证  你不会有事的
I promise. You're gonna be OK.

1475
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,320
达拉!
Darla!

1476
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,530
这些船里面  有没有你觉得熟悉的?
Do any of these boats look familiar to you?

1477
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:53,470
没有  但那艘船一定在这里的某个地方
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere.

1478
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:55,630
快点  多莉  我们要找到它
Come on, Dory. We're gonna find it.

1479
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,410
我太兴奋了  你兴奋吗?

1480
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:00,210
多莉  醒醒  醒醒  快点

鸭子!
Duck!

1482
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:05,520
那不是鸭子  那是...鹈鹕!
That's not a duck. It's a... pelican!

1483
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:18,130
不!  我来从这么远来  不是为了当他早餐的!
No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast!

1484
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,110
嘿  祖哥  你瞧那边?
Hey, Nigel. Would you look at that?

1485
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:29,510
什么?  什么?
What? What?

1486
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:32,410
太阳刚刚升起  而吉拉德就被撑得走不动了
Sun's barely up and Gerald's had more than he can handle.

1487
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:35,070
是的  找个人去帮帮这个可怜的家伙吧
Yeah. Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy.

那就不劳你们大驾了
Don't everybody fly off at once.

1490
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:46,830
没事的  吉拉德  鱼塞住你的舌头了吗?
All right, Gerald. Fish got your tongue?

1491
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,560
我得去找我儿子尼莫!
I gotta find my son Nemo!

1492
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,690
尼莫?  他就是那条鱼!

1493
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:57,300
那条打遍大海无敌手的鱼!
The one that's been fighting the whole ocean!

1494

千万别轻举妄动

1500
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:24,960
要想活命  就跳进我的嘴里
Hop inside my mouth if you want to live.

1501
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,630
跳进你的嘴里?  那我们怎么能活命吗?
Hop in your mouth? How does that make me live?

1502
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:29,830

- Yeah, right. - No. I know your son.

他是橙色的  有一边鳍有残障
He's orange with a gimpy fin on one side.

1506
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,140
那是尼莫!

一闪  一闪  小星星

1515

我要搬走!  找个安全的地方!
Find a happy place! Find a happy place!

1516
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,120
达拉  你的叔叔要立刻见你

好的  我们来看看那些小乳牙
All right, let's see those pearly whites.

1518
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:42,040
我是食人鱼  住在亚马逊河
Raah! I'm a piranha. They're in the Amazon.

1519
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,510
食人鱼也是一种鱼  就像你的生日礼物一样
And a piranha's a fish, just like your present.

1520
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,640

- He's still alive! - He's not dead!

1527
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,690
怎么了?  他为什么要装死?
What's happening? Why is he playing dead?

1528
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,590
它会被冲进下水道的
He's gonna get flushed down the toilet.

1529
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:07,030
-他要离开这里了!  -他将被冲走!
- He's gonna get out of here! - He's gonna get flushed!

1530
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:08,830

1532
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:11,770
尼莫!  不!

1533
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:15,210
-嘿!  我找到他爸爸了!  -尼莫在哪里?
- Hey! I found his dad! - Where's Nemo?

1534
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,610
-牙医!  -他在那边!
- Dentist! - He's over there!

1535
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,040
什么是牙医?  祖哥  快进去!

别动!
Hold still!

1542
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:44,200
没有人会伤害你的!
Nobody's going to hurt you! Oof!

1543
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,680
尼莫
Nemo.

1544
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:53,980

1550
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:05,660
小鱼?

1562
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:41,190
吉哥!

- I'm so happy! - Is he gonna be OK, Gill?

1567

别担心  条条水管通大海
Don't worry. All drains lead to the ocean.

1568
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:05,780
小鱼!

1579
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:34,330

It's over, Dory. We were too late.

1580
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:39,140
尼莫死了  我现在也要回家了
Nemo's gone, and I'm going home now.
