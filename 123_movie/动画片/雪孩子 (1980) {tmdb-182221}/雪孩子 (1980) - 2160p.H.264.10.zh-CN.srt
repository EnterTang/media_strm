1,110 --> 00:01:35,388
Be a good girl. Help me find more carrots.

1
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,900
Look! Here they are.

2
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,346
Hey, you!

3
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,029
These two longan seeds were given
by Sister Swallow.

4
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,029
I'll plant one of them right next to the door
when spring comes.

5
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,664
And plant the other one on the other
side of the door.

6
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,218
Then we'll have two longan trees.

7
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,946
Ho ho... l'll plant the seeds with you next spring

8
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,345
Now you keep the seeds safe.

9
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,348
And I'll go and find some radishes, my baby.

10
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,063
I'll go with you. Let me go with you.

11
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,350
It's cold outside. Come and get warm by the fire.
Don't go with me.

12
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,146
No

13
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,344
I'll go with you. Let me go with you.

14
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,189
I'm so lonely without you, Mom.

15
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,901
Ah. I've got an idea. I'll make a snowman for you.

16
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,460
Then you won't feel lonely with her company.

17
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,505
Make a snowman.

18
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,102
Ah

19
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,101
Great! We're making a snowman.

20
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,224
Oh! Great! We're making a snowman.

21
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,266
Taking on my shovel, La la la...

22
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,579
Going with the snowball, La la la...

23
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,103
The wind is whistling, La la la...

24
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,020
The snowflakes are dancing, La la la...

25
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,267
The birds on the trees are singing

26
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:04,428
The snowman is growing taller and taller.

27
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:16,060
We finish making the snowman. La la la...

28
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,026
Gone with the Wind song Manshan. La la la...

29
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:26,105
How beautiful the snowman is. La la la...

30
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,265
She's smiling at me. La la la...

31
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:39,343
he birds on the trees are singing...
My friends, La la la...

32
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,745
are having a good time.

33
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:52,025
Look! What a lovely snow child!

34
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,661
But she's missing the most important thing.

35
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,069
Ah, she's missing something.

36
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,463
Oh, I see. She's missing two eyes.

37
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,580
What should be do?

38
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,865
Well...

39
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,098
Look!

40
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,104
Look! She's got eyes!

41
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,940
Mom, how beautiful she is!

42
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,187
Oh, she needs a nose!

43
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,467
Oh, you don't like this nose.

44
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,578
My mom will bring you a nice nose.
I'll give you a new nose in a minute.

45
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,101
Mom! How handsome our snow child is!

46
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,145
Yes. You've got company.
I'll go and look for some radishes.

47
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,338
It's cold outside. Come inside after having fun.

48
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,346
Ah

49
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:58,387
Don't forget to bring a pretty nose
to the snow child, mom!

50
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,147
Ah

51
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,469
We're good friends now.
Why don't you move closer!

52
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:18,266
You're so cold, my friend.
Let's move closer to the fire.

53
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,226
Oh, you are not afraid of the chill.

54
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:34,942
Snowflakes, snowflakes, the pure white
snowflakes.

55
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:49,505
Floating gently in the sky, floating over the
greatest mountains

56
00:12:49,910 --> 00:13:03,381
Snowflakes, snowflakes, my lovely snowflakes

57
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:18,741
Round and round, round and round,
playing with me

58
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:42,978
Come over, come over, little rabbit.

59
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:54,540
Come over, and join me in the skiing.
Join me in the skiing.

60
00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:14,422
Let our songs be heard, La la la...
Some of my friends how happy.

61
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:30,225
Round and round, round and round,
the field forest is my family

62
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,469
Mom, Mom!

63
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:22,338
Ah! My Baby! My Baby!

64
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,544
Mom!

65
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,829
Mom!

66
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:38,579
Here's a carrot for you, my baby!

67
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,100
No... The snow child is gone.

68
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:05,823
What a good children. Look, my baby.
Our snow child has turned into the clear water.

69
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:22,903
I see the white clouds in the blue sky.

70
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:39,423
Look over there! The snow child is with us.
La la la...

71
00:19:40,510 --> 00:20:09,350
La la la. It more beautiful is more lovable. La la
la. She's got the purest heart. The purest heart.

72
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,501
Mom, will the snow child come back to us?

73
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,748
Look! Isn't she with us now?
