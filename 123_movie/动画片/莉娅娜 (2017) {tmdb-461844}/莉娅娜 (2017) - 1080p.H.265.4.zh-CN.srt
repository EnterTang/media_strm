1
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,715
Repeat after me, okay?

2
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,901
Oh, Paul, leave me alone.

3
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,172
-Bon app¨¦tit.
-Bon app¨¦tit.

4
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,725
Butter.

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,651
Oh, my goodness.

6
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,071
You have to taste this.

7
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,658
Here.

8
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,377
I mean. . . It's. . .

9
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,712
-I know.
-But I'm. . .

10
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:13,216
I know. I know. I know.

11
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:21,390
Look at that! Oh, Paul, it's so beautiful !

12
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,732
Slow down.

13
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,318
Sorry.

14
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,330
This is it. Look, right. . . Just stop.

15
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,795
I can't believe we get to live here.

16
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,798
Paul !

17
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,492
Is this a mistake?
Should we have stayed in Brooklyn?

18
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,495
We're gonna love Queens.
Queens is beautiful.

19
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,919
Moving truck's here.

20
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,473
You okay?

21
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,434
-Everything is falling down.
-Hey.

22
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,811
What are we doing here?

23
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,605
Repeat after me.

24
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,860
-Nine hundred square feet.
-Nine hundred square feet.

25
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,863
Plus, it's close to your office.

26
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,033
Plus, it's close to my office,
but we don't have to move.

27
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:49,205
We could renege on the lease,
repack everything and live in the Jeep.

28
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,960
You're right. You're right.

29
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,673
-Eric, what is that noise?
-What noise?

30
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,719
Is it going to be like this every night?

31
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,807
Maybe.

32
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,022
Jule?

33
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,235
It's Versailles.

34
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,824
I'm so happy you like it, darling.

35
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,488
Good morning,
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,

36
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:46,947
LMDC .

37
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,826
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,
Julie Powell.

38
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:56,248
-My son died in the second tower.
-I'm sorry.

39
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,754
I'm so sorry.

40
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,299
Are you the person to speak to
if I don't like the plan for the memorial

41
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,927
-that was in this morning's Times?
-You can speak to me.

42
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,346
-Do you have any power?
-No.

43
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,266
I wanna speak to someone with power.
I don't like the plan.

44
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,560
I don't like the plan either.

45
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,314
You people are a bunch of
heartless bureaucratic goons.

46
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,982
l am not a heartless bureaucratic goon.

47
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,277
l am just a person in a cubicle,
and I am doing the best I can, ma'am.

48
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,239
This is my sixth phone call
and the only thing anyone ever tells me is

49
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,283
I have to fill out a form to get in line
for an insurance payment.

50
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:35,287
And you do. But, I mean, if you don't wanna
fill out a form I will fill one out for you,

51
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,456
but you're still going to have to come in
and sign it.

52
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,376
-To your cubicle?
-Yes.

53
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,171
l feel terrible about what you're going
through, Mr. Diamond, but. . .

54
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,299
You have no idea what I'm going
through, Ms. Powell. You have no idea.

55
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,386
-Please don't yell at me.
-This whoIe thing is completeIy inefficient.

56
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,887
-Please stop yelling at me.
-It's ridicuIous.

57
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,515
-My 3-year-oId is more capabIe of heIping.
-I am your friend.

58
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,353
And now the doctor says there's fibergIass
in his Iungs.

59
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:04,441
He coughs. He never stops coughing.
I don't know what to do.

60
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,944
His wife says there's so much crap
in his lungs he can't breathe,

61
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,281
and now his insurance is refusing to pay
for this drug that might really work.

62
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,742
-Tell her to call the Health Department.
-That's an answering machine.

63
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,246
Andrea Gomez in the mayor's office.

64
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,457
Thank you. Thank you.

65
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,347
Chocolate cream pie.

66
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,353
-You know what I love about cooking?
-What's that?

67
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,856
I love that after a day when nothing is sure,

68
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,196
and when I say "nothing" I mean nothing,
you can come home and absolutely know

69
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,116
that if you add egg yolks to chocolate
and sugar and milk,

70
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,661
it will get thick. It's such a comfort.

71
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,080
Bad day?

72
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,126
When will this pie be ready?

73
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,879
Soon, but I have to make
the whipped cream first and let it set.

74
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,465
I'll be here. It's a masterpiece.

75
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,637
Ritual Cobb salad lunch tomorrow.

76
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,640
Dreading, dreading, dreading.

77
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,185
Subway.

78
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,728
-Hi.
-Hi.

79
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,188
How are you?

80
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,816
What can I get for you ladies?

81
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,944
I wilI have a Cobb salad, no bleu cheese.

82
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,905
-Cobb salad, no beets.
-Cobb salad, no bacon.

83
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,157
-Cobb salad, no eggs.
-Okay, tell them. . .

84
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:40,162
Are you listening carefully, Tracy?
Tell them to take the offer up to 1 85.

85
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,747
-Here she goes.
-Repeat after me, Tracy.

86
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,791
-1 -8-5.
-What's going on?

87
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,877
And call me the second you hear back.

88
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,464
My assistant.
It's almost not worth having one.

89
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,383
I know. Yesterday I said to Allison,

90
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,635
"Go to the pharmacy,
get me a pair of black pantyhose."

91
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,595
She came back and said,
"They didn't have any."

92
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,058
I said, "Did you try another pharmacy?"
I mean, really.

93
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,019
Or Bloomingdale's.
What's wrong with trying Bloomingdale's?

94
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,772
Yeah, I don't get it.
If only I could be my own assistant.

95
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,232
You can be.

96
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:12,111
Fire your assistant
and don't hire a replacement.

97
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,822
No, that's not what I mean, Julie.

98
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,032
Excuse me. Oh. . .

99
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,244
-Oh, those are cute.
-Oh, thanks. Thanks.

100
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:25,833
Okay, tell them 1 90 , 1 -9-0 . Great.

101
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,544
"1-9-0." What? What are you up to?

102
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,548
$1 90 million.
We're assembling a parcel at Midtown.

103
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,259
Oh, wow. Oh, oh, that is so great, Cassie.

104
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,969
A parcel of what?

105
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,305
Buildings.

106
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,141
We're gonna tear them alI down
and put up a high-rise.

107
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,767
-To your parcel.
-Thank you.

108
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,857
And enough about you, here's to me.

109
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:54,862
As of yesterday, I am the senior vice
president in charge of corporate publicity.

110
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,697
-No.
-Which means I get a raise

111
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,659
and I can borrow haIf a million dollars
at 2% if I want to.

112
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,703
-Great.
-If you want to?

113
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,457
-So how's your job, Julie?
-Oh, it's. . .

114
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,667
-I can only imagine. Heartbreaking.
-So sad.

115
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,586
-Painful.
-Not in a bad way.

116
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,756
-Excuse me. Oh, God, I forgot.
-Excuse me.

117
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,632
-Hello?
-Hello?

118
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,759
-Hi.
-Hi.

119
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,804
Hey, Jules? I have got to interview you
for this piece that I'm writing.

120
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,599
Sure, Annabelle, great. I'd be honored.

121
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,185
Call Julie about interview.

122
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,980
Find out about dry cleaning.
Find out before dinner on Thursday.

123
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,565
Saturday party.

124
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,360
No.

125
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,738
I cannot computer-coach you every day
while I'm with my girlfriends.

126
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,115
What is it about? The article?

127
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:44,286
It's about our generation turning 30.

128
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:50,459
People turning 30 . Oh, my life, I am so busy.

129
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,629
I don't know when I can fit you in.

130
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,467
May I remind you, I don't want to
see you, you want to see me?

131
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,761
Yeah. Would a breakfast work?

132
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,558
l believed her. What kind of idiot am l?

133
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,104
She said,
"It's about our generation turning 30."

134
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,648
What'd you expect?
Annabelle was always a liar.

135
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,110
"Julie Powell, once the editor of
the Amherst literary magazine,

136
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,862
"the one we all knew would be 'The One,'

137
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,366
"temped for eight years before giving up
on her novel,

138
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,577
"and now works in a cubicle
as a mid-level bureaucrat,

139
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,997
"attempting to deal with
the aftereffects of 9/11 ."

140
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:33,001
Oh, God, you memorized it? How pathetic.

141
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,962
She left so much out.

142
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,340
Anyway, the picture was good.

143
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,843
-I looked fat.
-Just your face.

144
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,393
I forgot to tell you.
Do you know what Annabelle's doing now?

145
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,312
-Sarah told me. A blog.
-Of what?

146
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,441
What do you mean "of what"?
A blog of Annabelle.

147
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,235
Of every thought
that passes through her brain.

148
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,530
Her stupid, vapid, insipid. . .

149
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,576
I could write a blog.

150
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,244
I have thoughts.

151
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,289
And you're a writer,
which is more than I can say for Annabelle.

152
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,749
-If only that were true.
-You wrote a novel.

153
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,378
HaIf a novel.
And no one wanted to publish it.

154
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,756
You're not a writer unless someone
publishes you.

155
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,594
See, that's what's so great about blogs.
You don't have to be published.

156
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:29,141
You can just go online,
press enter and there it is, out there.

157
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,226
What would I write a blog about?

158
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,061
You're an editor, tell me.

159
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,732
Why don't you write about
how much you love Queens?

160
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,235
A short blog.

161
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:46,074
You could write about your job.

162
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,412
If I wrote a blog about my job
and anyone at work ever read it. . .

163
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,081
-I mean, hello.
-This is good.

164
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,334
This is really good.

165
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,296
On top of which, the whole idea of writing
a blog is to get away from what I do all day.

166
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,966
The way that cooking is a way
that I get away from what I do all day.

167
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,302
So write a blog about cooking.

168
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,225
I'm not a real cook,
like Julia Child or Mario Batali.

169
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,102
Julia Child wasn't always Julia Child.

170
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,152
If I really wanted to learn to cook,

171
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,906
I could just cook my way through
Julia Child's cookbook.

172
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,950
I could blog about that.

173
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:32,329
I have a copy. I stole it from my mother
last time I was in Texas.

174
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,044
When I was eight, my father's boss came
to dinner and it was a really big deal,

175
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,797
and my mother made boeuf bourguignon.

176
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:46,635
But it wasn't just boeuf bourguignon.
It was Julia's boeuf bourguignon.

177
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:51,473
And it was like she was there,
like Julia was there in the room,

178
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:57,479
on our side like some great big good fairy.

179
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,275
And everything was going to be all right.

180
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,824
I'm gonna try to fIip this thing over now,

181
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,119
which is a rather daring thing to do.

182
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:13,954
She changed everything.

183
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:18,250
Before her, it was frozen food
and can openers and marshmallows.

184
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,335
Don't knock marshmallows.

185
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,213
When you fIip anything,

186
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,509
you've just got to have the courage
of your convictions.

187
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,555
Especially if it's a Loose sort of mass Like...

188
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,641
That didn't go very well.

189
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,310
But, you see, when I fIipped it,

190
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:40,022
-I didn't have the courage I needed...
-She's so adorable.

191
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,774
...the way I shouId've.

192
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,278
But you can aIways put it together.

193
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:51,241
And you're aIone in the kitchen.
Who's to see?

194
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,620
Pearls. The woman is wearing pearls
in the kitchen.

195
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,873
...you've just got to practice, Like the piano.

196
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,959
I'm Julia child.

197
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,669
Bon app¨¦tit.

198
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,547
-Bon app¨¦tit.
-Bon app¨¦tit.

199
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,342
Bon app¨¦tit.

200
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:12,971
Julia child is coauthor of the book
Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

201
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,065
Bon app¨¦tit.

202
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,696
"For the servantless American cook."
That's me, all right.

203
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,161
Okay, here's a problem.
I've never eaten an egg.

204
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,164
And I have a hyperacidic stomach.
We'll deal.

205
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,836
So I'll cook my way through
the Julia Child cookbook

206
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,630
and write a blog about it.

207
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,383
-But I'll probably need a deadline.
-Why?

208
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,302
Because otherwise it'll be like
everything else I do.

209
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,970
'Cause let's face it, I never finish anything.

210
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,098
-Hey.
-Well, it's true.

211
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,101
You know why I think it is?

212
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,186
-ADD.
-You have ADD?

213
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,314
Yes. That's why I'm so bad at housework.

214
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,692
Oh, is that it?

215
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,944
I'm just saying, a deadline would be good.

216
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,529
So a deadline. "l love deadlines.

217
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,032
"l love the sound they make
as they go whooshing past."

218
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,284
-Hitchhiker's Guide to the GaIaxy.
-I mean it.

219
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,996
-Okay, so a year, or so.
-A year?

220
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,709
This thing weighs like two pounds.

221
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:29,131
I have a full-time job. Sometimes
I don't get home until 8:00 or 9:00 and. . .

222
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,050
It's crazy. It's crazy.

223
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,095
-Is it crazy?
-Yes. Yes.

224
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,015
-Okay, you want to do Blog Z?
-Yes.

225
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,684
Blog Z it is.

226
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,146
Nobody here

227
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,692
but us servantless American cooks.

228
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:53,739
"Servantless American cooks."

229
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,991
-What do you think?
-Love it.

230
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,452
"Start blogging."

231
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,622
"The JuIie/Julia Project."

232
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,876
The Book,
Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

233
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,505
First edition, 1961 by Simone Beck,
Louisette Bertholle,

234
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,927
and, of course, Julia child, the woman
who taught America to cook and to eat.

235
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:20,056
It's 40 years Iater and no one can touch her.

236
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:26,146
The Challenge, 365 days, 524 recipes.

237
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,690
The Contender, JuIie Powell.

238
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,610
Government empIoyee by day,
renegade foodie by night.

239
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:35,113
Risking her marriage, her job,
and her cat's well-being,

240
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:38,200
she has signed on for
a deranged assignment.

241
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,869
How far it will go, no one can say.

242
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:10,649
Dear CharIie, we're settIed in finally,
and Julia Loves it here.

243
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,109
She wants to stay forever.

244
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,572
You know how famously grouchy
the French can be, dear brother.

245
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,908
Everyone here is so delightful.

246
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,829
But Julia brings out the best in a poIecat.

247
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,205
So charming.

248
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,084
So she thinks they're the most
wonderfuI peopIe in the worId.

249
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,838
I feel that I am French.

250
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,884
I just must be.

251
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,638
Well, you might be.

252
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:49,187
As for staying here forever,
I have to say, I wouIdn't mind it myseIf.

253
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,773
And I'm so glad that you came,

254
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,066
-I can't tell you.
-It was a very nice show.

255
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,943
-Thanks for coming.
-I enjoyed it.

256
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:59,531
-Paul, congratulations. Excellent exhibit.
-Thanks so much, Jack.

257
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,200
Jack Donovan, this is my wife, Julia.

258
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:07,956
-lt was such a wonderful exhibition, Paul.
-Thank you. Thank you.

259
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,544
-I am so proud of you.
-Oh, good.

260
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,797
French people eat French food !

261
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,969
-Every single day! I can't get over it.
-They do.

262
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,851
You know I love you so much,
I'm gonna let you take the first bite.

263
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,646
-That's so good.
-Before I even had. . . It's good, is it?

264
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,820
What should I do, do you think?

265
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,615
About what?

266
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:46,411
I don't really want to go back into
government work.

267
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,123
You know, but l. . .
Shouldn't I find something to do?

268
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,295
These wives don't do anything here.

269
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,924
-That's not me. It's just not me.
-I know.

270
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,219
l saw a notice on the bulletin board
at the embassy

271
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,014
for hat-making lessons.

272
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,019
You like hats.

273
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,563
I do, I do.

274
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,108
I do.

275
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,364
What is it that you really like to do?

276
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:24,866
Eat.

277
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,706
-It's what I like to do.
-I know, I know. I know. I know.

278
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,626
-And you are so good at it. Look at you !
-I am good at it.

279
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,128
-Now. How good you are.
-I'm growing in front of you.

280
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,353
l was thinking of taking bridge lessons.

281
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:59,776
-You like bridge.
-I do. I like the idea of bridge.

282
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:03,279
Four points for an ace,
three points for a king,

283
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,741
two points for a queen, one point for a jack.

284
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,994
And breast your cards.

285
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,915
Do you have any French cookbooks
in English?

286
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:18,211
-I'm afraid not.
-Gosh.

287
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,604
The salesperson. She. . .

288
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:44,571
Had no idea. . . Because, you see,
there is no French cookbook in English.

289
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,366
And all I have is this Joy of Cooking
by lrma Rombauer,

290
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:51,703
which is an excellent, excellent cookbook,
but it's not French.

291
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,414
So I did ask my friend Avis De Voto

292
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,459
to look around in the United States
to see if she could find. . .

293
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:05,967
Right. Right.

294
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:10,180
Gosh, I thought I was
speaking French to you !

295
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,232
Oh, my goodness!

296
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,986
What do we have here?

297
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,906
-It's a copy of. . .
-It's my memoirs.

298
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,367
Oh, look.

299
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,706
Oh, it's fantastic! But it's in French !

300
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,542
-You'll get there. You'll get there.
-Thank you, darling.

301
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,670
I know. I'm learning. I'm trying. I'm really. . .

302
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,173
Happy birthday to me.

303
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,634
Happy birthday.

304
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,681
-What can this mean?
-What?

305
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:02,690
-"Wash the thighs."
-No, "bathe." Bathe the thighs.

306
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,152
-Look, but then. . .
-Where?

307
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,072
"ln butter." I know that. But what is the. . .

308
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:13,034
"Bathe the thighs in butter
and then stuff the. . ."

309
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,119
What's that word?

310
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,121
-The hen !
-Right. Hen.

311
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:21,543
"Until she just can't take it anymore."

312
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,339
-lt doesn't say that.
-lt does.

313
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:31,302
I'll show you later in the dictionary.
I'll go through the whole recipe with you.

314
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:35,974
-Why don't I go to cooking school?
-Why don't you?

315
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,560
-I'm serious.
-So am l.

316
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,479
Oh, my God.

317
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,113
What if you hadn't fallen in love with me?

318
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,574
But I did.

319
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,789
Oh, gosh.

320
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,968
Yesterday was Tuesday, August 1 3th, 2002.

321
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,680
Day one. 364 days to go.

322
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,184
I cooked artichokes with hollandaise sauce

323
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:22,979
which is meIted butter that's been whipped
into a frenzy with egg yoIks

324
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,815
untiI it's died and gone to heaven.

325
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:29,944
And let me say this.
Is there anything better than butter?

326
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,738
Think it over.
Every time you taste something

327
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:36,159
that's deIicious beyond imagining,
and you say, "What is in this?"

328
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:39,454
The answer is aIways going to be "butter."

329
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:40,872
It's incredible.

330
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,707
It's been whisked into submission,
that's why.

331
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,711
The day there's a meteorite heading toward
the earth and we have 30 days to Iive,

332
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,380
I am going to spend it eating butter.

333
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,508
Here's my finaI word on the subject.

334
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,763
You can never have too much butter.

335
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,266
August 24th, day 1 1 .

336
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,228
Is this what you mean when you say, "Don't
crowd the mushrooms"? Is this a crowd?

337
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:07,398
353 days to go. A horribIe day at work.

338
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,609
An oId grandma who Iooked as if
she wouIdn't harm a fIy

339
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,153
called me a penciI-pushing capitaIist dupe.

340
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,865
But then I came home and cooked chicken
with cream, mushrooms and port,

341
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,825
and it was totaI bIiss.

342
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,452
Here's the big news.

343
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,747
I had been cooking mushrooms
the wrong way my entire Iife.

344
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,709
Don't crowd the mushrooms,
otherwise they won't brown.

345
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,337
Are you Iistening, whoever you are?

346
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,422
You're gonna love that one.

347
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,674
Day 22.

348
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,425
This one's really good with fig jam.

349
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,554
I got carried away in Dean & DeLuca Iast
night and spent haIf my take-home pay.

350
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,890
And the first thing I reaIized
when I got to the subway

351
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:43,268
with my groceries, a bag of cat Iitter,

352
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:47,939
a bottIe of oIive oiI I absoIuteIy couId not
Iive without, and a huge bunch of branches

353
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,651
was that the branches were
probabIy not a good idea.

354
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,111
Sorry.

355
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,155
They were sIapping foIks in the face
right and Ieff and I was sweating Like a pig.

356
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,577
Not surprising, since I've been way too busy
cooking fattening food to bother exercising.

357
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:06,207
And then I came home and got
a big vote of confidence from my mother.

358
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,377
Remind me again why you're doing this...

359
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,213
-Blog.
-Whatever it's called.

360
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,342
It's a regimen, Mom. Like doing sit-ups.

361
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:19,762
-Well, it's just adding pressure.
-What pressure?

362
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,807
You have a full-time job,
you have a husband,

363
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,810
and now you're gonna get sick
from bIogging.

364
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,230
-It's sort of like being in AA.
-What are you saying?

365
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,234
lt gives you something you have to do
every day, one day at a time.

366
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,236
How do you know this Iingo?

367
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,363
Honey, are you an aIcohoIic?

368
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,450
I'm saying it's good for me to have
short-term goals.

369
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:43,619
Well, that is silly. That is just pIain silly.

370
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,997
Who's reading this bIog?

371
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,124
People. People are reading it, I'm sure.

372
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,001
Well, it's something you decided to do,

373
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,296
and you can decide not to,
and not one singIe person's gonna mind.

374
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,923
No. Don't you get it? I just started.

375
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,218
I can't stop, I have to finish. It's all I've got.

376
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,472
Hello? Hello?

377
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,308
Stupid dead phone.

378
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,435
Hey, it's not all you got.

379
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,772
I know. I know. I didn't mean that.

380
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,526
Yesterday, I poached an egg.

381
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,362
It seemed Like the perfect thing to do

382
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:21,032
on perhaps the second worst workday
in recorded history.

383
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,409
Explain to me how you've never eaten
an egg in your whole life.

384
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,745
I've had eggs in, like, cakes.

385
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,499
Never had an "egg" egg.
l was a very willful child.

386
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,792
It's simmering.

387
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:35,129
I had this notion, God knows why,
that poaching eggs wouId be simpIe.

388
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,465
But I was deepIy wrong.

389
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,385
"lmmediately and gently push the white over
the yolk with a wooden spoon

390
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,221
"for two to three seconds." lmmediately.

391
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,478
Disgusting.

392
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,314
Oh, maybe the eggs aren't fresh.
Julia says the eggs have to be fresh.

393
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,941
They are fresh.

394
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:59,487
Okay. You don't have to bite my head off.
I'm just quoting Julia.

395
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:03,282
It took three of us, crammed into the
kitchen over a pot of simmering water,

396
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,701
but, eventually, we naiIed it.

397
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,495
-Hello.
-Welcome.

398
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,330
How cute is that?

399
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:15,044
And I ate my very first egg
of my whoIe Iife, ever, ever, ever.

400
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:21,008
l thought eggs were going to be greasy
and slimy, but it tastes like

401
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,637
cheese sauce. Yum.

402
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,473
Julia Child, you are so good.

403
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:28,933
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

404
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,561
And, may I say, excellent wine?

405
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,939
-Do you think Julia knows about you?
-I wish.

406
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:39,110
I have this fantasy that she comes for dinner
and I show her my new lemon zester.

407
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,987
We become very close.

408
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,199
The truth is, no one knows about me.

409
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:49,370
l feel like I'm just sending things
into this giant void.

410
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:53,416
Which reminds me. Annabelle's blog.
Have you read it lately?

411
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,542
Yes.

412
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,879
-It's sort of funny.
-Is it?

413
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:02,216
She's dating this rich guy who owns a plane.
His name's Lester.

414
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:07,847
And they do it in the air.
People love it. It's a huge hit.

415
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,976
What do you think it means
if you don't like your friends?

416
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,520
-It's completely normal.
-Men like their friends.

417
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,982
We're not talking about men.
Who's talking about men?

418
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:23,738
So it's five weeks down, 47 to go,
and I feeI fantastic.

419
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:28,868
Sometimes, I can't heIp but wonder.
Is there anyone out there reading me?

420
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,121
But I'm sure you are,
aren't you? Somebody?

421
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,457
Anybody?

422
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,211
Ernestine, I have a comment.

423
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,303
My mother. Doesn't count.

424
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:56,395
Today we will begin by learning to boil eggs.

425
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:02,485
First, you must make sure
that the egg is fresh.

426
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,696
l was so hoping that. . .

427
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:10,743
Well, for something a little more advanced,
Madame Brassart.

428
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,455
But you are not an advanced cook.

429
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,667
But I do know how to boil an egg.

430
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,128
Do you know how to bone a duck?

431
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,882
No, but that's exactly the sort of thing

432
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:28,636
that I'm very interested
in learning how to do.

433
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:35,518
There is one other class,
but you will not like it.

434
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:40,356
It's for professionneI,
which you will never be, I'm sure.

435
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,818
All men. All Gls.

436
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,362
And very expensive.

437
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:50,241
I cannot imagine
that you would ever want to pay the tuition.

438
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,076
How much?

439
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,955
So the onion is ready, but. . .

440
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,772
You must hold the knife,
first of all, like this.

441
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,233
Wrist, easy. Leave the thumb here.

442
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,695
The hand and the knife are one.

443
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,990
And the hand, the other hand,
you must protect it.

444
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,909
Here, you must cut only the onion. Yes?

445
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,120
-Not me.
-Yes.

446
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,915
And then, you put your thumb here
and the other fingers here.

447
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:52,511
Jule?

448
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,598
You're being a little over-competitive,
don't you think?

449
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,976
Well, you should've seen the way
those men looked at me.

450
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:04,899
As if I were some frivolous housewife,
just looking for a way to kill time.

451
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,069
Well. . .

452
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,741
-Where are you going?
-Not here.

453
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,077
-You hungry?
-No.

454
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,205
Good.

455
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,127
Ta-da!

456
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,694
WelI done, Madame Child.

457
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:57,952
Dear Avis,
I'm in my third week at Le Cordon BIeu,

458
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,246
and I'm in utter bIiss.

459
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:05,000
Every morning the aIarm goes off at 6:30,
and I Ieap out of bed.

460
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,293
I'm up!

461
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:12,133
By 7:30 I'm in cIass, in my apron,
peeIing potatoes.

462
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:16,345
Then we cook stock and we bone fish.

463
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:21,308
We dress pigeons.
We make pastry with so much butter,

464
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,770
it aImost stops your heart just to Iook at it.

465
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:29,233
My teacher moves so quickIy
I'm sometimes Iost.

466
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:33,195
But I'm way ahead of the others in the cIass,
all of them men,

467
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,326
and all of them very unfriendIy,
untiI they discovered I was fearIess.

468
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,997
Something I reaIized
about the same time they did.

469
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:49,837
Morning cIass ends at 1 2:30,
then I go home and make Iunch for PauI.

470
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,510
Then PauI takes a nap.

471
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:03,684
And Iater in the affernoon, he goes back
to the embassy and I go back to schooI.

472
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:09,190
You must have a mortar and pestle.

473
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:14,236
Incidentally, my father is horrified
I'm going to cooking schooI.

474
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:17,364
Offered to give me extra money
to hire a cook.

475
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,287
Go on. Fun ! Joy! This is what matters.

476
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,956
I'm probabIy the onIy American I know
in Paris

477
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:31,170
who thinks shopping for food
is as much fun as buying a dress.

478
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,464
Course, you'd think so too,
if you Iived in a country

479
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,843
where absoIuteIy nothing comes in my size.

480
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:42,598
By the way, did you know
that if you don't dry meat,

481
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,100
it won't brown properIy?

482
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:51,398
Irma Rombauer doesn't say a word about it
in the Joy of Cooking.

483
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,736
Avis, I am in heaven here.

484
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:59,073
I've been Iooking for a career all my Iife...

485
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,660
-Happy Valentine's Day.
-...and I've found it.

486
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,872
We met in Ceylon when we were in the OSS.

487
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:09,375
But he never noticed me at first.

488
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,253
Well, that's not true. I noticed you.
l noticed your legs straightaway.

489
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,505
Oh, you were such a rou¨¦.

490
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,968
-All the women were mad for him.
-Can you blame them?

491
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,595
Anyway, we were sent off to China.

492
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,850
Absolutely delicious, if I do say so myself.

493
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,226
Julia.

494
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,687
When you finish your term,
you'll be teaching at Cordon Bleu.

495
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,605
No, I don't think so.

496
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:35,359
The woman who runs it absolutely hates me!

497
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,362
Come on.
Oh, no one could possibly hate you.

498
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,865
That's true. But she does.

499
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,491
Were you spies?

500
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:47,288
No. Yes. No.

501
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,291
Oh, so cagey, right?

502
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:56,005
You were in the Office of Strategic Services
and you were not spies?

503
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,632
l was only a file clerk.

504
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:04,597
But Paul? Paul designed all of the secret
war rooms for General Mountbatten.

505
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,141
Well, just maps and exhibits and things.
lt wasn't. . .

506
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,603
He did !
He single-handedly won the war for us.

507
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:14,773
Well, I had to. Someone did.
I mean, it was dragging on, wasn't it?

508
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:19,236
Anyway, so there we were in China,
just friends having dinner,

509
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,659
and it turned out to be Julia.

510
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,622
lt turned out to be Julia all along.

511
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:38,172
Julia, you are the butter to my bread,
and the breath to my life.

512
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,674
l love you, darling girl.

513
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,677
Happy Valentine's Day.

514
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,477
Dear CharIie,

515
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:55,105
Julia in front of her stove
has the same fascination for me

516
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,108
as watching a kettIe drummer
at the symphony.

517
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,612
The oven door opens and shuts so fast,

518
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:06,533
you hardIy notice the deff thrust of a spoon
as she dips into a casseroIe,

519
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,619
and up to her mouth for a taste check

520
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,872
Like a perfectIy-timed doubIe beat
on the drums.

521
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,208
Then with her bare fingers,

522
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,587
she snatches a set of cannelloni
out of the pot of boiIing water,

523
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:19,922
and she cries,

524
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:23,050
"These damn things
are as hot as a stiff cock."

525
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,095
-She said what?
-I know.

526
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:29,765
-Julia Child said, "Hot as a. . ."
-I know, I'm shocked.

527
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:35,562
It's from a letter that Paul Child
wrote to his twin brother Charlie in 1 949 ,

528
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,898
when Julia was just starting classes
at Le Cordon Bleu.

529
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:41,110
So Julia and Paul, beaucoup, beaucoup.

530
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:44,363
-I know. Just goes to show you.
-What?

531
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,491
You can never tell about
a person's sex life by looking at them.

532
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,368
They were so in love.

533
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,666
Hot sauce from a reader.

534
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:00,254
And today I had 1 2 comments from readers,
and I didn't know any of them.

535
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,550
Thanks to all my faithfuI readers
for this Ioot.

536
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:08,345
I have now completed 65 recipes in 47 days.

537
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:18,397
On track with 1 03 recipes
in just over two months.

538
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,523
Looks like a cupcake.

539
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,859
Lobster thermidor is coming up,

540
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:26,280
and I am going to have to murder
and dismember a crustacean.

541
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,615
How will I ever do this?

542
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,702
Last night our sIeep machine,
the one we have by our bed

543
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,039
to drown out the noise of freight trucks
rumbIing past our apartment,

544
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,875
was speaking to me. And it was saying,

545
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,543
"Lobster killer.

546
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,338
"Lobster killer, lobster killer, lobster killer."

547
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,218
One of my readers said
that if you put lobsters in the freezer,

548
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,179
it sort of numbs them.

549
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,897
Then I got another comment that said,
"Man up, kill the damn lobster.

550
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,232
"Just take a knife and do it."

551
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,114
It's alive!

552
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,407
Eric.

553
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,081
Oh, God.

554
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,168
"A note on dealing with live lobsters.

555
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:25,005
"If you object to steaming
a live lobster," yes,

556
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,051
"plunge the point of the knife
into the head between the eyes."

557
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:33,388
Oh, Julia, you make it sound so simple.

558
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,057
Lobster killer.

559
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,186
Eric.

560
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,021
Get out of here.

561
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:44,441
I don't need you at all.
You are completely useless.

562
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:48,779
I'm just gonna throw them into the water

563
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,157
and put the lid on and that will be that.

564
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,493
Fine.

565
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,331
Hello.

566
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,416
Goodbye.

567
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:11,510
I'm sorry.

568
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,903
You okay?

569
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,240
Okay.

570
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,244
Okay. All right.

571
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,372
All right, boys.

572
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,208
There's a new sheriff in town.

573
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:50,799
Lobster killer.

574
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,557
Under control.

575
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,559
You are a saint.

576
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,563
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

577
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,773
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

578
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,695
-I can't. I can't.
-You can.

579
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,906
-No, I can't. I have a lot to do.
-You can.

580
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,115
-Eric, I can't.
-I'm good.

581
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,283
-Eric.
-Just give me one more, give me one more.

582
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,953
-Just one more.
-Fine. Go, I have so much to do. Get!

583
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,288
Out!

584
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,211
-Hey, thank you so much.
-Hey, man. How you doing?

585
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,378
Happy birthday.

586
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:29,630
Yeah, terrific. Good to see you.

587
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,090
-Cake.
-Cake. Brother-in-law.

588
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:33,884
-Love you so much.
-Hey, man.

589
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,427
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

590
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,680
Bon app¨¦tit.

591
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,642
Happy birthday, Julie.

592
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,769
-Happy birthday.
-Hi ! Thanks, sweetheart.

593
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,897
Oh, thanks for coming all out here. Hey, you.

594
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,235
Here's an incredible thing.
When Julia and Paul met, she was a virgin.

595
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,694
-Really?
-Wow .

596
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,155
She was, like, practically 40 .

597
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,324
-You serious?
-How does anyone even know that?

598
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,494
There were all these letters that Julia
wrote to her friend Avis De Voto.

599
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,289
And Paul wrote to his brother, and no
one threw anything out, as far as I can tell.

600
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:07,417
When they got married,
she could barely boil an egg.

601
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,710
lsn't that amazing?

602
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,003
Really?

603
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,466
-Braised cucumbers are a revelation.
-This is good.

604
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,135
I'm obsessed with her. I'm totally obsessed.

605
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,470
She's totally obsessed.

606
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,847
Well, it's good that you are,
because this is amazing.

607
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,474
Seriously. So good.

608
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:26,270
Well, savor it, because that's all there is.
I mean, lobster, major bucks.

609
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:29,356
Why don't you put a PayPal thing
on the website?

610
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,275
People could send in money
if they felt like it.

611
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,277
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

612
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,279
You have fans, your readers love you.

613
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,115
I do? I have fans?

614
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,950
Yeah, you do.

615
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,996
-Well, I can't ask them for money.
-Why not?

616
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,917
l think you should do the PayPal thing.
That way we could have more lobster.

617
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:54,131
-Harder. Get them. Get them. Hey, hey, hey!
-Thirty. Thirty. Thirty. Thirty. Thirty.

618
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,511
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

619
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,181
Thank you.

620
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,238
Just like Julia's.

621
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,744
Only hers were probably the real deal.

622
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,246
They're beautiful.

623
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,081
Help you put it on.

624
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,004
Let's give this a shot here.

625
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,218
How's that?

626
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:42,637
Yeah.

627
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,140
I'm 30.

628
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,769
l thought it was gonna be terrible,

629
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:53,482
but thanks to you, and thanks to Julia,

630
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:56,109
it feels like I'm gonna get through.

631
00:44:58,446 --> 00:44:59,654
Cake.

632
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,908
More cake. How do you like that cake?

633
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,291
Hey, you.

634
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:15,420
I'm going to bed.

635
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,472
Ernie, 53 comments on my lobster blog.

636
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,807
Shut up.

637
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,436
-Julie Powell.
-This the person I speak to

638
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:32,562
if I got a probIem?

639
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,897
Yes, sir. What is your problem?

640
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,525
Too much food, not enough sex.

641
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,111
Eric, that's not funny.

642
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,530
I thought it was pretty funny.

643
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,073
Okay, it was.

644
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,741
-Hey, guess what?
-What?

645
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:48,703
You are the third most
popular blog on salon.com.

646
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,456
-I am?
-Yes, you are.

647
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:52,707
l am !

648
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,253
So I figure for every one who writes in,

649
00:45:56,337 --> 00:46:00,340
there are, I don't know, hundreds that don't.
Don't you think?

650
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:05,262
It's like there's this whole group of people
who are sort of connected to me.

651
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,432
They need me in some way.

652
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,853
Like, if I didn't write,
they would really be upset.

653
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:18,233
They'd probably take, like, poison,
try to kill themselves.

654
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,181
Julia.

655
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,600
Are you still making hats?

656
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:54,227
Oh, no, I abandoned it.

657
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:58,773
But I am ready to graduate
from the Cordon Bleu.

658
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:03,570
I can't get the damn woman
who runs the school to schedule the test.

659
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:07,407
Madame Brassart?
Is that the woman you are speaking of?

660
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,409
She is a bitch.

661
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,454
She is, you're right.

662
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:18,001
l think she's almost the only person
in the world I honestly can't stand.

663
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:22,839
She is not the only person I can't stand.

664
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,091
Do you two know each other?

665
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:28,011
You should. Julia Child, Simone Beck.

666
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,847
-Simca.
-Simca, how do you do?

667
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:34,601
And this is my friend Louisette Bertholle.

668
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:39,022
I can't believe you haven't met.

669
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,067
Simca and Louisette are writing a cookbook.

670
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,445
-For Americans.
-Really?

671
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:48,740
Why do you need to take a stupid test?

672
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:52,577
So I can get a diploma. So I can teach.

673
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,789
You don't need a diploma to teach.

674
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,832
You're probably right.

675
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,710
-Avis says the same thing.
-Who is Avis?

676
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:04,798
My friend, Avis De Voto,
who lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

677
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,883
She's very wise.

678
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:11,346
But I can't help it. I want a diploma.

679
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:15,141
l am very conventional.

680
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,814
I don't know what to do.

681
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:26,570
Well, why don't you write
to the horrible Madame Brassart

682
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:27,946
and threaten her?

683
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,614
Threaten her? With what?

684
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:31,950
The United States of America.

685
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,243
Yes!

686
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,329
Tell her the American ambassador
personally wants you

687
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,331
to take the examination.

688
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

689
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:43,086
l couldn't do that. Heavens, no!

690
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,881
The American ambassador.
Hardly even know the man.

691
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,925
Of course you can.

692
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,094
Dear Madame Brassart,

693
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:54,180
everyone at the American embassy,

694
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:57,851
incIuding my dear friend the ambassador,

695
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:03,607
will be very surprised if I'm not allowed
to take my examination.

696
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,859
You will write the recipes

697
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:09,529
for oeufs mollets.
Cotelettes de veau en surprise,

698
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:12,032
et cr¨ºme renvers¨¦e au carameI.

699
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:18,246
Cotelettes de veau en surprise.

700
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:24,544
l had no idea
what veal en surprise was. None.

701
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:29,966
Cooked it in class.
It's a veal chop with mushrooms in a bag.

702
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:33,219
A paper bag. That's the surprise.

703
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,597
You open the bag, surprise!

704
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:42,228
Veal and mushrooms, it's just
I've never flunked a test in my entire life.

705
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:47,233
-I am an A student.
-You can ask to take it again.

706
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,907
-I can?
-Of course.

707
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,077
Meanwhile, you can come teach with us.

708
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,622
Gosh !

709
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:04,751
Is it true you plan to teach?

710
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,421
Yes, we're going to teach
Americans in Paris how to cook.

711
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:14,928
Madame Child, I must tell you,
you have no real talent for cooking.

712
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:20,392
But the Americans
will never know the difference.

713
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:35,240
We are, I am sorry to say, entering aspics.

714
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,869
An aspic is sort of a beef-fIavored
Jell-O moId.

715
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,621
Doesn't that sound deIicious?

716
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,708
I can't imagine
why no one makes them anymore.

717
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,292
You begin with a caIf's foot,

718
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,546
which I am in possession of
thanks to my sainted husband,

719
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:53,550
and you boiI it untiI
your kitchen smells Like a tannery.

720
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:58,388
And then it geIs in the refrigerator
and you fIip it onto a pIate.

721
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:01,725
Which, according to Julia child,
is supposed to be easy.

722
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:06,062
And all I can say about that,
no offense intended, JuIia, is

723
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,064
the bitch Iied.

724
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:10,817
Shit.

725
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,865
-Shit!
-How many more aspics are there?

726
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,575
Seven.

727
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,536
No one wilI know if you don't do them.

728
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,748
It's not like there's, like,
the Aspic Police or something.

729
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,291
You could lie.

730
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,626
I can't. I just can't.

731
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:32,756
Julia wilI know. It's like she's watching me.
I'm under her influence.

732
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,009
I'm becoming a much better person
because of her.

733
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:39,053
Yuck! The sink! Look at this!

734
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:45,393
l hate it here!
Did you put something down the sink?

735
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,436
You hate it here?

736
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,773
How am I supposed to cook anything
in this kitchen?

737
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:54,152
It's no wonder that my mold fell apart.
I don't suppose we have any Drano.

738
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,237
Not unless you bought it.

739
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,449
I do all of this
and I'm supposed to buy Drano, too?

740
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,369
Right now, you are so
not under the influence of Julia Child.

741
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:11,628
What if I don't make my deadline, Eric?
I'lI have wasted a whole year of my life.

742
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:14,923
l used to be thin and now I'm getting fat.

743
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,216
-Fat?
-On top of which,

744
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,801
I have to bone a whole duck.

745
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,969
-When?
-At some point.

746
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:23,223
-Can you even conceive of boning a duck?
-No, I can't.

747
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,099
Of course you can't.

748
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,606
I'm sure you all remember,
because it was onIy a few days ago,

749
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,067
that I had a meItdown over my aspic

750
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,821
and vowed to transform myseIf
into a better human being.

751
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,867
And then I was trussing
the poulet r?ti ¨¤ la normande,

752
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:46,579
which is roast chicken stuffed with
chicken Iivers and cream cheese,

753
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:51,125
and it fell on the fIoor and the stuffing
fell out into a big gooey mess.

754
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,296
So, Iong story short, another meItdown.

755
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,881
This is crazy.

756
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:58,675
Worse than the Iast.

757
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:03,263
I can't even truss.

758
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:07,851
And I cried Like a small,
emotionally disturbed child.

759
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,270
I'm a mess.

760
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,486
l got it. I got it.

761
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,697
Hello?

762
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,158
Yeah, who's this?

763
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:28,371
Can you hold on just one second?

764
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:32,292
I'm not sure if she's here.
She might've stepped out. Hold on.

765
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:42,051
Hey, it's a reporter from
The Christian Science Monitor.

766
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,262
He wants to write about you.

767
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,224
He does?

768
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:51,394
l should tell him to call back, right?

769
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,688
No, no, I'll take it.

770
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,819
Hello?

771
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,572
Yes?

772
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,075
You want to bring who to dinner?

773
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:11,080
No, of course, I know who that is.
I know exactly who that is.

774
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,832
Who? Who, who, who, who?

775
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:17,253
That would be great,
that would be completely amazing.

776
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:18,630
Goodbye.

777
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,508
-Who?
-Guess who's coming to dinner?

778
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,594
Oh, my God.

779
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,514
To Les Trois Gourmandes.

780
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,017
One for all and all for one.

781
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:33,186
Yes!

782
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:37,315
All right. I had such a horrible time

783
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:41,778
converting these recipes
from the metric system.

784
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,698
-Measurements do not matter.
-Oh, but they do!

785
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,118
They absolutely do.

786
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,620
This is one of the biggest arguments

787
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,122
Louisette and I had
when we worked on our cookbook.

788
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,208
Which is finally finished.

789
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:59,629
Sent off to the publisher.
Soon Simca and I will be famous.

790
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,465
We'll be the next Mrs. Joy of Cooking.

791
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:07,553
Maybe. All right. Well, let's try.
Let's just give it a. . .

792
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,223
Can I help?

793
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,522
Yeah. lt is mieux.

794
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:24,779
So, yes. They're early. Americans!

795
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:30,743
Dear Dorothy,
your sister, JuIia, is now a cooking teacher.

796
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:35,081
We have three students who pay $2 a cIass.

797
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,751
BareIy enough to cover the cost of the food,
but who cares?

798
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:43,798
Simca, Louisette, and I
are Les Trois Gourmandes.

799
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:47,343
AIthough sometimes we are onIy
Les Deux Gourmandes

800
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:50,930
because Louisette
turns out to have headaches

801
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:55,560
and doctor's appointments
she scheduIes during cIass.

802
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,687
I have a little headache.

803
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:02,567
You'll meet them both
when you come here next month,

804
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:06,362
unIess, of course,
Louisette is having a stomachache.

805
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:11,993
Perfection.
And even if it isn't, never apologize.

806
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:15,329
No excuses! No explanations.

807
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,292
Louisette abandoned us,
another stomachache.

808
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,877
And the day before that,

809
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:25,548
she left class before we even finished
making the chocolate Bavarian cream.

810
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:30,636
I can't believe that's the only time
her dentist could see her.

811
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,097
Keep an eye out,
we don't want to miss Dorothy.

812
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:35,558
It's impossible to miss your sister.

813
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,147
I don't see her!

814
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,486
-There she is.
-Dorothy!

815
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:54,660
Hi, Julia! I missed you !

816
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,079
So good to see. . .

817
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,081
-Paul !
-Hi. Hi, sweetie.

818
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,876
I've had an adventure on the ocean liner!

819
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,088
-I didn't get sick once!
-Good girl ! How about your legs?

820
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:08,341
People were dropping like flies
all around me!

821
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,679
-Look.
-Oh, my goodness.

822
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,431
Look at that.

823
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:23,564
All I think about all day is food
and then I dream about it all night.

824
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:26,317
lt is true, she's obsessed.

825
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,070
If I didn't sit in the kitchen, I'd never see her.

826
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:34,158
Last week, I dreamed that
l made cassoulet for Dad,

827
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,120
and he hated it, of course.

828
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,622
He doesn't understand any of this.

829
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,541
l almost feel sorry for him.

830
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,710
He wanted so much
for us to stay in Pasadena,

831
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:47,630
marry Republicans, and breed like rabbits.

832
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,675
-Why didn't we?
-Too tall.

833
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,468
Let's face it, it's true.

834
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:55,304
From the beginning,
you just don't fit in. Literally.

835
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,182
-So then you don't.
-I know, it's true.

836
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:01,310
Do not bait Father about politics
when he comes.

837
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:03,813
-No.
-Or he won't pick up the check.

838
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,941
-He won't, will he?
-I can't make any promises.

839
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,986
-He loves Senator McCarthy.
-Oh, I know.

840
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,237
-Pasadena.
-Pasadena.

841
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,405
Jinx.

842
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,248
Dort, do you have. . . You have the Brie.

843
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,958
-Is this the Brie?
-Yes. Yes, that's the Brie.

844
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,044
Is that not the most wonderful cheese
you ever had in your life?

845
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,963
-Yes!
-Yes.

846
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,715
The answer's yes.

847
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:40,224
l got the chef at Chez la M¨¨re Michel
to give me the recipe for beurre blanc.

848
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:42,643
Beurre bIanc. What's beurre bIanc?

849
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:46,397
-Butter in a white wine vinegar reduction.
-I love butter.

850
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,400
You whisk them together,

851
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:54,155
and the acid in the vinegar
works on the milk solids in the butter

852
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:57,366
so that the butter, instead of melting,
becomes this

853
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,536
creamy, light, frothy,

854
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:04,457
with kind of a fantastic subtle kind of. . .

855
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,292
Tangy.

856
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,878
lt has a tanginess.

857
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,880
Tanginess?

858
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:12,298
Yes.

859
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,800
Well, that's. . .

860
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:18,554
That's who I married.

861
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:21,224
Anyway,

862
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:25,978
you serve it on fish and it's splendid.
I'm going to make it for you.

863
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:27,772
-That'll be divine.
-Yeah.

864
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,358
And, Dort, we're going to throw you a party.

865
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,445
-Really?
-Very exciting.

866
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,740
By the way, there's a man
that I want to introduce you to.

867
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,575
I think you'll really. . .

868
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,910
He's. . .

869
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,329
Tall. He's very tall.

870
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,831
-Pardon?
-Tall. He's very.

871
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,209
-Extremely tall.
-I'm extremely tall.

872
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,879
-But he's even taller, so that's good.
-He is even taller.

873
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:53,005
Well, that's good.

874
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,518
All right.

875
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,396
Pretty good.

876
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:13,859
But not great.

877
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,377
Hello, ladies. Anybody want anything?

878
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:32,878
Yes.

879
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:35,631
Help yourself. The tapenade is marvelous.

880
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:37,550
Julia, there you are.

881
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,428
John !

882
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,513
There you are.

883
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,724
Now, where is this sister of yours?

884
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,976
She's right over there. Hi, John.

885
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,769
-Hi, Paul.
-There.

886
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,481
So we've told her a lot about you.

887
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,859
Well, I don't want to
interrupt her conversation.

888
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:58,446
With lvan Cousins? They just met.

889
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,074
I can't imagine Dorothy running off
with lvan Cousins.

890
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,323
Dearly beloved. . .

891
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,506
John, this is lovely.

892
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,384
I've never been to a wedding like this before.

893
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:02,927
Here, Julia.

894
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,972
-What a beautiful wedding.
-Thanks, Pops.

895
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:10,518
l am not enthusiastic about this marriage.

896
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:14,730
Well, you weren't very enthusiastic
about ours, either.

897
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:15,981
True.

898
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:20,194
How are things at the embassy, Paul?

899
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,656
Fine. Thank you, Phila. Thank you.

900
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:28,911
Well, not fine, really, because
they've cut our library allowance by 90%.

901
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,915
lt seems that Senator McCarthy
has very long arms.

902
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,418
Senator McCarthy is a man
who knows his mind.

903
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:38,754
l admire a man who knows his mind.

904
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:43,676
Well, we know lots of people in Washington
who have lost their jobs,

905
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,596
after years in government service,
for no reason whatsoever.

906
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:52,351
And Paul had to make a list of
every single book in the embassy library.

907
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:56,230
Surely you're not suggesting that
the French government is any better.

908
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,607
-And. . .
-Shall we dance?

909
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:00,526
Come on, dance with me.

910
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,944
Excuse us.

911
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,532
You said you didn't want to talk about it,
then you went and talked about it.

912
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,950
I know, I never learn.

913
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:51,368
Where's my big sprig?

914
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,207
Up here, whipping away.

915
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:00,961
And for dinner, mayonnaise?

916
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:07,343
-That's good.
-That is good, isn't it?

917
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:11,472
-Very. From your sister.
-I'm going to send this recipe to Avis.

918
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,599
I'm very excited about it.

919
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:18,270
-I think it's a breakthrough.
-Well, it tastes like it.

920
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:33,118
Dorothy is pregnant.

921
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,291
Paul.

922
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:45,089
lsn't that wonderful?

923
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,467
Yes.

924
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,977
Okay.

925
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,479
-I'm so happy.
-I know.

926
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,025
I know.

927
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:11,699
If you warm the bowl slightly
before you beat in the egg yolk,

928
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:13,659
it changes everything.

929
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:19,665
Foolproof mayonnaise. Absolutely foolproof.

930
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,753
l typed it up.

931
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:34,513
-You disagree?
-About the mayonnaise? Not at all.

932
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,807
I'm sure you're exactly right.

933
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:42,229
Scientific workability. That's my motto.

934
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,149
Julia.

935
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,860
We have a little problem.

936
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:51,822
-Our editor. . .
-For our cookbook.

937
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,325
. . .thinks our book is not in English.

938
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,535
But your book is in English.

939
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:59,330
They are giving it a rejection.

940
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:03,667
But they suggest that
if we are continuing with it,

941
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,796
we should get a collaborator
who could take what we have

942
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:10,591
and make it work for American cooks.

943
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:16,096
Would you do it, Julia?

944
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,892
Would I do it?

945
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,023
Yes.

946
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:34,239
We are now going to pIay a round of
"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner."

947
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:38,786
This Wednesday, I am going to be
pIaying host to a distinguished guest.

948
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,120
CIue number one.

949
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:44,500
The degree of separation
between Julia child and me

950
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:48,003
is about to shrink
by a factor of about a thousand.

951
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:49,129
A thousand.

952
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:53,300
In answer to your questions, no, it is not
Amanda Hesser ofThe New York Times

953
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:55,928
or Nigella Lawson, or Ina Garten.

954
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:58,263
But here's cIue number two,

955
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:01,225
i will be making boeuf bourguignon,

956
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:04,186
which was the first dish
our distinguished guest cooked

957
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,940
upon reading Mastering the Art
of French Cooking for the first time.

958
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,360
Boeuf bourguignon.
Julia Child's boeuf bourguignon.

959
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:16,240
Well, since no one guessed my mystery
guest, I'm going to have to tell you all.

960
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:19,284
It's Judith Jones,
the editor who's responsibIe

961
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,746
for getting JuIia's cookbook pubIished
way back when,

962
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:26,458
the woman who recognized history
in an onionskin manuscript.

963
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:29,753
She's oIder and probabIy not used to
eating at 1 0:00 at night,

964
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:34,299
which is why I'm being diIigent about this
and making the stew the night before.

965
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,135
And as I cook it,

966
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:40,139
I aImost feeI as if Julia and I
are communicating over space and time

967
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:42,766
on a deep, spirituaI, mysticaI IeveI.

968
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:46,645
AIthough, mostIy, I'm just taIking to myseIf.

969
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,774
-How long does it take to cook?
-Two and a haIf hours.

970
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:57,990
WeIcome.

971
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,701
I'm Julia child.

972
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:06,331
And today we're going to make
a holiday foast, or les f¨¨tes d'holiday.

973
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:11,253
And we're going to start with haIf-boned
chicken or poularde demi-d¨¦soss¨¦e.

974
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:16,967
Now, first, remove the Iiver and fry it up
with some onions for a IittIe snack

975
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:21,138
or perhaps a deIicious Iiverwurst
which you can spread on a cracker,

976
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:24,349
a Ritz cracker, a saItine.

977
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:25,934
Saltine.

978
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:29,605
Or if you have a pet, a cat or a dog,
they Love Iiver.

979
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,023
Save the Iiver.

980
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,609
-Save the liver.
-Save the liver.

981
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:34,818
Now, you pIace the chicken on its stomach

982
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:38,864
and cut aIong the backbone
to the pope's nose, Like so.

983
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,491
Crack!

984
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,411
Now I've done it,
I've cut the dickens out of my finger.

985
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:46,914
Well, I'm gIad, in a way, this happened.

986
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:50,626
You know, accidents do occur
from time to time in the kitchen.

987
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:53,879
We've never really discussed what to do.

988
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,673
First, you must stop the bIeeding.

989
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:02,012
The best way is with direct pressure
on the apron, Like so.

990
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,766
You want to raise your hand over your head.

991
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:10,229
I recommend naturaI coaguIants,
such as chicken Iiver.

992
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:13,899
Another reason not to throw away the Iiver.

993
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:18,904
Oh, God, it's throbbing!
A tourniquet, that's it.

994
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,781
Why are you all spinning?

995
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:24,618
Well, I think I'm going to go to sIeep now.
Bon app¨¦tit.

996
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:12,291
No, no, no!

997
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:28,557
Well, it's just a big, dry collection
of recipes.

998
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:31,059
It doesn't work at all.

999
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:35,355
I'm just gonna have to throw
most of it out and start all over again !

1000
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:39,818
This has got to be a cookbook

1001
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:44,656
that makes French cooking accessible
to Americans who do not have cooks.

1002
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:48,160
Who are servantless.

1003
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,496
Is that a word?

1004
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,291
Servantless.

1005
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:57,169
I think it is a word.

1006
01:10:58,338 --> 01:10:59,630
Julia?

1007
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:07,554
-What if we had to leave Paris?
-Why would we have to leave Paris?

1008
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:11,141
Because my assignment was for four years.

1009
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:14,061
So then we still have time.

1010
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,355
Eight months.

1011
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:23,111
And this cookbook is not something
you can finish in eight months.

1012
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:28,200
No. But two years seems possible.

1013
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:31,954
Julia.

1014
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:37,167
What if they transfer me someplace else?

1015
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:39,002
Would they do that?

1016
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:40,879
Yes.

1017
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,757
They don't really care about me.

1018
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:48,553
Paul. Of course they do.

1019
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:52,891
They don't, really.

1020
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,561
Well, if we can't stay in Paris,

1021
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:59,815
then I'll just mail the pages
to Louisette and Simca

1022
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:01,483
and they can mail them back to me.

1023
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:06,196
That's why they invented the mail system
and carbon paper and onionskin copies,

1024
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,241
or I can just jump on the train to Paris

1025
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:14,204
whenever the three of us
absolutely have to work together, you know.

1026
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:19,084
Or the two of us, actually, because as
we know, Louisette does next to nothing.

1027
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:23,755
But we would still be somewhere in Europe.

1028
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,674
Don't you think?

1029
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:30,637
It's very hard to say,
given the current political climate.

1030
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:36,393
Senator McCarthy
does not like people like us.

1031
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:39,271
Us? Why? What have we done?

1032
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:44,276
We haven't done anything.
That's not the point.

1033
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:49,698
The point is, we were in China.
And that's practically sufficient.

1034
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,950
Well, meanwhile, we're still here.

1035
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:54,661
-Yes, we are. You're right.
-Yes.

1036
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:57,164
Here's to the book.

1037
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:00,876
French Cooking for All!

1038
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:07,924
Or French Home Cooking.
Do you like that? Which one do you like?

1039
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:09,634
I like them both.

1040
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:16,975
Dear Avis, encIosed is part of our cookbook
from the chapter on sauces.

1041
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:20,812
Naturally, it must not be shown to anyone

1042
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:24,608
unIess you are sure they are not,
never have been,

1043
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:28,570
and won't have anything to do
with the pubIishing business.

1044
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:31,823
There are peopIe
who wouId Love nothing more

1045
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:35,285
than to steaI this hollandaise recipe.

1046
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:40,832
We're late! Do you suppose she'll be there?

1047
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:44,503
Louisette? Of course she'll be there.
It's at her house.

1048
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:47,339
l was making a little joke.

1049
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:51,468
-What's this about, anyway?
-Louisette wouldn't tell me.

1050
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:53,845
She said it was a surprise.

1051
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:58,100
Maybe she's dropping out of the project.
That would be heavenly.

1052
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,102
-Julia.
-Well, it would.

1053
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:10,320
My friends, this is lrma Rombauer.

1054
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:13,490
Mrs. Joy?

1055
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:18,578
The first edition of the Joy of Cooking
took me a year to write.

1056
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:22,749
Only a year? lncluding testing the recipes?

1057
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:28,296
Well, I didn't really test all the recipes.
There were so many of them.

1058
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:32,551
And then I found a publisher,
a small printer in St. Louis.

1059
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:35,011
How much money did he pay you?

1060
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:38,515
l paid him. $3,000 .

1061
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:42,185
-$3,000?
-A small fortune.

1062
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:46,606
But I had a little life insurance money
because my husband. . .

1063
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:50,318
-No!
-He killed himself?

1064
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:51,736
Yes.

1065
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:55,115
And I thought, "Well, what else am l
gonna do with the insurance money?"

1066
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,325
And then, the book began to sell

1067
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:01,246
and Bobbs-Merrill picked it up,
so now I had a real publisher.

1068
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,248
And they gave you some money?

1069
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:04,541
Absolutely not.

1070
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:08,170
They swindled me. They stole my copyright,

1071
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:11,339
and now there's a new edition,
and guess what?

1072
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:15,093
-What?
-The index is a complete calamity.

1073
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:20,056
If you're looking for City Chicken,
you're not gonna find it under "C ."

1074
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:21,349
Really?

1075
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:24,603
It's under "Drumsticks, Mock."

1076
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:27,272
No.

1077
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,984
All she wanted to talk about

1078
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:35,197
was how her publisher had cheated her

1079
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:38,491
out of thousands of dollars in royalties.

1080
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:40,911
lt just made me realize this. . .

1081
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:45,457
Not going to be simple,
this getting published business.

1082
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,626
This is from Avis, for you.

1083
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,218
Oh, my. Well.

1084
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:02,098
What does she say now?

1085
01:16:03,434 --> 01:16:06,603
Avis loves my sauce chapter.

1086
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,772
That's wonderful, darling.

1087
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:10,315
Oh, no.

1088
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:17,530
She showed it to someone.
Which I specifically asked her not to do.

1089
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:22,410
She showed it to an editor
at Houghton Mifflin in Boston,

1090
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:27,457
and the Boston editor showed it
to the head of publishing and. . .

1091
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:28,917
Paul ! Paul !

1092
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:32,045
Yes? What, what, what? What, what?

1093
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,381
They want to. . .

1094
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:37,300
They want to publish our book.

1095
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,719
That's great news!

1096
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:42,264
And they want to give us an advance.

1097
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,515
How much?

1098
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:47,644
-$250!
-No.

1099
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:51,523
And when the book is finished, $500 more!

1100
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,066
I'm so proud of you.

1101
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,527
The editor loves the book!

1102
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,198
She just loves it.

1103
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:08,081
"So with the smell of burned stew
still in the air,

1104
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:11,459
"l woke up dying of stomach cramps.

1105
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:13,003
"l called in sick."

1106
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,797
And went back to bed for several hours.

1107
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:19,634
Put it in. Put it in the blog in case
someone in your office reads it.

1108
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:23,221
And went back to bed for several hours.

1109
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:29,019
By noon, I was somehow abIe to
straighten myseIf up to a standing position.

1110
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:30,103
What are you making?

1111
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:33,148
Bought the ingredients for
boeuf bourguignon all over again.

1112
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:34,316
Boeuf bourguignon.

1113
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,151
Dragged myseIf home.

1114
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:39,529
And made another boeuf bourguignon.

1115
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:44,159
And for dessert, a raspberry Bavarian cream.

1116
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,829
By the end of the day, I feIt fine.

1117
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,664
I was cooking dinner for a Iegend,

1118
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:52,625
even though I'd never really heard of her
untiI a few months ago.

1119
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,420
Maybe she'll offer you a book contract.

1120
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:57,172
What if she does?

1121
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:02,093
I mean, what would that mean?
That would mean I might be a writer.

1122
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:06,097
How much money
do people make for books?

1123
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:09,601
Like an advance? I have no idea.

1124
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:12,479
-$1 00 ,000?
-Don't even say it.

1125
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,447
Hello?

1126
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:25,200
Hi.

1127
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:31,956
I know. I know, I know.
lt is here, too. Cats and dogs.

1128
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:41,049
I know.

1129
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,634
Well, thanks.

1130
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:44,552
Bye.

1131
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,140
So not coming.

1132
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:55,855
That was the guy
from The Christian Science Monitor.

1133
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:58,525
It's raining.

1134
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:02,779
And we live in Long lsland City
and she's, like, older.

1135
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,323
It's mortitying.

1136
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:08,660
But on the bright side, more stew for us.

1137
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,664
Just for once, could you not
look on the bright side?

1138
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:16,501
Yeah. Well, it's not the end of the world.

1139
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:23,258
l thought, I really did think, I just did.
l thought "book contract."

1140
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:25,468
Me, Judith Jones, happily ever after.

1141
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:27,804
And then we'd have a little money

1142
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:31,015
and we wouldn't live over a pizzeria
for the rest of our lives.

1143
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,892
How am I gonna explain this?

1144
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:37,147
My readers are gonna be really upset.
They were so into it.

1145
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:41,776
-Your readers are gonna be really upset.
-I never should've told everyone.

1146
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,528
They'll live.

1147
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:46,156
Somehow,

1148
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:51,035
your readers will live.

1149
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:56,166
-Is it bland?
-Not anymore.

1150
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:58,209
Thank you for telling me that.

1151
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:01,963
You almost let me feed Judith Jones
bland boeuf bourguignon.

1152
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,257
This is a nightmare.
l told everyone she was coming.

1153
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,717
They will survive.

1154
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,845
And when this year's over,
and I cannot wait until it is,

1155
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:12,474
your readers will somehow
get on with their lives.

1156
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:16,311
-And I won't, is that what you're saying?
-I don't know. I have no idea.

1157
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:19,022
I mean, what's gonna happen when
you're no longer the center of the universe?

1158
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:20,982
That's just great.

1159
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:24,777
l am finally totally engaged in something.

1160
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:26,821
Okay, maybe I'm being a little narcissistic.

1161
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:28,990
A little? On a scale of 1 0?

1162
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:33,453
Okay, a 9 .3. But what do you think a blog is?
It's me, me, me day after day.

1163
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,163
l thought it'd be fun. How stupid is that?

1164
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,499
lt just turns out to be a lot of
what you call "meltdowns,"

1165
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:38,625
but they don't feel like meltdowns.

1166
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:41,503
They feel like I'm living with
a totally self-absorbed person

1167
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:44,047
who writes this stuff
for a bunch of complete strangers.

1168
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:46,841
And it's supposed to be a big adventure,
but it's not.

1169
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:48,676
It's our life. It's our marriage.

1170
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:52,055
And, here, in this room, it doesn't
feel like an adventure, it feels like shit.

1171
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:54,057
-lt was your idea!
-I know, I'm so sorry.

1172
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:57,644
What the hell was I thinking?
And I'll tell you something else.

1173
01:20:57,728 --> 01:20:59,562
l am not a saint.

1174
01:20:59,647 --> 01:21:01,523
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not!

1175
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,274
-Yes, you are!
-No, I'm not!

1176
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:07,195
And it makes me feel like an asshole
every time you say it!

1177
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,531
And do not write about this in your blog.

1178
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:11,866
-About what?
-About this fight!

1179
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:15,537
I'm outta here.

1180
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:36,933
-You all right, Julia?
-Yes, fine.

1181
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,978
I'm perfectly fine.

1182
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:44,899
Dear Avis, we finished packing today,

1183
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:49,195
and tomorrow we Ieave beLoved Paris
for Marseilles.

1184
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:53,700
PauI has been appointed CuIturaI Affairs
Commissioner for the South of France.

1185
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:58,705
I'm having a hard time pretending to be
anything but devastated.

1186
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,666
I'm going to go buy some bread.

1187
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:06,838
The advantage of Marseilles is that
it won't have the distractions of Paris.

1188
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:10,508
So we'll be abIe to finish the book.

1189
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,261
AIthough not on deadIine.

1190
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:17,515
At Ieast we're still in France.

1191
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:25,315
Dear Avis, I don't know
what we've done to deserve it

1192
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:27,692
but here we are in Germany.

1193
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:32,405
Actually in a suburb of Bonn
called PIittersdorf on the Rhine,

1194
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:36,367
which sounds much more picturesque
than it is.

1195
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:40,413
By the way, there is no chance
we'll meet our new deadIine.

1196
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:43,916
We'll be at Ieast two more years.

1197
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:48,254
MeanwhiIe, PauI has been
called to Washington.

1198
01:22:48,339 --> 01:22:50,298
We have no idea why.

1199
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:54,344
Well, they're going to promote you, finally.
They have to.

1200
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:58,973
Well, I don't know why they have to call me
back to Washington to tell me that.

1201
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:01,476
They could just send a telex.
lt'd be a lot cheaper.

1202
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:04,687
Well, they're going to reassign you, then.

1203
01:23:04,772 --> 01:23:08,191
They'll ask you whether
you prefer Paris or Paris.

1204
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:14,489
It's a possibility.
It's not likely, but it is a possibility.

1205
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:16,783
And if they are moving us back to Paris,

1206
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:20,495
I can look for an apartment
when I'm there next week.

1207
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:23,456
Good idea, yes?

1208
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:27,001
l promise I'll call you the minute they tell me

1209
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:29,837
we're being transferred back to Paris,
all right?

1210
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:31,589
All right.

1211
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:33,883
-I know, darling. I know.
-I think it could happen.

1212
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:35,551
lt could happen, I know.

1213
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:36,844
Stay right there. That's perfect.

1214
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:38,680
-Say cheese, ducky.
-Move your hand.

1215
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:40,598
-Good. Great.
-Put your legs together, darling.

1216
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:42,850
It's very simple.

1217
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:46,771
We're just going to tell her she should have
a smaller share of the royalties

1218
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:53,027
because it is clear she can't put in the 40
hours a week you and I are spending on it.

1219
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:55,363
-Sixty is more like it. Eighty.
-Exactly.

1220
01:23:55,447 --> 01:24:01,494
-You and I are vaches enragees.
-That's exactly what we are. Mad cows.

1221
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:06,290
But I can't bring myself
to say this to Louisette.

1222
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:10,712
-You're going to have to do it.
-I wilI do it. We must be cold-blooded.

1223
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:13,965
l shall love her much more
when this is settled.

1224
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:20,555
lt isn't that you're not helping
to some extent.

1225
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,306
But I am helping.

1226
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:26,644
lt was my idea to add peas
to the coq au vin recipe.

1227
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:29,522
We know, and that was a wonderful idea,

1228
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:33,025
but the book has become a magnum opus.

1229
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:35,153
But we are a team.

1230
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:39,073
We are Les Trois Gourmandes. One for all.

1231
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:43,703
Yes, it's absolutely true, Louisette.
Yes, it's true.

1232
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:47,665
And you have been very valuable
to the project.

1233
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:48,916
Thank you.

1234
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:53,504
But. . .

1235
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:57,467
l am getting a divorce.

1236
01:24:58,177 --> 01:25:01,304
-What?
-Jean-Luc is leaving me.

1237
01:25:03,474 --> 01:25:09,854
I'm so sorry. Louisette.
Just forget that I even mentioned it.

1238
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:13,274
But it isn't fair for Louisette to get
the same amount of money that we do.

1239
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,777
Simca, this is not the time to discuss this.
She's getting a divorce.

1240
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:18,029
But she doesn't do the work.

1241
01:25:19,907 --> 01:25:23,284
You don't do the work,
so your share should be 1 0%.

1242
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:25,536
Ten percent?

1243
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,997
You're not doing the work.

1244
01:25:28,207 --> 01:25:29,665
Twenty-five.

1245
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,292
-Fifteen.
-Twenty.

1246
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:33,628
Eighteen and not a penny more.

1247
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:37,256
And where it says our names,
l think it should say,

1248
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:42,386
"By Julia Child and Simone Beck,
with Louisette Bertholle."

1249
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:45,890
-"With"?
-And in smaller type.

1250
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,558
No, no, no, no, Simca.

1251
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:52,522
Our names exactly the. . . Exactly. . .
And alphabetical. Alphabetical.

1252
01:25:57,069 --> 01:26:00,863
But it was not even her idea
to put the peas in the coq au vin.

1253
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:03,991
-No.
-But it bothers me.

1254
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:08,663
For me?

1255
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:14,836
Dear Avis, we've been through
our own version of Kafka.

1256
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:18,005
PauI went off to Washington,
and in my innocence

1257
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:21,259
I thought it must be because
the United States government

1258
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:24,554
had finally reaIized how vaIuabIe he was.

1259
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:29,016
Far from it. He was being investigated.

1260
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:33,938
He spent three days being grilled
in a windowIess room

1261
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:38,901
with a foot-high stack of papers
ominousIy sitting on the tabIe.

1262
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:42,280
They asked him about our friends,
our books,

1263
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:44,949
our China years, our patriotism.

1264
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:48,870
They even asked him
if he was a homosexuaI.

1265
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:51,831
-Are you a homosexual, Mr. Child?
-No.

1266
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,959
l am not a homosexual.

1267
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:57,795
This is not a joke.

1268
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:01,048
I'm well aware of that.

1269
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:06,304
He came home exonerated
but thoroughIy bruised.

1270
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,639
Julia, it was a nightmare.

1271
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:13,477
What am I going to do?

1272
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:16,981
l feel like my entire life has been a waste.

1273
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,234
-Paul.
-I have one more posting,

1274
01:27:21,445 --> 01:27:23,738
then I'll retire and then what?

1275
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:29,744
We'll figure it out.

1276
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:36,918
l just don't know what it was all for.

1277
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:40,171
You know?

1278
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,676
You at least have the book.

1279
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,512
Well, it's your book, too.

1280
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:50,473
lt is.

1281
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:54,894
Without you, it wouldn't be a book.

1282
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:58,689
Not that Simca and I'll ever be done with it.

1283
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:03,819
-Someday you'll be done with it.
-I'm beginning to wonder.

1284
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:23,464
So to wrap things up,

1285
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:27,510
at 6:22 Iast night,
guess who wasn't coming to dinner?

1286
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:29,595
That's right.

1287
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:33,265
It began pouring down rain
and Judith Jones canceIed.

1288
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:35,226
I was utterIy crushed.

1289
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:37,812
And then on top of everything,

1290
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:41,315
I had a horribIe fight with my husband
and he Ieff me.

1291
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:59,333
The boeuf bourguignon was delloicus,
not that I ate it.

1292
01:28:59,418 --> 01:29:03,629
As for the raspberry Bavarian cream,
I am taking it to the office.

1293
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:11,637
Morning.

1294
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:14,682
Julie, could you come in here?

1295
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:17,018
l didn't tell him, I swear.

1296
01:29:17,144 --> 01:29:18,310
Julie?

1297
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,901
-Feeling better?
-Much.

1298
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:31,157
So you burned the stew?

1299
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:35,453
But that's not why I didn't come to work.
l didn't come to work because I had. . .

1300
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:37,371
Stomach flu.

1301
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:39,248
Listen, it's a free country.

1302
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:44,462
But this little thing of yours on the lnternet,
I do not want to show up in it. Okay?

1303
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:48,299
And if you don't feel like coming in to work,
let me know.

1304
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:52,636
Somebody wilI want this job.
We're trying to do something here.

1305
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:56,015
I'm sorry.

1306
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:59,602
Anyone else would fire you.

1307
01:29:59,686 --> 01:30:01,812
A Republican would fire you.

1308
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:04,273
I'm not a schmuck.

1309
01:30:10,614 --> 01:30:13,657
I'm in shock. I can't believe it.

1310
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:18,162
You're like "The Ones." If you and Eric
can't make it work, who can?

1311
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:23,334
All sorts of people can.
Just not me because I am a bitch.

1312
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:26,170
l am, Sarah. I'm a bitch.

1313
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,340
I know. I know you are.

1314
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:32,927
By the way, Garth and I broke up.

1315
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:36,597
Oh, God, I didn't even ask.
l am a one-way street, just like Eric says.

1316
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:39,183
It's okay. I wasn't in love with him.

1317
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,602
Do you really think I'm a bitch?

1318
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,438
-Well, yeah.
-I know.

1319
01:30:44,523 --> 01:30:46,023
But who isn't?

1320
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:48,734
Julia.

1321
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,614
I've been thinking about me and JuIia.

1322
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:57,409
She was a secretary
for a government agency and I am, too.

1323
01:30:57,494 --> 01:31:01,872
A really nice guy married her.
A really nice guy married me.

1324
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:04,291
Both of us were Iost

1325
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:07,878
and both of us were saved
by food in some way or other.

1326
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:13,342
So major overIaps.
But let's face it, I am not Julia child.

1327
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:18,180
Julia child never Iost her temper
just because something boiIed over,

1328
01:31:18,265 --> 01:31:21,976
or collapsed in the oven,
or just pIain fell through.

1329
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:26,480
And she was never horribIe to her husband,
I'm sure.

1330
01:31:26,565 --> 01:31:28,983
And she never behaved Like,
"Who has time to be married?"

1331
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:32,570
Which is how I behave sometimes,
I'm sorry to say.

1332
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:36,991
I wish I were more Like her.
She deserved her husband and I don't.

1333
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:38,701
That's the truth.

1334
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:41,912
Well, anyway, that's the truth for now.

1335
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:43,497
Yogurt for dinner.

1336
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:12,443
Hi, you've reached Eric Powell at
Archaeology magazine. Leave a message.

1337
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:16,280
I hated sIeeping without you Iast night.

1338
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:18,657
Where are you?

1339
01:32:18,992 --> 01:32:20,367
l miss you.

1340
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:54,902
-Hello?
-Honey, is something wrong?

1341
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:57,154
No.

1342
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:00,157
Why would you think that?

1343
01:33:00,242 --> 01:33:02,743
Are you and Eric
having some kind of probIem?

1344
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:04,078
Of course not.

1345
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:06,997
-Is he there and you can't taIk?
-He's not here.

1346
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:11,043
I just read your bIog, and it was strange
and uncharacteristically thoughtfuI.

1347
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:12,836
-Where is he?
-Out.

1348
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:16,090
He went out to get pizza.

1349
01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:18,342
Have you stopped cooking?

1350
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:22,513
Just temporarily.
Just taking a little break from cooking.

1351
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:23,931
Well, get back to it.

1352
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:27,601
It's gonna be good for you to finish
something for once in your Iife.

1353
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:30,604
-Julia didn't give up.
-Who says I'm giving up?

1354
01:33:30,689 --> 01:33:33,399
Well, I'm just saying don't.

1355
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:22,948
Hey.

1356
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:27,077
Are you back?

1357
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:29,079
Please be back.

1358
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:32,833
What's for dinner?

1359
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:53,979
Well, Avis said she'd be here.
Even if we were late.

1360
01:34:54,064 --> 01:34:56,565
Well, if she's not here, we can take a taxi.

1361
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,817
They probably have taxis in Boston.

1362
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:02,738
She'll be here. Wearing a plaid jacket.

1363
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:06,158
That's how I'm to recognize her.

1364
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:10,079
What do you mean, "recognize her"?
Has she changed?

1365
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:14,708
Well. . .

1366
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:20,130
"Look for the middle-aged woman
in a plaid jacket."

1367
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:23,342
-So. . .
-You and Avis have never met?

1368
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:25,177
We're just pen pals.

1369
01:35:25,804 --> 01:35:27,554
You don't know each other?

1370
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:29,681
Well, we do. We write.

1371
01:35:29,766 --> 01:35:32,559
But how did you start writing one another?

1372
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:37,356
That's a long story.

1373
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:43,654
Avis' husband, Bernard De Voto, now dead,
was a wonderful, wonderful writer.

1374
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:49,326
He wrote an article in Harper's Magazine
all about stainless steel knives

1375
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:53,705
-and how he absolutely detested them.
-Yes.

1376
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:59,795
And so I wrote him a fan letter
because he was 1 00% right

1377
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:02,339
and Avis wrote me back.

1378
01:36:02,799 --> 01:36:05,843
And so I wrote her back.
And she wrote me back.

1379
01:36:07,053 --> 01:36:10,472
Well, it's been eight years, I think.

1380
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,445
-Avis.
-Julia.

1381
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:31,243
-My darling friend.
-Look at you.

1382
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:37,207
Brilliant friend. Bless you.

1383
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:43,464
This is a very impressive undertaking,
Mrs. Child and Mrs. Beck.

1384
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:45,883
Well, thank you very, very much.

1385
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:48,510
And your editor loves it.

1386
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:51,138
I do. I think it's brilliant.

1387
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:54,766
There's really nothing else like it
on the market.

1388
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:59,855
-The problem is not just the length.
-It's 700 pages.

1389
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:04,776
-Yes, we know. lt is long.
-Yes, we know it's long.

1390
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:10,282
You have 700 pages
of just sauce and poultry recipes.

1391
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:15,454
We were thinking that you could publish it
in a series of volumes.

1392
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:17,581
Volume One, Sauces.

1393
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,958
-Volume Two. . .
-Poultry.

1394
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:22,085
Yes.

1395
01:37:23,213 --> 01:37:29,176
Volume Three, Fish.
Meat, vegetables, and desserts.

1396
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:32,554
That's one, two, three. . . That's six volumes.

1397
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:34,431
Eggs.

1398
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:38,560
-Eggs.
-Eggs. Seven. Seven volumes.

1399
01:37:39,145 --> 01:37:42,231
But we don't want to publish
an encyclopedia.

1400
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:44,650
l thought this was intended for housewives.

1401
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:49,154
Yes, housewives want something quick,
with a mix.

1402
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:51,365
Like this.

1403
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:56,328
But if I may speak for everyone,

1404
01:37:56,412 --> 01:38:00,999
if you were willing to revise it,
I'm sure we would all be interested.

1405
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:08,131
Simca, I am so sorry.

1406
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:11,385
You just picked the wrong collaborator.

1407
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:16,306
Yes, I should have worked with this woman,
"Baked Alaska in a Flower Pot."

1408
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:22,271
We'll just take the book away from
Houghton Mifflin and find another publisher.

1409
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:27,693
We have just begun to fight.
Julia, your book is a masterpiece.

1410
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:29,736
What is Marshmallow Fluff?

1411
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:35,742
And keep the advance, by the way.
Keep the entire $250 .

1412
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:37,744
Don't give them back a penny of it.

1413
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:43,667
Why did we ever decide to do this anyway?
What were we thinking?

1414
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:45,377
Who can remember?

1415
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:47,838
I can.

1416
01:38:49,299 --> 01:38:54,553
We wanted to write a French cookbook
for American women who do not have cooks.

1417
01:38:54,637 --> 01:39:00,517
So then, that's what we'lI do.
We'll just do it all over again.

1418
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,854
And that's that. lt'll be easy.

1419
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:11,028
It will. The dessert section is done.
Thanks to Simca, it is brilliant.

1420
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:13,280
Thank you.

1421
01:39:13,615 --> 01:39:16,283
I just haven't typed it up yet.

1422
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:20,871
But that will give me something to do
in Oslo.

1423
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:56,073
Eric, come see
the world's most beautiful chicken.

1424
01:40:07,585 --> 01:40:08,794
Naughty.

1425
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:16,093
Wow .

1426
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:19,262
Oh, my God.

1427
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:25,477
lt feels so good. No, I'm serious. I love it!

1428
01:40:26,896 --> 01:40:29,731
l just want to savor this moment.

1429
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:32,150
The moment when anything is possible.

1430
01:40:32,235 --> 01:40:37,155
The moment that you can just imagine
they're going to love everything you did

1431
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:42,119
and it's going to sell a million copies
and change the world.

1432
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:46,915
Yes. But I think
it calls for a great bottle of wine.

1433
01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:48,750
-Don't you think?
-Yes.

1434
01:40:48,835 --> 01:40:50,502
What's for dinner?

1435
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:56,758
What if she doesn't eat pork?

1436
01:40:56,843 --> 01:41:01,430
She's a food writer. Of course she eats pork.
You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

1437
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:04,474
You're right. I know you're right.
I'm sure you're right.

1438
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:07,102
-ls she early?
-She's right on time.

1439
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:08,687
-I'll finish, I'll finish.
-Thank you, thank you.

1440
01:41:08,771 --> 01:41:12,816
You are a terrible human being.
And very difficult to live with.

1441
01:41:14,402 --> 01:41:15,485
Who is it?

1442
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:17,654
Amanda Hesser from The New York Times.

1443
01:41:18,573 --> 01:41:19,823
Come in.

1444
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:27,497
You have such a sense of Julia
when you do something like this,

1445
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:29,624
as a teacher, as a voice.

1446
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:32,919
I have conversations with her
while I'm cooking.

1447
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:36,506
And I feel like she is there with me
in the kitchen.

1448
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:38,425
She's like your imaginary friend.

1449
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:39,593
Yes.

1450
01:41:40,636 --> 01:41:42,763
And, of course,
she is the person I write for every day.

1451
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:45,515
Although, I don't think she ever reads it.
I don't know.

1452
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,476
I'm dying to meet her.

1453
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:51,646
I would like to be a bridesmaid
in her wedding in 1 946.

1454
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:56,693
I realize that that would take
an inexplicable episode of time travel,

1455
01:41:56,778 --> 01:41:59,613
but that is the sort of thing
that I think about.

1456
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:02,115
We're planning a pilgrimage
to Julia's Cambridge kitchen

1457
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,451
in the Smithsonian museum
when this is over.

1458
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:09,247
But first, I have to finish.
I have 15 days and 24 recipes,

1459
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:12,709
and I stilI have to bone a duck.

1460
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:20,550
I read somewhere that it was bad form
to say "yum" while you're eating, but "yum."

1461
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:48,703
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,
this is Julie Powell. Please hold.

1462
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:51,915
Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,
this is Julie Powell. Can you hold?

1463
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:53,291
-Yes.
-Great.

1464
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:55,669
-Lower Manhattan Development. . .
-JuIie, it's Sarah.

1465
01:42:55,753 --> 01:42:57,587
The Now York Times. I can't beIieve it!

1466
01:42:57,672 --> 01:43:00,799
I know. I know, I know, I know, I know.
Can I call you back?

1467
01:43:00,883 --> 01:43:02,592
I have to call you back. Hold on.

1468
01:43:02,677 --> 01:43:05,011
Hello, this is Julie Powell.
How can I help you?

1469
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:09,474
-Hi.
-Hey.

1470
01:43:10,852 --> 01:43:13,728
Guess what? Messages on machine?

1471
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:16,523
Sixty-five.

1472
01:43:16,941 --> 01:43:19,317
-Sixty-five?
-Sixty-five.

1473
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:28,368
If this is the JuIie Powell in this morning's
New York Times, this is Judy CIain.

1474
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:30,871

1485

And Aunt Jessie's cousin Dorrie in AbiIene,

1488
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,251
the one with the husband
who won the pie-eating contest

1489
01:44:18,336 --> 01:44:20,045
and is a crossword puzzIe nut,

1490

they have a subscription to
The New York Times. They saw it in AbiIene.

1491
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:26,092
Everyone is so excited!

1492
01:44:26,469 --> 01:44:28,887
This is Ken Dryer.
I'm an editor at Random House,

1493

1494

I'm an editor at Bon Appetit.

1495
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:37,604
Hi, I'm a producer at the Food Network.
We'd Love to meet with you.

1496
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,230
-TaIk to you.
-We have some ideas.

1497
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:41,399
I don't know whether you're thinking of
turning this into...

1498
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:42,442
-A book.
-A movie.

1499
01:44:42,526 --> 01:44:44,402

-Here you go.

-You make them better.
-I just make them stronger.

1509
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:15,725
Hi, it's Barry Ryan
from the Santa Barbara News-Press,

1510
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:18,979
and I'm writing an articIe about
Julia child's 90th birthday

1511
01:45:19,063 --> 01:45:20,855
and I asked her about your bIog,

1512
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:26,027
and, frankIy, she was kind of a pill about it
so I thought maybe you'd want to comment.

1513
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:27,946
Hello?

1514
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:29,739
Yes, it is.

1515
01:45:33,744 --> 01:45:35,245
She said that?

1516
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,456
Julia Child said that?

1517
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:44,421
Has she read my blog?

1518
01:45:48,426 --> 01:45:51,428
No, I don't really wanna comment.

1519
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,723
But thank you for calling.

1520
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,062
Julia hates me.

1521
01:46:06,444 --> 01:46:07,527
Jule?

1522
01:46:10,281 --> 01:46:11,740
They hate us.

1523
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:13,491
Who?

1524
01:46:14,326 --> 01:46:15,952
Houghton Mifflin.

1525
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:31,634
-They don't hate you.
-They do. They absolutely do.

1526
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:35,138
No, they say the book is good.

1527
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:37,182
But they don't want to publish it.

1528
01:46:37,266 --> 01:46:41,603
Well, they think it's too expensive.
They think it's "economically prohibitive."

1529
01:46:41,687 --> 01:46:47,984
Eight years of our lives
just turned out to be something for me to do

1530
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:51,988
so I wouldn't have nothing to do.

1531
01:46:53,449 --> 01:46:54,699
Oh, well.

1532
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:56,659
Boo-hoo.

1533
01:46:58,913 --> 01:47:00,163
Now what?

1534
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:04,626
-You're a teacher.
-Yeah.

1535
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:06,211
You can teach.

1536
01:47:07,421 --> 01:47:09,506
Right? We'll go home and. . .

1537
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:11,841
Where's home?

1538
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:14,177
Where do we live?

1539
01:47:18,808 --> 01:47:21,643
-Home is wherever we are.
-Yeah.

1540
01:47:22,144 --> 01:47:26,231
All right?
And we'll work it out. We'll figure it out.

1541
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:29,776
-You can teach in our kitchen.
-True.

1542
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:31,528
You can teach on television.

1543
01:47:35,157 --> 01:47:36,533
Television?

1544
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:38,201
-Me?
-Yes.

1545
01:47:38,911 --> 01:47:39,953
-Paul.
-No, Julia.

1546
01:47:40,037 --> 01:47:43,706
l think you would be excellent on television.
I do.

1547
01:47:44,542 --> 01:47:46,042
-Paul !
-I do. I do.

1548
01:47:46,127 --> 01:47:47,293
Don't. . .

1549
01:47:47,837 --> 01:47:50,046
I'm not kidding you. I'm not.

1550
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:53,842
Someone is going to publish your book.

1551
01:47:53,926 --> 01:47:57,804
Someone is going to read your book
and realize what you've done.

1552
01:47:57,888 --> 01:48:00,056
Because your book is amazing.

1553
01:48:00,141 --> 01:48:02,934
Your book is a work of genius.

1554
01:48:03,519 --> 01:48:06,646
Your book is going to change the world.

1555
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:10,733
Do you hear me?

1556
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:15,238
You are so sweet.

1557
01:48:17,408 --> 01:48:18,575
You are

1558
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:21,452
the sweetest man.

1559
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:27,375
Fuck them.

1560
01:48:32,756 --> 01:48:35,508
Judith, would you take a look at this?

1561
01:48:35,593 --> 01:48:37,927
Our intrepid literary scout, Avis De Voto,

1562
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:41,556
is friends with some woman
who's written a huge French cookbook.

1563
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,267
Houghton Mifflin just turned it down.

1564
01:48:44,894 --> 01:48:48,813
"French Recipes for American Cooks."
Terrible title.

1565
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:50,899
Have fun, Judith.

1566
01:49:24,892 --> 01:49:36,027
Yum.

1567
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:39,155
Oh, my.

1568
01:49:47,998 --> 01:49:51,251
-Here it is. Of course.
-What. . .

1569
01:49:52,002 --> 01:49:54,837
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

1570
01:49:59,051 --> 01:50:01,094
Special delivery for Mrs. Julia Child.

1571
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:02,470
Chilly!

1572
01:50:05,349 --> 01:50:06,891
There you are.

1573
01:50:33,961 --> 01:50:35,586
Dear Mrs. child,

1574
01:50:35,671 --> 01:50:38,172
we have read your superb French cookbook,

1575
01:50:38,257 --> 01:50:42,010
studying it, cooking from it,
estimating, and so on.

1576
01:50:42,094 --> 01:50:44,929
And we have come to the concIusion
that it is a unique book

1577
01:50:45,014 --> 01:50:47,348
that we wouId be very proud to pubIish.

1578
01:50:47,558 --> 01:50:49,434
Paul ! Paul !

1579
01:50:49,518 --> 01:50:51,728
What? What, what, what, what?

1580
01:50:52,563 --> 01:50:53,730
Knopf. . .

1581
01:50:54,106 --> 01:50:56,649
Knopf wants to publish our book.

1582
01:50:56,734 --> 01:50:58,735
Is it "K-nopf" or "Nopf"?

1583
01:50:59,236 --> 01:51:01,112
-Who cares?
-Who cares?

1584
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:05,658
They want to offer us an advance of $1 ,500 .

1585
01:51:05,743 --> 01:51:07,076
Oh, my God.

1586
01:51:08,203 --> 01:51:13,166
"We believe that your book wilI do
for French cooking in America

1587
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:17,170
"what Rombauer's the Joy of Cooking did
for standard cooking.

1588
01:51:17,254 --> 01:51:19,672
"And we will sell it that way."

1589
01:51:19,757 --> 01:51:21,090
Julia!

1590
01:51:22,551 --> 01:51:25,303
When we meet,
which I hope will be very soon,

1591
01:51:25,387 --> 01:51:28,848
I especially wanna taIk to you
about the titIe of the book.

1592
01:51:28,932 --> 01:51:32,477
Because it is of the utmost importance
that the titIe distinguish this book

1593
01:51:32,561 --> 01:51:35,146
from all the other cookbooks on the market.

1594
01:51:36,648 --> 01:51:40,818
-Is this the way you normally do this?
-Absolutely not.

1595
01:51:47,451 --> 01:51:50,703
"Mastering the Art of French Cooking."

1596
01:51:53,582 --> 01:51:54,624
What do you think?

1597
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:59,712
Well, at this point,
I have no idea whatsoever.

1598
01:51:59,797 --> 01:52:02,924
-Julia, that won't do.
-All right, then.

1599
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:05,635
l love it.

1600
01:52:07,221 --> 01:52:10,807
She said "hate"?
Julia Child used the word "hate"?

1601
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:12,934
No.

1602
01:52:13,602 --> 01:52:17,897
But she said I wasn't respectful,
or serious, or something.

1603
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:20,733
How much more serious could a person be?

1604
01:52:21,527 --> 01:52:25,321
Do you think
she thinks I'm sort of using her?

1605
01:52:25,989 --> 01:52:28,199
She can't have read your blog.

1606
01:52:28,283 --> 01:52:29,867
Did she read it?

1607
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:32,245
He didn't know if she'd read it.

1608
01:52:32,329 --> 01:52:35,164
But she definitely had an opinion about it.

1609
01:52:35,249 --> 01:52:39,001
Do you think it's because I use
the "F" word every so often?

1610
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:41,879
Could be. Who knows?

1611
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:46,426
Look, there's something wrong with her
if she doesn't get what you're doing.

1612
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:48,261
There is nothing wrong with her. Nothing.

1613
01:52:48,345 --> 01:52:50,638
I've spent a year with her. She's perfect.

1614
01:52:50,722 --> 01:52:53,057
The Julia Child in your head is perfect,

1615
01:52:53,142 --> 01:52:56,727
the Julia Child that doesn't understand
what you're doing is not perfect.

1616
01:52:56,812 --> 01:52:59,730
The one in your head is the one that matters.

1617
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:04,235
I'm never gonna meet her.

1618
01:53:05,487 --> 01:53:07,488
But you already know her.

1619
01:53:09,366 --> 01:53:12,618
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Anytime.

1620
01:53:14,204 --> 01:53:17,206
-She saved me.
-You saved yourself.

1621
01:53:17,499 --> 01:53:20,960
I was drowning
and she pulled me out of the ocean.

1622
01:53:21,044 --> 01:53:22,920
Don't get carried away.

1623
01:53:25,883 --> 01:53:27,592
Julia child began Iearning to cook

1624
01:53:27,676 --> 01:53:30,303
because she Loved her husband,
and she Loved food,

1625
01:53:30,387 --> 01:53:32,180
and she didn't know
what eIse to do with herseIf.

1626
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:35,308
And, in the process, she found joy.

1627
01:53:35,392 --> 01:53:38,769
I didn't understand this for a Iong time,
but I do now.

1628
01:53:38,854 --> 01:53:40,771
Julia taught me that.

1629
01:53:40,856 --> 01:53:43,566
But here's what Julia really taught me.

1630
01:53:46,945 --> 01:53:47,987
So here we are.

1631
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:50,740
One day to go and one recipe.

1632
01:53:53,243 --> 01:53:57,997
You may think that boning a duck
is an impossibIe feat.

1633
01:53:58,081 --> 01:54:00,166
-And the whoIe procedure...
-Nothing is impossible.

1634
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:04,795
...can take as Iong as 45 minutes
the first time because of fear.

1635
01:54:05,631 --> 01:54:07,256
Don't be afraid.

1636
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:09,592
No fear, Julia. No fear.

1637
01:54:09,676 --> 01:54:12,637
Take your knife, confront the duck.

1638
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:15,056
Confronting the duck. You're my duck.

1639
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:19,393
You make a deep sIit
down the back of the bird

1640
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:25,608
all the way from the neck down to the taiI
to expose the backbone.

1641
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:30,238
And with a small, sharp knife,
its edge aIways cutting against the bone...

1642
01:54:30,322 --> 01:54:33,991
I did it. Look at that, Julia.
It looks just like yours.

1643
01:54:35,410 --> 01:54:38,788
...down one side of the bird...
...pulling the fIesh.

1644
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:43,376
Thread the boned duck on a board,
face skin side down.

1645
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:46,128
...patting it into pIace. Roll out the dough.

1646
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:51,467
...two hours and remove it from the oven
and let it cooI for severaI hours.

1647
01:54:51,552 --> 01:54:54,637
lt looks exactly the way
it's supposed to look.

1648
01:54:55,931 --> 01:54:58,099
Here you go. Can you grab the plates, too?

1649
01:54:58,183 --> 01:55:00,393
-You sure?
-I got it.

1650
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:03,813
Coming around.

1651
01:55:06,316 --> 01:55:08,109
Here she comes. Wow!

1652
01:55:09,945 --> 01:55:12,655
Thank you. La pi¨¨ce de r¨¦sistance.

1653
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:18,369
365 days. 524 recipes.

1654
01:55:22,416 --> 01:55:25,001
-Congratulations!
-Thank you, guys.

1655
01:55:26,545 --> 01:55:29,338
Babe. It's fantastic.

1656
01:55:30,173 --> 01:55:31,465
So great.

1657
01:55:32,676 --> 01:55:34,677
l love it. I love it.

1658
01:55:38,473 --> 01:55:41,517
Eric, I could never have done this
without you.

1659
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:44,270
As someone once said,

1660
01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:47,857
you are the butter to my bread,
the breath to my life.

1661
01:55:50,027 --> 01:55:51,527
To my husband.

1662
01:55:52,988 --> 01:55:54,572
l love you, babe.

1663
01:55:55,616 --> 01:55:56,824
Thank you.

1664
01:55:56,908 --> 01:55:58,367
So it's over.

1665
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:03,956
The project has come to a cIose.
We're back exactIy where we started,

1666
01:56:04,041 --> 01:56:07,418
Eric, me, the cat, sIightIy worse for wear,

1667
01:56:07,502 --> 01:56:10,379
sitting in the outer boroughs, eating.

1668
01:56:11,006 --> 01:56:12,798
So thanks, everybody.

1669
01:56:13,133 --> 01:56:14,675
And guess what?

1670
01:56:15,385 --> 01:56:17,219
Bon app¨¦tit.

1671
01:56:30,651 --> 01:56:34,403
See how the counters are raised?
She had them made special.

1672
01:56:37,699 --> 01:56:40,284
There's her famous mortar and pestle.

1673
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:42,870
If you say so.

1674
01:56:43,538 --> 01:56:45,289
-Perfect.
-Take my picture.

1675
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:47,875
Okay.

1676
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:52,630
That's nice. Give me something else.

1677
01:56:52,714 --> 01:56:54,924
Here we go. Talking to her.

1678
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:56,634
That's good.

1679
01:56:57,386 --> 01:56:58,511
One more.

1680
01:56:58,595 --> 01:56:59,804
Very sweet.

1681
