1
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,277
There are many schools of
martial arts in our country.

2
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,510
One of which is the Southern style.

3
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,799
Besides Hung, Lau, Choy and
Li, Mok styles,

4
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,795
it also includes a popular style
called Wing Chun Kuen.

5
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,078
Legend has it that Wing Chun Kuen
was founded by a Shaolin Abbess Ng Mui.

6
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,799
She imparted her skills to a girl,
Yim Wing Chun.

7
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,269
Hence the name Wing Chun Kuen.

8
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,399
Yim imparted her skills
to her husband Leung Bok Chau.

9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,153
Leung taught Wong Wah Bo.

10
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,913
Wong taught Leung Jan.

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,670
Leung Jan's family owned a pharmacy,
Hang Sang Tong, in FoShan.

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,671
He was a proficient herbalist
and qualified in bone manipulation.

13
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,799
Leung Jan is a kind and helpful man.
He's very respected in the village.

14
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,872
The villagers called him Master Jan.

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,350
FoShan has another kind and
rigteous man called Chan Wah.

16
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,398
He's brave and would stand
against any injustice.

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,631
He would help anyone in trouble.

18
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,511
There are many Kung Fu experts in FoShan.

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,672
Each has their own training school.

20
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,469
Competition to get into
these schools was strong.

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,074
Chan Wah has always been
interested in Kung Fu.

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,913
He first learnt Kung Fu on his own.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,993
He later became a student of Leung Jan.

24
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,958
He is to become the fifth generation
Wing Chun Master.

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,909
Wah was working as
a cashier at Mok Kei Bank.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,673
He's known as Cashier Wah.

27
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,636
My fellow villagers,

28
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,029
Fatty's stall is now open...

29
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,236
Please buy something.

30
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,357
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've fresh rice dumplings.

31
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,318
Every one is specially made.
Please try one.

32
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,156
lt's very tasty.

33
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,350
Come on, please buy one.

34
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,874
Hey! Tall one....
No, Uncle.

35
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,838
Rice dumpling, look carefully before buying.

36
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,315
Don't you like rice dumplings? OK...

37
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,878
This is a special rice dumpling,
good with either sugar or salt.

38
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,716
This is really special, it tastes wonderful.

39
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,479
Marvellous.

40
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,074
Hey!

41
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,154
- Hey Fatty! l'm looking for a restaurant.
- What?

42
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,869
Are you deaf?
Where's the restaurant?

43
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,157
Straight from here,
then turn left and left and left.

44
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,518
Left and left and left again.
When you see Ah Sao, you're there.

45
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,433
- Fatty!
- Good morning, buying dumplings?

46
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,239
- Wait.
- l've something to tell you.

47
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,390
What? Someone in your family died?

48
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,232
Nonsense, it's your family.

49
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,596
All my family members have died.

50
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,671
l'm the only survivor.

51
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,877
Fatty, someone has been talking about you.

52
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,473
Who's that?

53
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,232
Spittle Mun.

54
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,232
Spittle Mun? l don't know him.
What did he say?

55
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:08,158
He said that Wing Chun Kuen is good
but what you learnt is crap.

56
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,232
Everyone in FoShan
from three to 83 years old

57
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,629
knows that l am a student of Leung Jan.

58
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,871
- Really?
- How old is Spittle Mun?

59
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,672
He's 84.

60
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,069
No wonder.

61
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,912
What's so good about Wing Chun?

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,037
l'm good at Horse Groin Clamps.

63
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,992
The Sifu of my Sifu was practising
Horse Groin Clamps under a big tree.

64
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,629
Suddenly there was a thunderstorm.

65
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,558
A bolt of lightning felled the tree.

66
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,790
The Sifu of my Sifu didn't move an inch.

67
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,916
Such is the power of Horse Groin Clamps.

68
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,555
- That's impressive.
- How is he now?

69
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,189
He got struck by lightning and died.

70
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,430
lt's true, l was told.

71
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,991
Spittle Mun said that
your Horse Groin Clamps isn't that good.

72
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,278
lf l'm in the stance,
ten of you can't move me.

73
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,477
- Really?
- He's boasting.

74
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,712
lf you can handle the power of my palm,
l'll be impressed.

75
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,756
Who do you think you are? Let's try.

76
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,676
Let's bet then, if l can move you with
my palm, you give me all your dumplings.

77
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,193
lf you can't?

78
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,794
Then l'll buy all your dumplings.

79
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,836
- Good.
- Let's do it.

80
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,188
- You're not to move once you're ready.
- OK.

81
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,552
Hey! Mister, stop it. No! No!

82
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,312
Mister!

83
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,109
Why are you taking my dumplings?

84
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,159
l'm not taking your dumplings,
l'm claiming them. You've lost the bet.

85
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,468
Are you denying it?

86
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,755
- l...
- l want to thank you.

87
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,832
- Rice dumplings...
- Savoury dumplings...

88
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,832
Rice dumplings, savoury dumplings,
sweet dumplings...

89
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,951
How many?
Please come inside.

90
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,476
Please be seated.

91
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,759
Please be seated.

92
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,195
Master, be seated.

93
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,114
Damn, the table is too small for seven of us.

94
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,754
We'll sit there, follow me.

95
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,835
Master, l'm sorry but
this table has been reserved.

96
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,831
Reserved? By who?

97
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,435
Master Jan, this is his regular table.

98
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,592
Master Jan? Never heard of him. Sit.

99
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,079
Master...

100
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,319
Master Jan.

101
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,517
Third Uncle, look at them.

102
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,556
lt's nothing to do with you.

103
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,672
So you're Master Jan.

104
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,796
Yes, what can l do for you?

105
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,836
Who is this girl?

106
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,480
She's my niece.

107
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,711
She's taken my seat,
what are you doing about it?

108
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,836
l apologise.

109
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,957
Kam Fung, stand up and
give your seat back to him.

110
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,350
Bitch, trying to make fun of me?

111
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,673
Stop it!

112
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,554
We've just arrived and
you're already in trouble.

113
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,312
lt's not a time to fight.

114
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,229
Gentleman, please tell me,
where is the Mok Kei Bank?

115
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,596
Those bullies must have
taken advantage of you again.

116
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,315
Cashier Wah, you can help someone poor.
Can you cure someone stupid?

117
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,755
l don't think so.

118
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,231
l want a change of career.
l'll sell watermelons next.

119
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,915
Why? You make a loss
whenever you sell something.

120
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,118
Even if people don't cheat you,
you end up eating all your stock.

121
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,031
Why don't you give me some advice?
What business should l do?

122
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,752
There's a job that you won't be cheated in
and you won't eat anything.

123
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,315
- Fatty, not selling dumplings any more?
- l have a new career.

124
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,915
New career? What are you selling now?
Can it be eaten?

125
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,110
You're clearing shit now?

126
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,032
lf l don't change my career,
you'll cheat me again.

127
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,034
Boss, we thought you were dead.
We're surprised to see you here.

128
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,956
There's one more thing
that you'll never guess.

129
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,158
l've opened a bank here
using the money we made together.

130
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,191
We've been doing good business.
We've made twice as much now.

131
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,316
Let's split the money.

132
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,439
lron Fist, you really are a pea-brain.

133
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,432
Because of Mok Kei Bank

134
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,116
l am a respectable man in this village.

135
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,112
Boss, respectability doesn't buy food.

136
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,955
But l can use it as a springboard.

137
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,834
What do you have in mind?

138
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,793
l want to control FoShan.

139
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,590
There's still a bill in my pocket.
No wonder l couldn't balance the account.

140
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,754
lf l become the Village Head here,
you guys will have nothing to worry about.

141
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,832
Aren't you afraid of other contenders?

142
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,830
There's only one person in this village
who could compete with me.

143
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,309
- Who's he?
- Leung Jan.

144
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,114
lf we want to kill the current Village Head,
it's easy.

145
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,639
We just have to make it
look like an accident.

146
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,517
l've already got a plan.

147
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,718
Who's that?
Rushing around like a blind chicken?

148
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,873
Master Yao, l've something important
to tell the Village Head.

149
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,911
What makes you think that
the Village Head doesn't need to sleep?

150
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,956
What's the matter?

151
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,756
- Really?
- Yes.

152
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,150
l didn't know that Boss Mok was like that.

153
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,232
l hope you have not told anyone about this.

154
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,958
l haven't.

155
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,638
Good!

156
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,471
This is an important matter,
you have to tell the Village Head personally.

157
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,076
But you can't do it in his house.

158
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,357
Let's meet at the Mountain Pavilion
early in the morning.

159
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,159
l'll come with the Village Head.

160
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,792
Cashier Wah, it was your misfortune
to have bumped into me.

161
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,235
This must be the worst day of your life.

162
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,276
What do you mean?

163
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,356
lt means that you have shit luck.

164
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,510
Luck of a lump of shit.

165
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,433
l don't know what are you talking about.

166
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,398
- Where's the Village Head?
- The Village Head.

167
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,556
My job is done.

168
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,036
Brother Wah, what happened?

169
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,592
Where is he?

170
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,756
- Search inside.
- OK.

171
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,636
What happened to him?

172
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,837
l don't know, ask him when he's conscious.

173
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,959
- You want Cashier Wah to come to us?
- Yes.

174
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,919
Cashier Wah is a loyal family man.

175
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,272
lf something happens to his mother,
he'll definitely come to us.

176
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,190
Remember, this time don't let him escape.

177
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,596
You have a good rest.

178
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,350
Fatty, go to my house and
tell my mother not to worry about me.

179
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,829
OK, l'll do it now.

180
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,915
What happened?

181
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,550
l'm not sure, but l heard that Cashier Wah's
mother was killed by bandits last night.

182
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,120
Where's Cashier Wah?

183
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,872
l don't know.

184
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,511
l've sent someone to the Mok Kei Bank
for him but he didn't go to work.

185
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,512
- Put more men on the case, find him.
- OK.

186
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,548
Fatty, how is my mum?

187
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,832
She's very well.

188
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,956
Did she tell you anything?

189
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,155
She said...

190
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,913
She said you shouldn't rush to see her.

191
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,072
Fatty, besides my mum,
did you see anyone else?

192
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,596
Yes, l saw the Village Head.

193
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,195
- ln my house?
- No, l saw him walking past.

194
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,236
- Fatty, l have another favour to ask you.
- What?

195
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,392
Tell the Village Head that
someone is trying to kill him.

196
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,198
Ask him to be careful.

197
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,475
- ls it true?
- Yes.

198
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,359
Fatty.

199
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,514
Tell the Village Head personally,
don't let anyone know about it.

200
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,798
Fatty, any women bathing inside?
Why can't l see it?

201
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,628
- lnside? Nothing there.
- Nothing?

202
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,518
lf there's nothing there,
what are you peeping at?

203
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,238
Nothing.

204
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,710
- lf there's nothing to see, get out of here.
- All right.

205
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,635
What are you looking at, bum?

206
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,880
Hey! Village Head.

207
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,599
- What is it?
- l've something to tell you.

208
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,830
l'm busy, what is it?

209
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,870
- Someone wants to kill you.
- What?

210
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,633
Someone is trying to kill you,
you must be careful.

211
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,917
Watch what you say.
Who wants to kill the village head?

212
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,514
- l don't know.
- Then what are you on about?

213
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,589
Nonsense.

214
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,389
Trust me for once, l'm not lying.

215
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,313
Who told you that?

216
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,394
Someone, but l can't tell you his name.

217
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,072
You are talking nonsense.

218
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,312
Me? Talking nonsense? l don't think so.

219
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,148
Stupid Fatty, l told you to get lost.
What are you doing here?

220
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,357
- Nothing, nothing.
- Get lost then.

221
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,829
- OK, l'm going.
- Scram.

222
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,839
- Why the leg?
- l'm sorry.

223
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,559
Looking for trouble?

224
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,512
l'll kill you... l'll kill you!

225
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,237
- What are you doing?
- Cramps.

226
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,036
Much better now.

227
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,636
Where has he gone?

228
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,268
The next time l see you, you'll be dead.

229
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,070
Fatty was telling the truth.

230
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,718
Village Head!

231
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,834
Serving The People

232
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,912
Why isn't he here yet?
We're very busy.

233
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,439
My fellow villagers, we've tried our best
to find the Village Head.

234
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,478
This meeting can't happen without him.

235
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,759
According to our constitution, if the
Village Head fails to attend without reason,

236
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,833
we have the right to choose another head.

237
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,598
Before we have more news
from the Village Head,

238
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:47,518
l recommend that all his duties
fall to the boss of Mok Kei Bank.

239
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,478
How about that?

240
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,028
- Good, good, good.
- l agree.

241
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,870
Cashier Wah, where are you going?

242
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,837
To see my mum.

243
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,911
You can't show yourself yet.

244
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,515
l'll be careful.
l'll return as soon as l see her.

245
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,351
- You won't recognise her.
- What do you mean?

246
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,149
Your mum is dead.

247
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,152
Fatty, say that again.

248
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,597
l'm not lying.
l saw the undertakers carrying her out.

249
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,192
lt can't be true!

250
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,872
Don't go! lf those seven guys see you,
they won't let you go.

251
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,951
They killed my mother. l want revenge.

252
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,472
Listen to me.

253
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,751
They did it to lure you out.

254
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,796
You will fall for their trick if you go.

255
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,996
l must avenge my mother's death.

256
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,838
You're not their match,
they are too strong for you.

257
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,073
lf you want revenge, go beg my Sifu.

258
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,593
Beg Master Jan.

259
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,638
Cashier Wah is at Master Jan's.

260
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,429
Yes, l just found out.

261
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,876
l never expected Leung Jan to get involved.

262
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,995
lt doesn't look like it.

263
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,995
lf Leung Jan wanted to get involved,
he would do something.

264
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,635
Anyway, Leung Jan is a nuisance to us.

265
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,237
Let's show him who's in charge.

266
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,231
Master Jan.

267
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,511
Master Jan, l've not eaten for two days.

268
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,151
Thank you.

269
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,669
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

270
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,354
Good morning, Master Jan.

271
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,275
What a coincidence. Please, join me.

272
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,710
- l'll do it myself.
- Fine.

273
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,791
Please have some tea.

274
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,789
Master Jan, we are here specially for you.

275
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,112
What can l do for you?

276
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,998
A simple task, give us our man.

277
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,274
Your man?

278
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,148
Cashier Wah is of no use to you.

279
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,028
You two have misunderstood.
l haven't sheltered Cashier Wah.

280
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,192
He's just another of my patients.

281
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,829
l've no intention of getting involved
between you and him.

282
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,472
Until he's fully recovered,
he'll remain in my establishment.

283
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,949
That's my responsibility.

284
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,476
Trade him with your own life then.

285
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,718
Stop it!

286
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,756
Who are you?
How dare you start trouble here?

287
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,393
These guys obey you.
You can't be good.

288
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,953
Master Jan, how did you
get mixed up with these people?

289
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,510
l must have offended them
when l was much younger.

290
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,397
- Ah Mao!
- Yes.

291
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,555
l'll pay for the damage.

292
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,912
You don't have to.

293
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,673
Thank you, Master Jan.

294
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,475
- Boss Mok, l have to go now.
- Please.

295
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,749
Herbs Encyclopaedia

296
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,675
Cashier Wah, l don't know what
dispute you have with those people.

297
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,876
And l don't wish to know.

298
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,512
Since you've fully recovered,
you can go now.

299
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,957
Master Jan, why won't you adopt me?

300
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,589
You want me to adopt you
as my student only for revenge.

301
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,593
To learn Kung Fu for revenge
is against the principle.

302
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,433
- Master Jan, those are bad people.
- Enough.

303
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,672
To settle any dispute,
one party has to give in first.

304
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,718
That's the only way to avoid bloodshed.

305
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,635
Cashier Wah, you can go now,
l won't take you as my student.

306
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,150
- Sifu.
- Sifu.

307
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,592
Thank you.

308
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,110
Sifu, is Cashier Wah
still kneeling in the study?

309
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,640
- Third Uncle...
- How many times have l told you?

310
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,075
No talking when you are eating.

311
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,553
Sifu, l know.
No talking when l'm eating.

312
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,515
Come on, please take a seat first.

313
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,596
Don't choke yourself.

314
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,117
Fatty, your idea didn't work.
lf l kneel any longer, l'll be paralysed.

315
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,273
Sifu is a very conservative man.

316
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,273
What should l do now?
Should l kneel or should l go?

317
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,319
What next?

318
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,233
l'm thinking about it.

319
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,553
Third Uncle, have some tea, please.

320
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,078
Kam Fung, has Cashier Wah left?

321
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,153
No, but he's found another Sifu.

322
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,394
Another Sifu?

323
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,590
- Sifu's here, get ready.
- OK.

324
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,636
Kneel down, kneel down.

325
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,709
Little Sifu, have some tea, please.

326
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,196
Fatty, what are you doing?

327
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,119
Since you rejected him as a student,
l've decided to teach him myself.

328
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,634
Now he is to call me Sifu.

329
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,837
- Student.
- Here.

330
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,911
- On your feet.
- Yes.

331
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,393
l'll teach you some basics.

332
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,034
Little Sifu, why are you not
using your hands?

333
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,271
- This is the Handless style.
- What stance is this?

334
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,033
This is the Two Gangsters stance.

335
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,317
Push your bum forward.

336
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,393
What's the function of this.

337
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,517
Wing Chun practitioners' way
of healing piles.

338
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,068
ls this Wing Chun style?

339
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,391
Why do you care? Just do what l say.

340
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,029
ln Wing Chun, our hand
has to look like Snake or Crane...

341
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,548
Why is your Crane slanted?

342
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,834
This is the Slanted Crane from Wing Chun.

343
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,989
Hand block.

344
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,390
Left block, right block, big block.

345
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,799
Last block, done.

346
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,632
Why are you keeping
the blocks in your pocket?

347
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,748
We have so many blocks,
where else can you keep them?

348
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,232
That makes sense.

349
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,232
ln Wing Chun, we go over the bridge,
not under it. Show me your hand.

350
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,633
- What if there's no bridge?
- No bridge?

351
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,756
Build one yourself, stupid.

352
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,910
Build a bridge?

353
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,752
How do l do that?

354
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,636
What does this look like?

355
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,156
- A bridge.
- Yes, it's more like a bridge than a tunnel.

356
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,155
Do you understand now?

357
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,755
Let's have a sparring match.
We'll see whose style is better.

358
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,150
But l warn you that Wing Chun
is unbeatable, you can't touch me.

359
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,390
This is Cultivating Hand.

360
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,119
This is Twisted Hand. The next is...

361
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,076
Little Sifu, what's the next move?

362
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,276
Back arch... lt hurts!

363
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,072
Watch out again.

364
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,673
- Sifu...
- You are a disgrace to Wing Chun.

365
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,071
Here, come on.

366
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,551
He will adopt you as his student.

367
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,835
Quick, serve Sifu some tea.

368
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,876
Sifu.

369
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,192
Abbess Ng Mui developed Wing Chun
after witnessing a snake and a crane fight.

370
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,589
She later refined it to three routines.

371
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,989
The first routine is Little ldeas.

372
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,237
Why is it called Little ldeas?

373
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,392
Sifu doubts that we will learn
the whole system of Wing Chun,

374
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,995
so he won't teach us Big Thoughts,
he will only give us Little ldeas.

375
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,036
Hence the term Little ldeas.

376
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,596
Stay focused!

377
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,109
Hey! We've learnt this before.

378
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,034
- Let's practise somewhere else.
- Good idea.

379
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,631
Searching the Bridge.

380
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,152
Darting Fingers.

381
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,908
Our moves come from the heart,
our strength from the ground.

382
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,309
The Six in One Move is from your

383
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,515
ankle,

384
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,828
knee,

385
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,273
waist,

386
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,634
shoulder,

387
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,472
elbow and wrist.

388
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,109
Strength from the six points
merge to form the Six in One Move.

389
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,316
The weakest part is your fist.

390
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,109
Other parts, like your palm,
elbow and shoulder,

391
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,591
could be attacked and defended.

392
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,673
The fist has three points.
Two points are here, watch.

393
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,798
The palm has three angles.

394
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,796
Palm should be flexible.

395
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,996
Hand can be snake or crane.

396
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,868
The form resembles a chicken,
the force resembles a cat.

397
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,714
The energy should be
directed at the enemy.

398
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,357
Expend your energy only when necessary.

399
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,314
l'm teaching you the most fundamental
technique of Wing Chun, Separate Hand.

400
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,038
Attack me.

401
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,310
This is Deadly Slap.

402
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,838
Dispersing Attack.

403
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,550
Winged Arm Darting Punch.

404
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,713
Controlling Arm.

405
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,756
Subdue Head, Rattle Tail.

406
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,395
Divert the attack, Linking Fast Palms.

407
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,438
Come again.

408
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,671
Cultivating Hand.

409
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,956
This is the Fiery Dragon.

410
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,796
Follow me.

411
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,796
Show me two fingers.

412
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,116
When l let go, catch it.

413
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,236
Pick it up.

414
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,276
Let's try again.

415
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,230
Do you know why you can't catch it?

416
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,196
Your eyes see it and alert the brain

417
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,955
before signalling your fingers to catch -
all this takes too long.

418
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,350
That's why in Wing Chun
there's a technique called Sticky Hand.

419
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,159
Sticky Hand trains the sensitivity
of your hand.

420
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,036
lt also allows you
to apply force appropriately.

421
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,712
Do you understand?

422
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,310
- Fatty.
- Yes, Sifu.

423
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,356
Practise with him.

424
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,868
Just now you are using lmpetus Power.

425
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,951
lmpetus Power combined with
Directional Power

426
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,999
will result in a momentous explosive force.

427
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,514
This is the power of combined force.

428
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,160
Sifu, what if the enemy uses his legs?

429
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,071
You try.

430
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,356
Use your arms to block high kicks.

431
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,789
Use your legs to negate the low kicks.
Do you understand?

432
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,915
Vengeance

433
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,436
Cashier Wah, l'll teach you
the secrets of Wing Chun,

434
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,592
l hope that you'll pass it on.

435
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,672
Sifu, l won't disappoint you.

436
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,998
Block it.

437
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,629
You must use the fastest time
and the shortest contact

438
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,632
to get these two dummies
back to their place.

439
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,392
Sifu.

440
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,278
You can't even control two dummies.

441
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,397
lf l were your third enemy,
you would be dead.

442
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,880
Start from the top.

443
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,356
With your skill you can defeat
more than two dummies.

444
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,560
Your problem is that you can't concentrate.

445
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,712
When you enter this dummy corridor

446
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,995
you only have one thing in mind.

447
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,035
Vengeance

448
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,477
Fatty has improved so much.
He's been scoring.

449
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,591
Sifu, he's...

450
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,198
Every martial art practitioner
has weaknesses.

451
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,796
Even someone who has mastered
the lnvincible Armour technique.

452
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,348
The most common weak points are,

453
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,714
the eyes and the groin.

454
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,399
To attack the weak points
is not an easy task.

455
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,473
The human body
has 108 basic pressure points.

456
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,233
The lnvincible Armour
technique won't change this.

457
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,471
The points are consistently
around the same area.

458
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,396
The lnvincible Armour
is not hurt by a normal punch.

459
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,914
But would be hurt by an impetus punch.

460
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,596
As long as you disturb his energy flow,
you have a chance to attack his weak points.

461
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:13,151
The weakest points with
the biggest surface area are

462
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,994
the feet and the side of the feet.

463
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:21,995
Now, l'll teach you the Wing Chun
Six and a Half points Pole.

464
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,719
First point, Twins on a Flute.

465
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,676
Second point, Falling Sky.
Third point, Deadly Ground.

466
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,030
Fourth Point, Monkey Stealing Peach.

467
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,680
Left Block, Right Bloom.

468
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,480
Beauty Rowing a Raft, only half a point.

469
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:51,315
Put together it becomes
Six and a Half points Pole.

470
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:56,554
The most difficult parts of this technique
are stabbing and dispersing.

471
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,270
lt's about the way you disperse
your energy to the tip of the pole.

472
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,715
The pole has elasticity.

473
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,679
Our aim is to combine its elasticity
with our applied force effectively.

474
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,594
Now, l want you to crush this olive stone.

475
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,753
You didn't combine
all your energy effectively.

476
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,752
You are only able to push the stone aside.

477
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,595
Try again.

478
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,198
Sifu.

479
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,840
Practice makes perfect.

480
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,957
No pain, no gain.

481
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,554
You should know the philosophy.

482
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,474
Don't worry.
Pick up all the olive stones now.

483
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,516
Try again.

484
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,350
Don't stop.

485
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,592
Sifu, l'm...

486
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,275
Your target is never stationary.

487
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:27,434
lf you respond only to your opponent's move,
it's already too late.

488
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,877
You have to reach the stage
when you hit whatever you see.

489
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,238
Try again.

490
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,719
l'm not worried about Cashier Wah.

491
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,872
lt's Leung Jan that l'm wary of.

492
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,238
- Master Jan won't compete with you.
- l know.

493
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,598
But he's sheltering Cashier Wah.

494
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,759
He might cause a problem in the future.

495
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,913
Master Jan is not a simple man.

496
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:55,192
- Mister Yao, everyone has a habit.
- That's true.

497
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,317
- Habits mean weaknesses.
- True.

498
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,554
He might be very skilful but he's still human.

499
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,557
Master Jan.

500
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,710
What's happening?

501
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,156
We are having renovations done,
please sit upstairs.

502
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,756
Master Jan, please be seated.

503
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,273
Master Jan.

504
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,554
l'm very hungry.

505
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,839
You...

506
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:40,037
l've not offended you
so why are you attacking me?

507
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,669
Killing you will get rid of
a pain in my backside.

508
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,389
Third Uncle, Third Uncle!

509
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,759
Stop it.

510
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,115
You will die together now.

511
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,431
- Junior, even Sifu lost to them.
- What should we do?

512
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,431
- Go with Cashier Wah.
- And you?

513
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,953
l'll take care of myself.

514
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,991
He's escaped.

515
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,116
Stupid Fatty,
not happy with the way you died?

516
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,998
lt's Fatty.

517
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,758
- What have you found out.
- What happened?

518
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,956
Mok has become the Village Head.

519
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,600
- He's taken over the village office?
- Yes.

520
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,716
Where are his accomplices?

521
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,114
Let me think.

522
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,031
l know.

523
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,429
We'll have to attack them separately.

524
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,873
Kam Fung.

525
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,839
Use the Eight Slashing Knife
to counter Tiger's Long Spear.

526
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,078
Fatty, use your Sticky Hand
to counter Thunder's technique.

527
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:31,308
l'll use my Six and a Half Point Pole
against lron Fist.

528
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,396
Let's do it tonight.

529
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,959
l have to go.

530
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,110
- No don't go.
- lt's getting late.

531
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,714
- l'll come tomorrow night.
- Master.

532
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,436
Please come again.

533
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,149
Thunder.

534
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,958
You!

535
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,795
l'm Tiger, Thunder wouldn't visit
such a place.

536
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,871
Shit. l've got the names mixed up.

537
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,474
l'm in big trouble.

538
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,039
Bamboo.

539
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,518
Bamboo forest.

540
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,276
Kam Fung, help me. He's here.

541
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,596
lt's no use. Get ready to see your dead Sifu.

542
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,717
Your hand got stuck to mine.

543
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,596
Sifu...

544
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,116
Why did you die so easily?

545
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,590
Are you really dead?

546
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,875
l'm talking to you. Are you dead?

547
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,636
You're really dead.

548
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:45,479
lf l see you down below,
l'll kill you again and again.

549
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,753
Stupid Fatty mixed up the names.

550
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,990
l wonder how Fatty is doing?

551
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,359
What's happening?

552
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,432
We have intruders.
You two take care of them.

553
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,476
l'll go and get Boss Mok.

554
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,075
Kam Fung, why couldn't you last longer?

555
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,316
l give up.

556
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,316
Does Boss Mok know Kung Fu?

557
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,278
You're asking me?
How should l know?

558
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,590
l think l can take on the Fatty.

559
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,119
You.

560
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,159
Yes.

561
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,312
Come on.

562
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,755
Stupid Fatty, went for my weaker leg.

563
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,197
No, l'll do it myself.

564
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,478
Praying mantis.

565
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,155
Left, right, left, die.

566
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,830
- What's wrong?
- Cramps.

567
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,072
Much better.

568
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,117
Where is he?

569
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:45,196
Why is your head so hard?

570
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,789
There's a plate on top.

571
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:51,190
Should have kept you guessing.

572
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,748
l'll pretend l don't know.

573
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,072
Take that.

574
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:18,870
- Why can't you feel that?
- That's my numb and useless leg.

575
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,036
- Are you going to let me through?
- Yes, of course.

576
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,111
Smart move.

577
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,110
Let me down!

578
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,918
Do you like it?

579
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,230
l have a child and a wife, let me go!

580
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,910
Let me down!

581
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,233
Stupid Fatty.

582
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,909
Thank you.

583
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,911
Thanks a lot.

584
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,956
You peed yourself.

585
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,477
l know.

586
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,192
This is Praying Mantis Grip.

587
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,230
This is Fat Bird Pecking.

588
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,596
Fatty, are you all right?

589
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,758
l'm all right. Let's beat him together.

590
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,718
- How?
- l'll take his blows, you hit him.

591
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,349
- OK.
- l'm willing to die.

592
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,198
Hit his head.

593
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:07,359
Don't worry about me. Kill him.

594
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:02,958
l'm falling.

595
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,636
Fatty, are you all right?

596
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,278
- Can you stand?
- l'm not dead yet.

597
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,999
- Can you walk?
- No, you had better...

598
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,196
You want me to carry you?

599
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,589
No, l'll crawl out of here.

600
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:25,716
Let's go, then.
