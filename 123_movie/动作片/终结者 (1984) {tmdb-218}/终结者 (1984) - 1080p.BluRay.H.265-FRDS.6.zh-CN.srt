Sent over from the Valley division this afternoon.

149
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,710
我肯定這些命案是有動機的
Are you sure there's a point to all of this?

150
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,879
看看死者的名字
Look at the name, Ed.

151
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,110
莎拉…
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

152
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,300
康…有沒有弄錯？
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

153
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,095
你說笑吧
You're kidding me.

154
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,848
報紙會大做文章的
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.

155
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,363
一個在一天內有特定模式的兇手
A one-day pattern killer.

156
00:22:31,363 --> 00:22:33,352
我討厭古怪的案件
I hate the weird ones.

157
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,380


158
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,817
所以…
So...

159
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,612
比凡人得到的更好
Better than mortal man deserves.

160
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,823
- 你有沒有見過寶斯利？ - 最近沒有
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley? - Not lately.

161
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:55,249
你聽了留言沒有？
Did you check messages?

162
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,060


163
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,251
我以為你聽了
I thought you did.

164
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,190
莎拉，是媽
Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...

165
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,885
原來你在這裡
There you are, young man.

166
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,950


167
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,220
你想想你媽吧
You mind your mother.

168
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,420
再見

169
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,978
你好，莎拉，史丹莫斯基.  有突發事件...
Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky. Something's come up.

170
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,920


171
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,268
...令我不能應約了
Looks like I won't be able to make it tonight.

172
00:23:18,268 --> 00:23:19,398
我不能丟下不理的
Just can't get out of it.

173
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,430


174
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,365
對不起，我會給你賠罪的
I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.

175
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:24,320
改天找你吧，對不起，再見
Call you in a day or so. Bye.

176
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,290


177
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,491
那個混蛋，有輛保時捷又怎樣
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

178
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,270


179
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,208
他不能這樣對待你的
He can't treat you like this.

180
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,120
這是週五晚上
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

181
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,206
我沒事的
I'll live.

182
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,459
我會打爆他的膝蓋
I'll break his kneecaps.

183
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:43,547
寶斯利仍然愛我，是嗎？
Well, Pugsley still loves me. Don't you, baby?

184
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,759
天，真噁心
God. It's disgusting.

185
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,672
我去看電影
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.

186
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:51,555
你和麥特玩得開心點
Have a good time.

187
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,590


188
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,642
- 我們會的. 你也是. - 好的
- We will. You, too. - OK.

189
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,600


190
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,814
該死，麥特
Damn it, Matt.

191
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,332
該死
- Oh, shit. - Lieutenant!

192
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,860


193
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,406
你們可有察覺那些命案
These killings occurred in the order of...

194
00:25:02,406 --> 00:25:04,003
是依電話簿裡的次序發生的？
...their listings in the phone book.

195
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,058
我可以說什麼？無可奉告
What can I tell you? No comment.

196
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:08,670
但是發生了兩宗命案…
But, Lieutenant...

197
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,670


198
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,645
那杯咖啡早就涼了
That coffee's two hours cold.

199
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,815
我還用它弄熄香煙
I put a cigarette out in it.

200
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,676
你能找到下一名女子嗎？
Did you reach the next girl yet?

201
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:29,319
我不斷聽到電話留言…
No. I got her answering machine.

202
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,941
- 派一組人去 - 已經派了
- Send a unit. - I sent a unit.

203
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:31,947
沒有回音，
There's no answer.

204
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,090


205
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,639
那個經理還沒有回家
The apartment manager's not in.

206
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:34,116
打電話給她
Call her.

207
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,130


208
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,493
- 剛打了  -再打一次
- I just called her. - Call her again.

209
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,990


210
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,204
給我一支香煙
Give me a cigarette.

211
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,350
你好
Hi, there.

212
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,340
捉弄到你了，你在跟答錄機談話
Fooled you. You're talking to a machine.

213
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,860
但別害羞，答錄機也需要愛的
But don't be shy. It's OK. Machines need love, too,

214
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,020
跟它談談吧，金珍，就是我…
so talk to it...

215
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,060
或者莎拉會回覆你的，等候訊號

216
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,814
又是一樣
Same shit.

217
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,284
我現在聽到了
I can hear it now.

218
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:11,236
就叫他做「電話簿殺手」吧
He's gonna be called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

219
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,718
我討厭這些報界觸目的案件
I hate these press cases.

220
00:26:13,718 --> 00:26:16,658
特別是變態的觸目案件
Especially the weird press cases.

221
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,070


222
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,420
你去哪裡？
Where are you going?

223
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,621
發表聲明
To make a statement.

224
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,000


225
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,956
叫這班走狗替我們工作
Maybe make these jackals work for us for a change.

226
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,964
若我可以在11點前上電視…
If I can get on the tube by 11:00,

227
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:27,669
或者她會找我們的
maybe she'll call us.

228
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,740


229
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,422
怎樣？ 我的樣子怎樣？
Well, how do I look?

230
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,820


231
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,884
-很難看，老總  -不錯
- Like shit, boss. - Your mama.

232
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,880


233
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,180
剛收到消息. 警方已經宣佈了...
This just in. Police have announced the name of the victim

234
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,290


235
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,954
第二名死者的姓名
in the second of two execution style murders...

236
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:42,392
是今天發生的命案
...which took place today.

237
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,800


238
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,899
很奇怪，兩名死者都是同名同姓
Incredibly, the names of the two victims...

239
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:46,355
很奇怪，兩名死者都是同名同姓
...are virtually identical.

240
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,489
兩小時前，35歲的莎拉康納…
Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann Connor...

241
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:51,670
被發現死在寓所裡
...was pronounced dead...

242
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,670


243
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,029
- 轉台吧 - 莎拉康納…
- Can we change this? - Sarah Louise Connor...

244
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,781
別碰它
Don't touch it!

245
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,740
在她家中被殺

246
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,980
警方拒絕猜測…
Police are refusing to speculate on...

247
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,412
兩宗案件的類似之處…
...the similarity between the shooting deaths

248
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,980


249
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,992
現在仍未發現兩者之間有何關連
and no other connection...

250
00:27:03,992 --> 00:27:06,667
現在仍未發現兩者之間有何關連
...between the two victims has been established yet.

251
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,212
我們會隨時為大家報導最新消息
We'll have more on this late-breaking story as it comes in.

252
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,250
（莎拉康納…）

253
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,910
（黑科技酒吧）

254
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,639
- 有電話嗎？ - 在裡面
- Hey, you got a phone? - It's in the back.

255
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,099
四塊半.
Hey, $4.50.

256
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,380


257
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,355
你已接通洛杉磯警局緊急熱線
You have reached...

258
00:29:26,355 --> 00:29:28,558
你已接通洛杉磯警局緊急熱線
...the Los Angeles Police Department emergency number.

259
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,939
我們的線路正在忙線中
All lines are busy.

260
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:33,522
如果需召警車支援，請稍候
If you need a police car sent out to you, stay on the line.

261
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,530


262
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,100
在第三街與奧林匹克街交界 的鮑勃酒舖附近有狀況

263
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,171
走開
Pugsley! Shoo!

264
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,730


265
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,965
我會拿你來製皮帶
Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

266
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,910


267
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,607
別逼我打你
Don't make me bust you up, man.

268
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,647
你好
Hi, there.

269
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:01,061
捉弄到你了，
Fooled you.

270
00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:02,963
你在跟答錄機談話
You're talking to a machine.

271
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,850


272
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,007
但別害羞，答錄機也需要愛的
But don't be shy. It's OK. Machines need love, too.

273
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,362
跟它談談吧…金珍，就是我…
So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,

274
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:10,137
或者莎拉會回覆你的，
or Sarah will get back to you.

275
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,920


276
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,805
等候訊號
Walit for the beep.

277
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,267
金珍，是莎拉，快接聽
Ginger, this is Sarah. Pick up if you're there.

278
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:19,600
我在比科大道的黑科技酒吧
I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard called Tech Noir.

279
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,273
我很害怕
I'm really scared.

280
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,300


281
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,026
有人跟蹤我
I think that there's somebody after me.

282
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,361
我希望你快點聽這個留言
I hope that you play this back soon.

283
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,810


284
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,656
我想你來接我
I need you and Matt to come and pick me up as soon as possible.

285
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,169
警方不停轉接我的電話線
The police keep transferring me around.

286
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:33,535
我會再試的
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

這裡的號碼是5559175
The number here is 555-9175.

288
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,041
快找我，我要你幫忙
Call me, kiddo. I need your help.

289
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,070
（莎拉康納）

290
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,477
是她
It's her.

291
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,980
- 莎拉康納？我是特斯勒警長 - 聽著…
Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.

292
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,557
別要我等或者轉線
Lieutenant, don't put me on hold...

293
00:33:03,557 --> 00:33:05,400
別要我等或者轉線
...and don't transfer me to another department.

294
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,410


295
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,069
我不會，你在哪裡？
Don't worry, I won't. Just relax. Can you tell me where you are?

296
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,274
一間叫黑科技的酒吧
I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.

297
00:33:10,274 --> 00:33:12,073
我知道，在比科大道
Yeah, I know it. It's on Pico.

298
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,850


299
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,226
你沒事吧？
Are you all right?

300
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:14,784
沒事，
Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

301
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,250


302
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,358
但我覺得有人在跟蹤我
I think there's a guy following me.

303
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:18,830
注意聽好，
Now, listen carefully.

304
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,730


305
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,400
你待在公共場合會比較安全
You're in a public place so you'll be safe...

306
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,374
我們會盡快趕來
...till we get there.

307
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,870


308
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,500
留在原地，

309
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,835
別出去，別上廁所
Don't go outside or even to the restroom.

310
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,755
- 我會很快派一輛車來 - 好的
- I'll have a car there in a minute. - OK.

311
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,989
那個傢伙沒有付錢
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

312
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,693
你想活著就跟我來
Come with me if you wanna live.

313
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:44,828
快點
Come on!

314
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,695
這是1- L19，有人襲擊後逃跑
This is one-L-19. I got a hit-and-run felony.

...在第七街向西逃走

317
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,702
他開得很快
He's really moving, punching lights all the way.

318
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,200
馬上派救護車來第七街
I'm gonna need an ambulance at Seventh...

319
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,664
和百老匯街交界
...and Broadway right now.

320
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,042
別動
Hold it!

321
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,860
所有單位留意一輛舊型灰色福特

322
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,030
最後被發現在第七街 和百老匯街交界，向西行走

323
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,101
坐穩

你有沒有受傷？
Are you injured?

325
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:47,742
你有沒有中槍？
Are you shot?

326
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,650


327
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,070
照我的話做
Do exactly what I say.

328
00:38:55,796 --> 00:38:56,668


329
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,690
照著做

332

334
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,889
- 明白嗎？ - 明白
- Do you understand? - Yes!

335
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:06,511
求你別傷害我

336
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,030


337

我是來幫你的

346
00:39:53,955 --> 00:39:55,768
我沒做過什麼
I didn't do anything.

347
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:57,350


348

350
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,590


351
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,192
不是真的 那個人怎能站起來追你…
This isn't true. How could that man just get up after you...

352
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,737
它不是人.  是機器，
It's not a man. A machine.

353
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,100

一個魔鬼終結者. 電腦達因系統101型號.

355
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,830


356
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,827
機器？
A machine?

357
00:40:19,827 --> 00:40:21,961
像機械人？
Like a robot?

358
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,970


359
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,489
不是機械人

是電子人，電腦控制的生物
A cyborg. Cybernetic organism.

361
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,650


362

363
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,719
等一下
Just a second.

364
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,650


365
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,140
趴下

半人半機械

369
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,510
內部是一個超合金的戰鬥骨架

370
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,987
由微型處理器操作

371
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,950


372

全副武裝，非常強勁

373

但外表是活人組織

374
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,420


375
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,238
肌肉、皮膚、毛髮、血液
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...

376
00:41:36,238 --> 00:41:38,037
都是為電子人培植的

377
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,748
- 你想我怎樣做？ - 留心聽著
- Look, Reese, I don't know... - Pay attention.

378
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,208
我要丟棄這輛車

The 600-Series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.

但這批是新造的，它們很像人類
But these are new. They look human.

381
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:58,433
流汗、口臭，諸如此類 很難辨認
Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot.

I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him.

383

聽著…我不是蠢才.
Look, I am not stupid.

384
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:07,942
他們還不能製造那樣的東西
They cannot make things like that yet.

385
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,890


386
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,020


387
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,299
還不可以
Not yet.

388
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:12,155
40年後就可以了
Not for about 40 years.

389
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,090


390
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,701
你是說它來自未來？
Are you saying it's from the future?

391
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,953
一個有可能的未來
One possible future.

392
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,249
從你的角度看 我對科技一竅不通
From your point of view, I don't know tech stuff.

393
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,627
那麼你也是來自未來？
Then you're from the future, too. Is that right?

394
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,921
- 對  - 對

395

電子人感覺不到痛楚
Cyborgs don't feel pain.

397
00:42:39,778 --> 00:42:42,477
我感覺得到. 不要再那樣做.
I do. Don't do that again.

398
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,320


399
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,620


400
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,259
放我走
Just let me go.

401
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:46,481
聽著… 還有搞清楚點
Listen and understand.

402
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,560


403
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,401
那個終結者就在外面
That Terminator is out there.

404
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,468
它是沒情可講的
It can't be bargained with,

405
00:42:52,468 --> 00:42:54,238
也不講道理
it can't be reasoned with.

406
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,200


407
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,152
它不會感到可惜...
It doesn't feel pity...

408
00:42:57,152 --> 00:42:59,118
...或後悔或者恐懼，
...or remorse or fear

409
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,540


410
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,631
它絕不會罷休
and it absolutely will not stop,

411
00:43:02,631 --> 00:43:05,166
永遠不會, 直到你死掉.
ever, until you are dead.

412
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,340


413
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,140


414
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,220
你可否制止它？
Can you stop it?

415
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,809
我不知道
I don't know.

416
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,938
靠這些武器，我不知道
With these weapons, I don't know.

417
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,387
所有單位，灰色福特…
All units. Ford suspect vehicle...

418
00:43:45,387 --> 00:43:47,750
在一個停車場裡發現可疑車輛

419
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,760


420
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,430
地點是第四街和百老匯街交界

421
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,870
位置是下層

422
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,700
疑匪是個年約25歲，身高六呎 穿綠色外衣的白種男人

423
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,900
最後被發現在…

424
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,525
瑞斯？
Reese,

425
00:44:33,525 --> 00:44:35,673
為何是我？
why me?

426
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,540


427
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,302
它為何要對付我？
Why does it want me?

428
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:48,102
曾經發生了一場核戰
There was a nuclear war.

429
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,899
未來數年後…
A few years from now...

430
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,055
這裡的一切…
...all this,

這個地方，所有的東西…
this whole place, everything...

432
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,560


433

...都會消失.  就此消失.
...it's gone. Just gone.

434
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,830


435

有一些生還者
There were survivors.

436

零星的… 散落各地.

00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:10,740


438

沒有人知道是誰發動戰爭
Nobody even knew who started it.

439
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,547
是那些機器
It was the machines, Sarah.

440
00:45:20,547 --> 00:45:22,470
我不明白
I don't understand.

...接駁到所有的東西
...hooked into everything,

446
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,523
被委託操控一切的重任
trusted to run it all.

447
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,290


448
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,401
他們說它變得聰明起來
They say it got smart...

449
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,737
一種智慧的新秩序
a new order of intelligence.

450
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,670


451
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,074
它視所有人類為威脅
Then it saw all people as a threat.

452
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,659
不能與我們共存
Not just the ones on the other side.

453
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,455
它在剎那間決定了我們的命運
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

454
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,875
滅絕
Extermination.

455
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,766
你可有目睹這場戰爭？
Did you see this war?

456
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,126
沒有. 我在戰後長大.
No. I grew up after.

457
00:46:24,126 --> 00:46:25,992
在廢墟中成長
In the ruins.

458
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,510


459
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,050


460
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:29,203
挨飢抵餓. 躲避那些HK.
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

461
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,220


462
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,373
- HK？ - 追捕殺手
- H-Ks? - Hunter-killers.

463
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,294
機械工廠製造的巡邏機器
Patrol machines built in automated factories.

464
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,381
我們大部分人被圍捕
Most of us were rounded up,

465
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:40,715
關在營裡等候被逐一消滅
put in camps for orderly disposal.

466
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,160


467
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,052
這是被雷射掃瞄器烙下的
This was burned in by laser scanner.

468
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:52,550
我們有部分人得以活下來…
Some of us were kept alive.

469
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,561
負責…
To work.

470
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,170


471
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,896
搬運屍體
Loading bodies.

472
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,734
那些消滅單位日以繼夜地運作
The disposal units ran night and day.

473
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,778
我們差點就喪命
We were that close to going out forever.

474
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,767
但有一個人…
But there was one man...

475
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:09,744
教我們反抗，
...who taught us to fight.

476
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,660


477
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,829
衝擊監禁營的線路
To storm the wire of the camps.

478
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:15,291
把那些金屬混蛋撞個稀巴爛
To smash those metal motherfuckers into junk.

479
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,670
他扭轉了局勢，帶我們脫離險境
He turned it around. He brought us back from the brink.

480
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,544
他姓康納
His name was Connor.

481
00:47:22,544 --> 00:47:24,091
約翰康納
John Connor.

482
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,160


483
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,557
你的兒子
Your son, Sarah.

484
00:47:26,557 --> 00:47:28,721
你未出生的兒子
Your unborn son.

485
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,310


486
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,498
你來開車
Drive!

487
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,882
瑞斯!
Reese!

488

瑞斯!
Reese!

489
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,422
不，瑞斯，不
No, Reese. No, no,

490
00:49:49,422 --> 00:49:51,280
不，他們會殺死你的
no. They'll kill you.

491
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:51,280


492
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,283
在凱迪拉克車裡的人 立刻舉高雙手
You in the Cadillac, let me see your hands now.

493
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:58,454
下車
Get out of the car.

494
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,418
跪下
Drop to your knees.

495
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,786
下車
Out of the car.

496
00:50:05,786 --> 00:50:07,213
跪下
Drop to the ground.

497
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,590


498
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:14,140
所有PC- 207單位注意 疑匪已被制伏

499
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,940
取消進一步支援

500
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,906
莎拉…
Sarah. Sarah,

501
00:50:37,906 --> 00:50:40,454
喝一點吧
try to drink some of this.

502
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,730


503
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,626
你肯定是他們？
Listen, are you sure it's them?

504
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,587
我應該看看屍體的
I mean, maybe I should look at the bodies.

505
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,632
已經證實了他們的身分 沒有錯的
No. They've been identified and there's no doubt.

506
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,740
天

507
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,346
金珍
Ginger.

508
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:02,393
- 小伙子 - 莎拉...
- Kiddo. - Sarah...

509
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,780


510
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,936
這是西伯曼醫生
Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.

511
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:05,729
你好，莎拉
Hi, Sarah.

512
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:05,750


513
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,227
我想你告訴他，
I want you to tell him...

514
00:51:07,227 --> 00:51:08,763
瑞斯對你說的一切
...everything Reese told you.

515
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:09,942
你應付得來嗎？
Do you feel up to that?

516
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:12,130


517
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,194
可以吧
Yeah, I guess so.

518
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,660
你是個醫生？
You're a doctor?

519
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,825
犯罪學心理醫生
Criminal psychologist.

520
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,870


521
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,396
瑞斯是不是瘋了？
Is Reese crazy?

522
00:51:19,396 --> 00:51:22,204
我們就是要查證一下
That's what we're gonna find out.

523
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:23,430


524
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,300
你是個軍人吧
So you're a soldier.

525
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,918
保衛著誰？
Fighting for whom?

526
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,430


527
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,630
隸屬第132團，由貝里率領
With the 132nd under Perry.

528
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,466
由21年到27年
From '21 to '27.

529
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:57,630


530
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,719
那是…2027年？
That's the year 2027?

531
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,710


532
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,971
對. 後來我被派到…
That's right. Then I was assigned...

533
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:05,100


534
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,767
- 很好  -...當約翰康納的部下
- This is fucking great. - ...under John Connor.

535
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:06,750


536
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:10,020
- 敵人是誰？ - 一個電腦防衛系統…
- Who was the enemy? - A computer defense system built...

537
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,731
該死，對不起
Goddamn. Sorry.

538
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:16,235
電腦動力系統替薩諾力製造的
...built for SAC-NORAD by Cyberdyne Systems.

539
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,362
是吧
I see.

540
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,132
這個電腦…
And this computer...

541
00:53:20,132 --> 00:53:24,410
...以為殺了敵人的母親就可以勝利
...thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy.

542
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:24,190


543
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:27,788
把他在孕育前就殺掉
Killing him, in effect, before he's even conceived.

544
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,040
算是倒逆的墮胎？
A sort of retroactive abortion?

545
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:35,240


546
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,157
西伯曼笑死我了
Silberman cracks me up.

547
00:53:33,157 --> 00:53:35,087
那個傢伙把他弄得一頭霧水
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

548
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,756
- 他先弄得一團糟 - 閉嘴
- He screwed it first... - Ed, shut up.

549
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:38,850
那麼為何它…
Why didn't...

550
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,259
...不殺死約翰康納？
...the computer just kill Connor then?

551
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:42,720


552
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:42,970
為何要有這個終結者的計劃？
Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator?

553
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,638
我沒有選擇
It had no choice.

554
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,224
它們的防禦網絡被摧毀
Their defense grid was smashed.

555
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:47,150


556
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,353
我們贏了
We'd won.

557
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:51,812
殺掉約翰康納也不會有何分別
Taking out Connor then would make no difference.

558
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:51,660


559
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,773
天網要剷除他整個組織
Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence.

560
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,708
是不是當你們操控了實驗室時 找到的…
Is that when you captured the lab complex and found...

561
00:53:58,708 --> 00:53:59,987
...那個什麼？
...What is it called?

562
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,322
時空轉移裝置？
The time displacement equipment?

563
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,572
不錯
That's right.

564
00:54:03,572 --> 00:54:06,535
那個終結者已經穿越過來了
The Terminator had already gone through.

565
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:06,210


566
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,091
康納派我來攔截
Connor sent me to intercept

567
00:54:08,091 --> 00:54:09,580
它們把整個地方炸毀了
and they blew the whole place.

568
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,582
你怎麼回去？
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

569
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,168
我不可以
I can't.

570
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,955
沒有人可以回去
Nobody goes home.

571
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:21,258
沒有別人可以過來
Nobody else comes through.

572
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,320


573
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:25,095
只有他…和我
It's just him and me.

574
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:24,800


575
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,369
只有他… 和我
It's just him and me.

576
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,190


577
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:18,364
為何你沒有帶武器？
Why didn't you bring any weapons?

578
00:56:18,364 --> 00:56:20,419
一些更先進的武器？
Something more advanced.

579
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,310


580
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:23,547
你們沒有鐳射槍的嗎？
Don't you have ray guns?

581
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:24,700
鐳射槍.
Ray guns.

582
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,384
給我看看一件未來的科技
Show me a piece of future technology.

583
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:27,150


584
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,650
你要光著身體
You go naked.

585
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:31,930
它跟由生物產生的磁場有關
Something about the field generated by a living organism.

586
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,890


587
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,141
- 死物是不行的 - 為什麼？
- Nothing dead will go. - Why?

588
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,976
那鬼東西不是我製造的
I didn't build the fucking thing.

589
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:40,898
好的… 但這個電子人，若它是金屬的…
OK, OK. But this cyborg, if it's metal...?

590
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:40,260


591
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,090


592
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,862
被活組織包著的
Surrounded by living tissue.

593
00:56:42,862 --> 00:56:43,483
對，是的
Oh, right.

594
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,730


595
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:47,029
這可真有看頭 我可以因他功成名就
This is great stuff. I could make a career out of this guy.

596
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,990
看這個多聰明？不需要證據
See how clever it is? It doesn't require a shred of proof.

597
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,370
大部分神經病幻覺都很複雜
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,

598
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,619
但這個卻很精明
but this is brilliant.

599
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,019
為何另外那兩個女人會被殺？
Why were the other two women killed?

600
00:56:58,019 --> 00:56:59,917
大部分記錄都在戰爭中遺失了
Most records were lost in the war.

601
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,810


602
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,669
天網對康納的母親幾乎一無所知
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.

603
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,781
她的全名… 她住在哪裡
Her full name, where she lived.

604
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:06,256
他們只知道在哪個城市
They just knew the city.

605
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,190


606
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,509
那個終結者只是受系統操控
The Terminator was just being systematic.

607
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,747
我們再談談…
Let's go back...

608
00:57:10,747 --> 00:57:12,512
你聽夠了
Look, you have heard enough.

609
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,290


610
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,183
我已經回答了你的問題
I have answered your questions,

611
00:57:14,183 --> 00:57:15,641
現在我要見莎拉
now I have to see Sarah Connor.

612
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,885
我可不能作主
I'm afraid that's not up to me.

613
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:19,770
- 那為何我要跟你談？ - 因為…
Then why am I talking to you?

614
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,790


615
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,772
- 誰是主管？ - 求你…
- Who is in authority here? - Please...

616
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,482
閉嘴
Shut up!

617
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,860
你還是不明白，對不對？
You still don't get it, do you?

618
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,518
他會找到她的
He'll find her.

619
00:57:28,518 --> 00:57:30,406
他就是要那樣做
That's what he does.

620
00:57:30,406 --> 00:57:32,115
他只會那樣做
That's all he does.

621
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,100


622
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,040


623
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,034
你制止不了他的
You can't stop him.

624
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,922
他會宰了你，捏住她的喉嚨
He'll reach down her throat

625
00:57:35,922 --> 00:57:37,829
挖出她的心臟
and pull her fucking heart out!

626
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,958
- 醫生  - 放開我!
- Doc. - Let go of me!

627
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,380


628
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,420
對不起
Sorry.

629
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,219
瑞斯是瘋了？
So Reese is crazy?

630
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,750
用技術性的用語…
In technical terminology,

631
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:55,889
他是個瘋子
he's a loon.

632
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:55,730


633
00:57:56,723 --> 00:58:00,200
莎拉，這是他們所謂的盔甲
Sarah, this is what they call body armor.

634
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,187
我們的特種部隊都穿著這個
Our TAC guys wear these.

635
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:02,010


636
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,481
能擋12口徑的火力
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

637
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,858
那個人一定是穿了它
This other individual must've been wearing one under his coat.

638
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,694
觸摸一下吧
Feel that. Go ahead.

639
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,151
打碎擋風玻璃又怎樣解釋？
He punched through the windshield.

640
00:58:13,151 --> 00:58:14,574
他可能服食了麻醉藥
He was probably on PCP.

641
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,250


642
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,076
若他折斷了手
Broke every bone in his hand.

643
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,411
幾小時也感覺不到的
He wouldn't feel it for hours.

644
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,162
這個傢伙…看見嗎？
There was this guy once... You see this scar?

645
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,747
- 拿著. - 謝謝.
- Here. - Thank you.

646
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,050


647
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,178
這裡有一張沙發
There's a couch in this other room.

648
00:58:24,178 --> 00:58:25,919
躺下來睡一會吧
Stretch out and get some sleep.

649
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:28,200


650
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:26,875
你媽要一小時後才從大熊鎮抵達
Be at least an hour...

651
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:28,422
你媽要一小時後才從大熊鎮抵達
...before your mother gets here from Big Bear.

652
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,500
我睡不著
I can't sleep.

653
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,675
試試吧
Try.

654
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:31,600


655
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:36,096
那張沙發其貌不揚，但很舒服的
It may not look it, but that couch is very comfortable.

656
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:39,415
你會絕對安全的
You'll be perfectly safe.

657
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:41,893
這座大廈裡有30個警員
We got 30 cops in this building.

658
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,240


659
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,021
謝謝你
Thank you.

660
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,320
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

661
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:08,746
我是莎拉康納的朋友
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.

662
00:59:08,746 --> 00:59:09,955
我知道她在這裡
I was told she's here.

663
00:59:09,955 --> 00:59:10,797
我可否見她？
Could I see her?

664
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:13,110


665
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,133
不可以，她在錄口供
No. Can't see her. She's making a statement.

666
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,426
她在哪裡？
Where is she?

667
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,045
要一會兒的 你想等的話，
It may take a while. If you wanna wait,

668
00:59:17,045 --> 00:59:18,180
那邊有張長椅
there's a bench over there.

669
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:31,234
我會回來
I'll be back.

670
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,720
怎麼回事？

671
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,230
有槍聲

672
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,244
- 是不是恐怖分子？ - 快走
- Are they terrorists? - Let's go, let's go!

673
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:28,291
別走開
Stay here.

674
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,057
- 我們快離開這裡 - 來吧
Let's get outta here!

675
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:50,170
快點…

676
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:53,700
我看到他

677
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,624
看著他
Watch him.

678
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,150
- 自動式武器 - 快點，走吧

679
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,640
著火了…

680
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,818
艾特
Ed...

681
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,029
Hey!

682
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,182
莎拉
Sarah!

683
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:51,851
瑞斯
Reese.

684
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:56,940
這邊
This way.

685
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,400
新聞時間，4點36分
KFLB news time 4:36.

686
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:40,870

690
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,810


691
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:47,032
...執法行動正在展開

692
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:50,785
五個南部縣區正在大舉搜捕…

693
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,749
拿著
Take this.

694
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,545
我們把這個推離公路
All right, let's get this off the road.

695
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,049
你冷嗎？
You cold?

696
01:04:34,049 --> 01:04:35,413
凍僵了
Freezing.

697
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,660


698
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,553
瑞斯…
Reese?

699
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:56,184
- 你有名字嗎？  - 凱爾
- You got a first name? - Kyle.

700
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,790


701
01:04:56,351 --> 01:05:00,647
凱爾, 你穿越時空時是怎樣的？
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?

702
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,820


703
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,318
白光
White light.

704
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,114
痛楚
Pain.

705
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:15,463
或許就像出生時一樣吧
It's like being born maybe.

706
01:05:15,463 --> 01:05:16,663
我的天
Oh, my God.

707
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:16,140


708
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,499
我剛才吃了一記
I caught one back there.

709
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,842
你中槍了？
You mean you got shot?

710
01:05:22,842 --> 01:05:23,837
不是很嚴重
It's not bad.

711
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,680


712
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:28,174
- 我們要找醫生 - 沒事的，算了吧
- We gotta get you to a doctor. - It's OK. Forget it.

713
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:31,844
算了？你瘋了嗎？
What do you mean, forget it? Are you crazy?

714
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,012
脫下它
Take this off.

715
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:33,250


716
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,277
天啊
Jesus.

717
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:50,321
它穿過了皮肉
See? It passed right through the meat.

718
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,115
這會使我作嘔
This is gonna make me puke.

719
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:55,660
- 你可以跟我說嗎？ - 說什麼？
- Would you just talk about something? - What?

720
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:57,975
不知道，隨便說吧
I don't know. Anything. Just talk.

721
01:05:57,975 --> 01:05:59,289
談談我的兒子
Tell me about my son.

722
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,950


723
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,709
他有我這麼高大
He's about my height.

724
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,381
他有你的眼睛
He has your eyes.

725
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,303
他是怎樣的？
What's he like?

726
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,667
你信任他
You trust him.

727
01:06:15,667 --> 01:06:17,765
他有一種力量
He's got a strength.

728
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:18,160


729
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,352
我願意為約翰康納犧牲
I'd die for John Connor.

730
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:27,901
我現在至少知道給他取什麼名字
Well, at least now I know what to name him.

731
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:27,770


732
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,709
你不知道他父親是誰吧
Don't suppose you know who the father is...

733
01:06:31,709 --> 01:06:33,823
好讓我遇上他時不會叫他滾開
...so I won't tell him to get lost?

734
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:33,610


735
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,743
約翰從來沒有提起他
John never said much about him.

736
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,412
- 我知道他在戰前死了 - 等一會
- I know he dies before the war... - Wait.

737
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,124
我不想知道
I don't wanna know.

738
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,128
是不是約翰派你來的？
So was it John that sent you here?

739
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,380
是我自願的
I volunteered.

740
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:51,600
為什麼？
Why?

741
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,427
有機會認識傳奇人物
It was a chance to meet the legend.

742
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:54,610


743
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,752
莎拉康納
Sarah Connor,

744
01:06:57,752 --> 01:07:02,352
她教她的兒子抵抗…組織,
who taught her son to fight, organize,

745
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,950


746
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:02,310


747
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,604
準備，從他小時就開始教導他
prepare from when he was a kid.

748
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,814
當其他人還在戰前躲避時
When you were in hiding before the war.

749
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,437
你用過去式說一些
You're talking about things...

750
01:07:12,437 --> 01:07:14,364
我還沒有做的事
...I haven't done yet in the past tense.

751
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,407
真的令我發瘋
It's driving me crazy.

752
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:23,039
你肯定找對了人？
Are you sure you have the right person?

753
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,250
肯定
I'm sure.

754
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:29,128
不是吧，我像未來的母親？
Come on. Do I look like the mother of the future?

755
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,480
我堅強嗎？
I mean, am I tough?

756
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,802
有組織能力？ 我連讓自己收支平衡都不會
Organized? I can't even balance my checkbook.

757
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:36,240


758
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:42,725
我沒有要求這個榮譽 也不想要它
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it.

759
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,352
絕對不要
Any of it.

760
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,498
你兒子要我告訴你
Your son gave me a message to give to you.

761
01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:51,859
他要我背熟它
Made me memorize it.

762
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,730


763
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,905
「感謝你在黑暗年代的勇氣」
"Thank you, Sarah, for your courage through the dark years.

764
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,199
「你要面對的事我幫不到你...
I can't help you with what you must soon face,

765
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,660
...只能說未來還未定案」
except to say the future is not set.

766
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:03,329
「你一定要比你想像中更堅強」
You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.

767
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,999
「你一定要活下去 否則我永遠不會存在」
You must survive or I will never exist."

768
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,793
就是這樣
That's all.

769
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,298
包紮得很好
It's a good field dressing.

770
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,342
你喜歡嗎？
You like it?

771
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,511
這是我的第一次
It's my first.

772
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,184
睡一會吧，快天亮了
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.

773
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,690
好的
OK.

774
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,286
再跟我談一會
Talk to me some more.

775
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,082
談什麼？
About what?

776
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,419
告訴我你從哪裡來
Tell me about where you're from.

777
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,381
好的
All right.

778
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,117
你白天躲藏起來
You stay down by day,

779
01:08:59,117 --> 01:09:01,804
但在晚上你可以到處活動
but at night you can move around.

780
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:01,590


781
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:05,892
你仍然要小心 因為追捕殺手會用紅外線
You still have to be careful because the H-Ks use infrared.

782
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:10,342
但它們不是太聰明
But they're not too bright.

783
01:09:10,342 --> 01:09:13,066
約翰教我們對付它們的方法
John taught us ways to dust them.

784
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,510


785
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,778
就是當那些滲透者出現的時候
That's when the infiltrators started to appear.

786
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,988
終結者是最新型的…
The Terminators were the newest.

787
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:20,531
最難對付的
The worst.

788
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:33,034
它正在以搜尋模式闖進你的防區
Traversing your sector in search mode.

789
01:09:33,034 --> 01:09:35,171
在你以北750米的位置
750 meters north of your position.

790
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,590


791
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,260
我們走吧
Let's go.

792
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,643
瑞斯，DN- 384…
Reese. DN384...

793
01:10:28,643 --> 01:10:30,685
對，讓他進來
Right. Let himin.

794
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,950


795
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:43,270
我們的監察者有一隻爪壞了 所以要減少巡邏

796
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:47,600
收到，揚基17，你可以安全折返

797
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:04,070
終結者…
Terminator!

798
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,649
我夢見一些狗
I was dreaming about dogs.

799
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:27,278
我們用牠們來提防終結者
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

800
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,907
你的世界很可怕
Your world is pretty terrifying.

801
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:13,616
老友，你裡面有隻死貓嗎？
Hey, buddy, you got a dead cat in there or what?

802
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:19,550
（可能的回應：是、不是或走開）

803
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:20,740
（去你的，混蛋）

804
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:23,125
去你的，混蛋
Fuck you, asshole.

805
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:34,460
（媽媽的小屋 大熊鎮雲杉路181號）

806
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,813
該死
God damn.

807
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,357
謝謝
Thank you.

808
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,510
（迪基旅館）

809
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,239
這個夠不夠？
Is this enough?

810
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:57,076
夠了，我不想問你從哪裡得來的
Yeah, it's enough. I don't wanna ask where you got it.

811
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:04,917
- 來了 - 我們要一個房間
- I'm coming. - We need a room.

812
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:07,086
- 好的 - 要有廚房
- All right. - With a kitchen.

813
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,713
有廚房的嗎？
Do you have one with a kitchen?

814
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,606
我很想洗澡
I am dying for a shower.

815
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:31,402
還要檢查你的繃帶
We should check your bandage, too.

816
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:34,655
稍後吧，我要出去買東西
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

817
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,536
拿著這個
Keep this.

818
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:08,728
媽，我不能告訴你我在哪裡
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.

819
01:16:08,728 --> 01:16:09,982
有人叫我不要說出來
I was told not to say.

820
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:12,090


821
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:12,318
我要知道在哪裡可以找到你
But I need to know where to reach you.

822
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:15,015
你叫我像個逃犯般躲在小屋裡
You tell me to hide out at the cabin

823
01:16:15,015 --> 01:16:17,615
但你卻不願告訴我發生什麼事？
and you won't tell me what's going on?

824
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,600


825
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:20,534
我很擔心
I am worried sick here.

826
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:24,455
好吧. 這是電話號碼.
OK. OK, here's the number.

827
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,640


828
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,832
- 準備好了嗎？ - 準備好了，說吧
- You ready? - Yes. Go ahead.

829
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:31,304
是408-555…1439
It's 408-555-1439.

830
01:16:31,304 --> 01:16:33,672
九號房，
Room nine.

831
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,370


832
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,480


833
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,591
- 記下了嗎？ - 記下了.
- Got it? - I've got it.

834
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:36,590


835
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:36,684
我要掛了
I gotta go.

836
01:16:36,684 --> 01:16:39,929
抱歉我現在不能多說
I'm sorry I can't tell you more right now.

837
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:39,660


838
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:41,847
媽，我愛你
I love you, Mom.

839
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:47,228
我也愛你
I love you, too, sweetheart.

840
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,535
- 迪基旅館 - 把你們的地址給我
- Tiki Motel. - Give me your address there.

841
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:07,289
買了什麼？
What have we got?

842
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:13,278
樟腦丸…
Mothballs...

843
01:17:13,278 --> 01:17:15,731
玉米糖漿
corn syrup...

阿摩尼亞
ammonia.

845
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,220


846
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,890


847
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,926
晚餐吃什麼？
What's for dinner?

848
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,721
- 塑料炸彈 - 好極了
- Plastique. - That sounds good.

849
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,265
這是什麼？
What is it?

850
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:27,090
硝酸甘油固定劑
It's a nitroglycerin base.

851
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:28,727
這樣會固定一點
It's a bit more stable.

852
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:30,940


853
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,771
我小時候學會的
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

854
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,785
不要沾到引線上
Make sure there's none on the threads.

855
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,414
這樣
Like this.

856
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,168
把蓋扭上
Screw the end cap on.

857
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,629
輕輕的
Very gently.

858
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,676
你的童年一定很好玩
You must've had a fun childhood.

859
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:05,764
很好
That's good.

860
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:09,768
再多做六個，我會開始做信管
All right. Six more like that and I'll get started on the fuses.

861
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,199
他會找到我們，是不是？
He'll find us, won't he?

862
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,703
可能吧
Probably.

863
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:47,932
這件事永遠不會完結，對嗎？
It'll never be over, will it?

864
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:58,359
看看我，我在顫抖
Look at me. I'm shaking.

865
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,038
好一個傳奇人物
Some legend.

866
01:19:01,038 --> 01:19:04,657
你一定很失望了
You must be pretty disappointed.

867
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,700


868
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:09,662
不是.  我沒有失望.
No, I'm not.

869
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,800


870
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:23,676
凱爾,  你那個時代的女人…
Kyle, the women in your time,

871
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:23,290


872
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:25,928
她們是怎樣的？
what are they like?

873
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,099
是精銳的戰士
Good fighters.

874
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,309
我不是那個意思
That's not what I meant.

875
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:36,313
有沒有意中人？
Was there someone special?

876
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:39,900
意中人？
Someone...?

877
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,695
女孩子
A girl, you know.

878
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,572
沒有
No.

879
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:49,994
從來沒有
Never.

880
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,205
從來沒有？
Never?

881
01:19:58,168 --> 01:19:59,727
我很難過
I'm sorry.

882
01:19:59,727 --> 01:20:01,547
我真的很難過
I'm so sorry.

883
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:01,760


884
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:06,510
這麼多痛苦
So much pain.

885
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:10,101
痛苦是可以抑制的
Pain can be controlled.

886
01:20:10,101 --> 01:20:12,224
只要你不去想它
You just disconnect it.

887
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,200


888
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:14,643
那麼你沒有感覺？
So you feel nothing?

889
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,735
約翰康納曾經把你一張照片給我
John Connor gave me a picture of you once.

890
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:26,447
當時我不明白原因
I didn't know why at the time.

891
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:31,296
它很舊了
It was very old,

892
01:20:31,296 --> 01:20:33,746
有點破爛, 也褪色了.
torn, faded.

893
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:32,050


894
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,980


895
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:40,779
你當時很年輕，像現在一樣
You were young like you are now.

896
01:20:40,779 --> 01:20:43,589
你看來…  有點悲傷.
You seemed just a little sad.

897

01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:47,885
我時常猜想你當時在想著什麼
I used to always wonder what you were thinking at that moment.

900
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:51,555
我謹記著每一條線…
I memorized every line...

901
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,933
每一條曲線
...every curve.

902
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,522
莎拉，我穿越了時空來找你
I came across time for you, Sarah.

903
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:06,737
我愛你.  我一直愛著你.
I love you. I always have.

904
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:06,580


905
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,465
我不該那樣說的
I shouldn't have said that.

906
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:58,557
想快點
Think fast.

907
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:29,940
交換位置
Trade places.

908
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:44,288
快點!  開快點!
Faster! Drive faster!

909
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:44,440


910

凱爾!  我的天.
Kyle! Oh, my God.

911
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,250


912
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:12,959
凱爾.
Kyle.

913
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:28,910


914
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:29,601
混蛋
Son-of-a-bitch!

915
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:46,284
你別走開
You stay here.

916
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:11,435
我們快離開…
Let's get outta here.

917
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:16,356
下車
Get out.

918
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:36,460
凱爾，站起來
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

919
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:44,480
幫我

920
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,554
來吧
Kyle, come on.

921
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,450


922
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:51,558
幫我!  快走…
Help me! Get out. Get out.

923
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:51,430


924
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,290
走

925
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:11,840
快點

926
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:18,001
不要停，走
Don't stop. Run!

927

01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:34,387
凱爾

929

凱爾. 凱爾..
Kyle. Kyle...

凱爾，我們成功了
We did it, Kyle.

931

我們成功了
We got him.

932
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,060

等一會
Wait.

936
01:32:11,735 --> 01:32:13,361
你幹什麼？
What are you doing?

937
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:17,407
掩護，讓它追蹤不到我們
Cover, so he can't track us.

（啟動自動化生產序列）

快點! 來吧.
Come on! Come on.

940
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:30,000


941

不，凱爾

來吧
Come on!

943
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:33,930


944
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,634
- 來吧 - 別理會我
- Come on! - Leave me here.

945
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:49,614
快走，瑞斯
Move it, Reese!

946
01:32:49,614 --> 01:32:52,150
站起來，士兵
On your feet, soldier!

947
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:52,260


948
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:54,652
站起來
On your feet!

949
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:56,446
快走
Move it!

950
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:09,811
後面，去後面
Get back. Go back.

951
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:46,139
- 莎拉，快逃 - 不
- Run, Sarah. - No.

952

快跑
Run!

01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:53,021
快跑
Run!

954
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:55,148
來吧，混蛋
Come on, motherfucker.

955
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:50,305
不…
No.

956
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:50,190

959

凱爾
Kyle.

960
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:13,627
11月10日，第7卷
Tape seven. November 10.

961
01:40:13,627 --> 01:40:14,926
我說到哪裡？
Where was I?

962
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:14,860


963
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:18,016
最難決定的是該告訴你什麼
What's most difficult is trying to decide...

964
01:40:18,016 --> 01:40:19,722
最難決定的是該告訴你什麼
...what to tell you and what not to.

965
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:21,861
但到你長大明白時
But I guess I have a while...

966
01:40:21,861 --> 01:40:24,435
我還有時間考慮
...before you're old enough to understand these tapes.

967
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:26,453
現在這是我的問題
They're more for me at this point...

968
01:40:26,453 --> 01:40:28,356
讓我想個清楚
...just so that I can get it straight.

969
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:06,811
加滿它
Fill her up.

970
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:13,609
我是否該告訴你 關於你父親的事？
Should I tell you about your father?

971
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:13,560


972
01:41:13,776 --> 01:41:16,028
那是個難題
Boy, that's a tough one.

973
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:20,285
你知道他是你的父親
Will it affect your decision to send him here,

974
01:41:20,285 --> 01:41:22,076
可會影響你派他來這裡的決定？
knowing that he is your father?

975
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:27,081
如果你不派凱爾來，就不會有你
If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.

976
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:30,334
天，想著這件事會使人發瘋的
God, a person could go crazy thinking about this.

977
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:35,881
我相信我會告訴你的
I suppose I will tell you.

978
01:41:37,717 --> 01:41:39,510
這是我至少該做的
I owe him that.

979
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:44,265
如果你知道這個…
Maybe it'll help if...

980
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:46,560
也許有幫助的
...you know that in the few hours that we had together...

981
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,854
在我們共處的時光裡…
...you know that in the few hours that we had together...

982
01:41:51,522 --> 01:41:53,941
我們愛了一生一世
...we loved a lifetime's worth.

983
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:08,452
他說什麼？
What did he just say?

984
01:42:08,452 --> 01:42:10,666
他說：「小姐，你很漂亮」
He says you're very beautiful.

985
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:10,580


986
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:11,931
他不敢問你拿五元的照相費
He is ashamed to ask you...

987
01:42:11,931 --> 01:42:13,711
他不敢問你拿五元的照相費
...for five American dollars for this picture.

988
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:17,298
但如果他不問你 他父親就會打他
But if he doesn't, his father will beat him.

989
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:17,120


990
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:19,175
孩子，真會做生意
Pretty good hustle, kid.

991
01:42:36,525 --> 01:42:38,110
他說什麼？
What did he just say?

992
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:40,946
他說風暴快來了
He said there's a storm coming in.

993
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:46,952
我知道
I know.
