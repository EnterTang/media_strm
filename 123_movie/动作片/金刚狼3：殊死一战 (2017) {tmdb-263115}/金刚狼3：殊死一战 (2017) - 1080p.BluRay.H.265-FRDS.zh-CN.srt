1
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,790
卸了轮子 拿了钱就走
We get the wheels, we get la Feria,

2
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,750
别捅娄子
we keep moving on. No messing around.

3
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,030
这次再把轮子搞坏
You mess those wheels up this time, Chong,

4
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,060
我一定要你们好看

00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,730
把收音机关掉
Turn down the radio.

9
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,330
你想把警察引来还是想怎样
You inviting the cops, too, or what?

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,460
我要些铬

00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,060
这些螺帽全是镀铬的 都被你们磨坏了
Those are chrome-plated lugs. You're gonna strip them.

16
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,390
看看这家伙
Look at this guy, eh?

17
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,060
镀层都被你们刮花了
The plating flakes off.

18
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,330
是吗？
Yeah?

19
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,340
这车是租来的 没人会花钱开一辆...
This is a lease. No one's gonna pay to ride...

20
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,940
找死 继续干活儿

21
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,650
该死
Shit.

22

25
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,190
伙计们 说真的 你们会后悔的
Guys, seriously, you don't wanna do this.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,200
摆平他
Take him out.

37
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,290
所有人都睡了 伯特
Everyone's asleep, Burt.

38
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,580
或者在梦游 就像冰川融化
Sleepwalking. Between the ice caps,

39
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,660
色情小说作家 有毒的水源 变种人
the pornographers, poisoned water, mutants...

40
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,490
其实他们都有联系
it's all connected.

41
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,660
嘿 克莱德 都已经2029年了
Hey, Clyde. It's 2029.

42
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,260
为什么我们还要提起变种人
Why are we still talking about mutants?

43
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,030
是我 我在车上
Hey, it's me. I'm in the car.

45
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,160
干完就走人
Killed it up and down the fence.

46
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,840

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,710
- 见鬼  - 请别走
- Oh, fuck.  - Please!

51
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,410
我有事相求
I'm in trouble!

52
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,680
你是唯一能帮我们的人
You're the only one that could help!

53
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,620
我需要像你这样的英雄

54
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,650
有多远给我滚多远
Get the fuck away from me!

55
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,870
你到底经历了什么？

56
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,850
为什么要躲起来

57
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,190
求你了
Please!

58
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,260
罗根
Logan!

59
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,540
那人是谁
Who was that?

60
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,570
不知道哪儿来的疯女人 不必担心
I don't know, some crazy lady. Don't worry.

61
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,560
真是百闻不如一见 金刚狼
As I live and breathe, the Wolverine.

62
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,830
可惜他成了瘾君子
And he's a junkie now.

63
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,440
你又是谁
Who the fuck are you?

64
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,110
你车门上怎么有弹孔啊
You know, you got some buckshot in your door.

65
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,980
我听说你在凤凰城
I heard you was in Phoenix.

66
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,980
可昨晚我德州的朋友
But then, last night, some friends of mine

67
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
打来电话
in Texas HP called...

68
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,650
说在54号公路旁的
and told me they found

69
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,950
水塘里发现3具墨西哥人的尸体
three dead cholos in a pullout on 54.

70
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,250
很平常 对吧
Not unusual, I know.

71
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,930
不过有具少只手 还有具少只腿
Except one was missing a hand, another one a leg.

72
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,500
这让他们觉得
So they was thinking...

73
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,690
可能是脱逃的老虎 或者《猛鬼街》里的佛瑞迪干的
it was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger.

74
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,270
可是他们不可能会开车啊
But neither one of them can drive...

75
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,440
一个是电影虚构的 另一个已经灭绝了
one being fictional, the other one extinct.

76
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,770
而且他们找到的车轮防滑钉
And since the wheel lugs they found

77
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,780
是克莱斯勒上的
belonged to a '24 Chrysler...

78
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,150
刚好
and, well...

79
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,510
你开的就是克莱斯勒
this is a '24 Chrysler.

80
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,450
她找到你了吗
She found you yet?

81
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,780
加芙列拉
Gabriela?

82
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,050
听着
See...

83
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,730
我要找的不是你 狼叔
I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.

84
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,290
确切的说我要找的人
Well, not really. I'm looking for someone

85
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,690
恰巧在找你
who's looking for you.

86
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,730
她趁我不注意时带走了我的一样东西
She took something of mine when I wasn't looking.

87
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,700
一样我要担责任的东西
Something for which I am responsible.

88
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,470
一个墨西哥女人
Mexican lady.

89
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,340
她正在找你
Has her sights on you now.

90
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,170
没想起什么吗
Doesn't ring any bells?

91
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,870
我不认识什么加芙列拉 所以赶紧给我滚
I don't know any Gabriela, so get the fuck out of my car.

92
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,020
知道吗
You know...

93
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,720
我知道你把谁藏了起来 朋友
I know what you're hiding, amigo.

94
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,990
你把老光头藏在了墨西哥边境
The old cue ball south of the border.

95
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,890
你想怎么样
What do you want?

96
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,650
我只想你合作
A little co-operation.

97
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,600
差点忘了 你是我的偶像
I'm a fan, by the way.

98
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,850
阿尔卡利 基因改造研究所
安全部主任 唐纳德·皮尔斯

99
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,350
该死 该死
Fuck, fuck!

100
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,780
不 爱斯佩兰萨先生 不
No, Mr. Esperanza, no.

101
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,920
是说好六月 可我现在就需要那艘船
I know I said June, but I need the boat now.

102
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,590
为什么这样就得涨价
Why would that mean the price go up?

103
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,850
听着
Listen to me.

104
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,860
我知道你想要7万
I know you wanted 70...

105
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,380
好吧 如果我能一次性给你
Okay, what if I could put together

106
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,370
4万5现金呢
$45,000 cash right now?

107
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,090
喂 喂
Hello? Hello?

108
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,400
见鬼
Shit.

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,020
你即将离开美国境内

110
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,870
嘿 山姆
Hey, Sam.

111
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
早上好
Morning.

112
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,080
莎士比亚《尤利乌斯·凯撒》

113
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,360
我知道您有那样内心的美德 勃鲁托斯
"I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus.

114
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,000
正像我知道您的外貌一样
"As well as I do know your outward favor.

115
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,460
好 光荣正是我的谈话的题目
"Well, honor is the subject of my story."

116
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,100
他今天情况不太好
He's having a bad day.

117
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,630
哪天情况好过了
They're all bad days.

118
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,640
六个小时前他就该服药了
He needed these six hours ago.

119
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,670
你知道这些根本不够
This is not enough, you know.

120
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,140
一星期都撑不过
Won't see us through the week.

121
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,470
我会想办法的
I'm working on it.

122
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,850
轮到你了
Your turn.

123
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,110
我都折腾了一晚上了
I've had a rough night.

124
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,810
好吧 你可以的
Poor you.

125
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,290
还有件事 他昨晚和我说
In other news, he told me last night

126
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,680
他在和某个人神交
he's communicating with someone.

127
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,730
没人和他神交
He's not talking to anybody.

128
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,160
话别说那么绝对
Don't be so sure.

129
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,340
他还交代了很多细节
He's got all these details.

130
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,060
我还以为那个蓄水箱能把他隔绝起来
I thought that tank was supposed to act as a barrier.

131
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,740
- 可他发作起来根本不管用  - 求你消停会儿
- It's got them cracks in it.  - Just please stop.

132
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,410
左边下面
Bottom left.

133
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,450
你没在听我说话
You're not listening.

134
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,920
他又开始不停地问问题了 问为什么我们会在这儿
He's been asking questions again about why we're here.

135
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,710
我觉得他还想钻进我的意识里
I think he's trying to read my mind.

136
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,190
所以我们才要给他喂药
That's what these are for.

137
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,390
他正吃着奶油点心
Eating his curds and whey

138
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,220
然后一只大蜘蛛出现 坐在了她的旁边
Then came a big spider Which sat down beside her

139
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,590
吓了玛菲特小姐一跳
And frightened Miss Muffet...

140
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,210
朋友们 我有个好消息要告诉你们
Friends, I have good news for you today!

141
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,780
你们做什么并不重要
It's not about what you do.

142
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,920
做什么也不重要
It's not about your deeds.

143
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,490
你们只是无法按照
You can't live up to God's rules.

144
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,650
上帝的旨意而活 没关系 我们并非完人
He knows that you can't. It's okay, we're imperfect.

145
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,420
请让一下 先生
Make way, sir.

146
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,760
我说了让开
I said make way!

147
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,060
来自塔可钟快餐店的新墨西哥鸡肉卷
The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell!

148
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,570
加一份鸡肉 加一份牛排
Get it with chicken! Get it with steak!

149
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,800
还有包裹着浓郁芝士在火上慢烤的饼皮
And with the cheese baked right in the shell...

150
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,740
新一季的明星产品
it's the next big thing!

151
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,910
还不快来抢
Go now while supplies last.

152
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,810
你是谁
Who are you?

153
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,510
你知道我是谁
You know who I am.

154
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,010
你是那个总让我睡觉的家伙
You're the man who puts me to sleep.

155
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,410
我们都需要睡会儿
We both could use some sleep.

156
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,980
不 拿开 快拿开
No! No!

157
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,590
你想对我做什么
What are you doing to me?

158
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,790
查尔斯
Charles.

159
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,130
别这样
Come on, now.

160
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,310
我待在这儿多久了
How long have I been here?

161
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,060
这是什么
What are these?

162
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,540
你知道这是什么
You remember what they are.

163
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,500
打针可以缓解痉挛
The shots mellow the seizures.

164
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,230
按时吃药就不会发作了
The pills keep them from happening.

165
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,370
不如你吹口仙气 愿上帝保佑吧
How about you blow on them to make them safe?

166
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,670
去你的 罗根
Fuck off, Logan.

167
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,340
所以你想起来我是谁了
So you remember who I am now.

168
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,840
我一直都知道你是谁
I always know who you are.

169
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,510
只是有的时候没认出来而已
It's just sometimes I don't recognize you.

170
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,840
快吃药吧
Take the pills.

171
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,420
你把我一个人丢给那个有白化病的家伙
You leave me alone with that fucking albino.

172
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,060
他根本不听我说话
He doesn't listen to me.

173
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,360
我一看就知道他们是新的物种
I know a damn speciation when I see one.

174
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
什么
A what?

175
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,720
新的物种 新的变种人 很年轻
Speciation. New mutant, a young one.

176
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,750
有势力想要屠杀他们
There are forces trying to kill them.

177
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,570
- 势力  - 他们需要帮助
- Forces?  - They want help.

178
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,240
势力 势力
Forces, forces.

179
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,770
可惜你已经退出历史舞台了
It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.

180
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,540
他们需要的不是我 而是你
They don't want me, they want you.

181
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,120
好吧 他们还真是愚不可及
Oh, yes, that's how fucking stupid they are.

182
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,120
他们在自由女神像那儿等着你
They're waiting for you at the Statue of Liberty.

183
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,480
自由女神像早就没了
The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago,

184
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,920
查尔斯 都已经多少年了
Charles, a long time.

185
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,090
早就没有新的变种人了 明白吗
There are no new mutants. Understand?

186
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,460
已经有25年没有新的变种人出生了
Hasn't been a new one born in 25 years. Not anywhere.

187
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,070
你总是以为
You always thought...

188
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,900
我们是上帝计划的一部分
we were part of God's plan.

189
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
或许吧
But maybe...

190
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,470
又或者我们是上帝犯下的错误
Maybe we were God's mistake.

191
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,020
你太让我失望了
What a disappointment you are.

192
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,090
当年我找到你的时候
When I found you...

193
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,100
你还只是个做困兽之斗的拳手
you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter.

194
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,490
这对于杀手来说已经是个不错的归宿了
A warm capper to a life as an assassin.

195
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,870
靠嗑药为生
Hooked on barbiturates.

196
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,300
当时的你就是个野兽
You were an animal.

197
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,010
是我们接纳了你
But we took you in.

198
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,770
给了你一个温馨的家
I gave you a family.

199
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,270
可现在都没了
And they're gone now.

200
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
罗根
Logan.

201
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,850
罗根
Logan...

202
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,490
你到底做了什么
What did you do?

203
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,160
你到底做了什么
What did you do?

204
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,390
回答我 为什么我们会在这儿
Answer me! Why are we here?

205
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,330
这不是我该过的生活
No one should live like this.

206
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,900
在这破水箱里被药物麻痹
Drugged in a fucking tank!

207
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,360
- 这是为了你好  - 不 不对 这不是为了我好
- It's for your own good.  - No, it's not!

208
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,040
你只是在等我死
You're waiting for me to die.

209
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,640
我不想吵架
I don't wanna fight...

210
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,440
但有些事情总得商量着解决
but there's things we need to discuss.

211
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,840
什么事
What things?

212
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,180
好吧 你别嫌我唠叨
Well, would it be considered nagging...

213
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,690
我之前就已经和你说过了
if I was to repeat my previous observation...

214
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,450
这些剂量太少了 没法抑制他的痉挛
that the dose is too low to suppress the seizures?

215
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,190
那家伙就给我这些
It's what the guy gave me.

216
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,660
我没什么资格讨价还价
Wasn't in a position to make demands.

217
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,200
今早我差点就死在这儿了
I almost died this morning.

218
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,010
- 每次他一发作  - 连一分钟都没到
- That seizure was...  - It was barely a minute.

219
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,150
感觉根本不止一分钟 我都无法呼吸了
It felt a lot longer than a minute. I couldn't breathe.

220
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,470
你受到的影响比我小
You're less affected.

221
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,500
你知道该增加剂量了
You know he needs a higher dose.

222
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,440
我还知道你藏了不少钱
And I know you got more money squirreled away.

223
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,890
那些钱是用来带我们离开这里的
That money's to get us out of here.

224
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,640
不 不是我们 是你和他
No, not us. You and him.

225
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,440
你想买一艘“逐日号”游艇
You're saving to buy a Sunseeker.

226
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,950
“日”字是关键
"Sun" is the keyword.

227
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,310
我不觉得自己能像不死僵尸那样一辈子躲在船舱里
I hardly see myself cowering below decks like Nosferatu.

228
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
不是吗
Do you?

229
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,390
在那儿叠着你的短裤 给他做葡萄干布丁
Folding your underpants, and making him spotted dick.

230
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,800
在你口袋里找到的
Found this in your pocket.

231
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,860
艾德曼合金
Adamantium.

232
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,310
如果你想让自己的脑袋开花
If you are planning to blow your brains out...

233
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,150
请到了公海再动手吧
could you wait till you're out on the high seas?

234
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,830
- 我刚把地板拖干净  - 别和我说这些废话
- I just mopped these floors.  - I don't need this shit.

235
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,920
一年前 你找我来帮忙
A year ago, you asked me to help you.

236
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,880
我发誓我尽力了
And God knows I've tried.

237
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,650
可如果你不肯对我说出实情的话
But I can't help you, Logan, not really...

238
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,320
我想我没法帮到你
if you're not going to talk to me.

239
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,990
你晚上总是不睡觉 我能听见
I hear you at night. You're not sleeping.

240
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,830
你不想和我谈谈吗
You don't wanna talk about that.

241
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,740
还有你喝酒的事
Or the booze you're drinking.

242
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,770
还有手指间被你擦掉的脓水
Or the pus you're wiping away from your knuckles.

243
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,880
或者我洗衣服时看到的血迹
Or the blood I wash from your clothes.

244
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,410
又或者你胸口上的新伤口
Or the fresh wounds in your chest.

245
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,870
那些没有愈合的伤口
The ones that aren't healing.

246
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,450
以及我很肯定
And I'm pretty sure...

247
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,700
你已经看不清
you don't wanna talk about the fact

248
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,590
瓶子上的标签了
that you can't read the label on that bottle.

249
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,450
上面写的是布洛芬
It says, "Ibuprofen."

250
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,750
那是我最喜欢的马克杯
That was my favorite mug.

251
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,090
不用你多管闲事
Stay out of my shit.

252
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,700
我知道你出问题了 罗根
Something's happening to you, Logan.

253
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,460
在你的体内 你病了 我闻得出来
On the inside you're sick. I can smell it.

254
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,470
这是我最嗨的一晚
Best night ever!

255
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,940
司机大叔
Hey, driver.

256
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,490
我爱你 我也爱你
I love you. I love you.

257
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,330
你太可爱了
You're such a doll.

258
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,600
两名乘客 自由汽车旅馆

259
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,660
罗根先生
Mr. Logan.

260
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,860
天啊
Oh, Jesus.

261
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,620
求你了 我们需要搭车
Please. We need a ride.

262
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,700
我没空 叫出租车吧
Not available. Call a cab.

263
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,940
我叫加芙列拉·洛佩兹
My name is Gabriela Lopez.

264
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,150
我不想知道 女士
I don't wanna know your name, lady.

265
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,570
有人在追杀我们
There are men after us.

266
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,250
我们必须离开这儿
We need to get out of here.

267
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,970
往北走 去加拿大
Go north, cross to Canada.

268
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,700
这活儿谁都能干
Anyone can do that job.

269
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,910
我可以给你5万美元
I'll give you $50,000.

270
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,140
你是怎么找到我的
How did you find me, huh?

271
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,810
你带给我的麻烦已经够多的了
'Cause you are fucking up my life, lady!

272
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,210
追你们的那帮人现在盯上我了
The people after you, they're on my ass now!

273
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,480
你被人认出来了
Sightings were posted.

274
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,920
- 劳拉 到里面去  - 被谁认出来了
- Laura, go inside.  - What sightings?

275
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,930
有人说看到一个长得很像金刚狼的人
People said someone who looked like the Wolverine

276
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,930
在厄尔巴索当司机
was in El Paso, driving.

277
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,680
还说他看上去老了
Said he looked old.

278
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,930
嘿
Hey!

279
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,070
我警告过你别再玩那个球了
I told you to stop it with that ball!

280
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,330
- 你这个臭丫头  - 不 求你了
- Bad girl!  - No, please.

281
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,060
- 我警告过你 臭丫头  - 不 求你了
- I told you, bad girl!  - No, please.

282
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,350
你可得赔钱给我
Mamacita's gonna have to pay for that.

283
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,370
求你了 别说了
Stop, please. No.

284
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
见鬼
Shit!

285
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,560
他们得赔偿我的损失
They're gonna have to pay for damages.

286
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,350
她身上有钱
And she has cash.

287
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,550
我看到的
I've seen it.

288
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,430
带着你的肥臀滚回你的办公室
You should get your fat ass back in your office.

289
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,450
她会赔你钱的
You'll get your money.

290
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,290
别让她打给任何人了 求你了
Don't let her call anyone, please.

291
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,520
他们会找到我们的 然后杀了我们
They will find us. They will kill us.

292
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,070
我是名护士
I am a nurse.

293
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,770
曾经是 在墨西哥城
Was. In Mexico City.

294
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,370
什么时候受伤的
When did that happen?

295
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,940
今天早上 在边界处
This morning. Near the border.

296
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,910
我逃了出来 不过
I got away from them, but...

297
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,950
由于缺少新生变种人 研究人员备受困扰
水中是否被添加了某种物质

298
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,020
基因改造
儿科癌症研究

299
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,290
现在他们认得我的车了
now they know my car.

300
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,320
听着 我得走了
Look, I gotta go.

301
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,720
不 等等 求你了
No, wait. Please. Here.

302
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,290
等等 快看
Please, wait! Look.

303
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,160
给你 你拿着 这里是2万美元
Look. Here, take this. It's $20,000.

304
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,500
拿着 带我们去上面的地址
Here. Take us to this address.

305
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,130
等你到了那儿我再给你3万
You can have $30,000 more when we get there.

306
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,570
我朋友到时候会给你
My friends there will give it to you.

307
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,510
他们在等我们
They will be waiting.

308
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,980
你要什么他们都会给你的
They will give you anything.

309
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,240
这些钱哪儿来的
Where did you get this?

310
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,750
我男朋友的
My boyfriend.

311
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,250
他想要杀了我 然后带走她
He wants to kill me and take her.

312
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,950
那是你女儿
And that's your daughter?

313
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
是的
Yes.

314
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,100
我知道你是个好人
I know you're still good inside.

315
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,380
我知道你会帮我们的
I know you want to help us.

316
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,480
你根本不了解我
You don't know anything about me.

317
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,510
求你了
Please!

318
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,840
我保证 如果现在就走的话 不会有事的
I promise, there will be no problems if we leave now.

319
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,870
我不能就这么离开去北达科他州
I can't just leave to North Dakota!

320
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,640
- 我们必须周五前赶到那儿  - 否则怎样
- We have to be there Friday.  - Or what?

321
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,310
否则我们就没法过境
Or we miss our chance to cross.

322
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,940
求你了
Please.

323
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,140
帮帮我们 求你了
You have to. Please.

324
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,710
求你了
Please.

325
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,890
我喜欢你的老花镜
I like those.

326
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,760
这样看上去年轻点
They make you look younger.

327
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,350
- 请快点  - 在路上了

328
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,540
查尔斯 听着 我得走了
Charles, listen.

329
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,240
我可能要离开几天 好吗
I gotta go away for a few days, okay?

330
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,210
我得跑趟长途挣笔大钱
I got a long ride for some good money...

331
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,290
回来后我们就离开这里
but when I get back, we're gonna get outta here.

332
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,380
我们开车去叶莱巴
We're gonna drive down to Yelapa.

333
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,770
然后再买艘船
We're gonna get ourselves a boat.

334
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,720
从此就住在海上
And we're gonna go live on the ocean.

335
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,890
到那儿就会安全了
Will you be safe there?

336
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,360
是的 当然 我们会安全的
Yeah. We'll be safe.

337
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,120
看罗根给我们带了什么 查尔斯
Look what Logan got us, Charles.

338
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,730
过几天就回来
Be back in a few days.

339
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,070
见鬼
Shit.

340
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,170
他们来了 请你...

341
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,840
- 罗根  - 什么？
- Logan.  - Yeah?

342
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,140
发生什么事了
What happened?

343
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,710
出什么事了吗
Did something go wrong?

344
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,350
这活儿一开始就是个错误
The job was wrong to begin with.

345
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,910
罗根
Logan!

346
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,300
罗根
Logan!

347
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,540
干嘛
What?

348
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,710
这些东西是谁的
Who does this belong to?

349
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,620
那是谁
Who's that?

350
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,860
你为什么没能预见这破事
Thought you were supposed to see shit coming.

351
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,190
我可以追踪变种人
I can track mutants.

352
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,390
我能嗅出很多东西 可我不是千里眼
I'm a glorified truffle pig, not a clairvoyant.

353
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,230
到里面去 别让查尔斯出声
Go inside and keep Charles quiet.

354
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,670
到里面去 快
Go inside now!

355
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,840
调头出去 混蛋
You need to turn around, asshole.

356
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,950
这是私人领地
This is private property.

357
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,280
是的 没错
Yes, it is.

358
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,750
事实上我记得这里应该属于
In fact, I believe it belongs

359
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,380
一家总部在上海的
to a multinational smelting company...

360
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,950
跨国冶炼公司
based in Shanghai.

361
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,790
你把老家伙藏哪儿了
Where are you keeping the old man? Hmm?

362
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,390
他在里面吗
Is he over there?

363
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,260
还是在这里
Or is he there?

364
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,430
点子不错
That'd be smart.

365
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,200
我想见见他
I'd like to meet him.

366
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,030
我听说国土安全局已经把他的大脑
I'm told the HSA classifies his brain

367
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,130
列为大规模杀伤性武器了
as a weapon of mass destruction now.

368
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,110
在东部发生的事真是可惜了
Damn shame, what happened back east.

369
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,570
他已经死了一年了
He's been dead for a year.

370
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,880
我需要那女孩儿
I need the girl.

371
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,090
什么女孩儿
What girl?

372
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,410
你手里那只球的主人
The one that goes along with that ball you're holding.

373
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,450
这里没有女孩儿
There's no girl here.

374
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,250
我知道你去过那家汽车旅馆
I know you went to the motel.

375
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,650
是的 有人订了车
Yeah, I was called there.

376
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,730
没有女孩儿 只有一个女人
There was no girl. It was just the woman.

377
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,400
只有一个女人 说得没错
Just the woman. Such as she was.

378
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,730
那么 你见过加芙列拉了
So, you saw Gabriela.

379
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,340
可你没有打给我 真是伤心
But you didn't call me. That hurts.

380
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,580
该不会是你朝她开的枪吧
You didn't shoot the poor thing, did you?

381
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,940
- 不 你呢  - 是我先问你的
- No, did you?  - I asked you first.

382
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,480
- 我不喜欢用枪  - 当然了
- I don't like guns.  - Of course.

383
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,010
真希望你有打给我 罗根
I wish you'd called me, Logan.

384
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,350
按照我说的那样
Like I asked.

385
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,650
看见没
See?

386
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,850
不是只有你一个人被改造过
You're not the only one that's been enhanced.

387
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,760
罗根 罗根
Logan. Logan!

388
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,940
这位是劳拉
This is Laura.

389
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,710
卡利班 快来
Caliban, come!

390
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,610
这位就是我一直和你提起的
This is who I've been telling you about.

391
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,470
这位是劳拉
This is Laura.

392
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,040
我们一直都在等你
We've been waiting for you.

393
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,870
我们一直都在等你（西班牙语）

394
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,150
过来 快过来
Come, come here.

395
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,690
没事了
It's okay.

396
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,190
过来
Come.

397
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,890
劳拉
Laura.

398
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,530
没事了 没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

399
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,770
过来
Come.

400
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,270
过来
Come.

401
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,130
来吧 没事的 你可以留在这儿 劳拉
Come. It's okay. You can stay here, Laura.

402
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
这儿很安全
It's safe.

403
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,410
在这儿我们可以照顾你
We can look after you here.

404
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,050
来吧
Come on.

405
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,080
看着像退役军人 也可能是个赏金猎人
Looks like ex-military. Bounty hunter, maybe?

406
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
更糟
Worse.

407
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,680
就他一个人？
Is he by himself?

408
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:55,910
对 但只是暂时的
Yeah, not for long.

409
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,190
把他搬上车
You get him back in his ride,

410
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,850
扔到干河床那儿去
take him out to the wash and dump him.

411
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,720
如果他半路醒了怎么办
What if he wakes up before I get there?

412
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,990
发消息告诉我你在哪儿 我们去接你
Text me where you are. We'll pick you up.

413
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,750
对 没错
Yes.

414
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,220
罗根
Logan.

415
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,250
- 罗根  - 嘿 嘿
- Logan.  - Hey. Hey!

416
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,880
等我搞明白你和你妈妈的
You'll get it back after I figure out

417
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,630
来龙去脉 我会还给你的
what you and your mother have got us into.

418
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,960
- 不 罗根  - 干嘛
- No, Logan.  - What?

419
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,130
我觉得 你可能
I think the...

420
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,310
罗根 你遇到的那个女人并不是她的妈妈
Logan, the woman that you met, that's not her mother.

421
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,480
- 所以她会说话  - 我们一直都有交流
- So she talks?  - We're communicating.

422
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,870
交流 好吧
Communicating.

423
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,710
快把这些药吃了
Take these now.

424
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,350
我们得马上离开 这里已经不安全了
We have to get out of here. It's not safe here anymore.

425
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,680
你不能在外面发作 明白吗
And you can't have an attack out there, you understand?

426
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,090
好的 可她就是我告诉你的那个新变种人
Yes, but this is the mutant that I told you about.

427
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,990
- 她需要帮助  - 她不是变种人
- She needs our help.  - She's not a mutant.

428
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,490
- 不 她是变种人  - 那她的天赋是什么 查尔斯
- Yes, she is!  - What's her gift, Charles?

429
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,130
吃东西 还是扔钢管
Eating? Pipe throwing?

430
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,260
没事的
It's okay.

431
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,770
只是火车经过

432
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,500
小火车 只是火车经过而已

433
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,770
别担心 火车而已

434
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,780
好了
Oh, yeah.

435
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,860
拿着枪 把尸体扔了
Take the gun. Dump the body.

436
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,090
回来的时候发消息给我
Text me when you're on the way back.

437
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,580
还有什么需要的吗
You have anything else you need?

438
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,260
孩子吃的食物
Food for the kid?

439
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,170
这下你完蛋了 变种人
You're fucked now, mutie.

440
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,680
别担心
It's okay.

441
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,970
只是另一辆火车经过而已

442
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,650
这次不是火车了
It's not a choo-choo.

443
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,330
没事的 坐下吧
It's okay. Sit down.

444
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,790
- 我们得走了  - 什么
- We gotta go.  - What?

445
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,520
- 出什么事了  - 待在这儿 去哪儿
- What's going on? Where?  - Stay here.

446
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,170
- 别乱动  - 我们要去哪儿
- Don't move.  - Where are we going?

447
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,700
别担心 他会回来找你的
Hey, don't worry. He will be back for you.

448
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,570
罗根 那女孩儿 你得回去接那女孩儿
Logan, the girl. You've got to go back for the girl.

449
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,020
罗根 那女孩儿怎么办
Logan, what about the girl?

450
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,020
罗根
Logan.

451
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,560
罗根 我们不能丢下劳拉
Logan, we mustn't forget about Laura.

452
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,060
她不归我们管
She's not our problem.

453
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,910
见鬼
Shit!

454
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,150
见鬼
Ah, shit!

455
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,000
（西班牙语）

456
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,110
罗根
Logan.

457
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,210
嗯 我在想办法
Yeah, I'm thinking.

458
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
那个孩子
The child.

459
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,880
罗根 我们不能丢下劳拉
Logan, we mustn't forget Laura.

460
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,250
- 求你别说了  - 罗根
- Please be quiet.  - Logan.

461
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,420
- 查尔斯·泽维尔  - 卡利班在哪儿
- Charles Xavier.  - Where's Caliban?

462
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,890
美国头号八旬通缉犯
America's most wanted octogenarian.

463
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,560
准确说我已经九十多岁了
I'm a nonagenarian, actually.

464
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,540
卡利班在哪儿
Where's Caliban?

465
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,190
不如你先告诉我那女孩儿在哪儿
Why don't you tell me where the girl is first?

466
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,130
或者我可以问老光头 他看起来比较友善
Or I could ask Cue Ball. He seems quite friendly.

467
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,750
我说了 她不在我这里
I told you, she's not here.

468
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,180
卡利班在哪儿 你这个混蛋
Where's Caliban, motherfucker?

469
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,660
我把他扔到了原本你为我
Well, I left him in the same ditch

470
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,740
预留的沟里
he was gonna leave me in.

471
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,330
天啊 金刚狼
Jesus, Wolverine,

472
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,440
看到你这副样子我真是太心碎了
seeing you like this just breaks my damn heart.

473
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,600
真不想亲手把你的心挖出来碾碎
As soon as I rip it out of your chest, fuck-stick.

474
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,780
把她带来
Go get her.

475
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,980
劳拉
Laura.

476
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,930
就是她
That a girl!

477
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,370
嘿 宝贝
Hey, baby.

478
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,970
劳拉
Laura...

479
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,980
劳拉
Laura!

480
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,150
宝贝 待在原地别动
Honey, you wanna stay where you are.

481
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,180
你想见你的朋友是吗
You wanna see your friends, right?

482
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,700
打死那个变种人

483
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,120
指挥官 别这样
Command, stop.

484
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,620
你不是说无论生死吗
You said alive or dead.

485
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
劳拉
Laura!

486
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,630
劳拉
Laura.

487
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,330
劳拉
Laura.

488
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,200
不 不
No. No.

489
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,500
动手 快
Move! Go!

490
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,610
开枪 快
Move! Go!

491
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,380
停止射击
Stop shooting!

492
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,680
她能自愈 快追 好了 去追
She heals! Move! Go!

493
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,820
天啊
Holy shit!

494
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,430
抓住你了
Gotcha!

495
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,910
快点 抓住她
Come on, hold her down.

496
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,590
我早就告诉你了 罗根 她和你一样是变种人
As I told you, Logan, she's a mutant like you.

497
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,110
坐稳了
Hold on!

498
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,470
和你非常像
Very much like you.

499
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,790
劳拉 你没事吧
Laura, are you all right?

500
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,820
快追
Move!

501
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,730
坐稳了
Hold on!

502
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,330
该死 快啊
Fuck! Come on!

503
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,010
快啊
Come on!

504
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,070
见鬼
Shit.

505
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,430
列阵 给我追
Fall in! Let's go!

506
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,570
小心
Oh, watch out!

507
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,750
坐回去
Sit back.

508
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,490
把追踪者带来
Bring me the tracker.

509
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,010
你
You.

510
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,280
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

511
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,610
嘿 我在问你话呢 你是谁
Hey! I asked you a question. Who are you?

512
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,380
你知道他是谁 罗根
You know who she is, Logan.

513
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,310
不 我不知道
No, I don't.

514
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,680
你不觉得她很像谁吗
Does she remind you of anybody?

515
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,520
我小的时候读到过你的故事
I read about you when I was a kid.

516
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,050
我想你认错人了
I believe you're thinking of someone else.

517
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,600
如果我没记错 你曾经也为我们效过力吧
Now, if I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team.

518
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,870
你帮我们围捕过那些变种人
You were helping round up all those old mutes.

519
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,070
现在怎么变了
What changed?

520
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:42,450
你信教了？
You got religion?

521
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,210
我需要你帮我们
I'm gonna need you to do

522
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,050
这样的好人再做一件事
one more thing for the good guys...

523
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,360
再帮我追踪一个特别的变种人
and track one more special mute for me.

524
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,730
我不会帮你的
I'm not helping you.

525
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,900
你知道你会这么说
Of course, you'd say that.

526
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,440
不过我总觉得人的本质是不会变的
But I got a theory that people don't really change.

527
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,300
小心光
Beware of the light.

528
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,140
卡利班 我猜小时候 你妈妈肯定每天
Caliban, I bet that's what your mama told you

529
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,870
都这么和你说吧
every day when you was a kid.

530
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,420
小心光
Beware of the light.

531
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,060
好了 别让我们互相撕破脸皮
Now, let's not bring out the worst in each other.

532
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,660
为了那女孩儿不值得
The girl is not worth it, trust me.

533
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,160
你们不一样 她生下来不是变种人
She's not a natural fuck-up like you.

534
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:40,000
他是公司犯下的错误 研发失误
She's a business mistake, a R&D gone bad.

535
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,400
就是个累赘
There's liability.

536
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,170
不能就这么让专利产品
They can't have things with patents

537
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,000
到处乱跑 伤害无辜不是吗
running around, hurting people, can they?

538
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,970
在她伤害别人之前
We need to get her off the board

539
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,670
我们得把她带回去
before she hurts anybody else.

540
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,480
或许下一个就是你在乎的人
Someone you care about, maybe.

541
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,420
好好闻一闻吧
So, get to sniffin'.

542
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,920
我叫做加芙列拉·洛佩兹
My name is Gabriela López.

543
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:09,530
我是名护士
I am a nurse.

544
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,360
过去十年我一直在为
And for 10 years, I worked for

545
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,940
墨西哥城的基因改造研究所工作
Transigen Research in Mexico City.

546
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,800
该研究所属于一家美国公司
Transigen is owned by an American company.

547
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:23,650
接下来你们看到的 在美国和加拿大
What I am about to show you is illegal...

548
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,210
都是非法的
in the U.S. And Canada.

549
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,700
阿尔卡利实验室 实验备忘录
桑德尔·莱斯博士 癌症项目主管

550
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:36,020
他说我们是研究药物的
They told us we were part of a pharmaceutical study.

551
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,190
当然 这都是骗人的
But, of course, that was a lie.

552
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,630
这些孩子都出生在研究所里
These children were born in Transigen.

553
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,170
他们出生在这里
They were born here...

554
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,700
然后就再也没离开过
and have never left.

555
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,400
他们从来没见过阳光和大海
They have never seen the sun or the ocean...

556
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,740
雨水或飘雪
rain or snow...

557
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,840
或者上帝的其他造物
or any of God's creatures.

558
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,680
他们没有出生证明
They have no birth certificates...

559
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,580
没有名字
no names...

560
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,080
除了我们给他们的代号
besides the ones we have given them.

561
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,090
他们都是在墨西哥女孩的肚子里孕育出来的
They were raised in the bellies of Mexican girls.

562
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,190
孩子出生后女孩儿就再也找不到了
Girls no one can find anymore.

563
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:15,160
他们的父亲都是些
Their fathers are semillas genéticas...

564
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:16,830
基因种子
special seeds in bottles.

565
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,940
- 有过生日吗  - 玛利亚
- Birthday? No birth. - María.

566
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:35,580
万圣节别给孩子打扮
We do not dress them up for Halloween.

567
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,880
别叫他们宝贝 也别叫他们亲亲
We do not call them "baby" or kiss boo-boos.

568
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,900
别把他们看作孩子
Don't think of them as children.

569
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:41,970
当他们是产品
Think of them as things...

570
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,460
有专利有版权的产品

571
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:44,630
明白吗
Comprende?

572
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:45,730
明白
Si, señor.

573
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,130
他们以为我们又穷
They thought we were too poor

574
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,430
又傻根本不理解
and stupid to understand.

575
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,040
我们是很穷
We're poor, yes...

576
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,240
可我们并不傻
but we are not stupid.

577
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,460
运用你的能力
Use your powers.

578
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,110
这是桩生意
This is business.

579
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,750
他们在制造士兵
They are making soldiers.

580
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,380
杀人机器
Killers.

581
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,420
这些年幼的变种人
These are babies of mutantes...

582
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,330
北达科他州
North Dakota.

583
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,670
你拿了那女人的钱
You took that woman's money.

584
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:30,270
你答应会带那孩子去那儿的
You said you would take the child there.

585
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:37,010
他是什么人
What is she?

586
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,110
她是你女儿 罗根
She's your daughter, Logan.

587
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,980
阿尔卡利有你的遗传密码

588
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:45,320
不只是我的
Not just mine.

589
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,460
罗根
Logan...

590
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,600
我不想谈这事儿
I don't want to talk about it.

591
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,840
也不想听你再说下去
I don't wanna hear about it anymore.

592
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,190
- 罗根  - 别再说了
- Logan...  - Just stop.

593
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,200
我想尿尿

594
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,310
最后一次
Last ride.

595
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,840
不客气
You're welcome.

596
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,700
住手 看在上帝的份上
Stop it. For God's sake,

597
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,060
我自己能行
I can do this myself!

598
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,400
对 可你并没有成功
Yeah, well, you're not doing it.

599
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:23,550
赶紧尿吧
Just get on with it.

600
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,190
你站在那我怎么尿
Not with you standing there.

601
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,890
放心 我不会偷看的
Trust me, I'm not lookin'.

602
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:01,930
小姑娘
Hello.

603
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,590
你好
Hi, there!

604
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,660
知道吃东西要给钱吧
You know you gotta pay for that, right?

605
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:10,370
你爸爸妈妈在哪里
Hey! Where's your mommy and daddy, huh?

606
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:14,650
过来
Come on.

607
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:15,910
闹够了 这个给我
That's enough. These, too.

608
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,520
- 我靠  - 不能这样
- Shit!  - Not okay!

609
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,880
抱歉
Sorry.

610
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,820
手机充电器有吗
Um, do you sell phone chargers?

611
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,260
快走 到车上去
Come on. Get in the car.

612
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,530
随着孩子慢慢长大
As the children became older...

613
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,720
劳拉 劳拉
Laura. Laura.

614
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,060
他们变得越来越难相处
They became more difficult.

615
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,200
我们控制不了他们
They could not be controlled.

616
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:19,040
公司把他们变成了武器
The company made their bodies into weapons.

617
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,750
开始教他们如何杀人
Tried to teach them to kill.

618
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,140
可他们不想战斗
But they did not want to fight.

619
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:29,720
不想打仗的士兵对他们来说毫无意义
A soldier who will not fight is useless.

620
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,760
在这栋大楼里
Inside this building...

621
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,280
他们还在研究新的东西
they are working on something new.

622
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:39,060
一个比这些孩子更强的东西
Something they think is better than the children.

623
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,670
身份代码：X-24

624
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:42,210
他们说那是个没有灵魂的东西
Something they say is without a soul.

625
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:43,680
莱斯博士 你看过完整的报告了吗
Would you like to hear my full lab report, Dr. Rice?

626
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,330
这里吃不到寿司
You can't get good sushi here.

627
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,600
这里就像科罗拉多州的丹佛
It's the Mexican equivalent of Denver, Colorado.

628
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,580
他们肯定已经成功了
They must have been successful.

629
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,780
大约一周以前 他们告诉我们要停止项目
About a week ago, they told us to shut our program down.

630
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,120
他们开始对那些孩子实施安乐死
They started putting the children to sleep.

631
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,620
我们要救出尽可能多的孩子
We are going to save as many children as we can.

632
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,020
我知道一个地方 在北方
I read about a place, up north.

633
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,090
一个属于变种人的地方
A place for mutants.

634
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,460
他们称之为伊甸园
They call it Eden.

635
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,100
如果你看到了这段视频
If you are watching this...

636
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:31,110
那证明我已经死了
it means that I am dead.

637
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,450
我不知道还有没有其他幸存下来的孩子
I am not sure if any other children survived.

638
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,950
我们走散了
We were separated.

639
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,150
没有另一笔钱
There is no more money.

640
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,990
是我骗了你
That was a lie.

641
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,050
她不是我的孩子
She's not my child.

642
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,960
可我爱她
But I love her.

643
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,530
你可能不会像我一样爱她
You may not love her.

644
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:55,540
可她是你的孩子
But she is your child.

645
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:59,230
求你了 我请求你
Please. I beg you...

646
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:01,670
把她送到安全的地方
take her to safety.

647
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,960
我们要躲在这里吗
Is this where we're hiding out?

648
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,780
我们不躲
We're not hiding out.

649
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,920
找个地方睡几个小时
We're gonna get a couple of hours' sleep...

650
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,690
清洗一下 找几件新衣服
clean up, get some new clothes,

651
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,890
换俩新车离开这里
get a new ride and get outta here.

652
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,990

694

你知道里面都是瞎写的吧
You do know they're all bullshit, right?

00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,770
是对是错 你都得背负
Right or wrong, it's a brand.

714
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,440
直至一生
A brand sticks.

715
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:36,950
现在快回去找你妈妈
Now you run on home to your mother,

716
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:38,740
告诉她一切都好
and tell her everything's all right.

717
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:43,010
山谷里再不会有枪声了
And there aren't any more guns in the valley.

718
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:04,910
你们是谁
Who are you guys?

719
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,670
又是警察？ 可我已经
More cops? 'Cause I told

720
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,280
把我知道的都告诉了
the other guys everything that I...

721
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,220
暂停营业

722
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,520
起来 到笼子里去 追踪者
Get up! In your cage, tracker.

723
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,350
已经没你的事了
You did your job.

724
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,410
伙计们
Fellas.

725
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,220
见鬼
Shit.

726
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,100
送你们了
Knock yourselves out.

727
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,610
最低8000
I'll tell you what. Eight grand...

728
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,870
我可以帮你喷新漆 换一下轮胎
I'll have her freshly painted for you, new tires...

729
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:10,710
安装调试好 再帮你把手续办了
mounted, balanced, and complete paperwork.

730
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:12,000
我给你10000
I'll give you 10 as-is,

731
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:13,540
手续的事就跳过吧
if you can forget the paperwork.

732
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:17,570
你还是需要换轮胎 不换不行
Well, you still need new tires, man, they're bald.

733
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,870
多久能办好
How long will that take?

734
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,080
一个小时
An hour.

735
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:44,400
伊甸园 还是终结？

736
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,680
搞什么鬼
Jesus.

737
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,020
北达科他州

738
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,200
这是在逗我吗
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

739
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,500
先生 你的钥匙
Sir, are the keys in... Sir!

740
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,680
你的钥匙在车里吗 先生
You have the keys in it? Sir!

741
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,780
该死
Shit!

742
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,970
查尔斯 查尔斯
Charles. Charles!

743
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:28,990
上行
Going up.

744
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,010
见鬼
Oh, shit!

745
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,380
你没事吧
You all right?

746
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,610
我们得赶紧离开
We gotta get outta here.

747
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,530
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

748
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:00,560
真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

749
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,000
紧急救护人员仍在
Emergency personnel are still on scene

750
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,590
俄克拉荷马市的哈利士赌场旅馆
at Harrah's Casino Hotel in Oklahoma City...

751
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,700
昨日至少400人出现
where at least 400 guests were stricken

752
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,590
暂时性麻痹症状
with temporary paralysis yesterday.

753
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:36,560
受伤情况大都和
Many are noting a similarity

754
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,500
一年前的韦斯切斯特事故十分相似
to the Westchester incident over a year ago...

755
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:40,200
当时有超过600人受伤
that left over 600 injured...

756
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,680
7名变种人身亡
and took the lives of seven mutants,

757
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:43,110
其中包括几名X战警
including several of the X-Men.

758
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:45,000
别玩了
Knock it off.

759
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:49,380
让你别玩了
I said, knock it off!

760
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,100
她只是个孩子 罗根
She's a child, Logan.

761
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,120
事实上 她是你的
And, point of fact, she's your...

762
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,120
上次吃药是什么时候
How long has it been since you took your meds?

763
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,370
告诉我 隔了多久
Tell me, how long has it been?

764
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,690
我不知道
I don't know!

765
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:03,690
两天吧
Two days.

766
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,390
昨天发生的事你也看到了
You saw what happened yesterday.

767
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,610
要不是我及时赶到
If that shit had gone on any longer,

768
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:07,690
赌场里那些人不就...
everyone in that casino...

769
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,030
我只是尽我所能保护劳拉
I did what I had to do to save Laura.

770
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:11,460
你什么都做不了
You didn't do anything.

771
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:14,070
你只是受了惊吓发病了而已
You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure!

772
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:18,110
我想你更喜欢我吃了药像疯子一样
I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated,

773
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,070
语无伦次的模样吧
rambling on like a lunatic.

774
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,750
这样你就能轻松些
So much easier for you.

775
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:22,970
轻松个屁
Easier? Jesus!

776
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:25,380
和你在一起就不会轻松 从来不会
There is nothing easy about you, Charles, nothing!

777
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,980
就像这世上其他人一样
Yes, yes, please be like the rest of the world...

778
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,650
把自己的过错都怪罪到别人头上
blaming someone else for your boring shit.

779
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,620
我懂 老爹 你对我太失望了
I know, Pop, I'm such a giant disappointment.

780
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:36,660
你真的打心底不明白
You honestly derive no sense of purpose...

781
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:37,890
我们为什么要这么做吗
from what we're doing?

782
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,590
好吧 那我们到底在做什么
Okay, what are we doing? Hmm?

783
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:43,890
有一个新生的变种人坐在我们的车上
There is a young mutant sitting in our car.

784
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,100
对 没错
Yeah, I see that.

785
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,460
而我们要去的地方还有其他的孩子
And where we're taking her, there are others.

786
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:49,440
难道你还看不出这意味着什么吗
Does that mean nothing to you?

787
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,440
是的 我看不出个所以然
Yeah, means nothing to me.

788
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,170
尤其是当我知道那个护士
Especially since Nurse Gabriela...

789
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,780
说的伊甸园是根据漫画胡编乱造出来的之后
made all that Eden shit up with fucking comic books.

790
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,610
你在说些什么
What are you talking about?

791
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:58,940
你把这个给他
Give those to him, will you?

792
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,190
该吃药了 拿两片给他
Take out two pills and give them to him.

793
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:01,680
- 罗根 罗根  - 把药给她
- Logan! Logan!  - Give 'em to him.

794
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,010
快点
Now!

795
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:08,990
张嘴我看看
I wanna see it.

796
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,980
莱斯博士 我们马上就能...
Dr. Rice. It's under control...

797
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:04,580
该死的无人卡车
Motherfucking auto-trucks.

798
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,040
别爆粗口 罗根
Language, Logan.

799
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,340
你冲着一台机器发火干嘛
And you're screaming at a machine.

800
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,250
干嘛 她可以杀人不眨眼
Oh, what? She can gut a man with her feet,

801
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:11,900
却听不得脏话吗
she can't hear a few naughty words, huh?

802
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,480
我们可以教她成为更好的人
She can learn to be better.

803
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:16,090
你是说和我比吗
You mean, better than me?

804
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:17,990
一点儿没错
Actually, yes.

805
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,890
还有 劳拉脚上的爪子
And, by the way, Laura's foot claws...

806
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,660
很显然是由于性别所致
are the obvious result of her gender, you know.

807
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,030
是吗
Is that a fact?

808
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,100
在狮群当中 母狮子
In a pride of lions, the female...

809
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,740
既要负责捕猎 又要负责照顾狮群
is both hunter and caregiver.

810
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,000
真长知识
Good to know.

811
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:34,880
她们用前爪捕猎
She uses her front claws for hunting...

812
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,380
用后爪防御
and the back claws defensively.

813
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,480
是吗
Oh, yeah?

814
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,170
这样才能幸存下来
Thus, ensuring their survival.

815
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:46,580
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey!

816
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:17,080
我们得帮他们一把
We should help them.

817
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,790
不 我们得赶路 有人会来帮忙的
No, we have to keep going. Someone will come along.

818
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:22,620
不就是我们吗
Someone has come along.

819
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:36,670
警报 警报
Alert. Alert.

820
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:21,360
嘿 要帮忙吗
Hey, uh, you need a hand?

821
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:24,370

822
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:28,810

823
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:31,420
好了 我们回家吧
Come on, let's get home.

824
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,520
劳拉
Laura!

825
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:34,020
谢谢你们的帮忙
Thank you so much for your help.

826
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:35,550
- 我叫凯瑟琳  - 詹姆斯
- I'm Kathryn.  - James.

827
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:36,750
我儿子内特
This is my son, Nate.

828
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,150
- 嗨  - 嘿
- Hi.  - Hey.

829
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,690
那是你女儿？
That's your daughter?

830
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:42,020
对 她叫劳拉 那是我父亲
Yeah, that's Laura, and that's my dad...

831
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:43,990
查克
Chuck.

832
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:44,990
好了 劳拉 该走了
Come on, Laura, let's go.

833
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,030
我想请你们到我们家
Well, can we show our appreciation

834
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:48,840
吃顿晚饭以示感谢
and treat the three of you to a decent meal?

835
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:50,060
我们家离这儿不远
We don't live far from here.

836
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,290
- 不用了  - 那真是太好了
- Uh, no, thanks.  - That would be lovely!

837
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:01,780
我是莱斯博士
My name is Dr. Rice.

838
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,710
如果你喜欢也可以叫我桑德尔
But you can call me Zander if you like.

839
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,320
我同事告诉我
My colleague tells me

840
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:08,780
你不太愿意配合我们
you've been somewhat resistant.

841
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:10,920
他说你给他的消息
He believes you've been

842
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,750
总是不及时
dispensing delayed information...

843
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,980
所以你的朋友总是快我们一步
to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.

844
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,740
我现在是在给你
I'm offering you the possibility

845
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,960
赎罪的机会 卡利班
of redemption, Caliban.

846
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:23,930
去保护这个世界 同时
To protect the world, and in the process,

847
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,260
拯救你的朋友
save your friends.

848
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:28,740
而那个小女孩儿只是一个小小的代价而已
The girl is a rather small price to pay for that.

849
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,640
她不是你的同类
Unlike you, she's impure.

850
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,570
她不是天生的变种人
She wasn't made by nature.

851
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:33,900
她只是我犯下的一个错误
She's a mistake of my own.

852
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:35,150
我尽了全力
I did what I could

853
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,450
可他们用光照我 打我
and they burned me and beat me.

854
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:38,310
你的同事都是群野蛮人
Your colleagues are savages.

855
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:40,180
我同意
I agree.

856
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:42,250
那些掠夺者都是群废物
The Reavers were very ineffective.

857
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,290
不过我带了新的帮手来
But I'm bringing new tools to bear.

858
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:46,490
可我还是需要有人
But I still need someone

859
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,770
为我们指明方向
to point us in the right direction.

860
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:48,950
不 我帮不了你
No, I can't help you.

861
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,790
别激动 别激动
Breathe, breathe.

862
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,960
那个老头现在情况有多糟糕？
Now, what does he have? The old man.

863
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,860
老年痴呆 渐冻症？
Alzheimer's? ALS?

864
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:57,660
世界上最危险的大脑
A degenerative brain disease

865
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,130
居然得了脑退化
in the world's most dangerous brain?

866
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,100
真是讽刺
What a combo.

867
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:07,000
开饭了 我们有客人 规矩点
Be nice. Now, you know we got company.

868
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:08,270
真是太好了
That's wonderful.

869
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,720
快请坐
Everybody, have a seat.

870
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,010
内特快坐好
Nate, sit up.

871
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,930
詹姆斯 你坐在桌子那边吧
James, why don't you sit at the end of the table?

872
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,940
你来做祷告好吗 来吧宝贝
You wanna say grace? Say grace, baby.

873
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:18,480
感谢上帝 赐予我们食物
Uh, thank you, God, for this food...

874
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:21,680
还有感谢我们的新朋友
and for our new friends, the Howletts.

875
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:23,160
感谢他们的帮忙
Mmm. They came to our aid.

876
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,690
- 阿门  - 阿门
- Amen.  - Amen.

877
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,470
阿门 给你查尔斯
Here we go. Here you go, Charles.

878
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,260
多谢
Thank you, sir.

879
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:48,180
如果她想吃还有很多
Oh, there's plenty more if she wants.

880
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:49,940
不用了 谢谢
She's fine. Thank you.

881
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,240
菜的味道很好
This is delicious.

882
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,700
- 谢谢  - 真的很好吃
- Oh, thank you.  - It's so good.

883
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,060
你们要去哪里？
Where are you all headed?

884
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:55,660
- 俄勒冈州  - 南达科他州
- Uh... Oregon.  - South Dakota.

885
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,960
先去俄勒冈 然后再去南达科他
Well, Oregon and then South Dakota.

886
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:02,460
去度假吗
Vacation?

887
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:03,670
没错
Uh... Yes.

888
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,800
计划了很久了
Uh, long overdue.

889
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,200
我们住在城市里
We're city folk.

890
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:10,840
一直都想沿着公路自驾游 看看整个国家
Always wanted to take a road trip, see the country.

891
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:13,480
还有看看不同的风土人情
Um... And meet the people in it.

892
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:14,870
听起来很棒
That sounds lovely.

893
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,200
我一直都想说服威尔
Been trying to get Will here

894
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,750
去度假 都好几年了
to take a vacation for years now.

895
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,590
如果我们到处旅游
Oh. If we go traipsing all over the country,

896
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,760
谁来打理这个地方
who's gonna take care of this place?

897
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:22,650
没错 所以才让你卖了农场
Exactly. I say, let it go.

898
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:23,850
那靠什么养家
And live off what?

899
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,720
上帝会眷顾我们的
The Lord will provide.

900
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,770
我还在等上帝赐予我一台
I'm still waiting for the Lord to provide me

901
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:29,070
新的打谷机呢
with a new thresher.

902
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:31,190
反正总有一天我会去旅行的
All the same, I'd love to travel someday.

903
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,490
我相信会有那么一天的
And I bet you will.

904
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,240
- 我可以退学  - 行了 别说得像真的一样
- I could drop out of school.  - Okay, let's not go that far.

905
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:37,360
我说真的
I mean, I'll do it.

906
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:38,770
- 不行  - 为什么不行
- No. No.  - Why not?

907
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,180
你不是想去旅行吗 我也想
You wanna travel, I wanna travel.

908
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:41,270
行了儿子
Son. Son.

909
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:42,880
正合你意对吧
That sounds good to you, right?

910
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:44,100
简直就是完美
This is the perfect plan.

911
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:45,710
为什么想要退学呢 内特
Why would you want to do that, Nate?

912
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,880
注意了 他可是个创办过学校的人
Careful, you're speaking to a man who ran a school...

913
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:51,850
还开了好多年对吧 查尔斯
for a lot of years. Right, Charles?

914
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,380
好吧 是的 那是一所
Yes, it was a...

915
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:58,110
一所为特殊孩子开设的学校
It was a special needs school. Um...

916
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,880
这个解释不错
Uh-huh. That's a good description.

917
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:03,060
他也在那儿
He was there, too.

918
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:04,260
对 没错
Oh, yeah, no. Um...

919
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:06,560
我还被开除过几次
I got kicked out a few times.

920
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,290
我也希望能夸你是个好学生
I wish I could say you were a good pupil,

921
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:09,630
可我就是说不出口
but the words would choke me.

922
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,290
真的非常感谢你们的款待
Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for this.

923
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:35,760
今晚真的很棒
Uh, it was great.

924
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,660
不过我们还得赶路
But we have a long drive ahead of us, so...

925
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,140
可你们总得休息吧
But you need to rest, don't you?

926
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,800
我们会找到旅馆的
Yeah, we'll find a motel somewhere.

927
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:41,940
最近的开过去也要两个小时
The nearest one is two hours from here

928
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:43,090
条件还不怎么样
and it's not even that nice.

929
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:45,270
我们楼上有个空房间
We have a perfectly fine room upstairs

930
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:46,510
可以给你父亲和女儿住
for your father and your daughter and

931
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,280
而你可以睡在客厅的折叠沙发上
you can sleep in the living room on the convertible.

932
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:49,520
凯瑟琳 真的很感谢
Kathryn, it's very, very nice of you,

933
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:50,770
不过我们还是不打扰了
but we really should go.

934
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,000
我们可以明天一早再走
We can leave early in the morning.

935
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:56,480
天一亮就走 你觉得呢
Break of dawn, as it were.

936
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:01,150
好吧 那我给你洗漱一下吧 老爸
Okay, why don't we wash up, Pop?

937
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,350
好的
Okay.

938
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:03,450
坐下
Sit.

939
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:09,350
宝贝 要来点甜品吗
Um, sweetie, you want some dessert?

940
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:10,860
两天的路程
Two days on the road,

941
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,830
就吃了一顿饭 还几乎没睡过觉
only one meal, and hardly any sleep.

942
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:15,020
她才11岁 而我90了
She's 11, I'm fucking 90.

943
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:17,060
可我们有101个理由继续赶路
Well, that's 101 reasons to keep moving.

944
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:19,240
我不是一盒牛油果 罗根
I'm not a box of avocados, Logan.

945
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,180
所以呢 过了今晚然后呢
And then what? We stay the night, then what?

946
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:24,660
然后我们带她去伊甸园找她的朋友
Then we take her to her friends in Eden.

947
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:29,280
然后 然后我们就去买逐日号
And then we buy the Sunseeker.

948
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,180
先吃药
Take the pills.

949
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:37,690
见鬼
Oh, shit!

950
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,790
- 怎么了  - 内特
- What's going on?  - Nate!

951
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:42,960
趁还有点水压快去把浴缸放满
Go fill up the tub before we lose pressure.

952
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,460
亲爱的 检查下水槽
Honey, check the sink.

953
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:46,030
他们又把水给断了
They shut it off again.

954
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:48,380
他们就是不肯罢休
They are just not going to let this thing go.

955
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,880
你最好现在就去处理一下
Well, you might as well handle it now.

956
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,880
等到明天早上吧 昨晚刚下过雨
It can wait till the morning. We just had rain last night.

957
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,200
可家里还有客人
We got three houseguests

958
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:54,380
还有一大堆碟子没洗
and a sink full of dishes.

959
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:56,100
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

960
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,440
供水站离这里
The pump station that supplies us

961
01:14:58,540 --> 01:14:59,780
大概一英里半
is a mile and a half from here.

962
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,610
有的时候它会停止运作
Sometimes it gets itself shut off.

963
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:02,850
- 是那群混蛋  - 嘿
- By assholes.  - Hey!

964
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:03,980
别乱动
No.

965
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:06,210
我儿子可以和你一起去
My son is happy to go with you.

966
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,180
不 不 不 没关系
No, no, no, that's fine.

967
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:10,190
那些人有的时候不太...
The men that do this, sometimes they can be...

968
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,050
- 我和你一起去  - 不 你得做作业
- I can go.  - No, you got homework.

969
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:13,720
我和你去
All right, I'll go.

970
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:15,620
让我先安顿好我爸爸
Just, uh, let me get my dad settled.

971
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,500
来吧
All right.

972
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:24,500
我是说我不在乎律师说了什么
I'm just saying, I don't care what the lawyer says.

973
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:27,990
可这样很危险
But it's dangerous.

974
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:30,140
我不会让他们伤害我们的
I'm not gonna hurt our chances.

975
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,380
有电视 要看吗
Want TV? There's TV here.

976
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:46,590
不用了
I'm fine.

977
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:47,820
好吧 好好休息
Okay. Get some rest.

978
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:49,890
知道吗 罗根
You know, Logan...

979
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,590
生活就应该像这样
this is what life looks like.

980
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:55,660
一个家 家人彼此相爱
A home, people who love each other.

981
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:56,990
安全的港湾
Safe place.

982
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,690
你应该花时间感受一下
You should take a moment and feel it.

983
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:04,510
对 这儿很好
Yeah. It's great.

984
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:06,200
罗根 罗根
Logan. Logan!

985
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:10,270
你还有时间
You still have time.

986
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,950
查尔斯 世界已经变了样了
Charles, the world is not the same as it was.

987
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:22,090
待在这里我们会有风险 你知道的
We're taking a risk hanging around here, you know that.

988
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:25,290
还有我们要去的那个伊甸园
And where we're going, Eden...

989
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:27,600
其实并不存在
it doesn't exist.

990
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,630
它是护士从漫画书上看来的
Her nurse got it from a comic book.

991
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:34,940
你懂了吗 都是假的
You understand? It's not real.

992
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,630
对劳拉来说是真的
It is for Laura.

993
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:43,910
对劳拉来说是真的
It is for Laura.

994
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,220
好好休息
Get some rest.

995
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,660
坎伍德饮料公司买下了这里的一切
Canewood Beverage bought up everything out here,

996
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:54,920
除了我们的农场
except for us.

997
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:57,720
我们不想卖 他们就想强行征用
When we wouldn't sell, they tried eminent domain...

998
01:16:57,930 --> 01:16:59,490
然后断我们的水源
then screwing with our water.

999
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:03,000
几个月前有人下毒杀死了我们的狗
Couple of months ago, somebody poisoned our dogs.

1000
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:06,300
所以今天在公路上也不是意外？
So, out on the highway today, those trucks...

1001
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:08,930
我不知道 或许吧
Who knows. Maybe.

1002
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:12,140
看看他们
Hey, look at 'em.

1003
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:14,580
就像一只四肢发达
Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton bodies

1004
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:15,940
头脑简单的恐龙
and tiny little brains...

1005
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:18,270
在给他们的超级转基因玉米剥壳
shucking their cloned-up super corn.

1006
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,800
那玩意儿味道简直像屎一样
You know it tastes like shit, too.

1007
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,110
那为什么还有人吃
Why do people eat it?

1008
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,650
不是吃的 是用来喝的 玉米糖浆
They don't. They drink it. Corn syrup.

1009
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:25,660
加了那东西 他们就能保持清醒
It's in those drinks that everyone's having...

1010
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,320
很有精神 还能带来性欲什么的
to stay awake, cheer up, feel strong, sexy, whatever.

1011
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:32,330
今时不同往日了 它能让你一杯解千愁
Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day.

1012
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:33,900
可惜对我没用
Mine still are.

1013
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:58,580
这些是套牛比赛赢来的
Those are for breakaway roping.

1014
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,420
那些事绕桶比赛得来的
Those are for barrel racing...

1015
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:03,660
还有这些 绕杆比赛得来的
and right here is for pole bending.

1016
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:05,660
不过全是二三等奖
They're all second, third place.

1017
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:09,460
我不是很在行 不过我爸爸硬要我参加
I'm not too good at it, but my dad makes me.

1018
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:20,140
你想听吗
Do you want to listen?

1019
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:31,510
喜欢吗
Do you like it?

1020
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:37,820
给 借你听一晚
Um, here, you can take it for tonight...

1021
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:41,060
明早你再还给我
and I'll get it back from you in the morning.

1022
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:55,970
看来得弄一会儿了
Looks like we're gonna be here a while.

1023
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:30,710
能撑一阵子
Should hold it.

1024
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:32,010
没错
Yeah.

1025
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,840
撑到下一次
Till next time.

1026
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:35,540
谢谢
Thanks.

1027
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,850
那么 你女儿那样
Hey, so, uh, how long has your girl

1028
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,550
- 有多久了  - 什么
- been like that?  - Huh?

1029
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:43,120
不说话
Mute.

1030
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,730
从一开始就这样
Uh, since the beginning.

1031
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,430
其实我还挺羡慕你的
Well, in a lot of ways, I envy you.

1032
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:53,700
等她到了内特的年纪
They get to be Nate's age,

1033
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:55,810
就不会说些蠢话了
with the nonsense that comes out of their mouths...

1034
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:59,040
让你怀疑做父母的意义何在
Makes you wonder the whole point of it all.

1035
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:02,940
见鬼
Shit.

1036
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:08,150
别担心
Don't worry.

1037
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,750
不会用上枪的
We won't need it.

1038
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:11,250
待在这儿
Stay here.

1039
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:19,920
晚上好 芒森先生
Evening, Mr. Munson.

1040
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,580
什么风把你吹来了
What brings y'all this way?

1041
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:24,070
你为什么不问问你的手下
Why don't you ask your boys?

1042
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:25,390
芒森先生
Mr. Munson,

1043
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,250
你知道你这样是非法入侵吧
you understand you're trespassing right now, right?

1044
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:28,820
我和这里以前的主人
I have an easement with the previous owner

1045
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,840
签订过地役权
of your property.

1046
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:31,240
胡扯
Huh. Bullshit.

1047
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,410
你也说是“前”主人了
"Previous" being the operative word.

1048
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:35,870
他是谁？
Who's this?

1049
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:38,250
劝你赶紧回
Just a guy telling you

1050
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,650
车上去的好心人
to get back in your nice truck.

1051
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:42,480
到别的地方去扮你的地痞流氓
Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.

1052
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:48,050
嘿 卡尔
Hey, Carl...

1053
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:51,920
看来芒森先生雇了一个打手
it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle.

1054
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:53,430
看起来是的
Looks that way.

1055
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:55,060
他只是我的朋友
He's a friend of mine.

1056
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:56,820
你朋友口气挺大
A friend with a big mouth.

1057
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,430
这话我听得多了
I hear that a lot.

1058
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,280
那你肯定也听过这个吧
Then you probably hear this, too.

1059
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,400
多了去了
More than I'd like.

1060
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:05,740
那你知道该怎么做了
Then you know the drill.

1061
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:08,740
我数三下
I'mma count to three...

1062
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:10,350
你们给我离开这儿
and you're gonna start walking away.

1063
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:11,460
这里的水我有权使用
I got rights to this water.

1064
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,610
- 一  - 我请了律师
- One.  - I have a lawyer now.

1065
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,720
二
Two.

1066
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:16,780
三
Three.

1067
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:18,290
头儿 你还好吗
You all right, boss?

1068
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:21,780
知道该怎么做了吧
You know the drill.

1069
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:22,790
把帽子给我捡起来
Pick up my goddamn hat.

1070
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:23,890
赶紧给我滚
Get the hell out of here.

1071
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:25,860
- 头儿？  - 去你的
- You okay, boss?  - Fuck off.

1072
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:27,060
滚
Go!

1073
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,480
你受过训练
You've had training.

1074
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:47,020
算是吧
Some.

1075
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:08,860
先别叫醒她
Hey, don't wake her yet.

1076
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:11,670
让她再睡一小时
Let her sleep another hour.

1077
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:17,740
知道吗 罗根
You know, Logan...

1078
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,420
毫无疑问 今天晚上
this was, without a doubt...

1079
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:28,550
是我这么久以来度过的最美好的夜晚
the most perfect night I've had in a very long time.

1080
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,590
可我并不配拥有它
But I don't deserve it.

1081
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:41,770
不是吗
Do I?

1082
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,540
我做过一些事
I did something.

1083
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:52,610
一些不可言说的事
Something unspeakable.

1084
01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:02,120
发生在维斯切斯特的事我全记起来了
I've remembered what happened in Westchester.

1085
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,100
这已经不是我第一次伤害别人了
This is not the first time I've hurt people.

1086
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:15,400
只是在今天之前 我一直都不知道
Until today, I didn't know.

1087
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:18,380
你也不告诉我
You wouldn't tell me.

1088
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:26,540
所以我们就这样一直逃避下去
So we just kept on running away from it.

1089
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,620
我想我终于能理解你了
I think I finally understand you.

1090
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:39,290
罗根
Logan...

1091
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,420
他简直完美
He's fantastic.

1092
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:09,950
你说过你只要那个女孩儿
You said you only needed the girl!

1093
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,150
我也说过我带了新帮手来
I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear.

1094
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:13,560
我给过你朋友机会
Your friends had every chance.

1095
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:14,930
你也是
And so did you.

1096
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:17,130
内特
Nate?

1097
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:22,270
放下她
Put her down.

1098
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:31,710
亲爱的
Honey.

1099
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,840
别上来 威尔
Stay down there, Will!

1100
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:37,220
住手
Stop!

1101
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:39,790
凯瑟琳
Kathryn!

1102
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:41,470
凯瑟琳
Kathryn!

1103
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:42,720
凯瑟琳
Kathryn!

1104
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,310
查尔斯
Charles!

1105
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:14,550
查尔斯
Charles!

1106
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:28,910
按住伤口
Hold this.

1107
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:31,200
那不是我 那不是我
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

1108
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,880
他来了
Here he comes.

1109
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:36,870
我可以过去
I could pick him up,

1110
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:37,980
接他
meet him halfway.

1111
01:25:38,150 --> 01:25:39,580
不 让他们过来
No, no, no. Let them come to us.

1112
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:41,880
X-23很不好对付
We struggled with the X-23s.

1113
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:43,300
我们本以为能把这些孩子
We assumed, because they were children...

1114
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,760
从小培养成冷血杀手
we could raise them without a conscience.

1115
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:46,690
可愤怒是无法后天培养的
But you can't nurture rage.

1116
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:48,020
你必须从一开始就为他
You must simply design it...

1117
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:49,230
设定好
from scratch.

1118
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:59,200
那又是该死的谁
Who the fuck is that?

1119
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:05,370
威尔·芒森
Will Munson!

1120
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:09,910
坚持住 查尔斯
Just hold on, Charles.

1121
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:12,710
芒森 该死的 给我出来
Munson, God damn it, come out here!

1122
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:18,020
芒森
Munson!

1123
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:21,220
快给我出来
Come out here now!

1124
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:23,480
给我滚出来 芒森
Come out here now, Munson.

1125
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:24,960
是刚才那个混蛋
There's that asshole.

1126
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,290
你好 混蛋
Hello, asshole.

1127
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,400
听着 过去的事我就不计较了
Listen, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

1128
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,500
我不知道芒森那家伙付你多少钱
I don't know what Munson's paying you...

1129
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,730
我们坎伍德现在给你5000美元
but Canewood can start you out at five G.

1130
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:37,900
我指一星期
A week, that is.

1131
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:42,110
你最好待着别动 兄弟
You best stay where you are, pal.

1132
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:44,010
我就是这里的法律
I'm the law out here.

1133
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,610
不 不 不
No, no, no.

1134
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:49,080
天杀的
What in high...

1135
01:26:50,850 --> 01:26:52,690
我靠
What? Oh, shit!

1136
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:53,890
快开枪
Shoot him!

1137
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:56,950
我们得介入了
We need to intervene.

1138
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,360
可他只听你的话 博士
Well, he only listens to you, Doctor.

1139
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:03,420
24!

快按住伤口 按紧
Hold this down, right now, tight!

1143
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:16,140
- 我们的船  - 什么
- Our boat.  - What?

1144
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:23,710
逐日号
The Sunseeker.

1145
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,360
不
No.

1146
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,240
回来

1147
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,530

1149
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:50,390
看来我们得出手了
I guess we're gonna have to take care of this now.

1150
01:27:50,410 --> 01:27:51,930
- 皮尔斯  - 把那个给我
- Pierce!  - Give me that.

1151
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,760
你到底在磨蹭什么
Get your lily-faced ass out here!

1152
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,150
听到没
Listen to me!

1153
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:02,920
你到底在干什么
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1154
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:04,910
我们绕过那辆卡车
All right, we gotta go around that truck

1155
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:06,220
从侧面袭击
and flank them farmers.

1156
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:07,730
听我指挥
Follow my lead.

1157
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:09,700
多带点子弹 把这些弹夹都带上

1158

给我

01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,260
回来
Now!

1160
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,500
把她带上
Pick her up.

1161
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:26,510
小心光
Beware the light.

1162
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:51,070
你到底是什么
What the hell are you?

1163
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:19,350
坐下
Sit down.

1164
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,900
别乱动
Hold still.

1165
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:41,640
别乱动
Hold still.

1166
01:32:03,770 --> 01:32:04,890
把他抬到卡车上去

1167
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:05,940

1170
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,420
你做得很好 24
It's all right. You did fine, 24.

1171
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:21,480
你正在愈合 保持呼吸
You're healing. Just breathe.

1172
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:25,420
严格来说 你还只是个新生儿
You're a newborn, by any measure.

1173
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:26,850
保持呼吸
Just breathe.

1174
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:28,380
你的身体还有许多工作要完成
Your body has work to do.

1175
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:31,120
它需要止血 生成血管 还有表皮
Hemostasis, angiogenesis, epithelialization...

1176
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:32,630
增生基质细胞
stromal cell proliferation.

1177
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:36,290
这能帮助你恢复

让你变得更强

1179
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:34,950

01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:42,760
这里也算得上是傍水了
It's got water, and...

1181
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,120
至少有水
It's got water.

1182
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:26,270
该死的 该死的
Fuck this. Fuck this.

1183
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:41,950

欢迎回来
Welcome back.

1193
01:35:49,530 --> 01:35:51,440
我刚才还在想 是不是该告诉
I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell...

1194
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:53,340
休息室那小女孩儿
that nice little girl out in the waiting room...

1195
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:54,930
她爸爸醒不过来了
her daddy's gone.

1196
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:02,260
我一直希望
I'd always hoped...

1197
01:36:03,070 --> 01:36:07,510
能有机会遇到像你这样的人
that I'd get the chance to meet someone like you.

1198
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:09,540
你的同类已经不多了
There's so few of you left.

1199
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,210
我也很高兴认识你 医生
Nice to meet you, too, Doc.

1200
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:15,760
可我必须得赶路了
But I really got to get on my way.

1201
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:16,950
不 不 不 别这样
No, no, don't do that.

1202
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:19,550
你需要休息 还有治疗

1203
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,300
你需要找个地方检查一下

1204

- 我没事  - 不 你有事
- I'll be fine.  - No, you're not!

1205
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:26,930
我是说 我知道你与众不同
I mean, I know that you're different...

1206
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:28,370
不过这也无法改变
but that doesn't change the fact

1207
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,370
你体内有东西在荼毒你的事实
that something inside you is poisoning you.

1208
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:32,760
你得找家医院检查一下
You got to check yourself into a hospital.

1209
01:36:32,970 --> 01:36:34,600
看看到底怎么回事

1210
01:36:35,070 --> 01:36:36,230
我知道怎么回事
I know what it is.

1211
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:39,400
求你了先生 如果你不想去医院的话
Please, mister, if you don't want to go to a hospital,

1212
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:40,510
或许我可以帮你

1213
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:41,870
我可以帮你做测试
Maybe I can run some tests.

1214
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,410
听着 医生 你看起来是个好人
Look, Doc. You seem like a nice guy, all right?

1215
01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:46,280
如果你想要救人的话 救你自己吧
You wanna save a life, save your own.

1216
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:47,480
忘了我们来过这儿
Forget we were here.

1217
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:48,740
我们走
Let's go.

1218
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:24,950
你不能随便拿别人的
You can't just take shit, you know.

1219
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:45,700
我不知道你怎么带我来这儿的
I don't know how you got me here...

1220

不过谢谢

You can talk?

What's all this bullshit been

1228
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:03,830
你一个字都不说

01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:09,350
大动干戈啊
like you did in Juárez.

1281
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,700
你可别忘了
Well, try to remind yourselves

1282
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,100
这些都是杀人机器
that these are all little killing machines.

1283
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:14,170
轻易就能杀掉你全家
Machines who would've happily disemboweled your family.

1284
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:15,190
不都是啊
Not all.

1285
01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:18,160
我跟你说了把他们解决掉
I was told you want these assets off-board,

1286
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:19,350
不管死活
dead or alive.

1287
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,760
你改了我的命令吗
Are you changing my brief?

1288
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:21,960
没有
No.

1289
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:23,460
那还废什么话
All right, then.

1290
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:26,430
提取他的细胞组织
Save tissue from this one.

1291
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:28,700
他擅长追踪 具有高智商
He's a good tracker and had a high IQ.

1292
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:35,480
拿去吧
Here you go.

1293
01:41:22,290 --> 01:41:23,570
让我开
Let me drive.

1294
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,490
那可不行
Absolutely not.

1295
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:34,730
别盯着我看
Quit looking at me.

1296
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:40,400
听不懂
No comprende.

1297
01:41:41,910 --> 01:41:43,400
你快死了
You are dying.

1298
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,750
你想死
You want to die.

1299
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:52,120
查尔斯告诉我的
Charles told me.

1300
01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:57,450
他还告诉了你什么
What else did he tell you?

1301
01:41:57,930 --> 01:41:59,450
别让你死
To not let you.

1302
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:21,680
休息吧
Rest.

1303
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:07,740
稳住
Keep it steady.

1304
01:45:10,090 --> 01:45:11,640
往我这边来点
Swing him toward me.

1305
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:15,190
好
Yeah.

1306
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,920
慢点
Easy. Easy

1307
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:54,860
这样可以吗 瑞克多
Is this good, Rictor?

1308
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:56,530
不用那么多 少点儿
No, not so much. Less.

1309
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,110
我在哪儿
Where am I?

1310
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:15,680
这是什么
Hey, what is it?

1311
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:17,350
从哪儿弄来的
Where did you get that?

1312
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:18,850
从我们来的地方
Where we came from.

1313
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,520
战斗时
They gave it to us

1314
01:46:20,590 --> 01:46:21,730
他们给我们这个 让我们变得更强
when we would fight. It makes you stronger.

1315
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,520
那东西只会让你发狂
It makes you crazy, is what it does.

1316
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:24,660
还会杀了你
It'll kill you.

1317
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:26,730
不 如果你控制好剂量的话
No, not if you use it in small doses.

1318
01:46:27,430 --> 01:46:28,690
它会帮你恢复
It's helping you heal.

1319
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,500
劳拉在哪儿
Where's Laura?

1320
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:33,640
她在下面睡着了
She's asleep down there.

1321
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,670
要我叫醒她吗
Do you want me to wake her up?

1322
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:44,510
不
No.

1323
01:47:05,770 --> 01:47:07,430
你做噩梦了
You had a nightmare.

1324
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:13,070
你会做噩梦吗
Do you have nightmares?

1325
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:15,440
会
Sí.

1326
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,180
梦里有人会伤害我
People hurt me.

1327
01:47:22,290 --> 01:47:23,750
我的不一样
Mine are different.

1328
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,360
梦里我伤害了别人
I hurt people.

1329
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:40,300
这个是什么

1330
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:50,740
你知道这是什么吗
You know what it is.

1331
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:54,480
这是用艾德曼合金做的
It's made out of Adamantium.

1332
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:57,480
就是他们注入我们体内的东西
It's what they put inside of us.

1333
01:47:58,450 --> 01:48:00,220
所以它能杀死我们
That's why it can kill us.

1334
01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:04,390
或许正是它在要我的命
Probably what is killing me now.

1335
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:07,720
反正
Anyway...

1336
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:10,060
这是我很久以前得到的
I got this a long time ago...

1337
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:14,940
我留着它是想提醒我 自己究竟是谁
and I kept it as a reminder of what I am.

1338
01:48:17,210 --> 01:48:19,110
现在我留着...
Now I keep it to, uh...

1339
01:48:26,050 --> 01:48:27,310
实话说
Actually, uh...

1340
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:33,020
我想过用它来自杀
I was thinking of shooting myself with it.

1341
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:35,120
查尔斯说得没错
Like Charles said.

1342
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:42,830
我也伤害过人
I've hurt people, too.

1343
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:48,670
你得学会如何面对这种感觉
You're gonna have to learn how to live with that.

1344
01:48:58,250 --> 01:49:00,220
他们都是坏人
They were bad people.

1345
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:05,680
并没有差别
All the same.

1346
01:50:20,730 --> 01:50:22,960
不好玩 这一点都不好玩
Not funny. That is not funny!

1347
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:25,930
嘿 小子
Hey! Hey, pal.

1348
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:28,430
我睡了多久了
How long have I been out?

1349
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:31,350
我在床上躺了多久了
How long have I been in that bed?

1350
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,700
两天
Two days.

1351
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:34,220
你们就在这儿守了两天？
You've been sitting here for two days?

1352
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:35,820
进去告诉大家可以开始打包了
Hey, go inside and tell everyone to get packing.

1353
01:50:35,850 --> 01:50:37,560
你们不能这样 不能坐以待毙
You can't do that. You can't just stay here.

1354
01:50:37,580 --> 01:50:39,450
我们必须等待 计划就是这样的
We had to wait. It was the plan.

1355
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:41,910
今天是我们集合的最后一天
And everyone had till today to find their way here.

1356
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:43,120
再等下去
If you keep waiting,

1357
01:50:43,190 --> 01:50:44,760
阿尔卡利会找到你们 然后把你们全部杀掉
Alkali will find you and they will kill you all.

1358
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:45,790
你们得离开这儿
You need to get out!

1359
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,980
明天天亮前我们就走
We're leaving tomorrow before dawn.

1360
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:49,980
我们会穿过边界去加拿大
We're gonna cross the border.

1361
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:51,750
那里有避难所
It's a safe haven.

1362
01:50:53,030 --> 01:50:54,220
请确认坐标
Same coordinates?

1363
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:56,590
已确认 正午到五点之间
Yes, between noon and 5:00.

1364
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,130
那会儿卫星也看不到
Satellites are blind then.

1365
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:01,570
- 你们的庇护要求已批准  - 收到
- Your asylum approved.  - Copy.

1366
01:51:17,690 --> 01:51:19,310
你往右边看 劳拉
Swing it to your right, Laura.

1367
01:51:22,830 --> 01:51:24,620
再往右一点 对
A little more. Yeah.

1368
01:51:24,830 --> 01:51:26,160
看到树林了吗
You see the woods?

1369
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:29,300
嗯
Sí.

1370
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:31,380
要走8英里才能到那儿
It's an eight mile hike through there.

1371
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:33,660
看到那条通道没
And you see that pass?

1372
01:51:35,170 --> 01:51:36,260
那就是边界
That's the border.

1373
01:51:38,210 --> 01:51:40,000
到那里我们就安全了
That's where we will be safe.

1374
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:48,840
进来吧
Come inside.

1375
01:51:55,730 --> 01:51:57,250
劳拉告诉我你为她所做的一切
Laura told me all that you did for her.

1376
01:51:57,730 --> 01:51:59,720
她很幸运有你在她身边
She was lucky to have you.

1377
01:52:02,230 --> 01:52:04,130
拿着吧 她说这是你的
Take it. She says it's yours.

1378
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:08,560
这也是你送她来的目的吧
That's why you did it, right?

1379
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:12,570
对 好吧
Yeah, well...

1380
01:52:13,410 --> 01:52:16,170
可我不需要了 你们留着吧
Look, I don't need it. You do, okay?

1381
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:18,210
随你便吧
Suit yourself.

1382
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,020
能给我一个吗
Can I have one.

1383
01:52:28,470 --> 01:52:29,700
- 给  - 谢谢
- Here.  - Thanks.

1384
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:41,500
你的朋友们看起来不错
Your friends, they seem nice.

1385
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:42,700
让我想起了当年
Kind of reminds me...

1386
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:45,840
发生什么事了
Hey, hey, what's going on?

1387
01:52:48,940 --> 01:52:50,300
你已经找到同伴了
You're with your pals. You made it.

1388
01:52:51,310 --> 01:52:52,780
你要去哪里
Where will you go?

1389
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,380
先去最近的酒吧看看
Nearest bar, for starters.

1390
01:52:56,790 --> 01:52:59,190
我已经把你送到了 我的使命完成了
Hey, I got you here. That's all I signed up for.

1391
01:52:59,390 --> 01:53:01,220
我还把钱还给你了
I even gave back the money.

1392
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:02,450
你还真是个好人
Such a nice man.

1393
01:53:02,590 --> 01:53:04,750
这并不是我想要的
Hey, I never asked for this!

1394
01:53:05,490 --> 01:53:07,220
懂吗 这也不是查尔斯想要的
All right? Charles never asked for this.

1395
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:09,290
这也不是卡利班想要的
Caliban never asked for this.

1396
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:12,120
现在他们都躺在了土里
And they are six feet under the ground!

1397
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:15,260
我不知道查尔斯给你灌输了什么
Now, I don't know what Charles put in your head...

1398
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,200
反正我不是你心里想的那样 懂吗
but I am not whatever it is you think I am, okay?

1399
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:21,870
我认识你不过一个星期
I only met you, like, a week ago.

1400
01:53:23,110 --> 01:53:25,050
你找到了你的丽贝卡 你的黛利拉
You got your Rebecca, your Delilah...

1401
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:26,910
还有其他乱七八糟的人
your blah, blah, blah, whatever.

1402
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:28,710
你想要的都已经得到了
Everything you asked for, you've got it!

1403
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:33,650
而且这样更好
And it is better this way.

1404
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,060
因为我总是搞砸
Because I suck at this.

1405
01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:41,890
厄运总会降临在我在乎的人身上
Bad shit happens to people I care about.

1406
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:43,720
你懂吗
You understand me?

1407
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:47,400
我不会有事的
Then I'll be fine.

1408
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:58,300
快跑 往山里跑 快跑
Run! Towards the mountains! Run!

1409
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:09,700
快跑 罗比 快跑
Run, Bobby, run!

1410
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:35,330
快 快
Go! Go!

1411
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
再快点
Move faster!

1412
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:39,210
在他们越过边界前 我们得抓住他们
We need to reach them before they get to the border.

1413
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:57,270
行动
Move out!

1414
01:58:57,480 --> 01:58:58,480
我们走 我们走
Let's go, let's go!

1415
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:01,750
跑 快跑
Run! Run!

1416
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:04,480
科尔 约拿 快跑
Corre, Jonah! Run!

1417
01:59:11,130 --> 01:59:12,620
尽量呼吸
I want you to breathe.

1418
01:59:12,830 --> 01:59:14,090
只是皮肉伤 小子
It's just a flesh wound, baby.

1419
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:31,380
她在这儿
There she is.

1420
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:32,810
抓住她了
We got her.

1421
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:37,410
后退 围住她
Back it up! Contain her.

1422
02:00:04,050 --> 02:00:05,050
躲在我身后
Get behind me!

1423
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:28,370
你把药全用上了
You took all the medicine.

1424
02:00:30,010 --> 02:00:31,170
药效就快退了
It's wearing off.

1425
02:00:57,970 --> 02:00:59,260
到你朋友那儿去
Go to your friends.

1426
02:01:00,570 --> 02:01:01,570
去吧
Go.

1427
02:01:03,070 --> 02:01:04,160
劳拉
Laura?

1428
02:01:06,210 --> 02:01:07,510
我会告诉你时机
You'll know when.

1429
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:20,880
九点方向
Nine o'clock.

1430
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:25,190
绿色液体的药效快没了吧
That green juice is wearin' off, huh?

1431
02:01:26,230 --> 02:01:28,720
看来对于老变种人来说药效还真短
You know, for an old mute, it's kind of a short high.

1432
02:01:29,230 --> 02:01:30,720
很快你会连爪子都神不出来
Be hard to keep them claws out, soon.

1433
02:01:30,930 --> 02:01:32,730
灭了这混蛋 罗根
Waste this dick, Logan!

1434
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,700
请住手 豪利特先生
Please stop, Mr. Howlett.

1435
02:01:36,170 --> 02:01:37,280
不然我就得下令
I'm gonna have to tell these men

1436
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:38,350
朝孩子们开火了
to fire on these children.

1437
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:39,800
你也不想这样吧
You don't want that.

1438
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,310
你也知道血清的药效很快就没了
You can see the effects of the serum are wearing off.

1439
02:01:42,510 --> 02:01:45,070
再受伤的话你就活不成了
You will not survive further wounds.

1440
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:46,870
请允许我自我介绍一下
Allow me to introduce myself.

1441
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:48,280
我叫桑德尔·莱斯
I'm Zander Rice.

1442
02:01:49,450 --> 02:01:51,530
我想你应在X武器项目中见过我父亲
I believe you knew my father on the Weapon X Program.

1443
02:01:51,690 --> 02:01:55,210
没错 就是那个混蛋把毒药注入我体内的
Yeah. He's the asshole who put this poison in me.

1444
02:01:56,290 --> 02:01:57,720
对 混蛋之一
Yes, he was one of them.

1445
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:00,890
那他应该已经被我杀了
I think I might have killed him.

1446
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:03,320
你说得没错
I think you're right.

1447
02:02:03,470 --> 02:02:04,990
放尊重些 变种人
Why don't you show some respect, mutie?

1448
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:06,990
你眼前的这位可是消灭了所有变种人的人
You're lookin' at the man who wiped out your kind.

1449
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:09,470
我的朋友唐纳德言过其实了
My friend Donald overstates.

1450
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:13,240
他把事情说得过分残忍了
He makes it sound more brutal than intended.

1451
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:16,640
我的目的不是消灭变种人
The goal was not to end mutant kind...

1452
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:18,110
而是掌控他们
but to control it.

1453
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:21,340
我意识到
I realized

1454
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:23,130
我们不该放弃在饮食上的研发
we needn't stop perfecting what we eat and drink.

1455
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:24,200
我们可以用这些产品
That we could use those products

1456
02:02:24,220 --> 02:02:25,240
来完善自己
to perfect ourselves.

1457
02:02:26,390 --> 02:02:27,650
从饮料到谷物早餐
To distribute gene therapy

1458
02:02:27,790 --> 02:02:29,090
在每样东西中
discreetly through everything...

1459
02:02:29,290 --> 02:02:31,450
谨慎地进行基因治疗
from sweet drinks to breakfast cereals.

1460
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:32,750
而且成功了
And it worked.

1461
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:35,430
随机出现的变种基因 就像小儿麻痹一样被扼杀了
Random mutancy went the way of polio.

1462
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:36,910
然后我们开始了下一步
We embarked on our next endeavor.

1463
02:02:37,130 --> 02:02:38,690
培育你们自己的变种人
Growing mutants of your own.

1464
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:39,980
- 正是  - 世道艰难
- Precisely. - Dangerous times, James.

1465
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,000
你不能
You can't...

1466
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:01,020
该你上场了 小子
Showtime, boy!

1467
02:03:37,730 --> 02:03:39,560
起来 小子 起来 小子
Get up, boy. Get up, boy!

1468
02:03:44,530 --> 02:03:45,690
是他杀的 快起来
He did that. Get up!

1469
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:00,710
劳拉 不
Laura! No!

1470
02:04:05,790 --> 02:04:06,790
劳拉
Laura!

1471
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:55,270
饶命
Please.

1472
02:05:38,980 --> 02:05:39,980
快走
Go.

1473
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:42,550
走吧
Let's go.

1474
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:44,080
快走
Go.

1475
02:05:45,550 --> 02:05:47,020
快 快 快
Go, go, go!

1476
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:49,950
快走 离开这儿 快
Go! Get out of here! Go!

1477
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:55,790
快走 快 快 快
Go. Go, go, go!

1478
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:01,630
快走
Go, go!

1479
02:06:01,870 --> 02:06:02,870
快走
Go!

1480
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:04,330
快跑
Run!

1481
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:05,540
不
No!

1482
02:06:06,370 --> 02:06:07,810
不
No!

1483
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:46,910
不 不 不
No, no. No.

1484
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:13,570
带上你的朋友 快跑
Take your friends, and run.

1485
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:14,940
不
No.

1486
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:18,270
他们还会派人来追杀你们
Run. They'll keep coming and coming.

1487
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:21,110
听着 你们不必再战斗了
Listen, you don't have to fight anymore.

1488
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:27,450
走
Go, go.

1489
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:37,060
别成为他们所希望的那样
Don't be what they made you.

1490
02:07:45,110 --> 02:07:47,270
劳拉 劳拉
Laura... Laura...

1491
02:07:51,710 --> 02:07:52,810
爸爸
Daddy.

1492
02:08:02,290 --> 02:08:04,920
原来 死亡是这种感觉
So, this is what it feels like.

1493
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
不
No!

1494
02:08:15,870 --> 02:08:16,870
不
No!

1495
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:31,550
爸爸
Daddy.

1496
02:08:32,390 --> 02:08:33,390
爸爸
Dad.

1497
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:08,120
人必须忠于自己 乔伊
"A man has to be what he is, Joey.

1498
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:11,150
不能违背自己的本性
"Can't break the mold.

1499
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:16,530
带着杀戮活下去很难
"There's no living with a killing.

1500
02:09:17,700 --> 02:09:19,560
这条路没有退路
"There's no going back.

1501
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:23,640
是对是错 你都得背负
"Right or wrong, it's a brand.

1502
02:09:24,540 --> 02:09:26,400
直至一生
"A brand that sticks.

1503

现在快回去找你妈妈
"Now you run on home to your mother.

1504
02:09:33,050 --> 02:09:36,480
告诉她一切都好
"You tell her everything's all right.

1505
02:09:38,090 --> 02:09:41,390
山谷里再也不会有枪声了
"There are no more guns in the valley."

1506
02:09:58,270 --> 02:10:00,240
走吧 继续上路
Let's go. We gotta move.

1507
