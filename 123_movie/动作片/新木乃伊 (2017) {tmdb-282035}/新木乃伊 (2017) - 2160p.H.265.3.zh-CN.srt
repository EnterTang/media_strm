考古学教授        罗宾・约翰逊

12
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,200
由于伊斯兰教义中明确禁止偶像崇拜  因此在伊拉克有不少古迹
因为雕塑的原因被极端分子毁坏

13
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,800
横贯铁路  开始运营后名称定为“伊利莎伯线”
是英国伦敦一条建筑中的客运铁路  其兴建旨在提供频密的通勤和市郊与市中心接驳铁路

不知道
I don't know.

横贯铁路是全欧洲最大的建设项目

新通勤铁路需要在伦敦地下
Carving 26 miles of new commuter train tunnels

31
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,480
挖掘长达42公里的隧道
beneath the surface of London.

32
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,900
但今日  一个满是十字军骑士棺椁的墓穴
But today, an ancient tomb filled with the coffins of crusader knights...

33
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,020
人们总是意识不到伦敦就是一座大墓园
People don't realize that London is a giant graveyard.

34
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,010
是一座建在成百上千年死尸上的现代都市
A modern city built on centuries of death.

35
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,730
由于墓穴靠近泰晤士河
Because of the tombs proximity to the Thames...

36
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,700
其一半的空间被水淹没  是这样吗  博士
...half the space is flooded, is that right doctor?

37
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,180
还有更多的棺椁被淹没在水中
There are even more coffins submerged under water.

38
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,980
这座墓穴似乎是建于第二次十字军东征期间
The tomb appears to have been built during the second Crusade...

39
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,630
这意味着棺椁里的尸体属于
...which means it's filled with the bodies of crusader knights who invaded Egypt...

40
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,070
未能活着回来的入侵埃及的十字军骑士
...before returning to England.

41
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,890
这次发现同样接露了伦敦一段尘封的历史
It has also revealed a treasure trove of secrets about London's history.

42
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,560
把他们清出去
Clear them out, please.

43
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,750
女士们先生们  请停下你们手头的事
Ladies and gentlemen, please stop what you are doing.

44
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,890
火车隧道已经从北面改道
The train tunnel has been rerouted north of here.

45
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,040
现在由我们来接手这个现场
We are now taking control of this site.

46
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,360
请收好你们的工具立刻离开
Please collect your tools and gear and exit immediately.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,930
不好意思  打扰一下
Excuse me. Excuse me.

48
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,250
这是我的工地  你这是在做什么
This is my site. What do you think you are doing?

49
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,940
把你的人撤出去  我们来接管这个现场
Evacuate your men. We'll take it from here.

50
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,710
你们是什么人
Who the hell are you people?

51
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,460
这边走  先生  非常感谢
This way, sir. Thank you very much.

52

往事无法永久被尘封
The past cannot remain buried forever.

53
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,920
在我的一生中  我发掘过不少
In my lifetime, I have unearth...

54
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,410
古代的秘宝
...many ancient mysteries.

55
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,290
最终  这座墓穴
At last, this tomb...

56
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,790
会接露古迹最黑暗的秘密
...reveals antiquities darkest secret.

57
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,340
一个被从历史中抹去
A secret erased from history...

58
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,880
并被时间所遗忘的秘密
...and forgotten to time.

59
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,580
安玛奈特公主
Princess Ahmanet.

60
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,210
美丽
Beautiful...

61
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,110
狡黠
...cunning...

62
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,430
无情
...and ruthless.

63
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,710
是埃及王位的唯一继承人
Sole heir to the throne of Egypt.

64
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,200
法老王国终有一天将受她冷酷无畏
The Pharaohs kingdom will one day be hers to rule...

65
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,590
的铁腕控制
...without mercy or fear.

66
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,510
而安玛奈特会被当作神来供奉
And Ahmanet would be worshipped as a living God.

67
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,410
但是法老有了个儿子
But Pharaoh had a son.

68
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,860
现在  那个男孩会继承她的命运
The boy now, would inherit her destiny.

69
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,070
安玛奈特明白权利不能被赠予
And Ahmanet understood power was not given...

70
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,840
只能被夺取
...it had to be taken.

71
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,750
她宣誓要复仇
Vowing revenge...

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,870
她选择拥抱邪恶
...she made a choice to embrace evil.

73
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,830
与赛特
Seth.

74
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,990
死亡之神
The God of death.

75
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,630
达成协议
They made a pact.

76
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,700
一个释放黑暗本身的协议
A pact that would unleash darkness itself.

77
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,890
安玛奈特重生
Ahmanet was reborn...

78
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,080
成为一个怪物
...a monster.

79
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,300
然而协议并未完成
Yet the pact was not complete.

80
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,440
她发誓要将恶魔以人身
She vowed to bring the demon into our world...

81
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,370
带到这个世界
...in the body of a mortal man.

82
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,510
他们将携手向人类展开复仇
Together, they would take their vengeance upon humanity.

83
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,490
由于她的罪孽  安玛奈特被活着制成木乃伊
For her sins, Ahmanet was mummified alive.

84
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,760
她的尸体被转移到远离埃及的地方
Her body carried far from Egypt.

85
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,530
在那里她将被囚禁于永世的黑暗之中
There she would remain, condemned to eternal darkness.

86
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,600
但死亡不过是条门径
But death is a doorway...

87
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,280
过往无法被永远尘封
...and the past cannot remain buried forever.

88
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,240
不走运啊  军士
Out of luck, ah Sarge?

89
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,860
平民都离开了
The civilians are gone.

90
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,340
那里全是叛乱分子
Is filled with insurgents down there.

91
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,870
我们也许来晚了
I guess we're too late.

92
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,460
我们能做到
We can do this.

93
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
哦  不  不  不  我们来得太晚了
Oh no no no! We're too late!

94
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,200
指挥部认为我们在离这161公里的
Command thinks we are doing advanced recon...

95
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,370
地方做前敌侦察呢
...a 100 miles from here.

96
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,150
军士  你不能到那下边去
Sarge, you are not going down there.

97
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,290
你说得没错  我不能这么下去  我们一起下去
You're right. I'm not. We are.

98
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,350
- 至少请求一次空袭  - 空袭
- At least call in an air strike. - Air Strike?

99
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
坏主意
Bad idea.

100
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,070
来个小规模的  也许能把他们吓跑
A little one. Just maybe they'll run off.

101
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,680
你觉得指挥部会知道我们在哪
You think command will know where we are.

102
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,050
我们会因为洗劫古董在管教营蹲20年
And then we will do 20 years in Leavenworth for looting.

103
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,960
我之前是怎么和你说的  我们不是强盗
Hey, what did I tell you? Hey, We are not looters.

104
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,080
我们是珍贵古物的解放者
We are liberators of precious antiquities.

105
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,180
- 没错  - 没错
- Right. - Right.

106
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,530
但我们根本不知道那下面有什么
But we don't even know what's down there.

107
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,690
圣地  圣地就是那下面的东西  宝藏
Haram. Haram is what's down there. Treasure.

108
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,830
不  圣地的意思是禁忌的知识
No, the translator said "Haram" means "forbidden knowledge".

109
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
像是诅咒
Like a curse.

110
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,250
如果是在这种地方提起来那就是宝藏的代名词
Around here that's just another word for "treasure."

111
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,410
而且这个家伙  这个叫亨利的家伙
And this guy, this.. Henry guy...

112
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,070
似乎很想要这个东西
...it seems to want it pretty bad.

113
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,640
那么  现在他就得付双倍的价钱
Well.. now he is gonna have to pay double.

114
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,720
- 上马吧  - 不  长官  我才不打算参与这件事
- Mount up. - "No, sir, I ain't going on this one."

115
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
- 什么  - 我不去
- What? - I'm not going.

116
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,090
维尔
Vail.

117
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,520
你打算怎么做  拿那玩意扎我吗
What are you going to do? "Stab me with that?"

118
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,720
哦  别这样
Oh no no no no.. No!

119
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,100
你这个疯犊子
You crazy bastard.

120
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,750
到最近的水源地要一天的时间呢
It's a full days ride to the nearest water!

121
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,380
最近的水源就在山坡下的村子里
The nearest water is right down in that village.

122
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,090
快来呀  维尔
Come on, Vail.

123
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,780
你的冒险精神哪去了
Where is your sense of adventure?

124
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,430
那真是太好了  尼克  真是太好了
Oh that's just great, Nick! That's just great!

125
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,180
快来  我们快进快出  就像我们往常那样
Come on, we slip in - slip out, just like we always do.

126
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,540
你这个混球
You son of a bitch!

127
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
我的老天
Oh my God!

128
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,400
我们要死了  我们要死了
We are gonna die.. we are gonna die!

129
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,510
快  快
Move! Move.

130
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,140
只管跑  快跑
Just run.. run run.

131
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,510
快  快  快走
Let's go! Go.. go!

132
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,520
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

133
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,180
快进快出
"Slip in - slip out"?

134
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,890
这可和说好的剧本不一样
This is not what we always do!

135
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,690
上楼梯  快跑  跑
Stairs! Just run! Run!

136
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,230
快  快  快
Run! Run! Run!

137
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,910
手雷
Grenade!

138
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,210
我恨你  我恨死你了
I hate you, I hate you so much!

139
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,090
我就从来没想来  来这个国家
I never even wanted to come.. to this country!

140
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,170
让我想想  让我想想
Let me think. Just let me think.

141
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,710
如果有人在听的话
If anyone is listening...

142
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,230
这里是L-26  请求空中支援
...this is L-26, RMJ Hot!

143
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,120
请求向我所在位置进行精确空袭
Request dynamic precision strike at our mark!

144
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,820
你不会  刚刚要求向这里进行空袭把
You did not.. just called in an air strike!

145
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,160
没错  我要求的
Oh.. yes.. I.. did!

146
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,070
你要去哪  别丢下我
Where are you going? Don't leave me!

147
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,660
他们都是从哪冒出来的
Where do they keep coming from?

148
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,930
没路可逃了
There is nowhere to go!

149
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,740
老兄  我们要死了
Oh man we are gonna die!

150
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,780
拜托你 维尔  让我好好想想
Please, Vail! Let me think!

151
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,270
我们要因为你死在这了
We are gonna die because of you!

152
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,270
让我想想
Just let me think!

153
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,360
想什么  想什么
Think about what? Think about what?

154
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,010
我在想
I'm thinking...

155
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,940
什么
What?

156
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
我在想
I'm thinking...

157
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,950
你在想什么
What are you thinking?

158
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,660
我在想  我们可能要死在这了
I'm thinking.. we are probably gonna die here.

159
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,430
我就知道
I knew it!

160
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,610
我就知道
I knew it!

161
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,120
我还活着
I am still alive!

162
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,530
尼克
Nick!

163
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,050
圣地
Haram.

164
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,380
我被告知你们在离这100英里以外的地方
I was told you boys were supposed to be a 100 clicks from here!

165
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,030
是的  长官  但是根据情报
Yes, sir! But based on intelligence...

166
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,250
我们有理由相信叛乱分子劫持了平民作为人质
...we had reason to believe the insurgents were holding civilian hostages.

167
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,620
我们必须当机立断
We had to make the call.

168
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,800
是等三角洲部队来  还是单枪匹马闯进去
Wait for Delta team to respond or go in alone.

169
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,290
事实上冲进去是莫顿军士的主意
It was Sergeant Morton's idea to go in actually!

170
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,280
结果发现平民早就撤离了
Only to find out that the villagers had long since evacuated.

171
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,730
他们走运了  我们则不然
Yeah lucky for them, not for us.

172
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,510
三角洲部队  到南边去
Delta, south side perimeter.

173
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,600
长官  当我们意识到我们闯进叛乱分子据点时
Sir, when we realized that we were at the center of the insurgents stronghold...

174
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,680
已经来不及了
...it was too late.

175
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,510
我们被发现之后  遭到猛烈攻击
We were discovered, we started taking on heavy fire.

176
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,050
长官  虽然维尔下士出于谦虚没有说
Well.. Sir, Corporal Vail here is too humble to admit it...

177
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,050
但是他冒着性命危险救了我
But he risked his life to save mine.

178
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,020
他是个英雄  事实上我想推荐他接受表彰
He is a hero, in fact.. I'd like to recommend him for a citation.

179
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,640
让我给你们说说我的剧本
Let me run another scenario of mine.

180
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,650
长官
Sir?

181
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,610
有两个隶属于远距离侦察部队的混球
One in which two assholes from long range reconnaissance...

182
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,990
就是你们
...that would be you...

183
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,540
穿过伊拉克北部  先于敌人一步
...run all over northern Iraq, just one step ahead of the enemy.

184
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,820
只是  你们并不是在追踪敌人
Except, instead of hunting for the enemy...

185
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,950
他们是在追踪古董
...you hunt for antiquities...

186
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,290
偷走所有能够拿得走的的东西然后将这些东西放到黑市上去卖
...stealing whatever isn't nailed down and selling it on the black market.

187
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,810
与此同时  这些狂热的叛乱分子
Meanwhile, these fanatical insurgents...

188
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,200
正试图毁坏有五千年历史的古迹
...trying to erase 5,000 years of history...

189
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,510
无意之中为你们掩盖了行踪  故事编得真不错
...unwillingly cover your tracks. It's a pretty good scam.

190
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,770
莫顿军士
Sergeant Morton!

191
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,250
在哪里
Where is it?

192
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,430
什么  什么在哪里
What? Where is what?

193
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,530
那个信封  那幅你从我这偷走的地图
The letter. The map you stole from me.

194
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,010
地图  我不知道你在说什么
Map? I do not know what you are talking about.

195
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:55,960
我怎么会
How would I...

196
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,980
有从你身边偷走任何东西的机会  这位
had even had the opportunity to steal anything from you, Miss...?

197
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,920
这位女士
Miss...

198
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,780
好吧  莫顿军士认为我会碍于颜面
Ok.. Sgt. Morton here thinks that I would be too embarrassed..

199
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,580
没办法告诉你们三天前的晚上
...to tell you that I had him in my hotel room...

200
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,160
在巴格达我请他去了我的旅馆房间
...3 nights ago, in Baghdad.

201
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,270
趁着我睡着的时候  他翻了我的东西
And whilst I was sleeping, he went through my things.

202
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,640
我不觉得尴尬  尼克
I'm not embarrassed, Nick.

203
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,990
恶心吗  当然  后悔吗  必须地
Disgusted? Yes. Regretful? Ah certainly.

204
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,190
但主要是被你的能力  惊艳到
But mainly just amazed, to your ability...

205
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,310
把人类真实的亲密行为模仿的如此形象
...to mimic all the qualities of genuine human intimacy...

206
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,060
虽然只有  十五秒
...if only for.. 15 seconds?

207
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,920
莫顿  地图藏哪了
Where is the map, Morton?

208
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,130
长官  我承认
Sir, I admit that...

209
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,930
我和哈尔西小姐在巴格达度过了美妙的一晚
...Miss Halsey and I did spend a delightful evening in Baghdad.

210
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,370
漫长又满足的一晚
A very long and satisfying evening...

211
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,090
假设她的反应是真实的
...if her reactions are to be considered sincere.

212
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,480
但是长官  除了美好的回忆我什么都没带走
But Sir, I left with nothing more than fond memories.

213
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,830
也许我第二天早上忘记和她道别了
Now, perhaps I may have neglected to say goodbye to her the next morning...

214
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,610
只是因为她太累了
...only because she was exhausted...

215
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,490
- 我不想吵醒她  - 行了
- .. and I did not want to wake her. - Ok.

216
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,600
可她对我体贴关心的回报呢
And the reward for my gracious consideration?

217
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,890
长官  如您所见  千万别得罪女人
Well Sir, as you can see "Hell hath no fury".

218
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,450
- 长官  - 天  快来看
- Sir. - Oh my God!

219
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,370
这是埃及遗迹
It's Egyptian.

220
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,220
这有什么奇怪的吗
Why is that unusual?

221
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,790
这里可是波斯湾  维尔
We are in the Persian Gulf, Vail.

222
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,930
也对  埃及距离这里有1600公里远因此才奇怪
Right. Egypt is a 1000 miles away so it's unusual.

223
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,060
放地上  快  去拿剩余装备
Put those down, hurry. Go get the rest.

224
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,070
好
Got it.

225
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,370
上校  这是一项重大发现  请你派人保护好这个村庄
Colonel, this is an significant find. I need your men to secure this village.

226
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,200
我们根本就不该来
We are not even supposed to be here.

227
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,630
我的工作是确保任何有价值的东西不会落到敌人手中
Is my job to make sure that anything of value stays out of enemy hands.

228
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,720
下面到底有什么我们一点也不知道
We have no idea what could be down there.

229
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,220
单就图坦卡蒙的墓穴来讲
The content of Tutankhamun's tomb alone...

230
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,520
就价值6亿5千万英镑
...were valued at 650 million pounds sterling.

231
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
明白吗
Understand?

232
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,590
上校  恕我直言  派几个人守着
Colonel.. if I may. With a couple shake charges...

233
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,940
就可以立即关闭这个洞  哈尔西小姐改天可以再来
...we could just close this hole right up, and Miss Halsey can come back another day.

234
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,680
- 闭嘴  - 好吧
- Shut up. - Okay.

235
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,680
闭嘴

236
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,680
Shut up

237
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,990
给你们两小时  然后就撤退
You got two hours, then we're moving out.

238
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,160
你带着他一起下去
You are getting in the hole with him.

239
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
- 他  - 我
- Him? - Me?

240
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,040
没错
Yep.

241
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,400
长官
Sir.

242
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,770
带好装备下去  这是命令
You gear up, that's an order.

243
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,380
我在外面守着  长官
I'll be right here on the road Sarge.

244
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,730
维尔  你也进去
Get in the damn hole, Vail!

245
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,050
该死
Oh man!

246
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,510
我现在在一个类似于前室的地方
I am in a large antechamber of some kind.

247
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,910
在北墙上有铭文
There is an inscription on the northern wall.

248
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,530
拉之连祷
The litany of Ra.

249
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,480
搞笑呢吗
..kidding me?

250
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,470
是你的错  尼克  你的错
Your fault, Nick. Your fault.

251
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,250
看见任何宝物了吗  尼克  反正我是没看见
Do you see any treasure here, Nick? Because I don't.

252
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,840
知道我看见什么了吗  一堆我带不走的塑像
Do you know what I see? I see statues that I can't carry out.

253
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,200
- 小点声  - 你小点声
- Keep it down. - You keep it down.

254
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,690
你在做什么
What are you doing?

255
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,420
这里绝对是墓穴
It is definitely a tomb.

256
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,520
那是什么  水银吗
What is that? Mercury?

257
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,230
是啊
Yeah.

258
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,800
古埃及人认为水银可以削弱恶灵
The Ancient Egyptians believed that it weakened the evil spirits.

259
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,780
现在人可不这么无知了  这玩意能杀人
Well now we know better. This stuff will kill you.

260
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,430
是啊  在它把你搞疯之后
Yeah, after it makes you crazy.

261
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,580
房顶淌水银
There is mercury dripping from the ceiling...

262
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,610
到地下的洞里
...into holes in the ground.

263
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,510
可能连接到
Possibly to connect the..

264
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,730
这是水沟系统
It's a canal system...

265
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,580
一路引到
...leading all the way to...

266
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,390
开大灯
Get the lights!

267
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,740
天啊
Oh my God.

268
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,490
把包里的东西都拿出来
Get everything out of the bags.

269
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,670
我怎么说的来着
What did I tell you?

270
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,360
尼克  好多金子
That's a lot of gold, Nick.

271
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,710
我在一间靠近前室的人造洞穴里
I am in a large men-made cavern adjoining the antechamber.

272
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,140
从岩架下去有轮廓分明的阶梯
There are chiseled steps descending from the ledge.

273
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,390
在中心还有一条水沟
There is a canal at the center of them...

274
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:02,640
流入洞穴底部的一口仪式用水井  充满了水银
...that feeds a ritual well at the base, filled with mercury.

275
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,970
圣甲虫宝珠  带有圣甲虫标识的戒指
Beads of scarabs, scarab signal rings.

276
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,110
这位是来自底比斯庙的
This is a high priest of Ammon...

277
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,810
阿蒙大祭司
...from the temple of the Thebes.

278
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,830
在水井周围设立了障碍链
There is a ritual barrier chain that's around the well...

279
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,200
作为对入侵者的警告入侵者
...as a warning to intruders.

280
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,500
禁止入内
To keep people out.

281
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,620
没有任何关于某个人进入死后世界的描述
There isn't a single provision made for someone's journey into the underworld.

282
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,940
没有卡诺卜坛  沙伯替人偶
No Canopic jars, no Shabtis.

283
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,730
埋葬在这样的地方
To be buried in a place like this...

284
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,450
应该命运比死还惨
...would have been a fate worse than death.

285
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,000
尼克
Nick!

286
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,880
想都别想
Don't even think about it.

287
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,180
在水池周围有六位看守
There are six watchers around the well...

288
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,320
注视着池中心而不是池外
...facing inward instead of out.

289
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,640
不管这里有什么
Whatever is in there...

290
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,990
这些链条不是为了将它拉上来
...those chains aren't for bringing it up.

291
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,050
而是为了困住它
They are for holding it down.

292
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,320
这里不是墓穴
This is not a tomb.

293
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,450
是监狱
It's a prison.

294
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,910
利马2-6  收到请回复
Lima 2-6, come in.

295
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,910
收到  长官
Copy, sir.

296
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,250
全部撤离  未知飞机入侵
Get out now. We've got reports of boogeys inbound.

297
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,020
我们得走了
We gotta take off.

298
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,300
让格林威上校通知一下国防威胁降低局
Tell Greenway we have to notify D.T.R.A.

299
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,190
为什么
For what?

300
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,140
- 需要从开罗来的专家  - 开罗
- I need specialists from Cairo... - Cairo?

301
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,370
还要潜水服和防护服
...seaborn suits and shielding cuffs.

302
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,100
珍妮  我们没时间了  最好拿上东西赶紧走人
Jenny, we are out of time. You better grab what you can now!

303
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,330
看不到水池里有什么我是不会走的
I'm not leaving until I see what's in that pool.

304
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,200
不行  你必须走  我们马上就走
Oh you are leaving. We're leaving right now.

305
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,620
我大老远来可不能轻易放弃
I have not come this far just to leave without...

306
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,690
喂  注意点
Hey! Hey!

307
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,310
停火  维尔
Cease fire! Vail!

308
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,760
停止射击  停止射击
Cease fire! Cease fire!

309
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,310
它们只是蔽日蛛  都没有毒性
They are just camel spiders! They're not even poisonous!

310
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,120
我们能不能  快走
Can we please, leave?

311
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,120
- 你疯了吗  维尔  - 冷静一下
- Are you out of your mind, Vail? - Please!

312
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,360
你有什么毛病
What is wrong with you?

313
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
那玩意咬了我脖子
That thing bit my neck!

314
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,360
- 好  冷静  - 它咬了我
- Okay.. okay. - It bit me!

315
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,220
够了  我不管了
Enough of this! I don't care!

316
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,370
老子要走了  不管你们来不来  我都走
I'm leaving! With or without you! I'm leaving!

317
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,560
它咬了我  求你了  尼克
It bit me! Please, Nick!

318
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,270
我们就不能走吗
Can we please, leave?

319
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,510
你释放了我
YOU HAVE SET ME FREE.

320
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,100
我选中的男人
MY CHOSEN.

321
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,760
尼克
Nick!

322
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
尼克
Nick!

323
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,970
尼克
Nick!

324
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,910
让格林威派一队人把这东西吊出去
Tell Greenway he is gonna send a team to get this thing out of here...

325
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,680
否则他就得向上级解释为什么把我抛下了
...or he is gonna have to explain why he left me behind.

326
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,830
快去
Do it!

327
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,580
好
Okay.

328
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,090
棺椁已固定至牵引线
Climb by the man!

329
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
牵引线固定
Climb line is steady.

330
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,850
往九点钟方向一点
More towards your nine o'clock!

331
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,090
停在9米高
Holding at 30 feet.

332
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,550
再一点
A little more.

333
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,580
B点呼叫E点  我们监控到罕见的沙尘暴
Bishop to Echo. We have visual on a severe sandstorm...

334
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,000
朝西吹向E12区
...heading west to Echo 12.

335
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
喂
Hey!

336
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,990
喂
Hey!

337
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,920
等等  等等我  请小心点  这东西有五千年历史了
Wait.. wait.. please be careful. This is 5,000 years old.

338
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,690
还有60秒起飞  快行动
60 seconds! In the air! Let's go!

339
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,860
小心  请一定小心
Careful, careful.

340
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,250
快起飞
Get us off the ground now!

341
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,980
哈尔西  快坐下
Halsey, take a sit!

342
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,550
需要帮忙吗
Need some help?

343
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,620
不用
No.

344
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,610
- 对了  不客气  - 为什么这么说呢
- You are welcome by the way. - How's that?

345
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,360
毕竟我救了你的  不论是什么的东西
Because I saved your.. whatever it is.

346
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,920
本来好好地藏了五千年  直到你投了地狱火导弹在上面
That was safely hidden for 5,000 years before you dropped a hellfire missile on it.

347
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,090
要不是这样你可能永远都找不到
And you might have never found it otherwise.

348
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,500
再一次  不客气
Again.. you're welcome.

349
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,520
你知道那是什么吗
Do you have any idea what this is?

350
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,380
它的重要性
The significance of it?

351
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,220
在美索布达米亚的一具埃及石棺
An Egyptian sarcophagus in a tomb in Mesopotamia.

352
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,740
为什么你说只有十五秒
Why just say "15 seconds"?

353
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
十五秒什么
What of what?

354
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:19,040
你和格林威说我模仿了人类亲密动作的所有行为
You told Greenway that I can mimic all the qualities of human intimacy...

355
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,810
十五秒
...for 15 seconds.

356
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,020
至少  不止十五秒吧
I mean.. uh.. it was not 15 seconds.

357
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,320
不管持续了多久  那都不是认真的
Well, however long it lasted, it wasn't real.

358
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,800
我从没在感情上骗过你
I never lied to you about my feelings.

359
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,820
你偷走了我的地图
You stole from me.

360
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,000
但我真没撒谎
But I didn't lie.

361
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,030
除了你自己还在乎过别人吗
Do you ever think of anyone but yourself?

362
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,710
这具石棺有意义
This means something.

363
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,860
比你想象的意义更深远
Something bigger than you can imagine.

364
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,240
我毕生的心血
My life's work.

365
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,380
你还想从我手里偷走
And you were going to steal it.

366
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,120
你觉得这在黑市上值多少钱
How much do you think that's worth on the black market?

367
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,110
我是珍妮弗・哈尔西
This is Dr. Jennifer Halsey..

368
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,150
对一具埃及石棺进行初步分析
Conducting a preliminary analysis of an Egyptian sarcophagus...

369
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,900
此棺材发现于伊拉克北部的尼尼微省
...discovered in the Nineveh province, Northern Iraq.

370
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,430
象形文字显然是新王国时期的
The hieroglyphs are definitely New Kingdom.

371
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,080
看起来美尼帕特拉国王的妻子
It appears that the wife of King Menehptre...

372
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,810
难产而死
...died in childbirth...

373
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,950
留下王位唯一的继承人
...leaving a sole heir to the throne...

374
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,660
一位女孩
...a girl...

375
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,020
叫做安玛奈特
...called Ahmanet.

376
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,750
下士  你小子在他妈的干什么呢
Corporal, what in the living hell are you doing son?

377
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,980
维尔
Vail?

378
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,770
维尔下士
Corporal Vail?

379
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,040
该死
Dammit.

380
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,840
维尔下士  听到我说话了吗  我说你在
Corporal Vail, do you hear me talking to you? I said what are you..

381
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
维尔  冷
Vail, just...

382
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
维尔
Vail! Wow.. wow!

383
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,950
维尔
Vail!

384
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,070
天啊  维尔
Oh my God. Vail!

385
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,370
放下武器  快点
Drop the weapon! Drop it now!

386
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,170
放下
Now!

387
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,350
拜托  别冲动
Please.. please..

388
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,220
快放下
Drop it now!

389
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,690
- 放下枪  - 快

390
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,840
扔下武器  快  后退
Put down the weapon! Put it down.. Back off..

391
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,290
停手  别开枪  这是个密封飞机
Stop! Do not shoot! This is a pressurized aircraft!

392
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,460
尼克
Nick.

393
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,970
维尔
Vail.

394
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,650
- 维尔  放下刀  - 维尔

Ehy Vail! Stop! Stop! Vail.. Vail!

398
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,010
抱歉
I'm sorry.

399
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,810
飞机故障
Pan-pan-pan.

400
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,660
这里是编号4099
This is November 4-0-9-9.

401
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,020
美国C-130运输机

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,120
- 发生了什么  - 坐好系上安全带
- What's happening? - Take your sit and strap in.

403
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,260
- 英国大陆之上  - 英国

404
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,420
现在我也不知道发生了什么  坐好
Right now I don't know what's happening. Take your sit!

405
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,090
两只引擎都坏了
We lost thrust in both engines.

406
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,010
联系不上地面  降到3658米  距离爱丁堡机场280英里
No way to our contact. Dropping to 12,000, 280 on the EDI.

407
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,710
那到底是什么
What the hell is that?

408
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,350
往后走
Go! Go! Go!

409
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,530

00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,520
我不知道怎么用
I do not know how to do this!

412
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,640
珍妮  你可以的  相信自己
Jenny, you can do this! You can do this!

413
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,800
给我你的手
Give me your hand!

414
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,250
哈尔西小姐
Miss Halsey

415
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,210
哈尔西小姐  你是否已经准备好
Miss Halsey, do you think you're up to it.

416
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,230
你说什么意思
I'm sorry. What?

417
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,790
你得来辨识尸体
We need your help identifying the body.

418
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,910
无名氏
UNKNOWN

419
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:10,860
维尔
Vail!

420
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,720
兄弟
Hey buddy.

421
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,500
你吓屎我了
You scared the shit out of me.

422
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,910
我们得谈谈  尼克
We need to talk, Nick.

423
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,660
发生了什么
What's happening?

424
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,220
你应该知道的
You know what's happening.

425
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,440
我死了吗
Am I dead?

426
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,770
死
Dead?

427
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,870
不  但你会希望自己死了
No. But you are gonna wish you were.

428
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,630
这边请
Come on this way, please.

429
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,670
我的天  尼克
Oh my God! Nick.

430
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,050
珍
Jen.

431
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,270
发生了什么  我在哪
What's happening? Where am I?

432
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,940
这里谁管事
Who's in charge here?

433
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,310
呼叫基地  这里是搜寻一队
Base, this is search team one.

434
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,830
似乎飞机残骸一直延伸
Looks like the trail of wreckage...

435
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,860
到森林深处4公里左右
...it's spread across 2-2,5 half miles through the forest.

436
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,370
正向艾尔斯福德码头驶去  待命
Coming up on the Aylestord pier now. Standby.

437
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,450
码头一片狼藉  似乎是机翼的一部分  涡轮发动机
The pier is a wreck. It looks like a part of the wing. A turbine.

438
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,070
离主要失事地点距离相隔几英里  完毕
Miles away from the primary crash site. Over.

439
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,750
收到  搜寻一队  收到信息
Copy, search team one. Message received.

440
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,450

One body found. No obvious signs of life. Standby.

441
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,940
伤员证实已死亡

442
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,550
请求急救人员到场  完毕

443
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,530
收到  搜查一队

444
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,920
急救人员已上路  完毕
Ambulance staff now on route. Over.

445
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,560
什么  这是什么鬼
What.. what the hell...?

446
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,390
喂  你最好过来
Hey! You better come in to...

447
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,710
艾伦
Allen?

448
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,830
艾伦
Allen?

449
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
你还好吗
You alright?

450
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,810
艾伦
Allen!

451
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,970
天啊
Jesus!

452
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,950
觉醒吧
Rise.

453
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,580
一架美国军用飞机今晚坠毁在萨里郡
A US military plane crash landed in Surrey this evening...

454
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,690
刚好与韦弗利修道院擦身而过
...just missing Waverley Abbey.

455
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,460
你是怎么逃出飞机的
How did you get out of that plane?

456
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,060
身上一点伤痕都没有
There's not a single scratch on your body.

457
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,080
我哪知道
Yeah.

458
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,910
谢谢你
Thank you.

459
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,460
谢什么
For what?

460
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,350
救了我的命
You saved my life.

461
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,110
换你也会这么做的
You would have done the same for me.

462
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,410
尼克
Nick.

463
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:19,970
尼克
Nick.

464
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
听着  尼克
Listen, Nick.

465
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,080
有件事你应该知道
I think you should know something.

466
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,950
我和一群考古学家一起共事
You know I work with a group of archaeologists.

467
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,230
- 是的  - 因此
- Yeah. - Well...

468
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,930
我们建立了一个理论
...we developed this theory...

469
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,550
一位埃及公主被从历史中抹去了
...that an Egyptian princess had been erased from the history books...

470
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,530
人为抹去
...deliberately.

471
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,290
我们一直在寻找一个叫赛特的匕首的东西
We've been searching for something called "The dagger of Seth".

472
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,850
一把刀柄上有颗大宝石的仪式用刀
A ceremonial knife with a large jewel at the hilt.

473
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,580
赛特是埃及的死神
Seth is the Egyptian God of death.

474
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,690
传说刀石合一
And legend has it that the dagger and the stone, together...

475
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,490
能够赋予赛特形体
...had the power to give Seth physical form.

476
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,340
我确信它就藏在这里  欧洲的某处
I'm convinced it was hidden here, in Europe.

477
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,270
几世纪前被十字军偷走
Stolen by crusaders centuries ago.

478
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:08,600
我找到一张十字军骑士的手稿里面提到过这把匕首
I found reference to it in a manuscript written by a crusader knight...

479
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,500
手稿中暗示匕首被分为两半
that suggested the dagger was broken apart.

480
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,600
宝石与此骑士一同下葬
That the stone buried with this knight...

481
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,560
就在英国某处
...somewhere here in England.

482
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:23,080
一处我们最近在伦敦地下发现的  十字军墓穴里
A massive crusader tomb, was recently discovered under London.

483
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,940
相信那宝石就在那里的某处
We believe that the stone is in there somewhere.

484
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,610
那墓穴指引我们找到安玛奈特存在的证据
That tomb is what led us to Ahmanet.

485
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,060
她应该就是传说中的公主
I think she is the princess in the legend.

486
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,640
石棺上的象形文字说她曾弑父
The hieroglyphics said that she murdered her father.

487
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,240
- 弑父  - 以及她弟弟
- Murdered? - Along with his child.

488
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,690
她与死神达成了某种协议
She made some sort of pact with the God of death.

489
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,310
接着  我看到那些鸟儿
And then, when I saw those birds...

490
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,780
沙尘暴还是什么的之后  有大事要发生
...and that sandstorm... Whatever I mean something is happening.

491
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,040
而且我也不知为何你还活着
You are alive I do not know how.

492
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,000
你  我  走
You... I... Go...

493
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,230
抱歉  尼克  我们应该触怒了神灵
I'm sorry, Nick. I think we angered the Gods.

494
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,680
可以等我一下吗
Can you excuse me?

495
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,480
一会就回来
I'll be right back.

496
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,300
请表明身份
Identify, please.

497
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,750
我是珍妮弗  我找亨利
Jennifer. Get me Henry.

498
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,220
珍妮弗
Jennifer.

499
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:25,800
问题比我们想象的还要严重
This is a far more significant problem than we have ever imagined.

500
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,440
有大事要发生了  亨利  我担心他
Something is happening, Henry. I'm worried about him.

501
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,880
把那个军人带来伦敦  别和他再深入探讨了
Bring your soldier to London. Do not discuss anything further with him.

502
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,150
明白了吗
Understand?

503
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,730
你来这做什么
What are you doing here?

504
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,030
珍妮看起来挺漂亮
Jenny looks good.

505
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,140
- 这不是真的  - 真的很漂亮
- Ok this isn't happening. - I mean really great.

506
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,270
行了  快闭嘴
Ok. Really stop.

507
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,080
我一直觉得她能看上我
You know I always thought I had a chance with her.

508
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,070
- 什么  - 你为什么要插一脚
- What? - How do you squander that?

509
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,870
墓穴里有水银  蒸汽
There was mercury in that tomb. Vapors.

510
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,140
你是怎么搞砸的
How did you mess that up?

511
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,380
你只是我脑中的幻象
It's just in my head.

512
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,080
才不是
No it's not.

513
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,760
你开枪射了我
You shot me.

514
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,770
等等  等等  你
Wait. What.. wait wait wait you...

515
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,680
你
You...

516
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,300
你杀了格林威
...you stabbed Greenway.

517
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,060
- 我救了你  - 你杀了他
- I saved you. - You murdered him.

518
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,190
所以你就开枪打了我
And you shot me.

519
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,220
你想要杀我来着  你还要害珍妮
You tried to kill me. You even went after Jenny.

520
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,860
你开枪打了我  三次
You shot me. Three times.

521
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,380
没错
Yes.

522
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,390
三次啊  尼克
Three times, Nick.

523
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,030
第三次有点没必要了
The third one was unnecessary.

524
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,700
只是你吓到我了  我慌了
You freaked me out. I panicked.

525
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,990
我很抱歉  行吗
I'm sorry. Okay?

526
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,220
不行
Not okay.

527
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,300
看看我  看看我的脸
Look at me. Look at my face.

528
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,240
尼克  我被诅咒了  你和我都被诅咒了
I'm cursed Nick, and you are cursed.

529
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,460
只有一种办法打破诅咒
And there is only one way to break it.

530
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,270
完全照着她的旨意来
You're going to do exactly what she wants...

531
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,350
否则我们的下场会惨得多
...or this is gonna get a lot worse for both of us.

532
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,340
我被诅咒了是什么意思
What do you mean I'm cursed?

533
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,620
不好意思
Sorry.

534
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,630
就  让我待一会儿  谢谢
Just.. uh.. give me a minute. Thank you.

535
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,690
对了  你进了女厕所
You walked into the chicks bathroom by the way.

536
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,900
去你自己的厕所上去
Go to your own bathroom!

537
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,470
没错  这里是女厕所
Yes, it's the ladies room.

538
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,010
你说我被诅咒了是什么意思
What do you mean I'm cursed?

539
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,830
你以为自己是怎么在事故中幸存的
How do you think you survived the crash?

540
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,670
你是我选中的男人
"Setapai".

541
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,070
你知道这是什么意思
You know what it means.

542
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,570
她对你有安排  尼克
She's got plans for you, Nick.

543
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,230
安排
Plans?

544
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,190
你跑不了
You can't run away.

545
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,970
逃不掉的
You can't escape.

546
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,640
救救我
Help me!

547
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,460
救救我
Help me!

548
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,660
别站路中央  傻子
Get out of the road, wanker!

549
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,820
尼克
Nick!

550
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:42,120
你到底在做什么
What the hell are you doing?

551
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,530
你是对的
I think you were right.

552
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,120
- 我们触犯了神灵  - 等等  什么
- We angered the Gods. - Wait.. what?

553
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,710
我看到了她  石棺里女人
I saw her.. the chick in the box.

554
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,050
- 安玛奈特  - 对

555
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:53,470
- 尼克  - 他说我被诅咒了
- Nick... - He said I'm cursed.

556
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,700
- 谁说的  - 维尔
- Who said? - Vail.

557
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,010
- 维尔  - 我们找到的那个棺材
- Vail? - The coffin we found.

558
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,210
- 是石棺  - 管它呢
- Sarcophagus. - Whatever.

559
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,280
上面有字
There was writing on it.

560
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,250
是象形文字
Hieroglyphics.

561
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:02,750
珍妮  拜托  我现在没心思研究考古的行话
Jenny, respectfully, I'm not interested in archeological jargon right now.

562
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,280
我们从洞里拿出来的那个盒子  上面的字
The writing on the box that we took out of the hole.

563
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,330
是的  对不起
Yes, sorry.

564
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,640
那里面是什么诅咒  是的吧  是不是
There was something about a curse in there, was it there? Was it there?

565
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:12,470
尼克  你当时撞到脑袋了
Nick, you've had a concussion.

566
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,470
- 的确  - 还吸进了毒气
- Yes. - Toxic exposure.

567
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:17,860
那怎么解释我知道Setapai是吾之所选的意思
How does that explain that I know that "Setapai" means: "My Chosen".

568
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,670
- 古埃及文而已  - 古埃及文
- It's Ancient Egyptian. - Ancient Egyptian.

569
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:22,490
那我又是怎么懂古埃及文的
How do I know that?

570
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,620
你在中东呆了好些年
You've been in the middle east for years.

571
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,330
啥  才不是
What? No!

572
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,530
你原先听过  只是自己不记得了
You heard it.. you forgot it..

573
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,960
你怎么总不愿承认呢  我告诉你
Why are you backing off from this? I'm telling you.

574
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,640
她真的存在
She is real.

575
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,170
尼克
Nick.

576
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,440
尼克  怎么了
Nick.. what is it?

577
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,110
我想你才是对的
I think you're right.

578
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,670
我  这些都是我想象出来的
I.. This is all in my head.

579
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,280
你难道就不能找到那个盒子  看看里面
Can't you find the box, look inside

580
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,590
若是我看见里面有具3000年的人干的话
...and when I see a 3,000 years old prune in there...

581
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,290
- 尼克  - 再没什么诅咒了
- Nick. - ...no more curse.

582
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:58,500
别找什么石棺了  你得去看医生
You don't need a sarcophagus, you need a doctor.

583
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,980
我认识个人
I know someone.

584
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,600
伦敦的一个专家
A specialist in London.

585
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,190
别告诉我你也不想见识一下它
Don't tell me that you don't want to see it too.

586
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:07,000
这可是你毕生的心血  来吧  珍妮
Your life's work, come on Jenny.

587
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:10,120
我想我知道在哪
I think I know where it is.

588
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,470
这里是查理8-1号基地
Charlie 8-1 the base.

589
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:17,940
我们在坠机点  距韦弗利修道院北400米
We are at impact site, 400m north of Waverley Abbey.

590
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,240
消防员控制住火情

591
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:03,830
尼克
Nick.

592
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,620
尼克  你去哪
Nick! Where are you going?

593
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,760
坠机点不是这个方向  你是要去哪
The crash isn't up that way. Where are you going?

594
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,590
不
No.

595
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,130
就是这
We are in the right place.

596
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,430
尼克
Nick.

597
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:22,800
尼克
Nick!

598
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:24,930
我不知道我们来这干嘛
I do not know what we're doing here.

599
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,180
不是这里
This isn't the right place.

600
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,120
就是这
Yes it is.

601
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,980
不  不是的
No it isn't.

602
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,830
主坠机点是在那边那
The main crash site it's up that way...

603
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,230
我们发掘到的古董也在那边
...and so is my artifact.

604
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,680
我们该去那才对
And that's where we are going.

605
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:13,900
怎么回事
What the hell?

606
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:16,970
我怎么
How did I..?

607
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,440

621
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,300
别  别扔下我
No! No! No!

622
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,630
尼克  别这样
Ehy! Nick! No!

623
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,920
尼克
Nick!

624
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,720
你刚是想把我丢下吗
Were you just gonna leave me?

625
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,850
你看到了对吧  看到了吧
You saw that, right?

626
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:43,030
你想扔下我
You were gonna leave me!

627
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:44,780
- 你看到了  对吧  - 我又没瞎
- You saw it, right? - I can't unsee it!

628
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,470
咱们是要去哪
Where are we going?

629
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,910
离开这儿  前面有条高速路
Away from here. There's a highway up ahead.

630
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,680
- 你怎么知道  - 我就是知道
- How do you know? - I know.

631
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,190
我的天  你知道这是什么吗
Oh my God. Do you realize what this is?

632
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,500
是赛特之匕
It's the dagger of Seth.

633
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,540
她想拿这玩意直接捅穿我
She was gonna drive that thing right through me.

634
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,550
那块石头  不见了
The stone, it is missing.

635
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,630
的确  看样子她真的很生气

636
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,070
是真的
It's real.

637
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,700
这玩意怎么在石像里
How was in that statue?

638
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,990
那个石像是个圣物箱
That statue was a reliquary.

639
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,690
十字军用它们来藏圣物的
Crusaders have been using them to hide holy relics.

640
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,610
但她知道它在哪
But she knew it was there.

641
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,370
你是说  是她把飞机搞失事的吗  故意的吗
You are saying that she brought the plane down there? On purpose?

642
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,510
所以她才要引你去教堂
That's why she wanted you to come to the church.

643
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:27,720
她引我去教堂吗
She wanted me to go to the church?

644
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,710
是我说我要去教堂的
I told you that I wanted to go to church.

645
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,390
我告诉你说  我说  我想去看
I told you.. I said.. That I wanted to see...

646
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,130
- 我先看看那个女尸  - 看那个女尸
- I wanted to see her corpse. - See her corpse.

647
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:42,530
尼克  她在操纵你的思想
Nick she is in your head.

648
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,470
你说的什么话  这也  太荒谬了  我
What are you talking about? That.. that is ridiculous. Because I...

649
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,580
我又开回来了  开到她这儿了
I drove right back to her.

650
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,270
天啊她在操纵我的思想
Oh my God she is in my head.

651
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:08,200
快走  快走
Go go go go go!

652
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,100
把这玩意弄走
Get it off of me!

653
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,670
该死的
Son of a bitch!

654
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,680
踢到我了  踢到我的脸了
That's my face! That's my face!

655
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,040
对不起
Sorry!

656
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,440
尼克

好的
Alright.

663
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:56,010
搞死她  尼克
Get her, Nick!

664
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,600
揍她  狠狠揍她
Get her! Get her!

665
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:02,820
扁死她
Kick her ass!

666
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:23,230
第二阶段  快上
Phase two! Quick!

667
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,740
拉住她

你要带我去哪
Where are you taking me?

672
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:21,800
怎么回事
What's happening?

673
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,150
待着别动
Stay.

674
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,860
就当在自个家一样
Make yourself comfortable.

675
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,640
你谁啊
Who the hell are you?

676
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,490
我是谁
Who am I?

But you see, this file contains nothing of any real value to me.

694
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:37,000
恕我冒昧  莫顿先生  我想
I would like to, If I may, Mr. Morton...

695
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,790
跟你讲个故事
...to tell you a story.

696
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,110
是我一个病人的故事
A story about a patient of mine.

697
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,050
他是个一个有前途的人
A man of promise.

698
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:49,480
一个一直觉得自己完美无瑕的人
A man who believed he was beyond reproach...

699
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,720
直到他病倒了
...until he got ill.

700
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:56,110
起初只是有一点点小症状
The disease manifested itself in subtle ways at first.

701
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:58,670
然后越来越严重
And then it grew...

702
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,260
他难以压抑自己的欲望
...into an overwhelming desire...

703
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,260
难以熄灭心中的渴求
...an unquenchable thirst...

704
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,980
他想掀起混乱
...for chaos.

705
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,480
他想看别人痛苦
For the suffering of others.

706
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,930
他很幸运
He was quite fortunate.

707
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,820
他自己就是个医师
He himself was a physician.

708
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:39,630
如果说邪恶是一种病原体的话  这一点有待商榷
And if evil were a pathogen, to be reasoned...

709
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,510
那肯定会有治愈良方的
...then there must surely be a cure.

710
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:46,240
恕我冒昧  莫顿先生  我想
I would like to, If I may, Mr. Morton...

711
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,960
给你看点东西
...to show you something.

712
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,310
莫顿先生  欢迎光临Prodigium
Welcome to Prodigium, Mr. Morton.

713
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:22,660
取自拉丁文中的Monstrum Vel Prodigium
From the Latin: "Monstrum Vel Prodigium".

714
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,930
意思是  警惕异兽
"A warning of monsters".

715
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:27,980
抱歉这儿一团糟
Forgive the state of things.

716
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,290
我们没多少时间来准备宴请我们的宾客
We had very little time to prepare for our guest.

717
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:32,640
只能依靠珍妮弗提供给我们的信息行动
And only the information Jennifer provided to go on.

718
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,550
事实上  她是我们的人
In truth, she works for us.

719
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,450
这生意  确切来说也不能算是科学
It's not an exact science, this business.

720
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,920
这生意是
And the business being?

721
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:46,760
是犯罪  莫顿先生
Evil, Mr. Morton.

722
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:52,190
识别确定  制服目标  做完测试  然后销毁
Recognized, contained, examined, destroyed.

723
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:58,010
迄今为止  她是我们遇到的  最古老的生物
She is, by far, the most ancient we have ever encountered.

724
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,480
你们想对她做什么
What are you doing to her?

725
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,000
用水银对她进行防腐处理
Embalming her with mercury.

726
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,070
在零下38度时
At -38 degrees...

727
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,960
她血管里的水银便会凝固
...the mercury in her veins will solidify...

728
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,170
解剖起来就比较安全了
...and she should be safe for dissection then.

729
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:19,220
解剖吗  你说我们只是要研究她的
Dissection? You said that we'd study her.

730
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:21,290
没错  通过解剖
Yes, by dissection.

731
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,490
但她是之于我们不太了解的历史的活见证人
But she is a living witness to a history that we barely know.

732
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:25,780
她是个威胁  珍妮弗
She is a threat, Jennifer.

733
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,170
等一等  慢点  那我会怎么样
Hold on, hold on. So.. where does that leave me?

734
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:31,030
被诅咒  莫顿先生
Cursed, Mr. Morton.

735
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,400
这可不是普通的伤风感冒
This is not some common cold you have.

736
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:37,020
鸡汤和一晚好眠不会让你好起来
Some chicken soup and a good night sleep will not make it go away.

737
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,350
你是被选中
You have been selected...

738
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:42,030
承载终极魔王的躯体
...as the vessel for the ultimate evil.

739
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:44,980
而我们是唯一能够帮你的人
And we are the only ones who can rectify that.

740
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,450
汝命既定
YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR FATE.

741
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:55,050
诅书永存
THE CURSE WILL NEVER BE BROKEN.

742
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:01,410
前人既殁
MY CHOSEN ONE WAS MURDERED.

743
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:06,190
汝将替之
YOU WILL TAKE HIS PLACE.

744
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,560
若汝择之
BUT IF YOU CHOOSE HIM...

745
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:14,860
别去
No.

746
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:18,300
亦何杀之
WHY WERE YOU GOING TO KILL HIM?

747
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,520
非我本意
I WAS NOT GOING TO KILL HIM.

748
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,890
我本是要给他
I was going to give him...

749
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,290
永生
...eternal life.

750
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:34,500
让他成为神
Make it a living God.

751
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,540
你杀害了你父亲
You murdered your father.

752
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,770
我曾深爱我父亲
I loved my father...

753
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,130
全心全意
...with all my heart.

754
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:47,530
我只希望也得到他的爱
I only wanted his love in return.

755
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:49,280
你杀了他夫人
You killed his wife.

756
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,130
还有他们的孩子
Their child.

757
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,270
那已经是不同往昔了
They were different times.

758
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:13,090
觉醒之日即将来临
The day of the awakening will soon be upon us.

759
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:16,570
你会成为赛斯
You will become Seth.

760
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:21,520
世间一切都会臣服于你
The world will fall to your desire.

761
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:26,600
你将获得超越死亡的复生之力
You will have power of life over death.

762
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:31,450
还有我伴你左右
And you will have me.

763
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:34,590
我会成为你的王后
I will be your queen.

764
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:37,080
屈服吧
Just give in.

765
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,560
尼克
Nick.

766
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,240
尼克  醒醒
Nick, wake up.

767
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,990
醒醒
Wake up.

768
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,120
他们会杀了你
They will kill you...

769
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,100
像对待我之前所选之人一样
...just as they killed my chosen before you.

770
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,420
好痛苦
It burns.

771
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,250
什么
What?

772
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:10,020
好痛苦
It Burns!

773
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,730
别折磨她了
Stop it!

774
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:15,950
快点
Stop it!

775
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,560
她很痛苦
Stop!

776
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,030
停下来
Stop it!

777
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,180
别灌了
Stop!

778
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:24,520
真有趣
Fascinating.

779
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:39,720
我该怎么和你说呢
What was I supposed to tell you?

780
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,160
如果我说真有这个地方你会相信我吗
Would you even have believed me if I said that this place was real?

781
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,090
当亨利找上我
When Henry came to me...

782
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:50,070
因为共同利益我接受了这份工作
...I took the job because we had a common interest.

783
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:53,780
那你们在彼此利用
So you are using each other.

784
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:57,130
而现在  她在利用你
Now, she's using you.

785
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:05,740
听着
Look.

786
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,530
不管你会想什么
Despite what you might think...

787
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:10,600
不管我
...despite my...

788
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,610
多冷静
...my better judgment...

789
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,780
我都在乎你
...I care about you.

790
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,140
在你心里某个角落  努力抗争着的
Somewhere in there, fighting to get out...

791
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:22,930
是个好人
...is a good man.

792
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,870
这你可不知道
You don't know that.

793
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,560
我知道
I do.

794
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:33,070
怎么会
How?

795
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,510
你在飞机上救了我一命
You saved my life on that plane.

796
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:41,500
毫不犹豫就把唯一的降落伞给了我
You gave me the only parachute without hesitation.

797
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,880
我以为还有另一个的
I thought there was another one.

798
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,360
莫顿先生
Mr. Morton.

799
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,180
喝一杯吗
Drink?

800
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:26,480
我可能找到些线索
I think I found something.

801
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,400
如你所见
WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN...

802
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,730
你必须知道
WHAT YOU MUST KNOW...

803
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,610
我研究过上古之神的文字
I HAVE STUDIED THE WORD OF THE OLD GODS.

804
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:04,390
上古之神
The old Gods?

805
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:11,740
你们的语言简单至极
Your language is simple.

806
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,360
你真正想知道的
What you truly wish to know...

807
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:21,720
是什么凌驾于死亡面纱之上
...is what lies beyond the veil of death.

808
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:27,460
了解我的经历
To know what I have seen?

809
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,410
没错
Yes.

810
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:31,880
你会知道的
And you will...

811
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:37,770
当我杀死你那天
...when I kill you.

812
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:49,240
他们找到了宝石
They have found the stone.

813
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,760
你把我选中之人带来了这里
You brought my chosen here.

814
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:59,570
你以为他们现在会如何处置他呢
What do you think they will do with him now?

815
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,220
欢迎来到神与鬼怪
Welcome to a new world...

816
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:21,740
的新世界
...of Gods and monsters.

817
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:26,510
恶灵有很多称号  莫顿先生
Evil has many names, Mr. Morton.

818
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,060
拿赛斯来说
Take Seth, for example.

819
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:31,920
在埃及被称为死亡之神
Known to Egyptians as the God of death.

820
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:35,110
在旧约中有撒旦和路西法之说
In the Old Testament: Satan, Lucifer.

821
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,230
- 恶魔  - 正是
- The Devil. - Quite so.

822
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,990
没错  真坏  我得
Yeah. Bad.. bad.. gotta..

823
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:42,520
恶灵是徘徊在我们世界之外的影子
You see Evil is the shadow that exists just outside our world...

824
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:46,940
绞尽脑汁地想办法进入人间
...continuously searching for a way to come in...

825
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:50,980
只为拥有血肉之躯
...for a way to become flesh and blood.

826
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,190
要么  我们等待它成功那一天
Either.. we wait for that day to arrive...

827
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,680
或者我们主动出击
...or we can fight it on our own terms.

828
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:11,590
这就是为什么我遇见了你
Which brings me to you.

829
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,940
我吗  对了  很好  博士
Me? Yeah, great, yes.. doc.

830
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,640
你说过能解除我身负的诅咒  摆脱她的控制
You said that you could cure me of this curse. Get rid of it.

831
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:19,990
快开始吧  博士
So, let's do it doc.

832
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:21,880
你的计划是什么
What's your plan?

833
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,050
莫顿先生  这种事比较复杂
Mr. Morton, these things are complex.

834
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,610
是吗  我想也是
Yeah? I bet, I bet.

835
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:31,280
处理拯救人类的难题时
When one is dealing with the salvation of humanity...

836
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:34,690
必定带来一定的牺牲
...certain sacrifices must be made.

837
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,240
打扰了  先生
Excuse me, sir.

838
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,270
他们找到了
They found it.

839
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:42,390
找到什么  什么
What found.. what?

840
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,360
亨利
Henry.

841
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,090
你是要杀他吗
Are you planning on killing him?

842
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,170
杀他
Kill him?

843
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,620
- 珍妮弗  - 杀谁
- Jennifer... - Kill who?

844
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:53,460
莫顿先生是自己作死
Mr. Morton here essentially killed himself...

845
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:55,570
在他切断了束缚了安玛奈特
...when he severed the barrier chain...

846
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:58,170
法力5000年的隔离链之后
...that had kept Ahmanet power imprisoned for 5,000 years.

847
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,440
他被她选为完美候选人
He was chosen as her ideal candidate.

848
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:09,090
一个体格健全  天性狡猾的小偷
A thief, physically capable, compulsively devious...

849
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:10,680
并早已丧失了灵魂
...and utterly devoid of soul.

850
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,080
- 什么  - 什么
- What? - What?

851
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,320
这太疯狂了
That's insane.

852
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:16,020
你难道想把宝石与匕首合体刺死他吗
Do you want to put the stone in the dagger and stab him with it?

853
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:18,710
那匕首会让赛斯进入他的身体
The dagger will allow Seth to enter his body.

854
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:21,200
接着我们就能杀掉他
And then we obliterate it.

855
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:22,420
慢着  慢着
Wait, wait, wait.

856
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:25,410
你想故意用那匕首刺我吗
Do you want to stab me with that thing? Intentionally?

857
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,890
恰恰就是埃及人那是该做的
Precisely what the Egyptians should have done.

858
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,410
他们打断了进行中的仪式
You see, they interrupted a ritual in process...

859
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:36,410
而这样的错误
...and that is mistake we cannot...

860
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,440
是我们不能够再次承受的
...afford to repeat.

861
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,170
- 计划是什么  - 亨利
- That's the plan? - Henry...

862
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,580
你不能真这么做
...you can't possibly do this.

863
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,610
这就是你的计划吗
That's your plan?

864
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,260
多米诺骨牌已经开始倒下
The dominoes are already falling.

865
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,760
我们没有时间了
We haven't much time.

866
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,490
不幸的是  我们必须冒这个险
Unfortunately, it is a risk we must take.

867
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,230
那真是你的计划吗
That's really your plan?

868
01:11:56,470 --> 01:12:00,890
你听安玛奈特说了  你的诅咒无法打破
You heard Ahmanet. Your curse cannot be broken.

869
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:07,140
真心感到抱歉  莫顿先生  不论我做什么  你都死路一条
I am truly sorry, Mr. Morton. No matter what I do, you are going to die.

870
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:11,430
没错  恶灵是一种病症
Yes, evil is a disease.

871
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:13,960
一种不断蔓延的致命感染病
A pestilent pustulant infection...

872
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:17,050
慢慢侵蚀着我们的灵魂
...borrowing its way into our souls.

873
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:19,280
世界需要一剂解药
The world needs a cure.

874
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,680
你可以成为那解药
You can be that cure.

875
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:21,680
停
Stop.

876
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,270
牺牲小我成全大我
A sacrifice for the greater good!

877
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:26,030
这我一点也不感兴趣
I'm not interested in that at all.

878
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:26,810
这样
Okay.

879
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,110
- 别拿  - 把注射器给我
- Don't! - Give me the injector.

880
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,540
不如重新冷静一下
We are just gonna take a minute...

881
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,460
想一个新计划
...and we are all gonna come up with a new plan.

882
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,190
我们得走了
We have to go.

883
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,370
你不知道你这是在干什么
You don't know what you are doing.

884
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:35,870
真的吗  我知道的清清楚楚
Really? I know exactly what I'm doing.

885
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:37,490
噢  我亲爱的亨利・杰基尔
Oh my dear Henry Jekyll...

886
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,490
要说我在谁脸上见到了撒旦的印记
...if ever I've seen Satan signature upon a face...

887
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:43,010
那必定是你的新朋友脸上
...is on that of your new friend.

888
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:45,670
嘿   拿去吧
Hey, hey hey! Take it!

889
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:47,010
快走
Now!

890
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,780
- 快跑  莫顿先生  - 什么
- Run, Mr. Morton. - What?

891
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,490
快跑
Run!

892
01:12:58,510 --> 01:12:59,650
尼克  打开门
Nick! Open the door!

893
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:00,850
你不会想开门的
You don't want that.

894
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,750
别去  珍妮
Stop, Jenny!

895
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:05,080
回来
Stop!

896
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:29,870
我出不去  尼古拉斯  他们从不让我出去
They won't let me out, Nicholas. They never do.

897
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:39,470
发生了什么  你把水银关掉了吗
Woah woah what's happening? Did you just shut down the mercury?

898
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:40,770
皮特
Pete?

899
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:55,270
你比我年轻
You are a younger man...

900
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:57,880
但你必须学会警惕我这样的人
...but you must learn to be wary of a man like me.

901
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,860
是亨利想要杀你  不是我
It's not me that wants to kill you, it's Henry.

902
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,680
我反而更想和你合作
I have something more collaborative in mind.

903
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,960
和我合伙
I'm offering you a partnership.

904
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:41,630
你是恶灵化身  而我是你的好朋友埃迪・海德
You, evil incarnate. Me, your good friend, Eddie Hyde.

905
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,840
考虑一下
Think about it.

906
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:44,650
珍妮
Jenny!

907
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:47,430
过来
Come on.

908
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:10,610
珍妮  别去
Jenny, stop!

909
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,920
来啊  孩子  好好考虑
Come on, son. Think about it.

910
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:20,270
我集混沌  毁灭于一身
I am chaos, destruction.

911
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,840
女生们会爱死我们的
The ladies will love us.

912
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:24,470
过来
Come here.

913
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:30,760
我确实很享受你痛苦样子
I do enjoy the garments of pain.

914
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:48,210
干的好  莫顿先生  干的好
Well done, Mr. Morton. Well done.

915
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,120
快  我们必须摧毁这个宝石
Come on. We have to destroy the stone.

916
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:08,410
什么
What?

917
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:09,450
没有宝石  就没法进行仪式了
No stone, no ritual.

918
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,680
没有仪式
No ritual...

919
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,230
- 就没有诅咒  - 没错  我知道它在哪里
- ...No curse. - Yes. I know where it is.

920
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,340
- 等等  出去是哪条路  - 我不知道
- Wait, wait, which way out? - I don't know.

921
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,240
死亡之神
GOD OF DEATH...

922
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:21,420
将吾选之人带上前来
BRING FORTH MY CHOSEN...

923
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:27,160
召唤埃及之沙
I SUMMON THE SANDS OF EGYPT...

924
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,750
接受吾等
TAKE ME IN!

925
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,770
将他带来
DELIVER HIM TO ME!

926
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,050
你好
Hello?

927
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,470
她逃脱了  匕首在她身上
She's out! She has the dagger.

928
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:12,310
她应该是去找你了  我们也路上了
We thinks she is coming to you, so are we.

929
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:15,060
把门锁上保护好宝石
Lock your doors and secure that stone.

930
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:22,890
尼克
Nick!

931
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,270
尼克  我们走
Nick, let's go!

932
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,020
我知道宝石在哪里了
I know where the stone is!

933
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:27,200
快走
Let's go!

934
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,700
刚刚好险
Wow, that was intense!

935
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:51,290
跟我走
Okay, follow me.

936
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:56,670
我们在去十字军墓室的路上
We are headed to the crusader burial chamber.

937
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,050
我们从西北贸易通道进去  完毕
We'll make our entry through the northwest trade tunnels, over.

938
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:13,410
就看现在了  尼克
This is the moment, Nick.

939
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:15,080
光辉的时刻
This is the moment!

940
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:16,620
你说他妈没错
Yes, you are damn right.

941
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:19,480
我会拿走宝石  把你交给安玛奈特
I'm gonna taking that stone, Deliver you to Ahmanet...

942
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,820
我的任务就完成了
...and then my work here is done.

943
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,680
什么
What?

944
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,200
尼克
Nick?

945
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,400
珍妮
Jenny?

946
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,320
兄弟
Hey, buddy.

947
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:37,160
安玛奈特是不会让她活着的
Ahmanet is never going to let her live.

948
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:39,190
你救不了她
You can't save her.

949
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,780
复活吧  我的勇士们  为我效忠
ARISE, MY WARRIORS, AND SERVE ME.

950
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,630
不
No! Oh no!

951
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,250
尼克
Nick?

952
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:35,350
尼克
Nick?

953
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:37,760
尼克
Nick?

954
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:18,060
你不该来这里的
You shouldn't be here.

955
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:19,230
我跟着你来的
I followed you!

956
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:22,910
快走
Go go go!

957
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,120
还好吗
We are okay?

958
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:00,630
- 我们在哪  - 不知道
- Where are we? - I don't know.

959
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:04,710
你还好吧
Are you okay?

960
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,710
- 我好害怕  - 看着我
- I'm scared. - Just look at me.

961
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,570
我们会解决这一切的
We are gonna figure this out.

962
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,700
别放弃  拜托
Just, I need you to just stay with me, please.

963
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:13,870
我们会解决这一切的  只要相信我
We are gonna figure this out.. I need you to just stay with me.

964
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,030
别放弃  我们会想出办法的
Just stay with me. We'll think of something.

965
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,380
不行  珍妮
No! Jenny!

966
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,280
珍妮  不要
Jenny! No!

967
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:08,670
别
No!

968
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,380
放手
Let go!

969
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,030
珍妮
Jenny!

970
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:22,850
不
No!

971
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:48,030
不要自责
Don't blame yourself.

972
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,810
这是她命中一劫
She was always doomed.

973
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:12,840
还有比死亡更可怕的命运
There are worse fates than death.

974
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,000
来我身边
Come to me.

975
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:51,930
心痛
It hurts.

976
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:53,870
我懂
I know.

977
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,900
让我消除你的痛苦
Let me take pain away.

978
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:25,100
屈服于我
Give in to me.

979
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:00,960
屈服吧
Give in.

980
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,790
屈服
Give in.

981
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,320
当一切结束
When it's over...

982
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,750
你会感谢我的
...you will thank me.

983
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:13,620
我保证
I promise.

984
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:21,080
抱歉了
I'm sorry.

985
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:25,050
我们之间是永远不可能的
We are just never gonna happen.

986
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,160
而且不是我的问题
And it's not me.

987
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,120
是你
It's you.

988
01:29:53,530 --> 01:29:55,210
贼
Thief.

989
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:06,400
等等
Wait!

990
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:09,330
把宝石毁了
Destroy the stone...

991
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:12,440
一切都会消失
...and all is lost.

992
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:17,810
你能变成神
You will be a living God.

993
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:25,060
你会有起死回生的能力
You will have power of life over death.

994
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:32,430
屈服吧
Give it to me...

995
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:35,890
吾选之人
...my chosen.

996
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:43,110
屈服吧
Give it to me...

997
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,050
亲爱的
...my love.

998
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:40,110
在你内心的深处
Somewhere in there...

999
01:32:40,490 --> 01:32:42,440
我知道你是个好人
...I know you're a good man.

1000
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:55,460
这个世界需要解药
The world needs a cure.

1001
01:32:55,690 --> 01:32:57,160
你可以变成解药
You can be that cure.

1002
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,130
为伟大事业的牺牲
A sacrifice for the greater good!

1003
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:07,680
珍妮
Jenny.

1004
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,400
珍妮
Jenny.

1005
01:34:10,290 --> 01:34:11,460
醒醒
Wake up.

1006
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,970
醒醒
Wake up.

1007
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:19,340
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1008
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:21,320
我很抱歉  珍妮
I'm sorry, Jenny.

1009
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:25,780
珍妮
Jenny.

1010
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:31,630
珍妮  拜托快醒醒
Jenny, please wake up.

1011
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:35,100
真对不起
I'm sorry.

1012
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,500
我不知道自己在干嘛
I do not know what I'm doing.

1013
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:38,700
醒醒吧
Please wake up.

1014
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,200
珍妮
Jenny.

1015
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:45,980
醒醒
Wake up, please.

1016
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:52,600
珍妮  醒醒啊
Jenny, just wake up!

1017
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:09,670
尼克
Nick?

1018
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:13,800
尼克
Nick!

1019
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,520
尼克
Nick.

1020
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:55,230
尼克
Nick?

1021
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:56,620
别过来
Stop!

1022
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,990
别过来  拜托
Stop. Please.

1023
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:04,510
我不知道自己是谁
I don't know what I am.

1024
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:08,530
我不想伤害你  珍妮
I don't want to hurt you, Jenny.

1025
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:09,780
你还活着
You are alive.

1026
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:11,890
你还活着
You are alive.

1027
01:36:13,330 --> 01:36:15,340
看到你还活着我太高兴了
I'm so glad you're alive.

1028
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:18,080
尼克
Oh Nick.

1029
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:22,340
你这样做是为了我吗
You did this for me?

1030
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:24,990
嗯
Yes.

1031
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:28,640
我犯了太多
I have made so many...

1032
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:30,500
太多错误了
...many mistakes.

1033
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:34,110
这次不会了
But not this time.

1034
01:36:35,190 --> 01:36:36,780
尤其是你
Not you.

1035
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:40,910
我不想伤害你
I don't want to hurt you.

1036
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,160
我从未想过要伤害你
I never wanted to hurt you.

1037
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:46,830
你不会的
You won't.

1038
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,490
我们没有想到这会发生吧
We didn't see this coming, did we?

1039
01:37:00,330 --> 01:37:02,030
他们快来了
They are coming for me.

1040
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:07,140
真希望我们有更多时间
I wish we had more time.

1041
01:37:09,330 --> 01:37:10,800
我会找到你的
I'll find you.

1042
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,780
再见  珍妮
Goodbye, Jenny.

1043
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:50,480
你对尼克的看法是错的
You were wrong about Nick.

1044
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:53,850
他牺牲他的命来救我
He gave his life to save me.

1045
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:57,190
把我救回来
To bring me back.

1046
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:02,410
的确  詹妮弗
Yes, Jennifer.

1047
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,930
他找到了赎罪的方式
He found his redemption.

1048
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:07,860
但代价很大
But at great cost.

1049
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:11,290
他现在是个怪物
He is a monster now.

1050
01:38:12,410 --> 01:38:14,650
他也依旧是个人
He is also still a man.

1051
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,790
一个好人
A good man.

1052
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:19,000
也许
Perhaps.

1053
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:22,340
他才刚刚获得力量
Yet it has only begun to discover his power.

1054
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,990
现在下定论还太早了
And we cannot know which side will win out.

1055
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:29,820
黑暗和光明
Between Darkness and light...

1056
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:32,530
善良和邪恶之间谁输谁赢
...good or evil.

1057
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:34,620
尼克
Hey, Nick.

1058
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:35,820
尼克
Nick.

1059
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,250
来到这里我真的很高兴
I'm really glad to be here.

1060
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:43,200
谢谢你复活我还有这一切  尼克
I mean, thank you for bringing me back to life and everything, Nick...

1061
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:45,430
但我们来这里干嘛
...but what are we even doing here?

1062
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:47,710
何去何从
Where are we going?

1063
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,510
拜托  朋友
Come on, my friend.

1064
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:52,960
你冒险的精神去哪里了
Where is your sense of adventure?

1065
01:38:57,820 --> 01:38:58,990
该死
Oh No.

1066
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:02,190
无论他身上还剩下多少人性
Whatever human part of him remains...

1067
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:04,680
都会翻遍这个世界
...will search the world over...

1068
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,080
来找一个打破诅咒的方法
...for a way to break the curse.

1069
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,230
找到解药
To find the cure.

1070
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,510
但邪恶从不会停止
Yet evil never rests.

1071
01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:14,890
而人会一如既往
And you will call to them...

1072
01:39:15,810 --> 01:39:17,550
被它们吸引
...always.

1073
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:21,500
亨利  他用了自己的力量来阻止安玛奈特
Henry, he used his power to stop Ahmanet.

1074
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:25,890
你比任何都懂他能成为我们最强大的同盟
You know more than anyone he could be our greatest ally.

1075
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:28,780
也许吧
Perhaps.

1076
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:32,050
有时候确实需要
Sometimes it does take a monster...

1077
01:39:32,330 --> 01:39:34,170
以恶制恶
...to fight a monster.
