 You understand Tibetan? My father's a Tibetan.

58
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:12,936

Yes, he's been there for three years. He keeps the poachers away.

118

脱裤子,过河

All of you.

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,909
局长,没皮子没枪
Captain, they don't have pelts or guns.

157
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:41,894
趴下
Down on the ground.

158
00:28:50,422 --> 00:28:51,738
伤在哪儿?
Where's he injured?

159
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:53,114
他的腿
His leg.

160
00:29:01,058 --> 00:29:02,552
没救了
There's no hope.

161
00:29:04,353 --> 00:29:06,049
打在动脉上
It's the artery.

162
00:29:10,108 --> 00:29:12,326
我不要死!
I don't want to die.

163
00:29:12,944 --> 00:29:14,332
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

164
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:16,455
马卢
Ma Rui.

165
00:29:17,783 --> 00:29:19,277
哪里来的?
Where are you from?

166
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:23,295
华隆
Hualong.

167
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:25,552
多大啦?
How old are you?

168
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:27,883
二一
Twenty.

169
00:29:30,712 --> 00:29:32,930
你打过羊子吧?
Have you ever killed any antelopes?

170
00:29:37,803 --> 00:29:39,879
帮帮我
Please help me.

171
00:29:45,894 --> 00:29:50,165
(藏族祈祷)
(Tibetan prayer)

172
00:30:01,994 --> 00:30:03,832
带他们过河吧
Take them across the river.

173
00:31:11,563 --> 00:31:15,204
快,蹲下!
Hurry. Kneel down!

174
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:40,175
马哲立,你这次怎么说?
Ma Zhanlin, do you have anything to say this time?

175
00:31:40,175 --> 00:31:43,553
再给我一件大衣,我冷得受不了
Let me have another coat. I'm freezing cold.

176
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:44,977
你们家老板呢?
Where's your boss?

177
00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:47,860
我们刚拔了皮子  你给我老实讲
 We just skin them. Don't lie.

178
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,452
我就是这样
That's all I do.

179
00:31:49,518 --> 00:31:52,091
别耍花招  我不知道
 Tell us the truth. I don't know anything.

180
00:31:53,772 --> 00:31:55,539
你是枪手?  不是
 Are you the gunman? No.

181
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:57,238
你是枪手?  我不是枪手
 You're the gunman? No, I'm not.

182
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:59,014
干啥的?  我是司机
 Then what do you do? I'm the driver.

183
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:01,210
谁是枪手?  我不知道
 Who's the gunman? I don't know.

184
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,261
谁知道?  我儿子不是枪手
 Who knows? My son is not the gunman.

185
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:05,084
谁是枪手?  我也不知道
 Who is the gunman? I really don't know.

186
00:32:05,117 --> 00:32:06,184
谁知道?
Who knows?

187
00:32:06,243 --> 00:32:09,454
他知道,他请我们来的  马哲立,别胡说!
 He knew. He hired us. Ma Zhanlin, cut the crap!

188
00:32:09,454 --> 00:32:11,293
我是这班车司机
I'm just a driver.

189
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,768
你是枪手?  不是枪手,我是这班车司机
 Are you the gunman? No, I'm the driver.

190
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:33,312
那你老实说,谁是枪手  我不知道,他们从没跟我讲
 Then tell us who the gunman is. I don't know. They're lying.

191
00:32:33,312 --> 00:32:36,231
我没有办法说  别人说你知道,你知不知道
 I really don't know. They say you're in charge.

192
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:39,109
我不知道,他们出卖我的嘛
They're lying to save themselves.

193
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:41,434
你是司机,那你为啥不走?
Why are you still here if you're the driver?

194
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:46,036
车坏掉,我没办法修嘛
The truck broke down. I couldn't fix it.

195
00:32:46,283 --> 00:32:49,286
他们看不见你了,说吧
They can't see you now. Talk.

196
00:32:49,286 --> 00:32:51,611
看不见也没有办法呀
I really don't know anything.

197
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:55,142
这是你的最后机会  真的没办法嘛
 This is your last chance. I really can't help.

198
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,844
说!  我什么都不知道
 Talk! I don't know anything.

199
00:32:58,879 --> 00:33:01,999
说!  我真的不知道,我是司机嘛
 Talk! I know nothing. I just drive the truck.

200
00:33:03,216 --> 00:33:05,957
我不知道,真的不知道  说!
 I don't know. I really don't. Talk to us!

201
00:33:09,598 --> 00:33:11,851
我什么都不知道
I don't know anything.

202
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,819
说
Talk.

203
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:17,606
我真的不知道  说不说
 I know nothing. Talk to us.

204
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:22,894
放我走  说不说
 Let me go. Talk to us.

205
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:25,210
再不说就打死你!
Talk now or I'll shoot you!

206
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,778
我真的不知道
I don't know anything.

207
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:32,879
再不说就打死你!
Talk now or I'll shoot you!

208
00:33:34,373 --> 00:33:38,572
好,不要打死我,我说我说
All right, I'll tell you. Don't kill me.

209
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:03,263
皮子在这里
The pelts are here.

210
00:34:03,402 --> 00:34:04,611
挖
Dig.

211
00:34:27,342 --> 00:34:30,462
都在这里,底下还有
They're all here. There are more underneath.

212
00:34:55,537 --> 00:34:57,790
有几张皮子?
How many do we have?

213
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:01,235
五百四十七张,大多数是母羊  现在是交配季节
 547, mostly female. It's the breeding season.

214
00:35:02,627 --> 00:35:03,980
真可惜
What a shame.

215
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:17,504
枪手跑了
The gunman got away.

216
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:20,104
刚才抓的人呢?
What about the men you captured?

217
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:22,440
这些都是小口径
They were from small caliber rifles.

218
00:35:23,106 --> 00:35:25,253
这些羊子都是冲锋枪打的
The real gunmen use machine guns.

219
00:35:28,487 --> 00:35:30,634
我追了他们好多年
I've been chasing them for years.

220
00:35:59,142 --> 00:36:00,731
给我根烟好吗?
Can I have one?

221
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:04,447
我也好几天没抽烟了
I haven't smoked for several days, too.

222
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:06,699
谢谢
Thanks.

223
00:36:07,025 --> 00:36:09,730
大爷,您干什么的?
What do you do?

224
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:16,021
我剥皮子的
I skin the animals.

225
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:17,665
剥一张皮子给您多少钱?
How much do they pay you?

226
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:19,612
五块钱
Five Yuan for each pelt.

227
00:36:21,832 --> 00:36:25,794
我在格尔木是剥皮子最快、最便宜的人
I'm the fastest skinner in Ge'ermu.

228
00:36:25,794 --> 00:36:27,383
全家都在这里
All my children are here, too.

229
00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:30,966
他是老大,他是老二,这是老么
He's my eldest, here's the middle one, and the youngest.

230
00:36:30,966 --> 00:36:33,042
他们都在剥皮子
They're all skinners.

231
00:36:33,343 --> 00:36:35,668
我以前是放羊的
In the past, I was a shepherd.

232
00:36:36,596 --> 00:36:41,318
放羊、放牛、放骆驼
I herded sheep, cattle, and camels.

233
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:44,638
现在这个村变荒原
Now the grasslands have turned into desert.

234
00:36:44,646 --> 00:36:47,482
牛和羊死的死了,卖的卖了
The sheep and cattle all gone dead or sold off.

235
00:36:47,482 --> 00:36:50,922
人也没得吃的,人也活不下去
It's tough to survive here.

236
00:36:55,073 --> 00:36:58,549
我要上一号(指厕所)  我也是
 I need to pee. Me, too.

237
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:00,991
好,不要叫了
All right, stop yelling.

238
00:37:07,169 --> 00:37:09,565
葛玉,把篮子给我
Gayu, hand me the bucket.

239
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:25,807
我要撒尿  等一下
 I want to pee. Wait your turn.

240
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:51,016
枪手往北面走,他们肯定要过这条河
The gunmen had to cross this river, if they're heading north.

241
00:37:56,426 --> 00:37:57,636
可以过!
It's crossable!

242
00:38:42,931 --> 00:38:45,529
1、2、3!
One, two, three!

243
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:33,710
起来帮忙
Get up and help.

244
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,557
谁要喝一杯?
Who wants a drink?

245
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:46,568
第九天
DAY 9

246
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:14,742
绳子
Rope.

247
00:41:22,924 --> 00:41:24,692
一人半个
Everyone gets a half.

248
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:38,803
多给点吧?我好几天没吃东西了
I want more. I haven't eaten anything in days.

249
00:41:38,815 --> 00:41:42,943
我告诉你,没你吃的 是我们省下来的,知道不知道
We are sharing our food with you. That's all you get.

250
00:41:53,872 --> 00:41:55,366
谢谢你啊
Thank you.

251
00:41:55,707 --> 00:42:01,923
像流动的水
Like flowing water

252
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:10,847
哦,亲爱的妈
Oh, dear mother

253
00:42:10,847 --> 00:42:13,475
不管我去多远
No matter how far I travel

254
00:42:13,475 --> 00:42:19,348
我会回来 不管我去多远
I shall return no matter how far I travel

255
00:42:19,356 --> 00:42:23,860
美丽的白云 请帮我传信
Clouds of brilliant white please deliver my message

256
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,742
我想家
I long for home

257
00:42:28,156 --> 00:42:32,463
我在心中为你祈祷
I pray for you in my heart

258
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,059
进去
Get inside.

259
00:42:57,644 --> 00:42:59,412
转过来
Turn around.

260
00:43:12,993 --> 00:43:14,167
没睡啊?
Can't sleep?

261
00:43:14,953 --> 00:43:17,943
这一区不舒服,在车外站站就行
The air's thin up here. It's better outside the car.

262
00:43:18,623 --> 00:43:21,328
又流鼻血了  没事
 Your nose is bleeding again. It's all right.

263
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,741
真漂亮  就是
 It's beautiful. It is.

264
00:43:27,924 --> 00:43:31,329
说老实话,每次巡山到最后 发疯地想回去
I get homesick every time I go out on patrol.

265
00:43:31,887 --> 00:43:34,592
见到公路上的灯就像见到家里
Even the lights on the highway remind me of home.

266
00:43:34,598 --> 00:43:37,373
可是回去两、三天 又想到可可西里
But when I'm home I start thinking of Kekexili.

267
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:40,651
你觉得可可西里是什么意思?
Do you know what Kekexili means in Tibetan?

268
00:43:40,812 --> 00:43:44,632
可可西里在我们藏语中是 “美丽的青山、美丽的少女”
It means "Beautiful mountains and girls."

269
00:43:44,816 --> 00:43:46,963
就是,在可可西里...
That isn't it. In Kekexili...

270
00:43:47,152 --> 00:43:49,513
你踩下的每个脚印...
each step may be the first human footprint...

271
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:52,791
有可能是地球诞生以来 人类留下的第一个脚印
ever made on that spot since the world began.

272
00:43:54,326 --> 00:43:56,508
这句话不是我说的
Those aren't my words.

273
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,289
两年前,从北京来的一个地质学家
Two years ago, a geologist came from Beijing.

274
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:04,687
我送他进可可西里,是他跟我讲的
I took him to Kekexili and he said that to me.

275
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:09,664
后来那个地质学家在可可西里失踪了
Later the geologist went missing.

276
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:11,901
到现在都没有找到
No one has seen him since.

277
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:16,454
这里到处都是吃人的流沙
There's a lot of quicksand around here.

278
00:44:26,108 --> 00:44:28,017
你白痴!
You idiot!

279
00:44:28,443 --> 00:44:33,343
盗猎者呢?
Where are the poachers?

280
00:44:33,657 --> 00:44:35,246
他们人呢?
Where are they?

281
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:39,176
马哲立带他三个儿子跑了  啥时候睡着的?
 Ma Zhanlin escaped with his sons. When did you fall asleep?

282
00:44:39,204 --> 00:44:40,936
大概五点多钟
Around 5:00 a.m.

283
00:44:40,956 --> 00:44:43,245
队长!
Captain!

284
00:44:44,376 --> 00:44:46,072
滚开!
Let go of me!

286
00:45:10,485 --> 00:45:12,952
站住!
Stop!

287
00:45:13,864 --> 00:45:17,754
站住!
Stop!

288
00:45:21,246 --> 00:45:24,236
站住!听到了没?
Stop! Did you hear me?

289
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,549

00:45:46,438 --> 00:45:48,205
看着他!

291
00:45:49,232 --> 00:45:50,929
起来!
Get up!

292
00:45:52,694 --> 00:45:53,939
钥匙呢?
Where's the key?

293
00:45:54,029 --> 00:45:55,761
我没带
I don't have it.

294
00:46:02,621 --> 00:46:03,759
我确实没带
I really don't have it.

295
00:46:37,322 --> 00:46:38,496
这是什么?
What's this?

296
00:47:26,872 --> 00:47:28,948
他怎么啦?
What's wrong?

297
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:31,676
肺气肿
Pulmonary edema.

298
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:34,008
水?
Water?

299
00:47:34,087 --> 00:47:36,032
没水了
There isn't any.

300
00:47:37,382 --> 00:47:38,663
让我试一下呗
I can help.

301
00:47:41,345 --> 00:47:45,199
就让他试一下吧 他过去在格尔木当过兽医
Let him try, he was a vet in Ge'ermu.

302
00:48:02,074 --> 00:48:04,126
捏住他的手臂
Hold his arm.

303
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:57,257
刘栋,带大瓦回去看医生
Liu Dong, you take Dawa back to see the doctor.

304
00:48:58,046 --> 00:48:59,576
平丘,你也该回去
Ping Cuo, you should go back, too.

305
00:48:59,631 --> 00:49:02,884
我的肩伤没那么糟
My shoulder wound isn't that bad.

306
00:49:02,884 --> 00:49:05,031
我可以帮忙看犯人
I can help watch the prisoners.

307
00:49:05,053 --> 00:49:07,034
好
All right.

308
00:49:13,437 --> 00:49:17,541
我们要钱看医生
We need money for the doctor.

309
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:22,565
拿钱
Give him some money.

310
00:49:29,995 --> 00:49:31,489
不够
It's not enough.

311
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,957
还有吗?  这是县里的罚款?
 Do we have more? Only the fine for the country.

312
00:49:33,957 --> 00:49:35,801
给他
Give it to him.

313
00:49:42,007 --> 00:49:43,845
不够
It's still not enough.

314
00:49:48,096 --> 00:49:50,634
卖皮子
Sell the pelts.

315
00:49:50,682 --> 00:49:53,529
我去追他们
I'm going after the gunman.

316
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,813
走花圆沟进来
You take the route through Huatugou.

317
00:49:56,313 --> 00:49:57,736
好
Okay.

318
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:26,022
保重  保重
 Good luck. Good luck.

319
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:38,408
再见  再见
 Goodbye. Goodbye.

320
00:50:49,074 --> 00:50:52,134
保重
Be safe.

321
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:59,779
再见
Goodbye.

322
00:51:18,145 --> 00:51:21,170
局长,吃的没有了
Captain, we're almost out of food.

323
00:51:21,273 --> 00:51:22,625
能撑多少天?
How much do we have left?

324
00:51:22,691 --> 00:51:25,989
两天,不包括犯人的
Two days worth for us. Not counting the prisoners.

325
00:51:26,445 --> 00:51:29,781
油也不多了,还剩最后一桶 现在回去...
Fuel's nearly gone, too. We should turn back...

326
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:32,248
回去不可能!
No way!

327
00:51:32,909 --> 00:51:34,190
还能开几天?
How much fuel is there?

328
00:51:34,995 --> 00:51:38,293
三、四天,卡车可能带不上
Four days if we give up the truck.

329
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,448
三、四天应该就成
That should allow us to catch them.

330
00:52:12,783 --> 00:52:15,108
退后
Step back.

331
00:52:28,173 --> 00:52:30,498
把手铐打开
Remove the handcuffs.

332
00:52:37,808 --> 00:52:39,196
马哲立
Ma Zhanlin.

333
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:44,121
每次我抓到你,你都是罚款
Every time I catch you, you pay a fine.

334
00:52:44,606 --> 00:52:47,761
这次不罚了,让你走
This time I'm letting you go without a fine.

335
00:52:47,985 --> 00:52:49,681
真好走啊?
Really?

336
00:52:49,945 --> 00:52:51,854
嗯,我放你走
Yes.

337
00:52:51,905 --> 00:52:54,266
我走不出去,我老了
I'm too old to make it back from here.

338
00:52:55,033 --> 00:53:00,205
我没粮食给你们吃,油也不多了
I don't have food for you, and I'm short of fuel.

339
00:53:01,623 --> 00:53:05,751
我还要抓你们的老板,我管不了
I'm going after your boss. I can't take care of you.

340
00:53:05,877 --> 00:53:07,431
我走不出去
I can't make it.

341
00:53:07,504 --> 00:53:11,300
马哲立,你走得出去
Yes, you can.

342
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,395
到艾尔山走200多公里
It's 200 kilometers to the Al Mountain.

343
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,981
到昆仑山口100多公里
And 100 more to the Kunlun Pass.

344
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:20,661
你能走出去
You can make it.

345
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:27,211
确实走不出去,就是你的命
If you don't make it, then it's your fate.

346
00:53:30,068 --> 00:53:31,728
保重
Good luck.

347
00:53:50,088 --> 00:53:52,829
愿神保佑你
May God be with you.

348
00:54:39,972 --> 00:54:43,341
第十天:布格达班峰
DAY 10: BUGEDABAN PEAK

349
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:16,100
啥回事?
What's wrong?

350
00:55:16,341 --> 00:55:17,350
引擎坏了
The engine's gone.

351
00:55:17,509 --> 00:55:18,968
油也没了
Out of oil.

352
00:55:19,094 --> 00:55:21,347
出发的时候为什么不检查?
Why didn't you check the oil before?

353
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:23,755
车子都开两天了
We've been going nonstop for two days.

354
00:55:24,474 --> 00:55:25,898
还能修吗?
Can you fix it?

355
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:32,991
你们在这儿等刘栋
Wait here for Liu Dong.

356
00:55:37,154 --> 00:55:38,850
我们走
Let's go.

357
00:55:47,706 --> 00:55:50,553
保重
Good luck.

358
00:55:54,296 --> 00:55:57,250
保重!
Good luck!

359
00:56:14,483 --> 00:56:16,665
刘栋能找到他们吗?
Can Liu Dong find them?

360
00:56:17,653 --> 00:56:19,978
但愿不要下雪
If it doesn't snow.

361
00:56:46,974 --> 00:56:51,280
第十二天
DAY 12

362
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:03,606
第十五天
DAY 15

363
00:58:25,155 --> 00:58:29,983
医生
Doctor.

364
00:59:00,565 --> 00:59:02,962
医生
Doctor.

365
00:59:05,862 --> 00:59:08,045
起来
Get up.

366
00:59:08,073 --> 00:59:11,656
这个长凳是给病人的,你的朋友没事
This bench is for patients. Your friend is all right.

367
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:01,906
你要干嘛?我还在工作
What do you want? I'm still working.

368
01:00:02,336 --> 01:00:04,518
你去哪里去了这么久?
Where have you been for so long?

369
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:06,574
你真是一团糟
You're a mess.

370
01:00:07,424 --> 01:00:11,588
我在工作,放手
I'm working. Let go of me.

371
01:00:31,573 --> 01:00:33,934
冷不冷,穿个鱼网?
Aren't you cold in those fishnets?

372
01:00:35,202 --> 01:00:36,862
工作服
It's my working outfit.

373
01:00:46,088 --> 01:00:48,164
你到底要什么?
What do you want from me anyway?

374
01:00:48,465 --> 01:00:51,763
看你这个样子 跟个神经病一样
You look like a lunatic.

375
01:01:06,775 --> 01:01:08,542
不说话装什么聋子
Are you playing deaf now?

376
01:01:09,903 --> 01:01:11,042
我想你!
I miss you!

377
01:01:12,072 --> 01:01:14,017
你想我却不来看我
You miss me but you didn't come to see me.

378
01:01:14,074 --> 01:01:15,663
我巡山去了
I went patrolling.

379
01:01:16,451 --> 01:01:18,563
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

380
01:01:21,999 --> 01:01:24,145
我需要点钱
I need some money.

381
01:01:25,419 --> 01:01:27,400
怎么每次来找我都这样!
You pull this shit every time I see you!

382
01:01:27,587 --> 01:01:30,090
李序  你以为我开银行?
 Lengxue. Do you think I own a bank?

383
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,195
是不是拿我的钱养其他女人?
Did you spend my money on other women?

384
01:01:59,036 --> 01:02:02,131
我不知道你怎么能过那种生活
I don't know how you can live that crazy life.

385
01:02:03,957 --> 01:02:06,246
我只想跟你在一起
I just want to be with you.

386
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,932
我要走了
I'm leaving.

387
01:02:29,441 --> 01:02:32,561
你很快就把我给忘记了
You'll forget me soon.

388
01:02:36,198 --> 01:02:39,258
再找另一个姑娘跟你在一起
And find yourself another girl.

389
01:03:08,522 --> 01:03:09,660
李序
Lengxue.

390
01:03:51,273 --> 01:03:54,369
马哲立他们能不能活着走出去?
Can Ma Zhanlin make it out alive?

391
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,599
你的人呢?
What about your men?

392
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:30,154
但愿不要下雪
I hope it doesn't snow.

393
01:05:26,702 --> 01:05:27,947
怎么啦?
What's wrong?

394
01:05:27,995 --> 01:05:31,090
他们没找到我们
They'll never find us.

395
01:05:31,248 --> 01:05:33,917
咱们走不出去了
We're going to die here.

396
01:05:34,376 --> 01:05:36,321
闭嘴!
Shut up!

397
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:17,101
你们现在最大的困难是什么?
Your whole situation looks pretty desperate.

398
01:06:17,127 --> 01:06:22,062
钱也没有,人也没有,枪也没有
We're short of money, short of men, short of guns.

399
01:06:24,301 --> 01:06:28,228
我的弟兄们一年没拿钱了
My guys haven't been paid for almost a year.

400
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:32,857
县里不能解决经费问题吗?
Can the country help?

401
01:06:35,145 --> 01:06:37,577
我们没编制
We're not officially employed.

402
01:06:41,401 --> 01:06:43,868
队里的经费是不是特别紧张?
How do you pay for the patrol?

403
01:06:45,238 --> 01:06:47,564
都是我们自己解决
We have to raise the money ourselves.

404
01:06:48,617 --> 01:06:53,623
你们怎么处理缴回来的皮子?
What do you do with the pelts?

405
01:06:54,998 --> 01:06:57,738
大部分都上缴
We hand most of them over to the authorities.

406
01:06:58,335 --> 01:07:02,926
你们会不会也卖一部份皮子来解决经费问题?
Do you sell some to raise the money?

407
01:07:52,681 --> 01:07:55,907
卖皮子是违法的
Selling the pelts is illegal.

408
01:07:59,313 --> 01:08:02,408
你说我该怎么写这篇报导?
How should I write the article?

409
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,309
我一直认为我是个好记者...
I always thought I was a good journalist...

410
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,578
我知道你是记者
I know you're a reporter.

411
01:08:09,072 --> 01:08:13,450
这可可西里 就是你们记者保护得来的吗?
You think Kekexili can be protected by reporters?

412
01:08:18,415 --> 01:08:20,597
我知道会进监狱
I'll go to prison if I have to.

413
01:08:22,002 --> 01:08:24,149
我知道卖皮子是犯法的
I know selling pelts is illegal.

414
01:08:24,421 --> 01:08:27,410
但我现在不会考虑你说的
But I can't worry about that now.

415
01:08:28,091 --> 01:08:30,345
我只考虑可可西里...
I can only think about Kekexili...

416
01:08:30,427 --> 01:08:32,230
考虑我的兄弟
and my brothers.

417
01:08:34,931 --> 01:08:37,399
见过朝圣的人吗?
Ever seen protestors on a pilgrimage?

418
01:08:38,435 --> 01:08:40,688
他们的手和脸脏得很
Their faces and hands are filthy.

419
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:44,082
可他们的心特别干净
But their hearts are pure.

420
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:53,451
我卖过皮子
I've sold pelts before.

421
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:56,704
可我没办法
I had no choice.

422
01:10:28,712 --> 01:10:31,632
翻过雪山就是公路
The highway's on the other side of the mountains.

423
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:35,237
我们必须在他们上公路之前追上他们
We have to catch them before they get there.

424
01:10:36,803 --> 01:10:39,270
看看四周有没有吃的
Look around for something to eat.

425
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:51,559
子弹多不多?
How many bullets do we have?

426
01:10:52,444 --> 01:10:53,867
还有几十发
A few dozen.

427
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:08,835
宜兴以前是做什么的?
Yixi, what did you do before this?

428
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,099
上学
I was a student.

429
