来个小鸟低杆球
He birdies here,

4
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,841
穿着绿色上衣走开
he walks away with the green jacket.

5
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,442
靠
Fuck!

6
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,780
太好了
Wonderful.

7
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,600
你迟到了
You're late.

8
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,600
问问这个狗娘养等下我们有什么大不了的

9
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:25,600
告诉你老板  我会西班牙语
他再叽叽歪歪  我就干他娘的

10
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:31,183
- The weapons? - It's on the boat. The cash?
-武器呢  -在船上  钱呢

-有点轻哦  -先给4万5千美元

12
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,424
武器到手之后
The rest you'll get wired into an account of your choosing

13
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,326
-剩下的钱你给个账号我网上转账给你  -不行  不行  不行
- once we get the weapons. - No, no, no!

14
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,662
这太扯淡了  我们事先可不是这样说的
This is bullshit! This is not what we agreed on!

15
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,331
嘿  帕波罗  马可  皮佩  管你叫啥名字
Hey, Pablo, paco, pepe, whatever the fuck your name is.

16
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,633
别动船上的武器
Leave the weapons on the boat.

17
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,569


18
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:54,569


19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,174
好  好说
Okay. Fine.

20
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,569

21
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,643
你想玩我是吧  那我们来好好玩玩
You want to play games? I'll play games.

22
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:00,212
事先提醒你  我讨厌玩心眼
But I'll have you know, I hate games.

事实上  我小学没毕业的原因
In fact, I quit grade school

25
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,948

I didn't realize this is let's make a deal. Okay, monty.

瑞恩  去拿包  去拿武器
Ryan, get the bags, get the weapons.

00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,426
这可不好  老兄
Not cool, hombre.

41
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,337
这事我习惯了  兄弟
I can do this all day, amigo.

42
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,805
靠
Fuck!

罗根  罗根

00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,650
罗根
Logan!

48
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,708
这就是现今社会的悲伤写照
Well, this is a sad commentary on today's society.

49
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,045
杰克  别往心里去
Don't take it too personal, Jack.

50
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:43,315
别骗自己了  搭档  怎么能不在意呢
Don't kid yourself, partner. It's always personal.

51
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,900
顺便问下  我干掉最后两个家伙的时候
Ps, where the fuck were you

52
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:45,484
你死那里去了
on those last two?

53
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:49,288
老大  基本射击要领  枪目线过于模糊
Marksmanship 101, boss. Gun-target line was shit.

54
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,757
我射击用的是点308麦格伦弹
I'm firing .308 win mags.

55
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,726
啊  对了  你头发里沾了点脑浆
Oh, by the way, you got some brain in your hair.

56
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,697
-老天  -这个距离  一颗点308弹
- Jesus Christ! - At this range, a .308 woulda ripped right through

57
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,575
会直穿过你刚杀的"生意伙伴"
your recently deceased business partners

58
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:03,302
在你胸口爆个大洞
and left you with a sucking chest wound.

59
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,438
幸好你没干  好了  大伙儿撤吧
Well, good to know. All right, let's get the hell out of here.

60
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,373
马上过来  老板大人
On my way, boss man.

61
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,618
那个帅小伙的弹夹有真子弹是怎么回事
What happened with Gabriel's rounds?

62
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,653
我拿不到他的备用弹夹
I couldn't get to his spare mags.

63
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,690
-他会注意到的  -会害死人的
- He would have noticed! - That could have been bad.

64
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,814
-差点而已  -
- Could have. -

65
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:28,060
顺便说下  你这两个家伙都是蠢材
You guys are fucking idiots, by the way.

66
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,797
空包弹这种计策玩多了会出事的
How many more times you think you're going to get away with this blanks shit?

67
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,799
你的语气听来好像很关心这事
Is that concern I hear in your voice?

68
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,368
当然  这可关系到我的前途啊
Yeah, concern for my future employment.

69
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,806
我的综合技能在星巴克可找不到相应的职位
My skill set doesn't exactly translate to working at Starbucks.

70
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,709
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

71
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,110
够走运的话
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.

72
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,678
过几个星期会再见面
If you're lucky.

73
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,648
得了  出点力嘛  一起来
Come on, let's see what you got. Come on. There you go.

74
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,517
嘿  嘿  嘿  别这么大力推我
Hey, hey, hey. Don't push me too hard.

艾迪  爱德华的简称

77
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,742
能给我拿条毛巾吗
Can you grab me a towel?

78
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,823
这是什么
What the fuck is this?

79
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,259
-你指什么  -这照片
- What the fuck is what? - This!

80
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,331
-你那儿找到的  -简娜会气疯的
- Where'd you find that? - Jenna would be pissed.

81
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:31,202
-简娜和我仅仅  简娜和我  我只是说
- Jenna and me have only-- - Jenna and I. I'm just saying.

82
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:35,006
简娜和我才约会了几个星期
Jenna and I have only been dating for a few weeks.

83
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,976
-我要把这照片扔了  -
- I'm throwing this out. -

84
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,110
好  我不在乎  扔掉它吧
Fine. I don't care. Throw it out.

85
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:50,155
哇  印象深刻啊
Wow. I'm impressed.

86
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,924
说说看  距最后一次听到她的消息  过多久了
When's the last time you heard from her, anyway?

87
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,627
不好说
I don't know.

88
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,899
六个月吧
Six months.

89
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,622
杰克  知道么  你可真是个没骨气的奇葩
You're a real nutless wonder, you know that, Jack?

90
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,259
实话说  你究竟见过她没有
Honestly. What the hell did you ever see in her?

91
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:33,665
所有人趴下
Everybody down!

92
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:38,203
听到没  快行动
Get that. Let's go!

93
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,807
-爱德华  你好  -很高兴你终于接了电话
- Hello, Edward. - So glad you picked up.

94
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,676
我正忙着呢
I'm kind of in the middle of something right now,

95
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,378
要不回头打给你吧
so I'll probably just call you back.

96
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,780
我知道你在那儿  也清楚你正在干什么
I know where you are and I know what you are doing.

97
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,115
难道你忘了
Or did you forget who planned

98
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,083
这一切最早出是谁的计划吗
this little trip in the first place?

99
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,985
艾迪  是你叫停它的
You called this job off, Eddie.

100
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,985
艾迪  是你叫停这个计划的
You called this job off, Eddie.

101
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,087
所以你不能责怪我提前行事
So you can't blame me for going ahead with this.

102
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,248
我还是得责怪你
But I do blame you.

103
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:58,923
你正在执行我酝酿成熟的计划
You're doing a job that I planned.

104
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,613
这计划是我从头到尾设计好的
A job that I set up.

105
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:02,060
你可要付我"中介费"哦
There are finder's fees associated with it.

106
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:05,030
你的计划自己叫停  我决定继续执行而已
Your job you called off and I decided to move forward with?

107
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:09,100
凯伦  没我的首肯  没我的参与
Without me. Without my permission, Karen.

108
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,236
爱德华  你要什么
What do you want, Eddie?

109
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,971
-我全部的分成  -那是多少
- My full share. - Which is?

110
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:16,107
-100%分成  -不是说好60%吗
- One hundred percent. - What happened to 60?

111
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,844
另外40%算是你对我侮辱的补偿
Well, the additional 40 is for the indignity that I have suffered.

112
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,714
-没门
- No fucking way.

113
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:26,151
凯伦  别这么说
Yes fucking way, Karen.

114
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,119
你报了警吗
You called the cops?

115
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,021
我还能说什么  你做的事真伤感情
What can I say? My feelings were hurt.

116
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,118
-你将什么都得不到  -
- You'll get nothing. -

117
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,123
早就想给你个难忘的教训
A price I would gladly pay

118
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,859
这个代价我认为值得
to teach you a long overdue lesson.

119
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,038
现在  格伦
Now, Glenn,

120
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,041
跟我说说为什么你的领带像沾过屎一样
why is it that these ties look like they were dipped in shit?

121
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:54,913
-你是说屎吗  费罗萨先生  -屎
- Shit, Mr. filosa? - Shit. Yes.

122
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,082
先生  你要求的深红色树状条纹
Sir, you asked for Scarlet forest,

123
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,017
我确信这些领带的颜色正是你要的
and I assure you these ties are all Scarlet forest.

124
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,119
-你跟我保证这颜色是对的吗  -是的  先生
- You're assuring me that? - Yes, sir.

125
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:05,023
我跟你说这些领带像沾过屎一样
I'm assuring you that they look like they were dipped in shit.

126
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,862
看看这个
See this?

127
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,274
看看这个颜色
See this color?

128
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:15,900
等它干了  才会是我想要的领带颜色
When that dries, that's the color I want on these ties.

129
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,104
-是的  先生  -你可以走了
- Yes, sir. - Off you go.

130
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,616
假如凯伦能活着出来
If Karen makes it out alive,

131
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:29,080
她将不得不搭乘原来那班飞机
she'll have no choice but to take her original flight.

132
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,483
把她知道的一切都给我挖出来
I need to know exactly what she knows.

133
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,785
明白  先生
Yes, sir.

134
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,224
只剩几天功夫了
It's only a matter of days now.

135
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:43,394
这个计划  我的计划就在那里
This job, my job is right out there.

136
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:46,865
可不能让凯伦给搞砸了
We can't let Karen fuck it up.

137
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,408
-绝对不行  -为什么
- Absolutely fucking not. - Why not?

138
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,257
原因嘛  你借我狗狗
Why? 'Cause the fact that you borrow my dog

139
00:12:59,258 --> 00:13:02,213
只不过想讨你那兽医女友的欢心罢了
in order to trick your veterinarian girlfriend

140
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,249
一想到你是个动物爱好者就觉得可悲
to thinking you're an animal lover is pathetic.

141
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:07,552
我一向是动物爱好者  只不过没养过宠物而已
I am an animal lover, I'm just not an animal owner.

142
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,338
-你真的喜欢这个女人么  -
- Do you even like this woman? -

143
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,122
当然  我喜欢她  非常喜欢
Yes, I like this woman. I like her a lot.

144
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,825
那为什么一直对她撒谎
Then why do you continue to lie to her?

145
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,161
我撒谎是因为我爱她
I lie to her because I like her!

146
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:19,264
哈  哼  你说话像个需要慰藉的男人
Ha. Well, spoken like a true man.

147
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,067
别说了
Stop it.

148
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,808
明天上午把狗还给我
I want her home by morning.

149
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:40,118
前台  是的  他在这儿  好  我转告他
Reception. Yeah, he's right here. All right, I'll let him know.

150
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,017
她准备好见你了
She's ready for you.

151
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:42,587
康纳医生跟海狮一起待在后面
Dr. Connor's in the back with a sea lion, okay?

152
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,346
-起来  我们走  -
- Let's go. Come on. -

153
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:46,424
啊  对了  她最喜欢雏菊
Oh. And daisies are her favorites.

154
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:51,129
-你懂的  下次带上  -多谢相告
- You know, for next time. - Now you tell me.

155
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,968
-干得好
- Good job.

156
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,304
过来
Come on.

157
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:07,212
凯利  它今天好多了
She's doing much better today, Kerry.

158
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,916
医生  我这里有个病狗狗
I have another patient for you, Doc.

159
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:16,187
嗨  格雷丝
Hi, Grace! Hi!

160
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,456
-我想它记得你  -应该是
- I think she remembers you. - I think so.

161
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,326
-这些花是给我的吗  -对
- Are those for me? - Yes.

162
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,261
-爱煞玫瑰了  -噢
- I love roses. - Yeah.

163
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:26,531
-协商的事怎么样  -我干掉了他们
- How was the conference? - I knocked them dead.

164
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,867
当然  我就知道
Of course. I knew you would.

165
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,135
-今晚共进晚餐好吗  -唔...两个条件
- How about dinner tonight? - Hmm... two conditions.

166
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,303
-尽管说  -你下厨
- Name them. - You cook.

167
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,639
-好说  -格雷丝得在场
- Done. - And Grace is there.

168
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,307
当然  格雷丝总赖在那儿
Of course. Grace will always be there.

169
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,276
-嗨  宝贝  -格雷丝  她是谁呀
- Hi, baby. Hi! - Who's that, Grace?

170
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,655
刚有手下给我电话  她已经到了机场
One of my men just called. They spotted her arriving at the airport.

171
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,191
-他们正跟踪着她  -她一个人做不来
- They're following her now. - She can't do it alone.

172
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:56,094
-找出她的帮手  -好的  先生
- Find them. - Yes, sir.

173
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:48,279
格雷丝  格雷丝  闭嘴
Grace! Grace, shut up!

174
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,528
杰克...
Mm, Jack...

175
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,301
-天啦  我靠
- Jesus! Fuck!

176
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,970
嗨
Hi.

177
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,005
你来这儿干什么
What the fuck are you doing here?

178
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,975
杰克  很高兴见到你
Good to see you too, Jack.

179
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,278
你怀孕了
Are you pregnant?

180
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,549
你家的剩菜看起来好美味  我去吃点
I'm going to go eat your leftovers 'cause they look delicious.

181
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,251
你俩接着办事
And I'll let you two finish up here.

182
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,724
我得说一句  记得戴套套哦
Use a condom. That's all I'm going to say.

183
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:36,661
杰克  那女人是谁
Jack, who is that woman?

184
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,473
-喂  -我找到他们了  先生
- Yeah. - I found them, sir.

185
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,141
-好  -他们活不过明天早晨
- Good. - They'll be dead by morning.

186
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,543
-事情办好  -是  先生
- Finish it. - Yes, sir.

187
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,040
-几个月了  -有番茄酱吗
- How many months? - Got any pickles?

188
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:26,310
-凯伦... -是你的孩子
- Karen... - It's yours.

189
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,783
我明白  刚开始那会儿我也拒绝接受事实
I know. I was in denial too for a little while.

190
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,318
哀伤的五个阶段嘛  那是第一个阶段
It's the first of five stages of grief.

191
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,187
-那么  有...你TMD上那儿去了
- Then there is-- - where the fuck have you been?!

192
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,523
接着是愤怒
Then there's anger.

193
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,392
-我得走了  -噢  简娜...简娜
- I'm going to go. - Oh! Jenna... Jenna.

194
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,096
简娜  别  真对不起  你知道我
Jenna, please, I'm so sorry about this, you know... I...

195
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,799
格雷丝  别吵
Grace! Please!

196
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,400
-要我回头给你电话吗  -好  那当然
- Do you want to call me later? - Yes, of course.

197
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,336
等我一下  格雷丝  格雷丝  别叫了
Gimme a second. Grace. Grace, knock it off!

198
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,739
对不起  等我一下  我陪你...
I'm sorry. Just give me one second, I'll walk you...

199
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,409
格雷丝  得了  闭嘴
Grace! Come on, girl. Shut up!

200
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,083
噢  见鬼
Oh, shit!

201
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,720
简娜  你得听我的说
Jenna, I need you to listen to me.

202
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,689
马上就有很危险的事情发生
Something very dangerous is about to happen.

203
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,759
别问任何问题  明白吗
You can not ask any questions. Do you understand me?

204
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,494
-什么  -你刚提了个问题
- What? - That was a question!

205
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,756
枪  你有枪
Guns? You have guns?

206
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,326
杰克  那是个手雷吗
Jack, is that a grenade?

207
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,698
什么  杰克
What? Jack!

208
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,702
-你我之间得谈谈  -现在吗
- You and me are going to talk. - Now?

209
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,538
-快去船那儿  -快走
- Get to the boat. - Let's go.

210
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,636
-跑  快跑  快跑
- Move! Move! Move!

211
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,173
快点  简娜  进船里去
Let's go! Come on, Jenna, get in the boat!

212
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:41,679
快  狗狗  快进来
Come on, girl! Let's go!

213
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,450
-凯伦  趴低  -在码头那儿
- Karen, get down! - The dock!

214
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,654
追  快追  快点追
Move, move, move!

215
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,528
快上船
Get on the boat!

216
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,527
-杰克  -凯伦  你等下
- Jack! - Give me a minute, Karen.

217
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,495
-但我... -你没看到我竖起手指吗
- Yeah, but i-- - did you see the finger?!

218
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,397
-杰克  我看到了  -竖着手指是说
- Yes, Jack, I see the finger! - Well, the finger means

219
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,186
-我需要一分钟思考的时间  -
- I need one minute to think! -

220
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:37,301
他们追上来了
Here they come!

221
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:43,241
你在做什么
What are you doing?

222
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,610
-我在打电话报警  -给我手机
- I'm calling the police! - Give me that!

223
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,612
别叫警察
There's no calling the police!

224
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,885
啊
Ah!

225
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,683
-杰克  我们这是去那里  -
- Where are we going, Jack? -

226
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:03,461
简娜  那里安全去那里
Somewhere safe, Jenna.

227
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,380
-凯伦  好了  开枪  -
- Okay, Karen, go. -

228
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:08,833
有人认为我偷了他的东西
Someone thinks I stole from him.

229
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,435
-凯伦  你偷了吗  -什么
- Did you? Karen! - What?!

230
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,272
-你偷了人家东西吗  -没
- Did you steal from someone? - No!

231
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,775
上帝保佑  事前你怎么不仔细想想
Jesus Christ! Do you ever think anything through?!

232
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,186
哦  别跟我说做事鲁莽那套屁话
Oh, don't talk to me about thinking things through!

233
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:21,746
你总是想得多  做得少
You over analyze everything!

234
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,039
我喜欢事前计划
I like to plan!

235
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,049
才不会像你这样落到今天的境地
I like to plan so I don't get into shit like this!

236
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:29,720
别吵了  把注意力转到那帮追杀者那儿吧
Please just pay attention to the people trying to kill us!

237
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,022
开快点  开快点  追上去
Faster! Faster! Let's go!

238
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,204
-我在爱德华・费罗萨那里接了一个活  -
- I ran a job for Eddie filosa. -

239
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:36,060
哦  这是第一个错误
Oh, mistake number one.

240
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,329
-你认识他吗  -打过交道
- You know him? - I know of him.

241
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,767
出了岔子  事情没做成
Well, the job went south and we lost the score.

242
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,468
再正常不过
Well, that happens.

243
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,874
哦  你去跟爱德华说吧  他要我赔偿损失
Yeah, well, tell that to Eddie. He wants me to make good for it!

244
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,778
-所有损失吗  -所有损失
- All of it? - All of it!

245
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,884
-多大  -非常大
- How big? - Huge!

246
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:01,324
-这不合常理  -
- That's not very rational. -

247
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:03,721
杰克  爱德华喜欢不按常理出牌
Eddie's not exactly rational, Jack.

248
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:11,729
-她没事吧  -没事
- Is she okay? - She's fine.

249
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:14,441
-罗根的狗跟着我们做什么  -
- What is Logan's dog even doing here? -

250
00:22:14,442 --> 00:22:16,067
格雷丝是罗根的狗吗
Grace is Logan's dog?

251
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,936
-她还不知道吗  -我正想告诉你
- She didn't know? - I was going to tell you.

252
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,505
杰克  你要讲的是事实的那一部分
You were going to tell me what part, Jack?

253
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,743
是关于格雷丝不是你的狗
That Grace isn't yours,

254
00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:24,542
还是关于你把前女友搞大了肚子
that you got an ex-girlfriend pregnant,

255
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:26,811
还是你是某种超级大罪犯
or that you're some type of uber-criminal?!

256
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:29,447
杰克  她说得有道理
She's got a point, Jack.

257
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:35,086
开快点  追上去
Come on, faster! Go!

258
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,828
你能干掉那个摩托艇吗
Can you take out that jet ski?

259
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,731
这枪没子弹了  当然我能干掉摩托艇
I'm out! Of course I can take out the jet ski!

260
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,972
你这枪有问题
There's something wrong with your gun!

261
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,707
凯伦  我的枪没问题
There's nothing wrong with my gun, Karen.

262
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,376
哦  真的么
Oh, really?

263
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,411
那为什么不让这位"当代女友"试试
Then why don't we let "this year's model" give it a try?

264
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:01,480
-别太过分  -
- Just leave her alone. -

265
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:04,148
为什么  我懂了  她喜欢躺在后面避风头
Why? I know she likes to just lay on her back,

266
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,950
也许她应该帮我们分担点压力
but maybe she wants to participate more.

267
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,686
杰克  你怎么看上这种女人的
What the hell did you ever see in this woman, Jack?

268
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,756
我接受他开着灯做爱的习惯  够了吧
I gave him a reason to fuck with the lights on!

269
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:23,501
-杰克  -什么
- Jack! - What?

270
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,902
摩托艇都干掉了
There are no more jet skis.

271
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,971
坏消息是  枪也没有了
The bad news, no more guns.

272
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:30,074
-还剩下什么  -霰弹枪
- What do we got left? - A shotgun.

273
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,145
这么远的距离  打不中的
We're never going to hit them from this distance.

274
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,914
-我要让船做平旋运动  -真的吗
- I'm going to flatspin the boat. - Really?

275
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,618
就像在巴西那次
Just like Brazil.

276
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,710
啊
Ah!

277
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,764
凯伦  你来掌方向
Karen! Take the wheel!

278
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,966
-把它弄出去  -快上
- Get her out of here! - Go!

279
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:35,039
杰克  你要干什么
Jack, what are you doing? Jack!

280
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,131
你他妈的
Fucking bitch!

281
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,888
-我靠  -天啦
- Oh, shit! - Oh, god!

282
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,740
操
Fuck!

283
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:48,913
格雷丝  过来这里  狗狗  快来
Grace, get over here, girl. Come on!

284
00:25:56,689 --> 00:26:00,624
你还好吧
Are you all right?

285
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,235
-简娜  能跟你谈几句吗  -好
- Jenna, can I talk to you for a minute, please? - Yeah.

286
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,974
我要你找个旅馆住上几天
I need you to get a hotel for the next few days.

287
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:19,076
请个病假  别告诉同事你去那里
Call in sick to work. Don't tell them where you are.

288
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,045
不想去旅馆  我要回家
I don't want to get a hotel. I want to go home.

289
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,047
我明白你现在有点不知所措
I understand you're a bit overwhelmed right now,

290
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,915
但我过去多次遇到这种情况
but I've been through these things in the past, a few times.

291
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,685
你一定要相信我
You're just going to have to trust me.

292
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:29,300
-你一起来吗  -
- Are you coming with me? -

293
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:31,989
现在不行  过阵子我会来看你的
Not right now, but I'll come back to check on you.

294
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:34,024
你要跟她一起走么
Are you going somewhere with her?

295
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,927
很不巧  我得跟她去
Yeah. Unfortunately.

296
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,630
我得搞清楚究竟发生了什么  找出解决方案
I need to figure out what's going on. I need some answers.

297
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,365
跟你在一起可办不成事
I'm not going to get those with you around.

298
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:43,734
-你要给她上水刑吗  -不
- Are you going to waterboard her? - No.

299
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,970
我不会给她上水刑的  我只是..
I'm not going to waterboard her, I just...

300
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,005
我只是不想让你再进一步卷入事中
I just don't want you to get more involved than you already are.

301
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,307
我觉得你该给她上水刑
I think you should waterboard her.

302
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:55,045
好了  关于这一切...我非常抱歉
Okay. I'm sorry... About all this.

303
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:59,049
-我也是  -罗根明天早晨会来领格雷丝
- Me too. - Logan'll be by in the morning to pick up Grace.

304
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,884
好
Okay.

305
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:25,009
格雷丝  最惨的部分是  约会太糟糕了
The saddest part, Grace, I've had worse dates.

306
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:37,321
嘿  你们中有人知道老板在那儿吗
Anyone seen the boss? Hey!

307
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,690
有人知道吗
Anyone seen the boss?

308
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:42,059
真像...
Like really...

309
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,328
搞什么  你们这帮小娘们
What the fuck? You bitches.

310
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,399
你搞什么  有病啊你  神经
What the fuck? What's your problem, psycho?

311
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,100
你  "****"
You. Dick breath.

312
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,670
嘿  别这样子对我们说话
Hey! You can't talk to us like that.

313
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,304
你不服
Yes, I can.

314
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:55,338
你们有什么问题
What's the matter with you?

315
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:57,274
你究竟在这儿干什么  女孩们
What the fuck are you doing, girls?

316
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,977
我来问你个问题  你们怎么理财的
Let me ask you a question. How do you invest your money?

317
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,446
-什么  -理财
- What? - Invest.

318
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:05,449
艾迪付你们钱的  对不  那些钱你们怎么用
Eddie pays you, right? What do you do with your money?

319
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,819
-用来买东西  -买些什么
- I buy shit. - You buy shit like what?

320
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,021
-鞋子  -鞋子  还有呢
- Shoes. - Shoes. And?

321
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,090
-漂亮的鞋子  -太好了  还有别的吗
- Nice shoes. - Great. What else?

322
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:16,360
-胸前的大咪咪  -漂亮着呢
- These boobs. - They're nice boobs, by the way.

323
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,296
硬汉  有话直说  没功夫跟你耗一天
What's your point, tough guy? We don't have all day.

324
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:23,867
我的意思是你们也许有两三年功夫
My point is you got about two, maybe three more years

325
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,304
出卖自己的身体  然后呢
of whoring yourself out before a whole new batch of younger

326
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:30,708
等着一帮更年青漂亮的小妞
and prettier whores comes rolling in through that front door.

327
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,376
从那扇大门进来取代你们
And all you're going to have to show for it

328
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:36,046
而你们剩下的不过是满柜的旧鞋子和破败的身体
is a closet full of old shoes, and a banged up pussy.

329
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:40,818
如果我是女人  像你这般年青  这般好身材
Now, if I had a vagina, and I had your ass,

330
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,088
这般美貌  我肯定会攒钱攒到百万身家
and your fucking tits, I'd be a fucking millionaire.

331
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,133
幸亏  好心的上帝保佑
Instead, the good lord blessed me

332
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:47,991
我做了有道德感的男人
with a big dick and moral flexibility.

333
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:52,062
所以...我只多问一次
So... I'm going to ask you one more time,

334
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,733
不给个满意的回答我就狠狠地抽你们
or I swear to god I'm going to bitch-slap you so hard,

335
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:59,369
直到把你们打残为止  明白吗
your brand-new tits are going to pop out of your ass. Understood?

336
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:03,173
-艾迪在那儿  -小套房
- Where's Eddie? - The cabana.

337
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,242
女孩们  祝你们今天愉快
You girls have a good day.

338
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,415
我们认识彼此很长时间了
We've known each other a long time.

339
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,774
你从来不喜欢前戏
You've never been one for foreplay,

340
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:15,219
要不你省下那些扯淡的话  跟我直说吧
so why don't you just spare me the bullshit.

341
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:18,856
告诉我你要什么
Tell me what you need.

342
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,194
-有个活儿  -我知道
- There's a job. - I knew it.

343
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:27,431
-杰克  听我说完  -如果我没记错的话
- Just hear me out, Jack. - If I remember correctly,

344
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:31,201
凯伦  上次我帮你  差点进了班房
the last time I helped you out, Karen, I almost ended up on the wrong side of the grass.

345
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,337
没记错的话  你甚至不怎么想帮我
If I remember correctly, you weren't exactly putting up a fight.

346
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,439
凯伦  算了吧
Forget it, Karen.

347
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:39,243
杰克  我遇到麻烦了  真正的麻烦
I'm in trouble, Jack. Real trouble.

348
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:42,279
-不是真需要帮忙  我也不会在这儿  -别人
- I wouldn't be here unless I needed... - Someone.

349
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,916
...你  我需要你帮忙
...you. Unless I needed you.

350
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:48,514
杰克  我失去了整个团队
I lost my entire crew, Jack.

351
00:29:48,515 --> 00:29:50,554
差点自己都没能活着出来
I barely got out alive.

352
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:51,209
事情搞砸了
And I lost the score.

353
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,824
艾迪要我赔偿所有损失  否则就杀了我
Eddie's going to kill me unless I pay him back.

354
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:57,161
这个活  大把的钱  小小的风险
This job? It's big money, small risk.

355
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:58,987
如果我们办成了
If we pull it off,

356
00:29:58,988 --> 00:30:02,232
就有足够的钱付给艾迪  还...
it's enough money to pay back Eddie and...

357
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:05,002
...剩余不少
...and then some.

358
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,348
什么活儿
What's the job?

359
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:24,154
我喜欢国际象棋  完美的隐喻生活
I like chess. It's a perfect metaphor for life.

360
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:28,125
每颗棋子都有固定的位置和走法  就像我们
Every piece is bound to its nature, just like people.

361
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:31,094
-西蒙  你怎么看  -我不下棋
- What do you think, Simon? - I don't play.

362
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:34,164
你该学学的  鲍勃  你会吗
You really should. What about you, Bob?

363
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,201
-我更喜欢玩扑克  -我喜欢扑克
- I'm more of a poker guy. - Yeah, I like poker.

364
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:40,270
也是个好游戏  都是关于把你想要的
Also a great game. All about trying to make the most of what you got--

365
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:44,041
当然  股东先生  你找我来这儿干什么
yeah, sure, Mr. f. Listen, could you tell me what I'm doing here?

366
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,977
耐心点儿  只耽搁你一点时间
Bear with me. This will just take a second.

367
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:50,013
我有个问题要问你  请把手放在圣经上
I want you to put your hand on this Bible. I have something to ask you

368
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,015
保证你所说的话句句属实
and I want you to be perfectly honest with me.

369
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,519
-能知道原因... -请迁就一下
- Don't know why... - Indulge me.

370
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,735
我非常欣赏扑克
I appreciate poker.

371
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:05,329
它象征着希望  一种充满梦幻
It's a game of hope. A game of dreams.

372
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:09,633
和谎言的游戏  但是国际象棋  象征着秩序
A game of lies. But chess, it's a game of order.

373
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:13,971
这个卒子只能向一个方向移动
This pawn can only move one way.

374
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:18,375
向前移动  只能从斜对方吃掉对手的棋子
Move forward, can only take diagonally.

375
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:23,213
卒子努力工作  也许有一天能更进一步
And if it works really hard, it can become something better,

376
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,613
改变地位  就像你
something more. Like you.

377
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:28,252
鲍勃  你就是个卒子
You're a pawn, rob.

378
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:32,222
卒子不能做的事包括不能泄密给敌人的王后
And what pawns do not do is tell secrets to the enemy queen

379
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,791
-希望对方给陪他上床  -
- in hopes that she'll fuck him. -

380
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,359
股东先生  我从没说过半句
Mr. f, I never said a word!

381
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:38,996
你要干什么  别  老天  我靠
What are you doing?! No! No! God! Fuck! God!

382
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,331
手掌里的神经多着呢
So many nerves in the hand.

383
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,334
老天  操  我什么都没说
God! Fuck! God! I said nothing!

384
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,826
鲍勃  我们现在不是在玩扑克
We're not playing poker now, Robert.

385
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:48,071
而是在玩国际象棋
We're playing chess.

386
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,375
我是国王  西蒙是我的骑士
I am the king, Simon is my knight.

387
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,377
别管它
Leave it.

388
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:57,047
如果你够小心  愿意做出牺牲
You are a pawn, and if you aren't careful,

389
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,216
你才能成为一个小卒子  明白吗
you are going to be sacrificed. Do you understand that?

390
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:02,252
-明白  明白  -现在  罗伯特
- Yeah. Yeah. - Now, Robert,

391
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,455
关于我近期的商业冒险
what exactly did you tell Karen

392
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,657
你具体告诉了凯伦那些
regarding my latest business ventures?

393
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,227
-我跟她讲了联邦东部的活儿  -哦
- I told her about the eastern federal job. - Yes.

394
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:14,331
-还有开曼群岛的活儿  -哦
- I told her about the Cayman Islands job. - Yes.

395
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:19,336
还告诉了她关于装甲车的事情
I told her about the armored car.

396
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:22,072
-装甲运输车  -是  是的  先生
- The armored car. - Yeah. Yes, sir.

397
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:26,276
-那就是说  -就是说她什么事都知道
- That means... - That means she knows everything.

398
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,615
罗伯特这事我们怎么处理好呢
What are we going to do with Robert?

399
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,586
你会杀了我
You're going to kill me.

400
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:40,223
终究会的  对
Eventually, yeah.

401
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,326
终究会的
Eventually.

402
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,401
-装甲运输车  -是啊  差不多那样
- Armored car? - Yeah. More or less.

403
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:57,274
-这运动很蠢  -值得一试
- It's a stupid sport. - It was a nice shot.

404
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,376
-别犯傻了  -给
- Don't be a dick. - Here.

405
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,249
你怎么想
So what do you think?

406
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:11,254
杰里・斯普林格

407
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:11,254
我想你绝对会在杰里・斯普林格的脱口秀中亮相的
I think you've definitely secured yourself a spot on the Jerry springer show.

408
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:15,258
-我是说这个活儿  -杰克  我懂你的意思
- I mean about the job. - I know what you mean, Jack.

409
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:18,996
跟她合作绝对没什么好事
Nothing, and I mean nothing good,

410
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,298
没什么好结果的  兄弟
can come from working with her, man.

411
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,334
-那孩子怎么办  -你确定是你的种么
- What about the baby? - Are you sure it's even yours?

412
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:28,438
兄弟  她离开这么久  天知道跟谁搞在一起
She's been gone, man, shacking up with only god knows what.

413
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,576
-喂  喂  -对不起
- Hey, hey. - Sorry.

414
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:36,346
我只是希望她变了性子
I just keep hoping she's changed.

415
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,616
她上单活儿搞砸之后
And after the last job that she had that went bad

416
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:42,019
怀着孩子来找我  只是...
and now the baby, I just...

417
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:46,323
觉得也许她最终会有所改变  想要...
Maybe she'll finally want something different, something... something else.

418
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:50,527
-直说吧  -我
- Just say it. - Me.

419
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:55,032
也许她最终想要我
Yeah. Maybe she'll finally want me.

420
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:58,468
格雷丝  过来这里  狗狗
Grace! Come here, girl.

421
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,171
过来  来这里
Come on. Come here.

422
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,851
变个贵宾犬的样子看下
Be a poodle, Grace.

423
00:34:02,852 --> 00:34:05,509
格雷丝  来  变成傻不拉叽的贵宾犬
Come on, be a little dumb-ass yippie poodle.

424
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,244
-来啊  -你在干吗
- Come on. - What're you doing?

425
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:09,379
-证明我的观点  -哦
- Proving a point. - Yeah?

426
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,481
-什么观点  -我不可能把
- Which is? - That I have a better chance

427
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:14,351
格雷丝变成一只傻傻的贵宾犬
of Grace turning into some dumb-ass poodle

428
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:18,355
你也不可能把一个冷血又控制欲极强的小婊子
than you do of getting this cold-hearted, manipulative bitch

429
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:21,191
变成安分守己的居家主妇
to settle down and live a normal life.

430
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:23,693
你以为未出世的孩子会改变她的本性吗
Oh, you think this kid is going to change who she is?

431
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:27,097
你以为那孩子会让她变得爱你吗
You think this kid is going to make her love you?

432
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,166
醒醒吧  朋友
Wake the fuck up, my friend.

433
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:33,270
她永远是那个凯伦  怀上孩子改变不了她
She's always going to be Karen. Now she's just Karen with a kid.

434
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,508
嗯
Yeah.

435
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,411
知道我为什么留着那张照片吗
You know why I keep that picture?

436
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,648
有一阵子我们总谈论要搬到圣.约翰岛去
There was a time when we used to talk about moving to St. John,

437
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,684
或其它类似的热带岛屿  开间潜水店
or some other tropical island, opening up a dive shop,

438
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,854
在世外桃源度过余生
living the rest of our lives in paradise.

439
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,556
就像海明威的小说里写的那样
Some real Hemingway-type shit.

440
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,658
那照片提醒着我为什么要...
And that picture was a reminder of why I do--

441
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,760
为什么我们要不停地争论这些
why we keep doing what we're doing.

442
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,647
你总是说什么风险啊
You're just taking these risks,

443
00:34:58,648 --> 00:35:01,665
不义之财来之不易啊  但...
and making easy money the hard way, but...

444
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:05,368
我不能永远这样干下去
I can't keep doing this shit forever.

445
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,041
只要有机会
So if there's even the slightest chance

446
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,671
那怕一丝把这个白日梦变成真实的机会
that I can make

447
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:11,641
我也会想办法抓住
that stupid fucking pipe dream a reality, I'm going for it.

448
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:17,114
罗根  你不欠我什么
You don't owe me anything, Logan.

449
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,350
别这么说
Don't say that.

450
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,487
别TMD这么说
Don't you fucking say that.

451
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,857
我们是朋友  不是吗  关系就像一家人
We're friends, right? Practically fucking family?

452
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:30,560
-是啊  -那就没什么欠不欠的
- Yeah. - Then it's not about owing me.

453
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,419
跟欠人情一点关系都没有
It was never about that.

454
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,431
家人  朋友之间不谈这个
It's what friends do, it's what family does.

455
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,633
家人...朋友之间就得互相支持
We... we back each other's plays,

456
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,469
那怕从一开始就知道他们错得离谱
even when we absolutely know they're fucked from the get go.

457
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:44,574
-对吧  -我猜是这么回事
- Right? - Yeah, I guess so.

458
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:49,579
不要说"我猜这么着"  事实就是这样
Mm... no. No "i guess so." That's the way it is.

459
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:52,482
-那么  -那么
- So? - So?

460
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,452
让我们放手去做吧
Let's do this.

461
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:57,721
你为什么这般暴躁
Why are you so grumpy?

462
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,765
-就是那辆卡车吗  -
- Is that the truck? -

463
00:36:10,766 --> 00:36:13,436
对  运送着价值3千万的宝石
That's the truck. 30 million in gems.

464
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,471
那是路线
That's the route.

465
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:17,207
-两天吗  -就两天
- Two days? - Two days.

466
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:24,281
-我们还得找个枪手  -必须的
- We're going to need a second gunman. - Definitely.

467
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:27,284
-还需要个好司机  -我知道上那儿找
- We're going to need a driver. - I know where to find one.

468
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:31,655
-技术非常好的司机  -我知道上那儿找
- A damn good driver. - I know where to find one.

469
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,544
德鲁
Drew.

470
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,071

安德鲁
Andrew.

471
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,250
安德鲁・赫茨伯格
Andrew Herzberg!

472
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:11,328
杰克  真的是你  真不敢相信我的眼睛
Jack? Jack! Really? I can't believe what I'm seeing!

473
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,829
-兄弟  好久不见  -就这家伙吗
- It's been a long time, brother. - - This guy?

474
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,232
这家伙能把卡车开到160英里时速吗
This guy flew in the 160th?

475
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:16,900
一脚上去  直到欧蓝德吉普前脸散架为止
Right up until breaking his commander's jaw.

476
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:21,972
嘘...夜间跟踪者不...
Sh... night stalkers don't--

477
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,880
有必要狂吐一番
that was completely necessary.

478
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,583
我百分百精神了
I feel a hundred percent.

479
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:38,050
-什么风把你吹到泰国来了  -
- What brings you to Thailand? -

480
00:37:38,051 --> 00:37:39,356
我们在密西西比
We're in Mississippi.

481
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:40,890
真的吗
Really?

482
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,893
怎么可能
No fucking way.

483
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:46,429
能拿片纸巾之类的东西给我吗
Can we get a napkin or something?

484
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,732
-就那儿  -赫茨伯格
- Right there. - - Herzberg!

485
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:52,602
原来你在这儿  你这堆狗屎
There you are. You piece of shit!

486
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,671
-你又尿床了  -什么
- You pissed the bed again! - What?

487
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:56,840
你尿床了
Yeah. You pissed the bed!

488
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,674
亲爱的  我知道自己是成年人
Honey, I know I'm really big,

489
00:37:58,675 --> 00:38:00,277
但是  你懂的  这太伤人了
but, you know, it still hurts.

490
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:03,913
你闻闻  你闻闻  闻闻你的尿骚味
Smell it. Smell it! Smell your filthy piss!

491
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:07,717
-好  是我  没错  -哦  是嘛
- All right. Well, it is me. Definitely. - Oh, yeah.

492
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:11,421
闻起来像威士忌  像失败者
Mm! It smells like whiskey, and failure,

493
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:15,692
像不可救药者  所有世界上最坏的东西
and sadness, and everything else bad in the world!

494
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,949
-这家伙一团糟  -
- This guy's a mess. -

495
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,430
比我上次见到他时强多了
He's doing much better than the last time I saw him.

496
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,332
别再问
Don't ask.

497
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:29,806
那么  你意下如何  德鲁
So, what are you thinking, drew?

498
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,076
你说的事情三岁小孩都做得来
I think this baby is capable of what you're asking for.

499
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:36,780
相信我  兄弟  只需稍稍改装几处地方
I'll just need to make a few modifications, but you know me, man.

500
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:38,493
-我就能把它开得飞起来  -
- I can drive, fly, or fuck-- -

501
00:38:38,494 --> 00:38:39,716
你以为  还是你真懂
you think, or you know?

502
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:43,420
-抱歉  -这区别可大着呢
- Excuse me? - Yeah, there's a big difference.

503
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,588
你也许觉得自己是个了不起的司机
You may think you're one hell of a driver,

504
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,790
但我看到的只是个醉熏熏的酒鬼
but I know you're a drunk asshole.

505
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,092
她都不认识我
How could she possibly already know

506
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:51,728
-就敢断定我是个混蛋  -有什么问题
- that I'm an asshole? - What's the problem?

507
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,098
我们计划的成功与否
Our plan lies strictly

508
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,532
跟这个醉鬼司机的驾驶技术密切相关
on whether or not this drunk asshole can drive.

509
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:57,353
-你难道不担心吗  -
- That doesn't concern you? -

510
00:38:57,354 --> 00:38:59,669
仍然没根没据地认定我是个混蛋
Again with the unsubstantiated asshole claim.

511
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,771
不  这我一点也不担心
No. It doesn't concern me.

512
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,260
-我见识过他的开车技术  -
- Because I've seen him drive. -

513
00:39:03,261 --> 00:39:04,641
我也见识过他能醉成什么样子
And I've seen him drunk.

514
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,811
我从不醉酒开车  也许会喝得微醺
I never drive drunk. Buzzed, maybe.

515
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:10,057
宿醉状态开车  那肯定有过
Hung-over, absolutely.

516
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:11,981
但醉酒开车  从未有过
But drunk, never.

517
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,999
哦  那我算松了口气
Oh, that's a relief,

518
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,353
虽然这家伙还是满呕吐物的味道
coming from the guy whose breath still smells like puke.

519
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,788
我去车里等
I'll be in the car.

520
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,726
-她人不错  -天气不错哈
- She's nice. - This is a good day.

521
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:40,192
每次看到你这副硬汉模样
You've any idea

522
00:39:40,193 --> 00:39:42,846
你知道在我眼里有多性感吗
how sexy you are when you do your tough guy routine?

523
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,982
-都布置好了吗  -当然  杰克  都布置妥当了
- Everything set? - Yes, Jack. Everything's set.

524
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:50,887
我喜欢你事事周到
I love how you worry about every single detail

525
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,156
在意每一个细节的样子
right up until the last minute.

526
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:55,492
- Karen... - Mm-hm?
-凯伦... -嗯哼

527
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,060
别
Stop.

528
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,765
我不能
I can't.

529
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,567
-是因为怯懦小姐吗  -她才不怯懦
- Because of Ms. milquetoast? - She's not milquetoast.

530
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,682
得了  杰克
Come on, Jack.

531
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:07,771
这女的就像香草  很普通无聊的
That girl is madame vanilla. Boring.

532
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:10,874
不是普通不普通的问题
It's not about madame vanilla.

533
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:14,711
真的跟简娜没关系  只跟...
It's not about Jenna, it's about...

534
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:17,514
-是我们的问题  是因为你  -嗯哼
- It's about us, it's you. - Mm-hm.

535
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:22,719
我要的  你要的  这一切完全不一样
And what I want, what you want and how that is... Completely different.

536
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:26,623
我不认为你我的需求有多不同
I don't think that what we want is that much different.

537
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,744
还缺个枪手
You don't have a second gunman.

538
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,779
你知道我有多能干
You know that I'm more than capable.

539
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,615
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

540
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,651
-是我的活儿  -不行
- It's my job. - No.

541
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:55,919
我应该在卡车上
I should be on that truck.

542
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:58,755
如果你参与其中  我就撒手不干
If you're on this job, I walk, I'm gone.

543
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,523
那谁去
Then who?

544
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,726
安德鲁有个朋友
Andrew has a guy.

545
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,596
-哦  你相信他么  -我相信
- Oh, and you trust him? - Yeah. I trust Andrew.

546
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:07,831
好
Fine!

547
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,775
价值三千万的钻石在那辆卡车里吗
Thirty million in gems on this truck?

548
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:21,744
对  价值三千万的钻石
That's right, 30 million in gems.

549
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:25,982
-在黑市能卖个二千万吧  -也许不止
- We'll get 20 on the market. - Maybe more.

550
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,785
就算二千万
Let's just count on 20.

551
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:30,086
你欠艾迪八百万
You owe Eddie eight.

552
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:34,991
还剩一千二面万我们五个人分
That leaves roughly 12 for the five of us.

553
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,863
说得没错
That's correct.

554
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:44,834
然后呢
And then what?

555
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:55,144
唔  去圣.约翰岛买个房子
Well, then a house in St. John.

556
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,720
那个枪手  他叫什么名字
Who is it? Our second gunman?

557
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,016
尼古拉斯・西弗
Nicholas sepher.

558
00:42:05,017 --> 00:42:07,790
安德鲁参军的时候就认识他了
Andrew knows him from his time in the army.

559
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:20,837
叫你别那么干  女人  别干
Don't you fucking do it, woman. Don't you do it!

560
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,272
谁让你给你前妻发短信呢
Maybe you should have not texted your ex-wife.

561
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:24,841
她母亲死了  别那么干
Her mother died! Do not fucking do it!

562
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:26,287
-你会下地狱的  -
- You can die in hell. -

563
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:27,877
一天到晚忍受你这唠叨婆
Oh, hell would be fucking paradise

564
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:31,648
我还是去地狱好了  那里才是伊甸园
compared to being married to you!

565
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,016
安德鲁跟我说过那个活儿
Andrew told me about the job.

566
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:34,984
我还没说完呢
We're not done with our talk.

567
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:37,287
兄弟  算上我
I'm in, man.

568
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:39,923
你要去  好啊  真伤透我的心哪
Yeah, you're in, all right, for a whole new world of hurt.

569
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,891
-你还没听细节呢  -不需要也不关心
- You haven't heard the details. - I don't need to. I don't care,

570
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,293
赫茨伯格去就行了
as long as it involves herzberg, it's going to get me

571
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:44,994
至少能让我远离这个家一段时间
the fuck outta this house for a while.

572
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:47,030
我们这个家那里惹你了
And what the hell's so wrong with our house?

573
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,665
-这活危险吗  -当然
- This thing fairly dangerous? - Sure.

574
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:49,966
-杰克  对吧  -对
- It's Jack, right? - Yeah.

575
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:51,901
杰克  我想念过去的生活
Well, Jack, I miss my life.

576
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,738
我还想找个硬汉子呢  总得有人做出牺牲 
I miss getting fucked by a real man. We all make sacrifices.

577
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:01,711
你能闭嘴吗  不然掐死你
I will choke a bitch. Can you shut the fuck up?!

578
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:04,047
等着吃枪子吧
I hope you get shot.

579
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:06,883
杰克  看着我的眼睛  你看我快乐吗
Look in my eyes, Jack. Do I look happy to you?

580
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:09,286
-等着被人一枪打爆你的丁丁
- I hope you get dick shot. -

581
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,887
你看看  每天都这样
It's this. Every day.

582
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,956
一枪爆掉你
The worst kind of shot.

583
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,860
-杰克  你结婚了吗  有孩子  -咦
- You married, Jack? You got kids? - Ish.

584
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:21,230
-啊  兄弟  那感觉糟透了  -尼古拉斯
- Yeah. Well, it sucks, man. - Nicholas.

585
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:24,067
周围的每个人都开开心心的  除了我自己
Because everybody's happy except me. Me?

586
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:26,102
-尼古拉斯  -兄弟  我正想找个理由
- Nicholas! - Oh, man, I'm just looking for a reason

587
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,371
重新操上武器打爆某人的脑袋
to put a gun back in my hand, and a bullet in someone else's brain

588
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,707
在这之前  请告诉我
before I put one in my own. So tell me,

589
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:32,609
我们要对付的家伙  他们够坏吗
are the guys we're going up against, are they bad?

590
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:34,978
-不要脸的大公司  -太妙了
- Faceless corporation. - That's even better.

591
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,946
-尼古拉斯  -什么事
- Nicholas! - What?!

592
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,583
-我有阴虱  会传给你的  -
- I'm going to give you crabs. -

593
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:39,782
够了  把你的东西打包
That's it. Pack your shit.

594
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,785
带上那些猫狗  从我的房子里滚出去
Take those fucking rat dogs and get out of my house!

595
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,821
有一条狗可是你的哦  狗杂种
One of those dogs is yours, cocksucker.

596
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:48,091
我看起来像拉布拉多狗吗
Do I look like I wanted a fucking labradoodle?!

597
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:50,125
它可是我们的宝贝
She's our baby.

598
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:52,362
我要在你的笔记本上撒尿
I'm going to piss on your laptop.

599
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,964
她真会干的  抱歉
She will. Excuse me.

600
00:43:57,669 --> 00:43:59,636
他做得来
He'll do.

601
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,940
前面的守卫  后面的守卫
Guard in the front. Guard in the back.

602
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:05,775
不是系统当天指定的司机
Anyone who tries to drive this thing

603
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:07,243
试图驾驶这卡车的话
other than the driver assigned for that day,

604
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:10,079
生物识别系统会自动让发动机熄火
biometric system automatically kills the engine.

605
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,795
卡车将再也不能启动  明白吗
Can't be restarted. Okay?

606
00:44:11,796 --> 00:44:13,082
我们有20分钟左右的时间
We got 20 minutes or less.

607
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:14,872
最新科技的保险厢体
State-of-the-art vault.

608
00:44:14,873 --> 00:44:16,986
一旦锁上  只能从内部打开
Once it's locked, only gets open from the inside.

609
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:21,024
想暴力切开它  得花上一个小时
It takes us about an hour, an hour to cut through.

610

我阻止卡车

00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,068
-我做掉守卫  -玻璃可是防弹的
- I take out the guard. - The glass is bulletproof.

614
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,970

617
00:44:38,226 --> 00:44:39,976
像我老婆捏爆我的蛋蛋一样简单
like my wife breaks my balls.

618
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:43,246
-罗根  -给队伍提供掩护

622
00:44:53,469 --> 00:44:54,891
对  下次一定记得

就喜欢你这个样子
Just the way I like them.

627
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:08,395
我还没搞懂
I still don't know

628
00:45:08,396 --> 00:45:10,373
你们计划怎么弄开卡车的保险车厢
how you plan on breaking into the truck's vault.

629
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,209
那可是个惊喜哦
Because it's a surprise.

630
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,311
-哦  -我喜欢惊喜
- Oh. - I love surprises.

631

大家都喜欢惊喜  对吧  伙计们
Mm-hm. We all like surprises, right, guys?

632
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:26,456
-罗根  -我不喜欢你  也不相信你
- Logan? - Yeah. Look, I don't like you, I don't fucking trust you.

633

你明天在说好的位置等
You be where you're supposed to be tomorrow.

Car fueled up, ready to go.

635
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:33,463
-我会在那里的  -很好  如果你不听话
- I'll be there. - That's good to hear. Because if you're not,

636
00:45:33,465 --> 00:45:36,733
我会找到你  等着你的孩子出生
I'll find you, wait for that fucking kid to be born,

637
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:40,303
受洗囡包  再给你个哥伦比亚式的死亡
and give you a Colombian necktie as a belated baby shower present.

638
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:44,841
好生动形象  你的意思已转达  没别的事吧
Graphic, but it gets your point across. Are we done?

639
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:46,476
不  话还没说完
No, we're not fucking done.

640

他现在跟简娜的关系好着呢
He's got a great thing going with Jenna.

641
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,079
你别给他添乱
He doesn't need you fucking it up.

642
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,881
难道你不认为
You don't think that he should be

643
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:53,850
他应该跟更好的人在一起嘛
with someone like that any more than he does.

644
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:56,052
换个说法  如果你给他添乱
Let me rephrase. You fuck this up,

645
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:58,788
利用了杰克的话  我会杀了你
you fuck over Jack, and I'll kill you.

646
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,157
你废话真是太多了
Now you're just being redundant.

647
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:45,201
套上去  好朋友  就像过去那样
Get on there, my little friend. Yeah. Like old times.

648

-尼克  准备好  -行动吧
- You ready, Nick? - Let's rock and roll.

650
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,367
怎么回事
What's going on?

651
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,471
靠
Fuck!

652
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,344
嘿  老兄  麻烦低下头
Hey, buddy! You might want to duck!

653
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:47,163
-我去下一个地点  -收到
- I'm going to the next location. - Copy that.

654
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,541

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Let's go. Come back. Back. Hold! Right there.

657
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:28,471
做好准备
Get ready.

658
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:30,206
德鲁  好了  目标到手

Six bad guys.

664
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:22,258

666
00:49:20,408 --> 00:49:22,258
欢迎来到枪弹纷飞的世界
Welcome to the suck.

667
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,331
左  左转
Left! Go left!

668
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:32,969
-右边有辆车跟上来了  -看到了
- We got one on the right. - I got him.

669
00:49:53,024 --> 00:49:55,424
靠  为什么坏家伙总是有自动武器
Shit! Why do the bad guys always have automatic weapons?

670
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:58,227
不好说  我正进入状态呢
I don't know, but I'm getting hard!

671
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:12,141

杰克  看我的
There you go, Jackie boy!

673
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,756
见鬼

00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:35,364
打中了吗  杰克
You got him, Jackie boy!

675
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:46,442
靠近点
Get me closer.

676
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:11,500

-再近点  -人呢  怎么看不到
- Closer! - Where are they? I can't see them.

677
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:12,735
好  向前开
All right. Drive.

678
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:21,177
糟  看不到人
Shit, I don't see them!

679
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:23,479
走  走  左边  左边
Go! Go! On the left! On the left!

680
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:26,816
哇
Whoa!

681
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:33,556
那儿  就那儿
There. Right there!

682
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:02,351
天啦
Oh, god!

683
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:06,122
靠
Ah! Fuck!

684
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:12,328
糟不  刹车
Oh, shit! Brake!

685
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,408
-哇噢  -哇
- Oh! Yeah! - Whoo!

686
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,444
干得好
That a boy!

687
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:40,256
杰克  在这儿挤满警察之前
Jackie boy! We got about 15 minutes

688
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:42,424
-我们有15分钟  -两分钟就够了
- before this place is swarming with cops. - I just need two.

689
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:43,759
要不要给你电弧热喷枪
You want me to get you a thermal Lance?

690
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,195
不需要进到里面去
I don't need to get in.

691
00:52:46,197 --> 00:52:47,796
把他赶出来就行了
I just need this guy to want out.

692
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:56,705
别搞了
Stop it!

693
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:06,815
手放背后  肚子朝下  肚子朝下趴地上
Hands behind your back! On your stomach! On your stomach!

694
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:09,418
手放背后  趴下
Hands behind your back! Down!

695
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,295
我了个去  好棒
Holy dingle berries!

696
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:21,530
-这值一大笔钱啊  -凯伦说的没错
- That's a lot of coin. - Just like Karen said.

697
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:26,702
凯伦说的没错
Yeah. Just like Karen said.

698
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,537
好了  快离开这里
All right. Let's get out of here.

699
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:45,788
-杰克  快撤  -好
- Come on, Jack. Let's rock and roll. - Yeah.

700
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:46,415
老板大人  我们去那儿
Where you going, boss man?

701
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:49,051
我有点事要查查  应该没啥
I just want to check something out. It's probably nothing.

702
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:52,354
你们先走吧  我...我会赶上来的
Just keep going, I'll... I'll catch up with you.

703
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:13,809
你可太心灵手巧了  真是奇迹
You were always a miracle worker with your hands.

704
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:16,612
换作我五分钟内肯定解不开
It would have taken me at least five minutes. Hey!

705
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:19,682
请不要乱动
Just stop right there.

706
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:22,451
-艾迪  现在怎么说  -怎么说吗
- So, what happens now, Eddie? - What happens now?

707
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,133
把那个小小的黑盒子乖乖地双手奉上
You're going to give me that little black box,

708
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:24,787
这就是我的说法
that's what happens now.

709
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:28,724
-然后呢  -然后嘛  可以放你一条生路
- Then what? - And then what? Then you get to live.

710
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:33,662
-艾迪  -什么
- Eddie! - What?

711
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,698
放她走
Let her go.

712
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:40,536
大英雄  把枪放下
Put the gun down, hero.

713
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:42,771
把枪放地上  踢过来给我
Put the gun down and kick it over here towards me.

714
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,620
-杰克  别那么干  -
- Don't do it, Jack. -

715
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:46,775
没人问你的意见  闭上你的嘴
Nobody asked you your opinion, so shut the fuck up!

716
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:47,867
大英雄  别担心
Don't worry, hero.

717
00:55:47,868 --> 00:55:49,912
对你来说  她也许甜美体贴
With you, she might have liked it all sweet and gentle,

718
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:52,681
但对我而言  她更喜欢被粗暴对待
but with me, she liked it a little bit rougher.

719
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,818
对不对  亲爱的
Mm. Isn't that right, sweetheart?

720
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,921
把枪踢过来
Kick it over here to me!

721
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:07,963
你给他承诺了什么  承诺了什么
What did you promise him. Huh? What did you promised him?

722
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:12,701
钱  性  还是别的
Money? Sex? What?

723
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:18,006
不对
No.

724
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:23,145
他不知情  对不
He doesn't know? No.

725
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:26,749
你个贱人
You bitch.

726
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:30,753
我给你看样东西  看样东西
Let me show you something. Let me show you something.

727
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:36,425
-艾迪  -这就是你关心的吗
- Eddie. Eddie... - This? Is that what you're talking about?

728
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:38,660
艾迪  求你了  别
Eddie, please, no.

729
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:41,063
艾迪  艾迪
Eddie. Eddie!

730
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,131
跟肚子里的小宝贝说再见吧
Say bye-bye to the baby.

731
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:43,465
艾迪  别开枪
Don't do it, Eddie.

732
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:45,868
不要
No!

733
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,739
哦  不  怎么没小孩
Oh, no! No baby!

734
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:54,810
哦  不  居然没人受伤
Oh, no. No one's hurt.

735
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,747
开罗群岛那个活儿
So you did make it out

736
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,816
你还是做成了嘛  滚过去吧
of the Caymans with something. Get over there.

737
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:03,552
我猜她只是利用你搞到我手中的这个玩意
Guess she needed you to screw me out of this.

738
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:07,823
杰克  我已就位  但无法准确射击
Jack, I'm in position, but I can't get a clean shot.

739
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:12,694
-三... -真可惜
- Three... - - Shame really.

740
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:14,029
假如情况不同
If things were different,

741
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:16,098
你我合作能赚大钱
we could have made a lot of dough, you and me.

742
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:21,069
-二... -杰克  真是太可惜了
- Two... - Well, it's a real shame, Jack.

743
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:24,640
一  听你号令
One. On your go.

744
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:26,775
有时候事情就是办不成
Sometimes things just don't work out.

745
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,546
趴下
Down now!

746
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,754
-杰克  -快走
- Jack! - Let's go!

747
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,674
快撤
Let's roll!

748
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:03,579
-对  撤吧  -罗根  该撤了
- Yeah, let's go! - Logan, let's go.

749
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:34,009
-啊  -罗根  快来
- Ah! - Come on, Logan. Let's go.

750
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:05,641
她失血过多  应该送她去真正的医院
She's lost a lot of blood. You guys should take her to a real hospital.

751
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:07,743
这不行
We can't.

752
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,179
简娜  感激不尽
Jenna, I can't thank you enough.

753
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:14,249
你务必星期一之前离开这儿
Just be out of here by Monday.

754
00:59:15,286 --> 00:59:18,720
杰克  别再给我电话
And Jack, don't ever call me again.

755
00:59:31,702 --> 00:59:34,903
杰克会对凯伦发多大的火呀
I wouldn't want to be Karen right about now.

756
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,772
女人嘛
Women.

757
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,579
值得吗
Was it worth it?

758
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:46,682
嗯
Hm?

759
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:53,255
我在问你呢  值得吗
I asked you a question. Was it worth it?

760
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,479
-杰克  今天的一切都不在我的计划之内
- None of this was my plan, Jack. -

761
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,692
那你的计划是什么  凯伦
What was the plan, Karen?

762
00:59:56,694 --> 00:59:58,413
-把我杀掉吗  -
- Was I supposed to get killed? -

763
00:59:58,414 --> 01:00:00,896
不  按计划你会得到三千万
No. You were supposed to get 30 million.

764
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:02,931
那假怀孕是怎么回事
What about the fake pregnancy?

765
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:06,101
-我得确定  -确定什么  什么
- I had to make sure. - For what? For what?!

766
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:09,605
为了这玩意  这玩意吗
For this? Hm? This?

767
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,040
这个小玩意  它作什么用的
This little thing? What is this?

768
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,676
-钥匙  -解锁什么
- A key. - To what?

769
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,379
上帝帮我  凯伦
God help me, Karen!

770
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:20,182
你现在可没有肚子里的婴儿作倚仗
You don't have the baby inside to protect you.

771
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,918
一个保险柜
A safe.

772
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:29,291
另一个活儿吗
This is for another job?

773
01:00:33,263 --> 01:00:36,064
保险柜里的货价值多少
And how much is in this safe?

774
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:38,100
唔  肯定不止三千万
Hm? It has to be a lot more than 30 million.

775
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:39,401
五千万  七千五百万吗
We're talking 50? 75?

776
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:42,037
-五亿  -我操  你就扯吧
- Half a billion. - Oh, fuck! Bullshit.

777
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,672
红钻
Red diamonds.

778
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:45,841
CIA黑色行动缴获的
CIA black op.

779
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:48,944
五百万一克拉  一百克拉价值五亿
Five million a carat, 100 carats, 500 million.

780
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:50,746
载着保险柜的飞机将于明天抵达
The plane with the safe flies in tomorrow,

781
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:53,148
加个油  然后飞走
just long enough to refuel, and then it's gone.

782
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,118
懂了  我懂了  那我们怎么下手
Oh, I see. I see. And what were you going to do?

783
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,420
走进去直接拿钻石吗
Just walk in there and take them?

784
01:00:58,422 --> 01:01:01,056
计划中本来应该没人受伤的
No one was supposed to get hurt.

785
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:03,659
罗根受伤了
Logan did.

786
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:05,994
可以看出  你根本不在乎
Yeah, I see, not that you fucking care!

787
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,227
整个团队被盯上
I just earmarked my entire team.

788
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:09,998
进了死亡名单  艾迪会一直追杀我们
We have a death mark on us. Eddie's going to hunt us down.

789
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,835
-都是拜你所赐  -我真不是有意的
- So thank you very much! - I never meant for this to happen!

790
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:23,378
你手包里的超声波图是怎么回事
What about that sonogram I found in your purse?

791
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:29,418
那是真的  但孩子没能留住
It was real. But I lost the baby.

792
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,888
是我的吗
Was it mine?

793
01:01:45,903 --> 01:01:48,103
去偷钻石吧  好好生活
Go get your diamonds. Have a nice life.

794
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:52,441
带着那五亿  有多远滚多远
With half a billion, you can afford to stay the fuck out of mine.

795
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,537
罗根  我真不想说
Come on, Logan. I could really use

796
01:02:28,538 --> 01:02:32,314
"我早告诉你会这样"之类的话
that "i told you so" look right about now.

797
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:55,437
-我觉得你应该吻她的前额  -你说什么
- I think you should kiss her on the forehead. - What?

798
01:02:55,439 --> 01:03:00,208
我是说  你该亲她一下之类的
I don't know. I mean, I feel like you should kiss her or something, you know?

799
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,979
-伙计  你这是  -让她有被爱的感觉
- Dude, have you-- - make her feel like she's loved.

800
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:05,914
她不信那套骗人的玩意
She's not into that sappy shit.

801
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:08,917
真的吗  老天  她都昏迷不醒了
Really? Jesus, she's sleeping.

802
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:09,918
还能拿你怎样
I mean, what is she going to do?

803
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,254
打爆你的脸  这就是她想干的
She'll break your fucking face. That's what she'll do.

804
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:19,227
嘿  欢迎回到人间  感觉如何
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Welcome back. How you feeling?

805
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:21,296
像在鬼门关走了一遭
Like I went dancing with a claymore.

806
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:24,132
噢  宝贝  宝贝
Oh, baby! Oh, baby!

807
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,596
-你怎么上这儿来了  宝贝  -
- What are you doing here, babe? -

808
01:03:26,597 --> 01:03:28,136
真对不起  是...
I'm sorry. Is it...?

809
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,273
没事  宝贝  只是伤到了腿
No, no, baby. It's just my leg. Mm! It's just my leg.

810
01:03:31,275 --> 01:03:33,475
感谢上帝  我上次不该说那些话的
Thank god! I didn't mean what I said.

811
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:35,277
我知道  我知道你是爱我的丁丁
I know. I know you love my dick.

812
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:38,413
-对不起  我... -这是你带来的吗
- I'm sorry. It's... - What did you bring me?

813
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:42,250
噢  杰克  我在门口发现了这东西
Oh. Jack, this was on the front doorstep for you.

814
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:47,088
-是什么来着  -某种遥控器和一个手机
- What is it? - Some kind of remote and a cell phone.

815
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:58,867
杰克
Jack.

816
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:03,138
你怎么走得这么急  好想念你这个好朋友
My new best friend jerk off. You left in such a hurry.

817
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,973
艾迪  什么事
What can I do for you, Eddie?

818
01:04:04,975 --> 01:04:07,609
看来凯伦也不是那么冷血嘛
Turns out Karen isn't the cold-hearted bitch

819
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:11,146
她今天来了我的酒店
we made her out to be. She stopped by my hotel

820
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:13,982
带着你手里正拿着的那玩意  赔礼道歉
with what you now hold in your hands. Tried to make amends.

821
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:16,184
试图说服我这一切都是她的错
Tried to tell me that it was all her fault,

822
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:20,255
求我不要找你和你那帮反社会分子的麻烦
to leave you and your merry band of misfit hoods out of this.

823
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:24,002
-给你电话  亲爱的  打个招呼吧  -
- Here. Say hi, sweetheart. -

824
01:04:24,003 --> 01:04:25,126
杰克  快逃
Just run, Jack.

825
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:28,530
说得对  杰克  快逃  有多快跑多快
That's right, Jack. Run. Run as fast as you can.

826
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:31,633
也许我不会让我手下追你
I probably won't use my considerable resources to find you

827
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:35,503
-并灭了你  -这种威胁我听得多了
- and put you down. - It's not the first time I've been threatened.

828
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:39,374
没人威胁你  只是想跟你谈个交易
Nobody's threatening you yet. I'm offering you a trade.

829
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:42,010
你以为我在乎啊  让她烂在地狱里吧
She can rot in hell, for all I care.

830
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:44,279
你这话我不得不承认  可能属实
That's probably an undeniable fact.

831
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:47,349
但这取决于你  是让她明天就开始腐烂发臭
But it's up to you whether she starts her stint tomorrow,

832
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:50,051
还是50年之后  杰克  你说呢
or 50 years from now. Come on, Jack.

833
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:55,090
我在给你实实在在的机会哦  看你怎么打动我了
I'm giving you a real opportunity here. Impress me.

834
01:04:57,628 --> 01:05:00,395
大伙儿能给我俩几分钟吗
Can you guys give us a minute?

835
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:04,499
我能看出你为什么喜欢他
I can see why you like him.

836
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,268
艾迪  他不会帮你做这事的
He's not going to do the job, Eddie.

837
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,403
等着瞧
We'll see.

838
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:12,641
上帝啊  互相信任就这么难吗
Jesus. That must have been hard.

839
01:05:12,643 --> 01:05:15,043
不懂你的意思
I don't follow.

840
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:19,314
靠  要她相信别人这么难
It must have been hard for her. Fuck.

841
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:23,585
我本不想说的  她把这一切搞砸了
I hate to be the one saying this. She fucked up.

842
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,487
很彻底
Big time.

843
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:28,223
但她至少敢挺身而出
But she at least tried to do the stand-up thing

844
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:29,925
向艾迪独揽罪过
and come clean to Eddie.

845
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:32,394
她还是想收拾烂摊子的
She tried to wipe our slates clean.

846
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:34,930
做这些需要勇气  她可以选择不做的
That took guts. She didn't have to do that.

847
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:40,335
不对  她自己闯下的祸  得由她自己解决
No. She got herself into this mess. She can get herself out.

848
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:42,671
-做件混账事  -什么
- Be a douche-bag. - What?

849
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:46,241
-做件混账事  -你说啥
- Be a douche-bag. - What?

850
01:05:50,308 --> 01:05:52,447
杰克  你还是成不了那种人
Jack, you're not a douche-bag.

851
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,452
从你救我的那天起  我就意识到这一点
I knew that the moment you saved my life.

852
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,454
你不肯放弃我
You could have let me down.

853
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:03,258
你也不会放弃凯伦  有没有孩子都一样
You can't let Karen down, baby or no baby.

854
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,295
不  不  不  不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

855
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:09,513
这次不行  明白嘛
Not this time. Okay?

856
01:06:09,514 --> 01:06:12,334
你睡在床上休息  等事情过去
You're going to sit this one out.

857
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,473
什么活儿
What's the job?

858
01:06:21,712 --> 01:06:24,980
钻石  价值五亿
Half a bil, in diamonds.

859
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:30,719
为什么就不能只是抢个本地的珠宝店呢
Why can't it ever just be a local jewelry store?

860
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:46,468
那是摩根机场  俗称"落脚点"
That's Morgan airfield, the proverbial stomping ground

861
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:49,337
这机场是给所有机密任务  黑色行动用的
for all things clandestine and black ops.

862
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:53,341
飞机将于17小时内抵达  降落并加满油
Our plane lands in 17 hours. Touches down for a refuel only,

863
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,410
我们有15分钟的时间
giving us a window of 15 whole minutes.

864
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:58,146
我们需要做的是  在这段时间内
And all we gotta do in that time is walk in,

865
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:00,215
闯进飞机  打开保险柜
board the plane, crack the safe,

866
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:03,451
获取目标  然后大伙儿一起把东西带出来
download the score, and get the flock out of there.

867
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:05,620
你说得很具体  看起来很有把握
You say it like that, it almost sounds doable.

868
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:08,356
就说我们到了机场附近
Say we even get onto this airfield here,

869
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,525
知道机场地面有多少守卫要对付吗
do we know how many guards we're going to be dealing with on the ground?

870
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,128
不知道  只能走一步看一步
No. We'll have to figure that out in real time.

871
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:16,464
我是说  是50个还是100个守卫
I mean, but are we talking like 50 guards, or are we talking like 100 guards?

872
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:17,005
首先
First things first.

873
01:07:17,006 --> 01:07:19,434
我们得想办法在不中弹的情况下靠近机场
We gotta get onto that airfield without getting shot.

874
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:23,304
我在做事呢  你说怎么办吧
I'm working. Okay? How are we going to do that?

875
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,309
-马尼拉  -马尼拉
- Manila? - Manila?

876
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:30,003
-那次好像没成功吧  -
- Didn't work out too good for you there. -

877
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,413
也许这次能大炫魅力呢
Maybe second time's the charm.

878
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:32,514
究竟谁是马尼拉
Who the hell is Manila?

879
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:35,517
-她真可爱啊  -呵
- She's adorable. - Yeah.

880
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:39,187
好了  德鲁  让他们忙乎吧  我去准备
All right, drew. Keep them busy while I get to work.

881
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:45,727
-你看那个小丑  -想吃点冰淇淋吗
- Check out this clown. - Want some ice cream?

882
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:48,329
搞什么飞机
What the fuck?

883
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:58,506
杰克  大门安全了  你可以行动了
The gate's clear, Jack. You're good to go.

884
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:01,176
阿普萨拉  记住  按尼克说的做
Apsara, remember, just like Nick showed you.

885
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:05,547
瞄准卡车  开枪就行
Aim for the truck and just pull the trigger.

886
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:07,682
别开枪  别开枪
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

887
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:17,725
谁想舔一舔  过来啊  冰淇淋大甩卖
Anyone want a lick? Come get your ice cream! Come!

888
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:22,363
你穿着什么呢  这帮狗娘养的最好跑快点
What are you wearing? Fuckers better run.

889
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:31,372
快  快  快
Move, move, move!

890
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:01,536
好了  要给力啊  宝贝
All right, come on, baby.

891
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,515
见鬼
Shit!

892
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:18,286
-杰克  杰克  -再说一遍
- Jack! Jack! - Say again?

893
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:21,322
你得离开  快
You gotta go. Move!

894
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,360
我还在想你会不会出现呢
I was wondering if you were going to show up.

895
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:28,596
那里出差错了  艾迪认为我做不来吗
What's wrong? Eddie doesn't think I can do the job?

896
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:29,908
不如说是他不敢确定
Let's just say he wasn't sure

897
01:09:29,909 --> 01:09:31,933
凯伦在你心目中是否比五个亿更占份量
Karen was worth the half a billion.

898
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:36,304
别把垃圾当宝贝
One man's trash and all.

899
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:38,439
你害我等了好久
What's taking so long?

900
01:09:39,543 --> 01:09:41,910
你行  你上啊
You think you can go faster, be my guest.

901
01:09:56,459 --> 01:10:00,528
-有主意吗  -有
- Got any ideas? - Yeah.

902
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,197
一个
One.

903
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,769
啊
Ahh!

904
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:48,843
-你欠我一次休假  -好说
- You owe me a vacation! - Fine.

905
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:51,412
二次休假
Two vacations.

906
01:11:13,737 --> 01:11:15,586
杰克  你太让我失望了
Jack. You are a disappointment to me.

907
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:17,772
凯伦还有脸说你是最棒的
Karen said you were the best.

908
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:20,708
引用她的原话"米开朗基罗般的窃贼"
"The Michelangelo of thieves," to be exact.

909
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:22,377
我想最近可能有点生疏了
I may be getting a little rusty.

910
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:23,711
没事  反正你也活不了多久
It's all right. Soon you'll be dead.

911
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:26,748
先让我一枪爆了凯伦的脸再说
Right after I shoot Karen in the face.

912
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,917
说得好精彩  但你还是先耐心等等吧
Well, that's graphic. But you might want to just wait on that.

913
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:31,653
你的耐心可能值五亿美元哦
Could be worth half a billion dollars.

914
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:33,788
要我提醒嘛  钻石可在我手上
In case you missed it, I have the diamonds.

915
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,324
只要飞机一着陆
If the situation were reversed,

916
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:38,660
你就插不上手了
even I couldn't get them back once they land.

917
01:11:38,662 --> 01:11:40,328
那是因为你不是米开朗基罗
That's because you're not Michelangelo.

918
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,797
艾迪  知道嘛  这些随机密钥生成器
You see, Eddie, the problem with those keygens,

919
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,899
很高明的玩意  要破解它
as remarkable as they are, they take forever.

920
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:47,035
15分钟的加油时间远远不够
Way more than the 15 minutes I had for refueling,

921
01:11:47,037 --> 01:11:49,470
但你知道怎样做更快吗
but you know what goes real fast?

922
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:50,605
塞姆汀炸药
Semtex.

923
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:24,672
牛仔  你的话我在听
Okay, cowboy. You have my attention.

924
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:25,742
-带上钻石到...
- Bring the diamonds to-- -

925
01:12:25,743 --> 01:12:27,642
-别讨价还价  我会通知你地址
negative. I'll call you with a location.

926
01:12:27,644 --> 01:12:30,511
看来你忘了我手里有你的女人
You seem to forget that I have the girl.

927
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:33,481
你也忘了  在我眼里她就是个婊子
And you seem to forget she can be a real bitch.

928
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:37,552
值不了五个亿
It might not be worth a half a billion dollars to me.

929
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:40,988
杰克  好吧  按你说的来
Okay, Jack. Have it your way.

930
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:10,718
这女人真值得你在乎嘛
Your boy's got some sand.

931
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:16,724
-你怎么还没死  -心死而已
- You're not dead yet? - Only on the inside.

932
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:24,031
-杰克  对不起  -好感人的重聚
- I'm sorry, Jack. - Cozy little reunion.

933
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:26,067
打开它
Open it up.

934
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:29,704
我可做不到  密钥生成器丢了
Yeah, I can't. Keygen's gone. I lost it in the fall,

935
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:33,441
你这般神通广大的人  肯定会想到办法的
but a man with your resources, I'm sure you can figure a way into it

936
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:36,043
把它搬回你那受隐私保护的家  或是总部 
in the privacy of your own home, or lair,

937
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:38,880
or whatever assholes like you have.
找个混蛋帮你打开吧

938
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:43,718
杰克  还有个小问题  我得杀了你
Oh, Jack. There's still the little matter of me killing you.

939
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:47,455
我们有约在先
We had a deal.

940
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:49,710
我从不跟偷我东西的贼做交易
I don't make deals with people that steal from me.

941
01:13:49,711 --> 01:13:51,159
对生意影响太坏了
It's not good for business.

942
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:53,995
-我有狙击手  -狙击手完蛋了
- My sniper. - Your sniper's fucked.

943
01:13:53,997 --> 01:13:55,355
什么都听不到吧
Can't hear anything.

944
01:13:55,356 --> 01:13:57,732
我干扰了这里的所有通讯信号
I'm jamming all signals transmitting out of here.

945
01:13:57,734 --> 01:14:01,869
想走出这个地方  门都没有
And I hope you don't think for one second I'm going to step out from under this thing.

946
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:03,438
不对
Nope.

947
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,674
趴下
Get down!

948
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:11,512
带他出去  快走
Get him out of here! Go! Come on!

949
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:15,082
他们朝楼顶方向跑了
They're headed for the roof.

950
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:18,653
凯伦  跟上
Karen, move!

951
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,831
警局  需要我帮你转接吗
911, how can I direct your call?

952
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:32,066
刚听到一声爆炸  声音非常大  我觉得
We just heard a bomb, really big, and I think...

953
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:34,902
老天  一大帮人带着枪冲进了酒店
Oh, my god! There's a whole bunch of men with guns in my hotel.

954
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:39,707
女士  警车正赶向案发地点  请安心等待
Okay, ma'am. We have vehicles responding right now. Just sit tight.

955
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:12,540
警局  需要我帮你转接吗
911, how can I direct your call?

956
01:15:12,542 --> 01:15:15,009
好  警车正赶往案发地点
Yeah, we have vehicles responding to you right now.

957
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:27,622
上  上  上  上  上  上
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

958
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:35,997
上  上  上
Go! Go! Go!

959
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,571
-去楼顶  -杰克  真不要我帮忙吗
- Get to the roof. - You sure don't need me, Jack?

960
01:15:43,573 --> 01:15:46,204
-当然  我一个人就行  -
- I'm sure I don't need you. -

961
01:15:46,205 --> 01:15:47,708
杰克  你需要我
You need me, Jack.

962
01:15:56,986 --> 01:16:00,655
糟糕
Ah! Shit!

963
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:04,759
杰克  没子弹了吗
Out of ammo, Jack? Huh?

964
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:09,864
紧张么
Getting nervous?

965
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:27,281
操你妈的
Fuck you!

966
01:16:33,957 --> 01:16:37,858
-杰克  过来啊  狗杂种
- Get over there, Jack! Fucker!

967
01:16:48,338 --> 01:16:49,870
我搞得定
I had him!

968
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:54,308
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

969
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:57,612
你个...
Son of a...

970
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,921
-多谢帮忙  -杰克  你又欠我一次休假
- Thanks for the help. - You owe me three vacations, Jack.

971
01:17:06,923 --> 01:17:09,657
看来你的休假已经开始了
Looks like you're starting now.

972
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:24,872
兄弟  快点  要走啦  快
Move! Let's go, man! Come on!

973
01:17:25,742 --> 01:17:27,908
站住
Stop!

974
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:31,946
站住  这一切
Stop! All of this,

975
01:17:31,948 --> 01:17:33,994
就是为了爬上楼顶被乱枪扫死
just to get shot up here on this roof.

976
01:17:33,995 --> 01:17:34,949
这就是你的计划吗
That's your plan?

977
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:37,385
去你的
Ish.

978
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,763
-嘣  -吃老娘一枪  混蛋
- Bang! - Eat a dick, asshole.

979
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:11,686
走吧
Come on!

980
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:35,476
飞机会带你去迈阿密  之后你想去那都行
This will take you to Miami and then... wherever you need to go.

981
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:37,812
杰克  你总能事事想周到
You always take care of everything, Jack.

982
01:18:37,814 --> 01:18:40,347
你的分成
Your cut.

983
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:43,317
有点轻哦
Seems a little light.

984
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:46,287
如果你愿意的话  可以跟罗根谈谈
You can take it up with Logan if you'd like.

985
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:48,989
不了
No, I'll manage.

986
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:52,827
-凯伦  再见  -杰克...
- Goodbye, Karen. - Jack...

987
01:18:52,829 --> 01:18:55,496
-承认吧  -承认什么
- Admit it. - Admit what?

988
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:57,736
你思念我  你思念这种感觉
You missed me. You missed this.

989
01:18:57,737 --> 01:19:00,935
长久以来只有这种感觉才让你重新鲜活起来
This is the most alive you've felt in a long time.

990
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:08,476
-承认吧  -承认什么
- Admit it. - Admit what?

991
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:13,781
你自投罗网就是为了利用我们偷钻石和杀艾迪
You turned yourself in so we would have to steal the diamonds and kill Eddie.

992
01:19:16,052 --> 01:19:21,422
我说过的  杰克  你总是事事想得周到
Like I said, you always take care of everything, Jack.

993
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:46,413
凯伦  再见
Goodbye, Karen.

994
01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:56,991
再见  杰克
Bye, Jack.

995
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:45,172
喔  吼  吼  吼
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

996
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:48,342
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

997
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:52,112
真不敢相信你就这样白白给她奉上五百万美金
I can't believe you just handed her five million dollars.

998
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:54,582
-是她该得的  -才不是
- She earned it. - Like hell she did.

999
01:20:54,584 --> 01:20:57,518
就当是你射伤她的补偿吧
Consider it a severance package for you shooting her.

1000
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,127
-那是个意外
- That was an accident.

1001
01:20:59,128 --> 01:21:03,490
-"基本射击要领  枪目线过于模糊"
- "Marksmanship 101, boss. Gun target line was shit."

1002
01:21:04,594 --> 01:21:07,228
你知道人们怎么形容站街女吗
You know what they say about hookers.

1003
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:13,601
杰克  我不知道人们怎么说的  解释一下
No, Jack. I don't know what they say about hookers. Enlighten me.

1004
01:21:13,603 --> 01:21:14,994
你付钱不是为了做爱
You don't pay them for sex.

1005
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:17,271
而是为了让她们离开  这叫花钱买平安
You pay them to leave.

1006
01:21:17,273 --> 01:21:21,375
老板  很合理  就是为了晚上睡个安稳觉嘛
Justify it however you need to in order to sleep at night, boss.

1007
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,645
-也可以说我是软心肠  -我说你是个蠢蛋
- Call me a softy. - I'll call you an idiot.

1008
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:29,884
罗根  把今天这番话当做绝妙友谊的开端吧
Logan, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

1009
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:32,353
真的吗  我觉得更像是某件事的结局
Really? I see it more as an ending.

1010
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:53,374
-罗根好吗  -她很好  谢谢
- How's Logan? - She's good. Thanks.

1011
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:58,545
-这小狗是谁的  -我的
- And whose puppy is this? - It's mine.

1012
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:03,517
对了  我...有书面证明
Uh, yeah, I... have proof.

1013
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:06,353
我料到你会问起的  它叫罗伊
I figured you'd ask. His name is Roy.

1014
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:07,625
-杰克  我... -
- Jack, I... -

1015
01:22:07,626 --> 01:22:09,590
简娜  听我说  请再给我一次机会
Look, Jenna, I was hoping for a second chance.

1016
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:12,313
-我明白也许不值得你... -
- I know I don't deserve one-- - deserve?

1017
01:22:12,314 --> 01:22:14,128
值得  你是说值得吗
You want to talk about deserve?

1018
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:17,264
杰克  我是不喜欢凯伦  但那也不应当成为
Jack, I know I don't look like Karen, but that doesn't mean I deserve

1019
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,199
你那样对待我的理由
to be treated the way you treated me.

1020
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:22,236
骗了我好几个星期  我都差点因你而死
You lied to me for weeks. You almost got me killed.

1021
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:25,205
-我... -让我把话说完
- I... - Just let me finish.

1022
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:27,374
是的  我非常喜欢你
Okay, I liked you, a lot.

1023
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:32,246
你嘴甜  体贴  风趣  聪明  有绅士风度
You were sweet, caring, gentle, funny, smart.

1024
01:22:32,248 --> 01:22:34,315
在我眼里你还是拥有这些品质的
And then you were still all of those things,

1025
01:22:34,317 --> 01:22:37,551
但同时也是爱惹事生非的大坏蛋
but also this incredible bad-ass.

1026
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:41,221
这点其实非常性感
Which was actually really sexy.

1027
01:22:41,223 --> 01:22:44,391
假如你想再次约我出去
But if you want to ask me out again, you're going to have to do more

1028
01:22:44,393 --> 01:22:47,061
买一条小狗  送些鲜花是远远不够的
than just buy a puppy and show up with flowers.

1029
01:22:47,063 --> 01:22:48,529
简娜  我...我不是...
Jenna, I... I don't--

1030
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:50,297
好  要不以这个做为开始吧
okay, how about this for starters.

1031
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,366
带上你的小狗
You come to my office in a few weeks,

1032
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:55,402
过星期来办公室找我
with your new puppy, and if bad men haven't shown up

1033
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:57,324
如果那时没有带着枪的坏人
with guns to kill the poor little innocent puppy

1034
01:22:57,325 --> 01:22:59,406
找上门来杀掉可怜无辜的小狗
by then,

1035
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,468
也许你有机会约我共进晚餐
then maybe we have a chance at having a dinner date

1036
01:23:01,469 --> 01:23:04,411
枪林弹雨  摩托艇追逐是绝对不允许的
without bullets and boat chases.

1037
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:07,982
-成交么  -成交
- Deal? - Deal.

1038
01:23:07,984 --> 01:23:11,452
然后
And then, after an indefinite number of dinner dates,

1039
01:23:11,454 --> 01:23:15,289
假设没有大肚子的前女友找上门来
assuming that no pregnant ex-girlfriends show up,

1040
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:17,157
没有人再追杀我们
and no one shoots at us,

1041
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:21,328
我也没找到你撒谎的蛛丝马迹
and if I don't catch you in any more lies,

1042
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:23,564
在共度无数个晚餐约会的夜晚之后
you can somehow manage all of that,

1043
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:27,501
可能  仅仅是可能
then maybe, just maybe,

1044
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:31,372
我会给你个开着灯做爱的理由
I'll give you a reason to fuck with the lights on.

1045
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:40,381
就说她会喜欢你的
Told you she'd like you. Yeah.

1046
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:44,752
哦  杰克  "要不一起共进晚餐"总比
Well, "how about we go to dinner" is better than,

1047
01:23:44,754 --> 01:23:49,423
"去你妈的  我要叫警察了"  强多了
"go fuck yourself, Jack, I'm calling the cops."

1048
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:03,370
-喂  -我不确定你会接电话
- Hello? - I didn't know if you'd pick up.

1049
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:05,272
真不知道是你打来的
I didn't know it was you.

1050
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:09,343
是我自做自受
I deserve that.

1051
01:24:09,345 --> 01:24:11,045
凯伦  你要说什么
What do you want, Karen?

1052
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:13,080
我在圣.约翰岛买了幢房子
I bought that house on St. John.

1053
01:24:13,082 --> 01:24:15,082
很美  靠近水边
It's beautiful. It's on the water,

1054
01:24:15,084 --> 01:24:16,517
就像我们说过的那样
just like we talked about.

1055
01:24:16,519 --> 01:24:19,353
我甚至打算买一间潜水店
I'm even looking into buying a dive shop.

1056

我为你感到开心  真的  但我不...
I'm happy for you, I really am, but I don't see...

1057
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:25,426
见鬼  杰克  我真的不擅长道歉
Goddamn it! I'm no good at apologizing, Jack.

1058
01:24:25,428 --> 01:24:28,362
我从没就任何事给任何人道过歉
I've never apologized to anyone for anything.

1059
01:24:28,364 --> 01:24:31,498
我的意思是  我应该道歉的  只是...
Well, I mean, I was supposed to, I just...

1060
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:35,169
只是说不出口
I just didn't.

1061
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:38,405
杰克  事情过去之后  我变了很多
Jack, something changed me all through all this, you know,

1062
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:41,542
看到我给你带来的伤害  我...
seeing the pain that I caused you, I...

1063
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,546
我想跟你在一起
I want to be with you.

1064
01:24:45,548 --> 01:24:49,416
这房子  这些钱  没了你就...
This house, the money, without you it's...

1065
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:52,219
...就真心无聊啊
...it's boring.

1066
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:54,126
杰克  你知道怎么样才不无聊嘛
But you know what's not boring,

1067
01:24:54,127 --> 01:24:56,390
怎样才能永远不无聊吗  你我呆在一起
you know what's never boring, Jack? Us.

1068
01:24:56,392 --> 01:25:00,661
-你太孤独了  凯伦  找  -我爱你
- You're lonely, Karen. Find-- - I love you.

Jack, I love you. I think I've always loved you.

我知道你也是爱我的  我们可以再复合
And I know you love me. We could make this work.

1071
01:25:08,838 --> 01:25:11,538
我们会幸福的
We could be happy.

1072
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:15,409
会幸福的
We can be happy.

1073
01:25:15,411 --> 01:25:17,711
杰克
Jack.

1074
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:20,147
杰克
Jack?

1075
01:25:21,217 --> 01:25:22,583
杰克
Jack?

1076
01:25:27,389 --> 01:25:30,691
