{\an7\fs16}Based on novel by MATSUMOTO Seicho

{\fs40}Crossing Mt. Amagi

3
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:14,666
Numazu, Shizuoka Prefecture

4
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:20,966
December 1953

5
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:39,887
The handbills are done.

6
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:40,988
Thanks.

7
00:00:58,106 --> 00:00:59,973
Amagi...

8
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:07,181
Amagi is a mountain
on the Izu Peninsula.

9
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:13,320
Yasunari Kawabata's novel,
<i>The Izu Dancer</i> is set there.

10
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:17,358
That novel was
written in 1926.

11
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:23,097
I recall climbing
Amagi that very year.

12
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:28,102
I was 15 at the time.

13
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:35,242
I remember meeting
a woman along the way.

14
00:01:39,314 --> 00:01:41,915
It's been nearly 30 years...

15
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:45,986
I can't help feeling fate
has played a trick on me.

16
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:02,803
{\fs40}Crossing Mt. Amagi

17
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:09,443
June 28, 1926

18
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:13,947
Mt. Amagi, Shizuoka Pref.

19
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:41,809
I was thrilled to be
climbing this mountain

20
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,581
that I had seen every day
from afar, in Shimoda.

21
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:53,987
Surely, beyond it was a land
where I could be free.

22
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:14,007
I'd never come
this far before.

23
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:05,959
What are you doing?

24
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:10,931
You gotta put
your back into it.

25
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:23,944
Do a good job
or it won't sell!

26
00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:37,357
Takichi!

27
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:45,065
I could only get
three days' worth.

28
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:47,501
Thanks!

29
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:51,238
Some candy...

30
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,013
Why're you late? One delivery
shouldna taken so long.

31
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:38,752
Where were you?

32
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:41,121
Gimme sake!

33
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:47,194
With Pa like he is,
I'm depending on you.

34
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:49,396
But you keep slacking out.

35
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:55,836
Give the bottle a rest, Pa.
We ain't got no money!

36
00:05:57,238 --> 00:05:59,973
Git some work done...

37
00:05:59,974 --> 00:06:04,444
...'stead of waiting for
handouts from your brother.

38
00:06:05,013 --> 00:06:06,146
Ma...

39
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,684
Can we subscribe
to the paper?

40
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:14,955
I want to learn more
about the world.

41
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,091
I want to read
some books, too.

42
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:20,293
Don't make me laugh!

43
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:23,163
Can I go to
middle school, then?

44
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:28,635
You think we can afford that?

45
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,907
You wanna drink so bad,
we gotta sell Yoshie off.

46
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:38,111
I tell you,
there's no sake!

47
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:57,764
Come on, Hisae...!

48
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:18,251
Why don't you read
when it's light?

49
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:36,369
What is it?

50
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,142
You're always looking
at me like that lately.

51
00:07:48,883 --> 00:07:50,083
Why?

52
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:53,887
Why?

53
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,257
Tell me!

54
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,941
Yugashima   8km
Shuzenji   16km

55
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:12,627
Hey, Sonny!
Where you headed?

56
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:14,162
Shizuoka City.

57
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,064
On foot?

58
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:20,066
Is it far?

59
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,735
Sure!

60
00:10:22,803 --> 00:10:26,039
Did you think it was
just over the hill?

61
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,341
You could take a
train from Mishima,

62
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:32,445
but even that's far —
a good 40 kilometers.

63
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:44,457
How far are you going?

64
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,792
Shuzenji.

65
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:49,896
Can I go with you?

66
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:54,234
Sure, why not?

67
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,208
I gotta air these out
for a while.

68
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,678
You're selling them?

69
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:06,678
I could sell you some.

70
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:08,548
Bean cake!

71
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:10,216
5 sen for two.

72
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,007
Why Shizuoka?

73
00:11:34,508 --> 00:11:38,211
My brother's learning
to be a printer there.

74
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:40,347
You're going all alone?

75
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:49,189
Or... did you
run away from home?

76
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:55,395
I guess all boys go
through that stage.

77
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:57,797
Water?

78
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:07,841
Won't your visit
be a problem

79
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:11,945
if your brother's
still in graining?

80
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:16,416
Even if you are
his brother...

81
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:21,788
I just remembered...
I gotta go this way.

82
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:23,423
What about Shuzenji?

83
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:25,525
Sorry... See ya.

84
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:38,438
I was alone again.

85
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:45,413
And soon beginning to feel
sorry I had left home.

86
00:12:50,618 --> 00:12:51,952
Where are you going?

87
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:54,387
Shuzenji.

88
00:12:54,553 --> 00:12:55,587
Me, too.

89
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,077
You're from Shimoda?

90
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:05,448
You have a thirst for
knowledge?

91
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,752
If they had the money,

92
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:13,256
your folks would send you
to school, I'd bet.

93
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,259
You don't like the work
of a smithy?

94
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,394
It's boring.

95
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:22,333
Life's not easy, you know.

96
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:27,804
I've learned that
from my peddling.

97
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:32,342
Strangers are scary.

98
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:36,680
That means the
world is scary.

99
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:38,149
Know anything
about the world?

100
00:13:40,218 --> 00:13:43,153
It's scary.
Just like a woman.

101
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:47,023
You been with a woman?

102
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:48,358
How old are you?

103
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,759
Fifteen.

104
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:54,331
You'll learn
how scary they are.

105
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:57,601
Remember that tunnel?

106
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:01,204
Weren't you scared
before you entered it?

107
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:04,641
It's a woman,
that's why it's scary.

108
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:10,313
Women and the world...
they're like endless tunnels.

109
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:12,983
Can't see an inch
in front of your nose.

110
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:17,020
Can't tell if there's an
exit beyond the darkness.

111
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:21,324
You may get out,
but what awaits you?

112
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:25,896
It may be Heaven...
then again, it may be Hell.

113
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:27,931
That's why it's
so complicated.

114
00:14:33,137 --> 00:14:34,638
Want to take a break?

115
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:45,949
Just allow us to rest awhile.

116
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:53,690
How much for rice cake?

117
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:54,958
5 sen.

118
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:02,899
Can I go with you
to Shuzenji?

119
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:07,537
Two rice cakes, please.

120
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:16,680
There's a navvy.

121
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:21,918
Guys like him drift
from place to place

122
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,690
looking for
construction jobs.

123
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:30,828
They're troublemakers.
Be wary of them.

124
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,707
For me, too?

125
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:46,176
Thanks, kid.

126
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:58,721
How about this? I'll
make it cheap for you.

127
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:10,333
Kimono peddlers deal
mainly with women.

128
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:14,471
"How about a pretty kimono
for your daughter?"

129
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:17,540
"How about a kimono
for New Year's Day?"

130
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,844
"Add a kimono to your dowry."

131
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:24,848
I go from door to door
and visit the same homes,

132
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:27,517
so I learn a lot
about the families.

133
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:30,653
That gives me an advantage.

134
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:37,894
Actually, I'm pretty
popular with women.

135
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:41,664
When I tell them stories of
places like Tokyo or Kyoto,

136
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:44,367
they practically swoon.

137
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:46,970
You've been to Tokyo?

138
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:50,607
I just make believe I've been.

139
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:59,449
Saki's back? Did she
leave her husband?

140
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:04,988
I'm gonna make a stop here.
See you around.

141
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:07,357
She's an old friend...

142
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:26,963
Where are you going?

143
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:30,500
Back to Shimoda.

144
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:33,770
Shimoda...?

145
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:38,908
Perfect. I'll join you.

146
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:55,625
I wonder how far
it is to Shimoda.

147
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:57,494
About 40 kilometers.

148
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:02,565
Guess we can't
get there by tonight.

149
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:06,396
Try taking off your sandals.
It's easier walking barefoot.

150
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:11,100
Just wear them
over rocky ground.

151
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:22,445
Well?

152
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:23,680
Feels good!

153
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:25,882
Nice and cool.

154
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,748
Come over there!

155
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,989
I'll do it.

156
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,700
It smells nice.

157
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,272
I'm sorry.
It's my powder.

158
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:35,653
<i>In the glow of evening,
red dragonflies</i>

159
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:42,894
<i>How long since I saw them
from my mother's back?</i>

160
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:49,467
<i>The mulberries in
the mountain fields</i>

161
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:56,240
<i>Did really pick them
on so long ago?</i>

162
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,444
You learned that in school?

163
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:01,844
Yes.

164
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,017
They even teach you
songs there!?

165
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,486
What about you?

166
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,723
Never went to school.

167
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,864
And you...
Why are you alone?

168
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,337
You live in Shimoda?

169
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,308
What does your father do?

170
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,842
He's a blacksmith.

171
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,744
You're taking over?

172
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:34,879
No.

173
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,082
Any brothers and sisters?

174
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,353
Two older brothers
and two younger sisters.

175
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,756
Then, your brother will
take over the business.

176
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,260
They've both left home.

177
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:58,569
I just visited my brother
in Shizuoka City.

178
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:01,605
That leaves only you.

179
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,508
I hate being a smithy.

180
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:12,483
I want to continue
my education.

181
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:18,089
And become some great person?

182
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:22,126
I don't want to be great.

183
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:26,263
I just want to see the world.

184
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,268
I want to work.

185
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,772
To do that, I need to study.

186
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:41,746
And one day you'll be
king of your own castle.

187
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:50,154
A man's gotta dream big.
I wish you success.

188
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,057
You can do it!

189
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:58,029
My pa won't let me.

190
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:02,333
What about your mother?

191
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,850
Our home is Hell!

192
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:25,389
I want to leave it
as soon as I can.

193
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,527
Hell...?

194
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:38,269
Your only choice is
to escape from Hell.

195
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:45,443
Of course, there may be
another Hell awaiting you.

196
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:49,046
But, it's better
than just waiting.

197
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,816
Where are you from?

198
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:52,918
Me...?

199
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,924
I've been moving
from place to place...

200
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:04,962
...from one dangerous
rock to another.

201
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:08,999
Who knows when I might fall?

202
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:14,706
This might be the
end of the road for me.

203
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,335
The branch got you.

204
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,881
Can't let germs get in.

205
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,311
Is this edible?

206
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,246
Not till autumn.

207
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,583
You sure are smart.

208
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,351
Where are you
spending the night?

209
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,489
Maybe in Yugano.

210
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,993
Oh? How nice.

211
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,130
What about you?

212
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,734
Under the stars, I guess.

213
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:33,337
Then I'll join you.

214
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,214
Who's that, I wonder.

215
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,949
A drifting navvy.

216
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:55,360
I was warned to be wary
of drifters like him.

217
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:57,761
Why?

218
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,698
Guys like him cause trouble.

219
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,437
What sort of trouble,
I wonder.

220
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:09,807
If he dares,
I'll protect you.

221
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,577
How sweet!

222
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,623
Listen...

223
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,493
I want you to go on ahead.

224
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:33,097
I have to talk to that guy.

225
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:35,032
What about Shimoda?

226
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:39,336
I might be a little delayed.

227
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,706
I'll wait here.

228
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,042
No. Go on!

229
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:56,920
I have to talk to that guy.
Go on ahead.

230
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,792
I'll catch up to you
when I'm done.

231
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,278
Then, the next day, I returned
to my home in Shimoda.

232
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:00,050
And now, it's nearly
30 years later.

233
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,854
What a shock!

234
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,958
Among these pages,
I discovered references

235
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,295
to the drifter and the
beautiful woman I met

236
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:15,899
when I crossed Mt. Amagi
almost 30 years ago.

237
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:20,737
Even my name was mentioned.

238
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,341
Sir! A visitor.

239
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,416
I'm Tajima. I ordered
a print job.

240
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:53,007
I was about to send it
to you for proofing.

241
00:32:53,008 --> 00:32:57,044
I was in the neighborhood.

242
00:32:58,814 --> 00:33:05,152
I'm sure there were
larger printers in Shizuoka.

243
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:07,988
They were busy, it being
the end of the year.

244
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:11,358
A friend of mine
recommended you.

245
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:21,969
You're with the police?

246
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:27,408
I retired last year, but
I help out part-time now.

247
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,411
Since I have time
in my hands,

248
00:33:30,412 --> 00:33:35,449
I decided to write up
some of my old cases.

249
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:40,421
I suppose you read this.

250
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:42,823
I glanced through it.

251
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:48,262
Did anything catch
your interest?

252
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:51,065
All of them...

253
00:33:54,903 --> 00:34:00,708
I thought the Amagi case
especially interesting.

254
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:11,519
That murder on Mt. Amagi has
weighed heavily on my mind.

255
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,821
Whys that?

256
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:22,930
The case began with a report
from the Yugashima police.

257
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:27,768
It was June 29, 1926.

258
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:37,211
The site was on the Yugashima
side of the Amagi tunnel,

259
00:34:37,212 --> 00:34:39,914
near the Shirahashi bridge.

260
00:34:41,116 --> 00:34:44,185
We discovered some
personal belongings,

261
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:47,121
but here was no one in sight.

262
00:35:10,145 --> 00:35:12,079
There was a struggle here.

263
00:35:21,323 --> 00:35:23,290
The plants are crushed.

264
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:06,300
It looked like the owner
of these belongings

265
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:09,970
had gotten into trouble.

266
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:14,108
We searched the area
the next day.

267
00:36:31,126 --> 00:36:33,494
Nice and cool
in this ice shed.

268
00:36:42,804 --> 00:36:44,038
The owner...

269
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:56,417
These footprints...
They yours?

270
00:36:56,418 --> 00:36:58,152
They ain't mine.

271
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:01,355
You're sure?

272
00:37:02,457 --> 00:37:05,693
Covered the ice with
a nice layer of sawdust

273
00:37:05,694 --> 00:37:09,463
day before yesterday,
the 28th.

274
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,100
Ain't been in since.

275
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:16,937
Get someone to check
the footprints.

276
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:29,583
Shimoda Police

277
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,656
From the type of clothing
and other belongings,

278
00:37:35,724 --> 00:37:40,327
the victim was
probably a navvy.

279
00:37:41,162 --> 00:37:42,363
Check it out.

280
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:46,300
Now, this vest...

281
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:50,771
A coin purse with money and
tobacco were in the pocket.

282
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:55,609
All but the bottom
button are missing,

283
00:37:55,610 --> 00:38:02,016
and these shorts were
inside-out when found.

284
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:06,587
They were probably removed
forcibly by someone else.

285
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:14,528
Judging from this slit, the
victim is probably injured.

286
00:38:15,663 --> 00:38:19,633
Why would a robber
leave the coin purse?

287
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:30,778
June 28, about 8:00 AM,

288
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:35,549
a man who looked like a navvy
was seen headed toward Amagi.

289
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:39,853
He was seen near Yugashima
about 3:00 PM the same day.

290
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:42,790
Witnesses describe him as...

291
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:47,428
5'7", short-cropped hair,
about 45 years old.

292
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:49,730
He was headed toward Amagi.

293
00:38:54,702 --> 00:39:01,375
The body was discovered
on July 10.

294
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:11,652
It was located at Namesawa,
downstream of Wasabizawa.

295
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:36,734
Do that somewhere
else, will you?

296
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:45,609
What did you find?

297
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:50,815
It's summer and the body
was in the water so long

298
00:39:50,816 --> 00:39:52,084
it was badly decomposed.

299
00:39:53,885 --> 00:39:56,320
He been dead about 10 days.

300
00:39:56,321 --> 00:40:01,225
I'd say he was
35-50 years old.

301
00:40:01,226 --> 00:40:02,493
Cause of death?

302
00:40:02,494 --> 00:40:08,799
There is a knife wound
in his back, here.

303
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,802
The wounds about
2-1/2 inches deep.

304
00:40:11,803 --> 00:40:14,305
He probably bled to death.

305
00:40:15,407 --> 00:40:19,377
I have a feeling
it was murder.

306
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:23,047
He couldn't have
stabbed himself!

307
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:27,051
Thank you very much.

308
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:30,888
Sir...

309
00:40:31,957 --> 00:40:37,995
The wound in his back and
the slash in the vest match.

310
00:40:37,996 --> 00:40:40,564
So, that victim was the navvy.

311
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:46,237
On June 27 and 28,

312
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:51,475
the victim progressed toward
Amagi on the Shimoda Road.

313
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:58,149
On the 29th, we found
his belongings here.

314
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:03,687
On July 10, his body
was found here.

315
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,591
From all this,
we can surmise

316
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:13,064
that he was killed here
and thrown into the river.

317
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:19,136
It rained heavily In the hills
on the night of June 28.

318
00:41:19,137 --> 00:41:24,508
The raging river probably
carried his body downstream

319
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:29,547
where it was discovered
on July 10.

320
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:37,721
Thus, the time of the crime
has been narrowed

321
00:41:37,722 --> 00:41:40,257
to the night of June 28.

322
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:47,832
We concentrated on discovering
was on Mt. Amagi

323
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:53,771
around the time
the victim was there.

324
00:41:56,741 --> 00:42:03,214
Two people came to light.

325
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:12,123
A priest in Yugashima saw
a barefoot woman of 26-27,

326
00:42:12,124 --> 00:42:20,965
wearing a flashy kimono
walking toward Amagi.

327
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:27,505
Three hours later, at a
tea shop on the mountain,

328
00:42:27,506 --> 00:42:30,341
the owner and a customer

329
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:33,444
saw a woman who looked
like a prostitute

330
00:42:33,445 --> 00:42:39,550
and a boy of about 15
heading toward Amagi tunnel.

331
00:42:41,786 --> 00:42:51,095
The two were seen descending
toward Shimoda the next day.

332
00:42:52,297 --> 00:42:55,933
About 7 AM on the 29th,

333
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:59,904
a woman who looked
like a prostitute

334
00:42:59,905 --> 00:43:04,909
was seen walking
toward Shimoda.

335
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:14,685
A little later, a young boy
was seen headed for Shimoda.

336
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:20,591
We later discovered
that the only people

337
00:43:20,592 --> 00:43:26,697
on Mt. Amagi after dark
on the night of the crime

338
00:43:26,698 --> 00:43:31,268
were that woman
and the young boy.

339
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:34,872
It took the two of them
the whole night

340
00:43:34,873 --> 00:43:37,741
to get to the other side.

341
00:43:40,111 --> 00:43:44,648
We searched for
the two people.

342
00:43:44,649 --> 00:43:47,451
We soon found out
who the boy was.

343
00:43:49,721 --> 00:43:54,458
Takichi, the cops
wanna see you.

344
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:00,464
What happened?

345
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,741
Did he do something?

346
00:44:10,742 --> 00:44:14,578
We just want to hear
about Mt. Amagi.

347
00:44:15,213 --> 00:44:19,550
You crossed Mt. Amagi
on June 28, didn't you?

348
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:23,153
He left early in the morning.

349
00:44:23,154 --> 00:44:27,291
I was real worried, but
he came home the next day.

350
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:31,629
Did you meet anyone on
the mountain on the 28th?

351
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:35,332
A cake dealer and
kimono peddler.

352
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,767
Anyone else?

353
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,909
When I turned back
at Yugashima,

354
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:48,746
I came across a woman.

355
00:44:49,748 --> 00:44:53,417
How far did you
accompany her?

356
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:57,154
Till the entrance
to the Amagi tunnel.

357
00:44:57,155 --> 00:44:59,723
The woman was alone?

358
00:45:03,628 --> 00:45:09,767
No one will be upset with you
for telling the truth.

359
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:17,541
She told me she wanted to
talk to a laborer there.

360
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:27,685
Nothing to worry about.

361
00:45:29,287 --> 00:45:32,456
We've got to find
that woman.

362
00:45:32,457 --> 00:45:34,258
Get an ID on her.

363
00:45:35,727 --> 00:45:38,896
Judging from the fact
that she was on foot,

364
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:41,799
and she looked like
a prostitute,

365
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:48,505
I'd say she works at one of
the spas in the area.

366
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:54,678
She's probably somewhere
near Shimoda.

367
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:58,549
She may have headed for
Kawazu or Ito.

368
00:46:12,868 --> 00:46:14,302
Shimoda Precinct.

369
00:46:15,404 --> 00:46:16,571
Shimoda!

370
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,442
Er... yes, sir.

371
00:46:23,612 --> 00:46:26,414
Shuzenji teahouse...
a prostitute?

372
00:46:41,063 --> 00:46:43,631
Come visit again, honey.

373
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:55,143
Welcome, sirs.

374
00:46:57,346 --> 00:47:01,015
You're here about Hana?

375
00:47:02,651 --> 00:47:05,386
Behave yourselves in front
of the detectives?

376
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:06,955
Get to the back.

377
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:11,726
Clear outa here!

378
00:47:16,031 --> 00:47:19,334
She ran away on the
28th of last month?

379
00:47:19,335 --> 00:47:20,735
That's right.

380
00:47:20,736 --> 00:47:24,906
Hear you had men looking
for her. Any luck?

381
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:26,341
Not a trace.

382
00:47:27,776 --> 00:47:34,882
That woman's a pain!
She still owes me 300 yen!

383
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:37,619
What's she like?

384
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:39,887
Well...

385
00:47:40,122 --> 00:47:42,056
She's a mean one.

386
00:47:42,057 --> 00:47:45,293
Wouldn't surprise me if
she killed somebody.

387
00:47:45,294 --> 00:47:49,263
She tried to get me
with iron tongs once.

388
00:47:49,832 --> 00:47:51,899
She almost killed me!

389
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:55,103
Shimoda Precinct...

390
00:47:55,804 --> 00:47:59,474
We've ID'd the woman
we put the APB out on.

391
00:47:59,475 --> 00:48:03,378
Date of birth: June 1899
Place: Kuji, Ibaraki Pref.

392
00:48:03,379 --> 00:48:05,813
Name: Hana Otsuka (27)

393
00:48:27,636 --> 00:48:30,672
July 15
Oshima Island

394
00:48:41,784 --> 00:48:43,117
Welcome...

395
00:48:59,301 --> 00:49:00,735
What will it be?

396
00:49:02,237 --> 00:49:04,272
You're Hana Otsuka?

397
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:09,610
You were once at Teahouse
Ikoma in Shuzenji?

398
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:10,413
Who're you?

399
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,447
The police.

400
00:49:30,165 --> 00:49:33,534
Let me go!
Let me go!

401
00:49:50,152 --> 00:49:55,623
We took Hana to Shimoda
the next day.

402
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:05,366
Takichi!
That woman's been caught.

403
00:50:06,602 --> 00:50:09,804
They're bringing her
from Oshima by ship.

404
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:24,779
Murderer!

405
00:51:48,413 --> 00:51:54,118
But Hana didn't admit
to the crime.

406
00:52:00,526 --> 00:52:03,928
No way! I never
killed nobody!

407
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:07,331
Why are you doing this to me?

408
00:52:13,372 --> 00:52:14,505
Hana Otsuka!

409
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:17,808
Your permanent address...?

410
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:19,645
Tell me!

411
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:28,786
4218 Oriashi
Kuji, Ibaraki Pref.

412
00:52:28,787 --> 00:52:29,921
Right?

413
00:52:30,889 --> 00:52:33,224
Why would I kill a navvy?

414
00:52:33,325 --> 00:52:34,458
For his money!

415
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:41,899
You met the laborer on
Mt. Amagi on June 28.

416
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,736
The boy who was with you
told us you sent him ahead

417
00:52:45,737 --> 00:52:49,473
because you wanted
to talk to the navvy.

418
00:52:50,475 --> 00:52:53,110
You had run away
from your brothel

419
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:55,947
without any money
that day.

420
00:52:57,149 --> 00:53:04,822
And yet, the night of the 28th,
you stayed at inn in Yugano

421
00:53:04,823 --> 00:53:08,926
and paid them 60 sen
the next morning.

422
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:14,465
What's more, you signed in
as Mitsu Moriyama.

423
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,402
You did it cause
you killed the man!

424
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:23,007
He gave me that money.
Two 50-sen coins.

425
00:53:23,008 --> 00:53:27,244
He agreed to pay it.

426
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:35,019
Who'd give you money just
to talk on the roadside?

427
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,864
What's the laugh for?

428
00:53:49,901 --> 00:53:52,203
You know what it's about.

429
00:53:55,574 --> 00:53:57,476
I sold him my body.

430
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,014
For 1 yen!

431
00:54:10,022 --> 00:54:17,094
There was a nice grassy spot
near the tunnel entrance.

432
00:54:20,532 --> 00:54:25,736
I lay down like this.

433
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:29,942
I could see the sky.

434
00:54:33,912 --> 00:54:38,416
I saw the evening sky
beyond the man's face.

435
00:55:09,147 --> 00:55:10,915
Let me out!

436
00:55:11,783 --> 00:55:14,752
What did I do?
Let me out!

437
00:56:10,828 --> 00:56:12,161
Hot, isn't it?

438
00:56:14,031 --> 00:56:15,899
You bribing me?

439
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,834
Nothing like that.

440
00:56:28,245 --> 00:56:29,712
What's so funny?

441
00:56:29,713 --> 00:56:31,180
I'm laughing?

442
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:34,484
My folks told me
to always smile,

443
00:56:34,485 --> 00:56:38,988
'cause I look like
a criminal if I don't.

444
00:56:41,325 --> 00:56:43,693
You look worse
when you smile.

445
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:08,084
Drink up.

446
00:57:16,193 --> 00:57:18,027
You're from Ibaraki?

447
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,135
Why'd you come to Shuzenji?

448
00:57:29,406 --> 00:57:32,075
I didn't come straight there.

449
00:57:33,444 --> 00:57:35,745
You've been through a lot?

450
00:57:44,722 --> 00:57:49,726
I was sent to work at
an inn when I was 14.

451
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:54,130
There were too many
kids at home.

452
00:57:54,131 --> 00:57:57,367
Guess my folks sold me off.

453
00:57:58,431 --> 00:57:59,547
I see.

454
00:58:03,874 --> 00:58:06,178
My contract ended
when turned 20.

455
00:58:08,379 --> 00:58:09,646
I went on to Atami.

456
00:58:10,547 --> 00:58:11,981
Your folks...?

457
00:58:11,982 --> 00:58:15,351
I never wanted
to see them again.

458
00:58:15,352 --> 00:58:18,221
Atami was better.

459
00:58:18,989 --> 00:58:20,223
Why?

460
00:58:22,026 --> 00:58:25,361
I heard it was warm there.

461
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:29,232
It's by the sea, there're
lots of hot sprigs

462
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:32,035
and it's warm in winter.

463
00:58:32,703 --> 00:58:33,971
You like it warm?

464
00:58:38,642 --> 00:58:42,111
It was always cold
when I was little.

465
00:58:44,548 --> 00:58:47,150
I wanted to go
somewhere warm.

466
00:58:52,289 --> 00:58:55,425
What did you do in Atami?

467
00:59:00,464 --> 00:59:02,298
Worked at an inn.

468
00:59:07,271 --> 00:59:09,539
Hooked up with a cook.

469
00:59:14,078 --> 00:59:18,347
Found out he had
another woman.

470
00:59:18,348 --> 00:59:24,087
I didn't mind,
but I guess she did.

471
00:59:24,088 --> 00:59:27,458
That cook got
stabbed by her.

472
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,860
He died?

473
00:59:33,063 --> 00:59:38,634
No, but I didn't want
to stay there any longer.

474
00:59:41,171 --> 00:59:44,474
I spent only
one year in Atami.

475
00:59:46,176 --> 00:59:49,178
I moved to Mishima,
then Numazu...

476
00:59:49,179 --> 00:59:52,415
...to Ito, then Shuzenji.

477
00:59:53,183 --> 00:59:58,187
And this is Shimoda.
You've circled the peninsula!

478
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:05,561
Everywhere I went...
it was hell.

479
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:14,570
Why'd you run away from
that teahouse in Shuzenji?

480
01:00:14,571 --> 01:00:19,242
Teahouse...?
It's just brothel.

481
01:00:21,512 --> 01:00:23,946
That's why...

482
01:00:23,947 --> 01:00:28,751
I wanted to find myself
a different life.

483
01:00:28,752 --> 01:00:31,554
I was losing myself!

484
01:00:34,925 --> 01:00:36,459
Damn you!

485
01:00:39,897 --> 01:00:40,930
What is it?

486
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:42,598
You stole my john!

487
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:44,700
Who?

488
01:00:44,701 --> 01:00:45,835
Shin!

489
01:00:47,938 --> 01:00:51,274
He was yours?

490
01:00:52,376 --> 01:00:53,843
Damn you!

491
01:01:48,498 --> 01:01:49,632
You sneaky bitch!

492
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:52,568
You shoulda put
a leash on him!

493
01:02:26,169 --> 01:02:28,471
You gonna kill me?

494
01:02:29,773 --> 01:02:31,340
Don't think I won't.

495
01:02:42,152 --> 01:02:46,722
Hana, must you always
cause trouble?

496
01:02:48,025 --> 01:02:49,525
I don't mean to.

497
01:02:50,093 --> 01:02:52,528
Then don't go stealing
customers.

498
01:02:52,529 --> 01:02:55,464
She's too old to get
her own johns.

499
01:03:01,672 --> 01:03:04,507
If you didn't owe me money,

500
01:03:04,508 --> 01:03:08,511
I'd toss an old bag
like you out!

501
01:03:10,247 --> 01:03:18,721
You get no customers, so
you drink all day.

502
01:03:19,923 --> 01:03:23,326
You're just getting older
and deeper in debt.

503
01:03:23,327 --> 01:03:25,227
More wrinkled, too!

504
01:03:28,131 --> 01:03:29,899
What're you gonna do?

505
01:03:31,969 --> 01:03:37,340
Nobody'd wanna marry you.
What you gonna do?

506
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:43,913
Maybe there's some old geezer
out there who'll take her.

507
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:48,084
That might be
your only choice.

508
01:03:48,085 --> 01:03:53,456
Go sweet talk some bugger
out of his savings.

509
01:03:53,457 --> 01:03:58,361
Pay off your debt to me
and get lost.

510
01:03:58,362 --> 01:04:01,664
That would make me
very happy.

511
01:04:13,243 --> 01:04:15,311
Make up your mind!

512
01:05:58,484 --> 01:05:59,818
You better eat!

513
01:06:06,425 --> 01:06:08,426
How long are you
keeping me here?

514
01:06:08,427 --> 01:06:10,829
Let me out!
What did I do?

515
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,475
Why'd you head for Mt. Amagi?

516
01:06:59,845 --> 01:07:02,680
How many times
do I have to tell you?

517
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:11,589
I figured they'd be looking
for me in Ohito or Nagaoka.

518
01:07:12,692 --> 01:07:13,725
I see.

519
01:07:14,994 --> 01:07:19,030
It wouldn't occur to them
that I'd cross Mt. Amagi.

520
01:07:19,031 --> 01:07:20,899
That's what I told you!

521
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:33,778
Where did you meet up
with the laborer?

522
01:07:34,713 --> 01:07:36,781
I told you that already!

523
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:39,717
Where did you meet him?

524
01:07:46,192 --> 01:07:48,193
Shall I repeat that?

525
01:07:50,462 --> 01:07:51,830
The tunnel entrance.

526
01:07:53,098 --> 01:07:56,034
Weren't you with a boy?

527
01:07:56,035 --> 01:07:58,570
I sent him ahead.

528
01:08:03,509 --> 01:08:06,945
We agreed on a price so
I led him into the bushes.

529
01:08:06,979 --> 01:08:08,680
And you had sex.

530
01:08:16,055 --> 01:08:22,360
Listen... you wanna hear
all the details?

531
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:27,098
I want to hear
what happened after.

532
01:08:29,902 --> 01:08:32,270
He gave me the money
and I split!

533
01:08:32,671 --> 01:08:39,210
Didn't you kill him?
Then you went to the ice shed.

534
01:08:40,746 --> 01:08:41,980
Ice shed?

535
01:08:42,514 --> 01:08:44,115
You planned to sleep there

536
01:08:44,116 --> 01:08:48,286
but there was ice,
so it was too cold.

537
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:53,658
Instead, you walked to Yugano
and stayed at an inn. Right?

538
01:08:55,394 --> 01:08:57,228
What's an ice shed?

539
01:08:57,229 --> 01:08:59,397
Where ice made in winter
is stored.

540
01:08:59,398 --> 01:09:06,104
We found some footprints in
the sawdust covering the ice.

541
01:09:07,973 --> 01:09:11,976
Size 6 barefoot prints.

542
01:09:13,112 --> 01:09:15,647
Barefoot...

543
01:09:17,883 --> 01:09:22,587
We know you walked
the roads barefoot.

544
01:09:24,023 --> 01:09:27,091
And your feet are size 6!

545
01:09:45,711 --> 01:09:48,313
You left the man behind

546
01:09:48,314 --> 01:09:51,816
as soon as your
business was done?

547
01:09:52,518 --> 01:09:53,450
Yes...

548
01:09:53,852 --> 01:09:55,887
When'd he pay you?

549
01:09:56,555 --> 01:09:58,323
Just before I left.

550
01:09:58,324 --> 01:10:00,391
He didn't hold back?

551
01:10:05,698 --> 01:10:09,000
We'd agreed on 50 sen,

552
01:10:09,001 --> 01:10:11,237
but I begged him
for another 50.

553
01:10:12,538 --> 01:10:15,073
He agreed?

554
01:10:17,242 --> 01:10:20,144
He complained at first.

555
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:25,450
I don't know
what happened after!

556
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:29,587
He was clumsily packing
his things, so I left.

557
01:10:29,588 --> 01:10:31,356
Then, he was killed.

558
01:10:31,357 --> 01:10:32,857
It wasn't me!

559
01:10:32,858 --> 01:10:36,928
You were the only people
on the mountain that night!

560
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:48,239
It was about 9 PM when you
arrived at the inn in Yugano.

561
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:53,177
If you had sex,

562
01:10:53,178 --> 01:10:57,682
then killed the guy and
stripped off his clothes,

563
01:10:57,683 --> 01:11:01,753
you would have reached
the inn just about 9:00.

564
01:11:01,754 --> 01:11:03,454
Bet you fought
over the money.

565
01:11:06,225 --> 01:11:10,828
As you were arguing, your
violent nature took over.

566
01:11:10,829 --> 01:11:14,699
No telling what you'll do
when you lose your head.

567
01:11:16,168 --> 01:11:21,172
You attacked that whore at
the teahouse with iron tongs!

568
01:11:22,975 --> 01:11:25,209
Isn't that what
happened on Amagi?

569
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:29,213
You got mad and stabbed him
with a knife or something.

570
01:11:35,287 --> 01:11:36,754
It wasn't me!

571
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:37,522
Then who?

572
01:11:37,523 --> 01:11:38,556
I don't know!

573
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:42,960
You sent that boy ahead

574
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:47,331
so you were the only one
on the mountain that night.

575
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:56,641
You were seen leaving
the Yugano inn

576
01:11:56,642 --> 01:12:00,278
on the morning of the 29th.

577
01:12:01,747 --> 01:12:07,151
A little later, the boy
headed for Shimoda.

578
01:12:12,691 --> 01:12:16,027
Where'd he spend the night?

579
01:12:17,196 --> 01:12:21,499
He spent the night outside
a temple near Yugano.

580
01:12:24,069 --> 01:12:26,103
Why don't you confess?

581
01:12:27,172 --> 01:12:31,909
This is the end of
the line for you.

582
01:12:33,412 --> 01:12:37,215
You'll either end up
back at the same brothel,

583
01:12:37,216 --> 01:12:41,552
or dead by some roadside.

584
01:13:07,546 --> 01:13:10,882
<i>If he causes any trouble,
I'll protect you.</i>

585
01:13:13,585 --> 01:13:15,586
<i>How sweet!</i>

586
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:40,253
I...

587
01:13:44,983 --> 01:13:48,653
...I killed him.

588
01:13:49,855 --> 01:13:50,588
Good girl!

589
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:19,150
<i>In the glow of evening
red dragonflies</i>

590
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:37,201
<i>How long since saw them
from my mother's back?</i>

591
01:14:37,202 --> 01:14:52,483
<i>The mulberries in
the mountain fields</i>

592
01:14:52,484 --> 01:15:03,361
<i>Did I really pick them
oh so long ago?</i>

593
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,900
You're not cold?

594
01:15:11,169 --> 01:15:14,839
I've got to let air in
from time to time.

595
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:24,482
But, Hana Otsuka
was found innocent.

596
01:15:27,052 --> 01:15:29,186
After she confessed,

597
01:15:29,187 --> 01:15:35,359
she seemed to not care
what happened to her.

598
01:15:36,361 --> 01:15:39,397
She said she threw the
weapon into the river,

599
01:15:39,398 --> 01:15:42,033
but it was never found.

600
01:15:42,034 --> 01:15:48,272
Her story was ambiguous and
there was no conclusive proof,

601
01:15:48,273 --> 01:15:50,775
in December of that year,

602
01:15:50,776 --> 01:15:56,013
the charges were dropped
and she was set free.

603
01:16:09,061 --> 01:16:13,898
It's been nearly 30 years...

604
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:21,072
The statute of limitations
ran out 15 years ago.

605
01:16:21,073 --> 01:16:27,144
Looking back, there were
many things we did wrong.

606
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:34,418
We couldn't get any
footprints at the scene

607
01:16:34,419 --> 01:16:37,321
during our initial
investigation.

608
01:16:37,322 --> 01:16:44,362
Unfortunately, a downpour that
night obliterated any prints.

609
01:16:46,932 --> 01:16:53,504
We never uncovered what
the weapon was, exactly.

610
01:16:57,042 --> 01:16:58,909
To this day?

611
01:16:59,778 --> 01:17:01,479
Yes.

612
01:17:06,151 --> 01:17:12,623
Then... there are the footprints
we found in the ice shed.

613
01:17:12,624 --> 01:17:16,160
I think we were
wrong to decide

614
01:17:16,161 --> 01:17:21,732
the footprints were
those of a woman.

615
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:27,304
But I feel that someone
spent the night

616
01:17:27,339 --> 01:17:32,910
in that ice shed that night.

617
01:17:35,847 --> 01:17:37,014
But...

618
01:17:40,085 --> 01:17:44,789
Wouldn't it be too cold
to sleep on the ice?

619
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:49,226
The sawdust must have
been damp, too.

620
01:17:49,227 --> 01:17:54,131
I talked to a man who harvests
natural ice for a living.

621
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:58,869
He says he naps in the shed
during the summer.

622
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:02,106
There's a ladder in the shed.

623
01:18:02,107 --> 01:18:05,943
If you lay the ladder
down over the ice

624
01:18:05,944 --> 01:18:12,683
and place a plank over it,
you get a simple bed.

625
01:18:12,684 --> 01:18:19,123
You don't get any sawdust
on you, and it isn't cold.

626
01:18:20,992 --> 01:18:31,669
I've a feeling there was a
ladder in the shed that night.

627
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:43,714
A young boy accompanied Hana
partway over the mountain.

628
01:18:44,716 --> 01:18:51,622
He told us that he descended
the mountain ahead of Hana,

629
01:18:51,623 --> 01:18:56,126
after parting with her.

630
01:18:57,562 --> 01:19:02,600
But, it wasn't till the
afternoon of the 29th

631
01:19:02,601 --> 01:19:03,803
that he reached his home.

632
01:19:04,604 --> 01:19:10,908
Where did he spend
the night of the 28th?

633
01:19:13,945 --> 01:19:18,782
A size 6 footprint need not
belong to a woman.

634
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:27,658
It could belong to young boy.
Don't you agree?

635
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:44,275
Mr. Tajima...

636
01:19:46,311 --> 01:19:50,080
You don't think
Hana killed him?

637
01:19:50,448 --> 01:19:52,883
Not anymore.

638
01:19:56,388 --> 01:20:03,527
We should've probed more deeply
into the actions of the boy.

639
01:20:03,528 --> 01:20:10,668
He was a child of 15, so
we never suspected him.

640
01:20:20,412 --> 01:20:24,915
I wonder why Hana said
she killed the man?

641
01:20:26,217 --> 01:20:28,054
I've been puzzling over that.

642
01:20:33,658 --> 01:20:36,762
I wondered about the song...

643
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:49,073
Why did she sing that song?

644
01:20:51,476 --> 01:21:02,152
As she murmured the song,
she seemed like a little girl.

645
01:21:02,153 --> 01:21:13,063
Like she was trying to protect
something pure and innocent.

646
01:21:20,138 --> 01:21:26,710
While working on this book,
I took a trip to Shimoda.

647
01:21:29,781 --> 01:21:38,088
The boys home is now
a garage for tour buses.

648
01:21:38,089 --> 01:21:43,260
The boy left Shimoda
over 20 years ago.

649
01:21:45,764 --> 01:21:52,336
It wasn't long after
that Japan went to war.

650
01:21:53,505 --> 01:21:57,374
Who knows what became of him?

651
01:22:01,479 --> 01:22:04,682
Sorry to take so much
of your time.

652
01:22:07,118 --> 01:22:12,089
When will this be ready?

653
01:22:15,226 --> 01:22:19,830
I'd like to have it by
the end of the month.

654
01:22:19,831 --> 01:22:21,065
I'll rush it.

655
01:23:37,795 --> 01:23:40,097
Hana Otsuka

656
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:21,842
How about another 50 sen?

657
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,845
You said 50.

658
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:30,084
Listen, I made it
real cheap for you!

659
01:27:33,315 --> 01:27:35,015
You were watching?

660
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:39,680
I was in such a panic,

661
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:42,850
I don't remember how
I stripped his clothes off.

662
01:28:42,851 --> 01:28:46,420
I couldn't find
any money on him.

663
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:50,424
But, I wasn't really
after his money.

664
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:19,646
I've never told anyone
about what happened.

665
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:30,858
After awhile, the incident
faded from my memory.

666
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:35,863
There was a long war, and so
much confusion afterwards,

667
01:30:35,864 --> 01:30:40,701
the incident became hidden
in the recesses of my mind.

668
01:30:40,702 --> 01:30:44,538
Until I heard the
detective's story today.

669
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:41,995
I can no longer be tried
for what I did that night,

670
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:48,836
but the shock running through
me now will never fade away.

671
01:32:46,275 --> 01:32:47,909
Your records room...?

672
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:48,810
3rd floor.

673
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:56,510
Come in.

674
01:33:57,579 --> 01:33:59,280
I've brought your books.

675
01:34:00,749 --> 01:34:03,184
I had to come
this way, anyway.

676
01:34:04,453 --> 01:34:06,087
Thank you for coming.

677
01:34:35,584 --> 01:34:38,152
So, you've come....

678
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,855
I thought I should.

679
01:34:46,228 --> 01:34:48,863
It must have been
a heavy burden.

680
01:34:48,997 --> 01:34:50,238
No...

681
01:34:56,204 --> 01:34:57,705
...Yes.

682
01:35:07,916 --> 01:35:10,685
Thanks for your trouble.

683
01:35:24,032 --> 01:35:31,470
I still can't figure out
why he was killed.

684
01:35:39,414 --> 01:35:41,983
It wasn't written there.

685
01:35:45,821 --> 01:35:53,260
It probably had to do with
feelings for the woman.

686
01:36:01,069 --> 01:36:06,674
I guess only those
involved would know.

687
01:36:15,217 --> 01:36:15,983
Yes?

688
01:36:18,286 --> 01:36:23,491
...What become of
Hana Otsuka?

689
01:36:27,629 --> 01:36:35,237
She moved from town to town.
Seems she's in Noto now.

690
01:36:37,739 --> 01:36:39,440
She's alive?

691
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:59,560
She sells seafoods at
the morning market there.

692
01:37:43,163 --> 01:37:45,365
Where's the morning market?

693
01:38:57,722 --> 01:38:59,723
You're leaving, Hana?

694
01:40:21,739 --> 01:40:23,373
You want something?

695
01:40:26,010 --> 01:40:30,580
Won't you sell me some fish?

696
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:36,520
I only carry seaweed.

697
01:40:36,821 --> 01:40:37,954
I'd like some.

698
01:40:49,167 --> 01:40:51,134
Your home...?

699
01:40:51,135 --> 01:40:53,103
It's not far.

700
01:40:55,740 --> 01:40:58,375
You live with someone?

701
01:40:58,376 --> 01:41:04,114
No. But no use
sweet-talking me!

702
01:41:10,154 --> 01:41:13,690
You're not from
here, are you?

703
01:41:13,691 --> 01:41:15,292
I'm a traveler.

704
01:41:15,293 --> 01:41:17,594
From where?

705
01:41:17,595 --> 01:41:19,529
The Tokyo area.

706
01:41:23,467 --> 01:41:26,069
I'm originally from Ibaraki.

707
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:29,172
How'd you end up here?

708
01:41:35,346 --> 01:41:39,816
In the old days...

709
01:41:39,817 --> 01:41:45,555
I preferred a warmer
climate. The south.

710
01:41:47,225 --> 01:41:55,398
I lived down there awhile, but
too many things went wrong.

711
01:41:55,399 --> 01:41:58,635
Many things...

712
01:41:58,636 --> 01:42:03,773
there was the war, and
so many other things.

713
01:42:03,774 --> 01:42:07,177
And I liked it better
in a new place.

714
01:42:08,112 --> 01:42:12,616
This isn't Paradise,
but it's a good place.

715
01:42:13,751 --> 01:42:15,218
What did you want?

716
01:42:15,219 --> 01:42:16,319
Seaweed.

717
01:42:17,789 --> 01:42:18,788
40 yen.

718
01:42:36,407 --> 01:42:39,009
Never mind... they're
just leftovers.

719
01:42:44,815 --> 01:42:46,850
Your fingers...

720
01:42:47,485 --> 01:42:49,352
I'm a printer.

721
01:42:50,788 --> 01:42:52,722
The president?

722
01:42:55,793 --> 01:42:58,929
You're king of
your own castle.

723
01:43:14,512 --> 01:43:15,578
Thanks.

724
01:43:21,852 --> 01:43:24,287
Hope you make a fortune!
