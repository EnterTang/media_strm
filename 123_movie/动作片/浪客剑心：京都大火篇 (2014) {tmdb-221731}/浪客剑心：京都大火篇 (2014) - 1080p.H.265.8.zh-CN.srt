2
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:31,171
Settsu Mine, Hyogo
1878 (MEIJI ERA 11)

3
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:05,172
You're really sure he's here?

4
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:08,777
We've been watching for two months.
There's no mistake.

5
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,514
Let's end this here.

6
00:02:03,132 --> 00:02:04,567
Be very careful.

7
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:16,680
Over here!

8
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,453
Who are you?

9
00:02:55,454 --> 00:02:56,454
Halt!

10
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:03,723
Do you believe in hell?

11
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:12,565
Surely a world like this, awash in blood,

12
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,968
deserves the name hell.

13
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:37,991
Are you Makoto Shishio?

14
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,328
What if I am?

15
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,165
You know damn well!

16
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,433
Uh-uh.

17
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:52,104
Don't move from there.

18
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:56,676
I love that sound!

19
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:59,347
You bastard!

20
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:02,515
Why do you think I knew you were coming?

21
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:11,525
Hajime Saito of the Shogun's
Shinsengumi police.

22
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,128
A traitor...

23
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:18,532
We both remember the Shogun.

24
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:22,536
Are you content with
what this world has become?

25
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:27,140
Take off that new-government uniform.

26
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:29,811
Come and join us.

27
00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:34,816
We will turn the clock back
to those days of upheaval.

28
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:38,553
I take orders from no one.

29
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,821
No?

30
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:44,325
Very well.

31
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,871
Shishio!

32
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:18,761
Man is born to carnage.

33
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:21,864
This world itself is hell.

34
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:23,097
Shishio!

35
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:14,250
RUROUNI KENSHIN: KYOTO INFERNO

36
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:24,160
Kyoto is in chaos!

37
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:27,063
What do the Shogun's police
think they're doing?

38
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:28,732
Indeed!

39
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:33,403
At least they shouldn't be
adding to the trouble!

40
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:35,105
Onward.

41
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,341
Who's that?

42
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:42,079
Here he comes!

43
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:49,120
Who are you?

44
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:51,789
That scar!

45
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,628
My name is not one worth stating.

46
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,301
I walk the streets of Kyoto,
dreaming of a new age

47
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:06,537
when the Emperor reigns supreme.

48
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:08,639
Bakkyusai the Killer.

49
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:14,311
I am he!

50
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:19,850
What nerve!

51
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,986
We will cut you down!

52
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:23,287
Have at him!

53
00:08:25,223 --> 00:08:27,693
Why is Battosai the villain?

54
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:31,229
"Bakkyusai", not "Battosai."

55
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,530
Bakkyusai?

56
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:53,985
Hang in there!

57
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:11,204
Asakusa, Tokyo

58
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:31,624
You're an old legend now, "Battosai."

59
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:04,291
Invigorate the Heart

60
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:12,299
Step in!

61
00:10:18,606 --> 00:10:19,974
Hit him first!

62
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,445
Watch him!

63
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:25,513
Harder!

64
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:29,015
Shout out!

65
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,801
We have returned.

66
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:47,703
We're back!

67
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:49,805
Hello.

68
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:51,205
Sensei!

69
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:55,844
Why won't you teach us?

70
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:58,013
You're why we came here!

71
00:10:58,014 --> 00:10:59,514
Please!

72
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:03,319
You're mistaken.
I am merely a guest here.

73
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,653
I am no master of fencing.

74
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:06,854
But...

75
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:10,225
The way of the sword has changed.

76
00:11:10,993 --> 00:11:14,896
The motto of the Kamiya Dojo
is "invigorate the heart."

77
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:19,567
In this new age,
that is what the sword must teach you.

78
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:26,008
If it's a fight you want,
Street-fightin' Sanosuke's your man!

79
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:27,575
I don't charge much.

80
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:29,845
Well?

81
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,681
What do you say?

82
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:34,182
You want to fight?

83
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:37,085
Why not show them some stuff?

84
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:43,258
These days of peace have no need
for my High Heaven style.

85
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,027
Kenshin!

86
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:46,095
Miss Megumi!

87
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:49,365
How's the clinic?
Business good?

88
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:53,235
Doctors don't talk about
"good business," you oaf!

89
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:55,071
I'll get dinner ready.

90
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:57,106
Wait. You have visitors.

91
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:03,446
You're Mr. Himura?

92
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:06,249
What would you like?

93
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,450
I'm Superintendent Kawaji.

94
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:13,389
Someone wishes to talk with you.
Would you come with me?

95
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,894
Hey! We're just getting ready
for dinner here.

96
00:12:17,895 --> 00:12:21,297
Who sent you to come
waltzing in here like this?

97
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:25,469
Toshimichi Okubo, the Home Minister.

98
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,104
Who's that?

99
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:29,973
The top man in the government, that's who.

100
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:36,279
Don't go. It'll just be trouble.

101
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:38,316
Hey...

102
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,452
If he goes, I come with him.

103
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:46,289
I don't trust you guys
in the new government.

104
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:52,997
Fine.

105
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:54,498
Come with us.

106
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:01,305
I won't be long.

107
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:14,818
Home Ministry

108
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:18,823
Excuse us.

109
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,802
It's been a long time, Mr. Okubo.

110
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:35,340
At last we meet again.

111
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:37,508
You know him?

112
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:41,980
I'll come straight to the point.

113
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:45,549
What is it?

114
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,055
Shishio is plotting in Kyoto.

115
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,859
Shishio? Who's that?

116
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,464
Another assassin.

117
00:13:58,465 --> 00:13:59,699
What?

118
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,335
The successor to Battosai the Killer.

119
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:10,176
When you laid down your sword
at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi,

120
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:14,247
he was fighting there, too.

121
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,984
He was one of our assassins.

122
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:40,541
In speed, skills, and quick thinking,
he was a match for you.

123
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:44,878
However, unlike you,

124
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,917
he cared nothing for the weak,
or for those with him.

125
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:52,619
Victory!

126
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:55,255
It's the Emperor's banner!

127
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:02,462
We've won!

128
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:13,941
Ruthless ambition.

129
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:20,080
A wish to rule for which
he will trample over anyone.

130
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:23,117
That's Shishio.

131
00:15:26,087 --> 00:15:28,755
I've won!

132
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,105
Well done!

133
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:45,806
We won!

134
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:47,109
Thanks to you!

135
00:15:47,975 --> 00:15:49,777
You did it!

136
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:50,946
Well done!

137
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:57,518
You bastards!

138
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:06,293
Bastards!

139
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:15,837
You bastards!

140
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:19,273
Some of his assassinations were so brutal

141
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:23,378
they would have brought discredit
on the new government.

142
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:26,548
We had to eliminate him.

143
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:32,654
You put down your sword,
and his body was burned.

144
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:07,023
He should have died, but then it snowed...

145
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:22,267
He's alive?

146
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:26,270
He disappeared into the Kyoto underworld.

147
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:32,009
He's taken in a bunch of
bloodthirsty mercenaries

148
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,445
and formed his own private army.

149
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,781
He has one aim in mind,

150
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,188
to overthrow the new government.

151
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,124
Wait a minute!

152
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,862
He hates the government for a reason.
Why drag Kenshin into this?

153
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:55,200
He's destroyed every force
we've sent against him!

154
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:00,840
The only one we can turn to

155
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,209
is you.

156
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,681
Mr. Okubo,

157
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,720
you look worn out.

158
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,393
Building the new age

159
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:27,133
is much harder work
than destroying the old one.

160
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:28,968
Enrich the country, strengthen the military

161
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:34,740
I don't expect an immediate answer
to a request like this.

162
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,746
Will you take a week and think about it?

163
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,917
So, on May 14th, one week from today,

164
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:49,556
I hope you'll say yes.

165
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,364
That's crazy!

166
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,434
They want Kenshin to assassinate him?

167
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,102
It's not my idea!

168
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:07,941
They want Kenshin to clean up the mess

169
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,876
that they've made!

170
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:10,911
Bastards!

171
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,913
Not only that.

172
00:20:13,448 --> 00:20:17,750
You will, of course, be well-rewarded.

173
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:22,256
And there are certain illegalities
we are prepared to overlook.

174
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:24,691
For example,

175
00:20:24,692 --> 00:20:28,461
Megumi Takani's acquittal
on an opium charge.

176
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:30,097
That's bullshit!

177
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:34,768
If that's how they're pressuring him,
they can hang me first!

178
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,738
Tell me about it!

179
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:44,311
I won't let you go to Kyoto.

180
00:20:59,494 --> 00:21:02,997
Kioicho, Tokyo

181
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:08,938
May 14

182
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:29,290
Without Himura, the nation is lost.

183
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:07,497
How do you do?

184
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:08,498
What the...

185
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:14,403
I have a message from Mr. Shishio.

186
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:20,210
"If you're thinking of sending
Battosai Himura against me,

187
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:21,577
"don't waste your time.

188
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,584
"This land will be mine."

189
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:47,238
There! Now it's clean.

190
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:49,774
Is this the time for laundry?

191
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:54,577
Tell them to take that job and shove it.

192
00:22:54,578 --> 00:22:58,114
You really hate
the new government, don't you?

193
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,785
I hate people like that.

194
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:10,795
Kenshin?

195
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:14,965
I'm going to Mr. Okubo's now.

196
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,970
Yahiko, will you hang these out?

197
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:24,642
Maybe I'll come, too.

198
00:23:24,643 --> 00:23:28,479
No, it might get complicated.

199
00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:30,647
I'm best alone.

200
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,835
He's chosen life as a wanderer
who never kills.

201
00:23:51,637 --> 00:23:54,138
He won't leave you and go to Kyoto.

202
00:23:58,076 --> 00:23:59,245
Here he comes.

203
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:01,380
Let's go.

204
00:24:02,981 --> 00:24:05,117
Ichiro Shimada, samurai!

205
00:24:05,118 --> 00:24:06,985
Tsurahide Cho, samurai!

206
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:08,254
Villains!

207
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,864
Someone got here before us!

208
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:24,804
Okubo!

209
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:43,222
Mr. Okubo...

210
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:58,906
There were men planning to assassinate him.

211
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:03,410
We used that.

212
00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:19,427
Was he one of Shishio's men?

213
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:23,097
This is how Shishio works!

214
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:29,269
He wreaks havoc using what he learns
from spies he has everywhere.

215
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,439
You never see his hand!

216
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:35,776
He'll whittle away at us

217
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:39,447
until the day he rises up.

218
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:46,954
Come with me.

219
00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:06,974
Who are they?

220
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:11,813
Officers Shishio killed.

221
00:26:14,483 --> 00:26:16,152
He's taunting us.

222
00:26:16,818 --> 00:26:22,157
He sent them last night,
as if to coincide with today.

223
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:31,393
I will repeat Mr. Okubo's request.

224
00:27:32,395 --> 00:27:35,065
You are our only hope.

225
00:27:39,903 --> 00:27:42,573
Japan is about to lose its way.

226
00:27:44,075 --> 00:27:46,177
Shishio will seize his chance.

227
00:27:49,248 --> 00:27:50,413
It's war.

228
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:53,417
See you in Kyoto.

229
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:13,104
Extra! Extra!

230
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:15,506
Lord Okubo assassinated!

231
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:19,443
The Home Minister's been assassinated!

232
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:37,796
Assassins Kill Home Minister Okubo!

233
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:50,810
You're back.

234
00:28:51,644 --> 00:28:54,212
Shishio did that.

235
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:05,324
We cannot let him go on.
I will go to Kyoto.

236
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,835
To kill

237
00:29:18,838 --> 00:29:20,172
Shishio?

238
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,012
Even when you found out

239
00:29:30,183 --> 00:29:33,353
I was Battosai the Killer,

240
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,855
you let me stay at your dojo.

241
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:42,796
That made me

242
00:29:45,031 --> 00:29:46,198
very happy.

243
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:56,276
But to those who hate the likes of
Shishio or Battosai,

244
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:59,211
Battosai is who I remain.

245
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:03,048
But why?

246
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:07,720
Why do you have to go?

247
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:12,725
What do you care
if he hates the government?

248
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,562
Stay here.

249
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:23,636
Eat with us, practice
with us, laugh with us.

250
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:30,577
When I swore off killing,
Shishio took my place.

251
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,847
It is my job to stop him.

252
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:41,722
If you go,

253
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,028
you might fall back into killing.

254
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,434
No one can throw away

255
00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:57,271
his past.

256
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,452
Thank you

257
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:17,458
and goodbye.

258
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:22,097
Once again,

259
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:26,434
I will be a wanderer.

260
00:31:57,601 --> 00:31:59,468
That son of a bitch!

261
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:01,604
Damn him!

262
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:02,639
I'll help.

263
00:32:04,107 --> 00:32:07,976
He took off alone and left me!

264
00:32:08,778 --> 00:32:10,814
He doesn't want anyone in his way.

265
00:32:12,517 --> 00:32:14,017
What?

266
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:17,287
Who'd be in whose way?

267
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:20,989
Don't start yelling at us!

268
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:23,492
That's not what I meant.

269
00:32:26,663 --> 00:32:29,833
Kaoru! Why are you acting
like nothing's wrong?

270
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:32,701
Kaoru!

271
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:36,973
Of course she's upset, stupid!

272
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:42,680
You too, Yahiko!

273
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:44,681
Smarten up!

274
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:49,819
You shut up!

275
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,355
Damn it!

276
00:32:53,991 --> 00:32:56,693
Hey! Come back here!

277
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:09,239
This is bullshit!

278
00:33:10,576 --> 00:33:12,242
Damn him!

279
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:14,744
Damn it!

280
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,250
What do you want?

281
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:23,922
Battosai Himura.

282
00:33:25,257 --> 00:33:28,759
Word is there's someone
like him around here.

283
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,097
There's no Battosai here.
Out of my way.

284
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,279
Perfect!

285
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:50,948
You want trouble?

286
00:33:51,451 --> 00:33:53,285
You found it.

287
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:55,287
Where is Battosai?

288
00:33:55,954 --> 00:33:59,124
Take me and I'll tell you.

289
00:34:08,634 --> 00:34:10,301
Sanosuke!

290
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:19,378
Sanosuke!

291
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:45,337
Tell me before you pass out.

292
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:48,174
Let me think...

293
00:35:08,195 --> 00:35:09,196
Stop it!

294
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:25,712
Where is Battosai?

295
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:27,715
Tell me!

296
00:35:29,684 --> 00:35:33,387
I'm just a passing doctor. I don't know.

297
00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:53,575
Odawara, on the Tokaido Highway

298
00:36:06,222 --> 00:36:07,689
He's got a sword!

299
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,424
They were banned years ago!

300
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:03,113
Battosai's passed Odawara.

301
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,482
He'll come through the village.

302
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:07,483
Probably.

303
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:15,991
Let's arrange a welcome.

304
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:23,394
Could I have my sword back?

305
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,732
How?

306
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:32,069
It's of no use to anyone but me.

307
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,238
Yeah, sure!

308
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:37,910
If you're still keeping it
now that swords are illegal,

309
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:40,745
that means it's valuable.

310
00:39:02,536 --> 00:39:03,602
Hold it!

311
00:39:05,405 --> 00:39:07,071
Give me that!

312
00:39:07,072 --> 00:39:08,941
But it's my sword!

313
00:39:15,449 --> 00:39:17,450
Give it to me, I said!

314
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:38,571
Wait!

315
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,909
Please tell me

316
00:39:44,612 --> 00:39:45,812
why you want it.

317
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,493
Excuse me.

318
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:06,665
This sword is a back-blade.

319
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:13,840
Only the back of the blade is sharp.

320
00:40:19,146 --> 00:40:22,850
So the front won't cut?

321
00:40:26,153 --> 00:40:28,022
My scabbard?

322
00:40:34,996 --> 00:40:36,364
I thank you.

323
00:40:37,164 --> 00:40:40,167
Who are you, anyway?

324
00:40:40,168 --> 00:40:42,669
I am a mere wanderer.

325
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,372
Why is a girl stealing swords?

326
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:49,176
To pay for a journey.

327
00:40:49,177 --> 00:40:51,779
That is no reason to steal.

328
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,381
Keep your advice!

329
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:55,383
Who's there?

330
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,861
Help!

331
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:12,200
Help!

332
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:14,569
Help my brother!

333
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:17,072
Brother!

334
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:23,578
Brother!

335
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:32,921
Save our village.

336
00:41:33,556 --> 00:41:35,424
What happened?

337
00:41:38,094 --> 00:41:44,265
I'm a constable.
I lost contact with my home village.

338
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:48,937
I went to see what was wrong.

339
00:41:52,742 --> 00:41:56,111
Shishio found out who I was.

340
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:03,285
Eiji.

341
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,455
Brother!

342
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:16,765
Take care of him, will you?

343
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:17,799
Here's water.

344
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,239
Brother!

345
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:26,308
Brother!

346
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,645
Brother!

347
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,149
Brother!

348
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,158
This way.

349
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:30,674
Dad!

350
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,614
Mom!

351
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:47,891
Dad! Mom!

352
00:44:00,572 --> 00:44:01,973
Animals!

353
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:04,543
Those animals!

354
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:09,681
Dad!

355
00:44:09,682 --> 00:44:11,250
Mom!

356
00:44:19,425 --> 00:44:20,426
Animals!

357
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:22,761
Animals!

358
00:44:22,762 --> 00:44:24,095
Dad!

359
00:44:24,931 --> 00:44:26,431
Mom!

360
00:44:40,181 --> 00:44:42,614
You killed my mom and dad!

361
00:44:42,615 --> 00:44:44,718
I'll kill you!

362
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:50,556
Who are you?

363
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,728
You want to die, too?

364
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:06,306
Are you Shishio's men?

365
00:45:06,307 --> 00:45:07,973
What if we are?

366
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:11,044
Why did you kill those two?

367
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:18,318
Their son was going to tell the world
about this village.

368
00:45:20,222 --> 00:45:24,992
They took the blame.
The penalty is death.

369
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,162
As an example?

370
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:35,670
Watch the boy.

371
00:45:37,172 --> 00:45:38,504
Kill him!

372
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:09,598
Let's bury them.

373
00:47:14,103 --> 00:47:15,104
Wait!

374
00:47:18,509 --> 00:47:19,942
Leave them.

375
00:47:21,778 --> 00:47:26,283
If we cut them down, we will anger Shishio.

376
00:47:27,117 --> 00:47:30,687
We'll be helpless before him.

377
00:47:31,188 --> 00:47:34,624
What are you talking about?
They're from your village!

378
00:47:35,226 --> 00:47:39,196
They should never have gone
against Shishio!

379
00:47:40,697 --> 00:47:42,465
No! Don't do it!

380
00:47:43,101 --> 00:47:44,301
Mom!

381
00:47:46,771 --> 00:47:48,805
Mom! Mom!

382
00:47:50,307 --> 00:47:51,575
Mom!

383
00:47:53,311 --> 00:47:54,645
Mom!

384
00:47:59,818 --> 00:48:02,319
Dad! Dad!

385
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:07,325
Dad! Dad!

386
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:16,500
Dad! Mom!

387
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:19,769
So this is the world that Shishio wants...

388
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:43,193
Very well done!
Taking all these men by yourself.

389
00:48:44,496 --> 00:48:46,030
So the stories are true,

390
00:48:46,998 --> 00:48:48,700
Battosai Himura.

391
00:48:50,503 --> 00:48:51,537
Himura?

392
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,873
"Battosai?"

393
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,209
Mr. Shishio calls.

394
00:49:16,228 --> 00:49:17,796
Mr. Shishio! Please!

395
00:49:37,851 --> 00:49:41,421
This sword deserves its reputation.

396
00:49:42,054 --> 00:49:43,422
It cuts.

397
00:49:52,432 --> 00:49:54,100
Your visitor is here.

398
00:50:05,914 --> 00:50:07,948
You're Shishio?

399
00:50:10,217 --> 00:50:15,455
At least say "mister,"
even if you had the job first.

400
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:19,627
Why this village?

401
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:26,966
You want the whole country,
not a few small places.

402
00:50:28,603 --> 00:50:31,939
The hot spring here is good for my skin.

403
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:37,311
But without bandages, I scare people away.

404
00:50:38,947 --> 00:50:40,814
So to spare them that,

405
00:50:42,117 --> 00:50:44,318
I made the village mine.

406
00:50:46,121 --> 00:50:47,888
Damn you.

407
00:50:47,889 --> 00:50:51,792
Don't be mad. I'm just kidding.

408
00:50:51,793 --> 00:50:53,326
It's a joke.

409
00:50:54,463 --> 00:50:58,667
Is this revenge for what
the government did?

410
00:51:00,302 --> 00:51:05,340
I don't care about revenge now.
Far from it. I'm grateful.

411
00:51:06,442 --> 00:51:09,643
My injuries taught me a lot.

412
00:51:09,644 --> 00:51:14,482
Trust, and you'll be betrayed.
Drop your guard, and you die.

413
00:51:14,483 --> 00:51:18,018
Kill first, before they kill you.

414
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:23,857
The strong survive, and the weak die.

415
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:27,362
Reality, plain and simple.

416
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:35,203
I will make this country strong.

417
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:39,374
That is the justice I will bring.

418
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:41,676
Soon the whole land...

419
00:51:41,677 --> 00:51:45,046
It is not you who sheds blood for justice.

420
00:51:53,356 --> 00:51:55,725
Draw, Makoto Shishio.

421
00:51:57,893 --> 00:52:00,395
I won't allow any more bloodshed

422
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:06,069
for this thing you call justice.

423
00:52:21,018 --> 00:52:24,888
Sojiro, play with him for me.

424
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:26,890
May I?

425
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,863
In that case, I don't mind if I do.

426
00:52:37,369 --> 00:52:39,235
What's that sword?

427
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:42,071
I'm disappointed.

428
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:48,245
I'll see you in Kyoto.
Come back as the real killer.

429
00:52:51,115 --> 00:52:52,582
You're running away?

430
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,419
That's not nice.

431
00:52:56,054 --> 00:53:00,091
Stick around and let's play.
Mr. Shishio says we can.

432
00:53:37,096 --> 00:53:38,462
What's so funny?

433
00:53:39,498 --> 00:53:41,765
Nothing's funny.

434
00:53:41,766 --> 00:53:42,968
Nothing.

435
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,495
It's a battle of technique.

436
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:17,336
They're both equally fast.

437
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:23,508
What will decide the outcome
is that one is happy to kill

438
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:27,180
and one is not.

439
00:55:00,248 --> 00:55:03,417
Look what you did to this sword!

440
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:18,598
Have a new sword ready
for the next time we meet.

441
00:56:23,432 --> 00:56:26,334
Now's your chance!

442
00:56:26,335 --> 00:56:30,505
Take revenge for your mother and father!

443
00:56:31,673 --> 00:56:32,841
No!

444
00:56:33,342 --> 00:56:35,676
Stop it!

445
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:43,018
Kill them!

446
00:56:54,931 --> 00:56:59,034
You will please no one
by soiling those little hands.

447
00:57:03,172 --> 00:57:09,044
The dead wish only that
the living be happy.

448
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:16,719
In time, those little hands will grow big

449
00:57:18,188 --> 00:57:20,390
and you will be a man.

450
00:57:22,193 --> 00:57:28,398
Do not use your strength to oppress,
like those who serve Shishio.

451
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:37,239
And do not let fear make you helpless,
like these people of the village.

452
00:57:41,411 --> 00:57:44,747
Be a man who guards his family to the last,

453
00:57:47,385 --> 00:57:50,253
like your brother.

454
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:47,145
Look what he did
to a Kotetsu Nagasone sword.

455
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:51,982
I underestimated him.

456
00:58:52,784 --> 00:58:55,453
"Kotetsu Nagasone?"

457
00:58:55,454 --> 00:58:58,323
A swordsman like you doesn't know him?

458
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:04,663
Most people would give their eye teeth
to have a sword he made.

459
00:59:11,304 --> 00:59:12,337
That's good.

460
00:59:12,972 --> 00:59:14,674
Very good.

461
00:59:15,474 --> 00:59:16,508
Yes!

462
00:59:17,476 --> 00:59:19,845
Excellent!

463
00:59:21,313 --> 00:59:22,982
Welcome back, sir!

464
00:59:22,983 --> 00:59:25,351
Have you done what I wanted?

465
00:59:25,985 --> 00:59:28,854
We have all the weapons you asked for.

466
00:59:29,489 --> 00:59:30,522
Sojiro.

467
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:33,692
Do something for me.

468
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,662
Anything but pay for that sword.

469
00:59:36,663 --> 00:59:38,364
Summon the Ten Swords.

470
00:59:40,001 --> 00:59:41,201
What?

471
00:59:42,668 --> 00:59:45,370
You mean, at last?

472
00:59:47,507 --> 00:59:49,709
When they arrive,

473
00:59:55,016 --> 00:59:56,717
we go to war.

474
01:00:11,532 --> 01:00:13,066
I can't stand this.

475
01:00:15,036 --> 01:00:16,069
Stand what?

476
01:00:18,706 --> 01:00:20,574
Get down to Kyoto.

477
01:00:22,043 --> 01:00:23,910
Stop pretending.

478
01:00:26,713 --> 01:00:28,582
I'm not pretending.

479
01:00:30,885 --> 01:00:33,254
It is my opinion as a doctor

480
01:00:34,889 --> 01:00:38,925
that while everyone might think
Kenshin is invulnerable,

481
01:00:39,561 --> 01:00:44,599
I think he is a gifted
athlete, but otherwise

482
01:00:45,432 --> 01:00:47,602
he's no different from us.

483
01:00:49,737 --> 01:00:53,441
Where one wound might easily heal

484
01:00:54,577 --> 01:00:57,111
multiple wounds add up.

485
01:00:58,914 --> 01:01:02,284
And Kenshin's battle
hasn't only just begun.

486
01:01:03,585 --> 01:01:07,788
There's more than guns or swords
that could kill him.

487
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:19,133
You'll regret it if you wait.

488
01:01:25,942 --> 01:01:27,142
I'm going.

489
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:30,979
He'll face more than just Shishio.

490
01:01:33,782 --> 01:01:36,118
But you're still hurt!

491
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:39,488
Quiet! I'll heal up on the road.

492
01:01:40,789 --> 01:01:42,325
I'll toughen up.

493
01:01:43,126 --> 01:01:44,327
Wait!

494
01:01:45,295 --> 01:01:47,162
Then take this.

495
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,667
An elixir.

496
01:01:56,472 --> 01:01:59,674
An old family recipe. Take it once a day.

497
01:02:00,476 --> 01:02:01,676
And this.

498
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,180
It's salve.

499
01:02:12,657 --> 01:02:15,191
Give Kenshin some, too.

500
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:18,861
Thanks.

501
01:02:22,331 --> 01:02:23,365
But,

502
01:02:25,936 --> 01:02:27,871
you bring it.

503
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:32,875
It's not my job to heal his wounds.

504
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:44,054
Right!

505
01:02:44,688 --> 01:02:45,721
Right!

506
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:48,225
I'm on my way!

507
01:03:08,746 --> 01:03:14,818
Kyoto

508
01:03:28,067 --> 01:03:29,935
Found you!

509
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:35,105
I almost lost you!

510
01:03:36,742 --> 01:03:39,110
Have you got a place to stay?

511
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:42,613
I know a good, cheap inn.

512
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,451
- No, thank you.
- Wait, wait, wait!

513
01:03:47,085 --> 01:03:50,756
I'm Misao Makimachi.
I'm not a villain.

514
01:03:50,757 --> 01:03:51,790
Trust me.

515
01:03:52,592 --> 01:03:53,592
Come on!

516
01:04:06,105 --> 01:04:07,805
There it is!

517
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:08,806
But...

518
01:04:10,943 --> 01:04:12,311
I'm back!

519
01:04:13,112 --> 01:04:14,613
Hey!

520
01:04:14,614 --> 01:04:16,614
A guest!

521
01:04:16,615 --> 01:04:17,950
Welcome!

522
01:04:17,951 --> 01:04:19,151
Elder?

523
01:04:21,554 --> 01:04:22,620
I'm back!

524
01:04:22,621 --> 01:04:24,122
Misao!

525
01:04:24,123 --> 01:04:25,390
Come here!

526
01:04:25,391 --> 01:04:26,825
I'll take your things.

527
01:04:27,626 --> 01:04:28,727
Don't be shy.

528
01:04:29,295 --> 01:04:30,328
But...

529
01:04:30,963 --> 01:04:32,964
He helped me out.

530
01:04:32,965 --> 01:04:35,301
Let him stay, all right?

531
01:04:35,302 --> 01:04:37,670
We'll charge through the nose!

532
01:04:38,972 --> 01:04:41,140
Just kidding!

533
01:04:41,141 --> 01:04:42,141
Hello.

534
01:04:43,311 --> 01:04:44,844
You're welcome here,

535
01:04:45,478 --> 01:04:47,680
Battosai Himura.

536
01:04:51,652 --> 01:04:52,685
Yes.

537
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,354
The Battosai Himura

538
01:04:56,989 --> 01:04:58,857
Aoshi's looking for.

539
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:15,876
Please...

540
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:19,346
You've had a long journey.

541
01:05:19,347 --> 01:05:20,714
Thank you.

542
01:05:21,682 --> 01:05:27,053
It's been ten years since
you were in Kyoto, Battosai.

543
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:37,631
I've always thought

544
01:05:37,632 --> 01:05:43,571
some day we would meet.

545
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:47,507
I never thought it would
be here, like this.

546
01:05:49,077 --> 01:05:50,178
You are?

547
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:54,082
I am a ninja, one of the Hidden Watchers

548
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:57,584
who was stationed with
the Kyoto Constabulary.

549
01:05:58,552 --> 01:06:00,553
So Miss Misao...

550
01:06:00,554 --> 01:06:01,756
Yes.

551
01:06:02,423 --> 01:06:07,261
The Shogunate assigned me
to gather information

552
01:06:07,896 --> 01:06:14,435
in the guise of an innkeeper,
as you see me now.

553
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:18,373
When all of you brought down the Shogun,

554
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:23,378
this became my living.

555
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,783
But there were those among
the Shogun's servants

556
01:06:29,284 --> 01:06:34,288
for whom the transition was not so easy.

557
01:06:44,134 --> 01:06:50,138
One of the Watchers
stationed outside Edo Castle

558
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,806
was Aoshi Shinomori.

559
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:03,084
You remember the two sides agreed
Edo Castle would be surrendered

560
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:08,490
and there would be no bloodshed
in Edo itself.

561
01:07:10,161 --> 01:07:13,296
Had that not happened,

562
01:07:13,297 --> 01:07:16,832
you would probably have encountered him.

563
01:07:17,668 --> 01:07:21,504
You were the two champions of each side.

564
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:30,179
The Watchers were given
no opportunity to fight.

565
01:07:31,682 --> 01:07:33,817
And to make sure we wouldn't,
the Shogun's men...

566
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:41,991
Why are you doing this to us?

567
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:47,763
Intruder!

568
01:07:49,934 --> 01:07:54,471
Even though the new government
had offered him a post,

569
01:07:55,373 --> 01:08:00,477
Aoshi still tried to save his men
from death at the Shogun's hands.

570
01:08:04,815 --> 01:08:06,349
Captain!

571
01:08:09,286 --> 01:08:12,188
So the victors write the history?

572
01:08:14,126 --> 01:08:17,694
And we're flung into the dark?

573
01:08:17,695 --> 01:08:18,895
Ryujo!

574
01:08:18,896 --> 01:08:20,631
Shoot them!

575
01:08:22,534 --> 01:08:24,201
Captain! Live on!

576
01:08:26,971 --> 01:08:29,906
Long live the Watchers!

577
01:08:34,512 --> 01:08:38,416
Long may our name live!

578
01:08:46,891 --> 01:08:51,162
With no companions to preserve,
or Shogunate to hate,

579
01:08:52,265 --> 01:08:55,267
all of his anger and despair

580
01:08:55,268 --> 01:09:01,572
turned on Battosai Himura,
the greatest fighter of the age.

581
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:12,117
He aims to kill you

582
01:09:12,786 --> 01:09:16,522
and, before the graves
of his dead comrades,

583
01:09:16,523 --> 01:09:21,394
proclaim the Watchers as
the mightiest of all.

584
01:09:24,063 --> 01:09:25,764
And Miss Misao?

585
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:31,970
She doesn't know the demon he's become.

586
01:09:33,306 --> 01:09:36,808
She still pines for him.

587
01:09:42,548 --> 01:09:44,649
I understand.

588
01:09:45,452 --> 01:09:49,988
However, I have come to Kyoto

589
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:55,327
to put an end to Shishio.

590
01:09:56,296 --> 01:09:57,663
I see.

591
01:10:00,335 --> 01:10:06,340
After ten years,
Battosai comes back to Kyoto.

592
01:10:08,176 --> 01:10:11,511
I knew there had to be a reason.

593
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:19,518
The Hidden Watchers network
of informants remains in place.

594
01:10:20,188 --> 01:10:25,692
If you have need of us,
please do not hesitate to ask.

595
01:10:32,868 --> 01:10:34,602
I'll take you up on that.

596
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:37,871
Yes?

597
01:10:37,872 --> 01:10:39,874
Could you find someone for me?

598
01:10:49,885 --> 01:10:52,051
The father of this sword,

599
01:10:53,555 --> 01:10:55,055
Shakku Arai.

600
01:10:57,893 --> 01:10:59,727
Let's find him right away.

601
01:11:25,755 --> 01:11:27,422
Excuse us.

602
01:11:27,423 --> 01:11:29,758
Another guest.

603
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,761
Make yourself at home.

604
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:35,596
You're here?

605
01:11:38,435 --> 01:11:40,936
Everyone knows who you are.

606
01:11:52,114 --> 01:11:55,116
Takano, Kyoto Police.

607
01:11:58,287 --> 01:12:00,455
These are Shishio's villages.

608
01:12:02,292 --> 01:12:05,294
The government has abandoned
about a dozen.

609
01:12:05,962 --> 01:12:08,630
They're under Shishio's control.

610
01:12:14,471 --> 01:12:16,272
Where's the army?

611
01:12:16,273 --> 01:12:17,773
They could fix this!

612
01:12:17,774 --> 01:12:18,774
I'm afraid

613
01:12:19,976 --> 01:12:26,648
we cannot afford to show weakness
in the face of the Western powers.

614
01:12:26,649 --> 01:12:29,318
They're just all afraid

615
01:12:29,319 --> 01:12:32,154
they'll end up like Okubo.

616
01:12:32,155 --> 01:12:34,491
Then what do we do?

617
01:12:34,492 --> 01:12:38,161
The way we're going,
we play right into Shishio's hands.

618
01:12:41,664 --> 01:12:47,336
That's exactly the reason
we're all here now.

619
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:14,198
Permission to enter!

620
01:13:18,203 --> 01:13:20,038
That was quick.

621
01:13:20,872 --> 01:13:23,541
I only live over in Osaka.

622
01:13:26,377 --> 01:13:30,547
Take it easy here till the others arrive.

623
01:13:31,716 --> 01:13:32,716
Yumi...

624
01:13:38,858 --> 01:13:39,957
So?

625
01:13:40,525 --> 01:13:43,027
Where's Battosai now?

626
01:13:43,563 --> 01:13:45,228
Kyoto, we think.

627
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:49,733
Probably looking for a sword
to replace the one Sojiro broke.

628
01:13:50,735 --> 01:13:55,072
Battosai's sword would have come
from the best swordsmith.

629
01:13:55,675 --> 01:13:57,541
That means Shakku Arai.

630
01:13:57,542 --> 01:14:01,245
You can always depend on Cho
to know those things.

631
01:14:07,252 --> 01:14:10,421
Battosai's a bit of a fool, isn't he?

632
01:14:11,756 --> 01:14:15,093
Trying to get a dead man
to make him a sword.

633
01:14:32,445 --> 01:14:34,112
Shakku...

634
01:14:34,614 --> 01:14:37,782
Shakku Arai, d. 1870

635
01:14:38,284 --> 01:14:40,018
Himura!

636
01:14:42,256 --> 01:14:43,956
So you're going?

637
01:14:52,466 --> 01:14:55,969
Without killing anymore,
I will try to preserve

638
01:14:56,470 --> 01:15:00,140
those who seek to bring about a new age.

639
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:07,980
Well, if you find a way,
I sure hope you'll tell me.

640
01:15:12,987 --> 01:15:14,220
A farewell gift.

641
01:15:16,256 --> 01:15:19,492
Try being a swordsman
wearing one of those.

642
01:15:20,962 --> 01:15:25,832
Then you'll know
what you're saying is nonsense.

643
01:15:29,837 --> 01:15:31,072
The blade's

644
01:15:32,006 --> 01:15:33,239
on the back?

645
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:38,679
If your head's still full
of that nonsense when it breaks,

646
01:15:39,346 --> 01:15:43,283
come back to Kyoto and find me again.

647
01:16:12,847 --> 01:16:15,049
Seiku! Someone's here.

648
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:18,219
Coming.

649
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:24,026
Can I help you?

650
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,894
Mr. Seiku Arai?

651
01:16:27,563 --> 01:16:28,630
Yes.

652
01:16:29,164 --> 01:16:33,234
I owe your father a great
debt of gratitude.

653
01:16:35,003 --> 01:16:39,073
Learning he has passed away,
I have come with a request.

654
01:16:41,409 --> 01:16:44,746
Could you please make me a sword?

655
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:53,922
My father would often say

656
01:16:55,259 --> 01:16:58,594
how his swords would create a new age.

657
01:17:01,097 --> 01:17:07,269
But the truth is that
those swords took many lives.

658
01:17:14,444 --> 01:17:18,948
You can say it was the times,
and it had to be that way

659
01:17:20,449 --> 01:17:23,118
but this is the new age.

660
01:17:24,121 --> 01:17:26,455
Killing to change the world...

661
01:17:27,891 --> 01:17:32,629
The new age no longer requires
those weapons or that logic.

662
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:41,304
Now I make kitchen knives
or things for everyday use.

663
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:47,810
I'm sorry, but I will never make
another sword.

664
01:17:53,551 --> 01:17:54,818
Very well.

665
01:17:56,654 --> 01:17:58,155
I'm sorry to bother you.

666
01:18:24,483 --> 01:18:27,017
Wow! So this is Kyoto!

667
01:18:34,092 --> 01:18:35,193
Hey!

668
01:18:35,194 --> 01:18:36,861
Stop leering!

669
01:18:36,862 --> 01:18:38,795
That hurt!

670
01:18:38,796 --> 01:18:41,698
Save that for when you grow up.

671
01:18:41,699 --> 01:18:43,100
I'm just looking!

672
01:18:43,101 --> 01:18:47,371
We're here to find Kenshin,
so get looking for him.

673
01:18:47,372 --> 01:18:49,039
Yeah, I know.

674
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:53,879
Windmills for sale!

675
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:59,217
Windmills! Come and get one!

676
01:18:59,719 --> 01:19:00,786
Look!

677
01:19:02,389 --> 01:19:06,457
Windmills! Windmills for sale!

678
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:21,739
Hey!

679
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:25,211
What are you doing?

680
01:19:25,212 --> 01:19:26,412
What's wrong?

681
01:19:29,048 --> 01:19:31,082
I'm just playing with him.

682
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:32,250
What's the problem?

683
01:19:33,753 --> 01:19:35,420
He's got lori!

684
01:19:42,095 --> 01:19:43,261
Who would you be?

685
01:19:44,597 --> 01:19:46,933
Do you wish something of me?

686
01:19:49,936 --> 01:19:52,904
You're Shakku Arai's son Seiku?

687
01:19:54,442 --> 01:19:56,608
Rumor has it

688
01:19:57,278 --> 01:20:00,613
that you've still got
the last sword your dad made.

689
01:20:01,782 --> 01:20:04,451
No one's ever used it, right?

690
01:20:07,956 --> 01:20:09,456
Can I see it?

691
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:21,801
What's wrong?

692
01:20:21,802 --> 01:20:22,803
Mr. Himura!

693
01:20:23,404 --> 01:20:24,470
The police!

694
01:20:24,471 --> 01:20:26,139
Get the police!

695
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:27,474
Our baby!

696
01:20:27,475 --> 01:20:28,976
Our baby!

697
01:20:29,478 --> 01:20:32,144
Calm down, will you!

698
01:20:40,154 --> 01:20:42,490
Come on now! Don't cry!

699
01:20:43,324 --> 01:20:45,658
I'll shut you up soon enough.

700
01:20:58,006 --> 01:20:59,506
Who are you?

701
01:21:00,574 --> 01:21:02,175
Give back the child.

702
01:21:04,345 --> 01:21:08,181
Two scars crossed on your left cheek...

703
01:21:09,518 --> 01:21:11,853
So you're the famous killer,

704
01:21:12,654 --> 01:21:14,522
Battosai Himura?

705
01:21:17,192 --> 01:21:19,193
I hear your sword broke.

706
01:21:20,029 --> 01:21:24,032
So you're here for
Shakku's last sword, too?

707
01:21:25,534 --> 01:21:26,867
What do you mean?

708
01:21:29,204 --> 01:21:33,041
You mean you don't care if I step in here?

709
01:21:33,042 --> 01:21:34,543
Then get lost.

710
01:21:35,211 --> 01:21:37,212
Give back the child.

711
01:21:38,381 --> 01:21:39,714
Why?

712
01:21:40,649 --> 01:21:45,553
If I get his last sword
but I can't try it out,

713
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:48,891
where's the fun in that?

714
01:22:32,569 --> 01:22:35,104
There's a fight going on!

715
01:22:35,105 --> 01:22:36,773
Fight!

716
01:22:36,774 --> 01:22:38,273
Call the police!

717
01:22:38,274 --> 01:22:40,776
Aw, just leave them.

718
01:22:41,278 --> 01:22:43,446
What's going on?

719
01:22:43,447 --> 01:22:46,517
Some ex-samurais are fighting
over in that shrine.

720
01:22:46,518 --> 01:22:48,618
You'd better keep away!

721
01:22:51,622 --> 01:22:52,622
Come on!

722
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,295
Draw your damn sword!

723
01:23:13,945 --> 01:23:16,147
You're good, I'll give you that.

724
01:23:17,048 --> 01:23:20,818
But this prize is going to cost you!

725
01:23:38,436 --> 01:23:39,970
Iori!

726
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:40,971
Stay back!

727
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:46,178
Are we done?

728
01:23:47,512 --> 01:23:51,015
You're going to risk your life
just to save one kid?

729
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,702
What's that look?

730
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:12,871
You're pissing me off!

731
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:16,542
I killed many

732
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:21,446
to bring about a new age.

733
01:24:23,382 --> 01:24:25,049
Are you bragging?

734
01:24:25,551 --> 01:24:27,385
Be my guest.

735
01:24:27,386 --> 01:24:31,389
Go ahead and cling to
the glories of the past.

736
01:24:32,559 --> 01:24:34,559
What a loser!

737
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:39,397
Ten years since struggle and blood
brought us to a new age.

738
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:45,403
Now, in a happy home
that knows nothing of war,

739
01:24:47,573 --> 01:24:52,077
we begin to see a time of peace
in which to raise its children.

740
01:24:54,081 --> 01:25:00,586
Think what you will, but that child
is the blessing of the new age.

741
01:25:15,101 --> 01:25:17,770
If it costs me my life,

742
01:25:21,775 --> 01:25:24,111
I will take him back.

743
01:25:34,288 --> 01:25:36,622
A real hero of justice, huh?

744
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:44,798
My father's last killing swords!

745
01:26:07,088 --> 01:26:10,157
Wait, lori! Just a little bit longer!

746
01:26:21,502 --> 01:26:22,670
I'll take the chance!

747
01:26:23,338 --> 01:26:26,506
If anyone can put that sword
to good use, it's him!

748
01:27:03,881 --> 01:27:06,547
Father! Watch over us!

749
01:27:35,179 --> 01:27:36,313
Damn you!

750
01:28:23,295 --> 01:28:24,528
Kenshin!

751
01:28:24,529 --> 01:28:25,964
That hurt!

752
01:28:27,565 --> 01:28:28,966
Who's that?

753
01:28:28,967 --> 01:28:30,134
Where's his sword?

754
01:28:33,805 --> 01:28:36,139
Mr. Himura! Take this!

755
01:28:50,221 --> 01:28:54,125
It's my father's last sword! Use it!

756
01:28:56,996 --> 01:28:59,162
So there was one!

757
01:28:59,998 --> 01:29:02,000
That sword will be mine!

758
01:29:06,572 --> 01:29:07,605
Draw.

759
01:29:08,507 --> 01:29:13,178
We'll have a real fight.
Let's see who wins.

760
01:29:22,354 --> 01:29:27,191
Well? You're Battosai
the Killer, aren't you?

761
01:29:28,194 --> 01:29:31,531
My sword's out. Where's yours?

762
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:39,372
Fine! If you've forgotten
how good killing feels.

763
01:29:40,039 --> 01:29:42,041
I'll remind you.

764
01:29:42,943 --> 01:29:45,044
I'll do one right now!

765
01:29:45,045 --> 01:29:46,045
Iori!

766
01:29:46,712 --> 01:29:47,879
Iori!

767
01:29:48,381 --> 01:29:49,714
Wait there.

768
01:29:50,216 --> 01:29:52,884
I'll cut you into pieces.

769
01:29:55,055 --> 01:29:56,788
No killing!

770
01:30:08,368 --> 01:30:09,736
You know,

771
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:14,073
you're really good.

772
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:19,746
Iori!

773
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:22,416
Iori!

774
01:30:24,217 --> 01:30:25,751
Iori!

775
01:30:30,492 --> 01:30:31,658
Kenshin...

776
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:40,701
Kenshin?

777
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:56,783
He's not dead.

778
01:30:56,784 --> 01:31:00,453
Kaoru! He didn't kill him!

779
01:31:00,454 --> 01:31:02,122
That's a back-blade.

780
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:15,637
I'm glad!

781
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:22,477
Iori!

782
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:28,316
Iori!

783
01:31:29,318 --> 01:31:30,618
Iori!

784
01:31:32,488 --> 01:31:33,654
He's fine!

785
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:37,325
On your feet!

786
01:31:38,728 --> 01:31:39,827
Get him up!

787
01:31:42,398 --> 01:31:43,732
Bring him!

788
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:47,836
Walk!

789
01:31:48,572 --> 01:31:51,640
Kenshin! Are you okay?

790
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:55,678
Is that a new back-blade?

791
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:57,680
Hey...

792
01:32:01,184 --> 01:32:03,185
Hey, Kenshin...

793
01:32:06,922 --> 01:32:08,191
Kenshin...

794
01:33:20,899 --> 01:33:22,166
Seiku,

795
01:33:24,603 --> 01:33:26,002
what's this?

796
01:33:31,277 --> 01:33:33,443
The true back-blade.

797
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,614
"True?"

798
01:33:40,118 --> 01:33:42,952
The sword he made for the gods

799
01:33:44,456 --> 01:33:47,792
out of remorse, mixed
with a tiny bit of hope.

800
01:33:50,796 --> 01:33:55,299
When you dedicate a sword
to the gods, you forge two.

801
01:33:56,769 --> 01:33:59,805
The better one is "true."
You give that to the gods.

802
01:34:00,739 --> 01:34:06,644
The other one is the "shadow."
You let someone else have that.

803
01:34:07,646 --> 01:34:08,647
So...

804
01:34:10,983 --> 01:34:11,983
Yes.

805
01:34:13,485 --> 01:34:18,656
The one he gave you was the shadow.

806
01:34:24,663 --> 01:34:29,167
Have that sword.

807
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:35,506
Father would have wanted that.

808
01:34:51,824 --> 01:34:56,194
"Reluctantly, for years,
I have tempered swords.

809
01:34:57,797 --> 01:35:01,533
"Not for the world of my son,
but to bring peace for his child."

810
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,875
Kenshin, I'm coming in.

811
01:35:13,046 --> 01:35:15,047
Did you rest?

812
01:35:15,716 --> 01:35:16,950
Yeah.

813
01:35:16,951 --> 01:35:18,451
Right, Kaoru?

814
01:35:24,725 --> 01:35:25,892
Are you angry?

815
01:35:29,563 --> 01:35:32,566
About me following you to Kyoto?

816
01:35:35,904 --> 01:35:37,070
Half.

817
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:40,408
The other half

818
01:35:43,578 --> 01:35:44,745
relieved.

819
01:35:49,016 --> 01:35:51,585
Shishio's men are everywhere.

820
01:35:53,587 --> 01:35:55,589
Be very careful.

821
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:01,429
See? I told you.

822
01:36:02,096 --> 01:36:06,666
When a woman follows a man,
he acts like she's a pest,

823
01:36:06,667 --> 01:36:10,103
but he's still happy about it.

824
01:36:10,104 --> 01:36:14,107
You be quiet. You don't know
what you're talking about.

825
01:36:28,289 --> 01:36:29,791
Shakku,

826
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:36,797
I'm just like you.
My head's still full of nonsense.

827
01:36:40,435 --> 01:36:42,136
Thanks for coming out!

828
01:36:42,938 --> 01:36:44,939
I greet the Ten Swords!

829
01:36:46,109 --> 01:36:47,276
Hoji!

830
01:36:47,277 --> 01:36:48,643
Take charge.

831
01:36:57,319 --> 01:37:00,822
Tomorrow, at one minute to midnight,

832
01:37:02,257 --> 01:37:04,826
we make Kyoto an inferno!

833
01:37:13,604 --> 01:37:18,274
You hear that, comrades?
The time has come at last!

834
01:37:18,809 --> 01:37:22,010
Those lazy fools will feel

835
01:37:22,011 --> 01:37:24,078
our power to the full!

836
01:38:12,064 --> 01:38:14,398
You're Cho the Sword Hunter,

837
01:38:15,466 --> 01:38:17,533
one of Shishio's Ten Swords.

838
01:38:17,534 --> 01:38:18,902
Are you not?

839
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:24,407
So what's the big deal?

840
01:38:25,476 --> 01:38:27,143
What's he planning?

841
01:38:41,894 --> 01:38:44,761
Tell us and it'll go easier on you.

842
01:38:47,765 --> 01:38:51,435
It's time to stop being loyal to Shishio.

843
01:38:54,939 --> 01:39:00,944
What are you talking about?
I'm not loyal to Shishio.

844
01:39:02,515 --> 01:39:05,550
He was just a way to get where I wanted.

845
01:39:23,603 --> 01:39:25,804
The guy you beat up talked.

846
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:29,642
Shishio's burning Kyoto.

847
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:33,478
That's been planned before.

848
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:40,152
In the days of the Shogun,
when we raided the Ikedaya.

849
01:39:41,054 --> 01:39:44,122
We were in time to stop them.

850
01:39:44,123 --> 01:39:47,460
And Shishio wants to
try the same thing again?

851
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:52,665
Probably to prove that this government
can't stop them now.

852
01:39:53,801 --> 01:39:59,337
But why would Cho just tell you
something that important?

853
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:06,979
They're a bunch of hoodlums.
There's always one who'll talk.

854
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:11,017
It's set for tomorrow
at one minute to midnight.

855
01:40:41,882 --> 01:40:46,053
Shishio is plotting something
for the night of the waning moon.

856
01:40:47,354 --> 01:40:49,055
Sniff the wind.

857
01:40:51,192 --> 01:40:53,728
Kyoto, a sea of fire?

858
01:40:55,029 --> 01:40:56,563
If we allow it,

859
01:40:57,364 --> 01:40:59,399
many will die.

860
01:41:01,369 --> 01:41:05,406
We have deep roots here in Kyoto.

861
01:41:05,907 --> 01:41:08,576
He won't get away with it.

862
01:41:08,577 --> 01:41:11,379
Misao, send pigeons.

863
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:12,813
Tell all Kyoto.

864
01:41:12,814 --> 01:41:13,880
I will.

865
01:41:13,881 --> 01:41:15,483
Kurojo, Shirojo,

866
01:41:15,484 --> 01:41:17,085
Masugami, Omime.

867
01:41:18,087 --> 01:41:20,088
Dress for action.

868
01:41:22,891 --> 01:41:26,928
We'll show them what
the Hidden Watchers can do!

869
01:41:44,246 --> 01:41:45,781
The north side!

870
01:42:14,144 --> 01:42:15,812
Stay in your homes!

871
01:42:17,613 --> 01:42:20,749
Martial Law is declared for all of Kyoto!

872
01:43:56,548 --> 01:43:57,581
Kenshin!

873
01:44:01,421 --> 01:44:02,721
We'll fight, too.

874
01:44:04,423 --> 01:44:05,756
But...

875
01:44:05,757 --> 01:44:08,259
I made up my mind before I came.

876
01:44:09,694 --> 01:44:12,563
I'll see this through to the end.

877
01:44:12,564 --> 01:44:15,899
Me, too. You can see what I've learned.

878
01:44:20,573 --> 01:44:21,605
Let's go.

879
01:44:24,743 --> 01:44:26,611
Don't try too much.

880
01:44:32,618 --> 01:44:33,853
Stay with them.

881
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:39,792
This is a fight to the death.

882
01:44:41,462 --> 01:44:44,296
A fencing instructor won't help.

883
01:44:55,708 --> 01:44:58,577
Come and fight with us.

884
01:44:59,712 --> 01:45:00,745
Let's go.

885
01:45:16,797 --> 01:45:17,964
They're here.

886
01:45:30,677 --> 01:45:32,345
Take your positions.

887
01:45:46,261 --> 01:45:47,361
Sojiro.

888
01:45:48,195 --> 01:45:49,196
Yes?

889
01:45:50,364 --> 01:45:52,032
Remember my souvenir.

890
01:45:53,935 --> 01:45:54,968
I will.

891
01:46:05,881 --> 01:46:08,215
Set them off.

892
01:46:08,716 --> 01:46:09,883
Yes, sir.

893
01:47:50,954 --> 01:47:54,157
Everybody, be on your guard.

894
01:48:38,203 --> 01:48:40,205
Riflemen, forward!

895
01:48:49,381 --> 01:48:53,518
On your honor as police officers,
stop them in their tracks!

896
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:55,286
All right!

897
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:00,892
Burn the place!

898
01:49:02,627 --> 01:49:03,728
Fire!

899
01:49:15,407 --> 01:49:16,875
Police!

900
01:49:16,876 --> 01:49:18,544
Kill!

901
01:49:19,078 --> 01:49:20,412
Fire!

902
01:49:22,414 --> 01:49:23,482
Men!

903
01:49:23,483 --> 01:49:24,483
Charge!

904
01:51:26,809 --> 01:51:28,376
You're getting better.

905
01:51:28,377 --> 01:51:31,279
I am Yahiko Myojin, samurai of Tokyo!

906
01:51:38,554 --> 01:51:40,854
Bring fire!

907
01:51:40,855 --> 01:51:43,124
We know what you're planning!

908
01:51:57,372 --> 01:52:01,742
Thanks for coming out this late at night!

909
01:52:02,511 --> 01:52:06,580
Street-fightin' Sanosuke's in town!

910
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:38,381
He's back.

911
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:41,716
Go on ahead.

912
01:52:57,769 --> 01:52:59,402
Where's Battosai?

913
01:53:01,872 --> 01:53:06,642
I heard you're sheltering a man
with crossed scars on his cheek.

914
01:53:09,113 --> 01:53:15,319
You know how hard
Misao's been looking for you?

915
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:20,924
She still believes
you're the man you always were.

916
01:53:20,925 --> 01:53:22,826
That is of no concern.

917
01:53:23,795 --> 01:53:28,499
He is a valued guest here at the Aoiya.

918
01:53:31,804 --> 01:53:34,738
Hiding in plain sight, is he?

919
01:53:34,739 --> 01:53:38,009
Open your eyes, Aoshi.

920
01:53:39,744 --> 01:53:42,613
What you need is not battle.

921
01:53:44,082 --> 01:53:46,618
Calm your heart.

922
01:53:47,252 --> 01:53:49,120
The Shogunate lives!

923
01:54:29,628 --> 01:54:35,634
If you have abandoned
your honor as a Watcher

924
01:54:35,635 --> 01:54:39,404
to tread the path of blood and carnage...

925
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:56,854
I will crush you!

926
01:55:41,936 --> 01:55:43,237
Burn!

927
01:55:51,947 --> 01:55:53,313
No! No!

928
01:55:54,314 --> 01:55:55,581
Don't kill!

929
01:55:56,216 --> 01:55:57,584
Don't kill.

930
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:04,424
Are you okay?

931
01:56:26,082 --> 01:56:28,183
Fire! Put it out!

932
01:56:34,422 --> 01:56:35,689
We'll take over here.

933
01:56:36,358 --> 01:56:37,425
Please.

934
01:56:42,698 --> 01:56:44,031
Hold still.

935
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:02,783
Shishio!

936
01:57:24,407 --> 01:57:25,474
Decoys.

937
01:58:17,461 --> 01:58:19,129
Kenshin!

938
01:58:20,297 --> 01:58:21,297
Where are you?

939
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:27,136
Wait for me!

940
01:58:37,782 --> 01:58:40,818
Give me a fight, damn it!

941
01:58:42,121 --> 01:58:43,821
Misao!

942
01:58:45,056 --> 01:58:46,157
What?

943
01:58:46,158 --> 01:58:48,492
It's Elder and Aoshi!

944
01:58:48,993 --> 01:58:50,828
Aoshi's come back?

945
01:59:22,194 --> 01:59:24,028
Where's Battosai?

946
01:59:34,807 --> 01:59:36,707
That again?

947
02:00:11,578 --> 02:00:13,246
Aoshi!

948
02:00:13,247 --> 02:00:14,413
Stay back!

949
02:00:35,436 --> 02:00:36,937
Damn you, Aoshi.

950
02:00:41,443 --> 02:00:43,109
Is that how low

951
02:00:43,944 --> 02:00:48,281
you've sunk?

952
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:31,258
I am not the Aoshi you once knew.

953
02:02:29,052 --> 02:02:30,085
Hey!

954
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:35,191
All you underlings, get outta here!

955
02:02:45,869 --> 02:02:47,036
Sanosuke?

956
02:02:47,738 --> 02:02:48,872
Why are you here?

957
02:02:52,676 --> 02:02:53,709
"Why?"

958
02:02:54,679 --> 02:02:57,881
To help you out, stupid!

959
02:03:04,521 --> 02:03:05,889
Thank you.

960
02:03:12,029 --> 02:03:13,562
All right, then.

961
02:03:14,364 --> 02:03:16,966
Victory is ours!

962
02:03:16,967 --> 02:03:17,968
Who are they?

963
02:03:19,770 --> 02:03:21,071
Get them all!

964
02:03:23,373 --> 02:03:24,875
Himura!

965
02:03:24,876 --> 02:03:26,276
You again?

966
02:03:26,277 --> 02:03:28,545
Something's wrong here.

967
02:03:28,546 --> 02:03:30,046
Yes.

968
02:03:30,047 --> 02:03:32,883
Where's Shishio and his Ten Swords?

969
02:03:32,884 --> 02:03:35,719
Why are you two looking so down?

970
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:38,422
It's all been too easy.

971
02:03:39,725 --> 02:03:45,430
If he meant to burn Kyoto,
he'd be here to see it himself.

972
02:04:09,756 --> 02:04:12,123
Miss Kaoru Kamiya?

973
02:04:13,591 --> 02:04:14,625
Who are you?

974
02:04:17,462 --> 02:04:20,799
You mean Shishio's got
something else up his sleeve?

975
02:04:22,601 --> 02:04:28,607
At the Battle of Toba-Fushimi,
when the Shogun and the Emperor

976
02:04:28,608 --> 02:04:32,109
battled for rule over the land,

977
02:04:32,110 --> 02:04:37,982
Shogun Yoshinobu abandoned
his forces and fled by ship to Edo.

978
02:04:44,123 --> 02:04:48,160
Without that, the new government
never would have won.

979
02:04:48,962 --> 02:04:50,629
History changed course.

980
02:04:50,630 --> 02:04:56,468
If he can rewrite history,
he'll terrify the government.

981
02:04:56,469 --> 02:04:58,437
By spitting in their eye?

982
02:04:58,438 --> 02:05:01,172
Burning Kyoto is a first step.

983
02:05:01,975 --> 02:05:04,343
If he wants to retrace history...

984
02:05:06,145 --> 02:05:07,513
Just maybe...

985
02:05:10,317 --> 02:05:12,352
I'm going to bombard Tokyo

986
02:05:17,824 --> 02:05:20,527
and destroy the country!

987
02:05:23,831 --> 02:05:26,033
His real aim is Tokyo!

988
02:05:26,966 --> 02:05:27,966
Kenshin!

989
02:05:37,345 --> 02:05:38,879
Miss Kaoru!

990
02:06:14,115 --> 02:06:15,582
Where are you?

991
02:06:20,555 --> 02:06:21,922
Where are you?

992
02:06:24,393 --> 02:06:26,594
Where are you, Battosai?

993
02:06:29,398 --> 02:06:30,598
Where?

994
02:06:32,902 --> 02:06:34,434
Where?

995
02:06:36,070 --> 02:06:38,105
Battosai!

996
02:07:28,792 --> 02:07:29,792
Who are you?

997
02:07:41,137 --> 02:07:42,171
Stop!

998
02:07:51,481 --> 02:07:53,183
Well done!

999
02:07:54,150 --> 02:07:57,019
You saw that Kyoto was just a feint.

1000
02:07:57,654 --> 02:07:59,389
Where's Miss Kaoru?

1001
02:07:59,390 --> 02:08:03,225
What, you mean you're only here
for a woman?

1002
02:08:03,226 --> 02:08:05,696
Leave her out of this!

1003
02:08:06,329 --> 02:08:07,697
Whatever.

1004
02:08:08,832 --> 02:08:10,866
Miss Kaoru, you're on!

1005
02:08:15,105 --> 02:08:16,171
Miss Kaoru!

1006
02:08:16,172 --> 02:08:20,243
Come on, Yumi! Untie the poor girl.

1007
02:08:20,244 --> 02:08:21,377
Sure.

1008
02:08:22,413 --> 02:08:24,348
Have no fear! I will...

1009
02:08:24,349 --> 02:08:27,718
Stop talking like a damn samurai!

1010
02:08:31,023 --> 02:08:36,527
I want to see that killing spirit of yours.

1011
02:08:36,528 --> 02:08:39,230
It's me you want. Let her go.

1012
02:08:41,033 --> 02:08:43,067
This is the perfect chance

1013
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:48,572
to see once and for all who's the best.

1014
02:08:53,878 --> 02:08:55,211
Kenshin!

1015
02:08:55,212 --> 02:08:56,246
Hoji!

1016
02:08:56,849 --> 02:08:58,782
I'll burn her!

1017
02:08:58,783 --> 02:08:59,884
No!

1018
02:08:59,885 --> 02:09:04,121
It hurts when you burn.
So much you want to die.

1019
02:09:04,122 --> 02:09:05,389
No.

1020
02:09:05,390 --> 02:09:07,392
Yes!

1021
02:09:07,393 --> 02:09:10,095
It's that rage I want to see!

1022
02:09:11,396 --> 02:09:14,898
You want to kill me, right?

1023
02:09:14,899 --> 02:09:15,968
Try it.

1024
02:09:15,969 --> 02:09:17,068
Shut up.

1025
02:09:17,069 --> 02:09:20,237
No! Don't let him tempt you!

1026
02:09:20,238 --> 02:09:24,242
Curse yourself, curse the gods.

1027
02:09:24,243 --> 02:09:28,080
Curse Buddha, hate the times,
hate everything.

1028
02:09:28,081 --> 02:09:29,147
No!

1029
02:09:29,148 --> 02:09:31,383
Now you're looking good.

1030
02:09:37,591 --> 02:09:40,459
Shishio!

1031
02:09:45,264 --> 02:09:46,465
Kenshin!

1032
02:09:52,405 --> 02:09:53,471
Miss Kaoru!

1033
02:09:53,472 --> 02:09:56,175
Stay alive!

1034
02:10:02,782 --> 02:10:05,451
Watch, Battosai!

1035
02:10:19,498 --> 02:10:21,800
Is that all you got?

1036
02:10:21,801 --> 02:10:24,504
Can't the legendary Battosai
do better than that?

1037
02:10:36,984 --> 02:10:38,352
What?

1038
02:10:40,154 --> 02:10:43,689
The legend just wants
to play love-suicides?

1039
02:10:47,162 --> 02:10:48,362
Miss Kaoru!

1040
02:10:48,997 --> 02:10:50,529
Miss Kaoru!

1041
02:10:52,332 --> 02:10:53,700
Miss Kaoru!

1042
02:10:53,724 --> 02:12:53,724
