1
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:06,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}世界时刻变化，没人知道发生着什么，
The world is changing, now no one knows what's going,

2
00:00:06,468 --> 00:00:09,002
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}但是我们将到那里，揭示新闻，
but we'll be there, uncovering the news, 

3
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:10,602
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}文化
culture

4
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:12,002
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}政治
some politics.

5
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:15,702
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}并且曝光现代社会的荒谬之事。
and expose the absurdity of the modern condition.

6
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:18,702
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}那个孩子拿着一个很大的枪，
That little child had a huge gun.

7
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:20,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我之前从来没见过这种场面
I had never seen this just before.

8
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:22,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}看着像地球上的地狱
looks like a hell on Earth.

9
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:25,302
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}她们是人肉炸弹的自杀者，都是小孩。
They were the suicide bombers, they were kids.

10
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:27,402
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这是我们眼中观察的世界
This is the world through our eyes

11
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:31,702
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这是一个充满罪恶的世界。
This is the world of VICE.

12
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:42,602
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}嗨，我是 Shane Smith, 这里是纽约布鲁克林区的 
VICE 系列节目的演播室。
Hi, I'm Shane Smith, we're here in the VICE offices in Brooklyn New York.

13
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,602
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}中国经济正在成长。
China is booming.

14
00:00:45,868 --> 00:00:49,802
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}过去30年，中国经济一直保持着两位数的增涨速度。
It's economy has been growing with double digit growth for the last 3 decades.

15
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:55,902
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}事实上，据估计，中国会在 20年内超过美国，
成为世界上最大的经济体。
In fact, it's estimated that China will overtake the US as the world's largest economy in just 20 years.

16
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:59,602
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}但我们不知道的是，这个增涨的健康情况。
But what we don't know much about though, is the health of that growth.

17
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:05,902
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}有迹象表明，中国正在向 2008年震撼美国的房地产崩盘靠近。
There're signs that China is heading for the same kind of realistic collapse that rocked America in 2008.

18
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:11,602
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们派记者 Ryan Duffy 去看看世界上下一个很可能在现实中
出现的经济灾难会是什么样子的。
So we sent Ryan Duffy to see what the world's next realistic disaster might just look like.

19
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:18,602
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&} 道兰论坛  daolan.net  原创字幕 
 English subtitle comes from  daolan.net forum 

20
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:23,702
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}欢迎观看中国现实中经济增长的面目。
Welcome to the face of China's realistic boom.

21
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:29,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}欢迎来到天东城，位于上海南部，中国最大的仿巴黎社区。
Welcome to TianDuCheng, China's biggest Paris playground just south of Shanghai.

22
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:38,402
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这个仿巴黎社区有些能勾起人来看看的欲望，有几分人性的味道。
Paris is a little bit of to be desired, a little bit of several human meanings.  

23
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:41,402
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}什么使得这个单纯的仿造巴黎社区变得有趣？
What makes this copycat Paris intersting?

24
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,902
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}它只是个单纯的仿造巴黎的社区吗？
Is it just the copycat Paris?

25
00:01:44,168 --> 00:01:47,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}它是一个完全荒置的纯仿造巴黎的社区。
It is a completely abandoned copycat Paris.

26
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:51,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}用来做婚礼照相，猎奇之类的事情。
used for little more than wedding photos and curiosity seeking.

27
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:58,702
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}你怎么会选择在这拍结婚照的？
How did you choose to marry here?

28
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:09,602
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这不是实际中的商业，现实里还没有一个商业。
It's not actually that business, not a business actually real.

29
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}哦，看看这些乱七八糟的玩意。
Oh... look at this realistic fuck.

30
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:29,702
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}在这个地点建造自由的埃菲尔铁塔，这个是一个好主意
So, this site, build this free impressive Gustave Eiffel Tower which is the fine idea and then

31
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:33,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}之后就开发了这一片目所能及的所有的土地，
developed all of this part of as far as the eye can see 

32
00:02:33,768 --> 00:02:38,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这个主意一直很好，直到大家集体决定: 我不想住这。
which also a fine idea until everyone decide collectively: we don't want to live there.

33
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:42,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}房地产已经成为中国经济的主要增涨因素。
Real estate has been a major growth factor for the Chinese economy.

34
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:47,002
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}近些年大约占总 GDP 的 30%。
Accounting for about 30% of the country soaring GDP in recent years.

35
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:50,702
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}但许多这类建设已经处于投机过热了。
But a lot of this construction has been wildly speculated.

36
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:53,802
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}中国政府是会把这些工程算作经济增涨，
Sure, the Chinese government may count these projects as growth, 

37
00:02:54,068 --> 00:03:00,302
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}但问题是，中国只根据房屋建设来计算 GDP，
并非根据房屋销售情况。
but the problem is that China calculates GDP due property construction, not property sales.

38
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:04,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}人们讨论房地产市场对于中国 GDP 的影响，
People talked about the property market's effect to China's GDP.  

39
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:09,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}诚然，近十年来，中国是出口型经济。
It's true that 10 years ago, China export led economy.

40
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:14,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}但现在，房地产已经成为中国 GDP 中最重要的影响因子。
but now these property has been the single most important factors to this.

41
00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:19,702
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}房地产市场已经在很大程度上嵌入到中国整体的经济发展中。
the property market is very much embedded in the whole part of China's economy growth.

42
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:22,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}所有这些投机已经导致了一个过分饱和的市场。
All this speculation has led to a glutton market, 

43
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}但在中国，投机商们把太多的关注点都放在了房地产上。
they're simply weight too much real estate in China.

44
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:33,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这就导致了很多问题，类似这个已经建成5年的投资了
数十亿美元的仿造巴黎社区，社区房屋的入住率只有 2%。
and it's leading the problem like this five year old billiion dollar fake Paris with occupancy rate only 2%,

45
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:35,002
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}而且这些问题还在不断加剧。
and the problems only are getting worse.

46
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:40,802
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}简单的供求理论已经被 "先盖，后卖" 所取代。
The simple supply and demand theory has been replaced by "build now, sell later" economics.

47
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:48,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这导致有超过 6400万空置的房屋，全中国至少有 
11 个大规模的空置鬼城。
That's led to over 64 million empty homes and at least 11 massive empty ghost towns across the country.

48
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:52,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}象内蒙古的康巴什新区，
Places like Kangbashi District in China's Inner Mongolia, 

49
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:58,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}康巴什新区于 2004年开工建造，花费高达 50亿美元，
Kangbashi was built in 2004, with cost as many as high 5 billion dollars,

50
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:00,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}现在完全停工了。
and it's a complete bust.

51
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:05,702
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}设计目标是容纳一百万人，却只有 3万人入住。
Designed to hold 1 million people, it has a population only 30,000.

52
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:15,302
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}巴特尔是一位退休的城市工人，也是新区中基本
不需要的出租车司机之一。
Meet Bater, a retired city co-worker and one of the only cab-drivers in a town that bearly needs any cab at all.

53
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:19,802
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这些都是新建的楼房，是吧？
So, these are all really new buildings, right?

54
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:37,802
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}会如何处理所有这些盖了一半的高楼？
What's going to happen to all these half-built high-rises?

55
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:45,802
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这些都是工程只进行了一半的高楼，现在完全荒置了。
There are buildings that are mid-construction, that are now just completely abandoned 

56
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:48,902
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}in addition to    and also completely abandoned.

57
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:56,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}康巴什新区是一个令人震惊的选址。
Kangbashi is a stunning site.

58
00:04:56,768 --> 00:05:01,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}一栋接着一栋，大规模的高楼，有些完工了，
多数却都没有完工。
block after block, massive high-rise buildings, some finished, most unfinished, 

59
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:07,902
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这块土地用来拍摄大浩劫后的科幻电影会是一个完美的选址。
and none of more than 2 or 3 tenets, a perfect location for a post-apocalypse design fiction film.

60
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:11,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}但显然不适合用来建造一个城市。
but apparently, a really bad location for a city.

61
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:15,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}当在这座新城走动时，感觉这里过于现实了，
So it was too realistic when you walk around the city, 

62
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:18,802
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}在外围郊区能看到这类没有完工的开发。
and there just endless developments where you see this on the outside.

63
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:23,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}都是宏伟的设计、各类方案，楼很漂亮，我喜欢住在那。
just grand designs, schemes, it's beautiful, I'd love to live here.

64
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:27,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}但是要把头缩回到这些脚手架后面。
but then you just pull your head right behind this scaffold thing.

65
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:30,702
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这种现实和当初计划的情况相距甚远。
and it's so far from what they have planned.

66
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:38,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们采访一位当地的调查记者，看看在现代中国，
这类大规模的空置新区是如何在现实中成为可能的。
We talk to a local investigate reporter about how realistic this massive is even possible in modern China.

67
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:33,802
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这是小的样本房间，现在就调查一下。
this small sample size, research it right now. 

68
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:42,402
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}好的，继续往前，看看那间房，没有人住。
ok, go ahead, call that one, no one lives in.

69
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:47,402
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们已经下了四层楼了，还没见到住户。
so we've come down 4 floors, and so far, no resident.

70
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:51,002
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}多数的房门都还用板围着呢。
most of the doors are still boarded up.

71
00:06:52,268 --> 00:07:00,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}想再近距离，看看猜猜，一个超自然的泡温泉的房间？
Oh, you got wanna so close, watch and guess, supernatural spa room? 

72
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:05,902
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}很可能是个放棺材的房间？
could be as fuck a coffin room?

73
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:09,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这是你们猜的，你们去钉钉子吧。
and that was your guess, you nail with. 

74
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:20,802
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们在这巨大的楼房中游荡却没被处罚，周围也有很多建筑。
We walk around this place with impunity in this gigantic building and a bunch of neighbourhood ones.

75
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:23,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}一个人也没有！这里绝对是没有人！
There's no one, absolutely no one here.

76
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:28,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们想知道，人到底是怎么卖这个公寓，怎么卖这类地方。
We want to know how the hell someone sells the apartment, sell the place like this.

77
00:07:28,768 --> 00:07:32,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们拜访一位当地的房地产中介来得到解答。
So we met up a local real estate broker to get the pitch.

78
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:43,802
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}非常好，透光好，要在曼哈顿有这么一栋公寓，你就发了。
Very nice, bright, this apartmennt in Manhattan, you 

79
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:04,902
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}看那边，至少有两家、四家居民，是吧？
Look there at least two, four residents over there, right?

80
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:12,402
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}建造这个地方有过担忧吗？
Was there ever any concern that this place being built

81
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:16,302
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}你看看周围，没人能确定这个地方是用来出售的。
that no one, you look around, not really sure this place is pending out.

82
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:19,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们是否应该重新思考这件事呢？
Should we maybe rethink this thing?

83
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:42,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们知道，这些满满的建筑会带来严重的后果。
We knew that there has to be serious consequences to all of these filled construction.

84
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:45,802
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们与 Jame Chanos 坐下来谈谈，他是杰出的现金基金经理。
So we sat down with Jame Chanos, a prominent cash fund manager, 

85
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:50,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}谈谈这些鬼城的当前和潜在的恶劣后果。
to talk about the current and potential fallout for these ghost cities.

86
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:54,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们观察中国大约有3年半了。
We began looking at China about 3.5 years ago.

87
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:58,602
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们当时试图分析理解，在几代人里最大的经济衰退潮中，
and we were trying to figure out how was that the global commodity's market were doing so well 

88
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:02,402
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}全球商品市场是如何运行的如此好的。
in the teeth of the biggest recession in generations.

89
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:07,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}当开始工作时，我们意识到，就幅度和占地面积而言，
就这个世界上最大的建筑场地而言，
and its when we did our work we realize we are looking for something was pretty much unprecedented 

90
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:13,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们正在观察的是一种在很大程度上前所未有的现象。
in terms of the scope and size of basically the world's largest construction site.

91
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:20,702
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}在 2009年年底，中国的建筑已经有 56亿平方米的地产，
At the end of 09, China had 5.6 billion square metres of property in the construction,

92
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:26,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}相当于中国的每个男人、女人、小孩都能有一个 5步长，
5步宽的房间。
that equaled to 5 feet x  5 feet office cubic for every man and women and children in China.

93
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:32,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}地方政府的基本思路就是，抢占土地，将土地周围的房屋全都拆迁，
Basically, local governments for very very little compensation are seizing the land,

94
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:37,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}然后开发盖高楼，只给当地居民非常非常少的补偿款。
bulldozing the homes around that land, and then developing high-rises.

95
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:39,402
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这就是财富的一种转移，
That's just simply a transfer of wealth,

96
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:44,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}被转移财富的数目估计多大 5万亿美元。
and the number is estimated to be as much as 5 trillion dollars US.

97
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:49,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}在康巴什新区，只要我们同意隐藏他们的身份，
找到想倾诉他们拆迁安置经历的人并不难。
In Kangbashi, it wasn't hard to find people willing to tell their own stories of displacement

98
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:52,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}as long as we agree to keep their identities hidden.

99
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:56,702
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}即使已经没有什么可以失去的东西，
他们仍旧生活在惧怕当地政府的氛围中。
Even with nothing left to lose, they were still living in fear of the local government.

100
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:34,202
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}但这不是全部，不仅底层的农民失去了他们的土地，
But it didn't stop there, not only with lower class farmers essentially keep off their land,

101
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}连中国的中产阶层也亏损了。
but China's middle class has lost out as well.

102
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:40,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}对这处房地产的投资，得到回报的希望越来越渺茫。
Investing in this real estate with increasingly bleak prospects of return.

103
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:28,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}房地产投资过热，因为在美国房地产泡沫的最高峰时，
建设投入占总 GDP 的 16%，占 1/6。
It turned to overstate because at the peak of our bubble, construction got to about 16% of GDP, for 1/6.

104
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:33,302
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}而中国近 3年的房地产，一直占 GDP 的一半，是美国的 3倍。
It's been running 50% in China now for 3 years, 3 times of our level.

105
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:39,002
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}我们的经济交易被认为是支撑国家经济的底线，
而不是一个公司的底线，
Any entity that relies on a series of one of our transactions on economic 

106
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:46,802
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}任何单位实体如果依赖于我们这一系列交易的某一项，
都将陷入大麻烦。
known as to bolster the country's bottom line, not a company's bottom line, is headed for big trouble.

107
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:50,402
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}更糟的是，中国仍在建设大规模的工程，
Making matters worse, China is still building mass projects 

108
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}这些工程最终会变成康巴什新区一样的鬼城。
that are destined to become ghost towns just like Kangbashi.

109
00:11:53,868 --> 00:11:59,402
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}事实上，在天津，一个仿造的曼哈顿金融区现在正在施工中。
In fact, a replica of Manhattan financial district, Tianjin, is under construction right now.

110
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:04,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}看起来，似乎是中国要么不理解鬼城为世界经济带来的问题，
It's as if China either doesn't understand its ghost cities are problematic for the world economy,

111
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:07,002
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}要么仅仅是忽略问题。
or they're just choosing to ignore it.

112
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:21,302
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}中美经济比过去越来越融合在一体了，
China and US are more and more integrated than ever before.

113
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:27,502
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}因此，如果中国经济跌倒崩溃，这对美国商业来讲也是坏消息。
So if China see economies falling to crash, that's going to be bad news for American business.

114
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:31,402
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}几年前，我观察第二大经模型，试图了解其中的奥妙，
A few years ago, I call the second economic model, try to know the hell,

115
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:38,302
{\fs20\1c&HFF80FF&}结果是，我觉得我们必须得给出建议，作为国家整体，
这是一个将带来大麻烦的现象。
and it end out, I guess we'd have to advise that saying it's a big trouble thing as a nation.
