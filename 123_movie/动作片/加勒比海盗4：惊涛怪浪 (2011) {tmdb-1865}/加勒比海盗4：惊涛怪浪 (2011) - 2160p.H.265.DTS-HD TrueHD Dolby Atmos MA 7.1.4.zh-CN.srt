532
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:51,670
Our laws allow the Captain to show leniency.
我们的法纪更希望船长宽慈仁厚

533
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,437
I have given this man a chance to determine his fate,
我已经给此人机会 性命在他自己手中

534
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,240
a gift not afforded to all.

Oh, you now.

You know when I feel closest to our Maker?

When I see suffering, pain and anguish.
当我看到苦难 悲恸 绝望时

542
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,599
That's when the true design of this world is revealed.
世间的真实面目在我眼前呈现

543

当困难 悲剧降临 仁慈怜悯长存人心

544

kindness and compassion are shown to those in need.
这才是世间的真实面目

545
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,416
Perhaps you should pray for him to be unharmed, yes?
或许你该祈祷他安然无恙 是吧?

546
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,747
- Please, there's still hope...  - Again!
- 求你 还有希望...  - 再来!

547
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,060
I actually have no interest in the Fountain whatsoever,
其实我对什么不老泉 没啥兴趣

548
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,068
so, if your heart is set,

you may drop me off anywhere you like.
随你把我丢到哪儿

550
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,303
That'll be all, Quartermaster.
就这样 舵手

551
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,804
Your words surround you like fog and make you hard to see.
你的话语云山雾罩 让我看不透

552
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,783
And what of you, the mighty Blackbeard?
那你呢 只手遮天的黑胡子?

553
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,684
Beheaded they say. Still, your body swam
他们说你身首异处 你的身躯绕船游了三圈

554
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:49,292
three times around your ship, then climbed back onboard.
然后又爬上船来

555
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,020
And here you are, running scared.

556
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:56,099
- Scared.  - To the Fountain.
- 胆颤心惊  - 为了找寻不老泉

557
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:59,259
The Quartermaster sees things before they happen.
舵手能未卜先知

558
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:03,897
He has foreseen my death, and so the fates have spoken.
他预见我的死亡 命运早有定数

560
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,478
You have a ridiculously high regard for fate, mate.

561
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,240
- And you?  - Me?

562
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:15,648
I'm skeptical of predicting any future... which includes me.
我对未卜先知的事深表怀疑... 包括我的命运

563
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:21,588
It'd be foolish to battle fate, but I'd be tempted to cheat it.
反抗命运是件傻事 但我愿意尝试

564
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,593
I will reach the Fountain. You will lead me.
我会找到不老泉 在你的指引下

565
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:31,023
That knife will serve you no better than the mutiny you devised.
那把刀和你谋划的叛变一样 对你毫无益处

566
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,965
Mutiny served me well.
叛变很有效果

567
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,037
It gained me an audience with you.

To warn you.
然后奉告一声

570
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,004
Regarding your first mate,
你的大副

571
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,048
who pretends to be persons she is not.
假扮他人 弄巧成拙

572
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,675
Do tell.
接着说

00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,051
She is not your daughter.

574
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,386
You dare to speak thusly of my flesh and blood?

575
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:04,057
Sir, the woman is consummate in the art of deception.

I know. As I mostly unwittingly set her on her wicked path.

578
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,843
for her existing abundance of natural talent.
她天赋秉然 源之于我

579
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,337
Angelica. My beloved daughter,

580
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,076
the one true good thing I have done in this life,

581
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,880
and you claim to be the one who corrupted her?

582
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:28,048
Sir, what she is is pure evil.
先生 她的本源是邪恶

583
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,591
More to be feared than a wild beast.

586

No need to hurt him, Father.

He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

589
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,774
You see? Even now, she attends to your welfare,
看到没? 直到现在 她还关心你的安危

590
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:53,474
giving lie to the claims you make of her.
即使你那样百般诋毁她

591
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:05,552
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?

neither will you.

among the crew, as to our destination.

606
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,785
though few know why or dare to ask.

Be the stories true?
