00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,700

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,140
庞德・里昂200年前就死了
Ponce de León died 200 years ago.

12
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,800

13
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,210

15
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,520
涨潮就行
With the tide.

加勒比海盗4:惊涛怪浪

挪过去 海盗
Move along, pirate.

27
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,070

41
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,690

Now...

42
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,070
...堂下是何人?
...what do we have here?

43
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,530
杰克?
Jack?

44
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,160
闭嘴!
Shut up!

45
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,970
我不认识他
I don't recognize him.

46
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,300
没这必要 你说什么?
Not necessary. You were saying?

47
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,070
我不是杰克・斯派洛
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

48
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,150
我叫乔士米・吉布斯!
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

49
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,010
是这样么?
Is that so?

50
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,180
- 这里写的是杰克・斯派洛\n- 我告诉他们
- It says Jack Sparrow here.\n- I told 'em.

51
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,480
我不是杰克・斯派洛\n我倒是很乐意在法庭上指证他
I'm not Jack Sparrow, who I would\nbe happy to identify to the court

52
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,520
- 如果那对我的案子有所帮助的话\n- 这真是可悲的狡辩啊
- if it would help my case.\n- I think that would be a poor defense,

53
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,360
除非你想像只大海豹那样被击倒
unless you want to be bludgeoned again\nlike a harp seal.

54
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,660
犯人声称自己
The prisoner claims of being innocent

55
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,200
不是杰克・斯派洛\n你们的裁决如何?
to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

56
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,060
不公审? 但我们不是来这里检验证据的吗...
No trial? But aren't we here\nto examine the evidence...

57
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,730
陪审团长 你觉得他有罪吗?
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

58
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,740
有罪裁决意味着他要被绞死
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.

59
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,570
绞死他! 把他吊起来!
Hang him! String him up!

60
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,370
- 有罪?\n- 这不公平!
- Guilty?\n- That's not fair!

61
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,750
闭嘴
Shut it.

62
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,780
乔士米・吉布斯 你作为杰克・斯派洛
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime of which\nyou've been found guilty of

63
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,690
被指控的罪行是无辜的
is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.

64
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,220
我在此减免你的判刑
I hereby commute your sentence,

65
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,030
判你无期徒刑
and order that you be imprisoned\nfor the remainder

66
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,030
在牢里度过你那可悲的 垂死的 \n水深火热的余生吧
of your miserable, moribund,\nmutton-chopped life.

67
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,100
- 什么?!\n- 绞死他!
- What?!\n- Hang him!

68
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,430
- 绞死他!\n- 就这样了
- Hang him!\n- There.

69
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,940
- 胡扯!\n- 吊死他! 吊得高高的!
- Balderdash!\n- String him up! Hang him high!

70
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,240
之后会安排押送这名犯人
Means shall be arranged\nto transport this prisoner

71
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,410
去伦敦塔
to the Tower of London.

72
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,230
非常感谢
Thanks very much.

73
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,790
谢谢
Ta.

74
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,230
快 滚上去
Come on. Get up there.

75
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,370
上去!
Get up!

76
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,710
该死的\n现在我们都奔监狱去了
Hell's teeth.\nNow we're both headed for prison.

77
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,520
别担心\n我买通了马夫
Not to worry.\nI've paid off the driver.

78
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,060
十分钟后 我们就到伦敦城外\n马已经在等我们了
Ten minutes, we'll be outside\nLondon Town, horses waiting.

79
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,720
今晚 我们就能到海岸
Tonight, we make the coast.

80
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,190
然后就只剩找艘船了
Then it's just a matter\nof finding a ship.

81
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,130
- 全在计划之中 对么?\n- 完全正确
- All part of the plan, yes?\n- Exactly.

82
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,200
我今早才到达伦敦城的
I arrived in London Town\njust this morning

83
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,500
为解救那个乔士米・吉布斯\n和绞架有约的人
to rescue one Joshamee Gibbs\nfrom one appointment with the gallows.

84
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,440
看见你现在还活着
Seeing as how you're still alive,

85
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,300
我得说至今为止一切都很顺利
I'd say it's all been\nvery successful thus far.

86
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,170
你怎么了 吉布斯?
What happened to you, Gibbs?

87
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,870
我以为你任职他处或是转行了呢
I thought you were employed elsewhere\nor otherwise engaged.

88
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,510
是啊 但我总是像贼一样\n偷听有关黑珍珠号的消息
Aye. But I always listened like a thief\nfor news of the Black Pearl.

89
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,120
没人知道她要驶向何方
Nobody's seen where\nshe might next make port.

90
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,310
然后 我听到谣传:
Then, I hear a rumor:

91
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,950
杰克・斯派洛在伦敦招募新人员上船
Jack Sparrow's in London\nwith a ship and looking for a crew.

92
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,820
- 我没有啊\n- 但我听说的是这样
- Am not.\n- But that's what I heard.

93
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,190
事实上 你今晚就要在
Fact is, you're signing up men tonight.

94
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,860
叫"船长的女儿"的酒吧签人
Pub called The Captain's Daughter.

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,230
- 我没有!\n- 嗯 我觉得这事有点怪
- Am not!\n- Well, I thought it a bit odd,

96
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,100
但然后 你从来都不按常理出牌
but then, you've never been\nthe most predictable of sorts.

97
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,240
告诉我
Tell me something.

98
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,900
是不是有人在借我的名字\n在外面玷污我的名声?
There is another Jack Sparrow out there\nsullying my good name?

99
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,210
- 骗子\n- 没错
- An impostor.\n- Indeed.

100
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,110
但是...是一个有船的骗子
But... an impostor with a ship.

101
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,810
需要人手
And in need of a crew.

102
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,980
此乃天助我也 我也如此
Which, as fate would have it, so am I.

103
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,580
你怎么样 杰克?
What about you, Jack?

104
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,590
上次我听说\n你固执的要找到不老泉
Last I heard, you were hell-bent\nto find the Fountain of Youth.

105
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,250
运气如何?
Any luck?

106
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,270
遇到了状况\n我们不得不...
Circumstances arose\nand forced a compelling insight

107
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,410
先英勇救人
regarding discretion and valor.

108
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,670
- 那就是说你放弃了\n- 我没有
- Meaning, you gave up.\n- I did not.

109
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,610
我只是和以往一样一心不二\n极其确定
I am just as bent as ever.\nHellishly so.

110
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,580
我会尝到那些水的\n吉布斯船长 记着我的话
I shall taste those waters,\nMaster Gibbs. Mark my words.

111
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,380
挺近啊
Short trip.

112
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,360
都在计划之中 对么?
All part of the plan, yes?

113
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,560
不对
No.

114
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,050
你就是杰克・斯派洛?
You are Jack Sparrow?

115
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,790
还应该有个"船长"
There should be a "Captain"\nin there somewhere.

116
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,460
我听说过你
I've heard of you.

117
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,660
你也知道我是谁
And you know who I am.

118
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,260
看起来面熟\n我以前勒索过你么?
Face is familiar.\nHave I threatened you before?

119
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,170
在你面前的是乔治・奥古斯特斯\n布朗斯维克-鲁纳伯格的公爵
You are in the presence of George\nAugustus, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg,

120
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,180
和神圣的罗马帝国财务大臣和选帝侯
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector\nof the Holy Roman Empire,

121
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,710

King of Great Britain and Ireland,\nand of you.

122
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,550
- 没印象\n- 我得知
- Doesn't ring a bell.\n- I am informed

123
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,150
你来伦敦为你的船招募人手
you have come to London\nto procure a crew for your ship.

124
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,430
恶毒的谣言 不是真的
Vicious rumor. Not true.

125
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,690
那刚才你说你是杰克・斯派洛就是骗我咯
Then you lied to me when you\ntold me you were Jack Sparrow.

126
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,060
我是杰克・斯派洛\n但我不是来这儿找人手的
I am Jack Sparrow,\nbut I'm not here to procure a crew.

127
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,630
那是... 别的人
That is... someone else.

128
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,330
别的叫杰克・斯派洛的人
Someone else named Jack Sparrow.

129
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,240
你们带错人了 害我白跑一趟了
You've brought me the wrong wastrel.

130
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,680
找到那个真的 把这个冒牌货干掉
Find the proper one\nand dispose of this impostor.

131
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,870
不 等等 等等 等等 别急
No, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute.

132
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,420
我是独一无二的杰克・斯派洛
I'm Jack Sparrow, the one and only.

133
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,250

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,890
- 不老泉...\n- 什么?

137
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,590

我们知道你手上拿着地图

没收地图 然后绞了他!
So confiscate the map,\nand to the gallows with him!

141
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,070
你有地图么?

142
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,450
- 没\n- 在哪儿?
- No.\n- Where is it?

143
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,280
真话? 我弄丢了

144
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,410
- 事实上 就在最近\n- 我有一份报告

西班牙人找到了不老泉
The Spanish have located\nthe Fountain of Youth.

146
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,430
我不会让那悲哀的西班牙君主
I will not have some\nmelancholy Spanish monarch,

147
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,160
一个天主教徒 得到永生的!
a Catholic, gain eternal life!

148
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,710
你确实知道去不老泉的路?

我当然知道\n看看我

150
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,980
你能带领一支探险队么
You could guide an expedition.

151
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,640
只要你允许 陛下
With your permission, your heinie,

152
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,190
你会给我补给 船...

153
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,450
...还有船员?

154
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,120
还有一位船长
And a captain.

155
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,970
下午好 陛下
Afternoon, sire.

156
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,350
容我大胆问一句\n为什么这人没有被链子锁起来?
If I may be so bold,\nwhy is that man not in chains?

157
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,420
他必须被马上锁起来
He must be manacled at once.

158
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,150
在我宫殿的中心? 他没啥威胁的
At the center of my palace? Hardly.

159
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,450
海克特

160
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,080
很高兴看到一个海盗弃暗投明
How nice to see a fellow pirate\nmake good of himself.

161
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,360
海盗? 不对 是私掠船
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

162
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,100
执行的是受吾王批准和保护的任务
On a sanctioned mission under the\nauthority and protection of the Crown.

163
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,700
可能吧 但首先
As may be, but first,

164
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,040
我那亲爱的珍珠号怎么样了?
what has become of my beloved Pearl?

165
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,310
我丢了珍珠号和我的腿
I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg.

166
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,710
- 珍珠号丢了?\n- 是
- Lost the Pearl?\n- Aye.

I defended her mightily enough,\nbut she be sunk nonetheless.

168
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,880
如果那艘船就这么沉了\n你也应该和她一起沉了
If that ship be sunk properly,\nyou should be sunk with it.

169
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:01,330
巴博萨船长 我们每耽误一秒\n西班牙人就甩开我们多一些
Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry,\nthe Spanish outdistance us.

170
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,900

I have every confidence\nyou will prevail and be rewarded

171
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,370
你渴望已久的高位

172
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,280
- 能为您服务就够了 陛下\n- 而你 先生 堕落了
- To serve doth suffice, sire.\n- You, sir, have stooped.

173
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,750
杰克 你的时间不多了
Jack, our sands be all but run.

174
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,220
何不加入赢者的队列呢?
Where's the harm\nin joining the winning side?

175
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,150
你也能和王公贵族接触

176
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,690
我都明白
I understand everything.

177
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,390
除了那假发
Except that wig.

178
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,860
他要逃了!\n拦住他!
He's getting away!\nStop him!

179
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,600
- 射他的头!\n- 不! 拦住那海盗!

射他的头!
Head him off!

00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,520
让开路!
Out of the way!

191
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,550
拦住那个海盗!
Stop that pirate!

192
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,250
把路让开!
Move out of the way!

198
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,420
肮脏的海盗
Filthy pirate.

199
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,670

我听说你正在招人

我知道你要去哪儿\n不老泉

你去过?

205
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,190
你看这张脸像是去过不老泉的么?

206
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,830

- Depends on the light.\n- Son, the Fountain.

207
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,800
需要有指定的物品\n才能完成凡俗的仪式

208
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,570

出海之前要找到所有的细节
Find out every detail\nbefore you set sail.

213
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,720
哦 出海 我也想

214
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,090
但那样 我可得要条船

那边那些伙计 他们有船

217

最后一件事 小杰
And one last thing, Jackie.

220
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,910
泉会考验你\n记住我的话

221
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,380

223
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,310
{\fnarial black\fs14\4a&H64&\fscx90\fscy110}There is nothing can console me

224

是啊 那是

227
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,570
杰克・斯派洛要准备远行

你知道我是谁么 哥们?

232
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,590
嘿 伙计们!

233
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,320
这儿有个小子忘记自己的名字了!
There's a bloke here what's\nforgotten his own name!

234
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,360
小伙子们 我和斯派洛一起出航
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.

235
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,290
谁要给水手买杯酒?
Who'll buy a sailor a drink?

236
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,920
谁是下一个?

237
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,440

是啊 做四个吧

别再做那个动作了
Stop doing that.

241
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,120
只有一个活着的人知道那招
Only one person alive knows that move.

242
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,990
早就想做这个了

243
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,730
你好啊 安洁莉卡

你好 杰克 大开眼界了没
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?

245
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,340
我想我差点有一次或者两次\n可以杀了你
I think I almost killed you\nonce or twice there.

246
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,540
我真感动 这是最真诚的恭维了
I'm touched at this most\nsincerest form of flattery.

247
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,220
但为什么?
But why?

248
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,020
你是唯一我能冒充的海盗
You were the only pirate\nI thought I would pass for.

249
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,890
这可不是恭维
That is not a compliment.

250
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,990
别担心 杰克\n我很早前就原谅你了
Don't worry, Jack.\nI forgave you a long time ago.

251
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:37,300
- 为什么? 离开你么?\n- 记清楚是我离开你的
- For what? For leaving you?\n- Recall that I left you.

252
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,340
一个绅士会允许小姐活在她杜撰的世界
A gentleman allows a lady\nto maintain her fictions.

253
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,000
你看 斯派洛 只要我的水手们拿到钱
Look, Sparrow. As long as\nmy sailors get their money,

254
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,170
他们会愿意忍受任何的怪癖
they're willing to put up with\nany number of peculiarities.

255
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,010
有一件事我不永远会忍受
There is one peculiarity\nwith which I will not put up with.

256
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,710
要冒充我 就要冒充成船长
I will be impersonated as "Captain."\nNothing less.

257
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,880
呃 那样的话 你需要艘船
Well, for that, you need a ship,

258
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,520
恰好呢 我有一艘
and as it turns out, I have one.

259
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,400
我是需要船
I could use a ship.

260
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,260
我听说你去过不老泉
I hear tell you've been to the Fountain.

261
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,560
最近有好多的道听途说啊
There be a lot of hear-telling\ngoing on these days.

262
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,230
- 不老泉\n- 最亲爱的安洁莉卡 不用怕
- The Fountain of Youth.\n- Dearest Angelica, fret not.

263
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,140
你还有几年不错的光阴呢
You still have a few usable years left.

264
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,610
总是那么会说话
Always so charming.

265
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,870
你没回答我
You didn't answer me.

266
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,580
好 且不管那泉\n浪费时间 真的...
Aye. Regarding the Fountain.\nWaste of time, really...

267
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,350
夫人 我发现一个不像海员的人\n在到处打探消息
Milady, I see unseamanlike fellows\nof an officious-looking nature.

268
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,150
无耻的海盗!\n找到他们! 
Wretched pirates!\nFind 'em! Maggots!

269
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,520
你的朋友?
Friends of yours?

270
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,290
我可能是无心的\n得罪了国王或是别的谁
I may have unintentionally\nslighted some king or other.

271
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,230
开门!
Open it!

272
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,030
- 是啊 你一点都没变\n- 是说我要改变吗?
- Yeah, you haven't changed.\n- Implying the need?

273
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,540
是
Yes.

274
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,370
开门 以陛下的名义
Open this door,\nin the name of His Majesty.

275
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,870
你背叛了的\n你勾引我还利用了我
You betrayed me.\nYou seduced me and you used me.

276
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,740
我当初对男人的花招都知之甚少
I was innocent of the ways of men.

277
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,180
你对付我这情场老手 也花招也不少
You demonstrated a lot of technique\nfor someone I supposedly corrupted.

278
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,080
快逃啊 这里 快 夫人!
Imminent danger. Here, now, milady!

279
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,850
打开!
Open it!

280
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,550
我都准备好我的誓言了 可你...
I was ready to take my vows. And you...

281
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,320
你跑去西班牙修院做什么?
What were you doing in\na Spanish convent, anyway?

282
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,220
我搞错了 以为是妓院
Mistook it for a brothel.\nHonest mistake.

283
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,790
- 他在那儿!\n- 就在上面!
- There he is!\n- Over there!

284
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,150
我们现在不占优势
We are at a disadvantage.

285
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,690
说你自己吧\n被你冒充的人可不觉得
Speak for yourself.\nUnlike some who pretend to be,

286
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,620
但事实上 你连蜡烛都拿不稳
but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,

287
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,230
我才是杰克・斯派洛船长
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.

288
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,990
你怎么能说我利用你?
How can you say I used you?

289
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,330
你自己心里清楚
You know exactly how.

290
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,600
我知道 但你怎么能那么说?
I know, but how can you say it?

291
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,740
- 怎么样\n- 什么怎么样
- So, what is it?\n- What is what?

292
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,410
不老泉啊
About the Fountain.

293
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,050
你知道多少
What do you know?

294
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,620
你不会恰好拿着
You don't happen to be in possession

295
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,990
两只庞德・里昂的银圣杯吧?
of two silver chalices,
circa Ponce de Len?

296
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,560
- 没有\n- 哈 我就知道
- No.\n- Thought not.

297
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,330
- 怎么了?\n- 我听到一些故事
- Why?\n- I hear stories.

298
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,300
谣言
Rumors.

299
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,570
你当然知道有仪式
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.

300
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,630
嗯 我知道
Yes, I am.

301
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,710
是什么?\n需要带什么去呢?
What is it?\nWhat is required?

302
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,310
一条美人鱼 杰克
A mermaid, Jack.

303
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,690
这绝对是个错误
There's been a mistake.

304
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,360
是无期徒刑 不是死刑 我不能死!
It's a life sentence, not death. Life!

305
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,100
- 巴博萨\n- 谢谢 绅士们
- Barbossa.\n- Thank you, gentlemen.

306
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,230
我相信你会打套索吧
I trust you can tie a noose.

307
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,780
那挺难的
That's a hard thing,

308
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,910
逼人给圈自己的上吊绳
forcing a man to twist\nhis own hanging rope.

309
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,580
自己种下的恶果得自己尝
You must lie in your bed\nthe way you made it.

310
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,790
你是怎么了?
What's happened to you?

311
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,360
- 杰克・斯派洛在哪儿?\n- 他逃了
- Where be Jack Sparrow?\n- He escaped.

312
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,930
我时间表很紧 吉布斯
I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs.

313
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,430
皇家探宝舰队天一亮就要起航了
The HMS Providence\nsets sail at first light.

314
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,730
如果你不想看它出发\n就吊死在这儿
If you do not care to watch it\nhanging here dead,

315
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,890
搞得满嘴的苍蝇...
with a mouth full of flies...

316
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,160
否则...现在就交代
...speak now.

317
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,400
带我跟你走吧\n任何地方...
Take me with you.\nAny point of the compass...

318
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,380
带你去哪儿 吉布斯\n不老泉? 嗯?
Take you where, Gibbs?\nThe Fountain? Aye?

319
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,510
那是杰克打算去的地方?
Is that where Jack be headed?

320
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,710
你有什么能告诉我的 吉布斯?
Have you anything\nyou can offer me, Gibbs?

321
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,380
随便什么啊
Anything at all?

322
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,650
我明着跟你说吧\n你别想看见黎明了
Upon me naked word,\nyou'll not see the dawn.

323
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,430
交过来
Hand it over.

324
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,470
- 你这蠢人\n- 我有足够的时间
- You fool!\n- I had just enough time

325
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,100
来学习这些阴间的圆圈
to study those infernal circles.

326
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,880
每条路线 每个目的地\n都存在...这里
Every route, every destination.\nAll safe... in here.

327
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,410
欢迎回归皇家海军\n吉布斯先生
Welcome back to His Majesty's navy,\nMaster Gibbs.

328
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
准备起航 水手
Show a leg, sailor!

329
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,870
遵命 先生
Aye, sir.

330
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,710
什么?
What?

331
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,040
- 这误会大了\n- 继续走
- There's been a horrible mistake.\n- Keep moving.

332
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,520
- 我不该在这里\n- 很多人在海里醒来
- I'm not supposed to be here.\n- Many a man's woken up at sea,

333
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,590
茫茫然不知是怎么回事
no idea what, when, wherefore or why.

334
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,980
完全忘记前晚签下合同
No memory of the night afore,\nwhence he signed up

335
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,650
然后把所有的意外之财全部拿去买醉
and drank away all his bonus money.

336
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,780
不 不 不 你不明白 伙计
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate.

337
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,330
我是杰克・斯派洛船长\n独一无二的
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.\nThe original. The only.

338
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,020
我是斯克罗姆 幸会 现在继续走
Scrum, and the pleasure's all mine.\nNow, keep moving.

339
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,010
斯克罗姆
Scrum.

340
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,370
把你的胳膊肘收回去
Get your elbows in!

341
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,750
为什么有一具玻璃棺材
Why is there a glass coffin?

342
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,350
我看起来像管事的吗
Do I look like a man in charge?

343
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,420
- 我在哪里\n- 抱歉 斯派洛船长先生
- Where am I?\n- 'Scuse me, Captain Sparrow, sir.

344
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,220
十分荣幸地欢迎您
I be right honored\nto welcome you aboard

345
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,620
登上臭名昭著的安妮女王复仇号
our world-renowned vessel of infamy,\nQueen Anne's Revenge.

346
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,690
黑胡子的船
Blackbeard.

347
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,910
干活
Work!

348
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,450
- 他长得很奇怪\n- 他是僵尸人
- He's a curious one.\n- He's been zombiefied.

349
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,250
僵尸人
Zombiefied.

350
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,890
黑胡子船长干的\n所有带头的都是
Blackbeard's doing.\nAll the officers are the same.

351
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,760
这样他们才更顺从
Makes 'em more compliant.

352
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,000
脾气暴躁嘛
And perpetually ill-tempered.

353
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,300
- 快点吧 用力擦\n- 嗯
- Come on. Scrub.\n- Yeah.

354
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,010
拉 拉 拉
Pull! Pull! Pull!

355
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,110
航行了五天 至少
Five days underway, at least.

356
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,090
对 你闻着海水的味就知道吗
Aye. You can tell that\nby the smell of the sea?

357
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,960
是船员的臭味
Smell of the crew.

358
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,630
喂 那个倒霉蛋做了什么
Oi. What did that poor sod do?

359
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,800
我最好不要重蹈覆辙
And how can I make sure to not?

360
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,270
他吗? 他是个基督徒
Him? Churchly fellow.

361
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,430
总是念叨着万能的主啊
Always going on about the Lord Almighty.

362
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,310
是船上的狂热教徒?
Bible-thumper on this ship?

363
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,350
他以前是传教士
A missionary is his story.

364
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,240
我听说他在一次掠夺中被俘
What I heard was\nhe got captured in a raid.

365
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,250
船上其余人都被杀了\n不过他没有
Rest of the ship got killed,\nbut not 'im.

366
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,680
大副不让杀他
First mate wouldn't let it happen

367
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,520
因为他之前是信主的
on account of his premier standing\nwith the Lord.

368
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,060
大副拼上她的性命帮一个囚犯
A first mate sticking her neck out\nfor some prisoner.

369
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,820
实在是太少见了
That you don't see.

370
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,660
"她" 大副是个女的?
"Her"? First mate is a "her"?

371
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,030
回去工作
Back to work!

372
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,610
平稳向前
Steady as she goes.

373
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,200
你是个冷酷 没有感情 难缠的坏女人
You are a ruthless,\nsoulless, cross-grained cur.

374
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,820
- 我告诉过你我有船\n- 不 是黑胡子有船
- I told you I had a ship.\n- No, Blackbeard has a ship,

375
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,770
现在我成了上面的囚犯
upon which I am now imprisoned.

376
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,910
我们做得到的 杰克
We can do this, Jack.

377
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,640
不老泉 你一直想找到的
The Fountain of Youth,\nlike you always wanted.

378
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,880
黑胡子 爱德华・汀奇\n让所有海盗闻风丧胆的海盗
Blackbeard. Edward Teach.\nThe pirate all pirates fear.

379
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,180
闲着没事时让死人复活
Resurrector of the dead\nin his spare time.

380
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,190
- 他会听我的\n- 他谁的都不听
- He will listen to me.\n- He listens to no one.

381
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,220
或许他听自己亲生女儿的呢?
Maybe to his own daughter?

382
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,700
女儿...他亲生女儿
Daughter as in... beget by?

383
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,400
失散了很久 最近才相认
Long-lost. Recently found.

384
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,370
她全身心爱着她亲爱的爸爸
Who loves her dear papa\nwith all her soul.

385
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,570
- 他相信?\n- 我说服了他
- He bought that?\n- I sold that.

386
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,810
然后他是为他自己找不老泉
Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him,

387
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,820
或者是为他和你 不是为你和我吧
or him and you, not you and me.

388
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,050
没错 杰克 最精彩的是
No, Jack, that's the best part.

389
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,250
他即将死去
He will be dead.

390
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,960
你要亲手杀了他?
You'll be handling\nthat part yourself, then?

391
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,360
有一个预言
There is a prophecy.

392
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,690
也许你不相信超自然现象
Maybe you don't believe\nin the supernatural.

393
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,290
哦 不 我见过一两次这样的事
Oh, no, no.\nI've seen a thing or two.

394
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,830
预言是这么说的
The prophecy is this:

395
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,810
黑胡子在两周内就会死
Blackbeard will meet his death\nwithin a fortnight

396
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,400
死在一个独脚人的手上
at the hands of a one-legged man.

397
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,750
所以他才不是想要不老泉 杰克
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.

398
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,830
吉布斯先生 我们没有地图
Master Gibbs, short we are a map.

399
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,070
也许你能好心给我们指个方向
Perhaps you'd be so kind\nas to provide us an heading.

400
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,940
做点好事 给我倒杯酒
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.

401
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,520
我们是私掠船 不是海盗 吉布斯先生
Nay. We be privateers,\nnot pirates, Master Gibbs.

402
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,780
我们以国王的名义做事
And in the king's name,\nwe behave as such.

403
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,750
遵命 船长
Aye, Captain.

404
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,960
我们在正确的航线上吗 吉布斯?
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?

405
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,690
是的 航线正确 这就是证据
Aye, it be proper. There's your proof.

406
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,500
西班牙人
The Spaniard.

407
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,810
全体船员 进入备战状态\n驶向迎风面
All hands! Battle stations!\nGet to windward!

408
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,010
- 全体船员 迎风\n- 准备开炮
- All hands, windward!\n- Harden up two points!

409
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,590
- 准备开炮\n- 大炮就位
- Two points!\n- Cast loose the cannons!

410
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,320
- 炮手各就各位\n- 就位 炮手准备就绪 先生
- Gunners, take posts!\n- Take position! Gunners ready, sir!

411
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,330
- 出! 推!\n- 等我命令
- Out! Thrust!\n- Await orders.

412
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,800
稳住
Steady!

413
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,730
炮弹装好 等待命令 先生
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.

414
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,070
先生 下令啊 先生!
Sir. Orders, sir?

415
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,420
他连头都不转过来
He never so much as turned his head.

416
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,420
不老泉才是目标
The Fountain is the prize.

417
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,190
甚至都不愿浪费时间来击沉我们
It appears we be not even worth\nthe time it'd take to sink us.

418
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:48,230
现在我们落后了 全体船员 升帆
And now we've fallen behind.\nAll hands, make more sail!

419
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,930
全体船员 升帆
All hands, more sail!

420
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,400
全速前进
Ride hard between wind and tide!

421
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,980
先生们 我要说的是暴动
The topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.

422
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,550
最恐怖的暴动
Mutiny most foul.

423
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,220
是的 我是要来当杰克・斯派洛的水手\n不是冒牌货
Aye. I signed up to sail\nunder Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.

424
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,620
还是个女人
And a lady, at that.

425
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,960
也没提到有可怕的僵尸人
And mention was failed to\nbe made of this uncanny crew.

426
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,460
我怕得腿都软了
Make my toes curl, they do.

427
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,660
我拿到了 全部
I got 'em. All of them.

428
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,770
- 干得好\n- 好样的
- Well done.\n- Good lad.

429
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,340
那么我说 黑胡子船长
On to it, then. Blackbeard.

430
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,940
- 他有什么习惯\n- 他几乎都待在船长室
- What are his habits?\n- Stays mostly to his cabin.

431
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,880
没错 差不多都待在船长室
That's right, mostly to his cabin.

432
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,210
- 好 不过当他出来时...\n- 他根本不出来
- Yes, but when he comes out...\n- He don't really come out.

433
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,550
他一定有出来的时候
He must come out sometime.

434
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,620
没有
Not really, no.

435
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,150
你们谁曾和他一起出过海吗
Any of you sail with him before?

436
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,760
- 不 没有\n- 我从来没有过
- No, no.\n- I've never.

437
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,920
完全没有
Definitely not.

438
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,930
- 你们有人见过他吗\n- 没有
- Any of you seen him before?\n- Not really, no.

439
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,700
只待在船长室 没人和他出过海
Stays to his cabin,\nno one sailed with him,

440
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,900
没人见过他
no one's seen him...

441
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,040
好消息 先生们 这艘不是黑胡子的船
Good news, gentlemen.\nThis is not Blackbeard's ship.

442
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,010
这不是安妮女王复仇号
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.

443
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,170
不 这绝对是安妮女王复仇号
No, this be the Queen Anne's Revenge,\nright enough.

444
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,780
你怎么知道
How do you know?

445
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,180
我看到了船的名字 在船后面
I've seen the name,\non the back of the ship.

446
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,380
先生们 大伙儿们
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

447
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,260
你们被骗了
...you have been monstrously deceived.

448
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,530
- 我们被耍了吗\n- 是的
- We are decepted, then?\n- Yes.

449
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,600
你们都不知道此行的目的
You've nay been informed\nof a destination.

450
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,870
死亡就在我们眼前
Death lies before us

451
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,840
当我们找到不老泉时
as we sail for the Fountain of Youth.

452
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,340
我们处境不妙啊 伙计们
It would be a sorry plight, mates.

453
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,610
- 死亡 确确实实?\n- 黯淡灵魂的花园
- Death, for certain.\n- The garden of darkened souls.

454
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,090
- 我们的生命将过早结束\n- 除非...
- Untimely our ends will be.\n- Unless...

455
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,750
我们夺下这艘船
...we take the ship.

456
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,620
那我们就夺下这船 就现在
We take the ship, then. Now!

457
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,360
行动吧
Go on, then.

458
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,760
- 帮我 伙伴\n- 把它给我
- Help me, shipmates!\n- Give it to 'em!

459
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,170
- 醒醒 这是我们的\n- 快
- Wake up! It's ours!\n- Come on!

460
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,970
起来 给我挪开
Get up! Off your backside!

461
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,880
- 你给我起来\n- 把武器给他们 
- Get off your fannies!\n- Take it to them, lads!

462
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,850
快帮着我 打啊
Help me! Fight!

463
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,800
杰克
Jack.

464
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,060
如果这是个梦\n你可以留着剑和靴子
If this is a dream,\nyou can keep the sword and boots on.

465
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,730
- 如果不是...\n- 这是个梦
- If it's not...\n- It's a dream.

466
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,410
不 这不是梦
No, it's not!

467
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,280
我认为我应该好心给你个警告\n我们在夺船
I thought I should give you\nfair warning, we're taking the ship.

468
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,810
不是针对你个人
Nothing personal.

469
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,790
如果你别插手
Think you might be better off\nif you just...

470
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,760
会比较好
...stay out of it.

471
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,650
碍事
Boggit.

472
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,540
混蛋
Wretch!

473
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,160
你要么加入我们 要么就是敌人
You're either with us or against us!

474
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,500
我不加入 也不是敌人
I am not with you,\nneither am I against you!

475
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,010
他这样可以?
Can he do that?

476
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,170
他是教徒 我想他必须这样
He's religious.\nI believe it's required.

477
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,820
奋战到底吧 你们这些蠢猴子
Fight to the bitter end,\nyou cack-handed deck apes!

478
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,030
抓住他 把他绑起来
Take him, men.\nTie him down tight!

479
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,510
船是我们的了
The ship is ours!

480
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,580
先生们
Gentlemen.

481
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,520
我不明白了
I be placed in a bewilderment.

482
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,290
我在里面休息
There I were, resting,

483
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:59,100
突然间 我听到甲板上的吵闹声
and upon a sudden,\nI hear an ungodly row on deck.

484
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,110
水手放下手中的活
Sailors abandon their posts

485
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,770
未经同意 擅离职守
without orders, without leave.

486
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,110
船桅前的那些人
Men before the mast,

487
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,650
就想要把船据为己有
taking the ship for themselves.

488
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,690
这算什么啊 大副
What be that, First Mate?

489
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,690
- 暴动 船长\n- 再说一次?
- Mutiny, Captain.\n- Again?

490
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,830
- 暴动\n- 听到了
- Mutiny!\n- Aye.

491
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,090
暴动
Mutiny.

492
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,040
暴动的下场是什么?
And what fate befalls mutineers?

493
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,700
大家知道答案的 是吗
Now, we know the answer to that,\ndo we not?

494
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:39,440
暴动者会被吊死
Mutineers hang!

495
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,990
船长 我想报告有人暴动
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.

496
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,090
我可以指出是哪些人干的
I can name fingers and point names.

497
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,730
不需要了 斯派洛先生
No need, Mr. Sparrow.

498
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:39,100
他们都是小绵羊\n而你 他们的主脑
They are sheep. You, their shepherd.

499
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,710
我有没有说过 先生\n您的女儿有多可爱?
Have I mentioned, sir,\nwhat a lovely daughter you have?

500
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,780
垂死前的灵魂最后的美景
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

501
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,350
别忘了 父亲 我们需要他
Remember, Father.\nWe need him.

502
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,970
如果我不时不时的杀个人
If I don't kill a man\nevery now and then,

503
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,520
- 他们就会忘了我是谁\n- 懦夫
- they forget who I am.\n- Coward!

504
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,390
他们没有忘记
They do not forget.

505
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,860
你的船员认清你是个卑鄙小人
Your crew sees you\nfor the miscreant you are.

506
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,330
懦夫 不管你杀多少人
A coward, no matter how many you slay.

507
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,870
今天第二次了啊 我又糊涂了
Twice in one day,\nI find myself in a bewilderment.

508
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,130
你不是糊涂 是害怕
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.

509
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,130
你不敢走向正义光明之路
You dare not walk the path of\nrighteousness, the way of the light.

510
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,540
不是的 先生 情况其实很简单
No, sir. The truth is\nit be much simpler than all that.

511
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,580
- 我就是个大坏蛋\n- 这也对
- I am a bad man.\n- That, too.

512
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,700
我也许也得杀你 传道士
I might have to kill you too, catechist.

513
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,440
- 不!\n- 跟她的拉丁妈妈一样强悍啊
- No!\n- All Latin blood like her mother.

514
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,680
爸爸 我求你
Father, I beg you.

515
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:31,550
我老忘了为何有个传教士在船上
There I be again,\nforgetting why the missionary is here.

516
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:36,090
我女儿想拯救我的灵魂\n或者是仅剩下的灵魂
My daughter fears for my soul,\nor what's left of it.

517
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,760
你真的想拯救我吗 孩子?
You truly wish to save me, my child?

518
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,830
每个灵魂都能被救赎
Every soul can be saved.

519
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,770
真的吗 年轻的传道士?
Be that true, young cleric?

520
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,600
是的  不过 你估计希望不大啊
Yes. Though you I see\nas a bit of a long shot.

521
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:54,570
但我仍为在这个地狱般得船上的\n每个不幸的船员祷告
Still, I pray for every unfortunate soul\non this hell-bound vessel.

522
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,780
你能用你的信仰解除我的武装
You disarm me with your faith.

523
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,620
8声钟响!
Eight bells!

524
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,750
哪一个不幸的人在守了望台的啊
Which of you unfortunate souls\nstood watch?

525
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:10,850
- 我 是我在守望\n- 炮手
- I did. I stood watch.\n- Gunner.

526
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,630
你吗?
You?

527
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,930
是
Aye.

528
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,270
是哦
Aye.

529
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,400
厨子
The cook.

530
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:27,410
很好 把长船放下去!
Perfect. Lower the longboat!

531
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,640
放他过去!
Bring her about!

532
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,220
- 你干嘛要这样?\n- 暴动的刑罚 法律解释得很清楚
- Why do you do this?\n- Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

533
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,670
船长也能依法开恩的啊
Our laws allow the Captain\nto show leniency.

534
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,430
我给过这个人机会决定命运
I have given this man\na chance to determine his fate,

535
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,240
不是每个人都有这样的机会
a gift not afforded to all.

536
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,820
该你了
Oh, you now.

537
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,710
给你个机会证明祈祷的作用
Chance to show the worth\nof your prayers.

538
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,920
祈祷他脱离...邪恶?
Pray he be delivered from... evil?

539
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,600
定下航向!
Course made!

540
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:26,600
停 给他一个机会\n给你自己...
Stop. Give that man a chance.\nGive yourself a...

541
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,930
我觉得我最接近造物主是什么时候吗?
You know when I feel closest\nto our Maker?

542
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,930
是当我看到苦难 痛苦和绝望的时候
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.

543
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,590
这时他真正的愿望才会显现
That's when the true design\nof this world is revealed.

544
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,440
在苦难和悲剧出现时 他才会显现出来 
And I see it revealed when in times\nof hardship and tragedy,

545
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,870
他才会那些需要人恩施
kindness and compassion\nare shown to those in need.

546
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,410
也许你该祈祷他不受伤害 对吗
Perhaps you should pray\nfor him to be unharmed, yes?

547
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,740
- 求求你 还有希望\n- 再一次!
- Please, there's still hope...\n- Again!

548
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,060
其实我对不老泉没有兴趣
I actually have no interest\nin the Fountain whatsoever,

549
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,060
所以 如果你心意已定
so, if your heart is set,

550
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,400
你可以随便把我放在哪里
you may drop me off\nanywhere you like.

551
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,300
可以了 舵手
That'll be all, Quartermaster.

552
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:38,800
你说的话像雾一样让我看不透
Your words surround you like fog\nand make you hard to see.

553
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,780
那你呢 万能的黑胡子?
And what of you,\nthe mighty Blackbeard?

554
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,680
他们说 即便是被砍头 你的身体
Beheaded they say.\nStill, your body swam

555
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:49,290
还是绕着船游三圈\n然后爬上甲板
three times around your ship,\nthen climbed back onboard.

556
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,020
而你现在却在害怕地逃命
And here you are, running scared.

557
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,090
- 害怕?\n- 怕去不老泉
- Scared.\n- To the Fountain.

558
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,250
舵手有预知能力
The Quartermaster\nsees things before they happen.

559
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,890
他预见我的死亡\n所以命运开口了
He has foreseen my death,\nand so the fates have spoken.

560
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,370
我的命数已定
The threads of destiny woven.

561
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,470
你对命运有点可笑的迷信啊 老兄
You have a ridiculously\nhigh regard for fate, mate.

562
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,240
- 那你呢?\n- 我?
- And you?\n- Me?

563
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,640
我对算命这一套都表示怀疑...\n包括算我自己的
I'm skeptical of predicting\nany future... which includes me.

564
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:21,580
与命运抗争比较傻\n但是我还是甘愿冒险
It'd be foolish to battle fate,\nbut I'd be tempted to cheat it.

565
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,590
我会找到不老泉 你带我去
I will reach the Fountain.\nYou will lead me.

566
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:31,020
那把刀就和你策划的暴动一样没有用
That knife will serve you no better\nthan the mutiny you devised.

567
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,960
暴动很有效
Mutiny served me well.

568
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,030
让我见到你了不是?
It gained me an audience with you.

569
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,260
是啊
Aye.

570
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,470
我警告你
To warn you.

571
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,000
你的大副
Regarding your first mate,

572
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,040
并不是她说的那个人
who pretends to be persons she is not.

573
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,670
继续说啊
Do tell.

574
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,050
她不是你女儿
She is not your daughter.

575
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,380
你胆敢这么说我的亲生骨肉?
You dare to speak\nthusly of my flesh and blood?

576
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,050
先生 那女人骗术高超
Sir, the woman is consummate\nin the art of deception.

577
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,660
我很清楚\n是我不小心让她走上这条路
I know. As I mostly unwittingly\nset her on her wicked path.

578
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,730
虽然我不能领功 说
Though I cannot claim credit

579
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,840
她天生会骗人是我的功劳
for her existing abundance\nof natural talent.

580
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,330
安洁莉卡 我钟爱的女儿
Angelica.\nMy beloved daughter,

581
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,070
我这辈子做过唯一的真正的好事
the one true good thing\nI have done in this life,

582
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,880
而你说 是你把她变成这样的?
and you claim to be the one\nwho corrupted her?

583
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,040
先生 她很邪恶的
Sir, what she is is pure evil.

584
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,590
比野兽还可怕
More to be feared than a wild beast.

585
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,560
又饿又有尖牙的野兽
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.

586
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,720
来自地狱的饥饿野兽...
Vengeful, hungry from hell beast...

587
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,020
- 父亲?\n- 甜美啊!
- Father?\n- Sweetness!

588
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,520
没有必要伤害他 爸爸
No need to hurt him, Father.

589
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:45,900
他会帮助我们 对吧 杰克
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

590
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,770
看见了吗? 即便是现在 她还是关心你的生死
You see? Even now,\nshe attends to your welfare,

591
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:53,470
尽管你一直诋毁她
giving lie to the claims\nyou make of her.

592
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:05,550
你会带我们到不老泉 对吧?
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?

593
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,050
这么说吧
Put another way.

594
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,260
要是我来不及赶到不老泉...
If I do not make it\nto the Fountain in time...

595
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,890
...你也不能
...neither will you.

596
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,170
我马上就看这些航海图 好吗?
I'll have a wee look-see at those charts\nstraight away then, shall I?

597
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,170
先生
Sir.

598
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,420
- 什么事?\n- 船长先生
- Aye?\n- Captain, sir,

599
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,950
我听到不好的谣言 先生
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

600
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,280
船员都在传 是关于我们的目的地的
among the crew,\nas to our destination.

601
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,450
闭上你的狗嘴 给我滚
Shut your trap and make way.

602
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,090
- 你想抗命吗\n- 我无意冒犯 船长...
- That's the way of it, then.\n- No disrespect, sir.

603
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,730
他们在怕什么 快说出来 讲
What do the men fear?\nSay it. Speak the words.

604
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:54,800
白帽湾
Whitecap Bay.

605
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,070
是啊 白帽湾
Aye, Whitecap Bay.

606
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:02,270
每一个没用的水手都怕这名字\n然后自以为是
And every worthless seaman\nfears the name, and rightly so,

607
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,780
虽然很少人知道为什么
though few know why or dare to ask.

608
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,540
谣言是真的吗...
Be the stories true?

609
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,520
有话直说 吉布斯
Say what robs you of\nyour staunch heart, Gibbs,

610
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,820
不然就当你自己痴人说梦
or forever leave it\nto the wider fields of fancy.

611
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,120
人鱼 船长
Mermaids, Captain.

612
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,020
是啊 人鱼
Aye. Mermaids.

613
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,330
海怪 恶鱼 特爱吃人肉
Sea ghouls, devil fish,\ndreadful in hunger for flesh of man.

614
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:26,030
我们就是要经过人鱼海域
Mermaid waters, that be our path.

615
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,760
别丢了魂呐 吉布斯
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

616
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:30,800
听说人鱼会把人吃到...
as mermaids be given\nto take the rest...

617
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,500
...只剩骨头
{\fnarial black\fs14\4a&H64&\fscx90\fscy110}...to the bone.

618
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,810
稳住 稳住 鼓起勇气
Steady! Steady, men!\nFind your courage,

619
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,850
不然就准备面对恐惧
or be ready to purpose your fear!

620
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,390
自救啊!
Save yourselves!

621
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,820
- 有人落水啦\n- 不 那是逃命的
- Man overboard!\n- Nay! A deserter.

622
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,720
- 改变航向\n- 不行
- Come about.\n- Nay!

623
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,830
先生们  我不会要求你们
Gentlemen, I shall not ask\nany more of any man than what

624
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:59,460
做办不到的事\n但是我要问你们 我们是不是皇家海军?
that man can deliver, but I do ask this:\nAre we not king's men?

625
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,040
是
Aye.

626
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,940
- 是不是执行国王的命令?\n- 是
- On the king's mission?\n- Aye.

627
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:08,340
我在经过我们的西班牙人眼中\n可没看到恐惧啊
I did not note any fear in the eyes\nof the Spanish as they passed us by.

628
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,210
- 我们难道不是皇家海军?\n- 是!
- Are we not king's men?\n- Aye!

629
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:14,280
是 准备 转向!
Aye! Hands all off, and bear away!

630
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:17,390
向白帽湾进发!
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay!

631
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,390
航向白帽湾!
Bear on, Whitecap Bay!

632
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:36,860
来
Come.

633
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,310
喝点小酒?
Little drink?

634
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,710
美酒 音乐 蜡烛...
Wine, music, candlelight.

635
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,080
这种事我们早就做过 杰克
I think we've traveled down\nthis road before, Jack.

636
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,050
是啊 没错
Yes, we have.

637
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,420
我记得很清楚
I remember it well.

638
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:55,090
弯曲 扭曲 转身 摇摆 翻滚...
Winding, twisting and\nturning, gyrating, writhing.

639
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,560
再不停地翻滚
Incessant writhing.

640
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,560
记得圣多明哥吗?
Do you recall Saint Dominique?

641
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,560
马提尼克岛
La Martinique.

642
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,400
在圣多明哥我就想杀你了
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.

643
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,300
没所谓啊
Either or.

644
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,130
大副喝酒可不对啊
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

645
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:12,730
我是你第一个吗? 我一直在想
Was I the first? I've often wondered.

646
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,110
你有求于人的时候的样子真迷人
You can be so charming\nwhen you want something, Jack.

647
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,740
窍门是找出你想要什么
The trick is finding out what.

648
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,950
是真相 对不对?
The truth, then, is it?

649
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,150
黑胡子已经利用到了
Blackbeard has served his purpose.

650
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,620
我们俩去不老泉
You and I can go to\nthe Fountain together,

651
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,820
我们可以鸳鸯戏水  
where we shall bathe one another\nin equal shares of fame

652
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,990
尽享欢愉
and other assorted debaucheries.

653
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:37,120
而我会告诉你不老泉的仪式
And I'll tell you\nthe ritual of the Fountain.

654
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,100
是啊 淫荡的仪式
Yes. The profane ritual.

655
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,000
我能信任你吗 杰克?
Can I trust you, Jack?

656
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:49,580
- 我需要你支持我\n- 最亲爱的安洁莉卡
- I need you on my side.\n- Oh, my dearest Angelica.

657
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,140
我们是雌雄大盗啊 亲爱的
You and I are as\nthick as thieves, love.

658
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,520
告诉我规则
Tell me the rules.

659
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,320
不老泉的泉水
Water from the Fountain of Youth.

660
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,600
人鱼闪亮的泪水...
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.

661
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,030
庞德・里昂的银杯\nThe silver chalices of Ponce de Len.

662
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:13,700
有了这些...
With these items...

663
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,970
- 怎样?\n- 有了这些
- Yes?\n- With these items,

664
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:19,510
你就可以汲取他人的寿命 杰克
you may take all the years\nof life from another, Jack.

665
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,610
你知道那是什么意思
You know what that means.

666
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,650
你跟我 我们不能自己去 
We cannot go alone, you and I.

667
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,050
仪式需要一个牺牲者
The ritual requires a victim.

668
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:34,660
- 这也太不幸了啊\n- 是的
- That is unfortunate.\n- Yes, it is.

669
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,530
我对不老泉越发没兴趣了
I find my desire for the Fountain\ngreatly lessened.

670
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,560
但是船上有你想要的东西
But there is something onboard\nyou do want.

671
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,710
黑胡子怎么办?
What about Blackbeard?

672
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,440
他在航图室 我们必须动作快
He's in the chart room.\nWe'll have to be quick.

673
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,110
他把每一艘船都留作战利品
He keeps each ship as a prize.

674
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:11,350
你帮我 我保证你能从中选一艘
You help me,\nand I promise you your pick.

675
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,900
虽然我知道你会选择哪一艘
Though I think I know the one\nyou will choose.

676
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:23,260
瓶子里的黑珍珠?
The Black Pearl in a bottle?

677
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:25,140
黑珍珠怎么会在瓶子里?
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?

678
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,780
他在小模型里更讨人厌
He's even more annoying in miniature.

679
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,950
- 咱们成交了没 杰克?\n- 安洁莉卡 我了解你
- Do we have a deal, Jack?\n- Angelica, I know you.

680
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,960
你不会偷走一个无辜人的生命
You are not going to steal the life\nof some innocent man.

681
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,820
那个独腿人的生命怎样?
What about the one-legged man?

682
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,730
我需要时间 杰克
I need years, Jack.

683
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:52,970
不是为我自己而是为了我的父亲
Not for me. For my father.

684
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,910
我真的是黑胡子的女儿
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

685
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,110
你被自己的谎言给骗了 亲爱的
You've fallen for your own con, love.

686
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,510
不 他真的是我父亲
No, he is my father.

687
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,380
我跟你说的那些谎言 并不是谎言
The lies I told you were not lies.

688
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:10,050
你通过告诉我真相 骗了我?
You lied to me by telling me the truth?

689
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,180
- 是的\n- 不错嘛
- Yes.\n- That's very good.

690
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,790
- 我能这么做吗?\n- 不论如何 我确定你会的
- May I use that?\n- I'm sure you will, anyway.

691
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,290
当然了
Of course I will.

692
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,130
那你是不会放弃这个追求咯?
So, will you not give up this quest?

693
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:23,860
我想要个父亲 杰克 我没有过父亲
I want a father, Jack.\nI haven't had one.

694
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,400
安洁莉卡 你的父亲 黑胡子
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...

695
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,310
他是个魔鬼
...he is evil,

696
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,640
一有机会他就会杀了你
and he will kill you given the chance.

697
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,870
- 没人救得了他\n- 你凭什么决定
- He cannot be saved.\n- And who are you to set

698
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,210
谁能得救?
the limits on redemption?

699
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,680
你偷走了我的青春 杰克 你欠我的
You stole years of my life, Jack.\nYou owe me.

700
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,880
你这是在自寻死路
And you are en route\nto getting yourself killed,

701
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,360
我不能袖手旁观
and I am not inclined\nto stand by and watch.

702
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:52,220
白帽湾
Whitecap Bay!

703
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,830
所有人 上长船
All hands on deck!\nSet to the longboats!

704
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,830
把船停好
Lay 'em out flat!

705
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:11,310
别乱了 为了我们娇艳的客人 弄得漂亮点
No tangles. Make 'em look\npretty for our dainty guests.

706
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,250
我们需要亮光 很强的亮光
We're gonna need light.\nA lot of light.

707
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,050
走吧
Come!

708
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:45,080
闻到没有? 鲸鱼油 \n这东西烧起来就像神迹一样
Smell that? Whale oil.\nStuff burns like a miracle from God.

709
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,950
- 你能点燃灯塔吗?\n- 英国人做的
- Can you make it work?\n- Made by the English.

710
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,210
咱们还是别抱太大希望
Let's not get our hopes up.

711
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:03,200
夏天第一次新月旧月
The old moon in\nthe arms of the new one.

712
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,560
交替之时
First of the summer.

713
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,700
获取人鱼眼泪的最佳时机
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

714
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:24,890
我们死定了 他们会被人造亮光吸引过来
We're doomed.\nThey be drawn to man-made light.

715
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,720
- 鲨鱼?\n- 比鲨鱼还糟 小子
- Sharks?\n- Worse than sharks, boy.

716
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,380
一个时辰之内 人鱼就会被吸引过来
There'll be mermaids upon us\nwithin the hour,

717
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:33,990
相信我  我们就是诱饵
you mark my words.\nAnd we're the bait.

718
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,300
我听说 如果水手被人鱼亲吻之后 就不会被淹死
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid\nprotects a sailor from drowning.

719
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,310
别傻了 人鱼都是雌性的 孩子
Don't be a fool!\nMermaids are all female, son,

720
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,240
像天堂的梦境一样美妙
and lovely as a dream of heaven.

721
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:53,650
但如果到了进食的时候 
But when it comes time\nto churn butter, so to speak,

722
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,780
她们会把水手从小船
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

723
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,950
或者大船的甲板上拉下去 为所欲为
or off the deck of a ship,\nhave their way,

724
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:04,030
然后这些水手就会被拉入海底淹死 被吃掉
and then the sailors are pulled\nto bottom and drowned and eaten.

725
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,920
有时候 是反过来的
Or, sometimes, the other way around.

726
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,830
- 唱歌\n- 什么?
- Sing.\n- What?

727
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,330
他们喜欢听歌声
They like to hear singing.

728
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,270
我的名字叫玛利亚
My name is Maria

729
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:26,580
一个商人的女儿
A merchant's daughter fair

730
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,310
- 大点声 \n- 我离开了父母
- Louder.\n- And I have left my parents

731
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,650
每年3000英镑
And 3,000 pounds a year

732
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,820
我的心被丘比特的爱神之箭射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

733
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,400
我鄙视所有闪闪发光的金银珠宝
I disdain all glittering gold

734
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,020
除了那欢快勇敢的水手
There is nothing can console me

735
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:47,070
没有什么能够慰藉我
But my jolly sailor bold

736
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:52,800
我的心被丘比特的爱神之箭射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

737
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,640
我鄙视所有闪闪发光的金银珠宝
I disdain all glittering gold

738
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:59,510
除了我那快乐勇敢的水手
There is nothing can console me

739
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:04,150
没有什么能慰藉我
But my jolly sailor bold

740
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,560
主啊 拯救我
Lord save me.

741
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:30,300
哎 看 看那儿 
Man, look. Look there.

742
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,240
你会把她吓跑的
You'll scare her off!

743
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,910
是 那正好啊
Aye, and good riddance!

744
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,590
你会说话吗?
Can you talk?

745
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,790
会
Yes.

746
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,800
你好美
You're beautiful.

747
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,410
- 是你唱的歌儿吗?\n- 是的
- Are you the one who sings?\n- Aye.

748
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,750
你是我那快乐勇敢的水手吗?
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

749
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,210
- 是的 我是\n- 斯克罗姆  你冷静点!
- Aye, that I be.\n- Scrum, comport yourself!

750
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:11,540
兄弟们 我这短暂可怜的一生
Boys! There ain't much\nbeen given to me

751
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,090
没有得到过任何有价值的东西
in my brief, miserable life,\nthere's the truth in it.

752
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,950
可我可以告诉上帝
But, by God, I'll have it said

753
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:19,500
斯克罗姆 得到了一个漂亮美人鱼的亲吻
that Scrum had himself a kiss\nfrom a proper mermaid!

754
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:24,400
我的心被丘比特之箭射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

755
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,060
我鄙视所有闪闪发光的金银珠宝
I disdain all glittering gold

756
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:31,610
除了我那快乐勇敢的水手 
There is nothing can console me

757
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,840
没有什么可以使我感到慰藉
But my jolly sailor bold

758
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:40,840
所有的姐妹们 快来吧
Come all ye pretty fair maids

759

761
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:53,830
的欢快勇敢的水手
That ploughs the raging sea

762
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,100
我的心被丘比特之箭射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

除了我那欢快勇敢的水手

765
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:11,280
没什么能使我感到慰藉
But my jolly sailor bold

766
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:16,550
我的心被丘比特之剑射中
My heart is pierced by Cupid

767
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,950
我鄙视所有闪闪发光的金银珠宝
I disdain all glittering gold

768
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:24,150
除了我欢快勇敢的水手

But my jolly sailor bold

770
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,260
快看啊 开始啦

勇敢点 把她们赶到岸边去
Muster your courage!\nDrive 'em to shore!

773
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,630
撒网 快
Nets into the water! Quickly!

774
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:02,520
所有人 想活命 退到岸上去 
Retreat, all, to land!\nFor your lives!

775
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:07,290
我说了 撤退!
Retreat, I say!

776
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,450
胆小鬼 回到海里去!
Cowards! Back in the water!

777
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:13,790
回到岸上也无法活命 我保证
There be no refuge on land! On my word!

778
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:47,200
来呀

779
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,410
我们抓到一个
We got one!

780
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,060
我坠入爱河了
I'm in love!

781
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,230
查查受伤的
Check the wounded!

782
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,160
看看能不能找到一条还活着的人鱼
See if you can find\none mermaid still alive!

783
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,600
来 搭把手
Come, give a hand!

784
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,870
干得好 水手
Well done, sailor.

785
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,470
大家都看到了吗
Did everyone see that?

786
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:26,670
我可不会再来第二次
Because I will not be doing it again.

787
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:31,480
回船上 找个安全的内湾 快
Back to the ship.\nWe head for a protected cove. Now.

788
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:51,270
- 上帝啊 这是...?\n- 人鱼
- Lord. Is that?\n- Mermaid.

789
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:54,930
- 赶紧回头是岸\n- 回不了了
- Give up this madness now.\n- I cannot.

790
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:56,830
你有没有在海滩上走过
Ever walk on the beach,

791
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:59,280
回头看到沙滩上双足的留下的脚印?
look back and see your footsteps\nin the sand?

792
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:03,410
就跟这一样 只不过足迹\n不在我身后在我面前
It's like that,\nexcept the footsteps lie before me.

793
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:07,390
- 您是单足了\n- 去白帽湾 长官
- Footstep, actually.\n- Whitecap Bay, sir.

794
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:09,120
我们必须抓紧
We must hasten.

795
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:20,790
我们徒步前往的 \n吉布斯 给我指个方向
We travel by foot.\nGibbs, I require a heading.

796
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:24,100
- 但是 长官 船上还有人\n- 他们已经死了
- But, sir, the men.\n- They be dead already.

797
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:27,330
- 他们听上去不像是死了\n- 哦 是吗
- They don't sound dead.\n- Oh, is that so?

798
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,810
但我什么也没听到\n除了海鸥筑巢的声音
Well, I hear nothing\nbut seagulls nesting.

799
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:34,010
你听到了吗 格鲁乌先生?
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?

800
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:40,480
海鸥...筑巢
Seagulls... nesting.

801
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,680
- 没有其他的了\n- 方向 吉布斯?
- Nothing more.\n- Heading, Gibbs?

802
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,890
上帝啊
My God.

803
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:56,090
不给方向 就要你命
Your head or my heading.

804
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,430
两个一起也行 我不在乎
I'll have me one or t'other,\nI don't care which.

805
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:05,880
所有人 前进
All hands, forward!

806
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:25,820
- 交给你了 斯派洛\n- 有必要蒙眼吗
- It's to you now, Sparrow.\n- Was that really necessary?

807
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:28,600
最好别让你知道我船的准确位置
Best you not know the exact\nwhereabouts of my ship.

808
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:33,470
- 我是个谨慎的人\n- 我也是
- I be a cautious man.\n- So be I.

809
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:35,340
首先 我想找...
What I want first...

810
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,940
...庞德・里昂的船\n...is Ponce De Len's ship.

811
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:19,880
为什么要带她一起?
Why is it we've got to bring her along?

812
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:23,250
因为眼泪无法保存 需要新鲜的
Because tears don't keep.\nWe need them fresh.

813
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:26,120
仪式怎么搞来着?
What is the ritual again?

814
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,730
不老泉水加人鱼的眼泪?
Water from the Fountain\nand a mermaid's tear?

815
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,390
还有两尊银圣杯
And two silver chalices.

816
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:33,190
一尊有眼泪 一尊没有
One cup with a tear, one without.

817
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,870
这么说 两尊都盛泉水 其中一尊有眼泪?
So, one with a tear and water in both?

818
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:38,530
挺复杂的
Quite complicated, is it not?

819
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,730
两尊泉水 一尊眼泪
Both get water. One gets a tear.

820
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,540
喝有眼泪那尊的人
The person who drinks\nthe water with the tear

821
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:47,140
会得到另一个人全部寿命
gets all the years of life\nfrom the other.

822
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,410
多少年?
How many years?

823
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:54,820
已经活过的
All the years\nthat they have lived,

824
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,480
和还能活的年头 如果命运仁慈的话
and they could have lived,\nif fate had been kinder.

825
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,100
传教士
Clergyman.

826
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:14,010
万一我有个三长两短
On the off chance that this\ndoes not go well for me,

827
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,700
我想在此声明
I would like it noted here and now

828
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,110
我已经充分准备好接受必要的信仰
that I am fully prepared\nto believe in whatever I must,

829
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,010
以便得以进入
so that I may be\nwelcomed into that place

830
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:23,580
好人们才能到达的天堂 明白吗
where all the goody-goodies\nget to go. Savvy?

831
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,350
教会管这事有一个词 杰克\n你可以"皈依"
We have a word for that, Jack.\nYou can convert.

832
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:29,980
有需要再说吧
I was thinking more\nof an as-needed basis.

833
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,260
舵手
Quartermaster!

834
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:37,590
- 怎么?\n- 她不能呼吸了
- Aye?\n- She cannot breathe!

835
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,790
- 她有水\n- 她需要空气
- She has water.\n- She needs air!

836
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:46,670
- 打开\n- 她会逃跑的
- Open this.\n- She will escape.

837
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:50,540
- 你们会害死她的\n- 我支持传教士
- You're killing her.\n- I support the missionary's position.

838
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:00,150
看到了?
See?

839
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,890
继续前进
Onward.

840
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:34,540
跟我想的一样 不是这边
Just as I thought. Not this way!

841
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,060
就是这边 对吧
This is the way, isn't it?

842
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:41,030
当然 但是我们该绕路从东边走
'Course it is, but we\nshould go around to the east.

843
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,030
那样就错过圣杯的地点了
That would take us out of\nthe path of the chalices.

844
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,930
- 那我们再绕回来\n- 没时间了
- Well, then we'll circle back.\n- There is no time.

845
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:46,730
是你坚持要带人鱼的
You're the one who insisted\non bringing the bloody mermaid.

846
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:48,860
- 那你玩暴动也浪费时间了嘛\n- 你走路像姑娘
- Well, the mutiny didn't help.\n- You walk like a girl.

847
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,100
- 到底谁像\n- 必须有人去
- You would know.\n- Someone must go.

848
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:53,700
你是说分头行动?
You mean split up?

849
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,740
你是说跳过去?我等不及要看看了
You mean jump?\nThis I cannot wait to see.

850
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,870
斯派洛去 找到船 拿回圣杯
Sparrow will go.\nFind the ship, retrieve the chalices.

851
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:03,020
斯派洛? 万一他一去不回了呢
Sparrow? What makes you\nthink he will come back?

852
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,380
是啊 万一他一去不回了呢
Yes, what makes you think\nhe will come back?

853
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:09,010
我们不能相信他 父亲 我去
We cannot trust him, Father. I'll go.

854
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,590
她去
She'll go.

855
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,960
离不老泉还有多远?
How much farther to the Fountain?

856
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,790
我要没时间了
I'm running out of time.

857
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:22,930
大约朝北走一天 沿着那条河
About a day's march north,\nfollowing that river,

858
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:26,560
看到许多水塘时 就接近了
you'll get to a series of pools.\nThen you're close.

859
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,310
你去
You will go.

860
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:35,510
我就知道会这样
I was sure it would come to this.

861
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:53,260
知道站在高处偶尔会有一种感觉
You know that feeling you get sometimes\nwhen you're standing in a high place?

862
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,330
跳下去的冲动?
Sudden urge to jump?

863
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,800
我可没有
I don't have it.

864
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:01,730
我要圣杯
I need those chalices.

865
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,330
开枪吧 免得我摔死
Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.

866
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,540
你去 再回来
You will go. You will return...

867
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:10,840
...否则我杀了她
...or I will kill her.

868
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:15,180
你不会杀自己女儿的
You won't kill your own daughter.

869
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,120
舵手 再给我六把枪
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols,

870
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,850
把子弹都清空 只留两把的
remove the shot from all but two,

871
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:22,490
但别告诉我是哪两把
but do not tell me which two.

872
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:27,360
你来选 斯派洛先生
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.

873
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:31,330
不
No.

874
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:34,570
不
No.

875
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,510
- 是了\n- 你确定?
- Yes.\n- You're sure?

876
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:42,120
当然
'Course I am.

877
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,380
再来
Again.

878
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:55,450
拜托 肯定都是空的
Please, they're not even loaded.

879
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:01,660
再来
Again.

880
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,400
如果你真这么想看她死
If you're so keen on killing her,

881
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:06,940
- 不如让她跳?\n- 什么?
- why don't you just let her jump?\n- What?

882
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:10,200
如果你跳了 又死了
If you jump and die,

883
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:14,010
那就轮到她了
then she will have her chance.

884
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:15,620
再来
Again.

885
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:20,750
喂
Oi...

886
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:24,760
如果我跳下去 能活吗
...if I jump, will I survive?

887
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,430
娃娃
The doll.

888
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:49,510
- 是的 现在能活了\n- 胡闹 我去
- Yes, now you will survive.\n- This is nonsense! I'm going!

889
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,470
湿了 又湿了
Wet. Wet again.

890
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:16,680
我们继续 正北去不老泉
We go on.\nDue north to the Fountain.

891
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:18,880
演得好 父亲
Well played, Father.

892
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:22,950
你知道哪两把上膛了 是吧
You knew which guns were loaded, right?

893
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,640
当然 亲爱的
Of course, my love.

894
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:40,030
有地图就好了
Be nice to have a map about now.

895
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,830
有船就好了
Or a ship.

896
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:46,300
停下 别动
Stop! Hold very still.

897
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:51,270
别让它碰你的皮肤
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.

898
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:03,250
怎么 老年人不能有点爱好吗
What? What be wrong with\nan older man having a hobby?

899
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,920
还停着干什么 继续走啊
What are you stopping for, eh? Push on!

900
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:08,260
- 前进\n- 死了以后有的是时间睡
- Push on!\n- You can sleep when you're dead.

901
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,590
前进
Push on!

902
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:14,530
幸运女神继续眷顾我们
Fortune continues to favor us.

903
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,530
圣地亚哥号
The Santiago.

904
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:47,400
船长是著名的庞德・里昂\nFamously captained by Ponce de Len.

905
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:51,640
没有其他人了
There's no one there.

906
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:52,760
好吧
Right, then.

907
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,870
不能停下
We must not stop.

908
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,680
你自己走
You will walk.

909
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,970
我走不了
I cannot.

910
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:01,900
不走就死
Walk or die.

911
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:09,580
手臂环住我
Put your arms around me.

912
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:13,120
- 我没要你帮忙\n- 但你需要
- I do not ask for help.\n- But you need it.

913
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:34,340
- 我们不是赶时间吗\n- 别掉队
- We're in a hurry, yes?\n- Do not fall behind.

914
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,420
停在这里 等我命令
Hold here 'til I say!

915
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,340
真美
Such beauty.

916
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,810
你一定是上帝的造物
Surely you're one of\nGod's own creations,

917
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:16,880
而且不是那些诺亚方舟上没有一席之地的
and not a descendant\nof those dark creatures

918
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,320
可怕怪物的后裔
who found no refuge on the Ark.

919
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:24,220
真美
Such beauty...

920
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:27,120
...但致命
...and yet deadly.

921
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:31,550
- 致命?没有\n- 你袭击了我
- Deadly? No.\n- You attacked me.

922
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:36,660
不 你不一样
No. You are different.

923
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:38,800
不一样?
Different?

924
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:42,930
不是吗 你保护了我
Are you not? You protect.

925
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:47,400
难道你...?
Did you?

926
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:51,850
你把我从爆炸中推开了
You pushed me down out of the way.

927
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:57,480
- 看到不老泉了?\n- 还没 不过接近了
- You see the Fountain?\n- No, but we are close.

928
01:22:58,030 --> 01:22:59,890
把怪物带来 蒙住脸
Bring the creature.\nCover its head.

929
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:02,020
她有名字
She has a name!

930
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:08,060
请指教
Pray tell.

931
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:16,170
她叫司瑞娜
She is Syrena.

932
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,640
庞德・里昂\nPonce de Len.

933
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,020
40个海盗40晚梦到的宝藏
If 40 pirates\ndreamt 40 nights of treasure,

934
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:09,750
也比不上这间屋里的东西
it would not match\nthe contents of this room.

935
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,450
你
You.

936
01:24:14,230 --> 01:24:16,030
- 你\n- 不...
- You.\n- No...

937
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,470
- ...你\n- 我先来的
...you.\n- I was here first.

938
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:23,630
- 你 为什么来这?\n- 黑胡子派我来的
- You, why are you here?\n- Blackbeard sent me.

939
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:26,270
- 你呢?\n- 银圣杯
- Why are you?\n- Silver chalices

940
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:29,780
- 给我的陛下\n- 哦 得了吧
- for my royal liege.\n- Oh, please.

941
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:32,820
后退后退 要保持平衡
Back, back! We have to balance it out!

942
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:37,380
船会整个滑下去
The whole ship will slide!

943
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,790
好吧
Right, then.

944
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:48,870
不如我们各选一样等重的东西?
What if we each choose an item\nof approximately equal weight?

945
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:52,970
放回去
Put it back!

946
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:56,530
什么也别碰
We touch nothing!

947
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:05,420
那个呢?
What about that?

948
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:07,950
圣杯
The chalices.

949
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:11,180
喂 凭什么你先看
Oi! Why do you get to look first?

950
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:13,020
好吧
Fine, then.

951
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,840
- 一起\n- 一起
- Together.\n- Together.

952
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:37,570
石头
Rocks.

953
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:40,020
西班牙人
The Spanish.

954
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,420
他们抢先了
They're ahead of us, mate.

955
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:46,590
我要看一眼地图 如果是我担心的情况...
I shall have a look at that map.\nIf it's what I fear...

956
01:25:56,670 --> 01:25:58,900
奇怪 为什么他们没带走
I wonder why they left this behind.

957
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:05,680
别碰地图
Don't touch the map.

958
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:12,110
他们认识路
They know the path,

959
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:16,150
不过我知道他们会在哪儿安营扎寨
but I can also see where\nthey'll most likely make camp.

960
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,930
杰克
Jack!

961
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:38,270
吉布斯 我正要去救你出狱
Gibbs, I was just on me way\nto break you out of jail.

962
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:41,740
你偷了我的地图
You stole my map.

963
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,750
好了 可以开始了
Right. Best be started.

964
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:49,310
好
Ol?

965
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:08,200
人鱼
Mermaids.

966
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,980
小心 水塘很深
Careful, these pools run deep.

967
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:17,680
如果她跑了 就前功尽弃 舵手
If she escapes, all is lost.\nQuartermaster.

968
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:22,620
看啊
Look. Look!

969
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:27,160
绑在这儿等死 被太阳暴晒
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.

970
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:30,890
只有半身浸在水里 无法活命
Only half in the water.\nNot enough to live,

971
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:35,230
但能延缓死亡速度
but just enough to make the dying slow.

972
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,460
好好想想
Think on it.

973
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:41,010
你的族人被杀了\n就为了他们的眼泪
Your people, murdered,\nharvested for their tears.

974
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:45,480
司瑞娜 你不想哭妈
Syrena, won't you cry?

975
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:48,180
所有人都会死 连你也是
All die, even you.

976
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,770
- 我听说快了\n- 听着...
- Soon, I hear.\n- Listen...

977
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:55,690
听着
Listen.

978
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:59,160
你听不到你的姐妹在尖叫吗
Can you not hear your sisters scream?

979
01:27:59,290 --> 01:28:01,730
你没听到么
Do you not hear them?

980
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:05,560
我们只需要一滴眼泪
We need but one tear.

981
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,730
下等生物!
Vile creature!

982
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:12,460
- 把她的手指一根一根砍下来!\n- 掐死她!
- Chop off her fingers, one by one!\n- Choke her!

983
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:15,200
把眼睛挖出来取出眼泪
Cut out the tears\nfrom behind the eyes!

984
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:16,670
你怎么不说话
Where's your voice in this?

985
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:20,570
也许等太阳出来她就会改变主意了
Maybe she'll have a change of heart\nwhen the sun rises.

986
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:24,620
嗯 是的 她会被灼伤\n但是我等不及了
Oh, aye, she will burn,\nbut I cannot wait for the sun.

987
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:26,480
也许我们应该烧死她
Perhaps we should build a fire.

988
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:28,750
- 不行\n- 别反抗我 传道士
- No.\n- Do not contest me, cleric.

989
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:31,950
- 你们不能折磨她\n- 我们只需要一滴眼泪
- You will not torture her.\n- We need only one tear.

990
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:35,250
如果有必要\n我会把她身上的鳞片一片片拔下来
I will tear every scale\nfrom her body one by one if I see fit.

991
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:36,950
如果这让你不快 一边祷告去吧
If that displeases you, go pray.

992
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:40,220
我错了 不是所有的灵魂都能得到救赎\n你的就不行
I was wrong. Not every soul\ncan be saved. Yours cannot.

993
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:43,230
看啊 伙计们\n一个曾经坚持信仰的人
Behold, gentlemen,\na man formerly of faith.

994
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:46,270
你口中的下等生物 比你好百倍
That vile creature, as you call her,\nis worth a hundred of you.

995
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:48,170
哎呦 你关心她
Oh, you care for her?

996
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:52,200
你喜欢她
You fancy her.

997
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,610
我看得清清楚楚 不用否认了
And do not deny what is\nclear to my eyes.

998
01:28:58,420 --> 01:28:59,540
问题是...
Question is...

999
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,710
...她喜欢你么?
...does she fancy you?

1000
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,560
我的天哪 她喜欢 我们走运了
By God, she does. We are in luck!

1001
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:13,870
快流下眼泪...
Bring forth a tear...

1002
01:29:15,370 --> 01:29:17,890
...否则就见证这可怜人的死亡吧
...or witness the death\nof this poor soul.

1003
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:23,480
司瑞娜 如果你能落泪
Syrena, if you could manage a tear,

1004
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:25,200
我会很感激
I would be grateful.

1005
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:28,140
难过 那就对了
Sadness, yes,

1006
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:33,690
- 但还不是悲伤... 还不是\n- 爸爸!你不要动手
- but no sorrow... yet.\n- Not by your hand, Father!

1007
01:29:33,850 --> 01:29:36,480
时间和潮水不等人\n舵手
Time and tide wait for none.\nQuartermaster.

1008
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,290
啊 人鱼真无情
Aye, mermaids are tough.

1009
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,460
真不简单啊
The lot of them.

1010
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:59,010
像她们一样把她绑起来\n然后把这东西丢掉
Tie her up like the others.\nAnd get rid of this.

1011
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:06,580
- 你有信心么\n- 是的
- You are confident?\n- Yes.

1012
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:09,680
我是女人 她也是
I am a woman. So is she.

1013
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,720
你在玩什么把戏 杰克?\n居然跟巴博萨联手
What's your play, Jack?\nThrowing in with Barbossa.

1014
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,600
有个女孩...
There is a girl...

1015
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:26,930
...一个女人... 异性
...a female... of the opposite sex.

1016
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:31,000
- 你什么时候没有过女人\n- 也许我应该说"落难少女"
- When is there not?\n- Perhaps I should say "damsel."

1017
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:34,170
你在救一个落难少女\n好吧 这还是第一次
You're rescuing a damsel?\nWell, there's a first.

1018
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:37,550
是的 就是 我可能在很久之前
Yes, but it's just that\nI may have caused said damsel

1019
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:41,280
- 对这个落难少女造成了伤害\n- 快说
- some manner of harm many moons ago.\n- Out with it.

1020
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:44,720
吉布斯 这是那个赛维尔女人
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.

1021
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:48,860
啊 就是那个你假装爱她\n然后离开了 伤了她的心的那个
Ah, you pretended to love her,\nthen you left her and broke her heart.

1022
01:30:48,930 --> 01:30:53,630
更糟糕的是 我可能曾经有过\n稍微的 怎么说...
Worse. I may have had,\nbriefly, mind you...

1023
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,970
...涟漪\n- 涟漪?
...stirrings.\n- Stirrings?

1024
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:03,070
- 涟漪\n- 什么?你的意思是 感情?
- Stirrings.\n- What? Like feelings, you mean?

1025
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:06,240
不不不 没到感情那种程度\n更像是...
No, no, no. Not quite all the way\nto feelings. More like...

1026
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:11,980
好吧 感情 你个混蛋
All right, feelings, damn you.

1027
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:16,780
但你还是离开她了\n真卑鄙
And you left her still.\nThat's low.

1028
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:19,450
谢谢
Thank you.

1029
01:31:26,370 --> 01:31:27,800
只可智取不要蛮干
Stealth over force.

1030
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:31,700
考虑到你的情况 接下来就交给我吧
I'll take it from here\non account of your condition.

1031
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:34,700
你的假肢没被白蚁蛀坏了吧?
You don't have termites, do you?

1032
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,810
杰克 感谢你的关心
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

1033
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:39,470
但我要一直陪着你
but I'll be keeping\nyou company all the same.

1034
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:42,710
待在这里 指挥官\n等我信号
Hold here, Lieutenant Commander.\nWait for my signal.

1035
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,770
那里 那个人 他应该是头儿
There. That one.\nThat be the leader.

1036
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,410
记住他的帐篷 因为那里...
Make note of his tent\nbecause that's where...

1037
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:25,120
不 等等 天哪\n那一定就是它们了
No, wait. By God,\nthat must be them right there.

1038
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:30,860
你的剑有股怪味
Your sword smells funny.

1039
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:35,930
是的 涂了毒蟾蜍内脏的毒
Aye. Poison from the\ninnards of poisonous toads.

1040
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:39,160
只要轻轻一划 几分钟之后你就死了
Just a scratch,\nyou're a dead man in minutes.

1041
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:41,640
你介意把剑指向那边么
Would you mind pointing it\nthe other way?

1042
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:43,540
我不喜欢蟾蜍
I don't like toads.

1043
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:51,850
- 你在干嘛?\n- 研究逃跑路线
- What are you doing?\n- Planning an escape route.

1044
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:56,080
- 你通常不都这么做么?\n- 是的
- Isn't that how you do it?\n- Yes.

1045
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:59,320
但有时候我会... 随机应变
Or sometimes I just... improvise.

1046
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,810
现在呢?
Now what?

1047
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:31,210
我们就这么走出去 冷静 慢慢地
We stroll out, slow and steady.

1048
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,190
像是自己人一样
Just like we belong.

1049
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:36,890
- 司瑞娜 我很抱歉\n- 菲利普 你还活着
- I'm sorry, Syrena.\n- Philip, you're alive.

1050
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:41,220
- 是的\n- 你回来救我了
- Yes.\n- You came for me.

1051
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,590
为什么?
Why?

1052
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:49,000
你是不同的 不是么?
You're different, are you not?

1053
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:55,570
你不是很善良么?有同情心
Do you know not of kindness?\nCompassion?

1054
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:14,750
悲伤的眼泪 从来没有过
Tears of sorrow, never.

1055
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:17,330
人鱼太无情了
Mermaids be too tough for that.

1056
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,620
但欢乐的眼泪...
But tears of joy...

1057
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:23,570
他们说这种反而更有效
They say these be\nthe more potent anyway.

1058
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:26,660
司瑞娜 相信我 我并不知情
Syrena, on my word,\nI had no part in this.

1059
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:29,370
放了她\n你们现在不需要她了
Let her go.\nYou don't need her now.

1060
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:32,480
放了她? 不行
Let her go? No.

1061
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:35,600
把她绑好\n我们把她扔在这儿
Secure her bonds.\nWe leave her with her own.

1062
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:47,150
逃跑路线是怎样的?
How's that escape route working?

1063
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:50,260
现在是你随机应变的机会了
Here's your chance to improvise.

1064
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,690
我也想呀
I'm attempting it.

1065
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:54,660
我可能可以挣脱出一只手
I might be able to get a hand loose.

1066
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,070
哎呦 你有刀 太好了
Oh, you got a knife.\nThat's very good.

1067
01:35:58,170 --> 01:35:59,700
还有更好的
Better.

1068
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:06,410
我也要喝一口
I want one of those.

1069
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:15,350
敬报仇 甜美畅快
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.

1070
01:36:15,490 --> 01:36:19,950
- 报仇?\n- 别装了
- Revenge?\n- Come, come, Hector.

1071
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:21,490
如果你想要圣杯
If you wanted the chalices,

1072
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:24,320
你已经知道它们被拿走了
you'd seen they were missing and gone.

1073
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:27,630
你只是在坐等黑胡子
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.

1074
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,830
乔治王 私掠船 假发
King George. Privateer. Wig.

1075
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:35,410
演得太假了
Cheap theatrical facade.

1076
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,410
- 我才不信\n- 那个晚上你不在场
- I'm not buying it.\n- You weren't there that night.

1077
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:42,380
- 黑珍珠号丢了的那晚?\n- 被抢走了 不是丢了
- When the Pearl was lost?\n- Taken, not lost.

1078
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:49,110
我们刚离开海地岛海岸就被攻击了
We were off the coast of Hispaniola\nwhen we came under attack.

1079
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:52,720
没有挑衅 没有警告\n也没有谈判的机会
No provocation nor warning\nnor offer of parley.

1080
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:55,520
我们被炮火攻击
We were peppered with cannon fire.

1081
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:59,890
然后黑珍珠号下方的海水开始变浑浊
And then the sea beneath\nthe Pearl began to roil.

1082
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:03,870
船晃得很厉害
The Pearl was pitching\nand yawing violently.

1083
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,870
每个木板 每个栏杆
Every plank, every rail,

1084
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:08,870
每个侧板 同时开始吱吱作响
every spar, all at once,\nbegan to creak.

1085
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:12,030
船上的缆绳像有生命一样
The rigging had come to life.

1086
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:14,870
我们的船居然跟我们自己作对...
Our own ship turned against us...

1087
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:18,280
...绑着我们的船员\n像蛇一样绑着他们
...tangling the crew,\nwrapping around 'em like snakes.

1088
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:20,820
还缠上了我的腿
And wrapping around me leg.

1089
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:23,390
但我的手是自由的 手里还握着剑
But me arms were free\nand me sword was to hand.

1090
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,050
我才是船的主人 不是黑胡子
I am the master of me ship,\nnot Blackbeard.

1091
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:30,690
我是自己命运的主人 不是黑胡子
I am the master of my fate,\nnot Blackbeard.

1092
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:34,060
所以我做了我需要做的事
So I did what needed done.

1093
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:42,840
我活下来了
I survived.

1094
01:37:44,410 --> 01:37:48,610
所以... 你不是冲着泉水去的
So... you're not after the Fountain.

1095
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:52,410
我才不管乔治王\n或是什么乱七八糟的谣言
I care not for King George\nor tavern yarns

1096
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:54,780
说可以治愈四肢
that give hope for a healed limb.

1097
01:37:56,420 --> 01:38:00,090
我甚至愿意牺牲我的左手\n换取杀了黑胡子的机会
But I'd give my left arm\nfor a chance at Blackbeard.

1098
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:03,260
- 不是你的右手\n- 我需要我好用的手
- Not your right?\n- I need me good arm

1099
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:08,060
用毒箭剑穿他的心脏
to drive my poisoned blade\nthrough his heart.

1100
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,470
伙计 你会有机会的
I'll see you get the chance, mate.

1101
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:31,550
囚犯要逃跑啦
The prisoner's escaping.

1102
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:41,520
他要跑了!散开! 找到他!
He's escaping!\nFan out! Find him!

1103
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:42,750
走!快走!
Go! Go!

1104
01:39:44,830 --> 01:39:47,700
别开枪!我要抓活的!
Hold your fire! I want him alive!

1105
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:57,880
我觉得那就是你的信号了
I figured that was the signal.

1106
01:40:40,950 --> 01:40:44,450
- 走! 准备出发!\n- 敌人很快就会找到我们
- Go! Prepare to move out!\n- The enemy is soon upon us.

1107
01:40:46,190 --> 01:40:49,130
杰克 抱歉没拿到圣杯\n但我在赶时间
I'm sorry about the chalices, Jack,\nbut I've an appointment to keep.

1108
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:52,250
- 我不会回去拿的\n- 没这个必要
- I'll not be going back.\n- No need.

1109
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:55,420
- 要不要来一杯?\n- 我们去不老泉喝
- Shall we have a drink?\n- We'll drink at the Fountain.

1110
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:17,350
为什么我们每次见面\n你都是拿着什么东西指着我?
How is it we can never meet\nwithout you pointing something at me?

1111
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,460
斯派洛 你拿到圣杯了么?
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?

1112
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:23,190
是的 喂!
Aye. Oi!

1113
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:29,790
- 你还带了个朋友\n- 是的
- I see you brought a friend.\n- I did.

1114
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:33,170
那个独腿男人也在附近 是吧?
And the one-legged man, he is near.\nAye?

1115
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:34,710
是
Aye.

1116
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:36,530
好了...
Now...

1117
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:39,510
在我把它们给你之前我有一两个条件
Before I go just handing them over,\nI do have one or two conditions.

1118
01:41:39,650 --> 01:41:41,700
- 说\n- 首先
- Name them.\n- Firstly,

1119
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:44,210
把我的指南针还我\n不 不 那是其次
I'll be having me compass back.\nNo, no, that's secondly.

1120
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:46,610
首先 你得遵守承诺
Firstly, upon your word,

1121
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,710
不能伤害安洁莉卡
you will bring no harm to Angelica.

1122
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:51,220
斯派洛 我不想做任何对你有益的承诺
I'll make no vows\nto the likes of you, Sparrow.

1123
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,830
但承认我根本就不想伤害她
But it costs me nothing to admit

1124
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:56,830
对我并没有任何损失
that she was never in harm's way.

1125
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:59,660
那么其次 比首先更重要的是
Secondly then, priorly firstly,

1126
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,430
把我的指南针还我
I will be having me compass back.

1127
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:04,360
拜托了? 那是我应得的
Please? I do deserve it.

1128
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:08,000
你知道抓住那只死肥猪有多难么?
Do you have any idea how difficult\nit was to catch that filthy pig?

1129
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,510
不是那个大只的 那个四条腿的
Not the big one,\nthe four-legged one.

1130
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:17,710
谢谢 第三 胡子先生
Thank you. And thirdly, Mr. Beard,

1131
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:20,550
我有的时候 虽然不是很经常
there are times, not very often,

1132
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:23,780
也会反省我犯下的恶行
when I do reflect\nupon my heinous misdeeds.

1133
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:28,220
首当其冲就是\n我有多么对不起吉布斯先生
Chief among them, I note how poorly\nI have treated Mr. Gibbs,

1134
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:31,020
- 我忠诚的大副\n- 对啊! 现在你才想起这茬...
- my loyal first mate.\n- Aye! Now you bring it up...

1135
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:33,860
我让他在监狱中腐烂\n根本不在乎他
Left him to rot in jail, I did.\nDidn't care.

1136
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,660
现在也不 但重点是\n你得放他走
Still don't. But, point being,\nyou must let him go free.

1137
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:43,870
- 就这样?\n- 是的
- Is that it?\n- I think so.

1138
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:46,700
快决定吧 不然猪就要跑了\n你们得自己去找圣杯 祝你们好运
Quick, or the pig runs,\nand good luck getting those chalices.

1139
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:48,210
杰克 如果是你 我一定会...
Jack, if it's all the same to you,\nI'd be just as...

1140
01:42:48,350 --> 01:42:49,680
好的
Done.

1141
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:51,010
放了那头猪
Release the swine.

1142
01:42:56,790 --> 01:43:00,050
其实如果你们不介意\n我可以跟你们一段...
Perhaps, if you don't mind,\nI could tag along with you folk for a...

1143
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,060
伙计 这会指引你奔向自由
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

1144
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:14,600
我发誓应该就在这附近
I could have swore it was\nsomewhere right around here.

1145
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:47,060
我们不能停下
We must not stop.

1146
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:05,820
死路
Dead end.

1147
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:08,750
死路
Dead. End.

1148
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:10,850
死路
Dead end.

1149
01:45:11,890 --> 01:45:14,860
杰克 我开始有种\n你不知道自己在往哪儿走的感觉
Jack, I'm starting to think\nyou don't know where you're going.

1150
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:18,490
大家都说旅程比目的地更重要
It is not the destination\nso much as the journey, they say.

1151
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:21,170
拜托把圣杯给我
Chalices, if you please.

1152
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:34,700
后退
Stand back.

1153
01:45:57,070 --> 01:45:58,630
杰克...
Jack...

1154
01:45:58,770 --> 01:46:00,710
...你有没有 真的...
...have you ever, in fact...

1155
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:06,330
...亲眼见到...不老泉?
...seen with your own eyes...\nthe Fountain of Youth?

1156
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:08,670
抱歉 你能重复一遍你的问题么?
I'm sorry, could you\nrepeat the question, please?

1157
01:46:08,850 --> 01:46:10,310
舵手
Quartermaster.

1158
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:12,220
不 不!
No, no!

1159
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:18,020
等等 等等!
Wait, wait! Wait.

1160
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:25,750
"生命...之水"
"Aqua... de Vida."

1161
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:07,630
斯克鲁姆先生...
Master Scrum...

1162
01:47:07,770 --> 01:47:10,640
- 你可不可以...?\n- 阁下?
...do you mind?\n- Squire?

1163
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:11,330
真漂亮
So beautiful.

1164
01:48:50,810 --> 01:48:53,440
斯派洛 我要成为第一个尝泉水的人
Sparrow, I'll be the first\nto taste those waters.

1165
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:59,510
爸爸
Father.

1166
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:05,090
独腿男人
The one-legged man.

1167
01:49:07,630 --> 01:49:11,590
- 你带他来了\n- 我会这么做么?
- You brought him here.\n- Would I do that?

1168
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:13,820
爱德华・汀奇!
Edward Teach!

1169
01:49:13,970 --> 01:49:17,270
你在公海上犯下的罪
For crimes committed on the high seas,

1170
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:21,270
我以国王陛下授予我的权力...
by the authority granted me\nby His Majesty the King...

1171
01:49:21,410 --> 01:49:24,600
...伴随着很大一部分的个人成就感...
...and with a goodly amount\nof personal satisfaction...

1172
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:27,800
...我宣布你现在将被法院拘留
...I hereby place you\nin the custody of the court,

1173
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:31,280
成为我的囚犯
and declare you to be my prisoner.

1174
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:35,840
我玩完了 是吧?
My trick's out, is that it?

1175
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:40,430
所犯的罪行包括但不局限于\n海上抢劫 叛国
Such crimes do include, but are not\nlimited to, piracy, treason,

1176
01:49:40,530 --> 01:49:44,690
谋杀 还有最恶劣的是虐待
murder, torture of\nthe most heinous sort,

1177
01:49:44,830 --> 01:49:48,770
包括残忍的偷盗了一只\n用过的扭曲的多毛的右脚
including the brutal theft of one used,\ntwisted, hairy right leg.

1178
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:54,230
你... 敢与此剑为敌?
You... dare face this sword?

1179
01:49:54,410 --> 01:49:56,840
离你的船这么远的地方? 当然
This far away from your ship? Aye.

1180
01:49:56,980 --> 01:50:01,710
嗯 我感到我颈后命运的冷酷呼吸
Aye. That be the cold breath\nof fate I feel down my nape.

1181
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:07,510
但我将以主之名最后一战
But I'll have one last fight, by God.

1182
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:09,380
杀了他们!
Kill 'em all!

1183
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:12,820
稍等一下
Hang on a minute.

1184
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:16,860
我... 我想弄明白点事情
I just... I just need\nto understand something.

1185
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,360
好吧 所以 你们要打他们
Right, so, you will fight against them,

1186
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:21,830
他们要打你们
they will fight against you.

1187
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:25,660
只因为他想杀他?
All on account of him\nwanting to kill him?

1188
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:29,740
有道理么? 就是说嘛
Where is the sense? Exactly.

1189
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:33,610
要我说 让他们俩自己打去
I say, let them fight\neach other while we lay back,

1190
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:37,220
而我们就靠边看着 喝点小酒\n赌赌输赢!
watch, have a drink,\nplace some wagers!

1191
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:39,610
好啊
Aye.

1192
01:50:42,190 --> 01:50:43,810
- 杀了他们!\n- 绝不留情!
- Kill 'em!\n- No quarter!

1193
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:15,950
滚开!
Get off me!

1194
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:49,950

1196
01:51:57,230 --> 01:51:58,420
打啊!
Fight!

1197
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:02,890
交出来 人鱼的眼泪\n这才是好孩子
Hand it over. The tear.\nThere's a good lad.

1198
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,330
比起你 我更怕她
I'm more afraid of her\nthan I am of you.

1199
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,280
交出来\n这才是好孩子
Hand it over.\nThere's a good lad.

1200
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:20,380
- 拜托把圣杯给我\n- 杰克 抱歉
- The chalices, if you please.\n- Sorry, Jack.

1201
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:24,780
我告诉过你 我需要多点寿命\n现在 用你的就可以了
I told you, I need years.\nAnd now, yours will do.

1202
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:33,930
斯克鲁姆!
Scrum!

1203
01:52:55,590 --> 01:52:57,050
司瑞娜...
Syrena...

1204
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:03,560
主啊 你不能带她走
Oh God, you will not take her.

1205
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:08,660
如果你带走了她 请让她回来
If you have taken her,\nyou will give her back.

1206
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:11,170
让她回来...
Give her back...

1207
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:14,170
让她回来 拜托
Give her back, please. Please.

1208
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,530
我还以为命运会让我多打一会儿呢 嗯?
I expected fate\nto put up more of a fight, eh?

1209
01:53:57,380 --> 01:54:01,180
我把你打倒了 如果是我就笑不出来了
I will not have that smile\non your face as I strike you down.

1210
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:05,680
看看吧 爱德华・汀奇
Take a gander, Edward Teach.

1211
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:39,520
这片土地将永远属于光荣的
This land is hereby forever\nclaimed in the glorious name

1212
01:54:39,690 --> 01:54:42,250
乔治王陛下名下...
of His Majesty King George...

1213
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:51,440
来人呐 记下这人的勇敢
Someone make a note\nof that man's bravery.

1214
01:54:58,410 --> 01:55:02,140
女士 请把圣杯给我\nSeorita, the chalices, por favor.

1215
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:24,500
只有上帝才能赐予永恒的生命\n而不是这异教的水
Only God can grant eternal life,\nnot this pagan water.

1216
01:55:35,550 --> 01:55:39,040
来人 把这亵渎神的庙毁掉!
Men, destroy this profane temple!

1217
01:55:41,790 --> 01:55:43,120
不老泉!
The Fountain!

1218
01:55:57,170 --> 01:55:58,690
你个白痴
You are a fool.

1219
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:02,140
你在这里所寻找的东西\n只有信仰才能给你
You seek in this place\nwhat only faith can provide.

1220
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:04,800
信仰? \n信仰给你光明让你看见
Faith? In faith,\nthere is light enough to see

1221
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:07,170
却也足够黑暗让你失明
but darkness enough to blind.

1222
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:13,050
这是为什么?
What devilry is this?

1223
01:56:17,020 --> 01:56:19,620
- 这是为了黑珍珠号\n- 你做了什么?
- For the Pearl.\n- What have you done?

1224
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:25,560
安洁莉卡! 不要! 剑上有毒!
Angelica! Don't! It's poison!

1225
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,530
如果不是有点毒液优势
I'm not such the fool\nto take on Blackbeard

1226
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:36,070
我才不会蠢到去单挑黑胡子
without a little venomous advantage.

1227
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:38,870
杰克!
Jack!

1228
01:56:50,690 --> 01:56:52,750
我宣布黑胡子的船和船员
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,

1229
01:56:52,890 --> 01:56:56,330
以及这把剑\n是对我失去的肢体的赔偿!
and this sword,\npayment for my missing limb!

1230
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:12,140
抓好了! 拉!
Hang on! Pull!

1231
01:57:57,420 --> 01:57:59,790
别浪费了我的眼泪
Do not waste my tear.

1232
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:31,380
喝下它 这杯是有眼泪的
Drink this.\nThis one has the tear.

1233
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,510
- 你得喝下另一杯\n- 不!
- You must drink the other.\n- No!

1234
01:58:34,290 --> 01:58:37,520
我没办法同时救你们俩\n你们中有一个人得牺牲自己
I cannot save you both.\nOne of you must sacrifice.

1235
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:41,560
爸爸 你喝吧 以拯救你的灵魂
You take it, Father, for your soul.

1236
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:49,040
汀奇船长\n她快死了 你得救救你女儿
Captain Teach, she's dying.\nYou must save your daughter.

1237
01:58:50,210 --> 01:58:53,010
这杯是夺去生命的?
This one takes life?

1238
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:55,010
这杯有眼泪是赐予生命的?
This one has the tear and gives life?

1239
01:58:55,150 --> 01:58:56,410
是的 快啊!
Aye, hurry!

1240
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:09,590
安洁莉卡...\n救救我 我的孩子
Angelica...\nSave me, my child.

1241
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:12,930
不
No.

1242
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:23,070
爸爸 我爱你
I love you, Father.

1243
01:59:36,050 --> 01:59:37,680
等等
Wait a minute.

1244
01:59:39,860 --> 01:59:42,690
事实上 可能搞反了
In fact, it might have been\nthe other way around.

1245
01:59:43,530 --> 01:59:47,360
这杯有眼泪 那个是另一杯
This cup had the tear,\nthat one had the other bit.

1246
01:59:47,470 --> 01:59:48,730
骗子!
Trickster!

1247
01:59:48,870 --> 01:59:50,730
- 恶魔!\n- 爸爸!
- Devil!\n- Father!

1248
01:59:57,740 --> 01:59:59,270
你个混蛋! 你怎么能这样?
You bastard! How could you?

1249
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:01,750
你爸爸救了你
Your father saved you.

1250
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:04,410
他的灵魂也许这样就能被救赎了 恩?
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

1251
02:01:05,210 --> 02:01:07,340
你受伤了
You are hurt.

1252
02:01:09,550 --> 02:01:11,480
只是身体上
In body only.

1253
02:01:13,150 --> 02:01:17,380
我的心很平静... 因为你
My mind is at peace...\nbecause of you.

1254
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:21,320
- 我?    \n- 是的
- Me?\n- Yes.

1255
02:01:22,330 --> 02:01:24,730
我迷失过
I was lost.

1256
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:30,360
那海风 那潮汐...
The wind, the tides...

1257
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:33,560
...它们本会改变一个人的信仰
...they ought to renew a man's faith.

1258
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:37,070
但对于我来说 只有你能
But for me, only you.

1259
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:41,710
菲利普 我可以救你
Philip, I can save you.

1260
02:01:41,850 --> 02:01:44,820
你只需要开口
You need only ask.

1261
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:51,050
- 我只追寻一件事\n- 什么?
- I seek but one thing.\n- What is that?

1262
02:01:52,060 --> 02:01:54,420
原谅
Forgiveness.

1263
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:57,890
如果不是因为我 你根本不会被抓
If not for me, you would\nnever have been captured.

1264
02:01:58,030 --> 02:01:59,690
开口吧
Ask.

1265
02:02:01,570 --> 02:02:03,400
原谅我?
Forgive me?

1266
02:02:28,530 --> 02:02:29,750
我恨你
I hate you.

1267
02:02:29,890 --> 02:02:32,230
救了你一命的家伙?
The bloke who saved your life?

1268
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:35,560
我拥有的寿命是从我亲生父亲那里偷来的!
The years I possess,\nstolen from my own father!

1269
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:38,730
我只是帮了黑胡子做了\n任何父亲都会做的事
I only helped Blackbeard do what\nany father should have done.

1270
02:02:38,870 --> 02:02:42,070
你既残忍又无知
You are cruel and ignorant.

1271
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:49,580
一把手枪 一颗子弹
One pistol, one shot.

1272
02:02:49,710 --> 02:02:51,940
在我饿死前自杀?
To kill myself before I starve?

1273
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:53,640
亲爱的 我不相信你
There's no trusting you, love.

1274
02:02:53,790 --> 02:02:56,250
再说了 这是繁忙的贸易路线
Besides, this is a\nwell-traveled trade route.

1275
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:57,980
你可以给过往船只打信号
You can signal a passing ship.

1276
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:01,580
或是饮弹自尽 随你便
Or you can just bite the\nproverbial bullet, as it were.

1277
02:03:01,730 --> 02:03:03,320
那我又要怎么挣脱这些绳索?
And how will I get free\nof these bonds?

1278
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:06,230
你半个小时之前就挣脱了绳索
You broke free of your bonds\nhalf an hour ago,

1279
02:03:06,330 --> 02:03:09,160
只是在等着突袭的最佳时刻
waiting for the precise moment\nto pounce.

1280
02:03:11,870 --> 02:03:13,560
杰克 承认吧
Admit it, Jack.

1281
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:17,610
- 你还爱我\n- 如果你有个姐妹和一条狗
- You still love me.\n- If you had a sister and a dog,

1282
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:20,040
我会选择那条狗
I'd choose the dog.

1283
02:03:20,210 --> 02:03:23,580
宝藏!有个装满珠宝的箱子!
Treasure!\nThere is a chest with jewels!

1284
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:25,950
拥有控制风和潮汐的力量的珠宝!
Jewels with the power\nto rule the wind and tide!

1285
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:29,180
- 你在胡编乱造!\n- 等等...
- You're making that up!\n- Wait...

1286
02:03:29,990 --> 02:03:33,690
我怀孕了 你的
I am with child. Yours.

1287
02:03:34,930 --> 02:03:36,330
我不记得我们曾经...
I don't recall that we ever had...

1288
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:39,190
- 你当时醉了!\n- 我从没有那么醉过
- You were drunk!\n- I've actually never been that drunk.

1289
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:40,460
等等!
Wait!

1290
02:03:42,330 --> 02:03:44,390
我有话想对你说
There is something I want to say to you.

1291
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:48,730
从我们一见面起我就想说
Something I wanted to say\nfrom the moment we first met.

1292
02:03:49,670 --> 02:03:50,800
说吧
Go on, then.

1293
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:54,480
我爱你
I love you.

1294
02:03:58,050 --> 02:03:59,880
我也是
As do I.

1295
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:03,480
一直是 永远也会是
Always have. Always will.

1296
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:09,480
我得走了
I gotta go.

1297
02:04:09,630 --> 02:04:10,650
杰克!
Jack!

1298
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:14,560
还没完呢!
This is not over!

1299
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:16,690
杰克!
Jack!

1300
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:27,770
打偏了!
Missed!

1301
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:46,090
复仇成功
The Revenge is mine.

1302
02:04:52,770 --> 02:04:54,240
先生...
Sir...

1303
02:04:56,710 --> 02:04:58,570
我们在甲板下找到了这个
We found this below decks.

1304
02:05:24,670 --> 02:05:26,930
所有人!顺风而上!
All hands!\nPly to windward!

1305
02:05:27,070 --> 02:05:30,630
动作快点 你们这些人渣!
Get cracking,\nye blooming cockroaches!

1306
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:35,940
王室对我不薄
The Crown served me well.

1307
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:39,070
但现在 以海神和天空之神之名...
But now, by the gods of sea and sky...

1308
02:05:39,220 --> 02:05:43,310
...朝托尔图加出发!
...make way for Tortuga!

1309
02:05:54,430 --> 02:05:57,600
吉布斯 你个混蛋 痴迷的老水手\n你来了!
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback,\nyou made it!

1310
02:05:57,740 --> 02:05:59,290
是!
Aye!

1311
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:01,030
我相信我们联手
And I trust we managed a profit

1312
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:05,340
- 得到了点好处?\n- 好好看清楚
- from our joint enterprise?\n- Feast your eyes.

1313
02:06:10,410 --> 02:06:12,940
指南针直指向目标
The compass led me straight and true.

1314
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:15,080
黑胡子那些看船的家伙们呢?
What of Blackbeard's men\nguarding the ship?

1315
02:06:15,190 --> 02:06:19,090
我用了跟新几内亚那次一样的招数
I employed the selfsame maneuver\nwe perfected in New Guinea.

1316
02:06:19,190 --> 02:06:23,290
扔下整艘船其实挺可惜的
Seemed a shame to leave\nan entire fleet behind.

1317
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:25,490
是挺可惜的
Shame indeed.

1318
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:38,810
我恨那只猴子
I hate that monkey.

1319
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:42,380
所以 黑珍珠号...\n我们应该怎样把她弄出来呢?
So, the Pearl...\nAny idea how to get her out?

1320
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:45,540
我们需要一把十字弓\n一个沙漏 三只羊
We shall need a crossbow,\nan hourglass, three goats.

1321
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:48,710
我们中得有人学会吹小号\n同时另一个人这样子...
One of us must learn to play the trumpet\nwhilst the other one goes like this...

1322
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:52,520
- 我认识一个有羊的人\n- 很好 我可以这样子
- I know a man with a goat.\n- Good. I can go like this.

1323
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:56,820
杰克 我想问...
Jack, I have to ask...

1324
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:59,830
你当时有圣杯 泉水和眼泪...
You had the chalices,\nthe water, the tear...

1325
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:02,490
也许你能永远不老
You could have lived maybe forever.

1326
02:07:02,630 --> 02:07:04,600
吉布斯 不老泉确实会测试你
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.

1327
02:07:04,770 --> 02:07:07,670
但最好还是不要知道自己的\n最后一刻是什么时候
But better to not know\nwhich moment may be your last.

1328
02:07:07,810 --> 02:07:09,830
生命的每一刻
Every morsel of your entire being

1329
