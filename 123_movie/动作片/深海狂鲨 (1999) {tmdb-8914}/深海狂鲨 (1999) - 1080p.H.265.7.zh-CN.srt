1
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,171
美极了
So beautiful.

2
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:27,843
那是什么？
What's that?

3
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:31,928
过来 你有没有感觉到什么？ 当然有
-Did you feel something? -Yeah, I feel something.

4
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:36,892
回来
Hey, get back here!

5
00:01:39,936 --> 00:01:41,605
音乐开大声点
Turn up the music!

6
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:47,611
我们在开派对呢
We're having a party, man.

7
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:51,323
你们玩得可开心了 整条船都被你们搞得摇摇晃晃
You guys are having fun. Boat's rocking.

8
00:01:57,704 --> 00:01:58,830
别吵
Stop!

9
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,999
你太紧张了 听
-You're paranoid! -Listen.

10
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:03,251



11
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,008
你们有没有听到？
Did you hear that?

12
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:12,802
快听
Listen, listen.

13
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:26,525
你们听到了没？ 那是什么？
-You hear that? -What is that?

14
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:36,117
小声点
Everybody, shh!

15
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:39,913
待在上面
Stay up there.

16
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:52,342
那到底是什么？
What is that?

17
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:11,653
快点


18
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:20,662
快
Come on!

19
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:18,960
“实验室鲨鱼凶性大发”


20
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:23,934
没错 实验室的确是出了点问题
Okay, we've had some problems at the facility.

21
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,854
但我们所做的实验前无古人
What we're attempting to achieve has never been done.

22
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:31,733
我们再差一点 就能够重新活化人脑细胞
We're this close to the reactivation of a human brain cell.

23
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:37,614
我在本公司投资的两亿元 多数用来资助你的研究
Doctor... ...the $200 million I sunk into this company is due in great part to your research.

24
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:39,658
但等下周一开市…
But when the market opens Monday...

25
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:42,619
虽然我一向胆大 但也不愿冒这种风险
...despite my reputation, I don't like heights.

26
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,955
特别是有可能亏损的时候
Especially falling from them.

27
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:47,624
我真的很抱歉
I'm sorry, honestly.

28
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:03,348
告诉我，法兰克林先生 你有熟人罹患阿兹海默病吗？
Tell me, Mr. Franklin, have you ever known anyone with Alzheimer's?

29
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,977
没有
Well, no.

30
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:12,691
我父亲临终前的一段日子 唯一记挂的就是 我母亲为什么不在家？
By the end, all my father could do was ask why my mother wasn't at home.

31
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:17,571
每次我告诉他说她死了 就必须看他 再一次遭逢丧妻之痛
Each time I said she was dead, I saw him take the loss like a car wreck.

32
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:20,991
每年都有20万名男女 罹患阿兹海默症
200,000 men and women develop Alzheimer's each year.

33
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:25,996
如果吃一颗药就能解决 这些人的痛苦该有多好
What if you could end all that suffering with a single pill?

34
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:31,626
让我工作到周一早上 48小时就好
Give me till Monday morning. 48 hours.

35
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:33,714
我的研究成果 能让你的股价一飞冲天
I'll give you results that'll skyrocket your stock price...

36
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:36,506
否则我就亲自帮你打包
...or I'll help you pack the lab myself.

37
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:38,633
我让你决定
It's your call.

38
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:56,818
你刚刚那篇演讲颇精彩
That was an impressive speech you gave back there.

39
00:05:58,382 --> 00:06:00,989
我读过有关你的报导
I read that article on you.

40
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:04,109
你在喜马拉雅山 遇到雪崩的报导 是阿尔卑斯山
-The thing in the Himalayas. -Alps.

41
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:05,869
没错
Right.

42
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:11,416
我们夫妻 只是想一起做点什么事
We werejust trying to do something together.

43
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,251
出去散散心
Having fun.

44
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:15,837
没想到却遇上雪崩
Things went bad.

45
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:18,965
但你救了很多人
But you saved all those people.

46
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:20,342
不过还是有人死了
Not all.

47
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:38,944
那是海军在二次世界大战建的 
Navy built it for WWII submarine loading...

48
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:40,612
好让潜水艇补充燃油及补给品
...refueling.

49
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:46,201
当海军弃置的时候 我们接手了 增建了水中围栏，海底实验室
When they mothballed it, we picked it up, added aquatic pens, underwater labs.

50
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:49,120
那些钱应该都是你出的
Your dime, I guess.

51
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,000
看起来像是 在水上飘浮的恶魔岛
Looks like Alcatraz floats.

52
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:24,958
（西班牙文）


53
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,245
你觉得如何，老兄？ 它足足有12尺长 真是美极了
What do you think? She's a 12-footer. She's beautiful.

54
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:31,467
它想好好吻你一下
-She wants to give you a big kiss. -I bet.

55
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:35,083
是啊，它嘴里还塞了一块车牌
She's got a license plate jammed in her mouth.

56
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,710
它价廉物美
It's a good deal, amigo.

57
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:39,254
把它放下去，比利
Drop her, Billy!

58
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:55,645
这位是罗素法兰克林 这是詹妮丝席根斯
Russell Franklin, Janice Higgins.

59
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:57,564
她是海洋生物学家
Marine biologist.

60
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,733
詹妮丝会帮你安顿下来
Jan will get you settled.

61
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,778
欢迎光临我们的岛屿乐园
Welcome to our island paradise.

62
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:05,447
塔图呢？
Where's Tattoo?

63
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:07,574
就是那个小矮子？
You know, short guy?

64
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:10,702
“飞机，老板，飞机”
''The plane, Boss! The plane!''

65
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:12,662
是啊
Right.

66
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:15,707
我老了
I am getting old.

67
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,752
你对我们的实验室了解多少？
How much do you know about our facility?

68
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:19,275
就把我当成寻常观光客好了
Treat me like a tourist.

69
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:23,507
不，我讨厌观光客 但我喜欢你
I hate tourists and I've decided I'm going to like you.

70
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:43,295
路易斯安那的车牌
''Louisiana.''

71
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:47,507
我猜它是从巴顿鲁治的 宠物店买来的
I think he was bought in a pet shop in Baton Rouge.

72
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:50,844
它不仅吃光了 水族箱里所有的生物 连买它的人也不放过
Ate everything in his tank, and then ate the guy that bought him.

73
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:56,141
第二天开着装满水的车 到下加利福尼亚来了
Next day, fills up the cab of the guy's truck with water and drives to Baja...

74
00:09:56,516 --> 00:09:59,686
用这块车牌剔牙
...picking bones out of his teeth with the license plate.

75
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:03,106
我们得好好谈谈
We need to talk.

76
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,734
待会儿吧
Later.

77
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:12,199
这位是罗素法兰克林 他是卡美拉药厂的董事长
Carter Blake, Russell Franklin, president of Chimera Pharmaceuticals.

78
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:16,453
你刚刚实在太棒了
That was incredible.

79
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:20,123
老实说，鲨鱼并不太爱吃人
Actually, they don't like the taste of us very much.

80
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:27,422
它们咬人是因为 把我们误以为是头肥海豹
If they bite you, it's because they think you're a fat little seal.

81
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:30,842
或是有钱的生意人
Or a rich suit.

82
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:37,891
幸会
Nice meeting you.

83
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:42,896
真友善啊
Friendly place.

84
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:46,525
他至少还跟你说话 一般他跟人点个头就算了
You got full sentences. Usually, he just kind of nods.

85
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:51,404
你到这里来的原因 很快就传开了
Word travels fast about why you're here and all.

86
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:54,699
那就是逃脱的 那一只一代鲨吗？
Was that the Gen 1 that escaped?

87
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:58,537
那个小砘铮坎豢赡 那些都是体型正常的鲨鱼
That little guy? No way. Those are the normals.

88
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:00,664
这三只才是实验鲨
These three are the test sharks.

89
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:08,004
有两只一代鲨和一只二代母鲨
Two first-generation and one second-generation female.

90
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:16,763
在这片平静的海面下 
Beneath its glassy surface...

91
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:19,641
是一个充满怪兽的世界
...a world of gliding monsters.

92
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,189
很吓人吧
It's pretty scary stuff, huh?

93
00:11:27,357 --> 00:11:29,484
没错
Yes. It is.

94
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:33,530
塔台呼叫水上海轮…
Tower to water taxi.

95
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:37,826
班，我发现30英哩外 有一阵难缠的飓风
Ben, I'm picking up a nasty little bitch of a squall about 30 miles out.

96
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:38,910
完毕
Over.

97
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,912
收到，我们不会有事的
Copy that. We'll be all right.

98
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:50,714
詹妮丝，别淋到雨了
Jan, stay out of the rain.

99
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:53,425
他们去哪儿？ 他们也讨厌我吗？
Where are they going? They hate me too?

100
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:56,803
他们要回家，我们周末时 留守的工作人员很少
They're going home. We run a skeleton crew on the weekend.

101
00:11:57,491 --> 00:12:00,390
不过他们搞不好也讨厌你
But they probably hate you anyway.

102
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:05,499
那位是詹姆斯惠特洛博士 他是个大天才
There's Dr. Jim Whitlock, the most brilliant man ever.

103
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,608
逆风尿尿的人算哪门子天才？
He's pissing into the wind. How brilliant can he be?

104
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:11,151
走着瞧吧
You'll see.

105
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:27,334
怎么了，神枪手 第一枪失手了？
What happened, deadeye? You miss with the first shot?

106
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:29,377
我连发两枪 才让它减慢速度而已
It took two hits to even slow it down.

107
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:32,422
你爱说笑 给它打两针 它就应该奄奄一息了
Are you kidding? Two of these should've almost killed it.

108
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:33,924
这话说给它听吧，史考
Go tell it that, Scoggs.

109
00:12:33,924 --> 00:12:37,252
是你失手了，别因此迁怒于我
You missed. Don't get mad at me because you can't shoot worth a shit.

110
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:41,097
如果你昨晚记得把栅门关好 我就可以好好睡一觉了
If you hadn't left the pen open, I could've had a good sleep.

111
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:44,226
我已经跟博士说过了 我昨晚的确把栅门锁好了
I already told the doc, I locked the pen like I do every night.

112
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:46,353
鲨鱼一定是从 别的地方溜出去的
The fish got out some other way.

113
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:50,190
干嘛那样看我？
What are you looking at me like that for?

114
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,067
你还能信任谁？
Who are you going to trust?

115
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:54,986
就是我，你能信任我
Me, that's who. You trust me.

116
00:12:54,986 --> 00:12:58,198
知道为什么吗？ 因为我值得信任
You know why? Because I'm trustworthy.

117
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:06,373
这些篱笆有多高？
How high are these fences off the water?

118
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:10,202
在换算水位变换及张力…
Given the surface variations and tensile strength--

119
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:13,839
长话短说
Short answer, man.

120
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:17,300
八英尺，加减一公分
Eight feet, give or take a centimeter.

121
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:27,602
对不起，我把海洋实验室 说得像精神病院一样
I'm sorry. I'm making Aquatica sound like a mental hospital.

122
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:29,229
不会啦
No, not really.

123
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:31,189
也许有一点
Well, maybe a little.

124
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:33,859
事实上，它就是精神病院
The truth is, it is.

125
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:37,737
但这里的全是顶尖好手
But almost everyone here is top of their game.

126
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:42,492
住在水底就像在外太空一样 不容许丝毫差错
Living below is like living in space. You don't get very many mistakes.

127
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:48,874
除了半哩长的走道之外 我们利用你提供的资金 买了钛合金围篱 层层围住礁湖及鲨鱼栏
Besides the catwalks... ...you bought us titanium-based fencing around all the lagoon and pens.

128
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:52,127
水底一共有三层 水底第一层是工作人员宿舍
There are three sub-levels. Sub-level One is living quarters.

129
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:54,337
第二层是水中实验室及工作室
Two: Wet lab and workshops.

130
00:13:54,337 --> 00:13:57,632
第三层是工程部 及高压水底出入口
And Three: Engineering and air-locked wet entry.

131
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:05,807
欢迎光临海洋实验室
Welcome to Aquatica.

132
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:43,428
二代鲨注射血清了吗？
Did you dose the Gen 2 with the serum?

133
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:47,891
你一来电我就交待卡特去办了 明天晚上应该可以准备好
I had Carter do it as soon as you called. It should be ready tomorrow night.

134
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:50,519
但是？ 我们却还无法准备好
-But? -We will not be ready.

135
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,438
我们已经超前进度两个月了
Two months ahead of schedule.

136
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:56,483
我们已经跳过 三回合的初步试验
We're skipping three rounds of preliminary trials.

137
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:58,235
我别无选择
No choice.

138
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:05,325
你一辈子都在等那重要的一刻
You wait your whole life for a single moment...

139
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:09,246
突然间，那一刻就是明天
...and then one day, it's tomorrow.

140
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:21,383
驯鲨人到底是做什么的？
So what exactly does a shark wrangler do?

141
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:24,970
应该就是名符其实吧
Pretty much what it sounds like, I guess.

142
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,556
你是怎么会到 海洋实验室来工作的？
How'd you end up here at Aquatica?

143
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:29,182
我喜欢水
I like the water.

144
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:30,809
薪水也不错
Pay is good.

145
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:39,703
潜水面罩？ 我在西班牙外海潜水 沉船探险时有戴过
An AGA mask! Did some wreck diving in one of these, off the coast of Spain.

146
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:43,154
就是那种观光活动 你知道吧？
Tourist thing.

147
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:46,700
你喜欢沉船探险？
Do you like wreck diving?

148
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:50,954
还不错
It's okay.

149
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:53,540
我想你一定很行吧
I bet you're really good at it.

150
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:59,546
我们现在在海上 你欲擒故纵那套不管用
We're on the water. Whole cat-and-mouse thing don't float.

151
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,259
你是这里的老大，对吧？
You're the man, right?

152
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,346
没错
Yeah, I'm the man.

153
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:12,517
老大手上一定有人事资料 我那份上写什么？
The man's always got a file. What's it say?

154
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:15,854
你因为走私 在里文渥斯坐了两年牢
Two years, Leavenworth. Smuggling.

155
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:20,108
那你的钱是怎么来的，老兄？
How'd you make your money?

156
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:23,069
难不成你是史上第一个 清清白白的有钱人？
You the first rich guy in history who's squeaky-clean?

157
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,740
你应该很了解我的疑虑
You do understand my concern, right?

158
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:30,368
我有个提议
Look, I got a workable deal here.

159
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:34,873
我不兴风作浪 遵守我的假释条件
I don't make waves. I meet the terms of my parole.

160
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:38,293
我不像博士一样想改变世界
I'm not out to change the world, like the doc.

161
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,379
我也不打算破坏这个世界
I'm not out to wreck it either.

162
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:54,017
有种咬我啊，混蛋
Eat me, asshole!

163
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,897
你这个蠢猪
Hey, you dickhead!

164
00:17:04,986 --> 00:17:06,404
肥屁股
Fat butt!

165
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:08,281
你的屁股肥死了
You got a big, fat butt.

166
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,828
你快把我烦死了 别逼我淹死你
You know what, bird? You're trying my last nerve. Don't make me drown your feathery ass.

167
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:15,247
或是买一只猫
Get myself a cat.

168
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:18,750
真乖
That's good. Yes. That's good.

169
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:22,587

That's it.

170
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:26,132
你的舌头真难看，你知道吗？
You got a nasty-looking tongue, you know that?

171
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,598
喂食时间到罗
Feeding time.

172
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,694
30秒后就放鲨鱼 听到了吗？
I'm releasing the tiger shark in 30 seconds. Copy?

173
00:17:45,694 --> 00:17:47,863
我听到了，我现在就进去
I hear you. I'm going in.

174
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,825
你们饿了吗？
You guys hungry?

175
00:18:31,198 --> 00:18:36,328
麦博士，我们这里出状况了 请马上到水面层来
Dr. McAlester, we have a situation up here. Could you please come to surface level?

176
00:18:37,204 --> 00:18:41,583
麦博士，麻烦请到水面层来
Dr. McAlester, could you come to surface level, please?

177
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,709
惊喜！
Surprise!

178
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:27,087
生日快乐
Happy birthday!

179
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,052
我恨死那首歌了
Damn, I hate that song.

180
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:37,472
喜欢这首歌吗，神父？
You like the tunes there, Preach?

181
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:45,981
卡特，快来加入我们 这里女人太多 史考已经分身乏术了
Carter, join us. There's too much woman on this deck for Scoggs to handle.

182
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:47,983
请给我一杯伏特加
Vodka, straight.

183
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,779
对了，今晚的食物真好吃
And by the way, food was excellent, brother.

184
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:57,567
你就是那个被雪崩困住的人？
You're that guy that got caught in that avalanche, right?

185
00:19:57,617 --> 00:20:00,078
没错，就是我
I'm the one.

186
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:05,917
黑人的死法难道还不够多？ 你还要去荒郊野岭送命
Black men have enough ways to get killed... ...without climbing up some mountain in the middle of nowhere.

187
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:09,212
那里留给白人去吧，黑哥
You need to leave that to the white folks, ''brother.''

188
00:20:16,094 --> 00:20:17,721
生日过得快乐吗？
Happy birthday?

189
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:20,974
我明天早上再告诉你
I'll let you know tomorrow.

190
00:20:22,642 --> 00:20:24,519
水底生活如何？
How's life underwater?

191
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:27,856
比水上的生活
It's a lot less complicated...

192
00:20:28,398 --> 00:20:30,400
单纯多了
...than it is on the surface.

193
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:32,569
这点我可以确定
That's for sure.

194
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,198
你今天处理那只 新来的虎斑鲨手法很不错
Nice work with that new tiger shark today.

195
00:20:36,198 --> 00:20:38,950
改天告诉我 你是在哪儿学会的
One day, you'll have to tell me how you learned that.

196
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,204
改天请我喝杯啤酒 说不定我会告诉你
One day, you'll take me up on that beer and maybe I will.

197
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:45,957
我没时间玩乐
It's all work for me, Carter.

198
00:20:46,374 --> 00:20:48,793
不过也许改天有机会
But, like you said, ''One day.''

199
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:54,299
鲨鱼年老时不会罹患癌症 失明，或损失脑部功能
Sharks never get cancer, go blind or show loss of brain activity as they age.

200
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,801
不像我认识的某些人那样
Unlike some people I know.

201
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,889
鲨鱼是地球最古老的生物之一
Sharks are the oldest creatures on the planet...

202
00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:05,936
当时地球还是个 弱肉强食的野蛮世界
...from a time when the world was just flesh and teeth.

203
00:21:07,062 --> 00:21:12,776
我们利用贺尔蒙 将这只母鲨的前脑增大五倍
By using a hormonal enhancer... ...we increased this female's forebrain to five times its normal size.

204
00:21:12,776 --> 00:21:14,528
以取得更多蛋白质
To harvest more protein.

205
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:17,072
完全正确 那些蛋白质也许可以活化…
Exactly. A protein that may reactivate--

206
00:21:17,072 --> 00:21:18,198
一定可以的…
That will....

207
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:23,662
能活化人脑细胞的蛋白质 就储存在鲨鱼的前脑中
...that will reactivate human brain cells stored in the forebrain of the shark.

208
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:25,290
在不使用基因工程下
I'm just amazed that

209
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,176
我们能够在短时间内 有如此长足进步
we've come so far, so fast,

210
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:28,510
令我十分意外
without genetic tampering.

211
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:33,672
使用基因工程增加脑能量 是违反 哈佛基因工程协定的行为
Genetic engineering to increase brain mass violates the Harvard Genetics Compact.

212
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:36,424
更别提违反卡美洛的政策
Not to mention Chimera policy.

213
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:40,136
它们成群出猎
They're hunting in packs.

214
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:42,931
像野狗一样 
Like wild dogs.

215
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,560
它们只吃其它的鲨鱼
They'll only eat other sharks.

216
00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:49,437
你太多虑了
You're reading too much into it.

217
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:53,233
那条一代鲨 攻击一艘25公尺的船
That Gen 1 attacked a 25-foot boat.

218
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:58,321
这也是我多虑了吗？
Am I reading too much into that too?

219
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:01,491
你告诉法兰克林了没？
Did you tell Franklin?

220
00:22:03,201 --> 00:22:05,453
我只是个养鱼的，小姐
I'm just a fish keeper, lady.

221
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:09,374
但提早用那条鲨鱼进行实验 不是个好主意
But bringing in that shark ahead of schedule was a very bad idea.

222
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:14,379
你喜欢你的工作吗？
Do you like your job?

223
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,260
你在威胁我吗，博士？
Are you threatening me, Doc?

224
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:22,179
不是
No.

225
00:22:23,513 --> 00:22:28,039
但是如果明天的实验 不成功的话 我们全都得卷铺盖
But if we don't pull off that test tomorrow, we're all on the street.

226
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:32,439
你是个好人，卡特
You're a good man, Carter.

227
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:35,807
但有你这样的背景…
But with your background....

228
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,627
是啊
Right.

229
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,346
我们的大姐头还好吗？
How's Miss Smarty-Pants?

230
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:07,766
她比外表聪明多了
Hope she's not as dumb as she seems.

231
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:10,477
你有照我的要求架高篱笆吗？
Raise those fences like I asked?

232
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:14,064
我都搞定了，去喝杯啤酒吧
I took care of it. Let's go get a beer.

233
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:25,534
美国海岸防卫队 提出以下忠告：
US Coast Guard advisories include:

234
00:23:25,534 --> 00:23:30,497
所有位于美国本土以南 以及加州以西的船只请注意
All-craft warnings for waters south of the US mainland and west of CA.

235
00:23:30,497 --> 00:23:33,542
热带低气压狭带强风豪雨 并掀起30英尺高的大浪…
A tropical depression is generating gale-force winds...

236
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:39,860
重覆一次，美国海岸防卫队…
...and is associated with heavy rains and ocean swells to 30 feet or more.

237
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:50,308
你嘴巴不放干净点 我就把你煮了吃
Any of your nonsense, and we'll have tiny drumsticks on the menu tonight.

238
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:51,768
肥屁股
Fat butt!

239
00:23:53,228 --> 00:23:54,062
没错
That's right.

240
00:23:54,062 --> 00:23:56,189
你爱怎样摇头摆脑随你
You can...all you want.

241
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:48,700
欢迎进入我的天地 法兰克林先生
Welcome to my parlor, Mr. Franklin.

242
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:56,458

Wow.

243
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:03,173
实验室注意，上面风雨很大 能见度极差
Wet lab, we're taking a pounding up here. Can't see past my nose.

244
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:06,343
我建议你们赶快检查 鲨鱼栏和礁湖的监视器
So I suggest you check pen monitors and lagoon monitors.

245
00:25:06,343 --> 00:25:08,637
我想你们下面的能见度 应该也很差
I can't imagine there's much visibility below.

246
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:10,347
卡特，收到了吗？
Carter, you copy?

247
00:25:12,922 --> 00:25:13,892
卡特…


248
00:25:14,184 --> 00:25:16,853
我已经快要到隧道了
Okay, I'm approaching the tunnel.

249
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:19,689
好极了，任务圆满达成
Bingo. Elvis has left the building.

250
00:25:19,689 --> 00:25:22,609
我们看到你了 不过能见度非常差
We picked you up, but visibility's near zero.

251
00:25:22,943 --> 00:25:24,611
没问题
No problem.

252
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:11,157
它们这种集体行动的行为 进行多久了？
How long have they been synchronized like this?

253
00:26:17,747 --> 00:26:19,791
那不是真的吧？
Tell me I didn't see that.

254
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,213
它们居然认出那把枪
They recognized that gun!

255
00:26:25,213 --> 00:26:28,550
那是不可能的 鲨鱼根本不会倒着游
That's impossible. Sharks can't swim backwards!

256
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,802
大家专心一点 那是怎么回事啊？
-Try to stay focused. -What was that?

257
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:39,019
二代鲨栏的画面中断了
We lost picture in Gen 2 pen.

258
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:40,729
等等
Okay, hold on.

259
00:27:18,892 --> 00:27:21,436
卡特，听到了吗？
Carter, do you copy?

260
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:26,358
卡特，听到了吗？
Carter, do you copy?

261
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,828
卡特，听到请回答
Carter, talk to me, man. Do you copy?

262
00:27:43,615 --> 00:27:46,670
别闹了，你把大家吓得半死
Cut the crap! You're scaring everybody.

263
00:27:49,297 --> 00:27:50,882
卡特…


264
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:15,271
准备启动升降平台 他打中它了
Boarding platform engaged. He's got her.

265
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:32,841
有人点鱼吃吗？
Did someone order the fish?

266
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:02,913
上帝呀 怎么会有这么大的鲨鱼？
What in God's creation?

267
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:06,208
这不是上帝的杰作
No, not His.

268
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:09,419
这是我们的杰作
Ours.

269
00:29:21,723 --> 00:29:23,225
开始扫瞄
Commencing scan.

270

很好


279
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:38,008
也许是做恶梦吧
Bad dream?

280
00:30:58,111 --> 00:30:59,362
就定位
In position.

281
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:01,573
生命迹象稳定

297
00:33:31,681 --> 00:33:33,099
恭喜

299
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:41,775
6.560秒耶
6.560 seconds.

300
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:48,156
请问要多久才会有 持久性的成果？
Now that you've got this... ...how long before you make something permanent?

301
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:49,699
我们成功了，伙伴
You did it, pal.

302
00:33:50,992 --> 00:33:52,327
你成功了
You did it.

303
00:34:00,544 --> 00:34:01,670

你疯了？
Are you insane?

306
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:52,804
塔台，立即派医护人员前来 并开始蔬散
Tower, we need paramedics and evac now!

307
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:55,056
这是求救讯号…

Got it.

315
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:26,671
他在出血
He's hemorrhaging!

316
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:30,175
他们说那里的黄色蝴蝶 多得不得了，记得吗？
They say the yellow butterflies are thick as clouds there, remember?

317
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:36,097
海洋实验室研究中心 这里是XA2-18
Research Station Aquatica, this is X-ray Alpha 2-18.

我不是人医 你继续做就是了
-I'm not this kind of doctor. -Just keep doing what you're doing.

323
00:36:05,418 --> 00:36:07,712
塔台，直升机呢？
Where's the chopper? Tower?

324
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:10,423
布兰达，我的直升机呢？
Come on, Brenda. Where's my chopper?

325
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:24,104
法兰克林，推这边

我抓到了，把他推出来
Got it. Okay, move him out.

329
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:54,467
快点…

330
00:37:01,912 --> 00:37:04,749
一，二，三


331
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:09,482
我爱你
I love you!

332
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,253

333
00:37:41,014 --> 00:37:42,474
快点，卡特…
Come on, Carter!

334
00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:29,312
快拉，快点把他拉上去
Pull up, 2-18! Pull up!

335
00:38:47,873 --> 00:38:49,791
该死的，什么都看不到
Damn! I can't get a picture.

336
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:52,294
塔台，你那边有画面吗？
Tower, have you got a visual? Copy.

337
00:38:52,294 --> 00:38:53,753
我什么都看不到
I can't get anything.

338
00:38:58,508 --> 00:39:00,093
塔台，听到了吗？
-Do you copy? -Going to back-up.

339
00:39:00,093 --> 00:39:01,261
有画面了
Got it!

340
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:11,831
这是上帝的旨意
I'm going to take this as a sign.

341
00:40:23,802 --> 00:40:25,554
惠特勒呢？
Where is he now?

342
00:40:25,554 --> 00:40:27,138
他在哪里？
Where is he?

343
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,945
监视系统全都中断了 布兰达？
-The whole system's shut down. -Brenda?

344
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:33,979
你收得到吗？
Are you there?

345
00:40:33,979 --> 00:40:35,564
监视系统坏了
This thing is dead.

346
00:40:37,274 --> 00:40:38,900
拜托你们
Somebody, please...

347
00:40:39,776 --> 00:40:41,570
告诉我那是什么？
...tell me what that is.

348
00:40:41,945 --> 00:40:43,196
拜托你们告诉我
Please.

349
00:41:27,616 --> 00:41:29,993
我们快走
All right, people, let's move.

350
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:32,078
现在就走
Now!

351
00:41:33,163 --> 00:41:34,706
快到门边
Get to the door!

352
00:41:35,332 --> 00:41:37,459
快走
Come on. You can't help him.

353
00:41:40,253 --> 00:41:42,088
快走…


354
00:41:45,988 --> 00:41:47,114
快走


355
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,102
门打不开


356
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:25,257
快点，史考
-The door frame is bent. -Open.

357
00:42:30,846 --> 00:42:32,013
快开门
Open it!

358
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:36,372
快走…


359
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,541
快走


360
00:42:54,578 --> 00:42:56,371
关上门，关上
Turn it! Turn it!

361
00:42:56,913 --> 00:42:58,206
不…
No!

362
00:43:05,088 --> 00:43:07,319
布兰达…


363
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:09,342
塔台，听得到吗？
Tower, can you hear me?

364
00:43:11,261 --> 00:43:12,888
有人在吗？
Anyone, hello?

365
00:43:25,442 --> 00:43:28,111
我们一定要到顶层去求援
We got to get topside, find some help.

366
00:43:28,111 --> 00:43:29,196
你干嘛？
What?

367
00:43:29,196 --> 00:43:30,572
开始进水了
We're flooded.

368
00:43:31,406 --> 00:43:32,490
该死的
Shit!

369
00:43:35,076 --> 00:43:37,412
这是这层唯一的楼梯
There's no other stairway from this level.

370
00:43:37,913 --> 00:43:38,997
有没有电梯？
Elevator?

371
00:43:38,997 --> 00:43:42,501
一进水电梯会自动封闭
It seals off automatically to keep the shaft from filling.

372
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,711
我们上不去了
There's no way up.

373
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:17,160
好…
All right. Okay.

374
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:22,082
如果这是因为我酒喝多了 那我不喝就是了
If this is a lesson about the drinking, let's just say I've learned it.

375
00:44:22,332 --> 00:44:24,044
不需要发这么大的火
No need to get carried away, showing me your vengeful side.

376
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:27,587
上帝，我知道你生气 是什么德性
I know Your wrath, Lord.

377
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:29,923
好，B走廊是干的
If Corridor B is dry...

378
00:44:29,923 --> 00:44:34,302
我们必须回到第三层
...we go back to the maintenance ladder, climb down to Level 3.

379
00:44:34,594 --> 00:44:36,096
我们到潜水出口处
We get to the wet entry.

380
00:44:36,096 --> 00:44:40,058
我们两个人一组 坐潜水艇到上层去
We take the sub topside, two at a time. We go down to get up.

381
00:44:42,352 --> 00:44:44,521
好，跟我来
All right, let's move. Come on.

382
00:45:38,846 --> 00:45:40,368
该死的


383
00:45:44,164 --> 00:45:45,665
好像有人还活着
Sounds like somebody made it.

384
00:45:45,665 --> 00:45:48,293
我们在这里
Over here! We're over here!

385
00:45:53,548 --> 00:45:54,966
神父？
Preach?

386
00:46:01,473 --> 00:46:02,766
那是什么鬼声音？
What the hell is that?

387
00:46:02,766 --> 00:46:04,768
也许是实验室仪器碰撞的声音
Lab equipment maybe, banging around.

388
00:46:04,768 --> 00:46:05,977
是吗？
Think so?

389
00:46:05,977 --> 00:46:07,479
不可能
Not a chance.

390
00:46:10,899 --> 00:46:12,526
我们一定要通过那一扇门
We got to get past that door.

391
00:46:13,276 --> 00:46:15,153
快跑…
Let's go!

392
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,581
快点
Come on!

393
00:46:26,894 --> 00:46:28,333
帮帮我


394
00:46:31,336 --> 00:46:35,248
快点…


395
00:46:35,298 --> 00:46:36,633
快开门
Open the door!

396
00:46:36,633 --> 00:46:37,801
快
Go! Go!

397
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,002
鸟儿
Bird!

398
00:47:14,087 --> 00:47:15,589
快过来，鸟儿
Come on, bird!

399
00:47:15,589 --> 00:47:17,632
你在哪里，鸟儿？
Where are you, bird?

400
00:47:23,555 --> 00:47:25,265
嘿，呆瓜
Hey, dickhead!

401
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,185
鸟儿？
Bird?

402
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,479
肥屁股
Fat butt!

403
00:47:31,479 --> 00:47:32,814
鸟儿？
Bird?

404
00:47:36,568 --> 00:47:40,655
鸟儿？有没有人在？
Anybody here?

405
00:47:43,408 --> 00:47:46,244
我问你一个问题 我们应该继续走才对
-Cowboy, let me ask you a question. -We should keep moving.

406
00:47:46,244 --> 00:47:47,996
我在跟他说话
I'm talking to him!

407
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:54,628
刚刚破门而入的是鲨鱼吗？
Was that a goddamn shark that broke through that door?

408
00:47:54,628 --> 00:47:55,670
应该是
I expect so.

409
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,380
应该？
You expect so?

410
00:47:58,715 --> 00:48:03,887
我是这里 唯一感觉事态异常的人吗？
Well, well, well. Am I the only asshole down here who thinks that a tad bit odd?

411
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:08,725
鲨鱼居然能够冲破钢门？
It can do that? Bust through a steel door?

412
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:11,520
我不是专家
I ain't the expert.

413
00:48:12,437 --> 00:48:14,295
但像二代鲨这样的体型
Given Gen 2's size and some room to move...

414
00:48:14,345 --> 00:48:19,152
只要空间足够 就可以产生数吨的撞击力
...she could put a couple tons, maybe more, into a hit.

415
00:48:20,153 --> 00:48:22,364
所以我认为这是可能的
So, yeah, in my opinion.

416
00:48:22,364 --> 00:48:25,242
如果它想进来 我们是挡不住的
If she wants through, she's coming.

417
00:48:25,492 --> 00:48:27,244
这些鲨鱼
And these sharks...

418
00:48:27,661 --> 00:48:31,331
破门而入 　不是为了找乐子吧？...
they aren't breaking down doors for the sheer joy of it, are they?

419
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:33,083
它们想致我们于死地
They're after us.

420
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:37,504
我们显然不知道 它们现在在干嘛？
It's obvious we don't know what they're doing.

421
00:48:42,425 --> 00:48:45,387
你到底对那些鲨鱼做了什么？
What the hell did you do to those sharks?

422
00:48:48,348 --> 00:48:53,228
它们的脑容量过小 我们无法抽取足够的蛋白质
Their brains weren't large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein.

423
00:48:54,187 --> 00:48:56,815
所以我们违反了哈佛协定…
So we violated the Harvard Compact.

424
00:48:59,776 --> 00:49:02,821
吉米和我利用基因工程 增加它们的脑容量
Jim and I used gene therapies to increase their brain mass.

425
00:49:02,821 --> 00:49:05,156
脑容量越大所含的蛋白质越多
Larger brain means more protein.

426
00:49:06,241 --> 00:49:09,119
但副作用是它们也变聪明了
As a side effect, the sharks got smarter.

427
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:14,875
你这个笨婊子
You stupid bitch!

428
00:49:22,883 --> 00:49:24,407
我也不希望发生这种事
I didn't want this to happen...

429
00:49:24,457 --> 00:49:30,891
但我们的研究 可以治疗脑部退行性疾病
...but with this research, we could wipe out degenerative brain disease.

430
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,519
想想看，我们能拯救多少人啊
Think of the generations that would be saved.

431
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:39,441
我们到底要怎么样说 你才听得进去？
How much dynamite do you have to set off in your ears before your head clears?

432
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:43,195
你不会懂的
You wouldn't understand.

433
00:49:43,904 --> 00:49:45,530
是吗？
I wouldn't?

434
00:49:46,615 --> 00:49:50,702
傻瓜卡特 想不通你在利用我们？
Dumb old Carter wouldn't understand that you used us?

435
00:49:53,163 --> 00:49:54,915
想不通你在利用我？
That you used me?

436
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:59,628
你找我是因为我不会惹事
Someone on the water who wouldn't make waves.

437
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,297
是因为我不会东问西问
Someone who wouldn't ask too many questions.

438
00:50:02,797 --> 00:50:04,466
因为我担心失去工作
Because he had something to lose.

439
00:50:04,466 --> 00:50:06,301
你不了解我们的成就
You don't see what we've done here.

440
00:50:06,301 --> 00:50:09,930
你让世上最古老的杀手 有了屠杀的欲望
You've taken God's oldest killing machine and given it will and desire.

441
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:13,850
你害我们一下子 掉到食物链的底端
You've knocked us to the bottom of the goddamn food chain.

442
00:50:14,643 --> 00:50:17,270
我认为这不叫进步
It's not a great leap forward, in my book.

443
00:50:20,065 --> 00:50:21,525
我们能救的人…
The people we'll save....

444
00:50:21,525 --> 00:50:23,693
吉米和布兰达吗？
Jim? Brenda?

445
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:26,738
我们呢？
Us?

446
00:50:28,949 --> 00:50:33,912
各位，这些鲨鱼聪明又冷酷
All right, people. These sharks are thinking hard and clear.

447
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,207
出个谜语让大家猜
So here's the riddle.

448
00:50:37,707 --> 00:50:39,876
你们猜一条八千磅聪明敏锐
What does an 8,000-pound mako shark...

449
00:50:39,876 --> 00:50:44,850
又没有天敌的虎斑鲨 在想什么？
...with a brain the size of a V8 engine and no natural predators, think about?

450
00:50:45,924 --> 00:50:48,677
我可不打算留在这里找出答案
I'm not waiting around here to find out.

451
00:50:49,261 --> 00:50:51,221
你现在明白了吧？
Now you see how that works?

452
00:50:51,221 --> 00:50:55,100
她恶整那些鲨鱼 现在它们回头来整我们
She screwed with the sharks and now the sharks are screwing with us.

453
00:51:14,286 --> 00:51:16,246
上帝啊，求求你保佑我脱身
Please let me get out of here.

454
00:52:22,229 --> 00:52:25,357
如果那些鲨鱼冲破篱笆 游进大海怎么办？
What if the sharks get through the fence and into the ocean?

455
00:52:25,357 --> 00:52:30,946
别担心，海中的围墙是钛合金 有弹性，所以作用像鱼网一样
It's okay. The fence on the ocean side is titanium. And it gives, so it works just like a net.

456
00:52:30,946 --> 00:52:34,533
我们到潜水艇那儿去吧 到顶层时再讨论
Let's get to the sub. We'll discuss it on the way to the top.

457
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,107
咬我啊，笨蛋
Eat me, asshole.

458
00:53:53,737 --> 00:53:55,030
小心点
Careful, now.

459
00:53:55,739 --> 00:53:57,824
来吧，鸟儿，快来
Come on, bird. Come on.

460
00:53:59,242 --> 00:54:01,411
过来吧，宝贝 呆子
Please, baby. Dickhead.

461
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:03,580
看到没，爸爸在笑
See Daddy smiling?

462
00:54:04,956 --> 00:54:05,957
来嘛
Come on.

463
00:54:05,957 --> 00:54:08,335
快点过来吧
Bring your feathery ass here. Come on.

464
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:45,455
那是爆炸造成的吗？ 不
-Explosion caused that? -No.

465
00:54:45,747 --> 00:54:50,544
爆炸的威力 绝对无法移动潜水艇的
Nothing in here could've blown with enough force to move that damn sub.

466
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:53,630
反正潜水艇已经毁了
Whatever. It's junk.

467
00:54:54,214 --> 00:54:58,468
我们可以一块儿潜水下去 看看谁有办法游到上层去
We could all just dive in and see who makes it to the top.

468
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:05,058
那不就是海洋实验室的精神吗 苏珊医生？
Isn't that the old Aquatica spirit, Dr. Susie?

469
00:55:05,642 --> 00:55:07,811
一头潜下去？
Just dive in.

470
00:55:10,522 --> 00:55:12,858
你先下去以身做则吧
You could go first, to lead by example.

471
00:55:12,858 --> 00:55:14,559
他是我最好的朋友，詹妮丝
He was my best friend, Janice.

472
00:55:14,609 --> 00:55:16,069
我才不下水
I'm not going in the water.

473
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:19,030
我死都不下水 听我说
-No way, man! The sharks are in there. -Listen!

474
00:55:19,322 --> 00:55:23,577
先穿上潜水衣防止体温过低 这至少是个开端
We put these on. They help fight hypothermia. That's a start.

475
00:55:23,577 --> 00:55:28,540
除非你们想出更高明的点子 否则我们只有游泳离开这里
And unless someone's got a better idea... ...we're going to have to swim out of here.

476
00:55:48,268 --> 00:55:50,770
不会吧
This isn't happening.

477
00:56:15,003 --> 00:56:17,589
我可不是面对狮子的但以理
I'm not Daniel when he faced the lion!

478
00:56:23,428 --> 00:56:25,931
上帝啊，你这个玩笑开得真大 
So I appreciate the irony, Lord!

479
00:56:26,348 --> 00:56:28,308
居然让厨师死在烤箱里
''Cook dies in his own oven!''

480
00:56:30,227 --> 00:56:33,365
但我更不打算乖乖认命
But I've got other plans!

481
00:57:11,226 --> 00:57:12,853
你吃了我的宝贝鸟
You ate my bird.

482
00:57:25,282 --> 00:57:26,491
爆炸是从顶层来的吗？
Was that the surface?

483
00:57:26,491 --> 00:57:29,411
不，震动是从内部传来的
No, the vibrations are too deep. That was from inside.

484
00:57:40,005 --> 00:57:43,758
如果我是你就不会靠那么近
I wouldn't get that close. Just a suggestion.

485
00:57:43,758 --> 00:57:46,386
水很混浊，我们也许能够成功
Water's murky. We might make it.

486
00:57:46,761 --> 00:57:49,139
不可能的
No way! No, we won't!

487
00:57:51,391 --> 00:57:53,393
从礁湖底部到水面
It's 230 feet...

488
00:57:53,727 --> 00:57:57,147
有230英尺深
...from the lagoon floor to the lagoon surface!

489
00:57:57,647 --> 00:58:00,483
人类游泳的速度是 每秒钟两英尺
The average human swims two feet per second.

490
00:58:00,483 --> 00:58:03,570
鲨鱼游泳的速度 平均是每秒钟50英尺
The average shark swims 50 feet per second.

491
00:58:03,904 --> 00:58:06,907
我死也不下水 
There's no way I'm getting into that pool!

492
00:58:07,324 --> 00:58:10,493
这里有一道维修专用的楼梯
What we have here is your basic maintenance ladder.

493
00:58:10,493 --> 00:58:12,579
可以一路通到顶端
This leads up to the surface.

494
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:15,248
史考，我爱死你了
I love you, Scoggs. I really do!

495
00:58:15,957 --> 00:58:17,459
我怎么觉得 你还有坏消息要告诉我
Why do I feel a ''but'' coming on?

496
00:58:19,044 --> 00:58:22,005
但我们现在完全不明了 顶端的情况
But we don't know what shape the surface level is in.

497
00:58:22,005 --> 00:58:23,757
电梯间已经气密
The shaft is air-locked.

498
00:58:23,757 --> 00:58:27,093
但如果爆炸 已经损坏了顶端的电梯间
But if the explosion breached the shaft at surface level...

499
00:58:27,093 --> 00:58:29,880
这里的压力就没有办法 保持水池水面稳定
...we won't have enough pressure to stabilize the wet pool.

500
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:34,455
如果水池的水面压力不够 海水便会大量涌入
If the pool isn't stabilized, there's tons of ocean dying to get in.

501
00:58:34,684 --> 00:58:36,853
说不定会毁掉整座实验室
You'll bring the whole facility down.

502
00:58:36,853 --> 00:58:38,939
冒险面对鲨鱼 生还机率还大一些
We're better off with the sharks.

503
00:58:38,939 --> 00:58:41,566
你想和你的小鱼同游，请便
You want to swim with your fishes? Go ahead!

504
00:58:41,566 --> 00:58:44,102
我要打开这道门爬上去
I'm opening this door and climbing out of here!

505
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:46,780
我不准你这样做 我已经不再听你的命令了
-The hell you are! -I don't work for you anymore!

506
00:58:47,155 --> 00:58:49,074
我不再听命行事 闹够了
-I don't have to take orders! -Enough!

507
00:58:49,366 --> 00:58:51,993
你们全都闹够了吧
That's enough now, from all of you!

508
00:58:56,081 --> 00:58:58,041
你们以为水的动作很快吗？
You think water's fast?

509
00:58:58,041 --> 00:59:02,765
那你们应该见识一下冰的力量 它简直像是有思想一样
You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind.

510
00:59:03,004 --> 00:59:07,008
像是嗜杀成性一样
Like it knows it killed the world once. It got a taste for murder.

511
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:13,306
我们困在雪崩中 花了一个星期才爬出去
When the avalanche came... ...it took us a week to climb out.

512
00:59:14,224 --> 00:59:17,310
不知什么时候 我们失去了求生欲望
And somewhere we lost hope.

513
00:59:19,187 --> 00:59:22,315
我不记得 我们什么时候开始起内哄
I don't know when we turned on each other.

514
00:59:23,567 --> 00:59:25,068
我只知道雪崩时 
I just know...

515
00:59:25,402 --> 00:59:28,113
有七个人还活着
...that seven of us survived the slide...

516
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:31,491
但却只有五个人成功逃出去
...and only five made it out.

517
00:59:33,952 --> 00:59:37,539
我要违反当初发下的毒誓
Now, we took an oath that I'm breaking now.

518
00:59:38,081 --> 00:59:41,751
我们发誓对外宣称 那两个人是死于雪崩
Swore that we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two.

519
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,556
事实并非如此
But it wasn't.

520
00:59:44,588 --> 00:59:46,464
大自然的确致命 
Nature can be lethal.

521
00:59:47,716 --> 00:59:50,385
但杀伤力仍小于人类
But it doesn't hold a candle to man.

522
00:59:53,054 --> 00:59:57,851
你们都已经知道 事态的恶化有多快
You've seen how bad things can get and how quick they can get that way.

523
00:59:57,851 --> 01:00:00,604
但情况还可能雪上加霜
Well, they can get a whole lot worse.

524
01:00:00,604 --> 01:00:04,900
我们不要再争执不休了
So we're not going to fight anymore!

525
01:00:05,317 --> 01:00:09,613
我们要团结起来 想办法离开这里
We're going to pull together and find a way to get out of here!

526
01:00:11,072 --> 01:00:13,533
第一步就是封住这座池子
First, we're going to seal off this pool!

527
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,175
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

528
01:00:41,102 --> 01:00:42,687
鲨鱼把他吃了
It just ate him.

529
01:00:43,605 --> 01:00:45,482
鲨鱼把他吃了
It just ate him. Christ!

530
01:00:46,858 --> 01:00:48,485
我不要走
I'm not moving.

531
01:00:48,818 --> 01:00:51,029
我要留在这里 会有人来救我们的
I'm not moving. Someone will come.

532
01:00:51,029 --> 01:00:54,334
有人会找到我们 我们不会有事的
They'll come and they'll get us, and we'll be fine.

533
01:00:54,407 --> 01:00:57,317
不，我不要走
No. I'm not moving.

534
01:00:57,536 --> 01:01:02,082
听我说，汤姆 实验室受压的临界点为何？
Listen, Tom, what is the precise structural failure limit for Aquatica?

535
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:04,084
三千两百吨
3,200 tons.

536
01:01:04,084 --> 01:01:08,338
如果涌入的水 超过三千两百吨会怎样？
What happens when we get more than 3,200 tons of water in this rig?

537
01:01:11,758 --> 01:01:16,096
最先倒塌的是大梁 它们只能承受七吨
The support struts go first. Their tolerance is about seven tons.

538
01:01:16,346 --> 01:01:18,473
所以它们会像牙签一样折断
They'll crack like toothpicks.

539
01:01:18,473 --> 01:01:22,227
接下来墙会变型 它们只能承受十吨的压力
The walls will buckle. They can't handle more than 10 tons of pressure.

540
01:01:29,693 --> 01:01:31,570
你想留下来亲眼目睹吗？
You want to be here for that?

541
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,412
才怪
Hell, no.

542
01:01:44,749 --> 01:01:47,169
真相就要揭晓了
The moment of truth. Again.

543
01:02:02,726 --> 01:02:04,477
快走…
Go! Go! Go!

544
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:52,223
史考


545
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,407
抓住你了
I got you.

546
01:03:04,955 --> 01:03:06,623
电梯烧起来了
It's burning!

547
01:03:14,256 --> 01:03:15,924
上面被电梯挡死了
The elevator's blocking the top.

548
01:03:15,924 --> 01:03:19,511
如果能够爬到第一层 我们可以改走楼梯
If we make it to Level 1, we can take the stairs out.

549
01:03:55,255 --> 01:03:56,715
我们快离开这儿吧
Let's get out of here!

550
01:03:56,715 --> 01:03:58,466
快走…
Go! Go!

551
01:04:01,803 --> 01:04:03,346
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

552
01:04:03,346 --> 01:04:06,600
如果鲨鱼破门而入的话 会随着水冲到我们身边
If they break through, water will bring them right to us.

553
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,167
第二层还没有完全被淹没 如果我能打开通往第二层的门
Level 2 is only partially flooded. If I can get that door open...

554
01:04:09,217 --> 01:04:13,481
水会流到第二层去 可以为我们争取点时间
...the water will run off there,buy us some time.

555
01:04:16,234 --> 01:04:18,236
你真了不起
Big, real big.

556
01:04:18,528 --> 01:04:21,823
怎么说？ 你真有种
-What's that? -The size of your brass balls.

557
01:04:22,324 --> 01:04:23,825
小心点
Be careful.

558
01:04:33,376 --> 01:04:34,461
快走
Go!

559
01:04:40,425 --> 01:04:42,177
快走…


560
01:05:35,126 --> 01:05:37,201
卡特…


561
01:06:04,718 --> 01:06:06,323
詹妮丝


562
01:06:15,687 --> 01:06:17,147
詹妮丝，不要动
Jan, stay there!

563
01:06:23,716 --> 01:06:25,063
卡特…


564
01:06:25,113 --> 01:06:28,450
快把我拉出来 卡特，我不想死
Get me out of here, Carter! I don't want to die!

565
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,577
抓住我的手
Grab my hand! Come on!

566
01:06:32,204 --> 01:06:33,538
我抓不到
I can't!

567
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:35,165
我抓不到你的手
I can't reach!

568
01:06:37,876 --> 01:06:39,586
快抓住我的手
-Take it! -I can't reach!

569
01:07:25,069 --> 01:07:27,175
史考 什么事？


570
01:07:27,801 --> 01:07:29,970
你开得到上面那扇门吗？
Can you reach that door above you?

571
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,183
太高了
It's too high.

572
01:07:36,393 --> 01:07:38,270
太高了
It's too high.

573
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:02,419
鲨鱼说不定已经游到那层去了
Sharks probably flooded that level too.

574
01:08:35,493 --> 01:08:38,538
还好你们到这边来了 另外一半已经被淹没了
Good thing you came to this side. The other side's underwater.

575
01:08:38,538 --> 01:08:41,491
那只是巧合 我们只是误打误撞
-We didn't exactly plan it. -Yeah, it wasn't planned.

576
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:43,627
只剩下你们了？
Are you all that made it?

577
01:08:50,467 --> 01:08:55,130
我们终于到了第一层 我们现在可以改走楼梯到顶层
We did it. We're on Level 1. We can take the stairs to the surface.

578
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:57,549
楼梯全被淹没了，相信我
The stairs are flooded. Trust me, I know.

579
01:08:57,599 --> 01:08:58,892
你确定？
Are you sure?

580
01:09:00,393 --> 01:09:02,979
上帝，别再折磨我们了
Give us a goddamn break, can't You?

581
01:09:14,574 --> 01:09:16,159
它总是有求必应 
He always answers.

582
01:09:17,202 --> 01:09:20,372
只是未必如你的愿
Sometimes, the answer you get isn't the answer you want.

583
01:09:24,876 --> 01:09:27,170
我们离顶层只有60尺了
We're 60 feet from the surface.

584
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:31,424
这层有紧急逃生门，对吧？
There's an emergency hatch on this level, right?

585
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:34,511
这一层有防止积水用的 紧急抽水机
This level has bilge pumps on it for storm runoff.

586
01:09:34,511 --> 01:09:38,765
如果能够启动紧急发电机的话 可以抽干楼梯的水
If we re-route the emergency generators, we could drain a stairway.

587
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:41,101
你确定吗？
You sure?

588
01:09:41,351 --> 01:09:42,978
你能信任谁？
Who you going to trust?

589
01:09:46,565 --> 01:09:48,191
你 没错
-You. -That's right.

590
01:09:48,191 --> 01:09:49,860
你要信任我
You trust me.

591
01:09:59,411 --> 01:10:02,111
本来讲好明晚要在这里打牌
We had poker here tomorrow night.

592
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:05,917
她拿到一对的时候 总是会冒险一博
She'd always draw to the inside straight when she could've stuck with a pair.

593
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:07,502
她总是满怀梦想
Big dreams.

594
01:10:14,676 --> 01:10:17,512
就算死到临头 也不能降低自己的标准
Even in death: Standards.

595
01:10:19,514 --> 01:10:23,768
詹妮丝是个正常的女人 她屋里一定有用电池的东西
Jan was a healthy girl. Something in here has to run on batteries.

596
01:10:24,728 --> 01:10:29,808
说的好 你们女人会把… 那玩意儿藏在哪里？
-Nice. -Where would a girl keep her... ...thing?

597
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:31,818
你是怎么回事？
What's the matter with you?

598
01:10:39,284 --> 01:10:41,661
我的皮肤开始出血了
My skin's starting to hemorrhage.

599
01:10:42,078 --> 01:10:44,414
鲨鱼闻到血腥味的话… 
The sharks smell the blood.

600
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:47,292
这样可以把伤口盖住
This'll coat it with oil.

601
01:10:47,292 --> 01:10:49,972
卡特，你在下面说的话…
Look, Carter, what you said down there...

602
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:53,256
也许你是对的
...maybe you were right.

603
01:10:54,758 --> 01:10:56,635
我做的一切
Everything I've done...

604
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,431
没有你都不可能成功
...I don't think I could've done it without you.

605
01:11:02,015 --> 01:11:05,769
苏珊，问题就出在这里
I know, Susan. That's the problem.

606
01:11:08,146 --> 01:11:09,606
已经四点了
Four a.m.

607
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:13,818
我明白，真是度日如年啊
I know. One night feels like a whole week.

608
01:11:14,945 --> 01:11:16,279
相对论
Relativity.

609
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,198
你这话什么意思？
What do you mean?

610
01:11:18,198 --> 01:11:20,617
爱因斯坦的相对论
Einstein's theory of relativity.

611
01:11:21,201 --> 01:11:24,704
抓着烧红的铁板时 一秒比一小时还漫长
Grab hold of a hot pan, a second can seem like an hour.

612
01:11:25,163 --> 01:11:30,043
但搂着美女时 一小时比一秒还快
Put your hands on a hot woman... ...an hour can seem like a second.

613
01:11:30,043 --> 01:11:32,504
一切都是相对的
It's all relative.

614
01:11:35,966 --> 01:11:40,595
我在加州理工念了四年 但这是我所听过最精辟的解释
I spent four years at Cal Tech. That's the best physics explanation I've heard.

615
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,933
可以用
It works.

616
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,311
你留下来陪博士
You stay with the doc.

617
01:11:48,311 --> 01:11:53,149
我和史考想办法到实验室去 抽干楼梯间的水
Me and Scoggs are going to try to get to the wet lab... ...drain that stairwell.

618
01:11:56,862 --> 01:11:58,655
神父… 干嘛？
-Preach? -What?

619
01:12:00,782 --> 01:12:02,951
帮我拉拉链
Would you zip me up, please?

620
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:36,985
我们杀了一只 还剩下两只鲨鱼
We got one, there's two sharks left...

621
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:40,355
你居然还在浴室 和博士互吐爱意
...and you and the doc are doing a little bathroom love.

622
01:12:40,405 --> 01:12:43,158
你的毛病有没有药医？
They got a pill for what's wrong with you?

623
01:12:53,752 --> 01:12:57,018
我要到我房里去拿研究资料
I need to get some things from my quarters. Research data.

624
01:12:57,068 --> 01:13:00,050
那些实验真的成功了
The tests, they worked.

625
01:13:00,842 --> 01:13:04,804
已经死了这么多人 别再为你的研究数据害人了
So much death around us, to risk any more life for some numbers....

626
01:13:06,681 --> 01:13:10,865
若我不拿那些资料 他们就都白死了
Without that data, everyone dying isn't just tragic, it's useless.

627
01:13:10,915 --> 01:13:14,658
博士，死亡一向很枉然
Death is always useless, Doctor.

628
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,493
就是这里了
This is it.

629
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:34,292
你留在这里，我马上回来
Stay here. I'll be back before you know it.

630
01:13:36,753 --> 01:13:38,818
卡特…


631
01:14:45,572 --> 01:14:47,073
发生什么事了？
What's going on?

632
01:14:47,532 --> 01:14:49,659
那是什么鬼东西
What the hell's going on? What is that?

633
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:51,361
没事的
It's okay!

634
01:14:51,411 --> 01:14:53,488
你叫什么？ 我们没事的
-What is that? -We're all right!

635
01:14:53,538 --> 01:14:56,124
搞什么鬼？ 没事了
-What the fuck? -It's okay.

636
01:14:57,991 --> 01:14:59,346
没事了…


637
01:14:59,669 --> 01:15:02,047
你不是要回来找我吗？
I thought you were coming back for me.

638
01:15:02,339 --> 01:15:05,300
控制面板被监视器挡住了
One of your monitors is blocking the panel.

639
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,594
来帮我推一下吧
You want to help me move it?

640
01:15:07,594 --> 01:15:10,858
我看我们还是一起行动吧
I say we do everything right together.

641
01:15:11,973 --> 01:15:13,058
一起行动
Right together.

642
01:15:27,572 --> 01:15:28,406

Hello.

643
01:15:29,866 --> 01:15:32,202
我叫做雪曼杜德利
My name is Sherman Dudley...

644
01:15:32,827 --> 01:15:37,760
如果你看到这卷带子的话 表示我已经死了 以下是我的遗言
...and if this message finds you, I did not survive, so this is my legacy.

645
01:15:37,874 --> 01:15:41,378
这辈子我最爱的两件事 第一是传道，第二是喝酒
I have loved the pulpit and I have loved the bottle.

646
01:15:42,295 --> 01:15:46,101
我努力想做个好丈夫，好爸爸
I did my best to be a good husband, a father.

647
01:15:46,925 --> 01:15:48,760
但都没有成功
I came up wanting.

648
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:52,222
我还有什么好说的呢
So what do I have to say to you?

649
01:15:53,598 --> 01:15:56,101
我又留下些什么？
What mark do I have to leave behind?

650
01:16:02,107 --> 01:16:05,527
首先介绍蛋卷的做法 一次打两个蛋，不是三个
We'll begin with the perfect omelet, made with two eggs, not three.

651
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:08,791
那些菜鸟常常会加牛奶 增加浓度，真是大错特错
Amateurs often add milk for density. This is a mistake.

652
01:18:43,602 --> 01:18:45,854
卡特，快来
Come on!

653
01:19:18,512 --> 01:19:20,388

I got you. Come on.

654
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:35,904
你真讨厌，史考
Damn you, Scoggs.

655
01:19:46,831 --> 01:19:48,333
苏珊呢？
Where's Susan?

656
01:19:50,961 --> 01:19:52,003
我惨了，
I'm done.

657
01:19:52,003 --> 01:19:55,715
咱们黑人 碰到这种情况就死定了
Brothers never make it out of situations like this. Not ever!

658
01:23:49,074 --> 01:23:54,381
苏珊…


659
01:23:57,666 --> 01:24:01,221
你们成功了吗，史考呢？
Did you do it? Where's Scoggins?

660
01:24:03,713 --> 01:24:06,500
我不想打断你们
I hate to interrupt this moment of burgeoning intimacy...

661
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:08,468
我们可不可以 快点离开这里啊？
...but can we get the fuck out of here?

662
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:21,481
这是唯一的出路？
-Is this the only way? -Exits are flooded.

663
01:24:21,481 --> 01:24:25,151
出口都已经被淹没了 整个实验室都在下沉 不这样就出不去了
Whole place is sinking. It's this way or no way at all.

664
01:24:26,111 --> 01:24:28,730
你有好消息的话就现在说吧
You can bring on the good news anytime now.

665
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:32,692
鲨鱼会受到混浊的水 及鲜明的颜色所吸引
Sharks are attracted to churning water, bright colors.

666
01:24:32,742 --> 01:24:35,526
这些灭火器 可以让它们暂时分心
These extinguishers will be a distraction.

667
01:24:36,663 --> 01:24:38,123
我们怎么办？
What about us?

668
01:24:38,123 --> 01:24:42,335
我们穿上救生衣 浮出水面速度过快肺脏会爆的
The vest'll bring you up too fast. Your lungs'll pop like a balloon.

669
01:24:43,336 --> 01:24:45,372
你一定不是班上最快乐的小孩
You weren't the sunny kid in your class.

670
01:24:45,422 --> 01:24:47,768
我从来没有上过学
I never went to class.

671
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:50,836
我们离水面有多远？ 60英尺？
How far to the surface? Sixty feet?

672
01:24:50,886 --> 01:24:56,579
没什么大不了的 上升的时候吐气尽快离开水面
There's nothing to it. Exhale on the way up, and get the hell out of the water.

673
01:24:56,975 --> 01:25:00,739
我在打开气密锁之前 得先平衡压力
I got to equalize the pressure before we blow the air lock.

674
01:25:01,313 --> 01:25:07,538
我要让水淹没这个房间 几秒钟之内就完成了
I got to let the room fill up with water. It'll only take a few seconds.

675
01:25:07,944 --> 01:25:09,842
准备好了吗？
You ready?

676
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:11,615

No.

677
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:13,804
准备好才怪
Not in the least.

678
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:38,675
我行经死亡之谷，不畏惧恶魔 因为有你与我同在
''Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... ''...I shall fear no evil... ''...for Thou art with me...

679
01:25:38,725 --> 01:25:46,527
汝之权杖给我慰藉 汝之慈悲，恩慈将长伴我左右
''...Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. ''Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life... ''

680
01:25:46,577 --> 01:25:47,893
因为我带着一根大棍子
...because I carry a big stick...

681
01:25:47,943 --> 01:25:50,604
而且是死亡谷中 最可怕的凶神恶煞
...and I'm the meanest motherfucker in the valley.

682
01:25:50,654 --> 01:25:53,899
我们杀了两只 还剩一只要解决
Two sharks down, Lord. One demon fish to go.

683
01:25:53,949 --> 01:25:55,442
跟我一起说，阿门
Can I get an ''amen''?

684
01:25:55,492 --> 01:25:56,409
阿门
Amen!

685
01:25:56,409 --> 01:25:58,518
我听不到 阿门
-I can't hear you! -Amen!

686
01:25:58,568 --> 01:26:00,259
大声一点
Give me an ''amen''!

687
01:26:00,309 --> 01:26:04,042
保佑我们吧
-Stay with us, Lord! -Amen.

688
01:26:06,253 --> 01:26:08,789
我数到三，准备好了吗？
Okay, hold on three! Ready?

689
01:26:08,839 --> 01:26:11,925
一，二，三
One! Two! Three!

690
01:27:47,103 --> 01:27:48,855
快游
Swim!

691
01:28:26,393 --> 01:28:28,603
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

692
01:29:05,599 --> 01:29:08,310
它们简直是恶魔
It's the devil, you know.

693
01:29:18,862 --> 01:29:22,053
只要我们能离开这儿 他就不会有事的
He'll be okay if we can get out of here.

694
01:29:33,627 --> 01:29:35,495
真该死
Son of a bitch.

695
01:29:35,545 --> 01:29:36,546

What?

696
01:29:36,546 --> 01:29:41,238
怎么了？ 篱笆在水底的部份是钛合金 但在水面上只有钢丝
Those fences are titanium underneath, but on top, they're just plain steel.

697
01:29:43,512 --> 01:29:49,424
是它们把我们赶到这儿来的 利用我们淹没实验室
They've been herding us, pushing us where they want. Using us to flood the facility.

698
01:29:51,186 --> 01:29:53,513
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

699
01:29:53,563 --> 01:29:55,307
那就是谜语的答案
That's the answer to the riddle.

700
01:29:55,357 --> 01:29:59,163
因为这就是那些 八千磅的巨鲨打的主意
Because that's what an 8,000-pound mako thinks about.

701
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:02,280
它们梦想自由
About freedom.

702
01:30:03,156 --> 01:30:05,940
梦想一片蔚蓝大海
About the deep blue sea.

703
01:30:08,245 --> 01:30:10,799
我们一定要杀了它
We have to kill her.

704
01:30:12,332 --> 01:30:16,190
你终于上道了
That's the first real smart thing you've said all day.

705
01:30:20,298 --> 01:30:22,227
我们动手吧
Here we go.

706
01:30:39,067 --> 01:30:40,840
走吧
Let's go.

707
01:30:51,037 --> 01:30:54,791
这些信号弹里的火药应该够了
We ought to get 2.5 sticks of dynamite out of these flares.

708
01:31:00,338 --> 01:31:02,958
你从这上面应该可以看到 我是否射中它
From up here, you ought to be able to see me spear it.

709
01:31:03,008 --> 01:31:08,630
我一射中它，你就将缆线的 这一头接到电池上
When I do, you take this end of this cable... ...hook it up to the positive side of the boat battery.

710
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:11,068
炸得它粉身碎骨
And boom!

711
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:49,421
该死，我射不中它
Damn! I can't get her!

712
01:31:49,471 --> 01:31:51,911
太远了
She's too far away!

713
01:31:53,141 --> 01:31:55,508
我知道如何诱它过来
I know how to get her.

714
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,479
怎么做？
How?

715
01:31:58,104 --> 01:32:01,149
以身做饵 什么？
Bait.

716
01:32:13,537 --> 01:32:16,164
它也许是世上最聪明的动物
She may be the smartest animal in the world...

717
01:32:16,164 --> 01:32:18,792
不过终归还是动物
...but she's still just an animal.

718
01:32:20,335 --> 01:32:22,379
过来吧
Come to Mama.

719
01:32:35,684 --> 01:32:44,401
苏珊，不要…
No! Susan, don't!

720
01:32:58,832 --> 01:33:01,001
快到岸上来
Get out of the water!

721
01:34:55,031 --> 01:34:56,483
好了，上帝…
All right, Lord....

722
01:34:56,533 --> 01:34:58,235
快开枪
Shoot it, Preach!

723
01:34:58,285 --> 01:34:59,945
这是为了史考报仇
This is for Scoggins.

724
01:34:59,995 --> 01:35:01,819
开枪
Shoot it!

725
01:35:08,295 --> 01:35:09,546
该死的
Damn!

726
01:35:15,051 --> 01:35:17,345
快炸了它
Blow it, Preach! Blow it!

727
01:35:17,762 --> 01:35:20,859
快接上电池，把它炸了
The battery! Blow it!

728
01:35:24,603 --> 01:35:26,281
快点
Do it!

729
01:35:53,246 --> 01:35:54,414
该死


730
01:36:24,016 --> 01:36:25,403
卡特


731
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:31,023
帮我带点生鱼片上来
Bring me some sushi!

732
01:36:55,235 --> 01:36:59,135
这么大的目标你居然还打中我
Forty-five-foot shark... ...and you hit me.

733
01:36:59,155 --> 01:37:01,107
真是神准
Nice.

734
01:37:01,157 --> 01:37:04,515
你让高兴我没让它一口吃了你
Could've been worse. I could've let him eat your ass.

735
01:37:11,585 --> 01:37:13,983
卡特，实验室在下沉，对吧？
Carter, we're sinking, right?

736
01:37:14,212 --> 01:37:16,256
没错
Yeah.

737
01:37:16,256 --> 01:37:18,425
我问你一件事
Let me ask you something.

738
01:37:19,718 --> 01:37:22,345
你确定只有三条巨鲨吗？
Are you sure it was just three sharks?

739
01:37:22,554 --> 01:37:24,545
对
Yeah.

740
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:26,276
好吧


741
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:36,057
这还差不多
That's more like it.

742
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:46,161
接班人员来了
Here comes the next shift.

743
01:37:46,995 --> 01:37:51,187
告诉你，我不干了
Let me tell you, man... ...I quit this job.

744
01:37:54,961 --> 01:37:57,641
我宁愿回贫民窟去
Take me back to the ghetto.

745
01:37:57,797 --> 01:37:59,664
阿门
Amen.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
