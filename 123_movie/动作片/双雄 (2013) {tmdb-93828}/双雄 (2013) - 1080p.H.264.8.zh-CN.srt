All rolled out in little coordinates.

and not even argue your point?
你干嘛傻站在那儿不和他们争辩？

as a kid for shoplifting.
发现他小时候曾在一起商店劫案中被拘过

祖卡，快点，伙计，我的面包快凉啦

那家伙是鲁安 斯坦伍德

113

so grab pens 'cause I'm not repeating it.
好哦，我还要问一堆问题，拿上笔，我不会再重复

the same gun as Otis Blake, but this...
弹道分析显示他被枪击欧茨 布莱克的同一支枪所伤，但...

117
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:06,491
...this is the icing.
这也是症结所在

a mobile to a landline in Hella, Iceland.
鲁安完蛋前，给冰岛的Hella的一处座机打过一个电话

2200 hours...
他们已经花费了近2XX小时的时间

121

to shoot to disable.
他们得到的指令是一定要开枪制服对方

122
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:26,889

-没用的

123
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,093
Because it won't.
They need to hold off.
-不管用
-他们该停止行动才对

124
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:32,857
Or let Sternwood think
we haven't clocked on.
或者让斯坦伍德认为我们啥都没干

125
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:35,432
Surround the house, take him when he
moves, that's when he's vulnerable.
包围那房子，攻击并拘捕他

126
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:36,607
Max!
麦克斯！

127
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:38,543
- Say something then.
- No.
-那你来说吧
-没啥说的

128
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,047
Something you want to add, mate?
你想补充点啥么？伙计？

129
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:45,795
No. No.
不，不

130
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,793
It won't work.
这样不管用的

131
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:57,541
Uh, all right, um...
呃，好吧，那啥..

132
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:00,840
Well, what do you think will work...
擦！那你说啥管用..

133
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,557
...Sarah?
莎拉？

134
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:09,191
Well... Nathan...
呃，雷森...

135
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,603
You've gotta...
你们要...

136
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:17,653
Hold off, wait,
停下来，等待，

137
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,488
Surround the house and...
包围房子，然后...

138
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:25,261
Take him when he's least expecting it.
至少像他期待的那样处置他

139
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:26,926
And if I tell them to hold off...
如果我说他们该延迟一下...

140
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:30,576
...and we turn up and find out
that he's got away- again-
我们发现他又跑掉了

141
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:33,333
Who's gonna take the flak? You had no
problem pointing the finger last time.
谁该承担这个责任？你上次就瞎JB搞了一回

142
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:35,804
You disobeyed orders, you paid the price.
你不守纪律，你己付为此出了代价

143
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:42,206
If you're such an expert, mMax, why's he still
at large and why is you not standing up here?
如果你真是砖家，麦克斯，为啥他还逍遥法外，为啥你没有站在本尊这个位置？

144
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,502
I don't give a fuck about any of that stuff.
我受够了这些烂事

145
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:51,122
- Do you know what, mate?
- It's your call.
-你知道么，伙计？
-你的电话

146
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,068
Yeah, it is and it's done.
是啊，就是这样子的，没办法

147
00:21:56,586 --> 00:22:00,478
Max, this is gonna be hard.
Try not to act too smug.
麦克斯，越来越难了，别再清高了

148
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:03,547
Innocent people were killed last
night. I'm not smug about anything.
昨晚又有无辜的人挂掉了，我才不因任何事清高

149
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:04,606
You know what I mean.
你知道我指的是啥

150
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,366
Oh, for god's sake, I'm Robert
Wiseman's campaign manager. Max...
看在神的面上，我是罗伯特 魏茨曼的竞选部长，麦克斯...

151
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:14,429
Tell him who I am. / What? No, I've
never seen her before in my life.
告诉他我是谁。啥？才不，我从没见过她

152
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:19,475
And we're trying to establish whether
there's a link between the two cases.
我们正尝试将两案关联起来

153
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,825
Right, I'll take any questions you might have.
好吧，我会回答你们任何问题

154
00:22:22,252 --> 00:22:25,971
That's two people in a related shooting
and not a single lead to show for it.
这是相关的枪击案中的两个人，而不是孤立事件

155
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:27,337
As I said, we're on top of it.
正如我所言，我们正着手调查

156
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,782
I'm confident it will be
resolved quickly and efficiently.
我相信案子会快速而有效地侦破

157
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:31,783
Thanks.
谢谢

158
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:34,997
How do you react to the shadow home
secretary's claims that we're suffering twice...
你对影子内阁大臣所称的我们正两次遭受...

159
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:37,451
...the level of violent crime
committed in the United States?
米国暴力犯罪激增的评论是？

160
00:22:37,452 --> 00:22:40,438
Well, I'm not gonna get
involved in an election campaign.
嗯，我不对任何涉及竞选的问题评论

161
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:47,350
Suffice to say, whoever takes office on the 21st needs
to ensure the police have all the resources they need...
足以说明，在21世纪任何执政者都需要确保警方拥有所有必要资源...

162
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:51,274
...to carry out their job. \You think what happened
to Sternwood's son will draw him out?
以执行其任务。
你认为斯坦伍德的儿子要怎样才能撇清关系？

163
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,707
I was shot in the leg, Jane, not in the head.
我那次是被击中腿部，简，不是脑袋坏掉了

164
00:22:55,898 --> 00:22:57,322
Don't I know it.
我似乎明白

165
00:22:57,323 --> 00:22:59,134
<i>Arm transport police with tasers.</i>
装备了泰瑟枪的押运警员

166
00:22:59,135 --> 00:23:02,342
<i>Increasing the number of officers
qualified to utilize firearms.</i>
增加了限制使用火器的警员数目

167
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:06,286
- Don't ask.
- Wasn't gonna.
-别提问啦
-不是吗？

168
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:07,287
Next.
下一个问题

169
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:12,035
Your own figures show a 17% increase
in gun crime in the last 12 months.
你们自己的数据显示过去12个月里涉枪犯罪增加了17%

170
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:14,902
I'm not gonna get into a debate
about statistics.
我不会为统计数字辩护

171
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:19,762
If there's no more relevant questions,
I'll bid you all a good morning. Thank you.
如果没有其他相关问题，我要在此祝你们早安啦，谢谢

172
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:24,014
Tough questions.
都是些刁钻的问题哈

173
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:26,299
I've heard worse.
我还听过更刁钻的

174
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:28,295
You ducked them like a pro.
你在回避他们

175
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:30,266
I'd take that as a compliment...
我只把他们当做抱怨罢了

176
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:33,692
If you weren't the shadow
home secretary's campaign manager.
要不是你是影子内阁大臣的竞选部长的话

177
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:36,940
We win this election and you'll get the
backing you need, but for now...
我们早就赢了选举你也会得到你想要的，但是现在

178
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:38,424
...the questions are gonna get tougher.
问题都更艰难了

179
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:40,442
Well, I'm sure you'll spin it
to your own agenda.
嗯，我想信你已经安排妥当一切

180
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,287
The kid at the airport, any
truth he's Jacob Sternwood's son?
那个机场里的孩子，真的是雅各布 斯坦伍德的儿子？

181
00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:50,990
- Where did you get that?
- Come on.
-你从哪儿得知的？
-得了吧

182
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:53,906
I ran your press for five years.
我跟了你五年的新闻记者会啦

183
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:58,250
Could be useful.
可能会有用的

184
00:23:59,258 --> 00:24:01,781
- If it's handled well.
- Yeah.

-是

185
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,468
- See you, Jane.
- See you.
-再见，简
-再见

我要拜会禁枪协会的人，我只有两分钟时间给你

Max and I were just discussing
this Blake case and...
麦克斯和我刚刚讨论过布雷克的案子..

188
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:22,033
We thought there may be a way through
Ruan Sternwood. Didn't we, max?
我们认为可以利用鲁安 斯坦伍德一下，是么？麦克斯？

189
00:24:22,764 --> 00:24:25,908
Uh, yeah! Look, I don't know
about the Blake case, but...
呃...，那啥，我不懂啥布雷克的案子，但是...

190
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:31,721
...if it was me, and it's not me, but if it was,
I'd put Ruan in an open hospital, public...
如果是我管的话，但并不由我管，但是如果由我管，我会把鲁安弄到一个公共医院，公开的

191
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:34,805
...man it 'round the clock, dangle
the hooks, see if Sternwood bites, that's it.
我们的人守候着，亮出这个鱼饵，如果斯坦伍德上钩，就搞定他

192
00:24:35,861 --> 00:24:38,152
- You think you two are up to this?
- Yeah, of course we are.
-你以为你俩能负责这个案子？
-当然我们能

193
00:24:38,923 --> 00:24:41,668
- Aren't we?
- Mm-hmm.
-我们行的对吧？
-呃，嘿

194
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:47,834
- Max? He's still reeling from last time.
- He was bang on about Iceland, wasn't he?
-麦克斯行吗？他上次中枪现在还是跛的呢
-他不停在念叨冰岛的事儿呢，不是么？

195
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:51,718
Look, um, I'm up to it, all right?
好吧，呃，我扛上这事儿了，行不？

196
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:55,924
You leave the Blake case to Nathan and
you stay out of his way, do you understand?
你把布雷克的案子交给雷森，离开他的圈子，明白？

197
00:24:56,582 --> 00:25:00,449
I take your point. You get
the hospital, but that's all.
我替你的位置，你接下医院的活儿，就这样

198
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:02,841
- Thom, he's too close to it.
- Nathan, fuck off.
-托姆，他有点过了
-滚蛋，雷森

199
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:06,327
I'm not too close,
I'm just over it.
我不是太过了，我是被挂得太高了

200
00:25:06,528 --> 00:25:09,034
You won't have a problem then, will you?
有啥问题么？

201
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:22,256
- Do you want me to start on row two?
- No, just start with the "a" class, son.
-你要我按第二方案来吗？
-不，你只执行A方案，儿子那边

202
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:23,257
Yes, boss.
遵命，头儿

203
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:37,439
Jesus, jake. Why don't we just let
off some fireworks while we're at it?
天啊，杰克，为嘛我们来时不放点烟花呢？

204
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,276
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't
a thousand percent, you know that.
如果我不是抓住那千分之一的机会的话就不会在这儿了，你明白

205
00:25:44,358 --> 00:25:45,558
Come here.
这边来

206
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:54,866
- Car was run of the mill?
- It was perfect.
-我的车很差么？

- I've had worse.
-受到攻击了？
-更遭

208
00:25:58,276 --> 00:26:00,006
So why did you level the house?
为什么毁了那间屋子？

209
00:26:00,307 --> 00:26:03,001
Became just another
place to hide- I'd rather see it burn.
只是个藏身之地罢了，我宁愿它烧掉

210
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:09,457
If it's any consolation, you're looking good.
如果需要安慰的话，你看起来还不错

211
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,740
- Great outdoors.
- Mm.
-在户外还不错
-嗯

212
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:12,596
What's that?
这是啥意思？

213
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,284
Karen says I carry it off.
凯伦说我算躲过一劫

214
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:18,059
Oh, does she now? Well,
you look like Kenny Rogers.
哦，她也知道了?好吧，你看起来像大胡子歌手Kenny Rogers

215
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,498
Mmm, I can shave and you'll still
look like a bag of smashed crabs.
嗯，我可以刮掉胡子，但你怎么都像一袋烂螃蟹

216

How is he?

218
00:26:32,566 --> 00:26:33,728
And?
然后呢？

219
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:38,307
Apparently Ruan was involved
in some low-level stuff.
显然弄了些烂人看管着

220
00:26:38,927 --> 00:26:40,509
Nothing serious.
那问题不大

221
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,883
But he started hanging out with
a kid called Otis Blake.
但是他和一个叫欧茨 布雷克的孩子一起出去混

222

All mouth, no muscle.

223
00:26:46,495 --> 00:26:49,483
Ruan raised the cash, using the
family name as leverage.
鲁安提高了价码，用了家庭的名字施加影响

224
00:26:49,884 --> 00:26:51,761
Otis did the deals.

225
00:26:54,677 --> 00:26:57,187
And that's where it
gets complicated.
因此事儿变复杂了

226

Four days ago, Otis was found floating
in the Thames with a bullet in his head.
4天前，欧茨的尸体被发现漂浮在泰晤士河上，头部中枪

The next day, they pick up Ruan at city
airport suffering from a gunshot wound.

They know who he is, Jake.

He's created a legend for
himself, I'll give him that.
他创造了自己的传奇，我很佩服他的

235
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:34,274

Man can kidnap, kill, rob...

237
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,057
...hurt people.

238
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,739
And he gets called a legend.

239
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:55,314
Do well at school, Juka?
Get good marks and all that?

- Hmm?

-嗯
-是哦

241
00:27:58,189 --> 00:28:01,907
So you work hard, you do your best.
所以你勤奋工作，尽你所能

242
00:28:02,428 --> 00:28:06,014
And I guarantee you'll get
remembered as a nobody.
我保证你最终碌碌无为

243
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:10,858
The only lasting thing about Jacob Sternwood
should be his fucking prison sentence.

We're not gonna walk him
out of there.

告诉你，你早该有机会干掉那个条子了

We keep things ticking over.
咱们悠着点，把事儿办周全

You release that Ruan's improved and
that's going to keep Sternwood in play.
你放风说鲁安好转了，这可能会上斯坦伍德上钩

Got it all figured out, haven't you?

Welcome to Hotel Greigo Mar.

You put it out there...
我在想，如果我们把它放在这外面

Ruan Sternwood was staying
at the Greigo Mar Hotel.
假装鲁安 斯坦伍德还在Greigo Mar宾馆的话

- Yeah.

they pulled the trigger.

I take it we're not staying here.
我假装我们不在这里

298
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:34,456
You are. I'm gonna go track down this security
guard, see if he's been squared off by Sternwood.
好，我开始追查这个保安，看他是否被斯坦伍德摆平了

his own son?
什么？你认为他会射杀自己的儿子？

planning something.
不，不，我认为他正在筹划什么阴谋

301
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:40,376
It fucked up and now
he's covering his tracks.
但是搞砸了，所以现在他要隐藏好他那些痕迹

302
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:43,201
Can you just take a step back
for a minute?
你能消停几分钟吗？

303
00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:44,324
What the fuck's that
supposed to mean?
那TM意味着什么呢？

304
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:46,375
Meaning maybe it's not
all about Jacob Sternwood.
意味着这可能不全和斯坦伍德有关

305
00:35:46,376 --> 00:35:47,232
What else is it about?
那会和啥有关？

306
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:49,668
Dean Warns for a start.
And a dead 22-year-old.
从沃茨 迪安的谋杀开始，一个22岁的年轻人被杀

to Jacob Sternwood.
是的，这些都该归咎于雅各布 斯坦伍德

- You?
-我刚刚想出是怎么回事儿了

Right!

is not going to change the past.

00:35:57,436 --> 00:35:58,832
It has to!

that got shot in a tunnel...
我一直想是不是三年前斯坦伍德你没有在隧道里将你枪杀...

Concentrate on now.

at your job to waste it.
因为你太会浪费你的工作了能力了

stay here and cover for me.
你还要守在这里掩护我

323

make sense to you?
我刚说的对你有用吗？

324
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,666
I understood it,
just don't agree with it.
我明白，就是不同意你的话

new school or old school?
我的意思是，你想它是新学校式还是旧学校式呢？

去TM的新式，我会把它贴到facebook, twitter, BBM.QQ，马上！

usually nowadays, cyber-styley.
这就是今天的传福音的方法，网络传道

methods, people on the pavement.
我们上的是旧学校，这是更传统的方式，人们被遗弃在街上

333

Bookies, dog tracks, runners,
bit of a nightmare, but I can do it.
业余赌徒，溜 狗的，跑步的，真是梦魇！但是我能搞定

可能我可以横贯两个阳台，但是会让我困难加倍

statement for?

...in Nigeria, this is reality.
在尼日利来，这就是现实

355

-木有人能获得公正待遇
-对，特别在这个郭佳

near Sternwood for years.
我们有一年不能接近斯坦伍德了

off as your inexperience.

我的意思是，天啊，你差点单枪匹马就捉到他

them to take me back.

I never thanked you for that.

So when you take him down this time,

如果你这次能捉到他，你会狠狠地弄他，是吗？

And I'll make sure the whole
world is watching.

我的确做了点事，我并不以此为豪的事

on this, Max.
