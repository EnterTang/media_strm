1
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:30,442
这个混蛋是个警察
This bastard is a cop.

2
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:34,442
他知道我们通过这艘船运毒品
He knew we were bringing drugs through this boat.

3
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,666
好好照顾他
Take care of him.

4
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:01,574
嘿，把他用塑料袋包起来挂起来
Hey, wrap him up in plastic and hang him up.

5
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:02,574
嘿
Hey.

6
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:04,574
你不能杀他
You can't kill him.

7
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:06,574
为什么? 我不能杀警察吗？
Why? Can't I kill the police?

8
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:09,374
你怎么找到这个地方的？
How did you find this place?

9
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:11,274
我觉得他在追我
I think he's after me.

10
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:12,374
你这个混蛋！
You bastard!

11
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:15,374
你做了什么把警察带来了？
What did you do to bring the police?

12
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:17,274
你..
You...

13
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:19,874
我告诉过你要小心
I told you to be careful.

14
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,234
好了，别说了
Okay, so stop.

15
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:24,234
住手！
Stop it!

16
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,034
我要走了
I'm going.

17
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:35,954
这个月我投了更多的钱
I put in more money this month.

18
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:37,954
那毒品呢？
What about the drugs?

19
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:39,954
我赚了20公斤，马上就好
I'm making 20 kilos. I'll be ready soon.

20
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:41,954
但你必须悄悄行动
But you have to move quietly.

21
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,954
我对日本的毒品交易持怀疑态度
I'm suspicious of the drug sales in Japan.

22
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:50,058
为明天的生物会议做好准备
Get ready for the bio meeting tomorrow.

23
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:27,082
你先置我于危险之中！
You put me in danger first!

24
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,082
过来！
Come here!

25
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,082
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

26
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:31,082
你有危险吗？
Are you in danger?

27
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:32,082
把摄像机放下！
Put the camera down!

28
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:36,082
我从早上开始就要揍你！
I'm going to hit you from the morning!

29
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,082
你怎么了？
What's wrong with you?

30
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:39,082
别打我！
Don't hit me!

31
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:41,082
你在看什么？
What are you looking at?

32
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:42,082
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

33
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:44,082
你打人了？
You hit a person?

34
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:45,082
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:47,082
请进
Come in.

36
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:48,082

进去！
Go in!

39
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:07,146
嘿，站住！
Hey, stop!

40
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:11,146
你怎么了？
What's wrong with you?

41
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:13,146
你怎么了？
What's wrong with you?

42
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:15,146
你到底是什么？
What are you?

43
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:17,146
这是肇事逃逸吗？
Is this a hit and run?

44
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:19,146
走吧
Just go.

45
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:21,146
在我杀了你之前
Before I kill you.

46
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:23,146
我在问你
I'm asking you.

47
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:25,146
别问我
Don't ask me.

48
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:31,146
什么？
What?

49
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:53,158
我会把你所有的纹身都擦掉
I'll erase all your tattoos.

50
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:57,506
别来，别来
Don't come, don't come.

51
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,306
我真的要捅死你
I'm really going to stab you.

52
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:01,206
我要捅死你
I'm going to stab you.

53
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:02,126
太危险了
It's dangerous.

54
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:03,526
你知道的
You know.

55
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:09,262
警察，警察
Police, police.

56
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:10,562
你得快点过来
You have to come quickly.

57
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:11,842
我先来
I'll start.

58
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:13,562
这里，这里，还有这里
Here, here and here.

59
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:15,162
有人受伤了
There's someone who's hurt.

60
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:16,362
你吓到我了
You scared me.

61
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:17,562
不，不是我
No, it's not me.

62
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:18,562
不是我
It's not me.

63
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:19,562
别动
Stay still.

64
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:20,562
不，不是我
No, it's not me.

65
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:21,562
不，不是我
No, it's not me.

66
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:22,862
不，不是我
No, it's not me.

67
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:24,862
不，不是我
No, it's not me.

68
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:26,362
我是广州大学的教职员
I'm a staff member of Gwangsu University.

69
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:27,762
告诉他们你没看见我
Tell them you didn't see me.

70
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:30,962
对不起，但是请尽快把车开走
I'm sorry, but please get the car out of here quickly.

71
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,362
我得去上班了
I have to go to work.

72
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:33,562
很晚了，很晚了
It's late, it's late.

73
00:05:35,562 --> 00:05:37,762
你之前抓到的那些混蛋很坏
Hey, the bastards you caught earlier are being bad.

74
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:39,762
Seocho-dong 刀案
Seocho-dong knife crime case.

75
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:42,362
我有一年没抓到你了，但你是怎么抓到的？
I haven't caught you for a year, but how did you catch it?

76
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:44,362
你看看就知道了
You can tell by looking at it.

77
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:45,362
嘿，Seok-do
Hey, Seok-do.

78
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:47,362
警察正在证明这是真的
The police are proving it as a real thing.

79
00:05:47,762 --> 00:05:49,362
所以我才带你来
That's why I brought you.

80
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:52,362
嘿，但请给我一个好的方式
Hey, but please bring me in a good way.

81
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:54,362
我可没那么容易
Oh, I'm not that easy.

82
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:55,362
我没那么容易
I'm not that easy.

83
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:56,362
我没那么容易
I'm not that easy.

84
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:58,362
我没那么容易
I'm not that easy.

85
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:02,362
警察是什么？
What's a police?

86
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,362
不是很多人吗？
Isn't it a crowd of people?

87
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:09,362
你怎么能把拐杖弄得人山人海？
How do you make a cane a crowd?

88
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:13,362
但是 Seok-do 来了之后，他的表现有所提高
But after Seok-do came, his performance improved.

89
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:14,362
别说了
Stop it.

90
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:15,362
我只能在镜子里看到你的鼻子
I can only see your nose in the mirror.

91
00:06:15,362 --> 00:06:18,362
你20岁的时候，放弃了拳击，开始当警察
When you were 20, you quit boxing and started to police.

92
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:20,362
我找到的时候就感觉到了
I felt it when I found it.

93
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:22,362
嘿，吃一个这个
Hey, have one of these.

94
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:23,362
我给你个球
I'll give you a ball.

95
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:24,362
我妻子给我的
My wife gave it to me.

96
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:26,362
给我
Give it to me.

97
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:27,362
我不会给你的
I don't give it to you.

98
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:28,362
这是用 A 级钢做的
This is made of grade A steel.

99
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:29,362
谢谢你的晚餐
Thank you for the meal.

100
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:31,362
对恢复能量很有好处
It's very good for the recovery of energy.

101
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:34,362
我要留著这个昂贵的一个半
I'm saving this expensive one and half.

102
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:35,362
如果你救了它，你会崩溃的
If you save it, you'll collapse.

103
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,362
全部吃掉
Eat it all.

104
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,362
真是浪费
It's a waste.

105
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:39,362
你吃吗？
Do you eat one?

106
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:41,362
我吃了一半怎么会有好的效果？
How can I have a good effect when I eat half?

107
00:06:41,362 --> 00:06:42,362
我喜欢这个
Um, I like this.

108
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:43,362
很好
Good.

109
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:46,362
这是什么？
What's this?

110
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:48,362
你好
Hello.

111
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:49,362
这些都在哪儿？
Where's all this?

112
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:50,362
是的，你好
Yes, hello.

113
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:51,362
你吃了多少？
How many did you eat?

114
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:53,362
你知道这有多贵吗？
Do you know how expensive this is?

115
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:54,362
我知道什么？
What do I know?

116
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,362
你要这样对我吗？
Are you doing this to me?

117
00:06:57,362 --> 00:06:58,362
是的，没错
Yes, that's right.

118
00:06:58,362 --> 00:06:59,362
你们这些混蛋
You bastards.

119
00:07:00,362 --> 00:07:01,362
是的，是的，是的
Yes, yes, yes.

120
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,362
是的，我明白了
Yes, I see.

121
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:04,362
办公室里有个案子
There's been a case in front of the office.

122
00:07:04,362 --> 00:07:05,362
我得走了
I have to go.

123
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:06,362
手机
Cell phone.

124
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:15,338
在哪里？
Where is it?

125
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:15,838
这边请
This way

126
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:18,158
受害者是一名28岁的女性
The victim is a 28 year old woman

127
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:19,358
她从八楼摔下来
She fell from the 8th floor

128
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:20,958
那边没有闭路电视
There is no CCTV over there

129
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,478
所以我们无法确定死亡时间
So we can't confirm the time of death

130
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:23,838
我们在酒店里看到了闭路电视
We saw a CCTV inside the hotel

131
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:24,838
有一个人和两个人

132
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:26,078
但他离开的时候是一个人
But the man was alone when he left

133
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,518
但是他的脸没有被捕捉到
But his face was not captured

134
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:29,518
这边请
This way

135
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:35,914
我已经联系了死者家属
I've contacted the family of the deceased.

136
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:38,254
嘿，你来了
Hey, you're here.

137
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:40,294
我觉得没有其他证据了
I don't think there's any other evidence

138
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,554
除了在房间里喝酒
other than the drinking in the room.

139
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:43,854
有个关于男人的问题
There's a question about a man.

140
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,754
这不是同义词
It's not a synonymous.

141
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:47,754
为什么不是同义词? 他是外国人吗？
Why is it not a synonymous? Is he a foreigner?

142
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:49,654
我让他们调查一下
I told them to look into it.

143
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:52,614
闭路电视正在追踪受害者的行踪
The victim's whereabouts are being traced by the CCTV.

144
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:53,794
看看有没有目击者
Let's see if there's a witness.

145
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:54,454
好吧
Okay.

146
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:56,354
受害者去了一家俱乐部
The victim went to a club.

147
00:07:56,354 --> 00:07:58,054
手环上写著呢
It was written on the wristband.

148
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:00,714
橘子俱乐部？
Club Orange?

149
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,194
我们先复印一份
Let's get a copy first.

150
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:02,894
好吧
Okay.

151
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:14,754
这是酒店受害者 Go Sun-hee 的尸检报告
This is the autopsy report of the hotel's fallen victim, Go Sun-hee.

152
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:17,954
外伤是颅骨骨折和颅骨破裂
The trauma is a skull fracture and a broken skull.

153
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:20,754
这是在倒下的尸体中常见的症状
It's a common symptom found in fallen bodies.

154
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:23,754
直接原因是心脏骤停
The direct cause is cardiac arrest.

155
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:27,354
病因是血液中的药物
The cause is a drug from the blood.

156
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:27,854
这是..
This is...

157
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,754
等等，毒品？
Wait, a drug?

158
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:30,454
是的
Yes.

159
00:08:30,454 --> 00:08:33,654
这是一种新药，叫兴奋剂
It's a new drug called Hyper.

160
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:36,754
它比可卡因和氟哌啶强多了
It's much stronger than cocaine or filopon.

161
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:39,954
毒性和海洛因一样，所以非常危险
It's as toxic as heroin, so it's very dangerous.

162
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:45,154
在受害者的血液中发现了很多毒品
A lot of drugs have been detected in the victim's blood.

163
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:47,954
她死后有人扔的吗？
So someone threw it after she died?

164
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:48,954
是的
Yes.

165
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:53,678
她和受害者在一个俱乐部里
She was in a club with the victim.

166
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:54,978
她差点惹上麻烦
She almost got into trouble.

167
00:08:54,978 --> 00:08:55,978
这之后再进去
Go in after this.

168
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:56,778
好吧
Okay.

169
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:00,378
嘿，Seok-do
Hey, Seok-do.

170
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:01,978
他说什么？
What did he say?

171
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:05,378
他说他喝了俱乐部的毒品后失去了理智
He said he lost his mind after drinking the drug from a club.

172
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,678
他说他再也没有见过 Go Sun-hee 了
He said he didn't see Go Sun-hee anymore.

173
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:10,378
他一定是喝了药，然后喝了
He must have drunk the drug and drank it.

174
00:09:10,378 --> 00:09:11,978
我会把这个发给缉毒组
I'll send this to the drug squad.

175
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:13,578
我们把这个处理掉
Let's get rid of this.

176
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:15,778
这是谋杀案
This is a murder case.

177
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:16,878
真的吗？
Really?

178
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:18,878
我来吧，别发了
I'll do this. Don't send it.

179
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,806
我们得查查俱乐部的监控录像
We need to check the CCTV at the club.

180
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:26,306
他们不合作
They're not cooperating.

181
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:28,106
我已经发出了搜查令
I've already sent a search warrant.

182
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:29,306
谁是老大？
Who's the boss?

183
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:30,506
有三个老板
There are three bosses.

184
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:32,406
其中一个是李相哲，一个流氓
One of them is Lee Sang-chul, a gangster.

185
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,006
他一直不接电话
He hasn't been answering his phone.

186
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,006
我们走吧
Let's just go.

187
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:37,306
没有搜查令我们怎么去？
How can we go without a warrant?

188
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:38,406
我们可以走了
We can just go.

189
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:39,106
我们不能
We can't.

190
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:41,206
我们想不到夜总会
We can't think of the nightclub.

191
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,906
我们不能进去
We can't go in.

192
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:44,006
为什么不呢？
Why not?

193
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:45,106
水管理太差了
The water management is so bad.

194
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,606
因为你，我们不能进去
We can't go in because of you.

195
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:47,806
因为你，我们不能进去
We can't go in because of you.

196
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:50,806
跟我来
Follow me.

197
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:58,146
就是这里，对吧？
This is the place, right?

198
00:09:58,146 --> 00:09:59,146
是的，橙色
Yes, Orange.

199
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:00,146
我很久没去俱乐部了
It's been a while since I went to a club.

200
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:02,146
这家伙怎么还不来？
Why isn't this guy coming?

201
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,146
看看他，多帅啊
Look at him. He's so handsome.

202
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,146
嘿！
Hey!

203
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,146
他怎么了？
What's wrong with him?

204
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:10,146
他是黑社会吗？
Is he a gangster?

205
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:13,146
嘿，他们在看我们
Hey, they're looking at us.

206
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,146
我害怕，我害怕
I'm scared. I'm scared.

207
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:17,146
看他笑的
Look at him laughing.

208
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:18,146
为什么? 他为什么笑？
Why? Why is he laughing?

209
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:20,146
我要死了
I'm dying.

210
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:23,146
他和你一样是明星吗？
Is he a star like you?

211
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:25,146
也许吧
Well, maybe.

212
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:27,146
老板！
Boss!

213
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:29,146
快点
Hurry up.

214
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:30,146
这是 Ja Dong-moon
This is Ja Dong-moon.

215
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:32,146
江南区的生意就是他做的
He's the one who runs the Gangnam business.

216
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:34,146
很高兴见到你，东月
Nice to meet you, Dong-moon.

217
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:35,146
很高兴见到你，老板
Nice to meet you, boss.

218
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:38,146
我只需要让他进来
I just need to let him in.

219
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:40,146
但如果你是警探，我就有麻烦了
But if you're a detective, I'm in trouble.

220
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:42,146
安静
Be quiet.

221
00:10:42,146 --> 00:10:44,146
我进去
I'll go in.

222
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:48,466
东月！

223
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:49,466
是的，兄弟
Yes, brother.

224
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:50,466
钱呢？
Where's the money?

225
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:51,466
他来了
He's here.

226
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:53,466
你的衣服怎么了？
What's wrong with your clothes?

227
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:54,466
你不是来拿钱的吧？
You're not here to get money, are you?

228
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:55,466
我是个警探
I'm a detective.

229
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:57,466

00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:58,674
不，我有个同事在这里，在 MVP 房间
No, I have a colleague here, in the MVP room.

233
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:00,434
走开
Go away.

234
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:04,994
别碰它，我这么说是因为我认识一个人
Don't touch it, I'm saying this because I know someone.

235
00:12:04,994 --> 00:12:05,954
看看这个
Look at this.

236
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:07,194
走开
Go away.

237
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:09,074
你听不到我说话吗？
Can't you hear me?

238
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:29,794
把钱给我
Give me the money.

239
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:30,794
哦，该死
Oh, shit.

240
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:32,794
回头见

241
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:33,794

嘿，谢谢
Hey, thanks.

243
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,370
你不是经常来吗？
Aren't you coming too often?

244
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,370
这种地方在哪里？
Hey, where is a place like this?

245
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,370
你们没有高吊舱吗？
Don't you have a high-pod?

246
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,370
质量不错，对吧？
The quality is good, right?

247
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,370
我今天要拍张好照片
I'll take a good picture today.

248
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,370
把你知道的都告诉我

249
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,370
哦，兄弟
Oh, brother.

250
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,370
如果你吃得太多，这是..
If you feed too much, this is...

251
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,370
我有麻烦了
I'm in trouble.

252
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,370
我会处理的
Hey, I'll take care of it.

253
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,370
真漂亮
It's beautiful.

254
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
大家好
Hello, everyone.

255
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,858
二，四，六，七，八
Two, four, six, seven, eight.

256
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:12,858
搞什么？
What the fuck?

257
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:14,858
这是毒品，对吧？
This is drugs, right?

258
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:15,358
什么？
What?

259
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:17,558
你这个混蛋
You bastard.

260
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:18,358
你不接受吗？
You're not taking it?

261
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:20,058
这不是营养补充剂
It's not a nutritional supplement.

262
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:20,858
我不接受
I'm not taking it.

263
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:22,058
你这个混蛋
You bastard.

264
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:23,358
你他妈的混蛋，你不接受吗？
You fucking bastard. You're not taking it?

265
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:24,358
嘿，你是我爸爸的..
Hey, you're my dad's...

266
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:28,378
什么，怎么了？
What? What is it?

267
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:28,878
是的
Yeah.

268
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:30,078
拿著
Take it.

269
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:31,878
是毒品
It's drugs.

270
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,378
是毒品吗？
It's drugs?

271
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:33,878
是的
Yeah.

272
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:36,178
给总部打电话，把这个混蛋带走
Call headquarters and take this bastard.

273
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:38,178
从现在开始我要把它放在这里
I'm going to put it in here from now on.

274
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:41,878
我遇到了一些最近不怎么认识的朋友
I met some friends who are too hot to meet these days.

275
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:42,878
很高兴认识你

276
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:43,878
我们走吧
Let's go.

277
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:45,878
我们走吧
Let's go.

278
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:52,218
是谁？
Who is it?

279
00:13:52,218 --> 00:13:52,718
是的
Yeah.

280
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:53,718
是新来的守卫吗？
Is it a new guard?

281
00:13:53,718 --> 00:13:55,718
你不能就这么闯进来，出去
Hey, you can't just come in like that. Get out.

282
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:56,718
嘿，嘿，嘿，等一下
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.

283
00:13:56,718 --> 00:13:57,718
等一下，等一下
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

284
00:13:58,218 --> 00:14:00,718
把这个，这个，还有这个放进去
Put this and this and this in here.

285
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:01,218
是的
Yeah.

286
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:02,718
到底是什么，到底是什么？
So what is it? What is it?

287
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:03,718
差不多吧
There's something like that.

288
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:04,718
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

289
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,718
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

290
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:07,718
效果不错
It came out well.

291
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:08,718
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

292
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:10,718
你为什么把这个放进去？
Why are you putting this in?

293

嘿，看这里

294
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,718
这是什么？
What is it?

295
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:15,218
你为什么把这个放进去？
Why are you putting this in?

296
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:15,718
好吧
Okay.

00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:17,718
不，但是这个..
No, but this...

298
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:18,718
坐下，坐下
Sit down. Sit down.

299
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:19,718
你这个混蛋
You're a fucking bastard.

300
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:22,718
外面有人吗？
Hey, is there anyone out there?

301
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:24,718
操，真的

嘿，不要
Hey, don't.

00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:44,802
好痛
It hurts so much.

306
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:46,402
嘿
Hey.

307
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:47,402
哦，该死！
Oh, shit!

308
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:48,402
你是这里的工人，对吧？
You're a worker here, right?

309
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:49,402
对不起
I'm sorry.

310
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:50,402
老大呢？
Where's the boss?

311
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:53,146
我，我，我，我！
Me, me, me, me!

312
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:54,146
我没开玩笑！

313
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:57,146
我，我，我，我！

315
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:01,146
我，我，我，我！
Me, me, me, me!

316
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:02,146
哦，该死！
Oh, shit!

317
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:05,146
等等，等等
Wait, wait, wait.

318
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:08,146
该死，是警卫吗？
Oh, shit! Is it a guard?

319
00:15:08,146 --> 00:15:09,146
李相哲
Lee Sang-chul.

320
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:10,146
李相哲？
Lee Sang-chul?

321
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:12,146
你个狗娘养的！
You son of a bitch!

322
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:16,146
哦，该死！
Oh, shit!

323
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:20,146
你怎么了？
What's wrong with you?

324
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,146
怎么了? 你是黑社会吗？
What's wrong? Are you a gangster?

325
00:15:22,146 --> 00:15:24,146
不，他是个流氓
No, he's a gangster.

326
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:29,146
你们这些混蛋

327
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:30,146
嘿，万子，干得好

是的
Yes.

329
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:32,146
你要上哪辆车？
Which car are you getting in?

330
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:34,146
这是什么？
What's this?

331
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:36,146
锡珠，干得好
Oh, Seok-joo, good job.

332
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:37,146
就这些吗？
Hey, is that all?

333
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:38,146
等一下
Wait a minute.

334
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,146
这只是个开始
It's just the beginning.

335
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:41,146
警察是真的
The police are real.

336
00:15:41,146 --> 00:15:42,146
我们得把他们都抓起来
We need to catch them all.

337
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,530
你来了
You're here.

338
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,530
我在这里
I'm here.

339
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:54,354
你来了，兄弟
You're here, brother.

340
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,354
好久不见
Long time no see.

341
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,354
好久不见
Long time no see.

342
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:57,354
打个招呼

343
00:15:57,354 --> 00:15:58,354
这位是白先生

我在朝鲜的客户都是赵先生的

348
00:16:06,354 --> 00:16:09,354
他的产品和饮料是最好的

349
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:13,354
这是我们公司的总裁

350

这是我们的客户，乔先生

很高兴见到你，总统先生

352
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:21,354
我是总统

353
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:33,274
这不是 Hyper 吗？
Isn't this Hyper?

354
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:36,714
我听说日本出了点问题
I heard there's a problem in Japan.

355
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:38,554
现在很难得到了
It's hard to get it now.

356
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:41,114
问他们要点钱没关系
It's okay to ask them for a few dollars.

357
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:43,914
价格比日本低
The price is lower than in Japan.

358
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:51,290
你能卖多少？

359
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,090
你能买多少？
How much can you buy this?

360
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,930
娇威，你人真好

361
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,290
你想要多少？

362
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,490
我们要多少？

363
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,458
我后天给你20公斤
I'll give you 20kg of it the day after tomorrow.

364
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:11,058
20公斤价值3000亿韩元
20kg is worth about 300 billion won.

365
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:13,058
你觉得怎么样？
What do you think?

366
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:25,346
好吧
Okay.

367
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:31,738
这是合同
This is the contract.

368
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:34,538
如果交易成功,
If this deal is successful,

369
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:36,938
我们可以继续做生意
we can keep the business going.

370
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:39,738
从现在起你可以指望我们了
You can count on us from now on.

371
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,778
剩下的交给我
I'll take care of the rest.

372
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:47,178
别担心
Don't worry.

373
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:49,578
他们会搞定海关的，别担心
They'll take care of the customs. Don't worry.

374
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:51,378
好了，走吧
Okay. Come on.

375
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:52,778
我们都是兄弟
We're all brothers.

376
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:56,278
这是闭路电视吗？
Is this the CCTV?

377
00:17:56,378 --> 00:17:56,978
是的
Yes.

378
00:17:56,978 --> 00:17:58,978
就是他带走了死去的高善日
He's the one who took the dead Ko Sun-il.

379
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,478
停，停
Stop. Stop.

380
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:01,978
你
You.

381
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,778
质量很差
The quality is bad.

382
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:06,378
带上俱乐部主席
Bring the club president.

383
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,178
是的
Yes.

384
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:10,978
你到底认不认识他？
Do you know him or not?

385
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,650
如果你不告诉他我在你店里卖毒品,
If you don't tell him that I sold drugs in your store,

386
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,750
我会骂你的
I'll scold you.

387
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,750
我不是说我不认识他
I'm not saying I don't know him.

388
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,650
我真的不认识他
I really don't know him.

389
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,150
那些混蛋想在不告诉老板的情况下卖毒品
Those bastards are trying to sell drugs without telling the boss.

390
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,350
我怎么知道？
How do I know that?

391
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,950
但是韩国警方
But the Korean police

392
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,650
不能逮捕这么重的人
can't arrest such a heavy person

393
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,750
未经允许就进行调查
and investigate it without permission.

394
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,750
这就是为什么人们说它是假的
That's why people say it's fake.

395
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,450
嘿，给我倒杯咖啡
Hey, get me a cup of coffee.

396
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,150
我？

397
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,850
是的，我在跟你说话
Yes, I'm talking to you.

398
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,950
嘿，小心点
Hey, be careful.

399
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,450
这家伙有大麻烦了
This guy is in big trouble.

400
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,150
不，不
No, no.

401
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,950
如果你再报道一次闭路电视，我就惩罚你
If you cover the CCTV one more time, I'll punish you.

402
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,150
那就让我们把真理之屋打扫干净
Then let's clean up the room of truth.

403
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,150
是时候清理一下了
It's time to clean up.

404
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,750
Park Rae-ah.
Park Rae-ah.

405
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,650
是的
Yes.

406
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,150
我不想这么做
I don't want to do it.

407
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:15,274
里面有很多灰尘
There's a lot of dust in there.

408
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:21,514
他怎么了？
What's wrong with him?

409
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:23,514
嘿，这样看著他
Hey, look at him like this.

410
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:25,514
嘿，嘿，嘿
Hey, hey, hey.

411
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:27,514
嘿，嘿，嘿
Hey, hey, hey.

412
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:31,514
没事了，没事了
It's okay, it's okay.

413
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,514
坐直了，坐直了
Sit straight, sit straight.

414
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:35,514
你不舒服
You're not feeling well.

415
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:37,514
没事了，没事了
It's okay, it's okay.

416
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:39,514
现在，开始吧
Now, start.

417
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:41,514
我们的贵宾每周来一次
It's our VIP who comes once a week.

418
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,514
每次我来，我都会卖一个大的
Every time I come, I sell a big one.

419
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:45,514
即使加班，他们也假装不知道
They pretended not to know even if they were working overtime.

420
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:47,514
我不会卖的
I'm not going to sell it.

421
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:49,514
又来？
Again?

422
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:51,650
仅此而已
That's all.

423
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,650
我们再收拾一下
Let's clean up again.

424
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,650
等一下
Wait a minute.

425
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,650
求你了

426
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,234
好吧
Okay.

427

继续
Keep going.

428
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:04,562
他是最受欢迎的人
He's the most popular guy.

429
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:06,562
他从去年开始就是仁川的毒贩
He's a drug dealer from Incheon since last year.

430
00:20:06,562 --> 00:20:08,562
我得到它是因为我有钱
I got it because I had money.

431
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:12,562
我们俱乐部不卖真正的毒品
Our club doesn't sell real drugs.

432
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,562
是真的
It's real.

433
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,562
不是在江南就是在仁川
It's either in Gangnam or Incheon.

434
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,562
我不知道
I don't know.

435
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:20,562
好吧
Okay.

436
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:22,562
把他交出来，打电话给通讯公司
Hey, hand him over and call the communications company.

437
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:24,562
找到 Hiroshi 的位置
Get the location of Hiroshi.

438
00:20:24,562 --> 00:20:26,562
我会杀了首尔的毒贩子
I'll kill the drug dealers in Seoul.

439
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:28,562
谁要去仁川？
Who's going to Incheon?

440
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,562
我带孩子们去仁川
I'll take the kids to Incheon.

441
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,562
好吧，带他走
Okay, take him.

442
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:34,562
是的
Yes.

443
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:36,562
所以东宇说的是
So what Dong-woo said is

444
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:38,562
是的
Yes.

445
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:40,562
江南区的总统还在喷洒毒品
The president of Gangnam is still spraying drugs.

446
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:42,562
你就是这个意思
That's what you're saying.

447
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:44,562
那是富人的高级酒吧

448
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:46,562
只有会员才能参加

449
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:48,562
他还在那里喷洒秘密药物

450
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:50,562
但我绝不会进去
But I'm never going in there.

451
00:20:50,562 --> 00:20:52,562
郑总统的弟弟是黑社会
President Jung's brother is a gangster.

452
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:54,562
如果被抓到，我会死的
I'll die if I get caught.

453
00:20:54,562 --> 00:20:56,562
总之，我把俱乐部弄坏了
Anyway, I broke the club.

454
00:20:56,562 --> 00:20:58,562
多亏了你，我要逃跑了
Thanks to you, I'm running away.

455
00:20:58,562 --> 00:21:00,562
如果我不让你去,
Hey, if I don't let you go there,

456
00:21:00,562 --> 00:21:02,562
下次我就放你走
I'll let you go next time.

457

这是一，二，三，四

嘿，这里？

459
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:08,562

Yes.

460
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:12,650
门锁上了，你个混蛋
The door's locked, you bastard.

461
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,650
我不知道
I don't know that.

462
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,650
等等
Oh, wait a minute.

463
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,650
我进去
I'll go in.

464
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,650
没事的，你得去看看
It's okay. You have to check it out.

465
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,650
喂，车东云

466
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,650
你好，俊秀

你怎么进来的？
How did you get in?

468
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,650
你们是什么人？
What are you guys?

469
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,946
你把门弄坏了吗？
Did you break the door?

470
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,946
你把门弄坏了吗？

00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:38,946
对不起
I'm sorry.

474
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:40,946
振洙，是谁？
Jin-su, who is it?

475
00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:42,946
没什么
It's nothing.

476
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:44,946
我是来见荣格校长的
I'm here to see President Jung.

477
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:46,946
我妹妹是你的朋友吗？

478
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:48,946

冷静点
Calm down.

482
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,946
警徽..
The badge...

483
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:58,946
你疯了
You're out of your mind.

484
00:21:58,946 --> 00:22:00,946
起来
Get up.

485
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,490
是警察

00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,490
你是谁？
Who are you?

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,490
你凭什么毁了我的生意？
Who are you to ruin my business?

488
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,490
你到底是谁？

489
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,490
是警察
It's the police.

490
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,490
郑会长？
President Jung?

491
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,490
你说你卖毒品
You said you sold drugs.

492
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,490
药呢？
Where's the medicine?

493
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,490
我都听到了
I heard everything.

494
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,490
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

495
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,490
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

等一下
Wait a minute.

498
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,490
别碰它
Don't touch it.

499
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,490
为什么这里有个抽屉？
Why is there a drawer here?

500
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,490
那里可能有个抽屉
There could be a drawer there.

501
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,490
发生什么事了？
What's going on?

502
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,490
不，告诉我
No, talk to me.

503
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,490
什么事？
Yes?

504
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,490
警探
Detective.

505
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:54,618
嘿，你难过吗? 坐直了
Hey, are you sad? Sit straight.

506
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:57,618
你怎么敢打警察，你这个混蛋
How dare you punch the police, you bastard.

507
00:22:57,618 --> 00:23:00,618
如果你告诉我真相，我就让你上去
And if you tell me the truth, I'll let you go to the top.

508
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:02,618
快点告诉我
Tell me quickly.

509
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:06,618
事实上，我父亲在我小时候是个酒鬼
Actually, my father was an alcoholic when I was young.

510
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,618
嘿，嘿，嘿

00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:14,618

515
00:23:15,618 --> 00:23:17,618
我每周去一次商店

516
00:23:17,618 --> 00:23:18,618
起初，我在仁川遇见他
At first, I met him in Incheon.

517
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:20,618
药是从仁川运来的吗？
Is the medicine coming from Incheon?

518
00:23:20,618 --> 00:23:22,618
他自己做的
He made it himself.

519
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:25,618
我听说他是从日本来的黑社会
I heard he's a gangster from Japan.

520
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:26,618
日本黑帮？

521
00:23:28,618 --> 00:23:32,514
兄弟，我查过 Hee-ro 在仁川
Brother, I checked that Hee-ro is here in Incheon.

522

他是日本黑帮的

524
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,514

528
00:23:40,514 --> 00:23:41,514

529
00:23:43,514 --> 00:23:45,778
我应该去吗？
Should I have gone?

530
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:16,098
是谁？
Who is it?

531
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:19,398
嗯..
Um...

532
00:24:20,718 --> 00:24:25,130
这是什么样的疯子？
What kind of crazy bastard is it?

533
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:06,634
你这个混蛋！
You bastard!

534
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:08,634

00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:13,634
拦住他！
Stop him!

537
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:26,042
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

538
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:28,042
我要死了
I'm dying.

539
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:31,042
这是什么？
What's this?

540
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:34,042
你们这些混蛋！
You bastards!

541
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:36,042
你从哪儿弄来的？
Where did you get this?

542
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:38,042
这是警用枪
This is a police gun.

543
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:40,042
你不会说韩语吗？
Can't you speak Korean?

544
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:41,042
你在笑吗？
Are you laughing?

545
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:43,042
你吸毒，杀人

我会让你做这做那至少30年
I'll make you do this and that for at least 30 years.

你笑是因为你明白这一点

548

队长，我来了

553
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:02,786
你们以为抓不到我吗？
You guys thought you wouldn't catch me?

554
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:05,786
这混蛋家里还有很多毒品

565
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:56,794

568

我从没见过你

570
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:35,202
嘿，你不教你的孩子吗？
Hey, don't you teach your kids?

571
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,202
不！
No!

572
00:28:37,202 --> 00:28:38,202
住手！
Stop it!

573
00:28:39,202 --> 00:28:40,202
你为什么要这样对我？
Why are you doing this to me?

574
00:28:43,202 --> 00:28:45,202
你疯了吗? 你从警察那里偷药？
Are you crazy? You're stealing medicine from the police?

575
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:56,618

If Chairman Lee Chil-joo finds out, we'll all die.

你们都会死

580
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,410
这是明天和白总的交易

00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,550
别碰我
Don't touch me.

587
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,350
别碰我
Don't touch me.

588
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,310
我来吧
I'll do it.

589
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,110
钟书记！
Secretary Jong!

590
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,350
钟书记！
Secretary Jong!

591
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,710
哦，天啊
Oh, my.

592
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,550
坐下
Sit down.

593
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,110
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

594
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,510
发生什么事了？
What happened?

595
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,650
对不起
I'm sorry.

596
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,050
你抱歉什么？
What are you sorry for?

597
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,050
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

598
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,850
我们没事
We're okay.

599
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,050
我们没事
We're fine.

600
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,350
泰秀呢？
What about Tae-su?

601
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,450
他在急诊室
He's in the emergency room.

602
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,110
他的头伤得很重
He's hurt his head a lot.

603
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,750
哦，天啊
Oh, my.

604
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,898
如果你今天想把这些都发出去,
If you want to send all of this today,

605
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:05,398
你得快点
you have to hurry.

606
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:07,658
天哪，今天是蓝蟹吗？
Oh, my. Is it blue crab today?

607
00:30:07,658 --> 00:30:10,998
闻起来很可疑
It smells fishy.

608
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:14,198
放进去
Put it deep inside.

609
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:16,198
什么？
What?

610
00:30:16,198 --> 00:30:18,598
你好，好久不见
Hello. Long time no see.

611
00:30:18,598 --> 00:30:19,458
什么？
What?

612
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:20,798
你现在就来吗？
You're coming now?

613
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:22,398
哦，是的
Oh, yes.

614
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:24,498
嗨
Hi.

615
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:27,198
嘿，Tomo 来了
Hey, Tomo is coming.

616
00:30:27,198 --> 00:30:28,398
那个狗娘养的
That son of a bitch.

617
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:30,458
他说他会来的
He said he was coming.

618
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:32,998
但我准备了很多
But I prepared a lot.

619
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,598
生意..
Business is...

620
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:36,098
什么? 他已经来了？
What? He's already here?

621
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:36,898
他为什么这么快？
Why is he so fast?

622
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:40,498
他平时动作很慢
He's usually so slow.

623
00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:44,058
欢迎来到日本
Welcome to Japan.

624
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:46,358
这次我要打开
I'm going to open this time.

625
00:30:49,562 --> 00:30:51,562
怎么样，找到了吗？
How did it go? Did you find it?

626
00:30:52,762 --> 00:30:54,762
再看看这个
Check this again.

627
00:31:00,562 --> 00:31:02,562
这是什么? 一团糟
What is this? It's a total mess.

628
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,362
这事很紧急，所以赶紧收拾干净
It's urgent, so wrap it up clean.

629
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:15,386
我听说 Hee-ro 死了
I heard that Hee-ro is dead.

630
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:17,386
我们的生意有什么问题吗？
Isn't there a problem with our business?

631
00:31:17,386 --> 00:31:19,386
说话注意点
Watch your mouth.

632
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:21,386
就算你逼我，你也不知道
You don't know even if you make me do it.

633
00:31:21,386 --> 00:31:23,386
你不知道，你明白吗？
You don't know. Do you understand?

634
00:31:23,386 --> 00:31:25,386
我明白
I understand.

635
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,386
你负责处理 Hee-ro 的尸体
You're in charge of the dead Hee-ro.

636
00:31:31,386 --> 00:31:33,386
我已经和我的搭档谈过了
I've already finished talking to my partner.

637
00:31:33,386 --> 00:31:35,386
真的吗，太棒了！
Really? Awesome!

638
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:37,386
那你不该把我介绍给你的搭档吗？
Then shouldn't you introduce me to your partner?

639
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:42,450
你不知道
You don't know.

640
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,450
听我说
Just listen to me.

641
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,450
我不需要知道
Yeah, I don't have to know.

642
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,450
我只是需要赚钱
I just need to make money.

643
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,450
嘿，包起来给他
Hey, wrap it up and give it to him.

644
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,450
这条鳗鱼不错
Hey, this eel is good.

645
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,450
多吃点，早日康复
Eat a lot and get better soon.

646
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,450
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

647
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,450
但你什么都没看见？
But you didn't see anything?

648
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,450
监控录像拍到你晕倒了
CCTVs around you fainted.

649
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,450
我觉得他一开始就在跟踪我们
I think he followed us in the first place.

650
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,450
嘿，你吃东西的时候为什么跟我说话？
Hey, why are you talking to me when you're eating?

651
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,450
嘿，吃了它
Hey, eat it.

652
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,450
你不知道印象的不同吗？
You don't know the impression difference?

653
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,450
是的，太黑了
Yes, it was too dark.

654
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,450
我吃完再吃
I'll eat it later after I eat.

655
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,450
你为什么不吃? 很好吃，对吧？
Why don't you eat? It's delicious, right?

656
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,450
嘿！
Hey!

657
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,450
东姑，你在干什么？
Dong-gu, what are you doing?

658
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,450
我是来工作的，你没什么事吧？
I'm here for work. You didn't have anything to do, did you?

659
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,450
是啊，是啊
Yeah, yeah.

660
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,450
这是和我一起工作的哥哥
This is my brother who worked with me.

661
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,450
我很久没来这里了
It's been a while since I've been here.

662
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,450
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

663
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,450
我叫黄东固，是北方的毒贩子
I'm Hwang Dong-gu, a drug dealer in the North.

664
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,450
我是宫泰日
I'm Gong Tae-il.

665
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,450
发生什么事了？
What's going on?

666
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,450
你能看看这个吗？
Can you take a look at this?

667
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,450
这是什么？
What is this?

668
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,450
你知道这个吗？
Hey, do you know this?

669
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,450
我想我们是从 Hee-ro 家拿的
I think we took it from Hee-ro's house.

670
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,450
我要了
I'll take it.

671
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,450
是的，这是我们队长的枪
Yes, this is our team leader's gun.

672
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,450
我们的队长
Our team leader

673
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,450
他已经失踪好几天了
It's been a few days since he went missing.

674
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,450
他失踪了？
He's missing?

675
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,450
我们的队长也调查了超光速
Our team leader also investigated the hyper.

676
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:02,618
原来是个警察局
It was originally a police station.

677
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:04,618
我们的队长一直说有点不对劲
Our team leader keeps saying something's weird.

678
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:06,618
我觉得他一直在单独调查和日本黑帮有点纠葛
I think he's been investigating separately and got a little tangled up with the Yakuza.

679
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:10,618
日本黑帮什么时候开始的？
When did the Yakuza start?

680
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:12,618
给你
Here you go.

681
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:14,618
据我的线人说,
According to my informant,

682
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,618
三年前，日本黑帮和白相狼
Three years ago, the Yakuza and the White Sang-upa

683
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:18,618
他们联合起来，向超能力者喷射
They're united and sprayed the hyper.

684
00:33:18,618 --> 00:33:20,618
但两年前,
But two years ago,

685
00:33:20,618 --> 00:33:22,618
两个白相狼被杀了
Two of the White Sang-upa were killed.

686
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:24,618
当时，栗永西正宗大
At that time, the Kuryongseo Masoo Dae

687
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:26,618
我把所有的白人都叫来了
I got all the white Sang-upa guys.

688
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,618
我看不到药
I couldn't see the medicine.

689
00:33:28,618 --> 00:33:30,618
但是黑帮的人和谁在一起
But who the Yakuza guys were with.

690
00:33:30,618 --> 00:33:32,618
这艘飞船又开始旋转了
This hyper started to spin again.

691
00:33:32,618 --> 00:33:34,618
谁是负责这件事的警探？
Who's the detective in charge of this?

692
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:38,618
没有，但我去了别人的公司
No, but I came to someone else's company.

693
00:33:38,618 --> 00:33:40,618
我要你给我看调查记录
I'm asking you to show me the investigation record.

694
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,618
是不是有点？
Isn't it a little bit?

695
00:33:42,618 --> 00:33:44,618
没有，但这是队长
No, but here's the team leader.

696
00:33:44,618 --> 00:33:46,618
有人告诉我要做好工作
I was told to do a good job.

697
00:33:46,618 --> 00:33:48,618
白相霸
White Sang-upa.

698
00:33:48,618 --> 00:33:50,618
他一个人进去，解决了所有问题
He went in alone and solved everything.

699
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:52,618
有两支特种部队
There are two special forces.

700
00:33:52,618 --> 00:33:54,618
我会说些奇怪的话吗？
Would I say something weird?

701
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:56,618
嗯
Uh.

702
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:08,634
抱歉让你久等了
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

703
00:34:08,634 --> 00:34:10,534
我是朱松哲，毒品调查组的组长
I'm Ju Sung-chul, the team leader of the Drug Investigation Unit.

704
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:11,934
是的，我是马锡道
Yes, I'm Ma Seok-do.

705
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:13,034
你是光州人？
You're from Gwangsu-do?

706
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:14,734
是的，我是 Kim Man-jae
Yes, I'm Kim Man-jae.

707
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:15,874
是的
Yes.

708
00:34:15,874 --> 00:34:16,574
请坐
Please sit.

709
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:17,474
是的
Yes.

710
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:19,482
请坐
Please sit.

711
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:24,894
我听说员工出事了
I heard that the employees were in an accident.

712
00:34:24,894 --> 00:34:27,494
我好难过
I'm so upset.

713
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:29,794
我们必须除掉这些坏蛋
We have to get rid of these bad guys.

714
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:32,294
这就是我来这里的原因
That's why I came here.

715
00:34:32,294 --> 00:34:35,494
我听说这和日本黑帮有关
I heard that this is related to the Yakuza.

716
00:34:35,494 --> 00:34:37,694
你有什么能告诉我的吗？
Is there anything you can tell me?

717
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,690
我们还在调查
We're still investigating.

718
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,590
但是有很多事情我们还没有确认
But there are a lot of things that we haven't confirmed yet.

719
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,290
所以我不能什么都告诉你
So I can't tell you everything.

720
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:52,558
我想看看我儿子的脸
I want to see my son's face.

721
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:53,958
我知道
I know.

722
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,358
我也想看看他的脸
I want to see his face, too.

723
00:34:58,498 --> 00:35:00,098
那我们得快点了
Then we should hurry up.

724
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:00,998
等等
Wait.

725
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,498
我觉得我们陷得太深了
I think we went too deep.

726
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:04,798
别说了
Let's stop.

727
00:35:05,598 --> 00:35:09,198
对不起，我们有机会再来
I'm sorry, but we'll come back when we have a chance.

728
00:35:09,298 --> 00:35:10,398
没关系
It's okay.

729

我不舒服

730
00:35:13,298 --> 00:35:14,498
伙计们
You guys.

731
00:35:16,186 --> 00:35:18,186
交给我们吧
Please leave it to us.

732
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:19,586
有发现我们会通知你的
We'll call you if we find anything.

733
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:20,786
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

734
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,386
等等
Wait.

735
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,686
为什么？
Why?

736
00:35:23,486 --> 00:35:25,986
你认识郑京植吗，北方的队长？
Do you know Jeong Kyung-sik, the team leader of the North?

737
00:35:25,986 --> 00:35:27,186
他失踪了
He's missing.

738
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:28,186
嘿
Hey.

739
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:29,786
谁？
Who?

740
00:35:29,786 --> 00:35:31,286
郑京植
Jeong Kyung-sik.

741
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,050
你是说北境的队长吗？
You mean the team leader of the North?

742
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,350
作为一名警察，我很抱歉这么说
I'm sorry to say this as a police officer.

743
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,250
他有问题
He had a problem.

744
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,050
什么问题？
What problem?

745
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,150
我们有保安
We're under security.

746
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,450
我不能告诉你细节
I can't tell you in detail.

747
00:35:49,254 --> 00:35:51,354
这不是你的案子
It's not your case.

748
00:35:51,354 --> 00:35:54,854
我觉得再问下去很不礼貌
I think it's rude to ask you any more.

749
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,154
你很敏感
You're sensitive.

750
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:00,786
嘿
Hey.

751
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:01,586
别说了
Stop.

752
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:02,586
好吧
Okay.

753
00:36:03,886 --> 00:36:05,086
好吧
Okay.

754
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:06,086

如果你发现了什么，请联系我们

谢谢你

761
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,250
嘿，嘿，嘿，名片变了，我给错你了
Hey, hey, hey, the business card has changed. I gave it to you wrong.

762
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,250
不，不，别走，反正我也不会联系你
No, no, don't go. I'm not going to contact you anyway.

763
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,250
他为什么要联系你？
Why would he contact you?

764
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,250
你去吗？
Are you going?

765
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,250
哦，该死
Oh, shit.

766
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,250
你会还给我吗？
Are you going to give it back?

767
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,250
不，我给了他一张中国名片
No, I gave him a Chinese business card.

768
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,250
去吧
Go.

769
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,250
我觉得他们有什么不舒服的地方
I think they're uncomfortable with something.

770
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,250
我让你不舒服了
I made you uncomfortable.

771
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,250
我只是觉得你是个好人
I just saw that you're a good person.

772
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,250
你喜欢什么？
What do you like?

773
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,250
他和我一样英俊潇洒，但他感觉不太好
He's handsome and handsome like me, but he doesn't feel good.

774
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,354
为什么? 什么？
Why? What?

775
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:10,354
我什么都没说
I didn't say anything.

776
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,354
对了，副经理让我给你打电话
Oh, right. The deputy manager asked me to call you.

777
00:37:13,354 --> 00:37:14,354
为什么？
Why?

778
00:37:14,354 --> 00:37:16,354
我必须在正式程序之后进行调查
I have to investigate after the formal procedure.

779
00:37:16,354 --> 00:37:18,354
他告诉我不要这样走来走去
He told me not to go around like this.

780
00:37:18,354 --> 00:37:20,354
我觉得副经理对你了解太多了
I think the deputy manager knows too much about you.

781
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:21,354
我太了解了
I know too well.

782
00:37:22,354 --> 00:37:24,354
但是如果你这么做，你会错过所有的罪犯
But if you do that, you'll miss all the criminals.

783
00:37:26,354 --> 00:37:28,354
是啊，东姑，东姑
Yeah, Dong-gu, Dong-gu.

784
00:37:29,354 --> 00:37:31,354
你跟我说的那些信息呢？
Where's the information you told me about?

785
00:37:32,354 --> 00:37:34,354
我在车里
I'm in the car.

786
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:35,354
我在车里
I'm in the car.

787
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:40,418
嘿，今天吃肉，明天睡个好觉

788
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:41,418

789
00:37:42,418 --> 00:37:44,418
你收到我寄给你的东西了吗？
Did you get all the goods I sent you?

790
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:45,418
我会好好洗的
I'll wash it well.

791
00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:46,418
我要走了
I'm going.

792
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,410
那是什么鬼东西？
What the hell is that?

793
00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:07,282
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

794
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:08,082
嘿！
Hey!

795
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:09,082
下车！
Get out of the car!

796
00:38:09,082 --> 00:38:10,082
你打算怎么办？

797
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:11,082
下车！
Get out of the car!

798
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,082
怎么了，不管用吗？
What? It's not working?

799
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,082
别这么做
Don't do it.

800
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:16,082
他把香肠塞进耳朵里了吗？
Did he put a sausage in his ear?

801
00:38:16,082 --> 00:38:17,082
嘿！
Hey!

802
00:38:17,082 --> 00:38:19,082
下车！
Get out of the car!

803
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,410
你健身了吗？
Did you work out?

804
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,410
你是 Chorong 对吧？
You're Chorong, right?

805
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,410
佐荣？
Chorong?

806
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,410
你是个粗鲁的混蛋
You're a rude bastard.

807
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,410
我以前是个武术运动员
I used to be a martial arts player.

808
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,410
如果你不想死，就走吧
If you don't want to die, just go.

809
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,410
别傻了

810
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,410
上车
Get in the car.

Let's go.

00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,410
我该怎么办？
What should I do?

813
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,410
我应该上台阶吗？
Should I step on the step?

814
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,410
别这么做！
Don't do it!

815
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,410
你不能打一个正常人！
You can't hit a normal person!

816
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,410
上车
Get in the car.

817
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,410
我好尴尬
I'm so embarrassed.

818
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,410
你会惹上麻烦的
You'll get in trouble.

819

我下手太重了
I hit him too hard.

820
00:38:58,850 --> 00:38:59,850
嘿！
Hey!

821
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,850

822
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,850
醒醒！
Wake up!

823
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,850
嘿！
Hey!

824

呼吸！
Breathe!

825
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:04,850
他没事吧？
Is he okay?

826
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,850
我去叫醒他
I'll wake him up.

827
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,850
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

828
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:16,810
他是真的白相浩吗？
Is he the real Baek Sang-ho?

829
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,810
是你吗？

830
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,810
他长得像我，但他是真人
He looks like me, but he's the real one.

831
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,810
我们应该早点来的

832
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:22,810
对不起
I'm sorry.

833
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,810
你经营二手车生意，还经营这个俱乐部？
So you run a used car business and run this club?

834
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,810
是的
Yes.

835
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,810
我听说棒球运动员经常来你经营的俱乐部

836
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,810
棒球运动员在那里卖毒品吗？

他可能周五会在俱乐部表演

850
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,810

If you don't go with him, you'll get stabbed again.

851
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,810

856
00:40:39,546 --> 00:40:41,546
处理掉
Get rid of it.

我现在联系不上他

很奇怪，不是吗？

1040
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:19,930
这些裤子是什么？

我从柜台借的

你的日本黑帮呢？
Where's your yakuza?

1050

00:59:32,362 --> 00:59:33,362
我会这么做的
I'll do it that way.

1167
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:37,362
不，你不能因为受伤就一直走
No, you can't keep moving because you're hurt.

1168
00:59:37,362 --> 00:59:39,362
他们杀了人
Hey, they killed a man.

1169
00:59:39,362 --> 00:59:40,362
我必须把他们都抓住
I have to catch them all.

1170
00:59:40,362 --> 00:59:43,362
我会把他们都抓起来，这样你就可以放松了
I'll catch them all, so you can relax.

1171
00:59:44,362 --> 00:59:45,362
你能做到吗？
Can you do that?

1172
00:59:45,362 --> 00:59:46,362
如果你等我，我就在那儿
I'll be there if you wait.

1173
00:59:46,362 --> 00:59:48,362
哦，我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1174
00:59:49,362 --> 00:59:50,362
嘿
Hey.

1175
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:51,362
什么事？
Yes?

1176
00:59:51,362 --> 00:59:53,362
我要去抓队长，打电话给孩子们，别让他们过来
I'm going to catch the team leader, so call the kids and keep them from coming.

1177
00:59:53,362 --> 00:59:54,362
是的，是的
Yes, yes.

1178
01:00:02,138 --> 01:00:03,338
好冷
Oh, it's cold.

1179
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:05,598
你找到药了吗？
Did you find the medicine?

1180
01:00:05,598 --> 01:00:06,638
你没有吧？
You didn't, right?

1181
01:00:06,638 --> 01:00:10,138
看到没，我说了我办公室里没有
See? I told you I didn't have it in my office.

1182
01:00:10,138 --> 01:00:12,238
我很抱歉这么说,
And I'm sorry to say this,

1183
01:00:12,238 --> 01:00:13,438
但当车里有人的时候,
but when there's someone in the car,

1184
01:00:13,438 --> 01:00:15,898
你得把窗户打开一点
you have to open the window a little.

1185
01:00:15,898 --> 01:00:18,298
否则就会窒息而死
Otherwise, it can be a suffocation.

1186
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:22,238
这个案子结束之前你是不会死的
Hey, you'll never die until this case is over.

1187
01:00:22,238 --> 01:00:26,298
嘿，有没有什么地方能找到药？
Hey, is there any place you can find the medicine?

1188
01:00:26,298 --> 01:00:30,762
你去过 Tomo 的伪装办公室吗？
Have you been to Tomo's disguise office?

1189
01:00:30,762 --> 01:00:31,822
喂，东姑
Hey, Dong-gu.

1190
01:00:31,822 --> 01:00:34,522
我发现了蓝队队长的尸体
I found the body of the chief of the Blue Team.

1191
01:00:34,522 --> 01:00:37,922
渔民在矿井的垃圾场找到的
The fishermen found it in the dump of the mine.

1192
01:00:37,922 --> 01:00:40,562
我认为他马上就杀了那个失踪的党员
I think he killed the missing party member right away.

1193
01:00:40,562 --> 01:00:48,682
但他被捕时还活著
But he was alive when he was arrested.

1194
01:00:48,682 --> 01:00:50,782
哇，疯狂的混蛋
Wow, crazy bastards.

1195
01:00:50,782 --> 01:00:53,782
他们甚至杀了警察
They even killed the police.

1196
01:00:53,782 --> 01:00:56,322
他们是疯子
They're crazy bastards.

1197
01:01:00,186 --> 01:01:01,186
你在哪里？
Where are you?

1198
01:01:01,186 --> 01:01:02,986
我在搜查 Tomo 的办公室
I'm searching Tomo's office.

1199
01:01:02,986 --> 01:01:04,186
找到杨
Find Yang.

1200
01:01:11,226 --> 01:01:13,226
你把它藏哪儿了？
Where did you hide it?

1201
01:01:40,122 --> 01:01:41,122
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

1202
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:49,034
你有枪吗？
Do you have a gun?

1203
01:01:49,034 --> 01:01:51,034
里奇？
Ricky?

1204
01:01:51,034 --> 01:01:54,362
你在找药吗？
Are you looking for a medicine?

1205
01:01:54,362 --> 01:01:57,362
你说什么呢？
What are you talking about?

1206
01:02:00,362 --> 01:02:02,362
如果你再靠近，我就杀了你
Hey, if you come close, I'll kill you.

1207
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:32,362
PikaHD.com
PikaHD.com

1208
01:02:59,034 --> 01:02:59,934
求你了
Please.

1209
01:03:01,134 --> 01:03:03,014
我收到了贺卡
I received the greeting card.

1210
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:07,298
我听说你在对你的朋友做坏事
I heard you're doing bad things to your friends.

1211
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:11,678
因为你拿出来的药，主席很不舒服
The chairman is very uncomfortable because of the medicine you took out.

1212
01:03:11,678 --> 01:03:13,238
你犯了个错误
You made a mistake.

1213
01:03:13,598 --> 01:03:15,498
我应该立刻杀了你
I should have killed you at once.

1214
01:03:15,498 --> 01:03:18,158
主席的错误在于我不能杀死他
The chairman's mistake was that I couldn't kill him.

1215
01:03:19,598 --> 01:03:21,862
对不起
I'm sorry.

1216
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:25,422
我不是故意的
I didn't mean to.

1217
01:03:26,882 --> 01:03:30,022
我帮你赚了很多钱
I've made you a lot of money.

1218
01:03:30,202 --> 01:03:31,742
我需要照顾好自己
I need to take care of myself.

1219
01:03:32,562 --> 01:03:34,062
或者你可以买下来
Or you can buy it.

1220
01:03:34,762 --> 01:03:36,482
我必须付出代价
I have to pay.

1221
01:03:37,842 --> 01:03:41,926
你麻烦大了
You're in a lot of trouble.

1222
01:03:43,226 --> 01:03:45,266
你在跟谁说话？
Who are you talking to?

1223
01:03:46,286 --> 01:03:48,826
你没钱
You don't have the money.

1224
01:03:49,466 --> 01:03:51,226
这药是主席的
The medicine is the chairman's.

1225
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:53,526
随便你
Do whatever you want.

1226
01:03:54,686 --> 01:03:56,526
让我们看看会发生什么
Let's see what happens.

1227
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:57,926
你说什么？
What did you say?

1228
01:03:59,046 --> 01:04:00,326
我很期待
I'm looking forward to it.

1229
01:04:31,226 --> 01:04:33,826
我觉得里奇接管了组织
I think Ricky took over the organization.

1230
01:04:34,526 --> 01:04:35,526
那药呢？
What about the medicine?

1231
01:04:36,726 --> 01:04:37,990
没有药
There's no medicine.

1232
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:40,890
他几小时后要和白总统谈判
He's dealing with President Baek in a few hours.

1233
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,990
我们该怎么办？
What should we do?

1234
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:47,798
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1235
01:04:48,898 --> 01:04:49,998
我们得见个面
We have to meet.

1236
01:05:10,266 --> 01:05:11,266
什么？
What?

1237
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,618
我会直接告诉你
I'll tell you directly.

1238
01:05:16,618 --> 01:05:17,786
让开
Move.

1239
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,082
你以为你能骗得了我吗？
You think you can fool me?

1240
01:05:23,082 --> 01:05:25,082
你以为你能骗得了我吗？
You think you can fool me?

1241
01:06:29,498 --> 01:06:31,498
我不再需要你了！
I don't need you anymore!

1242
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:57,970
主席要买我的药
The chairman is buying my medicine.

1243
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:05,662
- 怎么了?-这里是总务办公室
What is it? This is the general affairs office.

1244
01:07:06,202 --> 01:07:07,822
肯定有什么事
Something must be going on.

1245
01:07:08,982 --> 01:07:12,422
哦，谢谢我来自光苏大学
Oh, thank you. I'm from Gwangsu University.

1246
01:07:12,422 --> 01:07:15,462
- 那边怎么回事?-是个谋杀案
What's going on over there? It's a murder case.

1247
01:07:15,462 --> 01:07:17,222
受害者是一名警官
The victim is a police officer.

1248
01:07:17,222 --> 01:07:20,802
警察? 看看这个
Police? Look at this.

1249
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:24,122
李刚浩? 他是周成哲手下的警察
Lee Gang-ho? He was the police officer under Joo Sung-chul.

1250
01:07:24,122 --> 01:07:26,442
他用锤子把墙敲碎了
He broke the wall with a hammer.

1251
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:28,282
受害者一定是在找什么东西
The victim must have been looking for something.

1252
01:07:29,282 --> 01:07:31,082
他什么时候死的？
What time did he die?

1253
01:07:31,082 --> 01:07:32,582
凌晨两点左右
Around 2 a.m.

1254
01:07:35,002 --> 01:07:36,202
我们走吧
Let's go.

1255
01:07:36,202 --> 01:07:37,902
安静！
Be quiet!

1256
01:07:40,202 --> 01:07:42,402
那个混蛋
That bastard.

1257
01:07:43,002 --> 01:07:47,642
头儿，总部要开始内部调查了
Boss, the head office is going to start the internal investigation.

1258
01:07:47,642 --> 01:07:49,482
你们这些混蛋
You bastards.

1259
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,010
我们找到药就走吧
Let's find the medicine and leave.

1260
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:55,010
里奇肯定在找它
Ricky must be looking for it.

1261
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,650
你就这么放著不管吗？
Are you just going to leave it?

1262
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:58,250
杀了他
Just kill him.

1263
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,890
快点交出你的位置
Hurry up and give up your position here.

1264
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:02,450
你也应该完成你的工作
You should finish your work too.

1265
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:04,210
我为什么要辞职？
Why should I give up my position?

1266
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:05,050
我会负责的
I'll take responsibility.

1267
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:07,210
你不打我就揍你，你疯了吗？
I'll beat you up if you don't. Are you crazy?

1268
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:09,330
你疯了吗，混蛋？
Are you crazy, you bastard?

1269
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:11,650
朱成哲的队长在吗？
Is the head of Joo Sung-chul's team here?

1270
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,330
不，他不是，你可以走了
No, he's not. You can go.

1271
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:14,930
他说他不在
He said he's not here.

1272
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:16,050
他不在这里
He's not here.

1273
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,850
好吧，我下次再来
Okay, I'll come back next time.

1274
01:08:19,322 --> 01:08:20,922
你可以直接问他
You can just ask him.

1275
01:08:20,922 --> 01:08:22,402
问他什么？
Ask him what?

1276
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:23,402
等等
Wait.

1277
01:08:23,402 --> 01:08:25,802
你真烦人
You're so annoying.

1278
01:08:25,802 --> 01:08:26,722
什么？
What?

1279
01:08:26,722 --> 01:08:27,922
我问你点事
Let me ask you something.

1280
01:08:27,922 --> 01:08:28,602
没有
No.

1281
01:08:28,602 --> 01:08:31,482
为什么李江浩会在黎明的时候去总公司？
Why did Lee Kang-ho go to the head office at dawn?

1282
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,322
你可以等他来了再问他
You can ask him when he's here.

1283
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:35,202
我怎么知道? 他一定是去调查了
How would I know? He must have gone to investigate.

1284
01:08:35,202 --> 01:08:35,802
对
Right.

1285
01:08:35,802 --> 01:08:36,402
那时候？
At that time?

1286
01:08:36,402 --> 01:08:37,202
是的
Yes.

1287
01:08:37,202 --> 01:08:37,722
什么？
What?

1288
01:08:37,722 --> 01:08:38,802
他去拿药了吗？
Did he go to get the medicine?

1289
01:08:38,802 --> 01:08:39,402
没有
No.

1290
01:08:39,402 --> 01:08:40,402
你认识我吗？
Do you know me?

1291
01:08:40,402 --> 01:08:41,482
没有
No.

1292
01:08:41,482 --> 01:08:42,202
你认识我吗？
Do you know me?

1293
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:43,202
你不能说
You can't say it.

1294
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,082
你在总部
You're in the head office.

1295
01:08:45,082 --> 01:08:46,522
你不能说
You can't say it.

1296
01:08:46,642 --> 01:08:47,642
什么？
What?

1297
01:08:47,642 --> 01:08:49,042
你想干什么？
What do you want to do?

1298
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,442
等等
Wait.

1299
01:08:50,442 --> 01:08:53,762
如果你继续碰他，他会受伤的
If you keep touching him, he'll get hurt.

1300
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:57,722
你为什么要打扰别人的公司？
Why are you bothering someone else's company?

1301
01:08:57,722 --> 01:08:59,562
你会惹上麻烦的
You'll get in trouble.

1302
01:09:08,258 --> 01:09:11,138
我想我会再见到你的，别放松
I think I'll see you again. Don't relax.

1303
01:09:14,138 --> 01:09:16,338
如果你再发一次誓，我就杀了你
If you swear one more time, I'll kill you.

1304
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:20,810
照个 X 光
Take an X-ray.

1305
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:21,810
你的手
Your hand.

1306
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:28,210
嘿
Hey.

1307
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:30,290
是不是很奇怪？
Isn't it weird?

1308
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:31,610
他们怎么了？
What's wrong with them?

1309
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:32,610
对
Right.

1310
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:38,890
但是在没有证据的情况下使用新闻不是很奇怪吗？
But isn't it weird to use the news without evidence?

1311
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:41,130
我们得找到确凿的证据
We need to find something for sure.

1312
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:43,370
等等
Wait.

1313
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:47,970
有个富家子弟以前经营的游艇生意
There's a yacht business that rich kids used to run.

1314
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:48,890
没有
No.

1315
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:50,090
关门了
It's closed.

1316
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:50,730
没有
No.

1317
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:52,770
我们去那里
Let's go there.

1318
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:53,370
走？
Go?

1319
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:54,130
好吧
Okay.

1320
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:55,370
我把地址给你
I'll give you the address.

1321
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:56,610
干得好
Good job.

1322
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:59,050
继续这样想
Keep thinking like that.

1323
01:09:59,050 --> 01:09:59,890
我知道了
I got it.

1324
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:00,410
干得好
Good job.

1325
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:00,890
我们走吧
Let's go.

1326
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:01,730
好吧
Okay.

1327
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:02,490
我去叫导游
I'll call the guide.

1328
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:03,210
好吧
Okay.

1329
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:04,410
怎么了，坐直了
What's okay? Sit straight.

1330
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:05,810
好吧
Okay.

1331
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:08,250
我希望他们晚点再打开窗户
I hope they open the window later.

1332
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:14,970
我觉得还在施工中
I think it's under construction.

1333
01:10:34,714 --> 01:10:35,714
嘿！
Hey!

1334
01:10:36,814 --> 01:10:38,214
你是谁？
Who are you?

1335
01:10:38,994 --> 01:10:41,354
回家吧，我不干
Go home. I'm not doing it.

1336
01:10:42,914 --> 01:10:43,914
出去
Get out.

1337
01:10:44,214 --> 01:10:45,514
我们得进去，我们得报警
We have to go in. We have to call the police.

1338
01:10:45,514 --> 01:10:46,514
滚出去！
Get out!

1339
01:10:49,414 --> 01:10:51,054
嘿! 别这样！
Hey! Don't do it!

1340
01:11:20,346 --> 01:11:23,466
车里的人是你，对吧？
It was you in the car, right?

1341
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:35,050
什么? 已经结束了？
What? It's already over?

1342
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:36,050
紧急情况！
Emergency!

1343
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:39,050
给我
Give it to me.

1344
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:40,050
躺下
Lie down.

1345
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:42,050
嘿，翻译
Hey, interpreter.

1346
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:45,050
你为什么在这里？
Why are you here?

1347
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,050
你不能来这里
You can't come here.

1348
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:50,794
我们是来找解药的
We're here to find a cure.

1349
01:11:51,794 --> 01:11:53,794
我们是来找解药的
We're here to find a cure.

1350
01:11:53,794 --> 01:11:55,794
你应该用敬语说
You should say it in honorifics.

1351
01:11:55,794 --> 01:11:56,794
我们是来找解药的
We're here to find a cure.

1352
01:11:56,794 --> 01:11:58,794
你是来找解药的，对吧？
You're here to find a cure, right?

1353
01:11:58,794 --> 01:11:59,794
药呢？
Where's the medicine?

1354
01:11:59,794 --> 01:12:01,794
医生是谁？
Who's the doctor?

1355
01:12:02,794 --> 01:12:03,866
我不知道
I don't know.

1356
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:05,866
你不知道？
You don't know?

1357
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:07,866
如果你撒谎，你会死的
You'll die if you lie.

1358
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:09,866
药呢？
Where's the medicine?

1359
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:11,866
你从哪儿弄来的？
Where did you get it?

1360
01:12:11,866 --> 01:12:12,866
你从哪儿弄来的？
Where did you get it?

1361
01:12:13,866 --> 01:12:14,866
我真的不知道
I really don't know.

1362
01:12:15,866 --> 01:12:16,866
我们正在找
We're looking for it.

1363
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:18,866
他真的不知道
He really doesn't know.

1364
01:12:18,866 --> 01:12:19,866
我们也在找
We're looking for it, too.

1365
01:12:23,866 --> 01:12:25,834
东鼓
Dong-gu.

1366
01:12:25,834 --> 01:12:27,834
把他们都放进去，保证他们的安全
Put them all in and keep them safe.

1367
01:12:27,834 --> 01:12:28,834
好的，先生
All right, sir.

1368
01:12:28,834 --> 01:12:30,834
把 Kim Yang-ho 也带进来
Put Kim Yang-ho in, too.

1369
01:12:30,834 --> 01:12:31,834
过来
Come here.

1370
01:12:31,834 --> 01:12:32,834
就这一次
Just this once.

1371
01:12:35,834 --> 01:12:37,834
他们为什么要造游艇？
Why are they doing a yacht?

1372
01:12:39,834 --> 01:12:40,834
这些是什么？
What's all this?

1373
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:41,834
为什么有这么多钥匙？
Why are there so many keys?

1374
01:12:41,834 --> 01:12:42,834
什么口信？
What's the message?

1375
01:12:43,834 --> 01:12:44,834
太多了
There are so many.

1376
01:12:44,834 --> 01:12:45,834
是游艇钥匙吗？
Is it a yacht key?

1377
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:47,834
为什么只有这一张卡？
Why is this the only card?

1378
01:12:49,834 --> 01:12:51,834
这不是日本黑帮的作案模式吗？
Isn't this the Yakuza pattern?

1379
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:52,834
露西？
Lucy?

1380
01:12:54,834 --> 01:12:57,410
露西
Lucy.

1381
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:14,690
搜查这个地方
Search the place.

1382
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:15,690
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1383
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:19,562
他把药藏在哪儿了？
Where did he hide the medicine?

1384
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:21,562
仔细看
Look carefully.

1385
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:39,150
这是什么？
What is it?

1386
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:41,570
我不知道这是什么，但是锁得很紧
I don't know what this is, but it's locked tight.

1387
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:43,210
我觉得这下面有东西
I think there's something down here.

1388
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:43,710
是的
Yeah.

1389
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:44,210
打开看看
Open it.

1390
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:44,710
是的
Yes.

1391
01:13:47,626 --> 01:13:49,126
我觉得你应该这么做
I think you should do it.

1392
01:14:01,402 --> 01:14:03,402
这是什么？
Wow, what is this?

1393
01:14:06,778 --> 01:14:07,778
这是录音室里用过的一个按钮
It's a button that was used in the studio.

1394
01:14:07,778 --> 01:14:09,778
所以我才找不到
That's why I can't find it.

1395
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,778
哇，太棒了
Wow, that's amazing.

1396
01:14:16,762 --> 01:14:19,762
我想我拍了一张成分组合的照片
I think I took a picture of the combination of the ingredients.

1397
01:14:30,714 --> 01:14:31,714
你来吧
You do it

1398
01:14:31,714 --> 01:14:32,814
就当是为了我
You do it for me

1399
01:14:32,814 --> 01:14:34,414
我可以用我的力量
I can use my strength

1400
01:14:35,094 --> 01:14:36,094
哦，天啊
Oh, man

1401
01:14:38,562 --> 01:14:40,142
嘿，这是个保险箱
Hey, this is a safe

1402
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,522
你的力气怎么打得开？
How can you open it with your strength?

1403
01:14:41,522 --> 01:14:42,662
你得动动脑子
You have to use your brain

1404
01:14:43,202 --> 01:14:43,702
用我的大脑？
Use my brain?

1405
01:14:43,702 --> 01:14:44,702
我怎么能..
How can I...

1406
01:14:51,546 --> 01:14:53,990
没错
That's right.

1407
01:15:03,514 --> 01:15:05,514
我是说，你说里面是空的
I mean, you said it was empty.

1408
01:15:05,514 --> 01:15:07,650
哦，我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1409
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:09,650
门没开
It's not open.

1410
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:12,586
门开著
Oh, it's open.

1411
01:15:12,586 --> 01:15:14,586
门开著
It's open.

1412
01:15:14,586 --> 01:15:16,586
我弄坏了
I broke it.

1413
01:15:16,586 --> 01:15:18,586
这是什么？
What's this?

1414
01:15:18,586 --> 01:15:20,806
只有一个按钮
There's only a button.

1415
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:25,410
跟我来
Follow me

1416
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:26,410
什么？
What?

1417
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:29,230
下面有什么？
What's down there?

1418
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:30,230
为什么？
Why?

1419
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:31,230
这是什么？
What's this?

1420
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,230
有东西！
There's something!

1421
01:15:42,234 --> 01:15:43,234
葡萄！
Grapes!

1422
01:15:43,874 --> 01:15:46,898
我找到了
I found it

1423
01:15:57,498 --> 01:15:59,498
我找到里奇了
I found Ricky.

1424
01:15:59,498 --> 01:16:00,498
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

1425
01:16:00,498 --> 01:16:03,498
我肯定跟踪了你放出来的那个日本黑帮混蛋
I'm sure I followed the Yakuza bastard you released.

1426
01:16:04,498 --> 01:16:05,498
那孩子们呢？
What about the kids?

1427
01:16:06,498 --> 01:16:07,498
他们都在这里
They're all here.

1428
01:16:08,498 --> 01:16:10,498
我还带了一把没有注册的枪
I also brought a gun that wasn't registered.

1429
01:16:10,498 --> 01:16:11,498
准备好
Get ready.

1430
01:16:11,498 --> 01:16:12,498
是的
Yes.

1431
01:16:18,522 --> 01:16:20,222
因为这个
Because of this.

1432
01:16:20,222 --> 01:16:22,482
我们找到药了，现在怎么办？
We found the medicine. What do we do now?

1433
01:16:22,482 --> 01:16:24,182
Chorong 叫你去卖大白鲨，对吧？
Chorong told you to sell white shark, right?

1434
01:16:24,182 --> 01:16:25,322
是的
Yes.

1435
01:16:25,322 --> 01:16:26,682
去那里
Go there.

1436
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:29,282
朱成哲会有反应的
Ju Sungcheol will react.

1437
01:16:30,222 --> 01:16:31,482
这连一万韩元都不到，对吧？
This is not even 10,000 won, right?

1438
01:16:31,482 --> 01:16:32,822
是的，没错
Yes, it is.

1439
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:34,122
我们签合同吧
Let's sign the contract.

1440
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:36,922
但是这辆车和图片上的不一样
But the car is different from the picture.

1441
01:16:36,922 --> 01:16:38,282
你不信吗？
You're not buying it?

1442
01:16:38,282 --> 01:16:40,382
我一直在给你看车，直到现在
I've been showing you the car until now.

1443
01:16:40,382 --> 01:16:42,722
开什么玩笑？
Are you kidding me?

1444
01:16:42,722 --> 01:16:44,982
这和照片有什么区别？
What's the difference with the picture?

1445
01:16:44,982 --> 01:16:47,482
算了，快点把合同拿来
Forget it. Hurry up and bring the contract.

1446
01:16:47,582 --> 01:16:48,582
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1447
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:53,218
佐荣晚上也很努力工作
Chorong works hard at night, too.

1448
01:16:53,218 --> 01:16:55,358
你在干什么? 你要卖车吗？
What are you doing? Are you selling the car?

1449
01:16:55,358 --> 01:16:57,458
- 这是什么?-还在那儿
What's this? It's still there.

1450
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:58,618
是潜水车吗？
Is it a submerged car?

1451
01:16:58,618 --> 01:17:00,258
潜水车？
Submerged car?

1452
01:17:00,258 --> 01:17:01,418
是潜水车吗？
Is it a submerged car?

1453
01:17:01,418 --> 01:17:03,198
这是一辆潜水车
It's a submerged car.

1454
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:04,818
这能行吗？
Can this work?

1455
01:17:04,818 --> 01:17:07,018
是的，这是一辆被水淹没的车
Yes, it's a submerged car.

1456
01:17:07,018 --> 01:17:08,858
是你开的，对吧？
You drove it, right?

1457
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:09,858
是的，没错
Yes, that's right.

1458
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,718
不是这辆车
It wasn't this car.

1459
01:17:11,718 --> 01:17:13,698
你让我买的
You told me to buy it.

1460
01:17:13,698 --> 01:17:14,558
你为什么要这么做？
Why did you do that?

1461
01:17:14,558 --> 01:17:16,498
没有，长官，我什么时候这么做了？
No, sir. When did I do that?

1462
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:17,618
不久前
A while ago.

1463
01:17:17,678 --> 01:17:20,418
这个多少钱？
How much is this?

1464
01:17:20,418 --> 01:17:21,118
3000韩元
3,000 won.

1465
01:17:21,118 --> 01:17:22,418
3000韩元？
3,000 won?

1466
01:17:22,418 --> 01:17:23,778
3000韩元太便宜了
3,000 won is too cheap.

1467
01:17:23,778 --> 01:17:26,658
引擎没问题，你应该能拿到3000韩元
The engine is clean. You should get 3,000 won.

1468
01:17:26,658 --> 01:17:27,858
是的，先生
That's right, sir.

1469
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,178
给我3000韩元
Give me 3,000 won.

1470
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:31,658
什么，多少钱？
What? How much?

1471
01:17:31,658 --> 01:17:32,658
3000韩元
3,000 won.

1472
01:17:32,658 --> 01:17:33,318
3000韩元？
3,000 won?

1473
01:17:33,318 --> 01:17:34,378
是的，3000韩元
Yes, 3,000 won.

1474
01:17:35,258 --> 01:17:36,718
亲爱的，我能工作吗？
Honey, can I work?

1475
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:39,378
我在废品站拿到了150韩元
I get 150 won at the scrapyard.

1476
01:17:39,378 --> 01:17:39,958
谢谢你
Thank you.

1477
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:40,978
再见
Bye.

1478
01:17:44,322 --> 01:17:45,682
他不是我们要找的匪徒
He's not our gangster.

1479
01:17:45,682 --> 01:17:47,162
他是黑帮的
He's the gangster.

1480
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,222
那个混蛋
That bastard.

1481
01:17:48,222 --> 01:17:48,822
请进
Come in.

1482
01:17:48,822 --> 01:17:49,682
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1483
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,550
你难道不好奇
Aren't you curious who worked on

1484
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:55,510
死去的大白鲨？
the dead white shark?

1485
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,070
你为什么要给我看？
Why are you showing me?

1486
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:58,050
真烦人
It's annoying.

1487
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:00,150
我很生气，别给我看
I'm getting angry. Don't show me.

1488
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:00,750
真烦人
It's annoying.

1489
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,350
我看得越多，就越生气
The more I see it, the more I get angry.

1490
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,250
等等
Wait.

1491
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:06,450
你为什么给我看这个？
Why are you showing me this?

1492
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:09,970
你不想抓住罪犯吗？
Don't you want to catch the criminal?

1493
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:10,750
是的
I do.

1494
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:11,350
对吧？
Right?

1495
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:11,770
是的
Yes.

1496
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,910
但你能抓住他
But you can catch him.

1497
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:14,950
我？
Me?

1498
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:17,210
我们合作吧
Let's work together.

1499
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:33,130
摆脱他，然后离开
Get rid of him and leave.

1500
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:34,130
是的
Yes.

1501
01:18:49,978 --> 01:18:50,978
喂？
Hello?

1502
01:18:50,978 --> 01:18:54,498
你还记得我吗? 我是后街男孩的 Chorong
Do you remember me? I'm Chorong from the Backstreet Boys.

1503
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:57,498
喂？
Hello?

1504
01:19:00,594 --> 01:19:01,594
什么？
What?

1505
01:19:03,082 --> 01:19:09,082
我只是碰巧手里有20公斤的超能力
I just happened to have a 20kg hyper in my hand.

1506
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:11,082
这是给棒球运动员的，对吧？
This is for the baseball players, right?

1507
01:19:19,386 --> 01:19:20,386
喂？
Hello?

1508
01:19:21,886 --> 01:19:23,566
那又怎样？
So?

1509
01:19:24,066 --> 01:19:24,566
什么？
What?

1510
01:19:24,566 --> 01:19:25,566
什么？
What?

1511
01:19:30,218 --> 01:19:31,218
我挂了
I hung up.

1512
01:19:31,218 --> 01:19:32,718
你是只狐貍
You're a fox.

1513
01:19:33,218 --> 01:19:34,718
把照片发给我
Send me the picture.

1514
01:19:59,482 --> 01:20:00,482
喂？
Hello?

1515
01:20:01,322 --> 01:20:04,058
情况怎么样？
What about the condition?

1516
01:20:04,058 --> 01:20:05,058
什么？
What?

1517
01:20:06,178 --> 01:20:08,178
好吧..
Well...

1518
01:20:12,018 --> 01:20:13,122
毒品交易
The drug deal...

1519
01:20:13,462 --> 01:20:15,462
我们做到了，对吧？
We did it, right?

1520
01:20:16,002 --> 01:20:18,502
我们再来一次
We'll do it again

1521
01:20:19,322 --> 01:20:21,122
即使我们卖了它
Even if we sell it

1522
01:20:21,622 --> 01:20:24,202
队长会收到的，因为这是谣言
the team leader will get it because it's a rumor

1523
01:20:25,542 --> 01:20:27,162
如果你交出毒品交易
If you hand over the drug deal

1524
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,082
我们会还给你的
we'll return it to you

1525
01:20:31,082 --> 01:20:34,466
我把地址给你
I'll give you the address

1526
01:20:34,466 --> 01:20:36,466
一小时后你一个人来
You come alone after an hour

1527
01:20:37,726 --> 01:20:39,566
好吧
Okay

1528
01:20:39,566 --> 01:20:40,566
好吧
Okay

1529
01:20:40,566 --> 01:20:41,566
等一下
Wait a minute

1530
01:20:41,566 --> 01:20:43,566
毒品交易是你给我的吗？
Was it you who gave me the drug deal?

1531
01:20:43,566 --> 01:20:44,566
嘿
Hey

1532
01:20:44,566 --> 01:20:46,066
从现在开始，你要乖乖的
You have to be good from now on

1533
01:20:46,066 --> 01:20:47,566
是啊，你得好好表现
Yeah, you have to be good

1534
01:20:47,566 --> 01:20:48,566
你这个混蛋
You bastard

1535
01:20:48,566 --> 01:20:49,566
但他让我一个人来
But he told me to come alone

1536
01:20:49,566 --> 01:20:50,566
我一个人去吗？
Am I going alone?

1537
01:20:50,566 --> 01:20:51,566
你必须一个人去
You have to go alone

1538
01:20:52,566 --> 01:20:53,566
那我就不去了
Then I'm not going

1539
01:20:57,426 --> 01:20:59,106
泰秀
Tae Soo

1540
01:20:59,106 --> 01:21:00,106
我找到罪犯了
I found the criminal

1541
01:21:00,106 --> 01:21:01,606
我要当场抓住他
I'm going to catch him on the spot

1542
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:03,606
你能跟他们一起走吗？
Can you move with the guys?

1543
01:21:03,606 --> 01:21:04,606
好的，我马上过去
Yeah, I'll be right there

1544
01:21:04,606 --> 01:21:05,606
你在哪里？
Where are you?

1545
01:21:05,606 --> 01:21:06,606
我把地址给你
I'll give you the address

1546
01:21:07,606 --> 01:21:08,606
你打算怎么办？
What are you going to do?

1547
01:21:09,606 --> 01:21:13,214
我要改变计划
I'm going to change my plan

1548
01:21:27,610 --> 01:21:29,610
你这个混蛋！
You're a bastard!

1549
01:21:35,026 --> 01:21:37,026
你想找到药，对吧？
You want to find the medicine, right?

1550
01:21:37,026 --> 01:21:39,026
你就是要杀他的人，对吧？
You're the one who's going to kill him, right?

1551
01:21:39,026 --> 01:21:41,026
你才是坏人
You're the bad guy.

1552
01:21:43,386 --> 01:21:45,386
我们做个交易吧
Let's make a deal.

1553
01:21:45,386 --> 01:21:47,386
我知道药在哪里
I know where the medicine is.

1554
01:21:49,386 --> 01:21:53,346
怎么会这样？
How did this happen?

1555
01:21:53,346 --> 01:21:55,346
你在想什么？
Hey, what are you thinking?

1556
01:21:55,346 --> 01:21:57,346
Chorong，你可以的
Chorong, Chorong, you can do it.

1557
01:21:57,346 --> 01:21:59,346
别紧张
Don't be nervous.

1558
01:21:59,346 --> 01:22:01,346
我真的要一个人去
I'm really going alone.

1559
01:22:01,346 --> 01:22:03,346
不用担心你
Don't worry about you.

1560
01:22:03,346 --> 01:22:05,346
把袋子送好
Just deliver the bag well.

1561
01:22:05,346 --> 01:22:07,346
我们要把它掩盖起来
We're going to cover it up.

1562
01:22:07,346 --> 01:22:09,346
如果朱成哲开枪呢？
What if Joo Sung-chul shoots a gun?

1563
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:11,346
你必须避免
You have to avoid it.

1564
01:22:11,346 --> 01:22:13,346
上车
Get in.

1565
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:15,750
妈的
Fuck.

1566
01:22:25,178 --> 01:22:27,178
操
Ah, f**k.

1567
01:22:44,282 --> 01:22:46,282
是的，我们到了
Yes, we're here.

1568
01:22:46,282 --> 01:22:48,282
到三楼来
Come up to the third floor.

1569
01:22:48,282 --> 01:22:50,282
是的
Yes.

1570
01:22:56,634 --> 01:22:57,694
我们准备一下
Let's get ready.

1571
01:23:29,178 --> 01:23:31,078
队长，是我 Cho Rung
Team leader, it's me, Cho Rung.

1572
01:23:32,658 --> 01:23:34,318
队长
Team leader.

1573
01:23:41,306 --> 01:23:42,306
我真他妈的生气！
I'm so fucking pissed off!

1574
01:23:42,306 --> 01:23:43,306
大哥！
Hyung-nim!

1575
01:23:52,034 --> 01:23:53,034
救救我！
Please save me!

1576
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:01,090
你不是 Antoquin 吧？
You're not Antoquin, are you?

1577
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:04,090
啊，这个朱成哲，那个狗娘养的
Ah, this Ju Sung-chul, that son of a bitch.

1578
01:24:09,642 --> 01:24:10,642
你个狗娘养的！
You son of a bitch!

1579
01:24:10,642 --> 01:24:11,642
你个狗娘养的！
You son of a bitch!

1580
01:24:13,642 --> 01:24:18,826
他怎么还不出来，我好担心
Why isn't he coming out? I'm so anxious.

1581
01:24:19,826 --> 01:24:20,826
我们要进去吗？
Should we go in?

1582
01:24:20,826 --> 01:24:21,826
我觉得我们应该
I think we should.

1583
01:24:23,826 --> 01:24:25,058
打开看看
Open it.

1584
01:24:28,226 --> 01:24:31,058
是盐
It's salt.

1585
01:24:32,058 --> 01:24:33,058
我完蛋了
I'm fucked.

1586
01:24:42,482 --> 01:24:43,482
药呢？
Where's the medicine?

1587
01:24:46,482 --> 01:24:48,482
我不懂日语，请救救我
I don't know Japanese. Please save me.

1588
01:24:48,482 --> 01:24:49,482
药呢？
Where's the medicine?

1589
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:53,490
警察知道了，我什么都不知道
The police know. I don't know anything.

1590
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,490
狗娘养的！
Son of a bitch!

1591
01:24:57,490 --> 01:25:00,042
他为什么不接电话，发生什么事了吗？
Why isn't he answering his phone? Did something happen?

1592
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:02,042
我们要上去吗？
Should we go up?

1593
01:25:03,042 --> 01:25:04,042
药在这里，对吧？
The medicine's here, right?

1594
01:25:19,866 --> 01:25:25,026
那个狗娘养的，那个狗娘养的，他在耍我
That son of a bitch, that son of a bitch, he's messing with me.

1595
01:25:25,026 --> 01:25:28,946
瑞琪，这地方很危险，我们换个地方吧
Riki, this place is dangerous. Let's move to another place.

1596
01:25:28,946 --> 01:25:30,146

嘿，跟教授说说这个

你现在在哪，混蛋？

我要吃药

你是个暗箭伤人的人

你无处可逃了
There's nowhere to run.

1637
01:29:19,314 --> 01:29:21,122
我要杀了你

Seok-joo! Seok-joo！
Seok-joo! Seok-joo!

1646
01:30:51,018 --> 01:30:52,018
你在干什么？

米奇呢，你抓到他了吗？

晚点回来
Come back late.

1652
01:30:58,518 --> 01:31:00,518
因为你在找他，所以监控摄像头都坏了
The security cameras are all dead because you're looking for him.

1653
01:31:01,118 --> 01:31:03,618
我们得在他逃跑之前抓住他
Hey, we have to catch this guy before he runs away.

1654
01:31:04,018 --> 01:31:05,518
请帮我拿一下
Please hold this for a second.

1655
01:31:05,518 --> 01:31:06,518
这是什么？
What is it?

1656
01:31:06,518 --> 01:31:07,518
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

1657
01:31:08,518 --> 01:31:09,518

检查你的护照

1663
01:31:19,018 --> 01:31:20,018
飞船准备好了吗？

1664
01:31:20,018 --> 01:31:21,018
是的
Yes.

1665
01:31:21,018 --> 01:31:23,018
我们只需要去南非然后离开
We just have to go to South Africa and leave.

1666
01:31:23,018 --> 01:31:25,018
我觉得时机正好

1667
01:31:25,018 --> 01:31:27,018
船长要我们明早过去

1668
01:31:29,018 --> 01:31:31,538
如果你想见我，告诉他来中国
If you want to meet me, tell him to come to China.

1669
01:32:08,154 --> 01:32:09,154
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1670
01:32:09,154 --> 01:32:11,930
嘿! 你这个混蛋！
Hey! You bastard!

1671
01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:13,930

01:32:24,826 --> 01:32:25,826
别过来！
Don't come!

1676
01:32:26,826 --> 01:32:28,826
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1677
01:32:29,826 --> 01:32:30,826
放开我！
Let me go!

1678
01:32:31,826 --> 01:32:32,826

我是光洙家的人

1683
01:32:41,826 --> 01:32:42,826
我也是警察！
I'm a police too!

1684
01:33:04,634 --> 01:33:05,934
你找到他了吗？
Did you track him down?

1685
01:33:05,934 --> 01:33:06,934
他在逃跑吗？
Is he running away?

1686
01:33:06,934 --> 01:33:07,934
谁在逃跑？
Who's running away?

1687

他在等你

你觉得警察能杀人吗？

如果你努力工作，你可以杀死一个人

你不能按法律说的做

1693

你个狗娘养的！

与此同时，把钱带给黑帮的人现在被证明是个侦探，这太令人震惊了
Meanwhile, the person who brought the money to the yakuza is now proven to be a detective, which is shocking.
