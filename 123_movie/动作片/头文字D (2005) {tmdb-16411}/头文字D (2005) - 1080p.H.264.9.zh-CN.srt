1
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,842
When will be our next race, Ryousuke?

2
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,111
When you beat all the downhill racers
in Gumma

3
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,240
then I'll race you

4
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:33,350
Off-road?

5
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,753
Downhill

6
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,484
All the downhill roads in Japan

7
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,587
Starting tomorrow, you start
from the South, I the North

8
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,864
We'll compete with different
downhill racers

9
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,329
Let's see who ends up winning more, OK?

10
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,596
You not gonna race in the tracks?

11
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,102
The tracks?

12
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,039
Downhill roads are much more fun

13
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,781
I'm back

14
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,963
What's wrong?

15
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,215
Honey¡­

16
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,325
Help me change my underpants

17
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,891
Son of a bitch, why did you change
my under wear?

18
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,190
Where're you going?

19
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,688
Off to school

20
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,763
School? Isn't it your summer vacation?

21
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,564
You're always out.
Are you a rent boy now?

22
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,133
Lingerie?

23
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,780
You know what's a god?

24
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,943
A god was once human

25
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,319
But he could do
what other humans could not

26
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,785
That's why he became a god

27
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,827
A year ago, that bitch of a principal
expelled me

28
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,027
She said, Itsuki, why don't you¡­

29
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,171
call yourself `Eat Shit' instead?

30
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,229
Then it hit me

31
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,408
I have to tell the world

32
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,540
Itsuki's not a piece of shit

33
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,174
I'll be a racer

34
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:07,277
Within a year, I've become the racing
god of Mt Akina

35
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,814
The boss of the Speed stars race team

36
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,716
But you didn't get your license
until last year

37
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,325
That's what we called talents

38
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,362
It's simple, just like drifting. How?

39
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,195
Pull the handbrake at a turn
to swing the car sideways

40
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,495
How's that? Cool

41
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,134
Won't it¡­ slow the car down?

42
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,534
How'd you drift then?

43
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,532
Floor the gas pedal

44
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,634
Don't slow for the curve

45
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:36,839
Then¡­

46
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,077
Then you and your car fly off the cliff

47
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,685
I don't blame you.
We got our licenses together

48
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,552
Yet you still haven't touched the wheel

49
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,659
Why don't you join my team?

50
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,717
I don't have a car

51
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,591
Don't worry, you can wash mine

52
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,327
I drive, you wash.
What a promising career

53
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,403
Come on, bro. Cheers

54
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,435
Milk. What¡¯s so good about it?

55
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,871
Lots of calcium and protein

56
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,000
Also good for your eyes

57
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,238
A good racer needs good eyes

58
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,578
Wanna go to a movie later?

59
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,717
Can't. I got my part-time job

60
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,862
Had an eyeful?

61
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,266
Natsuki from Class 2B

62
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,798
In white today

63
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:36,872
Having fun?

64
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,603
Why so nervous?
You guys are close, huh?

65
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:40,810
Not at all

66
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,780
No? I heard that you had a fight over her¡­

67
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,850
with Bulldog from the neighboring class

68
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,286
Time for work

69
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,791
Right, time for my allowance too

70
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,189
Were those your classmates?

71
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:02,865
Yes

72
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,832
They look like punks. Street racers?

73
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:10,440
No, they work at the gas station
After school

74
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,639
They work hard
but earn only 100Kyen a month

75
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,010
I bet you've spent all the cash
I gave you last time

76
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,148
Thanks for taking care of me
and my mom

77
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,053
But that's too much

78
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,422
Take it. You deserve it

79
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,530
What kind of dad are you?

80
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,897
I only ask you for a million yen and
you say no?

81
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:16,306
I'm worried you'll be in solitude
during your last years

82
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,932
I'm sure my last years will be just fine

83
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,236
How so?

84
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,439
What if I leave you
after I become a world champ?

85
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,843
I still have my gas station

86
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,982
Cashier, Boss

87
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,787
After you die,
It will be mine anyway. Get it?

88
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,021
Okay, consider that an advance
from my pay

89
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,252
An advance?

90
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,429
Excluding the money I spent raising you

91
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,496
you have already borrowed 8,635,000 yen

92
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,467
An advance? What have you done,
Mr. World Champ?

93
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,942
I have no idea

94
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,576
Welcome, Sir.
Which gas would you prefer?

95
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,115
Does the racing god of MtAkina
own this station?

96
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,352
Sorry, but I don't know

97
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,887
Look, this is what a car should be

98
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,592
Great body kit, alloy rims.
Wow, sports wheel

99
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,600
What's the price tag on this?

100
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,505
Are you the racing god of MtAkina?

101
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,068
It's actually me

102
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,808
But I was told he's the owner here

103
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,680
Yes, I'll be the owner in a few years
when he dies

104
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,749
You hit your own son.
Beware of divine intervention

105
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,254
We're the Night Kids Team from Myogi

106
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,517
My name is Nakazato

107
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,456
I'd like to race the racing god of MtAkina

108
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,325
There's no racing god in MtAkina

109
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,055
If you're looking for God

110
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,896
there's a temple over there

111
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,305
Anyway, I'll be waiting for you
at MtAkina to night

112
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,175
Wash the car.
We'll go up to MtAkina tonight

113
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,955
How many races have you won?

114
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,028
How¡¯ bout you?

115
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,264
Same here

116
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,034
Who you racin' tonight?

117
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,569
How 'bout we go for a race first?

118
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,736
So crowded. You sure you can manage?

119
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,043
Take it easy. I'll give my best

120
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,250
I have to be home¡­at 3

121
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,185
You know my dad

122
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,622
Don't worry

123
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,788
What? Still nervous?

124
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,188
Look, so many people¡­

125
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,411
Hurry up.
I need to give my assistant a ride home

126
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,273
You gonna take him with you in the race?

127
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,474
Is that for bidden?

128
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,548
Looks like this guy knows nothing at all

129
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,053
Well, in that case, I better sit with you

130
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:56,326
You guys are gay or what? I better leave

131
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:00,454
Fatty, we'll start from here.
The first one who¡­

132
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,928
gets to the parking lot wins

133
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,268
Bullshit. Of course the faster wins

134
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,884
Five

135
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,285
Four

136
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,192
Three

137
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:31,954
Two

138
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,227
He's a real amateur

139
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,333
We'll see at the first corner

140
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,655
The car behind is kissing ours

141
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,664
This guy is clueless

142
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,034
What you gonna do?

143
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,468
Just stay calm

144
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,072
Let's overtake him. It's safer

145
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,740
That's not necessary

146
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,810
Watch out ahead.   What?

147
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,383
Ahead

148
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,853
Look what you've done.
Told you to stay calm

149
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,391
It's all because of you wouldn't stay calm

150
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,599
See, I told you
I would take you home on time

151
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,863
Bastard

152
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,333
What do you mean?

153
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,467
You're the bastard
who puke right after you got out

154
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,783
Looks like it's 'bout time
we have a race here

155
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,483
It's not the right time yet

156
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,412
Why?

157
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,020
You wanna hear the truth?

158
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:06,488
Go ahead

159
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,859
I noticed something
while I was in your car

160
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,988
You're not smooth each time
you attacked a corner

161
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,265
Although your GTR has big horse power

162
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,962
but the engine is heavy

163
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,174
There're so many corners in MtAkina

164
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,641
Your car was under steered at every turn

165
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,670
Especially the 5 consecutive hairpins

166
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,742
You couldn't cut to the best lane
every time

167
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,753
Unless you can overcome this

168
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,947
you stand no chance with my FC

169
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,126
Unless you can overcome this

170
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:49,266
you stand no chance with my FC

171
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,872
So glad you're safe

172
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,550
You have to be safe
in order to be a world champ

173
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,776
I wanna buy a GTR

174
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,352
I'll get you a Mercedes instead

175
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,251
I wanna buy a GTR

176
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:51,981
And a Rolex

177
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:52,920
I wanna buy a GTR

178
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,993
But you almost killed yourself last night

179
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,458
It wouldn't happen
if I were driving a GTR

180
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,564
If you were driving a GTR,
you would have died

181
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,029
I wanna buy a GTR

182
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,305
How could I help you?

183
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:11,432
You can't help me,
I'm here for the fatty racing god

184
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,440
Racing god?

185
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,478
What you up to? Trying to put me down?

186
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,580
I lost to an AE86 last night

187
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,273
He dashed around the corner
with Inertia Drift

188
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,678
I could only catch the tofu shop label on it

189
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,062
You know him?

190
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,133
If you do, just tell him that

191
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,434
I'll be waiting for him
on MtAkina Saturday night

192
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,351
Takumi?

193
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,552
It got nothing to do with me

194
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,017
I was here last night

195
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:06,995
Whoever beat him last night
is the real racing god

196
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,224
Don't tell me that was you

197
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,131
It's¡­my old pal Banta

198
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,523
What? Say it again

199
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,595
I know it sounds incredible

200
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,326
Like I'm standing here looking at you

201
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:46,101
But the guy with the GTR did say
you beat him

202
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,570
GTR? Is it very powerful?

203
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,538
350 horse power, a four-wheeler¡­

204
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,701
Fortified body¡­
it's Japan's national treasure

205
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,938
So what?

206
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,578
Just go race with him for fun

207
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,755
It's really hot

208
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,600
I'd kick your ass if you were my dad

209
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,584
I'm leaving, take care

210
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,087
Take care, bye

211
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,315
Takumi¡­

212
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,923
Takumi

213
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,152
Takumi

214
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,226
Takumi

215
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,933
Didn't you say hot spring rice bun
is your favorite?

216
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:06,210
I'm very sorry you were punished
by the principal¡­

217
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:12,381
for beating up the boy because of me

218
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,793
I've been trying to thank you ever since

219
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,892
But each time I saw you,
you seemed to ignore me

220
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,792
It's because¡­I'm afraid¡­

221
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,033
I'm afraid the school¡­

222
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:30,732
Others in school would think¡­

223
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,434
Because¡­

224
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:38,282
You're afraid they would think you
and I are¡­

225
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:47,986
We've been in the same class
since grade school

226
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,993
We've always talked about anything

227
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,358
But these days it seems that
you're avoiding me

228
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,864
I haven't talked to you for weeks already

229
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,693
How's the bun?

230
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,605
So I can still talk to you in the future?

231
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:08,077
I have something important to tell you

232
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,481
I bought a very sexy swimsuit

233
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,024
Before the finals, you promised

234
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,994
to take me for as pin to the beach

235
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,325
Have you forgotten?

236
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:32,233
I bought the swimsuit right
after you told me that

237
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,966
At last I chose the one with the least cloth

238
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,212
Why're you looking like that?

239
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,338
You're choked?

240
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,514
Are you OK?

241
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,121
I'm okay¡­

242
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,559
How're you? Are you OK?

243
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,066
Don'ts care me

244
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,534
I'm okay

245
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:18,679
Takumi, you'll pick me up
at the station this Sunday

246
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,375
You promised

247
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,147
I gotta go now

248
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,818
Bye-bye.   Bye-bye

249
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:52,043
You'll pick me up at the station
this Sunday. You promised

250
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:57,686
Dad

251
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:02,359
Have you beaten a GTR
in MtAkina recently?

252
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,654
I think so

253
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:06,989
Was the car real fast?

254
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,492
It's seriously fast on straight roads

255
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,966
But when it entered corners,
it became real slow

256
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,737
You really found it slow?

257
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,238
What's it you wanna know?

258
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,568
Nothing really. Just curious

259
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,544
I bought a very sexy swimsuit

260
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,011
Do you need your car this Sunday?

261
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,084
Yeah

262
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,887
The market union is having a potluck.
Wanna go?

263
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,352
You wanna go?

264
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,966
What a rude brat

265
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,346
Hey, Tofuman

266
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,660
What's up, Gasman?

267
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:18,794
I'm looking for you

268
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,432
What for?

269
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,909
Got a fun and crowded place to go

270
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:40,190
Cheers

271
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,990
You're asking me out tonight

272
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,528
So you're not mad
I don't go to your gas station?

273
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:49,089
No¡­I was mad you asked
everyone not to come

274
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,832
Your gas was indeed more expensive

275
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,665
But my gas was of higher quality

276
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,204
So you asked me out to talk 'b out this?

277
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,330
No

278
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:00,969
I didn't expect you could still hold up
at your age

279
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,706
You asked these girls to test me out?
I'll show you

280
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:09,185
I'm referring to you winning the GTR
the other night

281
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,412
That wasn't me

282
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,457
I haven't been delivering in MtAkina
for years

283
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,884
So¡­I saw a ghost that night?

284
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,962
That was my boy Takumi

285
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,592
Takumi?

286
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:25,432
One night 5 years ago,
my hemorrhoids were hurting bad

287
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,130
It's excruciating.
They were this big. Damn

288
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,676
So I asked my boy to deliver for me

289
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,044
But¡­ he was barely 13 then

290
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,918
What's the big deal? It's MtAkina

291
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:45,854
There's not a soul at 4 in the morning

292
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,049
I would just let him

293
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:53,130
He left home at4

294
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,299
and returned at 5:30

295
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:59,935
A year later

296
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,766
he'd come back at 5:15, or even at 5

297
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,933
Two years later,
he's been back before 4:30

298
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,444
Within a half-hour? Including delivery?

299
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:15,050
It only takes him four and a half minutes¡­

300
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,643
to go around MtAkina

301
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:20,690
You telling me he never had an accident?

302
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:24,486
Not at all

303
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,894
Once he rushed home to sleep
and floored the pedal

304
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,031
All the tofu was crushed

305
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,986
Put this in the car

306
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:06,336
Don't spill a single drop, or I'll kill you

307
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:07,836
Go

308
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,644
It took him two hours to get back at first

309
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,287
Then¡­one and a half hour

310
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,318
A month later, it's an hour

311
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,483
Gradually it became half an hour

312
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,186
But I haven't been timing him LateLy

313
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,388
Your boy is so good

314
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:37,433
why don't you ask him
to race the GTR driver again?

315
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,502
I'll pay for the gas

316
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:43,730
I was treated as a shitty racer
when I was young

317
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,207
Who knows my boy would be even worse

318
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:50,404
You know he's the only son
in the whole family

319
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,641
If anything should happen to him¡­

320
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,841
Get another one then

321
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,619
Hey, Tofuman

322
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,957
Tofuman

323
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,986
But what 'b out the GTR?

324
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:08,927
And tonight's bill?

325
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,632
Tofuman. You bastard

326
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,369
Bring me the scissors

327
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,044
I bought a very sexy swimsuit

328
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:42,095
Boss, this Sunday¡­I'd like¡­

329
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,258
Let me through

330
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,194
What do you want?

331
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,237
Dad, I've decided not to buy the GTR now

332
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,370
That's my boy

333
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,672
Takumi's dad is right:
a racer should stand up again¡­

334
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,176
after each defeat

335
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,278
Dad

336
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,009
Let me race in your car tonight

337
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:02,746
My car?

338
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,648
From this moment on,
I'm no longer your dad

339
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,189
So how 's out Mom?

340
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,382
What 's out Mom?

341
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:10,426
If she knew you went to the night club
last night

342
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,392
what do you think she would do?

343
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:18,995
Who're you looking for?

344
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,331
Tofuman, you bastard

345
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,235
You sent my son to die,
Itsuki drove off with my car

346
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,638
You have to ask Takumi
to go to MtAkina to night

347
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,711
I'm not free right now

348
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,207
What you mean by that?

349
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,212
This is the first time I begged you,
and you said no?

350
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,250
What 'bout the nightclub bill last night?

351
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,492
What kind a tofu you want?

352
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,392
19 years ago, the fastest racer
in Gumma Province¡­

353
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,926
was Bunta Fujiwara of MtAkina

354
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,060
A gifted racer of that era

355
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,567
Many racers told me that¡­

356
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,271
you could be the first world champ
in Japan

357
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:05,212
But you chose to get married 19 years ago

358
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,581
You became a tofu man instead of a racer

359
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:14,019
Sometimes one decision can change
one's whole life

360
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,552
It goes with racing and it goes with life

361
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,498
But not everyone can figure out
the consequence

362
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:27,765
Like you didn't guess your wife
would leave you

363
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,167
Anger. That's what a racer needs

364
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:41,718
I wanna race you, just once

365
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,618
Sorry, what you want is not for sale here

366
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,896
Please go to another shop

367
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,461
Sorry to disturb you

368
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,180
Don't answer it. It's some asshole calling

369
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,024
Hey

370
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,453
You wanna use the car tomorrow?

371
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:05,668
Go up to MtAkina tonight.
If you can win the GTR

372
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,794
I'll let you use my car tomorrow

373
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,496
With a tank of gas

374
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,665
Brim full

375
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,629
Tofuman

376
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,631
If Takumi wins the GTR
at MtAkina tonight

377
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,998
your nightclub bill would¡­

378
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,668
would¡­you know?

379
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:00,815
We've blocked all the cars going
uphill already

380
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,088
All the roads are clear.
The race can start any time

381
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:24,507
Hey, racing god, give me a break, OK?

382
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:28,913
You couldn't even enter a curve.
With this car¡­

383
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,777
I'm afraid you'll die

384
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,889
What Cha doing? This is a public area

385
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,459
You can't block the road
with guys holding walkie-talkies

386
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,227
I'll call the cops

387
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,656
You really won't leave?

388
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,625
After you

389
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:47,666
What Cha doing?

390
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:50,229
Don't mess with my car

391
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:54,470
Don't touch my car

392
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,812
Ryousuke, an AE86 is coming uphill

393
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,187
The real racing god has arrived

394
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:12,887
Takumi's dad

395
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,196
Itsuki

396
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,570
Takumi, it's you? Where's your dad?

397
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:27,868
Uncle

398
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,507
Is he hiding?

399
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,808
No, he asked me to come¡­

400
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,674
For what? Delivering tofu?

401
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,814
No, to race the GTR

402
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:39,713
Stop pulling my leg

403
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,691
You don't even know
how to enter a curve. You'll die

404
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,157
That's ok. I've been delivering tofu here
for 5 years

405
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,289
I know, but you gotcha license last year

406
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,123
I already beat him once

407
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,404
So it was you last time?

408
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,641
Tofuman¡­

409
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,409
Tofuman

410
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:14,989
If Takumi wins,
is the nightclub bill settled?

411
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,458
Didn't we discuss this two hours ago?

412
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,994
Two hours ago?

413
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,967
The GTR is very fast.
You think Takumi has a chance?

414
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,070
All your cars were dearer and
faster than mine

415
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:29,604
But did you ever win, you idiot?

416
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,867
That's different, 'coz you're crazy

417
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,510
Did I ever say that my son is normal?

418
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,480
Five, four, three¡­

419
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,490
Go for it Two, one¡­

420
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,522
Go

421
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,468
Don't wag your tail too much

422
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,975
But the AE86 is not picking up speed

423
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,243
It's OK to lose a little at the beginning

424
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:18,344
There're less straights and
more sharp corners later

425
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,390
That will be the show time for my boy

426
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,831
The mighty GTR is leading all the way

427
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,875
The AE86 is no match for it
on straight roads

428
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,569
He may catch up at the corners

429
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,476
I'm afraid it has no chance
to get near the GTR

430
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:07,699
They're entering the curves.
The AE86 is gaining

431
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,739
Yet the GTR is extremely accurate
in turning

432
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,274
The AE86 has changed its tactic
and begins to drift

433
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,638
They're getting closer
at the center of the curve

434
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,678
The AE86 attacks the corner very fast

435
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,280
The cars almost touched each other as they drifted out

436
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,116
Your boy is really that good?

437
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,281
A few years ago, my boy told me
he needed glasses

438
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,450
So I took him to an optician

439
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,822
But his eye sight turned out to be 200

440
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,827
I told him: Hey, kid¡­

441
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:35,932
I'll kick your ass if you're kidding me

442
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,067
And he said, when he drove,
he found everything else

443
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,729
getting slower and slower

444
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,930
I knew then¡­

445
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,903
that he was getting faster and faster

446
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:59,179
I lost at this corner last time.
It won't happen again

447
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,594
The AE86 is sticking close to the GTR.
Unbelievable

448
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:11,632
The AE86 tries to overtake,
but the GTR blocks the lane

449
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,600
That's unfair. It's foul play

450
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,399
You like a good licking?

451
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,268
The AE86 fails to pass,
but they're closer at the corner

452
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,172
The AE86 is looking for a chance
at the back

453
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,556
If what you said is true,
then it's sure win for Takumi?

454
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,792
It all depends on¡­

455
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:48,527
the last 5¡­consecutive¡­.hairpins

456
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:06,081
The last 5 hairpins.
The AE86 is not slowing down

457
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,952
He can't pass at this speed

458
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,285
The AE86 has overtaken at the inner curve

459
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,755
Can the GTR catch up¡­

460
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,485
at the remaining hairpins?

461
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,337
The GTR is slowing down,
the AE86 has won

462
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:41,909
It's very funny the way you drove

463
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:45,488
Weren't you up the hill?
You're down already?

464
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:53,087
I heard you used the ditch
to enter the corner, right?

465
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,858
I'd like to race you too. You've got time?

466
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,629
I'm sorry. I raced tonight 'coz
my dad asked me to

467
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,301
I don't think there'll be a next time

468
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,837
Maybe you'll change your mind tomorrow

469
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,020
It's done

470
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:35,099
I've raised you right. You make me proud

471
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:26,020
Hey, come on

472
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,355
What is it?

473
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,852
Nothing

474
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,453
What's with the towel?

475
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:33,824
It's the sunlight

476
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,956
Don't be shy

477
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,993
Or you see me in swimsuit and¡­

478
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:41,961
I'm not

479
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,872
Takumi, why all these wounds?

480
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,046
These wounds are¡­

481
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,383
Inflicted by my dad

482
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,714
After Mom left us,
Dad got drunk all the time

483
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:01,154
He beat me up when he got drunk.
Disgusting, huh?

484
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,694
I think you look more hunky that way

485
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:10,397
A real man gotta have a few cars
on his body

486
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:14,061
I hate those sissies with smooth skin

487
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,532
Especially this one on your back

488
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,800
That's three years ago

489
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,302
This one is last week's

490
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:25,343
Does it hurt?

491
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,680
And here?

492
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,419
That's a mosquito bite

493
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,149
You fooled me

494
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,224
Here we are

495
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,845
Your driving is really good, Takumi

496
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:07,576
I always felt car sick on long rides

497
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:11,552
But I didn't even need to take pills today

498
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,278
That's good

499
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:17,750
I really had a fantastic time today.
Thanks so much

500
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:19,185
You're welcome

501
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:46,519
Bye-bye

502
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,518
Bye-bye

503
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,414
You know what's a god?

504
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,083
A god is actually human

505
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:24,187
But he can do what other humans can't

506
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,626
God, please save me

507
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,727
Please save my car as well

508
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:30,059
Sit down

509
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:44,011
Is the World Champ getting cuckoo?

510
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,376
He bought an AE86, that's why

511
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,007
What about him?

512
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:53,746
That's easy, he's in love

513
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,433
What's with you today?

514
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,676
You won't get it

515
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,345
Of course I will

516
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,348
A man's problem could only be cash
or chicks

517
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,484
What do you want?

518
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,457
You said you'd teach me to drive

519
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:34,928
When did I say that?

520
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:38,330
Who cares. I'll drive downhill
at the highest speed

521
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:39,730
Give me a few tips

522
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,805
Given my talents, things will sink in
after this once

523
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,366
Let's go then, it'll be quick

524
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:48,944
Have you fastened your seat belt?

525
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:08,757
Look out for the back

526
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:14,929
Wow, what a speed,
Can't wait to get laid or what?

527
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,139
Turn on the hazard lights. Let the car pass

528
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,179
Why's it kissing my ass?

529
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,212
What Cha want?

530
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,089
Sorry, I thought it's the tofu shop's AE86

531
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,461
But it's just¡­a piece of junk

532
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:47,431
Kids

533
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,801
Don't wander around at this hour

534
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,374
Better go home and sleep

535
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,372
He meant you

536
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,689
He must be gay,
wearing a bandanna at night

537
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,727
I think he's up on the hill for¡­

538
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:28,510
Junk¡­Simply junk

539
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:40,578
Let me drive

540
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,063
What Cha want? Say something

541
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:58,401
He was trying to kill us. Didn't you see?

542
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,566
So what?

543
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,169
He said you're a piece of junk

544
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,677
Let him say whatever he likes.
We don't care

545
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:07,874
Hey, the brake¡­

546
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,751
The brake, yo

547
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:23,797
The brake

548
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,401
Itsuki, what's wrong with your car?

549
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,061
What 'bout it?

550
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,435
It doesn't brake when it enters a corner

551
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:33,169
All four wheels are flying off the ground

552
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,208
And it almost over turns every time
it exits a corner

553
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,539
So why you still driving so fast?

554
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,807
I gotta chase that asshole

555
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:56,092
I wanna go home¡­. Dad

556
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,615
Daddy

557
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:08,503
Itsuki, are you OK?

558
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:16,471
Are you sure?

559
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,751
OK?

560
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,804
Takumi, what kind a driver are you?

561
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:46,768
Sorry for wrecking Itsuki's car.
I'll pay for it

562
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,308
I'm not talking about this. Do you know¡­

563
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:53,280
the guy last night is a member of
the Emperor Team?

564
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:55,010
He's a professional racer

565
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:59,415
You've beaten his EVO
in this piece of junk

566
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,547
Are you crazy or what?

567
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,125
But it's exactly the same as my dad's

568
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,921
How could it be the same?

569
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:09,361
Your dad has spent so much time
and effort on the car

570
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:13,230
It took him a month to find
the right suspension

571
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:14,963
This one over here¡­

572
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:18,536
Only an idiot like my boy could be
conned to buy this crap

573
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,538
Where's Itsuki?

574
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:32,087
The World Champ's useless.
Just as pin and he's been puking till now

575
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,952
Who would get car sick?

576
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:41,292
Takumi, you're different

577
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:43,591
You'll probably become an ace racer
one day

578
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,824
Keep it up

579
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,234
Hey

580
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,046
What's wrong?
You dropped your money?

581
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,913
The suspension.
It took you one month to fix it?

582
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,786
Why so long?

583
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,096
Not just the suspension

584
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,459
I needed to test the tires, the brake

585
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:20,058
vertical distance, balance
between front and rear¡­

586
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:23,434
It took about a month

587
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,070
Is it really fun being a racer?

588
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:30,404
Why? You wanna be a racer?

589
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,274
I dunno

590
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:33,841
You dunno?

591
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,474
Then come on in and help me make tofu

592
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,780
Your friend's been helping me
for the whole afternoon

593
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:39,889
My friend?

594
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,291
You're too kind

595
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:52,591
It's no trouble

596
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,529
Please have some tea, Uncle

597
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:59,538
The tofu is done.
I also made some dim sum

598
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:00,739
Thanks

599
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:01,868
You're welcome

600
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,248
Takumi, you're back

601
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:07,610
How come you're here?

602
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,776
Look who's talking

603
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:15,457
You haven't called me once
since the swim last time

604
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,253
So I came to pay you a visit

605
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:19,686
Natsuki, where's the dim sum?

606
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,490
Just a second

607
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:34,333
It's so nice having a woman in the house

608
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,240
Oh¡­and in such a short skirt

609
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:41,180
If only it's two inches shorter¡­

610
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,555
You should've called me first

611
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,149
I called you several times

612
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:51,556
Either you're at work or you're sleeping

613
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,691
Lucky that Uncle is a nice guy

614
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,161
He a in't no nice guy

615
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:58,664
But I've been chatting with him
on the phone for days

616
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,929
He's actually very fond of you,
you know?

617
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,165
You've been chatting with him for days?

618
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,270
What's so strange about it?

619
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,673
What did he say?

620
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:13,774
Uncle told me you wanna be a racer

621
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,317
I never said that

622
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,254
He also told me, if you try hard enough

623
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:24,554
you'll become a world class racer
some day

624
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:28,723
Someone once told me

625
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:32,732
it's most important to find a world that belongs to us

626
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:36,965
Life is meaningful only
when we can find this world

627
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:42,176
Takumi, I think for you,
this world is racing

628
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,411
Who told you that?

629
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:51,750
It's an uncle who told me that

630
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,047
Uncle?

631
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:58,893
Since my father died

632
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,163
he's been taking care of me and my mom

633
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:05,197
I thought it's my dad

634
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:08,699
I knew he couldn't be that deep

635
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,836
So who is this uncle, Natsuki?

636
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,996
It's most important to find a world
that belongs to us

637
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:47,241
Life is meaningful only
when we can find this world

638
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,250
If you try hard enough

639
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:02,017
you'll become a world class racer
some day

640
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:15,662
Takumi, I think for you,
this world is racing

641
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,320
You deliver tofu so early in the morning?

642
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,986
Something wrong with the car?

643
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,186
Wrong?

644
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,657
I'm tuning it

645
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,661
Remember I told you
I wanna race with you?

646
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,629
I never agreed

647
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,740
If I ask you again now, would you agree?

648
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:57,342
Co-ordinating the suspension and the tires¡­

649
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:59,310
really takes a whole month?

650
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,212
You wanna know?   Yeah

651
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,717
It's crucial to increase the barometer of
the turbo charger

652
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:06,982
But keep an eye on the input air volume

653
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:08,920
And the exhaust valve should be
accommodated

654
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,151
Suspension must be tuned based on
hardness and absorption

655
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,785
the tire size and its angle formed
on the road

656
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,932
plus the lower arm bar and tower bar

657
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,797
Then fine-tune it based on
the computer data

658
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,198
Your dad is incredible

659
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:27,633
If I were to retune it,
itwouId take me at least 6 months

660
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:32,341
The balance has been tuned to
its optimal level

661
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:33,913
Simply put¡­

662
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,145
It's perfect

663
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,283
So my old man is really that good

664
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:43,821
However, every car has its limit

665
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:48,188
You're bound to find it
unsatisfactory one day

666
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:49,893
Just get another one

667
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,126
But I only like AE86

668
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:55,702
So how 'b out our race?

669
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,499
3 weeks from now. On Saturday

670
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,208
That long?

671
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:05,640
You said it took 3 weeks to retune
your car, right?

672
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:27,961
That's him

673
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:28,968
Got it

674
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,416
Be careful, He's very fast in the corners

675
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,619
It's just an AE86 after all

676
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,984
Are you OK?

677
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,872
Listen, this junk is for tofu delivery

678
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:52,907
not for racing with us

679
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:56,374
It's for your own good, got it?

680
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:01,679
That's right. You are professional racers

681
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,583
Of course you look down on us
street racers

682
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,784
Professional and street, we're all racers

683
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:13,894
Right, you beat me once

684
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,662
You remember?

685
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,232
Wanna win again?

686
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:21,495
OK, call me, you have my team's number

687
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:23,828
Is the AE87 out already?

688
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,571
Isn't it the AE89 now?

689
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:08,445
Just talk, don't fight

690
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:11,816
Hitting your kid in public
will inflict mental damage

691
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:13,251
Shut up

692
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:19,622
Tofu man

693
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:22,626
Let's talk, don't fight

694
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:27,532
Hitting your kid in public
will inflict mental damage

695
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:29,966
I'm going home

696
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,994
Still upset about losing?

697
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:05,269
I asked Kyouichi who beat you
to race again in 3 weeks

698
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,505
You're invited

699
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,106
If you don't have another car, I do

700
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,819
Thanks, but I only wanna drive
my own car

701
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,681
Give me a call if you change your mind

702
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:49,243
Want some cheese cake? It's delicious

703
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,213
Natsuki bought it for you

704
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,318
When did she come?

705
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:04,659
She's going home for 2 weeks
but will call you later

706
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,704
What else did she say?

707
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,909
What else she's supposed to say?

708
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,547
Hey. Hey¡­

709
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:28,316
You eating the whole cake?

710
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:29,851
You'll be stuffed to death

711
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:38,290
Tofu man, your AE86 is already
an antique

712
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:42,152
Might as well change to a new car

713
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:45,859
Don't tell me you gonna put it
into the AE86?

714
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,026
Isn't this great?

715
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:53,203
This is for race car only.
You wanna go to jail?

716
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:58,636
You're nuts

717
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,469
Catching roaches, Itsuki?

718
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,209
No, looking for my old man

719
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,642
He hasn't been back for days,
just like you

720
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,037
Customer

721
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:35,640
That sucks. He's not young anymore

722
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:38,548
He's so irresponsible,
leaving his business like this

723
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,814
What's gonna happen to me
if it goes bankrupt?

724
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:43,550
It's good that I've been living on my own

725
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:44,886
or else I wouldn't be this chubby

726
01:12:53,736 --> 01:13:03,771
Boss. What are you doing?

727
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:09,116
Uncle, what're you up to?

728
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:12,616
We went for as pin at MtAkina

729
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:16,909
Has he come down yet?

730
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:18,577
Coming

731
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:29,461
Sounded like a high rpm

732
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:32,130
But it wasn't fast enough
as it entered the corner

733
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:25,653
Hop in

734
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:36,928
I'll only show you once

735
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:40,157
Watch carefully.
Pay attention to the new tachometer

736
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:49,734
Its power won't become obvious
till 11,000 revs

737
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,133
Sit tight. I wanna drive faster

738
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:41,120
Miya

739
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:45,365
The Kaiseki dinner was delicious, huh?

740
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:46,623
Not bad

741
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:48,227
I'm glad

742
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,365
Thanks so much for taking care of me¡­

743
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:52,766
when I puked two whole days last time

744
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:56,677
You were like a goddess who saved me

745
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:01,182
You're crazy

746
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:02,510
I mean it

747
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:04,985
I believe in gods

748
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:07,282
A god was actually human

749
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:10,320
but he could do
what other humans could not

750
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,756
So he became a god

751
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,221
But you know¡­

752
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:20,267
A god also does
what most humans do occasionally

753
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:24,065
What Cha wanna say?

754
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,605
Most humans would¡­

755
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:32,472
sometimes go to this neighboring
love hotel and¡­

756
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:36,516
It's OK since you're in the filling-up
business¡­

757
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:41,688
Bastard

758
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:56,331
Natsuki?

759
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:11,218
What the heck?

760
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:15,514
I test-drove the car with my dad
yesterday, you know?

761
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:19,616
This new car had a new tachometer.
I didn't know till yesterday

762
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:23,788
Just imagine, AE86, 250 horse power

763
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,725
You know how fast is 250 hp?

764
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,801
I tried to make a turn at 150 mph

765
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:34,501
It took me 3 minutes
through the entire MtAkina

766
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:36,038
Amazing, huh?

767
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:41,671
I really wanna tell everyone. You¡­

768
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:43,782
and Natsuki

769
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:47,749
No need

770
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,182
No need for what?

771
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:51,952
No need to tell Natsuki

772
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:57,827
Takumi

773
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:02,896
There's something
I wanna tell my best mate

774
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:03,936
Who?

775
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:05,966
You

776
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,268
Go ahead

777
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,246
I saw Natsuki¡­

778
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:19,448
She entered a love hotel with a guy

779
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:23,886
Love hotel?   Love hotel

780
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:25,356
There must be a mistake

781
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:31,730
It only costs 30,000 yen to bang her

782
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,134
What did you say?

783
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:41,266
30,000 yen to bang her

784
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:43,611
Your girl is a whore

785
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,548
Come again?

786
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:50,778
I don't want you get conned,
and you hit me?

787
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:51,877
Go to hell

788
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,348
Bastard!

789
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:57,015
Go to hell!

790
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,517
What you guys doing?

791
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:04,391
come over!
I've known you since 7

792
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:05,797
Don't!

793
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:11,799
Stop it!

794
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,407
Come, hit me!

795
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:18,242
Go ahead, hit me!

796
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:22,976
Takumi, stop it!

797
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:24,280
Let's talk!

798
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:25,684
Why fighting?

799
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:31,158
Pull him back!

800
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:36,063
Stop it, boy!

801
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:37,621
Stop it!

802
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:41,965
Takumi¡­

803
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:46,067
Why you hit him, you jerk?

804
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:49,099
Me a jerk? Yeah, I jerk off too

805
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:31,708
Hello? It's me

806
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,948
I shouldn't have called your girl a whore.
I'm sorry

807
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,543
You forgot? Today is Saturday

808
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:59,713
Everyone is waiting for you and
your AE86

809
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:15,312
Hello

810
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:15,923
Hello?

811
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:17,149
It's me

812
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:18,391
What's up?

813
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:19,790
I couldn't reach you for days

814
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:22,258
I've been in my hometown

815
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:25,957
I'm boarding the train now.
'll be back tonight

816
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:28,364
I'm racing in MtAkina tonight

817
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:30,166
Right after I'm done, I'll go see you

818
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:33,569
No, why don't I go see you
tomorrow instead?

819
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,175
The train is here. Talk to you later

820
01:23:35,276 --> 01:23:37,403
Natsuki, I wanna see you badly

821
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:43,516
Natsuki

822
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:48,486
I'm glad you stayed with me
this past holiday

823
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:51,458
Did I give you enough money last time?

824
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:59,800
We'd better not see each other anymore
after tonight

825
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:05,202
I don't wanna be like this anymore

826
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:10,067
I don't wanna see you again and
remember this

827
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:15,444
All I want is to be with Takumi

828
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,598
Isn't it too much, broom-head?

829
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,139
I know Ryousuke well

830
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:44,541
I will never lose to the same guy¡­

831
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:47,310
twice

832
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:57,449
Shit, I hope I didn't hurt him bad

833
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:02,089
Dream on, look who's talking

834
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,425
Your nose' been bleeding for days

835
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,596
See, here you go again

836
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:14,236
Damn. I hope it won't become
a monthly routine

837
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:22,380
What're we still waiting for?
Everyone's here already

838
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:23,609
Are you in a hurry?

839
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:25,542
Give him 5 more minutes

840
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:29,650
Who cares if he comes.
The race is between you and me

841
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:39,397
Block the road.
The race will begin in 5 minutes

842
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:41,765
Wait, a car is coming up

843
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,415
It's the AE86

844
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:07,022
There weren't so many girls at the races
in our days

845
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:08,325
That's right

846
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:11,990
Uncles, this is a ladies-only zone. Get lost

847
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:23,137
It's coming up¡­

848
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,053
So you've resurrected this piece of junk?

849
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:44,764
Way to go, tofu boy

850
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:47,561
What happened to the car you crashed
into the hill?

851
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:51,497
Tofu boy, you wanna go first?

852
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:55,700
No need. Just drive faster,
I got of her things to do

853
01:26:57,745 --> 01:26:58,837
For you

854
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:00,080
No need

855
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:02,282
Ryousuke has something to tell you

856
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:06,685
Listen. Although Kyouichi is
a professional

857
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:08,822
all professionals have their weaknesses¡­

858
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:11,448
You don't need to teach me.
I'm gonna win anyway

859
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:12,422
What about me?

860
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:13,785
I'll beat you too

861
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:57,304
The road is clear. We can start anytime

862
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:59,599
I repeat: We can start anytime

863
01:28:01,976 --> 01:28:02,908
Five

864
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:03,909
Four

865
01:28:04,045 --> 01:28:04,943
Three

866
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:05,875
Two

867
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:07,079
One

868
01:28:07,348 --> 01:28:08,246
Go

869
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:21,354
All three cars took off at top speed

870
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:23,521
Kyouichi's E3 is leading,
followed by Ryousuke's FC

871
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:24,529
The AE86 comes last

872
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:42,006
They've past the first corner

873
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,618
Both Ryousuke and Takumi
made their best lap time

874
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:47,346
Everyone's faster in the presence of
a professional

875
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:12,346
What Cha doing?

876
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,042
That's what we called strategy

877
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:15,740
The FC suddenly lags behind
before the tunnel

878
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,044
I wonder what's happened to Ryousuke?

879
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:49,377
The speed is unbelievable

880
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:51,314
All three cars exceed 100 kph
At the corner just now

881
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:52,386
The AE86 is waiting for its opportunity

882
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,078
Let's see if it can overtake the E3
in the next corner

883
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:55,746
Go for it, Takumi

884
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:57,788
Give it back. What's with you?

885
01:29:58,259 --> 01:30:01,194
What? It's a race

886
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:04,092
Of course we have to shout. Go ahead

887
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:33,558
Here we go

888
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:47,339
Over taken

889
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:48,602
The E3 doesn't leave much room

890
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:51,075
Both the FC and AE86 used the ditch
to overtake the E3

891
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:53,305
Let me explain, little girl

892
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:56,110
In street racing, a professional's common
weakness¡­

893
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:58,845
is to leave some open space
when taking a right corner

894
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:01,648
Go for it, Takumi

895
01:31:05,793 --> 01:31:07,283
Takumi, it's just you and me now

896
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:08,419
What 'bout the car at the back?

897
01:31:08,563 --> 01:31:09,655
I can block for you

898
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:11,162
Better watch your own ass

899
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:28,346
The AE86 and FC both managed
to pass a professional

900
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:30,075
But the E3 is trying to catch up

901
01:31:30,184 --> 01:31:31,742
Although they use different tactics

902
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:34,879
the FC and AE86 are way too fast
in entering corners

903
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:36,423
It's not an easy task catching up

904
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:50,967
Go for it, Takumi¡­

905
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:39,848
Attention, everyone

906
01:32:39,987 --> 01:32:42,217
A vehicle has just taken off
from the national park

907
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:43,757
and is heading up the mountain

908
01:32:43,858 --> 01:32:47,089
A car is coming ahead.
Get ready to slow down

909
01:32:51,499 --> 01:32:55,265
Kyouichi ignores the warning
and tries to overtake

910
01:33:00,608 --> 01:33:01,973
Should we block him?

911
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:03,407
It's too late

912
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:27,399
The E3 has crashed

913
01:33:27,568 --> 01:33:30,662
The AE86 and FC passed through.
The race goes on

914
01:33:30,838 --> 01:33:31,770
Is he OK?

915
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:32,963
Forget him

916
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:41,310
Kyouichi, are you OK?

917
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:12,410
The 5 consecutive hair pins.
Can the FC pass it here?

918
01:34:34,535 --> 01:34:38,027
The AE86 is at its limit. Now it's my turn

919
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:48,076
The FC has overtaken the AE86

920
01:34:48,215 --> 01:34:49,307
There's only 1 km left

921
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:50,611
I don't think the AE86 can make it

922
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:52,048
What the heck?

923
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:53,913
I knew it

924
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:54,715
You knew again?

925
01:34:54,822 --> 01:34:57,552
Takumi has never taken the leading
position before

926
01:34:57,725 --> 01:35:00,626
Ryousuke's car is powerful but
he still followed Takumi

927
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:04,322
He wants to learn his move
and then overtake him

928
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:06,129
So it's a lost case for Takumi?

929
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,200
Not necessarily

930
01:35:19,647 --> 01:35:21,774
You've been driving by yourself
all these years

931
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:24,580
You've never competed with anyone

932
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:26,077
Remember

933
01:35:27,521 --> 01:35:29,887
Don't pay attention to the competition itself

934
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:33,387
Ignore other racers

935
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:36,022
The one you need to beat is yourself

936
01:35:46,173 --> 01:35:48,334
Almost at the finish line.
The AE86 hasn't given up

937
01:35:48,442 --> 01:35:49,568
It's still right behind the FC

938
01:36:00,888 --> 01:36:03,049
The FC has missed its lane
when entering the corner

939
01:36:03,157 --> 01:36:05,216
Can Ryousuke with stand the pressure
from the AE86?

940
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:07,121
The pressure is from the tires

941
01:36:07,328 --> 01:36:11,196
It's retuned to 250 hp,
But the FC is still too powerful

942
01:36:11,365 --> 01:36:14,266
As time drags on, the tires won't hold up

943
01:36:14,401 --> 01:36:16,232
and the car can't go all the way in its drift

944
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:20,238
So the last 2 corners are the most crucial
in this race

945
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:21,830
It's here

946
01:36:56,844 --> 01:36:57,776
The finish line is up ahead

947
01:36:57,912 --> 01:36:59,641
The mighty FC has the absolute edge

948
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:01,042
The result is quite clear

949
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:17,322
The FC seems to be slower entering
the corner

950
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:20,227
The AE86 is taking the inner lane,
can it overtake?

951
01:37:36,517 --> 01:37:37,609
The AE86 has won

952
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:39,616
The AE86 is the ultimate racing
god of MtAkina

953
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:55,325
Great. He did it

954
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:04,743
He won

955
01:38:11,852 --> 01:38:13,183
Let's hug!

956
01:38:29,036 --> 01:38:30,731
I've lost anyway

957
01:38:35,643 --> 01:38:37,975
So what's your plan now?

958
01:38:38,112 --> 01:38:39,875
Nothing. You?

959
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:43,506
I'm gonna set up a new race team.
Wanna join?

960
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:48,244
Dunno. Gottago

961
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:51,916
Takumi, I really want you on my team

962
01:38:52,493 --> 01:38:53,721
Sleep on it

963
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:57,825
We¡¯ll see

964
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:27,915
Takumi

965
01:40:32,292 --> 01:40:37,059
Takumi. Takumi¡­

966
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:35,681
it's most important to find a world
that belongs to us

967
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:39,720
Life is meaningful only
when we can find this world

968
01:41:40,461 --> 01:41:45,023
Takumi, I think for you,
this world is racing

969
01:42:40,287 --> 01:42:41,652
So what's up? You lost or what?

970
01:42:42,055 --> 01:42:43,386
Hey. Hey¡­

971
01:42:43,524 --> 01:42:44,786
Let's drink to it

972
01:43:07,881 --> 01:43:08,575
Son of a bitch

973
01:43:10,284 --> 01:43:12,775
Itsuki, I'm sorry

974
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:25,290
Ryousuke, Takumi here

975
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:28,794
I'd like¡­

976
01:43:28,969 --> 01:43:30,266
to join your race team
