1
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:17,865
阁下果然是信人
So you've kept your promise

2
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:19,526
三位今天约我到这儿来
Why the three of you

3
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:20,535
有何见教？
want to meet me here?

4
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:22,299
你为什么杀我们四弟？
Why did you kill our fourth brother?

5
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:23,873
这倒怪了
That's strange

6
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:26,966
当时约我决斗的是你们四弟
Your fourth brother asked me to have a duel

7
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:30,535
难道我只输得而赢不得吗？
And I could only be defeated and can't win, right?

8
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:33,481
那你也用不着致他于死地
But you didn't have to kill him

9
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,885
要是我只伤了他
Well, if I just injured him...

10
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:38,477
你们三位不又怪我
then you would blame me for insulting

11
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:41,387
辱没你们中州四剑的威名吗？
the name of Four Swords of Zhongzhou

12
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:43,426
丁梦豪，你别仗着你的剑法高强
Ding Menghao, you can't just hurt others

13
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:45,085
就任意伤害江湖剑手
with your sword because you have good skills

14
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:47,527
你以为天下第一剑手这个称号
Do you think you can keep the title

15
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:50,099
会是永远的吗？
"Fastest Sword" forever?

16
00:01:53,737 --> 00:01:55,068
你们是看不惯我
Are you jealous of me

17
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:56,639
还是看不惯我的剑？
or my prowess with the sword?

18
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,709
不错，我们兄弟三人倒要领教
Well, let's find this out

19
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:51,354
好剑法
Excellent skills

20
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,596
好是好，不过火候还不够
It's good, but not refined enough

21
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:09,695
老家伙，你说什么？
Old man, what are you saying?

22
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:11,604
你跟他们有仇吗？
You have a grudge with them?

23
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,699
你管这个干什么？
It's none of your business

24
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:16,939
江湖传言丁梦豪出剑无情
Rumour has it that you're a ruthless killer

25
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:21,108
今日一见果然名不虚传
Now I know it is true

26
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:23,582
我很欣赏你的剑法
I admire your sword skills

27
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:27,646
不过要称天下第一剑嘛
But you don't really deserve the title

28
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:29,783
还早了点
'The Fastest Sword' yet

29
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,258
你不服？
So you're not convinced?

30
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:41,294
慢着，慢着
Wait, wait

31
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:43,965
如果你要想跟我动手的话
I don't mind having a duel with you

32
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:46,406
干脆咱们先把话讲清楚了
Let's however make things clear

33
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,875
再打也不迟
before we have a duel

34
00:04:47,978 --> 00:04:49,536
有话快说
Sure, tell me

35
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:54,242
如果你输给我怎么办？
What if you were defeated?

36
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:55,841
可能吗？
Is it possible?

37
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:58,779
我也知道不可能
Even I know it's impossible

38
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:00,379
我是说万一的话
I mean, just in case you were

39
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:01,924
那废话嘛
Rubbish

40
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:04,585
我输了你当然杀了我
If I were defeated you would kill me for sure

41
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:08,931
还不成呀？
You are not satisfied with it?

42
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:10,260
难道你要把我身上的肉
So you want to cut me dead

43
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,358
一块块的割下来？
piece by piece?

44
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:15,862
都不是，我这个人正好跟你相反
No, I am not like you

45
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:18,100
生平最不喜欢杀人
I don't like killing people

46
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:18,902
那你要怎么样？
So what do you want?

47
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,443
干干脆脆的把话说出来
Simply speak it out

48
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:22,671
这样吧
Okay

49
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,441
如果你要是败在我的烟杆之下
If you were defeated by my smoking pipe

50
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:28,245
你就得跟我三年，在这三年之内
You'd have to stay with me for three years

51
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:32,220
我要你干什么，你就得给我干什么
And do whatever I tell you to do

52
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,920
那我也改变主意了
Then I've a change of mind too

53
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:39,723
我也不杀你，你也得跟我三年
You also have to stay with me for three years

54
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,095
做我跟班，替我背行李
You'll be my servant and carry my belongings

55
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,758
我都是八十岁的人了
I am an eighty-year-old man

56
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:47,530
给你做跟班，不嫌老了点吗？
Don't you think I'm a bit old to be your servant?

57
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:51,096
我就喜欢你这个样子
Well, I like that

58
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:54,408
好，那是你答应了
Alright, so it is a deal

59
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:58,140
好，咱们动手，来
Okay, come on

60
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:21,003
慢着，你还打什么？
Wait, no need to fight anymore

61
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:23,766
你看看你的胸前
Take a look at your chest

62
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,178
乖乖的跟我走吧
So you come with me now

63
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:46,350
喂，喂
Hey, hey

64
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:27,453
师傅，师傅
Master, master

65
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:37,064
老家伙
Old guy!

66
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:47,178
你忘了我们的约定了吗？
You forgot our deal?

67
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:49,252
要是忘了，我早就跑了
If I did I'd be gone long time ago

68
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:51,616
那么就好好的坐在这儿
Then keep sitting here quietly

69
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:55,488
师傅，你既然要折磨我
Master, if you want to torture me

70
00:08:55,592 --> 00:08:57,355
换个花样好不好？
please find another way to do it, okay?

71
00:08:57,461 --> 00:08:58,155
这半年坐下来
I've been sitting here for half a year

72
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:00,229
坐得我腰酸背痛
I've almost got a back pain

73
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:04,558
你要想做些什么呢？
Then what do you want to do?

74
00:09:05,235 --> 00:09:06,463
随你的便
Anything

75
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,505
只要手脚能够活动活动就行了
Only if I could stretch my hands and legs

76
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,242
也好，我就给你换个样子
Okay, I'll let you do something else

77
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:31,527
你给我把这些经书一本本的抄完它
Copy all the scriptures in this room

78
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:33,926
然后一张一张的粘起来
then paste the copies one by one

79
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,760
转到这个木盘上面
and wind them around this wheel

80
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:39,934
抄完了再下楼来见我
Come down to see me after you've finished

81
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,297
抄完它？
All of them?

82
00:09:43,406 --> 00:09:45,567
怎么，不愿意？
What? Don't want to do it?

83
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:50,237
不愿意就跟我下楼去打坐，走
Then come and meditate with me. Let's go

84
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:53,839
好，好，我愿意，愿意
Okay, okay, I'll do it

85
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:26,828
师傅
Master

86
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,798
怎么，抄完啦？
What? Finished?

87
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,426
那么快呀？
So fast?

88
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:34,400
你上去看看就知道
Go take a look upstairs.

89
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:36,864
好
Okay

90
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,257
真快
Really fast

91
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:11,535
这个法子倒不错
This is a smart way

92
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:14,701
不过，你知道吗？
But do you know that

93
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:17,336
你的手指没有起茧
you don't have callus on your fingers

94
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:20,575
你的眼睛里面空空洞洞的
and your eyes look empty

95
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:22,878
就跟这卷白纸一样
They're just like this roll of white paper

96
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:26,353
外表好看，里面是什么也没有
Looks nice but it's nothing inside

97
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:29,016
我再抄下去眼睛都看不见了
I'll be blind if I keep copying

98
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,754
有些事情用心比用眼睛看
Sometimes you can see more clearly

99
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:37,561
是更清楚，更明白，你说是不是
with your mind, not your eyes, right?

100
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,261
师傅，我不是这种料
Master, I'm not that type of person

101
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,564
您白费力气
You would waste your effort

102
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:44,697
那么你说你是什么料呢？
So what type of a person are you?

103
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:48,869
我什么料都不是
I'm just nothing

104
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:53,912
现在懂得点谦虚了
Now you're starting to know what humility is

105
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:55,109
好了，好了
Okay, okay

106
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:56,480
别说风凉话了
Cut the crap

107
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:58,417
您就让我去挑土，砍柴
Just let me collect dirt, or cut firewood

108
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:00,921
什么粗活都行
I don't care if it is tough work

109
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:04,952
手里不抓个家伙，就缺少什么事
I'm lost if I don't have a tool in my hand

110
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:08,760
好吧，跟我来
Fine, follow me

111
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:21,403
做什么用？
What is this for?

112
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:23,570
你看见那块大石头了吗？
See that big rock?

113
00:15:27,784 --> 00:15:29,149
把它敲掉？
Want me to knock it into pieces?

114
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:31,347
不过要敲成个东西
No, you have to make something out of it

115
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:32,421
什么东西？
What?

116
00:15:32,522 --> 00:15:33,580
随你便
Whatever you want

117
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,521
你爱敲什么就敲什么
Just make it into something you like

118
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,115
现在我要下山去走走
Now I'll go downhill

119
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,718
半年以后我再回来看你
I'll be back six months later

120
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:23,469
好手艺
Very good skill

121
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,805
师傅
Master

122
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:29,945
你辛苦了
You've been working hard

123
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:31,741
您看怎么样？
What do you think?

124
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:39,582
好是好，不过…
It's very good, but...

125
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:42,249
怎么，您还不满意？
What? You don't like it?

126
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:47,227
不是不满意，只是太大了一点
Not really, it's just a bit too big

127
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,424
而且你让如来佛坐在山门旁边
Besides, don't you think it isn't very appropriate

128
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,626
不过份了点吗？
to put a Buddha in front of the door?

129
00:16:57,874 --> 00:16:59,603
这样吧，你改一改
Well, make some changes

130
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:00,937
我下山去办点事
I have to leave here now

131
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:03,239
半年以后咱们再见
See you six months later

132
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,668
师傅，您回来了
Master, you are back

133
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:41,714
不错，进步多了
Not bad, you have improved

134
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:43,718
不过…
But...

135
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,754
又太大了？
Too big again?

136
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:49,717
再改小点
Make it smaller

137
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:52,593
您这样一次次的改
You've made me change the size again and again

138
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:54,253
你急什么？
What's the hurry?

139
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,231
还有半年的时间呢
We still have another half year

140
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,665
好吧，您下您的山吧
Alright, you can leave now

141
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:01,737
我这次一定让您满意
I'm sure you'll be satisfied this time

142
00:18:22,992 --> 00:18:28,225
好极了，好一个玉面金刚
Excellent, what a beautiful statue

143
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:32,667
您想要的原来就是这个东西？
So this is what you want?

144
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:35,963
不错
That's right

145
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:37,835
您怎么不早说呢？
Then why didn't you tell me early?

146
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,376
让我花两三年的时间去雕石头
I've been spending years in stone carving

147
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:44,935
你认为不值得吗？你知道吗？
So you think it's not worth it?

148
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:47,642
如果你改行做雕工的话
If you took stone carving as a profession

149
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,685
将来你一定是一个名家的
you would be a famous craftsman

150
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:52,015
多谢师傅指点
Master, thanks for your teaching

151
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:53,110
我可以下山了吗？
Can I leave now?

152
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:54,416
你急什么？
What's the hurry?

153
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,014
我还要送给你一句话
I have one more thing to tell you

154
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,524
什么话？
What's that?

155
00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:59,254
如果你想活的话
If you want to live

156
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:02,229
你一定要死一次
You have to die once

157
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,064
那我就不懂了
I don't quite understand this

158
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:10,037
你将来会懂的，去吧
You will. Now leave

159
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:11,265
告辞了
Goodbye

160
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:31,588
"Chu's Drill Ground"

161
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:03,519
你都已经输了，还打什么？
You're defeated, why keep fighting?

162
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,033
丁老弟，又死了一个？
Brother Ding, another one died?

163
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:31,342
师傅
Master

164
00:20:31,454 --> 00:20:33,319
他到我们馆里来才两个多月
He's been here for less than three months

165
00:20:33,423 --> 00:20:34,082
已经有十来个人
And more than a dozen people

166
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,351
死在他的剑下
were killed by his sword

167
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,020
以后还多着呢
There will be more in the future

168
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,315
请问这位师傅…
Master, may I ask...

169
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:05,951
您是？
You are?

170
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:09,286
听说天下第一剑手丁梦豪
I've heard that the Fastest Sword, Ding Menghao,

171
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:10,586
就在这个馆里？
is in this place

172
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:12,320
你找他干什么？
Why are you looking for him?

173
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,029
比剑
To have a duel

174
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:18,123
比剑？你没看见这位英雄
A duel? Don't you see this man

175
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:20,099
刚刚死在他的剑下？
has just been killed by his sword?

176
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:22,034
你少嗦，他在哪儿？
Cut the crap. Where's he now?

177
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:24,168
上酒店喝酒去了
Go for a drink in the inn

178
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:41,588
您吃什么？
What do you want?

179
00:21:57,173 --> 00:21:59,334
大爷，您楼上请
Sir, please go upstairs

180
00:22:07,016 --> 00:22:09,507
掌柜的，有人来找他了
Boss, someone is looking for him

181
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,018
赶快收拾东西
Let's hide our stuff

182
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,697
阁下有何见教？
What do you want from me?

183
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,030
你就是被江湖黑白道上称为
So are you Ding Menghao,

184
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:29,764
天下第一剑手的南剑
the Southern Sword who is regarded by everyone

185
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:33,137
丁梦豪丁大侠吗？
as the Fastest Sword?

186
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:36,609
在下就是，请教…
Yes, I am, and you are?

187
00:22:36,712 --> 00:22:42,514
金剑帮少帮主毕正文久仰阁下大名
Bi Zhengwan from Golden Sword Clan

188
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:45,712
今天专程一会
I'm here only to meet you

189
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:53,286
毕兄何不坐下共饮一杯
Sit down and let's have a drink together

190
00:22:56,032 --> 00:22:59,331
我的话你还没答覆呢
You haven't answered me yet

191
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:03,462
我跟少帮主并无冤仇
There's no enmity between you and me

192
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:05,871
谁跟你有冤仇？
That's for sure

193
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:09,572
我只是来领教你的剑法
I just come to have a duel with you

194
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:13,447
要是我胜了你
If I won the duel

195
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:15,483
我就是天下第一剑手
I would be the Fastest Sword in the world

196
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:19,885
少帮主，在下只是徒负虚名
I really don't deserve such a title

197
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:22,457
你还是去找北剑邱一星吧
Go and look for Qiu Yixing, the Northern Sword

198
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,085
北剑邱一星，他算什么？
Qiu Yixing the Northern Sword? He's nothing

199
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:32,397
我不跟你比剑
I won't have a duel with you

200
00:23:34,337 --> 00:23:36,271
难道我不配？
Am I not qualified?

201
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:41,936
少帮主今年贵庚？
How old are you?

202
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:44,672
十八岁，这跟比剑有什么关系？
Eighteen. Why? It has nothing to do with a duel

203
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,441
当然有关系
Of course it does

204
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:48,608
所谓刀剑无情
Weapons are ruthless

205
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:53,519
丁某如败在你剑下并不可惜
If I were defeated, it's not a shame

206
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:56,854
少帮主年纪还轻，前程似锦
But you are still young, you have a future

207
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:59,359
你少教训我，拔剑
Don't preach. Draw your sword

208
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:06,732
你真不肯？
So you really refuse me?

209
00:24:19,115 --> 00:24:20,912
现在动手吧
Let's have a duel now

210
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:25,310
给我上帐
I'll pay later

211
00:24:29,225 --> 00:24:31,056
我就不信你不出手
I'm sure you will have a duel with me

212
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:46,466
站住，丁大侠
Stop, Master Ding

213
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:49,043
你再不出手，别怪我无礼了
Don't blame me if you still keep refusing

214
00:24:51,814 --> 00:24:55,306
我早告诉过你不跟你比
I've told you I don't want to fight with you

215
00:24:55,418 --> 00:24:56,214
还想要什么？
So what do you want?

216
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:57,250
告诉你
Let me tell you

217
00:24:57,353 --> 00:25:01,380
我要天下第一剑手六个字
I want these words: The Fastest Sword

218
00:25:02,725 --> 00:25:05,990
你别误会，我根本不是
You've made a mistake. I am not

219
00:25:22,445 --> 00:25:24,970
这小子真会找死
This kid is only here to meet his death

220
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:36,815
丁老弟
Brother Ding

221
00:25:37,727 --> 00:25:38,694
师傅
Master

222
00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:41,456
不瞒你说，自从你到我们寨上
Honestly, since you came to our village

223
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:44,294
可以说是没有一天安宁过
there's no peace here

224
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,368
所以父老们的意思
So the seniors suggested

225
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:49,438
希望你能够换一个地方
you should go somewhere else

226
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:50,971
这件事…
lt...

227
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:52,870
我知道
I understand

228
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:57,177
要不是虚名累我，何至于此呢？
It's all because I'm bearing an illusory title

229
00:25:58,981 --> 00:26:01,040
他也死得太年轻
He died too young

230
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,618
其实我不想杀他
Actually I didn't intend to kill him

231
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:04,947
也不想杀任何人
Nor anyone else for that matter

232
00:26:05,054 --> 00:26:08,148
这是大家给你凑的一点盘缠
We've gathered some money for you

233
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:19,364
我走好了，谢谢师傅
I'll leave now. Master, thank you

234
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,364
师傅请了
Master

235
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:52,991
这位壮士有何见教？
Anything I can help you with?

236
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:55,866
不敢，在下是来打听一个人
I am looking for someone

237
00:26:55,971 --> 00:26:58,701
丁梦豪，找他比剑？
Are you looking for Ding Menghao, to have a duel?

238
00:26:58,808 --> 00:27:00,298
我是要找丁梦豪
Yes, I'm looking for him

239
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:02,900
不过我是他的朋友
But I am his friend

240
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:04,809
他已经走了
He has left

241
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:05,573
走了？
Left?

242
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:09,947
走了好几天了，请
It's been several days. Goodbye

243
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:20,860
"Qing Feng Fortress"

244
00:27:33,209 --> 00:27:35,507
各位好…
Hello, everybody...

245
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:52,288
掌柜，您回来了？
Boss, you're back

246
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:54,862
你怎么老是管我叫掌柜的？
Stop calling me boss

247
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:55,726
张老弟
Brother Zhang

248
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:58,061
我们柳家寨的人都叫我柳大虎
Everyone here calls me Liu Da Fu

249
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:01,864
你叫我一声柳大哥不就行了吗？
You can just call me Brother Liu

250
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,064
是，柳大哥
Yes, Brother Liu

251
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:07,872
观音像什么时候完工？
When are you going to finish the Guanyin statue?

252
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,774
后天就可以交货
Day after tomorrow

253
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:12,177
不要紧，慢慢的刻吧
It's okay, take your time

254
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,508
把这个给我
Give this to me

255
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,599
伙计
Waiter

256
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:44,002
大爷
Yes, sir

257
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:44,909
您是要住店还是？
Do you want a room or?

258
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:45,776
住店
I want a room

259
00:28:45,881 --> 00:28:48,213
好，里面有雅房，请
Alright, we have nice rooms here, please

260
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:55,223
你们先吃饭，把家伙打点一下
Go get something to eat first

261
00:28:55,324 --> 00:28:58,452
我去向柳庄主讨个人情就回来
I'm going to ask Master Liu a favour

262
00:29:11,073 --> 00:29:13,371
王生，您太客气了
Wang Sang, you're too kind

263
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:15,875
一点薄礼，实在不成敬意
Just a little gift

264
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:17,946
希望庄主行个方便
I want to ask you a favour

265
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,447
给老朽在庄子上摆个场子
Please let me set up a vendor booth in your village

266
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:21,880
你尽管做就是了
That's no problem

267
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:23,542
柳东，把礼收下
Liu Dong, take the gifts inside

268
00:29:23,652 --> 00:29:25,586
赏给他二两银子
And give him a silver nugget

269
00:29:25,955 --> 00:29:27,047
这怎么可以？
No need

270
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:28,885
庄主肯让老朽摆个场
I should be very grateful to have your permission

271
00:29:28,991 --> 00:29:30,083
老朽已经感激不尽
to set up a vendor booth

272
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:33,025
都是道上朋友，收下收下
We are friends. Take it

273
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:35,187
恭敬不如从命
Okay, if you insist

274
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:39,165
多谢庄主厚赐
Thank you very much.

275
00:29:39,268 --> 00:29:40,496
请
Goodbye

276
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,865
老朽告辞
I have to go, goodbye

277
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,240
柳东，刚才你说什么？
Liu Dong, what did you say just then?

278
00:29:48,344 --> 00:29:50,505
您知道我们庄上的那间雕刻店？
You know that stone carving shop in our village?

279
00:29:50,612 --> 00:29:52,603
你说大虎呀，他怎么啦？
You mean Da Fu? How's he doing?

280
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:54,580
听说大虎店里来了个年轻的石匠
Da Fu's shop has a new mason recently

281
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:56,776
手艺好，可是人很怪
Very good skill, but a bit strange

282
00:29:56,885 --> 00:29:58,443
他平时就难得说一句话
He seldom utters a word

283
00:29:58,554 --> 00:30:01,318
而且就连大门口都不迈出一步
and never leaves the shop

284
00:30:01,423 --> 00:30:02,151
他进庄的时候
When he came to our village

285
00:30:02,257 --> 00:30:04,191
还有人看见他带了一把很好的剑
Someone saw him with a very good sword

286
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:06,022
您看他会不会是…？
Do you think he might be?

287
00:30:06,128 --> 00:30:08,028
爹，要不要让我去看看？
Dad, do you want me to check?

288
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,098
女孩子要少管闲事
This is not a girl's business

289
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:12,326
这样吧，你先去探探他的底细
Well, you go and check his background

290
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:14,766
看看他究竟是什么来头
Find out where he is from

291
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:49,304
张老弟，不如你喝一杯
Brother Zhang, come have a drink

292
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:51,805
等一会儿再干活也不迟嘛
Take a break first

293
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:53,867
好
Okay

294
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,246
柳大哥，我陪你喝一杯就是
Brother Da Fu, let's have a drink

295
00:31:05,954 --> 00:31:09,788
老弟，你到我们寨上也快一个月
You've been here for almost a month

296
00:31:09,892 --> 00:31:12,656
我有一句话一直想问你
There's something I always want to ask you

297
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:15,193
什么话？
What is it?

298
00:31:15,297 --> 00:31:17,231
你真的叫张新？
Is Zhang Xin your real name?

299
00:31:17,332 --> 00:31:20,631
柳大哥，我当然叫张新
Brother Liu, Zhang Xin is my name for sure

300
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:22,829
您喝，我去赶工
You carry on, I've to get back to my work

301
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:27,072
你的手艺是跟谁学的？
From whom did you learn this skill?

302
00:31:27,576 --> 00:31:32,513
我的手艺是给别人逼出来的
I was kind of forced to practice this skill

303
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:40,813
张老弟，我总觉得你有什么心事
Seems that you always have something on your mind

304
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:42,550
心事？
Something on my mind?

305
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:45,218
没有呀，我有什么心事？
No, nothing like that

306
00:31:45,594 --> 00:31:46,720
你是有点特别
You are a bit strange

307
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:49,696
平时门也不出，话也不说
You don't go out, and you don't talk

308
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:54,933
小弟天性如此，装也装不出来
That's my nature, one's own personality

309
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:59,070
你会耍剑？
You know how to use a sword?

310
00:32:01,977 --> 00:32:05,970
会不敢说，喜欢就是
Not really, I just like swords

311
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:09,482
柳大哥，莫非你怀疑我来路不正
Brother Liu, are you suspecting me?

312
00:32:09,585 --> 00:32:12,611
哪里哪里，我只是随便说说的嘛
No, no... just asking

313
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:50,558
谁呀？
Who is it?

314
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:14,781
强盗来了
It's the bandits

315
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:19,887
老弟，还不快躲？想死呀？
Brother, hurry. Find a place to hide

316
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:05,295
夜劫柳家庄
You dare rob our village

317
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,027
你们是哪一路上的朋友？
Who are you?

318
00:34:07,135 --> 00:34:10,127
老匹夫，你迟早会知道的
Old man, you will know sooner or later

319
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:16,638
往哪儿跑？
Where are you going?

320
00:34:40,502 --> 00:34:43,403
好小子，你是个聋子？
Hey, are you deaf?

321
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,446
走
Let's go

322
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:14,229
快走，快…
Let's go, hurry...

323
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:18,504
奇怪
I don't understand

324
00:35:18,607 --> 00:35:21,701
我一生从未亏待过江湖上的朋友
I've never been ungrateful to anyone

325
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,937
竟然有人劫庄
But someone has come to rob our village

326
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:24,705
我们庄上以往
Nothing like this happened

327
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:28,271
从来没有发生过这种事情
to our village in the past

328
00:35:31,987 --> 00:35:35,514
听说庄上的人在谈论一件怪事
Everyone is talking about a strange thing now

329
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:36,522
什么怪事？
What is it?

330
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,956
我也是听说的
I heard that

331
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,654
说是庄上每户人家被抢劫
every house in our village was robbed

332
00:35:40,762 --> 00:35:41,592
只有大虎的雕刻店…
Except Da Fu's stone carving shop...

333
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:43,392
你说这件事情与大虎有关？
You mean Da Fu is somehow related to the robbery?

334
00:35:43,498 --> 00:35:44,465
他说的不是大虎
What he means is not Da Fu

335
00:35:44,566 --> 00:35:45,396
那是谁？
Then who?

336
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,901
就是大虎店里那个叫张新的石工
Zhang Xin, the mason who works for Da Fu

337
00:35:49,705 --> 00:35:50,399
是他？
That guy?

338
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:52,370
听说劫匪进了大虎的雕刻店
It's said that when the robbers got in Da Fu's shop

339
00:35:52,474 --> 00:35:54,567
见了张新扭头就走
they left immediately on seeing Zhang Xin

340
00:35:54,676 --> 00:35:55,438
有这种事？
Is that so?

341
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:58,377
你没瞧见大虎的店还是好好的？
Don't you see that Da Fu's shop is still in shape?

342
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,278
你是说他们见了张新就吓跑了？
You mean Zhang Xin scared them away?

343
00:36:01,383 --> 00:36:02,748
不信你问问大虎
You can ask Da Fu

344
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:04,478
那是他亲眼看见的
He saw this with his own eyes

345
00:36:04,586 --> 00:36:07,885
听说还有更神的呢
And there's something more strange

346
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:09,149
事情发生的时候
When the robbers came in

347
00:36:09,257 --> 00:36:11,020
大虎躲在房里吓得半死
Da Fu was hiding inside the room and scared to death

348
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:12,923
张新一点也不害怕
But Zhang Xin was very calm

349
00:36:13,028 --> 00:36:14,655
还在继续他的工作
He kept doing his work

350
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:16,492
你们说怪不怪？
Don't you think this is strange?

351
00:36:16,598 --> 00:36:19,431
这小子可能跟劫匪有关系
This guy may have a connection with the robbers

352
00:36:19,534 --> 00:36:23,231
就算没关系，也总有点什么来头
If he doesn't, he must have a background

353
00:36:23,338 --> 00:36:27,297
要不然的话，他一定是个探子
Or he must be a spy

354
00:36:47,195 --> 00:36:48,958
老弟，你…
Brother, you...

355
00:36:49,064 --> 00:36:51,464
柳大哥，我走了
Brother Liu, I'm leaving

356
00:36:51,566 --> 00:36:55,093
走？你是为了庄子人说你闲话？
Leaving? Because of the rumours in the village?

357
00:36:58,306 --> 00:37:02,640
大家都说我跟那些劫匪有关系
Everyone says I've a connection with the robbers

358
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:06,578
你说我在这儿还能呆得下去吗？
Do you think I can stay here anymore?

359
00:37:17,993 --> 00:37:20,791
柳大哥，还没做完的佛像
Brother Liu, the unfinished statue

360
00:37:20,896 --> 00:37:23,364
就劳驾你把它去完成
please finish it for me

361
00:37:23,732 --> 00:37:25,597
我也留不住你
So I can't stop you

362
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:27,598
我走了
I'm leaving

363
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:28,862
慢点
Wait

364
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:38,177
你就是张新？
Are you Zhang Xin?

365
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,372
是
Yes

366
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:41,142
总管，有什么吩咐？
Sir, how may I help?

367
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:44,309
没有什么，我们庄主想见见你
Our master wants to see you

368
00:37:45,287 --> 00:37:47,653
庄主要见我？
He wants to see me?

369
00:37:49,491 --> 00:37:51,755
是的，我有点事要找你
Oh yes, there's something I need you to do for me

370
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,350
您有什么吩咐？
What is it?

371
00:37:53,462 --> 00:37:54,929
听说你的手艺很好
I've heard that you have very good skills

372
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,055
我们柳家祠堂需要一只炉鼎
And our ancestral temple needs a stone altar

373
00:37:57,165 --> 00:37:57,859
想请你…
I wonder if...

374
00:37:57,966 --> 00:38:00,264
庄主之命，小的不敢不从
I'd do whatever you want me to do

375
00:38:00,368 --> 00:38:02,700
只是小的正要离开这儿
But it's just that I'm going to leave this place

376
00:38:02,804 --> 00:38:05,432
啊，你要走了？
You're leaving?

377
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:09,067
为什么？
Why?

378
00:38:09,177 --> 00:38:11,372
是不是听到什么闲话？
Is it because of the rumours?

379
00:38:11,847 --> 00:38:13,678
假如是为了这一点的话
If this is the reason

380
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:15,875
你就更不能走
then you should stay here

381
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:22,382
你这么一走
Leaving just like that would mean

382
00:38:22,491 --> 00:38:23,753
不就等于承认这件事
that you do admit

383
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:25,383
跟你有关系吗？
you have something to do with this robbery

384
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:27,291
我看你就再呆一段时间
I think you should continue staying here for some time

385
00:38:27,395 --> 00:38:30,455
事情总会有个水落石出的
And we will find out the truth in due course

386
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,631
好吧，如果没有别的事
Well, if there's nothing else

387
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:39,206
小的就告辞了
then I better get going

388
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:40,501
请便
Okay

389
00:38:48,283 --> 00:38:50,148
张新气宇不凡
There's something specially inspiring about Zhang Xin

390
00:38:50,252 --> 00:38:54,348
以我看来他不是普普通通的人
I'm sure he's not an ordinary guy

391
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:58,756
他究竟是什么人迟早会知道的
Sooner or later we'll find out what he is

392
00:39:01,563 --> 00:39:03,053
钟场主，干得好
Chief Zhong, well done

393
00:39:03,164 --> 00:39:04,358
多谢教主夸奖
Thanks

394
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:05,831
先杀杀他的威风
Let's smash his power and prestige first

395
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:08,494
然后我再去找他算十年前那笔旧帐
Then I'll go take my revenge

396
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:10,230
不过那天晚上我们在庄上
But that night in the village

397
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:12,363
看到一个人，好像是丁梦豪
We saw a person who looked like Ding Menghao

398
00:39:12,474 --> 00:39:13,202
什么？
What?

399
00:39:13,308 --> 00:39:16,937
你说你看见失踪了几年的南剑？
The Southern Sword who went missing years ago?

400
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:18,307
不会的，假如是他
No, it couldn't be him. If that was him

401
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:19,573
你们还有命回来？
you wouldn't come back alive

402
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:21,581
门下也不敢确定
I am not sure either

403
00:39:22,817 --> 00:39:25,877
不过也不是没有这个可能
But that's also possible

404
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,886
假如是他
If that's him

405
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:32,983
那真是踏破铁鞋无觅处
Then this will be my luck

406
00:39:33,094 --> 00:39:34,686
得来全不费工夫？
to end my long and tough search

407
00:39:34,796 --> 00:39:36,661
您要找他？
Are you looking for him?

408
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:42,192
难道我飞天蜈蚣就不配找他？
You think I'm not qualified for this?

409
00:41:00,682 --> 00:41:01,649
柳小姐
Miss Liu

410
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,412
我只是想看看你的剑
I just want to take a look at your sword

411
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:08,046
我的剑跟别的剑没有什么不同
It's no different to the other blades

412
00:41:08,156 --> 00:41:09,054
你既然有剑
Since you do have a sword

413
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:10,283
那天晚上为什么…
That night why didn't you...

414
00:41:10,392 --> 00:41:11,359
不怕你笑话
It's a shame to tell the truth

415
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:12,983
我根本不会用剑
but I don't know how to use a sword

416
00:41:13,094 --> 00:41:15,927
这把剑只是挂着玩的
I just hang it here for fun

417
00:41:17,365 --> 00:41:20,061
说，你是谁？
Tell me, who are you?

418
00:41:25,173 --> 00:41:27,801
柳小姐，你这是什么意思？
Miss Liu, what do you mean?

419
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:29,774
我终于试出你的功夫来
At last I hit upon a way to test your skills

420
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:32,039
假如你是普通人
If you were an ordinary person

421
00:41:32,147 --> 00:41:34,911
绝不能进来得没有一点声息
you couldn't enter the room without making any noise

422
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:36,881
说，你是谁？
Tell me, who are you?

423
00:41:36,985 --> 00:41:40,546
再不说，当心我刀下无情
If you don't speak, don't blame me

424
00:41:43,925 --> 00:41:46,951
既然你为了试探我的武功而来
Since you're here to test my skills

425
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:48,324
那么我就告诉你
then let me tell you the truth

426
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,295
因为我被仇家追杀
I have enemies after me

427
00:41:50,398 --> 00:41:53,492
只好躲到你们庄上来
So I came to hide in your village

428
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:56,126
那么你是一名剑手？
So you're a swordsman?

429
00:41:56,538 --> 00:41:57,903
说不上是剑手
Not really

430
00:41:58,006 --> 00:42:01,032
只是在江湖上浪荡浪荡就是
I'm just a wanderer

431
00:42:06,614 --> 00:42:09,139
你既然有仇家追杀
If your enemies are after you

432
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,184
那光想躲是躲不掉
You can't just hide away

433
00:42:13,021 --> 00:42:17,685
强盗来了…
The bandits are coming...

434
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,257
强盗
Bandits

435
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:21,726
怎么回事？
What's the matter?

436
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:26,857
就是这里
Over here

437
00:42:26,968 --> 00:42:29,368
马家大杂院的人就是他
He's the one in the martial arts school of Ma village

438
00:42:29,471 --> 00:42:31,029
下去看看
Let's go take a look

439
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:33,370
他就是躲到十八层地下
Even if he's hiding in hell

440
00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:34,942
也把他找出来
we have to find him out

441
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,614
什么？又来了？
What? Here again?

442
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:48,188
那十几个人气势汹汹
Those several guys are coming fiercely

443
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:50,154
可能就是那班劫匪
They may be at the village now

444
00:42:50,258 --> 00:42:51,885
好，去看看
Okay, let's go take a look

445
00:43:13,748 --> 00:43:15,909
原来你在这儿
So you are here

446
00:43:17,585 --> 00:43:18,381
您是…
You are...

447
00:43:18,486 --> 00:43:19,544
你还记得吗？
Don't you remember?

448
00:43:19,654 --> 00:43:23,556
上个月在马家大杂院武术馆里
Last month in the martial arts school of Ma village

449
00:43:25,293 --> 00:43:26,089
毕帮主
Chief Bi

450
00:43:26,194 --> 00:43:28,219
当时在下实在是无意杀少帮主
I didn't want to kill your son then

451
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:28,761
完全是…
It's because of...

452
00:43:28,863 --> 00:43:30,455
是什么？
Of what?

453
00:43:36,104 --> 00:43:37,401
朋友请了
My friend

454
00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:38,199
阁下是…
You are...

455
00:43:38,306 --> 00:43:40,137
老朽柳长风
I am Liu Changfeng

456
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:42,740
你就是神风剑客
So you are the Xinfeng Swordsman!

457
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:43,868
正是老朽
That's correct

458
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:46,412
阁下大概就是金剑帮的毕帮主了？
And you must be Chief Bi of the Golden Sword Clan

459
00:43:46,514 --> 00:43:47,446
不敢
I am

460
00:43:47,549 --> 00:43:50,746
帮主，来到荒庄有何见教？
Chief, what brings you to our small village?

461
00:43:50,852 --> 00:43:52,149
我来找那小子
I've come looking for that guy

462
00:43:52,253 --> 00:43:53,845
你跟他有仇？
You two have enmity?

463
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:56,446
他杀死了我的儿子
He killed my son

464
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:02,656
我到庄外去等你
I'll wait for you outside the village

465
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:04,994
一个时辰你不到
If you don't show up in two hours

466
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,088
柳兄
Brother Liu

467
00:44:06,201 --> 00:44:09,364
我们只好再进庄向你要人了
Then I will come and ask you for this guy

468
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,767
走
Let's go

469
00:44:17,912 --> 00:44:20,244
张新，这件事情
Zhang Xin, this time

470
00:44:20,348 --> 00:44:22,839
我们实在无能为力
we can't offer much help

471
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,317
祸是你一个人闯的
You killed his son

472
00:44:25,753 --> 00:44:28,688
也只好你一个人担当了
So you have to be responsible for this

473
00:44:37,465 --> 00:44:40,332
你们放心，我不会连累大家
Don't worry, I won't get you into trouble

474
00:44:40,702 --> 00:44:41,430
我们回去吧
Let's go home.

475
00:44:41,536 --> 00:44:43,026
爹
Dad

476
00:44:43,137 --> 00:44:44,365
走吧
Let's go

477
00:45:08,196 --> 00:45:09,527
我说那小子不简单吧
I did say that guy is really something

478
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:10,290
仇家来找上他了
Now his enemy is here for him

479
00:45:10,398 --> 00:45:10,921
在那儿？
Where?

480
00:45:11,032 --> 00:45:12,431
在那儿
Over there

481
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:16,130
说不定上次劫庄那批家伙
Maybe those who robbed our village last time

482
00:45:16,237 --> 00:45:18,034
就是来找他
actually came for him

483
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:19,231
他来了
He is here

484
00:45:47,502 --> 00:45:49,129
客倌
Sir

485
00:45:49,237 --> 00:45:49,862
伙计
Waiter

486
00:45:49,971 --> 00:45:51,632
这人是谁？
Who is that guy?

487
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:53,263
对面雕刻店的石工
The mason of the stone carving shop

488
00:45:53,374 --> 00:45:55,342
他的仇家来找他来了
His enemy is coming for him

489
00:45:55,443 --> 00:45:58,344
这一去准没命
He won't come back alive

490
00:45:58,713 --> 00:46:00,704
大爷里面请，马交我
Please come inside. I'll take care of the horse

491
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:20,259
小子，动手吧
Kid, come on

492
00:46:22,437 --> 00:46:26,373
毕帮主，那天的事情
Chief Bi, even that day

493
00:46:26,474 --> 00:46:30,342
在下的的确确实在不得已
I didn't have any say in the matter

494
00:46:32,113 --> 00:46:33,375
拔剑
Draw your sword

495
00:46:40,021 --> 00:46:42,888
自从误杀少帮主之后
After that unfortunate incident when your son died

496
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:45,221
在下发誓不再用剑
I swore never again to draw my sword

497
00:46:45,326 --> 00:46:46,953
我不管你发什么誓
I don't care

498
00:46:47,061 --> 00:46:50,462
我就知道报杀子之仇，动手吧
I just want revenge for my son. Let's fight

499
00:46:53,468 --> 00:46:55,936
我不相信你有这般忍劲
Let's see how long can you tolerate

500
00:47:27,935 --> 00:47:31,496
爹，如果张新他…
Dad, if Zhang Xin...

501
00:47:31,606 --> 00:47:33,233
你管这干什么？
It's none of your concern, dear

502
00:47:33,908 --> 00:47:36,399
那不是让张新去送死吗？
You're sending him to his death

503
00:47:36,778 --> 00:47:38,746
可是金剑帮我们惹不起
The Golden Sword Clan rather not be our foes

504
00:47:38,846 --> 00:47:40,711
再说这是他个人的事情
And moreover this is his personal matter

505
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:41,577
我们也犯不着…
We don't have to...

506
00:47:41,682 --> 00:47:43,582
爹，我们总不能见死不救吧？
Dad, we can't just let him die, right?

507
00:48:04,806 --> 00:48:09,175
拔剑吧，看来你是死定了
Take out your sword. You're dead

508
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,049
望帮主再明察
Chief, please forgive me

509
00:48:15,783 --> 00:48:18,274
那可怪不了我了
Then don't blame me

510
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:36,065
好吧，既然你不想再用剑了
Okay, if you don't wish to use the sword anymore

511
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:38,798
那我就断了你的右臂
Then let me chop off your right arm

512
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:45,010
毕帮主，算了
Chief Bi, stop it

513
00:48:45,113 --> 00:48:46,876
人家已经受你欺负够了
You've been bullying him enough

514
00:48:46,981 --> 00:48:49,040
带你的剑手走吧
Leave with your men

515
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:53,350
你什么人？
Who are you?

516
00:48:53,454 --> 00:48:54,421
这个你不需要问
You don't need to ask

517
00:48:54,522 --> 00:48:56,422
你也不配知道
And you are not qualified to know

518
00:48:56,524 --> 00:48:57,149
上
Get him

519
00:48:57,258 --> 00:49:00,227
慢着，请壮士慢动手
Wait, please don't

520
00:49:00,328 --> 00:49:02,353
通通给我上，上
All of you, attack

521
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:22,577
来吧，我的手也痒了
Come on, my arm is itching

522
00:49:39,567 --> 00:49:43,936
朋友，我生平最看不惯这种事情
Pal, I simply can not tolerate this kind of thing

523
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:45,828
多谢兄台援手
Brother, thanks for your help

524
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,966
别客气，你贵姓？
Don't mention it. What's your name?

525
00:49:49,076 --> 00:49:52,011
小的姓张，叫张新
My name is Zhang Xin

526
00:49:52,113 --> 00:49:53,944
请教兄台贵姓？
How about you?

527
00:49:54,048 --> 00:49:55,879
我叫邱一星
I am Qiu Yixing

528
00:49:57,451 --> 00:49:59,544
北剑？
The Northern Sword?

529
00:49:59,654 --> 00:50:03,181
在下就是北剑邱一星
Yes, I'm Qiu Yixing the Northern Sword

530
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:14,257
你受伤了？
Are you hurt?

531
00:50:14,368 --> 00:50:15,562
没有
No

532
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,195
张兄，我先走一步
Brother Zhang, I have to go now

533
00:50:25,746 --> 00:50:27,145
你的伤？
Are you alright?

534
00:50:27,248 --> 00:50:29,512
不要紧，多谢小姐关心
I'm okay. Thank you, Miss

535
00:50:34,021 --> 00:50:36,421
他们都是你杀的吗？
You killed them all?

536
00:50:36,524 --> 00:50:39,084
不是，我哪有这种本事
No, I don't have such skill

537
00:50:39,193 --> 00:50:40,820
是刚才那个人
It's that person

538
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:45,028
他是谁？
Who is he?

539
00:50:45,132 --> 00:50:48,966
他是当代武林绝代剑手
He's a top swordsman

540
00:50:49,937 --> 00:50:51,529
也算我有缘
I am really fortunate

541
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:55,166
能看到他出神入化的剑法
to witness his fantastic swordplay

542
00:51:00,047 --> 00:51:03,312
刚才我真为你担心
I've been worrying about you

543
00:51:09,724 --> 00:51:11,214
我们回去吧
Let's go home

544
00:51:13,027 --> 00:51:17,259
他能逃命回来，邪不邪？
He comes back alive, what a surprise!

545
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,024
你懂什么？
What do you know?!

546
00:51:18,132 --> 00:51:19,793
听说他向人家跪下瞌头
The word is he knelt down and kowtowed

547
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,128
才保住命的
to keep his life

548
00:51:21,235 --> 00:51:23,999
要不然早被人家宰了
Otherwise he would be slain

549
00:51:24,105 --> 00:51:24,799
你别损人
Don't slander people

550
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:27,396
我们张老弟只是不想出手
Brother Zhang just didn't want to fight

551
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,108
大虎，别吹了
Da Fu, stop boasting

552
00:51:33,214 --> 00:51:36,115
都被人打成这样了还不想出手
He was beaten up and didn't want to fight back

553
00:51:36,217 --> 00:51:38,651
天下会有这种事？
I don't think this is the case

554
00:52:03,544 --> 00:52:05,034
朋友，你贵姓？
Pal, what's your name?

555
00:52:05,146 --> 00:52:08,547
我叫大虎，加付碗筷来
I'm Da Fu. Bring him a bowl and a pair of chopsticks

556
00:52:08,649 --> 00:52:09,638
来了
Coming

557
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,081
大虎，你在庄上住多久了？
Da Fu, how long have you been in this village?

558
00:52:11,185 --> 00:52:12,777
生下来就在这儿
Since I was born

559
00:52:12,887 --> 00:52:14,411
那你知不知道有个叫丁梦豪的
Do you know a person named Ding Menghao

560
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:15,750
住在庄上？
who lives in this village?

561
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:19,451
丁梦豪？没有
Ding Menghao? No

562
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,289
他在庄上多久了？
How long has he been here?

563
00:52:21,395 --> 00:52:23,295
大约一个月
About a month

564
00:52:23,397 --> 00:52:28,061
我们柳家庄外人很少，除了张新
We seldom have strangers here, except Zhang Xin

565
00:52:28,169 --> 00:52:31,263
您找丁梦豪是不是一个石工？
This Ding Menghao... would he be a mason?

566
00:52:31,372 --> 00:52:33,272
石工？
A mason?

567
00:52:37,645 --> 00:52:40,614
说不定，也许他真的改行
Probably, he may have taken up a new profession

568
00:53:02,903 --> 00:53:04,029
邱兄
Brother Qiu

569
00:53:06,841 --> 00:53:07,865
是你？
It's you

570
00:53:07,975 --> 00:53:09,169
你还没有走？
Still staying here?

571
00:53:09,276 --> 00:53:11,972
我还有点私事没办完，你忙吗？
I have things to do. Are you busy now?

572
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:12,977
没什么
Not really

573
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,876
既然没事
In that case

574
00:53:13,981 --> 00:53:15,608
上酒馆喝一杯吧
let's go and have a drink

575
00:53:15,716 --> 00:53:16,580
这个…
I...

576
00:53:16,684 --> 00:53:18,914
怎么，不肯赏脸？
What? Don't want to give me some face?

577
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:21,581
好
Okay

578
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:24,250
请
Please

579
00:53:31,198 --> 00:53:32,324
请
Please

580
00:53:34,902 --> 00:53:38,133
邱兄到我们庄上来有什么事吗？
Brother Qiu, what brings you here?

581
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:39,763
想找个朋友
I am looking for a friend

582
00:53:39,874 --> 00:53:41,364
找到了没有？
Have you found him yet?

583
00:53:41,475 --> 00:53:42,737
找是找到了
I've found him

584
00:53:42,843 --> 00:53:47,280
不过我那个朋友还不想见我
But he doesn't want to see me

585
00:53:51,886 --> 00:53:55,982
张兄，我有两句话想跟你请教
Brother Zhang, I have something to ask you

586
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:58,991
邱兄有话尽管说吧
Brother Qiu, go ahead

587
00:53:59,093 --> 00:54:00,424
我想问你
I just want to ask

588
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,655
你是不是拿我当朋友？
Do you treat me as a friend?

589
00:54:02,763 --> 00:54:03,752
那还用说
Of course

590
00:54:03,864 --> 00:54:07,766
邱兄对我的恩情我还没有报答呢
I haven't had a chance to repay your kindness

591
00:54:07,868 --> 00:54:10,632
那么我想问你一句话
Then I want to ask you

592
00:54:10,738 --> 00:54:13,366
你是不是丁梦豪？
Are you Ding Menghao?

593
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,340
你承认了？
So you are?

594
00:54:45,606 --> 00:54:47,665
邱兄，你…
Brother Qiu, you...

595
00:54:47,775 --> 00:54:52,474
丁梦豪，我找的人就是你
Ding Menghao, I am looking for you

596
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,175
一时大意，几乎错过了
I'm so careless, I almost missed you

597
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:59,118
邱兄，难道我有什么地方冒犯你
Brother Qiu, did I offend you in the past?

598
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,016
没有
No

599
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,088
那么究竟怎么回事？
Then why are you looking for me?

600
00:55:02,189 --> 00:55:03,713
我要跟你比剑
I want to have a duel with you.

601
00:55:03,824 --> 00:55:04,483
比剑？
A duel?

602
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,288
不错，你我被称为南北双剑
Yes, we are called Southern and Northern Swords

603
00:55:07,394 --> 00:55:09,021
所谓一山不容二虎
No two tigers can live on one mountain

604
00:55:09,129 --> 00:55:10,619
武林天下当然也不容有两个
So it means there can't be two top swordsmen

605
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:11,663
第一剑手
in this world

606
00:55:11,765 --> 00:55:12,697
我们该决个胜负
We have to find out who is number one

607
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,266
邱兄
Brother Qiu

608
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:16,234
至少应该找出一个真正的第一剑
At least find out who is the true Fastest Sword

609
00:55:17,304 --> 00:55:21,104
邱兄，小弟的剑法自信不如你
Brother Qiu, my skill is not better than you

610
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:23,472
邱兄才是天下第一剑手
You're indeed the top most swordsman in the world

611
00:55:23,577 --> 00:55:25,943
天下第一剑手在我们比剑之后
We will find out who is the Fastest Sword

612
00:55:26,046 --> 00:55:30,210
自有分论，怎么样？
after the duel, how's that?

613
00:55:33,654 --> 00:55:35,485
我不能接受
I can't accept this

614
00:55:37,491 --> 00:55:40,756
难道邱兄不把我当做朋友看待？
Don't you treat me as a friend?

615
00:55:40,861 --> 00:55:43,091
我们交朋友是一回事
Being friends is one thing

616
00:55:43,197 --> 00:55:46,894
决斗又是一回事
Having a duel is another

617
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:54,169
不过我已经发誓不再用剑
But I have sworn I'd never use a sword

618
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:56,402
你的决心我知道
I know of your determination

619
00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:02,312
不过不出三天我会叫你答应
But you'll change your mind in three days

620
00:56:04,952 --> 00:56:07,682
不会的，邱兄，告辞了
I sure hope not. Goodbye

621
00:56:07,788 --> 00:56:08,652
我说
I tell you

622
00:56:08,756 --> 00:56:10,121
总管，您有什么事吗？
What's the matter?

623
00:56:10,224 --> 00:56:11,816
你们赶快早点收店
Close the shop as soon as possible

624
00:56:11,926 --> 00:56:12,722
为什么？
Why?

625
00:56:12,826 --> 00:56:13,986
照我的话做
Just do it

626
00:56:14,094 --> 00:56:17,086
柳总管，出了什么事？
Mr. Liu, what happened?

627
00:56:17,197 --> 00:56:20,360
你不知道庄主的旧仇人飞天蜈蚣
Master Liu's enemy Flying Centipede

628
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:23,027
要庄主亲自到旧城外赴约
wants to have a duel with him outside the village

629
00:56:23,137 --> 00:56:26,004
要不然就要血洗柳庄
Otherwise he will kill everyone in our village

630
00:56:28,008 --> 00:56:31,171
原来上次劫庄的就是他们
So it was them who robbed the village last time

631
00:56:31,278 --> 00:56:32,210
你们赶快离开这儿
You better leave here now

632
00:56:32,313 --> 00:56:34,008
留点神，我走了
Be careful. I have to go

633
00:56:40,054 --> 00:56:41,282
丁兄
Brother Ding

634
00:56:41,388 --> 00:56:44,323
这一次我看你不用剑是不行了
I think you have to use your sword again

635
00:56:44,425 --> 00:56:47,485
飞天蜈蚣是不简单的
Flying Centipede is not an easy guy

636
00:57:01,308 --> 00:57:04,641
柳长风，你还认得吴某人吗？
Liu, do you still remember me?

637
00:57:06,981 --> 00:57:10,314
你想不到我还会活到今天吧？
You must be surprised that I'm still alive?

638
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:12,783
的确出我柳某人意料之外
Yes, I am really surprised

639
00:57:12,886 --> 00:57:15,320
十年前你杀我于断魂崖
You wanted to kill me ten years ago

640
00:57:15,422 --> 00:57:17,822
尊驾屠杀江湖人物心黑手辣
Because you had cruelly killed many people

641
00:57:17,925 --> 00:57:20,655
我只不过是为天下人除害而已
And I just want to do a favour to the martial world

642
00:57:20,761 --> 00:57:21,750
废话少说
Cut the crap

643
00:57:21,862 --> 00:57:24,126
你死到临头，你知道吗？
You are going to die, don't you know that?

644
00:57:24,231 --> 00:57:25,789
尊驾既然找我寻仇
If you want to have revenge on me

645
00:57:25,899 --> 00:57:28,367
何以日前屠杀庄人？
why then did you kill my village folk before?

646
00:57:28,469 --> 00:57:30,437
那是让你瞧瞧我的厉害
Just to let you see how powerful I am

647
00:57:30,537 --> 00:57:33,028
柳长风，你亮刀吧
Liu, show your blade

648
00:57:34,408 --> 00:57:35,534
让我来
Let me kill him

649
00:57:35,976 --> 00:57:38,911
谁来都是一样，你们跑不了
You can't escape from me

650
00:57:39,013 --> 00:57:40,241
上
Fight

651
00:58:30,397 --> 00:58:32,957
好小子，你找死？
Kid, you want to die?

652
00:58:33,067 --> 00:58:37,902
飞天蜈蚣，带着你的人回去吧
Flying Centipede, leave with your men

653
00:58:39,406 --> 00:58:42,375
原来你就是那个姓丁的？
So you are that guy named Ding?

654
00:58:42,743 --> 00:58:43,573
你来干什么？
What are you doing here?

655
00:58:43,677 --> 00:58:45,611
我来表示我的清白，那次劫庄
I want to prove my innocence. The robbers...

656
00:58:45,713 --> 00:58:48,011
我知道跟你无关，快走
I know you have nothing to do with them. Leave now

657
00:58:48,716 --> 00:58:52,174
来，我飞天蜈蚣向你领教
Come on, let's see how good you are

658
00:59:37,397 --> 00:59:39,092
还不滚
Get away

659
00:59:45,739 --> 00:59:49,072
快走…
Let's go...

660
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,406
慢走
Wait

661
00:59:57,818 --> 00:59:59,285
你到底是谁？
Who are you really?

662
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:06,917
他就是名震天下的南剑丁梦豪
He is the famous Southern Sword, Ding Menghao

663
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:13,757
好个丁梦豪
Well, Ding Menghao

664
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:16,392
你竟然骗我说什么被仇家追杀
The other day you lied that you're pursued by enemy

665
01:00:16,503 --> 01:00:18,562
跑到我们庄上来隐居
and sought shelter in our village

666
01:00:18,672 --> 01:00:19,866
柳小姐，在下…
Miss Liu, I...

667
01:00:19,973 --> 01:00:23,033
别在下在上，我讨厌人家骗我
Stop it, I hate people lying to me

668
01:00:24,478 --> 01:00:27,345
丁兄，我们该动手了吧
Brother Ding, we should have a duel now

669
01:00:27,447 --> 01:00:29,074
你是谁？
Who are you?

670
01:00:29,183 --> 01:00:30,616
我是邱一星
I am Qiu Yixing

671
01:00:30,717 --> 01:00:32,048
北剑？
The Northern Sword?

672
01:00:33,954 --> 01:00:35,546
二位大侠莅临荒庄
We have two famous heroes in our village

673
01:00:35,656 --> 01:00:38,022
请恕老朽有眼无珠
Please forgive my ignorance

674
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:39,956
今日若非丁兄相救
If we didn't have Brother Ding here to help

675
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,584
老朽及庄人恐怕…
My village and I would be...

676
01:00:41,695 --> 01:00:43,890
有南剑在，你们还怕什么？
The Southern Sword is here, you shouldn't be afraid

677
01:00:43,997 --> 01:00:45,259
丁兄，动手吧
Brother Ding, let's have a fight

678
01:00:45,365 --> 01:00:46,195
动手？
A fight?

679
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,232
我找他比剑
I want to have a duel with him

680
01:00:47,334 --> 01:00:48,801
比剑？
A duel?

681
01:00:51,238 --> 01:00:53,433
常言道二虎相争必有一伤
When two tigers fight, one is bound to be hurt

682
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,337
二位何必呢？
So why insist on this?

683
01:00:55,442 --> 01:00:56,568
我要是不跟他斗出个
I want to have a duel with him to find out

684
01:00:56,677 --> 01:00:58,338
谁是天下第一剑手
who is the top most swordsman in the world

685
01:00:58,445 --> 01:01:00,140
我活着还有什么意义？
Otherwise my life will be meaningless

686
01:01:00,247 --> 01:01:01,612
丁兄
Brother Ding

687
01:01:05,118 --> 01:01:06,346
邱兄
Brother Qiu

688
01:01:06,453 --> 01:01:10,355
小弟已经决心不再跟人家比剑
I've decided never to have a duel with other people

689
01:01:12,192 --> 01:01:13,887
你怕死？
Are you afraid of death?

690
01:01:17,664 --> 01:01:19,029
懦夫
Coward

691
01:01:29,943 --> 01:01:31,501
也好
Fine

692
01:01:31,612 --> 01:01:34,046
我只好用别的办法叫你斗剑
I'll figure out another way to make you have a duel

693
01:01:34,147 --> 01:01:35,171
失陪
See you

694
01:01:48,729 --> 01:01:49,855
柳大哥
Brother Liu

695
01:01:49,963 --> 01:01:54,297
刚才姓邱的来过
That Qiu fellow was here a while back

696
01:01:54,401 --> 01:01:58,064
他用剑劈毁了这些东西
He destroyed everything with his sword

697
01:02:02,843 --> 01:02:05,437
他欺人太甚
This is too much

698
01:02:15,889 --> 01:02:18,323
老弟，这到底是怎么回事？
Brother, what is this all about?

699
01:02:18,425 --> 01:02:22,191
你们不是朋友吗？怎么会…
I thought you guys are friends! How come...

700
01:02:29,403 --> 01:02:32,031
柳大哥，都是我连累你
Brother Liu, it's all my fault

701
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:34,869
丁大侠，丁大侠，不好了
Mr. Ding, something happened

702
01:02:34,975 --> 01:02:36,033
怎么回事？
What's the matter?

703
01:02:36,143 --> 01:02:38,168
我们小姐给人家劫走了
Our miss is kidnapped

704
01:02:38,278 --> 01:02:38,972
真有这回事？
Really?

705
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:40,603
当然真的
That's true

706
01:02:44,217 --> 01:02:45,479
一定是他
It must be him

707
01:03:01,601 --> 01:03:04,968
邱一星，你好卑鄙的家伙
Qiu Yixing, you are despicable

708
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:06,334
你不要动怒
Don't get angry, if you promise to have a duel

709
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,806
你答应动手，捣毁的东西我照赔
I'll pay for everything I've broken

710
01:03:08,909 --> 01:03:10,467
你为什么劫走柳小姐？
Why kidnap Miss Liu?

711
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:11,635
柳小姐被人劫走？
Miss Liu has been kidnapped?

712
01:03:11,745 --> 01:03:12,677
别装蒜了
Don't play dumb

713
01:03:12,779 --> 01:03:14,610
丁兄，我邱一星生平为人
Brother Ding, I dare not claim

714
01:03:14,715 --> 01:03:16,114
不敢说怎么正直
I am a man of integrity

715
01:03:16,216 --> 01:03:18,844
但至少不会对女人下手
But at least I won't harm a woman

716
01:03:19,686 --> 01:03:20,846
一定是他
It must be him

717
01:03:20,954 --> 01:03:22,546
谁呀？
Who?

718
01:03:23,256 --> 01:03:25,952
我知道劫走柳小姐的是谁
I know who'd have kidnapped Miss Liu

719
01:03:26,059 --> 01:03:28,357
你要我告诉你，可以
I can tell you, no problem

720
01:03:28,462 --> 01:03:32,956
不过条件是你要跟我比剑
But you must have a duel with me

721
01:03:37,571 --> 01:03:41,473
好，你说
Okay, tell me

722
01:03:41,575 --> 01:03:43,008
那么我们走
Then let's go

723
01:03:58,525 --> 01:03:59,321
就是他
It's him

724
01:03:59,426 --> 01:04:01,656
丁大侠，我知道你会来的
Mr. Ding, I knew you would come

725
01:04:01,762 --> 01:04:02,751
是你劫走柳小姐？
You kidnapped Miss Liu?

726
01:04:02,863 --> 01:04:03,329
不错
Right

727
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:04,055
为什么？
Why?

728
01:04:04,164 --> 01:04:05,756
对了，丁大侠
Mr. Ding

729
01:04:05,866 --> 01:04:07,561
一个月前你杀死了我弟弟
You've killed my younger brother a month ago

730
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:09,965
黑蛇剑客
The Black Snake Swordsman

731
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:13,335
我弟弟剑法除了南北双剑之外
He had very good sword skills. Only the

732
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,237
敢说没有敌手
Southern and Northern Swords are better than him

733
01:04:15,342 --> 01:04:17,867
而当时北剑邱一星
And there was no way the Northern Sword

734
01:04:17,978 --> 01:04:19,570
不可能来到南方
could come to the south at that time

735
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:22,239
所以我断定你杀死了我弟弟
So it must be you who killed my brother

736
01:04:22,349 --> 01:04:23,373
我根本没有杀你的弟弟
I didn't kill your brother

737
01:04:23,483 --> 01:04:23,881
还赖？
You're still denying

738
01:04:23,984 --> 01:04:28,011
慢，白蛇剑客，你找错了人了
Wait, White Snake, you've got the wrong guy

739
01:04:28,121 --> 01:04:29,986
你弟弟是我杀死的
I killed your brother

740
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:31,352
我是北剑邱一星
I'm Qiu Yixing, the Northern Sword

741
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:34,086
在路上我杀死了黑蛇剑客
I've killed Black Snake on the road

742
01:04:34,194 --> 01:04:35,957
把剑收起来
Retrieve your sword

743
01:04:36,063 --> 01:04:36,654
柳小姐呢？
Where's Miss Liu?

744
01:04:36,763 --> 01:04:38,355
在关帝庙里
In the temple

745
01:04:38,465 --> 01:04:41,992
不过我死了她也完了
But if I died, she'll die too

746
01:04:42,102 --> 01:04:43,694
我给她吃了一种药
I've fed her some poison

747
01:04:44,638 --> 01:04:46,572
又是这一套
It's not a new trick

748
01:05:03,056 --> 01:05:03,613
起来
Get up

749
01:05:03,723 --> 01:05:04,212
什么事？
What?

750
01:05:04,324 --> 01:05:06,224
我要你死得瞑目
I want you to die in peace

751
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,139
解药一定在他身上
He must be carrying the antidote

752
01:05:22,242 --> 01:05:23,869
我先到关帝庙去
I'm going to the temple now

753
01:05:30,617 --> 01:05:34,075
清儿，清儿
Qing Er...

754
01:05:34,187 --> 01:05:35,814
赶快给她喝解药
Give her the antidote now

755
01:05:42,896 --> 01:05:47,265
丁兄，柳小姐已经找到了
Brother Ding, we've found Miss Liu

756
01:05:47,367 --> 01:05:49,392
你曾经答应过我的
And the matter you've promised me

757
01:05:49,503 --> 01:05:50,026
现在？
Now?

758
01:05:50,137 --> 01:05:51,297
废话
Bullshit

759
01:05:51,404 --> 01:05:51,836
你听我说
Listen!

760
01:05:51,938 --> 01:05:52,962
不必多说
Enough

761
01:05:53,073 --> 01:05:55,268
明天一早我在这儿等你
I'll be waiting here for you tomorrow

762
01:07:29,169 --> 01:07:30,898
来了，他来了
He's coming

763
01:07:58,765 --> 01:08:00,392
你们不要进来
Don't go inside

764
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,195
总有一个会出来的
One of us will come out at last

765
01:08:41,308 --> 01:08:44,175
丁兄果然没有令我失望
So you've come eventually

766
01:09:09,402 --> 01:09:13,498
丁兄，邱某领教了
Brother Ding, I want to learn from you

767
01:09:20,613 --> 01:09:24,709
邱兄，咱们既然结为知己
Brother Qiu, since we are friends

768
01:09:24,818 --> 01:09:26,547
你昨天答应我的
You've promised me yesterday

769
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:29,411
是的
Right

770
01:09:29,522 --> 01:09:33,549
不过老兄又何必苦苦相逼呢？
But why are you so persistent about the duel?

771
01:09:34,761 --> 01:09:39,130
你是不知道找你比剑，分个高下
It's all about finding out who is the best

772
01:09:39,232 --> 01:09:42,201
是我邱一星这一生最大的愿望
This is the only wish in my life

773
01:09:42,302 --> 01:09:43,633
拔剑
Draw your sword

774
01:09:44,337 --> 01:09:50,105
邱兄，兄弟对剑刀荒废已久
Brother Qiu, I haven't practiced for a long time

775
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:50,801
甘拜下风
I admit defeat

776
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:52,172
丁梦豪
Ding Menghao

777
01:09:52,278 --> 01:09:54,838
你连剑都不出鞘就说这种风凉话
You say so when your sword is still in the sheath

778
01:09:54,948 --> 01:09:56,745
岂不是存心侮辱我吗？
Are you trying to insult me?

779
01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:00,251
不，这是梦豪肺腑之言
No, I speak from my heart

780
01:10:00,353 --> 01:10:01,843
邱兄千万不要误会
Brother Qiu, don't take me wrong

781
01:10:01,955 --> 01:10:02,785
误会？
Take you wrong?

782
01:10:02,889 --> 01:10:05,687
我告诉你，今天你非动剑不可了
You have to use your sword today

783
01:10:05,792 --> 01:10:06,816
看剑
Watch out

784
01:10:08,795 --> 01:10:12,458
你是不是非动手是不行了
You have to use your sword this time

785
01:11:14,861 --> 01:11:17,694
邱兄，我们还要比吗？
Brother Qiu, do we still have to fight?

786
01:11:17,797 --> 01:11:19,628
少废话，拔剑
Quit beating around the bush, now out with your sword

787
01:11:21,968 --> 01:11:25,233
不用了，我已经输了
No, I've lost already

788
01:11:25,905 --> 01:11:30,569
不，你剑不出鞘，我不能算赢
No, your sword is still in the sheath. I didn't win

789
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:39,918
你一定要看我的剑？
So you have to see my sword?

790
01:11:41,488 --> 01:11:44,389
久闻丁兄手上所拿的
I've heard that your sword

791
01:11:44,491 --> 01:11:46,857
是把七星名剑
is a rare treasure

792
01:11:54,801 --> 01:11:59,363
好吧，那么我就让你看看
Okay, I'll let you have a look

793
01:12:11,317 --> 01:12:13,046
断剑
A broken sword

794
01:12:16,823 --> 01:12:21,453
邱兄，这就是我不再用剑的决心
Brother Qiu, this is the proof of my determination

795
01:12:21,561 --> 01:12:24,121
那我的剑就不能比你的长
Then my sword can't be longer than yours

796
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:33,868
好，现在我们该动手了
Okay, we should start now

797
01:17:44,884 --> 01:17:46,818
太大
It's still too big

798
01:18:36,202 --> 01:18:39,228
丁梦豪，上天下地
Ding Menghao, wherever you go

799
01:18:39,338 --> 01:18:41,465
今天你是逃不了
You can't escape today

800
01:19:19,979 --> 01:19:22,140
再小一点
Make it smaller

801
01:20:56,008 --> 01:20:57,373
怎么办？
What should we do?

802
01:21:00,646 --> 01:21:01,874
让我们来
Let us do it

803
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:34,937
请问老丈，有一个叫丁梦豪的
Old sir, is there a person named Ding Menghao

804
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,337
是不是在你们寨上？
living in your village?

805
01:22:36,442 --> 01:22:38,069
你找他干什么？
Why are you looking for him?

806
01:22:38,177 --> 01:22:39,144
比剑
To have a duel

807
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:40,405
比剑？
A duel?

808
01:22:43,182 --> 01:22:44,444
他已经死了
He's already dead

809
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:46,415
死了？
He died?

810
01:22:46,886 --> 01:22:49,411
昨天他跟北剑邱一星比剑
Yesterday he had a duel with the Northern Sword

811
01:22:49,522 --> 01:22:51,717
他们都死了
They both died

812
01:22:51,824 --> 01:22:54,224
你看，现在正在下葬
See, that's their funeral

813
01:23:32,998 --> 01:23:34,465
我来迟了一步
Guess I'm a little late

814
01:23:41,173 --> 01:23:46,133
"The grave of Ding Menghao and Qiu Yixing"

815
01:23:58,991 --> 01:24:02,427
谢谢你父亲想出这个办法
I'm truly grateful for your father's wonderful idea

816
01:24:03,429 --> 01:24:05,294
这是庄人的意思
It's the unanimous decision of all the villagers here

817
01:24:05,397 --> 01:24:08,525
他们都希望你留下
They all want you to stay

818
01:24:08,634 --> 01:24:10,101
这样别人就以为
The other people will thus think

819
01:24:10,202 --> 01:24:12,363
你真的跟北剑一起死了
that you died together with the Northern Sword

820
01:24:12,471 --> 01:24:15,634
今后再不会有人找你比剑
And no one will again seek you to have a duel

821
01:24:24,283 --> 01:24:33,157
"The grave of Ding Menghao"
