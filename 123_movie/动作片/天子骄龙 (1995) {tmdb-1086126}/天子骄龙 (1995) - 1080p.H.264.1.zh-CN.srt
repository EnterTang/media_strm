1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:01,770
Listen to me.

2
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,606
- Hey, man, get your hands off me.
- Listen. Listen!

3
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:06,875
You want respect in this game,
then you're gonna have to earn it.

4
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:08,643
I know they taught you that
at Cheyney State.

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,843
Why don't you teach your kids something?

6
00:00:10,953 --> 00:00:13,683
Yeah, he made a bonehead move
but you had 30 before that.

7
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:16,155
And it didn't affect the outcome.

8
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:18,556
You want respect, you give it.

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,025
You earn it.

10
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:22,825
Come on, Coach.

11
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:25,126
- All right. All right.
- We got a long drive. Long drive.

12
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,461
Okay.

13
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,036
- Get back, guys. Come on!
- Come on, get your stuff.

14
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:30,536
Get back, everybody.

15
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:33,107
Come on, let's go. Get your stuff.

16
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:37,072
I couldn't swim right?

17
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:39,739
No, 'cause I was blinded
by the reflection off his white behind.

18
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:42,009
I'm telling you, man,
bobbing up and down in the water.

19
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:44,585
I couldn't even... I couldn't even see.

20
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:49,683
Best stroke out there
was Willie's butterfly.

21
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,782
Yeah, we were all watching that.

22
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:56,887
Hey, I'm just glad to be out them boonies,
you know what I'm saying?

23
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:58,728
- Them white boys...
- Man, hey, you know.

24
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:01,962
Them white boys
ain't never seen nothing like that.

25
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:05,028
But you almost drowned, though,
you almost drowned. I told Puddin Head.

26
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,767
What you talking about? I was down, man.

27
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,673
I may have swam backwards,
but I ain't...

28
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:13,810
What's so funny, man?

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,708
I want to laugh.

30
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,916
- What's funny? Don't you wanna laugh, El?
- I can go for a chuckle or two.

31
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:23,287
- Come on, what's funny?
- You know, nothing's funny.

32
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:25,587
We just clowning.

33
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:28,959
- You know how it is.
- No, Mr. Taylor, I don't know how it is.

34
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:32,192
Maybe you should explain to me
'cause I don't know how it is

35
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,325
to get my ass whooped,

36
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:38,065
and then to get on the bus and ride home
and act like it didn't happen.

37
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:41,370
- Like it's your birthday.
- Yeah, how does that happen, exactly?

38
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,206
Come on, Coach. It was just swimming.

39
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,872
Swimming? That wasn't swimming.

40
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,677
- You know what I saw?
- What did you see?

41
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:51,651
I saw a bunch of Negroes

42
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:54,381
who thought because they were black

43
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,787
that they were better than the other people.

44
00:01:56,892 --> 00:01:57,950
Did you see that?

45
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,051
I thought I was the only one
that felt that way, you know.

46
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,756
- No, but you know also what I saw?
- What did you see?

47
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:05,298
- Some white kids was there, too.
- Talk to me.

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,766
And they thought the same thing.

49
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:12,706
They thought that because they were white
they were better than you.

50
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:14,332
And you know what?

51
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:15,842
They were.

52
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:18,344
- They proved it today.
- I thought so.

53
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:20,108
Yeah, but they cheated.

54
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:22,080
You saw him kick me, Coach!

55
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,618
You know who I think cheated,
Mr. Williamson?

56
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,050
You did.

57
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,482
You all cheated.

58
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,289
Because here you had a golden opportunity
to do something special,

59
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:37,024
but you pissed the whole thing away
'cause you wouldn't take it seriously.

60
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:39,896
- Say, man, what's happening?
- Nothing, man.

61
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:41,628
Right on, man.

62
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:46,039
But let me show you what's happening.

63
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:47,938
You see your rec right there?

64
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,807
In a couple of months, it's gonna be gone.

65
00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:52,971
You know why, Mr. Carter?

66
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:57,415
Because the people it was built for
don't care about it.

67
00:02:58,286 --> 00:02:59,981
This is your house.

68
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:03,216
And I tell you something,
my life is way too short

69
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:07,694
for me to spend my time around people
who don't care about nothing.

70
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:10,856
So you see your little
basketball court there with no hoop?

71
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:13,560
Go play life with no hoop.

72
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,899
Laugh it up, man. It's a joke.

73
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:18,472
He just playing.

74
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,539
- It's funny, ain't it, man?
- Yeah.

75
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:22,109
- Right on, man.
- Right on.

76
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,144
Give me some of that, man.

77
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:54,558
Sue. Sue.

78
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:57,461
- Elston, what you doing here?
- Hold on one minute.

79
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:00,966
Need to talk to you about something.

80
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,163
- Well, can it wait? I'm late for a meeting.
- No.

81
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:06,297
Sue, we had our first meet yesterday.

82
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,740
- I'm telling you.
- Yeah, I met your coach.

83
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:11,004
He got his work cut out for him, girl.

84
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:13,740
You came all the way down here
to tell me that?

85
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,178
No.

86
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,119
Chocolate-covered cherries.

87
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:33,129
- What do you want, Elston?
- Please take it, please.

88
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:39,136
Sue, I need you to pull some strings.

89
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,867
We need all the publicity we can get.

90
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:43,102
Sue, that's the only way
we gonna be able to keep that center open.

91
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:44,940
- Elston...
- Look, I'm telling you.

92
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:47,446
And by the way, your little brother, Hakim,

93
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:49,949
girl, he's turned
into one hell of a swimmer.

94
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:52,019
Hakim isn't supposed to be swimming.

95
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,554
Hakim is supposed to be in school.

96
00:06:55,423 --> 00:06:57,391
And he's doing that too.

97
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:01,987
Get on it.

98
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:03,462
Get on it.

99
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,231
On it!

100
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:11,197
Okay.

101
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,734
Listen to your biceps.
Listen to your biceps.

102
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,541
I wanna see those ears
right against the biceps.

103
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,775
There we go.
See your goal, do an alley oop.

104
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:25,409
Dive in, right under the ball.

105
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,650
Everything tight, arms as close as you can.
And you slice through that water.

106
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:39,465
Reach for it with everything you've got,
like it's your last bit of life.

107
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:40,591
Go.

108
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:44,294
Get to that wall
like you're right within reach of it.

109
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:47,705
You can't be scared of him.
You got the whole other side.

110
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:50,403
Look at that water,
that's your world, you own that.

111
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,413
The race ain't over
till you ain't got nothing left.

112
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,382
It ain't about being tired,
it's about being strong.

113
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:01,180
When your legs get tired,
let your heart do the rest.

114
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:03,780
Come on, Mr. Davis, bring it up,
you the anchor.

115
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:07,259
You see, when you're training,
resistance is your friend.

116
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,957
But when you're trying to race,
it's called drag.

117
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:20,134
If you cannot see your face in the mirror,
your head is too low.

118
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,607
You can go faster, Mr. Taylor.

119
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,837
All you gotta do is kick your legs.

120
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:27,745
Hey, Elston,
don't you think they can go faster?

121
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,283
They're too busy admiring themselves
in the mirror, Coach.

122
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,945
You know, I still haven't found an anchor
for my relay yet.

123
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,716
- You think we got one here?
- They all anchors.

124
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:37,724
And they gonna sink us right to the bottom.

125
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:41,284
You see, coming together
is just the start of it.

126
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,160
Yo, yo! Hey, Coach! We got a special guest.

127
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,296
Staying together, winning together,
that's success.

128
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,343
Nice of you to join us, Mr. Williamson.

129
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,111
Come on back.

130
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:01,705
Everybody come back.

131
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:04,182
For every minute you're late, that's 10 laps.

132
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:07,743
- Hey, Elston, you got a slide rule on you?
- Mine don't count that high.

133
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:11,451
Yeah, you know, I majored in Mathematics
and that's 100 laps.

134
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,960
That's 2,500 yards you gotta do.

135
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,269
- I ain't doing no 100 laps.
- I know you're not.

136
00:09:24,372 --> 00:09:25,703
- They gonna swim it for you.
- What?

137
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:29,038
You gonna sit there in that chair
and let them do your work for you

138
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:31,111
since you don't know how to show up
when you're supposed to.

139
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:33,544
We gonna start off with 2,500 yards.

140
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:35,309
That's four sets of 500.

141
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,544
The last 500
is gonna be broken up into two 50s.

142
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:40,644
The first 500 is breaststroke.

143
00:09:40,755 --> 00:09:43,189
Second 500 is gonna be freestyle.

144
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,317
Third 500, I wanna see backstroke.

145
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:49,191
Fourth 500, I wanna see a butterfly.

146
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:51,629
You either work as a team

147
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,994
or you're nothing at all.

148
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:58,806
You're your own worst enemy.

149
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,873
You got so much potential.

150
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:06,538
But you ain't gonna do none of it because
you won't get out of your own way.

151
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,907
Have a seat, son.

152
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:11,541
Okay, let's go.

153
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:22,225
I believe in them so much.

154
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,195
There's so much they can do.

155
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:31,402
Hey, dig, Coach.

156
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,531
Let them stop or I quit.

157
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:36,735
If that's what you wanna do, then go.

158
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:41,571
It's your choice,
but your team is doing your work for you.

159
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:49,489
And remember, if you walk out,
you are walking out on your life.

160
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,929
You don't wanna leave,
and I don't want you to leave.

161
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,551
Hey. Hey, little man.

162
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,058
Little man.

163
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:29,957
Time to pay up, little man.

164
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:34,899
I figure that radio I stole from that guy
must have cost a good 50 bucks.

165
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:41,374
I've no money.

166
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:44,138
You think I want ice, waterman?
Hop in the car.

167
00:11:49,617 --> 00:11:51,016
Hey, hey, wait up!

168
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:53,849
Hey, Reg. What's going on?

169
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:56,253
Your boy's got a job to do for me
to pay off his debt.

170
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:59,224
Reggie, man, look,
you don't need to do this.

171
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:02,819
- You don't have to, man.
- The boy's gotta do a delivery for us.

172
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:07,534
I gotta do this or he won't ever
leave me alone, you know that.

173
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:09,330
Time is money. Get in the car.

174
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,961
I gotta do this.

175
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:14,967
I gotta do this. I got it. I got it.

176
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:16,966
I got it, okay?

177
00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:19,840
I got it.

178
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:24,946
Frank, let me do this for him.

179
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:28,488
It's me you want, not him.

180
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:54,010
That's looks like a real nutritious dinner
right there, Miss Carter.

181
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:58,017
Well, I've got protein in the eggs,

182
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:00,644
calcium in the cream frosting,

183
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:03,451
not to mention fruit
in the fruit topping, yeah.

184
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,820
Mind if I join you?

185
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:07,921
Please.

186
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,156
Thank you.

187
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:15,661
Ma'am, can I get a piece of cake, too?

188
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:21,735
So, how's things in the big City Hall?

189
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:25,378
You win some, you lose some.

190
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:27,411
I bet.

191
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,450
So, I understand Hakim is swimming again.

192
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:36,613
I assumed that
he had your permission earlier.

193
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:38,157
No, he didn't.

194
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,588
But it's a good thing
'cause he's back in school.

195
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:50,331
- Mr. Ellis, I just...
- Come on, Sue, we're having cake together.

196
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:52,300
It's Jim.

197
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:58,101
Hakim is not much of a student.

198
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,478
Yeah, I just think he's waiting
for something to catch his attention.

199
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,448
That's all. Thank you, ma'am.

200
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:08,314
Guess I just don't know
how to get through to him. I try.

201
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:10,986
Don't know how?
You've gotten through to him.

202
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:13,458
He's back in school, right?

203
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,823
And he hates it.

204
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:17,864
But he's doing it
because he wants to make you happy.

205
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:20,592
Yeah.

206
00:14:22,637 --> 00:14:24,127
How's the cake?

207
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,900
Good.

208
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:32,744
So, Hakim's a good swimmer, huh?

209
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:35,645
Yeah, like a little tadpole.

210
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:42,679
- Well, Jim, I will make a deal with you.
- Proceed.

211
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,151
If Hakim stays in school,

212
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:49,754
he stays in the pool.

213
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:54,460
So that means we can keep
the rec open, right?

214
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:59,269
You said deal.

215
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:01,432
- You...
- I like the deal.

216
00:15:06,314 --> 00:15:07,440
Excuse me.

217
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:27,493
Mr. Jones, get out of the car.

218
00:15:27,602 --> 00:15:28,626
Come on.

219
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:31,500
Hey, baby boy,
why you so bent out of shape?

220
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:33,801
- Now!
- Coach, I can handle this.

221
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:36,502
I said they're with me, baby boy, chill.

222
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:38,238
Why you doing this?

223
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:39,836
Man, get on home.

224
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:44,008
Don't you ever come around my kids again.

225
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:47,519
Nigger, who the hell
do you think you talking to?

226
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:49,556
You don't understand, do you?

227
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:53,923
These are my kids.
They will always be my kids.

228
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:56,553
Welcome to Franklin-town, nigger.

229
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,256
I'm gonna tell you one time.

230
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:00,857
Don't you ever come around my kids again.

231
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:02,731
- You understand me?
- You stepped on the wrong toes.

232
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:03,895
We ain't done yet.

233
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,338
Come around my kids again
and watch what happens to your ass.

234
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:12,569
I'm not gonna tell you again.

235
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:16,015
That's a dead man walking.

236
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:22,413
Just get on home.

237
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,470
Come on, let's get inside.

238
00:16:52,153 --> 00:16:53,347
Mr. Jim?

239
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:56,179
Hey, what's happening?

240
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,552
I think you need to take a look at this.

241
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,673
We got what we wanted, Mr. Jim.

242
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,943
The Philadelphia Department of Recreation
is pleased to inform us

243
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:28,544
that we have been sanctioned to...

244
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:36,388
We've been sanctioned
to hold a meet right here,

245
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:38,362
at Marcus Foster Pool.

246
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,400
Jim, you keep this up, you'll be unpacking
all those boxes out there.

247
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:47,573
How did you arrange this, man?

248
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:50,075
Well, Jim, I know a lot of people, too.

249
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,439
Yeah.

250
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:54,412
But you might want to thank
that councilwoman, that pretty little girl,

251
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:56,540
when you get a chance.

252
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,277
You know what I mean.

253
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,849
Thank you, Mr. Jim. Thank you so much.

254
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:18,770
How are you?

255
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,005
Elston.

256
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:27,070
Bingo night is on Tuesday
and Easter is eight months away.

257
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:29,916
Reverend, I've been thinking.

258
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:32,451
You know, it says in John 3:16

259
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:35,579
that God so loved the world,
he gave his only begotten son.

260
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:37,247
You know it.

261
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:58,537
Look at you, all decked out.

262
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:06,819
First meet in PDR in 10 years, Jim.

263
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:11,889
Yeah, I'm just hoping that some people
show up there for them kids, you know.

264
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:15,622
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

265
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:37,575
Yeah.

266
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:52,492
There, they're coming.

267
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,828
Keep your head. Keep your head.

268
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,798
Hey, Bink, good to see you, man.
How you doing?

269
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:00,890
- How's the kids?
- You know, same old stuff.

270
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:01,990
Yeah, wife?

271
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:03,797
Yeah, same, how about you?
What's going on?

272
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:06,964
New wife, smaller than the last one
but a lot more expensive.

273
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:08,302
- Yeah.
- You're a smart man

274
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:10,070
staying married all these years...

275
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:12,702
Excuse me a second. Say, Coach Ellis.

276
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,905
Hi.

277
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:16,713
I regret to inform you that

278
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,876
some of my young men
have come down with the flu

279
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,578
on the trip down here today.

280
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:25,421
And we had the best intentions
to support this community effort of yours,

281
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:28,393
but unfortunately we are not
gonna be able to compete today.

282
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,931
- So you're saying that you're forfeiting.
- No.

283
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:37,197
We will reschedule at a different time
and, perhaps, a more appropriate location.

284
00:21:37,304 --> 00:21:41,001
What, some type of 24-hour, 14-minute flu?

285
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:43,976
You know, I bet you
they gonna feel a whole lot better

286
00:21:44,078 --> 00:21:45,739
by the time they get home. Won't they?

287
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,610
Yeah, I bet they will. Thanks for caring.

288
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:58,224
If he walks out of here, that's a forfeit.

289
00:21:58,325 --> 00:22:00,384
- They're all sick.
- No, they're leaving.

290
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:02,052
They can't compete.

291
00:22:02,162 --> 00:22:04,824
- What do you want me to do, Mr. Ellis?
- I want you to be fair.

292
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:06,923
If that happened to my boys...

293
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,695
No, it's a forfeit.

294
00:22:08,802 --> 00:22:10,235
I guess this meet is canceled.

295
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:11,736
- Good day, Mr. Ellis.
- Come on, don't do this.

296
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,204
Don't do this right now.

297
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:15,434
Come on, don't walk away from me.

298
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,100
It's a forfeit.

299
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,138
What's going on?

300
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:22,943
Where did the other team go?

301
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,245
Just some things don't change.

302
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:29,187
But thank you.

303
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:33,317
Thank you for everything you did
in trying to help us but...

304
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:36,858
I've gotta go and explain this to my kids.

305
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,610
Y'all should be proud of yourselves.

306
00:22:57,718 --> 00:22:59,618
You got a huge crowd here today.

307
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,314
You came here to compete and you won.

308
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,549
Coach.

309
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,425
What happened?

310
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:10,727
Oh, no, they're leaving now.

311
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:12,321
- What?
- Why?

312
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,866
You know why.

313
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:16,833
You can't change some people.

314
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:20,031
You know, some people
are just born messed up,

315
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,166
but I am so proud of you all.

316
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:27,439
And I want y'all to walk out of here
with your heads held high.

317
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:29,846
And tomorrow we'll come back
and we'll practice

318
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,975
and we'll act as if
none of this ever happened.

319
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:33,883
But y'all are PDR.

320
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:51,837
I can't believe they're doing this again.

321
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:30,835
This is our house, Coach!

322
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:33,812
On your mark.

323
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:49,495
This is our house, Coach!

324
00:24:50,664 --> 00:24:52,097
On your mark.

325
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:04,901
This is our house!

326
00:25:06,513 --> 00:25:07,946
On your mark.

327
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,557
This is our house, Coach.

328
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:25,825
This is our house, Coach.

329
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:27,628
This is our house, Coach.

330
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,075
He's a man, now. He's a big boy now.

331
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,581
<i>We're just so proud of Andre.</i>

332
00:25:48,689 --> 00:25:51,817
<i>He's the first person in our family</i>
<i>to learn how to swim.</i>

333
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,156
<i>This is great for our community.</i>

334
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:05,227
<i>It inspires all of us and we love having</i>
<i>the Foster Center come back.</i>

335
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:07,034
<i>It's wonderful.</i>

336
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:17,707
<i>She could always swim like a fish.</i>

337
00:26:17,818 --> 00:26:19,877
<i>She was the butterfly champ</i>
<i>at summer camp.</i>

338
00:26:21,255 --> 00:26:23,189
<i>PDR. Number one.</i>

339
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,488
<i>I'm very excited 'cause</i>
<i>I never been outside of Philly before.</i>

340
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:43,771
<i>Just three months ago,</i>
<i>these kids could barely swim.</i>

341
00:26:43,877 --> 00:26:46,107
<i>Next week, the kids of Marcus Foster Pool</i>

342
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:48,875
<i>are heading</i>
<i>to the National Swimming Championships</i>

343
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,711
<i>at the University of Baltimore.</i>

344
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:55,015
I would like to thank Coach Jim Ellis
for all he's done for our youth.

345
00:26:55,122 --> 00:26:56,817
Thank you, Councilwoman.
We really appreciate it.

346
00:26:56,924 --> 00:26:57,948
Absolutely.

347
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:00,652
Coach, why don't we go inside
so we can interview you by the pool?

348
00:27:00,761 --> 00:27:02,922
Sue, you think you might

349
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,796
get a craving for one of them
healthy slices of cake?

350
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:08,627
Maybe?

351
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:11,397
Maybe.

352
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:15,200
Tonight.

353
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:16,934
Okay.

354
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:19,105
Thanks.

355
00:27:48,508 --> 00:27:49,566
Wait.

356
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:58,910
- Get a shot of this! Get a shot of this!
- Told you, we ain't done.

357
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:03,716
I can't swim!

358
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,188
Come here.

359
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,767
Now, say something.

360
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:22,434
- Make sure you got it.
- Come on, man!

361
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,641
- Help me!
- Let him give it to him.

362
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:36,652
Elston, do something!

363
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:43,327
Let him go!

364
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,920
Let him go, Coach!

365
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,764
- He ain't worth it, man.
- Come on, help him. Come on, come on.

366
00:28:51,872 --> 00:28:53,430
Get him out of there.

367
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,439
He ain't worth it, Coach.

368
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:04,139
<i>Mired by another night of violence,</i>

369
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:06,617
<i>intruder Franklin Pierce</i>
<i>is in stable condition</i>

370
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,517
<i>at Philadelphia Memorial Hospital.</i>

371
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:13,025
<i>Now, according to police, no charges have</i>
<i>been filed against Coach Jim Ellis.</i>

372
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,616
<i>Now, all this comes on the eve</i>

373
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:17,788
<i>of what should be the biggest night</i>
<i>for the kids of Foster Rec</i>

374
00:29:17,898 --> 00:29:22,028
<i>who tomorrow leave for the National Finals</i>
<i>at the University of Baltimore.</i>

375
00:29:28,408 --> 00:29:30,899
So, I'm a big hypocrite, you know.

376
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:37,440
Turns out I'm no better than that little thug.

377
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:41,383
Tell you something, Elston. I need to quit.

378
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:45,256
Get out of these kids' way, you know.

379
00:29:47,694 --> 00:29:49,127
What?

380
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:52,392
Man, if you quit now,
you quit on them kids.

381
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:54,360
You quit on this center.

382
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:56,960
You quit on this whole community.

383
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,938
And most importantly, Jim,

384
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:02,938
you quit on yourself.

385
00:30:31,304 --> 00:30:32,931
I'm glad you came.

386
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,403
You must have seen the report.

387
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:46,150
Who are you?

388
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:50,718
Are you a con artist?

389
00:30:54,261 --> 00:30:57,128
You tricked our children into trusting you.

390
00:30:58,131 --> 00:31:02,067
You tricked this community
into trusting you.

391
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:05,070
First of all, I haven't tricked nobody.

392
00:31:05,172 --> 00:31:06,935
You know where I was?

393
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,565
I was at the police station.

394
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:14,276
And I told them that Jim Ellis
is not the type of man to hurt anybody.

395
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,347
And you know what they told me?

396
00:31:19,853 --> 00:31:22,219
That you have a record of arrest.

397
00:31:27,561 --> 00:31:28,619
Okay.

398
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,922
There you have it.

399
00:31:32,032 --> 00:31:34,330
The world isn't black and white.

400
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:37,870
When I was young, I hit an officer.

401
00:31:38,705 --> 00:31:40,730
But I had a damn good reason
for doing that.

402
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:43,002
I know, I know. You're innocent.

403
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,770
Everybody's always innocent, remember?

404
00:31:44,878 --> 00:31:47,278
I was the one
that put those innocent people away.

405
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,372
And funny how they are innocent
every time.

406
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,251
You know, out of all the people I know, I...

407
00:31:56,857 --> 00:32:00,884
I would think you would understand
that the world isn't black and white.

408
00:32:04,497 --> 00:32:06,124
You almost had me.

409
00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:12,534
You almost had me believing
that you could make a difference.

410
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:17,673
Good night, Mr. Ellis.

411
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,656
Right on.

412
00:33:34,487 --> 00:33:35,545
What?

413
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,032
On the bus.

414
00:33:53,006 --> 00:33:54,166
Hey, Jimmy.

415
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:55,769
We brothers.

416
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:04,249
Let's do it. Let's do it, man.

417
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:14,985
Good luck.

418
00:34:22,502 --> 00:34:24,163
What's happening, Coach?

419
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:44,588
You know, when I was a young man,

420
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,828
I made a lot of mistakes.

421
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,991
I made another one yesterday.

422
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,731
That's not the example I want for you.

423
00:34:56,836 --> 00:34:59,270
And I'm gonna have to pay for that.

424
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:02,273
So I've decided
I'm not gonna be coaching you

425
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,306
but I'm putting myself on suspension.

426
00:35:07,414 --> 00:35:10,349
Wait, so who's gonna coach us?

427
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:22,022
You got each other.
'Cause in the end, that's all you really have.

428
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,131
And you got your captain, Andre.

429
00:35:28,535 --> 00:35:30,935
You know what to do, Mr. Williamson.

430
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:38,209
You see, we've been chasing dreams
for many, many years.

431
00:35:39,379 --> 00:35:45,477
But tomorrow, you'll all get an opportunity
to fulfill some of those dreams.

432
00:35:49,322 --> 00:35:52,985
You and the letters
that stand for this place.

433
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:56,327
You stand for PDR.

434
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,222
But what does it mean to us?

435
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,366
Pride, determination and resilience.

436
00:36:05,004 --> 00:36:07,905
That's what's brought
all these people together.

437
00:36:08,842 --> 00:36:11,310
You've given them something to believe in.

438
00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:15,974
Because this is our community.

439
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:17,777
This is our house.

440
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:23,650
And it's built on pride,
determination and resilience.

441
00:36:25,325 --> 00:36:30,388
Just pride, determination and resilience.

442
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,724
PDR! PDR! PDR! PDR!

443
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:40,636
PDR! PDR! PDR! PDR!

444
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,173
We're gonna win for you.

PDR! PDR! PDR! PDR!

446
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,452
Go get them, brothers. Go get them.

447
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:22,813
Man, this pool is big.

448
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:24,907
It's like an ocean.

449
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,654

All day, you dig?

475
00:39:10,123 --> 00:39:12,250
Hey, focus. Don't worry about him.

476
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:13,347
Okay.

477

Good job! Hey! Yeah!

<i>Swimmers, take your mark.</i>

483
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:57,827
Come on, baby. Come on.

484
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:04,870
Come on, Willie!

485
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:06,069
Speed up.

486
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:08,412
And again.

487
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:15,312
- Go, Willie!
- Come on!

488
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:16,786
Come on!

489

<i>And Carl Walters</i>
<i>finishes third for Arlington.</i>

493
00:40:33,773 --> 00:40:36,765
<i>This gives Mercer the lead.</i>
<i>Main Line in second place.</i>

PDR! PDR!

497
00:40:51,257 --> 00:40:53,122
Come on! Come on!

498

Yes!

Yeah.

502
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:03,902
Stretch it out, stretch it out.

503
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,231
My leg!

<i>This brings us to the last race</i>
<i>of the individual competition.</i>

505

00:41:25,825 --> 00:41:27,315
Go, Andre.

509
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,458
You can do it!

510
00:41:50,683 --> 00:41:54,619
Well, boys, apparently
we got ourselves a little rivalry here.

511
00:41:56,189 --> 00:41:58,851
Now, obviously, that's not the same team
that came up to Main Line.

512
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:00,619
You realize that, right?

513
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:03,058
Killing, man.

514
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:04,151
Guys!

515
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:06,358
Guys, look!

516

<i>After completing the individual events,</i>

<i>Main Line is in first place with 101 points.</i>

<i>PDR is just five points behind with 96.</i>

520
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:24,144
<i>And Mercer is in third place with 93 points.</i>

521
00:42:26,018 --> 00:42:29,146
All right, this is what it's all about.
It's the relay.

522
00:42:29,689 --> 00:42:31,452
And we in second place.

523
00:42:32,124 --> 00:42:34,615
We can actually win this thing,
just like Walt said.

524
00:42:34,727 --> 00:42:37,525
We win this relay, we're champions again.

525
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:40,891
But we lose and they're champions.

526
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:44,795
Walt, how's that cramp?

527
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:47,497
I think I can swim, man.

528
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,040
I'm ready.

529
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,868
Sit this one out.

530
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:56,081
- Then who's gonna swim the first leg?
- I am.

531
00:42:56,182 --> 00:42:58,082
Dre, you're the anchor, man.
You can't swim first.

532
00:42:58,184 --> 00:42:59,242
Yeah, man, he's right.

533
00:42:59,352 --> 00:43:02,719
I mean, you know the anchor
has to have the fastest time, man.

534
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,981
The anchor's got to have the biggest heart.

535
00:43:07,093 --> 00:43:10,085
Reg, you're our anchor.

536
00:43:12,398 --> 00:43:14,025
You sure about that?

537
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:16,892
So, let's win this. Come on.

538
00:43:17,003 --> 00:43:18,766
- Go Main Line!
- Main Line!

539
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:20,270
That's right! Come on!

540
00:43:20,373 --> 00:43:22,307
PDR on three.

541
00:43:22,408 --> 00:43:24,308
One, two, three.

Reg, Reg. What you doing?

559
00:45:06,712 --> 00:45:08,270
Look at me, man.

560
00:45:08,648 --> 00:45:10,081
You can do this.

561
00:45:10,182 --> 00:45:11,649
You can do this.

562
00:45:53,225 --> 00:45:55,090
- Come on.
- Come on, Mr. Jones.

563
00:45:59,832 --> 00:46:01,663
Go! Go!

564
00:46:14,246 --> 00:46:16,146
I'm proud of you, Coach Ellis.

567
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,064
What happened?

568
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:17,897
I couldn't watch.

569
00:48:19,371 --> 00:48:20,929
I just couldn't.

570
00:48:32,051 --> 00:48:34,918
Win or lose, we still got our pride.
