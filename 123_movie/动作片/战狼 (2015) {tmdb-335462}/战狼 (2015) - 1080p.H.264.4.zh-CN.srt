如果这是战场

你已经身陷重围了

243
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,880
连这点警觉性都没有
If you don't have such alertness,

244
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,600
你还当什么狙击手

如果这是真正的战场

成功挖掘战壕隐藏

敌方预伏陷阱正中心降落

258
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,820
只有一个理由
there could only be one reason,

259
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,910
您带着所有部下一起叛国了

260
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,240

不是打起来就是要接吻
they either begin to flight or begin to kiss.

266

00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,530
冷锋
Leng Feng,

302
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,540
讲讲你三枪的故事吧
tell us your three-shoots story.

303
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,620
说话要谨慎啊
Be careful with your words.

304
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,540
死三八什么事都有你
Shit Rubberneck, you just can't leave things alone.

305
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,220
是史三八不是死三八
I'm Shi Rubberneck, not Shit Rubberneck.

306
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,920
这个二愣子
That idiot,

307
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,720
刚到战狼的第一天
on the very first day he came

308
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,250
就当众质问
Questioned in front of everyone

309
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,050
这么剽悍的部队
"Why is such a tough troop"

310
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,130
怎么队长是一个娘儿们
"led by a broad?"

311
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,840
后来被整了十七八次
He had been tricked for more than 17 times,

312
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,800
老实了
then he behaved.

313
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,930
说话小心点
Be careful with your words.

314
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,260
龙队是女的
Commander Long is a woman.

315
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,640
女的就是娘儿们
A woman is a broad.

316
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,280
我没说错吧
Am I wrong?

317
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,480
女人怎么了
What's the big deal being?

318
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,280
女人就不能当队长了啊
Can't a woman be a commander?

319
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,700
要我说啊
In my opinion,

320
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,770
没有龙队就没有咱们战狼
there will be no wolves without Commander Long,

321
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,650
是不是
right?

322
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,740
没错
Yes,

323
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,110
三八说得对
Rubberneck is right.

324
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,250
哎
Eh?

325
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,870
你应该领教过的
You should have already been taught a lesson.

326
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,910
要我说啊
In my opinion,

327
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,330
这种女人
what this kind of woman needs

328
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,340
就缺被男人征服

329
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,160
被什么样的男人征服啊
By which kind of man?

330
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,870
就缺我这样的男人征服
A man like me.

331
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,420
怎么征服
How?

332
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,090
怎么征服
How?

333
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,430

Ah, ah!

334

首长
Commander,

347
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,940
这可是二战期问
this is a tactic used by large formations

348
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,030
大兵团作战才使用的战术啊
during World War ll.

349
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,170
这明显是个诱饵啊

落在我们阵地上

龙小云趁着我们侵入指挥系统
When we were trying to penetrate the system,

向炮团发送了作战指令

375
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,630
我们的一个机械化步兵团

376
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,660
已经被自己的炮团歼灭了

377
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,580
有点意思
Interesting.

378
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,460
云姐

植入了一个病毒
in our operational command system.

383
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,920
如果刚才那个电话打出去

384
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,010
不出三分钟

385
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,090
炮弹就砸到这了

386
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,940
好戏才刚刚开始
The game has just begun

模仿外军特种部队的作战方式

391
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,050
研究的就是如何对付外军

假的

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,480

听到请回答
please reply if you hear this.

401
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,030
这个太假了吧
It looks really fake.

402
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,870
对方就是让我们认为这是假的
They want us to think this is a fake one,

403
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,860
才会把真的放在这
so they left the real one here.

404
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,490
搞一下不就知道了吗
Let's check it out.

405
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,950
所有人注意
Attention,all units

406
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,230

等等
Wait.

411
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,570
如果他们就是想让我们以为
What if they want us to think

412
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,040
他们会把真的放在假的里面呢
they would put the real one in the fake one?

413
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,920
你这是在怀疑龙队的指令
Are you doubting Commander Long's order?

414
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,550
我了解红军指挥官
I know the red force's commander.

415
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,340
我觉得九成是陷阱

416
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,730
执行命令
Follow the orders.

417
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,690
哎
Eh,

418

如果这真是假的
if this is a fake one,

419
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,020
战狼就输了
The wolf will be lost.

420
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,730
战狼就没输过
The wolf never loses.

421
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,110
我才刚开始喜欢你
I had just begun to like you,

422
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,990
现在我对你很失望

423
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,870

426
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,780
对他们的作战风格

427
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,580
肯定比咱们了解

428
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,580
要不我带着冷锋和三八
Shall I take Leng Feng and Rubberneck

429
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,420
在周边策应一下
and support from the perimeter?

430
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,680
嗯
Eh.

431
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,760
演习结束后
When the exercise finishes,

432
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,470
离开战狼吧
you better leave the Wolf.

433
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,330
完了 完了
We are so over.

434
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,120
我就说是假的吧

邵队
Commander Shao,

441
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:16,090
你带着部下集体殉国了
you are taking your men to die for our country together

442
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,900
这小子不错啊
He is good.

443
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,360
想办法把他挖过来
Make him one of us.

444
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,360
他是战狼中队的副队长
He is the Deputy Commander of Wolf warrior detachment

445
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,160
你一定把他给我整回来

把探路鸟收回来

是
Yes, Sir.

448
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,290
就算咱仨现在冲下去
We won't be a thing to them

449
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,460
那也不够他们塞牙缝的
even if we rush down now.

实战打的都是空包弹

我来当兵就是为了打仗

跟打过家家似的

500
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,190
打啥仗啊打仗

00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,820
在家多陪陪老婆孩子多好啊

联络最近的直升机

直升机都归红军调配

我军正和红军处于交战状态

立刻通过公共频道

523
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,870
联络红军指挥官

524

马上增援战狼中队

战狼士兵个个要老婆
Every Wolf warrior wants a wife,

537
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,800
你要我要没有那么多

538
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,040
遵守纪律能娶龙小云

541

还追啊

542
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,600
这不是玩赖吗
Is it fair?

543
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,120
这不公报私仇吗
Isn't it a revenge for personal reasons?

544
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,190
不行我要向领导汇报
That's not right. I'm going to report this to the officer.

545
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,400
刚离开原部队
You shot your old commander

546

就将老首长一枪击毙

547
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,110
我要是你连长

548

553
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,060

556
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,690
我们连长下手可黑啊

557
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,900

有实弹

559
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,610
这不是演习
This is not an exercise.

560
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,910
马上联络指挥部
Call the headquarters.

561
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,740
站住
Freeze.

562
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,350
命令部队
Inform the force

563
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,850
进入战备状态

564
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,370
有外军入境
Foreign force crossed the border.

565
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,730
请求武装直升机
Request for armed helicopters.

566
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,950
载弹支援
Live shell support needed.

567
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:47,550
退后
Fall back.

568
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,310
他们的支援来了
Their reinforcement is coming.

569
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,390
我闺女
My little princess.

570
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,190
漂亮吧
Beautiful?

571
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,590
他们回来了
They are back.

572
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,090
快上来 咱们走
Mount up. Let's roll.

573
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,140
那么
So

574
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,690
他怎么样
How was he?

575
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,140
他跟他的武器一样烂
He's as faulty as his weapon.

576
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,110
哈 哈 哈 哈
Ha ha ha ha

577
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,640
这太简单了
That was easy.

578
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,480
我觉得他们的地沟油
I'm sure their sewer will kill me

579
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,400
会比他们的士兵先杀掉我
before they actually do.

580
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,150
不要低估他们
Do not underestimate them.

581
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,370
记住 他们并没有实弹
Remember, they are unarmed.

582
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,330
就是简单的围剿一个人
A simple snatch and grab, man.

583
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,940
你应该当时就杀了他
You should've just killed him.

584
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,830
现在我们捅了马蜂窝
Now we just kicked the hornets' nest.

585
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,790
这正是我想要的
Exactly what I want it.

586
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,920
猴子 撒退计画怎么样了

一切尽在计画中 老大

589
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,130

590
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:33,340
这里是中华人民共和国领土
This is the territory of the People's Republic of China.

591

592
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,510
命令你们

看来他们动真格的了

596
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,180
这也是你的计画吗
Is this a part of your plan, too?

597
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,560
先生们
Gentlemen,

598
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,900

有点意思
That was interesting.

00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,710

652
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,840

就是为了来抓一个中国士兵

他亲自入境

和老猫同时出现

657
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,480
事情不是想象的那么简单

658
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,240
快 快 快

这种东西只有千分之一毫米
This kind of thing is only a thousandth of a millimetre big.

670
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:55,640
一旦爆炸

671
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,020
就会进入电子仪器

造成短路
And make them short circuit,

673
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,070
甚至电弧燃烧

674
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:01,900
短时问内在空气中不会消失

675
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,290
飞机无法进入

676
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,610

682
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:12,950
是
Yes, Sir.

683
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,040
我们分析
As we surmised,

684
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,750
老猫杀害了我方士兵
Tomcat killed one of our soldiers.

685
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,120
应该知道我们会封锁边境

686
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,120
所以他现在逃离的路线

687
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,380
只有这一条

688
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:23,380
这片丛林是以前战争遗留下来的雷区
This forest was a mine field in former battles,

689
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:24,880
这里遍布着大量的地雷

未爆炸弹和防伞兵倒刺钩

为避免我方人员伤亡

692

我建议使用覆盖式轰炸

693
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,540
同志们
Comrades,

看着你眼前牺牲的战友

告诉我

what is this?

697
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,130
这是战书
This is a letter of challenge.

698
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,660
是向中国军人的挑衅
The provocation to Chinese soldiers

699
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,750
再过六个小时
Six hours later,

700
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,620
敌人可能会穿越国境线
the enemies will possibly cross the border

701
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,140
逃出中国
and escape from China.

702
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,250
现在我命令你们
Now, I am giving you the order

703
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,350
把失去的尊严夺回来
to take our lost honour back.

704
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,750
如果在这个时间里
If you cannot complete your mission

705
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,270
你们没有完成任务
within the time,

706
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,760
我会调动战机
I will call for air support

707
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,180
对这片区域进行覆盖式轰炸
and carpet bomb the whole area.

708
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,480
我们将要守护的这个地方
The place we are going to protect

709
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,490
终年荒无人烟
is always desolate and uninhabited.

710
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:26,030
如果没有发生这场战斗
If this battle had not happened,

711
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:28,490
我们可能一辈子不会来到这里
we might never come here in our life.

712
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,650
这里没有青山绿水
There is no pretty views here,

713
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,570
没有金银宝藏
and there is no treasures here,

714
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,820
可是在我们军人的眼里
but in our soldiers' eyes,

715
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,790
这里是最美的地方
here is the most beautiful place,

716
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,170
因为它是中华人民共和国的国境线
because it is the border of the People's Republic of China,

717
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,670
是我们必须用生命和鲜血
It is the place that we must fight for

718
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,500
誓死捍卫的地方
with our lives and blood.

719
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,820
现在
Now,

720
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,030
让我们以军人的尊严宣誓
let's make a vow for the honour of our soldiers.

721
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,560
犯我中华者
Those who challenge China's resolve

722
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:09,690
虽远必诛
will have no safe place to hide

723
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,450

724
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,200

放倒他
Put him down,

00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:05,900
但不要杀了他
just wound him.

敌方有狙击手
