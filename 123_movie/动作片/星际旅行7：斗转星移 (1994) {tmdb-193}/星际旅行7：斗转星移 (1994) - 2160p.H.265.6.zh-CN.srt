1
00:01:32,202 --> 00:01:35,454
Senators, consider the opportunities
for the Empire.

2
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:40,126
At last, the destinies of the planets
Romulus and Remus will be united.

3
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:43,713
Shinzon of Remus
is offering us a chance

4
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:46,299
to make ourselves stronger
than ever before.

5
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:49,093
It would be madness to reject it.

6
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:53,806
I beg you not to let prejudice or politics

7
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:56,100
interfere with this alliance.

8
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:58,978
By joining Shinzon's forces with ours,

9
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:01,814
not even the Federation
will be able to stand in our way...

10
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:03,399
That's enough!

11
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,735
The decision has been made.

12
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:08,905
The military does not
dictate policy on Romulus.

13
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:13,326
The Senate has considered
Shinzon's proposal and rejected it.

14
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:16,662
He and his followers will be met with
all deliberate force

15
00:02:16,747 --> 00:02:19,749
and sent back to that black rock
they came from.

16
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:24,629
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

17
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:37,725
If you will excuse me, Praetor.

18
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:40,102
I have an appointment
with the Tholian ambassador.

19
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:41,896
Of course.

20
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:47,818
Senators, are there any others
who wish to speak?

21
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:54,033
Then I call for a vote on the motion to
open trade negotiations with Celes II.

22
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:55,785
As you know, the Reman mines

23
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:58,162
have not been filling their quotas
for months now.

24
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:01,582
I hope that you will all bear in mind
the trade committee's findings.

25
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,751
As much as we don't want...

26
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:34,865
Would someone alert security?

27
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,118
Bring back Senator Tal'Aura.

28
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:08,774
Duty.

29
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,279
A starship captain's life
is filled with solemn duty.

30
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:16,282
I have commanded men in battle.

31
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:21,245
I have negotiated peace treaties
between implacable enemies.

32
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:23,956
I have represented the Federation

33
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,626
in first contact with 27 alien species.

34
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:31,756
But none of this compares
with my solemn duty today

35
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:35,468
as best man.

36
00:04:37,012 --> 00:04:40,056
Now, I know on an occasion
such as this,

37
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,224
it is expected that I be gracious

38
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:47,188
and fulsome in my praise
on the wonders of this blessed union.

39
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:51,317
But have the two of you
considered what you are doing to me?

40
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:55,654
Of course you're happy,
but what about my needs?

41
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:58,616
This is all a damned inconvenience.

42
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:03,120
While you're happily settling in
on the Titan,

43
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:08,542
I will be training my new First Officer.
You all know him.

44
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:12,004
He's a tyrannical martinet
who will never

45
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:14,757
ever allow me to go on away missions.

46
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:18,094
That is the regulation, sir.
Starfleet Code, Section 12, Paragraph...

47
00:05:18,178 --> 00:05:20,012
- Mr. Data.
- Sir?

48
00:05:20,347 --> 00:05:21,889
- Shut up.
- Yes, sir.

49
00:05:24,643 --> 00:05:27,353
Fifteen years
I've been waiting to say that.

50
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:30,564
No, seriously.

51
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:33,943
Will, Deanna,
there's still time to reconsider.

52
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:35,319
Yes?

53
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:37,780
- No.
- No.

54
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:40,825
No? Oh, very well, then.

55
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:49,708
Will Riker, you have been
my trusted right arm for 15 years.

56
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:54,255
You have kept my course
true and steady.

57
00:05:56,091 --> 00:06:00,886
Deanna Troi, you've been my guide
and my conscience.

58
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:05,641
You've helped me recognize
the better parts of myself.

59
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:08,853
You are my family.

60
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:13,399
And in best maritime tradition,

61
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,528
I wish you both clear horizons.

62
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:21,365
My good friends, make it so.

63
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:24,577
The bride and groom.

64
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:26,579
- To the bride and groom.
- To the bride and groom.

65
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:46,765
You ever think about
getting married again?

66
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:49,810
No. Twenty-three was my limit.

67
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:54,732
Worf?

68
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:59,820
- Are you all right?
- Romulan ale should be illegal.

69
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:01,780
It is.

70
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:06,535
- That was a lovely toast.
- It was from the heart.

71
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:07,828
And you needn't worry.

72
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:10,831
I'm going to brief your new counselor
on everything she needs to know.

73
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,960
Oh, like hell you are.
You already know too much about me.

74
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,798
I take it that there will be no speeches
during the ceremony on Betazed?

75
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:22,968
No. No speeches and no clothes.

76
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:28,849
Ladies and gentlemen
and invited transgendered species,

77
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:32,853
in my study of Terran
and Betazoid conjugal rites

78
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:37,441
I've discovered it is traditional
to present the happy couple

79
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:39,318
with a gift.

80
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:43,739
Given Commander Riker's affection
for archaic musical forms,

81
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,992
I have elected to present the following
as my gift

82
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:49,620
in honor of their conjugation.

83
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,830
Conjugation!

84
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:55,209
Never saw the sun shining so bright

85
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:58,837
Never saw things going so right

86
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:02,174
Noticing the days hurrying by

87
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,262
When you're in love, my how they fly

88
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:11,267
Blue skies
Smiling at me

89
00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:13,143
Irving Berlin.

90
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:18,232
Nothing but blue skies
Do I see

91
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,467
It's tradition, Worf.

92
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:47,886
You, of all people,
should appreciate that.

93
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:49,722
I will not do it.

94
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:51,932
Won't do what, Mr. Worf?

95
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:54,310
Captain, I do not think it is appropriate

96
00:08:54,394 --> 00:08:57,771
for a Starfleet officer to appear naked.

97
00:08:58,064 --> 00:08:59,064
Oh, come now.

98
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,402
A big, handsome, strapping fellow
like you? What can you be afraid of?

99
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:12,328
Captain, I'm picking up
an unusual electromagnetic signature

100
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:13,954
from the Kolarin system.

101
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,291
- What sort of signature?
- Positronic.

102
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:27,551
It's very faint.

103
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:31,221
But I've isolated it to the third planet
in the Kolarin system.

104
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:33,515
- What do we know about it?
- Uncharted.

105
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,352
We'll have to get closer
for a more detailed scan.

106
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:37,436
Theories?

107
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,022
Since positronic signatures
have only been known to emanate

108
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:41,690
from androids such as myself,

109
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:45,569
it is logical to theorize
there is an android on Kolarus III.

110
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,322
Just what I was afraid of. Captain,

111
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:50,449
diverting to the Kolarin system

112
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:53,160
takes us awfully close
to the Romulan Neutral Zone.

113
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:59,625
It's still well on our side. I think...

114
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:05,255
I think it's worth taking a look.
Don't worry, Number One.

115
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,050
We'll still have you to Betazed
with plenty of time to spare.

116
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:09,259
Thank you, sir.

117
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:13,097
Where we will all honor
the Betazoid tradition.

118
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,059
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be in the gym.

119
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:27,820
Mr. Branson, lay in a course
for the Kolarin system, warp 5.

120
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:34,868
What do you think, Data?
A long-lost relative?

121
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,681
I'm reading six distinct
positronic signatures

122
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:58,308
spread out over a few kilometers
on the planet's surface.

123
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:00,686
What do we know
about the population of Kolarus III?

124
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,813
Isolated pockets of humanoids.

125
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:04,940
It appears to be a pre-warp civilization

126
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:07,609
at an early stage
of industrial development.

127
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:10,737
Captain, I wouldn't recommend
using the transporter.

128
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:12,948
That ion storm
doesn't look very neighborly.

129
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:15,200
It could head in our direction
without much warning.

130
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:16,410
Understood.

131
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:26,587
- Data, Mr. Worf, you're with me.
- Captain, I don't have to remind you...

132
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:29,006
I appreciate your concern, Number One.

133
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:33,218
- But I've been itching to try the Argo.
- I'll bet.

134
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,014
Captain's prerogative.
There's no foreseeable danger.

135
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,518
And your wife would never forgive me
if anything were to happen to you.

136
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,563
You have the Bridge, Mr. Troi.

137
00:12:51,923 --> 00:12:54,383
I will always be puzzled
by the human predilection

138
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:57,469
for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities.

139
00:13:03,351 --> 00:13:05,894
Over that rise, sir. Half a kilometer.

140
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:33,255
The radiant electromagnetic field
is interfering with my tricorder.

141
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,799
We are within a few meters
of the signal.

142
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,510
Fan out. Let's search around.

143
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:22,012
- It appears to be a robotic arm.
- Very astute.

144
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,349
Mr. Worf, bring it to the vehicle.

145
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:58,674
This doesn't feel right.

146
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,269
The final signature is approximately
100 meters to the north, sir.

147
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,009
It's you.

148
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:47,347
The resemblance is striking.

149
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:00,694
- Fascinating.
- Fascinating.

150
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:06,658
To the vehicle.

151
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,960
I think it's time
to try some unsafe velocities.

152
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:38,231
Why do you have a shiny head?

153
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,443
This is not the appropriate time
for a conversation.

154
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:42,569
Why?

155
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,905
Because the Captain has to
concentrate on piloting the vehicle.

156
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:46,198
- Why?
- Because...

157
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:47,324
Data!

158
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:49,701
Sorry, sir.

159
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,372
Have I said something wrong?

160
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,542
Data.

161
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:40,437
- That's negative 3, cos/bar standard.
- Valve transfer initiated.

162
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:45,317
You know, all things considered, Data,
I think you have nicer eyes.

163
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:50,530
Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

164
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,576
So what have we got, Geordi?

165
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:58,371
I'd say he has the same
internal mechanics as Data

166
00:18:58,456 --> 00:19:00,373
but not as much
positronic development.

167
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,959
The neural pathways
aren't nearly as sophisticated.

168
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:05,003
I'd say he's a prototype.

169
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:07,797
Something Dr. Soong created
prior to Data.

170
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:10,634
Do you have a name, sir?

171
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,845
I am B-4.

172
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:16,765
B-4?

173
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:20,936
Dr. Soong's penchant for whimsical
names seems to have no end.

174
00:19:22,063 --> 00:19:25,857
Can you tell us how you came to be
on the planet where we found you?

175
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:27,484
I do not know.

176
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:31,780
Do you remember anything of your life
before you were on the planet?

177
00:19:31,864 --> 00:19:36,534
No. Why does the tall man
have a furry face?

178
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:43,291
Number One, keep me informed.
And, Geordi, reassemble him.

179
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:44,501
Aye, sir.

180
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:51,174
B-4, do you know who I am?

181
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:54,427
You are me.

182
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:56,221
No.

183
00:19:57,723 --> 00:19:59,349
My name is Data.

184
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:02,435
I am your brother.

185
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:08,608
Tea, Earl Grey, hot.

186
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:16,741
Captain, you have
an Alpha Priority communication

187
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:19,244
- from Starfleet Command.
- Acknowledged.

188
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:27,377
Admiral Janeway,
how good to see you again.

189
00:20:27,586 --> 00:20:31,089
Jean-Luc. How would you like
a trip to Romulus?

190
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:35,051
- With or without the rest of the fleet?
- A diplomatic mission.

191
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:37,595
We've been invited, believe it or not.

192
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,099
Seems there's been some kind of
internal political shake-up.

193
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:43,810
The new Praetor,
someone called Shinzon,

194
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:46,229
has requested a Federation envoy.

195
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:50,108
- New Praetor?
- Here's more. He's Reman.

196
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:53,403
Believe me,
we don't understand it, either.

197
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:54,904
You're the closest ship.

198
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,198
So I want you to go and hear
what he has to say.

199
00:20:57,283 --> 00:20:59,034
Get the lay of the land.

200
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:03,621
If the Empire becomes unstable, it could
mean trouble for the entire quadrant.

201
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:04,831
Understood.

202
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:07,375
We're sending you
all the intelligence we have.

203
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,127
But it's not much.

204
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:12,130
I don't need to tell you
to watch your back, Jean-Luc.

205
00:21:12,256 --> 00:21:13,506
Hardly.

206
00:21:13,591 --> 00:21:16,134
The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans.

207
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:19,137
You seem to get
all the easy assignments.

208
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:20,889
Just lucky, Admiral.

209
00:21:20,973 --> 00:21:24,059
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.

210
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:35,779
Helmsman, lay in a new course.
Take us to Romulus. Warp 8.

211
00:21:37,073 --> 00:21:40,325
- Aye-aye, sir. Course plotted and laid in.
- Romulus?

212
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:43,161
I'm afraid The Opal Sea
will have to wait, Number One.

213
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:44,454
Engage.

214
00:21:57,468 --> 00:22:01,054
As you can see, one side of Remus
always faces the sun.

215
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:04,140
Due to the extreme temperatures
on that half of their world,

216
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:06,935
the Remans live
on the dark side of the planet.

217
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:11,189
Almost nothing is known
of the Reman homeworld,

218
00:22:11,273 --> 00:22:13,108
although intelligence scans
have proven

219
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:16,820
the existence of dilithium mining
and heavy weapons construction.

220
00:22:18,697 --> 00:22:20,573
The Remans themselves
are considered

221
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:23,576
an undesirable caste
in the hierarchy of the Empire.

222
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:26,955
But they also have a reputation
for being formidable warriors.

223
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,291
In the Dominion War, Reman troops
were used as assault forces

224
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:31,793
in the most violent encounters.

225
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:33,211
Cannon fodder.

226
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:37,006
Yeah, but how did a Reman
get to be Praetor? I don't get it.

227
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:39,342
We have to assume
he had Romulan collaborators.

228
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,635
Coup d'彋at?

229
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:42,971
The Praetor's power
has always been the Romulan fleet.

230
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:46,224
They must have been behind Shinzon
for him to have overthrown the Senate.

231
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:48,309
What have we learned about Shinzon?

232
00:22:48,394 --> 00:22:50,520
Starfleet intelligence
was only able to provide

233
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:52,814
a partial account of his military record.

234
00:22:52,898 --> 00:22:55,984
We can infer he is relatively young
and a capable commander.

235
00:22:56,068 --> 00:22:59,654
He fought 12 major engagements
in the war. All successful.

236
00:22:59,738 --> 00:23:01,447
Beyond that, we know nothing.

237
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:05,994
Well, it seems as though
we're truly sailing into the unknown.

238
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:11,541
Keep at it. Anything you can give me
will be appreciated. Dismissed.

239
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:16,254
I still can't believe the Captain
went along with a memory download.

240
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:21,092
Captain Picard agrees that the B-4
was probably designed

241
00:23:21,177 --> 00:23:24,596
with the same self-actualization
parameters as myself.

242
00:23:25,431 --> 00:23:30,351
If my memory engrams are successfully
integrated into his positronic matrix,

243
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:32,854
he should have all my abilities.

244
00:23:33,022 --> 00:23:36,316
Yeah. But he would also have
all of your memories as well.

245
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:40,445
- You feel comfortable with that?
- I feel nothing, Geordi.

246
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:43,823
It is my belief
that with my memory engrams

247
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:47,368
he'll be able to function
as a more complete individual.

248
00:23:47,453 --> 00:23:50,955
- An individual more like you, you mean?
- Yes.

249
00:23:54,627 --> 00:23:57,128
Maybe he's not supposed
to be like you, Data.

250
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,299
Maybe he's supposed to be
exactly the way he is.

251
00:24:02,218 --> 00:24:03,593
That might be so.

252
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:07,805
But I believe he should have
the opportunity to explore his potential.

253
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:12,894
Okay. We're done.

254
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:23,988
B-4, do you know where you are?

255
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:27,825
I am in a room with lights.

256
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:33,498
Can you remember our father?

257
00:24:35,251 --> 00:24:37,877
- Our father?
- Yes. Dr. Soong.

258
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,463
No.

259
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:44,175
Do you know the name of the Captain
of this vessel?

260
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:47,387
Captain... No.

261
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:53,685
Data, he's assimilating
a lot of programming.

262
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,438
Remember, he's a prototype,
a lot less sophisticated than you are.

263
00:24:57,523 --> 00:25:00,024
We just don't know if his matrix
will be able to adapt.

264
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:02,402
We really need to give him some time.

265
00:25:03,696 --> 00:25:06,531
Geordi, what purpose does this serve?

266
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,741
- What?
- This.

267
00:25:09,743 --> 00:25:11,995
That's a redundant memory port.

268
00:25:12,496 --> 00:25:16,374
Maybe the provisional memory storage
is in case his neural pathways overload.

269
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:19,210
Do you mind if I keep him here
for a while?

270
00:25:19,295 --> 00:25:20,545
Run a few diagnostics?

271
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,006
No, I do not mind.

272
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:24,966
Data.

273
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,469
No. You must remain
with Commander La Forge.

274
00:25:28,637 --> 00:25:30,930
He is going to try to help you.

275
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:44,068
Captain's Log. Stardate 56844.9.

276
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:46,988
The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus

277
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:49,991
and is waiting
at the designated coordinates.

278
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:52,702
All our hails have gone unanswered.

279
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:56,039
We've been waiting for 17 hours.

280
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:05,590
- Counselor?
- They're out there, sir.

281
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:26,027
Captain, I recommend we raise shields.

282
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:27,653
Not yet, Mr. Worf.

283
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:31,532
Captain, with all due respect
to diplomatic protocol,

284
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:34,869
the Federation Council
isn't sitting out here, we are.

285
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:38,623
Patience. Diplomacy
is a very exacting occupation.

286
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:40,917
- We will wait.
- Captain.

287
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,550
- Raising shields.
- No.

288
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:52,345
- Captain.
- Tactical analysis, Mr. Worf.

289
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:58,976
Fifty-two disruptor banks,
27 photon torpedo bays,

290
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:01,270
primary and secondary shields.

291
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,900
She's a predator.

292
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,289
We are being hailed.

293
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:22,333
On-screen.

294
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:29,048
Enterprise,

295
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:34,262
we are the Reman warbird, Scimitar.

296
00:27:35,097 --> 00:27:38,975
- Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
- I am not Shinzon.

297
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:42,270
I am his viceroy.

298
00:27:44,022 --> 00:27:46,607
We are sending transport coordinates.

299
00:27:50,446 --> 00:27:54,323
- Not very chatty.
- Away team, Transporter Room 4.

300
00:28:41,246 --> 00:28:43,748
I hope you'll forgive the darkness.

301
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:48,127
We are not comfortable in the light.

302
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:54,091
- Praetor Shinzon?
- Captain Picard.

303
00:28:56,512 --> 00:28:58,971
Jean-Luc Picard.

304
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:05,436
I'd always imagined you a little taller.
Isn't that odd?

305
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,442
Now, you may scan me
without subterfuge, Commander Data.

306
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:27,375
- You are not as we imagined you.
- No?

307
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:29,168
You are human.

308
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:37,134
Why have you asked us to come here?

309
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:41,055
Praetor?

310
00:29:41,974 --> 00:29:46,143
- I've never met a human woman before.
- I'm only half human.

311
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,730
Deanna Troi of Betazed.

312
00:29:50,691 --> 00:29:54,694
Empathic and telepathic abilities.
Ship's counselor.

313
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:59,365
All this I knew.
But I never knew you were so beautiful.

314
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:02,243
You seem quite familiar
with our personnel.

315
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:04,453
Oh, I am, Commander Riker.

316
00:30:06,915 --> 00:30:08,249
May I touch your hair?

317
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:12,837
We came to Romulus on a matter we
were assured was of great importance.

318
00:30:13,171 --> 00:30:14,839
If you have anything to say to us

319
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:18,676
as representatives of the Federation,
I suggest you do it now.

320
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:22,680
Yes. I'm sorry, Captain.

321
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:25,433
There is so much we need to talk about.

322
00:30:25,517 --> 00:30:28,269
I would be interested to know
what we are talking about.

323
00:30:28,353 --> 00:30:30,313
Unity, Captain.

324
00:30:31,148 --> 00:30:35,693
Tearing down the walls between us
to recognize that we are one.

325
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,032
I'm talking of the thing
that makes us the same.

326
00:30:42,451 --> 00:30:45,536
Peace. We want peace.

327
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:54,378
Right now you're thinking
this all sounds too good to be true,

328
00:30:54,755 --> 00:30:56,589
but you're also thinking

329
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,884
that the chance for peace
is too promising to ignore.

330
00:31:02,596 --> 00:31:03,971
Am I right?

331
00:31:07,017 --> 00:31:08,059
Yes.

332
00:31:08,644 --> 00:31:12,355
Then, perhaps it's time to add
some illumination to our discussion.

333
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:15,733
Computer, raise the lighting four levels.

334
00:31:30,165 --> 00:31:34,669
When I was very young,
I was stricken with an odd disease.

335
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,173
I developed a hyper-sensitivity to sound.

336
00:31:40,092 --> 00:31:42,843
Even the slightest whisper
caused me agony.

337
00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:44,929
No one could do anything about it.

338
00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:49,475
Finally, I was taken to a doctor who had
some experience of Terran illnesses.

339
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:52,269
And he diagnosed me
with Shalaft's Syndrome.

340
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,774
Do you know of it, Captain?

341
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:03,406
Yes.

342
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:07,618
Then you know
it's a very rare syndrome.

343
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:09,620
Genetic.

344
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,417
Apparently, all the male members
of a family have it.

345
00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:20,256
Eventually, I was treated and now
I can hear as well as you can, Captain.

346
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:24,301
I can see as well as you can.

347
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,556
I can feel everything you feel.

348
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,684
In fact,

349
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:36,439
I feel exactly what you feel.

350
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:39,483
Don't I, Jean-Luc?

351
00:32:41,987 --> 00:32:45,740
Come to dinner tomorrow on Romulus.
Just the two of us.

352
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:50,703
Or should I say, just the one of us?

353
00:33:06,344 --> 00:33:08,679
I think you'll be wanting this.

354
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,187
Until tomorrow then, Captain.
We have much to discuss.

355
00:33:20,692 --> 00:33:23,611
Computer, return lighting
to previous level.

356
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:56,143
There's no doubt, Captain.

357
00:33:56,228 --> 00:33:59,563
Right down to your aggressive
strain of Shalaft's Syndrome.

358
00:33:59,815 --> 00:34:01,190
He's a clone.

359
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:04,735
They probably used a hair follicle
or a skin cell.

360
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,323
- Why?
- I intend to find out, Number One.

361
00:34:10,408 --> 00:34:12,910
Inform Starfleet of the situation.

362
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:16,080
I need to know
where the hell he came from.

363
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:19,333
Counselor.

364
00:34:23,046 --> 00:34:26,674
We supported you, Shinzon,
when you assassinated the Senate.

365
00:34:26,758 --> 00:34:30,261
You told us the timing was perfect
for an attack on the Federation.

366
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,347
I don't understand why now you delay.

367
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:35,599
You don't have to understand.

368
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:37,560
And bringing the Enterprise here,

369
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:39,520
what possible purpose
could that serve?

370
00:34:39,604 --> 00:34:42,940
- I have a purpose.
- Then, perhaps you'll enlighten us.

371
00:34:43,024 --> 00:34:44,525
Silence, Romulan!

372
00:34:52,617 --> 00:34:56,036
You really must learn patience,
Commander.

373
00:34:57,372 --> 00:35:01,792
Spend 18 hours every day
under the lash of a Romulan guard

374
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:04,420
and you'll soon understand patience.

375
00:35:07,257 --> 00:35:08,424
Now go.

376
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,518
Commander Donatra.

377
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:22,938
Please remain.

378
00:35:32,657 --> 00:35:35,159
There's a word I want you to consider.

379
00:35:36,453 --> 00:35:40,915
Allegiance. It's something I demand
from those who serve me.

380
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,667
- Do I serve you?
- Yes.

381
00:35:44,961 --> 00:35:46,837
And, I think, faithfully.

382
00:35:47,547 --> 00:35:50,174
Commander Suran, on the other hand,

383
00:35:51,384 --> 00:35:52,927
gives me pause.

384
00:35:53,511 --> 00:35:55,679
Here's another word, Praetor.

385
00:35:57,807 --> 00:35:58,933
Trust.

386
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:04,021
Do you trust me?

387
00:36:05,315 --> 00:36:07,858
How far does that trust extend?

388
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,695
How deep does it go?

389
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:17,660
What must a commander do
to prove herself faithful to you?

390
00:36:19,454 --> 00:36:21,121
What must a woman do?

391
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:26,168
You are not a woman.

392
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,254
You are a Romulan.

393
00:36:30,423 --> 00:36:33,384
Serve me faithfully
and you will be rewarded.

394
00:36:34,803 --> 00:36:39,056
Keep those lovely eyes
on Commander Suran.

395
00:36:40,558 --> 00:36:44,061
And at the first sign of treachery...

396
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:49,692
Dispose of him?

397
00:36:51,236 --> 00:36:53,612
Then you will have proven yourself.

398
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:02,746
Now go.

399
00:37:13,258 --> 00:37:14,925
And, Commander,

400
00:37:18,013 --> 00:37:21,515
if you ever touch me again,

401
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,561
I'll kill you.

402
00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:40,260
The Romulans had somehow
gained possession of your DNA

403
00:38:40,678 --> 00:38:42,471
and I had been created.

404
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:47,017
And when I was ready,
they were going to replace you with me.

405
00:38:48,603 --> 00:38:51,688
Put a Romulan agent
at the heart of Starfleet.

406
00:38:52,107 --> 00:38:54,525
- It was a bold plan.
- What happened?

407
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:57,778
As happens frequently on Romulus,

408
00:38:58,363 --> 00:39:02,533
a new government came to power.
They decided to abandon the plan.

409
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:05,786
They were afraid
that I might be discovered

410
00:39:05,912 --> 00:39:07,871
and that it would lead to war.

411
00:39:12,669 --> 00:39:15,003
Not quite the face you remember.

412
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,173
Not quite.

413
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:21,343
A lifetime of violence will do that.

414
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:24,805
They broke my nose, my jaw.

415
00:39:25,306 --> 00:39:27,474
But so much is the same.

416
00:39:28,726 --> 00:39:29,977
The eyes.

417
00:39:30,979 --> 00:39:34,231
- Surely you recognize the eyes?
- Yes.

418
00:39:34,732 --> 00:39:37,234
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they?

419
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:41,029
And yours are so confident.

420
00:39:47,078 --> 00:39:49,621
So, I'm not as tall as you expected?

421
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:53,375
I had always hoped
I might hit two meters.

422
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:54,960
As had I.

423
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:01,758
How did you end up on Remus?

424
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,013
They sent me there to die.

425
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:11,101
How could a mere human survive
the dilithium mines?

426
00:40:12,437 --> 00:40:13,645
Not that it mattered

427
00:40:13,938 --> 00:40:17,232
as I was no longer part of their plans
against the Federation.

428
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:22,613
In those terrible depths
lived only the damned.

429
00:40:23,573 --> 00:40:25,324
Together with the Reman slaves,

430
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:28,869
I was condemned to an existence
of unceasing labor and starvation

431
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:31,914
under the brutal heel
of the Romulan guards.

432
00:40:32,457 --> 00:40:35,292
Only the very strongest
had any hope of survival.

433
00:40:36,044 --> 00:40:38,337
I was only a child when they took me.

434
00:40:39,255 --> 00:40:43,008
Then I didn't see the sun or the stars
again for nearly 10 years.

435
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:49,473
The only thing the Romulan guards
hated more than the Remans

436
00:40:50,141 --> 00:40:51,350
was me.

437
00:40:56,814 --> 00:40:58,899
But one man took pity on me.

438
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,403
The man that became my viceroy.

439
00:41:04,656 --> 00:41:07,324
He protected me
from the cruelty of the guards

440
00:41:08,493 --> 00:41:10,661
and taught me how to survive.

441
00:41:11,496 --> 00:41:15,374
And in that dark place
where there was nothing of myself,

442
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:18,502
I found my Reman brothers.

443
00:41:22,257 --> 00:41:25,592
They showed me the only true kindness
I've ever known.

444
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,303
You're doing this
to liberate the Remans?

445
00:41:28,596 --> 00:41:32,182
That is the single thought
behind everything I have done.

446
00:41:32,684 --> 00:41:36,353
From building the Scimitarat a secret
base to assembling my army.

447
00:41:36,437 --> 00:41:38,480
Finally, coming to Romulus in force.

448
00:41:39,357 --> 00:41:43,110
I knew they would never give us
our freedom. I would have to take it.

449
00:41:43,194 --> 00:41:46,363
How many Romulans died
for your freedom?

450
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:49,491
Too many.

451
00:41:49,826 --> 00:41:54,621
But the point is that finally the Empire
is realizing that there is a better way.

452
00:41:55,206 --> 00:41:57,040
And that way is peace.

453
00:42:02,714 --> 00:42:06,550
- You don't trust me.
- I have no reason to.

454
00:42:07,051 --> 00:42:08,927
You have every reason.

455
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:14,016
If you had lived my life and experienced
the suffering of my people

456
00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:16,810
you'd be standing where I am.

457
00:42:16,894 --> 00:42:18,145
And if you had lived my life

458
00:42:18,229 --> 00:42:21,189
you would understand
my responsibility to the Federation.

459
00:42:21,274 --> 00:42:26,111
I cannot allow my personal feelings
to unduly influence my decisions.

460
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:29,573
All I have are my personal feelings.

461
00:42:35,246 --> 00:42:38,123
I want to know
what it means to be human.

462
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:41,585
The Remans have given me a future.

463
00:42:42,795 --> 00:42:47,257
- But you can tell me about my past.
- I can tell you about my past.

464
00:42:49,802 --> 00:42:53,930
- Were we Picards always warriors?
- I think of myself as an explorer.

465
00:42:54,932 --> 00:42:56,892
Were we always explorers?

466
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,938
I was the first Picard
to leave our solar system.

467
00:43:02,774 --> 00:43:05,609
It caused quite a stir in the family.

468
00:43:06,194 --> 00:43:10,155
But I'd spent my youth...

469
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:15,160
Looking up at the stars, dreaming
about what was up there, about...

470
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,745
New worlds.

471
00:43:31,094 --> 00:43:33,595
I'm trying to believe you, Shinzon.

472
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:41,853
If there is one ideal that
the Federation holds most dear,

473
00:43:42,939 --> 00:43:45,023
it is that all men,

474
00:43:45,858 --> 00:43:47,943
all races, can be united.

475
00:43:49,612 --> 00:43:51,363
What better example?

476
00:43:51,906 --> 00:43:56,493
A Starfleet captain
standing in the Romulan Senate.

477
00:44:00,915 --> 00:44:05,168
Nothing would make me more proud
than to take your hand in friendship.

478
00:44:07,338 --> 00:44:08,839
In time.

479
00:44:10,591 --> 00:44:12,926
When that trust has been earned.

480
00:44:18,516 --> 00:44:21,268
Captain, we have had an unauthorized
access into the main computer.

481
00:44:21,352 --> 00:44:22,477
Source?

482
00:44:22,562 --> 00:44:24,855
It's gonna take some time
to figure that out, Captain.

483
00:44:24,939 --> 00:44:28,150
The data stream was re-routed
through sub-stations all over the ship.

484
00:44:28,234 --> 00:44:32,529
- What programs were accessed?
- That's what I can't figure out.

485
00:44:32,989 --> 00:44:35,240
It's mostly just basic stellar cartography.

486
00:44:35,366 --> 00:44:37,576
Star charts, communications protocols,

487
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,327
some uplinks
from colony tracking stations.

488
00:44:39,412 --> 00:44:41,246
It's not even restricted material.

489
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,082
Nevertheless, we must learn the source.
Keep me informed.

490
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:46,293
Captain, there's something else.

491
00:44:47,712 --> 00:44:50,881
I was reviewing the sensor logs.
Look at this.

492
00:44:52,049 --> 00:44:53,300
When the Scimitarde-cloaked,

493
00:44:53,384 --> 00:44:57,053
there was a momentary spike
in the tertiary EM band. There.

494
00:44:57,763 --> 00:45:01,224
You're not going to believe this.
It's thalaron.

495
00:45:05,563 --> 00:45:08,231
I thought thalaron radiation
was theoretical.

496
00:45:08,316 --> 00:45:11,818
Which is why our initial scans didn't
pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.

497
00:45:11,903 --> 00:45:14,154
Thalaron research
was banned in the Federation

498
00:45:14,238 --> 00:45:16,114
because of its biogenic properties.

499
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:20,243
It has the ability to consume organic
material at the subatomic level.

500
00:45:20,536 --> 00:45:24,414
I can't overestimate the danger
of thalaron radiation, Jean-Luc.

501
00:45:24,665 --> 00:45:27,209
A microscopic amount could kill
every living thing

502
00:45:27,293 --> 00:45:29,002
on this ship in a matter of seconds.

503
00:45:29,086 --> 00:45:31,087
I understand. Keep on it.

504
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:35,258
I want to know what he has
and how we can neutralize any threat.

505
00:45:35,635 --> 00:45:37,093
I need options.

506
00:45:50,107 --> 00:45:53,235
This was a mistake.
We're wasting time.

507
00:45:54,487 --> 00:45:56,404
My time.

508
00:45:57,782 --> 00:45:59,741
And I shall spend it how I choose.

509
00:45:59,867 --> 00:46:02,369
Do not forget our mission, Shinzon.

510
00:46:03,538 --> 00:46:05,914
We must act. Now.

511
00:46:12,171 --> 00:46:14,297
We'll return to the Scimitar.

512
00:46:16,008 --> 00:46:18,176
I was merely curious about him.

513
00:46:33,484 --> 00:46:34,693
Come.

514
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:38,863
Beverly, come in.

515
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,536
Remember him?

516
00:46:47,832 --> 00:46:51,668
- He was a bit cocky, as I recall.
- He was a damned fool.

517
00:46:52,169 --> 00:46:55,797
Selfish. Ambitious.
Very much in need of seasoning.

518
00:46:56,841 --> 00:46:58,800
He turned out all right.

519
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:04,347
I really wanted to believe Shinzon.

520
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:10,270
But this thalaron radiation
just can't be explained away.

521
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,568
Whatever he's after, it isn't peace.

522
00:47:17,612 --> 00:47:20,030
Is he very much the way you were?

523
00:47:23,701 --> 00:47:24,868
Oh, yes.

524
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,538
- Data to Captain Picard.
- Go ahead, Data.

525
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:29,664
Captain,

526
00:47:29,749 --> 00:47:33,918
Geordi and I have identified the source
of the unauthorized computer access.

527
00:47:34,253 --> 00:47:37,464
And I believe we have found a way
to gain a tactical advantage.

528
00:47:37,548 --> 00:47:38,882
On my way.

529
00:47:52,188 --> 00:47:53,271
Will?

530
00:47:54,649 --> 00:47:58,443
As ship's counselor,
I recommend you get some sleep.

531
00:48:00,571 --> 00:48:02,072
Some honeymoon.

532
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:08,244
Come to bed.

533
00:48:10,873 --> 00:48:12,082
Imzadi.

534
00:48:36,357 --> 00:48:37,565
Imzadi.

535
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,445
He can never know you as I can.

536
00:48:43,072 --> 00:48:45,198
He can never touch you as I can.

537
00:48:45,282 --> 00:48:48,451
- This isn't real!
- Then feel my lips.

538
00:48:56,961 --> 00:48:58,628
I'm with you, imzadi.

539
00:48:59,922 --> 00:49:01,965
I'll always be with you now.

540
00:49:03,426 --> 00:49:05,844
- This isn't real!
- Deanna, what's the matter?

541
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,178
- No!
- Deanna?

542
00:49:07,263 --> 00:49:09,973
- Deanna!
- No!

543
00:49:14,353 --> 00:49:16,354
The bond has been broken.

544
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,151
Find her again.

545
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:26,489
Praetor,

546
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:29,200
we've received the transponder signal.

547
00:49:40,254 --> 00:49:44,507
It's accelerating.
You have no more time for games.

548
00:49:49,138 --> 00:49:50,847
Have the doctors prepare.

549
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,404
Transport.

550
00:50:15,623 --> 00:50:17,373
Begin the download.

551
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:37,560
Tea, hot.

552
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:55,995
Aside from slightly elevated levels
of adrenalin and serotonin,

553
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,956
you're perfectly normal.

554
00:51:02,086 --> 00:51:05,255
Deanna, can you describe it?

555
00:51:05,756 --> 00:51:07,090
It was...

556
00:51:09,677 --> 00:51:11,427
It was a violation.

557
00:51:12,596 --> 00:51:17,183
Shinzon's viceroy seems to have
the ability to reach into my thoughts.

558
00:51:17,768 --> 00:51:21,271
I've become a liability.
I request to be relieved of my duties.

559
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,273
Permission denied.

560
00:51:24,275 --> 00:51:27,777
If you can endure more of
these assaults, I need you at my side.

561
00:51:27,903 --> 00:51:29,529
Now more than ever.

562
00:51:29,947 --> 00:51:32,448
The Enterprise
is far from Federation space...

563
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:36,953
Worf, shields up!

564
00:51:48,424 --> 00:51:49,966
Hello, Jean-Luc.

565
00:51:51,677 --> 00:51:54,262
Why am I here?
Why have you done this?

566
00:51:54,805 --> 00:51:56,264
I was lonely.

567
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:11,446
- What are you going to do?
- I need a sample of your blood.

568
00:52:12,865 --> 00:52:17,535
What is it your Borg friends say?
"Resistance is futile."

569
00:52:24,877 --> 00:52:27,086
Oh, yes, the android.

570
00:52:28,213 --> 00:52:33,217
- The bait you couldn't refuse.
- All of this so you could capture me?

571
00:52:34,178 --> 00:52:36,054
Don't be so vain.

572
00:52:37,973 --> 00:52:41,559
After we found it,
we had to make a few modifications.

573
00:52:42,061 --> 00:52:45,688
An extra memory port,
a hidden transponder.

574
00:52:45,898 --> 00:52:49,525
I've now gained access
to Starfleet's communications protocol.

575
00:52:50,027 --> 00:52:53,321
I now know the exact location
of your entire fleet.

576
00:52:55,074 --> 00:52:58,076
- You may go.
- Where?

577
00:53:00,788 --> 00:53:02,372
Out of my sight.

578
00:53:06,877 --> 00:53:08,461
What is all this about?

579
00:53:08,545 --> 00:53:12,215
It's about destiny, Picard.

580
00:53:12,549 --> 00:53:16,010
- It's about a Reman outcast.
- You're not Reman!

581
00:53:16,095 --> 00:53:20,223
And I'm not quite human. So what am I?

582
00:53:21,225 --> 00:53:25,561
My life is meaningless
as long as you're still alive.

583
00:53:27,481 --> 00:53:29,440
What am I while you exist?

584
00:53:30,442 --> 00:53:33,236
A shadow? An echo?

585
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:36,155
If your issues are with me,
then deal with me.

586
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,659
This has nothing to do with my ship.
Nothing to do with the Federation.

587
00:53:39,743 --> 00:53:41,577
But it does.

588
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:45,248
We will no longer
bow before anyone as slaves.

589
00:53:45,332 --> 00:53:49,085
Not the Romulans,
and not your mighty Federation.

590
00:53:49,753 --> 00:53:53,006
We are a race bred for war.

591
00:53:54,717 --> 00:53:56,175
And conquest.

592
00:53:56,343 --> 00:53:59,345
Are you ready to plunge
the entire quadrant into war

593
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,306
to satisfy your own personal demons?

594
00:54:02,683 --> 00:54:05,852
It amazes me
how little you know yourself.

595
00:54:05,936 --> 00:54:09,480
- I'm incapable of such an act.
- You are me.

596
00:54:13,485 --> 00:54:18,489
The same noble Picard blood
runs through our veins.

597
00:54:20,743 --> 00:54:24,037
Had you lived my life,
you'd be doing exactly as I am.

598
00:54:25,205 --> 00:54:29,625
So look in the mirror. See yourself.

599
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,630
Consider that, Captain.

600
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,885
I can think of no greater torment for you.

601
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:47,351
Shinzon.

602
00:54:48,729 --> 00:54:50,938
I'm a mirror for you as well.

603
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,694
Not for long, Captain.

604
00:54:57,654 --> 00:54:59,447
I'm afraid you won't survive to witness

605
00:54:59,531 --> 00:55:03,242
the victory of the echo over the voice.

606
00:55:20,511 --> 00:55:22,261
His cloak is perfect.

607
00:55:22,346 --> 00:55:25,723
No tachyon emissions,
no residual antiprotons.

608
00:55:26,016 --> 00:55:28,434
Keep at it, Geordi. Find a way in.

609
00:55:38,946 --> 00:55:41,864
Praetor Shinzon needs the prisoner.

610
00:55:52,501 --> 00:55:55,837
- About time, Mr. Data.
- My mission was a success, sir.

611
00:55:57,464 --> 00:55:59,924
I've located the source of the radiation.

612
00:56:00,217 --> 00:56:03,553
This entire ship
is essentially a thalaron generator.

613
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,472
Its power relays lead
to an activation matrix on the Bridge.

614
00:56:06,557 --> 00:56:08,891
- It's a weapon.
- It would appear so.

615
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:10,351
What about the download?

616
00:56:10,435 --> 00:56:13,146
Shinzon believes he has
our communication protocols.

617
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:16,440
They will give him inaccurate locations
for all Starfleet vessels.

618
00:56:16,525 --> 00:56:18,192
- Good work.
- Sir.

619
00:56:21,613 --> 00:56:25,658
Geordi supplied me with a prototype
for the Emergency Transport Unit.

620
00:56:27,077 --> 00:56:30,413
I recommend you use this, sir,
to return to the Enterprise.

621
00:56:30,914 --> 00:56:34,250
- It'll only work for one of us.
- Yes, sir.

622
00:56:42,134 --> 00:56:44,093
We'll find a way off together.

623
00:56:57,524 --> 00:56:59,692
It is time for the procedure.

624
00:57:15,042 --> 00:57:17,043
Move, puny human animal.

625
00:57:18,879 --> 00:57:20,713
A bit less florid, Data.

626
00:57:51,995 --> 00:57:53,287
Kill him!

627
00:58:05,968 --> 00:58:07,093
This way, sir.

628
00:58:07,177 --> 00:58:10,429
There is a shuttlebay
94 meters from our current position.

629
00:58:28,156 --> 00:58:31,534
- There it is, sir.
- Go!

630
00:58:59,896 --> 00:59:01,022
Data!

631
00:59:01,898 --> 00:59:04,817
It appears to have
an encrypted security system.

632
00:59:04,901 --> 00:59:07,653
Alacrity would be appreciated,
Commander!

633
00:59:07,738 --> 00:59:10,364
Reman is a most complex language
with pictographs

634
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:11,991
representing certain verb roots...

635
00:59:12,075 --> 00:59:15,745
While I find that fascinating, Data,
we really need that door open!

636
00:59:54,576 --> 00:59:58,829
According to the ship's manifest,
they're Scorpion-class attack fliers.

637
01:00:16,807 --> 01:00:20,851
- Data, what do you imagine this is?
- Port thruster, sir.

638
01:00:20,936 --> 01:00:23,312
Would you like me to drive, sir?

639
01:00:36,034 --> 01:00:38,452
Data,
can you open the shuttlebay doors?

640
01:00:38,537 --> 01:00:40,788
Negative, sir.
They've erected a force field

641
01:00:40,872 --> 01:00:42,123
around the external portholes.

642
01:00:42,207 --> 01:00:45,334
Well, then, only one way to go.

643
01:00:54,803 --> 01:00:57,471
Do you think
this is a wise course of action, sir?

644
01:00:57,556 --> 01:00:59,807
We're about to find out, Data.

645
01:01:00,225 --> 01:01:02,560
Power up the disruptors.

646
01:01:02,644 --> 01:01:05,020
- Ready, Captain.
- Fire.

647
01:01:44,227 --> 01:01:45,895
Tractor beam, now!

648
01:01:48,899 --> 01:01:50,941
Worf, lock on transporters.

649
01:01:58,867 --> 01:02:00,534
I have them, sir.

650
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,338
This has gone far enough.

651
01:02:12,422 --> 01:02:15,966
I thought we'd discussed patience,
Commander.

652
01:02:16,051 --> 01:02:17,551
Mine is wearing thin.

653
01:02:18,094 --> 01:02:20,638
We supported you
because you promised action.

654
01:02:20,722 --> 01:02:22,431
And yet, you delay.

655
01:02:25,143 --> 01:02:27,603
The Enterprise is immaterial.

656
01:02:27,687 --> 01:02:30,773
It won't even make it out
of the Neutral Zone.

657
01:02:31,775 --> 01:02:33,484
And in two days

658
01:02:33,568 --> 01:02:37,780
the Federation will be crippled
beyond repair.

659
01:02:37,864 --> 01:02:39,949
Does that satisfy you?

660
01:02:41,243 --> 01:02:42,952
For the moment.

661
01:02:43,036 --> 01:02:44,411
And when I return,

662
01:02:44,496 --> 01:02:47,748
you and I shall have a little talk

663
01:02:47,832 --> 01:02:50,668
about showing proper respect.

664
01:02:56,424 --> 01:02:58,634
What's happening to his face?

665
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:07,226
Commander, a moment.

666
01:03:11,022 --> 01:03:14,900
Are you truly prepared
to have your hands drenched in blood?

667
01:03:14,985 --> 01:03:17,486
He's not planning to defeat Earth.

668
01:03:18,029 --> 01:03:20,072
He's planning its annihilation.

669
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:26,036
And his sins will mark us
and our children for generations.

670
01:03:31,668 --> 01:03:35,212
The more I studied his DNA,
the more confusing it got.

671
01:03:35,297 --> 01:03:37,756
Finally,
I could come to only one conclusion.

672
01:03:37,841 --> 01:03:40,968
Shinzon was created
with temporal RNA sequencing.

673
01:03:41,052 --> 01:03:43,137
He was designed
so that at a certain point

674
01:03:43,221 --> 01:03:45,598
his aging process could be accelerated

675
01:03:45,682 --> 01:03:47,224
to reach your age more quickly.

676
01:03:47,309 --> 01:03:50,227
He was engineered
to skip 30 years of his life.

677
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,272
But when the temporal sequencing
wasn't activated,

678
01:03:53,356 --> 01:03:56,275
his cellular structure
started breaking down.

679
01:03:56,359 --> 01:03:57,776
He's dying.

680
01:03:58,695 --> 01:03:59,903
Dying?

681
01:04:01,865 --> 01:04:04,283
Can anything be done for him?

682
01:04:04,367 --> 01:04:06,201
Nothing, except a complete transfusion

683
01:04:06,286 --> 01:04:09,038
from the only donor
with compatible DNA.

684
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:11,206
You.

685
01:04:16,046 --> 01:04:20,549
- How long does he have?
- I can't say for sure.

686
01:04:20,717 --> 01:04:23,844
But the rate of decay
seems to be accelerating.

687
01:04:27,807 --> 01:04:29,725
Then he'll come for me.

688
01:04:57,045 --> 01:04:58,420
Brother,

689
01:04:58,755 --> 01:05:01,840
- I cannot move.
- No.

690
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:06,512
I have only activated your cognitive
and communication subroutines.

691
01:05:06,721 --> 01:05:08,222
Why?

692
01:05:08,306 --> 01:05:12,101
- Because you are dangerous.
- Why?

693
01:05:12,185 --> 01:05:14,353
You have been
programmed to gather information

694
01:05:14,437 --> 01:05:16,939
that can be used against this ship.

695
01:05:17,607 --> 01:05:20,943
I do not understand.

696
01:05:22,487 --> 01:05:23,654
I know.

697
01:05:27,951 --> 01:05:31,995
Do you know anything about
Shinzon's plans against the Federation?

698
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:34,623
No.

699
01:05:35,709 --> 01:05:39,712
Do you have any knowledge
of the tactical abilities of his ship?

700
01:05:40,171 --> 01:05:41,255
No.

701
01:05:42,716 --> 01:05:44,466
Can I move now?

702
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,802
No.

703
01:05:50,473 --> 01:05:53,016
What are you doing?

704
01:05:53,101 --> 01:05:57,146
- I must deactivate you.
- For how long?

705
01:05:59,691 --> 01:06:01,233
Indefinitely.

706
01:06:03,319 --> 01:06:04,820
How long is...

707
01:06:12,704 --> 01:06:14,538
A long time, brother.

708
01:06:16,416 --> 01:06:19,168
It's called a cascading biogenic pulse.

709
01:06:19,502 --> 01:06:21,587
The unique properties
of thalaron radiation

710
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:24,590
allow the energy beam
to expand almost without limit.

711
01:06:24,674 --> 01:06:28,844
Depending on its radiant intensity,
it could encompass a ship

712
01:06:29,846 --> 01:06:31,847
or a planet.

713
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:36,894
He would only have built a weapon
of such scope

714
01:06:36,978 --> 01:06:38,395
for one reason.

715
01:06:39,981 --> 01:06:43,776
- He's going after Earth.
- How can you be certain?

716
01:06:44,778 --> 01:06:47,154
I know how he thinks.

717
01:06:47,238 --> 01:06:50,491
Destroy humanity,
you cripple the Federation.

718
01:06:50,575 --> 01:06:55,329
- The Romulans invade.
- No way of penetrating his cloak?

719
01:06:55,413 --> 01:06:56,455
No.

720
01:06:58,249 --> 01:07:01,251
So he could pass within 10 meters
of every ship in Starfleet

721
01:07:01,336 --> 01:07:03,212
and they'd never know.

722
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:07,800
We do have one advantage, though.

723
01:07:07,884 --> 01:07:10,427
He needs your blood to live.

724
01:07:10,512 --> 01:07:14,890
- He might come after you first.
- I'm counting on it.

725
01:07:14,974 --> 01:07:17,142
We've been ordered to Sector 10-45.

726
01:07:17,227 --> 01:07:19,520
Our fleet has been diverted
to meet us there.

727
01:07:19,604 --> 01:07:23,232
- Strength in numbers.
- Yes, at least that's what we hope.

728
01:07:24,025 --> 01:07:26,860
He must not be allowed
to use that weapon.

729
01:07:28,071 --> 01:07:30,531
All other concerns are secondary.

730
01:07:34,911 --> 01:07:36,286
You understand me?

731
01:07:42,627 --> 01:07:43,961
Yes, sir.

732
01:07:46,881 --> 01:07:50,425
All hands, battle stations.

733
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:06,692
Initiate the force field.

734
01:08:26,379 --> 01:08:28,672
Captain's Personal Log, supplemental.

735
01:08:28,756 --> 01:08:31,633
We're heading toward Federation space
at maximum warp.

736
01:08:31,843 --> 01:08:33,093
The crew has responded

737
01:08:33,177 --> 01:08:35,846
with the dedication
I've come to expect of them.

738
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:39,975
Like a thousand other commanders
on a thousand other battlefields,

739
01:08:40,059 --> 01:08:41,852
I wait for the dawn.

740
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,542
How long?

741
01:09:08,671 --> 01:09:10,339
A matter of hours.

742
01:09:13,092 --> 01:09:15,469
We must begin the procedure now.

743
01:09:21,225 --> 01:09:23,685
How long until we reach the Rift?

744
01:09:25,521 --> 01:09:27,064
Seven minutes.

745
01:09:48,086 --> 01:09:50,545
Data, what's our current position?

746
01:09:54,884 --> 01:09:57,344
How soon until we reach the fleet?

747
01:09:58,054 --> 01:09:59,388
At our current velocity,

748
01:09:59,472 --> 01:10:03,600
we will arrive at Sector 10-45
in approximately 40 minutes, sir.

749
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,445
"For now we see but
through a glass, darkly."

750
01:10:16,531 --> 01:10:19,574
- Sir?
- He said he is a mirror.

751
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:23,161
- Of you, sir?
- Yes.

752
01:10:25,415 --> 01:10:27,165
I do not agree.

753
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:30,127
Although you share
the same genetic structure,

754
01:10:30,211 --> 01:10:33,714
the events of your life
have created a unique individual.

755
01:10:33,798 --> 01:10:35,966
If I had lived his life,

756
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:39,344
is it possible that
I would have rejected my humanity?

757
01:10:39,429 --> 01:10:41,930
The B-4 is physically identical to me

758
01:10:42,015 --> 01:10:44,850
although his neural pathways
are not as advanced.

759
01:10:44,934 --> 01:10:48,103
But even if they were,
he would not be me.

760
01:10:48,646 --> 01:10:52,816
- How can you be sure?
- I aspire, sir, to be better than I am.

761
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:57,779
B-4 does not. Nor does Shinzon.

762
01:11:00,783 --> 01:11:03,076
We are passing through
the Bassen Rift, sir.

763
01:11:03,161 --> 01:11:05,620
The projection will return
when we have cleared it.

764
01:11:05,705 --> 01:11:08,874
It's interfering with our uplink
from Starfleet cartography?

765
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:12,252
The Rift affects all long-range...

766
01:11:13,629 --> 01:11:15,464
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers.

767
01:11:21,888 --> 01:11:24,389
Target weapons systems and shields.

768
01:11:24,932 --> 01:11:27,768
I don't want the Enterprise destroyed.

769
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:56,505
Can you learn to see in the dark,
Captain?

770
01:11:57,507 --> 01:11:58,757
Report.

771
01:11:59,759 --> 01:12:01,718
He's firing from the cloak.
We can't get a lock.

772
01:12:01,803 --> 01:12:03,720
He disabled our warp drive
with his first shot.

773
01:12:03,805 --> 01:12:05,597
We only have impulse, Captain.

774
01:12:05,681 --> 01:12:08,141
Mr. Worf, prepare
a full phaser spread, zero elevation.

775
01:12:08,226 --> 01:12:09,768
All banks on my mark.

776
01:12:09,852 --> 01:12:12,437
Scan for shield impacts.
Stand by photon torpedoes.

777
01:12:12,522 --> 01:12:13,814
Aye, sir.

778
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:15,774
Fire!

779
01:12:26,744 --> 01:12:28,745
You're too slow, old man.

780
01:12:30,331 --> 01:12:32,874
Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

781
01:12:49,392 --> 01:12:51,434
We are losing dorsal shields.

782
01:12:51,519 --> 01:12:53,645
Full axis rotation to port!

783
01:12:53,729 --> 01:12:55,647
Fire all ventral phasers.

784
01:13:07,535 --> 01:13:09,870
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

785
01:13:10,246 --> 01:13:13,498
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon.
Get the shields online, Geordi.

786
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:15,125
Already on it.

787
01:13:16,252 --> 01:13:18,503
Counselor Troi, report to the Bridge.

788
01:13:18,588 --> 01:13:21,882
Captain, we are being hailed.

789
01:13:22,675 --> 01:13:23,925
On-screen.

790
01:13:26,095 --> 01:13:27,762
Captain Picard,

791
01:13:30,016 --> 01:13:32,601
will you join me in your Ready Room?

792
01:13:50,453 --> 01:13:52,746
You can't trace
my holographic emitters, Captain,

793
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:56,833
so don't bother.
And you can't contact Starfleet.

794
01:13:56,918 --> 01:13:59,586
It's just the two of us now, Jean-Luc.

795
01:14:00,171 --> 01:14:01,671
As it should be.

796
01:14:02,131 --> 01:14:06,218
- Why are you here?
- To accept your surrender.

797
01:14:07,136 --> 01:14:09,971
I can clearly destroy you at any time.

798
01:14:11,098 --> 01:14:14,851
Lower your shields and allow me
to transport you to my ship.

799
01:14:15,311 --> 01:14:17,103
And the Enterprise?

800
01:14:18,814 --> 01:14:22,317
I have little interest
in your quaint vessel, Captain.

801
01:14:23,277 --> 01:14:25,070
Look at me, Shinzon.

802
01:14:28,032 --> 01:14:31,534
Your heart, your hands,

803
01:14:31,744 --> 01:14:34,454
your eyes are the same as mine.

804
01:14:35,206 --> 01:14:39,251
The blood pumping within you,
the raw material is the same.

805
01:14:39,335 --> 01:14:41,169
We have the same potential.

806
01:14:41,587 --> 01:14:45,257
- That's the past, Captain.
- It can be the future.

807
01:14:46,008 --> 01:14:47,884
Buried deep within you,

808
01:14:47,969 --> 01:14:50,095
beneath all the years of pain and anger,

809
01:14:50,179 --> 01:14:52,681
there is something
that has never been nurtured,

810
01:14:52,765 --> 01:14:56,768
the potential
to make yourself a better man

811
01:14:56,852 --> 01:14:59,562
and that is what it is to be human.

812
01:14:59,647 --> 01:15:02,190
To make yourself more than you are.

813
01:15:05,194 --> 01:15:06,444
Oh, yes.

814
01:15:07,989 --> 01:15:09,364
I know you.

815
01:15:11,742 --> 01:15:14,619
There was a time
you looked at the stars

816
01:15:14,704 --> 01:15:16,913
and dreamed of what might be.

817
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:20,917
Childish dreams, Captain.

818
01:15:21,002 --> 01:15:24,504
Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus.

819
01:15:25,381 --> 01:15:27,716
I am what you see now.

820
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,844
I see more than that.
I see what you could be.

821
01:15:30,928 --> 01:15:34,264
The man who is Shinzon of Remus
and Jean-Luc Picard

822
01:15:34,348 --> 01:15:37,726
could never exterminate
the population of an entire planet.

823
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:39,728
He's better than that.

824
01:15:40,563 --> 01:15:43,023
He is what his life has made him.

825
01:15:43,107 --> 01:15:47,277
And what will you do with that life?
Waste it in a blaze of hatred?

826
01:15:48,154 --> 01:15:50,071
There is a better way.

827
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,198
It's too late.

828
01:15:52,283 --> 01:15:55,994
Never. You still have a choice.
Make the right one now.

829
01:15:56,078 --> 01:16:00,582
- I can't fight what I am.
- Yes, you can.

830
01:16:03,919 --> 01:16:06,921
I'll show you my true nature.

831
01:16:07,423 --> 01:16:09,466
Our nature.

832
01:16:10,593 --> 01:16:12,093
And as Earth dies, remember:

833
01:16:12,178 --> 01:16:17,098
I will always,
forever be Shinzon of Remus.

834
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:21,186
And my voice shall echo through time
long after

835
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:25,106
yours has faded to a dim memory.

836
01:16:46,712 --> 01:16:49,506
Two ships de-cloaking, sir. Romulan.

837
01:17:02,019 --> 01:17:03,228
Captain.

838
01:17:08,442 --> 01:17:11,486
Just when I thought
this couldn't get any worse.

839
01:17:12,655 --> 01:17:14,447
We are being hailed.

840
01:17:15,741 --> 01:17:17,325
On-screen.

841
01:17:19,662 --> 01:17:23,581
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra
of the warbird Valdore.

842
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:25,708
Might we be of assistance?

843
01:17:27,837 --> 01:17:29,254
Assistance?

844
01:17:29,338 --> 01:17:32,924
The Empire considers this
a matter of internal security.

845
01:17:33,509 --> 01:17:35,927
We regret you've become involved.

846
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:41,516
Commander, when this is over,
I owe you a drink.

847
01:17:42,518 --> 01:17:45,645
Romulan ale, Captain. Let's get to work.

848
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:47,522
You heard the lady.

849
01:17:48,023 --> 01:17:49,357
Let's go to work.

850
01:18:02,371 --> 01:18:06,499
Mr. Worf, coordinate our attack
with the Valdore Tactical Officer.

851
01:18:06,584 --> 01:18:08,793
Triangulate all fire
on any shield impacts.

852
01:18:08,878 --> 01:18:09,961
Aye, sir.

853
01:18:19,597 --> 01:18:21,514
Aft shields down to 40%.

854
01:18:21,599 --> 01:18:24,809
Keep our bow on the Scimitar.
Auxiliary power to forward shields.

855
01:18:24,894 --> 01:18:26,227
Aye, sir.

856
01:18:35,404 --> 01:18:39,407
Target the flanking warbird.
All forward disruptor banks on my mark.

857
01:18:59,386 --> 01:19:02,889
- Forward shields down to 10%.
- Bring us about.

858
01:19:12,316 --> 01:19:16,861
Drop cloak on the aft port quadrant.
Prepare for full emergency stop.

859
01:19:16,946 --> 01:19:19,113
- What?
- You heard me!

860
01:19:28,457 --> 01:19:33,169
He's losing his cloak.
Stand by all forward disruptor banks.

861
01:19:36,257 --> 01:19:38,007
She's almost on us.

862
01:19:40,344 --> 01:19:41,719
Not yet.

863
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:48,476
- Praetor.
- Full stop. Fire!

864
01:20:10,249 --> 01:20:13,001
Restore the aft cloak
and bring us about.

865
01:20:16,005 --> 01:20:19,215
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait,
Captain.

866
01:20:19,758 --> 01:20:22,510
- You have life support?
- For the moment.

867
01:20:23,178 --> 01:20:26,180
- But we're dead in the water.
- Understood.

868
01:20:35,858 --> 01:20:37,692
We're losing structural integrity

869
01:20:37,776 --> 01:20:40,820
on Decks 12 through 17,
sections 4 through 10.

870
01:20:43,824 --> 01:20:46,117
Emergency Force fields are holding.

871
01:20:46,201 --> 01:20:49,871
Evacuate those decks.
Re-route field power to forward shields.

872
01:20:53,334 --> 01:20:55,335
Captain,

873
01:20:55,419 --> 01:20:57,712
I think I may have a way to find them.

874
01:21:00,382 --> 01:21:05,011
Prepare for a lateral run,
all starboard disruptors.

875
01:21:12,436 --> 01:21:13,895
What is it?

876
01:21:15,064 --> 01:21:16,397
What is it?

877
01:21:18,525 --> 01:21:19,901
She's here.

878
01:21:50,349 --> 01:21:52,684
He's resisting me.

879
01:22:06,073 --> 01:22:07,115
No!

880
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:12,453
Remember me?

881
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:16,332
Now.

882
01:22:26,802 --> 01:22:28,052
Fire at will.

883
01:22:40,065 --> 01:22:42,984
Prepare a boarding party.
Bring me Picard.

884
01:22:45,404 --> 01:22:46,487
You.

885
01:22:48,907 --> 01:22:50,867
Get the cloak back!

886
01:22:50,951 --> 01:22:55,079
Target all shield coordinates, Beta-3.
All disruptors fire!

887
01:23:04,006 --> 01:23:07,425
Captain,
we've lost ventral shielding on Deck 29!

888
01:23:07,509 --> 01:23:09,927
Divert all power and compensate.

889
01:23:13,932 --> 01:23:17,268
- Intruder alert.
- Number One.

890
01:23:17,352 --> 01:23:20,813
- Let's go.
- Security detail to Deck 29.

891
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:42,710
The Romulans fought with honor.

892
01:23:43,712 --> 01:23:45,379
Yes, they did, Mr. Worf.

893
01:24:27,005 --> 01:24:28,297
Worf, cover me.

894
01:26:00,015 --> 01:26:02,183
Medical teams to the Bridge.

895
01:26:18,033 --> 01:26:19,158
Report.

896
01:26:19,242 --> 01:26:21,869
We have exhausted
our complement of photon torpedoes.

897
01:26:21,954 --> 01:26:23,788
Phaser banks are down to 4%, sir.

898
01:26:23,872 --> 01:26:27,291
What if we targeted all our phasers
in a concentrated pattern?

899
01:26:27,376 --> 01:26:31,963
The Scimitar shields are still at 70%.
It would make no difference, Captain.

900
01:26:41,473 --> 01:26:43,099
What's he doing?

901
01:26:54,903 --> 01:26:57,196
He wants to look me in the eye.

902
01:27:01,868 --> 01:27:03,244
We've got him.

903
01:27:06,748 --> 01:27:10,292
He thinks he knows exactly
what I'm going to do.

904
01:27:10,377 --> 01:27:14,005
Geordi, divert all power to the engines.
Take it from life support, if you have to.

905
01:27:14,089 --> 01:27:16,257
Give me everything you've got.

906
01:27:19,886 --> 01:27:21,429
Ready, Captain.

907
01:27:22,305 --> 01:27:24,348
We are being hailed, sir.

908
01:27:24,433 --> 01:27:27,643
Deanna, stand by. Open a channel.

909
01:27:29,938 --> 01:27:34,483
- I hope you're still alive, Jean-Luc.
- Yes, I am.

910
01:27:34,568 --> 01:27:37,278
Don't you think it's time to surrender?

911
01:27:37,446 --> 01:27:39,780
Why should the rest of your crew
have to die?

912
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:43,075
Shinzon, I don't think I ever told you

913
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,286
about my first Academy evaluation.

914
01:27:46,496 --> 01:27:49,290
In particular,
I was thought to be extremely

915
01:27:50,292 --> 01:27:51,834
overconfident.

916
01:27:52,586 --> 01:27:56,130
Captain, as much as I enjoy
listening to you talk, I really think...

917
01:27:58,050 --> 01:28:02,636
On my mark, Deanna.
All hands, brace for impact.

918
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,307
Engage.

919
01:28:25,577 --> 01:28:27,119
Hard to port!

920
01:29:58,962 --> 01:30:01,005
Divert all power to the engines.

921
01:30:02,716 --> 01:30:04,341
Full reverse.

922
01:31:39,187 --> 01:31:40,854
Reconfiguring now.

923
01:31:44,109 --> 01:31:47,236
Computer, stand by
auto-destruct sequence Omega.

924
01:31:47,862 --> 01:31:50,114
Recognize voice pattern
Jean-Luc Picard.

925
01:31:50,198 --> 01:31:53,284
Authorization Alpha-Alpha-3-0-5.

926
01:31:55,829 --> 01:31:57,871
Auto-destruct is offline.

927
01:32:19,144 --> 01:32:21,729
Disruptors are not functional, sir.

928
01:32:25,233 --> 01:32:26,942
Deploy the weapon.

929
01:32:29,571 --> 01:32:31,905
Kill everything on that ship,

930
01:32:32,907 --> 01:32:35,075
then set a course for Earth.

931
01:32:35,618 --> 01:32:37,953
We must complete our mission.

932
01:32:54,804 --> 01:32:56,347
Matrix initiated.

933
01:32:57,891 --> 01:33:01,810
Sequencing procedure
for thalaron radiation transfer

934
01:33:01,895 --> 01:33:03,228
activated.

935
01:33:10,362 --> 01:33:14,031
Some ideals are worth dying for,
aren't they, Jean-Luc?

936
01:33:27,128 --> 01:33:30,214
Thalaron intermix procedure initiated.

937
01:33:31,383 --> 01:33:34,968
Deployment of targeting arms
commencing.

938
01:33:58,034 --> 01:34:00,160
How long until he can fire?

939
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:07,751
The targeting sequence should
take about seven minutes, Captain.

940
01:34:07,836 --> 01:34:10,212
When the targeting arms
are fully deployed,

941
01:34:10,296 --> 01:34:13,298
the matrix on the Bridge
will relay the thalaron radiation

942
01:34:13,383 --> 01:34:15,843
to the firing points at their tips.

943
01:34:15,927 --> 01:34:18,595
No one on the Enterprise will survive.

944
01:34:23,184 --> 01:34:27,855
- How can he? He'll kill you.
- It's not about me anymore.

945
01:34:31,192 --> 01:34:34,653
- Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
- I don't think that the transport...

946
01:34:34,737 --> 01:34:37,072
- That's an order, Commander.
- Sir, allow me to go.

947
01:34:37,157 --> 01:34:39,450
- Data, this is something I have to do.
- Sir.

948
01:34:39,534 --> 01:34:41,785
- Data.
- You have the Bridge, Commander.

949
01:34:42,036 --> 01:34:45,038
Try and put some distance
between you and the Scimitar.

950
01:34:45,874 --> 01:34:48,375
- Now, Mr. La Forge.
- Aye, sir.

951
01:34:57,635 --> 01:35:01,180
That's it. Transporters are down.

952
01:35:06,853 --> 01:35:08,854
System is fused.

953
01:35:08,938 --> 01:35:12,483
Counselor Troi, please assume
command. Geordi, come with me.

954
01:36:08,498 --> 01:36:12,167
Thalaron intermix level: 30%.

955
01:36:38,736 --> 01:36:41,113
Four minutes to firing sequence.

956
01:37:21,029 --> 01:37:25,198
Thalaron intermix level: 50%.

957
01:37:37,503 --> 01:37:40,464
Three minutes to firing sequence.

958
01:38:00,735 --> 01:38:04,863
Thalaron intermix level: 60%.

959
01:39:02,547 --> 01:39:05,465
Two minutes to firing sequence.

960
01:39:28,156 --> 01:39:32,492
Thalaron intermix level: 80%.

961
01:39:58,436 --> 01:40:00,562
I'm glad we're together now.

962
01:40:02,899 --> 01:40:04,858
Our destiny is complete.

963
01:40:16,078 --> 01:40:18,371
One minute to firing sequence.

964
01:40:21,417 --> 01:40:24,628
Thalaron intermix level completed.

965
01:40:40,937 --> 01:40:43,688
30 seconds to firing sequence.

966
01:40:56,828 --> 01:40:58,411
Goodbye.

967
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:01,915
Ten, nine, eight,

968
01:41:02,416 --> 01:41:05,710
seven, six, five,

969
01:41:06,087 --> 01:41:09,548
four, three, two...

970
01:41:35,533 --> 01:41:36,616
Data?

971
01:42:07,648 --> 01:42:08,940
Captain.

972
01:42:15,323 --> 01:42:16,740
It's Data.

973
01:42:36,761 --> 01:42:39,262
Captain, we're being hailed.

974
01:42:40,348 --> 01:42:41,723
On-screen.

975
01:42:44,602 --> 01:42:46,186
Open a channel.

976
01:42:47,772 --> 01:42:50,273
This is Commander Donatra
of the Valdore.

977
01:42:50,358 --> 01:42:54,277
We're dispatching shuttles
with medical personnel and supplies.

978
01:42:57,031 --> 01:42:58,657
Thank you, Commander.

979
01:42:58,991 --> 01:43:02,786
You've earned a friend
in the Romulan Empire today, Captain.

980
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:05,246
I hope, the first of many.

981
01:43:06,666 --> 01:43:08,166
Valdore out.

982
01:43:13,172 --> 01:43:17,592
Geordi,
prepare the shuttlebay for arrivals.

983
01:43:19,804 --> 01:43:23,264
They don't know our procedures.

984
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:28,812
- Just open the doors.
- I'll take care of it, Captain.

985
01:43:29,105 --> 01:43:31,523
You have the Bridge, Number One.

986
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:50,417
Thank you.

987
01:44:02,847 --> 01:44:04,556
To absent friends.

988
01:44:09,478 --> 01:44:10,854
To family.

989
01:44:30,791 --> 01:44:32,876
First time I saw Data,

990
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,962
he was leaning against a tree
in the holodeck,

991
01:44:36,047 --> 01:44:40,091
trying to whistle.
Funniest thing I ever saw.

992
01:44:41,093 --> 01:44:44,554
No matter what he did,
he couldn't get the tune right.

993
01:44:46,474 --> 01:44:48,224
What was that song?

994
01:44:51,687 --> 01:44:53,646
Can't remember the song.

995
01:45:23,969 --> 01:45:25,053
Come.

996
01:45:27,473 --> 01:45:30,016
- Will.
- Permission to disembark, sir.

997
01:45:30,893 --> 01:45:32,185
Granted.

998
01:45:33,687 --> 01:45:36,689
So, where's the Titan off to?

999
01:45:36,857 --> 01:45:38,525
The Neutral Zone.

1000
01:45:38,901 --> 01:45:40,693
We're heading up the new task force.

1001
01:45:40,778 --> 01:45:43,655
Apparently,
the Romulans are interested in talking.

1002
01:45:44,031 --> 01:45:46,908
I can't think of a better man for the job.

1003
01:45:47,701 --> 01:45:51,621
If I may, just a word of advice
about your first command?

1004
01:45:51,705 --> 01:45:53,206
Anything.

1005
01:45:53,290 --> 01:45:58,169
When your First Officer insists
that you can't go on away missions...

1006
01:45:58,254 --> 01:46:01,673
Ignore him. I intend to.

1007
01:46:07,096 --> 01:46:10,723
Serving with you has been an honor.

1008
01:46:13,477 --> 01:46:16,396
The honor was mine, Captain.

1009
01:46:32,329 --> 01:46:35,165
I don't know
if all this has made any sense.

1010
01:46:35,249 --> 01:46:38,251
But I wanted you to know
what kind of man he was.

1011
01:46:38,669 --> 01:46:41,921
In his quest to be more like us,

1012
01:46:42,464 --> 01:46:45,592
he helped us to see
what it means to be human.

1013
01:46:48,262 --> 01:46:49,429
My...

1014
01:46:50,514 --> 01:46:52,765
My brother was not human.

1015
01:46:55,269 --> 01:46:57,020
No, he wasn't.

1016
01:46:58,355 --> 01:46:59,772
But his wonder,

1017
01:46:59,857 --> 01:47:03,818
his curiosity about
every facet of human nature

1018
01:47:03,903 --> 01:47:07,488
allowed all of us to see
the best parts of ourselves.

1019
01:47:07,573 --> 01:47:08,948
He evolved.

1020
01:47:10,409 --> 01:47:12,577
He embraced change

1021
01:47:12,661 --> 01:47:15,914
because he always wanted
to be better than he was.

1022
01:47:19,293 --> 01:47:20,376
I...

1023
01:47:22,755 --> 01:47:24,464
I do not understand.

1024
01:47:29,637 --> 01:47:31,846
Well, I hope someday you will.

1025
01:47:34,433 --> 01:47:37,644
Captain, the warp engines
are ready to go online.

1026
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:42,148
I'm on my way.
Please inform Commander La Forge.

1027
01:47:46,487 --> 01:47:48,154
We'll talk later.

1028
01:47:50,074 --> 01:47:52,325
Never saw the sun

1029
01:47:54,995 --> 01:47:57,830
Never saw the sun

1030
01:48:00,876 --> 01:48:03,503
Never saw the sun

1031
01:48:05,965 --> 01:48:07,840
Shining so bright

1032
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:10,510
Shining so bright

1033
01:48:12,388 --> 01:48:14,847
Never saw things

1034
01:48:19,603 --> 01:48:21,187
"Going so right."

1035
01:48:21,855 --> 01:48:23,898
Going so right
