-Permission to come aboard, sir.
-Granted, sir.

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,054
Welcome aboard, Admiral.

4
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:14,347
Commander Scott, you're needed
in engineering immediately.

5
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:15,891
Sir, you'll excuse me.

6
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,809
<i>Attention, launch crew.</i>

7

-Sir, if you'll follow me, l'll show you...
-l think l can find my way, Ensign.

10
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,322
Aye, sir.

11
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:35,660
Bridge.

12
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,125
What's the problem?

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,669
l thought you people had that circuit
patched in an hour ago!

14
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:47,172
We did. We had to disconnect it again
so we could tie in radio messaging.

15
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,673
All right. Take out...

16
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:56,973
All right, as soon as
somebody can get to it.

17
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,769
-What's the next programme?
-Go ahead.

18
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,687
l'll get somebody down there
as soon as l can.

19
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:04,856
Cleary, my people are all tied up now.

20
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:13,115
Captain, Starfleet just signalled your
transfer-of-command order, sir.

21
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:17,536
-Captain.
-l appreciate the welcome.

22
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,497
l wish the circumstances
were less critical.

23
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,375
Epsilon lX is monitoring the intruder.
Keep a channel open to them.

24
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,709
Aye, sir.

25
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,546
Where's Captain Decker?

26
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,798
He's in engineering, sir.

27
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,633
He...

28
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:32,717
He doesn't know.

29
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,139
-Mr Chekov.
-Aye, sir.

30
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:40,809
Assemble the crew on the recreation
deck at 0400 hours.

31
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,936
l want to show them what we're facing.

32
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:50,152
<i>Engineering to all decks,</i>

was not activated.

41

Faulty modules.

42
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,693
Cleary! Put a new backup sensor
into the unit.

43
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,028
Aye, sir.

44
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,280
<i>-Ready.
-Emergency shut-down trip.</i>

45
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:39,159
Admiral Kirk!
Well, we're getting a top-brass sendoff.

46
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,328
Don't worry. She'll launch on schedule,

47
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,996
if we have to tow her out
with our bare hands.

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,791
-Right, Scotty?
-Aye, that we will, sir.

49
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,295
-Let's talk.
-Sure.

50
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,588
Let me know when that backup's ready.

51
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,756
Aye, sir.

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,926
All due respect, sir, l hope this isn't
some kind of Starfleet pep talk.

53
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,177
l'm really too busy.

54
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,346
l'm taking over the centre seat, Will.

55
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:01,139
You're what?

56
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,558
l'm replacing you as
captain of the Enterprise.

57
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:06,311
You'll stay on as executive officer,

58
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,522
temporary grade reduction
to commander.

59
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:14,236
You, personally,
are assuming command?

60
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,362
Yeah.

61
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:19,199
-May l ask why?
-My experience.

62
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:23,203
Five years out there
dealing with unknowns like this.

63
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,581
My familiarity with the Enterprise,
its crew.

64
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,168
Admiral, this is
an almost totally new Enterprise.

65
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:31,962
You don't know her
a tenth as well as l do!

66
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,005
That's why you're staying aboard.

67
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,930
l'm sorry, Will.

68
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,724
No, Admiral. l don't think you're sorry.

69
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:47,185
Not one damn bit.

70
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,439
l remember when you recommended
me for this command.

71
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,857
You told me how envious you were

72
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:56,736
and how much you hoped you'd find
a way to get a starship command again.

73
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,906
Well, sir,

74
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,993
it looks like you found a way.

75
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:09,874
Report to the bridge, Commander,
immediately.

76
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,212
Aye, sir.

77
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:28,393
Transporter room, come in! Urgent!

78
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,312
Red line on the transporter, Mr Scott.

79
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,647
Transporter! Do not engage.

80
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,734
-lt's too late. They're beaming now.
-Do not...

81
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:40,697
<i>Do you read me, Starfleet?
Override it. Pull them back.</i>

82

<i>Unable to retrieve their pattern,
Enterprise.</i>

83

<i>Malfunction! Malfunction! Malfunction!</i>

84
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,043
<i>-Malfunction! Malfunction!

85
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,337
<i>Malfunction!</i>

86
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,467
Starfleet, boost your matter gain.
We need more signal.

87
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,183
-More signal!
-We're losing their pattern.

88
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,518
Oh, no. They're forming.

89
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,329
Oh, my God.

90
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,546
Starfleet, do you have them?

91
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:44,052
<i>Enterprise, what we got back
didn't live long.</i>

92
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,303
<i>Fortunately.</i>

93
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,143
Starfleet, Kirk.

94
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,148
Please express my condolences
to their families.

95
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,737
Commander Sonak's can be reached
through the Vulcan Embassy.

96
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:11,204
There was nothing you
could have done, Rand.

97
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,164
lt wasn't your fault.

98
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:41,276
-Yeoman, turboshaft eight?
-Back that way, sir.

99
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,869
We have to replace Commander Sonak.

100
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,206
l'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible.

101
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,125
None available, Captain.

102
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:00,295
ln fact, there's no one
who's fully rated on this design.

103
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,547
You are, Mr Decker.

104
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,884
l'm afraid you're gonna have
to double as science officer.

105
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,001
That's all we know about it.

106
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:45,590
Except that it is now 53.4 hours
away from Earth.

107
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:53,556
Enterprise is the only Federation
starship that stands in its way.

108
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:58,186
We assume that there is a vessel of
some type at the heart of the cloud.

109
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,689
Our orders are to intercept,

110
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,610
investigate and take whatever action
is necessary

111
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,238
and possible.

112
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:16,037
We can only hope that there is
a life form aboard that vessel

113
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,748
that reasons the way we do.

114
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:26,839
<i>Bridge to Captain.

-Decker.

142
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,273
l was stationed on the lieutenant's

Commander Decker?

144
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,153
Yes, our exec and science officer.

145
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,530
Captain Kirk has
the utmost confidence in me.

146
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,909
And, in you, too, Lieutenant.

147

00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,385
ln simpler language, Captain,
they drafted me.

160
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:42,929
They didn't.

161
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,267
This was your idea.
This was your idea, wasn't it?

162

Bones, there's a thing out there.

163
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:53,064
Why is any object we don't understand
always called a "thing"?

164
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,732
Headed this way.

165
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,901

166
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,031
Damn it, Bones. l need you.

167
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,116
Badly!

Well, l'm going to need a top nurse.

172
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,732
Not a doctor who'll argue
every little diagnosis with me.

173
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:41,028
And they probably redesigned
the whole sickbay, too.

174
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,781

They love to change things.

Well, Bones, do the new medical
facilities meet with your approval?

197
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:59,245
They do not. lt's like working
in a damned computer centre.

further simulation study.

201
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:10,589
Mr Decker, every minute brings
that object closer to Earth.

Aye, lad.

We're at warp 0.8.

257
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,508
Engineer, report your status there.

ln just a second, Exec.
We're picking up the pieces down here!

259
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,434
Mr Scott, we need warp drive
as soon as possible.

260
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,769
Captain, it was the engine imbalance

261
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,397
that created the wormhole
in the first place.

262
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,566
<i>lt will happen again
if we don't correct it.</i>

263
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,609
That object is less than two days
away from Earth.

264
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:26,029
We need to intercept
while it still is out there.

265
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,614
Navigator, lay in a new heading

266
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:30,868
to conform with our initial lP
with the intruder.

267
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,786
Mr Sulu, you have the conn.

268
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:36,373
Mr Decker, l'd like to
see you in my quarters.

269
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,709
Mind if l tag along, Captain?

270
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:43,839
Level five.

271
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,725
All right, explanation. Why was
my phaser order countermanded?

272
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,769
Sir, the Enterprise redesign
increases phaser power

273
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,147
by channelling it through
the main engines.

274
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,691
When they went
into anti-matter imbalance,

275
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,194
the phasers were automatically cut off.

276
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,908
Then you acted properly, of course.

277
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,952
Thank you, sir.

278
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,122
l'm sorry if l embarrassed you.

279
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,585
-You saved the ship.
-l'm aware of that, sir.

280
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:25,589
Stop competing with me, Decker!

281
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,760
-Permission to speak freely, sir?
-Granted!

282
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:34,056
Sir, you haven't logged a single
star hour in two and a half years.

283
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,268
That, plus your unfamiliarity with
the ship's redesign, in my opinion, sir,

284
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,854
seriously jeopardises this mission.

285
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:49,112
l trust you will

286
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:53,075
nursemaid me through
these difficulties, mister?

287
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,535
Yes, sir, l'll do that.

288
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:57,246
Then l won't keep you from
your duties any longer, Commander.

289
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:59,540
-Yes, Doctor?
-Aye, sir.

290
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,590
He may be right, Jim.

291
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,977
Was it difficult?

292
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,687
No more than l expected.

293
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,981
About as difficult as seeing you again.

294
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,651
l'm sorry.

295
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:31,655
That you left Delta lV?
Or that you didn't even say goodbye?

296
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:38,036
lf l had seen you again,

297
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,247
would you have been able to say it?

298
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,084
No.

299
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,724
Make your point, Doctor.

300
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:02,185
The point, Captain, is that
it's you who's competing.

301
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,938
You rammed getting this command
down Starfleet's throat.

302
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:07,691
You've used this emergency
to get the Enterprise back.

303
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,363
And l intend to keep her,
is that what you're saying?

304
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:16,825
Yes. lt's an obsession.

305
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,036
An obsession that can blind you

306
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,414
to far more immediate
and critical responsibilities.

307
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:26,960
Your reaction to Decker
is an example, Jim.

308

<i>-Bridge to Captain.

Spock.

Commander, if l may?

l've been monitoring

with Starfleet Command, Captain.

327
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:21,301
l'm aware of your

l offer my services as science officer.

329

With all due respect, Commander.

lf our exec has no objections?

331
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:32,771
Of course not. l'm well aware
of Mr Spock's qualifications.

Please, sit down.

356
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,344
Spock, you haven't changed a bit.

357
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,180
You're just as warm and
sociable as ever.

358
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,474
Nor have you, Doctor,

359
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,269
as your continued predilection
for irrelevancy demonstrates.

360
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:19,938
Gentlemen.

361
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:26,820
At last report, you were on Vulcan,
apparently to stay.

362
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:30,573
Yes, you were undergoing
the Kolinahr discipline.

363
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:32,826
Sit down.

364
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:37,664
lf you are referring to the Kolinahr,
Doctor, you are correct.

365
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,625
Well, however it's pronounced,
Mr Spock,

366
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,505
it's the Vulcan ritual that's supposed
to purge all remaining emotions.

367
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,842
The Kolinahr is also
a discipline you broke

368
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,677
to join us.

369
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:56,099
Will you please sit down?

370
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,238
On Vulcan l began
sensing a consciousness

371
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,908
from a source more powerful
than l have ever encountered.

372
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:17,162
Thought patterns
of exactingly, perfect order.

373
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:20,165
l believe they emanate
from the intruder.

374
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,584
l believe it may hold my answers.

375
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,546
Well, isn't it lucky for you that we just
happened to be heading your way?

376
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,674
Bones!

377
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,469
We need him.

378
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:35,930
l need him.

379
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:40,226
Then my presence is to
our mutual advantage?

380
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,319
Any thought patterns you might sense,

381
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,448
whether they appear to
affect you personally or not,

382
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,742
l expect immediately reported.

383
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,327
Of course, Captain.

384
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,538

No.

lf this super-intelligence is as important
to him as he says it is,

00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:24,687
how do we know...

389
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:27,690
That he wouldn't put his own
interests ahead of the ship's?

390
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:31,402
l could never believe that.

Negative. We'll take

Captain. Screens and shields.

No, Mr Decker. That could
also be misinterpreted as hostile.

-Twelfth power?

Captain, we've seen what
their weapons can do.

411
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,370
Shouldn't we take
every possible precaution?

-Mr Decker...
-Captain.

at the heart of that cloud.

414

Mr Decker, l will not provoke an attack.

416
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:22,847
Captain, as your exec,
it's my duty to point out alternatives.

417
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,227
Yes, it is.

and understood, Mr Spock.

467
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:19,750
l would say that was
a logical assumption, Captain.

468

That thing is 20 hours away from Earth.

00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,997
-We know nothing about it as yet.
-Precisely the point, Captain.

476
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,792
We don't know what it'll do.
Moving into that cloud at this time

477
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,879
is an unwarranted gamble.

00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,257
How do you define "unwarranted"?

479
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:13,763
You asked my opinion, sir.

480
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,439
Viewer, standard ahead.

481
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:37,828
Navigator, maintain course.
Helmsman, steady as she goes.

482
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:54,882
No vessel could generate
a power field of this magnitude.

483
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:59,220
Spock?

484
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:03,516
lnstruments fluctuating, Captain.

485
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,396
Patterns unrecognisable.

486
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,126
Transmit image of alien to Starfleet.

487
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:55,795
Advise we are
attempting further communication.

488
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:58,839
Unable to make contact
with Starfleet, Captain.

489
00:45:58,924 --> 00:46:02,885
Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud
is being reflected back!

490
00:46:12,062 --> 00:46:14,230
We are closing on it rapidly, Captain.

491
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:26,033
Reduce magnification,
factor four, Mr Sulu.

492
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,160
We're already two settings
below that, sir.

493
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:34,708
Mr Sulu,

494
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:40,756
bring us into a parallel course
over the alien at 500 metres.

495
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,217
500 metres?

496
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:48,681
Then take us out to 1 00 kilometres
distance, adjusting parallel course.

497
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,684
Aye, sir.

498
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:55,265
-Viewer astern.
-Reverse angle on the viewer, Captain.

499
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:19,623
Five hundred metres.
Viewer ahead, sir.

500
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:51,483
Hold relative position here.

501
00:51:52,193 --> 00:52:01,577
<i>lntruder Alert! lntruder Alert!</i>

502
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:35,611
Mr Spock, can that
be one of their crew?

503
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:41,241
A probe from their vessel, Captain.
Plasma, energy combination.

504
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:45,746
Don't interfere with it!

505
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,040
Absolutely, l will not interfere.

506
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,960
No one interfere!

507
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:55,005
lt doesn't seem interested in us!

508
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,341
Only the ship.

509
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:14,942
Computer off!

510
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:24,159
lt's taken control of the computer.

511
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:33,835
lt's running our records!
Earth defences! Starfleet strength!

512
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:16,211
llia!

513
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:41,695
This is how l define unwarranted.

514
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:54,624
Activate auxiliary computer circuits
through manual shutoff.

515
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:09,681
<i>Emergency Alert!
Negative control at helm!</i>

516
00:55:09,766 --> 00:55:11,767
Force fields! Full remaining strength!
Total reserve!

517
00:55:11,893 --> 00:55:14,561
This ship is under attack.
Man all defensive stations.

518
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:23,487
Captain, we've been
seized by a tractor beam.

519
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:25,947
Get someone up here to take
the navigator's station.

520
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:27,741
-Engineering!
-Chief DiFalco, to the bridge!

521
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:28,909
Emergency power!

522
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:32,245
Going to full emergency!

523
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:36,750
But, Captain, if we don't break
free in 1 5 seconds, she'll burn up!

524
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,502
We cannot break free, Captain.

525
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:40,879
We have only a fraction
of the power necessary.

526
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:45,467
Engineering, belay that order.
Disengage all main drive systems.

527
00:56:03,528 --> 00:56:06,655
Chief DiFalco,
take over Lieutenant llia's station.

528
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:15,664
DiFalco, disengage engine
navigation relays now!

529
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:16,790
Aye, sir.

530
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:20,460
Force field circuits E 1 0 through 14
show ready for reactivation.

531
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:21,837
Confirm, please.

532
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,465
Scotty, drive systems
should be free now.

533
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,716
Commander?

534
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:28,802
Ready to launch remote
communications drone

535
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:32,389
with complete ships records,
including our present situation, sir.

536
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:34,015
Delay launching as long as possible.

537
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,601
Our drone can't escape as long
as we're held in that tractor.

538
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:37,769
<i>Aye.</i>

539
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:06,965
Captain, a maximum phaser strike
directly at the beam

540
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,092
might weaken it just enough
for us to break free.

541
00:57:09,177 --> 00:57:11,761
Break free to where, Commander?

542
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:14,764
Any show of resistance
would be futile, Captain.

543
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,766
We don't know that, Mr Spock.

544
00:57:17,894 --> 00:57:19,728
Why are you opposed to trying?

545
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:16,701
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us.
They could have done that outside.

546
00:58:16,786 --> 00:58:18,662
They still can.

547
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:20,455
Curiosity, Mr Decker.

548
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:25,126
lnsatiable curiosity.

549
00:58:33,052 --> 00:58:38,014
Captain, photic sonar readings
indicate the aperture is closing.

550
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:39,808
We're trapped, sir.

551
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:43,270
Reverse angle on the viewer, Captain.

552
00:59:08,004 --> 00:59:10,880
Tractor beam has released us, Captain.

553
00:59:11,007 --> 00:59:15,552
Confirmed. Vessel is floating free.
No forward momentum.

554
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,307
-Viewer ahead.
-Viewer ahead, sir.

555
00:59:25,938 --> 00:59:29,024
Manoeuvring thrusters, Mr Sulu.
Ahead one third.

556
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:31,359
Thrusters ahead, one third.

557
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:40,785
Let's take a look.
Full sensor scan, Mr Spock.

558
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:43,121
They can't expect us
not to look them over now.

559
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:44,623
Now that we're
looking down their throat.

560
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:47,083
Right. Now that we've got them
just where they want us.

561
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:06,311
lt's closing up.

562
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,232
Hold position.

563
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:13,109
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.

564
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:18,073
Captain?

565
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:25,664
All our scans are being reflected back.
Sensors are useless.

566
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,415
Damn!

567
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:37,008
What do you make of all this?

568
01:00:37,093 --> 01:00:40,720
l believe the closed orifice
leads to another chamber.

569
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:43,556
Undoubtedly, part of
the vessel's inner mechanism.

570
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:47,644
l suspect it may be necessary...

571
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:54,818
<i>-lntruder Alert! lntruder Alert!

573
01:00:57,113 --> 01:00:59,531

<i>-Hold position.

<i>60 degrees.</i>

<i>Temperature levelling, 39 degrees.</i>

580
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:26,516
You are the Kirk-unit.
You will assist me.

581
01:01:26,851 --> 01:01:29,102
<i>Holding at 37.65 degrees.</i>

582
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:34,232
l've been programmed by V'Ger
to observe and record

583
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:39,821
normal functions of the carbon-based
units infesting U.S.S. Enterprise.

584
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:43,283
<i>Holding at 37.65 degrees.</i>

585
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:54,419
-Jim, what's going on?
-Tricorder.

586
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:01,801
Who is V'Ger?

587
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:05,680
V'Ger is that which programmed me.

588
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:10,685
ls V'Ger the name of
the captain of the alien vessel?

589
01:02:11,187 --> 01:02:16,149
-Jim, this is a mechanism.
-A probe, Captain.

590
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:20,528
No doubt a sensor-transceiver
combination

591
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:23,156
recording everything we say and do.

592
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:28,328
-Where is Lieutenant llia?
-That unit no longer functions.

593
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:31,372
l've been given its form
to more readily communicate

594
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:35,418
with the carbon-based units
infesting Enterprise.

595
01:02:35,503 --> 01:02:40,340
-Carbon-based units?
-Humans, Ensign Perez. Us.

596
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:44,969
Why does V'Ger travel
to the third planet

597
01:02:45,054 --> 01:02:47,514
of the solar system directly ahead?

598
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,516
To find the Creator.

599
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:54,604
Find the Creator? Whose...

600
01:02:58,526 --> 01:03:00,819
What does V'Ger want
with the Creator?

601
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:02,487
To join with him.

602
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:05,365
To join with the Creator? How?

603
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,576
V'Ger and the Creator will become one.

604
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:10,370
And who is the Creator?

605
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:13,248
The Creator is that
which created V'Ger.

606
01:03:13,332 --> 01:03:17,293
-Who is V'Ger?
-V'Ger is that which seeks the Creator.

607
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:24,050
l'm ready to commence
my observations.

608
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:28,388
Doctor, a thorough examination of
this probe might provide some insight

609
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:32,183
into those who manufactured it
and how to deal with them.

610
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:35,436
Fine. Let's get her to sickbay.

611
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,776
l am programmed to observe and record

612
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:44,445
only the normal functioning
of the carbon-based units.

613
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:48,575
The examination is a normal function.

614
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:53,454
You may proceed.

615
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:01,629
Micro-miniature hydraulics,

616
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:06,426
sensors

617
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:13,808
and molecule-sized
multi-processor chips.

618
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:20,857
And take a look at this.

619
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:23,735
An osmotic micro-pump right here.

620
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:27,113
And even the smallest body functions
are exactly duplicated.

621
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:32,744
Every exocrine system is the same, too.

622
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:36,122
Even eye moisture.

623
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:38,333
Decker.

624
01:04:39,877 --> 01:04:42,837
Fascinating. Not "Decker-unit"?

625
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:48,885
Gentlemen.

626
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,262
Will.

627
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,358
What happened to her?

628
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:06,945
Captain, this probe may be
our key to the aliens.

629
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:08,863
Probe? "llia"?

630
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:12,325
Exactly. lt is a programmed
mechanism, Commander.

631
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:16,120
lts body duplicates our
navigator in precise detail.

632
01:05:16,205 --> 01:05:18,331
Suppose that beneath its programming,

633
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:22,460
the real llia's memory patterns are
duplicated with equal precision.

634
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:25,088
-They had a pattern to follow.
-lndeed.

635
01:05:25,214 --> 01:05:27,382
They may have followed it
too precisely.

636
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:30,802
llia's memory, her feelings of loyalty,

637
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:35,264
obedience, friendship
might all be there!

638
01:05:35,391 --> 01:05:39,352
You did have a relationship
with Lieutenant llia, Commander.

639
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:42,021
That probe, in another form,
is what killed llia!

640
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:43,731
Commander!

641
01:05:43,816 --> 01:05:45,274
Will,

642
01:05:45,401 --> 01:05:48,069
we're locked in an alien vessel,
six hours from Earth orbit.

643
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:50,571
Our only contact with
our captor is that probe.

644
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:53,825
lf we could control it,
persuade it, use it...

645
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:00,748
l have recorded enough here.
You will now assist me further.

646
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:08,131
The Decker-unit can assist you
with much greater efficiency.

647
01:06:13,846 --> 01:06:15,972
Carry on with your assignment,
Mr Decker.

648
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,142
Aye, sir.

649
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:27,275
l am concerned with that being
our only source of information, Captain.

650
01:06:31,864 --> 01:06:34,782
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 7414.1 .</i>

651
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:39,287
<i>Our best estimates place
us some four hours from Earth.</i>

652
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:41,581
<i>No significant progress thus far,</i>

653
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:45,460
<i>reviving llia memory patterns
within the alien probe.</i>

654
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:49,130
<i>This remains our only
means of contact with our captor.</i>

655
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:51,799
<i>All those vessels
were called Enterprise.</i>

656
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,981
The carbon units use this area
for recreation.

657
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,650
This is one of the games.

658
01:07:14,323 --> 01:07:19,118
What types of recreation does
the crew aboard your vessel enjoy?

659
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:23,581
The words "recreation" and "enjoy"

660
01:07:24,917 --> 01:07:27,293
have no meaning to my programming.

661
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:37,929
llia enjoyed this game.

662
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,557
She nearly always won.

663
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:50,525
Good. He's using
audio-visual association.

664
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:28,729
This device serves no purpose.

665
01:08:40,576 --> 01:08:43,828
Why does Enterprise require
the presence of carbon units?

666
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:48,082
Enterprise would be unable to
function without carbon units.

667
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:52,336
More data concerning this
functioning is necessary,

668
01:08:52,421 --> 01:08:57,133
before carbon units can be
patterned for data storage.

669
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:02,513
What does that mean?

670
01:09:02,598 --> 01:09:06,434
When my examination is
complete all carbon units

671
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:09,562
will be reduced to data patterns.

672
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:14,650
Within you are the memory
patterns of a certain carbon unit.

673
01:09:14,735 --> 01:09:17,361
lf l can help you
to revive those patterns,

674
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,198
you could understand
our functions better.

675
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:24,285
That is logical. You may proceed.

676
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:15,002
l remember Lieutenant llia
once mentioning she wore that.

677
01:10:19,675 --> 01:10:22,927
On Delta. Remember?

678
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,680
llia?

679
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,437
Doctor Chapel.

680
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:47,201
-Will?
-llia.

681
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:52,707
Commander. Commander.

682
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:58,045
This is a mechanism.

683
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:02,717
llia,

684
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:08,639
help us make direct contact with V'Ger.

685
01:11:08,724 --> 01:11:13,227
-l cannot.
-This Creator V'Ger is looking for,

686
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:18,858
-what is it?
-V'Ger does not know.

687
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:49,388
Computer, commence recording.

688
01:11:50,182 --> 01:11:55,936
Captain Kirk, these messages will detail
my attempt to contact the aliens.

689
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:08,866
<i>Warning! Your emergency evacuation
thruster pack has been armed.</i>

690
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:13,788
<i>Once ignited, the burn duration is
10 seconds and may not be aborted.</i>

691
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:18,709
<i>Push the igniter-enable release
to begin a 10-second countdown</i>

692
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:20,461
<i>to thruster ignition.</i>

693
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:25,132
<i>To abort countdown,
flip the control arm up.</i>

694
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:28,135
l intend to calculate thruster
ignition and acceleration rate

695
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:30,888
to coincide with the opening
of the V'Ger orifice.

696
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:34,934
This should facilitate a better view
of the interior of the alien spacecraft.

697
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:44,276
Captain? Starfleet signals are
growing in strength, sir.

698
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:48,114
They still have the intruder
on their monitors. lt's decelerating.

699
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:52,785
Confirmed, sir. Lunar beacons indicate
intruder on a course into Earth orbit.

700
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:58,666
Sir, airlock four has been opened.
A thruster suit is reported missing.

701
01:13:00,669 --> 01:13:04,130
A thruster suit?

702
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:07,299
That's Spock. Damn him.

703
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:10,761
Bring him back here. No, wait!

704
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:21,272
-Get a fix on his position.
-Aye, sir!

705
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:42,895
l have successfully penetrated
the next chamber of the alien's interior,

706
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,940
and l'm witnessing some sort of
dimensional image,

707
01:14:46,024 --> 01:14:49,527
which l believe to be a representation
of V'Ger's home planet.

708
01:14:58,286 --> 01:15:00,162
l'm passing through
a connecting tunnel.

709
01:15:00,247 --> 01:15:03,958
Apparently, a kind of
plasma energy conduit,

710
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:07,294
possibly a field coil
for a gigantic imaging system.

711
01:15:18,306 --> 01:15:23,227
Curious. l'm seeing images of planets,
moons, stars,

712
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:26,188
whole galaxies,
all stored here, recorded.

713
01:15:26,273 --> 01:15:29,066
lt could be a representation
of V'Ger's entire journey.

714
01:15:34,823 --> 01:15:38,909
But who or what are we dealing with?

715
01:15:38,994 --> 01:15:42,705
The Epsilon lX station,
stored here with every detail.

716
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:54,675
Captain, l am now quite convinced
that all of this is V'Ger.

717
01:15:55,135 --> 01:15:58,262
That we are inside a living machine.

718
01:16:03,852 --> 01:16:04,852
llia!

719
01:16:10,442 --> 01:16:15,237
The sensor must contain some
special meaning.

720
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:21,035
l must try to mind-meld with it.

721
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:19,718
Spock! Spock! Spock!

722
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:39,613
Now scanning pons area
at spinal nerve fibre connection.

723
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:46,704
lndications of some
neurological trauma.

724
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:50,999
The power pouring through that
mind-meld must have been staggering.

725
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,009
-Spock.
-Jim,

726
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:06,473
l should have known.

727
01:18:06,558 --> 01:18:09,476
Were you right? About V'Ger?

728
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:12,813
A life form of its own.

729
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:18,527
-A conscious, living entity.
-A living machine?

730
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,070
lt considers the Enterprise
a living machine.

731
01:18:20,155 --> 01:18:22,906
That's why the probe
refers to our ship as an entity.

732
01:18:22,991 --> 01:18:25,826
l saw V'Ger's planet,

733
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:29,580
a planet populated by living machines.

734
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:32,166
Unbelievable technology.

735
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,129
V'Ger has knowledge
that spans this universe.

736
01:18:39,174 --> 01:18:42,843
And yet, with all its pure logic,

737
01:18:44,429 --> 01:18:48,098
V'Ger is barren, cold.

738
01:18:48,183 --> 01:18:52,561
No mystery. No beauty.

739
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:58,859
l should've known.

740
01:19:00,612 --> 01:19:05,365
Known? Known what? Spock.

741
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:07,367
-Captain.
-Bones!

742
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:17,211
Spock! What should you have known?
What should you have known?

743
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,759
Jim,

744
01:19:27,889 --> 01:19:31,475
this simple feeling

745
01:19:33,228 --> 01:19:35,479
is beyond V'Ger's comprehension.

746
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,907
No meaning. No hope.

747
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:52,371
And Jim, no answers.

748
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:57,417
-lt's asking questions.
-What questions?

749
01:19:57,961 --> 01:20:01,588
"ls this all that l am?"

750
01:20:03,091 --> 01:20:05,008
"ls there nothing more?"

751
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:12,975
<i>Bridge to Captain.</i>

752
01:20:16,563 --> 01:20:17,688
Kirk here.

753
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:19,773
A faint signal from Starfleet, sir.

754
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:23,193
lntruder cloud has been
located on their outer monitors

755
01:20:23,278 --> 01:20:25,320
for the past 27 minutes.

756
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:28,365
Cloud dissipating rapidly
as it approaches.

757
01:20:29,117 --> 01:20:32,369
Starfleet reports forward velocity
has slowed to sub-warp speed.

758
01:20:32,871 --> 01:20:36,623
-We are three minutes from Earth orbit.
-l'll be right there.

759
01:20:40,962 --> 01:20:43,046
l need Spock on the bridge.

760
01:20:43,131 --> 01:20:45,257
Dalaphaline, five cc's.

761
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:51,638
A machine planet
sending a machine to Earth,

762
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:55,726
looking for its Creator.

763
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:00,814
lt's absolutely incredible.

764
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,071
Mr Chekov,
Commander Decker's present location?

765
01:21:08,156 --> 01:21:10,198
<i>He... They are in engineering, sir.</i>

766
01:21:20,335 --> 01:21:23,795
Captain, Starfleet is sending
this tactical on V'Ger's position.

767
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,800
V'Ger is transmitting a signal.

768
01:21:31,346 --> 01:21:34,431
-Jim.
-From V'Ger.

769
01:21:39,062 --> 01:21:41,688
V'Ger signals the Creator.

770
01:21:56,454 --> 01:21:57,454
Spock?

771
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:03,543
A simple binary code
transmitted by carrier wave signal.

772
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:06,380
Radio.

773
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:10,008
Radio?

774
01:22:15,306 --> 01:22:19,393
Jim, V'Ger expects an answer.

775
01:22:20,687 --> 01:22:23,438
An answer? l don't know the question.

776
01:22:25,066 --> 01:22:27,109
The Creator has not responded.

777
01:22:41,749 --> 01:22:45,252
All planetary defence systems
have just gone inoperative!

778
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:29,421
Sir, Starfleet computes the devices
are proceeding

779
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:32,591
toward equidistant positions,
orbiting the planet.

780
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:34,509
They're the same things that hit us.

781
01:23:34,594 --> 01:23:37,220
They are hundreds of times
more powerful, Captain.

782
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:38,555
From those positions,

783
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,308
they could devastate
the entire surface of the planet.

784
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:58,909
-Why?
-The Creator has not answered.

785
01:23:58,993 --> 01:24:02,871
The carbon-unit infestation is to be
removed from the Creator's planet.

786
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:06,583
-Why?
-You infest Enterprise.

787
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:09,419
You interfere with the Creator
in the same manner.

788
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:12,881
Machine.

789
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:19,387
V'Ger. V'Ger!

790
01:24:30,525 --> 01:24:31,942
Captain.

791
01:24:36,531 --> 01:24:38,907
V'Ger is a child.

792
01:24:40,118 --> 01:24:42,202
l suggest you treat her as such.

793
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:44,913
-A child?
-Yes, Captain. A child.

794
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:49,084
Evolving, learning, searching,

795
01:24:50,211 --> 01:24:51,711
instinctively needing.

796
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:53,755
Needing what?

797
01:24:54,132 --> 01:24:58,635
Spock, this child is about to
wipe out every living thing on Earth.

798
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:02,347
Now what do you suggest we do?
Spank it?

799
01:25:05,935 --> 01:25:09,271
lt knows only that it needs, Commander,

800
01:25:09,355 --> 01:25:14,067
but like so many of us,
it does not know what.

801
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:30,959
The carbon units know why
the Creator has not responded.

802
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:36,673
Disclose the information.

803
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:40,594
Not until V'Ger withdraws
the devices orbiting the third planet!

804
01:25:40,678 --> 01:25:41,720
Captain!

805
01:25:44,724 --> 01:25:47,809
l'm losing Starfleet!
lnterference from V'Ger!

806
01:25:49,103 --> 01:25:53,148
Kirk-unit, disclose the information.

807
01:25:53,232 --> 01:25:56,234
Why has the Creator not responded?

808
01:25:56,819 --> 01:25:57,819
No.

809
01:26:01,908 --> 01:26:04,701
Secure all stations. Clear the bridge.

810
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:09,789
Clear the bridge, Captain?

811
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:12,334
That was the order, Mr Sulu.
Clear the bridge!

812
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:13,460
Aye, sir.

813
01:26:20,635 --> 01:26:24,054
Your child is having a tantrum,
Mr Spock.

814
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:28,141
V'Ger requires the information.

815
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:34,397
Bridge! Secure all stations! Move out!

816
01:26:34,482 --> 01:26:36,691
Jim, what the hell kind of
strategy is this?

817
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:40,820
All ship's functions
going to automatic, Captain.

818
01:26:40,905 --> 01:26:42,239
lf V'Ger destroys the Enterprise,

819
01:26:42,323 --> 01:26:45,116
the information that V'Ger
requires will also be destroyed!

820
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:49,246
lt is illogical to withhold
required information.

821
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:52,374
Kirk-unit! Kirk-unit.

822
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:58,380
Why do you not disclose information?

823
01:27:02,176 --> 01:27:05,512
Because V'Ger's going to destroy
all the carbon units on the third planet.

824
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:09,557
-They have repressed the Creator.
-The information will not be disclosed!

825
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:13,478
V'Ger needs the information.

826
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:17,440
Then V'Ger must withdraw
all the orbiting devices.

827
01:27:19,026 --> 01:27:23,863
V'Ger will comply, if the carbon units
will disclose the information.

828
01:27:30,496 --> 01:27:32,497
lt learns fast, doesn't it?

829
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:35,959
Captain, the vessel, V'Ger,

830
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:39,129
obviously operates from
a central brain complex.

831
01:27:40,089 --> 01:27:42,757
The orbiting devices would be
controlled from that point then?

832
01:27:42,842 --> 01:27:44,384
Precisely.

833
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:57,856
The carbon unit's information
cannot be disclosed to V'Ger's probe,

834
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:00,900
but only to V'Ger directly.

835
01:28:24,592 --> 01:28:27,469
-Forward motion, Captain.
-Tractor beam.

836
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:47,989
Captain, what's the next move?

837
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:53,203
The question is, Mr Decker,
is there a next move?

838
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:58,416
Resume duty stations.

839
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,920
All personnel, resume stations!

840
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:11,054
Well, Mr Decker, it seems
my bluff has been called.

841
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:15,892
l'm afraid our hand
is pretty weak, Captain.

842
01:29:20,481 --> 01:29:23,650
Mr Chekov, when do those devices
reach final position?

843
01:29:24,527 --> 01:29:27,779
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark!

844
01:29:33,536 --> 01:29:36,162
Captain, l believe that is our destination.

845
01:29:43,337 --> 01:29:45,505
Forward motion, slowing, Captain.

846
01:29:48,843 --> 01:29:53,555
l read an oxygen-gravity envelope
forming outside the Enterprise.

847
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:03,314
Forward motion, stopped, Captain.

848
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:09,446
V'Ger.

849
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:13,491
Sir, l've located the source
of V'Ger's radio signal.

850
01:30:13,576 --> 01:30:15,285
lt's directly ahead.

851
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:19,038
That transmitter is a vital link
between V'Ger and its Creator.

852
01:30:22,835 --> 01:30:28,131
The carbon units will now provide V'Ger
with the required information.

853
01:30:34,847 --> 01:30:37,599
Mr Spock? Bones?

854
01:30:40,978 --> 01:30:44,898
Mr Decker, l will contact you
every five minutes.

855
01:30:48,569 --> 01:30:50,737
Captain, l'd like to go along.

856
01:30:54,033 --> 01:30:56,242
Mr Sulu, you have the conn.

857
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:51,941
V'Ger.

858
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:07,809
V-G-E-R.

859
01:34:10,813 --> 01:34:11,813
V'Ger.

860
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:29,205
V-O-Y-A-G-E-R.

861
01:34:29,289 --> 01:34:30,498
Voyager!

862
01:34:34,628 --> 01:34:36,546
<i>Voyager Vl!</i>

863
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:38,256
NASA.

864
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:41,134
National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

865
01:34:41,218 --> 01:34:45,471
Jim, this was launched
more than 300 years ago.

866
01:34:49,476 --> 01:34:50,810
Voyager series,

867
01:34:53,105 --> 01:34:54,731
designed to collect data

868
01:34:57,568 --> 01:34:59,318
and transmit it back to Earth.

869
01:35:41,612 --> 01:35:48,576
Captain, Voyager Vl disappeared into
what they used to call a black hole.

870
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:52,622
lt must have emerged on
the far side of the galaxy

871
01:35:52,706 --> 01:35:55,833
and fell into the machine planet's
gravitational field.

872
01:35:55,918 --> 01:35:59,420
The machine inhabitants found
it to be one of their own kind.

873
01:35:59,505 --> 01:36:02,089
Primitive, yet kindred.

874
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:05,468
They discovered its simple
20th-century programming.

875
01:36:05,552 --> 01:36:08,721
"Collect all data possible."

876
01:36:08,806 --> 01:36:10,431
"Learn all that is learnable."

877
01:36:12,726 --> 01:36:17,855
-Return that information to its Creator.
-Precisely, Mr Decker.

878
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:21,984
The machines interpreted it literally.
They built this entire vessel

879
01:36:22,069 --> 01:36:24,987
so that Voyagercould actually fulfil
its programming.

880
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:27,490
And on its journey back,

881
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:32,245
it amassed so much knowledge,

882
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:36,082
it achieved consciousness itself.

883
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:39,585
lt became a living thing.

884
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:58,271
Kirk-unit. V'Ger awaits the information.

885
01:37:00,274 --> 01:37:04,819
Enterprise, order up
the ship's computer library of records

886
01:37:04,903 --> 01:37:08,447
on the late 20th century
NASA probe, Voyager Vl.

887
01:37:08,532 --> 01:37:11,409
<i>Specifically,
we want the old NASA code signal</i>

888
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:13,870
<i>that instructs the
probe to transmit its data.</i>

889
01:37:13,954 --> 01:37:16,205
<i>-And fast, Uhura, fast!
-Aye, sir.</i>

890
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:20,585
That's what it's been signalling!
lts readiness to transmit its information!

891
01:37:20,669 --> 01:37:22,128
And there's no one on Earth

892
01:37:22,212 --> 01:37:24,839
who could recognise the old signal
and send a response.

893
01:37:24,923 --> 01:37:26,799
"The Creator does not answer."

894
01:37:37,561 --> 01:37:46,360
V'Ger.

895
01:37:48,447 --> 01:37:49,447
V'Ger!

896
01:37:54,411 --> 01:37:57,413
We are the Creator.

897
01:37:57,497 --> 01:38:01,500
That is not logical.
Carbon units are not true life forms.

898
01:38:01,585 --> 01:38:03,753
We will prove it.
We will make it possible

899
01:38:03,837 --> 01:38:06,797
for you to complete your programming.

900
01:38:06,882 --> 01:38:09,175
Only the Creator could accomplish that.

901
01:38:11,595 --> 01:38:12,929
<i>Enterprise.</i>

902
01:38:13,013 --> 01:38:15,848
We have just received the
response code, Captain.

903
01:38:15,933 --> 01:38:18,267
Set the Enterprise transmitter
on appropriate frequency

904
01:38:18,352 --> 01:38:20,770
and transmit the code now!

905
01:38:20,854 --> 01:38:23,189
<i>Transmitting.</i>

906
01:38:23,273 --> 01:38:28,152
5-0-4, 3-2-9,

907
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:32,949
3-1 -7, 5-1 -0,

908
01:38:33,033 --> 01:38:35,117
and the final sequence...

909
01:38:35,202 --> 01:38:37,536
That should trigger
Voyager's transmitter.

910
01:38:50,384 --> 01:38:53,052
Voyager is not transmitting
its data, Captain.

911
01:38:55,222 --> 01:38:57,348
The Creator must join with V'Ger.

912
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:02,561
Uhura! Repeat the final sequence.

913
01:39:07,484 --> 01:39:09,735
The Creator must join with V'Ger.

914
01:39:31,091 --> 01:39:33,217
Voyager is not transmitting, Captain,

915
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:36,262
because it did not receive
the final sequence.

916
01:39:36,346 --> 01:39:39,015
Jim! We're down to 1 0 minutes.

917
01:39:39,099 --> 01:39:40,683
Enterprise, stand by.

918
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:53,195
-The antenna leads are melted away.
-Yes, Captain, just now.

919
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:56,907
-By V'Ger itself.
-Why?

920
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:58,993
To prevent reception.

921
01:39:59,077 --> 01:40:05,583
Of course, to bring the Creator here
to finish transmitting the code in person.

922
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:12,131
To touch the Creator.

923
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:16,177
Capture God?

924
01:40:16,261 --> 01:40:19,096
V'Ger's liable to be in for one hell
of a disappointment.

925
01:40:19,181 --> 01:40:20,681
Perhaps not, Doctor.

926
01:40:44,206 --> 01:40:45,498
Captain.

927
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:54,131
V'Ger must evolve.

928
01:40:54,216 --> 01:40:56,592
lts knowledge has reached
the limits of this universe

929
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:58,344
and it must evolve.

930
01:40:58,428 --> 01:41:01,680
What it requires of its God, Doctor,
is the answer to its question,

931
01:41:01,765 --> 01:41:03,265
"ls there nothing more?"

932
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:06,018
What more is there
than the universe, Spock?

933
01:41:06,103 --> 01:41:08,104
Other dimensions,
higher levels of being.

934
01:41:08,188 --> 01:41:10,773
The existence of which cannot
be proven logically.

935
01:41:10,857 --> 01:41:14,110
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable
of believing in them.

936
01:41:14,194 --> 01:41:19,031
What V'Ger needs in order to evolve
is a human quality,

937
01:41:19,116 --> 01:41:20,950
our capacity to leap beyond logic.

938
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:28,124
And joining with its Creator
might accomplish that.

939
01:41:28,208 --> 01:41:32,169
You mean, this machine wants
to physically join with a human?

940
01:41:32,254 --> 01:41:33,712
ls that possible?

941
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:38,759
Let's find out.

942
01:41:47,894 --> 01:41:50,354
-Decker!
-l'm going to key the final sequence

943
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:51,647
through the ground test computer.

944
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:54,316
Decker, you don't know what
that'll do to you!

945
01:41:54,401 --> 01:41:55,734
Yes, l do, Doctor!

946
01:42:02,742 --> 01:42:03,951
Decker, don't!

947
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:06,745
Jim, l want this.

948
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:10,499
As much as you wanted the Enterprise,
l want this.

949
01:45:04,257 --> 01:45:05,466
Captain.

950
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:11,847
Spock, did we just see
the beginning of a new life form?

951
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:15,184
Yes, Captain. We witnessed a birth.

952
01:45:15,268 --> 01:45:19,688
-Possibly, a next step in our evolution.
-l wonder.

953
01:45:19,773 --> 01:45:22,608
Well, it's been a long time
since l delivered a baby,

954
01:45:22,692 --> 01:45:24,902
and l hope we got this one off
to a good start.

955
01:45:24,986 --> 01:45:27,488
l hope so, too.

956
01:45:27,572 --> 01:45:33,077
l think we gave it the ability to create
its own sense of purpose

957
01:45:33,161 --> 01:45:35,371
out of our own human weaknesses

958
01:45:36,915 --> 01:45:39,500
and the drive that compels us
to overcome.

959
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:43,379
And a lot of foolish human
emotions, right, Mr Spock?

960
01:45:43,463 --> 01:45:45,089
Quite true, Doctor.

961
01:45:45,173 --> 01:45:49,051
Unfortunately, it will have to
deal with them as well.

962
01:45:49,135 --> 01:45:50,886
lnterrogative from Starfleet.

963
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:52,846
They're requesting damage
and injury reports

964
01:45:52,931 --> 01:45:54,515
and complete vessel status.

965
01:45:54,599 --> 01:45:56,892
Report two casualties.

966
01:45:56,976 --> 01:46:00,896
Lieutenant llia. Captain Decker.

967
01:46:01,523 --> 01:46:04,608
-Aye, sir.
-Correction. They're not casualties.

968
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:06,610
They are...

969
01:46:09,656 --> 01:46:11,073
List them as missing.

970
01:46:12,325 --> 01:46:15,160
-Vessel status, fully operational.
-Aye, sir.

971
01:46:16,496 --> 01:46:17,830
Mr Scott!

972
01:46:18,665 --> 01:46:21,500
Shall we give the Enterprise
a proper shakedown?

973
01:46:21,751 --> 01:46:24,586
l would say it's time for that, sir. Aye.

974
01:46:24,671 --> 01:46:27,506
We can have you back on Vulcan
in four days, Mr Spock.

975
01:46:27,799 --> 01:46:32,511
Unnecessary, Mr Scott.
My task on Vulcan is completed.

976
01:46:34,013 --> 01:46:37,266
-Mr Sulu, ahead warp 1 .
-Warp 1 , sir.

977
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:38,892
Heading, sir?

978
01:46:43,106 --> 01:46:44,314
Out there.
