00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,420
我愿意
I do.

5
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,000
去保护她免受已知和未知恐怖的侵害
To shield from terrors known and unknown?

6
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,400
-去撒谎  去欺骗...  -什么
- To lie, to deceive... - What?

7
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,300
去过双面生活  无法阻止她被绑架
To live a double life, to fail to prevent her abduction,

8
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,230
抹去她的身份  逼她隐于人世

00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,350
-夺走她所知的一切  -停

10
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,460
-用自私  徒劳  暂时的方式  -停
- ...in a selfish, futile, fleeting attempt... - Stop.

11
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,290
来逃避你真正的自我
...to escape your own true self?

12
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,310
求你了  停下
Please, stop.

13
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,130
茱莉亚  你选择接受吗
And, Julia, do you choose to accept?

14
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,020
别
Don't.

15
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,600
-我接受  -不
- I do. - No.

16
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,320
你该杀了我的  伊森

命运对勇士低语
Fate whispers to the warrior...

19
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,110
风暴将至
A storm is coming.

20
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,720
勇士低声回应
And the warrior whispers back...

21
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,480
我即风暴

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,110
晚上好  亨特先生
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

25
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,160
无政府主义者所罗门·莱恩
The anarchist Solomon Lane.

26
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,560
自从你两年前抓捕他之后
Since you captured him 2 years ago,

27
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,590
他的消失带来了意料之外的后果
his absence from the world stage has had unintended consequences.

28
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,600
他曾领导的由变节特工组成的辛迪加组织

29
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,150

一直在坚持不懈地追捕莱恩的特工网络
has relentlessly hunted Lane's elite network of hostiles.

32
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,980
但还是有很多人未知或在逃

33
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,830
这个极端分裂组织剩余的成员
The remnants of this extremist splinter cell

34
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,770
自称「使徒」

35
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,760
使徒

36
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,560
他们采取了"雇佣恐袭"策略
They have since adopted a policy of terror-for-hire,

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,730
让他们成为了更大的威胁
making them an even greater threat.

38
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,400
最近在印控克什米尔和中巴边界

39
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,890
爆发的天花疫情

克什米尔

41
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,220
就是他们的手笔
along the borders of China and Pakistan,

42
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,770
全球三分之一的人口都受到了威胁
threatening one-third of the world's population.

43
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,840
疫情已经得到了控制
The epidemic is being contained,

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,250
但情报显示
but intelligence would indicate

45
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,310
已经有一个新客户雇佣了使徒
that a new client has hired the Apostles

46
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,540
来执行更庞大的行动
for a more ambitious operation.

47
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,610
此人曾联系过他们
They have been contacted by this man,

48
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,000
一个信息不详的极端分子
an unidentified extremist

49
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,050
约翰·拉克

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,650
只知其代号是"约翰·拉克"
known only by the code name John Lark,

51
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,610
他撰写了这份末日宣言
author of this apocalyptic manifesto

52
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,640
呼吁人们摧毁当前的世界秩序
calling for the destruction of the current world order.

53
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,240
所有的和平  都需要伟大的牺牲

54
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,720
据推测挪威核武器专家
It is believed Lark is responsible for the disappearance

55
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,380
尼尔斯·德布朗克的失踪就与拉克有关
of Norwegian nuclear weapons specialist Nils Delbruuk.

56
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,420
尼尔斯·德布朗克

57
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,450
德布朗克博士的安全权限
Dr. Delbruuk's security clearance was revoked

58
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,610
在他发表了极度反宗教言论后就被取消了
after he expressed fiercely anti-religious views.

59
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,440
与此同时  使徒一直和
Meanwhile, the Apostles have been in contact

60
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,980
使徒

61
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,780
东欧地下世界的成员有联系
with elements of the Eastern European underworld,

62
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,250
他们手中有三枚从俄罗斯东部
who are in possession of three plutonium cores

63
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,880
一个导弹基地偷取的三颗钚核
stolen from a missile base in eastern Russia.

64
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,280
这意味着约翰·拉克和使徒
This would indicate that John Lark and the Apostles

65
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,860
正在协作  试图获得可用的核武器
are working together to acquire functioning nuclear weapons.

66
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,770
核事件应急支援小组预计  以德布朗克的水平
NEST estimates that a man with Delbruuk's knowledge,

67
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,290
使用获得的材料
using the materials in play,

68
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,250
他可以在72小时内造出三枚核武器
could complete three nuclear weapons in as little as 72 hours.

69
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,270
这些装置将是手提式的
These devices would be man-portable

70
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,760
一夜之间就能被安放到世界的任意角落
and deployable anywhere on Earth overnight.

71
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,590
这些武器在约翰·拉克和使徒手里
In the hands of John Lark and the Apostles,

72
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,990
将对数以百万计的人
these weapons represent an unprecedented threat

73
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,720
造成前所未有的威胁
to countless millions.

74
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,750
你的任务  若你选择接受
Your mission, should you choose to accept it,

75
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,240
就是阻止使徒拿到钚核
is to prevent the Apostles from acquiring plutonium

76
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,950
使徒

77
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,430
不择一切手段
using any means at your disposal.

78
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,800
如果你或任何你的IMF组员被捕或被杀
If you or any members of your IMF team are caught or killed,

79
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,990
部长都会否认对你们的行动知情
the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.

80
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,030
祝你好运  伊森
Good luck, Ethan.

81
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,210
本条信息将在五秒后自毁
This message will self-destruct in five seconds.

82
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,070
柏林

83
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,250
他迟到了
He's late.

84
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,620
-他从来不迟到的  -他会来的
- He's never late. - He'll be here.

85
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,930
我感觉很不好
I don't like it.

86
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,950
这家伙身上有什么东西让我不安
Something about this guy just really gives me the creeps.

87
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,840
好了  放松
Okay, just relax.

88
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,360
我很放松
I'm relaxed.

89
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,580
你听起来不像是放松的样子
You don't sound relaxed.

90
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,550
路德  他听起来放松吗
Luther, does he sound relaxed to you?

91
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,070
他听起来害怕极了
He sounds terrified.

92
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,190
拜托  我没有害怕
Please, I'm not terrified.

93
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,980
我只是有种不祥的预感
I just have a bad feeling is all.

94
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,780
你刚刚不是说你很放松吗
I thought you said you were relaxed.

95
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,180
放松的同时又极度不安
It's entirely possible to be relaxed and extremely uneasy

96
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,370
是完全有可能的
at the same time.

97
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,290
-不  不可能  -你就总这样
- No, it's not. - You do it all the time.

98
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,810
-不  我没有  -你就是
- No, I don't. - Yes, you do.

99
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,550
不  他没有
No, he doesn't.

100
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,850
你想让我相信你现在完全放松
I'm supposed to believe that you are perfectly relaxed,

101
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,240
-此时此地...  -班吉
- right here, now... - Benji.

102
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,700
在一条黑暗的小巷里  等着从一个变态手中
...in a dark alleyway, waiting to buy black-market plutonium

103
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,200
买黑市钚核
from a psychopath.

104
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,750
班吉  我不会让你出事的
Benji, I won't let anything happen to you.

105
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,560
-好把  -瞧吧  班吉 你非常安全
- Okay. - See, Benji, you're perfectly safe.

106
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,010
你说得轻松  你可是坐在车里
That's easy for you to say, you're in the van.

107
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,170
是你想出外勤的  "硬汉"
Well, you wanted to be in the field, tough guy.

108
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,350
但今晚  路德  我想待在车里
And tonight, Luther, I would like to be in the van!

109
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,320
他来了
He's here.

110
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,340
天呐
Oh, God.

111
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,550
准备好钱  路德
Have that money ready, Luther.

112
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,410
收到
Copy.

113
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,960
伊森  你能收到吗
Ethan, do you copy?

114
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,120
你能收到吗
Do you copy?

115
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,090
我们到底还做不做交易了
Are we finally gonna do this or not?

116
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,110
我能在这行生存下来
I have survived in this business

117
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,250
全靠我脑海中的一个声音
with the help of a voice in my head.

118
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,560
这个声音从来不出错  而无论我何时遇到你
This voice is never wrong. And whenever I meet you,

119
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,400
它总会跟我说同一句话
it tells me the same thing.

120
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,020
什么
What's that?

121
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,060
什么都没有
Nothing.

122
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,710
我是来做生意的  让你的声音扔硬币决定吧
I'm here to do business. Tell the voice to flip a coin.

123
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,620
那是什么
What's that?

124
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,220
这是根铍棒
This is a beryllium rod,

125
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,940
它引发里面的钚产生了反应
which is causing a reaction with the plutonium inside the core.

126
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,880
没问题
That's them.

127
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,150
钱呢
The money?

128
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,590
钱
The money.

129
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,790
把钱拿过来
Bring the money.

130
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,040
路德  把钱拿过来
Luther, bring the money.

131
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,800
我们需要那笔钱  路德
We're gonna need that money, Luther.

132
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,390
杀了他们
Kill them.

133
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,110
我来拿
I got it!

134
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,740
路德  你能收到吗
Luther, do you copy?

135
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,640
路德
Luther!

136
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,350
路德  快回话
Luther, come in.

137
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,620
路德现在不在
Luther's not here right now.

138
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,780
使徒能为你做什么  亨特
What can the Apostles do for you, Hunt?

139
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,760
-你们想要什么  -你们被包围了  亨特
- What do you want? - You're boxed in, Hunt.

140
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,990
把钚给我们  然后离开
Give us the plutonium and walk away.

141
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,500
班吉  把车开来
Benji, get the car.

142
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,850
我可能做不到
I don't think I can do that.

143
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,610
班吉  把车开来
Benji, get the car.

144
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,720
我们跟你做个交易  亨特
We'll make you a deal, Hunt.

145
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,390
把钚给我们  我们就不杀你的朋友
Give us the plutonium and we won't kill your friend.

146
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,240
别  伊森  别为了我这么做
Don't you do it, Ethan! Not for me!

147
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,300
我数到三
I'm gonna count to three.

148
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,710
一
One.

149
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,710
-二  -路德
- Two. - Luther...

150
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,280
-对不起  -三
- I'm sorry. - Three.

151
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,670
对不起  我不知道还能怎么办
I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do.

152
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,690
我不会放在心上的
We're good.

153
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,110
-你还好吗  -我本该已经死了
- You okay? - I should be dead.

154
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,590
我们都该已经死了
We should all be dead.

155
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,950
为什么我们没有死
Why aren't we?

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,540
钚核呢
Where's the plutonium?

157
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,580
不在了
It's gone.

158
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,640
如果您刚刚打开电视
If you're just joining us,

159
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,030
三起大爆炸事件同时发生
three massive explosions have gone off simultaneously

160
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:56,570
突发新闻  三起核武器袭击

161
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,860
目前看来是联合恐怖袭击
in what appears to be a coordinated attack.

162
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,090
这是从罗马拍摄到的梵蒂冈的实时画面
This image is live in Rome, looking toward the Vatican

163
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,500
而这是我们的镜头能到达的最近距离了
and is as close as our cameras can get.

164
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,740
据消息称  爆炸发生时
It is believed that the Pope was in residence

165
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,990
教皇正位于他的居所内
at the time of the blast.

166
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,280
这是从耶路撒冷城外拍摄到的城内的实时画面
Also live, we're looking at Jerusalem from just outside the city.

167
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,550
接下来是圣城麦加的实时画面
Also live, the holy city of Mecca

168
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,050
是停靠在沙特阿拉伯附近的红海上的
from the USS Ronald Reagan in the Red Sea

169
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,400
里根号航空母舰拍摄到的
off the coast of Saudi Arabia.

170
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,480
已经探测到了核辐射
Radiation has been detected,

171
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,690
意味着这些令人震惊的袭击
indicating that nuclear weapons were used

172
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,550
使用了核武器
in these unspeakable attacks.

173
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,490
-伊森  时间到了  -目前虽没有具体伤亡数字
- Ethan, it's time. - No word on casualties yet,

174
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,910
但我们可以预计
but we can assume

175
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,050
死亡人数将是灾难级的
the death toll is catastrophic.

176
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,330
初期报告显示  制造袭击中使用的武器
Early reports suggest the weapons used

177
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,980
需要极其专业的知识
would require highly specialized knowledge

178
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,240
而只有极少数人具备这样的知识
that very few people possess.

179
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,050
现在的问题是  谁会同时袭击这三座宗教圣城
The question now is who would attack all three of these holy sites?

180
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,280
以及为什么
And why?

181
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,380
三起袭击精确地发生在同一时刻
The attacks occurred at precisely the same moment,

182
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,770
就在一个多小时前
just over an hour ago,

183
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,520
东部时间凌晨4点
at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

184
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,080
爆炸发生几分钟内
Within minutes of the attack,

185
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,460
国会紧急休会
Congress ordered an emergency recess

186
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,560
国会大厦被疏散
and the Capitol Building was evacuated.

187
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,290
总统乘坐空军一号离开了华盛顿
The President left Washington on Air Force One.

188
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,740
白宫宣布进入紧急状态
The White House has declared a state of emergency,

189
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,160
命令军队处于最高戒备
placing the military on highest alert.

190
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,040
能让我们单独待会儿吗  谢谢
Would you excuse us, please?

191
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,560
德布朗克博士
Dr. Delbruuk.

192
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,560
我们知道你是谁
We know who you are.

193
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,160
我们看了宣言  也找到了你的实验室
We read the manifesto, we found your lab.

194
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,360
机密

195
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,290
"所有的和平
"There has never been peace

196
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,230
都需要伟大的牺牲
"without first a great suffering.

197
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,010
牺牲越大  和平越久"
"The greater the suffering, the greater the peace."

198
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,070
这能让他们团结起来  知道吗
See, this will unite them. Hmm?

199
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,150
他们读到这份宣言的时候就会懂的
When they read this manifesto, they'll all understand.

200
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,820
永远都不会有人读到这份宣言
Nobody's gonna read that manifesto, ever.

201
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,620
我可以向你保证
I can promise you that.

202
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,120
今天是几号
What day is it?

203
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,760
我在这儿多久了
How long have I been here?

204
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,900
你记得的最后一件事是什么
What's the last thing you remember?

205
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,440
我在开车
I was driving.

206
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:51,810
有人撞了我
Someone hit me.

207
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,300
那是两周前了
That was two weeks ago.

208
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,890
-两周  -两周
- Two weeks? - Two weeks.

209
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,870
这是你的  是不是
This is yours, isn't it?

210
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,280
拉克就是用这个跟你联系的
It's how Lark communicated with you.

211
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,510
-拉克  -约翰·拉克
- Lark? - John Lark.

212
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,570
-我们知道关于他的一切  -你们什么都不知道
- We know all about him. - You know nothing.

213
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,500
这手机上有线索能帮我们找到他
There's information in this phone that could lead us to him.

214
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,270
而你知道密码
And you have the passcode.

215
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,440
你们觉得拉克是敌人  是吗
You think Lark is the enemy, hmm?

216
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,490
但你们
But you,

217
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,090
无论你们是谁  你们才是敌人
well, whoever you are, you are the enemy.

218
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,380
你们才是这个体制得以苟存的原因
You're why the system survives.

219
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,830
-劫难不断持续的原因  -闭嘴
- Why the suffering goes on. - Shut up!

220
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,580
我们不在乎你  我们只想抓到拉克
We don't care about you. We want Lark.

221
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,770
我们做个交易如何
What if we make a deal?

222
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,680
不  没有交易  路德
No, there's no deal, Luther.

223
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,940
出去一下
Step outside.

224
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,720
让我和这家伙待五分钟
Give me five minutes with this guy.

225
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,050
伊森  我不能让你这么做  我们不是这样的人
Ethan, I can't let you do that. That's not who we are.

226
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,430
或许我们该重新考虑这一点了
Then maybe we need to reconsider that.

227
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,500
如果他们在电视上宣读这份宣言呢
What if they read the manifesto on the air?

228
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,380
什么  你能做到这个
What? You can do that?

229
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,320
我们打个电话就能做到
We can do it with a phone call.

230
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,100
如果他宣读了拉克的宣言...
Well, if he reads Lark's manifesto...

231
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,930
不行
No.

232
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,010
我就把密码给你
I'll give you the passcode.

233
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,320
伊森  伊森
Ethan! Ethan!

234
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,710
想想  伊森
Think, Ethan.

235
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,840
为了大局着想  拜托
Think of the greater good, please.

236
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,250
没错  只要你们这么做就行
Yeah, you do that.

237
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,040
长官
Sir.

238
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,310
不  他不愿意合作
No, he won't cooperate.

239
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,490
是的  长官  除非我们宣读那份宣言
Yes, sir. If we read the manifesto

240
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,480
在直播中读
on the air.

241
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,710
我很抱歉  长官
I'm sorry, sir.

242
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,940
贸易以及全球市场大幅下跌
Trading and global markets plummeted.

243
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,360
等等  我刚收到消息
Stand by. I'm told

244
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,670
我们有一些额外的消息要报道
we're about to get some additional information.

245
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,480
我刚刚拿到了一份来自尼尔斯·德布朗克的文件
I've just been handed a document from Nils Delbruuk,

246
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,520
他是一位核武器专家
a nuclear weapons specialist

247
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,260
并声称自己是袭击中所使用的武器的制造者
who claims to have built the weapons used in these attacks.

248
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,360
我被要求完整朗读这份宣言
I've been asked to read this manifesto in its entirety.

249
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,870
"所有的和平  都需要伟大的牺牲
"There has never been peace without first a great suffering."

250
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,980
牺牲越大  和平越久
"The greater the suffering, the greater the peace."

251
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,130
人类正在走上自毁之途
"As mankind is drawn to his self-destruction"

252
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,920
犹如飞蛾扑火般
"like a moth to the candle,"

253
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,860
那些所谓的和平捍卫者
"the so-called defenders of peace,"

254
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,890
教会  政府  法律
"the church, the government, the law,"

255
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,020
孜孜不倦地阻止人类自毁"
"work tirelessly to save humanity from itself."

256
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,700
现在你们要这些也没用了
It's not gonna help you now.

257
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,450
"但为了避免灾难
"But by averting disaster,"

258
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,180
他们选择推迟..."
"they serve to delay a peace..."

259
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,010
木已成舟
What's done is done.

260
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,410
"只有经过火的洗礼才能最终诞生的和平
"...that can only come through an inevitable baptism of fire."

261
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,000
我带给你们的灾难不是末日的开始
"The suffering I bring you is not the beginning of the end."

262
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,620
而是一个更好的  互相理解的世界的开始"
"It is the beginning of a greater mutual understanding..."

263
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,840
拿到了吗
Did we get it?

264
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,980
"这是迈向人类终极团结的第一步"
"It is the first step toward the ultimate brotherhood of man."

265
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,940
拿到了
We got it.

266
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,630
"我带给你们的灾难
"The suffering I bring you"

267
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,790
是通往终极和平的桥梁"
"is the bridge to ultimate peace."

268
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,180
撤
Go.

269
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,810
拿到了吗
Did we get it?

270
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,750
当然拿到了
Of course we got it.

271
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,630
我就说我们会拿到的
I told you we'd get it.

272
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,250
我不明白
I don't understand.

273
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,190
袭击还没发生吗
The attacks didn't happen?

274
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,150
你是在一小时之前出的车祸
The car accident you were in, that was an hour ago.

275
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,160
撞你的那辆车就是我开的
I was driving the other car.

276
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,350
木是不是已经成了舟
What's done is done,

277
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,500
那得我们说了算
when we say it's done.

278
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,590
碟中谍6: 全面瓦解

279
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:27,440
德国  拉姆施泰因空军基地

280
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,000
长官
Sir.

281
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,470
你解锁的那个手机让我们找到了一个冰岛的服务器
That phone you unlocked led us to a server in Iceland

282
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,160
我们成功解码了一份
where we managed to decrypt a communique

283
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,860
约翰·拉克和这个女人之间的公报
between John Lark and this woman:

284
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,870
阿拉娜·米索普利斯  活动家以及慈善家
Alana Mitsopolis, activist and philanthropist,

285
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,630
她进行的慈善活动
whose charity work

286
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,150
让她得到了白寡妇的绰号
has earned her the nickname the White Widow.

287
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,090
这些都是为了掩护她真正的交易
It's all a front for her real trade:

288
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,930
武器贸易  洗钱
arms dealing, money laundering.

289
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,610
广泛的政府关系也为她提供了保护
Extensive political connections provide her with protection.

290
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,030
拉克和寡妇今晚要碰面
Lark and the Widow are meeting tonight

291
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,290
来协商关于某个未知包裹的交付问题
to negotiate delivery of an unspecified package,

292
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,920
我们只能假设这个包裹是我们丢失的钚核
which we can only assume is our missing plutonium.

293
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,260
他们会在巴黎大皇宫的私人会所碰头
They'll make contact in a private lounge at the Grand Palais in Paris

294
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,630
她会在那里举办她的年度筹款活动
during her annual fundraising event.

295
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,000
细节全在文件里
The details are in the file.

296
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,830
如果拉克在午夜12点还没有出现
If Lark isn't there by midnight,

297
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,280
白寡妇就会离开
the Widow will leave

298
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,180
并且把包裹出售给出价最高者
and sell the package to the highest bidder.

299
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,800
你还剩两小时来找到拉克
Which gives you two hours from now to find Lark.

300
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,170
长官  我想有些事情你需要知道
Sir, I think there's something you need to know.

301
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,870
-我...  -我必须马上打断你
- I... - I'm gonna stop you right there

302
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,480
你在柏林时面临的是艰难的选择
You had a terrible choice to make in Berlin:

303
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,400
是保住钚核还是去救你的队员
Recover the plutonium or save your team.

304
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,270
你选择了队员  现在整个世界都陷入了危机
You chose your team, and now the world is at risk.

305
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,500
你自身本质的某些缺陷
Some flaw deep in your core being

306
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,100
让你无法在一条命和数百万条生命之间抉择
simply won't allow you to choose between one life and millions.

307
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,560
你认为这是你的弱点
You see that as a sign of weakness.

308
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,160
但对我而言  这正是你最强大的力量
To me, that's your greatest strength.

309
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,230
这也说明有朝一日我可以指望你来救我的命
It also tells me I can count on you to cover my ass.

310
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,400
因为虽然从中情局调来这里是平级调动
Because coming over here from the CIA was a lateral move,

311
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,380
也有人说是降职了
some say a step down.

312
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,590
但我还是到这里来了
But I did it

313
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,600
因为你
because of you.

314
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,120
别让我后悔
Don't make me regret it.

315
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,400
打电话
Make the call.

316
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,120
把飞机停下
Shut 'em down.

317
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,650
你以为你在干什么  艾瑞卡
What do you think you're doing, Erika?

318
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,110
这个任务可能是你的
It may be your mission,

319
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,220
但这架飞机是中情局的
but this is the CIA's plane.

320
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,190
没我的允许  它就不能起飞
It doesn't take off without my say-so.

321
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,330
我没时间跟你争
We don't have time for this.

322
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,290
我在巴黎的小队已经准备好了
I have a team in Paris ready to grab Lark

323
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,030
拉克一离开大楼我们就会抓住他
as soon as he leaves the building.

324
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,950
一架G5飞机会把他引渡到关塔那摩监狱
A G5 standing by to rendition him to Gitmo,

325
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,220
我们会在那里拷问他
where a waterboard is waiting.

326
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,940
花上无谓的24小时来问出一份我们无法相信的口供
Spend 24 hours we don't have to pull a confession we can't trust

327
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,890
供述者还连身份都不能确定  我不认同这方案
from a man we haven't positively identified? No.

328
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,910
我们需要可靠的情报  现在就要
We need reliable intelligence, and we need it now.

329
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,660
IMF的存在就是为了处理这种情况
This scenario is precisely why the IMF exists!

330
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,940
IMF就是万圣节闹剧  艾伦
The IMF is Halloween, Alan.

331
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,480
一群成年人戴着面具在玩不给糖就捣蛋
A bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick-or-treat.

332
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,380
如果他在柏林时能保住钚核
And if he had held on to the plutonium in Berlin,

333
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,540
我们也不用在这里争了
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

334
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,910
但那样他的队员就会死
And his team would be dead.

335
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,980
确实  他们会死
Yes. They would.

336
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,660
那就是职责所在
That's the job.

337
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,860
正因此我才希望现场有一个我的人
And that's why I want one of my own men on the scene

338
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,120
来评估情况
to appraise the situation.

339
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,780
沃克特工  来自特别行动组
Agent Walker, Special Activities.

340
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,990
他的名声我早有耳闻
His reputation precedes.

341
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,930
你习惯用手术刀
You use a scalpel.

342
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,490
我更喜欢用锤子
I prefer a hammer.

343
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,110
我不同意
The answer is no.

344
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,740
我有直接来自总统的行动授权
I have operational authority here, direct from the President.

345
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,270
你要是有异议  就自己去找他
You have a problem with that, you take it up with him.

346
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,080
我已经找过了  他也同意了
I have already, and he agrees with me.

347
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,740
要么我的人跟着去  要么谁都别想去
My man goes or no one goes.

348
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,890
绝不能让任何人阻止你拿到钚核
No one comes between you and that plutonium.

349
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,370
亨特不能  他的队员不能  任何人都不能
Not Hunt, not his team, not anyone.

350
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,670
白寡妇在政府各层都有眼线
The White Widow has spies at every level of government.

351
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,720
这架飞机伪装成了商用客机
This plane is posing as a commercial airliner

352
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,440
这样我们就能跳伞进入法国境内而不被发现
so we can jump into France undetected.

353
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,380
她和拉克会于午夜12点在贵宾厅见面
The Widow's meeting Lark in the VIP lounge at midnight.

354
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,910
没有预先发放的电子手环  任何人都不能进去
No one will be admitted without a pre-issued electronic I.D. band.

355
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,350
我们已经拿到了拉克手环上的射频识别码
We have acquired the unique RFID number for Lark's band,

356
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,160
这样我们就可以定位他
allowing us to locate it

357
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,960
用这些
with these.

358
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,240
找到那个手环  就找到了拉克
Find that I.D. band, you find Lark.

359
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,440
然后呢
Then what?

360
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,560
然后...
Then...

361
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,940
我借用他的身份来与白寡妇联系
I assume his identity and make contact with the Widow.

362
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,820
让她领着我们找到包裹
She takes us to the package.

363
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,490
真的有人信你这烂招吗
People actually fall for this shit?

364
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,900
你准备怎么让拉克合作
How do you intend to make Lark cooperate?

365
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,650
我在人群中撞他一下
I bump him in the crowd.

366
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,950
不出十秒  他就会跟派对上的其他醉汉一样
In ten seconds he'll look like any other drunk at the party,

367
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,280
语无伦次  毫无还手之力
incoherent and completely pliable.

368
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,390
我装成他的样子之后
After I borrow his face,

369
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,460
你就带他走出前门
you walk him out the front door

370
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,580
把他交给斯隆的撤离小队
and hand him to Sloane's extraction team.

371
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,520
你可别想这么轻易就甩掉我  亨特
You're not getting rid of me that easily, Hunt.

372
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,050
我这么做不是为了甩掉你
That's not what this is about.

373
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,550
当然就是
Sure it is.

374
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,700
我知道你不想让我插手这次的行动
I know you don't want me on this detail.

375
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,350
但我们还是面对现实吧
But let's face it:

376
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,440
如果你在柏林能狠一狠心
If you'd made the hard choice in Berlin,

377
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,000
我就不会在这里了
I wouldn't be here.

378
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,220
如果你没有击毙
And if you hadn't gunned down

379
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,830
他们派你去追查的每一个辛迪加特工
every Syndicate agent they sent you to find,

380
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,330
我也不用出现在这里了
I wouldn't be here.

381
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,690
没错  我知道关于你的一切
That's right, I know all about you.

382
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,200
就是因为你  我们才没有活着的证人
You're why we don't have a living witness

383
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,380
能来指认约翰·拉克或者使徒
who can identify John Lark or the Apostles.

384
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,060
如果你对我的方法有意见
If you have a problem with my methods,

385
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,940
你可以一直留在后方
you can always stay behind.

386
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,870
"你的任务  由你来决定是否接受"
"Your mission, should you choose to accept it."

387
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,360
是这么说的吧
Isn't that the thing?

388
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,170
两分钟之后开始减压
Two minutes to decompression.

389
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,820
穿上装备  白寡妇半小时后就要跟拉克会面了
Suit up. The Widow is meeting Lark in 30 minutes.

390
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,460
十秒钟之后开始减压
Ten seconds to decompression.

391
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,350
你的氧气开了吗
Is your oxygen on?

392
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,490
这个海拔高度大气稀薄
There is no atmosphere at this altitude.

393
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,480
我可不希望你晕过去
I don't need you blacking out on me.

394
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,050
你头盔上的屏幕有内置的导航系统
Your heads-up display has a built-in guidance system.

395
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,420
跟着它降落到目的地
Follow it to the target.

396
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,090
系统告诉你开伞时你再开
Open your chute when the system says,

397
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,160
不许早也不许晚
not before and definitely not after,

398
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,680
否则最后经过你大脑的
or the last thing that goes through your mind

399
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,610
就是你的膝盖骨  明白了吗
will be your kneecaps. Is that clear?

400
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,470
明白
Crystal.

401
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,160
我们需要谈谈  需要重新制定计划
We got to talk. We need to rethink this.

402
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,370
别挡路  亨特
Out of my way, Hunt.

403
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,290
沃克  现在有问题
Walker, we've got a problem.

404
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,790
外面风暴肆虐  我们需要...
There's a storm. We need to...

405
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,520
别说了
Enough talk.

406
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,080
巴黎见
I'll see you in Paris.

407
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,520
拜托  拜托  拜托
Come on, come on, come on.

408
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,150
海拔  25000英尺
Altitude: 25,000 feet.

409
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,910
沃克
Walker?

410
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,210
怎么了  亨特  这点闪电就让你怕了吗
What's the matter, Hunt? You afraid of a little lightning?

411
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,790
海拔  20000英尺
Altitude: 20,000 feet.

412
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,320
该死的
Son of a bitch.

413
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,400
沃克
Walker?

414
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,250

00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,940
沃克

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,200
沃克
Walker.

417
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,630

420
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:16,850
沃克

421
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,040
沃克
Walker!

422
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,180
沃克

423
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,590
海拔  10000英尺

9000英尺
9,000.

425
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,920
见鬼
Oh, shit.

426
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,860
8000英尺
8,000.

430
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,180
4000英尺
4,000.

431
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,150
沃克
Walker!

432
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,730
沃克
Walker!

433
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,890
3000英尺
3,000.

434
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,390
开伞  开伞  开伞
Deploy. Deploy. Deploy.

435
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,320
开伞  开伞
Deploy. Deploy.

436
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,220
天呐
Oh, God.

437
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,860
看来你氧气断了啊
Looks like you lost your oxygen.

438
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,810
白寡妇和拉克就在那里碰头
That's where the Widow is meeting Lark.

439
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,430
伊森
Ethan.

440
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,200
-沃克  -伊森  如果你能听见我说话
- Walker. - Ethan, if you can hear me,

441
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,330
我找到他了
I've got him.

442
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,660
再说一遍  哪里
Say again. Where?

443
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,220
他朝洗手间去了
He's headed for the bathroom.

444
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,590
-针剂在哪  -不需要了
- Where's the needle? - Didn't need it.

445
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,650
把他抬起来
Get him up.

446
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,030
别害羞嘛  人多更好玩

447
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,050
开门嘛  我们没有恶意的

448
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,330
-我们能加入你们吗  -我们不会咬人的

449
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,980
该死
Shit.

450
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,720
-你还能做面具吗  -我至少得有张脸啊
- Can you still make a mask? - I need a face to make a mask.

451
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,180
抱歉  我本来瞄准的是他的胸口
Sorry. I was aiming for his chest.

452
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,830
-你在这里干什么  -我也很高兴再见到你
- What are you doing here? - It's good to see you, too.

453
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,400
抱歉  我糊涂了  你是...
I'm sorry, I'm confused. You are...

454
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,710
一位老朋友
An old friend.

455
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,420
取消撤离小队  目标已死亡
Cancel extraction. We're code blue.

456
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,920
派清理人员来
Send sanitation.

457
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,490
北侧男洗手间
North men's room.

458
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,020
你没有回答我的问题  你在这里干什么
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing here?

459
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,680
就这样  放轻松  就是这样
That's it. Just take it easy. That's it.

460
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,660
保持抬头的姿势直到停止出血为止
Just keep your head back until the bleeding stops.

461
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,960
有问题吗
What is it? Eh?

462
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,270
你们也想试试吗

463
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,600
你在这里不是巧合  谁派你来的
You're not here by accident. Who sent you?

464
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,720
我不能告诉你
I can't tell you that.

465
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,790
你要干什么
What are you doing?

466
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,100
我和那个白寡妇有个约会
I have a date with the White Widow.

467
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,070
是他和那个寡妇有个约会  而你长得一点也不像他
He had a date with the Widow. You look nothing like him.

468
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,280
现在我们只能希望他们从未见过面了
And now we have to hope they never met.

469
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,370
-希望可不是什么策略  -你一定是新来的
- Hope is not a strategy! - Oh, you must be new.

470
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,390
我别无选择
I have no other choice.

471
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,990
白寡妇是我们唯一的线索
The White Widow's our only lead.

472
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,970
我必须假扮成这家伙5分钟
I got to be this guy for five minutes.

473
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,780
-不要这么做  -什么
- Don't do it. - What?

474
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,960
到底怎么了  你向我隐瞒了什么
What is it? What aren't you telling me?

475
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,410
你并不清楚你被卷入了什么麻烦
You don't understand what you're involved in.

476
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,650
我不清楚我被卷入了什么
I don't understand what I'm involved in.

477
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,960
我不清楚我被卷入了什么
I don't understand what I'm involved in?

478
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,310
我到底被卷入了什么
What am I involved in?

479
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,750
如果你要和寡妇见面  她3分钟后就走了
If you're meeting the Widow, she leaves in three minutes.

480
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,060
-伊森  -我会搞定的
- Ethan! - I'll make it work.

481
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,070
-伊森  -我会搞定的
- Ethan! - I'll make it work.

482
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,560
我叫沃克
The name's Walker.

483
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,900
是吗  不用谢
Yeah? You're welcome.

484
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:21,950
你以为你在干什么
What do you think you're doing?

485
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,690
-我和你一起去  -不行
- I'm going with you. - Like hell you are.

486
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,460
有一些人被派来杀拉克
People have been sent here to kill Lark.

487
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,050
可不是嘛
No shit.

488
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,880
不  不是我  是那些合约杀手和雇佣杀手
No, not me. Contractors. Paid assassins.

489
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,970
他们不知道他长什么样
They don't know what he looks like,

490
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,710
他们只知道他半夜要和寡妇见面
they only know he's meeting the Widow at midnight.

491
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,020
如果你这么做
If you go through with this,

492
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,970
他们会认为你就是拉克
they're gonna believe you're Lark

493
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,530
然后杀了你
and they're gonna kill you.

494
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,330
你怎么知道这些的
How do you know all this?

495
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,130
我不能告诉你
I can't tell you that.

496
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,650
你应该彻底金盆洗手的
You should've stayed out of the game.

497
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,520
你当初应该跟我一起走的
You should've come with me.

498
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,600
这场慈善晚会是为了纪念我的母亲而举办的
This charity was started in honor of my mother.

499
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,530
你们中认识她的人都了解她的力量
Those of you who knew her understood her strength,

500
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,490
她的坚韧  她的足智多谋
her tenacity, her resourcefulness.

501
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,820
但她还有着另外一面
But there was another side to her,

502
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,150
大多数人从未见过的一面
a side most people never saw.

503
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,070
正是她精神中的那一部分
It is that part of her spirit that has brought us

504
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,810
让我们今晚齐聚一堂
all together tonight.

505
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:22,400
麦克丝有点自相矛盾
Max was something of a paradox.

506
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,880
她对矛盾非常着迷
She had a fascination for paradoxes,

507
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,740
而这种情感传承到了我身上
a fascination she passed on to me.

508
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,700
麦克丝看透了我们现在生活的这个世界
Max had no illusions about the world we live in today.

509
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,820
但她梦想着能有一个截然不同的未来
But she had dreams of a very different future.

510
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,480
一个不再需要她独特才能的世界
One in which her unique talents were no longer required.

511
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,070
她从这个世界的方式中所获得的一切
All she earned from the way the world is

512
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,640
最终都是为了让它成为将来可能成为的样子
went ultimately to making it what it could someday be.

513
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,600
那样的未来还没有到来
That future isn't here yet.

514
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,960
而今晚  你们的慷慨捐赠
Tonight, your contributions

515
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,890
让我们离那个世界更近了一步
have brought it just a little closer.

516
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,880
感谢大家的光临
Thank you all for coming.

517
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,750
请享受这场盛宴
Enjoy the party.

518
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,240
你不可能是约翰·拉克
You can't possibly be John Lark.

519
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,500
实际上  我并不是
I'm not, actually.

520
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,110
那只是个化名
It's an alias.

521
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,890
或许它至少比无名氏要好
I suppose it's better than John Doe.

522
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,410
你还有什么别的名字吗
Is there another name you prefer?

523
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,740
有什么地方我们可以私下谈谈吗
Is there somewhere we could talk privately?

524
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,540
我其实挺喜欢「拉克」这名字  有种独特的魅力
In fact I like "Lark." It does have a certain ring.

525
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,630
我们没有多少时间
We don't have a lot of time.

526
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,560
因为说实话
'Cause I'll be honest with you.

527
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,400
从你在外的名声来看  我没想到你会这么帅
A man of your reputation, I was expecting someone uglier.

528
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,220
不要被外表所欺  我的真面目也很凶恶丑陋
Don't let looks deceive. I'm as ugly as they come.

529
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,170
我也说句实话  你的生命处于危险之中
And I'll be honest with you. Your life is in danger.

530
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,620
不准碰她
Don't you touch her.

531
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,800
放轻松  这是我哥哥
Relax. It's my brother.

532
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,710
你对我们的客人很粗鲁  佐拉
You're being rude to our guest, Zola.

533
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,080
该走了
It's time to go.

534
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,840
别在这儿闹得很难看
Don't turn this into a scene.

535
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,330
你不会想和这个人待在一起的
You don't want to be with this one.

536
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,680
-你刚说什么来着  -你的生命处于危险之中
- You were saying? - Your life is in danger.

537
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,860
谁会想杀了我
And who would want to kill me?

538
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,590
首先  美国人
The Americans, for starters.

539
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,940
如果真是这样  那我早就知道了
If that were true, I would know it.

540
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,820
你认为你是唯一一个
You think you're the only one

541
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,440
在政府内部有间谍的人吗
with spies in the government?

542
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,980
这里有人不希望我跟你见面
There are people here who don't want this meeting to happen.

543
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,470
不相信我吗
Don't believe me?

544
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,420
看看周围
Look around.

545
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,180
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

546
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,500
也许他们不是来杀你的
Maybe they're not here for you.

547
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,730
也许他们的目标是我
Maybe they're just here for me.

548
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,310
你愿意冒这个险吗
Are you willing to take that chance?

549
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,980
你有我想要的东西
You have something I want.

550
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,740
而这让我成为你唯一可以信任
Right now, that makes me the only person you can trust

551
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,670
让你活着离开这里的人
to get you out of here alive.

552
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,280
还是说你更愿意依靠你哥哥
Or would you rather leave that to your brother?

553
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,250
我想马上回家  拉克先生
I think I'd like to go home now, Mr. Lark.

554
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,070
法国政府今天中午已经收到了「货」
The French government took receipt of the asset at noon today.

555
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,740
并将在明天早上8点
Delivery will be via air to the Finance Ministry

556
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,380
空运至财政部
at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

557
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,210
一支在警方严密护送下的装甲车队
An armored motorcade under heavy police escort

558
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,220
将通过这条路线运送他
will transport him via this route.

559
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:52,110
我们将在这个十字路口制造障碍
We'll create a diversion at this intersection, here.

560
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,590
车队将会自动行驶
The motorcade will automatically take

561
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,590
到这条预选的备用路线
the preplanned alternate route here,

562
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,060
我们到时候半路截取「货物」
where we'll extract the asset.

563
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,420
截取「货物」
Extract the asset?

564
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,810
这就是「货物」
The asset.

565
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,780
我们为了这条消息花了很大一笔钱
We paid a great deal of money for this information.

566
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,210
他们什么都交代清楚了  除了这个人的名字
They gave us everything but this man's name.

567
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,870
你不会碰巧知道他是谁  对吧
You don't happen to know who he is, do you?

568
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,970
他的名字叫所罗门·莱恩
His name is Solomon Lane.

569
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,590
本来是英国特工  叛变成了无政府主义者
British Special Agent turned anarchist.

570
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,910
他利用变节特工
He used rogue covert operatives

571
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,410
创建了一个被称为辛迪加的恐怖网络
to create a terror network called the Syndicate.

572
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:39,500
到处搞破坏  暗杀  大屠杀
Sabotage, assassination, mass murder.

573
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,220
极度凶恶丑陋
As ugly as they come.

574
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,590
两年前他曾被美国特工抓捕
He was captured by American agents two years ago.

575
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,730
从那以后  他一直在被无休止地审讯
Since then, he's been in a never-ending interrogation,

576
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,690
从一个政府转到另一个政府手上
passed around from one government to another

577
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,450
为他的罪行负责
to answer for his crimes.

578
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,660
你看上去不太高兴  拉克
You seem displeased, Lark.

579
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,510
也许我没有表达清楚
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

580
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,160
我来巴黎是为了钚核
I came to Paris for plutonium.

581
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,190
这其中一定有些误会
Well, there must be a misunderstanding.

582
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,460
我只是个中间人
I'm just a broker.

583
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,150
我负责联系买主和卖主
I connect a buyer and a seller.

584
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,350
我的卖家对现金不感兴趣
My seller's not interested in cash,

585
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,170
所以如果你想要钚核
so if you want the plutonium...

586
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,520
就必须截获莱恩
Extract Lane

587
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,860
然后进行交易
and make a trade.

588
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,510
没错
That's right.

589
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,540
我怎么知道卖家有我想要的东西
How do I know the seller has what I want?

590
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,970
这是充满诚意的定金
A down payment in good faith.

591
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,850
信使会在48小时内送来另外两枚
A courier will deliver two more within 48 hours

592
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,540
来交换他
in exchange for him.

593
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:07,980
好吧
All right.

594
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,700
改道后会发生什么
What happens after the diversion?

595
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,830
把所有人都杀了
Kill everyone?

596
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,740
这就是你的计划吗
That's your plan?

597
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,760
不会有目击者
There will be no witnesses.

598
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:53,090
我如何保证莱恩能在行动中活下来
What's my guarantee that lane walks out of this thing alive?

599
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,930
他在一个装甲箱里
He's in an armored box.

600
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,110
等到安全时  我们才会把他放出来
We'll pull him out when it's safe.

601
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,430
你想要拿到钚核
You want your plutonium,

602
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,060
这就是代价
this is the price.

603
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,670
还是说你的底线是不能杀警察
Or do you draw the line at killing cops?

604
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,230
这位可是约翰·拉克啊
That's John Lark you're talking to.

605
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:14,280
我用天花谋杀妇女和儿童
I murder women and children with smallpox.

606
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,280
我没有底线
I have no line.

607
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,670
很好
Right.

608
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,440
大家好好休息吧  明天会很忙
Sleep well, everyone. Busy day tomorrow.

609
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,540
你一定是在跟我开玩笑
You have got to be kidding me.

610
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,570
如果你想让莱恩从监狱里出来  就只能这么做
If you want Lane out of prison, this is how it gets done.

611
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,050
我想让拉克把他救出来  不是伊森·亨特
I wanted Lark to break him out, not Ethan Hunt.

612
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,640
我想要拉克去交易  不是伊森·亨特
I wanted Lark at the exchange, not Ethan Hunt.

613
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,660
我想要拉克引我们找到钚核
I wanted Lark to lead us to the plutonium

614
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,240
和使徒
and the Apostles.

615
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,920
你或许仍然有机会
You may still get your chance.

616
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,900
你忘了我们从巴黎大皇宫
Have you forgotten about the corpse we pulled

617
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,570
男厕所拖出来的那具尸体吗
out of the men's room at the Grand Palais?

618
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,270
我猜那并不是拉克
I'm guessing that wasn't Lark.

619
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:12,760
更有可能是拉克的手下
More likely one of Lark's recruits.

620
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,800
根据我们的情报显示并不是
Not according to our intelligence.

621
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,140
情报是由谁收集的
Intelligence gathered by whom?

622
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,640
亨特
Hunt.

623
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,840
你一直怀疑拉克是一名美国特工
You've long held suspicions that Lark was an American agent.

624
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:26,960
了解我们一举一动的人
Someone who knew our every move.

625
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,900
能像幽灵一样来去无踪的人
Someone who could come and go like a ghost.

626
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,560
你的意思是说亨特就是约翰·拉克
You're suggesting Hunt is John Lark.

627
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,620
你为了自保不惜抓住任何救命稻草  沃克
You're reaching, Walker. Trying to save your ass.

628
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,170
这可行不通
It won't work.

629
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:43,920
你仔细想想  一个像拉克那么小心的人
Think about it. Would a man as careful as Lark

630
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,640
真的会冒这样的风险吗
really stick his neck out like that?

631
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,820
就为了和白寡妇面对面交易
For a face-to-face with the White Widow?

632
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,730
-他会派代理人去  -一个诱饵
- He'd send a proxy. - A decoy.

633
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,440
如果他真的足够聪明
And if he was really smart,

634
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,160
他会让他的女性朋友
he'd have his lady friend

635
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,420
在可靠的证人  也就是我的面前  杀死那个诱饵
kill that decoy in front of a reliable witness. Me.

636
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:02,200
拉网式搜捕即将围剿他的恐怖主义第二人格
The dragnet is closing in on his terrorist alter ego.

637
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,750
所以他花钱请一个人来扮演拉克的角色
So he pays a man to play the part of Lark

638
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,380
然后杀死他
and has him killed.

639
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,630
在为国家服务的幌子下
And under the guise of serving his country...

640
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,270
伪装出他自己的秘密身份
Assumes his own secret identity.

641
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:15,620
在美国政府的全力支持下  可以恣意妄为
Free to operate at will with the full support of the U.S. government.

642
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:16,480
为什么
Why?

643
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:18,920
亨特为什么要背叛
Why would Hunt turn?

644
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,800
莱恩为什么背叛  他的使徒又为什么这么做
Why did Lane do it? Why did any of his Apostles?

645
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,820
他们都曾有着崇高的信仰
They were believers in a cause.

646
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,630
当那个信仰被证实是谎言的时候
And when that cause turned out to be a lie,

647
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,970
他们就背叛了自己的主人
they turned against their masters.

648
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,800
亨特的政府背叛了他多少次
How many times has Hunt's government betrayed him,

649
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,880
否认他的存在  把他丢到一边
disavowed him, cast him aside?

650
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,500
像他这样的人  忍到什么时候就忍无可忍了呢
And how long before a man like that has had enough?

651
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,680
这是一个严重的指控
That is a serious accusation.

652
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,870
你能证实吗
Can you prove it?

653
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,610
这是我们在巴黎大皇宫
This is the phone we pulled off the dead body

654
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,640
从尸体身上找到的手机
at the Grand Palais.

655
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,480
我猜里面会有你需要的所有证据
I'm guessing it has all the proof you need.

656
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:09,510
莱恩真的曾用毒气毒死了一个有两千人的村庄吗
Is it true Lane gassed a village of 2,000 people?

657
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:13,420
是的
Yes.

658
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,000
他真的曾击落一架客机
Is it true he brought down an entire passenger plane

659
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,520
就为了杀死一个人吗
just to kill one man?

660
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,580
是的
Yes.

661
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,260
-他真的...  -沃克
- Is it true that he... - Hey, Walker.

662
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,070
不管你听说了什么  只要让你觉得毛骨悚然
Whatever you heard, if it makes your skin crawl,

663
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,470
那很可能就是真的了
it's probably true.

664
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:34,970
天呐
Holy shit.

665
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,000
你就是抓住他的那个人  对吗
You're the guy that caught him, aren't you?

666
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:43,890
你觉得他能把这件事隐瞒多久
How long do you think he's gonna keep that to himself?

667
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,090
到时候见机行事  阻止他说出来
We'll burn that bridge when we get to it.

668
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,320
他在搞什么鬼
What the hell is he doing?

669
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,860
亨特  你在哪儿
Hunt? Where are you?

670
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,130
别等我了
Don't wait for me!

671
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,340
怎么了  出什么事了
What is it? What's wrong?

672
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:41,170
我们在车库见面
I'll meet you at the garage.

673
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:52,450
班吉  你收到了吗
Benji, do you copy?

674
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,040
我们收到  说
We copy. Go.

675
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,190
改变计划  我暴露了  需要协助脱身
Change of plan. I'm blown. Need extraction.

676
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,430
我们马上赶来
We're on our way.

677
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:17,400
他正从巴黎圣母院前往圣路易斯大桥
各小队正在追捕

678
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:39,830
停下

679
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:41,930
站在原地

680
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:43,960
上车
Get in the car.

681
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:45,920
都不许动

682
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:50,500
举起手来

683
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:54,820
赶快离开  拜托了

684
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,370
所有人  都举起手来

685
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,720
离开这里  拜托了

686
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,440
佐拉想跟你谈谈
Zola wants a word with you.

687
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:21,750
要怎么处理她

688
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,160
了结掉她

689
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:55,210
你不会有事的

690
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,330
我们该走了
We got to go.

691
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,770
我很抱歉

692
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,040
快点
Come on.

693
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,460
顺便说下  我叫沃克
The name's Walker, by the way.

694
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,870
是你选的这么小的车吗
Was the little car your idea?

695
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,120
天呐
Jesus Christ!

696
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:02,980
怎么回事
What the hell was that?

697
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,470
-都下车  -快快快
- Everybody out. - Go, go, go!

698
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:50,170
那是伊尔莎
That was Ilsa.

699
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:51,800
闭嘴
Shut up.

700
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:53,850
真有意思
Very interesting.

701
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,620
很高兴再次见到你  伊森
It's good to see you again, Ethan.

702
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,420
瞧瞧谁还活着呢
Oh, look who's still alive.

703
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:45,380
他的脖子里有个微波追踪器
There's a microwave tracker in his neck.

704
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,790
明白了  你知道该怎么做
Got it. You know what to do.

705
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:50,240
我向你保证  一点都不疼...才怪
Let me just assure you, this won't hurt...enough.

706
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:53,900
我们有90秒的时间
Ninety seconds.

707
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:56,550
你和你的使徒以为
You and your Apostles think

708
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:58,910
我们会用你来换丢失的钚核
we're gonna trade you for the missing plutonium.

709
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,900
我来告诉你那是不可能的
I'm here to tell you that's never gonna happen.

710
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,890
"你的任务  请选择是否接受"
"Your mission, should you choose to accept it."

711
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:07,480
我想知道  伊森
I wonder, Ethan,

712
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,620
你选择过不接受吗
did you ever choose not to?

713
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:12,090
你有停下来问过自己
Did you ever stop and ask yourself

714
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:14,550
给你下命令的人是谁或者背后的原因吗
who it was giving you the orders or why?

715
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,370
每一天  你侍奉的主人
While every day the master you serve

716
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:20,070
距离让世界毁灭都更近了一步
moves one step closer to ending the world.

717
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:22,470
恐怖分子做出这样的指控还真奇怪
Strange accusation coming from a terrorist.

718
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:23,490
60秒
Sixty seconds.

719
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:25,920
恐怖分子就像是渴求被关注的学生
Terrorists are schoolboys desperate for attention,

720
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,860
寄希望于用恐惧来改变公众的观念
hoping to shape public opinion through fear.

721
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,480
我才不关心人们会怎么想或是什么感受
I don't care in the least what people think or feel.

722
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,830
根据我的经验  他们很快就会忘了
In my experience, they don't do either for very long.

723
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:37,810
那就能成为你炸毁工厂
Oh, and I suppose that justifies bombing factories

724
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:39,670
炸掉民用飞机的合理理由吗
or bringing down civilian aircraft.

725
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:42,180
或者给我绑上炸弹背心
Or strapping me into an explosive vest!

726
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:45,320
最后一项还没完成  有趣的小朋友
Consider it unfinished business, my funny little friend.

727
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,310
-路德  -快了
- Luther? - Almost there.

728
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,590
你和我一样看得清结局  伊森
You see the end as clearly as I do, Ethan.

729
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:52,410
全世界的政府都陷入了疯狂
Governments the world over are descending into madness.

730
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:56,600
建立辛迪加的目的就是一点一点地摧毁他们
The Syndicate was created to tear them down, brick by brick.

731
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,680
辛迪加是一群只知道杀人的懦夫
The Syndicate was a pack of murdering cowards.

732
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,890
辛迪加是文明最后的希望
The Syndicate was civilization's last hope!

733
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:05,670
一个粉碎旧的世界秩序的机会
A chance to smash the old world order.

734
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,510
那个希望现在破灭了
That hope is gone now

735
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:11,250
就因为你和你可悲的道德观
because of you and your pathetic morality.

736
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:15,150
你应该杀了我的  伊森
You should have killed me, Ethan.

737
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,670
你一直害怕的结局
The end you've always feared

738
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:21,050
就要来了
is coming.

739
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,080
就要来了
It's coming!

740
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:30,010
你的双手将沾满鲜血
And the blood will be on your hands.

741
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,640
都是你的好意造成的彻底毁灭
The fallout of all your good intentions.

742
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,560
-时间到了  -取出来了
- Time. - Got it.

743
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,610
拉他起来
Get him up.

744
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:15,870
现在你是我的了
You're mine now.

745
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:27,320
你身上真是充满惊喜  拉克
You're just full of surprises, Lark.

746
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,910
你哥哥的计划从一开始就注定失败
Your brother's plan was bad from the word go.

747
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:31,590
你会丧失所有手下
You'd have lost all your men

748
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,320
莱恩还会死在交火中
and Lane would've been killed in the crossfire.

749
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,060
我不得不临时变通
I had to improvise.

750
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:39,110
那你为什么不早说
Well, why not say that in the first place?

751
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,170
因为我不信任你的人
Because I don't trust your people.

752
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:43,440
尤其不信任你哥哥
Especially not your brother.

753
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:50,320
家人  能拿他们怎么办呢
Family. What can you do?

754
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,610
那么  莱恩在哪
So, where's Lane?

755
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,480
显然不在塞纳河底
Certainly not at the bottom of the Seine.

756
01:10:57,610 --> 01:10:59,320
他在我手上  很安全
I have him. He's safe.

757
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,710
我去哪儿见信使
Where do I meet the courier?

758
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,320
我们谈谈那个女人
Let's talk about the woman.

759
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:08,510
哪个女人
Woman?

760
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,960
在巴黎大皇宫时她也和你在一起
She was with you at the Palais.

761
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,640
佐拉今天又看到她了
Zola saw her again today.

762
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:13,160
她试图杀了莱恩
She tried to kill Lane.

763
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,160
她有机会杀你  但她没有下手
She had the chance to kill you, but she didn't.

764
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,270
为什么
Why?

765
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,280
我们有段过往
We have a past.

766
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,170
说起来很复杂
It's complicated.

767
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:29,390
我来帮你把它变得更复杂
Well, I'll make it more complicated for you.

768
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,790
我刚刚涨价了
My price just went up.

769
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,200
今天有人杀了我的四个手下
Someone killed four of my men today.

770
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:35,840
我猜是她
I'm assuming it was her.

771
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,080
我要她  拉克
I want her, Lark.

772
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,860
你要把她交给我
And you're gonna bring her to me.

773
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,630
否则你就见不到信使
Otherwise, you don't meet the courier

774
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:51,800
钚核会卖给出价最高者
and the plutonium goes to the highest bidder.

775
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,720
我不想让她成为我们之间的阻碍
I'd hate for her to come between us.

776
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:01,410
她是你的了
She's yours.

777
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:05,150
会面时交给你  之前不行
At the meeting. Not before.

778
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:18,370
去伦敦
Go to London.

779
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:21,280
随后会有指示
Instructions will follow.

780
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:05,580
我知道只要跟着她  你迟早会出现
I knew if I followed her, you'd show up eventually.

781
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,170
你还好吗
Are you okay?

782
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,150
伊尔莎  我不想伤害你的
Ilsa, I never wanted to hurt you.

783
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:13,110
我知道你有你的理由
I know you have your reasons.

784
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:15,320
我懂
I know.

785
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,730
你得抽身离开
You need to walk away.

786
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,640
我做不到
I can't do that.

787
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:27,690
-你去巴黎大皇宫不是为了杀拉克  -的确不是
- You weren't at the Palais to kill Lark. - No.

788
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:31,090
你是去保护他的
You were there to protect him.

789
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:32,840
是的
Yes.

790
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:35,150
而你为了保护我杀了他
And you killed him to protect me.

791
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,340
你希望拉克救出莱恩
You wanted Lark to break Lane out.

792
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:44,160
不对  你需要他救出莱恩
No, you needed him to break Lane out.

793
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:46,960
因为你必须杀了莱恩
Because you have to kill Lane.

794
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,320
是谁强迫你做这事的
Who's making you do this?

795
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:53,520
军情六处
MI6.

796
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,530
为什么
Why?

797
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,530
我们在伦敦抓到他后
After we captured him in London,

798
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:02,410
他们想通过外交途径将莱恩弄回国
they tried to bring Lane home through diplomatic channels.

799
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:05,300
但太多国家想要分一杯羹
But too many countries want their pound of flesh.

800
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,690
他这样的人  见过太多事
A man like that, what he's seen,

801
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,370
对英国情报局了解太多
what he knows about British Intelligence,

802
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:12,190
他们绝不能让他将信息泄露给外国政府
they can't have him talking to a foreign government ever.

803
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:14,200
我问的不是这个
That's not what I'm asking.

804
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:17,200
他们为什么派你来
Why did they send you?

805
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,830
这是我证明忠心的机会
This is how I prove my loyalty.

806
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,600
只有这样我才能真正回家
This is how I come home.

807
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,840
但你已经脱身了
But you were out.

808
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:25,740
你已经自由了
You were free.

809
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:27,430
我们永远都不会自由
We are never free.

810
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:31,030
我在莱恩身边卧底了两年
I spent two years undercover with Lane.

811
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:33,750
对他们来说  我和他一样是个威胁
To them, I'm as much of a threat as he is.

812
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:38,790
要么我杀了他  要么永远逃亡
I kill him, or I never stop running.

813
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,160
现在告诉我他在哪儿
Now tell me where he is.

814
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,420
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

815
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,660
不管怎样我都会杀了他
I will get to him one way or another.

816
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:55,900
别逼我对付你
Please don't make me go through you.

817
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:53,540
喂
Yes.

818
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:55,150
你到伦敦了吗
Are you here in London?

819
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:56,310
是的
I am.

820
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:58,460
你准备好和信使见面了吗
Are you ready to meet the courier?

821
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,460
准备好了  去哪见面
Yes. Where do I go?

822
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:03,400
你想去哪儿
Where would you like to meet?

823
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:08,680
定位来电

824
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,110
部长先生
Mr. Secretary.

825
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:45,920
我曾向上帝祈祷这不是真的
I prayed to God that it wasn't true.

826
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:47,910
我替他说句话  先生
Well, in his defense, sir,

827
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:49,400
如果伊森没有插手
if Ethan hadn't intervened,

828
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,680
会有更多的人被杀
a great many people would have been killed.

829
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,970
没错  邓恩  我相信巴黎的居民
Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that the good people of Paris

830
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:55,950
和法国全国都会考虑这一点的
and the nation of France as a whole will take that into account.

831
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:58,830
到底发生什么了
So what the hell happened?

832
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:20,580
至此  我们被告知来伦敦
...at which point, we were told to come to London

833
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:23,130
等候进一步指示
and await further instructions.

834
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:24,500
现在怎么办
And what happens now?

835
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,330
现在
Now,

836
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,080
我们20分钟后和白寡妇见面
we meet the Widow in 20 minutes.

837
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:30,570
她会带我们去见信使
She'll take us to a courier

838
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:33,850
信使会用我们丢失的钚核交换所罗门·莱恩
who'll hand over our missing plutonium in exchange for Solomon Lane.

839
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:35,140
或者按我们的方案中
Or, in our scenario,

840
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:37,720
班吉
Benji.

841
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:39,570
天啊
Jesus.

842
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,830
不好意思  什么
I'm sorry, what?

843
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:42,480
路德和我会把你交给信使
Luther and I are gonna take you to the courier.

844
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,150
沃克在这里守着真正的莱恩
Walker stays here and guards the real Lane.

845
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:45,270
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

846
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:47,050
等等  为什么非得由我扮莱恩
Wait, wait. Why do I have to be Lane?

847
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:47,810
班吉
Benji.

848
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:50,720
我们的任务  我的任务  是把钚核拿回来
Our mission, my mission, is to recover that plutonium,

849
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:53,100
我会不惜一切代价
and I will do so at any cost.

850
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,790
哪怕需要用莱恩做交易
Even if I have to trade Lane.

851
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:56,220
真正的莱恩
The real Lane.

852
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:58,300
我绝不会放他走
And I will never let him go.

853
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:01,430
等使徒发现你的小把戏
When the Apostles realize that you're playing games,

854
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:04,020
你就会再次失去钚核
you'll lose the plutonium. Again.

855
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,940
让我们来操心使徒吧
You let us worry about the Apostles.

856
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:08,550
目前我们有更严重的问题
As it stands, we have a bigger problem.

857
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:09,790
更严重的问题
A bigger problem?

858
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,200
-伊尔莎  -伊尔莎
- Ilsa. - Ilsa?

859
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,770
我们的伊尔莎  伊尔莎·浮士德
Our Ilsa? Ilsa Faust Ilsa?

860
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:15,000
她是怎么卷进来的
How is she mixed up in all of this?

861
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,430
她受军情六处的直接命令来杀莱恩
She's been ordered to kill Lane. Direct from MI6.

862
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:21,320
等等  巴黎那个人是她  骑摩托的
Look, wait. So that was her in Paris? On the bike.

863
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:21,900
是的
Yeah.

864
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,270
伊森  她想杀了我们
Ethan, she tried to kill us!

865
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:24,680
-不  不是我们  -是啊
- No, not us. Not us. - Yeah.

866
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,860
莱恩  她想杀的是莱恩  她别无选择
Lane. She tried to kill Lane. She has no choice.

867
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:28,040
所以她会杀了我
And she will kill me!

868
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,000
我不会让那发生的
I'm not gonna let that happen.

869
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:31,590
伊森  你要怎样阻止
Ethan, how exactly are you not gonna let that happen?

870
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,250
-我还在考虑  -他还在考虑
- I'm working on it. - Oh, he's working on it.

871
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,490
现在我们没时间了
Right now, we don't have a lot of time.

872
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:38,280
我们得开始为会面做准备
We have to start getting ready for this meeting.

873
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,660
会面是个陷阱
The meeting is a trap.

874
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:43,110
白寡妇在和中情局合作
The White Widow is working with the CIA.

875
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:44,950
从一开始就是
She has been since the beginning.

876
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,340
为她的军火交易争取豁免权
Bargaining for immunity is her stock-in-trade.

877
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:51,310
一网打尽钚核  使徒和约翰·拉克
Capturing the plutonium, and the Apostles, and John Lark

878
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:53,370
为她在美国人面前挣足了情面
buys her a lot of goodwill with the Americans.

879
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,880
但如果斯隆知道会面是陷阱
But if Sloane knew the meeting was a trap,

880
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,780
她为什么不直接告诉我们
why didn't she just tell us?

881
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:58,890
因为对她来说任何人都可能是约翰·拉克
Because, in her mind, anybody could be John Lark,

882
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:00,210
包括我们中的一员
including one of us.

883
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:04,190
现在她的怀疑得到了证实
And now her suspicions are confirmed.

884
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:07,770
根据这份档案
According to that dossier,

885
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:10,600
一系列的电子证据将亨特
a trail of electronic evidence connects Hunt

886
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,210
和疾控中心的天花盗窃联系到了一起
to the theft of smallpox from the CDC.

887
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:16,150
甚至可以将他和一段长期通信联系在一起
It also links him to a lengthy correspondence

888
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,320
证实是他招募了德布朗克博士
ending with the recruitment of Dr. Delbruuk.

889
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,550
当然了  再加上  亨特几乎是亲自
And, of course, Hunt handed over the plutonium

890
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:22,180
将钚核交到了使徒手上
to the Apostles himself.

891
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,480
这些事实  再结合
Now, those facts, coupled with

892
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,620
过去一系列不服从管控的有罪行为
a long and incriminating history of rogue behavior,

893
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:30,410
确证了中情局的一个猜想
corroborate a CIA narrative

894
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:32,650
就是亨特叛变了
that Hunt has snapped.

895
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,490
他对拉克的追捕不过是
And that his search for Lark is nothing but a cover

896
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:37,110
为了隐瞒拉克其实...
to hide the fact that Lark...

897
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,800
就是我
...is me.

898
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,670
我不得不佩服你  伊森
I've got to hand it to you, Ethan.

899
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:46,340
一般当人们说「你是你自己最大的敌人」时
Normally, when people refer to you as your own worst enemy,

900
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:48,000
只是一种比喻
it's just a figure of speech.

901
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,860
恐怕斯隆也有问题要问她
I'm afraid Sloane's got some questions for her as well.

902
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,600
白寡妇免费供出了她
The Widow offered her up at no extra charge.

903
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,900
斯隆从哪得到这些信息的
And where did Sloane get this information?

904
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,770
她没说
She didn't say.

905
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,240
不过她允许我带你自首
She did, however, grant me the opportunity to bring you in,

906
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,240
前提是我终止这项任务
on the condition that I terminate this mission

907
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:11,690
并亲自交出所罗门·莱恩
and hand over Solomon Lane personally.

908
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:14,210
-长官  你不能这么做  -亨特
- Sir, you can't do that. - Hunt.

909
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:16,980
我了解莱恩  他绝不想回去
I know Lane. And he has no intention of going back.

910
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,350
所以我们要带他回去
That's why we're taking him back.

911
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:21,580
这刚好就是他的目的
Which means that's exactly what he wants us to do.

912
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,660
-伊森  -长官  你觉得
- Ethan... - Sir, what do you

913
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:23,890
这是怎么回事  巧合吗
think this is? A coincidence?

914
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:25,180
有人恰巧发现了这个
That someone just happened upon this?

915
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,730
是莱恩寄给了她  他知道她会做出什么反应
Lane had it sent to her. He knew how she would react.

916
01:21:27,730 --> 01:21:29,870
就像他知道白寡妇会出卖我们
Just like he knew the Widow would turn us in.

917
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:31,000
你还不明白吗
Don't you see?

918
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,290
这个  长官
This, sir...

919
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:34,530
这才是陷阱
This is the trap.

920
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,310
-我们在被他们操控  -亨特
- We are being directed. - Hunt!

921
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:39,410
长官  还有两个钚核下落不明
Sir, there are still two plutonium cores in the wind!

922
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:41,970
那是你弄丢的
And you lost them!

923
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:46,450
长官  公平点说  是我们丢的
In fairness, sir, we all lost them.

924
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:49,510
恕我直言  长官  你当时不在场
Respectfully, sir, you weren't there.

925
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:52,500
所以你们现在的工作就是为他找借口吗
So making excuses for him is your full-time job now?

926
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:56,690
我的天  伊森  别让这更艰难了
Good God, Ethan, don't make this any harder than it already is.

927
01:21:56,690 --> 01:21:59,770
我无法再保护你了  还不明白吗
I can no longer protect you, don't you understand that?

928
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:02,610
你想拿到钚核  只能走到这一步了
This is as close as you're ever gonna get to that plutonium.

929
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:04,430
长官  你其实并不相信这个说法
Sir, you don't actually believe this.

930
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,820
我相信这是个可以保护你或IMF的机会
I believe I've been given a choice to protect you or the IMF,

931
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,390
所以我要把你带回去交给局里
which is why I'm bringing you in.

932
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,130
如果我拒绝呢
And if I refuse?

933
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:14,060
你以为他是来干嘛的
What do you think he's here for?

934
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:15,810
你以为他就是个旁观者
You think he's some observer?

935
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:17,190
他是个杀手
He's an assassin!

936
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:19,960
艾瑞卡·斯隆的头号打手
Erika Sloane's number-one plumber.

937
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:22,390
你要敢逃走  他有权追捕你
You go rogue, he's authorized to hunt you down

938
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:24,570
然后杀了你
and kill you.

939
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:30,740
职责而已  别见怪
It's the job. No hard feelings.

940
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,390
接受事实吧  伊森
Accept it, Ethan.

941
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,520
你这局已经输了  木已成舟  别再倔了
You've lost this one. What's done is done.

942
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,890
不  长官  不是的
No, sir. No.

943
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:42,050
我不是在请求  我是在给你下命令
I am not asking you. I am giving you a direct order.

944
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:44,580
本次任务终止
This mission is terminated.

945
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:46,260
立即生效
Now!

946
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:50,720
斯蒂克尔  他是你的朋友
Stickell, he's your friend.

947
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,570
能拜托你好好劝他...
Would you please talk some sense into...

948
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,470
抱歉  长官  但你让我别无选择
I'm sorry, sir, but you left me no choice.

949
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:01,900
我们还有15分钟就要去见白寡妇
There's 15 minutes before we meet the Widow.

950
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:03,340
你想要钚核  只有我们
You want the plutonium, we're the only ones

951
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:05,670
能帮你拿到  你选择入不入伙吗
who can get it for you. You in or out?

952
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:08,470
入
In.

953
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:11,050
-你在干什么  -班吉得去准备了
- What are you doing? - Benji needs to get ready.

954
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:12,990
-不行  伊森  -没时间了  路德
- No, Ethan... - There's no time, Luther.

955
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,300
我需要你信任我
I need you to trust me.

956
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,800
你还好吗
You all right?

957
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:34,430
还好  就是...
Yeah, I just...

958
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:36,720
有种不祥的预感
got a bad feeling about this one.

959
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:04,390
如果没有我们的消息...
If you don't hear from us...

960
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:06,390
我会按我的方法来
I'll do it my way.

961
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:12,070
把他盯紧了
Don't take your eyes off him.

962
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:50,890
不用继续演了  我带你离开
Enough games. I'm taking you out of here.

963
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:51,970
亨特在哪儿
Where's Hunt?

964
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,940
他带着你的替身去见白寡妇了
He's gone to the meeting, with a copy of you.

965
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:56,060
冷静点
Calm down.

966
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:58,010
呼叫使徒  提醒他们
Call the Apostles. Warn them.

967
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:59,660
我不知道怎么联系他们
I have no way of contacting them.

968
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:01,220
出于我们双方的安全考虑
For their safety and mine.

969
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:03,090
我只有一支撤离小队
What I do have is an extraction team with

970
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:05,600
正在进行卫星监视  并提前定好了集合地点
satellite overwatch and a prearranged rendezvous.

971
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:06,950
我们一离开他们就会知道
They'll know as soon as we leave the building.

972
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:09,500
不  我要留在这里
No, I'm staying here.

973
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,540
我和亨特的事还没了结
I haven't finished with Hunt yet.

974
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:19,580
你为什么要把事情搞得这么复杂
Why did you have to make this so fucking complicated?

975
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:21,470
我不懂你的意思
I don't understand what you mean.

976
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:22,840
当初的交易很简单
The deal was simple.

977
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:26,110
我帮你陷害亨特  你把钚核给我
I help you frame Hunt, you give me the plutonium.

978
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:28,440
你这是在浪费时间
You're wasting time.

979
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:31,520
"所有的和平  都需要伟大的牺牲
"There cannot be peace without first a great suffering.

980
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:34,760
牺牲越大  和平越久"
"The greater the suffering, the greater the peace."

981
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:35,850
我写这些话的时候
When I wrote those words,

982
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:40,060
指的可不是你的和平  或亨特的牺牲
I wasn't referring to your peace or Hunt's suffering.

983
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:42,700
旧世界的秩序需要被废除
The old world order needs dismantling,

984
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,600
而我们有可以实现这一点的工具
and we have the tools to dismantle it.

985
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,260
而你似乎只关心
All you seem to care about

986
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:49,040
让亨特背负罪责活下去
is that Hunt lives to take the blame.

987
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:50,520
你这不是无政府主义
That's not anarchy.

988
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:52,150
而是报复
That's revenge.

989
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:53,800
没错
Yes, it is.

990
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,620
当我如愿以偿时
And when I have what I want,

991
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,270
使徒会把钚核给你
the Apostles will give you the plutonium.

992
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:05,300
亨特是你唯一的朋友
Hunt's the only friend you've got.

993
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:06,040
你能活到今天
You're only alive today

994
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:08,130
是因为他下不了狠心杀你
because he didn't have the guts to kill you.

995
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:11,020
斯隆说得对  IMF就是过家家
Sloane was right. The IMF is Halloween.

996
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,900
不过就是几个成年人戴着...
Nothing but grown men wearing...

997
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:21,660
怎么了
What?

998
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,790
职责而已  别见怪
It's just the job. No hard feelings.

999
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,860
我破坏了你的好日子  是吗
I've ruined your day, haven't I?

1000
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,130
你在此之前都伪装得天衣无缝
And you were doing so well up until then.

1001
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,310
我看这一支才有子弹
Now, I think this one's loaded.

1002
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:47,100
你想试试吗
You want to find out?

1003
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:32,240
-我演得怎么样  -我从未有过半分疑虑
- So, how'd I do? - I never had a doubt.

1004
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:36,780
我开始明白你们为什么喜欢这么玩了
I'm beginning to see why you guys enjoy this so much.

1005
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,370
过奖  部长先生
Hats off, Mr. Secretary.

1006
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:41,470
-那家伙是天生好手  -欢迎加入  长官
- The man's a natural. - Welcome to the team, sir.

1007
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:44,110
你们这是在犯错
You're making a mistake.

1008
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:48,580
不  犯错的是我  我不该在巴黎救你
No, the mistake was mine when I saved your life over Paris.

1009
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:51,240
这证明不了什么  我是在演戏
This proves nothing. I'm playing a role,

1010
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:53,690
就跟你们一样  都是为了拿回钚核
just like you are, trying to recover that plutonium.

1011
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:55,910
这还是无法解释你为什么要给斯隆那份档案
That doesn't explain why you gave Sloane the dossier

1012
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:57,380
试图陷害亨特
and tried to frame Hunt.

1013
01:27:57,470 --> 01:27:58,710
他说得有道理
He makes a good point,

1014
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,700
拉克
Lark.

1015
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:03,200
他有妄想症  精神紊乱
He's paranoid. Delusional.

1016
01:28:03,410 --> 01:28:04,920
正如档案里写的一样
Just like the dossier says.

1017
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,850
那斯隆是从哪拿到了这份档案
So where did Sloane get the dossier from?

1018
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:08,690
我不知道
I have no idea.

1019
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:10,160
我知道
I do.

1020
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:14,560
你都听到了吧  艾瑞卡
Did you get all that, Erika?

1021
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:16,060
是的
I did.

1022
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,230
我不喜欢被利用  沃克
I don't appreciate being used, Walker.

1023
01:28:19,690 --> 01:28:22,330
哎呦  闯祸了
Oops. Bad boy.

1024
01:28:23,610 --> 01:28:25,200
你想要把他送到哪
Where would you like him delivered?

1025
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:26,710
我会去找你
I'll come to you.

1026
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:31,930
都不许动  都不许动
Nobody move! Nobody move!

1027
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:33,490
放下武器  都放下
Weapons down! Drop 'em!

1028
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:36,170
举起手来  放下武器
Hands in the air! Weapons down!

1029
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:38,260
放下  放下
Drop it! Drop it!

1030
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:40,110
放下武器  快点  你
Weapons down! Right now! You!

1031
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:43,320
没事  没事  没事的
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. It's all right.

1032
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:44,930
我们不是说好了吗
I thought we had a deal.

1033
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:47,860
之前是  现在没了
We did. And now we don't.

1034
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:51,270
现在的风险太高  我可不敢冒险
There is too much at stake here for me to take any chances.

1035
01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:54,370
我要把你们和沃克一起带走
I'm bringing you all in, along with Walker.

1036
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:56,030
钚核还流落在外
The plutonium is still out there!

1037
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:58,800
但我却无法放心让你们任何一人去拿回钚核
And I don't trust a living soul in that room to get it.

1038
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,740
我们会在华盛顿弄清楚你们的身份
We'll sort out who's who in Washington.

1039
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,320
-艾瑞卡  -长官
- Erika! - Sir?

1040
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,280
没关系  我们就照她说的做
It's all right. Let's just do what she says.

1041
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:10,820
真正的威胁都在这里  都在我们手里了
The only real threats are in this room, and we have them.

1042
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:14,840
是吗
Do you?

1043
01:29:16,210 --> 01:29:17,210
动手
Go.

1044
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:38,440
莱恩跑哪去了
Where the hell is Lane?

1045
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:10,710
伊森  伊森
Ethan! Ethan!

1046
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:36,630
第一队都倒下了  派后援来
First team is down. Send backup.

1047
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,020
长官
Sir!

1048
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,930
不  不  有人受伤  有人受伤
Oh, no, no, no. Man down! Man down!

1049
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:48,270
谁来帮帮忙
Somebody help!

1050
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:58,360
长官
Sir.

1051
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:05,590
伊森  我给沃克注射了追踪器  但他跑了
Ethan, I tagged Walker, but he's on the run.

1052
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:06,720
你得去抓到他
You got to get him.

1053
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:12,920
去吧
Go.

1054
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:15,940
抱歉  长官
I'm sorry, sir.

1055
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:19,330
去吧
Go.

1056
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:31,150
伊森
Ethan?

1057
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:36,490
等等
Wait!

1058
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:39,800
去抓回那个狗娘养的
Get that son of a bitch.

1059
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:09,820
快啊  快啊  快啊
Come on, come on, come on.

1060
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:12,200
棒  我定位到他了
Yes! I got him.

1061
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:24,130
不好意思
I'm sorry.

1062
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:27,150
告诉我  班吉  沃克在哪
Talk to me, Benji. Where's Walker?

1063
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:29,450
你向右转  他在你西方约400米处
He's about a quarter mile west if you turn right.

1064
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:30,760
向右转吗
To my right?

1065
01:32:33,870 --> 01:32:35,060
我没办法过去
I can't do that.

1066
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:36,680
为什么不行
Why not?

1067
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:39,100
因为我被盯上了
Because I'm being followed.

1068
01:32:39,210 --> 01:32:40,900
什么意思  被谁
What do you mean? By who?

1069
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:43,290
我怎么知道  中情局或是使徒
How do I know? CIA, Apostles...

1070
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:44,500
有什么区别吗
What difference does it make?

1071
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:47,860
好吧  好吧  那就赶紧离开  然后右转
Okay, okay, just get out of there and then go right.

1072
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,080
我非常抱歉
I am terribly sorry.

1073
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,580
请原谅我
Excuse me.

1074
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:17,350
他为什么在绕圈
Why is he running in circles?

1075
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,210
好了  你需要尽快穿过左边的街道
Okay, you need to cross the street on your left as soon as you can.

1076
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:53,990
伊森  你收到了吗
Ethan, did you copy?

1077
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:56,430
-左边  快左转  -我在努力了
- Left, go left, now! - I'm working on it.

1078
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,940
现在穿过你前方的街道
Now go across the street right in front of you.

1079
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:20,250
伊森  他正在远离你  你得快一点
Ethan, he's getting away from you! You're gonna have to go faster.

1080
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:53,700
你要追上他了  直走
You're gaining on him! Go straight.

1081
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:57,970
直走  一直走吗
Straight? Keep going straight?

1082
01:34:57,970 --> 01:34:59,830
直走  直走  直走
Go straight, go straight, straight, straight.

1083
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:02,750
好  现在右转
Okay, now turn right.

1084
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:03,870
右
Right?

1085
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:05,770
现在吗
Now?

1086
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:07,730
-是  右转  -你确定吗
- Yes, right! - Are you sure?

1087
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:08,630
确定  我
Yes, I'm...

1088
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:11,150
不  是左边  左转
No, it's left! Turn left!

1089
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:12,670
抱歉  刚才屏幕旋转被锁定了
Sorry, I had the screen-lock on.

1090
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:17,760
左
Left.

1091
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:22,390
谢谢
Thank you.

1092
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:32,590
-你还在等什么  -我可是要跳窗
- What are you waiting for? - I'm jumping out a window!

1093
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:34,150
你说什么呢  你要跳...
What do you mean, you're jumping out of a...

1094
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:38,450
抱歉  刚才是平面图
Sorry. I had it in 2D.

1095
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:39,580
祝你好运
Good luck.

1096
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:16,490
到桥的尽头左转  你快追上他了
At the end of the bridge, turn left. You've almost got him.

1097
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:22,180
加油  加油  加油  伊森  抓到他
Come on, come on, come on. Come on, Ethan, get him!

1098
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:23,540
你就在他上方不远处
You're right on top of him!

1099
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:39,910
好了  他就在你前方
That's it, he's right in front of you!

1100
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:41,350
抓住他  抓住他  抓住他
Get him! Get him! Get him!

1101
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:21,180
你不能开枪  对吧  你还没拿到钚核
You can't do it, can you? Not until you get your plutonium.

1102
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:24,970
是啊  他对你还有其他安排
No. He still has plans for you.

1103
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:29,200
你要去自首  承认你就是约翰·拉克
You're gonna turn yourself in and admit you're John Lark,

1104
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:32,230
然后在你的小牢房里看着旧世界被毁灭
then watch the old world implode from your dark little cell.

1105
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:33,810
如果我不去呢
And if I don't?

1106
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,910
我是她的守护天使  亨特
I'm her guardian angel, Hunt.

1107
01:37:50,230 --> 01:37:52,920
再让我看到你  她就会死
If I see you again, she dies.

1108
01:37:53,190 --> 01:37:55,710
如果你试图提醒她  她也会死
If you try to warn her, she dies.

1109
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:57,630
该认输的时候就认输
Know when you're beat.

1110
01:39:09,010 --> 01:39:10,560
这些是我们从德布朗克博士
These are the designs we recovered

1111
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,970
在柏林的实验室里找到的
from Dr. Delbruuk's lab in Berlin.

1112
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:15,190
那是个5兆吨的核装置
That's a five-megaton nuclear device.

1113
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:18,020
比二战中释放的总爆炸能量都要高
That's greater than all the explosive energy released in World War II.

1114
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:21,590
要拆除的话  通常得剪断这根引信
To disarm it, normally we'd cut the fuse wire here.

1115
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:23,400
"通常"是什么意思
What, "normally"?

1116
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,510
沃克和莱恩有两个钚核
Walker and Lane have two plutonium cores,

1117
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:27,950
也就是两个核弹
meaning two bombs.

1118
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:30,080
没错  它们都连接着微波故障保护
Yeah. And they're both linked by a microwave fail-safe

1119
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,240
精确度在0.1秒内
which is accurate to within one-tenth of a second.

1120
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:36,310
若试图拆除一枚核弹  会自动引爆另一枚
Any attempt to defuse one bomb automatically triggers the other.

1121
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:39,830
意味着核弹一经安装  无法拆除
Meaning once armed, the bombs cannot be disarmed.

1122
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,380
倒计时由一个远程引爆器开启
The countdown is started by a remote detonator,

1123
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:44,240
它也有故障保护
which is also a fail-safe.

1124
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:46,490
意味着一旦开始倒计时
Meaning once the countdown starts,

1125
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:48,620
就无法停止
it can't be stopped.

1126
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:52,660
所以解决办法是....
So the solution to this is?

1127
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:56,040
我们还在研究
We're working on it.

1128
01:39:58,020 --> 01:39:58,920
所以
So,

1129
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:02,500
严格来讲  这就是一次自杀式任务
technically, this is a suicide mission.

1130
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:14,390
怎么了
What is it?

1131
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:17,020
坐吧  请
Have a seat. Please.

1132
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,420
我认识了伊森那么多年
In all the years that I've known Ethan,

1133
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:26,070
只见过他对两个女人动真情
he's only been serious about two women.

1134
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:28,700
一个是他的妻子
One was his wife.

1135
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,050
他结婚了
He's married?

1136
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:32,990
不  是曾经结过
No, he was.

1137
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:35,120
曾经  她出了什么事
Was? What happened to her?

1138
01:40:35,470 --> 01:40:40,150
一群坏人把她抓走了  以此要挟伊森
Well, she was taken by some people who wanted to get to Ethan.

1139
01:40:40,150 --> 01:40:42,840
没事  他把她安然无恙地救回来了
It's okay, he got her back in one piece.

1140
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:44,960
然后他就金盆洗手了
Then he quit the game.

1141
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:48,010
他们度过了一段幸福的时光
They were happy for a while.

1142
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:51,740
但每次世界上有不幸的事发生
But every time something bad happened in the world,

1143
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:54,220
伊森都会认为  "我该去帮忙的"
Ethan would think, "I should've been there."

1144
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:57,160
她也会自问  "伊森在保护我
And she would wonder, "Who's watching the world

1145
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:59,140
那谁来保护世界"
while Ethan's watching me?"

1146
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:02,790
他们内心深处都知道  迟早有一天
Deep down, they both knew that someday, somehow,

1147
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:05,650
会有不可挽回的惨剧发生
something truly terrible was going to happen

1148
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:09,320
就因为他们在一起
all because they were together.

1149
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:11,620
所以...
So...

1150
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:17,020
-她现在在哪儿  -她行踪成谜
- Where is she now? - She's a ghost.

1151
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:18,210
她很擅长隐藏
Good at it, too.

1152
01:41:18,930 --> 01:41:20,420
是我亲自教她的
Taught her myself.

1153
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:22,980
她偶尔会发送信号
Every now and then, she sends up a signal

1154
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:25,300
让伊森知道她平安无事
to let Ethan know she's safe.

1155
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:26,920
那让他安心地继续战斗
And that keeps him going.

1156
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,090
你为什么告诉我这个
Why are you telling me this?

1157
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:34,780
我们身陷现在的困境
We're in this mess

1158
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:37,140
都是因为伊森不愿看着我死
because Ethan wouldn't let me die.

1159
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:41,310
他...他是个好人
He...He's a good man.

1160
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:45,770
他或许嘴上不说  但他实际上非常在乎你
And he cares about you more than he can admit.

1161
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,490
他现在无暇分神去为你操心
That's one more worry than he can handle right now.

1162
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:54,950
如果你也在乎他
If you care about him,

1163
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,330
你就该离开
you should walk away.

1164
01:42:00,730 --> 01:42:01,870
路德
Luther...

1165
01:42:02,270 --> 01:42:03,380
没出什么事吧
Is everything all right?

1166
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,180
我跟你一起去
I'm coming with you.

1167
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:27,690
我懂
I know.

1168
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:33,160
我们如何找到他
So how do we find him?

1169
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:36,680
微波收发器
Microwave transponder.

1170
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:39,540
能通过卫星追踪到世界上任何一个角落
Traceable via satellite anywhere in the world.

1171
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,210
莱恩后颈上就有一个
Lane had one of these in the back of his neck.

1172
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:44,140
我们在巴黎时给取出来了
We removed it in Paris.

1173
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:46,400
同时  把我们的收发器装了进去
At the same time, we put our own transponder in.

1174
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,250
搞定
Got it.

1175
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,780
36小时后才激活
36-hour delayed activation,

1176
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:54,220
以防莱恩的使徒扫描他
in case Lane's Apostles scan him.

1177
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:57,160
所以你们是故意放他走的
So you planned on letting him go.

1178
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:59,010
不是以这种方式  不过是的
Not this way, but yes.

1179
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,450
他会领着我们找到钚核
He's gonna lead us to the plutonium.

1180
01:43:01,450 --> 01:43:02,890
你如何能确定
How can you be sure?

1181
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,850
他陷害我坐牢的计划失败了
His plan to put me in prison went to hell.

1182
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,610
现在他会想让我亲眼看到结局
Now he's gonna want me there for the end.

1183
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:10,460
那收发器什么时候激活
So when does this transponder activate?

1184
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,170
找到他了  找到他了  找到他了
I got him. I got him, I got him, I got him!

1185
01:43:12,170 --> 01:43:14,430
他正在欧洲以五百节速度向东移动
He's traveling east over Europe at 500 knots.

1186
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:15,610
他在飞机上
He's airborne.

1187
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,410
我们要通知中情局吗
Shall we inform the CIA?

1188
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:19,010
中情局已经被渗透了
The CIA's been infiltrated.

1189
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:21,120
除了这房间里的人  我不信任任何人
I don't trust anybody outside of this room.

1190
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:23,410
我们必须独立行动
We're gonna have to go it alone.

1191
01:43:26,690 --> 01:43:27,920
我们该去哪儿
So where do we go?

1192
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:39,910
克什米尔

1193
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:49,270
情况如何  班吉
How we doing, Benji?

1194
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:52,360
如果有拆除这些炸弹的方法  我找不到
If there's a way to defuse these bombs, I can't find it.

1195
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,650
你会想到办法的  我相信你
You'll figure it out. I know you will.

1196
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:58,510
无信号

1197
01:43:56,380 --> 01:43:58,780
该死  伊森  我们失去信号了
Damn. Ethan, we lost the signal.

1198
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:01,180
莱恩一定是发现了我们的信号发射器
Lane must've found our transmitter.

1199
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:02,350
他最后的已知位置在哪儿
What's his last position?

1200
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:04,680
离这里东北方向30英里
At about 30 miles northeast.

1201
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:06,420
那里就是他要我们去的目的地
Then that's where he wants us to go.

1202
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:08,810
-那里有什么  -努布拉河谷
- What's there? - The Nubra River Valley.

1203
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:10,560
那个范围内只有一个医疗营地
There's only a medical camp there.

1204
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:13,000
海外人道主义援助
Humanitarian Aid Overseas.

1205
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:16,010
莱恩为什么要袭击一个医疗营地
Why would Lane target a medical camp?

1206
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:18,140
天花
Smallpox.

1207
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:20,740
-什么  -天花
- What? - Smallpox.

1208
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:23,280
他的使徒曾在克什米尔引起天花爆发
The Apostles triggered a smallpox outbreak in Kashmir.

1209
01:44:23,290 --> 01:44:26,200
莱恩把营地安排到那里一定是有原因的
Lane must've wanted that camp there for a reason.

1210
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:27,100
但具体是什么
But what?

1211
01:44:28,170 --> 01:44:29,900
-天啊  -怎么了
- Oh, my God. - What is it?

1212
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,340
努布拉河就在锡亚琴冰川的山脚下
The Nubra River is at the base of the Siachen Glacier.

1213
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:35,880
一次核爆炸会使
So a nuclear blast there would irradiate

1214
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:39,160
全球最大的自然灌溉系统遭受辐射
the largest natural irrigation system in the world.

1215
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:44,080
从中国边境流入印度和巴基斯坦的淡水都会被污染
Fresh water from the border of China to India and Pakistan.

1216
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:47,560
他们要饿死全球三分一的人口
They're gonna starve one-third of the world's population.

1217
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:49,040
"牺牲越大"
"The greater the suffering..."

1218
01:44:49,230 --> 01:44:51,000
"和平越久"
"...the greater the peace."

1219
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:52,690
我还是不明白
I still don't understand

1220
01:44:52,690 --> 01:44:54,650
莱恩为什么要把一个医疗营地弄到那儿
why Lane wants a medical camp there.

1221
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:55,900
那不重要
It doesn't matter.

1222
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:58,900
现在当务之急是找到拆除炸弹的方法
All that matters now is we find a way to defuse those bombs.

1223
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:00,180
我想我找到了
I think I've found it.

1224
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:01,890
或许吧
Maybe.

1225
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:04,950
你看  炸弹的操作系统似乎有漏洞
Look, there appears to be a flaw in the bomb's operating system.

1226
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:07,410
远程引爆器需要那个引爆键
The remote detonator requires that firing key.

1227
01:45:07,410 --> 01:45:10,370
拆除那个键  应该能让保险装置短路
If we remove that key, then it should short out the fail-safe

1228
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:12,330
然后我们就可以剪断引信
and allow us to cut both fuses.

1229
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:14,340
这么说我们中得有人拿到引爆器
So one of us needs to get the detonator

1230
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:15,750
-拆除引爆键  -没错
- and remove that key. - Yeah.

1231
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:18,720
同时其他人去把两个炸弹的引信剪断
While the rest of us cut the fuses on both bombs.

1232
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:19,610
很简单
Simple.

1233
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,110
没错  但是...
Yeah, but...

1234
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:22,570
但是什么
But what?

1235
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,220
这办法要想奏效
Well, in order to make this work,

1236
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:27,560
必须等到爆炸倒计时开始后
we can't remove the key or cut the fuses

1237
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:30,250
再拆除引爆键  剪断引信
until after the countdown starts.

1238
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:32,630
等等  我理清楚一下
But wait, just so I've got this clear.

1239
01:45:32,730 --> 01:45:35,310
我们安全拆除炸弹的唯一方法
Our only chance to safely defuse both bombs

1240
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,760
是让爆炸倒计时开始
is to let the countdown start.

1241
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:40,510
然后再拆除引爆键
And then remove that key.

1242
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,140
好吧
Okay.

1243
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:11,410
两个爆炸装置都已跟引爆器接通
Both devices are now connected to the detonator.

1244
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,520
15分钟应该足以让你转移到
Fifteen minutes should give you enough time

1245
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:17,090
最小安全距离
to reach minimum safe distance.

1246
01:46:19,230 --> 01:46:21,260
我逃亡的日子结束了
My running days are over.

1247
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,180
这里就是我的终点
This is where it ends for me.

1248
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:55,040
这里到处都是信号
I'm getting signals all over the place.

1249
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:56,560
我们在医疗营地里
We're at a medical camp.

1250
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,730
到处都是X光机  造影扫描仪
X-ray machines, CAT scanners,

1251
01:46:58,730 --> 01:47:00,650
和放射性设备
radiological signatures everywhere.

1252
01:47:00,650 --> 01:47:01,780
这样仿佛大海捞针
It's like a needle in a haystack.

1253
01:47:01,780 --> 01:47:03,860
用排除法  一个一个找
Process of elimination, one at a time.

1254
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:05,760
我们分头行事  保持联络
Let's split up. Stay on comms.

1255
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:17,310
伊森
Ethan?

1256
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:24,240
茱莉亚
Julia?

1257
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:30,200
那是...
Is that...

1258
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:35,620
茱莉亚
Julia!

1259
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:38,750
他知道吗
Does he know?

1260
01:47:42,030 --> 01:47:43,800
这位是我丈夫  艾瑞克
This is my husband, Erik.

1261
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:45,070
这位是...
This is...

1262
01:47:45,070 --> 01:47:47,780
罗伯·索恩  罗伯·索恩医生
Rob. Rob Thorne. Dr. Rob Thorne.

1263
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:50,430
-我曾与茱莉亚...  -在麻省总医院共事
- I worked with Julia... - At Mass General.

1264
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:51,620
在去纽约之前
Before New York.

1265
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:52,680
真不敢相信
You're kidding.

1266
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:54,950
-好巧啊  -就是啊
- What a coincidence! - I know. I...

1267
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,910
-你怎么会跑到这么偏僻的地方来  -我...
- What brings you all this way? - I was, uh...

1268
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:58,860
我之前在附近的塔图克村
I was in Turtuk, not far from here

1269
01:47:59,130 --> 01:48:02,030
听说这里需要人手
and heard help was needed.

1270
01:48:03,090 --> 01:48:04,960
实际上  我们在这里的工作快完成了
Actually, we're just about finished here.

1271
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:07,450
整个村庄都接种疫苗了  不过...
The whole village is inoculated. But, um...

1272
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:10,200
你到塔图克做什么
What were you doing out in Turtuk?

1273
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:11,950
罗伯在度假
Rob's on vacation.

1274
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:15,790
不  不  我是为工作而来
No. No, I'm... I'm working.

1275
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:18,710
你们离家很远啊
You're a long way from home.

1276
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,880
是啊  多亏了我们的守护天使
Yeah, yeah. Thanks to our guardian angel.

1277
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,250
守护天使
Guardian?

1278
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:25,070
是啊  这里疫情爆发时  我们正在
Well, yeah. We were running a field hospital

1279
01:48:25,070 --> 01:48:27,610
苏丹达尔富尔边界运营战地医院
outside of Darfur when the outbreak happened here.

1280
01:48:27,610 --> 01:48:28,320
我们突然接到
And here comes this phone call

1281
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,760
一位匿名捐赠人的电话
from an anonymous donor, out of the blue.

1282
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:33,660
他说他要支付整个行动的费用
And he says he's ready to underwrite the entire operation.

1283
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:34,770
只有一个条件
One condition.

1284
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:37,190
就是由我们来管理
We run the whole thing.

1285
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:38,980
你敢相信吗
Can you believe that?

1286
01:48:40,290 --> 01:48:41,400
我可以相信
I certainly can.

1287
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:43,920
是啊  毫无预兆
Yeah. Out of the blue.

1288
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:44,980
毫无预兆
Out of the blue.

1289
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:49,070
这样的生活很充实丰富
That's quite a full life.

1290
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:51,640
是啊  认识茱莉亚之前  我从不出远门
Yeah, you know, before Julia, I never traveled.

1291
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:53,240
我连纽约都没离开过
I never even left New York.

1292
01:48:53,390 --> 01:48:54,790
整天待在医院里
Never left the hospital.

1293
01:48:54,810 --> 01:48:57,810
一周工作七天  没日没夜  从不休假
Seven days a week, dusk till dawn. No vacations.

1294
01:48:57,810 --> 01:48:59,810
伊森  我好像有所发现
Ethan, I think I found something.

1295
01:48:59,810 --> 01:49:01,600
照那个速度  我50岁就能当上外科主任
I was on the fast track to be Chief of Surgery at 50.

1296
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:02,900
55岁就会心脏病发
Heart attack at 55.

1297
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:06,050
但是她说服我放下那一切
And she convinced me to let it all go.

1298
01:49:06,530 --> 01:49:08,260
到最需要帮助的地方
Help where it's needed most.

1299
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:10,390
从那以后我们一直在外奔波
So we've been on the go ever since,

1300
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:12,350
我的人生从未像现在这般充实满足
and I've never been more fulfilled.

1301
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:15,060
我替你们高兴
I'm happy for you.

1302
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:17,350
谢谢
Thank you.

1303
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:21,620
我们该走了
Well, we should get going.

1304
01:49:21,630 --> 01:49:22,630
有很多东西要收拾打包
We have a lot of packing to do.

1305
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:24,880
不  我去弄就好  你们叙叙旧
Oh, no, I'll handle that. You two should catch up.

1306
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,710
不  我就不打扰你们了
Oh, no, I should get out of your hair.

1307
01:49:26,710 --> 01:49:28,970
开什么玩笑  你应该逗留一阵
Are you kidding? You should stick around.

1308
01:49:28,970 --> 01:49:31,240
我只是很遗憾你白跑了一趟
I'm just sorry you came all this way for nothing.

1309
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:36,010
不如这样吧  我们收拾好行李
Tell you what, we'll pack,

1310
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:37,970
然后开车送你回图塔克
and why don't we give you a ride back to Turtuk,

1311
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:40,460
你们可以在车上叙叙旧  怎么样
you two can catch up in the car? Yeah?

1312
01:49:41,230 --> 01:49:42,330
你太客气了
You're very kind.

1313
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,670
就这么定了  待会儿见
Settled. See you soon.

1314
01:49:47,690 --> 01:49:48,880
见到你很高兴
It was good to see you.

1315
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:53,470
对不起  茱莉亚  对不起
I am so sorry, Julia. I'm so sorry.

1316
01:50:14,470 --> 01:50:16,200
两架直升机都开走
Take both helicopters.

1317
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:18,830
断掉其他所有人离开的路
No one else leaves.

1318
01:50:27,150 --> 01:50:28,760
小心点  小心点
Careful, careful, careful.

1319
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:34,610
炸弹已装上
It's armed.

1320
01:50:34,610 --> 01:50:36,200
但倒计时还未开始
But the countdown hasn't started yet.

1321
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:38,080
网络信号很强  说明另一个爆炸装置
The network signal's strong, which means the other device

1322
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,740
和引爆器也在附近
is close by and the detonator.

1323
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:41,940
大概在那个方向  离这里半公里处
About half a K in that direction.

1324
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:44,520
他们还在这儿
They're still here.

1325
01:50:46,290 --> 01:50:47,250
路德  你继续处理爆炸装置
Luther, you keep working on it.

1326
01:50:47,250 --> 01:50:48,610
你们两个跟我来
You two, come with me.

1327
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:52,450
没问题  我能行
Sure. I got this.

1328
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:54,860
不用担心老路德
Don't worry about old Luther.

1329
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:20,540
正在扫描...

1330
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:29,980
是沃克
Walker.

1331
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:31,920
已连接上

1332
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:37,130
该死
Damn.

1333
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:38,390
伊森  倒计时开始了
Ethan, the countdown has started!

1334
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:39,850
我们只有15分钟的时间
We have 15 minutes.

1335
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:41,370
引爆器在沃克手上
Walker has the detonator.

1336
01:51:52,030 --> 01:51:52,920
快点  快点
Come on, come on!

1337
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:56,530
我们得疏散这些人
We have to evacuate these people.

1338
01:51:56,530 --> 01:51:57,320
没时间了
There's no time.

1339
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:00,100
15分钟后  整个河谷都会被烧成灰烬
This whole valley's gonna be incinerated in 15 minutes.

1340
01:52:03,830 --> 01:52:04,930
已经太迟了
It's too late!

1341
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:05,890
不
No.

1342
01:52:06,580 --> 01:52:08,040
我会拿到引爆器
I'm gonna get the detonator.

1343
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,020
-什么  怎么做  -我会想到办法的
- What? How? - I'll figure it out.

1344
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:12,860
找到莱恩和另一枚炸弹
Find Lane! Find the other bomb!

1345
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:16,740
-他到底在干什么  -我觉得最好别看
- What the hell is he doing? - I find it best not to look.

1346
01:52:52,210 --> 01:52:53,380
路德  情况如何
How we doing, Luther?

1347
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:55,500
到处都是绊线  我只有两只手
Tripwires everywhere. I don't have enough hands.

1348
01:52:55,510 --> 01:52:56,550
想办法解决
Just make it happen.

1349
01:52:56,550 --> 01:52:57,470
伊森在哪儿
Where's Ethan?

1350
01:52:57,470 --> 01:52:59,050
他去追引爆器了
He's gone after the detonator.

1351
01:52:59,050 --> 01:53:00,700
等等  引爆器在哪儿
Wait, where's the detonator?

1352
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:39,610
路德
Luther.

1353
01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:42,640
茱莉亚  你不该来的
Julia. You shouldn't be here.

1354
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:43,620
我的天
Oh, my God.

1355
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:46,060
我的天
Oh, my God.

1356
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:47,260
那是我认为的那东西吗
Is that what I think it is?

1357
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:48,870
路德  把她弄走
Luther, get her out of there!

1358
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:50,540
她能去哪里
Where is she gonna go?

1359
01:53:52,650 --> 01:53:53,670
我能做些什么
What can I do?

1360
01:53:56,110 --> 01:53:58,110
工具箱里有个红色手柄的钳子
In the kit, the pliers with the red grip.

1361
01:53:58,110 --> 01:54:00,990
-你疯了吗  -管好你自己的事  班吉
- Are you insane? - Mind your business, Benji.

1362
01:54:00,990 --> 01:54:02,550
这就是我自己的事
This is my business!

1363
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,840
班吉  能听见吗
Benji, do you copy?

1364
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:49,050
伊森  伊森  你在哪
Ethan! Ethan, where are you?

1365
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:50,780
我在直升机上追沃克
I'm in a helicopter going after Walker.

1366
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:51,870
等一下
Hold on.

1367
01:55:51,870 --> 01:55:53,180
你怎么进到直升机里的
How did you get in the helicopter?

1368
01:55:53,190 --> 01:55:54,600
你会开直升飞机吗
What, you can fly a helicopter?

1369
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:55,840
你刚才是说直升机吗
Did you say helicopter?

1370
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:58,200
你跑到直升机里搞什么
What the hell are you doing in a helicopter?

Just... Hey, hey... Did you find the other bomb?

1372
01:56:01,150 --> 01:56:02,890
我们还在找  不过即使找到了
We're still looking, but finding the bomb

1373
01:56:02,890 --> 01:56:04,760
也没什么用  除非拿到引爆装置
is not gonna matter unless we have the detonator.

1374
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:07,120
我知道  我知道  我保证拿到它
I know. I know. I'll get it. I'll get it!

1375
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:09,590
不过  他人在另一架直升机里
Uh, if he's in another helicopter,

1376
01:56:09,870 --> 01:56:12,220
-你要怎么拿到  -我会想到办法的
- how are you gonna get it? - I'll figure it out.

1377
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:13,970
你们找到炸弹  我来搞定引爆装置
You find the bomb, I'll get the detonator.

1378

1383
01:56:26,590 --> 01:56:27,970
有人能听见吗
Anybody?

1384
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,290
我能做到  我能做到
I can do this. I can do this.

1385
01:56:31,290 --> 01:56:32,160
这都是些什么
What do we got here?

1386
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:34,080
这里有空速表
We've got airspeed.

1387
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:35,890
空速表
Airspeed.

1388
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:38,670
好的  动力  这是动力装置

Power.

1391
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:13,170
把剥皮钳拿来

我是医生  不是电工

1393
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:17,030
抱歉  拿一下绿手柄的那个

1399
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,260
只是确认下
Just checking.

1400
01:57:27,260 --> 01:57:29,230
我喜欢她
Oh, I like her.

1401
01:57:42,250 --> 01:57:43,830
一定要砸中啊
Hold this for me, will you?

1402
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:47,500
我操
Holy shit!

1403
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:53,600
该死的
Damn it!

1404
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:55,880
飞到上面去
Get up there!

1405
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:07,340
没错就是我  混蛋
That's right, prick.

1406
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:17,460
我操
Oh, shit!

1407
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:25,360
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

1408
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:29,420
好吧
All right.

1409
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:39,650
太过了  太猛了
Whoa, whoa, too much. Too much.

1410
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:41,600
我操
Oh, shit!

1411
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,640
拉升  拉升
Pull up. Pull up.

1412
01:58:44,870 --> 01:58:48,410
接近地面  请拉升

1414
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:50,490
我在努力  在努力提升了
I'm trying, I'm trying!

1415
01:58:50,490 --> 01:58:52,940
接近地面  接近地面
Terrain. Terrain.

1416
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:11,560
班吉  我什么都找不到
Benji, I'm not finding anything.

1417
01:59:11,570 --> 01:59:13,560
我觉得我们找错地方了
I think we're looking in the wrong place.

1418
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:15,060
到处都是信号
Signatures everywhere.

1419
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:16,470
这真是藏炸弹的完美地点
This is the perfect place to hide it.

1420
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:18,000
就是为了这样  我了解莱恩
That's the point. I know Lane.

1421
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,660
如果我们在这里一直找
If we're looking here,

1422
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:22,460
那就正中他的下怀
it's because he wants us to.

1423
01:59:25,130 --> 01:59:26,700
我去村子里找
I'm heading to the village.

1424
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:28,280
等等我  好吗
Just wait for me, all right?

1425
01:59:31,950 --> 01:59:33,890
伊尔莎  我感觉我找到什么了
Ilsa, I think I've found something.

1426
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:39,910
从这里把线剪断
Cut this wire right here.

1427
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:44,930
逆时针拧开螺丝  慢慢地
Turn that screw counterclockwise, very slowly.

1428
01:59:44,930 --> 01:59:46,350
明白
Got it.

1429
01:59:48,170 --> 01:59:49,480
所以
So...

1430
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:52,490
他怎么样
How is he?

1431
01:59:52,490 --> 01:59:55,730
你懂的  还是老样子
Oh, you know. Same old Ethan.

1432
02:00:04,890 --> 02:00:06,280
老天
Jesus!

1433
02:00:09,710 --> 02:00:11,080
糟了
Oh, shit!

1434
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:13,310
不不不  不要啊
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1435
02:00:21,110 --> 02:00:22,400
班吉  我看到莱恩了
Benji, I see Lane.

1436
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:23,940
什么  哪里
What? Where?

1437
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:25,340
他在村子边缘的一栋房子里
He's in a house at the edge of the village.

1438
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:27,160
好吧  等着我  行吗
All right, just wait for me, okay?

1439
02:00:27,810 --> 02:00:29,400
伊尔莎  等等我
Ilsa, wait for me!

1440
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:40,470
不行
No.

1441
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:47,020
是核弹可怎么办
Nuclear bomb.

1442
02:00:56,690 --> 02:00:58,180
小心X射线辐射

1443
02:00:57,730 --> 02:00:59,080
该死
Damn it!

1444
02:01:42,030 --> 02:01:43,860
班吉  我找到另一枚炸弹了
Benji, I found the other bomb.

1445
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:45,870
伊尔莎  你在哪里
Ilsa, where are you?

1446
02:01:45,870 --> 02:01:47,210
我在一间房子里
I'm in a house...

1447
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:12,200
喂  你在干什么呢
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1448
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,750
你疯了吧
You're out of your mind!

1449
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:15,830
我都不知道下面有什么
I don't know what's down there.

1450
02:02:19,810 --> 02:02:21,640
拉升  快拉升
Pull up, pull up!

1451
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:33,760
这个狗娘养的疯子打算撞死我们
This crazy son of a bitch is trying to ram us!

1452
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:35,190
开快点
Go!

1453
02:02:52,210 --> 02:02:53,470
操
Shit!

1454
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,100
呼叫班吉
Benji, come in.

1455
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:56,370
我们就快拆到引信了
We're almost at the fuse.

1456
02:02:56,370 --> 02:02:58,540
得赶紧找到另一枚炸弹
We need to find that other bomb now.

1457
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:01,590
你刚刚是说另一枚炸弹吗
Did you just say "other bomb"?

1458
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:04,330
-班吉  听见了吗  -我正在找
- Benji, do you read me? - I'm working on it!

1459
02:03:04,590 --> 02:03:06,400
伊尔莎  你在哪里
Ilsa, where are you?

1460
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:26,310
你阻止不了的
You can't stop it.

1461
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:29,740
明白吗  他什么也做不了
Do you understand? There's nothing he can do.

1462
02:03:29,890 --> 02:03:31,000
等时间一到
When the clock runs out,

1463
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,320
伊森·亨特就会失去一切东西
Ethan Hunt will lose everything

1464
02:03:34,310 --> 02:03:38,580
以及他在乎的每一个人
and everyone he ever cared about.

1465
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,530
伊尔莎
Ilsa!

1466
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:43,790
班吉
Benji!

1467
02:03:43,790 --> 02:03:45,360
伊尔莎  你在哪儿
Ilsa, where are you?

1468
02:03:46,890 --> 02:03:48,850
你不会想看到这一幕的
You don't want to see this.

1469
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:51,670
班吉
Benji!

1470
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:53,590
-伊尔莎  -班吉
- Ilsa! - Benji!

1471
02:03:53,650 --> 02:03:55,910
班吉  班吉  别过来
Benji! Benji, stop!

1472
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:26,150
班吉
Benji!

1473
02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:54,330
不  不要
Oh, no, no, no!

1474
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:34,920
稳住  稳住
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1475
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:40,040
不要  我就快要成功了  坚持住
No, no. Not when I'm this close.

1476
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:41,570
拜托  拜托
Come on, come on!

1477
02:07:27,630 --> 02:07:28,770
谢了
Thank you.

1478
02:07:28,770 --> 02:07:30,070
把他捆起来
Tie him up.

1479
02:08:33,450 --> 02:08:36,420
你给我去死吧
Why won't you just die?

1480
02:08:57,890 --> 02:08:59,890
你也帮不上什么忙了
There's nothing else you can do.

1481
02:09:01,650 --> 02:09:03,490
去找你的丈夫吧
Go be with your husband.

1482
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:06,200
路德
Luther...

1483
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:07,840
去吧
Go.

1484
02:09:20,990 --> 02:09:22,580
班吉  你在哪儿
Benji, where are you?

1485
02:09:22,580 --> 02:09:24,420
路德  我们在屋里  接下来怎么办
Okay, Luther, we're inside. Tell us what to do.

1486
02:09:24,420 --> 02:09:26,850
你们应该能看见连着主板的红线
You should see the red wire attached to the motherboard.

1487
02:09:26,850 --> 02:09:27,410
是的
Yeah.

1488
02:09:27,410 --> 02:09:31,400
把它和旁边的绿线同时剪断
You need to cut that and the green wire next to it simultaneously.

1489
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:33,020
-好  准备好了吗  -嗯
- Okay, ready? - Mmm-hmm.

1490
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:34,880
预备  剪
Set. Go.

1491
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:39,360
我说了  那是无可阻止的
I told you. It can't be stopped.

1492
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:41,290
你们什么也做不了
There's nothing you can do.

1493
02:12:59,220 --> 02:13:02,400
班吉  听好  逆时针拧开螺丝
Benji, listen. Turn the screw counterclockwise.

1494
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:03,530
好
Yep.

1495
02:13:04,570 --> 02:13:06,130
移开表盘  你会看到
Remove that panel and you'll see

1496
02:13:06,130 --> 02:13:08,530
电源和引信的地线
the power and ground wires for the fuse.

1497
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:09,260
明白
Got it.

1498
02:13:09,260 --> 02:13:11,500
时间一到就剪绿线
When the time comes, cut the green wire.

1499
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:12,800
现在别剪
Do not cut it yet.

1500
02:13:12,810 --> 02:13:14,160
好的  收到
Okay. We copy.

1501
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:22,470
伊森  你能听到我说话吗  我们要剪了
Ethan, if you can hear me, we're ready to make the cut.

1502
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,460
伊森  请回答
Ethan, come in.

1503
02:13:24,640 --> 02:13:27,610
班吉  我们怎么知道他拿没拿到引爆键
Benji, how do we know if he's got the key?

1504
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:28,980
他会拿到的
He'll get it.

1505
02:13:28,980 --> 02:13:31,800
-就算是  我们怎么知道  -他一定能搞定
- Yeah, but how do we know? - He'll get it done!

1506
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:39,790
就快没时间了  只能希望他拿到了
We're out of time. We just have to hope he has it.

1507
02:13:39,790 --> 02:13:41,900
-好  准备好了  -剩两秒时剪下去
- Okay, we're ready. - At two seconds we cut.

1508
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:43,590
等一下  为什么是两秒  不是一秒
Wait, wait, wait! Why two? Why not one?

1509
02:13:43,590 --> 02:13:44,780
你要把时间卡那么紧吗
You want to cut it that close?

1510
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:46,200
那一秒可能会万劫不复  无法弥补
It's a second we'll never get back.

1511
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:47,560
到底什么时候  能赶快做个决定吗
When? Can we make a decision on this?

1512
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:48,850
好  好  剩一秒再剪
All right, all right! We'll do it on one.

1513
02:13:48,850 --> 02:13:49,590
一秒的时候吗
Cutting on one?

1514
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:51,450
没错  一秒  好了  准备
Yes, one. All right, stand by.

1515
02:13:53,790 --> 02:13:55,080
三
Three...

1516
02:13:55,270 --> 02:13:56,880
-二  -一
- Two... - One.

1517
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:58,120
剪
Now!

1518
02:14:36,310 --> 02:14:37,620
好了
Okay.

1519
02:14:48,770 --> 02:14:50,260
老天啊
My man.

1520
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:38,730
伊森
Ethan?

1521
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:42,240
伊森
Ethan?

1522
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:44,970
能听见吗
Can you hear me?

1523
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:49,900
能听见吗
Can you hear me?

1524
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:57,670
别动
Don't try to move.

1525
02:15:58,020 --> 02:16:00,590
别动  你伤得很重
Don't move. You're pretty banged up.

1526
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:04,980
你可够走运的
You're a lucky man.

1527
02:16:05,030 --> 02:16:07,610
坠机还没死真是奇迹啊  索恩医生
It's a miracle that crash didn't kill you, Dr. Thorne.

1528
02:16:08,180 --> 02:16:09,580
你朋友要是再晚一小时找到你
If your friend didn't find you an hour later,

1529
02:16:09,580 --> 02:16:11,220
你就要死在爆炸里了
you would've died of exposure.

1530
02:16:11,310 --> 02:16:13,030
-我朋友  -是啊
- My friends? - Yeah.

1531
02:16:15,740 --> 02:16:17,830
你走之后没多久她就来了
She got here not long after you left.

1532
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,680
还搬来了半个印度军队
Right in front of half the Indian Army.

1533
02:16:21,410 --> 02:16:23,760
能让我们单独待一会吗
Can you give us a few minutes, please?

1534
02:16:25,780 --> 02:16:27,730
回头见  医生
See you later, Doc.

1535
02:16:34,290 --> 02:16:35,680
茱莉亚
Julia...

1536
02:16:37,130 --> 02:16:38,650
对不起
I'm sorry.

1537
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,790
你不需要向我道歉
There's no reason to be sorry.

1538
02:16:40,790 --> 02:16:41,880
不
No.

1539
02:16:41,880 --> 02:16:43,530
真的对不起
I'm sorry

1540
02:16:44,810 --> 02:16:47,000
为所有的事  我...
for everything. I...

1541
02:16:48,350 --> 02:16:49,680
你看看我
Look at me.

1542
02:16:50,590 --> 02:16:52,090
看看我
Look at me.

1543
02:16:52,410 --> 02:16:54,060
再看看我的生活
Look at my life.

1544
02:16:55,630 --> 02:16:59,500
我热爱我的事业  如果不是遇到你
I love what I do, and I never would have

1545
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:01,480
我永远也意识不到这一点
found this if I hadn't met you.

1546
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:06,270
所有发生过的事  都让我认清我是怎样一个人
And everything that happened, it taught me who I am.

1547
02:17:06,270 --> 02:17:10,730
让我明白自身的能力  我...
It showed me what I am capable of, and I...

1548
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:13,080
我是个幸存者
I am a survivor.

1549
02:17:13,630 --> 02:17:15,570
但这里发生的事
But what happened here,

1550
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:18,600
-都是因为我...  -没有发生任何事
- it was my... - Nothing happened.

1551
02:17:18,750 --> 02:17:20,760
因为有你在
Because you were here.

1552
02:17:22,790 --> 02:17:26,550
每晚我能安然入睡  也是因为知道你一直在
And I sleep soundly at night knowing you always will be.

1553
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:36,800
你幸福吗
You're happy?

1554
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:38,330
非常幸福
Very.

1555
02:17:41,420 --> 02:17:43,670
我找到了我命中注定的归属
I'm exactly where I should be.

1556
02:17:46,100 --> 02:17:47,860
你也是
And so are you.

1557
02:18:27,050 --> 02:18:28,900
应你的要求
Per your request,

1558
02:18:30,150 --> 02:18:33,820
我将把所罗门·莱恩交给军情六处
I'm handing Solomon Lane back to MI6.

1559
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:40,320
当然  要经由中间人
Through a broker, of course.

1560
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:45,330
那也是我们协议中的一部分
Part of our ongoing arrangement.

1561
02:18:50,470 --> 02:18:52,620
经过巴黎的事情之后
After what happened in Paris,

1562
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:55,920
我们希望能保持低调
we prefer to keep a low profile.

1563
02:18:58,040 --> 02:19:02,430
你朋友和英国情报机构的旧账也一笔勾销
And that closes your friend's account with British Intelligence.

1564
02:19:04,490 --> 02:19:07,050
肋骨疼  小心我的肋骨
The ribs. Watch the ribs.

1565
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:10,490
我现在明白为什么汉利那么信任你了
I understand now why Hunley believed in you.

1566
02:19:11,170 --> 02:19:13,960
世界需要IMF
The world needs the IMF.

1567
02:19:14,330 --> 02:19:16,660
我们需要你这样的人
We need people like you

1568
02:19:16,730 --> 02:19:19,000
对个体性命的在乎程度
who care about the one life

1569
02:19:19,490 --> 02:19:22,260
和对千百万人性命的在乎程度一样
as much as they care about the millions.

1570
02:19:24,090 --> 02:19:27,340
那样我就不需要操心了
That way I never have to.

1571
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:29,670
你还好吗
You okay?

1572
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:32,380
你现在真是前所未有得帅
You've never looked better.

1573
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:34,550
拜托  别取笑我了
Don't. Please.

1574
02:19:35,510 --> 02:19:37,100
最后一刻有多危急
How close were we?

1575
02:19:39,830 --> 02:19:41,280
和平常一样
The usual.

1576
02:19:45,190 --> 02:19:46,530
和平常一样吗
The usual?

1577
02:19:48,410 --> 02:19:50,320
别逗我笑了
Please don't make me laugh.
