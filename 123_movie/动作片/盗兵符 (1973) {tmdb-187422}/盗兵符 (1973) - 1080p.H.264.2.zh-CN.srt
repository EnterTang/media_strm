1
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,172
During the period of the
'Warring States', 257B.C.,

2
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,341
Emperor Chin was tyrannical

3
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,217
Encroaching others' territories,
he killed mercilessly

4
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,171
He attacked the State of Chao
& took several cities

5
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,409
Imperial palaces were renovated
extravagantly

6
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,612
People of Chao are in great suffering

7
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,817
The troops led by Emperor Chin himself

8
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:10,153
are heading towards Han Dan

9
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:14,495
The State of Chao will soon fall
in the hands of Chin

10
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:18,901
and our State of Wei will be next

11
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,807
Master Hau, no need to say it

12
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,908
I believe that they'll be stopped
sooner or later

13
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,105
That's impossible

14
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,549
I'll be crossing the river immediately

15
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,584
You'll be getting good news in
about 3 days' time

16
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,647
What's your name please?

17
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:35,778
I am Zhu Hai

18
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,490
Da Liang City hero;
your great reputation precedes you

19
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:42,862
You flatter me

20
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,998
I'm just a nobody

21
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,727
I only hope to do something

22
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,665
Goodbye

23
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:50,832
Hero

24
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,568
Since you are in a hurry,
I shouldn't say more

25
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,837
I hope that you will take
good care of yourself

26
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,345
I'll be visiting you again some other time

27
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,106
Yes Sir

28
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,370
"Ping Yi Palace"

29
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,269
Yin Yue, listen carefully

30
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,136
Be careful in what you say

31
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,825
Catch him, chase...

32
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,032
Chase...

33
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,299
Men, catch the assassin

34
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,396
Yes

35
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:36,672
Catch the assassin

36
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,572
Stand still

37
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,182
Your Highness

38
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,731
It's no use, the assasin has escaped

39
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,697
I deserve death for my lax security

40
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:06,768
The assassin is trapped owing to
Sire's sharp-Wit

41
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:12,807
Come

42
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,409
It's lucky that you are smart

43
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,952
and didn't fall into Emperor Chin's trap

44
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,747
I'm ashamed

45
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,982
If it were not because of that palace maid

46
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,525
whose etiquette was not
appropriate for an Emperor

47
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,322
I would have killed 2 fake ones and gone

48
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,755
Wouldn't have bothered perhaps
looking for the third

49
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,832
The third one is fake too

50
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,028
Please take a seat...

51
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:43,933
Brother, this morning someone saw him

52
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,206
giving orders to attack the city

53
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:55,848
Emperor Chin is ruthless

54
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,185
He'd of course take precautions
against assassins

55
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:02,354
It's easy for him to find someone
to die in his place

56
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:09,732
That's why mere courage won't solve
the problem

57
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,929
Even if it succeeded by sheer luck

58
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,530
Chin could easily appoint another one

59
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,667
It'd simply be changing one tyranny
for another

60
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,144
A true hero should first
unite all feudal princes...

61
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,812
against tyranny, and rescue
the State of Chao

62
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,924
I am nothing but a commoner...

63
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,392
No, all play a part in the rise
and fall of a nation

64
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,090
You should make good use of your skills

65
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,462
to join force against tyranny

66
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,531
Our State of Wei has no news of
sending troops

67
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,900
That's right, Brother Bai Chi
is a palace guard

68
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:46,937
of course he'll know

69
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:52,637
Sooner or later, Prince Shun Ling

70
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,408
will join hands against the tyranny
of Chin

71
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,644
Also, the State of Chao
& feudal princes of our nation

72
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,014
...are relatives

73
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,481
Your Highness

74
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,890
Bai Chi who's ordered to act as
State of Wei's spy

75
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,358
is here for Your Highness

76
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,260
By the order of His Highness,
send Bai Chi in

77
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,366
Send Bai Chi in

78
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,417
Greetings to Your Highness

79
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:39,983
Rise

80
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,059
It is...guilty, I won't dare to

81
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:51,636
Sire, I've found the whereabouts
of the assassin

82
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,497
You've done well, rise and speak

83
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,371
Thank you, your Highness

84
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,641
You've found out his whereabouts

85
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,303
He's Zhu Hai from the State of Wei

86
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,314
I have pretended to befriend him

87
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,111
and intend to get rid of him by fraud

88
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,316
You should rather watch closely
to see if Wei

89
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,856
will send troops to Chao's rescue.
This way...

90
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,155
your identity as Wei's palace guard
won't be exposed

91
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,392
It's quite unlikely that Wei
will send troops

92
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,401
In Yeh Ha which is 60 miles away from here

93
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,405
Jin Bi is leading a troop of 1 00,000

94
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,399
But Wei's prince for the sake of Chao

95
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,443
wouldn't dare offend Your Highness

96
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,309
You should know that

97
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:37,371
Chao's Princess is the sister
of the prince of Wei and

98
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,781
pretty close to her younger brother
Prince Shun Ling

99
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,685
At the critical moment

100
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,381
she will definitely seek help
from the prince of Wei

101
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,023
Did you come because of this?

102
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
Yes

103
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,321
Han Dan is in great danger

104
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,092
It'll be too late

105
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,431
to wait till tomorrow

106
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,136
Sounds reasonable

107
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,906
but it's not that easy to re-locate troops

108
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,569
Jin Bi is leading a troop of 1 00,000
in Yeh Ha

109
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,545
They can arrive in one day
to release Han Dan

110
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,848
But Jin Bi's troops...

111
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,385
His troop guards the border
and cannot be relocated

112
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,024
Your Highness, I travelled non-stop from

113
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,787
the State of Chao, hoping that

114
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,489
for the sake of our relationship,
& considering that

115
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:31,162
Ruthless Chin has been invading
others' territories

116
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,036
The State of Wei is also in danger

117
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,603
Rescuing Chao is...is...

118
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,218
beyond our power

119
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:55,192
In terms of relation Lady Ping Yuan
is your sister;

120
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,224
the States of Chao and of Wei
are neighbours

121
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:03,359
The tyrannical Chin after acquiring
the State of Chao

122
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,198
will attack the State of Wei

123
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,201
Please rescue Chao for the sake
of our brotherhood

124
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,509
It's an important matter to save
the State of Chao

125
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,110
We'll wait until tomorrow
when the court meets

126
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,316
and seek Su Song's advice

127
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,823
As the saying goes, to each his own

128
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,024
Although you are the brother
of His Highness

129
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,499
you both are so different

130
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,636
Sending troops in Chao's aid is
risking self for others

131
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,901
His Highness won't agree to it

132
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,245
His Highness may seek advice
of the lmperial Teacher

133
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,804
Please explain what I've said just now

134
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,884
to His Highness

135
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,952
It won't be easy

136
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:58,523
After all, it's not his own business

137
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,156
States are interdependent on each other

138
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,696
This is something which will happen
in future

139
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,960
It may not be easy to convince
His Highness now

140
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:16,837
So Lady Ping Yuan will waste her effort

141
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,311
His Highness won't be able to send troops

142
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,880
I can't be of any further help

143
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,385
If this is the case, I can only lead

144
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:29,749
all my guests, servants

145
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,255
and Lady Ping Yuan to fight for
the State of Chao

146
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,889
Well...your followers & servants
are no more than

147
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,260
a few thousand

148
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,357
Compared with the Chin troops

149
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,437
they are up against insurmountable odds

150
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,903
It's worth dying for a cause

151
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,170
we shouldn't think too much about
winning and losing

152
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,677
Goodbye

153
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:55,879
Prince

154
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:58,847
Sister

155
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,851
What you've just said deserves
great reverence

156
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,755
You will be well respected if you lead

157
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,762
your followers and servants
to fight for Chao

158
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,595
But what good will there be
for the State of Chao?

159
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,530
Father and I have just been

160
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,696
discussing about the affairs
of the State of Chao

161
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,967
We were talking about Jin Bi's troops

162
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,406
when you arrived

163
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,940
I guess not only is the king
against sending troops

164
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,448
the generals & the army is also
afraid of Chin's terror

165
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,118
Go ahead, feel free to say it

166
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:39,924
Han Dan and Yeh Ha are only
tens of miles apart

167
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,186
If Jin Bi can make a show of power

168
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,785
Chin won't dare to march in

169
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,166
Good idea

170
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,069
If we can convince His Highness
and you lead

171
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:56,130
the army on behalf of Jin Bi,
Chao will be saved

172
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,577
As long as the State of Chao can be saved

173
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,076
I am willing to risk my life for it

174
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:04,580
Even without any military power

175
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:08,414
you are already revered by all

176
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,319
His Highness may not give you
the military power

177
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,558
There's no way you can replace Jin Bi

178
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,064
His Highness admires sister

179
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,005
Dad, is this true?

180
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,873
Yes, about half a month ago

181
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,946
His Highness gave me a piece of jade

182
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,615
Pisces Jade

183
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:41,413
It is as famous as Wo's Jade

184
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,784
There is a yin jade and a yang jade

185
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,919
His Highness is wearing the yang jade and

186
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:50,394
it's for obvious reason that
he gave me this yin jade

187
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,724
Dad, what do you mean?

188
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,662
No one knows a daughter better than
her own father

189
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,564
I'm just pretending not to
understand his real purpose

190
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,967
and wearing the piece of jade all the time

191
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,335
His Highness hasn't raised the issue again

192
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,339
If you agree

193
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,071
Sister would be like a hostage
to His Highness

194
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,703
With you leading the troops of Wei

195
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,247
His Highness would not have to worry

196
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,715
What do you think?

197
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,385
No

198
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,139
You are focused on rescuing
the State of Chao

199
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,111
Although I'm not able to convince
His Highness

200
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,681
I'll try my best

201
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:44,680
This...

202
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,217
and convince him of the pros and cons

203
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,894
I better get writing tomorrow's memo,
please excuse me

204
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:19,568
Looking at the moon, I muse

205
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:31,487
While my heart is full of perplexity

206
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:39,759
It used to beat only for the moon

207
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:47,601
But he bathes all in his light

208
00:16:48,640 --> 00:17:04,512
Why won't it shine only on me?

209
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:12,621
It does not appreciate my song

210
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:21,435
Nor does it understand my meaning

211
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:29,675
I can only pine in vain

212
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:41,660
Pine until my heartstrings break

213
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,872
Yes, I was on guard that day

214
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,951
and heard Su Song talking like this
at the palace

215
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,020
but Prince of Wei did not agree

216
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,487
That's why His Highness sent me over

217
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,750
to help you

218
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:13,825
This...

219
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,191
What? Are there problems in
killing Su Song?

220
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,194
Originally you were to assassinate
Prince Shun Ling

221
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,799
but I told His Highness that

222
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,464
Prince Shun Ling has many followers

223
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,474
and is an expert in kung fu

224
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,407
Therefore it will be hard to kill him

225
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,947
Killing Su Song may help
to teach them a lesson

226
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,979
I'm afraid that my identity will be
exposed and then

227
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,880
I won't be able to stay at
the State of Wei anymore

228
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,746
You don't have to do it yourself

229
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,657
Use this as a false accusation
against Su Song

230
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,194
and convince Zhu to assassinate him

231
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,497
Is he supposed to come today?

232
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,329
Yes

233
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:58,933
Zhu Hai is here

234
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,161
Let's retire

235
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:05,700
Coming...

236
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:15,547
Brother Bai

237
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,654
Please have a look

238
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,062
Dear Su Song, you're the man
of Emperor Chin

239
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,233
This is real

240
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,633
It's the fact

241
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,899
Before you came

242
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,567
I've decided to kill that traitor tonight

243
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,802
but I'm afraid that I'll fail

244
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,508
so...I'd like...

245
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,979
Brother Bai, can I help?

246
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,989
You are a great fighter, you will succeed

247
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,682
but this is too dangerous

248
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,783
What? You think l...

249
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:59,330
Yes, that's for the people,
please accept my salute

250
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,370
I'm getting old

251
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,075
It's late now

252
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,714
Why don't you rest?

253
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,814
I've been thinking about what you told me

254
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,013
Will the State of Chao be saved

255
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,056
if we send troops to their rescue?

256
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,058
Of course

257
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,686
Presently Chin acts reckless because

258
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,322
they think that no one dares
to go against them

259
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,129
Dispatch of troops from Wei
is psychological warfare

260
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,703
Chin will be less tyrannical

261
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,272
if it knows that

262
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,206
the princes are united in
fighting against tyranny

263
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,309
Is there any other way

264
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,640
other than sacrificing me?

265
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:52,909
Hardly

266
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,718
His Highness will not trust me in leading

267
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:01,725
Jin Bi's troops if you are not his wife

268
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,522
What about the Prince?

269
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,766
If he is not able to rescue

270
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,996
the State of Chao

271
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,471
he will regret it for the rest of his life

272
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,003
There must be a better way

273
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,742
Zhu Hai's greetings to teacher

274
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,579
At this late an hour with your sword...!

275
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,853
I'd like to seek your advice

276
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,827
His Highness agreeing to aid
State of Chao; is it true?

277
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,665
Why do you say that?

278
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,928
Didn't you write a memorial to Chin?

279
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,100
You come here at this late hour
talking nonsense

280
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,173
Don't be angry, please have a look

281
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,917
It's a fake one

282
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,811
I deserve death, I trusted the liar
Bai Chi

283
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:04,581
Bai Chi

284
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,056
Bai Chi the palace guard

285
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,632
It's him, he gave me this memorial

286
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,428
I'll come to apologiZe after
I settle this with him

287
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,869
Yu Er, you can see for yourself that

288
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,503
even he wants to fight
against tyranny, but you...

289
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,651
Yu Er

290
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,947
Dad, don't say it

291
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:41,124
I will fulfil his wish

292
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:18,892
Who are you?

293
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,060
Guards, there's an assassin!

294
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:32,973
Bai Chi

295
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,277
Dad

296
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:17,713
What is it?

297
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,051
It's been poisoned

298
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,216
Stop joking

299
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,187
This is the wine Bai Chi
has prepared for celebration

300
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,993
after Zhu Hai has killed Su Song

301
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,235
Where's Zhu Hai?

302
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,965
Not back yet

303
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,302
Zhu Hai saw through our plan

304
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,899
Let's go, hurry

305
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,772
Okay

306
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,443
Where's Su Song?

307
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,803
He's been killed

308
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,608
Hurry, pack up and leave Dai Liang

309
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:47,412
Alright

310
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:48,942
It's too late now

311
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:51,988
You've to payback for Su Song's life

312
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,847
Sister

313
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:01,790
What's done is done, don't be sad

314
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,192
Yes

315
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:07,629
I've just spoken to Master Hau
about revenge

316
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,901
Bai Chi is from Chin

317
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,403
He serves as a palace guard
but actually is a spy

318
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,974
Last night Zhu Hai killed his whole family

319
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,100
but Bai Chi escaped

320
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,945
I've decided to send Nam Gung Fei to Chin

321
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,244
Zhu Hai blamed himself
and wished to come along

322
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,982
and took Bai Chi

323
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,714
Prince, I let you make the decision

324
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,989
Sister, don't cry

325
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,792
My sister will help you
to take care of the affairs

326
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,128
I'll arrange for Zhu Hai to go to Chin

327
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:47,863
By His Highness' order-Bai Chi
being the palace guard

328
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:52,569
of the State of Wei served loyally
for our country

329
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,840
He will be sent to the Slave Camp

330
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,182
Come...

331
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,750
How dare you, Lord Yu

332
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,752
I was promised promotion
after I've killed Su Song

333
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,082
I'm willing to render service in gratitude

334
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,487
That's correct

335
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,388
To the slave camp

336
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,791
This is how you'll be rewarded

337
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,165
You have great achievements
at the State of Wei

338
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,097
A lot of people know you

339
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,170
that's why you have to be defaced

340
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:20,129
Lord Yu

341
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,069
I risked my life for the services

342
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,504
please plead with His Highness
to change decision...

343
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:27,044
Sire said you may also seek merit
for service to nation

344
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:31,138
So you'll have many complaints
at the encampment, too

345
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,740
For this reason your tongue
will be cut off too

346
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:35,981
Go...

347
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:39,579
Lord Yu...

348
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,258
"Slave Camp"

349
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:06,842
Get in

350
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,109
Come, release all the slaves out

351
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,482
to fend off the Chin troops

352
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,179
Alright

353
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,887
Don't move...

354
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,791
Don't be afraid, I'm here to rescue you

355
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,221
Good news?

356
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,384
How can there be good news?

357
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,757
His Highness wants to take Miss Su
as his concubine

358
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,459
Su Song pretended not to understand

359
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,797
This is now the golden opportunity

360
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,797
But...if sister is reluctant to...

361
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,437
No need to worry

362
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:29,035
If Your Highness could avenge her

363
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,809
Miss Su will agree

364
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,619
True. Prepare for ceremony
and escort her to the palace

365
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,448
Yes

366
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:42,315
Bai Chi has been arrested at the
Chin's slave camp

367
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,190
Unfortunately his tongue has been cut off

368
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:48,189
Everyone in the camp is like this

369
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,462
Strange. He has accomplished
great services for Chin

370
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,766
how come he ends up in the slave camp?

371
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,501
Bai Chi can no longer stay
at the State of Wei

372
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,907
He's of no use

373
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:04,209
to Chin anymore

374
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:12,484
Prince, this is the piece of jade
found on him

375
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,096
Pisces jade

376
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,496
Report to the Prince,
Lady Ping Yuan is back

377
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,794
Where's Miss Su?

378
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:24,925
Haven't seen her

379
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,370
Your Highness, Miss Su arrives

380
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:37,676
No need to stand on ceremony

381
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:38,544
Thank you, Your Highness

382
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:53,488
Beg your pardon for not changing
to right attire

383
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,126
Rise

384
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,736
My wish has been conveyed to you

385
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,571
Yes

386
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,266
Thank you for your great kindness

387
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,346
No need to stand on ceremonies, rise

388
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:16,985
Don't worry, I've issued great awards

389
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,886
to avenge teacher

390
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,185
Thank you, Your Highness

391
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,697
For your own safety

392
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,025
you should stay at the palace

393
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,898
This mansion will be cleaned up
for your stay

394
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:42,305
Thank you, but my father
has just passed away

395
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:47,578
I'm in mourning; such an
elegant mansion isn't apt

396
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,748
That's easy. Remove all the decoration

397
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:51,514
Yes

398
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:57,654
Please forgive me, I've still to
observe mourning

399
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,490
It's for your safety that I asked you
to move in

400
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:04,398
and besides, we can see each other
more often

401
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,834
Are you disobeying my order?

402
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,996
I don't dare to

403
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,937
That's good. Rise

404
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,175
I don't dare disobey Your Highness' order

405
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,716
but I still have to avenge
my father's death

406
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,683
Please forgive me for not seeing you

407
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,585
Then...can't I even see you here?

408
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,782
Please forgive me

409
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,056
If I'm forced to, I'd rather die

410
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,526
Alright, as you wish

411
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,662
Thank you, Your Highness

412
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,508
The murderer is caught

413
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,513
Sister has gone to the palace

414
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,849
That's right. Since she's there she could

415
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,386
convince His Highness to
send troops in Chao's aid

416
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,614
It's no use

417
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,553
How is that?

418
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,351
His Highness wants to take Miss Su
as his concubine

419
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,622
but he can't succeed

420
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,891
Now he took her into his palace

421
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,489
There is nothing else His Highness desires

422
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,398
there's no hope for the troops to be sent

423
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:17,598
Then Han Dan is in great danger

424
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,768
Sister, Master Hau must find a way

425
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:24,143
Stealing military tally is the only way

426
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:28,412
You will lead Jin Bi's troops
to rescue Han Dan

427
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,646
But the military tally is placed
in the vault

428
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,689
The key of which is always
with His Highness

429
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,884
That's not difficult, Miss Su can do it

430
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,051
Then...

431
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,097
Now that Bai Chi is caught

432
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,497
Miss Su should declare her vengeance

433
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:47,367
Yes, sister has sworn an oath that

434
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,736
she'll marry whoever avenges
her father's death

435
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,571
Madam must now visit Miss Su
& secretly tell her that

436
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,242
the murderer will be sacrificed
before Teacher's grave

437
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,178
You ask Ms Su to steal the tally
and bring it to you

438
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,986
But the vault is guarded strongly

439
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:10,355
That's not difficult either

440
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:13,225
Pick a brave but not reckless man and

441
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,630
bring Bai Chi's head along with him
to the palace

442
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,634
as a moral support to Miss Su

443
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,863
I can go to the palace and
be Miss Su's support

444
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,338
Alright. Good

445
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:29,774
Do as planned

446
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:42,448
Dad, Prince has caught the murderer

447
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,495
In order that I can avenge your death

448
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,656
I swore that

449
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,757
the Prince would decide my fate

450
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:54,031
I've been asked to steal
the military tally

451
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,469
and I have agreed

452
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:07,647
Dad said that Prince and
I should not be separated

453
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,721
In Prince's heart, I am not
as important as

454
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,585
rescuing the State of Chao

455
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,023
In order to fulfil his wish

456
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,186
I'll sacrifice my love for honour

457
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:29,897
Sister

458
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,708
I cannot repay your great favour enough

459
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,302
I will try my best to fulfil your wish

460
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,317
Thank you, Sister

461
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,480
I've discussed this matter

462
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,919
with Master Hau

463
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:49,686
The military tally of Yeh Ha
is of the shape of a tiger

464
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:52,922
I remember when Jin Bi was sending troops

465
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:57,024
The key to the vault is carried by

466
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,294
His Highness

467
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,862
Only those close to him
can have access to it

468
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,506
We've to wait until Bai Chi
is killed and sacrificed

469
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:08,442
Zhu Hai will bring his head
to His Highness to seek

470
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,481
offers as guard, but in fact
to liaise with sister

471
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,849
Stealing the tally deserves death penalty

472
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,986
therefore...

473
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:27,761
So I hope sister can go with me
to the State of Chao

474
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,328
Return to the State of Chao?

475
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,063
Yes, I swear an oath in front of
Teacher's grave

476
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,199
Prince

477
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,106
Sister

478
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,113
Prince, the time has come,
please offer the sacrifice

479
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,522
Yes, offer the sacrifice

480
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,083
This is really the head of Bai Chi

481
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,320
You are loyal to the country; and...

482
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,987
since you requested to serve as
palace guard, enter

483
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,792
Thank you, Your Highness

484
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,748
His Highness arrives

485
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:11,864
No need to stand on ceremony

486
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,330
You have your revenge

487
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,332
This is the head of your enemy Bai Chi

488
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:22,943
Take it away

489
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:23,706
Yes

490
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,449
It's too terrible

491
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:30,383
Sister

492
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,383
Thank you, Your Highness

493
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,591
No need to stand on ceremony

494
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,198
Pisces jade

495
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:49,372
Teacher had prophesied joy
when both pieces match

496
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:54,206
This has finally come true, reward him

497
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,145
The divine intelligence of His Highness

498
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,747
Your Highness, General Tung Gou Chung,

499
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,479
reports to your majesty

500
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,980
Bring him to the front room

501
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,559
He...he is at the palace gate

502
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,227
May I be excused

503
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:15,994
Send him in

504
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,930
Yes

505
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,896
Tung Gou Chung's greetings to
Your Highness

506
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,439
I've collected the rice tax from Mong Man

507
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,710
and there's a total of 50 carts

508
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,451
It's all been delivered to
General Jin Bi at Yeh Ha

509
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,618
and I'm here to return the tally

510
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:51,297
Good

511
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,498
Lord Tung Guo will take the post

512
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,401
as Minister of the lmperial Guard

513
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,302
Yes

514
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,106
Lord Tung Guo transferred to be
the Minister

515
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,336
and is in charge of the lmperial Guards

516
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,178
Thank you, Your Majesty

517
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,285
Sister

518
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:14,589
Your Highness

519
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,559
Please wait

520
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,525
I'll put back the military tally
in the vault

521
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:19,357
Yes

522
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,664
Your Highness

523
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:29,135
What is it?

524
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,402
Bai Chi's head is frightening

525
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,343
please let someone else take the tally

526
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,414
Well...

527
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,280
No one can get into the vault

528
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,544
except me

529
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,985
Can I not go in with you too?

530
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,053
Of course you can

531
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,488
Let's go

532
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:09,406
His Highness arrives

533
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,099
"The Vault"

534
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,910
Let's go

535
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:12,760
Guards

536
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:17,036
Yes

537
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:52,834
Sister

538
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:58,145
Why are you crying?

539
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,496
Aren't you happy at this?

540
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:21,897
I...I am just too happy

541
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:29,508
In that case, laugh. One cries only
when sad

542
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:33,082
Please pardon my inappropriate behaviour

543
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,450
From now onwards you will be the princess

544
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,490
Yes

545
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:43,950
Don't have any doubts,
& you shouldn't cry today

546
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,030
You should smile

547
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:52,302
Laugh

548
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,993
Lady, His Highness won't trust anyone for

549
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,038
the military tally

550
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,140
How dare you disobey orders!

551
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,533
You disobey orders by entering the vault

552
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,878
How dare you!

553
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:19,449
Disperse

554
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:27,819
Back off

555
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:31,658
Lady, please wait

556
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,161
Allow me to seek the advice of
His Highness

557
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,166
Attack

558
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:58,907
Wait

559
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,983
Lady will die if you come any further

560
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:54,870
Please convey to the Prince
I've to bid him farewell

561
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,306
What? Aren't you leaving?

562
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,239
Prince said he'll be waiting for you
at the Yi Gate

563
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:08,547
I'd be like a fugitive going with
the Prince to Chao

564
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,279
This was not thoroughly thought out

565
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,411
You...

566
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:13,420
Have you forgotten the Prince's oath
to you?

567
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:22,359
Prince has a strong ambition,
he won't miss me

568
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:25,457
Besides, I am different now

569
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,037
You are now a princess, you're different

570
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:32,141
I'm leaving

571
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:35,843
Huh!

572
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,682
What is it?

573
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,160
Yu Jiang leading Zhu Hai with the key
to the vault

574
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,561
entered it by force

575
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,190
The 1 2 men guarding the vault
tried to stop them

576
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,598
There were serious casualties

577
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,330
One of them who was seriously wounded

578
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:04,271
came back to report and
is now outside the palace

579
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,805
Order General Bai Li Ho

580
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,605
wait for further instructions at the vault

581
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:09,474
Yes

582
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:22,854
Prince, I believe even if you wait
until dawn

583
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:23,983
the Lady won't come back

584
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,541
If you see the Lady

585
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:45,012
please convey my wish to her

586
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,776
wishing her riches and glory

587
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:59,961
Speak, who sent out the tally for you?

588
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,928
Fight against Chin not only means
rescue of...

589
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,556
the State of Chao, it's also saving
our own country

590
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,999
Any man with a vision will do
the same thing

591
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:07,397
Nonsense

592
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:09,564
Calm down, Your Highness

593
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:14,768
Prince Shun Ling's men are
a band of scoundrels

594
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,779
It's not difficult to take
the tally out of the palace

595
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:24,820
He has to leave by the Yi Gate to go
to Yeh Ha

596
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,451
I'll stop him there

597
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:29,286
Alright

598
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,556
You anticipated correctly

599
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,490
Speak

600
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,471
Prince knew that you will stop him
at Yi Gate

601
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,306
so he has detoured via the South Gate

602
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,139
Tung Guo Chung

603
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:53,044
Yes

604
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,242
You hurry to South Gate. Just nab
& execute him

605
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:55,977
Yes

606
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,178
"Yi Gate"

607
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,292
The troops are behind us

608
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,672
Prince, come and hide over here

609
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:24,945
Wait

610
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:45,126
You said the Prince has left
via the south gate

611
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,965
Luckily I took a short cut and
passed the Yi Gate

612
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:50,361
Prince, surrender please

613
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,405
Chase

614
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,316
Yu Jiang stole the tally for Wu Ji

615
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:11,410
How can you take her word
& go to the South Gate

616
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:16,753
I deserve death

617
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,087
Your Highness

618
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,823
The Prince just pretends to be good

619
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:26,197
his followers are a band of scoundrels

620
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:28,600
It's difficult to guard against treachery

621
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:34,772
Since there's just Lady Ping Yuan
in Prince's home

622
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:38,143
I fear there'll be an ambush
at the Yi Gate

623
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,580
If Master Bai Li fails to get
to Yeh Ha and

624
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:44,915
meets Jin Bi, he'll catch up
with the Prince

625
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,684
I'm afraid that he's no match for Wu Ji

626
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,594
Your Highness, I am willing to take
the short cut

627
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,755
to Yeh Ha to arrest Wu Ji

628
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,432
Alright, go to Yeh Ha then

629
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,800
Send orders to Jin Bi to arrest Wu Ji

630
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:03,467
Thank you Your Highness

631
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:17,518
Greetings to the Lady

632
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:24,192
I'm sorry to have troubled you

633
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,630
What happened today is really amaZing

634
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,260
Before the stealing of the military tally

635
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,498
I've already prepared for the punishment

636
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:40,667
You'd have then left with the Prince
to State of Chao

637
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:44,440
Once Chao is rid of danger,
Prince will be prosperous

638
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:48,475
Do you know that the Prince almost

639
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,849
messed up when you didn't show up
at the Yi Gate

640
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:56,489
I'm already the wife of His Highness

641
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,288
If I went with him to the State of Chao

642
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:01,056
he would be guilty of stealing the tally

643
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:03,098
and taking his brother's wife

644
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:10,330
Why I don't let the Prince to get

645
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,806
fame and the glory

646
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,672
and let me bear the guilt

647
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:17,772
Then the Prince would have misjudged you

648
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:26,516
In the process, I only hope that
I don't owe anyone

649
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:30,090
Prince will...

650
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:31,490
...He'll know one day

651
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:34,796
You've really suffered

652
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:38,392
I'll let my brother know

653
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:44,836
Order him to send Han Chi to Yeh Ha

654
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:47,474
Master Bai Li

655
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,535
Master Lin?

656
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:50,674
I don't deserve it

657
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,512
Master Bai Li, you are in Mong Yi
at this late hour...

658
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:58,986
By His Highness' order, I'm here to
arrest Wu Ji

659
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,583
Isn't Prince Shun Ling in Da Liang?

660
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,887
He stole the tally and left for Yeh Ha

661
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,055
I've searched all the inns
at the main road

662
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,498
Seems he's taken a shortcut
as there's no sign of him

663
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:15,400
Short cut, huh! Then Mong Yi
must be the only way

664
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,736
Master Bai Li, you may wish to go in
& have a look

665
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,173
He really hasn't been here

666
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,340
You really foretell things accurately

667
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,181
Master Bai Li is here for the tally

668
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:36,056
But the courier chief said the Prince
is not here

669
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:43,098
Sir, I feel I owe an apology to the Prince

670
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,489
He's inside

671
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:51,335
Wait, in case the Prince resists
and fights on

672
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:54,274
I'm afraid there'll be unnecessary
casualties

673
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:57,402
I've some drugs here

674
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,142
That's right, let's drug them first

675
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,877
And then...

676
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:10,358
Good, let's do it

677
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:12,690
I'm leaving

678
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,461
Goodbye, Master Bai Li

679
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:51,389
Prince, I apologiZe for being away
for so long

680
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,292
No need to stand on ceremonies

681
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:55,865
Master Bai Li...

682
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:58,770
He's gone, I'm afraid that he'll come in

683
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,036
so I've advised him to search
at the other inns

684
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:03,542
Thank you for your kindness

685
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:04,635
No problem

686
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:07,773
Prince, please...

687
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:09,918
Bring the wine

688
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:11,249
Yes

689
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,738
It's important that you should all
be careful

690
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,465
Yes

691
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,698
Prince, let's drink

692
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:05,631
Please

693
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:08,277
Prince, the wine is poisoned, don't drink

694
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:10,511
It's Han Chi

695
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:07,585
Tomorrow night, we'll be at Yeh Ha

696
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:11,392
but you are now dead

697
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:12,863
Prince

698
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:16,328
General Han, something happened
at Da Liang?

699
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:18,430
Yes, the princess is imprisoned

700
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:19,973
Sister

701
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,038
Lady Ping Yuan went to visit the princess

702
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,477
and found her out for the sake
of the Prince

703
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:27,606
She bore the guilt in stealing
the military tally

704
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:30,151
Being angry, His Highness imprisoned
the princess

705
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:33,881
& sent troops after the prince
to execute them both

706
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,015
Princess asked the Lady to convey

707
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,422
to the Prince that he has to take
extra care

708
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:39,460
and fulfil the wish of rescuing
the State of Chao

709
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:47,228
Sister

710
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:53,238
General Han

711
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,400
Yes

712
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,175
Go to Da Liang and pass on my message

713
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:00,941
Yes

714
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:04,345
Say that Wu Ji is grateful
for princess' favours

715
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,818
and is not able to repay her

716
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:15,054
The good news is

717
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,132
I can go to Yeh Ha without any obstacles

718
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:21,794
With the tally I can replace
Jin Bi to lead his troops

719
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:22,893
to rescue the State of Chao

720
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,640
Jin Bi guarded Yeh Ha for 1 0 years

721
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:29,836
Generals outside the capital
won't submit to orders

722
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:31,776
Just with half of the military tally

723
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:35,146
I can hardly hand over my 1 00,000 troops

724
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:37,615
How dare you disobey His Highness' order

725
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,621
and befriend Chin for our own safety!

726
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:44,489
His Highness asked me to come
all the way for

727
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,720
fear that you might follow
the Prince's order

728
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,797
when you see the tally

729
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:52,766
Naturally I won't listen to him, but...

730
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:59,073
Prince Shun Ling is honourable

731
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:03,043
It's hence even our troop leaders
support him

732
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:06,080
Unless, of course, they don't know
about this matter

733
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:08,013
Then...

734
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,179
General Chung

735
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:13,949
Yes

736
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,784
Lead your troops

737
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:19,383
and block the road from the camp to here

738
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:20,962
As soon as Prince Shun Ling is here

739
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,530
don't let any of our men come over

740
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:23,359
Yes

741
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:46,311
General Tung Guo, the prince is
digging his own grave

742
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:49,721
Yes, His Highness wants to
capture him alive

743
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:59,062
Your current plan

744
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:03,104
might injure him

745
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,070
and His Highness won't like this

746
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:08,405
Kill him & say he stole the military tally

747
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:09,569
with the intention to revolt

748
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:11,073
General

749
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,239
Prince Shun Ling is at
the inspection podium

750
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:15,879
That's quick

751
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:17,009
Please hurry

752
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:17,949
Yes

753
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:39,904
Prince

754
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:45,342
No formality, please

755
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,464
What brings you to Yeh Ha
at this late hour?

756
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:06,535
I'm here to lead the troops by
His Highness' order

757
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,204
Please hand over the tally

758
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:12,536
Such insolence

759
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,138
Prince, allow me to check the tally

760
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:21,913
You dare disobey an order?

761
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:22,779
Disobey order?

762
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:26,150
Guards

763
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,085
Prince, you are arrested

764
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,892
General, soldiers at the camp want to

765
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:23,089
go with the Prince to rescue
the State of Chao

766
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:25,063
and started a fight with those
who stopped them

767
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,896
There were serious casualties
on both sides

768
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,367
They are charging towards us

769
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,495
and are at the podium

770
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,201
Stop, Prince

771
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,306
Since the soldiers wish to go
with the Prince

772
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,937
I'm willing to hand over the tally

773
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:39,940
General

774
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:41,777
This is inevitable

775
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:46,552
But the soldiers cannot be appeased

776
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:48,247
Prince, please do something

777
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:53,520
We want to go with the Prince to
rescue the State...

778
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:55,221
Things will go out of hand

779
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:56,297
if they go on like this

780
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:06,841
Please match the tally and
pass down orders

781
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,910
in order that the soldiers will calm down

782
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:28,220
Please

783
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:38,904
Please

784
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:01,894
Stand still

785
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:05,756
Jin Bi, how dare you hurt the Prince

786
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,930
The soldiers' sentiment is turbulent

787
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:12,506
I have no other alternative
but to use Prince's head

788
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:14,072
Announce to the troops

789
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:14,835
Yes

790
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:18,174
The Prince is treacherous,
he will be executed on spot

791
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:18,939
Yes

792
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:23,249
Please

793
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:12,160
Prince

794
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:16,164
Prince

795
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:21,339
Wu Ji was to lead the troops to
rescue State of Chao

796
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:23,104
Jin Bi was executed because
he disobeyed orders

797
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:25,645
Do you generals have anything to say?

798
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,079
We'll follow the Prince to save
the State of Chao

799
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:30,678
Save the State of Chao...

800
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:32,481
You are here in time

801
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:36,017
I've begged His Highness

802
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:40,788
for granting me my own death
& have finally had it

803
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,824
Why do you have to do that?

804
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:48,063
Han Chi met my brother at Mong Yi

805
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:52,630
and is on the way to Yeh Ha,
he understands everything

806
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:55,141
Do you really have to die?

807
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,176
Yes

808
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:04,676
The Prince have stolen the military tally

809
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,617
and have committed serious crime

810
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,758
If I don't face justice

811
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:14,590
the Prince's honourable act
will be besmeared

812
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,994
I feel so ashamed

813
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:22,437
By the order of His Highness,
Lady will be executed

814
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,440
Yes

815
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,248
Madam, please retreat

816
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:10,084
To repay him for fulfilling her wish

817
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:29,259
But that also makes me frightened

818
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:45,583
Her name will live on in posterity
