1
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,200
给我乖乖待着
Stay down!

2
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,120
不准乱动
Don't move!

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,750
搞定
Yeah!

4
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,720
求救求救 这里是顽童二号
Mayday! Mayday! This is the Sawyer-Two.

5
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,180
我们遭遇海盗攻击
We're under attack by pirates.

6
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,640
请求即刻救援
Requesting an immediate aid.

7
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,730
大家总说每人各有特长
They say everybody's good at something.

8
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,150
而我 能与鱼类沟通
Me? I talk to fish.

9
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,320
我也因此结识好友暴风
That's how I met my friend, Storm.

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,070
我需要坐骑时它总会出现
He's always there when I need a lift.

11
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,920
有些人因此觉得我很搞笑 但我不在乎
Some people think that makes me a joke. But I don't care.

12
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,670
知道为什么吗? 因为我还有别的强项
You know why? 'Cause I'm also good at something else.

13
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,640
那就是擅长爆头
And that's breaking heads.

14
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,440
老爸单挑所有海盗
Pow! Papa took on all the pirates.

15
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,070
我说:"你们海盗以为..."
I was like, "Well, the pirates think that..."

16
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,110
你老爸打趴他们
Papa kicked their butts.

17
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,370
那些杂碎根本毫无胜算
Those chum lickers didn't stand a chance.

18
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,330
把他们打成满地找牙的猪头
Papa kicked their asses and took their names.

19
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,330
好耶 太棒了
Yeah! Come on!

20
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,130
小心
Watch out.

21
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,510
抱歉老爹 是我不对
Sorry, Pops. My bad.

22
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,680
对了 那是我儿子 小亚瑟
Oh, yeah, this is my son, Arthur Jr.

23
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,890
四年前 我的人生完全改变
See, four years ago, everything changed.

24
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,890
我遇见一位美女 坠入爱河
I met a woman, fell in love,

25
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,350
然后转眼间...
and the next thing I know,

26
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,980
我们已结婚生子
we're getting married and having a kid.

27
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,530
这个小家伙是我此生最棒的礼物
This little guy's the best thing that ever happened to me.

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
但这小子 他从不乖乖睡觉
But this kid, he doesn't sleep.

29
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,410
你尿布里面藏了什么?
What you got in there, huh?

30
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,370
好了...
Okay...

31
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,500
而且他总是命中目标
And he never misses.

32
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:53,960
搞什么...
What the...

33
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,040
所以我总是超早起床
And then, I'm up at the crack of dawn

34
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,880
因为除了结婚生子之外
because on top of getting married and having a kid...

35
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,420
我还终于找到一份工作
...I finally got a job.

36
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,680
没错
That's right.

37
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,300
在下正是亚特兰提斯之王
I'm the king of freaking Atlantis.

38
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,470
知道我是怎么坐上这位置的?
How did I score that, you asked?

39
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,150
我阻止我小弟欧姆攻击陆地世界
Well, I stopped my brother, Orm, from attacking the surface world.

40
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,150
在过程中 我剥夺了他的王位
And in doing so, I claimed the throne from him.

41
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,690
一开始我以为
At first I was all like...

42
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,240
好耶
Yeah!

43
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,320
领海的掌控权以前都是...
The territorial waters are long held...

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,530
然后我发现当国王其实没那么好玩
But then, as it turned out, being king wasn't all it was cracked up to be.

45
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,370
整天有开不完的政治会议
It's just meetings all day and politics.

46
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,500
快无聊死了 我都不知道对着盐海国王时
I'm so bored, I don't even know which end of the Brine King

47
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,170
眼睛该往哪看
I'm supposed to be looking at half the time.

48
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,960
好耶 真是太赞了
Yeah! That was awesome!

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,380
好像这还不够糟糕
And if that's not bad enough,

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,680
我更发现还有一个以前没人
turns out there's this whole Council of Houses thing

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,090
跟我提过的众议院
that nobody told me about.

52
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,640
他们有权否决所有我想做的事
Which basically gets to shoot down everything I want to do.

53
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,430
还好有我的小家伙作伴
The only thing that makes all the hard work

54
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,520
才不枉我那份苦差事和不眠夜
and sleepless nights worthwhile is hanging with my little man.

55
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,020
你没射中
Hey! You missed me!

56
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,110
当然这工作也有好玩的地方
But of course, there are fun parts of the job.

57
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,280
我得以用我的方式来维持海洋安全
I get to keep the sea safe the best way I know how.

58
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,920
特别是我还破获了几个非法铁笼格斗
Especially when I get to take down an illegal cage fight or two.

59
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,430
但不管我有多成功 还是会搞砸一些小事
But for everything I get right, something else gets screwed up.

60
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,060
喵的...
Ah, fu...

61
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,960
-好耶 -给你
- Oh, yeah. - Here you go.

62
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,270
他会需要手足来陪他玩
So... he's gonna need a little brother or sister to play with.

63
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,900
他有一只狗
He's got a dog.

64
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,030
我是认真的
Hey, I'm serious.

65
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,450
我亲眼看到你小时候有多寂寞
I saw how lonely it was for you growing up.

66
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,950
身为独生子
An only child.

67
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,870
我很遗憾没能给你更多手足
I always regretted I couldn't give you that.

68
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,090
别对自己太严苛
Yeah, well, don't be too hard on yourself.

69
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,460
结果我有个继弟 却是个混帐
Turns out I have a brother and he's a total dick bag.

70
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
别这样
Come on.

71
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,350
你跟欧姆的关系是特殊案例
Your relationship with Orm isn't how it usually is.

72
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:57,140
兄弟姐妹吵架很正常 但大家总归是家人
Sure, siblings bicker and fight... but at the end of the day, they're family.

73
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,190
必要时应该能指望他们帮忙
You should be able to count on them for help.

74
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,900
是喔 若要找帮手我还是宁愿选狗
Yeah, well, I'll still take the dog over him any day.

75
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,700
喂 你快看
Hey, look at that.

76
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,460
不是吧
Holy crap.

77
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,560
小宝贝 你是在跟鱼说话吗?
Hi, baby boy. Are you talking to the fishies?

78
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,190
天啊老爹 这太让我惊喜了
Oh, man. Pops, this is blowing my mind.

79
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,320
我这辈子都希望能跟人分享这天赋
My whole life I've wanted to share this gift with someone.

80
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,950
儿子 你和我 我们与众不同 我们很特别
Yeah, but you and me, son, we're different. We're special.

81
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,530
我们是陆地与海洋间的桥梁
We're connected to the land and the sea.

82
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,750
我等不及要介绍你认识 世上所有神奇生物
I can't wait to introduce you to all the majestic creatures on our planet.

83
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,540
让你知道这世界能有多棒
And show you how awesome this world can be.

84
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,710
对 你我一起
Yeah, you and me.

85
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,190
我交叉比对了沈博士的座标 结果一无所获
I cross-referenced the coordinates from Dr. Shin. Nothing.

86
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,730
还是没能在冰下找到亚特兰提斯遗迹
Still no sign of Atlantean remnants under the ice.

87
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,020
看来他又带我们白跑一趟了
Looks like he's led us on another wild goose chase.

88
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,300
只要我一天不修好动力装甲 海王就能多苟活一天
Every day I don't fix my power suit is another day Aquaman gets to live.

89
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,760
再查一次
Check again.

90
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,970
这次很接近了 我有预感
We're close this time. I can feel it.

91
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,110
探险日志第463日 史蒂芬沈博士录音
Expedition log day 463, Dr. Stephen Shin recording.

92
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,740
为了寻找亚特兰提斯 我走遍了全世界
My quest for Atlantis has brought me to the ends of the earth.

93
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,160
大卫凯恩逐渐失去耐心
David Kane is losing his patience.

94
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,290
若我不尽快找到他想要的 亚特兰提斯科技
If I don't turn up the Atlantean technology he's looking for soon,

95
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,790
他们大概会...
they're probably going to... um...

96
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,960
还是不提那个了 我相信一切都会顺利的
You know what, let's not even go there. I'm sure everything will be fine.

97
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,850
沈博士 快来看
Dr. Shin, take a look at this.

98
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,390
拜托告诉我你有线索了
Please tell me you found something.

99
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,730
地震仪上的读数超扯的
Seismic array is going crazy.

100
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,070
震央在哪?
Where's the epicenter?

101
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,400
就在我们脚下
We're standing on it.

102
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,550
快逃啊
Run!

103
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,560
发生什么事了 是地震吗?
What just happened? An earthquake?

104
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,730
不是 应该是一片冰盖脱落了
No. I think it was a piece of ice sheet breaking off.

105
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,980
快点 站起来
Come on. Get up.

106
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,230
-我的脚踝好像断了 -快点 我们走
- I think I broke my ankle! - Come on. Let's go!

107
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,570
快点起来 我们得走了
Come on, get up. Go, we gotta go! We gotta go!

108
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,700
快点 我们得离开 快点
Come on, we gotta move! Come on!

109
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,500
（发射讯号）

110
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,970
拜托 拜托 救我
Please, please. No, no!

111
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,590
救我 拜托 别放手
Help, please! Don't let go!

112
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,250
你发生什么事了?
What the hell happened to you?

113
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,800
那后面有恐怖的东西
There's something back there.

114
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,730
太神奇了
Astounding.

115
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,820
读数显示下面有东西
My readings show something's down here.

116
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,820
尺寸大到可能是亚特兰提斯船舰
And it's definitely big enough to be an Atlantean ship.

117
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,070
若真的是 就可能在上面 找到能修理你动力装甲的科技
If it is, we might be able to scavenge the tech you need to fix your suit.

118
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,450
这地方怎么可能真实存在?
How is this place even possible?

119
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,500
在地球持续升温前 这里应该被冰封了
This was all probably solid ice until we started heating the planet.

120
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,960
感谢温室效应 对吧?
Well, thank God for global warming, am I right?

121
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,960
那个 应该不算什么好事
Uh, yeah, that's not exactly a good thing.

122
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,520
足迹都往下走
The tracks lead down there.

123
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,360
穿上装备
Suit up.

124
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,450
等等 足迹都往下走
Wait. The tracks lead down there,

125
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,990
意思是怪兽也在下面
which means... the monster's down there.

126
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,750
好吧 我猜我们要下去
Okay. I guess we're going down there.

127
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,610
太不可思议了
I don't believe this.

128
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,070
这是某种建物
It's a structure of some kind.

129
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,240
冰里埋藏着更多东西
And there's more buried in the ice.

130
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,410
本来以为我们只会找到船舰
Here I thought we were just going to find a ship.

131
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,710
-所有人 散开搜寻 -收到
- Everyone, fan out and search. - Yes, sir.

132
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,670
我们侥幸撞见大发现了 博士
We've stumbled upon something big here, doc.

133
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,510
这肯定有几千年的历史
This has to be a few thousand years old.

134
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,260
太神奇了
Astounding.

135
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,000
这到底是什么地方?
What is this place?

136
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:06,500
终于 你找到这里了
At last, you are here.

137
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,490
将我从监禁中释放
Free me from my prison

138
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,500
我就会赐予你力量
and I will grant you the strength

139
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,170
好杀死谋害你父亲之人
to kill the man who murdered your father.

140
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,040
你不能这样丢下他
You can't leave him like this!

141
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,130
自己去跟大海求饶吧
You ask the sea for mercy.

142
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,550
快走 你得活下去 才能杀了那个混帐
Get out of here! You need to live so you can kill that son of a bitch!

143
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:59,050
你会夺回他剥夺你的一切
You will take from him what he stole from you.

144
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,980
让他的家园燃烧
His home will burn

145
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,020
让他的王国在我的军团前瓦解
and his kingdom will fall before my legions.

146
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,160
大卫 不要 大卫
David. No, David.

147
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,070
大卫
David! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

148
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,950
大卫 大卫 没事的
David. David, it's okay.

149
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,250
你没事
You're all right.

150
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell is that thing?

151
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,350
（五个月后）

152
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,850
世界各地传来惊人影像
...Just unbelievable footage coming in from all around the world.

153
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,850
各位观众晚安
Good evening, folks.

154
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,850
过去五个月来 世界各地
In the past five months, we've seen an extraordinary rise in temperatures

155
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,230
都传来破纪录的升温
reported around the world.

156
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,490
也因此导致许多前所未见的极端气候
And that has resulted in some of the wildest weather we've ever seen.

157
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,070
是的 在德州达拉斯发生了雷雪
Yes, this is thundersnow in Dallas, Texas.

158
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,120
能见度趋近零 今晚预计的降雪量
Visibility is near zero... and there's more snow expected tonight

159
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,210
会超过达拉斯往常全年总和
than Dallas usually sees in an entire year.

160
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,120
这仅是全球气候异象的一小部分
It's only one part of a worldwide weather phenomenon

161
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,000
完全是前所未见
unlike anything we've ever seen before.

162
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,590
亚瑟
Arthur.

163
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,260
议院召开紧急会议
The Council's called for an emergency gathering.

164
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,770
又爆发另一起瘟疫
There's been another plague outbreak.

165
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,560
连科学家都无法解释
...scientists are at a loss to explain.

166
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,520
但真正的问题是
But the real question is,

167
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,570
这还会持续多长时间? 气温最后又会有多热?
how long will it continue? And how much hotter is it going to get?

168
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,410
（亚特兰提斯议院）

169
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,070
这次是在哪里爆发?
Where did it hit this time?

170
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,120
亚特兰提斯的第九区
The Ninth Tride of Atlantis,

171
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,160
现在人鱼王国也传出疫情
and there are now reports of outbreaks in the Fishermen Kingdom as well.

172
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,960
已经好几世纪没有这样的疫情
There haven't been outbreaks like this in centuries.

173
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,040
为何会现在出现?
Why now?

174
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,300
海洋酸化、溶氧量降低、毒性藻华
Increased ocean acidity, decreased oxygen levels, toxic algal blooms.

175
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,220
原因任君选择
Take your pick.

176
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,010
陆地居民过去一世纪以来 不断戕害我们环境
The surface has been poisoning our atmosphere for over a century.

177
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,810
若他们不清楚我们的存在
You can't expect them to care about what happens to us

178
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,730
又怎能奢望他们关心我们的处境
if they don't even know we exist.

179
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,150
若我们想开始交涉协调
If you want to be a part of the conversation,

180
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,480
就得先站出来发声
we have to take our seat at the table.

181
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,740
是时候让亚特兰提斯 在陆地世界前现身了
It's time for Atlantis to reveal itself to the surface.

182
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,910
陛下应该很清楚议院对此举的看法
Your majesty is well aware of the Council's position on this.

183
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,170
听着 我们可以与人类科学家沟通 结合双方科技
Listen, we can talk to their scientists and combine our technologies

184
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,250
来扭转他们所造成的损害
to reverse the damage that they've already done.

185
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,510
我知道这有违我们传统 但这世界正逐渐缩小
And I know this is against our traditions, but the world is shrinking,

186
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,840
传统作法已无法保护我们
and the old ways aren't gonna protect us anymore.

187
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,760
时代已经改变
Times have changed.

188
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,140
亚特兰提斯渴望改变
Atlantis wants this.

189
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,020
许多新世代已不愿再躲藏
There's a whole generation out there that don't want to hide anymore.

190
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,350
你难道忘了正是这种瘟疫
Have you already forgotten that this plague

191
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,360
害死了你最敬爱的导师
killed your own beloved mentor,

192
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,900
你现在竟然会想与他们和谈?
and you want to negotiate with them?

193
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,410
我们赋予你小弟战争权 与海洋领主的称号不是没有原因的
We gave your brother war powers and made him Ocean Master for a reason.

194
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,120
若我们想让陆地居民知道我们的存在
If we ever decide to make ourselves known to the surface-dwellers,

195
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,170
会是为了歼灭他们 而不是共存
it will be to eradicate them, not to co-exist.

196
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,490
厉害吧
Hey, not bad.

197
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,240
我以前哄你睡觉得花两倍时间
Used to take me twice as long to get you to go to sleep.

198
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,080
真不知你是怎么办到的 老爸
I don't know how you did it, Pops.

199
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,250
梅拉与我有整个王国帮助
Mera and I have the whole kingdom helping us,

200
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,670
但这小家伙还是快把我们整死了
but that little baby boy is still kicking our asses.

201
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,080
而你
And you...

202
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,380
独自照顾我 扶养我长大
taking care of me, raising me on your own...

203
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,800
你才是真正的超级英雄
You're the real superhero.

204
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,310
敬单亲父母
To single parents.

205
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,440
毕竟我的工作没有你的那么高压
Well, my job was a little less stressful than yours.

206
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,150
是喔 但我这工作干得糟透了
Yeah, well, I just plain suck at my job.

207
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,490
武尔科嘱咐我要促进海洋与陆地团结
Vulko told me to bring the land and the sea together.

208
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,070
问题是亚特兰提斯 有半数人仍想摧毁陆地
The problem is half of Atlantis still wants to destroy the surface.

209
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,450
他们拒绝沟通 我什么也推动不了
They won't listen. I can't bring shit together.

210
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,580
武尔科相信你 是吧
Vulko believed in you. Aye.

211
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,960
我知道
I know.

212
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,500
我想念他
I miss him.

213
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,670
喂
Hey.

214
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,010
你无法拯救每一个人 儿子
You can't save them all, son.

215
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,350
你想知道我是怎么独自养大你的?
You really want to know how I raised you here by myself?

216
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,520
我只是埋头苦干
I just kept going.

217
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,610
事情顺利时欢庆 失败时则记取教训
You celebrate the wins, you mourn the losses.

218
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,650
隔天醒来继续加油
And you wake up the next day and you do it again.

219
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:07,320
有时最勇敢的举动就是永不放弃
Sometimes not giving up is the most heroic thing you can do.

220
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:34,520
（大西洋某处）

221
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,760
人体构造先天就不该去适应这种深度
Humans were not made to live at these depths.

222
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,550
别担心这点
Yeah, don't worry about that.

223
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,510
你只需记得这艘船是谁打造的
You just remember who built this ship.

224
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,810
我比较担心是他们多久前建的
I'm more worried about how long ago they built it.

225
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,150
已迫近目标 开启隐形模式
We're coming up on it. Engage stealth mode.

226
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,330
喂 博士
Hey, doc.

227
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,960
快去你那座大炮旁备战
You stand ready with that big gun of yours.

228
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,720
探险日志第613天
Expedition log, day 613.

229
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,310
凯恩踏上我们此行最危险的任务
Kane is off on our most dangerous mission yet.

230
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,150
一个三人的八爪机舰渗透小组
A three man octobot infiltration team.

231
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,480
我们寻获的这些远古机械太神奇了
It's incredible that these ancient machines we found

232
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,740
这么多年后仍运作如常
still function after all these years.

233
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,280
我仅为符合需求稍加改造
All I did was retrofit them to our needs.

234
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,120
但它们需要一种特殊燃料维持运转
But they require a very specialized fuel to keep them running.

235
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,740
凯恩称之为奥利哈钢
Kane calls it orichalcum.

236
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,580
我不知道他这些知识都是从哪学来的
I don't know how he knows about this,

237
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,290
但从他寻获三叉戟那日就是如此
but it all started the day he found that trident.

238
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,290
突然间他精通以前无从了解的秘辛
Suddenly, he knows secrets that he couldn't possibly know,

239
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,210
包括取得奥利哈钢的唯一管道
including the only way to obtain this orichalcum

240
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,300
就是要从那些高度警戒的贮存场掠夺
is to steal it from highly-protected storage vaults.

241
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,140
我们即将打劫其中最危险的一处
And we're about to hit the most dangerous one of them all.

242
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,640
好 你有15分钟的作业时间
Okay, you have 15 minutes to get in and out.

243
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,730
没有犯错的空间
No margin for error.

244
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,040
从这走应能让你直接抵达
Yeah, this should take you through.

245
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,680
我们不希望发生正面冲突
We don't want any confrontation.

246
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,260
大卫 我们无法对抗他们整个大军
David, we can't fight their entire army.

247
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,280
保持警戒
Stay vigilant.

248
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,410
我们不清楚他们有何种的防御机制
We have no idea what kind of security measures they have down there.

249
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,680
（奥利哈钢贮存场）

250
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,850
开始提取
Commencing extraction.

251
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,730
小心点 这东西易燃易爆
Be careful. It's highly volatile.

252
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,910
开始装载驳船
Loading barge now.

253
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,850
刺魟 改变计划
Stingray, change of plans.

254
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,600
我需要即刻协助撤离
I need an extraction now!

255
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,810
全体进入备战状态
All hands to battle stations.

256
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:50,120
（亚特兰提斯王国）

257
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,930
太神奇了
Astounding.

258
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,850
不明入侵船舰请注意
Attention, unidentified vessel.

259
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,560
-这里不是过境区域 -博士
- You are out of the transit zone. - Doctor,

260
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,150
快点开启音波电池充电
power up the sonic battery.

261
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,940
非法越境将遭受
Illegal border crossing will be met with

262
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,940
-致命武力打击 -现在

263
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,860
开始充电

267

充电率已设定为最大功率
Chargers set to maximum power.

268
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,720
（防护罩启动）

269
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,930
入侵者现身
Intruder in sight.

270
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,300
消灭他们
Take them out!

271
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,140
你们在等什么? 开火啊
What are you waiting for? Fire!

272
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,340
长官 亚特兰提斯敌军正在逼近
Sir, Atlantean hostiles are approaching.

273
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,140
分头行动 自行前往撤离点
Split up. Make your way to the extraction point.

274
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,260
收到
Roger.

275
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,390
他们抢了贮存场 我们不能让他们跑了
They've raided the storage vault. We can't let them get away.

276
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,270
别担心 他们跑不了 我来追击
Don't worry, they won't. I'm on this one.

277
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,660
暂停开火 他们在穿越夜市
Hold your fire! They're cutting through the Night Market.

278
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,660
小心路人安全
Watch out for the civilians.

279
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,010
警告 警告 非法进入超管区
Warning. Warning. Illegal entrance into hypertube.

280
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,720
超越600节最高限速
Exceeding maximum speed of 600 knots.

281
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,770
即刻减速
Reduce speed immediately.

282
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,820
惨了
Oh, shit.

283
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
大卫 我们已抵达撤离点
David, we're here at the extraction point.

284
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,040
奥利哈钢已到手并安好
The orichalcum is onboard and secure.

285
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,420
快点 我们走了
Come on, let's go!

286
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,500
不 还不行
Not yet!

287
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,800
我要先杀几个人鱼再走
I'm gonna kill me a dead mermaid.

288
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,560
离我老婆远点
Get away from my wife!

289
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,650
你老婆?
Your wife?

290
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,110
你先是夺走小弟的王位
First you steal your brother's throne,

291
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,030
然后连他女人都抢了?
then you steal his woman?

292
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,370
海王 你真可耻
Aquaman, shame on you.

293
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,960
大卫 我们得闪了
Uh, David, we gotta go.

294
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,040
整个亚特兰提斯大军正往这赶来
The entire Atlantean army is headed this way.

295
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
若我们不现在离开 就死定了
If we don't leave now, we're dead.

296
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,550
左舷20度
Twenty degrees port!

297
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,490
发射音波炮
Fire the sonic cannon!

298
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,320
快啊 老沈
Come on, Shin!

299
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,460
凯鲨夫人在高级议院召开紧急会议
Lady Karshon has called an emergency session of the High Council

300
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,680
以讨论剥夺王座行政权力的动议
to discuss a motion that would strip the throne of its executive power.

301
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,470
王座本该是亚特兰提斯的根本
The throne is the heart of Atlantis.

302
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,730
然而王座现在却经常空虚
Too often now it stands empty,

303
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,350
只因国王有一半时间在陆地游荡
while our king spends half his time on land.

304
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,520
现在他在陆地的仇家更尾随他回家
And now his surface world enemies have followed him home.

305
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:38,160
若亚特兰提斯在世人面前现身
This tragedy is merely a taste of the havoc that will be wrought,

306
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,910
这次的悲剧只会是冰山一角
if Atlantis ever becomes known to the surface.

307
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:45,450
因为若他连自己家人都保护不了
Because if he cannot protect his own family,

308
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,540
又如何能保护我们?
how is he supposed to protect us?

309
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,180
他跟之前不同 也更为强大
He's different now. He's stronger than before.

310
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,430
连不穿动力装甲都能跟我对打
And he can fight me without the power suit.

311
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,600
他那些新武器又是从哪来的?
And where the hell did he get all the new toys from?

312
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,430
那些科技看起来很古老 但我们从未见过
The technology seems ancient, but we've never seen anything like it.

313
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:11,610
他使用的武器射出某种超音波能量
That weapon he used fires some kind of ultrasonic energy

314
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,230
能干扰神经系统
that disrupts the nervous system.

315
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,780
我们知道被盗走什么吗?
Do we know what was stolen?

316
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,990
他带着大量的奥利哈钢库存潜逃了
He escaped with a large stockpile of orichalcum.

317
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,570
我该知道那是什么吗?
Am I supposed to know what that is?

318
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,830
奥利哈钢是远古时代使用的能量源
Orichalcum is a power source that was used in ancient times.

319
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,500
会排放大量的温室气体
It emits tremendous amounts of greenhouse gases

320
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,330
对地球造成重大伤害
that are highly destructive to our planet.

321
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,210
事实上 在我们察觉这点前
In fact, we almost destroyed the oceans ourselves

322
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,050
我们自己也差点毁了海洋
before we realized what we were doing.

323
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,550
这物质无法被安全处置 所以我们将剩余的库存
It can't be disposed of safely, so the remaining stockpile

324
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,220
分别埋在地底深处的12个贮存场中
has been buried in 12 storage vaults deep underground.

325
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,060
我们该警告其他的贮存场
We should warn the other places that are storing the stuff.

326
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,810
他早就打劫过了 库存全没了
He's already been there. It's all gone.

327
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:51,650
我们认为他过去五个月 一直在暗中袭击
We think he's been launching secret raids for at least five months.

328
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,230
只是这次不小心被抓到
This is just the time he got caught.

329
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,900
这波全球气温飙高 在陆地酿灾
Well, this spike in global temperatures that's causing disasters on the surface

330
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,160
并让陆地居民生病的灾情 也是五个月前开始的
and making the sea dwellers sick happened five months ago.

331
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,950
他用偷来的奥利哈钢来加速地球暖化
He's using the stolen orichalcum to heat the planet.

332
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,750
他为何要如此?
Why would he do that?

333
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,580
我不知道 但我会查个清楚
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

334
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,130
若他在用奥利哈钢加温地球
If he is using the orichalcum to heat the planet,

335
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,290
我们的时间就不多了
we don't have much time.

336
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,420
他已将此效应推越临界点
He is pushing this past the tipping point.

337
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:21,010
我们必须阻止他 不然全球气候崩盘迫在眉睫
He must be stopped or a global climate meltdown is imminent.

338
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,890
我们需要找到他 但他目前消失无踪
We need to find him, but he's completely vanished off the radar.

339
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,640
我想我知道有谁能帮助我们
I think I know someone who might be able to help us.

340
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,060
但你们肯定不会喜欢
But you're not gonna like it.

341
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,810
你小弟?
Your brother?

342
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,770
相信我 他是我最不愿意求援的对象
Believe me, he's the last person I wanna go begging for help,

343
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,690
但他以前跟黑蝠鲼交易过
but he's dealt with Manta in the past,

344
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,030
所以唯有他可能知道如何快速找到他
and he's the only one who might know how to find him in time.

345
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,200
人鱼王国不会让你见欧姆的
The Fishermen will never allow you to speak to Orm.

346
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,240
他杀死他们的国王
He killed their king.

347
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,410
我也没想去请求他们许可
I wasn't exactly gonna ask for permission.

348
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:51,870
亚瑟 亚特兰提斯 无法要求同盟国交出欧姆
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract Orm from an allied nation.

349
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,170
那等同于宣战
It would be an act of war.

350
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,210
不用亚特兰提斯出面
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

351
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,050
我会自己去把他劫出来
I'm gonna break him out myself.

352
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,010
亚瑟 凯鲨正想找借口剥夺你的战争权
Arthur, Karshon is looking for a reason to seize war powers.

353
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,720
若她真那么做 你的王位就只剩头衔
You will be nothing more than a figurehead if she does that.

354
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,520
我的主场本来就在外界 在那里我能做出真实贡献
My place is out there where I belong, where I'm actually good at what I do.

355
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,810
我厌倦了束手束脚的日子
I'm tired of nothing ever getting done.

356
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,060
我非得这么做不可
I've got to do this.

357
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,150
若被人发现 若你被抓到...
If anyone finds out, if you're caught...

358
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,400
那会分裂所有王国
it will tear the kingdoms apart.

359
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,990
那就帮我别被抓到
Then help me not get caught.

360
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,580
泽贝尔情报处最近查出你小弟
Xebelian intelligence has recently learned that your brother

361
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,790
被关押在陆地上的一处地下秘密基地
is being held on the surface in a secret one-of-a-kind underground facility.

362
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,380
他们以为海洋居民没有勇气横渡沙漠 
They're assuming no sea dweller would ever dare cross the desert.

363
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,710
（原沙漠王国监狱 今人鱼王国领地）

364
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,260
我替你准备了特殊服装
And here's a special outfit for you.

365
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,680
这算什么? 童装中号?
What is that, boy's extra medium?

366
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,050
这原本就是紧身衣
It's supposed to be tight.

367
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,930
色素细胞能改变颜色 维持隐身长达一分钟
The chromatophores change color and camouflage you for up to a minute,

368
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,520
让你能躲过大多数监测器
making you undetectable to most sensors.

369
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,810
攻他们一个措手不及
They'll never see you coming.

370
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,440
通讯部分要怎么处理?
What are we doing for comms?

371
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,190
开放式通讯风险太大
Open comms are too risky.

372
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,740
我会派一只头足类来充当你的传令兵
I'll be sending a cephalopod with you to act as a messenger.

373
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,740
那是一只章鱼
That's an octopus.

374
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,160
战术运筹与追击侦察专员
Tactical Operations and Pursuit Operative.

375
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,080
简称土拨
Topo, for short.

376
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,250
基因工程智力进化 用于渗透和间谍活动
Genetically engineered intelligence for infiltration and espionage.

377
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,630
它还会弹奏多种乐器
He also plays a variety of musical instruments.

378
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
等我们到了后记得保持低调 好吗?
Just try and lay low when we get in there, okay?

379
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,550
你或许是隐形的 但你的交接腕
You might be invisible, but your hectocotylus

380
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,220
开始闻起来像死鱼海底捞
is starting to smell like warm chum butter.

381
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,600
土拨 你这只笨鱿鱼
Topo, you dumb squid!

382
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,150
老天 拜托你
God, come on!

383
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,440
墨汁算是排泄物吗?
Is ink piss?

384
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,650
这座监狱由恐怖的沙漠王国残兵看守
The prison is guarded by fearsome Deserter remnants.

385
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,530
它们是撒哈拉沙漠化后 幸存下来的厌世苦行僧
Death-worshipping ascetics who survived when the Sahara went dry

386
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,330
以血液为生
by turning to blood for sustenance.

387
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,080
若它们捕获你 就会吸干你的血液
If they catch you, they'll bleed you dry.

388
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,500
你找到欧姆时 他会很虚弱
When you find Orm, he'll be weak.

389
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,250
它们会限制他的供水量
They're limiting his water supply...

390
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,420
维持他勉强存活
just enough to keep him alive.

391
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,680
等你见到欧姆时 告诉他我爱他
And if you do see Orm, you tell him that I love him.

392
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,310
告诉他我每天都想着他
You tell him that I think of him every day.

393
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,770
我会的
I will.

394
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,640
听着 我知道他是你们血亲
Look, I know he's family,

395
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,190
但别忘了他是什么人
but you can't forget who you're dealing with here.

396
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,940
一旦你把欧姆劫出来
Once you've broken Orm out,

397
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,520
就得时刻防备他从背后捅刀
you're not gonna be able to turn your back on him.

398
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,530
你需要他 但不能信任他
You need him, but you can never trust him.

399
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,220
你看起来真糟糕
You look rough.

400
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,140
见鬼了 你来这干嘛?
What the hell are you doing here?

401
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,180
我是来把你劫走的
I'm here to break you out.

402
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,470
你疯了吗?
Have you lost your mind?

403
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,890
是你害我被关进来的
You're the one who put me here.

404
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,390
干嘛一直翻旧帐 走吧 我们晚点再叙旧
Eh, why you bringing up old shit? We'll talk about it later.

405
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,360
你不能把我劫出去
You cannot break me out.

406
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,980
亚特兰提斯与人鱼王国间有协定
There's a treaty with the Fishermen Kingdom.

407
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,400
听着 我得阻止大卫凯恩毁灭世界
Look, I gotta stop David Kane from destroying the world.

408
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,160
只有你帮得了我 你自己评估一下
And you're the only one that can help me. So you do the math.

409
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:58,830
该死 来吧荒岛男 带上你的威尔森 该闪了
Oh, shit. Come on, Cast Away. Grab Wilson. Let's roll.

410
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,540
快点 我们走
Come on. Let's go.

411
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,050
这不代表我们扯平了
This changes nothing.

412
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,680
正合我意 小弟
Wouldn't have it any other way, little brother.

413
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,140
别叫我小弟
Do not call me "brother."

414
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,230
别这样
Come on.

415
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,490
快点 土拨 你这只笨鱿鱼 快醒来帮我们开门
Come on, Topo, you stupid squid! Wake up and open the door.

416
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,370
土拨?
Topo?

417
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,490
那只头足类?
The cephalopod?

418
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,450
相信我 那不是我的主意
Trust me, it wasn't my idea.

419
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,370
土拨
Topo!

420
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,760
好了 走吧
All right, come on.

421
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,150
等等
Wait.

422
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,780
你有...带水来吗?
Did you... bring water?

423
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,990
有啊
Yeah.

424
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,740
不对 不好意思
Uh, no, sorry.

425
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,410
我在路上喝光了
I drank it all on the way here.

426
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,620
-什么? -老弟 沙漠很热耶
- What? - Bro, it's hot up there.

427
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,680
你这只小虫
Ah, you monster!

428
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,270
喂 放轻松
Whoa! Easy.

429
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,530
-知道怎么骑这玩意吗? -你开什么玩笑
- You know how to ride one of these? - Are you kidding?

430
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,280
-我甚至不知道这是什么 -什么?
- I don't even know what the hell it is. - What?

431
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,120
好耶
Yeah!

432
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,420
好耶
Yeah!

433
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,320
好了 水岸就在那边
All right, the water's right there.

434
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,940
快去吧 纸片男
Let's go, skinny jeans.

435
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,100
对 就是这样
Yeah. All right.

436
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,180
干得好 小弟 来击掌
Good job, little brother. High-five.

437
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,810
才不要
No.

438
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,900
好吧 还是干得好
All right. Good job.

439
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,950
我在亚特兰提斯还有一堆 国王的公务要做 我们该走了
You know, I got a bunch of king shit to do back in Atlantis so we should go.

440
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,870
走了 土拨
Come on, Topo!

441
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,230
这比我想像中更糟糕
This is worse than I could have possibly imagined.

442
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,860
亚特兰提斯的安全和保障 是一种神圣的托付
The safety and security of Atlantis is a sacred trust.

443
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,360
过去一百世代 没有国王曾让国土遭受入侵
No king has allowed the great city wall to be breached in a hundred generations.

444
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,910
一百世代? 真的假的?
A hundred generations? Really?

445
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,200
那是多少年?
How many years is that?

446
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,830
我地质学不太好 算起来有一百万年吗?
I'm bad with geology. What is that, like, a million years?

447
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,290
还是你认为我是百万里挑一?
You're calling me one in a million?

448
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,670
这种时候你还有心情开玩笑?
How can you make jokes at a time like this?

449
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,460
国王乱开玩笑很有失尊严
It's undignified for a king to jest.

450
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,800
不好意思 尊贵的殿下 我只是爱用开玩笑
Oh, excuse me, Your Highness, if I use comedy

451
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,300
来掩饰自己的感情和纾解压力
to mask my feelings and deal with stress.

452
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,760
不这么做我就会变得像你一样 又紧绷又机车
Otherwise, I'd end up looking like you. A very tight butthole.

453
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:31,970
无敌龟毛
Super tight.

454
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,770
你知道 若担任领导的压力太大
You know, if the pressures of leadership are too stressful,

455
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,480
或许你应该退位 让更胜任的人成为国王
perhaps you should leave and let someone who knows what they're doing be king.

456
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,440
知道吗?
You know what?

457
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,440
等一切结束后 我等不及要送你回监狱了
I cannot wait to throw your ass back in prison when this is all over.

458
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,860
不用你送 等我们阻止了大卫凯恩
You won't have to. Once I stop David Kane,

459
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,320
我会自行向人鱼王国投案
I'll surrender myself to the Fishermen.

460
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,540
那是我对亚特兰提斯效忠的方式
That is my honor to Atlantis.

461
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,160
你真的很戏剧化
You're so dramatic.

462
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,500
随便你 只要帮我找到那混蛋就行
Whatever. Just help me find this asshole.

463
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,000
我的联系人会知道该从哪找起
Well, my contact will at least know where to look.

464
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:06,090
他到底发生什么事了?
What happened to him?

465
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:11,640
我认识的大卫凯恩只是行事不羁 却不是个疯子
David Kane that I knew was ruthless, but he wasn't insane.

466
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,350
现在这家伙却拿着枪 架上世界的脑袋并开枪
This guy just put a gun to the world's head and pulled the trigger.

467
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,390
甚至连条件都不先谈
Without even making any demands.

468
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,440
（远古奥利哈钢精炼厂）

469
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,790
恭喜你 沈博士
Congratulations, Dr. Shin.

470
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,290
你那音波炮的功效跟你说的一样强大
That cannon of yours worked exactly how you said it would.

471
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,840
东西是你找到的 我只是研究出该怎么用
Well, you found it. All I did was figure out how it worked.

472
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,340
我本来没想到会真的拿来轰人
I didn't think we'd ever actually have to use it on anyone.

473
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,800
这个嘛 怎么说呢?
Yeah, well, what can I say?

474
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:39,220
计划总是赶不上变化
Things don't always go as planned.

475
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,930
但那正是我所担心的
But that's what I'm afraid of.

476
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:47,110
大卫 这物质会重塑整个地球
David, this stuff could reshape the entire planet.

477
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,820
喂 博士
Hey, doc.

478
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:59,830
我们即将解锁人类史上最强大的力量
We are this close to unlocking the greatest power in human history.

479
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,290
别告诉我你真的想退出?
Are you really telling me you want to walk away now?

480
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,210
若我说是 你会放我走吗?
If I said yes, would you let me?

481
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,590
当然
Sure.

482
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,430
想知道你在丛林里能撑多久吗?
You want to see how long you last in that jungle?

483
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,100
欢迎去试
Be my guest.

484
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,030
算了 我还是留下来吧
Yeah, I'll stick around.

485
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,080
没错
Yeah.

486
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:56,760
欢迎来到最后边疆
Welcome to the last frontier.

487
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:01,720
他们从世界各地搜刮废弃船只 来建造此处
They scavenged ships from around the world to build this place.

488
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:04,060
人称沉没堡垒
The Sunken Citadel.

489
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:08,060
陆地与海洋界的败类 聚集在此处互相切磋
It is the one place in the world where the scum of the land and sea mingle.

490
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,610
人们更为了隐姓埋名而来到这里
It is where people come to disappear.

491
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,650
妈啊
Wow.

492
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,650
这个破山寨听起来真厉害
It's an impressive shithole.

493
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,950
为何我从未听说过这地方?
How have I never heard of this place before?

494
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:22,700
大家对此处避而不谈 这里是海盗的大本营
It is not meant to be common knowledge. It's a pirate haven.

495
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:24,700
海盗?
Pirates?

496
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,040
我不确定你是否知道这点
Listen, I don't know if you know this about me,

497
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,380
但海盗通常不太喜欢我
but I'm not too popular with pirates.

498
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,390
我非常清楚这点
Oh, I'm well aware.

499
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,850
放轻松 只有这样才能把我俩一起弄进去
Relax. It was the only way to get us both in.

500
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,940
你至少可以先警告我
You could've at least given me a heads up.

501
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,190
那样你会配合吗?
Would you have gone along with it?

502
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:59,490
-才不会 -那就闭嘴吧
- Hell, no. - Then put a hook in it.

503
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,900
在那里 那位就是王鱼
There. That's Kingfish.

504
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,070
当初就是它安排我和大卫凯恩接头的
He is the one who put me in contact with David Kane.

505
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:39,860
它专门替海盗、佣兵 和奴隶贩子担任白手套仲介
He brokers deals with pirates, mercenaries, slavers, you name it.

506
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,740
好酷
Cool.

507
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:42,740
我要去挑个事
I'm gonna go pick a fight.

508
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,370
交给我处理吧
Just let me handle this.

509
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,160
它是我们找到黑蝠鲼的最好机会
He's our best shot at finding Manta,

510
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,540
你若跑去它面前大秀肌肉
and he's not going to tell us anything if you go in there

511
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,330
它是什么都不会说的
flexing your muscles at him.

512
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,380
你很幸运我俩没有一起长大 小弟
You're so lucky we didn't grow up together, little brother.

513
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,920
别叫我小弟
Do not call me "brother."

514
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:01,880
唉唷唷
Well...

515
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:06,220
真是个大惊喜
This is a bit of a surprise, isn't it?

516
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,640
我没想到你已经被监狱释放了
I didn't realize you'd been released from prison.

517
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,560
我是最近才出狱的
It is a recent development.

518
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,690
反正我们都是亡命之徒 对吧?
Outlaws, aren't we all?

519
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,570
我们需要找到大卫凯恩
We need to find David Kane.

520
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,860
关于那点 恐怕我有坏消息
Bad news, I'm afraid.

521
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:26,490
大卫凯恩现在不接生意了
David Kane is no longer on the market.

522
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:29,040
多少钱都不接
Not for sale at any price.

523
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:34,120
他现在自己当老板 单打独斗
He's solely running as an independent operator.

524
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,210
他的藏身处在哪?
Where is he holed up now?

525
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,170
作为交换 我可以让
In exchange, I offer a favor...

526
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,800
亚特兰提斯之王欠你一次情
from the King of Atlantis.

527
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,810
你难不成真想让我跟那种
You seriously expect me to play footsie with someone

528
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,730
满手血腥的家伙打交道?
with that kind of blood on their hands?

529
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,230
可我没有手
I don't have hands!

530
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,020
也没有脚
Or feet!

531
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,530
听着 若是你提供的情报核实无误
Listen, if the information checks out good,

532
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:11,200
我保证我不会立刻回来拆了这地方
I promise you that I won't immediately come back here and tear this place apart.

533
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,120
那真是太可惜了
That's too bad.

534
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:22,090
道上规矩是亚特兰提斯之王 向来对沉没堡垒睁一只眼闭一只眼
Traditionally, the kings of Atlantis have turned a blind eye to the Sunken Citadel.

535
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,890
现在看来我们得手动替你闭眼了
Now, we have to blind it for you.

536
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,230
算了 你来大秀肌肉吧
Fine. Flex your muscles.

537
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,160
快打爆他的鸟头
Smash his stupid head in!

538
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,450
吃我一拳
Boom!

539
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,470
抓到你了 死胖子
Gotcha, fatback!

540
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,940
好啦好啦 万事好商量 我们聊聊
Okay! Okay! We can work this out. We can.

541
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,150
那你说啊
Talk.

542
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:21,190
我不知道他在哪 但最近有不少谣传
I don't know where he is, but there have been rumors.

543
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:25,400
南太平洋一个叫魔鬼深渊的休眠火山
A dormant volcano in the South Pacific, called "Devil's Deep."

544
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,360
再说快点
Talk faster.

545
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,950
那里曾经荒芜多年
It's been barren for years.

546
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,160
但旅人说最近当地出现丛林
But travelers say there's a jungle there now.

547
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,910
船只一旦靠近当地导航系统就会错乱
Navigation gets scrambled as soon as you start to get close.

548
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,910
若是太靠近 就会有去无回
And if you get too close, you don't come back!

549
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:39,960
若要我猜 而我真的是乱猜的
If I was a betting man, and believe me, I am,

550
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,590
我会说大卫凯恩藏在那里
I'd say that's where Kane is hiding out.

551
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,420
消息打听到了 我们走
We got all we needed. Let's go!

552
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,820
崛起 来吧 从火中崛起
♪ Rise up, come Rise up through the fire ♪

553
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,910
很快你就会比他更为强大
Soon you'll be more powerful than he is.

554
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:16,450
但你还没准备好 而且你太快让他入局了
But you're not ready yet, and you involved him far too soon.

555
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:19,250
我能感觉到他们的追兵
I sense them closing in on us.

556
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,670
我看起来很担心吗?
Do I seem concerned?

557
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,250
其实这样反而更方便
If anything, it's even easier now.

558
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,090
比我们原本自己计划得更...
We couldn't have planned it any better than...

559
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:41,310
嗨 我只是想告诉你奥利哈钢熔炉
Hey. I... I just wanted to tell you that the orichalcum furnace

560
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:43,230
现在正在以最大值输出
is now running at peak output.

561
00:56:55,830 --> 00:57:00,960
（南太平洋某处）

562
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:15,680
（魔鬼深渊）

563
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:36,910
我赢了
I win.

564
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,710
土拨 回亚特兰提斯通报我们的方位
Topo, go back to Atlantis and give them our coordinates.

565
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,390
你知道现在有什么会很棒吗?
You know what'd be amazing right now?

566
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:55,390
援兵?
Reinforcements?

567
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,350
超大又多汁的起司汉堡 再加上一大杯黑啤酒
Great, big, greasy cheeseburger and a pint of Guinness.

568
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,180
你得承认 陆地的食物真的好吃很多
You gotta admit, the food is so much better up here.

569
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,640
这种说法有点离谱
I find that hard to believe.

570
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,100
等等
Hold up.

571
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,190
你是说你从没为了起司汉堡上岸过?
You telling me you never went topside to have a cheeseburger?

572
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,780
-什么? -或是为了腊肠披萨?
- What? - Or a slice of 'za? Pepperoni?

573
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:14,610
或是为了超厚半生牛排 配上薯条和奶昔 再沾上...
Or a thick, juicy, medium raw steak with fries and a shake, and you dip it...

574
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:18,950
就连陆地居民食物的名称 听起来都很恶心
Even the words that surface-dwellers give their food sound disgusting.

575
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:23,580
因为偏见 你失去享受半个世界的乐趣
You've let your prejudices stop you from enjoying half the world.

576
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,380
你该好好反思 那是你的损失 兄弟
You should think about that. It's your loss, dude.

577
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,430
好耶
Aw, yeah!

578
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,850
我打赌你从没吃过这个
Bet you never had one of these.

579
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,560
-那是什么? -蟑螂
- What is it? - It's a cockroach.

580
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:43,520
你们会吃这个?
You eat it?

581
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,440
对啊 这等同陆地的鲜虾
Oh, yeah. Shrimp of the land.

582
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,960
对吧 很好吃 来 这个给你喝
Eh? That's good. Here, drink this.

583
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,380
好 你先请
Okay, you first.

584
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:45,250
你有看到这个吗?
Are you seeing this?

585
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,420
这不正常吗?
That's not normal?

586
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,760
肯定不正常
Definitely not normal. Ugh.

587
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:02,930
我们走吧 现在你知道奥利哈钢有多危险了
Let's get out of here. You see how dangerous the orichalcum can be?

588
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:06,060
我打赌那在短时间内 让岛上动植物都变异了
I bet it mutated the flora and fauna in a short amount of time,

589
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,770
变得超...巨大
turning them... monstrous.

590
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,070
糟糕
Oh, shit...

591
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,790
快逃啊
Run!

592
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,010
快点
Come on.

593
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:40,680
再跑快点
Faster!

594
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,770
你在耍什么宝?
What the hell are you doing?

595
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:50,850
我不知道 我不太习惯跑步
I don't know. I'm not used to running.

596
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:51,980
跟着我做
Just do what I do.

597
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,770
用手臂和腿 手刀摆动起来
Use your arms, use your legs. Lift them up.

598
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,440
像这样吗?
Like this?

599
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,860
-你不是吧 -好耶
- Holy shit. - Yeah!

600
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,280
-等等我 -好耶
- Wait up. - Yeah!

601
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,440
我们得跳下去 这高度摔不死
We have to jump. We'll survive the fall.

602
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,150
你疯了吗? 那会很痛
Are you crazy? It's gonna hurt.

603
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,940
不然你想怎样? 留在这里跟跳跳鬼打一架?
What do you wanna do, stay here and fight the hopping demons?

604
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:42,110
那是什么? 上面写什么?
What is that? What does that say?

605
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:43,700
那是古老的亚特兰提斯语
The writing is ancient Atlantean.

606
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,780
"真正的王者搭建桥梁"
"A true king builds bridges."

607
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,500
你想干嘛?
What are you doing?

608
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,510
你还有比这更瞎的主意吗?
Got any more krill-brained ideas?

609
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:30,370
你看 真正的王者搭建桥梁
See? A true king builds bridges.

610
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,210
那只是一种隐喻
That's a metaphor!

611
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,080
喔对 我忘记告诉你了
Hey! I forgot to tell you.

612
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,500
老妈说她很爱你
Mom says she loves you.

613
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,590
也总是想着你
She thinks about you all the time.

614
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,670
你干嘛挑现在告诉我?
Why the hell are you telling me this now?

615
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:45,340
我也不知道 懒得等待适当时机了
I don't know. I'm just tired of waiting for the right moment.

616
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:53,230
快点
Come on.

617
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,840
看来我的隐喻刚救了你一命
Looks like my metaphor just saved your ass.

618
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,770
大卫 我刚才做了更多测试 但这些数据很让人忧心
Uh, David? I just ran more tests, and this data is really disturbing.

619
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:39,690
我们得停止燃烧奥利哈钢
We have to stop burning the... orichalcum.

620
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,230
大卫?
David?

621
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:57,600
好吧 博士 既然你这么想知道我的大计
Okay, doc, you want to know my plan so bad.

622
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,020
那就告诉你吧
Here it is.

623
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:04,690
我要干掉海王 毁掉他所珍视的一切
I'm gonna kill Aquaman and destroy everything he holds dear.

624
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:11,160
我要杀光他的家人 将他的王国焚烧殆尽
I'm gonna murder his family and burn his kingdom to ash.

625
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,950
我会为我父亲报仇
I will avenge my father.

626
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,910
就算得跟魔鬼交易也没问题
Even if I have to make a deal with the devil to do it.

627
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:24,080
大卫 你不能信任那支三叉戟
David, you can't trust the trident.

628
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:34,550
我从不轻易拔出这把匕首 除非确定能见血
I never draw this blade unless it's gonna taste blood.

629
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:39,600
你最好祈祷我不会再对你拔刀
Pray I never show it to you again.

630
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,210
我们肯定接近放射源了
We must be getting close to the radiation source.

631
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:08,960
我们该先等亚特兰提斯 接到通报再行动
We should wait for Atlantis to receive your message.

632
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,760
目前可以先行侦察
We can conduct reconnaissance in the meantime.

633
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:13,760
好喔 洛基 没人在问你的意见
Yeah. Look, Loki, I'm not asking for your advice on this.

634
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,680
你已经完成你的阶段任务
You've already lived up to your end of the deal.

635
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,100
欢迎你随时返回阿兹卡班
So you can go on back to Azkaban for all I care.

636
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,640
那你有何计划?
So, what's your plan?

637
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:20,970
我没计划
I don't have one, yet.

638
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:24,060
但他攻击我妻子 所以我非搞死他不可
But he came after my wife, which means I'm gonna pull his tongue out of his butt.

639
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,270
亚瑟 你是国王 不可意气用事
Arthur, you are the king. You cannot let this get personal.

640
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,940
当初拿整个王国来赌气的人
This coming from the guy who turned the entire nation of Atlantis

641
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,610
也好意思这么说?
into his own private ego trip?

642
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:32,740
我赌气?
My ego?

643
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:35,990
是你自己先来踢馆挑战我的王位
You're the one who swam through the front gate and challenged my claim for the throne.

644
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:38,280
那只是因为你想毁灭陆地世界
Only because you're trying to destroy the surface world.

645
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,660
若你没有那么恶劣 现在还会是国王
If you weren't such an asshole, you'd still be king.

646
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:42,330
太扯了
Unbelievable.

647
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:43,750
等等 等等
Wait, wait! Wait!

648
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,330
你抢了我的王位却根本不想要?
You took my throne and you don't even want it?

649
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:49,040
你是在搞笑吧? 我恨死这工作了
Are you kidding me? I hate this job.

650
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,010
我这样做纯粹是为了 防止亚特兰提斯毁灭陆地世界
Only reason I'm doing it is to keep Atlantis from destroying the surface.

651
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,720
而且我很可能正越搞越糟
And I might even be screwing that up.

652
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,010
你真的无心王位?
You really had no ambition for it?

653
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:56,180
完全无意
Absolutely not.

654
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,850
从我父亲发现你存在的那天起
From the day my father found out you existed,

655
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,600
他就训练我做好准备
he prepared me for the moment that you would come

656
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,850
以防你有朝一日来篡位
and challenge me for the throne.

657
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:03,480
那也太可悲了
Wow, that's really sad.

658
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,980
特别是我那么容易就打趴你
Especially when you think how easily I kicked your ass

659
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,810
根本不需准备工作
with basically no prep time whatsoever.

660
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:09,150
打脸了
Roasted.

661
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:11,320
事情经过不是那样的
That is not how it happened.

662
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,940
-事情的经过正是如此 -是梅拉救了你
- That's exactly how it happened. - Mera saved you.

663
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:14,400
她才没有 是我自己打趴你
No, she didn't. I kicked your ass.

664
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,030
才怪 她操纵了水龙卷 我被卷入其中
Nope. She made the little water tornado. I fell in it.

665
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:18,490
闭嘴 我们应该到了
Okay, shut up. I think we're here.

666
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,170
来吧 我们上吧
Come on, let's do this.

667
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:32,760
等一切完事后 我们该去吃汉堡喝啤酒
Once this is over with, we should go get some burgers and beers.

668
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,840
-别得寸进尺 -塔可和龙舌兰酒
- Don't push it. - Tacos and tequila.

669
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,380
根本没听过那些东西
I don't even know those words.

670
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,700
喂
Hey!

671
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:40,110
等等 小弟
Whoa, brother.

672
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:52,380
那是奥利哈钢熔炉
It's an orichalcum furnace.

673
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:55,170
所有被偷走的奥利哈钢
All that stolen orichalcum.

674
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:56,920
就这样烧个不停
They're just burning it up.

675
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,920
他是故意要让大气升温
He's heating the atmosphere on purpose.

676
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,840
这真是大灾难
This is catastrophic.

677
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,930
这地方肯定有隔热罩
This whole place must be heat-shielded

678
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,310
好躲过地表热能卫星的侦测
to protect it from the surface's thermal satellites.

679
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:07,350
问题是 要怎么阻止?
Question is, how do we stop 'em?

680
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:10,520
要摧毁这些反应炉 我们必须夷平整座岛屿
To take out this reactor, we would have to crater the entire island.

681
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,600
离控制台远点
Get away from there! Now!

682
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:18,780
这把雷射枪可能很古老 却是专为杀死亚特兰提斯人而制成
This blaster may be ancient, but it was built for killing Atlanteans.

683
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,240
好 很抱歉 我不是那个意思
Okay, I am so sorry. I did not mean that.

684
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,830
我只是怕你们会在我投降前先打死我
I just didn't want you to break me in half before I could surrender.

685
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,710
求你们带我走
Please take me with you.

686
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,340
敲昏他 然后帮我把这些人藏起来
Knock him out and then help me hide these bodies.

687
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,340
不 等等 拜托
No, no. Wait, please.

688
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:40,670
这完全不是我的本意
I didn't want any of this.

689
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:43,890
我原本只是想亲眼目睹亚特兰提斯
All I wanted was to see Atlantis with my own eyes.

690
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:46,100
我以为可以跟世界分享这奇迹
I thought I could share its wonders with the world.

691
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:49,560
我是科学家 只想被认真对待
I'm a scientist, and I just wanted to be taken seriously.

692
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:53,310
大卫凯恩说他能帮我 但现在他不放我离开
David Kane said he could help me, but now he won't let me leave.

693
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:56,520
你指望我们相信你跟这一切无关?
You expect us to believe you have nothing to do with this?

694
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:58,690
我知道
I know.

695
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:00,780
我做了些很不光彩的事
I've done things I'm not proud of.

696
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,110
但若我不照办他就会杀了我
But he would've killed me if I hadn't.

697
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,120
敲昏他
Knock him out.

698
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,160
不要
No.

699
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,410
-那我来敲昏他 -不行
- Then I'll knock him out. - No!

700
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:12,790
-什么? -不行
- What? - No.

701
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:15,790
好啦
Fine!

702
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:18,050
你可以跟我们一起走
You can come with us.

703
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:19,880
谢谢你们
Oh... thank you.

704
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,880
但你最好从实招来 否则就会被我毒打
But you better start talking. Or I'm gonna give you one sasa!

705
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,260
好啦 好啦
Okay, okay.

706
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:27,970
是那支黑色三叉戟 它连结着某种上古邪灵
It's the black trident. It's a direct link to some ancient evil.

707
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:29,680
它赋予凯恩强大力量 作为回馈...
It gives Kane great powers and in return...

708
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,540
我讨厌被炸飞
I hate when that happens.

709
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:03,760
阻止他们
Stop them!

710
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,730
不不 别用奥利哈钢
No, no, no, no, no! Not the orichalcum!

711
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:20,980
你想炸飞我们吗?
You wanna blow us up?

712
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,770
-这东西会爆炸? -对
- This stuff blows up? - Yes!

713
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:23,810
不好意思
My bad!

714
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,240
那就别用它来打斗
Then stop using it!

715
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:31,490
闭嘴乖乖等我来救你
Just shut up and let me save your ass.

716
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,200
又一次
Again.

717
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:58,910
他要不穿动力装甲跟我们打?
He's going to fight us without the power suit?

718
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:00,740
我跟你说过他变强大了
I told you he's stronger now.

719
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:03,710
但他还是一个陆地居民
He's still just a surface-dweller.

720
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:13,380
小弟
Bro!

721
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:23,020
我从未想过会看到你俩并肩作战
I never expected to see you two fighting side by side.

722
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:25,390
我们是特地为你合体的
We're making a special exception just for you.

723
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:33,280
谁都不准揍我弟 除了我以外
No one hits my brother but me.

724
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:37,780
我原本打算最后再去杀你 但多谢你主动来访
I was gonna kill you last, but thanks for dropping by.

725
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,490
你让我省了好多麻烦
You're making this easy.

726
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:53,880
对
Yeah!

727
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:55,340
放马过来
Come at me,

728
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:56,680
杀手级国王组
the killer of kings.

729
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,860
夷平这座岛
Take that island down!

730
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:23,390
自由开火
Fire at will!

731
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:36,820
我们得尽快离开这里
We've got to get out of here.

732
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:50,330
故障 故障 警告 警告
Malfunction. Malfunction. Warning. Warning.

733
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,940
老沈 快点
Shin, let's go!

734
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,570
你还在等什么?
What are you waiting for?

735
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:26,530
快发射音波炮
Fire the goddamn cannon!

736
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:31,850
抱歉害你们卷入这一切
I'm sorry to drag you all into this.

737
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,440
但我们不能让人鱼王国知道 亚特兰提斯有介入
But the Fishermen can't think that Atlantis was involved.

738
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,770
泽贝尔的军队归我管 不归亚特兰提斯管
Atlantis does not command the armies of Xebel. I do.

739
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:41,280
我们盐海王国仍然记得你的恩情
And the Brine Kingdom has not forgotten its debt to you.

740
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,940
有事总是可以找我们相助
You may count on us always.

741
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,110
当我手握黑色三叉戟时
Something happened to me.

742
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,030
有奇怪的事发生在我身上
When I touched that black trident.

743
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,160
他为何在这里?
Why is he even here?

744
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,540
他该在返回监狱的路上
He should be on his way back to prison.

745
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:54,250
我们该听听他要说什么
We should hear what he has to say.

746
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:56,120
这种错我犯过一次
I made that mistake once.

747
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,290
所以我知道不该相信他
That's why I know he can't be trusted.

748
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:01,090
他还砍断我的螯足
And he cut off my claw.

749
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,340
花了一整年才长回来
This thing took a whole year to grow back.

750
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:06,800
听着 他跟我们一样想阻止黑蝠鲼
Look, he wants to stop Manta same as we do.

751
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,640
说句公道话
And just for the record,

752
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,850
多亏了他我们才能追查到这里
the only reason we made it this far is because of him.

753
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,520
我看到了失落王国
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

754
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:21,020
妈 我对这些事了解不够深
Mom, I don't know enough about this.

755
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,610
这有可能吗?
Is that even possible?

756
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:26,070
大家只确切知道 曾有第七个王国的存在
All anyone knows for sure is there once was a seventh kingdom

757
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:29,160
然后在大沉没前的某天
and then one day, just before the fall,

758
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,740
该国历史被从所有史书中抹去
every record of it was stricken from the chronicles.

759
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,950
你怎么知道你看到的就是失落王国?
How do you know what you saw was the Lost Kingdom?

760
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:37,960
大家甚至不知道它的国名
No one even knows what it was called anymore.

761
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,580
它叫涅库斯
It's called Necrus.

762
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:42,210
我不仅仅有看到
And I didn't just see it.

763
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:44,590
我还心知肚明
I knew it.

764
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:49,510
那感觉就像是回忆起往日
It's almost like I was... remembering it.

765
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:54,390
陌生的记忆突然涌入脑海
Flashes of someone else's memories.

766
01:20:55,270 --> 01:21:00,020
在亚特兰王在位期间 亚特兰提斯由七个联合王国组成
During King Atlan's time, there were seven united kingdoms of Atlantis.

767
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,320
而黑城就像是万恶的根源
And the Black City was a curse upon them all.

768
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,990
借由滥采奥利哈钢
By exploiting orichalcum,

769
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:17,250
涅库斯很快就成为超级强权
Necrus rapidly became a superpower unlike any other.

770
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,160
但这带来惨痛的代价
But it came at a terrible price.

771
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,580
污染陆地与海洋
Poisoning the land, the sea,

772
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:25,340
就连掌管涅库斯的暴君心智都被戕害
even the mind of the tyrant who ruled Necrus.

773
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:31,180
也就是亚特兰的亲弟弟寇达斯
Atlan's own brother, Kordax.

774
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:37,020
亚特兰央求他在造成 世界不可逆的损害前停止
Atlan pleaded with him to stop using it before the world was irrevocably damaged.

775
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,600
然而寇达斯却憎恨亚特兰
However, Kordax resented Atlan,

776
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,600
认为自己大哥只想窃取他的力量
thinking his own brother was trying to steal his power.

777
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:47,230
所以他求助黑魔法 并打造出邪恶法器
So, he resorted to dark magic and crafted an instrument of evil.

778
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:49,450
就是那黑色三叉戟
That black trident.

779
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:02,420
他将自己和子民幻化成怪兽
He transformed his people and himself into monsters...

780
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,920
好对抗亚特兰提斯
...to fight Atlantis.

781
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:10,300
两兄弟因此兵戎相见
So, the two brothers went to war.

782
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:24,520
但亚特兰击败了寇达斯 并用自己的鲜血施下魔咒
But Atlan defeated Kordax and imprisoned him and all of Necrus

783
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,480
好将他与涅库斯人民全数囚禁
with a spell cast with his own blood...

784
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:34,320
以确保寇达斯的黑魔法永远消失
...to ensure that Kordax's dark power would never be found.

785
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:38,700
涅库斯也因此被从史书中抹去
And that is why Necrus is stricken from the chronicles.

786
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:53,300
邪恶力量原本该永世被冰封
This evil was supposed to remain frozen for eternity.

787
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,680
但却被大卫凯恩寻获
But David Kane has found it.

788
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,930
那力量也逐渐掌控他
And it's slowly possessing him.

789
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:05,650
但即便冰帽融化 寇达斯仍无法重见天日
But even with the ice cap melting, Kordax still can't be freed.

790
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:08,360
亚特兰用鲜血魔咒 将寇达斯封锁在笼牢中
Atlan used blood magic to seal Kordax in his prison.

791
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,320
只有亚特兰才能释放他
Only Atlan himself could release him.

792
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:14,820
黑蝠鲼不需要亚特兰本人 只需要他的血
Manta doesn't need Atlan himself. Manta needs Atlan's blood.

793
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:17,280
血咒跟一般魔法不同 更像是DNA辨识
Blood magic isn't really magic, it's DNA.

794
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:22,200
想开启寇达斯的笼牢 就需要以皇室血亲鲜血为钥
The key to Kordax's prison is the royal bloodline itself.

795
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:26,170
意思是他需要你、我 或是亚瑟的血
That means he needs blood from either you, me or Arthur.

796
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:29,750
我们是王室最后血脉
We're the end of the bloodline.

797
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:35,220
不 我们不是
No, we're not.

798
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:39,100
原本世界各地就频传野火灾情
...Wildfires would have made headlines across the world,

799
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,390
现在更是几乎每周出现
but now, they're almost a weekly occurrence.

800
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:44,640
此刻全球正见证前所未有的气候异象
We're witnessing unprecedented weather events across the globe,

801
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:48,190
气象学家也不知该如何解释 全球气候的快速变迁
and meteorologists are at a loss to explain this rapid change in climate.

802
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,020
从炽热的热浪和干旱
From sweltering heatwaves and droughts,

803
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:53,530
不断打破高温记录 到暴雨和洪水
which are shattering temperature records, to torrential rains and floodings...

804
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:55,280
-到底怎么回事? -飓风席卷东岸
- What is going on? - ...hurricane bearing down on the East Coast,

805
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,370
让百万家庭面对断电...
leaving one million homes without power...

806
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:03,040
现在再加上我们一家
Make that a million and one.

807
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:05,710
我先去拿手电筒 小宝
I gotta get the flashlight, bubba.

808
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:26,770
我先留你活口 好让他能亲眼看你送命
I'm gonna leave you alive, so he can watch you die.

809
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,650
老爹
Dad!

810
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:38,360
-汤姆 -老爹
- Tom! - Dad!

811
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,660
汤姆
Tom!

812
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:43,410
不 老爹
No! Dad!

813
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:44,660
小亚瑟在哪?
Where's Junior?

814
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:48,960
汤姆 不
Tom! No!

815
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:50,880
抱歉 儿子
I'm sorry, son.

816
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,630
小亚瑟在哪?
Where's Junior?

817
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:56,220
黑蝠鲼...带走了小亚瑟
Manta... took Junior.

818
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,760
-不 -不
- No! - No!

819
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,220
不
No!

820
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:54,820
（发射座标）

821
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:56,150
（发射完毕）

822
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:59,070
医务兵已将他的情况稳定下来
The medics have stabilized his condition.

823
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:00,740
他不会有事
He will be okay.

824
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:02,280
我们刚收到讯号
We just picked up a signal.

825
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:06,830
很微弱 是从古老亚特兰提斯 声纳频率上传来的
It's faint, but it's broadcasting on an old Atlantean sonar frequency.

826
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:08,660
并往南极洲移动
Headed to Antarctica.

827
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:12,500
-去把小宝带回来 -我会的
- Bring our little one back. - I will.

828
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,340
我曾梦想过此刻
I've dreamed of this.

829
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,960
有朝一日你们俩能兄弟相挺
The two of you standing together as brothers.

830
01:26:22,890 --> 01:26:24,970
答应我你们会保护彼此
Promise me you will protect each other.

831
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:30,140
答应我 欧姆
Promise me, Orm.

832
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,700
去吧
Go.

833
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:13,890
好炫的出行工具 涅罗斯
Great waves, Nereus.

834
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:18,070
你的战舰很强大 但速度竟慢过海牛
Your warship is powerful, but it's slower than a sea cow.

835
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:23,490
依我看还不如甩掉这破烂 轻骑出行
I say we ditch all this dead weight and travel light. Hmm?

836
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:25,990
那敌方发射音波炮时要怎么办?
And what are you gonna do when he turns on that sonic cannon?

837
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:30,580
我们唯一的胜算 就是用全方位压倒性的火力回击
Our only chance is to hit him with total overwhelming force from every direction.

838
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:33,660
-不能让小亚瑟置身火线中 -我们还有什么选择?
- Not with Junior in the crossfire. - What choice do we have?

839
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:35,750
我们无法抵抗那种炮火
We have no defense against that cannon.

840
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,210
等等
Well, wait a minute.

841
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:41,090
这种武器会发射音波 并干扰神经系统 对吧?
So this cannon sends out soundwaves that messes with our nervous system, right?

842
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:44,050
没错 是超音波回波
That's right. Ultrasonic echoes.

843
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,680
若我们发射同样频率的
Well, what if we disrupt those echoes

844
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,550
另一种音波来干扰回波
with another soundwave on the same frequency,

845
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:49,720
而且还更大声呢?
but just much, much louder?

846
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,770
你想用魔法打败魔法?
You wanna disrupt their disruption?

847
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:53,850
那会是容易的部分
Well, that's gonna be the easy part.

848
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,980
拿上你们的武器
Take your weapons.

849
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,190
准备好座骑
And ready your steeds.

850
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,840
他是真的不喜欢你 对吧?
Really doesn't like you, does he?

851
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:55,830
我们原本进展不错 博士
We made a lot of progress, doc.

852
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,120
虽然他们在我们大功告成前毁了熔炉
They destroyed the furnace before we could finish the job,

853
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,000
但我们很接近了
but we were damn close.

854
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,630
只要再朝正确位置 射颗飞弹就能搞定一切
One well-placed missile should do the trick.

855
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:07,050
我的老天 我们做了什么?
My God, what did we do?

856
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,430
反正这世界原本已开了头
Nothing the world wasn't already doing.

857
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:13,180
我们不过是让进程加快了几年
All we did was fast forward things a few years.

858
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:16,680
冰帽还没完全融化 但我们扫描发现了一个弱点
The ice hasn't fully melted yet, but our scanning reveals a weak spot.

859
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:18,600
这里
Here.

860
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,230
从这里能让你直达寇达斯
This will lead you straight to Kordax.

861
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:24,730
开启音波炮
Power up the sonic cannon.

862
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,740
带上那小鬼 着装
Bag the child and suit up.

863
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,940
队长 前方有多位敌军来袭
Captain, we have multiple incoming hostiles.

864
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:01,730
（飞弹武装完成）

865
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,020
你们来得太迟了
You're too late.

866
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:13,820
等...
No.

867
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:40,980
开始充电
Commence charge.

868
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:34,240
你是开玩笑的吧
You've got to be kidding me.

869
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,030
太神奇了
Astounding.

870
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:18,660
（失落王国涅库斯）

871
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,950
这里太大了 可能藏在任何地方
This place is immense. It could be anywhere.

872
01:32:57,950 --> 01:33:00,530
涅库斯的王座位于城市的中心
The throne of Necrus is in the heart of the city.

873
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:02,910
-我感测到水中有东西 -所有人 点亮照明
- I sense something in the water. - Everyone, light it up.

874
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:12,800
你不是说寇达斯把他的人民 都变成怪兽军团了吗?
Didn't you say that Kordax turned his people into an army of monsters?

875
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,760
对 没错
Yes. I did.

876
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,220
眼睛睁大了
Keep your eyes open.

877
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,550
那很简单 反正我也闭不了眼
Well, that'll be easy. Mine don't close.

878
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:22,300
大家保持备战 前方有东西逼近
Everyone stand ready. Something's coming.

879
01:33:27,230 --> 01:33:28,770
自由开火
Fire at will!

880
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,700
我们得找方法离开此处
We need to find a way out of here.

881
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:47,540
从这里应该能一路穿过去
I think this goes all the way through.

882
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:50,040
我的军队能对付这些虾兵蟹将
My men and I can deal with these worms.

883
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:52,920
你快去吧 把王子救回来
Go now and save the prince.

884
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:55,050
谢谢你 殿下
Thank you, Your Highness.

885
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:59,510
来啊 你们这些软脚虾
Come on, you spineless worms!

886
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:01,430
放马过来
Bring it on!

887
01:35:10,370 --> 01:35:11,460
帮帮我
Help me!

888
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,400
把孩子给我
Give me the child.

889
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:14,080
你挑错日子良心发现了 博士
You picked the wrong day to grow a spine, doc.

890
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:19,210
快赶到吊闸后方
Get behind the portcullis!

891
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:22,210
我们需要关闭闸门
We need to close the gate!

892
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:02,630
离我儿子远点
Get away from my son!

893
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:06,670
反正用你的血也行
Your blood will do just fine.

894
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:10,880
你想要血? 就自己来取
You want blood? Come get it!

895
01:38:25,190 --> 01:38:26,650
海王
Aquaman!

896
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:18,790
你身穿我哥的盔甲 手拿他的三叉戟
You wear my brother's armor, and wield his trident,

897
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:21,710
但你连他的一半都比不上
but you're only half the man he was.

898
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,540
真可悲
How pathetic.

899
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:40,180
梅拉
Mera!

900
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:56,740
你先走
Go!

901
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:12,340
梅拉
Mera...

902
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:15,340
快逃
Run!

903
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:21,560
将我从监禁中释放
Free me from my prison,

904
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:26,900
我的所有力量就会为你所用
and all my power will be yours to wield as you desire.

905
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:07,480
杀了他 你就能再度成为海洋领主
Kill him, and you will be Ocean Master again!

906
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:17,860
不错 现在这样终于好一点了
Well, now this is certainly an improvement.

907
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:20,660
强大的亚特兰提斯身躯
Powerful, Atlantean body.

908
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:24,240
而且这个人比之前那个更恨你
And this one hates you more than the other one did.

909
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,830
你说谎 别这样 小弟 我知道你听得见我
It's not true. Come on, little brother. I know you're in there.

910
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:29,420
你看不出来吗? 你赢不了的
Don't you see? You can't win.

911
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:32,800
你不是杀死你弟 就是等着自己受死
Either you kill your brother or you die.

912
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:52,690
凭藉亚特兰的血脉 魔咒终被破解
By an Atlan's blood, this magic is broken.

913
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,210
我的永夜已结束
My eternal night is ending.

914
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:19,170
我受够跟你的傀儡对打了 寇达斯
I'm done fighting your puppets, Kordax.

915
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,260
我要跟你对干
I'm coming for you.

916
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:26,520
-给我 -不要
- Give it to me! - No!

917
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,930
-我能了结这一切 -别让他夺走一切
- I can end this. - Don't let him take it!

918
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:31,520
难道他抢走的还不够多吗?
Hasn't he taken enough already?

919
01:42:33,150 --> 01:42:34,440
放弃王位
Yield the throne.

920
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:37,990
是时候让我重新承启天命了
It's time for me to reclaim my destiny.

921
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:40,900
认为他能改变的想法实在太傻了
It would be foolish to think he could ever change.

922
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:42,490
我知道你会做到
I knew you would do this.

923
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:44,700
你才是独一无二的真正王者
You are the one true king.

924
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:48,250
亚特兰提斯值得拥有真正的王者
Atlantis deserves its one true king.

925
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:54,500
我才是独一无二的真正王者
I am the one true king!

926
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:05,390
你知道 我曾经有一度非常想见你
You know, there was a time when I wanted to meet you more than anything.

927
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:09,770
想让你知道你并不孤单 我俩能互相扶持
Let you know that you weren't alone, that we were in it together.

928
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:11,980
答应我 你俩会保护彼此
Promise me you'll protect each other.

929
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:20,860
来吧 小弟 让我们一起了结这个混蛋
Come on, little brother, let's end this bastard.

930
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,740
我俩第一次见面时 我说的都是真心话
I meant what I said when I first met you.

931
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,330
无论如何 你都不孤单
No matter what, you are not alone.

932
01:43:26,990 --> 01:43:28,290
我俩可以一起承担
We're in this together.

933
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:33,210
你是我的兄弟
You are my brother.

934
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:39,710
欧姆
Orm.

935
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,300
放手吧
Let go.

936
01:43:58,610 --> 01:44:00,530
欧姆 放手吧
Orm, let it go.

937
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:22,300
我终于重生了
I live again!

938
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:28,510
为了此刻 我在黑暗中苦等数世纪
I have waited countless centuries in the dark for this moment.

939
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:35,940
吃屎了
Shit.

940
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:44,860
亚瑟
Arthur!

941
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,700
绝不
Never.

942
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:23,590
亚瑟 我们得走了 魔咒已经崩解
Arthur, we've gotta go. The magic is broken.

943
01:46:38,770 --> 01:46:39,890
我们快闪吧
Let's get outta here!

944
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:53,490
快点
Hurry!

945
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,000
没错
That's right!

946
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,620
来吧 宝贝 好耶
Come on, baby! Yeah!

947
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,430
好耶
Yeah!

948
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:40,000
吾爱
My love.

949
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:44,080
嗨 儿子
Hi, baby boy.

950
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:54,590
老沈
Shin.

951
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:56,550
谢谢你
Thank you.

952
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:04,650
太神奇了
Astounding.

953
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:12,650
看来大家都全身而退 很好 很好
All here looking intact. That's good. That's good.

954
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:16,280
但我没有 我的螯足被砍断了
Well, I'm not. My claw got cut off.

955
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:17,660
还是第二次
Again!

956
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:21,080
你是最强悍的甲壳纲动物 殿下
You're one tough crustacean, Your Highness.

957
01:48:21,950 --> 01:48:24,330
依我来看 你的前罪已清
As far as I'm concerned, your debt is paid.

958
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:27,580
但不是所有人都会同意这点
Not everybody's gonna see it that way though.

959
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:34,930
真可惜你在战斗中不幸丧生了
It's too bad you went and had yourself killed back there.

960
01:48:36,970 --> 01:48:37,970
对
Yes.

961
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:39,850
这么多浮冰
All this ice.

962
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:43,020
要找到尸体可不容易
It'd be impossible to find the body.

963
01:48:44,770 --> 01:48:46,060
先低调一阵子
Just lay low for a while.

964
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,980
但别跑太远
But don't go too far.

965
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,400
我可能会需要你的辅佐
I may need to call you up for some advice.

966
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:53,360
像是如何管理王国那类的事
You know, with the whole running the kingdom thing.

967
01:48:59,410 --> 01:49:00,530
谢谢你
Thank you...

968
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:03,950
大哥
brother.

969
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:21,180
你比你自己想像中做得好多了
You're not as bad at this as you think.

970
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:25,770
亚特兰提斯的人民很幸运能够拥有你
The people of Atlantis are lucky to have you.

971
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,850
你弥补了我所有的不足
You are everything I was not.

972
01:49:28,850 --> 01:49:31,940
就算前景再困难 你仍能坚持正道
You do the right thing when doing the wrong thing is much easier.

973
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:37,860
你也愿意向往日宿敌开口求助
And you're willing to ask for help even from your worst enemy.

974
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:42,580
虽然有时你感觉不知道自己在做什么
I know it may not feel like you know what you're doing sometimes, but...

975
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:44,450
但请继续信任自己的直觉
keep trusting your instincts.

976
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:48,670
若你起身领导 亚特兰提斯必将跟随
If you lead, Atlantis will follow.

977
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:54,800
毕竟真正的王者会搭建桥梁
After all, a true king builds bridges, right?

978
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:58,050
我以为那只是个隐喻
I thought that was just a metaphor.

979
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:05,270
但你的隐喻刚刚拯救了全世界
Well, your metaphor might have just saved the world's ass.

980
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:30,750
刚刚传来即时新闻
We've got breaking news.

981
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:32,080
今日我们见证了历史
We are witnessing history.

982
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,550
其所带来的后果是...
A moment the ramifications of which simply...

983
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:35,590
无论如何强调都不为过
cannot be overstated.

984
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:39,680
海底王国
A first contact...

985
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:41,260
亚特兰提斯首度主动现身
...with the undersea nation of Atlantis.

986
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:45,510
一个隐身数千年的文明即将解密
An entire civilization hidden for thousands of years about to be revealed.

987
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:54,730
可以说世界从此将大为不同
I think it's safe to say the world will never be the same.

988
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:57,110
亚特兰提斯之王联系了联合国
The King of Atlantis has reached out to the United Nations

989
01:50:57,110 --> 01:50:59,190
正式请求成为会员国
and will be officially seeking membership.

990
01:50:59,190 --> 01:51:02,410
并有望提出共同努力方案 来扭转气候问题
And is expected to propose a joint effort to reverse the climate issues.

991
01:51:02,410 --> 01:51:05,660
据说这是与联合国在历经数周
We are told that this was the result of weeks of secret negotiations

992
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:08,620
-密谈后的结果 -本台将与艾力斯岛连线
- with the United Nations. - We now go live to Ellis Island,

993
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,620
直播亚特兰提斯的首位官方大使
where the first official ambassador from Atlantis

994
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:12,670
在联合国所发表的谈话
is about to address the United Nations.

995
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,760
今天我身为两个世界的代表来此
I come here today as a representative of two worlds.

996
01:51:25,390 --> 01:51:27,810
陆地与海洋
The land and the sea.

997
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:35,690
我来到这里证明了两地都将迎来改变
And I stand here as proof that change is coming to both.

998
01:51:36,150 --> 01:51:40,280
为应对全球危机我呼吁全球合作
And I'm calling for global unity for a global crisis.

999
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:45,490
好推进两地之间的和谐 以及我们世界的自然平衡
To finally bring harmony between us and the natural balance of our world.

1000
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:50,910
亚特兰提斯随时准备提供协助 贡献我方的科学与技术
Atlantis stands ready to help contribute its science and technology.

1001
01:51:50,910 --> 01:51:54,420
凭藉你们对大气的了解 以及我们对海洋的了解
And with your knowledge of the air, and our knowledge of the seas,

1002
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:57,040
我们可以一起写下彼此故事的下一章
together we can write the next chapter in our story,

1003
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,210
而不是结局
rather than its ending.

1004
01:52:00,210 --> 01:52:03,260
有时我们的分歧会看似太过极端
Sometimes it's gonna seem like our differences are too extreme,

1005
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,930
但我们只需要扪心自问
but all we have to do is look beneath the surface,

1006
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:11,180
并了解到我们同在此星球上 更有着相同的目标和远景
to see that we're all here on this planet with the same goals and aspirations.

1007
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:12,980
-即便两方的风俗 -给你
- Even when our customs... - Here you go.

1008
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:15,560
-是如此迥异与陌生 -啤酒与起司汉堡
- ...might seem strange and unfamiliar. - Beer and a cheeseburger.

1009
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:17,650
像你要求的那样额外多汁
Extra greasy like you asked for.

1010
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:21,900
但透过克服我们的偏见
And by overcoming our prejudices,

1011
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:24,490
我们会变得更加强大 并更为了解我们自己
we'll become stronger and learn more about ourselves.

1012
01:52:25,610 --> 01:52:28,990
我们可以抓住此契机 为了我们的孩子与家庭
We can seize this moment to create a better more hopeful future,

1013
01:52:29,370 --> 01:52:32,450
创造更美好并更有希望的未来
for our children, and our families.

1014
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:35,960
我的名字是亚瑟库瑞
