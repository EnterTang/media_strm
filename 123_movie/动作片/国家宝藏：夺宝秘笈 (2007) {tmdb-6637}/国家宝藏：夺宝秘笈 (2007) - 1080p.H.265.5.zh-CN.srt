00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,630
{\fs30}国家宝藏2：夺宝秘笈

2
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,130
华盛顿  1865年4月14日

3
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,530
南北战争结束后第五天

4
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,790
他在里面
{\fs10}He's in the other room.

5
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,400
- 你是托马斯・盖茨？ - 对
{\fs10}- Are you Thomas Gates？ - Yes.

6
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,270
有些东西想让你看看
{\fs10}We got something that we'd like you to take a look at.

7
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,640
听说你很会解谜
{\fs10}I hear you're quite good with puzzles and riddles.

8
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,510
- 是条加密的信息 - 这是普莱费厄密码
{\fs10}- It's a coded message. - It's a Playfair cipher.

9
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,520
- 普莱费厄密码？ - 你能解码吗？
{\fs10}- Playfair cipher？ - Can you decode it？

10
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,080
解那种密码得要有密钥
{\fs10}Cipher's impossible to decode without the key.

11
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,320
- 密钥是什么意思？ - 一个关键字句
{\fs10}- What do you mean by "a key"？ - A keyword or phrase.

12
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,760
我相信你需要东西的就在这里
{\fs10}I believe what you need is right there.

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,760
凡人皆要还之债！

14
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,820
这得花点时间
{\fs10}It'll take some time.

15
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,900
走吧，我拿日记，待会再跟你会合
{\fs10}Go on. I'll take your diary. I'll meet up with you later.

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,590
只要算好距离，保准你能正中靶心{\fs12}(舞台上正表演《我们的美国表弟》)
{\fs10}…calculate the distance and you're sure to hit the mark

17
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,930
这样不仅打手枪很准，打炮也很准哦
{\fs10}in about most things as well as shootin'.

18
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,810
…我要将它浇你身，就像狗头浇上粪
{\fs10}…ready to pour out all over you like apple sass over roast pork.

19
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,120
我得当心点，不能把手上的东西 泼到可怜的德・布茨老爷身上
{\fs10}I'll take care not to give up my hold on poor De Boots

20
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,750
要泼也得等了解美国人之后再泼
{\fs10}till I am quite sure of the American.

21
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,590
嗯，我女儿真乖
{\fs10}Ah, that's my own girl.

22
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,560
奥古斯塔，亲爱的，去你房间怎么样
{\fs10}Augusta, dear, to your room.

23
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,000
展示一下你的内在美吧，我的好姑娘 特别是那片幽深的草场，令人心荡漾
{\fs10}…to turn you inside out, old gal, you sockdologizing old man-trap.

24
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,680
【拉丁语】打倒专制君主！
{\fs10}Sic semper tyrannis！

25
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,860
神殿…
{\fs10}Temples.

26
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,730
黄金…
{\fs10}Gold.

27
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,270
锡沃拉？这是张藏宝图！
{\fs10}Cibola？ This is a treasure map.

28
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,100
KGC？你是金环骑士会成员！叛国贼！
{\fs10}KGC？ You're Knights of the Golden Circle. You're a traitor.

29
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,200
你们都是叛国贼
{\fs10}You're all traitors.

30
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,980
- 林肯总统被刺了！ - 出去！全都出去！
{\fs10}- President Lincoln's been shot！ - Everybody, out！ All of you！

31
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,990
杀手仍然在逃
{\fs10}Killer's on the loose！

32
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,480
马上破译密文，本人感激不尽
{\fs10}I'd much appreciate it if you'd finish deciphering that code now.

33
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,430
- 爸爸！ - 战争结束了！
{\fs10}- Dad！ - The war is over.

34
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,800
不！
{\fs10}No！

35
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,670
- 不要 - 别
{\fs10}- No！ - No！

36
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,750
你错了
{\fs10}You're wrong about that.

37
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,450
战争才刚开始
{\fs10}The war has only just begun！

38
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,630
查尔斯，“凡人皆要还之债…”
{\fs10}Charles. The debt that all men… men pay.

39
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,500
凡人皆要还之…
{\fs10}The debt that all men p…

40
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,860
爸！不要死！
{\fs10}Dad！ No, please！

41
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,210
别死，这不公平
{\fs10}Come back. It's not fair.

42
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,480
救命！来人，救命啊！
{\fs10}Help！ Somebody help, please！

43
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,970
所以，我在此重述
{\fs10}So recapping:

44
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,080
金环骑士会是一个南方的极端团体
{\fs10}The Knights of the Golden Circle was a Southern extremist group,

45
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,280
他们在北方活动，暗中破坏联邦政府
{\fs10}operating in the north to subvert Union forces.

46
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,920
如果那几页著名的布斯日记没被托马斯烧毁
{\fs10}Had Thomas not burned the legendary missing pages from the Booth diary,

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,930
杀手可能早已找到大批黄金宝藏
{\fs10}the killers may have found a vast treasure of gold,

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,940
而联邦政府也可能输掉南北战争
{\fs10}and the Union may well have lost the Civil War.

49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,370
谢谢大家
{\fs10}Thank you.

50
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,610
感谢本和帕特里克・盖茨两位…
{\fs10}I'd like to thank Ben and Patrick Gates.

51
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,670
谢谢
{\fs10}Thank you.

52
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,010
为我们讲述了一个精彩绝伦的传奇 以及托马斯・盖茨这位平民英雄
{\fs10}And say what a wonderful addition Thomas Gates is to our civilian heroes exhibit.

53
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,070
谢谢大家
{\fs10}Thank you.

54
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,550
谢谢，尼克尔斯博士，我只希望我爷爷
{\fs10}Thank you, Dr. Nichols. I only wish my grandfather

55
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,850
今天也能到场参与盛会
{\fs10}had been here to see this wonderful day.

56
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,450
抱歉，我有个问题想问
{\fs10}Excuse me. I have a question I'd like to ask.

57
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,330
你认为那页被焚毁的布斯日记上…
{\fs10}What do you think happened to that Booth diary page

58
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,300
- 究竟写了什么呢？ - 可能永远没法知道了
{\fs10}- that was pulled out of the fire？ - We may never know.

59
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,800
可能没办法
{\fs10}Perhaps.

60
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,530
也可能有办法
{\fs10}Perhaps not.

61
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,370
和你们一样，我的家族里也有位曾曾祖父
{\fs10}You see, I have one of those great-great-granddaddies, like you,

62
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,240
他名叫塞拉斯・威尔金森
{\fs10}way up in my family tree, name of Silas Wilkinson.

63
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,240
他曾说过一个林肯被刺当晚的故事
{\fs10}He used to tell a story about the night Lincoln was shot.

64
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,280
依他的说法
{\fs10}As Silas tells it,

65
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,590
布斯当晚并没有找托马斯・盖茨 谈什么藏宝图的事
{\fs10}Booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates regarding the treasure map that night.

66
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,450
是托马斯召集聚会
{\fs10}It was Thomas who called the meeting.

67
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,430
计划暗杀林肯
{\fs10}A meeting to plan the assassination of Lincoln.

68
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,990
- 太荒谬了 - 你说谎！
{\fs10}- How absurd. - That's a lie！

69
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,240
女士们先生们，请看…
{\fs10}Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you…

70
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,430
这张纸就是约翰・布斯日记中遗失的一页
{\fs10}…one of the missing pages from the infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth

71
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,210
上面有托马斯・盖茨的名字 和其他凶手的名字在一起
{\fs10}with the name Thomas Gates written on a list along with all the other killers.

72
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,810
- 这是拉丁文？ - 布斯曾学过拉丁文
{\fs10}- And Latin？ - Booth was a student of Latin.

73
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,080
他射杀林肯后大喊 “Sic semper tyrannis”
{\fs10}He shouted, "Sic semper tyrannis" after he shot Lincoln.

74
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,680
- 打倒… - 打倒专制君主，我们知道
{\fs10}- "Thus always to… " - "Thus always to tyrants. " We know.

75
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,390
- 萨拉特，copiae？ - copiae意思是军需供应
{\fs10}- "Surratt, copiae"？ - Military supplies.

76
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,800
玛丽・萨拉特被控有罪并处以绞刑
{\fs10}Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged

77
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,770
罪名是为布斯提供步枪和瞄准镜
{\fs10}for supplying Booth with a rifle and field glasses.

78
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,810
- 托马斯・盖茨，artifex - 意思是设计师
{\fs10}- "Thomas Gates, artifex. " - "Designer"

79
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,250
- 或者说策划者 - 我知道这字的意思
{\fs10}- or "mastermind. " - I know what it means.

80
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,580
一定是他策划暗杀的
{\fs10}He must have, uh, planned the assassination.

81
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,650
- 我明白了 - 也可能是策划别的事情
{\fs10}- I see. - Could mean mastermind of anything.

82
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,350
你看见没有？后面的内容被烧掉了
{\fs10}You see that？ Burned out right there.

83
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,030
我知道，对你而言这事情很难接受
{\fs10}I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you.

84
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,900
- 请问，这位先生… - 威尔金森
{\fs10}- May I, Mr？ - Wilkinson.

85
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,660
我来看看这页纸和布斯日记是否吻合
{\fs10}I'll see if this new page matches the Booth diary.

86
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,900
这简直是侮辱，你说我的祖父是个骗子
{\fs10}This is an outrage. You're calling my grandfather a liar.

87
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,530
你的意思是，我的曾曾祖父是个骗子
{\fs10}With respect, now you're calling my great-great-granddaddy a liar.

88
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,810
没错，我就是这个意思 我所说的不是从什么历史书里查来的垃圾
{\fs10}Yes, sir, I am. This isn't some garbage from a history book.

89
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,250
而是我祖父亲口告诉我的
{\fs10}My grandfather told me this story himself.

90
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,750
- 他的眼睛告诉我那些都是真话 - 我很遗憾，先生，真的很遗憾
{\fs10}- I saw the truth of it in his eyes. - I'm sorry, sir. I truly am.

91
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,620
这纸还得接受全面检测，然后才能做定论
{\fs10}We'll test this thoroughly, Patrick, to authenticate it.

92
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,670
怎么可能…
{\fs10}It can't be.

93
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,870
总统府的地图
{\fs10}Maps to presidents' houses.

94
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,440
有钥匙却没有要开的锁
{\fs10}Keys to locks that don't exist.

95
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,640
这是为什么呢？我究竟在找什么？
{\fs10}What's the point？ What am I looking for？

96
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,180
证据，证据，证据…
{\fs10}Proof, proof, proof.

97
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,020
什么证据呢？
{\fs10}What proof？

98
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,520
圣殿宝藏，作者 莱利・普尔

99
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,300
这本书是讲圣殿骑士宝藏的吗？
{\fs10}Oh, wow. Is this a book about the Templar treasure？

100
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,910
对，里面有讲到圣殿骑士的宝藏 但也有说到其它很多事
{\fs10}Yes, it is about the Templar treasure, but it's also about other things.

101
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,480
阴谋理论，民间传说… 及其它一些已被证实的神话
{\fs10}Conspiracy theories, urban legends and other myths that are true.

102
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,010
- 作者是不是在这儿签名售书啊？ - 作者就是在下
{\fs10}- So the author's here signing copies？ - I'm the author.

103
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,490
- 你就是？ - 嗯，你看
{\fs10}- You are？ - Yeah. See, uh…

104
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,260
那里面有我的照片
{\fs10}There's a picture of me right there.

105
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,060
我认为那张拍的相当不错
{\fs10}I think it's a pretty good picture.

106
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,430
我听说宝藏是那个 叫本杰明・盖茨的人发现的
{\fs10}I thought that guy, Benjamin Gates, found the treasure.

107
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,370
是本发现的没错，但我是他的搭档
{\fs10}Well, yes, Ben did, but I am the co-finder.

108
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,500
从没听说过
{\fs10}- Oh, I've never heard of you. - Oh！

109
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,280
我的天，你就是本・盖茨？
{\fs10}Oh, my gosh. Are you Ben Gates？

110
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,180
- 是的，我就是 - 你是不是有辆红色法拉利？
{\fs10}- Yes. Yes, I am. - Do you own a red Ferrari？

111
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,420
- 对，我有 - 嗯，它要被拖走了
{\fs10}- Yes, I do. - Well, it's being towed.

112
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,070
等等，那是我的车
{\fs10}Wait！ Wait！ That's my car！

113
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,240
你的法拉利呢？
{\fs10}Where's the Ferrari？

114
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,650
- 被国税局没收了 - 国税局？
{\fs10}- IRS impounded it. - The IRS？

115
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,320
说来滑稽，我的会计帮我
{\fs10}Funny story. My accountant set up a corporation

116
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,590
在一个虚构的岛上设立了一家公司
{\fs10}on an island that didn't exist

117
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,690
还告诉我富人们都是这么干的
{\fs10}and assured me that that's how rich people do it.

118
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,400
后来么，就有人来查我的账 还罚了一大笔钱，外加利息
{\fs10}Then I got audited and slapped with a huge fine plus interest.

119
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,360
知道五百万元要交多少税吗？
{\fs10}Wanna know what taxes are on five million dollars？

120
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,740
要交六百万元
{\fs10}Six million dollars.

121
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,600
我说完了
{\fs10}But enough about me.

122
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,040
你最近怎么样？
{\fs10}What's new with you？

123
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,980
女朋友把我赶出来了，我目前和我爸一起住
{\fs10}Well, my girlfriend kicked me out, I'm living with my dad,

124
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,180
- 还有我的祖辈刺杀了林肯总统 - 不错
{\fs10}- my family killed President Lincoln. - All right.

125
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,090
我要你帮忙
{\fs10}I need your help.

126
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,390
不敢相信你竟然连自己家都要用闯的
{\fs10}I can't believe you have to break into your own house.

127
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,160
我得拿到阿比盖尔的工作证 这样就能查阅布斯的日记了
{\fs10}I need to get Abigail's ID. She has access to the Booth diary page.

128
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,360
为什么不直接找阿比盖尔帮忙？
{\fs10}Why don't you ask Abigail for her help？

129
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,840
她把安防密码都改了，莱利 她现在连话都不想和我说
{\fs10}She changed the alarm code, Riley. She's not going to talk to me.

130
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,960
好吧
{\fs10}All right.

131
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,500
我们有30秒时间来解除警报
{\fs10}We have 30 seconds after the alert starts to disable the alarm.

132
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,980
开始
{\fs10}Go.

133
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,780
或许我不该问，但你和她究竟怎么了？
{\fs10}I'll probably regret asking this, but what happened with you and Abigail？

134
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,620
我不知道…她最近总是说“那么”这个词
{\fs10}I don't know. I don't know. She started using the word "so" a lot.

135
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,090
“那么”？
{\fs10}"So？"

136
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,220
比如说“那么我的意见无关紧要咯”
{\fs10}Yeah, like, "So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter. "

137
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,200
“那么说你总比我高明咯” “那么我是形同虚设的咯”
{\fs10}"So, you seem to always know what's best. " "So, I guess I'm invisible. "

138
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,030
我已经从这儿搬走了，正在协商怎么分家具
{\fs10}Now I've moved out, we're dividing furniture…

139
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,920
Oh.

140
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,500
不能和女人一起住 尤其不能和换了安防密码的女人一起住
{\fs10}Women. Can't live with them, especially if they change the alarm codes.

141
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,610
你25秒就搞定了
{\fs10}You did that in 25 seconds.

142
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,170
所以我总劝别人，还是养条狗好
{\fs10}That's why I tell people to get a dog.

143
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,750
- 找到了 - 好，我们走
{\fs10}- Got it. - All right, let's go.

144
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,850
那不是阿比盖尔的车
{\fs10}That's not Abigail's car.

145
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,900
她在和人约会
{\fs10}She was on a date.

146
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,460
那个男的，不就是白宫的那家伙么
{\fs10}Isn't that that guy？ The White House guy？

147
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,270
下周一是白宫复活节“滚彩蛋”大赛 如果你没什么…
{\fs10}The White House Easter Egg Roll is next Monday. Maybe if you're not…

148
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,300
这人挺怪的
{\fs10}He's weird！

149
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,040
如果孩子们没找到所有彩蛋怎么办？
{\fs10}What happens if kids don't find all the eggs？

150
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,840
你上班在博物馆，回家还住博物馆？
{\fs10}Wow. You work in a museum, and you live in one.

151
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,180
差不多吧
{\fs10}Pretty much.

152
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,770
伶牙俐齿啊，她一定喜欢上他了
{\fs10}What clever repartee. She must like him.

153
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,880
好吧，我带你参观一下这房子
{\fs10}All right, let me give you a tour of the house.

154
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,480
- 好的 - 实际上这里是…
{\fs10}- OK. - That's actually kind of…

155
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,290
阿比盖尔
{\fs10}Oh, Abigail.

156
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,090
- 你到这儿来干嘛？ - 我只是来拿点东西
{\fs10}- What are you doing here？ - I just needed to get some things.

157
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,560
- 康纳，很高兴又见到你了 - 你好盖茨
{\fs10}- Connor, good to see you again. - Gates.

158
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,860
你怎么进来的，本？
{\fs10}How did you get in, Ben？

159
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,470
莱利，给我出来
{\fs10}Riley！ Come out here！

160
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,540
什么事？
{\fs10}What？

161
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,750
嘿，你怎么来了？这里是你家，但是…
{\fs10}Hey！ What are you doing here？ I mean, it's your house, but…

162
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,840
我寄了本我写的书给你，看了吗？
{\fs10}I sent you a copy of my book. Did you get a chance？

163
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,950
不，我还没有读
{\fs10}- No, I haven't read it yet. - Mm.

164
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,020
我认识你，你是白宫的管理人
{\fs10}I know you. You're the White House curator.

165
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,660
- 我是莱利，我们以前见过面，就在… - 对，你是本的助手
{\fs10}- I'm Riley. We met, uh, back in… - Right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant.

166
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,400
什么？
{\fs10}What？

167
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,060
也许我该走了
{\fs10}Um, maybe I should go.

168
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,770
- 嗯，我真的很… - 明晚一起吃饭好吗？
{\fs10}- Yeah, I'm really… - Dinner tomorrow night？

169
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,070
我明天已经有安排了
{\fs10}I… I actually already have plans for tomorrow.

170
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,410
你有吗？
{\fs10}You do？

171
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,340
- 你当然早安排了 - 但我星期五有空
{\fs10}- Of course you do. - But I'm free on Friday.

172
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,510
那太好了
{\fs10}- Awkward. - Oh, great.

173
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,710
- 晚安 - 晚安
{\fs10}- Good night. - Good night.

174
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,990
真不敢相信，你竟然擅闯民宅
{\fs10}I cannot believe you broke in.

175
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,650
- 你拿了什么？ - 都是我自己的东西
{\fs10}- What did you take？ - It's just my things.

176
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,420
交出来，本
{\fs10}Hand it over, Ben.

177
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,060
我得去看布斯日记新发现的那页
{\fs10}I need to see the Booth diary page.

178
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,930
你早已经看过了，上面没有藏宝图
{\fs10}You saw the page yourself. There is no treasure map on it.

179
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,800
但那上面有发现藏宝图的密码 有人用光谱分析过那页纸吗？
{\fs10}No, it's a cipher leading to a map. Anyone spectral-image the page？

180
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,170
没必要，墨水书写的字迹清晰可见
{\fs10}No need to. The ink writing on the page is clearly visible.

181
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,440
可能有的字迹被抹去或者褪色了呢？
{\fs10}It could have been erased or faded.

182
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,970
你是文件保管部门的主管，你应该知道
{\fs10}You're the director of document conservation. You know this.

183
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,040
不归我管，那不是我的部门
{\fs10}Not up to me. It's not my department.

184
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,640
你管的就是那个部门的上级部门
{\fs10}That department reports to your department.

185
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,020
拜托，就用红外线看一次
{\fs10}Come on. One look under infrared.

186
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,050
波士顿茶几可以归你
{\fs10}You can have the Boston Tea Tables.

187
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,190
两张都归我？
{\fs10}Both of them？

188
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,300
这张纸我们已经看了几个小时了
{\fs10}We've been looking at this page for hours.

189
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,960
上面什么都没有
{\fs10}There's nothing there.

190
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,240
本，我认为在这张纸上什么也找不到
{\fs10}Ben, I really don't think we're going to find anything on this page.

191
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,750
你不妨这么想，等到一百年之后
{\fs10}In a hundred years, no one's going to remember

192
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,110
提起暗杀林肯的刺客 大家只会记得布斯一个人的名字
{\fs10}anyone involved in the Lincoln assassination besides Booth.

193
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,350
这可不一定 记得有句老话叫“他，玛德”么？
{\fs10}That's not true. Do you know the expression, "His name is mud"？

194
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,450
- 是的，当然记得 - 你记得？
{\fs10}- Yes. Of course. - You do？

195
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,460
- 那你知道这句话的出处吗？ - 除了你还有谁会知道
{\fs10}- You know the origin of the expression？ - Does anyone but you？

196
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,190
塞缪尔・玛德医生被控是刺杀林肯的同谋
{\fs10}Dr. Samuel Mudd was convicted of being a co-conspirator

197
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,930
后因证据不足，终被法庭释放
{\fs10}in the Lincoln assassination. The evidence was circumstantial.

198
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,800
但那已经无济于事了
{\fs10}He was later pardoned, but it didn't matter.

199
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,640
到现在玛德这名字都没翻身 我不能让盖茨这两个字蒙羞
{\fs10}Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And I will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.

200
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,780
- 本 - 什么？
{\fs10}- Ben. - What？

201
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,250
看这里
{\fs10}Look at this.

202
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,010
看见没有？
{\fs10}- See that？ - Oh.

203
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,850
- 看着好像有字，不是吗？ - 是啊，那几个字好像是“看不清”
{\fs10}- That's quite something, isn't it？ - Yeah. It says "smudge. "

204
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,060
什么都不是啊
{\fs10}It's nothing.

205
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,800
是上一页墨水渗透的痕迹，翻过来看看
{\fs10}Residual ink from the facing page. Flip it.

206
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,300
字母是反的
{\fs10}The letters are backwards.

207
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,360
- 这是密码 - 没错
{\fs10}- It's a cipher. - Yes. It is.

208
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,740
一组密码，字母是成对的，看见没？
{\fs10}A cipher. See how the letters are coupled？

209
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:28,580
普莱费厄密码字母就是成对的 这可以证明他所说的不是谎言
{\fs10}Playfair ciphers encode letters in pairs. This could prove his story.

210
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,050
除非你能破译密码，但这不能证明什么
{\fs10}Unless you decode the cipher, this does not prove a theory.

211
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,350
那没问题，我们只要找到 由五个字母组成的关键字就行了
{\fs10}That's OK. We need a five-letter keyword.

212
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,720
- 那关键字是？ - 我还不知道
{\fs10}- What's the keyword？ - I don't know yet.

213
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,550
- 好吧 - 能打印出来给我吗？
{\fs10}- All right. - Uh, can I get a printout of this？

214
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,530
英语单词可是成千上万啊
{\fs10}There's a billion words in the English language.

215
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,650
还得符合逻辑…让我们从头开始吧
{\fs10}Got to be a logical… Let's start from the beginning.

216
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,290
从A开始…Aardvark{\fs12}（意为土豚）…
{\fs10}A. Aardvark.

217
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,360
我不是故意和你们唱反调 但是我认为已经来不及了
{\fs10}Don't want to rain on your parade here, but I don't think this is gonna stop

218
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,400
尼克尔斯博士明天就要 对外宣布有关该页的发现了
{\fs10}Dr. Nichols from announcing the discovery of the page tomorrow.

219
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,280
等一下，能不能请他等我证明了 托马斯的清白之后再宣布呢？
{\fs10}No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to wait until I prove Thomas is innocent？

220
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,310
那假如他不是清白的呢？
{\fs10}What if he isn't innocent？

221
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,110
联邦调查局总部 约翰・埃德加・胡佛大厦

222
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,650
长官，我们的老朋友本・盖茨又上新闻了
{\fs10}Sir？ Looks like our old friend Ben Gates is in the news again.

223
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,860
他又发现什么了？亚特兰蒂斯吗？
{\fs10}What did he find now？ Atlantis？

224
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,630
布斯日记的遗失页重现江湖
{\fs10}A guy came forward with a missing Booth diary page.

225
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,760
这还不是最精彩的，听听这个
{\fs10}That's not the best part. Listen to this.

226
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,930
在这张写有暗杀林肯的同谋者名单中
{\fs10}"On the page are the names of the conspirators

227
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,030
赫然列有一名之前不为人知的共谋者 托马斯・盖茨
{\fs10}in the Lincoln assassination, as well as a previously unknown conspirator,

228
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:38,410
托马斯・盖茨据说是寻宝猎人 本杰明・富兰克林・盖茨的曾曾祖父
{\fs10}Thomas Gates. Thomas Gates is said to be the great-great-grandfather of treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates. "

229
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,380
- 我还以为就我的亲戚是坏蛋呢 - 这个威尔金森是什么来头？
{\fs10}- Thought my relatives were bad. - What do we know about this Wilkinson？

230
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,650
- 长官？ - 就是这个拿出这张纸的家伙
{\fs10}- Sir？ - Guy claims he had this page

231
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,060
都藏了140年，为什么今天才跳出来？
{\fs10}for 140 years then just suddenly comes forward with it？

232
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,400
- 为什么？ - 我们会查清楚的
{\fs10}- Why？ - We'll find out.

233
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,760
不错
{\fs10}Better.

234
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,930
Bacon{\fs12}（培根）
{\fs10}Bacon.

235
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,800
- 继续 - 这样太傻了
{\fs10}- Keep going. - That's stupid.

236
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,070
- 你老爹怎样了？ - 接着干你的
{\fs10}- How's he doing？ - Keep working.

237
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,680
我们非常感激威尔金森家族
{\fs10}We're grateful to the Wilkinson family

238
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,450
能将这张纸公诸于世
{\fs10}for coming forth with the page.

239
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,390
该页日记上列有之前不为人知的共谋者 托马斯・盖茨
{\fs10}On the page is a name of a previously unknown conspirator, Thomas Gates.

240
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,990
- 尼克尔斯也中邪了，看过这个没有？ - 爸爸，别看那个了
{\fs10}- Nichols has bought into it. See？ - Would you stop watching that.

241
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,500
都已经传上网了
{\fs10}It's on the Internet！

242
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,770
- 势不可挡了 - 盖茨可能就是策划者…
{\fs10}- No stopping it now. - Gates may have been the architect…

243
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,440
- 没有一点同情心 - 你知道真相，这就足够了
{\fs10}- They have no understanding. - You know the truth.That's all that matters.

244
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,810
你从查尔斯爷爷那里听到的故事才是真的
{\fs10} You heard the story from Grandpa.

245
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,250
故事？那家伙拿出的是证据 他就能证明一切
{\fs10}The story？ This guy's got evidence. He's got everything.

246
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,150
我们只有故事，什么都没法证明
{\fs10}We have a story. We have nothing.

247
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,750
盖茨家族扬眉吐气才没多久
{\fs10}For one brief moment, the Gates family could hold its head up.

248
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,880
- 现在又变成一群疯子了 - 但我们不是骗子
{\fs10}- Now we're a bunch of crazies. - But we're not liars.

249
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:01,860
威尔金森说是托马斯・盖茨一手策划了 美国历史上最黑暗的时刻
{\fs10}Wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates was a mastermind to one of the darkest hours in U.S. History.

250
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,490
而且为了掩盖真相，他还焚烧了日记
{\fs10}And he burned the diary page to cover that up.

251
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,670
但你我都知道他之所以烧掉那页日记
{\fs10}You and I both know he burned the page

252
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,230
是为了阻止布斯和他的人找到宝藏
{\fs10}to keep Booth's men from finding the treasure.

253
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,100
那就是我们要去证明的东西
{\fs10}That's what we're going to prove.

254
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,670
- 只有一个方法能证明 - 得找到宝藏
{\fs10}- Only one way to prove it. - Find the treasure.

255
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,110
必须找到它，而且你得帮我一起找
{\fs10}You've got to find it. You're going to help me find it. So come on.

256
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,880
把查尔斯爷爷说过的故事再讲一遍
{\fs10}Let's hear the story again from Grandpa Charles.

257
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,510
爷爷听到他爸爸说到“藏宝图”
{\fs10}Grandpa heard his father say, "Treasure map. "

258
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,650
- 然后外面就乱起来了 - 那些都说过了，之后呢？
{\fs10}- Then there was a commotion. - Got all that. Anything after that？

259
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,290
他有说过什么，做过什么吗？随便什么
{\fs10}Anything he said, something he did？ Anything at all？

260
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,190
- 慢着… - 怎么了？
{\fs10}- Wait a minute. - What？

261
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,460
他握住他儿子的手
{\fs10}He took his son's hand.

262
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,630
看着儿子的眼睛，用最后一口气说到
{\fs10}He looked him in the eye, and he said, with his dying breath,

263
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,580
- 凡人皆要还之债 - 凡人皆要还之债？
{\fs10}- "The debt that all men pay. " - "The debt that all men pay"？

264
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,780
托马斯已经还了
{\fs10}The debt that Thomas paid.

265
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,180
是五个字母
{\fs10}That's five letters.

266
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,010
试试“Death”{\fs12}（死亡）
{\fs10}Try "Death. "

267
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,820
- 什么？ - 是密钥
{\fs10}- What？ - It's the keycode.

268
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,720
凡人皆要还之债，就是死亡
{\fs10}The debt that all men pay is death.

269
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,520
好的
{\fs10}All right.

270
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,430
L，A，B，O，U，L
{\fs10}L-A-B-O-U-L…

271
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,070
是Lab…ool…
{\fs10}It's Lab-ool…

272
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,340
Lab…ahl…La…
{\fs10}Lab-ahl… La…

273
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,570
哪儿来这么个词啊
{\fs10}It's gibberish.

274
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,870
- Laboulaye - 拉布莱伊
{\fs10}- Laboulaye！ - Laboulaye！

275
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,570
- 是什么？ - 是人名，爱德华・拉布莱伊
{\fs10}- What is that？ - It's a who. Edward Laboulaye.

276
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,670
电话在哪？
{\fs10}Where's the phone？

277
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,450
我不知道，这里乱的一塌糊涂
{\fs10}I don't know. Can't find anything in this mess.

278
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,510
- 只是暂时的，找到新地方我就搬走 - 还是找老地方吧，我喜欢她
{\fs10}- Temporary till I find a new place. - Find the old one. I like her.

279
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,790
- 嗨 - 蔡斯博士
{\fs10}- Hi. - Dr. Chase.

280
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,020
- 请叫我阿比盖尔 - 阿比盖尔
{\fs10}- Abigail, please. - Abigail.

281
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,400
- 幸会 - 请坐
{\fs10}- Nice to meet you. - Have a seat.

282
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,030
感谢你能来与我相见
{\fs10}Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

283
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,910
别客气，关于那日记，我正想打电话给你
{\fs10}Of course. I was actually going to call you about the diary page.

284
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,210
- 有新的消息？ - 嗯…
{\fs10}- Any news？ - Well…

285
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,610
在上面发现了一些肉眼难辨的字母组合
{\fs10}We actually found some latent letter fragments on it.

286
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,240
你看
{\fs10}Take a look.

287
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,820
无意义的字母，是密码？
{\fs10}Random letters. A cipher？

288
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,520
- 也许 - 盖茨看过了吗？
{\fs10}- Maybe. - Gates seen this？

289
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,650
就是他发现的
{\fs10}He's the one that discovered it.

290
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,260
- 抱歉 - 没关系
{\fs10}- I'm sorry. - Not a problem.

291
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,360
- 请等我一分钟 - 请便
{\fs10}- I need one minute. - Please, take your time.

292
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,630
嘿，怎么了？
{\fs10}Hey. What？

293
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,170
我们破译了密码，明文是“拉布莱伊”
{\fs10}We cracked the cipher. It's "Laboulaye. "

294
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,970
密码的结果是“拉布莱伊”
{\fs10}The cipher spells "Laboulaye. "

295
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,070
拉布莱伊在法国是名人，这可能并不代表什么
{\fs10}So？ Laboulaye was well-known in France. It could be nothing.

296
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,840
也许如托马斯・盖茨所说，确实有张藏宝图
{\fs10}Or maybe there was a treasure map like Thomas Gates said there was,

297
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,150
而且藏宝图说不定就在拉布莱伊手上 后面还有一个单词，只有开头的部分
{\fs10}and Laboulaye had it. We only got a partial on the next word.

298
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,380
L，A，D，lad…ladder…
{\fs10}L- A-D, lad… ladder…

299
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,120
- L，A，D… - 阿拉丁，阿拉丁？
{\fs10}- L-A-D. - Aladdin！ Aladdin？

300
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,590
- Lady - 谢谢你，阿比盖尔
{\fs10}- Lady！ - Thank you, Abigail！

301
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,690
“拉布莱伊的女士” 你知道拉布莱伊曾策划过什么吗？
{\fs10}Laboulaye Lady. Do you know what Laboulaye was planning

302
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,390
就在林肯被暗杀期间
{\fs10}right around the time Lincoln was assassinated？

303
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,590
好了，本，我要挂了
{\fs10}OK, Ben, I've got to go.

304
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,140
藏宝图或藏宝图的线索就在神像上…
{\fs10}There's a map or a clue to a map on the Statue…

305
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,630
- 她挂了 - 她肯接你的电话，已经不错了
{\fs10}- She hung up. - She took your call. That was good.

306
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,400
- 盖茨博士 - 嗯
{\fs10}- Dr. Gates？ - Yes.

307
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,650
刚才我禁不住偷听了几句，他破译了密码？
{\fs10}Sounds like he cracked the cipher. I couldn't help but overhear.

308
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,780
拉布莱伊，是说爱德华・拉布莱伊？
{\fs10}Laboulaye？ As in Edouard Laboulaye？

309
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,450
他似乎是那么讲的
{\fs10}He seems to believe so, yes.

310
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,920
自由女神像就是根据他的想法建造的
{\fs10}Man who had the idea for the Statue of Liberty.

311
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,220
你说藏宝图在自由女神像上？
{\fs10}You're saying there's a treasure map in the Statue of Liberty？

312
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,200
拉布莱伊曾是个石匠，石匠喜欢 在自己的建筑作品中留下些线索
{\fs10}Laboulaye was a Mason. They built clues into everything.

313
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,130
是从我的书里读到的吧
{\fs10}Did you learn that from my book？

314
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,800
- 对历史有兴趣吗？ - 为之着迷
{\fs10}- Have an interest in history？ - Fascinated by it.

315
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,340
尤其是南北战争
{\fs10}Civil War, especially. My family's descended from

316
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,710
我家是南部邦联将军阿尔伯特・派克的后裔 他是个了不起的人物
{\fs10}Confederate General Albert Pike. He was a remarkable man.

317
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,980
历史不就是一尊伟人功绩的纪念碑吗？
{\fs10}But, then again, what is history but a marker for the deeds of great men？

318
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:44,210
凡人只有一世，但历史会永远铭记你
{\fs10}A man only has one lifetime, but history can remember you forever.

319
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,450
现在问题在于，是哪一座自由女神像？
{\fs10}So the only question is, which Statue of Liberty？

320
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,620
没错
{\fs10}Exactly.

321
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,990
还有第二座？
{\fs10}Is there more than one？

322
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,620
实际上有三座，莱利
{\fs10}There are three, actually, Riley.

323
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,140
一座在纽约，一座在卢森堡公园
{\fs10}One is in New York, one in the Luxembourg Garden.

324
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,040
但他只把其中的一座称为“女士”
{\fs10}But he only referred to one as his "lady. "

325
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,640
法国  巴黎

326
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,590
你的做法太不可思议了
{\fs10}This is like, impossible, what you're doing.

327
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,290
你的欣赏是我的荣幸
{\fs10}I'm glad you're enjoying it.

328
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,390
拉布莱伊一定在那上面留下了线索 去看看火炬
{\fs10}Laboulaye had to leave a clue somewhere on here. Move in on the torch.

329
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,300
让我来，这可不象看起来那么容易
{\fs10}Let me get there. It's not as easy as it looks.

330
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,770
我知道，我明白
{\fs10}No. Believe me, I understand.

331
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,530
抱歉，警官，什么事？
{\fs10}Excuse me, officer. May I help you？

332
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,880
美国人吧？
{\fs10}Ah, American, eh？

333
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,810
在你们看来也许没什么大不了的 但你们扰乱了其他人宁静的早晨
{\fs10}Of course you see no problem in disturbing everyone's pleasant morning

334
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,250
- 就是那个嗡嗡的东西 - 嘿
{\fs10}- with your buzzing there. - Hey！

335
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,620
多亏了你们法国人，才有我们国家的宪法 就是那个孟德斯鸠
{\fs10}You know how much our constitution was influenced by your man, Montesquieu？

336
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,420
- 你知道孟德斯鸠？ - 找到了
{\fs10}- You know Montesquieu？ - Got it.

337
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,030
孟德斯鸠，当然知道啦 “我们要建立一个政府…”
{\fs10}Montesquieu, yeah. "A government should be set up so that… "

338
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,190
“使人不必再惧怕他人”
{\fs10}"… no man need be afraid of another. "

339
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,500
- 说的好 - 谢谢
{\fs10}- That's very good. - Thank you.

340
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,330
- 我很吃惊呀 - 我找到了，找到了
{\fs10}- I'm astonished. - I got it, I got it.

341
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,470
- 希望你看得懂法语 - 我能帮忙吗？
{\fs10}- I hope you read French. - May I？

342
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,780
他可是警察啊
{\fs10}He's a cop.

343
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:22,620
“那双子远渡重洋，坚决…”
{\fs10}Um… "Across the sea these twins stand determined… "

344
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,150
- 坚定 - 坚定，对
{\fs10}- Resolute. - "Resolute," yeah.

345
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,120
“坚定屹立，守护我们的理想”
{\fs10}"… to preserve what we are looking for.

346
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,090
拉布莱伊，1876年
{\fs10}- Uh… Laboulaye, 1876." - Six.

347
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,690
- 这是线索 - 那双子坚定屹立着
{\fs10}- It's a clue. - "These twins stand resolute. "

348
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,700
我想想，坚定的双子
{\fs10}Let's see. Resolute twins.

349
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,700
坚定的
{\fs10}Resolute.

350
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,310
坚定的，而且是双子
{\fs10}Resolute. And then twins.

351
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,010
连体婴儿{\fs12}（连体和暹罗同字）？暹罗？ 是说法国与泰国间的航路吗？
{\fs10}Siamese twins？ Siam？ Trade routes between France and Thailand？

352
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,650
那绝对不可能… 英国皇家海军舰艇，坚定号
{\fs10}That's ridiculous. HMS Resolute.

353
00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:00,050
19世纪时，这艘船曾在北冰洋失踪
{\fs10}A British ship that got lost in the Arctic in the 1800s.

354
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,090
后来这船被美国捕鲸船队发现 美国国会决定将其送还给英国
{\fs10}It was salvaged by American whalers, and then Congress sent it back to England.

355
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,620
这艘军舰退役之后
{\fs10}When the ship was finally retired,

356
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,660
维多利亚女王用船上的木料打造了两张书桌
{\fs10}Queen Victoria had two desks made from its timbers.

357
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,140
哇塞，坚定的双子
{\fs10}Voil？ Resolute twins.

358
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,540
- 那现在这两张桌子在哪儿？ - 较近的一张在伦敦
{\fs10}- And where are those desks now？ - The closest one is in London.

359
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,910
莱利，我们如何才能尽快到达白金汉宫？
{\fs10}How fast can we get to Buckingham Palace？

360
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,540
不知道，为什么不问问你的新朋友
{\fs10}Don't know. Why don't you ask your new best friend？

361
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,640
他会帮你叫出租车
{\fs10}He's going to call you a cab.

362
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,240
好吗？
{\fs10}OK？

363
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,980
- 这直升机很棒，是你的吗？ - 对，是我的
{\fs10}- Nice helicopter. Is that yours？ - Yes, actually. It is.

364
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,150
- 好吧，那罚单也是你的 - 太好了
{\fs10}- OK, so you get the ticket. - Great.

365
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,220
米奇・威尔金森在弗吉尼亚军事学院主修历史
{\fs10}Mitch Wilkinson studied history at Virginia Military Institute.

366
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,170

{\fs10}during the invasion, and in the Congo in the late '90s.

368
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,370
他不仅是一名资深雇佣兵 同时还是一个黑市古董商
{\fs10}These are trained mercenaries as well as being black-market antiquities dealers.

369
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:01,310
一个黑市古董商为什么会 捐献弥足珍贵的南北战争文物呢？
{\fs10}So why does a black market antiquities dealer give up a rare Civil War artifact？

370
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,620
完全可以卖给私人收藏家大赚一笔
{\fs10}Something he could sell to a private collector for a good deal of money？

371
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,190
设备1克隆设备2

372
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,190
正在传输…正在接收

373
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,690
设备克隆已完成

374
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,020
英国  伦敦

375
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,020
女王办公室在这里
{\fs10}So the queen's office is here.

376
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,180
升降机能带你上去
{\fs10}The elevator shaft gets you close,

377
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,090
但是唯一的通道要经过保安室
{\fs10}but the only direct access is through security.

378
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,620
- 真够刺激的 - 得想法子让你先进那房间
{\fs10}- That should be exciting. - We got to get you in that room.

379
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,700
- 嗨，爸爸 - 本
{\fs10}- Hi, Dad. - Ben.

380
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,330
是帕特里克・盖茨打给本的电话
{\fs10}It's Patrick Gates' phone. He's calling Ben.

381
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,460
给我吧
{\fs10}Give me that.

382
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,210
昨晚有人闯进我们家，我被袭击了
{\fs10}The house was broken into last night. I was attacked.

383
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,800
快报警，我这就回来
{\fs10}Call the police. I'm coming home.

384
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,710
- 怎么了？发生什么事了？ - 那于事无补啊
{\fs10}- What？ - What good would that do？

385
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,870
他们什么都没拿，我也没事
{\fs10}They didn't take anything. And besides, I'm fine.

386
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,410
好吧，我们在伦敦，正准备去白金汉宫
{\fs10}OK. We're in London. We're going to Buckingham Palace.

387
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,650
明天下午我们和管理人还有约会
{\fs10}We have an appointment with the curator tomorrow afternoon.

388
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,950
- 好的，儿子，小心点，再见 - 再见
{\fs10}- Son, just be careful. Goodbye. - Bye.

389
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,890
还有其他人在打宝藏的主意
{\fs10}Someone else is after the treasure.

390
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,360
那是肯定的
{\fs10}Of course someone else is after the treasure.

391
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:55,300
- 这是寻宝行业的金科玉律 - 我们必须赶快去看那桌子
{\fs10}- It's the axiom of treasure hunting. - We have to hurry and see that desk.

392
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,560
我们可不能错过那个约会哦
{\fs10}We don't want to miss that appointment.

393
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,830
- 嗨，我是本・盖茨 - 西翼安全公司的吧，请进
{\fs10}- Hi. Ben Gates. - See security. They'll let you in.

394

好，午茶时间到了，伙计们
{\fs10}OK. It's teatime, chaps.

395
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,890
我在找管理人办公室，应该怎么走？
{\fs10}Looking for the curator's office. Which way was it again？

396
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,430
顺着楼梯上去，第一条过道左转
{\fs10}Follow the stairs round, then turn first left.

397
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,130
非常感谢
{\fs10}Thank you so much.

398
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,310
- 本 - 阿比盖尔
{\fs10}- Ben. - Abigail.

399
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,610
- 她怎么在这儿？ - 你怎么在这儿？
{\fs10}- What's she doing here？ - What're you doing？

400
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,770
你爸爸打电话跟我说的 你的下一条线索在这里
{\fs10}Your dad called me. Said your next clue was here.

401
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,780
- 真的是她？ - 本…
{\fs10}- She's really there？ - Ben…

402
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,320
- 甩掉她，摆脱她 - 我想来帮忙
{\fs10}- Drop her. Lose her. - I want to help.

403
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,150
太好了，但现在不是时候
{\fs10}That's very nice, but it's a bad time right now.

404
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,920
- 现在不是时候？ - 对，不是时候
{\fs10}- A bad time, right now？ - It's a bad time.

405
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,620
那好，我大老远的飞到伦敦来帮你
{\fs10}OK, I just flew all the way to London to offer my help…

406
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,100
- 别忘了计划 - 你却不需要？
{\fs10}- Remember the plan. - You don't need it？

407
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,930
你是想来吵架的？
{\fs10}You're the one making a scene.

408
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,440
- 我现在没想跟你吵 - 我们倒是需要吵一吵
{\fs10}- I… I'm not making a scene right now. - We want to make a scene.

409
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,130
那好吧，如果你想吵，那就吵
{\fs10}Well then, fine！ If that's what you want, let's have it out now！

410
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,410
- 太狡猾了 - 我猜猜？是时机不对？
{\fs10}- So subtle. - Let me guess？ It's the wrong time.

411
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,350
还是地方不对？反正又是我的错！
{\fs10}It's the wrong place. I'm wrong again！

412
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,350
我俩的事是我的错 托马斯・盖茨也是我的错
{\fs10}Wrong about us, wrong about Thomas Gates,

413
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,010
以为你会喜欢安娜女王式的椅子 也是我的错！
{\fs10}wrong that you'd like the Queen Anne chair！

414
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,110
你错就错在自认为我喜欢那椅子
{\fs10}You're wrong to assume I'd like the chair.

415
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,060
大家听见没，都来听听 这比导游讲的好听多了
{\fs10}You see？ Everybody, listen to this. This is more interesting than that.

416
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,620
她觉得就算我做对了，也是错 有这道理吗？
{\fs10}She thinks that even when I'm right, I'm wrong！ Isn't that right？

417
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,570
阿比盖尔，如果遇到问题时我抢答了
{\fs10}Abigail, just because I answer a question quickly

418
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,000
那也算是错吗？
{\fs10}doesn't make it wrong.

419
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,770
需要我们两人一起做决定的时候 即使你一个人做对了，那也是错
{\fs10}Not if the answer's something we need to figure out as a couple.

420
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,540
- 两人相处就该这样 - 先生
{\fs10}- That's what couples do！ - Sir.

421
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,600
能请你和这位小姐，去外面解决吗？
{\fs10}You and your missis, take it outside.

422
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,740
看看你都干了什么，你把小警察都招来了
{\fs10}Now look what you've done. You've brought the little bobbies down on us！

423
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,780
你把这位小姐带出去吧，我要留在这
{\fs10}You take the missis outside. I'm staying right here.

424
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,390
本
{\fs10}- Ben！ - Whee！

425
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,180
- 下午好，先生 - {\fs12}（学英国口音）你好
{\fs10}- Good afternoon, sir. - Hello.

426
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,720
- 喝酒了，是吧？ - 就一点
{\fs10}- Been drinking, have we？ - Just a nip.

427
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,820
到酒吧喝了那么一品脱而已，没事的
{\fs10}Popped down to the pub for a pint！ Bit of all right！

428
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:44,370
因为我喜欢威士忌，就要拘捕我？
{\fs10}Going to arrest a man for that？Going to detain a blighter for enjoying his whiskey？

429
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,030
- 够了 - 香肠炖薯泥
{\fs10}- Enough. - Bangers and mash.

430
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,730
土豆炒包菜，烟熏烤鳗派
{\fs10}Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.

431
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,830
- 先生 - 杂碎八宝菜
{\fs10}- Sir！ - Haggis！

432
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,770
- 够了，给我下来 - 我还买了一大堆椰子！
{\fs10}- That's it！ Dismount the banister！ - I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts！

433
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,940
它们就在那儿，排排坐呀…
{\fs10}Here they are, standing in a row！

434
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,070
小个的，大个的，有的就像你脑袋那么大
{\fs10}Small ones, big ones, some as big as your head！

435
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,640
太有才了
{\fs10}That was brilliant.

436
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:05,090
- 作出正确的决定也有错？ - 没错，你也该试着去正确一次
{\fs10}- What's wrong with being right？ - Nothing. You should try it sometime.

437
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,220
- 你是说我从来没做对过？ - 我可没那么说
{\fs10}- You're saying that I'm never right？ - I did not say that.

438
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,420
那我是不是又错了？
{\fs10}Hoo！ So I'm wrong again.

439
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,590
- 瞧瞧，你总算对一次了 - 好得很啊，妙到巅啊
{\fs10}- Now, see, there you are correct. - Capital. Topper.

440
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,900
你妈妈早跟我说过了
{\fs10}Your mother told me about you.

441
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:23,430
- 进去 - 那你为什么不干脆列个清单呢
{\fs10}- In here, please. - Why don't you just make a list

442
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,670
上面写好我能说什么，不能说什么
{\fs10}of what's OK for me to say or not write something…

443
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,640
- 每次都是你自己独自判断对错 - 你们两只唧喳鸟，待在这儿吧
{\fs10}- What's right or wrong… - You two, stay.

444
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,680
- 好吗？ - 别，不要，伙计
{\fs10}- Right？ - No！ No, no, man.

445
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,010
- 别把我关在这儿 - 哇哦
{\fs10}- Don't leave me in here！ - That's great. Wow.

446
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,050
怎么回事情？
{\fs10}What is going on？

447
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,060
很抱歉把你也卷进来 但你的表演真得很棒
{\fs10}I'm sorry for getting you roped into this, but you were excellent.

448
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,220
- 承蒙夸奖，你也不赖 - 你是什么时候察觉的？
{\fs10}- Thank you. So were you. - When did you figure out

449
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:47,020
- 察觉我是假装和你吵的？ - 就在我们假吵的时候…
{\fs10}- it was a fake argument？ - When'd you figure out I was

450
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,760
- 你什么时候察觉到我是真在和你吵？ - 就是吵到一半的时候
{\fs10}- arguing during the fake argument？ - The middle.

451
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,770
你说我自以为是的时候… 莱利，快让我们出去
{\fs10}Where "I assume I'm right. " Get us out. Which I don't get.

452
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,770
我不明白为什么我自认为是对的 并做对了之后却仍然是错的
{\fs10}If I'm right, after I assume I'm right, then I'm correct.

453
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,270
你没有问我就私自决定
{\fs10}When you get to a conclusion without asking,

454
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,370
而你又碰巧做对的话，那不过是你走运而已
{\fs10}and you happen to be right, you got lucky.

455
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,470
那看来我总是走运
{\fs10}I get lucky a lot.

456
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,080
那么，你当我是摆设咯，本？
{\fs10}So where does that leave me, Ben？

457
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,380
你们俩实在是绝配啊
{\fs10}You guys are so great together.

458
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,350
- 想知道我为什么要来这儿吗？ - 当然
{\fs10}- Want to know why I'm here？ - Uh-huh.

459
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,790
我认为女王书房的坚定之桌里可能有线索
{\fs10}Think there may be a clue on the Resolute desk in the queen's study.

460
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,030
明白没有？
{\fs10}Does that help？

461
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,560
我就不明白为什么对你来说 和别人一起做决定会那么难
{\fs10}Don't understand why it's difficult for you to include others in your decisions.

462
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:28,160
即使你能猜到我的回答
{\fs10}Just because you may know what my answer is going to be

463
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,800
也不代表你就可以不问我啊
{\fs10}doesn't mean you don't have to ask me.

464
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,280
一号门，开启中
{\fs10}Door number one, opening.

465
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,440
好吧，我们来试试看
{\fs10}OK. Let me try this out.

466
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,610
阿比盖尔，请你跟我一起去好吗
{\fs10}Abigail, would you like to come with me, please？

467
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,450
好的，谢谢
{\fs10}Yes. Thank you.

468
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,150
搞笑，你得留在这儿
{\fs10}Ridiculous. You're staying.

469
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,160
- 太危险了 - 那我也要去
{\fs10}- It's too dangerous. - I am so coming.

470
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,780
- 二号门 - 二号门，马上好
{\fs10}- Door number two. - Door two, coming up.

471
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,790
- 你不准去 - 那你叫保安啊
{\fs10}- You're not coming. - Call security.

472
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,390
你应该就在升降梯旁边了
{\fs10}You should be near a service elevator.

473
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,700
你干嘛？送花给女王吗？
{\fs10}What are you doing？ Are those for the queen？

474
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,760
女王不在这，王旗没有升起 所以女王应该在温莎堡
{\fs10}Queen's not here. There's no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor.

475
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,370
- 你想干嘛？ - 去看看桌子，不带你，再见
{\fs10}- What are you doing？ - See the desk, without you.

476
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,040
- 不 - 别让她去
{\fs10}- No. - Don't let her go.

477
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,550
阿比盖尔…
{\fs10}Abigail…

478
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,640
好吧，进来，快进来
{\fs10}All right. Get in. Get in. Get in！

479
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,580
拿着
{\fs10}Hold this.

480
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,060
请把花还给我好吗？
{\fs10}Will you give me the flowers back, please？

481
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,190
嗯
{\fs10}Yeah.

482
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,970
- 怎么了？ - 你擦了我送你的香水
{\fs10}- What？ - Wearing the perfume I bought you.

483
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,830
那又如何？
{\fs10}So？

484
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,670
那让我闻到了美女的芬芳
{\fs10}So I think it smells kind of pretty.

485
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,670
- 那是花香，本 - 不，不是
{\fs10}- It's the flowers, Ben. - No, it's not.

486
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,420
我们走
{\fs10}Let's go.

487
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,050
好的，现在左转
{\fs10}OK, now turn left.

488
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,660
- 死路 - 我是说向右，右转
{\fs10}- Dead end. - I mean right. Go right.

489
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,070
- 这花…花瓣…花蕊… - 好，很好
{\fs10}- The flowers… petals… stamens. - Good. Good.

490
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,410
快走，进去
{\fs10}Go, go.

491
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,780
那就是了
{\fs10}That's it.

492
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,380
坚定之桌
{\fs10}The Resolute desk.

493
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,860
我们要找的是…
{\fs10}We're looking for…

494
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,760
镌刻的文字或者图案，或者其它什么的
{\fs10}…writing, patterns in the carvings. Could be anything.

495
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,630
看这个
{\fs10}Hey, look at this.

496
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,840
- 马尔科姆・吉尔瓦里，1880年 - 等一下
{\fs10}- "Malcolm Gilvary, 1880." - Hold on one second.

497
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:53,070
找到了，马尔科姆・吉尔瓦里，他不是做家具的
{\fs10}Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary. He didn't make furniture.

498
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:56,240
他是做中国秘盒的
{\fs10}He made Chinese puzzle boxes.

499
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,680
怎么了？
{\fs10}- Oh… - What？

500
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,360
我认为这抽屉的工作原理和 保险箱上的密码筒类似
{\fs10}I think these drawers work like tumblers in a safe.

501
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,960
好吧，4张抽屉就是4位阿拉伯数字组合
{\fs10}OK, four drawers… Four-digit combination？

502
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,000
会是年份吗？
{\fs10}What about a year？

503
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:21,810
我看看，维多利亚女王，生于1819年
{\fs10}Uh, let me see. Queen Victoria, born 1819.

504
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,710
那就是一
{\fs10}So you go one…

505
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,640
八
{\fs10}Eight.

506
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,710
一
{\fs10}One.

507
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,920
九
{\fs10}Nine.

508
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,870
- 对不对？ - 巴黎女神像火炬上刻的是1876，试试看
{\fs10}- Any luck？ - OK… 1876 was on the inscription on the statue in Paris. Let's try that.

509
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,390
一
{\fs10}One.

510
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,970
八
{\fs10}Eight.

511
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,270
七
{\fs10}Seven.

512
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,380
六
{\fs10}Six.

513
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,910
新问题来了
{\fs10}New rules.

514
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,050
这图案，像是印加或阿兹特克的文字
{\fs10}These markings, like Incan or Aztec.

515
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,350
我之前从来没见过类似的符号
{\fs10}I have never seen any symbols like this.

516
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,790
这看起来比南北战争可要古老的多
{\fs10}I mean, this looks centuries older than Civil War.

517
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,260
你觉得这上面是什么意思？
{\fs10}What do you think it means？

518
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,860
我怀疑这东西跟暗杀林肯计划有关
{\fs10}I doubt it has anything to do with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.

519
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,030
警报，警报，本，快离开
{\fs10}Mayday. Mayday. Ben, get out of there.

520
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,910
- 那两个被拘者去哪了？ - 好，来点响动如何
{\fs10}- Oi！ Where are my detainees？ - OK, let's make some noise.

521
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,920
火警响了
{\fs10}The fire alarm's gone off.

522
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,050
老天保佑女王
{\fs10}Uh-oh. God save the queen.

523
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,020
所有人请撤离
{\fs10}All units, go to action zebra.

524
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,190
- 怎么了？ - 还不清楚
{\fs10}- What's going on？ - Haven't the foggiest.

525
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,360
肯定是什么人或者什么东西触发的
{\fs10}Someone or something is causing this.

526
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:27,700
- 各单位检查各自区域 - 没有道理啊
{\fs10}- Check your primary stations. - This doesn't make any sense.

527
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,040
找出信号源，检查公众四区，八区
{\fs10}Find the source terminal and check public areas four and eight.

528
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:51,020
女士们，先生这边走 谢谢合作，请继续向前走
{\fs10}This way, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. Keep moving.

529
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,720
一直走到喷泉那边
{\fs10}Keep walking until you're on the other side of the fountain.

530
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,130
- 请原谅，请原谅，让一让 - 找到他们了，他们在正门
{\fs10}- Excuse me, excuse me. Coming through. - I got them. They're at the main gate.

531
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,120
- “火花”，别这样 - 好了，我们走
{\fs10}- Oi！ Sparkle. Come on. - OK. Here we go.

532
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,750
我对狗有些过敏
{\fs10}I'm a little bit allergic.

533
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,990
- 谢谢，好了 - 莱利
{\fs10}- Riley. - Thank you. OK.

534

- 回头见，谢谢，再见 - 坐下，对不起
{\fs10}- See you later. Thank you. Bye-bye. - Sit！ Sorry！

535
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,030
谢谢你们等我，东西能让我看看吗？
{\fs10}Thanks for waiting for me. Can I see the thing？

536
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,940
丹尼尔，等等
{\fs10}Daniel, hold it.

537
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,770
那是什么？
{\fs10}What is that？

538
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,540
到白金汉宫就为了这块木头？
{\fs10}Went to Buckingham Palace, all I got was this wood？

539
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,270
看看这些符号，以前从来没见过
{\fs10}Look at the symbols. Never seen anything like this.

540
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,580
这是个不可思议的大发现
{\fs10}It's an incredible discovery.

541
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:51,650
- 威尔金森 - 拦住他们，快，快
{\fs10}- Wilkinson. - Stop them. Go, go, go！

542
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,220
- 那个打宝藏主意的家伙就是他 - 我来开车
{\fs10}- He's the one after the treasure. - I'll drive.

543
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,990
这可是英国
{\fs10}We're in England.

544
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,370
有枪，快趴下
{\fs10}It's a gun！ Get down！

545
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,940
- 我们被困住了 - 趴下，把头低下
{\fs10}- We're trapped！ - Hang on！ Keep your heads down.

546
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,480
你是谁？
{\fs10}Hey, who are you？

547
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,600
抱歉
{\fs10}Sorry.

548
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:00,320
- 本，他们追上来了 - 他们想怎么样啊？
{\fs10}- Ben, they're getting closer. - What is their problem？

549
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,220
- 左转，左转 - 抓紧

小心
{\fs10}Look out！

555
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,460
快，快，快，快
{\fs10}Go. Go, go, go, go！

556
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,620
看到他往哪跑了吗？
{\fs10}Did you see where he went？

557
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,370
- 什么声音？ - 有人电话响，是他打来的
{\fs10}- What is that？ Someone's phone. - It's him.

558
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,670

{\fs10}- Have his number in your speed dial？ - Oh, shu…

559
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,940
趁还没人受伤，及早收手吧
{\fs10}This has to end before someone gets hurt.

560
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,040
把你在白金汉宫拿到的东西给我 就不会有人受伤
{\fs10}Give me what you got at Buckingham, it won't be necessary.

561
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,420
跟我父亲去说吧
{\fs10}Tell that to my father.

562
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,220
白痴
{\fs10}Moron！

563
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,780
他们干嘛站在路中央
{\fs10}Why are they standing in the middle of the street？

564
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,030
- 这些人要去哪？ - 为什么每个人都在跑？
{\fs10}- Where are these people going？ - Why's everyone running？

565
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,770
- 他就在后面，快 - 快开
{\fs10}- He's right there！ Go！ - Move！

566
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,240
让开！
{\fs10}Get out of the way！

567

- 我好像压到谁的脚了 - 小心人群
{\fs10}- Did I just run over a man's foot？ - Watch the people！

00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:39,070
- 不能拍，手机坏了 - 好吧，把木板给我
{\fs10}- No. No, it's broken. - All right. Give me the plank.

572
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,280
坐稳，我们要闯红灯了
{\fs10}Hang on. We're going to run a red light.

侵入伦敦警局的数据库 找出交通探头拍的照片
{\fs10}Hack into the London Police database and get a picture from that traffic cam.

574
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,700

{\fs10}- Okey-dokey. - You can't do it？

575
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,610
我行的，我就是不喜欢你自以为我行
{\fs10}No, I can. I just don't like that you assume that I can.

576
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,240
谢谢你，莱利
{\fs10}Why, thank you, Riley.

577

去拿
{\fs10}Get it！

578
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,830
停车，停车
{\fs10}Stop！ Stop！

579
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,730
- 他拿到了 - 是什么东西？
{\fs10}- He's got it. - What is it？

580
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,200
不知道，但是归我们了，走
{\fs10}I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

581
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,440
华盛顿特区

582
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,440
- 阿比盖尔 - 嘿，帕特里克

{\fs10}Oh, I was hoping to get some of these boxes out of the house.

586
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:35,590
我看不太懂这玩意
{\fs10}I can't read the whole thing, but I can tell you that

587
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,160
但我告诉你们，这些文字肯定是 在殖民时代之前的美洲土著留下的
{\fs10}these are definitely pre-colonial Native American markings.

588
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,640
- 历史远不止500年 - 远远不止
{\fs10}- Easily 500 years old. - Easily.

589
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,410
我认得其中一个符号
{\fs10}I can identify one symbol.

590
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,540
看看这个，你知道那是什么吗？
{\fs10}Look at this. Do you know what that is？

591
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,580
宗教历法？我不知道
{\fs10}Sacred calendrical？ I don't know.

592
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,610
那个符号是“锡沃拉”
{\fs10}That symbol is Cibola.

593
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,550
“锡沃拉”
{\fs10}That's Cibola.

594
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,960
就是黄金之城
{\fs10}The City of Gold.

595
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,820
黄金之城
{\fs10}The City of Gold.

596
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,820
1527年，一艘西班牙船在佛罗里达海岸失事
{\fs10}"In 1527, a Spanish ship wrecked on the Florida coast.

597
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,770
只有四人生还
{\fs10}There were only four survivors.

598
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,830
其中一个是名叫埃斯特班的奴隶 他救了当地部落酋长一命
{\fs10}One was a slave named Esteban who saved a local tribe's dying chief.

599
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,740
作为回报，他被带到部落的圣城
{\fs10}As a reward, he was taken to their sacred city,

600
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,710
一座由黄金打造的城市
{\fs10}a city built from solid gold.

601
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,740
后来，埃斯特班想重新找到这座城市 但再也没能找到
{\fs10}Later, when Esteban tried to find the city again, he never could.

602
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:35,450
但这故事却越传越广，每个来到新大陆的 探险家都在寻找这城市
{\fs10}But the legend grew, and every explorer came to the New World in search of it.

603
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:40,350
1876年，当卡斯特将军一班寻宝人马 在小巨角被土著全歼之后
{\fs10}When General Custer's search for gold ended with his last stand

604
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:44,870
寻找黄金城的最后一丝希望也破灭了
{\fs10}at Little Bighorn, it became clear none would ever find it. "

605
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:55,240
本，想想看，如果南方邦联找到黄金城…
{\fs10}Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates got their hands on the City of Gold…

606
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,450
天啊
{\fs10}My God.

607
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,970
我要找她谈谈
{\fs10}I'm going to go talk to her.

608
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:06,250
- 你也一起去 - 不！
{\fs10}- You're coming with me. - No！

609
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,590
- 除了她没有别人能翻译这个 - 有其他人选的
{\fs10}- Hey. No one else can translate it. - There are others.

610
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,020
有好几个其他人选呢
{\fs10}There are several others.

611
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:14,430
说到古代美洲土著文明，没人比她更合适了
{\fs10}For ancient Native American？ No one better.

612
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,490
- 说谁啊？ - 瞧，本，我不能和你一起去
{\fs10}- Who？ - Look, Ben, I can't go with you.

613
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:20,760
- 已经，已经25年了 - 32年了
{\fs10}- It's been, what？ Twenty-five years. - Thirty-two.

614
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,670
有那么久了？
{\fs10}That long？

615
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:28,100
之所以我们32年没有说过话是有原因的
{\fs10}There's a reason why we haven't spoken in 32 years.

616
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,870
- 我们根本没有共通之处 - 那我呢？
{\fs10}- We have nothing in common. - Me？

617
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:35,380
当然啦，我肯定她和我一样，都以你为傲
{\fs10}Yes, of course. And I'm sure she's just as proud of you as I am.

618
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,850
- 谁啊？ - 他妈妈
{\fs10}- Who？ - His mom.

619
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,820
马里兰大学

620
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:44,950
- 放松点好吗？没事的 - 当然啦，是该往好的方面想
{\fs10}- Will you relax？ It's gonna be fine. - Sure. Should look at the bright side.

621
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,790
过去那么久了，也许她失忆了，不认得我了
{\fs10}Been a long time. Maybe she lost her memory, won't recognize me.

622
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,030
我恨她！
{\fs10}I hate her！

623
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,560
没错就是这儿了
{\fs10}We're in the right place.

624
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:00,870
我可不想趟这汪浑水
{\fs10}I'm gonna take myself out of the line of fire for this one.

625
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,770
- 嗨，妈妈 - 本杰明
{\fs10}- Hi, Mom. - Benjamin！

626
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:06,010
阿比盖尔，好一个惊喜啊，你好，亲爱的
{\fs10}Abigail！ What a surprise！ Hello, sweetheart.

627
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,510
看见没？就一个叹词，心里藏着刀呢
{\fs10}You see？ One syllable, a knife in the heart.

628
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,460
- 不至于吧 - 她做得出来
{\fs10}- Oh, no. - She can do that.

629
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:19,390
正好借这机会问问，我那两把牙刷的下落
{\fs10}I can also track the whereabouts of my toothbrush.

630
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,450
不是我把牙刷丢在马拉喀什的
{\fs10}I was not the one that left the toothbrushes in Marrakech.

631
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,500
照你说的，我把它们都放到旅行包里了
{\fs10}I stowed them both in the travel case, as instructed.

632
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:29,700
对，但是你坚持要负责把行李放上车的
{\fs10}Yes, and you also insisted on loading the luggage into the taxi.

633
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:32,870
- 我没坚持，而且我的确把行李放上车了 - 对，但你没有拿旅行包
{\fs10}- Didn't insist. I loaded the luggage. - Not the travel case.

634
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,140
旅行包不是行李箱好不好 包应该是打在行李箱里的
{\fs10}Travel case is not luggage. The case goes into the luggage.

635
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,580
- 是谁负责打包行李的呢？ - 我没法把旅行包装进行李箱
{\fs10}- Who was in charge of packing？ - I couldn't get the case into

636
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,710
因为里面塞了你买的蠢毯子
{\fs10}the luggage. It was full with that stupid rug you bought.

637
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,880
你以为上面绣有某种秘密
{\fs10}You thought it had secret stitching.

638
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:47,390
- 你说那有多蠢？ - 那上面的确绣有秘密
{\fs10}- How stupid was that？ - Did have stitching.

639
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,820
- 六只绿色假皮皮箱… - 妈妈
{\fs10}- Six phony green leather suitcases… - Mom.

640
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,120
我需要你帮忙看下这个
{\fs10}I need you to take a look at this.

641
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,820
- 这是什么照片？ - 这东西很有意思
{\fs10}- What is that a picture of？ - It's interesting.

642
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:02,030
- 我们认为可能是奥尔麦克文字{\fs12}（奥尔麦克：墨西哥东南的神秘古印第安种族）{\fs18} - 是的
{\fs10}- We think it might be Olmec. - It is.

643
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:05,230
是索克语没错，不过更古老
{\fs10}Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean.

644
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,470
我们希望你能翻译一下
{\fs10}We were hoping that you could translate it.

645
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:10,800
嗯，你们肯定是为了这个才来的
{\fs10}Yes, of course you were.

646
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,980
这不会又跟寻宝有关吧，是不是？
{\fs10}Oh, this doesn't involve another treasure hunt, does it？

647
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,850
妈妈，这个确实非常重要
{\fs10}Mom, this is actually very important.

648
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,260
好吧，看看有些什么
{\fs10}All right. What have we got here？

649
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:29,690
这个…这个象形字…意思是“鸟” 那个么…
{\fs10}This… this glyph here, that means "bird. " And that means…

650
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,760
恩，是尊鸟
{\fs10}Uh, "noble bird. "

651
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:43,370
尊鸟有缘，伸手相牵 圣殿已近，路在眼前
{\fs10}"Find the noble bird, let him take you by the hand and give you passage to the sacred temple. "

652
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:53,250
你们认为这是黄金城的藏宝图，是吧？
{\fs10}Oh, you think this is a treasure map for Cibola, don't you？

653
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,650
嗯，正是如此
{\fs10}Well, that is exactly what it is.

654
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,850
不，那个符号不是指黄金城 而是指世界的中心
{\fs10}No, this glyph doesn't mean "Cibola. " It means "the center of the world. "

655
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,830
你以前很喜欢这个的 她就是在寻宝的路途中爱上我的
{\fs10}You know, you used to like it. She fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.

656
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:07,600
那不是爱情，是冲动，肾上腺素加上龙舌兰酒
{\fs10}That was not love. That was excitement, adrenaline and tequila.

657
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,470
- 妈妈… - 我不过是想拿到学分而已
{\fs10}- Mom… - I was trying to get course credit.

658
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,070
除非你最近不看书不读报 你该知道寻宝是有回报的
{\fs10}Treasure hunting paid off, in case you haven't read the papers.

659
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,300
但那跟你没什么关系，是本干的
{\fs10}Had nothing to do with you. That was Ben.

660
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,680
本发现了宝藏，你什么都没干
{\fs10}Ben found the treasure. You did nothing.

661
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:22,650
帕特里克，艾米丽，别吵了 我们专心解译古文吧？
{\fs10}Patrick, Emily, please. Can we just figure out what's on the page？

662
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:26,950
就这么多了，恐怕帮不了你们
{\fs10}Well, that's it, I'm afraid.

663
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,850
这些象形文字少了一部分 你们只拿到了一半藏宝图
{\fs10}These glyphs are only partials. So you only have half a treasure map.

664
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,260
我很遗憾
{\fs10}I'm sorry.

665
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,030
我倒不是很惊讶
{\fs10}Not that I'm surprised.

666
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,090
至少我们知道其余的部分在哪
{\fs10}At least we know where the rest of the map is.

667
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,070
什么？
{\fs10}What？

668
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:45,900
你知道在哪？那你为什么不告诉我
{\fs10}You know where it is？ Why didn't you tell me？

669
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,640
原因很简单，你这个人容易反应过度
{\fs10}Obviously you have a tendency to overreact！

670
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,220
- 对不起 - 我也是
{\fs10}- I'm sorry. - So am I.

671
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,770
那究竟在哪儿呢？
{\fs10}So where is it？

672
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:01,480
巴黎的雕像上铭写着 “双子坚定的屹立”
{\fs10}Inscription on the statue in Paris said, "These twins stand resolute. "

673
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,050
我们认为地图被分藏在两张坚定之桌内
{\fs10}We think the map's divided between the two Resolute desks.

674
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:08,650
坚定之桌…就是那张坚定之桌？
{\fs10}The Resolute desk. The Resolute desk？

675
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:10,630
总统的书桌？
{\fs10}President's desk？

676
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,030
总统，什么总统？
{\fs10}The president. What president？

677
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,040
- 是我们的总统么？ - 很不幸，就是他
{\fs10}- Our president？ - Unfortunately, yes.

678
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:17,630
如此一来…
{\fs10}But that means…

679
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,040
这么说，那我们就得…
{\fs10}Wait, so we have to…

680
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,500
去白宫？
{\fs10}The White House？

681
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:26,370
确切的说，是去总统办公室
{\fs10}The Oval Office… to be exact.

682
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,780
我怎么可能会对这个反应过度呢？
{\fs10}Why would I overreact to that？

683
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,290
- 我们事先约定的不是这个 - 请你专心处理眼前的问题好吗？
{\fs10}- That's not what I signed on for. - Could we focus on the issue at hand？

684
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:42,420
谢谢
{\fs10}Thank you.

685
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:48,360
年代很久远，早于哥伦布时期
{\fs10}It's early, pre-Columbian.

686
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,700
- 你能翻译吗？ - 别开玩笑了
{\fs10}- Can you translate it？ - Are you kidding？

687
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:54,070
这是一种极其罕见的已经失传的语言
{\fs10}This is an extinct, exceedingly rare language.

688
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,940
只有极少数一些人在研究这些语言
{\fs10}Only a handful of people study these languages.

689
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,410
如何找到那些人？
{\fs10}Where are we to find them？

690
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:02,480
在大学里也许能找到人 但你拿到的东西不完整
{\fs10}Universities, I suppose. But you don't have the whole thing.

691
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:03,540
什么意思？
{\fs10}What do you mean？

692
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:07,850
这些象形字被切断了
{\fs10}These glyphs here… they're cut off.

693
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,090
还有其它地图？我们去哪找？
{\fs10}There's more to the map？ How are we going to find that？

694
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:14,030
我们不用找，盖茨会去找的
{\fs10}We won't have to. Gates will get it somehow.

695
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,770
坚定之桌的位置靠着总统办公室的南墙
{\fs10}The Resolute desk is near the south wall in the Oval Office.

696
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:21,030
看这个，看
{\fs10}Look at this. Look.

697
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,970
桌子的正面有扇小门
{\fs10}Small door on the front of the desk.

698
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,500
罗斯福装的，想遮掩他的轮椅
{\fs10}FDR had that put in so guests couldn't see his wheelchair.

699
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,480
- 但是… - 伙计们，看下这个
{\fs10}- But… - Guys, take a look at this.

700
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,750
这也许能行
{\fs10}This could work.

701
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:36,550
阿比盖尔，该和你的新男友来一次约会了
{\fs10}I believe it's time for you to make a date with your new boyfriend.

702
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,080
说的没错
{\fs10}I think you're right.

703
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:45,620
欢迎参加白宫复活节滚蛋赛
{\fs10}We hope you're enjoying the White House Easter Egg Roll.

704
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:49,790
两点钟在南边喷泉有脸谱彩绘
{\fs10}Face painting continues at 2:00 near the south fountain.

705
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:54,830
- 那只大兔子是康纳扮的吗？ - 谢谢
{\fs10}- That Connor in the bunny suit？ - Thank you.

706
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,030
我没参加过滚蛋赛，满有趣的
{\fs10}I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll. It's kind of sweet.

707
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,770
嗯，我也很喜欢
{\fs10}Yeah, I love it.

708
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:05,510
我认识你，你的曾曾祖父杀了林肯总统
{\fs10}I know you. Your great-great-grandfather killed President Lincoln.

709
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,950
不，那是约翰・威尔克斯・布斯干的
{\fs10}No. That would be John Wilkes Booth.

710
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,180
艾森施密尔说布斯是受人指使
{\fs10}Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool

711
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,690
这个惊天阴谋还牵涉到林肯的内阁成员
{\fs10}in a greater conspiracy that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.

712
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,120
胡说！艾森施密尔的书里…
{\fs10}Absurd. Eisenschiml's book is filled with

713
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,160
- 尽是些不实的研究和错误的假设 - 哦，是吗？
{\fs10}- spotty research and false assumptions. - Oh, yeah？

714
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,360
那晚林肯的保镖擅离职守，怎么解释？
{\fs10}Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard left his post that night？

715
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:25,830
因为林肯总统去戏院时从来不带保镖
{\fs10}Because President Lincoln was never accompanied by guards

716
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,430
尤其是在美好的周五晚上，听到没有？
{\fs10}when attending the theater. Listening？ Especially on Good Friday.

717
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,470
那晚华盛顿所有出城道路都被封锁了
{\fs10}Explain why all the bridges out of Washington were closed

718
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,700
唯独只有布斯出逃的那条路没封锁 这你又怎么解释？
{\fs10}except one, the one Booth needed to escape？

719
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,750
走开，讨厌的小鬼，快走
{\fs10}OK, run along now, you impossible child. Run along.

720
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,940
美国的教育究竟是怎么了？
{\fs10}What is going on with the education in America？

721
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,990
- 嘿，嘿 - 康纳
{\fs10}- Hey！ Hey！ - Connor！

722
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:48,520
你终于来了，我很高兴
{\fs10}- I'm so glad you decided to come… - Hey.

723
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,150
- …盖茨也来了啊 - 康纳
{\fs10}…with Gates. - Connor.

724
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,290
- 我们碰巧遇上 - 哦
{\fs10}- We just ran into each other. - Oh.

725
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:58,860
你不是有事要问他吗？
{\fs10}Aren't you going to ask him？

726
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:00,420
- 问我什么？ - 没什么
{\fs10}- Ask me what？ - Nothing.

727
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,630
- 不，好好说，要问什么？ - 我实在不想强人所难
{\fs10}- No, really. What？ - I really wouldn't want to impose.

728
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,840
她的意思是，她认为你做不到
{\fs10}Well, what she means is she doesn't think you can.

729
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:12,040
- 认为我做不到什么？ - 她想参观总统办公室
{\fs10}- Doesn't think I can what？ - She wants to see the Oval Office.

730
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:15,980
- 不，我知道这要求太过分了 - 这没什么
{\fs10}- No. That is way too much to ask. - No, it's, uh…

731
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,180
- 我能搞定 - 真的吗？
{\fs10}- I can do that. - Really？

732
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,240
我说的吧
{\fs10}You see？

733
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:22,220
- 你真的可以？ - 嗯
{\fs10}- You can？ - Yeah.

734
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:26,590
那太棒了，我一直都想看看总统办公室
{\fs10}That is so cool, Connor. I have always wanted to see the Oval Office.

735
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,320
康纳真牛
{\fs10}Connor rocks.

736
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,020
我们到了
{\fs10}Well… here we are.

737
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:39,170
帝王般的家具，锯齿状的装饰，我就喜欢！
{\fs10}Empire furnishings and crenelated molding. Love it.

738
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,040
站在这房中，感觉真奇妙，是不是？
{\fs10}Amazing feeling, isn't it, standing in here？

739
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:47,100
- 是啊，太棒了 - 你…
{\fs10}- Yes. Amazing, huh？ - Oh, could…

740
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,310
对不起
{\fs10}Oh. Sorry.

741
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:54,580
那是坚定之桌
{\fs10}Oh, that's, uh… The Resolute desk.

742
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,320
你可能看过肯尼迪小儿子那张知名照片
{\fs10}Might recognize it from the photo of young JFK Junior

743
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:00,990
趁他父亲办公时在下面玩
{\fs10}playing underneath while his father was working.

744
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:02,930
- 令人惊叹啊 - 嗯
{\fs10}- Wonderful. - Yeah.

745
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,900
但是很多人不知道
{\fs10}But many people don't know

746
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:09,430
在白金汉宫里有张一模一样的桌子
{\fs10}that this desk has a twin that sits in Buckingham Palace.

747
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,530
- 真有此事？ - 谁会知道这个啊？
{\fs10}- Isn't that something？ - Who knew？

748
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,870
从拉瑟福德・海斯开始{\fs12}（拉瑟福德・海斯：1877～1880年在任）
{\fs10}Every president since Rutherford B. Hayes

749
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,880
每一任总统都用过那张桌子 除了约翰逊和尼克松之外
{\fs10}has used that desk, except, uh, Johnson and Nixon.

750
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,410
还有福特也没用过
{\fs10}And Ford, of course.

751
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,980
- 他用过的 - 他没用过
{\fs10}- Uh, no. - Uh, yes.

752
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,070
- 用过的 - 没用过
{\fs10}- No. - Yes.

753
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,880
阿比盖尔，你是不是掉了一只耳环？
{\fs10}Abigail！ Did you lose an earring？

754
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,590
哦，我…我真弄丢了一只
{\fs10}Oh！ I… I did, yes.

755
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:32,920
康纳，那耳环是我祖母给我的
{\fs10}Connor, these were given to me by my grandmother.

756
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:36,790
我想我们该四处找一下 你不会希望有人发现
{\fs10}I suppose we should look for it. Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring

757
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,800
不属于第一夫人的耳环吧？
{\fs10}that doesn't belong to the first lady in the Oval Office.

758
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,230
- 对 - 说的好
{\fs10}- Yes. - Excellent point,

759
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,600
我们不该出现在这儿的…
{\fs10}considering we're not supposed to be here.

760
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:48,310
- 嗯 - 我们不如就从那里开始找吧？
{\fs10}- Yeah. - Why don't we, um, go over here and check it out？

761
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,010
我在这儿找
{\fs10}I'll check over here.

762
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:03,550
- 你认为会不会掉到下面去了 - 嗯
{\fs10}- Do you think it fell down here？ - Yes.

763
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:13,600
- 也可能在这儿 - 有可能
{\fs10}- Maybe here. - Probably.

764
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,340
哦，没有
{\fs10}Oh, no.

765
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,520
- 你刚才坐过沙发 - 那些大兔子
{\fs10}- You did sit on the sofa. - Oh, the bunnies.

766
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,550
康纳
{\fs10}Connor！

767
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,790
- 你找到了 - 是我找到的
{\fs10}- You found it. - I did.

768
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,700
非常感谢
{\fs10}Thank you so much！

769
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:01,250
你是最棒的
{\fs10}You're just the best. Mm.

770
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,200
谢谢
{\fs10}Thank you.

771
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,440
没什么
{\fs10}OK.

772
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:30,270
- 那里是空的 - 一定被人拿走了
{\fs10}- Empty. - Someone must've taken it.

773
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:33,940
我们国家最聪明的一群人 在那桌前坐了一百多年了
{\fs10}Brightest men in our country sat at that desk for over a hundred years.

774
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,140
- 看看这个 - 其中肯定有人发现了地图
{\fs10}- Look. - Course one of 'em found the map.

775
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,710
- 木头上有一个标记 - 是总统的印章吧
{\fs10}- A symbol stamped into the wood. - The presidential seal.

776
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,690
这不是总统的印章
{\fs10}It's not the presidential seal.

777
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,420
图中这只鹰抓的是卷轴，而不是橄榄树枝
{\fs10}The eagle's holding a scroll instead of olive branches.

778
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:48,400
- 我不敢确定这是什么意思 - 我们怎么办
{\fs10}- I'm not sure what this is. - What do we do？

779
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,060
你们当中就没人读过我的书吗？
{\fs10}Did none of you read my book？

780
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:54,230
持卷之鹰
{\fs10}The eagle clutching the scroll.

781
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,400
- 你知道这代表什么？ - 嗯
{\fs10}- Do you know what it means？ - Yeah.

782
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:58,600
但我没法用三言两语说清楚
{\fs10}But it's not something I could tell you.

783
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:03,610
只好借我的书来让你们明白了
{\fs10}It's something that I have to show you… in my book.

784
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,620
- 你连信壳都没拆？ - 我不是正在搬家嘛
{\fs10}- You didn't even open it？ - I was moving.

785
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,250
第13章
{\fs10}Chapter 13.

786
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:24,330
- “总统秘卷”？ - “总统秘卷”
{\fs10}- "The President's Secret Book"？ - "The President's Secret Book. "

787
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:32,040
这是一本由历任总统亲撰，在总统间 代代相传的档案辑，只有总统才能看
{\fs10}It happens to be a collection of documents for presidents by presidents, and for presidents' eyes only.

788
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,840
伙计们，我说的不仅仅是约翰・肯尼迪
{\fs10}And I'm not just talking about JFK here, guys.

789
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:40,350
水门事件中神秘消失的十八又半分钟录音
{\fs10}The 18 and a half missing minutes of the Watergate tapes.

790
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:45,150
阿波罗号是否真的登月了？是真是假？
{\fs10}Did the Apollo really land on the moon？ Did it？ Did it？

791
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:49,180
还有世人最为好奇的，51区{\fs12}（51区：传说中研究外星人的秘密基地）
{\fs10}And the coup de grce… Area 51.

792
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,390
拜托，莱利，那些不过是民间传说
{\fs10}Come on, Riley. That's… that's an urban legend.

793
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:55,400
真的吗，阿比盖尔？是这样吗？
{\fs10}Is it, Abigail？ Is it？

794
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:57,630
这些实在是太…
{\fs10}It's just totally…

795
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:58,960
- 疯狂？ - 对
{\fs10}- Crazy？ - Yeah.

796
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,800
我们就是靠着疯狂，才有了今天啊
{\fs10}Hm. 'Cause last time I checked, we pretty much make our living on crazy.

797
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:07,040
- 他说的对 - 我想是吧
{\fs10}- He's got a point. - I guess so.

798
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,670
一样的图案
{\fs10}Same symbol.

799
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:13,150
1966年因资讯公开法而公之于众
{\fs10}Released in '66 under the Freedom of Information Act.

800
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,940
鹰和卷轴
{\fs10}The eagle and the scroll,

801
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:19,280
总统秘卷的专属标记
{\fs10}the secret symbol in the President's Book.

802
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:22,150
你的意思是，那块木板上的内容
{\fs10}So you're saying that whatever was on that plank

803
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,120
现在应该在总统秘卷里？
{\fs10}is now in the President's Secret Book？

804
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:28,830
本
{\fs10}Ben.

805
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,590
如果换作是你想说服我的话
{\fs10}If it was you trying to convince me…

806
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,100
即使你没什么证据，我也一样会信你
{\fs10}…you'd have less evidence, and I'd already believe you by now.

807
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,540
持卷之鹰？
{\fs10}The eagle with the scroll？

808
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,310
阴谋论者相信
{\fs10}Conspiracy theorists like to believe

809
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,250
这是总统秘卷的标记
{\fs10}that it's the symbol for the President's Secret Book.

810
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,910
你竟然买了莱利的书
{\fs10}You bought Riley's book.

811
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:55,390
你的朋友写了本关于政府阴谋的书
{\fs10}Your friend writes a book about government conspiracies.

812
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,930
- 你以为我们会不知道？ - 但这是真的吗？
{\fs10}- You don't think we know about it？ - But is it true？

813
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:00,430
总统真的有一本秘卷吗？
{\fs10}Does the president have a secret book？

814
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,600
喜欢鸭子吗？
{\fs10}Do you like ducks？

815
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,270
确实有这么一本书
{\fs10}There is a book.

816
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:16,610
你为什么要出来告诉我？
{\fs10}Why are you telling me out here？

817
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,250
因为在里面，我是名联邦探员
{\fs10}Because inside, I'm a federal agent.

818
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,580
在外面，我是作为一名朋友和你谈话
{\fs10}Out here, I'm talking to you as a friend.

819
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:27,050
- 那么总统秘卷保存在哪儿呢？ - 只有现任总统才知道
{\fs10}- Where's the President's Book kept？ - Only the current president knows.

820
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,720
这本书是由总统代代相传的
{\fs10}The book is passed from president to president,

821
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:32,060
每一任都亲自选择藏书的地点
{\fs10}and each one chooses his own hiding place.

822
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:34,150
你是FBI，能帮我找到它吗？
{\fs10}You're the FBI. Can't you get it for me？

823
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:37,790
要看那本书的唯一途径就是成为总统
{\fs10}Only way you'll ever see that book is if you get elected president.

824
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:40,230
世事难料啊
{\fs10}Well, you never know.

825
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,330
我只需要接近他几分钟就行
{\fs10}All I need is a few minutes with him.

826
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:47,000
几分钟？真的？
{\fs10}A few minutes？ Really？

827
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,310
就算你嫁给了总统
{\fs10}Even if you were married to the president,

828
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,640
都不一定能和他待上几分钟
{\fs10}you wouldn't be able to get a few minutes.

829
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:54,710
他身边有人的话，当然不行 如果我能和单独见到他…
{\fs10}Not when he's surrounded by handlers. If I get him alone…

830
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,080
你怎么可能单独和总统见面？
{\fs10}How do you expect to get the president alone？

831
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:00,280
南北战争之前，各州分立
{\fs10}Before the Civil War, the states were all separate.

832
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,110
人们称之为“众国”
{\fs10}People used to say, "The United States are. " Are

833
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:09,490
直到内战结束后，人们方称之为“合众国”
{\fs10}Wasn't until the war ended people started saying, "The United States is. "

834
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:15,890
是林肯让我们的国家从分裂走向统一
{\fs10}Under Lincoln… we became one nation.

835
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,130
而林肯为此付出了生命代价
{\fs10}And Lincoln paid for it with his life.

836
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:20,700
- 托马斯・盖茨也是如此 - 对
{\fs10}- So did Thomas Gates. - Right.

837
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,110
以身报国
{\fs10}With his life.

838
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:28,570
我要如何才能与他单独相处呢？
{\fs10}So how am I gonna get him alone？

839
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:33,550
我要绑架他
{\fs10}I'm gonna kidnap him.

840
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,180
我要绑架美国总统
{\fs10}I'm gonna kidnap the president of the United States.

841
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,960
- 这可不好笑 - 我是你父亲
{\fs10}- That's not funny. - I'm your father.

842
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:47,260
你要我说什么？你不能自毁前程
{\fs10}How do you expect me to respond？ I can't let you ruin your life.

843
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,330
你疯了吗？
{\fs10}Are you out of your mind？

844
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,460
读了我的书就知道，你没机会拿到秘卷
{\fs10}Read my book, and you'd know you can't get to that book.

845
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,940
你究竟打算怎么干？
{\fs10}Exactly how do you plan on doing this？

846
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,170
弗农山庄{\fs12}（华盛顿故居）
{\fs10}- I was thinking Mount Vernon. - Oh.

847
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,440
- 什么？ - 我加入
{\fs10}- What？ - I'm in.

848
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:04,380
长官，我们必须更改宴会的地点
{\fs10}Sir, we have to move the party.

849
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:04,380
{\fs15\pos(320,212)}白宫新闻厅

850
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,350
某个历史学家说，斯宾塞地标大酒店…
{\fs10}Some historian claims the Spencer Landmark Hotel

851
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:09,910
在19世纪后期曾是3K党的聚会场所
{\fs10}was used for Klan meetings in the late 1800s.

852
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:13,450
- 有谁知道这是不是真的？ - 长官，华盛顿公报打电话来
{\fs10}- Anyone know if this is true？ - I've got the Washington Gazette.

853
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:17,620
他们想报导 “总统是否漠视少数民族？”
{\fs10}They want a quote on, "Is the president being insensitive to minority issues？"

854
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,330
- 真假已经无所谓了 - 弄张备选地点的清单来…你那儿怎样？
{\fs10}- Doesn't matter. - Get a list of approved alternates.

855
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,560
嗯，我知道是仓促了点
{\fs10}- What do you have？ - Yeah, I know it's short notice.

856
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:27,340
但我们之前订的饭店，水管爆了
{\fs10}The pipe burst in the hotel that we previously booked.

857
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:32,440
- 那儿现在水漫金山 - 我要安排个200人规模的退休餐会
{\fs10}- I… There is water everywhere. - A retirement party for 200 people.

858
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:35,280
- 在冈斯顿庄园 - 蒙蒂塞洛也被定了
{\fs10}- Gunston Hall. - Monticello is booked.

859
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:37,610
冈斯顿庄园和都铎广场也是一样
{\fs10}So is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place.

860
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:41,050
登比酒店尚有空缺，还有弗农山庄
{\fs10}The Denby Hotel is available, and so is Mount Vernon.

861
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,290
- 你真是我的大救星啊 - 登比酒店不错
{\fs10}- Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver. - The Denby is great.

862
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,560
不用考虑了，登比酒店刚刚被人订了 只剩弗农山庄了
{\fs10}Strike that. The Denby was booked. Mount Vernon's all we got.

863
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:50,830
快订，别又让别人订了
{\fs10}Book it before someone else does.

864
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:58,130
今天能来这儿是本人的莫大荣幸
{\fs10}And let me say what an honor it is to be here

865
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,540
请允许我向总统先生说声，生日快乐
{\fs10}and add my happy birthday to you, Mr. President.

866
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,540
弗吉尼亚  弗农山庄

867
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:33,000
- 晚上好，先生 - 晚上好
{\fs10}- Good evening, sir. - Good evening.

868
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:35,740
你知道这儿是管制区域吗？
{\fs10}Are you aware that you are in a restricted area？

869
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:38,330
知道，但是这儿有鱼啊，年轻人
{\fs10}Yeah, but this is where the fish are, son.

870
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:41,850
可能吧，但你得把船往上游开
{\fs10}That may be, but I'm gonna need to have you move upriver.

871
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,050
你知道吗，根据马里兰州宪法第25章第1条
{\fs10}Are you aware that according to article one, section 25

872
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,720
我有在公用水域钓鱼的权利
{\fs10}of the Maryland constitution, I'm allowed to fish in public water？

873
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:58,660
你是否知道，我可以无条件拘留你48小时？
{\fs10}Are you aware I have the right to detain you for the next 48 hours without cause？

874
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:03,800
我会尽快走人回家的
{\fs10}I am going to go back where I came from just as fast as possible.

875
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:14,910
等到哪天我受邀参加酒会 说不定也会穿这一身衣服
{\fs10}Maybe one day I'll wear this thing to a party I was actually invited to.

876
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:27,590
晚8点例检，11区请回话
{\fs10}Twenty hundred time check. Station 11.

877
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,220
- 没有情况，周围安全 - 你好
{\fs10}- All clear. Perimeter secure. - Hey.

878
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,630
你有没有看到附近有个可爱的褐发女子？
{\fs10}You didn't happen to see a cute brunette wandering around？

879
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,790
- 我刚去拿了杯饮料，回来她就不见了 - 没有，先生
{\fs10}- Went to get a drink, she disappeared. - No, sir.

880
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,030
今晚我要放空枪了
{\fs10}I've got no game tonight.

881
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:49,940
晚上好，阁下…你好
{\fs10}Good evening, Your Excellency. Hello.

882
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:54,040
首相大人，很高兴您又来美国了
{\fs10}Prime Minister, it's a delight to have you back in the States.

883
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:58,250
宣传这个观点，竞选赞助限额 并不是强制执行的，因为总统…
{\fs10}Spread the word, contribution limits not enforced on the president's birth…

884
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,810
- 生日快乐，总统先生 - 谢谢
{\fs10}- Happy birthday. - Thank you.

885
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:03,580
- 我是本・盖茨，记得圣殿财宝么？ - 噢，是你啊，本・盖茨
{\fs10}- Ben Gates. The Templar treasure？ - Oh, right, Ben Gates. Yeah.

886
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:06,920
- 我们就不占您的时间了 - 非常感谢
{\fs10}- We won't keep you. - Thanks so much. Always a pleasure.

887
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:11,330
今晚能被邀来参加酒会，我兴奋得要命
{\fs10}I can't tell you what a thrill it is for me to be invited here tonight, sir.

888
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,270
对，现在的你一定让情报机关忙到不行
{\fs10}Yeah, you must have the Secret Service hopping about now.

889
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:16,670
您说什么？
{\fs10}Sir？

890
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,800
因为你有了新的身世嘛
{\fs10}Considering your discovered lineage.

891
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:21,400
- 噢，对，那个…… - 继续说吧
{\fs10}- Oh, yeah. Oh, that… - Carry on.

892
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:24,670
对不起，先生，但是我知道你很崇拜华盛顿
{\fs10}I beg your pardon, sir, but I know what a huge admirer you are

893
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,740
我觉得您该想看看这个
{\fs10}of George Washington. I thought you might want to take a look at this.

894
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,370
看一下
{\fs10}Have a look at that.

895
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:34,050
这是华盛顿亲手绘制的弗农山庄地图
{\fs10}This is a map of Mount Vernon drawn by George Washington himself.

896
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,990
总统先生，您说的太对了
{\fs10}Mr. President, that is exactly what it is.

897
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,820
- 耶鲁大学，建筑历史系 - 我不知道您是学这个的
{\fs10}- Architectural history major, Yale. - I did not know that.

898
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:42,690
这是我叔祖父的
{\fs10}It belonged to my great uncle.

899
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,890
原属于叫夏洛特的奴隶的孙女
{\fs10}Got it from the granddaughter of a slave, Charlotte.

900
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,260
- 生日快乐，总统先生 - 非常感谢
{\fs10}- Happy birthday. - Always a pleasure. Thank you so much.

901
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:51,900
夏洛特曾在弗农山庄工作生活过
{\fs10}Charlotte, who lived here and worked here at Mount Vernon.

902
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:55,340
- 是啊 - 我们现正站在这个地方
{\fs10}- Yeah. - And we're standing right here, sir.

903
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:59,670
这条线代表了一条地下通道 一条从未曾被人发现的逃生通道
{\fs10}This line is an underground tunnel, an escape route that was never found.

904
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:03,410
不知道…不知道现在还在不在
{\fs10}I wonder… I wonder if it's still there.

905
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,580
那么…
{\fs10}Well…

906
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:10,350
- 要知道答案只有一种方法 - 不如我们去看看
{\fs10}- Only one way to find out, sir. - Maybe we should take a look.

907
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,650
我们可以吗？
{\fs10}Are we allowed to do that？

908
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:16,430
我知道您当然可以，您是总统
{\fs10}I mean, I know you're allowed to do that. You're the president.

909
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,760
我能跟您一起去吗？
{\fs10}Can I come with you？

910
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:22,060
- 你们真是无所不在啊 - 是，先生
{\fs10}- You guys are just everywhere. - Yes, sir.

911
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,660
- 把手电给我的朋友 - 谢谢
{\fs10}- Give my friend your flashlight. - Thank you.

912
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,540
根据地图，应该是…
{\fs10}According to this map, it should be…

913
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:33,600
是一…二，在这儿
{\fs10}It's one… two. In here.

914
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,310
对，应该是这儿
{\fs10}Yeah, should be in here.

915
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,350
- 我可以进去吗？ - 当然
{\fs10}- May I？ - Absolutely.

916
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,910
好
{\fs10}All right.

917
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:46,730
克雷格，对你的工作我表示感激
{\fs10}You know, Craig, I appreciate you doing your job,

918
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:48,780
但是这儿没有我的敌人
{\fs10}but I have no enemies down here.

919
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,620
在这个地下室，这个小房间里
{\fs10}In the cellar. In this tiny little room.

920
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,400
那我就在这儿等吧
{\fs10}I'll just wait here, then.

921
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:07,870
这边
{\fs10}Over here.

922
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,150
- 那是乔治・华盛顿的标记 - 有点不一样
{\fs10}- That's the mark of George Washington. - Only it's slightly different.

923
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:18,780
- 怎么不一样？ - 斧头的角度不一样
{\fs10}- How？ - These axes, the angle's off.

924
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:25,560
根据地图上画的，应该是个完美的V字
{\fs10}For it to correspond with the ones on the map, it should form a perfect V.

925
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:32,970
好，还有什么
{\fs10}OK, what else？

926
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:35,810
箭头…
{\fs10}The arrowhead…

927
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,070
偏到一边了
{\fs10}…is sideways.

928
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,880
我们很好，别担心
{\fs10}We're all right. Don't worry.

929
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:56,590
看看
{\fs10}Look at that.

930
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,390
来吧
{\fs10}Come on.

931
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,630
总统先生？
{\fs10}Mr. President？

932
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:09,770
9区有情况！
{\fs10}We have a breach in zone nine！ There's…

933
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,180
- 通知费尔法克斯郡政府 - 周边通报情况，封锁所有出口
{\fs10}- Inform Fairfax, SecTac Channel One！ - Perimeter detail, lock down all exits！

934
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:19,820
- 盖茨，你在干什么 - 对不起，总统先生
{\fs10}- Gates, what are you doing？ - I'm sorry, Mr. President.

935
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:24,120
我必须问您个问题，但我知道 只有我们俩独处时您才会回答
{\fs10}I need to ask you a question, which I know you can't answer unless we're alone.

936
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,490
我们两个进来了！
{\fs10}Two coming in！

937
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:30,750
我要一把锤子，一把铁撬 还要一台凿石机
{\fs10}I want a sledgehammer, I want a crowbar, I want a jackhammer, now！

938
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,290
汤姆，通知副总统
{\fs10}Tom, alert the vice president.

939
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,100
总统先生，1880年至今
{\fs10}Mr. President, sometime between 1880,

940
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:41,270
坚定之桌搬入总统办公室后
{\fs10}when the Resolute desk was placed in the Oval Office,

941
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:45,830
我国有一位总统发现书桌里的秘密夹层
{\fs10}and now, one of our presidents found a secret compartment in the desk.

942
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:49,680
夹层里有一块写有 印第安人土著文字的木板
{\fs10}Hidden inside was a plank with Native American writing on it.

943
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:54,520
那是传说中的黄金城――锡沃拉的藏宝图
{\fs10}A treasure map to Cibola, the legendary City of Gold, sir.

944
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,920
你千辛万苦，只是想问我藏宝图？
{\fs10}All this just to ask me about a treasure map？

945
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:00,390
藏宝图是证明托马斯・盖茨清白的关键
{\fs10}That map is a key to proving Thomas Gates' innocence.

946
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:04,690
我知道那木板已经不在坚定之桌里了
{\fs10}I know for a fact that the plank is no longer in the Resolute desk.

947
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,290
你已经拜访过我的桌子了？
{\fs10}You've been in my desk too？

948
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:09,430
我知道那块木板的下落
{\fs10}I believe the whereabouts of that plank is now hidden…

949
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:12,290
就藏在总统秘卷中
{\fs10}…in the President's Book, sir.

950
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,300
那秘卷只有总统才能看
{\fs10}The book known only to our presidents.

951
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,900
秘卷里有所有的国家机密
{\fs10}It contains all of our nation's secrets.

952
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,450
我从没听过比这更荒唐的事情
{\fs10}That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

953
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:34,390
我看过书桌里的徽章 这说明地图的确存在
{\fs10}I saw the seal in the desk, sir. I know the map exists.

954
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,450
你不打算告诉我怎么出去…
{\fs10}You're not going to tell me how to get out of here

955
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:41,900
- 除非你达到目的 - 出去的路就往那边走
{\fs10}- unless you get what you want. - The way out is that direction,

956
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:43,800
我会带您出去的
{\fs10}and I'll show you.

957
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:45,930
你不太会谈判，对吧？
{\fs10}You don't negotiate very well, do you？

958
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:48,200
不懂，先生
{\fs10}No, sir.

959
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,000
总统先生？
{\fs10}Mr. President！

960
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,770
我要的锤子呢？
{\fs10}Where are my sledgehammers？

961
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:58,910
我不明白，盖茨
{\fs10}I don't get you, Gates.

962
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:01,820
你这么做，甚至为此甘愿去坐牢
{\fs10}You do all this, you're willing to go to prison,

963
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:04,190
就为了洗刷你祖先的名声
{\fs10}just to clear your ancestor's name.

964
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:07,320
走下阶梯就能出去
{\fs10}The way out is just down those stairs.

965
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:11,500
没有先人，就没有现在的我
{\fs10}Everything I am is because of my ancestors, sir.

966
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,060
托马斯・盖茨对他的祖国献出满腔热血
{\fs10}Thomas Gates gave his last full measure of devotion

967
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:17,730
以阻止金环骑士会的阴谋
{\fs10}to his country to stop the KGC.

968
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,600
当一个人为国捐躯时 我相信他该受到赞扬
{\fs10}When someone dies for their country, I believe they should be honored.

969
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:23,540
“献出满腔热血？”
{\fs10}"Last full measure of devotion"？

970
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:27,080
林肯是我最喜欢的总统 我没有冒犯您的意思
{\fs10}Lincoln is my favorite president, sir. No offense.

971
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:31,650
没关系，他也是我心中的英雄
{\fs10}None taken. He's my favorite too.

972
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:36,650
我知道有这本书，问题是…
{\fs10}Sir, I know the book exists, and my question is,

973
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,090
能否同意让我一观？
{\fs10}"Will you agree to let me see it？"

974
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:43,420
如果那种东西真的存在
{\fs10}Even if something like that really did exist,

975
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,400
凭什么认为我会给你看？
{\fs10}why do you think I would actually just give it to you？

976
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,860
因为这可能会指引我们
{\fs10}Because it will probably lead us

977
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:53,030
发现史上最大的印第安宝藏
{\fs10}to the discovery of the greatest Native American treasure of all time.

978
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:56,670
一块巨大的文化空白
{\fs10}A huge piece of culture lost.

979
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:59,840
你可以将那段历史交还给它的后代们
{\fs10}You can give that history back to its descendants.

980
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:04,080
而且因为您是美国总统，先生
{\fs10}And because you're the president of the United States, sir.

981
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:09,020
无论是您内在的人格，捍卫宪法的誓言
{\fs10}Whether by innate character, or the oath you took to defend the Constitution,

982
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:11,990
还是肩头的历史重任，您都会这么做的
{\fs10}or the weight of history that falls upon you.

983
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:15,590
我相信您是位可敬的人，先生
{\fs10}I believe you to be an honorable man, sir.

984
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:20,000
人民已经不相信这些东西了
{\fs10}People don't believe that stuff anymore.

985
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,530
他们愿意相信
{\fs10}They want to believe it.

986
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:50,560
最近的公路在那边，恕我无法与您同路了
{\fs10}Nearest highway is that direction. You'll understand if we part ways here.

987
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:57,930
- 盖茨 - 先生
{\fs10}- Gates. - Sir？

988
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,060
我下面要讲的话，你就当从没听过
{\fs10}The following conversation never happened.

989
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,910
那本书的确存在
{\fs10}The book exists.

990
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,510
- 在哪里？ - 你会把书放在哪里？
{\fs10}- Where is it？ - Where else do you keep a book？

991
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:09,410
就在国会图书馆
{\fs10}In the Library of Congress.

992
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:14,850
X，Y，2，3，4，7，8，6
{\fs10}X, Y, two, three, four, seven, eight, six.

993
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:16,210
谢谢你，先生
{\fs10}Thank you, sir.

994
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:22,090
还得记住3，7，9，4
{\fs10}You'll also need to know three, seven, nine, four.

995
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,460
知道了
{\fs10}Got it.

996
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:28,160
- 盖茨 - 先生
{\fs10}- And, Gates… - Sir？

997
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:33,540
有两百人知道你绑架了我 我无法告诉他们原因
{\fs10}Two hundred people know you held me against my will. I can't tell them why.

998
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,940
除非你找到你需要的东西
{\fs10}Unless you find what you're looking for,

999
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:38,810
你会被控绑架总统的罪名
{\fs10}you'll be charged with kidnapping the president.

1000
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,250
- 你知道那意味着什么 - 是的，非常清楚
{\fs10}- You know what that means. - Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.

1001
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,780
- 我要你帮我做件事 - 这是我的荣幸
{\fs10}- I want you to do something for me. - It would be a privilege, sir.

1002
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:55,680
第47页，好好看看
{\fs10}Page 47. Just have a look at that.

1003
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:02,130
莱利，国会图书馆，20分钟后见
{\fs10}Riley, meet me at the Library of Congress in 20 minutes.

1004
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:05,830
好
{\fs10}OK.

1005
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,100
我是萨德斯基
{\fs10}Sadusky.

1006
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:19,650
总统他…怎么了？
{\fs10}The president's been what？

1007
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,010
是盖茨
{\fs10}Gates.

1008
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:30,620
XY234786
{\fs10}X- Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1009
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:35,100
XY234786…XY234786…
{\fs10}X- Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six. X- Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1010
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:36,790
- 嘿 - 你好
{\fs10}- Hey. - Hey.

1011
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,570
谜底就在眼前
{\fs10}We're close.

1012
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:52,140
- 我们从哪儿开始？ - XY是图书分类号
{\fs10}- Where do we start？ - XY is the book classification code.

1013
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:55,710
XY代表特别类，就是非常珍贵的书籍
{\fs10}Stands for special collections, which means very special books.

1014
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:58,760
- 这些书在哪儿？ - 这边走，我们得偷偷溜进去
{\fs10}- Where are they？ - This way. We'll sneak in.

1015
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:22,700
这下好了
{\fs10}This will be good.

1016
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:28,140
到了，XA…XM…
{\fs10}Here we go. XA… XM…

1017
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:36,590
看这儿，你有密码吗？
{\fs10}Look. Do you have a code？

1018
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,090
3-7-9-4
{\fs10}Three-seven-nine-four.

1019
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:48,770
总统说书目号是多少？
{\fs10}What did the president say the number was？

1020
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,070
是234786
{\fs10}Two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1021
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,140
2-3-6-7…
{\fs10}Two-three-six-seven…

1022
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:04,280
XY233，2378…在这儿
{\fs10}X- Y-two-three-three, two-three-seven-eight… Here.

{\fs10}- Two-three-four-seven-nine… - Seventy-six, 78…

1024
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,360
不在这里
{\fs10}It's not there.

1025
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,960
可能有人借出去了
{\fs10}Maybe someone checked it out.

1026
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,770
- 既然没书，他为什么叫我们来？ - 也许他是想让我们被捕
{\fs10}- Why send us here if there's no book？ - He probably wanted us to get caught.

1027
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:31,570
看这儿
{\fs10}Here.

1028
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:51,000
- 什么东西 - 六位数字锁
{\fs10}- What is that？ - It's a six-dial combination lock.

1029
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,970
书目号就是密码
{\fs10}The location is the combination.

1030
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:58,110
书目号就是密码…
{\fs10}The location is the combination.

1031
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,230
我说的没错吧
{\fs10}Yes. I was right.

1032
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,530
干得好，普尔先生
{\fs10}Well done, Mr. Poole.

1033
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:28,300
鹰和卷轴
{\fs10}Eagle and the scroll.

1034
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:42,610
- 51区… - 嘘！
{\fs10}- Area 51！ - Shh！

1035
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,250
- 是肯尼迪刺杀案… - 嘘！没时间看这些
{\fs10}- Kennedy assassination. - Shh！ We don't have time.

1036
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:50,350
对，那倒是真的
{\fs10}Yeah, it's true.

1037
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:56,030
这个，等等
{\fs10}Here. Wait.

1038
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:00,270
1865年4月，维多利亚女王给派克发了两封密码信函
{\fs10}"April 1865. Queen Victoria sends Pike two coded missives.

1039
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:04,810
第一封信打开后，里面的信息…
{\fs10}The first is received. Contains information regarding

1040
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,280
是有关新大陆宝藏的，黄金之城！
{\fs10}New World treasure. The City of Gold. "

1041
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,250
等等，女王想要帮南部邦联的忙？
{\fs10}Wait. The queen wanted to help the Confederacy？

1042
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,950
- 分裂的美国更容易对付 - 英国需要南方的棉花
{\fs10}- A divided America'd have been weaker. - Needed cotton from the South.

1043
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:19,180
第二封信据信写有普莱费厄密码
{\fs10}"The second missive was thought to contain a Playfair cipher

1044
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:23,190
建议与拉布莱伊联系 他死前会将线索埋藏起来
{\fs10}suggesting contact with Laboulaye, who'll hide clues before his death. "

1045
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:26,990
那就是布斯日记里写的密码 也是托马斯想烧掉的
{\fs10}The cipher written into the Booth diary page that Thomas tried to burn.

1046
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:29,360
- 就是我们发现的那个 - 没错，1880年…
{\fs10}- The one we have. - Exactly. "1880.

1047
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:34,330
坚定之桌抵达华盛顿 作为女王送给海斯总统的礼物
{\fs10}Resolute desk arrives in Washington, sent by queen to President Hayes. "

1048
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,360
看这个
{\fs10}Look at that.

1049
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:42,410
白宫失踪的木板，哇哦
{\fs10}Missing plank from the White House. Wow.

1050
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,940

1052
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,850
留下照片后，木板被摧毁
{\fs10}Plank photographed and then destroyed.

1053
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:57,730
并委派博格鲁姆去摧毁地标
{\fs10}Borglum commissioned to destroy landmarks

1054
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:59,920
地点在神圣的黑岗山
{\fs10}in sacred Black Hills mountains. "

1055
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:06,160
博格鲁姆？和拉什莫尔山有关系嘛？{\fs12}（拉什莫尔山：即著名的总统山，刻有4名总统的头像）
{\fs10}Borglum. Mount Rushmore？

1056
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:11,830
他在拉什莫尔山上雕刻 是为了抹去地图上的地标
{\fs10}He carved Mount Rushmore to erase the map's landmarks

1057
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:14,380
从而保护黄金之城
{\fs10}in order to protect the City of Gold.

1058
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:18,040
拉什莫尔山竟然是个幌子
{\fs10}Mount Rushmore was a cover-up.

1059
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,880
什么声音？
{\fs10}What is it？

1060
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:25,860
那些领我税金的家伙要来捉我了
{\fs10}There's my tax dollars at work, coming to arrest me.

1061
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,550
他们是来捉我的，快去开车
{\fs10}Not coming for you, they're for me. Go to the car.

1062
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:30,530
- 不 - 快去，我会同你们会合的
{\fs10}- No！ - Go！ I'll meet up with you.

1063
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,090
往这儿走
{\fs10}This way.

1064
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:43,340
盖茨先是绑架了总统，然后又放了他
{\fs10}So Gates abducts the president, lets him go

1065
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:45,400
随后就来到了国会图书馆？
{\fs10}and heads to the Library of Congress？

1066
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:48,110
- 为什么？ - 可能他想借本书看看
{\fs10}- Why？ - Maybe he wants to check out a book.

1067
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:09,090
这边
{\fs10}This way.

1068
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:32,460
所有探员注意…
{\fs10}All agents…

1069
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:47,000
- 爸爸 - 本
{\fs10}- Dad. - Ben.

1070
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:49,340
快点出来，我得把车开走了
{\fs10}Get out of there. I had to move the car.

1071
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:51,810
满大街都是FBI和特勤局的人
{\fs10}FBI, Secret Service all over the place.

1072
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,640
别慌，我先把木板的照片发到你手机上
{\fs10}Calm down. I sent a picture of the plank to your cell.

1073
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:56,650
- 你能把照片发过来？ - 对，我能
{\fs10}- You can do that？ - Yes, I can do that.

1074
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:58,380
收到照片了吗？
{\fs10}Did you get it？

1075
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:00,520
- 收到了 - 看
{\fs10}- I got it. - Look.

1076
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:06,280
- 拿去给妈妈翻译 - 为什么让我去？
{\fs10}- Take it to Mom for translation. - Why me？

1077
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,420
他说他妈妈可以翻译木板？
{\fs10}He say his mom could translate the plank？

1078
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:10,390
查查她的底细
{\fs10}Find out who she is.

1079
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:24,340
- 我们怎么去找本？ - 不知道
{\fs10}- How are we going to find Ben？ - I don't know.

1080
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:26,310
- 站住！你们是谁？ - 我们是工作人员
{\fs10}- Hold it！ Who are you？ - We work here.

1081
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:28,570
- 身份卡 - 拿去，有人叫我们疏散
{\fs10}- IDs. - Here. We were told to evacuate.

1082
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:30,340
我不知道里面发生了什么事
{\fs10}I don't know what's going on.

1083
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:33,010
- 我的车停在… - 前一秒我还在看书…
{\fs10}- My car's parked… - One second I'm reading…

1084
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:36,580
- 一个特别的区域… - 转眼间就被赶了出来…
{\fs10}- Special section for… … a book, then we're rushed out…

1085
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:38,210
- 走吧 - 谢谢
{\fs10}- Go ahead. - OK. Thank you.

1086
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:41,380
- 遇见人最好拿出身份卡，祝你们好运 - 多谢你的帮助，警官
{\fs10}- Thank you for your help, officer. - Best of luck.

1087
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:44,690
晚安
{\fs10}Have a good night.

1088
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:51,530
到东北区去…
{\fs10}Hey, go to the northeast sectors…

1089
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:56,340
发动引擎
{\fs10}Start the car.

1090
01:18:59,410 --> 01:19:00,570
挂好排档
{\fs10}Put it in gear.

1091
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,520
怎么回事？
{\fs10}- Uh-oh. - What's the problem？

1092
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:05,710
没问题，快开车
{\fs10}It's clear. Let's go！

1093
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,620
我们会坐牢的
{\fs10}We're going to jail.

1094
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,490
我要检查一下…
{\fs10}I want to run a check…

1095
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:16,690
进来，抓稳
{\fs10}Get in！ Hang on！

1096
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:19,530
一辆奔驰SUV…
{\fs10}Mercedes SUV…

1097
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,160
- 他上来了，快开车！ - 抓稳了！
{\fs10}- He's in！ Go！ - Hang on！

1098
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,230
好，我们能行的
{\fs10}OK. We can do this.

1099
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,570
升起路障，封住出口！
{\fs10}Close the barricade, lock it down！

1100
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,740
封住出口！
{\fs10}Lock it down！

1101
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:39,280
- 快开，快开 - 好
{\fs10}- Drive, drive, drive！ - OK.

1102
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:43,110
不行！
{\fs10}I don't think so！

1103
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,830
快！快！快！
{\fs10}Go, go, go, go, go！

1104
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,160
快走！快点！
{\fs10}Let's go！ Let's go！

1105
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:59,230
这跟计划中的不一样！
{\fs10}That did not turn out the way it was supposed to！

1106
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,970
- 他们怎么这么快就找到我们了？ - 我来告诉你是怎么回事
{\fs10}- How'd they find us so quick？ - I'll tell you how.

1107
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:05,700
- 总统他打了小报告！ - 是萨德斯基，刚才在图书馆见到他了
{\fs10}- The president is a tattletale！ - Sadusky. He was there.

1108
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:08,110
关于那本书，看来他知道不少
{\fs10}He knows more about the book than I thought.

1109
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:10,870
被人绑架，总统先生他感觉如何啊？
{\fs10}How'd the president feel about being kidnapped？

1110
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:12,540
还行吧
{\fs10}He was OK.

1111
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,890
- 阿普尔顿博士 - 办公室已经关门了，不好意思
{\fs10}- Dr. Appleton. - This office is closed. I'm sorry.

1112
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,430
抱歉这么晚打扰
{\fs10}I do apologize for the lateness of the hour.

1113
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,990
我的名字是米奇・威尔金森
{\fs10}My name is Mitch Wilkinson.

1114
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:31,700
我想让你看个东西，很快就好
{\fs10}I've got something I want you to take a look at. Just take a minute.

1115
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,780
- 你是宝藏猎人 - 不，女士
{\fs10}- You're a treasure hunter. - No, ma'am.

1116
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:44,610
我只是一个想青史留名的人
{\fs10}I'm just a man trying to make his mark on history.

1117
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:46,480
能帮我吗？
{\fs10}Can you help me？

1118
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:52,150
我不懂那种语言，抱歉，帮不上忙
{\fs10}Um… No, I don't know that language. I'm sorry. I can't help you.

1119
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,780
请原谅
{\fs10}Oh, excuse me.

1120
01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:59,020
对
{\fs10}Yes.

1121
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:02,100
知道了
{\fs10}Got it.

1122
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:06,470
你的前夫正在路上，他也想要你的翻译
{\fs10}Your ex-husband's on his way up. He wants the translation.

1123
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:13,070
不许告诉他真相，甩开他 否则他的命就难保了
{\fs10}Tell him anything but the truth. Get rid of him. His life depends on it.

1124
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,280
艾米丽？
{\fs10}Emily？

1125
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,230
我知道你最不想见的人就是我
{\fs10}I know I'm the last person you want to see,

1126
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:44,570
我也觉得很别扭，但我们需要你翻译点东西
{\fs10}and I'm not comfortable either, but we need you to translate something.

1127
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:50,580
- 本让我来的，他需要你帮忙 - 那没问题
{\fs10}- Ben sent me. He needs your help. - Yes, of course.

1128
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:53,880
如果是本，就没问题，是什么东西？
{\fs10}If it's for Ben, of course. What is it？

1129
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,120
在手机里，我不知道怎么…
{\fs10}It's in the cell phone. I'm not sure how to…

1130
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:02,180
- 给我 - …把图片调出来
{\fs10}- Give it to me. … bring it out.

1131
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:12,470
我们知道这地方应该在拉什莫尔山附近
{\fs10}We know it leads to Mount Rushmore.

1132
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:19,740
对，“岛…草之海中，石之岛耸”
{\fs10}Yes. "Islands… Islands of stone in a sea of grass. "

1133
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:24,440
那是拉科塔土著用来称呼 南达科他州的黑岗山
{\fs10}That's what the Lakota used to call the Black Hills in South Dakota.

1134
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:26,140
嗯
{\fs10}Right.

1135
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:33,830
“月侵地处，蜂鸟翼舒”
{\fs10}"Find where the moon touches the earth and release the hummingbird. "

1136
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,460
只有这些？
{\fs10}That's it？

1137
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:51,410
你有没有想过…？没想到我会说出来
{\fs10}Did it ever occur to you？ I can't believe I'm saying this.

1138
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:56,550
你有没有想过 我做那些事是为了引你注意？
{\fs10}Did it ever occur to you that I did the things I did to impress you？

1139
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:03,190
不，你只是自己想做，而我也会做同样的事
{\fs10}No, you did it because you wanted to, and I would've done the same thing,

1140
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:06,590
只是我们有人得负责养家育儿
{\fs10}except one of us had to grow up and stay home and look after Ben.

1141
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:08,650
当然那绝对不是你
{\fs10}Certainly wasn't going to be you.

1142
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:13,990
你有没有想过，是我做出你做不来的牺牲？
{\fs10}Did it ever occur to you that I made sacrifices for us that you never did？

1143
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,160
肯定没有
{\fs10}No, of course not.

1144
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,470
你还是走吧
{\fs10}So just go away.

1145
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:36,040
可恶的龙舌兰酒
{\fs10}Lousy tequila.

1146
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:42,860
别再沮丧了，你做得很好
{\fs10}Don't feel bad. You did good.

1147
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:44,990
帕特里克对你的话深信不疑
{\fs10}Patrick believed every word you said.

1148
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:48,630
而且，你儿子他找不到宝藏的
{\fs10}Besides, your son would have never found the treasure anyway.

1149
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,530
你不了解本杰明
{\fs10}You don't know Benjamin.

1150
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:54,170
也许我不了解，但是我有这个
{\fs10}Perhaps not. But then again, I have this.

1151
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:02,680
维多利亚女王写给南军将领派克的信？
{\fs10}A letter from Queen Victoria to the Confederate General Albert Pike？

1152
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:07,020
我们的女王似乎更偏爱南部邦联
{\fs10}Seems the dear old queen was partial to the Confederate cause.

1153
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,660
这封信在我的家族中已经传承了140年
{\fs10}This has been handed down by my family for 140 years.

1154
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:15,790
里面有最重要的信息，也是最后的线索
{\fs10}Contains a vital piece of information. The final clue, as it were.

1155
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:21,730
若没有你的翻译，这条信息毫无价值
{\fs10}This piece of information is worthless without your translation of the planks.

1156
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,000
真是讽刺啊
{\fs10}It's ironic, isn't it？

1157
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:29,840
一切都从烧毁一页纸开始
{\fs10}This all began with the burning of pages, and now it ends

1158
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:33,440
结局却是烧毁这个最终的线索
{\fs10}with the burning of this, the final clue.

1159
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,010
让我成为唯一
{\fs10}Making me the only one…

1160
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:38,710
能找到锡沃拉的人
{\fs10}…who can find Cibola.

1161
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:42,050
带上外套
{\fs10}Get your coat.

1162
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:57,930
就她对第二块板子的翻译来看
{\fs10}Her translation on the second half of the planks says

1163
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,570
- 我们要找的是一个石之岛 - 本应该已经找到了
{\fs10}- we need to find an island of stone. - Ben would have found it by now.

1164
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:03,240
我不这么认为
{\fs10}I don't think so.

1165
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:12,880
怎么才能到这里…
{\fs10}How do I get to, um, this…

1166
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:15,980
你好，米奇
{\fs10}Hello, Mitch.

1167
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:18,720
妈妈…
{\fs10}Mom…

1168
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:21,660
- 等我一下 - 没门，你太慢啦
{\fs10}- Wait for me. - No way. You're too slow.

1169
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,990
我跟你爸说的那些话，我就知道你能明白的
{\fs10}I knew you'd figure out the message I gave your father.

1170
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:28,370
“蜂鸟”这谜语真不错…放了她，米奇{\fs12}（关于蜂鸟之谜的猜测，请看片尾字幕）
{\fs10}The hummingbird was good. Let her go.

1171
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:32,170
枪在我们手上，轮不到你发号施令
{\fs10}We're the ones with the firepower, and you're giving me orders.

1172
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:36,510
我绑架了总统，FBI现在正抓我呢
{\fs10}I kidnapped the president. The FBI is on their way right now to arrest me,

1173
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:38,600
相信他们见到你会很高兴的
{\fs10}and I'm sure they'll love to meet you.

1174
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,810
他们会找到我们两个，然后拿出两付手铐
{\fs10}They'll find us both and arrest us both.

1175
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,610
顺着那条路可没法走到黄金之城，对吧？
{\fs10}That path doesn't lead to the City of Gold, does it？

1176
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:46,750
这个人身上有你需要的线索，他有封信
{\fs10}This man has information you need. He's got a letter.

1177
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:49,190
维多利亚女王给阿尔伯特・派克将军的信
{\fs10}From Queen Victoria to General Albert Pike.

1178
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:52,120
- 你怎么知道？ - 我从一本书里看到的
{\fs10}- How do you know that？ - I read about it, in a book.

1179
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,660
那封信他已经烧掉了
{\fs10}I'm afraid he's burned it.

1180
01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:04,670
好吧…你让我做了这么多 为何现在却要半途而废呢？
{\fs10}All right… You've had me do all the work so far, why stop now？

1181
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:08,640
把你知道的告诉我，我去找黄金之城
{\fs10}You tell me what you know, I'll find the City of Gold,

1182
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:11,940
只要能证明托马斯・盖茨的清白，宝藏归你
{\fs10}prove Thomas Gates' innocence, you can have the treasure.

1183
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:13,910
- 什么？ - 我跟你一起去
{\fs10}- What？ - I'm going with you.

1184
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:17,750
但如果别人问起黄金之城是谁发现的
{\fs10}But if anyone's gonna be credited for discovering the City of Gold,

1185
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:19,080
答案只有一个，那就是我
{\fs10}it's going to be me.

1186
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:22,250
但你的同伙都得留在这儿，不许带枪
{\fs10}But your partners stay here, and all the guns.

1187
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,980
凭什么觉得我会同意这条件？
{\fs10}What makes you think I'd agree？

1188
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:29,420
因为你需要这笔财宝，这一点我很清楚
{\fs10}Because you need that treasure. Believe me, I know.

1189
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,230
好吧，我们按你说的做
{\fs10}All right, Gates. We'll do it your way.

1190
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:43,010
但是相信我…带没带枪，对我都一样
{\fs10}But believe me… I don't need the guns.

1191
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:51,750
- 哪个总统？美国总统？ - 我觉得还是不告诉你为好
{\fs10}- Which president？ The president？ - I thought it best not to tell you.

1192
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:08,730
我还是看不到什么尊鸟的影子
{\fs10}I still don't see anything that looks like a noble bird.

1193
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:12,640
好吧，告诉我们
{\fs10}All right. Let's have it.

1194
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:17,140
信上写了什么？女王的信有什么线索？
{\fs10}What did the letter say？ What's the clue from Queen Victoria's letter？

1195
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:22,510
无云之雨，出入之闾
{\fs10}"The entrance shall only be revealed under a cloudless rain. "

1196
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:24,170
来解解看这个谜语吧
{\fs10}Figure that one out.

1197
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:27,880
我们等下雨的时候再来？
{\fs10}So we come back when it's raining？

1198
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:33,720
无云可能指的就是太阳
{\fs10}"Cloudless. " Could simply mean the sun.

1199
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:37,390
在晴天的时候…下雨
{\fs10}You need a sunny day… and rain.

1200
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:39,750
我们用水造雨
{\fs10}We need water.

1201
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,660
水
{\fs10}Water.

1202
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:53,440
阿比盖尔
{\fs10}Abigail.

1203
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:58,050
各位，水会让石头颜色变深，用水浇石头
{\fs10}Everybody, the water makes the rocks darker. Use the water.

1204
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:59,350
艾米丽？要水么？
{\fs10}Em？ Water？

1205
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:03,520
- 我手上的是什么？你没长眼睛啊？ - 好，好
{\fs10}- What's this in my hand？ Are you blind？ - Good, good, good.

1206
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:18,800
太可笑了，要把水洒遍这座山？
{\fs10}This is ridiculous. Are we going to water the whole thing？

1207
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:29,920
就是这个
{\fs10}That's it.

1208
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:34,580
这是这个！我找到了，这边，这边！
{\fs10}Oh！ That's it. I found it. Over here！ Found it！ Over here！

1209
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:37,920
看看
{\fs10}Look at this！

1210
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:40,520
一只鹰
{\fs10}It's an eagle.

1211
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:45,120
- 看啊，是一只鹰 - 还真有哎
{\fs10}- Look at that. It's an eagle. - There it is.

1212
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:48,360
- “尊鸟有缘…” - “路在眼前”
{\fs10}- "The noble bird… " - "Will give you passage. "

1213
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,930
- 现在怎么办？ - 我们应该手拉手…
{\fs10}- Uh-huh. Now what？ - We need to join hands,

1214
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:56,910
摆出优雅高贵的姿态，走过这只鸟
{\fs10}and in a noble manner, pass over the bird.

1215
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:01,570
- 也许它指示了方向… - 也许这鸟就会…
{\fs10}- It indicates direction… - Somehow that bird…

1216
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:05,480
从石头上飞起，然后哑哑鸣叫…
{\fs10}…will rise from the rock and kind of caw…

1217
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:09,780
你们要么继续胡猜瞎蒙 要么听我道出下一个线索
{\fs10}You can stand around guessing for a while, or I can give you the next clue.

1218
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:13,960
“勇士心上，举手示降”
{\fs10}"Surrender your hand to the heart of the warrior. "

1219
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,830
鹰就是勇士的标志
{\fs10}And the eagle is a symbol of the warrior.

1220
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,430
本，别，等等，先别伸手
{\fs10}Ben, no. Wait, wait！ No.

1221
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:28,200
这可能是个可怕的陷阱，快告诉他！
{\fs10}That's probably a horrible trap. Tell him！

1222
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:29,830
这是个可怕的陷阱
{\fs10}It's a horrible trap.

1223
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:33,540
都已经到门口了，还不试试，太可惜了
{\fs10}It would be a pity to come this far and not even try, now, wouldn't it？

1224
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,250
我来吧，本
{\fs10}I'll do it, Ben.

1225
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:37,870
没关系
{\fs10}It's OK.

1226
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:44,290
举手示降…
{\fs10}Surrender your hand.

1227
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:04,400
- 不好意思，我…我实在忍不住 - 你…
{\fs10}- I am sorry. I… I couldn't resist. - You！

1228
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:10,100
摸起来好像是个门拴
{\fs10}Lt, uh… feels like a latch.

1229
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:20,650
看看
{\fs10}Look at this.

1230
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:35,340
好，走吧
{\fs10}All right, good. Let's go.

1231
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:03,140
本，过来看看这个
{\fs10}Ben, look at this.

1232
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,200
太漂亮了！
{\fs10}Oh, that's beautiful！

1233
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:13,040
- 帕特里克！ - 本，那是什么？
{\fs10}- Patrick. Patrick！ - Ben, what is that？

1234
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:16,100
像是个砝码，为保持平衡，不让门关上
{\fs10}Appears to be a counterweight to hold the door open.

1235
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:18,280
什么声音？
{\fs10}What is that sound？

1236
01:31:18,350 --> 01:31:19,680
太迷人了
{\fs10}Fascinating.

1237
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:26,650
本！
{\fs10}Ben！

1238
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:38,400
对不起
{\fs10}Sorry.

1239
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:40,060
- 还好吧？ - 不好
{\fs10}- You OK？ - No.

1240
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:41,530
起来
{\fs10}Get up.

1241
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,370
锁住了
{\fs10}It's locked.

1242
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:49,210
- 帕特里克，瞧你都干了什么？ - 门闩自己合上了，不是我干的
{\fs10}- Patrick, what have you done？ - Some kind of a bolt. I didn't do it.

1243
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,250
只有一种出去的方法了
{\fs10}Only one way out of here now.

1244
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:54,550
往前走
{\fs10}Forward.

1245
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:09,530
从没看到过这么多文物
{\fs10}Never seen so many relics.

1246
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,700
保存如此完好
{\fs10}So beautifully preserved.

1247
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,700
各位，看来我们得把这些石头搬走
{\fs10}Looks like we're going to be moving some rocks.

1248
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:21,210
- 那后面有个通道 - 都来看看这个
{\fs10}- There's a tunnel back in through here. - Guys, look at this.

1249
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,770
小金人
{\fs10}It's a little golden man.

1250
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:33,220
看，它的身体特别小，看啊，他好像…
{\fs10}Look. It's got a tiny little torso. Look at that. It looks like…

1251
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:48,170
- 本！ - 本！
{\fs10}- Ben！ - Ben！

1252
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:57,180
后退，后退，你们都到另外一边去！
{\fs10}Move back！ Move back！ All of you！ Other side！

1253
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,250
后退！
{\fs10}Back up！ Back up！

1254
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:09,600
莱利，往前，往前！
{\fs10}Riley, move forward！ Move forward！

1255
01:33:10,730 --> 01:33:12,200
不，退后，退后！
{\fs10}No, back up, back up.

1256
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:16,430
- 你要我干嘛？ - 停，停下！
{\fs10}- What you want me to do？ - Stop！ Stop！

1257
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:23,840
我们得控制重心，这块板才不会翻
{\fs10}We have to balance our weight to even this thing out.

1258
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:29,070
- 我们会找到他们的 - 我们怎么办？
{\fs10}- We'll find 'em. - What are we gonna do？

1259
01:33:29,150 --> 01:33:31,880
- 我有个主意，我告诉你该怎么办 - 不，我有个主意
{\fs10}Figure something out. Tell you what we're going to do.

1260
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:34,320
不，让我来说
{\fs10}- No, I'll tell you. - No. I'll tell you！

1261
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:37,220
不，让我来说！那里有个通道
{\fs10}No, I'll tell you！ There's that passageway.

1262
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:41,560
你去把那些石头搬开，那肯定通向什么地方
{\fs10}You go, pull those stones out, because that leads somewhere.

1263
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:43,750
真是一个好主意
{\fs10}That is a good idea.

1264
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:50,430
下面没东西，只有一个黑乎乎的大洞
{\fs10}There's nothing. Just a big old black hole.

1265
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:56,810
本，看那儿！有个梯子
{\fs10}Ben, look！ There's a ladder.

1266
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,940
- 我的意思是，至少以前是个梯子 - 手电扔给我
{\fs10}- I mean, what's left of a ladder. - Toss me the light.

1267
01:34:03,450 --> 01:34:07,350
莱利，慢慢移动到那个角上，不，等下…
{\fs10}Riley. Move slowly to that corner. No！ Wait. Just…

1268
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:10,550
- 等我往这个角上移的时候你再移 - 好
{\fs10}- As I move to this corner. - OK.

1269
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:14,190
一次一步，很好
{\fs10}One step at a time. Good.

1270
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,690
如果能让这一角升高点，我应该能够到
{\fs10}If we can raise this corner, I think I'll reach it.

1271
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:27,500
- 停！红灯！ - 你在帮倒忙！
{\fs10}- Stop！ Red light！ - You're not helping！

1272
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:29,630
我像你一样，也可以够得到
{\fs10}I can get up there just as easy as you.

1273
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:32,870
先停下
{\fs10}Just stop.

1274
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:36,510
- 你们！ - 这里是三对一
{\fs10}- Guys！ - It's three against one here.

1275
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:40,250
我不愿最后走，既然如此 那不妨让我最先走
{\fs10}I ain't going last, and if I'm not going last, I might as well go first.

1276
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:42,610
听着
{\fs10}Look！

1277
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:47,080
怎么样？
{\fs10}What's it gonna be？

1278
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:58,300
我们按你说的做
{\fs10}We'll do this your way.

1279
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:16,220
其他人，听我数三声，然后聚拢
{\fs10}The rest of us, on my count of three, all move together.

1280
01:35:16,290 --> 01:35:17,780
一次一步
{\fs10}One step at a time.

1281
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:21,650
一，二，三
{\fs10}One, two, three.

1282
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:42,610
- 准备好了？ - 走
{\fs10}- You ready？ - Go.

1283
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,470
米奇，你看到什么了？
{\fs10}Mitch, what do you see？

1284
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:21,340
是出去的路吗？
{\fs10}Is there a way out？

1285
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,480
上面是什么，米奇？
{\fs10}What's up there, Mitch？

1286
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:37,500
艾米丽？
{\fs10}Em？

1287
01:36:37,570 --> 01:36:43,010
- 你还好吗？ - 向我保证，他会没事的
{\fs10}- Are you all right？ - Just promise me he's gonna be OK.

1288
01:36:47,650 --> 01:36:48,740
好
{\fs10}All right.

1289
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:51,680
我们走
{\fs10}Let's go.

1290
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:55,150
米奇！快回答！
{\fs10}Mitch！ Come on！

1291
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,620
- 我刚才算过了… - 我知道
{\fs10}- I've been doing the math here, and… - I know.

1292
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:01,490
我们得留一个人在这儿
{\fs10}We're gonna have to leave one person behind.

1293
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,690
答应我，你们会回来找我
{\fs10}Promise you'll come back for me.

1294
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,490
我也会算啊
{\fs10}I can do the math too.

1295
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:09,560
- 那下一个该你上了 - 我最后走
{\fs10}- That makes you next. - I'll go last.

1296
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:15,760
“不，我们会想个其它办法的” “我们需要你，求你了，莱利”
{\fs10}"No, we'll figure something else out. " "We need you there. Please, Riley. "

1297
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:18,670
我开玩笑，你们走吧
{\fs10}I'm just kidding. Go.

1298
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:20,740
好…
{\fs10}OK…

1299
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:54,340
- 一…二…三！ - 走！
{\fs10}- One… two… three！ - Go！

1300
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:03,580
- 你干了什么？ - 什么也没干
{\fs10}- What are you doing？ - Nothing.

1301
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,190
我抓不到
{\fs10}I can't get it.

1302
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,230
走！现在就走！快！
{\fs10}Just go！ Go now！ Go！

1303
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:23,610
- 好，准备好了？ - 走！
{\fs10}- All right, ready？ - Now！

1304
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:27,710
莱利！ 抓紧了！
{\fs10}Riley！ Hang on！

1305
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:35,240
嘿，米奇，那雕像 本，我们发现了个金雕像
{\fs10}OK. Mitch, the idol. OK, Ben. We found a gold idol here！

1306
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:38,020
我们可以用雕像来平衡你的重量
{\fs10}We can roll it over to offset your weight！

1307
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:39,460
那就快点！
{\fs10}Then roll it！

1308
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:43,750
来了！
{\fs10}Here it comes！

1309
01:38:52,610 --> 01:38:54,000
快，本！
{\fs10}Come on, Ben！

1310
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,610
来，抓住我的手
{\fs10}Here！ Give me your hand！

1311
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:02,500
本！
{\fs10}Ben！

1312
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:04,770
谢谢，莱利
{\fs10}Thanks, Riley.

1313
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:09,920
在我见义勇为的时候为啥没有女孩旁观呢？
{\fs10}Why couldn't a girl see me do that？

1314
01:39:13,930 --> 01:39:17,730
- 你还好吗？ - 没事了，你安全了
{\fs10}- You all right？ - You're OK. You're OK. You're OK.

1315
01:39:20,030 --> 01:39:22,230
那么…往前走吧
{\fs10}So… forward.

1316
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:28,930
这是什么？
{\fs10}What is this？

1317
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:41,180
把你的灯放在这里
{\fs10}Put your light over there.

1318
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:45,620
你在干什么？
{\fs10}What are you doing？

1319
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:14,150
我什么也看不到！是不是到了？
{\fs10}I can't see anything！ Is this it？

1320
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:20,650
是油！
{\fs10}It's oil！

1321
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:03,170
是死路！没有出路！
{\fs10}It's a dead end！ There's no way out！

1322
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,300
我们得折回去！
{\fs10}We have to turn back！

1323
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:16,240
好
{\fs10}OK.

1324
01:41:18,850 --> 01:41:21,840
不不，帕特里克，这太疯狂了
{\fs10}No. No, Patrick, this is crazy.

1325
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:25,710
好了
{\fs10}OK.

1326
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:32,090
成功了
{\fs10}I got it！

1327
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:36,860
抓住你了！抓住你了！
{\fs10}I got you！ I got you！

1328
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,320
不能再往前了
{\fs10}There's no forward！

1329
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:12,530
不是往前，是往下！
{\fs10}It's not forward, it's down！

1330
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:18,030
这些水一定从某处排出去 不然就会淹满这里
{\fs10}All this water has to go out somewhere. Otherwise, it'd be filled up.

1331
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:30,410
来帮我推这个转盘！
{\fs10}Help me turn this wheel！

1332
01:43:03,690 --> 01:43:05,550
水是往下流的
{\fs10}The water's going down.

1333
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:57,370
那些是…艾米丽
{\fs10}It is… Em.

1334
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,470
艾米丽，艾米丽
{\fs10}Em. Em.

1335
01:44:06,690 --> 01:44:08,520
本！
{\fs10}Ben！ Hey！

1336
01:44:08,590 --> 01:44:12,890
爸爸！我们找到了！
{\fs10}Dad！ We found it！

1337
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:16,820
- 托马斯说得没错！ - 不，是你说得没错
{\fs10}- Thomas was right！ - No, you were right！

1338
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:25,470
对不起，我玷污了你先祖的美名
{\fs10}Sorry I smeared your great-great granddaddy's good name.

1339
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:28,100
但这可能是唯一能让你上钩的方法
{\fs10}Seemed like the only way to get you in on the hunt.

1340
01:44:28,170 --> 01:44:32,940
这机会能让威尔金森家族留名青史
{\fs10}But this was a chance for the Wilkinson family to make its mark on history,

1341
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:36,950
发现黄金之城，并被后世铭记
{\fs10}to find the City of Gold, to be remembered.

1342
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:11,080
刚才发生什么了？你爸爸担心死了
{\fs10}What happened to you？ Your father was worried sick about you.

1343
01:45:11,150 --> 01:45:13,520
她差点疯掉
{\fs10}She was frantic. She was frantic.

1344
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:17,920
爸爸，来的路上，你有没有看到…
{\fs10}Dad, coming through, did you happen to see？

1345
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:21,930
住手，你有看到可以出去的岔路吗？
{\fs10}Stop it. Coming through, did you see any branches that could lead out？

1346
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:25,990
没，都堵住了，连门口都回不去
{\fs10}No, it's all blocked. You can't even get back to the big, round stone door.

1347
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,020
你母亲去干什么
{\fs10}Where's your mother going？

1348
01:45:30,770 --> 01:45:33,970
亲爱的，亲爱的，看看这个
{\fs10}Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Have a look at this.

1349
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:35,130
- 什么？ - 看啊
{\fs10}- What？ - Look.

1350
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:37,610
有了这个，就能解读奥尔麦克的文字
{\fs10}This is gonna unlock the Olmec language.

1351
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:41,310
前哥伦布时期的美洲历史将变得豁然开朗
{\fs10}It's gonna give us incredible insight into pre-Columbian history.

1352
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,040
艾米丽
{\fs10}Em？

1353
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:47,710
- 开心吗？ - 嗯，开心
{\fs10}- You happy？ - Oh, yeah.

1354
01:45:48,690 --> 01:45:51,680
- 本，来看这个，来啊！ - 就是这个
{\fs10}- Ben！ Look at this！ Look！ - Oh, yeah.

1355
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:55,060
这是他们割喉取心{\fs12}（祭神）{\fs18}的地方
{\fs10}That's where they slit the throat, cut the heart out.

1356
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,470
- 什么声音？ - 听
{\fs10}- What was that？ - Listen.

1357
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:45,270
我要找个出口，所有的门都堵上了
{\fs10}I tried to find a way out. All those portals are blocked off！

1358
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:48,800
这些水总要从某个地方出去，我们会找到的
{\fs10}I'm telling you, all this water goes out somewhere. We'll find it.

1359
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,220
本，水往那儿流
{\fs10}Ben, there's a current！

1360
01:46:58,660 --> 01:47:01,720
跟着找！这里肯定有个中央排水口
{\fs10}Follow it！ There's got to be a central drain！

1361
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:03,890
就在我们脚下，就这儿！
{\fs10}It's under us. Right here！

1362
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:14,130
快！
{\fs10}Come on！

1363
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:17,570
我们走！进去！
{\fs10}Let's go！ Get in there！

1364
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:26,710
水位上升太快了！
{\fs10}The water's rising too fast！

1365
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:29,520
只要打开那道门，就不会被水淹死！
{\fs10}Let's get that door open so we don't all drown！

1366
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:49,400
本，水顺着斜坡下去了！是一条排水管道
{\fs10}Ben, it slopes down！ It's a drainage tunnel.

1367
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:52,240
把门打开后，水会充满通道的
{\fs10}It fills with water when you open the door！

1368
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:55,470
我们得找点东西顶在下面，让门开着
{\fs10}We need to find something to stick under it to keep it open！

1369
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:58,540
不，如果一直开着，这通道就会被淹
{\fs10}No, if it's open, this tunnel will stay flooded.

1370
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:01,310
我们必须先过去，然后把门关了
{\fs10}We've got to get to the other side and close the door.

1371
01:48:01,390 --> 01:48:03,120
帕特里克，艾米丽，走！
{\fs10}Patrick, Emily, go！

1372
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:09,550
- 不！ - 不！
{\fs10}- No. - No！

1373
01:48:11,130 --> 01:48:12,120
不！
{\fs10}No！

1374
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:14,960
米奇，我们得到门的另一边去！
{\fs10}Mitch, we got to be on the other side of that door！

1375
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,300
除非我同意，否则谁都不准走
{\fs10}Nobody leaves unless I say so.

1376
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:21,360
门不会自己一直开着
{\fs10}That door is not gonna stay open by itself.

1377
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,670
接下去该怎么做，你我都明白
{\fs10}We both know what has to happen here.

1378
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:27,580
为了让门开着，我们中的一个得留在后面
{\fs10}One of us keeps the door open and stays behind.

1379
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:30,640
我投米奇一票
{\fs10}I vote Mitch.

1380
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:33,650
这不是民主表决
{\fs10}This isn't a democracy.

1381
01:48:38,290 --> 01:48:42,250
停手！我留下！我留下好了！看着！
{\fs10}Stop！ I'll stay！ I'm staying. Look. Look！

1382
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:45,690
看见没？我就在这儿，我留下来！
{\fs10}See？ I'm right here！ I'm staying！

1383
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:48,490
接下去怎么走，大家听好了
{\fs10}I'll tell everybody how this is going to go.

1384
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:52,830
你我负责把这门打开，要是谁想走在我前面
{\fs10}You and me are going to open that door. Anybody tries to leave before me,

1385
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:55,340
我就把门放下，然后从头开始
{\fs10}I drop the door, we start this all over again！

1386
01:48:55,370 --> 01:48:59,280
有谁耍花招，就要他好看！
{\fs10}Try any funny business, I guarantee you people are going to get hurt！

1387
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:04,670
我不会的！我向你保证，先放了她吧
{\fs10}I won't！ You have my word. Just let her go.

1388
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:11,350
本，你不走我们也不走
{\fs10}Ben, no, we're not leaving without you.

1389
01:49:13,330 --> 01:49:14,310
阿比盖尔
{\fs10}Abigail.

1390
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:22,160
你带我父母先走，带我父母先走
{\fs10}You make my parents leave. You make my parents leave.

1391
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:32,770
- 不！ - 走！
{\fs10}- No！ - Let's go！

1392
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:37,240
走吧，求求你们了！ 帕特里克，艾米丽，他是在救我们的命
{\fs10}Let's go, please！ Patrick, Emily, he's trying to save our lives.

1393
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:39,610
快，快点
{\fs10}Please, come on.

1394
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:42,780
推啊，本
{\fs10}Push, Ben！

1395
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:48,390
水流太强了！
{\fs10}The current's too strong！

1396
01:49:51,630 --> 01:49:53,830
- 我准备好了！ - 靠你一个了！
{\fs10}- I'm ready！ - It's all yours！

1397
01:50:16,890 --> 01:50:18,050
妈妈！
{\fs10}Mom！

1398
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:20,850
坚持！
{\fs10}Hang on！

1399
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:24,960
屏住呼吸！
{\fs10}Hold your breath！

1400
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:38,370
我们得把本弄出来
{\fs10}We got to get Ben out of there！

1401
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:45,710
如果我卡住门，门就关不上
{\fs10}If I'm stuck in the door, it stays open,

1402
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:48,720
两个房间都会被淹，我们全部淹死
{\fs10}both rooms fill up, and we all drown！

1403
01:50:48,790 --> 01:50:52,920
- 打开门！我来换你！ - 水流太强了！
{\fs10}- Open the door！ I'll get you out！ - The current's too strong！

1404
01:50:53,030 --> 01:50:55,550
如果我打开门，你们全都会被冲走的
{\fs10}I open the door, you'll be washed down！

1405
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:56,960
我会让你出去的！
{\fs10}I'll get you out！

1406
01:50:57,030 --> 01:51:01,400
我发现了黄金之城！是我发现的！
{\fs10}I found the City of Gold！ I found it！

1407
01:51:01,470 --> 01:51:03,460
得让外人知道这一切！
{\fs10}And no one will ever know？

1408
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:07,770
我们可以想办法！大家都能出去的！
{\fs10}We can figure this out！ We can all get out！

1409
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:11,400
这不是一个谜语，本，谜语说完了！
{\fs10}It's not a puzzle！ No more puzzles, Ben！

1410
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:14,640
要么大家一起死，要么只死我一个！
{\fs10}We're all going to die, or it could just be me！

1411
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:18,940
- 告诉大家，是我发现的！ - 别放弃！
{\fs10}- Tell them I found it！ - Don't quit！

1412
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:22,580
米奇！
{\fs10}Mitch！

1413
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:04,190
谢谢！
{\fs10}Thank you.

1414
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:25,670
- 我们还没正式介绍过，我是莱利 - 噢，你好
{\fs10}- We haven't officially met. I'm Riley. - Oh, hi.

1415
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,480
长官！找你的
{\fs10}Sir！ It's for you.

1416
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:36,780
我是萨德斯基
{\fs10}Sadusky.

1417
01:52:37,730 --> 01:52:40,530
- 我找到证据了 - 本！
{\fs10}- I have my proof. - Ben！

1418
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:44,800
我们刚还在谈论你呢，准备自首了吗？
{\fs10}We were just talking about you. Ready to turn yourself in？

1419
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:48,530
还没准备好，我们发现了黄金之城
{\fs10}Not quite. We found the City of Gold.

1420
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:51,410
这跟我无关，你已经犯下了重罪
{\fs10}Doesn't matter. You still committed a federal crime.

1421
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:14,490
停下，别敲了！
{\fs10}Stop. Stop it.

1422
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:17,930
- 总统先生？ - 克雷格，给我一分钟
{\fs10}- Mr. President？ - Craig, give us a minute.

1423
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,770
先生，据您所说，此人绑架过你
{\fs10}Sir, for your information, this is the man who kidnapped you.

1424
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:24,600
可我记得，我们俩只是在密道里探险
{\fs10}As I recall, we were exploring a hidden tunnel,

1425
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:28,240
身后的门突然关死了，是他把我救了出来
{\fs10}and a door closed accidentally, and this man saved my life.

1426
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:29,770
是，先生
{\fs10}Yes, sir.

1427
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:33,750
- 盖茨 - 先生
{\fs10}- Gates. - Sir.

1428
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:39,380
我要把这些话记下来 历经几个世纪的探险后，就在今天
{\fs10}For the record, after centuries of exploration, on this day,

1429
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:42,980
你给你的家族和国家带来了荣耀
{\fs10}you have brought honor to your country and your family.

1430
01:53:44,530 --> 01:53:47,460
你为国家做了杰出的贡献，我感谢你
{\fs10}You've done this country a great service. I thank you.

1431
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,660
- 谢谢 - 克雷格…
{\fs10}- Thank you. - Craig.

1432
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,270
我觉得你可能想看看明天的报纸头版
{\fs10}I thought you might want to take a look at tomorrow's headlines.

1433
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:58,830
明天的？
{\fs10}Tomorrow？

1434
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:02,830
托马斯・盖茨被追认为内战英雄

1435
01:54:07,050 --> 01:54:08,310
谢谢你，先生
{\fs10}Thank you, sir.

1436
01:54:09,290 --> 01:54:11,760
你们所有的人，包括艾米丽和帕特里克・盖茨
{\fs10}All of you, along with Emily and Patrick Gates

1437
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:13,920
由于参与了这项发现，都会受到表彰
{\fs10}will get credit for this discovery.

1438
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:23,430
还有米奇・威尔金森，先生
{\fs10}And Mitch Wilkinson, sir.

1439
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:28,170
- 是吗？ - 是的，先生
{\fs10}- Is that right？ - It's true, sir.

1440
01:54:29,770 --> 01:54:32,770
本，我很好奇我请你帮的那个忙
{\fs10}Ben, I am curious about that favor I asked you.

1441
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:36,750
47页有什么？
{\fs10}Any report regarding what's on page 47？

1442
01:54:36,820 --> 01:54:39,010
我想我帮得上忙
{\fs10}I believe I can help with that, sir.

1443
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:42,280
- 那很好 - 人生无常，总统先生
{\fs10}- So it's good. - Life-altering, sir.

1444
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:49,590
47页上有什么？你们在说那本书？
{\fs10}What's on page 47？ Are you talking about the Book？

1445
01:54:52,830 --> 01:54:53,960
什么书？
{\fs10}What book？

1446
01:54:55,530 --> 01:54:59,590
那东西要小心伺候…你用的是蒸馏水吗？
{\fs10}Be very careful with that. Is that distilled water you're using？

1447
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:01,940
- 是的，女士 - 所有这些东西都登记编目了吗？
{\fs10}- Yes. - Have you catalogued all of this？

1448
01:55:02,010 --> 01:55:03,370
- 没有，女士 - 你没有？
{\fs10}- No, ma'am. - You haven't？

1449
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:06,500
抱歉？你在编这个的目录吗？
{\fs10}Excuse me？ Excuse me, sir？ Are you cataloguing this？

1450
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:09,880
我们买沙发时，你真该在场
{\fs10}You should've been there when we picked out our first couch.

1451
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:15,290
对不起
{\fs10}Excuse me.

1452
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:19,260
你就是那个…那个宝藏猎人，对吗？
{\fs10}Hey, you're that guy… The treasure hunter guy, right？

1453
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:23,160
我不是，事实上你要找的人在那边
{\fs10}No, actually, the guy you're thinking of is somewhere over there.

1454
01:55:23,230 --> 01:55:27,670
不，你就是那作者，莱利・普尔 我是从你的书上认出你的
{\fs10}No. You're him. Riley Poole. I recognize you from your book.

1455
01:55:28,330 --> 01:55:30,320
可以为我签名吗？
{\fs10}Will you sign it？

1456
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:31,390
好啊
{\fs10}OK.

1457
01:55:40,650 --> 01:55:41,630
谢谢
{\fs10}Thank you.

1458
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:46,210
那么，关于茶几…
{\fs10}So, um, the tea tables…

1459
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:50,950
哦，下周我会请人搬到你那里去的
{\fs10}Yes, I'm going to have the movers bring them to you next week.

1460
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,860
我刚想说，你可以留着茶几
{\fs10}I was going to say you can keep them.

1461
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:58,860
而且你还可以…
{\fs10}And maybe you could…

1462
01:55:58,930 --> 01:56:01,230
搬回来跟我住
{\fs10}…come and move back in with me.

1463
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:05,200
- 不，你刚才用了“那么”这个词 - 那么？
{\fs10}- No. You used the word "so. " - So？

1464
01:56:05,270 --> 01:56:07,700
那么，你用“那么”的时候说明你很生气
{\fs10}So, when you say "so," it means you're angry.

1465
01:56:07,770 --> 01:56:11,730
有时候是，但有时候不是
{\fs10}Sometimes. And then sometimes it doesn't.

1466
01:56:11,810 --> 01:56:14,140
有点像个谜语
{\fs10}It's sort of like a puzzle.

1467
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:19,340
你对谜语这么在行，相信你一定解得开
{\fs10}And you're so good at puzzles. I'm sure you'll figure it out.

1468
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:23,080
那么…
{\fs10}So…

1469
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:52,080
莱利・普尔先生敬启

1470
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:59,350
华盛顿  白宫  总统办公室

1471
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:02,800
免税

1472
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:11,500
我爱死这辆车了
{\fs10}I love this car.

1473
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:27,500
== 谢谢观赏 ==

1474
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:38,640
片尾加注：关于谜语“蜂鸟”的推测： 古代美洲文明种族阿兹特克人传说中的主神{\fs12}（战神兼太阳神）{\fs18}名叫胡特兹罗普特利

1475
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:48,640
在当地语言中，这名字由两个词相合而成：“蜂鸟”和“左边” 而阿兹特克人认为向左就是南方，因此左边也可解释为南面

1476
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:58,640
除事态紧急（战神）之外，本的母亲想通过 密码告诉本会合的地点，就在总统山的南坡 片中印证了这一点{\fs12}（总统头像面向东南）

1477
01:57:58,640 --> 01:58:08,640
密文前一句“月侵地处”是为了帮本确认： 神话中战神的母亲是大地女神，因一个羽球 而得孕，战神的姐姐认为此胎不祥，欲杀母

1478
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:18,640
在母亲倒地时，战神出世，为了给母亲报仇 他杀了姐姐及从人，并将姐姐的头抛向天空 变成了月亮，所以他姐姐又称“月亮女神”

1479
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:28,640
月亮神戮杀大地神，战神“蜂鸟南飞”出生 这就是“月侵地处，蜂鸟翼舒”一句的由来 而谜底应该是――危险，向南
