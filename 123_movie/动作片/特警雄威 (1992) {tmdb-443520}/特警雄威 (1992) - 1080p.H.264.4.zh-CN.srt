1
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,285
Pearl Harbor outer marker, 30 minutes.

2
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,834
-Hey, Case! What's happening?
-Tackman, how you doing?

3
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,044
Where's your whites?
The prez is coming.

4
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,713
He won't miss me.

5
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,717
What's this? You're in the Navy,
you've got to look good. There we go.

6
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,219
-Cue Ball!
-Where's your whites?

7
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,932
-Poor boy doesn't have a dress uniform.
-I've got the dress, I forgot the pumps.

8
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,868
Tell him not to worry.
Everything here is handled.

9
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,454
Oh, my God.

10
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:05,666
No, no. No, no, no, that's okay.
We'll take care of it.

11
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,379
Well, it's gonna be a zoo.

12
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,341
-Chief Ryback, captain.
-Yeah, send him in.

13
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,015
Get in your dress uniform.

14
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,310
You know how I feel about ceremonies.
I thought this time--

15
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,771
lf I had your ribbons,
l'd wear them to bed.

16
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,147
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,108
Get in your whites.
I'll introduce you to the president.

18
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,779
-I appreciate that, but--
-That's not a good idea.

19
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,282
For once, Commander Krill and I
are in total agreement.

20
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:43,162
I have 50 gallons of bouillabaisse
I need to prepare by tomorrow.

21
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,499
-My birthday?
-I could do the cheeseburger routine.

22
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,629
It's not for me, it's the crew.
They really love that stuff. So we'll do that.

23
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,465
Just don't show your face
until after the ceremony.

24
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,966
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,927
You're a sorry-looking sailor.

26
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,888
That I am, sir. Thank you, sir.

27
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,354
Sir...

28
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,232
...why do you tolerate that clown?

29
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,150
I know he's a good cook--

30
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:17,947
He's more than a good cook.
You have no idea. Now let him be, XO.

31
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,740
Yes, sir.

32
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,581
Fifty years ago today...

33
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,043
...the infamous Japanese attack
destroyed the Pacific fleet...

34
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,628
... here in Pearl Harbor.

35
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,799
Today, in honor of those who lost
their liVes, the USS Missouri returns.

36
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,511
Built to avenge Pearl Harbor,
she did.

37
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,222
Days after we dropped the bomb
on Hiroshima...

38
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,183
...the Japanese surrendered
cn the Missouri's deck...

39
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,768
...ending World War II.

40
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,648
The Missouri fired the first shots
of the Gulf War.

41
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,569
Her powerful 16-inch guns destroyed
lraqi bunkers.

42
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,364
Her Tomahawk missiles rocketed deep
into the heart of Baghdad.

43
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,535
The fastest and most powerful
dreadnought ever to sail the seas....

44
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,289
Where's your tattoo?

45
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,624
Where I got it, you don't want to see.

46
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:15,129
The last battleship left in the world,
BB 63, will be decommissioned.

47
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,299
President Bush is paying final tribute
to the ship...

48
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,967
...and her great history.

49
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:24,138
Did you hear the joke when Andre
and Beaudreau went hunting on the bayou?

50
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,559
"Where're the guns, Druillet?"

51
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,352
That's about right.

52
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,606
ln the end this unity of purpose....

53
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,485
These ceremonies not only remember war,
they celebrate peace.

54
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,530
The president ordered the removal
of all Tomahawk cruise missiles...

55
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,240
...from U. S. surface ships.

56
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,453
Tomorrow the ship embarks for
San Francisco for her final voyage.

57
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:52,625
Her weaponry will be removed,
dismantled, and never fired again.

58
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:57,129
The Missouri will then take her place
in naval history.

59
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,759
We will gain the inevitable triumph,
so help us God.

60
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,848
Look at the money spent
on this photo opportunity.

61
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,852
Ready to get under way, sir.

62
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,231
Very well, let's single up.

63
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,859
Aye, sir.
Single up all lines.

64
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,560
-Captain, you have clear water to port.
-Very well.

65
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,478
No, no, no.

66
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,273
Krill ain't running this ship.

67
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,484
The old man has to okay
all helicopter landings.

68
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:05,239
How's the captain going to authorize
a surprise party for himself?

69
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,616
We already stowed all the gear.

70
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,911
-What's on this helicopter?
-This little sweetheart.

71
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,125
-Damn. She's in the--?
-Yeah, she's in the cake.

72
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:20,045
That is Miss July '89. Jordan Tate.

73
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:24,258
-We'll be ready for her.
-Good. Go ahead and keep that.

74
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,847
Lieutenant, we don't have time
to talk about this now.

75
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,101
No time for the security
of nuclear weapons?

76
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,395
Maybe I'm not being clear.

77
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,190
Any watches not crucial shall be
secured during the party...

78
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,359
... including the Marine roving patrol.

79
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,904
We're operating on a skeleton crew.

80
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,322
This is a direct order.

81
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,826
The log will show I consider this unsafe,
and obeyed under protest.

82
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,161
Fine.

83
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,665
-You missed a spot.
-Aye, sir.

84
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,292
Hey, Cue Ball.

85
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,878
-Cue Ball in the house.
-What's up?

86
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,379
Show me a move!

87
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,673
Turn up the tunes! Turn up the tunes!

88
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,845
Show them some moves, Cue Ball.
Show them the moves.

89
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,266
Go, Cue Ball! Go, Cue Ball, go!

90
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,203
That was cute.

91
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,538
Petty Officer Ryback?

92
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,291
-Ensign Taylor.
-Sir.

93
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,795
You don't have to "sir" me.
We're casual in the galley.

94
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,714
I'd watch it.
We still have a week together.

95
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,592
I guess I won't get to see you
go through puberty.

96
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,846
What do you want?

97
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,266
I have orders from the XO
on the captain's birthday.

98
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,103
We're having dinner flown in
from Hawaii.

99
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,689
This galley will be cleared by 1700.

100
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,402
You and your crew are to assemble
at the mess deck prior to the helo's arrival.

101
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,695
Negative.

102
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:08,988
Excuse me?

103
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,158
Only I cook for the captain.
You don't like that, talk to him.

104
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,452
I don't believe you get it.

105
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:19,331
See, this is a surprise party.

106
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,335
No one is going to talk
to the captain about this.

107
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,628
You know something?

108
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,257
He don't like surprises. Neither do I.

109
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,094
Then I guess we'll just see
what we'll see. Won't we?

110
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,228
There go that little redhead, boss.

111
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,398
"I guess we'll just see
what we'll see. Won't we?"

112
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,985
Hey, Ryback, man.
Krill's going to skin you alive.

113
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,572
Why is it that I'm
starting to shake so bad...

114
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,782
... and there's this deep fear in me...

115
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:58,787
...thinking about Mr. Krill and
the horrible things he'll do to me?

116
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,085
Commander Krill.

117
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,004
Send him in.

118
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,223
You wanted to see me, captain?

119
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,225
Commander Krill...

120
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,188
... how'd you expect to land
a helicopter without my authorization?

121
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,567
-It was a mistake to think--
-It was a mistake to try.

122
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,403
Your actions are grossly insubordinate.

123
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,281
I want an explanation. Now.

124
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:39,119
Admiral Bates wanted to thank you
for how smoothly things went.

125
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,830
He has a surprise for your birthday.

126
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,916
He's flying in from Hawaii.

127
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:49,588
Bates, I see. lf the admiral wants a party,
I guess we'll have one.

128
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,884
Let's keep it simple.
Off-duty personnel can attend...

129
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,594
... but watches are by the book.

130
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,346
Yes, sir.

131
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,056
Captain...

132
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,809
... since he wants this to be a surprise...

133
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,311
... if you could stay here
till we come for you....

134
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,690
-I'll be engrossed in a novel.
-Very good, sir.

135
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:29,002
-How's that bouillabaisse? Heads up!
-We'll carry it in. This needs some more.

136
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,343
Excuse me.

137
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,641
lf I'm not mistaken...

138
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,854
...every one of you has orders
to report to the mess deck...

139
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,814
...for the party.

140
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,650
You stand fast.

141
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,072
Everyone else go! Now.

142
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,366
See you at the party, Casey.

143
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,912
You know...

144
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,873
...this does look delicious.

145
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,837
It smells like a lard omelet.

146
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,339
I put up with your shit...

147
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,050
... because the captain likes
your cooking.

148
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,220
But this time he won't be here
to save you.

149
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,431
ls that right?

150
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,395
Little flavor.

151
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,442
You like that?

152
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,612
-Fucking crazy?
-That's striking an officer!

153
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,322
That's not striking an officer!

154
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,741
That's striking an officer!

155
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:51,376
-Okay! All right!
-Cuff him and throw him in the brig!

156
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:55,172
-Throw him in the brig!
-You need the old man's signature.

157
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,548
Good point.

158
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,967
Secure him in the meat locker.

159
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,637
Now! Right now.

160
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,930
Let's go.

161
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,601
Now I know why you're a cook.
You hit like a faggot.

162
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,895
Steel.

163
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:14,900
Private Nash...

164
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,694
-...you came on board in Hawaii?
-Yes, sir.

165
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,863
Then you don't know about Ryback.

166
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,327
He is an extreme psychopath.

167
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,747
He hates officers. He hates America.

168
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,834
This is the captain's birthday.
I don't want him ruining it.

169
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,837
No one speaks to him or lets him out.

170
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,383
lf he tries to escape,
shoot him right here.

171
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,094
I'm counting on you.

172
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,096
Yes, sir.

173
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,473
Let's go.

174
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,029
Another cold day in hell.

175
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,871
It speaks well for the Navy
that we can entertain a ship at sea.

176
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,707
lt's so human.

177
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,251
And I love that. Don't you?

178
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,878
I just hope I don't throw up.

179
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,089
You'll be fine.

180
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,733
I love it. I love it!

181
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,042
Goddamn!

182
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,545
Watch your step there.

183
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,757
-Welcome to the USS Missouri.
-Thanks.

184
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,847
You okay?

185
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,685
Fantastic!

186
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,399
We're quite excited.
We're looking forward to a great time.

187
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,863
God, I love this business!

188
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,783
My future wife.

189
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,202
She's landed.

190
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,288
The Bunny's landed. See you.

191
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,791
Private!

192
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,836
Doesn't it seem strange
that Krill put me in here?

193
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,380
I ain't listening to you.

194
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,048
-Welcome aboard.
-Okay.

195
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,592
-Guys, make a hole.
-Okay.

196
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,221
Don't let them bother you.
Been at sea too long. You okay?

197
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,723
I still feel really queasy.

198
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,477
We'll go to the wardroom,
where you can change.

199
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,022
Let the lady through!

200
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:09,157
Be careful with the cake.
Make sure the wires are covered.

201
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,159
That's the way it goes.

202
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,287
-Are you lost?
-No, no. Where do you want us?

203
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,248
-ls the band set up?
-Ready to go.

204
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,250
You're over here.

205
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,419
Starboard side, right now.

206
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,883
You'll knock the captain
off his feet. You're beautiful.

207
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,345
-For motion sickness. Take two.
-This will save me.

208
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,722
-What happened to your face?
-Cut myself shaving.

209
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,349
The cake's almost ready.

210
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,062
We have a room for you to change.
You'll be safe from my men.

211
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,356
-I'm gonna put on my party dress.
-All right.

212
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,400
See you later.
Let's go, get in line!

213
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,152
Hey.

214
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,864
Don't worry. You can play
this with your eyes shut.

215
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,331
Private!

216
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,208
Let me out!

217
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:04,796
You follow Krill's orders, you'll
go to the brig! Use your head!

218
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,508
Go get my pies out of the oven!

219
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,060
I must be nuts.

220
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,652
Very sick. Very sick.

221
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,576
We want to give you
a great big welcome...

222
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,206
...to the big, big,
beautiful Missouri lounge...

223
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:45,045
...out here in the middle
of the big beautiful Pacific Ocean.

224
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,423
I'm Bad Billy.

225
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,886
And these are
the fabulous Bail Jumpers!

226
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,308
I have orders not to talk to you.
Understand? Orders.

227
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,560
You could be held accountable...

228
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,188
... keeping me in here like this.

229
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,732
You have to think about that.

230
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,942
Private?

231
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,320
He didn't say
you can't talk to the captain.

232
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,073
Go ask him if he wants me in here.

233
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,619
You little E- 1 prick.

234
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,710
Lieutenant, this is absolutely beautiful.

235
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,646
Old man says keep her level.

236
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,232
How about an hors d'oeuvre?

237
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,321
What have we here?

238
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,368
All right. There's the Twinkies.
Where's Miss July?

239
00:17:58,661 --> 00:17:59,953
And there she is.

240
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,622
Miss July 1989.

241
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,417
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. No, no!

242
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,544
That's not Miss July.

243
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,379
My God, look at him.

244
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,632
Commander Krill.

245
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,725
Welcome to the revolution.

246
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,357
This party will make history.
No wonder he wanted everyone here.

247
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,657
Maybe Krill isn't
such an asshole after all.

248
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:43,204
That's great. Go get the old man.
He's been waiting on you now.

249
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,041
All right.

250
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,293
Miss July!

251
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,215
Let's go see the old man.

252
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,177
We're going to surprise the captain now.

253
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,222
-Have a good party!
-Come on, dear.

254
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,395
Hey, where's the chief?

255
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,482
ln the meat locker until after the party.

256
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,443
lt's only like 40 degrees in there.

257
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,945
He'll be fine. He's got a guard.

258
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,947
Yeah?

259
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,910
Krill's a maniac.
Tell the captain he spit in my soup.

260
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,995
You got a fire in here.

261
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,873
Get my pies out of the oven!

262
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,216
Jeez.

263
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,331
Feels good walking around
in these pantyhose.

264
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,503
lt's okay. I'm here to escort
the captain to the party.

265
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,839
Aye, commander.

266
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,843
-Commander Krill.
-Send him in.

267
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,182
Krill?

268
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,852
I'm your date tonight, captain.

269
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,576
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

270
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,456
Who is the highest-ranking
officer here?

271
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,333
Who is the highest-ranking officer
in this room?

272
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,003
All right, sir. Stand up.

273
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,380
Stand up and be recognized.

274
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,302
Part the waves there.
Get out of the man's way.

275
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,304
Put a light on the man.

276
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:09,184
Now, you, sir, are the
highest-ranking officer in this room?

277
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,312
Yes. Operations officer.
Third in command.

278
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,690
lt's a pleasure to meet you,
Commander Green.

279
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,237
Get down!

280
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,367
What's going on?

281
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,161
The party's just beginning.

282
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,372
Captain!

283
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,917
Good shot.

284
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,877
Get down! Hands up!

285
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,170
Heads down!

286
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,340
What are you looking at?
On the floor!

287
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,800
Put your head down.

288
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,968
-You gonna be good now, boy?
-Yes, sir.

289
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,054
What is this, a joke?

290
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,639
No joke!

291
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,601
I hear gunfire. What's going on?

292
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,900
lt's done.

293
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,741
Four minutes ahead of schedule.
Damn, I'm good.

294
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,868
Come on!

295
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,204
Come on! Move it!

296
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,289
Let's go.

297
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,751
Mother Goose,
the quails are in the nest.

298
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,590
lt's just the music.

299
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,761
You got shit for brains.
That's gunfire. Call the bridge.

300
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,390
I don't know who you're talking to.
No one's listening to you.

301
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,142
I ain't asking you to listen to me.

302
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,520
Call the captain. Listen to him.

303
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,938
Oh, Ryback.

304
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,197
Seal it!

305
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,162
Let's move it! Move your feet! Let's go!

306
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,999
-Let's go! Move! Move!
-Move your feet!

307
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,136
Eyes on the man in front of you!

308
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,556
Goddamn it,
that's the last time I'll tell you!

309
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,518
Shit!

310
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,235
Let this be a learning experience.

311
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:27,447
If you resist, we will kill you
and the man next to you.

312
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,867
Now move out of here
in an orderly fashion.

313
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,621
Now!

314
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,650
What the hell?

315
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,907
Turn around. Hands on your head.

316
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,557
Where is it? Where is it?

317
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,769
Here it is. Here it is.

318
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,814
Listen to the shit
I've had to put up with.

319
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:49,529
"Commander Krill has become
increasingly hostile to the crew...

320
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,074
... possibly due to anger over
reviews of his performance.

321
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:58,413
I recommend psychological
evaluation before his next assignment."

322
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,670
Do I look like I need a
psychologicaI evaluation?

323
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,297
Not at all.

324
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,427
I got to change.

325
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,312
Behind your head.

326
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,399
On your toes!

327
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,067
Up against the wall.

328
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,865
XO on the bridge.

329
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,284
Listen up.

330
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,454
Hands on your head and move
to the counter, right now.

331
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:46,544
Your destination is the fo'c's'le.
Cooperate and you won't be harmed.

332
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,925
Change of watch.

333
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,806
You've done a good job,
but you're relieved of duty.

334
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,770
Get your hand off that console.

335
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,572
You're a cheeky bastard. Move out!

336
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,953
My God! Bunch of wussies.

337
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,379
The disk, Mr. Pitt.

338
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,800
Guard it with your life.

339
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,593
Of course.

340
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,805
Bring up the layout, if you will.

341
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,394
-We've overridden their systems.
-We control crypto, CIC...

342
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:49,357
...engine rooms, boiler rooms,
bridge and all open decks.

343
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,151
We've welded shut the hatches.

344
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,238
A few loose sailors may be berthing...

345
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,491
...or they're caught in nonessential
areas and can go nowhere.

346
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,245
-The rest are in the fo'c's'le.
-Excellent. Excellent.

347
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,540
Reactivate the weapons systems,
Mr. Pitt.

348
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,791
Mr. Daumer...

349
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:11,921
...you may deploy the welding crews
and chop up broadway.

350
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,884
Commander Krill,
you're hereby promoted to captain.

351
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,638
Congratulations. The ship is yours.

352
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,557
The ship is mine.

353
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,310
Thank you, Billy. All right!

354
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,897
-Can we get something to eat in here?!
-Yes, sir.

355
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,483
Get some food!

356
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,490
Krill warned me you were tricky.

357
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,704
I'm not tricky, I'm just freezing.
Something's going on here.

358
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,165
Call the bridge. No one will yell at you.

359
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,792
You're just doing your job.
Check right away.

360
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,587
All right. All right, I'll check in.

361
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,255
That's all.

362
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,174
Do that. And be careful.

363
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,013
'Tis a rare thing.

364
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,725
This is good. It'll work.

365
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,729
Got a call from Private Nash
on guard duty in the kitchen.

366
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,732
-Pitt, pull it up.
-Shit, shit, shit.

367
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,943
That's an unsecured area.
They can access the whole ship.

368
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,987
Ryback.

369
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,989
Ryback?

370
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,242
Ryback. A cook.
A pain-in-the-ass cook.

371
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,827
Give me that.

372
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,039
-Private Nash.
-Yes, sir.

373
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm glad you checked in.
I've been with the captain.

374
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,378
Keep Ryback under control
and don't open the door.

375
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,006
-Tell him you're sending relief.
-What?

376
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:41,802
Tell him you are sending
somebody to relieve him.

377
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,516
Stand your station fast.
I'm sending someone to relieve you.

378
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:51,812
Is everything all right?
We heard what sounded like gunshots.

379
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,149
Gunshots? Oh, that.

380
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,652
Those are party poppers. Firecrackers.

381
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,362
Part of the party.

382
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,073
Stand firm until you're relieved.

383
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,825
-Yes, sir.
-OVer and out.

384
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,790
Anything else you didn't tell us?

385
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,335
Any further memory lapses
or oversights, perhaps?

386
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,755
No other memory lapses
or oversights, perhaps.

387
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,967
There's two men. One's locked up.
I'll take care of it.

388
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,969
No, no, no.

389
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:27,431
We'll handle it. Secure the galley.
Send Cates and Ziggs.

390
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,100
This Marine's armed.

391
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,727
We should send more. I'll go.

392
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,355
Don't worry. They're professionals.

393
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,108
They can handle 20 Marines...

394
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,485
... and 1 00 cooks.

395
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,827
You're wrong, Ryback. You're wrong.

396
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,414
-They were party poppers.
-You got shit for brains.

397
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:56,252
I know they brainwashed you,
but you have to question authority.

398
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,212
Trust me, boy.

399
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,507
That's gunfire.
Get me out of here and I'll take care of it.

400
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:06,470
I'll be relieved in a few minutes,
so just shut up and sit tight.

401
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:10,016
Something's going on.
Use your head this time.

402
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,101
Do what you got to do. Get me out.

403
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:15,021
Or when I'm out,
I'll shoot you myself.

404
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,777
Commander Krill?

405
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,781
ls that you?

406
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:33,122
Get your hands on your head.
Turn around.

407
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,207
Get down on your knees.

408
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,917
Cross your ankles.

409
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,383
Where's the cook?

410
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,093
ln the reefer.

411
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,012
Which one?

412
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,795
Son of a bitch!

413
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,909
Cates. Hey, Cates.

414
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,310
-Hey, Pitt.
-Yeah.

415
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,187
We've got an F- 1 8.

416
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,443
Daumer, they're sending an F- 1 8
to look for the chopper.

417
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,990
Heading 31 5 miles, speed 430,
approximately 8000.

418
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,121
Two-zero-seven, 6 1 miles now.

419
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,666
Bearing 1 80.

420
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,502
Heading 330.

421
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,355
Four-thirty. Five thousand now,
into descent.

422
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,358
We're going down now.

423
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,690
Looks like one helo on deck.

424
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,113
Going in for a closer look.

425
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,871
Thirty-one to Missouri, over.

426
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,582
Goodbye!

427
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,753
Are you tracking me?

428
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,004
Negative.

429
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,883
He's locked me up! Mayday.

430
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,813
Welcome to the revolution.

431
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,988
-Better call the office.
-Good idea.

432
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,471
You're in deep kimchi, buddy.

433
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,307
Better have it all
in one sock for this one.

434
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,852
Claims he was a company man
who worked for you.

435
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,396
What's his name?

436
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,272
William Strannix.

437
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,067
Jesus Christ!

438
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,988
Not good.

439
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,083
Mr. Breaker...

440
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,795
...you better be candid
with us here tonight.

441
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,506
We need answers,
and we need them now.

442
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:04,555
Gentlemen, if any ships or aircraft
approach within 1 00 miles...

443
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,934
...We will kill the crew and retaliate
with everything in the ship's arsenal.

444
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,980
Bill, this is Tom. What's going on?

445
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,189
Hi, Tom.

446
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,817
I have 32 tomahawks under my thumb...

447
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,653
... and all you can do
is alert the media.

448
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,864
You don't have the launch codes.

449
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,282
Let me guess.

450
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,038
" 5-6-6-0-4-9-9-7-8-0?"

451
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,376
This is insane.

452
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,128
Be careful with that word, Tom.

453
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:39,214
Mr. Strannix,
this is Admiral Bates speaking.

454
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,092
Would you please tell us
why the hell you're doing this.

455
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,302
Hi, admiral.

456
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:47,723
Six months ago, Tom Breaker
canceled Operation Cleopatra.

457
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:53,061
Shortly thereafter, two young men
from Langley tried to cancel me.

458
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,900
You received each man's right forefinger
in the mail, didn't you, Tom?

459
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,028
Tom?

460
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,279
Yes, I did.

461
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,740
Did you expect us
to wait for you to try again?

462
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,408
Look, Bill...

463
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,494
... I know things are a little...

464
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,498
-...chaotic for you right now.
-Chaotic!

465
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,416
Wake up, Tom!

466
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:20,088
You and I know that chaos and
bedlam are consuming the entire world.

467
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,717
UV rays are only the beginning.
We have an inch of topsoil left.

468
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,677
Topsoil?

469
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:30,724
Sexually transmitted diseases,
depletion of the gene pool.

470
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,392
It adds up to oblivion.

471
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,437
Governments will fall.
Anarchies will reign.

472
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,940
-lt's a brave new world.
-Bill?

473
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,692
What are you planning to do?

474
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:45,781
Do you realize that whatever I do
is inevitable? Can we agree on that?

475
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,033
Not necessarily.

476
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,535
There you go.

477
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:54,331
You can't argue with me
or negotiate or attempt a ploy.

478
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,251
You have to reconsider your philosophy.

479
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:01,547
All right, I'm sorry.
Whatever you decide to do is inevitable.

480
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,798
Look at my life.

481
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:07,302
The life you tried to take.
There was Annapolis, Vietnam, so on.

482
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,806
I missed the '60s,
and I believe if I had been there...

483
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,184
...to contribute,
everything would've worked out fine.

484
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:18,480
Bill, if this is about reliving
the '60s, you can forget it.

485
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,274
The movement is dead.

486
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,984
Hence the name.

487
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,820
"Movement." It moves a certain distance,
then it stops.

488
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:29,324
Revolution gets its name by always
coming back around in your face.

489
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,661
You tried to kill me,
you son of a bitch.

490
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,289
So welcome to the revolution.

491
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,292
There's more to follow. I'll stay in touch.

492
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,797
He's flipped.

493
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,633
He's completely flipped.

494
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,928
I want an inventory of everything
on that ship.

495
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,680
Aye-aye, sir.

496
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:57,144
General, here's what we know.

497
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:02,274
The threat is verifiable. It is real.
I repeat, it is real.

498
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,278
Shit! You son of a bitch.

499
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,779
Think they believe you?

500
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,283
They believe I'm crazy,
paranoid or something.

501
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,243
I have a harpoon locked on.

502
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,536
Fire when ready.

503
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,797
Pipe down, men! Pipe down.

504
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:36,350
Missile away.

505
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,018
Oh, boy.

506
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,313
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

507
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,449
Bang! You're dead.

508
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,997
-He's taken out satellite relay.
-What doesn't he want us to see?

509
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,540
He wants to blind us.

510
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,169
lt's illogical. We can
follow his movement from Pearl.

511
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,837
You can vector an AWACS.

512
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,508
-Or send E-2C from Nimitz.
-Make it happen.

513
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,469
Wake up the president.

514
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,516
Bring it in.

515
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,894
Keep it coming in.

516
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,524
Cut it fast.
Time is money on this deal.

517
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:31,571
-This better be a competent crew.
-Get your ass up there!

518
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,074
Watch your heads.

519
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,624
Glad I sent you the blueprints.

520
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,879
I have four sections this way,
seven sections this way.

521
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,924
I'll have it cut and up in an hour.

522
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,765
Time is money on this job!

523
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,021
Time is money.

524
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:08,775
This will cut them to the bone.
Right to the bone.

525
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,947
What's that noise?

526
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,991
That's my beloved crew.

527
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:24,541
Keep trying. Keep pounding.
Someone will hear us.

528
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:38,907
Shut the music off.

529
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,628
What the hell is going on?

530
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,215
What happened to them?

531
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:04,432
-Who are you and what are you doing here?
-My name is Jordan Tate.

532
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,351
I'm Miss July '89.

533
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,313
I was hired to jump out of the cake...

534
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,900
... but I got airsick
on the way here and so...

535
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,611
...this guy gave me these pills.

536
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:20,115
-l guess I fell asleep.
-What kind of bullshit is this?

537
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,993
I am an actress, okay?

538
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,954
I did a Hunter episode
and a Wet'n Wild video.

539
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:29,583
My agent said I was
going to jump out of the cake.

540
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,168
How many on the chopper?

541
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,211
I don't know.

542
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,756
It was full.
There was a band and caterers.

543
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:37,966
Where's the crew?

544
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,595
I don't know. I didn't see anything.

545
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,348
You didn't see or hear anything
and don't remember anything?

546
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,393
I've done stupid things in my life...

547
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,313
... but believe me,
I don't know anything.

548
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,275
All right, I believe you.

549
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:02,699
So who are you? Are you
a special forces guy or something?

550
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,618
I'm just a cook.

551
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,953
A cook?

552
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,539
Just a lowly, lowly cook.

553
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,542
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.

554
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,588
The ship contains 40,000 rounds
of 20 mm CWIZ.

555
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,049
Over 1000 16-inch projectiles.

556
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:24,054
We believe there's 15 harpoon
cruise missiles still aboard...

557
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,680
... and 32 Tomahawks.

558
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,974
What kind of Tomahawks?

559
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,976
lt's all right. lt's okay.

560
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,103
Eight of them are specials.

561
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:35,565
Nuclear-tipped. 220 kilotons each.

562
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,861
Mr. Breaker, would you explain how
this nut could hold a top position...

563
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,821
... in an intelligence agency?

564
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,865
Would you answer that?

565
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:49,037
High-level covert operatives
like Strannix are under great stress.

566
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:52,874
They're creative thinkers who,
by their very nature--

567
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,086
Tom trains everyone
in the ClA who's crazy.

568
00:45:56,545 --> 00:46:01,341
All we want to know
is how he got our battleship.

569
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,177
That's his specialty.

570
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,558
North Korea was refitting a sub
to fire antiship missiles...

571
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,143
... so we sent Strannix in.

572
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,897
You've been financing
this maniac's private army?

573
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,525
It didn't occur to you
it might become a problem?

574
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:22,195
Once we realized we had
lost positive control...

575
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:27,450
... under Executive Order 1 36,
we tried to neutralize him. We missed.

576
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,327
Excuse me.

577
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,913
This North Korean sub....

578
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,624
How do you know he sunk it?

579
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,004
Oh, we're positive he sunk it.

580
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,422
Positive.

581
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,559
Roadrunner to Tweety Bird.
Do you read me? Come in.

582
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,103
Tweety Bird to Roadrunner.
We're nearby.

583
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,939
-How's it going?
-Sub's up.

584
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,109
-lt's all rock 'n' roll to me.
-Any sign of Wile E. Coyote?

585
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:04,446
No. Meet at the birdcage.
Roadrunner out.

586
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,573
-You're the Roadrunner?
-Yeah.

587
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,199
Never been caught.

588
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,747
-Problem. Cates and Ziggs are missing.
-Missing?

589
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,541
I've been radioing them for five minutes.
No response.

590
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,960
-The last location?
-The galley.

591
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:22,339
I told you to send more men.
I told you.

592
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,924
Please don't leave me here alone.

593
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:29,637
Believe me, this is the safest place
you can be. Understand?

594
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,431
No!

595
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,141
Let me out of here!

596
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,190
Let me out!

597
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,818
Do you understand what'll happen
if anybody hears you?

598
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,695
They'll try to kill us.

599
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,615
Now be quiet.

600
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,414
I hate being alone.

601
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,999
Do you hate being dead?

602
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,505
Check it out.

603
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,509
-Clear!
-Clear!

604
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,188
Put those on.

605
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:33,618
Okay, you're coming with me,
you got to be invisible.

606
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,080
lf you walk by a hatch and see the enemy,
you become the hatch.

607
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:41,501
I'm giving you this rifle
with a selector switch on it.

608
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:45,088
One is fully automatic,
one is semiautomatic.

609
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,883
The definition of semiautomatic is,
when you depress the trigger...

610
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,802
...one round will go off.

611
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:56,558
That's what I want to give you.
Spend one round at a time. Okay?

612
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,435
Turn on the lights.

613
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,521
Check the breaker box.
lt's happened before.

614
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,152
Man who did this is a professional.

615
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:13,533
-Who is he and why is he on my ship?
-Your ship?

616
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,953
You wouldn't be on this battleship
if not for me.

617
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,372
He's a cook, plain and simple.

618
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:22,625
-This is not the work of a cook.
-He came with the captain.

619
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:26,838
I know his routine front and back.
He's good with cooking knives.

620
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:28,923
Shit! Cooking knives!

621
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:32,969
He got lucky.

622
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,931
In my professional opinion,
he is a military reject...

623
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:39,350
... in command of a galley.

624
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:41,978
Get down!

625
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,244
-What was that?
-A bomb, jackass.

626
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,955
He used the microwave as a detonator.

627
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,833
Secure everything
between here and the ClC.

628
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:07,212
You see anything, radio at once
for backup. Understand?

629
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,339
Put these fires out!

630
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:16,221
I'd like to see the personnel file
on this plain-and-simple cook.

631
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:19,390
-Yes, sir.
-Put out these goddamn fires!

632
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:26,189
SEAL Team 5 will launch from Nimitz
aboard a CH-53 Echo...

633
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:28,608
...with an Apache gunship in support.

634
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,529
At the objective area, the Apache
will take out the ship's radar...

635
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,031
... and her electronic warfare systems.

636
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,992
Then SEAL Team 5 will board
and retake the vessel.

637
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,662
And the odds of success?

638
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,748
lf it's a lunatic who only
partly controls the ship...

639
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,333
...the odds are good.

640
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,920
But if he's ready for us...

641
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,506
... if he's prepared to repel boarders...

642
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,716
...the odds are not good.

643
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:58,680
Bear in mind, the operators
from SEAL Team 5 are the best there are.

644
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:03,017
This is our only hope of saving
the crew and retaking the ship intact.

645
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:06,688
Let me make one thing
absolutely clear:

646
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,691
lf the SEAL team fails...

647
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:13,987
...we will have no alternative
but to launch an air strike...

648
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,115
... and destroy the Missouri.

649
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,868
You know what that means.

650
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,621
We'll get her back for you.

651
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,457
Make it happen. Make it happen.

652
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:30,378
Twenty-two, 1 2, perfect.

653
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:33,881
lt's 44 feet from the weather deck
to the missile canisters.

654
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:37,760
It'll take a half hour to assemble
that section of the crane.

655
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:43,850
Ryback's file wasn't in personnel.
It was in the captain's private cabinet.

656
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,060
Ryback is an ex-SEAL.

657
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,021
The goddamn cook's a SEAL?

658
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:51,274
Shut up and listen.
"Expert in martial arts...

659
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,735
...explosives, weapons, tactics.

660
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:57,322
Silver Star. Navy Cross.
Purple Heart with cluster.

661
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:02,744
Security revoked after Panama."
So he could only rate as a yeoman...

662
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,247
...or a cook. How little did I know.

663
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,958
We lost two men in the engine room.

664
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:12,086
You were told to review
every crew member's file.

665
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:15,632
I know, but I didn't have access
to the captain's files!

666
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,968
-I'll get this fucker myself.
-Oh, no, calm down.

667
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,304
-Want to get killed?
-Are you an idiot?

668
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,598
-You're calling me an idiot?
-Yeah, I am.

669
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:27,518
Calm down. Get me three roving patrols.
Keep him below the weather deck.

670
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,354
-Move out!
-Stay on schedule!

671
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,857
To the bridge!

672
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,237
I'm the girl.
Why do I have to carry everything?

673
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:42,492
-I support women's lib, don't you?
-When it works in my favor.

674
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,078
-Hear this, all personnel.
-Move ahead.

675
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,372
Beware of booby traps.

676
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:51,084
Do not pursue hostile parties into
areas of the ship we do not control.

677
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:56,297
Report to Daumer individually
at fiVe-minute interVals and sWitch...

678
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,591
...to the alternate frequency.

679
00:52:58,842 --> 00:52:59,967
Now.

680
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,515
Goddamn SEAL.

681
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,393
I'll carry everything...

682
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,479
... if you kill whoever we run into.

683
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,482
I have a rule about killing people.

684
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,486
Actually, I have two rules. One:

685
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,698
I don't date musicians.
And two: I don't kill people.

686
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,575
I'm thrilled to death to hear that.

687
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:27,745
But it leaves a lot of open territory.
Get up the ladder.

688
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,288
-Let's go.
-God!

689
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,085
I think you've got the wrong partner.

690
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,298
Now wait here.

691
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,346
Sit down there.

692
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,558
I'll be back in a minute.

693
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,688
What's that?

694
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,651
What is that?

695
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,278
This is a SEAL magnaphone.

696
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:28,574
lt's an MX 20-20.
lt's a secure satellite uplink.

697
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,993
Like a car phone.

698
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,622
Yeah. Something like that.

699
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,714
Excuse me, this is hot.

700
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,554
You know Casey Ryback?

701
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,472
Chief Ryback?

702
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,642
He's top hand in the Teams.
Wish we had him here.

703
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,979
He reached us on a SEAL magnaphone.
He's on the Missouri.

704
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,522
What?

705
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,025
Listen. Everyone listen up.

706
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,028
Affirmative. Roger that.

707
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,781
Can you estimate
the size of the force?

708
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,158
-l'd say about 30.
-AffirmatiVe.

709
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,244
We'll connect you to Captain Garza.

710
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,912
Stand by.

711
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,706
What if he's working for them?

712
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,293
Hey, I'll guarantee Ryback.
He's a good guy.

713
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,878
Wait a minute.

714
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:25,089
We won't take the chance.
Don't tell him about our response.

715
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:29,427
-Chief Ryback, Captain Garza.
-Glad you're there.

716
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:33,222
What we want you to do
is just feed us on-site intel.

717
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,350
This man may be crazy,
but he's a professional.

718
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:40,646
They're manufacturing a railing
system to offload the Tomahawks.

719
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,441
Believe it or not,
the XO's With them.

720
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,486
Commander Krill's involved?

721
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:48,821
Admiral...

722
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,741
...that means they control the ship.

723
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,409
Holy God.

724
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,496
Chief Ryback,
this is Admiral Bates speaking.

725
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,748
Sir.

726
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:03,377
Coordinate your efforts with us.
I want you to keep cool...

727
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,547
...and wait for the strike team.
Do you understand?

728
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,175
l'd better get
off before they pick up the signal.

729
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,928
-Call us in half an hour.
-Roger that.

730
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,763
You're not a cook.

731
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,016
Yeah, well...

732
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,228
... I also cook.

733
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,939
Get your stuff.

734
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,484
He had an extremely distinguished
career until Panama...

735
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:29,695
...when most of his team was killed
due to poor intelligence.

736
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,115
Ryback's a warrior. The best there is.

737
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:36,786
When he got back from Panama,
he punched his officer in charge.

738
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:40,539
Adams took him on as a cook
so he could finish his 20.

739
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,625
Hold it. Just hold it.

740
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:46,754
What if this toad, Zwieback,
or whatever his name is, is right...

741
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:51,008
... and the missiles are offloaded
before the SEAL team gets there?

742
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,178
There is no way for Mr. Strannix
to get past us.

743
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,265
We have AWAC surveillance
and SOSUS in Honolulu...

744
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,352
...tracking every ship and sub at sea.

745
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:04,438
They leave the Missouri, they're ours.

746
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:08,609
How do we know that Honolulu
isn't his next target?

747
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,695
Tell me that.

748
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,002
Take a look at this.

749
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,631
-Know what all those lights are for?
-I've been trained.

750
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,259
Come on! All right. All right.

751
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,847
-You can fly that helicopter?
-Yeah.

752
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,975
-Then we can get out of here, right?
-No.

753
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,352
Here's the MP5K.

754
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,731
When the dot's on target,
what you see is what you get.

755
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,609
-I told you I don't like guns.
-I know. Neither do l.

756
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:53,487
Now get back under there.

757
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:26,353
These things are going to sell
like hot cakes!

758
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:28,189
Absolutely.

759
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,859
What are you gonna do
with $200 million in the bank?

760
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,360
Buy the presidency.

761
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:03,766
Someone's moving. Right there!

762
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,731
He's on the flight deck! Go! Go!

763
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,652
Come on out of there!

764
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:16,005
Where are you taking me?
I don't know anything! I don't know!

765
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,968
Let go of me! Leave me alone!

766
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:22,845
Get your hands off of me!

767
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,264
Now! God, leave me alone!

768
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:35,858
Move!

769
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,277
There he is!

770
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,120
Move!

771
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,458
Stand fast!
Do not pursue that man!

772
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:03,302
-Secure missile battery three, now!
-Man that hatch!

773
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,095
This guy's a pain in the ass!

774
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,264
We got to do something about him.

775
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,058
I know what to do.

776
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,144
I do.

777
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:17,650
This insanity is so logical.

778
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:22,279
There's a sprinkler system
where they're being held.

779
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,114
Mr. Pitt?

780
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,201
The fo'c's'le.

781
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,829
Hit a button, it starts to flood.

782
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,874
In a short time, they'll all drown.

783
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,293
Ryback'll kill himself trying to save them.

784
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,212
Mr. Pitt.

785
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:47,930
You're a maniac.

786
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,932
Drowning your own crew.

787
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,810
They never liked me anyway.

788
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,105
Bet they fucking love you now.

789
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:05,572
You see this? These are cut everywhere.

790
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:07,116
What is that?

791
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:11,537
They're for a railing system to offload
the missiles onto a ship or sub...

792
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,664
...they're gonna rendezvous with.

793
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,209
What's that?

794
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,337
Morse code.

795
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:23,507
What are they saying?

796
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,178
"Get me the fuck out of here."

797
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,855
-What's that?
-Get away from the hatch!

798
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:59,418
Now what?

799
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,298
Ryback?

800
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:11,013
Johnson, guard the door.
Shoot anyone who comes through.

801
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:12,765
You okay?

802
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,975
Yeah. Are you okay?

803
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,852
Yeah.

804
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:18,937
-Is this all of you?
-What you see.

805
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,398
Six of us got trapped.
What's going on?

806
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,068
We got a problem. Who's this?

807
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:27,613
Calaway, Gunner's mate,
2nd class, '44, '46.

808
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:31,408
This is Jordan. She's a casualty
of the situation I'll brief you on.

809
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:34,953
-Hi.
-Nice to see you. You too, Case.

810
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,581
Granger, you take this.

811
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:41,877
-Get your tools. We've got work to do.
-Right.

812
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,505
We're jumping into a shit storm here.

813
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,599
Must've been a power surge.

814
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,351
Yeah.

815
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:03,690
That's the last one.

816
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:07,194
This should disable their
weapons systems within a half an hour.

817
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:10,906
Mr. Ryback,
may I have your attention, please?

818
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,659
This is Captain Krill speaking.

819
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,833
l'd like you to look at the monitors...

820
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,335
...where you are
at this point in time.

821
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,713
Are you watching?

822
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,216
I prepared a special show for you.

823
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:33,470
Here it goes.

824
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,644
I want you to know
there are no hard feelings.

825
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,773
I have no grudge against you...

826
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,109
...or the rest of the crew.

827
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,652
You did your best.

828
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,287
Discipline is right out
the window here.

829
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,333
Granger, turn it off.

830
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,461
We got to save them.

831
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,045
They'll have a trap.

832
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,841
But they're expecting me,
not all of us.

833
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:12,759
All of what? I do laundry.

834
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:16,221
I ironed during the Gulf War.
I ain't cut out for this.

835
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:18,307
You're in the Navy, remember?

836
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,642
"lt's not a job, it's an adventure."

837
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:23,479
To hell with that.
I'm on the college program.

838
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,355
-I'm with you, Case.
-Let's do it.

839
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,024
We're out of here.

840
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,610
All right,
I'll stay and watch Miss July.

841
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,988
-Get the lights out in broadway.
-I'm going.

842
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,824
Okay, but the emergency lights
will kick on soon.

843
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:39,369
All right, what the hell.
How does this work?

844
01:06:58,348 --> 01:06:59,389
Go!

845
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:09,441
Take cover! Take cover! Come on, guys!

846
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:19,868
Take cover! Get down!

847
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,040
Turn it!

848
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,835
Turn the water off!

849
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,048
They're gonna get us out of here!

850
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:34,508
They're gonna get us out!

851
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,556
Pull him out of there!
Pull him out of there!

852
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,474
Help him, Tack! Help him!

853
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,939
Come on, buddy!

854
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:50,899
Breathe!

855
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,068
Listen to him!

856
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,820
Hang in there!

857
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:56,947
Shit!

858
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:58,699
We'll be offloading in an hour.

859
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:01,994
Listen, he freed a few men,
and I think...

860
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:06,415
...they went into the fo'c's'le,
but we got them pinned down.

861
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,792
Kill them if you can't contain them.

862
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,502
It worked. They're trapped.

863
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,296
-Good.
-Drop the anchor!

864
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,811
This is where it's going to happen.

865
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,944
Hello?

866
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,822
-Who in the hell is this?
-Who in the hell is this?

867
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:43,243
This is Admiral Bates.
I'm trying to get ahold of Ryback.

868
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:46,246
He's in a gunfight.
I'll have to take a message.

869
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,206
What's going on there?

870
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,543
Hold on. Here.

871
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,172
Yes, sir.

872
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:58,467
Chief Ryback, this is Admiral Bates.

873
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:02,220
I see that you completely
disobeyed my orders. Correct?

874
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:05,307
Sorry. You can court-martial me
if I live.

875
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,933
I see.

876
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,186
Listen to me carefully.

877
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,022
SEAL Team 5 is en route.
You understand?

878
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:13,440
Yes, sir.

879
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:17,319
Nimitz air group is our backup.
Understand?

880
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,364
Yes, sir.

881
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:23,867
Now, since your ass is on the line,
I authorize you...

882
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:28,038
...to do whatever you can
to aid the arrival of the SEALs.

883
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,957
Because if I goddamn
can't control you...

884
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:35,462
-... I might as well support you. Correct?
-That's affirmative, sir.

885
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,297
You....

886
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,842
You have some good luck there, sailor.
I'm out.

887
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:44,262
They got a lot of trouble on that ship.

888
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,061
Here I go.

889
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,370
I'm not staying here.

890
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,831
-Where are you going?
-What did you say to her?

891
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:24,928
-What are you doing?
-The safest place is behind you.

892
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,181
Hug the wall.
Get out of the middle!

893
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,892
Miss July, come back here!

894
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,056
Casey!

895
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:11,034
TAG leader, this is Cobra escort.
We have you in our sights.

896
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:13,787
You should see us
on your portside now.

897
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,631
Francois, put the money in the Zurich
bank now, or nothing will happen.

898
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,675
Fuck you, Strannix!

899
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:30,053
Sell what we got
in MacGregor Aircraft.

900
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,848
It'll go to shit
when they find out about this.

901
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,393
Two choppers trying to sneak in
under our radar.

902
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:37,644
Strike team.

903
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:41,314
We drive a hard bargain for hard value.

904
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:49,990
You give me any more trouble,
I'll call Mohammed. Understand?

905
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,242
Strike team is in range and locked on.

906
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:53,577
Kill them.

907
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:56,997
Not you, Francois.
I'll put my accountant on the line...

908
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:59,624
...with my account number.
Talk to that frog.

909
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,254
Strannix?

910
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:06,047
Something's wrong.

911
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:10,218
We've got a big problem here.
Switch to auxiliary!

912
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:11,553
Nothing.

913
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:18,602
Shit, I lost the phalanx.
We're sitting ducks.

914
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:20,812
Get me secure to the sub.

915
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:28,153
Sub's up.

916
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:30,864
Coyote, this is Roadrunner. Come in.

917
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:56,431
Here come the good guys.

918
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,482
One minute!

919
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:10,236
The fantail's fouled up!
We're going in on the bow.

920
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,537
What the hell was that?!

921
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,853
lt's confirmed. We lost them all.

922
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,649
We have no choice now...

923
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,571
... but full air assauIt from the Nimitz.

924
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:58,785
Mr. Trenton, would you please?

925
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:04,165
We need more hands on deck
to help tie this sub up.

926
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:05,709
Start offloading.

927
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:10,296
The crane isn't finished.
We got another problem below decks.

928
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,800
Pull four men off the welding crew
to help tie up the sub.

929
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:15,093
-Go.
-Yes, sir.

930
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,860
My goodness!

931
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:39,367
Daumer, Daumer, Daumer.
Why didn't you hire this person?

932
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:43,538
Whatever his price would've been,
it would've been worth it.

933
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,627
Bring it up!

934
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:34,089
Okay, okay. Ease it over.
Ease it over now.

935
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:59,739
Number seven. Number seven.
Get number seven now.

936
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,324
Easy!

937
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,020
There's someone in the water!

938
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:14,856
Behind you!

939
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,108
-I saw someone in the water!
-Hey! Hey!

940
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,161
Hook him!

941
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,081
Hook that son of a bitch!

942
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:49,265
Check for a bomb!

943
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:07,617
Who saw him? Come on!

944
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,557
You're incredible, Ryback.

945
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:36,187
lt's a shame you're not cooking for us.

946
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:52,495
Next thing I know...

947
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:55,915
...you'll be dating musicians.

948
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:03,840
What the hell you doing over there?

949
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:11,889
Where's Daumer?

950
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:13,808
Probably dead.

951
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,436
The bowplane is jammed.

952
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:17,895
We can't submerge.

953
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:23,860
I'll handle it.
It'll be operational under way.

954
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:26,446
You fix it, I'll make you an admiral.

955
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:28,740
Consider it done. Where are you going?

956
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:32,910
-Make Honolulu glow in the dark.
-Outstanding.

957
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:36,164
I'll meet you 15 miles
due south in the captain's launch.

958
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:39,375
Rally your men here in zero one.

959
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:44,547
I need an acetylene torch,
an arc welder and a crowbar, now!

960
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,509
-What'd he say?
-He can't fix it.

961
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,262
I'll fix it! Go! Now!

962
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:54,307
Why can't you speak English?

963
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,481
Hang in there, Casey.

964
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:23,711
Talk to me.

965
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,631
There's nothing to say.

966
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,509
Whatever they did...

967
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:32,136
...they're smarter than I am.

968
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,472
Everything's dead.

969
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,182
lt's hopeless.

970
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:39,060
Nothing is hopeless. Take heart.

971
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,566
Give me time, I'll figure it out.

972
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:48,820
I like your attitude. Excellent.

973
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:55,868
lt's clear. Hey, Case.

974
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:01,541
What the hell?

975
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:08,423
I'll put it to you in plain English.
It is so simple.

976
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:11,008
Hammer that rod into place.

977
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:14,178
Weld it over the bowplane.
Without it, we can't survive.

978
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,514
Make him understand. Now!

979
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:28,818
Where's Johnson?

980
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:32,697
-He's gone.
-We can't let them get away with this!

981
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:34,740
What about those 5-inch guns?

982
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:39,537
No good. We offloaded all the
armor-piercing rounds. We got starbursts.

983
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,497
Nothing that will penetrate.

984
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,086
Calaway.

985
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,047
-Gunner's mate.
-Yeah, chief.

986
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,257
See those?

987
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:55,386
We still got shells for those.

988
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,276
I did it.

989
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:14,197
lt's charging. ln a few minutes
we'll have enough power to fire.

990
01:23:14,448 --> 01:23:15,573
Well done.

991
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:24,499
Let's go!

992
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:30,755
Get on those last three bags!

993
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:34,467
Out of line.

994
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:37,887
-Another one.
-Watch my hand signals!

995
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:39,972
Stand clear!

996
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,146
Easy, guys, easy. Just glide it through.

997
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:59,534
What's the sub's course and speed?

998
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:02,328
Course 1 72. Speed six knots.

999
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:05,665
Get down the 5-inch guns!

1000
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,252
-What do you want me to do?
-See those black switches?

1001
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:13,506
-Click them on, one by one.
-lf the sub blows, won't the nukes go?

1002
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,633
No. They won't detonate.

1003
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,134
They'll sink with the sub.

1004
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:18,427
Lower the cradle.

1005
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,513
Cradle lowered.

1006
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:23,140
-Ram the projectile.
-Easy.

1007
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,394
Ram the powder easy.

1008
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:27,687
Real easy.

1009
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,106
Starbursts are ready.

1010
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,649
Fire the starburst!

1011
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:34,902
All right.

1012
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:38,447
You, secure this room.
Get back to work, jack-off!

1013
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:43,119
They're firing at us!

1014
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:45,037
They're just desperate.

1015
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:49,750
Those are starbursts.
They don't have shells to hurt us.

1016
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:51,836
Two-zero-four degrees, Calaway.

1017
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,426
Elevate the barrel.

1018
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:00,761
Zero-two-eight degrees.

1019
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,147
Fire in the hole.

1020
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:24,577
He's doing it! We're out of time!

1021
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,954
They're reloading right now.

1022
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:28,497
Granger, Tackman! Reload!

1023
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:33,836
Lowering cradle.

1024
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:35,379
Scoot over!

1025
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,092
Goddamn it!

1026
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:41,344
Close the breech.

1027
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:45,473
Lower it. Lower the bowplane!

1028
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:51,103
Pull! lt's working! lt's working!
Come on, let's go.

1029
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:52,938
Two-four-one degrees.

1030
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:54,523
Two-four-one degrees back.

1031
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:56,525
Dive!

1032
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:02,573
lt's working!

1033
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,868
-Two-zero-four degrees.
-Two-zero-four degrees.

1034
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:07,495
This is it.

1035
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,750
Ryback is gone.

1036
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:15,586
Let me look.

1037
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:20,174
Fire in the hole!

1038
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:38,734
-Direct hit!
-We hit it!

1039
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,742
Strannix, what the hell is going on?

1040
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:58,087
Daffy Duck. Porky Pig. Little red fucker
with the mustache. The big chicken.

1041
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:01,257
Strannix!

1042
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,344
All of my life...

1043
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:08,097
... Saturday morning cartoons.

1044
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:09,682
The best.

1045
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:12,351
Shit.

1046
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:16,814
For example...

1047
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:21,402
... remember those two little shrimp
coming in, riding seahorses...

1048
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:23,654
... little chaps, little pistols?

1049
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:26,031
Shooting back over their shoulders.

1050
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,701
Rescue that lobster from the...

1051
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,203
... Swedish cook.

1052
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:33,581
Funniest thing I ever saw!

1053
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,708
-Splendid work, by the way.
-Strannix!

1054
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,626
Splendid work!

1055
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,253
My, my, my...

1056
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:42,339
... how hell doth quicken the spirit.

1057
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:45,843
-Tomahawks!
-They're up and ready.

1058
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:47,094
Where?

1059
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:50,055
-Fire control.
-Of course! The fire control.

1060
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:52,975
Chips and dips on the weather deck.

1061
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,395
Don't be late! Motor launch is waiting!
All hands!

1062
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:02,318
Clear out of here!

1063
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,112
Let's go.

1064
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:07,198
Strannix!

1065
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:08,407
Four minutes.

1066
01:28:08,909 --> 01:28:11,827
-Four minutes.
-Meet us at the motor launch.

1067
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:13,704
Four little minutes.

1068
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:17,333
Home run.

1069
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:19,627
Yeah!

1070
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:21,921
We did it!

1071
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:24,256
This little piggy went to market.

1072
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:27,843
This little piggy stayed home.

1073
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:30,137
And this little piggy....

1074
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,932
Oh, mama. Oh, mama.

1075
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:38,604
All the way home!

1076
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:04,129
Happy trails.

1077
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:09,301
ln the captain's launch, there's the
MX 20-20, the SEAL magnaphone.

1078
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:11,887
-Bring it here. Take her with you.
-The what?

1079
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:13,639
The car phone.

1080
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:25,359
-Admiral?
-Yes, sir.

1081
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:29,029
The Nimitz is tracking two Tomahawks
launched from the ship.

1082
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:30,865
-Where are they headed?
-Honolulu.

1083
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:32,491
Oh, God.

1084
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:35,870
-What's the flight time?
-Twenty-four minutes, sir.

1085
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:41,000
-Can we destroy them in the air?
-Destruct codes are on the Missouri.

1086
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:43,878
Scramble Navy and Air Force
fighters from Pearl.

1087
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:48,424
What are the consequences
of missiles dropping on Honolulu?

1088
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:53,304
About 1 million people will reach
1 0, 000 degrees Fahrenheit...

1089
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:55,264
... in less than a second.

1090
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:01,353
Mr. Secretary....

1091
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,982
We'll just blame it on the cook.

1092
01:30:05,775 --> 01:30:07,151
Absolutely.

1093
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,782
Take it north.

1094
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:16,493
Roger that. Heading north.

1095
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:46,542
I'll take that weapon.

1096
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:48,711
Quietly.

1097
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:50,629
Now.

1098
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:02,141
You look familiar.

1099
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,143
I know you, don't I?

1100
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:06,061
I think you do.

1101
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:09,982
Been a long time.

1102
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:11,900
Yes, sir. It has.

1103
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:13,235
Turn around.

1104
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:16,488
We'll have a tour. Step forward.

1105
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:21,785
Here we have...

1106
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:23,537
...our Tomahawks...

1107
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,416
... speeding their way to the sunny
Aloha State. Turn around.

1108
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:29,543
As you can see...

1109
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:32,296
...there will be no return.

1110
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:34,256
And I got the key.

1111
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:36,967
The lock is broken. Step forward.

1112
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,761
Sit over there.

1113
01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:42,598
You'll watch the end of the world on TV.

1114
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:46,685
Put your feet up. Relax.

1115
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:51,356
You know, you're good.

1116
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:53,942
You are really good.

1117
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,278
lt's gonna be a shame to kill you.

1118
01:32:57,614 --> 01:32:59,698
Behold my finest work.

1119
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:01,992
Do me a favor. Tell me something.

1120
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:06,246
You really think blowing up
a bunch of innocent people...

1121
01:33:06,706 --> 01:33:08,290
... is gonna change anything?

1122
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:10,125
What made you flip like this?

1123
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:13,545
I got tired of coming up with
desperate solutions...

1124
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:17,007
...to impossible problems
created by other fucking people.

1125
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:21,220
All your ridiculous,
pitiful antics won't change a thing.

1126
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:22,930
You and l...

1127
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:26,517
...we're puppets in the same sick play.

1128
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:28,644
We serve the same master...

1129
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:34,441
... and he's an ungrateful lunatic.
There's nothing we can do about it.

1130
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:36,235
You and I are the same.

1131
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,321
No. There's a difference, my man.

1132
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:42,783
You have faith. I don't.

1133
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:40,299
Keep the faith, Strannix.

1134
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:51,727
Locked on my nose, 1 5 miles.

1135
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:58,817
Five miles, on target.
Weapon status, clear.

1136
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:00,611
Roger.

1137
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:08,785
-Excuse me, admiral.
-Yes?

1138
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:11,914
They intercepted one missile.

1139
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,707
And the other one?

1140
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:15,417
It slipped through.

1141
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:34,394
Chief...

1142
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:38,857
...we've only got time for one shot.
So we'll do it by the numbers.

1143
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:41,568
Ryback, load the disk.

1144
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:43,487
Now punch 47.

1145
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:45,447
You're now on KU.

1146
01:35:48,618 --> 01:35:51,078
Code is six, four...

1147
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:53,247
...three, five...

1148
01:35:53,623 --> 01:35:55,415
...zero, zero.

1149
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:59,086
That's 643500.
ls my read-back correct?

1150
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:00,420
That's affirmatiVe.

1151
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:12,474
Stand by, sir.

1152
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:37,249
Got it!
Nimitz is no longer tracking.

1153
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:40,502
Good man! Good man, Ryback!

1154
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:48,427
Sir, call off your bombers.
Call off your bombers.

1155
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:52,264
We're calling off the aircraft.
We're calling them off.

1156
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,309
Thanks, Ryback. Great job!
Great job!

1157
01:36:55,601 --> 01:37:00,105
Want to go swimming?
I got a Zodiac and some C-rays...

1158
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:02,482
... a little umbrella....

1159
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:04,026
I'll go with you.

1160
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,865
She's all right! She's all right!

1161
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:13,910
Good, good, all of you guys.

1162
01:37:14,162 --> 01:37:15,203
Great!

1163
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,122
Good job!

1164
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:24,588
Hold on in there,
we'll get you out in a minute!

1165
01:37:42,065 --> 01:37:43,899
What did I miss, chief?

1166
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:56,828
You'll need three or four stitches.
I wanna see you down in the infirmary.

1167
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:59,122
I'm afraid of needles, you know.

1168
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:05,253
-What's for breakfast, Case?
-Subs, Tackman. Subs!

1169
01:38:06,255 --> 01:38:08,090
Case, show me a move.

1170
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:09,883
Here's one move.

1171
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:43,333
Present arms!
