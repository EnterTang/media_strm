1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000


2
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,630
这个世界改变了
The world is changed.

3
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,840
我从水中触摸到
I feel it in the water.

4
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,520
我从地上感觉到
I feel it in the earth.

5
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,080
我从空气中嗅到
I smell it in the air.

6
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,390
过去的一切
Much that once was...

7
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,150
都已失落
...is lost.

8
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,690
现在已经没人记得了
For none now live who remember it.

9
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:04,900
魔  戒

10
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,180
这一切都从铸造魔戒开始
It began with the forging of the Great Rings.

11
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,280
精灵族得到三只戒指
Three were given to the Elves.

12
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,250
他们长生不老 也是最有智慧最公平的种族
Immortal,wisest and fairest of all beings.

13
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,380
矮人族分到七只戒指
Seven to the Dwarf-lords.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,560
他们很会挖掘矿坑 是山洞的能工巧匠
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

15
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,260
而九只
And nine...

16
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,460
九只戒指送给了人类
...nine rings were gifted to the race of Men...

17
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,530
他们比别人更渴望权力
... who,above all else,desire power.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,600
(中土世界)

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,870
每只戒指都拥有统治每个种族的力量
For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.

20
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,540
但他们都受到了欺骗
But they were all of them deceived.

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,870
因为还有另一只被铸造了
For another ring was made.

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,280
在魔多末日火山的烈焰中
In the land of Mordor,in the fires of Mount Doom...

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,260
黑暗魔君索伦暗中铸造了一只至尊魔戒
... the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring...

24
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,320
来控制一切
... to control all others.

25
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,590
他在至尊魔戒中注入他的邪恶 残酷
And into this Ring he poured his cruelty,his malice...

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,000
以及支配天下的可怕欲望
...and his will to dominate all life.

27
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,870
一只统治一切的至尊魔戒
One Ring to rule them all.

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,370
一个接一个...
One by one...

29
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,240
中土世界的自由之土感受到了至尊魔戒的力量
... the Free Lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the Ring.

30
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,480
但是有些人群起反抗
But there were some who resisted.

31
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,720
人类和精灵组成了最后的同盟对抗魔多的邪恶兵团
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor.

32
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,650
他们在险恶的末日火山为中土世界的自由奋战
And on the slopes of Mount Doom,they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

33
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,130
稳住阵线！
Tangado haid!

34
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,420
放箭！
Leithio i philinn!

35
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,420
胜利终于在望
Victory was near.

36
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,930
但是至尊魔戒的力量
But the power of the Ring...

37
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,170
无人能敌
...could not be undone.

38
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,700
就在这时候
It was in this moment...

39
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,260
当大家都失去希望之际
... when all hope had faded...

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,600
人皇之子埃西铎拾起他父亲的宝剑
... that Isildur,son of the king,took up his father's sword.

41
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:29,200
黑暗魔君索伦 中土世界自由人民之敌终于被击败
Sauron,the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth,was defeated.

42
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,240
至尊魔戒落入埃西铎手中
The Ring passed to Isildur...

43
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,650
他只有一次机会永远摧毁邪恶
... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

44
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,520
但是人心
But the hearts of Men...

45
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,220
很容易受到蛊惑
...are easily corrupted.

46
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,090
而且至尊魔戒有它自己的意志
And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.

47
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,920
它背叛了埃西铎
It betrayed Isildur...

48
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,160
最后害死了他
... to his death.

49
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,200
不该被遗忘的东西
And some things that should not have been forgotten...

50
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,770
也遗忘了
... were lost.

51
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,800
历史成为传说
History became legend...

52
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,000
传说成为神话
...legend became myth.

53
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,110
两千五百年来
And fortwo and a half thousand years...

54
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,980
至尊魔戒的下落无人得知
... the Ring passed out of all knowledge.

55
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,450
直到机会到来
Until,when chance came...

56
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,220
让它蛊惑一个新的持有者
...it ensnared a new bearer.

57
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,400
我的宝贝
My precious.

58
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,190
至尊魔戒落入咕噜手中
The Ring came to the creature Gollum...

59
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,310
他把它带到迷雾山脉的洞穴中
... who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.

60
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,470
他的身心完全被魔戒占据
And there it consumed him.

61
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,700
它落到我手中
It came to me.

62
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,350
我的 我的爱 是我的
My own. My Iove. My own.

63
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,250
我的宝贝
My precious.

64
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,330
魔戒让咕噜得到违反自然的长寿
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

65
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,360
五百年来它扭曲他的心智
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

66
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,160
它在咕噜阴暗的洞穴中静静地等待着
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,it waited.

67
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,640
黑暗再度笼罩大地
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

68
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,710
谣传东方升起邪恶力量
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

69
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,710
人们心中产生无名的恐惧
... whispers of a nameless fear.

70
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,210
于是至尊魔戒知道
And the Ring of Power perceived...

71
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,220
它即将再度现身
...its time had now come.

72
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,280
它舍弃了咕噜
It abandoned Gollum.

73
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,450
但是出乎至尊魔戒的意料之外
But something happened then the Ring did not intend.

74
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,890
它被一个最料想不到的人捡到
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable.

75
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,160
这是什么？
What's this?

76
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,800
一个哈比人
A Hobbit.

77
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,740
夏尔的比尔博・巴金斯
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

78
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,710
一只戒指
A ring.

79
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,780
不见了！
Lost!

80
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,990
我的宝贝不见了！
My precious is Iost!

81
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,480
不久的将来...
For the time will soon come...

82
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,920
哈比人将决定世界的命运
... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

83
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,430

9月的第22天
The 22nd day of September...

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,160
1400年

以夏尔历法计算
...by Shire-reckoning.

(夏尔)

哈比屯西区 巴榭路 袋底洞

91
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,810
夏尔

...Middle-earth.

（去而复返：哈比人的故事 比尔博・巴金斯著）

99
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,380
现在...
Now...

100
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,110
该从何说起呢？
...where to begin?

101
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,450
对了
Ah,yes....

102
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,800
关于...
"Concerning...

103
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,870
（关于哈比人）

104
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,490
哈比人
...Hobbits."

105
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,260
哈比人一直都在夏尔的四个区开垦种植 安居乐业
Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire...

106
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,330
数百年来
...for many hundreds of years...

107
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,480
都乐于遗忘并被世人遗忘
...quite content to ignore and be ignored...

108
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,840
也就是世上的其他人种
...by the world of the Big Folk.

109
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,850
毕竟中土世界充满不计其数的奇怪生物
Middle-earth being,after all,full of strange creatures beyond count...

110
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,220
哈比人的存在微不足道
...Hobbits must seem of little importance...

111
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,420
他们并非骁勇善战的勇士
...being neither renowned as great warriors...

112
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,790
也不算是聪明绝顶的智者
...nor counted among the very wise.

113
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,160
佛罗多！有人敲门
Frodo! Someone at the door.

114
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,940
事实上 有人说
In fact,it has been remarked by some...

115
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,550
哈比人唯一真正热爱的就是食物
... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

116
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,110
但这是很不公平的说法
A rather unfair observation...

117
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,950
因为我们也很喜欢酿麦酒
...as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales...

118
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,120
还有抽烟草
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

119
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,430
但是我们内心的真爱
But where our hearts truly lie...

120
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,720
就是和平宁静
...is in peace and quiet...

121
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,630
还有肥沃的土地
...and good,tilled earth.

122
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,970
每一个哈比人都热爱种植生长的东西
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

123
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,550
别人一定会觉得我们的日子过得太悠闲
And,yes,no doubt to others,our ways seem quaint.

124
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,950
但是今天更是印证了我的想法
But today of all days,it is brought home to me.'

125
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:20,490
能过朴实简单的生活真的是一种幸福
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

126
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,150
（生日快乐比尔博・巴金斯）

127
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,860
佛罗多 开门！
Frodo,the door!

128
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,600
讨厌 那小子呢？
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

129
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,470
佛罗多！
Frodo!

130
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,810
外面风景多美丽
Down from the door where it began

131
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,390
我要踏上这旅程
And I must follow if I can

132
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,490
眼前道路无止尽
The road goes ever on and on

133
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,160
蜿蜒崎岖又漫长
Down from the door where it began

134
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,340
虽然路程尚遥远
Now far ahead the road has gone

135
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,870
我必须继续前进
And I must follow if I can

136
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,770
你迟到了
You're late.

137
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,850
巫师绝对不会迟到 佛罗多・巴金斯
A wizard is never late,Frodo Baggins.

138
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:24,280
他也不会早到 他一定是按照计划准时到
Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.

139
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,690
见到你太好了 甘道夫！
It's wonderful to see you,Gandalf!

140
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,310
我怎么会错过你比尔博叔叔的生日？
You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

141
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,140
那老不死还好吧？
How is the old rascal?

142
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,210
我听说生日宴会非常盛大
I hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence.

143
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,880
你也了解比尔博 他把这儿搞得鸡飞狗跳
You know Bilbo. He's got the whole place in an uproar.

144
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,990
这样他应该高兴了
Well,that should please him.

145
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,020
夏尔有一半人都被邀请了
Half the Shire's been invited.

146
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,890
另外一半也不请自来
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

147
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,400
夏尔的生活就这样继续着
And so life in the Shire goes on...

148
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,600
从古到今都一样
... very much as it has this past Age...

149
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:19,340
自给自足 快乐幸福 没有什么太大的改变
...full of its own comings and goings,with change coming slowly.

150
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,410
或许永远也不会有所改变
If it comes at all.

151
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,120
因为夏尔的一切历久弥新
For things are made to endure in the Shire...

152
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,780
一代一代地传下去
...passing from one generation to the next.

153
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,180
巴金斯家族一直都有成员住在山丘下的
There's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill...

154
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,730
袋底洞
...in Bag End.

155
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,260
以后也一定会有
And there always will be.

156
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,400
不过说实话 最近比尔博有点怪
To tell you the truth,Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

157
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,870
我是说 比以前更怪
I mean,more than usual.

158
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,770
他成天把自己关在书房
He's taken to Iocking himself in his study.

159
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,640
我每次趁他不注意都看到他在研究古地图
He spends hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

160
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,920
它跑哪儿去了？
Where's it gone?

161
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,820
他一定在搞什么名堂
He's up to something.

162
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,860
好吧 你不说拉倒
All right,then. Keep your secrets. 

163
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,460
什么？
What?

164
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,370
我知道你一定脱不了关系
But I know you have something to do with it.

165
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,660
真是的
Good gracious me.

166
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,970
在你出现前 巴金斯家族一向都很规矩
Before you came along,we Bagginses were very well thought of.

167
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,970
确实
Indeed.

168
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,810
我们从不冒险或做意外的事
Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.

169
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,990
如果你指的是关于龙的那件事 我只是勉强牵涉
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon,I was barely involved.

170
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,780
我所做的只是轻轻地把你叔叔推出门外
All I did was give your uncle a Iittle nudge out of the door.

171
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,090
不管怎样你都被正式列为捣乱份子
Whatever you did,you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.

172
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,330
真的吗？
Oh,really?

173
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,970
甘道夫！甘道夫！
Gandalf! Gandalf!

174
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,340
放烟火 甘道夫
Fireworks,Gandalf!

175
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,040
甘道夫！放烟火 甘道夫！
Gandalf! Fireworks,Gandalf!

176
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,930
甘道夫？
Gandalf?

177
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,340
你回来了我好高兴
I'm glad you're back. 

178
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,640
我也是 好孩子
So am I,dear boy.

179
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,880
我也是
So am I.

180
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,580
（与晚会无关者免进）

181
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,150
不要 谢谢！
No,thank you!

182
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,280
我们不欢迎访客 祝寿者或远亲！
We don't want any more visitors,well-wishers or distant relations!

183
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,980
那么一个非常老的朋友呢？
And what about very old friends?

184
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,890
甘道夫？
Gandalf?

185
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,540
比尔博・巴金斯
Bilbo Baggins.

186
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,990
亲爱的甘道夫
My dear Gandalf!

187
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:06,330
见到你真好 111岁大寿！谁会相信？
Good to see you. 111 years old! Who would believe it?

188
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,100
你一点都没老
You haven't aged a day.

189
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,750
快点 进来吧！
Come on,come in!

190
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,320
欢迎 欢迎
Welcome,welcome.

191
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,010
来吧
Oh,here we are.

192
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,160
茶？还是来烈一点的？
Tea? Or maybe something a Iittle stronger?

193
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,130
我还有几瓶1296年的陈年好酒
I've got a few bottles of the OId Winyard Ieft. 1296.

194
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,360
很好的年份 几乎跟我一样老
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

195
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,030
我老爹珍藏的 打开一瓶如何？
It was laid down by my father. What say we open one,eh?

196
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,870
茶就行 谢谢
Just tea,thank you.

197
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,940
你上个礼拜就该到了
I was expecting you sometime last week.

198
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,450
没关系 你一向想来就来 想走就走
Not that it matters. You come and go as you please. AIways have and always will.

199
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,890
只是让我有点措手不及 家里只有冻鸡和腌菜
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

200
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,460
还有乳酪 不行 太寒酸了
There's some cheese here. No,that won't do.

201
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,570
我们有覆盆子果酱 苹果馅饼
We've got raspberry jam,an apple tart....

202
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,260
但是好像还不太够 哦 没事 没问题
But not much for afters. Oh,no,we're all right.

203
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,310
我找到一些海绵蛋糕
I've just found some sponge cake.

204
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,840
(孤山)

205
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,510
我可以煮几个蛋 如果你...
I could make you some eggs if you'd--

206
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,710
甘...
Gan...

207
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,410
茶就行 谢谢
Just tea,thank you. 

208
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,010
好吧
Oh,right.

209
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,020
你不介意我吃吧？
You don't mind if I eat,do you? 

210
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,420
不 尽管吃吧
No,not at all.

211
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,390
比尔博！比尔博・巴金斯！
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

212
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,190
说我不在家！
I'm not at home!

213
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,800
是塞克维尔・巴金斯
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

214
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,190
我知道你在那里！
I know you're in there! 

215
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,460
他们在房子后面
They're after the house.

216
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,230
他们一直不原谅我在这里住这么长时间
They've never forgiven me for Iiving this Iong.

217
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,240
我被这些像苍蝇成天黏着我的亲戚
I've got to get away from these confounded relatives,hanging on the bell all day...

218
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,380
吵得一刻不得安宁
...never giving me a moment's peace.

219
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,110
我好想再看到高山
I want to see mountains again.

220
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,610
高山 甘道夫！
Mountains,Gandalf!

221
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,580
然后找一个安静的地方写完我的书
And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book.

222
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,480
哦 茶
Oh,tea.

223
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,520
所以你想要实现你的计划？
So you mean to go through with your plan? 

224
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,520
对 对 一切都在掌握中
Yes,yes. It's all in hand.

225
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,920
全都安排好了
All the arrangements are made.

226
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,560
谢谢
Oh,thank you.

227
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,400
佛罗多有些怀疑
Frodo suspects something.

228
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,060
当然了 他可是巴金斯家的人
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

229
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,870
不是硬瓶家的笨小孩
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.

230
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,210
你会告诉他吧？
You will tell him,won't you?

231
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,110
会 会
Yes,yes. 

232
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,110
他很喜欢你
He's very fond of you.

233
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,870
我知道
I know.

234
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,590
我开口的话他一定会跟着我去
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

235
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,630
但我想佛罗多还是衷心地深爱着夏尔
I think in his heart,Frodo's still in Iove with the Shire.

236
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,560
绿油油的树林和土地
The woods,the fields.

237
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,060
潺潺的溪流
Little rivers.

238
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,240
我老了 甘道夫
I am old,Gandalf.

239
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,880
虽然我看起来并不老 但是我的心老了
I know I don't Iook it,but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart.

240
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,580
我的意志变得薄弱
I feel thin.

241
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,450
一切都索然无味
Sort of stretched...

242
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,090
就像面包上的黄油涂得不够多
...Iike butter scraped over too much bread.

243
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,970
我需要一个假期
I need a holiday.

244
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,750
一个非常长的假期
A very Iong holiday.

245
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,160
我也不期望我会回来
And I don't expect I shall return.

246
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,600
说实话 我不想回来
In fact,I mean not to.

247
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,340
老托比 南区最好的烟草
OId Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

248
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,290
甘道夫 我的老朋友
Gandalf,my old friend...

249
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,300
这将是令人难忘的一晚
...this will be a night to remember.

250
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,180
你好 你好
Hello,hello.

251
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,490
小胖博哲 很高兴见到你 欢迎 欢迎
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you. Welcome,welcome.

252
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,060
山姆 快去邀萝西跳舞
Go on,Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

253
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,430
我想再喝一杯麦酒
I think I'll just have another ale. 

254
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,230
哦 不 你别喝了
Oh,no,you don't.

255
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,070
去啊！
Go on!

256
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,050
我站在那儿
So there I was...

257
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,350
面对三个可怕的巨魔
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

258
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,520
它们吵着
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...

259
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,100
要怎样把我们吃掉
...about how they were going to cook us.

260
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,660
是一口把我们吞了 还是一个接一个把我们压扁成果冻
Whether it be turned on a spit,or to sit on us one by one,squash us into jelly.

261
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,900
他们喋喋不休吵个没完没了
They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors...

262
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,700
结果天亮的第一道曙光
...that the sun's first Iight crept over the top of the trees...

263
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,200
把它们都变成了石头！
...and turned them all to stone!

264
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,890
快点
Quickly.

265
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,080
飞走了！
Up they go!

266
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,160
不 不 那个大的！大的！
No,the big one.

267
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,240
抱腹太太 很高兴见到你 欢迎 欢迎
Mrs. Bracegirdle,how nice to see you. Welcome,welcome.

268
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,310
这都是你的孩子吗？
Are all these children yours?

269
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,470
老天爷 你还真是能生啊
Good gracious,you have been productive.

270
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,820
比尔博？
Bilbo?

271
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,280
塞克维尔・巴金斯！
Sackville-Bagginses!

272
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,550
快躲起来！
Quickly,hide!

273
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,630
谢了 我的侄子
Thank you,my boy.

274
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,470
你是个好孩子 佛罗多
You're a good lad,Frodo.

275
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,580
我一直都很自私 你知道
I'm very selfish,you know.

276
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,470
对 我真的很自私
Yes,I am. Very selfish.

277
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,290
我不知道为什么我在你父母死后收养了你
I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died...

278
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,950
但这并不是出于仁慈
...but it wasn't out of charity.

279
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,690
我想是因为
I think it was because...

280
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,190
在这么多亲戚里头
...of all my numerous relations...

281
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,980
只有你表现出了真正的精神
...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

282
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,290
比尔博 你是不是偷喝了老爹珍藏的酿酒？
Bilbo,have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?

283
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,990
没有
No.

284
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,890
好吧 喝了 但这不是重点
Well,yes,but that's not the point.

285
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,370
重点是 佛罗多...
The point is,Frodo...

286
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,470
你一定会过得很好
...you'll be all right.

287
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,710
好了！
Done! 

288
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,910
你应该把它插到地里面
You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

289
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,970
它是插在地里了
It is in the ground. 

290
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,610
在外面呢！
Outside!

291
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,310
这都是你的主意
This was your idea.

292
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,690
比尔博
Bilbo.

293
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,640
比尔博 当心那只飞龙
Bilbo,watch out for the dragon!

294
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,210
飞龙？这儿有一千年没出现飞龙了
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years.

295
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,590
那个不错
That was good.

296
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,290
我们再来一个
Let's get another one.

297
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,120
梅里雅达克・布兰迪巴克和皮里格林・图克
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

298
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,200
我就知道
I might've known.

299
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,170
致词 比尔博！
Speech,Bilbo!

300
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,370
致词！
Speech!

301
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,570
致词！
Speech!

302
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,080
亲爱的巴金斯家和波芬家
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

303
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,080
图克家和布兰迪巴克家
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

304
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,750
葛卢伯家 丘伯家
...Grubbs,Chubbs...

305
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,980
吹号者家
...Hornblowers...

306
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,820
博哲家
...Bolgers...

307
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,750
抱腹家
...Bracegirdles...

308
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,090
和傲脚家
...and Proudfoots. 

309
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,590
是傲足家！
Proudfeet!

310
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,930
今天是我第111个生日！
Today is my 111th birthday!

311
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,670
生日快乐！
Happy birthday!

312
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,270
生日快乐！
Happy birthday!

313
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,780
但是111年的时间太短了 我真想一直跟你们在一起
But alas,eleventy-one years is far too short a time to Iive among...

314
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,850
这么杰出优秀的哈比人
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

315
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,520
我只认识你们一丁点
I don't know half of you half as well as I should Iike...

316
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,320
而你们一丁点也不值得我喜欢
...and I Iike Iess than half of you half as well as you deserve.

317
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,670
我有事要做
I have things to do.

318
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,170
我把这件事拖得太久
I've put this off far too Iong.

319
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,980
我遗憾地宣布宴会结束了！
I regret to announce this is the end!

320
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,320
我要走了
I'm going now.

321
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,330
我要向大家道别
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

322
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,890
再见
Goodbye.

323
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,290
我想你一定觉得这招很高明
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

324
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,970
好了 甘道夫 你没看到他们的表情吗？
Come on,Gandalf. Did you see their faces?

325
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,070
世上有很多神奇的戒指 但是不该随便乱用
There are many magic rings in this world,and none of them should be used Iightly.

326
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,440
我只是开个玩笑
It was just a bit of fun.

327
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,180
你或许是对的 像平常一样
Oh,you're probably right,as usual.

328
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,710
你会留出一只眼睛照看佛罗多吧？
You will keep an eye on Frodo,won't you? 

329
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,310
两只眼
Two eyes.

330
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,180
只要它们一有空闲
As often as I can spare them.

331
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,490
我要把一切都留给他
I'm Ieaving everything to him. 

332
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,650
你的那只戒指呢？
What about this ring of yours?

333
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,390
那也留下来吗？
Is that staying too? 

334
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,090
当然 当然
Yes,yes.

335
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,600
它在壁炉上面的信封里面
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

336
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,640
不对 等一下 它在...
No. Wait,it's...

337
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,870
在我的口袋里
...here in my pocket.

338
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,720
不是...？不是很奇怪吗？
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd,now?

339
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,880
是啊 有何不可呢？
Yet,after all,why not?

340
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,000
我何不留着它？
Why shouldn't I keep it? 

341
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,300
我认为你应该把戒指留下来
I think you should leave the ring behind.

342
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,930
有那么困难吗？
Is that so hard?

343
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,430
没有啊
Well,no.

344
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,360
当然有
And yes.

345
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,400
它落到我手中 我不想离开它
Now it comes to it,I don't feel Iike parting with it.

346
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,470
它是我的 我找到的！它落到了我手中！
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

347
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,900
那没必要生气吧
There's no need to get angry. 

348
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,780
如果我生气了 全是你的错！
Well,if I'm angry,it's your fault!

349
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,010
它是我的
It's mine.

350
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,780
我一个人的
My own.

351
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,220
我的宝贝
My precious.

352
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,120
宝贝？
Precious?

353
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,160
以前也有别人这么叫过它
It's been called that before,but not by you.

354
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,060
我自己的东西关你什么事？
What business is it of yours what I do with my own things?

355
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,930
我认为你留着那只戒指够久了
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

356
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,370
你只想独吞它！
You want it for yourself! 

357
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,970
比尔博・巴金斯！
Bilbo Baggins!

358
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:52,440
别把我当成一个江湖术士
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

359
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,310
我并不想抢你的东西
I am not trying to rob you.

360
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,010
我只是想帮助你
I'm trying to help you.

361
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,830
这么多年了 我们一直是朋友
All your Iong years,we've been friends.

362
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,960
请你像以前一样相信我
Trust me as you once did.

363
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,070
让它走吧
Let it go.

364
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,660
你说的对 甘道夫
You're right,Gandalf.

365
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,440
戒指一定要留给佛罗多
The ring must go to Frodo.

366
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,720
天色晚了 路还很长
It's late. The road is Iong.

367
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,440
对 是时候了
Yes,it is time.

368
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,220
比尔博 戒指还在你的口袋里
Bilbo,the ring is still in your pocket.

369
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,990
我替我的书想到一个结尾
I've thought up an ending for my book:

370
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,630
他从此快乐地生活下去直到他寿终正寝
"And he Iived happily ever after to the end of his days."

371
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,240
你一定会的 我亲爱的朋友
And I'm sure you will,my dear friend.

372
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,770
再见了 甘道夫
Goodbye,Gandalf.

373
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,120
再见了 亲爱的比尔博
Goodbye,dear Bilbo.

374
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:52,160
眼前道路无止尽
The road goes ever on and on

375
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,130
后会有期了
Until our next meeting.

376
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,130
它是我的 我一个人的
It's mine. My own.

377
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,760
我的宝贝
My precious.

378
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,940
黑暗中的谜语
Riddles in the dark.

379
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,630
比尔博！
Bilbo!

380
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,300
比尔博！
Bilbo!

381
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,880
我的宝贝
My precious.

382
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,710
宝贝
Precious.

383
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,450
他走了 对吧？
He's gone,hasn't he?

384
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,290
他一直都说要离开这儿
He talked for so Iong about Ieaving...

385
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,190
没想到他真的走了
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

386
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,600
甘道夫？
Gandalf?

387
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,510
比尔博的戒指
Bilbo's ring.

388
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,210
他去和精灵住在一起
He's gone to stay with the EIves.

389
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,510
他把袋底洞留给你
He's Ieft you Bag End.

390
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,680
还有他所有的财产
AIong with all his possessions.

391
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,760
戒指现在是你的了
The ring is yours now.

392
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,460
把它放到看不到的地方
Put it somewhere out of sight.

393
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,860
你要去哪儿？
Where are you going?

394
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,330
有些事我一定要去处理
There are some things that I must see to. 

395
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,330
什么事？
What things?

396
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,370
问题 需要解答的问题
Questions. Questions that need answering. 

397
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,070
你才刚到
You've only just arrived.

398
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,270
我不明白
I don't understand.

399
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,640
我也不明白
Neither do I.

400
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,220
保守它的秘密
Keep it secret.

401
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,190
保证它的安全
Keep it safe.

402
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,320
夏尔！
Shire!

403
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,760
巴金斯！
Baggins!

404
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,250
第二纪元的3434年
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.

405
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,820
以下记载的是刚铎之王埃西铎...
Here follows the account of Isildur,High King of Gondor...

406
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,680
以及找到至尊魔戒的过程
...and the finding of the Ring of Power. "

407
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,030
它落到我手上了
"It has come to me.

408
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,700
这只至尊魔戒将是我的镇国之宝
The One Ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

409
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,340
我的后代将永远对它效忠
All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate...

410
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,340
我绝不容许魔戒受到任何损伤
...for I will risk no hurt to the Ring.

411
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,030
这是我的宝贝
It is precious to me...

412
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,540
我经过多少痛苦才得到它
... though I buy it with great pain.

413
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,880
戒指的刻痕逐渐消褪
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

414
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,920
那些赤焰般的文字现在全部消失
The writing,which at first was as clear as red flame,has all but disappeared.

415
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,190
只有火焰能让秘密显现
A secret now that only fire can tell. "

416
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,710
夏尔
Shire.

417
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
巴金斯
Baggins.

418
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:46,410
这周围没有巴金斯家族 他们都住在哈比屯
There's no Bagginses around here. They're all up in Hobbiton.

419
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,620
在那边
That way.

420
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,860
我的身心己疲惫
To heal my heart and drown my woe

421
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,370
阵阵风雨不停歇
Rain may fall and wind may blow

422
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,470
但是我仍有
But there still be

423
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,070
好长的路要走
Many miles to go

424
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,210
雨滴声音多美妙
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

425
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,570
大珠小珠落玉盘
And the stream that falls From hill to plain

426
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,610
不管硬水或清泉
Better than rain or rippling brook

427
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,210
都比不上这儿的啤酒
Is a mug of beer inside this Took

428
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,450
最近有一些陌生人经过夏尔
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

429
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,760
包括矮人族和更可怕的坏人
Dwarves and others of a Iess than savory nature.

430
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,630
一场大战即将来临
War is brewing.

431
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,160
山里头来了一群妖魔鬼怪
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

432
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,990
这些只是谣传或是小孩子的童言童语而己
Far-off tales and children's stories,that's all that is.

433
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,660
你说话像老比尔博・巴金斯 疯疯癫癫的
You're beginning to sound Iike that old Bilbo Baggins. Cracked,he was.

434
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,840
佛罗多先生 他是有点疯癫
Young Mr. Frodo here,he's cracking.

435
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,440
还以它为荣
And proud of it.

436
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,510
干杯 老伯
Cheers,Gaffer. 

437
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,910
干杯
Cheers.

438
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,180
夏尔以外的事跟我们无关
It's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders.

439
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,650
只要你们不去惹麻烦 麻烦就不会找上门
Keep your nose out of trouble,and no trouble'll come to you.

440
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,060
晚安 小伙子们
Good night,lads.

441
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,260
晚安
Good night.

442
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,920
晚安了 可爱的金发姑娘
Good night,sweet maiden of the golden ale.

443
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,470
他最好别打她的主意
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

444
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,160
放心啦 山姆 萝西知道他是个混蛋
Don't worry,Sam. Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

445
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,400
真的吗？
Does she?

446
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,340
晚安 山姆
Good night,Sam. 

447
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,040
晚安 佛罗多先生
Good night,Mister Frodo.

448
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,300
它隐秘吗？它安全吗？
Is it secret? Is it safe?

449
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,310
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

450
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,490
伸出手来 佛罗多
Hold out your hand,Frodo.

451
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,830
很凉
It's quite cool.

452
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,100
你能看到什么？
What can you see?

453
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,280
你看到什么吗？
Can you see anything?

454
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,380
没有
Nothing.

455
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,040
什么也没有
There's nothing.

456
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,610
等等
Wait.

457
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,990
上面有刻痕
There are markings.

458
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,850
好像是精灵文 我看不懂
It's some form of EIvish. I can't read it.

459
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,630
很少人能看得懂
There are few who can.

460
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,040
这是魔多的古文字 我在这里念不出来
The language is that of Mordor,which I will not utter here.

461
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,700
魔多！
Mordor!

462
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,000
用通用语 它说的是
In the common tongue,it says:

463
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,700
至尊戒 驭众戒
"One Ring to rule them all...

464
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,250
至尊戒 寻众戒
...One Ring to find them...

465
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,650
魔戒至尊引众戒
...One Ring to bring them all...

466
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,950
禁锢众戒黑暗中
...and in the darkness bind them."

467
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,620
这就是至尊魔戒
This is the One Ring...

468
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:14,090
黑暗魔君索伦用末日火山的烈焰铸成
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom.

469
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,330
埃西铎从索伦手中夺过来
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.

470
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,660
比尔博找到它
Bilbo found it.

471
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,230
在咕噜的洞穴中
In Gollum's cave. 

472
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,070
是的
Yes.

473
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,800
六十年来 比尔博不动声色地持有至尊魔戒
For 60 years,the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

474
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,410
他因此而延长了寿命 延迟了老化
...prolonging his Iife,delaying old age.

475
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,450
但不再如此了 佛罗多 邪恶在魔多蠢蠢欲动
But no Ionger,Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor.

476
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,090
至尊魔戒被唤醒了
The Ring has awoken.

477
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:43,060
它听到主人的召唤
It's heard its master's call.

478
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,330
但是他已经被消灭了 索伦已经被消灭了
But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed.

479
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,930
不 佛罗多
No,Frodo.

480
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:59,170
索伦的灵魂还存活着
The spirit of Sauron endured.

481
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:04,910
他的生命和至尊魔戒紧紧相系 而至尊魔戒仍然幸存
His Iife force is bound to the Ring,and the Ring survived.

482
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,380
索伦已经回来了
Sauron has returned.

483
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,180
他的半兽人大军与日俱增
His Orcs have multiplied.

484
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,450
他在魔多也重建了要塞巴拉多
His fortress at Barad-dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

485
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:19,390
索伦只要得到至尊魔戒就能让黑暗再度笼罩大地
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness.

486
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,660
他在搜寻它
He is seeking it.

487
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:25,730
全心全意 不择手段地搜寻
Seeking it. All his thought is bent on it.

488
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,670
同时至尊魔戒也渴望
For the Ring yearns above all else...

489
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:32,310
回到它主人的手中
...to return to the hand of its master.

490
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,310
他们本为一体
They are one...

491
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,570
至尊魔戒和黑暗魔君
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

492
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,810
佛罗多
Frodo...

493
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,350
绝对不能让他找到至尊魔戒
...he must never find it.

494
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,480
好
All right.

495
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,150
我们把它放起来 藏着它 我们再也不提它
We put it away. We keep it hidden. We never speak of it again.

496
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,990
没人知道它在这儿 是吧？
No one knows it's here,do they?

497
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,860
是不是？甘道夫
Do they,Gandalf?

498
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,340
有一个人知道比尔博得到至尊魔戒
There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring.

499
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,570
我到处找咕噜
I Iooked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

500
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,900
但是敌人先找到他
But the enemy found him first.

501
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,170
我不知道他被拷打了多久
I don't know how long they tortured him.

502
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,840
但是在可怕的哀嚎和呻吟声中 他们听出两个名字
But amidst the endless screams and inane babble,they discerned two words.'

503
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,180
夏尔！
Shire!

504
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,950
巴金斯！
Baggins!

505
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,820
夏尔
Shire.

506
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,460
巴金斯
Baggins.

507
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,260
他们会找到这里
But that would Iead them here!

508
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,930
什么人？
Who goes there?

509
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,900
你拿去 甘道夫！
Take it,Gandalf!

510
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:33,880
拿去！
Take it! 

511
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,460
不 佛罗多
No,Frodo.

512
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,500
你一定要拿去！
You must take it! 

513
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,900
你不能把魔戒交给我！
You cannot offer me this ring!

514
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,340
我要把它送给你！
I'm giving it to you!

515
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,440
别诱惑我 佛罗多！
Don't tempt me,Frodo!

516
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,210
我不敢拿
I dare not take it.

517
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,980
更不能保证它的安全
Not even to keep it safe.

518
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,110
你要了解 佛罗多
Understand,Frodo...

519
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,420
我只希望利用至尊魔戒行善事
...I would use this Ring from a desire to do good.

520
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:05,560
但是通过我 它将释放无法想像的邪恶力量
But through me,it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.

521
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,970
但是它不能留在夏尔！
But it cannot stay in the Shire! 

522
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,070
没错
No.

523
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,570
的确不能
No,it can't.

524
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,280
我该怎么做？
What must I do?

525
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,880
你一定要离开 尽快离开
You must Ieave. And Ieave quickly. 

526
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,680
哪里？我该去哪里？
Where? Where do I go?

527
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,950
离开夏尔 赶到布理村
Get out of the Shire. Make for the village of Bree.

528
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,320
布理
Bree.

529
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,490
那你呢？
What about you? 

530
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,290
我会等你...
I'll be waiting for you...

531
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,990
在跃马旅店
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

532
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,530
魔戒在那儿安全吗？
And the Ring will be safe there? 

533
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,930
我不知道 佛罗多
I don't know,Frodo.

534
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,090
我没有一点答案
I don't have any answers.

535
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:48,140
我必须去见巫师长 他有智慧和力量 相信我 佛罗多
I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me,Frodo.

536
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,470
他知道该怎么做
He'll know what to do.

537
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,950
你不能用巴金斯这名字
You'll have to Ieave the name of Baggins behind you.

538
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,640
这名字在夏尔之外不安全
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

539
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,620
白天赶路 别走大道
Travel only by day. And stay off the road.

540
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,450
我可以很容易穿过农田
I can cut across country easily enough.

541
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,300
我亲爱的佛罗多
My dear Frodo.

542
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,630
哈比人真不可思议
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

543
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,700
你只要一个月就能了解他们
You can Iearn all that there is to know about their ways in a month.

544
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,310
然而一百年后
And yet,after a hundred years...

545
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,500
他们仍然让你吃惊不已
...they can still surprise you.

546
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,480
趴下去
Get down.

547
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:38,180
可恶的山姆卫斯・詹吉！你一直在偷听吗？
Confound it all,Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping?

548
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,860
我才没有偷听 真的 我只是在窗外割草而已
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest. I was cutting the grass under the window.

549
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,520
你不认为现在剪草有点晚了？
A little late for trimming the verge,don't you think?

550
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,880
我听到说话声
I heard raised voices. 

551
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,540
你听到什么？快说！
What did you hear? Speak!

552
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,830
没...没...没什么重要的
Nothing important.

553
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:54,500
我听到戒指 黑暗魔君和世界末日 但是...
That is,I heard a good deal about a ring,a Dark Lord and the end of the world but--

554
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:59,410
甘道夫先生 别伤害我 别把我变成怪物
PIease,Mr. Gandalf,sir,don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

555
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,740
不要吗？
No?

556
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,080
也许不会
Perhaps not.

557
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,760
我想你有更好的用处
I've thought of a better use for you.

558
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:13,520
快点 山姆卫斯 跟上来
Come along,Samwise. Keep up.

559
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,230
你们两个要小心
Be careful,both of you.

560
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,260
敌人有很多眼线
The enemy has many spies in his service:

561
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,440
包括飞鸟野兽
Birds,beasts.

562
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,040
它安全吗？
Is it safe?

563
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,080
千万别戴上它
Never put it on...

564
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,720
黑暗魔君的爪牙会被它的力量吸引来
...for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power.

565
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,370
你要记着 佛罗多...
AIways remember,Frodo...

566
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:39,050
至尊魔戒想要回到主人手上
...the Ring is trying to get back to its master.

567
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,720
它想要被找到
It wants to be found.

568
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,330
这就是了
This is it.

569
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,800
这是什么？
This is what?

570
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,200
我只要再跨一步
If I take one more step...

571
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,610
就是我离家最远的一次
...it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.

572
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:39,300
走吧 山姆
Come on,Sam.

573
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,620
我记得比尔博总是说
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

574
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,260
旅途很危险 佛罗多
"It's a dangerous business,Frodo." 

575
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,560
一旦出了门 你踏步上了路
"Going out your door,You step onto the road.

576
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,570
如果你不继续前进
and if you don't keep your feet...

577
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,930
谁知道你可能跑到哪去了
... there's no knowing where you might be swept off to. "

578
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:16,230
星辰女王远在那西方之洋
a Galad ren

579
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,380
山姆
Sam.

580
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:22,030
光明普照
i veniar

581
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:22,990
木精灵
Wood-elves.

582
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,330
大地苍苍
hi' aladhremmin

583
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:36,130
吾等徜徉在林海莽莽
ennorath

584
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:40,460
他们要去白塔以外的港口
They're going to the harbor beyond the White Towers,

585
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,740
他们要去灰港岸
To the Grey Havens.

586
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,370
他们要离开中土世界
They're leaving Middle-earth.

587
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,740
永远不再回来
Never to return.

588
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,690
不知道为什么
I don't know why...

589
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,860
我会感到这么悲伤
...it makes me sad.

590
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:02,560
我躺到哪儿都有树根顶着我的背
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back.

591
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,030
闭上眼睛
Just shut your eyes...

592
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,970
想像着你躺在自己的床上
...and imagine you're back in your own bed...

593
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,070
柔软的床垫和舒服的羽毛枕头
...with a soft mattress and a Iovely feather pillow.

594
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,080
这没有用 佛罗多先生
It's not working,Mr. Frodo.

595
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,120
我在荒郊野外永远都睡不着
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

596
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,830
我也睡不着 山姆
Me neither,Sam.

597
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,420
末日火山升起硝烟
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

598
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,250
时间不多了
The hour grows late.

599
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,990
灰袍巫师甘道夫赶到艾辛格
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

600
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,630
寻求我的建议
...seeking my counsel.

601
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,830
你就是为了这件事来找我？
For that is why you have come,is it not?

602
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,300
我的老朋友
My old friend.

603
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,170
萨鲁曼
Saruman.

604
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,670
你确信如此吗？
You are sure of this? 

605
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,970
确信不疑
Beyond any doubt.

606
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,120
那么说至尊魔戒被发现了
So the Ring of Power has been found.

607
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,480
这么多年来 它一直在夏尔
All these Iong years,it was in the Shire.

608
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,490
就在我鼻子底下
Under my very nose. 

609
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,190
而你却没有智慧看出它
Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

610
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:42,400
你喜欢的半身人的烟草很明显地熏坏了你的头脑
Your Iove of the halfling's Ieaf has clearly slowed your mind.

611
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:46,930
但是还有时间 有足够的时间对抗索伦 如果我们行动迅速
But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

612
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,490
时间？
Time?

613
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,100
我们哪来的时间？
What time do you think we have?

614
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:56,380
索伦的力量几乎完全恢复
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

615
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,810
虽然他尚未完全复生
He cannot yet take physical form...

616
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,680
但他的灵魂仍有强大魔力
...but his spirit has Iost none of its potency.

617
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:07,420
虽然他被封在要塞中 但是他却无所不知
Concealed within his fortress,the Lord of Mordor sees all.

618
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:13,930
他的视线能穿透乌云 阴影 土地甚至肉体
His gaze pierces cloud,shadow,earth and flesh.

619
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:18,560
你知道我在说什么 甘道夫
You know of what I speak,Gandalf.

620
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,740
一个被烈焰包围的巨大眼晴
A Great Eye,Iidless,wreathed in flame.

621
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,510
索伦之眼
The Eye of Sauron.

622
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,270
他正在聚集邪恶力量
He is gathering all evil to him.

623
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:35,580
很快 他就能召集大军向中土世界展开攻击
Very soon,he'll have summoned an army great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

624
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,290
你知道这些？
You know this?

625
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,350
怎么会？
How?

626
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,590
我已经看到了
I have seen it.

627
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:46,220
真知晶球是个危险的东西 萨鲁曼
A palantir is a dangerous tool,Saruman.

628
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,420
为什么？
Why?

629
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,600
为什么我们要害怕使用它？
Why should we fear to use it?

630
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,230
其它的真知之石下落不明
They are not all accounted for,the lost Seeing-stones.

631
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,610
我们不知道有谁也在看
We do not know who else may be watching.

632
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,940
时间比你想的还迟
The hour is later than you think.

633
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,450
索伦已经在行动
Sauron's forces are already moving.

634
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,650
那九个已经离开米那斯魔窟
The Nine have Ieft Minas Morgul.

635
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,880
那九个？
The Nine?

636
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,120
他们在仲夏夜跨越艾辛河
They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

637
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,960
伪装成黑骑士
...disguised as riders in black.

638
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,430
他们已经到了夏尔？
They've reached the Shire? 

639
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,130
他们会找到至尊魔戒
They will find the Ring.

640
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,970
然后杀死它的持有者
And kill the one who carries it.

641
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:31,960
佛罗多！
Frodo!

642
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,990
你不会真的以为哈比人能对抗索伦吧？
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron?

643
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,520
谁都无法对抗他
There are none who can.

644
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,800
反抗魔多的力量...
Against the power of Mordor...

645
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,600
是毫无胜算的
...there can be no victory.

646
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:05,740
我们必须投靠他 甘道夫
We must join with him,Gandalf.

647
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:09,340
我们必须投靠索伦
We must join with Sauron.

648
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,680
这么做才聪明 我的朋友
It would be wise,my friend.

649
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,640
告诉我...
Tell me...

650
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,840
朋友...
...friend...

651
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,380
智者萨鲁曼几时发疯了？
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

652
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,590
我给了你机会...
I gave you the chance...

653
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,400
自愿帮助我...
...of aiding me willingly...

654
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,210
但是你却选择了痛苦！
...but you have elected the way of pain!

655
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,560
佛罗多先生？
Mr. Frodo?

656
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,930
佛罗多？佛罗多！
Frodo? Frodo!

657
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:42,700
我以为把你跟丢了
I thought I'd lost you. 

658
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,600
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

659
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,470
甘道夫跟我说过
It's just something Gandalf said. 

660
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,770
他说什么？
What did he say?

661
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:52,480
“紧跟着他 山姆卫斯・詹吉” 我会紧跟着你
"Don't you lose him,Samwise Gamgee." And I don't mean to.

662
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:56,380
山姆 我们还在夏尔 能有什么事？
Sam,we're still in the Shire. What could possibly happen?

663
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,380
佛罗多
Frodo.

664
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,030
梅里 是佛罗多・巴金斯
Merry,it's Frodo Baggins. 

665
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:02,890
哈罗 佛罗多
Hello,Frodo.

666
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:04,460
快起来
Get off him.

667
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,450
起来 佛罗多
Come on,Frodo.

668
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,490
这是什么意思？
What's the meaning of this?

669
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:12,060
你们偷摘老农夫马嘎的菜！
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

670
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,360
你们再敢回来！
You get back here!

671
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,670
快滚出我的菜地！
Get out of my field!

672
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:20,670
你们最好小心点别让我抓到！
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

673
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,850
我不知道他干嘛那么生气 只是两根胡萝卜
I don't know why he's so upset. It's only a couple of carrots.

674
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,140
还有几棵包心菜
And some cabbages.

675
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,280
和上礼拜我们挖的三袋马铃薯
And those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week.

676
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,030
还有上上礼拜的蘑菇
And then the mushrooms the week before. 

677
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,480
对 皮聘 重点是...
Yes,Pippin. My point is...

678
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,880
他太小题大作了
...he's clearly overreacting.

679
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:36,580
快跑！
Run!

680
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,600
好险啊
Oh,that was close.

681
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,800
我好像摔断了什么
I think I've broken something.

682
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,180
布兰迪巴克和图克家最会惹麻烦！
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

683
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:04,010
什么？那是一个便道 一条捷径呢
What? That was just a detour. A short cut.

684
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,450
去哪儿的捷径？
Short cut to what? 

685
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:06,450
蘑菇！
Mushrooms!

686
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,690
那是我的
That's mine.

687
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:21,060
那个不错 梅里
That's nice,Merry.

688
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,760
这里也有一个不错的 山姆
Here's a nice one,Sam.

689
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,370
我们最好躲起来
I think we should get off the road.

690
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,950
躲起来！
Get off the road!

691
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,640
快点！
Quick!

692
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,820
别出声！
Be quiet!

693
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,300
那是什么东西？
What was that?

694
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,750
有什么东西吗？
Anything?

695
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:37,920
什么也没有
Nothing.

696
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,930
这是怎么回事？
What is going on?

697
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:45,270
黑骑士在找什么东西或是什么人
That Black Rider was looking for something. Or someone.

698
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,100
佛罗多？
Frodo?

699
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,840
趴下！
Get down!

700
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,960
我一定要离开夏尔
I have to leave the Shire.

701
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:12,300
山姆和我要赶到布理
Sam and I must get to Bree.

702
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:13,960
好
Right.

703
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,570
巴寇伯理渡口 跟我来
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

704
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,180
快跑！
Run!

705
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,410
这儿！跟我来！
This way! Follow me!

706
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,010
快跑！
Run!

707
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,100
快去松绳 山姆！
Get the rope,Sam!

708
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,270
佛罗多！
Frodo!

709
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,410
快跑！佛罗多！
Run,Frodo!

710
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:57,840
快！快点！
Go! Hurry!

711
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:00,640
佛罗多 快跑！
Frodo,come on!

712
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,610
快！快点！跳！
Come on! Faster! Jump!

713
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:19,730
最近的渡桥有多远？
How far to the nearest crossing? 

714
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,730
烈酒桥 二十里
The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

715
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:38,840
来吧
Come on.

716
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:51,490
你们要干什么？
What do you want? 

717
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:53,490
我们要去跃马旅店
We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

718
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:59,840
哈比人 四个哈比人！
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

719
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:04,230
这么说 你们离开夏尔了 什么风把你们吹到布理的？
What's more,out of the Shire by your talk. What business brings you to Bree?

720
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,740
我们只是想住旅店
We wish to stay at the inn.

721
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,540
我们的事你管不着
Our business is our own.

722
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,240
好吧 年轻人 我不是想找事
All right,young sir. I meant no offense.

723
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,950
天黑后我就得多问一下
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.

724
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,020
听说附近有怪人游荡
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

725
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:19,350
小心一点比较好
Can't be too careful.

726
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:42,540
让开！看好你的路
Out of the way! Watch where you're walking.

727
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,490
（跃马旅店）

728
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,170
打扰了
Excuse me.

729
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,010
晚上好 小客官 需要什么？
Good evening,little masters. What can I do for you?

730
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:18,280
如果你们想住一宿 我们有舒适的哈比人房间
If you're seeking accommodation,we got some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

731
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:23,150
包君满意 请问大名是...
Always proud to cater to the Little Folk,Mister...?

732
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,290
山下 我叫山下
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

733
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,590
山下
Underhill,yes. 

734
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,090
我们是灰袍巫师甘道夫的朋友
We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

735
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:31,830
你能告诉他我们来了吗？
Can you tell him we've arrived? 

736
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,430
甘道夫？
Gandalf?

737
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,600
甘道夫
Gandalf.

738
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:38,100
哦 对...
Oh,yes...

739
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:40,370
我想起来了 有点老
...I remember. Elderly chap.

740
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,680
长长的灰胡子 尖尖的帽子
Big grey beard,pointy hat.

741
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,880
半年没见到他了
Not seen him for six months.

742
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:53,990
我们现在怎么办？
What do we do now?

743
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,460
山姆
Sam...

744
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,500
他一定会来的
...he'll be here. He'll come.

745
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,330
别挡我的路！
Get out of my way!

746
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:13,370
那是什么？
What's that?

747
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,130
这个 我的朋友 是一品脱
This,my friend,is a pint.

748
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,900
这个是按品脱的？
It comes in pints?

749
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:19,410
我也要来一品脱
I'm getting one. 

750
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:22,010
你已经喝了大半杯了！
You got a whole half already!

751
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:32,190
我们来了之后 那个人一直盯着你
That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived.

752
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,220
请问一下
Excuse me.

753
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:42,030
角落的那个人 他是谁？
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

754
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:47,570
他是一个游侠 他们很危险 成天在荒野游荡
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous folk,wandering the Wilds.

755
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,370
我不知道他的真名 但是这儿的人都叫他神行客
What his right name is,I've never heard,but around here he's known as Strider.

756
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:55,940
神行客
Strider.

757
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:12,230
巴金斯
Baggins.

758
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,230
巴金斯
Baggins.

759
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:32,220
巴金斯？当然 我认识一个
Baggins? Sure,I know a Baggins.

760
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,490
他就在那儿 佛罗多・巴金斯
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

761
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,750
他是我二表弟 一次搬到他妈妈那边...
He's my second cousin,once removed on his mother's side...

762
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:41,190
而我三表弟 两次搬到...
...and my third cousin,twice removed....

763
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:46,460
皮聘！
Pippin!

764
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,460
慢点 佛罗多
Steady on,Frodo.

765
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,490
你躲不了的
You cannot hide.

766
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,530
我看得见你
I see you.

767
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,970
这里没有生命
There is no life...

768
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,340
在虚空中
...in the void.

769
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:34,000
只有...
Only...

770
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,440
死亡
...death.

771
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:47,330
你太惹人注意了 “山下先生”
You draw far too much attention to yourself,"Mr. Underhill."

772
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,030
你想要干什么？
What do you want?

773
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,260
我要你小心点 你戴的不是小玩意
A little more caution from you. That is no trinket you carry.

774
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:56,760
我什么也没戴
I carry nothing. 

775
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:58,660
才怪
Indeed.

776
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:01,500
有必要我也能不被看到
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

777
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,370
但是完全消失可不是一件易事
...but to disappear entirely,that is a rare gift.

778
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,710
你是谁？
Who are you? 

779
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,510
你害怕了？
Are you frightened?

780
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,740
是
Yes.

781
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,860
恐怕还不够 我知道谁在找你
Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.

782
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:21,390
放开他！否则我让你好看 长腿人
Let him go! Or I'll have you,Longshanks.

783
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:27,200
你很有胆量 小哈比人 但是这救不了你
You have a stout heart,little Hobbit. But that will not save you.

784
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:30,340
你不能再等巫师了 佛罗多
You can no longer wait for the wizard,Frodo.

785
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,560
他们来了
They're coming.

786
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,650
他们是什么东西？
What are they?

787
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:00,950
他们曾经是人类
They were once Men.

788
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,390
人类伟大的国王
Great kings of Men.

789
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,030
但是索伦给了他们九只魔戒
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power.

790
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,760
他们利欲熏心 毫不怀疑地收下
Blinded by their greed,they took them without question.

791
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:14,310
一个接一个 都沉沦于黑暗
One by one,falling into darkness.

792
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,970
现在他们是索伦的奴仆
Now they are slaves to his will.

793
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:21,040
他们是戒灵
They are the Nazg?l.

794
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,980
介于生与死之间
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

795
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,210
他们随时能感受到
At all times they feel...

796
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,320
魔戒的存在
... the presence of the Ring...

797
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:33,020
被至尊魔戒吸引着 他们会一直追杀你
...drawn to the power of the One. They will never stop hunting you.

798
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,170
你要带我们去哪儿?
Where are you taking us? 

799
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:45,970
去荒野
Into the Wild.

800
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:58,210
我们怎么知道这个神行客是甘道夫的朋友？
How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?

801
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:01,220
我觉得敌人的爪牙会表面和善
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...

802
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,930
但内心凶恶
...and feel fouler.

803
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:05,530
他已经够凶恶了
He's foul enough.

804
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:09,000
我们除了相信他没有选择
We have no choice but to trust him.

805
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,570
他要带我们去哪里？
But where is he leading us? 

806
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,570
瑞文戴尔 詹吉大师
To Rivendell,Master Gamgee.

807
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:15,970
去爱隆的家
To the house of Elrond.

808
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:18,240
你们听到了吗？瑞文戴尔
Did you hear that? Rivendell.

809
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,270
我们要去见精灵
We're going to see the Elves.

810
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:46,460
各位 天黑才能歇脚
Gentlemen,we do not stop till nightfall. 

811
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:47,460
那早餐怎么办？
What about breakfast?

812
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,770
你们已经吃过了
You've already had it. 

813
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,370
我们是吃过一顿
We've had one,yes.

814
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,730
那第二顿早餐呢？
What about second breakfast?

815
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:59,310
他不知道有第二顿早餐 皮聘
Don't think he knows about second breakfast,Pip.

816
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:04,750
那早午餐呢？午餐？下午茶？晚餐？宵夜？
What about elevenses? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

817
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:06,520
他应该知道吧
He knows about them,doesn't he? 

818
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,120
我看不见得
I wouldn't count on it.

819
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,220
皮聘！
Pippin!

820
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:36,180
没有哈比人它们都吃些什么呢？
What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?

821
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:54,880
蒂努薇尔美精灵
Tinúviel elvanui

822
01:07:56,050 --> 01:08:03,030
独步群芳真智慧 
Elleth alfirin ethelhael

823
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:10,550
轻丝如瀑洒贝伦
O hon ring finnil fuinui

824
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:14,980
玉臂轻摇闪银辉
A renc gelebrin thiliol

825
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,220
她是谁？
Who is she?

826
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,520
你歌中所唱的女子
This woman you sing of.

827
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:26,370
露西安
'Tis the lady of Lúthien.

828
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:31,700
一个爱上凡人贝伦的女精灵
The Elf-maiden who gave her love to Beren,a mortal.

829
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,670
她后来怎么了？
What happened to her?

830
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,370
她死了
She died.

831
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,750
快睡吧 佛罗多
Get some sleep,Frodo.

832
01:08:57,030 --> 01:09:01,130
艾辛格听您的命令
The power of Isengard is at your command...

833
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:05,740
黑暗魔君索伦
... Sauron,Lord of the Earth.

834
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:14,880
替我召集一支魔多大军
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

835
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:24,920
魔多有什么命令 主人？魔眼有什么吩咐？
What orders from Mordor,my lord? What does the Eye command?

836
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:27,290
我们有很多事要做
We have work to do.

837
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:14,570
这些树非常坚韧 主人 树根很深
The trees are strong,my lord. Their roots go deep.

838
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,780
把它们全都拉倒
Rip them all down.

839
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:47,110
这是风云顶t望台
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sul.

840
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:51,440
今晚在这里过夜
We shall rest here tonight.

841
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,560
这些给你们 一定要随身佩带
These are for you. Keep them close.

842
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,290
我到四周看一下
I'm going to have a look around.

843
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:13,530
别乱跑
Stay here.

844
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:18,000
我的蕃茄熟了
My tomato's burst.

845
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:20,470
我能来点熏肉吗？
Could I have some bacon?

846
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,540
吃蕃茄吗 山姆？
Want a tomato,Sam?

847
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:23,940
你们在干什么？！
What are you doing?! 

848
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:26,640
烤蕃茄 香肠和熏肉
Tomatoes,sausages,nice crispy bacon.

849
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,180
我们给你留了一些 佛罗多先生
We saved some for you,Mr. Frodo. 

850
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:30,060
快把火熄掉 笨蛋！快熄掉！
Put it out,you fools! Put it out!

851
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,680
这下可好了！蕃茄上都是灰！
That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

852
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,860
快走！
Go!

853
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:38,780
退后 你们这些恶魔！
Back,you devils!

854
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:39,080
- 在冰冷和黑暗中没有生命
- 这里只有死亡！　　　　
- Gu kibum kelkum-ishi,burzum-ishi.Akha - gum-ishi ashi gurum.

855
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:03,500
佛罗多！
Frodo!

856
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,470
山姆
Oh,Sam.

857
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,510
神行客！
Strider!

858
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:51,750
快救救他 神行客
Help him,Strider. 

859
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:55,750
他被魔窟剑刺中了
He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

860
01:14:57,230 --> 01:15:02,130
我救不了他 他需要精灵的医治
This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs Elvish medicine.

861
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:07,760
快点！
Hurry!

862
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,940
还有六天到瑞文戴尔！他撑不下去！
We're six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it!

863
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,040
坚持住 佛罗多
Hold on,Frodo.

864
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,600
甘道夫！
Gandalf!

865
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,700
你看 佛罗多 这就是比尔博先生说的巨魔
Look,Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

866
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:02,740
佛罗多先生？他好冰冷
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

867
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:07,380
他会死吗？
Is he going to die?

868
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:12,450
他正在进入幽界 很快也会成为他们那样的亡灵
He's passing into the Shadow World. He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

869
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:18,360
他们就在附近
They're close. 

870
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:21,460
山姆 你知道阿夕位斯草吗？
Sam,do you know the Athelas plant?

871
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:22,220
阿夕位斯？
Athelas? 

872
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:23,120
又叫王之剑
Kingsfoil.

873
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,390
王之剑 对 是一种草药
Kingsfoil,aye,it's a weed.

874
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:27,760
它能减缓毒性发作 快去找！
It may help to slow the poisoning. Hurry!

875
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:46,280
怎么了？一个游侠竟然毫无防备？
What's this? A Ranger caught off his guard?

876
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:12,170
佛罗多
Frodo.

877
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,980
我是亚玟 我是来帮助你的
I'm Arwen. Telin le thaed

878
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:21,390
聆听我的呼唤...
Lasto beth n?n...

879
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,890
回到光明之处
Tolo dan na ngalad

880
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,860
她是谁？
Who is she?

881
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,300
佛罗多
Frodo.

882
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:34,760
她是个精灵
She's an Elf. 

883
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:37,060
他越来越衰弱了
He's fading.

884
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:41,540
他撑不了多久
He's not going to last.

885
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:44,400
我们一定要带他去找我父亲
We must get him to my father.

886
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:46,450
我找了你两天
I've been looking for you for two days. 

887
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:47,850
你要带他去哪儿？
Where are you taking him?

888
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:54,350
有五个戒灵在跟着你 我不知道另外四个在哪里
There are five Wraiths behind you. Where the other four are,I do not know.

889
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:57,590
陪着哈比人 我会给你们送马来
Dartho guin perian. Rych le ad tolthathon.

890
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:59,560
我骑马更快 我带他走
Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im.

891
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,730
路上太危险了
Andelu i ven.

892
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,300
他们在说什么？
What are they saying?

893
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,490
佛罗多快死了 如果我能渡过河...
Frodo f?r. Ae athradon i hir

894
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:08,230
我族人的力量就能保护他
tur gwaith nin beriatha hon.

895
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,130
我不怕他们
I do not fear them.

896
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:15,730
那好吧
Be iest l?n.

897
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,350
亚玟
Arwen...

898
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,710
拼命骑 别回头
...ride hard. Don't look back.

899
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,710
飞奔吧 阿斯法洛斯 飞奔吧！
Noro lim,Asfaloth,noro lim!

900
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:35,090
你在干嘛？！那些戒灵就在附近！
What are you doing?! Those Wraiths are still out there!

901
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:46,890
飞奔吧 阿斯法洛斯！
Noro lim,Asfaloth!

902
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:32,470
把半身人交给我 女精灵
Give up the halfling,She-Elf.

903
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,970
如果你要他 过来求他啊
If you want him,come and claim him.

904
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:53,160
迷雾山脉的流水啊 聆听此圣言
Nin o Chithaeglir,lasto beth daer,

905
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:58,870
涨起河水向戒灵进攻！
Rimmo nin Bruinen,dan in Ulair!

906
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:32,360
不 不！
No. No!

907
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,910
佛罗多 不！
Frodo,no.

908
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:40,410
佛罗多 别放弃！
Frodo,don't give in.

909
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:42,610
现在不行
Not now.

910
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:56,050
给予我的恩赐
What grace is given me...

911
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:58,560
请传递给他
...let it pass to him.

912
01:23:58,770 --> 01:24:00,930
让他免遭厄运
Let him be spared.

913
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:03,590
拯救他
Save him.

914
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:07,690
聆听我的呼唤
Lasto beth n?n.

915
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:09,590
回到光明之处
Tolo dan na ngalad.

916
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:17,080
我在哪里？
Where am l? 

917
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:21,180
你在爱隆王的家中
You are in the house of Elrond.

918
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:28,230
现在是10月24日早上10点 如果你想知道
And it is 10:00 in the morning on October 24th,if you want to know.

919
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:30,820
甘道夫！
Gandalf! 

920
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:33,830
是 我在这儿
Yes,I'm here.

921
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,600
你能在这里真是幸运
And you're lucky to be here too.

922
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:43,270
再过几小时你就没救了
A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid.

923
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:47,610
不过你的生命力真是强 我亲爱的哈比人
But you have some strength in you,my dear Hobbit.

924
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:57,610
发生了什么事 甘道夫？
What happened,Gandalf?

925
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,300
你怎么没去找我们？
Why didn't you meet us? 

926
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:04,100
对不起 佛罗多
I am sorry,Frodo.

927
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,530
我有事耽搁了
I was delayed.

928
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:15,640
你不能随便和我绝交
A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.

929
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:24,480
别再抗拒了 没有用的
One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

930
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:27,520
拥抱魔戒...
Embrace the power of the Ring...

931
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,650
或者拥抱你自己的毁灭！
...or embrace your own destruction!

932
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:36,830
世上只有一个魔戒之王
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

933
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:41,020
只有他能够驾驭魔戒
Only one who can bend it to his will.

934
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:45,840
他不会和你分享权力
And he does not share power.

935
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:03,520
所以你选择了死亡
So you have chosen death.

936
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,400
甘道夫？怎么了？
Gandalf? What is it?

937
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:20,170
没什么 佛罗多
Nothing,Frodo.

938
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:21,440
佛罗多！
Frodo!

939
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:23,940
佛罗多！
Frodo!

940
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:24,480
山姆
Sam. 

941
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,480
老天保佑你终于醒了！
Bless you,you're awake!

942
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:29,440
山姆一直守在你身边
Sam has hardly left your side.

943
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,810
我们好担心你 对吧 甘道夫先生？
We were that worried about you. Weren't we,Mr. Gandalf?

944
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:37,320
幸好有爱隆王 你开始痊愈了
By the skills of Lord Elrond,you're beginning to mend.

945
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:42,420
欢迎光临瑞文戴尔 佛罗多・巴金斯
Welcome to Rivendell,Frodo Baggins.

946
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:31,110
比尔博！
Bilbo! 

947
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:33,810
哈喽 佛罗多 我的孩子
Hello,Frodo,my lad.

948
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,680
比尔博
Bilbo.

949
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:42,450
去而复返...
"There and Back Again:

950
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:45,450
哈比人的故事 比尔博・巴金斯著
A Hobbit's Tale,by Bilbo Baggins."

951
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:49,560
太棒了
This is wonderful. 

952
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:52,060
我很想再回去
I meant to go back...

953
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:56,200
我很想再去幽暗密林一趟
...wander the paths of Mirkwood...

954
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,970
探访长湖镇
...visit Lake-town...

955
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:02,570
再看一眼孤山
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

956
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:07,910
但是我终于年老力衰了
But age,it seems,has finally caught up with me.

957
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:14,280
（夏尔）

958
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:21,820
我想念夏尔
I miss the Shire.

959
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:27,390
我从小就幻想我能到别的地方
I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else.

960
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:31,300
跟你一起去冒险
Off with you,on one of your adventures.

961
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:37,840
但我自己的冒险却不是这么回事
But my own adventure turned out to be quite different.

962
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:46,250
我跟你不一样 比尔博
I'm not like you,Bilbo.

963
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:49,690
我亲爱的孩子
My dear boy.

964
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:55,360
我还忘了什么？
Now,what have I forgotten? 

965
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:57,460
包裹好了？
Packed already?

966
01:28:58,570 --> 01:29:00,360
做好准备总没什么坏处
No harm in being prepared.

967
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:02,330
你不是很想看看精灵吗 山姆？
I thought you wanted to see the Elves. 

968
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:03,130
是啊
I do.

969
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:04,400
你想看得不得了
More than anything. 

970
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,000
是啊
I did.

971
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:08,340
只是...
It's just....

972
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:11,700
我们照甘道夫说的做了 不是吗？
We did what Gandalf wanted,didn't we?

973
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:15,580
我们把魔戒带到瑞文戴尔 我觉得...
We got the Ring this far,to Rivendell. And I thought...

974
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:19,080
你的伤快好了 我们也该走了
...seeing as how you're on the mend,we'd be off soon.

975
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:20,980
回家
Off home.

976
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,150
你说的对 山姆
You are right,Sam.

977
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,090
我们完成了任务
We did what we set out to do.

978
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:35,230
魔戒在瑞文戴尔很安全
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

979
01:29:39,370 --> 01:29:41,670
我也准备好回家了
I am ready to go home.

980
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,500
他的体力恢复了
His strength returns.

981
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:50,410
但他的伤永远无法痊愈 一辈子都会跟着他
That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life.

982
01:29:50,990 --> 01:29:53,510
经过这一路的冒险
And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...

983
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:57,420
证明哈比人能抗拒魔戒的诱惑
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.

984
01:29:57,630 --> 01:30:00,990
他不该背负这个重担
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

985
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,130
我们不能再要求佛罗多了
We can ask no more of Frodo. 

986
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,630
甘道夫 敌人正在行动
Gandalf,the enemy is moving.

987
01:30:06,830 --> 01:30:11,500
索伦大军在东方集结 他的邪跟正在盯着瑞文戴尔
Sauron's forces are massing in the East. His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

988
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:14,470
还有萨鲁曼 你告诉我 也背叛了我们
And Saruman,you tell me,has betrayed us.

989
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,910
我们的盟友越来越少
Our list of allies grows thin.

990
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:21,640
他的变节比你知道的还要严重
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

991
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:25,480
通过邪恶的手段 他把半兽人和怪兽混在一起
By foul craft,Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

992
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:28,130
在艾辛格的洞窟中培育了一支军队
He's breeding an army in the caverns of lsengard.

993
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:32,820
一支能在白天出没的劲旅
An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.

994
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:35,430
萨鲁曼要来抢夺至尊魔戒
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

995
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:39,930
精灵无法抵抗这股邪恶力量
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves.

996
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:44,500
我们没有力量对抗魔多和艾辛格！
We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and lsengard!

997
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:49,430
甘道夫
Gandalf...

998
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:53,300
至尊魔戒不能留在这儿
...the Ring cannot stay here.

999
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:16,060
整个中土世界都受到威胁
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

1000
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:19,000
他们必须决定如何拯救世界
They must decide now how to end it.

1001
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:23,900
精灵的时代结束了 我的族人要离开这个海港
The time of the Elves is over. My people are leaving these shores.

1002
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,870
我们走了你们要向谁求救？矮人族吗？
Who will you look to when we've gone? The Dwarves?

1003
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:33,180
他们都躲在山洞挖宝藏 一点都不关心别人的问题
They hide in mountains seeking riches. They care not for the troubles of others.

1004
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:37,620
我们要把希望放在人类身上
It is in Men that we must place our hope.

1005
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:39,690
人类？
Men?

1006
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,790
人类太脆弱了 他们的种族正在衰亡
Men are weak. The race of Men is failing.

1007
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,600
登丹人的血液不再纯正 他们的骄傲和荣耀早被遗忘
The blood of Númenor is all but spent,its pride and dignity forgotten.

1008
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:52,230
魔戒幸存都是因为人类
It is because of Men the Ring survives.

1009
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,230
当时我也在场 甘道夫
I was there,Gandalf.

1010
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:57,580
三千年前我也在场
I was there 3000 years ago...

1011
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:06,820
埃西铎取走至尊魔戒
... when Isildur took the Ring.

1012
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:10,890
人类堕落的那天我也在场
I was there the day the strength of Men failed.

1013
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:16,020
埃西铎 快！跟我来
Isildur,hurry! Follow me.

1014
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,230
我带埃西铎来到末日火山
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

1015
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:25,000
只有在那里才能摧毁至尊魔戒
... where the Ring was forged,the one place it could be destroyed.

1016
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:27,570
把它丢进烈焰中！
Cast it into the fire!

1017
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:34,100
毁了它！
Destroy it!

1018
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:36,750
不
No.

1019
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:40,250
埃西铎！
Isildur!

1020
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:45,420
那天就该结束一切 但是邪恶却存活下去
It should have ended that day,but evil was allowed to endure.

1021
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:54,200
埃西铎占有了至尊魔戒 皇室血脉就此断绝
Isildur kept the Ring. The line of kings is broken.

1022
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:58,360
人类早已失去力量
There's no strength left in the world of Men.

1023
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:00,370
他们群龙无首四处流窜
They're scattered,divided,leaderless. 

1024
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:03,370
还有一个人能让他们联合
There is one who could unite them.

1025
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:06,940
有一个人能继承刚铎王位
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

1026
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:12,450
但他早已放弃王位了
He turned from that path a long time ago.

1027
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:14,780
他选择自我放逐
He has chosen exile.

1028
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,840
你不是精灵
You are no Elf.

1029
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:50,110
我是南方来的人类
Men of the South are welcome here.

1030
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:51,750
你是谁？
Who are you? 

1031
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,250
我是灰袍巫师甘道夫的朋友
I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

1032
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:58,530
那我们来的目的一样
Then we are here on common purpose...

1033
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:00,370
朋友
...friend.

1034
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:18,520
纳希尔圣剑的碎片
The shards of Narsil.

1035
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:26,460
这把利刃砍断索伦的手指
The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.

1036
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,590
它还是很锋利
It's still sharp.

1037
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:43,570
但也只是个残缺的宝物
But no more than a broken heirloom.

1038
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,430
你为什么害怕过去？
Why do you fear the past?

1039
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:19,710
你是埃西铎的后代 而不是埃西铎
You are lsildur's heir,not lsildur himself.

1040
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:23,310
你不会重蹈他的覆辙
You are not bound to his fate.

1041
01:35:23,850 --> 01:35:27,810
我身上流着跟他一样的血
The same blood flows in my veins.

1042
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:33,420
一样的软弱
The same weakness.

1043
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:38,930
你的时代会来临的
Your time will come.

1044
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:43,700
你会面对同样的邪恶 而你会击败它
You will face the same evil. And you will defeat it.

1045
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:48,780
阴影还没有控制一切
A si i-Dhúath ú orthor,Aragorn.

1046
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:53,590
没有笼罩你...没有笼罩我
ú or le a ú or nin.

1047
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:07,980
你记得我们第一次见面吗？
Renech i lu i erui govannen?

1048
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:16,080
我以为自己迷失在梦境中
Nauthannem i ned ol reniannen.

1049
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:19,160
这么多年过去了
Gwenwin in enninath…

1050
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:24,340
你那时没有现在的忧虑
U-arnech in naeth i si celich.

1051
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:27,840
你还记得我说过什么吗？
Renech i beth i pennen?

1052
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,720
你说你愿意跟我一起
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

1053
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:43,730
放弃精灵的不朽生命
...forsaking the immortal life of your people.

1054
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:46,820
我仍愿意这么做
And to that I hold.

1055
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,600
我宁愿和你共度一生
I would rather share one lifetime with you...

1056
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:54,670
也不愿面对永生不死的孤寂
...than face all the Ages of this world alone.

1057
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:06,910
我选择凡人的生活
I choose a mortal life.

1058
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:09,680
你不能给我这个
You cannot give me this. 

1059
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:12,520
这是我的选择
It is mine to give to whom I will...

1060
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:18,250
如同我的心
...like my heart.

1061
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:37,740
来自远方的陌生人和老朋友
Strangers from distant lands,friends of old...

1062
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:41,910
你们要商议如何对抗魔多
...you've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.

1063
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:47,430
中土世界正面临灭亡的命运 无人能幸免
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it.

1064
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:51,150
你们不团结就会遭到灭亡
You will unite,or you will fall.

1065
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:55,630
每一个种族都关系着这个灾难 这个厄运
Each race is bound to this fate,this one doom.

1066
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:01,000
把魔戒拿来 佛罗多
Bring forth the Ring,Frodo.

1067
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:16,780
这果然是真的
So it is true.

1068
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:36,330
我曾经在梦中
In a dream...

1069
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:41,180
看到东方的天空暗淡
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

1070
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,180
但是西方却只有一线微光
...but in the West a pale light lingered.

1071
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:45,780
有一个声音在呐喊
A voice was crying:

1072
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:48,950
你即将面临灭亡的命运
"Your doom is near at hand.

1073
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:52,690
埃西铎克星已被寻获
Isildur's Bane is found."

1074
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:58,530
埃西铎克星
Isildur's Bane.

1075
01:38:59,130 --> 01:38:59,630
波罗莫！
Boromir!

1076
01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:02,130
至尊戒驭众戒
Ash nazg durbatul?k

1077
01:39:03,130 --> 01:39:06,430
至尊戒寻众戒
ash nazg gimbatul

1078
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:09,630
至尊戒引众戒
ash nazg thrakatuluk

1079
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:17,430
禁锢众戒黑暗中
agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.

1080
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:27,390
从来没有人敢在这里说出魔多的邪恶魔音
Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in lmladris.

1081
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:31,330
我并不想请求你的原谅 爱隆王
I do not ask your pardon,Master Elrond...

1082
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,590
因为魔多的邪恶魔音
...for the Black Speech of Mordor...

1083
01:39:33,870 --> 01:39:35,270
也许很快就会
...may yet be heard...

1084
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,400
响彻整个西方世界！
...in every corner of the West!

1085
01:39:38,570 --> 01:39:41,270
魔戒是一种邪恶力量
The Ring is altogether evil.

1086
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:43,100
它是一个礼物
It is a gift.

1087
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:45,770
一个对抗魔多的礼物
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

1088
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,510
何不利用这只魔戒？
Why not use this Ring?

1089
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:51,480
我父亲是刚铎的摄政王
Long has my father,the Steward of Gondor...

1090
01:39:51,690 --> 01:39:56,020
他一直奋力和魔多抗争 我们流着鲜血
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the blood of our people...

1091
01:39:56,260 --> 01:39:58,520
保护你们的安全
...are your lands kept safe.

1092
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:04,630
把敌人的武器交给刚铎 让我们利用它来对抗邪恶
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy. Let us use it against him.

1093
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:08,600
你无法使用它 我们谁都不能
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

1094
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:13,260
至尊魔戒只听从索伦 它没有第二个主人
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master.

1095
01:40:13,510 --> 01:40:17,030
区区一个游侠懂什么？
And what would a Ranger know of this matter?

1096
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:19,300
他不只是游侠
This is no mere Ranger.

1097
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:23,940
他是阿拉贡 阿拉松之子
He is Aragorn,son of Arathorn.

1098
01:40:24,450 --> 01:40:27,390
你应该对他效忠
You owe him your allegiance.

1099
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:33,390
阿拉贡
Aragorn.

1100
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,960
你是埃西铎的后代？
This is lsildur's heir?

1101
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:43,060
也是刚铎的王位继承人
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

1102
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:46,260
坐下 勒苟拉斯
Havo dad,Legolas

1103
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:52,780
刚铎没有国王
Gondor has no king.

1104
01:40:54,650 --> 01:40:56,340
刚铎也不需要国王
Gondor needs no king.

1105
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:06,690
阿拉贡说得对 我们不能使用魔戒
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1106
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:11,190
你们只有一个选择
You have only one choice.

1107
01:41:11,430 --> 01:41:13,760
至尊魔戒一定要摧毁
The Ring must be destroyed.

1108
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:21,600
那我们还等什么？
What are we waiting for?

1109
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:36,710
魔戒不可能被毁掉 金雳 葛罗音之子...
The Ring cannot be destroyed,Gimli,son of Glóin...

1110
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,150
用在场的任何武器
...by any craft that we here possess.

1111
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:45,830
魔戒是末日火山的烈焰铸成
The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

1112
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:49,870
也只有在那儿才能摧毁它
Only there can it be unmade.

1113
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:53,530
一定要深入魔多
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1114
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:58,700
把魔戒丢进末日火山的烈焰中
...and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.

1115
01:42:00,710 --> 01:42:02,710
你们中的一个
One of you...

1116
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:05,380
必须去
...must do this.

1117
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:12,020
一个人不可能就这样闯进魔多
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1118
01:42:12,930 --> 01:42:16,560
黑门不光有半兽人看守
Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.

1119
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:21,530
还有永不松懈的邪恶力量
There is evil there that does not sleep.

1120
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:26,000
索伦的邪眼更是虎视眈眈
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

1121
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,770
那是一片死寂的荒原
It is a barren wasteland...

1122
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:32,570
布满烈焰 灰烬和尘埃
...riddled with fire,and ash and dust.

1123
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:36,650
你呼吸的空气就是毒气
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

1124
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:41,150
就算有千军万马也办不到 这是不可能的
Not with 10,000 men could you do this. It is folly.

1125
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:45,850
你没听到爱隆王说的话吗？一定要摧毁魔戒
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

1126
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:48,590
我还以为你是那个救世主呢！
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

1127
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,460
如果我们失败了怎么办？魔戒被索伦抢回去怎么办？
And if we fail,what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?

1128
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:58,930
我死也不容许魔戒落入精灵手中！
I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf!

1129
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:03,430
绝不要相信精灵！
Never trust an Elf!

1130
01:43:04,610 --> 01:43:10,450
大家在这儿争吵不休 索伦的力量就会越来越强！
Do you not understand? While you bicker amongst yourselves,Sauron's power grows!

1131
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:13,690
谁都逃脱不了！你们都会遭到毁灭！
None can escape it! You'll all be destroyed!

1132
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:16,290
至尊戒驭众戒
Ash nazg durbatuluk!

1133
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:18,690
至尊戒寻众戒
Ash nazg gimbatul!

1134
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,990
至尊戒寻众戒
Ash nazg gimbatul!

1135
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,990
至尊戒寻众戒
Ash nazg gimbatul!

1136
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:25,090
至尊戒寻众戒
Ash nazg gimbatul!

1137
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,190
至尊戒寻众戒
Ash nazg gimbatul!

1138
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:28,890
至尊戒寻众戒
Ash nazg gimbatul!

1139
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:34,700
我愿意去
I will take it.

1140
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:39,200
我愿意去
I will take it.

1141
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:48,080
我愿意把魔戒带到魔多
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1142
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,420
虽然...
Though...

1143
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:02,330
我不认得路
...I do not know the way.

1144
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:08,770
我愿意帮你承受这个重担 佛罗多・巴金斯
I will help you bear this burden,Frodo Baggins...

1145
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:12,280
只要你在承受
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1146
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:16,440
如果用我的性命能保护你
If by my life or death I can protect you...

1147
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:18,510
我愿意
...I will.

1148
01:44:21,790 --> 01:44:24,050
我的剑会保护你
You have my sword.

1149
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:27,950
还有我的弓箭
And you have my bow.

1150
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:31,020
以及我的斧头
And my ax.

1151
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:41,030
你背负着大家的命运 小家伙
You carry the fates of us all,little one.

1152
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:46,710
如果这是大家真正的意愿
If this is indeed the will of the Council...

1153
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:49,670
那么刚铎也会支持他
...then Gondor will see it done.

1154
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:54,120
佛罗多先生没有我哪都不去
Frodo's not going anywhere without me. 

1155
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:56,990
没错 是很难拆散你们...
It is hardly possible to separate you...

1156
01:44:57,190 --> 01:45:02,060
连你没份参加的秘密会议你也来了
...even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not.

1157
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:04,560
我们也来了！
We're coming too!

1158
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:09,360
除非你把我们五花大绑送回家
You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.

1159
01:45:09,570 --> 01:45:12,940
总之 你需要个聪明的人来完成这个...
Anyway,you need people of intelligence on this sort of...

1160
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:14,570
任务
...mission.

1161
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:16,240
冒险
Quest.

1162
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:17,730
行动
Thing.

1163
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:22,340
那你第一个就不合格
Well,that rules you out,Pip.

1164
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:25,820
九名同伴
Nine companions.

1165
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:29,420
就这样吧
So be it.

1166
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:32,820
你们就是魔戒远征队
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.

1167
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:35,260
太棒了！
Great!

1168
01:45:35,530 --> 01:45:37,760
我们要去哪儿？
Where are we going?

1169
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:22,610
她希望保护她的孩子...
Anirne hene beriad i chên ?n.

1170
01:46:24,350 --> 01:46:28,190
她以为你在瑞文戴尔会很安全
Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen.

1171
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:34,180
你母亲知道你这一生都会遭到追杀
In her heart,your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life.

1172
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:36,390
你逃避不了这个命运
That you'd never escape your fate.

1173
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:40,490
精灵可以重新铸造王者之剑...
The skill of the Elves can reforge the sword of kings...

1174
01:46:40,970 --> 01:46:44,910
但是只有你拥有使用它的力量
...but only you have the power to wield it.

1175
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:48,380
我并不想拥有这个力量
I do not want that power.

1176
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:51,270
我从来都不想
I have never wanted it.

1177
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:55,140
你是唯一的皇族继承人 没有别人
You are the last of that bloodline. There is no other.

1178
01:46:59,690 --> 01:47:02,020
我的宝剑！刺针
My old sword! Sting.

1179
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:03,420
来 拿去 拿去
Here,take it. Take it.

1180
01:47:08,930 --> 01:47:10,000
好轻啊
It's so light. 

1181
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:12,800
没错 精灵打造的
Yes. Made by the Elves,you know.

1182
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:17,630
半兽人接近剑身就会变蓝
The blade glows blue when Orcs are close.

1183
01:47:17,870 --> 01:47:22,470
那个时候 我的孩子 你就要格外小心
And it's times like that,my lad,when you have to be extra careful.

1184
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:25,150
还有个漂亮的东西
Here's a pretty thing.

1185
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:26,840
秘银
Mithril.

1186
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:32,020
轻若鸿毛 韧如龙鳞
As light as a feather,and as hard as dragon scales.

1187
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:35,490
让我看你把它穿上 快点
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1188
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,520
我的老戒指
My old ring.

1189
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:50,740
我真的很想...
I should very much like...

1190
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:54,970
再把它握在手中 最后一次
...to hold it again,one last time.

1191
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:16,020
我很抱歉给你带来这些 我的孩子
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,my boy.

1192
01:48:16,330 --> 01:48:20,390
我很抱歉让你背负这个重担
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

1193
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:28,000
我对这一切都很抱歉
I'm sorry for everything.

1194
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:47,630
魔戒持有者要开始末日火山的征途
The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1195
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:51,360
你们这些随行的伙伴没有许下誓言...
On you who travel with him,no oath...

1196
01:48:51,370 --> 01:48:54,690
也没有受到约束规定你们一定要走完全程
...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.

1197
01:48:57,940 --> 01:49:00,430
再会了 坚守你们的目的
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1198
01:49:00,940 --> 01:49:05,280
愿精灵 人类以及所有的自由之士的...
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1199
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:08,040
祝福伴随你们
...and all Free Folk go with you.

1200
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:15,180
远征队等候魔戒持有者
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1201
01:49:33,610 --> 01:49:36,480
甘道夫 魔多是往左还是往右？
Mordor,Gandalf,is it left or right?

1202
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:38,480
左
Left.

1203
01:50:58,090 --> 01:51:02,530
我们必须向迷雾山脉以西走四十天
We must hold to this course,west of the Misty Mountains,for 40 days.

1204
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:06,430
幸运的话就能赶到洛汗隘口
If our luck holds,the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.

1205
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:10,230
从那儿往东走到魔多
From there,our road turns east to Mordor.

1206
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:14,270
二 一 五 好！非常好！
Two,one,five. Good! Very good.

1207
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:17,100
移动脚步
Move your feet.

1208
01:51:17,310 --> 01:51:18,280
你好帅哦 皮聘
You look good,Pippin. 

1209
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:18,680
谢了
Thanks.

1210
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,280
快一点！
Faster!

1211
01:51:21,620 --> 01:51:25,450
虽然你们都不问我的意见...
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,which I note they're not...

1212
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:28,380
我还是要说我们在绕远路
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

1213
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:31,950
甘道夫 我们大可以穿过摩瑞亚矿坑
Gandalf,we could pass through the Mines of Moria.

1214
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:36,460
我表哥巴林会热烈地欢迎我们
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

1215
01:51:36,670 --> 01:51:42,000
不行 金雳 别无选择才能走摩瑞亚矿坑
No,I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.

1216
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:52,440
对不起！
Sorry!

1217
01:51:53,150 --> 01:51:54,340
抓住他！
Get him!

1218
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:56,990
夏尔万岁！
For the Shire! 

1219
01:51:57,020 --> 01:51:58,590
压住他 把他压住 梅里！
Hold him. Hold him down,Merry!

1220
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:00,190
先生们 够了
Gentlemen,that's enough.

1221
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:06,850
你抓住我胳膊了！
You've got my arm! You've got my arm!

1222
01:52:07,330 --> 01:52:08,060
那是什么？
What is that? 

1223
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,960
没什么 只是一朵乌云
Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1224
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:12,630
它移动得这么快
It's moving fast.

1225
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:15,260
还迎着风
Against the wind.

1226
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:17,130
登兰德的乌鸦！
Crebain from Dunland! 

1227
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:18,130
躲起来！
Hide!

1228
01:52:18,370 --> 01:52:19,140
快点！
Hurry! 

1229
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:21,140
隐蔽起来！
Take cover!

1230
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:56,270
萨鲁曼的眼线
Spies of Saruman.

1231
01:52:57,050 --> 01:53:00,310
南方的路受到监视
The passage south is being watched.

1232
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:04,780
我们一定要攀越卡兰拉斯山
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1233
01:53:17,370 --> 01:53:19,060
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1234
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:40,380
波罗莫
Boromir.

1235
01:53:40,590 --> 01:53:44,820
我们受尽了恐惧和疑虑的折磨...
It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt...

1236
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:48,120
就为了这小玩意
...over so small a thing.

1237
01:53:51,330 --> 01:53:53,300
这小小的玩意
Such a little thing.

1238
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:54,970
波罗莫！
Boromir!

1239
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:58,230
把魔戒还给佛罗多
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1240
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:10,140
如你所愿
As you wish.

1241
01:54:10,890 --> 01:54:12,910
我才不要它
I care not.

1242
01:54:48,290 --> 01:54:52,990
甘道夫 你想带他们攀越卡兰拉斯山
So,Gandalf,you try to lead them over Caradhras.

1243
01:54:53,190 --> 01:54:57,790
要是失败 你能到哪儿？
And if that fails,where then will you go?

1244
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:02,040
要是你被高山打败...
If the mountain defeats you...

1245
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:06,710
你肯冒险走更危险的路吗？
... will you risk a more dangerous road?

1246
01:55:12,970 --> 01:55:19,310
醒来吧 残暴的红角峰！让你的尖角沾满血污！
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse!Nai yarvaxea rasselya! 

1247
01:55:19,310 --> 01:55:21,990
一股邪音从天而降
There is a fell voice on the air.

1248
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:24,550
那是萨鲁曼！
It's Saruman!

1249
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:38,330
他想制造雪崩！甘道夫 我们一定要回头！
He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf,we must turn back!

1250
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:40,200
不行！
No!

1251
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:48,400
沉睡吧 卡兰拉斯！安静吧 沉睡吧！控制你的愤怒！
Losto Caradhras,sedho,hodo,nuitho i 'ruith! 

1252
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:51,000
醒来吧 残暴的红角峰！
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse! 

1253
01:55:54,250 --> 01:56:00,400
让你那沾满血污的尖角落到敌人头上！
Nai yarvaxea rasselya taltuva notto-carinnar!

1254
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:48,510
我们一定要离开山岭！
We must get off the mountain!

1255
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:53,310
赶到洛汗隘口 从西谷到我的城市！
Make for the Gap of Rohan,and take the west road to my city!

1256
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:56,880
洛汗隘口离艾辛格太近了！
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to lsengard!

1257
01:56:57,090 --> 01:57:00,780
上面走不成就走下面吧
We cannot pass over a mountain. Let us go under it.

1258
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:03,820
让我们穿过摩瑞亚矿坑
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1259
01:57:05,660 --> 01:57:09,530
摩瑞亚 你很怕穿过矿坑
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

1260
01:57:10,130 --> 01:57:15,190
矮人太贪心 挖得太深
The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

1261
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:20,910
你知道他们在西泽督姆的黑暗中唤醒了什么
You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-d?m:

1262
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:25,670
邪恶的炎魔
Shadow and flame.

1263
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:31,780
让魔戒持有者决定
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1264
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:38,620
我们不能待在这儿！
We cannot stay here!

1265
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:41,590
我们留下来就死定了
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1266
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,420
佛罗多？
Frodo?

1267
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:49,330
我们走矿坑吧
We will go through the mines.

1268
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:52,070
就这么办吧
So be it.

1269
01:57:58,650 --> 01:58:02,510
佛罗多 过来扶扶我这老头儿
Frodo,come and help an old man.

1270
01:58:06,090 --> 01:58:08,320
你的肩伤还好吧？
How is your shoulder?

1271
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:09,720
好点了
Better than it was. 

1272
01:58:09,790 --> 01:58:11,720
魔戒呢？
And the Ring?

1273
01:58:13,330 --> 01:58:15,820
你感觉到它的力量越来越大 对吧？
You feel its power growing,don't you?

1274
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:19,170
我也感觉到了 你千万要小心
I've felt it too. You must be careful now.

1275
01:58:19,670 --> 01:58:23,540
邪恶力量不但会来自外面
Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship.

1276
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:26,260
恐怕也会来自远征队员
And,I fear,from within.

1277
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:30,070
那我该相信谁？
Who then do I trust? 

1278
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:33,070
你要相信你自己
You must trust yourself.

1279
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:36,150
相信自己的力量
Trust your own strengths.

1280
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:37,080
什么意思？
What do you mean? 

1281
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:38,880
这世上有很多力量...
There are many powers in this world...

1282
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:41,150
正义的或邪恶的
...for good or for evil.

1283
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:43,620
有些力量比我更强大
Some are greater than I am.

1284
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:47,750
有些力量连我都没有遇见过
And against some I have not yet been tested.

1285
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:50,530
摩瑞亚矿坑的...
The walls...

1286
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:53,290
墙
...of Moria.

1287
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:02,010
矮人的门关起来时是看不到的
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1288
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:06,820
没错 金雳  如果秘密被遗忘 连它们的主人都找不到
Yes,Gimli,their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten.

1289
01:59:07,050 --> 01:59:09,520
为什么我一点都不吃惊？
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1290
01:59:17,530 --> 01:59:20,860
让我看看
Well,let's see.

1291
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,460
伊希尔丁金属
Ithildin.

1292
01:59:23,060 --> 01:59:26,430
它只会反射星光和月光
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

1293
01:59:40,550 --> 01:59:44,610
上面写着：都灵之门 摩瑞亚之主
It reads,"The Doors of Durin,Lord of Moria.

1294
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:48,120
开口说 朋友 然后进入
Speak,friend,and enter. 

1295
01:59:48,130 --> 01:59:49,820
那你认为是什么意思？
What do you suppose that means?

1296
01:59:50,060 --> 01:59:54,690
很简单 如果你是朋友 说出暗语门就开了
It's simple. If you are a friend,you speak the password and the doors will open.

1297
01:59:54,860 --> 01:59:59,790
精灵的大门 现在为我打开！
Annon Edhellen edro hi ammen!

1298
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:13,590
矮人的门户 听从我的命令！
Fennas Nogothrim lasto beth lammen!

1299
02:00:18,590 --> 02:00:19,710
没有反应
Nothing's happening.

1300
02:00:26,730 --> 02:00:30,960
我以前知道所有精灵...
I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves...

1301
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:33,960
人类和半兽人的语言
...Men and Orcs.

1302
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:35,560
那你打算怎么办？
What are you going to do,then?

1303
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:38,130
用你的头把大门撞开 皮里格林・图克！
Knock your head against these doors,Peregrin Took!

1304
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:40,170
要是那样还撞不开...
And if that does not shatter them...

1305
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:43,200
那就让我安静一下 别再问愚蠢的问题...
...and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions...

1306
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:46,740
我会努力找到打开的暗语
...I will try to find the opening words.

1307
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:58,740
精灵的大门听从我的命令 矮人的入口...
Ando Eldarinwa… a lasta quettanya,Fenda Casarinwa…

1308
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:02,120
矿坑不是一匹小马待的地方
Mines are no place for a pony.

1309
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:04,160
即使它很勇敢也不行
Even one so brave as Bill. 

1310
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:06,460
再见了 比尔
Bye-bye,Bill.

1311
02:01:07,670 --> 02:01:10,430
去吧 比尔 去吧
Go on,Bill. Go on.

1312
02:01:11,010 --> 02:01:14,500
别担心 山姆 它认得回家的路
Don't worry,Sam,he knows the way home.

1313
02:01:21,350 --> 02:01:23,910
别玩水
Do not disturb the water.

1314
02:01:24,150 --> 02:01:26,020
没有用
Oh,it's useless.

1315
02:01:38,670 --> 02:01:40,830
这是一个谜语
It's a riddle.

1316
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:46,700
开口说“朋友” 然后进入
Speak 'friend' and enter.

1317
02:01:47,110 --> 02:01:50,040
“朋友”用精灵语怎么说？
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1318
02:01:51,450 --> 02:01:52,740
朋友
Mellon.

1319
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:15,700
很快 精灵大人 你就会见到矮人族的热情
Soon,Master Elf,you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1320
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:21,870
熊熊的火焰 清凉的啤酒和大块的烤肉！
Roaring fires,malt beer,ripe meat off the bone!

1321
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:26,440
这个 我的朋友 就是我表哥巴林的家
This,my friend,is the home of my cousin Balin.

1322
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:29,220
他们叫它矿坑
And they call it a mine.

1323
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:31,390
矿坑！
A mine!

1324
02:02:32,420 --> 02:02:35,750
这不是矿坑 这是坟墓
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1325
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:43,450
不...
No....

1326
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:46,360
不！
No!

1327
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,530
半兽人
Goblins.

1328
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:58,780
我们应该去洛汗隘口 我们就不应该来这儿
We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here.

1329
02:02:59,810 --> 02:03:02,410
快 从这里出去 出去！
Now,get out of here. Get out!

1330
02:03:05,190 --> 02:03:06,390
佛罗多！
Frodo! 

1331
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:07,590
救命！
Help!

1332
02:03:07,790 --> 02:03:09,420
神行客！
Strider!

1333
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:10,750
救他！
Help! 

1334
02:03:10,990 --> 02:03:12,350
放开他！
Get off him!

1335
02:03:12,530 --> 02:03:13,580
阿拉贡！
Aragorn!

1336
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:24,990
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1337
02:03:51,330 --> 02:03:52,420
快进矿坑！
Into the mines!

1338
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:53,800
勒苟拉斯！
Legolas! 

1339
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:55,800
快进山洞！
Into the cave!

1340
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:01,870
快跑！
Run!

1341
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:22,350
我们现在只有一个选择
We now have but one choice.

1342
02:04:22,530 --> 02:04:27,430
我们一定要穿过黑暗的矿坑
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1343
02:04:27,700 --> 02:04:29,670
保持警惕
Be on your guard.

1344
02:04:29,870 --> 02:04:33,510
有比半兽人更古老 更邪恶的东西...
There are older and fouler things than Orcs...

1345
02:04:33,510 --> 02:04:37,030
在这个黑暗的地底世界
...in the deep places of the world.

1346
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:48,920
安静 要走四天才能到另一边
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey to the other side.

1347
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:52,990
希望我们不会惊动什么
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

1348
02:05:38,770 --> 02:05:42,470
摩瑞亚矿坑最珍贵的不是黄金...
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1349
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:45,080
或是珠宝...
...or jewels...

1350
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:48,270
而是秘银
...but mithril.

1351
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:11,500
比尔博有一件索林给的秘银打造的锁甲
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him.

1352
02:06:11,770 --> 02:06:13,710
简直是给国王的礼物
Oh,that was a kingly gift. 

1353
02:06:13,710 --> 02:06:15,710
没错
Yes.

1354
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:17,810
我从来没跟他说过...
I never told him...

1355
02:06:17,980 --> 02:06:22,940
那件秘银远比整个夏尔更值钱
...but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.

1356
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:36,990
皮聘
Pippin.

1357
02:06:57,350 --> 02:07:00,320
我不记得这地方
I have no memory of this place.

1358
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:03,250
我们迷路了吗？
Are we lost? 

1359
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:03,820
没有
No.

1360
02:07:03,990 --> 02:07:05,120
我认为我们迷路了
I think we are. 

1361
02:07:05,190 --> 02:07:06,520
甘道夫正在想
Gandalf's thinking.

1362
02:07:06,730 --> 02:07:07,390
梅里？
Merry? 

1363
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:08,190
干嘛？
What?

1364
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:10,030
我饿了
I'm hungry.

1365
02:07:21,710 --> 02:07:23,650
下面有什么东西
There's something down there. 

1366
02:07:24,110 --> 02:07:25,850
那是咕噜
It's Gollum.

1367
02:07:26,350 --> 02:07:27,240
咕噜？
Gollum? 

1368
02:07:27,350 --> 02:07:30,440
他已经跟了我们三天
He's been following us for three days.

1369
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:33,020
他从巴拉多的地牢逃出来
He escaped the dungeons of Barad-d?r? 

1370
02:07:33,140 --> 02:07:34,850
逃出来...
Escaped...

1371
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:37,180
或是被放出来
...or was set loose.

1372
02:07:37,730 --> 02:07:41,350
现在魔戒把他带到这儿来
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1373
02:07:43,930 --> 02:07:46,730
他对魔戒永远充满渴望
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1374
02:07:46,930 --> 02:07:52,630
他对至尊魔戒又爱又恨 就像他对自己爱恨交加
He hates and loves the Ring,as he hates and loves himself.

1375
02:07:52,810 --> 02:07:57,710
史麦戈的遭遇很悲惨
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1376
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:03,820
史麦戈是他的本名 在魔戒找到他之前
Yes,Sméagol he was once called. Before the Ring found him.

1377
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:07,580
在魔戒让他发疯之前
Before it drove him mad.

1378
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:10,920
真可惜比尔博当时没杀了他
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.

1379
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:12,120
可惜？
Pity?

1380
02:08:13,190 --> 02:08:16,130
比尔博同情他才没杀他
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1381
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:22,820
有很多活人本来就该死 也有些死人本来命不该绝
Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life.

1382
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:26,440
你能安排他们的命运吗 佛罗多？
Can you give it to them,Frodo?

1383
02:08:28,580 --> 02:08:32,510
千万别轻易断定别人的生死
Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment.

1384
02:08:32,750 --> 02:08:35,650
就连智者都无法决定命运
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

1385
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:42,560
我认为咕噜会跟这趟冒险有关 不管是好是坏...
My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet,for good or ill...

1386
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:45,820
在一切结束前
...before this is over.

1387
02:08:47,330 --> 02:08:51,660
比尔博的同情可能会决定很多人的命运
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

1388
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:01,170
我真希望魔戒没在我手中
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1389
02:09:02,610 --> 02:09:04,550
真希望这一切都没发生
I wish none of this had happened.

1390
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:08,350
每个人遇到难关都会这么想...
So do all who live to see such times.

1391
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:10,570
但是那不由我们决定
But that is not for them to decide.

1392
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:12,510
我们所能决定的是...
All we have to decide is...

1393
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:16,510
在给予我们的时间内去做什么
what to do with the time that is given to us.

1394
02:09:17,690 --> 02:09:21,680
世上除了邪恶还有别的力量
There are other forces at work in this world,Frodo,besides the will of evil.

1395
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:24,530
比尔博注定要找到魔戒
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1396
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,330
你也注定要得到它
In which case,you also were meant to have it.

1397
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:32,660
能这么想就好了
And that is an encouraging thought.

1398
02:09:37,580 --> 02:09:39,250
是那条路
It's that way.

1399
02:09:39,810 --> 02:09:40,610
他记起来了
He's remembered. 

1400
02:09:40,710 --> 02:09:42,110
不是
No.

1401
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:46,120
但是这儿的空气闻起来没那么糟
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

1402
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:51,520
如果拿不准 梅里・雅达克 那就跟着你的鼻子
If in doubt,Meriadoc,always follow your nose.

1403
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:10,500
让我冒险再弄亮一点
Let me risk a little more light.

1404
02:10:15,150 --> 02:10:17,210
看吧...
Behold...

1405
02:10:17,650 --> 02:10:22,920
矮人族的宏伟领域和地下城市
...the great realm and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1406
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:28,800
这真是令人大开眼界
There's an eye opener,and no mistake.

1407
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:55,450
金雳！
Gimli!

1408
02:11:02,830 --> 02:11:04,460
不！
No!

1409
02:11:07,070 --> 02:11:10,200
不...
Oh,no.

1410
02:11:12,070 --> 02:11:13,330
不
No.

1411
02:11:20,610 --> 02:11:22,610
巴林长眠于此...
"Here lies Balin...

1412
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:25,070
方丁之子...
...son of Fundin...

1413
02:11:25,390 --> 02:11:28,010
摩瑞亚之主
...Lord of Moria."

1414
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:30,750
他死了
He is dead,then.

1415
02:11:32,490 --> 02:11:34,390
这就是我所担心的
It's as I feared.

1416
02:11:52,410 --> 02:11:55,310
我们必须离开 我们不能逗留
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1417
02:11:55,550 --> 02:12:00,250
他们攻下桥梁和第二大厅
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

1418
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:03,920
我们闩住大门...
We have barred the gates...

1419
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:07,080
但阻挡不了他们多久
...but cannot hold them for long.

1420
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:10,090
大地在撼动
The ground shakes.

1421
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:12,060
鼓声...
Drums...

1422
02:12:12,430 --> 02:12:15,800
鼓声从深处传来
...drums in the deep.

1423
02:12:19,410 --> 02:12:21,400
我们逃不出去
We cannot get out.

1424
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:27,280
一个阴影在黑暗中移动
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1425
02:12:28,950 --> 02:12:31,540
我们逃不出去
We cannot get out.

1426
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:36,450
他们来了
They are coming."

1427
02:13:19,470 --> 02:13:21,300
愚蠢的图克！
Fool of a Took!

1428
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:25,800
下次把你也扔进去 免得你的愚蠢害了我们
Throw yourself in next time,and rid us of your stupidity.

1429
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:53,190
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1430
02:13:55,540 --> 02:13:57,000
半兽人
Orcs.

1431
02:14:04,010 --> 02:14:06,000
退后！紧挨着甘道夫！
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1432
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:14,950
有一只巨魔
They have a cave-troll.

1433
02:14:30,770 --> 02:14:31,900
让它们来吧！
Let them come!

1434
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:35,930
摩瑞亚有一个矮人还喘着气呢
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath.

1435
02:16:54,850 --> 02:16:57,610
我想我要为这个被绞死
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1436
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:04,090
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1437
02:17:37,620 --> 02:17:39,490
阿拉贡！阿拉贡！
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1438
02:17:40,490 --> 02:17:42,360
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1439
02:18:27,700 --> 02:18:29,570
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1440
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:31,060
不
Oh, no.

1441
02:19:39,470 --> 02:19:41,410
他还活着
He's alive.

1442
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:46,810
我没事 我没受伤
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1443
02:19:47,050 --> 02:19:49,240
你应该没命的
You should be dead.

1444
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:51,940
那一剑连野猪都能刺死
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

1445
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:56,920
小哈比人远比我们想像的厉害
I think there's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.

1446
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:03,780
秘银
Mithril.

1447
02:20:06,630 --> 02:20:09,260
你总是叫人吃惊 巴金斯先生
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

1448
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:17,180
快到凯萨督姆桥！
To the Bridge of Khazad-d?m!

1449
02:20:32,190 --> 02:20:33,850
这边！
This way!

1450
02:21:44,260 --> 02:21:47,230
又来了什么怪物？
What is this new devilry?

1451
02:22:03,320 --> 02:22:06,110
炎魔
A Balrog.

1452
02:22:06,450 --> 02:22:09,580
远古的恶魔
A demon of the ancient world.

1453
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:14,190
你们都不是它的对手
This foe is beyond any of you.

1454
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:16,920
快跑！
Run!

1455
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:25,770
快点！
Quickly!

1456
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:43,720
甘道夫
Gandalf.

1457
02:22:44,290 --> 02:22:45,880
带领他们 阿拉贡
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1458
02:22:47,290 --> 02:22:49,780
桥就快到了
The bridge is near.

1459
02:22:51,860 --> 02:22:55,990
照我说的做！剑是无法对付炎魔的
Do as I say! Swords are no more use here.

1460
02:23:25,130 --> 02:23:26,860
甘道夫！
Gandalf!

1461
02:23:45,150 --> 02:23:46,380
梅里！皮聘！
Merry! Pippin!

1462
02:23:57,500 --> 02:23:58,990
山姆！
Sam!

1463
02:24:01,730 --> 02:24:05,000
谁也不能丢矮人
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1464
02:24:08,040 --> 02:24:09,440
别扯我的胡子！
Not the beard!

1465
02:24:22,660 --> 02:24:24,560
稳住
Steady.

1466
02:24:26,660 --> 02:24:28,320
站好！
Hold on!

1467
02:24:49,420 --> 02:24:50,610
稳住！
Hang on!

1468
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:03,090
往前倾！
Lean forward!

1469
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:07,090
稳住
Steady.

1470
02:25:08,430 --> 02:25:09,590
快点！
Come on!

1471
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:11,300
快跳！
Now!

1472
02:25:28,490 --> 02:25:30,350
快过桥！
Over the bridge!

1473
02:25:30,520 --> 02:25:32,080
快过去！
Fly!

1474
02:26:16,700 --> 02:26:18,800
你不能过去！
You cannot pass!

1475
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:20,530
甘道夫！
Gandalf!

1476
02:26:24,810 --> 02:26:29,680
我是圣火的仆人 高举着亚尔诺炽焰
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.

1477
02:26:30,680 --> 02:26:34,480
邪恶之火不会帮你 乌顿之火！
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!

1478
02:26:44,460 --> 02:26:46,430
滚回黑暗中吧
Go back to the Shadow.

1479
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:58,700
你不能过去！
You shall not pass!

1480
02:27:25,870 --> 02:27:27,070
不！不！
No! No! 

1481
02:27:27,070 --> 02:27:30,440
甘道夫！
Gandalf!

1482
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:39,880
快走啊 你这傻瓜！
Fly, you fools!

1483
02:27:43,990 --> 02:27:46,150
不！
No!

1484
02:27:52,300 --> 02:27:54,460
阿拉贡！
Aragorn!

1485
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:54,560
勒苟拉斯 把他们扶起来
Legolas, get them up.

1486
02:28:58,660 --> 02:29:00,560
让他们静一静吧！
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1487
02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:04,360
天一黑半兽人就会蜂拥而上
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with Orcs.

1488
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:07,940
我们一定要赶到罗斯洛立安森林
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1489
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:12,140
走吧 波罗莫 勒苟拉斯 金雳 把他们扶起来
Come, Boromir. Legolas. Gimli, get them up.

1490
02:29:13,650 --> 02:29:15,840
起来 山姆
On your feet, Sam.

1491
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:17,670
佛罗多？
Frodo?

1492
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:21,450
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1493
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:16,500
跟紧了 小哈比人！
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1494
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:21,370
听说一个大女巫住在这个树林
They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods.

1495
02:30:21,580 --> 02:30:24,140
一个精灵巫师...
An Elf-witch...

1496
02:30:24,680 --> 02:30:27,550
拥有可怕的法力
...of terrible power.

1497
02:30:28,090 --> 02:30:30,280
只要看她一眼...
All who look upon her...

1498
02:30:30,490 --> 02:30:32,250
就会被她的符咒击倒
...fall under her spell.

1499
02:30:32,490 --> 02:30:33,750
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1500
02:30:36,060 --> 02:30:38,050
然后永远消失
And are never seen again.

1501
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:42,760
你的到来就像毁灭的脚步
Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.

1502
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:46,730
你带来了巨大的邪恶 魔戒持有者
You bring great evil here, Ring-bearer.

1503
02:30:46,940 --> 02:30:48,700
佛罗多先生？
Mr. Frodo?

1504
02:30:53,980 --> 02:30:59,580
我这个矮人可不会被她轻易迷惑
Well, here's one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

1505
02:30:59,790 --> 02:31:04,310
我有老鹰的锐眼和狐狸的耳朵
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

1506
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:16,560
这矮人喘气声这么大 就算在黑暗中也能射死他
The Dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.

1507
02:31:21,240 --> 02:31:24,130
欢迎 勒苟拉斯 瑟兰督伊之子
Mae govannen,Legolas Thranduilion.

1508
02:31:24,190 --> 02:31:27,750
我们的远征队寻求你的帮忙 罗瑞安的哈尔达
Govannas vin gwennen le,Haldir o Lórien.

1509
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:31,910
登丹人阿拉贡...
A Aragorn in Dúnedain

1510
02:31:31,960 --> 02:31:34,050
我们久仰你的大名
istannen le ammen

1511
02:31:34,050 --> 02:31:34,710
哈尔达
Haldir.

1512
02:31:34,750 --> 02:31:37,170
精灵真如传说中的有礼貌！
So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves!

1513
02:31:37,190 --> 02:31:39,190
说我们都听得懂的话！
Speak words we can all understand!

1514
02:31:39,260 --> 02:31:43,820
自从黑暗时期我们就没跟矮人打过交道
We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1515
02:31:44,130 --> 02:31:46,620
那你知道这些矮人会怎么说吗？
And you know what this Dwarf says to that?

1516
02:31:47,030 --> 02:31:51,620
我唾弃你的坟墓！
Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul! 

1517
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:55,770
那样很没有礼貌
That was not so courteous.

1518
02:32:02,010 --> 02:32:06,040
你带来了强大的邪恶力量
You bring great evil with you.

1519
02:32:07,820 --> 02:32:10,020
你们不能再前进了
You can go no further.

1520
02:32:47,390 --> 02:32:50,020
甘道夫不是白白牺牲
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1521
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:53,100
他也不会让你放弃希望
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1522
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:57,930
你背负着沉重的担子 佛罗多
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1523
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:01,900
别再背负死亡的重担
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1524
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:06,800
你们跟我来
You will follow me.

1525
02:33:18,490 --> 02:33:20,420
卡拉斯加位顿
Caras Galadhon.

1526
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:24,020
世界上精灵王国的中心
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1527
02:33:24,030 --> 02:33:30,100
凯勒布理安王以及光明女王凯兰崔尔的国度
Realm of the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1528
02:34:49,010 --> 02:34:52,110
敌人知道你们来到这里
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1529
02:34:52,790 --> 02:34:57,950
你们已经暴露了行踪
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.

1530
02:34:59,660 --> 02:35:04,120
这儿只有八个人 但有九个人从瑞文戴尔出发
Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell.

1531
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:06,160
告诉我 甘道夫呢？
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1532
02:35:06,370 --> 02:35:09,460
我很想跟他说话
For I much desire to speak with him.

1533
02:35:09,670 --> 02:35:12,470
我很久没见过他了
I can no longer see him from afar.

1534
02:35:13,340 --> 02:35:18,500
灰袍巫师甘道夫并没有进入黄金森林
Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land.

1535
02:35:18,740 --> 02:35:21,210
他已坠入黑暗深渊
He has fallen into Shadow.

1536
02:35:25,880 --> 02:35:30,380
他被烈焰和黑暗吞噬
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1537
02:35:32,020 --> 02:35:35,720
魔苟斯的炎魔
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1538
02:35:36,500 --> 02:35:40,060
我们不小心进入摩瑞亚的陷阱
For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.

1539
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:45,230
甘道夫做事一向都很小心
Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.

1540
02:35:45,870 --> 02:35:49,170
我们还不知道他的意图
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1541
02:35:53,910 --> 02:35:58,250
别让凯萨督姆的毁灭让你灰心丧志...
Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-d?m fill your heart...

1542
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:00,750
金雳 葛罗音之子
...Gimli, son of Glóin.

1543
02:36:01,750 --> 02:36:05,280
世上到处充满危险...
For the world has grown full of peril...

1544
02:36:06,730 --> 02:36:09,390
在所有的土地上...
...and in all lands...

1545
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:13,050
爱都混合了悲伤
...Iove is now mingled with grief.

1546
02:36:25,740 --> 02:36:28,440
现在魔戒远征队会怎么样？
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1547
02:36:29,010 --> 02:36:32,010
没有了甘道夫 希望也失去了
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1548
02:36:34,950 --> 02:36:38,250
这趟旅程险象环生
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

1549
02:36:38,390 --> 02:36:41,480
只要一不小心你们就会失败...
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1550
02:36:42,260 --> 02:36:45,060
世界末日也会降临
...to the ruin of all.

1551
02:36:49,430 --> 02:36:55,270
只要你们团结一致就有希望
Yet hope remains while the Company is true.

1552
02:36:56,810 --> 02:37:01,580
不要让你们的内心烦扰 快去休息吧...
Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest...

1553
02:37:01,980 --> 02:37:05,640
你们有太多的哀伤和疲惫
...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.

1554
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:10,050
今晚你们要好好睡一觉
Tonight, you will sleep....

1555
02:37:10,290 --> 02:37:13,730
欢迎 夏尔的佛罗多...
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1556
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:16,960
只有你见过邪眼！
...one who has seen the Eye!

1557
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:26,360
欧络因(甘道夫)曾被西方众神派来守护东方的土地
A Olórin i yaresse Mentaner i Numeherui Tírien i Rómenóri

1558
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:31,640
我们对这片土地的爱比深海还深
Melme nóren sina núra ala E?ro

1559
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:34,200
悼念甘道夫的挽歌
A lament for Gandalf.

1560
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:41,460
最贤明的迈雅 是什么让你离开了你热爱的土地
Maiaron i Oiosaila, Manan elye etevanne Nórie i malanelye?

1561
02:37:41,490 --> 02:37:43,010
他们说些什么？
What do they say about him?

1562
02:37:43,320 --> 02:37:45,920
我不忍心告诉你们
I have not the heart to tell you.

1563
02:37:48,860 --> 02:37:51,060
因为我的伤痛还未平息
For me, the grief is still too near.

1564
02:37:51,160 --> 02:37:53,870
我们宁愿抛弃一切选择屈服来挽留你
Ilfirin nairelma ullume nucuvalme. Nauva i nauva.

1565
02:37:54,070 --> 02:37:56,900
我打赌他们没有提到他放的烟火
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1566
02:37:57,070 --> 02:38:00,100
他们应该作诗来歌颂这一点
There should be a verse about them.

1567
02:38:03,580 --> 02:38:05,570
从古到今最棒的烟火
The finest rockets ever seen

1568
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:09,510
在空中闪烁就像耀眼的星斗
They burst in stars of blue and green

1569
02:38:10,450 --> 02:38:11,650
这些闪闪发光的烟火
Or after thunder,

1570
02:38:12,750 --> 02:38:15,650
就像银河一样从天而降
silver showers

1571
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:19,150
就跟天空飘下的花雨一样缤纷
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1572
02:38:19,290 --> 02:38:23,190
这都不足以形容它们有多壮观
Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.

1573
02:38:34,010 --> 02:38:36,700
快休息吧
Take some rest.

1574
02:38:36,910 --> 02:38:39,570
这里很安全
These borders are well-protected.

1575
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:42,300
我在这里无法休息
I will find no rest here.

1576
02:38:45,150 --> 02:38:48,140
我在头脑里听到她的声音
I heard her voice inside my head.

1577
02:38:48,490 --> 02:38:52,120
她提到我父亲和刚铎的灭亡
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.

1578
02:38:52,290 --> 02:38:57,750
她对我说 即使现在仍有一线希望
She said to me, "Even now there is hope left."

1579
02:38:59,160 --> 02:39:02,000
但是我却看不到
But I cannot see it.

1580
02:39:03,340 --> 02:39:05,800
很久以来我们都没有希望
It is long since we had any hope.

1581
02:39:16,010 --> 02:39:18,140
我父亲是个高贵的人
My father is a noble man.

1582
02:39:18,950 --> 02:39:21,150
但是他的统治正在衰败...
But his rule is failing...

1583
02:39:24,260 --> 02:39:26,850
我们的子民也失去信心
...and our people lose faith.

1584
02:39:28,290 --> 02:39:31,820
他指望我能成功 我也想
He looks to me to make things right, and I would do it.

1585
02:39:32,030 --> 02:39:35,520
我想看到刚铎的荣耀恢复
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

1586
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:41,400
你以前见过吗 阿拉贡？
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1587
02:39:42,040 --> 02:39:44,070
爱克西里昂的白塔
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1588
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:48,080
就像一串珍珠一样微微发光
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.

1589
02:39:48,780 --> 02:39:52,510
塔上的旗帜随早晨的微风高高飘扬
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.

1590
02:39:55,150 --> 02:39:57,140
你以前有没有...
Have you ever been called home...

1591
02:39:57,290 --> 02:40:01,190
被清晰的银号角声召唤回家？
...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

1592
02:40:01,860 --> 02:40:05,060
我见过那个白色城市...
I have seen the White City...

1593
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:06,900
很久以前
...Iong ago.

1594
02:40:07,900 --> 02:40:12,840
有一天 我们将一起去那儿
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1595
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:16,740
到时候塔上守卫将高喊
And the tower guard shall take up the call:

1596
02:40:17,210 --> 02:40:20,540
刚铎之王回来了
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1597
02:41:27,720 --> 02:41:29,930
你能看看镜子吗？
Will you look into the mirror?

1598
02:41:30,440 --> 02:41:31,880
我会看到什么？
What will I see?

1599
02:41:34,940 --> 02:41:37,390
就连最聪明的智者也不知道
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1600
02:41:38,210 --> 02:41:39,800
因为镜子...
For the mirror...

1601
02:41:40,220 --> 02:41:42,840
能显现很多事情
...shows many things.

1602
02:41:45,870 --> 02:41:48,190
过去的事情...
Things that were...

1603
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:50,920
现在的事情...
...things that are...

1604
02:41:51,820 --> 02:41:53,770
还有一些事情...
...and some things...

1605
02:41:57,310 --> 02:42:00,870
尚未发生
...that have not yet come to pass.

1606
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:26,080
我知道你看到什么
I knowwhat it is you saw.

1607
02:43:27,870 --> 02:43:31,570
因为它一样也在我心里呈现
For it is also in my mind.

1608
02:43:32,140 --> 02:43:36,770
如果你失败就会发生这些事
It is what will come to pass if you should fail.

1609
02:43:38,580 --> 02:43:44,090
远征队已经开始四分五裂
The Fellowship is breaking. It is already begun.

1610
02:43:44,090 --> 02:43:47,590
他会试图抢走魔戒
He will try to take the Ring.

1611
02:43:47,590 --> 02:43:50,590
你知道我说的是谁
You know of whom I speak.

1612
02:43:50,590 --> 02:43:55,840
他们会一个接一个被魔戒击垮
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1613
02:43:56,770 --> 02:43:59,600
只要你开口...
If you ask it of me...

1614
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:03,430
我就把至尊魔戒给你
... I will give you the One Ring.

1615
02:44:03,710 --> 02:44:06,970
你肯毫无条件地给我
You offer it to me freely.

1616
02:44:10,480 --> 02:44:15,380
我承认我很渴望魔戒
I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.

1617
02:44:20,790 --> 02:44:24,530
我将成为魔戒之后
In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen...

1618
02:44:24,530 --> 02:44:28,970
她并不黑暗而是美丽得跟曙光一样耀眼！
...not dark but beautiful, and terrible as the dawn!

1619
02:44:28,970 --> 02:44:32,500
跟海洋一样高深莫测！
Treacherous as the sea!

1620
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:37,880
远比土地更加坚强！
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!

1621
02:44:37,880 --> 02:44:40,480
世人都将迷恋我...
All shall love me...

1622
02:44:40,480 --> 02:44:43,840
而且自暴自弃
...and despair.

1623
02:44:57,390 --> 02:45:00,910
我通过了考验
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1624
02:45:00,910 --> 02:45:04,900
我将退隐到西方...
...and go into the West...

1625
02:45:05,100 --> 02:45:08,110
继续当凯兰崔尔女王
...and remain Galadriel. 

1626
02:45:08,110 --> 02:45:11,110
我一个人无法摧毁它
I cannot do this alone.

1627
02:45:12,740 --> 02:45:17,780
你是魔戒持有者 佛罗多 持有至尊魔戒...
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of Power...

1628
02:45:17,780 --> 02:45:19,950
注定孤单一人
...is to be alone.

1629
02:45:23,110 --> 02:45:25,690
这是南雅 钻石之戒
This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant.

1630
02:45:25,690 --> 02:45:28,280
我是它的守护者
And I am its keeper.

1631
02:45:30,490 --> 02:45:35,150
这个任务指派给你
This task was appointed to you.

1632
02:45:35,170 --> 02:45:38,770
如果你办不到...
And if you do not find a way...

1633
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:41,640
没有人可以
...no one will.

1634
02:45:41,640 --> 02:45:45,250
我知道该怎么做了
Then I know what I must do.

1635
02:45:45,480 --> 02:45:47,330
只是...
It's just...

1636
02:45:49,910 --> 02:45:52,950
我感到害怕
...I'm afraid to do it.

1637
02:45:55,690 --> 02:46:01,320
即使再渺小的人也能改变未来
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.

1638
02:46:07,100 --> 02:46:12,740
你知道半兽人是怎么来的吗？
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?

1639
02:46:13,500 --> 02:46:17,700
它们曾经是精灵
They were Elves once.

1640
02:46:17,930 --> 02:46:21,500
但是却被黑暗力量...
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1641
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:24,950
折磨到不成人形
...tortured and mutilated.

1642
02:46:24,950 --> 02:46:30,330
它们是被扭曲的可怕生物
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1643
02:46:30,330 --> 02:46:33,350
而现在...
And now...

1644
02:46:33,580 --> 02:46:36,140
变得完美
...perfected.

1645
02:46:36,140 --> 02:46:40,560
我的强兽人战士...
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1646
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:44,010
你的主人是谁？
...whom do you serve?

1647
02:46:44,010 --> 02:46:47,490
萨鲁曼！
Saruman!

1648
02:47:06,620 --> 02:47:10,630
猎杀他们 找不到绝不罢手
Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found.

1649
02:47:10,630 --> 02:47:13,560
你们没有痛苦 你们没有恐惧
You do not know pain. You do not know fear.

1650
02:47:13,560 --> 02:47:18,100
你们只会杀人！
You will taste Man-flesh!

1651
02:47:21,670 --> 02:47:25,440
有一个半身人手中有宝物
One of the halflings carries something of great value.

1652
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:31,210
我要你毫发无伤地活抓他们
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1653
02:47:31,650 --> 02:47:34,310
杀了其他人
Kill the others.

1654
02:47:51,740 --> 02:47:58,240
我们从来没有让外人穿上我们精灵的装束
Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.

1655
02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:03,810
希望这些精灵斗篷能让你们躲过敌人的侦察
May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes.

1656
02:48:09,450 --> 02:48:11,520
兰巴斯
Lembas.

1657
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:14,480
精灵的干粮
Elvish waybread.

1658
02:48:15,630 --> 02:48:19,980
只要咬一小口就能让一个成年人填饱肚子
One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man.

1659
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,340
你吃了几块？
How many did you eat?

1660
02:48:27,340 --> 02:48:30,270
四块
Four.

1661
02:48:34,680 --> 02:48:37,480
你们每向南方走一步就离危险更近一步
Every league you travel south, the danger will increase.

1662
02:48:37,480 --> 02:48:41,790
魔多的半兽人占领了安都因河东岸
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin.

1663
02:48:41,790 --> 02:48:44,290
但是西岸也并不安全
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

1664
02:48:44,290 --> 02:48:48,490
奇怪的白掌部队曾经出没在我们的边界
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand have been seen on our borders.

1665
02:48:48,490 --> 02:48:54,960
半兽人不能在太阳下行动 但是这些怪物却可以
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so.

1666
02:49:01,970 --> 02:49:05,200
他们在追杀你们
You are being tracked.

1667
02:49:05,980 --> 02:49:12,240
只有走水路才有可能赶在敌人前到达拉洛斯瀑布
By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.

1668
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:33,070
我送你的礼物 勒苟拉斯 是凯兰崔姆弓箭
My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1669
02:49:33,070 --> 02:49:38,030
能让你拥有百步穿杨的绝技
Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.

1670
02:49:41,950 --> 02:49:44,580
这些是诺多伦短剑
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1671
02:49:44,580 --> 02:49:48,650
曾经在战场上杀敌无数
They have already seen service in war.

1672
02:49:48,650 --> 02:49:51,220
千万别害怕 小皮里格林・图克
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1673
02:49:51,220 --> 02:49:55,990
你会找到你的勇气
You will find your courage.

1674
02:49:56,390 --> 02:49:58,560
送给你的 山姆卫斯・詹吉
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

1675
02:49:58,560 --> 02:50:01,430
希斯蓝制作的精灵之绳
...Elven rope made of hithlain.

1676
02:50:01,430 --> 02:50:05,030
谢谢你 女王
Thank you, my lady.

1677
02:50:05,400 --> 02:50:10,200
那些漂亮的短剑没有了吗？
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

1678
02:50:15,150 --> 02:50:18,450
那么矮人向精灵要什么礼物？
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the Elves?

1679
02:50:18,450 --> 02:50:21,120
什么都不要
Nothing.

1680
02:50:21,120 --> 02:50:25,090
我再看凯兰崔尔女王最后一眼就足够了
Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time...

1681
02:50:25,090 --> 02:50:31,750
因为她比地底蕴藏的所有珠宝都美丽
...for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1682
02:50:37,340 --> 02:50:38,930
实际上...
Actually...

1683
02:50:39,100 --> 02:50:41,440
我是有一个要求
There was one thing.

1684
02:50:41,440 --> 02:50:44,380
不 不 我不能 那太不可能了
No, no, I couldn't. It's quite impossible.

1685
02:50:44,380 --> 02:50:48,640
说出来太傻了
Stupid to ask.

1686
02:50:49,850 --> 02:50:52,120
我不能再给你什么
I have nothing greater to give...

1687
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:56,420
因为你已拥有最珍贵的礼物
...than the gift you already bear.

1688
02:50:56,420 --> 02:50:58,250
那就是亚玟的爱
Am meleth d?n.

1689
02:50:58,860 --> 02:51:05,110
我怕亚玟・安多米尔的光芒会黯淡
I ant e-guil Arwen Undómiel…pelitha.

1690
02:51:05,210 --> 02:51:09,730
所以我要让她离开中土世界
Aníron i e broniatha,

1691
02:51:09,730 --> 02:51:13,440
跟她的族人在一起
ad ae periatham athar i methid en-amar hen.

1692
02:51:14,640 --> 02:51:21,050
我会让她坐船到瓦林诺
Aníron i e círatha na Valannor.

1693
02:51:21,050 --> 02:51:24,850
她必须面对这个抉择
That choice is yet before her.

1694
02:51:24,850 --> 02:51:28,050
你也必须做出决定 阿拉贡
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

1695
02:51:28,050 --> 02:51:34,360
重建自伊兰迪尔以来你的先祖创造的辉煌成就
To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1696
02:51:34,360 --> 02:51:39,360
或是带着你仅存的子民坠入绝望的黑暗深渊
...or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin.

1697
02:51:45,370 --> 02:51:47,470
永别了
Namárie.

1698
02:51:50,340 --> 02:51:54,600
还有很多你要做的事情
Nadath na i moe cerich.

1699
02:52:00,320 --> 02:52:01,820
我们将不会再见面...
Dan ú-'eveditham

1700
02:52:01,990 --> 02:52:03,410
伊力萨
Elessar.

1701
02:52:05,890 --> 02:52:09,260
再会了 佛罗多・巴金斯
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1702
02:52:09,260 --> 02:52:13,230
我送给你埃兰迪尔之光...
I give you the light of E?rendil...

1703
02:52:13,230 --> 02:52:16,930
我们最挚爱的星辰
...our most beloved star.

1704
02:52:25,210 --> 02:52:29,810
愿它在所有光亮熄灭时...
May it be a light for you in dark places...

1705
02:52:29,810 --> 02:52:34,810
在黑暗中为你带来光明
... when all other lights go out.

1706
02:52:42,730 --> 02:52:46,430
这次离别带给我的伤痛最深...
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...

1707
02:52:46,430 --> 02:52:51,370
因为这是我最后一次看到最美丽的女王
...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

1708
02:52:51,370 --> 02:52:55,540
以后我不会说什么东西美丽除了她的礼物
Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me.

1709
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:57,470
她送你什么礼物？
What was her gift?

1710
02:52:57,470 --> 02:53:03,030
我向她要一根她头上的金发
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

1711
02:53:03,030 --> 02:53:06,850
她给了我三根
She gave me three.

1712
02:54:47,950 --> 02:54:52,450
咕噜 他从摩瑞亚矿坑一直在跟踪我们
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1713
02:54:54,930 --> 02:54:58,050
我以为在河上就能甩掉他
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

1714
02:54:58,260 --> 02:55:02,210
可是他的水性很好
But he's too clever a waterman.

1715
02:55:02,470 --> 02:55:05,830
如果他把我们的行踪告诉敌人
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

1716
02:55:05,940 --> 02:55:08,330
我们想要渡河就会更危险
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

1717
02:55:08,370 --> 02:55:10,610
吃点东西吧 佛罗多先生
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1718
02:55:10,610 --> 02:55:11,920
不要 山姆
No, Sam. 

1719
02:55:11,920 --> 02:55:13,880
你一整天都没吃过东西
You haven't eaten anything all day.

1720
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:17,920
你也睡得很不安稳 别以为我没注意到
You're not sleeping, neither. Don't think I haven't noticed.

1721
02:55:17,920 --> 02:55:19,110
佛罗多先生...
Mr. Frodo... 

1722
02:55:19,620 --> 02:55:21,320
我很好
I'm all right.

1723
02:55:21,320 --> 02:55:22,920
你并不好
But you're not.

1724
02:55:22,920 --> 02:55:25,490
我是来帮你的
I'm here to help you.

1725
02:55:25,490 --> 02:55:28,050
我答应甘道夫我会的
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1726
02:55:33,060 --> 02:55:36,760
你帮不了我 山姆
You can't help me, Sam.

1727
02:55:38,030 --> 02:55:40,660
这次不行
Not this time.

1728
02:55:42,670 --> 02:55:45,670
去睡吧
Get some sleep.

1729
02:55:50,810 --> 02:55:53,730
到米那斯提力斯比较安全
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1730
02:55:53,730 --> 02:55:57,380
我们可以在那里养精蓄锐
You know that. From there we can regroup.

1731
02:55:57,390 --> 02:55:59,890
然后一鼓作气攻向魔多
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

1732
02:55:59,890 --> 02:56:03,290
刚铎也帮不了我们
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

1733
02:56:03,290 --> 02:56:05,880
你倒是很愿意相信精灵
You were quick enough to trust the Elves.

1734
02:56:06,900 --> 02:56:09,900
你对自己的子民一点信心都没有吗？
Have you so little faith in your own people?

1735
02:56:09,900 --> 02:56:13,420
对 他们是很软弱 他们意志薄弱
Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty.

1736
02:56:13,420 --> 02:56:16,540
但是人类之中也有勇气和荣誉
But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men.

1737
02:56:16,540 --> 02:56:19,230
可是你都看不到
But you will not see that.

1738
02:56:19,230 --> 02:56:20,730
你很害怕！
You are afraid!

1739
02:56:20,730 --> 02:56:23,480
你这辈子都躲在阴影下
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

1740
02:56:23,480 --> 02:56:28,000
不敢承认你自己的身份
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

1741
02:56:29,150 --> 02:56:34,790
我不会把魔戒带到你的城市
I will not lead the Ring within a hundred leagues of your city.

1742
02:56:45,590 --> 02:56:47,970
佛罗多
Frodo.

1743
02:56:48,910 --> 02:56:51,330
亚苟那斯巨像
The Argonath.

1744
02:56:53,640 --> 02:56:58,120
我一直都想仰望的老国王
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.

1745
02:56:58,120 --> 02:57:01,180
我的先祖
My kin.

1746
02:58:19,060 --> 02:58:21,500
天一黑我们就渡湖
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1747
02:58:21,500 --> 02:58:24,370
把船藏好再步行
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1748
02:58:24,370 --> 02:58:26,530
我们从北边进入魔多
We approach Mordor from the North. 

1749
02:58:26,530 --> 02:58:27,870
是吗？
Oh, yes?

1750
02:58:27,870 --> 02:58:32,150
只要通过爱明莫尔就行了...
Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil...

1751
02:58:32,150 --> 02:58:35,750
那是充满尖石的迷宫
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

1752
02:58:35,750 --> 02:58:39,350
然后呢 就更好走了
And after that, it gets even better.

1753
02:58:39,350 --> 02:58:44,620
那儿有一望无际的臭沼泽地
Festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see.

1754
02:58:44,620 --> 02:58:46,720
那就是我们的路
That is our road.

1755
02:58:47,290 --> 02:58:50,790
我建议你休息一下养精蓄锐 矮人大师
I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1756
02:58:50,790 --> 02:58:53,390
养精蓄锐个头
Recover my--

1757
02:58:55,330 --> 02:58:56,830
我们应该马上走
We should leave now. 

1758
02:58:56,830 --> 02:58:57,460
不行
No.

1759
02:58:57,600 --> 02:59:02,340
半兽人在巡逻东岸 我们一定要等到天黑再出发
Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.

1760
02:59:02,340 --> 02:59:05,810
我担心的不是东岸
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

1761
02:59:05,810 --> 02:59:10,310
我心中一直有一个阴影和威胁
A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind.

1762
02:59:10,310 --> 02:59:15,580
有什么正在接近 我感觉得到
Something draws near. I can feel it.

1763
02:59:16,490 --> 02:59:21,830
养精蓄锐？别理他 小哈比人
Recover strength? Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1764
02:59:21,830 --> 02:59:24,720
佛罗多呢？
Where's Frodo?

1765
02:59:49,190 --> 02:59:52,290
我们都不该一个人乱跑
None of us should wander alone.

1766
02:59:52,590 --> 02:59:54,960
尤其是你
You, least of all.

1767
02:59:54,960 --> 02:59:58,430
你的责任重大
So much depends on you.

1768
02:59:58,430 --> 03:00:01,460
佛罗多？
Frodo?

1769
03:00:07,270 --> 03:00:10,770
我知道你为什么想独自待着
I know why you seek solitude.

1770
03:00:10,770 --> 03:00:14,980
我每天都看着你受苦
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1771
03:00:14,980 --> 03:00:19,140
你确定你不是白白受苦吗？
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1772
03:00:19,820 --> 03:00:22,590
还有其它的路 佛罗多
There are other ways, Frodo.

1773
03:00:22,590 --> 03:00:24,290
我们可以走另一条路
Other paths that we might take. 

1774
03:00:24,290 --> 03:00:26,620
我知道你想说什么
I know what you would say.

1775
03:00:26,620 --> 03:00:30,530
好像很有道理 但我得到警告
It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart.

1776
03:00:30,530 --> 03:00:34,000
警告？警告什么？
Warning? Against what?

1777
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,320
我们都很害怕 佛罗多
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1778
03:00:36,320 --> 03:00:40,110
但如果让恐惧摧毁一切希望...
But to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have...

1779
03:00:40,110 --> 03:00:42,730
未免太不值得了吧？
...don't you see that is madness? 

1780
03:00:42,730 --> 03:00:44,700
没有别的路可走
There is no other way.

1781
03:00:45,740 --> 03:00:50,040
我只想得到捍卫我的子民的力量！
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

1782
03:00:50,630 --> 03:00:52,230
只要你把魔戒借给我
lf you would but lend me the Ring. 

1783
03:00:52,230 --> 03:00:53,650
不行
No.

1784
03:00:53,650 --> 03:00:56,050
为什么你要退缩？我又不是强盗
Why do you recoil? I am no thief. 

1785
03:00:56,050 --> 03:00:58,310
你失去了理智
You are not yourself.

1786
03:00:59,520 --> 03:01:02,860
你以为你有什么机会？
What chance do you think you have?

1787
03:01:02,860 --> 03:01:07,760
他们会找到你 他们会抢走魔戒
They will find you. They will take the Ring.

1788
03:01:07,760 --> 03:01:12,530
然后你会求生不能 求死不得！
And you will beg for death before the end!

1789
03:01:13,600 --> 03:01:15,870
你这傻瓜！
You fool!

1790
03:01:15,870 --> 03:01:19,890
你只是靠运气得到它！它应该是我的
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance! It could have been mine.

1791
03:01:19,890 --> 03:01:22,900
它应该是我的！把它给我！
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1792
03:01:22,900 --> 03:01:23,640
把它给我！
Give it to me!

1793
03:01:23,700 --> 03:01:24,240
不！
No!

1794
03:01:24,560 --> 03:01:25,350
把它给我！
Give it to me!

1795
03:01:25,400 --> 03:01:26,850
不！
No.

1796
03:01:33,890 --> 03:01:36,360
我知道了
I see your mind.

1797
03:01:36,360 --> 03:01:39,500
你会把魔戒交给索伦！
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1798
03:01:39,500 --> 03:01:41,800
你会背叛我们！
You will betray us!

1799
03:01:41,800 --> 03:01:45,240
你会害我们跟你一起死！
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

1800
03:01:45,240 --> 03:01:49,860
诅咒你！诅咒你和所有的半身人！
Curse you! Curse you and all the halflings!

1801
03:01:55,750 --> 03:01:58,440
佛罗多？
Frodo?

1802
03:02:01,630 --> 03:02:04,340
佛罗多
Frodo.

1803
03:02:07,290 --> 03:02:09,360
我做了什么？
What have I done?

1804
03:02:09,360 --> 03:02:11,260
求求你 佛罗多
Please, Frodo.

1805
03:02:11,260 --> 03:02:15,090
佛罗多 对不起！
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1806
03:03:02,510 --> 03:03:05,110
佛罗多？
Frodo?

1807
03:03:05,280 --> 03:03:07,330
它蛊惑了波罗莫
It has taken Boromir. 

1808
03:03:07,330 --> 03:03:08,690
魔戒呢？
Where is the Ring?

1809
03:03:08,690 --> 03:03:10,890
别过来！
Stay away!

1810
03:03:10,890 --> 03:03:13,450
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1811
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:17,010
我发誓要保护你
I swore to protect you. 

1812
03:03:17,010 --> 03:03:19,730
你能保证你不会害我吗？
Can you protect me from yourself?

1813
03:03:28,260 --> 03:03:31,700
你会摧毁它吗？
Would you destroy it?

1814
03:03:35,610 --> 03:03:38,650
阿拉贡
Aragorn.

1815
03:03:40,880 --> 03:03:44,380
阿拉贡
Aragorn.

1816
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:48,050
伊力萨
Elessar.

1817
03:03:54,830 --> 03:03:58,770
我愿意跟随你到最后
I would have gone with you to the end.

1818
03:03:58,770 --> 03:04:02,570
跟随到魔多烈焰
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1819
03:04:04,780 --> 03:04:07,070
我知道了
I know.

1820
03:04:08,480 --> 03:04:15,010
好好照顾他们 尤其是山姆 他不会理解
Look after the others. Especially Sam. He will not understand.

1821
03:04:17,690 --> 03:04:20,480
快走 佛罗多！
Go, Frodo!

1822
03:04:22,130 --> 03:04:24,360
快跑
Run.

1823
03:04:24,360 --> 03:04:26,890
快跑！
Run!

1824
03:04:50,290 --> 03:04:53,110
佛罗多先生！
Mr. Frodo!

1825
03:05:01,330 --> 03:05:04,160
找到半身人！
Find the halfling!

1826
03:05:04,780 --> 03:05:08,330
找到半身人！
Find the halfling!

1827
03:05:10,620 --> 03:05:13,470
伊兰迪尔！
Elendil!

1828
03:05:18,820 --> 03:05:21,540
阿拉贡 快走！
Aragorn, go!

1829
03:05:42,110 --> 03:05:44,070
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1830
03:05:44,070 --> 03:05:46,310
躲过来 快！
Hide here. Quick!

1831
03:05:46,310 --> 03:05:48,840
快啊！
Come on!

1832
03:05:50,250 --> 03:05:53,340
他在干嘛？
What's he doing?

1833
03:05:56,430 --> 03:05:59,580
他要走了
He's leaving.

1834
03:06:03,190 --> 03:06:04,690
不！
No! 

1835
03:06:04,690 --> 03:06:06,730
皮聘！
Pippin!

1836
03:06:11,080 --> 03:06:13,590
跑 佛罗多 快跑！
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1837
03:06:13,890 --> 03:06:16,740
嘿！嘿 你！我在这里！
Hey! Hey, you! Over here!

1838
03:06:16,740 --> 03:06:17,740
嘿！
Hey!

1839
03:06:17,740 --> 03:06:18,230
我在这里！
Over here!

1840
03:06:18,340 --> 03:06:19,930
这里啊！
This way!

1841
03:06:30,030 --> 03:06:30,640
成功了！
It's working!

1842
03:06:30,730 --> 03:06:33,240
我知道啦！快跑！
I know it's working! Run!

1843
03:07:27,860 --> 03:07:29,760
刚铎的号角
The horn of Gondor. 

1844
03:07:29,760 --> 03:07:31,730
波罗莫
Boromir.

1845
03:08:13,760 --> 03:08:16,020
跑！快跑！
Run!

1846
03:11:46,370 --> 03:11:49,230
不
No.

1847
03:11:52,010 --> 03:11:53,610
他们把小个子抓走了
They took the little ones. 

1848
03:11:53,610 --> 03:11:55,410
别动
Hold still.

1849
03:11:55,410 --> 03:11:58,500
佛罗多 佛罗多在哪里？
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1850
03:11:59,420 --> 03:12:01,350
我让佛罗多走了
I let Frodo go.

1851
03:12:01,350 --> 03:12:04,990
你做到我做不到的事
Then you did what I could not.

1852
03:12:04,990 --> 03:12:08,830
我试图抢走魔戒
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1853
03:12:08,830 --> 03:12:11,530
现在谁也抢不走魔戒了
The Ring is beyond our reach now. 

1854
03:12:11,530 --> 03:12:13,400
原谅我
Forgive me.

1855
03:12:13,400 --> 03:12:15,800
我没有想到
I did not see it.

1856
03:12:15,800 --> 03:12:17,800
我让大家失望了
I have failed you all. 

1857
03:12:17,800 --> 03:12:19,680
不 波罗莫
No, Boromir.

1858
03:12:19,730 --> 03:12:22,340
你很英勇
You fought bravely.

1859
03:12:22,340 --> 03:12:25,480
你维护了你的荣誉
You have kept your honor.

1860
03:12:25,480 --> 03:12:27,720
算了
Leave it.

1861
03:12:27,720 --> 03:12:31,000
都结束了
It is over.

1862
03:12:31,050 --> 03:12:36,720
人类世界将灭亡 黑暗将笼罩大地...
The world of Men will fall. And all will come to darkness...

1863
03:12:36,720 --> 03:12:40,880
我的城市将遭毁灭
...and my city to ruin.

1864
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:47,030
我不知道我有多少力量...
I do not know what strength is in my blood...

1865
03:12:47,030 --> 03:12:51,700
但我发誓绝不会让白城沦陷...
...but I swear to you, I will not let the White City fall...

1866
03:12:51,700 --> 03:12:55,360
也不会让我们的子民失败
...nor our people fail.

1867
03:12:55,390 --> 03:12:57,700
我们的子民
Our people.

1868
03:13:00,380 --> 03:13:03,600
我们的子民
Our people.

1869
03:13:24,130 --> 03:13:28,390
我愿跟随你 我的兄弟
I would have followed you, my brother.

1870
03:13:28,670 --> 03:13:31,930
我的领袖
My captain.

1871
03:13:33,310 --> 03:13:36,480
我的国王
My king.

1872
03:13:54,830 --> 03:13:57,500
安息吧...
Be at peace...

1873
03:13:57,500 --> 03:14:00,760
刚铎之子
...son of Gondor.

1874
03:14:15,950 --> 03:14:19,820
他们在白塔等待他的归来
They will look for his coming from the White Tower.

1875
03:14:19,820 --> 03:14:24,080
但是他永远不会回去了
But he will not return.

1876
03:14:46,050 --> 03:14:49,310
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1877
03:15:07,470 --> 03:15:12,010
我真希望魔戒没在我手中
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1878
03:15:12,010 --> 03:15:16,270
真希望这一切都没发生
I wish none of this had happened.

1879
03:15:17,980 --> 03:15:20,950
每个人遇到难关都会这么想...
So do all who live to see such times...

1880
03:15:20,950 --> 03:15:24,620
但是那不由我们决定
...but that is not for them to decide.

1881
03:15:24,620 --> 03:15:27,460
我们所能决定的是...
All you have to decide...

1882
03:15:27,460 --> 03:15:33,460
在给予我们的时间内去做什么
...is what to do with the time that is given to you.

1883
03:16:01,020 --> 03:16:03,630
佛罗多 不要走！
Frodo, no!

1884
03:16:03,630 --> 03:16:05,700
佛罗多！
Frodo!

1885
03:16:05,700 --> 03:16:07,210
佛罗多先生！
Mr. Frodo! 

1886
03:16:07,210 --> 03:16:09,090
不 山姆
No, Sam.

1887
03:16:11,970 --> 03:16:14,440
回去吧 山姆！
Go back, Sam!

1888
03:16:14,440 --> 03:16:16,740
我要独自去魔多
I'm going to Mordor alone.

1889
03:16:16,740 --> 03:16:18,210
你当然要去
Of course you are.

1890
03:16:18,210 --> 03:16:21,540
但我要跟你一起去！
And I'm coming with you!

1891
03:16:21,540 --> 03:16:25,240
你不会游泳！
You can't swim!

1892
03:16:27,750 --> 03:16:30,750
山姆！
Sam!

1893
03:16:35,020 --> 03:16:37,660
山姆！
Sam!

1894
03:17:17,270 --> 03:17:20,370
我许下一个承诺 佛罗多先生
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1895
03:17:20,370 --> 03:17:25,810
一个承诺 千万别离开他 山姆卫斯・詹吉
A promise: "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1896
03:17:25,810 --> 03:17:28,710
我绝不会离开你
And I don't mean to.

1897
03:17:28,710 --> 03:17:32,140
绝对不会
I don't mean to.

1898
03:17:32,550 --> 03:17:35,650
山姆
Sam.

1899
03:17:49,230 --> 03:17:52,190
来吧
Come on.

1900
03:18:19,330 --> 03:18:25,190
快！佛罗多和山姆就快到东岸了
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.

1901
03:18:38,810 --> 03:18:40,810
你不想跟着他们
You mean not to follow them. 

1902
03:18:40,810 --> 03:18:44,510
佛罗多的命运已经不由我们掌握
Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1903
03:18:47,220 --> 03:18:53,390
一切都是徒劳 远征队失败了
Then it has all been in vain. The Fellowship has failed.

1904
03:19:03,870 --> 03:19:08,400
只要我们彼此真诚就不是徒劳
Not if we hold true to each other.

1905
03:19:08,510 --> 03:19:13,980
我们不会丢下梅里和皮聘让他们受苦而死
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death.

1906
03:19:13,980 --> 03:19:16,280
只要我们还有力气
Not while we have strength left.

1907
03:19:16,280 --> 03:19:19,220
把用不着的东西留下来
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1908
03:19:20,520 --> 03:19:22,690
我们轻装而行
We travel light.

1909
03:19:22,690 --> 03:19:25,930
让我们猎杀半兽人吧
Let us hunt some Orc.

1910
03:19:27,600 --> 03:19:30,920
好！
Yes!

1911
03:19:48,650 --> 03:19:50,720
魔多
Mordor.

1912
03:19:50,720 --> 03:19:55,020
希望其他人走的路比较安全
I hope the others find a safer road.

1913
03:19:55,020 --> 03:19:58,490
神行客会照顾他们的
Strider will look after them.

1914
03:19:58,490 --> 03:20:02,200
我想我们不会再见到他们了
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

1915
03:20:02,200 --> 03:20:04,870
也许还会 佛罗多先生
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1916
03:20:04,870 --> 03:20:07,690
也许会
We may.

1917
03:20:08,470 --> 03:20:10,830
山姆...
Sam...

1918
03:20:13,180 --> 03:20:17,040
我很高兴你和我一起
...I'm glad you are with me.
