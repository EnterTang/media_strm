The Essex ran aground, there was a full inquiry.

44
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,796
我觉得那份报告不是事实全部
I believe the inquiry was less than truthful.

45
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:18,996
滚出去
Get out.

00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:23,676

你没听见我的话吗 出去

我一点都不了解他
I don't know anything about him.

54

他的精神在受折磨 需要救赎

你酗酒要死的时候谁撑着这个家了
Who holds this place together while you drink yourself to death?

61
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,196
你必须和这个年轻人谈

62
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,436
才能保住你的钱

71
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:30,536
销量很好 但我估计这个故事
They had good sales, but I think that THIS story

72
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:34,876
甚至能超过我销量不错的第一部小说
could surpass even the success of my first novel... which did quite well.

73
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:38,816
又一个你的航海轶事
Another of your seafaring yarns.

你听说过霍索恩吗 梅尔维尔先生

当下有一名作家 一个大作家
Now, there's a writer, a great writer.

他是的
He is.

77
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:57,266
但他不在这儿 因为我自己的原因
But he is not here, and I am...

78
00:06:57,466 --> 00:07:00,096
我在这儿

我会告诉你埃塞克斯号 我相信你会失望的
I'll tell you of the Essex, I believe you will be disappointed,

80

但我说的每个字都是真实的
but every word I say will be true.

81
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:21,546
埃塞克斯号的故事就是两个男人的故事

欧文 你不能迟到
Owen, you don't want to be late.

85

我会到那儿的 再说了 不能让我们的女儿睡在破陋的房子里对吧
I'll be there, besides, can't have our daughter sleeping under a leaky roof, can we?

86
00:07:38,606 --> 00:07:40,706
你为什么那么肯定是女儿
What makes you so sure it's a girl?

87

肯定是的 她会提醒我你这么固执为什么我还是爱你
Well, it has to be, so she can remind me why I have to love you, and you being stubborn.

00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:48,826
如果是女儿她会更像你而不是我
If it's to to be a daughter she'll be a version of you, not me.

I suppose after today you'll be tradin' in that tunic for a uniform.

那个承诺要推迟了

00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:17,896
我理解你的失落
I understand your disappointment.

134
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:18,946
所以
So...

135
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:22,086
115金币
A one-fifteenth lay.

136
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:26,926
我从来没有给新长官支付过这么多
And that's more than I've ever paid any first officer.

137
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:31,666
如果你带回来2000桶油 我向你保证
And if you bring back 2000 barrels of oil, I'll give you my word,

138
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:35,386
<i>下次你就会是船长
<i>next time you WILL have your captaincy.

139
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:38,446
你之前给过我保证来 马森先生
You've given me your word before, Mr. Mason.

140
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:43,036
这次我需要书面保证
So, this time I'll take it in writing.

141
00:11:56,006 --> 00:12:01,516
波拉德船长 我们和查斯先生达成了协议
Captain Pollard, we've just had a most agreeable conversation with Mr. Chase,

142
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:03,746
他会很荣幸服务于您
who'd be honored to serve under you.

143
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:07,346
我很高兴听到
I'm glad to hear it.

144
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:09,876
现在我得照顾个没经验的
Now I'm to babysit a greenhorn.

145
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:14,226
一个含着他妈的金勺长大的船长了
Some cheerless Nantucket born with a damned silver spoon in his mouth.

146
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:16,076
我真应该当面拒绝
I should have thrown their offer back in their faces.

147
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:20,046
为什么 你已经拿到书面承诺了
Why? You now have the offer of command in writing.

148
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:23,606
骗子的世界什么都是假的 即使是书面承诺
Yes, well, a liar's word is worthless, even ON paper.

149
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,826
你知道即使你是商人我还是会爱上你的
You know I'd love you just as much if you were a merchant captain?

150
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:38,856
<i>你不能离开两年之久
<i>And you wouldn't be gone for two years.

151
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:40,436
我不会离开两年之久的
I won't be gone two years.

152
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:43,516
贝德福德家的捕鲸人上周回来了 离开了有三年
A Bedford whaler came back last week was gone three.

153
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:46,756
她失去了两个男人 而且惊魂落魄
She lost two men and still with her hull half empty.

154
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:49,636
他们是贝德福德家 没有我在
Well, they were from Bedford and they didn't have me aboard.

155
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:56,326
婊子养的
Son of a bitch!

156
00:12:58,726 --> 00:13:01,276
我要指挥我自己的船
I will captain my own ship...

157
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:03,896
一艘捕鲸船
a whaling ship.

158
00:13:04,806 --> 00:13:07,126
靠他们我们只能永远在这个鬼地方
Up to them all we'd ever have is a patch of dirt

159
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:08,546
我不会让这发生的 佩吉
and that's not going to happen, Peggy.

160
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:10,996
你父亲也是这么说的 你不能这么说
Those'd be your father's words, not yours.

161
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:12,636
他的话怎么了
What's wrong with his words?

162
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:16,336
他想要为家人为自己争取
He wanted things for his family, for himself.

163
00:13:17,026 --> 00:13:19,766
他是个梦想家 欧文 是的 他是
- He was a dreamer, Owen - Yes, he was.

164
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:23,686
梦想大海 不带那些废物们出海
Dreamed of the sea and never got to sea with men like them.

165
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:25,936
至少他看到了他的孩子出生
At least he got to see his children born.

166
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:36,616
我只能干这些
It's all I know.

167
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:42,056
对不起
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,966
我嫁给了一个捕鲸人
I married a whaleman.

169
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:59,336
我会尽快回来 我发誓
I'll come back as quick as the sun is night, I swear.

170
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:13,726
一定要回来 向我保证
Please come back... promise me.

171
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,846
我已经向你发誓了 你还要我保证
I already swore to you, now you want me to promise, too.

172
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:25,116
我保证
I promise.

173
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:41,266
孩子 跟你说句话
Son, a word with you.

174
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:47,896
当船长 你不能当他们的朋友 你是他们的长官
To be a captain, you cannot be a friend, you are their superior.

175
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:51,106
别忘了这点 让别人记住这点
Never forget that, never let THEM forget that.

176
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:53,346
谢谢
Thank you, son.

177
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:57,446
你的曾祖父和其他人创立了这个行业
Your great-grandfather and a few others created this industry.

178
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:02,016
没有我们 没有你们 世界将会陷入黑暗
Without us, without you, the world plunges into darkness.

179
00:15:02,216 --> 00:15:05,226
我希望能让家族名誉生辉 先生
I hope to bring honor to the Pollard family name, Sir.

180
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:18,136
<i>啊 上帝创造了巨大的鲸 体长无比的神奇怪物
<i>Thou didst, O Lord, create the mighty whale, That wondrous monster of a mighty length;

181
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:22,366
<i>头硕身庞尾又阔 无边雄力人难度
<i>Beyond conception his unmeasured strength.

182
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:28,386
<i>恒古上帝宥永生 吾侪荏弱落凡尘
<i>But, everlasting God, thou dost ordain that we, poor feeble mortals

183
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:33,496
<i>妻儿一家须偷生
<i>should engage ourselves, our wives and children to maintain,

184
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:38,126
<i>赖此巨物维生存
<i>This dreadful monster with a martial rage.

185
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:46,356
<i>啊 上帝 用您的荣耀之光照亮这些男人
<i>O Father, grant that your glorious light shine on these men,

186
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:49,226
<i>保佑他们丰收的航程
<i>and assure them a prosperous voyage,

187
00:15:49,276 --> 00:15:53,106
<i>保佑他们安全归来
<i>that they may return SAFELY unto the womb ship.

188
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:57,026
<i>楠塔基特的白鲸油
<i>So that the white whales of Nantucket whale oil

189
00:15:57,226 --> 00:16:00,486
<i>可以继续照亮我们的房屋
<i>may continue to keep light in our homes,

190
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:07,146
<i>照亮我们的街道 为工业机器提供燃料
<i>city streets safe from sin in the night, fuel the machines of industry,

191
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:09,836
<i>推动我们伟大的国家前进
<i>drive our great nation forward,

192
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:16,436
<i>我们文明种族进步 我们祈祷
<i>as our noble species evolves. In Your name, we pray.

193
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:28,246
现在是几月
So, what month is this?

194
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:32,006
年末了 我们是最后一批出海的船只了
Oh, late in the year, we were one of the last ships to go out.

195
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:35,506
也是为什么我和我朋友巴尔齐莱有卧铺
Which is why my friend Barzillai and I got a berth.

196
00:16:35,706 --> 00:16:40,646
听着 我当时14岁
Look, I was fourteen... fourteen.

197
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:44,416
<i>尼克森 别站着 干活
<i>Nickerson, you're standin' around, boy! Move!

198
00:16:44,516 --> 00:16:48,066
<i>第一次出海 很害怕 更害怕显露出来
<i>First time at sea, scared, more scared to show it.

199
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,106
<i>巴尔齐莱当时17岁
<i>Barzillai was seventeen.

200
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:54,856
<i>在码头长大的孤儿</i>都等不及被别人视作大人
<i>Orphans, grew up on the wharf,</i> both in a hurry to be called men.

201
00:16:56,626 --> 00:17:00,866
<i>你们慢腾腾干嘛 装船 快 快
<i>What are you all guys waiting for? Get it aboard! C'mon! Haul away...!

202
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,026
他们戴的是饰针是什么
What are those pins they're wearing?

203
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:04,386
那些是白鲸徽章 汤姆斯
Those are whale pins, Thomas.

204
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:06,266
我怎么才能得到一个
How do I get one of them?

205
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,046
你得用长矛刺杀一头白鲸
Well, you've gotta thrust a killing lance.

206
00:17:09,246 --> 00:17:11,746
那是世界上最大的怪物
The largest beast ever to breathe on the earth.

207
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:15,566
<i>尼克森 把那绿色的东西给邦德先生
<i>Nickerson, get the green stuff to Mr. Bond.

208
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,176
<i>快点 妈的
<i>Make it quick, damn it.

209
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:21,696
我总有一天会有一堆那东西
I shall have twelve of those one day.

210
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:27,716
把它们放到匣子里
Put 'em on the Grandira casket.

211
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:30,516
你也上船就说明一件事
Well, well, you being on board means only one thing.

212
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:34,496
是啊 这船上至少有一人明白欧文·查斯是谁
Yep! At least there's one person on this ship who knows the truth about Owen Chase.

213
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:37,366
不 可惜其他的船都已经满员了
No, but all the other ships have already crewed up.

214
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:42,166
不不 我洗心革面了 欧文 问题是你呢
No, no, I'm a reformed man, Owen, the question is are YOU?

215
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:44,586
别告诉我花花公子马修戒酒了
Don't tell me Matthew Joy has put down the bottle.

216
00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:48,196
我有罪 欧文·查斯能消消他的坏脾气了吗
I have sinned. Has Owen Chase put down his temper?

217
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:50,086
平静的像教堂
Serene as the Church.

218
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:52,326
照我看来
I'll believe THAT when I see it.

219
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:58,566
考虑到我们的船长 我觉得你只能平静一小会儿
Given our captain I'll give your serenity about 48 hours.

220
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:00,806
祝你好运
Good luck.

221
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:10,386
波拉德 乔治·波拉德 欧文·查斯
- Pollard, George Pollard. - Owen Chase.

222
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:15,146
查斯 你父亲的名字对吗 对 是的
- Chase, your father's name, isn't it? - Yes, it is.

223
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:19,966
马上他要离开岛一段时间而我舒适得待在家
Very shortly he will be off island for some time and I'll be very much at home.

224
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:26,356
我要说 我有点意外 通常船长可以选择自己的大副
I say, I was surprised, normally a captain gets to choose his first mate.

225
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:28,776
如果是有经验的船长的话 是的
An experienced captain, yes.

226
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,866
当人 你可以理解老头的意思
Of course, you can understand from the owners' point of view,

227
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,416
他们想让自己的财产在适合的人手里
they wanted to put their investments in the hands of men.

228
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:34,916
确实
Indeed.

229
00:18:35,016 --> 00:18:37,956
他们也许想要多些保障
They probably wanted a little extra reassurance, that's all.

230
00:18:38,156 --> 00:18:41,046
看着点我 如果我做错什么了告诉我
Well, DO keep an eye on me, let me know if I'm doing anything wrong.

231
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,376
我不会迟疑的 船长
I'd have it not other way, Captain.

232
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:56,356
起锚
Shore up the anchor.

233
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:58,596
起风了 顶部横杆放下了吗 好
- Head's in the wind, is the top rail off? <i>- Aye.

234
00:18:58,716 --> 00:19:00,006
克拉德 掌舵 好
- Collard, Take the helm! - Aye!

235
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:01,186
花花公子 扬帆
Mr. Joy, make sail.

236
00:19:01,286 --> 00:19:03,866
科尔 查普尔 守在起锚器旁
Mr. Cole, Mr. Chappel, stand by this anchor!

237
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:26,826
查普尔 掌舵
Mr. Chappel, take the helm!

238
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:32,016
为什么帆布还没有松开
Boyd! Why aren't those braces laid out?

239
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:48,256
打开帆 妈的
Set the sail, god damn it!

240
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:57,056
跑开
Heading to scram.

241
00:19:57,156 --> 00:20:00,126
船长 注意头上 后面 船长
- Captain! Heads up! - Behind you head, Captain!

242
00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:06,446
怎么了 谢泼德 帆布缠住了 长官
- What happened, Mr. Sheppard? - The jalousie felled the sheet, Sir.

243
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:11,356
帆布缠住了 查斯 他办不到
- The jalousie's jammed! - Chase, she still won't clear!

244
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,856
<i>当心
<i>Watch your step!

245
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,166
帆布 欧文
It's the jalousie, Owen!

246
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:38,946
走开
Stand clear!

247
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,216
<i>干的漂亮 查斯
<i>Nice piece of work, Mr. Chase!

248
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:22,566
如果两周内能到佛得角
If we make Cape Verdes in the next 2 weeks we'll

249
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:25,926
我们有很大几率能按时到太平洋
have a decent chance of reaching the Pacific on schedule.

250
00:21:28,476 --> 00:21:30,436
玉米棒 查斯
Corn, Mr. Chase?

251
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:33,736
不需要 谢谢 从来不喜欢
No, thank you, Sir, never did have much of a taste for it.

252
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:36,016
太怪了
That's odd.

253
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:40,526
你爸在科德角是种玉米的吧 是的
- So, your father grew corn on Cape Cod. - That's right, he did.

254
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:43,916
你也猜到了 我那时天天吃这个吃腻了
As you can imagine, I suddenly grew tired of eating it every day.

255
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:52,136
种玉米 秋葵 大豆 然后他进了监狱
Corn, okra, beans, I believe? Before he went to jail.

256
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:57,366
花花公子 听起来熟悉吗
Are you familiar with this story, Mr. Joy?

257
00:21:59,106 --> 00:22:04,596
你知道查斯是因为他的父亲进监狱才变成孤儿的吗
Were you aware that Mr. Chase was effectively orphaned due to his father's incarceration?

258
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:08,136
我们都有不同的经历
Well, we all have our paths to sea.

259
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:11,726
所以还是不要问太多问题为好
That's a motive to not ask too many questions.

260
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:15,636
一定不容易吧
Can't have been easy though, yet...

You had Nantucket's great seafaring family to adopt you.

很久没有楠塔基特人称呼我陆人
This is far from the first time I've been called a landsman...

263
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:29,976

Well, well, Mr. Coffin, do you think a whale knows it's east of Halifax?

286
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:18,486
我不知道你们原来是谁 或者怎么来的
I don't know who all of you are, or how you got here,

Some of you probably have felonies, or are hidin' or on the run.

288
00:24:21,816 --> 00:24:26,806

That's fine, I don't give a damn, but we interred you for just one thing...

And even when the weather is fine and there ARE no whales, Mr. Coffin,

扬帆
Set stuns'ls.

325
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:18,876
这样做好吗 长官 我们接近洋流
Is that wise, Sir, we're near the Gulf Stream.

326
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:21,276
看这天气也还得缓慢前进
Best to be five knots fto even see the weather.

327
00:27:21,446 --> 00:27:23,366
我们落后两天行程了
We are two days behind.

328
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:26,866
<i>你得在东风来临前弥补上时间

<i>克芬 松开帆 船长要提速

<i>She might be old but she can still blow, boys!

335
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:41,976
长官 右舷方向有一飓风团 我们需要马上降帆
Sir, a squall on the starboard route, we need to shorten the sail immediately.

336
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:44,296
还不行 查斯
Not just yet, Mr. Chase.

337
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:46,696
长官 我们以8里的速度驶向风暴
Sir, we are headed into a storm of more than 8 knots

338
00:28:46,796 --> 00:28:47,916
而且速度越来越快
and it's movin' faster than that.

339
00:28:48,356 --> 00:28:50,606
让它来吧 水手们在陆地上呆久变软弱了
Let it come, the men are soft from months on land, they

340
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:54,156
他们需要一次洗礼 告诉他们工作开始了
need a good baptism, let them know our work has begun.

341
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:59,816
如果我们不降帆并驶离 风暴一定会追上我们的
If we don't shorten sail and bear off it'll catch us on the beam.

342
00:28:59,996 --> 00:29:02,986
查斯 我们继续向前航行
Chase, we will stand on.

343
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:07,336
劳伦斯 继续向前 继续向前 长官
- Mr. Lawrence, hold our course. - Holding course, Sir.

344
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,336
我们这样前行会追到只差半天的航程
We'll lose half a day running like that.

345
00:29:09,476 --> 00:29:11,506
我们最后能赶上 如果我们的人
We'll scut the end of it, if the men can't

346
00:29:11,556 --> 00:29:14,406

Best prepare for weather, Mr. Bond, we're headed into a squall.

349
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:12,316
我们必须降帆离开这里 退下 查斯先生
- We must fall off and run with it. - Stand down, Mr. Chase.

350
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:16,766
劳伦斯 航向不变 航向不变 长官
- Mr. Lawrence, hold your course. - Holding course, Sir.

351
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:34,466
降帆 查斯
Shorten the sails, Mr. Chase.

352
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:42,036
<i>我们要砍下那些帆
<i>We need to cut those sails down!

353
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,776
船掉头 向陆地开
Turn the ship, head for land!

354
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:05,966
不 损坏已经造成了
No, the damage is done!

355
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,856
太晚了 太他妈晚了
It's too late, it's too god damned late!

356
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:14,086
我们会撞上的
We'll be broadsided!

357
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:34,756
抓牢
Hold on!

358
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:05,346
<i>小心
<i>Look out!

359

花花公子
Mr. Joy!

360
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:31,486
<i>我们要割断 我知道了 欧文

<i>我们要让船摆正
<i>We have to set her up right!

362
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:28,896
你说要见我 长官
You wish to see me, Sir.

363
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:34,616
明天六时 你召集船员
At six bells tomorrow, you will assemble the crew,

364
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:38,916
告知他们我们将返回楠塔基特维修
inform them that we will be returning to Nantucket for repairs.

365
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:42,226
然后你向他们道歉你干涉了船长的命令
You will then apologize to them for interfering with a captain's order

366
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:45,936
今天差点让船上的每个人都为此丧命
which nearly cost the lives of every man on this ship today.

367
00:33:46,136 --> 00:33:46,686
什么
What?

368
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:49,546
返回到港口我会接受你的辞呈
I'll accept your resignation upon our return to port.

369
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:51,146
就这些
That will be all.

370
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:52,996
是你下命令杨帆的 长官
It was your order to set stuns'ls, Sir.

371
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:55,916
命令没问题 这些人需要锻炼
That decision was sound, the men needed testing.

372
00:33:55,986 --> 00:33:58,046
你送他们进风暴
- You sent 'em into a storm? - That...

373
00:33:58,246 --> 00:33:59,766
那是幸运不好
was unlucky.

374
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:03,906
不 这是缺乏航海经验 责怪运气只会显得软弱
No, it was bad seamanship, and blaming misfortune is just plain weakness.

375
00:34:04,006 --> 00:34:08,006
你他妈的无礼 你知道你在和谁说话吗
Damn your impertinence! Do you know who you're speaking to?

376
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:12,346
我是船长乔治·波拉德 波拉德
My name is CAPTAIN George Pollard. POLLARD!

377
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:19,536
而你查斯先生 无论你衣袖上钉多少白鲸徽章
And you Mr. Chase, no matter how many whale pins you may have on your lapel,

378
00:34:19,636 --> 00:34:21,866
你不过是个农民的儿子
are nothing more than the son of a farmer,

379
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:25,176
仗势欺人才当上的长官
who's managed to bullying his way into an officer's tunic.

380
00:34:26,486 --> 00:34:28,376
滚出去
Now, get out!

381
00:34:31,126 --> 00:34:35,536
不带一桶油回港口是个错误 长官
To return to port without a single barrel of oil would be a mistake, Sir.

382
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:41,156
<i>和名字是波拉德或者查斯没什么关系
<i>And not behoove a man whose name is Pollard... or Chase, for that matter.

383
00:34:41,356 --> 00:34:45,626
对我们来说最好是抓紧时间工作
And the best thing for both of us would be t'work all hours God sends us.

384
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:48,826
把船装满油一年之内回到家
Fill this ship with oil, and be home inside a year

385
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,566
然后各自分道扬镳
and rid of one another as quickly as possible.

386
00:34:54,366 --> 00:34:57,636
相信我 我也迫不及待这样做
Trust me, I have never been as desirous of that as you.

387
00:35:00,796 --> 00:35:03,586
当然 这由船长来做决定
Of course, that is the Captain's decision.

388

是的 所以我们向更远处前进

他们在说鲸油
They're talking whale oil.

487
00:47:13,946 --> 00:47:17,056
牧师坚持要我们写信回家告知我们的情况

488

我们马上出发 赶上南风带
We set sail now, catch the south easterlies,

<i>说鲸都藏在那里

这很正常

他们对你航行这么远的决定不满
They aren't happy with your decision to sail out this far.

你纠正他们的观点了吗

Did you remind them of our purpose to fill this ship with whale oil

543

如果那里有成百上千头鲸 为什么不去呢
and if the whales ARE a thousand leagues out, then that is where we go?

544
00:50:50,356 --> 00:50:56,876
表哥 拜托了 这太疯狂了

你被那人影响了
You have let yourself be influenced by that man.

546

你必须把船调头

It's simply a matter of numbers, Mr. Chappel.

水不够我们所有人用

但是 先生 我们都讲到这儿了
But, Sir! We've come so far.

700
01:13:40,406 --> 01:13:43,706
我们必须善始善终 我们有约定的 先生
- We have come to an end. - We have an agreement, Sir.

701
01:13:43,756 --> 01:13:46,896

Take the money and leave! You've a devil's bargain!

702

不 长官 魔鬼喜欢隐藏秘密
No, Sir, the devil loves his unspoken secrets...

703

我不是一个好作家
I'm not a great writer.

706

我不是霍索恩

我害怕如果我不写这个故事
I fear if I do not write it,

711

我会再也没办法写作

还有什么
What else?

713
01:14:47,096 --> 01:14:49,066
我害怕如果我写这个故事
I fear if I DO write it,

714
01:14:50,626 --> 01:14:53,666
写出来的不如故事精彩
that it will not be as good as it should be.

715
01:15:03,746 --> 01:15:05,786
继续讲这个故事 先生
Continue the story, Sir...

Sir, what are you doing?

735
01:17:25,906 --> 01:17:27,206
他在哪儿
Where is he?

736
01:19:28,716 --> 01:19:30,626
这可能是迪西岛
It could be Ducie Island.

737
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:34,536
没有地图 指南针 象限仪 没办法确认
Without a map, compass or quadrant there's no way to be certain.

738
01:19:34,746 --> 01:19:36,896
<i>我们昼夜都亮着火
<i>We will keep fires going night and day,

739

<i>这是我想让你们看的

They've been here a long time, for no doubt...

742
01:20:51,256 --> 01:20:52,686
一定也在等船只
waiting for a ship.

743
01:20:53,956 --> 01:20:55,236
但是没有船来过
But no ship came.

744

没有船会来
No ship is going to come.

745
01:21:00,626 --> 01:21:02,266
如果我们呆在这 我们会死
If we stay, we die.

<i>你们觉得如果鸟儿过来看到

<i>to stop coming here once they see their eggs eaten?

748
01:21:26,616 --> 01:21:30,416
这是知道自己将要死去的好处
It's a privilege to know the moment of one's death in advance.

749
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:32,476
可以为此准备
And to be able to prepare for it...

750
01:21:33,766 --> 01:21:36,756
离家太远的诅咒
a curse to be so far from home...

751
01:21:37,986 --> 01:21:42,216
或者有机会说再见但没机会和解
or a chance to say goodbyes, without a chance to make peace...

752
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:45,366
或者报仇的机会
or a chance to settle scores.

753
01:21:48,316 --> 01:21:51,056
但是 我们之间清楚了
But alas, at least those are settled between us,

754
01:21:51,486 --> 01:21:52,916
船长

什么船长
Captain of what?

756
01:21:57,026 --> 01:21:59,346
埃塞克斯号沉没了不是你的责任
The Essex was lost and no fault o'yours.

757
01:21:59,946 --> 01:22:02,486
我该受谴责 你不是船长
- I was as much to blame... - You were not the Captain!

758
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:10,216
你天生就是干这活的料
You were born to do this job.

759
01:22:11,056 --> 01:22:13,146
我只是生下来只能干这个
I was just born into it.

760
01:22:25,896 --> 01:22:27,896
我们干了什么 你觉得 乔治
What we do, do ya think, George?

761
01:22:29,526 --> 01:22:33,596
我们干了什么冒犯了上帝 让他这么不开心
What offense did we give God to upset him so?

762
01:22:33,646 --> 01:22:36,546
冒犯上帝的是那些白鲸
The only creature to have offended God here is the whale.

763
01:22:37,346 --> 01:22:38,536
不是我们
Not us?

764
01:22:40,446 --> 01:22:44,066
不是我们的傲慢 我们的贪婪 看我们现在在哪儿
Not our arrogance, our greed? Look where we find ourselves.

765
01:22:44,116 --> 01:22:46,646
我们是上帝按自己喜好创造出来的高级生物
We are supreme creatures made in God's own likeness.

766
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:49,676
我们是地球上的主宰
We're earthly kings,

767
01:22:49,926 --> 01:22:53,726
我们要环航我们居住的星球
whose business it is to circumnavigate the planet bestowed to us.

768
01:22:54,316 --> 01:22:56,476
将自然屈服于我们的意志
And to bend nature to OUR will.

769
01:22:56,586 --> 01:23:00,146
我们经历了这么多你还觉得主宰一切吗
You really feel like an earthly king after everything that we've been through?

770
01:23:01,626 --> 01:23:06,116
我们什么都不是 我们是微粒 灰尘 但是我们
- We're nothing... we're specks... dust. - But we're...

771
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,226
拂晓时朝太阳方向行驶
We sail into the sun at dawn.

772
01:23:10,556 --> 01:23:14,186
如果我们要死 死在上帝的光辉里
If we are to die, with God's grace.

773
01:23:15,196 --> 01:23:17,126
让我们像男人一样死去
Let us die as men.

937
01:43:50,186 --> 01:43:52,676
将会有一场听证会
it seems there will be an inquiry.

938
01:43:53,136 --> 01:43:57,576
作为船长和大副 我们需要交待事实经过
And, as Captain and first mate, we will be expected to give account of what happened.

939
01:43:58,026 --> 01:43:59,356
是的 当然
Yes, of course.

940
01:43:59,416 --> 01:44:04,096
我就这件事和船主和我父亲讨论过
And, having discussed this with the ship owners and... my father,

941
01:44:05,106 --> 01:44:08,686
显然完全交待经过会有后果
it is clear that full disclosure will have ramifications...

942
01:44:09,336 --> 01:44:12,176
对整个行业有可怕的后果
terrible ramifications for whole industry.

943
01:44:13,126 --> 01:44:15,626
一头白鲸弄沉了埃塞克斯号
That a whale brought down the Essex.

944
01:44:16,656 --> 01:44:18,946
但这是事实
But it's the truth.

945
01:44:26,106 --> 01:44:29,996
如果保险商和投资人开始担心
If the insurance houses and investors were to start worrying about...

946
01:44:30,076 --> 01:44:32,976
海怪把船弄沉
sea monsters sinking ships,

947
01:44:33,296 --> 01:44:36,036
水手们很难活下来
sailors drawing lots to survive...

948
01:44:37,266 --> 01:44:40,866
我们在石油行业 所有人
We are in the oil business... all of us.

949
01:44:41,496 --> 01:44:46,996
在任何一个行业成功的机率一定要比失败的风险要高
And as in any business the probability of success must always be greater the risk incurred.

950
01:44:48,786 --> 01:44:50,656
那么 你有什么建议 乔治
So, what are you suggesting, George?

951
01:44:50,886 --> 01:44:53,096
你就说船搁浅了
That you say that the ship ran aground.

952
01:44:54,266 --> 01:44:56,976
那是个谎言 并且说船员是淹死的
- That's a lie. - And that the men that died drowned.

953
01:44:57,406 --> 01:44:58,186
那也是个谎言
That's another lie.

954
01:44:58,236 --> 01:45:00,186
想想吧 他们会让你当船长
Think on it... they will make you captain.

955
01:45:00,226 --> 01:45:02,496
那个我是有书面保证的
Oh! That pledge I already have in writing.

956
01:45:02,606 --> 01:45:06,606
<i>那个前提是你带回一船的鲸油
<i>Only on the condition you bring home a ship full of oil.

957
01:45:07,866 --> 01:45:09,546
这么做会确保你这件事
This way it's guaranteed.

958
01:45:09,746 --> 01:45:12,036
你会变成有钱人
You would be a wealthy man.

959
01:45:12,176 --> 01:45:16,476
查斯不再是陆人的名字 而是有记录的
The name Chase need no longer be a landsman's name, but an established name

960
01:45:16,506 --> 01:45:20,026
属于楠塔基特岛伟大家族的名字
that belongs among the great families of Nantucket.

961
01:45:20,806 --> 01:45:23,366
你要我为了功名掩盖发生的一切
You want me to whitewash what happened for profit?

962
01:45:24,066 --> 01:45:27,246
我们是要你务实些
We're asking you to be pragmatic.

963
01:45:42,746 --> 01:45:45,556
埃塞克斯号是被一头白鲸撞沉的
The Essex was stoved by a white whale.

964
01:45:46,036 --> 01:45:48,866
我们幸存下来的在装备不良的捕鲸船上
And those of us that survived in ill-equipped whale boats

965
01:45:48,936 --> 01:45:53,106
只能靠犯下罪孽才能存活
had to commit abominations in order to survive.

966
01:45:53,266 --> 01:45:57,406
我们回来后 又被指望传播公然露骨的谎言
And on our return, we're expected to spread barefaced lies,

967
01:45:57,766 --> 01:46:00,916
好让你们这些楠塔基特岛岛船主们
so that you, the ship owners of Nantucket,

968
01:46:01,376 --> 01:46:04,286
赚钱晚上再睡得安稳觉吗
might line your pockets and sleep well at night?

969
01:46:05,406 --> 01:46:08,876
我不会掩盖真相
Well, I will not embroil the truth.

970
01:46:08,926 --> 01:46:10,756
乔治 你也不应该
Nor should you, George.

971
01:46:30,266 --> 01:46:32,126
<i>我最后一次见他
<i>That last time I saw him...

972
01:46:32,466 --> 01:46:33,876
查斯先生 长官
Mr. Chase, Sir.

973
01:46:34,316 --> 01:46:37,876
<i>我说不出我想说的话
<i>I couldn't find the right words to say what I wanted.

974
01:46:38,736 --> 01:46:40,016
汤姆斯
Thomas.

975
01:46:41,006 --> 01:46:42,776
<i>也许我没什么想说的
<i>Perhaps there ARE no words.

976
01:46:45,176 --> 01:46:48,196
我 我要去法尔茅斯了
I'm... I'm gonna be on my way to Falmouth, and...

977
01:46:51,326 --> 01:46:52,986
那个
it's...

978
01:46:53,116 --> 01:46:55,426
那个 很荣幸 长官
it's... it's been an honor, Sir,

979
01:46:55,746 --> 01:46:57,566
能够服务于您
to serve with you.

980
01:47:00,826 --> 01:47:03,636
是我的荣幸 尼克森先生
The honor has been mine, Mr. Nickerson.

981
01:47:20,816 --> 01:47:22,536
拿着
Take it.

982
01:47:27,096 --> 01:47:28,996
祝你好运 汤姆斯
Good luck out there, Thomas.

983
01:47:30,106 --> 01:47:31,806
谢谢 长官
Thank you, Sir.

984
01:48:00,696 --> 01:48:03,986
第二天乔治·波拉德被召唤到听证会
Next day George Pollard was called before the inquiry.

985
01:48:08,526 --> 01:48:10,866
先生们 船长乔治·波拉德
Gentlemen, Captain George Pollard.

986
01:48:11,406 --> 01:48:13,976
<i>楠塔基特所有重要人物都在那儿
<i>All the important men of Nantucket were there...

987
01:48:14,956 --> 01:48:17,306
<i>这是惯例
<i>it was a formality.

988
01:48:17,906 --> 01:48:20,296
<i>日安 船长 请坐
<i>Good day to you, Captain, please sit down.

989
01:48:25,876 --> 01:48:27,676
<i>事实是
<i>For the record then.

990
01:48:29,506 --> 01:48:35,126
埃塞克斯号是在厄瓜多尔以西被一头1200多米长的白鲸撞沉的
The Essex was stoved by a white whale 12 hundred meters west of Ecuador.

991
01:48:35,196 --> 01:48:38,226
就像欧文·查斯说的那样
It was as if Owen Chase himself had spoken.

992
01:48:39,896 --> 01:48:42,006
他告诉了他们真相
He told them the truth.

993
01:48:45,366 --> 01:48:47,956
<i>船长波拉德的良心发现了
<i>Cap'n Pollard's conscience was clear...

994
01:48:49,066 --> 01:48:51,526
<i>但那场听证会是个耻辱
<i>but the inquiry was a sham.

995
01:48:53,016 --> 01:48:55,456


996
01:48:57,506 --> 01:49:01,486
至于那头白鲸 他们再也没有找到
over the white whale... they never found it.

997
01:49:02,776 --> 01:49:05,706
<i>他再一次出航但在夏威夷搁浅
<i>He ran a second ship aground off of Hawaii...

998
01:49:06,816 --> 01:49:08,036
<i>两次诅咒
<i>twice cursed.

999
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:11,306
再也没有出航过
Never sailed again.

1000
01:49:11,556 --> 01:49:13,206
欧文·查斯
And Owen Chase?

1001
01:49:14,306 --> 01:49:16,346
他说到做到
He was a man of his word.

1002
01:49:16,776 --> 01:49:19,746
他派了一艘船去了杜斯特岛
First, he sent a boat back to Ducie Island.

1003
01:49:20,816 --> 01:49:22,656
花花公子已经死了
Mr. Joy had passed...

1004
01:49:22,916 --> 01:49:26,426
但是其他人居然还都活着
but the other three were incredibly still alive.

1005
01:49:29,276 --> 01:49:30,546
然后呢
And then?

1006
01:49:31,066 --> 01:49:34,666
他带着家人搬到了新贝德福德
Then he packed up his family and moved to New Bedford...

1007
01:49:36,656 --> 01:49:38,286
<i>去重新开始生活
<i>to start over...

1008
01:49:38,766 --> 01:49:40,806
<i>在一家商店
<i>in a merchant...

1009
01:49:41,066 --> 01:49:43,456
<i>完成自己的人生旅程
<i>sailing his own terms.

1010
01:49:52,676 --> 01:49:56,146
<i>你用钱换到故事了 梅尔维尔先生
<i>Well, you certainly got your money's worth, Mr. Melville.

1011
01:49:56,396 --> 01:49:58,786
这二月的夜晚真是一年中最漫长的
These February nights are the longest of the year.

1012
01:49:59,076 --> 01:50:02,136
你们都可以休息了 我不行
- Well, you can both rest now. - Leave me...

1013
01:50:02,446 --> 01:50:05,316
我还有一段时间不能休息
I shall not be resting for some time.

1014
01:50:05,566 --> 01:50:06,996
<i>为什么
<i>Why?

1015
01:50:07,716 --> 01:50:12,886
你得到了你的故事 情节都有了
Ya got your story there, and your plot is all there.

1016
01:50:12,936 --> 01:50:16,666
也许我想要的不是情节
Maybe it wasn't a plot I was after.

1017
01:50:16,816 --> 01:50:18,876
不是 那是什么
No, what then?

1018
01:50:19,056 --> 01:50:21,556
你今晚给我的其他东西
Something else you've given me tonight.

1019
01:50:21,606 --> 01:50:23,116
是什么
What is that?

1020
01:50:23,696 --> 01:50:28,386
敢于去别人不敢去的地方的勇气
The courage to go where... one does not want to go.

1021
01:50:29,806 --> 01:50:31,646
梅尔维尔先生
Mr. Melville,

1022
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:34,986
你听到的 我告诉你的
what you've heard, what I've told you,

1023
01:50:37,666 --> 01:50:42,156
是否都会成为你书中的一部分
will it all be of service to your book?

1024
01:50:43,246 --> 01:50:46,846
这会是部虚构的小说 尼克森先生
It will be a work of fiction, Mr. Nickerson,

1025
01:50:47,996 --> 01:50:49,916
受真实事件启发
inspired by truth,

1026
01:50:51,036 --> 01:50:54,636
但我不觉得我会用全部事实
but I don't believe I'll feel the need to use all of it.

1027
01:51:03,396 --> 01:51:04,726
谢谢 给
- Thank you. - Here...

1028
01:51:05,206 --> 01:51:06,416
拿着这个
take that with you.

1029
01:51:06,476 --> 01:51:08,826
不 钱是给你的 我坚持
No, the money is for you, I insist.

1030
01:51:09,986 --> 01:51:11,226
我坚持你要收下
I insist you keep it.

1031
01:51:11,566 --> 01:51:16,116
我坚持这谈话里还是有一个人是清醒的
And I insist that one person in this conversation is sober.

1032
01:51:26,266 --> 01:51:29,286
该回马萨诸塞州皮茨菲尔德了
So, it's back to Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

1033
01:51:29,816 --> 01:51:32,376
祝你好运
Well, good luck.

1034
01:51:33,486 --> 01:51:34,746
谢谢
Thank you.

1035
01:51:38,186 --> 01:51:39,616
你知道吗
Ya know...

1036
01:51:39,946 --> 01:51:43,816
<i>我听说宾夕法尼亚州一个人最近在地上钻了一个洞
<i>I heard a man from Pennsylvania drilled a hole in the ground recently,

1037
01:51:44,596 --> 01:51:46,326
发现了油
and found oil.

1038
01:51:46,796 --> 01:51:48,636
不会是真的吧
That can't be true.

1039
01:51:49,116 --> 01:51:50,636
我也听说过
I heard it, too.

1040
01:51:52,436 --> 01:51:55,456
地上的油
Oil from ground.

1041
01:51:56,566 --> 01:51:59,006
真想不到
Fancy that.

1042
01:52:29,566 --> 01:52:38,006
赫尔曼·梅尔维尔 1850年完成了他的小说

1043
01:52:41,566 --> 01:52:48,006
一年后白鲸记发表

1044
01:52:50,566 --> 01:52:58,006
对于白鲸记纳撒尼尔·霍桑盛赞它会成为美国伟大的作品
