1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,450
In one of the most remote and
unspoiled wildernesses on the planet,

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,050
a bizarre array of creatures
struggle to survive.

3
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,250
The place is the ever-changing Eden

4
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,050
called Tasmania¡­

5
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,850
an island sanctuary for an assortment of
creatures found nowhere else in the world,

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,650
located about 240 kilometres south

7
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,050
of mainland Australia.

8
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,950
Standing alone in what many
call the Southern Ocean,

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,650
Tasmania endures the most
relentless winds and seas on Earth.

10
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,550
This area, known as the roaring forties,

11
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,650
collects moisture from both the Atlantic

12
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,450
and the Indian Oceans,

13
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,750
and parts of the sparsely populated island

14
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,150
see more than 250cm of rain each year.

15
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,150
As the air rises,

16
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,050
the rain turns to sleet,

17
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,350
and the sleet to snow,

18
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,050
signalling the arrival of winter.

19
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,750
Seeking refuge deep inside a hollow tree

20
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,250
is an eastern quoll.

21
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,350
The quoll is a marsupial,

22
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,550
and her 4 babies have been out of the pouch

23
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,050
for just one week.

24
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,450
They depend completely on their mother

25
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,550
for warmth and food.

26
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,550
In order to produce enough milk

27
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,350
to suckle her young through winter,

28
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,050
the quoll must leave them to find food.

29
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,150
At 1,500 metres up,

30
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,150
few animals can survive,

31
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,350
and the cat-sized eastern quoll

32
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,450
is the largest carnivorous marsupial

33
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,550
to be found at this altitude.

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,850
The quoll keeps an eye out
for small birds and mammals

35
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,350
that could make a meal.

36
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,350
But instead,

37
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,750
she spots a struggling wombat.

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,250
At one metre long,

39
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,250
the wombat is the world's largest burrowing mammal,

40
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,550
and far too big for the quoll to eat.

41
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,050
But she's curious ¨C

42
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,050
the wombat seems to be treading on thin ice.

43
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,350
Cries from the nest

44
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,550
signal that the quoll babies
want their mother to return.

45
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,250
She'll have to hunt later

46
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,850
when they're asleep.

47
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,650
Introduced predators such as dingoes and foxes

48
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,250
have rendered eastern quolls

49
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,250
all but extinct on the Australian mainland.

50
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,150
Tasmania is believed to be their last refuge.

51
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,450
After its narrow escape on the ice,

52
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,950
the wombat moves more cautiously.

53
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,250
It survives on a diet of grass and roots,

54
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,050
and must drink regularly.

55
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,850
Wombats sometimes travel many kilometres

56
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,150
in order to find fresh water.

57
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,850
A white-breasted sea eagle

58
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,850
follows the path of Tasmania's
highest mountain chain,

59
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,750
the Du Cane Range.

60
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,250
The eagle bears witness
to a rare Australian sight.

61
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,650
The peaks may only be 1,500m high,

62
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,750
but for a few weeks each winter

63
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,450
they are shrouded in snow.

64
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,650
Tasmania was once connected

65
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,650
to the Australian mainland by a land bridge.

66
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,150
About 11 or 12,000 years ago,

67
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,350
rising sea levels cut it away,

68
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,450
creating this unique habitat.

69
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,650
Tasmania is home to one of the world's
largest expanses of temperate rainforest.

70
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,150
It is one of the only places on Earth

71
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,650
where you can see jungle covered in snow.

72
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,250
Even in the valleys,

73
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,150
animals must endure freezing cold winters.

74
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,750
The echidna manages to survive here

75
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,950
because it has thicker fur than
its relatives on the mainland.

76
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,550
It seeks out patches of soil between the snow,

77
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,450
then uses its long snout

78
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,350
to detect its staple foods

79
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,950
ants, termites and worms.

80
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,950
The snout is so sensitive to vibration,

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,650
it can locate the tiny animals

82
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,750
even when they are deep underground.

83
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,350
Unfortunately, all the echidna finds today

84
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,050
is a shivering potoroo

85
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,850
a rat-size marsupial

86
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,950
and relative of the kangaroo.

87
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,550
For the Tasmanian blue-tongue lizard,

88
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,650
the cold is too severe.

89
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,550
He spends the winter asleep

90
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,650
under a blanket of leaf litter.

91
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,750
In the lowland rainforest,

92
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,750
even a few days of winter sunlight

93
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,450
can completely melt the snow.

94
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,850
A female Tasmanian devil

95
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,650
takes advantage of the sunshine

96
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,150
and moves her family to a new den.

97
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,450
Her babies are just a few months old,

98
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,850
so they still rely on her
for food and transportation.

99
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,650
These scavengers were named "devils"
by early European settlers

100
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,150
because of their bad 'tempers'

101
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,550
and spine-chilling screeches.

102
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,150
Suddenly, the mother hears a cry from the old den.

103
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,350
She has left one of her daughters behind.

104
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,450
The mother scuttles back to rescue it.

105
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,950
Tasmanian devils give birth to 20 or more young,

106
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,450
but the mother can only nurse four.

107
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,850
So only the strongest will survive

108
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,550
and eventually emerge from the pouch.

109
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,050
When these 3 young males compete for milk,

110
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,350
their smaller sister is often squeezed out.

111
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,250
Today is just not her day.

112
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,750
She's been left behind,

113
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,250
missed her meal,

114
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,350
and now it seems

115
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,250
she's been forgotten again.

116
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,650
But this time,

117
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,650
the mother remembers to call her.

118
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,250
This pademelon wallaby

119
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,550
has just one joey to take care of,

120
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,550
so he's not nearly as likely to be misplaced.

121
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,850
He will abandon the sanctuary
of the pouch in the spring.

122
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,050
But right now,

123
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,250
the pouch provides both food and shelter

124
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,950
so there's very little incentive to leave.

125
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,050
As spring arrives,

126
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,450
the alpine ice begins to melt

127
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,350
and the water feeds the streams.

128
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,150
This is when Tasmania's many rivers and waterfalls

129
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,250
reach their highest levels.

130
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,950
And at this time of year,

131
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,050
the rivers and estuaries
are also brimming with fish.

132
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,550
It's the perfect time for the sea eagle to feast

133
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,850
The sea eagle is the ultimate aerial predator.

134
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,950
Its two-metre wingspan

135
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,250
gives it aerodynamic versatility,

136
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,750
but it's also cunning.

137
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,450
When stalking,

138
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,250
a sea eagle flies towards the sun

139
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,350
to prevent its shadow falling ahead

140
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,050
and warning prey of its approach.

141
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,050
It then swoops in low

142
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,950
and takes the fish by surprise.

143
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,950
Sea eagles rarely miss,

144
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,850
and the technique is so effective

145
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,450
that they only need to
spend 10 minutes a day hunting.

146
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,750
As spring warms the coast,

147
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,950
millions of seabirds flock to Tasmania to feed.

148
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,450
Migratory stints and shearwaters

149
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,150
join permanent residents
like the cormorants and swans.

150
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,250
And Tasmania's offshore islands

151
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,950
are colonized by gannets and shy albatrosses,

152
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,850
who gorge themselves in preparation for breeding

153
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,150
Due to a collision of ocean currents,

154
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,050
the seas surrounding Tasmania

155
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,250
form some of the most biologically unique

156
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,050
cold water habitats in the world.

157
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,050
Giant kelp-forests,

158
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,150
up to 65 metres tall,

159
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,750
dance in the swell

160
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,250
and provide a home for a host
of bizarre sea creatures.

161
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,250
Some display bold patterns or colours.

162
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,650
Others, like the weedy sea dragon
and the leafy sea dragon,

163
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,050
have had millions of years to
evolve almost perfect camouflage.

164
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,450
In the weeks following the long winter,

165
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,250
the sea remains cold,

166
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,750
and this triggers Tasmania's
marine creatures to breed.

167
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,050
This male giant cuttlefish snatches a female

168
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,750
right under the watchful eye of a rival.

169
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,250
During the act of mating,

170
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,150
the nearly one metre long male

171
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,650
places a sperm sac inside the smaller female.

172
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,250
The female stores the sperm in 2 special organs

173
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,050
until she is ready to fertilize her eggs.

174
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,450
With big-bellied seahorses,

175
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,750
it is the male rather than
the female, who gives birth.

176
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,850
But first he has to persuade
her to hand over her eggs.

177
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,050
The male displays his swollen
pouch to attract a mate

178
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,050
and deter any rivals.

179
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,950
The pair then performs a courtship dance

180
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,650
that can last for several days.

181
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,650
Once the female is suitably seduced,

182
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,550
she transfers her eggs into his pouch.

183
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,650
The male is then responsible

184
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,350
for fertilizing and incubating the eggs,

185
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,350
and eventually giving birth to the babies.

186
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,450
The courtship rituals employed
by Australian carpet sharks

187
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,450
are anything but tender.

188
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,250
The male tries to seduce his intended

189
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,950
by biting her violently,

190
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,150
and females must often contend

191
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,450
with several suitors at once.

192
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,650
Once the male has secured a mate,

193
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,750
he will hold her in a pre-mating grasp for hours

194
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,650
until eventually she allows him to mate with her.

195
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,550
Then immediately afterwards,

196
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,050
the relationship is over

197
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,850
and the male leaves in search of another mate.

198
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,250
During spring,

199
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,150
Tasmania's highlands are bathed in sunshine.

200
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,850
The warmth awakens the frost-covered vegetation

201
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,550
and turns the winter ice to water.

202
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,350
Alpine flowers now flaunt their colours.

203
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,150
At four months old,

204
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,150
the young eastern quolls are
nearly as big as their mother.

205
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,050
They emerge from their den

206
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,050
to explore their surroundings.

207
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,450
A venomous tiger snake

208
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,250
is on the lookout for a meal,

209
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,050
and an inexperienced marsupial like this

210
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,850
makes an easy target.

211
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,850
The quoll retreats to the safety of the den

212
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,150
but the snake won't give up that easily.

213
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,950
It hasn't eaten since autumn.

214
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,950
Following her instincts,

215
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,650
the mother stands between
the snake and her young,

216
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,550
even though she is putting
her own life on the line.

217
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,650
Her show of aggression succeeds,

218
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,050
and the snake slithers away.

219
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,450
For now at least,

220
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,950
her family is safe.

221
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,950
As temperatures rise,

222
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,650
the last remnants of fog
disappear from the rainforest.

223
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,850
Sunlight begins to penetrate
deep into isolated valleys

224
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,550
that contain some of the oldest

225
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,950
and tallest trees in the world.

226
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,350
There are trees here 90 metres high,

227
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,750
and some are over 2,000 years old.

228
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,350
The blue-tongue lizard emerges from hibernation.

229
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,950
He is hungry,

230
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,750
and on the lookout for a meal.

231
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,350
The potoroo rarely ventures
far from dense cover.

232
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,750
It uses its long nose to forage for fungi.

233
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,850
But today it finds some fruit.

234
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,050
Soon, the lizard joins in the feast.

235
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,750
Nearby, a carnivorous tiger quoll

236
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,850
is also looking for food.

237
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,950
It follows the scent trail of a potential victim

238
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,050
but then spots an easier target.

239
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,850
The Tasmanian devil is Australia's
largest carnivorous marsupial,

240
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,850
and it possesses an excellent sense of smell.

241
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,050
She moves in for the kill.

242
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,350
The tiger quoll quickly retreats.

243
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,450
He is not prepared to risk his life,

244
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,050
and he knows he is no match for the devil.

245
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,150
Tasmanian devils have jaws as
strong as a dog 4 times their size,

246
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,850
and the hungrier they are

247
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,850
the more aggressive they are.

248
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,650
The mother devil often leaves
her 6 month old offspring

249
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,650
while she searches for food.

250
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,050
For the youngsters, it's a chance to play

251
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,750
and explore the lush world around them.

252
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,750
The little female is content
to bask in the sun.

253
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,250
But with three boisterous brothers around,

254
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,950
it's difficult to get any peace.

255
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,750
The males still like to ride
on their mothers back,

256
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,650
even though they are far too big to do so.

257
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,950
It won't be long

258
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,150
before the mother will leave them
all to fend for themselves.

259
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,050
Her patience is already wearing thin.

260
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,250
Once again, there's no room for the little female.

261
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,950
She is fast becoming the outcast of the family.

262
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,150
By summer,

263
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,750
the sun-baked mountains are
completely free of snow.

264
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,550
Many of the alpine plants found here

265
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,050
do not occur anywhere else in the world.

266
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,550
Massive cushion plants dominate the landscape.

267
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,950
The giant pandani is the world's
largest heath plant,

268
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,450
standing up to 12 metres tall.

269
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,350
The buttongrass plains are home to many animals.

270
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,250
A mountain dragon basks in the summer sun,

271
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,250
but keeps one eye on the wombat

272
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,650
as it bulldozes through the scrub.

273
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,150
It's on the lookout for water again¡­

274
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,850
and so is the tiger snake.

275
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,450
In mid summer,

276
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,050
even temperatures in the highlands

277
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,750
can soar to more than 30 degrees Celsius,

278
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,350
so freshwater streams are popular destinations.

279
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,950
The ungainly wombat disturbs the tiger snake.

280
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,250
It is one of the most venomous
snakes in the world,

281
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,450
and not to be toyed with.

282
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,750
The wombat wisely decides to give way.

283
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,650
Nearby, a male eastern quoll

284
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,250
is looking for some shade from the scorching sun,

285
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,750
but he's being attacked by mosquitoes.

286
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,150
A skink turns the quoll's attention to food.

287
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,550
The stunned reptile

288
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,150
releases its tail as a defence mechanism.

289
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,950
The quoll devours it as a starter,

290
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,350
then consumes the main course.

291
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,750
No reptile, bird or small mammal

292
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,650
is safe from jaws of this carnivore.

293
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,050
Tasmania's kangaroos are out in force,

294
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,250
enjoying the summer sun.

295
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,650
Now that some of the joeys
have left the pouch,

296
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,850
the females are ready to mate again¡­

297
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,050
and there's always a willing male to be found.

298
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,050
Meanwhile, the youngsters start
learning how to be independent.

299
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,550
The odd one takes the easy option

300
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,750
and goes back to the pouch to drink,

301
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,550
but most are now eating grass.

302
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,850
Offshore, thousands of gannets have
taken up residence on Pedra Branca Island

303
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,850
off Tasmania's south coast.

304
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,850
The males and females greet each other
with a ritualized display.

305
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,550
Each couple raises just one chick.

306
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,950
This one is 7 weeks old,

307
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,550
and still covered in down feathers.

308
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,250
As summer progresses,

309
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,050
these soft feathers will be shed

310
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,750
first from the wings,

311
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,850
then the body,

312
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,250
and finally from the head.

313
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,850
Older chicks often pester
and bully the younger ones.

314
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,750
Off the northwest coast of Tasmania,

315
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,650
shy albatrosses gather to breed

316
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,350
on the aptly named Albatross Island.

317
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,350
The fluffy 8-week-old chicks
depend on their parents for food.

318
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,950
Even in mid-summer,

319
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,950
the birds need thick down feathers

320
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,250
to protect them against any weather
the roaring forties may bring.

321
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,550
It's difficult to survive here,

322
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,150
and up to half of the island's 5,000 chicks

323
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,350
will be lost to either starvation

324
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,950
or the elements.

325
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,750
Exposed to 16 hours of light
every day during summer,

326
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,450
the rainforest soon becomes parched.

327
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,550
The echidna might not have to
overcome icy obstacles any more,

328
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,950
but he must now contend with bone dry soil.

329
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,950
If he detects something edible,

330
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,150
his short limbs and powerful claws

331
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,850
can dig through even the hardest terrain.

332
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,550
He is now permanently out of the pouch,

333
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,650
but the pademelon joey still
stays close to his mother.

334
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,050
For youngsters,

335
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,650
the rainforest can be a frightening place.

336
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,650
A young cockatoo begs to be fed,

337
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,150
and its mother obliges.

338
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,950
The commotion attracts the
attention of the tiger quoll.

339
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,650
Although it's adapted for life in the trees,

340
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,050
the quoll more often finds
its meals on the ground.

341
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,850
A young pademelon,

342
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,350
away from its mother,

343
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,250
makes a perfect target.

344
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,850
The predator uses the tree canopy as cover

345
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,050
to sneak up behind its quarry.

346
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,350
It takes just one lethal bite
to the joey's neck.

347
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,250
The tiger quoll can kill animals
over 3 times its own size.

348
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,550
The noise and the scent have
alerted the mother devil,

349
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,650
who is hot on the quoll's trail again.

350
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,050
Once more, the quoll must relinquish
its prize to its rival.

351
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,450
Tasmanian devils will hunt mammals and birds,

352
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,850
but they mostly scavenge and are equipped

353
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,050
with some of the strongest jaws
in the animal kingdom.

354
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,250
One of her 10 month old sons

355
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,650
tries to claim the meal for himself.

356
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,450
The quarrel draws one of his brothers.

357
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,450
Realizing she is out-numbered,

358
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,250
the mother devil takes a last look
at her children,

359
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,050
then leaves the area for good.

360
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,350
The brothers must now compete for the spoils.

361
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,850
The third son takes his place
at the carcass unopposed.

362
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,350
But once again,

363
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,250
the young female is left out.

364
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,050
Her brothers refuse to let her share in the feast.

365
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,850
The male devils will continue to squabble,

366
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,650
until they head off to live on their own.

367
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,250
The land has been sun-baked throughout the summer,

368
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,650
but the seas surrounding Tasmanian

369
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,250
are only just reaching their peak temperature.

370
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,650
This is when many marine creatures give birth.

371
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,050
But for others,

372
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,550
the warm water triggers aggression.

373
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,650
The carpet shark has found an octopus.

374
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,950
But the scent of blood in the water

375
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,050
attracts rivals to the scene

376
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,550
and starts a feeding frenzy.

377
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,350
Scavengers grab whatever they can

378
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,050
before the victor claims the prize.

379
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,150
A blue devil fish waits for his meal to hatch

380
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,450
in the form of baby cuttlefish.

381
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,250
Just 2.5cm long and defenceless,

382
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,750
many will not survive for more than a few minutes.

383
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,150
The mother tasselled anglerfish

384
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,650
reduces the risk of losing her young

385
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,150
by guarding her eggs until they hatch.

386
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,750
She has laid about 5,000 eggs

387
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,650
which are bound together in a gelatinous mass.

388
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,650
The young are only 1cm long,

389
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,650
yet already they resemble their mother.

390
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,750
At just 15mm long,

391
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,050
newborn seahorses are also perfect miniatures

392
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,450
of their father.

393
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,150
There's safety in numbers,

394
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,550
so their first instinct is to congregate.

395
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,950
They will grasp onto anything,

396
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,850
even each other.

397
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,850
During autumn the sea remains warm,

398
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,950
but temperatures above the water

399
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,750
are starting to cool.

400
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,550
The gannet chicks are preparing
to become independent.

401
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,050
By 3 months old,

402
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,750
their cries for food are already ignored.

403
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,950
The chicks have lost most
of their down feathers,

404
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,850
but are still prone to squabble.

405
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,350
Soon they will all leave the island,

406
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,450
only to return when they themselves

407
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,350
are ready to breed.

408
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,650
Now 4 months old,

409
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,050
the albatross chicks have doubled
in size since the summer.

410
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,150
Only the youngest chicks
still have down feathers,

411
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,850
and most have developed adult features.

412
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,350
The albatross has the longest
fledgling period of any bird.

413
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,250
And after several months of dependency,

414
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,250
it seems hard for the chick
to understand why its mother

415
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,350
now refuses to feed it.

416
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,750
The fledglings regularly flap their wings

417
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,050
in preparation for their first flight.

418
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,750
Even with a 2-metre wingspan,

419
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,050
each must wait for exactly the right wind

420
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,850
to help it lift off.

421
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,450
Finally, the moment arrives.

422
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,250
The young chicks watch the older ones leave.

423
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,350
Most of these birds will return
to breed after a few years,

424
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,050
but the albatross is unique

425
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,650
in that some remain at sea
for up to 9 years.

426
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,450
Autumn is when the animals
of the button-grass breed.

427
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,050
At 10 months old,

428
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,150
a newly-independent female quoll

429
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,150
looks for her first partner.

430
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,350
Female quolls woo males,

431
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,850
but because the males
are bigger and stronger,

432
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,450
they risk serious injury in doing so.

433
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,650
Luckily, this female will be accepted.

434
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,850
Soon the couple will mate,

435
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,450
and she will raise a family of her own.

436
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,450
With tiger snakes,

437
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,850
it's the male that courts the female,

438
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,050
and this male has mating in mind.

439
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,250
The snakes are immune to their own venom,

440
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,150
but rejection could still
result in a vicious fight.

441
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,650
The male carefully aligns
his lower body with hers.

442
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,950
If mating is successful,

443
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,250
the female will store his sperm over winter

444
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,150
to delay fertilization.

445
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,250
This means her young will be born in spring

446
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,750
when food is more plentiful.

447
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,950
As autumn progresses,

448
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,550
mountain clouds thicken

449
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,050
and head down towards the forest.

450
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,650
Temperatures in the valleys drop

451
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,750
and the fog returns.

452
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,550
The animals in the rainforest

453
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,650
begin to prepare for the
cold winter months ahead.

454
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,550
A platypus searches for a meal.

455
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,050
This mammal forages 12 hours day,

456
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,550
diving underwater

457
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,550
with its eyes, ears, and nostrils closed.

458
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,250
Closely related to the echidna,

459
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,050
the platypus has a highly
sensitive duck-like bill

460
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,450
that it uses to seek out prey.

461
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,250
But the platypus is not the only unusual animal

462
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,450
to lurk in Tasmania's streams.

463
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,150
Autumn is mating time for giant crayfish,

464
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,450
and the male must emerge from the water

465
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,550
to defend its territory against rival males.

466
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,550
At one metre long,

467
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,050
the giant crayfish is the world's
largest freshwater invertebrate.

468
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,250
The stand-off is mainly bluff,

469
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,250
and fights to the death are rare.

470
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,950
Most will live to be 60 years old.

471
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,850
The giant crayfish is only found

472
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,650
in the freshwater streams of northern Tasmania.

473
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,950
For this primeval animal,

474
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,850
Tasmania is definitely an Eden.

475
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,950
Nearby, the young female devil
attempts to cross a river.

476
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,750
Now a year old,

477
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,950
she and her three brothers have parted ways

478
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,050
and must fend for themselves.

479
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,350
This young pademelon
is also now independent,

480
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,150
but it is still vulnerable.

481
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,250
Fortunately, the Tasmanian devil
is looking for a mate,

482
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,750
not a meal.

483
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,650
She follows the scent trail of a nearby male.

484
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,750
He is wary of her approach,

485
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,250
and with good reason

486
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,050
courtship between devils

487
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,850
takes the form of ritualized combat.

488
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,050
The intense courtship lasts several days,

489
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,550
then she will fight him off.

490
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,150
The female devil has proved
she is a survivor.

491
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,650
Soon, she'll be the mother
of a family of her own.

492
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,850
As winter sets in once more,

493
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,050
the cold, roaring winds return.

494
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,550
But the creatures that live here

495

- Tasmania.
