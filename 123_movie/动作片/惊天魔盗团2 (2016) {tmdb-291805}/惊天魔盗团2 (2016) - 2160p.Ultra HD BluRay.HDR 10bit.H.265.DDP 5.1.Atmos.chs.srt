你没死啊？你还活着？

01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:31,820
见过这些人吗？

40
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:36,200
我的孙儿跟他们的头说了话

41
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,800
他在里边 跟我来

42
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:48,880

01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:55,260

00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,900
不好意思 对不起
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

59
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,240
对不起
I'm sorry.

60
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,030

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,870
新泽西 一九八四年
今晚 魔术师莱昂内尔·伯劳
Tonight, so-called magician Lionel shrike

62
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,380
将通过表演他所说的“不可能的表演”
is making another sad attempt for attention

63
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,920
再次吸引观众们的目光
by performing what he calls an impossible feat.

64
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,250
保险箱是由最坚固的铁打造
The safe is made of the strongest iron.

65
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,430
无法被锯断 也不能烧穿
It can't be sawed through or pried.

66
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,930
但莱昂内尔·伯劳依然认为自己能逃脱
Yet, Lionel shrike thinks he's able to escape.

67
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,890
爸爸 爸爸
Dad! Dad!

68
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,600
嘿 伙计
Hey, buddy.

69
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,480
你来了
You made it, huh?

70
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,060
看到那边的座位了吗
Now, see that seat there?

71
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,950
难道莱昂内尔·伯劳真的能从 这些束缚中脱身？
Is Lionel shrike the kind of magician who can pull this off?

72
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,950
或是他只是太狂妄自大了？
Or is he actually in over his head?

73
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,450
我们拭目以待
We'll see about that.

74
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,620
怎么了
What's the matter?

75
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,990
我不想让你去
I don't want you to go.

76
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,210
迪连 好了 我们说过的
Dylan, come on. We talked about this.

77
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,500
记得吗？这是我的工作
Remember? This is what I do.

78
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,170
我要证明那些喷子是错的
I got to prove all those naysayers wrong.

79
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,080
好吗？而且…
Okay? Besides...

80
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,180
我每次都会在袖子里藏一手
I always keep something up my sleeve.

81
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,300
好 跟爸爸对表？
Now, got your watch like your dad's?

82
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,970
多少秒？
Okay. How many seconds?

83
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,430
三百秒
300.

84
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,090
三百秒 可能还要快一些
300. Maybe a few less.

85
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,150
嗯
Mmm.

86
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,940
我爱你
I love you so much.

87
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,480
好 再见 大小伙
Okay. See you later, big man.

88
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,280
女士们先生们 有请莱昂内尔·伯劳
- Ladies and gentlemen, - Lionel shrike!

89
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,910
他能够摈住呼吸吗
Will he be able to hold his breath?

90
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,540
他能逃出保险箱吗？
Will he be able to somehow escape the safe?

91
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,290
三 二 一…
Three, two, one...

92
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,180
二、三…
Two, three,

93
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,680
四 五 六 七 八…
four, five, six, seven, eight...

94
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,690
两百九十六…
296...

95
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,980
两百九十七 两百九十八 两百九十九 三百
297, 298, 299, 300

96
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,030
三百零三 三百零四…
303,304...

97
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,110
已经五分钟了
It's five minutes now,

98
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,160
我们还是没有看到或是听到 任何来自莱昂内尔·伯劳的动静
and we have not seen or heard anything from Lionel shrike yet.

99
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,370
让开
Move!

100
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,710
爸爸
Dad!

101
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,540
爸爸 爸爸
Dad! Dad!

102
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,970
放开我
Let go of me!

103
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,010
爸爸
Dad!

104
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,260
不 爸爸
No! Dad!

105
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,180
爸爸 放开我
Dad! Let go!

106
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,480
找到他
Find him!

107
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,000
眼睛
The eye.

108
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,580
也许不会说谎
It may not lie...

109
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,260
但别以为它不能被谎言蒙蔽
But don't think for a moment that it can't be lied to.

110
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,760
所见即所信
Seeing is believing.

111
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,760
但那是真相吗？
But is it truth?

112
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,220
人们把骑士当做高贵的罗宾汉
People see the horsemen as noble Robin hoods.

113
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,390
他们是吗？
Are they?

114
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,600
还是他们只是普通的贼？
Or are they common thieves?

115
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,100
这要看你从哪个角度去看
Depends on your point of view.

116
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,440
你只知道 他们从拉斯维加斯的舞台上 抢劫了一家位于巴黎的银行
They robbed a bank in Paris from a stage in las Vegas.

117
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,150
他们从一个保险巨头身上
They fleeced an insurance magnate

118
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,690
卷走了数亿美元
of hundreds of millions of dollars

119
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,440
然后在纽约的一个屋顶上消失了
and disappeared from a roof in New York.

120
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,660
总是让最忠诚的支持者 沐浴在金钱之中
Always showering their devoted fans with money.

121
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,620
接下来是你不知道的
Here's what you don't know.

122
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,790
他们留下了一个人
They left one man behind.

123
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,740
他被关了起来 替他们背黑锅
Framed. Holding the bag.

124
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,630
我
Me.

125
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,380
（塔迪乌斯·布莱德利）
你在听吗 骑士
Are you listening, horsemen?

126
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,590
当你出现 你会来的
When you emerge, and you will...

127
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,680
我会等着你
I will be there waiting.

128
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,140
因为记住我的话
Because mark my words,

129
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,140
你会遭到报应的
you will get what's coming to you.

130
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,510
以你想象不到的方式
In ways you can't expect.

131
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,150
但绝对是你应得的
But very much deserve.

132
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,150
因为我相信一件事
Because one thing I believe in

133
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,440
以眼还眼
is any eye for an eye.

134
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,600
欢迎 丹尼尔·阿特拉斯
Welcome, Daniel atlas.

135
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,910
哪位？
Who am I speaking to?

136
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,450
我想看看这一切的幕后主使
I asked to see the face behind all of this.

137
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,570
你问了很多问题
You've asked many questions.

138
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,170
提出了很多抱怨
And registered many complaints.

139
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,250
放心 我们都听到了
You can rest assured that we've heard you.

140
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,750
有吗？因为我不…
Have you? Because I don't...

141
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,250
- 不相信？ - 不
- Trust?  - No.

142
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,920
你的领导？你手下的骑士？
Your leader? Your fellow horsemen?

143
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,590
我不喜欢我们已经隐姓埋名 生活一年的现状
I don't like that we've been living in hiding for a year.

144
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,800
我不喜欢每次听到迪连的消息 内容都是
I don't like that every message i get from Dylan is,

145
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,340
等待 要耐心
"wait. Be patient.

146
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,590
天眼有计划
"The eye has a plan."

147
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,940
等待 要耐心
Wait. Be patient.

148
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,390
天眼有计划
The eye has a plan.

149
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,440
这是个游戏 我不想玩了
This is games and it's not working for me.

150
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,940
你觉得应该是你来带领骑士们
You feel it is you who should be leading the horsemen,

151
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,450
而不是迪连

相信你独特的能力
Trust that your unique talents

155
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,870
伟大的思想不会被埋没

156
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,620
我们有个新任务给骑士们
We have a new mission for the horsemen.

157
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,750
迪连有个计划 而且很快就会召唤你

158
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,590
现在离开这
Now leave!

162

Just real quick. Can I have you for a couple of minutes?

164
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,690
我正在忙 迪连
I'm right in the middle of something, Dylan.

165
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,650
我知道 没事的 嘿 大伙儿 抱歉
No, I know. It's okay. Hey. Hey, everybody. Sorry.

抱歉打扰了
Sorry about that.

167
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,290
打电话给市长
Call the mayor.

168
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,660
非常感谢 双胞胎？不错
Thanks a lot. Twins, huh? Good.

169
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,870
他也来吗
Is he coming?

170
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,000
要不是非常重要的事
Look, I wouldn't have brought you out of that meeting

171
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,670
我也不会打断你的会议
unless it was something important.

172
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,010
是关于骑士的
It's about the horsemen.

173
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,380
这里有事情发生了 而且现在正在发生
Something's happening here and it's happening now.

174
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,010
留言板 精英魔术社会

里面有关于骑士的讨论
There is chatter going on about the horsemen

176
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,470
奥克塔出事了 它可是软件巨头
and something happening with octa, the giant software company.

177
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,970
我知道奥克塔是什么
I know what octa is.

178
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,810
对不起 女士 但两个月前
I'm sorry, ma'am, but two months ago

179
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,310
我们派人去费城了 就因为他自以为知道…
we sent men to Philadelphia because he knew...

180
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,400
我说了那次我错了
And I said that I was wrong.

181
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,030
他知道骑士
He knew that the horsemen

182
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,030
会攻击欧洲大西洋银行峰会
were going to hit the euro-Atlantic banking summit.

183
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,320
我有证据
I have proof.

184
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,690
- 让他说完  - 谢谢
- Let him talk.  - Thank you.

交流
Communications.

186
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,370
我认为其中一方是丹尼尔·阿特拉斯
Contact between who I think might be Daniel atlas

187
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,990
另一方很可能是梅里特·麦金尼
and who may be merritt mckinney.

188
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,040
你有什么证据？电子邮件？手机？
And what do you have? Emails? Cell phones?

189
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,540
有手稿吗？
Any transcripts?

190
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,700
- 鸽子  - 什么？
- Pigeons.  - What?

191
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,050
对不起 你是说鸽子密探？
I'm sorry, you mean stool pigeons?

192
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,800
不 我说的就是鸽子 真正的鸽子 就像信鸽那样
No, I mean actual pigeon pigeons. Like carrier pigeons.

193
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,380
好吗？魔术师变戏法
Okay? Magicians work

194
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,840
- 都用的信鸽  - 白鸽
- with pigeons.  - Doves.

195
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,470
听我说
Stay with me.

196
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,680
这里有只鸽子
This pigeon, right here...

197
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,430
这是丹尼尔·阿特拉斯 同一只鸽子
There's Daniel atlas. Same pigeon.

198
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,560
东村
East village.

199
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,310
同样的鸽子 西村
Same pigeon, west village.

200
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,980
四十二大街 鸽子 六十五大街
42nd street, pigeon. 65th street.

201
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,940
一直到乔治·华盛顿大桥
All the way up to the George Washington bridge

202
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,480
跟一个和梅里特·麦金尼
on a sail boat with a guy

203
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,690
长得一模一样的人
that looks just like merritt mckinney.

204
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,080
这一切有什么含义？
And what does this all mean?

205
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,410
我知道那意思是什么
I know what it means.

206
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,700
没有任何含义 都是瞎扯
It means nothing. It's bullshit.

207
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,530
- 你能换个调调吗  - 不行
- Could you sing a new song?  - No.

208
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,580
那次呢 两年前你差点…
How is it that two years ago you were so close...

209
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,090
你认为我独自行动就是为了 毁掉我自己的调查吗
You think I went out of my way to screw up my own investigation?

210
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:06,380
我知道你在想什么 你自以为很聪明 但其他所有人都认为你是蠢货
But you want everybody else to think that you're an idiot.

211
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,420
好了 住口
Okay, stop.

212
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,500
考恩 虽然我是新来的 但我看得出来
Cowan, I know I'm new here, but as far as I can tell,

213
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,800
连根本不认识你的人都觉得 你是个混球
people who don't even know you, think you're an asshole.

214
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,800
还有你 你不认识我 但我在 警校的第一年
You don't know me, but my first year in the academy,

215
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,100
你来发表过讲话
you gave a talk.

216
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,930
你管那叫“长期较量”
The "long game" you called it.

217
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,730
你提到了道德指南针
You talked about a moral compass.

218
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,940
说你相信自己的道德准则永远不会改变
About how you believed in yours immutably.

219
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,110
我当时心想 那个人
And I thought to myself, "that guy.

220
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,070
总有一天 我要跟他一样
"One day, i want to be that guy."

221
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,410
可现在 一只鸽子？
And now... a pigeon?

222
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,620
严格来说是几只鸽子 但我明白你的意思
Technically, it was a few pigeons, but I hear what you're saying.

223
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,130
好吧 我就这么办
Okay. So here's what I'm going to do.

224
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,710
你想休假一天吗？
You want to take a vacation day?

225
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,670
但我不会再在虚无缥缈的线索上 投入我的资源
But I'm not going to devote resources to another snipe hunt.

226
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,830
我是来清理烂摊子 不是来添乱的 非常抱歉
I came to clean this mess up, not add to it. I'm sorry.

227
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,970
老板 谢谢
Boss, thank you.

228
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,510
我保证 这绝不是虚无缥缈的
I promise you, it won't be a snipe hunt.

229
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,890
我们会抓住那些骑士的
We're gonna get those horsemen.

230
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,010
她人真好
She's great.

231
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,800
问题是
The problem is

232
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,440
两个和尚挑水
when you're two people at the same time,

233
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,850
谁都喝不上
one of them is bound to trip the other.

234
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,520
等你喝不上水的时候
And when that happens,

235
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,150
我会在一旁鼓掌
I will be there.

236
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,980
牢记在心
Duly noted.

237
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,010
- 噢 嗨  - 你是谁
- Oh. Hi!  - Who are you?

238
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,840
- 你在我家干什么  - 说起来挺有趣的
- What are you doing in my...  - It's actually a funny story.

239
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,550
你是怎么进来的？
How did you get into my apartment? Whoa!

240
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,840
我觉得挺有趣 但其实不是 让人“哈哈”的那种有趣
I think it's funny. It's not like funny "ha ha."

241
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,010
也不是你想象的那种“哈哈”的有趣
Or you might not think that it's funny "ha ha."

242
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,520
我觉得有趣 因为我觉得 这一切都是相关的
I think it's funny. I guess it's all kind of relative.

243
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
我其实…不 不是…
I was actually... No, that's not...

244
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,730
我先搬到附近住 现在到了这里
I made myself in the neighborhood and now I'm here,

245
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,020
也许…
and maybe...

246
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,030
好吧
Okay.

247
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,860
说真的 你是怎么进来的
Seriously, how did you get in here?

248
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,860
你是疯狂的粉丝吗
Are you some kind of crazed fan or something?

249
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,860
天啊 不不 我认识你
Oh, my god. No, no, no, i recognize you.

250
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,610
你表演了那个B级的
You did that b-grade

251
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,030
极客魔术对吗 你从…
"geek magic" thing, didn't you? You pulled a...

252
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,210
从兔子里拉出一顶帽子
Pulled a hat out of the rabbit.

253
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,620
从兔子身上拉出帽子 没错
A hat out of the rabbit, that's right.

254
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,790
我知道那样不能成功
I know that it didn't work.

255
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,910
不 那太恶心了
No, it was actually kind of disgusting.

256
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,870
- 但兔子不介意  - 你的破绽明显 身体脆弱
Well, your drop was obvious and your body shell is flimsy.

257
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,130
所以如果你不介意的话
So if you wouldn't mind

258
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,470
从我沙发下面爬出来
crawling out from under my couch and...

259
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,720
嗒嗒 我现在坐在这咯 疯啦！
Ta-da! Now I'm sitting over here. Crazy!

260
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,680
顺便说一句 那个兔子戏法？
By the way, that rabbit thing?

261
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,520
那都是八年前了好吗
That was eight years ago, okay?

262
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,140
我这几年进步了很多
I've gotten so much better since then.

263
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,890
- 有吗  - 对
- Have you?  - Yeah.

264
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,140
好吧 过来 你想要做什么
Okay, come here. What is it that you want?

265
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,850
我想见你 当然人人都想
I wanted to meet you. Everybody, really.

266
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,690
我想成为“眼”的一员 好吗
I want to be a part of the eye, okay?

267
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,740
真的 而且我想用我的魔术做好事
I said it. I do. And I want to use my magic for good,

268
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,070
就好像你和梅里特 特别是杰克
like you and merritt and Jack especially.

269
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,150
没错 我知道那个杰克还活着
Oh, that's right. I know that Jack is alive.

270
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,620
我知道他伪装了自己的死亡
I know that he faked his own death.

271
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,950
我超喜欢假死
I am a huge fan of faking deaths.

272
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,580
太疯狂了
That was crazy!

273
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,080
这是什么？车夫结？
What is this? A trucker's hitch?

274
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,950
- 对  - 打的太差劲了
- Yeah.  - It's terrible.

275
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,080
- 真丢脸  - 好吧
- Embarrassing.  - Okay.

276
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,130
还有 真遗憾亨利离开你了
By the way, i am so sorry that henley left you.

277
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,050
- 噢 天啊  - 对不起
- Ow! God!  - Sorry.

278
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,550
那样其实更好点
That's actually a little better.

279
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,710
知道我听说什么了吗
You know what I heard?

280
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,600
关于亨利？我听说 她厌倦了等待
I heard that she got tired of waiting around.

281
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,060
她失去了信仰要求退出
She lost faith and so she asked for an out,

282
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,020
天眼就满足了她
and the eye gave it to her.

283
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,270
但谁知道呢 对吧
But who knows, right?

284
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,520
内心想法这东西很难说
In matters of the heart, so difficult to tell.

285
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,770
也许她只是厌倦你了
I mean, maybe she got sick of you.

286
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,940
有想过那种可能吗？
You ever think about that?

287
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,150
可能你把她绑得不够紧 噢
Maybe you just didn't tie her up tight enough. Ow!

288
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,730
嗯 接下来会这样
Mmm. Here's what's going to happen.

289
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,030
你要呆在这里 闭上嘴
You're going to stay here and stop talking,

290
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,650
我要打个电话
and I'm going to make a phone call,

291
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,990
在五分钟之内会有人…
and in about five minutes, some people are going...

292
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,750
- 发力都在手腕上  - 嗯哼
- It's all in the wrist.  - Uh-huh.

293
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,840
让卡片的冲力替你完成工作
Let the momentum of the card do the work for you.

294
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,000
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

295
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,960
最后这一张我叫做“旋转”
This last one i call the stall.

296
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,260
不错
Not bad.

297
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,970
现在想看个美妙的东西吗
Now you want to see a thing of beauty?

298
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,810
想啊 来吧
I do indeed. Here you go.

299
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,060
噼里啪啦砰
And bingo bango bongo.

300
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,820
不不 挺好的 虽然
No, no, no, it's good to be positive

301
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,320
这一年毫无进展
despite making zero progress in a year.

302
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,610
是啊
Yeah.

303
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,610
但在催眠术方面
Whereas when it comes to hypnotism,

304
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,940
学生几乎就要出师了
the student has almost become the master.

305
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,160
我喜欢你的自信
I like your confidence,

306
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,700
但你可以说你有更好的老师
but you might say that you have the better teacher.

307
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,830
- 噢  - 对
- Ooh!  - Yeah.

308
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,330
你说得对 你的老师绝对不知道 自己在干什么
Your teacher definitely doesn't know what he's doing.

309
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,340
顺便 这是你昨天的卡牌吗
By the way, was this your card yesterday?

310
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,670
没错
In fact it was.

311
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,880
我想也是
I thought so.

312
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,630
还不赖
That's not bad.

313
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,010
如果我能在你用卡牌 打中丹尼之前催眠他
If I can hypnotize Danny before you hit him with a card,

314
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,350
就让我睡一星期上铺
I get top bunk for a week.

315
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,350
成交
Okay, that's a deal.

316
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,010
盯着你的手掌 当你的眼神失去焦点
Stare at the palm of your hand and as your eyes change focus,

317
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,310
你会开始意识到…
you will begin to notice...

318
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,690
随你怎么说  这又不是催眠 对我不起作用的 求你别变得跟他一样
It's not working. Please don't become him.

319
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,270
我不知道你们在没有女人的时候
I didn't know you guys did party tricks

320
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,060
居然会耍派对上取乐的这些小花招
when there weren't floozies around to impress.

321
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,370
我们在大概一九三七年的时候就不再…
Uh, I think we stopped trying to impress floozies

322
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,740
以让女人动心为目标了
in, like, 1937.

323
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,870
好吧 有人闯进了我的公寓
Okay, somebody broke into my apartment, all right?

324
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,700
那菜鸟了解我的一切
Some amateur who knew everything about me,

325
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,990
了解亨利离开的一切
everything about henley leaving,

326
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,200
还有我们的一切
and everything about us.

327
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,330
就是她
That's her.

328
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,040
嘿
Hey!

329
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,170
嗨
Hi.

330
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,290
你见过鲁拉了
You met lula.

331
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,960
见过了 她在这干什么
I've met her. What is she doing here?

332
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,880
我是新骑士
I'm the new horseman!

333
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,010
女骑士
I'm the girl horseman.

334
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,720
喔
Whoo!

335
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,890
耶
Yeah!

336
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,050
没人激动吗
Nobody. No excitement.

337
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,390
杰克？不表示下？
Jack? Anything?

338
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,400
迪连 告诉我这里是什么情况
Dylan, tell me what's going on here.

339
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,150
鲁拉过去十年都在做地下工作
Well, lula's been on the underground scene for the last decade,

340
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,900
我觉得她是有真才实学的
and I think she has some real talent,

341
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,980
我想让她走上台前
and I'd like to try her on stage

342
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,160
- 来平衡一下阳盛阴衰  - 什么？
- to balance out the duo.  - What?

343
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,110
你是认真的吗？
No, are you serious, man?

344
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,740
亨利离开后你说过 我可以再回到台上的
After henley left, you said I could get back on stage again.

345
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,110
现在怎么就凭空冒出来个人
Not someone who just showed up.

346
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,290
我考虑过 真的 但我真的需要你 再跟我一起在幕后多呆一会
And I really need you behind the scenes with me for a little while longer.

347
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,710
迪连 好了 我这辈子都在幕后啊
Dylan, come on. I've been behind the scenes my whole life.

348
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,210
补充一句 那可是犯罪 你看到那人的脸了吗
Which is a crime, might I add. Have you seen that man's face?

349
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,300
我非常感谢你为团队加入了女性
The addition of some femininity to the group,

350
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,760
这已经比阿特拉斯所提供的条件 要好很多了
over and above what atlas provides...

351
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,090
我觉得我们在这里真正的问题是…
I think the real issue is we've been in this...

352
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,430
真正的问题是我们已经排练几个月了
Yeah, the issue is that we have been rehearsing for months

353
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,270
排练一个我们都不知道是什么的东西
for something... We don't even know what it is.

354
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,350
如果你继续努力直到…
And you're going to keep working until...

355
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,440
直到我们融合得像一个人一样
Until we work as a single organism.

356
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,730
我知道 我听你说过
I know, I've heard you say that.

357
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,730
我觉得你说的时候指的是我们而不是你
I think what you're referring to is us, not you.

358
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,030
听着 我是直接从天眼那里得到命令的
Listen, I'm getting my orders directly from the eye.

359
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,700
好吗？然后我把命令转达给你们
Okay? And then i give them to you.

360
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,110
要是你不喜欢 你可以走
Now, if you don't like that, you're welcome to go.

361
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,400
不 我哪都不去 但我…
No, I'm not going anywhere. But I'm... mmm.

362
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,280
伙计们 我能简短的插一句吗
Guys, can i just weigh in here really quickly?

363
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,950
因为我想我知道这里究竟怎么回事了
Because I think I see what's going on here.

364
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,870
你们是个了不起的 亲如一家的团体
You guys are this amazing, tight-knit family unit.

365
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,210
- 而我是新来的…  - 说我们是什么都行 但我们不是家人
- I'm a new person...  - We are anything but a family.

366
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,160
好吧 我母亲
Okay, well, my mother

367
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,290
有一次还拿刀顶着我爸的脖子
literally knifed my father in the neck one time.

368
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,340
所以其实你们挺像我家人的
So you are actually a little bit like my family unit.

369
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,800
- 真的？ - 但是 没错
- Literally?  - But, yeah.

370
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
我想那是个意外
It was an accident, i think.

371
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,920
好吧 那这意味着我们真的 要做点什么了？
Okay. So, does this mean we're actually going to do something?

372
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,050
对
Yes.

373
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,480
你们都听说过奥克塔和他们的 花花公子CEO 欧文·凯斯
You've all heard of octa and their playboy ceo, Owen case.

374
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,140
他的搭档 沃尔特·马布里一年前去世了
His partner, Walter mabry, died about a year ago.

375
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,480
想不想知道这一切会带来什么？
You wanna know what all this has been leading to?

376
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,150
奥克塔将发布下一代手机
Octa's hosting the launch of the next-gen cell phone.

377
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,110
只要这些手机走上街头
Once these phones hit the streets,

378
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,030
就会把使用者的信息发给黑市
they'll siphon their users' information to the black market.

379
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,820
这意味着奥克塔将出卖用户隐私 来增加自己的利润
Meaning octa's selling privacy to up their profit.

380
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,830
所以天眼决定揭露他们的阴谋
So, the eye has decided to expose them for it.

381
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,000
我们的目的就是劫持他们的发布会
Our mission is to hijack the show.

382
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,830
排练结束了 伙计们
Rehearsal's over, guys.

383
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,410
这是我们一直等待的机会
This is what we've been waiting for.

384
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,010
是时候让计划成真了
Now it's time to get to work.

385
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,850
欢迎 奥克塔开发者 博客作者 以及记者们
Welcome, octa insiders,

今天标志着社会网络
Today marks the beginning

388
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,430

00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:32,540

Can't have you texting, tweeting, recording, or eating.

393
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,290
对不起 我们会替你保管好它的
Sorry, we will take very good care of it for you.

394
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,120
噢 顺便
Oh, by the way.

395
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,910
凯斯先生亲自写的安保备忘录
Security memo from case himself.

396
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,380
要是有客人给你惊喜 就按照他的指示做 好吗
Couple of surprise guests. Just follow his lead, yeah?

397
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,380
一切都好 我正前往控制室
We're all good. I'm heading to the control room.

398
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,050
好 谢谢 杰克
All right. Thanks, Jack.

399
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,380
阿特拉斯 走
Atlas, go.

400
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,420
不 迪连 我不能…
No, Dylan, I can't...

401
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,810
什么？出什么问题了？
What? What's the problem?

402
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,890
不 人太多了
No, there's too many people...

403
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,220
阿特拉斯 现在欧文降落了
Atlas, I got Owen landing now.

404
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,850
好的 现在就去

406

- 好了  - 谢谢
- Okay.  - Thanks.

407
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,400
帕斯卡 厨房需要你
Pascal, we need you in the kitchen.

408
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,250
听着 演讲的主题是自由好吗
Look, the speech is about freedom, okay?

409
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,040
我们像在这推销的是自由
That's what we're trying to sell here, is freedom.

410
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,460
你到底是哪里搞不懂
Which part of that do you not understand?

411
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,840
- 我的天啊  - 我知道 对不起
- For goodness sake!  - I know, I'm sorry.

412

416
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,060

- Hey there, buddy! - Smile!

417
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,400
- 你是谁？搞什么啊  - 我是谁？
- Who are you? What the hell?  - Who am I?

453
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,520
“克拉克是谁” 真有意思
"Who's Clark?" That's funny.

要是我跟罗杰那么说 他会吓坏的

罗杰又是谁啊
Who the hell is Roger?

457
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,030
莉莎知不知道你不认识罗杰？
Does Lisa know that you don't know Roger?

458
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,700
- 我不知道丽莎是谁  - 你又在开玩笑？
- I don't know who Lisa is.  - Are you kidding again?

- 你现在又不认识丽莎了？ - 不认识 让开
- You don't know who Lisa is now?  - No, I don't. Just get away.

噢 天啊
Oh, my god!

465
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
你对我做了什么
What are you doing to me?

466
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,220
- 救命  - 去帮她
- Help me!  - Help her. Go!

467
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,170
喝点水
Have some water.

468
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,010
从你的表情我看出来你被血吓到了
I feel from your face you're freaked by the flow of blood,

469
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,550
这些都是非常正常的
which is fully fixable in a snap

470
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,230
只要专注 跟着我说的话漂流
by focusing and following the flow of my words

471
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,560
就像你在漂流
as you're flowing and floating,

472
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,560
所以你要专注于我的命令
which is why you're focusing on my commands.

473
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,110
你生活中到目前为止的成就
You got this far in life

474
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,690
都是靠听那一个声音 你脑中的声音
by listening to one voice, the voice in your head.

475
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,650
而这就是那个声音
This is that voice.

476
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,570
看着光
Look at the light.

477
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,540
倾听你自己的声音
Listen to your own voice.

478
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,410
天啊
Oh, my god.

00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,170

你教会了我我不适合这种工作
You have taught me that I'm not cut out for this kind of work.

I'm actually nervous, and I'm not even going onstage.

491
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,120
我听说如果你紧张
You know, I've heard that if you're nervous,

492
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,090
想象对方的裸体会对你有帮助
it can be really helpful to picture each other naked.

493
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,750
其实是想象观众是裸体的
It's actually picture the audience naked.

494
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,630
不 这是新的办法 新的科学
No, this is new. This is a new science.

495
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,170
我不知道
So, I don't know.

496
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,460
你要不要…我们该试试
Do you want... We should try it.

497
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,380
现在没心情
Not the right mood.

498
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,100
看来只能靠我们了 老伙计

499
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,180
什么？想象对方…不不 谢谢
What? Picture each other... No. No, thank you.

I mean, I admit, from the neck up there are issues.

501
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,190

早上好 奥克塔精英们

505
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,490
现在 我宣布过奥克塔八代是绝对的魔法
Now, I've made the claim that octa 8 is pure magic.

506
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,580
但事实是 那只是那种
But the truth is, that's just one of those things I say...

507
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,160
我说是真相 但其实
That's just one of those things I say...

508
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,840
另有含义的东西
...when in fact i mean something else.

509
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,710
但其实是
...when in fact

510
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,670
另有含义的东西
I mean something else.

511
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:43,100
在这里 我将为你们展示

515
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,110
来这里揭露我的骗术
Here to expose me for the fraud I truly am.

516
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,310
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

517
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,440
有请四骑士

我们想聊聊你们的隐私
We want to talk to you about your privacy.

526
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,400
隐私对你们来说有什么意义？
What does your privacy mean to you?

527
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,900
很明显对欧文·凯斯来说 隐私毫无意义
Because apparently to Owen case, it means absolutely nothing.

528
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,740
不 其实比没意义还更没意义
No, actually it means less than absolutely nothing.

529
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,020
看 他嘲弄你们的隐私 他蔑视隐私
You see, he's mocked your privacy.

530
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,910
对 而且我们说的不只是那些
Right, and we're not just talking about the things that you already agreed to

531
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,360
当你看都不看就签下
when you signed, probably without reading

奥克塔客户条款第一款第七条时 所许可的那些

别说
Don't.

539
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,690
伙计们 听我说 我们得绕一下 从后面进去
Guys, look. We got to move around, get in through the back.

540
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,350
这些骑士很狡猾 好吗
These horsemen are tricky, okay?

541
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,560
他们的后备计划都有后备计划
They got backup plans on top of backup plans.

542
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,690
对不起 不是故意幸灾乐祸的 不过我跟你说过了
Hey, sorry, don't mean to gloat, but I told you so.

543
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,280
别废话了 一小时前我们接到匿名电话
We got an anonymous phone call an hour ago.

544
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,610
那确认了我一直以来跟她说的一切
Confirms everything I've been telling her.

545
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,900
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

546
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,780
你派特工去底特律和费城 一直在喊 狼来了这样我们就不会派他们来这里
You've been crying wolf so we wouldn't send them here.

547
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,290
老大 拜托
Boss, please.

548
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:38,540
- 继续开门  - 求你跟我说你没信考恩疯狂的幻想
Please tell me that you haven't bought into cowan's crazy, paranoid fantasia.

549
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,920
在节目开始之前我们让欧文同意了 我们自己的一些条款
We had Owen agree to a few terms and conditions of our own.

550
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,970
所以所有我们曾经认为是隐私的东西…
So, everything that he had once considered private...

551
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,670
他认为是真正隐私的…
That he thinks is really private...

552
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:55,730
所有他认为是隐私的东西现在…
Yeah, everything that he once considered private is now...

553
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,810
天啊
Oh, my.

554
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,900
就像骑士们喜欢说的
As the horsemen like to say,

555
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,900
魔术的关键是控制想法
magic is about controlling perception.

556
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,990
你们把他们看作真相的勇士 但他们是吗？
You see them as champions of the truth, but are they?

557
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,000
或者说这也是他们营造的幻觉之一？
Or is that just another one of their illusions?

558
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,660
- 怎么回事 罗兹  - 这简直疯了
- What's going on, rhodes?  - This is crazy.

559
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,290
我们得让所有人到另一个入口
We got to get everyone to the other entrance.

560
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,500
- 我们走 到后面  - 不 你呆在这
- Let's go, to the back.  - No. You stay here.

561
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,300
那么 既然他们这么喜爱秘密
So, since they clearly love secrets...

562
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,800
那就揭露一些他们的秘密好了
Let's reveal some of theirs.

563
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,630
丹尼 各位 离开舞台
Danny, everyone, get off the stage.

564
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,670
撤退
Abort.

565
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,340
杰克 跟他们一起走
Jack, go with them.

566
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,770
记不记得杰克·怀尔德之死？
Do you recall the death of Jack Wilder?

567
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:39,720
如果我跟你们说他其实没死 而且就在这儿会怎么样？
What if I told you he's not just alive, but he's actually right here.

568
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,650
知道还有谁在这吗？
And do you know who else is here?

569
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,280
FBI！
The FBI.

570
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,490
让他们进来吧 好吗
Let's let them in, shall we?

571
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,580
现在 惊天秘密
And now, for the big reveal.

572
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,450
走 上舞台
Go! Move! To the stage.

573
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,490
有第五个骑士
There's a fifth horseman,

574
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,420
而他是他们之中最大的罪犯
and he's the biggest criminal of them all.

575
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,960
FBI特工 迪连 罗兹
FBI agent, Dylan rhodes.

576
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,380
- 我就知道  - 什么？
- I knew it.  - What?

577
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,510
这比你所知道的要深得多 老大
This is so much deeper than you know, boss.

578
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,680
你以为自己看着一样东西
You think you're looking at one thing,

579
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,390
- 但你根本不懂  - 你是谁
- but you have no idea.  - Who are you?

580
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,890
跟我一直以来一样
The same man I've always been.

581
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,970
伙计们 对不起
Boys, I'm sorry.

582
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,440
这是在耍我吧
You gotta be kidding me.

583
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,080
- 走走  - 这些人是谁
- Move! Move!  - Who are those guys?

584
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,490
谁管呢 快走
Who cares? Come on!

585
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,740
- 快 快  - 继续走
- Hurry, hurry!  - Keep going!

586
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,410
这是怎么发生的
How the hell could this happen?

587
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,620
我以为一切都在迪连的掌控之中
I thought Dylan had everything under control.

588
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,450
对 很明显他没掌控
Yeah. Apparently he didn't.

589
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,910
也许是你泄露的 丹
Maybe you're the leak, Dan.

590
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,590
你鬼鬼祟祟的干嘛去了？
Where you been sneaking off to?

591
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,040
你居然敢暗示我…
Don't you dare for a second insinuate that I had...

592
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,630
我没在暗示 那是你…
I'm not insinuating. That's your...

593
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,590
我们上车 快点
Let's get to the truck, come on!

594
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,090
- 一起走  - 走 走
- Stay together!  - Move! Move!

595
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,920
鲁拉 快点
Lula, come on!

596
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,890
来了 喔
Coming! Whoa!

597
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,930
喔 喔 喔
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

598
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,110
睡 睡 睡 睡
Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.

599
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,120
怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

600
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,450
怎么不是车子？
Wasn't there supposed to be a truck?

601
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,620
我们在哪？
Where the hell are we?

602
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,000
走
Come on!

603
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,960
嘿 嘿 你接错管子了吗？
Hey, hey! Wait, did you mis-run the tube?

604
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,790
没 我接到车子里了 我知道我接好了
No, I put it in the truck. I know I did!

605
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,460
因为我们现在真的不是在车上
Because we're really not in the truck right now.

606
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,800
- 我在走 轻点  - 有地方出问题了
- I'm moving! Relax!  - There's something very wrong.

607
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,590
好吧 我们为什么在这？
Okay. Why are we here?

608
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,640
我为什么这么饿
Why am i frickin' starving?

609
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,810
对 我也很饿
Yeah, I'm weirdly starving, too.

610
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,100
这没道理啊
This makes no sense.

611
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,500
好了 对不起
Okay, sorry.

612
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,550
至少 我知道虽然这没法安慰人
At least, and I know this isn't much consolation,

613
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,880
不过很明显现在我们被 中国菜包围了
but apparently we're now surrounded by Chinese food.

614
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,050
对吧？
Right?

615
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:23,640
我觉得我们现在这地方 不能光用“中国菜”来形容
I think where we are right now, they don't refer to it as "Chinese food."

616
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,890
这就叫做
It's just called

617
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,770
“菜”
"food."

618
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,700
等等 你说什么？这怎么可能？
Wait, what are you saying? How is this possible?

619
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,150
我相信用你独特的说法 那个词应该是
I believe in your particular parlance, the word is

620
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,530
“魔术”
"magic."

621
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,080
那家伙跟你长得一样
That guy looks exactly like you.

622
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,160
跟你长得一模一样 你看到了吗
He looks exactly like you. Are you seeing this right now?

623
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,500
沙斯
Chase.

624
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,590
你这表情让我觉得就像听 别人说自己见到滚石乐队
It's like what I heard about meeting the rolling stones.

625
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,550
发现他们真人比相片矮一点
They're a lot shorter in person.

626
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,510
记不记得我跟你们说过有一个 我做什么他都捣乱的人？
Remember I told you about the guy who screwed me out of everything?

627
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,840
这就是我的双胞胎兄弟 沙斯
This is my twin brother, chase.

628
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,600
等等 这是你干的？
Wait, did you do this?

629
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,810
如你们所见
As you can see,

630
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,730
我的老板不喜欢乱来
my boss don't mess around.

631
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,560
我完全不明白现在这是怎么回事
I do not understand what is going on right now. At all.

632
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,690
好吧 让我替你们说明一下
Okay, let me break it down for you.

633
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,740
你们从纽约的一个屋顶跳下来 落到了澳门
You jumped off a rooftop in New York and you landed in Macau.

634
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,860
也叫中国的维加斯
Aka the Vegas of China.

635
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,750
快速转移
And presto-changeo.

636
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,950
你不喜欢吗
Don't you just love it?

637
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,080
“全世界最伟大的魔术师们”
The "greatest magicians in the world"

638
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,750
居然成了别人魔术里面的道具
are the object of someone else's magic trick?

639
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,910
这难道不是很诗意吗
Isn't that poetic?

640
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,590
不觉得？知道吗
No? You know what,

641
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,670
我不会让你们倒我胃口的
I'm not gonna let you guys yuck my yum.

642
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,090
咻咻 还是姆咻 走吧
Shoo-shoo. Or mu-shu. Whatever.

643
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,640
噢 还有知不知道他们说的
Oh, and you know what they say,

644
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,180
“发生在澳门的…”
"what happens in Macau..."

645
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,810
下半句不记得了
Uh, well, I don't know the rest of it,

646
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,640
因为是用中文说的
'cause it's in Chinese, uh...

647
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,270
谢谢 伙计们
Hey, thanks, guys!

648
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,210
有报告称臭名昭著的四骑士
Reports are coming in that the infamous horsemen

649
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,550
劫持了今天的奥克塔新品发布会
hijacked the octa product launch today.

650
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:20,630
我们也知道了杰克·怀尔德 奇迹般的复活
As we learned of the miraculous resurrection of Jack Wilder.

651
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,810
以及FBI特工迪连 罗兹其实是
And the stunning revelation that FBI agent Dylan rhodes

652
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,180
部门里内鬼这一惊人现实
has been working as a mole within the bureau.

653
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,760
今天的问题导致
Questions abound today

654
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,930
全球范围内已经展开迪连 罗兹
as an international manhunt is underway

655
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,570
以及他躲藏起来的 犯罪魔术师团体的抓捕
for Dylan rhodes and his elusive and criminal band of illusionists.

656
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,190
嘿 真的 你们在哪？
Hey, seriously, where are you guys?

657
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,650
我在接头点 还给你们留了言
I'm at the meetup. I've been leaving you messages.

658
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,730
但一点消息都没有
I haven't heard from anyone.

659
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,650
求你们打我电话
Please, call me!

660
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,660
星期四我们有巨大收获 也蒙受了重大损失
Big gains and modest losses on Thursday.

661
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,700
嘿 告诉我你很安全 你在哪
Hey, tell me you're safe. Where are you?

662
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,280
就在你十八个月前丢下我的地方
- Right where you left me. - 18 months ago,

663
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,000
罗兹特工
agent rhodes.

664
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,250
塔迪乌斯？
Thaddeus?

665
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,210
失去一切的感觉如何？
How does it feel to lose everything?

666
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:00,170
你的工作 你的身份 你活下去的理由
Your job. Your identity. Your reason for living.

667
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,600
失去掌控的滋味如何？ 也许这是你第一次尝到？
How does it feel to be out of control, perhaps for the first time?

668
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,180
- 你为谁工作  - 你是个蠢货 罗兹特工 一直都是
- You're a fool, agent rhodes.  - You always have been.

669
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,060
他们在哪？
Where are they?

670
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,190
我不会在电话里告诉你
I'm not telling you on the phone!

671
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:18,360
如果你想知道四骑士最近遭遇的挫折 背后是不是我指使的
And if you're wondering if I was behind the horsemen's recent debacle,

672
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,190
这就交给你自己去调查了
I'll let you work that out for yourself.

673
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,030
嘿 我烧死过你一次 我还会再烧一次的
Hey, I burned you once, I'll burn you again.

674
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,280
我不在玩游戏 塔迪乌斯
I'm not playing, Thaddeus.

675
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,120
这不是我的游戏 罗兹特工 是你的
It's not my game, agent rhodes. It's yours.

676
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,740
当你把我锁进牢房时 你就开始了游戏
You started it when you locked me in a cell.

677
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,370
这一局只是轮到我走而已
This is simply my move.

678
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,380
下一步该你了
Next one is yours.

679
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,130
不
No!

680
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,630
放开
Let go!

681
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,050
爸爸 救命 爸爸
Dad! Help me! Dad!

682
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,300
爸爸
Dad!

683
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,950
关键在于盲点
It's all about blind spots.

684
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,280
当你直接盯着一样东西
When you're staring straight at something,

685
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,910
却看不到它 为什么？
and not see it. Why?

686
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,250
盲点
Blind spots.

687
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,080
这是我们一起学到的 不是吗兄弟
We learned that together. Didn't we, bro?

688
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,420
他有没有跟你们说过 我们曾经是搭档？
Did he tell you that we were partners once?

689
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,830
没有？不会没说过吧 著名的“小麦金尼兄弟”
No? I didn't think so. The "mini-mckinneys."

690
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,220
♪ 切西和梅比
♪ Chasey and a mer-bear

691
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,260
♪ 会让你吓死
♪ gonna make you scare-bear

692
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,800
♪ 魔法麦金尼
♪ ma-ma-magic mckinneys

693
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,880
酷
cool.

694
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,140
然后一天 我们十二岁
And then, one day, we were 12

695
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,440
弗吉尼亚·冯·威尔谢姆
and Virginia Von welsheim

696
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,770
在街头举行了一个很棒的派对
had a very nice party down the street.

697
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,450
我有点情况不能去
I had a little tum-tum, couldn't go.

698
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:49,110
梅比自己去了 尝到了独自表演的甜头
Mer-bear did it on his own, and got a taste of the solo thing,

699
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,750
然后就把我一脚踢开
and kicked me to the curb.

700
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,120
天啊
Oh, god.

701
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,120
沙斯 你赢了 我承认
Chase, you win! I concede.

702
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,300
你是怎么做的 快递员 一个月前来到你家 小萨？
Delivery guy came to your door about a month ago, little za.

703
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,090
萨？
Za?

704
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,130
披萨
Pizza, huh?

705
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,970
这是D三三七五公寓吗
Is this apartment d3375?

706
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,060
完全不是
Not even close.

707
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,770
睡吧
Sleep!

708
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,480
放松 漂浮
Relaxing, floating,

709
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,820
飘荡 入梦
drifting, dreaming...

710
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,150
坠落
Falling.

711
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,440
所以 我的小兄弟
So, what he did, my little womb-mate,

712
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,440
下载了你所有的私人信息
is he downloaded all your private information,

713
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,870
我的老板有了他需要的一切
and my employer had all he needed.

714
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,200
谢谢
Thanks.

715
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,160
你怎么知道怎么找他
How did you know how to find him?

716
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,340
- 真是个好问题 阿特拉斯  - 好吧
- That's a very good question, atlas.  - Okay.

717
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,360
跟着警卫 他们会带你去见我的老板
Just follow the guards. They'll take you to my boss.

718
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,480
跟你玩猫捉老鼠很有意思 兄弟
Been fun playing this cat-and-mouse with you, broski.

719
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,450
喵
Meow.

720
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,950
玩的开心
Have fun at the sands.

721
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,340
真是非常非常对不起
I am so, so, so sorry.

722
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,500
别再说我背叛我们了 好吗
Don't ever accuse me of betraying us again, okay?

723
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,810
你们有没有想过天眼正在看着这一切
Do you guys ever think that the eye is watching this?

724
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,230
也许这就是他们想要的？
You know, that maybe this is even what they want?

725
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,020
在某个瞬间
And at the exact right moment,

726
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,230
他们会突然出现 然后我们会…
they're gonna swoop in, and we'll be like,

727
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,240
“太好了 谢天谢地你来了”
"yes! Thank god you're here!

728
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,830
“谢天谢地 来的刚刚好 天眼”
"Thank god! Just in the Nick of time, eye!"

729
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,490
然后我们会庆祝
And then we'll just celebrate,

730
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,910
到最后一切都是值得的？
and it was all worth it in the end?

731
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,090
其实我也不是那么想的 所以…
I don't even really think that, either, so...

732
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,090
没事
It's cool.

733
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,440
啊
Ah.

734
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,440
嗒嗒
Ta-da!

735
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,190
跟你们合作我太开心了
So happy to be working with you.

736
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,940
请进 请进
Please, come in. Come in.

737
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,120
喔 喔 喔
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

738
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,120
对不起 你是怎么跟我们合作的
Wait, sorry, how are you working with us?

739
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,450
就跟魔术师从帽子里拽出兔子一样
Oh, well, as much as a magician who pulls a rabbit from a hat

740
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,410
要跟那兔子合作
is working with that rabbit.

741
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,940
我们会合作的 没错 我想介绍一下自己…
We'll be working together. Yes.

742
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,000
对 你是沃尔特·马布里 你一年前死了
Yeah, you're Walter mabry. You died a year ago.

743
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,580
对 我这点子是学你的 怀尔德先生
Yes. An idea I got from you, Mr. Wilder.

744
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,580
伪装自己的死 然后世界就会放下防备
Fake your death, the world puts its guard down.

745
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,630
我控制了那么几家公司
I'm able to control quite a few companies,

746
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,970
包括我老搭档欧文的
including my old partner, Owen's,

747
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,470
用的是所谓的匿名持股者组成的财团
as a consortium of so-called anonymous shareholders.

748
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,010
那违反了多少条证监会法律？
And that violates how many sec laws?

749
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,300
应该是每一条都违反了
I believe it breaks all of them.

750
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,890
每一条
All of them.

751
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:04,600
你看 你们都想要观众
You see, you all want an audience.

752
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,900
迫切的需要一个观众
Need one, desperately.

753
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,190
这真的很让人难过
It's quite sad, really.

754
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,310
只是 我虽然有能力抓住你们
Hence, my ability to nab you.

755
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,280
但另一方面 我想要的正好完全相反
I, on the other hand, want the opposite of that.

756
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,910
我只想 而且现在正是
I just want to be, and I am

757
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,610
百分百的在体制之外
100% off the grid.

758
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,160
知道为什么吗？
You know why?

759
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,570
知道 因为体制是为真正的人准备的
Yeah, because the grid is for actual human beings.

760
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,170
不 因为在一个大数据的世界
No, because in a world of total surveillance,

761
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,330
唯一真正的自由只存在于不被看见之中
the only true freedom lies in not being seen.

762
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,580
你不能从体制内控制体制
You can't control the grid from within the grid.

763
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,580
- 跟我来  - 好吧
- Follow me.  - Yeah.

764
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,470
- 跟我来  - 好了好了
- Follow me.  - Okay. All right.

765
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,970
你从兔子身上拽出了一顶帽子 那真是让人眼前一亮
You pulled a hat out of a rabbit. That was very colorful.

766
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,630
那是大概八年半之前了
Almost eight and a half years ago.

767
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,470
所以 不用特意提起
So, no need to bring that up.

768
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,190
毕竟我们不能为青春时期犯下的 所有错误都买单
We can't all be held accountable for our adolescent personas.

769
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,350
对吧 大魔术师？
Can we, magicolio?

770
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,940
那都是十五年前了
Magicolio, that was 15 years ago.

771
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:52,360
别误会了 我喜欢那个 我跟你和 很多其他人一样高中没有过性经历
Like you, and many others who, i suppose, were not getting any sex in high school,

772
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,280
虽然尝试过
I dabbled with it.

773
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,450
但和你们不同 我没法让自己 上升一个层次
But, uh, unlike you, i was able to transition upward

774
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,570
进入真正的魔术领域
towards actual magic.

775
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,280
科学 你们可能都听说过
Science, you may have heard it called.

776
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,620
那么 朋友们 想不想知道 我是怎么把你们弄到这的？
Would you like to know, my friends, just how I got you here?

777
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,040
我们知道你是怎么做的
We know how you did it.

778
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,080
- 你不知道  - 对
- No, you don't.  - Yeah,

779
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,050
你偷了我们节目的文件 然后很明显把我们催眠了
you stole our files for the show, then obviously hypnotized us.

780
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:17,010
- 真的 别说了  - 管道里有连续的声音
The strobe was a combo of binaural beats, as well as...

781
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,340
我说了住嘴
I said stop!

782
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,100
你们可能不觉得有趣 但我觉得
You might not be having fun, but I am.

783
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,180
你这表现方式真独特
You have an unusual way of showing it.

784
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,730
那么
So...

785
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,560
我是怎么做到的
How did I do it?

786
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:33,740
简单 你看魔术师喜欢 控制别人的视角
You see, magicians like to control other people's perceptions.

787
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,400
你们在激动紧张之中
In your heightened state of agitation,

788
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,740
看到了最简单的方法 楼顶 黑色管道
you saw the simplest cues. Black tube, roof.

789
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,360
你一心想着跳下去
And your minds filled in the rest.

790
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,250
但你们原本应该跳进去的那根管子 就在你们右侧二十英尺
But the tube you meant to go down was 20 feet to your right.

791
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,370
来吧 坐下 坐下 不用一直站着
Go on, sit down. There's no one standing in your way.

792
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,500
我不介意站着
Don't mind if I do.

793
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,000
总之 你们进入管道之后 没错 你说得对
Anyway, once in the tube, yes, you're right...

794
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,010
吧啦吧啦 管道里含有
Blah, blah, blah, the strobe contained

795
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,760
螺旋形灯管以及词语“睡吧”
uv letters pulsing the word "sleep."

796
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:00,670
灯光加上声音让你们 很快进入了催眠模式
And that, combined with the sound, put you into an instant Alpha pattern.

797
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,560
睡吧 睡吧
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

798
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,310
在那之后才是真正有趣的部分
And from then on, it really was just fun.

799
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,560
我可以向你们保证
And I can assure you,

800
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,680
你们不知道发生了什么
you don't know what happened.

801
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,570
真吓人
That's really creepy.

802
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,440
非常非常吓人
Really, really creepy.

803
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,530
那不酷
That's not cool.

804
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,240
对 很简单 魔术
Yep, easy stuff, magic,

805
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,040
只要你用心
if you put your mind to it.

806
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,080
好了 够了 那为什么带我们来这
All right, that's enough. So why are we here, then?

807
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,700
除了让我们看到你有多聪明
Besides you getting to show off how adorably clever you are.

808
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,630
就从去年你们盗窃的那个人开始吧
Well, to start with, the man you stole from last year,

809
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,090
我发现我在
turns out I had invested

810
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,460
他的一些公司里投了不少钱
quite a lot of money in some of his companies,

811
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,710
所以你们偷的钱中很大一部分 其实是我的
so a lot of what you stole was, in fact, mine.

812
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,590
好消息是 你们回报我的方式很简单
Good news is, it's very easy for you to pay me back.

813
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,470
我只需要你们的技术
I just need your skills.

814
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,350
欧文和我就像甲壳虫乐队 如果甲壳虫曾经是…
Owen and I were like the Beatles, if the Beatles had been...

815
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,470
艾尔芬？
Elfin?

816
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,810
天才
...geniuses.

817
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,600
甲壳虫乐队当然是天才
Pretty sure the Beatles were geniuses.

818
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,150
就像他们一样 我们有过梦想
And like them, we had a dream.

819
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,570
我们能不能创造真正的 原声的魔法？
Could we create actual, genuine magic?

820
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:02,080
我想你们之中有一人实现了 那个梦想 而那不是你？
And I'm guessing one of you achieved that dream, and it wasn't you?

821
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,240
那只是他希望你这么想
That is what he would like you to think.

822
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,450
我的梦想是优雅和技术的完美结合
Was a perfect blend of elegance and technology.

823
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,750
但欧文希望独吞成果 所以他羞辱我
But Owen wanted it for himself so he humiliated me

824
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,170
把我的私人文件透露给了董事会
by exposing my private files to the board of directors

825
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,590
说服了他们相信我不稳定
and convinced them that I am unstable.

826
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,750
他睡着的时候你有没有给他拍照？
Did you take a picture of him while he was sleeping?

827
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,340
他把我踢出了我自己的公司
He had me kicked out of my own company,

828
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,510
然后独占了一块芯片的设计 那不只是一台计算机的关键
taking credit for a chip that's not just the key to one computer,

829
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,640
而且能控制地球上所有的计算机系统
but every computer system on the planet.

830
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,760
它能解码一切 破解防火墙
It can un-encrypt anything, crack the defense firewall,

831
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,650
操纵市场 监控任何人
manipulate markets, and spy on anyone.

832
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,520
现在它已经被卖给出价更高的买家了
And now it's being sold to the highest bidder.

833
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,230
如果你这么有钱为什么不直接去买
If you're so rich, why don't you just buy it?

834
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,650
然后让他得到钱？
So he gets the money?

835
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,860
还有成功的快乐？不行
And the pleasure? No.

836
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,370
况且如果能让你们为我偷过来 为什么还要去买呢
Why would I buy it when I could have you steal it for me?

837
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,200
它将在明天被展示给一些意向买家
It's being previewed tomorrow to the various suitors,

838
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,700
其中包括你们的目标
which will include your targets,

839
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,380
一个南非黑帮带领的团队
a crew lead by a south African gangster.

840
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,630
- 南非黑帮吗  - 对 怎么绕过安保是你们的问题
Yes. How your team gets past security, that's up to you.

841
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,630
但只要进去了你们只要 查看并偷走芯片
But once you do, you just need to inspect it and steal it.

842
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,750
来吧 这最适合你们了不是吗
Come on, this is perfect for you, isn't it?

843
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,550
你们是魔术师和窃贼
You're magicians and thieves.

844
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,720
你为什么会认为我们会 考虑这件工作？
What makes you think we would even consider doing this?

845
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,220
等等 我有个理由 是什么来着？噢 对了
Um, oh, wait, I had a reason. What was it? Oh, yes.

846
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,760
你看 在老家你们是通缉犯
You see, back home, you're wanted criminals.

847
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,230
但在这里我控制警察 赌场 媒体
But here, i control the police, the casinos, the media.

848
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,480
我可以给你们全新的生活 不再躲躲藏藏
I can give you a new life, out of hiding.

849
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,850
如果你们不接受 我会杀了你吗
And if you don't, I'll have you killed.

850
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,910
你知道吗
You know what?

851
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,570
我不会为你偷任何东西
I'm not stealing a thing for you.

852
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,410
除非迪连告诉我可以干
Not unless Dylan tells me it's okay.

853
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,570
真的？那迪连到底在哪呢？
Really? Dylan is where, exactly?

854
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,750
对 我同意他说的 所以你可以杀了我们
Yeah, I'm with him. So you can go ahead and kill us

855
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,790
因为我也不会为你偷任何东西
because I'm not gonna steal anything for you either.

856
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,540
看来我们达成一致了 沃尔特
Strikes me that a consensus seems to be forming, Walter,

857
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,250
我们认为你在虚张声势
and we're calling your bluff.

858
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,840
- 实际上 我们干  - 什么
- Actually, we'll do it.  - What?

859
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,720
我们在澳门 全世界最古老的 魔术商店就在这里
We're in Macau. The oldest magic store in the world is here.

860
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,260
我们能拿到需要的东西 然后就干
We'll get the supplies we need, and we'll do it.

861
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,690
谢谢
Thank you.

862
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:57,390
应该会很有趣的 沙斯早上 会带你们去商店
Chase will take you to the magic shop in the morning.

863
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,490
警徽
Badge.

864
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,450
真的？
Really?

865
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,820
谢谢
Thanks.

866
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,910
考恩特工
Agent cowan.

867
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,460
你的身份证
Your ID.

868
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,870
噢对 谢谢
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

869
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,510
看来布拉德利先生还在吃晚饭
It appears Mr. Bradley's still at dinner.

870
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,340
是吗？跟他说休息结束了
Yeah? Tell him recess is over.

871
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,270
什么？
What?

872
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,950
好吧 这一步我走了 他们在哪 我没时间废话
Where are they? I don't have time for bullshit.

873
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,620
多亏了你我有的是时间
Oh, I have all the time in the world, thanks to you.

874
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,380
我还没吃完我的龙虾
And I didn't get to finish my lobster,

875
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,880
这让我很不爽
which makes me very grumpy.

876
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,840
好吧别废话了 你想要什么
Okay, let's cut the crap. What do you want?

877
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,260
可以先从别装得这么强硬开始
You can dispense with the tough guy act to begin with.

878
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,720
你太想装得像了
You're too desperate for it to be believable.

879
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,520
我说了 你想要什么
I said, what do you want?

880
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,850
你用了搜查令里的二一九表格
You used a form 219 warrant

881
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:23,860
来搜查我的房间 找到了 我和四骑士之间的联系
you found a connection between me and the four horsemen.

882
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,980
这意味着
Which means

883
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,570
你可以带我离开这里二十四小时
you can take me out of here on a 24-hour leave.

884
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,860
你要我帮你越狱？
You want me to break you out?

885
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,580
我要你带我出去
I want you to take me out.

886
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,870
你要的就是引渡命令
All you need is an extradition order,

887
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,830
你可以在我的印刷机上找到
which you'll find in that tray by my printer.

888
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:45,000
迪连 我和四骑士的消失 没有任何关系
I had nothing to do with the horsemen's disappearance.

889
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,710
你被引诱进入一个陷阱
You were lured into a trap.

890
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,750
就像桃乐西到达奥兹国时那样
And like Dorothy did when she landed in oz,

891
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,970
你开始意识到
you're beginning to realize

892
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,640
离开的唯一方式
that the only way out

893
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,010
就是传过去
is through.

894
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,640
而只有我可以帮你过去
And I'm the only one who can get you there.

895
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,440
你把这地方弄得这么好
You got this place wired.

896
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,610
不需要我帮忙你都可以离开
You don't need me to get out of here.

897
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,650
这都是为了偿还
This is all about payback.

898
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,980
我相信以眼还眼
I believe in an eye for an eye.

899
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,570
所以你是要出去毁掉我？
So you're out to destroy me?

900
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,080
你日为我还会玩你的小游戏吗
You think I'm still gonna play your little game?

901
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,870
我知道你会的
I know you will.

902
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,910
因为不管你多努力的尝试
Because no matter how hard you try

903
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,910
这一切幕后的罪犯
to find a culprit behind all this,

904
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,490
你都只会怪罪自己
you're going to blame only yourself.

905
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:26,090
在十八个月前将我投进监狱 结束了你的小小复仇之后
When your little vendetta ended with you putting me in jail 18 months ago,

906
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:29,920
你累了 放松了 你不再注意
you got tired, you got sloppy. You stopped paying attention.

907
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,010
那就是你失败的地方
And that's where you lost.

908
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,760
那么
So,

909
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,760
你可以救你自己
you can save yourself,

910
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,770
或者跟我做个交易
or you can make a deal with me,

911
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,940
救出四骑士
and save the four horsemen,

912
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,400
别再浪费我们俩的时间
and stop wasting both of our time.

913
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,950
为这个自恋狂小个子
Steal something

914
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,910
偷一样东西？我不喜欢
for this narcissistic little man boy? I don't like it.

915
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,870
但我更不喜欢你替我们做决定
But what I like less is you deciding for us.

916
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,780
是吗？那你喜欢让我们沦为 魔术界的笑柄
Yeah? Do you like that we're the laughing stocks of the magic world,

917
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,670
以及现实世界的难民？
and the fugitives of the actual world?

918
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,500
沃尔特说得对 我们无处可去
Walter is right. We have nowhere to go.

919
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,790
但我们可以改变这点
But we can fix that.

920
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,040
- 你可以改变这？ - 对
- We can fix it?  - Yeah.

921
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,670
那你现在正式成为团队成员了？
So you're officially part of the team now?

922
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,580
- 你说什么？ - 迪连说我们应该像
- Excuse me?  - I'm sure this is what Dylan

923
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,720
一个有机体一样肯定就是这个意思
meant when he said we should all work as a single organism.

924
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,970
对 那就是迪连告诉他自己 还有我们的童话故事
Yeah, that is a fairytale that Dylan tells himself, and tells us.

925
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,800
听着 就算我们拿到那东西 他也绝不会放我们走
Look, even if we get this stick, he'll never let us go.

926
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,140
我们不能相信沃尔特 好吗
We can't trust Walter, okay?

927
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,940
天眼在澳门有过一段历史
The eye has a history in Macau.

928
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,980
我们只能相信他们
They're the only ones we can trust.

929
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,940
如果能联系上他们
Now, if we can get it to them,

930
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,400
他们就能洗刷我们的名誉 然后让我们离开这
they can clear our names and get us the hell out of here.

931
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,900
这是个馊主意 伙计
It's a bad plan, man.

932
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,070
嘿
Hey.

933
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,450
嗨 你好吗
Hi, how are you?

934
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,540
我们需要一些定制的东西
Um, we need some things custom-made.

935
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,080
实际上明天就要 我们有点赶时间
Actually, by tomorrow. We're kind of in a rush.

936
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,830
然后…
And...

937
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,580
你不知道我在说什么对吗
You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?

938
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,470
欢迎来到翁的商店 我叫李 不是李小龙
Welcome to iong's. My name's li. Not Bruce Lee.

939
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,720
- 什么  - 吓到你了
- What?  - Got you.

940
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,840
- 好吧  - 看
- Okay.  - Look.

941
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,140
噢 现在在我头上了 真有意思
Oh! And now it's by my head. How fun.

942
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,850
- 二十美元  - 二十美元？
- $20.  - $20?

943
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,850
不了 谢谢 我们有点赶时间
No, thank you. We're kind of in a rush.

944
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:13,110
- 十美元  - 呃 不要
- $10.  - Uh, no.

945
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:16,110
好吧 给我们大拇指就行
Okay, all right. Just give us the thumbs. Yeah?

946
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,570
好 多谢 杰克 请拿着这个
Okay. Thanks a lot, Jack. Please take these.

947
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:21,200
我们需要凯普林格撑杆
So, we need a keplinger holdout,

948
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,580
还需要些粗糙液体和真田机关
and we also need roughing fluid, a sanada gimmick,

949
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,460
手套 轨道 不过都要塑料的 如果可以的话
sleeves, tracks. This is all in plastic, though, if you can.

950
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:32,920
- 什么  - 他谁啊
What?

951
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,880
我奶奶想知道为什么是塑料的 塑料的都是便宜货
My grandmother wants to know why plastic? Plastic is cheap.

952
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,230
对不起 我们需要塑料的因为…
Sorry. Yeah, we need plastic because we're...

953
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,890
我们要穿过非常敏感的金属探测器
We're going through a very sensitive metal detector, okay?

954
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,810
所以 塑料 没事 金属…
So plastic, nothing. Metal...

955
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:53,640
- 能探测到  - 傻瓜 在这里…
It detects.

956
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,190
她说什么？
What did she say?

957
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,900
她说就算你说得太慢 还手舞足蹈
She said just because you're talking slowly and moving your hands

958
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,910
她也不能突然就听得懂英语
doesn't mean she can suddenly understand English.

959
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,000
噢对
Oh, yeah.

960
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,790
真对不起 他是种族主义者
So sorry. He's racist.

961
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:11,040
听着 我知道唯一我们都认同的
Listen, I know that the only thing that we agree on

962
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,920
就是我们的父母生的孩子太多了
is that our mom and dad had one too many children.

963
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,090
所以要不要就让孩子们玩去
So why don't we just let the kids play with their toys

964
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,710
我们去喝点东西？
and go get a little drinkey-poo?

965
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,170
如果免费的话 没问题
If it's free, it's me.

966
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,640
太好了
Great.

967
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,060
伙计们 我们马上回来
Guys, we'll be right back.

968
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,850
好了 孩子们 监护人在看着你们
Okay, kiddies, the chaperones are watching you.

969
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,100
别做会让我不高兴的事
Don't do anything i wouldn't enjoy.

970
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:34,230
好 你们俩玩的开心
Okay. Have fun, you two.

971
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,110
嘿
Hey.

972
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,070
能借电话用吗？有件事挺重要的
Can I use your phone? It's kind of important.

973
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,240
没问题
Sure.

974
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,990
- 免费的  - 谢谢
- On the house.  - Thanks.

975
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,240
- 你打电话给谁  - 我要安排转移芯片
I'm arranging to hand over the stick.

976
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,120
我们就是这么联系天眼的？
So that's how we've been contacting the eye?

977
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,580
你一直自己联系？
You've been doing it on your own?

978
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,750
也许
Maybe.

979
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,130
天啊 迪连不会喜欢这样的
Oh, god. Dylan's not gonna like this.

980
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:56,750
我不是很关心迪连喜欢怎么样
I'm not really concerned with what Dylan likes.

981
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,710
- 好吧  - 我这是为了我们
- Okay?  - I'm doing this for us.

982
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,220
这东西怎么回事
What is wrong with this thing?

983
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,600
嘿 轻点 这只是孩子的玩具
Hey, relax, it's just a kid's toy.

984
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,930
对 我也是这么想的
Yeah, that's what I thought.

985
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,260
- 好 让我来  - 噢
- Okay. Let me just...  - Ow!

986
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,890
对不起 天啊
Sorry, sorry. Jesus.

987
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,230
嘿 能开这个吗
Hey, can you get this?

988
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,860
简直就像重生
It's like birth, you know.

989
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,080
一个人进入医院
One person enters the hospital,

990
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,330
两个人出来
two people come out.

991
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,950
边走边说
Walk and talk.

992
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,240
我会在飞机上告诉你
I'll tell you on the plane.

993
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,580
什么飞机
What plane?

994
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,630
我的线人告诉我你的骑士们在澳门
My sources tell me your horsemen are in Macau.

995
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,340
这表情怎么回事
What's the look?

996
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,670
不关你的事
It's none of your business.

997
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,920
你的线人是谁
Who are your sources?

998
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,680
就是些老朋友
Just some old friends.

999
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,610
等拿到卡我去哪
When we have the card, where do I go?

1000
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,980
零比五十二
And 0 for 52.

1001
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,060
完美 完美的比分
Well, it's perfect. It's a perfect score.

1002
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,980
那女孩们呢？
Then what about girls?

1003
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,870
感情史？
Like, relationships?

1004
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,070
什么？
What?

1005
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,630
听着 这不是我引以为傲的故事
Look, it's not something I'm proud of,

1006
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,210
但每个我亲近的女孩
but every girl i get close to,

1007
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,710
最后我都辜负了她们的信任
I end up taking their trust.

1008
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,210
还掏空了她们的钱包
And then their wallet.

1009
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:22,970
所以…
So...

1010
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,890
你拿她们的钱包？
You take their wallets?

1011
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:27,970
对
Yeah.

1012
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,270
还拿她们的皮带吗？
You ever take their belts?

1013
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:34,940
或者
Or how about

1014
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,190
酒店吧台的花生？
some peanuts from the hotel bar?

1015
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,190
不知道你拿那些干什么
Not sure why you took those.

1016
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:44,360
对不起 你是不是以为我也跟 其他女孩一样？
I'm sorry, did you think that I was like those other girls?

1017
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,820
噢 杰克
Oh, Jack.

1018
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,750
好 街尾有个市场
Okay. So there's a marketplace down the street.

1019
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,920
我要见一个戴蓝帽子的人
And I'm meeting a man with a blue hat.

1020
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,750
他会找到合适的人带我们回家
He'll get the stick to the right people and get us home.

1021
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,800
你去叫上梅里特好吗？ 我们有很多事要做
You go grab merritt, okay? We got a lot to do.

1022
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,680
还有 嘿 系上腰带
And, hey, put your belt on.

1023
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,380
噢 不是那样的 她从我身上解下来的…
Oh, no, it's not... She took it off me and...

1024
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,340
你知道 我这辈子最伤心的时刻
You know, the most heartbreaking moment of my life

1025
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,690
就是当我发现
was when I discovered

1026
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,190
你偷走了我所有的钱然后分了
that you had stolen all my money and split.

1027
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:18,350
我知道现在才发现
I didn't realize until now

1028
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,940
你当时拿了多大一笔钱
how much of that money you put into your face.

1029
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,700
说真的 鼻子下面的毛 比头顶的还多不觉得奇怪吗
Seriously, is it weird to have more hair in your nose than on your head?

1030
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,240
说起来 下次你植发的时候
Speaking of, next time you get a hair transplant,

1031
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,030
你应该考虑下别的产品
you might wanna consider requesting

1032
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:33,960
而不是老头子的阴毛
something other than old man pubes.

1033
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,080
你真是个丑角 小梅
You know what? You are such a buffoon, mer-bear.

1034
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,080
你自己拖住我 让你朋友
And this little ploy you have

1035
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:44,260
在背后搞我老板的这套小把戏
of stalling me while your friends screw over my employer?

1036
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,970
是行不通的
Not gonna work.

1037
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,090
沙斯 当你直视我的双眼
Chase! As you stare into my eyes,

1038
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:52,480
你会发现自己想睡觉
you will find that you wanna sleep.

1039
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,020
当你醒来 你会祈求梅里特的原谅
When you wake, you will beg for merritt's forgiveness

1040
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,480
并弄明白自己永远比不上他的一半好
and realize that you will never be half the man that he is.

1041
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,730
梅里特
Merritt,

1042
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:07,150
真的非常非常对不起
I am so, so very, very sorry

1043
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,990
你的这个学生真是太可悲了
about how pathetic your pupil is.

1044
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:13,250
嘿 给你一个关于惊喜的建议
Hey, a little hint on your technique of surprise.

1045
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:17,040
你的惊喜根本就没有一点 惊喜所需要的元素
It lacks that all-essential little element of surprise.

1046
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,370
嘿 这很有意思 小梅
Hey, this has been fun, mer-bear.

1047
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,460
下次有空再试试
Let's do it again sometime.

1048
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,420
好吧
Well,

1049
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,960
我有足够的时间做一些研究
I've had ample time to do some research, and you know,

1050
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:35,810
我认为 天眼也许是真的
I think the eye might actually be real.

1051
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,270
我还以为你不信那些
Thought you didn't buy into all that.

1052
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,310
要是我说我不认为
I'd be lying if i said I didn't think

1053
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,860
这条路能指引我找到幕后的 伟大魔术师
that this road would lead to the great wizard behind the curtain

1054
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,360
并最终见到他的脸 那我肯定在撒谎
and, in the end, i might get to see his face.

1055
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,320
- 那是不可能的  - 即使四骑士的性命都寄托于此？
Even if the fate of the horsemen depends on it?

1056
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,820
听我说 我把你带出来了
Listen to me. I broke you out of there.

1057
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,070
我们现在不会改变协议
We're not changing the terms now.

1058
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,330
- 是你把我弄进去的  - 对
- You put me there!  - Yeah,

1059
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:53,910
因为你活该呆在那
because you deserve to be there.

1060
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,540
听着 我没杀你父亲
Listen, I did not kill your father.

1061
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:00,450
- 什么  - 好吧 好吧 就别废话了
All right, all right, let's just cut the bullshit.

1062
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,920
我知道你是谁
I know who you are,

1063
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,170
伯劳
shrike.

1064
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,460
我知道你把你爸爸的死怪在我身上
I know you blame me for your father's death.

1065
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:11,500
我知道你认为是我刺激他 让他表演一个自己没法完成的技法
I know you think i goaded him into performing a trick he couldn't pull off.

1066
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,930
我知道进监狱是一个酝酿了三十年的
I know the time in jail was a result

1067
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,100
针对我的复仇计划的结果
of a 30-year revenge plot against me.

1068
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,810
就算那些都是针对 你觉得我会现在告诉你吗
Supposing that's all true, you think I'd tell you now?

1069
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,010
天啊
Man.

1070
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,940
三十年
30 years.

1071
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:29,110
创造了史上最伟大的长时间魔术技法
And the greatest long game magic trick ever created.

1072
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,480
就为了把我关进监狱
Just to put me behind bars.

1073
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,870
好吧
Okay.

1074
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:36,410
看到我进去感觉如何？
So how did it feel, seeing me there?

1075
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,200
那一切就是你所希望的吗
Was it all you hoped?

1076
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,410
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

1077
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:41,580
你在撒谎
You're lying.

1078
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,960
那是空虚的感觉
It was an empty experience.

1079
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,040
想知道我怎么知道的吗
And you wanna know how I know?

1080
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:50,960
我知道因为你知道
I know because you know.

1081
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:55,390
永远 永远都是
There's always, always more

1082
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,220
- 不只是表面的这些  - 那又怎么样
- than what's on the surface.  - So what,

1083
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,850
过去的事情没有发生 你也不是我想象的那样？
the past didn't happen, and you're not who I think you are?

1084
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,430
别跟我说三十年里
Now, don't tell me in 30 years

1085
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,310
这是你第一次问自己那个问题
that's the first time you've asked yourself that question.

1086
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,480
我不是我爸爸
I am not my father.

1087
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,310
你没法影响我 好吗
You're not getting in my head, okay?

1088
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:09,980
你以为能把我引入陷阱？你不行
You think you're luring me into a trap? You're not.

1089
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,570
现在我是很急 这意味着我很危险
Now, I am desperate, which means I'm dangerous.

1090
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:16,200
我唯一担心的就是四骑士的健康状况
My only concern is the health and well-being of the horsemen.

1091
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,990
你要带我找到他们 如果你不带
And you're gonna lead me to them. And if you don't,

1092
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,990
我保证 你的下场绝对比
I promise you, you're gonna end up far worse

1093
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,580
轻松的躺在牢房里要悲惨的多
than in some cushy jail cell somewhere.

1094
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:40,640
要是四骑士其实不需要你拯救呢？
What if the horsemen don't actually need you to save them?

1095
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,940
好 实验室是由两个分离的隔断组成
All right. So the lab is made up of two distinct layers,

1096
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,230
安保外围
the security perimeter

1097
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,230
以及无菌室
and the clean room.

1098
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,280
我们找的芯片应该在这个中心
The stick we're looking for should be in this core.

1099
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,320
所以我们要到那下面 拿到芯片
So we're gonna have to get underneath, extract it,

1100
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,240
然后用个仿制品替换掉
and replace it with a decoy.

1101
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:03,210
现在回到芯片上 这芯片很轻 幸运的是跟扑克牌大小重量差不多
Luckily, it's similar in weight and size to a playing card,

1102
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,170
所以我们要把飞牌技术再精进一下
so we're gonna have to brush up on our card-istry.

1103
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:08,290
喔 喔
Whoa, whoa!

1104
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,970
那样不行
That's no good.

1105
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,600
那我们要怎么进去？哈尼斯·派克
So how do we get in? Hannes pike.

1106
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,480
他是南非黑帮的儿子
He's the son of a south African gangster.

1107
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,440
有一个好像是负责
He's rsvp'd with what looks like

1108
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,310
安保细节的人跟他联系过
a couple of members of his security detail.

1109
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:34,360
一个医生 可能是兽医 还有个叫巴菲的人
A doctor, to vet it, I guess, and somebody named Buffy.

1110
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:38,150
对 而且他每周旅行都会换女人
Yeah, apparently, he travels with a different bimbo every week. Hmm.

1111
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,200
不知道我们谁来演那个女人呢
I wonder which one of us gets to play the bimbo.

1112
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,330
嘿 我能加入吗
Hey, can I get in?

1113
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,590
在老虎机柔和的声音中
At the soothing sound of the slots

1114
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:58,170
你进入平静的状态昏昏欲睡
you slip into a serene state of slumber and sleep.

1115
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:03,980
杰克 一段时间里他们会认为你是 汗内斯 拖住他们
They will think you're hannes, so lead them out and keep them busy.

1116
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,180
他对你们无条件的信任
You trust your people implicitly.

1117
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,230
你会让他们处理一切
You will have them take care of everything,

1118
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:09,640
你会在车上等着
and you will wait in the car.

1119
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,360
睁开眼睛 醒过来 去
And eyes open, wide awake. Go.

1120
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,280
不好意思 这些人在跟着我
Excuse me. These people are following me.

1121
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,530
你也许该检查一下他们的口袋
You might wanna check their pockets.

1122
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,330
然后我们有很短的时间进入实验室
Then our time is ticking to infiltrate the lab

1123
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:23,700
把芯片偷出来拿到市场上
and get the card to the market,

1124
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,200
我会交给天眼
where I'll hand it off to the eye,

1125
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,200
然后我们就都能回家了
so we can all get the hell home.

1126
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,430
啊 汗内斯 老朋友
Ah! Hannes, my old friend.

1127
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,140
你能来真是太好了
So glad you could make it.

1128
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:52,280
我就知道你特别钟情于老式投标
I knew you had a soft spot for an old-school bidding war.

1129
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,400
最近怎么样？
How have you been?

1130
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,100
我完全相信我手下的人 让他们处理
I trust my people implicitly.

1131
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,320
当然 但你肯定想亲自看一看
Certainly. But I'm sure you'd like to see it for yourself.

1132
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,160
拿在手里检查一下质量
Hold it in your hands, check the build quality.

1133
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,160
或者不看 没关系
Or not. Also fine.

1134
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,240
请各位跟我来
Well, if you'd like to follow me.

1135
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,250
你们必须取下身上的金属
You'll have to remove all your metal.

1136
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,460
手表 戒指之类的
Watches, rings, etc.

1137
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,710
当然
Yeah, of course.

1138
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:20,590
冒昧问一句
Excuse me for asking...

1139
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,510
我以前是不是在哪见过你们？
Where might i have seen you before?

1140
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,260
我不知道 可能是在我的座谈会上
I don't know, probably one of my many symposiums.

1141
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,430
皮书套
The book jacket!

1142
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,100
我得说 迈克尔拉斯基先生
I have to say, Dr. michaelakis,

1143
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,350
我是你的忠实书迷
I'm a huge fan.

1144
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,320
噢 非常感谢
Oh, thank you so much.

1145
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,770
哪本书？我的书太多了
Uh, which book? There have been so many.

1146
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,650
汗内斯经常跟你这样开玩笑吗 医生
Does hannes' chippy always talk for you, doctor?

1147
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,520
医生？
Doctor?

1148
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,120
对不起 你说玩笑 我们就总认为是说这个家伙
Sorry, when you say "chippy," you are referring to Buffy here, yeah?

1149
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,280
当然
Of course.

1150
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,340
汗内斯更喜欢用“荡妇”来形容
Hannes prefers the term "floozy"

1151
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,630
他的所有男玩具们
for all his boy toys.

1152
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,670
- 对  - 记住了
- Yeah.  - He does. That's good. Noted.

1153
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,790
顺便 我收到了你的邮件 迈克尔拉斯基先生
By the way, i got your email, Dr. michaelakis.

1154
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,430
你对我们在室温下
You had a query about our ability

1155
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,550
不使用稀释 冰箱
to maintain quantum coherence at room temperature

1156
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,470
维持量子相干性的能力提出了质疑
without the use of dilution, refrigerators,

1157
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,220
或者说纠错
or error correction.

1158
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,800
你可以说明一下吗？
Do you care to elucidate?

1159
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,350
- 没错  - 是的
- Right.  - Yeah.

1160
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,350
是的 我是发过那封邮件
Yes, I did send that email.

1161
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,150
- 那天我看到了  - 是我发的
- The other day, I saw you.  - I did, I sent it.

1162
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:17,400
那么 有什么内幕消息？
So what gives?

1163
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,810
抱歉 什么内幕…
I'm sorry, what gives...

1164
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,480
我想她想说的是…
I think what she's trying to say...

1165
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,530
好了 我们这些大人要开会了 巴菲
Actually, the grown-ups are having a meeting, Buffy.

1166
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:23,820
好吧
Okay.

1167
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,280
请你帮我拿着
If you'll hold on to that.

1168
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,110
- 好的 没问题 博士  - 谢谢
- Yeah, sure, doctor.  - Thank you.

1169
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,530
听着 每个七年级的学生 甚至包括哪些蠢学生
Now, every seventh grader, even the dumb ones,

1170
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,660
都知道热力学第二定律
know the second law of thermodynamics.

1171
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,670
“所有有序的系统都将趋于无序状态”
"All ordered systems tend toward disorder."

1172
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,460
混乱
Disorder!

1173
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:39,330
所以我要再问你一次 先生 有什么内幕消息？
So I'm going to ask you one more time, sir, what gives?

1174
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,180
这其实涉及到拓扑量子顺序
Well, it's actually topological quantum order.

1175
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,270
是指量子效应在宏观的层面体现
The emergence of quantum effects on a macroscopic level.

1176
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,230
那就是所谓的内幕
So that is, in fact, what gives.

1177
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,310
谢谢你
Thank you.

1178
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,820
你知道 巴菲这名字挺适合你的
You know, Buffy is not a bad name for you.

1179
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:15,540
你知道的 巴夫 费姆 陶特
You know, buff, firm, taut.

1180
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,460
很不错 你是在哪 找了本字典吗？
That's good. Did you just find a thesaurus somewhere?

1181
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,750
努比莱
Nubile.

1182
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,500
- 很好  - 谢谢你 好的
- That's good. - Thank you. Okay.

1183
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,920
好了
There we go.

1184
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:33,940
抱歉 抱歉
Sorry, sorry.

1185
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,400
那手杖是金属的 我们怎么带出去？
The stick's metal. How are we going to get it out?

1186
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,610
是啊 我不知道
Yeah. I don't know.

1187
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,610
就是这里了
This is the housing.

1188
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:51,650
传输速度达到了八亿两千万量子英里
820 million qubit miles of digi-synaptic resonance.

1189
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,200
当然了 让我们和其它 人产生不同的
But of course, what sets us apart from anything else on the planet

1190
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:01,750
就是我们的处理器
is the processor,

1191
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,760
我们玩笑的把它称为“魔法扫帚”
which we playfully refer to as the magic broomstick.

1192
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,880
扫帚？
The broomstick?

1193
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,340
有着清理地球上
Has the power to clear the contents

1194
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,670
任何电脑系统内容
of any computing system on the planet

1195
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:12,470
并将其传输给你的能力
and then magically sweep them into your bin.

1196
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,220
扫帚 真有趣
Ah! Broomstick. That's funny.

1197
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,890
看看吧 随你怎么检查
Take a look, vet it however you'd like,

1198
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,430
然后告诉汗内斯 我们将于周一投标
and tell hannes we'll be taking bids on Monday.

1199
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:21,640
谢谢你
Thank you.

1200
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,480
我的天 这里面肯定 有什么东西让我过敏了
Oh, my god. I must be allergic to something in here.

1201
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,280
你怎么可能在这里面 发生过敏反应呢？
What could you possibly be allergic to in here?

1202
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,320
这房间是密封的
This room is hermetically sealed.

1203
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,650
就是它
That's it.

1204
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:35,490
- 看来是对电子辐射过敏  - 好的 把他扶到一边去
If we could get him away from the computer, please.

1205
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,910
这是唯一的可能
That's the one thing.

1206
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:38,290
让他恢复一下
Just until he's recovered.

1207
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,790
我们还需要点抗菌药…
We're gonna need some anti-bacterial...

1208
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,710
这里有湿巾吗？
Do we have alcohol wipes?

1209
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:45,250
如果你要靠近 就必须确保手部是无菌的
Your hands need to be sterile if you intend to get any closer.

1210
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,460
你听明白了吗？
Do I make myself clear?

1211
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,550
抱歉 我们不能…
Sorry. We couldn't...

1212
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,840
不 我很好
No, I'm fine.

1213
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,310
把这药吃了吧
...take his medicine into the country.

1214
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:54,470
是的
Yeah.

1215
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,390
不能再接触过敏源了
Can't risk any contamination.

1216
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:02,980
到时候你得离它远一点
You're gonna have to stay away from the inner workings.

1217
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,520
非常感谢 谢谢
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1218

- This happens to him sometimes. It'll pass.  - Allergies.

1221
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:12,330
过敏 你什么也做不了
Allergies. Nothing you can do.

1222
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,330
你能做点什么 医生
Well, something you could do, doctor.

1223
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,430
没事了吧？
Okay?

1224
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,480
搜他的身
Search him, please.

1225
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,860
刚才不是搜过了吗？
Didn't we just do that?

1226
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,860
- 我们什么也没做  - 好的 我要全方位检查系统
Okay. I wanna run full diagnostics on the system.

1227
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,080
这完全没有必要
This is completely unnecessary.

1228
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,900
举手 举手
Up, up.

1229
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,060
好的
Okay.

1230
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,380

Hey! I can walk on my own.

1232
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,880
哇
Whoa!

1233
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,590
抱歉
Sorry.

我自己来
I can do that myself.

1236
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:21,780
我们刚认识 伙计
We just met, man.

1237
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,120
毛手毛脚的
Handsy, handsy, handsy.

1238
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:36,510
嘿
Hey!

1239
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:40,090
我的眼睛在这 伙计
My eyes are up here, man.

1240
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,630
你喜欢吗？
How do you like it?

1241
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,160
嘿 我没事
Hey, I'm good.

1242
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:07,910
转身
Turn around.

1243
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,470
你这有东西吗？
Do you have anything?

1244
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,060
我不知道 不能相信任何人
I don't know. Can't trust anybody.

1245
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,770
我没事
I'm good.

1246
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:32,860
他们是安全的
They're clean.

1247
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,190
最后检查一下 然后让他们出去
Do your final checks and get them out of here.

1248
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:38,690
- 好的  - 我们又走这边了
Oh, we're walking this way again. Yay.

1249
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,830
我不会说话
I don't speak the language.

1250
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:55,630
看到没？
See?

1251
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:57,550
我怎么跟你说的？ 我们什么都没有
What did I tell you, man? We didn't have anything.

1252
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:01,010
谢谢 伙计 非常感谢
Thanks, pal. Appreciate that.

1253
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,570
这个像白色舞池的东西
Something about a big white dance floor,

1254
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:20,770
让我想摆动身体
makes me wanna boogie.

1255
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,240
嘿 感谢邀请我们
Hey, thanks for having us.

1256
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,660
那东西真不错
That's great stuff.

1257
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:35,590
好吧 你们的安保措施 还真是严格啊
You guys are pretty serious about your security, huh?

1258
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,590
- 过去吧  - 好的
Okay.

1259
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:43,100
我的东西都在吗？ 我觉得我进来的时候
Do I have all my things? I feel like I came in

1260
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,760
还带着更多的东西 都在这里了吗？
with more stuff. Did I come in with more stuff?

1261
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:47,930
你不这么想？
You don't think so?

1262
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,810
先生 我想我的钱包还在你那
Uh, sir, I think you still have my wallet.

1263
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:56,610
记得吗 我进来的时候给你了
Remember, I, uh, gave it to you when I came in?

1264
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,770
我想把它要回来
It would be nice to leave with it.

1265
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:04,870
钱包要通过了
Wallet coming through.

1266
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,960
抱歉 是我的皮带
Sorry, my belt.

1267
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:21,170
呃…
Uh...

1268
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:23,260
我想都在这了 对吧？
I guess that's everything, right?

1269
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,590
谢谢你
Thank you.

1270
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,050
- 那不是玩具 巴菲  - 抱歉
- That is not a toy, Buffy.  - Sorry.

1271
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:33,940
走走走
Go, go, go!

1272
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,280
好的 在市场上放我下去
All right. Now, drop me off at the market

1273
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:47,660
- 我能找到  - 你说他们离开时候通知你
- you asked me to call.  - you when they started running around like headless chickens.

1274
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:49,990
是的 就是那么回事
Well, that's what's happening.

1275
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,300
这就是他们说的地方？
This is where your sources told you they'd be?

1276
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:11,220
不 他只是告诉我 也许能在这找到答案
No, this is where my sources said we might find an answer.

1277
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,200
她肯定很了解你的事
She must be familiar with your work.

1278
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,820
打搅一下
Excuse me.

1279
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,160
小姐 你见过这些人吗？
Miss, have you seen these people?

1280
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,050
她说她的孙子跟他们的 老大说过话
She says her grandson spoke to their leader.

1281
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,260
他在后面
He's in the back.

1282
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,220
什么？
What?

1283
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,170
不 你会说汉语？
No "wow, you speak mandarin"?

1284
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:21,000
大变活人
Ah! The coffin to the beyond.

1285
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,840
总是涉及到暗门
It was always a flap,

1286
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,050
陷阱或者镜子
or a trap or mirrors.

1287
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:31,050
观众们认为他就那样消失了
The audience thought he'd just disappeared.

1288
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:35,730
但是他总是藏在 里面的某个地方
But he was always hidden somewhere inside.

1289
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:52,040
我想这就是你父亲 所做那东西的原型
I believe that's the prototype for the one your father had made.

1290
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,290
他和那些年的很多人一样
He, like many others over the years,

1291
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:54,500
都是从这里订做道具的
ordered his supplies from here.

1292
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,450
啊！
Ah!

1293
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,290
当然了
Of course.

1294
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,160
所以当我说他们在澳门时
That's why you gave me the look

1295
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,130
你给我摆脸色
when I said they were in Macau.

1296
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:05,300
你父亲在你小时候来过这里
Your father used to come here when you were young.

1297
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,170
能给我一些空间吗？
Can I please get some space here?

1298
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:15,100
你认为你是唯一一个
You think you're the only one who'd wondered for 30 years

1299
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,890
对所发生的事情质疑了三十年的人吗？
what happened?

1300
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,470
不是的
You're not.

1301
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,010
莱昂内尔是魔术大师
Lionel was a master magician.

1302
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:22,480
他要么在前面缠上锁链
Either he gamed the hinges,

1303
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,150
这样就能踹开门跳出来
so he could kick the door and they would pop out,

1304
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,770
要么使用内部的锁
or he had access to the lock from the inside

1305
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,070
这样就能开锁
so he could pick it.

1306
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:31,770
人们说
Word is

1307
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,910
保险箱是廉价金属做的 所以很容易弄开
the safe was made from cheap metal, and it bowed.

1308
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:40,450
他的袖子里总是藏着东西
Still, he always had something up his sleeve.

1309
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:44,500
但最后他达到了他能力的极限
Unless he'd reached the limit of his capabilities

1310
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:47,250
用尽了技巧
and his clock ran out.

1311
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,800
抱歉
Excuse me.

1312
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:56,140
我奶奶那儿也许有你要的东西
My grandmother has something you might want.

1313
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,480
这是你父亲的
This was your father's.

1314
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,900
他订做了几个这样的东西
He had several of these made.

1315
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,570
那么四骑士的事呢？
And the horsemen?

1316
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,960
我偶然听到他们谈话
I overheard them talking.

1317
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,880
当时他们其中一个叫阿特拉斯的
One of them, atlas, he's meeting someone

1318
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,390
在附近的市场上见什么人
at the market nearby.

1319
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:52,320
至于前特工罗兹
As for former agent rhodes,

1320
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,070
查清他的所在是我们的首要任务
his location is now your number one priority.

1321
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,240
我们已经发布了国际通告
We're putting out an international apb.

1322
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,570
我们需要当地部门的合作
Including cooperation from local authorities.

1323
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,410
考恩特工
Agent cowan.

1324
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,250
我想你应该没有
I'm assuming it was actually not you

1325
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:05,080
进入纽伯格联邦监狱

1326
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,080
然后三十分钟后和 撒迪厄斯·布兰德利一起离开了吧？
then walked out 30 minutes later with Thaddeus Bradley?

1327
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,080
- 什么？ - 他用了你的ID
- What?  - He used your ID.

1328
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,140
你在做什么 罗兹？

- 我搞砸了 抱歉  - 你来这里做什么？
- I blew it, I'm sorry.  - What are you doing here?

1331

我是来帮忙的

好的 我们绝对不需要你的帮助

1333
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,290
我知道我搞砸了 好吗？
I know I messed up, all right?

1334
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:52,920
是的 你让大家都身陷险境
Yeah, you put everybody's lives in danger.

1335
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:55,300

我没等任何人

01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,660
你为何和他们谈？
Why are you talking to the eye?

1353
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,200
阿特拉斯
Atlas.

1354
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,630
阿特拉斯 给我说清楚
Atlas, give me the stick.

1355
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:35,170
迪连 你已经不是我们的老大了 好吗？
Dylan, you're not our leader anymore, okay?

1356
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:36,510
你不是我们的英雄
You're not our hero.

1357
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:37,960
你也不是FBI
You're not FBI.

1358
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:39,300
你不是魔术师
You're not a magician.

1359
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,960
你根本什么也不是
You're not really anything.

1360
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:43,640
我们相信了你一年
And we trusted you for a year.

1361
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,310
所以如果你真的想帮助我们…
So if you really wanna help us...

1362
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:49,060
如果你真想帮助我们 那你就离开
If you really wanna help us, you would leave.

1363
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,530
我懂了 好的
I get it. Cool.

1364
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:00,570
再见
Bye.

1365
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:22,060
是的 你在魔术店联系的 那个人就是我
Yeah, that was me you called at the magic shop.

1366
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,510
但还是很有趣
So much fun though,

1367
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,060
我知道你在实验室会被我吓跑
knowing you'd be scurrying away from me at the lab

1368
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,350
所以我来了这里
just to bring it to me here.

1369
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:29,220
你真的认为我会让你走吗？
Did you actually think I'd let you go?

1370
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,390
你是怎么做到的？
How did you do that?

1371
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:32,020
每个人都有自己的弱点
Everyone has their button.

1372
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,400
一旦按下去 就变瞎了
You push it and they go blind.

1373
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,480
而你的弱点就是自负
And yours, obviously, is ego.

1374
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:37,570
“坚持到底
"Stay the course.

1375
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:40,400
巨变即将发生
"Great changes are in store.

1376
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,080
相信你独特的才能
"Trust that your unique talents

1377
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,620
将会被人所知”
"will not go unrecognized."

1378
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,410
- 那个是你  - 是的
- That was you.  - Yeah.

1379
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,030
梅里特下载了所有的文件
Merritt downloaded all the files,

1380
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,700
但你认为我们是 怎么找到他的呢？
but how do you think we were able to find him?

1381
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:56,750
我想看看幕后黑手
I asked to see the face behind all of this.

1382
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,710
被你手机录下的 其实是平板电脑的声音
What you actually put your phone on was a bi-wave siphon pad.

1383
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,600
又一次
Once again,

1384
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,180
科学战胜了魔术
science beats magic.

1385
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,510
- 那么 我要的东西呢？ - 没在
- So, the stick?  - No.

1386
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,610
在我这
I got it!

1387
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:14,190
在我这 在我这
I got it. I got it.

1388
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:18,110
- 该死 迪连  - 等等 别管他们
- Fuck, Dylan!  - Wait, leave them!

1389
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:19,610
你真以为我会就那样离开？
You really think I'm gonna walk away from you?

1390
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:21,730
把那东西给我
Give me the stick!

1391
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:24,780
- 给我 别再质疑我  - 好的
All right. Don't ever question me again.

1392
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:26,080
滚开
Beat it!

1393
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:39,420
- 好的 东西给我  - 去死吧
- So, the stick.  - Go to hell.

1394
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:41,250
各位
Boys.

1395
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,560
抱歉 抱歉
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1396
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,330
你们可有不少人
There's like 10 of you.

1397
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:15,210
拜托 他只是在耍小伎俩
Come on, he's just doing tricks.

1398
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:17,170
他在那 快去
He's there! Go!

1399
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,800
哦…
Oh...

1400
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:44,670
迪连 看着这会飞的小鸟 睡着吧
Dylan, watch the pretty birdies fly. And sleep.

1401
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,840
对我可没用
Doesn't work on me.

1402
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,260
难道就不能让你分心吗？
Not even as a distraction?

1403
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,480
- 干的好  - 还是自己动手好
- Good job.  - Nice to be involved.

1404
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:04,730
嘿 各位 各位 嘿
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

1405
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,360
我刚才见到了迪连 出事了
I just saw Dylan. Um, something happened.

1406
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,480
你说这话是什么意思？
What do you mean you just saw Dylan?

1407
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:09,570
迪连在这里？发生什么了？
Dylan's here? What happened?

1408
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:12,000
- 阿特拉斯  - 我不知道 我不知道
- Atlas.  - I don't know.

1409
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:18,240
他们在做什么？
What are they doing?

1410
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,620
那些是沃尔特的人
Those are Walter's men.

1411
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:23,800
这就是他们要的
This is what they want.

1412
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,010
搞什么？怎么还在你手上？
What the hell? How do you still have that?

1413
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,810
那是莱昂内尔·伯劳的保险箱
Whoa. That's Lionel shrike's safe.

1414
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:35,470
他们要用那个做什么？
What the hell do they want with that?

1415
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:37,310
好的 我们得跟着那卡车
Okay, we gotta follow that truck.

1416
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:40,640
迪连肯定在他们手上 我们的时间不多
They must have Dylan. We don't have much time.

1417
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:46,400
你要什么？
What do you want?

1418
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,980
你知道一些非常重要的事情
You to understand something very important.

1419
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,620
我们
We

1420
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,410
是镜像
are mirror images.

1421
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:57,990
和你一样 我和我父亲 有着很深的联系
I share a very deep connection with my father.

1422
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:01,950
而且和你一样 我将不惜一切代价
And like you, I'll stop at nothing

1423
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:04,460
为他进行复仇
to avenge any wrongs done to him.

1424
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,640
你知道你父亲和我父亲 唯一的区别吗？
You know the only difference between your father and mine?

1425
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,600
我父亲还活着
Mine's still alive.

1426
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:16,510
让他起来
Get him up.

1427
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,560
那么
So,

1428
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:34,410
就是这个人
this is the man

1429
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:37,530
花了一辈子时间暗算我
who spent a lifetime plotting against me.

1430
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:41,820
即使你的巨幅海报挂在 我的卧室窗户外面
I wouldn't have known your face

1431
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:45,500
我也认不出来你是谁
if it had been on a billboard outside my bedroom window.

1432
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,710
但你却花了三十年时间
But you have spent, what, 30 years

1433
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,080
一直算计我？
thinking about mine?

1434
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:50,710
当我父亲死的时候
When my father died,

1435
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,720
你的保险公司 拒绝了我母亲的请求
your insurance company denied my mother her claims.

1436
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,050
- 她穷苦而死  - 我甚至不知道…
- I wouldn't even have known...  - She died a pauper!

1437
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,010
你的母亲是谁
...who your mother was.

1438
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,050
她只是个数字
She was a digit,

1439
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:00,720
是连续不断数据流中 一个毫无意义的字节
a nanobyte in a stream of data.

1440
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,730
因为你不关心任何事
Because nothing is personal to you

1441
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:04,980
任何人和任何事对于 你来说都只是数字 对吧？
and everyone and everything is just a number, isn't that so?

1442
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:07,730
那正是你错的地方 罗兹先生
That is where you are wrong, Mr. rhodes.

1443
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:12,740
一旦你出名了 那就跟你有关了
Once you made yourself known it became very personal.

1444
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:15,820
- 我的儿子…  - 是的 反社会的家伙
- My son...  - Yeah, the sociopath.

1445
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:17,360
有趣的是
Funny thing is,

1446
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:20,610
我有七个所谓的婚生子女
I have seven so-called legitimate children.

1447
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:22,120
他们虚情假意 十分势力
Sniveling, snobbish,

1448
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:24,040
而且愚蠢无比
stupid runts.

1449
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,620
但我有一个和我一样的私生子
I have one illegitimate child who is a lot like me.

1450
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:30,000
问题是 他想要一些东西
The point is, he wants something,

1451
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,710
像那些好的父母一样
and like any good parent,

1452
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:34,090
我将不惜一切代价
I will stop at nothing

1453
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,430
为他争取到他想要的
to get it for him.

1454
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:37,090
那东西就在你的骑士身上
Your horsemen have it.

1455
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:39,630
你会把它和他们
You will turn it and them

1456
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,590
现在就交给我们
over to us, now.

1457
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:42,770
不
No.

1458
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,060
迪连 我很希望你好好记住这一刻
Dylan, I would like you to really take this moment

1459
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,770
因为这就是你找到仇人之后
because this is the consequence

1460
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:52,780
妄图想要复仇所
of your personal vendetta come to life

1461
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:54,650
得到的悲惨结果
and staring you in the face.

1462
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:56,400
我要你知道等你死了 我们不会收拾
I want you to know that when you're gone,

1463
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:59,780
我们将毁了你相信的一切
we're gonna destroy everything you believe in,

1464
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:01,950
先从四骑士开始 最后毁了“天眼”
starting with the horsemen, and ending with the eye.

1465
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,870
现在 鼓起你的勇气
Now then, cast your mind back

1466
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:07,040
站在这亲眼目睹你父亲失败
to standing by the banks of the river watching your father descend,

1467
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,080
遭遇耻辱并名誉扫地的河岸边
disgraced and discredited.

1468
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,960
这些年来你感受到的恐惧
The horrid psychic pain as you have relived for years.

1469
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,800
我感受到同样的感觉
I felt that same thing

1470
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,670
两年前你不仅毁了 我父亲的前途
as you drained not just my father's fortune,

1471
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,760
还有他的尊严
but his dignity!

1472
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,800
而你却从中得到快乐
And yet you took pleasure from it.

1473
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,140
这应该能给你带回一些童年记忆
This should bring back some childhood memories.

1474
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:56,590
- 想喝点茶吗？ - 谢谢你
- Would you like some tea? Oh.  - Thank you.

1475
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:14,530
- 你准备好了吗？ - 请便
- You ready?  - Over to you.

1476
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,620
水花
Splash!

1477
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,540
完事了
Job done!

1478
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:46,060
看起来还得等不少时间
Hell is going to seem like a day at the spa

1479
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:49,010
到时候我们就把骑士灭了
by the time we're through with these horsemen.

1480
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:51,810
- 你说呢？ - 完全正确
- Wouldn't you say?  - You had me at "hell."

1481
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:11,040
我非常爱你
I love you so much.

1482
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:16,000
我的袖子里总是藏着东西
Always keep something up my sleeve.

1483
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,000
我希望我能洗净自己的灵魂
I wish I could dredge from the muck of my soul

1484
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,170
让它毫无污秽
one speck of remorse,

1485
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,130
但这是不可能的
but I can't.

1486
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:45,380
所以我会继续做着生意
So I'll stick to the business at hand

1487
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:47,970
并试着别笑得太明显
and try not to smile too broadly.

1488
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,630
还有 谢谢你
And, uh, thank you

1489
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:54,020
为我送来迪连 罗兹先生
for delivering Mr. Dylan rhodes.

1490
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:56,690
我想这事已经完了
I take it it's done.

1491
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,900
已经触到了底部了
Literally hit the bottom.

1492
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:01,350
那么
Now,

1493
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,110
四骑士在哪？
where are the horsemen?

1494
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:06,110
他们只是表演的
They're performers.

1495
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:08,360
他们的骄傲和自负…
Their pride, their ego...

1496
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:11,860
他们对于名气的渴望 实在是太强烈了
Their need to be adored are all too powerful

1497
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:13,790
他们无法隐藏太久
to keep them out of the limelight for long.

1498
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:17,000
如果找不到他们
If they don't make themselves known,

1499
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,290
你就会发现你自己
you will find yourself

1500
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:21,790
和罗兹先生一样
in a very similar position

1501
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:23,340
处于一个十分相似的情况
to Mr. rhodes.

1502
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:25,170
清楚了吗？
Are we clear about that?

1503
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,260
和他身处的水一样清
As clear as the water he's under.

1504
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,430
抓住骑士之后
You'll have the rest

1505
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,310
再给你剩下的
when I have the horsemen.

1506
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:11,760
迪连
Dylan!

1507
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:15,390
迪连 拜托 醒醒伙计
Dylan, come on, buddy, breathe!

1508
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:16,850
- 迪连  - 迪连
- Dylan.  - Dylan?

1509
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:18,980
迪连 醒醒
Dylan, come on!

1510
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,940
你没事
You're okay.

1511
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,780
天啊 你吓坏我们了 伙计
Jesus! You scared the hell out of us, man.

1512
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:29,990
你没事吧 伙计？
Are you all right, bro?

1513
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,410
好了
Okay!

1514
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:34,410
- 谢谢你  - 这是我起码能做的
- Thank you!  - This is the least i could do.

1515
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:36,410
不 你本可以袖手旁观的
No. There's a hell of a lot less you could've done.

1516
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,910
我们可不会那样
That was not an option.

1517
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,870
你为我们挡了子弹 那可是大恩情
You took a bullet for us, it was huge.

1518
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:41,160
你真的做到了 伙计
You really did, man.

1519
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:46,210
说真的 感谢你们救我出来
Thanks for pulling me out. Seriously.

1520
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,460
好啊
Yeah.

1521
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:50,800
是你自己出来的 我们只是拉你出水
You got yourself out. We did the easy part.

1522
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,430
是真的 因为我当时
Literally, in my case,

1523
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:53,810
只是站在岸边 是阿特拉斯跳下水
I was just standing on the shore while atlas jumped down

1524
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:54,890
找到你的
and got you.

1525
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:56,470
我说真的
I'm serious.

1526
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,430
嘿 各位 有点不对劲
Hey, you guys. Something's not right.

1527
01:22:58,430 --> 01:22:59,890
- 怎么了？ - 怎么？
- What's wrong?  - What?

1528
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:02,980
这是假的
It's fake.

1529
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:04,230
什么？
What?

1530
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:07,440
不 我拿到了芯片
No, I had the stick.

1531
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,520
是真的芯片 我发誓是真的
The actual stick. I swear, it was in my hand.

1532
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:12,160
然后我把它放在一个小盒子里
In the lab. And then I put it in the little case thing.

1533
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,330
然后给了阿特拉斯
And I gave it to atlas.

1534
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:17,330
等等 迪连 有没有可能 是你错放在什么地方了？
Is there any chance you've possibly misplaced it at any point?

1535
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:21,330
不 我从你手里把它拿走
I took it from you and then slipped it back in your coat

1536
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:23,340
然后把你推开时又还给了你
when I pushed you out.

1537
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:26,170
总之 我们这次算是栽了
Either way, we're left holding a whole sack full of nada.

1538
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:28,920
是的 但他们还是会认为 东西就在我们手上
Yeah, but they're gonna come after us as if we do have something.

1539
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,170
不 好的 我同意有人 战胜了我们
No. Okay. I agree that somebody got the better of us.

1540
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:34,890
但是我不认为我们就一败涂地了
But I don't agree that we have a sack full of nada.

1541
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:36,100
因为我们都在这
Because we're all here.

1542
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,100
这才是最重要的
That's a sack full of something.

1543
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:45,860
听着 我们都知道沃尔特 不得到芯片不会停手
We all know that Walter is not going to stop until he gets that chip.

1544
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:49,360
而且我们是唯一 知道他还活着的人
And we're the only ones that even know that he's alive.

1545
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:52,070
我们不能就这样不管了
We can't just walk away.

1546
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,120
这可不是骑士的风格
That's not what the horsemen do.

1547
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:58,570
有一段话
There's a quote. Um...

1548
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:00,200
这话是一个魔术师说的
It's actually by the magician

1549
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,000
正是他让我走上了这条路
that made me wanna do this in the first place.

1550
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
说的是…
It's, uh...

1551
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,330
“魔术师最大的力量 总是隐藏着
"A magician's greatest power lies forever shrouded

1552
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,580
藏在他空空的拳头里
"in his empty fist."

1553
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:13,140
它能说服世界的唯一办法
"And the very idea that he can convince the world

1554
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:16,300
就是讲此秘密上演”
"that he is, in fact, carrying with him a secret."

1555
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,970
那是莱昂内尔·伯劳说的
That's Lionel shrike.

1556
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:19,050
是的
Right.

1557
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:24,310
那你的意思是我们 要假装我们手头有没有的东西？
That we should pretend like we have something we don't?

1558
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:29,440
沃尔特最大的恐惧是什么？
What is Walter's greatest fear?

1559
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:31,900
被人看见
Being seen.

1560
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,110
那芯片是做什么的？
And what does the stick do?

1561
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,410
那芯片可以破译一切
The stick can unencode anything.

1562
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:38,860
它可以悄然入侵
It can open up a back door into any computer

1563
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:40,410
这星球上的任何一台电脑
on the planet.

1564
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:42,250
- 包括他的  - 是的
- Including his.  - Yeah.

1565
01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:46,540
好的 我们不仅要让他认为 芯片在我们手上
Right, we not only make him think that we have it,

1566
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:50,870
还要让他以为我们将用 芯片将他彻底毁了
but that we're going to use it to expose and destroy him.

1567
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,010
我们需要个计划
We need a plan.

1568
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:54,260
但我们没时间了
But we don't have time.

1569
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:57,880
我们还有彼此 而且我们有五个人
We have each other and there are five of us.

1570
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:00,930
但是我们还需要惊喜 对吧？ 还有必要的资源
But we also need supplies, right? And resources.

1571
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:04,140
或者更多的人
And probably more than five people.

1572
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:08,100
你真认为没人帮你们？
Do you really think you don't have help?

1573
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,980
- 她会说英语  - 当然了
- Oh, she speaks English. Of course.  - Yeah.

1574
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:16,400
你知道为何“愚人”是塔罗牌中力量最大的？
Do you know why the fool is the most powerful card in the tarot?

1575
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:20,150
不是因为抽到它的人就是愚人
Not because the person who draws him is a fool.

1576
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,650
他愚蠢
He's a fool

1577
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:24,580
是因为他有着清白的过去
because he's a clean slate,

1578
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:27,120
因此可以成为
and, therefore, can become

1579
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,580
任何东西
anything.

1580
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:30,080
你们是被选择的人
You were chosen.

1581
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:32,550
你们都是
All of you.

1582
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:35,130
不是因为你们是谁
Not because of who you are,

1583
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,970
而是因为你们将取得的成绩
but because of who you might become.

1584
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:40,630
当你说“被选择”…
When you say "chosen"...

1585
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:43,310
你是“天眼”的一部分？
Are you part of the eye?

1586
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:44,480
是的
Yes.

1587
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,480
我们是“天眼”的一部分
We are part of the eye.

1588
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,690
你们都怀疑我们的存在
You've each doubted our existence.

1589
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,360
想知道
Wondering

1590
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,990
我们是否在观察
if we, indeed, were watching.

1591
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:01,030
我们确实在观察
We are.

1592
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:03,160
我们一直如此
We always have been.

1593
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,660
这可是世界上最好的魔术店
This is the best magic shop in the world.

1594
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:06,950
你明白她说的 对吧？
You know what she's saying, right?

1595
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,080
是的
Yes.

1596
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,410
现在我们有了资源和帮手
That now we have resources and help.

1597
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:13,590
谢谢你
Thank you.

1598
01:26:16,090 --> 01:26:17,720
那么 谁加入？
So, who's in?

1599
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,970
我加入
I'm in.

1600
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:24,270
是的 我加入
Yeah, I'm in.

1601
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:28,140
我们开干吧
Let's do this.

1602
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,450
不不不
No, no, no.

1603
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,250
不久前 我们被人耍了
Not long ago, we were tricked.

1604
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:55,300
我被人发现没有死去
I was exposed and brought back from the dead.

1605
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:58,170
所以我们觉得唯一的办法
So we thought it was only fitting that we do the same thing

1606
01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:00,090
就是以牙还牙
to the person who did it to us.

1607
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,560
除夕 午夜 伦敦
Midnight, new year's Eve. London.

1608
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,310
我们将进行一连串的表演
We will be performing a series of shows

1609
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:06,010
那将会是我们的绝唱
that all connect to our big finale,

1610
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,180
所以你们得好好看着
so pay close attention to each trick.

1611
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:12,280
叫我父亲来 快点
Get my father.

1612
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:15,730
我要找国际刑警 苏格兰场 能找的帮手都找上
I want interpol, Scotland yard, whoever we have in London.

1613
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:17,190
罗兹方面有什么消息？
What do we know about rhodes?

1614
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,150
不管骑士在哪 他都会在那里
Wherever the horsemen are, that's where he is.

1615
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:26,030
- 我们去机场吧  - 准备好 我们要让死人复活了
Because we, too, will bring someone back from the dead.

1616
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,700
各位行动吧
Let's move, everyone!

1617
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,700
在世界最大的舞台前面…
In front of the largest stage in the world...

1618
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,700
真实的世界
The actual world.

1619
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,750
你知道他们在耍你 对吧？
You know they're playing you, right?

1620
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,590
把你引入陷阱
Leading you into a trap?

1621
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:37,460
是的 但这威胁是真的
Yeah, but the threat is real.

1622
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:40,130
这张芯片可以黑进 地球上任何的电脑 包括我们的
This card can hack into any system on the planet, including ours.

1623
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:42,430
现在芯片在他们手上 他们为何就不会用？
They have it, why wouldn't they use it to expose us?

1624
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:44,100
我 我们所做的一切
Me. Everything we've done.

1625
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,180
这是真的吗 麦金尼先生？
Is it real, Mr. mckinney?

1626
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,690
这威胁是真的
The threat is real.

1627
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:57,150
那么 我们要怎么对付他们？
So, how do we stay ahead of them?

1628
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:59,520
我们得在午夜赶到伦敦
We need to get to London by midnight.

1629
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:12,330
我们现在在伦敦 除夕夜充满了人群
On this new year's Eve, and the crowds are out in force.

1630
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:13,750
当地人和游客们
Locals and tourists alike

1631
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:16,130
准备好参加年度大派对了
getting ready for the party of the year.

1632
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:18,130
一段跟四骑士有关的视频
A video gone viral from the infamous

1633
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:20,080
已经在网上疯传了
horsemen magicians has surfaced.

1634
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:24,840
他们真的会按视频中 所说来到现场表演吗？
But will it end in their arrest on national television?

1635
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:26,640
或者说只是一个噱头？
Or some sort of vindication?

1636
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:32,690
- 没人知道实际情况  - 但我们知道人们肯定想看
But we do know, wherever, whenever that is, people will be watching.

1637
01:28:35,230 --> 01:28:37,480
是的 短信 推特 博客
Yeah, texts, tweets, instagrams.

1638
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:40,230
任何和骑士有关系的消息
Anything that says "horsemen," brags about seeing the horsemen,

1639
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:41,850
都给我跟一跟
tag them and bundle them.

1640
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:44,410
爸爸 这一次担任保安的 是谁 是你们吗？
Dad, who do we have security-wise on this? Your guys?

1641
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:47,240
- 你要谁都行  - 都带上 再加上一些人
Well, we want all of them and all their friends.

1642
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:51,620
要做到全城都有我们的人 让他们随时能看到我
Stationed throughout the city, so they can be anywhere in 60 seconds.

1643
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,220
你好 嘿
Hello! Hey!

1644
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:12,640
我叫杰克·怀尔德
My name's Jack Wilder.

1645
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:14,690
该死的 回来的感觉真好
Goddamn, it feels good to be back.

1646
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:17,190
好的 都过来吧
All right, gather around.

1647
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:21,140
我要跟你们分享一些消息
I wanna talk to you about something real quick.

1648
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:24,610
你们都知道三张扑克戏法 也被叫做“找小姐”戏法吗？
You all know three card monte, also known as "find the lady"?

1649
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:28,900
这是一个被世界各地的 街头艺人表演的戏法 为什么是他们？
Trick performed by street hustlers all over the world. And why street hustlers?

1650
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:31,530
因为只要你靠近桌子 你就输了
Because as soon as you walk up to the table, you lose.

1651
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:33,670
每次都是如此 让我示范一遍
Every time. Let me demonstrate.

1652
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:40,580
在此期间 我们找一个活生生的女王
While we're at it, let's find ourselves a life-sized queen.

1653
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:42,630
女士 你能当我的女王吗？
Ma'am, would you mind being my queen?

1654
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,800
别担心 我向你保证
Don't worry. I promise you

1655
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,670
表演结束后你活着 回来的机会是五成
there's a 50% chance you'll get her back after the show.

1656
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:51,550
到那边去 非常感谢
Head over there. Thank you very much.

1657
01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:55,230
好的 我们来找一些 服侍女王的杰克吧
All right. Let's find ourselves some Jacks to serve our queen!

1658
01:29:55,230 --> 01:29:56,520
相信我 先生们
Trust me, gentlemen.

1659
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,730
我知道了这些家伙的计划
I know how these guys work now.

1660
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:00,390
他们先是开玩笑
They're gonna start with a tease.

1661
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,440
来点暖场
A few little pop-ups.

1662
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:05,400
弄点手段引诱你加入
Something to lure you in. Like...

1663
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:09,570
你知道 就像他们现在表演的节目
Well, you know... Like three card monte, where the guy goes,

1664
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:12,290
“看这里 但是不 不 看这里”
"looky here, but no, no, looky here!"

1665
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:16,290
当那些技巧弄完后
Except when all these little tricks are done,

1666
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:18,410
你将看到的唯一东西
the only thing you're gonna be looking at

1667
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:22,510
就是让你感到吃惊的
is the inside of your own colon, with the words

1668
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:25,510
写着“骑士”的卡片
"horsemen" written all over it.

1669
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:27,760
还是通红的
In blood.

1670
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,380
我们收到图像了 麦金尼先生
We get the picture, Mr. mckinney.

1671
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:33,770
别再坐我的椅子
And get out of my chair.

1672
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:35,720
大家好啊
Hello, everybody!

1673
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:37,770
靠近一点 来呀
Come close, come on!

1674
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:39,770
好的 好的 听着
All right, all right, so listen.

1675
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:43,570
今晚 我将利用真实的魔术
Tonight, I am going to make something fly

1676
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:45,400
飞起来
using actual magic.

1677
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,280
- 准备好了吗？ - 是的
- Are you ready?  - Yeah!

1678
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,360
我要利用一辆大型的船
I'm going to take a very large vessel,

1679
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:54,620
我要让它飞起来 然后在泰晤士河着陆
I'm gonna make it fly over there and land on the thames.

1680
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:56,620
你能接受吗？
Can you handle that?

1681
01:30:56,620 --> 01:30:58,330
和以前的规则一样
Same rules apply as before.

1682
01:30:58,330 --> 01:31:00,450
你们要做的就是仔细看着皇后
All you need to do is keep your eye on the queen.

1683
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:01,790
就那么简单
It's as simple as that.

1684
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,630
- 你们准备好了吗？ - 是的
- Are you guys ready?  - Yeah!

1685
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:06,460
爸爸 看看这个
Dad, look at this.

1686
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:09,630
- 这消息是从哪来的  - 河边 看来表演开始了
- Near the river.  - Looks like the shows are starting.

1687
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:11,630
但发现他们的不止我们
But we're not the only ones who found them.

1688
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:13,350
- 什么意思？ - 在一号频道
- What do you mean?  - It's on channel one.

1689
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,820
- 我们行动  - 找到了
- Let's go to.  - Here we go.

1690
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:25,520
找到他了 他在这
Got him. We have a location.

1691
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:27,520
是杰克·怀尔德 骑士出现了
It's Jack Wilder. Here come the horsemen.

1692
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:29,570
好的 行动 行动 行动
Okay, we're moving. Let's go, let's go.

1693
01:31:32,990 --> 01:31:35,740
- 正在比对  - 转身 藏在牌后面
- Turn around.  - Hide yourselves with the cards.

1694
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:38,540
我们开始了 交换
And here we go.

1695
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:42,380
你们还盯着她吗？
You guys still have your eye on her?

1696
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:43,380
要我去后面看看吗？
You want me to go back and do it?

1697
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,840
好的 我继续
Okay, all right. I'm moving on.

1698
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,500
交换
And switch.

1699
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,500
她在哪？
Where is she?

1700
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,850
那边 你们确定？
Down at the end? You sure?

1701
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:55,720
好的 后面的伙计 能击鼓吗？
All right, can I get a drumroll from my man in the back?

1702
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,350
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

1703
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:00,510
哦
Uh-oh.

1704
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:02,360
哦
Uh-oh.

1705
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:06,020
她在那
There's my girl.

1706
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,520
不是我的姑娘 是你的姑娘
Not my girl. 100% your girl.

1707
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,310
但在这样的情况下
But just in this situation.

1708
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,870
好的 但我得先暖暖场 好吗？
Okay, but I gotta warm up a little bit first. Okay?

1709
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:16,870
那么 我们先飞点小东西 比如…
So, uh, let me just make something small fly, like...

1710
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:18,990
飞飞飞
Fly, fly, fly!

1711
01:32:18,990 --> 01:32:20,820
对吧 看看啊
Wow, right? Look at that!

1712
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:22,630
拜托 伙计们
Aw. Come on, people.

1713
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:25,580
真无情 你 飞起来
Tough crowd. You, fly!

1714
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:26,790
- 我？ - 看看你的衣服里
- Me?  - Check your fly.

1715
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:31,880
你们喜欢吗？
You like that?

1716
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,890
你们接受这个设定
You support that relationship?

1717
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:36,850
那家伙的裤子里藏着鸽子 真是太恶心了
That guy had a bird in his pants. That's disgusting.

1718
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:42,600
收到 我们收到了两份报告
Copy that. We've got two sightings reported.

1719
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:45,600
- 正在前往格林威治市场  - 给我找撒迪厄斯
- Heading to greenwich market.  - Get me Thaddeus.

1720
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:47,900
撒迪厄斯 FBI来了 他们已经行动了
Thaddeus, the FBI are here. They're moving.

1721
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:49,650
让他们去吧
Let 'em move.

1722
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:52,860
- 让他们去斗吧  - 不能让骑士被他们找到
- Well, what if they get there first?  - That can't happen.

1723
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:55,030
我保证他们找不到的
I guarantee you, they won't.

1724
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:56,450
找到他们的所在
Find the pattern.

1725
01:32:57,370 --> 01:32:58,660
只有这样
You do that,

1726
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,740
你才能在它们开始
and you'll be able to cut them off

1727
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:02,750
最后的表演前阻止他们
before they get to their final trick.

1728
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:04,420
如果你想更放心的话
If it makes you feel better,

1729
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:06,580
我来替你摆平FBI
I'll take care of the FBI.

1730
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,390
我想你找到我了
I guess you found me!

1731
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,890
第三个找到了
We've got a third spot.

1732
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:26,560
好的 各位 我们有模型了
Okay, everybody, we're getting a pattern.

1733
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:30,770
调到二频道
Um... give me 2,

1734
01:33:32,030 --> 01:33:33,910
十三和二十一
13 and 21.

1735
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:35,990
那是什么？
What the hell is that?

1736
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:37,860
暂停 放大
Freeze that and zoom in.

1737
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:42,790
这是怎么回事？
How the hell did this happen?

1738
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:46,000
他死了 我们看着他沉下去 这怎么可能？
He's dead. We watched him drown. How the hell did this happen?

1739
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,410
现在就先接受现实 目前最首要的问题是
Given that it did happen, the pertinent question is,

1740
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:49,660
我们要怎么办？
what are we gonna do about it?

1741
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:51,080
我们要阻止他 爸爸 我们要阻止他
We're gonna stop him, dad. We'll stop him.

1742
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,760
我的外套在哪？
Where's my coat?

1743
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,590
沃尔特 恕我直言 我从来没看好过保险箱
Walter, for the record, i never loved the safe idea.

1744
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:57,090
我知道他们去哪了
Oh, I know where they're going.

1745
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,800
接下来的表演是梅里特的 地点就在河边
The next show is merritt's and it's by the river.

1746
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,440
我们得找到他 这样就能 找到骑士 并阻止他们之后的行动
So we can find the horsemen's entry point for the finale.

1747
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:10,560
我要忏悔
I've a confession to make.

1748
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,820
据说我有一些控制方面的问题
I've been told I have some control issues.

1749
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:16,150
我很努力的学着如何控制人
I've learned that it's really, really hard to control people,

1750
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:18,150
所以我将试着控制一些
so I'm gonna try to control something

1751
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:20,150
比人简单的多的东西
that's a lot easier than people.

1752
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:21,690
我要试着控制天气
I'm gonna try to control the weather.

1753
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:23,870
是的 雨水
Yeah, rain, um...

1754
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,750
要让天下雨有点困难 对吧？
It'd be a little difficult to make it rain, right?

1755
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:30,660
那是只有神能做到的事情 对吧？
That would be something that only god can do, right?

1756
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:32,960
我要做一些连神也做不到的事情
I'm gonna do something that god can't do.

1757
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:35,880
我不仅仅要让雨停
I'm not just gonna make it clear up. No, no, no.

1758
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:38,050
我要让它完全停止
I'm gonna make it actually stop.

1759
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:52,650
神能做到那些吗？
And can god do that?

1760
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:54,650
不 我想不能
Mmm. No, I don't think so.

1761
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:56,990
那么让它上升呢？
Or what about make it go up?

1762
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:06,700
你们还在看吗？
Are you still with me?

1763
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:08,620
看着 王后在左边 开始吧
Watch the queen on the left. Let's do it.

告诉我在哪
Show me the lady!

1768
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:23,220
这边 这边？
The end? End?

1769
01:35:25,770 --> 01:35:27,850
你知道吗？ 我开始觉得不太妙了
You know what? I'm actually starting to feel kinda bad.

1770
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:30,560
这是因为我能确实感受到
It's just because i can actually feel

1771
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,020
你们很专心 但是
that you guys are paying attention.

1772
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:36,530
你知道 很不幸的是 你们都错了
You know, it's unfortunate that it's the wrong kind of attention.

1773
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:40,940
是的 我们需要更新的鸟
Yeah, we need a fresher bird.

1774

Lula, stand by, all right?

1780
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,840

Or, what about just go, i don't know, just go insane?

1781
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,600
伦敦各地发来报告
Reports are coming in from all over London

1782
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:14,320
就好像骑士为了表演 接管了整座城市
as the horsemen appear to have taken over the whole city for their show.

1783
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:21,110

1809
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:28,340
不不不 那是我的举动

Because you're gonna need to know all of that for the final.

1814

那么 我是怎么做到的？
So how did I do it?

1815
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:42,650
我用了陷阱吗？
Did I use a Barry trap?

1816
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:44,280
也许是一些开关或者复制品？

骑士在哪？
Where the hell are the horsemen?

1829
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:35,000

You're just gonna wind up holding your own tails.

1830
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,830
或者你可以让他们 自己找上你们
Or, you can let them come to you.

追赶他们？
Chase them?

1833
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,050

1844
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,780
你是问他们 还是仅仅问我？
Have you asked the guys that question, or just me?

1845
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:08,860

Yeah, uh, take off immediately.

1895
01:42:41,490 --> 01:42:44,290
你知道 这事情太简单了
You know, you make it almost too easy?

1896
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:46,160
我是说 即使你们刷了些手段
I mean, even your hilarious attempts

1897
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:48,080
让你们的行踪不可捉摸
to make yourselves unpredictable,

1898
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,040
每次都让人找错
just follow the same pattern each time.

1899
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:52,090
建立 建立 建立
Set up, set up, set up.

1900
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:55,960
但今晚会是个不好的日子
Which tonight was going to be stroke of midnight,

1901
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:58,550
泰晤士河的中间？ 跟我说说吧
middle of the thames? Tell me if I'm warm.

1902
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:07,310
会有巨大揭露的 而且是马上上演
Well, there will be a big reveal, and it will come now.

1903
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:11,430
芯片 乖小子
The stick, dear boy.

1904
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:14,030
- 不  - 很好
- No.  - Fine.

1905
01:43:14,490 --> 01:43:16,690
从她开始
Start with her.

1906
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:19,190
嘿 嘿 嘿
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!

1907
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:24,700
- 给他  - 丹尼 把芯片给他
- Give it to him.  - Danny, give him the card.

1908
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:26,580
- 给他吧  - 丹尼 拜托
- Just give it to him.  - Danny, come on.

1909
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:37,710
我们得仔细看看
We'll have a closer look.

1910
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:48,350
好的 我欠你一个道歉
Okay, I owe you an apology.

1911
01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:50,180
领导 你应该计划逃脱 好吗？
Leader, you should have planned an escape, okay?

1912
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:52,360
- 这是我们两的事  - 好的 我们两的事
- This is the both of us.  - Okay, it's the both of us.

1913
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:54,020
- 各位 拜托  - 拜托 别吵了
- Guys, come on!  - Come on, stop!

1914
01:43:54,030 --> 01:43:55,730
你 我救了你的小女友
You, to save your little girlfriend!

1915
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:57,730
救了我的… 有人用刀逼着她
To save my... He had a knife to her head!

1916
01:43:57,730 --> 01:43:59,230
我是骑士之一 你这混蛋
I'm a horseman, you dick!

1917
01:43:59,230 --> 01:44:00,520
好的 知道吗？ 现在不适合说这个
All right, you know what? This is not the time!

1918
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:02,120
还有你 你到底瞒着什么？
And you, what's your deal, man?

1919
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:03,370
听着 我们根本不会流血
Look, they're not gonna get blood

1920
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:05,700
他们也许只会 把我们从飞机上丢下去
they're probably gonna throw us out of the plane.

1921
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:07,410
- 是吗？ - 很抱歉打断你们
- Really?  - I'm sorry to interrupt,

1922
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:09,580
但是我得说恭喜你们
but I just have to say congratulations.

1923
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:10,790
谢谢你们
And thank you!

1924
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:13,630
是真的
It's real.

1925
01:44:13,630 --> 01:44:15,250
什么？
What?

1926
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:16,710
是真的？
It's real?

1927
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:19,500
把他们带过来
Bring them through.

1928
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:20,670
你说那是真的？
Did you say it's real?

1929
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:21,710
他什么意思？
What is he talking about?

1930
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:23,140
走
Move!

1931
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:24,600
干的好 孩子
Well done, my boy.

1932
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:31,100
度玛丽苏香槟
Cote du marisule champagne.

1933
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:33,730
这是地球上
It's the most expensive bottle

1934
01:44:33,730 --> 01:44:35,230
最贵的一瓶了
on earth.

1935
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:38,270
一百二十万美金
$1.2 million.

1936
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:42,320
这是我特意为现在准备的
And I saved it just for this occasion.

1937
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:46,160
说实话你这酒最多值个七万
Honestly, same bottle, liquor shack, 700k.

1938
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:48,410
嘿
Hey.

1939
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:49,740
你得到了你想要的
You got what you wanted.

1940
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:52,460
那么 你愿意放了我们？
So, does this mean you're letting us go?

1941
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:55,460
根据你对我们的了解 我们不会放人
Knowing what you know about us? No.

1942
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:56,630
你确定？
You sure?

1943
01:44:56,630 --> 01:44:58,630
沙斯 我们该怎么办？
Chase, what shall we do?

1944
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:03,180
把他们扔出去
Toss them out.

1945
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:05,430
大家快速说遗言吧
Get your last words in quickly, everybody!

1946
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,640
不 拜托 不要
No! Come on! No!

1947
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:10,680
永别了
Farewell.

1948
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:13,690
天啊 不
Oh, god! No!

1949
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:17,400
等等 我只想说
Wait! I just wanna say.

1950
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,650
我投胎投错了家庭
I came into the world with the wrong family,

1951
01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:21,730
但我遇到了正确的朋友们
but I'm leaving with the right one.

1952
01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:23,450
我爱你们
I love you guys!

1953
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:24,530
不不不
No! No, no, no!

1954
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,740
我就是这样把你踢出来的
This is how I kicked you out of the womb.

1955
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:29,870
不
No!

1956
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:32,750
下一个是谁？
Who's next?

1957
01:45:38,830 --> 01:45:40,790
不 等等 放开我
No, wait! Let me go!

1958
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:43,300
放开我
Let go of me!

1959
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:44,720
不 不 不
No, no, no!

1960
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:47,180
- 放开我  - 把她扔出去
- Let me go!  - Toss her!

1961
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:52,730
我的天
Oh, god!

1962
01:45:52,730 --> 01:45:54,190
赶紧搞定 把门关上
Hurry up and shut that door!

1963
01:45:54,190 --> 01:45:55,810
这里面好冷
It's getting cold in here.

1964
01:45:55,810 --> 01:45:57,810
好的 上路了 杰克
Okay, hit the road, Jack!

1965
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,530
不不不
No, no, no!

1966
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:08,280
头脑发达 四肢简单
A lot of brain, but not enough brawn.

1967
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:12,920
真有趣
Oh, that was fun!

1968
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:17,410
干杯
Cheers!

1969
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:18,830
干的好 我的孩子
Well done, my boy.

1970
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:24,720
嗯…
Um...

1971
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,920
不 真是那味道吗？
No, is it supposed to taste like that?

1972
01:46:26,930 --> 01:46:28,590
不 不是的
No, it is not.

1973
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,900
到底怎么回事？
What the hell is going on?

1974
01:46:59,870 --> 01:47:01,580
好的 来接他们吧
Okay, come pick them up!

1975
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:04,590
- 快点  - 快出来
- Come on.  - Come on out.

1976
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:19,560
女士们先生们…
Ladies and gentlemen...

1977
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,770
四骑士
The horsemen!

1978
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:44,460
不 你应该感觉很好的 伙计
No, you should feel pretty good about yourself, man.

1979
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:45,750
你预料的很正确
You predicted it correctly.

1980
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,000
泰晤士河 午夜时分
The thames, stroke of midnight.

1981
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:49,920
除夕夜 新年快乐
New year's Eve. Happy new year!

1982
01:47:56,890 --> 01:47:59,640
- 难以置信 都变了  - 我们正在行动
- We are moving now.  - The whole thing just changed.

1983
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:02,480
- 后备待命  - 开始行动
- All backup into position stat!  - We're on the move.

1984
01:48:03,820 --> 01:48:04,940
你留在这
You're staying here!

1985
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:05,980
当然了
Of course.

1986
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:15,450
行动 行动 让开
Move! Move! Out of the way!

1987
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:17,660
非常感谢 伦敦
Wow! Thank you very much, London!

1988
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:20,580
我们不仅要感谢我们的老朋友
We would like to acknowledge not just our old friend

1989
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:24,670
还有他年轻而帅气的儿子沃尔特·马布里
but his young and very brilliant son, Walter mabry.

1990
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:27,340
他很好的进行了一场
Who has performed one of the greatest feats of illusion

1991
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:28,880
在我们看来十分优秀的催眠表演
even we have ever seen.

1992
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:33,300
他难以置信的死而复生了
He has, amazingly, brought himself back from the dead!

1993
01:48:33,310 --> 01:48:35,890
但是在他做这些之前
But before he did that,

1994
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:37,430
他揭秘了一些人
he revealed someone.

1995
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:40,350
我想我们有权利给他
And we think it only right to give him

1996
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:42,610
一个适当的介绍
a proper introduction.

1997
01:48:42,610 --> 01:48:45,480
他是我们的朋友和领袖
He is our friend and he is our leader.

1998
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:46,690
迪连 伯劳
Dylan shrike!

1999
01:48:46,690 --> 01:48:48,690
- 过来  - 是的
- Get over here!  - Yeah!

2000
01:48:54,580 --> 01:48:56,700
那么 一般来说
So, normally

2001
01:48:56,700 --> 01:49:01,530
只有魔术师本人 他的助手 以及几个舞台助手
only the magician, his assistant, and a few trusted stage hands

2002
01:49:01,530 --> 01:49:03,710
知道一个把戏的秘密
know the secret of a trick.

2003
01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:06,790
但是今晚 在这样的影响下
But tonight, however, in this effect,

2004
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:09,920
在泰晤士河附近的人们
all of you people around the thames here.

2005
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:12,010
因为我们还活着
And since we're streaming live,

2006
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:14,720
所以世界各地的人们
everyone around the world

2007
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:17,390
都知道了一切
already knows everything.

2008
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:21,510
只有站在那边的伙计们还不明白
And only these fellows here are the ones left in the dark.

2009
01:49:21,510 --> 01:49:24,520
所以我们就让你们 见识一下我们的表演
So let's see how closely you were watching our shows.

2010
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:27,650
记得当我们在表演“找小姐”的时候
Remember when we were playing "find the lady."

2011
01:49:27,650 --> 01:49:29,730
我说过我们用了陷阱
I said that we used a Barry trap.

2012
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:34,660
一些经典的转换和副本？
Some classic switches and a few duplicates?

2013
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:38,120
所以我们换了卡车的司机
Well, that's how we switched the driver of the truck.

2014
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:43,540
然后我们进了早就 设计好的飞机库
Which took us to a duplicate hangar

2015
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:45,830
我们利用你们的着急
where we used your need to rush,

2016
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:49,420
以及怕被发现的心里 配合我们的工作
and your fear of being seen let you do the work for us.

2017
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:50,710
不要用灯照着我
Get those lights off me!

2018
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:54,550
那么 那架飞机
So, the airplane.

2019
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:56,140
我们怎么让它飞起来的？
How did we get it to fly?

2020
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,760
我们利用的是风扇
Well, we used fans,

2021
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,650
还有灯光和造雨机
and lights and rain machines.

2022
01:50:07,770 --> 01:50:12,570
很明显 这一切的前提就是 我们得被你们抓住
Obviously, all of this was reliant on us getting caught.

2023
01:50:12,570 --> 01:50:15,990
但是我们得确保你们抓住我们后
That you would do exactly what we needed you to do

2024
01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:17,610
完全按照我们的安排来
once you did catch us.

2025
01:50:17,610 --> 01:50:19,490
我的弟弟沙斯
My brother chase,

2026
01:50:19,490 --> 01:50:23,790
他是失败队伍的技术顾问
who was technical adviser to the losing team.

2027
01:50:23,790 --> 01:50:26,580
这只是关于盲点的问题
He taught us that it's all about blind spots.

2028
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:28,120
我知道你要去哪
I know where you're going!

2029
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:31,830
还有 惊喜
And, uh, surprises.

2030
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:35,090
小心点 伙计
Watch it, hobo.

2031
01:50:35,090 --> 01:50:36,840
为何你不看着我戴的手表
Why don't you watch the watch I'm wearing,

2032
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:39,720
然后睡过去
the where of where you're watching, and sleep!

2033
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:41,760
你要把骑士们
It's going to be your idea to throw the horsemen

2034
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,100
从飞机里扔出去
out of the plane.

2035
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:45,430
如果你还感到迷惑不解
If all of this is kind of confusing to you,

2036
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,730
我可以之后向你解释
I can maybe catch you up on it later.

2037
01:50:47,730 --> 01:50:50,140
怎么说呢？也许我们 过个三五年就见到了？
Probably see you what, three to five?

2038
01:50:51,190 --> 01:50:53,440
来吧 击掌吧
Come on, put it there.

2039
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:54,900
嘿 以牙还牙 兄弟
Hey! Tit for tat, bro!

2040
01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:59,150
基本上 我们让他们知道了一切
Basically, we showed them everything.

2041
01:50:59,150 --> 01:51:04,660
你们如何绑架我们 以及偷窃在你口袋里的芯片
To steal the very thing that is in your pocket right now.

2042
01:51:06,710 --> 01:51:08,040
哎呦！
Whoops!

2043
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:14,210
你知道 这个东西
You know, this thing here,

2044
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:17,590
也就是你所说的可以 用来整顿市场
which you said you could use to adjust markets,

2045
01:51:17,590 --> 01:51:19,170
操纵政府
manipulate governments,

2046
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:26,140
- 监视任何人的东西  - 还有你说的可以控制民众的东西
also, you could, as you said control the public from outside the grid.

2047
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:32,980
这些人杀人害命
These men destroy people's lives.

2048
01:51:32,990 --> 01:51:37,030
监视整个世界 侵犯你们的隐私权
Spying on the world, robbing you of your right to privacy.

2049
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:40,530
他们藏在黑暗中做着这一切
And they do that by hiding in the dark.

2050
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:45,040
所以 根据骑士的传统 我们要揭发它们
So, in the horsemen tradition, we're here to expose them.

2051
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,000
今晚 他们
Tonight, they,

2052
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:50,160
和我们大家一样
like all of us,

2053
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:53,050
终于站到了光亮处
are finally stepping into the light.

2054
01:51:57,510 --> 01:52:00,840
谢谢大家 我们是骑士 我们很快会再见
We are the horsemen and we will be back very soon!

2055
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:05,930
五 四 三
Five, four, three,

2056
01:52:05,930 --> 01:52:07,640
二 一
two, one!

2057
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,990
嘿 我们赶时间 快走
Hey, we're on the clock. Get a move on.

2058
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:33,290
- 里面还有更多  - 你别碰我
- There's more inside.  - Don't you bloody touch me!

2059
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:35,090
骑士们就在…
The horsemen are over on the...

2060
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:39,300
见鬼
Oh, shit!

2061
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,880
你呆在这
Stay with them!

2062
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:43,930
所有人散开
Everybody spread out!

2063
01:52:43,930 --> 01:52:45,890
都别离开驳船
Nobody leaves this barge!

2064
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:50,890
罗兹 站住 不许动
Rhodes, hold it right there! Do not move!

2065
01:52:56,570 --> 01:52:58,150
这里面包含了一切
This contains everything.

2066
01:52:58,150 --> 01:53:01,270
不仅仅是沃尔特和特拉斯勒的事 还有他们所有的交易
Not just Walter and tressler, but all their dealings.

2067
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:04,320
他们所有的联系人 整个的生意网络
All their contacts, the entire network.

2068
01:53:04,330 --> 01:53:06,740
我为什么要相信你？
And why on earth would I believe you?

2069
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:08,570
我告诉过你
I told you.

2070
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:10,570
我一直都是那样的人
I'm the same man I've always been.

2071
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:13,000
快走 快点 走走走
Move it! Come on! Let's go, go, go!

2072
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,830
我不是这个组织的一部分 我是梅里特
I'm not part of this organization! I'm merritt.

2073
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:18,130
我被骗了 我被骗了
I'm a patsy! I'm a patsy!

2074
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,250
十分钟
10 minutes.

2075
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,890
现在轮到你玩了
Now you're playing the long game.

2076
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:41,980
爸爸 我保证我会处理好的
Dad, I promise you I will fix this.

2077
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:44,320
你不行 别再叫我爸爸
You can't. Stop calling me dad.

2078
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:48,360
我上过的女人太多了 根本不知道你是谁的
There were so many women, i have no idea whose bastard you are.

2079
01:53:48,370 --> 01:53:52,040
- 怎么回事？ - 不见了 跟我来
- What happened?  - Thin air, gone. Come with me.

2080
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:53,870
你说不见了是什么意思？
What're you talking about, gone?

2081
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:55,830
活人可没法就这样消息
People don't just disappear.

2082
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:58,670
你应该知道他根本不会魔术
You realize that he doesn't actually have magical powers!

2083
01:54:38,170 --> 01:54:39,750
嘿 各位 嘿
Hey, guys. Hey!

2084
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:42,130
- 见到你们真好  - 见到你真好 李
- Good to see you all.  - Good to see you, li.

2085
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:44,380
进来吧
Come on in.

2086
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,010
早上好
Good morning.

2087
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:50,430
欢迎
Welcome.

2088
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:54,850
我为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

2089
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:56,390
为你们骄傲
All of you.

2090
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:58,890
我有很多事要告诉你
I have a lot to show you.

2091
01:54:58,890 --> 01:55:00,100
来吧
Come.

2092
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:02,450
来吧
Come.

2093
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:15,120
爸爸
Dad.

2094
01:55:32,430 --> 01:55:34,180
是的
Yes.

2095
01:55:34,180 --> 01:55:37,060
你父亲和我曾是搭档
Your father and i were partners.

2096
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:40,230
我们的表演充满竞争力
Our act was that of rivals.

2097
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:44,280
我是个坚定的现实主义者
I was the hard-eyed realist.

2098
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:47,110
而他是爱做梦的理想主义者
He was the dreamy-eyed idealist.

2099
01:55:47,110 --> 01:55:49,940
我们认为那是最好的组合
We thought it was the perfect misdirect.

2100
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:54,790
是的 在公开场合 我刺激他
Yes, in public, i did goad him.

2101
01:55:54,790 --> 01:55:56,750
只是我们当时没想到
The only thing we didn't count on

2102
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,370
事情会闹得这么大
was it going so wrong.

2103
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:05,300
为何？
Why?

2104
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:07,210
为何你从来不和我说？
Why didn't you ever say anything to me?

2105
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:08,880
我不知道
I don't know.

2106
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,250
你想吧
Give it a name.

2107
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:13,310
因为羞耻 内疚
Shame, guilt.

2108
01:56:13,310 --> 01:56:14,810
后悔
Regret.

2109
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:21,390
嘿 各位 你们也许想看看这个
Hey, guys, uh, you might wanna come take a look at this.

2110
01:56:23,110 --> 01:56:24,190
喔…
Hmm.

2111
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:26,980
看啊
Look.

2112
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:28,820
我把你送进监狱了 伙计
I put you in jail, man.

2113
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:31,190
你当时为何不说些什么？
Why didn't you say something then?

2114
01:56:31,190 --> 01:56:34,330
你知道 我本来要说的
Well, you know, i was going to.

2115
01:56:34,330 --> 01:56:38,330
但你之后很快表现出了动机
But then, you were so quick to show your personal motivations that...

2116
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,000
说实话
Well, quite frankly

2117
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,790
我被骗到了
it spoiled the trick for me.

2118
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,130
我表现出了我的弱点
I showed my weakness.

2119
01:56:45,130 --> 01:56:48,000
这证明你没准备好
Well, it showed you weren't ready.

2120
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,790
但是当你回到我的牢房
But when you came back to my cell,

2121
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:54,850
你就已经放下了你对我 长达三十年的仇恨
you had let go of your 30-year vendetta against me

2122
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,470
为了你的骑士
for your horsemen.

2123
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:01,850
然后我对自己说
And I said to myself,

2124
01:57:01,850 --> 01:57:03,940
“那才是莱昂内尔的孩子”
"that's Lionel's boy."

2125
01:57:04,570 --> 01:57:07,190
于是我就知道
And I knew it was my job

2126
01:57:07,190 --> 01:57:12,030
见证他成为一名伟大的 魔术师是我的责任
to see to it that he became the magician he was born to be.

2127
01:57:12,030 --> 01:57:14,370
所以剩下的就是…
All that was left then was...

2128
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:17,410
让我知道真相
For me to hit bottom.

2129
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:19,490
那么那保险箱
So the safe,

2130
01:57:19,490 --> 01:57:21,450
我父亲的手表
my father's wristwatch,

2131
01:57:21,450 --> 01:57:23,130
都是你安排的？
that was all you?

2132
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:29,210
沃尔特和特拉斯勒也包括在内？
Walter and tressler, were they in on it too?

2133
01:57:29,210 --> 01:57:32,180
我们知道沃尔特藏起来了
Oh, we knew Walter was in hiding.

2134
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:36,010
演出只是为了让 公众知道他的存在
The octa show was a setup to expose him to the public.

2135
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:41,300
你对于骑士的想法是对的
And you were right about the horsemen.

2136
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:46,230
他们得学会像个 有机的整体一样合作
They needed to learn to work together like a single organism.

2137
01:57:53,950 --> 01:57:56,530
现在我知道 你为何看来如此眼熟了
Now I know why you look so familiar.

2138
01:57:56,530 --> 01:57:58,120
你是骑士 对吧？
You're the horsemen, aren't you?

2139
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:09,540
但是事情不可能这么简单
But that can't be what all this is about.

2140
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,540
你知道 最好的戏法
You know, the best tricks

2141
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:14,090
有着很多的标准
work on many levels.

2142
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:16,010
其中最高深的一层
And the deepest one,

2143
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:18,130
至少对我来说
for me, at least,

2144
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:21,010
就是此时此刻
is this moment right here.

2145
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:26,100
我很抱歉 迪连
I'm sorry, Dylan.

2146
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:29,270
我想念你父亲
I miss your father.

2147
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:32,990
三十年的时间可不短 对吧？
30 years is a long time to drag something around, isn't it?

2148
01:58:32,990 --> 01:58:34,570
是的 没错
Yes, it is.

2149
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:45,960
那么 现在怎么办？
So, now what?

2150
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:51,210
现在我想退休了
Now I'm about out of moves. Oh...

2151
01:58:51,210 --> 01:58:55,050
- 我累了  - 拜托 你可是说过要把
Come on, you're the one who said that you believe that this road

2152
01:58:55,050 --> 01:58:56,970
那些伟大的戏法破解的
lead to the great wizard behind the curtain.

2153
01:58:56,970 --> 01:59:01,220
然后无愧于他
And that you'd finally get to look him in the eyes.

2154
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:03,390
是的
I am.

2155
01:59:09,190 --> 01:59:11,640
现在到你了
It's your game now.

2156
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:14,400
随你怎么去做
You play it however you see fit.

2157
01:59:15,530 --> 01:59:17,990
但我还是建议
My suggestion, however,

2158
01:59:17,990 --> 01:59:21,490
你给自己找个继承人
is that you find yourself a successor.

2159
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:23,450
嗨 好的 那么…
Hi. Okay, so, um...

2160
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:25,620
显然我们有些问题
Well, obviously, we have a few questions.

2161
01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:27,580
对吧？
Right?

2162
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:29,410
他说的几个大概指的是五百万个
Uh... by "a few," i think he means, like, five million.

2163
01:59:29,410 --> 01:59:31,120
- 是的  - 好吧
- Yeah.  - Well.

2164
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:33,050
祝你们好运
Good luck to you all.

2165
01:59:33,050 --> 01:59:34,630
- 什么  - 好的 看到没 那不公平
- What!  - Okay. See, that's not fair.

2166
01:59:34,630 --> 01:59:35,960
- 拜托  - 那样不对
Come on. That's not right.

2167
01:59:35,970 --> 01:59:37,210
那样我会很生气的
That's gonna make me really angry!

2168
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:38,460
现在不行

哦 对了…

那里有幕布

这取决于你的立场

你们在听吗 骑士们？

只是过程让你们无法预料

但那是你们应得的

因为我相信一件事

2185
02:00:32,570 --> 02:00:34,610
以眼还眼

2186
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:36,530
以牙还牙
for an eye.
