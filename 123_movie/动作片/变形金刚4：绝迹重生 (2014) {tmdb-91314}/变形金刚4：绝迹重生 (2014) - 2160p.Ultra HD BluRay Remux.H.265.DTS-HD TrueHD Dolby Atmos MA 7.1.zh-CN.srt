上头坚持要我们继续运作，不能停工
Corporate was adamant. We keep running. No stopping operations.

No, no, no. You got to go through. No cameras.

He's got orders to kill. I don't even think international laws apply up here.

如果这些东西具历史意义
If this thing has any historical significance at all,

11
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,050
我们就得停止运作，我说了算
we are shutting down. I'm shutting us down.

12

他要开枪射我吗？开抢啊
Oh, he's going to shoot me? Shoot me.

别杀她
Hey, don't kill her.

14
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,690
真得很夸张
This is crazy stuff.

15
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,380
不知道是什么
Crazy shit.

16

你有什么看法？
Well, what do you think?

Oh, look who decided to show up for work.

23
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,860
我总是令人心碎
I'm a heart breaker

Granddaddy ran it all his life. Ain't that right, Granddaddy?

00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,620
他很快就会把这里转让给我
Real soon he's going to sign it over to me.

Hey, heads!

58
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,860
你就是这样才选不上校队
That's why you didn't make the varsity team.

看我这记长传
All right. Go long.

Leave it.

你到底经历过什么事？
What the hell happened to you?

63
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,950
小子，这辆卡车多少钱？
Hey, snake balls. How much for the truck?

never again can we allow aliens to fight our battles for us.

88
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,670
联合作战行动中止之后
A handful of Autobots were given sanctuary

89
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,550
幸存的汽车人获得了安置

Hey, I've been waiting for you.

104

你穿的好辣！
You're looking hot today!

105
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,720
是吗？你把上衣脱掉给我看看
Oh, yeah? How about you take your shirt off?

106
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,820
万一被你爸看到怎么办？你要去哪？
You want me to take my shirt off right now? What would your dad think of that?

107
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,240
真不敢相信，太夸张了
- What the hell? - Hey, where you going? I cannot believe him. I cannot believe this.

108
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,160
搞什么？
What the hell?

109
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,830
继续往前！
All the way!

110
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,490
卡车？爸，你该不会砸了钱在这卡车上吧？
A truck? Dad, please tell me you didn't spend our money on this.

111
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,230
别担心，他花的是我的钱，共150美元
Oh, no, don't worry, he didn't. He spent my money.

112
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,200
这会加在你的薪水里
A hundred and fifty bucks of it. As an advance on your regular paycheck.

113
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,240
什么薪水？  - 你很快就会拿到
- What regular paycheck? - Which you will get back.

- When? - Never. We're broke.

115
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,540
我就知道
I knew it.

116
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,670
亲爱的，你不要在老板和员工之间挑拨离间
Sweetheart, could you please not drive a wedge

117
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,460
我们不是合伙人吗？
between employer and employee. Hold on. I thought we were partners.

118
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,380
我手头紧，钱都花在她的礼服上了
Look, I came up short, okay? I had to buy her a prom dress.

119
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,050
毕业舞会能没有礼服吗？
You want me to deny her a prom dress?

120
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,970
那你就可以不让她找舞伴？
You might as well. You denied her a prom date.

121
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,810
我会陪她去所以她不需要
No, I offered to take her and chaperone.

122
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,560
谁会想带老爸去舞会？超怪的
Nobody wants to go to the dance with their dad. It's weird.

123
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,450
问题不在这  - 或许这就是问题
It's not the issue. Well, maybe it should be.

124
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,330
别再呛我，你们知道这引擎多值钱吗？
Hey. Could you guys Just get Off my case? You know what the engine on this runs for?

125
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,170
我会拆零件散卖
I can break it down and strip it for parts.

126
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,000
亲爱的，你的裤子愈缩愈短了
And sweetheart, your shorts are shrinking by the second, okay?

127
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,800
拜托用冷水洗再风干
Cold water, air dry, please.

128
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,350
我觉得这样很性感
I think she looks hot.

129
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,890
你说什么？
What did you say?

130
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,480
性感的少女
Like a hot teenager.

131
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,150
加上"少女"没有比较好，谢谢
Oh, it's the "teenager" thing that makes it better. Thank you.

132
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,780
我不是这个意思啦
It didn't sound like what it meant.

133
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,080
放到电路板那边
That goes by the circuit boards.

134
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,090
把蔡司镜片放在那里
Put the Zeiss lenses over there.

135
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,390
爸，拜托别再花钱买废物
Dad, please. You can't keep spending money on junk

136
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,470
然后拆散它们变成更多废物
just so you can turn it into different junk.

137
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,480
这里没有东西是废物
We do not use the "J" word in here.

138
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,980
这古董放映机稀有得很
That is a Super Simplex theater projector. It's very rare.

139
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,280
这个"微笑领航员"不错吧？
What about the Smile Pilot?

140
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,990
还有"除草运动机"都是划时代的发明
Or the Exer-Mower that I invented? Simply ahead of their time.

141
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,790
就跟那只没路用的看门狗一样
Yeah, like the alleged Guard-Dawg.

142
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,460
你惹到它了
You're gonna get him upset.

143
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,380
凯德！
Hey, Cade! Cade!

144
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,050
这东西还能用吗？
This thing still work?

145
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,390
才怪！  - 当然，前无古人的产品
- No! - Yes. Yes, and still groundbreaking.

146
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,620
你尽管躺好等它送冰啤酒来
Go back there and lay on the recliner and just wait for a cold one.

147
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,490
老兄，别再弄坏东西
Dude, stop breaking stuff.

148
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,710
各式各样的催缴单
Final notice, late notice, past due.

149
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,420
过来，快过来
Come on, come on.

150
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,090
把啤酒拿过来
Bring Daddy the alcohol. Come on.

151
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,890
这些是什么鬼东西？
I mean, what is all this crap people send you?

152
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,890
CD随身听和匣式录音带
That's a Discman and that's an 8-track tape.

153
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,860
听音乐用的  - 从没听说过
- Music. - Never heard of it.

154
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,360
那个修好可以卖100，这个250
Look, I fix that, it's 100 bucks. I fix that, it's $250.

155
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,480
那个如果没被你摔坏可以卖20块
If I would have been able to fix that before you broke it even more, it would have been 20 bucks.

156
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,670
这些钱再加上奖学金就能供你上大学
This stuff is what's gonna put you through college, as long as you land one of those scholarships.

157
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,590
等它拿过来要多久？
What's the estimated time of arrival, usually? Average?

158
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,860
所以它只会把啤酒拿到附近，就这样？
Wait. So it just brings the beer near you? That's the trick?

159
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,280
一两个小瑕疵别在意  - 没错
- It's got a couple kinks, man. - Yeah.

160
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,030
爸，你不觉得有些东西根本不该被发明吗？
Dad, you think maybe some things should never be invented?

161
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,740
不，你那是落伍的想法
No, I don't. That's backwards thinking.

162
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,290
这里是很神圣的科技殿堂
This is a temple of technology. You guys are standing in a holy place.

163
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,880
怎么样？你们看一下这片土地
What do you think? Why don't you look at all of this?

164
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,260
这都可以是你们的，不错吧？
This could be yours. What about this land?

165
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,270
紫衣大妈又来乱了
Purple People Eater's back and she looks hungry.

166
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,020
很棒对不对？
Isn't this incredible?

167
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,690
我就知道你们会喜欢
- I knew you would like it. - Hey, you!

168
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,530
这房子是我的！我不会卖！
I own this house! It's not for sale!

169
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,830
伊格先生，你已经六个月没缴房贷
Six months late on payments, Mr. Yeager.

170
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,950
你还偷接电线杆的电
And I see you stealing power at the pole.

171
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,620
不关你的事
Hey, that's not your concern.

172
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,130
你们想参观一下吗？  - 当然
- Sir, do you wanna see the property? - Sure.

173
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,670
我来带你们逛逛
I'd be more than happy to give you a tour.

174
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,640
先去看我埋的其他买家
I'll show you three other buyers I got buried out back,

175
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,180
然后再打爆你们的头！
then I'll crack your head open like an egg!

176
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,190
我警告过你别再来
I told you don't come back here anymore.

177
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,070
我要叫我哥来扁你一顿！
I will have my brother come back and beat your ass!

178
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,610
我还会叫警察！我老哥你惹不起！
and I'll bring the police when I come, too! - My brother ain't no joke!

179
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,160
你说杰瑞？
Who, Jerry?

180
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,130
他肥到光是下个车就快断气了
You bring his big ass up here, he's gonna be huffing and puffing before he can squeeze out of that car!

181
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,670
你敢把车开上草皮你就死定了！
You back out on my grass, you're gonna be in big trouble!

182
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,210
叫杰瑞来找我啊
You tell Jerry to come see me.

183
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,430
我会请他吃胡桃派
I'll give him some pecan pie.

184
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,940
她竟敢撞我围篱！
She smashed through the fence?

185
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,910
放轻松啦，你都快气到脑肌梗塞了
Cade, relax. You're going to have an aortic infarction.

186
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,900
什么鬼病？  - 脑的心脏病吧
What is that? I think it's a brain heart attack.

187
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,330
我已经发过了
Yeah, I've had one already.

188
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,580
我们现在还偷电？
So we're stealing power now?

189
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,170
只是跟邻居借一下
No, we're borrowing it from the neighbors.

190
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,510
你也太扯了
Great. That's awesome.

191
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,260
我毕业离家后谁来照顾你？
Once I graduate and I'm gone, who's gonna take care of you?

192
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,850
你在照顾我？
Oh, you take care of me?

193
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,850
是谁教你焊接技术？
Who taught you how to solder a circuit?

194
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,030
是谁教你写程式？还有梳头发？
Or write a program? Or French braid your hair?

195
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,200
丢螺旋球？都是我教你的
Or throw a spiral? Me. That's what I do.

196
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,910
谁教你不用番茄酱煮饭和记帐？
Who taught you how to cook without ketchup, or balance your checkbook?

197
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,750
谁总是扮演成熟的大人？
Who always has to be the grownup around here?

198
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,180
你说的有理，但这表示我们合作无间
All right, you got a point, okay? But that means we're a great team.

199
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,770
我知道最近家里状况不太好
And I know it's been sucky around here lately.

200
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,520
但我们会没事的，要保持信念
But we're gonna be fine, sweetie. You just gotta keep believing, okay?

201
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,190
伟大的发明家都这样
I mean, that's what great inventors do.

202
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,870
我保证将来一定会发明出有用的东西
I promise you, one day, I'm gonna build something that matters.

203
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,710
我相信你，爸
I believe you, Dad.

204
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,670
你妈妈会以你为荣
You know, your mom would be very proud of you.

205
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,100
一切都会没事的
It's going to be okay.

206
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,540
散开！向右推进！
Spread out! Push right!

207
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,120
这里需要两个人
Roll, roll, roll, roll. Give me two. Give me two.

208
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,260
守好岸边，小心慢慢来
Take the beach, nice and easy.

209
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,260
留在原地
All right, hold what you got.

210
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,730
启动迷你空拍机
Release the mini-drones.

211
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,440
"墓风部队"

212
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,100
这是毒蛇，看见老鹰了，准备开火
Vipers. Eagle in sight. Cleared hot.

213
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,520
有热源，船首数过来第二根烟囱
Got a heat sig. Second stack. Closest to the bow.

214
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,110
掠夺者01，瞄准目标区域

216
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,130
队长，这是枪手01
Leader, leader, this is Gunfighter 0-1.

217
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,880
老鹰进入室内
Eagles moving internal. Second deck.

218
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,520
蛙人83，蛙人83
Frogman 83, Frogman 83.

219
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,560
已进入最上层，已进入最上层
Breached site on rooftop. - Breached site on rooftop. - Have Echo Platoon on standby.

220
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,240
让直升机知道我们要出来了！
Let the halo know we're moving external!

221
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,040
A队往左舷推进，B队负责右舷
Alpha, take port. Bravo, take starboard.

222
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,920
往右
Shift right. Shift right.

223
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,100
攻击目标！
Cracking steel!

224
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,450
不要！
No!

225
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,080
攻击他！
Hit him, hit him, hit him!

226
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,840
开火
Fire.

227
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,170
飞弹已发射，危险勿近
Missiles out. Danger close.

228
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,930
他要逃走了！追上去！
He's running! Move!

229
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,270
他逃走了！大家追上去！
He's on the run! He's on the run!

230
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,800
拜托！不要！
No! Please!

231
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,560
别开枪
Hold your fire.

232
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,190
别开枪！
Hold! Hold fire!

233
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,530
你们没看到我受伤了吗？
Can you not see'? I've been injured.

234
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,660
包围他，包围他
Box him in. Box him in.

235
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,540
我是医官飞轮！我是你们的盟友！
Medical Officer Ratchet! I'm a friend!

236
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,550
我是汽车人！
I'm an Autobot!

237
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,470
那你为什么要逃？
Then why are you running?

238
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,230
擎天柱发出这个紧急讯息
Optimus sent this distress message.

239
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,190
呼叫所有汽车人
Calling all Autobots.

240
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,990
我们成为攻击目标了
We are under targeted attack.

241
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,240
不要再与人类有任何联系
Cease all contact with humans.

242
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,660
所以我们躲了起来
We're all hiding.

243
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,670
所有汽车人都被追杀
All Autobots are being hunted.

244
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,500
情况非常危险
We're all in danger.

245
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,420
我在芝加哥之役失去了妹妹
I lost a sister in Chicago.

246
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,760
我一点都不同情你
You'll get no sympathy from me.

247
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,500
你们人类到底有什么毛病？
What's wrong with you humans?

248
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
不！不要...
No! Please.

249
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,530
停火！停火！
Check fire, check fire!

250
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,470
由我来了结他
He's mine now.

251
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,810
地狱猎人...
Lock down.

252
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,650
汽车人，霸天虎
Autobots, Decepticons.

253
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,120
像小孩一样只会打架
Like little children, always fighting.

254
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,000
闹得整个宇宙不得安宁
Making a mess out of the universe.

255
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,630
还得由我来擦屁股
Then I've got to clean it up.

256
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,190
想活命就告诉我他藏在哪里
There is one way you survive. Tell me where he's hiding.

257
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,600
擎天柱在哪？
Where is Optimus Prime?

258
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,400
我死也不说
Never.

259
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,170
那你就去死吧
Never is here.

260
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,780
真令人印象深刻
I must say, it is remarkable,

261
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,280
自从你接管了中情局之后...
really astounding, the success that the CIA has had

262
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,260
...表现亮眼，因此总统要我来问你...
since you have taken operational control, and so the President has asked me to ask you

263
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,000
...也问他...
to ask him,

264
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,400
...愿不愿意去白宫一趟...
to invite you both over to the White House just to powwow,

265
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:52,020
跟我们报告更多...
where we get maybe some more specifics about how

266
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,030
...你们追杀霸天虎余党的细节
exactly you're hunting the enemy Decepticons left.

267
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,910
我当局长两年了，而艾汀杰先生已经任职了25年
I've had my desk for two years. Mr. Attinger has been here for 25.

268
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,880
他的案子我从不过问细节
He runs the projects where I don't ask for specifics.

269
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,210
所以才叫秘密行动
That's why they're called Black Ops.

270
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,640
所以我们晚上才能睡得安稳
And why we all sleep better at night.

271
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,220
了解，很好，可是...
Check. That is great. So, um...

272
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,240
可以透露一点吗？你们进行得如何？
Any dirt on that? Uh, how, uh, that's going?

273
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,620
成果非凡
Outstanding.

274
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,890
这就是我想听的，总统会很欣慰
Great. Oh, great. I was hoping to hear that. The President will be pleased.

275
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,510
虽然我星期一才当上幕僚长
'Cause, I'll tell you right now, I've only been Chief of Staff since Monday, um,

276
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,510
但我对外星人大战很清楚
but I do know that the alien war stuff, these are...

277
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,770
这种会议才有趣
These are the only fun meetings.

278
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,360
我的工作不是要娱乐总统
Look, I'm not here to entertain the President,

279
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,110
但你可以告诉他这场战争...
but you may tell him that the war will be over.

280
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,780
...就快结束了
Soon.

281
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,540
万一他问了我会引用你的话
"...be over..." In case he asks, I just like to have an exact quote.

282
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,960
"战争就快结束了"
"War will be over soon." That is great. Such good news.

283
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,390
真是好消息，我想总统一定会...
And, um, the President would, I know, just love...

284
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,480
...非常想和汽车人领袖握个手...
Really, really love to press the flesh...

285
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,400
或照张像...他叫至尊大人？至尊先生？
Not flesh, obviously, but just maybe get a shot with, um... Is it Lord Prime? Sir Prime?

286
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,160
总统可以坐空军一号来，拍完就走
We could bop on Air Force One. It'd be just a quick bop, then we just bop in and bop back.

287
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,250
是我就不会让他抱太大希望
I wouldn't get his hopes up on that one.

288
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,230
他就叫擎天柱
Okay. He's called Optimus Prime.

289
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,510
非法滞留的外星战斗员
Alien combatant. Here illegally.

290
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,810
但他们不是盟友吗？怎么回事？
But aren't they our friends? Why?

291
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,610
只要他们在地球上我们就不会安全
Because our world will never truly be safe till all of them are gone.

292
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,790
我还以为可以办一个告别仪式
Oh. Well, I would hope we could do a much more ceremonial farewell.

293
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,040
毕竟我们的军队曾和他们并肩作战
Especially since our military has worked so closely with them.

294
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,050
但你不认同  - 地球不是他们的家
- Until you. - It's not their planet.

295
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,800
从来都不是
Never was.

296
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,230
我们该夺回主导权了
Time we take it back.

297
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,960
对，很好
All right, come on. Come on.

298
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,920
太好了
Yes. Yes.

299
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,220
就是这样
Oh, there you go.

300
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,850
不，撑住呀
No, hold it.

301
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,280
别抖了！抖什么抖？我又不会开除你
Stop shaking! Why are you shaking? You have the job!

302
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,700
你忘了吃晚餐！
You forgot to eat dinner!

303
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,870
就是这样我才担心你
You see why I worry?

304
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,630
对不起，亲爱的
Look, sorry, sweetie, I...

305
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,140
差一点就能成功了
I almost got it working right.

306
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,150
我已经做完功课也温习完期末考了
So, listen, I'm done with homework and set with finals,

307
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,440
我想和朋友开车去兜风，可以吗？
so I was just gonna take a little drive with some friends if that was okay with you.

308
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,160
不能有男生，我知道，等毕业再说
No boys, I know. Graduate first.

309
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,660
没错
Exactly.

310
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,710
你知道其他人都没有这种规定
You do know no one else has this rule, right?

311
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,970
规定？别说得这么难听，这叫智慧
Rule? Don't make it sound harsh, okay. It's wisdom.

312
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,430
我不要你大半夜的出去开车
I don't think we need to be driving around in the middle of the night.

313
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,640
现在已经7：45，天都黑了
It's already like quarter to eight. It's almost dark.

314
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,560
史普德，停下来好吗？
Spud, will you stop it?

315
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,400
你知道我毕业典礼那天在哪里吗？
You know where I was for my graduation?

316
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,820
跟我这个意外的错误在一起
Yes. With me, the mistake.

317
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,830
是惊喜，也是我人生中最棒的事
The surprise, Tess. And the best thing that ever happened.

318
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,500
我们看起来不开心吗？
Do we look unhappy? Huh?

319
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,760
那是我人生中最美好的一天
No. It's the greatest day of my life.

320
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,090
你妈过世前我答应过她
I made your mother a promise before she passed.

321
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,520
要让我们的宝贝参加毕业典礼
Our baby's gonna be at her graduation. That's it.

322
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,690
高中男生啥都不懂，慢慢才会成熟
High school boys know nothing. It's only later they turn into men.

323
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,450
所以如果你当时年纪大一点就不会有我
So if you were older and wiser, I wouldn't exist.

324
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,580
我不是这个意思，我们家是不约会的
That's not what I meant.

325
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,630
你不约会我也不约会
You know, this is a non-dating household, okay? You don't date, I don't date. That's it.

326
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,000
或许你该去约会
Well, maybe you should.

327
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,380
泰莎，等一下
Tessa, wait.

328
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
泰莎？
Tessa'?

329
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:27,440
我知道我管的你很紧，但不这样不行
Look. I know I've been on you, okay? But I have to be.

330
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,990
12到17岁是青少年危险期
Twelve to seventeen is the official teenage danger window.

331
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,120
我必须把你保护好
It's my job to get you through it.

332
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,460
你不爽我也没办法
So you can be pissed off all you want.

333
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,640
好啦，你可以和朋友开车去兜风
And, yes, you can take a ride with your friends.

334
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,090
别工作到太晚
Okay. Don't work all night.

335
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,610
记得吃饭
And eat.

336
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,900
老婆，人生中最棒的事...
Best thing that ever happened, Emily.

337
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,820
有她是我人生中最棒的事
She's the best thing that ever happened.

338
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,990
你一定会引以为傲的
You'd be proud.

339
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,250
糟糕
Oh, no.

340
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,020
怎么会这样...
Unbelievable.

341
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,030
真不敢相信，天啊！
Unbelievable. God!

342
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,540
这里一定要有值钱的东西
Something in here needs to make this family some money.

343
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,850
老头子，就你吧
Come on, you old wreck.

344
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,520
是时候看看你了
Judgment Day.

345
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,880
他在哪？  - 不知道
Where is he? I don't know.

346
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,300
"查封通知"

347
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,890
入侵者注意！入侵者注意！
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

348
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,100
废物一个
Asshole.

349
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,940
我正在报警中
I am dialing 911.

350
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,990
泰莎，我可以算是你叔叔
Tess, I'm basically your uncle.

351
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,530
你家就是我家
Su casa es mi casa.

352
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,620
而我们就要失去这个家了
And we're going to lose the casa.

353
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,960
爸爸！
Dad!

354
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,540
来了！
Coming!

355
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,840
你在测试雷射吗？有的话我不进去
Are you working with lasers? If so, I'm not coming in.

356
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,090
我从没见过这种卡车
You guys have never seen a truck like this before.

357
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,760
快进来，把门锁上
Get in here. Lock that door.

358
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,770
这门又没锁
It doesn't have a lock.

359
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,730
你看水箱上的洞，它被打了个大洞！
Look! Look at the hole in the radiator. Look at the size of it.

360
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,030
那又怎样？
Something blew a hole in it!

361
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,870
这不是一般的钢
Yeah, so? It's not normal steel.

362
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,290
引擎里的炮弹碎片把线路都扯断了
The shrapnel in the engine, it ripped all the connections apart.

363
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,630
看好了，这时我的天才就用上了
And watch. And this took some Cade genius.

364
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,800
你们一定会喜欢
You are gonna love this.

365
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,470
我重新将引擎通电之后...
When I hook this back to a working battery...

366
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,440
呼叫所有...
Calling all...

367
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,110
呼叫所有汽车人
Calling all Autobots.

368
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,430
没错，它根本就不是卡车
Oh, yeah. I don't think it's a truck at all.

369
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,490
这应该是变形金刚
I think we just found a Transformer.

370
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,750
快逃！
Evacuate!

371
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,840
别跑！
Wait! Guys!

372
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,590
你疯了吗？这种东西不能留
Dad, are you out of your mind? You need to get that thing out of here.

373
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,010
我整晚都在里面，很安全的
You don't have to worry. I've been in there working all night. I'm fine.

374
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,670
那可不是卡车，
You know what? That's not a truck, okay? You're right.

375
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,720
是外星杀人机器
It's an alien killing machine. Jesus.

376
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,860
他死透了，整组坏了了
Dude. It's DOA. It's been recalled, totaled, done.

377
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,940
我知道要打去哪个单位
So, listen, there's a number that you call.

378
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,330
你应该要通报政府，为了美国好
You're supposed to call the government. It's the American thing to do.

379
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,290
通报后如果证实是外星人
You're supposed to call, and if it ends up being alien,

380
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,080
可以得到两万五千元
then you win $25,000.

381
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,590
才不会有钱  - 如果能像动物频道...
You don't win money. -And if you can capture it live...

382
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,350
帮它装上定位器，可以获得十万块，快打电话  - 听说是这样
Like tag it like a wild wildebeest, then you get $100,000. - Dad, we're making the call. - I heard that.

383
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,600
我看过广告  - 才不是这样
I've seen the commercial. They don't say that. That's not a guarantee.

384
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,190
所以葛瑞格在骗我罗？
You think Greg would lie to me?

385
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,030
如果真的是变形金刚
Look, if that's a Transformer there from the Battle of Chicago,

386
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,780
我要知道他如何运作
I need to know how it works.

387
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,540
我这个发明家搞不好能逆转胜
I'm an inventor. This could be a game changer for me!

388
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,410
如果能把这项科技应用在发明上
If I can apply that technology to my inventions,

389
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,130
我们就再也不愁吃穿了
we'd never have to worry about money again.

390
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,960
这种话我听腻了
I've heard that before.

391
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,390
两万五付我的学费和房贷绰绰有余
Twenty-five grand! It pays for my college.

392
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,560
再说这卡车是花我的钱买来的
It pays for the house.

393
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,780
严格说来属于我的，不是吗？
Besides, you used my money to buy the truck, right? So technically, that's my truck. Don't you think?

394
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,820
你也签过研究室智慧财产权的合约
You also signed a contract regarding all research lab l.P.

395
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,240
啥研究室？明明就是谷仓
Research lab? It's a barn, dude.

396
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,920
你这样算是违反竞业条款
You signed it and now you're competing.

397
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,220
你的任何点子和想法都属于我
Any idea of yours is mine. Any thought you have, I own it,

398
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,850
所以基本上你属于我
so basically, I own you.

399
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,310
我不认为你可以拥有任何人
I don't think you can own someone.

400
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,520
就算是德州也废止很久了
That was, like, a while ago, even in Texas.

401
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,610
把焊枪拿过来，帮我弄一下吊臂
All right. Bring the torch over and help me with the pulley arm.

402
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,950
炮弹碎片毁了他的电力系统
I think the shrapnel took out its power core.

403
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,250
泰莎，你看
Oh, and, Tessa, you see this?

404
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,340
外星杀人机器会让我这么做吗？
Would an alien killing machine let me do that?

405
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,280
我会通报拿奖金，但先让我研究一下
Look, I'll make the call. We'll get the money. Just first let me see if I'm right.

406
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,160
你想躲在家里就去吧
You want to hide in the house? Go ahead. Okay.

407
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,230
开始吧
Let's go. Pulley arm.

408
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,790
真是太夸张了！
I can't believe him!

409
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,370
那是什么东西？看起来好像飞弹
What is that? Looks like a missile.

410
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,290
就是飞弹！
It is! Whoa!

411
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,240
爸！
Dad!

412
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,410
客厅里有颗飞弹！
There's a missile in the family room!

413
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,630
惨了
Holy...

414
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,390
我要杀了你！
I'll kill you!

415
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,610
不！不！
No! No!

416
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,990
有颗飞弹在...
Dad, there's a missile in...

417
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,090
我要杀了你们！退后！
I'll kill you! Stay back!

418
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,170
别开枪！
- Oh, no. Don't shoot. Don't shoot! - Call 911! Run!

419
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,140
叫警察！快逃啊！

420
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,680
别跑！
- Lucas! - Stop!

421
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,280
卢卡斯？别乱动，冷静下来
Lucas? Don't move, just calm down.

422
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,160
给我小心点，人类
Easy, human.

423
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,290
别动，他不会伤害我们
Stay there. He's not going to hurt us.

424
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,670
武器系统损坏
Weapons systems damaged.

425
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,470
一颗飞弹击中你的引擎
A missile hit your engine.

426
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,560
我们把它拿了出来
And we took it out of you.

427
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,560
你伤得很重
You're hurt really bad.

428
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,480
我只是想帮你，这里是我家
I'm just trying to help you. You're in my home now.

429
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,040
我是工程师，叫凯德伊格
I'm an engineer. My name is Cade Yeager.

430
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,790
凯德，我欠你一个恩情
Cade, I am in your debt.

431
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,460
我是擎天柱
My name is Optimus Prime.

432
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,180
我的汽车人伙伴...
My Autobots.

433
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,680
...有危险
They're in danger.

434
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,190
我现在就得离开
I need to go. I need to go now.

435
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,570
你这样是能走多远？
How far you think you're gonna get?

436
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,750
泰莎，过来，他需要帮忙
Tessa, come here. He needs our help.

437
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,000
你发生了什么事？
What happened to you?

438
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,510
人类设下陷阱突袭我
An ambush. A trap. Set by humans.

439
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,190
我逃走并化身成这副模样
I escaped and took this form.

440
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,030
但你是我们的盟友
But you're on our side.

441
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,700
人类为什么要伤害你？
Why would humans hurt you?

442
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,910
他们背后有邪恶势力
They were not alone.

443
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:01,000
我的汽车人伙伴能把我修好
- My Autobots can repair me. - Yeah.

444
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,590
但你无法去找他们
If you can reach 'em.

445
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,530
让我来吧
What about me?

446
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,030
我警告你，地球的艾汀杰先生
I warn you, Mr. Attinger of Earth,

447
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,040
同盟是一种合约，而合约...
an alliance is a contract, and contracts,

448
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,460
...和人类一样...
like humans,

449
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,630
...都会失效
expire.

450
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,300
在地球上我们有个说法
On this planet, we have a saying.

451
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,850
"敌人的敌人就是朋友"
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

452
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,980
我也有一种说法
I also have a saying.

453
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,360
"我才不在乎"
"I don't care."

454
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,620
在墨西哥市发生了什么事？
So what happened in Mexico City?

455
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,790
你怎么没杀他？
I thought you had him.

456
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,330
我击中他三次，造成致命伤害
Three direct hits. A mortal wound.

457
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,670
但你的人让他跑了
Then your men allowed him to escape.

458
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,680
你答应过要提供情报给我
You promised me human intelligence.

459
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,680
还是你们根本没有情报？
Or is there such a thing?

460
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,020
你还是没告诉我
You know, you've still never told me.

461
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,330
你为什么要抓他？你听命于谁？
Why do you want him? Who are you working for?

462
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,620
不管去到哪个星系
Every galaxy I've traveled,

463
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,000
你们这些低等生物都一样
all you species are the same.

464
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,880
觉得万物都围绕着自己运行
You all think you're the center of the universe.

465
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,380
无知到极点
You have no idea.

466
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,940
去五金行把这些东西买齐
Go to the hardware store and you get the list. The whole list.

467
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,360
你要修理他？他又不是电动小火车
What, you're going to try and fix him? He's not a model train set, Cade.

468
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,150
但他很重要
No, that's right. He's important.

469
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,390
谁说的？你不能把外星人藏在这里
Yeah, but important to who? You can't keep an alien locked up in your barn.

470
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,600
你要干嘛，跟他玩躲猫猫？
What are you gonna do, play with him?

471
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,910
你能冷静  - 我也想冷静
- Will you calm down? - I'm trying to,

472
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
但我被他的大炮打中了！
but I just got hit in the head with a ten-foot cannon!

473
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,170
他要是吃了你，你的肌肉车就归我
If he eats you, I get the GTO.

474
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,050
绝对不能跟任何人说，听见没？
Not a word to anybody. Do you hear me?

475
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,550
不能说
Not a single word. Nobody.

476
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,190
"中央情报局"

477
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
我们锁定了一个高价值目标
I think we have a lock on a high-value target.

478
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,240
特战小组已经准备出动
Special Operations group is ready.

479
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,830
有什么消息？
What do you got?

480
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,500
特战小组接到来自德州巴黎市的通报
Sir, Special Ops just got a call from Paris, Texas.

481
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,010
和离开墨西哥市的卡车是同一辆
Hard match on the truck seen leaving Mexico City.

482
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,510
好极了，马上出动
Son of a bitch. Let's go get him.

483
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,650
你吃了一记重击
Took a hell of a hit, you know.

484
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,990
飞弹差点打中你的电源
The missile just missed your power source.

485
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:28,540
这叫火种源，它提供我们生命力 也藏有我们的记忆
We call it a Spark. It contains our life force and our memories.

486
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,550
对我们来说就是灵魂
Yeah, we call it a soul.

487
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,640
叫墓风部队行动
Scramble Cemetery Wind.

488
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,480
大家辛苦了，没你们的事了
Thank you for your efforts, ladies and gentlemen. This room is going dark.

489
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,900
请由左边出口离开
The exit is on your left.

490
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,570
剩下的由我来
I'll take it from here.

491
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,080
出去吧
Okay, let's go.

492
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,080
墓风部队现在出发
I'm with Cemetery Wind. We're on the move.

493
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,250
重复，现在出发
Repeat, on the move.

494
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,770
凯德...
Cade.

495
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,110
你为什么愿意帮我？
Why are you willing to help me?

496
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,910
因为你愿意相信我
I guess maybe because you trust me to.

497
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,450
我回来了！
I'm back!

498
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,240
怎么这么久！
Took you long enough!

499
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,830
我半路去看了医生
My head hurts. I had to go to the doctor.

500
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,920
我头肿了一大块
I got a welt on my head

501
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,750
现在就像"星际争霸战"里的角色
that makes me look like a fricking Star Trek character.

502
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,340
废话真多
Whatever.

503
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,700
你们看！
Look! Look!

504
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,600
进入目标区域
We're on property.

505
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,770
毒蛇15在你们上方
Viper 15 overhead. Angels 1.

506
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,850
爸！
Dad!

507
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,310
伊格先生，我是联邦探员詹姆斯萨伏
Mr. Yeager, my name's James Savoy. I'm a federal agent.

508
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,320
我们在找一辆废弃卡车
My men and I are trying to track down an abandoned truck.

509
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,160
这一大片土地真不错，卖掉很可惜
It's a nice spread you got here. Too bad she's for sale.

510
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,750
谢了，但我没有要卖
Well, thanks. She's not.

511
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,840
你在找的是那辆卡车吗？
That the truck you mean?

512
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,470
不是
Afraid not.

513
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,130
有人通报这里有辆问题卡车
You know, Mr. Yeager, we received a call from someone concerned about this truck.

514
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,360
糟了
Oh, no.

515
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,780
不是你吗？
That wasn't you?

516
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,740
我唯一的问题是...
Only thing I'm concerned about is you being on my property

517
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,620
...你们擅自进入我的土地
without permission.

518
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,120
跟我们德州人作对也要讲规矩
You know, we got a rule about people messing with people from Texas.

519
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,460
我不知道你说的是什么卡车
And I don't know what truck you're talking about.

520
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,880
害死无数美国人的那种
The kind that cost American lives.

521
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,470
给我搜！
Search the property!

522
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,930
不行，你又没有搜索令
What do you mean, "Search the property"?

523
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,180
我的脸就是搜索令
You don't have a warrant. My face is my warrant.

524
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,480
你们如果找到卡车还会给我们赏金吧？
Wait. But if you guys do find a truck, we get a reward, right?

525
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,860
毒蛇15在A点盘旋
Viper 15 holding, point alpha.

526
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,670
C小队，守在原地
Charlie team, hold tight.

527
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,510
进行封锁
Lock it down.

528
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,390
开门进去  - 前有矮墙
- Open, open, open. - Short wall. Short wall.

529
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,020
5号前进中
Five in. Five in.

530
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,940
入侵者注意！请远离私人土地！
Intruder alert! Back away from the premises.

531
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,530
什么鬼东西？  - 白痴发明家
- What the hell is that? - Just some dumb inventor.

532
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,030
没有异状
Clear.

533
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,930
右方没有异状
Clear. Clear right.

534
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,450
没有异状
Clear.

535
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,040
留意周遭
360. 720. Heads on a swivel.

536
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,020
走吧，这里什么也没有
Let's go. There's nothing here.

537
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,200
没发现任何迹象
There's no signs. We got nothing.

538
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,710
长官，垃圾桶里有未爆弹
Sir, we have a live armed missile in the trash.

539
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,290
未爆弹？我还亲手丢的！
Live? I carried that to the trash!

540
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,550
你不是说它是无效弹！
You told me that was a dud, dude.

541
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,510
我差点被他害死
I could be dead. Right?

542
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,440
好，我是找到一辆卡车没错
Look. Okay, yes, I found a truck, all right.

543
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,650
我想拆成零件卖
I towed it back for the parts.

544
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,150
昨晚还在这，今天早上就不见了
I left it here last night. This morning, it's gone.

545
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,690
我发誓我不知道他去了哪里
When? Where? I don't know. I swear to God. That's as much as I know about him.

546
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,030
"他"
"Him."

547
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,170
他说了"他"
He said, "Him."

548
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,380
他知道擎天柱在哪
He knows who the son of a bitch is.

549
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,720
伊格先生  - 干嘛？
- Mr. Yeager. - What?

550
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:11,970
不好意思
Excuse me.

551
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,770
你刚刚说了"他"
You just said, "Him."

552
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,690
把他们抓起来
- Take them down. - What?

553
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,360
放开我！
Ow! Let me go!

554
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,950
他们什么都不知道！要问就问我！
They don't know about the truck! I know! Just let her go.

555
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:27,280
你宁愿背叛亲人也要保护外星人？
What kind of a man betrays his flesh-and-blood brethren for alien metal?

556
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,200
-把他带走 -滚开！
- Get this guy out of my sight. - Get off!

557
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,920
放开她！他们不知道卡车的事
Let her go! They don't know about the truck.

558
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,340
好吧！上车！各处找一找
All right! Load up! Search the perimeter!

559
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,430
卢卡斯，电话是不是你打的？
Lucas, you called, didn't you?

560
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,020
没有！我又不认识这些可怕的家伙
No! I don't know any of these scary guys.

561
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,610
你竟敢对女人动粗！我要给你好看！
Oh, God! You're manhandling a woman! I'll kick your ass!

562
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,730
放开她！
Let her go!

563
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,370
爸！放开我！
- Daddy! Let me go! - You're not going anywhere.

564
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,410
爸！
Daddy!

565
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,870
你不能把我带走！
No! You're not taking me anywhere!

566
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,920
我是美国公民
I'm an American!

567
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:54,590
别轻举妄动  - 好，我错了
- Easy, sweetheart. - Okay, okay, okay. All right. Okay. All right. I was wrong.

568
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,850
萨伏，利用那个女孩
Savoy. Use the girl.

569
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,350
天啊！
Oh, my God! Ahh!

570
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,200
限你十秒内说出卡车在哪里
Now, you got ten seconds. Where's the truck?

571
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,130
你想对我女儿开枪？  - 你逼我的
- You're gonna shoot my little girl? - If I have to.

572
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,470
求求你别开枪！
Please don't shoot me! Please!

573
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,770
我该说的都说了！他走了
Look, I don't know. I told you everything that I know! He's gone.

574
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,600
之前还在里面的，我发誓！
He left. He was in the barn, I swear to God!

575
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,690
快放她走！
- Just let her go! - Ow!

576
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,280
求求你
Please, please.

577
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,450
他本来在里面！放开她！
He was in there! Let her go!

578
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,780
还剩七秒
Seven seconds.

579
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,580
我没骗你！他本来在的！
I'm telling you the truth! He was in there!

580
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,250
爸！
Dad!

581
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,880
叫他放开我女儿！
Tell him to get away from my little girl now!

582
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,690
爸！
Dad!

583
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,140
你敢碰她我就杀了你！
You touch her and I'll kill you!

584
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,150
还剩两秒
You got two seconds.

585
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,950
我要他说实话
I need the truth.

586
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,120
开枪
- Please. - Shoot her.

587
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,610
我在这里！
Here I am!

588
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,660
趴下！
- Get down! - Ahh!

589
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,960
凯德！他们会杀你们灭口！
Cade! They're going to kill you!

590
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,290
快离开这里！
Get out of here!

591
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,200
向右推进！到房子那边！
Push right! Headed to the house!

592
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,430
大家快上车！
Come on. Hurry up! Get in the car!

593
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,810
快上车！
- Let's go! - Daddy, get in the car!

594
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,580
外围部队，擎天柱往你们那边去了！
Perimeter, Optimus moving your way!

595
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,380
怎么回事，宝贝？他们是谁？
What's happening, baby? Who are they?

596
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,340
他们要那辆卡车！
It's the truck. They want the truck!

597
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,180
你又是谁？凭什么叫她宝贝？
"Who are they"? Who are you, and who are you calling "baby"?

598
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,180
回答我的问题
I know you heard me.

599
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,940
我是她男朋友！  - 他是我男朋友！
- I'm her boyfriend! - He's my boyfriend!

600
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,530
你不可能是她男朋友！
What? You're not her boyfriend!

601
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,030
他叫尚恩，他是车手
His name's Shane and he drives, Dad.

602
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,290
那些车是怎样？太吓人了吧！
What kind of cars are those? They're so scary!

603
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,470
又有一辆追上来了！
There's another one coming up the back!

604
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,270
开到玉米田里甩掉他们！
You gotta try to lose them in the cornfield!

605
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,490
他要追上来了！
He's coming up behind us! Go!

606
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,240
毒蛇15即将耗尽燃油
Viper 15, running on fumes. RTB.

607
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,970
我们被困住了！
They've got us cornered!

608
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,270
小心！
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

609
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,040
伊格先生，我不想在这种情况下见面
Mr. Yeager, this is not how I wanted us to meet, okay?

610
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,410
但我叫尚恩，我...
I'm Shane, and I'm a completely...

611
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,750
我不想跟你说话！好好开你的车！
And I am not talking to you! Drive the car!

612
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,460
小心！
Watch out! Watch out!

613
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,610
对他们开枪示警！
Throw 'em some warning shots!

614
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,710
我不知道我可以开这么好
Man, I don't know how I'm driving this good.

615
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,630
又提升到一个新境界了
It's like, today I've gone to a whole other level.

616
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,880
专心开车别说话！
Road, focus! Stop talking!

617
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,430
尚恩，小心！
Shane, look out!

618
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,530
我承认这都是我的错
This may be primarily my fault, okay.

619
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,330
他们说会带支票过来！
They said they were gonna bring a check!

620
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,040
没想到是暗杀部队！
I didn't know they were gonna send a death squad!

621
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,600
坐稳了！
Hang on!

622
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,900
有人宾果了！
Hey, we got ourselves a winner! Don's got it over here.

623
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,570
快闪开！
Look out!

624
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,590
甩掉了！干得好，你这个陌生人
We lost them! Good job, stranger from the cornfields!

625
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,020
那些恐怖的车又来了
The scary cars are back.

626
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,660
开到工厂里甩掉他们！
Lose them at the factory, Shane!

627
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,730
你不是很会开车吗？
I thought you knew how to drive this thing! Go!

628
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:26,410
看来那笔奖金是拿不到了
I don't think we're gonna get that money. Doesn't seem like it.

629
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,930
凯德！
Cade!

630
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:49,080
引他们上楼！
Take 'em upstairs!

631
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,300
到五楼甩掉他们
We're losing them on the fifth floor.

632
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:02,190
用那一招！  - 我知道
- Do that thing, Shane! - You know it.

633
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,150
哪一招？
What do you mean? What thing?

634
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,490
我将要做的会很可怕
What we're about to do is gonna be kind of scary.

635
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,950
把枪拿出来射他们！
Take out your guns and shoot them!

636
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,880
他们开枪了！
They're shooting at us!

637
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,880
泰莎，帮我拉手煞车  - 你想干嘛？
- Tessa, grab my stick! Grab my stick! - What?

638
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,510
她的技术是最好的
She's got the best hands in the business.

639
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,350
准备好了吗？拉！
Ready, Tess? Pull!

640
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,570
不会吧！
- No! No! No! - No f-ing way!

641
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,090
Oh! Yeah!

642
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,880
Yeah!

643
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,230
泰莎，你别想再出家门了！
Tessa, you are so grounded!

644
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,150
轮圈裂开了
Shit! The rim's cracked.

645
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,910
擎天柱...我们快去他那里！
Optimus. Come on, move! Move!

646
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,170
我的脚卡住了！等一下！
My foot's stuck! Wait, Cade!

647
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,170
卢卡斯！  - 等我啊！
- Lucas! - Wait! Wait!

648
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,640
卢卡斯，小心上面！
Lucas! Lucas, above you!

649
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:01,600
快跑！
Run!

650
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,030
快上车！我们走！
Come on, get in, let's go!

651
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,210
你一定很想看看我现在的表情
I'll bet you wish you could see my face right now.

652
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,510
我们就这样把卢卡斯丢下？
Lucas, we just left him?

653
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,850
他已经死了
He's gone.

654
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:49,980
很遗憾你们失去了朋友
My deepest sympathies for the loss of your friend.

655
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:53,650
在我确定没有人跟来之前都待在这
Stay here till I'm sure we weren't followed.

656
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,660
我们现在都是被狙击的目标了
We are all targets now.

657
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:06,300
我们得这样躲躲藏藏？
So we're hiding out now? That's the plan?

658
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,350
我们要听命于一辆卡车？
We're taking orders from a truck?

659
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,520
不然你有更好的办法吗？
Well, you got a better idea?

660
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:15,690
离她远一点，手别那么不安分
Hey, move away from her, kid. Don't...

661
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,200
听见没？
Keep your hands off her. All right? No.

662
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:21,290
你被德州的小发明家搞得灰头土脸
You got your ass kicked by a garage inventor from Texas.

663
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,460
我会记上这一笔
That goes on your resume.

664
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,800
你们全都一样！
Yeah, it goes on all of yours, too!

665
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,720
你以为我想听你在这里发飙吗？
Do I look like I'm in the mood for any of your shit today?

666
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,310
华府以为我们在追杀霸天虎
Washington thinks we were chasing a Decepticon target,

667
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,890
不把这一家人揪出来
but our story falls apart

668
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,400
我们就站不住脚了
if we don't find this Yeager family first.

669
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:38,030
他如果通报警察或FBI怎么办？
Yeah, well, what if he goes to the cops or the FBI?

670
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,320
他们会把他交给我们
They know to hand him over.

671
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,330
他回不去原本的生活了
His world as he knows it is gone.

672
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:51,430
往好处想，至少你们认识了
Well, bright side, you guys met.

673
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,350
他是哪里人？
Where is he from?

674
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,660
我说过他是德州的车手  - 德州？
I told you, he's a driver from Texas. Texas?

675
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,240
我不知道爱尔兰是在德州
Where, Dublin, Texas? Shamrock, Texas?

676
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,570
他的腔调很像小矮妖
So why does he sound like a leprechaun'?

677
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,160
你在爱尔兰说这种话会被揍
You'd get your ass kicked in Ireland for saying that.

678
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,420
但这里是德州，小绿人
Well, we're not in Ireland, Lucky Charms. We're in Texas.

679
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,090
你说他是车手？职业的？
And so he drives? What do you mean, he drives?

680
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:13,310
对，至少他能养活自己
Like, for a living? Yeah. At least he makes a living.

681
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,930
谢谢你
Thank you.

682
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,110
我是拉力赛车手，我是车手...
Look, I race rally cars.

683
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,640
...她是我的领航员
One driver. One navigator. Her.

684
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:22,500
我是被认可的
By the way, I'm totally legit.

685
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,700
红牛已经决定要赞助我
I just got picked up by Red Bull.

686
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,790
顺便告诉你
And just so you know,

687
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:29,840
我所有的财产就是那辆车
my life savings was in that car back there.

688
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,680
我不准你们交往  - 已经是事实了
- This is not happening. - Oh, it definitely is.

689
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,690
你几岁？
How old are you?

690
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,360
20
Twenty.

691
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:45,540
她才17岁
She's a 17-year-old girl.

692
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,370
两种方式让你选
So we can work this two ways.

693
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,550
一是我揍你，你叫警察来抓我
One, I punch you right in the mouth and you call the police on me.

694
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,800
二是...
- Dad. - Or two,

695
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,680
...我叫警察来抓你
I just call the cops on you

696
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,470
因为你诱拐未成年少女
because this is illegal. She's a minor.

697
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,470
我们受罗密欧与茱丽叶条款的保护
We're protected by the Romeo and Juliet laws.

698
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,600
我们交往一阵子了
We dated for a little while.

699
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,820
当时我高一，他高三，所以没问题
I was a sophomore, and he was a senior. It's fine.

700
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:01,980
问题可大了
No, it's not fine.

701
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,990
我们未成年就已经在一起
We've got a preexisting juvenile foundational relationship.

702
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,450
第22.011号条例
- Statute 22.011. - What?

703
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,960
"罗密欧与茱丽叶"条款
Texas statute?

704
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,130
德州条例？还真的有？
- That a real law? - Yep.

705
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:14,840
"罗密欧与茱丽叶"是吧？
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

706
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,140
你们知道他们的下场吧  - 他们相爱
- You know how those two ended up? - In love.

707
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:21,900
他们死了，你父母知道这件事吗？
Dead. Do your parents know about this?

708
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:24,650
你爸让你跟17岁的女生交往吗？
Is your dad okay with you dating a 17-year-old girl?

709
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,450
我五岁时他就离家了
He took off when I was five,

710
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,040
如果我遇到他我会问问看
but if I ever bump into him, I'll ask him.

711
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,460
泰莎
You know, Tessa,

712
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,960
我一直很信任你  - 有吗？
- I trusted you. - To what?

713
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:35,090
你要我跟你一样不享乐，不冒险
Never have fun, take a risk,

714
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,050
当个平凡的青少年？
be a normal teenager, like you?

715
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,770
我是你父亲，我尽心尽力的在照顾你
I am your father, okay? And I have been busting my ass to take care of you.

716
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:43,400
所以你就把那辆卡车开回家？
Is that what you were doing when you brought home the truck?

717
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:47,320
明明通报就会没事，现在卢卡斯死了
All you had to do was report it, and now Lucas is dead.

718
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,990
我的人生也完了，多谢你
And my life is over. Thank you.

719
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,170
你把我照顾得真好
You've taken real good care of me.

720
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,400
求求你别开枪
Please don't shoot me!

721
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:06,900
求求你！爸！
Please! Dad!

722
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,990
他们真的想杀了她
They were willing to kill her.

723
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,410
现在也还是
Then they still are.

724
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:18,280
幕后一定有人指使，我要把他找出来
Somebody somewhere gave that order. I'm going to find some fingerprints.

725
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,140
求求你们！
Please!

726
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,650
不！
No!

727
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,910
我是汽车人！我是汽车人！
I'm an Autobot! I'm an Autobot!

728
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,080
去找些用得上的物品
Grab whatever you think we can use for supplies.

729
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,460
衣服什么都好，把那部电脑带着
Clothes, anything. And take that computer.

730
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,170
我们走
Let's go.

731
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,890
"石中洞屋"

732
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,860
真不好控制
This is not easy.

733
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,150
你总有拿手的事，爸爸
You know, you don't suck at everything, Dad.

734
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,690
搞什么...   - "帐户已被锁定"
What the...

735
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:07,900
我就知道
I knew it.

736
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,120
你说他是无名小卒
You told me he was no one.

737
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,660
那为什么...
Well,

738
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:19,170
...他会控制我们的发明
this "no one" has our tech.

739
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,090
"我会把你揪出来！"

740
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,600
呼叫所有汽车人
Calling all Autobots.

741
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,270
呼叫所有汽车人
Calling all Autobots.

742
00:51:58,830 --> 00:51:59,670
我的妈呀！
- Whoa! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God!

743
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:26,360
太神了！超夸张的！但真的有够牛
That was insane! It was awesome, but it was insane, right?

744
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,450
好耶！太棒了！
Oh, yeah! Hell, yeah!

745
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,830
他回来了！他还活着！
He's back! He's alive!

746
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,840
擎天柱回来了！
Optimus is here!

747
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:59,160
我们终于又有了希望
At last. There is hope after all.

748
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,940
太棒了
Yeah.

749
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,370
自由银河的领导者回来了
Mr. Leader of the Free Galaxy is back.

750
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,880
我就知道你会来，我从不怀疑
I knew you'd make it. I never doubted.

751
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,470
我们收到了你的警讯
We got your warning.

752
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,880
一直都在等你的消息
We've been waiting.

753
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:35,600
没错，酷毙了，汽车人再度集结
Hell, yeah. Boom time. We got the gang back together.

754
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:57,770
人类要求我们遵守他们的游戏规则
Humans have asked us to play by their rules.

755
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:01,860
但现在规则变了
Well, the rules have just changed.

756
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,580
人类只会在背后捅你一刀
Human beings, bunch of backstabbin' weasels.

757
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,870
探长，你要明辨是非
Hound, find your inner compass.

758
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:10,130
忠诚就像一朵在恐惧...
Loyalty is but a flower in the winds

759
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:12,090
...和诱惑的暴风中凋零的花
... of fear and temptation.

760
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,760
你在胡扯些什么？  - 我在吟俳句
What the hell are you saying? - It's a haiku.

761
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:15,720
别闹了
Cut the crap,

762
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,310
否则我就把手榴弹塞进你的喉咙
before I drop a grenade down your throat.

763
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,900
想死就来  - 我不怕了，来啊
Try it, you'll be dead. Oh, please pull it. Please do it.

764
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:23,400
这样可以省下不少时间
You know what, it'll save us so much time.

765
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,020
对于地球上的一切...
Well, raise your hand

766
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,810
...感到无福消受的请举手
if you're thoroughly disenchanted with our little pleasant Earth vacation.

767
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,710
这几个搭便车的人是谁？
So, who's the stowaways?

768
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,170
干嘛把枪对着我？
Oh, whoa, hey, what's with the gun?

769
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,100
住手，他们冒了生命危险救我
Stop. Hound, both of you. They've risked their lives for mine.

770
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,310
要知恩图报
We owe them.

771
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,190
其他同伴都没消息吗？
So, there's been no sign of any others?

772
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,610
只剩我们几个了
- Nada. - We are all that's left.

773
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,830
人类把我们一个个都干掉了
They're picking us off, one by one.

774
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,960
我们本是可悲又落魄的四金刚
We're the pathetic, dirty foursome.

775
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,840
加上你就五个了
And you make five.

776
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,430
我们以后都要像这样...
So that's our best-case scenario?

777
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,890
...活在汽车人的保护下吗？
Autobot witness protection?

778
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,600
你想走没有人会拦你，极速赛车手
Hey, Speed Racer, you're welcome to leave anytime.

779
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,190
我先说清楚，超级老爸
Well, for the record, Superdad,

780
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,780
要躲也是跟擎天柱，而不是跟你
I'm not hiding with you. I'm hiding out with that big guy.

781
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,290
师父，由于你生死未卜
Sensei, with your fate unknown,

782
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,460
大黄蜂就暂代指挥
Bumblebee has held command,

783
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:19,640
但他完全没有一个战士该有的样子 他幼稚到不行
despite his complete and total lack of anything resembling warrior discipline. He's like a child.

784
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,060
让你看看我的厉害  - 你只会丢脸
This child is about to kick your ass. He brings us shame.

785
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,280
开打了
Cage fight.

786
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,490
自以为聪明
Smart ass.

787
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,990
他们在干嘛？
What's the matter with them?

788
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,410
你们看不出他那无辜大眼下的矫情吗？
Am I the lone sage who sees through this puppy-dog eyes act?

789
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:36,950
不应该这样的
It's beneath you.

790
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:39,290
我一直在等他们自相残杀
Yes, I've been waiting for them all to dispatch each other,

791
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:43,270
这样我就可以高枕无忧，自己当老大
so I could take charge with no trouble at all. Just me reporting to me.

792
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:44,940
看来他们没有你不行
Well, it sure looks like you've been missed.

793
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:48,650
各位，地狱猎人正在追杀我们
Autobots, Lock down is hunting us

794
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:51,160
而人类正在助纣为虐
and humans are helping.

795
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:53,540
我们必须搞清楚原因
We need to know why.

796
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:56,670
我不知道原因，但我大概知道是谁
Well, listen, I don't know why, but I have an idea about who.

797
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:02,810
这个空拍机有汽车人被突袭的画面
This drone I stole recorded footage of an Autobot raid.

798
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,940
画面很片段，但看仔细了
It's in pieces, but watch what happens here.

799
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,030
那是铅腿
Oh, that's Lead foot.

800
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,700
他死得好惨
They rip him apart.

801
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:13,290
一群野蛮人
Savages.

802
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,210
后来这辆卡车把他载走
And later, this truck comes to haul him off.

803
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,920
KSI动态科技公司
KSI. Kinetic Solutions.

804
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,260
政府国防和航太计划的承包商
Defense, aerospace, government contracts.

805
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,340
这空拍机是他们发明的
They designed this drone.

806
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:23,050
所以政府追杀你们
So these government guys just hunt you down,

807
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,770
再把你们交给KSI？
and then pass you off to this KSI?

808
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,360
KSI的总部在芝加哥
The company is headquartered in Chicago.

809
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,070
汽车人可能都被抓到那里
That could be where they were taken.

810
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,280
要进去势必得大战一场
No way to get inside without a battle.

811
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,830
如果有人类帮忙呢？
Well, what if you had some human help?

812
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,330
你们现在是要搭挡吗？
- What, are you two partners now?

813
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:36,410
亲爱的，我们现在也成了目标
Sweetie, we're targets now, too.

814
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:38,880
要回到原本的生活就得查出原因
We need to know why or we'll never get our lives back.

815
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,090
各位...
Autobots,

816
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:43,050
...我曾发誓不杀人类
I have sworn to never kill humans.

817
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,390
天大的错误
Big mistake.

818
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,680
但一旦让我查出谁是幕后元凶
But when I find out who's behind this,

819
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:51,120
他必死无疑
he's going to die. Hooah!

820
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,390
芝加哥

821
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:08,710
我们正被追捕，得按新规矩来
There's a full-on manhunt out for us, so we have some new rules.

822
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:10,900
戴识别证的都不是盟友
Anyone who has got a badge is not our friend.

823
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,820
我们要各个击破
We're gonna divide and conquer.

824
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:14,570
你们两个去偷食物和必需品
You two in charge of stealing food and the essentials.

825
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,120
其他都别拿
And nothing else.

826
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:25,090
KSI芝加哥总部就像一座堡垒
Chicago KSI headquarters is like a fortress.

827
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,720
我会想办法混入最高军事机密区
I'm gonna find a way into their top-secret military wing.

828
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,060
我会找到把柄威胁他们...
Find something to blackmail this company and the government.

829
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,980
...和政府，再夺回我们的自由
We're gonna get our freedom back.

830
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,834
早上好 乔伊斯先生
Good morning, Mr. Joyce.

831
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:49,966
那是什么声音?
What was that sound?

832
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,260
就是那个声音
That's "the" sound.

833
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,928
你要求的那个
That you asked for.

834
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,516
我要求的是无界空灵的声音
No, I asked for boundless. Transcendent.

835
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,016
当人们跨进这栋建筑物的大门时
When you walk through a door in this building,

836
00:58:01,054 --> 00:58:03,604
就像跨进了未来一样
it should sound like you've stepped into the future.

837
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:09,861
现在
Present.

838
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,283
说
Say it.

839
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:16,618
未来
Future.

840
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:20,788
过去是历史 现在已成了过去
The past is history. The present is past.

841
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,832
未来才是现在
The future is now.

842
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,959
我为什么联系不上你?
Why can't I get in touch with you?

843
00:58:26,502 --> 00:58:28,963
你不明白北极的发现意味着什么吗?
Don't you realize what the Arctic find means?

844
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,634
记得我们小时候听的那些故事吗?
You know that story we were all told as children

845
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,011
几百万年前 巨大的小行星撞击了地球
about a giant asteroid that struck the Earth

846
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,544
造成了恐龙的灭绝?
millions of years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs?

847
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,766
- 记不太清了  - 故事错了
- Vaguely.  - We were wrong.

848
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,769
是金属造成了大灭绝
This metal caused the great extinction.

849
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,552
原因和原理 我还没弄清楚
How and why, I can't yet say.

850
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:48,024
但是根据碳测定 这些可以追溯到公元前6千5百万年
But carbon dating puts it at 65 million years B.C.

851
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:52,091
你让我们去挖这种矿石 比你想得更危险
This ore you've got us digging for is a lot more dangerous than you think.

852
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:52,946
我的人...
And my people...

853
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:57,116
达茜 我想你在外面工作太久了?
Darcy, I think that you've been out in the field for far too long.

854
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,161
我们吃午饭的时候再谈恐龙怎么样?
Why don't we discuss dinosaurs over dinner?

855
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,705
- 吃小牛排?  - 没门
- Ribs?  - Not a chance.

856
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,251
你不知道这里都出了什么大事
You have no idea what's been happening here.

857
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,212
技术将要发生飞跃
We're about to make the quantum leap.

858
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,173
一种地球上罕见的金属
A rare-earth metal.

859
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,884
有不稳定的分子结构
Molecularly unstable.

860
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,887
没有工业用途
Industrial uses, none.

861
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,764
然后外星人来了
And then the aliens came.

862
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,449
我们找到了其中的联系
And we made the connection.

863
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,228
他们就由这种材料做成的
It's what they're made of.

864
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,137
这就是圣杯
It's the Holy Grail.

865
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:30,191
我们叫它"变形素"
"Transformium." That's what we're calling it.

866
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,693
引人入胜  让人着迷
Focus-grouped. Catchy.

867
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:32,944
- 已经打上了我们的商标  - 是啊
- Trademarked. - Yeah.

868
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,489
这是继原子分裂之后 现代物理学
This is the greatest advance in modern physics

869
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:38,172
最大的飞越
since the splitting of the atom.

870
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,535
这是种可以设计的物质
It's programmable matter.

871
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,518
现在 我们绘出了它的基因图
And now, we've mapped its genome.

872
00:59:42,556 --> 00:59:44,706
- 是我  - 现在 你已经绘出了它的基因图
- I.  - Now you've mapped its genome.

873
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:49,043
就能对它发出
And now we can begin to give it

874
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,795
命令
instructions.

875
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,261
这玩意儿棒极了
This is extremely good.

876
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,722
看着
Watch this.

877
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:12,066
我们在任意的物质间变换
We can change anything into anything.

878
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,822
简直是性感 你觉得呢?
Sensual, almost. Don't you think?

879
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,746
你喜欢音乐吗?
Do you like music?

880
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:26,873
变成小音箱
The Pill.

881
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,711
来点暴力的东西?
Perhaps something a little more violent?

882
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,593
天啊 你成功了
My God. You've done it.

883
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:41,512
在航空领域 军事领域...
In aerospace, the military...

884
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,515
整个机器人工业都是我们的
We will own the entire robotics industry.

885
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,184
所有探索都有可能
All exploration.

886
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:49,145
下入海洋 上入宇宙 无所不达
The oceans. Space. Everything.

887
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:52,815
温布利 这是什么东西?
Wembley. What is this?

888
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,816
你要的水母广告啊
The jellyfish commercial that you wanted.

889
01:00:55,854 --> 01:00:58,404
你说它们性感而又致命 跟女人一样
You said they were erotic yet deadly, like women.

890
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,864
我没说过
I never said that.

891
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,699
- 你说过  - 我没有
- Yes, you did.  - No, I didn't.

892
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:02,784
我肯定听你说过的
I definitely heard you say it

893
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,035
因为当时你在说前女友的事
'cause you were talking about your ex-girlfriend,

894
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:05,828
性感 但很专横
who was sexy, but a bitch.

895
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,929
巡视的时候 请别吃东西
Please don't eat on the tour.

896
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,957
就是她吗?
Is that her?

897
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,881
嘿 我找来了一大包衣服裤子
Hey, I found a whole bunch of boxes of clothes.

898
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:20,264
宝贝 你可以穿条漂亮的宽松长裤了
So, sweetie, you can get some long pants, nice, loose-fitting ones,

899
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,902
这短裤就扔了吧 好吗? 你们带回来了什么?
and lose the short shorts, okay? What'd you guys get?

900
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:25,973
蛋白质
It's protein.

901
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:28,007
我说过 就拿生活必需品 好吗?
Look, I said the essentials, okay?

902
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:30,436
本来这种事就不简单好吗 我们差一点就被抓了
It wasn't easy. We almost got caught.

903
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:31,896
你还偷了漱口水?
You stole mouthwash?

904
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,829
跟你女儿亲热的时候 我喜欢闻起来好闻点
I like to be fresh when I'm making out with your daughter.

905
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,943
好好笑啊
That's funny.

906
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,255
永远也别想
Yeah, that's not happening ever.

907
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:44,909
永远?
Ever?

908
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:48,162
这就是我们军用模型机"惊破天"
This is our military prototype, Galvatron.

909
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,873
这我就看不懂了
I don't understand it.

910
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,418
这样已经第五次
This is the fifth iteration.

911
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,451
为什么这东西还是这个样子?
Why does he keep turning out like this?

912
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,837
估计就是最后转化出了问题吧
It's just some bugs in the final render.

913
01:01:58,714 --> 01:02:01,884
我是根据擎天柱的样子设计惊破天的
I modeled Galvatron after Optimus Prime.

914
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,303
为什么他看起来还是像威震天?
Why does he keep looking like Megatron?

915
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:07,412
转化序列将近完成 请准备
Rendering sequence is almost finished. Stand by.

916
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:09,076
就是简单的编程
Simple coding.

917
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,812
算法而已!
Algorithms!

918
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,064
数学而已!
Math!

919
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:18,484
为什么我们不能按照我们想要的设计
Why can't we make what we want to make,

920
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,486
用我们想要的办法去造东西呢?
the way we want to make it?

921
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,156
为什么?
Why?

922
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:28,911
而且 这样子看上去像是契合消费者心理的产品吗?
And does that look like a consumer-friendly face to you?

923
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,999
胸前那个大洞又是搞什么啊?
And what about that big hole in the chest?

924
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,334
我觉得挺诺 我蛮喜欢的
I think it's bad-ass. I like it.

925
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,920
- 赞一个  - 但我讨厌这造型
- Love it.  - Well, I hate it.

926
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,549
哦 他来了
Oh, here he is.

927
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,093
光头弗兰肯斯坦博士
That bald-headed Doc Frankenstein.

928
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:47,972
这完全是不合法的 是完全不合法的试验
Ma'am, this is not legal. This is illegal experimentation.

929
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,114
就算外星人也不会这样对待人类!
Aliens would never do this to people!

930
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,141
可能会吃了你们 杀了你们 但也仅限如此
Eat you, kill you, maybe, but that's it.

931
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:54,544
但这样完全不对! 没有人会把小孩子关进盒子里
This ain't right! Nobody puts baby in a box!

932
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,053
这比水刑还要糟糕!
This is worse than waterboarding!

933
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,068
这个小家伙一直协助我们
This little gentleman has been translating for us

934
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,744
转译这两个大脑中的信息
all the information that comes from these two heads.

935
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,532
包括他们的历史 科学 所有的一切
Their history, their science, everything.

936
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,035
- 这是威震天吗?  - 没错
- Is that Megatron?  - Precisely.

937
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:10,912
你怎么弄到这些的?
Where did you get all this?

938
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,622
政府特级委托合同
Special government contract.

939
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,964
现在我们了解变形金刚的一切了
Now we know everything about Transformers.

940
01:03:15,002 --> 01:03:17,418
长远来说 我们就能自己造了
And now at long last we can build them ourselves.

941
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,378
而且还能造出更好的
And we can build them better.

942
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,277
好的 干得漂亮 大黄蜂 这样就能进去了
Yeah, that's good, Bee. That'll get us in.

943
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,992
每天有几次 KSI的员工
A couple times a day, these guys are moving

944
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:53,126
会拉车进公司 进行所谓的"扫描"
in vehicle shipments into KSI for something called "scanning."

945
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,787
安保措施严密
Major security all over.

946
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:58,292
所以我们最可靠的办法就是从后面的秘密研究室入口进去
So our best shot at getting in is a back classified research entrance.

947
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,576
明早我开着大黄蜂过去
I'm gonna drive in with Bee tomorrow morning.

948
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,342
不好意思
Excuse me.

949
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,475
在我面前不准身体接触 好吗?
There's no smooching in front of me, okay?

950
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,261
你真死板 再说谁还用"身体接触"这种词?
You're so square. Who even says "smooching"?

951
01:04:11,299 --> 01:04:12,890
我说了吧 简直不孝
I tell you, no respect.

952
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,642
有些时候 真不可理喻
It's just impossible sometimes.

953
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:17,645
是啊 大黄蜂之前也这样子
Yeah. I went through that with Bumblebee.

954
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:27,530
冷静 冷静点
Calm down. Calm down.

955
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:30,016
要知道 这种情况下
You know, at a time like this,

956
01:04:30,054 --> 01:04:33,754
要冷静 别在乎外表 所以你能把墨镜摘掉吗?
the idea is to keep cool, not look cool, so why don't you lose the glasses?

957
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:35,830
大概一个月前
About a month ago,

958
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,556
有天晚上我觉得家里有点响动
middle of the night, I thought I heard noises in my house.

959
01:04:39,594 --> 01:04:40,459
那是你吗?
Was that you?

960
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,643
什么? 拜托 不是我
What? Come on. No way.

961
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:42,719
别骗我 小鬼
Don't lie to me, kid.

962
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,813
你看到那边那个配枪的家伙吗?
You see that guy with the gun out there?

963
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:45,923
这里太多人拿着枪了
There's so many guys with guns.

964
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,008
我这就下车告诉他
Let's get out of the car and tell him

965
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,342
我们要闯进去的计划 诬陷你是主谋
we're about to break in and it's your idea,

966
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,511
反正我没关系 我老了 我已经活够了
'cause I don't care. I'm old, I've already lived long enough.

967
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,801
老家伙 你真的很喜欢
You have a really bad habit

968
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,389
在错误的时间点提起要命的话题诶
of having these conversations at the wrong time, man.

969
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:56,239
那你准备坦白从宽 还是逼我下车去?
You want to come clean or you want me to make a mess?

970
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,542
先生 麻烦你能过来一下吗?
Sir, can I talk to you for a second, please?

971
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,680
是我 是我 那次就是我
It was me, it was me, it was me, it was me.

972
01:05:00,718 --> 01:05:02,887
对不起 对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

973
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,541
去扫描的吗?
Taking it in for scanning?

974
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:10,489
好的 你们可以走了
All right. You're good to go.

975
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,273
你真的死定了
I'm literally gonna kill you.

976
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:15,202
三号港扫描中
Scanning in bay three.

977
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:18,386
我们利用外星人古老的科技
We took old, alien technology

978
01:05:18,424 --> 01:05:20,499
来帮我们塑造更好的今天
and made it better in every way.

979
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,376
隆重推出"讽刺者"
Introducing Stinger.

980
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,672
KSI公司 我们创造世界
KSI. We make the world.

981
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,177
看起来很虐
That is a bad-ass robot.

982
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:34,088
看起来跟你蛮像的 大黄蜂
He kind of looks like you, Bee.

983
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,515
历史是过去 现在就是未来
Here is the past. And now the future.

984
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:37,892
他们想造自己的变形金刚
They're trying to build their own versions.

985
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:40,825
至少他们造的车比这辆车藕芏喟
Well, at least they're picking cooler cars than this.

986
01:05:43,351 --> 01:05:44,791
你胆敢这么跟我说话?
You talk to me like that?

987
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:45,816
大黄蜂 住手!
Bee, stop!

988
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,235
你现在知道 自作聪明的人有什么下场了吧?
You see what happens from being a wiseass?

989
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,603
给我滚出去
Now get out of here.

990
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,948
讽刺者 灵感来源于大黄蜂
Stinger, inspired by Bumblebee,

991
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,316
但青出于蓝
but better in every way.

992
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:57,244
什么! 你个混...
What! Son of a...

993
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:59,028
别 别! 你要冷静
No, no! You gotta calm down.

994
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:01,040
- 他疯了!  - 住手!
- He's crazy!  - Stop!

995
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:03,918
大黄蜂! 大黄蜂 别疯了!
Bumblebee! Bee, stop going psycho!

996
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,005
所以我们现在没有足够的变形素做生产 你知道吗...

997
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,530
你们晚了 是你晚了 是你

998
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:13,344
我的小野花 你生气的时候 我真不懂你说什么
My delicate flower, I can't understand you when you're angry.

999
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,936
事实上 我完全不懂你在说什么
Actually, I don't really understand you at all.

1000
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:17,851
我们整个工厂都准备好生产...
Our entire factory is up and running...

1001
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,433
不好意思 嘿!
Excuse me one second. Hey!

1002
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,686
叫你俩呢! 懒惰胚
Hey, you two! Grease monkeys.

1003
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,154
这边什么情况?
What the hell is going on here?

1004
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,689
这辆老古董是什么意思?
What's with this vintage crap?

1005
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:28,651
我们才不扫描这种老古董
We're not scanning collector car junk.

1006
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,445
你觉得我们这边是干什么的?
What do you think it is that we make here?

1007
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:34,073
我们写诗好吗 我们是诗人
We make poetry. We're poets.

1008
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:38,119
懂吗? 你替我工作的 你记过一次 一次 懂了吗?
All right? You work for me, you get one mistake. One. Understood?

1009
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:39,662
- 下次不会有了  - 肯定没下次了
- It won't happen again.  - It certainly won't.

1010
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,331
赶快把这辆烂车开出这里
So let's get this pathetic thing out of here.

1011
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:43,916
你也可以滚蛋了
And you, too.

1012
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,626
对不起 真是抱歉
So sorry. So sorry.

1013
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:47,837
我们去下个地方吧
Let's move on.

1014
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,171
看好他 我去看看有什么线索
Watch him. I'm going to see what I can find.

1015
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,705
安静地离开这里
Quietly get out of here.

1016
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:54,123
我保证 我保证 你别生气 不然我受不了
I swear. I swear. I can't bear it when you're angry.

1017
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:55,704
哇哦
Whoa.

1018
01:07:02,387 --> 01:07:03,787
大黄蜂 你需要冷静点
Bee, you gotta calm down right now.

1019
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:04,812
我很冷静 伙计
I'm perfectly calm, dude.

1020
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:07,314
那需要深呼吸 或者你们类似的方法都行
You gotta breathe, or just do whatever it is that you do.

1021
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,191
我很冷静 很冷静 我都没碰它
I'm calm. I'm calm. I'm not even touching it.

1022
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,985
好吧 我就碰了一小下 就一小下
Okay, I'm barely touching it. I'm barely touching it.

1023
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,570
天啊 快点变回车形!
My God. Turn back into a car right now!

1024
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,696
别来烦我 好吗?
Get out of my face, all right?

1025
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:14,864
我们的设计团队
Our design team

1026
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,615
从大黄蜂的造型入手
started with the Bumblebee.

1027
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,326
但实话说 这造型设计确实挺过时了
But really, this alien's design was decrepit

1028
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,810
说实话 算古董级别了吧
and, let's face it, antique.

1029
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,246
我了个...
What the...

1030
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:24,206
- 别太在意 大黄蜂  - 样子有点老旧 有点猥琐
- Don't take it personally, Bee.  - Kind of old and ratty.

1031
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,750
你是想说很丑吧
You mean ugly.

1032
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,669
- 见鬼去吧!  - 不! 不准!
- Hell, no!  - No! No!

1033
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,713
你自以为比我更好吗?
You think you're better than me!

1034
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:33,507
咦哈!
Yee-hah!

1035
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,972
你又乱动什么了?
What did you touch?

1036
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:46,187
# 跟你说了 小伙子 不要乱碰 #
# I told you, homeboy. Can't touch this #

1037
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:48,522
十五分钟后去我办公室
My office in 15 minutes.

1038
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:51,045
这里是第七解剖室
This is dissection room seven.

1039
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:53,778
惊破天 第12次解剖手术
Galvatron, render postmortem number 12.

1040
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:57,656
延续32项继续头部肢解
Continued head disfigurement at event number 32.

1041
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,997
谈判怎么样了? 好了吗?
So what about the deal? Is it done?

1042
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,130
你拿到"种子"了吗?
Did you get the Seed?

1043
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,583
等禁闭抓住擎天柱就能到手了
We get it when the bounty hunter gets Prime.

1044
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,170
与此同时 还有个小问题
Meanwhile, there has been a complication.

1045
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,505
什么?
A what?

1046
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,174
错了 错了
No, no.

1047
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:17,107
在KSI 我们不用这个词
At KSI, we don't use words like that.

1048
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:21,639
一名窝藏汽车人的平民黑入了你的一个小型侦察机
A civilian harboring the Autobots has hacked into one of your mini-drones.

1049
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:24,558
说明他们可能知道你参与此事了
Meaning, they may know of your involvement.

1050
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,268
什么?
What?

1051
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,110
刚刚情况的确有点紧张啊
That was a little bit intense.

1052
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:39,490
我需要更多的变形素来制造原型机 刻不容缓
I need more Transformium, and I need it now, to build more prototypes.

1053
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:42,201
你告诉你那个外星赏金猎人
You tell your alien bounty hunter

1054
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:46,247
我把整个公司都赌在上面了
that I have staked my company on this deal.

1055
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,290
而我也就把命赌上了
And I have merely staked my life.

1056
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,751
嘿 是你过来找我商量的 记得吗?
Hey, you came to me on this, remember?

1057
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:52,837
你从中情局退休
You retire from the CIA,

1058
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,798
我公司七位数工资聘请你 你和我
you get a seven-figure piece of my company, and you and I

1059
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:59,051
一起革新国家防御体系
revolutionize national defense together.

1060
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:03,472
但是 艾丁格 为了我们俩好
But, Attinger, buddy, for both our sakes,

1061
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:06,767
你需要尽快
you need to deliver

1062
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:09,395
把"种子"给我
the Seed.

1063
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,122
我进来了 能看到画面吗?
I'm in. Can you see my camera?

1064
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,083
他们在融化救护车
They're melting Ratchet.

1065
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,128
他们在肢解救护车!
They slaughtered Ratchet!

1066
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:37,381
我要把他们五马分尸!
I'm gonna tear them apart!

1067
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,091
金属
Metal.

1068
01:09:40,175 --> 01:09:42,575
只是金属而已 我就是这么看待他们的
Just metal. That's what I always thought of them.

1069
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,430
其实不是这样子的
Well, they're not.

1070
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:46,663
他们也是生物 跟我们一样有灵魂的生物
They're living things, with souls like ours.

1071
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,477
之前 我跟一个还交谈过
Once, I spoke to one.

1072
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,022
你是研究变形素的?
And you're working with Transformium?

1073
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:56,108
哦 没错 我就是做这个的
Yeah, that's what I do. I am.

1074
01:09:56,191 --> 01:09:59,391
我负责外部的发掘工作 但是能利用的确实不太多
I'm out there digging for it. There's just not much left to find.

1075
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:02,364
所以你们现在已经黔驴技穷了吗?
So that's how badly you boys need more?

1076
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,648
无计可施到只能融化这死掉的霸天虎了
Reduced to melting evil old Decepticons down.

1077
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:08,495
不对 这是个汽车人
No. That's an Autobot there.

1078
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:10,831
就是和我们一起并肩作战过的
The ones who fought for us.

1079
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:13,500
- 这边我已经处理好了  - 好的
- I've got this taken care of from here.  - Right.

1080
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:15,834
两边分别同时进行证件扫描
Same badge code scanned at two separate gates.

1081
01:10:15,872 --> 01:10:18,333
马上封锁所有机密区域
I'm having the classified area locked down now.

1082
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:26,847
检查那家伙
Check that guy.

1083
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:30,434
嘿!
Hey!

1084
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:32,394
给我站住!
Stop right there!

1085
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,733
站住!
Stop!

1086
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:44,782
站住!
Freeze!

1087
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:48,953
靠墙站好
Up against the wall.

1088
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,136
好吧
All right.

1089
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:55,501
商业间谍 这可是重罪啊 伊格尔先生
Corporate espionage. That's a very serious crime, Mr. Yeager.

1090
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:15,729
喔
Wow.

1091
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,776
我要请律师
Look, I want a lawyer.

1092
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:23,059
要司法部的 要我能相信的人
The Justice Department. Somebody I can trust.

1093
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:24,321
我只是想保护自己的家人 懂吗?
I'm just trying to protect my family, okay?

1094
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,505
不要和你们公司或政府有关的律师
Not from your company, from the government.

1095
01:11:26,543 --> 01:11:27,710
伊格尔先生
Mr. Yeager,

1096
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,535
你觉得我是替谁工作的?
who do you think I work for?

1097
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,830
你要保护你的家人 这精神很高尚
You're trying to protect your family, that's admirable.

1098
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:36,000
而我在保护我们国家免受外星人的战乱
I'm trying to defend the nation from alien war.

1099
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,133
我们已经承受了一次打击了
We've had a taste of what that looks like,

1100
01:11:38,171 --> 01:11:40,381
我们不准备再经历一次 现在...
and we are not gonna tolerate another. Now...

1101
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:44,675
接下去的结果一种是 你回你的谷仓
There is a version of this conversation where you get to go back to your barn,

1102
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:47,109
你女儿顺利优等成绩毕业
your daughter gets to graduate with honors,

1103
01:11:47,147 --> 01:11:49,608
你之前的生活可以继续下去
and life as you know it will go on.

1104
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:53,559
因为你完全不明白你在趟哪趟浑水
You have no idea what you're involved with here.

1105
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:56,353
是吗?
Really?

1106
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,688
那另一种结果呢?
What's the other version of this conversation?

1107
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:02,973
是派上次杀我女儿的人呢?
The one when you send in the hired help to murder my little girl?

1108
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,487
还是你准备自己动手解决问题?
Or you gonna man up and do it yourself?

1109
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:09,783
你想要哪种?
What's your preference?

1110
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:12,619
这问题我只问一遍
I'm going to ask you this once.

1111
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:14,872
擎天柱在哪里?
Where is Optimus Prime?

1112
01:12:49,327 --> 01:12:51,377
快点 我们离开这里
Come on. Let's get out of here.

1113
01:12:51,415 --> 01:12:53,584
转移中 地下室见
We're moving. Basement.

1114
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,164
他们闯进来了
They're here.

1115
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,002
出去! 全都出去!
Get out! All of you!

1116
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:03,420
科学展结束了 混球们!
Science fair's over, meatbags!

1117
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:04,755
- 把这实验室毁了!  - 走开 走开!
- Destroy the lab!  - Move, move, move, move!

1118
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,257

1122
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,459
把我从这鬼地方放出去!
Break me out of this Frankenstein box!

1123
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:20,729
嘿!

01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:26,068
住手!
Stop!

1127
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:27,736
这可是公司财产!
That's company property!

1128
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,197
他们可不是你的财产!
They're not your property!

1129
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:35,661
他们是我的朋友
They were my friends.

1130
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:41,416
你现在不说话啦! 探长面前不敢多嘴啦?
You ain't talking so much now! You got Hound in front of you?

1131
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,751
动手啊
Go ahead.

1132
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,310
让我瞧瞧你们的厉害 来啊
Show us your true colors, once and for all.

1133

下命令把 我直接碎了他
Just give me the word, I'll splatter him.

1134
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:52,970
为什么你不告诉那手指痒痒的家伙 这些只是战争的牺牲品而已
Why don't you tell Itchy Fingers here that this is all the spoils of war.

1135
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:54,054
金属而已
Dead metal.

1136
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:59,017
创新 也是我们科学的源泉
Innovation. What we do here is science.

1137
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:02,187
就算我们不用 别人也会用的
Because if we don't do it, somebody else will.

1138
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,565
因为科技的前进不是你能阻止的!
Because you cannot stop technology!

1139
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:07,860
我们不是开发科技的耗材!
We're not your technology!

1140
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,867
让我粉碎这家伙
Let me vaporize his ass.

1141
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:19,371
我已经解开了基因码 我已经拥有你们的染色链
I broke the code. I own your whole genome.

1142
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:22,916
世界会了解你的所作所为的
The world will know what you're doing here.

1143
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:26,295
世界? 世界只会认可我的做法
The world? The world will approve.

1144
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,922
如今我们能制造你们了
We can make you now.

1145
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:33,260
还没有醒悟吗? 我们不需要你们了
Don't you get it? We don't need you anymore.

1146
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,597
这话太伤人了
That was cruel.

1147

01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:48,817
结束了? 我们不准备大开杀戒什么吗?
We're done? We're not gonna kick a little bit of ass?

1150
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,944
我早就准备对某人下手了
I've been itching to kill something lately.

1151
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,696
这就是我们的机会 我们必须阻止他离开
This is our chance. We have to stop him.

1152
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:53,906
你必须阻止他

1153
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,429
这东西从来没实地测试过
It's never been tested in the field.

实验室 军事基地都可以 但日常街道上从来没试过

你这是正当防卫 动手啊!

擎天柱 我为你感到遗憾 你为人类效忠
I feel sorry for you, Prime. Your allegiance to these humans.

1217
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:38,929
忠于事业的麻烦之处 就是事业总会背叛你
The trouble with loyalty to a cause is that the cause will always betray you.

1218
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:42,355
谁派你来的?
Who sent you here?

1219
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,858
你认为自己从哪来的?
Where do you think you came from?

1220
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:46,693
你以为你是天生的吗?
You think you were born?

1221
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,614
不 你是被造出来的
No. You were built.

1222
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:53,658
你的创造者想让你回家
And your creators want you back.

1223
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:56,870
我们都效忠于某人
We all work for someone.

1224
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:08,715

- 泰莎 我抓不住了!  - 爸!
- Tessa, I can't hold on!  - Dad!

1240
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:52,258
泰莎!
Tessa!

1241
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,784
- 救我!  - 打破它! 打破玻璃!
- Help me!  - Just break it! Break the glass!

1242
01:22:54,844 --> 01:22:55,845
泰莎...
Tess...

1243
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,976
凯德 警告汽车人!

1246
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:38,805
把那个人类丢到垃圾堆

1247
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:51,651
秘书先生
Mr. Secretary.

1248
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:56,114
我的人在路上 这是中央情报局行动
My team is on the way. This is a CIA operation.

1249
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,742
这是我的资源
This is my asset.

1250
01:23:59,075 --> 01:24:01,661
叫军队解除戒备

1251

1252

探员 你好!
Agent, hello!

1253
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:05,582
天啊
My goodness.

1254
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:08,001
白宫这大家都忐忑不安
Boy, is it a flurry of excitement over here at the White House.

1255
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:10,420
大家都对我非常非常生气
Everybody is super, super mad. At me.

1256
01:24:10,503 --> 01:24:12,803
所以 我翻了下上次会议的笔记
So, I went over my notes from our last meeting,

1257
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:15,258
我不确定你有提到 在密歇根大道上方
and I'm not sure when you said anything about

1258
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:17,541
会出现一艘巨型外星战舰
a "giant alien warship over Michigan Avenue."

1259
01:24:17,579 --> 01:24:19,748
告诉总统 这不是攻击

1260
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,272
还记得这艘船吗 擎天柱?
Remember this ship, Prime?

1261
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:32,108
为你们这些骑士 伟大的圣骑士专门打造
Built for all you Knights, you great crusaders,

1262
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:34,360
来探索宇宙的
to explore the universe.

1263
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:38,364
现在被我强占了 成了我的私人监狱
Well, I commandeered it. It's my personal prison now.

1264
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:35,672
擎天柱?
Optimus?

1265
01:25:43,137 --> 01:25:46,641
欢迎回到骑士圣殿 擎天柱
Welcome back to the Knights' Temenos, Prime.

1266
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:51,062
你玷污了它
You have disgraced it.

1267
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:59,821
和你的叛徒朋友们待一块吧 逃兵
Join your fellow rebels, fugitive scum.

1268
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,908
这里关的是最稀有的标本 最森严的监狱
It's for the rarest of specimens. The worst of the worst.

1269
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,410
已经建造了好几世纪
It's taken centuries,

1270
01:26:06,035 --> 01:26:09,873
我都收集了所有骑士 就差你了

1271
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:21,009
创造者们想要清理棋盘
The creators want to sweep their chessboard clean.

1272
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:27,348
我不是他人的奴隶
I'm slave to no one.

1273
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:32,520
物种混杂
All this species mixing with species.

1274
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:35,398
破坏了宇宙平衡
It upsets the cosmic balance.

1275
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,775
创造者们不喜欢
The creators, they don't like it.

1276
01:26:38,192 --> 01:26:42,196
他们建造你 是让你遵从命令
They built you to do what you were told.

1277
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:46,282
怎么还不起飞?
Why hasn't it taken off yet?

1278
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,360
加油啊 大黄蜂 它在降落 你要登上去!
Come on, Bee, it's descending. You got to get on it!

1279
01:26:48,465 --> 01:26:50,765
萨伏伊 任务完成
Savoy, mission accomplished.

1280
01:26:50,803 --> 01:26:53,166
禁闭抓到大黄蜂了 交易即将进行

1281

去侦查点拿"种子"
Picking up the Seed at the recon point.

1282
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:11,824
耐斯特 泰隆 飞船看上去没问题
Nest, Talon. L.Z. appears clear.

1283
01:27:33,247 --> 01:27:35,197
虽然我很享受捕猎的乐趣
Much as I've enjoyed the hunt,

1284
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:37,961
但我不会想念你们这可怜的星球
I won't miss your wretched planet.

1285
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:41,255
我们的交易完成了 擎天柱换"种子"
Our deal is done. One Prime for one Seed.

1286
01:27:43,716 --> 01:27:45,718
小心拿好
Handle it with care.

1287
01:27:48,554 --> 01:27:51,516
我相信你们人类已经准备好了
I trust your species is ready.

1288
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:53,685
不用你操心我们人类
Don't worry about our species.

1289
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,646
永别了 地球
Farewell, Earth.

1290
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:08,241
快点 快点!
Come on, come on!

1291
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,421
大黄蜂 快点!
Bee, come on!

1292
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:26,926
这是个坏主意 但我也最喜欢坏主意了
It's a bad idea. But I'm all about bad ideas.

1293
01:28:27,677 --> 01:28:29,012
走吧!
Let's go!

1294
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:32,306
好吧 大干一场
Well, let's rock.

1295
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,161
这太疯狂了
This is crazy.

1296
01:28:53,244 --> 01:28:54,746
听着 你想反悔 现在赶紧跑
Look, you wanna cut and run, you better do it now.

1297
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:56,164
我会拼命一试
I'm gonna die trying.

1298
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:59,056
嘿 我不是来帮你救女儿的
Hey, I'm not here to help you get your daughter.

1299
01:28:59,094 --> 01:29:01,144
是你来帮我救女朋友的
You're here to help me get my girlfriend.

1300
01:29:02,795 --> 01:29:06,632
启动黑暗物质引擎 全速前进
Engage dark-matter drives. Full power.

1301
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:18,609
我们在敌人后方
We're behind enemy lines now.

1302
01:29:18,647 --> 01:29:21,731
禁闭的船有陷阱 眼睛放亮点
Lockdown's ship has booby traps. Eyes open.

1303
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:24,714
小心他的碎骨机 砍头机 剥皮机
Beware of his bone grinders, brain blinders, flesh peelers,

1304
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:25,876
染色体逆流机
chromosomal inverters,

1305
01:29:25,914 --> 01:29:29,363
污泥 黑洞陷门 当然还有辐射
catatonic sludge, black hole trapdoors, and, of course, radiation.

1306
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:32,408
我们动作要快 要出其不意
We must be quick. We have the element of surprise.

1307
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:35,203
万不得已时再使用暴力
Let's try to use violence as a last resort.

1308
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:37,997
搞定它!
Get it!

1309
01:29:38,122 --> 01:29:39,248
我杀死你! 杀了你!
I kill you! Kill you!

1310
01:29:39,496 --> 01:29:40,976
我讨厌那些东西
I hate those things.

1311
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,377
- 太变态了  - 他已经死了
- That's freaky.  - He's not alive anymore.

1312
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:45,880
好了 我们看过了 他们没在这 我们走
Well, we looked. They're not here. Let's go.

1313
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:48,480

What? Hey, I'm not going anywhere without Tessa.

1314
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:50,927
我搞不懂 这对我有什么好处?
I'm unclear. What's in it for me?

1315
01:29:51,385 --> 01:29:52,970
对你有什么好处?
What's in it for you?

1316
01:29:54,013 --> 01:29:56,349
冷静点 我们好好谈
Easy. Let's use words.

1317
01:29:56,682 --> 01:29:59,602
对你的好处就是我不会杀了你
What's in it for you is I don't kill you.

1318
01:29:59,685 --> 01:30:03,147
我们要把老大救回来 还有那个女孩 明白没?
We're getting the boss back. And the girl. Copy?

1319
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:08,111
好 好啦 很有说服力 典型的男子汉气概
Okay, okay. Very persuasive. Textbook machismo.

1320
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:11,030
好吧 我们要搞点破坏
Well, then. We'll need to sabotage something.

1321
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:14,951
最好快点 黑暗物质引擎快要准备好起飞了
Better hurry. Because dark-matter drives are preparing to take off.

1322
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:17,453
- 很好  - 我们只有十分钟时间
- Wonderful.  - I give us 10 minutes.

1323
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:19,622
那是什么声音? 引擎启动?
Is that what that sound is? The engines filling up?

1324
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:21,385
你是说这玩意就要...
Are you telling me that thing's gonna be...

1325
01:30:21,415 --> 01:30:23,084
十分钟内就要飞离这里?
This is gonna be flying out of here in 10 minutes?

1326
01:30:23,194 --> 01:30:24,394
十分钟?
Ten minutes?

1327
01:30:24,418 --> 01:30:25,739
可能是九分钟 最坏的情况是七分钟
Could be nine. Worst case, seven.

1328
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:28,005
- 人类 你们去找牢房  - 我们在浪费时间 走吧
- Humans, search the cell blocks.  - We're wasting time, let's go.

1329
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,539
- 我们去找中心核  - 走把
- We'll find the center core.  - Let's move.

1330
01:30:30,633 --> 01:30:32,483
我们要阻止这艘噩梦船
We're gonna stop this nightmare ship.

1331
01:30:47,753 --> 01:30:50,253
在这么大的船上我们根本找不到她
We're never gonna find her in this huge ship.

1332
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:52,210
就像大海捞针
Like a needle in a haystack.

1333
01:30:52,655 --> 01:30:53,990
泰莎!
Tessa!

1334
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,534
棒极了 太好了
Great. Great.

1335
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:00,705
那可够顺利的
That was smooth.

1336
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:03,838
不 真的很顺利 让所有人都知道我们在这
No, that was really smooth, letting everybody know we're here.

1337
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:05,676
现在他们就会找我们了
Now they're gonna be looking for us.

1338
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:17,430
十字线 最好快点 趁我们还没进入太空之前!
Better hurry, Crosshairs, before we go into space!

1339
01:31:17,763 --> 01:31:20,099
这里有个小枣
Here's the little jujube right here.

1340
01:31:21,767 --> 01:31:23,477
你好啊 妈妈
Hello, Mama.

1341
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,783
是谁发射了锚?
Who fired the anchors?

1342
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:44,957
谁在我的船上? 有个囚犯脱逃了
Who's on my ship? We have a loose prisoner.

1343
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:46,250
去吧他们给我找出来

1344
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:51,380

Well, don't say that to me. Now I want to turn around.

1454
01:39:10,944 --> 01:39:12,344
没什么大不了的 亲爱的
It's nothing major, sweetie.

1455
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:14,371
那表示问题很严重!

我必须把枪指向你的方向
I'm gonna have to point this gun in your direction.

1457
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:18,541

It's gonna feel like it's in your direction, but I'm not.

01:41:39,384 --> 01:41:42,846
我讨厌这破烂 你驾驶 我射击
I'm sick of this crap. You fly. I shoot.

1478
01:41:43,889 --> 01:41:46,039
嘿 你最好让我知道怎么使用这个大家伙
Hey, you better let me fire this big-ass gun

1479
01:41:46,099 --> 01:41:48,599
- 让船开快点!  - 哇 哦 哦!
- and make this ship go faster!  - Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1480
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:52,105
听好! 速成教学 追踪弹
Listen up! Crash course. Tracer guns.

1481
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:55,150
往前推是开火 往后滑是重装弹药
Punch forward to fire, slide back to reload.

1482
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:56,235
什么?
What?

1483
01:41:56,401 --> 01:41:58,278
推 稳 滑 重复 推 稳 滑 重复
Punch, hold, slide, repeat. Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1484
01:41:58,362 --> 01:41:59,962
等等 你在说什么?
Wait. What're you talking about?

1485
01:42:00,045 --> 01:42:01,254
- 我不知道他是什么意思  - 祝好运
- I don't know what he means.  - Good luck.

1486
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:02,783
你要去哪?
Where are you going?

1487
01:42:03,075 --> 01:42:04,326
释放仇恨
To lay some hate.

1488
01:42:14,419 --> 01:42:15,419
- 说!  - 好
- Say it!  - Okay.

1489
01:42:15,462 --> 01:42:16,547
推 稳 滑 重复
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1490
01:42:16,755 --> 01:42:18,105
推 稳 滑 重复
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1491
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:32,203
耶 我击中一架! 喔!
Yeah, I got one! Whoo!

1492
01:42:34,064 --> 01:42:35,364
这些外星枪太强悍了!
These alien guns kick ass!

1493
01:42:38,652 --> 01:42:40,070
快点 他快追上了!
Come on, he's on us!

1494
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,697
大黄蜂 你要快点! 低头!
Bee, you gotta move! Duck!

1495
01:42:45,033 --> 01:42:46,702
大黄蜂 开火!
Bee, fire the gun!

1496
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:01,131
哇 喔 喔 喔!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1497
01:43:10,934 --> 01:43:12,144
哇 哦 哦!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1498
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:17,024
太疯狂了!
That was insane!

1499
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:19,907
泰莎 你还好吗?
Tess, you okay?

1500
01:43:27,826 --> 01:43:29,703
好吧 先生?
Okay. Sir?

1501
01:43:32,497 --> 01:43:34,207
你最好有保险!
You better have insurance!

1502
01:43:36,501 --> 01:43:37,836
保险?
Insurance?

1503
01:43:38,503 --> 01:43:39,803
这他妈是艘宇宙飞船
It's a freaking spaceship.

1504
01:43:40,213 --> 01:43:42,413
你去帮一艘宇宙飞船投保试试
You go get insurance on a freaking spaceship.

1505
01:43:42,451 --> 01:43:43,801
祝你好运 兄弟
Good luck with that, buddy.

1506
01:43:44,176 --> 01:43:46,261
这是你的车?
Is this your car?

1507
01:43:49,598 --> 01:43:51,516
亲爱的 把外星枪给我
Sweetie, hand me my alien gun.

1508
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:54,000
给你
Here you go.

1509
01:43:54,144 --> 01:43:55,145
过来
Come here.

1510
01:43:55,854 --> 01:43:57,731
- 相信你爸  - 好
- Trust your dad.  - Okay.

1511
01:44:04,571 --> 01:44:07,699
准备好太空发射
Prepare for interstellar launch.

1512
01:44:15,707 --> 01:44:17,834
我们准备好分离了 就快离开这里了
We're almost ready to separate. We're almost there.

1513
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:20,079
- 快点 他要发射了!  - 好的 老大
- Hurry, he's launching!  - All over it, chief.

1514
01:44:20,087 --> 01:44:23,215
禁闭发现我不在时他已经在太空深处了
Lockdown will be in deep space before he realizes I'm gone.

1515
01:44:23,298 --> 01:44:25,717
我是很烂的飞行员 但还是试试吧
I'm a sucky pilot, but let's give it a whirl.

1516
01:44:25,801 --> 01:44:27,219
走吧 耶!
Hell, yeah!

1517
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:37,854
你们中情局的人处事还真是巧妙
You CIA guys are really subtle.

1518
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:40,730
干得漂亮 真是神不知鬼不觉
What a deft hand. I'm sure nobody noticed all that.

1519
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:43,747
听着 警察肯定马上就要到了
Look. In a few minutes, there are gonna be Feds all over this place,

1520
01:44:43,944 --> 01:44:46,144
我可不希望他们发现圣杯
and I don't want them finding our Holy Grail.

1521
01:44:46,196 --> 01:44:49,696
所以带上所有设备 尽快转移到中国基地
So we're gonna take all our R&D, we're moving it to our China facility.

1522
01:44:49,734 --> 01:44:50,325
对
Yeah.

1523
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:54,079
我想要"种子" 但我想让你把它带到那里
I want you to bring me the Seed, but I want you to bring it to me there.

1524
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:59,418
约书亚先生 我认为您的产品实验存在诸多问题
Mr. Joshua, I would not describe your product testing as perfected.

1525
01:44:59,668 --> 01:45:02,068
我们可以在中国慢慢改进
We have plenty of time for improvements in China.

1526
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:05,882
先生 惊破天 他...
Sir, Galvatron. He was...

1527
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:07,175
是个失败的产品
A fiasco.

1528
01:45:07,592 --> 01:45:10,220
是个杂种 让我颜面尽失
A farrago. An embarrassment.

1529
01:45:10,929 --> 01:45:13,223
他为什么会说话?
And he spoke. How did that happen?

1530
01:45:13,306 --> 01:45:15,456
你知道什么叫"失误"吗 温布利?
Do you know what a flaw is, Wembley? A flaw?

1531
01:45:15,494 --> 01:45:18,603
"失误"就是"彻底失败"
A flaw is a total failure.

1532
01:45:18,937 --> 01:45:23,942
我的机器人居然不受我的控制 我很想知道是为什么!
I did not have control over my prototype, and I want to know why!

1533
01:45:42,044 --> 01:45:46,256
有个好消息要告诉大黄蜂 我们找到离开用的飞船了
Let's give Bumblebee the good news. We got a ship now. We're leaving.

1534
01:45:47,049 --> 01:45:50,719
人类 尽管我们做了这么多
You humans. After all we have done.

1535
01:45:51,053 --> 01:45:53,555
你们还是浑然不知自己做错了什么
You don't know what you've wrought upon yourselves.

1536
01:45:53,789 --> 01:45:55,950
什么情况? 你在说什么?
What? What is it now? What are you talking about?

1537
01:45:55,974 --> 01:45:58,224
我有点搞不清楚状况!
I mean, I'm doing stuff out of my league here!

1538
01:45:58,262 --> 01:46:01,229
你们看不明白是谁在控制谁
You don't see who's controlling who.

1539
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:04,107
我发现的那个人造机型
Within that manmade prototype I fought,

1540
01:46:04,566 --> 01:46:07,069
让我觉察到
I sensed the presence

1541
01:46:07,402 --> 01:46:08,737
威震天的存在
of Megatron.

1542
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:12,032
是挑起芝加哥战役的霸天虎吗?
What, the Decepticon that started the Chicago War?

1543
01:46:12,365 --> 01:46:15,415
你以为KSI公司要怎么制造那些机器人?
How do you think KSI built those bots in the first place?

1544
01:46:15,453 --> 01:46:16,787
他们有霸天虎的头颅
They had a whole mess of

1545
01:46:16,953 --> 01:46:20,040
打算要采集他的思想
dead Decepticon heads and they were downloading their minds!

1546
01:46:20,332 --> 01:46:22,250
我负责解剖工作
And I was in charge of autopsy duty.

1547
01:46:22,375 --> 01:46:25,087
没有同伴 也不给我好处
No union, no benefits, no nothing.

1548
01:46:25,545 --> 01:46:27,045
他们让我只身一人面对威震天
They hooked me up to Megatron,

1549
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:29,372
但他的思想不像他们想的那样毫无生机
and that mind wasn't as dead as they thought.

1550
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:31,426
他给他们想要的数据信息
He fed them the science and specs!

1551
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:34,304
那样他们就可以给他打造一个新的身躯
All so they could build him a brand-new body.

1552
01:46:35,555 --> 01:46:38,975
他为那些机器人注入邪恶的基因
Then he infected it with his evil, nasty chromosomes.

1553
01:46:40,685 --> 01:46:44,189
他们有血红闪亮的眼睛 我能感受到
They had red, beady eyes. They got all in my lovely locks.

1554
01:46:44,272 --> 01:46:45,722
他们在他的关爱下长大
I can smell it right now.

1555
01:46:46,024 --> 01:46:48,026
而他运筹帷幄!
Total inside custom job!

1556
01:46:49,778 --> 01:46:53,448
KSI公司可能将他命名为"惊破天"
KSI might have named the body the snappy name of Galvatron,

1557
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:56,368
但其实他是威震天的转世!
but that's just Megatron reincarnated!

1558
01:46:56,701 --> 01:46:58,601
你知道这么多 却没提醒他们?
You knew this and you didn't warn them?

1559
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:02,791
小姑娘 面对死亡谁都会变得冷酷
Little girl, you can go to a pretty dark place when you on death row.

1560
01:47:02,874 --> 01:47:05,377
他一直在欺骗KSI公司
He's been playing KSI all this time,

1561
01:47:06,002 --> 01:47:09,214
这样他才能操控他们去找"种子"
all so that he could manipulate them into going after the Seed.

1562
01:47:11,216 --> 01:47:12,342
等等 种子?
Wait. The Seed?

1563
01:47:12,425 --> 01:47:14,886
那些一直追着我们的雇佣兵
Those nasty soldiers that were chasing us.

1564
01:47:15,053 --> 01:47:16,096
我看到他们上了船
I saw them board the ship,

1565
01:47:16,179 --> 01:47:18,629
带走了那个被称作"种子"的东西
and they took something that they called the Seed.

1566
01:47:18,723 --> 01:47:21,773
听我说 大约六百万年前...
Listen. Sixty million years ago, give or take an eon...

1567
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:25,147
成千上万的星球都被"种子"机械化了
thousands of planets were cyber-formed with Seeds.

1568
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:33,446
它把你们的有机体变成了组成我们的各种元素
They turned your organic life into our elemental metals.

1569
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:39,327
创造者毁灭了你们的世界而造就了我们的世界
Our creators destroyed your world to make us.

1570
01:47:39,953 --> 01:47:42,664
惊破天想让这一切再次发生
And that's what Galvatron wants to happen again.

1571
01:47:42,998 --> 01:47:47,002
他想在最繁华的都市引爆种子 让生灵涂炭!
He wants to detonate that Seed in the biggest city and kill millions!

1572
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:49,963
他想让世界知道 "我回来了"
He's gonna show the world, "Baby, I'm back."

1573
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:54,801
冲击波会把城市夷为平地
The blast wave will incinerate that city into molten metal.

1574
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:58,096
这让他能够建立起一直军队
He'll have enough to build a massive army

1575
01:47:58,346 --> 01:48:01,975
把你们人类永远消灭
and annihilate your species forever.

1576
01:48:02,267 --> 01:48:05,317
你们愚蠢的人类 正在自取灭亡
You dumb, greedy bastards just brought extinction to yourself.

1577
01:48:05,355 --> 01:48:07,856
不过反正不关我的事  我已经自由了
Not my problem, though. I'm free at last.

1578
01:48:07,939 --> 01:48:10,289
我没什么要担心的 我可以走了
Whole thing worked out good for me. I'm walking.

1579
01:48:10,327 --> 01:48:12,705
我们得在惊破天之前拿到种子
We got to get the Seed before Galvatron does.

1580
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:17,100
中国 北京

1581
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:30,600
种子是我们公司的救星
The Seed is going to be the salvation of our company.

1582
01:48:31,129 --> 01:48:33,006
我们今晚去提货
We take delivery tonight.

1583
01:48:33,298 --> 01:48:36,198
下个月在蒙古的荒漠 我们将它引爆
And next month, we detonate safely in the Mongolian desert.

1584
01:48:36,676 --> 01:48:40,639
就能有够用百年的变形素
And we'll create enough Transformium for a hundred years.

1585
01:48:45,101 --> 01:48:48,063
爸 我不想再偷偷摸摸 躲躲藏藏了
Dad, I'm tired of running and stealing.

1586
01:48:48,146 --> 01:48:49,856
有地方睡觉了
Well, a place to sleep.

1587
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,983
嗯 又是非法闯入
Yeah. Just another break-in.

1588
01:48:57,656 --> 01:48:59,456
我像你们这么大的时候
You know, when I was your age,

1589
01:49:00,033 --> 01:49:02,994
也曾经很疯狂 喜欢汽车 喜欢姑娘
I liked to get a little wild. I liked cars, girls.

1590
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:08,875
但后来有了泰莎
But then there was Tessa.

1591
01:49:09,314 --> 01:49:11,864
她出生了 从此我一心希望
And when she was born, all I ever wanted out of life

1592
01:49:11,902 --> 01:49:14,102
她能够健康快乐
was for her to be happy and healthy and safe.

1593
01:49:14,631 --> 01:49:17,467
我以为自己能够保护好她
Somehow I thought I'd always be enough to protect her.

1594
01:49:19,427 --> 01:49:20,929
但我没有
But I won't be.

1595
01:49:21,346 --> 01:49:22,847
我没做到
I'll never be.

1596
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:26,351
我希望有人能做到
So somebody better be.

1597
01:49:31,314 --> 01:49:33,364
谢谢你今天能来 幸运小帅哥
Thanks for being here today, Lucky Charms.

1598
01:49:36,444 --> 01:49:39,244
谢谢你没开枪打我
Well, thanks for not shooting me when you had the chance.

1599
01:49:39,322 --> 01:49:40,448
不能那么便宜你
I'll have more.

1600
01:49:42,492 --> 01:49:44,160
好吧 我能看出来
Yeah, I can see that.

1601
01:49:45,078 --> 01:49:48,206
我们破解了加密通讯
We've intercepted the encrypted communications.

1602
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:52,877
约书亚・乔伊斯正在去中国广州的工厂
Joshua Joyce is headed to his factory in Guangzhou, China.

1603
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:55,046
嘿 大老板
Hey, big shot.

1604
01:49:56,339 --> 01:49:58,300
你的公司有麻烦了
Your company's in serious trouble.

1605
01:49:58,466 --> 01:50:00,216
你最好找个好律师
You better have a damn good lawyer.

1606
01:50:00,218 --> 01:50:01,219
是吗?
Really?

1607
01:50:01,553 --> 01:50:02,512
你才应该找个好律师
Well, you better have a great one 'cause

1608
01:50:02,595 --> 01:50:05,140
因为你马上就要成为炸掉城市的罪犯了
you're about to be responsible for the annihilation of a city.

1609
01:50:05,223 --> 01:50:06,433
现在 你听我说
Now, you listen to me.

1610
01:50:06,516 --> 01:50:08,768
你的网络被侵入了 模型被篡改了
Your tech has been hacked. Your prototypes are infected.

1611
01:50:08,977 --> 01:50:11,146
惊破天想要种子
And now Galvatron is after that Seed.

1612
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:14,896
我知道你良心未泯 因为你和我一样 是个发明家
Look. I know you have a conscience because you're an inventor, like me.

1613
01:50:14,934 --> 01:50:17,652
千万不要让惊破天靠近种子
Do not let Galvatron anywhere near that Seed.

1614
01:50:17,736 --> 01:50:20,196
惊破天是我制造的 我能控制他
I control Galvatron. I created him.

1615
01:50:20,905 --> 01:50:22,365
你心知肚明
Deep down, I know you know.

1616
01:50:23,491 --> 01:50:25,869
是你的机器人在控制你
Your prototype's been controlling you.

1617
01:50:29,539 --> 01:50:32,289
这玩意把我们运到地球另一边要多久?
How fast can that thing get us halfway around the world?

1618
01:50:32,327 --> 01:50:35,205
很快 它可是宇宙飞船
Very. It's a spaceship.

1619
01:50:51,978 --> 01:50:55,065
要走的话 现在就快走
If we're traveling, now's the time.

1620
01:50:56,608 --> 01:51:00,108
不管付出什么代价 我只想回到以前
All I want is to have our life back. It's your call. Whatever you want.

1621
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:07,992
自己走还是靠他们 哪个更安全?
Are we safer on our own, or are we safer with them?

1622
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:18,588
她是一个守护者
She's a keeper.

1623
01:51:19,297 --> 01:51:20,507
肯定是继承她妈妈
Must take after her mom.

1624
01:51:22,175 --> 01:51:24,302
这话说得不假
I can't argue with that, kid.

1625
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:28,556
快走! 我们去找种子
Move! We're retrieving the Seed,

1626
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:31,726
就不用再管人类的破事了
but then we're done defending the humans.

1627
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:34,270
不管? 你不管是什么意思?
What, done? What do you mean, you're done?

1628
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:37,524
就是"完了" "回见" "拜拜"
Means "finished," "see ya," "good-bye."

1629
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:55,792
抢了我的船? 你怎么能让他们得逞?
Hijacked part of my ship? How did you let this happen?

1630
01:51:55,875 --> 01:51:59,087
关闭黑暗物质引擎 以光速返航
Shut down dark-matter drive, reverse course at light speed,

1631
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:00,588
赶紧回去!
and get us back!

1632
01:52:00,922 --> 01:52:03,675
擎天柱敢抢我的战利品
Prime's taken my trophy case.

1633
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:06,636
我让他吃不了兜着走!
And he will feel my wrath!

1634
01:52:10,227 --> 01:52:12,862
KSI公司中国工厂

1635
01:52:14,227 --> 01:52:15,562
欢迎来到中国
Welcome to China.

1636
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:18,731
隔离惊破天 告诉工程师不要激活他
Put Galvatron in containment. Tell the techs do not activate him.

1637
01:52:18,815 --> 01:52:19,858
没问题 先生
Absolutely, sir.

1638
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:22,026
给我最高戒备

1639
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:26,448
乔伊斯
Joyce.

1640
01:52:26,739 --> 01:52:30,869
能把这个交给你 我真是高兴
I cannot tell you how enthused I am to deliver this.

1641
01:52:33,413 --> 01:52:35,748
这是你最大的愿望吧
Top of your alien wish list.

1642
01:52:36,124 --> 01:52:39,127
归你了 或者说是归我们了
It's yours. Or rather ours.

1643
01:52:41,588 --> 01:52:43,506
我想看看我的报酬
I will need to see my advance.

1644
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:46,509
五百万公司股票
Five million shares of the company.

1645
01:52:46,593 --> 01:52:48,543
我们携手 永远阻止战争
Together, we're gonna end human warfare.

1646
01:52:48,970 --> 01:52:51,473
我们将为美国建立起一支全自动化部队
We're about to build a fully automated U.S. Army.

1647
01:52:51,556 --> 01:52:54,392
设想一下我们会拯救多少美国人
Just think of all the American lives we're gonna save.

1648
01:53:03,985 --> 01:53:08,865
所有这些车都是最新的KSI民用机器人样板

1649
01:53:09,282 --> 01:53:11,882
我们什么时候能开始后续生产?
So how soon until we can start continuous production?

1650
01:53:23,087 --> 01:53:27,425
我想我们休息一段时间如何?
You know, why don't we take a beat on this for a minute?

1651
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:30,887
最近我发现了一些数据...
I have some new data that I discovered and...

1652
01:53:31,095 --> 01:53:32,096
你不是要赖账吧?
You're not backing out on me here?

1653
01:53:32,263 --> 01:53:33,963
不 我不是赖账 只是...
No, I'm not backing out. I just...

1654
01:53:34,057 --> 01:53:36,184
我想要种子 我没说不想要
I want the Seed. I'm not saying I don't want the Seed.

1655
01:53:36,267 --> 01:53:38,436
我只是说不知道...
I'm just saying I don't know if I...

1656
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,605
我是否现在就想要
if I want the Seed right now.

1657
01:53:40,939 --> 01:53:44,275
为了得到它 很多人付出了生命
Good men have died trying to get that thing for us.

1658
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,443
为了你
For you.

1659
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:48,029
我知道你付出很多才得到它
I know what you did to get that thing.

1660
01:53:48,112 --> 01:53:50,073
很多不法勾当
A lot of illegal, icky shit.

1661
01:53:50,448 --> 01:53:53,548
你也有把柄在我手上 所以你别威胁我
I can take you down, too, Mr. Black Ops. Don't you threaten me.

1662
01:53:54,285 --> 01:53:56,412
年轻的时候 我有个理想
I started this company when I was a boy,

1663
01:53:56,496 --> 01:53:59,165
想让世界变得更好 才开了这家公司
with a dream of making the world a better place.

1664
01:53:59,249 --> 01:54:01,918
有意思 我也有这个理想
Funny. I had the same dream.

1665
01:54:02,627 --> 01:54:06,089
但这么多年过去 你赚了好多钱
Somewhere along the way, you made billions of dollars.

1666
01:54:06,406 --> 01:54:09,056
而为什么我的理想就没实现呢?
So why don't you tell me what's missing from my dream?

1667
01:54:09,094 --> 01:54:11,994
为什么它就没能实现呢?
Why don't you tell me what's missing from my boyhood dream?

1668
01:54:12,762 --> 01:54:17,141
我最好的年华都在为祖国效力
I have served my country for decades of unparalleled prosperity

1669
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:20,019
你是我最后的稻草
and you are my golden parachute.

1670
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:23,856
所以你现在和我在一条船上!
So you are damn well jumping out of the plane with me!

1671
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:37,579
惊破天来了!
I am Galvatron!

1672
01:54:43,501 --> 01:54:46,254
- 怎么回事?  - 惊破天被激活了
- What's going on?  - Your Galvatron has gone active.

1673
01:54:47,672 --> 01:54:49,322
你有什么事瞒着我?
What haven't you been telling me?

1674
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:52,321
通知达茜 给我备车 悄悄地
Find Darcy, and bring a car around downstairs. Quietly.

1675
01:54:53,428 --> 01:54:55,709
工厂有紧急情况 我得走了
We got a factory emergency. I have to get you out of here.

1676
01:54:56,014 --> 01:54:58,364
- 发生了什么?  - 送他们出去
- What the hell's going on?  - Take them outside.

1677
01:54:58,402 --> 01:55:00,445
我们说好了的 你想要的已经给你了
We had a deal. You got what you wanted.

1678
01:55:01,019 --> 01:55:02,687
是"它"想要的
I got what "it" wanted.

1679
01:55:04,188 --> 01:55:08,693
兄弟们 今天你们自由了
My brothers, today I grant you your freedom.

1680
01:55:09,152 --> 01:55:13,865
从现在开始 你们听命于我
And from now on, you are commanded by me.

1681
01:55:14,824 --> 01:55:16,159
冲啊!
Rise up!

1682
01:55:18,202 --> 01:55:20,371
去找种子!
Go find my Seed!

1683
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:38,056
在最繁华的都市引爆种子
Detonate the Seed in the largest city.

1684
01:55:39,874 --> 01:55:41,994
好吧 我不想听"我早就说过"
Listen, princess. I don't wanna hear, "I told you so,"

1685
01:55:42,018 --> 01:55:44,218
但情况的确比我想的危险
but this is much more dangerous than I think.

1686
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,340
上车
Get in.

1687
01:55:51,736 --> 01:55:53,486
惊破天侵入了其它机器人
Galvatron's hacked into the others.

1688
01:55:53,524 --> 01:55:54,864
- 什么?  - 约书亚
- What?  - Joshua.

1689
01:55:54,947 --> 01:55:57,047
- 你得处理好这些!  - 快开车!
- You have to contain this!  - Drive, drive!

1690
01:55:57,085 --> 01:55:58,253
狗娘养的...
Son of a...

1691
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:03,081
快点 快走 快走!
Come on. Let's move, let's move, let's move!

1692
01:56:18,971 --> 01:56:20,821
我知道在香港怎么甩掉他们
I know how to lose them in Hong Kong.

1693
01:56:21,099 --> 01:56:23,601
那里有驻军会帮我们的
I know a military garrison there that will help us.

1694
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:27,146
威胁中情局的杀手
Threatening a professional CIA killer.

1695
01:56:28,106 --> 01:56:31,056
可不是我的特长 我不想再那么做了
Possibly not my finest hour. I'd like to have that one back.

1696
01:56:31,094 --> 01:56:33,152
杀手? 我以为他们是你朋友!
Killer? I thought they were your friends!

1697
01:56:33,361 --> 01:56:36,197
不是朋友 是生意伙伴 他们给了我这颗炸弹
No. Not friends. Business. They gave me this bomb.

1698
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:38,074
炸弹?
Bomb?

1699
01:56:38,157 --> 01:56:39,534
包里有炸弹?
Is there a bomb in the bag?

1700
01:56:39,617 --> 01:56:41,703
是的 包里有颗炸弹
Yes, there's a bomb in the bag.

1701
01:56:41,786 --> 01:56:42,870
该死
Shit.

1702
01:56:52,989 --> 01:56:55,639
你说你不想再帮助人类了
When you said you were done fighting for humans,

1703
01:56:55,677 --> 01:56:57,260
这不是你的真心话 对吧?
you didn't mean that, did you?

1704
01:56:57,343 --> 01:57:00,722
为了弥补你们犯下的错误
How many more of my kind must be sacrificed

1705
01:57:00,805 --> 01:57:03,141
我们要牺牲多少同胞?
to atone for your mistakes?

1706
01:57:03,349 --> 01:57:04,559
人类不就是这样吗?
Well, what do you think being human means?

1707
01:57:04,642 --> 01:57:05,727
我们就是这样
That's what we do.

1708
01:57:06,269 --> 01:57:07,770
经常做错事
We make mistakes.

1709
01:57:08,646 --> 01:57:11,846
但有时虽然犯了错 却能创造出杰作
And sometimes out of those mistakes come the most amazing things.

1710
01:57:16,779 --> 01:57:19,949
比如说我修好了你
When I fixed you, it was for a reward.

1711
01:57:20,283 --> 01:57:23,494
我是为了钱才那么做
That was it. That was why. For money.

1712
01:57:24,662 --> 01:57:26,873
那是我犯的一个错误
And it was me making a mistake.

1713
01:57:27,623 --> 01:57:29,876
如果我没有犯错 你就活不下来了
Without it, you wouldn't be here.

1714
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:36,340
所以就算你不相信我们 也请和我做一样的事情
So even if you got no faith in us, I'm asking you to do what I do.

1715
01:57:36,632 --> 01:57:39,582
我希望你能够看到我们身上的闪光点
I'm asking you to look at all the junk and see the treasure.

1716
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:44,307
你要对我们有信心 擎天柱 要信任我们的本性
You gotta have faith, Prime, in who we can be.

1717
01:57:51,103 --> 01:57:54,107
香港

1718
01:57:56,235 --> 01:57:58,835
一分钱都没有 我很不爽
I'm seriously pissed we're not getting paid for this.

1719
01:57:59,572 --> 01:58:01,908
最起码我们能干掉他
Well, at least we get to kill him.

1720
01:58:02,742 --> 01:58:05,542
只要卫星还能找到他 就跑不了
They're not getting away if I still got him on satellite.

1721
01:58:05,703 --> 01:58:08,372
某些人以为自己能骗过中情局
Some genius. Thinks he can outrun the CIA.

1722
01:58:10,208 --> 01:58:11,558
- 约书亚?  - 怎么了?
- Joshua?  - Yes?

1723
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:13,211
炸弹的威力有多大?
How lethal is that bomb?

1724
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,470
不知道 我查查
I don't know. Let me check.

1725
01:58:21,285 --> 01:58:23,935
我喜欢! 太赞了
I love this! This is so good.

1726
01:58:23,973 --> 01:58:25,099
等一下
Hang on.

1727
01:58:25,598 --> 01:58:28,434
老板从香港给我发短信了
I'm getting a text from Il Duce in Hong Kong.

1728
01:58:28,893 --> 01:58:31,270
"告诉我种子的爆炸影响范围"
"Need to know the Seed's estimated blast range."

1729
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:32,688
哦
Duh.

1730
01:58:42,031 --> 01:58:45,076
我来引开他们! 把那东西带到安全的地方!
I'll do the diversion! Get that thing somewhere safe!

1731
01:58:46,070 --> 01:58:48,076
- 嘿嘿嘿 这车多少钱啊  - 什么事啊

1732
01:58:48,076 --> 01:58:50,076
- 买你车啊，给你钱啊  - 买车？

1733
01:58:50,173 --> 01:58:52,773
杀手就要来了! 我们快走！
Killers are coming! Guys, we gotta go!

1734
01:58:53,084 --> 01:58:54,126
该走了...
Guys, guys...

1735
01:58:54,293 --> 01:58:55,795
- 闭嘴! 闭嘴!  - 好吧! 抱歉!
- Shut up! Shut up!  - All right! I'm sorry!

1736
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:57,420
好吧 快买!
All right, go ahead, go ahead!

1737
01:58:57,420 --> 01:58:58,420
你到底卖不卖啊 不卖不卖

1738
01:58:58,620 --> 01:59:00,120
你有没有搞错啊你 不卖啊走啦

1739
01:59:00,132 --> 01:59:02,593
买了吗? 别走啊! 等一下!
Okay, good? No, don't go! Wait!

1740
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:03,370
回来回来 卖啦卖啦

1741
01:59:03,469 --> 01:59:06,389
- 他同意了 - 衰啊你 - 好了
Okay, he's in. Okay, okay, okay.

1742
01:59:06,973 --> 01:59:08,975
我要涨工资! 我要涨工资
I need a raise! I want a raise.

1743
01:59:09,058 --> 01:59:11,158
好! 你说多少就多少!
All right, yes! I'm sure whatever you want!

1744
01:59:14,814 --> 01:59:15,857
快走!
Go, go, go!

1745
01:59:18,109 --> 01:59:19,110
不!
No!

1746
01:59:21,988 --> 01:59:24,138
要追上来了! 要追上来了!
Death is on our tail! Death is on our tail!

1747
01:59:30,997 --> 01:59:33,791
都给我让开! 快让开!
Get out of the way, all of you! Get out of the way!

1748
01:59:35,918 --> 01:59:37,712
我可不想这么死了
I don't want to die like this.

1749
01:59:53,311 --> 01:59:54,812
堵住他们
Box them in.

1750
02:00:08,659 --> 02:00:09,909
快点! 过来
Hurry, hurry! Come, come.

1751
02:00:09,952 --> 02:00:11,992
好的 我跟着你 你真厉害!
Okay, yes. I'll follow you anywhere. You're amazing!

1752
02:00:12,163 --> 02:00:13,913
你得到房顶去
We're going to get you to the roof.

1753
02:00:13,951 --> 02:00:14,952
好吧
Good, good.

1754
02:00:20,755 --> 02:00:21,839
进去!
Go!

1755
02:00:29,075 --> 02:00:30,343
温布利: 就像一颗战略导弹 哈哈哈!

1756
02:00:32,475 --> 02:00:34,143
哈哈哈 真逗
LOL. That's funny.

1757
02:00:35,019 --> 02:00:36,819
不敢相信... 这事真发生了
I can't... this is really happening.

1758
02:00:36,854 --> 02:00:40,858
像我这样拥有两百亿资产的任务
A man, me, who is worth over 20 billion dollars is now

1759
02:00:41,359 --> 02:00:44,862
现在却被中情局追杀 这是真的
being chased by CIA assassins. That's the truth.

1760
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:48,180
而且机器人还要造反
And in the middle of a robot uprising.

1761
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:53,829
而我正拿着一颗战略导弹
And I'm carrying what is, in essence, a tactical nuke.

1762
02:00:54,664 --> 02:00:57,514
最绝的是... 最绝的是我...
And the great thing is I... the great thing is that I'm...

1763
02:00:57,541 --> 02:00:59,085
我都没有倒时差
I'm barely feeling any jetlag.

1764
02:00:59,418 --> 02:01:00,711
- 别说了!  - 怎么了?
- Just stop it!  - What?

1765
02:01:01,045 --> 02:01:03,295
你得躲在房顶上
You need to hide on the roof of this building.

1766
02:01:03,333 --> 02:01:05,183
我帮你找直升机救你
I'll get you a helicopter extraction.

1767
02:01:07,551 --> 02:01:08,761
好吧
Okay.

1768
02:01:11,722 --> 02:01:13,057
我喜欢她
I like her.

1769
02:01:13,766 --> 02:01:15,116
她真有魅力
I find her very attractive.

1770
02:01:16,936 --> 02:01:18,836
他肯定就在附近
He's definitely around here.

1771
02:01:19,397 --> 02:01:20,398
拜托了
Come on, come on.

1772
02:01:22,858 --> 02:01:24,360
我找到摩托车了!
I got a bike!

1773
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:26,362
仔细搜查!
Check in there!

1774
02:01:26,862 --> 02:01:29,062
他们就是我说的中情局杀手
These are the CIA assassins I told you about.

1775
02:01:31,325 --> 02:01:32,410
哇!
Whoa!

1776
02:01:32,952 --> 02:01:34,495
- 朋友  - 跟我们走吧
- Guys.  - Let's go.

1777
02:01:35,788 --> 02:01:36,789
你们好
Hello.

1778
02:01:43,504 --> 02:01:44,922
嘿! 好吧
Hey! Okay.

1779
02:01:51,971 --> 02:01:53,771
- 拿着它  - 好的
- Pick it up.  - All right. I'm gonna.

1780
02:02:07,445 --> 02:02:08,487
哇
Wow.

1781
02:02:09,572 --> 02:02:13,200
哇 谢谢 哇! 你怎么...
Wow. Wow, thank you. Wow! How did you...

1782
02:02:13,492 --> 02:02:15,703
警校毕业 在读工商管理硕士之前
Police training, prior to my MBA.

1783
02:02:16,579 --> 02:02:17,663
我好爱你
I love you.

1784
02:02:19,123 --> 02:02:20,249
到屋顶去
Get to the roof.

1785
02:02:20,541 --> 02:02:21,542
好的
All right, okay.

1786
02:03:16,472 --> 02:03:19,141
去给我找种子 它就在附近!
Find my Seed. It's here!

1787
02:03:19,642 --> 02:03:21,852
那些机器人正在找炸弹
Those prototypes are after that bomb.

1788
02:03:30,361 --> 02:03:31,403
不!
No!

1789
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:34,073
不 不!
No, no, no, no!

1790
02:03:38,035 --> 02:03:39,385
飞机上的是谁?
Who the hell's aboard that?

1791
02:03:39,703 --> 02:03:41,205
不可能啊
Impossible.

1792
02:03:48,879 --> 02:03:53,425
兄弟们 是汽车人! 把他们打下来!
Brothers, it's the Autobots! Shoot them down!

1793
02:03:58,889 --> 02:03:59,932
约书亚!
Joshua!

1794
02:04:00,015 --> 02:04:01,100
嘿 光头!
Hey, Baldy!

1795
02:04:01,475 --> 02:04:02,768
嘿 是我! 嘿!
Hey, it's me! Hey!

1796
02:04:03,018 --> 02:04:04,418
带着它! 我们走
Bring it over now! Let's go.

1797
02:04:05,229 --> 02:04:06,772
快跑!
Hurry up, run!

1798
02:04:07,148 --> 02:04:09,348
- 快跑!  - 我们走! 快点!
- Hurry! Come on!  - Let's go! Move it!

1799
02:04:09,386 --> 02:04:11,805
快点 把它给我!
Guys! Come on. Give it to me now!

1800
02:04:12,236 --> 02:04:14,186
看来我们有伴了
Looks like we might have company.

1801
02:04:24,081 --> 02:04:25,708
被击中了! 被击中了!
We're hit! We're hit!

1802
02:04:51,692 --> 02:04:54,528
他们不死 我们就得死
They live, they talk, we're dead.

1803
02:04:55,279 --> 02:04:57,281
- 把他们全都杀了  - 明白
- Kill them all.  - Pleasure.

1804
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:01,785
我数到十!
I count ten below!

1805
02:05:02,953 --> 02:05:05,073
我记得你说只有一个机器人被污染
I thought you said you had one prototype get infected.

1806
02:05:05,289 --> 02:05:07,639
看来他现在又控制了其余的五十个
Now he's got operational control of my other 50.

1807
02:05:07,677 --> 02:05:08,761
过来
Come on.

1808
02:05:10,377 --> 02:05:12,463
快爬上去!
Climb, climb!

1809
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:14,882
把他们包围
Surround them.

1810
02:05:19,470 --> 02:05:22,570
世界末日可能是我造成的 但你竟然带了家人
I may have started the apocalypse, but you brought your family.

1811
02:05:22,608 --> 02:05:24,658
这可不是好家长会做的事
And that's, you know, terrible parenting.

1812
02:05:24,683 --> 02:05:26,227
我真想一拳把你打晕
I'm about one second away from knocking you out,

1813
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:27,603
拿着炸弹离开这里
taking the bomb, and just leaving you here.

1814
02:05:27,686 --> 02:05:29,104
那样最好了
Please, do me a favor.

1815
02:05:29,563 --> 02:05:32,066
擎天柱 汽车人 你们没事吧?
Optimus, Autobots, you alive?

1816
02:05:32,149 --> 02:05:33,799
- 来吧!  - 来吧!
- Come on, bitch!  - Come on!

1817
02:05:45,788 --> 02:05:46,997
撤退! 撤退!
Evac! Evac!

1818
02:05:47,164 --> 02:05:48,582
我们被夹击了!
We're getting flanked!

1819
02:05:50,251 --> 02:05:51,669
楼下有敌人!
We got company below!

1820
02:05:54,922 --> 02:05:58,634
我屁股卡住了! 大黄蜂 干掉他们!
My fat ass is stuck! Bee, take the shot!

1821
02:06:08,978 --> 02:06:10,728
- 快进电梯!  - 好的
- Into the elevator! Get in.  - Okay.

1822
02:06:10,766 --> 02:06:11,809
快点
Come on.

1823
02:06:15,025 --> 02:06:16,443
快下去!
Get down, get down!

1824
02:06:17,152 --> 02:06:19,652
把门关上! 把门关上!
Close the door! Close the door!

1825
02:06:21,490 --> 02:06:22,992
动不了! 门关不上!
Won't go! It's not closing!

1826
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:24,493
超重了
There's too much weight.

1827
02:06:24,702 --> 02:06:26,652
- 你们去找大黄蜂!  - 别出去 爸!
- Get back down to Bumblebee!  - Dad, no!

1828
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:29,109
嘿! 你要找的是我!
Hey! You want me!

1829
02:06:39,466 --> 02:06:40,467
中央电梯
Center elevator.

1830
02:06:40,718 --> 02:06:42,052
中央电梯
Center elevator.

1831
02:06:46,390 --> 02:06:47,975
他不会有事的
He's gonna be okay.

1832
02:07:01,238 --> 02:07:03,574
有炸弹! 有炸弹! 都让开!
Alien bomb! Alien bomb, coming through!

1833
02:07:04,033 --> 02:07:05,883
都让开! 都... 嗨 小朋友
Clear the way! Clear the... hi, kids.

1834
02:07:05,921 --> 02:07:07,369
让一让 女士们!
Coming through, ladies!

1835
02:07:07,578 --> 02:07:09,788
借过! 借过 女士们!
Excuse me! Excuse me, ladies! Excuse me!

1836
02:07:09,955 --> 02:07:10,956
天啊!
My God!

1837
02:07:11,123 --> 02:07:13,923
"都给我让开"用中文怎么说?
How do you say, "Get the fuck out of the way" in Chinese?

1838
02:07:58,003 --> 02:08:00,339
这里可是很高啊
That's a long way down.

1839
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:04,700
没有搞错吧
You've got to be kidding me.

1840
02:08:06,595 --> 02:08:07,846
不!
No!

1841
02:08:20,526 --> 02:08:21,610
拜托
Come on.

1842
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:30,828
哇哦!
Whoa!

1843
02:08:33,705 --> 02:08:35,040
我来抓你了!
I'm coming for you!

1844
02:09:10,325 --> 02:09:12,125
你不该把卡车藏起来
Never should have hidden that truck.

1845
02:09:12,369 --> 02:09:14,469
你不该追杀我家人
You should have never came after my family.

1846
02:09:14,507 --> 02:09:17,343
真倒霉 伊格尔 我们都有家人
Tough luck, Yeager. We all have family.

1847
02:09:17,833 --> 02:09:19,683
对 但我能活着见到我的
Yeah, but I'm gonna live to see mine.

1848
02:09:43,066 --> 02:09:45,861
我那些逃走的犯人在哪儿?
Where is my escaped bounty?

1849
02:09:45,944 --> 02:09:47,738
汽车人在这里
Autobots at this location.

1850
02:09:48,405 --> 02:09:50,073
擎天柱也快来了
Prime is close.

1851
02:09:51,742 --> 02:09:53,452
做你该做的
Do whatever you have to do.

1852
02:09:54,912 --> 02:09:56,413
我知道
I intend to.

1853
02:09:58,957 --> 02:10:00,584
- 达茜!  - 约书亚!
- Darcy!  - Joshua!

1854
02:10:00,792 --> 02:10:01,835
那边还有三个过来了
We got three more coming in from that way!

1855
02:10:02,085 --> 02:10:03,712
大黄蜂 泰莎在哪?
Bee, where's Tessa?

1856
02:10:04,755 --> 02:10:05,756
爸爸!
Dad!

1857
02:10:08,675 --> 02:10:11,887
我们遇到难题了 知道吗? 我制造出了无与伦比的机器人
We got a real dilemma here. Okay? I created incredible robots.

1858
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:14,570
都是为了打败这些变形金刚的
It's all designed to kick that fat Transformer's ass.

1859
02:10:14,598 --> 02:10:17,351
所以 真的 我们输定了
So, really, this is a no-win situation.

1860
02:10:17,434 --> 02:10:18,685
结束了
It's over.

1861
02:10:18,769 --> 02:10:19,770
这话太伤人
That was mean.

1862
02:10:19,978 --> 02:10:23,273
嘿! 我很抱歉 但这是事实嘛!
Hey! I'm sorry if you can't handle the cold-hearted truth!

1863
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:26,151
擎天柱 我该拿这些人类怎么办?
Optimus, what are my orders with these humans?

1864
02:10:26,235 --> 02:10:27,569
我能压扁这个光头吗?
Can I squish the bald guy?

1865
02:10:27,653 --> 02:10:29,071
他们遇到麻烦了
They're in trouble.

1866
02:10:29,154 --> 02:10:30,948
管他呢! 这不是我们的战争!
Nah! This isn't our fight!

1867
02:10:31,031 --> 02:10:33,825
我受够做丧家犬了 真是太气人了!
I'm done being an underdog. Underdogs suck!

1868
02:10:33,909 --> 02:10:35,744
要我说就该教训教训他们
I say they get what they deserve.

1869
02:10:35,827 --> 02:10:37,287
你说呢 擎天柱?
What's the play, Prime?

1870
02:10:37,496 --> 02:10:40,374
是时候找些援军来了
It's time for reinforcements.

1871
02:10:42,709 --> 02:10:45,879
去召唤骑士吧
Recognize one of your Knights.

1872
02:11:06,411 --> 02:11:08,986
唤醒你的同伴来接受骑士确认吧

1873
02:11:16,243 --> 02:11:17,619
快走
Come on.

1874
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:20,914
好的 走吧! 快 我们走!
All right, come on! Come on, let's go!

1875
02:11:21,164 --> 02:11:22,332
大黄蜂 快走!
Bee, go!

1876
02:11:26,837 --> 02:11:29,006
快 动起来! 快走 行动!
Come on, we got to move! Let's go, move!

1877
02:11:32,759 --> 02:11:35,220
泰莎呢? 泰莎 快过来! 快
Where's Tessa? Tessa, get over here! Come on.

1878
02:11:35,304 --> 02:11:36,597
这边来!
Get over here!

1879
02:11:37,264 --> 02:11:39,214
跟在我身后! 我掩护你!
Stay behind me! I'm covering you!

1880
02:11:39,266 --> 02:11:41,643
如果我不掩护你了 那说明我死了
If I stop covering you, it means I'm dead.

1881
02:11:41,727 --> 02:11:43,127
但那不会发生的
But that ain't gonna happen.

1882
02:11:44,313 --> 02:11:45,647
吃我一枪!
Take that!

1883
02:11:47,858 --> 02:11:50,360
我是个邪恶的汽车人战士!
I'm a wicked warrior robot!

1884
02:11:51,111 --> 02:11:52,112
该死!
Goddamn!

1885
02:11:52,446 --> 02:11:53,796
快! 马上走!
Come on! We gotta move now!

1886
02:11:55,198 --> 02:11:56,283
走 走!
Go, go!

1887
02:12:02,623 --> 02:12:04,666
敌人从街上追来了!
We got hostiles coming down the street!

1888
02:12:06,376 --> 02:12:07,377
快走!
Go!

1889
02:12:12,215 --> 02:12:14,217
大黄蜂! 十二点方向! 火力掩护!
Bee! Twelve o'clock! Cover fire!

1890
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:19,973
我们被包围了!
We're surrounded!

1891
02:12:20,057 --> 02:12:21,207
快 快 快!
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

1892
02:12:21,683 --> 02:12:22,726
小心火箭!
Rocket!

1893
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:24,603
走 走 走!
Go, go, go!

1894
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:25,896
趴下!
Get down!

1895
02:12:28,899 --> 02:12:30,799
这真是绝佳藏身之地啊
This is the perfect place to hide.

1896
02:12:30,837 --> 02:12:34,549
一个大玻璃箱! 谁也找不到我们! 真是...
A big glass box! Nobody will ever find us here! That's...

1897
02:12:37,115 --> 02:12:39,284
开什么玩笑
You've got to be kidding me.

1898
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:44,081
传奇战士们 创造了我们的力量
Legendary warriors, the powers that created us

1899
02:12:44,164 --> 02:12:46,917
如今想消灭我们
now want us all extinguished.

1900
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:51,296
我们必须团结起来 否则就只能永远沦为奴隶
We must join forces, or else forever be their slaves.

1901
02:12:52,839 --> 02:12:55,926
所以今天要么做战友...
So today you stand with us...

1902
02:12:56,134 --> 02:12:59,930
要么做敌人
or you stand against me.

1903
02:13:06,937 --> 02:13:08,772
这里交给擎天柱了
We'll let Prime figure this one out.

1904
02:13:08,855 --> 02:13:10,065
非常明智
Very wise.

1905
02:13:10,232 --> 02:13:12,982
我才不会留下来跟他们搅和呢
There's no friggin' way I'm staying down here with them.

1906
02:13:13,020 --> 02:13:14,271
没门 没门
No way. No way.

1907
02:13:19,491 --> 02:13:23,328
只有团结方可存活!
Only together can we survive!

1908
02:13:24,788 --> 02:13:26,123
让我来领导你们!
Let me lead you!

1909
02:13:38,135 --> 02:13:39,386
不好
No.

1910
02:13:39,469 --> 02:13:41,722
我以为会是辆大汽车
I was expecting a giant car.

1911
02:13:41,972 --> 02:13:43,306
来吧!
Come here!

1912
02:13:49,479 --> 02:13:51,773
我们在给你自由
We're giving you freedom.

1913
02:14:07,998 --> 02:14:10,709
保卫我的家人
You defend my family,

1914
02:14:12,669 --> 02:14:14,421
否则受死
or die.

1915
02:14:17,424 --> 02:14:19,009
汽车人
Autobots,

1916
02:14:19,217 --> 02:14:23,847
我们要证明自己的实力以及我们为何在此
we're going to prove who we are and why we're here!

1917
02:14:25,056 --> 02:14:27,434
你就是想为那个人死
You just want to die for the guy.

1918
02:14:27,517 --> 02:14:30,687
这就是领导 或者洗脑 或随便什么说辞
That's leadership. Or brainwashing, or something.

1919
02:14:30,771 --> 02:14:34,524
不 这是擎天柱
No. That's Optimus Prime.

1920
02:14:40,614 --> 02:14:43,366
汽车人 我们要一齐冲锋陷阵!
Autobots, we charge together!

1921
02:14:44,910 --> 02:14:46,453
现在 出发!
Now, roll out!

1922
02:14:49,039 --> 02:14:51,839
我们被围起来了! 四面都在攻击!
We're getting boxed in! We're getting flanked everywhere!

1923
02:14:51,875 --> 02:14:53,168
帮帮我!
Help me out here!

1924
02:14:53,251 --> 02:14:54,501
任何活物都格杀勿论!
Kill anything that moves!

1925
02:14:55,462 --> 02:14:57,339
快 凯德 开枪!
Come on, Cade, shoot!

1926
02:14:59,049 --> 02:15:00,849
尝尝我的厉害 小贱人!
Come and get some, you little bitch!

1927
02:15:00,887 --> 02:15:02,221
来了!
Incoming!

1928
02:15:06,616 --> 02:15:08,576
不敢相信我竟然把命交到你手里
I can't believe I'm putting my life in your hands.

1929
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:09,880
给你 别客气 拿上枪
Here. Be my guest. Take the gun.

1930
02:15:09,976 --> 02:15:10,977
- 来啊 拿着  - 不 我不想要枪
- Go ahead, take it.  - No, I don't want the gun.

1931
02:15:11,061 --> 02:15:12,062
- 来嘛 让你做主  - 不 我不要拿枪
- Come on, you can lead.  - No, I don't want the gun.

1932
02:15:12,229 --> 02:15:13,929
那就老实呆着闭嘴!
Then stay under there and shut up!

1933
02:15:13,967 --> 02:15:16,517
好吧 你会玩枪 所以你留着吧
All right. You're good with the gun. So you keep it.

1934
02:15:20,195 --> 02:15:22,572
枪绝弹尽了
Running out of guns and ammo.

1935
02:15:30,664 --> 02:15:33,333
尝尝老子的厉害!
Come and get some!

1936
02:15:33,583 --> 02:15:36,294
你们都死定了!
You're all gonna die!

1937
02:15:56,982 --> 02:15:58,483
干得漂亮 宝贝!
Way to go, baby!

1938
02:15:59,526 --> 02:16:00,944
枪法不错 凯德!
Good shooting, Cade!

1939
02:16:02,779 --> 02:16:08,493
我像芭蕾舞女一样 旋转扒皮割喉咙!
I'm like a fat ballerina who takes scalps and slits throats!

1940
02:16:15,625 --> 02:16:17,210
抽中下下签了吧!
Got your fortune cookie!

1941
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:20,338
去死吧 小废物
Come here, you little punk.

1942
02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:26,970
拉开火线! 我快顶不住了!
Pull the pin! I'm dying out here!

1943
02:16:27,262 --> 02:16:28,412
给! 拿着 拿着!
Here! Take it. Take it!

1944
02:16:28,450 --> 02:16:30,251
帮下忙! 帮下忙!
Little help! Little help!

1945
02:16:30,436 --> 02:16:32,076
点着了! 着了 着了 快拿走!
It's live! It's live, it's live. Take it!

1946
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:33,800
你给我干嘛?
What do you want me to do with it?

1947
02:16:33,838 --> 02:16:35,673
- 扔出去啊!  - 给我 给我!
- Just throw it!  - Give, give, give!

1948
02:16:49,117 --> 02:16:50,667
坏消息 凯德
Got some bad news, Cade.

1949
02:16:51,036 --> 02:16:53,663
我没有子弹 也没有主意了
I'm out of ammo and out of ideas.

1950
02:17:03,173 --> 02:17:05,133
再快点! 快!
Faster! Go!

1951
02:17:12,641 --> 02:17:14,017
我要杀了你!
I'll kill you!

1952
02:17:43,380 --> 02:17:45,048
冲啊!
Charge!

1953
02:17:56,226 --> 02:17:58,812
不 不可能!
No, impossible!

1954
02:17:58,895 --> 02:18:01,189
他们把一切都毁了!
They're ruining everything!

1955
02:18:02,232 --> 02:18:03,233
吃我一拳!
Take that!

1956
02:18:10,907 --> 02:18:12,075
给我滚开
Get off me.

1957
02:18:13,743 --> 02:18:15,693
- 起来 探长!  - 我不行了
- Get up, Hound!  - I can't go on.

1958
02:18:15,731 --> 02:18:17,163
但你要继续战斗啊!
But you gotta keep fighting!

1959
02:18:17,247 --> 02:18:18,748
油箱空了 兄弟
Tank's empty, bro.

1960
02:18:19,219 --> 02:18:21,060
外面还有很多敌人 如果你不起来战斗
There's more of 'em coming. If you don't get up

1961
02:18:21,084 --> 02:18:23,084
我们会死的 快点!
and fight, we're going to die. Let's go!

1962
02:18:27,757 --> 02:18:29,259
进攻!
Attack!

1963
02:18:33,304 --> 02:18:34,973
擎天柱来了!
Optimus is here!

1964
02:18:46,109 --> 02:18:47,777
大黄蜂 跳起来!
Bee, jump!

1965
02:20:08,316 --> 02:20:10,193
我讨厌山寨货
I hate cheap knockoffs.

1966
02:20:12,362 --> 02:20:13,446
干得漂亮!
Awesome job!

1967
02:20:13,530 --> 02:20:15,406
- 你  - 谁?
- You.  - Who?

1968
02:20:15,490 --> 02:20:16,990
- 你  - 过来
- You.  - Step forward.

1969
02:20:17,158 --> 02:20:18,159
慢着 为什么?
Wait. Why?

1970
02:20:18,243 --> 02:20:22,580
你的科研要为人类灭绝负责任
Your science will be responsible for humanity's extinction.

1971
02:20:22,789 --> 02:20:27,836
好吧 我知道你对生命伦理这事很敏感
All right. I know that you're sensitive to this whole bioethical dilemma.

1972
02:20:28,044 --> 02:20:29,087
或许他只是想听你说
Maybe all he wants to hear you say is

1973
02:20:29,170 --> 02:20:31,220
有的东西根本不该发明出来
that some things should never be invented.

1974
02:20:35,385 --> 02:20:36,469
好吧
Okay.

1975
02:20:37,011 --> 02:20:38,561
我们带你离开这座城市
We'll lead you out of the city.

1976
02:20:38,638 --> 02:20:41,724
把种子安全送到山里
Get that Seed safely to the hills.

1977
02:20:41,808 --> 02:20:43,226
坐这辆车
Use this car.

1978
02:20:43,434 --> 02:20:44,727
他差点吃了我!
He almost ate me!

1979
02:20:47,689 --> 02:20:49,023
好的 能开!
All right, we're good!

1980
02:20:49,607 --> 02:20:50,608
好了 我们走!
All right, let's go!

1981
02:20:52,777 --> 02:20:54,177
给我从驾驶位上让开
Get out of that seat.

1982
02:20:55,363 --> 02:20:57,198
有我这样的儿子你很幸运
And you're one lucky dad to have me.

1983
02:20:58,867 --> 02:21:01,578
好吧 幸运小帅哥 没问题 你开车 我们走
Okay, Lucky Charms. You got that. You drive. Let's go.

1984
02:21:12,714 --> 02:21:13,756
你干嘛了?
What did you do?

1985
02:21:13,923 --> 02:21:16,426
我不知道 但肯定有问题
I don't know. I don't know, but it's an issue.

1986
02:21:16,634 --> 02:21:17,844
- 你按到按钮了吗?  - 会爆炸吗?
- Did you press a button?  - Is it gonna blow up?

1987
02:21:17,927 --> 02:21:18,928
不知道
I don't know.

1988
02:21:19,042 --> 02:21:21,323
你那东西开始响了 所以你肯定碰到什么了
Your thing is beeping now, so you must have hit something.

1989
02:21:21,347 --> 02:21:23,057
- 会爆炸吗?  - 我不知道!
- Is it gonna blow up?  - I don't know!

1990
02:21:23,183 --> 02:21:25,351
炸弹在响 肯定说明有问题 还用想吗?
A bomb starts beeping, that might signal a problem, you think?

1991
02:21:25,435 --> 02:21:28,104
我的意思是它是个稳步闪光信号灯
I'm just saying that it's a steady blinking light,

1992
02:21:28,188 --> 02:21:29,988
可能是在计时之类的
which could be a timer of some kind.

1993
02:21:30,773 --> 02:21:32,734
也可能在发送位置信号
Unless it's signaling location.

1994
02:21:34,110 --> 02:21:35,278
给谁?
To who?

1995
02:21:41,278 --> 02:21:42,278
他从那边来了

1996
02:21:43,203 --> 02:21:45,653
我们得向中央政府请求帮助!
We've got to call the Central Government for help!

1997
02:21:45,753 --> 02:21:46,653
我现在就打

1998
02:21:47,053 --> 02:21:47,853
走啊 快点

1999
02:21:50,752 --> 02:21:52,879
擎天柱
Optimus Prime.

2000
02:21:54,297 --> 02:21:56,716
来找我吧
Come to me.

2001
02:22:15,316 --> 02:22:16,216
我靠

2002
02:22:44,297 --> 02:22:47,716
中国 北京

2003
02:22:56,526 --> 02:22:57,527
部长...

2004
02:22:57,902 --> 02:22:59,654
紧急事件!

2005
02:23:01,654 --> 02:23:02,555
我是国防部长

2006
02:23:04,158 --> 02:23:07,058
中央政府一定会全力支援香港

2007
02:23:07,096 --> 02:23:08,765
战斗机已经起飞了

2008
02:23:15,211 --> 02:23:16,212
就是这座桥
There's the bridge.

2009
02:23:34,897 --> 02:23:36,297
退后! 退后!
Back it up! Back it up!

2010
02:23:36,399 --> 02:23:39,944
快 快 快! 倒车! 回去! 回去!
Go, go, go, go! Back up! Go back! Go back!

2011
02:23:40,028 --> 02:23:42,228
快! 闪开 我看不到了!
Move! Get out of the way. I can't see!

2012
02:23:42,266 --> 02:23:44,516
- 肖恩 开快点!  - 好 淡定
- Shane, drive faster!  - Okay, just calm down.

2013
02:23:56,085 --> 02:23:58,335
- 肖恩 小心!  - 哇 哇!
- Shane, watch out!  - Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2014
02:24:00,923 --> 02:24:02,773
- 躲起来!  - 倒车! 倒车!
- Get cover!  - Back up! Back! Back up!

2015
02:24:08,014 --> 02:24:09,766
汽车人 后退!

我们没有家了 爸爸
We don't have a home, Dad.

2129

但当你仰望星空的时候
But whenever you look to the stars,

2144
02:36:10,819 --> 02:36:13,030
就把其中一颗

2145
02:36:14,031 --> 02:36:15,824
当成我的灵魂吧

保卫这家人 汽车人
Defend this family, Autobots,

2147

2152
02:36:42,726 --> 02:36:46,730
但我们是谁 为何在此
But who we are and why we are here

2153
02:36:47,606 --> 02:36:49,608
不在其列

2154
02:36:50,234 --> 02:36:54,279
我们心中自有答案
