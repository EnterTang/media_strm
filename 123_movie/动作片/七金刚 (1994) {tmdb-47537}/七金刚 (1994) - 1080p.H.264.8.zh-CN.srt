1
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,494
Robbery. Don't move

2
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,841
Be quick, you fool

3
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,581
Careful

4
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,066
Six consecutive robberies

5
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,758
in Nathan Road

6
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,733
The gang escapes...

7
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,202
towards the border now

8
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,560
Stand still, or I'll shoot

9
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:43,393
Inside Chinese territory at last

10
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,561
What can you do to us?

11
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,601
See you after 1997

12
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:58,345
Robbing 6 shops in 13 minutes

13
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,449
Clean methods

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,485
They used Viet automatic pistols,

15
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,548
and Soviet V3 grenade

16
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,890
Can they be our cadets?

17
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,828
School dropout maybe

18
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:09,888
Superman, what do you think?

19
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,462
Surely win, except Nanny

20
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,325
Nanny?

21
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,192
I'm waiting for you guys only

22
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:15,993
No guns this time

23
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,295
To seize them within 1 3 minutes, OK?

24
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,501
No problem

25
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,500
See who'll lose

26
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,425
Wait for me

27
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,223
Why it swings?

28
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,396
Damned. I'm too heavy

29
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,932
to jump...

30
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,227
such high fences

31
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,835
Bastards' idea

32
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:58,733
Some motorbikes coming

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,208
Run

34
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,044
Superman, join forces?

35
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,681
I'm OK on my own

36
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,583
Leave me

37
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,049
Goodnight

38
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,355
You'll lose for sure

39
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,687
You cheat

40
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,638
Boomerang

41
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,872
Ferocious gale. Shit

42
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,223
Try my archery skills

43
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:50,991
Flying Dragon Kick

44
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,667
If you can avoid me,

45
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,942
then I can't be Archet Tiny

46
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,884
Blazing wheels

47
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,355
Bear in mind, I'm Dragon

48
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,534
Eighteenth dragon kicks

49
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,201
Shao Lin Monk at your service

50
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,783
Another fool

51
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,176
Don't move

52
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,011
Go away, fatty

53
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,744
Calm down, your hands shake

54
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,056
Your mouth is parched,

55
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,350
hands sweating, weak limbs

56
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:53,253
To hold a gun like this

57
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,155
It is dangerous

58
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,488
Listen to me. Go and confess

59
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,191
Put down your gun

60
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,691
Shut up and go to hell

61
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:02,732
Want a fight?

62
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,298
Dare to shoot Nanny,
the best doctor of China

63
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,422
Thunderous thrust

64
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,759
Spinning

65
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,194
Snake moves

66
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,297
Watch my fist

67
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,935
In 3 minutes, I like breaking records

68
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,240
Stay. It's grenade

69
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,074
Move and you'll die

70
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,145
Who are these guys?

71
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,614
Who bind them?

72
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:53,542
Report to headquarters

73
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,276
Yes sir

74
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,119
As the Special Force Squad

75
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,822
We always emphasize impartiality

76
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,051
Any offense will be penalized,

77
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,591
even when stationed abroad

78
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,828
Steelbar, according to military rules,

79
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,863
I'll use level 3 penalty. Any objection?

80
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,501
I'm betrayed

81
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,767
That's slander

82
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,169
We've always been good pals

83
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,340
Don't make excuses

84
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:26,169
Execution

85
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:29,507
Superman, you have guts

86
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,979
Monk, you're cruel

87
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,879
Don't throw so hard

88
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,182
Tiny, you spiteful chit

89
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,446
No wonder you're single

90
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:37,321
None of your business

91
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,921
Nanny, give me back $5000

92
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,926
Superman, I won't forget this

93
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,225
A durian for you

94
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,321
You'll have your retribution!

95
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,100
Ha! In the water

96
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,968
Durian brings you bad luck

97
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,051
Girl bitten to death in Tai Po

98
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,352
Please hurry to the spot

99
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,661
In Chun Fung Street shopping centre
a man...

100
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,528
Can I have some peace?

101
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,723
Are you really a monk?

102
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:23,800
I'm taking out the spikes

103
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,367
I'm helping you

104
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,073
But you're tearing my hair

105
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,436
Just checking your scalp too

106
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,143
Come and taste roasted pork

107
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,238
It's really delicious

108
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,646
It's hot

109
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,347
Eat

110
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,450
It's real good

111
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,486
For our future restaurant

112
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,851
We all depend on this dish

113
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,393
Remember to pay the instalments on time

114
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,492
Don't sigh while you eat

115
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,423
Let me give you a puzzle,

116
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,897
see who've got the highest IQ

117
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,994
It's one of the human organs

118
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,067
Listen carefully

119
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:04,137
Pa, Mum can touch but not sister

120
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,505
Brother can but not sister

121
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,307
Grandma, can, Granny can't

122
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,243
Make a guess

123
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,941
I know

124
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,586
Stop! It's disgusting

125
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,445
What're you thinking?

126
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,254
There

127
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,585
Leave me alone. You're dirty

128
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,227
Fei, can you guess

129
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,326
Lips

130
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,861
Excellent! You're our leader indeed

131
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,256
Lips?

132
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,992
Whose lips?

133
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,768
Pa and Mum can touch,

134
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,165
but sister and brother can't

135
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,404
Fat Nanny,

136
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,472
Fat auntie can, uncle can't

137
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:39,435
Right

138
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,507
Fat Auntie can, uncle can't

139
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:43,740
Jacky Cheung can't

140
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,582
Mimi can touch twice

141
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,575
Funny

142
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,981
Nanny, more please

143
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,013
Someone's here

144
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:50,746
Move

145
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,308
Dragon, yours

146
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,276
Monk, yours

147
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:22,612
He's quite good

148
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:23,478
How do you know?

149
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,315
Let's give him a treat

150
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:24,852
Good

151
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,085
No more fooling around

152
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:30,827
Chief?

153
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:31,725
Colonel Yim,

154
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,865
what do you think of them?

155
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,665
Thanks God you stop them

156
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,704
Let me introduce comrade Yim

157
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,166
Colonel of southwestern army

158
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,907
He'll explain your mission later

159
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,337
They're...

160
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,310
HK based Special Forces Squad

161
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,341
Salute

162
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,847
Come on in

163
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,142
Here we go

164
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,615
Yeung, Major of SW army

165
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,588
He plots with US ammunition suppliers,

166
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,387
selling arms to terrorists

167
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,892
Last week he arrived in HK secretly

168
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,463
Planning to make another deal

169
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:09,427
Your duty is

170
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,867
to arrest Yeung

171
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,403
and to get all their bank cards

172
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,341
So, we can go to Bank of Switzerland

173
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,605
and open the safe deposit box

174
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,572
There're diamonds worth of $1 20 millions

175
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,041
It belongs to our country

176
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:27,882
How about our roles?

177
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,985
I've made arrangements

178
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,316
To be the beggars again?

179
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,224
You want to be the governor?

180
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,026
What about these suppliers?

181
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,331
They've got close ties with FBI?

182
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,257
No
It involves two competing governments

183
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,396
Use your assumed roles

184
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,401
Don't ever disclose your true identities

185
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,373
Sit down

186
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,076
Dragon, some news for you

187
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,606
You'll retire soon

188
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:56,904
Why?

189
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,750
We've found your mum...

190
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,782
in China

191
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:02,715
My mum?

192
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,479
Really?

193
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:04,452
Congratulations!

194
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,988
You're not orphan anymore

195
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,857
Chief, what's she like?

196
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,794
I've not seen her also

197
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,059
I know

198
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,863
Same as fat Nanny

199
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,333
What's bad about me?

200
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,463
For Dragon and Colonel! Cheer

201
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,400
Cheers...

202
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:34,519
Ready?

203
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,119
OK

204
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:36,513
OK

205
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:40,424
Let's play

206
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,487
I'm busy

207
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,193
Could you stop playing?

208
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,260
Listen

209
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,626
Look for a good position

210
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,401
For hiding and retreating

211
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,530
Don't play. I'll check over there

212
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,670
Yes sir

213
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,735
Hurry up. Is it OK?

214
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,639
Higher, a little bit more

215
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:26,870
What's bothering you?

216
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,497
Careful, miss

217
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,068
Look out!

218
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,646
Help! I can't swim

219
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,779
How can you try to save me?

220
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,088
I forgot I can't swim

221
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,893
Sure that I can?

222
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,093
Anyway, save me...

223
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,930
I don't have my swim suit

224
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,862
Bye!

225
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,083
My God

226
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,293
Answer me

227
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:29,929
I've got you

228
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,402
I thought you're smart

229
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,401
but tricked nonetheless

230
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,738
You're funny, I like that

231
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,777
You flirt girls often like this?

232
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,648
Only this time

233
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,445
Looking for you?

234
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,088
Yes

235
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,245
I must go

236
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,581
Go and flirt more girls then

237
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,179
Brother, you swam?

238
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,243
What happened? You're wet

239
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:19,543
Come here

240
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,011
I tested these currents just now

241
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:22,947
Swim away,

242
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,180
if thing get worse tomorrow

243
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,387
How could he think so?

244
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,320
Why can't we take a boat?

245
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,460
It's more expensive

246
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,587
Let's go

247
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,593
Is it expensive taking a boat?

248
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:33,997
I make it

249
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,848
A balloon for you

250
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:57,919
Please support Arts Festival

251
00:15:58,757 --> 00:15:59,485
Any special programme?

252
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:00,647
Give your support please

253
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,259
Steelbar, suspicious persons

254
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,265
Leather coat,
sun glasses and mobile phones

255
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,338
They're behind you

256
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:15,430
Can you see?

257
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:16,906
Any others?

258
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,304
Yes, 2 men in suits

259
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,470
They look evil

260
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,443
It look there's much danger ahead

261
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,647
Are we exposed?

262
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,218
Attention! Some changes!

263
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,122
Forget the man in leather coat

264
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,384
He isn't our target

265
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,459
The 2 men had exposed themselves

266
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:40,995
They're blinds

267
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,967
We're in a good situation

268
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,196
What happened?

269
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,504
Nanny? I can't hear you

270
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,206
Brat, I'll kill you

271
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,483
What? Who to kill?

272
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,243
Kid, get lost

273
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,281
Stop playing with kids now

274
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,959
Situation is under control

275
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,890
Attention! Target appears

276
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:11,990
Where?

277
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,090
It's moving...

278
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,961
towards centre

279
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,266
He finds his confederate

280
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,099
Attention

281
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,207
Move to the left side of dragon head

282
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,113
Ready

283
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,544
They meet

284
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,052
Standby, everyone

285
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,714
Too many balloons block our sight

286
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:38,651
We can see now

287
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,816
A lady, long hair, dark glasses,

288
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,325
dressed in red

289
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:45,425
Let's go

290
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:52,866
Verified

291
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,510
Attention! "A shark is coming" Accidents

292
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,036
It's going to the "target"

293
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,051
Tsun

294
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,056
Why killed Yeung?

295
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:23,964
Raise the dragon

296
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:30,570
Come later

297
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:43,949
What happened

298
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,454
Tiny's ready to stop him

299
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:50,661
Get off

300
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:51,855
Untie strings

301
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,203
Where we go?

302
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,971
We don't know

303
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:16,718
Stay

304
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:17,881
Gigantic leap

305
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,885
Dragon spits

306
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,055
Dragon tail flies

307
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:25,892
Go to hell

308
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:31,562
Nanny raise dragon

309
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,203
Get it

310
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,167
Go

311
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:34,967
Flying dragon

312
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,242
Where to go?

313
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,171
It's you?

314
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:43,880
Surprise?

315
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,983
You like me, so! Chasing after me?

316
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,115
Give me the card

317
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:49,615
Get down

318
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,983
You're an obedient girl

319
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,787
I'm not free today

320
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,558
See you next time

321
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,571
Why killed Yeung? There's no such order

322
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,403
Our heads also want his share

323
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,039
They're afraid of a breakup with Chinese

324
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,308
So it's left for me

325
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,780
I did for the group only

326
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,151
They've a good reputation

327
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,180
You're cheated by those old devils

328
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,287
I've seen through their pretence

329
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:29,822
I don't want to argue

330
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,394
How you explain to Sun without the card?

331
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,989
I don't need to report to anyone

332
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,864
I know where it is

333
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,061
What about yours?

334
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,108
Ying, think about it

335
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,708
If we've those diamonds,

336
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,609
we'll be rich

337
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,050
You know what you're saying?

338
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,617
We'll have our babies

339
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,554
Get away

340
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,021
Keep in mind, we're only partners

341
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,687
What's mine is mine

342
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:14,133
1 died and 4 injured

343
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,499
Police suspected triad feud

344
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,974
Unbelievable, we as triads this time

345
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,348
Without those guys,

346
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,742
police may have traced to us

347
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,152
Nanny, gentler please

348
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,843
Stay

349
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:29,988
Don't twist

350
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,017
Even steps please

351
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,618
I've seen the design, no good

352
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:41,488
The kitchen faces west. Unlucky

353
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,532
As we rely on it for our livelihood

354
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,431
Let's tear it down

355
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:46,969
Nanny?

356
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:47,771
I don't mind,

357
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,930
do what you say

358
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,802
In catering industry,

359
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,071
relationship is what counts

360
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,449
Thus the post of manager

361
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,481
It should be mine

362
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,685
No, it's too much work for you

363
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,821
A double bonus for you. OK?

364
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,249
How about a good-looking secretary

365
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,685
It's all arranged,

366
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,484
3 days work only

367
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,926
Working hour are 1 0 to 4

368
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,861
It can be changed,
if you are not satisfied

369
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,029
Does it sound great?

370
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,361
It sounds too good to be true

371
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:20,869
What are you discussing?

372
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,500
Brother, is it done?

373
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:23,668
Sure

374
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:24,872
What's up?

375
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,267
Anything I shouldn't know?

376
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,412
Do you want to know?

377
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,282
Pay this month's instalment first

378
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,473
What a good memory

379
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,682
Help yourself. It's in my pocket

380
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,411
You always take the advantage

381
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,057
It's paid. What's up?

382
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,384
Nanny, tell him

383
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,186
We sold the shop

384
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,929
What? Sold it?

385
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,093
How about the money?

386
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,397
For Dragon to bring home

387
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,096
Our money goes for nothing,

388
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,566
and he takes all our money home?

389
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,204
It's unfair

390
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,167
He has a mother. So what?

391
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:55,897
I'm back

392
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,132
Shut up, Dragon's back

393
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:57,934
Help out

394
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,112
Good son, you bought so many things home

395
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,808
Isn't it great? Crazy shopping

396
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,579
How nice, a family reunion!

397
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,518
And we...

398
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,021
Shut up. You big mouth

399
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,718
Big mouth?

400
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,585
He's out of mind after dragon dance

401
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:16,352
Don't mind him

402
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,628
Dragon, we've something for you

403
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,161
What a coincidence! Me too

404
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,697
I want to take all my pension fund

405
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,961
to pay for the shop

406
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:25,962
To show my appreciation

407
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,162
Are you crazy?

408
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:28,697
Save it for rainy days

409
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,837
Get up. Stop complaining now

410
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,001
It sounds better

411
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,404
I thought that we'll have nothing left

412
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,941
But it's not that bad

413
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,511
The shop is our dream

414
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,672
If you do this

415
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,614
I won't be grateful and happy

416
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,149
Everyone has contributed

417
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,219
the shop will be opened somehow

418
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,290
Come and help us in your spare time

419
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,583
Right, we'll pay

420
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,855
Good. It's settled now

421
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,531
As you said. I'll be the manager

422
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:55,893
With double bonus

423
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:56,897
Lovely secretary

424
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,000
1 0 to 4

425
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,102
It's fixed

426
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:00,695
Who made this promise?

427
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,598
Not me

428
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,432
I don't know. I didn't say anything

429
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,574
Keep the words. Hey...

430
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,135
I promise you

431
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:05,639
Throw him into the water

432
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,226
A 7 years old girl lost in Kwun Tong

433
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,666
Anybody get it. Please report

434
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:34,468
Time's up

435
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,540
Suicide in 1 2 Ho Man Tin Road

436
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,869
Please go to the location. Over

437
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,068
How do you know I'm in good mood today?

438
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,567
We have the same mind

439
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,662
Aren't you waiting for me?

440
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,405
As we understand each other so much

441
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,308
Let's sit down and talk business

442
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,272
Good. Come over

443
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:17,841
Liar

444
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,051
Go? Our business isn't finished

445
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,512
Here's more comfortable

446
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,518
Try my whip

447
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,238
You're wonderful

448
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,467
So is your figure

449
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:48,572
Filthy

450
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,483
Go into the water

451
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,795
Not bad but it can be better

452
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,761
Let me pull you up

453
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:13,896
Show me

454
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,544
Your pose is awkful

455
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,306
Teach me then

456
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,648
Let us make a deal first

457
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,815
A big deal? Can we talk ashore?

458
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,679
No. You're cunning

459
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,890
Here is safer

460
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,180
OK, go ahead

461
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,718
Give me the card

462
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,952
We'll share its contents

463
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:38,991
AIright

464
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,399
Give me yours. I'll call you later

465
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,294
No sincerity

466
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:45,435
Take it out

467
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,834
You think I'm that dumb?

468
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,497
To hide the card here?

469
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,604
Name your conditions

470
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,771
Tell me first

471
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:56,704
How do you know our place?

472
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,883
Well. It's a trade secret

473
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,682
Exchange it with the card

474
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,357
Nothing to lose

475
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:07,985
I don't like to lose

476
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,522
What's your name? Dear client

477
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,060
Ying and you're Fei

478
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,132
It's my business name only

479
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,526
When are you free?

480
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,534
Wait until I'm in a good mood

481
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:35,448
Brother Tsun

482
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,885
Tsun,
the group appoints you to get the card

483
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,115
I don't care how you work it out

484
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,322
But I've to scrutinize your work

485
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,229
You know, certain things are laboo?

486
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,699
What I've done?

487
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,905
As the legal consultant of company

488
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,436
if you're charged of trafficking

489
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,837
We'll ignore you

490
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,141
We have our plans here

491
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,276
1 99 7 is coming

492
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,746
All quarters've their eyes here

493
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,105
We must consolidate...

494
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,615
our position

495
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,988
Is it worthy it
for such small sums of money?

496
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:14,221
Cocaine is found in his possession

497
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,451
He's your man. He's left to you

498
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,252
O.K.

499
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,459
Brother Tsun?

500
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,365
You know what to do?

501
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,802
Yes. I won't be that dumb

502
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,307
to have you stepped on my goods

503
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:34,806
What happened?

504
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:36,610
I've reserved...

505
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,980
a table for us

506
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,417
I've business with Sun

507
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,748
Be quick. I'll wait for you

508
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,519
What happening?

509
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,653
It's dangerous to appoint him

510
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,186
He did the cocaine business

511
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,849
Yes

512
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,293
What's your plan?

513
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,621
After you get back the cards

514
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,594
I'll have him transferred to US

515
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,297
He's out of control here

516
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,800
He's a mad dog. Be careful

517
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,333
So do you

518
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,737
Chief, our place has been searched today

519
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,077
They're fast

520
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,612
I suspect there're spies

521
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,916
Be more careful

522
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,052
I know

523
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,582
I've got details...

524
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,653
about these 2 Chinese

525
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,757
We've to get their card soonest

526
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,651
Of course you want to get away

527
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,658
So you don't have to bear with us

528
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,597
Chief have pity on us

529
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,359
Find us some relatives

530
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,829
You all should plan for your future

531
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,302
You're going to open a shop soon?

532
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,871
You've checked us also?

533
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:37,837
Not on purpose

534
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,669
I just admire you all

535
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,276
You wait for me

536
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,843
I'll hand this card to messenger

537
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,173
Dragon, go along with Chief

538
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,710
I'll be safer

539
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,016
I'll call you if anything happens

540
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,672
Chief, you like to join our venture?

541
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,200
I can't afford it

542
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,011
Messenger?

543
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,215
He's shot

544
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,747
Chief, it's dangerous here

545
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,946
No one should know about our coming here

546
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:33,860
Be strong

547
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,067
Run with the card

548
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,140
Chief

549
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,543
Don't go

550
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:07,889
Chief

551
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:13,730
Dragon

552
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:15,764
Dragon, where're you?

553
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:17,899
Dragon

554
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:34,058
Dragon...

555
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,234
Fei, what's up?

556
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:52,608
Who are you?

557
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,040
Why are you handcuffed

558
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:54,938
Where's Dragon and Chief?

559
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:56,941
Dragon's injured by my shot

560
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,343
Chief is dead

561
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,083
You shot Dragon

562
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,479
Calm down

563
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,782
Listen to him

564
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,087
Sergeant Cheung is
in charge of this case

565
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,052
I'll take the suspect

566
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,849
Yes, sir

567
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:10,890
Who are these guys?

568
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,320
Friends of the suspect

569
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,461
Tell them to leave

570
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:14,698
Or handcuff them as well

571
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:15,927
Get off

572
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,759
Stay

573
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:17,624
Where are you bringing him?

574
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,228
I don't need to explain

575
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,371
Take them along

576
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:21,801
Stop

577
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,236
Sergeant Cheung?

578
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:24,133
China News Agency!

579
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,068
Who's Sergeant Cheung?

580
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:25,866
I am

581
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,136
Agent of HK Government

582
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,904
They're members
of Chinese Security Bureau

583
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,139
This case is closed

584
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,007
Endorsed by the Commissioner of Police

585
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,515
All evidence will be transferred
to the Chinese

586
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,149
Hope your subordinates'll behave

587
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,483
We shouldn't always have
to clean up the mess

588
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,021
That's our business

589
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:44,688
Be smarter next time

590
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,391
You won't be needing us if you're smart

591
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:47,256
You're all talk!

592
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,890
Shut up! You're all under suspicion

593
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:51,825
Take Fei away

594
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:52,628
Yes

595
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:53,064
Let's go

596
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:53,669
I want to see Dragon

597
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,237
Suspect has no right to request

598
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:56,464
Colonel Yim

599
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,274
Grant him 5 minutes

600
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:00,541
I'll guarantee him

601
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,978
Wait for you outside

602
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,775
Open his handcuffs

603
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:07,480
Why was he beaten?

604
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:08,276
What's it to you?

605
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,784
He's shot before I hurt him

606
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,385
Dragon, wake up

607
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,623
Fei, you're in a messed up situation

608
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,485
If you don't tell the truth

609
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,960
I can't help you

610
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,261
I want to know too

611
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,593
Only Dragon has the facts

612
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,235
Still, you shouldn't have shot him

613
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,031
You think I hurt him intentionally?

614
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,068
You accusing me?

615
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:31,902
Monk, you judge

616
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,277
Amen

617
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,308
Damp

618
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,343
Amen? Shit

619
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,913
So you trust me?

620
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,708
I trust you

621
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:44,083
But the Superiors won't bend

622
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,754
Fei'll be charged
with stealing national secret

623
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,786
It'll be treason

624
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,592
But he's got no chance to plea

625
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,320
We work hard to you

626
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,028
I'll resign if you take him

627
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,462
We will too

628
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,098
As a Chinese security enforcer

629
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,294
One must obey the rules

630
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,469
Colonel, I'll go with you

631
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:04,567
Fei

632
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:05,333
Brother

633
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:06,602
Brother

634
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:07,636
Take care of Dragon

635
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:08,369
Fei

636
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,078
Too rash just now. Sorry

637
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,370
I know your temper

638
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:16,345
We'll think of something

639
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:28,929
When are we leaving Hong Kong?

640
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,632
We're nearing that border

641
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:50,854
Those scums

642
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:14,976
The truck's stolen

643
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:15,937
You thieves

644
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:17,243
What?

645
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,313
Nothing. Go to hell

646
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:21,910
Brother. Let's go

647
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:22,711
Fei

648
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,288
I don't plan to leave

649
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,251
You kidding?
After your play-acting in the hospital

650
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,059
We acted our parts well

651
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,292
I saw you making signs

652
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,294
Now the container is blasted

653
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,088
if you don't go

654
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,130
your charge'll double...

655
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:37,801
Someone is coming

656
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:38,661
Let's go

657
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,003
Leaving me so soon?

658
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,100
OK. I'll come with you

659
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:42,969
We're pals

660
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,104
Hurry to the hospital

661
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,104
Dragon's in deep danger

662
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:26,182
What happening?

663
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:30,410
Wheel him out

664
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,246
Use the back door

665
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:38,623
Unfortunate encounter

666
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,264
Let's separate

667
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,241
So you hasten your end

668
00:36:59,450 --> 00:36:59,848
Brother

669
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:00,483
Be careful!

670
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,628
Don't fall for the trap

671
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,699
The two fools are over there

672
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:18,863
After them

673
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:21,271
Ready

674
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:21,871
Dash

675
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,431
Give way

676
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,009
A million arrows

677
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,078
Shaolin kicks

678
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:35,408
Where're you wheeling the patient?

679
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,450
He's recovered

680
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,058
I'm taking a leak

681
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,717
No more fooling around

682
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:16,091
Move over

683
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,557
Catch him

684
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:24,959
Run

685
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:28,868
They've escaped

686
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,144
Abbot, sorry for disturbing you

687
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:40,982
Not at all, Amen

688
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:44,119
The monastery welcomes all

689
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:48,018
because of your generous support in past

690
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,317
Please feel free here

691
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,960
and make yourselves at home

692
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:52,720
Thanks

693
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,764
Boiling water

694
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:58,296
Thanks

695
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:01,896
Is the medicine ready?

696
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,441
Yes, but he's still unconscious

697
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:05,701
Warm it then

698
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:10,771
Nanny? How is it?

699
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:11,539
Will he awake?

700
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,307
Sure

701
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:13,177
He's got a blessed face

702
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,511
good forehead

703
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,414
Bright eyes

704
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:17,281
You can tell even with his eyes closed?

705
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,479
When'll he get up?

706
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:19,854
Ask him

707
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,024
Shit

708
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:21,925
Shit

709
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:24,553
Wake up soon, or I'll curse you

710
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:25,627
Sleep?

711
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:26,591
Our first priority...

712
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,527
is to get the gang's card

713
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,792
Then the lost card'll be useless

714
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,198
Don't waste any time

715
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:33,365
or we'll stay indefinitely

716
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,799
Attending to Dragon

717
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,967
Focus on the fellows in the hospital

718
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,268
Shadow them

719
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,272
Seize the chance

720
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,239
Fei, give up on that woman

721
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,607
What woman?

722
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,508
I'm worried about you

723
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,015
You're falling into their trap

724
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,217
What trap?

725
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,046
Right in front of you

726
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:52,086
Don't make guesses

727
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,283
I'm concerned

728
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,216
About what?

729
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,189
Beware of whom?

730
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,019
Have you nothing else to do?

731
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,125
Go on with your business

732
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:00,953
Let's eat

733
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,190
Better than being scolded

734
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:48,007
After Fei and his pals escaped

735
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,475
They carried off Dragon

736
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:51,578
No news yet

737
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,213
They'll focus on the gang

738
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:55,942
Cancel that region's arrest

739
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,314
Let's seize the real culprits

740
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,384
Shadow the pair

741
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,050
Call it off in 3 minutes

742
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,490
I taught you guys

743
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,191
I'll be waiting

744
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,004
Don't fail me

745
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,348
Thought it out?

746
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,183
Want a deal?

747
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:04,716
I brought the card

748
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,147
How do I know it isn't a trap?

749
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,887
How can I trust you?

750
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,586
I've got the card on me

751
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,260
It depends on your guts

752
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,631
This is my place

753
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:18,733
You ain't afraid of me using force?

754
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,229
Force?

755
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,099
You've seen my powers

756
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,665
It's crowded. Let's talk outside

757
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,415
There's a fly in here

758
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,049
Call them

759
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:36,977
The card?

760
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:37,881
Follow me home...

761
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,119
So you want me and not the card

762
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,259
I want the truth about the coliseum

763
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,722
You've come to the wrong place

764
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:16,517
Are you hurt?

765
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:19,219
Move...

766
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:22,858
Mommy

767
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:26,763
Don't fire

768
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:34,843
Get down

769
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:39,308
After them!

770
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,521
Shut down all exits

771
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:49,755
Follow me

772
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:05,668
Our man's here

773
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,910
Go south. You're rescued

774
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:10,972
Thanks

775
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,113
Fei

776
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:18,752
Take the gun

777
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,556
I thought you wanted the card

778
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,192
If I did,
I wouldn't be helping you escape

779
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:24,618
Take care

780
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,729
Be on your guard

781
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:41,303
Those aren't my men

782
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,273
They're from Security Bureau

783
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,239
Come to catch me

784
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:45,373
but they won't let you go either

785
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,342
Disgusting

786
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,352
You're surrounded

787
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,489
Don't resist

788
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:58,891
It'll be easier if you surrender

789
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,823
You've got no choice

790
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,291
Come out!

791
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,700
Fei, I know you're here

792
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,771
Don't resist

793
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:14,933
Come and surrender

794
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,742
It's crowded in here

795
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,382
Only one of us can stay

796
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:22,948
You're a smooth talker

797
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,848
but good-natured

798
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:25,454
I don't mind you staying here

799
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,347
If we stay longer,

800
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:28,752
you may grow fond of me

801
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,720
No excuses

802
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,627
To be truthful

803
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,788
I don't want to leave

804
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,066
Take this gun

805
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:42,869
Fei

806
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,373
The coliseum wasn't our fault

807
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:47,939
I didn't harm your friend

808
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,807
Teach me diving sometime

809
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,680
You lose

810
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,246
And you win?

811
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,146
Do you think you can escape?

812
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,782
You like to win by outnumbering

813
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,115
Pass the card

814
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:34,991
The penalty could be lighter

815
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,259
Discussing conditions already?

816
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:37,222
Afraid of me?

817
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,021
You want to fight with me

818
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:40,791
OK. Take the knife

819
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,949
Don't forget my Kung-fu

820
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:18,690
You embarrass me

821
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:19,863
I wasted my efforts

822
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:20,827
Stop

823
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,030
A gun's enough

824
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,229
No need for Kung-fu

825
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,069
Why'd you come back?

826
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,311
I thought of some new moves

827
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:30,572
What moves?

828
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,206
None of your business

829
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:33,443
Let him go

830
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:36,718
Leave the gang

831
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,279
Now I'm the boss

832
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:39,653
Tell your people to get off

833
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:41,619
Fire then

834
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:43,624
I don't want your life

835
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:44,755
I need time

836
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,890
To catch the killer

837
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,392
I'll bring the card too

838
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:52,197
Good. Let me see

839
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,993
My best student at work

840
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,566
I'll give you 48 hours

841
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,273
Let them go

842
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:00,807
Practise your new moves

843
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,303
Coach. I promise

844
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:05,171
After learning it

845
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,510
I'll show you. Let's go

846
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:21,460
Thanks for coming to my rescue

847
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,632
I'm also helping myself

848
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,964
Let's separate

849
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:30,031
You're hurt. Want my support?

850
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:30,968
I'm alright

851
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,603
I'm afraid of losing face

852
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,568
Which of us go first?

853
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:36,910
Both, I hope

854
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,707
But I've only got 48 hours

855
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,276
Bye, then

856
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,085
Bye

857
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,391
Remember to teach me diving

858
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:12,715
Fei

859
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,809
Dragon's awake

860
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:16,714
No kidding?

861
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:17,885
Brother is back

862
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,179
Brother...

863
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:19,879
Where did you go last night?

864
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:20,648
You're late

865
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:21,756
Fei, you're hurt

866
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:22,357
and bleeding

867
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:23,424
Just a scratch

868
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:24,291
You alright?

869
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,053
How's Dragon first?

870
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:28,762
Good....you're with us

871
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,994
I had a dream. You were...

872
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,827
...all killed

873
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,163
You weren't dreaming

874
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:36,597
While rescuing you

875
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,240
We were shot

876
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,407
We got you here

877
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,208
Incredible that

878
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,776
We come to this

879
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,809
Is he really conscious?

880
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,108
Remember how we became Special Forces?

881
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:50,819
Ever see "Pao, the Judge"?

882
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,315
Watching "Superman"?

883
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,056
Remember my mum?

884
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:56,822
Just like me

885
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,791
Nanny, I'm not dumb

886
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,661
We're alive

887
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:03,199
Have to get the card

888
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:04,297
Where?

889
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,700
It was dangerous

890
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,298
The killer covered me

891
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:11,270
I put the card in a seat

892
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,743
Row H No. 53

893
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:15,270
In between the lining

894
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:16,669
Let's go

895
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:17,641
Hold on

896
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:18,743
I've got something to tell you

897
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:20,078
Coach's here

898
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,180
Coach?

899
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:22,141
His proteges?

900
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,445
I met them last night

901
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,548
You escaped unharmed?

902
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,283
I'm lucky

903
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:27,812
Is it the one in the hospital?

904
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:28,420
Who?

905
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:29,081
That's...

906
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:29,987
Keep it a secret

907
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,324
I'll tell you later

908
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:32,626
Go and get the card first

909
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:33,261
Nanny

910
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,260
I'll look after Dragon

911
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,360
Prepare for victory

912
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:38,763
Be ready in 1 0 minutes

913
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,027
OK OK

914
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:41,699
Colonel

915
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:44,701
Dragon is awake

916
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:45,964
They're going to get the card

917
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,501
Keep in touch

918
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,043
They're ready

919
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,077
Good work

920
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,925
Enjoy yourselves

921
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:06,458
Tsun

922
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,096
What is it?

923
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:08,629
I've something to say. Follow me

924
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:09,857
OK. You stay

925
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,765
The company's decided to let you go

926
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,536
A plane leaves
for the U.S. this afternoon

927
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:20,101
You're keeping me from making money

928
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,241
Ying'll take up your duties

929
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:23,442
She knows nothing

930
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:24,473
I'll tell her

931
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:25,912
Anything else?

932
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:26,843
You can go

933
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,779
Right, Sun

934
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:34,553
Go to hell

935
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:40,760
I'm boss now

936
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,307
He did it on purpose

937
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:03,744
Go after them

938
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,387
Got the card. Don't make a scene

939
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:06,882
No one can outdo Superman

940
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:07,819
I'll chase after him

941
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:11,187
Look after him

942
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,583
All by yourself?

943
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:36,514
You ain't qualified

944
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:37,243
Let me deal with him

945
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:38,052
You know...

946
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:39,688
we've been trapped?

947
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:12,080
This could be your grave,

948
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:12,949
satisfied?

949
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:13,656
I'd consider...

950
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,518
sending your corpse to U.S.

951
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:17,588
Your mum must an idiot

952
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,888
with such dumb kids

953
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:21,495
I forgot you're orphans

954
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:22,962
You mum must be illiterate Indian

955
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,733
You shouldn't say that!

956
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:29,332
You bet!

957
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:30,368
Just watch how

958
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,700
See how the Indian in war

959
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:06,903
The game is not over yet. Stay!

960
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:07,734
I won't let him go easily

961
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,969
Superman, don't chase

962
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,331
Watch out!

963
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,931
Run

964
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,512
Superman!

965
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:51,478
Superman!

966
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:55,617
Hang on

967
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:57,989
I will

968
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:58,990
Superman...

969
00:54:59,262 --> 00:54:59,694
How're you?

970
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:00,557
Pull him out

971
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:01,588
On my bike

972
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:20,110
Superman...wake up...

973
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,013
Wake...

974
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,445
Don't push me

975
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:28,115
You promised me the manager's post

976
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,019
OK

977
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:30,523
Tiny

978
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:31,752
I'm here

979
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,557
You promised a pretty secretary

980
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,892
I've already advertised

981
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:38,767
Superman

982
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:41,426
Monk, promise me...

983
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,400
I'll promise anything

984
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:45,065
Brother

985
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,003
What?

986
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:46,901
Finally I can...

987
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,076
...be the leader

988
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,241
But it's a difficult position

989
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,414
I promise, if I...

990
00:55:54,584 --> 00:56:02,013
...survive this, I'll follow your orders

991
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,250
Superman

992
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:05,792
Wake up!

993
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:08,430
Superman...

994
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:26,012
He's returning to his origins

995
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:33,786
Don't ask. Don't talk

996
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:37,256
We understand each other

997
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:40,555
Wrapped in the candlelight of the moment

998
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,790
Let's spend it quietly

999
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,967
Don't wave. Don't turn

1000
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:50,363
When I sing this song

1001
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:56,512
I'm afraid I'll weep

1002
00:56:57,347 --> 00:57:03,308
Hope my laughter will stay in your mind

1003
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:09,653
To share with you every season

1004
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,886
Grief and misery

1005
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:17,089
Life is full of sorrows

1006
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:23,502
It's after you've lossed that
you treasure

1007
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:26,865
Hard to make you stay

1008
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:30,206
But when we part

1009
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,474
Every memory will remain

1010
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:43,190
Hope my laugh will stay in your mind

1011
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:49,459
To share with you every season

1012
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:56,830
Farewell is coming

1013
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:03,543
Hope our reunion is near

1014
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:09,910
Chance may throw us together

1015
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:16,320
We'll meet again someday

1016
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:25,128
Tiny said you released the enemy

1017
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:26,298
I don't care what your relationship is

1018
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:29,061
We've got to avenge Superman's life

1019
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,164
I won't trouble others

1020
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,708
He called me Brother
I must do something

1021
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:54,887
How many do you need?

1022
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:55,758
Twenty is enough

1023
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:56,760
You got it

1024
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,132
Anything else?

1025
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,165
Let me introduce

1026
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,969
Colonel Yim

1027
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,774
Colonel's my best business partner

1028
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:06,976
My girl, Ying

1029
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:08,435
Nice to meet you

1030
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:09,441
Hi

1031
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:13,311
Our deal's almost done

1032
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,781
When Fei meets Colonel at the pier

1033
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,420
I'll kill him and get his card

1034
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:23,051
How about celebrating afterwards?

1035
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,285
Got to finish off his partners too

1036
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:27,824
Maybe a party at night

1037
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,488
What do you think?

1038
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,462
Does Sun know?

1039
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,466
I forgot to tell you,

1040
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:35,729
I've killed him

1041
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,035
Well done

1042
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:42,709
Your next move?

1043
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:46,743
It'll be our big day

1044
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,514
Congratulations! A perfect match

1045
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:53,388
I know

1046
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:55,547
Excuse me

1047
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,370
Miss Ying's coming towards the lobby

1048
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:10,268
Let her go

1049
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:11,540
Yes

1050
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:14,339
Miss...

1051
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,214
You can leave me once

1052
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,650
But you'll always be mine

1053
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:36,896
I want to see Fei

1054
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,024
Steelbar

1055
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:38,599
What do you want?

1056
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:39,792
Calm down

1057
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:40,367
Fire then

1058
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:40,831
Let's see what she's got to say

1059
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:41,936
I'm harmless

1060
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:43,231
Tell Fei

1061
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,840
If he met Colonel tomorrow,

1062
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,237
he'll need an extra life,

1063
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,671
or a coffin

1064
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:49,807
I want your life now

1065
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:51,710
Save yourselves first

1066
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,207
Even I know your hiding place

1067
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:54,680
You think you're safe?

1068
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,277
Whatever your relation with Fei is,

1069
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,283
I'm taking revenge for Superman

1070
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:00,021
If I wanted to kill you

1071
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,085
You wouldn't be speaking here

1072
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:04,090
You arguing with me

1073
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:17,236
Why help Fei?

1074
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:18,532
Who're you?

1075
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:20,007
I'm not his girl

1076
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:22,977
But why'd you help him that much?

1077
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,108
We were both betrayed for the card

1078
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:28,909
In helping him

1079
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:30,882
I also helped myself

1080
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,017
Understand?

1081
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:35,187
Go to Kau To Shan

1082
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,848
Maybe he's there

1083
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:54,305
How'd you find me?

1084
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,941
Ying told me

1085
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,077
Don't meet Yim tomorrow

1086
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:01,477
He's the spy

1087
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:02,709
I must go, for Superman's sake

1088
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,904
Where's our hiding place tonight?

1089
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,176
Where are they?

1090
01:02:32,715 --> 01:02:33,545
They're gone

1091
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,005
To where?

1092
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:37,518
I don't know
After I finished the call...

1093
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:40,787
Shit!

1094
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,644
Wah...

1095
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:05,405
Who?

1096
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,776
Come out

1097
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:10,280
What's up?

1098
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:13,887
Come

1099
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:14,784
Where can we hide?

1100
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:15,719
To the stable

1101
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:16,524
Over there?

1102
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:17,590
Follow me

1103
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,356
Be careful

1104
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:22,920
Take care...

1105
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:23,722
It's a roof over our heads

1106
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:24,594
Careful

1107
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:27,595
Cold?

1108
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:28,360
Yes

1109
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:29,534
Take the clothes

1110
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:31,334
You may catch a cold

1111
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:33,472
Hang on

1112
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:26,394
Colonel, you killed chief,

1113
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:27,221
injured Dragon for these diamonds

1114
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,190
Want me as a substitute?

1115
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:31,165
It's a serious offence

1116
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:33,125
I can sentence you to death

1117
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,901
Plenty of opportunities in this age

1118
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:39,367
We should all plan for future

1119
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:40,405
Even if we're honest

1120
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:44,102
You think
the money'll be returned unopened?

1121
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:45,970
You cops are crooks

1122
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:47,680
The officials are cheats

1123
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,845
With people like you, life is hard

1124
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,283
What about our lives as soldiers?

1125
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:54,851
You're always complaining the government

1126
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,522
What's your contribution to the country?

1127
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,227
Your life?

1128
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:02,158
I salute you

1129
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,259
You're bad

1130
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,398
Don't count us in

1131
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,003
Stop moving your head

1132
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:43,769
and hands

1133
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:44,599
And me

1134
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:57,618
Brother...

1135
01:05:58,754 --> 01:05:59,413
Why do you come?

1136
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,547
You haven't paid this month's instalment

1137
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:04,258
Buddies, relax

1138
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:05,394
You come here for money

1139
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:07,495
We can't lose you after Superman

1140
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:20,701
I'm still alive. Disappointed?

1141
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:22,235
Only a matter of time

1142
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:23,836
I'll visit tomorrow

1143
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:25,338
Plan on it

1144
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:28,909
Good. I'll prepare a death game

1145
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:30,646
With fabulous prizes

1146
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,179
Apart from the card

1147
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:34,545
Our lives

1148
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:35,649
Are you in?

1149
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:36,751
I'll come

1150
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,558
Good

1151
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,128
Don't be scared

1152
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:44,361
Climax's coming

1153
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:51,455
Miss, careful

1154
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:53,565
Take care

1155
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,000
You're a smooth talker

1156
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:58,868
but good-natured

1157
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:00,133
I don't mind you staying here

1158
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:01,573
If we stay longer,

1159
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:03,073
you may grow fond of me

1160
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:15,448
Mum

1161
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,816
Come over here

1162
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:19,992
It's cold

1163
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:20,787
Give me a kiss

1164
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:22,355
Let Pa carry you

1165
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:39,614
Monk, are you mad?

1166
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:41,476
Why're you holding a wooden fish?

1167
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,387
Let me show you

1168
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:47,515
Worship'll bring God's blessing

1169
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:49,919
Worship me then

1170
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,525
I'm the Gun God

1171
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:52,959
I'll come with you

1172
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:55,556
No. Wake us up tomorrow instead

1173
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:56,827
I can still shoot

1174
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,494
We know, but no

1175
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:00,826
You stay and open the shop

1176
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:03,064
Despite the number of us returning

1177
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,431
The shop must open

1178
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,932
I don't want to live here

1179
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:07,300
Here's without any possessions

1180
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:09,071
I promise

1181
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,403
Promise me too

1182
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,809
For the shop, come back on time

1183
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:13,911
Of course!

1184
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,175
Even if they don't, I'll

1185
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:17,811
Lucky to all

1186
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,111
Just kidding, sorry

1187
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:22,722
Don't forget

1188
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,989
The deadline's in 48 hours

1189
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:26,693
Coach'll come anytime

1190
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:28,189
We can't choose

1191
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:30,428
Try our best

1192
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:52,083
Ready

1193
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:56,087
Go

1194
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:36,193
You plan it?

1195
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:37,558
What do you think?

1196
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:38,931
You decide

1197
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,632
Are we smart today?

1198
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:48,970
Very. So I'm dressed up

1199
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:50,775
Go

1200
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,122
Good morning

1201
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,663
You look refreshed

1202
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,322
and prepared

1203
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:47,031
Don't be nervous

1204
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,768
I'm the host, welcome to all

1205
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:51,370
Ying

1206
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:53,834
You also interested in this game?

1207
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:56,534
The prizes must be attractive

1208
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:58,404
But I'm fair

1209
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:01,145
You got to obey the rules too

1210
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:04,384
There's still time to change your mind

1211
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:06,582
My ring's still yours

1212
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:07,517
Come over

1213
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:08,849
Your death is looming

1214
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:10,452
Leave the ring for your burial

1215
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:14,693
Is your show over?

1216
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:16,896
Brought the card?

1217
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,564
Can't you see?

1218
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:20,368
Prizes are on the 60th floors

1219
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:22,433
but whether you can get it...

1220
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:23,535
I want nothing

1221
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:25,134
but you, bastard

1222
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,008
Game starts

1223
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:33,342
Flying dragons

1224
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,197
Dual dragons

1225
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:55,894
Dormant dragon strikes

1226
01:12:58,741 --> 01:12:59,730
Marble spill

1227
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:07,213
Dragon phoenix dance

1228
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:17,182
Come over here

1229
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:31,803
The ground is cleared

1230
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,267
Let's split

1231
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:34,533
Where's security?

1232
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,040
1 0th floors

1233
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,093
We'll meet on the 30th floors

1234
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:58,661
If we come out alive

1235
01:13:59,134 --> 01:13:59,930
What's your plan?

1236
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:02,962
Back to U.S.

1237
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:05,097
You promised to teach me diving?

1238
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:08,272
February is too cold

1239
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,779
But I've heard by then

1240
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:14,573
The Great Wall's Scenery is much better

1241
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:15,842
I want you to take me

1242
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:30,088
Fei went in 1 0 minutes ago

1243
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:31,264
He's now advancing

1244
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:33,034
We've closed down nearby streets

1245
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:33,959
OK

1246
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:38,570
If I don't come out in 30 minutes,

1247
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,035
blast the building

1248
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:40,868
Yes, sir

1249
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:43,936
6 fools following me

1250
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:09,866
They's here

1251
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:16,339
Where?

1252
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:30,523
Dragon butt

1253
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:34,458
Two grenades for you

1254
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:38,963
Boss, security's bombed

1255
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,234
Coming to climax

1256
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:20,004
You continuing

1257
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:21,005
Yes

1258
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:35,015
Fei, say hello to your pal

1259
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,214
He won't submit

1260
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,693
You don't want to see Dragon?

1261
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:44,862
Set him free and the card's yours

1262
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:46,164
Sharp

1263
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:49,130
You'd demean yourself for a card

1264
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:50,931
You the killer in the coliseum?

1265
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,035
Am I a good shot?

1266
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:54,866
You're so damn proud?

1267
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:56,237
You've no right to criticize me

1268
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:58,211
He confessed. Over to you

1269
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:08,553
You can try

1270
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:14,853
Dragon

1271
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,573
You nearly fooled us

1272
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:31,610
I told you before

1273
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,111
It's you who see me as a handicap

1274
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,381
This makes 7 at us

1275
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:41,312
Fei, I've come

1276
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:45,655
Coach, you're late

1277
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:46,995
Don't worry

1278
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:49,786
We'll meet soon

1279
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:51,992
You take care

1280
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,095
I miss the others

1281
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,163
We'll hold a graduation dinner

1282
01:17:57,439 --> 01:17:58,167
Enjoy yourself

1283
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,374
To gain time, we'll stay

1284
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:01,304
You two catch Tsun

1285
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:02,507
OK?

1286
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:17,121
Well deserved

1287
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:20,819
Next party

1288
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:31,564
Fei, you're worse

1289
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,535
48th floors took you 20 minutes

1290
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:36,606
You failed this exam

1291
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,307
I respect old man only

1292
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,105
Which floor are you on?

1293
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:40,243
Want my help?

1294
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,183
I'm always on top of you

1295
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:57,058
Fei, what happen?

1296
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:58,096
He's taken to gondola by Coach

1297
01:18:58,266 --> 01:18:59,062
Hurry

1298
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:13,639
So at ease?

1299
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:22,185
Coach, get it?

1300
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:34,696
Take my hand

1301
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,335
Who's this bald-head?

1302
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:46,144
He's interrupting our game

1303
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:47,506
I can't join in, no fun

1304
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:51,017
Let me finish him off

1305
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:51,912
No

1306
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:52,914
Why?

1307
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:54,417
You don't want to play with me?

1308
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:56,654
Give me the card for safe keeping

1309
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,087
I'll be the judge for you two

1310
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:00,717
Don't think of escaping

1311
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:02,860
If I don't get out in 1 0 minutes

1312
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,224
They'll blast the building

1313
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:08,897
So I save much work?

1314
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:12,067
Thanks!
Bald-head, you're quite something

1315
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,571
Better than Fei

1316
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:16,270
I'm a little aversed to see you die

1317
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,738
Fei, give me the card

1318
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:21,082
Only I can order you

1319
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:21,975
You can't

1320
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:22,741
If you weren't so stupid

1321
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:23,680
You wouldn't be reduce to this

1322
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:25,452
Release me first

1323
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,518
I'll get out myself

1324
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:36,927
The prize is drawn

1325
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:38,030
Game's finished

1326
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,531
Prepare to die

1327
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:41,630
Wait! Another player

1328
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:43,467
Want to continue?

1329
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:44,704
Wonderful

1330
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,439
Wait!

1331
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,834
Continue by yourself?

1332
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:50,871
One more time

1333
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:54,442
All for this guy?

1334
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:56,345
I'll play anyway

1335
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,685
Hold tight

1336
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:01,818
Are you crazy?

1337
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:03,051
All for you

1338
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:05,789
Ying

1339
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:12,731
Give me your gun

1340
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:20,630
I'm falling

1341
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:21,332
Hold my leg

1342
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:22,441
Your shoes won't fall off?

1343
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:26,072
3 minutes before the blast, over

1344
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:26,942
Retreat

1345
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:28,013
Yes

1346
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:34,989
Fei, I've lost contact with them

1347
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:38,023
This building will blow up in 2 minutes

1348
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:39,987
Tell them to retreat

1349
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:42,322
Or it'll be too late

1350
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,497
Listen, all lifts have stopped

1351
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:45,189
Try to...

1352
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:47,198
get down in 2 minutes

1353
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:48,593
Give the walkie-talkie to bomb experts

1354
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:49,767
or we'll die

1355
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:50,730
But we're on 52th floors

1356
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,464
I'm on 58th floors

1357
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:53,602
See you

1358
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:54,966
Hurry

1359
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:56,634
Dragon, how's your leg?

1360
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:57,778
Fine. Hurry

1361
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:07,548
40th floors? Let's try our luck!

1362
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:12,550
I want to know something

1363
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:14,494
What did the girl teach you?

1364
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:16,362
I won't tell the others

1365
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:17,223
Really want to know?

1366
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:18,658
Tell me

1367
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,026
Teach you after I learn it

1368
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:25,432
Count down to explosion

1369
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:32,242
1 0, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

1370
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:36,382
4, 3, 2, 1 ...

1371
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:37,414
Wait

1372
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:41,580
Take it

1373
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:43,949
Coach has something to say

1374
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:46,483
Coach?

1375
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:49,695
Whoever you're, stop the blast

1376
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:51,666
Amen

1377
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:54,826
You should jump earlier

1378
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:55,970
I'm breathless!

1379
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:01,634
You're lucky

1380
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,541
to have escaped death

1381
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:04,937
Fight next time

1382
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,444
Take out the card

1383
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:09,309
Ask my gun first

1384
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:50,489
Fei

1385
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,538
Bye

1386
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:13,310
Blast this lift!

1387
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:24,916
Fei's in life no. 3. It's sinking

1388
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:26,724
Damn! How to save him?

1389
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:29,795
He dies this way?

1390
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:35,735
God'll come in

1391
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:39,702
Buddha's spirit

1392
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,474
A million Buddha

1393
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:03,324
How'll it be?

1394
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:50,174
Ying, give me your hands

1395
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:53,412
Hold tight

1396
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:02,990
Don't go...

1397
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,884
I'm cold. Don't leave me

1398
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:14,995
The cord's about to break

1399
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:17,562
Your hands...

1400
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,672
Save me in the end

1401
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:29,175
You don't want me to die

1402
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:34,948
Come over here

1403
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:48,361
Get away

1404
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:12,955
Coach, blow up the building?

1405
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:16,559
Shit! I'm the only one in here

1406
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:18,596
Send someone to help

1407
01:27:24,105 --> 01:27:25,094
Ying

1408
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,701
Our present to you

1409
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:31,136
No harm

1410
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:33,041
An invitation
to our restaurant's opening

1411
01:27:34,148 --> 01:27:36,082
Wait till the shop opens

1412
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:36,910
Are you going to change jobs?

1413
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,347
Why don't you join us?

1414
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,152
Too nice an offer

1415
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:42,412
Wait till...

1416
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,887
I settle my affairs in U.S.

1417
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:45,420
Bye

1418
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:49,421
Brother, we tried our best

1419
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:50,956
See her off

1420
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:53,926
Success depends, go

1421
01:27:54,202 --> 01:27:56,636
You all want me to go?

1422
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,235
Shamming?

1423
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:01,065
I'll see you off

1424
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,507
Giving me the card?

1425
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:05,043
What about your boss?

1426
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,372
Stay, if you can't leave me

1427
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:07,603
Which do you want, card or me?

1428
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:08,610
Both

1429
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:09,609
Greedy pig!

1430
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:27,263
Card? She wants me

1431
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:28,364
If works!
