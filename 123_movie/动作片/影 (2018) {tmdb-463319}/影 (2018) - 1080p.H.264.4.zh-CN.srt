Why do you jump in if you can't swim?
- I can.

3

Fond of sunbathing, eh?

4
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,875
Did you swallow water?
That's out of fear.

5

It's alright.
Fear can sometimes be useful. Hold on.

00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,541
What is your current occupation?

169
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,750
I'm a mechanic...

170
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:38,458
...at <i>Luftwaffe </i>warehouses.
- No, seriously!

171
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:42,458
What is your current occupation?

172
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:49,416
I don't understand.

173
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:54,541
Well, let's take your daughter...

174
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:59,458
She is with the communists now,
fighting against us.

175
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:03,208
My daughter...

176
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,166
I haven't seen her for ages.

177
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:15,458
I don't know her anymore.

178
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:24,208
It's not very original.

179
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:35,666
What about your family?

180
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:41,541
What would happen to them?

181
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,291
Herr Lipke.

182
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:56,625
There's no use in keeping silent.

183
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:03,000
I've told you.

184
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:07,458
There's nothing I can tell you.

185
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:12,416
It will weigh on your conscience.

186
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:15,833
If not now then later.

187
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:18,208
Perhaps you are helping the Jews?

188
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,041
The Jews?

189
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:25,041
I don't know any Jews.

190
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:27,500
And I don't want to know any.

191
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,333
Fine.

192
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,666
However, in the long run
it's no use keeping silent.

193
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:40,041
You will be all alone.
It's really not worth it.

194
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:44,333
It all ends with death.

195
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:53,833
There will be no communists
and no Jews any more.

196
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:05,291
<i>Rest assured.</i>

197
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:10,833
<i>We are going to keep
an eye on you, Lipke.</i>

198
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:10,666
<i>Gauleiter Lauterbacher is talking
</i>about the importance of your mission.

199
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:14,791
<i>Men from all walks of life -</i>

200
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:18,083
<i>workers, peasants, civil servants...</i>

201
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,500
Here.

202
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,041
<i>...all are taking part...</i>

203
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:23,083
Put it down here.

204
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,125
Here.

205
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,500
Fricis!

206
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:50,125
Are you taking in
some more people tomorrow?

207
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,250
I don't know yet. Damn!

208
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:32,000
<i>Nine...</i>

209
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,541
<i>Eleven...</i>

210
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:40,916
<i>Thirteen...</i>

211
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,125
<i>Seventeen...</i>

212
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,333
Halt!

213
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,166
<i>Go on! Eighteen...</i>

214
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,375
<i>Twenty and twenty-one.</i>

215
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:14,250
<i>The whole group has
returned to the Ghetto.</i>

216
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:58,083
Arke! Now we can get
more people out of the Ghetto.

217
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,541
This changing of clothes
is no good any more.

218
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,416
We can get caught at any moment.

219
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:05,541
If the number of people doesn't match,
we're all dead.

220
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,750
You too have to come out.

221
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:10,333
Žanis, you said yourself…
- That was then.

222
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:12,583
Now it's different.

223
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:16,041
You won't manage without me
on this side.

224
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,541
We have to get out
at least your wife and Mina.

225
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:22,916
They won't leave without me.
We have to stay.

226
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:26,041
Just don't stay too long.
Alright...

227
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:31,291
Here's the list of people. - Okay

228
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:59,875
<i>Anyone trying to climb over the fence
</i>or contact the residents of the Ghetto

229
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:03,000
<i>will be shot without warning</i>

230
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,833
What are you doing
so late in the Ghetto?

231
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:16,083
We brought a Jewish work crew.

232
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:21,375
And it took too long.
- So you say.

233
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:26,083
I mean, it took too long.
- Yes. So you say.

234
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:29,000
Everything is in order.
- Thank you.

235
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:31,791
Good night.
- Good night.

236
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:19,375
<i>Madness! He betrayed us like that!</i>

237
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,666
<i>You have no idea... That shit...</i>

238
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:23,916
<i>You have no idea...</i>

239
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,791
<i>Why didn't they take me away?
</i>I don't understand!

240
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,916
<i>Stop it!
</i>- That asshole betrayed us!

241
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,333
<i>A couple of days...</i>

242
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,208
<i>Asshole!</i>

243
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,125
<i>When the Germans came,
</i>I allowed him to stay at the cinema...

244
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:43,041
<i>Stop raging...
</i>- How could I not rage?

245
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:47,375
<i>How could I not?
</i>It's absolute madness!

246
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,416
<i>Wait!</i>

247
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,500
So you like blood, do you?

248
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:38,958
I told you. If you spill the beans...

249
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:34,125
We'll hide people in our house.

250
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:41,666
Are you out of your mind?

251
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:47,833
No, we can't do it!

252
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:54,541
You may not care what happens to you,
but think about the boys.

253
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,875
We have to take the risk.

254
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,791
There's no choice.

255
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,833
I am not picking up
dead bodies any more.

256
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:12,000
Žanis. Please!

257
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:17,625
We must.

258
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:22,208
We won't hide them inside the house.

259
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,375
In the pit.

260
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:30,291
You have to trust me.

261
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,833
<i>Halt!</i>

262
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:54,291
<i>Halt, you Jewish shit!
</i>Stay where you are!

263
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:58,916
<i>Stay where you are!
</i>I'll shoot!

264
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,958
Aren't you afraid of dying?

265
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,041
What?

266
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,125
No.

267
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,083
Thats not wise

268
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,375
One must fear death.

269
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,541
so as not to succumb to it too easily

270
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,666
All right, Zigis. Look.

271
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:51,125
If you see a stranger
walking behind the fence...

272
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:54,541
press the switch.

273
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,750
Let's go.

274
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:45,500
Well, Zigis. Come down to us.

275
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,625
Come on.

276
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:53,416
You have never visited us.

277
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:59,166
Come on.

278
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,875
Be careful.

279
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,500
Keep silent.

280
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,416
Careful, careful.

281
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,458
Go on, go on.

282
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:23,625
Feet first.

283
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,041
That's it.

284
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:41,250
Clear off! Clear off!

285
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,291
They're coming! The guards!

286
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:05,041
One more! Quick!

287
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,791
One more!

288
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,625
That’s it. Go!

289
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:41,958
I'll go.

290
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,041
No, you won't.

291
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:52,416
That's the right decision.

292
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:03,416
If Fredis does not join the German Army,
they'll be here in no time.

293
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,250
We'll hide him. They won't find him.

294
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,625
Really?

295
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:23,333
Maybe they won't find Fredis.
But how about the bunker?

296
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,041
Fine.

297
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:34,625
Who are we going to send away next?

298
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:37,208
No need to dramatize.

299
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:43,000
Mum, really! Don't!

300
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,500
Zigis!

301
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:14,541
Zigis!

302
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:44,125
Zigis?

303
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:49,041
Come with me.

304
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:28,833
Go back in, quick!

305
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:31,916
Go in! Quick!
- We came out for a moment...

306
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:34,541
Go in, quick!
- We came out for a moment...

307
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:53,666
Mummy!

308
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,625
Your brother...

309
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:09,708
He's gone.

310
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:42,500
From now on you should stay
in the bunker.

311
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:44,541
You must not come out.

312
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:47,583
Žanis. What are we going to do?

313
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:51,208
I'll think of something.

314
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,458
All right?

315
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:17,833
He does not have a plan
what to do with us.

316
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:24,541
It's pointless sitting here.

317
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,000
We have to do something.

318
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:30,958
<i>All the able-bodied males
</i>in the territory of the Ghetto

319
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,625
<i>must report for transfer.</i>

320
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:38,041
<i>Any refusal to comply with the order
</i>will be punished.

321
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,708
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

322
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:44,291
<i>All the able-bodied males
</i>in the territory of the Ghetto

323
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:47,791
<i>must report for transfer.</i>

324
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:51,208
<i>Any refusal to comply with the order
</i>will be punished.

325
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,708
<i>Attention! Attention...</i>

326
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:16,333
Daddy! Daddy!

327
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:22,333
Don't go anywhere!

328
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,291
Out! Out!

329
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,958
There are some people there.

330
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,375
Out, out! Quick!

331
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:43,791
Out!

332
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,416
What happened down there?

333
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:21,458
Were you entertaining yourselves?

334
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:26,250
This one ate up everything.
That one got mad.

335
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:28,958
You understand.
- No, I don't.

336
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,333
We have enough food.

337
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:33,416
No, we don't.

338
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:37,041
We have to ration.

339
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:39,250
People will freeze to death.

340
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:45,375
You’ll have to somehow
weather the night.

341
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:48,375
You and you. Come with me.

342
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:57,166
Your mother is a very good person.

343
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:28,208
We can go.

344
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:40,875
<i>Get down.</i>

345
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,875
<i>Careful.</i>

346
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:58,166
There is no more space here.
- Stop it! Be quiet.

347
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:02,166
Then think of something!
- Hush!

348
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:08,458
We would be lost without him.

349
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:37,583
...Then he went to the pub

350
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:40,708
and saw that girl, Lola.

351
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:46,083
Her hips and her boobs...

352
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:49,083
And the professor forgot
about his students.

353
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:53,291
All he could think about was that beauty.

354
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:59,166
The film was set in a
small German town...

355
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,958
I can't...

356
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,541
I can't stand it anymore.
What are you blabbing about?

357
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:08,166
I can't stand it anymore!
What are you blabbing about?!

358
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:16,291
Let me out! Let me out!

359
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:27,875
Let me out!

360
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:30,708
Calm down!
- Let me out!

361
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:39,541
Calm down!

362
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:49,083
Let me...

363
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:05,708
You must not go there!
You have nothing to do there!

364
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:15,083
Soon they will be gone.

365
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,541
And then you’ll miss them.

366
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:36,583
Go and play with the dog.

367
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:08,875
It's pointless.

368
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:10,750
It's pointless.

369
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:13,500
All right. Who wants to come with me?

370
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:20,375
All right. The ones who'll go...

371
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:24,416
Nathan...

372
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:31,208
Avi...

373
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:09,166
Your papers.

374
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:23,125
Civilians are forbidden
to leave the city for now.

375
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:26,583
What are you carrying?
- Nothing special.

376
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:30,666
Old rubbish that may come in handy.

377
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:39,125
And underneath?

378
01:01:39,166 --> 01:01:42,333
Just a couple of Russians.

379
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,125
Go back.

380
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:50,333
I can't let you pass.

381
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:54,541
Here's your papers. - Yeah, thanks.

382
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:57,041
Shit...

383
01:01:57,916 --> 01:02:01,291
Get lost! Quick!

384
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:06,208
Get lost!

385
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,333
Hey, do you have a smoke?

386
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:02,500
Hey...

387
01:04:11,291 --> 01:04:15,250
Arke, are you there?
Send out the next ones.

388
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:17,500
Žanis, there won't be any.

389
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:20,333
They won't come.
They're afraid.

390
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:23,083
I can't persuade anyone.

391
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,125
It's no joke!
Something's not all right.

392
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:27,416
Don't just stand here. Go away!

393
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:29,416
You and your family must leave.

394
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:31,541
Yes. Soon.

395
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:33,500
Damn!

396
01:04:44,958 --> 01:04:46,833
Fucking Russians!

397
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:55,791
Just don't talk about guilt.

398
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:16,625
You have changed.

399
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,791
You're like a child.

400
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:33,166
We have become strangers.

401
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:42,333
It's not true.

402
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:49,416
It is.

403
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:24,416
<i>Quick!</i>

404
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:36,958
<i>All the able-bodied males
</i>in the territory of the Ghetto...

405
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,958
They were taken away.

406
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:50,500
No more...

407
01:07:52,916 --> 01:07:54,958
This very morning...

408
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:58,458
my little girl...

409
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,708
We have to go. We have to go.

410
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:07,833
Almost all were taken away.

411
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:10,541
They didn’t let me go with them.

412
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:14,041
Arke, you can do nothing about it.

413
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,041
I have nowhere to go.

414
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:31,041
I can't, Žanis...

415
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,250
Žanis must leave the Ghetto
immediately. The guards are coming!

416
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:38,375
Arke...

417
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:41,541
Just go!

418
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:03,333
<i>Faster!</i>

419
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:09,916
<i>Faster</i>

420
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:15,708
Faster!

421
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:21,500
<i>Move!</i>

422
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,791
Faster!

423
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:34,583
<i>I can't stand it!</i>

424
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:43,500
<i>What are you doing? Are you mad?</i>

425
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:15,000
<i>Go on! Go on!</i>

426
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:10,083
<i>Move on!</i>

427
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:12,000
<i>Not so slow!</i>

428
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,625
<i>Go on, go on.</i>

429
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:23,333
<i>I said, move!</i>

430
01:16:17,916 --> 01:16:21,958
Soon there won't be anyone left there.

431
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,208
We have to...

432
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:27,916
We have to get out more people
as soon as possible.

433
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:34,708
There was...

434
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:38,416
There was a crowd.

435
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:42,875
You cannot save everyone.

436
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:48,333
But there should be more….

437
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,458
More should be saved.
More...

438
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,541
You're risking your neck.

439
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:00,291
They'll come.

440
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,791
Sooner or later.

441
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:06,875
Sharya here used to know
someone at the port.

442
01:17:06,916 --> 01:17:09,833
He said he could take some people out.

443
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:14,666
I'll take them to the port.
Then we'll see.

444
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:31,000
Thank you.

445
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,250
Quiet now!

446
01:19:57,791 --> 01:19:59,500
Lipke?

447
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:01,041
Yes?

448
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:18,541
Are these your papers?
- Yes.

449
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:22,375
They were in the pocket of my coat.

450
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:27,125
The coat was stolen from me

451
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:30,500
a couple of days ago.

452
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:34,791
I was really freezing.
- Cut the crap!

453
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,041
What about these Jews here?

454
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:40,666
Do you know them?

455
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:43,875
Did they rob you?

456
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:51,041
No.

457
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,333
I don't know. And these robbers...

458
01:20:55,958 --> 01:20:57,750
I don't know them either.

459
01:20:58,041 --> 01:21:01,416
They say all kinds of people
are showing up here.

460
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:05,375
You meter is running really fast.

461
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:19,458
Turn off the heater, quick!

462
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:29,416
If it turns out that you've sheltered them,
you'll be guilty not only of...

463
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:31,458
My house is...

464
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,541
no shelter for any Jews.

465
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:49,833
Tell me, boy, do you know these men?
- No.

466
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:57,458
You can tell me,
nothing will happen to your father.

467
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,875
You know these men, don't you?
- No.

468
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,708
Hands off!

469
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:42,458
<i>Go there.</i>

470
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:46,041
That's it. Stop the search.

471
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,583
He won't be a nuisance any more.

472
01:22:49,875 --> 01:22:52,041
There's nothing.

473
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:42,583
We are lucky.

474
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:54,666
Damn!
