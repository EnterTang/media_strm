1
0:01:51.62 --> 0:01:54.75
Please buy a present for your wife.

2
0:02:03.55 --> 0:02:06.68
They may not look good but they smell wonderful. Buy my flowers.

3
0:02:18.19 --> 0:02:22.24
Lovely day

4
0:02:22.32 --> 0:02:25.45
One should have flowers on a day like this. Buy some flowers

5
0:02:26.45 --> 0:02:29.70
lt's a bargain. Please

6
0:02:29.79 --> 0:02:32.37
- A present for your girlfriend!  - l don't have one.

7
0:02:32.46 --> 0:02:38.25
Well

8
0:02:40.80 --> 0:02:42.76
Maybe later

9
0:02:44.26 --> 0:02:46.01
l'm here if you change your mind!

10
0:02:48.64 --> 0:02:53.77
- Kaluga

11
0:02:53.85 --> 0:02:56.19
Another one's coming. Looks like our man.

12
0:03:54.16 --> 0:03:55.62
Herman

13
0:03:57.00 --> 0:03:59.08
Let's go. Kley

14
0:04:11.56 --> 0:04:16.60
Hey

15
0:04:16.69 --> 0:04:20.10
l haven't got a girl. Give 'em to Mihailich. He's in a bad mood today.

16
0:04:20.19 --> 0:04:24.48
Never mind Mihailich. You'll have a girlfriend soon.

17
0:04:24.57 --> 0:04:27.78
- Did you forget?  - What?

18
0:04:27.86 --> 0:04:30.78
You need to train your memory instead of chasing crooks.

19
0:04:30.87 --> 0:04:33.58
Tomorrow

20
0:04:35.08 --> 0:04:38.87
lmagine that Mihailich

21
0:04:38.96 --> 0:04:42.04
Andrey

22
0:04:42.13 --> 0:04:43.75
Be ready. Tomorrow you...

23
0:04:43.84 --> 0:04:45.17
Sod off!

24
0:04:45.26 --> 0:04:47.97
What a madhouse!

25
0:04:51.55 --> 0:04:54.14
My stomach still hurts.

26
0:05:03.27 --> 0:05:08.28
- Kaluga

27
0:05:08.36 --> 0:05:09.86
They are bringing up the car.

28
0:05:11.53 --> 0:05:15.24
Need some flowers? Fresh! From the countryside!

29
0:05:15.33 --> 0:05:16.58
Stand by

30
0:05:18.71 --> 0:05:20.92
Look at these flowers! So white!

31
0:05:24.46 --> 0:05:27.09
What's happening there?

32
0:05:28.63 --> 0:05:30.67
Where the devil did they come from?

33
0:05:32.01 --> 0:05:34.22
What's the traffic police doing here?

34
0:05:34.30 --> 0:05:40.02
Lots of people drive the wrong way down one-way streets to dodge the jams.

35
0:05:40.10 --> 0:05:41.48
Don't worry

36
0:05:41.56 --> 0:05:44.86
Unlike us

37
0:05:44.94 --> 0:05:47.15
They'll just grab their money and leave.

38
0:05:52.70 --> 0:05:56.24
Senior lieutenant Zhelyaznikov. Central district traffic police.

39
0:05:58.16 --> 0:05:59.25
Hi.

40
0:06:00.41 --> 0:06:03.46
Why have you parked here? Not enough space?

41
0:06:03.54 --> 0:06:06.25
Sorry officer. Just stopped for a moment.

42
0:06:06.92 --> 0:06:10.09
We needed to load something. We've got a heavy bag.

43
0:06:11.42 --> 0:06:12.63
l'm already on my way.

44
0:06:13.39 --> 0:06:17.10
What's the bag got to do with anything? This is a one-way street.

45
0:06:17.18 --> 0:06:21.35
That sign doesn't apply to you? You reversed halfway down the lane.

46
0:06:33.57 --> 0:06:35.41
So

47
0:06:36.45 --> 0:06:38.58
Kaluga

48
0:06:39.45 --> 0:06:43.79
We have a problem. A couple of plods are holding up our guys.

49
0:06:43.87 --> 0:06:47.33
Get rid of them! Odessa

50
0:06:47.96 --> 0:06:52.38
Listen

51
0:06:52.47 --> 0:06:56.30
Did you hear that? Didn't see it... So what are we going to do now?

52
0:06:57.22 --> 0:06:59.14
l don't like them.

53
0:06:59.22 --> 0:07:02.43
- Maybe we can sort this out here and now?  - l don't like them.

54
0:07:03.06 --> 0:07:07.77
You don't have to like us. But check my driver's permit.

55
0:07:09.11 --> 0:07:10.82
Perhaps you'll like that.

56
0:07:15.91 --> 0:07:18.45
A verbal warning

57
0:07:19.33 --> 0:07:21.54
All OK

58
0:07:30.00 --> 0:07:31.21
Well

59
0:07:32.30 --> 0:07:33.80
What's in your bag?

60
0:07:35.18 --> 0:07:37.51
Get out and open the bag for inspection.

61
0:07:47.77 --> 0:07:50.81
Come in

62
0:08:07.33 --> 0:08:11.84
Send backup and paramedics. Urgently! Can't you hear me? Now!

63
0:08:24.18 --> 0:08:26.18
Let's go!

64
0:10:23.30 --> 0:10:25.30
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

65
0:10:41.53 --> 0:10:43.20
Cover me!

66
0:11:02.92 --> 0:11:05.01
lnto the car! Quickly!

67
0:11:33.71 --> 0:11:35.79
Kon! Do it!

68
0:11:38.50 --> 0:11:41.13
Grenade! Down!

69
0:12:03.53 --> 0:12:05.69
They're leaving!

70
0:12:18.96 --> 0:12:20.67
Don't scream!

71
0:13:05.96 --> 0:13:10.13
Watch your driving

72
0:13:29.65 --> 0:13:32.86
- Guys

73
0:13:51.55 --> 0:13:54.47
- Aksinya

74
0:13:54.55 --> 0:13:58.27
- Whose fault is this accident?  - Please

75
0:14:00.77 --> 0:14:02.69
She's probably bought her driving licence.

76
0:14:17.79 --> 0:14:20.20
Daddy

77
0:14:20.87 --> 0:14:22.91
Nice car. Could be an automatic.

78
0:14:23.96 --> 0:14:27.59
But what guy? lt's that lady's car.

79
0:15:04.79 --> 0:15:05.87
Get out!

80
0:15:34.90 --> 0:15:36.11
Herman

81
0:15:40.79 --> 0:15:43.08
lnto the ambulance!

82
0:16:04.10 --> 0:16:05.39
Orda

83
0:16:22.20 --> 0:16:23.62
Let's go!

84
0:16:39.01 --> 0:16:40.43
Where did the medics get to?

85
0:16:45.60 --> 0:16:47.56
God...

86
0:16:48.06 --> 0:16:49.90
He could have killed me.

87
0:16:51.52 --> 0:16:53.94
He aimed right at my face.

88
0:16:55.57 --> 0:16:57.15
l want to live!

89
0:16:59.24 --> 0:17:01.82
l have a family.

90
0:17:01.82 --> 0:17:05.66
Don't

91
0:17:05.75 --> 0:17:10.75
This morning

92
0:17:10.83 --> 0:17:13.75
"Breaking News" reporters filming a traffic accident

93
0:17:13.84 --> 0:17:16.59
involving the popular singer Aksinya witnessed a gunfight...

94
0:17:16.67 --> 0:17:18.63
General Boldyrev speaking.

95
0:17:18.72 --> 0:17:23.05
Call all department heads and Special Services commanders.

96
0:17:23.14 --> 0:17:26.26
Meeting in my office. Right away.

97
0:17:26.85 --> 0:17:28.98
This shootout put innocent citizens at risk

98
0:17:29.06 --> 0:17:32.60
and the gangsters managed to escape

99
0:17:32.69 --> 0:17:39.19
Now to an eyewitness report on these incredible events from pop singer Aksinya.

100
0:17:39.28 --> 0:17:45.49
ln this street crowded with cars and people

101
0:17:45.58 --> 0:17:49.50
The shooting that followed put people's lives at risk

102
0:17:49.58 --> 0:17:51.87
including famous pop star Aksinya.

103
0:17:51.87 --> 0:17:53.79
Please tell us

104
0:17:53.88 --> 0:17:58.13
Honestly

105
0:17:58.13 --> 0:18:02.47
They were running all over the place

106
0:18:02.55 --> 0:18:05.93
And then the grenades! Just like in a real war.

107
0:18:06.01 --> 0:18:10.31
And now some unique footage from our cameramen at the scene.

108
0:18:10.81 --> 0:18:14.86
Both innocent bystanders and police died as a result of this firefight.

109
0:18:14.94 --> 0:18:18.98
According to police

110
0:18:19.07 --> 0:18:21.74
Not to compromise the investigation

111
0:18:21.82 --> 0:18:28.37
Simply unbelievable! A cop crying on TV. That's a first.

112
0:18:28.37 --> 0:18:30.58
You know

113
0:18:30.66 --> 0:18:33.71
My key objective is to soften the image of the police.

114
0:18:34.71 --> 0:18:37.04
No one will believe that they are heroes anyway.

115
0:18:37.13 --> 0:18:41.17
So why not show them as

116
0:18:41.26 --> 0:18:44.22
And a scandal is always good for any media campaign.

117
0:18:44.30 --> 0:18:46.97
OK

118
0:18:47.56 --> 0:18:50.97
l wish they'd give me a flashing light so l could sail through the traffic jams.

119
0:18:51.06 --> 0:18:54.69
Miss! Check

120
0:19:09.87 --> 0:19:13.00
- l didn't get it!  - Don't worry. lt'll be OK.

121
0:19:15.63 --> 0:19:18.84
l'm at work

122
0:19:23.34 --> 0:19:26.93
...this means that nobody is in control of the situation in our city.

123
0:19:27.55 --> 0:19:30.10
lf even policemen fear to walk the streets

124
0:19:30.18 --> 0:19:32.72
what about ordinary people like you and me?

125
0:19:32.81 --> 0:19:35.19
We are forced to face an unpleasant fact.

126
0:19:36.48 --> 0:19:41.44
The Moscow police is unable to remedy the current situation.

127
0:19:41.53 --> 0:19:48.24
The forces of law and order are thoroughly corrupt

128
0:19:48.32 --> 0:19:53.50
lf this corrupt

129
0:19:53.58 --> 0:19:55.41
cannot protect our citizens

130
0:19:55.50 --> 0:20:00.34
then let it not stop us from protecting ourselves.

131
0:20:00.42 --> 0:20:03.76
l have always pushed for the free sale of small arms

132
0:20:03.84 --> 0:20:05.84
and now the time has come.

133
0:20:07.97 --> 0:20:11.35
Enough? Or need we see more?

134
0:20:13.85 --> 0:20:15.56
What can we say to that?

135
0:20:20.90 --> 0:20:25.11
We launched plan 'lnterception' while the trail was still warm.

136
0:20:26.32 --> 0:20:29.95
Unfortunately it didn't bring swift results

137
0:20:30.03 --> 0:20:33.16
so plan 'Hurricane' has been initiated.

138
0:20:33.24 --> 0:20:38.21
The entire force has been put on full alert.

139
0:20:38.29 --> 0:20:41.71
We've just received the first reports.

140
0:20:41.79 --> 0:20:48.76
Eleven cars reported stolen have been recovered.

141
0:20:48.84 --> 0:20:53.26
Nine wanted persons were apprehended.

142
0:20:53.93 --> 0:21:00.31
Seven firearms and twelve knives have been seized

143
0:21:00.40 --> 0:21:03.86
as well as two kilograms of narcotic substances...

144
0:21:03.94 --> 0:21:05.40
What?

145
0:21:05.48 --> 0:21:07.19
What are you saying?

146
0:21:08.74 --> 0:21:12.07
Two kilograms of narcotic substances...

147
0:21:12.07 --> 0:21:14.24
Don't you understand what's going on?

148
0:21:14.33 --> 0:21:16.87
Grenades exploding in the streets!

149
0:21:18.87 --> 0:21:22.46
And not just anywhere

150
0:21:24.00 --> 0:21:28.97
All day the TV news has been showing a Moscow police sergeant crying at gunpoint.

151
0:21:32.55 --> 0:21:35.72
The President's office has already called me twice.

152
0:21:36.52 --> 0:21:39.77
And what do we have to show them? Seven knives?

153
0:21:39.85 --> 0:21:41.44
Twelve.

154
0:21:42.10 --> 0:21:47.57
Twelve knives and seven firearms.

155
0:21:47.65 --> 0:21:51.57
Don't you see that these bastards declared war on us?

156
0:21:54.28 --> 0:21:57.95
And we've got to respond not someday

157
0:22:03.08 --> 0:22:08.96
Sergei Petrovitch

158
0:22:10.09 --> 0:22:11.93
We have to wait until they give results.

159
0:22:12.01 --> 0:22:15.47
Are we living in Japan?

160
0:22:17.14 --> 0:22:21.27
Their clear-up rate for armed robberies is 76%.

161
0:22:21.35 --> 0:22:24.02
And what is it here? Should l remind you?

162
0:22:24.11 --> 0:22:27.65
Your standard measures usually have little effect.

163
0:22:30.28 --> 0:22:31.78
ln a war they're useless.

164
0:22:32.36 --> 0:22:34.86
No need to be dramatic. What war?

165
0:22:35.62 --> 0:22:37.91
They're not terrorists. They're common criminals.

166
0:22:37.99 --> 0:22:44.33
Really? Anything else of interest you can tell us about them

167
0:22:44.42 --> 0:22:45.58
Sadly

168
0:22:46.34 --> 0:22:48.00
We have reason to believe this gang

169
0:22:48.09 --> 0:22:51.59
is responsible for a number of armed robberies of bank security cars

170
0:22:51.67 --> 0:22:54.18
in different regions of the country.

171
0:22:54.26 --> 0:22:57.18
They appear infrequently

172
0:22:57.26 --> 0:23:00.93
All their raids are planned in great detail and executed impeccably.

173
0:23:01.02 --> 0:23:03.23
So far they have made no mistakes.

174
0:23:03.31 --> 0:23:05.48
Smirnov has been after them for two years

175
0:23:05.56 --> 0:23:07.86
but so far has been unable to run them to ground.

176
0:23:07.94 --> 0:23:12.90
Yesterday we received information about a possible hideout used by this gang.

177
0:23:12.99 --> 0:23:14.65
The rest you are all aware of it by now.

178
0:23:14.74 --> 0:23:17.62
Sooner or later they'll screw up and we'll get them.

179
0:23:18.49 --> 0:23:21.95
And all this media hue and cry will gradually run its course.

180
0:23:22.62 --> 0:23:24.12
lt's happened so many times before.

181
0:23:26.83 --> 0:23:31.80
OK. l see. Any other suggestions?

182
0:23:35.01 --> 0:23:41.22
Let's listen to our PR Director. Media witch-hunts are right up her street.

183
0:23:41.31 --> 0:23:44.31
Captain Verbitskaya

184
0:23:45.06 --> 0:23:48.65
l agree with Sergei Petrovitch. They've declared war on us.

185
0:23:49.94 --> 0:23:54.90
So

186
0:23:54.99 --> 0:24:00.78
won't be enough to lessen the impact of this PR disaster.

187
0:24:00.87 --> 0:24:04.12
We must beat them on the same battlefield

188
0:24:04.91 --> 0:24:07.12
within the virtual hyperspace of mass communications.

189
0:24:07.71 --> 0:24:09.21
What space?

190
0:24:09.29 --> 0:24:14.01
We need to turn the capture of this dangerous gang into a reality show.

191
0:24:15.59 --> 0:24:17.38
A reality show!

192
0:24:17.47 --> 0:24:20.80
One that demonstrates the courage and professional skills of the Moscow police

193
0:24:20.89 --> 0:24:24.85
as well as the openness and humanity of the law enforcement authorities.

194
0:24:26.10 --> 0:24:31.44
This show will be a world first.

195
0:24:31.52 --> 0:24:38.45
lmagine

196
0:24:38.53 --> 0:24:43.08
and the internet

197
0:24:43.16 --> 0:24:47.37
Our defeat today must be turned into a triumph!

198
0:24:55.67 --> 0:24:57.72
This is an interesting idea.

199
0:24:58.76 --> 0:25:01.47
But to make it work we have to find them first.

200
0:25:01.55 --> 0:25:03.14
Exactly.

201
0:25:03.72 --> 0:25:06.02
You find them for me

202
0:25:07.85 --> 0:25:10.19
and l'll take care of everything else.

203
0:25:11.27 --> 0:25:14.48
- Sergei Petrovitch

204
0:25:16.86 --> 0:25:18.90
ls the press release ready?

205
0:25:20.24 --> 0:25:23.16
Just finishing it. l'll bring it for approval in half an hour.

206
0:25:26.62 --> 0:25:28.83
Sergei Petrovitch

207
0:25:28.91 --> 0:25:31.62
thank you for your support.

208
0:25:31.71 --> 0:25:33.25
Katya.

209
0:25:34.34 --> 0:25:36.92
You do understand what's happening?

210
0:25:37.80 --> 0:25:41.38
All these TV reports

211
0:25:42.09 --> 0:25:44.97
Some silly sergeant raised his hands.

212
0:25:45.85 --> 0:25:48.18
My God

213
0:25:49.18 --> 0:25:50.64
That's just an excuse.

214
0:25:50.73 --> 0:25:52.52
You think l don't have enemies up there?

215
0:25:54.02 --> 0:25:56.44
lt's all just politics!

216
0:25:59.28 --> 0:26:02.11
lf you knew how much l miss your father now.

217
0:26:03.24 --> 0:26:04.70
What a clever guy he was!

218
0:26:04.78 --> 0:26:05.99
l hope you take after him.

219
0:26:06.08 --> 0:26:09.45
Sir

220
0:26:10.41 --> 0:26:11.71
Fine

221
0:26:11.79 --> 0:26:15.04
What you're suggesting has never been done before.

222
0:26:17.17 --> 0:26:20.55
But in the current situation it might be the only right solution.

223
0:26:20.63 --> 0:26:22.22
lt's all or nothing.

224
0:26:23.39 --> 0:26:26.43
l've already made all the necessary arrangements.

225
0:26:26.51 --> 0:26:32.60
You'll have wide powers and resources

226
0:26:33.65 --> 0:26:37.40
But you mustn't let me down.

227
0:26:39.69 --> 0:26:42.65
You understand what the consequences would be?

228
0:26:42.74 --> 0:26:47.62
Sir

229
0:26:48.54 --> 0:26:50.04
l won't let you down.

230
0:26:59.30 --> 0:27:01.59
Hamlet

231
0:27:04.30 --> 0:27:07.43
Hot dogs again! Sanya

232
0:27:13.69 --> 0:27:14.77
Thanks.

233
0:27:15.48 --> 0:27:18.06
Actually

234
0:27:23.70 --> 0:27:26.07
What are you looking at? Enjoying the view?

235
0:27:26.16 --> 0:27:27.62
What's here to admire?

236
0:27:29.16 --> 0:27:30.58
lt's not a city

237
0:27:31.16 --> 0:27:33.00
Oleg

238
0:27:33.08 --> 0:27:36.21
Otherwise

239
0:27:36.29 --> 0:27:37.96
Why get married?

240
0:27:38.04 --> 0:27:43.51
l've read that Moscow is 14th on the list of the world's most polluted cities.

241
0:27:44.13 --> 0:27:46.05
Baku is top of the list

242
0:27:46.14 --> 0:27:48.01
Oleg

243
0:27:48.10 --> 0:27:49.76
Vovchik has turned up.

244
0:27:52.14 --> 0:27:53.27
Let's go.

245
0:28:00.57 --> 0:28:02.69
Well

246
0:28:03.28 --> 0:28:05.57
A worthy death

247
0:28:07.07 --> 0:28:09.57
lf he'd been a Viking

248
0:28:20.88 --> 0:28:22.21
What shall we do?

249
0:28:22.30 --> 0:28:25.67
- Hole up for a couple of days

250
0:28:27.63 --> 0:28:29.26
Why did we get together

251
0:28:29.64 --> 0:28:31.60
Why should we give up our business?

252
0:28:31.68 --> 0:28:34.68
There's one less of us

253
0:28:34.77 --> 0:28:36.18
What do you think

254
0:28:39.98 --> 0:28:41.73
We should get out of here.

255
0:28:42.61 --> 0:28:45.86
Someone must have tipped the cops off. This place may no longer be safe.

256
0:28:45.94 --> 0:28:47.53
Yeah

257
0:28:48.74 --> 0:28:49.91
There always is.

258
0:28:54.12 --> 0:28:56.08
Well

259
0:28:56.16 --> 0:29:00.50
Once

260
0:29:00.58 --> 0:29:03.79
He'd hooked up with a chick and they wanted to smoke some weed

261
0:29:03.88 --> 0:29:07.09
so they ordered a home delivery. Like a pizza

262
0:29:07.17 --> 0:29:08.22
What's the address?

263
0:29:08.30 --> 0:29:10.97
What address? l've only been there once in my life!

264
0:29:14.81 --> 0:29:17.18
- Let's go

265
0:29:17.27 --> 0:29:19.60
- To Chertanovo.  - l'm at work here.

266
0:29:19.69 --> 0:29:22.52
What bloody work? Some worker...

267
0:29:25.53 --> 0:29:26.65
What floor?

268
0:29:26.74 --> 0:29:30.32
lt's on either the fourth or fifth floor. With a crappy door.

269
0:29:33.53 --> 0:29:35.70
- Come on

270
0:29:37.66 --> 0:29:38.75
What's up?

271
0:29:39.16 --> 0:29:42.83
That's not part of the deal

272
0:29:42.92 --> 0:29:45.46
And then they gave you the slip. This time

273
0:29:45.55 --> 0:29:48.42
Of course they will. That's your fate.

274
0:29:48.63 --> 0:29:50.22
No

275
0:29:51.18 --> 0:29:54.05
Won't you

276
0:29:54.14 --> 0:29:55.51
l'll rub you out myself!

277
0:30:00.81 --> 0:30:02.31
What a madhouse.

278
0:30:05.27 --> 0:30:07.07
Fine.

279
0:30:07.78 --> 0:30:10.36
Calm down. Calm down.

280
0:30:12.36 --> 0:30:14.03
We were joking

281
0:30:18.95 --> 0:30:20.87
- That's the door.  - You sure?

282
0:30:20.96 --> 0:30:22.21
Dead certain.

283
0:30:41.56 --> 0:30:48.48
Ladies and gentlemen

284
0:30:50.57 --> 0:30:52.11
We're having a party here.

285
0:30:58.29 --> 0:30:59.83
Too late.

286
0:31:11.92 --> 0:31:14.84
What now? Home to bed?

287
0:31:15.39 --> 0:31:17.68
No. Let's drive around the district a bit more.

288
0:31:18.31 --> 0:31:21.47
They've hardly gone far

289
0:31:22.73 --> 0:31:24.35
They're somewhere here.

290
0:31:27.11 --> 0:31:28.11
My inner voice tells me.

291
0:31:28.19 --> 0:31:30.57
That's not your inner voice

292
0:31:30.65 --> 0:31:32.44
That's how mine started.

293
0:31:36.24 --> 0:31:38.82
So

294
0:31:42.08 --> 0:31:45.21
Do you understand who the client is? What connections l'm offering?

295
0:31:45.92 --> 0:31:49.71
All right

296
0:31:53.72 --> 0:31:55.09
Look

297
0:31:56.59 --> 0:31:57.84
You're a genius!

298
0:32:17.95 --> 0:32:21.03
They went that way. Over there.

299
0:32:27.08 --> 0:32:28.58
Your documents

300
0:32:30.42 --> 0:32:32.55
Our cops are working hard

301
0:32:32.63 --> 0:32:34.13
Bit insolent though.

302
0:32:55.61 --> 0:32:56.94
Attention!

303
0:32:56.95 --> 0:32:59.20
- At ease!  - At ease!

304
0:32:59.28 --> 0:33:01.03
Special forces troopers!

305
0:33:01.12 --> 0:33:07.08
Our mission is to neutralise a dangerous criminal gang.

306
0:33:08.00 --> 0:33:12.59
We are also duty bound to avenge our comrades who fell yesterday.

307
0:33:12.67 --> 0:33:14.80
Let us be worthy of their cherished memory!

308
0:33:15.71 --> 0:33:20.63
Lieutenant-General Boldyrev will personally take command.

309
0:33:21.72 --> 0:33:26.31
This means that those distinguishing themselves will be rewarded

310
0:33:26.39 --> 0:33:30.19
and those screwing up will get the opposite treatment.

311
0:33:30.27 --> 0:33:35.27
Now deputy operational commander Captain Verbitskaya

312
0:33:35.36 --> 0:33:38.44
will explain some technical details.

313
0:33:41.20 --> 0:33:42.28
Men!

314
0:33:43.78 --> 0:33:48.66
Today you are not just special forces troops

315
0:33:49.58 --> 0:33:54.04
but participants in a unique media project!

316
0:33:54.71 --> 0:33:59.26
You will all be issued with miniature video cameras

317
0:33:59.34 --> 0:34:02.43
that will be attached to your helmets using special fasteners.

318
0:34:03.80 --> 0:34:10.77
Millions of TV viewers will be able to follow your every move virtually live.

319
0:34:15.52 --> 0:34:18.86
What are you worried about

320
0:34:18.99 --> 0:34:21.40
That's easy for you to say. This stuff costs fifty grand!

321
0:34:21.49 --> 0:34:26.28
So what? You're letting the cops

322
0:34:26.37 --> 0:34:28.62
Nobody will steal your precious cameras.

323
0:34:28.70 --> 0:34:29.83
Are you sure?

324
0:34:29.91 --> 0:34:35.08
Just consider the product placement value in such a top-rated show.

325
0:34:35.17 --> 0:34:38.17
At today's prices that's worth far more than fifty thousand.

326
0:34:38.26 --> 0:34:42.17
lnformation received suggests the suspects were spotted in Chertanovo.

327
0:34:42.26 --> 0:34:44.47
An old lady recognised the photo.

328
0:34:44.55 --> 0:34:49.39
Two patrols are on duty there. We're in contact and awaiting confirmation.

329
0:34:49.47 --> 0:34:52.60
No need to wait. Action is always better than inaction.

330
0:34:52.69 --> 0:34:55.35
lf they're there

331
0:34:55.44 --> 0:34:57.90
And if not

332
0:34:57.90 --> 0:34:59.69
Following up leads and suchlike.

333
0:35:04.16 --> 0:35:06.62
What are we supposed to do with it? How's it switched on?

334
0:35:06.70 --> 0:35:08.87
Just make sure you don't touch anything.

335
0:35:08.95 --> 0:35:11.45
They're all switched on from central command.

336
0:35:12.46 --> 0:35:14.83
- To your places!  - At the double! Come on now!

337
0:35:25.22 --> 0:35:26.64
An incredible block.

338
0:35:27.10 --> 0:35:29.05
Well

339
0:35:29.64 --> 0:35:31.10
That old woman is hardly reliable.

340
0:35:31.93 --> 0:35:35.60
Why not? lf l was a criminal

341
0:35:35.69 --> 0:35:40.07
- Do you read me? You understand?  - Yes

342
0:35:55.25 --> 0:35:57.79
- So

343
0:36:02.13 --> 0:36:05.93
We're off the case. Special forces.

344
0:36:07.22 --> 0:36:10.35
Until they get here we keep the building under surveillance.

345
0:36:12.97 --> 0:36:14.39
Then we'll go home to bed.

346
0:37:11.87 --> 0:37:13.08
Herman

347
0:37:14.20 --> 0:37:17.50
Four in plain clothes are already in the block. We need to split.

348
0:37:19.37 --> 0:37:21.96
Gotcha. See you on the eighth floor.

349
0:37:23.88 --> 0:37:25.17
We're leaving.

350
0:37:54.53 --> 0:37:57.62
Where are we going? All the entrances here connect up.

351
0:37:57.70 --> 0:38:01.21
- He could be anywhere

352
0:38:01.29 --> 0:38:04.00
Crazy architecture! Never seen anything like this.

353
0:38:07.92 --> 0:38:12.30
Doesn't matter. We've got them cornered. Now

354
0:38:16.51 --> 0:38:19.64
Dear

355
0:38:19.73 --> 0:38:25.81
All these hunky guys in flak jackets

356
0:38:28.40 --> 0:38:32.57
And the great thing was nobody's interfered with my work yet. Just the opposite.

357
0:38:32.91 --> 0:38:37.58
OK

358
0:38:41.04 --> 0:38:42.71
Verbitskaya

359
0:38:42.79 --> 0:38:47.84
Firefight in Chertanovo. Smirnov's team reports they are in pursuit.

360
0:38:47.92 --> 0:38:52.80
Call them off immediately! Everyone must stick to the plan!

361
0:38:52.88 --> 0:38:56.39
Nobody does anything until we get there.

362
0:38:56.47 --> 0:38:59.72
Have them block the entrances and wait for us.

363
0:39:18.37 --> 0:39:19.62
Fall out!

364
0:39:20.87 --> 0:39:22.33
To your positions!

365
0:39:25.08 --> 0:39:27.00
Quickly!

366
0:39:37.10 --> 0:39:40.39
How did they find us? Some bastard has ratted on us.

367
0:39:40.47 --> 0:39:43.06
Valera

368
0:40:13.63 --> 0:40:17.47
Look

369
0:40:18.39 --> 0:40:21.93
l understand you're in a traffic jam but you'll be in time

370
0:40:59.09 --> 0:41:00.34
What's this?

371
0:41:00.43 --> 0:41:03.35
Valhalla. The official mineral water of our operation.

372
0:41:05.64 --> 0:41:06.89
What water?

373
0:41:07.94 --> 0:41:09.27
Pure and ecological.

374
0:41:09.94 --> 0:41:12.90
Don't worry

375
0:41:12.98 --> 0:41:16.94
Our troops need to drink. And the reporters won't say no to a freebie.

376
0:41:17.03 --> 0:41:22.28
Free

377
0:41:22.37 --> 0:41:25.20
They should pay us for the honour.

378
0:41:25.29 --> 0:41:26.87
We can talk about that later.

379
0:41:26.96 --> 0:41:34.00
We'll hold the first press conference in about 40 minutes when everyone is here.

380
0:41:34.09 --> 0:41:35.30
Who's that biker?

381
0:41:38.72 --> 0:41:39.84
ls he also with you?

382
0:41:44.68 --> 0:41:47.77
He's not a biker. He is a well-known director.

383
0:41:48.48 --> 0:41:52.56
Perhaps the best. At least in advertising.

384
0:41:53.44 --> 0:41:54.98
ls he cleared for security?

385
0:41:54.98 --> 0:41:57.07
- Yes

386
0:42:46.91 --> 0:42:48.04
Sanya! Grenades!

387
0:42:54.75 --> 0:42:57.34
My God! What was that? A gas explosion?

388
0:43:05.26 --> 0:43:08.14
Have they all gone raving mad up there?

389
0:43:08.22 --> 0:43:10.06
Why? They're catching criminals!

390
0:43:10.14 --> 0:43:13.31
Get me a walkie-talkie! l'll talk to this Smirnov myself right now.

391
0:43:13.81 --> 0:43:15.27
Smirnov?

392
0:43:16.31 --> 0:43:17.56
Major Smirnov?

393
0:43:17.65 --> 0:43:20.32
Call him Tambov. lt's his call sign.

394
0:43:21.78 --> 0:43:23.49
Tambov! Do you read me?

395
0:43:24.11 --> 0:43:26.20
ls he deaf? Tambov!

396
0:43:27.58 --> 0:43:29.16
Smirnov!

397
0:43:30.20 --> 0:43:31.79
Major Smirnov!

398
0:43:31.87 --> 0:43:35.92
Tambov! Do you read me?

399
0:43:47.26 --> 0:43:48.39
Tambov's here.

400
0:43:49.97 --> 0:43:53.56
This is Captain Verbitskaya. What are you up to?

401
0:43:55.40 --> 0:43:57.19
Grenades. Anti-personnel.

402
0:43:58.11 --> 0:44:01.40
Almost cut us to ribbons. This floor is clear

403
0:44:01.48 --> 0:44:04.61
Major

404
0:44:05.24 --> 0:44:09.91
You were stood down long ago. l order you to leave the building immediately.

405
0:44:10.33 --> 0:44:11.41
Do you understand me?

406
0:44:11.49 --> 0:44:13.04
She's giving me orders?

407
0:44:15.16 --> 0:44:16.62
Who am l speaking to?

408
0:44:18.54 --> 0:44:21.13
Deputy chief of the operational HQ.

409
0:44:27.55 --> 0:44:29.22
Captain

410
0:44:29.30 --> 0:44:31.39
There are no special forces troops on our floor.

411
0:44:31.47 --> 0:44:34.68
You can block the stairways and start combing the lower floors.

412
0:44:34.77 --> 0:44:38.35
Listen

413
0:44:38.44 --> 0:44:40.94
This is a special operation.

414
0:44:41.02 --> 0:44:45.78
l've no time or desire to explain all its details.

415
0:44:45.86 --> 0:44:49.20
Just follow orders and don't get in the way of professionals.

416
0:44:50.58 --> 0:44:52.08
Understood?

417
0:44:53.37 --> 0:44:54.83
l repeat

418
0:45:01.63 --> 0:45:02.67
Understood.

419
0:45:05.72 --> 0:45:08.59
So

420
0:45:09.39 --> 0:45:12.85
lmmediately! Get all the inhabitants out of there.

421
0:45:14.06 --> 0:45:16.48
Stop smiling. You're not on the dance floor.

422
0:45:19.31 --> 0:45:20.65
So what do we do now?

423
0:45:23.19 --> 0:45:24.98
Bitch!

424
0:45:26.24 --> 0:45:28.40
Verbitskaya. Where the hell did they get hold of her?

425
0:45:28.49 --> 0:45:31.70
You remember there was a General Verbitskiy

426
0:45:31.78 --> 0:45:35.95
Died a couple of years ago. l heard about him getting his daughter a very cushy job.

427
0:45:36.04 --> 0:45:39.66
- lt's probably her

428
0:45:41.08 --> 0:45:42.88
l have to kiss her arse now?

429
0:45:43.92 --> 0:45:45.75
Verbitskaya

430
0:45:49.09 --> 0:45:50.72
What are you sitting here for?

431
0:45:52.85 --> 0:45:56.06
Rise and shine! Let's go and check out the seventh floor.

432
0:46:08.82 --> 0:46:12.11
Today you have a unique opportunity to watch

433
0:46:12.20 --> 0:46:14.70
the capture of a dangerous gang live on TV.

434
0:46:14.78 --> 0:46:17.12
Criminals hiding out in this block were involved

435
0:46:17.20 --> 0:46:19.62
in yesterday's shootout in central Moscow.

436
0:46:19.71 --> 0:46:24.00
Every half-hour there'll be a live update on the progress of this operation.

437
0:46:24.09 --> 0:46:28.63
Helping us is deputy head of PR at Moscow police headquarters

438
0:46:28.71 --> 0:46:30.55
Ekaterina Verbitskaya.

439
0:46:31.22 --> 0:46:33.30
Good afternoon

440
0:46:49.36 --> 0:46:54.41
Residents of block twenty-eight

441
0:46:54.49 --> 0:46:56.41
Well

442
0:46:56.49 --> 0:47:00.58
Get your documents and wait in your apartments.

443
0:47:00.66 --> 0:47:04.79
Law enforcement officers will take you to safety.

444
0:47:04.88 --> 0:47:10.05
Dad

445
0:47:10.13 --> 0:47:15.39
Son

446
0:47:15.47 --> 0:47:17.97
You should listen to them and do the opposite.

447
0:47:19.68 --> 0:47:23.23
When you grow up

448
0:47:23.64 --> 0:47:26.06
Besides

449
0:47:27.32 --> 0:47:28.40
Hello.

450
0:47:30.28 --> 0:47:33.07
You should have listened to the cops

451
0:47:33.95 --> 0:47:36.57
We've got to go to Grandma's

452
0:47:36.66 --> 0:47:38.20
Here's your granny!

453
0:47:41.50 --> 0:47:45.12
You're policemen

454
0:47:45.21 --> 0:47:48.96
Policemen don't point their guns at regular people. They're gangsters!

455
0:47:49.05 --> 0:47:50.71
The son is smarter than his dad.

456
0:47:50.80 --> 0:47:52.42
You're gangsters?

457
0:47:53.05 --> 0:47:57.89
But we've got nothing. We're ordinary people! l'm just a taxi driver.

458
0:47:57.97 --> 0:48:01.89
Smile

459
0:48:01.97 --> 0:48:04.81
Don't be shy!

460
0:48:04.89 --> 0:48:10.02
Please

461
0:48:10.11 --> 0:48:13.61
Stop clucking

462
0:48:13.69 --> 0:48:18.20
Smile

463
0:48:18.28 --> 0:48:19.41
Kley!

464
0:48:23.70 --> 0:48:27.50
You're always like this! lt's all your fault

465
0:48:29.63 --> 0:48:32.63
We won't harm you. Just stay with you a while.

466
0:48:33.96 --> 0:48:35.55
My God

467
0:48:35.63 --> 0:48:39.97
Draw the blinds

468
0:48:41.31 --> 0:48:42.56
Stop fidgeting.

469
0:48:44.56 --> 0:48:49.94
Evacuate the building! Collect your documents and go to the exit.

470
0:48:51.86 --> 0:48:54.94
Leave now! Evacuate the building!

471
0:49:00.83 --> 0:49:02.74
Take your documents.

472
0:49:05.25 --> 0:49:08.42
There's an evacuation. l'll call you back.

473
0:49:08.50 --> 0:49:13.25
Please remain calm. You are being evacuated.

474
0:49:13.59 --> 0:49:17.97
Get your documents and wait in your apartments.

475
0:49:18.05 --> 0:49:22.51
Law enforcement officers will take you to safety.

476
0:49:32.82 --> 0:49:35.94
Orda

477
0:49:36.03 --> 0:49:37.99
We're on the 1 1 th floor

478
0:49:38.07 --> 0:49:39.49
Keep your cell phone on.

479
0:49:39.57 --> 0:49:42.45
Got you

480
0:49:46.95 --> 0:49:50.25
lt's so noisy! Everybody's running! Shouting!

481
0:49:50.33 --> 0:49:53.21
How would you assess the police evacuation operation?

482
0:49:53.29 --> 0:49:57.92
Well

483
0:49:58.76 --> 0:50:01.63
- Were they polite to you?  - Yes

484
0:50:01.72 --> 0:50:03.39
They rang the doorbell and said:

485
0:50:03.47 --> 0:50:07.97
"Come on

486
0:50:08.06 --> 0:50:10.27
Listen

487
0:50:10.35 --> 0:50:13.56
Do you understand yourself what you want to shoot here?

488
0:50:14.32 --> 0:50:15.77
Roman

489
0:50:15.86 --> 0:50:19.57
lt's all about to start and we'll handle whatever comes along.

490
0:50:19.65 --> 0:50:23.82
About to start? lt's already begun! Or do grenades explode all the time here?

491
0:50:24.41 --> 0:50:26.66
And you don't even know yourself what'll happen next.

492
0:50:26.74 --> 0:50:28.75
Are you scared?

493
0:50:29.66 --> 0:50:32.46
No

494
0:50:32.54 --> 0:50:35.04
By the way

495
0:50:35.13 --> 0:50:38.76
lt's common knowledge how all your special operations finish.

496
0:50:40.63 --> 0:50:44.18
Walk down the corridor! Don't stop.

497
0:50:44.26 --> 0:50:46.64
Go on. Have your documents ready.

498
0:50:48.27 --> 0:50:49.43
Stop!

499
0:50:49.85 --> 0:50:51.39
You there in the leather jacket! Stop!

500
0:50:52.06 --> 0:50:53.44
Are you deaf?

501
0:51:16.54 --> 0:51:17.59
Hurry!

502
0:51:18.50 --> 0:51:19.88
After them

503
0:51:39.61 --> 0:51:40.94
Grandpa!

504
0:51:42.24 --> 0:51:44.45
- Grandpa!  - Looks like he's deaf.

505
0:51:45.95 --> 0:51:50.24
Grandpa

506
0:52:40.42 --> 0:52:43.46
- Orda.  - Herman

507
0:52:43.55 --> 0:52:45.76
- How many?  - Five

508
0:52:49.09 --> 0:52:50.85
Try to get to us. We'll meet you.

509
0:53:55.24 --> 0:53:56.83
Herman

510
0:53:57.41 --> 0:53:59.87
- Don't shoot! lt's Orda!  - Where is he?

511
0:54:06.30 --> 0:54:07.34
Upper floor?

512
0:54:11.43 --> 0:54:13.30
Are you wounded?

513
0:54:42.54 --> 0:54:46.75
lf you feel like shooting

514
0:54:46.84 --> 0:54:48.09
l noticed.

515
0:54:48.76 --> 0:54:50.01
Who are you?

516
0:54:50.88 --> 0:54:55.93
Us? We're doctors. And you?

517
0:54:57.85 --> 0:54:59.60
We're doctors without borders.

518
0:55:15.91 --> 0:55:18.28
And l'm Yuri.

519
0:55:19.50 --> 0:55:21.12
But you can call me just Yura.

520
0:55:21.21 --> 0:55:23.46
- Daddy!  - What?

521
0:55:23.96 --> 0:55:26.08
We're all in the same boat here!

522
0:55:27.88 --> 0:55:29.55
A submarine.

523
0:55:31.55 --> 0:55:34.22
The first battle has definitely been lost.

524
0:55:34.80 --> 0:55:36.14
What about the wounded?

525
0:55:36.22 --> 0:55:41.10
Being evacuated via entrance No. 8. We cleared the place of journalists.

526
0:55:41.18 --> 0:55:45.73
There are from five to seven gangsters. They're holed up in apartment 1 28

527
0:55:45.81 --> 0:55:48.73
home to taxi driver Yury Shirokov and his two children.

528
0:55:48.82 --> 0:55:51.65
l spoke to the Kremlin half an hour ago.

529
0:55:54.78 --> 0:55:59.99
lf innocent people die during the operation

530
0:56:01.83 --> 0:56:03.87
and it's shown live on TV

531
0:56:05.08 --> 0:56:07.04
they will not forgive us our mistakes.

532
0:56:09.96 --> 0:56:15.63
For now

533
0:56:17.09 --> 0:56:21.43
l would prefer to conclude the operation in the evening

534
0:56:22.10 --> 0:56:23.27
which is peak prime time.

535
0:56:23.35 --> 0:56:25.23
Stop talking to me about the evening!

536
0:56:25.89 --> 0:56:27.73
What should we do now?

537
0:56:29.65 --> 0:56:32.65
What are you going to show the press? Not this

538
0:56:34.15 --> 0:56:35.36
Prime time!

539
0:56:36.20 --> 0:56:40.41
Katya

540
0:56:41.20 --> 0:56:43.49
- Yes.  - So it's already digitised?

541
0:56:43.58 --> 0:56:46.71
Katya

542
0:56:46.79 --> 0:56:49.04
We can extract everything we need from it.

543
0:56:49.13 --> 0:56:53.00
- What do you think?  - Sure

544
0:56:53.09 --> 0:56:55.01
Roma

545
0:56:55.72 --> 0:56:59.05
l still don't quite get what we are going to do.

546
0:56:59.14 --> 0:57:00.93
Get ready for the press conference!

547
0:57:04.22 --> 0:57:11.31
Two explosions over the last hour

548
0:57:11.52 --> 0:57:12.90
Hey

549
0:57:12.98 --> 0:57:16.07
A Moscow police spokesman claimed officers exchanged fire with the gang.

550
0:57:16.15 --> 0:57:17.45
Look!

551
0:57:17.53 --> 0:57:21.16
A Beretta 92. 9mm calibre.

552
0:57:21.24 --> 0:57:24.16
A 1 6-round semi-automatic pistol.

553
0:57:24.24 --> 0:57:31.04
Made completely out of stainless steel. Very rare

554
0:57:31.13 --> 0:57:36.21
- Hold it. So

555
0:57:36.72 --> 0:57:39.05
When you grow up

556
0:57:39.13 --> 0:57:41.76
Listen

557
0:57:42.89 --> 0:57:45.31
He may yet grow up to be a normal person.

558
0:57:45.39 --> 0:57:50.73
What was it l said? You'd think normal people don't carry guns.

559
0:57:50.81 --> 0:57:52.19
Kley

560
0:57:53.48 --> 0:57:55.69
OK

561
0:58:01.82 --> 0:58:05.45
At 1 6:35

562
0:58:05.54 --> 0:58:14.00
There were more gangsters than we anticipated. Our troops returned fire.

563
0:58:14.09 --> 0:58:17.34
And the criminals cowardly retreated into an apartment

564
0:58:17.42 --> 0:58:18.84
where they probably have taken hostages.

565
0:58:20.05 --> 0:58:22.18
Now we know where they are.

566
0:58:22.26 --> 0:58:25.39
The first stage of this operation has been completed successfully.

567
0:58:25.47 --> 0:58:31.10
Our top priority is to avoid civilian casualties.

568
0:58:31.19 --> 0:58:33.77
Successfully completed? Bullshit!

569
0:58:33.98 --> 0:58:37.61
So? lf you want to hear the truth on TV

570
0:58:37.69 --> 0:58:39.32
The rest is just all lies.

571
0:58:39.40 --> 0:58:41.70
They're not lying. lt's a reality show.

572
0:58:42.49 --> 0:58:45.66
They might have a show

573
0:58:46.62 --> 0:58:48.16
Look!

574
0:58:49.79 --> 0:58:53.29
Do something useful instead. Bloody Spielberg wannabe.

575
0:59:00.76 --> 0:59:03.59
- Hey

576
0:59:03.68 --> 0:59:05.72
- Listen

577
0:59:05.80 --> 0:59:08.39
You can't play Entropia without the internet working!

578
0:59:08.97 --> 0:59:10.85
Can you connect a phone to your computer?

579
0:59:10.93 --> 0:59:13.02
Yes

580
0:59:13.73 --> 0:59:15.52
My son is a computer genius.

581
0:59:15.61 --> 0:59:18.44
See the computer l bought him? Had to take a loan for it.

582
0:59:18.53 --> 0:59:22.19
He'll do anything you ask him to.

583
0:59:22.28 --> 0:59:23.49
l'm not helping criminals!

584
0:59:23.57 --> 0:59:27.24
What do you mean you're not helping? Do what the man says right now!

585
0:59:27.33 --> 0:59:29.20
You're a coward.

586
0:59:29.29 --> 0:59:33.54
We're not suggesting you do anything bad. We're just telling people the truth.

587
0:59:33.62 --> 0:59:36.92
Listen

588
0:59:37.00 --> 0:59:40.55
And don't disrespect your father

589
0:59:40.63 --> 0:59:42.88
OK

590
0:59:42.97 --> 0:59:44.63
Of course. Here you are.

591
0:59:45.84 --> 0:59:48.64
My daughter is also good at computers.

592
0:59:50.64 --> 0:59:52.73
She hangs out online all day long.

593
1:00:04.61 --> 1:00:08.07
So

594
1:00:08.16 --> 1:00:12.45
Once again we look like complete idiots!

595
1:00:12.54 --> 1:00:14.33
The criminals are always one step ahead of us.

596
1:00:14.41 --> 1:00:16.96
What does it have to do with me? lt's your material.

597
1:00:17.04 --> 1:00:19.00
What else is there for me to work with?

598
1:00:19.09 --> 1:00:21.75
All l can do is to propose an editing solution.

599
1:00:21.84 --> 1:00:26.68
Hold on. They've declared an information war on us. But they don't stand a chance.

600
1:00:26.76 --> 1:00:30.18
- We hold all the aces.  - l hear this all day.

601
1:00:30.64 --> 1:00:32.22
What exactly are you proposing?

602
1:00:33.68 --> 1:00:37.69
Of course

603
1:00:38.56 --> 1:00:41.11
Can't you hack into this damned "mail.ru"?

604
1:00:41.69 --> 1:00:44.49
l'm afraid not. Most likely they've sent it elsewhere too.

605
1:00:44.57 --> 1:00:48.24
lf they're smart enough they might have sent their footage to all the news agencies

606
1:00:48.32 --> 1:00:49.95
and TV channels... Already.

607
1:00:51.28 --> 1:00:54.37
Are you aware of what you're saying?

608
1:00:56.42 --> 1:00:59.17
Do you realise what it means for us?

609
1:01:00.54 --> 1:01:01.79
l am.

610
1:01:03.00 --> 1:01:05.01
And l'm preparing countermeasures.

611
1:01:05.76 --> 1:01:07.76
l'll write a new press release.

612
1:01:08.39 --> 1:01:14.06
lt'll show these gangsters as terrorists who took two small children hostage.

613
1:01:16.06 --> 1:01:17.35
Terrorists?

614
1:01:21.19 --> 1:01:22.65
That's good.

615
1:01:24.11 --> 1:01:26.11
That's right. Get on with it!

616
1:01:28.53 --> 1:01:32.53
l need high-quality photographs of these kids.

617
1:01:32.62 --> 1:01:35.95
Get in touch with the school they go to or find their relatives.

618
1:01:36.04 --> 1:01:38.71
By any means necessary get me

619
1:01:38.79 --> 1:01:41.46
heart-warming photos of these kids within an hour.

620
1:01:41.54 --> 1:01:46.13
So that all female viewers' hearts will just melt.

621
1:01:46.97 --> 1:01:55.22
And cut all telephone and cable lines in this block that allow internet access.

622
1:01:57.14 --> 1:02:01.23
Great job! And the picture quality is good.

623
1:02:03.73 --> 1:02:05.65
Your little video clip doesn't make any sense.

624
1:02:05.73 --> 1:02:08.74
You uploaded it to the internet but they've got all the TV channels.

625
1:02:08.82 --> 1:02:11.41
At least

626
1:02:14.49 --> 1:02:17.24
- Maybe we should eat something?  - l don't want to eat.

627
1:02:18.75 --> 1:02:21.08
- Did you do your homework?  - l'm not doing my homework!

628
1:02:22.04 --> 1:02:25.09
We're hostages

629
1:02:25.71 --> 1:02:29.84
And what if they don't kill us? Then we have to go to school tomorrow.

630
1:02:29.93 --> 1:02:31.63
l'm not doing any homework anyway!

631
1:02:31.72 --> 1:02:34.18
You are! Do what you're told.

632
1:02:36.26 --> 1:02:39.64
Completely out of hand. Doesn't want to study.

633
1:02:40.27 --> 1:02:42.10
Playing on his computer is all he cares about.

634
1:02:42.19 --> 1:02:44.86
Every week the school calls me in for a talking-to.

635
1:02:46.23 --> 1:02:49.07
You want me to try to have some positive influence on him?

636
1:02:50.90 --> 1:02:55.03
Son

637
1:02:55.12 --> 1:02:57.99
Cops always on your tail. Do you really need that?

638
1:02:58.08 --> 1:03:00.54
- Yura

639
1:03:00.62 --> 1:03:02.21
Then make something for us all.

640
1:03:02.29 --> 1:03:05.38
Take a photo of me in this outfit with my bike. Then l'll take yours.

641
1:03:06.96 --> 1:03:09.00
So what was the press conference like?

642
1:03:09.76 --> 1:03:11.01
How were the reporters?

643
1:03:11.59 --> 1:03:14.89
Buzzing like a swarm of bees but swallowed everything l told them.

644
1:03:14.97 --> 1:03:17.26
Now everyone feels for the poor children.

645
1:03:19.06 --> 1:03:23.56
Look over there. They're already on air. Good work.

646
1:03:28.57 --> 1:03:30.44
Because of you the internet is down.

647
1:03:30.53 --> 1:03:35.24
- How can l do my homework now?  - How is that my fault?

648
1:03:35.24 --> 1:03:39.33
Hand me your Skylink

649
1:03:40.45 --> 1:03:42.45
lnteresting

650
1:03:43.04 --> 1:03:45.08
Look at your daddy

651
1:04:07.02 --> 1:04:08.11
Need any help?

652
1:04:17.24 --> 1:04:20.91
Want some coke? Come on.

653
1:04:50.57 --> 1:04:52.36
Can your father really cook?

654
1:04:52.73 --> 1:04:57.45
No. He can only use the microwave. Granny comes over to do the cooking.

655
1:05:12.71 --> 1:05:14.92
Hey

656
1:05:16.51 --> 1:05:19.13
- Shoot him

657
1:05:21.72 --> 1:05:28.02
- Great stuff! Come on. Let's go again.  - Don't stop

658
1:05:28.10 --> 1:05:32.02
What are you doing? Don't daydream! Can't you see he's attacking?

659
1:05:33.86 --> 1:05:37.03
Drive him into the corner! Fire!

660
1:05:45.04 --> 1:05:46.75
1 Kostikova Street. 6pm

661
1:05:55.38 --> 1:05:59.76
Yura

662
1:06:01.01 --> 1:06:03.60
Keep an eye on the potatoes.

663
1:06:05.18 --> 1:06:06.31
Pass me the knife.

664
1:06:13.61 --> 1:06:16.65
Did you leave your jacket there to test my curiosity?

665
1:06:16.74 --> 1:06:18.19
Maybe l did.

666
1:06:22.82 --> 1:06:25.49
l had a different image of your line of work.

667
1:06:27.41 --> 1:06:31.17
But you've got a partner and a photo in your pocket. Against all the rules

668
1:06:31.25 --> 1:06:33.79
TV has ruined you youngsters.

669
1:06:34.67 --> 1:06:36.09
Rules...

670
1:06:36.42 --> 1:06:40.63
You know

671
1:06:44.89 --> 1:06:46.35
ls there any basil here?

672
1:06:46.43 --> 1:06:48.64
- Only dill.  - That'll do.

673
1:06:53.48 --> 1:06:55.81
Are you familiar with this apartment block?

674
1:06:58.86 --> 1:06:59.99
What's your plan?

675
1:07:07.12 --> 1:07:08.79
What an optimist you are.

676
1:07:10.75 --> 1:07:12.58
l'm just starting to fall behind.

677
1:07:14.42 --> 1:07:16.50
The best plan is not to have a plan.

678
1:07:23.01 --> 1:07:26.72
- You like your food spicy?  - Yes.

679
1:07:29.60 --> 1:07:32.35
Well

680
1:07:32.44 --> 1:07:35.56
- lt'll be ready soon.  - Get a move on!

681
1:07:38.32 --> 1:07:39.57
And young four-eyes?

682
1:07:41.07 --> 1:07:42.49
Valera?

683
1:07:43.82 --> 1:07:46.91
Well

684
1:07:48.62 --> 1:07:50.33
lt's a tough business.

685
1:07:53.41 --> 1:07:59.88
Police HQ is now trying to establish contact with the gang holding the hostages

686
1:07:59.96 --> 1:08:05.22
in order to conduct negotiations. Here's our special correspondent Olga Stolyarova.

687
1:08:22.28 --> 1:08:26.24
You're watching PBK and a special edition of the Market Report.

688
1:08:26.32 --> 1:08:29.20
lnvestors reacted negatively to the events in central Moscow.

689
1:08:29.28 --> 1:08:30.91
Blue-chip stocks were down by around 5%...

690
1:08:31.79 --> 1:08:35.25
Once again l urge you to contact us.

691
1:08:35.33 --> 1:08:38.38
Your only way out of the current situation

692
1:08:38.46 --> 1:08:40.59
is to release the hostages and surrender.

693
1:08:40.67 --> 1:08:43.38
Please don't make an already difficult situation...

694
1:08:43.46 --> 1:08:46.22
Come on! Come on

695
1:08:47.22 --> 1:08:51.43
Vadik

696
1:08:52.43 --> 1:08:56.64
- Got any vodka?  - No

697
1:08:57.65 --> 1:09:00.77
What with the kids

698
1:09:01.82 --> 1:09:07.03
But l've got a bottle of Ararat

699
1:09:09.12 --> 1:09:12.24
Here we go. Come on now!

700
1:09:13.29 --> 1:09:15.70
lt's 20 years old. l thought you were hard up.

701
1:09:15.79 --> 1:09:22.17
A present from a regular customer. l've had it for ages.

702
1:09:22.25 --> 1:09:25.46
Never opened. No time

703
1:09:25.55 --> 1:09:30.97
Dude

704
1:09:31.05 --> 1:09:33.31
lsn't that true

705
1:09:35.22 --> 1:09:40.40
Well

706
1:09:41.44 --> 1:09:48.70
l'd never make anything this delicious even with the same stuff.

707
1:09:48.78 --> 1:09:51.87
Kids

708
1:09:54.99 --> 1:09:58.62
Listen

709
1:09:58.71 --> 1:10:01.25
Maybe he can't stand eating at the same table as us.

710
1:10:02.29 --> 1:10:04.92
Or are you afraid the cops will grab your dessert?

711
1:10:05.00 --> 1:10:06.13
Kley!

712
1:10:06.21 --> 1:10:09.88
Guys

713
1:10:13.43 --> 1:10:18.77
Let's drink to us getting acquainted.

714
1:10:21.35 --> 1:10:24.82
Come on

715
1:10:29.40 --> 1:10:32.53
Vadik! Sit down.

716
1:10:34.66 --> 1:10:37.58
Don't be mad at him. That's just the way he is.

717
1:10:37.66 --> 1:10:41.87
You understand

718
1:10:41.96 --> 1:10:44.42
and nothing but shootouts and car chases!

719
1:10:44.50 --> 1:10:48.13
Not like in our day

720
1:10:48.21 --> 1:10:51.34
Not like kids nowadays? Well

721
1:10:53.05 --> 1:10:58.60
lt was so much better when we grew up. Let's drink.

722
1:10:59.31 --> 1:11:02.10
Vadik

723
1:11:03.23 --> 1:11:07.44
When you grow up you'll become a cop and catch guys like us.

724
1:11:08.82 --> 1:11:11.32
l also wanted to be a cop once.

725
1:11:25.96 --> 1:11:28.05
Let's drink.

726
1:11:30.21 --> 1:11:34.38
They don't look like ruthless terrorists.

727
1:11:35.14 --> 1:11:36.89
Look.

728
1:11:39.81 --> 1:11:41.89
Why don't we take a lunch break too?

729
1:11:41.98 --> 1:11:46.35
We never take lunch breaks during operations.

730
1:11:46.44 --> 1:11:47.86
We always manage without food.

731
1:11:47.94 --> 1:11:52.07
Don't forget this is an unusual operation

732
1:11:52.15 --> 1:11:58.03
l want to show that cops are normal human beings and they also need food.

733
1:11:59.29 --> 1:12:00.83
This is a clever move.

734
1:12:02.25 --> 1:12:05.29
We'll feed the reporters too. That lot love their freebies.

735
1:12:05.37 --> 1:12:10.00
Yan

736
1:12:10.84 --> 1:12:12.09
Watching TV now?

737
1:12:13.13 --> 1:12:14.55
Good boy.

738
1:12:14.63 --> 1:12:18.05
Your restaurant does home delivery

739
1:12:19.72 --> 1:12:24.39
l've got a fantastic offer for you.

740
1:12:40.58 --> 1:12:43.91
Where are we going

741
1:12:45.79 --> 1:12:47.62
- Are you OK?  - Yes. Fine

742
1:12:47.71 --> 1:12:49.84
Maybe we should contact HQ.

743
1:12:49.92 --> 1:12:51.67
No need to contact anyone.

744
1:12:54.22 --> 1:12:55.51
They're here somewhere.

745
1:12:58.30 --> 1:13:02.06
- l feel it.  - Feel it? l feel it too!

746
1:13:02.14 --> 1:13:04.10
Been on the force so many years.

747
1:13:04.18 --> 1:13:06.81
ln the movies people like me are always killed first.

748
1:13:06.89 --> 1:13:11.40
And look at me now

749
1:13:11.48 --> 1:13:15.19
And why? Experience! Experience and premonitions too!

750
1:13:55.23 --> 1:13:59.03
Look

751
1:14:00.03 --> 1:14:02.12
Tearing his nuts off would be too good for him!

752
1:14:08.37 --> 1:14:09.46
What's your name?

753
1:14:14.63 --> 1:14:16.25
Crackpot.

754
1:14:17.13 --> 1:14:18.42
Everyone calls me that.

755
1:14:19.26 --> 1:14:21.93
Why did you get into the closet

756
1:14:24.01 --> 1:14:29.23
Demons are after me. They come after sunset.

757
1:14:30.31 --> 1:14:36.11
What a great country! No one with brains

758
1:14:36.19 --> 1:14:37.57
Why did you shoot?

759
1:14:39.65 --> 1:14:42.66
- Are you deaf? Why did you shoot?  - l don't know.

760
1:14:42.74 --> 1:14:47.54
l'm conking out

761
1:14:47.62 --> 1:14:50.12
Well

762
1:14:51.17 --> 1:14:53.42
Can't waste my time on scum like you.

763
1:14:53.50 --> 1:14:56.75
But if l ever see you again

764
1:14:56.84 --> 1:14:59.26
Get it? Or shall l elaborate?

765
1:15:02.01 --> 1:15:04.76
Sod off! Get him out of here.

766
1:15:13.31 --> 1:15:14.60
They're eating sushi.

767
1:15:15.40 --> 1:15:19.23
- Did you ever try sushi?  - No.

768
1:15:22.41 --> 1:15:26.57
Oleg

769
1:16:10.41 --> 1:16:13.50
This sushi's not bad. For Moscow

770
1:16:14.17 --> 1:16:17.67
Especially with tuna. What do you say

771
1:16:19.80 --> 1:16:24.97
- Why aren't you eating

772
1:16:28.26 --> 1:16:30.10
We've hacked into their computer.

773
1:16:31.02 --> 1:16:34.85
Excellent. Can you connect me?

774
1:16:36.73 --> 1:16:40.32
Hey

775
1:16:41.44 --> 1:16:45.28
l am deputy chief of the operational HQ

776
1:16:46.66 --> 1:16:48.95
Who can l talk to?

777
1:16:55.16 --> 1:16:56.71
A TV star calling!

778
1:16:57.38 --> 1:16:59.38
Talk to me

779
1:17:01.13 --> 1:17:04.26
- Can l call you Katya?  - Call me what you like.

780
1:17:04.34 --> 1:17:08.43
l suggest that you immediately release the hostages and surrender.

781
1:17:09.47 --> 1:17:10.80
We can come to an agreement.

782
1:17:11.39 --> 1:17:18.02
Katya

783
1:17:19.19 --> 1:17:23.27
Actually

784
1:17:23.36 --> 1:17:24.73
Thank you.

785
1:17:25.82 --> 1:17:27.49
Pity l don't know what you look like.

786
1:17:27.57 --> 1:17:30.91
Pretty ugly. But l do have one advantage over you.

787
1:17:30.99 --> 1:17:32.53
l don't lie to people.

788
1:17:32.54 --> 1:17:35.12
Don't they say

789
1:17:35.20 --> 1:17:37.37
You just don't understand what l do.

790
1:17:38.08 --> 1:17:40.08
And you're no model citizen either.

791
1:17:40.50 --> 1:17:44.80
You rob banks

792
1:17:44.88 --> 1:17:49.09
This means we're two of a kind. We both know what's good and what's bad

793
1:17:49.18 --> 1:17:52.47
- but this doesn't bother us.  - lt's interesting to talk to you.

794
1:17:53.60 --> 1:17:57.27
To you too. Perhaps we could get together in more pleasant surroundings.

795
1:17:57.35 --> 1:17:59.85
Major Smirnov is on the air.

796
1:18:00.90 --> 1:18:02.44
Give me the walkie-talkie.

797
1:18:02.52 --> 1:18:04.69
Wait a minute. We haven't finished our conversation.

798
1:18:08.36 --> 1:18:11.28
Major

799
1:18:11.37 --> 1:18:15.49
lt's you again

800
1:18:16.54 --> 1:18:18.54
Put me through to Colonel Petrushin.

801
1:18:18.62 --> 1:18:20.29
Obey orders

802
1:18:20.37 --> 1:18:22.58
l have no time to explain anything or put you through.

803
1:18:22.59 --> 1:18:24.67
l am in important negotiations with the criminals.

804
1:18:24.75 --> 1:18:29.01
Negotiations? What can you talk to them about?

805
1:18:29.09 --> 1:18:32.09
They took out three of our guys yesterday.

806
1:18:32.18 --> 1:18:34.85
One of them was my best friend.

807
1:18:34.93 --> 1:18:37.85
- Major

808
1:18:39.56 --> 1:18:43.61
l don't want to pry

809
1:18:44.61 --> 1:18:47.61
Yes. He wants your blood.

810
1:18:49.57 --> 1:18:54.07
l understand him. We'd like to get together with him too.

811
1:18:54.91 --> 1:18:59.33
Verbitskaya

812
1:19:00.08 --> 1:19:03.67
Just tell your negotiating partner that it's all very simple.

813
1:19:04.54 --> 1:19:07.63
He's a criminal and l'll catch him.

814
1:19:08.01 --> 1:19:09.63
And eat him.

815
1:19:11.76 --> 1:19:13.84
- And eat him.  - What did he say?

816
1:19:13.93 --> 1:19:15.64
What does it matter?

817
1:19:15.97 --> 1:19:17.93
What's important is something else.

818
1:19:18.89 --> 1:19:20.60
Your impossible situation.

819
1:19:21.64 --> 1:19:25.23
You must surrender. You're a reasonable person

820
1:19:28.07 --> 1:19:31.82
Surrender

821
1:19:34.82 --> 1:19:36.62
But we have different plans.

822
1:19:40.37 --> 1:19:41.79
What's happened?

823
1:19:42.25 --> 1:19:43.62
Where's he gone?

824
1:19:44.33 --> 1:19:47.04
We haven't finished. He didn't make any demands.

825
1:19:48.00 --> 1:19:50.84
They turned off the computer. Nothing we can do here.

826
1:19:51.92 --> 1:19:54.05
That was cool.

827
1:19:55.18 --> 1:19:58.93
A stylish guy

828
1:19:59.56 --> 1:20:02.93
Great move. Audiences would like him. He'd look great on TV!

829
1:20:03.02 --> 1:20:06.10
What are you saying? What move?

830
1:20:06.19 --> 1:20:10.65
What TV star? He is a criminal

831
1:20:10.73 --> 1:20:12.61
lt is the police who must look great on TV.

832
1:20:12.70 --> 1:20:16.41
- This is what we agreed.  - Sergei Petrovtich

833
1:20:16.49 --> 1:20:19.53
We'll edit this footage exactly how we want.

834
1:20:19.62 --> 1:20:23.25
l beg you. Please find Smirnov's team and remove them from the building.

835
1:20:24.29 --> 1:20:28.59
Use force if you have to. This major is ruining everything for me.

836
1:20:28.67 --> 1:20:31.88
Sir

837
1:20:31.96 --> 1:20:34.01
- What foreigner?  - l'm not sure.

838
1:20:34.09 --> 1:20:36.97
- Either Danish or Swedish. From TV.  - Let them in.

839
1:20:37.05 --> 1:20:42.31
Are you mad? This is operational headquarters.

840
1:20:43.27 --> 1:20:45.56
We cannot let any foreigners in here.

841
1:20:46.48 --> 1:20:48.81
Sergei Petrovitch

842
1:20:48.90 --> 1:20:52.28
Foreigners? l've had enough of this.

843
1:20:59.24 --> 1:21:03.41
OK

844
1:21:03.50 --> 1:21:06.71
Didn't you hear me? What are you doing?

845
1:21:06.79 --> 1:21:10.04
Lie down! Down! Get down!

846
1:21:19.01 --> 1:21:20.05
Major Smirnov?

847
1:21:22.60 --> 1:21:25.18
The infamous Smirnov?

848
1:21:25.56 --> 1:21:29.15
- Yes

849
1:21:31.82 --> 1:21:33.90
ls it true they gave you Japanese food?

850
1:21:33.98 --> 1:21:36.99
Yup. Raw fish. Like the penguins at the zoo.

851
1:21:54.42 --> 1:21:55.76
lt's like this

852
1:21:55.84 --> 1:22:00.26
We all have orders to escort your team out of the building.

853
1:22:01.14 --> 1:22:04.60
l think it'd be better if you left of your own accord.

854
1:22:05.22 --> 1:22:06.77
Do you follow me?

855
1:22:09.31 --> 1:22:10.73
l get it.

856
1:22:11.27 --> 1:22:12.98
l understand.

857
1:22:13.98 --> 1:22:15.61
Thanks.

858
1:22:17.19 --> 1:22:19.36
OK. The show's over.

859
1:22:21.99 --> 1:22:24.12
- Everyone go home.  - Finally!

860
1:22:24.20 --> 1:22:25.79
What else do you think l could do?

861
1:22:26.75 --> 1:22:29.54
Do you know how many there were of them and how many of us?

862
1:22:29.62 --> 1:22:33.04
Can l say something? My husband did nothing wrong.

863
1:22:33.13 --> 1:22:37.84
He can't be blamed for anything. We have two children! They almost killed him!

864
1:22:37.92 --> 1:22:42.43
He should be promoted. Our children are small

865
1:22:42.51 --> 1:22:44.47
she'll be starting her first year at school.

866
1:22:47.22 --> 1:22:49.27
Well

867
1:22:49.64 --> 1:22:52.65
Just eating

868
1:22:53.69 --> 1:22:57.69
We like it here. We're doing fine.

869
1:22:59.19 --> 1:23:02.82
We've got hostages

870
1:23:02.91 --> 1:23:05.95
at the entrance or a helicopter on the roof.

871
1:23:06.03 --> 1:23:07.45
Get real.

872
1:23:07.54 --> 1:23:10.66
When was the last time you ever saw them accept such demands?

873
1:23:10.75 --> 1:23:13.58
They'll just waste us and the hostages too.

874
1:23:13.67 --> 1:23:14.88
And on TV they'll say:

875
1:23:14.96 --> 1:23:18.76
"The final stage of the operation was successfully concluded."

876
1:23:18.84 --> 1:23:21.42
Stay cool

877
1:23:21.51 --> 1:23:24.22
We're going to break out. Where there's life

878
1:23:24.30 --> 1:23:26.60
And if they get us

879
1:23:26.68 --> 1:23:30.64
Destiny decides. ln any case

880
1:23:32.48 --> 1:23:34.81
Break out and go where? What's this about life?

881
1:23:34.90 --> 1:23:38.27
Who's going to get wasted? l've got nothing to do with this!

882
1:23:40.61 --> 1:23:42.28
Why don't you say anything?

883
1:23:45.03 --> 1:23:46.74
l'm listening to you.

884
1:23:53.37 --> 1:23:57.38
Shit your pants

885
1:23:57.96 --> 1:24:01.38
Herman

886
1:24:01.47 --> 1:24:07.30
We need a diversion. Create chaos. And then we'll sort things out.

887
1:24:11.60 --> 1:24:12.77
Hey

888
1:24:14.06 --> 1:24:16.44
- Have you got any blankets?  - Yes

889
1:24:16.52 --> 1:24:19.98
Blankets

890
1:24:20.07 --> 1:24:21.53
Bring them here.

891
1:24:23.57 --> 1:24:26.66
Oleg

892
1:24:26.74 --> 1:24:28.74
Quiet. Everything's OK.

893
1:24:28.83 --> 1:24:32.91
Well

894
1:24:33.00 --> 1:24:36.04
Oh

895
1:24:36.12 --> 1:24:38.54
Oleg

896
1:24:38.63 --> 1:24:41.42
The special forces will get them

897
1:24:41.51 --> 1:24:44.22
We'd all stay

898
1:24:44.30 --> 1:24:46.47
We've chased them into a blind alley. Let the warriors get them.

899
1:24:46.55 --> 1:24:47.72
Why do you have to stay?

900
1:24:47.80 --> 1:24:51.68
Don't know. Watch them being caught. Might be helpful

901
1:24:51.77 --> 1:24:53.47
- You know...  - What?

902
1:24:54.27 --> 1:24:55.43
lt's an order.

903
1:24:56.48 --> 1:24:58.56
This time it's mine. So follow it

904
1:25:04.32 --> 1:25:05.49
Thanks.

905
1:25:08.41 --> 1:25:11.53
Go now

906
1:25:55.33 --> 1:25:56.37
What did he say?

907
1:25:57.46 --> 1:25:59.71
He says that our show is very good.

908
1:25:59.79 --> 1:26:02.59
He wants to buy the worldwide rights to produce it.

909
1:26:02.67 --> 1:26:06.92
His opening offer is 50

910
1:26:07.01 --> 1:26:09.26
Plus a percentage from international licensing.

911
1:26:09.34 --> 1:26:12.97
We need to think about it. We're likely to receive more offers like this.

912
1:26:13.06 --> 1:26:15.81
Especially when the evening ratings come in.

913
1:26:17.02 --> 1:26:19.31
Translate: "This isn't a market."

914
1:26:37.16 --> 1:26:39.66
The situation hasn't changed in the last hour.

915
1:26:39.75 --> 1:26:44.54
As a police representative said: "lt's the waiting stage of the operation."

916
1:26:44.63 --> 1:26:50.80
They are trying to make contact and get them to release the hostages.

917
1:27:00.02 --> 1:27:02.10
- Turn off your camera!  - Put your hands up!

918
1:27:15.95 --> 1:27:20.91
They've probably used the grenade launcher again! This is a live broadcast.

919
1:27:21.00 --> 1:27:22.42
ls this your show?

920
1:27:23.08 --> 1:27:25.75
ls this what you wanted to show the entire country?

921
1:27:27.38 --> 1:27:29.67
You have disgraced me!

922
1:27:29.76 --> 1:27:32.17
Wait

923
1:27:32.26 --> 1:27:36.89
- The new footage is nearly finished.  - Show? What bloody show?

924
1:27:36.97 --> 1:27:40.56
Don't you understand anything? People are dying here!

925
1:27:40.64 --> 1:27:43.35
You're relieved of command. Colonel!

926
1:27:44.06 --> 1:27:47.15
What are these civilians doing here?

927
1:27:47.23 --> 1:27:49.11
Disperse them to a safe distance. Clear?

928
1:27:49.19 --> 1:27:52.07
Begin the assault on the apartment. At the double! Carry on!

929
1:27:52.15 --> 1:27:53.70
- Yes

930
1:28:17.35 --> 1:28:20.26
Stop! They've got grenades.

931
1:28:21.56 --> 1:28:23.35
Five and Seven

932
1:28:23.44 --> 1:28:27.40
A second group is coming out. Withdraw! Withdraw!

933
1:28:27.48 --> 1:28:29.44
Calmly

934
1:28:29.52 --> 1:28:34.61
This might be the hostages. Withdraw! Withdraw!

935
1:28:37.99 --> 1:28:42.16
Don't let them go. Come on! Come on!

936
1:28:46.37 --> 1:28:48.29
They're entering the lift.

937
1:28:48.38 --> 1:28:51.50
Careful

938
1:28:51.59 --> 1:28:53.67
We'll take them down the stairs.

939
1:29:00.60 --> 1:29:03.47
Check the left-hand lift! There's somebody inside it!

940
1:29:15.07 --> 1:29:16.32
Grenade!

941
1:29:22.29 --> 1:29:23.87
Anyone down?

942
1:29:24.79 --> 1:29:25.87
l'm a hostage!

943
1:30:11.59 --> 1:30:12.84
Take him away!

944
1:30:15.09 --> 1:30:16.80
ln a hurry?

945
1:30:19.93 --> 1:30:22.55
l'm used to finishing what l set out to do.

946
1:30:24.39 --> 1:30:25.43
Admirable.

947
1:30:27.93 --> 1:30:29.60
My reputation has no price.

948
1:30:36.36 --> 1:30:38.69
Everyone withdraw! Withdraw!

949
1:30:39.99 --> 1:30:45.20
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! We're hostages!

950
1:30:49.54 --> 1:30:51.33
l'm a hostage!

951
1:33:03.88 --> 1:33:07.18
You're listening to Radio Mayak. Life goes on!

952
1:33:07.26 --> 1:33:12.89
Life goes on and so does our report from North Chertanovo.

953
1:33:12.97 --> 1:33:16.85
The rescue of the hostages is under way and is being videotaped

954
1:33:16.94 --> 1:33:19.19
so you can follow it on TV.

955
1:33:19.27 --> 1:33:22.11
You have all this technology

956
1:33:22.19 --> 1:33:24.69
Katya

957
1:33:24.78 --> 1:33:28.45
All the criminals were caught or killed. All the hostages survived.

958
1:33:33.29 --> 1:33:37.25
- Stand back! Stand back!  - Please

959
1:33:49.76 --> 1:33:52.68
Two bodies at the top. One in the basement!

960
1:33:52.76 --> 1:33:55.52
Two captured. One missing.

961
1:34:16.87 --> 1:34:18.04
ls it you

962
1:34:19.12 --> 1:34:22.04
Tired of running away from my boys? Come out for a breather?

963
1:34:22.13 --> 1:34:25.21
There'll be plenty of time for that at the inquiry!

964
1:34:25.30 --> 1:34:28.22
That's it

965
1:34:28.30 --> 1:34:31.01
The findings of the official review will be passed to the prosecutor.

966
1:34:31.09 --> 1:34:32.64
Your fate is now in his hands!

967
1:34:33.51 --> 1:34:35.47
Don't even contact me!

968
1:34:35.56 --> 1:34:37.22
l've had enough of you now!

969
1:34:37.31 --> 1:34:40.19
You know what l think of you. l'm talking to you! Always playing the hero.

970
1:36:26.63 --> 1:36:28.25
- Drive!  - Where to?

971
1:36:28.34 --> 1:36:30.55
Straight ahead!

972
1:36:41.85 --> 1:36:43.39
Stop! Stop!

973
1:36:45.98 --> 1:36:49.44
- Help!  - Sorry

974
1:36:50.98 --> 1:36:53.15
You bastard! Arsehole!

975
1:37:17.30 --> 1:37:20.01
You're even more beautiful in real life than on TV.

976
1:37:22.93 --> 1:37:24.98
Your boyfriend's one lucky guy.

977
1:37:26.14 --> 1:37:27.73
l haven't got a boyfriend.

978
1:37:31.02 --> 1:37:33.57
And your girlfriend is really out of luck.

979
1:37:35.45 --> 1:37:38.41
Today will end very badly for you.

980
1:37:39.87 --> 1:37:41.37
l'm single too.

981
1:37:47.04 --> 1:37:48.33
Oh

982
1:37:57.72 --> 1:37:59.64
He's a really brave cop.

983
1:38:00.68 --> 1:38:01.72
He's an idiot!

984
1:38:01.80 --> 1:38:03.22
l value courage in people.

985
1:38:04.35 --> 1:38:07.02
You should value brains instead.

986
1:38:07.10 --> 1:38:09.27
Are you still hoping to escape after all?

987
1:38:10.36 --> 1:38:13.61
Don't get your hopes up

988
1:38:16.69 --> 1:38:18.70
ls that how you drive?

989
1:38:18.78 --> 1:38:21.99
Didn't you see the sign there? l should call the traffic police.

990
1:39:22.84 --> 1:39:24.51
Sit down.

991
1:39:30.31 --> 1:39:32.02
That's better!

992
1:39:51.16 --> 1:39:52.71
Where are we going?

993
1:39:53.75 --> 1:39:56.79
Why don't you give yourself up?

994
1:39:57.38 --> 1:40:00.09
lt'd be better for both of us.

995
1:40:01.80 --> 1:40:05.97
The show's been over a long time. They'll just shoot you now.

996
1:40:06.05 --> 1:40:07.43
Show

997
1:40:07.51 --> 1:40:09.77
So

998
1:40:10.35 --> 1:40:12.14
Does the bad guy get killed in the end?

999
1:40:12.89 --> 1:40:15.52
- And who did you play?  - The director.

1000
1:40:15.61 --> 1:40:18.02
So why didn't anyone let me read the script?

1001
1:40:25.99 --> 1:40:27.62
A show?

1002
1:40:27.70 --> 1:40:30.62
A show dedicated to those who finish their work.

1003
1:42:09.72 --> 1:42:12.93
Before you start asking questions

1004
1:42:13.01 --> 1:42:16.47
and we try to answer them as frankly as we can

1005
1:42:16.56 --> 1:42:18.89
l would like to make the following statement:

1006
1:42:18.98 --> 1:42:22.81
The success of this operation was

1007
1:42:24.03 --> 1:42:27.69
well-prepared and highly professional actions.

1008
1:42:28.61 --> 1:42:31.07
First of all

1009
1:42:31.16 --> 1:42:36.04
Major Smirnov and Captain Verbitskaya.

1010
1:42:40.88 --> 1:42:47.26
The success of the operation was also thanks to thorough planning

1011
1:42:47.34 --> 1:42:53.05
and competent coordination on the part of all units

1012
1:42:54.64 --> 1:42:59.52
practised to perfection many times during training exercises.

1013
1:42:59.60 --> 1:43:04.69
That was all l had to say. And now

1014
1:44:44.96 --> 1:44:47.96
As a result of the operation four criminals were killed

1015
1:44:48.04 --> 1:44:51.67
two were arrested. Police found their arsenal:

1016
1:44:51.67 --> 1:44:54.92
four automatic guns

1017
1:44:55.01 --> 1:44:57.68
a grenade launcher and seven grenades.

1018
1:44:57.76 --> 1:45:00.35
The victims are receiving help from psychologists.

1019
1:45:00.43 --> 1:45:04.02
Captain Verbitskaya

1020
0:01:51.62 --> 0:01:54.75
买礼物送给你妻子吧

1021
0:02:03.55 --> 0:02:06.68
它们可能看起来不好看 但闻起来特别香

1022
0:02:18.19 --> 0:02:22.24
天气很好，不是吗？ 请买些花吧

1023
0:02:22.32 --> 0:02:25.45
像这样的好天气，人本应该都有束花 你要买花吗？

1024
0:02:26.45 --> 0:02:29.70
可以讲价的。拜托你了 我在这里已经3小时都没有卖出去了

1025
0:02:29.79 --> 0:02:32.37
买去送给你的女朋友吧！ 我还没有女朋友

1026
0:02:32.46 --> 0:02:38.25
好，那也不是不幸 那就送给男朋友高兴高兴吧

1027
0:02:40.80 --> 0:02:42.76
可能迟点你会要，嘿嘿

1028
0:02:44.26 --> 0:02:46.01
如果你改变主意的话我还在这儿

1029
0:02:48.64 --> 0:02:53.77
卡卢加，你收到了吗？我是坦波夫 卡卢加收到

1030
0:02:53.85 --> 0:02:56.19
另一个人出现了 大家注意

1031
0:03:54.16 --> 0:03:55.62
赫尔曼，是时候了

1032
0:03:57.00 --> 0:03:59.08
出发。克利，去拿车

1033
0:04:11.56 --> 0:04:16.60
嘿，先生，看一下这些花吧！ 买去送给女朋友

1034
0:04:16.69 --> 0:04:20.10
我没有女孩送。还是送给米哈利奇吧 他今天情绪不佳

1035
0:04:20.19 --> 0:04:24.48
不用担心米哈利奇 你很快会有女朋友的

1036
0:04:24.57 --> 0:04:27.78
- 你忘了？      - 什么？

1037
0:04:27.86 --> 0:04:30.78
你需要的是提高智商 而不是抓住罪犯

1038
0:04:30.87 --> 0:04:33.58
明天，我带你去见我的新邻居丽莎

1039
0:04:35.08 --> 0:04:38.87
想象一下吧，米哈利奇 我就去给他找马子了

1040
0:04:38.96 --> 0:04:42.04
安德雷，明天再告诉我们这些事 现在回到你的位置上去

1041
0:04:42.13 --> 0:04:43.75
准备好，明天你…

1042
0:04:43.84 --> 0:04:45.17
滚开！

1043
0:04:45.26 --> 0:04:47.97
神经病！

1044
0:04:51.55 --> 0:04:54.14
我的胃还在痛

1045
0:05:03.27 --> 0:05:08.28
卡卢加，我是坦波夫，你收到了吗？ 收到，坦波夫

1046
0:05:08.36 --> 0:05:09.86
他们正在取车

1047
0:05:11.53 --> 0:05:15.24
需要花吗？新鲜的！乡下的！

1048
0:05:15.33 --> 0:05:16.58
准备行动

1049
0:05:18.71 --> 0:05:20.92
看看这花！多么雪白！

1050
0:05:24.46 --> 0:05:27.09
这里发生什么事了？

1051
0:05:28.63 --> 0:05:30.67
这些冒失鬼从哪过来的？

1052
0:05:32.01 --> 0:05:34.22
交警要在这里干什么？

1053
0:05:34.30 --> 0:05:40.02
许多人开车走错了路 为躲开阻塞的交通开到单行道上

1054
0:05:40.10 --> 0:05:41.48
不用担心，老大

1055
0:05:41.56 --> 0:05:44.86
他们不同我们，要认真对待这些

1056
0:05:44.94 --> 0:05:47.15
他们会抢了钱后离开

1057
0:05:52.70 --> 0:05:56.24
交警中心大尉哲亚兹尼科夫

1058
0:05:58.16 --> 0:05:59.25
嗨

1059
0:06:00.41 --> 0:06:03.46
你们为什么停在这？地方不够吗？

1060
0:06:03.54 --> 0:06:06.25
对不起警官，就停一会儿

1061
0:06:06.92 --> 0:06:10.09
我们要装一些东西 我们有个很重的包裹

1062
0:06:11.42 --> 0:06:12.63
我们准备要走了

1063
0:06:13.39 --> 0:06:17.10
和包裹有什么关系？ 这是单行道

1064
0:06:17.18 --> 0:06:21.35
那个标志你没有看到？ 你逆行了

1065
0:06:33.57 --> 0:06:35.41
什么事情搞得这么长时间？

1066
0:06:36.45 --> 0:06:38.58
卡卢加，我是坦波夫，你收到了吗？

1067
0:06:39.45 --> 0:06:43.79
我们有个麻烦 两个伙计正在盘问我们的目标

1068
0:06:43.87 --> 0:06:47.33
弄走他们！敖德萨，去！

1069
0:06:47.96 --> 0:06:52.38
警官，我告诉你我没看见这个标志 是我的错

1070
0:06:52.47 --> 0:06:56.30
听到了吗？没看到… 那你们现在要去干啥？

1071
0:06:57.22 --> 0:06:59.14
我不喜欢他们

1072
0:06:59.22 --> 0:07:02.43
我们可以现在离开这里吗？ 我不喜欢他们

1073
0:07:03.06 --> 0:07:07.77
你不需要喜欢我们 检查我的驾照吧

1074
0:07:09.11 --> 0:07:10.82
也许你们会喜欢

1075
0:07:15.91 --> 0:07:18.45
口头警告，好吗？

1076
0:07:19.33 --> 0:07:21.54
没事了，坦波夫，他们已经搞定了

1077
0:07:30.00 --> 0:07:31.21
好，那么再见！

1078
0:07:32.30 --> 0:07:33.80
你的包裹是什么？

1079
0:07:35.18 --> 0:07:37.51
拿出来打开检查

1080
0:07:47.77 --> 0:07:50.81
中心请回答！中心请回答！ 我是坦波夫

1081
0:08:07.33 --> 0:08:11.84
派救援和医护人员来，情况紧急！ 听到了吗？现在！

1082
0:08:24.18 --> 0:08:26.18
快！

1083
0:10:23.30 --> 0:10:25.30
快！快！快！

1084
0:10:41.53 --> 0:10:43.20
掩护我！

1085
0:11:02.92 --> 0:11:05.01
进车里！快！

1086
0:11:33.71 --> 0:11:35.79
戈恩！上！

1087
0:11:38.50 --> 0:11:41.13
榴弹！卧倒！

1088
0:12:03.53 --> 0:12:05.69
他们正在离开！

1089
0:12:18.96 --> 0:12:20.67
不要叫！

1090
0:13:05.96 --> 0:13:10.13
小心开车，笨蛋！ 你们要去哪里？

1091
0:13:29.65 --> 0:13:32.86
伙计，他们在那里！ 空的？

1092
0:13:51.55 --> 0:13:54.47
阿克辛娅

1093
0:13:54.55 --> 0:13:58.27
这件事是谁的错？ 请不要拍！

1094
0:14:00.77 --> 0:14:02.69
她的驾照大概是买的

1095
0:14:17.79 --> 0:14:20.20
爸爸，爸爸！ 那些家伙有自动步枪！

1096
0:14:20.87 --> 0:14:22.91
好车。是一辆自动档的车

1097
0:14:23.96 --> 0:14:27.59
家伙？这是那位女士的车

1098
0:15:04.79 --> 0:15:05.87
出来！

1099
0:15:34.90 --> 0:15:36.11
赫尔曼，快！

1100
0:15:40.79 --> 0:15:43.08
进救护车里！

1101
0:16:04.10 --> 0:16:05.39
奥尔达，掩护我！

1102
0:16:22.20 --> 0:16:23.62
快！

1103
0:16:39.01 --> 0:16:40.43
这救护车要去哪里？

1104
0:16:45.60 --> 0:16:47.56
上帝…

1105
0:16:48.06 --> 0:16:49.90
他差点杀了我

1106
0:16:51.52 --> 0:16:53.94
他瞄准了我的脸

1107
0:16:55.57 --> 0:16:57.15
我不想死！

1108
0:16:59.24 --> 0:17:01.82
我有家庭

1109
0:17:01.82 --> 0:17:05.66
不要，不要拍。停！

1110
0:17:05.75 --> 0:17:10.75
今天早晨，莫斯科中心一条 安静的街道成为了战场

1111
0:17:10.83 --> 0:17:13.75
“突破新闻”在现场报道 著名歌手阿克辛娅

1112
0:17:13.84 --> 0:17:16.59
一起交通事故时 目击了一场枪战…

1113
0:17:16.67 --> 0:17:18.63
博尔德列夫将军命令

1114
0:17:18.72 --> 0:17:23.05
通知所有部门的头 和特别行动组的指挥官

1115
0:17:23.14 --> 0:17:26.26
来我的办公室开会，马上

1116
0:17:26.85 --> 0:17:28.98
这次枪战将无辜的民众处于危险当中

1117
0:17:29.06 --> 0:17:32.60
而且匪徒就和平常一样 设法逃了出去

1118
0:17:32.69 --> 0:17:39.19
现在流行音乐歌手阿克辛娅作为个目击者 报道这些难以置信的事件

1119
0:17:39.28 --> 0:17:45.49
在这条人与汽车拥挤的街道 警方与5名武装分子撞到了一起

1120
0:17:45.58 --> 0:17:49.50
枪战使人们处于危险当中

1121
0:17:49.58 --> 0:17:51.87
其中包括著名的流行歌星阿克辛娅

1122
0:17:51.87 --> 0:17:53.79
请告诉我们，您害怕吗？

1123
0:17:53.88 --> 0:17:58.13
这确实骇人听闻！太不可思议了

1124
0:17:58.13 --> 0:18:02.47
他们到处跑来跑去，相互射击

1125
0:18:02.55 --> 0:18:05.93
还有手榴弹！ 就像一场真正的战争

1126
0:18:06.01 --> 0:18:10.31
以下是我们的摄影师 在现场拍到的一些画面

1127
0:18:10.81 --> 0:18:14.86
包括有两名无辜的群众和警察 死于这场火拼

1128
0:18:14.94 --> 0:18:18.98
根据警方报道，这个团伙 参与持枪抢劫与偷窃

1129
0:18:19.07 --> 0:18:21.74
调查还在继续 他们的名字未被透露

1130
0:18:21.82 --> 0:18:28.37
这简直难以置信！ 这是第一次有个警察在电视上哭。

1131
0:18:28.37 --> 0:18:30.58
你知道，这还不是最糟糕的

1132
0:18:30.66 --> 0:18:33.71
我的任务是消除警察的图像

1133
0:18:34.71 --> 0:18:37.04
无论如何没有人会相信这些的 他们还是英雄

1134
0:18:37.13 --> 0:18:41.17
他们不能和正常人 一样的表现

1135
0:18:41.26 --> 0:18:44.22
对于任何媒体来说丑闻总是好新闻

1136
0:18:44.30 --> 0:18:46.97
好，亲爱的，我要走了 我准备迟点开个会

1137
0:18:47.56 --> 0:18:50.97
我希望他们给我一个闪光灯 那么我就可以避开堵塞的交通

1138
0:18:51.06 --> 0:18:54.69
小姐，结账。 再见了

1139
0:19:09.87 --> 0:19:13.00
我没有完成任务！ 别担心，会没事的

1140
0:19:15.63 --> 0:19:18.84
我在工作，就这样了 对不起，再见

1141
0:19:23.34 --> 0:19:26.93
这意味着我们的城市处于失控状态

1142
0:19:27.55 --> 0:19:30.10
如果甚至警察都怕走街道

1143
0:19:30.18 --> 0:19:32.72
那么像你和我这样的平民会怎样？

1144
0:19:32.81 --> 0:19:35.19
我们被迫面对一个令人不快的事实

1145
0:19:36.48 --> 0:19:41.44
莫斯科警方无法 挽救当前的局面

1146
0:19:41.53 --> 0:19:48.24
法治腐败自上而下

1147
0:19:48.32 --> 0:19:53.50
如果这个腐败、无能的机构

1148
0:19:53.58 --> 0:19:55.41
不能保护我们的城市

1149
0:19:55.50 --> 0:20:00.34
那么我们要学会自我保护

1150
0:20:00.42 --> 0:20:03.76
我一直推动对小型武器的自由买卖

1151
0:20:03.84 --> 0:20:05.84
现在机会来了

1152
0:20:07.97 --> 0:20:11.35
够了？难道还要给我们 看到更多这些吗？

1153
0:20:13.85 --> 0:20:15.56
我们能说些什么？

1154
0:20:20.90 --> 0:20:25.11
当有线索时我们启动“拦截”计划

1155
0:20:26.32 --> 0:20:29.95
遗憾的是并没有达到效果

1156
0:20:30.03 --> 0:20:33.16
所以“飓风”计划已经开始

1157
0:20:33.24 --> 0:20:38.21
军队现已处于全面戒备状态

1158
0:20:38.29 --> 0:20:41.71
我们刚刚收到的第一份报告

1159
0:20:41.79 --> 0:20:48.76
11辆报失车已经找到

1160
0:20:48.84 --> 0:20:53.26
9个通缉犯已被逮捕

1161
0:20:53.93 --> 0:21:00.31
7支枪和12把刀被没收

1162
0:21:00.40 --> 0:21:03.86
以及两公斤毒品...

1163
0:21:03.94 --> 0:21:05.40
什么？

1164
0:21:05.48 --> 0:21:07.19
你在说什么？

1165
0:21:08.74 --> 0:21:12.07
两公斤毒品...

1166
0:21:12.07 --> 0:21:14.24
你不懂发生了什么吗？

1167
0:21:14.33 --> 0:21:16.87
手榴弹在街上爆炸！

1168
0:21:18.87 --> 0:21:22.46
而不是其他地方，是在市中心 几乎是在克里姆林宫的门口！

1169
0:21:24.00 --> 0:21:28.97
电视新闻整天在播出 莫斯科一名警员在枪口下哭

1170
0:21:32.55 --> 0:21:35.72
总统办公室已经两次打电话给我

1171
0:21:36.52 --> 0:21:39.77
而我们有什么表现呢？7把刀？

1172
0:21:39.77 --> 0:21:40.77
是12把

1173
0:21:42.10 --> 0:21:47.57
12把刀和7支枪

1174
0:21:47.65 --> 0:21:51.57
难道你没看到这些混蛋 已经向我们宣战了？

1175
0:21:54.28 --> 0:21:57.95
而我们现在都未见起色。坐下

1176
0:22:03.08 --> 0:22:08.96
谢尔盖.彼得罗维奇，我们 对这样的情况有标准程序

1177
0:22:10.09 --> 0:22:11.93
我们必须等他们给出结果

1178
0:22:12.01 --> 0:22:15.47
我们生活在日本？

1179
0:22:17.14 --> 0:22:21.27
他们对武装抢劫的破案率是76％

1180
0:22:21.35 --> 0:22:24.02
这又是什么？我该提醒你吗？

1181
0:22:24.11 --> 0:22:27.65
您的标准措施通常没有什么效果

1182
0:22:30.28 --> 0:22:31.78
在一场战争中没有用

1183
0:22:32.36 --> 0:22:34.86
不需要很激烈。什么是战争？

1184
0:22:35.62 --> 0:22:37.91
他们不是恐怖分子 他们都是罪犯

1185
0:22:37.99 --> 0:22:44.33
真的吗？你还有什么有趣的事 能告诉我们，彼得鲁上校？

1186
0:22:44.42 --> 0:22:45.58
可悲的是，不多

1187
0:22:46.34 --> 0:22:48.00
我们有理由相信这一团伙

1188
0:22:48.09 --> 0:22:51.59
在各个地区

1189
0:22:51.67 --> 0:22:54.18
持械行劫银行押款车

1190
0:22:54.26 --> 0:22:57.18
他们似乎每隔几个月才行动一次

1191
0:22:57.26 --> 0:23:00.93
他们所有的行动计划非常详细 执行也无懈可击

1192
0:23:01.02 --> 0:23:03.23
到目前为止，他们还没有犯错

1193
0:23:03.31 --> 0:23:05.48
斯米尔诺夫已追踪了他们两年

1194
0:23:05.56 --> 0:23:07.86
但迄今为止，仍无法抓获他们

1195
0:23:07.94 --> 0:23:12.90
昨天我们收到消息 可能是这个团伙的藏身之处

1196
0:23:12.99 --> 0:23:14.65
其余的，你现在都知道了

1197
0:23:14.74 --> 0:23:17.62
我们迟早会抓住他们

1198
0:23:18.49 --> 0:23:21.95
到时候媒体的影响会逐步消失

1199
0:23:22.62 --> 0:23:24.12
这种事以前发生了很多次

1200
0:23:26.83 --> 0:23:31.80
好，我明白了 还有其他什么建议吗？

1201
0:23:35.01 --> 0:23:41.22
让我们来听一下我们的公关主任 狗仔队马上就去她的街道

1202
0:23:41.31 --> 0:23:44.31
瓦碧茨卡佳上尉，你有什么想法？

1203
0:23:45.06 --> 0:23:48.65
我同意谢尔盖.彼得罗维奇的看法 他们是在向我们宣战

1204
0:23:49.94 --> 0:23:54.90
因此，只是抓住歹徒或击毙他们 并将这些向新闻界展现

1205
0:23:54.99 --> 0:24:00.78
并不足以消除这些灾难影响

1206
0:24:00.87 --> 0:24:04.12
我们必须虚拟播出

1207
0:24:04.91 --> 0:24:07.12
在同一战场上击败他们

1208
0:24:07.71 --> 0:24:09.21
具体怎么做？

1209
0:24:09.29 --> 0:24:14.01
我们需要证明这个危险 的团伙已被抓获

1210
0:24:15.59 --> 0:24:17.38
一场真人秀！

1211
0:24:17.47 --> 0:24:20.80
展现莫斯科警察的勇气和专业技能

1212
0:24:20.89 --> 0:24:24.85
以及开放和人性话的执法当局

1213
0:24:26.10 --> 0:24:31.44
这个节目将成为世界首播

1214
0:24:31.52 --> 0:24:38.45
试想一下，在所有主要电视频道 播出了警方的武装行动

1215
0:24:38.53 --> 0:24:43.08
还有互联网，利用所有最新的多媒体技术

1216
0:24:43.16 --> 0:24:47.37
我们失败的一天一定会变成胜利！

1217
0:24:55.67 --> 0:24:57.72
这是一个有趣的想法

1218
0:24:58.76 --> 0:25:01.47
但是做到这些，我们必须 首先要找到他们

1219
0:25:01.55 --> 0:25:03.14
没错

1220
0:25:03.72 --> 0:25:06.02
你替我找他们

1221
0:25:07.85 --> 0:25:10.19
我会准备好一切的

1222
0:25:11.27 --> 0:25:14.48
谢尔盖.彼得罗维奇，您叫我？ 进来，卡佳，进来

1223
0:25:16.86 --> 0:25:18.90
新闻稿准备好了吗？

1224
0:25:20.24 --> 0:25:23.16
刚刚完成。我在半小时内拿来给您审批

1225
0:25:26.62 --> 0:25:28.83
谢尔盖.彼得罗维奇

1226
0:25:28.91 --> 0:25:31.62
谢谢你对我的支持

1227
0:25:31.71 --> 0:25:33.25
卡佳

1228
0:25:34.34 --> 0:25:36.92
你也知道发生了什么？

1229
0:25:37.80 --> 0:25:41.38
所有电视台都报道，所有的这些声音？

1230
0:25:42.09 --> 0:25:44.97
一些糊涂的警员举手投降

1231
0:25:45.85 --> 0:25:48.18
我的上帝，他还能做什么？ 他应该去死！

1232
0:25:49.18 --> 0:25:50.64
这只是一个借口

1233
0:25:50.73 --> 0:25:52.52
你以为我没有敌人了吗？

1234
0:25:54.02 --> 0:25:56.44
这一切都是政治！

1235
0:25:59.28 --> 0:26:02.11
如果你现在知道我 是多么想念你的父亲

1236
0:26:03.24 --> 0:26:04.70
他是多么机灵！

1237
0:26:04.78 --> 0:26:05.99
我希望你效仿他

1238
0:26:06.08 --> 0:26:09.45
先生，给我机会我会证明给您看的

1239
0:26:10.41 --> 0:26:11.71
好，去吧

1240
0:26:11.79 --> 0:26:15.04
你这个建议以前从没有做过

1241
0:26:17.17 --> 0:26:20.55
但在目前情况下可能 是唯一正确的解决方案

1242
0:26:20.63 --> 0:26:22.22
不是成功就是失败

1243
0:26:23.39 --> 0:26:26.43
我已经做了一切必要的安排

1244
0:26:26.51 --> 0:26:32.60
你有广泛的权力和资源 以及我个人的支持

1245
0:26:33.65 --> 0:26:37.40
但你不要让我失望

1246
0:26:39.69 --> 0:26:42.65
你知道会有什么后果？

1247
0:26:42.74 --> 0:26:47.62
先生，如果没有人碍手碍脚 我们会完成任务的。

1248
0:26:48.54 --> 0:26:50.04
我不会让您失望

1249
0:26:59.30 --> 0:27:01.59
哈姆雷特，帮我一下！

1250
0:27:04.30 --> 0:27:07.43
又是热狗！三亚，这是你的

1251
0:27:13.69 --> 0:27:14.77
谢谢

1252
0:27:15.48 --> 0:27:18.06
其实，我不该吃这些。 我胃不好

1253
0:27:23.70 --> 0:27:26.07
你在看什么？欣赏风景？

1254
0:27:26.16 --> 0:27:27.62
这里有什么欣赏的？

1255
0:27:29.16 --> 0:27:30.58
这不是一个城市，是一个垃圾场

1256
0:27:31.16 --> 0:27:33.00
奥列格，你需要去结婚

1257
0:27:33.08 --> 0:27:36.21
否则，你会经常看到到处都是垃圾堆

1258
0:27:36.29 --> 0:27:37.96
为什么要结婚？

1259
0:27:38.04 --> 0:27:43.51
我读过，莫斯科在世界上污染 最严重的城市中排第14位

1260
0:27:44.13 --> 0:27:46.05
当然巴库是排第一

1261
0:27:46.14 --> 0:27:48.01
奥列格，我们收到料了

1262
0:27:48.10 --> 0:27:49.76
沃彻克已经找到了

1263
0:27:52.14 --> 0:27:53.27
我们走吧

1264
0:28:00.57 --> 0:28:02.69
嗯，敬谢尔盖的灵魂

1265
0:28:03.28 --> 0:28:05.57
拿着枪，死得其所

1266
0:28:07.07 --> 0:28:09.57
如果他是一个海盗 他将去瓦尔哈拉

1267
0:28:20.88 --> 0:28:22.21
我们要做什么？

1268
0:28:22.30 --> 0:28:25.67
躲藏了一两天了，然后分开？  - 分开？

1269
0:28:27.63 --> 0:28:29.26
那么为什么我们要在一起？

1270
0:28:29.64 --> 0:28:31.60
我们为什么要放弃自己的生意？

1271
0:28:31.68 --> 0:28:34.68
我们少了一个人 所以我们只有改变计划！

1272
0:28:34.77 --> 0:28:36.18
你怎么想，赫尔曼？

1273
0:28:39.98 --> 0:28:41.73
我们要离开这里

1274
0:28:42.61 --> 0:28:45.86
一定是有人通风报信给警察了 这个地方可能不安全了

1275
0:28:45.94 --> 0:28:47.53
是啊，但有地方去吗？

1276
0:28:48.74 --> 0:28:49.91
总是有的

1277
0:28:54.12 --> 0:28:56.08
嗯，在切尔塔诺夫还有一个地方

1278
0:28:56.16 --> 0:29:00.50
有一次，我带了一些大麻给红头家伙 一个非常谨慎的人

1279
0:29:00.58 --> 0:29:03.79
他迷上了个妓女，他们会抽一下大麻

1280
0:29:03.88 --> 0:29:07.09
所以他们要送货上门 就像送比萨饼一样，你明白吗？

1281
0:29:07.17 --> 0:29:08.22
地址是什么？

1282
0:29:08.30 --> 0:29:10.97
什么地址？我一生只去过一次！

1283
0:29:14.81 --> 0:29:17.18
那我们走吧。  - 去哪里？

1284
0:29:17.27 --> 0:29:19.60
去切尔塔诺夫，我在那儿工作

1285
0:29:19.69 --> 0:29:22.52
什么工作？欠揍…

1286
0:29:25.53 --> 0:29:26.65
几楼？

1287
0:29:26.74 --> 0:29:30.32
不是四楼就是五楼 有个讨厌的门

1288
0:29:33.53 --> 0:29:35.70
来吧，沃彻克，你指给我们看 不行

1289
0:29:37.66 --> 0:29:38.75
咋的啦？

1290
0:29:39.16 --> 0:29:42.83
这不是交易的一部分，少校 上次我已经不欠你了

1291
0:29:42.92 --> 0:29:45.46
他们给你留下纰漏 这一次，他们就会杀了我

1292
0:29:45.55 --> 0:29:48.42
他们当然会。这就是你的命运

1293
0:29:48.63 --> 0:29:50.22
不，我不去了

1294
0:29:51.18 --> 0:29:54.05
你不去，你这龟儿子？ 他们今天杀了安德烈！

1295
0:29:54.14 --> 0:29:55.51
我会亲自杀了你！

1296
0:30:00.81 --> 0:30:02.31
什么毛病

1297
0:30:05.27 --> 0:30:07.07
好

1298
0:30:07.78 --> 0:30:10.36
冷静。冷静。

1299
0:30:12.36 --> 0:30:14.03
我们在开玩笑，行了吧？

1300
0:30:18.95 --> 0:30:20.87
是那个门。   - 你确定？

1301
0:30:20.96 --> 0:30:22.21
肯定是

1302
0:30:41.56 --> 0:30:48.48
女士们先生们，欢迎来到 第一青少年广播电台

1303
0:30:50.57 --> 0:30:52.11
我们正在这里开一个聚会

1304
0:30:58.29 --> 0:30:59.83
来迟了

1305
0:31:11.92 --> 0:31:14.84
现在怎么办？回家睡觉？

1306
0:31:15.39 --> 0:31:17.68
不，我们在这里开车兜几圈

1307
0:31:18.31 --> 0:31:21.47
整个城市都在找他们 他们很难走多远

1308
0:31:22.73 --> 0:31:24.35
他们在这里的某个地方

1309
0:31:27.11 --> 0:31:28.11
我的直觉告诉我

1310
0:31:28.19 --> 0:31:30.57
那不是你的直觉，是胃痉挛

1311
0:31:30.65 --> 0:31:32.44
那从我的地方开始

1312
0:31:36.24 --> 0:31:38.82
那要叫物证科过来吗？

1313
0:31:42.08 --> 0:31:45.21
你知道对方是谁吗？是什么身份？

1314
0:31:45.92 --> 0:31:49.71
好吧，亲爱的 如果你需要，我会打电话给你。

1315
0:31:53.72 --> 0:31:55.09
你看，这样行吗？

1316
0:31:56.59 --> 0:31:57.84
你是个天才！

1317
0:32:17.95 --> 0:32:21.03
他们往那边走了。在那里

1318
0:32:27.08 --> 0:32:28.58
请出示你的证件！

1319
0:32:30.42 --> 0:32:32.55
我们的警察正在努力工作，不是吗？

1320
0:32:32.63 --> 0:32:34.13
虽然有点无礼

1321
0:32:55.61 --> 0:32:56.94
立正！

1322
0:32:56.95 --> 0:32:59.20
稍息！稍息！

1323
0:32:59.28 --> 0:33:01.03
特种部队！

1324
0:33:01.12 --> 0:33:07.08
我们的任务是消灭 一个危险的犯罪团伙

1325
0:33:08.00 --> 0:33:12.59
我们也有义务为我们昨天的同志报仇

1326
0:33:12.67 --> 0:33:14.80
让他们记住我们

1327
0:33:15.71 --> 0:33:20.63
博尔德列夫中将将亲自指挥

1328
0:33:21.72 --> 0:33:26.31
这些区别意味着将有奖赏

1329
0:33:26.39 --> 0:33:30.19
但搞砸了也会得到惩罚

1330
0:33:30.27 --> 0:33:35.27
现在，行动副指挥官瓦碧茨卡佳上尉

1331
0:33:35.36 --> 0:33:38.44
将解释一些技术细节

1332
0:33:41.20 --> 0:33:42.28
战士们！

1333
0:33:43.78 --> 0:33:48.66
你们今天不只是特种部队

1334
0:33:49.58 --> 0:33:54.04
还是这个独特媒体项目的参与者

1335
0:33:54.71 --> 0:33:59.26
你们都将配发微型摄像机

1336
0:33:59.34 --> 0:34:02.43
将加到你们的头盔里固定

1337
0:34:03.80 --> 0:34:10.77
几百万电视观众会 按照你的一举一动看直播

1338
0:34:15.52 --> 0:34:18.86
你们最大的担心是什么？ 就是你的摄录机中什么也没有

1339
0:34:18.99 --> 0:34:21.40
这对你们来说很容易 这东西值五万美元！

1340
0:34:21.49 --> 0:34:26.28
那又如何？ 你是让警察、特种部队、防暴队用

1341
0:34:26.37 --> 0:34:28.62
没人会去偷你宝贵的镜头

1342
0:34:28.70 --> 0:34:29.83
你肯定吗？

1343
0:34:29.91 --> 0:34:35.08
试想一下这些在一个顶级表演中的价值

1344
0:34:35.17 --> 0:34:38.17
在今天的价值远远超过50000美元

1345
0:34:38.26 --> 0:34:42.17
从收到的资料看这些 嫌疑人在切尔塔诺夫出现了

1346
0:34:42.26 --> 0:34:44.47
一位老太太确认

1347
0:34:44.55 --> 0:34:49.39
两名巡警那里 我们去确认一下

1348
0:34:49.47 --> 0:34:52.60
无需等待 行动总是比不作为的好

1349
0:34:52.69 --> 0:34:55.35
如果他们在那里 我们越早到越好

1350
0:34:55.44 --> 0:34:57.90
如果没有的话 我们会告诉记者警方有干活

1351
0:34:57.90 --> 0:34:59.69
诸如追踪线索之类的

1352
0:35:04.16 --> 0:35:06.62
我们该做什么？ 怎么打开？

1353
0:35:06.70 --> 0:35:08.87
只是不要乱碰就行

1354
0:35:08.95 --> 0:35:11.45
它们都是在控制中心控制的

1355
0:35:12.46 --> 0:35:14.83
到你的位置上去！ 跑步走！来吧！

1356
0:35:25.22 --> 0:35:26.64
一个令人难以置信的区域

1357
0:35:27.10 --> 0:35:29.05
老大，你认为他们真在这里？

1358
0:35:29.64 --> 0:35:31.10
那个老太太不可靠

1359
0:35:31.93 --> 0:35:35.60
为什么不呢？如果我是罪犯 这就是我想要躲藏的地方

1360
0:35:35.69 --> 0:35:40.07
收到了吗？明白了吗？ 是的，我明白了

1361
0:35:55.25 --> 0:35:57.79
- 那我们怎么办？  - 我不知道。

1362
0:36:02.13 --> 0:36:05.93
我们在这件案子中落后了 特种部队

1363
0:36:07.22 --> 0:36:10.35
直到他们来到这里 我们继续监视

1364
0:36:12.97 --> 0:36:14.39
那么我们要回家睡觉了

1365
0:37:11.87 --> 0:37:13.08
赫尔曼，警察在这里

1366
0:37:14.20 --> 0:37:17.50
有4个便衣已在这里 我们要分开

1367
0:37:19.37 --> 0:37:21.96
收到。在八楼见

1368
0:37:23.88 --> 0:37:25.17
我们离开

1369
0:37:54.53 --> 0:37:57.62
我们去哪儿？ 这里的所有出入口都连通了

1370
0:37:57.70 --> 0:38:01.21
他可能在任何地方，任何楼层 这是个迷宫

1371
0:38:01.29 --> 0:38:04.00
疯狂的建筑！没见过这种事

1372
0:38:07.92 --> 0:38:12.30
没关系。我们已经包围他们了 现在，正如他们所说，还没有逃出去

1373
0:38:16.51 --> 0:38:19.64
亲爱的，你根本想象不到

1374
0:38:19.73 --> 0:38:25.81
所有这些穿着防弹背心的壮汉都听我的

1375
0:38:28.40 --> 0:38:32.57
没有人干涉我的工作 刚好相反

1376
0:38:32.91 --> 0:38:37.58
好吧，亲爱的，我的对讲机响了 再见，我会打电话给你。

1377
0:38:41.04 --> 0:38:42.71
瓦碧茨卡佳，收到了吗？

1378
0:38:42.79 --> 0:38:47.84
在切尔塔诺夫正在交火 斯米尔诺夫小组报告，他们在追捕

1379
0:38:47.92 --> 0:38:52.80
打电话叫他们停止！ 每个人都必须按计划来！

1380
0:38:52.88 --> 0:38:56.39
我们到达那里前 什么事也不要做

1381
0:38:56.47 --> 0:38:59.72
在那里入口等我们

1382
0:39:18.37 --> 0:39:19.62
行动！

1383
0:39:20.87 --> 0:39:22.33
去到你们的位置！

1384
0:39:25.08 --> 0:39:27.00
快！

1385
0:39:37.10 --> 0:39:40.39
他们怎么发现我们的？ 一些混蛋背叛了我们

1386
0:39:40.47 --> 0:39:43.06
瓦勒拉，收拾一下 我们要离开这里

1387
0:40:13.63 --> 0:40:17.47
我们达成了协议 你现在不能退出！

1388
0:40:18.39 --> 0:40:21.93
我知道你在塞车，但你要及时赶到 这只是刚刚开始

1389
0:40:59.09 --> 0:41:00.34
这是什么？

1390
0:41:00.43 --> 0:41:03.35
瓦尔哈拉，我们出的矿泉水

1391
0:41:05.64 --> 0:41:06.89
什么水？

1392
0:41:07.94 --> 0:41:09.27
纯天然的

1393
0:41:09.94 --> 0:41:12.90
不要担心，谢尔盖.彼得罗维奇，免费的。

1394
0:41:12.98 --> 0:41:16.94
我们的军队需要喝 对记者不说免费

1395
0:41:17.03 --> 0:41:22.28
免费，我不这么认为 今天一整天都直播

1396
0:41:22.37 --> 0:41:25.20
他们应该付钱给我们

1397
0:41:25.29 --> 0:41:26.87
我们可以稍后谈

1398
0:41:26.96 --> 0:41:34.00
当每个人都在时，我们召开 第一次大约40分钟的记者招待会

1399
0:41:34.09 --> 0:41:35.30
摩托车手是谁？

1400
0:41:38.72 --> 0:41:39.84
是他还是你？

1401
0:41:44.68 --> 0:41:47.77
他不是摩托车手 他是一位好导演

1402
0:41:48.48 --> 0:41:52.56
也许是最好的 至少在广告上是

1403
0:41:53.44 --> 0:41:54.98
他可靠吗？

1404
0:41:54.98 --> 0:41:57.07
是，将军同志。  - 好

1405
0:42:46.91 --> 0:42:48.04
三亚！手榴弹！

1406
0:42:54.75 --> 0:42:57.34
我的上帝！那是什么？ 瓦斯爆炸？

1407
0:43:05.26 --> 0:43:08.14
他们都发疯了吗？

1408
0:43:08.22 --> 0:43:10.06
为什么？我们正在抓捕罪犯！

1409
0:43:10.14 --> 0:43:13.31
给我对讲机！我现在 要和这个斯米尔诺夫说

1410
0:43:13.81 --> 0:43:15.27
斯米尔诺夫？

1411
0:43:16.31 --> 0:43:17.56
斯米尔诺夫少校？

1412
0:43:17.65 --> 0:43:20.32
叫他坦波夫。这是他的代号

1413
0:43:21.78 --> 0:43:23.49
坦波夫！你收到了吗？

1414
0:43:24.11 --> 0:43:26.20
他是聋子？坦波夫！

1415
0:43:27.58 --> 0:43:29.16
斯米尔诺夫！

1416
0:43:30.20 --> 0:43:31.79
斯米尔诺夫少校！

1417
0:43:31.87 --> 0:43:35.92
坦波夫！你收到了吗？

1418
0:43:47.26 --> 0:43:48.39
我是坦波夫

1419
0:43:49.97 --> 0:43:53.56
我是瓦碧茨卡佳上尉。你干什么呀？

1420
0:43:55.40 --> 0:43:57.19
手榴弹。杀伤性的

1421
0:43:58.11 --> 0:44:01.40
几乎要了我们的命 这层已经清理，该团伙不在这里

1422
0:44:01.48 --> 0:44:04.61
少校，难道你不清楚你的命令？

1423
0:44:05.24 --> 0:44:09.91
你之前就不要这样做 我命令你立即离开大厦

1424
0:44:10.33 --> 0:44:11.41
你明白吗？

1425
0:44:11.49 --> 0:44:13.04
她在向我发号施令？

1426
0:44:15.16 --> 0:44:16.62
我在和谁说话？

1427
0:44:18.54 --> 0:44:21.13
这次行动的副总指挥

1428
0:44:27.55 --> 0:44:29.22
上尉，我不明白你的问题

1429
0:44:29.30 --> 0:44:31.39
没有特种部队士兵在我们的楼层上

1430
0:44:31.47 --> 0:44:34.68
您可以封锁楼梯，并开始清查低楼层

1431
0:44:34.77 --> 0:44:38.35
听着，少校，我不在乎你想什么

1432
0:44:38.44 --> 0:44:40.94
这是一项特别行动

1433
0:44:41.02 --> 0:44:45.78
我没时间给你解释所有细节

1434
0:44:45.86 --> 0:44:49.20
只是要你服从命令 不要阻碍专业人士行动

1435
0:44:50.58 --> 0:44:52.08
明白了吗？

1436
0:44:53.37 --> 0:44:54.83
我重复，明白了吗？

1437
0:45:01.63 --> 0:45:02.67
明白

1438
0:45:05.72 --> 0:45:08.59
那我们要撤？

1439
0:45:09.39 --> 0:45:12.85
马上撤！并疏散所有居民

1440
0:45:14.06 --> 0:45:16.48
别笑，你不是在舞台上

1441
0:45:19.31 --> 0:45:20.65
那我们怎么办？

1442
0:45:23.19 --> 0:45:24.98
婊子！

1443
0:45:26.24 --> 0:45:28.40
瓦碧茨卡佳。怎么不让她去死？

1444
0:45:28.49 --> 0:45:31.70
你记得曾经有一个部门的领导 是瓦彼特斯基将军吗？

1445
0:45:31.78 --> 0:45:35.95
一两年前已经死了，我听说过他 安排给他女儿一件很轻松的工作

1446
0:45:36.04 --> 0:45:39.66
这个可能是她，一个真正的高干子弟。  - 那又怎样？

1447
0:45:41.08 --> 0:45:42.88
我要吻她的屁股吗？

1448
0:45:43.92 --> 0:45:45.75
瓦碧茨卡佳

1449
0:45:49.09 --> 0:45:50.72
你坐在这儿干嘛？

1450
0:45:52.85 --> 0:45:56.06
起床喽！我们去检查七楼

1451
0:46:08.82 --> 0:46:12.11
今天你有个绝无仅有的机会观看

1452
0:46:12.20 --> 0:46:14.70
一个危险团伙在电视上被抓获

1453
0:46:14.78 --> 0:46:17.12
这群躲在这里的罪犯牵涉了…

1454
0:46:17.20 --> 0:46:19.62
昨天在莫斯科市中心的枪战

1455
0:46:19.71 --> 0:46:24.00
每隔半小时就会对这个行动 的进展情况进行实时更新

1456
0:46:24.09 --> 0:46:28.63
给予我们帮助的是莫斯科 警察署公关部副部长

1457
0:46:28.71 --> 0:46:30.55
艾卡特丽娜.瓦碧茨卡佳

1458
0:46:31.22 --> 0:46:33.30
下午好，亲爱的观众

1459
0:46:49.36 --> 0:46:54.41
第28区居民，请保持冷静！现正在疏散

1460
0:46:54.49 --> 0:46:56.41
孩子，该走了

1461
0:46:56.49 --> 0:47:00.58
带上你们的证件在房间等

1462
0:47:00.66 --> 0:47:04.79
执法人员会带你们到安全地方

1463
0:47:04.88 --> 0:47:10.05
爸爸，警察说，我们应该留在房间

1464
0:47:10.13 --> 0:47:15.39
儿子，就像以往一样，警察说的就当爸爸说的

1465
0:47:15.47 --> 0:47:17.97
你要和他们说的相反

1466
0:47:19.68 --> 0:47:23.23
当你长大了，就会明白 什么样的人能当警察

1467
0:47:23.64 --> 0:47:26.06
另外，奶奶正等着我们，走吧

1468
0:47:27.32 --> 0:47:28.40
喂

1469
0:47:30.28 --> 0:47:33.07
你应该听警察的，爸爸

1470
0:47:33.95 --> 0:47:36.57
我们要去奶奶那里，她正等着我们

1471
0:47:36.66 --> 0:47:38.20
你奶奶在这！

1472
0:47:41.50 --> 0:47:45.12
你是警察吗？你真的是吗？

1473
0:47:45.21 --> 0:47:48.96
警察不会拿枪对着我们。他们是强盗！

1474
0:47:49.05 --> 0:47:50.71
儿子比他爸爸聪明

1475
0:47:50.80 --> 0:47:52.42
你们是土匪？

1476
0:47:53.05 --> 0:47:57.89
但我们没有什么。我们是普通人！ 我只是一个出租车司机。

1477
0:47:57.97 --> 0:48:01.89
笑一笑，女娃！来嘛，笑一笑！

1478
0:48:01.97 --> 0:48:04.81
别害羞！

1479
0:48:04.89 --> 0:48:10.02
放了我们吧。拿走你们喜欢的东西 我们不会和任何人说的

1480
0:48:10.11 --> 0:48:13.61
不要叽叽喳喳了

1481
0:48:13.69 --> 0:48:18.20
笑一笑，女娃…我要你笑一个！ 你的一切表情己被拍到了

1482
0:48:18.28 --> 0:48:19.41
克利！

1483
0:48:23.70 --> 0:48:27.50
你总是这样！ 这都是你的错，爸爸

1484
0:48:29.63 --> 0:48:32.63
我们不会伤害你们 只要你们和我们呆一段

1485
0:48:33.96 --> 0:48:35.55
上帝，我要怎么做？

1486
0:48:35.63 --> 0:48:39.97
拉上窗帘，打开电视 坐下来，闭嘴

1487
0:48:41.31 --> 0:48:42.56
不要烦躁

1488
0:48:44.56 --> 0:48:49.94
撤离这栋楼！带上你们的证件到出口处

1489
0:48:51.86 --> 0:48:54.94
离开吧！撤离这栋楼！

1490
0:49:00.83 --> 0:49:02.74
带上你们的证件

1491
0:49:05.25 --> 0:49:08.42
这里在疏散，我会打电话给你

1492
0:49:08.50 --> 0:49:13.25
请保持冷静，现正在疏散

1493
0:49:13.59 --> 0:49:17.97
带上你们的证件在房间里等待

1494
0:49:18.05 --> 0:49:22.51
执法人员会带你们到安全地方

1495
0:49:32.82 --> 0:49:35.94
奥尔达，现场已封锁

1496
0:49:36.03 --> 0:49:37.99
我们在11楼128房

1497
0:49:38.07 --> 0:49:39.49
你的手机要开着

1498
0:49:39.57 --> 0:49:42.45
知道了，赫尔曼，我会下来找你们

1499
0:49:46.95 --> 0:49:50.25
这么吵！大家都在跑！大叫着！

1500
0:49:50.33 --> 0:49:53.21
你如何评价这次警方的疏散行动？

1501
0:49:53.29 --> 0:49:57.92
好啊，正常的 确实应该这样做

1502
0:49:58.76 --> 0:50:01.63
他们对你们客气吗？ 可以说是吧

1503
0:50:01.72 --> 0:50:03.39
他们按门铃，说：

1504
0:50:03.47 --> 0:50:07.97
“来吧，太太，快离开这儿到走廊去！”

1505
0:50:08.06 --> 0:50:10.27
我能和谁打下招呼吗？

1506
0:50:10.35 --> 0:50:13.56
你明白自己想要拍什么吗？

1507
0:50:14.32 --> 0:50:15.77
罗马，等着，不要大惊小怪

1508
0:50:15.86 --> 0:50:19.57
这一切即将开始，我们会处理好的

1509
0:50:19.65 --> 0:50:23.82
即将开始？已经开始了！ 还是手榴弹随时都会在这里爆炸？

1510
0:50:24.41 --> 0:50:26.66
而你甚至不知道下一刻会发生什么

1511
0:50:26.74 --> 0:50:28.75
你害怕？

1512
0:50:29.66 --> 0:50:32.46
不，我只是想了解我为什么在这里

1513
0:50:32.54 --> 0:50:35.04
顺便说一下，请给我 一个防弹背心和头盔

1514
0:50:35.13 --> 0:50:38.76
这是如何完成你所有特别行动的常识

1515
0:50:40.63 --> 0:50:44.18
到走廊去！不要停下来

1516
0:50:44.26 --> 0:50:46.64
走吧，准备好你们的证件

1517
0:50:48.27 --> 0:50:49.43
站住！

1518
0:50:49.85 --> 0:50:51.39
那个穿皮衣的！站住！

1519
0:50:52.06 --> 0:50:53.44
你聋了吗？

1520
0:51:16.54 --> 0:51:17.59
快点！

1521
0:51:18.50 --> 0:51:19.88
跟着他们，伙计！

1522
0:51:39.61 --> 0:51:40.94
老大爷！

1523
0:51:42.24 --> 0:51:44.45
老大爷！看起来他是聋子

1524
0:51:45.95 --> 0:51:50.24
老大爷，回家！ 他们向我们开枪了！走开

1525
0:52:40.42 --> 0:52:43.46
- 奥尔达  - 赫尔曼，这里有特种部队

1526
0:52:43.55 --> 0:52:45.76
- 有多少？        - 至少5个

1527
0:52:49.09 --> 0:52:50.85
试着找我们，我们会见面的

1528
0:53:55.24 --> 0:53:56.83
赫尔曼，别开枪，是我

1529
0:53:57.41 --> 0:53:59.87
别开枪，是奥尔达 他在哪儿？

1530
0:54:06.30 --> 0:54:07.34
楼上？

1531
0:54:11.43 --> 0:54:13.30
你受伤了吗？

1532
0:54:42.54 --> 0:54:46.75
如果你喜欢射击到外面去 那里大约有300个枪手

1533
0:54:46.84 --> 0:54:48.09
我注意到了

1534
0:54:48.76 --> 0:54:50.01
你们是谁？

1535
0:54:50.88 --> 0:54:55.93
我们？我们是医生，你们呢？

1536
0:54:57.85 --> 0:54:59.60
我们是无国界医生

1537
0:55:15.91 --> 0:55:18.28
我是尤里

1538
0:55:19.50 --> 0:55:21.12
但你们可以叫我尤拉

1539
0:55:21.21 --> 0:55:23.46
爸爸！       什么？

1540
0:55:23.96 --> 0:55:26.08
我们都在同一条船上！

1541
0:55:27.88 --> 0:55:29.55
一艘潜艇

1542
0:55:31.55 --> 0:55:34.22
第一场战斗绝对是失败的

1543
0:55:34.80 --> 0:55:36.14
怎么受创的？

1544
0:55:36.22 --> 0:55:41.10
正在撤离第8号入口 我们清理了记者区

1545
0:55:41.18 --> 0:55:45.73
有5到7个歹徒躲藏在128房

1546
0:55:45.81 --> 0:55:48.73
房子里有出租车司机 尤里.希罗科夫和他的两个孩子

1547
0:55:48.82 --> 0:55:51.65
我半小时前曾和克里姆林宫说

1548
0:55:54.78 --> 0:55:59.99
如果无辜的平民特别是 小孩死于这场行动

1549
0:56:01.83 --> 0:56:03.87
而且在现场直播

1550
0:56:05.08 --> 0:56:07.04
他们将不会原谅我们的错误

1551
0:56:09.96 --> 0:56:15.63
现在，我们需要动动脑筋 收视率非常理想

1552
0:56:17.09 --> 0:56:21.43
我要在晚上结束行动

1553
0:56:22.10 --> 0:56:23.27
这是个黄金收视时段

1554
0:56:23.35 --> 0:56:25.23
不要和我说晚上！

1555
0:56:25.89 --> 0:56:27.73
我们现在应该怎么做？

1556
0:56:29.65 --> 0:56:32.65
你想要什么样的新闻？ 我希望不是现在这个

1557
0:56:34.15 --> 0:56:35.36
黄金时间！

1558
0:56:36.20 --> 0:56:40.41
卡佳，要把这些摄像机的数据 传输到服务器上吗？

1559
0:56:41.20 --> 0:56:43.49
是的        - 那这些已经数字化？

1560
0:56:43.58 --> 0:56:46.71
卡佳，这是好东西，我们可以用

1561
0:56:46.79 --> 0:56:49.04
我们可以从中提取我们需要的东西

1562
0:56:49.13 --> 0:56:53.00
你怎么看？ 当然，我们可以很快做到

1563
0:56:53.09 --> 0:56:55.01
罗马，你是一个天才！

1564
0:56:55.72 --> 0:56:59.05
我还没有完全得到我们所要做的

1565
0:56:59.14 --> 0:57:00.93
在记者招待会上准备好！

1566
0:57:04.22 --> 0:57:11.31
上一小时内的两次爆炸，之前的交火

1567
0:57:11.52 --> 0:57:12.90
嘿，小家伙，你过来！

1568
0:57:12.98 --> 0:57:16.07
莫斯科警方发言人称已和该团伙交火

1569
0:57:16.15 --> 0:57:17.45
看！

1570
0:57:17.53 --> 0:57:21.16
92式阿贝瑞塔  9毫米口径

1571
0:57:21.24 --> 0:57:24.16
16发的半自动手枪

1572
0:57:24.24 --> 0:57:31.04
完全由不锈钢制造 非常罕见，已经停产了

1573
0:57:31.13 --> 0:57:36.21
拿着。喜欢吗？ 是的，好酷！

1574
0:57:36.72 --> 0:57:39.05
等你大了，你会有把更好的

1575
0:57:39.13 --> 0:57:41.76
听着，你玩不玩小孩的智力游戏？

1576
0:57:42.89 --> 0:57:45.31
他还可以成长为一个正常的人

1577
0:57:45.39 --> 0:57:50.73
我说什么了？你觉得携带枪支的人不正常

1578
0:57:50.81 --> 0:57:52.19
克利，把枪放下

1579
0:57:53.48 --> 0:57:55.69
那好吧。你去玩你的游戏去

1580
0:58:01.82 --> 0:58:05.45
16:35分，特种部队进入犯罪分子在的10楼走廊

1581
0:58:05.54 --> 0:58:14.00
这里有超出我们预料的更多歹徒 我们的部队开火还击

1582
0:58:14.09 --> 0:58:17.34
犯罪分子胆怯退却到房间里

1583
0:58:17.42 --> 0:58:18.84
他们可能抓住了人质

1584
0:58:20.05 --> 0:58:22.18
现在我们知道他们在哪里

1585
0:58:22.26 --> 0:58:25.39
这项行动的第一阶段已经顺利完成

1586
0:58:25.47 --> 0:58:31.10
我们的当务之急是要避免平民伤亡

1587
0:58:31.19 --> 0:58:33.77
顺利完成？废话！

1588
0:58:33.98 --> 0:58:37.61
如果你想在电视里听到真话 去看动物世界

1589
0:58:37.69 --> 0:58:39.32
其余的都是撒谎

1590
0:58:39.40 --> 0:58:41.70
他们不是在撒谎。是一个真人秀

1591
0:58:42.49 --> 0:58:45.66
他们可能做一个节目 我这里有个真的

1592
0:58:46.62 --> 0:58:48.16
看！

1593
0:58:49.79 --> 0:58:53.29
拿一些东西来代替 斯皮尔伯格的崇拜者

1594
0:59:00.76 --> 0:59:03.59
嗨，你叫什么名字？ 瓦迪克

1595
0:59:03.68 --> 0:59:05.72
听着，瓦迪克，互联网能用吗？ 你难道还不明白？

1596
0:59:05.80 --> 0:59:08.39
你不可能在没有互联网的情况下玩Entropia

1597
0:59:08.97 --> 0:59:10.85
你能连接手机到电脑吗？

1598
0:59:10.93 --> 0:59:13.02
能，但我不干

1599
0:59:13.73 --> 0:59:15.52
我儿子是个电脑天才

1600
0:59:15.61 --> 0:59:18.44
这台电脑我帮他买的 还是贷款买的

1601
0:59:18.53 --> 0:59:22.19
他会帮你们做任何事的

1602
0:59:22.28 --> 0:59:23.49
我不帮罪犯！

1603
0:59:23.57 --> 0:59:27.24
你不帮是什么意思？ 现在要按他们的意思做！

1604
0:59:27.33 --> 0:59:29.20
你是个胆小鬼

1605
0:59:29.29 --> 0:59:33.54
我们不是要你做什么坏事 我们只是告诉人们真相

1606
0:59:33.62 --> 0:59:36.92
听着，老兄，不要玩了

1607
0:59:37.00 --> 0:59:40.55
而且你不尊重你父亲 这会伤害到他的

1608
0:59:40.63 --> 0:59:42.88
那好吧，你的手机有蓝牙吗？

1609
0:59:42.97 --> 0:59:44.63
当然有，给你

1610
0:59:45.84 --> 0:59:48.64
我女儿对电脑也很在行

1611
0:59:50.64 --> 0:59:52.73
她整天挂在网上

1612
1:00:04.61 --> 1:00:08.07
那么，现在怎么说？

1613
1:00:08.16 --> 1:00:12.45
我们又一次完全像个白痴！

1614
1:00:12.54 --> 1:00:14.33
这些罪犯总是领先我们一步

1615
1:00:14.41 --> 1:00:16.96
这与我有什么关系？是你们的素材

1616
1:00:17.04 --> 1:00:19.00
还有什么我能做的？

1617
1:00:19.09 --> 1:00:21.75
我所能做的就是提出了 一个编辑方案

1618
1:00:21.84 --> 1:00:26.68
等等。他们已经宣布对我们的信息战 但他们根本没有机会

1619
1:00:26.76 --> 1:00:30.18
我们掌握了所有王牌 我整天都听到这些

1620
1:00:30.64 --> 1:00:32.22
你到底有什么建议？

1621
1:00:33.68 --> 1:00:37.69
当然有，删了这组镜头吧！ 该死！好，导演同志？

1622
1:00:38.56 --> 1:00:41.11
你能不能把这段黑掉？

1623
1:00:41.69 --> 1:00:44.49
恐怕不能 最有可能在其他地方他们也已发送

1624
1:00:44.57 --> 1:00:48.24
如果他们够聪明 可能已经把这些镜头发给所有的新闻机构

1625
1:00:48.32 --> 1:00:49.95
和电视频道

1626
1:00:51.28 --> 1:00:54.37
你知不知道你在说什么？

1627
1:00:56.42 --> 1:00:59.17
你知道这对我们来说意味着什么？

1628
1:01:00.54 --> 1:01:01.79
我知道

1629
1:01:03.00 --> 1:01:05.01
我正在准备对策

1630
1:01:05.76 --> 1:01:07.76
我会写一个新的新闻发布稿

1631
1:01:08.39 --> 1:01:14.06
说是恐怖分子劫持了两个小孩做人质

1632
1:01:16.06 --> 1:01:17.35
恐怖分子？

1633
1:01:21.19 --> 1:01:22.65
好

1634
1:01:24.11 --> 1:01:26.11
对，继续干！

1635
1:01:28.53 --> 1:01:32.53
我需要这些小孩的高分辨率图片

1636
1:01:32.62 --> 1:01:35.95
与他们到学校取得联系 或找到他们的亲属

1637
1:01:36.04 --> 1:01:38.71
如果需要可以用任何手段

1638
1:01:38.79 --> 1:01:41.46
这些小孩激发同情心 的相片要在一小时内

1639
1:01:41.54 --> 1:01:46.13
那么就会融化所有女观众的心

1640
1:01:46.97 --> 1:01:55.22
还有切断这里所有的电话和互联网

1641
1:01:57.14 --> 1:02:01.23
干的好！图像质量没的说

1642
1:02:03.73 --> 1:02:05.65
你的小短片没有任何意义

1643
1:02:05.73 --> 1:02:08.74
您上传到互联网 但他们已经控制了所有的电视频道

1644
1:02:08.82 --> 1:02:11.41
至少现在他们不会迎头攻击我们

1645
1:02:14.49 --> 1:02:17.24
- 也许我们应该吃些什么？   - 我不想吃

1646
1:02:18.75 --> 1:02:21.08
- 你做功课？   - 我没有做！

1647
1:02:22.04 --> 1:02:25.09
我们是人质 人质不做功课！

1648
1:02:25.71 --> 1:02:29.84
如果他们不杀我们，明天我们还要上学

1649
1:02:29.93 --> 1:02:31.63
即使我没有做功课！

1650
1:02:31.72 --> 1:02:34.18
要做！照他们说的做

1651
1:02:36.26 --> 1:02:39.64
完全失控，不想读书。

1652
1:02:40.27 --> 1:02:42.10
只关心玩他的电脑

1653
1:02:42.19 --> 1:02:44.86
学校每周都打电话找我谈话

1654
1:02:46.23 --> 1:02:49.07
你要我试试给他一些积极的影响吗？

1655
1:02:50.90 --> 1:02:55.03
小子，你要读书 要不然你会变得和我们一样

1656
1:02:55.12 --> 1:02:57.99
警察总是跟着你，你想这样吗？

1657
1:02:58.08 --> 1:03:00.54
尤拉，你会烹饪吗？ 当然会

1658
1:03:00.62 --> 1:03:02.21
那做一些给我们吃

1659
1:03:02.29 --> 1:03:05.38
帮我和摩托车一起照张相 然后我帮你照

1660
1:03:06.96 --> 1:03:09.00
那么记者招待会开的怎样？

1661
1:03:09.76 --> 1:03:11.01
那些记者怎样了？

1662
1:03:11.59 --> 1:03:14.89
嗡嗡的像蜜蜂一样追问每件事

1663
1:03:14.97 --> 1:03:17.26
现在大家都觉得为穷孩子

1664
1:03:19.06 --> 1:03:23.56
往那儿看 已经播了，做得好

1665
1:03:28.57 --> 1:03:30.44
网络断了

1666
1:03:30.53 --> 1:03:35.24
我怎么做功课？ 又不是我的错

1667
1:03:35.24 --> 1:03:39.33
将你的Skylink给我好吗？ 我要试一下连一连

1668
1:03:40.45 --> 1:03:42.45
有趣，你怎么这么厚脸皮？

1669
1:03:43.04 --> 1:03:45.08
看看你爸爸，静的像条黄瓜

1670
1:04:07.02 --> 1:04:08.11
需要帮忙吗？

1671
1:04:17.24 --> 1:04:20.91
要吸食可卡因吗？来吧

1672
1:04:50.57 --> 1:04:52.36
你父亲真的会做饭？

1673
1:04:52.73 --> 1:04:57.45
不会，他只会用微波炉 奶奶过来做饭的

1674
1:05:12.71 --> 1:05:14.92
嘿，小心魔鬼！

1675
1:05:16.51 --> 1:05:19.13
开枪射他！是啊！ 我开枪了！

1676
1:05:21.72 --> 1:05:28.02
了不起！来吧。再来 不要停下来，继续玩，向前！

1677
1:05:28.10 --> 1:05:32.02
你在干什么？不要做白日梦！ 你没看到他在进攻？

1678
1:05:33.86 --> 1:05:37.03
逼它到角落！开火！

1679
1:05:45.04 --> 1:05:46.75
科斯提克瓦街1号，下午6点

1680
1:05:55.38 --> 1:05:59.76
尤拉，去收拾一下桌子，我来替你

1681
1:06:01.01 --> 1:06:03.60
留意一下土豆

1682
1:06:05.18 --> 1:06:06.31
把刀递给我

1683
1:06:13.61 --> 1:06:16.65
你留下外套那里引发了我的好奇心？

1684
1:06:16.74 --> 1:06:18.19
也许我做完了

1685
1:06:22.82 --> 1:06:25.49
我对你那行有不同的印象

1686
1:06:27.41 --> 1:06:31.17
除了你有一个拍档和口袋里的相片 逆着所有规则行事

1687
1:06:31.25 --> 1:06:33.79
电视毁了你的青少年时代

1688
1:06:34.67 --> 1:06:36.09
规则…

1689
1:06:36.42 --> 1:06:40.63
你知道，最好的规则是没有规则

1690
1:06:44.89 --> 1:06:46.35
这有紫苏吗？

1691
1:06:46.43 --> 1:06:48.64
- 只有莳萝。     - 那个等会儿做

1692
1:06:53.48 --> 1:06:55.81
你熟悉这栋楼吗？

1693
1:06:58.86 --> 1:06:59.99
你有什么计划？

1694
1:07:07.12 --> 1:07:08.79
你可真乐观

1695
1:07:10.75 --> 1:07:12.58
我已经开始落后了

1696
1:07:14.42 --> 1:07:16.50
最好的计划就是没有计划

1697
1:07:23.01 --> 1:07:26.72
- 你喜欢吃辣的？ - 是的。

1698
1:07:29.60 --> 1:07:32.35
哦，大厨，小吃怎么样？

1699
1:07:32.44 --> 1:07:35.56
- 就快了          - 快点吧

1700
1:07:38.32 --> 1:07:39.57
年轻的四眼呢？

1701
1:07:41.07 --> 1:07:42.49
瓦勒拉？

1702
1:07:43.82 --> 1:07:46.91
要决定命运了。和你们？

1703
1:07:48.62 --> 1:07:50.33
这很难

1704
1:07:53.41 --> 1:07:59.88
警方正试图与绑架人质的团伙接触…

1705
1:07:59.96 --> 1:08:05.22
…试图进行谈判。这里是特约记者奥尔加.斯托亚娃的报道

1706
1:08:22.28 --> 1:08:26.24
你现在正在收看的是市场报告的特别版节目PBK

1707
1:08:26.32 --> 1:08:29.20
由于在莫斯科市中心发生的事件 使投资者的反应消极，

1708
1:08:29.28 --> 1:08:30.91
蓝筹股板块下跌约5％...

1709
1:08:31.79 --> 1:08:35.25
我再次恳请你们与我们联系

1710
1:08:35.33 --> 1:08:38.38
就目前的情况，你们唯一的出路…

1711
1:08:38.46 --> 1:08:40.59
就是释放人质还有投降

1712
1:08:40.67 --> 1:08:43.38
请不要使已经十分困难的情况...

1713
1:08:43.46 --> 1:08:46.22
来吧！来吧，兄弟！追他！

1714
1:08:47.22 --> 1:08:51.43
瓦迪克，过来帮一下爸爸 你等下再过来玩

1715
1:08:52.43 --> 1:08:56.64
- 有伏特加吗？  - 没有，我不怎么喝酒

1716
1:08:57.65 --> 1:09:00.77
又是陪孩子啊又是工作还其他事

1717
1:09:01.82 --> 1:09:07.03
但我有一瓶亚拉拉特 不错的亚美尼亚白兰地

1718
1:09:09.12 --> 1:09:12.24
这里，来吧！

1719
1:09:13.29 --> 1:09:15.70
这瓶酒20年了，我还以为你很穷呢

1720
1:09:15.79 --> 1:09:22.17
这是一名老主顾给我的 放了很久了

1721
1:09:22.25 --> 1:09:25.46
从来没有开过 没有时间，也没有适合的朋友

1722
1:09:25.55 --> 1:09:30.97
多德，不要放狗屁 如今，你要的朋友都在这里

1723
1:09:31.05 --> 1:09:33.31
这不是真的吧，奶奶？

1724
1:09:35.22 --> 1:09:40.40
好，伙计们，你们做了了不起的事情

1725
1:09:41.44 --> 1:09:48.70
即使用相同的材料 我也从来没做出过如此美妙的食物

1726
1:09:48.78 --> 1:09:51.87
孩子们，谢谢这些绅士! 瞧他们为我们做的食物

1727
1:09:54.99 --> 1:09:58.62
听着，神经先生 克制一下，坐下来吃饭

1728
1:09:58.71 --> 1:10:01.25
也许他和我们一张台时不能站着吃

1729
1:10:02.29 --> 1:10:04.92
或者你是怕警察会抓你的甜品吧？

1730
1:10:05.00 --> 1:10:06.13
克利！

1731
1:10:06.21 --> 1:10:09.88
伙计们，我们一起喝酒

1732
1:10:13.43 --> 1:10:18.77
喝酒可以加深了解

1733
1:10:21.35 --> 1:10:24.82
来吧，我们喝

1734
1:10:29.40 --> 1:10:32.53
瓦迪克，坐下

1735
1:10:34.66 --> 1:10:37.58
不要为他生气 这只是他的方式

1736
1:10:37.66 --> 1:10:41.87
你要知道，今天的孩子 他们看了许多电视

1737
1:10:41.96 --> 1:10:44.42
而且只有枪战和汽车追逐！

1738
1:10:44.50 --> 1:10:48.13
不像今天这样，嗯？ 我们不是这样的

1739
1:10:48.21 --> 1:10:51.34
孩子不喜欢今天这样吗？ 我确定他们喜欢

1740
1:10:53.05 --> 1:10:58.60
比我们成长的时候好多了 我们喝

1741
1:10:59.31 --> 1:11:02.10
瓦迪克，不要生气

1742
1:11:03.23 --> 1:11:07.44
当你长大后会成为一名警察 追捕像我们这样的家伙

1743
1:11:08.82 --> 1:11:11.32
我也曾经想成为一名警察

1744
1:11:25.96 --> 1:11:28.05
我们喝

1745
1:11:30.21 --> 1:11:34.38
他们不像残酷的恐怖分子

1746
1:11:35.14 --> 1:11:36.89
看

1747
1:11:39.81 --> 1:11:41.89
为什么我们也不午休？

1748
1:11:41.98 --> 1:11:46.35
我们在行动期间从来不午休

1749
1:11:46.44 --> 1:11:47.86
我们总是没有吃的

1750
1:11:47.94 --> 1:11:52.07
不要忘了这是一个不寻常 的行动，包括媒体

1751
1:11:52.15 --> 1:11:58.03
我想要表达的是，警察是正常人 他们也需要食物

1752
1:11:59.29 --> 1:12:00.83
这是聪明的做法

1753
1:12:02.25 --> 1:12:05.29
我们也要分发食物给记者 免费派送

1754
1:12:05.37 --> 1:12:10.00
嗨，我是卡佳，瓦碧茨卡佳

1755
1:12:10.84 --> 1:12:12.09
正在看电视吗？

1756
1:12:13.13 --> 1:12:14.55
好样的

1757
1:12:14.63 --> 1:12:18.05
你的餐厅能送货上门吧？

1758
1:12:19.72 --> 1:12:24.39
我会给一个你满意的价格

1759
1:12:40.58 --> 1:12:43.91
我们去哪儿，奥列格？ 也许他们已经被抓了

1760
1:12:45.79 --> 1:12:47.62
你没事吧？ 还好

1761
1:12:47.71 --> 1:12:49.84
也许我们应该跟总部联系

1762
1:12:49.92 --> 1:12:51.67
不要联系任何人

1763
1:12:54.22 --> 1:12:55.51
他们在这里的某个地方

1764
1:12:58.30 --> 1:13:02.06
我感觉是 感觉？我也觉得是

1765
1:13:02.14 --> 1:13:04.10
一直在部队这么多年

1766
1:13:04.18 --> 1:13:06.81
在电影里像我这样的人总是先被杀

1767
1:13:06.89 --> 1:13:11.40
看看我现在，活蹦乱跳的 甚至还没有受过一次伤

1768
1:13:11.48 --> 1:13:15.19
为什么？经验！ 经验和预感！

1769
1:13:55.23 --> 1:13:59.03
看，奥列格，他是用大号铅弹射击的 难道想干掉我们所有人

1770
1:14:00.03 --> 1:14:02.12
阉了他都算便宜他了

1771
1:14:08.37 --> 1:14:09.46
你叫什么名字？

1772
1:14:14.63 --> 1:14:16.25
疯子

1773
1:14:17.13 --> 1:14:18.42
每个人都那样叫

1774
1:14:19.26 --> 1:14:21.93
你为什么躲到壁橱里，疯子？

1775
1:14:24.01 --> 1:14:29.23
魔鬼跟着我，太阳下山他们就来了

1776
1:14:30.31 --> 1:14:36.11
真是一个伟大的国家！ 没有脑的都有枪

1777
1:14:36.19 --> 1:14:37.57
你为什么开枪？

1778
1:14:39.65 --> 1:14:42.66
你聋了吗？你为什么开枪？ 我不知道

1779
1:14:42.74 --> 1:14:47.54
我昏头了，长官 饿了3天了

1780
1:14:47.62 --> 1:14:50.12
嗯，原来是这样 今天算你走运

1781
1:14:51.17 --> 1:14:53.42
你这样的人渣不值得浪费我的时间

1782
1:14:53.50 --> 1:14:56.75
但如果我再见到你，我会送你进去

1783
1:14:56.84 --> 1:14:59.26
明白了？还是要再我解释？

1784
1:15:02.01 --> 1:15:04.76
走开！让他离开这里

1785
1:15:13.31 --> 1:15:14.60
他们在吃寿司

1786
1:15:15.40 --> 1:15:19.23
你要试下寿司吗？      不

1787
1:15:22.41 --> 1:15:26.57
奥列格，所有人都在吃午餐 而我们都不能吃一口

1788
1:16:10.41 --> 1:16:13.50
这寿司不错 莫斯科的，好吃

1789
1:16:14.17 --> 1:16:17.67
尤其是金枪鱼的更好吃 你说什么，卡佳？

1790
1:16:19.80 --> 1:16:24.97
- 为什么你不吃，谢尔盖.彼得罗维奇？  - 我没心情

1791
1:16:28.26 --> 1:16:30.10
我们已经侵入他们的电脑了

1792
1:16:31.02 --> 1:16:34.85
太棒了。你能连我吗？

1793
1:16:36.73 --> 1:16:40.32
嘿，有人侵入我们的电脑

1794
1:16:41.44 --> 1:16:45.28
我是指挥部副总指挥瓦碧茨卡佳上尉

1795
1:16:46.66 --> 1:16:48.95
谁能和我说话？

1796
1:16:55.16 --> 1:16:56.71
打电话的是个电视明星！

1797
1:16:57.38 --> 1:16:59.38
和我说，上尉

1798
1:17:01.13 --> 1:17:04.26
- 我能叫你卡佳吗？  - 你喜欢叫什么就叫什么吧

1799
1:17:04.34 --> 1:17:08.43
我建议你们立即释放人质，然后投降

1800
1:17:09.47 --> 1:17:10.80
我们可以达成共识

1801
1:17:11.39 --> 1:17:18.02
卡佳，你在屏幕上看起来棒极了 严格说来你很漂亮

1802
1:17:19.19 --> 1:17:23.27
其实，你是我见过最美的警察

1803
1:17:23.36 --> 1:17:24.73
谢谢你

1804
1:17:25.82 --> 1:17:27.49
可惜我不知道你长什么样

1805
1:17:27.57 --> 1:17:30.91
相当难看，但我有一点比你好

1806
1:17:30.99 --> 1:17:32.53
我没有对民众撒谎

1807
1:17:32.54 --> 1:17:35.12
难道他们没有说，永远不要相信一个美女？

1808
1:17:35.20 --> 1:17:37.37
你只是不明白我做什么

1809
1:17:38.08 --> 1:17:40.08
你们不是守法公民

1810
1:17:40.50 --> 1:17:44.80
你们抢银行，杀人，绑架儿童

1811
1:17:44.88 --> 1:17:49.09
这说明我们两个是一类的 我们都知道什么是好，什么是坏

1812
1:17:49.18 --> 1:17:52.47
- 但这并不影响我们  - 和你谈话很有趣

1813
1:17:53.60 --> 1:17:57.27
或许我们可以一起到个更舒适的环境中

1814
1:17:57.35 --> 1:17:59.85
斯米尔诺夫少校在线

1815
1:18:00.90 --> 1:18:02.44
给我对讲机

1816
1:18:02.52 --> 1:18:04.69
等一会，我们还没有谈完

1817
1:18:08.36 --> 1:18:11.28
少校，请离开大楼，懂吗？

1818
1:18:11.37 --> 1:18:15.49
又是你，瓦碧茨卡佳 我不懂为什么要这样做

1819
1:18:16.54 --> 1:18:18.54
给我接彼得鲁上校

1820
1:18:18.62 --> 1:18:20.29
服从命令，少校

1821
1:18:20.37 --> 1:18:22.58
我没有时间解释

1822
1:18:22.59 --> 1:18:24.67
我和罪犯进行重要的谈判

1823
1:18:24.75 --> 1:18:29.01
谈判？你能和他们谈什么？

1824
1:18:29.09 --> 1:18:32.09
他们昨天杀了我们3个伙计

1825
1:18:32.18 --> 1:18:34.85
其中一个是我最好的朋友

1826
1:18:34.93 --> 1:18:37.85
- 少校，你是个大麻烦  - 那个是你

1827
1:18:39.56 --> 1:18:43.61
我不想打探，卡佳 但他是在我们这里的警察？

1828
1:18:44.61 --> 1:18:47.61
是的，他要你血债血偿

1829
1:18:49.57 --> 1:18:54.07
我了解他。我们希望和他聚一聚

1830
1:18:54.91 --> 1:18:59.33
瓦碧茨卡佳，我根本不在乎 你的命令或者你怎样对付我

1831
1:19:00.08 --> 1:19:03.67
只要告诉你的谈判对象 这一切都非常简单

1832
1:19:04.54 --> 1:19:07.63
他是一个罪犯，我会抓到他的

1833
1:19:08.01 --> 1:19:09.63
还有吃了他

1834
1:19:11.76 --> 1:19:13.84
- 吃了他  - 他说了什么？

1835
1:19:13.93 --> 1:19:15.64
这有什么关系？

1836
1:19:15.97 --> 1:19:17.93
最重要的是别的东西

1837
1:19:18.89 --> 1:19:20.60
你无法忍受的

1838
1:19:21.64 --> 1:19:25.23
你必须投降 毕竟你是个通情达理的人

1839
1:19:28.07 --> 1:19:31.82
投降，这很好。好吧

1840
1:19:34.82 --> 1:19:36.62
但是，我们有不同的计划

1841
1:19:40.37 --> 1:19:41.79
发生了什么？

1842
1:19:42.25 --> 1:19:43.62
他去哪儿了？

1843
1:19:44.33 --> 1:19:47.04
我们还没有结束 他没有提出任何要求

1844
1:19:48.00 --> 1:19:50.84
他们关掉了电脑 我们在这里做不了什么

1845
1:19:51.92 --> 1:19:54.05
很酷啊

1846
1:19:55.18 --> 1:19:58.93
一个时髦的家伙，他可以很容易地 成为一个电视明星，看看他的眼睛…

1847
1:19:59.56 --> 1:20:02.93
很出色。观众会喜欢他 他在电视上看起来很棒

1848
1:20:03.02 --> 1:20:06.10
你在说什么？什么出色？

1849
1:20:06.19 --> 1:20:10.65
什么电视明星？他是一个罪犯，一个杀人犯

1850
1:20:10.73 --> 1:20:12.61
在电视上看起来很棒的必须是警察

1851
1:20:12.70 --> 1:20:16.41
- 这个我们达成一致的  - 谢尔盖.彼得罗维奇，请不要担心。

1852
1:20:16.49 --> 1:20:19.53
我们将修改成我们想要的画面

1853
1:20:19.62 --> 1:20:23.25
拜托你，请找到斯米尔诺夫小组 并让他们撤离大楼

1854
1:20:24.29 --> 1:20:28.59
要使用强制手段 这个少校正在破坏我的好事

1855
1:20:28.67 --> 1:20:31.88
先生，有一个外国人在这里 想和你谈谈

1856
1:20:31.96 --> 1:20:34.01
- 什么外国人？  - 我不知道。

1857
1:20:34.09 --> 1:20:36.97
- 不是丹麦就是瑞典电视台的  - 让他们进来

1858
1:20:37.05 --> 1:20:42.31
你疯了？这是行动指挥部

1859
1:20:43.27 --> 1:20:45.56
我们不能让任何外国人进这里

1860
1:20:46.48 --> 1:20:48.81
谢尔盖.彼得罗维奇，保密？

1861
1:20:48.90 --> 1:20:52.28
外国人？我有足够多的

1862
1:20:59.24 --> 1:21:03.41
伙计，别紧张 我们是同一战线的

1863
1:21:03.50 --> 1:21:06.71
你难道没听到吗？你们在干什么？

1864
1:21:06.79 --> 1:21:10.04
趴下！趴下！趴下！

1865
1:21:19.01 --> 1:21:20.05
斯米尔诺夫少校？

1866
1:21:22.60 --> 1:21:25.18
著名的斯米尔诺夫？

1867
1:21:25.56 --> 1:21:29.15
- 是的，为什么？  - 我们去抽支烟吧

1868
1:21:31.82 --> 1:21:33.90
他们给你们的日本料理是真的？

1869
1:21:33.98 --> 1:21:36.99
是啊。生鱼片 像动物园里的企鹅

1870
1:21:37.59 --> 1:21:38.59
你好

1871
1:21:38.59 --> 1:21:44.59
我叫马特迪斯.约翰，瑞典电视台的

1872
1:21:44.59 --> 1:21:49.79
我们有20个电视频道 对这次行动进行直播

1873
1:21:50.19 --> 1:21:52.29
老实说，我从来没有见过这样的事

1874
1:21:52.29 --> 1:21:54.39
有这样现场直播节目

1875
1:21:54.42 --> 1:21:55.76
这样做，少校

1876
1:21:55.84 --> 1:22:00.26
我们都有将你的小组护送出大楼的命令

1877
1:22:01.14 --> 1:22:04.60
如果你们自己离开最好

1878
1:22:05.22 --> 1:22:06.77
你要跟我走吗？

1879
1:22:09.31 --> 1:22:10.73
我懂了

1880
1:22:11.27 --> 1:22:12.98
我明白了

1881
1:22:13.98 --> 1:22:15.61
谢谢

1882
1:22:17.19 --> 1:22:19.36
好，戏已落幕

1883
1:22:21.99 --> 1:22:24.12
- 都回家吧  - 结束了

1884
1:22:24.20 --> 1:22:25.79
你认为我应该怎么办？

1885
1:22:26.75 --> 1:22:29.54
你知道他们有多少人 我们有多少人？

1886
1:22:29.62 --> 1:22:33.04
我能说什么？ 我丈夫没有做错

1887
1:22:33.13 --> 1:22:37.84
他不应被指责，我们有两个孩子！ 他们几乎杀了他！

1888
1:22:37.92 --> 1:22:42.43
他应该得到提拔 我们的孩子还小

1889
1:22:42.51 --> 1:22:44.47
她才开始刚刚上学

1890
1:22:47.22 --> 1:22:49.27
你们只是要坐在这儿吗？

1891
1:22:49.64 --> 1:22:52.65
只是吃，喝，甚至去睡觉？

1892
1:22:53.69 --> 1:22:57.69
我们喜欢这里。我们过得很好。

1893
1:22:59.19 --> 1:23:02.82
我们有人质 我们应该要一部巴士…

1894
1:23:02.91 --> 1:23:05.95
停在入口或屋顶上的直升机

1895
1:23:06.03 --> 1:23:07.45
清醒一点

1896
1:23:07.54 --> 1:23:10.66
你上一次什么时候见到过 他们接受这样的要求？

1897
1:23:10.75 --> 1:23:13.58
他们也将只是敷衍我们和人质

1898
1:23:13.67 --> 1:23:14.88
电视上，他们会说：

1899
1:23:14.96 --> 1:23:18.76
“行动的最后阶段成功结束。”

1900
1:23:18.84 --> 1:23:21.42
保持冷静，紧张先生

1901
1:23:21.51 --> 1:23:24.22
我们要突围 有命才有希望

1902
1:23:24.30 --> 1:23:26.60
还有他们想怎样就怎样

1903
1:23:26.68 --> 1:23:30.64
等命运决定吧。在任何情况下 都比没命要好些

1904
1:23:32.48 --> 1:23:34.81
往哪里突围？这个和命有什么关系？

1905
1:23:34.90 --> 1:23:38.27
谁想没命？我和此事无关！

1906
1:23:40.61 --> 1:23:42.28
你为什么不说话？

1907
1:23:45.03 --> 1:23:46.74
我正在听你说

1908
1:23:53.37 --> 1:23:57.38
放你的狗屁，你这个闷蛋！

1909
1:23:57.96 --> 1:24:01.38
赫尔曼，我只是不明白这一点 这是怎么回事？

1910
1:24:01.47 --> 1:24:07.30
我们转移视线，制造混乱 然后我们整理一下逃出去

1911
1:24:11.60 --> 1:24:12.77
嘿，尤拉

1912
1:24:14.06 --> 1:24:16.44
- 你有毯子吗？ - 有

1913
1:24:16.52 --> 1:24:19.98
被子，枕头，被褥

1914
1:24:20.07 --> 1:24:21.53
拿到这里

1915
1:24:23.57 --> 1:24:26.66
奥列格，什么事？

1916
1:24:26.74 --> 1:24:28.74
放心，没什么

1917
1:24:28.83 --> 1:24:32.91
嗯，这样。你们先走 我在这里再搜一会

1918
1:24:33.00 --> 1:24:36.04
噢，上帝！这里已经我们走遍了！

1919
1:24:36.12 --> 1:24:38.54
奥列格，这里什么都没有

1920
1:24:38.63 --> 1:24:41.42
特种部队会找到他们 他们甚至不会让你接近的

1921
1:24:41.51 --> 1:24:44.22
我们想都留下来 但这里没有什么我们可做的

1922
1:24:44.30 --> 1:24:46.47
我们已经把他们赶到死胡同里了 让勇士抓他们

1923
1:24:46.55 --> 1:24:47.72
你为什么要留下来？

1924
1:24:47.80 --> 1:24:51.68
不知道。要亲眼看着他们被 当场抓住，以防万一。

1925
1:24:51.77 --> 1:24:53.47
- 你知道…  - 什么？

1926
1:24:54.27 --> 1:24:55.43
这是命令

1927
1:24:56.48 --> 1:24:58.56
这一次听我的 所有人把装备都给我！

1928
1:25:04.32 --> 1:25:05.49
谢谢

1929
1:25:08.41 --> 1:25:11.53
现在就走，三亚，哈姆雷特

1930
1:25:21.99 --> 1:25:26.59
这是约翰先生，这是彼得罗维奇将军 莫斯科行动指挥部总指挥

1931
1:25:27.32 --> 1:25:28.52
恭喜！将军

1932
1:25:29.07 --> 1:25:31.77
我从今早就期待着这一刻

1933
1:25:32.12 --> 1:25:33.12
极其高明

1934
1:25:35.12 --> 1:25:36.12
谢谢

1935
1:25:47.43 --> 1:25:54.23
我刚才和卡佳小姐说 这是一件大事，非常棒的

1936
1:25:55.33 --> 1:25:56.37
他说了什么？

1937
1:25:57.46 --> 1:25:59.71
他说我们的节目非常好

1938
1:25:59.79 --> 1:26:02.59
他要购买专利然后生产

1939
1:26:02.67 --> 1:26:06.92
他的开价是5万欧元

1940
1:26:07.01 --> 1:26:09.26
两国间的贸易额会增加百分之一

1941
1:26:09.34 --> 1:26:12.97
我们需要考虑一下 我们可能会有更多这样的优惠

1942
1:26:13.06 --> 1:26:15.81
尤其是晚上，收视率会上升

1943
1:26:17.02 --> 1:26:19.31
翻译：“这不是市场。”

1944
1:26:22.51 --> 1:26:26.11
谢谢，马特迪斯先生 将军要考虑一下你的出价

1945
1:26:37.16 --> 1:26:39.66
一小时过去了 这种情况并没有改变

1946
1:26:39.75 --> 1:26:44.54
警方发言人称：“这是等待的行动阶段。”

1947
1:26:44.63 --> 1:26:50.80
他们正试图与匪徒进行联系 并让他们释放人质

1948
1:27:00.02 --> 1:27:02.10
- 把摄像机关了！  - 把手举起来！

1949
1:27:15.95 --> 1:27:20.91
他们可能再次使用了榴弹发射器！ 这是现场直播

1950
1:27:21.00 --> 1:27:22.42
这就是你的节目？

1951
1:27:23.08 --> 1:27:25.75
难道这就是你想给全国展示的节目？

1952
1:27:27.38 --> 1:27:29.67
你丢了我的脸！

1953
1:27:29.76 --> 1:27:32.17
等等，这个节目还未结束

1954
1:27:32.26 --> 1:27:36.89
- 新画面的制作现已接近尾声  - 节目？什么节目？

1955
1:27:36.97 --> 1:27:40.56
你难道不明白吗？这里有人死了！

1956
1:27:40.64 --> 1:27:43.35
你被撤了。上校！

1957
1:27:44.06 --> 1:27:47.15
这些平民在这里干什么？

1958
1:27:47.23 --> 1:27:49.11
把他们赶到一个安全的地方。清楚吗？

1959
1:27:49.19 --> 1:27:52.07
开始向房间突击。跑步！快！

1960
1:27:52.15 --> 1:27:53.70
- 遵命  - 你可以离开了

1961
1:28:17.35 --> 1:28:20.26
停下！他们有手榴弹

1962
1:28:21.56 --> 1:28:23.35
5个和7个，押着他们，不要开枪

1963
1:28:23.44 --> 1:28:27.40
第二组出来了。撤！撤！

1964
1:28:27.48 --> 1:28:29.44
冷静，小心，退后

1965
1:28:29.52 --> 1:28:34.61
这可能是人质。撤！撤！

1966
1:28:37.99 --> 1:28:42.16
不要让他们走。快！快！

1967
1:28:46.37 --> 1:28:48.29
他们正进入电梯

1968
1:28:48.38 --> 1:28:51.50
小心点，32号，在楼下右手边的电梯等他们

1969
1:28:51.59 --> 1:28:53.67
我们将带他们下楼梯

1970
1:29:00.60 --> 1:29:03.47
检查左侧电梯！ 里面还有人！

1971
1:29:15.07 --> 1:29:16.32
手榴弹！

1972
1:29:22.29 --> 1:29:23.87
有人受伤吗？

1973
1:29:24.79 --> 1:29:25.87
我是人质！

1974
1:30:11.59 --> 1:30:12.84
把他带走！

1975
1:30:15.09 --> 1:30:16.80
赶时间吗？

1976
1:30:19.93 --> 1:30:22.55
我打算做的已经做完了

1977
1:30:24.39 --> 1:30:25.43
令人钦佩

1978
1:30:27.93 --> 1:30:29.60
我已经没有价值了

1979
1:30:36.36 --> 1:30:38.69
所有人撤离！撤！

1980
1:30:39.99 --> 1:30:45.20
不要开枪！不要开枪！ 我们是人质！

1981
1:30:49.54 --> 1:30:51.33
我是人质！

1982
1:33:03.88 --> 1:33:07.18
您正在收听是玛雅克电台 生命在继续！

1983
1:33:07.26 --> 1:33:12.89
生命在继续，我们在切尔塔诺夫北边报告

1984
1:33:12.97 --> 1:33:16.85
营救人质的工作正在进行 并正在录像中

1985
1:33:16.94 --> 1:33:19.19
之后你可以在电视上观看

1986
1:33:19.27 --> 1:33:22.11
这些技术你都有，但警方会将 他们不喜欢的展现出来吗？

1987
1:33:22.19 --> 1:33:24.69
卡佳，所有都结束了

1988
1:33:24.78 --> 1:33:28.45
所有的罪犯被抓获或被击毙 人质全部活了下来

1989
1:33:33.29 --> 1:33:37.25
- 退后！退后！  - 拜托，就一会儿！

1990
1:33:49.76 --> 1:33:52.68
两具尸体在顶楼 一具在地下室

1991
1:33:52.76 --> 1:33:55.52
两人被俘，一人失踪。

1992
1:34:16.87 --> 1:34:18.04
是你啊，少校？

1993
1:34:19.12 --> 1:34:22.04
厌倦了从我手下那里逃跑了吗？ 出来喘口气？

1994
1:34:22.13 --> 1:34:25.21
审查你有的是时间！

1995
1:34:25.30 --> 1:34:28.22
就这样，斯米尔诺夫 我不会再帮你擦屁股

1996
1:34:28.30 --> 1:34:31.01
正式审查结果会送到检察官那儿

1997
1:34:31.09 --> 1:34:32.64
现在你的命运由他掌握！

1998
1:34:33.51 --> 1:34:35.47
甚至不要再联系我！

1999
1:34:35.56 --> 1:34:37.22
我已经受够你了！

2000
1:34:37.31 --> 1:34:40.19
你知道我对你的看法 我在跟你说话！总是扮英雄

2001
1:36:26.63 --> 1:36:28.25
- 开车！  - 去哪里？

2002
1:36:28.34 --> 1:36:30.55
往前开！

2003
1:36:41.85 --> 1:36:43.39
停！停！

2004
1:36:45.98 --> 1:36:49.44
- 救命！  - 对不起，我马上就还给你！

2005
1:36:50.98 --> 1:36:53.15
混蛋！ 屁眼！

2006
1:37:17.30 --> 1:37:20.01
你真人比电视上漂亮多了

2007
1:37:22.93 --> 1:37:24.98
你的男朋友是个幸运的家伙

2008
1:37:26.14 --> 1:37:27.73
我没有男朋友

2009
1:37:31.02 --> 1:37:33.57
你的女朋友真倒霉

2010
1:37:35.45 --> 1:37:38.41
现在你的处境很不利

2011
1:37:39.87 --> 1:37:41.37
我还是单身

2012
1:37:47.04 --> 1:37:48.33
哦，上帝！

2013
1:37:57.72 --> 1:37:59.64
他是个真正勇敢的警察

2014
1:38:00.68 --> 1:38:01.72
他是个白痴！

2015
1:38:01.80 --> 1:38:03.22
我尊重有勇气的人

2016
1:38:04.35 --> 1:38:07.02
你应该改成尊重智力

2017
1:38:07.10 --> 1:38:09.27
难道你还希望能逃脱？

2018
1:38:10.36 --> 1:38:13.61
不要抱高希望 你现在是个电视明星

2019
1:38:16.69 --> 1:38:18.70
你是怎么开车的？

2020
1:38:18.78 --> 1:38:21.99
难道你没看见标志吗？ 我要叫交警来

2021
1:39:22.84 --> 1:39:24.51
坐下

2022
1:39:30.31 --> 1:39:32.02
这样比较好

2023
1:39:51.16 --> 1:39:52.71
我们要去哪里？

2024
1:39:53.75 --> 1:39:56.79
为什么你还不放弃？

2025
1:39:57.38 --> 1:40:00.09
这对我们彼此都有利

2026
1:40:01.80 --> 1:40:05.97
该节目已超过了很长时间 他们要杀了你

2027
1:40:06.05 --> 1:40:07.43
你说节目？

2028
1:40:07.51 --> 1:40:09.77
那么，在你的节目中我是扮演个坏蛋？

2029
1:40:10.35 --> 1:40:12.14
坏蛋的结局不都是被杀吗？

2030
1:40:12.89 --> 1:40:15.52
- 你扮演谁？  - 我是导演

2031
1:40:15.61 --> 1:40:18.02
那么为什么没人让我看看剧本？

2032
1:40:25.99 --> 1:40:27.62
节目？

2033
1:40:27.70 --> 1:40:30.62
节目奉献给完成使命的人们

2034
1:42:09.72 --> 1:42:12.93
在你们开始问问题之前…

2035
1:42:13.01 --> 1:42:16.47

和其他部门的协调，战术应用…

2043
1:42:54.64 --> 1:42:59.52
