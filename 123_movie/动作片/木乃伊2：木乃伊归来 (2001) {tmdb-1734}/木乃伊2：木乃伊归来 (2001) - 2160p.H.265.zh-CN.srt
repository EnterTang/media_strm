1
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,770
Five thousand years ago,

2
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,940
a fierce warrior known as the Scorpion King...

3
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,980
led a great army on a campaign to conquer the known world.

4
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,200
After a vicious campaign which lasted seven long years,

5
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,930
the Scorpion King and his army were defeated...

6
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,170
and driven deep into the sacred desert of Ahm Shere.

7
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,090
One by one, they slowly perished under the scorching sun...

8
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,970
until only the great warrior himself was left alive.

9
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,550
Near death,

10
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,050
the Scorpion King made a pact with the dark god Anubis...

11
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,150
that if Anubis would spare his life and let him conquer his enemies,

12
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,650
he would give him his soul.

13
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,430
Anubis accepted his offer and spared his life.

14
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,560
Anubis gave the Scorpion King command of his army,

15
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,500
and like an evil flood, they washed away all that lay before them.

16
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,790
When his task was done

17
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,190
Anubis forced the Scorpion King to serve him for all time.

18
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,540
His army was returned to the sands from whence they came,

19
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,740
where they wait, silently, to be awakened once again.

20
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,740
Alex?

21
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,950
What were you thinking, a mummy had come back to life?

22
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,150
I'll tell you a story some time.

23
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,850
What are you doing down here? I told you to wait for us up in the temple.

24
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,720
-But, Dad, I saw...
-No "buts." It's dangerous down here, Alex.

25
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,520
-But I saw your tattoo.
-You saw what?

26
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,120
On a wall by the entrance. There's a cartouche just like it.

27
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,100
With the pyramid and the eye and the two kings and everything.

28
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,990
-Really?
-Yeah.

29
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,770
Okay, well, I'll be up to take a look at that in a minute.

30
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,280
In the meantime, I want you to wait for us up there. But... But...

31
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,170
No, pick up your stuff, and I'll see you up in the temple.

32
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,870
Go.

33
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,710
Go on.

34
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,810
And... And what shall I do?

35
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,650
I don't know. Surprise me.

36
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,450
Build a better mousetrap.

37
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,390
Okay.

38
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,480
While your mother goes and desecrates another tomb.

39
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,510
Go away.

40
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,310
Those are poisonous, you know.

41
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,170
Only if they bite you.

42
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,940
What was all that about?

43
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,910
Oh, nothing. Alex wanted to show me something.

44
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,250
I swear,

45
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,320
the kid gets more and more like you every day.

46
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,330
What, you mean more attractive, sweet and...

47
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,920
devilishly charming?

48
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,090
No, he's driving me crazy.

49
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,060
Now, where were we?

50
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,360
Hammer and chisel.

51
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,470
All right, all right! Let's do it your way.

52
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,530
Thank you.

53
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,460
Ever since I had that dream,

54
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,060
this place is all I can think about.

55
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,430
Ever since you had that dream, I haven't had a decent night of sleep.

56
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,140
I feel like I've been here before.

57
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,540
I know I've been here before.

58
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,010
Evy, nobody's been here before. Not in at least 3,000 years.

59
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,410
Except for these guys.

60
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,550
Then how do I seem to know exactly where I'm going?

61
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,130
Let's go.

62
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,840
Knock, knock. Anybody home?

63
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,050
You two check out that stuff, see if it's there.

64
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,640
I'll sort out the O'Connells.

65
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,380
You know, if you move that fast enough, you can almost write your name.

66
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,580
I just had a vision.

67
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,840
It was... It was like my dream, but it was real.

68
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,090
It was like I was actually here in ancient times.

69
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,320
Well, if you actually were here, could you show me how to open this thing?

70
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,460
Hold this.

71
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,420
All right, now you're starting to scare me.

72
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,920
Now I'm starting to scare myself.

73
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,750
What is this? Look at the state of this rubbish.

74
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,020
Those Egyptians never had a clue.

75
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,090
It's all chintz and stuff. Look at that.

76
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,260
Cheap pottery, this. Ancient rubbish.

77
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,460
Jacques, something's hit me head!

78
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,630
Shut up, Spivey.

79
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,440
This place is cursed.

80
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,870
We do not want to wake the gods.

81
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,460
That's the emblem of the Scorpion King.

82
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,170
He's supposed to be pure myth.

83
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,900
No... No trace of him has ever been found before.

84
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,970
No artifacts, no archival evidence.

85
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,040
Maybe they didn't want anybody to find him.

86
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,880
Let's open this.

87
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,750
Evy, I don't have a real good feeling about this.

88
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,340
It's only a chest. No harm ever came from opening a chest.

89
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,690
Right, and no harm ever came from reading a book. Remember how that went?

90
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,490
We can't stop now.

91
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,890
Just remember, I was the voice of reason here.

92
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,990
For once.

93
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,890
Rubbish.

94
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,000
Dreck. Chintz. Only half of this...

95
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,700
God, that hurt!

96
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,060
Hon? Let's do it your way.

97
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,870
The bracelet of Anubis.

98
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,930
I'll take care of this.

99
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,790
Oh, my God.

100
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,900
It's a bit late for that!

101
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,600
Put it in your rucksack.

102
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,230
I got a better idea. Let's leave it here.

103
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,070
I think it's a bit late for that!

104
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,970
What's it say?

105
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,040
"He who disturbs this bracelet shall drink from the Nile."

106
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,850
That doesn't sound too bad.

107
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,440
Jacques's gonna make a nice fillet out of you, my son.

108
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,270
Oh, please. Please.

109
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,070
Spivey! Jacques! Let's get the hell outta here!

110
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,210
Come on!

111
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,580
This is bad, Evy!

112
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,210
We've had bad before! This is worse!

113
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,380
Mom, Dad, I can explain everything.

114
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,450
The Book of the Dead gives life.

115
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,350
And the Book of the Living...

116
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,790
takes life away.

117
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,130
I thought that was my job.

118
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,260
We're getting close.

119
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,460
Did you acquire it?

120
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,060
We're getting very close.

121
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,390
We've found him.

122
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,220
We've found him! We've found him!

123
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,710
Step aside here. Out of the way!

124
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,620
Imhotep.

125
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,320
It's him. It's Imhotep.

126
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,060
Now we must raise those that serve him.

127
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,220
Get out of my way.

128
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,060
Get out of my way, or I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

129
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,540
He means it. He shot someone before.

130
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,800
Give it to me.

131
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,040
Opportunity passed us by.

132
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,830
We need that bracelet.

133
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,840
And we need it before it opens.

134
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,650
Enough.

135
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,320
My dear Hafez,

136
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,490
I told you I should have handled it.

137
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,230
I told you I should have handled it. I did not want your past history to cloud the issue.

138
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,560
We know where it is. We'll take care of it.

139
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,860
No, we'll take care of it.

140
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,130
I have a different chore for you now.

141
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,870
Where is the bracelet?

142
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,070
It's on its way to merry old London.

143
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,440
Then London is where we must go.

144
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,800
I think the bracelet is some sort of guide to the lost oasis of Ahm Shere.

145
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,570
Evy, I know what you're thinking,

146
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,400
and the answer is no.

147
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,770
We just got home.

148
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,510
That's the beauty of it. We're already packed.

149
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,140
Why don't you just give me one good reason.

150
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,410
It's just an oasis,

151
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,480
darling.

152
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,090
A beautiful,

153
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,290
exciting,

154
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,950
romantic...

155
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,930
oasis.

156
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,830
The kind with the white, sandy beach and the palm trees...

157
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,430
and the cool, clear, blue water and...

158
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,340
We could have some of those big drinks with the little umbrellas.

159
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,340
Sounds good.

160
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,820
Sounds too good. What's the catch?

161
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,350
Supposedly it's the resting place of Anubis's army.

162
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,890
See? I knew there's a catch.

163
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,690
There's always a catch. And let me guess.

164
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,660
It was commanded by that Scorpion King guy?

165
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,960
Yes, but he only awakens once every 5,000 years.

166
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,400
Right. And if someone doesn't kill him, he's gonna wipe out the world.

167
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,400
How did you know?

168
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,560
I didn't. But that's always the story.

169
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,630
The last known expedition to actually reach Ahm Shere

170
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,270
was sent by Ramses the Fourth over 3,000 years ago.

171
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,780
He sent over a thousand men.

172
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,280
And none of them was ever seen again.

173
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,370
-How did you know?
-I didn't. But that's always the story.

174
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,610
-Did I mention there was a pyramid of gold?
-Twice.

175
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,350
Alexander the Great sent troops in search of it.

176
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,940
-Hooray for him.
-So did Caesar.

177
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,990
-Yeah, look what happened to his career.
-And Napoleon.

178
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,350
But we're smarter than him. And taller too.

179
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,190
Exactly. That's why we're gonna find it.

180
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,160
Because we're taller?

181
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,060
That's why I love you.

182
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,630
Nice try.

183
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,540
Mom!

184
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,120
What do I do with this chest?

185
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,220
This sucker weighs a goddang ton.

186
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,160
Alex, watch your language!

187
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,150
Rather weighty, this.

188
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,970
Evy, that first weird dream of yours was exactly six weeks ago, right?

189
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,100
I think so, yes. But what's that got to do with anything?

190
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,850
It just happens to coincide with Egyptian New Year.

191
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,890
That's right. What a coincidence.

192
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,250
Maybe.

193
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,630
All I'm saying is, let's be cautious.

194
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,900
If anything happened to you, I would never forgive myself.

195
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,160
You and Alex are the only thing that matter to me.

196
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,490
Well,

197
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,300
the Bembridge scholars have been begging me...

198
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,460
to run the British Museum.

199
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,620
cripes, how do you get this thing off?

200
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,790
Have I kissed you today?

201
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,100
I hate it when you do that.

202
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,570
Why?

203
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,470
Makes me feel like agreeing to anything.

204
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,530
-Anything?
-Mm-hmm.

205
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,810
Those knickers are not mine.

206
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,110
Jonathan.

207
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,920
Hey, Alex, behave yourself for five minutes.

208
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,990
You betcha.

209
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,500
Happy to be home?

210
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,130
Couldn't be happier.

211
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,370
It's the year of the scorpion.

212
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,010
-Neat!
-Thought you might like that.

213
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,440
So then I killed the mummy and all his minions and stole his scepter.

214
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,010
Oh, you're so brave.

215
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,420
And rich. Did I mention rich?

216
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,350
What do you think I'm doing here?

217
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,020
Sorry. We must be in the wrong house.

218
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,860
You said this was your house.

219
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,290
-No, I didn't.
-Call me!

220
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,590
-You're not Sheila's husband, are you?
-No.

221
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,340
Look, if you work forJohnny, I was gonna pay him back on Tuesday.

222
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,500
I don't know any Johnny.

223
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,040
We are looking for the bracelet of Anubis.

224
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,480
Oh, good for you. Good thing to have, the old bracelet of Anubis.

225
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,640
Where is it?

226
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,440
you're looking here for the bracelet. I see.

227
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,820
I have no idea what you're talking about.

228
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,010
Mr. O'Connell, you try my patience.

229
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,280
Mr. O'Connell? No, hold on a minute. You've got the wrong ma...

230
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,920
That bracelet. Now I remember. I lost it in a card game.

231
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,590
For your sake, I hope not.

232
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,390
It can't be.

233
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,170
Where's your wife?

234
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,210
My wife? Oh,you mean Evy.

235
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,080
I think she went off to Baden-Baden or Tibet or something.

236
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,280
The girl's a free spirit. Did I mention I was single now?

237
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,230
Egyptian asps are quite poisonous.

238
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,760
It's downstairs.

239
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:51,330
There's a safe. The combination is, uh, uh, 3-20-58...

240
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,970
3-9-3-something.

241
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,940
It's in a safe downstairs.

242
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,630
I told you. I told you!

243
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,770
And your point is?

244
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,710
My point is, I told you so you wouldn't kill me.

245
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,980
When did we make that arrangement?

246
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,420
Jonathan, I thought I said no more wild parties.

247
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,090
Well, when you're popular...

248
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,200
Alex, I'm serious. If you've lost that key, you're grounded.

249
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,260
I haven't lost it. I just can't find it. There's a difference.

250
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,970
Well, you'd better start finding it then.

251
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,640
I will, Mom. There's nothing to worry about.

252
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,510
Good evening.

253
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,510
Who are you? What are you doing here?

254
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,980
I'm looking for the chest, of course.

255
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,620
Give it to me now.

256
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,590
Get out of my house.

257
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,130
Whoa, Mom. Maybe not the best idea.

258
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,290
Alex, get back there.

259
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,500
Definitely not the best idea.

260
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,940
I think it's time to yell for Dad now.

261
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,530
Now I will kill you and take it anyway.

262
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,970
I think not.

263
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,010
Ardeth, what are you doing here?

264
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,290
Perhaps explanations are best kept for later.

265
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,950
Ardeth Bay.

266
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,050
Lock-Nah.

267
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,490
Knowing my brother-in-law, he probably deserves whatever you're about to do to him,

268
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,120
but this is my house, I have certain rules about snakes and dismemberment.

269
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,200
Shoot him!

270
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:58,830
Whoa, Mom!

271
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,270
When did you learn to do that?

272
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,730
I have no idea.

273
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,030
That I learned from your father.

274
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,240
I'll take that.

275
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,490
Not bad for a Medjai.

276
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,590
Let go!

277
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,580
-What's in the chest?
-The bracelet of Anubis!

278
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,560
They must not get the bracelet!

279
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,160
Get it and get out of here!

280
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,200
Mom, look out!

281
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,970
Evelyn!

282
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,370
Mom!

283
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,480
Jonathan!

284
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,110
Jonathan!

285
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,190
What'd you do this time?

286
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,790
I haven't done anything to anybody!

287
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,430
-Lately.
-Come on!

288
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,180
Rick!

289
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:06,990
Evelyn!

290
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,790
Look out, Rick!

291
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,400
Dad! Dad!

292
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,540
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. Yeah? Okay.

293
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,470
O'Connell.

294
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,810
-What are you doing here?
-No, scratch that. I don't care.

295
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,010
Who are those guys? Where are they taking my wife?

296
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,720
My friend, I'm not sure,

297
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,590
but wherever this man is...

298
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,850
your wife will surely be.

299
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,360
Hey, I know him. He's the curator. He works at the British Museum.

300
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,230
Are you sure?

301
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,290
Believe him. He spends more time there than at home.

302
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,340
You're here, the bad guys are here, Evy's been kidnapped. Let me guess...

303
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,180
Yes, they once again removed the creature from his grave.

304
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,480
I don't mean to point fingers, but isn't it your job to make sure that doesn't happen?

305
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:07,010
That woman who was with him, she knows things that no living person could possibly know.

306
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,520
She knew exactly where the creature was buried.

307
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,680
We were hoping she would lead us to the bracelet. She obviously did.

308
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,060
And now they have it.

309
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,800
I wouldn't get too nervous just yet.

310
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,060
Is that gold?

311
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,530
When I stuck it on, I saw the pyramids at Giza.

312
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,500
Then, whoosh! Straight across the desert to Karnak.

313
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,510
By putting this on, you have started a chain reaction that could bring the next apocalypse.

314
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,180
-You, lighten up.
-You, big trouble.

315
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,110
You, get in the car.

316
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,220
I am sorry if I alarmed your son, but you must understand,

317
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:47,190
now that the bracelet is on his wrist, we have only seven days before the Scorpion King awakens.

318
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,660
We? What we?

319
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,530
If he is not killed, he will raise the army of Anubis.

320
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,860
I take it that's not a good thing.

321
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,560
Oh, he'll wipe out the world.

322
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,900
The old "wipe out the world" ploy.

323
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,010
Whomever can kill the Scorpion King...

324
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,010
can send his army back to the Underworld...

325
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,840
or use it to destroy mankind and rule the Earth.

326
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,110
That's why they dug up Imhotep. He's the only guy tough enough to take out the Scorpion King.

327
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,350
That is their plan.

328
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,630
Alex, I've got a big job for you. Stay here and protect the car.

329
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,030
-I can do that.
-Protect the car?

330
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:35,070
Come on Dad, Just because I'm a kid doesn't mean I'm stupid.

331
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,830
I know.

332
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,300
Dad!

333
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,280
If you see anyone come out screaming, it's just me.

334
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,810
Maybe you should stay here and watch him.

335
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,250
Yes, now you're talking.

336
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,450
You want the shotgun?

337
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,320
No, I prefer the Thompson.

338
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,960
If I were to say to you,

339
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,770
I'm a stranger traveling from the east, seeking that which is lost...

340
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,170
Then I would reply that I am a stranger traveling from the west.

341
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,040
It is I whom you seek. How...

342
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,840
Then it is true.

343
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,970
-You have the sacred mark.
-What, that?

344
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,510
No, that got slapped on me in an orphanage in Cairo.

345
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,080
That mark means you're a protector of man,

346
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,190
a warrior for God, a Medjai.

347
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:25,120
Sorry. You've got the wrong guy.

348
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,740
Mr. Hafez.

349
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,600
They found him.

350
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,710
Imhotep.

351
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,110
Do not be frightened.

352
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,140
I am not afraid.

353
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,600
You know,

354
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,310
a couple of years ago, this would've seemed really strange to me.

355
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,390
Lord Imhotep will be much pleased.

356
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,260
Where is it?

357
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,460
Where is the bracelet?

358
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,370
I think I know.

359
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,180
At the very top of the gold pyramid, there was a huge diamond.

360
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,470
Huge? How huge?

361
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:43,610
It was so big, it would reflect the sun

362
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,910
and wink at distant travelers,

363
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,150
beckoning them to their deaths.

364
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,270
Get... No! Get off!

365
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,240
Oh, my God.

366
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,050
You wait!

367
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,510
I'll put you in your grave again!

368
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,820
Our thinking was, not if we put you in your grave first.

369
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,820
Burn her!

370
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,020
You bast...

371
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,900
-Open it! Open it!
-I'm trying, I'm trying!

372
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,390
-Hurry up!
-Come on, come on, come on!

373
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,430
-You broke it, you broke it, you broke it!
-Be quiet, Alex!

374
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,800
If there's gonna be hysterics, they'll come from me!

375
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,540
Go, go, go, go!

376
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,660
Oh, no. Not these guys again.

377
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,880
What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?

378
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,750
You're asking me? I'm only eight years old!

379
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,800
Honey, what you doin'? These guys don't use doors.

380
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:49,860
Where the hell's Jonathan?

381
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,000
Alex! What's the matter with my car?

382
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,670
I was forced to find an alternative means of transportation.

383
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,110
-A double-decker bus?
-It was his idea!

384
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,380
-Was not!
-Was too!

385
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,110
Just go!

386
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,880
-It was too!
-Was not!

387
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,530
No, no! Not my car!

388
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:31,240
Oh, I hate mummies.

389
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,770
Glad to see me now?

390
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,510
Just like old times, huh?

391
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,580
Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn!

392
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,830
No! Get out of the way!

393
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,000
Look out!

394
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,030
Great driving, Uncle Jon.

395
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,120
Yeah.

396
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,500
You all right?

397
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,430
This was... my first bus ride.

398
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,150
What would I do without you?

399
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,120
Are all librarians this much trouble?

400
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,780
Jeez, get a room.

401
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,830
Let me go!

402
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,190
-Silence!
-Stop!

403
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:54,970
Go!

404
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,630
Stop!

405
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,800
Alex.

406
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:44,170
Please, do not fear for your son, my friends.

407
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,850
They cannot hurt him, for he wears the bracelet of Anubis.

408
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,680
Alex is wearing the bracelet?

409
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,920
When he put it on, he said he saw the pyramids at Giza, the temple at Karnak.

410
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,390
And when they reach Karnak, the bracelet will show him the next step of the journey.

411
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,730
If we don't get to Karnak before them, we won't have any idea where to look for him next.

412
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:03,530
Seems to me

413
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,300
like we need a magic carpet.

414
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,920
When Lord Imhotep last encountered the O'Connells,

415
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:30,620
they sent his immortal soul to the Underworld.

416
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:34,860
As powerful as he will become, he is still vulnerable.

417
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:38,930
Only with the army of Anubis will he be invincible.

418
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,570
He will need your help.

419
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,470
Keep this with you always.

420
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,170
The Book of the Dead!

421
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,540
What a bright little child.

422
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:58,550
Your mother must be missing you terribly.

423
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,120
If you wish to see her again, you'd better behave.

424
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,790
Lady, I don't behave for my parents.

425
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,830
What makes you think I'm going to do it for you?

426
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:06,900
Silence!

427
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:10,770
Because your parents wouldn't slip poisonous snakes into your bed...

428
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,660
while you were sleeping.

429
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,600
Lord Imhotep wishes to meet the boy.

430
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,370
Now we shall see how brave you are.

431
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,140
Watch the suit! Hey!

432
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,450
Ow! Me fingers!

433
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,040
Nice.

434
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,190
Very nice.

435
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,320
Did you acquire what we asked?

436
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,760
Oh, we acquired it, all right.

437
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,260
You know what?

438
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,670
We had to kill two of those guards at the mausoleum... to acquire it.

439
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,140
This chest is cursed.

440
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,710
It says there is one,

441
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,380
the undead,

442
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,810
who will kill all those who open this chest.

443
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,750
Yes, yes, and the creature will suck them dry, then become whole again.

444
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,840
We've all heard this story before.

445
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,290
Yeah, but I heard the yanks who found it nine years ago all died.

446
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,720
Horrible deaths, they were.

447
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,150
So, with that in mind...

448
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,780
We want ten.

449
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,880
Quiet!

450
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,160
The agreement was for five.

451
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,030
Yeah, well, we want ten, or we'll take it elsewhere.

452
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,660
-If you...
-Ten will be just fine.

453
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,170
Follow me, gentlemen.

454
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,530
Get in.

455
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,870
it is you who are the chosen one,

456
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:54,830
you who will take me to Ahm Shere.

457
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:59,070
What if I don't? What if I get a little... lost?

458
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,910
You have strength, little one.

459
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:08,980
You are your father's son. But I know something you don't.

460
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,680
This bracelet is a gift

461
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,290
and a curse.

462
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,660
The sands of time...

463
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,930
have already begun to pour against you.

464
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,090
Yeah,yeah. I already heard this part.

465
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,830
From the minute I put the bracelet on,

466
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:30,900
seven days do I have before the Scorpion King wakes up.

467
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:36,000
Did you also hear that if you do not enter the pyramid before the sun strikes it on that very morning...

468
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,480
that the bracelet will suck the life out of you?

469
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,480
That part I missed.

470
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,760
Hey, wait a minute. That means I've only got five days left.

471
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:49,360
Then I believe it will be best if we do not get lost. Don't you?

472
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,690
My dad is going to kick your ass.

473
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,860
I do not think so.

474
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:10,780
In here, gentlemen, you shall receive your just rewards.

475
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,340
No tricks now, woman.

476
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,450
We're not givin' up this chest till we're satisfied.

477
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,620
Oh, don't worry. There is much satisfaction to be had.

478
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,530
What's going on?

479
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,870
This place... is cursed.

480
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,240
What is it with you and curses?

481
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,940
He ain't happy without a curse.

482
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,740
This is cursed. That is cursed.

483
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,440
Give it a rest, will ya!

484
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,950
Christ!

485
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,590
He wants you to open the chest! Open the chest!

486
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,460
No!

487
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,580
Where'd he go?

488
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:29,490
Where'd he go?

489
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,380
Spivey!

490
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,810
This is the magic carpet?

491
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,740
He'll be fine. He's a professional.

492
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:25,680
Izzy!

493
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,350
He definitely remembers you.

494
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,020
He's a little shy. Jonathan, get our bags.

495
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,590
Oh, my hands are full.

496
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,650
Now.

497
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,260
Right. I'll get the bags.

498
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,490
I'll deal with the flight details.

499
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,730
Honey, you're not a subtle man.

500
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,460
We don't have time for subtle.

501
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,710
Izzy, come here.

502
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,080
Doesn't look happy to see you.

503
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:55,580
Never turned me down yet.

504
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,480
Whatever it is, whatever you need, I don't care. Forget it, O'Connell.

505
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:00,640
Every time I hook up with you, I get shot!

506
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,280
Last time, I got shot in the ass. I'm in mourning for my ass.

507
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:06,580
Remember that bank job in Marrakesh?

508
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,560
Bank job?

509
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,720
It's not like it sounds.

510
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,820
Uh, it's exactly how it sounds.

511
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,360
I'm flying high, hiding in the sun.

512
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,370
The white boy here flags me down, so I fly in low for the pickup.

513
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,490
The next thing you know, I get shot!

514
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:21,000
I'm lying in the middle of the road with my spleen hanging out,

515
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,170
and I see him waltzing up with some belly dancer girl.

516
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,840
Belly dancer girl?

517
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:27,380
Izzy, I think you and I should talk.

518
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,010
As long as I don't get shot.

519
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,680
Quit your whining. You're gonna get paid this time.

520
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,550
O'Connell, have you looked around here any? Huh? What do I need money for?

521
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,890
What the hell am I gonna spend it on?

522
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,590
I'm gonna keep this short. My little boy is out there.

523
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,960
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get him back.

524
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,000
O'Connell, if you give me that gold stick there, you can shave my head,

525
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:57,010
wax my legs and use me for a surfboard.

526
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,080
Didn't we do that in Tripoli?

527
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,910
Say, by the way, when did you... lose your eye?

528
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:08,510
I didn't. I just thought it made me look more dashing.

529
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,210
Come on. Get to work.

530
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:15,250
You're not exactly catching me at my best.

531
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:16,820
Oh, I'm sure I am.

532
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,010
I knew it. I'm gonna get shot.

533
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,570
These are the commanders of the 12 tribes of the Medjai.

534
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:33,640
Horus!

535
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,010
Pet bird.

536
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:42,990
My best and most clever friend.

537
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,280
He will let the commanders know of our progress so that they may follow.

538
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,780
If the Army of Anubis arises,

539
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,280
they will do all they can to stop it.

540
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,720
Rick, are you sure Izzy's reliable?

541
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:15,720
Yeah, yeah, he's reliable-ish.

542
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:21,780
Isn't she beautiful?

543
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:23,630
It's a balloon.

544
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,490
It's a dirigible.

545
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:26,790
Where's your airplane?

546
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,620
Airplanes are a thing of the past.

547
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,930
-Izzy, you were right.
-I was?

548
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:31,970
Yeah. You're gonna get shot.

549
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,830
She's faster than she looks.

550
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,210
And she's quiet. Real quiet.

551
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,270
Perfect for sneaking up on people, which is a very good thing.

552
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,750
Unless, of course, we go with your approach...

553
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:47,280
barging in face-first, guns blazing, and gettin' your friends shot in the ass!

554
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,190
Why can't you people ever keep your feet on the ground?

555
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:43,440
O'Connell does not want to believe, but he flies like Horus towards his destiny.

556
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:47,500
Yes, yes, very interesting. Tell me some more about this gold pyramid.

557
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,240
Well, it is written that since the time of the Scorpion King,

558
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,410
no man who has laid eyes upon it has ever returned to tell the tale.

559
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:56,110
Where is all this stuff written? Hello.

560
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,520
Got it.

561
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,490
Pretty nice, eh?

562
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,130
This is all I have left in the world.

563
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,270
The rest of my fortune was lost...

564
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:13,800
to some rather unscrupulous characters, actually.

565
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:17,580
But if the curator reacted to it the way you say, it must be very important.

566
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,610
If I were you, I would keep it close.

567
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:23,610
My friend, the gods couldn't take this away from me.

568
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,340
-That's mine!
-No, it's not!

569
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,950
Keep your hands off of it.

570
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,430
I want him back, Rick.

571
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:44,100
I want him in my arms.

572
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:45,530
I know.

573
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,240
We taught him well.

574
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,500
He's smarter than you...

575
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,440
and he's tougher than me.

576
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,480
-I love him so much. I just can't...
-I know. We both do,

577
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:00,070
and Alex knows that.

578
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,390
I'll get him back, Evy. I promise.

579
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:05,790
I know you will.

580
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:39,090
-Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
-No. No.

581
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,690
That was amazing! Perfect aim.

582
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:52,700
What are you talking about?

583
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,130
I missed.

584
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,050
I have to go to the bathroom.

585
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,180
Make it quick.

586
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,380
Hurry up.

587
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,590
-Hey, reading material.
-Now!

588
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,830
I can't go when someone's watching.

589
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:04,330
I don't trust you. You'll look.

590
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:15,240
Darn!

591
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,760
Oh, my God!

592
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:23,660
Doesn't anyone around here know how to flush a toilet?

593
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,350
Karnak.

594
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,290
If a man does not embrace his past, he has no future.

595
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:10,330
Look,

596
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:13,360
even if...

597
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,500
I was some sort of sacred Medjai,

598
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,470
what good does that do me now?

599
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,530
It is the missing piece of your heart.

600
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:23,340
If you embrace it, if you accept it, you can do anything.

601
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,010
Sounds great.

602
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,380
Listen. What can we expect from our old friend Imhotep?

603
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:31,090
His powers are returning.

604
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,750
By the time he reaches Ahm Shere, even the Scorpion King won't be able to stop him.

605
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:52,310
Imhotep!

606
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,870
Imhotep.

607
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,570
Anck-su-namun.

608
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:38,680
Evy, I know you haven't exactly been yourself lately with all these dreams and visions...

609
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,450
No, no, they're memories from my previous life.

610
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,360
Honestly, I'm not losing my mind. It all makes perfect sense now.

611
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:46,490
And that's the reason why we found the bracelet?

612
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,590
Exactly. I was its protector.

613
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:50,130
Now do you believe, my friend?

614
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,600
Clearly, you were destined to protect this woman.

615
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:55,940
Right. She's a reincarnated princess, and I'm a warrior for God.

616
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:00,000
And your son leads the way to Ahm Shere. Three sides of the pyramid.

617
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,750
This was all preordained thousands of years ago.

618
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:04,640
And how does the story end?

619
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:07,410
Only the journey's written, not the destination.

620
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,650
Convenient.

621
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,710
How else do you explain Evy's visions?

622
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,580
That it is your son who wears the bracelet?

623
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:15,160
How do you explain your mark?

624
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:16,390
Coincidence.

625
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:21,130
My friend, there is a fine line between coincidence and fate.

626
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,790
Don't even think about it!

627
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:48,630
Hold on there, partner.

628
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,330
When the time comes,

629
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:58,080
I shall truly enjoy killing you.

630
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:01,340
But until that time,

631
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:04,710
you better be a little nicer to me.

632
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:06,110
Now, where's my water?

633
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:12,350
No ice?

634
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:19,660
Make sure he doesn't move!

635
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:52,120
They've gone. We've lost them.

636
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,470
Rick!

637
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:20,490
Alex left us his tie,

638
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:24,750
and he made us a little sand castle.

639
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,320
It's the Temple Island of Philae.

640
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,630
They've gone to Philae. That-a-boy, Alex.

641
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,460
Come on!

642
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:44,350
The great temple of Abu Simbel.

643
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:16,280
That's the Blue Nile down there. We must be out of Egypt by now.

644
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:19,940
In ancient times, all this still belonged to the upper kingdom.

645
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:22,410
The oasis must be around here somewhere.

646
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,180
Don't worry, Evy, we'll find him.

647
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:27,020
He's a smart kid. He'll leave us a sign.

648
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:34,600
-Surprised to see me?
-Aah!

649
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:37,360
Leaving bread crumbs, huh? Huh?

650
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,290
We're in trouble!

651
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:47,400
Horus, fly!

652
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,810
Izzy, come hard right! Starboard! Starboard!

653
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:40,680
Was there a little something you forgot to mention? Hmm?

654
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,390
People?

655
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,150
Ahm Shere.

656
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,290
Right.

657
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:27,170
He's back!

658
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:32,370
Hang on!

659
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:47,850
Well, that's not good.

660
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,320
Hang on!

661
01:20:58,370 --> 01:20:59,360
Mom?

662
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:01,870
Dad?

663
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,120
We're gonna go get my son.

664
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:16,050
Then we're gonna wanna get out of here fast, so make this work, Izzy.

665
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:20,420
No, no, you don't understand, goddamn it. This thing was filled with gas. Not hot air... gas.

666
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:24,190
I need gas to get this thing off the ground. Where am I gonna get gas from around here? Huh?

667
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,790
Bananas? Mangos? Tarzan's ass?

668
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:29,160
Well, maybe I could finagle it to take hot air.

669
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:33,430
But do you know how many cubic meters I'd need? It's too big!

670
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:37,410
If anybody can fill this thing up with hot air, Izzy, it's you.

671
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,350
Come to Daddy.

672
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:49,780
Horus!

673
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:01,030
So, Rick, what's the plan?

674
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:02,830
Let's find some higher ground.

675
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:22,950
Horus!

676
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,260
-I must go.
-Where?

677
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:33,560
-I must let the commanders know where we are.
-You can't go.

678
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,690
If the Army of Anubis arises...

679
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,560
I need you to help me find my son.

680
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,040
Then first, I shall help you.

681
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:45,500
Thank you.

682
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:26,450
Look. Roman legionnaires.

683
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,920
And here. Turn-of-the-century French. Napoleon's troops.

684
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:35,960
What in the name of Anubis did this?

685
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:57,780
You hear that?

686
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:58,910
What?

687
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:00,910
Nothing.

688
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:03,550
Absolutely nothing.

689
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:07,390
My word!

690
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:13,230
I say, chaps, look at this.

691
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:17,060
Shrunken heads. I'd love to know how they do that.

692
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:21,300
Just curious.

693
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:28,580
You any good with that?

694
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:33,280
Three times Fox and Hound's grand champion, I'll have you know. You any good with that?

695
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,510
You'll know soon enough.

696
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:40,150
Because the only way to kill an Anubis warrior is by taking off its head.

697
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:42,420
I'll remember that.

698
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:50,170
Evy, try to remember to, uh...

699
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,900
Just keep it tight in the shoulder and, uh,

700
01:24:56,710 --> 01:24:59,370
lead the target a little bit, and then, uh...

701
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,810
And squeeze the trigger. Don't pull it.

702
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,420
I won't miss.

703
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:47,160
-Pyramid.
-The pyramid.

704
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,030
Cripes, I'm in trouble now.

705
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:53,220
Now may I kill him?

706
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:08,480
-Retrieve that bracelet.
-With pleasure.

707
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:37,940
Something is coming.

708
01:26:58,860 --> 01:26:59,850
Jonathan?

709
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:03,130
That's my husband and my son down there.

710
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,330
Make me proud.

711
01:27:06,410 --> 01:27:08,070
Today's that day, Evy.

712
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:17,540
Where's the boy?

713
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:37,490
The Black Book!

714
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:44,560
Let's go!

715
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,530
There you are!

716
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:20,700
The time has come, my little friend.

717
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:21,630
Let go!

718
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:40,860
Dad!

719
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,730
Alex!

720
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,970
Dad!

721
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,410
Time to remove that bracelet, my good son.

722
01:30:06,290 --> 01:30:07,050
Dad!

723
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:18,330
behind you!

724
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:42,910
Let's go.

725
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:44,880
Thank God for that.

726
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:55,690
The two of you must sacrifice yourselves for me.

727
01:31:56,730 --> 01:31:59,100
You shall be rewarded in heaven!

728
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:15,900
-Mom!
-Alex!

729
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,070
Hey, nice shootin', Tex.

730
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:20,240
What were those creepy little pygmy things?

731
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,720
Just the local natives.

732
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:23,890
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure. It was nothin'.

733
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:27,430
Come on, Mom! Come on! Come on, Dad! We have to get to the pyramid.

734
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:29,260
I have to get the bracelet off now!

735
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:31,390
Oh, leave it on, Alex. Looks good on you.

736
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,660
No, you guys! You don't understand!

737
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:38,400
He told me the bracelet will kill me if I don't get inside the pyramid before the sun hits it!

738
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,530
Today!

739
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,240
Oh, my God.

740
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,870
Time to go!

741
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:49,110
I thought you said it was nothing!

742
01:33:02,130 --> 01:33:03,620
Where's Jonathan?

743
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:17,000
Look! There's a burial ground! We're safe! We're safe!

744
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,980
See those sacred stones? They'll never cross those.

745
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,080
You are sure?

746
01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:21,580
Yes, of course I'm sure!

747
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:38,850
Sorry. My mistake.

748
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:48,800
Wait for me!

749
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:50,640
Hurry up,Jonathan!

750
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:53,140
Wait for me!

751
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:54,430
What's that for?

752
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:56,980
Ah, nothin'. Just a little something in case of an emergency.

753
01:34:14,970 --> 01:34:15,730
Rick.

754
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:21,100
Let's go, Alex!

755
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:33,580
Run! Come on, Alex, faster! Come on!

756
01:34:35,550 --> 01:34:37,850
Dad! The bracelet!

757
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,120
Run! Come on!

758
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:03,910
You know,

759
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:08,240
it's not easy being a... dad.

760
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:12,250
Yeah, but you do it really good.

761
01:35:13,230 --> 01:35:14,350
Thanks.

762
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:36,210
They made it. Thank God.

763
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:39,270
Yes. Great.

764
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:41,220
Fabulous.

765
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:45,590
No!

766
01:35:58,600 --> 01:35:59,330
Evy!

767
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:01,190
Evy!

768
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:13,580
-You're going to be all right. Isn't she, Dad? She's going to be all right.
-She'll be fine.

769
01:36:13,650 --> 01:36:15,120
Just get him... Take him. Take...

770
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:18,320
Mommy's fine. It's okay.

771
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:21,350
Where... Evy... Your mother's gonna be fine, okay?

772
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:25,590
You're real strong. You're gonna make it. You're gonna make it.

773
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:26,990
You're fine.

774
01:36:28,230 --> 01:36:29,560
What do I do?

775
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,070
What do I do, Evy?

776
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:35,840
Take care of Alex.

777
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:41,100
Sweetheart, no.

778
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:44,810
I love you.

779
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:48,250
No, don't... No. No!

780
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,210
Evy? Evy?

781
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,030
Come back, Evy.

782
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:08,230
Come back.

783
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,370
Come back.

784
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:36,950
Stay here.

785
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:13,990
Try to think of it like this, Alex.

786
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:16,990
She's gone to a better place.

787
01:40:17,330 --> 01:40:20,230
-You know, like it says in the good book.
-The book!

788
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:22,130
-What?
-That's it.

789
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:23,670
-That's it.
-That's what?

790
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:26,860
-Come on, Uncle Jon! Come on! Come on! That's it! The book!
-What?

791
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,150
You're too late, O'Connell.

792
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:40,340
I have released the Army of Anubis.

793
01:40:40,990 --> 01:40:45,620
Lord Imhotep shall soon kill the Scorpion King and take command.

794
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:47,850
Not after I get through with him.

795
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:34,600
You realize, of course, that this can only be done by someone who can actually read ancient Egyptian.

796
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:37,470
I don't know about you, but I'm a tad rusty.

797
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:39,840
Now where?

798
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,410
We go right.

799
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,670
How do you know?

800
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:49,340
Basically, "This way to the Scorpion King."

801
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:52,220
Mum taught me.

802
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,520
This just might work.

803
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:31,030
It's time someone taught you a lesson, wench. Come on.

804
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:41,460
This is for my sister.

805
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:32,620
Is that all you've got?

806
01:45:25,170 --> 01:45:26,800
Hurry up, Alex!

807
01:46:21,330 --> 01:46:24,190
Uncle Jon, I don't know what this last symbol is!

808
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:25,590
What's it look like?

809
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:27,660
It's a bird! A stork!

810
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:32,460
I know that one! I know that one!

811
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:34,860
Then what is it?

812
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:40,970
That's it!

813
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:26,920
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?

814
01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:28,820
Oh, my God.

815
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:30,160
Evy! Take Alex.

816
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,950
-Go and help Rick.
-But Mom...

817
01:47:32,330 --> 01:47:34,090
-No "buts," Alex.
-Come on, Alex.

818
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:39,400
I'll be just fine.

819
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:41,400
We did it, Uncle Jon! We did it!

820
01:47:41,470 --> 01:47:43,700
Right, partner. Now, let's go help your dad.

821
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:21,400
Nefertiri.

822
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:24,270
Anck-su-namun.

823
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,290
That's a little something new!

824
01:50:16,830 --> 01:50:18,660
My lord!

825
01:50:20,330 --> 01:50:22,160
Save me! Save me!

826
01:51:47,550 --> 01:51:49,820
Okay, now I'm a believer.

827
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,220
Rick!

828
01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:55,080
Jonathan!

829
01:51:55,930 --> 01:51:56,950
It's a spear!

830
01:51:57,230 --> 01:51:59,750
The gold stick thing... It's a... It's a spear!

831
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:02,870
Really? Doesn't look like a spear!

832
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,590
No! That's because it opens up into one!

833
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:07,470
Yes? And?

834
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:11,570
Jonathan! It opens up into a spear!

835
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:58,590
Rick!

836
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:00,990
Evy?

837
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:09,930
-Twist it! Pull!
-I tried it!

838
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:10,930
Push!

839
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:15,000
Jonathan, quick!

840
01:53:29,290 --> 01:53:32,450
Jonathan, throw it! Kill the Scorpion King!

841
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,550
Send his army back to the Underworld!

842
01:53:35,290 --> 01:53:37,520
Step aside, Alex. I'm a professional.

843
01:53:57,420 --> 01:53:57,970
Rick!

844
01:54:27,850 --> 01:54:28,680
No!

845
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:45,120
Go to hell, and take your friends with you!

846
01:56:01,540 --> 01:56:02,400
Dad!

847
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:21,680
Evy,

848
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:25,360
no! Get out of here! Just get out of here!

849
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,290
No!

850
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:32,990
Mom!

851
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:47,750
Hang on, Rick!

852
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,360
Anck-su-namun!

853
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,900
Anck-su-namun!

854
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,670
Anck-su-namun.

855
01:58:03,860 --> 01:58:04,890
Let's go up!

856
01:58:24,650 --> 01:58:28,520
This whole damn place is gonna get sucked up! Let's move up! Go!

857
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,560
Go, Alex! Come on! Come on!

858
01:58:54,750 --> 01:58:56,340
Rick, we're trapped!

859
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:09,550
Izzy!

860
01:59:09,690 --> 01:59:13,630
Come on! Get your butts moving! Hurry up! Hurry up! I haven't got all day!

861
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:19,870
Go! You're next!

862
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:29,070
Jonathan! Hold on!

863
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:30,240
Pull him up! Pull him up!

864
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:32,310
Pull up! Pull me up!

865
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:38,090
Wait! Wait! Let me down! Let me down!

866
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:39,880
It's not worth your life, you idiot!

867
01:59:39,990 --> 01:59:41,580
Yes, it is! Yes, it is!

868
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:45,320
Right.

869
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:56,160
Pull me up! Pull me up!

870
02:00:15,790 --> 02:00:17,660
O'Connell. You almost got me killed!

871
02:00:17,730 --> 02:00:19,030
At least you didn't get shot.

872
02:00:20,230 --> 02:00:21,220
Izzy!

873
02:00:21,630 --> 02:00:24,500
Thank you! Thank you!

874
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:31,540
O'Connell, who the hell you been messin' with this time? Huh?

875
02:00:31,610 --> 02:00:32,800
Oh, you know, the usual.

876
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:35,870
Mummies, pygmies,

877
02:00:36,350 --> 02:00:38,010
big bugs.

878
02:01:06,910 --> 02:01:08,740
I thought I almost lost you there.

879
02:01:09,910 --> 02:01:11,570
For a moment there, you did.

880
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:15,420
Would you like to know what heaven looks like?

881
02:01:16,950 --> 02:01:17,940
Later

882
02:01:22,390 --> 02:01:24,450
Oh, please!

883
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,690
-That's half mine, you know.
-What?

884
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:30,030
-That's half mine.
-I have no idea what you're talking about.

885
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:32,260
What? You took my gold stick! I know you took my gold stick!

886
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:36,600
I swear on the head of my wife, I have no idea what you're talking about.

887
02:01:36,710 --> 02:01:38,540
You haven't... You ain't got a wife!

888
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:40,940
I don't have your gold stick either!

889
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:24,440
Forever.

890
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:07,040
Will be all right

891
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:13,080
Open your heart, baby Leave with me

892
02:06:13,180 --> 02:06:17,520
Don't be afraid

893
02:06:17,620 --> 02:06:19,890
Forever

894
02:06:22,130 --> 02:06:24,390
Forever

895
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,790
Forever

896
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,270
Forever

897
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:48,610
Forever may not be long enough

898
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:51,120
For our love

899
02:06:53,390 --> 02:06:56,090
Forever

900
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:00,420
Forever

901
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:05,070
Forever

902
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:12,170
Forever

903
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:16,370
Forever may not be long enough

904
02:07:16,510 --> 02:07:20,810
Forever may not be long enough

905
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:23,890
Forever may not be long enough

906
02:07:23,990 --> 02:07:27,290
It might be long enough
