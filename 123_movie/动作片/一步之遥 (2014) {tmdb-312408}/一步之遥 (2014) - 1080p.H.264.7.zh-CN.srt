实力有限，如有错误，请指出及批评。

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,960
这是一场你死我活的游戏

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,360
我的蛇蝎美人你在哪里

5
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,910
我为你准备了一个惊喜

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,780
今晚 你输定了

7
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,870
我可没那么天真

8
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,080
嘿 就是你 请原谅我
Hey, over there, please forgive me

9
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,550
如果我来势太凶
If I'm coming on too strong

10
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,480
暗送秋波太落伍了 但你却大获全胜
Hate to stare but you're winning

11
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,870
我最爱的舞曲节奏已经响起
And they're playing my favorite song

12
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,420
放马过来 再靠近点
So come here a little closer

13
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,160
想和你说说悄悄话
Wanna whisper in your ear

14
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,810
搞清状况 问题是
Make it clear, little question

15
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,110
你对我到底有没有感觉
Wanna know just how you feel

16
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,010
如果我说我的心跳飚速
If I said my heart was beating loud

17
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,390
我们为何不愿离这拥挤的舞池
If we could escape the crowd somehow

18
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,020
要是我说我现在想要得到你
If I said I want your body now

19
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,360
你会欲擒故纵吗
Would you hold it against me?

20
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,140
因为你的感觉就是天堂
Cause you feel like paradise

21
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,490
今晚我需要放松一下
And I need a vacation tonight

22
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,270
所以当我说我渴望得到你时
If I said I want your body now

23
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,070
你会欲擒故纵吗
Would you hold it against me?

24
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,880
嘿 你会想我已经疯了
Hey, you might think that I'm crazy

25
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,380
但你知道我就是你的菜
But you know I'm just your type

26
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,220
我确实有点微醺
I might be a little hazy

27
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,680
但你不可否认
But you just cannot deny

28
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,360
我们磨出火花
There's a spark in between us

29
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,990
当我们在舞池狂欢时
When we're dancing on the floor

30
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,700
我想要更多想要识破
I want more, wanna see it

31
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,130
所以今晚我问你
So I'm asking you tonight

32
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,960
如果我说我的心跳飚速
If I said my heart was beating loud

33
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,430
我们为何不远离这拥挤的舞池
If we could escape the crowd somehow

34
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,920
要是我说我现在想要得到你
If I said I want your body now

35
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,210
你会欲擒故纵吗
Would you hold it against me?

36
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,990
因为你的感觉就是天堂
Cause you feel like paradise

37
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,520
今晚我需要放松一下

40
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,520
当我说我想要得到你
if I said I want your body now

41
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,930
你会欲擒故纵么？
Would you hold it against me?

42
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,240
让我尝点甜头
Gimme something good

43
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,390
我现在就已迫不及待
Don't wanna wait, I want it now

44
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,410
大胆示爱吧
Pop it like a hood

45
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,550
让我知道你的本事
And show me how you work it out

46
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,410
如果我说我的心跳飚速

看起来魅力爆表
Looking so fire hot, a twenty out of ten

60
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,870
我们在舞池中四目相交
I saw you watching me watching you on the floor

61
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,920
快来搭讪别再等待
Hitting me up like "What you waiting for?"

62
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,990
你可以大胆表露心声
It's alright to say you want it

63
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,030
潜入我满脑袋的坏点子里
Get inside my dirty mind

64

火热的视线今晚灼伤我一遍又一遍
Burns like ice the way I bring it again and again and again all night

65
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,920
刚一落拍满屋的性感
The beat just dropped and the room got sexy

66
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,610
你旁若无人紧盯着我
You're watching me like there's no one else around

67
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,960
对我饥渴就像想要糖的孩子
I know you want me like kids want candy

68

73
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,200
他们巴不得我离开他们的视线
They see me on you like they think I'll give it up-up-up

74
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,090
但是老娘也不是省油的灯 不怕

震落当贝斯响起时
Slipping off cause of the bass

89

女人到底是怎么了

441
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,110
早在远古的时候

442
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,420
每个君王就都被她们迷得神魂颠倒

443
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,980
蛇蝎美人

444

埃及艳后

447
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,310
有着绝世美貌 极度诱惑

00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,360
多少男人为其鬼迷心窍不惜一切代价想得到她

449
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,770
印度艳后

450
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,720
用妙曼的舞姿把男人们引入闺房

451
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,870
再诱使他们说出自己的秘密

法国艳后

453
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,750
即使出身贫寒

454
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,370
也会在皇帝面前狐假虎威

455
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,040
强迫臣民来认出她

456
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,280
而现在 是你

457
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,550
和那些蛇蝎美人的传说一样

458
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,290
就算你有着和他们相同的手段

459
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,870
也还是脱离不了最终要灭亡的命运

460
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,660
我为你准备了一个惊喜

461
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:17,110
在我和你说话的时候 应经有一支美男军队整装待发

462
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,430
就算你不在我手里死去

463

我敢保证

464
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,830

469
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,980
我愿为你共赴良宵
Just wanna go that extra mile for you

470
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,680
你感受到我爱的指示
Public display of affection

471
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,430
就好像你我共处一室
Feels like no one else in the room (the room)

472
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,720
我们可以独自享乐
We can get down like theres no one around

473
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,290
我们尽情摇摆 尽情摇摆
