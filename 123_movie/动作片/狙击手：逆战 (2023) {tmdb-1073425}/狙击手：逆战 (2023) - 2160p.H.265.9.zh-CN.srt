5
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,980
战场上最致命的武器  狙击手
He's the deadliest weapon on the battlefield-- the sniper.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,980
一旦目标锁定  绝无闪失
Once you've hunted man, nothing else matters.

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,560
无处可藏
There is nowhere to hide.

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,960
如果我们经过观察
If we are looking at you,

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,900
判定你是危险份子
and you have deemed yourself a bad guy,

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,580
那么你必死无疑
we're going to be there to kill you.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,470
从越南战争到史上最远射程的狙击
From Vietnam to the longest kill shot in history.

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,600
他们以为自己能侥幸生还  可惜想错了
They thought that day was their lucky day, but it wasn't.

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,450
狙击手带来世上的终极射击
The world's most extreme shots

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,410
狙击手的信条是
executed by men who live the sniper's creed:

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,420
一枪毙命
"One shot One kill."

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,300
狙击手

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:52,710
狙击手

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,710
狙击手

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:01:00,430
狙击手

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:00,430
身

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:00,430
在

22
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,430
瞄  准  镜

23
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,700
本片揭示了史上最危险的狙击任务
其中包括一些残酷的战争场面
部分场景已作特殊处理  请酌情观看

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,460
狙击手在战场上的任务异常艰巨
Being a sniper in combat is a very radical situation.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,390
你要清楚自己在做什么
You got to understand what you're doing.

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,170
你的目标是活人
You're hunting other human beings.

27
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,950
模拟场景

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,640
彻查周围  射杀目标
When you're looking through that scope and you take a target out,

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,480
效果立竿见影
the immediate effect it has on those around them--

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,910
对方的整个行动被迫中止
their whole agenda is now stopped.

31
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,310
现在换我行动  都是我囊中之物
Now it's my agenda. I own them.

32
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,970
梦幻之击

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,330
射杀背景:伊拉克  拉马迪  2005年
The hunting ground: Ramadi.Iraq.2005.

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,330
伊拉克  拉马迪  2005年

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,970
开始进驻拉马迪时
When we first rolled into Ramadi,

36
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,350
一周约有95到100起路边爆炸事件
the IED rate was approximately 95 to a hundred IEDs a week.

37
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,170
我们的任务就是
Our-our mission was to just

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,510
模拟场景

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,600
找到埋放路边炸弹的份子  将其剔除
find people emplacing IEDs and to take them out.

40
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,020
伊拉克

41
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,570
驻伊美军有这样一则信条
GIs fighting in Iraq have a motto:

42
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,030
拉马迪
纬度:33.427588  经度:43.298837

43
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,300
礼貌  专业  杀人需谋定而后动
Be polite, be professional and have a plan to kill everyone you meet

44
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,300
如果我们经过观察
If we are looking at you,

45
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,380
判定你是危险份子
and you have deemed yourself a bad guy,

46
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,040
那么你必死无疑
we're going to be there to kill you.

47
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,150
狙击手  詹姆斯・格里兰军士长
The sniper, first Sergeant James Gilliland.

48
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,510
保持着7.62口径狙击步枪最远射杀记录:
Longest kill shot with a 7.62 caliber rifle:

49
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,700
0.7英里[约为1250米]
Seven-tenths of a mile.

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,500
一旦此人有所行动  造成威胁
Once the individual takes that step and crosses the line,

51
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,280
就会成为我们的目标
then he comes into our world.

52
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,340
成为狙击目标
He comes as a target.

53
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,730
格里兰与影子队
Gilliland and Shadow Team,

54
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,690
十人狙击小组
a ten-man Army sniper unit,

55
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,820
埋伏在城市的各个角落  观察敌方行动
watch insurgent activity from hides throughout the city.

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,720
六个月内共射杀276人
They rank up 276 kills in six months.

57
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,540
查清预定目标行动路线的
One of the biggest techniques that we use to

58
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,420
其中一项最关键技术
find where our next targets were going to be

59
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,610
与猎鹿和火鸡很相似
is directly related to deer hunting or turkey hunting.

60
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,040
要观察整个地区  
We'd observe an area,

61
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,940
就像猎手在狩猎季节前做的
just like a lot of hunters do in pre-season,

62
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,330
把所见都印在脑子里
take mental pictures of what you're seeing,

63
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,830
记住哪里有利于狙击  哪里是盲区
what you can and can't see from what angles.

64
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,190
这些都要记忆  就像一位猎手
You start learning the players just like a hunter would learn,

65
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,050
要记住自己狩猎区的动物一样
you know, what animals are in his hunting area.

66
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,710
安德鲁・贝亚特
影子队狙击手

67
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,070
观察每一处
You watch everything

68
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,990
并印在脑子里
and you just kind of remember it in your head.

69
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,490
我们对城中每个人都了如指掌
We knew pretty much everyone in the town

70
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,810
因某些原因  其中很多人都蒙着脸
and for some reason, a lot of them would wear masks,

71
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,370
这更容易暴露
which was a big giveaway.

72
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,670
目标指示器

73
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,220
我不明白他们为什么要这么做
I don't know why they would even do that.

74
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,280
没错  伊拉克戴着滑雪面罩的家伙
Yeah, you see a guy in a ski mask in Iraq,

75
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,990
都是来者不善
that's a bad guy.

76
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,540
影子队主要的藏身之处
Shadow Team sets up its main hide

77
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,690
藏身地点

78
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,550
设在H号观察哨
on the rooftop of the O.P.Hotel,

79
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,240
俯瞰整个密西根路
overlooking Route Michigan,

80
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,010
H号观察哨

81
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,010
密西根路

82
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,380
这是拉马迪的主要街道
the major roadway through Ramadi.

83
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,370
它曾是整个城市最高的建筑
It was the tallest building in the city,

84
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,600
显然  我们可以进行全方位监视
so obviously, we had 360-degree observation.

85
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,760
我们将这个顶楼藏身地称为"乌鸦窝"
We're pretty much on the roof in the, what we called crow's nest.

86
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,380
格里兰向他的队员强调两点
Gilliland preaches two things to his team:

87
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,320
多重火力  射击躯干
multiple weapon engagements and body shots.

88
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,200
又名  质心瞄准
AKA center mass holds.

89
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,170
质心就是胸甲护着的地方
Basically, center mass is just under the breastplate.

90
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,530
不仅射击面比较宽
It would not only give you a larger target surface to hit,

91
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,270
质心瞄准

92
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,210
对狙击手心理影响也会降低
but also it could be used as, uh, desensitizing,

93
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,120
让你感觉不是在瞄准一个人
um, in a way that you're not looking at the individual.

94
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,050
不突出面部特征
Instead of picking out a facial feature to engage,

95
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,000
像是瞄准一颗扣子
you are picking out a shirt button.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,290
人们会认为  狙击时  
In the sniper game, everybody wants to think

97
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,180
一定要瞄准头部
that the head shot is the way to go.

98
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,310
质心瞄准

99
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,480
我要纠正一下
I wanted to get away from that,

100
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,810
尤其是当时那种环境
especially in that environment.

101
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,840
通常会出现几个目标
Uh, there were multiple targets regularly,

102
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:43,790
与其耗时打中两人头部
and if you wasted the time to take two well-aimed head shots,

103
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,450
不如打中五人身体躯干
you could've taken five body shots and then

104
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,770
然后争取时间再瞄准或射杀敌人
come back and either captured or reengaged and killed the enemy.

105
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,880
一天的狙击任务大概是三至四人
We were probably engaging up to three or four targets a day,

106
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,540
有时更多
sometimes more.

107
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,720
我们把他们逼得越来越远
We moved them back further and further into a point

108
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,250
他们不在距离我们800米范围之内行动
where they wouldn't do anything within 800 meters of us

109
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,230
怕被我们干掉
because they were scared of us.

110
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,440
我们听到他们无数次在喊Knas
We heard many times--Knas

111
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,550
就是指"狙击手"
was Iraqi for "Sniper."

112
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,750
通过监听清真寺和其他地方的对讲机
And we'd hear over the intercoms of the mosques and stuff.

113
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,650
狙击手  狙击手  不断提到这个词
Bla bla bla...Knas, Knas, Knas, constantly.

114
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,320
他们总在相互提醒要小心我们
I think they were always warning people

115
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,730
我们就在附近  道理很简单
that we were out there, watched out us, because,

116
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,190
他们对我们心存恐惧
honestly, fears is the big factor.

117
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,320
六个月后  
Over six months,

118
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,550
影子队铲除了附近埋放路边炸弹的人
Shadow Team clears their sector of IEDs,

119
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,370
但真正的危险却在楼顶
but the real danger will come from the rooftops.

120
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,270
2005年9月27日

121
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,620
我们当时要掩护一支队伍
We were overwatching one of the line companies.

122
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,610
这队人负责管制
They were doing a cordoned search in the

123
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,130
位于H号观察哨北部的工业区
industrial areas to the north side of the O.P. Hotel

124
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,970
为了获得最佳监视角度
A common practice for a lot of units

125
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,770
最常用的方法就是
to get the best observation they can get,

126
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,290
在建筑物的楼顶进行巡视
they would go to the rooftops of buildings.

127
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,220
一旦采用这种方法  就将暴露无疑
And when you do that, you skyline yourself.

128
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,490
就像长在山上的一棵孤树
just like you can see a single tree on the mountain,

129
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,260
直挺挺  异常显眼
if it sticks up above the mountain.

130
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,430
这些人当时就是如此
And that's essentially what these guys were doing.

131
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,400
完全把自己变成枪靶子
They were making targets of themselves.

132
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,920
我拨过去提醒他们
I called and I was like,

133
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,170
告诉杰森  让他蹲下
"Hey, you need to tell Jason he needs to get down"

134
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,150
提醒之后  也就一会儿工夫
And you know, lo and behold, a few minutes would go by and

135
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,390
他和其他几个人又站起来
he'd be standing up again with a couple of the other guys.

136
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,200
我又打过去  对他们说
I called back down there and was like,

137
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,750
告诉杰森  让他蹲下
"Hey, you know, you need to tell Jason he needs to get back down.

138
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,550
所有人都能看到他  我能看得清清楚楚
Everybody can see him. If I can see him where I'm at,

139
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,650
其他人也可以
everybody else can see him."

140
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,710
第三次看到他还站在楼顶时
When I saw this going on for the third time,

141
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,220
我又抓起对讲机
I picked the radio up.

142
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,500
正当我准备再次警告他
Right as I was going to go to key it to tell him,

143
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,050
再次提醒  让你的人都蹲下
Hey, you need to get those guys down, one more time.

144
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,880
送话钮还没来得及按下
Right before I pushed the the talk button is

145
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,370
只见他抽动了一下  倒在了地上
when I saw him jerk and he fell.

146
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,290
有人中枪  有人中枪
Man down! Man down!

147
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,050
有人从医院方向伏击我们
We're being shot at from the hospital!

148
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,940
我们负责掩护任务
We were providing overwatch

149
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,420
听到对讲机那头喊着
and then you hear over the radio,

150
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,650
有人中枪  敌方狙击手打中一人
"Man down. Someone just got shot by an enemy sniper."

151
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,220
于是  我们观察周围情况
So we are just glued to the scopes,

152
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,980
仔细检查每一处  想找出狙击手
looking everywhere, trying to find this sniper.

153
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,450
从医院方向查起
So, we start looking at the hospital and

154
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,200
格里兰军士长
Sergeant Gilliland saw

155
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,110
在顶层的一扇窗户外发现那人
the sniper in the window on one of the top floors.

156
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,850
我注意到那是四层
I noticed on the fourth floor,

157
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,070
有一人站在阳台上
there was a single individual standing in a bay window,

158
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,250
能清楚看到有人拿着
I could clearly make out

159
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,850
长枪管卡的拉什尼科夫式步枪
a loner barrel with Kalashnikov targer rifle

160
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,350
目标

161
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,340
从我们这里到医院距离是1250米
We knew that from our building to that hospital was 1250 meters

162
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,090
换算成英里是0.7英里
or seven-tenth a mile from our observation post.

163
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:38,030
那次任务我们使用的是M24式狙击步枪
The rifle we had for that was a standard shot: 24 sniper rifle.

164
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:38,030
武器型号: M24式狙击步枪
口径: 7.62X51mm
枪口初速: 每秒2600英尺
最大有效射程: 875码[约800米]

165
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:43,230
当时距离那个狙击手为1367码
via that sniper was 1367 yards away.

166
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,390
相当于13.5个橄榄球场
This distance is 13 and a half football fields.

167
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,720
超出他的M24式最大有效射程500码
nearly 500 yards beyond the max effective range of Glilliland's M24.

168
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,870
这种情况下  最佳结果不是打中目标
The perfect contain was not to make a one-round clean shot.

169
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,680
而是阻吓目标
It was to, at that distance, surprise target.

170
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,490
M24配有刘波尔德M3A型密位镜
M24 has a Leupold, M3A scope of fixed-power with a mil-dot

171
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,350
俯仰角调整手轮
and bullet drop compensator.

172
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,280
每个刻度代表一百码
You correlate the number to the amount of 100 yard to on the shoot

173
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,170
我把旋钮转到十  来打一千码
I turned that turn to ten to shoot for 1000 yards

174
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,990
快速预估了弹头下降幅度
A quick calculation, I estimated the bullet drop, decided that

175
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,350
我需要向上提高三个密位
I needed to hold about three miles over the target

176
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,540
来补偿弹道下降
to compensate for the drop.

177
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,700
在1367码距上  一个密位是4英尺
At 1,367 yards, each mil-dot represents four feet.

178
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,100
弹头下降幅度

179
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,100
12尺

180
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,010
因重力和空气阻力  漫长的飞行距离中
The great distance and severe drop of the bullet,

181
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,750
弹头会大幅下降
due to gravity and drag,

182
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,510
故要将准心移到目标上方12尺处
means Gilliland must aim 12 feet above the target.

183
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,850
此外还要考虑风速
And also, in doing that, had to allow for the wind,

184
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,770
风力对弹头的作用及弹头自转产生的偏差
which will push the round, as well as spin drift.

185
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,900
当弹头旋转着穿行于大气中时
As the round is flying through the air and spinning,

186
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,730
旋转偏离

187
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,560
其自身旋转所产生的力
the force that is caused by the actual spin

188
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,330
会导致其偏转
will cause it to rotate up and

189
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,600
从而偏离原来的运动轨道  道理等同于陀螺
away from the center line of the bore, much like a top.

190
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,970
陀螺在旋转过程中
It would eventually start

191
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,500
会向旋转的方向偏移
moving in the direction of the the spin.

192
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,930
子弹在运动时也会产生同样的偏移
It's the same way for the actual bullet.

193
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,040
不过偏移度有规律可循
It's measured and it's pretty constant,

194
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,830
可通过公式计算出来  
so you can use a formula to account for that.

195
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,520
格里兰将准心向左留出8英尺提前量
Gilliland aims or "Holds off" eight feet left

196
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,080
以抵消风速和旋转带来的偏移
of the target to compensate for a light wind and spin drift.

197
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,070
这种方法也称"肯塔基风偏"
This compensation is known as Kentucy Windage.

198
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,690
肯塔基风偏

199
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,970
准心不压在目标上
Uh, the crosshairs were completely off-target.

200
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,680
只要感觉对了
Once I was comfortable with where my sight was,

201
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,950
扣动扳机即可
I just squeezed the round off.

202
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,040
我注意到  目标人物抽搐了一下
I noticed the target grimace and then,

203
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,770
随即倒在地上  没再站起来
He fell back and didn't see him come back up again.

204
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,150
看到对方倒地后  我转头对着观察手说
After the guy went down, I turned around and looked at my spotter,

205
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,340
"看到了吗"  接到报告说
I said, "Did you see that?" The report came back.

206
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,270
有一名男子倒在四楼的阳台上
There was a single individual, male, on the fourth floor balcony

207
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,110
胸部正中  中一枪
with a single, um, gunshot wound to the center of the chest.

208
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,200
角度非常精准
And the angle was pretty, pretty severe.

209
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,150
子弹位于其身体内  并且完整
So...the bullet actually was in it, in one part,

210
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,250
且留在了对方的身体里
and stopped somewhere inside the individual's body.

211
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,750
这种狙击任务中包含各种因素
There's, there's so many factors to a shot like that.

212
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,950
像这么远射程  这一枪简直是无可挑剔
And over a distance like that, it had to fall just perfect.

213
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,420
万里挑一
It was a one-in-a-million shot.

214
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,260
格里兰使用M24狙击步枪
Gilliland's kill shot at seven-tenths of a mile

215
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,080
完成0.7英里的狙击任务
with his M24 sniper rifle,

216
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,860
刷新了7.62mm口径的狙击记录
rewrites the record books for 7.62-caliber rifles.

217
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,320
其实  我当时并没指望打中这个人
In all honesty, I wasn't trying to necessarily engage the individual

218
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,430
只想尽力打在他的身边
as much as I was trying to get around

219
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,480
迫使他离开阳台
close enough to him to get him out of the window.

220
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,520
当时一心想阻止他狙击我们的人
I wanted to stop him from engaging, you know, our guys.

221
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,160
不过  这算是他自食恶果吧
Um, but he got what he got.

222
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,670
越南  1969年  一名海陆狙击手
Vietnam, 1969. A Marine sniper

223
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,040
在100码的范围内面对着几百个敌军
faces hundreds of enemy soldiers less than 100 yards away.

224
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,720
我十字线压着对方脑门
I've got the reticle right on his forehead,

225
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,270
然后迅速地一个接一个  全部干掉
and then as fast as I can move from one to the next,

226
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,130
只听到  "砰  砰  砰"
it was just, pow, pow, pow!

227
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,690
16次开火  16个位置
At 16 different battles at 16 different positions,

228
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,140
不容任何差池
and you can't miss.

229
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,880
否则自己必死无疑
Or you're dead.

230
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,180
弗吉尼亚州匡提科  精密武器区

伊森・普雷斯
前海军陆战队狙击手

234
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,930
这是M40X式狙击步枪  可谓是所有
This is the M40X sniper rifle and this is basically the father to--

235
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,830
目前装备使用的M40A3狙击步枪之父
the M40A3 is the modern sniper rifles that we use today.

236
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,510
使用这种武器系统射击难度更大
Much more difficult to shoot with this weapon system and

237
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,290
也是恰克・马嵬尼等狙击手成为传奇的原因之一
that's one of the reasons those guys like Chuck Mawhinney such legends

238
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,420
他们只配发简陋的狩猎步枪
they were given just the basic hunting rifle and unbelievable,

239
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,720
给敌人带来难以置信的毁灭性打击
the devastation that they were able to inflict.

240
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,700
已瞄准目标
On target.

241
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,840
择机开火
Fire when ready.

242
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,380
送你上西天  伙计
Say good night, fella.

243

模拟场景

245
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,360
从我摸到雷明顿700步枪的那一刻
From the time I touched that Remington 700,

246
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,700
就深深爱上了它并决定成为狙击手
I was in love with it and I wanted to be a sniper.

247
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,100
我要去猎杀那些妄图杀死我的敌人
I'm gonna hunt something that's gonna hunt me back.

248
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,240
我喜欢那种感觉
Oh, I love that.

249
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,830
狙击手  恰克・马嵬尼

256
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,340
该绰号因此地激烈的西部风格枪战而得来
Nicknamed for its Wild West-style firefights.

257
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,930
环境极其复杂
Environment is target-rich.

258
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,330
那地方真的很热
That was a really hot area.

259
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,440
各种复杂因素包罗其中
I mean, there was a lot of things going on.

260
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,350
极易于隐藏  也利于渗透
It was easy to hide, it was easy to move through,

261
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,490
对狙击手来说  这里得天独厚
as far as a sniper, you couldn't have found a better area.

262
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,890
马嵬尼的主战武器  M40狙击步枪

在那里以这个距离射击敌人时
You hit somebody out there at that distance,

266
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,210
他们无法确定来袭火力的方向
they're not sure where anything's coming from.

267
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,940
他一头栽倒之后
He got towards the end,

268
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,860
在那个距离上我们就看不到几个
we didn't see a lot of people stand around up in the open any more

269
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,860
站着暴露的敌人了
at these long distances

270
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,790
1969年  情人节
Valentine's Day, 1969.

271
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,530
马嵬尼与数百名
Mawhinney is on a collision course

272
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,490
狭路相逢
with hundreds of North Vietnamese soldiers.

273
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,730
天就要下雨了
And there was a monsoon coming in.

274
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,560
我们接到空中侦察报告说
We had a large NVA force reported by aircraft

275
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,330
大批北越军队正向我们的位置运动
moving towards our position and they said,

276
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,060
北越军队

277
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,060
马嵬尼

278
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,100
他们说由于下雨不能向我提供空中支援
"I can't get air support for you because of the monsoon.

279
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,120
我和我们的指挥官进行了沟通  我说
I talked with our CO about what was going on and I said,

280
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,190
我愿带上配星光瞄具的M14步枪和我的搭档
"I would like to take the M14, the Starlight, my partner and go down

281
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,820
晚上去那条河边进行警戒
and watch that river this evening

282
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,790
看他们是否企图渡河
and see if they try to cross it."

283
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,290
我们收拾行装启程前去
We loaded up our gear and headed down.

284
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,330
多数狙击手的攻击对象是300到1000码内的
Most sniper engagements are single targets

285
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,750
单个目标
at 300 to 1,000 yards.

286
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,910
而马嵬尼将面对的可能是
Mawhinney faces the possibility

287
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,140
距他不足100码的多个目标
of multiple targets within 100 yards of his position.

288
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,560
远射程能保证我们的安全  
Our range is our safety,

289
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,560
克瑞斯特・杰克  美国海军陆战队
《一枪毙命》作者之一

290
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,490
能保持我们与目标的安全距离
our stand off.

291
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,010
如果我在1000码距离向你开枪
If I can shoot you at 1,000 yards,

292
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,810
在这个距离你甚至都看不到我
you can't even see me at 1,000 yards.

293
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,080
但你若离我二三十码的话  
But if you are at 20 30 yards away from me,

294
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,020
你能看到能听到甚至嗅到我
you can see me, you can hear and you can smell me,

295
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,500
敌人很容易觉察到你
the enemy can taste you

296
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,020
马嵬尼未选用最擅长的手动上膛M40栓动步枪
Mawhinney swaps his trusty bolt action M40

297
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,630
而选用了他的副武器  M14半自动步枪
for his secondary weapon: a semiautomatic M14.

298
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,880
我很清楚我得尽量速战速决
I knew that I had to do it as fast as I could.

299
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,630
拖得越久就会给他们更多的时间
The longer time I took was more time for them

300
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,670
来作出反应  探明我们的位置
to start figuring out where we were, what was going on.

301
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,610
M14步枪使用弹匣供弹
The M14, you put a magazine in,

302
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:41,870
武器型号：M14半自动步枪
口径：7.62X51mm
枪口初速:每秒2800英尺
射速:750发每分

303
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,050
它是一种半自动武器
it's a semiautomatic weapon.

304
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,680
可以自动装填弹药
So, it automatically feeds.

305
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,700
将新一发子弹装入枪膛
That's less time for getting

306
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,730
预备击发所用的时间更短
a new round in the chamber ready to fire.

307
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,260
夜幕降临
Night falls.

308
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,500
马嵬尼和他的观察手隐蔽在
Mawhinney and his spotter conceal themselves

309
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,500
他们的最终射击位置  亦称FFP
at their final firing position or "FFP."

310
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,750
他们埋伏在能俯瞰河道最浅处的地方
Their hide overlooks the shallowest part of the river--

311
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,980
这里最有可能成为渡口
the most likely crossing point.

312
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,410
你在设置埋伏的时候
When you're setting up a hide,

313
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,670
就是在选择一个最方便你工作的地方
you're obviously picking a place where you're gonna work from.

314
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,150
我下埋伏时  我要求对目标区域有良好视野
What I wanna do is, I want a good view of where I want to shoot at,

315
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,310
并且具备理想的撤退路线
and I want a good escape and evasion route.

316
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,430
最终射击位置

317
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,090
河道自3点钟到9点钟方位经过
The river runs from 9:00 to 3:00,

318
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,650
在马嵬尼和敌人间形成了一道天然屏障
providing a natural barrier between Mawhinney and the enemy.

319
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,340
一片小泥滩位于12点钟方位
A small mudbank at 12:00

320
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,200
对轻武器射击起到保护
offers protection from small arms fire,

321
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,840
但提供了开阔的视野
but allows a clear field of view.

322
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,910
3点到9点方向分布的树林和灌木能提供隐蔽
Brush and foliage from 3:00 to 9:00 provide concealment.

323
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,560
马嵬尼的观察手负责保证该区域的安全
Mawhinney's spotter is responsible for security in this sector.

324
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,650
如果任务失败
If the mission is compromised,

325
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,220
他们的撤退路线位于5点钟方位
the Marines' escape route is at 5:00.

326
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,380
马嵬尼的瞄具  AN/PVS-2星光瞄准镜
Mawhinney's eye: An AN/PVS-2 Starlight Scope.

327
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,480
一种由周围光线触发的被动夜视系统
A passive night vision system activated by ambient light.

328
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,290
在星光瞄准镜里满眼都是绿色
Everything's in a real green tint through the Starlight

329
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,790
浅色的物体会更亮
and light things will show up brighter than others.

330
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,840
比如脸  皮肤和手
Like a face and skin and hands,

331
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,680
这些在瞄准镜下更为显眼
it really lights up through the scope.

332
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,000
星光瞄准镜需要
You gotta have some kind of

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,740
外界提供光源才能工作
external light for the Starlight to work.

334
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,570
如果是一片漆黑  那你什么也看不见
If it's just pitch, pitch black, you can't see anything.

335
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,170
马嵬尼来回观察着河对岸的动静
Mawhinney scans the river for any sign of the enemy.

336
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,890
那晚我们埋伏了好长时间
So we sit through that night for a long time

337
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:09,480
大约半小时后发现河对岸有动静
and about a half hour later we got movement on the other side.

338
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,640
有人下河准备渡河
Somebody gets in the river and they start coming across,

339
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,590
并正朝着我们走来
walking right straight at us.

340
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,750
步枪上膛  只待击发
Rifle's loaded, it's ready to go.

341
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,580
他离我足够近
He's close enough to me

342
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,790
我甚至能听到水从他身上滴下的声音
and I hear water dripping off of him.

343
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,260
我绝不能让他溜走通过草地
There's no way I can let him get between me and the company

344
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,220
并威胁到连队  那样我们就麻烦大了
and that elephant grass 'cause we're gonna have a mess.

345
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,230
我打开保险  扣向扳机
I've got the safety off and I'm putting pressure on the trigger.

346
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,610
我将准星对准他脸正中间
I've got the reticle right in the middle of his face

347
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,550
已经准备好送他上归西了
and I'm just getting ready to dispatch him.

348
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,120
可很快他又退回到河里
And then pretty soon he retreats back in the river

349
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,450
向河对岸退去
and goes back on to the other side.

350
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,000
我告诉我的搭档他极有可能因此被捕
I told my partner this might really get him arrested

351
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,720
马嵬尼等待着北越军的出现
Mawhinney waits for the NVA to appear.

352
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,490
脑海里构想着他的交火地域
He mentally visualizes his field of fire.

353
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,700
射杀区域的大概有一个橄榄球场的长度
The Kill Zone is roughly the length of one football field.

354
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,180
射杀区域

355
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,960
你要尽量不能让战火烧到你脚下
You try to basically play the game before it comes to you.

356
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,460
你要预测可能发生的情况并运用策略
You're anticipating what can happen and you're doing your strategy

357
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,440
比如  他们前进到这里该我怎么办
you know-- "What am I gonna do if they go here?

358
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,620
在这里我怎么对付他们
How can I funnel them here?

359
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,710
我怎么才能把他们引入最佳射击位置
What do I need to do to put them in the best position,

360
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,290
在什么位置我可以消灭目标
where I can eliminate the targets

361
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,460
我预先设想好了一切可能发生的情况
I got every picture in my mind, what was gonna take place.

362
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,290
所以当目标真正出现时  你对此已早有准备
So, when the actual targets actually show up, it's not something new.

363
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,710
此时你就不用考虑那一切了
Now you don't have to think about all that.

364
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,720
那已成为肌肉记忆  早已刻在了你的意识里
It's muscle memory, you've already built it in there.

365
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,130
马嵬尼估算了离他最近和最远目标间的距离
Mawhinney assigns distances to his closest and farthest shots.

366
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,230
你身处的位置决定了你没时间去计算
You're in a position where you don't have time to do an equation

367
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,680
或调整到合适距离  所以只有猜测距离
or get a proper range, then it's range guesstimation.

368
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,210
恰克并没有坐在那里进行计算
Chuck was not sitting there and doing calculations.

369
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,380
而是在"估算"
This was basically "Swagging It".

370
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,960
我们称"瞎猜"的学名叫"估算"
We call a scientific wild ass guess as swag

371
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,090
马嵬尼输入参数也就是调整射距至50码
Mawhinney dials in or "Dopes his scope" for 50 yards:

372
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,760
也就是开始狙杀的距离
point to impact

373
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,850
大概45分钟到1小时后  他们来了
Maybe 45 minutes to an hour later, here they come.

374
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,240
他只身潜伏在一片陌生之地
He's out in the middle of nowhere by himself.

375
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,450
友军在他身后的方向
He's got his friendly forces to his rear

376
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,850
马嵬尼

377
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,850
美军

378
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,660
正前方是敌人  他正处于中间位置
and the enemy to his front, so he's in the middle.

379
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,340
越共军队

380
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,340
马嵬尼

381
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,340
美军

382
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,550
如果越军急速冲过河来
If they rush and get across the river,

383
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,590
他逃脱撤退的机会近乎渺茫
he has very little chance of escaping and evading.

384
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,490
想象一下他们会怎么处置俘虏的狙击手
Imagine what they would do to a sniper if they caught him.

385
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,110
他会被折磨
That would be torture for...

386
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,020
一直到死
forever.

387
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,990
如果情况真的到了这一步  
If the situation came to the point that

388
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,990
我深知我们没机会逃脱
I knew we didn't have a chance,

389
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,310
他们朝我们冲过来  我们无路可退
they were coming in on us, there was no way

390
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,110
我会被活捉
I was gonna be taken alive.

391
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,310
北越

392
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,310
南越

393
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,150
亚利桑那属地
北纬15.84度  东经108.06度

394
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,860
南越  1969年情人节
South Vietnam, Valentine's Day, 1969.

395
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,950
海陆狙击手恰克・马嵬尼和他的观察手
Marine sniper Chuck Mawhinney and his spotter

396
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,210
在富邦松河边设下埋伏
set up an ambush along the Phu Bon Song River.

397
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,910
在不足100码之外
Less than 100 yards away,

398
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,300
一个营的北越士兵正朝他们走来
an NVA battalion heads straight for them.

399
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,590
我不是个迷信的人
I was never a real, real religious man,

400
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,840
但当你趴在那而且只有我们两个人时
but when you're laying there and and there's just two of you,

401
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,010
你会变得前所未有地迷信
you can get more religious than you ever thought you could be.

402
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,810
恰克・马嵬尼
前美陆战队狙击手

403
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,780
于是我等到领头的家伙下到
So I wait until the first guy gets up about,

404
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,160
河水齐膝的地方时
just about knee-deep in the water.

405
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,850
我把准星对准他的前额
I've got the reticle right on his forehead.

406
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,570
当他一起身  我扣动了扳机
Just as he gets up, I pull the trigger.

407
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,150
他中弹倒下
And he hits, goes down.

408
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,010
接着我以最快的速度瞄准到下一个目标
And then as fast as I can move from one to the next,

409
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,020
随后就是  
it was just pow, pow, pow!

410
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,240
他们不知所措也不知道发生了什么
They don't know what to do and they don't know what's happening.

411
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,900
站在河里发呆
They just froze in the river.

412
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,480
而我就一个接一个地射杀
And I'm just going from one to the next to the next to the next.

413
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,950
你能看到被打飞的帽子
And you can see the hats fly up,

414
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,870
还有在河里倒下的尸体
bodies start going down the river.

415
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,710
我开了16枪
Well, I shot 16 times.

416
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,610
16具尸体倒在河中
16 went down the river.

417
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,960
马嵬尼阻击了敌人  
Mawhinney stops the enemy,

418
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,160
却违背了一个狙击手的基本准则
but he violates the sniper's cardinal rule:

419
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,320
在同一位置决不能开火超过两次
never fire more than two shots from a single position.

420
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,270
猎人现在成了被猎杀的对象
The hunter is now the hunted.

421
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,050
我那天晚上开枪过多
That's a lot of shooting at night,

422
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,900
暴露了自己的位置
which tells everybody where you're at.

423
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,530
你能听到子弹朝我们这里飞来
You could hear rounds coming our direction.

424
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,220
我告诉我的搭档  该撤了
I tell my partner, "It's time to get out of here."

425
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,020
我们就边打边撤
So we beat feet back.

426
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,940
30秒内射击16次
16 shots, 30 seconds.

427
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,690
马嵬尼消失在了丛林之中
Mawhinney vanishes into the jungle.

428
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,640
仅一次射击就需要许多复杂步骤
So many things go into making just one shot.

429
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,690
就像交响乐一样  射击有它自己的节奏
It's like its own little symphony.

430
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:08,620
那一晚  恰克的表现堪称完美
That night, right there and then, Chuck was flawless.

431
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,200
克瑞斯特・杰克  美国海军陆战队
《一枪毙命》作者之一

432
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,760
他演绎了一曲狙击交响乐
He was a symphony.

433
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,750
马嵬尼是怎样成功阻击
How did Mawhinney stop an enemy force

434
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:18,280
星光瞄准镜

435
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,760
数百倍于己的敌人的
that outnumbered him by hundreds?

436
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,690
一切都要从星光瞄准镜说起
It all starts with the Starlight scope,

437
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,230
一种夜视技术的早期简易版本
a crude early version of night vision technology.

438
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,540
星光瞄准镜下的视野就像模糊的
The Starlight scope is like watching the old fuzzy TV

439
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,710
带天线的老电视的图像
with the bunny ears.

440
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,630
你得摇晃它个六七次才能
You have to, like, shake it six times just to

441
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,520
调出频道  而几秒钟后又没信号了
get the channel to go in and 5 seconds later it's out of focus again.

442
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,160
现在我们的新型AN PVS-10
Where the AN PVS-10, our,

443
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,450
星光瞄准镜                      AN PVS-10瞄准镜

444
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,210
夜视瞄准镜的视野就像高清电视
new night scopes, is like turning on HDTV.

445
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,020
所以能识别目标已经实属不易
So your targets aren't that easily defined.

446
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,300
更难以置信的是
Which is another thing that makes it

447
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,820
他还干掉了这么多敌人
incredible the amount of people he was able to put down.

448
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,230
阴天光线很弱
With the overcast and what little bit of light we did have

449
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,630
透过暴雨  在50到60米的距离上
through that storm, at 50-60 meters,

450
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,700
就已经很难看清
it was really getting really hard to see.

451
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,300
16枪全部命中头部是因为
There were 16 head shots 'cause

452
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,770
那是我唯一能瞄准的部位
that's all I really had to shoot at.

453
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,390
目标

454
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,910
正常人自腰部以上的高度平均为36英寸
The average human being is 36 inches from the waist up.

455
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,530
但马嵬尼只能通过瞄具看到敌人的头部
But Mawhinney can only see the enemy's head through his scope,

456
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,170
目标的尺寸减少到不足10英寸
reducing the target to a mere ten inches.

457
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,850
对于狙击手来说他的射击距离相对较近
He's shooting at a relatively close range for a sniper,

458
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,460
但要考虑到那是在夜晚的条件下
but when you throw in the fact that it's at night

459
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,500
目标也不是静止的而是在运动
and these aren't stationary targets, they're moving.

460
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,810
他需要在目标晃动的情况下
He's got to find that ten inches

461
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,910
瞄准那10英尺的部位
as it moves from left to right, up and down.

462
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,650
之后他得重新再做一遍  循环往复16次
And then he has to do the same thing over again, 16 different times.

463
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,320
这是发生在16个不同位置的16次战斗
So it's 16 different battles and 16 different positions,

464
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,500
绝不能失手  否则死的就是你
and, you can't miss or you're dead.

465
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,970
马嵬尼的M14步枪处于半自动模式
Mawhinney's M14 is in semiautomatic mode.

466
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,970
武器型号：M14半自动步枪

467
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,850
他每1.9秒就击中一个目标
He hits a target every 1.9 seconds.

468
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,660
事先做好计划可以避免低劣的战斗表现
Prior planning prevents piss-poor performance.

469
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,220
如果他那晚用的是雷明顿[指M40]
If he decided to take out the Remington that night,

470
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,950
这会我们也就见不到他了
you would have never been talking about Chuck right now

471
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,530
因为要是这样的话他早已经挂了
'cause he probably would have been killed.

472
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,660
目标的预估对我们来讲很重要
The proximity of the target's very important to us.

473
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,440
那晚  当他在不到100码面对那么多敌人
That night, when he had that many people within a hundred yards,

474
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,550
他首先选对了武器
the choice that he had in his hand was the right choice.

475
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,970
半自动  他能做到两秒一发
Semi-automatic, he could fire a shot every two seconds,

476
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,030
军士长 威廉姆斯・斯凯莱斯
陆战队 武器训练营

477
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,550
不需要再装填就能在短时间内
not reload the weapon and get the most firepower down

478
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,360
发射大量精确火力
accurately as he could in that short amount of time.

479
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,520
栓动式的M40用的是五发的弹仓
The bolt-action M40 has a five-round magazine.

480
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,520
武器型号:M40

481
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,710
而M14是半自动  且用的是20发弹匣
The M14 is semi-automatic and holds 20 rounds.

482
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,710
武器型号:M14

483
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,660
飞出去的子弹越多 对面死掉的也就越多
More rounds downrange faster mean more dead enemy soldiers.

484
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,560
非常规部队中很多人有个概念
A lot of people who are operators explain

485
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,580
叫"行动暴力"
something called "Violence of action."

486
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,760
就是重火力  你我敌对
Massive firepower, you versus me,

487
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,990
我在较近距离用比你强悍的火力压倒你
I'm gonna put you down with massive firepower at a closer range.

488
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,610
恰克那晚上在那种距离上
What Chuck faced that night,

489
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,080
面对的情况是  他必须尽快解决他们
at that range, he had to put 'em down fast.

490
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,880
所以你得从最前的开始  由近及远
That's you start it near to far.

491
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,190
行动暴力

492
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,800
不能先打100码距离上那个
You don't hit somebody at a hundred yards and

493
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,490
再等别人走近  不然他早就到你面前了
work up to the guy close to you, because by then he'd be on you.

494
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,010
所以要像推多米诺骨牌  从最前面开始
So you put 'em down near to far like dominoes falling.

495
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,810
正因如此  那天他们最终都下水喂了王八
Of course they all became good swimmers down the river that night.

496
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,970
行动暴力  这招很实用
Violence of action is a good practice to have.

497
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,700
马嵬尼的每发子弹都以2800尺/秒的速度离膛
Each round Mawhinney fires leaves the muzzle at 2800 feet/s,

498
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,170
外弹道

499
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,020
超过两倍音速
more than twice the speed of sound.

500
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,580
子弹以大约每分钟20万转的速度自转
The bullet rotates at approximately 200,000 revolutions per minute,

501
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,870
击中目标所耗时间少于半秒钟
propelling it into the target in less than half a second.

502
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,110
敌人在听见枪声之前就已经死了
The enemy is dead before he hears the gunshot.

503
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,510
当时就是这么个情况
I was in such a zone.

504
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,390
我把自己想象成子弹来观瞄
I would look through the rifle, but I'm the bullet.

505
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,790
我怎么持枪才能保证我打中目标
Where do I got to hold this rifle to get me where I want to go?

506
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,460
那是当时我脑子里唯一的念头
That was the only thing that was in my mind at that time.

507
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,110
电光火石间尘埃落定  自然而然就这样了
all it is that happens is all at once and, and it just become natural

508
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,790
海陆狙击手学校位于弗吉尼亚匡提科
Marine Scout Sniper School, Quantico, Virginia.

509
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,750
是世界顶尖的几位狙击手的母校
Home to some of the top snipers in the world.

510
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,870
今天  他们当中的一位将会尝试
Today, one of them will try to

511
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,340
重演恰克・马嵬尼的30秒16连发
duplicate Chuck Mawhinney's 16 hits in 30 seconds.

512
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,720
这里是305靶场
This is a range called Range 305.

513
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,610
在这里放置这些气球
Put the balloons up, obviously,

514
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,600
是用爆气球来模拟爆人头
because a shot, balloon busts, the guy is dead.

515
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,780
这些就是马嵬尼当时必须干掉的目标
It simulates this soldier's head that Chuck had to hit.

516
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,360
人的头部大约是10英寸长
A human head is ten inches long,

517
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,780
双手过头顶举着AK47或是别的什么 
arms above their heads with their AK-47s,whatever they're carrying

518
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,750
正在涉水
So... and they're wading through the water.

519
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,800
大概是以单兵间距10尺的交错队形前进
they would probably approach in a staggered column about 10 feet apart.

520
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,570
他们得保持较近距离
So they had to be close enough

521
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,170
以便能看到彼此  并通过手势沟通
they still can see each other and give hand-arm signals,

522
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,890
又要有足够间隔   不至被一台机枪全扫了
but far enough that a machine gun won't take the whole gang out.

523
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,680
根据马嵬尼回忆  在大约30秒里
According to Chuck Mawhinney, in around 30 seconds,

524
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,170
他开了16枪
he shot 16 times.

525
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,790
30秒后  16个倒霉蛋就改行
After 30 seconds, there was 16 new human buoys

526
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,350
在河里当浮标了
going down the river.

527
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,230
用这件现代神兵 
With this modern-era weapon,

528
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,540
半自动的7.62  还带个很棒的瞄准镜 
semiautomatic 7.62 with this awesome scope,

529
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,540
瞄准镜为Schmit&Bender 德国货  号称瞄准镜中的兰博基尼

530
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,490
让我们拭目以待
we're going to see if he can simulate that.

531
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,820
我说"上"  你就开火打第一个
I give the command "Up," Engage the firs t target,

532
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,760
然后你有30秒用16发解决16个目标
and you'll have 30 seconds to engage 16 shots, 16 targets.

533
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,520
射手准备
Shooter, ready.

534
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,370
预备
Stand by.

535
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,660
上
Up!

536
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,600
停火
Cease fire.

537
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,240
15发15中  25秒
15 shots, 15 kills-- 25 seconds.

538
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,560
唯一一个活口  躲在平台后面的紫色气球
The only surviving target: A purple balloon hidden by a berm.

539
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,390
这个紫气球实际上是友军
The lavender balloon was actually a friendly.

540
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,850
他知道  所以就放过它了
He knew that and left him alone.

541
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,880
怀特已经接近马嵬尼了
White nearly matches Mawhinney's sharpshooting,

542
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,950
不过环境还是差了很多
but under far different circumstances.

543
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,380
中士  詹姆斯・怀特
陆战队狙击手

544
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,900
恰克那一战真是惊天地泣鬼神
That's just an amazing feat that Chuck did

545
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,650
因为我这里的目标都是死靶子
'cause these targets were not moving.

546
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,260
我都知道它们在哪
I knew where they were.

547
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,470
它们也没有拿枪对着我
They didn't have guns pointed at me,

548
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,270
我也不是夜间射击
I wasn't laying the re in the middle of the night,

549
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,850
我用的是狙击用的白光镜
and I had the Scout Sniper day scope on there

550
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,570
而不是模糊的老式微光夜视镜
instead of a fuzzy Starlight scope at night, so,

551
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,090
所以他真是很了不起
that's just utterly amazing that he was able to do that.

552
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,830
那天晚上恰克说了  一夫当关
That night, Chuck said, "You know what? I own this river.

553
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,620
万夫莫开
you are not crossing it."

554
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,410
1969年2月14日
February 14, 1969.

555
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,030
那可是情人节
Think about it. St. Valentine's Day.

556
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:10,600
这是我给北越军的情人节杀杀大礼包 
Yeah, my little St. Valentine Day Massacre present to the NVA.

557
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,430
恰克・马嵬尼在越南呆了16个月
Chuck Mawhinney is in Vietnam for 16 months.

558
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,880
确认毙敌103人  可能击杀216人
He racks up 103 kills with 216 probables,

559
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,900
是陆战队史上确认击杀最多的人
giving him the most confirmed kills in Marine Corps history.

560
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,260
人们问我有没有关于越战的噩梦
People have asked me if I had nightmares about Vietnam.

561
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,510
我承认有  但却不是因为某次击杀
Yeah, I have, but never because of a hit.

562
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,750
有次我看见个越共穿过一片稻田
I see a VC walking across the paddy

563
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,930
离我约300米  我给了一个19英寸的提前量 
he's about 300 meters from me and I got, like, a 19-inch hold.

564
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,460
我瞄准了预定的地方  扣了扳机
I put it exactly where it should be, squeezed the rifle off.

565
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,120
他转过头来  看着我
And he turned around and he looked at me.

566
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,830
我永生难忘
And that look I'll never forget.

567
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,540
他就那么看了我一眼
He just glared at me.

568
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,830
他的表情我永生难忘
The look in the face never went away.

569
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,170
我看不见我打死的那些人  但我看见了他
I can't... I can't see anybody I shot, but I can see him.

570
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,250
从此我就不得不在余生反复自问
Now I have to think the rest of my life,

571
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,260
他会杀谁  这问题一直困扰着我
"Who'd he kill?" That's the one that haunts me.

572
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,960
35年后  另一名狙击手在一场陆战队史上
35 years later, another sniper fights for his life

573
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,770
最血腥的战斗之一当中浴血
in one of the bloodiest battles in Marine Corps history

574
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,500
狙击手是部队的能量增幅器
Snipers are a force multiplier.

575
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,360
狙击手带观察手就能控制一片区域
You can control an area with just you and your spotter.

576
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,810
我们的击杀率高得吓人
Our shot-to-hit ratio is amazing.

577
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,110
一般的  一个目标平均1.3发
Basically, it's 1.3 rounds per kill.

578
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,450
狙击手的厉害之处是在敌群中播种恐惧的能力
The sniper's main weapon is his ability to induce fear in the enemy,

579
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,650
不仅仅就是打倒一个人
across a much wider group of men

580
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,850
而是能阻吓更多的人
than maybe the one person he's just taken down.

581
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,390
这才真是件厉害的武器 
That's a hell of a weapons system.

582
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,860
伊拉克

583
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,840
费卢杰  2004年
Fallujah, 2004.

584
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,340
费卢杰
东经33.3003  北纬43.7717

585
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,970
伊战爆发一年之后  最血腥的战役即将展开
The bloodiest battle of the year-old Iraq War is about to erupt.

586
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,880
四名美国安全承包商遭遇伏击并被虐尸 
Four U.S. Security contractors are ambushed and mutilated.

587
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,330
报复来得很快
Revenge is swift.

588
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,900
陆战队开始了"决心警戒行动"
The Marines launch Operation Vigilant Resolve.

589
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,430
我们上尉站在车上  他说
Our captain stood up on a vehicle, and he says,

590
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,370
陆战队员们 这里就是我们的塔拉瓦
"Marines, this is our Tarawa,

591
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:15,760
均为海陆史上战斗最为惨烈的战区

592
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,760
我们的冲绳  我们的溪山  该我们死战了
this is our Okinawa, this is our Khe Sanh, this is our time.

593
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,140
军士长   威廉姆斯・斯凯莱斯
陆战队 武器训练营

594
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,540
希望费卢杰的野狗饱餐我们死敌的尸体
May the dogs of Fallujah eat hearty off our dead enemy.

595
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,230
这座城我们志在必得
We're gonna take that city on."

596
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,270
瞄准 - 费卢杰

597
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,070
我不管他是耶稣再临
I didn't care if it was the second coming of Christ,

598
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,560
圣诞老人或是复活节兔子  统统靠边
Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny, it didn't matter.

599
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,590
如果他们对我的陆战队兄弟们有威胁
If they were posing a threat to my fellow Marines,

600
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,260
人挡杀人
I was gonna take 'em out.

601
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,540
狙击手
The sniper

602
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
伊森・普雷斯
Ethan Place

603
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,940
费卢杰战场  击杀32人
32 kills, Fallujah.

604
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,940
因英勇作战  获银星勋章
Silver star for gallantry.

605
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,210
射杀区域

606
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,210
约朗高地

607
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,670
这是越战以来最激烈的城市作战
In the fiercest urban combat since Vietnam,

608
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,300
21岁的普雷斯是配属到E连的唯一狙击手
the 21-year-old Marine is the only sniper attached to Echo Company.

609
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,300
绝对是一骑当千
It's one man against thousands.

610
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,570
整座城市像西部片里一样
The city was just like the Wild West.

611
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,220
敌众我寡
We were vastly outnumbered.

612
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,210
如果你跟一个陆战队员嚣张
If you mess up as a Marine sniper,

613
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,240
你会上头版头条的
you're gonna be on the front page of the news,

614
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,020
因为你死定了
because you're gonna be killed.

615
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,770
普雷斯的任务是掩护地面的陆战队
Place's mission-- provide cover for the Marines on the ground

616
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,630
消灭敌军战斗人员和火箭推动榴弹小组
and take out enemy fighters and RPG teams.

617
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,070
他是在风口浪尖上
He is at the tip of the spear.

618
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:41,000
武器:M40A3  陆战队狙击步枪
The weapon: The M40A3, marine sniper rifle.

619
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:45,210
M40A3的北约弹非常具有破坏性
The M40A3's NATO round is devastating.

620
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:50,210
武器型号：M40A3
口径: 7.62X51mm
枪口初速: 每秒2550英尺
最远射程: 1000码

621
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,390
在一千码距上
At a thousand yards,

622
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:51,670
其残余动能比极近距离.357还要高
the bullet has more kinetic energy than a .357 fired at point-blank range.

623
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,530
简而言之  停止力极高
In two words stopping power

624
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,520
作为枪手的猎手  我们用的武器
Being a hunter of gunmen, we use weapons

625
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,690
是彻头彻尾猎杀人专用的
that are built and made to hunt people.

626
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,820
这个步枪型号跟我在费卢杰用的一样
This is the same type of rifle that I used when I was in Fallujah.

627
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,240
这就是陆战队的M40A3狙击步枪
It's the Marine Corp's M40A3 sniper rifle.

628
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,550
尤耐托的瞄镜  10倍率固定
It was a Unertl scope, ten-power fixed.

629
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,520
最大有效射程1000码
Max effective range is a thousand yards.

630
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,120
普雷斯设好了藏身处  或叫最终射击位置
Place sets up his hide, or final firing position,

631
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,320
最终射击位置

632
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,630
显眼地段一幢能俯瞰整条马路的三层楼房
in a prime location,a 3-story building overlooking a long roadway.

633
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,240
他们必须要经过那条主路
They had to move across that main road

634
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,610
才能去路北边找掩护
to get to hides and weapons systems

635
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,720
或是去路北边找武器
that were on the north side of the road,

636
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,040
每当他们要这么做时候  他们都会飞跑
and when they did that, they had to make a dash for their life.

637
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,950
那个时候就是我的机会
That was where you were gonna make your money.

638
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,850
普雷斯通过墙上的弹孔射击  以隐蔽自己的藏身处
Place conceals his location by firing through loopholes,

639
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:50,850
弹孔

640
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,990
这是城市环境下狙击的重要战术
a key tactic in urban sniping.

641
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,640
屋顶上有一堵五尺高的墙
There was about a five-foot wall on top of the roof,

642
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,570
墙上有我们留下的弹孔
and we'd knocked out little holes

643
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,500
大约有半个篮球大小
that were about half the size of a basketball.

644
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,570
我们就往后移10码建立狙击阵位
Then we'd move back about ten yards and set up a shooting position

645
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,260
这样我们能抢占马路的有利位置
that gave us access to the vantage point of that road.

646
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,490
叛乱分子就会
The insurgents, they would have to

647
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,170
依次进入我视野后才可能开枪
line up directly in my sights to take a shot,

648
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,000
这么一来我倒是轻松多了
which I felt very comfortable in that aspect.

649
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,620
那时候他们对我们唯一有威胁的
The only thing that they had an advantage on us at that time was,

650
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,670
是因为我们没有屋顶
because there was no roof on top,

651
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,330
他们就往我们所在发迫击炮
they would just start dropping mortars.

652
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,990
那时候就只能祈祷打不中了
So you just kind of hope one doesn't have your name on it.

653
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,240
普雷斯和观察手标记射杀区域
Place and his spotter "Range the kill zone,"

654
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,950
也就是给显著地标标记距离
Assigning distances to prominent landmarks and terrain features.

655
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,740
标记射杀区域

656
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,130
进了隐蔽点的第一件事情
One of the first things you do when you get into a hide sight is

657
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,490
就是要做射程卡
you start making a range card,

658
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,810
清楚标记好那些大街上
and really milling out targets and things

659
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,190
能给你瞄准距离提供参考的物件或目标
that you know can provide you with yardage up and down the street.

660
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,600
左边被炸毁的建筑离我525码
Blown-up building on the left is at 525,

661
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,500
525码

662
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,300
300码

663
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,840
打烂掉的汽车离我300码  如此以往
or the shot-up car's at 300, so on and so forth.

664
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,890
普雷斯的观察手负责识别目标和间距
Place's spotter i.D.'s targets and their their distance.

665
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,430
狙击手跟观察手之间
You come up with some type of language

666
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,840
有种特定的沟通语言  用来交流距离
between you and your spotter where you can communicate yards.

667
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,200
比如用棒球场的规矩  可以用些体育术语
You can put it in sectors, you can use sports theory--

668
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,770
比如左外野  中外场 
left field, center field--

669
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,980
好让人能够掌握目标的具体位置
to give you an idea of where the target's located.

670
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,220
但当时就是一条笔直的马路  称得上单维
But for us,it was kind of 1-dimensional,straight down an alleyway.

671
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,760
我们那会就用了码数距离标记
And we could just use yard markers at that point.

672
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,460
射杀区域

673
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,800
连起来展现的就是个狙击手的理想国
The targets that it presented was a sniper's dream world.

674
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,370
整个射杀区域长880码
The kill zone is 880 yards long.

675
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,340
我把狙击步枪调节到550码
The range I had my sniper rifle set on was 550 yards.

676
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,660
大约就是场地的中间
It was kind of the center of our kill zone.

677
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,600
当你开始透过瞄镜去看的时候
When you first look down the scope, you can't

678
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,930
禁不住去想那一头是个活生生的人
avoid the fact that it is a human being on the other end of that.

679
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,650
这时候心跳会加快
And that's when your heart starts to race,

680
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,790
这就是人称"扑腾小心肝"的紧张时刻
and you kind of get what they call buck fever.

681
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,630
这个时候就必须要冷静下来
And you have to calm that down and make sure that

682
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,300
重温学过的精确射击培训基本内容
you're going through your fundamentals of marksmanship.

683
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,910
我们受训时总被教导深吸气三次  然后呼气
We were always taught take three big breaths and exhale.

684
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,010
把肺里气都呼出来  但是
You've exhaled all the air out of your lungs and you're not,

685
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,010
战术呼吸

686
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,660
又还没要到吸气的时候
thinking about breathing at that point,

687
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,370
就是人最放松的时刻[即战术呼吸]
that's when you're the most relaxed.

688
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,330
这对于稳定射击平台很有帮助
That's going to keep the most stability in your shooting platform.

689
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,860
扳机控制

690
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,860
一般狙击步枪的扳机扣力约是2.5磅
The trigger pull on most sniper rifles is about 2-and-a-half pounds

691
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,100
只要能保持手指恒定地
So as long as you're consistent with

692
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,340
扣在扳机的同一个位置输出同一个力道
applying that same point of pressure on your finger on that trigger,

693
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,620
就能打得准
you're going to be accurate.

694
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,590
我那会扣扳机扣得都起水泡了
I shot so much that I started getting blisters.

695
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,280
普雷斯牢牢掌握着射杀区域
Place owns the kill zone.

696
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,010
但打偏一发可能就意味着要损失队友
But a missed shot could mean more Marines die on the ground.

697
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,100
他一直守在瞄准镜前
He stays on the scope around the clock.

698
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,630
人说最好只在瞄准镜前看
They say to only be on a scope for

699
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,970
大约30到45分钟  然后就要休息眼睛
about 30 to 45 minutes at a time and then rest your eyes.

700
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,310
可一旦你在伊拉克开了瞄
But when you're in Iraq looking down a scope,

701
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,560
立马就像着了魔一样
it almost becomes something of obsession.

702
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,830
会不想离开瞄镜
You won't come off the scope.

703
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,980
然后就会抓紧每分钟的睡眠时间
And you try to get whatever sleep you can get.

704
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,640
每次就算闭上眼睛了  十字线还在你眼前晃
Anytime you close your eyes, you have a crosshair,

705
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,390
就好象烙在眼球上了一样
which is kind of burned in to your eyeball.

706
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,670
普雷斯的记录  12击杀
Place's kills mount-- 12 dead.

707
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,260
但他面对的是诸多敌人
But he faces an enemy hell-bent

708
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,800
妄图消灭他和他的陆战队弟兄们
on destroying him and his fellow Marines.

709
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,890
叛乱分子开始隔三差五就进行反击
The insurgents started counterattacking about twice a day.

710
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,490
他们开火时身体都暴露在掩体之外
They're very exposed when they're attacking

711
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,970
因为他们老是挑
because they try to take up positions

712
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,570
他们觉得相对安全位置袭击陆战队员们
they feel like are safe to the Marines on the ground,

713
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,060
却不管自己已经暴露了
and that exposes them.

714
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,700
普雷斯的首要目标  解决叛军火箭筒射手
Place's top priority: taking out insurgent RPG gunners.

715
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,060
火箭推进榴弹
[俗称火箭筒]

716
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,120
他们习惯从他们觉得最佳的位置开火
They got comfortable with where they shot the RPGs from,

717
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,680
我们就能在火箭尾焰尽头看到很多目标
We picked up on a lot of targets from the back blast of those rockets.

718
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,320
每次都在同一个位置发射
They would shoot from the same spot,

719
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,770
对于他们  这真不是个好习惯
and that was a bad decision on their part.

720
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,360
普雷斯用的是伏击方式
Place uses the ambush method

721
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,820
狙击手狙击目标时候有两种方式
And there's two ways of engaging a target as a sniper.

722
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,240
一是追踪  就是说
You can track it, which means

723
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,820
把十字线压在目标上跟着走
you put your crosshairs on the target and you follow it.

724
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,210
追踪方式

725
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,160
然后算出合适的提前量再开枪
And you use a proper lead and you shoot it

726
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,060
二就是伏击
or you can ambush it--

727
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,710
伏击方式

728
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,270
就是说你瞄准目标会经过的方向上
you put your scope out in  the direction the target's walking,

729
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,700
等到目标走进视野
and as the target comes into your scope,

730
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,930
就在算好的位置上开火
you fire at the prescribed dope on the weapon.

731
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,560
杀一儆千
"Kill one man, terrorize a thousand."

732
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,890
普雷斯用他的M40A3把火箭筒单位
Place and his M40A3 push RPG teams out

733
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,630
彻底赶出了他们的有效射程
beyond their effective range.

734
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,700
在猎区  他每次扣发
He tightens his grip on the kill zone

735
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,410
都是一记绝杀
with a single, devastating kill shot.

736
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,560
那个目标恰好是515码[471M]
That particular target was right at 515 yards.

737
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,560
515码

738
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,080
普雷斯必须如穿针引线一般
Place must thread the needle, putting a single round

739
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:36,090
在550米距离一击命中一个10英寸的目标
inside a ten-inch target from five football fields away.

740
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,580
我说  我干掉他了
And I just said, "I got him."

741
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,500
我对着喉咙上部开火
I held right at the upper throat and fired.

742
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,580
直接命中了他的下巴  下嘴唇位置
And that hit right in the lower lip, at the jaw,

743
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,070
打破了他的脸  直接贯穿了他的头
went through his face and out the back of his head.

744
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,960
这是我头一个干净利落的狙杀
That was my first clean kill shot.

745
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,020
生理机能瞬间停止
It's instantaneous incapacitation.

746
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,800
世间不再有那么个人
its just seized to exist

747
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,620
没有犹豫  没有不忍  就这样
no flinching, no nerve bendings, its over

748
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,250
要瞄准人的致命T区
You aim for what they call "The Fatal T,"

749
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,060
致命T区

750
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,470
简而言之就是瞄脑干打
And it's to aim for brain's stem base clean.

751
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,900
要是能击中该区域  那人倒地前就已经死了
If you can hit that, he's going to die before he hits the ground.

752
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,900
那会切断整个中枢神经的信号传递
It's going to cut off all signals to the body.

753
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,690
在那片区域我干掉了19个人
I'd had over 19 kills in that area.

754
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,670
尸体就那么留在街上
The dead bodies would lay out in the street,

755
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,930
很多野狗就以那些尸体为食
and there's a lot of wild dogs and they would feed on the bodies.

756
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,340
我坚信  对于叛乱分子这很有震撼力 
And that had a devastating affect, I'm sure, to the insurgents,

757
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,670
眼看着自己战友倒在大街上被野狗啃咬
seeing their friends laying out in street getting chewed on by dog

758
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,600
我刚来的时候  有人跟我说
When I first arrived, someone said,

759
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,570
军士长  过来看看这个
"Hey, First Sarge, come take a look at this."

760
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,240
我透过射击孔看了看
And I looked through his loophole

761
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,640
看到了八具尸体  是敌人的
and I saw eight bodies-- dead bodies of our enemy--

762
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,560
说明无论敌人在玩什么花样  都不能得逞
that, uh, whatever they're trying to do wasn't working,

763
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,990
我回过头看着普雷斯下士  他就笑了笑说
and looking back at Corporal Place, he just kind of smiled and said,

764
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,860
份内活  应该的
"Just doing my job."

765
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,620
人常说狙击手是增幅器
People say snipers are a combat multiplier.

766
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,200
他牢牢掌握着那片区域
He owned that whole area.

767
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,680
击毙19人
19 kills.

768
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,040
普雷斯的神射帮助了陆战队继续深入推进
Place's sharpshooting allows Marines to push further into the city.

769
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,770
战斗依然残酷
But the battle still rages.

770
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,430
他经历的最致命最高难度的战役即将来到
His most difficult and deadly shot is yet to come.

771
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,510
远在狙击手上战场开枪之前
Long before the sniper pulls the trigger on the battlefield,

772
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:25,100
他必须在靶场上掌握各种绝杀技巧
he must master the art of the kill shot on a firing range.

773
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:28,580
考核用的是靶纸  纸是死的人是活的
We'd qualify on these inanimate pieces of paper.

774
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,150
是人就会动
Everyone that's a human being moves.

775
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,450
一旦动了 要打中就很难
It's hard enough to hit somebody when he's like this.

776
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,780
军士长 威廉姆斯・斯凯莱斯
陆战队 武器训练营

777
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,390
没人喜欢上来就打移动靶
No one's gonna be like this for you and say, "Go ahead."

778
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:40,300
所以我们强调针对核心区域  来解决目标
That's why we focus on the core,right here, and put him down.

779
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,760
模拟场景

780
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,460
是人就想打出完美一击
You want to get that perfect shot,

781
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,190
但除非你能命中关键脏器
but if you can hit anywhere in the vital organs,

782
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,630
那才是绝杀
it's gonna be a kill shot.

783
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,830
伊拉克

784
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,570
费卢杰  2004年
Fallujah, 2004.

785
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,570
费卢杰
东经33.3003  北纬43.7717

786
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,640
狙击手  伊森・普雷斯
The sniper: Ethan Place.

787
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,870
四天  击毙19人
Four days, 19 kills.

788
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,620
死尸满大街
Dead bodies litter the street,

789
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,800
给了叛乱分子一个警告  不听话你就是下一个
a warning to insurgents: you could be next.

790
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,790
弹药  7.62北约弹
The ammo: 7.62 Nato rounds,

791
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,330
精度和停止力的完美组合
a deadly combination of accuracy and stopping power.

792
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,860
我们的狙击弹药是7.62X51mm
Our sniper round is 7.62 by 51,

793
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,590
比5.56MM的各型烧药更多
which means it has more powder and

794
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:21,990
而且"子弹更得劲"  我们用的是175格令的弹头
it has more "Ass to the round." We use a 175-grain round,

795
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,180
伊森・普雷斯
前海陆狙击手

796
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,020
这是相对较重的弹头
and that's a fairly heavy round.

797
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,040
弹头越重  停止力就越多
The heavier the grain you go,the more knockdown power it's gonna have

798
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,990
因为是更大的弹头打到了人身上
'cause it's a big round that's impacting that person.

799
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,580
终端弹道有两种效果
You have two aspects of terminal ballistics:

800
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:36,080
终段弹道

801
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,080
・侵彻效应

802
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,080
・空腔效应

803
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,140
侵彻效应和空腔效应
the crush factor and the tear factor of the round.

804
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,440
侵彻效应在于
The crush factor being

805
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,880
侵彻效应

806
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,390
弹头直接作用于身体组织的侵彻杀伤
what the round's gonna eliminate from body

807
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,490
以及它所形成贯通伤道  像这个伤道
and it's gonna pass out, like the exit hole

808
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,410
出口有50分硬币大小
probably the size of a half-dollar.

809
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,240
伤口喷出来的组织是被弹头撕裂挤压粉碎的
The tissue that gets blown out of the body that's just crushed.

810
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,400
空腔杀伤则是指弹丸在人体内时
Then you have a tear factor, which is the tissue

811
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,570
将人体组织撕开造成的杀伤
that is torn by the projectile when it's in, the body.

812
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,580
空腔效应

813
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,850
空腔会有12到18英寸[30-46cm]的深度
The tear factor could be 12 to 18 inches in length,

814
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,180
造成的损伤会非常严重
The damage it's gonna cause, it's gonna be absolutely devastating.

815
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,230
普雷斯的绝杀把叛乱分子又逼回了暗处
Place's kill shots push insurgents back into the shadows.

816
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,030
纵是如此他们也无处藏身
But there is nowhere to hide.

817
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,420
距离就是狙击手的优势
Distance is the sniper's ally.

818
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,910
遗憾的是对于叛乱分子
Unfortunately for a lot of the insurgents,

819
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,270
我们一开火  他们就会往远处退
when we start engaging them, they would move back.

820
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:14,110
但其实在五百码上开枪造成的杀伤效应
If we hit them at 500 yards, it was having higher killing effects

821
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:17,160
要比二三百码上来得更严重
than at 200 or 300 yards, even.

822
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,820
经验法则证实  距离越近
The rule of thumb is that the closer they are,

823
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,660
弹头的速度最高
the bullet's moving at a faster pace, so it's-

824
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,430
杀伤就不够理想
it's not gonna do as much damage.

825
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,430
弹头不在身体里停止  就没把动能全部传递出去

826
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,160
但当他们退远了之后
And as they back off a little bit,

827
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,860
子弹速度不再那么快了
the round's not going too fast.

828
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,300
一头扎进身体里
It just zips through the body.

829
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,490
然后在身体内扩张得更大
It's gonna be able to expand a little bit in the body

830
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,040
造成更多创伤
and cause more damage.

831
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,520
决心警戒行动  第五日
Operation Vigilant Resolve, day five.

832
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,230
费卢杰

833
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,060
战斗日趋激烈  普雷斯更加深入城区
Fighting intensifies and Place pushes further into the city.

834
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,890
他换了一处屋顶紧盯一条叛乱分子的
He takes the fight to the enemy from a new rooftop hide

835
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,020
武器补给线  继续追着敌人打
overlooking a major supply line for insurgent weapons.

836
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,080
东经 33.386069  北纬 43.759543

837
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,980
第二个位置上
The second position,

838
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,850
我们就直接对着一条主要街道
we were looking directly down at a main alleyway.

839
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,980
有很多小街道与之连通
It had a bunch of small alleyways connecting to it

840
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,660
叛乱分子必须不断穿行才能推进和撤退
The insurgents would have to cross to get movement back and forth.

841
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,300
人跑动的速度有时候真的惊人
You'd be surprised how fast some of those guys can run.

842
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,750
我们常开玩笑说  跑得慢的都死光了
We used to joke that the slow ones are all gone.

843
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,170
剩下的都是在食物链顶端的了
So anybody that's left is-is the top of the food chain.

844
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,770
他们真的很快  像风一样
They were fast. They ran like the wind.

845
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,050
这类目标被称为"有限暴露目标"
We call it "Limited exposure targets."

846
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:13,110
有限暴露目标

847
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:15,010
400-500码距上是很难打中一个
Very difficult to hit a running man at 400, 500 yards,

848
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,230
极速穿越街道的人  试着追踪也难
crossing an alley, and try and track him.

849
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,640
几近不可能
Almost impossible.

850
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,340
普雷斯是以解决这些跑动靶出名的
Place was famous for hitting those guys on a dead sprint.

851
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:28,700
一发不中意味着更多的海陆兄弟会有危险
A missed shot means an insurgent lives on to fight and kill more Marines

852
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,480
在同胞的生命有危险的情况下  普雷斯遇到了
With American lives at stake, Place is confronted with

853
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,680
一个令狙击手最头疼的高难度狙击之一
one of the most difficult shots a sniper will ever face.

854
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,490
他只有不到两秒来击倒疯狂逃命的敌人
He has less than two seconds to hit a man on a dead run,

855
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,660
还是在相隔660米的距离上
six football fields away.

856
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,020
有个穿白袍的男的  穿着拖鞋
There was man in a white outfit, sandals on,

857
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,660
带着AK-47  探头探脑偷看好一会了
AK-47, and he'd been turkey-peeking back and forth.

858
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,630
他正透过一扇
He was looking through a black door

859
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,560
敞开着的黑门观察着
that they had that was swung open outside a house.

860
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,650
我觉得他没意识到
And I don't think he understood

861
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,750
我能看见他的头和他拿的什么武器
that we could see his head and could identify a weapon.

862
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,030
在他起跑横穿的时候
Right as he started to dash across,

863
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,250
我就已经瞄好了
I was able to get a good mil-hold, fire

864
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,040
打出了膛中的子弹
and the round carried and hit him

865
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,160
直接命中了他的脸部上方
right in the upper part of the face.

866
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,290
这是瞬间机能停止击杀
It was immediate incapacitation shot,

867
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,150
他倒地前就已经死了
killed him before he hit the ground.

868
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,110
不到两秒
In less than two seconds,

869
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,570
普雷斯干掉了600码距上逃命的叛乱分子
Place takes out the sprinting insurgent from 600 yards.

870
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,140
这种类型的射击最难之处
Well, the most difficult thing about those type of shots

871
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:25,070
提前量

872
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,970
在于计算物体当时的运动速度
is trying to guess the speed in which the target's target's moving.

873
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:29,130
常见目标速度在8.6M/H[13.84Km/H]
The average sprinting target moves at 8.6 miles per hour.

874
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:29,130
目标速度
8.6M/H

875
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,240
要补足这个差距  普雷斯必须要
To compensate for this, Place must

876
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,350
瞄在他跑动方向前方的一段距离上
aim several feet in front of the running insurgent.

877
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,130
这就是所谓的提前量
this is known as Leading the Target

878
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,290
要打移动靶
If we have a running target,

879
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,340
不能把瞄准线的中心十字压在目标靶上
you're not holding the crosshairs of the reticle on the target,

880
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,030
而是要根据单体跑动方向的不同
so the reticle may be to the right or the left of the individual,

881
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,000
准心应适当偏左或是偏右
depending upon where they're running.

882
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,480
这样当你扣下扳机后
And when you squeeze the trigger,

883
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,990
他们就是在往你打出的子弹上跑
they're gonna basically run into the bullet.

884
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,080
那个距离即提前量  是用密位来表示的
The distance, or lead, is measured in mils.

885
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,070
密位点

886
00:41:54,620 --> 00:42:04,570
21英寸

887
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,930
600码距上  一个密位大概代表21英寸
At 600 yards, one mil represents roughly 21 inches.

888
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,940
我当时针对跑过街的目标给出的提前量
The lead that I led the individual that was coming across the street

889
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,090
是在右方4.5个密位左右
was right at about four-and-a-half mils,

890
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:06,300
相当大的了
which is a-- that's a pretty, big lead.

891
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,220
再大的话
Anything more than that,

892
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,880
瞄准镜就没办法了
you're really stretching the capabilities of the scope.

893
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,970
600码距上4.5密位
A four-and-a-half- mil lead at 600 yards

894
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,880
相当于在目标前的八尺
means Place must aim eight feet in front of the target.

895
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,670
八尺

896
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,670
两尺

897
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,090
偏了一个密位  就是偏了两英尺[61CM]
If he's off by one mil, he misses by two feet.

898
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,580
以2550尺每秒的速度
Traveling at 2,550 feet per second,

899
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,160
175格令的弹头钻入颅腔
the 175-grain round enters the cranial cavity,

900
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,070
在150万分之一秒内切断了脑干
severing the brain stem in one-half millionth of a second.

901
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,390
我在观察镜里看到了这下  砰
In my scope, I witnessed that one shot-- boomp.

902
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:42,240
人倒下了  枪也掉了  一动不动
This lump of crap fell, weapon fell, no movement.

903
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,550
他就是这般致命
That's how deadly he was.

904
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,590
从此再没人敢从那位置出来
And no one ever came out of that position again.

905
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,060
20天  击杀32人
30 days, 32 kills.

906
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,800
伊森・普雷斯在费卢杰扮演了重要角色
Ethan Place plays a critical role in the fight for Fallujah.

907
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,940
他的神射挽救了无数海陆同袍
His sharpshooting saves countless Marines

908
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,420
并把恐慌的阴影带给了叛乱分子和火箭筒队
and wreaks havoc on insurgent fighters and RPG teams.

909
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,580
他们走上谈判桌
When they came to the negotiation table,

910
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,480
第一件事就是要求撤出所有的狙击手
one of the first things they wanted was the snipers to be pulled back.

911
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,430
固然是因为我们消灭威胁很在行
We were extremely effective at eliminating threats.

912
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,950
更因为我们的子弹神出鬼没
But the ability not to know where or when it's coming,

913
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,030
那真是让他们很绝望
uh, just was devastating on them.

914
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,400
他获得了银星勋章
He received a Silver Star.

915
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,020
这位先生帮了我们连很大忙
That gentleman saved our bacon a lot,

916
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,080
他始终掌握那个区域
but he owned that whole area.

917
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,380
海陆狙击手学校  弗吉尼亚州  匡提科 
Marine Sniper School-- Quantico, Virginia.

918
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,930
那次费卢杰600码绝杀之后5年
Five years after his 600-yard kill shot in Fallujah,

919
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,020
伊森・普雷斯与军士长比尔・斯凯尔斯重聚首
Ethan Place reunites with Sergeant Major Bill Skiles

920
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,210
试着再现当日辉煌
to try and duplicate the feat.

921
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,720
这里零度以下的环境跟在伊拉克截然相反
The subfreezing conditions are the extreme opposite of those in Iraq,

922
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,590
对这位前狙击手来说是很大的挑战
providing the ultimate test for the former sniper.

923
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,170
这里是弗吉尼亚匡提科  600码距线
We're at the 600-yard line here in Quantico, Virginia.

924
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,810
准备用600码距上的两个正面靶
Trying to simulate down the range of 600 yards of

925
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:55,620
模拟当时街道两旁的建筑
two target  fronts that simulates parts of buildings,

926
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,250
并再现当时的敌人穿越的情景
and to simulate how our enemy would run across our lines

927
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,160
身后这位一级棒的美国人
and this great American behind you

928
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,490
会用子弹截停标靶给你看
would intercept them sometimes with bullets.

929
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,150
准备好了没
You ready?

930
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,000
好得不能再好
Ready as one can be.

931
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,540
手指都没感觉了
Can't feel my fingers.

932
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,500
跟费卢杰大不同吧
Little different from, uh, Fallujah, huh?

933
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,610
是
Yeah.

934
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,430
那里可没下雪
Sure it wasn't snowing there

935
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:18,930
在伊拉克  普雷斯的作业环境都是华氏120度以上
In Iraq, Place worked in temperatures in excess of 120 degrees.

936
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,410
高温下弹丸速度更快  打得更远
Hotter rounds flew further and faster.

937
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:24,120
现在  普雷斯的射击环境也很复杂
Here, Place's shot is complicated by

938
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,880
气温低于华氏0度  风速达每小时15英里  
subfreezing temperatures and a 15-mile-per- hour wind.

939
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,480
风速
15英里\小时

940
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,760
他开始校准将步枪的弹着点调整至600码
He gets on target or zeroes his rifle for 600 yards point of impact.

941
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,820
长时间暴露于高温或寒冷环境下
Prolonged exposure to heat or cold

942
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,550
校准步枪

943
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,550
子弹的角分  即弹道属性会有重大改变
can alter a bullet's minute of angle, or trajectory.

944
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:43,240
600码距  20度温差足以增加空气密度
At 600 yards,20-degree drop in temperature can increase air density

945
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,990
从而导致弹丸向下偏离6英寸
causing a bullet to miss its target low by six inches.

946
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:51,410
对于狙击手  这一偏差足以决定生死
For a sniper, that could be the difference between life and death.

947
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,780
现在  我来为他报告风速风向
Now, I will call his wind for him.

948
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,630
我们要模拟一个在两建筑之间跑动的人
We're gonna simulate a running man between the two target frames.

949
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,080
首先从右向左开始
We're gonna go right to left first,

950
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,270
然后从左向右  来回几次再交换
then left to right, do a couple passes each.

951
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,280
为防预判  我们增加了变化
can't just lead, so we get his hits

952
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,510
与在费卢杰相似  普雷斯将只有
Just like Fallujah, Place will have less than

953
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,690
不到两秒时间射击600码之外的目标
two seconds to hit the target at 600 yards.

954
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,070
开始放靶
Go ahead and run them.

955
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:10,760
准备就绪
Stand by.

956
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,430
可以放靶
Go ahead and start running.

957
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:20,890
从子弹消失的轨迹来看
By the vapor trail, looked like

958
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,770
子弹似乎从他右肩上掠过
it appeared to be-- went over his right shoulder.

959
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,960
普雷斯偏离了目标身后仅几英寸
Place misses just behind the target by a few inches.

960
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,800
准备下一枪  上一枪他预判目标从右向左
This time,he was supposed to come right to left last time.

961
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,990
现在如我所料他继续预判从右向左
Now he's gonna go right to left like I wanted.

962
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,200
风速
17英里\小时

963
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,200
风速渐起  增加了普雷斯第二枪的难度
The wind picks up, complicating Place's second shot.

964
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,770
他必须减少提前量
He must decrease his lead so

965
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:38,480
不至于射偏到目标前方
he doesn't miss wide in front of the target.

966
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,310
这枪提前量增加3个密位  可以吗
Get about a three-mil lead this time, all right?

967
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,900
因为上一枪瞄得太靠后了
'Cause you're trailing a little bit.

968
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,040
正中靶心

969
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,040
正中靶心  伊森你看到没
You're dead center, Ethan-- you see it?

970
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:57,820
是的
Yeah.

971
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,220
正中靶心  伙计们
That was dead center, guys.

972
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,890
仅用时1.3秒  普雷斯正中目标胸部
In 1.3 seconds, Place hits the target in the chest.

973
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,150
一枪也许是走运  再打一枪看看
Hey, one shot's lucky-- do it again.

974
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:07,360
让他们放靶  你再打一枪
Tell them to pull it out so you can do it again.

975
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:08,570
右边
Right edge.

976
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,300
开始放靶
Go ahead and run it.

977
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,290
风速稳定
Wind's good.

978
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,520
由于目标从相反方向开始运动
With the target moving in the opposite direction,

979
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:17,410
普雷斯增加提前量补偿风速造成的偏差
Place increases his lead to compensate for the wind.

980
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,450
肾脏部位

981
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,510
命中  
A hit

982
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,490
这类目标被称为"有限暴露目标"
Again, it's called Limited Exposure Targets.

983
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,820
在战场上  有许多我们的敌人
Overseas, we had many of our bad guys

984
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,240
试图冲过火线来运送武器弹药  补给
that want to run or sprint across with supplies, with weaponry.

985
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,000
有时只暴露一两秒钟的时间
Sometimes we only have a one-second, two-second exposure.

986
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,900
这一次他出现然后开始冲刺
That time, he came up, started sprinting.

987
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,160
600码外伊森在第一秒就干掉了他
Ethan knocked him down in the first second at 600 yards.

988
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,480
射中了他的肾脏
Got him in the kidney.

989
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:43,590
干得好
Toast.

990
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,340
两发两中  太棒了
Two hits, two shots. That's awesome.

991
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,370
退弹
Unload.

992
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:48,990
威风不减当年
It's like old times.

993
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:50,560
第二枪的感觉相当好
Well, the second one felt real good.

994
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:51,890
你感觉怎样
How you doing?

995
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,140
很好
Good.

996
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,690
你看这里我的第一枪  正中靶心  
You see up here the first shot that I hit was dead on.

997
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,460
质心

998
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,870
在600码的距离上  绝对是致命一击
It was 600 yards. That'll be a devastating kill.

999
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:02,800
估计没一两分钟那家伙就死了
Probably take just a minute or two for them to pass away,

1000
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:05,220
但第二枪  我打得有些偏
but the second shot, I was a little off.

1001
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,280
风速对我有一点影响
Uh, the wind probably effected it a little bit.

1002
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,040
肾脏上部

1003
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,240
这一枪有点偏  不过击中了肾脏上部
It was a little bit of a trail shot, but it'd be more upper kidney shot,

1004
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,980
在这一距离上仍足以致命
and that's still gonna be a devastating shot at those ranges.

1005
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,790
目标没你希望的那样密集  但设想一下
Not the tightest group you'd hope for, but still, at the same time,

1006
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,160
两枪皆致命  你还是击杀2个目标
considering, two kill shots, you're still gonna have two kills.

1007
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,460
他精确射击的基本功没有退化
His fundamentals of marksmanship, he has not lost it.

1008
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,610
他的基本功从枪械到肩膀乃至整个躯干
His own fundamentals of weapon to shoulder, and his own body,

1009
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:28,000
包括他的呼吸  脉搏  
his breathing, his pulse,

1010
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,600
他对瞄准  提前量和击发时机的掌握
his delivery, his eyes, his lead--

1011
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,160
他仍然出类拔萃  
that's what is phenomenal, he still has.

1012
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,480
好想念这种味道
I miss that smell a lot.

1013
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,780
就这么点爱好
Love that.

1014
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,650
一上瘾就戒不掉
Gets addicting, and you miss it.

1015
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,060
离开费卢杰战火弥漫的街巷  回到越南战场
From the war-torn streets of Fallujah to the killing fields of Vietnam,

1016
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:55,400
一代传奇狙击手与其死敌针锋相对
a legendary sniper goes head-to-head with a deadly foe.

1017
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,770
应该说  我开枪是最快的
By looks of things, I was just the quickest on the trigger.

1018
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,290
否则被干掉的就是我了
Otherwise, he'd have killed me.

1019
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:09,880
以下节目含有暴力情节  不适合青少年观众
请慎重观看

1020
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,830
敌方狙击手是我的梦魇  因为
My worst nightmare is an enemy sniper, and the reason for that is,

1021
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:17,160
狙击手是战场上最致命的武器
a sniper is the most deadly weapon on the battlefield.

1022
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,870
他可以埋伏一整天
He can wait there all day.

1023
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,160
时机若未出现
The situation doesn't present itself,

1024
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,690
他明天还会再来
he comes back tomorrow to get you.

1025
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,410
他只需赌赢一次即可
He only has to get lucky once.

1026
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,390
可以这样讲  这是军人之间的
The bottom line is, it's the ultimate challenge

1027
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:28,970
终极对决
as far as soldiering is concerned.

1028
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:31,250
一对一的决斗
It's just you against somebody else.

1029
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,110
猎杀眼镜蛇

1030
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,940
越南  1966年
Vietnam, 1966.

1031
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,940
越南  1966年

1032
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,080
我其实并不喜欢杀人
I really didn't like to kill.

1033
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,820
模拟场景

1034
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,690
但当你深入险境去寻歼一个
But to pit myself against another living, breathing human being

1035
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:03,390
与你旗鼓相当的狙击手时
who could kill me just as quick as I could him--

1036
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,170
这才称得上是挑战
that was the challenge of it.

1037
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,750
狙击手  卡洛斯・哈斯库克  海军陆战队传奇射手
The sniper: Carlos Hathcock, Marine Corps legend.

1038
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,400
狙击手
卡洛斯・哈斯库克
确认毙敌93人  
海军陆战队传奇

1039
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,220
射杀区域  55号高地
The hunting ground: Hill 55.

1040
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,310
北越

1041
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,310
南越

1042
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,930
55号高地
北纬  15.92度  东经  108.16度

1043
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:19,700
我们已歼灭了那一区域大部分敌方狙击手
We had eliminated most of the enemy snipers in that area.

1044
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,300
爱德华・J・兰德
前美国海军陆战队少校

1045
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:24,000
情报部的同事告诉我们
The intelligence folks had told us that

1046
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,730
有个家伙被派来挑战我们
someone was being sent down to challenge us.

1047
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:31,110
仅知其代号为  眼镜蛇
The sniper is known only as The Cobra.

1048
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,590
若能击毙哈斯库克  他就能得到3万美元赏金
If he kills Hathcock, he collects a $30,000 bounty.

1049
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:38,490
北越专程派个狙击手来杀我
This North Vietnamese sniper was sent down there to get me,

1050
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:38,390
卡洛斯・哈斯库克  1983年采访资料片段

1051
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,410
这让我很不爽
which I really didn't appreciate.

1052
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,710
眼镜蛇游弋于55号高地附近
The Cobra stalks Hill 55,

1053
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:47,900
那是陆战队1师狙击学校的大本营
home base for the 1st Division Marine Scout, Sniper School.

1054
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,100
这一枪是他向哈斯库克下的战书
With one shot, he issues a challenge to Hathcock:

1055
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:56,190
出来一决高下
Come and get me.

1056
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,590
对方敢把枪杆子伸我家门口来
The killer gunner's setting right outside my door of my hooch.

1057
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,900
结果就是被我送上西天
And, uh, I watched him die.

1058
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,530
我发了毒誓要干掉他  不惜一切
Took a vow, right then, I was gonna get him somehow or another.

1059
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,930
他在离我们营地1000码的地域活动
He was operating about 1,000 yards outside the wire.

1060
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,360
他会沿运河顺流而下
He would come down a canal.

1061
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,700
借着黑暗进入到狙击位置
During low light, he would crawl into his position.

1062
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:24,550
就是他设埋伏的地方
That's where he was living, hanging his hat.

1063
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,220
卡洛斯要去那把他毙了
Carlos wanted to go to get him.

1064
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,730
那一枪之后  我叫上我的搭档约翰・伯克
When he started shooting, I got John Burke, who was my partner,

1065
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,450
我们一起去猎杀他
and we went out, and out-trailed him.

1066
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,650
他是个很机敏很聪明的家伙
Very cagey, very smart individual.

1067
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:38,030
我意识到他也很高杆
And I figured he was close to being as good as I was,

1068
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,230
仅次于我了
but there ain't no way.

1069
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,990
毫无疑问我才是最棒的
Ain't nobody that good.

1070
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,690
哈斯库克和伯克一连追踪了眼镜蛇两天
Hathcock and Burke track the Cobra for two days.

1071
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,100
他们在泥地上发现了许多脚印
They discover muddy footprints

1072
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,730
并继续向丛林腹地深入
and push deeper into the jungle.

1073
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:52,540
一场生死攸关的猫鼠游戏悄然开始
A deadly game of cat and mouse, is underway.

1074
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,240
人云  以毒攻毒  以暴制暴
They say it takes a crook to catch a crook.

1075
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,180
以狙击手来消灭狙击手
It takes a sniper to neutralize a sniper.

1076
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,910
一个了解敌手
The sniper that knows more about his enemy

1077
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:05,000
马克・斯宾塞
英军退役军士长

1078
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,990
远胜于对方了解自己的狙击手
than his enemy knows about him,

1079
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:05,940
才是这场生死游戏的最终赢家
he is gonna be the man that wins

1080
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:09,260
哈斯库克寻找着眼镜蛇留下的蛛丝马迹
Hathcock looks for signs of the Cobra.

1081
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,240
从折断的树枝到踏过的草地
Anything from broken twigs and grass

1082
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,390
再从脚印到碾过的青苔
to footprints and crushed lichen.

1083
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:17,330
这是追猎  即人员追踪的基本要领
Basic elements of the hunt, or man-tracking.

1084
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,830
人员追踪

1085
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,900
狙击手都接受过寻找蛛丝马迹的训练
Snipers are trained to find the minute details.

1086
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,940
哪怕是一片区域的颜色异常
If there is just the wrong color,

1087
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,480
伴有成簇的树叶
within a certain area of foliage,

1088
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,680
狙击手也需要查个一清二楚
you've got to start asking yourself why is that.

1089
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,990
这极有可能是敌方狙击手露出的马脚
And that could be the one thing that gives the sniper away.

1090
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:35,220
每一丝风吹草动  甚至气味
Every breeze, every insect, every smell

1091
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:39,050
都要察觉到并加以思索
immediately goes into your computer, your mind,

1092
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,640
你要有能力去分析这些
and you're able to analyze it

1093
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,410
并作出判断  得出结论
and come up with a decision as to what it means.

1094
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:51,660
对卡洛斯  这几乎成为了他的本能
In Carlos's case, he was able to do that almost instinctively.

1095
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,560
眼镜蛇的行踪有些过于暴露了
The tracks left by the Cobra are a little too obvious.

1096
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,470
哈斯库克察觉到了圈套
Hathcock smells a trap.

1097
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:01,850
他和伯克以狙击手低身位匍匐前进
He and Burke drop into a sniper low crawl,

1098
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,000
狙击手低身位

1099
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,740
每次前进4英寸
moving forward four inches at a time.

1100
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,490
你所做的每一件事必须经过深思熟虑
Everything you do has to be extremely well thought out,

1101
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,970
然后缓慢地施行
and normally very slowly carried out.

1102
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,400
追猎向丛林深处发展
The hunt moves further into the jungle.

1103
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,050
哈斯库克深知就在前方某处
Hathcock knows that somewhere out there,

1104
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,560
眼镜蛇正严阵以待
the Cobra is watching and waiting.

1105
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:21,550
气氛会十分紧张
There is that heightened tension.

1106
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,040
那种无形的压力不断折磨着你的神经
There's an inbuilt level of stress that is constantly there.

1107
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,210
你的感官似乎突然灵敏起来
Your senses are kind of heightened.

1108
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,610
你会比从前对声音更为敏感
You're listening harder than maybe you would do before.

1109
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,770
当两个优秀的狙击手互相寻歼对方时
If you've got another professional that's hunting you down,

1110
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:35,150
这其实就是一场谁先犯错的博弈
and it really is a competition of who's gonna make the first mistake,

1111
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:38,240
以及你的失误是否暴露给了对方
and whether you're in a position to spot that mistake.

1112
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,820
眼镜蛇出洞了
The Cobra is on the move.

1113
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:46,640
他偷偷潜过哈斯库克右翼试图伏击
He sneaks around Hathcock's right flank for an ambush.

1114
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,920
两个顶尖狙击手在不断试图
It was the case of two very, very good soldiers

1115
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,200
猜透对方的企图
constantly trying to outthink each other.

1116
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,680
一条折断的树枝暴露了眼镜蛇的位置
A snapped twig gives away the Cobra's position.

1117
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,870
哈斯库克和伯克迅速寻找掩护
Hathcock and Burke sprint for cover.

1118
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,710
接下来  哈斯库克犯了一个错误
The next mistake is made by Hathcock.

1119
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,710
几乎使他葬送了性命
It nearly gets him killed.

1120
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:15,040
我从一棵朽木上跌了下来  他开了枪
I fell in an old rotted tree, and he made a shot.

1121
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,110
伯克和我都以为他自己中弹了
Burke and I both thought he was hit.

1122
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,600
我发现他水壶被打了个洞
I noticed a hole in his canteen.

1123
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,530
我说  你没事  知道吗
I said, "You ain't hurt. You know?

1124
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,010
你没受伤  不过你水壶开花了
"You ain't hurt. This just killed a devil bloody canteen, that's all."

1125
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:28,530
没等哈斯库克还击
Before Hathcock can return fire,

1126
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,160
眼镜蛇消失在了丛林之中
the Cobra vanishes into the jungle.

1127
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,480
他一路狂奔
He started running.

1128
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,440
坏蛋夹着尾巴逃了  就是这样
The bad guy started running.Yeah.

1129
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,630
我们继续四处搜索
And we moseyed around and mangled around,

1130
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:42,040
我们运动到了他原来的位置
and we worked around to where I was in his old spot.

1131
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,990
他也来到了我之前的位置
He was in my old spot.

1132
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,520
两个狙击手之间只有不到300码的距离
Less than 300 yards separate the snipers.

1133
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,970
猎手和猎物最终正面对决
The hunter and the hunted are finally face to face.

1134
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,390
那时候正好是下午
By then-- it was afternoon--

1135
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,960
对他有所不利  因为他面朝太阳
which was a bad thing for him, 'cause he was facing the sun.

1136
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,300
我猜是阳光射到他的镜片上闪了一下
The sun glinted off his lens of his scope, I guess.

1137
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:29,770
于是我朝闪光处开了枪
I shot it where the glint was.

1138
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:31,750
时机恰到好处
It just happened to be the right time.

1139
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,660
就当时而言  我开枪的速度是最快的
By the looks of things, I was just the quickest on the trigger.

1140
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,860
否则  死的就是我了
Otherwise, he'd have killed me.

1141
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,690
我是怎么知道他有机会杀我的
How do I know he would have killed me?

1142
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:43,420
因为我一枪打穿了他的瞄准镜
'Cause I shot right through his scope,

1143
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,350
直直穿过他的瞄准镜  连镜壁都没碰
right straight through his scope, didn't touch the sides.

1144
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,990
空心穿过
Didn't touch the sides.

1145
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:51,060
他没能抓住机会杀我  那他也就没机会活命了    
He didn't do it in our side, no good in his side either.

1146
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:57,400
这枪正中右眼  连右半个脑袋也打掉了
Yeah, it hit him in the eye and took off the right side of his head.

1147
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,140
距离300码  哈斯库克一枪
At 300 yards, Hathcock fired directly

1148
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,130
正中眼镜蛇的苏制PU瞄准镜
into the Cobra's Soviet-made PU scope.

1149
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,490
这种情形只有当两名狙击手的枪
The shot is only possible if both snipers' weapons

1150
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:09,810
径直瞄准对方时才有可能出现
are pointing directly at one another.

1151
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,830
那个瞄准镜口径大概有25美分硬币大小
I would say the scope was about the size of a quarter.

1152
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:18,650
长度约5英尺半  钢制镜身
Those scopes were about five and a half inches long, steel body,

1153
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:24,310
苏制PU瞄准镜

1154
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:23,340
仅由一组物镜和目镜构成
and they're just an objective lens and an observation lens.

1155
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:27,690
一道敌人物镜反射出的阳光
It came down to a reflective light ray off the enemy's objective lens.

1156
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:31,150
原因可能很简单  由于疲劳
That could have been something as simple as fatigue

1157
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,930
或者片刻的分神
or just a momentary lapse of concentration

1158
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:37,700
使他忘记了阳光照射的不断移动
where he forgot to focus on the fact that the sun is constantly moving.

1159
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,550
万里挑一的经典狙杀
One-in-a-million shot.

1160
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:43,880
他击中敌人并不稀奇
It's not dumb luck that he hit the enemy,

1161
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,530
经典的是他一枪穿过了敌人的瞄准镜
but for it to go down the scope was just luck.

1162
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,690
43年后  另一名海军陆战队狙击手准备再现
43 years later, another Marine sniper sets out to replicate

1163
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:58,490
卡洛斯・哈斯库克这万里挑一的一击
Carlos Hathcock's one-in-a-million shot.

1164
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:02,430
美国田纳西州孟菲斯  T1G战术训练基地

1165
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:07,270
狙击手史蒂夫・瑞切特  美国海军陆战队退役上士
The sniper: Staff sergeant Steve Reichert, US MC Retired.

1166
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,110
这个假人名叫死鬼弗雷德
Our mannequin's name is Dead Fred.

1167
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,450
T1G基地CEO
前海军陆战队上士  Steve Reichert

1168
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:11,370
我们想做一次射击试验
What we're trying to do is set up a shot

1169
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:14,610
模拟卡洛斯・哈斯库克在越南那一枪
simulating what Carlos Hathcock did in Vietnam,

1170
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:17,330
将子弹射穿瞄准镜
where he sent his round on through the scope,

1171
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,000
然后打进目标的脑袋
into the brain housing group.

1172
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,330
史蒂夫用的是海军陆战队M40A1狙击步枪
Steve is using the M40A1 Marine sniper rifle.

1173
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,780
.308口径雷明顿枪弹
The round is Remington .308 caliber.

1174
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,600
这种子弹在1,000码处的动能
This round, at 1,000 yards,

1175
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,720
比.357在抵近射击位置射击时还大
has more kinetic energy than a .357 at point blank.

1176
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:37,710
瞄准镜应在他眼睛前方约3英寸处
So this needs to be about three inches in front of his eye.

1177
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,250
这家伙有点僵硬
Guy's got a little bit of rigor mortis.

1178
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:42,600
瑞切特距目标30码
Reichert is at 30 yards,

1179
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:44,560
与哈斯库克300码的射距相比
but the difference in the speed of the round

1180
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,550
子弹速度差别不大  可以忽略不计
is negligible from Hathcock's 300-yard shot.

1181
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:52,090
子弹将以近2,550英尺每秒的速度击中瞄准镜
The bullet will hit the scope at nearly 2,550 feet per second.

1182
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:53,080
准备就绪
Going hot.

1183
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,230
瑞切特将试射各种瞄准镜
Reichert will experiment with various scopes

1184
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:59,220
并比较每次射击的子弹轨迹与终端弹道
to compare the flight path and terminal ballistics of each shot.

1185
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,640
瑞切特的第一个标靶是个可调倍率瞄准镜
Reichert's first target is a modern-day variable power scope.

1186
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,950
子弹没有从另一端射出来
Eh, it didn't come out the back end.

1187
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,800
里面有一些子弹碎片
There's some bullet fragments, there.

1188
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:23,110
看上去子弹是留在瞄准镜内了
It appears to be the bullet actually stopped inside the scope.

1189
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,880
这里也有一些子弹碎片
There's still some bullet fragments in there.

1190
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:28,590
看来当子弹射中第一片镜片时
So as that bullet hit the first lens,

1191
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:32,420
它大概就开始变形破裂
it probably started to jag, started to tear off.

1192
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,590
弹头的铅核开始碎裂
The lead core started to rip up.

1193
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,570
如果你是瞄准镜后面那家伙
If you were the guy behind that scope right now,

1194
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:40,140
此刻大概会有一脸的碎玻璃和一个黑眼圈
you'd probably have a lot of glass in your face and a black eye,

1195
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,330
不过还活着  还能再上战场
but you'd live to fight another day.

1196
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,820
一枪  一个黑眼圈
One shot, one black eye.

1197
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,230
瑞切特又安好一个瞄准镜  要再试一次
Reichert sets up another scope for a second attempt.

1198
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,130
第二枪也没能击穿瞄准镜
The second shot fails to make it through the scope.

1199
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:00,160
我们刚才打的是两个现代的变倍瞄准镜
The scopes we're shooting now are modern variable power scopes.

1200
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,350
里面有更多的镜片
They have a lot more lenses,

1201
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,430
以及更多的内部构件
basically a lot more internal components.

1202
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:05,590
那次卡洛斯射穿的瞄准镜
The scope Carlos shot into that day

1203
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:07,750
苏制PU瞄准镜

1204
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:10,340
只有大概一两个镜片  不像这两个瞄准镜那么多
probably had one or two lenses but not as many as these scopes.

1205
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,870
当子弹击中第一片玻璃时
When that round hits the first piece of glass,

1206
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:15,110
弹头就开始变形
it's going to start to deform the bullet.

1207
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:16,730
我们用的这枚全金属被甲弹
It's a full metal jacket like we just shot--

1208
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:20,010
遇到了更多阻力  受到更多物体的阻挡
encountered more resistance, impacted more objects,

1209
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,250
来到这里时
came back here,

1210
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:24,490
击穿了更多镜片  此时弹丸速度已经很慢了
hit more lenses, and by then it was traveling slow enough

1211
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:28,080
以至无法再击穿后端的玻璃了
not to even break the glass on the back end.

1212
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,600
我们换个现代的内红点瞄准镜再试一次
We'll try it again with a, a modern red dot scope.

1213
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,270
在尺寸和内部结构上
In size and internal setup,

1214
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:38,410
它与哈斯库克射穿的PU瞄准镜十分相似
it's very similar to the PU scope Carlos Hathcock shot through

1215
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:41,930
也许在中间会多一个镜片
with the addition of maybe one extra lens right in the center.

1216
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:43,830
这次用这个瞄准镜  也许我们运气会好些
We might have better luck with this scope.

1217
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,770
这次好像行了
That one looked like it worked.

1218
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,600
子弹击中第一个镜头  破碎不算太厉害
It hit the first lens, broke up not too much,

1219
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,900
外壳有些开裂
the jacket started to come apart,

1220
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:14,160
射穿第二个镜片后击中眼睛上部
punched out the second lens and right above the eye.

1221
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,630
你可以看出  弹头铅核基本完好
You can see that the lead core was pretty much intact.

1222
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:17,860
它贯穿了头部
It went through the head.

1223
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,630
从后脑射出后继续飞行
Punched through the head on the back end here, kept on going.

1224
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,600
这家伙肯定死翘了
This guy would be more than dead.

1225
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,810
如果这是个真人
If this would have been a real person,

1226
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:28,690
他的颅内组织会喷溅而出  我们称之为爆头
he would have complete cranial evacuation. We call it a canoe.

1227
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,050
基本上他的脑袋会开花
Basically his head would have popped open

1228
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:34,240
而此刻我大概能直接往他脖子里看了
and I'd probably be looking straight down his neck right now.

1229
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:36,890
是啊  一塌糊涂
Yeah, a little bit messy.

1230
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:40,360
卡洛斯碰到的那个PU瞄准镜和这个类似
The scope he encountered-- the PU scope-- it was similar to this,

1231
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,570
而他又是个神射手
and Carlos being an outstanding marksman,

1232
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,770
在这次试射之后我确信无疑
I have no doubt after doing this that

1233
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:48,920
卡洛斯那一枪绝对是可行的
the shot Carlos pulled off was definitely doable.

1234
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:58,480
一枪  击破瞄准镜  击毙眼镜蛇
One shot, one shattered scope, one dead Cobra.

1235
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:02,190
这是哈斯库克传奇人生中的又一辉煌
Another chapter in the legendary life of Carlos Hathcock.

1236
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,610
这并非取人性命的艺术
It isn't the art of taking someone's life.

1237
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,950
对我来说  这关乎能救多少陆战队员的性命
To me it's how many Marines we can save.

1238
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:12,340
如果你有可能对我们造成危害
We will pick the time and place to do harm to you

1239
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:15,210
我们会择机先干掉你
if you have premonition to do harm to us.

1240
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,630
第一次对准活人扣动扳机时
First time I pulled the trigger on a live person,

1241
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:20,530
我从没有考虑过结果
I never thought about the consequences.

1242
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:22,340
当时就是怕搞砸了
I was basically just afraid not to screw up.

1243
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:23,680
我不能射失目标
I didn't want to miss.

1244
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,930
那可是实战的场合
This is a live situation.

1245
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:27,750
如果我搞砸了  战友就会送命
If I screw up, people die around you.

1246
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:42,590
一英里远距狙杀

1247
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,910
伊拉克  Lutayfiyah  2004年4月9日
Lutayfiyah, Iraq--April 9, 2004.

1248
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,010
伊拉克

1249
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:47,510
路特菲亚
东经44.368北纬32.989

1250
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:52,900
F连14名陆战队员在通往路特菲亚的路上巡查
14 Fox Company Marines patrol the roadway into Lutayfiyah.

1251
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:57,830
他们的任务是搜寻路边炸弹及叛军
Their mission: Look for roadside bombs and insurgents.

1252
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,460
美军巡逻队

1253
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,710
一名海军陆战队狙击手和他的观察手
A Marine and his spotter overwatch

1254
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:05,630
在1,000码外的的一个油罐顶上执行掩护
the patrol from atop an oil tank 1,000 yards away.

1255
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,060
我在其中一个油罐顶上设好了观察点
I had set up a little observation post atop one of the towers,

1256
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:13,170
这样我们就能俯看市区的风吹草动
so we could look down into the city, see what's going on,

1257
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:16,260
看是否有人走动  查找可疑情况
see if anybody's moving around, just look for suspicious activity.

1258
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,500
我带了支.50口径的反器材步枪
Toted the .50-cal up there with me.

1259
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,430
说不准就会派上用场
You just never know when you might need it.

1260
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:27,800
狙击手史蒂夫・瑞切特
一英里远距狙杀

1261
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:26,800
狙击手史蒂夫・瑞切特 一英里远距狙杀
The sniper Steve Reichert one mile kill shot

1262
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:31,420
瑞切特使用的是巴雷特M82-A3
Reichert's weapon: the Barrett M82-A3

1263
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:35,760
特殊用途狙击步枪  .50口径的大家伙
Special Application Scoped Rifle, a .50-caliber beast.

1264
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:41,180
那是一支.50口径巴雷特M82-A3半自动重狙
The weapon was a .50-caliber semiautomatic Barrett M82-A3.

1265
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:49,630
武器型号:M82-A3特殊用途狙击步枪
口径: 12.7X99mm
枪口初速: 每秒2800英尺
最大有效射程: 2000码

1266
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:45,020
弹匣容量10发  .50枪弹
It holds about ten rounds of .50-caliber ammunition.

1267
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:46,950
配备广角瞄准镜
It has a barrel periscope.

1268
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,430
最大有效射程2,000码
Max effective range, I'd say, is 2,000 yards.

1269
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:53,360
用这种枪和枪弹  车辆都能打残
With that weapon and that round, you could stop a car or a truck.

1270
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,480
瑞切特选用了这支.50口径的重狙
Reichert chooses the .50-cal

1271
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,130
而非他通常使用的M40A3
over his standard M40A3.

1272
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,910
如果我们遇到强风或其它情况
If we had strong winds or anything else,

1273
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:02,970
我需要使用抗风能力好一点的
I wanted something that would actually buck the wind a little bit better,

1274
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:05,980
另外  如果叛军躲在掩体后
and if the insurgents actually took up cover positions,

1275
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,480
不管是在建筑物内或车辆后面
whether inside a building or behind a car,

1276
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,110
我需要它能穿透掩体
I wanted something that could actually punch through the material

1277
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:12,500
消灭敌人
and take them out.

1278
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:18,160
眼前一切都很平静
All is quiet on the ground below

1279
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,580
这时瑞切特的观察手看到路上有个东西
until Reichert's spotter picks up an object on the road.

1280
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,260
塔克下士在路上看到一具动物尸体
Corporal Tucker noticed an animal in the road

1281
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,190
前一天晚上还没有
that wasn't there the night before.

1282
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:30,190
我用瞄准镜拉进看
I got on the scope and zoomed into it,

1283
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:32,730
结果看到了一丝反光
and we saw just a little bit of glint coming off

1284
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:34,130
估计是一截金属线
what we thought was a wire.

1285
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,600
之前有人跟我们说过
They had mentioned to us in the past--

1286
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,950
最近有叛军将路边炸弹安在动物尸体里
the insurgents are starting to emplace IEDs into dead animals,

1287
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:41,690
然后扔在路旁
tossing them on the side of the road.

1288
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,900
瑞切特用步话机通知了下面的陆战队员
Reichert radios the Marines on the ground.

1289
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,610
距前方拐弯20码处可能有路边炸弹
We've got a potential IED in 20 yards around the bend.

1290
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:48,120
-有路边炸弹  -收到
- IED!  - Roger that.

1291
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,420
展开警戒
We're setting up a perimeter.

1292
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:52,840
他们立刻在炸弹四周形成警戒圈
They cordon off the area surrounding the IED.

1293
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,750
各就各位
Get it set!

1294
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,280
封锁这里  快  封锁这里
Cordon it off, let's go, cordon it off!

1295
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:58,010
在发现金属线反光的那一刻
When we actually saw the glint coming off the wires,

1296
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:00,330
我们感觉好极了  总算不负使命
we felt good, like, "Hey, we've done our job."

1297
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:02,970
他们会处理那个路边炸弹的
They would actually get the IED taken care of,

1298
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,720
拆除它就不会有人被炸了
disarm it, nobody gets hurt.

1299
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,360
我们在后面已就位
We're set up at the back side!

1300
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,110
罗伯茨上士  你那边怎样
Staff Sarge Roberts, how you doing?

1301
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:09,190
一切正常
All clear!

1302
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,380
路边炸弹安全
IED is secure.

1303
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:14,980
我们看着他们在炸弹周围展开警戒
We just watched them set up that perimeter around the IED,

1304
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:18,920
然而30秒之后  一切突然爆发
then 30 seconds later, everything erupted.

1305
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,590
先是一枚火箭弹袭击
We got hit with a RPG first,

1306
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,580
紧接着AK步枪就向我们开火了
and then the AKs started coming.

1307
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:32,010
在这么远的距离  我能看到事情的全过程
Being that far away, I could actually see things unfolding--

1308
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:35,550
看到叛军是从哪里冒出来发射火箭筒的
where the insurgents appeared from and launched the RPGs,

1309
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,870
然后就看见机枪打得到处尘土飞扬
and then you just saw dirt and dust kicking up everywhere

1310
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:41,170
陆战队员们正遭受袭击
from machine gun fire the Marines were taking.

1311
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,650
我一看到开始交火
Once I saw the firefight start to erupt,

1312
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,540
就迅速估算了一下距离
I made a quick range estimation,

1313
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,960
调整了瞄具参数
put the correct dope on the scope,

1314
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,740
然后开始搜索狙击目标
and then just started scanning for targets of opportunity.

1315
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,870
叛军在1,350码之外
The insurgents are 1,350 yards away,

1316
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,920
也就是超过3/4英里的距离
a distance of more than three-quarters of a mile.

1317
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:04,930
瑞切特调整了弹着点  将瞄具调至10+2
Reichert adjusts his range--or "Dopes the scope"-- to 10+2:

1318
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:07,980
即1,000码射距  偏2角分
1,000 yards plus two minutes of angle.

1319
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:13,280
下面的海陆队员一路打进城里
The Marines on the ground fight their way into the town

1320
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,990
并以一处废弃的校舍作掩护
and take cover in an abandoned schoolhouse.

1321
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,550
快  火力压制
Come on, come on! Suppressing fire!

1322
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:20,080
敌人的数量远远超过他们
They are greatly outnumbered.

1323
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:24,420
城里的其他叛军听到了交火声
All the other insurgents in the city heard gunfire.

1324
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,770
大概都想去凑凑热闹
We were like, "Yeah, it's party time,"

1325
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:29,070
于是抄起他们的AK步枪  加入战斗
So they grabbed their little AKs and went to the gunfire.

1326
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,250
我们看见一两个家伙在屋顶上出现
We noticed one or two guys pop up on top of the roof,

1327
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,990
我们要开始干活了
and that's when we went to work.

1328
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:37,560
第一个家伙在屋顶上露了头
The first guy, I saw him pop up from the roof,

1329
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,830
我将瞄准镜转向他  打开保险
swung the crosshairs over to him, flipped the weapon on kill,

1330
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,310
将子弹射出
shot the round downrange.

1331
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:48,570
塔克下士立即告诉我  打得太低了
Corporal Tucker immediately advised me, "Hey, you're way low,"

1332
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:51,670
我立刻想到  显然他们已改变了方位
And then it clicked on my head: they've obviously changed positions.

1333
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:53,400
我迅速再次调整了瞄准镜
Made another quick dope change on the scope,

1334
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,650
又打出一发子弹
sent the next round downrange.

1335
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:00,590
这次命中目标
That hit its mark.

1336
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:03,150
只见一片血光飞溅
It was just a pink mist.

1337
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:07,450
即便是在3/4英里之外
Even at three quarters of a mile,

1338
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:09,990
.50枪弹也极具杀伤力
the .50-cal is devastating.

1339
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:13,080
这种武器其实主要是
This actually was mainly designed for

1340
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,530
为装甲运兵车这样的硬目标设计的
armor personnel carrier vehicles-- hard targets--

1341
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:20,350
如果用它来打一个软目标  如人体
so when you hit a soft target --a person--

1342
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,140
一下就打烂了
they just rip apart.

1343
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,950
当那把大枪发射的时候  我心想
When that rifle went off, I thought,

1344
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,140
埃德加・索铎
前海军陆战队员

1345
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:27,050
我靠  后面是什么玩意
"Oh, man, what the hell is that behind me?"

1346
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:30,750
我那时不知道他正在奋力歼敌
I didn't know he was actively engaging targets at the time.

1347
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,370
陆战队员们被敌人的猛烈火力压制住了
The Marines are pinned down, taking heavy fire.

1348
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,720
我们看到三个叛军从后面爬上一个楼梯井
We noticed three insurgents climbing up the back of a stairwell.

1349
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,490
其中一人好像带着一挺RPK
Looked like one of them had an RPK,

1350
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:45,490
目标

1351
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:45,920
一种弹药带供弹的轻机枪  他背在背上
a belt-fed machine gun, slung over his back.

1352
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,600
他们猫在一堵墙后
They ducked down behind a wall.

1353
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:50,770
我立即瞄准他们可能藏身的位置
We immediately put the crosshairs on where I thought they were.

1354
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,750
如果叛军将他们的机枪架好
If the insurgents get their machine gun set up,

1355
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,140
地面上的海军陆战队员就麻烦了
the Marines on the ground are in trouble.

1356
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:00,010
这几个叛军在1,600米开外
The insurgents are more than 1,600 meters away,

1357
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:02,110
整整一英里的距离
a distance of one mile.

1358
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,150
让情况更加复杂的是
Complicating the shot further,

1359
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:08,180
瑞切特必须穿透一堵砖墙击中他们
Reichert must fire through a brick wall to hit them.

1360
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,050
他有完美的高能弹药来做到这一点
He has the perfect ammo for the job:

1361
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,240
劳福斯MK211
穿甲燃烧弹

1362
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,240
.50口径的劳福斯MK211穿甲燃烧弹 
the Raufoss, Mark 211 .50-caliber round.

1363
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,000
当劳福斯穿甲弹击中墙体
When the Raufoss round impacts a concrete wall,

1364
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,520
它会在墙一侧击出一个.50英寸的小洞
it punches a small .50-caliber hole on one side.

1365
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,860
然后黑索金炸药被引爆
Then the RDX explodes.

1366
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:24,340
推动钨合金穿甲弹头穿透墙体
You have the tungsten steel penetrator punching through,

1367
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:26,990
而后锆燃烧剂在墙另一侧爆燃
zirconium sparks on the other side.

1368
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,570
爆炸和弹片效果有如霰弹枪一般
You basically have a shotgun blast and shrapnel

1369
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:32,280
还有个穿墙而过的弹头
and a penetrating dart flying through.

1370
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,990
发射前瑞切特的观察手又作了最后调校
Reichert's spotter gives him last-minute adjustments for the shot.

1371
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,790
这非常关键
It's really crucial to ensure

1372
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:40,750
我们之间的沟通必须准确无误
the communication flowing back and forth are accurate

1373
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:43,260
并对瞄准镜作出相应调整
and you're actually making the changes to the scope.

1374
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:51,310
战术呼吸让瑞切特的瞄准稳定下来
Tactical breathing steadies Reichert's aim.

1375
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,520
他开枪了
He fires.

1376
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,780
这一枪准确击中了我们所希望的位置
The round landed exactly where we wanted it to.

1377
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:05,190
劳福斯穿甲弹以超过2,500英尺每秒的速度
The Raufoss round blasts through the concrete wall

1378
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:08,410
炸穿了坚固的墙体
at a speed in excess of 2,500 feet per second.

1379
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:11,260
爆炸轰碎了叛军
The explosion obliterates the insurgents.

1380
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:15,630
楼梯井对面的墙壁被染成一片血红
The wall on the opposite side of that stairwell just turned red.

1381
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:18,400
再也没有看到他们三个爬起来
We didn't see the... the three of them get up.

1382
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:29,880
其后12小时  瑞切特一直用这支.50大狙射击
Reichert stays on the .50 for the next 12 hours.

1383
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,450
他的精准射击阻滞了叛军的进攻
His sharpshooting halts the insurgents' attack

1384
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,530
挽救了地面海军陆战队员的生命
and saves Marines on the ground.

1385
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40,190
鉴于其英勇行为  他被授予铜星勋章
For his heroic actions, he receives the Bronze Star for Valor.

1386
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:50,190
T1G训练场 
2009年

1387
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:49,190
T1G训练场  2009年
T1G Training Facilities, 2009.

1388
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:53,900
五年后  史蒂夫・瑞切特又拿起了M82A3
Five years later, Steve Reichert is back behind the M82-A3,

1389
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:57,120
他曾用来在一英里距离上消灭叛乱份子的利器
the weapon he used to take out insurgents from a mile away.

1390
01:07:57,450 --> 01:08:00,960
这玩意就像在你脸前四尺爆炸的迷你炮
It's a mini-explosion going off about four feet in front of your face.

1391
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,640
冲击波很大  噪音很高
A large overpressure, a lot of noise.

1392
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,170
成天打这也不是件舒服的事情
It's not a pleasant gun to shoot all day long.

1393
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:09,540
打够三四十发  就不想再打了
30 or 40 rounds, and you want to quit.

1394
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,630
不过还是很好的武器系统
Still a great weapon system.

1395
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,090
2004年的四月
In April 2004,

1396
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:18,090
我的武器系统  M82A3
my weapon system, the M82A3 was

1397
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:22,880
插着塞满了Mk211拉弗斯弹的弹匣
loaded with magzines full of Mk211 Rafuss round and

1398
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:27,950
这个子弹最终就是给坏人们品尝的
the business end of this round were the bad guys are experiencing

1399
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:31,630
同一杆枪  同一种弹  同一个人
Same weapon, same round, same sniper.

1400
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:37,820
瑞切特将使用12.7MM的拉弗斯弹药
Reichert will fire the .50-caliber Raufoss rounds

1401
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:37,820
军方编号MK211的.50BMG高爆穿甲弹药
原是挪威NAMMO公司的拉弗斯AS  故得此名

1402
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,250
打穿九英寸厚的水泥砖墙
into a nine-inch-thick cinderblock wall,

1403
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,740
跟那次一英里绝杀上
the same type of wall insurgents hid behind

1404
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,030
叛乱分子藏身的掩体是一样的
when he made his one-mile kill shot.

1405
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:48,630
一旦弹头命中目标
Once this round impacts the target,

1406
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:52,360
其内部的黑索金就会被引爆  造成一次小爆炸
the RDX will detonate, kind of create a mini-shape charge,

1407
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:52,360
环三亚甲基三硝胺  缩写RDX  优异高爆炸药

1408
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:56,340
所以如有任何易燃液体  汽油或别的什么
so if there are any flammable liquids-- gas, anything of that nature--

1409
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:59,170
立马就会开始着火燃烧或是爆炸
it immediately detonates or catches fire.

1410
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:04,260
开始喽
Going hot.

1411
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:16,790
671格令重的弹头以每秒2850尺的速度击中墙
The 671-grain round hits the wall at 2,850 feet per second.

1412
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,410
弹尖的引燃物
An incendiary mix in the nose of the bullet

1413
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:21,700
会引爆弹头内部的爆炸物
ignites explosives in its core,

1414
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:25,390
推动钨钢弹芯  穿透水泥
launching a tungsten steel penetrator through the concrete.

1415
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,250
这是一块坚实的水泥墙
So, what we have here is a solid filled concrete wall.

1416
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:34,870
看看一次爆炸产生的效应
You can see where the initial blast and explosion took effect.

1417
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:38,060
还能清楚看到这个位置穿甲弹芯
You can actually see where the steel penetrator worked

1418
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:41,550
是如何贯穿这块九英寸的水泥
all the way through a good nine inches of solid concrete

1419
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:43,110
然后继续飞的
and popped out the other end.

1420
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:46,820
为了模拟躲在墙壁后面的叛乱分子
To simulate the insurgents hiding behind the wall,

1421
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:49,400
瑞切特放置了一块终端弹道测试用的凝胶
Reichert adds a block of ballistic gelatin,

1422
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,060
密度和人体组织一样
the same consistency as human tissue.

1423
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,240
那边四月  我看见三个叛乱分子
Back in April, I saw three insurgents

1424
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,470
跑上了一幢房子的后楼梯
coming up the back stairs of a building.

1425
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:58,510
我估计了下他们的可能所在
I picked where I thought they would be,

1426
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:00,840
然后一发打穿墙
sent a round crashing into the wall.

1427
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:06,000
弹头引爆 造成了霰弹效果一样的内侧崩漏杀伤
The round detonated, and you had that shotgun blast

1428
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,610
直对着叛乱分子
coming into where the insurgents were.

1429
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:10,290
凝胶的作用是演示
The gel will give you a good sense of,

1430
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:12,450
如果有人处在这个区域
if there were a person sitting here,

1431
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:15,190
子弹穿透后会把他怎么样
what would happen to him after this round penetrates.

1432
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,170
双重听力保护
Double hearing protection.

1433
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:21,850
这个武器的冲击波很大  所以一定要保护
The overpressure on this weapon system is quite significant, so, uh...

1434
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:23,680
我一边的耳朵已被个路边炸弹震聋了
I'm already deaf in one ear from an IED;

1435
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,380
所以不能再聋了
don't need the other ear gone.

1436
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:30,780
开火
Firing.

1437
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:39,010
拉弗斯弹头横贯水泥墙直接进了凝胶
The Raufoss round blasts to the wall and into the ballistic gelatin.

1438
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:48,730
有好东西看了
This should be interesting.

1439
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,310
以前还真没做过这样正儿八经的实验
Never done an actual test like this before.

1440
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:54,510
也没看过慢动作
Never actually seen it in slow motion.

1441
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:59,770
显而易见  MK211弹轻松穿过了第一层
Obviously, the Mark 211 round penetrated that first block, no problem.

1442
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:04,440
爆炸在接触外墙层时发生
The explosion started to happen on the first panel of the block,

1443
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:08,620
完全炸开了内墙层  而凝胶块
blew out the second panel of the blk, and then the gelatin block itself,

1444
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:12,140
则吸收了大部分的碎片
caught the majority of the fragmentation.

1445
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,220
杀伤空腔很大
The wound cavity is massive.

1446
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:18,720
然后是被甲的大部分
And then, the majority of the jacket--

1447
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,760
至于钨钢穿甲芯
the actual tungsten steel penetrator--

1448
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:26,780
则毫无疑问地穿了出去
actually penetrated out the back end-- no surprise there--

1449
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:30,290
打穿了这里这块水泥砖  继续飞
and then punched through this concrete block, and then continued on.

1450
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:32,480
如果这里后面是个人
If there were a person back here,

1451
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,130
会变成一个碎成很多块的人
they would be in many pieces right now.

1452
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:40,230
弹道专家费尔南多・奎罗分析了损伤
Ballistics Expert Fernando Coelho analyzes the damage.

1453
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,070
刀刃进去三英寸左右
Blade is going about three inches now,

1454
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:43,980
就已经到空腔了
and it's already in the cavity.

1455
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:47,890
奎罗已与不同政府机构合作20年
Coelho worked with numerous government agencies for 20 years.

1456
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,870
水泥碎屑
There is actual cement material throughout the...

1457
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:54,320
遍布了整个伤道
the wound path.

1458
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:58,050
费尔南多・奎罗
EOTAC战术服装公司/弹道学家

1459
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:57,540
很严重
This is just devastating.

1460
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:02,660
如果是三个人排排坐
'Cause you could have had three people back-to-back,

1461
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:06,680
这一发就是串个糖葫芦
and this round would have most likely gone through all three.

1462
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:14,180
一英里  一堵墙  三个叛乱分子
One mile, one brick wall, three insurgents

1463
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:15,710
搞定
gone.

1464
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:18,450
我知道下面平地上有14个弟兄
I just knew I had 14 guys on the deck down there,

1465
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:20,050
他们正受到袭击
and they were receiving fire.

1466
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:23,900
距离不算优势  直到那晚才算
The distance didn't really click till, you know, that night.

1467
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:25,690
此时此地  此枪此弹
Even at that distance, with that round,

1468
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:27,180
唯有做到弹无虚发
as long as your rounds find their marks,

1469
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:30,400
你才能在战场上扭转乾坤
you can definitely change the dynamics on the battlefield.

1470
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:32,850
此长  彼消
Good for us, bad for them.

1471
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,350
阿富汗的崇山峻岭间
High in the mountains of Afghanistan,

1472
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:45,540
一位加拿大狙击手会超越瑞切特的一英里击杀
a Canadian sniper will eclipse Reichert's one-mile kill shot,

1473
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:49,210
在一英里半距离上干掉一名塔利班分子
taking out a Taliban fighter one and a half miles away.

1474
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:54,190
不知道他们是不是以为自己能侥幸逃生
I don't know if they just thought that today was their lucky day, but

1475
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:55,770
但完全不是
it wasn't.

1476
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:04,510
最远的一击

1477
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:08,960
麦克米兰战术50长程狙击步枪
The McMillan Tac-50 Long Range Sniper Rifle.

1478
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,790
.50弹的枪口初速在2700fps左右
A .50-caliber round leaves the muzzle at 2,700 feet per second.

1479
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,020
威力与精度的结晶
A combination of power and accuracy,

1480
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:21,550
战术50能在20个橄榄球场距离废掉一辆车
the Tac-50 is capable of taking out a vehicle 20 football fields away.

1481
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:26,480
我头一次打战术50的时候实在吃惊不小
The very first time I fired the Tac-50 was an awakening

1482
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,060
才知道原来世间有这么强力的武器
to know that there's something out there with that much power.

1483
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:33,850
该怎么形容好呢
How would I describe it?

1484
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:37,450
就是敌人的梦魇吧
Probably an enemy's worst nightmare.

1485
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:40,630
狙击手  罗伯・弗隆
The sniper: Rob Furlong.

1486
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:44,290
狙击手
罗伯・弗隆
史上最远狙杀
一英里半

1487
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:44,290
史上最远狙杀  一英里半
Longest kill shot in history.One and a half miles.

1488
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:44,290
此记录已在被英国羽林骑马兵下士柯栾格・哈里森打破
2009年11月  用L115A3射杀距离2475M  首发命中

1489
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:46,520
阿富汗

1490
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:47,330
2002年三月
March, 2002.

1491
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,610
夏伊科峡谷
纬度:33.446769  经度:68.198038

1492
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:50,500
美军发动了森蚺/林蟒行动
U.S. Forces launch Operation Anaconda.

1493
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,790
任务是歼灭夏伊科峡谷区域的
The mission: Destroy Al-qaeda and Taliban forces

1494
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,940
基地组织和塔利班武装
in the Shah-I-Kot Valley.

1495
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,720
这个区域崎岖难走
The terrain is rugged and unforgiving.

1496
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,030
漫山遍野都是敌人
The mountains filled with enemy fighters.

1497
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:09,140
弗隆是加拿大狙击队的一员
Furlong is part of a Canadian sniper team

1498
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:11,570
跟随美国特种部队行动
attached to U.S. Special Forces.

1499
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:14,820
进到人家门口打仗总归是有点怕怕的
It's pretty humbling coming into somebody's home turf.

1500
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,760
开进峡谷的那天  我差点吓坏了
Pushing into that valley that day, I'm almost in awe.

1501
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:23,910
就像跑进了个鱼缸  看得见那些塔利班战士
Moving into a fishbowl and we could see all these Taliban fighters,

1502
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:25,070
平均海拔  9000英尺

1503
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:25,470
他们就在高地上
they're up on the higher ground.

1504
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:28,790
对于这个海拔高度的作业  我完全没有经验
I had no experience in operating in those kind of altitudes

1505
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:34,900
弗隆的武器  麦克米兰战术50
Furlong's weapon: The McMillan Tac-50.

1506
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:40,800
武器型号:麦克米兰战术50
口径: 12.7X99mm
枪口初速: 每秒2700英尺
最大有效射程: 2190码

1507
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:39,300
一款最大有效射程2190码的狙击步枪
A sniper rifle with a max effective range of 2,190 yards.

1508
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:44,710
最初的目标是在1500米距离上的
The very first target we engaged was 1,500 meters.

1509
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:47,320
这是森蚺行动中我们挑的
That was the closest target we would engage

1510
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,110
距离最近的一个
during Operation Anaconda.

1511
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,130
希望尽可能接近目标
We want to be close enough to the target

1512
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:53,920
以尽量保证一枪毙命
that we can guarantee one shot, one kill.

1513
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,600
只是在1500米距离上打人体靶
When you're shooting at a human-sized target at 1,500 meters,

1514
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,820
变数实在太多
there's so many variables to take into place.

1515
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,670
弗隆所处有海拔一万英尺高
Furlong works at elevations as high as 10,000 feet.

1516
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:07,730
高海拔对于远距离射击有很大影响
The extreme altitude has a dramatic effect on long-range shots.

1517
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,980
海拔每上升一千码  情况就完全不同
Every thousand feet you go up, it's a whole new set of equations.

1518
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:11,280
军士长  马克・斯宾塞
英国陆军[已退役]

1519
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:16,820
因为空气越来越稀薄  故而
Because the air's getting thinner, so therefore,

1520
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,980
海拔
5000尺

1521
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:20,280
枪口初速会让子弹打得更远
your muzzle velocities are increasing your time of flight.

1522
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,490
海拔
8500尺

1523
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:23,390
低海拔反而没有那么远
It's actually shorter from the distance further down.

1524
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:24,900
海拔
10000尺

1525
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:29,890
风偏对于我们的击杀率有很大影响
Winds played a huge factor what our, uh, hit ratio.

1526
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,070
一击必杀的例子不是很多
Not a lot of one-round hits.

1527
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:34,660
原因在于我们有时候会面对  比如
Reason being is we're dealing with, at times,

1528
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,960
有时会面对最少三次横风
I remember at least three crosswinds and you just,

1529
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,990
那就只能等最佳时机
you wait for that perfect moment.

1530
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:42,010
要是我说没风就没风  那就好办了
It's great if I can get the winds to die out.

1531
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,220
实际上怎么可能会没风
But how many times does three crosswinds die out?

1532
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:46,460
根本不可能
They don't.

1533
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:53,520
我们效率是如此之高
We were so effective.

1534
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:58,000
很快就切断了他们所有的补给线
We had shut down all resupply lines

1535
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,160
那些想要补给的 
and the guys who would try to use them

1536
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:04,460
就只贴着地慢慢爬
would actually get down on their faces and crawl.

1537
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,110
不到一周
Within a week,

1538
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:09,990
弗隆就打光了加拿大产的弹药
furlong runs out of his Canadian-made ammo.

1539
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:14,850
有人给了我们些美国产的弹药
We had somebody offer us, uh, American-made ammunition

1540
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:17,990
我们开始用的时候发现 这种子弹更热
and when we started using it we noticed that it was a hotter round.

1541
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:29,230
美国产0.50（英寸）口径子弹
加拿大产0.50（英寸）口径子弹

1542
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:21,640
我们用这个子弹能够打得更远
We were getting a lot longer distances out of this round.

1543
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:25,170
至于是不是因为弹头更轻
Whether that round was a lighter round,

1544
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:29,380
还是发射药燃烧得更快  我不清楚
whether it was a faster burning propellant, I don't know.

1545
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,410
每一枪都是全新的一枪
Every shot that we made was new for us.

1546
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:39,090
美国产0.50（英寸）口径子弹
加拿大产0.50（英寸）口径子弹

1547
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:35,450
不管是因美国弹药更符合空气动力学
Whether the U.S. rounds are more aerodynamic

1548
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:37,930
还是只是烧药更加速燃
or simply have a faster burning propellant,

1549
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,010
结果都很惊人
the results are dramatic.

1550
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:44,260
弗隆及其团队在超过一英里距离上都能命中
Furlong and his team take out enemy targets more than a mile away.

1551
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:46,990
但他创纪录的那一枪尚未到来
But his longest shot is yet to come.

1552
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,920
夏伊科谷地
The Shah-I-Kot Valley.

1553
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:52,480
平均海拔  9000英尺
Mean altitude: 9,000 Feet.

1554
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:52,480
射杀背景
夏伊科谷地
平均海拔  9000英尺

1555
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,520
我们观察到有人步行穿越河谷
When somebody's walking on a river valley floor,

1556
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,550
我当时在海拔8500尺处
I'm up at 8,500 feet.

1557
01:16:58,550 --> 01:16:59,390
正往下看
I'm looking down.

1558
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:01,880
简直像是站在云端俯视众生
It's almost like being on the clouds looking at someone.

1559
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:08,550
我们观察到了一个塔利班的三人队
We had observed a three-man Taliban team and

1560
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:13,390
其中一个扛着RPK  7.62mm口径机枪
one of them had an RPK, which is a 7.62 machine gun on his shoulder,

1561
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:12,390
目标

1562
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:13,390
RPK是基于AKM设计衍生的一种班组轻机枪

1563
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:16,990
我们决定解决那个
and it was decided that we would engage the Taliban fighter

1564
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:19,470
扛RPK的塔利班份子
with the RPK on his shoulder.

1565
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:23,870
我的搭档观测了目标  报给了我距离
My partner liaises the target, gives me the distance.

1566
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:26,410
然后报给我风向变化
He starts to give me varying wind direction.

1567
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:29,780
按密位制校准好我的瞄准镜
Its everything on milsm to enter in data into my scope

1568
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:33,280
或者说是这种情况下  我得怎么打
or, in this case, what I'm gonna do to

1569
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,510
才够得着这个距离
be able to reach that range

1570
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:38,900
这可是一英里半的距离
You're talking about a mile and a half's distance

1571
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:43,840
而他们在找对面山上的一个人型靶
and they're looking for a man-sized target on the side of a mountain.

1572
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,250
实际上  这很不简单
Now, that in itself is quite a feat,

1573
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,660
首先要定位那个人就不容易
to actually find that guy in the first place.

1574
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,310
弗隆在想尽办法增加他的射程
Furlong looks for any way to get more distance on his shot.

1575
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,990
他用回了一个老招
He resorts to an old sniper trick.

1576
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:56,750
那天很暖和
It was a very warm day.

1577
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:59,990
我就把弹药都铺开放在太阳底下晒
We had our ammo laid out in the sun--

1578
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:01,710
一切为了射程
anything to increase range.

1579
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:03,380
不会有很大的改观
It's not gonna make a huge difference,

1580
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:07,540
但会对发射药的燃速有些许帮助
but it'll make a little difference for how propellant acts.

1581
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:11,910
更快燃烧意味着能飞得更远
A faster burn allowing the round to travel slightly further.

1582
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:14,910
鉴于角度和距离的局限
Because of the extreme angle and the distance,

1583
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:17,000
弗隆用了伏击方式
Furlong uses the ambush method--

1584
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:20,450
距离目标：2430米
海拔：8500英尺

1585
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,850
在目标的行进路线上等候
leading the target or allowing it to walk into the path of the bullet.

1586
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,720
我旋钮都转到最大
I max out my elevation drum.

1587
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,400
最终射击位置
1.5英里外

1588
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:30,790
风偏是最大值  等于我割除了瞄准镜半边
My windage is maxed out, so I'm halfing out my scope,

1589
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:34,300
我的意思是说  我在用密位点给提前量
and what I mean by that is, I'm leading with my mil-dots,

1590
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:38,090
但同时我也在用密位补偿仰角
but I'm also using my mil-dots for elevation, as well.

1591
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:40,280
类似对割我的瞄准镜
So, I'm kind of halfing my scope

1592
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,170
来找这个瞄准点
to where I believe my point of aim is.

1593
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:45,920
比方说一个瞄准镜
When you have a scope, uh,

1594
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,610
通常人都会对着这个点瞄准
usually this is what everybody's thinking about for a point of aim.

1595
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,580
但如果我在留提前量
If I'm leading a target, uh,

1596
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:54,440
目标从右往左走
and I have a target walking from right to left,

1597
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:59,180
他在动  我却不动  在这个点等他
he's walking and I'm waiting for him to hit this point right here.

1598
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:02,640
一旦目标到了这个密位点
Once that target is at my point of aim,

1599
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,240
就是开枪时刻
that's when the shot's released.

1600
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,710
标准伏击
That's an ambush.

1601
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,620
不是准心压着目标开火
Not releasing on the crosshairs.

1602
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:11,010
这个情况下  是一个密位的提前量
You release this is what you're using

1603
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:13,410
作为瞄准点  再开火
for a point of aim and that's one mil.

1604
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,360
大体上一个四密位的提前量
Basically with a four mil lead,

1605
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,220
和四密位的高度调整
and a four mil for elevation,

1606
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:24,400
瞄准点大概就在这里
your point of aim roughly would be in this area.

1607
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,070
弗隆瞄高了四个密位  实际大约15尺
Furlong aims 4 mils, or roughly 15 feet above,

1608
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:33,030
瞄左四个密位  大约也是15尺
and approximately 4 mils or 15 feet to the left of his target.

1609
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:37,560
这些提前量能补偿弹头下降  风偏和偏转造成的误差
These holds compensate for bullet drop, wind and spin drift.

1610
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,910
弗隆保持稳定  瞄准
furlong steadys himself, takes aim

1611
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,830
瞄准  开火
takes aim, and fires

1612
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,820
我的搭档告诉我  没打中
And from my partner, it's miss.

1613
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:57,200
三发未中
Off three.

1614
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:57,970
右边有四
Right four.

1615
01:19:57,970 --> 01:20:00,830
不管是什么样的理由  跟塔利班交锋时候
For whatever reason, when dealing with the Taliban,

1616
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:02,490
他们总是不怕死一样
they didn't show a lot of fear.

1617
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,440
有时候对着他们开上好几枪
You would shoot at them sometimes and,

1618
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,080
他们动都不动
uh, they wouldn't even move.

1619
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,150
他们也知道自己在被人打
And they knew they were being shot at.

1620
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:12,110
子弹会在脚边溅起尘土或命中他们身边物件
Like the splash would hit by their feet or an object next to them.

1621
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,430
我不知道他们是不是以为
I don't know if they just thought that

1622
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:16,780
自己能侥幸逃生
today was their lucky day but,

1623
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:19,010
但完全不是
it wasn't.

1624
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:22,830
弗隆的观察手跟踪第一发子弹的
Furlong's spotter follows the vapor trail

1625
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:24,500
子弹漩涡

1626
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:28,500
尾迹

1627
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:25,370
尾迹或叫子弹漩涡
or swirl of the bullet on his first shot,

1628
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:28,480
然后观察到当击中地面后弹头造成的
then observes the splash or dirt kicked up by the round

1629
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,060
尘土四溅
as it hits the ground.

1630
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,450
为了量化  你可以想象
To quantify that, if you could imagine

1631
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:35,820
观察手看到点50子弹
the observer watched a .50-caliber bullet

1632
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:39,270
如何飞过一英里半扎进泥里
at a mile and a half away impact the ground,

1633
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:42,650
然后根据弹着点通知我如何修正
and then he called adjustments from where the bullet landed

1634
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:46,030
才能在下一发确保打中敌人
to where he knew the bullet had to be to hit the enemy.

1635
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,810
弗隆准备他的第二发
Furlong sets up for his second shot.

1636
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,570
他们分了三路
They go three different directions--

1637
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:56,230
相隔都不远  离散开的地方约20至30英尺
not too far-- roughly 20 to 30 feet, to where they scatter.

1638
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:57,490
但我能看到他
but I can see him

1639
01:20:57,490 --> 01:20:59,610
弗隆打了第二发
Furlong fires his second shot.

1640
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:08,170
打偏了  命中了一个塔利班士兵的背包
He misses, hitting the Taliban soldier's backpack.

1641
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:10,990
刚好是在第二个和第三个人中间
Well, between the second and third,

1642
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:12,290
没有修正必要
there was no correction needed.

1643
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:14,130
我知道接下来会发生什么
I knew exactly what had to happen

1644
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:16,800
可我还是要打出这第三发
and I wanted to get that third shot downrange.

1645
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,850
弗隆和他目标之间隔了一英里半
One and a half miles separate Furlong and his target.

1646
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:24,430
开火
He fires.

1647
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:30,490
弗隆的子弹以2700fps的速度离膛
Furlong's round leaves the rifle at 2,700 feet per second.

1648
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,420
外弹道

1649
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:32,960
飞行时间  四秒
Time of flight: Four seconds.

1650
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:40,670
终结目标
Target eliminated.

1651
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:43,040
我知道他倒下了  不过也就这样了 
I know he went down but that's about it.

1652
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,400
如果点50打到你
If a .50-cal round hit you,

1653
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,040
就都不用想以后的事了
you're not gonna live to tell about it.

1654
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,470
此弹必杀
It's a devastating round.

1655
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:51,910
这是一颗能打穿你身体
You're talking about a projectile going through you

1656
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:55,380
留下个比拇指还大的洞那样的弹头
that's roughly a little bit larger than your thumb.

1657
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,540
罗伯・弗隆一英里半的射杀
Rob Furlong's mile and a half kill shot

1658
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:03,470
卡洛斯・哈斯库克是用加了瞄准镜的M2重机枪打的
距离2500码  本片此前并未提及

1659
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:03,470
超越卡洛斯・哈斯库克之前的记录157码
shatters Carlos Hathcock's previous record by 157 yards

1660
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:06,170
我知道卡洛斯・哈斯库克是谁
I knew who Carlos Hathcock was,

1661
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:08,230
但我不知道那次是多少距离
but didn't know what the distance was.

1662
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:10,620
不知道是不是对我冲击很大
I don't know if it really has hit me.

1663
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:14,210
我只是当它是我的本职工作
I always just took it as, uh, I was just doing my job.

1664
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,870
指该片制作时间  此记录已被打破

1665
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,870
罗伯・弗隆的记录至今仍是第一
Rob Furlong's record still stands today,

1666
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:29,020
而在亚利桑那的高山之间
but high in the mountains of Arizona,

1667
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:33,840
一位前海豹队员在尝试再现弗隆的一英里半狙杀
an ex-Navy Seal tries to duplicate his shot from a mile and a half away.

1668
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:47,650
弹道是一门科学  是针对不同的武器
Ballistics is a science... of the certain weapon,

1669
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:50,550
不同的口径  不同子弹的
and the certain caliber, the certain bullet.

1670
01:22:50,690 --> 01:22:55,250
怎样用一枚做成流线型的金属块
How you can take a small piece of steel that's formed in a cone

1671
01:22:55,250 --> 01:23:00,160
从一个金属管子里以极高速度飞出去
and shoot it down another tube of steel at a high rate of speed

1672
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:04,690
然后准确地不断命中红心
and then be accurate enough to repeat that over and over and over again.

1673
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:09,270
在狙击手扣下扳机打出那一发子弹前
Before that sniper pulls the trigger and delivers that shot

1674
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:11,870
他必须要看透大自然
he must outguess Mother Nature.

1675
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:14,170
外弹道

1676
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:15,170
外弹道是子弹抗争于大自然的艺术
External ballistics is the art of that bullet handling Mother Nature.

1677
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:22,120
一般而言  海拔越高  弹速越快
You might see a faster bullet at different elevations.

1678
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:21,150
海拔
5000尺

1679
01:23:21,150 --> 01:23:24,580
海拔
8500尺

1680
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,870
再加上摩擦力重力还有别的要素参与
With drag and gravity and other things that come into play

1681
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:26,650
海拔
10000尺

1682
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:27,860
会让子弹落点不同
will help the bullet hit differently.

1683
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:30,980
子弹本身的飞行轨迹  明确飞行时间
The bullet's flight path itself, understanding time of flight,

1684
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:33,760
明确子弹  步枪分别的温度  
understanding heat on both

1685
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,870
还有大气温度和横风
the bullet, the rifle, the wind--

1686
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,970
都是狙击手必须调整的
snipers must be attuned to that.

1687
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:48,900
夏伊科峡谷
阿富汗  2002年

1688
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:48,440
森蚺行动  2002年3月
Operation Anaconda. March, 2002.

1689
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:52,990
狙击手们会遇到的最为极端的弹道环境之一
One of the most extreme ballistic environments a sniper will ever face.

1690
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,590
加拿大狙击手罗伯・弗隆对抗着高原反应
Canadian sniper Rob Furlong battles dizzying altitudes,

1691
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,220
变幻不定的横风  和那险恶的山岭
shifting crosswinds and treacherous mountains.

1692
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:06,200
他从一英里半距离干掉了一名塔利班机枪手
He takes out a Taliban machine gunner from a mile and a half away.

1693
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:10,350
史上最长距离狙杀
The longest kill shot in history.

1694
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,880
我曾开玩笑说
I've joked about it, and maybe

1695
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:17,190
如果我再花一个月去再现这次射击
if I spend the next month trying to replicate it--

1696
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:19,410
罗伯特・弗隆下士
加拿大陆军[已退役]

1697
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:19,170
我还不知道我能不能再做到
I don't know, could I do it again?

1698
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:21,180
我倒是希望我能
I would like to think I can. I mean,

1699
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,850
是不是那天天地星辰都眷顾我来着
were all the stars and moons aligned that day?

1700
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:25,020
我是真不知道
I don't know

1701
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:30,600
麦克米兰训练中心  北靶场
McMillan Training Facility-- North Range.

1702
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:32,180
麦克米兰训练中心  北靶场

1703
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:32,180
亚利桑那西北
Northwest Arizona.

1704
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,720
赖安・麦克米兰  退役海豹队员  正尝试再现
Ryan McMillan, ex-Navy SEAL, will try to replicate

1705
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:39,370
罗伯・弗隆的一英里半狙杀  用的也是同一种武器
Rob Furlong's mile-and-a-half kill shot using the same weapon:

1706
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:42,240
麦克米兰战术50远距狙击步枪
a McMillan Tac-50 Long Range Sniper Rifle.

1707
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:46,320
这样的射击是人所能想到的最困难的一种
This shot is really one of the most difficult shots you can ever imagine.

1708
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,520
不仅仅是那2430米的距离
Not only the distance at 2,430 meters,

1709
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,180
还有横风  环境因素
but also the wind, the environmental factors,

1710
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:53,880
所有都参杂进来使这种射击难度极高
everything that goes into it that makes it a very difficult shot.

1711
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:53,830
赖安・麦克米兰
麦克米兰国际集团的副总裁  前海豹队员

1712
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,230
马克・斯宾塞  前英国陆军狙击手
Mark Spicer, former British Army Sniper and

1713
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,930
麦克米兰国际集团训练部的主管
Director of Training for McMillan Group International,

1714
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:02,340
开车出去准备射击的标靶
drives out to set up the target for the shot.

1715
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:05,300
所能看见的  是我们已经走了
You can see now, because we've been going

1716
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:08,000
军士长  马克・斯宾塞
英国陆军[已退役]

1717
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:08,530
这么远的路了  终于距离一样了
such a distance already, just how far away this target is.

1718
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:14,690
我们用的是白色的人形靶纸
What we've got is a white paper human representative target

1719
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:18,600
画着恐怖分子拿的典型AK特征步枪
of a terrorist armed with the sort archetypical AK-47

1720
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,360
代表广泛存在的恐怖主义
associated with terrorism in general.

1721
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,990
在上面插了面提高能见度的红旗
What we attached was the high visibility flag to the top of the mass.

1722
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,160
旗子的作用是给出恐怖分子靶所在处的
Now, what that flag will do is that will give me an indication of

1723
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:33,460
风向的具体情况
exactly what the wind is doin the target end.

1724
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,780
目标在2400米距离上了
Okay, this target itself is at 2,400 meters.

1725
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:39,460
如果你现在抬头看看周围山顶
If you now look around up to the top of the hillside

1726
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:41,930
能看见一辆白车停在山脊上
you can see the white vehicle that's on the ridgeline.

1727
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,400
那就是我们的开火位置
That's going to be what the  firing point is.

1728
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:47,590
往那方向看  能看见一条干的河床
If you look straight out here you can see a wash

1729
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:49,680
一直通到山脚下
that runs up into the base of the mountains here.

1730
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,310
顺着河床再在往上看
If you follow that wash all the way up,

1731
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:53,250
右边有个树丛
there's a patch of trees on the right.

1732
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,290
树丛再左边一点就是我们的目标了
Just to the left of that patch of trees is our target.

1733
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:58,000
这样你就能体会那具体有多远了
As you can see how far away that is and

1734
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,400
这么一枪会有多难
how difficult of a shot that must've been to make.

1735
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:06,150
海拔  1997英尺

1736
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,400
山区地形类似阿富汗
The mountainous terrain is similar to Afghanistan,

1737
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,970
但是海拔却低了接近7000尺
but the elevation is almost 7,000 feet lower.

1738
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:11,400
更大空气密度意味赖安的子弹会飞得更慢更近
heavier air means Ryan's hot won't carry as fast or as far

1739
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:15,380
我命中概率看来非常小
My chances of making this shot are pretty slim.

1740
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:17,370
但不管怎样我们都要试它一试
But we're going to give it a shot anyway.

1741
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:22,720
我先上来射击用的是  M33普通弹
I'm going to first shoot with this, uh, ball M33 ammo.

1742
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:26,760
我现在要做的是子弹上靶
What I'm going to do here is just get on target with this.

1743
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:30,090
你要我先打上河床看看么  马克
You want me to at the wash first, Mark?

1744
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:31,630
这样我们能看见点尘土
So we can see some splash?

1745
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:33,280
就往目标右边一点
Just to the right of the target.

1746
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:36,220
赖安瞄准了目标右边一点的沙地
Ryan aims at a sandy spot near the target.

1747
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,780
命中沙土能给观察手提供可见的弹着
Hitting the sand creates a visible "Splash" for his spotter.

1748
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:43,190
马克就能在此弹着的基础上给出修正
Mark can then give him corrections based on that impact

1749
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:46,650
并帮助他命中一英里半上的目标
and get him onto the target a mile-and-a-half downrange.

1750
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:49,530
观察手就位
Spotter on.

1751
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:50,440
射手待发
Shooter ready.

1752
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:51,760
开火
Send it.

1753
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,190
没有

1754
01:26:58,770 --> 01:27:02,660
赖安的子弹命中了目标周围的植被区
Ryan's shot impacts somewhere in the vegetation surrounding the target.

1755
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:04,500
没有可见弹着标识
There is no visible splash.

1756
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:08,770
我觉得吧 我们往下移

1757
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:11,840
靠左往河床那个方向

1758
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,280
那就是目标的七点钟方向了

1759
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,260
-是目标七点钟方向  -好

1760
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:18,560
因为那样比较直接

1761
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,920
不如说是我们进去的那条路

1762
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:24,160
试试能否在那弄点动静出来

1763
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,620
没有

1764
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:35,120
目标周围茂密的植被
The dense vegetation around the target

1765
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,330
使得观察弹着的痕迹非常困难
makes it difficult to detect any sign of the round's impact.

1766
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:40,830
赖安对准了一堆土
Ryan takes aim at a patch of dirt.

1767
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,130
观察手就位

1768
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:44,380
射手待发

1769
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:45,490
开火

1770
01:27:49,150 --> 01:27:50,270
还是没有

1771
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:52,530
你打进那堆叶子里面去了

1772
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:56,190
到底是高了还是低了
You have any idea if it's high or low?

1773
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:58,250
完全不知道  什么都看不见

1774
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:59,940
没有尾流或别的什么

1775
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,800
这样就能对这种射击的难度有直观体会了

1776
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,850
马克在找尾流  弹头后面的白色蒸汽轨迹
Mark is looking for "Swirl," The vapor trail of the bullet,

1777
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:09,880
产生于弹头推开前方空气运动时
created as it displaces the air in its path.

1778
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,360
观察手利用尾流来追踪子弹的飞行轨迹
Spotters use swirl to pick up the flight path of the bullet.

1779
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,630
风变大了
The wind kicks up,

1780
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:19,190
在靶场上达到15到20英里每小时
blowing gusts of 15 to 20 miles per hour across the range.

1781
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:21,850
环境使他们最终不可能
Conditions make it virtually impossible

1782
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:24,030
捕捉到子弹的尾迹
to detect the bullet's vapor trail.

1783
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,920
没有

1784
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:36,430
完全没有
Not a thing.

1785
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:38,390
我也什么都没看到
I didn't see a damn, thing either.

1786
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,640
这天  赖安・麦克米兰
On this day, Ryan McMillan,

1787
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:44,810
前海豹并专业射手  没法看透大自然
ex-Navy Seal and expert marksman, can't outguess Mother Nature.

1788
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,670
这样的地形
With the terrain here, um,

1789
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:49,300
非常接近阿富汗
it's very similar to what you would see in Afghanistan.

1790
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:50,950
那里有不同向的风
They have different directions of wind.

1791
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:52,660
当我看目标时
And as I look at the target--

1792
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:55,440
目标上的旗子现在  是忽左忽右的
flags on the target right now, they're going from left to right.

1793
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:59,560
实际上我们能看见的不同区域里
So every different place that we can actually see the wind

1794
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,420
风向都是不一样的
is going in a different direction.

1795
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:03,740
射手前面风向是从右到左
From right to left here at the-- at the, uh, shooter.

1796
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:05,510
第一个弹着附近是从右到左
Also right to left at the first spot

1797
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:07,210
到了峡谷又变成从左到右了
and left to right back in the valley.

1798
01:29:07,210 --> 01:29:10,730
不过对子弹影响最大的地方还是在枪口
And the place that affects your bullet the most is right at muzzle.

1799
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:12,880
所以如果有风这样来
So if you have a wind going one way,

1800
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,990
目标

1801
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,880
比如说在枪口处从右往左
from let's say right to left at the muzzle,

1802
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,590
会导致你的弹头一直往左偏
it's going to push your bullet longer down its path

1803
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:19,640
并且一直影响
and it's going to affect it more.

1804
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,990
目标

1805
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,320
等该命中目标时  你就不知道它飞哪去了
And then by the time it gets to the target you just never know.

1806
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:23,760
很难的一枪
It's a very difficult shot.

1807
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:25,140
你要来试试吗
You want to take a shot at it?

1808
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:26,200
不了
No.

1809
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:36,440
从罗伯・弗隆的破纪录射击
From Rob Furlong's record-breaking shot

1810
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:39,580
到伊森・普雷斯的费卢杰屋顶神射
to Ethan Place's sharpshooting on a Fallujah rooftop,

1811
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:43,560
总有个地方  总有那么一颗弹头飞速掠过
somewhere, a lone bullet hurtles through space

1812
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,320
与那全然不知的目标相遇
on a collision course with an unwitting target.

1813
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:50,350
射击的另一端是一名狙击手
On the other end of that shot is a sniper,

1814
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:53,550
具备大师级的弹道知识和神射技巧
posessing a mastery of bullistic, marksmanship

1815
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:58,630
及最重要的  一枪毙命的觉悟
most importantly,the mindset of one shot, one kill

1816
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:00,040
要明白你是个猎杀人的猎手
Understand that you are a hunter of man

1817
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,640
这是你的职业  然后全神贯注于十字线
and this is what you do and then focus on the reticle.

1818
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,880
就能帮你顺利过关
That'll get you through.

1819
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:06,650
要找到有这样觉悟  这样纪律性的
It's hard to find somebody who has a mindset to

1820
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:09,030
这样全心投入的人  非常之难  
be that disciplined, be that dedicated to something.

1821
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:11,620
而要找到能够让神准技术
And it's extreme to find that person,

1822
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:14,690
上到全新境界的人  更是难上加难
who he define marksmanship to another level

1823
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:18,610
狙击手是战场上最致命的武器
A sniper is the most deadly weapon on the battlefield.

1824
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,900
因为他有耐心  有技术
'Cause he's got patience, he's got the skill set,

1825
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,170
且能掩藏  融入环境  并骗过你的眼睛
and he can hide, blend and deceive.

1826
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:26,090
你根本逃不过狙击手的猎杀
There's no place you can hide from a sniper.

1827
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,340
一旦狙击手锁定目标  你必死无疑
If the sniper wants you, he's going to get you.
