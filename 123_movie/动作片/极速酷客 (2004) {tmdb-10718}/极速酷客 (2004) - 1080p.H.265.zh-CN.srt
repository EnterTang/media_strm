1
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,390
你飚得好快哦
Fast bike, huh?

2
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,770
是啊 还可以
Yeah, sometimes.

3
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,040
要加油吗？
Want me to fill it up?

4
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,840
我不是来加油的
I'm not here for the gas.

5
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,610
帮我看好我的车
You can keep an eye on it for me.

6
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,310
要算帐就到路上算
Leave it on the road, guys.

7
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,320
机车小子 你差点害我撞车
That stunt almost cost me my ride, boy.

8
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,880
- 我在赶时间 你挡了我的路 - 你赶着去投胎吧
- You were in my way. I was in a hurry. - Well, now you'll be late.

9
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,350
你的脏手别碰我的车
Hey! Get your dirty little punk ass off my car.

10
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,590
开车的人怎么都这么嚣张？
What is it about driving cars that makes you all such assholes?

11
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,890
你擦不擦车窗？
Can you do something about these dirty windows?

12
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,390
五块钱
Five bucks.

13
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,030
收十块钱吧
Make it 10.

14
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,300
谢啦
Thanks.

15
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,430
系好安全带
Buckle up.

16
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,590
你没两下就惹上麻烦了
Well. It didn't take long for you to find trouble.

17
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,360
尽管来 我免费招待你吃拳头
Step up. I'm running a two-for-one special today.

18
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,490
吃拳头？
Special, huh?

19
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,040
有送薯条吗？我饿扁了
Can I get fries with that? Because I'm hungry as hell.

20
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,030
- 福特 近来可好？- 见到你真好
- What's up, Ford? How you doing, boy? - Good to see you, man.

21
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,330
- 我也一样 - 欢迎回来
- Wish I could say the same for you. - Welcome home.

22
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,510
谢了 兄弟 威 道尔顿 你们又迟到了
Thanks, man. Val, Dalton. Late as usual.

23
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,890
这小子一声不响跑去泰国半年 还敢嫌我们
Dude's gone six months in Thailand without a word and now he's busting our chops.

24
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,250
你们怎么变得这么难伺候？
Since when did you get so sensitive?

25
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,010
我得赶去参加机车大会
I got a rally to get to.

26
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,050
你一定是想去送死
You must be in a hurry to die.

27
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,020
亨利他们看到你 肯定不爽
Henry James and his boys aren't gonna be as happy to see you as we are.

28
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,890
- 你不是在逃亡 干嘛回来？- 我得把事情解决掉
- You were on the run. Why you back now? - I gotta make things right.

29
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,570
我一直忘不了她
I couldn't stop thinking about her.

30
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,600
- 我以为你是忘不了我们 - 听好…
- And here I thought it was alI about us. - Look...

31
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,130
这是我惹的麻烦 你们不必被拖下水
this is my mess, not yours. You don't have to make this run.

32
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,150
- 你一个人搞不定 - 你需要我们
- We can't let you have all the fun. - You're gonna need us.

33
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,650
没错
Yes, I am.

34
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,620
你还会骑车吧？
Still know how to ride that thing?

35
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,260
来比一比就知道啰
We'll have to race the twisties to find out.

36
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,090
福特 你到底想干嘛？
Ford, what the hell are you doing?

37
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,230
我想看你被我超车的衰样
I don't want to miss that look on your face when I blow past you.

38
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,160
搞什么？
What the ?

39
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,410
- 有人追上来了 - 滚开 臭小子
- We got company. - Out of my way, punk!

40
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,910
他有毛病吗？
What's his problem?

41
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,820
让我来
I got him!

42
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,760
- 你死定了 - 放马过来
- Your ass is mine. - Let's go, punk.

43
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,990
你行吗？
Come on, what you got?

44
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,260
- 怎样？- 有本事来呀
- You like that? - Bring that piece of shit on.

45
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,530
我烧起来了…
I'm burning, I'm burning.

46
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,810
- 别冲动 - 烧死他最好
- Relax! - You should've let him burn!

47
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,540
他差点害死我们
He could've killed us!

48
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,950
小子 咱们走着瞧 让开
Hey, punk, we ain't done yet. Move out of the way.

49
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,460
让我看这小子有什么能耐
Let's see if this guy fights as bad as he rides.

50
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,960
- 滚吧 - 大嘴巴…
- Walk away. - You got loud pipes...

51
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,340
别光说不练
but you ain't saying nothing!

52
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,380
你不会有好下场的
You ain't gonna like how this ends.

53
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,730
这下你死定了 白小子
It's your turn to burn, white boy.

54
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,120
朱利尔 你掉了东西
What's up, J? Drop something?

55
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,380
我会搞定他们 老大
Just taking care of some business, T.

56
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,320
福特 听说你跑到东南亚吃寿司
Ford. I heard you was up in Indochina eating sushi and shit.

57
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,250
- 寿司不是日本才有吗？- 我知道啦 臭小子
- I thought sushi came from Japan. - I know where sushi come from, nigga.

58
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,130
我又没在问你
I ain't even talking to you.

59
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,330
我大可以把你揍扁
You know I could smash you right now.

60
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,470
还有你的小啰喽
You and your little tricycle friends.

61
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,580
不过我就放你一马
But I'm gonna give you a pass.

62
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,170
算是欢迎你回来
Consider it a welcome-home present.

63
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,020
只有一个条件 赔我小弟一台新机车
Under one condition. Somebody gonna give my brother a new bike.

64
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,170
- 我要他的车 - 想得美
- I want his bike. - I ain't giving you shit.

65
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,210
想要机车就放马过来
There's only one way you're getting one of these bikes.

66
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,080
我知道你离开了很久 福特
I know you been gone a long time, Ford.

67
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,750
但不至于忘了这儿谁是老大
But not long enough to forget who run things around here.

68
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,250
小心我拿你去喂狗
I hate to see you end up as Dojo's dinner.

69
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,840
老大 有警察
Trey. One-time.

70
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,250
现在不是喂狗的好时候
Probably not a good time to be feeding Dojo anything, huh?

71
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,900
改天再找你算帐
Get that bike from you later.

72
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,670
警察伯伯 你好吗？
Hey, officer, how's it going?

73
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,960
今天天气真好
Beautiful day today.

74
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,820
- 你还在等什么？- 你觉得怎样？
- What are you waiting for? - What you think?

75
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,640
让他们瞧瞧你的厉害
Go show these boys how to ride.

76
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,030
- 载我一程怎样？- 我会让你受不了
- How about a ride? - This thing might be too much for you.

77
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,090
- 没试过 不知道 - 你们够了吧
- We'll never know till I'm on it. - All right, you too.

78
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,840
我先走一步啰
It's not that I don't enjoy your company.

79
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,830
对他温柔点
Just be gentle with him.

80
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,140
- 好帅的机车 - 好翘的屁股
- Nice bike. - Nice ass.

81
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,080
你有名字吗？
Got a name?

82
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,950
有啊
Yeah.

83
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,870
福特 他跑来干嘛？
Ford. What's he doing here?

84
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,310
天气预报 今天阳光普照
Forecast for today sun, sun and more sun.

85
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,840
华氏94到103度 记得擦防晒油
Highs 94 to 103. Don't forget your sunscreen, folks.

86
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,420
西南风时速10到15里…
Southwest winds 10 to 15 miles per hour, with locally higher gusts.

87
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,100
请稍等一下
Be with you in a second.

88
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,680
要找什么吗？
Looking for something in particular?

89
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:21,120
你有没有粉红色皮座椅？镶金边的？
Yeah, you got one of them seats in a pink Naugahyde? Maybe with a little gold fringe?

90
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,860
你从来都不会搞笑
You never were funny, Ford.

91
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,790
你以前觉得我很搞笑
Oh, come on, you used to think I was funny.

92
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,410
也许你失去幽默感 夏恩
Maybe you lost your sense of humor.

93
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,980
我还是很有幽默感呀
I think I have a pretty good sense of humor.

94
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,790
就像你那天早上一落跑 联邦探员就拿着搜票冲进店里…
Like the morning you skipped town before agents raided my shop...

95
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,880
说我男友是个毒贩？
waving warrants, telling me my boyfriend's a drug dealer?

96
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,380
超搞笑的 我笑了几个礼拜
That was funny. I laughed my ass off for weeks.

97
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,680
我有写信给你
I wrote you letters.

98
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,100
- 我把信给烧了 - 我打过电话给你
- I made fires. - I tried to call.

99
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,190
这半年来我的电话被监听 这也很搞笑
Yeah, but my phone was tapped for six months. That was fun too.

100
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,650
- 听我解释 - 让我猜猜
- Can I explain? - Let me guess.

101
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,400
你很抱歉 你不是故意伤害我 你只是想保护我
You're sorry, you didn't mean to hurt me, you were trying to protect me...

102
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,680
- 而且这不是你的错 - 这是我的错
- and it wasn't your fauIt. - It was my fauIt.

103
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,770
- 打烊了 - 可是招牌说…
- We're closed. - The sign said...

104
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,010
招牌写错了 谢了
Well, the sign lied. Thanks.

105
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,230
你也走吧
You too, Ford.

106
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,080
我一直在想该怎么跟你解释
You don't know how many times I've played this out in my head in the last six months.

107
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,420
你一定把脑袋都想破了
Must be frustrating.

108
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,630
算你有种回来
You got balls even coming here.

109
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:34,450
联邦探员跟地狱帮都在找你 亨利认为你偷走他的机车
The feds and the Hellions are after you and Henry James thinks you stole his bikes.

110
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,300
是啊
Yeah.

111
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,110
因为那是真的
Well, that's because I did.

112
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,590
- 福特 - 干嘛？
- Ford? - Yeah?

113
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,960
- 快走吧 否则… - 否则怎样？
- Go now, please, before I... - Before what?

114
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,410
我们本来决定要去海滩玩
And to think we almost decided to go to the beach this weekend.

115
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,760
幸好小路不喜欢游泳
Lucky for me, Luther hates to swim.

116
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,580
亨利
Henry.

117
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,470
你不必买新的座椅 福特
I don't know why you're buying a new seat, Ford.

118
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,120
旧的湊合着用就好了
Looks like you haven't broken in your old one yet.

119
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,480
看来福特爱用贱货
Looks like Ford prefers to ride bitch to me.

120
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,520
看来你最好也换一个新货 亨利
It looks to me like you ought to buy a new seat yourseIf, Henry.

121
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,890
老跟兄弟合用会染上怪病
Share one with your friends long enough and you're liable to catch something.

122
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,560
听说你去了东南亚
Heard you were in Indochina.

123
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,450
鸟不生蛋的地方
Some shit like that.

124
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,720
- 食物好吃吗？- 我是去泰国
- Good food there? - Thailand, actually...

125
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,570
食物超棒 多谢关心
but the food was great. Thanks for asking.

126
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,300
你真会装蒜 福特
You're a pretty funny guy, Ford.

127
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,200
别装了…
Tell me...

128
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,850
给我老实说
you got a punch line for this

129
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,280
我的机车呢？
Where are my goddamn bikes?

130
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,830
你真的想要那些机车…
You really want them...

131
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,660
还是那里面的货？
or what's inside them?

132
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,120
在哪里？
Where are they?

133
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,890
- 跟他分吧 - 他才不会
- Why don't you just cut it out of him. - No, he won't.

134
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,940
他聪明的很
He's too smart for that.

135
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,260
他知道他一碰我就拿不到货
Because he knows if he touches me he'll never get his shit back.

136
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,480
也许…
Then again...

137
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,770
我没那么聪明
I'm not that smart.

138
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,850
夏恩
Shane.

139
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,180
限你在日落前交出我的机车
You've got till sundown to hand over my bikes.

140
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,250
- 你老弟答应跟我合作 - 朱利尔不能作主 我才是老大
- Your brother said we had a deal. - Junior don't do the deals around here, I do.

141
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:52,090
他不能作主 就不该乱放话
Well, if Junior ain't allowed to make deals, he shouldn't be allowed to speak.

142
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,580
真巧 我也有同感
That's funny, because I was thinking the same thing.

143
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,220
我不是来看你逗狗 黑猩猩
I didn't come here to watch you pet your dog, primate.

144
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,360
我也没请你这臭白人来
I didn't invite your Dukes of Hazzard ass.

145
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,960
快从我眼前消失 我不会答应你的
So you can raise up whenever you feel it. The answer is no.

146
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,520
你不能在我的地盘贩毒
You're not slinging your dope on my streets.

147
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,130
香槟拿给我
Hand me that bottle.

148
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,520
给我听好…
Look...

149
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,300
我不是街头小混混
I'm not some dimebag street punk.

150
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,040
我是生意人
I'm a businessman.

151
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,960
你最好识相点
And I'm telling you to make this right.

152
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,600
就算你是教父我也不甩你
I wouldn't give a shit if you was Don Corleone himseIf.

153
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,570
我的答案还是不
The answer is still no.

154
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,860
给我滚远一点
So get out of my face.

155
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,260
你在看什么？
What the hell was you looking at?

156
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,740
我爱你
I love you.

157
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,680
拜托 你干嘛不答应他？
Trey, what's wrong? I thought you would've been down with that shit.

158
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,390
我们可以海捞一票
You could've made a killing.

159
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,630
你觉得你闯的祸还不够多吗？
First you gonna act a fool up there on the road, now this?

160
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,740
你有什么毛病啊？
What's wrong with you?

161
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,040
别给我找麻烦
You messing with my goddamn good nature, boy.

162
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,860
去买啤酒来 少惹我
Go get me a beer, man. You messing up my buzz.

163
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,250
我要健怡可乐 别甩车门
Get me a Diet Pepsi. Don't slam my door.

164
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,080
你最好别冲动
You better count to 10!

165
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,210
- 我要好好教训他 - 闭嘴 叫伙计跟着他
- I'm gonna whup his ass. - Shut up. Put Rasan and Nomo on him.

166
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,290
连小狗嘟嘟都比他聪明
Dojo got more sense than that boy.

167
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,910
亨利 看来你被他耍了
Henry, looks like you're the one riding bitch.

168
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,940
- 你的引擎该修一修了 - 福特
Looks like your engine could use a little work.

169
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,180
我都说我不爱你 你是混球
What part of "I don't love you anymore, you're a bastard

170
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,400
我不想见到你 你还不死心？
and I never wanna see you again" didn't you understand?

171
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,490
因为你见到我并没有转头就走
How about the part that stops you from driving off right now?

172
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,510
渴了吗？
Thirsty?

173
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,310
一瓶啤酒 你请客
All right, one beer. But you're buying.

174
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:20,070
-朱利尔 你还好吗？-我一点也不好 滚开
- What up, Junior? You all right? - No, I'm definitely not all right, man. Move!

175
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,690
敢撞我 白小子
Watch out, white boy.

176
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,350
- 我是不小心的 - 小心我踢扁你
- Call it an accident? - How about I kick your ass?

177
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,110
我说我是不小心的
No, I prefer we still call it an accident.

178
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,810
- 不小心的？- 你欠我一罐啤酒
- How about now? - Now it looks like you owe me a beer.

179
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,950
- 朱利尔 - 我要宰了你
- Junior! Junior! - I'm gonna kill you!

180
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,220
住手
Come on, chill!

181
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,380
给我过来 你怎么老是给我找麻烦？
I'm gonna talk to you. Why you always got to show your ass, man, huh?

182
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,950
你为什么不能安份一点？
Why you can't come here and play your position?

183
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,600
看着我 小子
Look at me, boy.

184
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,300
我爱你 因为你是我老弟 可是别一直丢我的脸
I love you. You're my brother, but you better stop embarrassing me.

185
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,180
别这么毛毛燥燥
Stop acting so damn crazy.

186
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,820
我会照顾你一辈子
And I got your back for life.

187
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,080
照顾我 那就替我出口气 帮帮我呀
Well, if you got my back, then show me, blood, on everything!

188
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:50,540
你一点都不照顾我 我才不靠你呢
You ain't got my back, man. You ain't got my back, Trey. Forget you, man.

189
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,890
小心 给我让开
Watch out. Get out of my way, man.

190
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,460
白小子差点把你老弟揍扁
Dawson's Creek almost beat your brother's ass, blood.

191
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,510
闭嘴 去牵我的狗
Shut up, man. Go get my dog.

192
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,080
- 你要怎么对付福特？- 朱利尔 给了我灵感
- What're we gonna do about Ford? - Junior just solved our problem.

193
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,770
- 不如把福特抓起来 - 还不行
- Why don't we just grab him right now? - No, not now.

194
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,260
我有更好的主意 叫大伙儿来
I got a better idea. Get the boys.

195
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,080
你是怎么搞的？你一出现就会惹出一堆麻烦
What is it with you, Ford? Everywhere you go, everything turns to hell.

196
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,060
我就是有这本事
Yeah, it's a talent I have.

197
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,680
柴娜 去补补妆
Go powder your nose, China.

198
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,550
咱们玩玩吧
Let's have some fun.

199
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,840
- 是他 去逮他 - 他在那儿
- That's him. Get him. - There he is.

200
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:07,060
多谢地狱帮砸了这场子 我要走人了
We'd like to thank the Hellions for messing up another gig. I'm out of here.

201
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,340
他逃不了
He ain't going anywhere.

202
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,660
- 他来了 - 又走了 去抓他
- Here he comes. - There he goes. Get him!

203
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,750
散人啦 朱利尔
See you, Junior.

204
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,170
怎么回事？
Hey, what's up, man?

205
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,240
怎么回事？
Hey. What's up?

206
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,840
老兄
Hey, dude.

207
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,580
该死
Damn!

208
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,880
你把我害惨了 朱利尔
You screwed me, Junior.

209
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,950
你这小子说话不算话
I assume you're apologizing for setting up a deal you couldn't do.

210
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:13,410
害我白白答应别人
I made promises based on your black ass.

211
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,780
现在问题可大了
And now I've got a problem.

212
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,090
- 你得要帮我解决 - 老兄
- But you're gonna help me out of it. - Yo, dog.

213
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,330
给我一些时间 我去劝崔瑞把事情搞定
Just give me time. I'm gonna talk to Trey. We could work this out, man.

214
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,680
我可以的
I could make this happen, all right?

215
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,080
你没时间了
Time's up.

216
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,590
你知道该怎么做
You know what to do, baby?

217
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,720
曼谷到芭达尼有一条沿海公路
There's this one road that winds up the coast from Bangkok to Pattani.

218
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,160
一边是山 一边是大海
It's got mountains on one side, ocean on the other

219
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,970
骑车时好像可以把脚泡到海水里
so close sometimes it feels like you can just drag your foot in it.

220
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,690
我每次骑在路上就想到你
I tell you, the last six months, every time I took that drive I thought about you.

221
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,350
你想向我促销泰国旅游行程？
Did you come all this way to sell me a trip to Thailand?

222
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,590
一瓶啤酒的时间让你解释
You got to the bottom of this beer. Explain away.

223
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,000
好吧
All right.

224
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:35,680
我一年前认识亨利 我不喜欢他 不过他是客人
First met Henry about a year ago. I didn't like him, but he was a paying customer.

225
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,800
我替他修过车
I fixed his chopper a couple times.

226
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:53,450
半年前他带两台机车到你的店…
Six months ago, he turns up at your shop...

227
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,430
他要我替他保管几天
with these two bikes. He asked me if I'd mind looking after them.

228
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,690
我想一想无所谓
I figure, what the hell, right?

229
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,600
所以就答应他
So I do.

230
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:06,790
我去热车却发动不了 所以就检查油箱
Then I go to move them, they don't start. So I check the tanks.

231
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:10,240
发现里面装满安非他命
They're filled with kilos of crystal meth.

232
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,740
我就想先把机车弄走
So first thing, I get them out of there.

233
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,670
怪不得联邦探员会来搜我的店
So that's why that fed McPherson raided my shop after you split.

234
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:22,720
你也从地球上消失
And you dropped off the face of the Earth.

235
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,110
我之所以走…
I took off...

236
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,440
是不想把你拖下水
so that you wouldn't get dragged into it.

237
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,750
只要我一走
I split.

238
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,750
警方就以为只有我跟亨利同伙
Now I'm the only one involved with Henry.

239
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,320
你走是为了保护我？
So you left to protect me?

240
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,750
你是怎么想的？你可以回来把一切解释清楚…
What'd you think, you were gonna just come back and explain everything...

241
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:49,970
然后再跟我远走高飞？
and then we'd just ride off into the sunset together?

242
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,970
差不多吧
More or less.

243
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,340
你差不多想去哪里？
Well, which is it? More or less?

244
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,850
我想去墨西哥
Well, I was actually thinking Mexico.

245
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,580
- 别坏了我的好事 - 把衣服穿好
- You're killing me. - Get your gear on.

246
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,400
- 现在不行 - 咱们去墨西哥 夏恩一起去
- Not a good time. - Heading to Cabo. Shane's coming.

247
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,310
- 真的假的？- 真的
- Damn, really? - Yeah.

248
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,670
- 等我十分钟 - 快一点
- Give me 10 minutes, all right? - Come on.

249
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,880
让开
Move.

250
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,990
让开 让开
Move, man! Move!

251
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,170
可恶
Damn!

252
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,280
他是我小弟
Wait. That's my brother, man.

253
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,840
没关系
It's all right.

254
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,320
不 我要带你走
Oh, no. No, man. I'm taking him with me.

255
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,880
不行
You can't do that, son.

256
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,200
我们要查出真凶
Now, we're gonna find out who done this.

257
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,490
如果你知道谁杀死你小弟…
If you have any ideas who would want to kill your brother

258
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,520
如果我知道是谁 他早就没命了
If I knew who did this, you'd have two dead bodies right now.

259
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,860
有一个人声称看到凶手
We got a witness. Says she saw the whole thing.

260
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,040
二十来岁白人 骑着重型机车
A white male, mid-20s, rode a custom motorcycle.

261
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,890
- 身穿黑橘色皮衣 - 黑橘色皮衣？
- Wore black and orange leathers. - Black and orange leathers?

262
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:45,150
你知道这个人吗？
Hey, you know somebody who fits that description?

263
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,410
不再知道了

What'd you expect? A cheap suit, late-model Taurus, a $10 haircut?

你们怎么这么快就赶到？

So, what are you gonna do about Henry? We got a plan, right?

300
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:40,780
等风头过了 我会说出机车下落
Yeah, once we're in the clear, I'm gonna tell Henry where he can pick up his shit.

301
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,200

我也会通知麦费森探员
I'm also gonna call that punk McPherson and tell him.

让他逮到亨利 人赃俱全
Arrange a get-together with the evidence.

304

这样就皆大欢喜 对吧？

FBI 认为是你干的
Feds think you did it.

328

Reapers think you did it. Hell, everybody thinks you did it.

329
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,380
只要你交出货 我就能让你脱身
You tell me where my stuff is and it all goes away.

330
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,250
我不听别人命令
I don't take orders, Henry.

331
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,250
- 从前和以后都不会 - 什么？
- Never have, never will. - What's that?

332
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,200
你听过恶有恶报这句俗语吗？
Ever heard that what you put out comes back tenfold?

333
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,040
你在"支那"待太久了 那是什么意思？
You spent too much time in Chink Land, Ford. What does that mean?

334
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:18,980
你大限来时我可不想在你旁边
It means I don't wanna be next to you when the shit hits the fan.

335
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,600
而且"支那"是中国
And by the way, Henry "Chink Land" implies China.

336
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,400

别开枪
Quit shooting!

341
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,720
你找错人了
You got the wrong guy.

342
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,160
等警长来再说
We'll let the sheriff sort it out when they get here.

343
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,480
- 你没事吧？- 我搞定他们了
- Are you okay? - I got it under control!

344
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,820
我没有杀人
I didn't kill anybody.

345
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,290
妈的
Shit!

346
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,400
你是厄尔吗？
You Earl?

347
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,790
你做的早餐超好吃
Loved your French toast.

348
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,710
- 趴下来 - 我就说…

- I love a girl who can take care of herseIf. - Thanks.

350
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,640

You're on the news. That guy you got in a fight with is dead.

351
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,480
- 亨利要拿回他的毒品 - 你怎么不还给他？
- Henry set me up. He wants his drugs back. - Why don't you give them back.

352
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,050
- 不行 那是我唯一的保障 - 昨晚我们一起
- I can't. It's the only insurance I got. - You were with me last night.

353
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,030
- 你有不在场证明 - 趴下来 厄尔
I'm your alibi. Down, Earl!

354
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,140
去跟警察说呀
Tell the cops.

355
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,020
警察不是唯一的麻烦
Right now it ain't the cops that I'm worried about.

356
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,610
情况不妙
Not good.

357
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,820
- 死神帮来了 - 他说的对 夏恩
- Reapers! - He's right, Shane.

358
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:32,110
待会再说行吗？
You think we could finish this conversation later?

359
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,550
好吧 脱了险你就要报警 好吗？
All right. Once we're in the clear, you call the cops. Agreed?

360
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,650
我拿这个干嘛？
What should I do with this?

361
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,800
就当我没说过我喜欢悍妞
Forget what I said about liking women who can take care of themselves.

362
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,980
抱歉 事情不太妙 你留下来比较安全
Sorry, it's gonna get crazy. You'll be safer here than running with us.

363
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,680
- 回洛杉矶再见 - 你要我干嘛？
- See you back in L.A. - What am I supposed to do?

364
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,870
陪厄尔吗？
Hang out with Earl?

365
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,230
他们往哪儿走？
Which way?

366
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,440
快给我说 老头
Which way did you say, old man?

367
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,080
- 哪个方向？- 抄小路
- Which way? - Shortcut!

368
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,970
逮到他们就宰了他们
Let's catch them, kill them and bury them!

369
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,660
他们追上来了 该死 越来越多人
They're still on us! Shit! There's more of them!

370
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,210
- 怎么办？- 要往哪儿？
- What are we gonna do, Ford? - Where we going?

371
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,930
我正在想
I'm working on it!

372
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,630
他们走哪边？
Which way did they go?

373
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,480
可恶 走吧
Damn! Come on!

374
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,630
可以报警了吗？
Now can we call the cops?

375
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,570
- 不行 - 为什么？
- No. - Why not?

376
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,690
不只是警察 是麦费森
Because it's not just the cops, it's McPherson.

377
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,940
麦费森？
McPherson?

378
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,270
抄你店的家伙
The guy that tore up your shop.

379
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,320
他认为我是毒贩
He already thinks I'm a drug dealer.

380
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:02,500
现在又认为我杀死朱利尔 所以我一定要证明…
Now he thinks I shot Junior. And he has no reason to think otherwise...

381
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,760
- 自己无罪 - 真倒霉 链条断了
- unless I can prove it. - Bad just turned to worse. Bent link.

382
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,850
真是屋漏偏逢连夜雨
This just keeps getting better and better.

383
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,220
我的工具箱有备用链条
I got a spare in my toolkit.

384
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:15,280
他是被勒死的
He was strangled, by the way.

385
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,860
- 谁？- 朱利尔 是被机车链条勒死
- Who? - Junior. He was strangled with a bike chain.

386
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,560
妈的
Shit.

387
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,930
是亨利用自己的机车链条
Henry used the chain off his own bike.

388
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,930
- 你怎么知道？- 是啊 你怎么知道？
- How do you know that? - How do you know?

389
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,430
你怎么会知道的？
Yeah, how did you know that?

390
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,030
这个嘛…
Well, it's....

391
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,690
事情有点复杂
It's complicated.

392
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,000
- 你不左转就会去俄勒冈 - 应该右转
- You turning left, or we going to Oregon? - It's right.

393
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,830
右转？怎么？
It's right? What...?

394
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,390
别乱指我 我知道路
Get the finger out of my face. I know where I'm going.

395
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,430
亨利这下死定了
Henry just screwed himseIf.

396
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,910
- 你看到这些刮痕吗？- 嗯
- See those scratches and nicks? - Yeah.

397
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,380
这是齿盘刮出来的
Well, it picks them up from the sprocket.

398
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,530
每一台机车的刮痕都不同
Now, no two bikes got the same chain-wear pattern...

399
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,750
因为每个齿盘的磨损痕迹都不同
because no two sprockets are the same.

400
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,820
只要能证明亨利的链条是凶器
So we match the chain used to kill Junior with Henry's bike...

401
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,340
就能逮到他
and we got him.

402
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,620
就跟指纹一样
Like a fingerprint.

403
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,320
就连你这白痴也搞懂了耶
Try not to move your lips so much when you think.

404
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:22,010
现在可以报警了吧？
Now we call the cops, right?

405
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,180
可以了
Now we call the cops.

406
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,520
- 好恶心哦 - 去开房间吧
- Real cute, guys. - Get a room.

407
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,700
- 麦费森？- 福特 你越来越厉害了
- McPherson, it's F... - Ford. Looks like you're trading up.

408
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,480
从毒贩变成一级谋杀犯
Going from drug trafficking to first-degree murder.

409
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,800
- 我被人陷害 - 这句话我常听
- I was set up. - In my business I hear that a lot.

410
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,840
- 大声点 我正在侧录 - 谁会想陷害你？
- Loud. Recorder's on. - Who wants to set you up?

411
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,100
亨利
Henry James.

412
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,520
地狱帮老大 为什么呢？
Leader of the Hellions. Now, why would he wanna do that?

413
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:00,320
你要找的毒品是他的
Those drugs you were looking for belong to Henry.

414
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,620
你去抄店前一晚 我把货藏起来 亨利要讨回去
I stashed them the night before you raided the shop. He wants them back.

415
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:07,780
说出毒品下落 也许我会相信
Tell me where the drugs are, I might buy that'd give Henry motive.

416
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,480
- 也许我能让你脱罪 - 也许还不够好 把亨利抓起来
- Maybe we can work something out. - "Maybe" don't cut it. Arrest Henry...

417
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,240
- 我就交出毒品 - 逮捕他？凭什么？
- then I'll take you to the drugs. - Arrest him? On what grounds?

418
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,010
一级谋杀罪
First-degree murder.

419
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,690
- 我能证明凶器出于亨利之手 - 不太可能
- What if I tie the murder weapon to Henry? - Big "if"

420
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,800
逮捕他
Arrest him.

421
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,360
- 去拿他的车 我就把毒品交给你 - 去拿他的车 好
- Get his bike, I'll show you. - Get his bike. Okay.

422
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,410
你还要我逮捕谁呢？前女友 小学老师？
Anyone else you'd like me to arrest? Ex-girlfriend, second-grade teacher...?

423
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,960
- 等一下 我抄下来 - 你有没有在听
- Hold on, I'm making a list. - You're not listening to me.

424
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,280
- 亨利杀死朱利尔 - 我才不信
- Henry killed Junior. - I don't know that.

425
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,060
那你就帮不了我
Then you can't help me!

426
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,070
这方法不管用
Well, that didn't fly.

427
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,600
管它的 咱们去墨西哥吧
Screw it. Let's haul ass down to Mexico and don't look back.

428
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,270
这次我也同意
As much as I hate to say it, I agree with him.

429
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:00,620
- 我们要回洛杉矶 - 你这是自投罗网
- We're going to L.A. - Oh, yeah. That makes sense.

430
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,760
我要靠亨利的毒品替我脱罪
I have to get Henry's bike. That will clear me.

431
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,390
每条路都会有警方临检站
They'll have checkpoints on every dirt road between here and the coast.

432
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,610
骑重型机车太招摇了
We're not exactly hard to spot driving these.

433
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:14,680
- 你想把机车丢掉？- 不 骑车比较快
- You wanna ditch the bikes? - No, I'd rather be fast than invisible.

434
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,970
如果太容易就不好玩 对吧？
Come on. Wouldn't be any fun if it was easy, right?

435
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,420
我从不担心下一公里会怎样
I live my life a quarter mile at a time.

436
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,730
这是我听过最蠢的话
That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

437
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,360
每条公路都有警方临检站
Po-po got the highways blocked from here to L.A.

438
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,880
洛杉矶？
L.A.?

439
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,470
他怎么会笨到自投罗网？
Why would he go to the one place he know I got on lockdown?

440
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,850
- 咱们在州际公路堵他 - 他没那么笨
- Let's catch him on the interstate. - No, he's smarter than that.

441
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,130
他想偷溜回去
He trying to backdoor us.

442
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,440
一定会穿过沙漠
He going through the Palms.

443
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,700
我就会走那儿 去堵他吧
That's the way I'd go. And that's the way we going.

444
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:13,680
亨利去年因为持有毒品入狱
You know, Henry James did pull six months in L.A. County last year for possession.

445
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:17,050
也许福特说的有道理
Maybe Ford is onto something.

446
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,470
那你就帮不了我
Then you can't help me!

447
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,410
叫警方检查前往洛城的每条路
Call in. Check everything from Lone Pine and L.A.

448
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:30,050
- 福特真的会回洛杉矶？- 他要回去找亨利
- You think Ford's going back to L.A.? - He's going after Henry James.

449
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,940
如果是我被人陷害 我就会回去 走吧
If he's right and Henry did set him up, that's what I'd do. Let's go!

450
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,630
- 你没付油钱 - 对喔
- You have to pay for the gas. - Oh, right.

451
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,020
死神帮
Reapers!

452
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,700
- 我们在沙漠甩掉他们 - 你疯了吗？
- We'll lose them in the Palms! - Are you crazy?

453
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,260
我最讨厌他这样
I hate it when he does this!

454
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:13,720
- 他们骑进树林 - 我看到了 紧跟着福特
- They going into the trees! - I could see that, fool! Stay on Ford.

455
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,170
- 我快逮到他了 - 他们开枪了 福特
- I got his ass! - They're shooting at us, Ford!

456
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:45,820
- 我知道 - 怎么办？
- I know! - What do we do?

457
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,940
你往右 他们只会追我
Go right! They'll follow me!

458
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,300
吃子弹吧
Meet the twins!

459
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,020
来吧 福特
All right, Ford!

460
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,190
咱们俩对决吧
Just you and me, baby!

461
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,560
你不该欺负女生
Shouldn't pick on girls.

462
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:15,620
你没事吧？
You all right?

463
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,930
我骑车从急驶列车的车顶跳下来
I just jumped my bike onto the roof of a moving train.

464
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,650
人在危急时能激发神奇的潜能
It's amazing what you can do when you have no choice.

465
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,960
小威跟小刀呢？
Where are Val and DaIton?

466
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:38,470
他赢了我 我差点就没命
He had me, dog. He had me. I was gone!

467
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:41,110
他却及时救我一命
He's the one snatched me up out of there!

468
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,770
我搞不懂 他不像是凶手
I'm trying to figure out why. He ain't acting like no killer!

469
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,500
我只知道你小弟挂了 他在逃亡
Your brother's dead and cracker's on the run.

470
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,830
我觉得不太对劲 这整件事感觉怪怪的
Shit don't feel right. Don't sound right, don't look right.

471
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,690
只有抓到他才能搞清楚
Only way we can find out is to get our hands on him.

472
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,310
- 我同意 - 那就快出发吧
- I'm with that. - Then get your black ass up and let's go!

473
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,110
大伙儿走吧
Everybody, let's go!

474
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,510
小威第一次骑得比你快
First time Val's beat you anywhere!

475
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,920
你一定是被女人耽误了
Must be the chick.

476
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,900
是啊 我停下来修个指甲
Yeah, I stopped for a manicure.

477
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:24,560
你要听坏消息吗？每一条公路都有临检站
Want this hour's bad news? Every major road in L.A. is blocked.

478
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,670
你说太容易就不好玩
I know you said it wouldn't be any fun if it was easy...

479
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,680
可是也不需要这样玩命吧
but does it have to be this much fun?

480
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:40,260
你要怎么替我脱罪？
You said you could make this go away. How?

481
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:44,630
有时候证人很健忘
Sometimes witnesses forget what they saw.

482
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,730
或是拒绝作证
Refuse to testify.

483
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,430
等我回洛杉矶…
You still want your shit back...

484
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:53,010
再把货还给你 明天下午三点
I'll call you when I get to L.A. 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

485
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,920
干嘛？
What?

486
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:05,220
事情有点不对劲 福特不像杀人凶手
Jay, something doesn't sit with me. Ford doesn't profile up as a killer.

487
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:08,180
你的直觉真灵光 韩德森
Yeah? Good instincts, Henderson.

488
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:12,720
半年前我给福特一次机会 他却落跑了
Listen, I gave Ford a chance to tell the truth six months ago. He ran.

489
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:15,830
昨晚我再次给他机会 他又落跑
I gave him another chance last night. He ran again.

490
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:20,680
无辜的人是不会落跑的
Innocent men, Henderson, don't run.

491
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,160
他上钩了
He went for it!

492
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,470
现在只要躲过几百个警察就行
Now we just gotta get past the several hundred cops between us and L.A.

493
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:31,410
希望你这次是计划好了
God, I hope you have a plan this time.

494
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:35,370
我是有计划
Yeah, I got a plan.

495
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,200
你们想撇下我吗？
You gonna leave without me?

496
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,980
我的老天
Oh, my God.

497
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,390
你们看
Check it out, man.

498
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,100
哇塞
Holy shit.

499
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:27,900
看到三个飚车族跟一个小妞吗？
Seen three bikers and a chick on a couple of crotch rockets in the last hour?

500
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,590
这儿的人都蠢到极点
Must be something in the water up here.

501
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:35,650
我说的话你一定听不懂
Okay. Words strung together into sentences obviously bewilder you.

502
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,940
让我再说一次
Let me try again.

503
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,580
三个男的…
Three dudes...

504
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,950
一个女的…
a girl...

505
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,200
两台摩托车
and a couple of bikes.

506
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,950
- 不知道 有很多卡车司机 - 是吗？
- Don't know. Seen a lot of truckers. - Really?

507
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,020
有一个妞儿
One girl.

508
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,400
- 她的身材超火辣 - 闭嘴
- Man, you should've seen the pair... - Shut up.

509
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,890
监看摄影机有用吗？
Does this thing work?

510
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,040
福特 你有病吗？
Ford. What is wrong with you?

511
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,600
抱歉
Sorry.

512
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:16,310
- 坏了吗？- 对
- Is it fried? - Yeah.

513
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:30,980
你没说你为什么选择去泰国
So you never actually told me why you chose Thailand.

514
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,200
我想去个不会让我想起你的地方
Well, I just wanted to go someplace that wouldn't remind me of you.

515
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,200
是吗？
Oh, yeah?

516
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,620
结果有用吗？
How did that work out for you?

517
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,340
- 没什么用 - 是吗？
- Not real well. - No?

518
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,840
承认吧
Oh, come on, admit it.

519
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,890
你很高兴我回来
You're so glad I came back.

520
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,400
我只是这周末闲着没事干
I just had nothing better to do this weekend.

521
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,520
高速公路上干嘛忽然停车？
Why we stopping in the middle of the interstate?

522
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,180
临检站
Roadblock.

531
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,950
艾德 这么快就回来了？
Hey, Ed! What are you doing back so soon?

532

明晚我在洛城有一场比赛

福特应该打电话来了
Ford should've called us by now.

538
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,640
他这一路很顺 别紧张
He's just having a good run. Don't sweat it, man.

539
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:02,710
要是福特不合作…
We got over a mil riding on this!

540
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,300
拿不到一百万的货 我就得坐牢
We're looking at life in prison if Ford doesn't go down as planned.

541
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,940
别叫我不要紧张
Don't tell me not to sweat it.

542
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,590
吃你的糖去 给我闭上狗嘴
So grab yourseIf a candy bar and shut your mouth.

543
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,920

That's a sweet hog, man. Look at that beast!

544
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:41,330
飚车万岁 或比手势
Live to ride. Or that. Yeah.

545
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:44,120
可以让我们拍张相吗？

我们在旅行 我们要把照片寄给各地网友
We're on a road trip, we e-mail people on our buddy list where we're at.

547
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,900
可以吗？谁是小情侣？
Could we do that? Who's in love?

548
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,280
- 他们是 - 就在那
- They are. - Right there.

549
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,320
笑一个 有点人样
Give me a big smile, like you guys are human.

550
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,360
他眨眼 她也眨眼 再拍一次
He blinked and she blinked. Look at this. Let's do it again.

551
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:59,200

笑一个
Smile.

553
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:16,780
又怎么了？
Now what?

554
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,530
你要懂得如何理财
It's also about financial freedom.

555
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,140
- 需要帮忙吗？- 把货柜打开
- What can I do for you? - Why don't you open up the back for me.

556
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,160
这辆卡车好长
That's a long truck.

557
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,810
别碰我
Don't touch me.

558
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:53,470
- 奇怪了 - 什么？
- That's weird. - What?

559
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:55,300
锁不见了
My lock's gone.

560
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,980
你在等绿灯吗？
You waiting for a green light?

561
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,640
- 让一让 - 卡车抛锚 叫拖吊车
- Let's go, make a hole! - Truck's broke. Call a tow truck.

562
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,670
- 好了没？- 上车 我来开
- Are you done? - Get in. I'm driving.

563
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:46,360
死警察
Fuck the police!

564
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,910
- 那是威胁吗？- 应该是
- Was that a threat? - I think it was.

565
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:25,380
前面塞车
Ford, traffic!

566
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,650
所以我才讨厌开车
This is why I hate four wheels.

567
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:34,080
你先逃走
Hey, you're gonna have to make a break!

568
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:37,620
- 我们一起逃 - 你跟小威带夏恩逃走
- We go together! - No, you and Val can get Shane out of this!

569
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,930
不要 我要跟你走
No way, I'm going with you!

570
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:51,940
- 你不能跟我 - 你真可恶
- No, you're not. - Goddamn it, Ford!

571
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:02,120
我就知道你喜欢我
I always knew you had a thing for me.

572
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,020
快把她带走
Get her out of here!

573
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,530
喂
Hey!

574
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,080
小心
Watch out.

575
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:31,180
我不能忍受 我要把机车退回去 你把机车收回去
And I'm not gonna stand for it. I wanna return the bike. You can take it back.

576
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:40,880
我不能退是什么意思？我才骑了二百多里
What do you mean I can't bring it back? Okay, there's only 200 miles on the bike.

577
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:44,090
你敢再说…
If you say one more word....

578
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,570
王八蛋
Asshole!

579
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,070
喂？他又挂我电话
Hello? Hung up again!

580
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:06,600
- 臭飚车族 - 你疯了 快叫支援
- Bikers. - This is crazy! We can call backup.

581
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:11,320
你不喜欢我开车 就去搭顺风车
If you don't like my driving, Henderson, you can get out and hitch.

582
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,300
不是吧
No way!

583
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,520
幸好有安全气囊 别说话
Thank God for airbags. Shut up.

584
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,740
- 来吧 福特 - 你误会我了
- Come on, Ford. - You got this wrong!

585
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,450
哎呀
Damn!

586
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,060
妈的 疯白人
Damn! Crazy white boy!

587
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:52,210
我不想…
Look, man, I don't wanna...

588
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,560
你够种跟我单挑吗？
You think you man enough to drop that hammer?

589
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,000
我不想 朱利尔也不是我杀的
Don't want to. I didn't kill Junior either.

590
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:04,400
如果是的话 我就不会救你一命
If I did, I would've let you die at the tracks.

591
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:10,220
- 你为什么不跟我解释？- 我想你一定不会听
- Why didn't you stick around and talk? - I didn't think this would go all that well.

592
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,060
好吧 他是谁杀的？
All right. You didn't kill him, who did?

593
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,680
是亨利 他陷害我
Henry James. He set me up.

594
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,360
你要我相信你的话？
So I'm supposed to just believe what you say now?

595
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:27,010
你等着瞧 我会逮到他
Well, see for yourseIf. I'm taking him down.

596
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:30,550
到时候你不相信 再毙了我
You don't believe me, you can always shoot me then.

597
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,790
你掉了这玩意
You dropped this.

598
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,440
这最好是好消息
This better be someone with good news or money.

599
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:49,940
我可以让你逮到凶手 同时把毒品交给你
What would you say if I gave you Junior's killer and Henry's drugs at the same time?

600
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,970
哪里？
Where?

601
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,980
你知道地方 半年前你抄过她的店
You know the address. You busted its doors down about six months ago.

602
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,940
两小时后见
Meet me there in two hours.

603
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,130
安非他命
Crystal meth.

604
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:36,240
你能不能帮帮忙？
I don't suppose we got a spare set of hands?

605
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:46,910
- 干嘛？- 什么干嘛
- Yeah? - Don't "yeah" me.

606
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,680
有什么动静？
How we doing over there?

607
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,950
只有我跟一大堆鱼
It's just me and the fishes, man.

608
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:54,230
有美人鱼我会通知你
If a mermaid pops up, I'll call you.

609
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,480
- 待在道尔顿那儿 - 好
- Just stay there at Dalton's. - Yeah.

610
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,530
这儿真舒适
It's lovely here.

611
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:04,970
过一会儿见
I'll see you in a little while.

612
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:07,700
小心点 好吗？
Just be careful, all right?

613
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:11,440
- 你知道我的 - 所以我才会担心
- Well, you know me. - Yeah, that's why I'm worried.

614
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,060
搞定了我再打给你
I'll call you when it's over.

615
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:25,440
- 会是什么人？- 我叫了披萨
- Who the hell is that? - I ordered pizza.

616
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:29,050
- 不会吧？- 真的
- You're kidding me, right? - No.

617
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,690
- 你不是开玩笑 - 我一紧张就想吃
- You're not kidding? - I eat when I'm nervous.

618
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,650
他随时都想吃 他是爱吃鬼
He eats when he's horny. He just likes to eat.

619
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,780
你好吗？
How you doing?

620
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:50,830
我看他是不会来了
Seems like your boy ain't coming.

621
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,520
现在怎么办？
Now what?

622
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:57,740
他一定会来 相信我
He'll be here. Trust me.

623
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:02,070
如果我要拿回价值百万的毒品…
Tell me you got a million dollars' worth of my ice?

624
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,470
我一定会准时
I'd try to be punctual.

625
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,140
你又不是亨利
You ain't Henry.

626
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:48,900
他一定会来
He'll be here.

627

Put the gun on the ground and slide it to me, now.

You're supposed to wait for Henry. Didn't you learn anything in FBI school?

638

Ford, shut up.

我又可以嫁祸给你
I get to pin this murder on you...

648
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:18,760
因为大家都知道你杀了朱利尔
